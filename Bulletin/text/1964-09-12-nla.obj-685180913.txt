WHICH CAR
MAKES NEW
MEAN WHAT
IT MEANS?
The only new thing about some cars is
the name. Not this one. BMC Morris
1100 is all new—from bonnet to boot!
It’s the car you hoped would happen.
It breaks through with revolutionary
engineering. Take, for example, the
Hydroiastic* suspension. It floats the
car on fluid so it can’t bounce or roll
or pitch. And it never needs mainten-
ance. Take the special sealed cooling
system. Take the sound-dampening
rubber-mounted sub-frames. Take all
that stretch-out inside space. Why not
take the BMC Morris 1100? and
ride in the cushioned comfort of con-
toured seating. Listen to approving
comments from friends at the sweet,
low styling; from mechanics at the
front-wheel drive system that pad'
engine, clutch and gearbox into on]
amazing unit. The BMC Morris 1101.
looks like the future and actj
like it. It’s the car that puts thj
family first. Now’s the time to try thi
Miraculous BMC Morris 1100 —th
car you hoped would happen.

LETTERS
TO THE
EDITOR
“THE INTELLECTUAL ELITE”
Sir,
Many of us today are finding it in-
creasingly difficult to tolerate the pub-
lished utterances of self-appointed intel-
lectuals such as Professor May
(15/8/64). Perhaps the fact that they
are tolerated is a sign that Australians
have reached a true intellectual maturity
and have passed beyond the adolescent
stage of calling filth by any other name
than filth.
It may be that Professor May has not
been in this country long enough to visit
our schools to hear for himself our
Leaving Certificate (and younger) stu-
dents discussing the homosexual agony,
as he calls it. What he would hear would
not be a discussion, but merely a refer-
ence to “a couple of bloody queens”
who would then be dismissed with the
contempt healthy-minded youths reserve
for matters beneath their consideration.
What further discussion should there
be? One can hardly expect much debate
from those who have not lived long
enough to know that the mentally sick
should be pitied and not vilified however
much their perversions may disgust the
healthy.
Apparently the learned professor be-
lieves that it is our intellectual imma-
turity that leads us to support our police
on Commemoration Day, but has he
taken the trouble to ascertain what pro-
portion of our students engage in activi-
ties which bring police action; indeed,
what proportion of the students take
part in Commemoration Day stunts at
all? It is suggested that those who do take
part are the intellectuals of our univer-
sities?
And the elite books that the elite may
not read who defines elite? Are Pro-
fessor May’s elite those who enjoy the
filth and pornography that is so often
foisted upon us today and called good
literature? If so, God help us lesser
mortals who still enjoy beauty in writing
and word imagery in preference to a
good, hard kick in the teeth.

“BEAUTIFULLY COOKED”
Sir,
A story that went the rounds of the
British Eighth Army during the war in
the desert concerned the unsuccessful
attempts of the commander of a platoon
on detachment to obtain a volunteer to
act as cook. Finally, so the story went,
he had to detail a man for the job, and
promised him that he would be relieved
by the first man to complain about the
cooking.
The reluctant cook took the logical
course of concocting the vilest dishes in a
desperate attempt to get someone to
complain, and thus relieve him of the
unpopular job. After a week of progres-
sively worse meals, and not a complaint
in sight, the cook visited the area of a
nearby Indian mule company. He collec-
ted up the manure from the ground, put
it in his dixie with the vegetables, boiled
it up and served it for the evening meal.
The platoon commander, making his
evening round at mealtime, as usual,
stopped at the first man who had just
sat down with his steaming mess tin.
“Any complaints?” asked the platoon
commander as the unfortunate man
brought a spoonful up to his lips. “Horse
manure!” yelled the man spitting it out
—“but,” he added hastily, “beautifully
cooked beautifully cooked.”
Which brings me to books with themes
like “Lolita”. Beautifully written, beauti-
fully written.

THE SYLLABUS
Sir,
Christians in general no doubt are
bewildered by the storm of abuse and
criticism emanating from clerical and
other sources in the present controversy
over the NSW religious syllabus. Most,
probably, wonder what it is all about;
so perhaps the views of three great con-
temporary churchmen may shed some
light on the necessity for giving our
children a little knowledge of other
religious systems than their own.
Dr Barnes, Bishop of Birmingham,
wrote in his scholarly work, “The Rise
of Christianity”, in speaking of the
ancient religion of Mithra, “When all
that is to its disfavor has been said we
must remember that it encouraged brave
and resolute action alike on the field of
battle and in the struggle against evil.
Furthermore, like Christianity, it satis-
fied man’s desire for immortality and pro-
mised final justice for the unfortunate
and oppressed.” He further notes that
the likenesses between Mithraism and
Christianity as each had developed by
the end of the second century of our era
were many. Each faith had borrowed
from the other and the borrowings of
Christianity were perhaps the more
extensive!
The Very Rev. Dr George McLeod in
his book, “Only One Way Left”, speak-
ing of written prayers, asks, “Why do
they go dead on us?” He answers: “Be-
cause most of them are conceived in
medieval terms, we are not really con-
ditioned to read what they are really
saying. For medieval man, life was
dull, brutish and short. We moderns are
of a different expectancy to medieval

A better
way to
hunt bargains
in Hong Kong
Fifty of Hong Kong's shops have
branches right in the air-
conditioned arcade of the
Hongkong Hilton. Make it your
base and you’ll get all of the
savings and none of the
exhaustion of free-port bargain-
hunting. And you’ll relax in the
hotel’s 80-foot outdoor
swimming pool; cruise the
harbour on the hotel’s own
brigantine; live it up in its 25th
floor Eagle’s Nest Supper Club.
i
You’ll find a fascinating blend
of East and West at the
Hongkong Hilton. The Grill
is staunchly American,
the Jade Lotus Room richly
oriental. And the food in
each is perfect of its kind.
The Hongkong Hilton is right
at the heart of Hong Kong’s
major business, governmental
and entertainment section
a ten-minute ferry ride from
Kowloon.
For reservations, see your travel
agent, or call these special
reservation numbers:' in

man. Life is not brutish or short. We
are girt about with possibilities. If
medieval man looked up through a
telescope, we rather look down through
a microscope ... If his fears were ghosts
in the Leavenlies, ours are in the infini-
tesimal but infernal and paradoxically in-
finite possibilities of hydrogen.”
The Bishop of Woolwich says in his
book, “Honest to God”: “Church people
continue to explain the atonement in
some such terms as this, picturing the
interplay of two personified parties. The
relationship between God and Man has
been broken by original sin. Man could
not pull himself up by his own shoe-
strings. and thus the only hope of restora-
tion was God's side. Yet it was from
our side that things had to be put right.
It appeared hopeless. But God found
the answer. For in Christ He Himself
became man and as man reconciled us
to Himself.
“This construction no doubt gives ex-
pression or projection to genuine and
deep-seated realities in the existential
situation and as myth should not be
thrown out. But as an objective trans-
action supposed to have been accom-
plished outside us in time and soace. it
speaks today to remarkably few —to
fewer indeed than the Christmas myth.
Both require more demythologising even
than the Resurrection story.”
The question must surely arise as to
whether our -clergy who regularly in-
struct our children are sufficiently Quali-
fied to nresent the facts of Christianity
rather than over-emphasising the impor-
tance of its ancient myths and supersti-
tions.
J. PERKIN
Sydney (NSW).
Sir.
Buddhism is reputed to be a gentle,
forbearing religion. Christianity pur-
ports to be one of peace and brotherly
love. Yet. as I write, Christians are
busily chopping Buddhists to pieces in
Saigon, and Buddhists are slaughtering
Christians with equal fervor.
Let us face it honestly: religion—
Christianity. Islam and Buddhism-—has
been the cause in the last 2000 years
of more savage “holy” wars, massacres,
tortures and burnings alive than any
factor in historv.
Good luck to Mr Wetherell. But it
mieht be a good idea to abandon en-
tirely all religious and scriptural teach-
ings in the schools and to substitute
courses of elementary ethics.
KEVIN J. O'NEILL
Sydney (NSW).
Sir,
Your “Plain English” on the new
NSW syllabus for general religious
teaching (29/8/64) must have warmed
the hearts of all people with thoughts
of tolerance and values. The opposition
to Mr Wetherell has left me with a
sense of shame and despair.
It has reminded me of Mahatma
Gandhi’s early quarrel with the “white”
governments of the African continent
“for feeding prejudice by legalising it”.
Why should he go to Heaven and attain
salvation only as a Christian, asked
Gandhi of those who would convert him,
Did Christianity have a monopoly of
Heaven? Was God a Christian? Did
He have prejudices against non-
Christians?
Truly, fanaticism consists of re-
doubling our efforts when we have for- 1
gotten our aims.

UNDERGRADUATE “NIHILISM”
Sir,
May I as someone who, from 1958 to
1963, held considerable editorial and
literary responsibility as a student at
the University of Melbourne, comment’
on the letters of Vincent Buckley
(8/8/64) and Neville Langdon (22/8/64)
concerning undergraduate nihilism in
Australian universities?
I should like to say first that I found
Mr Buckley one of the five or six out-
standing teachers whom I had the pri-
vilege to meet and learn from at the''
University. He was one of that incred-
ibly small number of people who in their
formal and informal activities seemed to
be engaged in living out the true ideals'
of a university. And because of his de-
votion to his vocation as a university
teacher, he was able to achieve a magni-
ficent critical understanding of the con-
ditions of life in his university.
His statement that “over the past three)
years we have had some quite unusual'
examples of undergraduate nihilism from/
people in positions of responsibility” is
no more than the exact truth. The
occasion in 1962 in which Dr Frank
Knopfelmacher was subjected to the'
most cowardly and contemptible charac-,
ter assassination in the university news-
paper “Farrago” stands out as an un-'
avoidable example during a particularly 1
vicious series of editions. >
If Mr Langdon were in the least in-
formed about Mr Buckley, he would
know that Mr Buckley condemns his
own generation even more than the,.,
students’ generation, and that he is'
acutely and painfully aware of his own
inevitable shortcomings and human im-
perfection. t
It may or may not be possible to avoid!
the “maniacal holocaust” of which Mil
Langdon so glibly speaks, but if useful
effort is still to be made, it will
about through the maturity and humility
of Mr Buckley, not through the adoles-j
cent and sententious arrogance of Mrj
Langdon.

Minutes ago this coil of

fashioned into a gleaming strip
550 feet long and a quarter-inch
thick by Comalco’s new £1.7
million hot mill the largest
aluminium rolling mill in
Australia. This mill at Yennora
(N.S.W.) has the speed and

iTow would you describe a label which could
be manufactured in paper, foil, acetate or
cloth, and which could be applied to any clean
smooth surface without using heat, moisture,
gum or glue? And supposing the label could
be of two types: Permanent or Removable.
Then toss in a two-year guarantee, plus the
fact that these labels could be produced in any
shape and size. What would you have? What
would you call it?
No doubt, you’d say that this was quite a
label . . something that could help trim-
production costs . . . something that could be
used in 'all fields of manufacturing and
retailing.
These labels are in existence today. As a matter
of fact, they’ve been used in industry since
1935. And each day over five million Avery*
self-adhesive labels are used throughout the
world.

“BARLEY CHARLIE”
Sir,
Frank Roberts asks (22/8/64) what,
agreement this Guild negotiated with)
GTV concerning the series “Barley
Charlie”. Following recent publicity
concerning lack of scripts for the series,
the Guild did open negotiations with!
GTV; as a result a Melbourne writer
was commissioned to write a script,
which has now been written and
accepted. >
It would be improper to set out here
details of all the matters discussed with
GTV, as the Guild does not make a
practice of making public announce-
ments about matters still under negotia-
tion. However, it would seem from our
talks with GTV that a new series of
“Barley Charlie” is imminent and that/
the bulk of the scripts will be locally
written.

THE NEW GUINEANS
Sir, I
Your correspondent's interview with
Mr Eric Thomas in “One Way Ticket]
from New Guinea” (11/7/64) depicts
a narrow view. Many Europeans in this
Territory are achieving wonderful results'
in their efforts to educate the nativei
people. The Papuans and New Guineans);
are no longer regarded as merely cheap i
labor. With patience and understanding;
much has been done.
The results over the past decade are
astonishing. The old school of Euro-
peans who maintain that “you can’t teach 1
these natives, we know better” are con- 1
stantly being proved wrong. There arei
now university students, police officers,j
and many others, including the Terri-/
tory’s first pilot. '
Unfortunately a few Europeans refuse/
to face up to the changes. They are|
fighting a last-ditch stand, and the cries (
of murder, rape and chaos are manifes-
tations of their negative attitude. Hap-?
pily, the gentleman who entertained
friend of mine to dinner and, after a
meal superbly cooked and served by(
his domestic servant, punched him in the
face because he was a little slow in re-
moving a jug from the table, is
common nowadays.

Landing aids for modern aircraft and
the radar systems which “see” for them
have their nerve systems printed in copper.
Printed circuits demonstrate the outstand-
ing electrical conductivity of copper . , .
connecting “ribbons” of thicknesses down
to .0015 of an inch can be used to carry
considerable current without heat problems.
This is only one of many applications of copper in the air-
craft industry. For example, this giant Boeing carries almost
five miles of copper electrical wiring in a variety of gauges.
Because of copper’s unique qualities, it is closely associated
with a multitude of new techniques in the whole field of
electronics.

National Notebook
Going Down Like Tenpins
We went along the other night to
wine and dine with Dan Mitseff and
Bud Fisher who have been in Australia
briefly to (excuse our pun) get the ball
rolling on what promises to be a spec-
tacular sporting promotion.
Mr Mitseff is an amiable, handsome
man who comes quickly to the point.
“Professional 10-pin bowling is in its
infancy here in Australia. But back
home in the US we have 900 members
of the Professional Bowlers’ Association
and it is big, big business. For example,
this year in 36 tournaments, the prize
money totals something like 1,100,000
dollars.”
Mr Mitseff, who is Director of Opera-
tions of the PBA, feels that once Aus-
tralians get used to the idea of 10-pin
bowling as a spectator sport, they will
be just as enthusiastic about attending
tournaments as they now are about pro-
fessional golf and tennis matches.
Publicity man Bud Fisher says that
they had never thought of coming out to
Australia until John Fitch, Australia’s
champ and founder of Australia’s PBA,
competed in the States last year for the
big prize money.
“John was wildly enthusiastic about
our set-up and felt sure his fellow
countrymen would go for a visit by the
US champs. After all, 10-pin bowling
in itself is no novelty . . . something in
excess of 2,000,000 Australians have
played a game during the last year.
“And with that kind of active
enthusiasm, it seemed certain they would
enjoy watching the world’s best in
action.”
How many bowlers are coming? We
wanted to know.
“Twelve of the greatest, including
names like Bill Allen, Buzz Fazio,
Carmen Salvino, Dick Weber and Ed
Bourdase,” said Mr Fisher, “and I have
a feeling that even though these are
familiar names only to 10-pin bowlers
here who take their game seriously,
they’ll soon be as familiar to the general
public as Gonzales in tennis and Arnold
Palmer in golf.”
The twelve US bowlers arrive in
Sydney on October 13 and will not only
play the Australian PBA Open Tourna-
ments in Melbourne and Sydney, but
W >ll give exhibition games in Brisbane
and Adelaide and conduct 10-pin bowl-
ing clinics in all four cities.
A Party From Omsk
have, we must confess, seldom
given thought to Omsk. Until we
e nt along to see the Omsk Siberian
Oncers, we were prepared to accept
our gazetteer’s description of it as
Tomsk's conversational companion, and
a caravan centre on the Irtish River
roughly in the middle of the Soviet
Union.
But stocky, urbane former newspaper-
man Yuri Yuroksy, director and founder
of the group, assured us urgently that
his native city is a dynamo of agricul-
tural, industrial and cultural activity
with an emphasis on the latter.
Speaking through an interpreter, he
told us he had specialised in folk lore
of the region and in 1950 organised
some talented singers and dancers into a
group which has grown and prospered
until today they show a tidy profit on
their year’s activities.
The profits are all ploughed back into
the company. “We buy new costumes,
train new people and cut admission
fees.”
Omsk music and dance, while Siberian
in nature, “reflects the beauty of our
city a true garden city with flowers
everywhere. I think our dances and
songs have acquired a lyric quality from
the beauty of the region.” It seems we
shall have to think more seriously about
Omsk in future.
Up a Gumtree
'C'very year at Melbourne’s Royal Show
The Royal Agricultural Society tries
to put on at least one arena act that's
different. This time they have brought
out Kelly Stanley, 29, of Cosmos, Wash-
ington, tree-climbing champion of the
world.
We have just met this man Stanley.
He is a slim, lithe, gentle character with
a real western accent. He says there is a
tree-climbing circuit around the shows
of the US, just like there’s a tennis cir-
cuit and a golf circuit.
“Maybe we don’t get prizes like
Arnold Palmer, but 15 of us do pretty
good. Regular top prize at a show is 500
dollars for first and 300 dollars for sec-
ond. Yeah, I hold the world record, up
and down a pole 107 feet high in 36
seconds.”
Kelly keeps fit by running two miles
every day. And to get up and down a
pole in that time it at least the equivalent
of a 10-mile run. That’s what an Ameri-
can doctor told him, anyway. He was in
the US Navy until he was 21 and learnt
tree-climbing as a rigger in the forests
of Washington.
He will have two Australian competi-
tors, Jack Swain, of Fumina South, Vic-
toria, and Jack Kelly, of Chelsea, Vic-
toria, men who have spent all their
lives timber-cutting.
Kelly Stanley is worried because the
Show Society is putting up a 90-foot pole
made of bluegum. Stanley reckons he
“ain’t never climbed a hardwood tree
before. Always worked on softwood fir
trees. Spikes sink into ’em easier.”
Whether Kelly Stanley can condition
himself to this problem will be a mite
clearer come September 24, Peoples’
Day, when they put on the World Title
Tree-Climbing Bout.
A Vaucluse Phenomenon
YUe met something of a literary pheno-
menon the other day in the person
of Frank Kenyon, who is now working
on his fifteenth novel in his large and
comfortable home in Vaucluse, Sydney.
Like the gentleman in the television com-
mercial, Kenyon has discovered a good
thing and stuck to it. His books are his-
torical fiction, in his subjects he has bias
towards the frailer sex (books about
Emma Hamilton, Nell Gwynne, the Em-
presses Josephine and Eugenie have been
among his best-sellers), and his novels
have been translated into more than a
dozen languages, including Finnish, Tur-
kish and Japanese. The Josephine book
won aUS Literary Guild selection and
sold more than a million copies in Ameri-
ca. Emma Hamilton also received the
guerdon of an American book club selec-
tion. Among Australian writers Kenyon
seems to be unique in ploughing this
profitable and inexhaustible field of
period romance.
Born in Lancashire 52 years ago, Ken-
yon went to New Zealand as a boy and
settled in Sydney in 1954. “I could live
anywhere where there is a decent re-
ference library, but I like the Sydney
climate”, he says. In his early twenties
he lived in London for two years, trying
unsuccessfully to break into the world of
authorship. Back in New Zealand he be-
gan writing radio plays, short stories and
freelance book reviews. He sold radio
scripts in New Zealand, Australia, Cana-
da and South Africa, but his first real
break came in 1940 when an Australian
commercial network bought a serial
based on the life of the Empress Jose-
phine. It uncoiled itself through 156
quarter-hour episodes and Kenyon fol-


lowed it with 26 hours about King James
II and another marathon devoted to
Charles 1 and Oliver Cromwell. Those
were the palmy days of radio serials,
and Kenyon's casts provided employ-
ment for such well-known actors and
actressess as Walter Sullivan, Leonard
Thiele, Athol Fleming, Nigel Lovell,
Muriel Steinbeck, Diana Perryman and
Neva Carr-Glynn.
“I really wanted to write plays but the
success of the soap operas started me
on historical fiction”, Kenyon told us.
“When I had saved enough money I took
time off to turn the Josephine serial into
a novel. Hutchinsons published it in
1952, and I was lucky enough to get an
American book club selection which got
me off to a flying start. Josephine has
now appeared in 14 languages, including
a pirated edition in Turkey. Since then
I’ve been writing at the rate of about
one book a year.”
Kenyon says that at least two-thirds
of his income comes from America.
“Apart from the book club selections my
books sell about 10,000 copies in Ameri-
ca, compared with not more than 5000
in England,” he says. “In fact, French
translations have done much better than
some of the English editions. Marie
Antoinette went into two printings in
France, more than 20,000 copies alto-
gether. It later appeared in Japanese and
I heard that a Tokyo company was think-
ing of making a film version, but it
doesn't seem to have come to anything.
A Japanese Versailles would have been
worth seeing ”
Kenyon has also had a film nibble
from France for the Empress Josephine,
and his American agent is investigating
prospects for a musical comedy based on
the Nell Gwynne book. Kenyon describes
the market for historical fiction as
“steady but not spectacular”. His four-
teenth novel, concerning the life of
George Sand, is due for publication in
America next month.
Out Of The Darkness
T ed to the “hot seat” at Sydney's air-
port TV room, Ray Charles was
obviously nervous and fatigued. He sat
hunched on the chair almost anony-
mous in dark glasses. “I guess I was in-
fluenced by people Nat King Cole
and Charles Brown certainly,” the great
singer said. “But 1 think I quickly be-
came myself. When I take a song I get
some feeling myself out of it. I have
to have that. I only sing what I person-
ally have a feeling for. If I don’t feel it
the audience certainly won't.
“I’ve just come from the Far East. I
played night clubs, small places and big
halls. I like the big concerts best. Bio
audiences react better.”
No “loner,” he travels on this tour,
which began last May, with a company
of 26. “I used to work alone, but 1 find
I work better with a group.
“What would I like to do most? I’d
like to help young artists develop. 1 feel
young talent needs help along the way
from those of us who have made it.
“Yes, of course I have strong feeling
about the racial issue in the US. I’m
involved. I don’t get up and talk about
it. I’m not good at speaking. But I help
ether ways. I contribute what 1 can to
the causes I believe in.”
Earlier this year, Charles completed a
film in Britain. “This concerned a young
lad who lost his sight. He has a dominat-
ing— no, not exactly dominating, let's
say overprotective mother. My role is to
show her that because a boy has lost his
sight he hasn't necessarily lost his mind,”

PLAIN ENGLISH
Malaysia and Survival
tPhe Indonesian paradrop in cen-
A tral Malaya last Thursday raises
two problems Malaysian re-
sponse and Indonesian intent. In so
far as response goes, the Tunku
acted sensibly in declaring a state
of emergency and in making an im-
mediate appeal to the UN an
appeal which might have been made
earlier but which clearly reveals
Indonesian aggression to the world
and in particular to the Afro-Asian
powers who cannot regard it with-
out concern. Just what further
Malaysian response is required at
the moment, other than military pre-
paredness, depends very much on
Indonesian intent which is hard to
gauge. It is still improbable, des-
pite the rashness of last week’s para-
drop, that Indonesia seeks a full-
scale war which it would lose, des-
pite Russian military aid, and which
could only bring about the frag-
mentation feared by Indonesians of
all political persuasions.
Therefore the easy comparison or
Indonesia’s West New Guinea
strategy with the Malaysia strategy
carries only part of the way. While
the tactics of probing with threats
of a greater use of force to come
are the same in both cases, Malaysia
is still not West New Guinea. The
prime factor in the West New
Guinea takeover was that not a
single Asian country supported
Dutch colonialism and for that
reason Britain and America de-
serted the Netherlands. Malaysia
is at least accepted as an Asian
country by its Asian neighbors,
and it has great and powerful
friends in both Britain and America
who are prepared to come to its
aid. These facts can scarcely escape
even the self-hypnotised politicians
in Djakarta who, however obsessed
with the ritualistic dances of the
political parties or with the necessity
for “solidarity-making” which Con-
frontation affords, are not likely to
be unware of the dangers of an all-
out war with Malaysia.
Confrontation is very much Pre-
sident Soekarno’s personal war from
which he gains dangerous but neces-
sary advantages. He is also per-
fectly aware that Malaysia is a
precariously structured new country
committed to parliamentary demo-
cracy and delicately balanced be-
tween two races on whose amity
and capacity to get along the
ultimate success of Malaysia rests.
If that racial harmony is destroyed,
so is Malaysia. It is not without
significance that the Indonesian
paradrop took place after new
Singapore riots and exactly one
week before the annual general
assembly of the United Malays
National Organisation which started
yesterday and at which delegates
will consider resolutions directly or
indirectly dealing with communal
problems in Malaysia.
They range from a request to the
Government to buy land and re-
distribute it to the Malays to another
which asks the Government to “re-
view” Malaysia’s diplomatic rela-
tions with Israel. They are frankly
communal. Djakarta knows full
well the strains and stresses to
which Malaysia is being subjected
both economically and socially by
confrontation stresses which can
only be withstood by communal
harmony and goodwill. Whether
communal harmony can be main-
tained depends entirely on the
Tunku. It will be his uncompromis-
ing insistence that all Malaysians
are citizens regardless of creed or
race which in the end will ensure
Malaysia’s survival against Indo-
nesian aggression.
The “Peace” Game
T ast week’s statement on the
forthcoming Sydney “Peace
Congress” by Federal Attorney-
General, Mr B. M. Snedden, was
nonetheless welcome for being
elementary in content. He pointed
out that the “Peace Congress”
would be a Communist-front for
the promotion of the Soviet Union’s
policies on such issues as Malaysia,
South Vietnam, the Exmouth Gulf
Base, and nuclear-free zones. This
may seem too obvious to be worth
an Attorney-General’s time in say-
ing it, but the alarming thing is the
number—small but not insignificant
—of public figures who have agreed
to sponsor this ramp. Dr J. F.
Cairns, of the Federal Parlia-
mentary Labor Party, for example,
even made the cynical remark that
the Congress will be “an oppor-
tunity for free and rewarding dis-
cussion”—as if any organisation
controlled by Communists will per-
mit “free and rewarding dis-
cussion”.
But Dr Cairns is not alone.
Thirty-one Labor Parliamentarians
are among the Congress’s sponsors,
including four Labor members of
the Federal Parliament E. J.
Harrison (MHR for Blaxland),
A. W. James (Hunter), L. R.
Johnson (Hughes), T. Uren (Reid);
and seven Labor members of the
NSW Parliament —T. W. Dalton
(Sutherland), C. J. Earle (Bass Hill),
L. J. Ferguson (Merrylands), J. P.
Flaherty (Granville), H. E. Jack-
son (Gosford), T. I. Morey (Bligh)
and W. M. Rigby (Hurstville).
When people of this public status
are prepared to sponsor a Com-
munist front, it would not be sur-
prising if some hundreds of gullible
people—seriously concerned, as is
everybody, with the need to pre-
serve peace—are persuaded to turn
up and be subjected to Soviet
propaganda in the guise of respect-
able pacifism.
This time, admittedly, the Sino-
Soviet split will obtrude, and the
Peking Communists will try them-
selves to expose the Congress as a
tool of Moscow when they want it
to be a tool of Peking. But this
sort of gang-warfare merely under-
lines the cynicism with which the
whole affair is being conducted. If
Mr Snedden’s speech does no more
than lead a few of the less naive
participants to think twice, it will
have been worth making.


THIS AUSTRALIA
THE ALP
Barry Jones and the
“Toothless Tiger”
The purge that failed
FROM A MELBOURNE CORRESPONDENT
BARRY JONES
" McCarthyism?”
TTow long will the Victorian Branch
of the ALP go on blowing its
brains out? Over the years the Victorian
Executive has shown extraordinary zeal
in disciplining young members, often
students and junior University staff
members, who have committed the
heresy of suggesting that the ALP is less
than 100 per cent perfect. There has
been a series of episodes in which the
Executive has gravely examined views
set out in learned journals, seminars and
summer schools and called their authors
to account.
Last week the Executive moved in
against two such intellectual heretics
Messrs Barry Jones (the quiz king) and
Peter Samuel (a Monash University
economist). No less than six of its mem-
bers —Messrs Hartley, the State Sec-
retary, Nolan, Brown, Innes, Butler and
Mrs Doris Condon —attended a special
meeting of the Ripponlea branch in the
hope of seeing Mr Jones expelled.
His expulsion had been demanded by
a member of the Malvern branch, Mr
Brian Zouch, a journalist employed on a
suburban newspaper. In a seven-page
document submitted to the Executive,
Mr Zouch charged Jones with disloyal
conduct, with showing sympathy for the
views of Mr B. A. Santamaria, with
McCarthyism and with generally being
an undesirable reactionary.
Even Mr Zouch has conceded that
his charges were not set out in very
coherent form. As much as they had any
basis, they were derived from a docu-
ment which Mr Jones had privately cir-
culated within the ALP earlier this year,
analysing what he saw as the reasons for
the Party’s dismal performances at the
polls. It was in this survey that he re-
ferred to the ALP as “a toothless tiger”,
a phrase highly offensive to the proud
militants of the Party’s Executive.
The Executive backed Mr Zouch to
the point of having the charges heard by
the Ripponlea branch to which Mr Jones
belongs. However, even in the intimida-
tory presence of six Executive members,
the 30 branch members rejected the
charges and reaffirmed confidence in
Jones.
The matter may not rest there. The
Executive itself may consider and act on
the Zouch allegations. This might mean
an open breach with the Ripponlea
branch, one of the most active in the
ALP’s decaying suburban structure; but
that would not necessarily inhibit the
Executive.
Mr Samuel’s case had not been heard
by the Executive when this issue went to
press. Earlier this year the ALP paper
“Fact” published an attack on a pamph-
let which had made a critical analysis
of the ANZ Peace Congress. Mr Samuel,
who had been associated with the pub-
lication of the pamphlet, submitted a
reply to “Fact”. This was not published,
so Mr Samuel had his letter duplicated
and personally distributed it to delegates
at the last State conference.
Whether Mr Jones and Mr Samuel
were perceptive, balanced, fair or unfair
in their criticisms is beside the point. The
fact is that these and earlier incidents are
creating the impression that the Victorian
ALP leaders are boorishly and irrevoc-
ably reactionary.
The past week has seen the Victorian
State Executive busy in two other depart-
ments: smoothing down its President,
Mr Bob Holt, who walked out of an
Executive meeting and refused to return,
unless they adopted his proposal to deal
with the latest Unity Ticket in the Water-
side Workers’ Union; and licking its
\\ounds, after a disastrous failure to un-
seat two other rebels, Councillors Tom
Gilhooley and A. .Oakley, at the recent
municipal elections.
Holt’s walk-out came when his plan
for a face-saving inquiry into the Whar-
fies’ Unity Ticket to comply with under-
takings given to the ALP Federal Execu-
tive was defeated and the Victorian
Executive decided on “no action.” Holt
has now lodged a formal appeal with the
ALP Federal Executive.
Melbourne Trades Hall opinion is that
Holt has no desire to roll Unity Ticketers’
heads, but he believes a show of investi-
gation must be made to satisfy Federal
opinion, and particularly NSW President
C. Oliver, whom he is cultivating. There
is talk of a deal by which NSW and
Victoria will agree and let each other
settle its own vexed issues in its own way
like Unity Tickets in Victoria and aid for
denominational schools in NSW to suit
their local conditions.
The rebel councillors, Tom Gilhooley
and Oakley, humiliatingly defeated ALP
candidates in the Oakleigh Municipal
elections. Gilhooley was expelled and
Oakley was allowed to resign, following
their action in voting to include Catholic
schools in scholarships granted by their
municipality. The ALP went after them
at the recent election, but they won easily
in an area of strong Labor sympathies.
And so the Victorian Labor farce
stumbles on from absurdity to absurdity.
LAW
The End of the
Herring Era
Age of Reform - with some anomalies left
FROM SAM LIPSKI IN MELBOURNE
SIR E. HERRING
“Exacting”
Tn a tribute to his predecessor, Victoria’s
new Chief Justice, Sir Henry Winneke,
described Sir Edmund Herring’s term of
office as the “most exacting term of
all”. Now retiring after 20 years in of-
fice (and the first Chief Justice to retire
at the compulsory age of 72) Sir Ed-
mund's most outstanding achievement in
a career marked for its distinction was
the establishment of the Chief Justice's
Law Reform Committee.
Judges, barristers and solicitors are


members of the Committee which advises
an d co-operates with State Parliament in
the framing of legislation. Unique to
Victoria in Australia, it is modelled on
similar bodies in Britain.
It has helped to remove anomalies,
although Sir Edmund feels there are still
some difficult ones to tackle. One which
concerns him is the relationship between
man and wife under the Common Law
in certain circumstances. “If a man is
driving along on a motor cycle with his
wife on the pillion seat and his wife is
injured, she cannot recover or sue him.
If it his mistress, she can.”
What about the anomalies in law be-
tween the States? Was it right that a
man’s life should depend on which State
tried him? “I think it is very unfortun-
ate. But the great function of govern-
ment is to maintain law and order. You
know, I’m a bit concerned about the
victim in this discussion about capital
punishment. I feel we are forgetting
about the victim and concentrating on
the feelings of the criminal.”
Did this mean that he was in favor
of capital punishment? “Personally I
would retain it on the statute books. I
am worried about the terrible problem
of women not being able to go out at
night on their own, for instance. We seem
to be running away from punishing
people.”
Sir Edmund said his aim had always
been to “deal justly”. He was, he thought,
as soft as most. At the same time he
thought that the evidence favored disci-
pline in dealing with offenders.
But this was criminal law. Except for
capital crimes most of Sir Edmund’s
years on the Supreme Court Bench had
been concerned with civil law. During
his term he had seen some encouraging
signs of progress. “Parliament is very
good in this State. I’m also proud of the
legal profession which on the whole is
of a very good standard.” The setting up
of a Legal Aid bureau was an example.
And what does a Chief Justice do in
retirement? For Sir Edmund there will
be more time for golf and his special
interest, the Inter-Church Trade and
Industry Mission which he says is doing
a “fantastic” job in making Christianity
meaningful to the man on the job.
There are other interests the
National War Memorial, the Shrine of
Remembrance, the British and Foreign
Bible Society, the Boy Scouts Movement,
Trinity College School Council. All evid-
dence of a “second career” which Sir Ed-
mund now hopes to begin.
THE ECONOMICS
Our Trade Alliance
with Japan
Something will have to give
FROM J. C. HORSFALL IN MELBOURNE
T. ADACHI
A lesson
|n Canberra last week Australian and
Japanese businessmen were looking
squarely at the yawning trade gap be-
tween our two countries (and Mr J.
McEwen was heaping more praise on
the trade treaty he negotiated last year
which was supposed to help redress the
balance) while down in Melbourne the
various foreign owners of the Australian
motor industry were battling before the
Tariff Board to stop another foreigner
~~ also Japan swamping their Aus-
tralian markets.
Toe issues at stake involved one of
the first lessons in economics, put suc-
cinctly by Paul A. Sammuelson, leading
American professor, as: “What is pru-
jknt behavior for an individual or single
business firm may at times be folly for
a nation or state”.
On the broader national plane, both
Mr McEwen and Mr T. Adachi, presi-
dent of the Australia-Japan Business Co-
operation Committee, preferred to talk
around rather than at the point which
is that our balance of visible trade with
Japan is now more favorable than ever.
Last year's lift to £16.3m. in our imports
from Japan (largely stemming from tex-
tiles, chemicals and motors) was a drop
in the ocean compared with the rise of
£71.2m. to £244.3m. in our exports
(mainly wool, grains and minerals) to
Japan. In consequence the balance
stretched from £108.4m. to £ 143.2 m. in
our favor.
Despite McEwen's insistence that Aus-
tralian manufacturing industry must be
protected to provide employment for an
expanding population; that we “in total
have bought more than we have sold
abroad for as far back as I can think”;
and that Japanese and any other ex-
porters to Australia can argue their cases
without fear or favor before the Tariff
Board, something will have to give to
get a more even balance of trade with
Japan. That can only mean taking more
imports, because Japan is McEwen’s
white hope for further increasing our
exports.
In his turn and without nailing any
particular Japanese product to our mast,
Mr Adachi read us a lesson in the libe-
ralisation of trade. He pointed to Japan’s
strides in the liberalisation of its imports
in the last four years from 42 to 93
p.c. of its total import trade and the
adoption of, in effect, a full-scale open-
door system. This meant exposing its
industries to the full blast of internation-
al competition, but it also meant that
Japan could not achieve and maintain
a balance on its overseas accounts with-
out what he called a “satisfactory” in-
crease in exports. No doubt a little dis-
appointed with the effect of Japan’s trade
treaty with us to date, Mr Adachi want-
ed to confer more on non-Government
levels to remove discriminatory treat-
ment and other barriers to the expansion
of its exports.
Meanwhile, if Australian motor mak-
ers and assemblers get their way with
the Tariff Board in an application to
have the duty on fully imported vehicles
put at least double that of vehicles as-
sembled in Australia, the promising drive
of the Japanese into our vehicles market
(which has taken its share up to three
p.c. and is aiming at 8 p.c.) is likely
to be arrested.
However, importers of Japanese cars
are putting up a good fight. The Aus-
tralian representative of the Nissan
Motor Co., Mr L. J. Harnet, told the
board the present rates of duty could
be reduced. He submitted that the most
economic and efficient Australian manu-
facturer did not require protection at
the existing level against imports from
Japan which were not sold at a lower
price than equivalent locally produced
vehicles, and that duties applying to
components, which local producers
want adopted to cover imported vehicles,
have no bearing on the matter.
He also threw in a point which Mr H.
E. Holt, as well as the Minister for
Trade, might find telling, when he said
that “the expansion of our exports and
domestic markets for all goods will pro-
vide greater and ensure more benefits to
the economy of Australia than are likely
to arise from the inflationary effect of
an increase in the current duties under
the Most Favoured Nation tariff”. This
is rare common ground for Treasury and
Trade.


WEALTH
Australia’s Low Standard of Living
Compared with Sweden, Switzerland and Kuwait
FROM J. C. HORSFALL IN MELBOURNE
A ccording to “the Financial Times”
(London), Australians are not as
affluent as they think —not as well off
as the people of Sweden, Luxembourg
or Switzerland, and only eighth on the
world list of rich countries.
The journal admits, however, that its
estimates of “wealth” arrived at by
dividing Gross National Product, ex-
pressed in United States dollars, by the
number of inhabitants are only a rough
guide.
As a matter of fact after doing the
sums myself, if this is any satisfaction, I
find we are just a shade better off than
the Luxembourgers, but there isn’t much
in it, and the difference depends on how
up to date one’s figures are. Our GNP
has been forging ahead much more
rapidly than population here; actually
more than four times as fast in the last
year, while Luxembourg, with only
322,000 against our 11 1/4 million
people, has been rather dragging its feet
of late on both counts.
However, and this applies to all seven
countries above us on the list, it is signi-
ficant that although its GNP is far lower
than ours, little Luxembourg has more
foreign trade than we have. In its case,
for instance, imports are about twice as
high (5.7 billion US dollars against our
2.9 billion). Others like Sweden (fifth)
and Switzerland (sixth) get a pull on us,
not only because of their bigger foreign
trade but also from their smaller popula-
tions (Sweden 7.6 and Switzerland 5.7
million), On the latest figures their
GPN’s are somewhat lower —-Sweden's
about a quarter less, and Switzerland's
about a third less.
It is no surprise that the immense oil
output in Kuwait with a population of
only 322,000, and Qatar with even less,
45,000, put these oil Sheikdoms first and
second on the list, even above the USA
which has to share its GNP among up-
wards of 190 million inhabitants. Nor is
it remarkable that Britain with a GNP
of only 84 billion dollars (against 608
billion for the US) and its population of
533 million is w ; ay dow'n the list in
fifteenth place, just below Western Ger-
many and 'France, who with populations
of 553 and 48 million respectively, also
have to share their GNP rather thinly,
THE HANGMEN
feulLetCn
September 13, 1884
There are already over a dozen ap-
plicants for Upjohn’s position as
Victorian hangman. Gately, by the
way, who was Upjohn's predecessor,
was more of an animal than a human
being. His face was a ghastly knot,
typical of every phase of crime.
His forehead was narrow and reced-
ing, and his small green eyes were
sunk in positive caverns. And his
yawning chasm of a mouth displayed
only two or three broken and black-
ened fangs. During twelve years,
Gately had only once been four con-
secutive weeks at liberty. When he
had, as a rule, been ornamenting the
city with his presence more than a
week the police would send emissaries
armed with Little Bourke Street grog
to make him drunk, and then the
burly giant would lose all remaining
human instincts, and run amuck
through the city, bombarded with
road-metal by the larrikins, until mad
with pain and rage, he would hammer
with his fist against the gaol gates,
and apply, with curses, for admission.
The Adelaide hangman is a different
type of civil servant. He is a tall,
dark, dirty, old gentleman. He can go
out as he chooses, but he seldom
avails himself of his promenade priv-
ileges, since his appearance in King
William Street drives the larrikin ele-
ment to the pitch of frenzy. The SA
executioner is moderate in his pota-
tions, except those times immediately
preceding or succeeding a hanging.
His favorite author is Ainsworth.
ON THE LAND
Why Labor May Lose Broken Hill
Henry Lawson will have to dream again
FROM A BROKEN HILL CORRESPONDENT
Tf feeling in the Labor stronghold of
Broken Hill is any pointer to the
outcome of the forthcoming NSW elec-
tions, the Labor Government may be
out of power next year.
Hottest of several local issues is the
State Government's blunt rejection last
week of plans to develop irrigation dairy-
farming at Menindee, where in 1960 the
giant Menindee Lakes Scheme was estab-
lished. While the Premier, Mr J. B. Ren-
shaw, referred directly only to commun-
ity dairy-farming, his pronouncement has
been interpreted as the scrapping of all
plans for full-scale irrigation develop-
ment. Mr Renshaw says his Minister for
Agriculture, Mr Enticknap, has found by
laboratory tests that the soil is unsuit-
able.
Only recently, a Government com-
mittee, the Menindee Lakes and Lower
Darling Resources Committee, had
recommended the dairying scheme, as
well as other development. The Govern-
ment’s contention covers the whole Men-
indee district, whereas it is only known
to have investigated several pockets of
land. Moreover, the CSIRO in a recent
document on cotton-growing said that
the NSW Government had never made a
broad land survey in the Menindee area,
describing it as ‘'the most urgent need in
the State.”
Mr Renshaw’s statement was received
with “disgust and dismay” by the Menin-
dee Dairymen’s Association, the mem-
bers of which have expended £3OOO and
50,000 man-hours trying to convince the
Government of the need and feasibility
of developing Menindee. A spokesman
for these men, normally staunch ALP
and union men, said: “It must be realised
that a rejection of the dairying scheme
means that any further development at
Menindee will not take place”.
Development of irrigation at Menin-
dee, 70 miles east of Broken Hill, has
been advocated almost ever since the first
settlement in the region. Around the turn
of the century, Henry Lawson wrote:
l saw a vision in days gone by, and
would dream that dream again,
Of the days when the Darling shall
not back her billabongs up in vain.
There were reservoirs and grand can-
als where the sad, dry land had been.
And the glorious network of aqueducts
mid fields that were always green.
That dream, promulgated so often by
an untold number of experts and pat-
riots, is now rudely shattered and it
might well mean that the Menindee
Lakes, harnessing four times the amount
of water in Sydney Harbor and cover-
ing eight times the surface area, will N
left to stagnate.

IN THE REP
Financing the Peace Front
A battleground of Moscow v. Peking
DR J. F. CAIRNS
“Rewarding”
FROM A SYDNEY CORRESPONDENT
fpHE organisers of Sydney’s forthcoming
Communist-front Peace Congress
are budgeting for £24,200. (Sources:
Delegates’ fees, £7500: Loans, £4500;
Trade Unions, £2700; Special Dona-
tions, £2000; Sale of badges, £1000;
Collections from rallies, £2200; Peace
forces in South Australia, £500; Queens-
land, £750; Victoria, £2500; Western
Australia, £5O). The main expenditure
will be £6OOO for travelling expenses for
international visitors (notably Dr Linus
Pauling), and £3500 for wages.
No one really doubts that the money
will be collected, but the hard fact con-
fronting the organisers is that they are
not getting it from planned sources. So
the call has gone out again. Trade
Union journals (particularly those with
Communist officials) are exhorting their
members to weigh in. For example, the
latest issue of “The Boilermaker” says:
“The voluntary peace levy of our society
the Boilermakers ranks high in
importance this quarter. Brothers who
have not contributed are requested to
think again . .
Apart from long-suffering brothers
getting sick and tired of weighing in to
defray expenses of these gala Commun-
ist fronts, another reason for tardy
finance has been the formation of the
pro-Peking “Australian Peace Liaison
Committee”, officially launched in May
this year with the Rev. Victor James as
chairman, and Mrs Betty Little as Sec-
retary. The new group got in before
the Peace Congress Organisers with a
plea for finance. The gratifying response
to this plea meant less response to the
Congress plea.
Ted Hill, leader of the breakaway
pro-Peking Communist party, has is-
sued direct instructions to his party mem-
bers and sympathisers, his newspaper
“Vanguard” stating: “It is the job of all
genuine peace fighters to see that the
Peace Movement generally and the Aus-
tralian Peace Congress are not manipul-
ated into supporting the policies of Uni-
ted States Imperialism (i.e. the Soviet
Union)”. Increasing knowledge that
Congress will be a battleground between
the rival Communist parties has already
caused some sponsors to think twice,
although Dr J. F. Cairns still looks for-
ward to “rewarding” discussions.
Tasmania, however, is standing firm.
The amount budgeted for from this
source is: nil.
LAW
Wanted: National Arbitration
What can a dogman do?
FROM GORDON CHESTERMAN IN SYDNEY
T ast week the Full Bench of the Com-
monwealth Conciliation and Arbit-
ration Commission again referred to one
of the standard ways in which the arbit-
ration machinery can be misused—by
allowing parties to play one jurisdiction
off against another.
It was dealing with an appeal over a
typical demarcation dispute (over what
union should do what work). Last March
a Commissioner, Mr J. P. Horan, direc-
ted that ship painters and dockers —
and not shipwrights—should carry out
the work of crane-chasing or dogmen
and the positioning of shaft brackets at
ship-building yards. The Shipwrights’
Association and the “bosses”, the Metal
Trade Employers’ Association, appealed
to the Full Bench and argued that Mr
Horan had no jurisdiction to make the
orders. It had not raised this jurisdiction-
al point in its case before Mr Horan.
In its judgment the Bench (Sir Rich-
ard Kirby, Mr Justice Moore and Mr J.
J. McCreadie) ruled that Mr Horan had
dealt with an interstate industrial and
therefore did have jurisdiction, and then
went on to make its general complaint,
By the law, as it now stands, the
Federal Commission does not have the
jurisdiction to deal with any matter un-
less it is an interstate dispute. Otherwise
the State has exclusive jurisdiction. What
usually happens, however, is that two
unions become involved in a demarcation
dispute, and although both unions are
covered by awards, it is a dispute which
is outside both of them. Technically the
Federal Commission still has not the
power to deal with it, although the par-
ties allow a Commissioner to investigate.
Should his decision not suit one of the
parties, it falls back on the point that it

Quality all the way...
INTERNATIONAL TRUCKS
These million-mile highway haulers, sales leaders
in the heavy duty field in the U.S.A. and the latest
International trucks to be introduced to Australia,
have quality built into every part.
Individually, many International DCO-405 models
have been ‘around the clock’ time and again, and
are still going strong because they’re quality all
the way.
Every part is engineered for stamina. As continuing
research yields an improvement, it is field-tested
to meet the exacting demands and performance
standards set for International trucks, and imme-
diately put into production.
For eight years now, on America’s toughest routes,
International DCO Series’ record of achievement has
proved it to be the most suitable truck for Aus-
tralia's similar conditions . . . the ideal unit for
long distance interstate heavy haulage ... for any
transport job where the kind of reliability that rolls
up a million miles with minimum downtime counts
. . . the kind of reliability that has made Inter-
national the most trusted name in trucks.

HVa s never an interstate dispute anyway,
, an d the Commissioner had no jurisdic-
tion.
The whole matter boils down to the
1 differences in the Federal and State sys-
tems. Obviously one answer is to scrap
these differences and turn to a national
1 arbitration system. However, on six oc-
casions between 1911 and 1946, Com-
monwealth Governments have sought
approval by a referendum for an enlarge-
ment of the Commonwealth industrial
power. On all those occasions they have
failed.
So it seems that until such time as
changes are made in the industrial sys-
tem, parties will continue to ask for
a tribunal and later, if dissatisfied, com-
plain that the tribunal had no right to
hear the case.
SOUTH AUSTRALIA
Another New Country Party
Playford as Lord High Executioner?
FROM AN ADELAISE CORRSPONDWNT
After an absence of 32 years, a
Country Party has returned to the
South Australian political scene as it
did recently to the Tasmanian. At the
moment, the party is fully autonomous,
but hopes to gain affiliation with the
.Federal CP. The Federal party says the
new body will have to show a vote-
getting potential and solid following
before the matter can be considered.
,Observers believe it has little chance of
showing either.
The party was publicly launched at a
Press conference in Adelaide. Bespectac-
led, 68-year-old widower, Mr T. G.
Clark, a former dairy co-operative man-
ager who is chairman of the provisional
committee, said the party would contest
key seats at the next State elections, ex-
pected in March. Mr Clark, a man with
a colorful turn of phrase, said the party
would not attempt to “bung out Tom
Playford”. But, he said, “We want to
wake him up. He has been Lord High
■Executioner for too long, and his Gov-
ernment has become ossified in relation
to the help it is prepared to give country
people”.
The announcement of the formation
of the SA Country Party came in a news-
paper advertisement, which said primary
producers in SA produced 85 per cent
°f the State’s wealth, but had little in-
fluence on Government policy. Few
People could agree with this claim, parti-
cularly the Labor Opposition, which has
complained for years of the “top-heavy”
country representation.
The effect of the new party on State
politics cannot be judged at this early
s fage. The original SA Country Party
a nd the Liberal Federation joined forces
■j s the Liberal and Country League in
one, 1938, and has never lost an elec-
.lon * Could the new party cause a split
ln this long-lasting coalition? It is im-
probable, but at least some of Play-
ford’s men are worried. One LCL offi-
cial has inferred that the current Liberal
and Country troubles interstate are
behind the formation of the new party.
On the Federal level, the new party
has already caused embarrassment, and
it will conceivably throw more strain on
Country and Liberal party relations.
Mr Clark says the SA Country Party
has had many offers of support, but so
far he has refused to reveal the extent
of its following. At this stage, it is be-
lieved to be small. The first positive
indication of the party’s prospects will
come later this year, when it holds its
first convention.

Politician's Pay
FROM A HOBART CORRESPONDENT
T)° you mean that you thumb rides
around your electorate?” an as-
tonished member of Tasmania’s Parlia-
mentary Salaries Tribunal asked Mr
T. R. McDonald, a Labor member of
the House of Assembly.
McDonald: I coyer more ground by
thumbing than by any other means.
Mr McDonald, one of the seven mem-
bers for the 11,000-square-mile electorate
of Wilmot, was the first witness before
the tribunal.
He described to the chairman (Mr
Justice Sugerman, of the NSW Sup-
reme Court), Professor W. A. Townsley
(Professor of Political Science at the
University of Tasmania), and Mr G. F.
Sorell (Public Service Tribunal chair-
man) how, with a salary of £lB5O and
an electorate allowance of £875, he
could not afford to move around other-
wise. A former journalist and the father
of five children, McDonald pleaded for
a bigger electorate allowance.
C. K. Murphy, clerk of the House of
Assembly, supported claims for greater
allowances. Members, he said, were re-
"It's a germ warning tower, seeing there's more bacteria about than sharks."

luctant to serve on committees because
the £3 35.-a-day allowance did not meet
their expenses. Mr Murphy told the tri-
bunal that the House sat for 56 days in
1961, on 44 days in 1962 and on 59 days
last year. Members got their meals at the
House for six shillings and while there
could telephone at public expense. They
also enjoyed free transport on Govern-
ment trains and buses. (Few allow them-
selves the pleasure, preferring their own
or fellow members’ cars.)
“If I gave £1 to every appeal made to
me, I’d have nothing left out of my elec-
torate allowance,” said Franklin Liberal
T. G. Pearsall. “I am the vice-president
of a hundred football clubs.”
Liberal Leader W. A. Bethune agreed
with Pearsall’s claim that multiple elec-
torates made it necessary for every one
of the seven members to turn up at
minor functions, but he added: “It is
difficult to separate the expenses of serv-
ing electors from electioneering ex-
penses.” Electioneering really went on
all the time, the frank Mr Bethune ad-
mitted, and he added that he believed
that he probably gave only £75 a year
more in donations than he would have
given were he a private citizen. Salaries
were “reasonably high” and his allow-
ance as Opposition Leader was ade-

He said that he was not embarrassed by

ances) was adequate, and so were present
pensions, but he believed all Ministers
should be equally salaried, that higher
allowances should be paid to members of
committees, and that country members
especially should be more adequately
reimbursed for their expenditure,
Speaker J. L. Madden, Liberal MHA
Kevin Lyons, Messrs Foot, Fry and

MLC, were more coy. They gave their
evidence in camera,
Mr Justice Sugerman, now back in

RACING
The Year of Recovery
A boom this spring?
FROM “DISCUS” IN SYDNEY
TTorse racing was being dismissed not
so very long ago as a spectator sport
which had had its day. Attendances were
declining, racecourses were being closed
down, especially in Sydney, and a more
affluent population was becoming tired
of the meat pie and glass of beer, take
it or leave it amenities which accom-
panied the “sport of kings” for most
of us.
But 1964 has been the recovery year.
The amenities have been improved, in
some places a little, in others a good deal.
A few of the necessary “glamor” horses
appeared, and in the States with legalis-
ed off-course betting the racing clubs
have both increased their attendances
and gained from the TAB sharing.
In New South Wales the upsurge has
been particularly evident, because the
TAB is not functioning yet, but the
AJC’s rapid improvement of Warwick
Farm, and some advance spending by
provincial clubs, have convinced enough
people that racing is not all slumming.
Warwick Farm, about 20 miles from the
city’s heart, and comparable to Sandown
Park in Melbourne in that is has a motor
racing track to help pay its way, has at-
tracted recent crowds of 20,000 to meet-
ings which were more likely to have
drawn 10,000 on any of the near-city
tracks one or two years ago, when the
Jeremiahs seemed to have everything on
their side.
This year everything points to a boom
spring season. The perhaps momentary
failure of Eskimo Prince has encouraged
more entries for the Sydney spring meet-
ings, from other States and New Zealand.
And the Caulfield Cup chances, which
include horses and followings from all
over, are so numerous that last year’s
winner, Sometime, who must be a danger
irrespective of recent form, is well down
in the betting.
As to the Melbourne Cup, the man-
agement of Stadiums Ltd might note that
reserved seats will cost £5 on Cup Day,
and that for that price racing people
will be offered much more than a string
of second and third rate events leading
up to the main. Flemington, at Cup
time, is a pointer to what we can hope
racing will offer more generally as it
benefits from the off-course bonuses. Al-
ready Flemington has installed more
stands, invested more in amenities, pro-
vided more garden settings, and gone for
a little glamor with its Fashions on the
Field parades and prizes worth £12,000.
This is not merely an example of
racing’s success in winning public
favor. It isn’t all the result of TAB
money. It is the result of good planning
by men who realise that the old, sweaty
days of sport are going, because spec-
tator sport is for men and women now.
Other sports, amateur and professional,
can ignore the message at their peril.

John Bull’s Other Islands
New Zealand a great future in Polynesia?
From MAURICE SHADBOLT in Auckland
IT is now almost thirty years since
Michael Joseph Savage, New Zea-
land’s first Labor Prime Minister,
came to power; almost thirty years since
his Labor Cabinet embarked on policies
that were to lead the country from mass
unemployment to the creation of the
world’s first thorough-going welfare
State.
When I was young, Mickey Savage’s
portrait seemed to hang in every second
or third New Zealand home; his benign,
grandfatherly face peered from the dis-
play windows of small shopkeepers.
Outside totalitarian countries there can
have been few political leaders in his-
tory so venerated.
“They think I am God,” Savage used
to say, with some justice. For there was
a religious fervor in the way New
Zealanders talked of how he had pulled
New Zealand out of the depression,
ended unemployment, put farmers back
on the land, built homes for the people,
stopped pensioners starving, and given
the country social security.
And there were unprecedented scenes
of grief when Savage died in 1940, after
less than five years in office. Like
thousands of other sleepy-eyed children,
I was tugged early from my bed one
morning to see the funeral train as it
passed up the North Island. Tears
flowed and Maoris ritually lamented;
few in our small town of three thousand
did not turn out to mourn the loss of a
loved national leader.
The Savage legend has been a long
time dying. His yellowing portrait might
hang in few homes now, but there
were semi-hysterical ravings in the cor-
respondence columns of New Zealand
newspapers last year when John A. Lee,
Left-swinging gadfly member of the first
Labor Cabinet, at last published his
political memoirs. Always Savage's
sternest critic in the Labor Party, Lee
was finally expelled in an appalling
struggle for power while Savage lay
dying. When this considerable author
and pamphleteer Lee was virtually
the Labor propaganda machine—re-
ceived his marching orders, the party
began its downhill slide which was to
end in electoral oblivion in 1949; and,
more sadly, in the ignominious and
abortive short-lived Labor administra-
tion of 1957-60.
The austere society
Tn his book Lee endeavors to deliver the
coup de grace to the Savage legend.
He pictures Savage as a bumbling, un-
imaginative man, essentially conserva-
tive, without ideology, originality or any
clear plan someone always afraid to
act until prodded by more alert col-
leagues. And a man so confused by the
world that months after he declared
war in 1939 he confessed that he didn’t
know what the war was all about.
All the known facts confirm the jus-
tice of Lee’s portrait. But perhaps the
most fascinating feature of his book,
the first credible account of Labor’s
post-depression administration, is the
way he reveals a government —which at
the time seemed the most purposeful and
decisive in New Zealand’s history liter-
ally staggering from idea to idea, policy
to policy, legislation to legislation.
The wonder is not just that a welfare
state was created. The wonder is that
anything durable was created at all.
Well, thirty years after, how does the
country stand?
True, we still have a well-padded wel-
fare state. It is also true that our social
security scheme, once a model for the
world, has long ago been overtaken in
breadth and depth by that of a dozen
other countries, Britain included. But,
despite marginal and seasonal scares,
unemployment has been non-existent in
New Zealand since the 19305. Home
ownership is accomplished with fan-
tastic ease here —probably more easily
than anywhere else in the world. No
capital is required; for a deposit young
parents simply cash the family benefit
in advance, and then the State comes to
light with a low-interest loan. In car
ownership, New Zealand ranks just
behind the United States and beside
Australia, and in fact may now even have
a slight edge on the latter. Food is
cheap and abundant, often subsidised by
the State (subsidised butter sells at
Is. lOd. a lb at my local store); per
capita, New Zealand heads the world in
meat consumption.
For all this, though, the overseas visi-
tor —from the USA, Britain or Aus-
tralia —is struck not so much by afflu-
ence as by austerity. New Zealand's
tight—and still tightening—import re-
strictions often mean a lamentable
range of consumer goods in shop win-
dows. There are recurrent and mad


dening shortages. To take just one —
but one which is driving every pipe-
smoker in this city of half a million up
the wall at the moment. It appears that
licences were not issued for the import
of pipe-cleaners (made in Britain) this
year; as a result many smokers —
thousands of whom have switched from
cigarettes because of Health Department
advice on lung cancer—are resorting to
cleaning their pipes with wire, feathers
and other odds and ends. In disgust
some have already returned to the
dreaded cigarette.
Blueprints for salvation
the vehicle is very likely as-
sembled here with more than 40 p.c.
New Zealand content, it is impossible
to buy a new car off the showroom
floor; the average car-buyer, unless he
can acquire overseas exchange by fair
means or foul, must go on a waiting
list for two or three years or longer.
Naturally there is an enormous used-car
racket; second-hand vehicles, one or two
years old, often fetch more than their
original price. (After twenty thousand
miles I sold my two-year-old Holden to
a dealer this week at just under new
price.)
Begun by Labor and carried on by
National, New Zealand’s industrialisation
campaign—that is, the creation of “hot-
house” import-protected industry—means
that items such as clothing and footwear
sell as exorbitant prices; so, too, do such
things as television sets. (The country
has had television for four or five years,
but it seems we must make do indefi-
nitely with one, rather feeble, politically
controlled channel.)
The fact of the matter is simply that
New Zealand is living beyond its means',
it can't export enough to pay for its
welfare state, for its generally high stan-
dard of living. Another paradox is that
though by far the majority of New Zea-
landers live in large towns or cities, the
country is still desperately dependent on
butter, wool and meat on the produce
of its pastures. Timber and paper pulp
aside the only major export growth in
recent years most industry here is still
not a very economic proposition; the best
thing that can be said of it (an important
best, however) is that it keeps us fully
employed. But our thinly populated
countryside can’t hope to support our
bulging cities forever. Moreover, even
primary production is failing to keep
pace with the rising population. Since
the great export crisis of 1958, over-
seas reserves have been run thin.
De Gaulle’s rejection of Britain’s applica-
tion to join the Common Market has
given New Zealand a breathing space
and we did come out of that breathing
hard—but it is only too clear that New
Zealand’s politicians don’t know what to
do with it. So while we precariously re-
tain our traditional market for agricultu-
ral produce in the United Kingdom
and seek fitfully for new markets in Asia
we also still live on the razor-edge of
crisis.
Blueprints for salvation come thick
and fast. Yesterday it was the fishing
industry; Japanese tuna-fishermen have
had to teach us that there is a profitable
source of export income in our waters.
Today it’s the tourist industry; it has
become an article of faith for our poli-
ticians —like non-recognition of Com-
munist China for American politicians—
that New Zealand is a potentially great
tourist nation. No one really believes
this, of course. And the fact is that
New Zealanders detest the idea of the
country being overrun by camera-
toting tourists, anyway. It will be 1966
before the country finishes its first jet
airport. If by some miracle we are still
in the race for the world’s tourists by
then, we’ll have ten years’ leeway to
make up.
So one thing hasn't changed in thirty
years. Nationally we still bumble from
idea to idea, policy to policy, legislation
to legislation. It is easy to accuse our
politicians of lack of imagination, lack
of vigor, but it is apparent that they
reflect a national malaise. New Zea-
land doesn’t know where it is going—
and perhaps it doesn't want to, much.
And anyway only a nark would cry
panic in a country said to be as near
Utopia as anything mankind has ever
known.
To say that New Zealand’s two major
political parties, Labor and National,
are often barely distinguishable is a
platitude, but nevertheless true enough.
When Labor leader Arnold Nordmeyer
last year said the National Government
was more or less socialist, like Labor,
he didn’t arouse much protest even in
National ranks. The only prominent
National MP thoroughly Right-wing,
Sir Leslie Munro (former NZ chairman
of the UN Security Council), appears to
be as unpopular in his own party as
he is with Labor. When capital punish-
ment was abolished for good and all
three years ago, a dozen National MPs
crossed the House to vote with the Labor
Opposition. Prime Minister Keith Holy-
oake has clamped down on anti-liberal
elements within his party; annual
National conferences no longer discuss
such matters as the restoration of birch-
ing for juvenile delinquents. In this and
other things he has done much to give
his party a new, liberal appearance; at
the last election the Nationalists who,
back in 1949, advocated the abolition of
such Labor extravagances as the Nation-
al Orchestra —even put forward a policy
for encouraging the arts in New Zealand.
In Ralph Hanan, the leading liberal of
the Holyoake Cabinet, New Zealand has
its most enlightened and intelligent
Minister of Maori Affairs in many years;
in racial matters, if in not much else, the
country is at least attempting to grasp
the nettle.
The Labor Opposition, though really
opposing for the first time in years, is
still slowly coming out of the doldrums.
Arnold Nordmeyer has had less than
eighteen months to make an impression
on his party; and one suspects that he
has been handicapped by the continued
presence in Parliament of ex-Prime
Minister Walter Nash, Labor’s grey emi-
nence, a benign and ineffectual grand-
fatherly figure in the Savage tradition.
Rumor has it that Nash hung like a dead
weight around the Labor Party’s neck
when it came to policy-making for the
last election; in the end Nordmeyer
called in a professional public relations
man —and he, it is said, virtually created
Labor policy for the elections. Still, the
party looks all the more impressive now
for its increased number of young MPs;
they have quickly made their presence
felt during the present session of Parlia-
ment, the first since the 1963 election.
If Labor fails again to win the 1966
election, it is probable that Nordmeyer
will have to give way to one of these
younger men; as an ex-Presbyterian
minister, Nordmeyer rightly or wrongly
leaves the impression of being wowserish,
a considerable electoral handicap in a
country still struggling to emerge from
Victorian ism. (Though it is true that
neither party has the guts to tackle the
social scandal of New Zealand’s licen-
sing laws.)
The predictable Press
T>robably the greatest obstacle to pro-
-*• gress in New Zealand is the lack of
an alert, lively, intelligent and informed
Press. This is the consequence of long-
held monopolies in all the major towns
and cities of the country. Even Auck-
land, the largest city, has only one morn-
ing and one evening newspaper. Wel-
lington, surely, has the poorest Press of
any capital city in the Western world.
Almost all newspapers are predictable
editorially; among other things there is
99 per cent support of the National


Party at elections. Hence the alarm
earlier this year when Lord Thomson
threatened to rock the boat and buy
up Wellington's morning paper “The
Dominion”, and the hasty Government
efforts to head off Thomson by pro-
mising Government legislation against
the takeover. The idea of an independent,
Thomson-owned newspaper was wel-
comed by most New Zealand journalists;
secretly it was welcomed by not a few
politicians on both sides of the House.
Ironically the day was saved for medio-
crity by an Australian newspaper propri-
etor, and now Rupert Murdoch is said
to be anxious to dispose of the large
holding in “The Dominion” which he
bought at an inflated price. In general,
it is fair to say that the profession of
journalism has been degraded by this
country’s daily newspapers. Most of the
best men either quit the daily Press or
leave for Sydney and London; oppor-
tunities are few. There are no foreign
correspondents, virtually no columnists,
few by-lines; comment on vital issues is
confined almost solely to editorials. About
the only daily paper with any sort of
responsibility or social conscience, any
real awareness of other than parish-
pump issues, is the “Auckland Star”—
the “Star”, for example, has sent stafi
men regularly to the New Zealand-ad-
ministered Cook Islands to examine our
behavior there. Time and again the
behavior of newspapers here on funda-
mental issues is curious in the extreme.
During the all-white All Black contro-
versy in 1959-60, the Wellington even-
ing paper declined to acknowledge that
such a controversy existed: it didn't men-
tion it even in news columns.
The great blind-spot
much for internal affairs. Externally?
Like Australians, New Zealanders
have, more or less, accepted that they live
in the Pacific, not the North Sea. But
they are still none too clear about the
implications of this, trade with Asia
aside. Certainly we appreciate that
such Asian issues as the Indonesian-
Malaysian confrontation have immense
significance for us—it is true that we
feel committed there, but it is equally
true that we feel something less than
committed to support of America in the
Vietnam disaster; in some areas—
notably in the Pacific islands—we have
slowly come to accept that we have more
than ordinary responsibilities as the
largest and wealthiest country in Poly-
nesia. Our greatest blind-spot, incred-
ibly enough, is our nearest Pacific neigh-
bor: Australia.
Or perhaps it isn't too incredible.
New Zealanders are, after all, only as
indifferent to Australia as Australians
are to New Zealand. Australia may be
making itself a power in the Pacific, but
its example seems irrelevant to us.
We’re physically handicapped in the
first place; we haven't a continent, nor
have we the material resources for much
heavy industry. And, anyway, we all
know about the Australian rat-race from
the spasmodic waves of Australian un-
employed who cross the Tasman to find
work here. In other words, to put it
politely, we have a rear-end view of
Australia's boom, and in a society pre-
occupied with social welfare and full
employment the view isn't always found
attractive.
Around the time of the Common
Market scare there was more talk about
some form of union with Australia than
there has been since New Zealand and
New South Wales were split apart in
the early 19th century; but there was
little of it that could be taken seriously.
Is political union feasible at this stage?
The two countries have been a long time
apart; the two societies have taken off
in different directions and have vastly
different problems. Moreover, it would
hardly be a union of equals. With four
times the population Australia would
swamp New Zealand.
When journalist lan Templeton visited
Canberra for the “Auckland Star” earlier
this year he found that the subject of
Australia-New Zealand union had at
least been considered over there. Arthur
Calwell came up with the most practical
proposition that the North and
South Islands of New Zealand could
join Australia as two separate States.
This notion was more apt than Calwell
probably knew: the fact is that the
North and South Islands have grown
apart in recent years, though it’s not
politically expedient to say so, and the
gap is steadily widening. The northward
drift of industry and population has be-
come more like a stampede. Seven out
of ten New Zealanders now live in the
busy North Island; the mainly rural
south stagnates—Dunedin, which since
gold-rush days has slipped from first
New Zealand city to fifth, has a virtu-
ally static population. And the South
Island has few of the many problems
which afflict the north —for example,
since it has an infinitesimal number of
Maoris, it is unlikely ever to have race
problems. North Islanders tend to look
back over their shoulders at Southerners
and dismiss them patronisingly. It is
possibly significant that the Cook Strait
even seems to cut across New Zealand
writing since the war; by far the bulk of
fiction is of and from the north and
if it deals with the south at all, it is usu-
ally written by South Islanders living in
the north. It is hard to think of one
novelist at present in the south. There
are two or three poets of significance,
and there the roll-call ends.
“A sour taste”
Qtill, pertinent though it may be, Cal-
well's proposition—like most others
that have been made—brings union no
closer. After all, it is New Zealanders, not
Australians, who would have to sink
their pride in such a union. As a nation
we have grown in the physical shadow of
Australia —that is, as far as the rest of
the world is concerned; to us Australia,
1200 miles across the wild Tasman, has
seldom been a near presence at all. And
the point is that after a hundred years
we have achieved, slightly later than
Australia (which was settled earlier by
Europeans), a semblance of distinctive
national identity. Traditionally, the two
countries have Anzac Day in common,
and very little else. Culturally, there has
been little or no interchange since Aus-
tralian and New Zealand writers mixed
in the pages of The Bulletin in the
1890 s. (Katherine Mansfield's first story
was published in Australia and even
Henry Lawson, with his New Zealand
residence and South Island stories, was
to some extent a trans-Tasman figure.)
But given physical circumstances and
British colonial origins, our two litera-
tures could now hardly be more different.
There is the occasional flash of self-
recognition for that rare bird here who
reads Australian writing—but of recent
important Australian novels there is per-
haps only Patrick White's “The Tree of
Man’’ which could, at a pinch, have
been equally well set in New Zealand.
The New Zealand writers who have emi-
grated to Australia, such as Douglas
Stewart and Olaf Ruhen, unlike those
who have emigrated elsewhere in the
world, have not continued to W'rite as
New Zealanders; they seem to have been
completely absorbed by the Australian
continent. Perhaps a warning is there
for the rest of us.
The distance —physical, traditional,
cultural between the two countries,
then, is great enough. It is probable that
New Zealand will grow humanly more
distinctive as well: that is, with a fast-
growing population of indigenous Maoris
and immigrant Pacific islanders, our soci-
ety will acquire a more and more notice-
able Polynesian shading. Inter-marriage

is common enough, and the present head
of the Maori Affairs Department, Mr
J. M. McEwen, has estimated that within
a few generations most New Zealanders
will have some Polynesian blood. In
Auckland city—one New Zealander in
five is an Aucklander—the trend is
aiready apparent. Within a few years—
with the accelerating Maori drift to the
cities, and increasing immigration from
over-crowded Pacific islands—it should
be startlingly obvious to the visitor
expecting a predominantly pale-skinned
population.
It is doubtful whether union with
Australia would be popular politically,
As historian-poet W. H. Oliver (who
sees New Zealand as a dependent Utopia
“vestigially British, incipiently Ameri-
can") has pointed out, such talk of union
leaves “a sour taste" in the mouth of
New Zealanders. And it is certainly true
that some New Zealanders would appear
to prefer anything, even union with the
USA as a 51st State, to this. New Zea-
land newspapers quietly but unanimously
killed the term ‘‘Australasian"' —the word
is literally never heard here now—•
because of the implied slight on New
Zealand. Super sensitivity? Perhaps; but
the fact is that New Zealand has too
often in the past been confused with
Australia by Americans, Europeans and
even Asians. Union with Australia
would mean quite simply a loss of what-
ever identity and respect New Zealand
has won for itself in the world.
Possibly the most that can be expected,
in this second half of the 20th century,
is some kind of free-trade area; but
even that is likely to be a tenuous thing.
A proposal for a limited free - trade
area is at present before the New Zea-
land Cabinet, but already there are re-
ports that officials in the Industries and
Commerce Department are less than
lukewarm about the idea. They feel
that the concessions would all be on
New Zealand's side, that the development
of New Zealand industry would be
sacrificed in the hope of some nebulous
future gain from Australia. They could
be right: anything involving a closer link
with Australia appears to involve New
Zealand concessions rather than Aus-
tralian.
Umbilical cord through Panama
Tt would be interesting to know, any-
way, what history will make of our
extraordinary indifference to each other.
How often has an Australian Prime
Minister visited Wellington, or a New
Zealand Prime Minister visited Can-
berra? Work down to other levels, and
the answers are almost as incredible.
Take away the men who fought together
at Gallipoli, the interchange of ex-
servicemen on Anzac Day, and very little
is left; very little except sport. That
doesn't amount to much, either. New
Zealand cricketers can't be taken seri-
ously over there, and Australian Rugby
Union is seldom taken seriously here
and, after all, involves only New South
Wales and Queensland. In recent years
our high-powered Olympic athletes may
have made some impression on Aus-
tralians, but even that is doubtful.
Perhaps history will find an explana-
tion in geography, and I’m not thinking
merely of the Tasman Sea. From the
time the Panama Canal was sliced
through Central America, there has been
a certain gravitational pull apart. Aus-
tralia's umbilical cord to Europe ran
through Suez, New Zealand’s through
Panama. Now that the cord is cut —or
at least badly frayed—there is no reason
why the two countries shouldn’t grow
closer together; no reason, other than
that no one on either side of the Tas-
man really cares much one way or the
other.


OUT AND ABOUT
A Visitor from
Another Planet
Mr Mboya’s brand of soft insistence
By PETER HASTINGS
In the boardroom of the Federated
Ironworkers’ Association in Sydney
last week, where he addressed rep-
resentatives of more than a million Aus-
tralian trade unionists, Kenya’s Tom
Mboya might have been a visitor from
another planet. He was introduced by
the FlA’s Laurie Short who did the
Kenyan Minister for Justice proud.
Mboya said later that Short was the
first Australian he had ever met. Every-
one nodded appreciatively and there was
a pleasant, intimate atmosphere about
the meeting.
Despite all this it was not, perhaps,
an entirely successful occasion which
had nothing to do with either Mr Short’s
hospitable arrangements or with Mr
Mboya’s impressive personality. Mr
Mboya’s message was that of a remoter
if more urgent world with its own ambi-
guities. But these weren’t entirely the
reasons for a slight note of disenchant-
ment. Mr Mboya looked excessively
tired under the bright television lights
although strikingly handsome in a well
tailored blue suit, matching blue and
brown striped tie and the whitest of
Persil-white shirts.
He wanted to talk about trade
unionism in his own country and in
Africa, he said, and to deliver, if he
might take the liberty, two messages.
His reputation as a talker is well
founded. He is clear, logical, fluent and
humorless. He speaks with a pure
accent and when he twice tripped over
the first two syllables of the word
“necessarily” he gave just the ghost of
a smile which made him entirely charm-
ing. It was, nevertheless, a fleeting
smile because Mr Mboya was intent on
other things than being charming.
He explained the Kenya Trade Union
organisation at great length, and several
union stalwarts in the front row stiffened
perceptibly when Mr Mboya bluntly
implied that in capital-short Kenya
strikes are just not tolerated. A little
later ACTU’s Albert Monk seemed
blandly stunned when Mboya said that
in the pursuit of Nairobi’s policy of
non-alignment the Kenya Trade Union
organisation wanted nothing to do with
either the Communist-controlled WCTU
or the ICFTU to whose executive Albert
Monk belongs. Kenya, Mr Mboya went
on persuasively, wanted to be non-
aligned like India.
As for the messages, he said, the first
concerned South Africa. Would not
Australians generally, and trade unionists
in particular, take a stand over Dr
Verwoerd’s republic? Sanctions, he said
in his soft, clear voice, were the correct
tactics. Boycotting goods to and from
South Africa was not enough. South
Africa should suffer active world wide
reprisals. All-out sanctions were neces-
sary if South Africa’s whites were “to
be saved from themselves”. Black
people in South Africa were being
gaoled, beaten, detained on suspicion,
deprived of property rights.
How could he or Mr Kenyatta or
Tanganyika’s Nyerere face their own
black people when these terrible things
were happening to their black neighbors
in South Africa, Southern Rhodesia,
Mozambique and Angola? Consider for
a moment, he said, the position of
white people in Kenya and elsewhere.
If nothing were done about South Africa
could they be left in the peace which
he and Mr Kenyatta wished to see them
enjoy? There were other ways of deal-
ing with South Africa apart from sanc-
tions. Why send Australian sportsmen
to South Africa? Why invite South
African teams to Australia? The OAU
(Organisation for African Unity) for in-
stance, had got all African countries to
forbid any South African aircraft or
ship either landing or port rights any-
where in the African continent outside
of South African territory. This was an
effective reprisal. Unless something
were done about South Africa there
would be a holocaust, he said, with prim
precision which scarcely disguised, one
divined, a deadly impatience. His mes-
sage about New Guinea turned out to
be more or less what had already been
reported in the Press, except for a special
admonition that the unions in Australia
carried a special charge to encourage
and look after trade unionism in New
Guinea. He had met members of the
infant New Guinea trade union move-
ment and had found it a struggling and
discouraged organisation where it should
be developing into one of the institutions
upon which independence could be
based.
The TV lights were turned out. It
was over. His audience turned to tea
and sandwiches, returned for a few
questions and then Mr Mboya smiled,
shook hands and went back to Kirribilli
House.

in the surge for independence unless you
have educated leaders. Why is Aus-
tralia so unaware of this problem, so
unaware of the world? I suggested to
an Administration officer in Popondetta
that Australia would be embarrassed by
the UN if she does not hasten to train
and educate leaders. He replied, ‘lt is
we who will embarrass the UN.’ Do
they really believe that?
“Why this exclusiveness? You cannot
carry this burden by yourselves and there
is no reason why you should. There are
international agencies, let alone foreign
governments, which would help share the
load. After all Australia is still a develop-
ing country and itself in need of capital
investment for Australian projects. It
should not have to foot the whole bill
just so that it can carry out the entire
task by itself. Besides, there are advan-
tages in letting other nationals help you,
new views, new attitudes.
“You have a wonderful opportunity up
there despite the terrain and the com-
munications problem. It's up to you. You
should get others to help you. Don’t try
and do it all by yourselves.” He yawned
and look at his watch.
"C'arlier he had stressed Kenya's deter-
mination, indeed that of all black
Africa, to remain non-aligned, un-
involved, by either East or West despite
Commonwealth links or any other ties.
How then did he feel about develop-
ments in the Congo and in Zanzibar?
He looked up sharply, now wide
awake. “Your point is a good one. In
the Congo I should like to see the
Organisation of African Unity place
troops at Tshombe’s disposal. We do not
like him, none of us do, for obvious
reasons. But some of us feel that he
should be given troops to subdue the
Communists and to restore order in the
Congo. Zanzibar does not worry us so
much. That can be fixed in time. Nyerere
has a difficult task but we feel he is
doing the right thing.
“If Zanzibar had not been included
in the Tanganyikan Federation, in Con-
tinental Africa, it would have become
an offshore centre of subversion, an-
other Cuba. We had to clutch it to us
and work to isolate the harmful elements.
When it is time to ratify the Constitu-
tion next year it will be time to deal
with subversives. But I have said
enough.” He looked at his watch again.
A Commonwealth High Commissioner
now waited in the drawing room. A
last question about South Africa. “Yes?”
While common ground might be
assumed with many in the need to do
something, and to do something quickly,
to redress a disastrous imbalance and to
prevent a conflagration which would
reach far beyond the shores of Africa,
would not tremendous injustices occur in
the name of reform? He sighed. “That
is the problem. Where to start. Perhaps
a limited franchise for all colored people
who have reached Standard 8 . .?” He
stood up, hand outstretched, voice trail-
ing away. It seemed the perfect anti-
climax, for Standard 8 seemed, in its
turn, a strangely prosaic glimpse into
the uncertainties beyond.

The Scared Millionaires
" When the America’s Clip goes the Aussies will take it”
From GEORGE McGANN in New York
Seldom in the history of sport have
so many, with so much, been so
frightened of so few. America’s
millionaire yachtsmen, who have held
the America’s Cup for 113 years, pay a
great deal of lip service to the sportsman-
like notion that “it’s about time someone
else won it”. But don’t believe for one
moment that they actually mean it. They
are determined to spend all the dollars
necessary (and they have them) and
change all the rules necessary (and
they control them) to ensure that
the bottomless old silver pitcher
remains securely fastened to its glass-
encased table in the trophy room of the
New York Yacht Club on West Forty-
Fourth Street.
They are scared stiff lest the brash
Australians make off with their prize
possession the next time up. And they
are taking all the precautions they can
think of to make sure this dreadful
calamity does not befall them.
The governors of the venerable Yacht
Club who possess the deed of gift of the
America’s Cup, and can alter it any
time they see fit, got the shock of their
sheltered lives two years ago when
Gretel took one race from Weatherly
and finished a scant 26 seconds behind
the American sloop in another race over
the 24-mile Cup course off Newport,
Rhode Island.
Weatherly had scarcely been hauled
and her bottom dried before the
governors gathered on Forty-Fourth
Street to change the long-standing rules
of Cup competition in order to make sure
no future foreign challenger could be
model-tested in an American tank, or
acquire American-made sails, spars and
other gear, as had Gretel.
Many Americans thought at the time
that this was not quite cricket, although
obviously it was the way things went in
the rarified atmosphere of twelve-metre
racing.
Yankee sailors are now preparing to
deal with the latest of many British
challenges in the waters of Rhode Island
Sound, but they seem more worried
about the small band of Australian
observers gathered to witness this month’s
Cup series than they are about the Bri-
tish.
“When the Cup goes the Aussies will
take it,” one veteran waterfronter told
me in Newport last week.
The Americans are convinced from
what they have seen of the recent trials
among the five American yachts and
the concurrent trials between the two
British twelves, Sovereign and Kur-
rewa V, in Newport waters that the
new American sloops, Constellation and
American Eagle, are both considerably
faster.
T>ut confidence in immediate victory
over the British has not diminished
American fears of eventual defeat by
Australia. On the contrary.
Even before final selection of their de-
fending sloop (at the moment of writing
everyone expects Constellation to sail
against Sovereign ) the NY Yacht Club
brass hats announced with considerable
pride the formation of a “twelve-metre
development fund” as a kind of insur-
ance that America would continue its
dominance of twelve-metre yachting
even in non-Cup years. With the new
Cup rules of 1962, the club has enforced
a three-year wait on the Australians and
other potential challengers in the event
of American victory this month.
Ignoring completely (and arrogantly)
the possibility of a British victory, the
governors explained that the fund had
been inspired by the “determined efforts
of Australian yachtsmen” to capture the
Cup. Australian designers such as Alan
Payne, Trygve Halvorsen and Warwick
Hood; Sydney sailmaker Joe Pearce and
G ret el’s former skipper, Jock Strurock,
have been in Newport for weeks ob-
serving every detail of both the British
and American preparations.
A half-dozen or more wealthy Ameri-
cans had already contributed to the new
fund and more were certain to do so, it
was announced, “in order to keep our
designers, sailmakers and builders work-
ing on twelves in non-Cup years and to
make sure there will be no lethargy
during the off years, as at present”.
The usual figure given for producing
a twelve-metre racing machine is “about
a half-million dollars”. This invariably
provokes someone into recounting the
late J. P. Morgan’s reply when asked
if yachting were an expensive sport:
“If you have to ask how much it costs,
you can’t afford it.”
It is apparent that this seemingly
genteel sport of America’s Cup racing is
really a cut-throat business, in which the
holding nation has adopted the profes-
sional attitude of “anything goes” —•
that is, if it assures success.
But after a weekend of visiting old
haunts at Newport, I can report that
very few residents of the picturesque
community share the cynical attitude of
the Yacht Club panjandrums. Far from
worrying about a distant “Australian
menace”, everyone I met after the two-
year lapse since the Gretel-Weatherly
series expressed the whole-hearted wish
that it was Australia challenging for the
Cup this year instead of England.
“The Aussies pepped this town up,”
said the good lady who used to sell me
the morning newspapers at Jane's Variety
Store. “They were a lively crowd. The
English are different. They go home
and drink tea each afternoon. The
Aussies drank beer and talked to every-
one.”
At the Cameo Club, the waterfront
pub where the crews of Gretel and Vim
sank a few each evening after racing
w'as done, 1 spotted a new flashing neon
sign over the entrance: “Royal Cameo
Yacht Squadron”. This, of course, was
the name given the place by the Austra-
lian yachtsmen in 1962 and which has
now become permanent.
One of the barmen who used to pass
schooners of Narragansett beer over to
Norm Wright, Frank McNulty and
other stalwarts of Gretel’s foredeck
lamented: “This place is like a morgue
compared to 1962. We see an occa-
sional lad from Norsagci, the English
trial horse, but none of the Sovereign or
Kurrewa crews. Jock Sturrock and
Joe Pearce were in the other day, and
they were a sight for sore eyes.”

Near Dawn,
on Sunday
" Oh, you big rat!"
From LARRY FOLEY
in Townsville
They had done their warm-up laps
and were now doing one-lap
sprints.
A few went solo, but mostly they went
in twos and threes, indiscriminately—a
freestyler, a backstroker and a breast-
stroker together, or a freestyler against a
couple of butterflyers.
They were racing the clock rather than
each other. A large electric time-piece
with a single sweep-second hand hung on
the wall at the far end. There, too, stood
the coach, Terry Gathercole, with a
stopwatch.
The starters got on their mark, eyes
on the clock, and took off on the minute,
the quarter, half or three-quarters. As
they touched, they flashed a look at the
clock. Then, recovering their breath,
they had a word with Terry, hauled
themselves out and walked back to await
their next turn. The system meant a
few minutes’ rest between sprints.
Among the waiting group frolicked
two little fair-haired girls with pony
tails, in blue costumes. They were
sucking red-and-green gob-stoppers on
sticks. One held hers up to Dawn
Fraser. Dawn bent, took a good nibble.
At mid-pool a beefy chap with a big
underwater camera submerged from time
to time and shot the girls as they went
by. Official? “A hobby,” he said.
Dawn, walking back to the start,
asked him:
“Can you see if I'm dropping my right
elbow?”
“I'll watch next time,” he said.
A backstroker flopped into the water
to take up her starting position. Terry
gave a sharp whistle. He gesticulated.
The backstroker shook her head resign-
edly, climbed out, poised on the edge,
plunged, and did a lap butterfly.
Jan Turner did a lap freestyle. Dawn
walked down to meet her, put her arm
around her shoulder, and walked back
with her, saying:
“Listen, how ’bout taking it easy for a
while? Your style’s all gone.” Dawn
demonstrated.
The work went on. A backstroker, on
a solo lap, veered way off course. Her
team-mates called after her, in good-
natured derision, but she went on,
unheeding.
Dawn was walking back with Mar-
guerithe Ruygrok.
“You watch your dive, too,” said
Dawn.

“What's wong with it?”
“You’re letting your feet . . The
words were lost.
Dawn did a racing dive for the photo-
grapher. Then she did a few strokes
breastroke.
“Try your butterfly,” a team-mate
urged. Dawn surged back with a series
of powerful butterfly lunges.
“You wouldn’t think I was up late last
night, would you?” said Dawn.
“Shhhhhh . . .!” several shushed.
A lady with mauve hair, a pink dress,
white shoes, turquoise bracelets and
white cigarette holder chatted with the
girls.
“Everybody won hundreds and hun-
dreds of pounds,” Dawn said. “I won
thirty bob. Big punter, me. Like five
bob each way.”
A sharp whistle from Terry. The
girls gathered at his end. Sprints were
over. Red and white foam kick-boards
were brought out from the locker-room.
The girls did a number of laps kicking.
This was done without apparent strain.
Dawn, Lyn Bell, Kim Herford and
Robyn Thorn paddled cosily together,
chatting.
A sharp whistle from Terry. Wide
rubber bands were now produced.
Several of the girls put them around
their ankles and swam, legs dragging.
A sharp whistle from Terry. Kick-
boards and rubber bands were given up,
and the girls swam free, loose and easy,
winding up the session. After the
effortful sprints, their swimming now
had a tip-toe quality; there is a certain
stealth in the motion of an expert swim-
mer who is merely making distance, not
trying for speed—the hands dipping
quietly, not chopping, the feet not thresh-
ing, merely fluttering.
The two little girls lay in wait. One
seized Dawn’s foot as she swam by.
Dawn stopped. “All right,” she said,
“hang on.” She swam a few yards, then
stopped. “You've got to kick,” she
admonished.
The little girl kicked now, and got
towed to the end of the pool. She was
having great fun.
Lyn Bell went back to the dressing-
room. She emerged, started out to re-
join the group, paused as she saw Dawn
idling by the edge of the pool, then
skipped behind the railing, Dawn
approached, reached over and mussed
Lyn’s hair.
“Oh, you big rat!” cried Lyn. “I
brought my comb for you. Now you’re
not getting it.”
“I don't want to do my hair, thank
you,” said Dawn. She picked up one
of the little girls. Marg Ruygrok saw
her chance, shoved. Dawn toppled in,
still clutching the little one.
The little girl came up, spluttering.
“Oh Margie,” she shrieked, “that’s not
funny. I didn’t hold my nose.”
On The Margin
LADY CHATTERLEY'S FRIEND
spring bargain sale at Angus and
A Robertson’s in Sydney is a stern
day of judgment for books and
authors. Here on parade are the
throw-outs, the works for which
effective demand has sunk to zero.
What a poignant tale of public in-
difference must lie behind, for exr
ample, the offering of The Big Drink ,
by E. J. Kahn, Jr, “an unofficial his-
tory of Coca-Cola” (formerly 19s.
lid.), for 3s. lid.
Two items at the sale this year
aroused special interest and concern
in trade circles. They were: The
Modern Sex Manual, by Edward
Podolsky, MD. Reduced from 255.
to 10s.
The Ideal Sex Life, by Dr J. Rut-
gens. Reduced from 355. to 20s.
Pessimists have issued warnings for
some time past about the over-pro-
duction of sex books. This concerns
not only the instructional or do-it-
yourself branch of the subject—to
which the works mentioned belong
but the psychology, picture-book and,
above all, fiction divisions. The cut-
price offering of The Modern Sex
Manual indicates that the long-feared
break in the market has arrived.
A few years ago manuals of this
kind were bought eagerly by Austra-
lians who took a pride in a well-
equipped home. They had a place
by every fireside. Today they are
hard to sell because the average
reader knows what is in them already.
It is the same as with refrigerators,
which move more slowly now that
everybody has one.
The danger of a slump in frank
fiction is another and more serious
matter, affecting as it does a large
sector of the book business. There
was an ominous item at the same
bargain sale — Carlotta Mcßride, by
C. O. Gorham, reduced from 18s. 9d.
to ss. When first published, this
outspoken novel worried our Customs
censors; today it is dead in the shops.
People in the trade are asking un-
easily: is this kind of thing the start
of a trend? Is it possible that the
bottom will fall out of erotic fiction?
Such a change could throw the
whole literary industry into chaos.
Vast production lines in America
would grind to a halt. Many once-
famous novelists might be faced with
unemployment and ruin unless they
could convert to the requirements of
the wholesome fiction trade. One can
picture them sweating away to pro-
duce titles like Lady Chatterley’s
Friend or Lolita of Sunnybrook Farm.
Yet this development is not an im-
possibility. There is some evidence
of a reaction by the reading public
against the deluge of fearless, chal-
lenging novels. One sign is an inno-
vation at a big lending library in
Britain. The staff there marks with
a white spot novels which do not
emphasise sex. The chief librarian
explained: “There is a small but grow-
ing class of readers who are interested
in these books.”
The people referred to are embar-
rassed when they have to ask the staff
for something clean to read. They are
afraid other subscribers will point
them out as cranks. Now, instead of
looking round furtively for a decent
novel, they can pick one at a glance
by the white spot.
Persons of the same independent
tastes exist in Australia. They are
seen sometimes at bookstalls. They
wistfully scan the paperbacks dis-
played, looking for one with a fully-
dressed girl on the cover.
School teachers report, too, that
adolescents are curious to know what
non-erotic literature is like. Some
have been found secretly circulating
pure novels behind the desks.
What do these indications add up
to? A simple demonstration of clas-
sical economics. With the aid of
modern production techniques, the
market for frankness has been
grossly over-supplied. It is in danger
of collapse. There may be a Black
Tuesday when illustrated books on
Indian Temple Sculptures will be
offered at give-away prices.
A curious aspect of the situation is
the role of the Customs Department.
While the prices of frank books are
falling, it uses its powers to create an
artificial scarcity. The Modern Sex
Manual has been marked down to
10s.; and at the same time the De-
partment bans Fanny Hill and the
Kama Sutra. It almost appears to
be operating a price-support pro-
gramme.
Yet the indications suggest that in
the present state of the market, even
if the Kama Sutra were allowed in, it
would be hard to sell at a profit.
Booksellers who stocked it would
stand in tears amid the alien porn.

One of aluminium’s many benefits is its
extremely high conductivity of heat. That’s
why it has been used in this giant 8-inch
diameter heat exchanger designed by War-
burton Franki. Its 22 fins provide a large
surface area, and thus permit rapid heat
dissipation through natural convection and
radiation. Used with semi-conductor
diodes in power rectifier equipment, it
eliminates the need for motor-driven
cooling fans.
The die for this complex extrusion was
disigned and made by Australuco’s
engineers. Basically, extruding is like
squeezing toothpaste from a tube...except
for factors like pressure (58 tons p.s.i.),
tolerances (fractional variations mean the
difference between success and failure),
and rigidity (the bending or buckling of
cooling metal must be avoided).
That’s why there’s more to achievement
in aluminium than the metal itself.
Achievement also means Australuco’s years
of experience in extruding (over 7,000
different dies), research, testing, design,
metallurgical improvements . . . years of
practical application which can be summed
up in two words: know-how. So, when
you add technical skill and expertise to
aluminium’s inherent qualities (lightness,
strength, heat conductivity, corrosion resis-
tance), achievement is the natural result.
Australuco’s engineers and technicians,
backed by the world-wide experience and
knowledge of the Alcan Group, are able to
supply the latest information about the
many applications of aluminium in all
phases of Australian industry.

OVERSEAS
Reaching the Point of
Diminishing Returns
Vietnam, Laos and the Americans
From JOHN STIRLING in Bangkok
The paradox of the United States’
presence in South-East Asia is that
Americans are liked, but the US
itself is feared and mistrusted. Prince
Sihanouk of Cambodia plays volley-ball
with his favorite partner, a US military
adviser, then goes out and denounces US
policies in the most violent terms.
In South Vietnam, hundreds of US
servicemen have married local girls, but
there is no marriage of minds between
the Pentagon and successive regimes in
Saigon. In Laos, US aid officials are
given the bad (a sacred thread worn
round the wrist) as a symbol of affec-
tion; but the recent coup d'etat under-
lined by a group of ultra-nationalist offi-.
cers had clear anti-US overtones.
The individual American in South-East
Asia endears himself to the people by
his generosity, and absence of the colon-
ialist complex. But the leaders of the
South-East Asian countries look beyond
individuals. Their comments on US
policy show a strange unanimity .
“Some people have a mistaken idea
of US aid. They think that Americans
just hand out dollars for the asking. That
is not true they attach heavy, often
humiliating conditions.”
“Repudiation of US aid creates many
financial difficulties, but repudiation is
absolutely necessary for our independ-
ence.”
“You (Americans) seem unsure. Com-
pared to your strength, your policies
seem weak in purpose. That is what
makes it difficult for us Asians to under-
stand you.”
These remarks are quoted, in order,
from the late President Ngo Dinh Diem,
a staunch anti-Communist: from Prince
Sihanouk, an adept at neutralism: and
from General Kong Le, a patriot without
an ideology. Practically the only idea
held in common by these diverse person-
alities is their suspicion of the aims and
effects of US aid.
The truth seems to be that South-East
Asia has not yet got used to US aid: nor
US aid to South-East Asia. Only 14 years
ago there were 180 US servicemen and
diplomats in South-East Asia. Today the
figure is nearer 22,000. Since 1950, the
US Government has spent some $5OOO
million (£2,500,000,000) in economic
and military aid, and the golden tide has
drawn America into ever-closer involve-
ment with the receiving countries.
This process is seen most clearly in
South Vietnam. There, US involvement
now extends down to battalion level in
the Army, and district level in the
administration. President Diem realised
that the deeper the US commitment be-
came, the more his concept of “national
discipline” would clash with US ideas of
liberalisation. In the event, the collision
of ideas brought about his downfall and
death.
President Diem’s fall was not mourned
in Vietnam, nor in the surrounding coun-
tries. But the catharsis in Saigon last
November sharply reminded South-East
Asia of two realities America’s power
in South Vietnam, and the expendability
of its personal allies. It is remembered
that only three months before the depart-
ing US Ambassador to South Vietnam,
Mr Frederick Nolting, had commended
Mr Diem and his policies in the most
fulsome terms.
Oimilar zig-zags have been witnessed in
Laos. General Kong Le, currently the
darling of the military attaches in Vien-
tiane, was branded as pro-Communist in
1960, and forced into an alliance with
the pro-Communist Pathet Lao. From
his subsequent actions and statements
it is clear that he has never understood
■ — far less supported the Communist
faction in Laos. But from American Cen-
tral Intelligence Agency’s mistaken as-
sessment of Kong Le many disasters
flowed.
In 1960 America’s favorite son was the
right-wing General Phoumi Nosavan.
Within 18 months, State Department and
Pentagon thinking on Laos underwent a
180-degree turn, and hopes were pinned
on an alliance of the right wing and
the neutralists. From that point General
Nosavan’s star waned. His fellow gener-
als have stripped him of the profitable
business monopolies which he set up in
his heyday, and the US Embassy is nei-
ther willing nor able to help him.
In Cambodia, Prince Sihanouk has
never forgiven the US since he uncovered
a clumsy plot against him in 1957, which
involved a CIA agent. Since then the US

“Lubeless” cars and “changeless”
oils ... a promise of more
carefree motoring? But road
safety authorities warn of
the attendant dangers.
How necessary is that regular lube? Let's
look at the facts.
First, lubrication itself may take only a
fraction of the time your car spends in the
bay. Far more important is that devoted to
checking normally-hidden trouble spots in
linkages, braking systems, tyres, etc.
At Caltex stations, numerous checks are
carried out in the routine of a 1,000 mile
Marfak Service. Result—incipient faults can
be spotted while correction is still a matter
of minor adjustment.
Extend the interval, and you multiply
five or six times the chance of a slight fault
growing into a major repair job. At best,
your “saving” on the services you cut may
turn out a very false economy. And if a
sudden driving emergency, not a service
mechanic, shows up an unsuspected defect
... the results may be all too tragic.
In fact, recent road figures show a
disturbing upsurge of accidents due to
mechanical failures. An acknowledged
expert and Road Safety Councillor said
recently that regular safety inspections were
needed to see that wheel bearings, springs,
brakes, universals, shackles and tyres were
in safe condition. Any faults in these could
be spotted—on the lubrication hoist.
The second fact is simply that few Aus-
tralian drivers have a real choice. Experts
warn of serious effects when the oil change
interval is extended for “older” engines. And
only some cars have the special provision
that makes extended lubrication intervals
permissible (though they can be shortened
without adverse effect). For most of us,
1,000 miles maximum is the maker’s
instruction.
These are the facts. The hoist awaits.
The decision is yours.

has revised its policy towards Cambodia:
but the Prince is not mollified. Lie de-
clared recently: “Certainly, after the
death of Mr Dulles, the US Government
has declared itself to respect neutralism
in general, and our neutrality in particu-
lar. But between the words and the deeds
of the Anglo-Saxons there is a gulf which
never ceases to widen.” He points out
that Britain and the US have failed to
reconvene the 14-nation Geneva Con-
ference to guarantee Cambodia’s neutra-
lity and frontiers, as he desires.
Cambodia is in many ways a special
case. But in other areas as well, there
are manifest inconsistencies between US
actions and public statements. These in-
consistencies cause jubilation among
America's enemies in South-East Asia,
and distress to her allies. Some recent
shifts of policy (e.g., towards President
Diem) are imposed by events. But others
are the product of bad intelligence, slip-
shod appreciations and inter-agency
vendettas.
Unfortunately, there is no sign that
these basic weaknesses are being correc-
ted; America's predictable reaction to
failures of policy is to cover them with a
fresh layer of aid, equipment and ad-
visers. The military mind, now dominant
in South Vietnam and Laos, tends to the
simple solution that if X number of mili-
tary advisers fail to achieve the objective,
then twice that number must surely do
so.
This assumption, which can be fatal
to America’s effort in Asia, is based on
the premise that the more Western aid
given to an Asian country, the more
anti-Communist it becomes.
A glance at the recent history of
South-East Asia reveals the falsity of this
assumption. Laos, which in relation to its
population has received a more intense
aid effort than anywhere else in the
world, remains the tottering outpost it al-
ways was. By contrast, Thailand, which
receives about one tenth the aid per
capita given to Laos, has limited its
Communist problem to a few malcon-
tents in the North-East. Burma, virtually
without support from the West, has at
least contained the armed revolt by White
Flag and Red Flag Communists.
The lesson to be drawn from post-
war developments in Asia is that where
the people have a strong national con-
sciousness they resist Communism, with
or without Western aid. Nationalism is
stronger even than Communist solidarity,
as revealed by the Sino-Soviet dispute.
But where nationalism does not exist, it
cannot be created by dollars, pounds or
francs.
Nor will neutralisation, as proposed by
President de Gaulle, fill the gap. Until
China abandons its role as the “vanguard
of liberation movements” in South-East
Asia, neutralism offers but a temporary
respite. Prince Sihanouk, in one of his
frequent discourses on neutralism, ex-
plains that it is only the confrontation
between China and the “Anglo-Saxons”
in South-East Asia which permits Cam-
bodia to survive. Once America pulls out
of South-East Asia he believes that Cam-
bodia will then be partitioned by China’s
Asian satellites.
Clearly, America’s path in Indo-China
must lie somewhere between de Gaullism
and Goldwaterism. The easy solution, of
increasing military and economic subsi-
dies, has been proved wanting. In poli-
tics, as in economics, the law of diminish-
ing returns operates. Before increasing its
already-gigantic commitments, the US
should assess more accurately the impact
of its existing programmes. In many
fields, it will be found that the point of
diminishing returns has been reached,
and passed, (ofns)

Training Tanzan’s Army
Nyerere - “Iansam's don’t like it any better ...”
From COLIN LEGUM in Dar-es-Salaam
United Republic of Tanganyika
and Zanzibar has become the first
African country to have a Chinese mili-
tary mission to help train its army. The
decision to secure Chinese participation
is part of an elaborately balanced plan
to have several major military Powers
engaged in training the republic's army,
which is being reformed after its mutiny
earlier this year.
In an exclusive interview with me,
President Julius K. Nyerere disclosed
that an agreement had been signed re-
cently in Peking by one of his two
Vice-Presidents, Mr Rashidi Kawawa.
His statement will clear the air of rumors
which have been
current in diplo-
matic circles here
for several weeks,
during which time
sustained efforts
have been made by
some of the major
Western Powers, as
well as the Soviet
bloc, to dissuade the
United Republic
from signing such an
agreement.
I understand that
the Chinese military
mission will com-
prise 11 instructors
in weaponry, and
that they will com-
plete their training
within a maximum
of six months under the agreement. They
are due to arrive within a few weeks of
the republic’s first retrained battalion,
which passed out on September 1. Their
task is limited to instruction in the use of
Chinese and similar pattern weapons
which reached Tanganyika even before
the revolution in Zanzibar last January.
Dr Nyerere disclosed that the Chinese
had themselves insisted on a maximum
period of training of six months. The
agreement, I believe, does not provide
for either an extension or an enlarge-
ment of their role.
Explaining his decision to invite a
Chinese element in his military training
programme, Dr Nyerere said that it
should be seen in its proper perspective
as part of a carefully-balanced policy.
He disclosed that he is about to sign a
five-year agreement with West Germany
to train the Republican Army’s air wing.
Originally it was intended that the
Israelis should be associated with this air
training, but they have since withdrawn
at their own request. The bulk of the
Army’s officers are British-trained. It is
an open secret that negotiations are pro-
ceeding with the United States for a
training programme to provide an en-
larged and modernised police force.
Russia and East Germany are already
engaged in training the revolutionary
army of Zanzibar under agreements
made before the union was signed last
April. I understand that nearly 60 Rus-
sian and East German instructors are in
Zanzibar training about 600 men, in-
cluding a number of Tanganyikan offi-
cers. In a separate military camp on
the island the Chin-
ese are training a
further 300 Zanzi-
baris. Co-ordination
between the authori-
ties of Zanzibar and
the mainland over
their military train-
ing has not yet been
fully completed
since the formation
of the union four
months ago.
The fact that
there is at present no
element of British
or Commonwealth
participation in the
republic’s military
and police training
plans is not the re-
sult of Dr Nyerere’s
choosing. “Ideally I would have prefer-
red to see our army trained by a joint
Commonwealth mission,” he told me.
“But my efforts to achieve this did not
succeed.”
When the British Commonwealth
Secretary, Mr Duncan Sandys, visited
Tanganyika a few months ago I under-
stand that he put forward a number of
proposals for British military assistance,
but these proved to be unacceptable to
President Nyerere’s government. Sub-
sequently the President made repeated
efforts to persuade the Canadians to par-
ticipate in training his army, but he
received little positive response. How-
ever, a Canadian offer to train officers
has been- accepted. Sweden, too, was
approached. But it took the line that
it could provide military training only
under United Nations agreement —a
position which Dr Nyerere respects.
“Having made these efforts to obtain
what I needed from the Commonwealth

and from the middle-sized Powers, but
without success, what was there left for
me to do?” Dr Nyerere asked. “Our
country, unfortunately, needs a modern,
well-trained army. It can only be a
small army, which makes it all the more
necessary that it should be effective and
well equipped.
“Also, I want it to be an army trained
to meet the special circumstances of this
country. I do not want it to be an
elite force, but an army integrated with
the national life and attuned to our own
political system. That is why we have
undertaken to provide the major part of
our training ourselves. But we are
obviously not able to do it all ourselves.
If the Commonwealth and the small
Powers are unwilling or otherwise unable
to provide the help needed, we have
no alternative than to rely on the big
Powers.
“Faced with this alternative, my duty
was to ensure that I would not put my
country into the hands of any single
major Power for military assistance.
The need, therefore, was to secure some
kind of balance.”
“No alternative”
lAr Nyerere said he recognised that it
was far from ideal to have an army
trained by a number of countries with
different techniques and weapons. “But
I was not given the alternative of
choosing an ideal method. Everybody
will have the chance of teaching us
something, and we will then do the best
we can with the training and equipment
we have received.”
Asked whether he was not afraid of
the risks he was taking by accepting a
Chinese military presence for even six
months, the President replied, “What are
the risks I am taking? The army that
proved itself disloyal to my Government
was not one that was trained by the
Chinese. There is always some element
of risk about having an army at all in
a developing country, but, since you can-
not do without an army in the times we
live in, the task is to ensure that the
officers and men are integrated into the
Government and party so that they be-
come no more of a risk than, say, the
civil service.
“Then, too, we must live with the
situation that we have inherited. The
Chinese, the Russians, and the East
Germans are already in Zanzibar. In
time there will be no foreign military
elements in our republic at all, but that
will only happen after we have been
able to train our own army.”
The President then asked, “Why
should people say we should be afraid
of being unduly influenced by the Chi-
nese, but not by West Germany? Yet
our agreement with the Chinese is for
only six months, whereas our agreement
with West Germany is for five years.”
He added that it was ridiculous to
suggest that the policy he is following in
training his army shows a new orienta-
tion towards the Chinese, the Russians
or the Germans. “Our position remains
what it has always been. We are trying
to be non-aligned. We live in a complex
world in which, try as we will, we are
not going to be left alone. Our task,
therefore, is to take account of all the
complexities and not only of some of
them.
“If only those who like to think of
themselves as our friends would under-
stand this need, and would show greater
faith in our ability to look after our-
selves, we would have much less reason
to be afraid of the future.
“I know that many people will not
like what we are doing. I cannot
honestly pretend that I like it any bet-
ter, that we should be subjected to the
need of balancing one set of facts against
another in order to get the kind of aid
we need to achieve the sort of army that
will meet the requirements of our
united republic. lam confident that we
are going to succeed without losing either
our faith in ourselves or the faith of our
true friends.” (ofns)


Around Melbourne
THE WEEK OF THE GREAT WHITE FLEET
US Information Service sent us
around a note to advise that the
visit by the American warships was
the first official world cruise of its
kind since the arrival of the “Great
White Fleet” in 1908. Oh, dear reader,
how dare they mention the two events
in the same breath? Many of us still
feel that the visit of 16 American
battleships under Admiral Sperry was
the finest thing that ever happened to
Melbourne; definitely it had a clear
edge over the visit of the Duke and
Duchess of Cornwall in 1901.
Just before the fleet appeared off
the heads on August 29 Melbourne
“Punch” reported that Melbourne was
full; never before in her history had
she been so full; wherever one person
could be packed away in comfort
three persons were sleeping. “Punch”
felt that this really would be the apex
of the tour. After all, Sydney hadn’t
always done the right thing. It was
shameful, the number of people who
had stolen the Admiral’s spoons for
mementoes, and this was done not by
the “ignorant, untrained poor, who
are not taught the nicer points of
moral conduct, but by the upper crust,
representatives of the best families”.
The decorations and illuminations
of “Marvellous Melbourne” were
beautiful beyond belief. There were
six curtain arches across Elizabeth
Street. Across Flinders Street station
there was a superb arch with an illu-
minated picture depicting the battle-
ships. The public buildings were illu-
minated with 60,000 incandescent
bulbs. Commonwealth Parliament
House had a great electric sign: AUS-
TRALIA WELCOMES AMERICA.
Before dawn on August 29, 20,000
people were at Queenscliff and Point
Nepean, waiting. Your pioneer, per-
sonally, was not there, but judging
from the photographs in all the news-
paper souvenir supplements the 16
white battleships sailing through in line
astern were really something to see.
The grandest of them all was USS
Connecticut , 16,000 tons, 74 guns,
18.8 knots, 41 officers and 815 men.
The big day, though, was Monday,
August 31, for the six-mile march-
past by the US sailors through the
city. People sat up all night to get
positions. Melbourne’s population was
just over 500,000, but the railways
alone reported that they carried
400,000 that day and the crush in the
city was well over half a million.
Then, with the excitement and
hysteria, people began to faint. The
Army brought in 200 doctors from the
Medical Corps. Casualty clearing
stations were set up at the Town Hall,
Princes Bridge station, Flinders Street
station, the GPO, Exhibition Building
and Parliament House. At the Town
Hall 155 cases were treated; why, 17
ladies even had to be stretched out in
the bars of the Port Phillip Hotel. We
still feel that the numbers who fainted
for the Beatles fell far short of the
numbers who keeled over for the
White Fleet.
The entertainments went non-stop
for days and days. The Freemasons,
His Worship the Mayor of Prahran,
the city newsboys, the Royal Yacht
Club, the City of Melbourne, all
threw big entertainments. Even the
Melbourne Club turned on a dinner
party “for senior officers of the fleet”.
"Out of all the events, clearly the
most memorable was the party for
the petty officers and ratings thrown
by the Commonwealth Government
at the Exhibition Building. A staff of
130 worked all the Wednesday night
and all the Thursday to get everything
ready. At 7 p.m. the tables were set,
200 dozen bottles of beer were al-
ready opened and 100 waiters were
standing by. The host, the Prime
Minister of Australia (Mr Deakin),
was standing by the door.
By 7.30 p.m. all the tables were still
empty, and the PM was sitting down
gloomily reading the papers. Then it
was remembered that for dinner at
the Town Hall on Wednesday 1500
were invited and only 400 turned up.
Maybe they had confused the nights.
Then suddenly there was good news.
One American sailor, plump and
young, was outside, too frightened to
come in. Smartly he was advised that
the Prime Minister of the Common-
wealth, 2500 dinners, and a demon-
stration by the Melbourne Fire Bri-
gade were waiting for him inside.
“Guess not,” said he. “I’d have to
respond, never was an orator.”
The “Argus” man interviewed the
sailor, who said: “Look, I just come
up here to meet a shipmate. We don’t
want food, see. Food's cheap. Tell
y’what. Them boys is walkin’ the girls
round town.”
That seemed to be the end. Mr
Deakin, taking it very well, went home
at 8.45 p.m., whereupon the Army,
Fire Brigade, and all available police
were called in to clean up the 2500
dinners and beer. One man had six
feeds, according to the “Argus”.
And so it went on. There was a
march-past of the US marines and
16,000 Australian cadets, plus the
Light Horse, at Flemington which
drew a crowd of nigh on 100,000. Ad-
miral Sperry celebrated his 63rd birth-
day, whereupon Sir Thomas Bent, our
Premier, presented him with a massive
silver rose bowl on behalf of the
citizens of Victoria. Then for Mrs
Sperry there was a set of silver after-
noon tea spoons, which, if the
“Argus” can be believed, carried not
only views of Melbourne city build-
ings, but each spoon had on the
handles the imperial, Australian and
City of Melbourne coat of arms, plus
effigies of kangaroos and an Abo-
riginal.
The ships departed early on Satur-
day, September 5, but so many were
left behind that the battleship Kansas
had to stay another day. From four
ships alone 141 men were missing,
and the Navy offered rewards of five
to ten dollars a man.
The “Argus” reported that there
were heart-rending scenes at Carlton
police station as the stragglers were
brought in. “Each Jacky,” said the
“Argus”, “was being hugged and
kissed by half a dozen girls. There
were tears, Jackies were being urged
to come back and see us again.”
Gee, Jacky, it’s been a long time.

FORUM
Menzies on Universities
Academic freedom and the law
Far too many people in our country,
when they urge the creation of a
new university, seem to think of
it in terms of financial provision by
governments, and the bricks and mortar
of practical construction. Yet the fact
is that the value of a university depends
primarily upon the standard of its re-
search and its teaching. In short, the
greatest problem about the expansion of
universities is that of securing a highly
qualified staff.
I believe that before we become too
rhapsodical about the increase in num-
bers and the rights of people to have
university training, we should face up
to the problem that the greatest task, and
in a sense the most difficult one, is to
find the necessary trained and compe-
tent staff. There was a time when quite
a number of professors and lecturers
came from overseas. That time has
come to an end. We must, as never
before, generate in our universities our
own future staff.
is to be seen as a faculty
enjoyed by all citizens, not because
they are academic or because they con-
duct a newspaper, but because they are
citizens. The freedom of the Press, for
example, like yours or mine, is a free-
dom within the law. It is subject to all
the legal rules relating to defamation
or sedition or violation of the criminal
codes. A rich private citizen achieves
no new or special freedom when he
purchases a newspaper and controls its
policy and utterances. Similarly, a bar-
rister practising his profession at the
Bar and enjoying the normal freedom
of mankind and the special legal privi-
lege which attaches to what he says in
court, does not acquire a new body of
either freedom or privilege if he be-
comes a Professor of Law at a univer-
sity. It is, I think, well to remember
some of these basic truths.
T'he whole matter (of academic free-
dom) has been somewhat confused for
Australian minds, I venture to think, by
the great masses of litigation and debate
which have occurred in the United States,
the reasons for which are, as I will point
out later, largely peculiar to the United
States. But before I come to that let me
consider what the position is under our
own legal system and that of England.
I will give one example; the famous trial
of Thomas Paine, the author of “The
Rights of Man”. He was, in the course
of that trial (a strange trial, for the
defendant was not present, and a
stranger trial because a hand-picked jury
had been, in fact, bribed to produce a
verdict of guilty), defended by Thomas
Erskine. This, I hasten to say, was be-
fore Erskine succumbed to those ambi-
tions which led him to the House of
Lords; before he had entered into that
process of deterioration in which he rose
in favor but fell in grace. But his speech
in defence of Thomas Paine remains a
classic. He did not attack the law, for
Excerpts from the Prime Minister’s
recent Inaugural Wallace Wurth
Memorial Lecture at the University
of New South Wales.
that would have been futile. He did
not claim that Paine, as a thinker and
writer, had some special immunity from
the law. On the contrary, he said this:
“If I were to ask you, Gentlemen of
the Jury, what is the choicest fruit that
grows upon the tree of English liberty,
you would answer SECURITY UNDER
THE LAW. If I were to ask the
whole people of England the return they
look for at the hands of the Government,
for the burdens under which they bend
to support it, I should still be answered
SECURITY UNDER THE LAW.”
The whole basis of this famous pas-
sage was that Paine’s freedom to write
was consistent with, and protected by,
the law; not that it was superior to the
law.
freedom of the enquiring mind in
"*■ a university is of vital importance,
not only for contemporary society, but
for a developing future. For this reason
it is important that academic people
should not set their claims too high, so
that they appear to be claiming privi-
leges unrecognised by the law. But
they certainly should, in their university
community life, insist, within the law,
upon the maintenance of the freedom
of their minds; and should at all times
resist unauthorised political interference
with their work, or administrative pro-
cedures within the university itself which
could frustrate them in the kind of work
they are in a university to do.
Interestingly enough, there has been
a good deal of debate in the United
States about the position of a practising
Communist in a university. Some
responsible and liberal-minded people
have queried the employment of prac-
tising Communists in a university for
the intelligible reason that the whole
philosophy of Communism and the
whole discipline of the Party are opposed
to that complete freedom of thought and
objectivity of mind which it is one of
the functions of a university to maintain.
I will not try to pursue that argument to
its conclusion, because the boundary
line is very hard to define.
/\ne other matter that has engaged a
good deal of attention in the
United States is the problem of the
tenure of members of university staffs.
There can be no doubt that professors
or lecturers appointed at will could be
much more liable to executive interfer-
ence or pressure than those who are
appointed for a substantial term. Even
those appointed for a term of years

may find themselves complaining that a
failure to renew their appointment at the
end of their term has been due to some
objection to their exercise of their acade-
mic freedom. These are, of course, very
important matters. I, for one, would
offer my own view that an academic
appointed after due consideration should
not feel himself to be at the risk of arbi-
trary treatment if his enquiries lead him
to conclusions which are, in some quar-
ters, unpopular. But it still remains true
that, whether the staff member has a
fixed short or long term or no term at
all, the rules which control the right of
the university to dismiss him are the
same as the rules that apply in any con-
tract of employment, and that, if he is
dismissed without notice, the onus will,
as in any other case, be on his employer,
the university, to justify in law the action
that has been taken.
T%e point that I want to emphasise,
A though it ought to be trite enough,
is that in America itself, with its special
constitutional provisions, the guaranteed
freedoms belong to the community as a
whole, and are not in some particular or
exclusive way sectional privileges outside
the law. It is one of the glories of a
civilised democracy that we enjoy our
freedoms in common; that we are born
with those freedoms, and that they can
be limited or taken away only by the
principles of the common law or by
constitutionally competent statutory pro-
visions made by Parliament. In the
absence of specific legal provisions, no
man may claim a greater freedom than
another.
T would venture to say that a professor
or lecturer at a university is an em-
ployee of the university acting through
its governing body, and that, as an em-
ployee he is subject to the normal rules
relating to master and servant, to dis-
missal without notice if his employer
can prove good cause, and to all the risks
of not being re-appointed if his original
appointment has been for a specific term.
To deny this proposition would be to
say that he is taken out of the usual
Common Law relating to master and
servant and put into a category which is
above the law or which is subject to no
law. This is not a tenable proposition.
I hasten to add that any university
which treated a professor or lecturer as
if he was just a man hired to study as
directed and to teach in accordance with
rules laid down by other people, would
be an extremely strange university; it
would have failed to understand the im-
mense importance of true academic
freedom.

REVIEWS
ART
The Fashion in Abstracts
Paintings in the art-world merry-go-round
BY JOHN HENSHAW
Transfield Art Prize 1964. David
Jones’ Art Gallery, Sydney.
Louis James. Von Bertouch Galleries,
Newcastle.
"Deduced from over 100 entries to 23,
this year’s Transfield prize exhibition
is strikingly similar to that shown at
the same gallery for the W. D. and H. O.
Wills prize a few weeks ago. Figurative
art is mainly “out” in both cases: one
wonders if only certain names get in
or if good work is simply rejected be-
cause it is not instant, fashionable, cur-
rent or what have you. Such is the
occupational disease of the competitive
merry-go-round. One hopes that the
entry will never become what it tends
to be in England now, in certain com-
petitions, a required “basic design”
exercise. As one critic has pointed out,
the abstract may only attempt a very
limited range, the rejected figurative
work much more.
This year’s exhibition achieves a good
standard, though, and there can be no
quibble about its excellent hanging.
Winner Fred Williams displays a
solid example of his You Yang themes
which makes a fine impression in this
company, mixed though it is. Hector
Gilliland, unlike Williams whose entry
is not necessarily one of the very best
he has done, has never seemed more
assured, having drawn some of the
breadth of US abstract expressionism
into a strongly, developed, untitled, tan
and blue-grey oil painting.
Recently deceased pioneer Ralph
Balson’s abstract regains much of his
keen chromatic vibrato. It has an Indian
summer sense of exhilaration which will
be greatly missed in the future. Louis
James is represented by a typically en-
chanted, richly controlled piece, “East of
Moon,” while Mervyn Moriarty reflects
some of the attractive qualities of his
native Queensland in terms of high
pitched color.
Dickerson regains the edge of his most
interesting period in a three-figure melan-
choly “Greek Club”, and, more to the
moment with “Pop”, Reinhard peeps
down wittily on to a seance table with
pairs of hands, all rather too gay to be
spooky. Watkins has screened enamel
through silk to create a box with stripes
reminiscent of the English Cohen. Tom
Gleghorn leans towards the Pompeian
walls of Tapies, without the Spaniard's
solemn gravity, but wielding an impres-
sive command of thick textures. Carl
Plate is excellently aware of spatial
qualities in “August 1964,” while others,
Grey-Smith, Oom, Stan de Teliga rise to
the occasion with representative paint-
ings.
This welcome return showing of Louis
James is his first after 15 years in Lon-
don. Over the years his growing concern
with imagery has enabled a fusion with
purely abstract qualities of color, line,
amid a profusion of textural detail. Each
square inch of canvas or paper becomes
an essential variant in a mosaic of
carefully modulated paint surface, from
the smoothly enamelled light reflecting
to the densely trowelled. Over this the
line p'ays, calling up the edges of a half
remembered head, sections of familiar
objects, or sinking beneath into areas
recalling landscape at vast distances or
seen as close as a pebble held in the
hand. The immediate impression is one
of complex decorative brilliance like
some rich Persian miniature
THEATRE
Swann’s Way
At the Drop of a Hat- Michael Flan-
ders and Donald Swann. Comedy
Theatre, Melbourne.
jl/fELBOURNE theatregoers, more than
most others, love to laugh and hate
to weep. But this does not explain the
triumph of Flanders and Swann, nor the
immediacy of the rapport with their
audience. The show “takes” from the
moment Flanders, like another man who
came to dinner, elegantly rolls himself
on in his shining wheel-chair. From there
to Mr Swann’s last high-piping note
people smile, giggle and laugh and
when it’s all over you hardly know how
it was done.
Informality? Yes, but of a special
kind; more relaxed than any two-man
entertainment we have seen. Good songs?
Well, some are quite brilliant but a few
are just so-so: at least they don’t sparkle
on paper. The patter, maybe? That’s very
good, if you can call it patter, for it’s
the opposite of a funny routine, but
rather the sort of casual wit you expect
to hear from cultured and clever people
in a drawing-room. Perhaps it’s the Eng-
lishness of the thing? For a moment or
two one thinks of Noel Coward, admit-
tedly, but the slant and emphasis are
different. The attack is pitched to a
higher level of intelligence, and from the
first allusion the spectator feels gently
flattered. Flanders and Swann are on the
side of the angels but their satire doesn’t
go beyond a little chanson at de Gaulle’s
expense and the mildly pacifist ditty,
“The Reluctant Cannibal.”
The last few years have seen the art
of the cabaret translated to the large
stage, and this pair mark a high point
in the development. It’s the unexpected-
ness of their technique and of the human
combination, and not the remarkable
nature of the material, which set them
apart. Swann, the composer and pianist,
looks and sounds like what he could well
be, a fourth-year theology student at a
University college. He is the perfect foil
to the slightly Mephistophelean appear-
ance of his more aggressive partner, sup-
porting him only with a few well-timed
grins and questions until, in the second
part, he comes fully into his own and
sco r es a knock-out with “Kokoraki”, a
Greek version of “Old McDougall had
a Farm,” hilariously rendered.
Many of the songs are well known
from records and the first-nighters greet-
ed them as old friends. Familiarity does
not stale numbers like the one that tells
of the misalliance between the 'honey-
suckle and the bind-weed or the magnifi-
cent. mock-rakish “Madeira, M'dear?” In
any case the lead-up is at least as im-
portant as the song. Just a few, a very
few, carefully picked Australian
references for topicality, and for the rest
the diversion is timelessly civilised. It
could be said that it is nothing to get
excited about in the days of “Dr Strange-
love.” But then, this is part of the civil-
isation the Strangeloves would ruin for
us a point gently implied in the mood
and tenor of the whole evening.
The programme was successful in New
York: it would equally succeed in Rio
or Prague; wherever there is the rem-
nant of an educated middle class that
can laugh at itself without rancor. On
the surface unprofessional it is, in fact,
very polished indeed. Everything rests
on calculated understatement, whether
it’s the Commonwealth song, the un-
finished item about an unfinished Opera
House or the happily blathering duet

The Rehearsal. Jean Anouilh. En-
semble Theatre, Sydney.
The Zoo Story. Edward Albee. Palace
Theatre, Sydney.
Rusty Bugles. Sumner Locke Elliott.
Independent Theatre, Sydney.
A producer who could contemplate
staging “The Rehearsal” in the
round is clearly lacking in perception;
so it’s not surprising that the perform-
ance at the Ensemble Theatre goes very
wrong indeed.
Anouilh's play, with its deliberate re-
finement and artificiality, demands con-
ventional staging, the three-sided box
into which the audience looks as if into
a jewel-case.
Anouilh’s play explores a favorite
theme —the collision of innocence and
sophistication. A pleasure-loving Count
is rehearsing a production of a Marivaux
comedy, and upsets his wife, his mistress
and friends by falling for the nursemaid
who has been given a role in the play.
The systematic destruction of their love
by the others (who resent the incursion
of real emotion into their carefully-
ordered lives) is given satirical emphasis
by their elegantly-contrived costumes—
the trappings of artificial comedy.
There is little impression of aristocracy
in the present production. Robin Lawlor
(the Countess) alone approaches the
necessary cool elegance of bearing, and
wears her Marivaux costume with an
air. Bayly looks fresh and
charming as the innocent victim, but
plays the role with unfitting sharpness.
The rest are far too hearty.
Edward Albee’s “The Zoo Story”
already displayed the remarkable, alarm-
ing talent which has come to maturity in
“Who’s Afraid of Virginia Woolf?”
Already, though it is not fully developed,
Albee shows his unerring ear for dia-
logue, his sudden, shocking flashes of
insight.
The play sets a slow fuse which at
last explodes when the two characters,
each insulated from reality (one by his
nice, safe conformity, the other by his
own solitude) finally break from their
self-constructed armor to meet in a de-
cisive, destructive gesture.
Richard Meikle is credible and some-
times moving as the lonely outcast. Glen
Farmer has the less showy role, but
manages to establish the character, with
a nicely graduated progression from
embarrassment to fear and finally pri-
mitive rage. Robin Lovejoy directs the
play with unobtrusive neatness.
To celebrate its 25th anniversary in
its North Sydney theatre the Indepen-
dent Theatre presents a return season of
Sumner Locke Elliott’s play, “Rusty
Bugles”, which had its premiers in 1948.
The original production had a suc-
ces de scandale when it aroused the ire
of Mr Baddeley, then Chief Secretary.
But the men in the play (though young,
lusty and cut off from any companionship
but their own) only indulge in bad
language and mildly erotic reminiscence
and anticipation.
The present workmanlike production
shows that the play (after an uneasy
first scene in which the playwright ex-
plains who his characters are and what
they're doing there) stands up well to
the passing of time. Set in a Northern
Territory ordnance depot, it gives a
compassionate picture of the non-heroic
side of war, whose safe dullness can
literally drive a man mad.

MUSIC
Sculthorpe's
Sonata
Sonata for Violin and Percussion.
Peter Seulthorpe. ISCM Concert,
Sydney.
Trio di Trieste and Musica Viva con-
certs, Sydney.
T\espite its unusual instrumentation,
Peter Sculthorpe’s Sonata for Viola
and Percussion, given its first Australian
performance at a recent ISCM concert,
is, in other respects, a fairly conservative
work. Firmly grounded in the key of C,
a fact which Seulthorpe underlines with
occasional pizzicati on the C string, its
melodic and rhythmic material is “tradi-
tional” in cast.
In some ways, the sonata is a dis-
appointing work. In confining himself
mostly to instruments that were standard
in the orchestra in the latter half of the
nineteenth century and leaving out such
instruments as the whip, castanets, mara-
cas, the Chinese block, high pitched
cymbals and drums, and the high-hat
cymbals, and by not making use of the
techniques that have been developed in
recent years (especially in jazz), Scul-
thorpe seems to have imposed a self-
limitation which, in the event, is not
musically justified.
Some fine passages—for instance, a
rising melody that occurs almost at the
beginning—are offset by others that run
close to banality (the rhythmic figure
with which the work opens). Despite its
success overseas, this is not a work
which is likely to add to Sculthorpe’s
reputation.
One of the highlights of the Trio di
Trieste’s two recent concerts was, oddly,
a piano duet, Schubert’s F Minor Fan-
tasy, played by Maureen Jones and the
group’s pianist Dario De Rosa. Despite
the fact that both pianists tended to
secure clarity of articulation at the
expense of warmth of tone, their team
work and their sympathy for the music
made this work stand out in two pro-
grammes that were of consistently high
quality. While in Sydney, Miss Jones
also appeared in a concert with former
fellow-members of a Musica Viva group
that disbanded 13 years ago. The other
players included violist Robert Pikler
and cellist Lois Simpson, whose presence
helped make this an outstanding concert,
and underlined once more the need for
players of their calibre to be given more
free time from orchestral duties than is
the case at present.

npHE late Edith Piaf’s voice always was
musicianly, even when- huskily deep
and in those many passages of strident
harshness where high notes were accen-
tuated. This RCA collection is vintage
Piaf, the “Little Sparrow’s” voice fresher,
more tender and more delicately plain-
tive than on her Columbia album. In the
former are “La Vie en Rose”, “Sophie”,
“Une Chanson a Trois Temps”, “Amour
du Mois de Mai” and “Le Geste” which
I find most appealing. In the La Reine
de la Chanson collection she sings, ex-
cept for two numbers, Charles Dumont
compositions, aggressively sad and tor-
tured by love: “Les Mots d’Amour”,
“Toujours Aimer” and eight other songs.
“Les Amants de Teruel” and “Quatorze
Juillet” were written by Mikis Theodo-
rakis and lyricist Jacques Plante and are
taken from the score from the film “Les
Amants de Teruel”. Altogether there are
26 songs on the two recordings; the
popular “Milord” is for some reason
not included.
Buddy Holly’s untimely death in 1959
came near the end of the Rock ’n’ Roll
boom. His recordings are in demand
again and this Coral release could be
his most popular. Although his voice is
a little weaker, or thinner, than Presley’s
his pronunciation is more intelligible.

Fireballs, there is some 18-carat Rock

An uncut “Lohengrin” on records —
which means about three solid hours
of sometimes too-solid music, without the
stage pageantry to beguile the eye—may
not be everyone’s joy. But for those who
are game there could hardly be a more
devoted, authoritative and technically
superb interpretation than that given
here under Kempe.
It is a cogently persuasive, almost in-
sidious performance. It not only makes
the most of the undeniably lovely and
dramatically effective passages embedded
in the score; the sensuous richness of the
orchestral playing and the quality and
conviction of the singing almost lulls
the listener into willing acceptance of
the long, dramatically static dialogues
and monologues and the trudging,
square-cut musical metres.
Fischer-Dieskau and Christa Ludwig
as the conspiring Telramunds stand out
even in this strong team of principals;
their scene together at the opening of
Act II is the most forceful and emotion-
ally communicative in the performance.
American Jess Thomas is a strong and
stylish Lohengrin; Elizabeth Griimmer
brings out the passive innocence of
Elsa, though vocally she is the least
reliable of the principals—her top notes
are sometimes a trifle unsteady, especially
in her first scene. Gottlob Frick is a
resonantly dignified Henry the Fowler,
Kempe’s dramatic sense and pains,
taking attention to detail combine to
give new freshness to many too-familiar
passages; even the much-abused Bridal
Chorus provides, at its hushed entry, a
moment of true wonder.
Mahler’s fifth symphony is in many
ways a more theatrical composition than
“Lohengrin,” and Bernstein’s interpre-
tation of it does nothing to diminish its
theatricality. The performance, a bril-
liant piece of playing and recording,
makes the most of all the rhetorical
contrasts, the outburst of lamentation
and exuberance, the touches of sardonic
humor and the typically hard-edged
quality of Mahler’s orchestration. It is
an exciting interpretation, true to a good
deal of Mahler’s complex personality,
though it lacks some of the warmth and
deeper affection perceptible in Bruno
Walter’s Mahler.
In the “Songs on the Death of Child-
ren,” which occupy the fourth side in
this set, the presence of words (pretty
mawkish words, some of them, if one
separates them from the poignant music)
and the profound artistry of Jennie
Tourel induce a richer feeling of human-
ity. Tourel's voice is not always sen-
suously appealing—the very intensity of
her interpretation seems to over-color
her tone —but her feeling for the music
and its mood is impelling.
After the prolixity of Wagner and
Mahler, Stravinsky’s “Symphony of
Psalms” comes like the musical equiva-
lent of one of those compressed stars
called White Dwarfs which have small
bulk but enormous specific gravity. The
whole work is no longer than Mahler’s
third movement, but it would be a grave
mistake to relate its value to its size.
This austere, economical and music-
ally gripping setting of (Latin) words
from the Psalms for four-part chorus and
an orchestra without violins or violas is
arguably the finest work of Stravinsky’s
between-wars period (it dates from 1930).
In my view it stands well above “Oedipus
Rex,” the other main “big” work of this
period, for its consistent matching of
style and content.
The playing, both in the “Symphony
of Psalms” and the engagingly light-
hearted Symphony in C (1939) on the
other side, is excellent—clean and taut,
and marked throughout by Stravinsky's
impeccable rhythmic sense.
Since this recording belongs to the
series of “definitive” versions that Stra-
vinsky is providing for the guidance of
future interpreters it is interesting to
note that the “new revised” 1948 version
of the “Symphony of Psalms” does not
mark the end of the process of revision;
Stravinsky ignores the dynamic markings
in the score at several points.

The Conflicts of an
Irish Genius
Sean O’Casey’s struggle for greatness
By R. G. GEERING
Sean O’Casey. Saros Cowasjee. Oliver
and Boyd. 51s.
This book, by an Indian scholar, is the
second in a series “Biography and
Criticism'’ edited by A. Norman Jeffares
an d R. L. C. Lorimer. Its sub-
title is “The Man Behind the Plays”;
Cowasjee's purpose, to quote from his
preface, is “to show the author's life,
purpose and convictions in relation to
his work as a dramatist”. Only by adopt-
ing a biographical approach, he believes,
can we discover where and why O'Casey
succeeds and fails and this because
O’Casey is “one whose life is to an ex-
traordinary degree interwoven with his
writings”. This last notion is, I suspect,
the one arrived at by most critics who
make an exhaustive study of any writer
the more the critic finds out about his
man the easier it is to establish links be-
tween life and works and to offer plaus-
ible explanations for the writings. This
is all very well so long as the biographical
why is not called upon to supplant liter-
ary judgment.
With O'Casey the approach adopted
‘here pays off handsomely in the first
half of the book, mainly because
O'Casey’s early life in Dublin is in itself
a fascinating story of a struggle against
illness and poverty, a desire for know-
ledge and a role in public affairs, and a
determination to make good as a writer.
Cowasjee devotes Chapters I and 111 to
this part of the story, which ends in 1926
when O'Casey goes into “exile” in Lon-
- don; his second chapter deals with the
Abbey plays “The Shadow of a Gun-
man”, “Juno and the Paycock”, and
‘The Plough and the Stars”. This is the
f best part of the book and it is very good
indeed. The relationship between the
early plays and the Dublin life of the
I Period is well handled; so, too, is the
account of O’Casey's dealings with Yeats,
Lady Gregory and the Abbey Theatre.
From this base Cowasjee makes an ex-
[ kemely illuminating analysis of the plays
themselves, which are treated (despite
the rather different impression we might
draw from the preface) not only as
social and biographical documents but
also as works of literature in their own
right.
These are the formative years and the
material is such as to lend itself to the
biographical - critical approach. There-
after, the life story offers little of special
interest, apart from the bitter controversy
started by Yeats's well-intentioned but
rather high-handed rejection of O'Casey’s
anti-war play “The Silver Tassie”, to
which the whole of Chapter IV is given.
The second half of the book deals with
what are called the “exile plays”, the
one-acters, and the more openly political
dramas, “The Star Turns Red” and “Red
Roses for Me”; and this part, it must be
said, is not nearly as good.
11/fosT of O'Casey’s dramatic work after
1?1 1926 is the product of a writer
whose roots are still in his homeland
and, apart from the expressionistic
“Within the Gates”, the best of it
continues to draw upon Irish char-
acters and situations (with consider-
able repetition) and to reflect his
ever-growing preoccupation with the life-
denying forces within the churches. De-
prived of the kind of biographical mat-
erial which enables him to draw detailed
and meaningful parallels between
O’Casey's life and his works, Cowasjee
does what he can here to preserve the ap-
proach of the early chapters, but this
often takes the form of justifying
O’Casey’s political and religious attitudes
so that, notably in the chapter “O'Casey
and Communism”, we get a good deal of
special pleading. We are told again and
again that O'Casey is not really anti-
religious or even anti-Catholic, and that
his Communism springs from his com-
passion for suffering humanity. We are
told, too, that “O’Casey has indeed woven
God and Communism very successfully
together and served the cause of the
workers well”. And we are, presumably,
expected to find illumination and hope
from remarks such as these:
“O’Casey’s solution is that once the
false God of the existing Church is
displaced, the true God of the people
must take its place. And Communists
have nothing to fear, but march (sic)
hand in hand with God, for is not
Communism the promised kingdom?
In saying so much O’Casey has done
a splendid service to Communism, if
only all Communists would see it.”
For sheer naivety this would be hard
to beat.
It would be wrong to say that Cowas-
jee overlooks the weaknesses caused by
the crude propaganda element in a play
like “The Star Turns Red”, but having
made the obvious criticisms he gives the
impression that he wants to withdraw
them because O'Casey is, after all, our
greatest living dramatist. This sort of
shuffling (which a reader might take to
be an indication of academic caution
and fairness) affects the critical value of
the book. By the time O'Casey came to
write “Red Roses for Me” we are told
that he had discarded his earlier pacifism
(reflected in the Abbey plays) for the
belief that one must fight for one’s rights.
This Cowasjee calls a positive develop-
ment in O'Casey’s outlook. “The cyni-
cism of his early plays has been replaced
in his later ones by a vision of hope for
the future.” This may be so, but it doesn’t
alter the fact that “Juno and the Pay-
cock” and “The Plough and the Stars”
remain (to say the very least) two of the
best plays he ever wrote. The biographi-
cal trap lies wide open here; “cynicism”
is a dangerous over-simplification of the
Abbey plays.
Chapter VI ends on an unconvincing
note. Whatever the faults of “Red Roses
for Me” it still remains a fine play be-
cause what it lacks in dramatic intensity
“is more than compensated for by the
richness of its language, music, songs and
dances, all of which O’Casey uses to ad-
vance his theme”. The treatment of the
“exile” plays, particularly their religious
aspects, is in a similar apologetic vein.
“The Bishop’s Bonfire” is anti-clerical
but not anti-religious. “O'Casey is not
against praying as such, but against ex-
cessive formal prayer”. We might well
ask what this continually, recurring kind
of comment contributes to our under-
standing of the plays.
Much patient work has gone into


this carefully documented study and even
the disappointing second half is valuable
for the pros and cons it puts in front of
us. Cowasjee draws freely upon the
volumes of O'Casey’s autobiography and
from certain unpublished material housed
in the Dublin National Library. This
book does not include in its long biblio-
graphy the titles of two other full-length
studies of O'Casey, viz., “The Experi-
ments of Sean O'Casey”, by Robert
Hogan, and “Sean O’Casey: The Man
and His Work”, by David Krause (both
1960). Good as Cowasjee's early chap-
ters are, I should rate Krause's book the
best of the three.

Boyd. 58s. 6d.
“IZ ipling’s Mind and Art” is a collec-
tion of 11 essays. Four are general
assessments of the writer and his work;
three discuss Kipling’s “philosophy”; and
four are closer and more detailed studies
of specific works and kinds of work. The
four general studies have all been avail-
able for some time. W. L. Renwick’s
obituary lecture is the least distinguished
of them. The essays of Edmund Wilson,
George Orwell and Lionel Trilling are
well known and although all three are
now more than twenty years old, they
stand up well to reconsideration. Some
of Edmund Wilson’s biographical and
psychological speculations may seem less
likely in the light of more recent infor-
mation about Kipling’s life, but his sur-
vey of the development of the writing,
from the brilliant stories of the precoci-
ous sub-editor of the Lahore newspaper,
through the less acceptable imperial
period of middle life, to the powerful
stories of distress and near madness of
the nineteen-twenties and ’thirties is ex-
cellent. It finds exactly the virtues of a
patient and expert craftsman in writing,
and the damaging limitations of a sensi-
bility that almost always turned away
from the pain and danger of examining
its own deepest problems.
George Orwell’s study is less sympa-
thetic, but it has the insight as well as the
animus that comes from close under-
standing. Orwell had much in common
with Kipling; birth in India, the impover-
ished but status-proud middle class back-
ground, the experience in the Burma
police, and the appalling schooldays
recorded by Orwell in “Such, Such Were
the Joys”, an article that the libel laws
have so far withheld from publication
outside America. The likeness extends
beyond experience: both approved un-
fashionable virtues like physical courage
and loyalty, both carry impatience with
the parlor-intellectual to a point (though
Kipling went much further) well inside
philistine territory. Orwell defends Kip-
ling for his sense of responsibility and
for his lack of illusion about power and
violence. Trilling’s essay is slighter, but
it begins where almost all appreciation of
Kipling begins, with the recognition that
the children's books are very good in-
deed. His remark of “The Jungle Books”
that “It is not too much to say that a
boy had thus his first introduction to a
generalised notion of society” could serve
as a text to Noel Annan’s essay in this
volume on “Kipling’s Place in the History
of Ideas”, which sees Kipling as “the
sole analogue in England to those Conti-
nental sociologists Durkheim, Weber,
and Pareto who revolutionised the
study of sociology at the beginning of
this century”. This is a most stimulating
article, but perhaps the case for Kipling’s
objective view of the societies he presents
is argued too far. It seems to me, for ex-
ample, that the return of the Lama to
help Kim or the descent of the holy
man to warn the village in “The Miracle
of Purun Bhagat”, both imply a rejection
of the Indian way of withdrawal in favor
of European activism, and a consequent
judgment of value in favor of the latter.
The other two articles in the section
on Kipling’s “philosophy”, by George
Shepperson and Alan Sandison, both
make clear the falseness and limitation
of the popular view of Kipling as the
propagandist for the crudest kind of im-
perialism.
In the final section I liked particularly
Andrew Rutherford’s “Officers and
Gentlemen”, a sensitive examination of
Kipling’s treatment of the military vir-
tues. The admirable story of the centu-
rion Parnesius in “Puck of Pook’s Hill'’
is contrasted with the less satisfying army
stories with a contemporary setting to the
enlightenment of both. But all four of
the essays in this section provide fresh
understanding of the stories they discuss
and of the strengths and limitations of
Kipling’s art.
Time, that with this strange excuse,
Pardoned Kipling and his views,
And will pardon Paul Claudel,
Pardons him for writing well.
Auden’s comment in his poem on the
death of W. B. Yeats is true. Yeats, in-
deed, was “silly like us”, but his poetry
rises from the bric-a-brac of esoteric
philosophy that surrounds it like a firm
building from a clutter of scaffolding.
His outlook is generous, and his attitude,
without strain or posturing, heroic. We
are never faced with the need to disen-
tangle our admiration for the literary
skill from our dislike or our discomfort
at the attitudes that skilful writing em-
bodies. With Kipling we meet this pro-
blem again and again. “Stalky and Co.”
creates with absolute veracity its second-
rate English Public School, in all its
anti-intellectual snobbish brutality, and
presents it with approval. In his last
collection, “Limits and Renewals”, there
is a story where grown men revert to the
schoolboy rituals of sadism to punish a
“rotter”. In the stories about adult life
there is the fascination with elite “in-
groups” Mithraists, Freemasons, the
initiates of an art or craft, or the mem-
bers of an alien ruling class. In his essay
in this volume, “Vision in Kipling’s
Novels”, Mark Kinkead-Weekes brings
out well the excessive concentration on
physical pain inflicted and suffered
in “The Light that Failed”. But when all
reservations have been made, Kipling still
exists as one of the major writers of his
period, and “Kipling's Mind and Art”
does much to show why.

The Tailor and Ansty. Eric Cross.
Chapman and Hall. 31s.
An Edge of Pride. Deane Narayn.
Chapman and Hall. 225. 6d.
A recent article by Geoffrey Moor-
house in the “Manchester Guardian”
placed Australia close behind Ireland as
the most censor-ridden country in the
English-speaking world. But when we
consider that “The Tailor and Ansty”,
Eric Cross’s unobtrusive little homily on
the virtues of the simple life, was actu-
ally banned in Ireland for being “in its
general tendency indecent” it is hard to
escape the conclusion that we have been
unfairly used in the comparison; beside
this, even our haphazard and parochial
censorship is made to appear the most
enlightened liberalism.
The novel's offence, we learn from
Frank O'Connor’s over-enthusiastic in-
troduction, lay not in the existence of any
purple passages, but in its glorifying of
characters who are “sex-obsessed” (the
tailor) and “a moron with a mental age
of four or five” (Ansty, his wife). When
the book was first introduced in the
early ’forties, a leading member of Ire-
land's Censorship Board suggested in
evidence before the De Valera Govern-
ment that it was “symptomatic of a cam-
paign going on in England and financed
by American money to undermine
Christianity” and Eric Cross's name was
coupled with others such as George
Bernard Shaw’s as agents in the “con-
spiracy to replace the Christian creed
with paganism”.
It is difficult to believe that any
government, even one composed in
Mr O’Connor’s phrase of a “prize col-
lection of halfwits”, could really have
believed such things of this book; more
likely their true motivation was that

“Xhe Tailor and Ansty”, which was an
Account of the life of an actual couple,
was a mirror reflecting all too accurately
Ithe lives and beliefs of a great many
j r ish peasants at a time when the
'Government was anxious to present a
different face to the world.
The Tailor and his wife Anastasia,
.retaining in their old age the enthusiasms
and many of the beliefs of children, are
the epitome of the popular conception
of the Irish, at once simply happy, en-
gaging, mischievous and warm-hearted.
The Tailor, continually holding court
with friends boasting such redolently
Irish names as Cork Echo, The Sheep
and Dan Bedam (so called for his habit
of beginning each sentence with Bedam),
has obviously kissed the Blarney Stone.
His speech is a glossary of quaint Irish
words and phrases and if he does use
an occasional swear-word or tell an off-
color story, it’s all with a Rabelaisian
sense of fun.
In the American South and Middle-
West, the Tailor would be known as a
,cracker-barrel philosopher; the following
offerings sum up his philosophy of life:
“The world is only a blue bag. Knock
a squeeze out of it when you can.”
“Take the world fine and aisy and the
world will take you fine and aisy.”
Another activity which helps fill The
Tailor’s life is listening occasionally to
the BBC, but he is always disappointed
because they devote too much time to
Hitler and the war in Europe and make
no mention of important doings in the
nearby village of Tir Na Og and never
are able to tell him the events that will
happen next day.
Character delineation is such that,
when The Tailor and his Ansty die, we
are in no doubt in which direction they
have gone. There is about the whole
thing an uncomfortable suspicion of a
message on the advantages of the simple
life. Mr Cross leaves no doubt that The
Tailor is The Most Unforgettable
Character He’s Met; certainly he is
eminently suitable for condensation in
‘Reader's Digest”.
“An Edge of Pride” is a must for any-
one in the market for a rare violin, for
if the practices outlined in this expose
of violin dealers really do exist it would
be a great pity to pay forty or fifty
thousand for a Stradivarius or Guar-
nerius without taking advantage of the
fringe benefits available. True lovers of
Violin music should be warned, however,
•hat this inside dope on the violin busi-
ness > if taken seriously, could curdle
•heir future enjoyment of the perform-
ances of Heifetz and Stern.
Apparently being a violin dealer is a
Ver Y exacting business and one which in-
evitably puts a great strain on the ethics
and morals of those who practise it. The
wchard family react to the temptation
0 follow the path to easy riches in a
variety of ways: Old Andre, the patriarch
of the firm (who in a soap-opera touch
has been made blind), still thinks violins
are sold in accordance with their value
as they were in his day; his elder son
Maurice now successfully runs the busi-
ness by using modern methods, including
charming customers into higher prices
through the services of Kay (who also
doubles as a secretary); the younger son,
Guy, comes of age in the music business.
As the protagonist, it is Guy who dis-
covers that there is “an edge of pride in
all of us which makes the cost of betray-
ing our inbred convictions prohibitive”.
Such uplifting sentiments which might
have come straight out of the “Girls’
Own Annual” of half a century ago set
the tone for the whole. It is Deane
Narayn’s first book.
NOEL BUCKLEY
Racing for
the Cup
Sailing For America’s Cup. Everett B.
Morris. Harper and Row. £5.
A merica, the author of this book as-
serts, came perilously close to losing
the America’s Cup in 1962 because the
New York Yacht Club “leant over back-
wards to help Australia put on a good
show”. He points out that the extrusions
from which Grelel’s masts were made
were fabricated in the United States, one
of her booms was fashioned there and
her most effective sails were Yankee-
made. However, he does add that the
Australians amply demonstrated that they
really did not need all that generous
help. Gre tel gave a fine account of her-
self, won one race and might easily have
won others but for the genius of Bus
Mosbacher at the wheel of the defender,
Weatherly.
It is clear that the unsuspected calibre
of G ret el and her crew came as some-
thing of a shock to the Americans. Only
two months after the 1962 races the
America’s Cup trustees adopted a reso-
lution debarring any future challenger
from using American “design facilities”
or buying any masts, sails or other gear
in the United States. Gretel, says Mr
Morris, “will be the last challenger on
which New York will lavish largesse . . .
which means simply this: hereafter for-
eign yachts must be foreign in all re-
spects”. With Australia certain to re-
appear as a contender in the future, and
with other countries (Italian and Swedish
yachtsmen are already reported to be
making plans) likely to enter the tradi-
tional lists between America and Britain,
United States sportsmen can no longer
afford the luxury of too much chivalry.
Certainly the building and entering of
Gretel for the Royal Sydney Yacht


Squadron gave the America's Cup com-
petitiop a much-needed shaking-up. After
World War II the contest seemed com-
pletely moribund. The palmy days ot the
great ocean-going craft skippered by
Cornelius and Harold Vanderbilt, Sir
Thomas Lipton and T. O. M. Sopwith
were over. Changing economic condi-
tions made it impossible for private
sportsmen to finance the 130 ft monsters
with their big professional crews.
“Sailing for America’s Cup” gives
some fascinating details about the yacht-
ing monarchs of that earlier age. Vigil-
ant, for example, carried 70 seamen to
wrestle with more than a quarter-acre of
canvas and her centreboard was weighted
with 77501 b. of concrete. Cornelius
Vanderbilt’s Reliance, the last of the
huge, freakish “skimming dishes”, was
143 feet long and had a beam of 26
feet and a sail area of more than 16,000
square feet. ( Gretel and Weatherly each
carried about 1850 square feet.) As late
as the 1930 s one of Harold Vanderbilt’s
princely yachts carried a “black gang” of
eight professionals who never saw a race;
they were too busy toiling at the winches
below deck. Crews American and
British alike were rigidly divided into
gentlemen and players. There were those
who were invited to dinner at the Ren-
aissance palaces along the Newport
waterfront and those the horny-hand-
ed professionals of New England or the
Solent who were not.
In 1956, when there had been no
America’s Cup races since Vanderbilt’s
Ranger trounced Sopwith’s Endeavour 11
in 1937, the New York Yacht Club, as
holders of the trophy, decided on a re-
volutionary move to revive interest in the
contest. With the agreement of British
yachtsmen, the minimum length of the
yachts was lowered enough to let in the
12-metre craft. These, with their much
smaller and almost entirely amateur
crews, were the most popular blue-water
boats then being sailed. The immediate
result was not encouraging, as the first
British 12-metre contender, Sceptre, was
heavily outclassed by Columbia in the
1958 races. It seemed that no amount of
juggling with the regulations would pro-
duce a serious threat to America’s grip
on the “auld mug”, as Lipton called it.
Then, in 1960, came the challenge by
Gretel and the Royal Sydney Yacht
Squadron. The rest is recent history.
A large part of “Sailing for America’s
Cup” is devoted to the contests between
Gretel and Weatherly in September,
1962. There is a detailed analysis of the
tactics employed in each of the five races
as Jock Sturrock and Bus Mosbacher
struggled to snatch each other’s wind, to
lure the enemy into mistakes and out-
think him in the sudden and crucial deci-
sions that had to be made. There is some
critical observation on the training
methods of G ret el’s crew, but high tri-
bute is paid to the Australians’ physical
condition and their refusal to accept de-
feat until the opponent was across the
finishing line. Much of it is specialist
stuff. But, to the layman, it is also a
revelation of the sheer, back - breaking
hard work that lies behind the romance
of sailing for the America’s Cup.
The book is sumptuously produced
and its illustrations will delight the heart
of any blue-water sailor. Its appearance
on the local market is well-timed, for
next month the United States will once
more defend the “auld mug” on the
bleak Atlantic waters off Newport. The
challenge comes from Britain, but
whether the contender will be Kurrewa
V, built for Britain by the Australian
Livingston brothers, or young millionaire
Tony Boyden’s Sovereign, remains to be
seen. The main thing is that the Ameri-
ca’s Cup contest is thoroughly alive
again. And for that happy state of affairs
Australia can claim a considerable share
of the credit.
GEOFFREY SCOLL
Painting with
Light
The World of Camera. Nelson. 1445.
sumptuous volume, conceived by
the editorial board of “Camera”,
and compiled from the files of that super-
lative Swiss magazine, appears to be the
most exciting survey of the scope of
photography available today.
It covers portraiture, motherhood,
children, man-at-work, war, landscape,
animals, underwater, still-life and the
nude. Then come science with its sub-
heads, antiquity, color micro and macro-
photography, color X-ray, crystals,
snow-crystals, seen by polarised light,
analysis of rapid movements, photo-
elastic isochromats, scientific color, pic-
turing the heavens. Lastly, composition
and technique, abstraction, ends and
means. Perhaps the most miraculous
pictures in the book are the color photo-
graphs of the heavens, taken at the Palo-
mar Observatory. The accompanying
text by William C. Miller, research
photographer for Mt Wilson and Palo-
mar Observatories, explains tersely and
clearly the enormous difficulties encoun-
tered in an undertaking of this kind.
A few pages on, under “abstraction”,
is a full-page color picture by Dennis
Stock of Magnum simply titled “Sun”.
One blade of grass in focus, pale blue
sky, rose pink sun, as subtle and perfect,
as intuitively perceived as a Zen note by
Sesshu. Also under the heading of
“abstraction” are a colored light graph,
colored photogram, stroboscopic experi-
ments in color, and crystal paintings
(color crystallographs), all strongly
reminiscent of the work of abstract
painters, but alive with incredible
subtleties of colored light in a way no
abstract painting ever was. Unfor-
tunately limits of space force the re-
viewer to adopt a synoptic approach,
One can only briefly hint at the riches
that are here.
Ernst Haas (a renegade painter) is
represented, with his magical blurred
bullring and rodeo impressions, a master
of shutter technique, making a sublime
virtue out of what the fumbling amateur
usually does by mistake. Many of the
other illustrious photographers contri-
buting to this book also started as
painters, but gave it away because, one
senses, they discovered they could com-
municate more vitally through the
medium of the camera.
Of course there are still many people
around, anachronistically cranky and
morbid enough to boom and bore: “But
photography is not an art”. They are
recommended to take their prejudices for
a promenade through this gorgeous gal-
lery, and so straighten them out.
Sir John Rothenstein, himself a
painter, says in his introduction to the
book, “Photography is the only authen-
tic folk art of the twentieth century.” Is
this perhaps just a little bit patronising?
Man has been scrawling, scratching
and smearing, sometimes on a god-like
level, for some thousands of years, has
been drawing with light for just over
one hundred years, painting with light
for a mere twenty years. What he has
achieved in his photographic moments
of time, as shown in this book, is surely
a miracle of technology and art.
A personal grouch. Did Lord Snow-
don really merit a place in the book?
And four pictures, no less. A common-
place color snap on the dust wrapper,
a very dull ballet shot, a street-vendor
(you’ve seen it a thousand times), an
unexciting color shot of a cobweb. I can
only assume this was a Swiss courtesy
concession to the English market.
And one bit of Gallic guff: “The body
in its state of natural splendor is the
supreme example of beauty.” From the
essay on “The Nude” by E. Sougez, who
compensates for this with a lovely tender
nude. A more formidable man with
the shutter than with the pen.
The reproductions (51 color plates,
141 black and white plates) are all
superb, with perfect registration and
brilliance in color, and accurate tone and
texture in the monochromes. Printed m
Switzerland by C. J. Bucher Ltd,
Lucerne, the whole production matches
the perfection of the pictures. I recom-
mend the book without reservations to
educationists, public libraries, and any-
one interested in photography, as being
the best survey available today.

BUSINESS AND FINANCE
Imports Need Watching
rtrTHiLE higher interest rates and tighter credit are the
VU order of the day, it will be of interest to see what
” effect the Government-induced measures will have on
spending, particularly when expressed in terms of Australia’s
overseas reserves. Imports are edging up, even under normal
replacement influences, and must have an effect on overseas
funds if not offset by exports and an inflow of capital.
Unfortunately, as so often pointed out by The Bulletin,
the real effect of imports is being camouflaged by the strong
influx of capital and the accumulated profits of overseas com-
panies operating in Australia. There is talk of further Japanese
capital coming to Australia and there have been moves to esta-
blish a Japanese bank in Australia.
Already the payment for certain Australian exports is being
tied to an exchange of goods or the “lease” of specialised
equipment. The true picture of trade, including invisibles,
is being painted over by that omnibus title “Overseas reserves”,
which embraces so many items not related to trade.
The Reserve Bank would be keeping the public better in-
formed by publishing (if possible) an estimate of trade and
capital movements in overseas funds each week, which in many
cases would show that Australia was down on trade but well
up on capital inflow. Over a period, we would be forced to
the realisation that the reserves have been established not by
trade but by borrowings, capital inflow and accumulated
profits of overseas companies.
A Steadier Market
for Zinc
While tin prices in London reached a 13-year peak last
" week, lead and zinc prices have suffered from the inevit-
able reaction which comes from sharp and speculative upward
price movements. Base metal producers are greatly concerned
that high or widely fluctuating prices could influence con-
sumers to seek alternative materials as substitutes.
It is a well-founded fear because of the rapid growth in
substitutes in these days of improved technological achieve-
ments. The best interests of zinc producers are achieved if
a steady and profitable price is maintained, thus ensuring con-
tinuity of orders and permitting the users to plan their usage
a t a fairly stable cost level. Imperial Smelting, of Britain,
recognised this last July when it fixed a contract price of
£stgl2s a ton; a move which was followed smartly by other
Producers anxious to stabilise prices.
The £stg!2s contract price looked reasonable enough when
z inc prices were up near the record of £stgls4 a ton, but
became artificial after spot prices on the open market dropped
to around £stg 110 to £stg 115. The whole purpose of the
hxed contract price was to influence stability at lower prices.
Producers are now expected to consider a new fixed con-
tract price based on long-term contract supplies. The pro-
ducers have indicated they could supply zinc at contract prices
down to £stg9s a ton and they point out that the spot prices
on the London Metals Exchange are more the reflection of
demands for the smaller and marginal requirements of the
trade.
True enough, the speculator or the user caught short of
supplies tends to push the open market price to ridiculous
levels at times, often with repercussions not wanted by the
trade. For example, the US General Services Administration
released more stockpiled metal onto the market when prices
boomed. These releases coincided with fresh supplies to the
market from Canada and a general reluctance of buyers to
move in at the higher levels.
Reports coming from London suggest that peak demand
for zinc has passed and that a more orderly marketing of the
metal should exist in the future at steadier prices.
Realities in Australia-Japan
Trade Relations
<T*he Australia-Japan Business Co-operation Committee meet-
ing in Canberra last week was far from a picnic for
platitudes and mere motions of mutual goodwill. There seemed
a sense of realism about it, with Japan anxious to exploit a
growing market in Australia.
Perhaps the discussions gained a greater actuality from the
overhanging Tariff Board inquiry on the imports of fully-
assembled motor vehicles into Australia. Although the Japan-
ese Government is not expected officially to join the hearings,
many of the visiting businessmen possess a lively feeling of
their importance for the accelerating Japanese export drive.
Australia's Minister for Trade, Mr John McEwen, should
be given a fair measure of credit for keeping proceedings
close to economic realities. He made no attempt to disguise
the wished-for progress of Australian industry.
“We want to sell our minerals and other natural resources
overseas, but we want our country to be something more than
a quarry,” Mr McEwen said forthrightly.
The corollary was soon expressed. “We must look to the
factories to provide the employment that is necessary for
further expansion. At this stage of our development we must
continue to protect and develop our local industries.”
Naturally Australia to be providing Japan with greatly
increased quantities of raw materials. Import demands from
Japan, however, will not be for goods already made in
Australia.
Mr McEwen really laid down the line for genuine co-
operation: to discover the areas where Australia did not
produce (the trading gaps); to examine the possibilities of


long-term contracts (mainly in raw materials, foodstuffs and
sugar); and “to ensure that friction did not arise when it
was avoidable”.
The immediate position, considering the prevailing balance
of trade, cannot quickly become easy, since Japan makes no
secret of her need for a marked uplift in exports. “We cannot
help but seek your co-operation in expanding our trade with
your country,” Mr T. Adachi told the committee
Japan’s apparent principal wish is to increase exports of
heavy machinery and chemicals. So far as Australia is con-
cerned, this must bring her into competition with traditional
suppliers like Britain, Germany and America.
The latest Japanese White Paper on Foreign Trade lends
force to the above-mentioned programme. The nation’s balance
of international payments has to be improved by an expansive
export trade.
Specifically the White Paper argues that it is important to
increase exports of heavy industrial products other than iron,
steel and ships. It is obvious, though, that any trade expansion
is desired by Japan and doubtless she will press this desire
wherever possible.
Overseas Investment: Blessing,
or a Burden?
Overseas companies invested £180.3 million in Australian
companies in 1962-63 plus a further £42.2m. in portfolio
investment, giving a total annual investment inflow of £222.5m.
This total includes £51.8m. of undistributed income.
The inflow was not all gain to Australia’s overseas reserves,
because £76m. was sent overseas again in the form of profits
and dividends. Those dividend commitments are rising each
year. If the flow of capital is reversed (including a repatria-
tion of investment money now
resting in Australian shares,
debentures, etc.), it could rep-
resent a serious blow to Aus-
tralia’s international reserves.
Even without any repatriation
of investment funds, the rising
trend in dividend and profit
commitments could be a stag-
gering burden in a year when
capital inflow stopped. Usually,
overseas investment is on a
long-term basis and funk money
only disappears when political
situations look grim. But it is
as well to recognise that Aus-
tralia is building up a tremen-
dous responsibility with huge
and growing investments from
overseas.
In the 16 years to June, 1963,
(the 1963-64 figures are not yet
available) the cumulative inflow
of private overseas investment
in companies was £1754.4m.,
made up of £1197.8m. in direct
investment and £556.6m. in undistributed income.
Under normal conditions, those overseas companies would
be happy to plough back their undistributed profits each year.
It is a sobering thought to realise, though, that undistributed
profits must be getting up near the total of Australia’s over-
seas reserves.
Australia enjoys the blessing of these overseas companies

Reserve Bank Report 1964.)
which are putting up risk money, developing the country, and
providing jobs. But the time has arrived when the responsi-
bility must be considered, plus the recognition that Australia
seems to be relying too heavily on the overseas source of
funds like an ever-extending overdraft —which never needs
to be repaid.
New World Bank Loan
For India
11/hile the post-Nehru Indian Government is heavily engaged
in coping with a food shortage and the price-inflation
stemming therefrom, the World Bank has decided to make
a positive effort to help the country’s industrial efficiency.
This, equally with the crop situation, has come under con-
siderable criticism.
Much of India’s scarce management skill frequently gets
diverted into complicated efforts to secure the foreign exchange
needed for materials and parts imports. The World Bank
(through its affiliated International Development Association)
in this light examined requirements of the commercial vehicle,
construction equipment and machinery manufacturing indus-
tries.
The result is a £stg3Q million loan, the first ever given by
the World Bank, or IDA, to a developing country not ear-
marked for designated capital projects. The loan will allow
India a year’s supply of components, spare parts and special
steels for the above-mentioned three industries.
The food problem may prove less tractable in the short
run. At present an old expedient is being tried—a request to
America for surplus grain shipments.
The Indian Government is finding it very hard to secure the
diversion of some Britain-bound wheat shipments from Aus-
tralia, presumably as a quick
start to the 75,000 ton credit
purchase arranged towards the
end of August.
Under all the threats of
famine it is hardly surprising
that Prime Minister Shastri
appears to be moving away
from the industrialising bias of
India’s successive five-year
plans. Only last week he re-
marked to an interviewer: “The
strains that have shown up in
recent months cannot be
ignored. I believe the first task
is to provide food, clothing,
shelter and medical aid to
India’s millions. I have, there-
fore, suggested that our econo-
mic planning should be geared
to meeting these primary needs
at the same time as we pursue
other goals.”
Furthermore, Mr Shastri was
compelled to add: “I think
agriculture will have to be given
much geater importance than before. The farm sector is and
will remain for many years, decisive in Indian development.
The goal of Indian self-reliance looks a long, long way
off. Regular overseas investment may perhaps be inhibited by
India’s proclaimed “socialist objectives”. In the meantime Mr
Shastri expresses a hope that the Americans and others “will
continue their support for India.”


EECONOMICS ANONYMOUS
Hard Facts of Commodity Flows
A review of John Britton’s “The Ports of Victoria"
The essences of economic life are so
often obscured by variations in
money values that it is satisfying once
in a while to come across a writer who
hardly mentions money at all in tracing
a patchwork of trade, such as John
Britton in “The Ports of Victoria”, re-
cently published by Melbourne Univer-
sity Press.
it is equally satisfying to find some-
body so absorbed in a subject without a
global or even national twist, whose raw
materials are the earthy substances of
commodity trade, writing about it with-
out pretence, stopping short when his
treatment of the provincial threatened to
lead him to broader horizons, yet suc-
ceeding in getting a romantic weave and
having one asking for more.
Without trying to gild this little lily,
it can be recommended strongly as
essential reading for all those interested
in understanding the workings of Vic-
toria’s economy (if one may dare be so
provincial in a national journal) and also
for those who still dream of decentrali-
sation as offering a quick or even
feasible solution to the problem of popu-
lation growth, be it in that State or else-
where in the Commonwealth. Whether
by design or not, in photographing the
flow of trade in and out of the State’s
three main ports, Britton has also snapped
the physical picture of the economy and
in the process revealed the inevitability
of its high gearing to the State capital.
Focusing behind the ports to their hin-
; terlands, Britton has analysed the
total tonnages of freight handled by the
innumerable station towns up and down
the countryside and imputed to them
ratios comparing their inward and out-
ward rail freight tonnages with the quan-
tities they get from and send to the main
.ports. The ratios express the tonnage
of imports (or exports) for each town
as a proportion of each thousand tons of
total receipts (or despatches).
So, on the various maps provided, one
can see at a glance the relative impor-
tance to the ports of practically every
.sizeable town in the State, and, even more
"flportant, you get a bird's-eye view
°f the tie-ups of the various regions of
the State with the particular ports. These
lna Ps provide excellent pictorial refer-
ee to the ratios • and make the whole
exercise more intelligible.
The tonnage of cargo moving through
Melbourne has increased since the war.
Britton says the rate of increase has been
neither constant nor high. Melbourne's
import and export functions are far more
complex than those of either Portland or
Geelong. Because of the more varied
composition of its traffic and its extremely
large tonnage (in 1960 more than nine
million tons of freight were handled),
the port of Melbourne has wide and com-
plex connections with most facets of
economic life in Victoria. Major forces
affecting the economy of the State (and
of Australia), rather than fluctuating for-
tunes of individual primary and second-
ary industries, are reflected in the ton-
nage of its imports and exports.
study brings out very clearly how
the ports complement as well as
compete against one another. Speciali-
sation is seen in the concentration,
say, of wheat exports from Geelong
(most of the wheat sent from the
country areas to Melbourne ends up
as flour), oats exports from Port-
land, and wool and flour from Mel-
bourne. Competition is seen most clearly
in petroleum, the commodity which do-
minates inward and outward trade of
Melbourne and Geelong and also plays a
big part in the trade of Portland (it
dominates the imports of that port, but
runs a poor third to oats and dairy pro-
ducts in exports).
In fact one of the most fascinating
sides of the story is the rising pre-
eminence of petroleum over coal, though
coal is still the second largest import into
Melbourne and the third biggest (after
petroleum and phosphate rock) into
Geelong, where its imports are increasing
mainly to serve the expanding manufac-
ture of cement.
The functioning of the ports in this
complementary-competitive fashion in-
evitably affects their hinterland relations.
So Melbourne, the “capital port”, serves
not only the city of Melbourne but also
the whole State of Victoria and some
towns located interstate. Geelong, too,
serves much of the State, with which it
is linked by a fairly direct system of
roads and railways.
Similarly, Portland serves a wide area
as the chief oat-exporting port, but its
services are mostly oriented towards its
immediate vicinity, the south-western
section of Victoria, and the south-east
of South Australia. Thus, except for
Melbourne which alone serves much of
eastern Victoria (but as part only of its
hinterland), none of the ports can claim
an exclusive hinterland for which it
serves all functions. All the hinterlands
overlap. It is only in terms of a few
commodities that exclusive hinterlands
can be distinguished.
The author says that the process of
metropolitanisation has fostered the con-
centration of functions and services in
Melbourne, and its continued operation
is likely to make further development of
the other Victorian ports a difficult pro-
cess. This will be less difficult for Gee-
long, which is close enough to Mel-
bourne to be considered in some ways
part of the metropolis, than for Portland
with its almost exclusively agricultural
hinterland and its inadequate railway
network.
Portland's importance in exports,
-*• which remained virtually unchanged
from 1951 to 1960, has increased as a
result of being chosen as the principal
shipper of oats. Although Portland’s
significance has increased, and there is a
likelihood of the bulk export of barley
being resumed, Britton thinks it is un-
likely that this port will ever assume a
major role in handling Victorian imports
or exports.
On the other hand, Britton says the
development of port facilities on Western
Port Bay, located to the east of Port
Phillip Bay, will be accompanied by a
speedy growth of traffic because of the
industrial use that will be made of this
port. Enjoying a position comparable
to that of Geelong in proximity to the
State capital and with easy access to the
industrial areas developing to the east of
Melbourne, particularly near Dandenong
and in the Latrobe Valley, he believes
the port may soon become as important
as Geelong.
However, he considers that neither this
development nor the growth of traffic
through existing ports seems likely to
affect Melbourne's position because the
population and industries of the metro-
politan area, the facilities and services
already existing there, the ready availa-
bility of a wide variety of cargoes for all
types of vessels calling at the port, and
the focusing of Victoria’s rail and road
networks upon it, will together maintain
its primacy.


“CROESUS”
Mr Whitlam in Wonderland
Controlling foreign-owned investment
"Defreshed from his recent overseas
■*-* visit, the Deputy Leader of the
Federal Labor Party, Mr Gough Whit-
lam, came up with three hotly controver-
sial ideas in the Budget debate. One was
to set up a Government trust to acquire,
as a start, a 10 p.c. interest in all enter-
prises in Australia, wholly owned by
overseas interests. Another was to revive
the tax-on-interest as a means of bringing
the fringe financiers under the Banking
Act, putting them on all fours with the
trading banks for credit controls. A third
was to stop the free-for-all scramble for
resources which resulted in having enough
money for service stations but not for
roads, enough for city land development
but not for the Ord River and enough for
luxury housing but not for schools.
There’s plenty of room for argument
in all these, though here we will confine
our attention only to the first suggestion,
which many people will see as providing
a back door for possible wider excursions
of Government into ownership of indus-
try, be it foreign owned, partly foreign
owned or even wholly owned by Austra-
lians. First, we should have a look at
Mr Whitlam’s figures.
Mr Whitlam says a 10 p.c. in-
terest in enterprises here which are fully
owned by overseas interests would cost
the Government about £250 million. So
that on this reckoning the total value of
these firms is put at £2500 million. Mr
Whitlam didn't give his source. Whatever
it may be, it certainly looks to be wide of
the mark for foreign investment in fully
overseas owned enterprises here. Indeed,
as one is about to demonstrate, it is much
nearer the total of private overseas in-
vestment in all Australian enterprises in
which foreigners have an interest,
whether they wholly or partly own them.
mostly on figures in the annual
bulletins of overseas investment, one
arrives at an estimate of £2242 million
for total foreign investment (including
portfolio investment) in companies as at
June 30, 1963. After that date, using the
preliminary balance-of-payments figures
for the year to June 30, 1964, one esti-
mates subsequent additions to foreign in-
vestment in companies here to be £225
million. Adding in this amount one gets
a total foreign investment figure at June
30, 1964, of £2465 million, admitting
frankly it could be £5O million out either
way, possibly more because of the diffi-
culty of getting a value for portfolio
investment.
The breakdown of the total as at June
30, 1963, is as follows: First, undistri-
buted profits, £493 million. Second, paid
up value of shares, debentures, notes and
other obligations held by foreigners in
Australian enterprises, £825.3 million.
Third, £344 million owing in intercom-
pany accounts by Australian subsidiaries
to overseas parents and associated com-
panies. Fourth, £330 million for the book
value of net assets in Australia of bran-
ches of overseas companies operating
here. Fifth, £250 million (partly esti-
mated) for portfolio investment of for-
eigners in Australian companies (this
does not allow for dis-investment, nor
for appreciation in the value of port-
folio investment).
Thus on the estimated figure of £2465
million for total private foreign invest-
ment at June 30, 1964, it is clear that
the cost of a tenth interest in all private
foreign investment here would be of the
order of £250 million, but a tenth interest
in wholly-owned foreign enterprises
would not cost nearly as much as that
because many enterprises in which for-
eigners have interests already have Aus-
tralian participation.
TTnfortunately one cannot go on to
show just how much the fully-owned
enterprises would cost. If Mr Whitlam
has indeed made a calculation it would
be interesting to see it. None is available
from official Canberra sources. As it is,
one gets the impression that the Com-
monwealth Statistician is battling to get
his valuable and tidy columns for the
break-up of overall private overseas in-
vestment and its annual inflow.
The world of public companies may
be an open book but, at least to the out-
sider, that of the proprietary companies
where overseas interest is more übiqui-
tous remains largely a mystery. One
doubts very strongly whether the Deputy
Leader of the Opposition knows his way
about in it any better than most of us.
Without going into the political side,
which doesn’t concern us here, one must
say that for the Government to buy into
foreign owned companies would be a
drastic way of tackling the problem of
“excessive” foreign investment, as Mr
Whitlam calls it. To my mind it neglects
the fact that, without going to all the
trouble to set up a trust and possibly
prejudice the arrival here of “sufficient”
overseas capital in the future, the Gov-
ernment already has a huge stake in all
foreign capital invested here through the
collection of taxation. True, unlike many
other countries which, for this reason,
are not so favored by foreign invest-
ment, we do not have discriminatory
taxation against foreign enterprise. But
we sock it pretty heavily all the same
and have (remember!) stepped up com-
pany tax by sixpence to Bs. 6d. in the
pound on public companies with corres-
ponding increases for proprietaries, the
main target of Mr Whitlam's suggestion,
Tt may be quite true that future dividend
A remittances from foreign owned
enterprises will pose awkward problems
for the balance of payments in the fut-
ure. This isn't going to be alleviated
much by canalising one-tenth of these
into the hands of the Government.
Clearly Mr Whitlam must be after a
much bigger percentage and in that case,
unless his motive is to stop the inflow
of capital, it would seem a much better
idea to consider a withholding tax on
dividend remittances, such as New Zea-
land introduced in its Budget in June
and many other countries, like Canada
and Italy, have in operation. At least
foreign investors are used to having to
pay such a tax in many countries. So long
as we didn’t make it too stiff doubtless
they would continue, but perhaps not on
such a beneficial scale as at present, to
send their capital and technical know-
how here.
If foreign investment is in fact “ex-
cessive”, this would be far the better way
to dampen it down a bit, always remem-
bering the danger that repressive meas-
ures could easily force too much of it
to go elsewhere. The immediate role of
Government in this matter is not to make
demands which will turn away useful
overseas capital or enterprise. It is to
see if something can be done to mitigate
the abuses, to prevent takeovers by for-
eigners which add nothing to the econo-
my, and to stop the alienation of valuable
natural resources. Unfortunately, the
Federal Government (which has admit-
tedly been rather more vigilant lately)
and also the States have too often turned
a blind eye to blatant exploitation.

A Super Deal for Men on the Land
Fertilisers playing an increasingly important role
rpHE Government’s intention, in the
•*- Budget last year, to stimulate the
use of superphosphate in Australian
agriculture has paid off and it is now
being used in quantities which strain
the resources of manufacturers.
The much needed tonic the Govern-
ment gave such a vitally necessary com-
modity was the £3 a ton bounty placed
on superphosphate. It represented a
saving of 25 to 30 p.c. to the farmer on
his super purchases and enabled manu-
facturers to consider more seriously, and
earlier, expansion plans in order to keep
up with a growing demand.
It meant that the price to the farmer
was reduced to £9 12s. 6d. a ton in a jute
bag, £9 2s. 6d. a ton in a paper bag and
£7 16s. in bulk. Coupled with this was
the inherent advantage to Australian
agriculture, the greater acreage yields
and thus greater returns to the farmer.
It was difficult at the time to measure
the boost the bounty would give super
production but now that nearly
a full year’s figures are avail-
able it is obvious. In 1960-61
2,531,000 tons were produced,
in 1961-62 2,591,000 tons and
in 1962-63 2,862,000 tons. But
for the first 11 months of
1963-64 3,055,000 tons were
produced. In line with this is
the rise in production of sul-
phuric acid, a necessary pro-
duction ingredient. From 1960-
61’s figure of 1,122,000 tons,
output for the first 11 months
of 1963-64 totalled 1,289,000
tons, easily exceeding the pre-
vious full year’s 1,249,000 tons.
Use of fertilisers in Australia
is amongst the lowest in the
world probably because any
increased yields from our crops
would have been surplus to both the
domestic and foreign market. How-
ever, as wheat sales to China and Russia
and expanding fruit markets in Europe
as well as increasing beef and lamb sales
to the US and Great Britain have shown,
fertilisers have established themselves
immovably in the Australian agricultural
scene.
Markets for superphosphate in par-
ticular are expanding every day. The
Ord River irrigation scheme in Western
Australia will, when completed, provide
a very important outlet for Cresco Fer-
tilisers products. New cane leases in
Queensland and the growth of the Aus-
tralian cotton industry at Wee Waa,
near Narrabri in northern NSW, will
give a boost to production.
The bounty has benefited not only the
farmer and the manufacturers, but also
the aerial agriculturalists. The savings
the farmer has made has caused a trend
towards more superphosphate being
spread from the air. Information on the
use of superphosphate from the air is
contained in the following table.
Tons of super

The public companies in the field
of fertiliser manufacture are: Ade-
laide Chemicals, Australian Fertilizer,
Cresco Fertilisers WA and SA, Cuming
Smith, ICIANZ and Wallaroo-Mount
Lyell Fertilisers, but there seems to be a
general reluctance in the industry to talk
about its operations and economics.
The two largest fertiliser manufac-
turers are ICIANZ and Australian Fer-
Australian Superphosphate Production
tilizers. ICI is the biggest in Victoria
and sells below the price charged in
NSW by Australian Fertilizers. Recently
Australian Fertilizers announced a re-
duction in the price of superphosphate
only a few weeks after it had raised the
price by 17s. a ton. The new prices now
are £9 15s. a ton in a corn sack, £9 ss.
a ton in paper bags, £7 18s. 6d. a ton
bulk. Superphosphate in Victoria costs
about £6 4s. a ton bagged.
In Victoria superphosphate in corn
sacks costs £7 18s. 6d. a ton, in poly-
ethylene and paper bags £7 10s., and in
bulk £6 4s. 6d. If cash is paid within
thirty days farmers are entitled to a ss.
discount. Most of them take advantage
of this so prices in effect are £7 13s. 6d.,
£7 ss. and £5 19s. 6d.
AFL explains the price difference
between NSW and Victoria this way:
The fertiliser industry requires high
capital investment and a great volume
of throughput to achieve economies in
production costs. NSW landholders are
using only a little more than half the
super Victorian farmers use and conse-
quently “in the past it has not been pos-
sible to produce on as large a scale at
the same unit cost per ton”.
Railway truck preparation costs are
higher. It costs on an average £3 15s.
more to line and prepare a railway truck
each time it is used to carry bulk super
in NSW than in Victoria.
Because of the unprecedented increase
in demand for superphosphate, especially
in NSW, large expansion plans are being
drawn up. AFL, for instance, is to spend
£3.2 million (see Bulletin story p. 67,
August 15) to install Australia’s largest
sulphuric acid plant at Port Kembla and
to expand super production facilities to
allow for an output of more than 1 mil-
lion tons a year.
But this, according to a re-
port to the Graziers’ Association,
is not good enough. The con-
sultants who prepared the re-
port say there is room in NSW
for a third manufacturer. They
said that a plant with 200,000
tons capacity would cost about
£3 million and there were indi-
cations that even though AFL
and Sulphide planned to expand
their capacity they would not
be able to supply the demand
within two years.
An executive of one company
said he expected the use of fer-
tiliser in Australia to increase
at a rapid rate. “Previous ex-
pansion has been helped, not
only by the bounty on super,
but by the farmer’s desire to boost pro-
duction so he can take full advantage of
recent high prices for primary produce,
and by higher farm incomes over the
last two or three years. This trend to-
wards greater use of fertiliser will con-
tinue because of extensive development
of new land in Queensland and Western
Australia.
“NSW still has a long way to go in
its use of superphosphate. Farmers
there use about half as much as Vic-
torians and not quite as much as West
Australians. At the end of 1963 Vic-
torian farmers were using more than a
million tons a year, WA farmers about
770,000 and NSW farmers about
630,000 tons. As the biggest wheat
producing State in Australia the use in

“Use of super in NSW in 1958 was
about 270,000 tons. By 1963 it had
risen to 480,000 tons and with the intro-
duction of the bounty consumption
passed the 650,000 tons mark. The use
of super in NSW has not been as great
jn Victoria for two reasons. Firstly the
Victorian landholder was quicker to de-
velop the clover plant for pasture im-
provement than his NSW counterpart.
“Secondly the average property size in
the super-consuming areas of NSW is
double that of Victoria and there has
not been the same economic pressure to
develop properties.”
The big increase in NSW usage started
in 1959 when AFL set up its contract
air-spreading service which today uses
about half that company's output of
super for aerial spreading. Equipment in-
volved in this service entails the use of 60
aircraft, 40 unloading units and more
than 120 trucks, not to mention the rail-
ways. Since 1960 there has been a grad-
ual decline in the amount of super sold
bagged and an increase in the amount
sold in bulk. At present about 64 p.c.
is sold in bulk, a high proportion of
which is spread from the air.
Following the announcement of the
super bounty AFL revised its estimated
demand figure of 550,000 tons to
640,000 tons and was, in fact, caught
with its stocks down when farmers really
turned on the heat and demanded
660,000 tons—an increase of 172,000
tons or 35 p.c. more than the previous
year. Because AFL and Sulphide Cor-
poration (jointly owned by Conzinc Rio
Tinto and Broken Hill Consolidated and
which combines with AFL in selling
and distribution) could not meet the
demand an extra 60.000 to 100,000
tons had to be embarrassingly imported,
presumably from Victoria.

Land" on page 80.]

engineering industries could be mis-
leading. There are some excellent re-
coveries reported in the building and
engineers’ supply group (and even the
timber industry is shining hopefully with
good results from Vanderfield and Reid,
Allen Taylor and Kilndried Timber).
But there are still some shadows cast
on the profitability of the contractors
and developers. It has been- no secret
that many overseas contractors have
been tendering below cost in the build-
ing industry, in an effort to gain a foot-
hold. The big loss by Perini confirmed
this.
As a result, investors who hold shares
in building and development companies
have asked themselves if some of the
inherent losses, or incipient write-offs,
may be deferred for a year or so pen-
ding a possible improvement in profit
margins.
It is a tricky subject and a lot depends
on how the directors of certain com-
panies assess the book value of develop-
ment projects, work in progress, holding
charges, etc.
There have been lots of whispers
about huge losses on building contracts
and money tied up in projects which are
eating their heads off in interest charges.
This sort of thing is like a paper loss on
shares—it is never regarded as a real loss
until you sell the shares and count your
net result.
★ ★ ★
•Jheorising aside, the prospects which
must be assessed by investors in the
next six months include the effects of
tighter credit, higher wage costs, in-
creased company tax and, if you can
borrow the money, a higher interest rate
structure. If commodity prices ease
overseas and export earnings are mark-
edly offset by imports, investors must be
prepared for further Governmental
measures to trim the economy, inclu-
ding further possible tax increases to
meet higher defence costs.
The investments they select, therefore,
must qualify with good profit-earning
ability, which can withstand a bit of
whittling from all those outside influ-
ences.
That is why earnings and current
trading performance must be given keen
attention.

Gospel According to BHP
Tt looks as if BHP shareholders will
just have to stand in patient admira-
tion of the company’s performance, and
accounts, for some time yet. Not one
feature of the latter even begins to hint
at any close prospects of an issue, or
indeed of the necessity for an outside
call on funds at all.
The group’s liquidity is fast becoming
proverbial and might possibly be a slight
embarrassment to the board. During
1963-64 bond holdings were increased
by £272,734 to reach a massive
£49,466,040 (at cost). Cash, still large,
came back from £1,670,928 to £872,126.
What seems to be becoming a matter
of routine, though, is the ability to
finance repeated and wide-ranging expan-
sion from inside cash flow. Some £3B
million of internally-generated resources
were available last year, going a long
way to meet total capital spending of
£43 million.
On the surface, that amount appears
somewhat lower than the previous two
years’ rate. But the chairman, Sir Colin
Syme, had earlier mentioned the attain-
ment of quite considerable cost savings.
The speed of technical advancement and
productive capacity is moving much the
same as before.
There does not remain any room for
complacency and tapering-off here, how-
ever. Despite an 11.5 p.c. rise in ingot
production in 1963-64, Sir Colin has to
confess that “our output was not suffi-
cient to cater fully for the local market
which has had to have recourse to some
importations. Indications point to a con-
tinuance of these conditions in the imme-
diate future”.
This familiar position, in periods of
hectic local demand, again meant that
BHP had to play ducks and drakes with
its export market. “Substantial sales were
made to New Zealand, but for the most
part sales to other export markets had to
be restricted to token tonnages designed
to preserve some degree of continuity
and service to overseas customers and
distributors,” Sir Colin observes.
In the present hyper-keen competitive-
ness of world steel, it can hardly be
expected that “token” gestures are
enough.
As Sir Colin also says, “Under current
expansive conditions demand is very
difficult to forecast.” The next twelve
months will see a further boost to out-
put, particularly from Whyalla’s first
stage. A monopolist’s expansion can give
no sign of slackening.
Pastoral Bonanza
huge Elder Smith Goldsbrough
Mort pastoral amalgam could hardly
hope to surprise the markets unduly with
its spanking 1963-64 result. Investors
contented themselves by initially mark-
ing the 10s. shares up 6d. to 28s. 6d.
The various pastoral oscillations during
1964 had seen a top at 295. 6d.
In one sense, Elders join a well-
discounted sectional procession. Wineh-
combe Carson, Pitt Son and Badgery,
Younghusband, Strachan, Dennys
Lascelles —all of these got in before with
obvious evidence of woolbroking suc-
cesses.
Nevertheless, the second post-merger
profit did at least guarantee a most

HOW TO REDUCE
DEATH DUTIES WITH
A FAMILY TRUST
A series of large assessments of probate
duty can quickly destroy a family’s
fortune. All precautions should be taken
to prevent this happening.
Death duties cannot be avoided, but they certainly can be
minimized. An ideal method is through the setting-up of
a Family Trust. This is a legal, tested procedure, which
enables a family to retain the maximum possible portion
of an estate as family deaths occur.
To learn more about Family Trusts, send this coupon for
our free booklet, "Estate Planning.” Ring this office for a

handsome cover to the promised 10 p.c.
dividend. A £815,525 advance i n
earnings, bringing them to £2,616,203,
put earning rate up from 15 to 21.8
p.c. on the £l2 million capital.
Something of the benefits of com-
bination, apart from buoyant rural con-
ditions, must be suggested by a profit
nearly twice the previous aggregate bests
of the once-separated companies. Tax,
as well, is notoriously high at £2,417,476.
The group’s traditionally well-presented
report and accounts will be eagerly
awaited, especially for any comments
they may contain on the wool reserve
price debate.
Steady Growth for Hilton
the balance sheet review on Hilton
Corporation (The Bulletin, May 9,
p. 68) pointed out, the company’s future
looks to be one of steady growth. The
recently released 1963-64 results con-
firm this. Profit rose from £217,000
to £233,000, to give a slight boost in
the earning rate from 20.1 p.c. to 21.6
p.c. Dividend will be 13 1/3 p.c. for
the third year in succession.
This rate was originally established in
1962, after profits had recovered from
the 1961 low of £131,000, or 11.9 p.c.
on capital. The latest profit is the best
for six years. The peak was £285,000
in 1957-58, equalling 49 p.c. on capital.
This was achieved before the disastrous
takeover of P. C. Miller, a private forg-
ing company supplying the automotive
industry.
The credit squeeze and the recession
in the automobile industry had dire
effects on the performance of P. C.
Miller. However, the road is clear now
as trading has been stopped—capital
losses were £138,000 and all have been
written off against reserves as at June
30, 1964. At balance date last year
those totalled well over £l| million, so
the blow has not been too hard. It
may actually be less than £138,000, as
the Miller land, 4.6 acres in rapidly-
expanding Nunawading, is being sub-
divided and has yet to be sold.
The current year should see a con-
tinuance of the steady 1963-64 growth.
It may see better increases in perform-
ance now that directors have most of
P. C. Miller’s problems out of the way.
Undoubtedly, these gained much atten-
tion over recent years, possibly to the
detriment of the rest of the group which,
nevertheless, is still performing well.

SHARE OPTION TRADING
BECOMING POPULAR
The buying and selling of options on stocks
and shares has long been a significant invest-
ment activity in England and America. Until
recent times Australians had paid little atten-
tion to the various methods of using Put and
Call Options to achieve profits and, at the
same time, to safeguard their investment deci-
sions. One simple example of how you can
profit from option trading is. . . . You arrange
an option to buy some likely shares (say within
three months). If, as you anticipated, the
shares rise in value at some time during this
period, you will then exercise the option. This
means that you obtain the shares at the lower
price prevailing when the option was arranged.
Thus you profit to the extent of the value
variation.
On the other hand, should the shares not
rise as you expected, or even fall in value
during the option period, you will let your
option expire. All it will have cost you is the
small premium paid for the option. You will
not have lost on the falling price of the shares.
The various methods of how people profit from
Put and Call Options are explained in a
brochure available from—

partners” for participation in other
ventures.
Details of these negotiations should
be in the hands of the Press between
ow and September 14, the date of the
annual meeting. Immediate release of
the full particulars regarding the new
proposals is not “practicable” according
to directors, because “other parties” are
involved. This strongly suggests the
possibility of a link with some Australian
public company.
The annual report emphasises that
the new developments will not neces-
sarily involve large capital expenditure
by the company. In other words there
will probably be no shareholders’ issue
in the near future for diversification pur-
poses. However, directors do say that
the plans may create opportunities for
further investment in future years.
Rural Beneficiary
JPhe 1963-64 rural boom has certainly
not bypassed agricultural machinery
makers, if Perth-headquartered Cham-
berlain Holdings is any guide. The com-
pany’s chairman, Sir Lance Brisbane,
also sounds completely confident about
further successes during the current
year.
After a record profit, up by £83,895
to £298,870 and giving a dazzling 54.3
p.c. earning rate, directors lifted divi-
dend to 12i p.c. by including a bonus
2\ p.c. It should be recalled, too, that
1962-63 earnings had taken in a
£125,648 pre-acquisition element.
Sales in the latest period gained 19.1
p.c. to reach £6,410,000, with turnover
of parts and accessories adding 25 p.c.
Earnings were subject to full tax (at
the new rates), since previous loss bene-
fits have now disappeared.
Chamberlain runs branches in all
mainland States. Each made “signifi-
cant” advances.
The ss. shares are listed at Perth and
Melbourne. Prices remain around
235. 6d., below 1964’s best of 245. 6d.
A 25 p.c. interest in Chamberlain
is held by Australian United Enterprises
Pty, a subsidiary of Australian United
Corporation Ltd.
Sparking Ahead
Tallowing steadily rising profits since
1961, Electrical Equipment of Aus-
tralia has earned at a record rate in the
year to June 30 and reports a net profit
of £240,967.
Accordingly, dividend is increased
from last year's 12 p.c. to 13 j p.c. Pro-
visions for tax (£185,382) and deprecia-
tion (£43,425) are higher than last year.
The company made its fourth cash
issue in seven years in June with a one-
for-nine distribution of ordinaries at ss.
par. Shares are at present selling at
about 245. 3d.
Concrete Evidence
Ts good news about to be forthcoming
from Concrete Industries Ltd? The
market seems to think so, for it added
4d. to the shares to bring them up to
Bs. 4d. on the directors’ brief statement
that dividend was increased from 6i to
9 p.c. for the year to June 30.
Directors gave no details of profit
figures. The market was doubtless
heartened by the higher return and re-
membered the announcement in June
that trading results indicated pre-tax pro-
fits substantially higher than the pre-
vious year’s, when they fell from
£933,743 to £795,638 and dividend was
cut from 10 to 6i p.c.
Meanwhile shareholders wish the
auditors would hurry up so they can
find out just how much higher profit is.
Breakwater for Lempriere
IV/lany investors tend to forget that
fluctuating metal prices concern
O. T. Lempriere, mainly because it is
not listed in the mining sector along
with the metal mining stocks. The
company is a metal smelter and refiner.
Its alarming results for the last two years
should help impress the importance of
metal prices (to the company) onto the
mind of the general investor.
In 1962-63, profit crashed 32 p.c. to
£58,000, largely because of the fall in
metal prices. Earning rate was only
9.5 p.c. and reserves were drawn on to
make up the usual 10 p.c. dividend.
The 1964 result is. out, full of surprises,
to those who overlooked the effect which
the 1963-64 metal price boom would
have on the firm’s performance. Profit
doubled to £127,000, to equal 21.3 p.c.
on capital.
The dividend will be raised to 11 p.c.
by the addition of a small bonus, but
directors warn that the basic rate is still
10 p.c. Such a warning merely reflects
a conservative outlook. It also suggests
that metal prices, tin especially, may not
necessarily hold their high levels through
the rest of 1964-65.
Nevertheless, the buoyant 1963-64
year has allowed the setting up of fur-
ther breakwaters in case metal prices
are washed down. Around £35,000 has
been transferred to the metal price
fluctuation reserve, so it now stands at
£140,000. In 1963, £25,000 was trans-
ferred out of this reserve to offset losses
arising from the lower prices.
Wormald Revival
VlTormald Brothers Industries’ re-
markably succinct profit statement
may have brought some cheer to share-
holders, though the market reacted by
bringing the ss. shares up 3d. to Bs.
Prices have been moderately higher, at
Bs. 9d. during 1964.
Perhaps investors are waiting to learn
how much of the diverse group’s im-
provement comes from a rather neces-
sary reorganisational streamlining and
how much from the vigorous building
upsurge. Shifting the dividend from 5

to 8 pc., a f ter the long 10 p.c. run up

Nevertheless the profit rise was most
striking, at a near-record £373,432 re-
presenting an improvement of 78 p.c.

slump. Latest earning rate, 10.9 p.c.,

Splitting Straws
There seems to have been a certain
amount of straw-splitting between
Mutual Stores and Cleckheaton before
the former's directors finally came round
to accepting a takeover bid. Until last
week they were merely “not unfavorably
disposed” to Cleckheaton’s offer, mainly
because of a dividend difference between
the two companies.
Following Cleckheaton’s announce-
ment of an increased profit and dividend
for 1963-64 some time ago, this com-
plaint was removed. Moreover, it was
made fairly obvious that Cleckheaton
was in for a rather successful 1964-65.
It still took Mutual directors more than
a week to get round to recommendation.
Why?
It seems that Mutual was more con-
cerned over the actual value of the bid,
rather than the dividend differences.
Rightly so! It was worth only 2s. for the
shares, which are reported to have an
asset backing of around 3s. each. Cleck-
heaton will also get the benefit of some
£850,000 in accumulated tax losses—a
vital item in 1964-65, and future years,
if it is to keep its tax bill as low as
previous years.
The final outcome seems to be rather
a result of straw-splitting or an unsuc-
cessful attempt by Mutual to get more
by holding the recommendation up. The
bid was raised, but only by the laugh-
able extent of id. a share to 2s. 03d.
This seems sheer mockery at Mutual’s
expense—at least a Id. increase would
not have looked so ridiculous. Still,
directors tried, and even under these
terms, the post-merger rate will be about
70 p.c. higher than without takeover.
Based on current prices market value
of the shares should be about 20 p.c.
higher.
Bouncy SA Rubber
Australian Rubber Holdings
Limited hoisted its profit for the
year to June 30 to a new record with a
'O.l p.c. rise. The peak figure of
£376,390 covers the steady 113 p.c. divi-
dend more than twice.
It was arrived at after slightly higher
Provisions—tax is up £12,500 to
1253,000, depreciation up £l4Bl to
£220,278..
The dividend includes the first pay-
ment on the 1,780,520 ordinary ss.
shares issued to the US Rubber Co. to
give it a 25 p.c. interest. They were
issued in October last year and so far
are paid to 23d. When fully paid SA
Rubber will collect £1,513,442, including
share premium of 12s. a unit.
Humes Slips Slightly
the adoption of a common
balance date for all its subsidiaries,
Humes Ltd’s profit seems glossier on the
surface than it is underneath.
When the extra 6 months’ trading
results of the subsidiary Hume Industries
(Far East) Ltd is deducted from the
consolidated profit of £1,025,176, group
profit slips to £882,749—a fall of
£60,848 or 6.4 p.c. on the previous
year's result of £943,597.
It stands after tax of £848,945 (up
£26,983) and depreciation of £837,178
(up £50,219) and represents an earning
rate of 23.8 p.c. (last year 25.5 p.c.) on
ordinary capital, after deducting prefer-
ence charges of £27,188.

In the preliminary report, directors
say group sales for the year (excluding
the Far East subsidiary’s extra 6 months’
trading) rose £717,573 to £23,956,513.
The loss of £275,000 on the sale of the
investment in Wunderlich Humes
Asbestos Pipes Pty was written off
against capital reserves at June 30.
Ordinary dividend is held at 14 p.c.
with a final 7 p.c. which comprises 5 p.c.
from profit earned in Australia and 2
p.c. from overseas subsidiaries’ dividends.
At next balance date Humes will not
be able to show an extra 6 months from
its Far East subsidiary and it will not
have to face a capital loss as it did in
its latest year by getting out of the pipe
venture. The market’s assessment of
the shares at 725. is a fair one.
Tarax Shareholders Thirst
FVespite its partial profit recovery in
” the year to June 30, Tarax Drinks
has left the dividend at 10 p.c. It was
halved to this last year, after adverse
weather conditions had reduced the
earning rate from 24.7 p.c. to 12 p.c.
Although the latest recovery to only
17.1 p.c. earning rate is not complete,
shareholders were expecting a payout
increase, mainly because of the char-
acter of past dividend policy.
It was a 20 p.c. distribution in 1961,
from earnings of 33 p.c. However, de-
spite the gigantic expansionary paid
capital increases of 1961-62, which re-
sulted in a substantial drop in earnings
to 24.7 p.c., the 20 p.c. payment was
maintained. Even last year a 10 p.c.
distribution was made from the low 12.9
p.c. earnings. One can hardly blame
shareholders for expecting something
better this year.
Part of the reason behind the direc-
tors’ decision will be the fact that tax
losses may be non-existent in 1964-65.
Provision was only £14,000 this year,
leaving a £17,000 profit, thanks to prior
tax losses of acquired subsidiaries. If
full tax happens to become payable in
the current term, earnings could well
ease back to 1963 levels, leaving little
cover for any dividend above 10 p.c. It
is wise to avoid the creation of awkward
precedents.
Nasty Medicine
p. H. Faulding and Co. Ltd, Adelaide
wholesale druggist and manufactur-
ing chemist, is holding its dividend steady
at 10 p.c. even though profit fell sharply
in the year to June 30.
The market is looking closely at other
chemists now that both DHA and
Faulding have reported profit drops fol-
lowing increased costs and reduced
Margins. Fauldings fell £23,316 to
£lo4,47l—the lowest for seven years.
Tax provision is down £10,318 to
£77,772 and depreciation is £1744 lower
at £46,376. Earning rate, after prefer-
ence charges have been deducted, slips
from 15 to 10.7 p.c. The surplus after
meeting ordinary and preference divid-
ends is a slim £15,969.
The ss. shares are selling at around
9s. 6d., where the yield is 5.3 p.c.
Hecla May Need Funds
TI/Tr R. J. Marriott, managing direc-
tor of Hecla, did the right thing at
the company’s annual meeting last week
when he threw some light on the direc-
tors’ dividend policy. The payment has
been lifted from 8 p.c. to 9 p.c. after
an earnings rate jump from 14 p.c. to
22.2 p.c. The Bulletin of August 29
(p. 61) felt this dividend lift was rather
paltry considering the much heavier pro-
fit result, but concluded that this pos-
sibly augured well for further increases
in 1964-65.
At the meeting, Mr Marriott contra-
dicted this view by pointing out that all
liquid funds were necessary at present
in order to finance certain expansion
plans. So, in fact, the higher payout
was really a generous move.
The expansion plans will mainly in-
volve extensions to the company’s range
of electrical goods. If the need to con-
serve funds for this is so acute, there
is a distinct possibility of a shareholders’
issue this year. True, the 22.2 p.c.
earning rate could well take a knock
from such moves, but the 9 p.c. divi-
dend would be in little danger, even if
the issue was a big one.

AM’s Long, Slow Haul
A ustralian National Industries Ltd continues its process
of recovery from the dismal 1961-62 result with the
latest profii of £274,516. ANI as an engineer and motor
distributor suffered severely under the clamps Mr Holt applied
in 1960. The period of withdrawal from the doldrums to
anything like a satisfactory earning year (latest earning rate
is 10.8 p.c.) has been a long, slow one.
However, the latest result still fails to impress investors who,
possibly expecting similar adverse effects from the higher
sales tax on cars announced in the Budget last month, refuse
to let the ss. shares get their heads above water by keeping
them around 4s. Bd., where the yield on the steady 6 p.c,
dividend is 6.4 p.c.
Profit increased by 41.4 p.c. or £80,355 on the previous
year’s result of £194,161, which in turn represented an ex-
cellent recovery from 1961-62’s £36,312. It remained after
tax of £123,934 (up £119,482) and depreciation £172,796 (up
£6965).
Good PR from Eric White
people who doubted the ability of Eric White Associ-
A ates Ltd to earn as a public company must have felt fool-
ish when its annual accounts were released.
There was talk at the time of flotation (in January, when the
ss. shares at a premium of 2s. 9d. came on exchange at 11s.,
then jumped to 155.) that a company whose assets were mainly
intangible could not show worthwhile results.
To straighten this out, profit for the year to June 30 was
£40,122 (or 40.1 p.c. on issued capital of £100,000) compared
with the previous year’s £38,084. The prospectus forecast a
16| p.c. dividend. Shareholders will receive 17.08 p.c.
However, as directors point out, the latest profit is not com-
parable with previous results because it was arrived at after
public company tax. Even so, the prospectus showed 1962-
63 profits calculated at public company rates, so there is some
basis of comparison for performance purposes.
Tax took £29,606 and depreciation £5983 out of the latest
result. The market is obviously confident that future per-
formances will be just as good, as the shares are now priced
at 245. where the yield is 3.5 p.c.
ARC Steps with Caution
HThe ARC Industries’ 40 p.c. profit lift to £667,000 in the
year to June 30 was, of course, no surprise. Back at an
extraordinary general meeting on May 6, the chairman,
Mr K. F. Cox, told shareholders that a record result of more
than £650,000 would be chalked up for the year. Although
the earning rate has recovered from 13.5 p.c. to almost 19 p.c.,
the ordinary dividend will stay at a rather low 7i p.c. This
rate was established last year following a one-for-one bonus
issue, prior to which a 15 p.c. payout was made.
This dividend cut took some of the cream off the bonus and
there seems little chance for even a partial restoration in
1964-65. Paid capital is due for a rise of £1.40 million, from
£3.57 million to £4.97 million the result of a two-for-five
issue at ss. par plus a 2s. 6d. premium. If profit was steady
this year, then the earning rate would slip back to 1963's
13.5 p.c. level.
However, the picture is not really as bad as this. Part
of the total £2.1 million raising will be used to expand the
company’s business as a supplier of concrete reinforcements,
precast concrete, industrial fencing and fabricated aluminium
and window products. Such expansion will no doubt boost
profits. In addition, the new shares rank for only two-thirds
of the interim dividend, but all of the final. So the year's
average capital will not be a full £4.97 million—2s. 6d. of the
total is not payable until December 15.
Combine this factor with the increased profit prospects, and
it may well be that earnings will recede only slightly. Such
being the case, there is a remote chance for a more reasonable
10 p.c. dividend. Directors, though, are taking wise pre*
cautions in holding the payment down for 1963-64.

SECURITY ANALYSIS
A Genuine Growth Stock
Dural Leeds spreads profits and benefits
Tr was once said that a requirement
of growth stock was that the com-
pany should be close to the consumer.
Dural Leeds Holdings Ltd is certainly
fairly close to the consumer. Judging by
the growth in net profit before tax from
1956 to 1960. it was certainly a growth
stock when it was floated as a public
company right in the beginning of the
“recession”. In four years profits in-
creased by 625 p.c. or from £15,000 to
£109,000. Yet, no doubt, because of the
time, the shares were placed with the
public at 7s. Today the two hundred
shares which cost £7O (excluding charges)
in December, 1960, are worth £247,
which seems to me to represent capital
appreciation alone at the average annual
compound rate of 37 p.c. It would be
an understatement to say that such a
rate of increase is not unattractive.
It appears that the original company,
Dural Leeds Pty Ltd, was registered in
1947 for the purpose of manufacturing
Venetian and holland blinds. The busi-
ness of L. C. Stewart, with which Dural
Leeds merged in 1960, started two years
earlier, in 1945. Dural Leeds Pty Ltd
appears to have grown rapidly. A pro-
perty was purchased at Ascot Vale in
1950 and a two-storey factory and office
building was erected there in 1952. Be-
tween 1956 and 1958, the company was
appointed a licensed manufacturer of
Hunter Douglas’ “Luxaflex” products.
No doubt this association has had some
bearing on Dural Leeds’ success, but, as
will be pointed out later, it was not of
major significance if the relative perfor-
mance of the two companies can be
taken as a yardstick.
Dural Leeds subsequently acquired the
blind business of J. Gadsden, and
later, after becoming a public company, it
acquired the Myer Emporium’s blind,
awning and insect screen manufacturing
business. In early 1963 it was announced
that the Adelaide blind manufacturer,
Llavel & Sons Ltd, had been acquired.
Earlier, in December, 1962, M. T. Brod-
ribb Pty Ltd, of Hobart, was acquired. It
would be fair to say that as a manufac-
turer of blinds, awnings and insect
screens Dural Leeds dominates Victoria,
South Australia and Tasmania.
Since the last balance date, the com-
pany appears to be diversifying a little,
though keeping close to “building fit-
tings”. T he acquisition of Eise and Mit-
chell Pty Ltd, which manufactures for
the plumbing industry, was announced
early in December, 1963. Recently Mr
W. Abbey, chairman and managing direc-
tor, stated that the company will under-
take the manufacture and distribution of
a newdy developed water filtration and
sterilisation unit.
The success which attended the opera-
tion of the group until the end of the
1962-63 year has certainly continued
in the latest year. At the time of
the declaration of the interim dividend
and a one-for-ten bonus issue, the direc-
tors said that “group profit for the half
year was more than the £87,012 earned
for the whole of 1962-63”. Earlier, when
the takeover of Eise and Mitchell was
announced, it was stated that Dural
Leeds’ earning rate was expected to be at
least maintained after the takeover. This
acquisition raised the ordinary capital by
£50,000 to £340,000, so it would appear
that earnings were expected to be of the
order of £llO,OOO this year. As it
happened the 1963-64 profit went up to
£120,973, to give a 34.6 p.c. earning
rate. The dividend remains a particu-
larly well covered 15 p.c.
At this stage it may be appropriate to
examine the fortunes of the New South
Wales company Mello-Lite which pre-
sumably had been the counterpart of
Dural Leeds. Just prior to the flotation
of Dural Leeds with a paid capital of
£200,000, Mello-Lite, whose paid capital
was then £350,000 in ordinary shares
plus £140,000 in li p.c. convertible
notes due December 31, 1965, had pro-
duced its accounts, showing earnings of
just under £37,500. Dural Leeds earned
just over £65,500 during the same
period.
In the following year, Mello-Lite’s
earnings dropped to £15,786 on an in-
creased ordinary capital of £362,800,
while Dural Leeds, with an unchanged
ordinary capital of £200,000, increased
earnings to a slightly higher figure of
£66,192.
Lollowing the reverse take-over by
Hunter Douglas, Mello-Lite’s ordinary
capital increased to £1,371,300 at the end
of the 1961-62 year and earnings rose
to £221,305, but in the 1962-63 year they
fell to £160,535.
It seems fairly clear that Dural Leeds
performed much better than Mello-Lite
prior to merging with Hunter Douglas.
Judging by figures given in Hunter
Douglas’ prospectus for an issue of un-
secured notes made in May, 1962, it may
be that Dural Leeds has performed better
than Hunter Douglas. The following
series are indices of the consolidated net
profit before tax of the two groups,
Year ended
June 30 1958 1959 1960 1961 1962 1963
Hunter Douglas 100 116 149 134 175 Un
Dural Leeds 100 114 195 197 214 253
Even allowing for the additional
“growth” from takeovers that Dural
Leeds would have obtained in 1962-63,
the record seems to have been rather
better than that of Hunter Douglas.
During 1962, Hunter Douglas sold at
a maximum of 15.6 times earnings and
a minimum of 14.0 times earnings, while
Dural Leeds sold at a maximum of 11,5
times and a minimum of 6.6 times. In
1963, Hunter Douglas reached 20.9 times
but was as low as 13.7, while Dural
Leeds varied between 16.8 and 12.9.
Today, Hunter Douglas is selling at
around 40s. and Dural Leeds around 235.
Whereas we can feel fairly confident that
Dural Leeds will have earned about Is
6d. per share in the 1963-64 year, so that
the current price represents 15.3 times
earnings, we do not have any worth-
while view on Hunter Douglas’ 1963-64
earnings since the interim announcement
merely said “profits for the first six
months of trading show improvement
over the same period last year”.
Perhaps the thought can be expressed
in the following fashion. Unless Hunter
Douglas’ earnings have increased by at
least 21 p.c. in 1963-64, it will be selling
at a higher price/earnings multiple than
Dural Leeds. The past record seems to
suggest that the reverse should be the
case, because Dural Leeds has not only
shown growth in profits of a higher
order, but has also given benefits to its
shareholders in the form of dividend
increases and recently with a bonus issue.
While the immediate dividend yield
from Hunter Douglas is higher than
Dural Leeds, the rate of growth of ad-
justed dividends per share of the latter
would make most investors incline to-
wards the shares of Dural Leeds. The
average annual rate of increase looks
like being about 7 p.c. per annum.

BEHIND THE BALANCE SHEETS
Sitting Tight for an Issue?
Minster after a record year
At the time of going to press, the
10s. shares of Minster Limited are
selling at record levels —between 100 s.
and 104 s. By the time the reader gets
around to this review of the company
and its prospects, there is every chance
that the shares will have moved even
higher. Why? Because every single
one of the pointers investors can think
of indicate the near proximity of a bonus
issue, or at least a cash one.
Just now the company shareholders
are tapping feet impatiently as they wait
for the annual meeting (especially the
many who have bought into the com-
pany “on spec” this year, particularly
since the record 1963-64 result was re-
leased on July 22). It is scheduled for
September 15 at mid-day in the head
office on the Princes Highway, Dande-
nong. Hopes are high for an issue
announcement from the chairman, Mr
W. G. Keighley.
Even if these hopes are dashed at the
meeting, the shares should not recede
very far on the market, if at all. It’s
just that September 15 is the only date
between now and the interim report for
the current December half-year (usually
released in January) on which share-
holders can expect definite statements
from the company’s management.
Tn recent years, there have been two
issues—both bonus jobs—a three-for-
four in 1956-57 and a one-for-two in
1959-60. The first was preceded by a
historically high earning rate of 33.4 p.c.
in 1955-56, the second by peak earnings
of 49.9 p.c. in 1958-59. The 1963-64
rate of 56.8 p.c. broke all preceding
records. This almost too-buoyant result
is the first pointer to the probability of
an issue in the near future, or at least
some time in the current year.
Added to this is the time factor, for
what it is worth. If there was a three-
year space between the issue in 1956-57
and the one in 1959-60 then, according
to logic, the next issue is already over-
due. Yet logic cannot be applied in
cases like this. Of more significance
is the fact that reserves at June 30 last
were as high in relation to paid capital
as they were before the previous issues.
The accompanying table shows them
at slightly more than £2 million com-
pared with the £1.6 million capital. This
is probably understating the case. To
start with, Minster is well known as one
of those “conservatively” minded com-
panies, when it comes to producing
annual accounts.
A prime example is the figure given
for fixed assets. Included in this is
“plant, machinery and motor vehicles”.
They are shown at a 13-year-old valu-
ation of £2.7 million, less depreciation
of £1 million, leaving £1.7 million.
However, an item “provision for in-
creased cost of plant replacement”,
absorbing £50,000 is further deducted
from fixed assets in the balance sheet.
This £50,000 makes little difference to
the £1.7 million residual. It has been
provided every year and, including the
1959-60 bonus year, £250,000 has been
stacked away since that last one-for-two
issue was made. The significance of this
extra depreciation is reflected by the fact
that the Stock Exchange of Melbourne,
in its “Official Record”, lists this item
as a transfer to reserves, not a deduction
from fixed assets, which are left at their
original figure less the normal deprecia-
tion.
/"\n top of all these pointers are several
others. Directors may feel uneasy
about sporting such a high earning rate,
especially as a virtual monopoly is held
in one line of manufacture—Westmins-
ter carpet. The 1963-64 performance
broke all existing records and yet the
dividend has not been lifted from the
long-established 20 p.c., despite the fact,
too, that it is close to being thrice
covered.
The encouraging prospects for the cur-
rent year cannot be ignored either. As
long as the fast rate of home-building
keeps up, the demand for carpets will.
Thirteen subsidiaries operate from
three States —Victoria, NSW and Queens-
land. A fourteenth, Corroboree Carpets
Ltd, is a Vancouver (Canada) concern.
The group manufactures products under
five basic trade names: “Westminster”
carpet which is sold for use in houses,
offices, hotels, motels, showrooms, shops
and cars; “Whichemco” aqueous rub-
ber and reclaim dispersions, carpet
backing compounds and adhesives;
“Rayco” industrial flock fillers, fibre-
coated materials and back-coating for
furnishing materials; “Linatex” abrasion
and corrosion - resistant linings, mining
and sand-washing equipment (including
pumps), hydro cyclones, valves and ball
mills; finally, “Gamrad” which covers
gamma-ray sterilised surgical sutures,
and the sterilisation of medical requisites
and industrial materials by gamma irra-
diation.
HThe parent company was originally
A formed in December, 1952, to ac-
quire all issued shares of Westminster
Carpets Pty Limited and the Whitehead
Chemical Co. (Aust.) Pty Limited. These
are both subsidiaries today. From these
basic activities, the company has gradu-
ally spread its interests to the fields it
occupies now. Carpet activities are still
the mainstay, and the chief key to the
success of recent years.
The 1963-64 sharp profit rise of nearly
30 p.c., from £719,000 to £932,000, is
virtually a direct result of the sharp rise
in the demand for non-woven carpets.
Although demand figures are not avail-
able, the Commonwealth Statistician’s
production figures give some guide. In
1963-64, Australian non-woven carpet
production rose about 25 p.c., from 4.78
to 5.97 million square yards. West-
minster, a non-woven product, has a
large portion of this market and Minster
is the only company producing it.
It is also the only company specialising
in the non-woven field. Australia's two
other major carpet makers, Felt and
Textiles and Carpet Manufacturers, turn
out both woven and non-woven items.
Probably the main reason for the big
rise in non-woven demand is its relative
cheapness. In addition, there exists a
distinct tendency for the woven carpets
to rise in prices and compete with the
import market. As long as the present
home-building rate continues, and own-
ers still find their bank accounts being
tightly squeezed, the cheaper non-woven
product will hold its appeal and see con-

tinuing rises in demand. (In contrast
to the previously mentioned 25 p.c. pro-
duction increase, woven carpets saw a
mere 8 p.c. production increase in 1963-
64.)
The table reflects the financial
success which has derived from the com-
pany’s concentration on the popular non-
woven carpets. Future success will also
depend heavily on the demand for this
product. Probably one of the best ways
to get some guide on the company’s pro-
gress is by studying the monthly produc-
tion figures from Canberra. These, of
course, cover the whole industry, not
just Minster. So full emphasis should be
given to directors’ statements at the
annual meeting and in the interim report,
both of which will, as usual, be ex-
tremely reliable.
Working capital is the healthiest it's
ever been. In fact, it’s probably higher
than the table shows as, in line with
Minster’s conservatism, a £58,000 stock
fluctuation reserve has been deducted
from current assets every year since
1961-62. One of the reasons for the
almost excessive liquidity is the item
short-term investments, listed as a cur-
rent asset, which has jumped from nil
in 1962 to £40,000 last year and now up
to £665,000. Apparently the big post-
dividend profit surpluses of recent years
(a gigantic £604,000 in 1963-64) are
being put to profitable employ as the
company can find little use in its own
business for them.
This obvious surplus of liquid funds,
combined with the fact that shareholders
have suffered in the last two years from
the introduction of loan capital and
outside shareholders, provides further
evidence of the desirability of a bonus
issue. Notwithstanding this, sharehold-
ers’ assets have grown considerably. In
1963-64, the total asset position im-
proved from £4.8 million to £5.6 mil-
lion. Of these totals, the shareholders’
equity gained from £3.1 million to
£3.7 million.
To sum up Minster as an investment
proposition is not hard. Prices are now
too high for the speculator to indulge,
as they already carry a loading in expec-
tation of a bonus. These people must
lay off until the scrip comes on ex-bonus.
After this, and when interest in the com-
pany diminishes, there could be some
real bargain buying. Even then the buy-
ing will be more for the general longer-
term investor than the speculator.
To the more daring investor and
speculator, the shares may still provide a
challenge at present prices. There is
always the chance that the market has
underestimated the size of an issue. Then
again, there is also a chance of over-
estimation. In this case the likelihood
of overestimation is rather high, mainly
because of the extremely generous terms
of the previous issues.
J. WATTIE CANNERIES LTD.
An NZ Market Leader
A lthough the New Zealand share in-
dex has risen a further 8 p.c. this
year, J. Wattie Canneries Ltd, one of the
most-favored market leaders of recent
years, is selling 3d. below its 1963 clos-
ing price.
At the current 18s.NZ, the ss. shares
in this flourishing Hastings company,
which is by far New Zealand's largest
producer of canned and frozen vege-
tables, look a good buy because of the
promise of continued growth.
At this price, dividend return is 3.1
p.c. and earnings yield 6.2 p.c.
There are probably two reasons why
the sharemarket has not marked up
Wattie's in line with other first class
stocks. One is that the company has a
few times this year been the subject of
rumors about production difficulties,
which proved totally untrue. The other
is some doubt about the company’s
ability to maintain earning rate on higher
capital.
This doubt was, apparently, hot pre-
sent when eager buyers pushed up the
price to 18s. 9d. lasi year, after the
company had announced a 19 p.c. rise in
profits.
The rumors at one stage depressed
the shares to 16s. 9d. and the recovery
is obviously a difficult one for no ap-
parent reason. Since 1953, Wattie’s have
established an almost unrivalled growth
record, both in profitability and capital
gains, for its shareholders.
Following five cash issues and a one-
for-one bonus issue, those who bought
1000 shares late in 1953 would now
have 8400 shares worth £7560, against
an outlay of £2555. In the same period
dividend was raised from 6 to 11 p.c.
Expansion is still very strong, new
buildings at the company’s two factories,
in Hastings and Gisborne, being added
all the time to keep up with the growing
demand from a rapidly increasing popu-
lation. Moreover, consumer trends to-
wards canned and frozen products are in
Wattie’s favor.
The company makes about 90 lines
and employs four trawlers full-time.
Plant installed this year includes a new
can-making line which raised capacity
to 1080 cans a minute. This plant also
supplies cans for Leopard Breweries
the first in New Zealand to can beer.
Export markets for canned and frozen
vegetables and fish include Britain, Aust-
ralia, Malaysia, Canada and the Pacific
area.
Last year, sales rose by more than
£BOO,OOO to £4,454,636. Net profit repre-
sented a margin of 5.5 p.c. on this turn-
over. There seems no reason why this
sales increase should not continue at the
same pace in the current year. This
would provide sufficient additional pro-
fits to maintain earning rate on higher
ordinary capital at about the present rate.
The doubling of preference capital
last year and the raising of more long-
term fixed interest funds have improved
the gearing. This should be of benefit to
ordinary shareholders, the more so as the
company last year earned at the rate of
14.6 p.c. before tax on all funds em-
ployed. That left a handsome margin
after payment of interest.
Depreciation could well be higher this
year, but should be offset by tax con-
cessions on investment in new plant and
export development.
For this reason, profit should approach
the £300,000 mark in 1964, with further
increases a near-certainty.

WESTFIELD DEVELOPMENT CORPORATION LTD
Rapid Progress Maintained
Westfield Development Corpora-
tion Ltd continued its rapid pro-
gress during the 1963-64 financial year,
though the growth placed a strain on
the company’s working capital.
Twelve months ago the company was
particularly liquid, with more than
£125,115 in cash and £123,584 owing
for building work. During the latest
year the major part of these funds was
poured into new building projects.
Two additional investment projects
were added to the existing “portfolio”—
one at Dee Why and the other at East-
wood —both Sydney suburbs.
These contributed rental earnings for
about seven months of the year. The
Eastwood centre has been particularly
successful and is already expanding. A
large variety store is being added to the
centre for G. J. Coles and Co., which
already has a large food store in the
project.
Westfield joined the public company
list in August, 1960, with an issue of
300,000 ss. shares at par and 300,000
ss. notes carrying 9 p.c. interest. The
notes convert into ordinary shares on
July 1, 1965, but carry the right for
the holder to receive a cash repayment
if he so elects.
Since flotation, capital has increased
fairly rapidly with a one-for-four issue
at par in September, 1961, and a one-
for-two issue, also at par, in August,
1962.
Paid-up capital at last balance date
was £452,670, with an uncalled liability
of 2s. 6d. a ss. share, totalling £90,534,
arising from the 1962 issue.
Despite the growth of capital, earning
rate has been well maintained by steadily
rising profits. From 14.7 p.c. in the first
year of operation, it touched a peak
19.5 p.c. in 1962 and last year was 18.4
p.c. These have given a good cover to
the 10 p.c. dividends paid since flotation.
Growth planned for the current year
could well cause a call to be made on the
unpaid capital.
Plans have been prepared for another
extension to the shopping centre at
Hornsby, one of the company’s first pro-
jects. This will result in a doubling of
the rental area and a substantial increase
in parking space.
Work has already begun on two new
projects in the development field —a
supermarket and group of shops at
Baulkham Hills and a supermarket and
department store at Auburn. Work
should also start very soon on a shop-
ping centre at Figtree, near Wollongong.
In 1965, the company will begin work
°n its largest project so far, a regional
topping centre at Burwood in which
Mark Foy's Ltd will be the principal
tenant. This project should be finished
early in 1966.
These will keep the company fully
occupied for some time to come, for it
handles all aspects of the development—
the acquisition of the properties, the
design and construction of the buildings,
the leasing, management and promotion
of the centres.
Funds will be required for continual
progress, although most financing is be-
ing negotiated on satisfactory terms.
The latest accounts show that first
mortgage debenture borrowing has been
considerably reduced, standing at
£98,700 at June 30 last, with £41,200 to
be repaid before June 30 next. How-
ever, most development work has been
financed by long-term mortgages (which
at last balance date stood at £469,025),
sale and lease-back. Bank borrowing on
overdraft has been negligible.
The reserve position is strong, with
tax-free funds almost sufficient for a
one-for-four bonus issue. This is un-
likely to eventuate until earning rate is
lifted. Assets backing of each ss. share,
fully paid up, is 6s. lOd.
The shares are currently selling around
9s. 3d. to show a dividend yield of 5.4
p.c. The contributing shares are out of
line with this price, selling v at ss. 9d. —
making the cost of a share, when fully
paid, Bs. 3d. With the prospect of a
call imminent, these appear the best buy.
Similarly, the notes, which convert
into ordinary shares in a year’s time,
appear underpriced at Bs. in relation
to the fully paid shares. The dividend/
interest difference is only 1 p.c. over the
12 months, making this a cheaper way
into the company, with the additional
insurance of full capital refund in the
unlikely event of a disaster before June
30 next.

SPECULATOR’S DIARY
Expostulations with RMC
T cannot help but begin by releasing
some of my bitterness against the
latest move by the RMC board.
The public image of directors has
suffered badly by the high-handed actions
that this board has taken. Not that
directors in general are really appointed
by shareholders. Vacancies often fall con-
veniently between general meetings and
it simply becomes a case of confirmation
at the meeting itself.
But back to the RMC case. The joint
offer by CSR and Blue Metal was made
in June. A reply by the RMC directors
was made in July. Let me now review
that reply in the light of this latest
announcement and other developments
since.
First of all, the directors open up
their argument by saying: “Your direc-
tors and management over the years
have been quick to seize opportunities
for profitable development of the com-
pany to the advantage of the share-
holder.” Shareholders in recent years
will find this statement a difficult one
to swallow.
Then the argument continues: “The
success of such exploitation was demon-
strated late last year when the 52.8 p.c.
interest in Ready Mixed Concrete
(United Kingdom) Limited was sold for
£A7 million, giving a capital profit of
some £AS million, equivalent to more
than four years after-tax profit of
RMC.” Just two comments here. If
they had waited another six months, the
capital profit would have been £AI
million higher, just equal to what the
company has earned for the last twelve
months. (The UK shares have risen 20
p.c. since the begining of the year and
are now selling at 495. sterling.) And
my other remark is that instead of “four
years” it should have been “five years”.
The next paragraph states that “The
offeror companies know you (the share-
holder) have a very valuable asset, other-
wise they would not now be attempting
to take over the company.” Might I ask
what motivates most takeovers?
Then on to a really ironical heading:
“Tactics of the Offerors”!
The next heading is “Real Value of
the Offer”. Directors believe that share
prices of both CSR and Blue Metal were
inflated. Most certainly there was
support for Blue Metal at 275., but it
is unfair to say that CSR was overpriced
at 81s. At this price the shares had
a 7.5 p.c. earnings yield—well above the
average for leaders.
If they wanted to talk about inflated
share prices, they could have mentioned
the market price of RMC shares. After
making an adjustment for the 2s. return
of capital, it was 50 p.c. above the
market price early this year. For a
company whose profit has been the same
for four years, this is quite remarkable,
The final part of the report is devoted
to the difference in dividend of 25 p.c,
before and after the offer. However, if
the CSR board and the Blue Metal board
adopted the same policy as RMC in
paying out all profits (RMC’s dividend
requirement actually exceeded earnings
by £4700), then those shareholders
accepting the offer would almost double
their income return!
It seems incredible that RMC directors
were not aware in July that profits in
the month of June would be sub-
stantially down. Also, while they were
being so pally with shareholders, you
would have thought it might have
crossed their minds that the write-off of
capital losses of £1,200,000 should be
mentioned.
This write-off mystifies me. The
question is, why do it now?
My exasperation with the RMC board
was partly offset by two good profits,
totalling £239. Both ODE and William
Adams had shown smart rises, since they
were purchased last month.
I used the money to buy 500 G. E.
Crane. Not only had they announced
a 47 p.c. increase in profits but also a
one-for-five par issue.

THE MAN
ON THE LAND
“Double Compromise” Meat Bill
Farmers start to fight back
rpHE US Government behaved much as
expected in putting through the
“double compromise” Meat Bill. It seems
reasonable to refer to it as the “double
compromise” because it was, in fact, a
compromise on an already negotiated
compromise agreement.
In broad terms the implications are
well enough known now. The current
rate of US beef imports is about 860
million lbs. The estimated imports pos-
sible under the latest Bill, taking into
account the growth and tolerance fac-
tors, is about 930 million lbs a year.
The earlier compromise agreement
permitted imports of about 985 million.
Back in 1963. imports were running at
just over 1000 million lbs.
We have been dumped in the stock-
yard dust and let us not believe other-
wise.
Now might be a good time for some
sober reflection on the meat business. It
needs to be said that, as far as the
average farmer is concerned, the gravy
has been cold for some time.
What we mean is that the US market
related to the prices the farmer gets
in the sale ring here in Australia has
been gradually slipping since those heady
days in 1960 when old bulls were bring-
ing £l4O each (current price about £80).
It must be clearly understood that the
farmer does not do any exporting. Nei-
ther does the nation. The export business
is in the hands of private firms and there
are not that many of them.
This writer would be very interested
to see statistics of meat exports to the
US broken down into individual consign-
ments. A relatively small number of big
firms now export the greater part of the
total.
Representatives of these firms fre-
quently say that meat is intrinsically a
risky trade and that only organisations
such as theirs, with the experience and
contacts, can make a go of it. Maybe
they are right.
Just the same, the farmer seems
left out of it a little too much.
At the present time there is a move
afoot in Victoria, almost certain to be
followed up in other States, which could
mean more for the farmer, as an indi-
vidual, than the cut-back in exports to
America.
A conference called recently by the
Victorian Minister for Agriculture, Mr
“Gib” Chandler, discussed proposals put
forward by primary producer bodies
that stock should be weighed before sale
at auction. The conference was attended
by Department officials, representatives
of producer bodies, and officials from
some of the major marketing centres.
The discussion indicated that a
system of weighing cattle at the
saleyard had proved successful in overseas
countries (notably USA), as it enabled
both buyer and seller to assess more
accurately the value of the stock being
sold. The conference, with some of the
marketing representatives disagreeing,
resolved that it was desirable to intro-
duce at Victorian cattle markets a system
of weighing slaughter and store cattle so
that they could be sold by auction on a
live weight basis.
A committee was appointed to investi-
gate, as early as possible, the cost involved
in the purchase, installation and opera-
tion of suitable scales at both metro-
politan and country markets and to pre-
pare a programme by which the pro-
posals could be implemented.
The committee is made up of repre-
sentatives of the Victorian Wheat and
Woolgrowers’ Association, the Victorian
division of the Australian Primary Pro-
ducers’ Union, the Victorian Graziers’
Association, the Hamilton United Pro-
ducers’ Committee, the Stock and Sta-


tion Agents’ Association, and the Muni-
cipal Association of Victoria. The
Department of Agriculture will provide
the facilities for meetings and will take
part in the investigations.
“Gib” Chandler is getting a reputation
as a man who gets things done. It may
be remembered that he got a guarantee
from the Victorian Government to con-
tinue financial support for the tractor
testing station at Werribee before the
Commonwealth Department of Primary
Industry weighed in. His move un-
doubtedly helped save the day for the
station.
There will certainly be some opposi-
tion to this idea of weighing cattle and
it is not exactly a new idea. It has been
mentioned in these pages previously.
Some of the producer bodies have been
campaigning for it for years. This new
move, however, looks more likely to get
results than anything in the past.
Weighing of cattle before auction is
sound common sense, and it is fair and
reasonable. Australian stock markets
are, too many of them anyway, antiqua-
ted and sorely in need of better facili-
ties.
Installation of scales should not be
over-expensive. The cost would be
reduced if they were embodied in the
rebuilding plans already in store for
many of the major markets.
Lack of scales has resulted in far too
much emphasis on quickness of the eye
on the part of buyers operating for a
decreasing number of distributors. Years
ago every butcher bought his own beef
and killed it, or had it killed, and com-
petition was keen.
The trend now is towards fewer and
bigger distributors supplying meat to the
retail butchers. The biggest of these
firms have consolidated their position
further by establishing their own grazing
properties, slaughtering facilities, small-
goods outlets and retail shops.
There are strong rumors of link-ups
with supermarket chains in the offing.
The prospects, for those in it, of super-
market selling of foodstuffs are said to
be dazzling.
These things do not necessarily mean
that the farmer is being taken down.
But weighing of cattle before auction
is one very obvious advantage the far-
mer is denied at present.
What of the consumer who, in the
end, is the person who counts most of
all?
Per capita consumption of beef in
Australia is the second highest in the
world, but, nevertheless, has declined
since 1939. The consumer would cer-
tainly eat more beef if he could afford
it. Provided beef (and lamb) can be
kept at a reasonable price, the prospects
of meat raising are very good for as far
ahead as anyone can see.
What was attractive about the US
market was not that it was a market
which wanted our beef —the whole world
is hungry for beef —but the fact that it
was a market prepared to pay the price.
That part of the price which eventually
found its way into the pocket of the
farmer might be more than made up by
expansion of the home market, together
with exports to Britain and other parts
of the world from time to time.
It does seem that the export of meat is
open to more drastic fluctuations than
other primary products. If, as the big
exporters claim, they, and they alone,
can cope with these fluctuations, then
they should have nothing to fear from
any move designed to give the farmer a
better hope of stabilising his costs.
For this reason, therefore, the pro-
gress which the Victorian committee
makes on the weighing of stock will be
watched with keen interest. So will the
opposition, if, and when, it is voiced.
When Nauru Is Depleted
Searching for alternative fertilisers
HThe rejection by the Nauruans of Curtis
Island as a possible future home
focuses attention on the long-range impli-
cations for Australian agriculture. Whe-
ther the islanders eventually settle some-
where else, or stay on Nauru, this coun-
try owes them a debt and must try to
help them.
Without superphosphate, which is
manufactured from the phosphate rock
deposits on Nauru, this country would
be agriculturally backward.
Over the last 50 years, superphosphate
has been mainly responsible for the im-
provement of pastures. This improve-
ment must continue if production is to be
even maintained, let alone increased.
By 1980 the rock deposits on Nauru
will be seriously depleted. The search
for alternative fertilisers therefore be-
comes urgent.
It would seem that the answer must lie
in alternatives, because the nearest
known deposits of phosphate rock, other
than present Australian sources on Nau-
ru and Christmas Island (Indian Ocean),
are in South Africa and South America.
The transport costs from there would
always be high.
Certainly there will be superphosphate
available for a long time after Nauru
cuts out. It is the cost of manufacturing
it, and getting it on to the pastures, which
is the important factor.
The Australian chemical industry
might provide the answer, so no time
should be lost in encouraging research
and experiments. Likewise it would ap.
pear that an intensive search of the Aus-
tralian continent similar to the search
for oil would be warranted.
In Canada two years ago a huge, pre-
viously untapped source of potash was
discovered in Saskatchewan. This potash
deposit is now being mined and con-
verted into fertiliser. Some small ship,
ments have already reached Australia
and New Zealand.
New Zealand, probably more pasture-
improvement conscious than Australia,
is reported to be contemplating big pur-
chases.
The potash deposits under the Cana-
dian prairie required a determined and
imaginative effort before they could be
utilised. Forty million dollars were spent
in dropping bores, defining the extent of
the deposit, and developing mining mach-
inery.
The geology of the region at least
suggests that there might be similar pos-
sibilities here. The Canadian deposit lies
3000 feet under shale and limestone in
what was, millions of years ago, a huge
inland sea.
Apart from natural deposits, the manu-
facture of synthetic fertilisers presents
enormous possibilities. But before we get
carried away we ought to recall that Rus-
sia with a chemical industry far
greater than ours —is in trouble over
the lack of fertilisers for her wheatlands.
Again, it is largely a question of cost.
Fertilisers supplied by the US chemi-
cal industry are one of the main reasons
for the tremendous farm yields in the
US and also one of the main reasons
for the high-cost structure.
Currently exciting interest in the US
is a new range of phosphate fertilisers
known as the polyphosphates. They per-
form pretty much as does superphosphate
but are more concentrated and get quick-
er results.
Ammonium polyphosphate and cal-
cium polyphosphate are further develop-
ments and have the advantage that they
combine fertilising agents which, at pre-
sent, have to be applied separately.
The “package deal” fertiliser, that is
one which combines all the necessary
or desired agents, is the aim of research
workers in the US and they are well
along the way. Liquid nitrogen fertilisers
are also a big thing in American farming.
The application of fertilisers in liquid
form in this country is in its infancy and
appears to be held up solely by high
costs. These should come down as vol-
ume increases.
For the agricultural chemist in Aus-
tralia the field seems to be wide open. It
is to be hoped he gets proper encourage-
ment.

“The Disease of Dirty Hands”
Checking the onslaught of hydatids
Nowhere in the world, except in the
South Island of New Zealand, is
there a higher incidence of hydatids than
in the great sheep-raising, areas of Vic-
toria’s Wimmera and Western District.
Yet, with proper care, hydatids can be
checked by breaking the life cycle of
the parasite responsible, a tapeworm
three-sixteenths of an inch long, Echino-
coccus granulosus, which is present in
the intestines of many dogs.
Affected dogs void hundreds of eggs
of these tapeworms in yards, vegetable
patches, dams and paddocks, where the
wind helps their wider distribution
among sheep. The eggs can survive
drying and freezing. When inadvertently
swallowed by sheep, cattle, pigs, men,
women and children, they complete their
life cycle, sometimes with fatal results
to their human host. Dogs, sheep,
cattle and pigs normally suffer much
less seriously.
The young tapeworm, when hatched,
burrows through the stomach wall and,
carried in the bloodstream, settles to
form a cyst, usually in lungs or liver.
There, unsuspected, it may develop to
serious proportions. Only for the acci-
dent of a broken rib puncturing a cyst in
his lung, a Balmoral (Vic.) footballer
would not have learned why he had, for
six months, felt so “off color”. That
chance discovery, and the consequent
surgical removal of the potentially
dangerous cyst, amply compensated for
the six weeks’ inaction due to the acci-
dent.
Daughter cysts may form inside the
original one, break away and settle else-
where in the body, eventually causing
serious illness, perhaps even death, unless
the condition is recognised in time.
Surgical removal of advanced hydatids
cysts can be very risky.
When a dog fed on raw offal from
farm-slaughtered sheep eats a hydatids
cyst, the tapeworm matures in its in-
testines and lays its hundreds of eggs,
which, voided in the natural course,
spread hydatids further. Any campaign
against hydatids, then, should begin with
the dog.
All sheepdogs should be treated every
three months with arecoline hydrobro-
mide, the usual dose being one-and-a-half
grains for large dogs, one grain for
medium-sized dogs and half a grain for
small dogs and puppies. After being
dosed the dog should be walked around
until it purges. The matter purged
should then be burned to destroy any
tapeworms and eggs present. As a fur-
ther precaution, offal should be cooked
before being fed to dogs.
Since great numbers of eggs may still
be scattered about the farm, all those
working with sheep and dogs should
scrupulously wash their hands after such
contact, particularly before handling
food. It is with good reason that the
French call hydatids “the disease of
dirty hands”. All vegetables, especially
salads, that could possibly be contami-
nated by dogs should also be carefully
washed before they are used.
LETTER TO THE EDITOR
Tobacco Industry’s Instability
Sir,
Your “Man on the Land” writer
(August 22) does not appear to possess
a profound knowledge of the tobacco
industry.
There is much truth in the statement
that the small primary producer with no
capital has not got a chance these days.
The same can be said of the big producer
with limited experience. Both types have
contributed greatly to the industry’s prob-
lems in recent years.
A brief study of the industry’s past
will show that small producers have,
collectively, contributed more to its
development than the big men. The big
tobacco grower is a comparatively new
development which has led to the ex-
ploitation of the industry and the abuses
of the share-farmer system.
I must take your writer to task for his
statement, “as far as manufacturers are
concerned, all Australian tobacco is sus-
pect . . . they would prefer cheaper and
better leaf from USA or South Africa.”
It is readily admitted that part of the
Australian crop is of low quality but it
is pure nonsense to assert that the bulk
of the crop falls into this category. No
tobacco-producing country has yet found
a way to produce a crop of 100 p.c.
quality leaf. Even the USA, referred to
as a source of better leaf, has a very
serious quality problem as well as accu-
mulated stocks of unsold leaf totalling
over seven hundred million pounds
weight.
Excluding the current selling season,
which has not yet been completed, 1961
was the worst year experienced by Aus-
tralian tobacco growers, market-wise. In
that year, 18 p.c. or 5,000,000 pounds
of the crop remained unsold and, of that
Quantity, almost 20 p.c. eventually found
its way into manufacturers’ stocks in spite
of arguments about quality. A substan-
d part of this leaf was produced in
"Astern Australia, southern New South
Wales and the Burdekin area of North
Queensland. These areas are now out of
production.
Another erroneous impression given
by this article is that manufacturers are
compelled to use a stipulated percentage
of Australian leaf in their blends. There
is no compulsion other than a financial
incentive which, under the present sys-
tem, becomes progressively less as usage
of domestic leaf increases.
Having been generous in dealing out
the brickbats, I offer your writer a
bouquet for drawing attention to what
appears to be one of the underlying
reasons for the near-riot in Melbourne.
There can be no doubt that the manner
in which some share-farmers are being
exploited reflects no credit on the indus-
try. It is to be hoped that the projected
stabilisation plan will lessen these abuses.
In the same issue of The Bulletin,
(page 17), David McDougall claimed
that the tobacco industry’s problem is
over-production. This is a very super-
ficial assessment of the position. Austra-
lians consume some 52 million pounds
of tobacco annually. The current crop
is expected to yield about 30 million
pounds (dried weight), so that we are
producing less than 60 p.c. of Australia’s
requirements.
