known Dispensary that now bears his name, re-
ceived his medical education in the leading colleges
and hospitals of Europe. He has devoted a life-
time to the study of
PRIVATE, NERVOUS. AND SKIN
DISEASES.
He has by profound research thoroughly investi-
gated their origin, traced their deadly sources and
insidious dissemination, and ascertained the surest
and safest methods by which they may bo eradi-
cated, with these widely recognised qualifications
combined with unswerving faithfulness to his
patients, he has during his practice, extending
over FORTY YEARS, attained a well-deserved
pre-eminence in their treatment. His practice
embraces diseases which probably cause more un-
happiness than any other class of troubles that
affliefc mankind.

some poor friend to health even after his case has
been pronounced incurable by his medical at-
tendant.
ONE POUND IS SUFFICIENT TO
SEND
for Remedies necessary for the cure of NER-
VOUS DEBILIT Y. Should you require medical
treatment, as procrastination is sometimes dan-
gerous, it would be advisable for you to sit down
quietly in your chamber and write to the doctor,
detailing every experienced symptom. He will
on receipt of such a letter, write you, promptly
and courteously, a candid and straightforward
oponion of your case. If you do not think you
understand the case, send for his famous medical
work, the price of which is but sixpence ; enclosed
in the volume will be found a bst of carefully-pre-
pared questions, which will, in all probability,
assist you materially in describing your ailment.
Dr. Richards uses nothing but the purest remedies,
and never prescribes mercury under any circum-
stances. The moment letters are carefully per-
used and answered they are destroyed by lire,
and patients may rest assured that their cases
will remain a secret between the doctor and
themselves. Dr. Richards has successfully treated
nearly 25,000 cases since coming to Australia, and
has permission from at least 10,000 persons to
show their wrilten evidence of his success. All

tralia and Queensland, are once more attract-
ing the attention of the omnivorous British
financier. In each case a syndicate is desirous
of taking over the work and completing it
upon the land-grant principle, and, judging
from present appearances, the chances for
both syndicates are good. South Australia
has long been hungering to possess a railroad
right across the continent, and for many
years that impoverished province wasted
its substance in laying iron rails further
and further out into the tenantless wilder-
ness. It was a miserably unprofitable specu-
lation, when once the railway left the
confines of civilisation and stretched out into
regions where there was but one line-repairer
and a dingo to the square mile—where there
were neither passengers nor freight nor mails
nor any other kind of traffic whatsoever.
But the people of Adelaide had accepted it
as an axiom that their future depended on
the completion of the line, and they stuck to
the work manfully till the great depression
came, and their gigantic undertaking fell
down dead at Hergott Springs, with 1000
miles of empty desert still unbridged. Since
then the South Australians have sat discon-
solate among the ruins of their fallen ambi-
tion, but their morbid and unhealthy desire
for a great, useless, cumbersome, lonely
transcontinental line has never once abated.
As for the Queensland enterprise, it was
started under different auspices. M‘ll-
wraith advocated it first in his unregenerate
days, and conceived the great idea of having
it built by the agency of an English com-
pany, and there was to be a land-boom in
the North, and the greatest land-swindle
“Scotch colloquialism” —of the cen-
tury was looming up in perspective. Then
Griffith squashed the vast project, and
started to do the work on the old basis
by means of borrowed capital, but the job
died a natural death, for no one really
seemed to want the line or to have any use
for it whatsoever. After that MTlwraitii
found salvation, and made his calling and re-
election sure, and abjured nigger-labour and
land-grant railways together. And next he
lost his salvation again, and so did Griffith,
and to-day the Kanaka and the land-grant
system—both now under the patronage of
To.muel Griffilwraith —arc both looming
up once more'mi the immediate horizon, and
British syndicates are again negotiating to
secure the richest lands in the North gratis,
and be paid for taking them, and to pose as
public benefactors thereby.

The land grant system is based on the
assumption that Australia must continue to
build more railways in less time than any
other State in the civilised world, as the only
means of maintaining its prosperity. If it
cannot get them on the present system of
State-ownership, then it must do it by
giving away the monopoly to private specu-
lators, and if it cannot give away the mono-
poly, then the speculators must be paid to
take it. In either case it is accepted as a
self-evident axiom that the country must
keep on building new lines at a red-hot
pace. Australia, at the present time, has a
greater extent of railway, in proportion to
population, than any other country on the
face of the earth, with the one possible
exception of the United States, and the
cause of this immediate necessity is hard to
discover. Every lino that offers any reason-
able prospect of yielding a profit this
century has already been constructed, and
so, also, has every one which promises to be
only a moderate loss. The S.A. transcon-
tinental scheme is not wanted ; it is merely
a project for opening-up communication
where there is no one to communicate,
and for carrying passengers and freight
where there are neither freight nor passen-
gers to bo carried. There is something
imposing in the idea of building a steel
highway right across a continent, but so far
as present necessities are concerned it is just
as useful as the idea of opening public
libraries all round the Gulf of Carpentaria.
The Queensland scheme is still less
essential ; it is merely a device where-
by an utterly bankrupt nation may
be furnished with facilities for travelling into
a ghastly region of blight and malaria and
alligators, which hardly one single sane
human being really desires to visit. If any
ordinary inhabitant rvere deposited at the
proposed terminus of either line, he would
sooner walk back than stay there, and sooner
die than walk back. Australia doesn’t want
to give away a vast amount of valuable pro-
perty to induce any foreign monopolists to
build a line to either place ; it doesn’t want
to build the lines on the ordinary system of
State ownership ; it doesn’t even want to get
them for nothing. If it received two trans-
continental roads gratis it would find it
cheaper, under presentconditions, tosell them
for old iron than to work them. The frenzied
desire for railways everywhere, at any cost,
and utterly irrespective of population, is
just as insane as the old Dutch frenzy for
tulips, when roots fetched several hundred
pounds apiece. From this day forward Aus-
tralia needs to build its lines out of revenue
only, and to build them just as fast as
revenue will allow. 'When it will not allow,
the country should get out and walk.
* # *
The ostensible object of the present system
of railway construction is to “open up the
country.” In other words, the country con-
structs, at a vast expenditure of borrowed
money, a new lino through some howling
waste, and is thus enabled to sell the land
along the route, which would otherwise be, for
the time, unsaleable. The entire proceeds of
the land are absorbed in the course of years
to pay interest on the cost of construction,
and the loss on working expenses comes out
of the consolidated revenue. The country
thus, through its haste, gives away the public
estate to buy a dead loss and an incubus, and
is worse off than if it had never owned either
the land or the incubus. The “ opening up
of the country ” makes rooixx for new hordes
of British paupers- who are sometimes
xictually imported at the cost of the State, in
order that the newly-opexxed regions may not
remain tenantless ; and lands which will be
urgently wanted to provide room for the
coming generations of Australians are
muddled away at great expense so as to
hasten, in the name of progress, the time
when our sons will be overcrowded and
hoxneless in their ownr country. To get rid
of the public estate by this process it costs,
probably, from first to last, nearly twice as
nxuch as that estate is worth, and among
these nxultiplied losses there is oxxe, and only
one, item of profit - the nation in the end is
one railway ahead. It may be a dead loss
for 20 years, but at all events it is there.
When everything else is gone in financial
riot and confusion, the great white elephant
at least remains.
# # *
This is the Australian system as applied to
such outlying lines as the two great tx’ans-
continental highways. The land grant device
is a modification of the same principle, the
difference consisting chiefly in the fact that
the country, in this instance, does not get
the railway. Dix-ectly or indix’ectly the
nation suffers all the losses attendant on the
ordinary plan of State-construction and State-
ownership, and the only asset in the whole
transaction goes to the syndicate. The methods
of the British speculators who propose to
take up the unfinished enterprise at Hergott
Springs are beautiful in their simplicity.
They ax*e to x-cccive, in the first place, an
immense ax-ea of land —almost all the really
valuable property, in fact, along the lino.
The capital required for construction pur-
poses w ill be raised by mortgaging this land
in England—the speculators themselves do
not propose to put up one single coin from
first to last. When the line is finished,
therefore, the syndicate will possess 1000
miles of railway and an estate as largo as a
good-sized kingdom, less the mortgage lia-
bility ; and they will have received these
two assets for absolutely nothing. And as
that mortgage is secured upon the soil of
Australia, this country will owe the amount
as absolutely as if it had been raised on
Government debentures. If the value of
the line is £10,000,000, then the situation,
at the conclusion of the work, would, under
the system of Government ownership, be
this: the State would owe £10,000,000,
and possess an asset which cost the same
amount as a set-off. Under the syndicate
system the country would have parted with
property worth at least £15,000,000 —it must
be worth that amount else no syndicate
could reckon confidently on raising
£10,000,000 upon the security—and would
have nothing whatever as compensation.
The primary recommendation of the land-
grant system is that it provides means of com-
munication—generally in some inaccessible
region where no sane man really wants to
communicate—without inflicting a burden on
the nation ; the reality is that it greatly in-
creases the burden on the nation, while some
foreign speculators get the entire assets.
The British monopolist kindly proposes to
take the land and the transcontinental rail-
way without paying anything for either, and
therefore it is obvious that somebody must
pay, and the Australian people, as the only
other parties to the nefarious transaction,
are necessarily the ones who will bear the
liability.
• # *
The new line, in the hands of the State,
would doubtless be a loss for at least the
first decade. On the State railways the
people practically fix the rates, and as they
generally fix them below the paying limit
the result is a chronic deficiency. Then the
deficiency is made good out of the consoli-
dated revenue, and the nation pays its own
bill in another shape. The syndicate, having
no consolidated revenue to fall back upon,
will charge such rates as will make the line
self-supporting ; and thus the people, having
first given away the land, and secondly
given away the railway, will make good
all after deficiencies for the British speculator
just as they would otherwise do for them-
selves. The syndicate’s land Avill necessarily
be sold to all comers in order to create
traffic. Some of it Avill doubtless be traded
off’in this country, and someAvill be disposed
of, by dint of much hard lying, to foreign
settlers. If General Booth chooses to pur-
chase, and desires to settle his thousands of
broken-doAvn criminals on the transcontinen-
tal line, or Hiesch wants to exj ort his host
of unclean Russian Jews, the local Govern-
ment will have no option save to admit
these obnoxious hordes ; having authorised
the syndicate to sell it cannot reasonably
shut out the purchasers, Avhoever they may
be. To all intents and purposes the Govern-
ment will have surrendered its right to
exclude objectionable colonists ; Avhen the
syndicate has had time to consolidate its
political influence—after the manner of the
railroad magnates Avho now run the United
States and carry the Senate in their carpet-
bags—and has duly bought up the Legisla-
ture, even the Chinamen will find an
entrance without much difficulty. The
reason of at least one-half the railroads that
are now constructed is to absorb surplus
labour, but the English company will,
almost to a certainty, import its labour—
paitly for the sake of cheapness, partly
Avith a view to settling its employes along
the line and selling its allotments to them.
Sundry politicians will get a share in the
profits, and there the advantage will end.
Queensland and South Australia will have
sold their souls for a transcontinental line,
and both the souls and the line will go to
the omnivorous syndicate.
* * *
And at the end we come back to the grue-
some anomaly Avith which we started—there
is no demand for these ruinous Avorks what-
soever. They are to be constructed in a
lonesome wilderness Avhich no more requires
a railway at the present time than it does a
marble cathedral. The lines Avill open-up
the country, but they will open it up for the
syndicate only, and Avhereas the Australians
now own the land in an undeveloped state,
they will then cease to own it altogether.
There is not one redeeming feature in the
Avhole unmitigated swindle. lire money
which the British company borrows to carry
out its enterprise will,be orved by, and must
ultimately be paid by, Australia, just as truly
as if it had been borrowed on Government
debentures, for the company will meet its
debentures with money extracted somehow
from this country, and the Government
could do no more. The loss Avhich would
naturally ensue through running a super-
fluous means of conveyance in a thinly-
peopled country will be made good by the
nation as much as if the work were its own,
for the company must get its revenue out of
Australia or burst, and a fraud of such
dimensions seldom bursts. The profits,
Avhen they begin, will go to England.
Having already paid for its railway, this
country, if it wants to own it, must buy it
from the company and pay for it a second
time in cash. If it wants to recover the
lands which it gave away, and to abolish
landlordism, it must buy them back—pro-
bably at three times their original value,
and their original value being probably 50
per cent, over that of the line, this will be
equivalent to paying for that famous institu-
tion four-and-a-half times more. And having
thus paid for its transcontinental road nearly
six times over, the country will be six times
Averse off than if it had constructed that
famous monument of progress on its own
responsibility in the first instance! and also
much woise off than if there had never been
any such monument at all. Truly there is a
great future in store fur the land-grant
railway industry.
A Vote for “Fixity.”
Epps, the “ cokum ” man, who explains U)ings
for the New South Wales “ National” Associa-
tion, is still doing his fatal work in the daily
papers, and unless the Association can hire
somebody to explain Epps, that gentleman’s
talent for ethical confusion will presently bring
his employers to grief. It is one of the truly
fiendish characteristics of this particular gather-
ing of capitalists that it is always expounding
its political platform, and its expositions are
just as clear as might be expected from an idiot
head downwards in a mud-hole. When it com-
menced its career under the asgis of Tommy Kelly,
the rich and dignified ex-storeman in theglitter-
ingly new Avhitetile, the Association advocated,
openly and boldly, the retention of the present
system of plural voting as a reward for the
ownership of land or bricks and mortar, and it
called this a means for the encouragement of
Thrift. It assumed, with the fatuousness of
the Epps who rushes in where angels fear to
tread, (1) that land and houses are always got
by Thrift and never by inheritance, by swin-
dling, open robbery, gambling, lying, land-
jumping, or political treachery; (2) t hat the
want of land and houses is always conclusive
evidence of want of Thrift, and that poverty
never arises through sickness, low wages, want
of work, the possession of a large family,
through being swindled in a bank, or building
society, or financial company, through drought,
combustion, lightning, hail, floods, pestilence,
sudden death, excessive good-nature, or any
other cause whatever ; (3) that Thrift is
the only virtue worth encouraging, and
that benevolence, filial affection, honesty,
patriotism and all the rest are not worth men-
tioning ; (4) that land and houses are the only
possible evidence of Thrift; and (5) that the
thrifty man is always a good law-maker and the
thriftless man a bad one. These were the theories
on which the association travelled in the early
stages of its career, but when Epps had explained
himself concerning them, his taskmasters broke
out in an altogether fresh place. Therefore,
Epps writes to the papers now to suggest that
every man should have one vote, that the
thrifty man should have one extra vote, and that
the evidences of thrift which shall qualify for
that additional suffrage shall be as follows :
Any evidence of a man’s thrift should be included under
the term. With the squatter’s station should be included
the artisan’s cottage, savings bank account, life insurance
policy, a Crown lease or section, length of residence for a
certain term in one tenement or electorate (which indi-
cates fixity and stability), and a thousand and one other
matters, all of which are evidences of a man’s 1, -ake or
interest in the country.
* * *
No doubt Epps, as he goes horribly on his
Avay down the dreary columns of the S.M.
Hkkald, is quite serious in the suggestion that
a man should have an extra vote for living a
long time in one house, because it “ indicates
fixity and stability.” And it never dawns
upon him that it may mean not stability, but
only paralysis. A paralytic generally hangs
out for a great length of time in one house,
because lie is difficult to move. So docs a
dropsical patient, and a person without legs,
and a bedridden individual with a small
annuity. They have no more “stability ” than
the average of humanity, but they move with
difficulty, and are inert by nature. This trait
is one which they share with the homicide, who
demonstrates bis fixity by being for a great
length of time in one gaol, or the lunatic who
remains for 42 jears in the same asylum. The
homicide and the lunatic would undoubtedly
be entitled to a vote for “ fixity Columbus,
if he were alive to-day, would not —he was an
unstable and unfixed person, who would have
lost his vote by going away to discover
America. The same disability would attend
pretty nearly every other man who ever left a
huge and indelible footprint on the sands of
time—every apostle who stormed the world
with a new creed, every great missionary,
soldier, explorer, politician, writer—for no man
can write well who has not seen the world,
every artist —unless he is willing to spend his
whole life in painting the view from his frofit
window, every zoologist, botanist, geologist—
everybody, in short, who has ever done any-
thing worth remembering or recording. There
is no stability or fixity among them all.
And why Epps should want people to be
“fixed” in this unnatural manner is difficult
to imagine. For some unexplainable reason he
desires to confer a double share of political power
on the fossil who has locked the same back door
after putting out the same cat every night for
twenty years—who has grown thick-headed and •
blue-moulded through looking out of the same
window at the same back yard—who has dozed
in the same chimney-corner, and got his beer
from the same public-house, and gabbled to the
same neighbour over the same fence, and bought
his gory beefsteak from the same butcher for
two decades or more. In what way the voter
is improved by this long era of dull, dead
monotony, or how Epps is the better for it. are
two absolutely insoluble problems. ■
» • «
Even granting, however, that a “ fixed ”
person is better, in some mysterious way, than
one who is not fixed, and that the stable voter
has lived for many years in one house from high
patriotic motives, and not because the corpse of
his first wife’s aunt is buried and bricked in
under the hearth-stone and he is afraid to move
lest the next tenant should find her bones, and
assuming that Epps has a right to interfere in
the matter, it still remains to be seen whether
this particular test of fixity is the true one.
The man who has lived long in one tenement
may be “stable,” but all stability does not
necessarily develope in this direction. The
person who hasn’t had his hair cut for a long
time also manifests stability in another form,
and so does the one who has neglected to change
his collar for a lengthened period. The man
who has pawned his watch regularly for many
years with thesame“ uncle,” and the one who has
taken in the same paper for a whole generation,
and the individual who has held on to the same
batch of unprofitable mining scrip longer than
anybody else, and the heavy, melodramatic
father who has turned his daughter out of doors
and kept her out for a great length of time, are
all characters who arc gifted with much fixity,
and ought to have an extra vote in consequence.
The poet who sends the same rejected mass o *


verse for years round the whole of the Austra-
lian press, and finally, in his old age, inserts it
as an advertisement, is the most fixed indivi-
dual we know of, and compared to him even the
gentleman who lives in one house for four
centuries is loose, unreliable, and shaky. The
monomaniac is also a person of great stability,
and the manner in which he dings to his
one delusion assuredly deserves special
recognition. The living curse who sings
one song all his life and generally
sings it horribly—is at least as worthy of
reward as the inhabitant who vegetates to a
great age without shifting his residence, and
the dull, fat man—we know him well—who
has made the same joke every day for 30 years,
is also deserving of consideration. Further,
we put in a plea for the man who doesn’t change
his linen ; if the fossil who stays for ever in one
tenement thereby earns the gratitude of his
country, the one who stays for ever in one shirt
should not be forgotten. Fixity, at the best, is
a poor, mean kind of virtue, rather better than
hiccup and a shade worse than ordinary ignor-
ance, but even at the worst it is advisable to
make sure that the right kind of fixity is
rewarded and not an altogether sham or bogus
variety. A bit of brown paper is not much to
whoop over, but a counterfeit bit of brown
paper is still worse, and it is plainly the counter-
feit article which Epps has got hold of.
PLAIN ENGLISH.
Desertions, Grass-Widows, and Bigamy.
Last year, in the city of Sydney and its
suburbs, there were celebrated some 3500 mar-
riages. In the same year and the same district,
according to the report of the Benevolent
Asylum authorities, there were ex-celebrated
623 wife-desertions, that being the number
reported to the police; allowing for husband
desertions, and cases where the neglected
female did not report the matter to the authori-
ties, the number might, in all probability, be
safely estimated at 800 or 900. This is a
serious item to go against the marriage record,
and on a rough estimate it would appear that
in the New South Wales metropolis and its
environs every fourth husband bolts habitually
and leaves his family unprovided for. The
Sydney Daily Telegraph, with its customary
incapacity for arithmetic, disputes this calcula-
tion, on the ground that “ the number of
deserters in a year are not drawn from the
number of couples married during that period,
but from the whole population,” but this only
asserts that a husband seldom runs away in the
first year of his marriage ; the one indisputable
fact is that, so long as there are 3500 marriages
and 800 or 900 desertions per annum, one
husband out of every four mysteriously van-
ishes, or elopes, or otherwise goes away and
fails to come back. These surprising figures
open up a lot of probabilities. In Sydney,
every tenth person is a married—or nominally
married —-female, and thus every fortieth per-
son is a deserted wife. Allowing for her
absconding husband and the four deserted
children—which is below the real average
—it would thus appear that one person
in every eight has either unlawfully
bolted or been unlawfully bolted from. The
number of husbands who disappear from the
city of Sydney and its environs is, according
to these calculations, nearly twice as many as
the number who die, therefore, when any rash
individual marries an alleged widow, it is at
the very least an even chance that the lady is
committing bigamy—it might even be put
down as a two to one chance, but we are
anxious to err on the safe side. This is a
serious drawback, and should be duly con-
sidered by all men who want to marry widows.
Similarly, the lady who marries a widower
takes an ecpial risk, which is another serious
drawback. The number of accumulated
bigamists who are loose upon the soil of New
South Wales must be something tremendous,
and the fact that the marriage-rate of the
province is higher than that of any European
State, with the single exception of Hungary,
is probably accounted for by this unnatural
tendency of the population to keep on marrying
regardless of expense. These estimates are, of
course, based on the assumption that each hus-
band only absconds once, and that each wife is
only once deserted. .There are, no doubt,
hardened or habitual vanishers wdio have left a
■whole succession of disconsolate wives, and
committed bigamy over and over again, and on
the other hand there are probably certain
ladies who, owing to ugliness, great power of
jaw, bad cookery, fits, extravagance, drink, or
a tendency to stay out late at night, have been
quitted by a long series of husbands ; and these
may reduce, in some degree, the actual number
of absconders, grass-widows, and bigamists,
though without, in any way, reducing the
aggregate criminality. So far, no one seems to
have advanced any reasonable theory as to how
this great difficulty is to be met. There are no
visible signs or evidences by which the law-
breaker can be detected in time, and, to all
appearance, the process of wife-desertion will
go on throughout Australia until the continent
is filled with bigamists, and widows who are
not widows, and alleged bachelors who are not
bachelors, and infants who have been left on
a cold, hard world, unfriended and alone,
ft every bride and bridegroom were to be
solemnly branded by the parson or the registrar
with a red-hot poker, somewhere between the
shoulder-blades, it might possibly meet the
difficulty, but such a remedy would probably
be found too severe. And the only other
course seems to be to let things slide, and to
allow everybody to marry as often as he or she
may f ee j inclined —which will, doubtless, be
pretty frequently.
■
fiiiK National Mutual Life Association of Aus-
tralia was, in The Bulletin’s opinion, unwise
to defend the action brought against it by the
widow of a client who had insured for £4OO, on
_bo ground that the insurer, while suffering
rom an internal tumour, had declared himself
J V e > 80 for as ho knew, in good health, he
having also been passed as a “good life” by
Die Association’s doctor. The rational principle
that should guide life-insurance societies seems
to be that they should face all risks and conse-
quences once they have accepted a policy and
taken its current premium. Every experienced
doctor professionally disbelieves, or at least
doubts, pretty nearly everything that a
patient tells him. Insurance-societies should
recognise this common idiosyncrasy and
deal with it as a matter of pure business,
according to the now well - understood
law of probabilities. After all, the question
resolves itself into a problem of actuarial
averages, and, when thus scientifically dealt
with, there is no more risk of loss on the yross
insurances in insuring (say) 1000 sick people
than there is in insuring 1000 apparently
healthy persons. A year or two ago, when the
Queensland Government proposed to enforce
compulsory life-insurance on every member of
its Civil Service, one big insurance company
offered special terms for the privilege of being
allowed to insure the lot, sickly and strong,
young and old, paralytic and springy, without
medical examination, it being held that the
observance of a scientific law of averages would
make the enterprise not only safe, but remunera-
tive. A life policy, once granted, should be as
indefeasible as a promissory-note, and should be
made so by law. Until this reform is estab-
lished and rigidly adhered to, insurance com-
panies must remain more or less objects of
popular distrust.
The numerous Australian law-students, who
are “ eating dinners ” in London to qualify for
the English bar, are “much disheartened” at
the new Victorian Amalgamation Act, under
which a solicitor is virtually also a barrister
and a barrister is additionally a solicitor :
If a certificate of call to the English bar is no longer
sufficient to qualify for admission to the Victorian bar,
the students hold that it is waste of time to come home
(meaning h ingland) to study, as it would be infinitely
better to be articled in the first instance to a colonial
barrister.
Hear, hear. If the Victorian Act effects no
other result than the establishment of an inde-
pendent Australian bar, that seeks no foreign
imprimatur, we shall have much to be thankful
for.
The gorgeous confusion of the S.M. Herald :
What, then, is a Freetrader? Is he a man who would
be willing to collect moderate Customs duties under a
simple tariff for the sake of revenue only, supplementing
them, if necessary, for the maintenance of the revenue, by
duties of excise? Or is he one who would shut up the
Custom-house and endeavour to carry on Government by
confiscating private property in land under the pressure
of a Single-tax? The first of these senses is the one in
which, with a desire to avoid confusion, the term should
be used.
That’s just it. A Freetrader is a man who says
that there should be no Customs duties in
theory, but he collects them “moderately ” in
practice so as “ to avoid confusion.” And the
man who has to act directly contrary to his
own principles so as to avoid confusion must
have a very confused set of principles anyhow.
Last week, in Pentridge Prison, four men and
one boy were tied up and skinned alive by the
Government man-flayer. One man was a grand-
fatherly victim ; the boy was 16 years of age.
It is argued that the lash acts as a deterrent to
the commission of violent crimes, and that the
lash, and the lash only, put down a London
garotting epidemic. P. A. Taylor has fully
proved by official statistics that the volume,
and even the ratio, of violent crimes has by no
means decreased in England since the adoption
of the lash ; brutality is specially inherent in
the Anglo-Saxon, as witness British mainten-
ance of judicial torture. The cat finds many
Australian, and pre-eminently many Victorian,
supporters merely because it has English sanc-
tion. England stands alone among civilised
people in punitive barbarity. She has as her
comrades-in-brutality only Russia, China,
Turkey, Persia, the Red- Indians, and other
barbaric or semi-barbaric peoples. She is
welcome to her pride in her allies. No French-
man, no German, no Italian, no Scandinavian,
no Swiss, Dutchman, Austrian, American—
save the wife-beater of the little State of
Delaware —may be legally flogged m his own
country. The lash is distinctly a Tory torture,
invented for, and only applied to, the man in
the garb of the workman. No one ever saw a
man in broadcloth and moving in society sen-
tenced to be flogged, no matter how brutal may
have been his offence. On this point, so far as
Australia goes, The Bulletin invites contra-
diction. The cat is a special reservation for
the torture of the “ lower orders.” That alone
should ensure its abolition by a democracy.

The London papers report another evidence of
the blessedness of “freedom of contract.” A
great printing firm—the Rose Court Printing
Co. —is the cause of the trouble, and after
years of incessant slave-driving it has acciden-
tally been found out. On the particular occasion
to which attention is drawn 31 girls commenced
work at eight o’clock on Thursday morning
and worked till a quarter to five on Friday
afternoon. They had one or two short breaks
for meals, and were allowed to lie down and
snatch one or two hours’ sleep on the-floor, but
for 33 hours they never quitted the factory.
Then, after eight hours’rest, they resumed work
at midnight and toiled continuously for 13 hours
more, till one o’clock on Saturday afternoon.
The wages for this sort of labour were Bs. a
week, without any extra allowance for overtime.
No compulsion, as the company carefully points
out, was ever put upon the girls : they
had absolute freedom to refuse to work beyond
the regulation hours. All the same, not one of
them did refuse; the dismal privilege of earn-
ing Bs. a week was too precious to bo hazarded
by any sign of unwillingness. Not one of them
complained to the Inspector of Factories ; the
law was ready to protect them whenever
appealed to, but if anyone did appeal then her
Bs. a week would promptly vanish into the
air, and, moreover, she would be black-listed
by all other factory-owners as a dangerous and
cantankerous person who raised industrial dis-
turbances. The girls didn’t even want the law to
come to their assistance of its own accord, for if
it did someone must necessarily be summoned as
a witness, and the fact of giving evidence, no
matter how unwillingly, would almost certainly
prove fatal to the billet and the miserable lit tle
salary. They were all absolutely willing, irt
fact, to work 33 hours at a stretch—they would
doubtless have been willing to work 48 hours if
necessary. This is “ freedom of contract ” when
it gets down to the bed-rock. There is no com-
pulsion whatever; everybody is at absolute
liberty—to starve. The situation is just the
same as that of the free citizen at the bottom of
an ice-well in an uninhabited land. He is free
to stay in, and he is also free to come out; in
every respect he is absolutely untrammelled.
But the sides of the ice-well are very steep and
inaccessible, and he generally stays in. He is
also free to feel warm and comfortable, but he
usually freezes all the same.
During the recent examination of a Sydney
insolvent, the examinee admitted having taken
certain furniture to be upholstered to the extent
of over £2O worth of work and material, after
which he assumed the line of defence that
the furniture was the property of his wife.
There had been a bill-of-sale over it, and,
after the upholstering, a fresh advance of £3O
was obtained on it, and a new bill given in lieu
of the old one. The exasperated upholsterer
inveighed bitterly to the Court against the
rascality of a man who declared that he gave
the order on his own behalf, while swearing
that the furniture was his wife’s property. The
upholsterer seems to have legally “accepted
payment ” by taking the man’s bill. The broad,
just rule should be that, where a wife’s separate
estate or property benefits or is improved by
work done, or material supplied, the wife should
be held personally responsible for the debt so
incurred, as it is to be assumed, in every case,
that she is cognisant of what happens to the
belongings in her custody. Years ago, in
Richmond (Melb.), the present writer saw a
wife successfully sued for the value of a quantity
of paint, purchased by her husband in his own
name, but applied to premises of which she
claimed to be the owner.
When Premier Griffith landed the other day
instate at Rockhampton (Q.) a crowd of his
own particular admirers met him on the wharf
and cheered. There was only one discordant
note in the symphony, and that was supplied by
a certain John Willis, who didn’t feel like
cheering and groaned instead. He was
promptly arrested, and when he appeared at
the Court next day the police conducted the
prosecution with much vigour, and demanded
that he should be committed for trial. As it
chanced, however, the magistrate failed to see
that Griffith should be exempt from public
criticism, and after a long and dreary mass of
evidence had been waded through, the prisoner
was discharged. What The Bulletin is now
waiting to hear about is the arrest of the
balance of the crowd —the ones who applauded.
If the case rested on the question of “ dis-
orderly conduct,” then cheering is quite as
disorderly as groaning, and makes at least 18
times more row, and therefore people cheering in
the public streets ought to be remorselessly
prosecuted. If it didn’t rest on the matter of
“ disorderly conduct,” then what did it rest on?
The one party, presumably, cheered because it
liked Griffith ; the other, apparently, groaned
because it didn’t like Griffith, and as there is
no law, even in Queensland, requiring that
everybody shall like Griffith, logic demands
that, if any arrests were made, the whole crowd
should be run in together. If the grovelling
police official who seized upon this solitary dis-
sentient wished to lay down the law that only
one side of the case should be heard, and that
the other side should lie low under pain of
arrest, then he ought to run in the whole of
the Queensland Opposition, for it also doesn’t
appreciate Premier Samuel, and the language
it aims at him is stronger than all the groans
in the province. It is no good to talk about
freedom of speech if the nation is only free to
say what Griffith wants and nothing else. If
the Queensland Cabinet has any shred of intelli-
gence left in its composition it ■will promptly
sack the Rockhampton boss-Bumble from the
force as a man who is unfit to hold office, and
hardly fit to be at large, in a civilised country.
The policeman who goes about arresting people
for not liking Samuel Griffith is altogether
too vast an autocrat for Australia.
There is no “ imprisonment for debt ” in New
South Wales ! J. T. Merry lost a law-suit in
Sydney, some months ago, and was ordered to
pay over £387. He didn’t. On 22nd Dec.
last, a fresh order was made that Merry should
pay the amount into Court within three weeks.
Again he didn’t. Last week Merry, “attached,”
appeared before Judge Owen in custody. He
promised to discharge the debt as soon as he
could, saying that he was now in a position to
go into business at Eden. His Honor quietly sent
Merry to the debtors’ prison, saying that he had
no course open except to commit him to Dar-
linghurst until that unfortunate “purged his
contempt by payment of the amount,” and that
defendant’s only chance of Eden was to arrange
with plaintiff. Merry, therefore, is not im-
prisoned for “debt”—thank Humbug!—but
only for “ contempt of court,” and is placed
beyond the means of earning money so that he
may the more speedily pay money. There is
no imprisonment for debt in New South Wales.
But Merry’s body is in gaol, and a creditor,
whose slave and captive he now is, holds the
key of his cell.
♦ 7
There is a moral aspect about the New South
Whiles Government Labour Bureau which is
instructive. The institution is haunted by the
detectives of Sydney, who are always on the
lookout for discharged prisoners, and when
they find that one of this objectionable class
has registered himself as an applicant for
honest employment he is promptly reported,
and a black mark is put opposite his name.
The Bureau objects to providing work for dis-
charged prisoners ; so, for that matter, does
every other institution ; and if by any chance
the ex-offender should find employment, despite
this handicap, some hulking police official
promptly “reports ” him to his employer, and
(such is human nature) obtains his discharge.
An Australian detective spends half his time
going round on the trail of discharged prisoners
to prevent them reforming, and when he has
successfully blocked thcex-confinee from getting
any job, however humble, he arrests him for
not having a job; ami the magistrate admonishes
the prisoner in the dock, and tells him that ha
ought to work, and gives him three months
gaol, and when he comes out again the same
process is repeated with only one variation —
that the prisoner gets six months on the second
occasion instead of three. When an offender
has served his sentence the police have abso-
lutely no more right to interfere with
him than they have to interfere with a
bank-manager or a Premier, but until
a dozen detectives are sent to penal servitude
for conspiring to prevent a free citizen obtain-
ing honest employment the force will go on in
its old, brutal, unreasoning fashion. It never
interferes with the rich swindler who has served
his sentence and settled down to enjoy the pro-
ceeds of his fraud ; with the natural instincts
of its mean little soul it reserves all its atten-
tion for the small, penniless offender. So far as
concerns the Labour Bureau, at all events, the
Dibbs Government ought to suppress this un-
lawful system of tyranny and blackmail on the
instant. That institution was created at the
cost of the nation to furnish an equal chance of
employment for any man who is willing to
work. When it is used as an engine to prevent
the reformation of the discharged criminal, then
it becomes an outrage upon morality and an
indelible disgrace to everybody concerned.

Dear Bulletin,— Apropos your remarks
with regard to the travellers recently imprisoned
for asking for food, let me recall an incident
of my own bluey-humping experience. One
day while tramping in the Tarcutta district,
in company with an old Bendigo celebrity known
as Jim Reddan, we got on the wrong track and
were all day without food. Towards evening we
came upon a tilted cart with a fire alongside.
Seated by the fire was an overgrown German,
reading a newspaper, and, most welcome sight of
all, was a huge damper lying on a stump close
by. We both had money—so I immediately
asked Fatherland if he would sell us some tucker.
“ Don’t haf got no ducker,” he replied sullenly.
“ No tucker,” said I, eyeing the damper wistfully;
“well, then, sell me some bread.” “Don't haf
got no pread,” he again answered, more sullenly
than before. I was in despair, we were famish-
ing, but my mate Jim came to the rescue in
a most decisive manner. “ You say you have no
bread ?” queried Jim, looking straight at the sulky
German. “No! no pread,” growled the other,
with persistent mendacity, “nod a bid for my
own subber.” ♦“ Not a bit for your own supper !”
echoed Jim ; “ poor devil! well, I’ll be blanked if
I’ll see any man without bread for his supper,”
and he strode up to the stump, seized the damper,
ran his sheath-knife across the middle of it, and
graciously presented the dumbfoundered Teuton
with half his own damper, coolly observing as he
did so, “ I don’t like to see any blanky man stuck.
Here, old man, here’s some bread for your supper;”
then, with a “Come along, mate,” he tucked the
other half under his arm and walked off, leaving
the German speechless with amazement. It is no
sin to steal food. —Yours, G.B.
The Bega (N.S.W.) Gazette ;
The Bulletin’s weak point comes to the front when our
cynical friend essays dealing with statistics. In a par
last week The Bulletin’s scissors snipped on some facts
about savings banks, and it lets its printer put in type
how England was bursting up because her savings banks
deposits were only £67,000,000 from 4,000,000 depositors,
whilst 6,500,000 French depositors had £112,000,000 stored
up. But we are not told how in France the military and
naval expenditure for 1887 was 39} millions ; for Britain,
25} ; or how from 1882 to 1889 France wasted on her
army and navy (more than the huge empire of Russia)
230 J millions, Great Britain £1634. Or how the French
revenue taxed from the people was, in 1887, 129 J millions
against Britain’s £93}; whilst the indirect taxation in
France for that year was £ss} millions, in Britain
£44}. Or that France had to pay on her public debt
interest amounting to £39l} millions, or 20s. 6d.
per head of her population, Britain £22} millions, or 12s.
7d. per head. And we are told nothing of British Banks,
with a paid-up capital of £70,000,000 for the Joint Stock
Banks alone, and holding deposits worth £6OO millions.
The Bulletin is obliged to the Bega man for
emphasising its case. France has established
Protection, abolished monarchy, and wiped out
the entire race of big landlords ; and, as a result,
althouf/h her people have to pay every year
£14,000,000 more for military and naval purposes,
and £17,000,000 more for interest on the public
debt than those of Britain, and though they lost
at least £500,000,000 from first to last in the war
of 1870-71, and despite the fact that the best of
the nation’s manhood is away on military service,
still the savings banks —the banks of the poor—
have 2} million more depositors and £45,000,000
more deposits than those of England ! If France
were an island like England, then it could dis-
pense with its huge fortresses and its army of
3,000,000 men, and save the £31,000,000 per
annum that Providence has saved to England, and
then it would bo further ahead even than
it is. The £600,000,000 deposits in the
English Joint-Stock banks are nothing to
the point. These are the deposits of
huge capitalists like the Duke of Westminster
and his kind, and have as little to do with the
case as a starving peasant evicted in the snow has
with a marble cathedral. The matter in question
is that Republicanism, Protection, and the aboli-
tion of large estates have ameliorated poverty in
France, and that the working-classes, despite the
conscription and the tremendous load of debt, are
vastly better off than they arc in the “ free ” and
miserable land of England.

BJ6 Macquarie-strcet North, Sydney, March 16, 1892.
My Dear Moorabinua, —
A recent Sydney divotce-case re-pointed the moral that
women do not (as the Suffragists insist) get all the kicks
and none of the ha’pence which are scooped in by
almighty' Man, but are treated with greater consideration
in many ways. As an instance: in the race for tire
parsley-wreath mentioned in the van of these stirring
truths, a medical question came up, and a fusillade of
impertinent personal queries was fired at the petitioning
husband by the counsel for the defence until the Judge
even was moved to pity. Now it seems that when a
woman is made a target of in the witness-box and the
opposing barrister wants to—er— itemize her doctor’s
bills, it is the rule to put the questions privately in
writing, and if that isn’t a concession worth being a
woman to get I would like to know what is? Poor
Married Man has to loudly describe, if needs be, the
longtitude and latitude of every mustard-plaster he has
been flayed with, in answer to the hoarse questions of a
wigged tormentor in open court. Woman is per-
mitted to softly state what she took for the earache
(or as the case might be) in faint and blushing pencil.
It isn’t a joyous thing to be a man quite all the time,
is it ?
Apropos of divorce—a Sydney woman of a charitable
disposition had a brush with a divorcee quite recently.
She (the divorcee) had limed another matrimonial bird
"ho tried to get her whitewashed by imploring his lady
friends to call upon the wronged darling who was quietly-
living it all down poor dear. One went. On the visit the
darling behaved quite up to the part, but when she paid
her return visit, she made her way to the good Samaritan’s
drawingroom with a hat on three hairs, and a pug-dog
under each elbow.
By the way, I see that a large number of the Suffragistg
want the N.S.W. Government to appoint female gaolers
for the benefit of women in country prisons. Can it be
that the lady-agitators pant for billets under the regis of
that fetching bachelor, Comptroller-General Miller?
Some of them - the moustachioed ones—would certainly
make mest able-bodied penal officials.
In choosing a husband (that brilliant manner of launch-
ing a pearl of wisdom reminds me of the first plunge of a
cook-book recipe) the sensible young woman who is lucky-
enough to have the chance will do well not to throw her
handkerchief at the “jolly” man whose kiss is a loud-
resounding smack (though, mind you, I haven’t the
faintest idea'of how she’s going to find that out) and who
leads the convivial " He a jolly good f ler ! ” chorus round
a ball suppor table, because he is invariably the interest-
ing gentleman who figures in the nisi prim division
charged with splitting the door panels with bis gristly
fist and pursuing his wife with a shot-gun under the
glimmering starlight six months after the wedding.
It’s nearly always the “ fine, jovial, rattling good
fellow ” who is a perfect brute by his own ingle, and don’t
let Virginia forget it. It is generally safe to bet that the
Benedict whom the barmaid hastens to serve has just
left a wife who is turning the trimming on her last
Autumn’s bonnet, or is patching Johnny’s trousers with
pa’s worn-out dress-coat, and while her legal supporter is
calling for letter champagne down tow n, she moistens
the parched side of her soul at the pump. Oh, maidens
wistful for matrimony (I’m repeating Just what all the
married women tell me)tfo keep your “ weather eye ” on
the “popular ” male defendant in a dozen divorce-suits
and thereby learn to deprecate the rollicking suitor who
wears his hat a little to loo’ard and is worshipped and
quoted by a string of male devotees ! You may not, of
course, deserve a better husband than this expansive soul
will make, but that is no reason why I shouldn’t raise a
hollow, moaning voice and warn you unto seventy timts
seven against him.
I am not as a rule interested in murder cases, but the
story of how the Windsor assassin—almost directly after
murdering his wife—went to a Melbourne matrimonial
agency in the character of a would -be bridegroom
compels one’s horrified interest. How careful women
should be when entering into matrimonial engagements
with men of whom they know absolutely nothing—men
who, for ought they know, may be (as in the present case)
giving them as a pledge of affection the opal brooch
taken from the throat of some woman bricked-up beneath
a hearthstone. I suppose such trust and faith in her
alleged lover as has been displayed by the young lady
from Bathurst are Beautiful and Womanly Attributes,
but they are liable to make her relatives bald with worry,
if she doesn’t trade some of them away for a little horse-
sense. She—in the universal meaning of the word—
never will, though. Women with what is called the
connubial temperament would—like Goethe’s Martha—
swear everlasting devotibn to Satan if he sued to them
in tan boots and a coat that didn’t wrinkle at the
shoulders
At the recent annual brain-worry at Sydney University
the lady students who hustled for honours had to tians-
late a bit of nineteenth-century English back into its
original Anglo-Saxon—" Right so the good Knight bight
Sir Sagramore wit him well,” and that sort of archaic
delirium ; but what every-day use is that to anybody I
should like to know? If the Pundits worry these haplrss
disciples of Minerva In such a sixth-century manner they
should take a line right through the professions and make
the embryotic architect draw diagrams of an early
British dog-hole, or give a ground plan of Stonehenge ;
and the budding artiste should be required to daub him-
self with wood os an indlspensible preliminary! Apropos
Sydney’s Alma Mater, the local girl-grads, affect a very
picturesque appearance as they stroll about in the level
lawns batlcss, in flowing college gowns with palm-leaf
fans and scarlet parasols (Sydney is a place which wants
more brass band music and red umbrellas), but they mostly
talk a strange patter like the language in which the
average school-boy clothes his rush of ideas. Said such a
she under-grad, in my hearing lately as she talked-they
always are talking, by the way—of (he exam. : “So, you
see, I got up chemistry for a spell, just to make a devil of
a row, you know.”
When the matric. exam, is under way (doesn’t it seem
cruel to time it for hot and muggy March, when every-
body is at mental ebb-tide?), a posse of she-dragons are
hired to keep an eagle eye on the girl candidates, to see
that they don’t produce pirated answers out of their
coiffures, or set down book-worked mathematics, carefully
pencilled beforehand on their shirt-cuffs. The dragons
are supposed to be here, there and everywhere, and hand'
glasses of water to fainting students, who are not allowed
free access to the filter, lest they should stuff some con-
traband tips up the tap for a chum “in the know” to
profit by, and the literary duenna of the ’Varsity who
does her duty must be very brisk about it. But one
dragon at the recent seance did most of her “beat”
sitting down, and only kept her sleepless eye on the
victims within range, so any girl in the back, who had
risked it to stuff her hollow tooth with useful data, had
lovely opportunities. By the way, I hear that prigging
was largely indulged in by the girls’ division, and that
when a subject rises and floors a student individually, she
simply keeps her side-eye on the nearest girl who is
wrestling with it.
Which all reminds me that the whole governing body,
male and female, of the Sydney Women’s College means to
rise and give Miss Jessie Macdonald the brand-new lady-
principal of the Women’s part a reception in the great
ball-room, soon after her arrival. No date has been given
so far. N.B.—No matter how 7 “intellectual” and ad-
vanced the lady it seems always necessary 7 for her to be
brought to her bearings with tea and cake.
Cuttica dressed Traviata very well, but she looked her
best in the cream robe-de-chambre of the death-scene,
where she ought to (between ourselves) manage her
skirts a good deal better. Signora Tresani wore an
artistic dress, cut low enough to reveal a dimpled pair of
shoulders, in the Empire style—black lace en trainci
bordered with crushed pink roses, and looped on the left
over pink silk; but Sisco in a towzled wig, as if he had
pelted through a rose-bush, might have sat for a photo,
of the bogey man.
In re a certain very high-toned philanthropic society 7,
which refuses to assist beggarly old invalid ladies,
yet is more than considerate to attractive young ones,
may I he permitted to enquire whether lady Samaritans
are so scarce that it is necessary to thrust a man into
the privacy 7 of female indigence, in order to discover the
hona-fidcs of applicants?
The revival of “The Arabian Nights” at Sydney
Criterion served to show off two pretty 7 toilets at any
rate, I mean Marie Fraser’s electric-blue silk, long-
tailed tea-gown with dove front of soft white-striped stuff
bound across Bernhardtishly with silver lace ; and child-
voiced Ida Liston’s accordeon-pleated canary-silk skirt
and bodice with corselet of brown velvet and wondrous
sleeves-flat hot trimmed with yellow roses and brown
velvet vulgarising the pretty frock down to the expected
sartorial level of the India-rubber girl—for nobody short
of a variety artist off the chain would make street wear of
so festive a garment. But what I want to ask is—“Do
music-hall darlings always sit on the table swinging then-
feet and smoking cigarettes to the long wash of brandy-
and-soda ? Is there really no other phase of the song-and-
dance lady in her unguarded moments?” In the first
production of the comedy under discussion Maggie Knight
sat on the table and smoked, and Ida Liston casually
comes along four years afterwards and sits on the table
and smokes, and you begin to have a dazed suspicion that
the red-hot toot of the average Tottie must become dis-
mally monotonous in the fourth decade. Or is it that
your skirted Thcspienne doing music-hall business in a
drawing-room comedy clings to the wayworn stage direc-
tions because she is so many miles above evolving new
and hilarious business out cf her ow n innerconsciousness?
Her narrow notion of wliat constitutes untrammelled
behaviour is on all-fours with the laborious way in which
she makes believe to get through a stage-direction
cigarette, which, in private, she would probably devour
in two gasps. By the way, it looks most unnatural to see
an actress shying at cigarettes-as a rule they have a
genuine mania for paper puffs. (I suppose the wicked
editor will delete my italics.)
One tiling is positive-patrons of Sydney Koyal are cer-
tainly cooler at Bland Holt’s plays than they were at the
opera, for, no matter how full the house, those melodious
exiles wouldn’t have the root opened one inch, lest “ye
damp air of Sydenia ” would foggify their treble registers,
and wasn’t it hot in consequence! There is period
staging and dressing all through a “Sailor’s Knot”
(action in the reign of George IV.); the bygone garbings
of the Regency were correctly done and made up intogay
and novel stage pictures from post to finish. Mrs. Bland
Holt (she got a hearty welcome and complimentary
flowers, by the way) looked well in her high-waisted blue
gown with white muslin apron and fichu, and Regency
bonnet (they are going to be fashionable again, the
milliners tell me) in white straw and blue ribbons and
feathers worn in the first act; but the quaint yellow silk
gown with soft white muslin kerchief and poke bonnet in
yellow straw and ribbons, which she wore in the wedding
scene, was simply scrumptious in effect. Kate Bishop was
cordially supported by her wardrobe also, and sported a
pale-pink silk, a white silk with fichu of orange-blossoms
and curtained bonnet en suite, and a white brocade with
flashing diamonds, which best became her. By the way,
her gowns were snipped with rather an exceeding snip in
front—but I suppose that was only severe chronological
correctness, for don’t you always feel a mad longing to
interpolate a deep lace tucker into the oil-painting of
your grandmother?
Mrs. Bernard-Bcerc, who arrived at Melbourne the
other day, and was “received” on board the specially-
chartered pleasure-steamer Ozone as she stepped from the
R.M.S. Orient, is described for me by an esteemed corres-
pondent ns “ a cross between Mrs. Brown-Potter and the
Bernhardt, but without the beauty of Kyrlo Bellew's
admirer or the sprightliness of the divine Sara.” Mrs.
Beercwore opal-tinted shot silk perfectly plain as to the
skirt and a handsome seal mantle w ith sable cuffs and
collar, a black feather boa and a ravishing little black hat
w ith a knot of seagreen velvet, and a spotter! veil. The long
lady, who has rather small, scintillating grey eyes and a
rather small nose, owns a generous but pleasant mouth,
smiles frequently, and shows a splendid set of teeth. She
was very pale and was suffering from the effects of
influenza. In his speech of welcome the ever-beautiful
and juvenile J. ,T. Butters went back into the genesis
of Australian threatrical history, beginning with
Brooke and ending with Bcrnard-Beere, and assur-
ing that lady that all the stars who came to Australia
were B.'s to a man and woman. Then someone solemnly
said, as a compliment, that the fame of M. Marius hid
preceded him, and everyone winked at his neighbour.
Mrs. Bernard-Be ere, in a rich thrilling voice thanked
everyone for their good wishes, and said she hoped to be
able to act up to her initials. St. John Marius is a dapper
little man with an nggressively-elippui moustache and a
remarkably long chin. A dudish-looking youth carried
round a box which everyone supposed to contain 8.-B.’s
jewels. Herbert Standing is a jolly-looking man, and
wore a straw hat with a red band. Not one of the
tctors wore check suits; they were all in black coats.
Eccles Anson presented everyone to Mrs. 8.-8., and
Charles Ryley, who brought his patent double-action sneer
with him, supported Eccles, who looked glad when the
business was over. One of the ladies of the company (an
American) wore a rough tweed tailor-gown that was per-
fectly cut and fitted to perfection, and although the lady
had no collar nor brooch and only a small felt hat with a
brown veil, she fairly took the cake for good style. It
was a splendid idea to take Mrs. Bernard-Beere across to
St. Kilda and drive her to the Esplanade Hotel, where she
will occupy the suite used by Bernhardt. Think of the
difference to a stranger who first sees Melbourne via Port
Melbourne and its vile backyards ! P.M. is seemingly
composed of back-yards where it is always washing-day.
Just at present people who dine in restaurants should
shun tempting dishes served with mushroom trimmings,
because those damp and dangerous weeds are coming in
mingled with the suicidal toadstool, and the mushroom"
gatherers who supply the city market root up the just
and the unjust in ecpial quantities, while the undertaker
smiles joyously on their unprejudiced industry. Only
the other day in a Sydney cafe a young man ate some
steak and alleged mushrooms for lunch. Tw’enty minutes
after he was flat on his back in a drug-shop with an
excited chemist pouring draughts into him by the jugful,
while an assistant went for a doctor and the police.
Heroic remedies at last prevailed, and that young man

his life, for few people get poisoned twice accidentally.
I have received two “Australian National” songs—
“ Federation ; or the Future Republic,” dedicated to Mr.
“Toby” Barton by the composers, S. Mackay and Edgar
Winson, and “The Flag of the South,” music by L. J.
Bogle, and words by E. J. Brady. The first-named is a
sort of catalogue in G major, setting forth just what
furniture Australia wants to set up as a Free State with,
and scrupulously set to a tune which would be the very
thing for —a children’s evening hymn. The second
warble—well, I do detest over-earnestness, which means
bathos. How feeble are all the modern “cant” denun-
ciations of tyrants, and so on, when you know that
they have been translated into ineffectual English from
the French of the Revolutionary time 1 My opinion of
the Australian is that he won’t sing patriotic songs—save
with his tongue in his cheek. He will not destroy tyrants
with froth, and what I have heard called “ blather.” He
will approach them and lay them low in a spirit, not of
guileless enthusiasm, but of cold-blooded, calculating
cynicism.
The spectacle that riveted one’s gaze in the trial trip of
Seville’s Barber, at the Royal, the other evening, was
Sisco’s shanks, and if their beautiful curves were only
cotton-wadding I certainly advise spider-finished members
of the ballet to go on their knees to him for the recipe.
The women, by the way, are all in love with Sisco’s hands,
small and fine, with finger-tips taper as a terrier’s tail
before the dog-fancier’s teeth meet through it—but me-
thinks the blunt-fingered and ham-shaped masculine paw
has more lasting attractions for my gushful sex when its
head is cool —it really doesn’t do for a lover to clasp his
darling’s fists with a shapely hand a size daintier than
your own, you know. Mrs. Cuttica was the Rosina, and
sported a fancy frock of white brocade, short skirt and
bodice with Vandyke of black ; Figaro bodice in maroon
velvet with long sleeves, and trimmed with gold bullion
fringe, crimson roses in her hair and crimson fan—a turn-
out so chipper in effect that, I will venture to bet, a re-re-
re-duplicated Rosina will stalk at lots of costume balls
next season. But isn't it interesting to note how the
tenor never will appear en deshabille ? Signor C., when
disguised as the substitute for a seedy professor of music,
wore his hat three sizes less exaggerated than Travaglini s,
and his spruce black gaberdine was relieved with a point-
lace cravat—while Signor C. T. got up a good comedy
effect in rusty robes and a hat resembling an infant’s
coffin. Tenori, as a matter of useful fact, always like to
be taken seriously and sentimentally, and they resent
whimsical make-up almost as deeply as the painted
soprano of a comic opera Co. loathes and disparages the
convulsing by-play of the funny-man when she is warbling
in a high-class manner “ down centre.”
The circle was a gay spectacle, and many “ thoughtful”
costumes were there to do the Barber reverence. Mrs.
S. A. Moss, in heliotrope-silk net, relieved with spring
green-diamonds, twinkling here and there, had filled her
box with friends. Carrie Swain, in black tulle and silk
and diamonds. A snappy dress was of amber bengaline,
with high Zouave collar embroidered in gold beads and
tinsel, but a Figaro jacket, in red velveteen and silver
fringe (the whole thing rather the worse for wear), had
evidently been hooked out of the depths of some ward-
robe, and donned in compliment to Sisco. Speaking
about opera audiences, isn’t it odd that Lady J., who is
supposed to surge in the van of intellect and culchaw,
never once went to the Maccaroni show at the Royal?
Not, mind you, that the troupe felt a sinking sen-
sation because she didn’t accord her socially mag-
netic patronage—for the season was a great success—
but allee same, it is usual for the vice regal people to lend
rapt countenances to all high-class exhibitions that have
an educative tendency, even if the said vice regal party
are cruelly bored at the whole thing, and are hungering
and thirsting for a curtained box and something with
tights in it.
A largely feminine crowd mobbed the cosy Garrick for
the second performance of “ La Traviata”(or “Camille ”
set to music) last Monday. There was a lot of sombre
black on view. Carrie Swain had lit hers up with
diamonds; Madame Charbonnet-Kellcrmann, in dark
amethyst velvet trimmed with pansies; a Maud Millet
fichu of white chiffon fastened with a diamond brooch
made its wearer (in a d.c. box) look like the sort of girl
who gets lithographed on the back of a sentimental
waltz ; and the old man’s (legal) darling who attracts all
the attention just now had some very rare fur on her
opera-cloak, and silken robes, of course. Among the
audience, by the way, none of the women, no matter how
primrose-hued their cheeks and grizzled their love locks,
would confess to having scon “Traviata” in Sydney
before. “It was twenty years ago, my dear ! I was too
young to be taken to the theatre, of comsc.”
Talking about teeth, a fond Sydney parent was question-
ing his little daughter on what she had learnt that day at
school. “ ’Bout teeth,” chirped the cherub. Then Pa.
waded in to show his grasp of the subject: “Well; what
arc the first teeth!” “Incisors and molars,” answered
she. “And what are the last?” “ False teeth.”
On the 11th. instant, Mr. Denis Clancy the well-known
baritone with a tenor quality concealed about his head
notes (he is about to leave for Europe to put a gable on
his musical-attainments, as it were) had a farewell benefit
concert tendered to him by several of his musical friends.
Mr. Clancy’s voaal chord wants a little more oiling, but
his lilt is sonorous, and most p,’easing, and the Consort a-
toire will doubtless turn him out. as fit ns a new barrel-
organ. But he must promise us one thing-he must not
come hack to Sydney as unless he mean-
while lose his inaiked Italian accent.

The last week of Grand Lallan Opera at
Sydney Royal was a busy one. “Faust,” “Un
Ballo in Masohera,” and “II Trovatore” were
successively presented, and the most delightful
effort, of Rossini’s genius, “II Barbiere di
Siviglia ” was produced with genuine and well-
nigh absolutely triumphant success. The Alma-
viva of the recent operatic essay was Signor
Cuttica, who laboured - energetically and con-
scientiously against vocal disadvantages which
proved almost too much of a handicap for his
undoubtedly clever acting, and which nearly
stranded him once or twice upon the musical shale
and shingle created by the composer for the tenor
role. The well-mannered and sumptuously-attiied
Figaro was a thing of beauty and baritone melli-
fluousness in the hands of Signor Sisco, and the
vocal profundity of Signor Travaglini surrendered
glimpses of its unfathomable gloom in the per-
sonality of bis grimly humorous conception of the
character of Don Basilic. The opera, however, is
really the propeity of Don Bartolo and his clever,
saucy, and interesting ward, Rosina. As the
love-sick and jealous old beau, Signor lorio was
simply delightful. He revelled and rioted in the
humour of the part, and kept the house in a gentle
simmer of amusement with quaint interpolations
of broken English. Signora Cuttica was the
Rosina of the production, and her delicate and
artistic singing, and her piquant acting will com-
bine to render her characterisation of this part a
melodious memory when Italy shall be annexed by
Malta, and opera shall be no more. During the
singing lesson in the third act she sang on separate
occasions two valses, “Vieni” and “Danziamo
Voliamo,” composed by Signor Maffezzoli, the
conductor, who, we are told, has already b Q d an
opera, “Raffaelo,” produced at Milan.

At Sydney Royal, on Saturday night last,
the decks were cleared for action, and the British
tars of an olden period boarded the vocal groves
erstwhile sacred to the 'iuscan warbler. The
house was packed from floor to ceiling.
“A Sailor’s Knot” proved itself a huge melo-
dramatic success, and ought to have a consider-
able grip of popular favour before it is untied.
The plot is involved and complicated with distinct
obligations to Douglas Jerrold and “ Black-eyed
Susan,” and the dialogue is indebted in several
places to Josh Billings and other humourists. The
scene of action wanders from Wapping Old Staiis
to Greenwich Hospital, from Greenwich Hospital
to Stepney Old Church, from this ecclesiastical
antiquity to an old-time three-decker, from the
ship to a French chateau, and finally finds a rest-
ing-place at military head-quarters, on the road to
Paris, subsequent to the Battle of Waterloo. The
period is the year 1814, or thereabouts, and tlie
air is filled with Dibdin’s music, and pig-tai!s
float upon the ocean breeze. Two brothers of
more than human virtue, in love with a French
lady who has a fatal inclination to marriage with
whomsoever she happens to meet last, annex
all the spare sympathy of the audience, and two
villains of unspeakable depravity occupy their
business hours and their leisure moments with
throwing obstacles in the path of virtue, and are
rewarded witli the genuine disapprobation of the
gallery. Mr. Charles Glenny undertakes one of
the virtuous brothers and Mr. Walter Howe the
other. The former is the strong man of the show
and a genuine actor of considerable tragic power.
Miss Kate Bishop supports the weakness of
character assigned to the French lady with
the easy propensity to matrimonial contracts,
and does it surprisingly well. Mr. W. E.
Baker is one of the villains, a polished and
Mephistophelean disciple of Voltaire, with a
refined acquaintance with the paths of crooked-
ness, and Mr. Albert Norman is the Biitish
scoundrel, with a crabbed character and an un-
kempt head of hair. The comedy is supplied by
Mr. Bland Holt—as a jolly young waterman,
with a costume which is a cross between that of a
postman and that of a jockey—and Mrs. Holt, as
his sweetheart, and this lady is as pretty and
piquant a damsel as any man might reasonably
desire to fall in love with. There are several
hundred other characters in this nautical effort of
Mr. Pettitt’s—which is divided into four decks —
and many yards of delectably-painted canvas from
the brushes of Messrs. George and J. Gordon
and H. Grist.
** * *
Sydney Her Majesty’s is at length relieved
from the baleful presence of the Prince of Dark-
ness, and Messrs. Sims and Pettitt’s pomp and
circumstance, entitled “In the Ranks,” is suffer-
ing a brief revival, in order to enable the average
peaceable citizen an opportunity of contemplating
at his well-fed ease the joys of barrack life. This
drama simply wallows in crimson uniforms, and
revels in red-ochre. Geo. Ripnold Henry V.
suffers meritoriously, and everybody is liappy
ever afterwards. As Ned Drayton, we love
him more enthusiastically than as Mephisto. He
is fat, fair, and forty—and all the ladies love
him. Miss Watts Phillips assists the hero through
a catalogue of woe, and shares with him the
delectation of unalloyed bliss represented by
several thousands per annum. Mr. Geo. P, Carey
is the Colonel Wyuter of the revival, and lie dis-
penses cheap morality of the G. R. Sims brand at
reasonable and seductive rates. For the rest,
much is as it used to be, with Mr. Hazlitt as an
unadulterated villain, and Mr. Jewett as a vir-
tuous captain of light infantry. Mr, J. W.
Sweeney’s Corporal O’Leary is likewise a clever
performance, and Mr. Joe Tolano is too good for
this world, and heaven is his home.

At Sydney Criterion, “ The Arabian
Nights” are drawing near a well-earned Cualitv,
ami Geo. W. Anson, as Benjamin Lsn liter, will
gild refined gold and paint tin' lily of artistic
farewell in “ New Men and Old Acres ” on Satur-
day next. The Lilian Brabazon of this produc-
tion will be Mrs. Molyneux, an actress who has
made somewhat of a reputation in England with
the Compton Comedy Company, and Mr.
E 1 ward Hass will play the part of Samuel Brown.
“New Men and Old Acres” will be succeeded
by Robertson’s Comedy of “ Caste," in which Mr.
Geo. W. Anson’s Eo.fles is an achievement of the
highest order of artistic acting. At the conclu-
sion of Ecoles, Mr. Anson packs his trunks ami
glides away to Hmglaml.


A supplementary season of grand Italian
opera opened at Sydney Garrick, on Saturday
last, with Verdi’s tragic and romantic opera of
“ La Traviata,” the libretto of which is founded
on the story of “ La Dame aux Camelias,” by the
younger Dumas. On Monday, again, notwith-
stantfing wet weather, the house was crowded.
Signora Cuttica was the Violetta of the pre-
sent cast ; Signor Cuttica was Alfredo, and
Signor Sisco, Germont, Alfredo’s father. From
a musical point of view the production was a com-
plete and unqualified success, but it was poorly
upholstered, and the characters were eccentrically
attired. Germont appeared as a faded and
rakish-looking cavalier of the court of Charles 1.,
with flowing looks and looped and plumed beaver;
while Alfredo, with a closely-cropped head,
fluctuated between whiles from the 10th to the 18th
century, and Violetta never got away from the
nineteenth —as far as costume was concerned. In
the matter of furniture the management indulged
its eccentricities to the utmost. The dying scene
was only saved from being ridiculous by the
superb singing of Signora Cuttica, for there, in
the middle of the sick room, stood a withered
copy of Charles 1., confronted by an iron bedstead
of the aggressively modern brand, and flanked on
the one hand by a Chinese-made chest of drawers,
and on the other by a Chinese made dressing-
tab’e. For all the world it looked like a dissipated
elderly gentleman returning from a fancy-dress
ball to tin! his wife sitting up for him. Apart
from these irritating incongruities this production
of “Traviata” was highly satisfactory, and
Signora Cuttica in the title rdle excelled all her
previous performances in Sydney, “Lucia,” per-
haps, excepted. It is certainly a long time since
we have heard anything like the singing by this
gifted lady of the final scene of the first act.
Apart from his ridiculous make-up, Signor Sisco
was an admirable Germont, and Signor Cuttica
was better as Alfredo than as anything else he has
played in since Elgardo, in “ Lucia.” On Tuesday
“Lucrezia Borgia” was produced, with Signonna
Guidotti in the name-part of Donizetti’s master-
piece ; and on Friday Flotow’s five-act comedy
opera of “Martha” revived historical recollec-
tions of Queen Anne and the old-time customs of
our great-grandfathers.

The Polytechnic has recently indulged in
marionettes, Wild West wonders, and a gas
explosion, which last contributed a great deal to
the advertisement of this delectable catacomb.
The Coogee and other Aquariums continue in the
marine enjoyment of much floating patronage,
and the Cyclorama still lights the way to a
patriotic death. At the Garrick every Sunday
evening the voice of the warbler is heard in the
land, and Mr. Larmour has arranged to take the
Criterion every week on the same day for the
same purpose.

Dan Barry’s Dramatic Company opened
at Victoria Theatre, Newcastle, N.S.W., on
Monday, in “The Parson’s Oath,” described as a
thrilling, realistic and humorous piece from the pen
of the late Spurgeon, and dealing with the lights
and shades of London life. Dan makes a unique
“clerk in holy orders,” as Rev. John Audley, and
is well supported by a large and efficient
company. sv

“Randolph the Reckless” was let 1005. 6
at Melbourne Royal on Saturday before a crowd
of almost Boxing Night dimensions. Officially
described as an extravaganza, “ Randolph ” is in
most places, a compound of old and new style
burlesque, sufficiently ridiculous to be funny. But
at times the scene is reduced to a cheerless corri-
dor, whither each leading performer wanders in
turn to do nothing in particular, beyond diverting
attention from the clamour of carpenters in the
rear. On these occasions, “ Randolph ” resembles
the stop-gap portions of a pantomime, and ceases
to be reckless. If the dialogue were smarter, the
music more original, the orchestra and chorus
stronger, and a couple of the principal characters
less obtrusive, one might have great hopes of the
present entertainment. As things went on
Saturday, the general effect was rather thin, and
when the audience saw the end approaching,
they cleared out with more haste than is cus-
tomary, even in Australia. However, the success
or failure of a gaudy leg-show of this class
is not necessarily decided by a first-night verdict.
“Randolph” is not trammelled by a plot, and
may be turned into something quite different
without the least prejudice to the author’s idea,
because ho never had an idea to start with.
Brim ton has painted some capital scenery for the
production, and when the big stage isn’t shut out
from view by the aforesaid corridor cloth the
popular demand for splendour is fully complied
with. Billee Barlow, in the name part, is more
Farrenish than usual, and remains on terms of
strong personal friendship with her “house ” all
the time. Her appearance is a host of talent in
itself, in addition to which she sings several songs
in best music-hall style, and woos the heroine
with great gus:o Her excuse for not kneeling to
make love—viz., that it would spoil her tights—is
amply sufficient. They certainly are beyootiful
tights. Rumour alleges that a fairy wove thehs
on Billee when she was a baby, since which time
she has expanded within their silken toils until
they have become incorporated with her very
being. Walton, as the villain of the piece, is
droll and nimble, also Harry Shine acts up to
his name. Edwin Kelly, Lillian Davies, and
Harry Daniels make a good impression, and an
interpolated performance by the Tokio Troupe of
Jap. jugglers gives pleasure to all. But Edith
Vane and Harry Barnes are drawbacks. The
lady is fairly vivacious and happy every now and
then, but as a ballad-singer she requires judicious
curtailment, and will be better appreciated when
she remains silent. Her songs don’t reach the
heart, somehow. They pierce the ear and attack
the liver, but pass the susceptible bnzzum coldly
by. As for Harry Barnes, in short skirts and a
sham nose, he must moderate his transports forth-
with. The programme states that Barnes has
played his character for two years in England,
but this proves nothing except that the British
race is becoming dotty in its old age. Mr, B. is
now in the kawlinies, a stranger in a strange land,
and if he likes to make a point of always blotting
himself out in the first act, his early disappear-
ance will bo thankfully received.

Nothing fresh concerning “La Cigalo ”
happens to suggest itself at the moment. Audran's
comic grand opera entered upon its fifth week at
the Princess’, last Saturday, and seeing that the
house was absolutely crowded once again the
merits of this handsome show need no puff in the
meantime. The new prima-donna evidently repre-
sents a wise stroke of policy.

past glories in the hose and doublet of Kosalind.
The Immortal Bard is to look in once a week

“ Captain Swift” is given a reasonable
chance to show his quality at Melbourne Bijou.
On Saturday night the story of the retired bush-
ranger, who shoots himself to spare his mother’s
feelings and oblige her family, was greeted with
great gusts of applause at the end of every act and
important exit. The breathless silence that
reigned around the most pathetic incidents was
broken only by the splash of falling tears, and
when the house was required to feel a thrill, it
experienced that sensation in all its phases.
Charles Warner used to overact the gallant
Captain throughout. He put too much bright
paint on the character, and gurgled in his agony
like the last quart of water that is escaping from
a bath. Nor was his general support strong
enough for the play. The B. and B. rendering of
Haddon Chambers’ tricky work is, on the whole,
more human and impressive. Titheradgotones the
melodramatic adventurer down without sacrificing
an iota of effect, and manages to make strong
points without calling attention to the manufac-
ture of them. He doesn’t ring a muffin-bell of
by play, so to speak, every time he is going to be
startled, or horror-stricken, but he keeps the public
eye fixed upon his every movement, and that
potential optic takes in the situation without
blinking. The author represents Captain Swift
as a clever impostor, bold and resourceful, who
would certainly have “ taken in ” a quiet family
but for the presence amongst them of a squatter
he had stuck up in days of yore, and of a degraded
menial in black, who fills the position of resident
undertaker to the family and is always taking
mental measurements for everybody’s coffin.
Titheradge realises the conception of the hero,
whereas Warner obtruded his false pretences, and
went out of his way to create suspicion, like the
gentleman who planted his young bride under the
hearthstone. This change of treatment accounts, in
the first place, for the reception given on Saturday
to a play that created little enthusiasm three years
ago. Mrs. Brough, in the part of next impor-
tance, is very good—considering. She is not a
great emotional actress, and, if she were, the
character would still be many years too old for
her. Boucicault may pass with honours, for the
elderly husband, but Mrs. Brough will never
satisfy the world that she is Tith.’s ma. In
fact, no young woman can convincingly add a day
to her age in comedy or drama, although many
elderly charmers can knock off a quarter of a
century without outraging probability. Mrs.
Brough, notwithstanding her youngness in years
and manner, is a pleasant surprise in this arduous
part, but that’s about all. A negative success in-
stead of being a disastrous failure. Her predecessor
was a disastrous failure. Sass is smart and manly
as the squattah, and Lawrence very picturesque
and striking as the resident suggestion of the
family vault. Emma Temple plays the “Cap-
tain’s ” mash prettily, and artists like Cecil Ward,
Pattie Browne, Corlesse, and Emma Gwynne in
minor parts naturally tend to make them seem
bigger. “ Captain Swift ” deserves to capture the
town.

Dampier has seized a great opportunity
by the throat and means to shake it for all it is
worth. On Saturday next (19th.) the stage of
Melbourne Alexandra will be dedicated to “Wilful
Murder,” a new realistic drama of powerful local
interest. The villain intends to bury his victim
up the chimney, or somewhere, and the horrid
deed will be discovered by its overwhelming smell,
according to all accounts. Melbourne is ripe for
this drama, and Dampier can be congratulated
upon a solid business success even before the
corpse has been discovered. The name of the
author of “Wilful Murder” is being kept dark
for the present, but the police have a clue to his
identity, and the truth must soon leak out. The
play was really written by the Divine Wi'liams.

L. L. Smith, Butters and Zox, who seem

When “Our Boys” was first read at London Vaude-
ville, the assemblage included D. James, T. Thorne,
Warner, and Barren, on the look-out for their parts, and
all agreed that the play was “ weak, very weak.” At the
last rehearsal, all agreed again that it would run only a
month, but the run was four years. When Buckstone, at
the llaymarket, produced a play called “Mont Blanc,”
the performers could not rehearse for laughing. Not a
laugh at night, and this piece ruined Bucky.

Johnny Hall used to tell how an opera by Lecoccj was

“Black Prince,” wherein he acted Dr. Maresnest. They
bought up a heap of Lecocq’s early fragments of music,

wrote a bitter letter to the English press.
One of the race of Yankee showmen who visit Australia
to teach the natives how to ride bucking horses, and who
thereupon appear in a circus mounted on an exhausted

(N.S.W.) to six years confinement for discrepancies in the
ownership of a horse. About an hour after the sentence
was passed there was a missing cowboy in Murrurundi
gaol. The long-haired one had fled over the wall.
A dashing Hibernian medico, of Sydney, has fallen a

Wills, the dramatist, had always some ungrateful
pensioner on hand. He picked a broken-down, starving
University man out of the gutter once, and look him
home, and appointed him his secretary. He didn’t want
a secretary, but all the same lie paid the ungrateful and
unlovely old wreck’s salary till the day of his death. The
Secretary was always coughing, snuffling, wheezing and
complaining; he never did any work and he groaned all
day long. One winter night some friends called on Wills
and found him smoking his pipe on the pavement and
gambolling about to keep from freezing. The old wreck
had issued his ukase that tobacco made him feel worse,
and Wills took his pipe outside rather than injure the
venerable one’s feelings by reminding him that he didn’t
own the premises.

At latest dates it was expected that Johnny Toole

D'Oyley Carte’s latest production, “The Vicar of

A Melbourne paper mentions that “Professor Archibald
is delighting large audiences in Calcutta with his phono-
graph.” Archibald, by the way, stands in much the same
relation to the Edison instrument ns does an Italian
organ-grinder to his portable box of music. Either pro-
fessor turns a handle and the sound comes out. In fact,
it is hard to see what particular wisdom and learning the
phonograph attendant makes profession of. The little
apparatus hadn’t been long at Melbourne Waxworks
before Phil Stuart could work it just as well as Archibald,
who always kept up a pretence of being the only man in
the know.
Cyclorama lecturer; “It was there that the Prince
Imperial received his ‘baptism of fire,’ ihe same Prince
Imperial who afterwards fell fighting for England against
the Zulus in New Zealand.” . . . Which reminds us
that when the late (if he is really dead this lime) D. C. F.
Moodie was lecturer to a Zulu War diorama at Adelaide
his voice broke down, and a sympathetic pressman volun-
teered to take up the narrative. The pressman knew
nothing about the Zulu War, anyway, besides which he
was interestingly drunk, but he intrepidly mounted the
cask which formed the rostrum, and began to speak his
spotted thoughts as the diorama unrolled. He introduced
the landing of Captain Cook, the wars of the Maoris, the
invasion of Britain by Julius Caesar, the Indian Mutiny,
and the naval fight at Actium between Octavius and
Antony, interspersed with biblical references to the rout
of the Midianites by wandering Israel, and the fall of
Jericho. The last item finished it.

The Australian Theatrical Management Company is
going into peaceful liquidation. In the present state of
the market there is no hope for the shareholders to
recover the money dropped over Laura Villiers. Coppin
is right. “Things have been done too well here. They
have now reached such a standard that unless you keep
up to it you do no business, and if you do keep up to it
you will lose money. That is exactly the position of
theatrical matters now.” The Bulletin put it in rhyme
a few months back. Wise Garner to clear out.
A circus-manager was hanged at Greenock the other
week, unnoticed by the cable-man—though, perhaps, this
was the criminal over whose doctor-bungled execution

couldn’t satisfactorily answer the question why she had
“treated him like a dog,” by declining to be mashed.
Circuses pride themselves on their high moral tone, by
the way. The ladies are mostly married to members of
the company they travel with, and monogamy is almost a

He never asked anyone for help; he would walk up the

“I Dreamt.” After giving a couple of selections, he
would move on to another spot, without passing round

up while he was whistling and put their contribution into
his hand ; he would put it into his pocket without look-

Wadham Wyndham, who slew his wife
and family and is now confined in Darlinghurst
Prison, is a remarkably well-read man, but has an
inveterate prejudice against Dickens. This is
solely on account of a passacre in the opening
chapter of “David Copperfield,” in which the
debut of the hero on life’s stage is stated to be
“ proticipated ” (as Mrs. Gamp would say) by
Miss Betsy Trotwood appearing at the parlour
window and pressing her nose flat against the
window-pane. Wyndham considers the introduc-
tion of the incident grossly indelicate, and will not
read a page of the great novelist’s other works,
although he admits that he may be hypersensitive.
The unfortunate man is a voracious reader of
fiction notwithstanding, and worries through

Canon Rich. One day he consulted a late arrival
as to anything fresh in ephemeral literature, and
was told of a work by Frank Barrett, entitled
“ Fettered for Life.” His eye glistened, and he said
ho would requisition. It may be mentioned
that as W. is confined during “the Queen's
p'easuro ” he is allowed exceptional indulgences,
he has Ids cell half lined, is allowed to send for
approved books, and woiks only by his own
choice; in addition to which he is permitted
the en oyment of gas till fl p in. Ilis informant
warned him that the book had a yellow covei wit h
the representation of two convicts going to work
at Portland under the supervision of an armed
warder, and that it would be unlikely to “pass.
The vaticination was correct enough.
Scientific Rabbiting.
(FOR THE BULLETIN.)
You know Bacchus Marsh. That was the locality,
and the town was red with rabbiters. My busi-
ness was to collect and book the animals for the
vans that came twice a week. Friday was our
Sunday, because carcases of that day’s manu-
facture would not sell the next day but one.
Therefore, on Friday the men went into the Marsh
“to buy a few things.” But an enterprising
Frenchman called De Boosie brought the things
within nearer range, and with Madame and wine
secured the patronage of six of my best trappers.
It is of a party of three that I am going to tell.
They were all from the South of Scotland some-
where about the Annan, and had probably been
poachers at home, and they made big money, paid
in cash fortnightly. I was camped on a sandhill
half a mile nearer to the road than they were, and
used to ferret and shoot so as to pass the time.
One Friday I was in some bushes close to the
tent, when De Boosie drove up in his spring-cart.
He had apparently no load, but got down and
looked into my tent. I never liked the man, and
loved him less after I saw what he did. Ho had
made sure that I was from home, and nowhere
handy.
As I remarked, I lived among sand. Then he
drew his mare in front of my camp, unloosed the
belly-band and raised the point of the shafts.
First of all, he had unpinned the tail-board.
With a crash of breaking glass, five bags (ap-
parently) were launched on the soft ground. The
tail-board was adjusted, the belly-band buckled,
and the frog-eater was mounting, when I showed
up. There were poor, old Geordy Halliday, Billy
Grearson and Tommy Dumfries, spread out “quite
loose on the strand, and a peaceful-like smile on
their features,” and the sand red with the blood
of bottles.
That Frenchman never brought me another load
of wine and rabbiters. The =£2 fine for aggra-
vated assault was paid by his victims. The police
hunted Freuchy to some other rabbiting camps,
and he died as he lived—a dog with a taint on
his soul. But the scientific part—that consisted
in the skilful manner in which the three Scotch-
men slittered (that’s the word) over the sand,
with one of the unbroken bottles in each hand.
They were too drunk to walk ; Wully went on
hands and knees (the bottles were like snow-shoes
for him); Tarn used the bottles as pegs, planting
the thin ends and then drawing himself up to
them ; but, Georgy, poor old Halliday ! lie rolled
to the shade of a tree.
Where are they now ? Grearson’s buried on a
station; Dumfries is married and unhappy, whilst
the rolling-stone is paralysed in one of the great
asylums of Sydney. Better be like Grearson.

Parliament opens 29th inst.
“Those silken bonds!” John Bull only
thinks of the parchment ones.
Queensland is now patiently waiting for
the MTlgriff manifesto as the natural sequence to
that issued by Griffilwraith.
Garvan, in effect, predicts that should Aus-
tralia separate from England before federating
her own provinces there will be danger of civil
war.
At last Bananaland elections, there were
returned to Parliament, out of a total of 72
members, 60 who distinctly pledged themselves
against coloured labour. Now, rats !

Cooktown Independent suggests that
British Governors in Australia should be abol-

office, should be honorary Governor of his colony.
The evergreen Butters has consented to
withdraw from the Council and let himself be put
through for Wangaratta (Vic.) at next election.
Butters seems satisfied that he has got a “ dead

The policy of the really democratic party
all over Australia is to keep all railways in the
hands of the State. If Minister Lyne, (N.S.W.),
who is wobbling on the subject, pastes this in bis
hat, it will save him a heap of trouble.
-Premier Shiels has given up the Victorian
Legislative Council as hopeless; it won’t provide
one colleague for him —till after the general
elections. Shiels is to disclose his policy, if he
has one, at Casterton, this Saturday.
The peascod Patriotic League is at logger-
hea ls with the Australian Natives’ Association,
in Melbourne. One of the chief Patriotic fugle-
men, now “ barracking ” for Queen Victoria, used
to denounce Royalty before he was shifted one of
the A.N.A.
Labour-member Ryan, who now represents
the Barcoo (Q.), was one of the alleged “riotous
conspirators ” arrested at Barcaldino last year,
and tried at Rockhampton. He was acquitted.
Now, lie represents Barcaldine in the Bananaland
Parliament.
SA. “ National Defence League ” is
working well! Recently the Adelaide Licensing
Bench refused to grant a club license to the
Adelaide Democratic Club, which has been
extremely aggressive (and successful) politically
during the last four years.
According to Reynolds’ Newspaper,
there is still on the British Statute Book a law,
passed in the reign of Henry V., but never acted
upon since the time of Charles IT., prescribing
payment of members, at a rate which would now
be equivalent to 255. a day.
A suggestion is made in England that the
demand for land for small holdings might be met
by permitting land-owners to pay succession-
duties in land, such land to become irrevocably
the property of the State, and to be leased in
perpetuity to persons of the agricultural labour
class.
The worm has turned, 3000 strong. At
“General” Booth’s last great meeting of the
“ submerged tenth ” the audience howled down
their benefactor as a “sweater” and a fraud, and
plainly intimated their belief that he was making
money out of their distresses. The big drum will
revolt next.
It is stated, on the pious authority
Robert Harper, M.L.A., that the one great pur-
pose of the Young Victorian Patriotic League is
“to defend their country, to fight for it, aye, and
to die for it,” in the cause of Property against
democracy. A political association for firing low
and laying ’em out, seemingly.
Premier Playford, in his private letters
from India, says that “ Tamil” (i.c., cheap nigger)
labour would be just suitable for the Northern
Territory. This confirms recent Bulletin warn-
ings. Yet Inspector Parkes, the S.A. Govern-
ment’s own officer, reports that white labour is
most fitted for the N.T.
Lord Masham, who was one of Gobden’s
Freetrade chairmen in ’47, at a recent Empire
Trade League conference to advocate preferential
tariffs between Britain and the colonies :—“ Were
Cobden now alive, ho (C.) would advocate the
present professed principlesof the League.” Which
are nothing if not Protectionist!
The Victorian Minister of Customs meekly
apologises for having issued cheap licenses to
manufacture cigars, whereby the “representative”
weed factories find a portion of their trade diverted
into humble channels. In granting the concession,
says Minister Turner, “he had no intention of
starting small manufacturers to compete with the
large establishments!”
The Argus, speaking on the coming
election, says that on one side (the One-man-one-
yote) are arrayed the criminals, loafers, and float-
ing population of labourers, while on the other
(the Dual-vote side) is the thrifty, industrious,
and honest section of the community. What a
crime it is to be poor ! Workmen of Victoria,
remember the Berry time and accept this the
brutal challenge of your traditional enemy.
If the Saviour re-appeared on earth in
Australia, he would be set down as one of the
“unthrifty” class, and, as a nomad, would have
no vote at all, while Balfour, Meudell, Jerry
Rundle, “ Cokum ” Epps, Murray-Prior, Tommy
Kelly—all good Christians, mind you—would have
at least two apiece ! “ Give all your goods to feed
the poor !” There— be it reverently said—is a
picture for you : the landless pauper, Jesus, before
the Australian bogus-National Association.
G. D. Meudell, stockbroking warrior,
is especially eager for the coming fray in the
Cabbage Garden. At the head of his young
patriot brigade he will be found, so he begs
to announce, on the “ ramparts ” of Capital Castle
“ fighting anarchy.” In the event of no anarchy
coming forward to get fits, the truculent ram-
party will be found guarding his seat at the
Exchange, and selling silver shares to his brother-
supporters of law and order,
Michie, speaking before the Melbourne
Bankers’ Institute on “Free Coinage for Aus-
tralia,” said this country does not absolutely
depend on the Crown for the right to coin silver,

since, “by the Order-in-Oouncil which founded
Sydney Mint in ’55, and by the Constitution,
H.M. has parted with the prerogative of coining
money in Australia.” As a matter of technical
law—though not as a question of equity and just
rights—Michie is wrong. Sydney Mint cannot
coin silver money, because silver is not a legal
tender beyond the amount of 40s.
To show how determined the Queensland
black-labor party are to get their swindle through :
the leading organ of the slave-gang lately
announced that no letter addressed to it on the
Kanaka question would be published without the
author’s full name and address—so that he would
be a fair mark for the vengeance of the banks and
associated monopolies? Why doesn’t the paper
print under each leader the name of the writer—
and that of the man who told him to write it—
also a verbatim report of what happened when he
(the newspaper boss) was told by “theboard”
what to say? t
Last week the first GO of Griffilwraith’s
escaped cheap Italians struck Charters Towers
(Q.), arid found work at cutting timber for use in
the mines. That is to say, they offered to cut the
timber at a vastly-reduced rate,' and GO Australians
were promptly sacked to make room for them.
Nearly every Italian has now deserted the plan-
tations, and the Government, rather than acknow-
ledge the awful smash of its project, is supplying
them with rations and free railway passes to go
south or west or anywhere. Tin’s sort of thing,
with the Kanaka and the land-grant railway
syndicate swindle thrown in, is the beginning of
the end.

United States, whose President when out of office
inspired no personal loyalty; every country must have
a government to rule over the people ; an Austra-
lian Republican movement would attract all the
worst men in the country.” Parkes also said he had
in his mind a plan for “a grand union of the
English-speaking; race, to include America.”

Carington, by “faking” things in advance and
being “ghosted,” was cunning enough to conceal
from the general public of Australia, the diminu-
tiveness of the poor little brain which found a
roosting-place between the top of his yawn and
the bottom of his hair-parting. But there were
two or three occasions on which he clean “ g ave
himself away ”in N.S.W. A deputation once ap-
proached him on a momentous question, and
aware that they were coming, he got somebody—
probably the Lieut.-Governor —to fix up an
answer, reviewing, in a way, the arguments which
he understood the deputation intended using.
However, the deputation didn’t use the arguments
which Carington’s shadow had replied to, and so
Lord Yavvnington found himself “ in tiie soup"”
However, not daring to trust himself to say any-
thing extempore, he read off to the astonished
deputation the bulky MS. with which he had been
provided, and which had as much relevance to
the points at issue as the Paroo mosquitoes
have to a Scotch scratehing-post, and when

Sensational.
HOW AN AMERICAN DISCOVERY HAS
AWAKENED EUROPE.
Tub credit is dub to a Citizen of tub United States
BUT TUB BENEFITS ARE SHARED BY THE ENTIRE WORLD.
Considerable excitement exists among phy-
sicians in Europe as to the nature of tile most
dangerous of all modern diseases, and whether it
can be cured.
Ten years ago, Bright’s Disease of the kidneys
was pronounced incurable by almost the entire
medical faculty. To-day, many of them are in
doubt, and nearly all the most advanced declare,
that it not only can be regulated, but absolutely
cured.
High authorities have taken steps to ascertain
the exact views of the leading physicians of
Europe on the subject, and some of their opinions,
condensed, are given herewith :
Sir Morrell Mackenzie, one of the leading
physicians of England, said : —“ I would say,
generally, that Bright’s Disease is curable, but the
man or woman who is troubled with it must be
careful of every action, almost of every thought.”
Dr. William Edward Robson, Physician of the
Royal Navy, declared: —“Like the majority of
ray professional brethren, I have long regarded
Bright’s Disease as incurable. I think so no longer.
Hundreds of my patients have been cured by the
use of Warner’s “ Safe” Cure, and I am willing to
acknowledge and recommend thus frankly the
value of this great remedy. ’
Dr. Andrew Wilson, of the Royal Society of
Edinburgh, asserts: —“Warner’s “Safe” Cure is
of a safe character and perfectly reliable.”
Dr. Hoesch of Berlin, says :—“ I have used
Warner’s “Safe ” Cure myself as I have been the
victim, on taking the least cold, of rheumatism
and palpitation of the heart. This sensibility has
disappeared, also the action of the heart is
quieter.”
Mr. Gustav Weber, of Dessau, Germany,
affirms : —“ By the use of fifteen bottles of
Warner’s “Safe” Cure, my general health has
been restored, and 1 have completely cured myself
of Bright’s Disease of the kidneys.”
Dr. E. H. Whirsel-Huerlimann, of Whipeengen,
Switzerland, makes the following remarkable
assertion :—“ lam a living example that Bright’s
Disease is curable. I suffered with that complaint
for years, and know that improvement in appetite
and strength have been caused through the use of
Warner's “ Safe ” Cure.”
Dr. Dugardid Beaumetz, of the Academy of
Medicine, Paris, affirmed “That the danger in
Bright’s Disease results from the crippled con-
dition of the kidneys, which no longer take out of
the system poisons resulting from organic sub-
stances. The treatment consists in helping the
insufficient action of the kidneys.”
The above facts prove what has been persistently
asserted by 11. H. Warner and Co. for years, that
Bright’s Disease not only can, but has been cured,
and that permanently, and in countless instances.
The moral of all this is that no time should be lost
in applying this guaranteed remedy in any case of
kidney or urinary trouble.

unnt and saddle it was to the rolling of curses,
Snatching whip, snatching spurs, where they hung
& on the nail; , A ,
In his wrath old MTvor, head stockman, turned
Spitting'oaths with his head ’neath the flap of his
last hole in the girth with his teeth
I’lien "a hand on the pommel, a quick catch of
breath, , , . ,
. lift of the body, a swing to the right,
And ten half-broken nags with ten riders astraddle
\Ve sped, arrow-swift, for the heart of the night.
Thud of hoofs, thud of hearts, breath of man,
breath of beast,
With MTvor in front, but the rest heel to flank,
C„ , ve rode in a bunch down the steep river bank,
Churning up the black tide in the shallows like
Througif'the coolabahs, out on the plain, it
increased ,
Till we swung with the stride of the dingo-paek,
swooping
On the scent of weak mother with puny calf
drooping. . ... .
Staring eyes, swaying forms o er the saddle-bow
stooping, , . ,
With the wind in our shirts, grip of knee, grip of
LosingHground, falling back, creeping forward
again.
Behind us the low line of dark coolabah,
Overhead a sky spangled by planet and star ;
And to left, on our shoulder, the mighty Cross
flaring,
While afoot the quick rhythm of hoof-beats
disturbs . . ,
The moist silence of grasses and salty-leaved
herbs.
Steering on by the stars, over hollow and crest,
Tingling eyes—looking ou’t through a film of tears
From the slap of the wind—over forward-pricked
ears,
Over forehead and nose stretching out for the
west —
And into the face of the sombre night staring.
Threading in, threading out, through a maze of
sand rises
That spring either side, loom a moment, then flee—
Dim hillocks of herbage and sun-blasted tree—
Till again a dark streak of far timber arises,
And anon, through the thick of a lignum swamp
tearing
Bare tendrils, back-springing, switch sharp on the
knee.
Plain again, and again, with the speed of the
wind,
The long miles in the front join their comrades
behind ;
Then a sound in our ears, like to far summer
thunder,
Or the booming of surf in a southerly gale ;
And we shouted aloud, each to each in our
wonder,
For we knew that those beasts must have come
fast and far,
That they moaned, as the breaking of waves on a
bar.
But behold, overhead, the dark sky had grown
pale
White, clouded by blue, as is newly-skimrncd
milk,
And the dawn-spiders floated on threads of floss-
silk
As the guards of the sun drew aside the thick veil
And made ready to fling the dawn-portals asunder.
Still that sound swelled and rolled, thrilling deep
on the air,
Calling long, calling loud in the ear of each steed,
Bringing courage and strength in the hour of need,
And light’ning the weight of the burdens they
bare.
But that moment, behind us, upshot a red glare
As the sun swept the sky with a roseate sponge,
And MTvor’s blue-roan gave a rear, and a plunge,
A half sob, and so fell, like an overripe pear.
Not a rein did we pull, not a stride did we stay,
Speeding onward, and speeding, for long we could
hear,
Turning often aside, through the dew-laden
grasses
To crop a sweet mouthful; we needed no glasses
To see it was Fogarty, once and again,
And again did we hail, yet lie never looked round,
Neither made the least motion of hearing the
sound,
Riding on as a man who should ride in his sleep,
Or as one in the web of some deep-woven charm;
Bo he came through the grass—his horse striding
breast-deep
With a woman held close in the crook of his arm.
And her hair, all unbound, rippled over his
shoulder,
Bead black; and her brow—where the sweat of
fierce pain
Had dried—was brown-tinged as bronze is, but
colder,
Ah, many times colder, and as ho pulled rein,
He unwrapped saddle-blanket in which he had
rolled her,
And 10, the gay sunlight lit ominous stain,
Old Mac.’s maledictions ring loud in our rear,
As wo rode in hot haste from the incoming day.
Then all sudden, and strangely, we came face to
face
With the lead of the cattle, and 10, our long race
Was run out, and we drew up the horses, all
panting
In stress of the chase, and yet ready for more ;
And our eager ears drank in that thunderous roar,
While we watched the red squadrons come over
the levels
As if view-hulloed by a pack of night-devils ;
Cow and calf chasing heifer and lumbering steer,
With their grey, dripping nostrils, and eyes wide
with fear,
As if Burgess’ Cob* followed hard on their rear.
So we blocked them, and 10, the new sun laid a
slanting
Red finger on one who rode over the plain,
Steed treading full slowly, head drooping, slack
rein,
Where a murderous bullet had torn a blue vein,
And let out her young life, in a warm crimson
rain.
Then gently, he laid his sad load on the ground,
And with sorrowing glances we gathered around.
Then he turned to the west—with his eyes all
aflame,
With his brawny fists raised, calling witness from
Heaven ;
On his shoulder and flank the dark blood of the
slain—
And he hurled his curse back on the place whence
he came :
A loud curse, and a threat, that he yet would
stand even
With those of Monkyra who wrought this foul
shame.

AN OPTICAL EFFECT.
BULLETIN MAN (to intoxicated visitor from
country ) : “ Yon haven’t seen last
week’s issue? Why don’t you read
THE BULLETIN regularly?"
INTOXICATED VISITOR: “ Y’shee, I always
read it when I’m at home in the bush ;
but when I come to town I — hi c—don’t
shoe anythingsh.”
Though, to tell the God’s truth, we’d have done
just the same
In their place, and have reckoned it nothing but
right;
For the black girl and Fogarty quietly crept
On the Monkyra men in the dead of the night,
And it happ’ed that the watchman was weary,
and slept.
So the gin, who no doubt was a game little pullet,
Slipped in, arid brought both their night horses
away;
While Fogarty started the cattle that lay
On the camp, and the trick was bold it suc-
ceeded ;
For the Monkyra men, when their cattle stam-
peded,
Had nothing to send in pursuit but a bullet.
Yet that was as much as the little gin needed,
She made no great fuss though, nor murmured,
nor cried,
Only rode on the right of her lord till she died.
Her life ended well, nothing scamped, or by
halves;
Where she went, who can tell? But ice branded
the calves.

J. L. Sullivan offers to fight any white

the Cape Register, S.A., is dead, aged 40 years.
Colbcck was a man of brains. Brains too often

Ex-Canon Whitington who is going to
Macgregorland as a missionary, was once law-

Parkes has lectured before the bankers of
Sydney, on “the position of N.S. Wales in the

consideration with another,” banker Abraham
Friedman should have occupied the chair on the
occasion.
The fact that “ Jimmy|” Tyson has offered

Milner Stephen, the Sydney healer who

Parkes, the other night, related that when
Wright (now plain M.P.) was “Works, ’in the
N.S. W. Soudan-donkey Ministry, he was re*

stairs leading to his office, that it had an appoint-

“ Tut, tut, there is no time for anything of that
kind now; 1 am engaged in saving the dear old
Mother Country ! ”
Editor Curnow, of the S.M. Herald, at a
recent banquet, gave Lis definition of an editor.
“ To his mind, the editor of a newspaper was a
sort of speaking-tube or telephone, that gathered
together and carried on the messages of the great
public.” In other words, the public is the pig,
and the editor is the sausage-machine, and the
S.M. Herald is the finished sausage that comes
out at the other cud.
Mrs. Morriset, wife of the wry-mouthed
Commandant at Norfolklsland in the thirties, who
was also colonel of the 48th Regt.. died last week
at North Sydney, aged 90 years. One of her sons
was a superintendent of police, and another a
police-magistrate. We believe she outlived all
her family. The Colonel got the nick name from
having been shot, in the Peninsula, through the
mouth. His name does not carry a blessing with
it amongst the old hands.
E. H. Herrington, who not so very long
ago relinquished the Port Adelaide News. S.A.,
has been in his day—telegraph-operator, store-
keeper, local preacher, shorthand writer, temper-
ance lecturer, mesmerist, divining-rod man,
artist, journalist, M.P., and Minister of the
Crown. He still retains the power of blushing
clean through his peach-blossom countenance,
away down the lankiness of his profile right to his
Adam’s-apple, and clean round to his bumps of
destructiveness.
The late millionaire John Harris, of
Shane’s Park, N.S W., was once, in his droving
days, standing, roughly dressed, outside a mining
township pub., when a flash digger drove up in a
irap, and threw him the reins to hold. Jock took
them without saying a word, and waited. When
the digger climbed back into his bugery, lie threw
•lock a “fiver.” Jock flung the note back, with
the remark that five pounds wasu t enough in
those flush times for holding a fellow’s horse for
five minutes. The digger was so flabbergasted at
Jock’s front that ho “ slung him a tenner,” which
Jock calmly pocketed.
What People Say.
T. IRVINE, ESQ., TATHAM, RICHMOND
RIVER, N.S.W.
Writes under date February 2ft, 1801;—“I
write to let you know that I am a patron of your
wonderful Clements Tonic ; I have been a great
sufferer, and have read of Mrs. Moeller’s cure in
the newspapers; her case was nothing to mine,
but, thank God, through her letter I am cured,
and after the doctors had pronounced sentence of
death on me. lam very grateful to Mrs. Midler
for her letter. I have great pleasure in adding
my testimony to that of the many others cured
of serious diseases by the use of Clements Tonic ;
I have suffered terribly from liver and kidney
disease. Two years ago my strength began
rapidly to decline, I had dull headache, completely
lost my appetite, and was almost blind (failure of
sight is a symptom of Bright’s disease.) I
had tiger claw cramps in the calves of my legs,
and severe rheumatic pains, followed by diarrhoea;
strength continued to fail, accompanied by
extreme pallor of the face, puffed under the eyes,
and persistent swelling of legs, knees and ankles,
and my whole body was swollen to a wonderful
size ; sharp shooting pains pierced the heart, and
frequently chills and fever attacked me. The
swelling was so bad that I was afraid to even
drink a glass of water. I consulted a doctor, and
he examined my water, and he said it was a bad
case of liver disease, and also Bright’s disease of
the kidneys ; he prescribed medicine and liniments
with mustard baths. I said, “ Doctor, if you will
cure me I will pay you what you like.” He
replied ; “ I can hold out no hope for you.” I
said, “ That is very hard.” “ I never like to take
a man’s money,” said he, “without telling him
the truth, and I will come to you at any hour of
the night you may send for me.” He thought I
should soon die. I gave his treatment a fair trial,
but the swelling of my body increased so much
that I had to remain in bed. The pains increased
and extended all down the side, and my eyesight
was now almost completely gone. I consulted
another eminent medical man, who after sounding
me and testing my urine, said I had Bright’s
disease. I asked if he could cure me. He said
he would do his best, and if I would continue his
medicine I should improve. I did so, and it had
ut little more effect than water. Two friends of
mine called my attention to Mrs. Moeller’s letter
in the paper, who had been cured of the same
disease by Clements Tonic. I procured a supply,
and taking it strictly in accordance with the
directions, the swelling began to go down. I
kept up the use of Clements Tonic, and now,
thank God, I am cured ; my swellings have all
subsided ; my eyesight is as good as ever. I took
a good many bottles, but that is nothing, as IT
has cured me, and I cannot describe its value.”
Mr. Irvine’s case needs no comment. We have
no need to eulogise our remedy when disinterested
people give such endorsement as the above.

Society
The Windsor (Vic.) brick-and -cement
murderer was said to have kept a restaurant
in Sydney. It would be interesting to figure
out the number of murderers who have, during
some portion of their lives, been identified
with restaurants and sausage-shops. Years ago,
the present writer and an aged companion went
into a Sydney restaurant, behind the counter of
which was a cross-eyed woman selling mutton-
pies. “By Jove!” exclaimed the old fellow,
between ids mouthfuls, “ where have I seen that
face before?” And then, after half-an-hour’s
memorising, “ I have it. That’s Sarah Gale, the
paramour and criminal confederate of Greenacre,
whom I saw tried with him in London.” And
so she was. She had married respectably (she’s
now in heaven, sweet soul), and had taken to the
minced-meat business.
# # #
De Quincoy’s imaginary lecturer on
“ Murder as one of the Fine Arts ” was named
by the author, “Williams.” In Wilkie Collins’s
“The Haunted Hotel,” a murdered body was
hidden beneath a hearthstone. If the Windsor
(Vie.) murderer, Williams, had only been able to
leave a walking ghost about the scen£ of his
butchery, the coincidences would have been still,
more faithful to literary legends.
* * *
A servant girl at the Federal Coffee Palace,
Melbourne, stated that a couple answering to the
description of “Williams” and his murdered
companion stayed there for a few days and “had
the appearance of being married people.” That is
to say, the man was “studiously unkind and
insulting to the lady.”
* * *
When a big mail steamer is coming out
from England with a crowd of passengers, there
is always on board the inevitable girl on her way
to marry the old sweetheart whom she hasn’t seen
for several years—the sweetheart who has been
working to make a home for her, and who has at
last written telling her to come out and be bis
pansy-blossom for evermore. First, that girl is
sea sick. Secondly, she is physically well, but is
reticent and romantic, and sits round on deck at
night looking at the moon, and extracts letters
from hidden recesses in the vicinity of her bosom,
and looks surreptitiously at a photograph.
Thirdly, she feels the want of a confidant,
and tells every soul on board, barring only
the stokers and the deck-sweep, all about her little
love-story. There was a girl of that sort on board
a recent mail-boat, and her tale, as she related it
to the captain and all the officers and the under-
stewardess, was a very touching one. “It is six
years since I saw Harry,” she would say sadly,
“ and I really don’t know if I love him now. But
if when we meet I feel a thrill here” and she
would lay her hand regretfully somewhere on the
region of her waist, “ I’ll know that it’s all right.”
When Harry came down to meet her there were
82 people standing about to know if she felt a
thrill, but she was bundled into a cab and driven
away so hurriedly that the point was left un-
settled.

Gorgons, Cyclops, and coloured persons
will be at a premium after the evidence given of
their utility during a recent Sydney trial. They
are sovereign specifics for vagrant amativeness,
and no household should be without one of them.
Henceforth we may read announcements some-
thing like the following :

Dear Bulletin, — I am glad to notice your
remarks re the insolvency of E. 8. Smithurst, and
your suggestion that united action betaken on the
part of the newspaper proprietors of N.B.W. is
worthy of being acted upon. Those who areawaroof
the circumstances of the case can scarcely withhold
their warmest sympathy, and whenever a call is
made I will be glad to forward you my cheque
for a guinea. Yours, &c.» J.C. Windsor, March
12, 1892.

over .£20,000 is 5 per cent, to children and grand-
children, 10 per cent, to other blood relations, and
13 per cent, to strangers in blood. If a man deeds
his property as a gift while alive, he lias to pay
the probate-duty all the same, for the deed cannot
be registered till this is paid. Such has been the
law here since 1885, when one of the queer misers
in Auckland died. His name fitly expressed the
hardness of his nature, and, although he used to
look up even the dry bread when lie thought his
children had eaten enough, he could not bear to
seo them deprived of the probate-dutv. After a
long illness, borne with Christian fortitude, and
by no moans extravagant use of medicine, he
signed the deeds of gift to his different children,
on which deeds a stamp-duty of ten-shillings only
was payable, and a few hours later expired. The
probate-duty on nearly a quarter-of-a million was
thereby saved, but the tax-collectors arched their
backs and sharpened their claws to prevent such
a thing happening again.—Yours, Conveyancer,

A swell of the first water lately called
upon a Southern inspector of prisons, and intro-
duced himself as the Governor of a South African
Gaol, was well received, and invited the inspector
to his “club.” Social courtesies were daily
reciprocated, now at the inspector’s office, anon at
the club. The inspector sounded his friend’s
praises, and introduced him everywhere as a good
fellow on tour. But, one day, when the “good
fellow ” was at the inspector’s office, a clerk from
the principal gaol jostled against him on the
stairs—and recognised him as a discharged convict
from one of the inspector’s own gaols.

“ Poor thing ! ” exclaimed Aspinall, Q.C.,

“ And, gentlemen, one witness is this venerable

A certain squatter, lately in Parlia-
ment, took up land per dummy—said dummy
was an Arab, named Selim. By-and-bye the
squatter wished for an additional conditional
purchase, but said Selim being legally “ full up”
it couldn’t be done. To overcome this difficulty
the squatter brings Selim to the nearest town,
has him baptised, and thus makes a Christian
(name James Brown) of him; then goes back to
the local land-office and takes up an additional
C.P. in James Brown’s name. Passed by Land
Eoard.
Nearly every restaurant-keeper in Sydney
will remember a certain prosperous-looking, fat
man who used to dine, in a promiscuous way, all
over the city. He was well-dressed, and wore a
watch-chain, a shiny bat, and an umbrella. The
umbrella was old, and moth-eaten in a thousand
holes, and its ribs were all stove-in and splintered
—it was a sort of ash-heap umbrella, in fact, but the
handle was all right, and it was nicely done up in
an oilskin case. The owner lived on this umbrella.
He would trot into a restaurant and eat as if
there was no hereafter, and then ho would walk
up to the pay-counter and feel in his pockets for
the half-crown. Just here a look of pained sur-
prise would come over his countenance, and he
would remark that, by a most astonishing and
unforeseen combination of circumstances, he had
somehow come out without any money. “If you
will allow me,” he would remark cheerfully, “I
will leave my umbrella as security until to-
morrow.” Then the proprietor would take stock
of him, and he looked so solvent that he invari-
ably declined the umbrella, and remarked that
the customer could pay any time lie was passing.
Next day he would go and tender the umbrella in
another restaurant, with the same result. He at«
his way in this manner right along Pitt street,
Sydney, from one end to the other. Next, ha
used-up the side streets, and ate them all bare,
from Bridge-street to the railway-station ; he also
dined successfully through Castlereagh and Eliza-
beth-streets. When they were finished he started
on George-street, and fed systematically from
Circular Quay as far as Bathurst-street, and then
the scheme fell through. At the place where ho
had his last dinner a hard-featured lady, when he
had explained the circumstances, took the
umbrella from him without the slightest compunc-
tion, and he was so broken-up by the loss of his
stock-in-trade that he never, so far as we know,
made a fresh start. The gamp that goes too
often to the dining-room is sure to be seized at
last.

A German who suicided a few weeks ago
left a letter behind him, stating that he did it
because life was “too monotonous.” Which,
after all, is about the most logical reason that
could well be devised. We often feel that we
will suicide some day on account of the building
across the street, simply because we have seen
the miserable old thing so often. Yet we suppose
no jury will have pluck enough to bring in a
verdict that we “ Died of the house opposite.”

A PATRIOTIC DITTY.
I deal in stocks and shares, and stand
By all our institutions great,
And ho who owns a block of land
I deem a saviour of the State ;
But the working man’s a shady lot—
Says the Young Victorian Patriot.
I do support the Dual Vote,
For brain is brain, and earth is earth,
A tall silk hat and gloves denote
The gent of special weight and worth,
Which the working man, of course, is not—
Says the Young Victorian Patriot.
Though labour, in its proper place,
I dc not wish to underrate,
’Tis clear to me in any case
That Capital maintains the State.
A straw for democratic “ rot”—
Says the Young Victorian Patriot.
I hold that in the shipping strike
A traitor spirit was displayed ;
The rates of pay employers like
Are naturally best for trade.
The working man’s-(no matter what)—
Says the Young Victorian Patriot.
God save the Queen and bless the Squire,
And all our institutions great;
The kind of person I admire
Alone is useful to the State,
So all the rest can go to pot—
Says the Young Victorian Patriot.
LYRICS OF THE STAGE.
(The Mirth-Provoking “Dam!”)
The drama holds a mirror bright
To Human Nature’s gaze,
Inciting us to love the right
And turn from wicked ways ;
The author strives with caustic pen
To prick a social sham,
But always seems most witty when
His funny-man says “ Dam ! ”
One source of pleasure never dries,
But emulates the Brook,
All moth and rust that word defies—
’Tis ever in the “ book.”
It follows plays around, ye ken,
Like Mary’s little lamb,
And worlds unborn will cackle when
The funny-man says “ Dam ! ”
The action may be hanging fire,
The story going slow ;
The villain’s victims don’t expire
And finish up their woe.
Perchance the hero now and then
Is overdosed with “ jam ”
But O ! the house looks happy when
The funny-man says “Dam ! ”
It pleases old and young alike ;
The sinner or the saint,
That exclamation seems to strike
As wonderfully quaint.
You see mannna with daughters ten
And pa (who’s standing Sam)
Exchanging mirthful glances when
The funny-man says “ Dam ! ”
One day I hope to score a hit;
I have a play unique—
’Twill suit the stalls and charm the pit,
And make the circle shriek.
I read it in my lonely den,
And, here and there, I am
Inserting fresh occasions when
The funny-man says “ Dam ! ”

felt in all his pockets, and there wasn’t a cent in
any of them. Then the publican remarked that it
didn’t matter—he could pay. him next evening—
and the rich man drank his beer and went away.
That was five months ago, and he has never been
in since. When he leaves his office in the evening
he walks down Bridge-street to George-street,
goes along George-street, walks up Hunter-street,
and catches his omnibus in Pitt-street. It is only
twenty or thirty yards to the ’bus in a straight
line, and it is a-quarter of a mile the way he goes
now, but if he took the straight line the publican
might possibly rush out as he was passing and ask
him for the threepence. Up to date he has walked
neatly thirty miles to save those three coppers,
and has wrecked about two pair of boots, which
he will probably make good by reducing his
clerk’s salary. Thus does the great virtue of
Thrift once more come uppermost.

Dog-meat is the latest American remedy
for consumption, and is said to be a great success.
A young lady at San Francisco, who was suffering
from phthisis, ate seven dogs in two weeks, and
the results were most gratifying. The Bulletin
strongly recommends this treatment for two
reasons—first, it may possibly cure the consump-
tive, and, second, it will stop the dog from barking
at night. We know 120 dogs which urgently want
to be eaten in a good cause, and we also know
four consumptives who owe their disease to a
cold, caught while trying to shift a mongrel out
of the back premises on a damp night. There is a
great moral in all this. In future, when a man
can’t sleep owing to an excited stray pup in the
yard, he will simply rush out with a kni r e
and fork and eat the animal. Then the
dog himself will be a guarantee against any
bad effects which may arise through flying
round in an abbreviated garment amid the dewy
grass, and the only danger seems to be that the
animal might turn out to be a St. Bernard, and
consequently be too large to consume, and an
unfinished dog might not be a sufficient protection,

The will of the late John McCulloch, a S.A.
squatter, was thus worded :
I will and bequeath all my property that I own at pre-
sent, and everything that I may obtain hereafter, to my
wife and her children.
In a “friendly interpretation suit,” the Court dfc*
cided that the term “ her children” only applied
to the issue of the McCulloch marriage, and did
not include any future issue by any subsequent
marriage which the widow might contract. A life-
estate in the widow, with remainder to her
McCulloch offspring at her decease, was decreed.

William of Germany distinguished himself
by not taking the trouble to be deeply afflicted
when his cousin Clarence died. The sad news
reached his Majesty whilst he was out shooting
rabbits, but instead of tottering home in a
paroxysm of grief, with the crown on the back of
his head and a damp imperial handkerchief
waving in the wind, he went on shooting rabbits
as before. Also, the heartless monarch neglected
to attend any divine se’rviee for the benefit of his
relative’s soul, and finally, he reduced the usual
period of Court anguish from three weeks to ten
days. All of which conduct has deeply wounded
the feelings of thousands of superior middle-class
ladies in. England, and if the Emperor William
were to die to-morrow they would not go into
mournirig for him The least bit. At any rate, they
would not buy neiv mourning for him —so, there

A Bulletin correspondent thus gossips :
The novelist’s conception of a detected murderer is not
home out in real life, according to the writer’s experi-
onoc. I remember when going up coast in the Egmont
somewhere about 77 we had Cunningham, the murderer
of “Frank the Austrian,” aboard in charge of a young
Brisbane policeman, who gave him a good deal of freedom
during daylight, calling him below quietly at dusk and
putting the “ darbies ” on. The constable camped in the
bunk above Cunningham, and, in answer to my inquiries,
informed me that he always slept as peacefully as a child,
He was a quiet-looking young fellow, and most of us
for’ard were assured of hisinnocence,yet,crebeing“turned
off,” he confessed to the cowardly murder of poor Frank,
Watsort, the Cowl-Cowl murderer was employed at
Carrathool, erecting a slaughter-yard for John Parr, about
12 months before the deed was committed. He camped
in the hotel stable-loft, and after he left, the hotel groom
found a most artistically-made gag under the bags which
Watson had had for a hipper. It consisted of a sheep-
shank bone, neatly notched for the whipcord strings, and
was passed round among “all-hands” ere anyone
“ tumbled ”to its use. I was on the Gunbar road when
they were bringing Watson down on the coach. Although
the Cowl-Cowl murder had been the talk of the district

Watson suspected of the crime. My employer had a

caught sight of Watson inside. “Ilulloa, Charley!”!
exclaimed, “where are you bound for?” —when, half-
extending my hand to “shake,” I sighted the iron orna-
ments he wore on wrists and ankles. You may be sure I
took in the situation quickly enough then, though with
such an eerie feeling that “ you might have knocked me
down with a feather.” Anyhow, that question of mine
was rather a poser for Master Watson. —“ Tub Palmer.”

some cases, the same wedding-present would pass
through Attenborough s hands halr-a-dozen times
before settling down to private life and domestic
use. As soon as a bridegroom sold the claret jug,

it for presentation to another happy pair, who, in
due course, would do the usual deal with Atten-
borough, and so on.
That medical witness who climbs cheer-
fully into the box, and testifies that the speck of
gore on the prisoner’s boot is human blood, ami
gets him hanged accordingly, had better take a
back seat for evermore. An eminent British
medical authority announces that no scientist
under the sun can tell human blood from the
blood of any other mammal. The difference con-
sistsentirely in the size of the corpuscles; in the case
of man they measure generally about one-four-
thousandth part of an inch in diameterand one-ten-
thousandth of an inch thick; in the case of clogs,
horses, and the like they are about the same
thickness, and perhaps an eighth of that four-
thousandth part of an inch wider round the waist.
When a crime has been committed the bush doctor
—the man who removes legs with an axe and
treats every complaint with blue pills—gets an
old, dry spot, and having measured the invisible
corpuscles with a two-foot rule, he swears that,
“ to the best of his belief,” it is a splash of human
blood. The court credits his statement because
he is a doctor, and he is telling the strict truth
because he does believe it to be human blood, and
he believes that way because the policeman who
brought the spot round to his shop believed it also,
and yet he is just as good an authority on the
subject as a bricklayer or a sign-painter, and an
ordinary butcher is probably more reliable than
any of them. The blood-spot business, like the
Tipperary-boot-heel-tracking business, is played-
out.

formerly of Ballarat, Vic. Let’s moisten the
memories.— The Dipsomaniac.
Rebecca Cohen, a woman who died a
horrible death lately in Sydney hospital, left
behind her a gruesome and pathetic story of the
ways of the “unregistered practitioner ’’who lives
upon the ignorant person that doesn't feel well. Mere
than a year ago—so her own statement is reported
to have run—a cancer started to grow on her
lower lip, and she was urged by the hospital
authorities to have it cut out. She declined, and
went to a certain “Dr.” Hood, in one of the
suburbs, who undertook to cure her without an
operation for the trifling sum of £3 a week.
Finding that his patient was unable to pay this
amount he reduced the charge to £l, and for 12
months made a regular income out of the miser-
able sufferer—in fact, he is said to have col-
lected the money with remorseless regularity till
within a few days of her death. His treatment,
according to the patient’s story, consisted in drop-
ping some strong acid on the cancer —a process
which was just as scientific as if he had treated it
with the actual cautery. Between the cancer and
the medicine alarge hole was gradually burnt from
the mouth right down to the neck, and the flesh at
the sides of this gruesome orifice was all blistered
and destroyed. The doctor, in fact, was getting
on favourably towards removing all the front part
of his client by a process of slow combustion, but
after a year of it the half cooked woman gave him
up and died. The immediate cause of her
death was want of food, her mouth being partly
burnt away and the rest of it so decom-
posed that eating or drinking became practically
impossible. The case is, at time of writing, still
being sorted out in the Coroner’s Court, and the
“ doctor ” complains that the poor mangled woman
didn’t pay him regularly ; also, he states that he
can’t find sundry important documents which, if
he could find them, would utterly demolish all
suspicions, and he “disremembers ” the meaning
of the “A. 8.” which follows his name on his
door-plate. He has some objects in a bottle
which look like oysters, but which really are
cancers extracted by his process from various
grateful patients. Also, he has some valuable
documents in the Maori tongue, and he declares
that he took half-an-ounce of cancerous flesh from
Mrs. Cohen daily, which would make 51b. of
cancer in all. Sundry patients who gave testi-
monials about their “cures” have rolled up to
explain or modify or withdraw their testimonials.
Up to date, the coroner’s jury don’t seem to like
“Dr. Hood.”

of Ids visit to Spurgeon last year. This is a most
cunning sarcasm, under the guise of puffery.
Hatcher was surprised by Ihe luxurious Beulah

garden, and even the kitchen garden and fowleries
roused Hatcher’s gorge, which mounted as he
beheld the superb barouche, pair of unsurpassed
high-steppers, and the liveried coachman “who
lo >ked quite a gentleman,” while the stables were
“ equal in their way to those of Windsor Castle.”
Good old—what shall we say?
Dear Bulletin,— At Laidley, Q., the other
evening, a meeting was convened in the “Victoria
flail” to “support” the Griffilwraith Kanaka
policy. The hall was packed to overflowing, about
MOV) crushing themselves into it somehow. A
riotous Bedlam ensued, in which the Black-labour
advocates were outnumbered at every vote.
Nevertheless, the chairman declared every resolu-
tion unanimously carried. The resolutions:—
1. That tliis meeting views with great satisfaction the
opinions expressed in the manifesto issued by Sir S. W.
Griffith, and pledges itself to support the proposals.
Amendment to same: That this meeting views the return
of Queensland to Black Labour with horror and disgust,
and, also, that they pledge themselves to do their utmost
to prevent such. Motion declared unanimously carried !
2. That, this meeting is of opinion that it would lie to
tiie best interests of the people of Queensland to extend
the term to 15 instead of 10 years, during which it is
proposed that Polynesian labour may be introduced into
Queensland. Declared carried unanimously !!
3. That this meeting is of the opinion that the time has
arrived when all future railways, where practicable, should
he constructed on the land-grant principle. Amendment
to same: That this meeting condemns the Government
from start to finish. Motion declared carried unani-
mously !! !
Cheers for Griffith ; groans for Griffith ; chaos.
An outdoor meeting was afterwards held —“ much
larger and very orderly ” (see Ipswich Advocate
report)—at which the platform was a dray. An
effigy of Griffith was prominently in evidence.
Resolved :
That it is unnecessary and uncalled-for to introduce
black-labour in Queensland.
The Griffith dummy was kerosened, and about to
be burnt, when Constable Fairbrother forbade the
illumination. So the boys made a football of it,
and kicked the effigy to smithereens.—Yours,
Straight Wire.

WOMEN AND FIREARMS
Ihe condition of terror to which the sight of a
mouse, a coc' roach, or a pistol reduces a woman
is phenomenal; yet the same frail creature can
stand the ordeal of a marriage ceremony or a
chri.-teniug without the slightest embarrassment,
while the natural protector of ,l tlie sex,” who
under ordinary circumstances looks big and talks
bigger, cannot face cither of the two last mentioned
trials without feeling fifty ways at once, and
expiriencing a sensation that causes him to
devoutly wish that a good healthy earthquake
would come along and swallow up ail that is left
of his diminished former self. But show the
average woman a gun or a pistol, and she will
shrink away and cry “Oh, dear,” and “Oh,
don’t,’’and “ Oh, for mercy sake,”and will tremble
like a leaf even though the weapon be without
lock, stock, or barrel. With a man however—
how different! He will take up the shooting-iron
with as much nonchalance as he would sample a
first-class brand of whiskey, cock it, peer into the
muzzle with a critical expression in his eye, try
the spring of the trigger, and—finish a good pay
ing job for the doctor or the undertaker.
There can be no doubt about it; man in number-
less ways shows his superiority over woman.
Seriously speaking, though, the opportunity of
women, and with it her bravery and fortitude,
comes in the hour when trouble or sickness affects
those who are dear to her. Then it is that she
becomes a ministering angel, in whose keeping the
well-being and safety of a household depends, and
no prudent housewife ever neglects to keep in
stock a bottle or two of St. Jacobs Oil ready for
use in the event of accident or disease overtaking
either herself, the breadwinner, or one of the olive
branches of the family. A great trait in woman’s
character is that she is ever ready to praise the
bridge that carries her over—hence the following
unsolicited testimonial from Mrs. Calvert, of
Darlington: “I have suffered a great deal from
rheumatics in my hands and shoulders. I have
tried a great many things for it, but have found
nothing but St. Jacobs Oil to do me any good.”
This renowned medicine may be had of any
druggist or storekeeper.

FACTS THAT ASTONISH!
People can’t understand how it is done, yet the
patent fact remains that there is nothing im-
possible about it. This reflection is the outcome
of an announcement by the famed Waterbury
Watch Company that to their former triumphs in
the manufacture of thoroughly reliable time-
keepers they have added still another. This time
they lead the trade in producing two entirely
new series of watches, in nickel, sterling silver,
and rolled gold, in the following styles: Series
“K,” gentlemen’s size, short-wind, stem-set, six
jewels, compensation balance, enamelled dial
(Roman or Arabic), and all the latest improve-
ments; series “N,” ladies’ size, a beautiful highly-
finished watch, with either full or Chatelaine dial.
The astonishing thing is that these watches, at
once elegant both in design and finish, and
unequalled for accuracy, are now selling in Aus-
tralia at the following astonishingly low prices:
Series “K,” nickel case 275. (id., sterling silver
455., rolled gold (13 years’ guarantee) G3s.; series
“N,” nickel 255., sterling silver 405., rolled gold
555. No one should think of purchasing a watch
without seeing these new wonders. There is
positively nothing in their line that can approach
them.

According to Coghlan, N.S. Wales has
13,289 full-blood Chinese, and 807 Mongolian half-
castes. Of these, 001 are females, who number
.150 full-blooded and 415 half castes. The great
majority of male Chinese arc between 21 and 55
years ; most of the females are below 13 years,
though there are a good many between 21 and 35
years. Thus the Chinese number nearly 1.20 per
cent, of the N.S.W. population, leaving out the
aborigin s. Long live the leprosy!
Berry, the English hangman, has resigned
owing to the interference of some doctors who
made him hang a long murderer at the end of a
long rope, whereby the defendant's head was
nearly torn off. The doctors made the rope long,
and the man was long naturally, and legal etiquette
forbade Bprry to seize upon a short man who
might have fitted the situation and hang him
instead, and the execution was a misfit all round.
A cheerful cablegram from Hanover (Germany)
tells of another execution which went wrong
there, but nothing is said of that executioner
resigning—possibly he is a coarse, thick-skinned
person. The knife of the local guillotine somehow
failed to remove the head in this instance, sj the
gentleman in charge seized the partially-severed
criminal and dragged him apart amid much bad
language from the crowd. The crowd has very
liitle sympathy for an embarrassed hangman.
Three young men have developed in Bris’
bane, Q.. a new method of cashing forged cheques.
Having obtained a blank cheque, the name of a
“good mark” would be.forged by No. 1. Next,
they would select some hotel, near which there
was a shop doing a daily cash trade-say, a
butcher's. The forged cheque would be carefully
crossed and marked “Bank.” Next, No. 2would
endorse the cheque, forging the name of the
butcher for that purp. se ; he would then scribble
a note somewhat to this effect : “ Dear Bung,—
Am short of change; kindly cash accompanying
cheque which I have endorsed. —Yours, Bonks.
Then No. 3, in his shirt-sleeves, with a shop-apron
on, and a stub of a pencil over one ear, would
hurry over to Boniface, who would fall into the
trap every time. The trio of swindlers have since
fallen into the “ traps ” themselves.
At Launceston, Tas., a man was summoned
for having used abusive language.. The plaintiff
and a string of witnesses swore to having heard
him use certain very queer expressions. His
lawyer did not put him in the box, but stood him
up on end in Court, nice and clean and angelically
smiling, and, pointing at him with the right
index-finger, said—“ Your worship", I ask you,
as men of the world, as experts in physiognomical
science, which, from the nature of your daily
duties, you, being men of understanding, must be
—I ask you, your worships, if you think it likely,
nay, even if you think it possible, that such a
nice-looking old gentleman, whose features beam
with benevolence and human sympathy, whose
least expression is a benediction and a sermon —if
such a gentleman could use the language attri-
buted to him?” Discharged, without a stain upon
his character.
Little Judge Casey is back in Melbourne

A member of the Free Kirk in a Scotch
town recently presented his particular kirk with a
stained-glass window, depicting the four Evan-
gelists on the outer margin and leaving a blank
space for future consideration. An elder, asked
what they were likely to put there* replied,
“ Weel, it’sjist a toss-up atween Dawvitt Simp-
son, oor auld me.nister, an’ oor Saviour.”
A Melbourne suburban Mayor called a

Dear Bulletin, —Do you know that up
in tropical Queensland, where the sugar-cane
flourisheth and the mosquito peacefully roosts on
the alligator’s tongue, the niggers who form the
night-shift on the sugar-mills always bathe in
molasses preparatory to commencing duties, in
order to keep the dragon-souled pest from biting
their naked bodies ?—-The Real Mackav.

Head. —‘ A Golden
Slianty/
"Tambaroora Jim."
(FOR THE BULLETIN.)
He never drew a sword to fight a dozen foes alone,
iNoi gave a life to save a life no better than In's
own.
Ht) lived because be had been born—the hero of
uiy song—
And fought the battle witii his fist whene’er he
fought a wrong.
Yet there are many men who would do anything
for him—
.A simple chap as went by name of “ Tarnbaroora
Jim.”
He used to keep a shanty in the “ Come-and-find-
it scrub,”
And there were few but knew the name of Tam-
baroora's pub.
He wasn t great in lambing-down, as many land-
-1 irds are,
And never was a man loss fit to stand behind a
bar—
Off-hand, as most bush natives are, and freckled,
tall, and slim,
A careless native of the land was “Tarnbaroora
J mi.”
hen people said that loafers took the profit from
his pub.,
Hed ask them how they thought a chap could do
( without his grub ?
Hed say, “ I’ve gone for days myself without a
bite or sup-
Oh ! I’ve been thro’ the mill and know what ’tis
to be hard-up.”
He might have made his fortune, but he wasn’t in
the swim,
For no one had a softer heart than “ Tarnbaroora
Jim.”
One dismal day I tramp’d across the Come-and-
find-it Flats
A\ith “Ballarat Adolphus,” and a mate of
; Ballarat’s;”
Twas nearly night and raining fast, and all our
things were damp,
We’d no tobacco, and our legs were aching with
the tramp;
We couldn't raise a cent., and so our lamp of hope
was dim ;
And thus we struck the shanty kept by “ Tam-
baroora J im,”
We dropped our swags beneath a tree and squatted
in despair,
But Jim came out to watch the rain, and saw us
sitting there ;
He came and mutter’d, “I suppose you haven’t
half-a-crown,
But come and get some tucker, and a drink to
wash it down.”
And so we took our blueys up and went along
with him,
And then we knew why bushmen swore by “ Tam-
baroora Jim.”
We sat beside his kitchen fire and nursed our tired
knees,
And blessed him when we heal'd the rain go
rushing thro’ the trees.
He made us stay, altho’ he knew we couldn’t
raise a bob,
And tuckered us until we rose some money on a
job.
And many times since then we’ve filled our glasses
to the brim,
And drunk, in many pubs., the health of “ Tam-
baroora Jim.”
A man need never want a meal while Jim had
“ junk ” to carve,
For “ Tarnbaroora” always said a fellow couldn’t
starve.
And this went on until he got a bailiff in his pub.,
Thro’ helping chaps as couldn’t raise the money
for their grub.
And so, one rainy evening, as the distant range
grew dim,
He humped his bluey from the Flats- did “Tam-
baroora Jim.”
I miss the fun in Jim’s old bar—the laughter and
the noise,
The jolly hours I used to spend on pay-nights
witii the boys.
But that’s all past, and “ vain regrets” are useless,
I’ll allow;
They say the Come-and-.find-it Flats are all de-
serted now.
Poor “ Tarnbaroora’s ” dead, perhaps, but that’s
all right with him,-
Saint Peter cottons on to chaps like “Tarnbaroora
Jim.”
I trust that lie and I may meet where starry fields
are grand,
And “liquor up” together in the pubs, in spirit-
land.
But if you chance to drop on Jim while in the
West, my lad,
You won’t forget to tell him that I want to see
,him bad.
I want to shake his hand again—l want to shout
for him—
I want to have a glass or two with “ Tarnbaroora
Jim.”
HENRY LAWSON.

OPINIONS OF THE PRESS
Proving the Wonderful Cures to be Genuine.
—
“Herr Eassmussen’s World-famed Denmark Universal Pills are
purely Herbal, and is the best remedy in the world for curing and
preventing disease.”—The Times.
“ Herr Eassmussen’s, the Celebrated Danish Herbalist, well-
known Herbal .Remedies have been the means of performing many
great cures during the last few years, as his numerous testi-
monials will prove. ’—Sydney Bulletin.
“ Here E ASSMUSSENhas shown ns some highly complimentary
Testimonials which he has received, certifying to important
cures effected hy his Remedies.”— Sydney Evening News.
“We have been shown some excellent Testimonials of the
great cures performed by Herr Rassmussen, tbe Celebrated
Danish Herbalist. Herb Eassmussen is a gentleman who bas
gained for himself a reputation in the medical world of herbal
science. He has been practising as a qualified herbalist so long in
Sydney that his name has become known throughout Mew South
Wales and Australia.”—Australian Star.
“ We are continually receiving letters from Here Rassmussen’3
Cured Patients, requesting us to make known the wonderful
virtues his world-renowned Herbal Remedies contain.”—
Sydney Weekly News.

throughout tbe Southern Hemisphere. He was presented with a
magnificent Gold Medal for some of his marvellous cures.” —
Balmain Leader.
“Herr Eassmussen is too well and vourably known to the
Australian public to require any additional praise from ‘ Truth,*
His Herbal Remedies are unequalled.”— Sydney Truth.
“ The remarkable Cures effected by Here Eassmussen’s Herbal
Remedies are pretty generally known.”— Balmain Observer,
“Here Bassmussen, we are glad to say, as a Medical Herbalist,
holds the highest place in the Colonies, and enjoys the confidence of
many of the leading people in H.S. Wales, Victoria, and (Queens-
land.”—(Jooktown Courier, Queensland,

“ Herr Eassmussen’s Cures are so remarkable that we make no
apology for referring to some of them. Mr. Ramsden’s case is the
most wonderful, and he cured him in six weeks, after all the
Sydney doctors gave him up. We may also state that a gentleman
in this district, who has been a martyr to the demon Dyspepsia for
more than two years, after trying several “doctors” with no
benefit whatever, is recovering under Herr Rassmussen’s Herbal
Treatment. In this age of unblushing quackery it is well to find
a man of Herr Rassmusseu’s undoubted skill, and we wish him a
long life to continue bis useful mission in the cause of suffering
humanity.”— Kangaroo Valley Pioneer, N ts.W.

ness, including a beautiful Gold Medal, brought him into the front
rank of Botanic Scientists ; now be is tbe Proprietor and Discoverer
of the famous Denmark Herbal Remedies, all of which have
secured the honest support of the people, not only of Australia,
but Africa, the United States, the British Kingdom and Italy.
It is not for us to enumerate tbe various remedies prepared by this
really learned man, but having seen and examined letters from all
parts of tbe world, we are assured that he has saved a world of
suffering and cured people of many complaints, after they had
given up all hope.”— The Australian Workman.— Sydney,
January 9th, 1892.

failure; why not. try' steel-spikes under the toe-nails, or
dropping ice-water on the shaven skull, or “ an ey e for an

You assert that The Bulletin opposes nigger labour
because the cry pleases the working classes. Tub
Bulletin isn’t run to please the working classes; it is
run to please ourselves-to enable us to say, inside the
libel-law, just exactly what we like to say every week of
the yea--. The Bulletin has clearly two advantages over
tnost other papers : it is not dependent on the support of
any one locality, but circulates all over and far beyond
Australasia; it is, unlike most other papers, able, to say
what its conductors believe, for they are working journa-
lists, who are their own masters. The soul of the average
newspaper man belongs to “ the Board,” and praised he

“J. Ryan”: What made you select this paper of all
others as the medium for an article on fowls? “G.
Junor”: You say, “Nature can never bring into exist-
ence more than she can comfortably' support.” Your
theory breaks down right here. What Nature—if there is
such a thing—can do when she is let loose no one knows
yet. Call round again in 50,000 centuries and see. Mean-
while we won’t commit ourselves “W.M.G.” (Ade-

Attorney-General on more than one occasion appeared
against the Grown, notably in the Sergeant Webster case.
“ Hiccup”: Your Maori story is staler than the most
ancient Maori generation-stick “G.L.D.”: The words
of “The Song that reached my Heart” are clumsy and
commonplace, their sentiment alonecommending them to
the public. Your parody is still more clumsy and common-
place and has nothing in it to commend it to anyone.
“F.G.”: “Man, Wife, &c.,” is a nicely-written story
made out of no v isible materials. But even the best
meat-pie is no good without the meat. “ Eucalyptus ” ;
A disorganised cataract of snakes, shrieks, and howling
devilment .. “Vrrehs”: Both stories gently, but firmly,

utterly purposeless, foolish, unmeaning spectre, hanging
a stereotyped iron chain in a way that doesn't arouse the
slightest interest “A.V.G.” (Carlton); To hand....
“G. 8.” : Your pictorial joke doesn’t appeal to the naked

Extract from a Salvation preacher’s speech
at Hamilton (M.L.) ; -

The most productive farm in Australasia
must surely be that of John Grigg, Canterbury
(M.L.). Its area is 10,000 acres. The average
wheat crop is 230,000 bushels, and the average
stock run comprise. 12,000 sheep, 700 cattle, 500
horses, and 1000 pigs. Besides that he fattens
15,000 bought sheep annually, and during the last
two years he has sent 10,000 frozen lambs to Lon-
don. He employs 150 men who bank £l5OOO of
their savings every year. During the last three
years he has paid an annual average of JEISCO in
railway-freight. This wonderful farm is known
hroughout Canterbury as the Land of Goshen.
SPORTING NOTIONS.
Apropos of the conviction of Smith, alias
Adams, for distributing swindling sweep-circulars bear-
ing no imprint, G. H. Reid, for defendant, asked in court
why the police didn’t also prosecute the genuine
Adams whose circulars likewise bore no imprint?
The fact is the Law tacitly recognises the Australian
sweep-maker.

Fitzsimmons’ defeat of Maher does not stamp
the latter as a duffer. Fitz is equal to anything on the
list, for the simple reason that he i§ a big man reduced
by nature to the verge of middleweight. Were Slav in

be heavily backed.

In Melbourne, when W.G, questioned an
Umpire’s decision, and in his gentlemanly English way
insulted the unassuming Bruce with, “ 1 don’t believe
Jon,” Sheffield promptly informed him that unless he
behaved himself he’d cancel his engagement on the spot.
In the Sheffield-Grace agreement one arbitrary clause
gives Sheffield the right to pay Grace off up to date.
Which stipulation itself stamps Grace as a professional.

There is an equal, if not greater, difference in
the respective abilities of the best professional and

the champion race.

Grace was in his glory when play re-commenced
on Saturday' in the Tasmanian match. Some miscreant
having watered the wicket, W. G. refused to continue the

other man than W. G. who plays cricket as a business
would have treated the affair as rather a smart joke.

A Sydney sporting paper happened to mention
Highborn as the probable winner of the Australian Cup,
and when he won the usual trumpet was blown as to the
“tip:” “As we prophesied, Highborn was the best
horse at the weights in the race.” To talk thus, con-
sidering how Strathmore was ridden is—well, Mr. Scan-
will no doubt’give the public Ins opinion of it when fixing
the weights of Highborn and Strathmore in the Sydney
Cup. PH

Embezzlements, filicides, and other “ police
items” traceable to gambling have very much decreased
in Maoriland since the legalisation of the totaljaator,
which, by the way, is now taxed there, and the pioceeds
devoted to charitable purposes. Sir Julius Vogel made
his proposal to derive a revenue from the “ tote,” on the
suggestion of the present writer. And apropos of this,
Tub Bulletin cannot understand why the proprietary
race-clubs do not in their own interest agitate for the
introduction of the belting-machine in N.S.W. At an
ordinary Hosehill, Mooreficld, or Warwick Farm meeting
from £15,000 to £20,000 is betted. The 10 per cent,
deduction made by tire clubs—as in M.L.—would give
from £l5OO to £2OOO eacli meeting, which would enable
these clubs to quadruple their stakes and contribute
besides about £2OO a meeting to charities, without hurt-
ing themselves lit the slightest. Big stakes mean
“trying” horses and the extinction of the domination
of “Johnny Armstrong ” and of the mushroom “book.”
Then again, as the “tote” may only he used on the
course, persons wishing to have their “ bit on ” must see
the races—so the attendance is increased. It is possible
to raise thousands a year for charity in any Australian
province by legalising the “ tote.”

Messrs. Johnson, Dobson, and Robertson have
been selected to pick the N.S.W. interprcvincial eight.
Where (he funds are to come from to send a crew is a
mystery to boating men, and as the Association Regatta
does not come off this year till the 30th April, to wait till
after that event before finally picking a crew, as is usually-
done, will he out of the question. The prospects of tire
N.S.W. ’O2 crew look even gloomier than usual.
In Melbourne they sell apples by the
pound ; in Sydney by the dozen.
Sir James Prendcrgast, Chief Justice, and
just now Acting-Governor of Maoriland, arrived
at that dignity flukily. Johnston, the senior
puisne Judge, w'as head and shoulders over him
forensically, but his wife had snubbed the wife of
Sir Julius Vogel when that luminary was strug-
gling to the front, and so Johnston was passed
over.
The luck of the S.A. Advertiser (Ade-
laide) dates from the wreck of the Gothenburg on
the Barrier Reef, nearly a score of years ago.
B. de Lissa, an ex-’TISER reporter (now a Borneo
planter) was at the W'reck and telegraphed full
particulars to his old office, which thus got clean
ahead of its rival, and achieved in one act a
reputation for enterprise. The lowering of the
’Tiskii’s price to the popular penny, as against
the Register’s “tuppence,” clinched its good
fortune.
Montreal (Canada) paragraph :
An inspector said that, after long vainly trying to find
out how liquor was sold on Sundays in the French
quarters of the city, one of his men.‘whilst in a candy
store, saw a customer pass the landlord some money.
The proprietor then produced a small rubber tube from
under his vest, one end of which the man put in his
mouth, and sucked. The officer pounced oh the pro-
prietor, and a search revealed that he wore a pair of tin
corsets, with a space between the inner and outer
partitions, capable of holding over a gallon of liquor. To
this the tube was attached ; the customers, leaning over
the counter took it in their mouths, and sucked until the
proprietor thought tlifrv had had their money’s worth,
when I lie supply was turned off, the tube being put back
underneath the vest.
Good old local option !
It was the Argus people who suggested
that cabled interview with the Windsor .(Vic.)
murderer’s mother-in-law in England.
Sydney Omnibus Co. recently let a con-
tract to a Ballarat firm for the supply of 2400 tons
of chaff—sufficient for one year’s consumption.
We forgive the English newspaper-man
who spoke of the N.S.W. ex-Premier as “Sir
Joseph ” Parkes. It was a most natural error.
A certain Sydney “banker,” who has just
gone where the woodbine twineth, used to boast
that he started his little cyclorama with just £lllB
capital.
“ If the officers iff the British army hired
cabs to visit the guards as they d-id in N.S.W.,
he ventured to say that they would be cashiered.”
O'Sullivan, M.P.
A Sydney paper speaks of Salmon Wilson
—now just GO years of age—as “ the Australian
millionaire.” We don’t know so much about that.
We are only sure that Salmon is a podgy groveller
with ginger whiskers,
A Melbourne paper published portraits of
the Windsor murderer and the “ successful detec-
tives.” The result was decidedly uncomplimen-
tary to the two “traps.”
The alleged Windsor murderer’s going-to-
be Bathurst sister-in-law; “I do not think my
sister loved him. . . She was willing to marry
him, as what girl would not he! He was a man in
every sense of the word ; a manly man, a perfect
gentleman, and he offered her a good position.
, . . It was but natural that she should accept
so attractive an offer, even though she didn’t
love him, and though, as a matter of fact, she
had received shortly before an offer of marriage
from a gentleman she really did want to marry in
Brisbane.”—Extracted from a Bathurst press
interviewer’s report; the italics are ours. But
we have read it all before—in Balzac.
Somebody up North sends us again the
old, old story about the new churn who put up at
a country pub, and wore a lot of glittering gems
cn his fore leg, and got his crested correspondence
presented to him on a tray by the rouseabout, and
was generally understood to be something incog.
Then he decided, as usual, to buy a station, and
the proprietor thereof drove him round in a
buggy, and liquored him, and introduced him to
his daughters, and lent him .£5 till he could
“wire to his bankers,’’and next morning his room
was empty and the publican was raving about an
unpaid bill and a garish portmanteau with a
boulder in it. Same old story all through.
A new race of troglodytes is growing up
along the Darling, (N.S.W.) —a race that camps
in holes or underneath trees, and lives miserably
on fish and rabbits and anything that happens to
drift down the river. These are in part the
unemployed of Sydney— the men who were sent
out by the Labour Bureau on free passes, and who,
being unable to walk back, vs ill probably camp
wretchedly by the Darling until they relapse into
barbarism and begin to go naked and to run after
’possums: the rest of them are mostly men who
were sacked to make room for the cheap Labour
Bureau crowd from the metropolis. Still the
unemployed keep decreasing in Sydney, and that
is probably all that the Bureau was created for.
Dear Bulletin, —Are you fully aware of
the awful truth! n your observation in last week’s
leader that “the rich (“at Home”) were able to
lend out at interest the money which should have
bought tables and chairs for the poor,” or that
many of the poor—in Ireland, at least—are without
tables and chairs? 1 remember how, in my young
school-days, when enjoying the hospitality of a
youth named Cody, we used to squat on the floor
and eat potatoes piled upon an old door which
was unhinged and laid low for the occasion under
the roof of a mud cabin in the shade of one of
the wild hills of Tipperary. Cody was sent to
America; I to a priestly college—afterwards to
drift to Australia. Macliae's etching in “Brunt's
Rdiques ” representing the “ boys ” playing cauls
on a coffin “ the night before Lany was.stretched ”
might have been sketched from life. The coffin
comes in very handily on cold nights when it
would bo uncomfortable to take down the door,
as many can tell you who, like myself, have come
from poor, poverty-stricken Ireland.—Yours, B.
Old Ireland’s wherever
Her sons may endeavour,
No matter the land we were born in.
So, strike up, my jew'l, and
Hurroo for Home Rule and
St. Patrick’s Day in the morning.

(FOR THE BULLETIN.)
Leprosy entailed a hideous excommunica-
tion in the ancient times of the HebreWs, a social
ostracism that made its victim an unconditionally
prohibited pariah, on whom had fallen the curse
of heaven and the still more cruel ban of man.
Now-a-days, with the prevalence of juster and
more humane ideas, leprosy, in Australian com-
munities at all events, is tenderly dealt with, and
means, at its worst, a comparatively luxurious
quarantine tempered with the indulgences that
pity prescribes to each death-doomed life-recluse.
Beyond having proved the bacillary nature of
leprosy, physicians know absolutely nothing about
it except that the condition of a leper may be
palliated. Inthepresentstateof medicalknowledge,
leprosy is incurable. Members of the facultydispute
even as to whether it is contagious. The microbe
has been isolated, but all efforts to “cultivate”
it, or keep it alive for any decent period of time,
nave failed. According to the late Morell
Mackenzie, “ the number of lepers now dying by
mches throughout the world must be reckoned by
millions.” Leprosy is a strange, old, fossil disease
uterly unlike any other known to science—a
prehistoric complaint that has remained over
rom antediluvian days, like one stray mammoth
ett to wander the earth alone when all the rest
are dead.
Hitherto, leprosy has been classed as a disease
most exclusively confined to Chinamen and
man coolies. It is high time to spring a fresh
arm when it is discovered that Australian
«ati Ve whites—natives, too, who have never left
amongst our lepers.

Arts ” °T S °’ facetiously styled the “ School of
inside the lep^r outages stand just
the f act . P lO !’ th( ' r . s,x are ranged along
a slight elevation ODDOsite. In tho
hollow between is seen a luxuriant melon-patch,
while away to the left is a vegetable garden.
Two lepers are gardening in the distance,
and by no means doing a lazy stroke. Flowers
bloom gaily in the little patches of flower-garden
in front of each cottage across the hollow. On
the place itself is impressed no Mosaic sign what-
ever of a “fretting leprosy.”
* * #
Entering the cottage near the gate, and
to the left, it is found to accommodate three
lepers, It is halved off, and the plan consists (in
each half) of a front sitting-room and a back bed-
room—one of the latter containing two beds.
Everything is scrupulously, even painfully, clean.
A big-nosed, swollen-lipped, face-punctured
man is in the first sitting-room, doing some fancy-
work of ornamentation to the window. He just
turns his head and nods, and then proceeds again
lethargically with his task. I have seen him
before—in a pantomime. I feel sure the super’s
mask-makers get their models from lazarets. I
thought this poor, handsomely-hideous patient
was a Chinee, so distorted were his features. I
was wrong. He is a N.S.W. native, and has
never been out of the province. He has been a
carrier, a shearer, a fencer, a mail-coach driver, a
bush-carpenter—in fact, anything and everything.
He has been married, and his wife bore him one*
child, who lived for a few hours. He had his
headquarters at Walgett for nine years, and at
Moree for seven years. At a shearing time ho
stabbed the base of the left thumb with the
shears, and three weeks afterwards noticed that
the whole of his left-hand was numb. Later, he
found himself liable to injure that hand without
feeling any pain ; in this manner, he burnt the
thumb deeply with a soldering-iron, and the little
finger with a lighted cigar, discovering these facts
otherwise than by a sensation of pain. About
five years later, he ran a nail into the sole of the
left foot, and the wound ulcerated, being scarcely
yet (nearly three years later) healed. The foot
swelled and remained swollen. His left hand and
forearm lost sensation, until one night, when a
burning log rolled out of his camp-fire against
that arm, he knew nothing of it until the
upper arm began to burn. Two years aeo,
he was much exposed to floods and wet; he caught
cold and has been hoarse ever since. The right
foot next began swelling, and later the hands.
About eleven months ago his face began to distort
itself, until now his nose is so swollen as to
entirely hide its oriffyial shape ; both cheeks are
thickened, one more than the other, giving the
mask a lopsided cant; the whole being a curious
colour-blend of brown, red, and blue. His is
tubercular leprosy.
Such is the first acknowledged leper I ever
gazed upon. There is nothing in Ids known his-
tory to indicate that he was more intimate with
Chinese than the general run of bushmen. For
eight months of last year he earned his living by
catching fish—leprosy is believed by some doctors
to be connected with, or to be at leaQt sympathetic
with, a fish diet—but that was patently long after
the disease was well established in him. He was
admitted to the Leper Hospital in December last.
On the table of the sitting-room which he ap-
parently shares with another, but invisible,
patient—most of the lepers vanish mysteriously
into recesses on the intrusion of an unknown
visitor—are some books. The title of the top one
stares at me boldly ; it is—“ The Ghouls of Gal-
veston : or, Deadwood Dick, junr., in Texas.”
Even a leper can, in imagination, perform deeds
nf fire blood, heroism —and Love !
An easy-chair is disposed on the verandah, and
the whole cottage has an air of comfort about it
that constantly lulls one into a careless frame of
mind, but this must be guarded against, lest one
absent-mindedly take up a book, touch a bed
stead, or wall, or anything consecrated to leprosy'
* » #
Crossing the hollow, cucumbers galore are
seen to be rotting in the weather. Their crop has
been too prolific this year. Huge watermelons
sprawl around every where, giving no sign of their
leprous environment.
A Chinese leper suffering from the mutilating
form of the disease consents to show me his hands,
the finger-joints of which are slowly disappearing,
while the hands themselves are paralysed and
permanently flexed, the patient being unable to
straighten out his fingers. He says nothing in
answer to questions, but stands dumbly exhibiting
his paws, and trots away out of sight so soon as he
gets a chance to do so.
* * #
Here is a boy leper, a native of Balmain,
Sydney, not yet 1G years of age. He, too, is
suffering from the mutilating form of leprosy. His
fingers are hopelessly flexed on to the palm,
though, with assistance, the first two fingers on
each hand can be extended out at right-angles
with the palms, the other fingers remaining
paralysed. Plis face is slightly swollen and of a
reddish brown colour, witli a weak redness around
the eyes and an apparent absence of eyelashes.
His father and mother were both Australian
natives; his grandmother on the father’s side was
also a native, her husband having been English.
The grandparents on the mother’s side were Irish.
The patient was one of nine children. Phthisis
and bronchitis seem to affect most of the family
and one is wasting away. This one always lived
in some Sydney suburb, with the exception of a
short period during which he visited Melbourne.
His father owned a little property, and drank
himself into a lunatic asylum, where he is still
confined. His mother, now aged over 50 years,
enjoys good health. The family habitually bought
vegetables from Chinese, but had no other special
communications with the pigtail-wearers. The
patient attended a State school from the usual
age. He slept with his mother, because he was
afraid o f the dark. He was fond of fishing and of
fish. His mother, still robust and healthy, for a
long time habitually dressed his sores.
When this youth was 12 years old, he acquired
some water-blisters on his left hand ; these broke
and left small ulcers, by which he lost two finger-
nails ; the ulcers healed, but contraction of the
fore and middle fingers followed, after which there
set in a wasting of the forearm, and his fingers
cracked. The following year his left heel
hardened and secreted offensive matter, and body
symptoms followed each other with great rapidity.
He has grown three or four inches since he has
been in the lazaret. He declares that ho hasn’t
the slightest idea as to how he first became
diseased.
# • #
Turning into “The School of Arts,” it is
found to have been hastily deserted. Even the
attractions of a half-played game of dominoes
were not sufficient to counteract the scare of an
unknown visitor. The “ School of Arts ”is a big
apartment, furnished with two long tables, a
proscenium curtain for private theatricals, and
cheerful pictures on the walls. At the back are
three big baths, with hot and cold water connec-
tions : six lavatory basins, &c.; large common
wash-house possessing a monster washing machine,
&0., &c. The ‘ School of Arts ” is the recreation
room of the lepers. Half-a-dozen of them were
here but a moment ago, but they vanished like
spooks out at the back as we came in at the front.
# # #
Another mutilated Chinaman is prevailed
upon to display his hideous hands. The fingers on
both are missing—they have rotted off mysteriously
right to the stumps, only about half-an-inch of
each stump being left on the swollen, soft, dark-
brown, puffy hands. A curious fact is that,
though the flesh and bone and all of the fingers
have dropped off, the half-inch of each stump still
bears fragments of bastard finger-nail, as if the
disease, while eating up the fingers, had drawn
the nails right up to the knuckles.
Another Chinaman exhibits a tubercular con-
dition of the face, which, all puffed and blotched
as it is, with thickened and broadened nose and
swollen eyes, and distorted neck, gives him that
kind of leonine appearance which satirical carica-
turists attribute to John Bull. In addition to
this general aspect, he has one eye almost closed,
blubber lips, and thick lumps under the ears,
while a decorative plaster of scabs shields his
spread-out nose.
A good-looking, black-haired, smart young
Chinaman reveals to a non-professional observer
little or nothing of his leprotic condition ; but his
hands are going and he is seen to be stiff and
cramped below the knees.
Now comes a Mongolian horror of the knobby
variety. His face could give a twisted apple-tree-
bough points for knobbiness. The rich brown
skin stands out in hard clusters like groups of
walnuts ; eye-surroundings puffed, with bloodshot
balls; lips thickened and swollen like the fanciful
style of a burnt-cork minstrel; not a flat, smooth
spot on the whole of the countenance; nose
broadened and twisted with horribly gaping
nostrils —and, yet, an undefinable glint of merri-
ness undercurrent of all! Yes, he was all right, he
had no pain, he was never so comfortably off in his
life, he might as well die by leprosy’s slow stages
as of any swifter complaint.
“ How long you been sick ?”
“Befo’”—slowly counting off on his dropsical
fingers—“befo’ one, two, tlee —’um—befo’ ten
moon.”
“ He means that he has been 10 months here,”
explained the medical superintendent. “He
must have been leprotic about a couple of years.”
“ You like go China again ?”
“Yes; go China by-’n-bye.”
“You go fishing?”
“Yes, plenty catchy fish sometimes.”
The Government supply these poor wretches
with hooks and lines and they are allowed to fish
along a certain distance of the shore—rocks chiefly
• —the boundary-lines being marked by rigged-up
ropes.
“ Plenty good flower gardens?”
“Yes, plentee cabbagee, too muchee young
fellah; too muchee coocumbee, altogethee go
bad.”
“ You like this place ? ’
“ Oli, nicee place.”
And the poor knobby-faced scarecrow strode off
to his private lair.
“ Charley ” is a swell kanaka, a Tanna Islander.
His little cottage is full of nick-nacks, and owns
wall-pictures, handsomely framed, while the floor
is covered with a gaudy oil-cloth. There is a
chest of drawers, with a grand looking-glass, and
Charlie is seated on the bed in a startlingly white
shirt, stiff with starch, a masher collar, and a

gay-coloured necktie, black cloth waistcoat and
pants. He has doffed his coat on account of the
heat. Charlie is vain of his room, and if you
compliment him upon its appearance, he will love
you—for the time being. As he sits with folded
arms, one can see nothing much the matter with
him, but when he exhibits his hands, the work of
the terrible plague is visible. Again, the fingers
self-corroded down to stumps ; and again the nails
growing only an inch from the main knuckles of
the hand. Doctors don’t attempt to explain this
phenomenon.
Charlie has a green-painted stand for flowerpots
out on his verandah, which is reached by a flight
of steps ; also a model —three feet or so—of a line-
of-battle ship ; and is, in Lis way, as happy as a
king. His present great grief is—“ Too much
sea-breeze longa flowers there; die, all die, longa
wind.”
There are other male lepers, whites and Chinese,
but they have retreated to their private apart-
ments, or are concealed around the grounds.
* # #
All of the white lepers are believed to be
natives of N.S.W. One man, who belonged to a
family of seven, is now about 31 years of age.
After his school-years, lie was one year with a
cordial-maker, after which he helped his mother,
who kept a restaurant, his especial duty being to
buy vegetables in tbc markets —frequently from
Chinese.
The exact period when he absorbed the leprotic
germs is untraceable. At 17 he became a carter,
and shortly afterwards began to learn plastering,
his first work being to beat up bullock’s-hair and
mortar with a trowel. When getting on for 20,
the trowel broke the skin over the outer side of
the right fore-finger, which swelled and has never
since recovered its natural size or appearance.
Anaesthesia of hands and feet set in, and he would
frequently burn or injure these limbs without
feeling it. When about 24, he had an attack des-
cribed as erysipelas and rheumatic fever, from
which followed general swelling and distortion of
his hands and feet. Two years later his eyes
became diseased and he almost lost his sight.
In ’BB, he tried to cut his throat. In August of
that year he was admitted- to the lazaret. His
father died insane in Gladesville Asylum,
* # #
A youth of 19 years is a native of the
Mudgee district, N.S.W. His father was also
native-born, of Irish descent ; his mother was
born at sea, of English parents. Both are still
living and in good health, and to them were born
nine other children, all of whom are in the best of
condition. The family has always lived on the
Meroo—an old goldfield continuously haunted by
Chinese, but the intercourse between the family
and the Chinkies was restricted to purchases of
tea and sugar, and sometimes of boots from a
Chinese storekeeper. Fish was a rare article of
diet with this patient, who, until 13 years old,
was well, strong, intelligent and active. Then,
the fingers of the left hand began to contract, and
the muscles of the forearm to waste; blebs appeared
on the fingers, and loss of sensation followed. At
15, reddish-brown and pure brown spots appeared
on the trunk ; the right hand and right foot con-
tracted and swelled; and at 16, the face gob
discoloured and began to swell and become dis-
figured. There is no clue to the date and manner
of his first absorption of the leprotic virus (if there
be such a virus).
.# . * #
A 30-year-old timber-getter, from the
.Richmond River district, with tuberculous face,
ulcerated feet, swollen hands, and other symp-
toms, dates his knowledge that he was suffering
from a progressive disease from a time, "about 3|
years ago, when a peg in the sole of a new boot
injured the surface about the root of the great toe;
an ulcer followed, which continually broke out
again, and heralded the other symptoms. In ’B7,
he helped to place a dead leper in a coffin. It was
in ’BB that he injured his toe. He lias been
married nearly ten years, and his wife has borne
him two children. His father was an Alsatian,
and his mother English. There are four others
in the family ; all healthy.
# # #
A native of Gunnedah, N.S.W., now 24
years old--whose chief occupations were fencing,
shearing, and droving, who never had special
communication with Chinese or other Asiatics,
who is not fond of fish and has had only rare
opportunities of eating it fresh, while he has
seldom used the canned or salted article —has his
face and ears distorted shockingly with tubercular
leprosy, while his body is brown-spotted, bis
hands and feet swollen and discoloured. He dates
his symptoms from ’B4, when he had a whitlow,
and lost a joint of the right index-finger.
# * *
Outside the enclosure, away up on the
hill, in a snug little isolated cottage, reside the
two female lepers. Each has a cosy sitting-room
and a bedroom, and there is an easy lounge and
an easy chair on the verandah, where we find
both patients resting themselves. One lies on the
lounge, with her once evidently pleasant face
swollen and discoloured into a strong contrast with
her iron-grey hair; her hands and feet, too, are
badly swollen. She is a widow, 53 years of age,
and has borne six children. Her husband was
accidentally killed in ’7O. To support her children,
she traded in haberdashery in a small way. She
habitually dealt with Chinese for vegetables, but
never had closer communication with them or
with other Asiatics. She does not remember ever
having seen another leper previous to her entry
into the lazaret. She was never fond of fish. She
-has only been a few weeks at Little Bay.
The veiled lady in the easy chair is unmarried,
and aged 34 years. Her case is heroic. She
nursed a younger brother through years of leprosy
and saw him deposited in the grave in ’B9. About
’B3, this lady had a sore heel, attributed to the
pressure of a tight boot, but after three weeks the
place healed perfectly. Next year, discoloured
spots were seen on the legs, and red spots on the
face; later, brown, or reddish-brown spots and
patches on the body ; in ’B7 she lost her eyebrows;
in ’B9, her voice became affected, and it is now
confined to a whisper. Her state is tuberculous
and anaesthetic. She has been at Little Bay about
a year, now.
The origin of her brother’s disease is not known.
He was a manly fellow, sft. llin. in height, but
of a weakly constitution, and seems to have
suffered ill-health from boyhood upwards. Their
father and mother were both natives of Ireland ;
Srand parents —Scotch on the father’s side and
Inglish on the mother’s. The leper was the
youngest son of seven living. He was born
in ’6l at Campbelltown (N.S.W.), where he
lived till ’6B; he then resided in Sydney till ’7O;
in Adelaide (S.A.) till ’BO, when he returned to
Sydney, where he died in ’B9.
* * *
Here, then, in an enclosed and cultivated
area embracing a little over two and a quarter
acres, the afflicted lepers known to the N.S.W*
Health authorities doze out their monotonous
existence, softened and cheered by the modern
conveniences necessary to comfort and cleanliness,
and treated, after a fashion, as pets. In addition
to many papers and periodicals provided by
Government, the lazaret receives frequent contri-
butions of reading matter. The Chinese lepers, of
course, must content themselves with looking at
the pictures.
There are 21 lepers at present in the lazaret—l9
men and two women. The nationalities arc as
follows Chinese, 11 ; N.S.W. natives, 8 ;
Javanee, 1 ; South Sea Islander, 1. On Ist
January, ’9l, the tally was 13 8 Chinese, 4
N.S.W., 1 Javanee, One Chinaman and one
N.S. Welshman died during the year. Live
N.S.W. natives, four Chinese, and one South Sea
Islander were admitted during the year —a total
of 10 out of 17 eases suspected of leprosy.
Since the establishment of tin l lazaret in ’B3,
there have been 31 patients admitted Chinese,
19 (8 died) ; natives of N.S.W., 9 (1 died) ; and 1
half-caste West Indian (discharged with healed
sores in ’BS, there being then no law in existence
to warrant his detention); one Javanee, and one
Kanaka.
After much trouble and many representations to
the late Farkes Government, the latter was induced
to pass a Leprosy Act in November, ’9O, which gave
the sanitary authorities full powers to deal with
lepers and suspected lepers, and made it incum-
bent on all medical men, under a penalty of “ not
less than .£lO nor more than to report sus-
pected cases to the authorities without delay. It
is to the operation of this Act that the compara-
tively large number of suspects examined last year
is due.
Two wardsmen look after the lepers. The head
wardsman, who has been a soldier, though still
young and active man, has had considerable ex-
perience in field hospitals and dispensaries, and
handles the lepers fearlessly, seeming to be quite
at home in his repulsive tasks. The best dis-
infectant against leprosy is held to be corrosive
sublimate ; carbolic acid and other approved dis-
infectants are inert, unless they are made of such
concentrated strength that, they could not be
personally handled. The corrosive sublimate is
found to be effective in the proportion of 1 part
in 1000,
# * *
Of the South Coast Hospital itself, I do
not intend to say much. It is the great sewer of
the infectious diseases of Sydney. All cases of
erysipelas, measles, scarlet fever, diphtheria,
chicken-pox, whooping-cough, typhoid fever, &c.,
have to be reported to the authorities; the
Medical Board of Health telephones at once to
Little Bay, and off starts an ambulance to the
locality named. There are four ambulances, but
not one specially reserved for lepers ! When an
ambulance is used for the conveyance of any
leper, it is carefully disinfected with sulphur and
corrosive sublimate.
The medical superintendent, to whom thanks is
due for courtesies tendered, is Dr. W. Peirce, a
reserved, hermit-like sort of man, wrapped up in
scientific breedings, and whose special forte is
said to be the treatment of typhoid fever. I
gathered by hint rather than by avowal that Dr,
I’oirce does not rely much on the hydropathic, or
“ wet-pack ” system of cure. He has super-
intended Little Bay for six years.
* * *
The moral of a visit is that, though the
immediate leprotic inoculation of whites is almost
invariably obscure, seeing that the insidious
disease often takes years to incubate—lies hidden
until a scratch or a bruise calls forth its venomous
powers—leprosy is a curse that entered Australia
with the Chinaman. Its discovery upon white's
should furnish another reason why the yellow
man should bo banished to Lis own leprous laud
Heaven knows how many whites now-a-days are
mixing with their Australian fellows freely,
having the seeds of leprosy latent in their blood
It is possible that a man of strong vitality might
bo a medium of transmission to others, and yet
never disclose the disease on himself to himself
This last is my own speculation, unsupported bv
mooted theories, and with it I bad better clm£
the chapter. e

Jim’s Whip.
(FOR THE BULLETIN.)
Yes, there it hangs upon the wall
And never gives a sound,
The hand that trimmed its greenhidc fall
Is hidden underground,
There, in that patch of sallee shade,
Beneath that grassy mound.
I never take it from the wall,
That whip belonged to him.
The man I singled from them all,
He was my husband, Jim ;
I see him now, so straight and tall,
>So long and lithe of limb.
That whip was with him night and day
When he was on the track ;
I’ve often heard him laugh, and say
That when they heard its crack,
After the breaking of the drought,
1 he cattle all came back.*
And all the time that Jim was here,
A-working on the run,
I’d hear that whip ring sharp and clear
Just about set of sun,
To let me know that he was near
And that his work was done.
I was away that afternoon,
Penning the calves, when, bang !
I heard his whip, ’twas rather soon—
A thousand echoes rang
And died away among the hills,
As toward the hut I sprang.
I made the tea and waited, but,
Seized by a sudden whim,
I went and sat outside the hut
Watching the light grow dim—
I waited there till after dark,
But not a sign of Jim.
The evening air was damp with dew ;
Just as the clock struck ten
His horse came riderless—l knew
What was the matter then.
M by should the Lord have singled out
My Jim from other men ?
I took the horse and found him, where
He lay beneath the sky,
With blood all clotted on his hair ;
I felt too dazed to cry—-
I held him to me as I prayed
To God that I might die.
But sometimes now I seeni to hear
Just when the air grows chill
A single whip-crack, sharp and clear,-
Re-echo from the hill,
J hat s Jim, to let me know he’s neat
And thinking of me still.

( Dear Bulletin, — \our correspondent
G.J.S. having' dragged my name into Ids com-
munication on Wetere te Rerenga in this week’s
issue of The Bulletin, permit me to say that
“G.J;S.”Is wrong in most of his facts, that heriefeer
saw or conversed with Te Rerenga, and that he
Was never in the Ngatimaniapoto Country in his
life. Te Rerenga, although a bully, a coward ard
a murderer, was never a cannibal (Kai tangata
Maori), an eye-swallower or a Halt Hau. He was
certainly in anils against us in the old Waitara
campaign, but for years before, and after, he was
a peaceful trader, and commanded Ids own little
schooner, the Parahanini, which ran regularly
between Kawhia and Taranaki with fruit and
potatoes; “ G.J.S.” asserts that Te Rerenga, or
NV etete, as he was known in those days, murdered
my grandfather, the Rev; John Whiteley, and
drank his blood. The first statement I believe
to bo untrue, although as leader of the
tana or war-party lie was morally the
murderer, and as such would have paid the
penalty for his crime on two occasions, but that
he was assisted by the Native Ministers of the
time to escape the vengeance of relatives and the
provisions of the law. The second statement is a
lib 1 know you approve of plain speaking—con-
ceived in the worst possible, taste and published in
the interests of mere newspaper sensationalism.
My grandfather was shot (as I believe, by a
European)! the other victims of the White Cliffs
affair, including a young mother and her little
children, were savagely slain with a tomahawk.
“G.J.S.” exhibits his ignorance of Maoriland
history by stating that in 1884 he met Wetere,
who “had then been under, the ban of outlawry
for 20 years.” Te Wetere was proclaimed an out-
law in 1860 for the White Cliffs affair, was par-
doned by Sir Donald M’Lean in 1875, met Sir
George Grey at Waitara in 1878, and had been a
frequent visitor to Auckland since that date, so
that this imaginary . conversation between
“G.J.S.” and an outlawed murderer in 1884 is
also mere bunkum. . Wetere’s “numerous and
valorous henchmen ” are the mere creatures of
“G.J.S.’s” imagination, and his “inaccessible”
fortress could have been stormed and taken by ten
men of the N.Z.A.C. any day. Ac the time of
the massacre, Colonel (now General Sir George)
Whitmore could have wiped the Ngatimaniapoto
off the .face of the earth if lie had been allowed a
free hand by the Government of the day; but it was
ever the policy of New Zealand Ministers to allow
native murderers to escape. Finally “G.J.S.’s”
tales of “ Wesley, the Snag,” besides being at
variance with historical fact, are palpably the
inventions of a wretched penny-a-liner, who, in
order to trade off his wretched production under
the guise of personal reminiscences, has libelled a
dead savage. And I rise to defend that dead
savage because, although lie was, after his contact
with civilisation, a coward, a bully, and a mur-
derer, there was still something manly in his
character, and Wetere Te Rerenga was not the
idiotic blasphemer that “G.J.S.” has painted
him. -Yours, (fee., Whiteley King. Sydney,
•>th March, 1802. [This sort of thing makes us
feel better. We like to see the old, dreary Maori
tearing each other’s hair over their

The N.8.W. Free Lending-Library costs

buy it and give it him.”

| Dear Bulletin, — Concerning your recent
| paragraph re heights of Kosciusko and adjacent
j peak : having just completed a survey of this part
i of the Snowy Mountain Range, during winch the
position and relative heights of the various peaks
[ were accurately determined, I am in a position to
state as follows : —Mount Kosciusko, a smooth,
grassy, round-topped hill, on which a trig, station
has lately been erected, is the highest. Muellers
Peak, a mound of huge granite rocks, on which ;i
cairn was erected many years ago, is the second in
height. From the inscription, &c., left by
visitors on this cairn, it is evident that the peak
has frequently been mistaken for Kosciusko. It is
licit, lioH'evel’, situated on the instill rahge, tint on a
ppnr running towards the Murray. Moililt Twy-
wiw: aiiother glassy hill, is the third in height.
Iherg is only a difference Of about 40ft. between
the highest and lowest of these three. Mounts
Kosciusko and Tdwnsolid ale identical, the latter
name having been given by Dr. Von Loildenfeld
who, standing oil Mueller s Peak, which he sup-
posed td be Kosciusko, discovered a higher point
and naitled it as before stated—Yours, W. h’

don t believe there is a word of truth in it."
I hat’s the way certain foolish people talk when
they hear of anything unusual, or outside the
limits of their own observation or experience
I hey are of the sort who laughed at Stephenson
when he introduced the railway, and at Morse
when he said that we could communicate by means
of electricity Yet they don’t laugh at those
things now. They make use of them daily.
Some months ago the case of Mrs. Mary Cudrb,
was first published. The great public accented
the facts, as they had every reason to do. Others
a very few (professional men perhaps) pretended
to doubt, and sent emissaries to inquire bf tho
lady herself whether her allegations had hot been
added to, or altered, for the sake of popular effect
Here is her answer! She repeats what she at
hrst said, and puts a quietus on all who called
her words in question. It will be observed that
her statement is as plain and solemn as language
can make it. 6
[copy.]
■*■’ Mary Cuddy, of 28, Catherine Street, Rich-
mond Road, Leeds, do solemnly and sincerely
declare as follows y
Ever since I was a girl I have suffered from ill
ness. I always had a pain both before and after
eating, and never seemed able to gain and keen
my strength, and felt that something was pullinl
me down. I had a nasty queer feeling in mv
stomach. Sometimes food seemed to ease it and
it other times it made me feel worse, and often I
went without food, for I was afraid to eat. Com
monly when food was placed before me I could not
touch it, and I often fainted at tho very sight of it
After a while I became so weak I could scarcely
stand or walk. I thought it was consumption
coming on by degrees and I took all sorts of
medicines to try and get relief, but it was of no use
and I got tired of taking physic, for I had lost all
taitli in it. My business was so urgent that I was
compelled to be at work, otherwise I would have
laid m bed, so weak had I become. With the
weakness and loss of appetite there were other
feelings and signs that were bad and alarmed me
greatly. Among them were these A yellowish
colour of the skin and eyes, sometimes a cold
clammy perspiration, pains and aches in the sides’
the chest and back, headache, a kind of wind or gas
coming up into my throat and mouth that was so
sour and sicketlihg I could scarcely bear it, Once in
a while I Would have a strange fluttering and pal-
pitation that made hie think my heart must bo
affected; My heart Would thump so that 1 feared
it would jump out of its place, and I have had to
walk about the room for two or three hours at a
time, for I Could not sit or lie; The pain was so
severe that I have asked my hUsbahd if he could
not heal- my heart thumping as 1 walked about.
I always slept badly at night, and frequently had
horrible dreams, and was so melancholy and
depressed in spirits that 1 Wotlld sit down add
cry, for I got no pleasure as time dragged wearily
by - 1 •'ad so little energy or strength that it was
all 1 could do to summon Courage for the labour
upon which the family (at least in part) depended
for support; I am a dressmaker, and it will be
easily understood how hard my life was, for 1
didn t think it would last much longer; Not long
ago (May, 1887) I made up my mind to try a
medicine that is advertised and known all over
the country. I mean Mother Seigel’s Curative
Syrup. I had no faith in it at first, for how cah
one believe in What one knows nothing about? I
bought and tried Mother Seigel’s Curative Syrup
only because of its reputation. How could so
many people, I asked myself, praise a medicine so
much if it had no virtue? 1 can only say that 1
found what they said to be true. After beginning
with the Syrup, relief soon followed; My food
digested better and gave me strength, and by
persevering with it all my pains disappeared; 1
could eat my food with a relish, and everything
agreed with me. Now and again when, through
confinement and hard work, 1 feel a touch of my
old complaint I take a dose or two of Seigel’s
>Syi up and the trouble goes no further. Since the
publication of my testimonial many persons have
called at my house and asked me if all that is pub-
lished about my ease is true, and if the Proprietors
of Seigel’s Syrup had made additions to my state-
ment.
I told them all that every word was true and
nothing had been added by the Proprietors of the
medicine, but I could add a good deal more, for no
words can describe what my sufferings were
during all those long years. I never expected
being well again in this world. Seigel’s Syrup
saved my life and I desire other sufferers to know
of what did so much for me. I will gladly answer
inquiries.
And I make this solemn declaration con-
scientiously believing the same to be true, by
virtue of the provisions of the Statutory Declara-
tion Act (Will. IV., c. 62.)
_ , , , , (Signed) Mary Cuddy.
Declared before me at Leeds, in the '
County of York, by the said Mary
Cuddy, on Monday, the 10th day of
August, 1891.
(Signed) Alb\ Cooke,
Mayor of Leeds. ,
Not a syllable further is needed except to say
that her ailment, indigestion and dyspepsia,
burdens and saddens the lives of many other
women (and men also), who will read with new
hope the outcome of Mrs. Cuddy’s case, and place
a confidence which no cavilling can shake, in the
remedy which restored to her the health and
happiness that Providence designs for us all.
