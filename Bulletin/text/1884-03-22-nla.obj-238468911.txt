SATURDAY, MARCH 33, 1884.
In the old country, the social fact that most
strikes the philosophical observer is the
mass of want and pauperism and ignorance
that exists side by side of wealth beyond the
dreams of avarice, aud princely endowments
for charitable and educational and civilising
purposes. Probably no country in the world
ever possessed such means as England pos-
sesses for the relief of poverty and the teach-
ing of ignorance. Unfortunately, but a
small fractional portion of those endowed
means are devoted to the objects to which
they were originally devoted. The vast
wealth of the Established Church, which
should mainly be expended on the relief of
physical distress, is practically devoted to
the maintenance of an hierarchical class,
whose mission it is to preach a false peace to
the well-to-do and a base content to the
ill-to-do—
“ Prophets who smile Peace, Peace, when it is a
sword;
Sages who shut their eyes when Truth Is stern to
behold;
Preachers who preach the life of what they must
feel to be death.”
And, not content with evasion of duty by
omission to deal righteously with the vast
wealth entrusted to them on behalf of the
poor and the ignorant, the clergy of the
Church of England, as a body, go out of
their way to still further evade their duty
by the commission of the sin of seducing the
rich to give of their abundance to the mul-
tiplying of churches over the land — to
give to poverty and ignorance, not the
bread of material benefit, but the carven
stone of a gothic edifice that once a week
for a few hours shall be open for the solemn
farce of the religious worship of such miser-
able sinners as have clothes to wear and at
least a threepenny-bit to put iu the inevit-
able plate. In London, for instance, while
hospital accommodation for the poor is daily
proving less and less equal to keep pace with
the demands made upon It, the Lord Bishop
of Rochester, in whose dioeese is a consider-
able portion of South London, has quite
recently been successful in collecting £43,350
towards the erection of more churches,
altbough the existing ones are when open
never half full. That sum spent on the phy-
sical necessities of the poor and afflicted
would do Christ’s work among them—would
help to feed them, to heal them, epentupon
the spiritual requirements of the diocese,
what is it but sending the ruffles when want-
ing the shirt? Not only in London, but all
over England, the cry of the clergy, headed
by their Right Reverend Fathers in God, is
for “church extension a very selfish cry
on their part, when one analyses it, since
what else does it moan but the further en-
richment of their caste: more patronage for
bishops, a greater number of more comfort-
able livings for the Levitieal rank and file ?
If proof were wanting of the fact that
Anglican bishops were wearing themselves
out in this holy cause, it would be afforded
hy the circumstance that several prelates
were forced to Reviera during the late
season, there to recruit their exhausted
energies after their heroic exertions on
behalf of—their cloth.

Another British institution seised of im-
mense endowments for educational and
charitable purposes is the City of London
Guilds. There are many Guilds. Their total
income i* £750,000 a year. Of that largo
total they can dispose at pleasure of some
£550,000. And it is their pleasure to spend
£185,000 thereof on sheer guzzling and gorg-
ing, £336,000 thereof on Guild members and
their friends, and the balance (a poor half-
penny worth of bread to this intolerable
deal of sack) on education and miscellaneous
charities 1 What the Church of England is
doing in tho way of endeavouring to increase
her own prestige at the expense of the work-
ing classes and the outcast poor—what the
City of London Guilds are doing in more
direct evasion of their duties and responsi-
bilities—is but a type of the invariable opera-
tion of privilege and caste—the result of
such operation being that accursed state of
things against which earnest Liberalism is
called upon to fight with might and main.
The pauper masses in ‘ Christian England,
where they cant of a Saviour’s name” (to
quote the words of an Anglican canon)
have long lain stripped and sore wounded,
Priest and Levite (not without suspicion
of their being in league with the rob-
bers who waylaid them) having been
passing and re-passing by these years
and years, doing nothing, offering no-
thing beyond such hypocritical apothegms
as “all is for the best,” “the Lo«d loveth
whom he chasleneth,” “poverty is an ex-
ceeding blessing if submissively borne ” (by
somebody else). Luckily for the down-
trodden poor, the cry.is now “Radicalism to
the rescue! ” aud there are not wanting signs
that a great social struggle is about to begin,
the throes whereof will rock England to her
foundations. In the old country, the battle
that Radicalism has to wage is one to re-win
rights of which the masses have been de-
liberately and systematically despoiled by
the privileged classes. In this new country,
Radicalism has also got its work to do; not
to re-win manhood’s rights, but to ward off
from them the attacks which threaten them
from many quarters. Although out here
there is—thank Goodness I —no established
Church, yet there is evinced, on the part of
the clergy of nearly all denominations,
a mischievous and dangerous desire to
seduce the well-to-do into the mammon
worship of useless Church building, as
well as a persistent effort to throw
the burden of teaching religious doctrine
upon the shoulders of the Public School
teacher. The Public School system only
demands in the way of attendance some
five hours a day for live days a week, for
some forty weeks in the year —a time only
barely sufficient for necessary secular in-
struction —yet the parson demands that a
portion o 2 that scant time shall be occupied
by the State-paid teacher in doing his (the
parson’s) work. If a place in the Public
School curriculum be projiosed to be found
for “conduct and morals,” unless the Deity
be dragged into the lesson, the charge o!
godlessness (deliberately meant as a charge
of infamy) is hurled by the parson at the
proposers; and a conservative journal like
the S.M. Herald backs the parson by a
statement of this kindAccepting it—(a
book on moral conduct that dees not drag in
the Deity)—the State flings itself into the
arms of an absolute Secularism; and, permit
ting'that acceptance, the clergy surrender
one of their high privileges and abandon one
of their most sacred duties.”
• • ■
And, not only against clerical intolerance,
and the conservative prejudices that endorse
it, has the local Radical to fight, but against
the evident intention of the large land-
owning classes to build up out here some-
thing as closely resembling the mock
British feudalism of to-day as possible. The
large property owners are also casting about
how they can shirk their responsibilities.
They have already quite recently shown
their animus, and their strength, too, in
their opposition to Dibbs’ property-tax pro-
posals. Unless prevented, they will shunt
the main burden of their responsibilities (as
the British large property owners have
succeeded in doing) on to the working
classes.
• • •
It is against such movements as those of
the larger property owners seeking to evade
their responsibilities, and those of the
clerical classes seeking to throw a big share
of their proper work on to the shoulders of
the Public School teachers, and to persuade
the well-to-do into subscribing towards
wholesale church extension—the while there
are no reformatories for the street arabs, no
asylums for outcast women, not sufficient
means of wholesome recreation for the
denizens stewing in the crowded slums of
the metropolis—it is against such move-
ments that Radicalism must exert all its
strength, if the essentially democratic char-
acter of the constitution of this colony is to
be saved from those who are doing their
best to contaminate it by inoculating it with
the debasing principles of Caste, Privilege,
and Monopoly.
PLAIN ENGLISH.
It is rarely the schoolmaster is let out on the dull
heavy-headed world. But ive him a show and he
makes up for his seasons of solitude. There is a
greenness still about the memory of the Mary
borough man who wrote to Minister Archer ex_
plaining why he had broken a regulation by taking
the chair at a political meeting. “ You see, sir,”
he went on, “ it is men like me, gifted with elo-
quence, rising sometimes to the very point of
genius, and commanding by my position the
confidence and homage of the community’
that tho people are justified in expecting
to come to the front on occasions unusu-
ally momentous.” Ho was right, and if his
brother dominies would come only one at a time
the world would last. But tho Victorian Board of
classifiers has brought them all out together. By
law one classifier must be appointed from the
teaching body by the votes of teachers. Mr.
Whyte, of the Training School, wants the ap-
pointment, but so do Mr. Nicholes, of Balla-
rat, and Mr. Hosking, of Sandhurst. The coun-
try teachers want a country man, and the
town teachers want a town man. If the three
go to tho poll, Mr. Whyte, the town man
is sure to win. Which of the two countrymen,
then, will retire ? Possibly, you will say, let the
less strongly supported duck under. But which is
he? Out of a total of 900 voters in tho country,
Mr. Hosking can give you documentary proof that
899 will vote straight for him, and Mr. Nicholes
can show you 899 ready to vote for him also.
Well, then, try arbitration ? Tried. Failed. Well,
then, choose an umpire. Yes, Mr. Wuixon, M.L.A.,
will do. Tried. Failed. Rev. Fitchktt will do.
Tried. Failed, We must go to Jambs Mirams. But
James knows how schoolmasters can manipulate
figures; and when he heard they were on the road
he said, “No, you don’t I” Try Mr. Balfour. “Ye
needn’t come near me,” said Mr. Balfour ; “ I
couldn’t see through it in less than a century.’
And the schoolmasters stand panting, looking
round for someone willing to be set mad,

as has been the whole course of the pro-
ceedings of our Imperial Government in relation
to the national movement of the Egyptian peopld
under the guidance of Achmet Arabi, there have
at least been compensations latterly. The English
people, after the first madness of the war fever
had passed away, have allowed justice to entej
their minds with respect to the character ana
aims of Arabi. After nearly staining the records
of their country by hanging him as a rebel, they
now admit that he was a patriot. But now a new
horror transpires. If we had small moral right to
repress the national rising in Egypt,we’ve positively
none for meddling with the Soudan. That we were
bound by the consequences of our unhappy deal-
ings with Egypt to extricate the garrisons exposed
to the fury of the resultant national rising in the
Soudan, is true. But, beyond that, what were our
duties or our rights ? The encounter with the
forces of the Mahdi’s lieutenant, Osman Diona, j
was incident to the relief of the garrisons. It was I
a hard fight, gallantly contested on both sides, and
won by valour supported with modern weapons
against, at least equal valour less formidably
armed. But now we learn that a British Admiral
and a British General have set a price upon a
patriot’s head I A more shocking, a more degrad-
ing, incident has not occurred within our
lifetime. £1000 for Osman Digna, dead or alive!
What Is this but a premium for assassination ?
When a tyrant, the oppressor of a whole people,
the enemy of human liberty, fell by the hand of
his outraged subjects, a shriek went forth against
the deed as an Inexpiable crime. Yet we, the
British nation, are made responsible for the offer
of a reward to any man who will be false to his
Country and religion and will assassinate one of the
brave leaders who is struggling in manly warfare
to preserve his country from foreign domination*
English history has not been stained with such a
record since Edward I. put a price on the head
of the Scottish patriot, William Wallace.
We will leave the foregoing to be on record. Since
it was written, we have had the news that the Gov-
ernment have disapproved of the device c*
General Graham and Admiral Hewett. Dis-
approved ! We should hope so. We were
very near hanging Arabi for trying to res-
cue his country from the unspeakable Turks
and Circassians. The General and the Admiral
would have paid English taxpayers’ money to
have Osman Digna assassinated for defending his
country. Now, w hat do these distinguished officers
deserve for betraying their country by saddling it
with the momentary responsibility of an Infamy ?
A grant of money and a peerage, probably.
The Butrowa Bench, on the 5th Inst., dealt with a
14-year old boy named Burns, who was charged
with saying to one Timothy Gavan, in the public
street, “ I know you are a bloody informer.” It
being Master Burns’ first offence, and the police
giving him a good character, he was let off with a
6s. fine (and 5s. 6d. costs of court). This “first
offence” arrangement is getting rather mono-
tonous. In a certain class of cases It may be well
to act Oh It, but such an offence as deliberately
calling a person a bloody informer surely doesn’t
come within the category. We shall next hear of
Judges exorcising, leniency to some beginner In
the homicidal line, substituting a brief imprison-
ment for the death penalty, on the ground of its
being the prisoner’s first murder.
“Justice always whirls in equal measure”—ex-
cepting when she doesn’t. At the recent Quarter
Sessions, young Bank-clerk Primrose received a
five-years’ penal servitude sentence for embezzling
£89 odd: and, at the same Court, Depul y-Reglstrar-
General Duff, for embezzling £1107 13s. 6d., was
sentenced to four years in Darlinghurst Gaol. His
Honor thought Duff’s “ good character might
weigh with him in passing sentence.” Only the
other day, however, another learned Judge de-
cided that the greater a man’s social standing
was, and the more inducements he had to avoid
crime and evil courses, the greater in proportion
should be the punishment Imposed upon him
whenever he wilfully offended against the laws.
This is precisely the theory of the great Beccaria,
who held that “ Crimes are only to be measured
by the injury done to society.” If this be sound,
it is therefore somewhat hard to see how a young
Bank lad, whose Inexperience in the world and
whoso facilities to commit crime cause him to
make a single slip, should receive five-years’
penal servitude for embezzling a few pounds,
whilst a Civil servant of thirty-one years’ standing,
and who at the time he committed his crime was
receiving a salary of £600 per annum, with, as his
Honor remarked, “ considerable emoluments,”
should receive only four years for embezzling
a thousand.

An outrage of the Waterloo and Woolloomooloo
stamp occurred in San Francisco in August last,—
one of the perpetrators, Charles Josselyn, was
convicted of the offence. The style adopted to
stamp out such brutalities may be inferred from
the Judge’s remarks, and the sentence he imposed.
On Oct. 36th., Judge Toohey said “ Leniency to
you could only seem as encouragement to other
bad men to emulate your nefarious example.
Therefore, as law has conferred upon me power
to punish crime, I intend to apply such in your
case, and in that of other like offenders, that the
moat hardened criminals will shudder at the
thought of affronting any woman-old or young,
rich or poor—within the boundaries of this city and
county. I have carefully considered this matter,
and in neither youth nor character do you show
grounds for extenuation; but in deference to the
respectful recommendation of the jury, 1 will
make your sentence much lighter than it would
be without their mediation. It is the judgment
and sentence of this Court that you be imprisoned
at San Quentin for forty years.”
TO CORRESPONDENTS.
[Correspondents who give neither name nor nom-de-
plume cannot expect to have their com-
munication noticed.]
“H.W.” (Orange): Thank you very much
for the clipping- you forward from the Orange
Advocate, but it is of no use to us, containing
wh it is known amongst ministers and deacons as
"a double one.” We wonder, by the way, if your
paper inserts pars, like that, what the Orange
Advocate advocates. We should think that the
person of the “compony,” who wishes to ‘ ex-
tend ” his stock, will fall against a boot one day.
Let’s hope (for his sake) that the toe will be a soft
one—"Staff” (Molong): It was unnecessary for
you to head your communication “ confenden-
tially,” for we can hardly make a line of it out.
You seem to want to know if editors always sign
each "Answer eorresponadance.” Of course I We
wonder a man of your perceptive powers hasn’t
discovered that before. Oh, and that reminds us.
Where did you discover the spider who taught
you your handwriting ? The best way, we think,
to remind us when you want the paper, is to send
the money for it. But strike a new tarantula, or
we shall never receive the letter, and some (per-
haps) underserving people will batten on your
wealth “W.F.H.” (office): We stand corrected.
It Is J., and not J, B., Howe who is the brother of
B. L. Fargeon. A natural error, though, when
you have got such a big knife-board to edit
“Spluttering Pen” (Gunning): You don’t mean
really to say that “ The latest fashion in Gunning
is to cut chaff for feeding horses with a pair of
rusty shears.” Fancy! You ask us to improve it.
What ? The fashion, or the pair of rusty shears ?
You might let us know at your leisure. In the
meanwhile, remember us kindly to the other
housemaid “Sequentia” (Sutton Forest): What
was the keeper doing when you got away ? How-
ever, there’s a billet for you down here. Call at
the Hum office, and say we sent you “B.

traced from Judy, You want punching. Very
in-JuDY-cious “ExNihilo” (Wellington, N.Z.):
Excellent. Just our sentiments — “ Old Staque”:
Very good, but "prison” doesn’t rhyme with
“driven,” you know — “W.Simpson” (Hobart):
Yes; absurd. Will deal with It “H.M.”: “The
Fools of Sydney” is not even doggerel: it is
puperell “F.G.A.”: We are very much obliged
to you, indeed, for your communication. But
this has seemed to escape you: No one ever does
“take the trouble to read Sir Alfred Stephen’s
speeches.” Unless they do in the kitchen—when
very hungry; or, say more than usually hungry.
Of course we mean the Soup Kitchen “H.P.”
(Glen Innes): It you found the wretched scrawl as
you say, you should have sent it to the owner, not
to us. What do we care about you and him and
your miserable wages? “Our troubles!”
“Jimmy Fenack”: Well meant, no doubt; but
won’t geo for The Bulletin. Send it to “ her.”
She’ll think it sublime. Anything about “ wild
idolatrous love” and “blotting her after life”
(which, by the way, is an admirable simile—under
the circumstances, as it likens a “wild, idolatrous”
lover to a sheet of foolscap) will fetch the average
girl. Of course we understand that “ she ” is not
an average girl. She never is, anymore than a
lover’s literary gas-pings make an average poem.
And yours is not an average poem, Jimmy, not by
a good deal “ Tenterlield ’’: We are very much
obliged for your communication, but we would be
a great deal more obliged if we could read it. Bad
writing, in nine cases out of ten, is only a silly
affectation, and we may Inform candidates for
literary fame that indifferent caligraphy is quite
fatal to success in literature, chiefly because par-
tiall 7 illegible scrawls are always thrown to the dog.

The elder Weller did not believe in “ wid-

wise men have married widows and found them
the best of wives. Washington, Joff°rson, Frank-
lyn, Howard, Dr. Johnson all married widows,
some of them much older than their husbands,
and enjoyed as much domestic happiness as other
married men of their time. The first Napoleon
married a widow, and as long as he continued
faithful to her his progress was brilliant and suc-
cessful. The decay of his fortune dates from the
day he wickedly deprived her of her husband and
crown and bestowed them on the youthful Aus-
trian Princess.
The Americans are scared at the extremely
decollete dresses Avorn by their countrywomen
this year. They wonder where they (the ladies)
are going to fix their limit. And now listen. They
sort of complain that it is chiefly married ladies
who adopt this objectionable style of dress, or
rather undress. The question is, would they still
find fault if the majority of offenders were single
women ? But, joking aside, the Americans aren’t
far wrong. Putting indelicacy quite out of the
question, it is surely unwholesome to dispense
with covering for a part of the body which is ac-
customed to be covered, just to suit the occasion.
No doubt it’s hard for a plain-looking girl, with a
pretty neck and chest, to refrain from displaying
them; it gives her no pull over that other girl with
the handsome face, but salt-cellar shoulders, and
we don’t say she should keep them dark, as long as
she doesn’t go too far. We don’t object to the low
necks so strongly as do our American cousins, but
that’s because our Australian girls are modest, and
don’t carry fashion to such a ridiculous extreme;
therefore we have had no cause for feeling the
same disgust as the Americans profess to feel.
There are a few, however, even in Sydney, who
overstep the bounds of modesty, just a leetle; but
they are the exception and not the rule. Now if
our cousins over the river there, would help us to
talk down those monstrosities—crinolines—we
should be all there with them. After all, the low
necks only show natural charms (at least we sup-
pose so), but crinolines are apparently without
either rhyme or reason, and are wholly and utterly
abominable. Now, then, giris 1
S. W. Beck has just written a book on
“Gloves,” Avhence we compile the following facts:
The cave men Avore gloves. An eminent
geologist states that it is a fair inference that they
lived in the South of France before the cold of the
glacial period. It is about 240,000 years ago. Here
is an ancestry for gloves which must satisfy their
most ardent admirers, for the fact that gloves
were worn by these pre-historic men has been
proved by Professor Boyd Dawkins, who has
made this subject his own. Among the remains
Avhich recent research has brought to light in
France, Belgium, and Switzerland, there are some
which justified the Professor in the belief that the
cave men wore gloves, not only of ordinary size,
but reaching even to the elbows, anticipating., by
untold ages, the multi-button gloves of the Vic-
torian era. These gloves of the cave men Avere, in
all probability, formed from roughly-dressed
skins, and sewn with elaborate needles of bone ”
The “ Speculum Saxonleum ” (lib. iii.) enacted that
judges were not to wear gloves on the bench, lest
therein they should slip bribes. To present a judge
with gloves at a maiden assize is to insinuate that
he can be trusted—there being no risk of tempta-
tion I It is signiflcent that any bribe came to be
known as a pair of gloves; to have given a pair of
gloves did not always actually denote a present of
gloves, but some equally valuable gift tendered in
return for services rendered. Grose quotes from
an old play an incident where an alderman pre-
sents his glove filled with gold pieces as a bribe to
Srocure a commission for his son. The Portuguese
ave a proverb on this head, expressive of a per-
son’s integrity, “Nao traz lavas—lie does not wear
gloves.” To the Greek wife of Doge Seivo, of
Venice (1071), we may, in all seeming, attribute the
introduction of perfumed gloves into Europe.
She is strongly condemned by chroniclers tor her
perfumed gloves, and scorned, too, for wearing
silken vests, no less than for using a gold stick to
convey her food to her mouth in place of follow-
ing the ancient usage of employing fingers. The
seat of the manufacture of “chicken-gloves”
was at Limerick, but it was also carried on at
Waterford and Dublin. The gloves were there
made from the skins of unborn calves, either
taken from cows that died (when the skins were
technically known as “ njorts ”), or from parturient
pows purposely slaughtered. These latter skins
were called in the market “slinks.” These gloves
were of very fine texture. A pair of them were
included in Ralph Thoresby’s museum—* A pair of
gloves so delicately thin that, though they will fit
a largo hand, are folded up and enclosed in a gilded
walnut’s shells.’ It was this quality that gave
Limericks,” as the gloves were collectively called,
their extensive reputation. The decadence of the
Irish glove trade has been attributed to French
competition, net in general only, but by direct
effort. The Irish workmen, says one apologist, are
alone to blame. “ While the trade was still flourish-
ing, the French workmen became alive to the
superiority of Irish kid skins and the Irish method
of dressing them, and came to our country to
learn. Having gained all the information they
sought, they returned, taking with them several
Irish workers, and with all the skins they could
buy up in the Irish market. Such a proceeding,
though in nowise reprehensible on their part, pro-
duced a comparative scarcity in the home market,
and the skill of the Irish workmen, aided by the
use of machinery (there Avas not any machinery in
Ireland), enabled French manufacturers to pro-
duce excellent gloves in large quantities. The
homo makers raised their prices, Avhich the trade
refused to accept, and abandoned the Irish for the
French manufacturers.’

there until the police were communica’ed with,

engineer, who had been 20 years in the Victorian

James Campbell (or, he was better known
os Jimmy Campbell), at one time town clerk of
Ararat (Vic.), and a better hearted fellow or a more
genial companion could haraly be found—he could
take an all-round hand at whatever was going on-
had a happy style as a raconteur, could sing a good
song, and as an exponent of the character of Bailie
Nlcol Jarvie in “ Bob Roy ” there were few pro-
fessionals who could give him much of a start.
He was always ready to do a good turn for a friend,
or, for the matter of that, for anybody on whose
behalf his sympathies had been enlisted. On one
occasion a pious citizen from the neighbouring
Quartzopolis had been toying with the funds of a
Friendly Society, and Anally found himself located
in Ararat gaol for a two years’ stretch, with hard
labour. The latter meant hauling round a hand-
cart loaded with clay and stones and things to
repair the streets, and fixup the public gardens.
A friend of the party in difficulties applied to
Campbell to intercede on his behalf for a better
position; but as the prisoner still had to attend to
the cart, his friend again spoke to Campbell on the
matter. “ Well, there are some people who would
be ungrateful under any circumstances,” rejoined
the gonial C. “Before I Interested myself on his
behalf, he used to have to shove the cart along

Lady Munro is dead. Like the gentle

the reader will better understand us if wo say
Mother Munro was drowned a few days ago in a
ditch at Launceston, At one time, she was an ex-
ceedingly handsome woman, highly accomplished,
and of an active, brilliant intellect. This was her
character, however, before we chanced to know
her. When we saw her first, she was driving down
Pitt-street in a carriage drawn by a pair of high-
stepping greys. When we saw her last, a mimber
av’ the foorce, with sorrow stamped on his soul
and the map of Ireland on his face, was vainly en-
deavouring to push her up to the DaGinghurst
station on a borrowe i fruit-truck. The Laun-
ceston Examiner gives her a send - off. and
it runs thusly " Lady Munro (better known
as Mother Munro) was a sister of the well-
known Lady Mordaunt, who figured in a celebrated
divorce case in England. Mrs. Munro came to
Queensland with a captain, who passed for her hus-
band, and after a few months gave way to habits
of intemperance, going entirely to the bad. It
was stated th t she was not the wife of the cap-
tain, but had left her husband, his brother and
run away with the captain. The deceased woman
went to Sydney, and from there to Melbourne, in
both of which cities she made frequent appear-
ances at the police courts. She had an income of
£30) per annum, which she received quarterly; and
as there is ovidenc" that she was strangled before
the body was thrown into the clayhole, it was pro-
bably to get the money she had received that some
scoundrels carried out the deed.”
William Hammix received a liberal
education at the Sydney Orphanage. He was then
sent to the Catholic College at bale in Gippsland to
prosecute his studies. The curriculum at (hat
establishment was not confined to the lives of the
saints, so William had to knock about and make
himself generally useful, chopping wood, serving
at mass, humping a 5-ft. candle round the chapel
on Holidays and shepherding the Bishop s crook
whenever his Lordship dropped in that way to
administer confirmation. We next hear of him
in Rockhampton, dressed as a young woman and
hired out as a lady help, washing up, sewing and
performing the multifarious duties of a domestic
in a well-ordered family. It is just here that we
find the ground giving way under us, so wo will
skip a seductive page in Bill’s career, and look in
upon him once again—this time in the Roc ihamp-
ton watchheuse, for being a prince in disguise.
Dr. Poland was sent for, and, having carefully
studied the case, swore that William belonged to
the same sex as the Prince of Wales. The lad was
let off with a caution, but why a certificated
surgeon was sent for to testify is one of those
mysteries that will only be cleared up when the
reason is discovered why an Irishman carries his
pipe in his hat. Oh! and Dr. Poland. Do we
know him? GTangouto’ that, now! Who was
in charge of the Bendigo Hospital when De Lacy
Evans was kept for weeks under treatment as a
male lunatic and then transferred to Yarrra Bend,

others to do the same, and thus take tue bread out

“ To-morrow I am nothing; and thereafter

Sandy Brown was a well-known character
in the palmy days of the Pleasant Creek goldfield,
where he kept a grocery store and livery stable*.
Sandy was never charged with being either a
liberal-minded or a large-hearted fellow, but he
was a prominent member of the Presbyterian
Church, and an uncompromising stickler for the
tenets of the Westminster Confeasloa of Faith.
Notwithstanding his extreme piety and his baid
and fast Sabbatarian proclivities, he was never
above turning an honest penny on the Sabbath
Day, evidently forgetting that section of the Deca-
logue which enjoins on the believer the duty of
allowing his ox and his ass to participate in the
Sabbatic rest. Probably, Sandy did not consider
that tho attenuated frames wnich he stabled and
hired out to his customers as coming under the
section of the act referred to, for on Sundays he
usually drove a good trade—better, perhaps, than
on any other day of the week. And he also
had a pardonable habit-which, by tho way,
should have secured him the gold medal of
the Humane Society, many years ago—of always
cautioning his customers against reckless or
furious driving. “Don’t drive too fast, now,”
would be his invariable warning note as the horse
and chariot started from the establishment, and
the charioteer would grab the whip and make the
animated hat-r ck prance up the street. Well,
one day a prominent citizen, who had just “pegged
out,” was abmit to be carried to the local ceme-
tery, when one of the mates of the deceased
called on Sandy to hire a trap for the solemn pro-
cession. The best “moke” in the stable was
selected for the mournful occasion, a sad-looking
sable-hued animal, with a head like a child’s coffin,
a horse that would only move on compulsion.
The hirer was a stalwart “cousin Jack,” who had
previously traded with Sandy, and just as he was
about to urge for the fiery steed, the stereotyped
warning, in “braid Scotch,” “Dinna’drive too
fast,” rang in his ears It was too much for the
“Cousin,” who promptly replied with a burst of .
ornate profanity, “Damme, I’ll break his b
neck, or keep up with the funeral.”
Theresa Pauline, Countess Htnckel, died
in January in Silesia, aged 72. She was the
daughter of a Moscow tailor. To obtain her
emancipation she married her father’s cutter,
Francis Yilloing, whom she soon abandoned, In
order to begin her career as an adventuress, in
which her arms were force of will, the knowledge
of five languages, great musical talent, and a
strange beauty of a Russian type—dark hair,
enormous and prominent eyes, Kalmuck nose,
large mouth and fleshy lips, and a beautiful body
Her first conquest at Paris was the pianist, Henri
Hertz. She passed as his wife, dazzled Paris by
her luxury and beauty, and went to Court. It
being discovered that her first husband was still
living, she migrated to London, where she ab-
sorbed half a dozen fortunes, and made the
acquaintance of Count Henckel. She went back
to Paris rich enough to buy herself a real title;
and so in 1831, her first husband having died in the
meantime, she married Marquis Fr. Aranjo de
Pa'iva. He received a pension of 12,000 francs a
year in return for his title, and shot himself in
1870. Once more free, Madame de Pa’iva married
her old protector, Henckel, a cousin of Bismarck.
During the Empire Madame de Paiva lived in
royal luxury, in the Champs Elysees and at Pont-
chartrain, where she owned the chateau and
domain where Madame do la VallitSre once lived
In the Champs Elysees she built hvrself a mansion
of unheard-of interior splendour, famous for its
onyx staircase. Her wealth was fabulous; so
fabulous that she could afford to order the archi-
ehect, Lefuel, to reproduce the palace of the
Tuileries on her Silesian estate, and to have woven
a h a D 8' ln k for her Paris salmi which cost
800,000 Iranej. Her celebrated Wednesday dinners
weie never very gay. The hostess was often
absent-minded and strangely pre-occupied. There
must have been some crime in her life. On sentait
le cadavre. Madame de Paiva had the true Cir-
cassian mania for painting her face: and it was she
who set the fashion of that maquillage which the
ladies of the Empire abused. After the Franco-
German war, Madame de Pa’iva, who was sus-
pected of having been useful to her friends, the
diplomatists, rarely came to Paris ; her French
friends “dropped” her, and she retired to her
fcilesian Tuileries, carrying with her her millions
and her diamonds, that comprised the cream of
many a royal casket-from that of Marie Antoin-
ette, to that of the Empress Bugdnle, whose
diamonds, sold in London after the battle of Sedan,
adorned the neck of this painted Jezebel, when
she married her third husband in 1873.
James Boscawen Duff, Esq., late Deputy-
Registrar-General and lay-reader, has, in company
with Pym, the Post-office pilferer, been sent to
gaol; and, therefore, it is but natural to surmise
(both gentlemen being “well-connected”) the
light of society will shine but dimly for a consider-
able period. Mr. Rogers made a most affecting
appeal for Duff, enlarging upon irs excellent
character (!), and laying great stress upon the fact
that he was “sick.” These self-helping aristocrats
somehow, generally are sick at these peculiar
junctures. The mental strain is more, you see,
than their poor nervous systems can bear. But
the jury seemed unable to reconcile to themselves
the notion that Mr. Duff’s sickness entitled him to
the privilege of stealing £1100 odd of the public
money, and lloscawen was convicted and sen-
tenced to four years, without lard labour—a piece
of astounding clemency on the part of a kind-
hearted Judge (!), which will, no doubt, sink deep
into the grateful heart of society 1 The trouble
S, ow ,J s ’^ owever ’ th at the church-w irdeus at the
North Shore will be under the necessity of enlist-
ing a new plate bumper, and we are sure Bos-
cawen’s services at the lectern will be sorely
missed by the aristocratic congregation. And ail
this reminds us that a curious circumstance in con-
nection with this martyr’s downfall consists in the
tact that no one seems to have any idea what
he has done with the money. And it is, perhaps, a
significant fact that in every case of a conviction
ot one of these “ holy rogues ” the same question
arises, making it ever tho father of a deal ot won-
dering surmise on the part of the public. They are
never seen to spend anything; eschew drink and
cigars; wear costumes of tho short-pants-and-
ootton umbrella type; and are “ deeply interested
in all vital subjects even distantly affecting the I
welfare of the country.” They don’t speculate; !
do not gamble or bet; are not even known to have
a tight-rope dancer “ under their protection.”
we believe, in many cases, they have the plunder
safe all tha time, and trust to influence and thn
clergy to pull them through without having lA
aisgorge, It is easy enough to spend money in
Sydney, heaven knows! But when you do spend
it, your habits become at once known to a lanrc
number of people. Why, it was only the other
day that, having won a considerable stake on »
root-race, we ordered at the Diner de Paris a half
crown bottle of claret. And didn't the pn 0n |'
crane their necks! Commanding, subsequent]!-

extreme condition of gravy, Vi SaprUsti! mats il J

twelvemonths) went in for betting, and took thn
money in order to accomplish a “slither-" and
from his extreme clumsiness in the matter it
probable that, prior to doing this unimportant
burgle, he had never stolen anything belonging tn
the Postmaster-General of more intrinsic valnn

circle of friends.
Nubar Pasha is over sixty; a short, cornu
lent, dark-complexioned man, with affinities fn?
knavish men and knavish ways. When Mehemet
A.li kept a tobacco divan in Macedonia, ho and
Nubar s father were engaged together in merean
tila transactions. Nubar was sent West to studv
European languages for commercial purpose
He boarded with a pastor, wont to a day-school
and acquired a superficial touch of respectable
Protestantism, which enables him to get on with
good English people. Nubar’s good temper and
quick intelligence recommended him whnn
young, to Mehemet All. That successful ad
venturer was, when he took the Armenian
Into h , 13 service, old, suspicious, and irritable
Nubar s discretion was never at fault. Ibrahim
was sent on a political tour in the West, and Nubar
was chosen to bo his confidential scribe He
watched and quietly waited for advancement, and
was attentive to the French Colonel geve who
organized the Egyptian Army. That person was
able to dispose of military contracts. Nubar came
•gain to England in 1850, to represent Egypt at the
Hyde Park Crystal Palace. *Pam.” made much
of him. While Ismail was playing his close game
against Abbas Pasha and Said Pwha Nub« Zs
engaged on diplomatic missions to Europe n.
Said s removal he became Ismail s rignt-hand man
It was Nubar who obtained from Abdul Aziz the
right to change the order of succession in
Egypt, and who Invented the title of Khedive
Having at the Porte only to bribe Turkish officials'
and being provided with ample funds to do so
Nubar met with no obstacles there; but he had
difficulties with the foreign Embassies. An envoy
who stood upon his dignity must have failed The
Armenian used, whenever he called on M. Bourtee
the Ambassador of Napoleon HI., to kiss his hand
as he entered and took leave. A person once to
whom he was relating the history of his negotia-
tions, started on hearing to what length of syco-
phancy he went. “ Que voulez-vous '? ” said
Nubar; Bourteo est un imbecile, et tnoi io
suis un Oriental.” Nubar taught his master in
make hay while the sun shone. Egvnt is
now bankrupt, but Ismail and the “ practi-
cally English ” Nubar are arch-millionaires.
When Ismail s throne tottered, Nubar, without a
mo ? ie iP, t 8 ,hesitation, turned against him-not
probably, from personal Ill-will, but because good
Imth and trickery are words which to him mean
self-interest. There is no better husband
father and relation than Nubar. Last winter the
struggle which he underwent between paternal
love and financial prudence cost him sharp pangs
He had set his heart on marrying his daughter tea
Prince. But the dowry required was enormous
and the excellent papa did not think he could
safely give It, unless he could first succeed la ob-
taining a water concession from the Khedive, to
obtain which he has long manosuvred. He wants
to make a canal from the first Nile Cataract, to ir-
rigate that part of the desert bordering the fertile
Delta. Possibly, now that he has again attained
power, his daughter will marry the Prince her
dowry being provided either by the Egyptian
people or by dupes on the Stock Exchange?
When we first saw Dr. Quick, M.L.A. for
Bendigo, he was a boy, driving a whim for 5s a
week, then he became connected with Mackav’s
paper-the Bendigo Advertiser— studied in his
leisure hours, obtained a degree In arts at the Mel-
bourne University, and, subsequently turning his
attention to law, boro off the coveted L.LD. Just
as the French conscript carries a marshal’s baton

members. Mackay has a voice like a barrel-organ

monkey twisting the handle the wrong wav Bur-

to be an error. It was another law student who
had to wade through the poad with a mob of
young medicos urging him on with ribald exnre«-
siona punctuated with mud. Of course we re-
member the row that took place a few years ago
when the authorities elos-. d the doors of the Mel-
bourne University, till the rights of the d iron to
between Law and Medicine were discovered
is how it was. A letter appeared (in the Melbourne
Daily Telegraph, we think) from a la w student
complaining of the medical boysThat they wme
doubtful linen, carried black clay pipes about an
inch long in their waistcoat pockets, smoked to-
bacco strong enough to make the bo’s’n of an
American whaler pelt sharks with his Christmas

they saw a man with hooked nose and
superabundant rings standing at his shop

when young ladies without gloves looked their

calumny. It is well-known that medical Students

nearly all, is eminently readable. She has great
invention, almost Invariably extraordinary vl-
vaeitv of style, and. without overdoing it. is
admirable at descriptive scenery. In the selec-
tion of chapter titles as a sort of “index to
contents” she is particularly happv. Her
Method of work is this: having first men-
blribofated her plot, she accurately skele-
tonises It, as It were, on a large card, adding
thereto names of characters, their relationships,
chronological mems, &c. &c. Everything being
thus mapped out, she works away so many hours
a day, putting flesh and skin and tint and ‘expres-
sion upon the dry bones; and, on an average, turns
out two novels a year. Mrs.Maxwell (MissBraddon
married Maxwell the publisher—possibly to re-
venge on his the wrongs sustained by her tribe) is
a shrewd business woman— her lather was a London
solicitor. She loves luxury; is most kindly in her
disposition; has a passion for horses and dogs, and
yet has a frugal mind and a weather eye always
open to the main chance. She isn’t above con-
niving at the publication as new of old work done
by her in her green childhood; and she has had the
Philistine barbarity (not to say brutality) to cut
down the works of Scott, Cooper, and other
eminent writers to a size suitable for a penny issue
(for the million) by her husband's firm. In 1873
she published a drama called “Grlselda,” which,
notwithstanding the fact that prior to 1863 she had
had a good deal of theatrical experience, and
despite the dramatic power shown in many of her
novels, proved a decided “frost.” Neither as the
editor of Belgravia has Mrs. Maxwell proved a
success, her conduct of that magazine disclosing
that she does not possess the faculty of literary
discrimination. She can word-paint from nature
herself, but is only a very poor judge of what
others can do in that line. It has been her good
luck to make a pile by hitting the taste of to-day.
When to-day becomes to-morrow, Miss Braddon,
her sensational novels and their success, will in all
probability be forgotten.

Viveur, gambler, peculator, he fattened on the
viops of half the fools of Europe The 1856
edition of “Men of the Time” mixed up Robert
Owen and Bishop Wilberforce in a most exasper-
ating way for the latter. Under “ Oxford, Bishop
of,” was the following: “A sceptic as regards re-

Here's an old story of il re galantuomo re-told
Shortly after his marriage, he met a peasant-girl
upon the steps of the Palace at Turin. “ Do point
out the King to me,” she begged ; “ I should like
to see him.” “I am the King,” he said. “Eh I
bah !” said the girl, laughing into his face. “ The
Princess would not h?.ve chosen such an ugly
man.”
Do you Know the man we love above all
others on this earth ? Well, we'll tell you. The
demure youth who comes in at our busiest time
with a little trifle in verse, hastily thrown off,
which he thinks will suit us.
They say that though Chiarini made a pile
at Cootamundra, ho wont awav without leaving a
farthing wherewith to burv his tentman. Scott,
who was killed by an accident. What of that?
Why, if we were to bury all the people we u»e up
in the course of the year, we should always hare a
hearse at the door. Pooh!
It is a common truism that one of the con-
demnedest bard things to achieve is minding your
own business An editor, however, knows ‘that
the hardest thing is to get other folks to allow him
to mind his own business. Yes.

declares: “The Welsh who have come to Queens-

WHERE TO INVEST !
IN THE CLIVE ESTATE,
RIVERSTONE.
Because the high price brought by city pro-
perty causes purchasers to go further afield.
CLIVE ESTATE,
Situated in the busy and prosperous township
of Riverstone, being only twenty odd miles from
Sydney. This locality is favourhbly known as a
health-giving and invigorating district, its salu-
brious atmosphere being universally recognised,
rendering the settlement the most desirable in the
colony: possessing the advantages of direct city
communication, a thriving and increasing trade,
with the luxury and retirement of country life. The
Railway accomodation is excellent, there being
five passenger trains a day, with extra accomoda-
tion on Wednesday and Saturday, besides numer-
ous goods trains daily, and additional trains will
be run as occasion requires. This Estate offers
facilities superior to any in the market. The
land holds an elevated position, and is beautifully
watered by an extensive creek, guarded with high
banks covered with nutritious verdure, containing
an inexhaustible quantity of water; in the driest
season the supply of the limped dementis prolific,
as clear as the crystal spring of an enchanted glen,
and shedding a balmy influence over the district.
There is neither rock nor gully to be found
throughout the entire property, and the remark-
able growth and production on this and the sur-
rounding farms, vineyards, and oram eries satis-
factorily prove the unmistakable fertility of the
soil. This Estate has been partly cultivated, and
consists of productive, loamy soil, on which nutri-
tious pasturage, and, in fact, all vegetation,
abounds in luxuriant profusion. Two residences
erected are at present occupied, and numerous
others are projected. The Railway Station is with-
in a few yards, and the road leading therefrom on
to the property is well metalled, and a substantial
Bridge crosses the Creek, from which a Govern-
ment road leads through a public reserve directly
into the main road of the Estate, 100 feet wide,
and laid out on the latest scientific principles for
the enhancement of the property, rendering it a
model township, which must rapidly rise in archi-

WHEN TO INVEST I
WHERE TO INVEST !
WHAT TO INVEST IN I
LAND! Because so long as the colony advances
land cannot decrease in value.
LAND! Because its acquisition is the first step
towards prosperity and position.
LAND! Because you can build a house and
save the exorbitant price charged for house rent.
LAND! Because by so doing you can leave a
legacy to your children that is always increasing
in value.
LAND! Because, should your inclinations so
lie, you can cultivate Farm or Garden pioduce,
or direct your attention to that most profitable
and pleasing occupation of raising poultry, the
demand for such being ever increasing, and the
pursuit of which will give healthful recreation to
yourself and family.
WHY INVEST!
Because you never know when reverses may
come, and money that is invested in land is always
secure. Because a man who is a landed proprietor
is a better Citizen, a better Husband, and a better
Father.
WHEN TO INVEST !
Now that Land is at a low price, in consequence
of money being tight, large buyers are not inclined
to invest, and thus allow small capitalists to secure
some of the good things of this world. NOW!
Because Land can never be cheaper than it is at
the present time. NOW! Because the rapid
increase in population must create a demand for
new settlements. NOW! Because you are earning
good wages, and a few shillings a week will never
be missed by you. NOW! Because the shillings
invested at present will rapidly grow into pounds.
HOW TO INVEST !
In Land in Small Allotments that have been
laid out by the practical agents whose experience
teaches them where increase in value is likely to
ensue, and whose interest Is identical with the
purchasers’ to advance the value of land they are
selling.
WHY INVEST IN SMALL ALLOTMENTS?
Because the property has been chosen by practi-
cal men with a view to its utility. Because the
blocks are laid out on a scientific principle con-
ducive to sanitary comfort and advantageous
position. Because, the roads having been given,

, PLIES.—TENDERS are invited for the fol-
lowing Public Works and Supplies. For full parti-
culars see Government Gazette, a file of which
is kept at every Post Office in the colony.
Tenderers may be in attendance when the tenders
are opened, and the name of the successful
tenderer will be announced, if possible, before the
duties of the Board have terminated.
No tender will be taken into consideration un-
f. A. WEIGHT,
tectural beauty and Intrinsic value. The sur-
roundings of the property materially assist the
favourable aspect, being bounded on the west by
the property of Mr. W. Stevenson; on the east by
the Township, Hotels, Stores, and Railway Station;
on the south by extensive Crown reserves, with
old-established vineyards adjoining; on the north
by pasture land, with works in the rear belonging
to Mr. Richards. Vast strides have been made in
the improvement of this district within the past
twelve months, and business and population have
Increased, a public school erected, and a great
number of new buildings have been erected; and
numerous residences and stores are rising every
day. To show the hona fides of the foregoing in-
adequate description of the many advantages
possessed by this property, intending purchasers
are particularly urged to personally inspect the
land, and to buyers of 10 iots and upwards the
return railway fare will be refunded. In conclu-
sion, it would be urged that this is not a specula-
tion, but will prove to investors a provision for
the present and future.

A VALUABLE LEGACY WORTH LEAVING
TO THE WIFE OR CHILDREN.
Until recently, none but [the affluent were able
to become freeholders of their native land, such
luxury being alone for the wealthy classes; but
under the present administration in this glorious
land of New South Wales, deservedly known as
THE GARDEN OF THE WORLD,
there is no excuse for the poorest man paying ex-
travagant rentals, for he is enabled to become the
owner of the land he cultivates and the homestead
that shelters him. Remember, Sixpence a week
for 90 weeks secures a piece of Land that will en-
able you to become the owner of a valuable site
lor Business Purposes or Villa Residence, for
Garden Produce or Poultry Raising, and within
the next lew years become valuable beyond the
most sanguine anticipations. This is an invest-
ment without risk—the first steps towards pros-
perity and wealth—and particularly recommeded
to young married couples, either for farming
their homestead, or an purposes, a site for
Investment for their children.
Notice.— Only until the 26th Inst, will these
Allotments be sold at 45s., after which date the
remainder, if any, will be 60s. an Allotment.

Messrs. Elliott Brothers.
Gentlemen,—Some few weeks ago, I was so
severely affected with indisposition as to render
my rising each morning a matter of difficulty and
?aln, on account of severe pains in my back ; and
was just beginning to realise that I would have
to absent myself from my work for a time, when
a friend recommended me to try Hamburg Tea,
mentioning at the same time the benefit he him-
self had received. At the time I used it, I really
was not fit for my work, and yet in the course of
three or four days I was myself again, and have
not suffered since. I write this conscientiously,
for the guidance of others, and you are at liberty
to make what use you please of it.
Tours faithfully,

EMIL FRBSE’S HAMBURG TEA.
RELIABLE, SIMPLE, EFFECTUAL,
This well-known Tea has proved itself to be a
most certain and efficacious Remedy for such
diseases as Sudden and Severe Colds, Coughs,
Fevers and Ague, Asthma. Phthisis, Headache,
Bowels, Kidney and Liver Complaints, the Piles,
Congestion, &c„ caused by an impure state or a
superfluity of blood. Its use removes Scrofula,
Cutaneous Eruptions, Pimples on the Face,
Blotches, Boils, Rheumatic Pains, and Pains in the
Bones and Joints. It is a preventative against
Contagion, and destroys inhaled Miasmatic and
Contagious Vapours. It purifies the Blood,
cleanses the Stomach and Bowels, and gives to the
whole system a healthy, easy tone. It opens the
bowels in a very mild and certain way. It works
on the system generally, causing little or no dis-
comfort. It will prevent almost any disease if
used at least once a month. It restores the appe-
tite, it removes the distress caused by eating
hearty food or overloading the stomach, and will
be found effectual as a Family Remedy where a
simple purgative only is needed.
NO FAMILY SHOULD BE WITHOUT IT.

theatre Royal—“ It’s Never tob Late p 8
Opera House—“Fedora” lb.
The Royal people promise us the “ Silve
Kintr ” on Saturday (33nd). The week intervenln
between the departure of “Rip Van Winkle” anc
the advent of the silver potentate has been give
u n to Charles Reade’s “It’s Never too Late t
Mend,” with Damplcr as Tom Robinson. Wo wen
there on Saturday night last, and this is what w
a aW . A capital farm-yard scene in the first act-
scene suggestive cf sky-larks, milkmaids, an
urattling brooks; of prosperous yoemen and con
tented clod-hoppers. Poultry were pecking at th
ripe corn, pigeons cooing in a cote, and an fnquisi
tive wether wandering round the stage-boxes t
see that the occupants behaved themselves. Ther
were a couple of men threshing, too, but from th
way they handled the flails, and the determinatio
they evinced to make the job put them over th
Winter, it was easy to see their hearts were not i
the work, and that shaking for drinks or “ trot-
ting ” at an auction was more in their line. Georg
Fielding (Mr. Stoneham) and his brother William
(Mr. Lenton) were there. They quarrel end “stack
their duds” for a “mill,” when Susan Merto
(Misa Towers), George’s sweetheart, interrupt
them, tells them what a dreadful thing it is fo
brothers to fight, especially within sight of th
village church, and makes them shake hands
This was a bit of a disappointment to the galler
people, who were joyfully noisy at the prospect o:
a “set-to,” and as noisily obstreperous when the
saw the sponge go up without a round. Why th
proximity ol the church should stop the row it i
hard to say, considering that, in our day, mor
bickerings take place inside those sacred edifice
than outside. George would like to marry Susan
and, when we remember how she looked on Satur
day night, we are not a bit surprised at it. Bu
his farming has not been succesful, and hi
money’s gone. Aye, there’s the rub. As society
is constituted in these days, we declare it to be ou
belief that if an anthropoid ape were to land
England to-morrow with a fair-sized Tambaroora
nugget in his possession he could carry off the
belie of any village from the Tweed to Cornwall
and obtain the blessing of her parents and the
parson on the match.
• • ■
Just then Tom Robinson (Mr. Dampier
comes along, and is greeted with £10 worth oj
damage to the fixtures. He has been in California
has Tom, and—in prison. Ho prefers California
aad trios to get George to return with him. He
would have succeeded but for a trifling contre
temps- three policemen. They are silent men
who appear to know their duty, so they simply
ask no questions but slip a pair of hand-cuffs on
him, address him by a string of aliases, smile with
him when he smiles, and surpass him in gravity
when he frowns. We next see him in a mode
prison with Josephs (Miss Lily Dampier), a boy
whose penalty for stealing a handful of potatoes
is some months’ starvation and silence. A view ol
the interior and routine of the prison received ap-
plause from many in the audience for its fidelity
to nature-its resemblance to the reality. We prefer
sot to follow this subject up. One thing can be seen
at a glance—that the prison is in England. Had il
been in N.S. Wales, some corner in the yard or
corridor would betaken up by the triangles, where
the angry swish of the “cat” and the yells of the
tortured supply such pleasant music to the official
ear. And this reminds us that the mental aberra-
tion that has succeeded in placing Australia in the
van of nations possessing barbarous penal codes,
is just as curious in its way as the mediaeval crazes
that sent myriads to rot in Palestine,'or suggested
to juvenile fanatics the necessity for being
whipped daily if they would be saved. Crimes
that in most civilised countries would be met with
a 5s. fine or a 48-hours’ seclusion from the world
are, in this favoured democracy, punished by the
tortures of the damned—tortures that even the
unspeakable” Turk is erasing from his statute
book. Odd, isn t it ? Once we asked a soldier, a
couple ol hours after he had received 50 lashes for
being drunk on guard, if the punishment was bad.
The musket-ball that was round in his mouth
when the first stroke was given was as thin as a
wafer when he was taken down. “ Well,” he said.
I thought every belt ’ud cut me in two.”

He would be quite full but for the amusing tom-

he had refused to do so in England, when Tom got

But Crimp now begins to show his teeth, and be-
comes as unpleasantly familiar as the Hebrew
financier in whose hands your paper is daily ripen-
ing. He has discovered all about the secret mar-
riage, and communicates the knowledge to Sir
Iflarry, who receives it about as pleasantly as John
JVTKlhone the news that there was a lady with a
cowhide waiting for him on the lobby. Crimp ob-
tains the marriage certificate out of a secret drawer
(a ‘realistic” drama without a secret drawer, a
lost will, or a kidnapped child, is like Jack and the
no Giant and ne’er a Jack), requires
£30,000 for his share of the plunder and £10,000 for
the certificate—obtains a cheque for the lot—hears
that the clergyman and witnesses of the marriage
are all dead, and thechurch containing the register
burned down—sees his master tears the certificate
into fragments—picks up the latter, and puts them
into his pocket for future use—and starts for New
Zealand.
• • •
You have guessed that wnen Mrs. Sir
Edward Chater publishes her marriage, the new
baronet denies it and demands proofs. As the
only proof is the palched-up certificate in Crimps’s
pocket, her chance of seeing her che-i-ld righted
would not be taken on “spec.” by any “Dodson
and Fogg ” Sydney firm that looks through the
papers daily for speculative libel actions. And
now there Is an interval of twenty years. When
the curtain again rises, we are in New Zealand
during the Maori war. Von Tempsky appears
with a sword that would bisect an ichthyosaurus.
He gives as his private opinion that although
English, French, Germans, Russians, and others
may be pretty fair at fighting, still, when there’s
any real, hard work to be done—any guns to be
spiked in the face of a withering fire—any rebels
to be upended in the face of desperate odds—the
colonials were the only lads could do it clean.
This sentiment was received with a wild yell of
defiance by the younger portion of the audi-
ence; but we noticed that several elderly
tradesmen (vendors of lollies, apples, oranges,
lemonade, and roast potatoes), who had un-
luckily been born in the neighbourhood of Rad-
clitfe Highway, protested in a manner more vigor-
ous than complimentary. However, we got
a glimple into the Maori and forest-ranger life of
20 years ago. As we were a forest-ranger once
ourselves, it’s pleasant after such a lapse of years
to see the life of our hot youth brought before us
once more. Of course, it’s not like what we re-
member, but that makes it all the more entertain-
ing. As Te Whiti—described in the bill as a
“Maori rebel chief”—Mr. Beaumont gave us a
treat, both in appearance and language, which will
not be forgotten while we’ve a hair left. His com-
mand of the native tongue was pleasantly accu-
rate. The words pakeha, kopi, waipera, hoea, and
puckaroo came rolling out of him like ribaldry
from Uriah when he found the trick David played
on him. Crimp, having run through all his money,
has taken to selling ammunition to the Maoris.
Even then, he couldn’t keep straight, so Te Whiti
ties him up like one of the Davenpert Brothers,
and has just commenced to roast him when Yon
Tempsky and his forces, consisting of the two
young Chaters-ono the son of the murdered
baronet, and the other of his successor—roll up
and clear the gangway. Crimp is rescued, and a
fierce combat takes place between Te Whiti and
Von Tempsky. You can see by the way thev go to
work that one or both will quickly know whether
Martin Luther is still in Purgatory. It is Von
Tempsky. A shot from the neighbourhood of the
green-room catches him sideways in the anterior
portion of the abdominal viscera, when the gal-
lant Prussian falls, makes a neat little speech, and
dies to a pizzacato accompaniment from the trom-
bone.
* * *
The opinion he had of the fighting quali-
ties of Volunteers andlForest-rangers was not that
of the M aorls, among’ whom the irregular troops
were known as “ Gammon the sogers.” Justice
could not be much longer delayed. Young Chater
comes ia for his own, tha wicked baronet and his
ci-devant valet meet a well-deserved fate, and the
curtain goes down on a scene of happiness enough
to convince any larrikins present that life, even
deprived of the relaxation of jumping on your
mother, or crippling a Chinaman, can be made
fairly tolerable.

during the interpretation and her ladyship’s hys-
terics that an opportunity is given Glover for a
piece of amusing by-play, of which he makes the
most. As the Baroness Tournis, Mies I'ocy Main-
waring has little to do except dress well and flirt
with anybody coming her way. At the opening of

SPORTING.
On Tuesday we had the pleasure of a call
made by Edward Hanlan, the champion sculler. We
are not greatly gone on scullers, as a rule, and were
not specially glad till we were faee to face, and
then we were very glad, indeed. Hanlan is a down-
right hearty-looking fellow, who looks a man
straight in the faee when he speaks, with honest
eyes and frank pleasant manners. We didn’t take
a shabby advantage of his call to “interview ” him.
But we had a quiet chat, much more concerned to
gather what sort of man he is, than to pump out
of him “impressions” laboriously manufactured
to meet the demand, or plans and projects which
it may be important to him to keep to himsell.
But. talk about Etonian being “a little wonder 1 ’
Bosh I If you didn’t know who he Is, you might
pass him without notice. But. when you look for
the secret of his successes, his clothes don’t hide
it. Of medium height, Hanlan looks as if he were
solid right through. His pantaloons can’t conceal
the muscular development of his thighs, and his
coat-sleeves are straightened with the muscular de-
velopment of his arms. Chest, and loins, tell their
story of power while the sculler Is in ordinary attire.
After two minutes’ study of Hanlan, one is done
with all lingering fancies about secret propellois
and magnetic engines. The man is a magnetic
engine himself; a reservoir of nervous energy.
No doubt he is, as he has stated since landing, in
fat condition, just now. But so is everybody in
ordinary life; so that comparisons of muscular
development are all the surer under the circum-
cumstances. After briefly viewing and convers-
ing with Edward Hanlan, we are satisfied that he
has beaten all competitors simply because he was
able to do it. Physical power of an unusua
kind, directed by an amount of intelligence not
often combined with great animal strength : add
to this a natural good temper, and a resolute dis-
position, and one doesn't want any mechanism in
a boat. There are probably stronger men among
scullers than Hanlan. And there are smarter men
among them, perhaps. And men with more des-
Eerate endurance. And men with even smoother
alance of disposition to make the best of things,
and lose nothing by worry and fret. But when
the man is found who combines these qualities
more aptly than they are combined in Haman, that
man will beat him.
No doubt Mr. Hunt’s offer of the £1000
match has led Hanlan to believe there is plenty
money to be made at the game in the colonies, if
thousands are flying about so plentifully that
Hunt could make money out of the spec, after
paying Hanlan the thou, which the Canadian
would win for a certainty—at least, so far a cer-
tainty as any sporting contest can be looked upon.
But we fancy, before Hanlan has seen much more
of the colonies and Dan O’Connor, he will see the
error he has fallen into, and will be only too glad
to accept the Oxford man’s offer, should it still be
open—for no doubt Hanlan’s putting up at another
pub. will alter the arrangements of Mr. Hunt, who
must haye counted on hundreds from the attrac-
tion at his house. Shortly after his arrival, Hanlan
was interviewed by a D.T. reporter, who swallowed
all the Canadian’s tit-bits as easily as a wabbegong
would a lump of fat pork—or the Hon. John M.L C.
The “official ” reception took place on Monday
morning last, when an immense crowd blocked the
streets on the way from the steamer’s wharf to the
OxfordHotel,where some speechifying inthe idiotic
style usual on such occasions was gone through.
Dan O’Connor was “ up to his neck in it,” but the
effect of his oration upon us was rather marred up-
on hearing a bystander giving it on good authorlt v
that Dan’l had already entered into a contract with
the Champion for the supply of underdone pork-
chops during the coming training. But, perish
the thought, the “ jaynil Irishman” would get in on
his brother meat merchants in this fashion. Han-
lan came out with a few remarks—of course, could
not find words to express Hs feelings—did not see
that any quantity of dollars could be mentioned
in comparison with such a welcome—(Heaven for-
give you, Ned, for we cannot)—beautiful harbour
—was not a representative of any country, but
simple Edward Hanlan, getting his living by row-
ing (very simple 1 scooped in £30,000 since 1873)
—considers on principle he should be matched
against Trickett first, as he wrested the champion-
ship from Trickett (very much simplicity in this,
eh, Ned ?), and concluded by saying that he was
open to row any man who came forward. Han-
lan has only brought one boat with him, built by
Ruddock, of Boston, and intends to give an order
in the colony as soon as he has time to look round
the various sheds ; but no doubt the choice will
rest between Donnelly and Sullivan, and Dodd, of
North Shore, so far as Sydney is concerned.
Amongst the races to be ruo on Saturday
next at Canterbury Park, is that for the Ladies’
Bracelet. The first prize is a magnificent broad
gold bracelet, ornamented with three horse-shoes
set with rubies and brilliants and surmounted by
a large diamond. The second prize is also a gold
bracelet, ornamented with a horse-shoe and whip,
set with rubies and brilliants. The value of these
trophies is 50gs. and 20gs. respectively. They were
designed and manufactured by hvan Jones, of
Hunter-street.


PEPPER AND SALT.
We have just got the first number of the
Gloucester Gazette. This paper is run by a
promising young party named Courtney, at Ray-
mond Terrace, and contains a splendid account of
a pie-concealing match, and a deal of well edited
matter which would be a dead secret to every one
who had not read the dailies. There is, also, a
charming prose-poem upon “Washed and Un-
washed Butter,” and a well selected niece (also in
prose) on “ Kicking Cows.” The leaders are both
humerousand lofty: “In politics we will go for
measures irrespective of men . . .” though
there is no other direct foreshadowing of a muslin
frock and silk stocking policy. Tho following,
part of the same article, we admire lor its out-
spoken frankness:—“If you wish to give us a
practical shove along, send us your name as a sub-
scriber, and don’t be afraid to enclose a year’s sub-
scrlptlon in advance ” But we note, with surprise,
that though this is the organ of Gloucester, and
there is something about “Chills,” there is not
even a poem on the subject of “Cheese.” We
don’t mind giving an idea for an introduction
Here, now:—
Milking In the morning breeze
Was a dairy-maid of Gloucester:
“ Please explain how you make cheese,”
Smilingly we did accost her.
“ ’Tis of you, dear, pretty maid
That we long so much to learn!
You will ‘ drop ’ when we have said—
You’re the magnet of our churn."
And so on. The G.G. is 3d. a copy; and the print-
ing bears distinct evidence of a really first-class
lawn-mower.
• • •
A THRILLING NARRATIVE.
We don’t mind admitting that at distant
intervals we have, actuated by a spirit of envy for
his splendid attainments, evinced a disposition to
gibe at Mr. J. Henniker Heaton, who is the well-
known author of the “ Dictionary of Dates,” the
chariot of a late Governor, and the portrait of
Lord Sydney. We view now our small and paltry
conduct with peculiar regret; for, by his splendid
contribution—“ Prom Sydney to Marseilles in a
French steamer”—which recently ineffably adorned
the columns of Waterloo’s chosen journal, we
find our satire returned upon ourselves; we dis-
cover ourselves withered by the blast of our own
sarcasm I The return of Mr. Heaton was some-
what of a surprise to us, since we had thought him
still scintillating in the salons of the great and
gilded, hissing his cunning counsel into the ear-
holes of bewildered diplomats. Wo had, indeed,
supposed he was lost to us; and would have
thought, with a tear and a shudder, that he was
dead, had we not at times seen paragraphs about
him, chronicling his wonted triumphal progress.
Mr. J. Henniker Heaton is, however, none the less
welcome. He would have been welcome even had
he but driven round, his old self, to see us, in his
glittering equipage, and gone across with us to the
fish-shop. But, covered as he is now with literary
glory, what in the whole world of welcomes could
surpass the strength of the aeeueil we now (re-
spectfully) vouchsafe him I We are content to
hide us in our little corner’, and gaze at him timidly
from afar off. In his sketch, Mr. Heaton deftly
adopts every style the language affords—he is in
turn discursive, biographical, descriptive, digni-
fied, nautical, and statistical, and he evinces an
elevated sense of the proprieties which would do
credit to an oyster. We say an oyster, because,
althoug h we have in our time had some pretty
Intimate relations with these bivalves, we have
never either heard an oyster bring a blush to
the di eek by a calembour risqut, or seen one
at , theatre “ with the wife of a gentle-
man at present in England.” In a breezy
introd action we learn—and we could almost hear
the nt iurmur of the sad sea waves as we read it—
that “We had ‘a full ship,’ so far as regards
c 9.rifo . for besides minerals, there were 5000 bales
of wool, together with a large quantity of tallow
for tho French market.” Hardly have we time to
ponder over this picturesque piece, than the gifted
writer hurries us on to a dramatic description of—
we rapturously quote—“An extremely good-
looking young fellow, who at one time attained
quite a European reputation for tho unique
character of a tragedy in which he took part. Dis-
covering his wife in an act of infidelity, he killed
her lover, cut out his liver, fried it, and made his
wife eat it.” Now mark, how delicately, yet with
what fine tact, Mr. H. carries on tho conversation:
—“ I asked him how he, so young, so good-looking
so amiable in manner, could have thought of and
carried out so exquisite [!!!!] a mode of punish-
ment.” The good-looking young man, however,
merely contented himself saying that he had in-
tended to have killed his wife “ when she had eaten
the liver,” but, “cooling down,” ho allowed her
to live on. The captain, he tells us, in trenchant,
graphic terms, is named Bretei (French for braces!)
and is quite a hero. When, at length tired of
war’s alarms, weary of “manias: blockades and
capturing Mexican vessels; of being attacked in
force by the Mexicans, and getting ‘his coat
riddled with balls,” . . . [We must stop a
moment just to wipe our eyes. En route.] this
gallant officer set about “finding a wife.” How
he did it, is beautifully and pathetically told.
Ecoutez “ He went to his model mother [whoop!]
and told her ... he desired that she should
choose a wife for him—one that she knew and
whose conduct she had carefully observed. After
much deliberation and planning, the young lady
was nominated. [I] Bretei was introduced, and,
after spending a few evenings together ....
the result was a happy union.” We get no
more about the “model mother,” nor the
pair of braces — we mean Bretels — but the
author, in language whose loftiness reminds
us of the “flies” [? skies.— Ed. B.] describes
the horrors of a cyclone. The sailors, ho states,
we ordered “to lower down the royal gallant [!!]
and top-gallant masts, to fold up the fore and aft
sails;” and shortly after this the waves rose
mountains high, but, as Mr. Heaton deftly has if;
no harm comes, because of “the fine ship rising
triumphant over the majority of them.” Dlsi
cover us anything in Clark Russell more vivid than
this 1 What we admire is the lowering down of the
“royal gallant.” We understand that this passage
was much admired, also, at the Circular Quay! 11 At
Reunion, he proudly and loyally exclaims—“ I was
the means of serving our Queen.” At Port Louis
our author goes to lunch with the Governor, and
says—or rather, sings -“I had no sooner left the
ship than an Indian servant came on board with a
parcel for me, which excited no suspicion, as I was
a friend of the captain, and the parcel was secured
in my cabin by my little wife.” There is a sweet
touch now; there is a connubial gem! The parcel
contained some despatches (for the Queen, we
suppose), which the French Government would
allow no one but Hennikor to take. Fearlessly—it
is his nature to be fearless—he undertook the
arduous duty, and sailed away home to eternal
glory, armed with the following:—“V.R.: We,
Charles St. John, Esquire, &c. &c.. Her Britannic
Majesty’s Consul in the Island of Reunion, request
and require, in the name of Her Majesty, all those
whom it may concern, to allow Hennlker Heaton,
Esq., to pass freely without let or hindrance, ana
to afford him every assistence and protection of
which he may stand in need. Given at the British
Consulate, Reunion, the 29th day of January, 1881.
C. St. John, Her Britannic Majesty’s Consul for
Reunion; a document, by the way, which leads us
to think, somehow, that “we, Charles St. John,
Esquire, etc etc ,” must be rather a good Judge of
rum. We once more offer the illustrious author
our heartfelt felicitations, and, when our cat lays,
we wiii give him a testimonial.

The good little boys and girls were waiting
outside Sunday-school on a Sabbath morn, at
Bullocktown, for their kind teachers to come and
impart unto them the touching adventures of
Samuel, the wonderful wisdom of Solomon (with
certain discreet reservations), and all about how
Saul played a kind of Scriptural Aunt Sally with
David, when displeased at that musician’s rendi-
tion, on the harp, of the Dead March in himself.
The scholars had oaten all the quinces, and grapes,
and apples Providence had delivered into their
hands on the way; there had been a boy-and-glrl
scuffle about the merits of Farmer Gilboy’s roan
draught-mare; they had taken it In turns to play
fantasias on the bell, until the neighbours were
lashed into fury ; they had ornamented the door
with original designs in chalk, purloined from the
school house; they had set the tank running, and
had broken a window. And yet a little later to
hear those darling children singing—
“ Childhood's years are passing o’er us,
Youthful days will soon be done;
Cares and sorrows lie before us,
Hidden dangers, snares unknown ”—
was a sweet, beautiful and soul-softening thing.
And curiously enough, the boy that sings in the
most soft and ethereal way generally takes a tame

A gentleman, signing himself “Colonial
Scribe,” has been good enough to forward us a
“satire.” It is written on foolscap paper, and is
exactly a yard long. The subject of the satire Is
“politics”; and we are bound to say our poet is,
in some circumstances, a trifle more severe than
wo could wish. The wounds he inflicts are, indeed,
in some eases, of so serious a nature as to preclude
the possibility of the infllctor of them being
admitted to bail until a further report from the
doctor shall have been received. It is only the
solid literary merit of this verse, for instance, that

“ A C.M.G. may be a Government whip,
And swear great things, of course ;
But you don’t intend to do them,
So a lie is the truth, of course.”
We can excuse the forcible expletive here for ob-
vious reasons :—
“ But, d— it, give us good taxation.
Or else you’ll go out:
Stop this pauper emmlgration,
Or you’ll get some sour-krout.”

And Sir ’Enry will soon be back ;

We’ve wronged thee no more than the dead,
Then why inflict on us this strain ?
We’ve harmed thee not, thou dunderhead I
We know thee not, thou oakum-brain I
Oh, must we but in silence curse.
While thou, moon-calf, may’st loudly howl,
Not qualify thee for a hearse,
With one brick on thy jobbernowl ?
No ! Raise thy raven-croak on high,
Once more, and bif! will come the rock !

We like a paper that isn’t flippant, that
has an honest affection for its constituents, and
that shows it. Above all, we like a paper that
believes in its constituents; that thinks its black-
smith is the finest blacksmith that ever fought a
“boots;” that speaks confidently of the little
barrowful of blood-and-thunder literature at the
School of Arts as “ our library: ” that has a pride
in its score of constituents that pay up, and hope
in the two score that don’t. We are pretty be-
lieving and ingenuous in our way. We believed
in the innocence and guilelessness of childhood
until we heard the language of the marble club in
our lanes, and in the truthfulness and honesty
attached to temperance we were confident, until a
juvenile Templar attached to our machine-oiling
staff abstracted the boots, one morning, of one of
our dramatic critics, leaving him only the choice,
on his visit to the theatre that night, between his
football boots and a pair of snow-shoes. Uader
these circumstances, wo own we have become a
trifle sceptical. We never eat meat pies now, and
despite the landlord’s remonstrances, invariably
refuse to take an oyster that is green with passion.
Yet there was a time when wo could have been
persuaded to swallow an octopus. We own our
faults, but will strive to Improve. We will take for
example, in our struggle for amendment, the Gun-
nedah Advertiser. We have before us a sample of
its musical criticism, and we require no more than a
perusal of that to be assured that the Advertiser
brims over with the milk of human kindness.
We judge this from the whey the article is written.
It seems that some unbelievers had set forth that
nothing but “ burnt cork,” “ Box and Cox,” and
“Slocum’s Dog,” would ever get the Gunnedaites
from under their sheets of bark after sundown;
but, says the Advertiser, proudly alluding to the
chaste entertainment that had recently taken place,
‘‘ The affair of Thursday night has proved to the
contrary, and shown that the Gunnedah public can
and do appreciate good music when well rendered,
even though It is of a sentimental or sacred cha-
racter.” There are both dignity and pathos in this,
and that they should like “good music when well
rendered ” is a proof of their culture. Good music
when badly rendered would be, of course—we only
anticipate the Gunnedah critic by a week—worse
music. But, to proceed. “ The stage,” writes the
Paper, grandly, “ had been ornamented with cur-
tains,” and “ lights suspended in the centre ” shed
(or shod, is It ?) an ample glow upoa the performers;
In short, it seems that everything was on a scale of
great preparation and splendour. “Mr. Turner,” we
■re told, shortly after eight—we can’t see that what
immediately follows can be termed a very remark-
able feat, though his may be [Chutl— Ed. B.]—
“ tooK his seat at the organ,” and played the prayer
from “ Mose in Egltto” (confidently believed by the
audience to be French for Moses in Egerton) “in
a masterly manner.” The chorus sang it after-
wards, and their voices were “ well-balanced ” —
an expression which recalls to our memory, some-
how, the man on the ball at Chiarini’s. Mr. A. G.
Street then gave “ London Bridge,” but, says the
’Tiber, with critical severity, “ this song is rather
too heavy for him.” Mr. Turner then took part in
a duet, which “ elicited a well-merited round of
applause.” Mr. Turner (after one number) con-
tinues our friend, “substituted the ‘Death of
Nelson,’ for ‘Remember.’ He was encored, and
responded with * Let me Like a Soldier Fall,’ but
he sang it in too high akeyl” [Just ono glass of
iced water before we proceed.] Now, to quote
again:—“The second part was commenced by Mr.
Turner and Mr. Tilley playing a march from
‘Athalle,’by Mendelssohn, as . . . duet,” and,
to their credit, be it said, they “ were rewarded by
vociferous applause. The part song, ‘ Carnovale,’
was then rendered very pleasingly by the full
company. The song ‘Dream Faces,’ by Miss O
Thompson, was nicely sang” (sic). And subse-
quently “ God Save the Queen,” was “ well given,
and through the novelty of its rendering seemed
to quite take with the audience.” There 1 We
put down our pen, proud to think that we have
done justice to a writer who is, we are assured, no
ordinary man. We should like to know very
much what he does in his spare hours, because—
but they’re not nearly worn out yet.

A Brisbane paper called the Evangelical
something—states the following interesting cir-
cumstance respecting the Queensland Commission
of the Peace :—“We believe that (referring to a
new J.P.) his occupation when resident in the
colony was sewing up bags of ore, and that of late
he has resided out of the colony altogether while
carrying on his avocation of a tin-miner. Not
wealth, education or social standing are enjoyed
by this political J.P., who has, we are informed
not one penny of interest of any sort in Queens-
land. Another of this new batch has been twice
convicted in the Stanthorpe Police Court within
eighteen months, to say nothing of other charges
which have been withdrawn.” Why, what in
lithrofracteur is all this fuss about ? We consider
that the reference to the magistrate who sewed
up ore is one of ore-dacity. But it is only simu-
lated. These religious papers will Indulge in a
little timely pleasantry. We know they are, in
their hearts, proud of these two new J.P.’s. We
have got several we are equally proud of. We
have the one who, before he was relegated, with
other shining lights, to the congenial atmosphere
of his little shop, used to say—“ Wharsh sharge ? ’
“ Drunkenness, your Worship ? ” “ Mush (hie) do
'way shlsh short shlngl Make sample. (Consider-
inQ.) Oh (hie), Your discharged wl’ caushonsh
Nesh (hie) cashe.” There was another magistrate
who used—who didn’t know him ?—to post himself
at the pub. opposite the Police Court, and drink
long beers alike with lawyer and client. He was
a stout man, dressed in the very ghost of a black
coat, a paper collar which had invariably suc-
cumbed to the elements, and sorrow-hued pants
which hung despondently over a pair of hob-
nailed bluchers. He had a loud explosive hiccup,
a clammy hand, and eyes whose pristine bright-
ness was invariably hid by the crystal fountain of
emotion. He would take rum, biscuits, beer,
cucumbers, colonial wine, cauliflowers, shandy-
gaff, or jewellery. Any thing but a live snake.
Then, when he was loaded up, he would walk grave-
ly over and take his seat on the bench, where his
untiring efforts—Just to keep awake, and then to
turn a hiccup into a cough, were two of the eom-
pletest things ever witnessed since the building of
the Thames Tunnel and the launching of the
Great Eastern. Then there is the gorgeous “ pre-
liminary Judge,” whose place of abode is a bit un-
settled, and whoss banking account, people say,
is likewise in a trifle of a blur. We must not for-
get also that there is the delicious bootmaker, who
would at a licensing meeting announce that his
decision was made up before the case came on.
And there was—is—JOHN DAVIE3, J.P. We have
much to be proud of—much to be thankful fori

The Newcastle Herald and the News,
are having a row about stealing telegrams; and in
the course of a rather mild article called “ Satan
Reproving Sin ” occurs the following by Hanby:—
“ Since then the Penny Alfred, originally called
the Penny Samuel, after that grandest and most
uncompromising journalist Australia ever saw, has
waxed fat and now would kick.” This is sad stuff;
; and has, furthermore, a strong Melbourne smack’
The paper was never called the Penny Samuel,
because the old man died before The Bulletin
was in existence; and every name that has been
given to the News by way of a mild joke, has been
coined by us-mostly, be it said, when we felt
especially dull, or had, by courtesy to attend the
funeral of some tradesman, with whose bones we
had not the slightest sympathy. People are fond
of drawing comparisons between what the paper
was in Sam’s time, and what it is now. We’re not.
But we will admit that the old gentleman was “one
of the most remarkable men in our country. ” But

Bobby Byrne is really a daring inovation-
ist. [Why not ?] In Brisbane, he recently inter-
viewed Murdoch, a gentleman connectsd with the
! cricketing interest, and here is a sample of the
humorous dialogue that took place between them:
“ ‘I say, Figgy [11], so help my leggings, but you
are a poet.’ ‘I say, Billy, so help my spectacles,
but you are a cricketer,’ I replied. Ironically.
‘ But » 1 say, boys, what’s your opinion about Bris-
bane?’” Now, we wonder whether this is the
“ comic” literature of the present day, or is it the
“ wholesome fun” of the future ? But, though we
don’t particularly admire the style, we can still
afford to make every allowance for Little Bobby,
when it is considered that his interlocutor was a
cricketer. We had an interview with one once.
“How did you like the Orleans Club?” we en-
quired. “ Oh, flue cricket; the * break’ Spoff. got on
was a sight!” “We suppose,” we continued, “ that
you were much impressed with the art treasures
of the British Museum ?” “Oh,” cried he, “that
mouldy old hole be d dl You should have been
at the bloomin’ Oval, and seen Garrett play nine
pins with the swells’ timbers.” “The magnificent
sight of the vast concourse of people at the Derby
must have much affected you,” said we. “The
Derby oh, yes: such a lark! Coming home we
all wore false noses, and Charley hit a cove In the
eye with a pea-shooter.” “ The grandeur of the
Manchester structures—” “Ah, Manchester!
There I caught Barlow in the chains, and Bill
lifted the ball—■'* “Good-bye.” “So long, old
toucher.” And here is what Charles is supposed to
have said, in nply to the toast of his health at a
big banquet, presided over by a gentleman of
title: “Gents, — me and the boys desires to
thank you — specially the worshipful party
in the cheer for this slap up feed and the
(lost.) Cricket is oncertain — like
’orses, and Nap . That’s all; except that me
and the boys is sensitive of the honour.” As may
be expected, this eloquent address was almost as
much applauded as were some of the remarkable
feats of jugglery performed by some of the
“knights of the willow” with their knives. We
know one who called all the waiters “old feller,”
and another who always squared his arms when
fish was on, and shovelled it in with his knife.
Another objected strongly to his knife and fork
being changed after each course, so at big spreads
was having continual wrestles with the servants.
Still, great improvements have taken place in the
manners of our representatives, and few if any of
them now would shriek with astonishment at the
sight of a salt-spoon.

Mr. Booth’s valedictory anecdote in the
Melbourne Exhibition was a personal one. Had
Mr. Booth taken to the press ho would have been
as engaging a raconteur of incidents in which the
almighty Ego stood to its full height as a certain
other eminent haberdasher of literature. It is a
mercy he didn’t, for the world is, after all, a small
place, and it would be hard to find a safe retreat.
Mr. Booth says he stood one time under the dome
of St. Paul’s in London. He had In his pocket a
letter from his family begging for money. The
only other thing he possessed was Sid. But he
prayed to God, and the next morning a rich
banker sent him a cheque. This anecdote is an
invaluable legacy to the Melbourne public. It fits
many a man there. Many a man there has only
9>£d., and possesses the same kind of letter. He
can also pray like an organ. All he and such as he
want now is a Cathedral with a dome on it and a
rich banker, and then they’ll be able to tour the
world like Booth.

Glover, the temperance orator, has ar-
ranged with his wife to call his next boy “ Mel-

lad. “Melbourne Glover” is not a euphonious
combination, and, besides, it is not generous to
make the child a placard of his father's craze. But
then the question can stand over, as Mrs. Glover
may go on editing girls. Hope she will. The only

Why is the revision of the Old Testament
proceeding so slowly ? Haven’t you heard ? Well,
the fact is, that in the second chapter of Genesis

revisers have been stuck for the last year as firmly
as loafers in the Civil service. “ Spine” was pro-

Another outcome of judicial moralising!
“ There are circumstances in which a moral man,
to save his reputation, might deviate from the
strict truth.” The Melbourne Daily Telegraph
objects to this fiercely, and would have split the
dictum into meaningless letters had not the even-
ing World come to the Judge’s rescue. Here’s
how bis Honor’s subtleties arc lifted up into the
broad light in which practical men of the world
can grasp their significance:—“If a man with a
sword in his hand, intent upon killing our wife,
should inquire whether she had gone out the back
way (which she had), we should certainly answer
‘No,’ knowing that ‘Yes’ meant her immediate
death.” Now, whether was the Daily Telegraph
or the World the more recently married ? Ven-
ture to say that it is that, and not Judge Higin-
botham’s subtle dictum, which would determine
what a man would say when his wife went out the
back way.
Wonderful, indeed, are the ways of the
detective. The robbery of gold and bank-notes
from the London Chartered Bank at Horsham has
provided the D.’s with a grand opportunity for
displaying the originality of their ideas. of
their grandest Ideas was that the stolen treasure—
£500 in gold and a few bundles of notes—would
probably be buried along the bank of the Wim-
mera: simp'y shitted from one bank to another,
you see. They made diligent search at the water’s
side (a good many amateurs did the same, on their
own account, no doubt), but didn’t find the
“stuff;” still, that only speaks the more for their
originality of mind, and shows they can boast of
more advanced ideas than the culprits. They never
thought of anything more artful than keeping the
money in their pockets, very likely. By the bye,
a rumour was set afloat that the treasure had been
discovered “ concealed under a brick ” on the high
road—but it “proved to be unfounded.” 8o we
should imagine.
Now, who was it that told Mr. Speight all
about the people of Ballarat? He is not long
enough in that quarter to pick up much in the
usual way. Perhaps he had had a talk with Bishop
Thornton in the old land, who cadged about the
hat for the poor miners. Or, perhaps he stood
near and saw the moral wreck which Ballarat has
made of the once gallant Majah. At all events, he
won’t take a bite or a sup from the people of that
city. Having business last week, he notified that
he would go up there. “Now is the time,’ cried
the Major; “come on, my merry men, and we’ll
feed him and fill him as full as a lord.” And
banners were got ready, and tablecloths washed
and ironed, and everybody went about saying
“ Now's the time!” It s not plain what the cabal-
istic phrase meant, but when Mr. Speight heard it
he knocked the citizens dumb with amazement.
“What I'll eat and drink will be at my own ex-
pense, and I’ll take nothing from you. Ballarat
can’t understand it.
One of the dominant rules of the Salva-
tion Harmy seems to be the utter prohibition of
the presence of “terbaccer” at their fanatic
howls. A party who essayed “ a chew ” at a late
meeting in the Protestant Hall was violently as-
sailed, and an uproar ensued that rendered the ’all
a very pandemonium. At last the “bobbies”
stepped in, and the holy rioters were quieted.—
Oh I you mustn’t “ chaw terbaccer,”
Else we’ll wipe you on the “smacker,”
Is the howl of the great Harmy of Salvation ;
For the only thing to chew here
Is the bosh we yell to you here.
Or we’ll kick you straight out into cold damna-
tion.
For we “Hallelujah Lasses,”
Ah, we Christianize the masses,
With our drums and tambourines pell-mell;
And, if our shrill “Hallelujah”
From “terbaccer’ doesn’t “slew yer,”
Why, you just can hook it straight to h—11
He’s dead now, but once (when he was alive)
be started a country paper, and one of the para-
graphs of the prospectus ran as follows:—“ It will
be especially our aim to allow the utmost latitude
to our fellow-townsmen with respect to Inserting
communications in the paper. Indeed, we shall
court rather than shirk favours of this kind.”
Well, he came out all right; and, in good time for
the next issue, the Mayor came round armed with
an article urging the Government to at once com-
mence the block bridge at Tuigog's Creek, follow-
ing up with a slight dissertation upon the most
skilful way of stacking lucerne, and concluding
with a passionate and learned essay upon hog-
rearing. “Put that there In the papper,” said his
Worship. The editor gazed blankly at the huge
MS:, saw before him a sea of trouble in setting and
revising it, when what he considered a (bright
thought struck him. “Sir,” he said, “I grieve
I cannot insert your article. I have only been
four weeks in the district, and -how am I to know

Judging from appearances, many a man
could do far worse than take board and lodgings
for a few years’ stretch in the Bathurst Hospital.
According to a local journal. “ There are 31
patients, and the expenses for the last month
amounted to £175. The place is crowded with
nurses, housemaids, charwomen, laundresses,
cooks, porters, &c.” A more salubrious spot could
not be fouud in the Western district, and the style
of table kept may be imagined from the fact that
during the past month the poor emaciated, dying
Satients put themselves outside of “50 fowls, 73
ozen eggs, 74® of butter, and fruit of all kinds.
Including grapes at 1s. per lb.,” in addition to the
coarser, plebeian food, such as Orange-killed beef.
Vale Creek pork, and prize mutton. At least, if
the patients didn’t, who did ? That’s the question
which is just now agitating the breast of Alderman
Paul, who furthermore wants to know, you know,
what in thunder a crowd of semi-corpses want
with olives, Parmesan cheese, and old port wine.
All the patients apparently suffer very much from
consumption—consumption of victuals, we mean.
Swagsmen must keep away from Mel-
bourneandits suburbs. The old civilisation, which
permitted a man to carry his bedding on his back
and to stretch himself where he pleased, has given
place to the regime ef a bluestone lockup and heap
of malodorous straw. James Hayes was seen at

bobby, “what for is that man humping that
blanket ? Shtole it, I believe. Hi! me man, come

out, said James; “I bought it in the shop for-
nlnst ye, and am going up country.” The bobby,
finding the statement true, pulled on his white
gloves and let James go his way. In a couple of
hours James got as far as Melbourne. “Where
are ye going with that garment ?” asked another
bobbyshtole it, I believe. Come’long.” “Gar-

Up Hughenden way there resides a distin-
guished citizen who keeps a shanty where no liquor
is over wasted. When customers don’t roll up f:st

occasionally gets shook out bad. So he has to hie

There are many methods for restoring to good
humour men who return home with tilted noses

is to chase his wife round trees and wallop her
with a horse-halter. By the time there are wheals
on her shoulders as thick as a walking-stick, his
moroseness is worked off, and he is set up for the
day. Do we pity her ? We smile. We’ve often
wished to be a woman and married to a shanty-
keeper. When he came along with the horse-
halter would we skip round trees or dodge round
corners ? Not much. But there’s one thing we’d
guarantee The ol’man might pursue us once,
overtake us, and even reduce us to pulp, but—not
rue second time—no. never again. Oh! woman-
woman. You’ve a lot to answer for. It is to pro-
iect you we have to run up the gallows and the
triangles, because—you won’t protect yourselves,
wm you never change, and by the change, put an
«ud once for all to the clenched fist, the stick, and
the horse-halter ?
P® 6 ’ 8 a rather peculiar sort of a case
A 8 £. lviD ff trouble just now down Dunedin
of ur i Dg a . rece °t gale a chimney on the top
rhsoir wo " s t°rey house, belonging to a man named
*fotir er V was blown down on the roof of a ono-
ewfju h ° U8e - the property of a God-fearing
hrowT e J_der named Biles, and, crashing through,
innw l l ? eap °? furniture, and gave three of the
eses the appearance of having been ac-
thoiir Uy overtaken by an active sawmill. Before
? chimney was perfectly sound. Biles
nlasto^i hls b 9use first, and then had the children
after V. 1 £ he y were nearly as good as new,
Broth^ h h u o e handed in a bill for £47 10. to
othei Chalker. Brother Chalker, however
couldn’t see It, and in a most convincing Spetech,
which proved his great acquaintance with the
Scriptures, pointed out that he was not liable, as
the damage was done by the tempest raised by
God ; that the w iys of PfoVldence are inscruta-
ble, that the Lord smote his servant Job
with boils and. dungheaps. And that it was fiat
blasphemy to fly in the Creator's face for a paltry
£4f 10s. This made Biles mad—he was about to say
Job me—when a holier spirit seized him, and, catch-
ing Chalker by the hair, he Professor-Millered him
round the yard for halt an hour, at the end of
which time the Bible expounder looked like a man
who had called an eight-horse thrashing machine
a condemned liar. And now both the elders have
taken the law on each other —one for damage done
by a i chimney, and the other for ’sault and battery,
we therefore see that even Providence occasion-
ally causes trouble in the best regulated families.
The Melbourne press is indulging in some
very angry surprise because Mr. Call, the figure-
head of the blind goddess that rules the City
Court, decided a case last week according to his
lights. An old woman named Robinson had been
out a trifle late one night, and going into a pub.
l^.,F°f res^men^8 ’ allowed a fellow named
Willis to pay for her glass of ale. Willis accom-
panied her out, and when they came to a lonely
Place a great row ensued. The row lasted while a
policeman ran a quarter of a mile—which, on the
face of it, proves that it must have been going on
for the better part of a fortnight. When he
arrived and got his wind, he found Willis with bis
knee on the woman’s chest, and his hands round
her neck choking her. He “ disjined thim and tuk
thjm to the lock-up. Charge against Willis,
Assault with Intent to rob.” \villis pleaded “The
woman was trying to rob me.” Evidence: The
constable heard her cries a quarter of a mile off;
she was bleeding from the ears and frothing at the
mouth; she had to be doctored wheh she reached
the lock-up; her throat still showed the bruises.
No contra evidence to all this. Mr. Call said, “ I
dismiss the case; there’s nothing to support the
charge.” Hence the surprise. But, looking over
the general administration of justice, it doesn’t
appear that there is any special reason for having
Mr. Call interrogated by the Government. If, on
the evidence tendered, he had given the old woman
three months’ hard labour, the matter might claim
further consideration. But ho didn’t. He let her
off. She may count herself lucky that justice was
bllijd, or She ridlglit bo to-day In gaol for her noise
en that night.
The committee of the Melbourne Benevo-
lent Asylum has decided, by a majority of six to
four, to permit card-playing as a recreation in that
institution. This is, indeed, a glorious privilege
for the poor old played-outs and dead-teats of the
sister colony. But why put in the proviso that
they shall only play for recreation ? Did the com-
mittee, in its deliberative wisdom, think that the
impecunious old fossils, who are admitted as
paupers, were possessed of cash, and, if card-
plaving were allowed, would “ready up” packs
and go in for gambling and attendant dissipation ?
But, perhaps the committee acted judiciously in
making the restriction. Somebody says somewhere
that every man is at heart a gambler, only wanting
the opportunity to develop the science. “The
means to do ill deeds make ill deeds done;” and
now thattheantlquated inhabitants of the Asylum
have got the cards, the latent spirit of specula-
tion will again assert Itself, and a wild and reckless
course of gambling must be the Inevitable result.
They will start with a harmless game of all-fours,
for “love,” and gradually drift into the mysteries
of whist and eribbage; then by a natural transi-
tion to “forty-fives” and euchre, and ultimately
And themselves settled down to a “school of
poker.” And when it comes to poker, there will
be some exciting scenes. “I’ll go a chaw o’
tibaky,” one old veteran will yell out. “ I’ll ’see ’
you the chaw and go two plpe-fulls better,” cries
the next. “I’ll straddle it,” shrieks a third. “I’ll
see your straddle and ‘raise’it a shirt,” excitedly
says the dealer. “I’ll go a waistcoat and two
feeds,” screams number two, “and It’ll take you
a suit of clothes to ‘call’ me.” And so these
ancient revellers will have a right good time, only
we reckon some of the less fortunate ones will
have to lie abed at times after gambling away their
clothes.

as to whether Mr. A. Lee
will adhere to the state-
ment made by him at the
termination of last season
that he and racing had
parted company, but we
can set them at rest by
stating, wo have it on
good au thority, that Lee’s
resolution only related to
handicaps, and that he
will start in champion and
scratch races during the
coming season.
Mr. R. Howie has
sold Suwarrow to Mr.
Daniels, of Bellerine.
Says “Augur:” “I am
astonished that some of
our leading breeders did
not secure thii son of
Snowden, for he had cre-
dentials of the very flrst
class, possessing an un-
blemished pedigree, with
the additional recom-
mendation of great per-
formances, having won
the Y.R.O. Derby, run
third tor the Melbourne
Cup. and on the last day
of tho V.H.C. meeting
won the Mares’ Produce
Stakes and Canterbury
Plate, beating 1 he cham-
pion, First King, in the
latter race. Yet we see
some of our breeders
using wretches that are
not fit to carry Suwar-
row’s blankets to exer-
cise; and they complain
that so many racing men
go to Sydney to purchase
yearlings.”
On Saturday last the Water Nymph,
scratch; FJoetwing, train.; and Corophenc and
Dag mar, each 8min., started for a handicap sweep-
race tor half-decked boats of over 20-feet
belonging to Berry’s Bay, over a course from the
San Francisco mall steamers’ buoy In Lavender
Bay, round the R.S Y.8. buoy at Manly and back
rn Starting noint. The Water Nymph drew away
early in the race, and finished 9min. ahead of the
Fleetwing, the field coming in some minutes later.
We have received a note—not a bank one,
worse luck-from “ Buncum,” who ridicules our
publishing a yarn about Hanlan that has been
going the rounds of the papers. Now, if we make
no mistake—and, of course, we never do— Bun-
cum,” under aaotker wm~de-plume, a couple of
weeas ago sent ns a three sides of foolscap account
of a subuiban cricket match, which we boiled
down to a line and a half for our” Gleanings. No
doubt “ Buncum ” thought his cricket match
: might well have taken 6b© place of the Hanlan
yarn; but wo don’t. We prefer good retails to
i original drivel.

Yesterday morning’s mail conveyed to us
the intelligence that Mr. John T. M'fnnes, the well-
known farming and pastoral reporter tor the
Australasian and the Sydney Mail, had for-
saken literature, in which he has at all times
shown so conspicuously, tor the more promising
and encouring occupation in conjunction with
other gentlemen of “ commission merchant and
pastoral agent.” Messrs. John M'Jnnes and Oo.
are now carrying on business at 36, O’Connell-
street, opposite the 8. M. Herald ollice, and the
firm has every prospect of success, trum the fact
that Mr MTnnes has travelled far and wide, visit-
ing remote parts in all the colonies. His face
must be familiar at every town where a pastoral
show is held, and a more acute judge of a horse,
sneep, or cattle we do not know than the head of
this new firm. The teim commission merchants
and pastoral agents would appear to imply from
the circular before us that the firm will be pre-
pared to transact the following business:—The
purchase of all descriptions of pastoral plant,
squatting supplies, and the various classes ot
engineering appliances, harve-ting machinery,
agricultural implements, mining requisites, <Sc.
Importers and manufacturers invoices will be
forwarded direct to their constituents, who in no
instance will be charged commission for buying.
The attention of sheep farmers, graziers, and
others is specially called to the pastoral agency
business, in connection with which the sile or
Furchase on commiss on ot puro-bred stock will
orm a prominent feature, No man Is moio cap-
able of piloting a now firm like this to success than
Mr. MTnnes, who has our best wishes.— Wagqa

The resumed match between the Carthona
and Conservative C.C., lor the Junior Cup, resulted
in an easy win for the Carthonas, by an innings
and one run, the scores being: Conservatives, 46
and 84 respectively; Carthonas, 131 in their first
innings. The Osbornes and Croydons at once fol-
lowed on, and live of the Osbornes’ wickets were
disposed of for 58 runs.
For the Sydney Amateur Sailing Club 20-
feet and under half-decked handicap, on Saturday
last, the following boats put in an appearance:
Zephyr (7 min.), lanthe (4 min.), and Wingadee
(scratch). The Wingadee finished only two minutes
ahead of the lanthe, so the litter counted first
place. The Zephyr finished twelve minutes and a
half behind the lanthe.
Young Gough’s finish on Little Sister for
the Autumn Handicap last Saturday week was one
of the best displays at tbe R.C. meeting. The
patience with which he lay off while Here’s Luck
appeared to be fairly “running away” with the
race, and the rattle with which he landed the filly
in front of Mr. Forrester’s horse at the finish,
were 1'mdly praised—by losers as well as winners.
An insignificant seotisn of the rough
element, made an attempt to “goose ” Hales as he
returned to scale with Martini on Saturday week,
Put a burst of cheering soon silenced the hostile
demonstration. It was this little proof of the
“insincerity of tho mob,” probably, which pro-
voked from a sarcastic “bookie” the remark: “I
suppose the ‘ Hales backers ’ are quite disgusted.
He's got beaten!"
John Blauchfleld. a labouring man, played
tho thimble and pea trick at the Fiemington races
last week. Collared. 14s. 81, in his pocket. Mr.
0«I1 “ lectured tho prisoner severely on the enor-
mity of his offence, and sentenced him to seven
days’ imprisonment.” Hear, hear! Had ho gone
to the Grand-stand and netted thousands by a
trick not much dissimilar he would have had a
chance fora C M.G.-ship. There, there I
A meeting of representatives of athletic
clubs was held at the 6xford Hotel on Friday night
for the purpose of considering what steps should
be taken towards raising a memorial to the late
Mr. J. E. Raper, when a committee consisting of
Messrs. J. A. Brodie, H. Roberts, C. Tange, J. J.
Allen, B. P. t-impson, 8. Chapman, and F. Burkett
was appointed to invite subscription, and decide
upon the form the memorial should take.
At Sandhurst (Vic.) onr late lively visitor,
M. Victor, again belied his name in a wrestling
match with Thomas of Baglehawk (Vic) The
were £35 a side, the best of three falls—one
in the Gncco-Roman, one in the mixed, and the
third to bo tossed for. Victor won the Graeco-
Thomas the mixed, and the toss for tho final,
which he decided should be ‘Huggie,” or Cum-
berland and Westmoreland style. Victor had no
show at this stylo, and Thomas threw him at once.
The Victoria Amateur Turf Club were
not favoured with flue weather for their meet on
Saturday last, but tbe attendance was very good
notwithstanding. Wesbury beat Anagram by a
length and a half for the Selling Race, Leperello
third ; Vanguard made rather an easy win of the
Handicap Hurdle Race, Don Alonzo second, On-
tario third; Matua started at 3 to 1 for the Oak-
leigh Handicap, and won by a length and a-half
from Victress, Duenna third. Bohemian easily
defeated Percival for the Criterion Stakes, Sheela
third; Governor won the Handicap Steeplechase
as he liked from Moonlight, Blackthorn third; and
Camerine finished a length away from Black Dia-
mond for the South Yarra Handicap, Waterloo
third.
At the closing night of the Miller-Foley
combination in Melbourne, Foley and Farnan;had
a little misunderstanding, which resulted in a
lively bit of play between the pair. Foley evi-
dently lost his temper, and in response to a bit of
“ chivvy” from a gentleman in the audience, cried
out that “he or anyone else was quite welcome to
come on the stage and have a try.” Parnan has
flown into the columns of the Melbourne Sports-
man, and states Before we went to spar, he
(Foley) said not to feint and go driving with my
right hand, but have a lively go in. I said I would
not attempt to hit hard, unless he commenced. I
did not do so until he let go. Even then I did not
hit him as hard as I could have done, he closing
me and holding my right arm.” The Cabbage
Garden now want* to go with our own Larry in
right down earnest.
The Prince of Wales has entered his horse,
The Scot, in his own royal name, for the Grand
National Steeplechase at Liverpool, and other
races; so it may be presumed that H R.H. will
figure publicly as an owner of racehorses during
the approaching season. Hitherto, an occasional
“ nomination ” has been the extent of his ostensible
patronage to racing stakes, though he undoubtedly
has had a partial—if not tho entire—interest in
many horses entered by his friends. The Prince’s
first “nomination,” if wo remember rightly, was
tor the Goodwood Cup of some fifteen years ago,
and the horse thus honoured belonged to Sir John
(then Colonel only) Astley. As “ Wales’ ” brother-
in-law, the Czar of Russia, is likely to have several
nags running in England this year, “the turf”
ought to be well patronised by tuft-hunters. Let
us hope that royalty will “ run straight.”
Professional rowing in England has re-
ceived what should surely prove its quietus, for
the present, at any rate. Wallace Ross, who suc-
cumbed to our own Elias over the Thames Cham-
pionship course, has actually conceded to George
Bubear a start of ten seconds, la a match over tho
same course, and defeated him by six lengths.
This is the more remarkable, seeing that Bubear
recently defeated Elliott with great ease, for what
was grandiloquently termed the “Championship
of England,” after Elliott had been brought over
from the States as a “much improved man.”
Elliott's backer could hardly have been very ’cute,
er he would have contrived to get some sort of
I'no between Wa'lace Ross and the burly “pit-
man,” before taking him across the Atlantic
Rowing—as a profession—has sunk very low, in-
deed, at “nomc,” and until it ie taken up by men
of better social standing than its present “pro-
fessors,” la likely to remain at about the same
level as pedestriauism. Several of the beet expo-
nents of both, in England, are rather closely con-
nected with the criminal classes
We have seen the redoubtable Hanlan, and
we still live. Ned is not half a bad-looking follow,
yet scarcely the Adonis that photographs and Yan-
kee writers would have us believe. Mr. Hunt had
a room set aside for the Champion at the Oxford
Hotel, and a drag waited for him at the Circular
Quay; but Hanlau rather upset nutters by laud-
ing somewhere down Erskino-street way, and go-
ing quickly up to Petty 's, where he intends to put
up-so that we guess Boss Hunt rather anticipated
the incubator. Hanlan showed up at the Oxford
on Saturday night, and addressed the crowd from
the balcony to tho effect that he had paid all his
own expenses out, and in! ended to have a look
round betore binding himself to a match. The
" jaynil Dan” was there, of course, and indulged
in a flowery oration from which we gleaned that
the man who is not a professional sculler is not fit
to live. We shall, no doubt, soon have an oppor-
tunity of Bering Hanlan row; but he has been ad-
vertised to such an extent,' and so much will be
expected of him. that the general public will most
likely be dlsaj po nted in the exhibition. There
can be no doubt that Hanlan’s sculling is more
effective than that of any man cf his day, but we
fancy it would take good judges of rowing to dis-
tinguish anything more finished in style than that
which Trickett used to treat us to in his palmy
days.
Martini-Henry’s collapse in the “ Cham-
pion” was not such a great surprise to many who
noticed how he “blew” after nis victory in the
Leger, on the preceding Saturday, and moreover
his gaJlop w ith Morpeth on the Tuesday morning
was anything but satisfactory. The “ early birds ”
were of opinion that Morpeth, with Hales up,
completely pumped out Martini, carrying a far
lighter weight in their trial spin. Morpeth, cei-
tamly, subsequently won the Australian Cup witu
tolerable ease; but the time (4miu. 3%seo.) was not
Quite as good as Navigator’s time lor last year.i
•Navigator, as a three-year-old, had only two
pounds in the saddle than Morpeth, as a feur-
year-old; therefore, according to the touts’ esti-
mate of the Tuesday morning’s gallop, the “ great
gun ” was not, last week, up to tho form of Navi-
gator at the corresponding time last year—on
paper, at any rate One or two of the “books,”
too, who managed to get a look at Martini in tho
paddock, just before the “Champion” was run,
were strongly impressed with the Idea that ho had
gone “off” since winning the Leger, and fielded
pretty strongly in consequence. That Martini,
tolling hopelessly la the rear of Lo Grand and Off
Colour, was the same animal that had led the same
pair such a merry dance only a week before, seems
Impossible to believe; more strange still, Le Grand
ran, on (hat occasion, essentially like a non-stayer,
for after looking like giving the "crack” some
trouble, as the horses came down tho straight, he
dropped away again as though from Jack of
stamina. Off Colour, on the other hand, certainly
ran more like a slicker in the Leger than the horse
who subsequently defeated him so cleverly in the
three-mile event. The glorious uncertainty of
the turf was never better exemplified than at the
late V.R.C. meeting.

took place at Nitbsdale last Friday evening, when
about 100 ladies and gentlemen attended Pl d e “y

butterfly bachelors, who on this occasion
were all desirous of Indulging in the giddy dance.
The bachelors showed great judgment in their
invites, as the ladles Present represented i lomeof
tha flower of Sydney beauty. About .» o ciock
the Mayor entered the ball-room, and an extra

The unmarried ladies of Armidale have
their hands full at present, working up a Spinsters
UaII which being the first of the kind there, is
nRusimr almost as much dust as the big Railwaj
baUflast year? At their first meeting, letters were
read from one or two young ladies, declining to
co-operate in the proposed ball on the plea which
is dubiously regarded —that * it is an indelicate
thing for a lady to invite a gentleman to a ball.”
But those modest prudes must, or should, know
that although it’s ostensibly given by the young
ladies, the old ones arc behind the scenes sustain-
ing the chief characters, but don t appear in the
-p. The invitations are numerous, and about -00
ffuests expected. The secretaryship is in the hands
of two competent young ladies (local), and ftona

A very pleasant time was spent at Glebe
Heights onthel2thinst., the event beingthe birth-
day of Master and Miss Sullivan, 3 years and 1 year
old respectively. Alter tea, a well-laden Chrlst.-
mas-treo proved a great surprise to the little ones.
Presents for all the guests were found upon it.
A table well covered with gilts to the hero and
heroine of the day showed that they had not been
forgotten. After the tree came dancing; and as
the little ones departed, bigger ones arrived,
amongst which were two sisters In blue muslin
trimmed with white lace, blue satin waistbands
and silver ornaments. A pretty bride elect was
there in cream and cardinal. A cousin of the
hosted wore navy satin skirt with old gold and
navy-striped redingote.

■A most delightful dance was given by
Mrs Dr Bassett, at her residence, Russell-street,
Bathurst, on Thursday evening, the 6th March.
A great many assembled with the full int ent
of enjoying themselves, which every one did
thoroughly- Miss Scarr, in a delicate pink nun s
veilingitrimmed with brocaded satin and pansies,
looked charming, and was decided y the belle of
Th#, evening. There were several other pretty
dresses? amongst which was that of Mias Macin-
tosh being a pink trimmed with the same coloured
m»t; Miss Machattks looked very well in light blue,
also xiiss Lee in black. Some of the ladies
dancing was much admired, Miss Scarr carrying
off the palm for waiting among the ladies, and
among the beaux a fair-haired assistant from the
Waterworks. The party broke up about balf-past
two we won’t say with what consequences, »s we
know one or two matches were made during the
evening. # „
“Sock and buskin to the rescue!’’ An
entertainment was given in the Town Hall, leter-
sham, on the 12th instant, by the members of the
Lytton Club, for the benefit of the Petersham
Owls, the object being to defray the cost of a pro-
scenium and various improvements desired
by the latter. From the appearance of the hall
it was evident that much had been done already,
considerable taste having been displayed in the
erection of the proscenium; and by the time tne
nest is feathered to the liking of the jolly birds
who are to occupy it, there will be little left to
suggest in the way of improvements. The Pro-
ceedings were initiated by apt speeches from the
ox-Mayor and Mayor-elect, who seemed to be good
friends of the Club, and the first number, “ -Thou
art so near,” by Mr. J. Callaghan, set the ball a-
rolllng. Mr. Callaghan’s voice sounded with good
effect: he is evidently untroubled with nervous-
ness, the bane of young singers—and were he only
to coax his voice, not strain it, we might expect
to shut oureyes and listen with delight, in the days
to come, while he warbles to us something a little
bit more rekerky than “ Beloved Star.’ The reci-
tation, “ Papa's Letter.” was given in a good, con-
fident style by Mr. B. Palmer, and the classic II
Bacio ’’ of Arditl was beautifully rendered by Mrs.
Arthur Wood. The two next items on the pro-
gramme were struck out, owing to the absence «f
Signor Giaramona and Miss Hastings, the (breach
being admirably Ailed by Mr. Slocum, who brought
down the house with “ Shamus O Brlen. The
first part of the programme finished with The
angel at the window,” sung by Miss Simpson, a
lady whose pleasing performance well merited the
applause it received. Byron's three-act comedy,
“Old Soldiers,” followed, and was on the whole
creditably rendered, the chief fault being the usual
delay in picking up the cue. Amateurs who may
be all that can be desired in other respects, fre-
Thus: —Angelina: I cannot bear it I Oh, Edwin,
canyou believe —” (interval of five minutes, to
give the prompter a show). Edwin: Believe that
you have deceived me, Angelina? |Yes, by
heaven.’ ” and tio on, hand passibus cequis. If
anv selection may be made. Miss Lovett as Mary
Mom, and Mr. fcfdwin Palmer as Lionel Leveret,
might be mentioned as most at hotxie in their
Dirts The fair impersonators of Mrs. Major Mess
and Miss Kate M’Tavish were successful m pleasing
the audience; as were also Mr. Walter■
(Malor Fang), Mr. B. Palmer (Captain M Tavish),
Mr. Goldie Hunt (Corporal Cassidy—and a very
good corporal, too), and Mr. Henry Irving (?) as
p 0 dgar. Of the gentleman who took the character
of Gordon Lockharl, the only thing to be said is
that it didn’t suit him. Nothing could have been
more gratifying than the attendance with which
the Club was lavoured, the hill bsmg crowded
with a stylish throng of visitors various
parts. It was dilhcult in such an audience to
descry many laces; but wc could see Mr. Koseberry,
the late member, evidently in g/eat good humour,
Mr. and Mrs. Hughes, Mr.and Mrs. ora Kennedy,
Mr. and Mrs. Hyland, Mr. Pearce, Messrs. E. K.
Halloran and J. C. Fisher and their wives, Mr. and
Mrs. Cnbitt, and other well-known faces, beverai
Melbourne belles figured amongst the audience, m
very becoming attire. A lady from forest Lodge
wore cardinal figured satin trimmed with lace, the
skirt being fluted and of crushed-strawberry hue.
Black figured satin trimmed with cream lace
enhanced the charms of a Marnckville lady.
A pale blue cashmere dress, with black satin
body and similar trimmings, was answerable
for many heart-burnings, we fear; and when we
yearn to do justice to two pretty girls from over
the water, in black figured satin, lace trimmed,
and hair d la Chinoise. words fail us. Many effective
gream costumes adorned fair visitors from the
city and suburbs, and there was
of pretty pale blue "conceptions, with lace and
satin trimmings. Notice must n ®tke o“ itte d <->£
the dresses worn by the lady amateura. Miss
Lovett appeared in a very effective figured muslin,
having anAesthetic flower nestling just below the
shoulder, a wide-awake hat complying the cos-
tume; and this gave place to a maixe Madras
muslin dress with scarlet s^ 188
M'Cracken wore a costume suitable to the elderly
part undertaken by that lady; and Miss Braves,
as Kate M’Tavish, deserved her conquests black
satin de Lyon walking costume a , nd a velvet poke
bonnet, having a bewitching pink feather up
forward.” . *

Mr. Robert Forsyth, the well-known
tanner, was picnicked on Wednesday last, prepara-
tory to his leaving th» colony on atrip to t Europe.
This kind of festivity is deservedlv popular, and
affords affectionate friends an opportunity of
totally deranging your nervous system, so that you
may be able to more effectually enjoy the agonies
of sea-sickness, and think of them when far away.
Correy’s Gardens, Botany, was selectedthe scene
of the gathering, and thither nr. Forsyth and his
friends repaired at an early heur. dancing being
indulged in until luncheon time. The proceedings
wore eniivemd by a large contingent of the fair
sex, amongst whom some very presentable dresses
were noticeable. One young lady, from the city,
who appeared to command the lions
attention, was most tastefully a tt‘f
hucd nun’s veiling, with a Henri II. hat adorned
by natural flowers. Two young girls In what
appeared to be white tarletan, sisters probably,
wore much admired, as also was a George-street
syren in a showy costume of mauve cashmere.
Those who were not too self-engrossed to respond
to the magic summons of luncheon, sat down to a
comfortable meal under the presidency of Mr.
Abigail, M.L.A., Mr. Andrew Moore having the
vice-chair. The customary toasts were drunk, and
a white elephant was presented to Mr. Forsyth by
the chairman on behalf of the subscribers.

The Protestant Hall was brilliant with gas
and many coloured dresses on Wednesday night,
on the occasion of the Sydney Owl Club Hyginx,
which passed off delightfully. There was a large
gathering—about 7n0—who were lavish in their
applause to the performers. Mr. Caddy, the presi-
dent of the club, has a happy knack of making
tilings pleasant; and Mr. Clarke, Mr. Huenerbem,
and Mr. Ponder, made Ponder-ous exertions to
make the hoot a success. A good concert always
is enjoyable; it is ever pleasant to hear good
music. Yellowhammer sang “Thou art so near,
while Signor Vittorini gave, in grand style, Alla
Stella Contldente.” Madame Marius trilled “The
Milkmaid,” in a pretty voice. A piano duet, by
Mr. M'Quade and Lyre Bird, caused the piano to
sing brilliantly. Perhaps the song “There is
another row down stairs” gave most fun. But
one of the gems of the evening was the violin
solo, from “Norma,” by Herr Franclk, which was
greatly applauded. After the concert came
dancing, about 300 remaining to indulge in the
dreamy valse, to the music of Mr. D© Groen,
whose playing everyone likes. Now was the time
to admin the dresses. A Woollahra blonde, in
flowered pink silk polonaise, skirt of nun's veil-
ing, made conquests, while a stately
glorious eyes, wore cream Indian muslin. Prom
Elizabeth-street came a little brunette, in Scotch
plaid toilette. A cardinal satin dress was shown
to advantage by Miss Kurts. A Melbourne belle
donned black satin ; the wife of the secretary,
peacock-green satin. We would like to mention
all the dresses, but we were so dazzled by seeing so
many pretty faces, that it was impossible to think
of dress. Two o’clock saw the finish, but before
that time, refreshments provided by the club
were partaken of.
(For continuation of Social, see next page.)
Milk-white veiling and silk gauze to match, with sprigs of
cherries embroidered in red and bronze, are employed to
make up this youthful toilette, distinguished by elegant grace-
ful simplicity. A voile kilting wide, above which is a ,

In social circles just at present the subject
of titles is often referred fo—partly in connection
tifith the rumoured appointment of Lord Reay to
the Governorship of Victoria, and partly, perhaps,
a natural outcome of the large amount of talk
that has arisen anent: he titular distinction of the
well-known Baron Maclay. The latter gentleman
has earned for himself a high name in the scientific
world, and his services to the community at large
should render him independent of such considera-
tions as are involved in the possession or non-
possession of a trumoery title. It is a mistake that
is commonlv made—but none the less a mistake —
to imagine that it is easy to pirate a Russian title.
That nation has an official hierarchy comprehend-
ing some 800,000 members, all privileged to style
themselves barine, or lord. But thin number,
though seeming large, only forms a small fraction
among the many million subjects of the Czar, and
every Russian knows whether his titled country-
man derives the dignity from a princely or
baronial family. This, however, refers to lords of
the soil: with ephemeral titles conferred through
other sources the true Slav will trouble himself
little. Baron Reay, who has been referred to
above, is the representative of a time-honoured
Scottish peerage, and a descendant of Angus Don
Mackay, leader of the Mackays of Strathnalrn,
who was slain on Flodden field. The house of
Reay supported Charles the First and his son with
characteristic loyalty; but, unlike most of the
adherents of that noble pair, the Reays emerged
from the struggle unstripped of their belongings,
and have continued to hold a leading position
among the county families of Great Britain. A
singular circumstance in connection with this
house is the number of representatives who have
died childless, the effect being observed in the
descent of the title by many tortuous windings
from brother to brother and cousin to cousin
down to the present holder—Baron Reay.

Mr. and Mrs. Shearston gave a social even-
ing at the Club House, 255 Pitt-street, on Tuesday
last, to the ship’s company of H.M.S. Miranda.
The entertainment provided by this popular
couple passed off most enjoyably, their hospitality
being probably all the more acceptable to the blue-
jackets because that it was confined to social en-
joyment and contained none of the Chadband
element. The indispensable tea having been
attacked in the large saloon on the first floor, the
decks were cleared and harmony was the order of
the night. Mr. Shearston gave the men, in hearty
terms, a welcome back to Sydney. Captain Ack-
land followed with a few well-chosen words,
eulogising the feeling which had assisted to pro-
mote the evening s amusement; and several songs
and recitations succeeded. The efforts of the
vocalists were much appreciated by the Jack-tars,
especially when an opportunity occurred for the
exercise of their stentorian tones in a rattling
chorus. To hear “ Our Jack’s come home to-day ”
framed in a seaman's chorus, was real good for the
blues. Miss Lily Clarke played several selections,
and also officiated as accompanist. Among the
visitors were Mrs. and the Misses Hale, Miss Pen-
nell, the Rev. W, Blunt, Cautaln Ackland, Drs.
Barry and Fisher, and Mr. Tucker. The Miranda
is under orders to proceed en an early cruise
among the islands, so that the welcome is almost a
good-bye.

Accounts reach us of a garden party given
on the 2nd inst., by the popular Victorian Baronet,
Sir W. J. Clarke, and Lady Clarke, at Rupertswood,
Sunbury. The house and grounds were thronged
by upwards of 500 visitors from town and country.
Rare plants and flowers were lavishly displayed to
increase the beauty of the surroundings, and sweet
■trains of music greeted the ear. The accepted
ladles of fashion were present in all the pageantry
of novel and stylish costumes, conspicuous among
thein being the wife of a Toorak millionaire, in a
lovely combination of velvet and satin. Sydney
was represented by a lady from Upper William-
street, attirtd in a skirt of maize tulle with a
brilliant Mazarin silk body. A lovely dress was of
geranium-coloured nun’s veiling decorated with
sprays of white rose and lilies of the valley. Mrs.
Armytage wore a grey tarletan flecked with silver
spots, relieved by a knot of vivid flowers worn at
the breast. Mrs. Malllson was attired in some well-
fitting claret-coloured material, scattered over the
surface of which were tiny groups of raised flowers
on a plain ground. A young lady in cashmere and
silk, displayed under one of the new Henri II.
hats a face of singular beauty, and bore with
graceful composure the admiring contemplation
of a thousand eyes.

Mr. W. H. Paling was entertained at Clon-
tarf on Saturday last, the occasion being a compli-
mentary banquet and picnic given to that gentle-
man, previously to his departurejfor Europe, by
Mr. J. P. Starling, of Norwood Hall, Petersham.
About 70 gentlemen, including all the employes of
Mr. Paling, assembled at Lime-street Wharf,
where the steam launch, Mary, was in readiness to
convey the party to the ground. A magnificent
dinner had been prepared in Compagnoni’s best
style; and after satisfying the appetite, the usual
loyal toasts were drunk, and Mr. Starling
proposed the health of the guest in a dainty
little speech, referring to Mr. Paling's well-known
generous and amiable disposition. Mr. Paling
appropriately responded, and was then presented
by Mr. F. P. Pines, on behalf of the employes, with
a unique and very massive gold quartz albert,
and a case containing four pairs of gold mounted
spectacles. Several other toasts, including “ The
Host,” were honoured, and the party turned their
attention to cricket and other sports until dark,
when all safely returned to town after spending a
most enjoyable day.
* ♦ ♦
Not a single M.P. was to be seen spreading
his smiles at Botany last Thursday, at the Book-
sellers’ and Stationers’ picnic. There could not have
been any free tickets. Poor M.P.’s, what is the
country coming to? However, the booksellers
seemed quite happy without them. The booksellers
hit out in the way of prizes, as they presented tro-
phies to be competed for to the value of £V0. We did
not think there was so much money in the world.
The banquet, by F. Smith, was in his usual liberal
style. Mr. C. E. Fuller in the chair, and as the
speeches were very short, the young ladles had all
the more time for dancing and making conquests
over the susceptible stationers’ hearts, who were
stationary under the gaze of the ladies’ eyes.
A married lady from Hunter’s Hill showed to
advantage in a brown brocaded silk toilette, hat to
match; her young lady friend being charming in
grey cashmere trimmed with satin. Padding-
ton sent a pretty maid in pompadour dress and
princess bonnet. A young lady—closely allied to
the chairman—seemed sweetly enchanting in a
costume of fawn cashmere and Henry II. hat.
Black broche dress was worn by a lady from
Erskine-street, while a Surry Hills belle seemed
perfection in bla°k velvet, and from Hunter-street
a lady was elegant in grey trimmed with massive
satin. Three visions of loveliness were the Miss
Wisehearts, in pure white. Handsome black
satin suited a l"dy from Camperdown. We can-
not tell all the winners of the prizes as we would
fet mixed; sufficient to say there were many
appy faces showing winners. Mr. A. C. Wise-
heart was the hon. sec., and he spared no trouble
to make all merry as a marriage bell.
♦ * ♦
About 200 sat down to the St. Patrick’s
Day banquet in the Masonic Hall on Monday night
—Mr. J. P, Garvan, M.L.A., in the chair. It was to
Mr. Copeland the most enthusiastic reception was
accorded. The chairman, in proposing “ The day
We celebrate,” made a capital speech
“ Come send round the wine, and leave points of
belief
To simpleton sages and reasoning fools,”
was the key-note, and it would not be easy to find
a more welcome or appropriate one. Messrs. G. R.
Dibbs, Copeland, J. G. O’Ryan, and Sir John
Robertson were among the speakers, and any
reference to the “ Orange ” and “ Green ” sym-
bols—so fraught with evil meaning to the “Ver-
dant Isle”—was studiously avoided. Sports, pic-
vjnes, and excursions in honour of him who estab-
lished the shamrock as a Rational symbol, and
evicted the snakes and toads from the country of
WS adoption, took place, not alone in Sydney and
its vicinity, but throughout the colony. At night,
the Gaiety Theatre was thronged to hear a concert
of Irish music, which was brought to a fitting
close by a spirited rendering of “ God Save Ire-
land,” into which the company threw their united
strength. Sic transit Patrick’s Day, 1884.

Miss Oracle de Lissa created a sensation
on board the Parramatta s.s. on her homeward
trip by her very clever step dancing. The Countess
of Rosebery expressed her approval, and w< s

Sydney, Wednesday.
Dear old BelLe,—I am extremely sorry tbat
you cannot see your way to get down in time for
the Liedertafel Concert; but never mind, better
luck next time, perhaps. I believe it is to be par-
ticularly good this time; and in order to make up
for the disappointment of those who, by reason of
the Protestant Hall being too small, cannot obtain
admission, it has been arranged that each concert
Is to be repeated—so the singers will be pretty hard
worked. Talk about the curiosity of woman 1 1
remember at the last concert many ladies, during
the interval, actually stood up, so as to have a
better view of each other. You see their curiosity
got the better of their manners. I promised my-
self that I would send you one of Freeman’s
pictures of the members of the Liedertafel, but
really my pocket-money has run so low this month
that I shall have to wait awhile. They are very
expensive these pictures, the smallest being 4s. 6d.
each; and these are really too small to distinguish
the faces well, so I should like to send you one of
the larger ones. Taking them altogether, they’re
not a bad-looking lot of men. I don’t think I ever
told you that Mr. M’Quade, the pianist, was back
in Sydney. We really missed him at the Lieder-
tafel Concerts, so it is to be hoped he will take
part in them again.
I had a nice letter from Miss Lydia Hastings this
week, Inviting me to attend her “ voice-builaing ”
class, which l believe she holds once a week. 1
certainly mean to go some time, for I am very
curious to know how she sets about it. By the
way, what a boon she would be to you with your
private theatricals! You used to gabble most
distressingly, most of you girls; I really think you
would have driven Miss Hastings frantic.
The Williamsons gave their farewell perform-
ance at the Royal on Friday, but the theatre was
not over well filled, I am sorry to say. I think
they were mistaken in not playing “btruckOil”
instead of “Rip Van Winkle” on tnelr last night,
for there is no doubt that, as Lizzie Stofel, Maggie
Moore has no rival, but as Qretchen she was just
the least bit disappointing. Rip—soft-hearted,
tipsy Rip—I liked very much; but perhaps 1
should not say so had I seen Jefferson act the part,
but, as I haven't, I declare I like Williamson best.
There were ever so many pretty girls in the circle,
and some beautiful di esses, too. A sweet-faceu
maiden wore cream satin and pink rosebuds ;
whilst her schoolfellow, with auburn hair cut short
to the classic head, was equally charming in pink
Indii muslin. A pale blue silk with very low
square-cut bodice adorned another fair beauty,
who wore a handsome gold necklet with pendants
set with torquoise. A lady in pink, who possessed
a glorious head of hair, had the same (pale gold)
dressed very high and adorned with tiny sprays of
maiden-hair ferns. The effect was simply charming.
A winsome little lady, in flowered muslin, trimmed
handsomely with black velvet, looked nice. A
pink nun’s veiling flounced skirt, with short
crimson velvet jacket and pearl ornaments, was
worn by a dark, plump lady. One of the hand-
somest opera cloaks I have seen this season was a
pale fawn-coloured ottoman cord, with brown
feather trimmings ; the owner was attired in a
pale lavender silk dress, with white lace sleeves
and trimmings. It often puzzles me to know why
some people go to theatres at all- For instance,
there was a pair sitting to our left who never
moved a muscle during the whole performance.
They neither laughed at the fun nor wept at the
pathos—Oh ! I could have shaken them both
Really, such people saouid stay at home : it puts
such a damper on one oven to look at their glum
faces. Very different was the Dr. who went to
see “Fedora” the other night, who, in the poison
scene, so far forgot that it was only acting tnat he
called out “ Why, in the name of goodness, don’t
you give her an emetic, you fools ?”
I am just wondering, Belle, dear, how in these
hard times we are going to keep pace with the
very expensive fashions for this coming season.
Finger-cosies (otherwise muffs) are to be adorned
with feather tips, not less than three, whilst boas
and seal-skin jackets will be in strong force.
Already winter goods are being shown in the shop
windows, and some of the hats I like “ quite well,”
as the Americans say when they wish to express
unqualified approval. A fawn silk beaver, some-
thing of the Henri Deux'shape, set round with
large crimson pompons, was stvlish, but the
newest and most becoming shape has abroad brim
which is caught up at either side and slightly
drooped in front and at the back. A very ugly
shape, which I do not think will gain much favour,
is exactly like a man’s tall hat minus a few inches
off the crown. They are decidedly loud, and have
no redeeming quality whatever. Such a pretty
dust cloak I saw yesterday. The material was the
the palest brown biege, but the tippet was com-
posed entirely of deep lace of the same
colour, and from shoulder to shoulder was
taken a deep crimson chenille cord, which was
fastened with bows of the same colour. I was
surprised to see several waistcoat bodies worn this
week on the Block. I had been under the impres-
sion they were things of the past. There can be no
doubt they are very stylish, and on a good figure
there is nothing more becoming. Imagine to your-
self a tall round blonde—how terribly flat most
blondes are I—with a dark green nun’s cloth dress,
very short cutaway jacket, with white pique waist-
coat extending nearly to the waist, buff gloves with
green velvet gauntlets, and the hat—well, that was
disappointing: of course I expected to see one of
those dear little straw jockey hats as an appropriate
finish to such a delicious costume, but nothing of
the sort—it was the very much overdone Henri
Deux, with the usual straps of narrow velvet
round the crown, and plumes in front. Some girls
have sufficient originality to strike out a fashion
for themselves, but It requires a good deal of
fortitude and daring to carry it out. I noticed
one to-day who had veered slightly out of the
usual groove. Her dress was a deep cream nun’s
veiling, made without either frill or flounce, save
a narrow kilting round the edge of the skirt. The
sole trimming was an enormous crimson silk
scarf which was taken round the slight waist and
loosely knotted in front, the deeply fringed ends
reaching nearly to the hem of the skirt. If the
effect was not quite satisfactory, it was, at least,
uncommon.
You will be sorry to hear that the first outing of
the Ashfleld Fishing Club was unfortunate. It
appears that one of the members managed to get
a hook through his finger, which necessitated
the'r returning to town in order to seek a Dr. It
was a great disappointment to them all, as they
had every chance of a good catch, and what was
worse than all, the sufferer had to undergo great
pain before the hook could be extricated. Yours
MAB.


H
ER SPEECH RESTORED.
Clair View, Inverell, December 10,1883.
Messrs. Publishers Bulletin.
Dear Sirs.—I beg to acquaint you of a marvellous
cure following on the use of St. Jacobs Oil, which
has taken place in my own family. I am a poor
man with eight children, and for years have been
a great sufferer from sciatica. My wife was ad-
vised to try St. Jacobs Oil. She procured a bottle,
and I have been using it of late with good re°ults;
but It ia of my eldest daughter, 13 years of age,
that I wish to tell you. She retired one night
about four months ago in her usual good health,
but the next morning she could not speak. M:
wife took her to Inverell to see Dr. , who said
her throat was ulcerated low down, aud he pre-
scribed cod liver oil and other medicines; and also
advised her to inhale the fumes of Stockholm tar,
saving she might never recover her speech again.
At the expiration of a fortnight, the medicine
having been finished, another visit to the Dr. was
made, who again prescribed for her, but told my
wife Ve had no hope of her ever being able to
sneak again. We began to despair, but the day l
the oil—about three months after she was
taken ill—I persuaded my wife, after we had
retired, to use the oil. She got up and
gave the girl two drops in water, and rubbed
It on her throat. Next morning we were
delighted to find that she could talk as well as ever,
and has been able to do so ever since.

A Great Business.— The United States o£
America is the home of some very large enter-
prises, but none perhaps greater than the business
conducted by Mr. G. G. Green, of Woodbury, New
Jersey, U.S.A. He is the proprietor of the well-
known Boschee’s German Syrup, which is un-
equalled as a remedy for Pulmonary and Bronchial
affections. He manufaeturers also Green’s August
Flower for Dyspepsia and all disorders of the
Liver. These preparations are used throughout
the civilized world, and thousands testify to their
valuable curative properties. Both these prepara-
tions have reached an immense sale solely on their
merits. Sample bottles of each are sold at 6d., or
full-sized bottles at 3s. Bd. All druggists keep

corruption in France, Hungary treed, the young

blot of slavery effaced from the United States,

THE SORROWS OF THE NOBIITY AND
GENTRY.
(Suggested by Archibald Forbes’ pathetic pictures
( of the reduced English Gentry.)
Pity the sorrows of a noble lord.
Who now to dine off gold can scarce afford ;
Who keeps ten horses where he kept a score,
And owns two mansions now, instead of four.
Pity the Marchioness, who has replaced
Her fam’ly diamonds with gems of paste ;
Pity her daughters, who in beauty s prime
Deign the same robes to wear a second time.
They have been known sometimes themselves to
Because 8 they keep two ladiesmaids the less ;
E’en the small Earl, who apes his father s follies,
Has but live pounds a week to spend on lollies.
Tax not the rich, that would be confiscation,
But tax plain folk, the body of the nation ;
They've nought to do with laws, but to obey them,
And nought to do with taxes, but to pay them.
Says Granny, with reference to Baker
Pasha’s recent defeat:—“ This disaster is simply
one more sad confirmation of the hopelessness of
ever converting the peacefully-inclined Egyptian
peasant into a soldier.” On the 18th of October
last, Lieutenant-General Sir Archibald Allison,
speaking of the doings of bis Highland Brigade
after it had advanced In one long wave upon the
Egyptian entrenchments at Tel-el-Kebir:— bo
earnest were the Egyptian gunners that they were
actually bayonetted after the redoubt had been
entered from the rear while still working their
pieces The advance of these battalions (Gordon
and Cameron Highlanders) was stoutly opposed
by the Egyptians of the Guard, who fell back sul-
lenly before them, and our men also suffered
heavily from a severe flank lire from an inner line
of wo’iks ...I must do justice to the Egyptian
troops. I never saw men fight more steadily.
Retiring up a line of works which wo had taken
in flank, they rallied at every re-entering angle,
at every battery, at every redoubt, and renewed
the light.” Can’t be converted into a soldier, eh!

After all, no one is so badly off in this

lu Egypt, Great Britain has not yet done
—not even yet commenced to set about doing—
wbat she went to Egypt to do. Not abuse has
been abolished, while more than one has been
carefully dug around and manured that it may
grow the more luxuriantly. Here, for instance, is
an illustration of the sort of reform backwards
which is now going on in the land of the fellah
under the aegis of the “moral forces” of England;
—Colonel Moncrietf, sent to Egypt to look after
the canals, has been appointed Under-Secretary of
Works, inasmuch as a Frenchman, who occupied
that post, had to bo dismissed to make room for
him, the French consul-general naturally enough
objected. n “ arrangement ” became necessary,
and »n "arrangement” was made eminently satis-
factory to everybodv except the Egyptian tax-
payer. The arrangement was this: the dismissed
S'renchman to be pensioned, and another x rench-
man to bo appointed to the sinecure post ot addi-
tional secretary—to balance Moncrieff's appoint-
meat! We forgot to mention, thourt, another
“ balancing” arrangement, and that is the dismissal
of 1600 subordinatj Egyptian in ordOT to
“promote economy,” and enable theControl to
perpetrate Jobs in the Interest of the friends of

our way. It was only last Tuesday that we caught
the barber’s Julius stealing our quinces. He was
caught red-handed with six in his possession. Next
morning we went over and had an elaborate shave
and titivating with thej“ club ’’ brush, which, con-
sidering we did not subscribe the stipulated Id. a
month, was an unprecedented honour. When it
was all over, and we smelt like a soap-shop with u
pork-butcher’s next door, we mentioned the cir-
cumstance of the quinces, and airily suggested
“that would make it right. But the barber
couldn’t see it. Therefore, in order to avoid a
personal combat, we “planked down, as he
termed it, 6d.; being 3d. for the ordinary manipu-
lation, and 3d. for the use of the “ club brush.

To return, however, to the Shilling
Plummer. We are very much afraid that John
has his weak point. His weak points, rather; for
when lubricated internally by muffles, he, like
Mr. Venus, becomes more pliable: what his other
weak point is we do not know. But mark 1 Bladen
does. D. W. B. Sladenl For why? Because
Bladen pervades the Plummer. Therefore Bladen
must know John s weak point. We wish we did.
What is it. now, Perennial Plummer—tracts or—
toffee ? We know, anyway, it must be something
Christian. There is no apology for the appearance
of Bladen in the Perlummhr. Au contralre. In
an article on the Zig-Zag, ho is Introduced to the
reader in a dfbonnair style. No saying— Well,
you see, dear reader, he came round to the office
and—the same woman washes for us both, so— —
or—“ Note —By some unaccountable error this
diabolical bosh has crept into our columns. We
darkly suspect our foreman, whose brother used
to drive Bladen's great aunt. Directly we can pay j
him the money we owe him, the man shall he lg- |
nominiously dismissed. Our readers oan rest as-
sured that they shall not, in future, be subjected
to a like annoyance.” Nothing like this, even:—
“ To our Readers.— We had business reasons for
printing a sonnet by Bladen, It will be found
under the heading of deaths.”
m * *
No! This, if you please, is the style of the
Pullummer:— “Professor Bladen, of the Sydney
University, describes his impressions of the Zig-
Zag in the following lines: —
“ ’Twas noon when we rode out of Lithgow town
To climb the mountains. Soon the path we tried
Was naked slippery rock, up which to ride
Was well-nigh hopeless without slipping down.
Those italics belong to this office. They are put
merely to point out the delicate imagery and
Eoetic wording of the quotation 1 On “ Bowenfels
e is equally eloquent, In a sonnet which breaks
out in another part of the Plummer, This much
of it will do:— , . .
“ . . Bowenfels begins
Half coaching town decaying for its sins (I),
Half suburb, where the folks whom duties call
To spend their days ’neath Lithgow’s smoky pall
May live to dear the coed duet from their skim
At eve.”
• • •
There! By the way, we wonder whether
the professor gives private lessons. We know a
mule—[Dinner!—Ed. B.]
The Hurlyburly of Burly Hurley.
A SOCIETY SCUFFLE.
. . . Mr. Hurley’s face was 'badly
scratched, and his beard liberally rended, while
Mr. Harris bore the marks of whip and fisticuffs.
A crowd had by this time assembled, and were un-
willing listeners to an outpouring by Mr. Harris
of the foulest and beastliest torrent of obscene
language that has ever disgraced the streets of
Maryborough even in her darkest days.”—Mary-
borough Chronicle. —
You must remember, Mr. Hurley ?—
You’ve not forgotten him, we hope I
The man who had a frightful down
Upon the poor old tott’ring Pope.
He damned the Papal chair in terms
So withering and stern,
That it’s a wonder John did not
“ Bust up the whole concern.”
He’s a Queensland member now, and, lo,
It seems that he did sneer.
And “put off ” passing gibes upon
A loca' auctioneer.
They meet. “ Ha, ha I—Did you say that ?”
“ I did 1” “You cur, you lie 1”
Then a whip came down on Hurley's head,
And a fist smote Harris’ eye.
They close. Bif, bang I oh, each with rage
Does surge and foam and seethe.
A cloud ot hair ; once more apart—
Bang I go the whips—they meet I
Then John “ gets on ” to Harris’ nose,
And then there is a cry
That Mr. Harris is a gougin’
Out John Hurley’s eye.
“ This is.”—we will a paper Quote—
“ A thing to be regretted,’ 1
For both were well-known public men,
Adored, ’tissald, and petted.
Loved by the fair, they sipped the sweets
Of nomage to satiety—
You’d think, perhaps this dread fracas
A sad bio w to society ?
Go to ! A little breeze like this
The thing gives quite a tone ;
They do not think it torrid, airs,
Up in that torrid zone ;
The reason ?—Well, just know, to this
Conclusion we have come—
’Tis that society, up North,
Is too mixed up with rum.
A FEW REMARKS ABOUT MUGS.
Tiiis isn’t a dissertation on crockery. Any
fond mother, intent upon gladdening “baby’s
heart with the presentation of a white china
drinking vessel bearing the inscription “For a
Good Little Boy,” in golden round-hand text, will
suffer the pangs of disappointment if she seeks,
in this article, for hints to guide her in her
momentous purchase. Neither are we treating ox
the “ mugs " of the low comedian—-those labori-
ously (studied facial contortions which provoke
shouts of merriment from the youthful, and
awaken in the old ’uns a thousand melancholy
memories of having witnessed the samoold busi-
ness. performed in the same old style, by many
another “mugger” for the last century or so.
No, men as “mugs are engaging pur attention
at the present moment. You all know what a
“mug” is, or, if you don t, you ought to. the
magsman's “mug,” now—the young man from
the country who tells his pathetic story bf
placed confidence in the police court—you all know
him. You discuss his guileless innocence with a
mingled scorn and pity that implies a confidmoe in
your own superior acumen, and remark w mix a
greeahornl” So he is—he is a “mug;
fully examine this particular species, independent
of his verdancy in the matter ot the match-box
trick,” and, maybe, you’ll find him no bigger tool
than you are. He d be far too wide-awake to be
hoodwinked by that little chit of a Bessie Brown,
for instance, and he d laugh at you, as Bessie s
“ mug.” Why, there’s your dashing young friend,
Tom: you couldn’t take him in with any match-
box trick, could you ? There arent many games
that they can givo Tom points at. But call m at
the restaurant Tom so constantly decorates wit s
his handsome presence, and ask Hebe who brings
her the flowers which Captain Cuff takes away in
his button-hole ? Tom’s an awful mug: “that

he'd be a pretty shy bird for a spieler to ' Pluck,
certainly—none of his money finds its way io
the pockets of the bookmakers, and he knows
a leetle too much to fall a victim to Hobe s bland
ishments. Rather I Jones bears the reputation ot
being about the keenest man in the trade, and so
he is. Such energy, too; he s down at the oflieo at
nine “sharp,” every morning, takes a nare
twenty minutes for luncheon, and rushes home
just in time to sit down to his 6.30 dinner- Cer-
tainly, he’s a good deal too tired to enjoy it, but
he enjoys the satisfaction of knowing that he s
had a “splendid day ”-and thats everything
None of Jones’ people stick 1to it like ke.does

THE DISTRUSTFUL WORSHIPPER.
When Gladstone, the dispatches say.
Goes privately to church to pray,
He stations a policeman there,
That none may interrupt the prayer
With dynamite, that new Invention
To catch a Minister’s attention.
If I were talking, face to face,
With God, in His own holy place.
Upon my bended knees, my back
Exposed to cowardly attack,
My trust in Him were much diminished
If He’d not guard me till I’d finished.
Think what a coldness would ensue
If, Gladstone, He should visit you,
And bring, to guard Him at your board,
An angel with a flaming sword I
To cold inaction in the lobby
You’d relegate that feathered Bobby.
Without reproach does God expect
To greet the guest and not protect ?—
Accept the tribute of his praise
And see him murdered asho prays ?
If this in Hlm’s accounted civil.
Then what's the matter with the Devil ?

(DANDELION),
THE GREAT LIVER REMEDY,
Australia’s favourite remedy. We all suffer more
or less from liver complaint, thereby hindering
other organs from fulfilling their functions. Set
the liver in order by taking the above remedy, and
heart, lungs, brain, and stomach will unite la
graceful chorus.
ABRAHAM’S PILLS,
The true invigorator. If your vital forces are
depressed, if you have a feeling of general lassi-
tude and weakness, or a presentiment of coming
disaster, your liver is unequal to Its work. To
obviate all these symntoms there is no remedy so
sure and certain as
ABRAHAM’S PILLS,
The great Health Restorer. A vast proportion of
the maladies and ailments attacking the human
frame are really due to a disordered liver. Set this
organ in order and health returns as if by magic.

Nervous Depression from Overwork.
Hugglsb Circulation and Growing Chil-
dren.
Sandusky, O., May 21,1880,
I have used your Acid Phosphate and can pro-
nounce it a very valuable addition. 1 find it use-
ful and beneficial in nervous dyspepsia, nervous
depression following overwork and anxiety, as well
as the gastric derangements. Where there is
venous stagnation and sluggish circulation, a dull,
heavy head, it is of undoubted value. Fast grow-
ing children require this valuable addition.

Boston, Mass., May 18,1880.
In regard to the Hereford's Acid Phosphate, I
have used it very extensively, and with the most
remarkable success.
I give it in dyspepsia and in all cases where there
la derangement or the liver and kidneys. With
m, patients It a*resd wonderfully
Nerve Tonic.
A. 8. Carpenter, M,D., Keene, N.H., says :
•* Hereford's Acid Phosphate is a valuable medi-
cine. I have taken it myself, and for several
years prescribed it for my patients, when suffering
from indigestion or innervation of the digestive
organs, ana always with satisfactory results. It is
a good nerve tonic, and in some cases of morbid
urine, ‘ it acts like a charm,’ producing the desired
result. It is pleasant to the taste, acceptable to the
stomach, and is, in my opinion, an excellent and
valuable compound.”
Can be borne by the most Sensitive
Stomachs.
Fair Haven, N.Y., March, 1880.
Hereford's Acid Phosphate, in elegance of com-
position, stands unrivalled. It Is pleasant to the
taste, and can be borne by the most sensitive
stomach. Have prescribed it with marked benefit
in indigestion and urinary troubles. It forms an
excellent substitute for ]Lemon juice, and as such
will furnish a refreshing 'drink for tne sick.

A FEW REASONS WHY THE CELEBRATED
Barron-Moxham American
Buggies and Carriages
Are the best imported into this country, and have
gained tkroughou the colonies such a high
reputation.
BECAUSE they are built of the best-selected and
thoroughly-seasoned stock
BECAUSE the wheels are all of the highest stand-
ard make
Because the iron-work consists of the very beat
steel and Norway iron, severely tested before
used
BECAUSE the trimmings are of the best No. 1
leather, and the upholstery Is unique
BECAUSE the beat of lead, oil, and varnishes are
used in their finish
BECAUSE they are each and all built under special
Instructions to, and personal supervision of,
one of the le ding carriage builders in America,
and specially constructed for the Australian
climate
And because all who use them say they arb thi
best.

Mis Aieutl
The Melbourne D.T. ha* been terribly
shocked and grieved by certain of Mr. Judge
Higinbotham’s doctrines. The reckless Justice, it
seems, recently asserted that “ there are circum-
stances la which an honourable man, to save hia
reputation, might deviate from the strict truth.”
Tho expression of sentiments such as these
aroused, as was only to bo expected, the indigna-
tion ef the Melbourne piety paper (that pride of
Presbyterians, in particular, and comfort of Chris-
tians, generally); but the D.T.’s Indignation to-
wards Mr. Hlgiabotham was as nothing compared
with the scorn it leels for a •‘morning contera-
fporary,” which has oeen—as tho D.T. sarcastically
puts it—“ Improving ’’ on his ideas. This ubao-
domg “morning contemporary” (the Age) has
sunk'to such a depth of degradation as to say, “it
may be laid down as a sate and unanswerable
1 generalisation that In civilised society, at any rate.
lying is not only excusable, but it is a necessity
which society could only dispense with at the cost
of its own comfort and existence. It is awful to
reflect upon the mischief which might have been
wrought throughout Victoria by these wicked
arguments of the Age, if the D.T. hadn’t rushed to
the rescue. The D,T. (as we’ve already remarked)
represents the Presbyterian interest, and conse-
quently has no practical acquaintance with lies,
but on the subject of liars and their inevitable
fate it is particularly well informed. In awe-
inspiring italics it tells us “ all liars shall have their
part in the lake which hurneth with fire and brim-
stone;” and as the article concludes with the re-
mark, “ our contemporary has vindicated finally,
and for ever, its right to the popular nick-name of
• Aiianias,’’ why ‘our contemporary” seems
booked for a warm place. So, as warmth is gene-
rally understood to keep up “the circulation,” it
is probable that the Age, i i the future life, will
have just as great an advantage over the f>.T. in
that important particular as what it baa in this
present, wicked world.
VARIOUS VERSES.
[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
His Love.
©n high their streams with shim’rlng sprays
'The splashing fountains throw,
And pinky sunsets’ lovely rays
O’er all cast sheeny glow;
There lovely Nature ever might
With unseen glories teem,
For all without love s halo bright
Were alien to their theme.
’Tia vain the flowers in glory grow,
la vain’s the sparrow’s song,
’Tis vain tho soft sweet breezes blow
The rustling leaves among;
The ocean rolls, the fountains spout,
Unheeded and unseen;
Unnoticed, too, fades slowly out
The sunset’s lovely sheen;
And still they linger ’neath the tree,
Where dark’nlng shadows fail,
And waning rays of sunset flee
Before night’s shrouding pall.
A quiet eve, a week gone by.
Nigh Hand wick’s sea-laved shore,
An amorous pair in ecstasy,
Did Love’s demesnes explore.
They sat beneath a spreading tree
Upon a rustic seat, .
Flowers around them gloriously
Were blooming, gay and sweet;
Tho spai rows twittered in tho tree.
And, 'mid the bran ohlets green,
Told their love tales with birdish glte
Behind their leafy screen.
From Coogee Bay the breezes light
Among the dark leaves sign,
And rustling ’mid the blossoms bright
There inland gently fiy:
There rolls before their heedless eyes
The vast and fickle deep, . .
Whose foam-fringed bosoms heave and nse
In mimic furies leap.
Oh. she was lovely, young, and fair,
And sweet as any rose , h „.
That in bright Nature s grandeur there
With richest fragrance grows.
Her lover worthy seemed to share
The raptures of a love,
With warm (caress by honour swear
A changeless heart to prove;
Around her little shapely waist
He passed his circling arm,
As though that pretty waist unlaced
He’d ever shield from harm.
The lovellght flashes in her eyes.
Deep blushes mount her cheek.
Her burning lips bewltchlngly
With love-lade kisses reek.
With throbbing heart, expectantly,
Bho wafl« Love’s message sweet,
And there that ardent youth to see
In sunpliance at her leet.
That lover, too, seemed now to ten
Borne fateful issue’s power,
As trem’lously his tones dispel
The silence of tho hour.
“ Ohl Annabel,” he murmur d low.
And with a faltTing tongue.
As tho’ some tales of awful woe
Were from his pale lips wrung;
As his portentous qii°st he speaks,
The crimson waves subside.
As if her soft and creamy cheeks
Had shamed the hectic tide.
Now downward droop her lovely eyes,
From his fond arm she slips.
And fast the ruby colour dies
Upon her dewy lips.
He lowly faltered. Annabel,
Oh I pain me not like that;
But tell me. Belle, if I look well

RHADAMANTHUS.
True Religion.
Living friendly, feeling friendly,
Acting fairly to all men.
Seeking to do that to others
They may do to me again.
Hating no man. scorning no man,
Wronging none by word or deed,
But forbearing, soothing, serving,
Thus 1 live, and this my creed.
Harsh condemning, fierce condemning,
jg of little Christian use ;
One soft word of kindly peace is
Worth a torrent of abuse.
Calling things bad, calling men bad,
Adds but darkness to their night;
If thou wouldst improve thy brother,
Let thy goodness be his light.
I have felt, and know how bitter.
Human coldness makes the world,
Every bosom round me frozen :
Not an eyo with pity pearled.
Still ray heart, with kindness teeming,
Glads when other hearts are glad,
And my eyes a tear-drop flndeth
At the sight of others sad.
Ah, bo kind : life hath no secret
For our happiness like this ;
Kindly hearts are seldom sad ones,
Blessings ever bring true bliss.
Lend a helping hand to others,
Smile th >ugh all the world should frown;
Man is man, we all are brothers,
Black, or red, or white, or brown.
Man is man, through all gradations—
Little reeks it where he stands,
How divided into nations.
Scattered over many lands.
Man is man by form and feature,
Man by vice and virtue too.
Man in all one common nature,
Speaks and binds us brothers true.
Ah, Where?
Around Samoas peak.
The stormy petrels shriek,
While surges roar;
And wildly-piping gules
Repeat in eerie waiis
What I deplore—
A dark-eyed maid,
In ocean laid.
Ay. round that fatal coast,
Still haunted Dy thy ghost,
Oh, Memory. I
Still doleful lyrics croon
Beneath the ghastly moon,
Still hopeless sigh,
Still long to fly—
Ah, where?
Beyond thy clutch, Despair 1
“Love that came with Rosen.”
O love, that came with roses
And tied at winter-tide,
Where now thr wing reposes
Thou wilt not long abide.
The autumn’s breath will chill thee
When laaves begin to full,
Some changeful longings nil thee,
And all thy vows recall,
O love, that laughed In sun-light
And sadden’d in the shade.
That shrunk in the wlerd wan-light,
The moon-mist shrouded made :
Where mirth is mad with laughter
Thy smiles thou’it lavish tree.
But tears that tlow thereafter
Shall win no sigh from thee.
O love, that came with roses
And died when they were blown,
My heart as calm reposes
As tho’ It had not known
The touch of cold caresses
That never passion moved,
Anl now no pang confesses
'l hat thou inconstant proved.

account for its extreme redness?” . , .
He * “ H’m 1 Well, the fact is, my dear, that question is at present puzzling wiser
heads than yours. 1 have just been reading a very learned opinion, to the effect that it
is caused by a large accumulation of moisture in the atmosphere held in a vasiculai
state in which the blue rays of the sun are absorbed, while the red and yellow rays
pass.’ For my own part, I hold that it is caused by the entire absence of moisture; in
short, is one natural consequence of the great drought.”

THE CAT AND THE MOUSE.
A FABLE.
“Before we proceed further with.this business,” observed the mouse, as she turned
under the oat’s naw, “ I would suggest that we give the matter greater consideration.
Your present px : oposals appear to me to be hurried; and I confess that I am somewhat
taken by surprise.” “ If you will only be concise,” returned the cat, fixing his claw on
the mouse’s back, and taking a thoughtful chew at his tail. “ Well, then,” began the
mouse “ I hav# long thought that in a world so vast as this, replete with every luxury
that heart can wish, and showing in all its adaptations of fruit, and flower, and crevice,
a providential provision for the wants of all, it is worthy consideration whether we,
the animal creation, have not been remiss in observing with regard for each others’
right# that inflexible probity which alone entitles ono to the respect of the community,
er even to life itself.” “How, then,” asked the cat, “do you account for those fibres of
hemp, and that flour-dustei beard?” “Ease that paw a bit, please,” groaned the
mouse, “and I will explain. There are depredations which are lawful, and ” As
the cat licked his Ups and walked away, he purred to the mouse inside, ‘ Go on with
your argument. I’m listening.”

AYER’S PILLS.
A largo proportion of tho diseases which
cause human suffering result from derange*
ment of the stomach, bowels, and liver.
Ayer’s Cathartic Pills act directly upon
these organs, and are especially designed to
cure the diseases caused by their derange-
ment, including Constipation, Indiges-
tion, Dyspepsia, Headache, Dysentery,
and a host of other ailments, for all of
which they are a safe, sure, prompt, and
pleasant remedy. The extensive use of these
Pills by eminent physicians in regular prac-
tice, shows unmistakably the estimation in
which they are held by the medical profes-
sion.
These Pills are compounded of vegetable
substances only, and are absolutely free from
calomel or any other injurious ingredient.
A Sufferer from Headache writes:
“AVer’s Pills are invaluable tome, and
are my constant companion. I have been
a severe sufferer from Headache, and your
Pills are the only thing I could look to
for relief. One dose will quickly move my
bowels and free my head from pain, 'they
are tho most effective and the easiest physic
- - • -■ •- - — *" me to
do so
ho.”
1882.
“I have used Ayer’s Pills lu number-
less instances as recommended by you, and
Lave never known them to fail to accomplish
the desired result. We constantly keep them
on hand at our home, and prize them as a
pleasant, safe, and reliable family medicine.
FOll DYSPEPSIA they are invaluable. f
T* Uayls*
Mexia, Texas, June 17, 1382.
The Rev, Francis B. Harlgwe, writing
from Atlanta, Oa., says: “For some years
past I have been subject to constipation,
from which, in spite of the use of medi-
cines of various kinds, I Buffered increasing
inconvenience, until some months ago 1
began taking Ayer’s Pills. They have
entirely corrected the costive habit, ana
have vastly improved my general health.
Ayer’s Cathartic Pills correct irregu-
larities of the bowels, stimulate the appe-
tite and digestion, and by their prompt and
thorough action give tone and vigor to tho
whole physical economy.

We hold no brief to defend Mrs. Besant
and Mr. Bradlaugh, and we do not say that the
“Fruits of Philosophy” is a work we should
—tacommevd for reading virginibus puerieque; but
we maintain that it is a work not immoral in Its
object, nor one whit more obscene (in the legal
sense), if so much so, as portions of scores of
standard classical works (the Bible included).
That it is “a filthy book” in the opinion of the
** highest legal and moral authorities of England,”
of the “ proper guardians of publ'c decency here,”
and of the prim and goody Echo, might go for
something with us were the book really filthy
and obscene (In the true and natural sense of those
words); but when we know that the word “ob-
scene” (as the word “blasphemous”) is often
applied by the highest and properest and purl-
tanicalest of our constituted authorities and self-
appointed censors with the view of persecuting
the advocates of theories antagonistic to vested
Interests and crystallise*.! dogmatisms, we prefer
to think for ourselves and to refrain from joining
with a crowd, thougn every unit of it bo a right
reverend or a right worshipful, to condemn those
whose guilt is not proven in clear and unimpeach-
able fashion. The truth is that thousands of
‘clear-minded, sound-hearted” men and women
still regard the prosecution for obscenity of the
authors of the work in question as having been a
vile and disgraceful persecution on the part of a
clique of bigots.
Thus a recent Victorian telegram:—“A
well-known legal manager on Sandhurst named
Fletcher has systematically swindled some dozen
companies which he managed. Yet his accounts
were regularly audited.” We simply take this
item as a text for a brief sermon. “Yet his ac-
counts were regularly audited.” Quite so: and we
dare say each of the companies he managed— to
victimise—had an iniluential directorate. Fact is,
directoral duties are more often shirked than per-
formed ; and, when performed, performed per-
functorily. There are men in Victoria, as in
N.8.W., who are on half a dozen boards—some of
them men with business of their own to attend to.
How can they possibly give the requisite attention
to every company on whose board they figure, and
from whose funds they draw emoluments ? “ One
great pull (says a London review) directorships
have over so many other means of livelihood now-
a-days is that they involve no examinations, either
physical or Intellectual. But we fancy that if
daily committees were attended by directors, and
if officials of companies were kept constantly on
the alert by the presence of one or more of the
board, who entered into all the details of its busi-
ness, fraud and peculations would be far more
rare and difficult than at present they are.” Our
notion is that the Legislature should do a little
bill, making directors a good deal more responsible
than they are now. More responsibility would in-
duce more attention.
The other day a worthy magistrate in the
old country sot it forth, as his opinion, that all
usurers ought to be “ pole-axed.” The man who,
in his official capacity, and when presiding over
the deliberations of a court occupied in the hear-
ing of a case in which a Shylock sought his pound
of flesh, could so wholesomely give tongue to such
a noble sentiment, should be immortalised. For
our part, we venerate this magistrate. He is of a
large grasp of intellect. He is capable of arriving
at a truth which his fellow Solons either shirk
or are incapable of realising. His graphic mode
of expressing his thought was admirable. Pole-
axed! Ha!—that is a good word; conveying to the
imagination a most delectable picture. Pole-axed!
That’s tho way they convert bullock into beef, and
so would this goodly officer make carrion of the
the usurer. Admirable idea! Noble conception!
Imagine the Levis, and Isaacs, and Benjamins,
and the rest of the great army of blood-suckers—
Imagine, we say, these leeches being yarded up
and “pithed,” as they pith cattle at the slaughter-
yards. Our soul tingles as the notion is realized
by our perception. And oh 1—fancy the shades of
the poor devils who have been done to death by
the harpies; fancy how they would gather around
in ecstacy, as the money-lenders were pole-axed.
Marcus Clarke would seat his impalpability, poor
fellow, on the rails, and kick up his ghostly heels
when Waxman’s turn came around. We are inti-
mately acquainted with some people who would
pay a premium for the privilege of acting as exe-
cutioner. Ahem I
Few matters are more pathetic in their
influence upon the observer than the sincere re-
pentance of the sinner, and his new-born zeal in
the cause of virtue and godliness. A remarkable
illustration of the effect of being born again has
of late been given to the Melbourne public by the
Melbourne Herald. For many years the
Herald has been regarded as a free and easy
journal, of a Bohemian type. But, of late, all this
has been changed. The object of the men who
now run the paper is to purify society, expose
abuses, and generally uplift its readers from the
mire of moral apathy and indifference. To tho
Herald tho Victorian public owes the smash up
of sweep swindlers; to the Herald, people who
live in the suburbs of Melbourne may gratefully
trace the circumstance that the ladies of pleasure
hunted out of the city are now residing among
them; to the Herald Nathan, the furniture man,
owes his prosecution. He says that it a'l came
about because he refused to pay an exorbitant
price for his advertisement; but who would
dream of attributing motives, other than pure a n d
honourable, to such men as Winter, Halfey, Martin,
and so on! Preposterous. Yet there are certain
ill-conditioned people who, while moved by tho
moral randan in which the Herald has lately en-
gaged, ask “ Wtat about the Clipper and the
Democrat ?” —papers which were enjoyed by the
patrons of tho brothel, and which pandered to the
grossest passions of human nature. The Clipper
and the Democrat were owned by a moral news-
paper proprietor, edited by a moral leader-
writer, and illustrated by a moral reporter.
They were about the hottest periodicals that
we have ever come across ; the more so that
their filth was daintily served up by the moral
leader-writer and his contributors. Of course, the
journals were suppressed, and the atmosphere so
far purified; and they who were engaged in their
publication, and profited by their extensive circu-
lation (for, alas! people will pay for their dirt),
repented of their sins. Still there are, as we have
said, ill-conditioned people who, while perusing
the highly moral articles in the Herald, ask
“What about the Clipper and tho Democrat ? ’
For ourselves, we see no more pertinence in such
a question than in the voluntary statement by the
old lady in Dickens’ novel: “ There are milestones
on the Dover road.” Ahem!
The London Jeweller.
London, September 1,1883.
“ The progress and success which it is possible
for a commercial enterprise to reach, is shown
very forcibly by a descriptive account which the
American Waltham Watch Company are now
Issuing to the English watch trade, and we under-
stand that any jewellers desirous of distributing
these leaflets in their neighbourhood with the
view of promoting business* can have a supply on
application to the offices of the Company at
Holboru-circus. The buildings at Waltham, it is
stated, cover an area of 48,374 feet, the frontage
on the street is 754 feet, length of main building
646 feet, aggregate length of benches 3'87 miles,
length of shafting 3'93 miles. These figures speak
eloquently of the present position of the enter-
prise, but the success and increasing sale of
the Waltham watch is very substantially proved
by the statement that it took 23 years to make
the first million watches, six years to make the
second million, and it is estimated that the third
million will be produced in about two years. It
would seem from this that every buyer of a
Waltham watch speaks well of it, and induces his
friends also to purchase, and they again do the
same, until the rate of increase becomes so for-
midable that it is difficult to comprehend what
will be the result a few years hence. But progress
like that shown in the leaflet referred to
proves not only the quality of the watch sold, but
also how well the Waltham Company must be
managed: for the best article will not force its
way in the world unless it is assisted by good
business capacity and generalship.
The Echo propounds the idea that the
Tngleside Powder Mills should not bo established
at Narrabeejn, “but upon some locality specially
set apart for factories of all sorts near enough to
the city and yet apart from any spot of peculiar
beauty,” etc. etc. Has not the Echo brains enough
to perceive that no more unsuitable site could pos-
sibly bo fixed upon for a powder factory than one
in a locality where other factories and their costly
machinery were numerous ?
In England, the average life exceeds that
of France by eleven years, in spite of the climatic
advantages which the “Froggies” enjoy. By the
way, the temperance gushers don’t mention this
little circumstance in their addresses. They ought
to—for, if the average Englishman (as they assert)
takes ten years off his life by his intemperance,
and yet contrives to hold out for eleven years
longer than the abstemious Frenchman, it would
gratify the national pride of their hearers to think
what a lot John Bull must have in hand to start
with.
The “Harmy” in Melbourne will require
to start a receiving-office for stolen property if
soldiers ” are going to keep on “ recruiting ” at
the present ratio. They’re not satisfied with re-
penting of past sins, but now they’re repenting of
past robberies (which is of more present import-
ance) and wish to return their ill-got gains. Major
Barker announces that the party who robbed a
man of a considerable sum of money near the
Princess’s Theatre has admittad his guilt, and
‘upon suitable evidence of ownership being fur-
nished to the Salvation Army solicitor the proceeds
of the robbery will be returned to the owner.”
Now, all these disclosures speak wonderfully well
for the Harmy from one point of view and remark-
ably badly from another. As regards this par-
ticular sum of money, by the bye, a good many
fellows have applied for it on the off chance of
furnishing “suitable evidence,” but cone of them
have guessed the exact amount, as yet.
One of the chief advantages of belonging
to the Harmy is that one never wants for society—
the true “soldier” is never alone. Such, at any
rate, is the testimony of Miss Minny Pabst, a
Hallelujah lass,’’ whose godly cognomen is
The Steam Holler.” Minnie is just now saving
souls down Sandhurst way, and last week she put
in an appearance (most of the “ lasses ” do, sooner
or later) at the Police Court, charg ing a youthful
Philistine with striking her a blow on the back of
the head, which “ might have killed her if she
hadn't had the ‘Hallelujah’ bonnet on.” It was
on being questioned as to whether any one was
standing near at the time of the assault, that the
Steam Roller ” made a statement which proves
conclusively the social advantage incidental to her
profession. She said “There was only me, the
Lord, and the young man.” So the Bench, evi-
dently considering that a young lady rejoicing in
such a body-guard could scarcely need the vulgar
protection of the law, dismissed the case.
The Ohinemetu Maoris are mad. There
was some mono y duo to the tribe from the Govern-
ment on account of land sold. They sent to Tau-
ranga as their commissioners to receive the
balance a European who had acted for them
previously as counsel, a half-caste who had con-
ducted the case for them in the Land Court, and a
native. The Government duly paid the balance,
£1050, to the authorised commissioners, but nary
a cent, reached Ohinemetu, for the simple reason
that the European appropriated £400 for services
rendered, the half-caste annexed £590 for ditto,
and the native cleared with the remaining £150.
This puts us in mind of the disposal of the moneys
forwarded to Constantinople some years ago as
England’s subscription to the Broussa Earthquake
Relief Fund. Of many hundreds of pounds col-
lected, only a score or so reached Broussa—only
just enough, in fact, to “ square ” the local pasha
and prevent his “ splitting ” on the other diverters
of the fund from its original destination.
The Water Police in Melbourne have a
fresh line of duty marked out for them. In addi-
tion to keeping refractory seamen under control,
nosing out contraband goods, and other details of
duty, they have now—according to the Melbourne
evening papers—to keep a sharp look-out for “ sea
monsters.” All on account of a shark that has
been disporting itself between Sandridge and
Williamstown, and which, the veracious scribes
tell us, “ lies on its back and displays a mouth big
enough to take in a small boat.” We fancy these
chroniclers of passing events must be following
the example of the “ monster of the deep ” in the
matter of lying. They leave us in ignorance as to
the size of the small boat, but that is purely a
matter of detail. But why should the Water
police be expected to look out for s°a monsters ?
The Cerberus has been refitted lately with new
boilers and things, and should be able to cope with
a shark. And then the reporters would have an
opportunity, perhaps, of describing the terrible
encounter between two sea monsters.
The Standard Barry is in agony over the
fact that Father Curran, of Dubbo, gave a state
school scholar a taste of his holy whip for waggishly
hailing him with “ Halloa ! old cumin’ pudding I >’
Out of this little pious tragedy the Barry organ
raises quite a heap of direful political ghosts, and
demands in the deepest Barry-tono, that the
priest be brought to his knees.” The holy man
who couldn’t swallow peaceably a little Curran’
jam, and the bigot who raises a howl over the
affair, are both pretty well worthy of the same cap
and bells.—
“ What I crack vile jokes upon my name I ” cries
Curran,
On all such impious brats I cry “ A murrain I ”
Just taste my lash, I'll teach ye not to sneer
On God’s anointed, while I hold sway here.”
Then Barry roars, “Oh, by King Billy’s beard,
Our Orange youth by no priest shall be ‘skeer’d ; ’
You just to Curran jelly will 1 squeeze,
And, d la David, bring you to your knees I ”
