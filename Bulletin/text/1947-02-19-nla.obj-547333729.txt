LYNMOUTH, DEVON.
A FTER. traversing the Oare Hill moorlands a thousand feet
above sea-level, the visitor to Lynmouth makes a descent from
Countisbury, enjoying spectacular views of hill and forest and sea
on the way. Other approaches to Lynmouth are by rail from
Barnstaple or by sea from Ilfracombe. This romantic old village
marks the junction of two brawling streams, the East and West'
Lyns, which unite in the centre of the village and flow together
to the sea.
The valley of the West Lyn is lined with trees, while on either
side the rocks rise in fantastic shapes and the river leaps and seethes
on its unsmo’oth journey to the sea. At Lynmouth, instead of a
sandy beach, there is an expanse of rough black boulders which
provide good scrambling as compensation for lack of bathing.
Closely overlooking Lynmouth, on a ledge some four hundred feet
up, is its twin village of Lynton, the two places being connected
by a cliff railway.
“Often I think of that beautiful town
That is seated by the sea,
Often in thought go up and down
The pleasant streets of that dear old town.”
—Longfellow.

"CONTINENTAL REVUE."
Winifred Bambrick’s Continental Revue
(Faber) is a remarkable novel about a
revue company on tour in Europe just
before the outbreak of the war. It seems
to have been written in the highest spirits
and at top speed ; as Byron said he wrote
Don Juan, “never blotting a line.”
There are 300 people in the revue
company—midgets, giants, acrobats,
tumblers, snake-charmers, chorus-girls,
adagio dancers, knife-throwers, a Yogi
contortionist, troupes of Chinese and
Arabs, singers, clowns, “all abnormal
people, all people with skill.” There are
leopards, dogs, ponies, pythons, elephants,
a performing mule. The great cities of
England and the Continent are described,
decorating the background with their
varied architecture, peopling it with their
colorful and clashing nationalities:
London, Rotterdam, Berlin, Leipzig,
Antwerp. And India, Persia, Arabia, the
Far East and America are brought into
the picture when the careers of the per-
formers are discussed. The Director even
hopes to take his mammoth show to
Australia.
It seems such a profusion of material
that no writer could hope to shape and
compress it into a story, separate indi-
viduals from the crowd and develop them
as characters in a drama.
And at first it looks as if this is the
case. After a few introductory scenes to
show the immensity of the company
and the turmoil in which it rehearses,
eats, drinks, loves, squabbles and travels,
the author devotes 12 full chapters to a
description of the preparation and per-
formance of one great opening night in
London.
It is superbly done. You feel that you
are at the show, and that it is the greatest
show that ever was seen, the Tivoli multi-
plied by a million, something Roman
about it:
The tiny ponies dashed away, whirling
in figures of eight across and around the
stage. There-were four sets of ponies each
five abreast, driven by a girl on roller-
skates. Eyes sparkling, nostrils quivering,
they danced and pranced to the familiar
music, around and around, rows of bells
jingling, white harness studded with jewels
sparkling in the light. Then, just as quickly
as they had come, they were clattering
through the wings and the Russian dancers
were on stage. Around and around they
whirled catching the frenzy of the act.
They broke away and Olga, the wife of
Kasha, flung herself into the Kamarisky
dance.
Lubichov, enthused by the music of his
native land, beat his baton with more and
more zest. Again the Russian dancers flung
.themselves into action. They leapt and
jumped and whirled, their white satin suits,
snow-white fur hats, scarlet leather boots,
vivid in the light.
The curtain dropped and parted again.
Kasha was alone in a spotlight, clad in
scarlet cossack uniform with black fur hat
and black tiding boots. This was his
dagger dance. Daggers sparkled in his
high boots, daggers glittered in his sleeves,
and four daggers were held by their points
in between his teeth. He whirled and
turned, spinning across the stage, throwing
his daggers high into the air and on to
the stage, leaping back and forth as the
audience broke into cheers. He was Kasha,
the greatest dagger xlancer of all Europe,
making his first London appearance.
Suddenly the lights went out. They were
on again immediately and the curtain was
rising off the Typhoon scene
“Where is Kahn with the elephants?”
cried Pappy Newman.
Magnificently done, an extraordinary
feat of writing to make a novel as vivid
as the stage itself and to organise, in the
mind and on paper, so swift, so stupen-
dous and so spectacular an entertainment
—but the book could not keep on like
this. Even with its glimpses of backstage
life, a living presentation of a stage per-
formance is not a novel, not a story. The
art of the novel consists in the dramati-
sation of individuals; the mass is back-
ground.
But, then, astonishingly quickly—of
course the process is begun in the first
chapter—the author begins to detach in-
dividuals from the crowd; all the time
performing the equally difficult feat of
keeping the mass in the reader’s mind,
keeping one aware that these people—
the Director and,his assistant, the midget
lady who loves to mother everybody,
Kathi the ethereal ballet-dancer, Mario’
who loves “all people and things, par-
ticularly young and beautiful girls and
old and beautiful things,” Anna who
acts with the leopards, and Tania who
poses in the nude and is consumed Wy
ambition to become a “star” —that all
these people (and dozens more are in-
dividualised, including some of the
animals) are living in the midst of fellow-
performers numbering hundreds, audi-
ences of thousands and nations of mil-
lions.
Plots and sub-plots become manifest
find grip the attention; Tania’s incessant
manoeuvres for power • and place; the
rivalry between the Director and the artist
Peter Kyrle for the love of Kathi; Anna’s
jealousy—for she is the star of the show
and the Director’s mistress —of both
Tania and Kathi; Mario’s picaresque
love affairs ; an Italian girl’s love for an
Englishman; Tania’s attempt to steal
Kyrle from Kathi, her fear of a scound-
relly uncle who blackmails her. And
while- these and other individual dramas
are working step by step towards crisis—
towards Tania’s trapping of Kyrle into
complicity in the murder of her uncle and
Anna’s letting loose of a leopard to maul
Tania (events that do not seem unduly
melodramatic in the excited world of this
novel) —the whole mass of the company
is increasingly involved in the political
complexities of Europe, the shadow of
coming war.
The book finishes with war breaking
out, the company scattered, some dead,
some lost, all torn from their old paths.
But it is not —like a French novel of
comparable gusto, Chevalier’s Cloche-
merle —a despairing, a finally tragic book.
“One show is ’ended,” the author con-
cludes, “but another is always beginning.”
Her book, like most of Conrad’s novels,
is both actual and symbolical; for it is
quite plainly stated that it represents life
against war, laughter against war, love
against war, art against war. Life is seen
as a great tragicomedy, a carnival, and
though the Germans brought a dreadful
doom upon Europe, a new carnival is
always beginning.
It is impossible to say whether or not
Winifred Bambrick will become an im-
portant novelist. One book —admittedly
autobiographical as far as the back-
ground, though not the people, is con-
cerned —is not enough. But that one
book is certainly a notable piece of work.
It has faults, serious ones ; the end is too
abrupt, Kathi and Peter Kyrle are un-
real ; but, taking the novel as a whole,
it delights, it moves, it amuses, it
astonishes, it “works.”
The book has a restless vitality, an
impetuosity and a kind of careless pro-
fundity that bring to mind the writing
of only one other contemporary writer at
present being published ‘in England,
Christina Stead. Christina Stead, erf
course, is an Australian; Winifred Bam-
brick a Canadian. There is a stream of
new life waiting in the Dominions to re-
fresh the English culture; if —as they so
rarely do—the English publishers will
admit it.
Cave and Tree Top.
\
All right-minded" small boys like to
get as far above and as far below the
earth’s surface as they can —by climbing
trees and exploring caves. Wordsworth
might have said they are trying to return
to heaven ; the evolutionists that they are
going through the monkey stage again ;
and Ivan T. Sanderson, author of Carib-
bean Treasure (Viking Press, New York),
who goes down into caves to be bitten
by bats and rats and walks on treetops
amongst venomous snakes and spiders,
thinks he does it in the interests of
science.
And certainly science does benefit. Mr.
Sanderson is a naturalist of repute and he
discovers, among other rarities, a lumin-
ous lizard. Even the tourist trade and
the cattle industry are benefited, for he
assures people intending to visit Trinidad
that they are not likely to be slain* by
the celebrated blood - sucking bat an
engaging little creature with the face of a
devil and the habits of a Communist—
and at the same time he investigates the
danger to stock from the “vampire” ; for
if is a carrier of rabies and in 1906
caused the death of 4000 cattle and horses
in Brazil and in 1931 slew in this way
60 per cent, of all the cattle in the Matto
Grosso.
Still it is not the benefit to science
that makes his book fascinating, but the
adventure of it. For nobody has out-
grown the thrill of —at least vicariously—
swinging down a liana into a ravine,
collecting a bat from a cliff-face on the
way down, and tumbling into a pit at
the bottom inhabited by a mad pig and
a maddened snake.
Mr. Sanderson is a singularly active
naturalist. He does not potter, he does
not dawdle; but whenever he comes to
a tree he climbs it, whenever he comes
to a cave he explores it, whenever he
comes to ; a cliff or an underground
waterfall he falls over it. Whenever it
becomes dark he gets lost; whenever he
catches a bat it bites him ; and whenever
he sees anything atrociously ugly and
poisonous he rushes at it and nets it or
bottles it. Underground, he lives in this
sort of world:
Standing in that thick silence I had the
feeling that I was on the lips of some
loathsome monster, perhaps the dark earth
itself.... The net bag was long. I swept it
through the air, gave it a twist, and brought
it to earth„ Then each bat was captured
as he crawled out through' the end. About
the fifth that came out rounded on me and
fastened his teeth in my finger. That bite
was real agony I.looked down to select
a remnant of handkerchief with which to
tie the bag, and was confronted with prob-
ably as ghoulish a sight as even Nature could
devise. Around me crouched a motionless
circle of dark objects that appeared in the
half-light to be about the size of footballs.
... .This circle of silent, squatting, men-
acing things was composed of immense
crabs. I flashed on the torch and the whole
circle of them dropped their tall periscope
eyes and waved their huge pincers in front
of them.
Naturally, Mr. Sanderson goes bound-
ing about in the darkness trying to catch
one of the crabs. Then he discovers his
luminous lizard. Then he goes on into
darkness “so total that it became almost
hypnotic, and one got a disturbing sen-
sation of not really existing at all except
in one’s mind” ; and there he has his
trousers chewed by a giant rat, puts his
hand on a centipede, bottles the creature
(of course), and proceeds further and
further underground into the nether-
most pit where the giant crabs roll to
die and where there are bones and char-
coal, suggesting that some solitary man
had lived and died there.
Above ground, Mr. Sanderson hurtles
up a palm-tree and prowls (by night)
around the “miniature Kew Gardens” of
its top:
Every time I touched one of the fronds
a host of wood lice came out at tremendous
speed and quickly disappeared amongst the
surrounding foliage I came upon the
body of one of the animals [shot at from
the ground] wedged between two creepers'.
It proved to be a pale reddish-orange-
colored rat with a pure white be11y....1
had to clear away a lot of creepers and
parasitic plants, and as I moved the last
of these 1 spotted something larger than
a root hanging from it. The torchlight
showed this to be a very interesting small
snake with a tiny round head, perfectly
immense eyes, and an elegantly cross-
barred body.. . .There was a varied life
upon this swaying island universe, quite
unlike anything we had encountered on the
ground. Further search brought to light
a number of the most beautiful snails with
slenderly tapering shells, translucent and
pure white except for a lemon-yellow tip.
Still further search unearths, or un-
trees, some incandescent beetles and a
monstrous spider. Mr. Sanderson, un-
daunted, climbs the palm again the next
day and is bitten by a scorpion. Then
he goes to Haiti for a quiet holiday and
is gassed and stung by another variety
of scorpion that squirts acid at its
enemies and at naturalists. This beast
he bottles.
The whole of Caribbean Treasure is a
bottle of such treasure. The Red Page’s
copy came direct from America. If the
book is not generally available here —
for we see far too few American books —
some Australian publisher should reprint
it. It is too good to miss.
Introduction to Brennan.
One thing is certain about Christopher
Brennan ; nobody who met him could
forget him. Professor A. R. Chisholm
describes him in Christopher Brennan:
The Man and His Poetry (Angus and
Robertson):
The pity of it was, of course, that
Brennan’s mind wasn’t on his trousers —
that he didn’t get more of the humor and
rich humanity of his personality into his
poetry. There are stars in the cosmic
spaces ; but there is also a lot of empti-
ness.
Professor Chisholm is one of the co-
editors (the other is J. J. Quinn) who are
preparing Brennan’s collected work,
prose and poetry, for its long-overdue
publication. The present little volume,
consisting of two lectures delivered at Can-
berra, is possibly intended to arouse in-
terest in the larger work. It should cer-
tainly do that, and, giving first-hand pic-
tures of the poet and a well-balanced
analysis of his poetry, it is well worth
reading for its own sake.
The sonorous voice, the leonine head with
its great mane of black hair brushed back
right over the crown, the hugeness of the
man, his big eagle nose We were left
a cold meal, with some excellent potato
salad. To this Brennan added a couple of
.large onions and of course plenty Of bur-
gundy. Then he brewed black coffee,
giving me a normal cup but serving himself
in an enormous vessel about the size of a
flowerpot. He also swallowed a huge glass
of brandy; and to complete this Gargan-
tuan setting he filled his immense pipe
I was so fascinated and exalted that as he
escorted me to the tram towards dusk I
hardly dared to let myself notice that he
was wearing an ancient pair of slippers and
the seat was hanging out of his trousers.
Those were details of which he was prob-
ably unaware, and which would not have
worried him in any case. His mind was
on the cosmic spaces.
Various Verse
Silver Mine.
“Come, let us strip the moonlight from
the sea.
Store and save it
Against the day when aspiring men shall
be
Fit to have it.
Let us not beat it into foil
Lest men too soon
Should find, ravish and spoil
This lustre of the moon ;
No, let us hide it deep beneath the soil,
In earth’s bosom save and store.
Render it smooth and sleek as oil
And secretly and slyly pour
The molten magic into crevice and vein
Of obdurate rock, where they must toil,
Delving and sweating, in Mexico, in
Spain,
Patiently mining,
Hugging the ore, resolving and refining,
Contriving cunningly but slowly
Before they win the metal pure ana
holy . . .
Ah, look! the fools have found it,
Stamped and crowned it,
And to the wheel of lustful commerce
bound it . . J’

ARNOLD WALL.
The Cycads.
These smooth dark flames flicker at
time’s own root.
Round them the rising forests of the
years
alter the climates of forgotten earth
and silt with leaves the climate of first
birth.
Only the antique cycads sullenly
keep the old bargain life has long since
broken ;
and cursed by age, through each chill
century
they watch the shrunken moon, but never
die,
for time forgets the promise he once
made,
and change forgets that they are left
alone.
Among the complicated birds and flowers
they seem a generation carved in stone.
Leaning together, down those gulfs they
stare
over, whose darkness dance the brilliant
/ birds
that cry in air one moment and are gone;
and with their countless suns the years
spin on.
Take their cold seed and set it in the
mind,
and its slow root will lengthen deep and
deep,
till, following, you cling on the last ledge
over the unthinkable, unfathomed edge
beyond which man remembers only sleep.

Old Tom Dances.
The grass is bleached like a barmaid’s
hair.
As soft as her arms is the evening air,
And old Tom dances in the failing light,
A foot in day and a foot in nightt
Old Tom dances; he skips like a hare;
And the rising moon had better beware
For Tom and his pockets are stuffed with
rum
And he dares the moon and ’em all to
come.
“Wooh there, bullocks!” he tells his feet;
“There’s rum in the billy, there’s rum
, for meat.
Up there, Baldy ! Up there. Roan !”
And he talks to his feet in a bullocky’s
tone.
Who is that peeping through sunset eyes
As the sun sinks and the stars rise ?
He thought that boy forty years dead
For he pulled the blankets over his head.
The boy looks out, his kelpie fears
Forgotten, forgotten the twisted years.
Tom lies with his lover in moonlit grass
And the boy is spared the dam’s still
glass.

Who was Machiavelli?
Niccolo Machiavelli, Italian statesman and
political philosopher, was bora at Florence in
1469. Secretary to the Council of Liberty and
Peace, Florence (1498-1512), he carried out several
diplomatic missions in the Italian States, France
and Germany. Deprived of office by the Medici
when they regained power in Florence (1512),
he was imprisoned for a time. He retired to
his estate near San Casciano in Val di Pesq,
and devoted himself to* study and writing.
His most famous work, II Principe (“The
Prince”), contains his theory of government
and a number of maxims of practical state-
craft. He wrote many other works.

Some information about the deterioration of
oil paintings?
One of the worst enemies of oil paintings
is water, water vapor or moisture in the air.
Canvas is commonly sized with glue before
an oil ground is applied, and the picture con-
sequently is separated from the cloth by an
exceedingly thin layer of glue; if this is
moistened from the back the picture may
immediately detach itself from the canvas, while
if water seeps through cracks and fissures on
the face of a painting the same effect is pro-
duced. It is inadvisable to use water or mix-
tures containing water for cleaning most old
pictures, and when the experienced restorer finds
it necessary to do so he will use it as sparingly
as possible and dry the picture thoroughly
immediately afterward. Blisters and semi-
detached pieces pf paint may be glued down
and pressed if glue can be inserted under
them. Such operations call for some practice
and skill. A hypodermic springe is often
useful for inserting the glue behind blisters
and other raised areas, and in some cases it
is necessary to make a small hole by punctur-
ing the film with a needle before inserting the
hollow needle. It is sometimes recommended
that these spots should be first softened with
solvents, but this procedure is not always use-
ful, and the impregnation of a loosened surface
by flooding it with gum, resin varnishes or
oil is likewise of doubtful value except in some
complex cases.

Method of glazing home-made pottery?
Mix 46.4 parts white lead, 2 parts quick-
lime, 10.3 parts china clay, and 19.2 parts
silica thoroughly and add sufficient water to
make the mixture the consistency of cream.
Put through a fine sieve several times and apply
to the pottery either by dipping, spraying or
with a brush. After thoroughly drying, fire
in a kiln up to about 10Q deg. C. More facts
obtainable from The Art and Craft of the
Potter, by G. M. Forsyth.
* * * *
Method of preparing lime mortar?
The proportions are two or three parts of
sand to one part lime. Since in practice the
measuring is done only roughly, sand is added
if the mixture appears too rich, while the
actual gauging depends upon the nature of
the sand. Very fine sand is a disadvantage, as
it makes a compact lime mortar that prevents
the air from penetrating. This results in the
mortar on the inside of the wall being reduced
eventually to a dry powder with no cementing
value. In the mixing process a heap of rock
lime is placed in the centre of a ring of sand
and water is sprayed on to the lime until it
is saturated. The lime at qnce begins to
hydrate and in doing so generates much heat.
As the slaking takes place the sand and lime
are mixed together. The heap, when thoroughly
mixed, is covered with sapd, protected and left
to “season” so as to complete the slaking of
. any hard lumps of lime. The “seasoning” may
take from a few hours to several days, the
time depending on the quality and variety of
lime „ used. Before the mixture is used water
is added.
Brief Answers.
E.M.: (1) Yes, but for added precaution it
would be wise to get a school inspector’s cer-
tificate under the N.S.W. Public Instruction
Act. (2) Depends on value of rest of estate,
to whom property is left and other factors.
(3) Depends on amount of rent she receives.
(4) Yes E.V.Q.: They were treated either
as “enemy aliens” or “refugee aliens” and were
required to register and be subject to aliens’
restrictions but were not, merely on account
of nationality, interned. Internment depended
to a great extent on their political views
J.E.: A police officer has no power to arrest
and confine a person whongt he suspects of
having committed an offence, merely for the
purpose of questioning him. His duty is to
take an arrested person withdbt unreasonable
delay and by the most reasonably direct route
before a magistrate to be dealt with according
to law A.C.S.: Assuming the sum to have
been set aside from income, it would be tax-
able in the year in which it was earned....
W.A.: The dirigible balloon Graf Zeppelin
left Friedrichshafen, Germany, on October 11,
1928, at 2 a.m. and arrived at Lakehurst, New
Jersey, U.S.A., on Ofct. 15, 1928, at 5.38 p.m.,
having flown 6630 miles in four days 15 hours

What do umpires talk about
As they walk to the wicket?
Is it jive, or horticulture,
Or the history of cricket?
The artisan deep in constructive thought
About the object that his skill has wrought
Is roused to progress by the Union Rules
And learns the subtler craft of downing tools.
To leave the home unroofed, men without food,
Is simple service for the common good.
Concerted inactivity we must admit
Is the most modern way of gaining it.
He came, he raced, he conquered,
That mighty Queensland hprse.
His wins have just about occurred
On every well-known course.
He passed across the world of sport
Like a comet in the sky,
He very seldom has been caught,
Of the judge he was not shy.
Now, broken down, he must retire,
For stud duty he was saved,
To become, we hope, a greater sire
.When we farewell have waved.
America he’s heading for.
Our loss is their great gain.
Farewell, great horse, for ever more,
May your sons win world-wide fame.
BALLADE.
Give me your Hand, O unknown brotherhood,
Scattered through ardent lands and singing seas,
Put down the pen or pencil, ink or blood;
Stretch your cramped fingers out and give them ease.
They also serve who only stand and wait,
They also sweat who strive and fail to win;
One bond cements our fellowship, our fate
To be rejected by The Bulletin.
Why should we envy those too happy men
To whom all gates fly open at a touch?
How should they prize the cunning of their pen
Plying so freely where we fall so much?
They are too near the enforced anchorite,
No means of sinning and so freed from sin.
To whom men clamor for each thing they write,
Not once rejected by The Bulletin.
Yet, if promotion fall on one of us,
One by self-study or by chill advice
Weaned from his native joyous clumsiness
To walk the sword-edge perilously nice.
We shall hold out to him a speeding hand,
Though unto us he be no longer kin,
And bravely see walk out of no-man’s-land
The bloke accepted by The Bulletin.
Envoi.
Prince, thou art brave and brilliant, tried and true;
Few are the realms yet left for thee to win.
Where all are common, hast thou conquered, too?
Art thou accepted by The Bulletin?


LIGHT in the DARKNESS
By STANDBY
AS far as my limited vision allows me
to see there is nothing attractive
about the furnishings of my room.
Four near-white walls, a door and
window, a plain dressing-table and a
solitary, uncomfortable - looking chair.
The bed on which I’m lying about com-
pletes the picture.
I don’t know about the view from the
window and I can’t say I’m particularly
interested in it. It’s bright sunlight out-
side and sunlight hurts —like the very
devil.
Ih an hour, or perhaps two hours if the
doctor has had a busy day, they’ll take
me to a room at the end of the passage
and remove one of my eyes.
I can’t pretend that I’m dreading it or
that I shall be sorry to lose the eye. In
its day it has served me well, but recently
I have come to regard it as one does a
fiercely-aching tooth—something I shall
be pleased to be rid of. No one but a
fool would cling to a decayed tooth that
has ached and throbbed incessantly for
months.
A voice, perhaps my inner self, says:
“You’re like the little boy who whistles
to show he isn’t afraid of the dark.”
AMI? I don’t think so. It can never
be really dark for me even if the
worst happens. And the eye surgeon who
is doing the job has warned me that it
can happen. He’s a canny Scot, sparing
of words, but with a kindly understanding
twinkle in his brown eyes. Certainly not
one of those cheerfully optimistic fools
who believe in showing the patient only
the bright side.
“It’s a drastic decision to make,” he
said, placing his fingertips together and
regarding me solemnly. “A verra drastic
one —to remove a man’s eye. Particularly
in your case. You understand that if” ——
here he went into technical details quite
beyond my comprehension—“there is a
possibility that you may lose the sight of
the other one. You understand that?”
I nodded, “Yes. Dr, Murchison ex-
plained that to me.”
“Aye. We’ve talked it over carefully,
he and I, and we’re agreed that, under the
circumstances, it’s the only thing to do.”
“To take a chance,” I said.
“To remove the eye,” he corrected.
Well, we are all three agreed about that
and the only feeling I have is relief that
soon I shall be free from pain. They’ve
guaranteed me that. They have also
warned me what a terrible thing it is to
lose this precious thing called sight.
I understand that, of course. I am no
longer young and I am no unimaginative
fool. That, if the worst comes, will be
my biggest consolation. Strange that I
should have always cursed my too vivid
imagination. It has been a handicap,
often making a coward of me, but now it
• will be my biggest blessing.
The eye is a lens that projects a series
of pictures on the screen of the brain —
motion pictures in technicolor. Some
brains don’t seem to record the pictures
clearly; they let them flicker across and
vanish for all time or, if they do record
them, they record only the essential, out-
standing facts, completely losing the finei
details and underlying beauty. Mine
thank God, has recorded every detail
minutely and carefully, storing it awaj
for all time to be produced and re-
screened at will.
And I suppose, in one way and an-
other, I have seen more than most mer
see in a lifetime.
'T' HE endless column of horsemer
* strung out across the Sinai Desertth«
Anzac Mounted Division riding out tc
the attack ; myself, a lad of eighteen, om
of them, thrilled and excited at the pros-
pect of the coming battle, yet frightened,
frightenfed that soon I may be maimed
for life, but even more afraid that some-
one will discover the shameful secret oi
my fear.
The pictures of that campaign are as
fresh and clear as if they had happened
yesterday. The vast expanse of mono-
tonous desert, sandhill after sandhill
sparsely covered with stunted camel bush
stretching in interminable rows to a shim-
mering horizon. Strings of heavily-laden
camels gazing with haughty disdain at the
antics of our frightened horses. How we
hated that job of camel escort —we, as
much as our horses.
Fierce desert encounters where we lie
flat in the hot sand behind stunted bushes,
firing steadily into similar bushes on the
opposite hilltop. Zipping bullets kick up
little spurts of sand all around us. More
whine-and snarl their way overhead, while
behind us the white puffs of shrapnel are
bursting over the hollow where our horses
are sheltering . . .
One desert scene of exceptional beauty.
Riding in from outpost duty in the first
light of dawn one of those rare desert
fogs has settled down on us, blotting out
everything beyond the range of a few
yards.
Our horses blunder into the base of a
steep sandhill and stop. That gives me
an idea. The fog may only be low-lying
I may be able to climb above it and pick
out some landmark or at least recognise
the east. I hand my horse over and start
to c|imb. The steeply-sloping sand comes
almost to my knees, sliding away from
under me at every step, but at last I
reach the top. My head and then my
whole body emerges above the fog and
I stand gasping in admiration.
The sun is just rising, a huge sun of
fiery red, set in a field of red and gold.
It lavishes the glory of its color on the
surface of this sea off fog, stretching as
far as my eyes can see, a soft ocean of
gold and delicate pinks. Here and there
through its surface the tops of the highest
sandhills protrude, tiny islands.
I am alone in fairyland.
A movement on my right causes me to
swing round and the illusion is broken.
A horseman has shot into view—a long,
lean rider whose battered old felt hat is
pulled down over one eye, a large bunch
of emu feathers droops down over the
broad brim. The rider sits his horse —a
wiry little Queensland stockhorse —with
the careless ease of the true bushman, one
hand lightly holding
the reins and the
other resting on his
horse’s rump as he
lounges half-turned
in his saddle. His
rifle rests across the
pommel. Because the
top of his sandhill
does not rise above
it the horse’s fet-
locks are lost in the fog, creating the im-
pression that horse and rider are sus-
pended in space.
For a few seconds the man sits there,
apparently as spellbound with the beauty
of the scene as I am, and in a flash I
realise that he has not spoiled my picture.
He has completed it. Like a masterpiece
in sculpture they stand there, a horse and
rider rising from the mists. A symbol!
These two, pieces of Australia, will con-
quer the vast desert and the lands beyond
it.
The horseman turns his head and I
recognise Charles Cordon of B Squadron.
He extends a long brown arm and calls:
“Bloody pretty, ain’t it?”
“Too bloody right,” T call back,
anxious to show that I am of the same
casual breed as he. I slide back down
my sandhill then and send my mates up to
have a look while I hold the horses . . .
Another picture. Our first view of
Palestine. Green fields set in orderly
pattern, red poppies bursting into bloom.
Truly this is the Promised Land towards
which we have fought, sweated and toiled
for so many weary months . ..
Another outpost scene, not beautiful
but stark and terrifying, lit only by the
light of the rising moon. The place, we
are told, is called El Burg. Beyond us
lies Jerusalem. The night is filled with
noises—the crashes of exploding shells,
the steady clattering of machine-guns, the
ragged crackling of rifle fire and, under-
lying everything, the hysterical overture
of “Allah, Allah, Allah” as Jacko works
himself up for his attack. Vague figures
in the moonlight, hundreds of them mov-
ing relentlessly forward while we, a lonely
outpost of twelve 'men, fight our way
desperately back to the main line.
A cloud tears jtself from the moon’s
face and reveals the barren rocky hillside
crowded with men, but our little party
has dwindled to four. The Hotchkiss
gunner grunts and falls slowly forward
on top of his gun. I drag him aside,
seize the gun and commence firing. The
tongue of flame from the stammering
gun lights the three of us vividly. A
bullet crashes with sledge-hammer force
into my jaw . . .
FROM war to peace and pictures of
life on a Queensland cattle station.
Wild scrub cattle racing for the scrub
and riders recklessly spurring their horses,
heedless of trees, fallen logs and melon-
holes, filled only with the glorious excite-
ment of the chase, and anxious only to
swing those leaders before the mob can
split up in the tangle of the dense vine
scrub ahead . . .
The first bul-
lock I ever threw.
Have you ever
thrown a wild
scr u b bullock
streaking madly
for the nearest
scrub? You gal-
lop up behind
him, grasp his
outstretched tail,
spur your horse forward past his flanks,
and heave. If you’ve timed it rightly
down he comes, nose first into the dirt,
and then somersaults over with an
almighty crash.
You, with the help of a good horse,
have done it and you get a hell of a
thrill at the knowledge and at the sight
of the great brute lying there. You don’t
stop to admire him, of course, or to
gloat over his downfall. If you do he’ll
be on his feet, charging at you with
murder in his eyes in a very short time.
You bound off, hurl yourself across his
heaving flanks and bind his hindlegsl
tightly together with your “bull strap.”
Then you take time off to roll yourself
a smoke and gloat, using your victim’s
rump for a seat.
Tired, bellowing -cattle stringing into
the yards in the moonlight; the dust of
countless yardings rises up to where the
moon glitters on the leaves of the big
box-trees around the yard. It fills your
nostrils with its sharp bitter smell and
clogs your already parched mouth till
you cough and spit.
The last few cows and calves straggle
in, tired men slide off tired horses and
move forward to put the sliprails up just
as that inevitable, cantankerous old cow
breaks out. A flash of horns, a snort and
she’s gone. She’ll be out of sight in the
darkness and thick saplings before the
first man can mount. But Blue is there;
good old Blue, just as tired as the tiredest
of us but still willing.
“Git ’old of ’er, Blue, Good dawg,
Blue. Tear ’er bloody ’ide orf.”
A scamper of padded feet and Blue is
gone. We step inside, clearing the mob
away from the rails and stand motionless
against the big ironbark posts, waiting.
A drumming of hooves, a high-pitched
bellowing of the old cow expressing pain
and rage, and she crashes past us into
the yard. A small form hurtles after and
strong teeth snap savagely as Blue gets
in his final bite —the one for luck.
“That’ll do. Blue. Let ’er go. Good
dawg, Blue. Bloody good dawg.”
The sound of a hand patting Blue’s
heaving ribs, the dog’s heavy panting
changing to a cough and a sneeze as he
frees his lungs from the bitter dust, an
we put the rails up. Blue has vanished
to cool himself off and slake his thirst in
the dam beyond the hut. In a few
minutes we’ll be following his ex-
ample ...
AND the sea! Stored away I have
pictures of it in all its moods, pictures
so vivid that I have no need to see it to
be able to describe it accurately. Just
let me hear it and smell it and feel the
force of the wind on my face and I’ll tell
you its color and everything about it. . .
The white beach of some sheltered bay
in the lee of an island. Palm trees leaning
tiredly out towards the deep blue waters
of the anchorage.
The faintest of swells rocks the
schooner lying there with a motion so
slight that you have to look at her gently-
swaying inasts to be sure that she is
rocking. It moves on a long, lazy,
scarcely-perceptible line, almost loses it-
self in the pale emerald green waters of
the shallows, and breaks on the white
beach. Not with a sullen roar, but with a
musical tinkle of shells and broken coral
clinking together and a soft swishing
sigh of satisfaction as of a long journey
finished at last.
The smell of that sea is indescribable.
I only know that it’s sweet and clean.
And the sea, the same sea, in an angry
mood during the cyclone, season when
great, grey-green rollers rear themselves
up in ragged lines, their crests a smother
of dirty foam,, and hurl themselves with
dull angry thuds on the beach.
No clean sweet smell about it now, but
a strong stale tang of dead sfeaweed and
all manner of strange things—sailormen’s
bones perhaps—stirred up from the sea-
bed.
Of ships. A ship’s fo’c’sle head strug-
gling upwards through a welter of foam,
water cascading down on to the well-
deck to add its weight to the mighty
volume already trying to tdar our flimsy
hatch-covers aside.
And myself at the wheel, scared stiff
that the next grey-bearded monster will
crash down on her before she has time
to recover, sending us down and down;
completely [forgetting my job till the
mate’s voice, unafraid and unemotional,
says, “Watch your steering, there. Don’t
let her head swing off like that.”
Myself, years later as officer of the
watch in a different ship but with the
same angry, turbulent sea, repeating those
very words in—l hoped—a calm, un-
emotional voice to a scared helmsman.
“Watch your steering, there. Don’t let
her head swing off like that.”
Calm moonlit nights in the tropics
when looking down from the bridge I
could see a fragile fantastic world of
phosphorescence curling outwards from
the bows, tumbling, swirling aft.
Dark islands, resting on their own
shadows, slipping silently by.
Another moonlit night, in war this
time. Bombs screaming down on a
crowded anchorage. Earsplitting ex-
plosions along the beach alongside us and
in the water all around us. Trucks and
buildings along the waterfront blazing
furiously, lighting up the scene with an
orange light, revealing every detail of
the target for the next bomber.
Down comes the next lot and I hurl
myself fiat on the deck against the armor-
plated wheelhouse. A ship astern of
us is burning, adding her light to the
hellish scene.
She must have been loaded with petrol
judging from the height of the flames.
Well, we are filled to the match-covers
with petrol, 100-octane aviation fuel, and
ammunition.
MY own launch, cruising among the
islands of the Great Barrier Reef.
Blue, sunny days, lying at anchor,
reef fishing. Hauling up fish of every
size and color.
Giant, repulsive-looking groper that
fought stubbornly for a few minutes, and

then came up like so much deadweight
till they floated, yellow distended belly
up, waiting to be gaffed.
The beautiful red emperor that fought
every inch of the way up till you heaved
him aboard, a flapping, gasping beauty of
red, pink and glittering gold. The smell
of freshly-caught fish sizzling in the pan
wafting up from the galley.
Homeward bound with a leading
breeze, all sails set and drawing, and the
old girl heeling over as she reels off the
knots. The best and fastest launch on
the coast . . .
Of one trip
home in par-
ticu 1 a r. The
glass IS going
down and down.
Ragged, dirty-
looking patches
of cloud break
from the heavy
mass forming in
the sou’-east and
go racing by so low overhead that it
seems as if they must tear themselves
open on our wildly swaying mainmast.
Undoubtedly there’s a cyclone about
and not too ..far off by the way the glass
is behaving, but I must keep on. The
nearest real shelter is my own moorings
in the Creek. The old girl will be safe
there. If we get there. In my mind there
is a real doubt about that, for the sea is
truly enormous. Great snarling waves
crash over our bows with dull heavy
thuds that remind us that the sea is some-
thing solid, incompressible and uncon-
trollable.
But under staysail, reefed mainsail and
mizzen the old girl rises to the worst of
them with the grace of a soaring albatross.
Most of the time she is heeling over till
the sea boils over her lee rail. I have the
engine going full out and we’re fairly
roaring along. That’s what I want.
Speed! Speed! We must get in before
the worst of it hits us. Staunch as she
is the old girl would never stand up to
the full force of a cyclone.
I have ordered my passengers below
and closed everything down. They don’t
like it, but I daren’t risk having anyone
on deck. Even the heavy plateglass
windows of the wheelhouse are closed
down, but above the clatter of the engine
and the crash of breaking seas outside I
can hear an unfamiliar noise. It is like
the beat of muffled drums or the noise
of steady rain on an iron roof.
I hand the wheel over to my deckhand
and cautiously slide back the little hatch
above my head. The downdraft of wind
from the mainsail hits me like a blow.
I close the hatch, satisfied. The noise
is the drumming of the wind on our
taut, wet sails. My God, it is blowing. '
NEARLY halfway across, two more
hours to go, and the rain hits us.
Hits us? It smashes into us with a force
that threatens to crash its way through
the heavy plateglass. It is not falling.
Like the spray flung from our stream-
ing bows it is driven horizontally by the
howling wind.
In two seconds it has blotted out every
landmark. But it hasn’t caught me
napping ; I’ve been expecting it. I have
a bearing on a point of land ahead, and
for the last hour I’ve been carefully
checking our leeway. I can’t afford to
make a mistake.
To get into my creek I must pass
within half a mile of an extensive reef
which lies just two miles offshore, a
murderous reef of jagged rock and coral.
It will be awash at this stage of the tide
and I must pass to the weather side of it.
Most of my passengers are seasick. All
of them are afraid. Well, so am I afraid,
but I must not let them suspect it.
They’re depending on me. They’ve paid
their passage money and they’re looking
to me to put them ashore safely.
Four of the more venturesome spirits
have crowded into the wheelhouse with
me and are watfching me, anxiously
searching my face for any sign of the
nervousness they themselves are feeling.
But I have the advantage of them. I
know they’re doing it. I can feel their
eyes trying to uncover my feelings. Very
casually I light a cigarette and remark:
“Another hour and fifty minutes and
we’ll be in the creek. If this breeze holds
we’ll make a record crossing.”
The tension relaxes and other cigarettes
are lit. The fog from our breaths clouds
the glass in front of us like a white wall.
Someone produces a towel and rubs it
off. I laugh. The cleared glass reveals
the dim shape of our straining staysail.
Further than that no eyes can see. The
only glass I want kept clear at present is'
the face of the binnacle.
Four-thirty. Almost the deadline and
still no sign of land.
For the last half-hour I have been
keeping her as close into the wind as I
dare. I must clear that reef. I open up
the wheelhouse windows and let the rain
and spray drive in in a solid deluge.
My deckhand has gone to the main-
sheet and a passenger to the mizzen with
instructions to hang on with hands and
feet and be ready to free off. When we
sight land we’ll be uncomfortably close
to it.
And then the miracle! A sudden
clearing of the rain as if a hand has
flung a curtain aside. There ahead of
us is the bold, rocky headland marking
the entrance of the creek. Away astern
of us, well out on our starb’d quarter, the
lifting squall great breakers dash-
ing themselves to pieces on the sunken
reef.
We are coming in on the course I
always come in on! I hope my voice
sounds normal as I bellow “Slack away
on those sheets.”
In the creek, the quiet sheltered little
creek that placidly disclaims all connec-
tion with the turbulent raging monster
outside.
Hands are everywhere shaking mine.
Someone is holding out a glass of rum
strong enough to drop an elepnant.
“Nice work, Skipper. A wonderful
piece of work. A miracle of seaman-
ship.”
Yes. A miracle, but not of my making.
The gods of the elements were in a
freakish mood that day. I imagine they
said “Let’s scare hell out of this bloke.
Let’s show him how little he really knows
about the sea and what puhy things he
and his grand launch are.”
And then at the last moment one took
pity and called “Belay, there. He’s had
enough. He’s beaten and he knows it.
Give him a break.”
Yes, the Voice says, you’ve knocked
around a bit, but you can’t live alto-
gether in the past, you know. Not for
the years you still have left to live. Can’t
you realise what it will mean never to
see anything again? ~ Not even your
wonderful sea?,
OF course I can. And no matter what
happens I will see it. Haven’t I had
practice at it already, sometimes when
the pain from the bright sunlight has
forced me to keep both my eyes tightly
closed behind dark glasses? Didn’t I
fool old Mac over that very nicely?
Mac is the pilot
and, incidentally, my
best friend. When
he brings a ship up
the river past my
house he walks to the
wing of the bridge
and waves. That’s a
greeting and an inti-
mation that, when he
berths, he’ll be along to see if I’ve got a
bottle on the ice.
Last week he brought a ship in and
caught me at a particularly bad moment.
I heard the hoarse bellow of the ship’s
siren as she rounded the bend—Mac’s
signal to me —but for the life of me I
couldn’t look out over the river. I only
wanted to stay inside and keep both eyes
closed.

JAPS A PROBLEM STILL.
A striking picture of Japan —beaten
back from the vast empire it briefly held ;
hemmed into its home islands; for the
time being broken as a war menace; its
8.000. or more formerly formidable
troops gone back to their homes; its
people being»proselytised into the fold
of democracy; but fundamentally un-
changed, and so adding up to a consider-
able problem still —is given in a London
“Fortnightly” article by John Morris.
The writer lived in Japan for four years
before the war, left on exchange eight
months after Pearl Harbor, and recently
returned on a six-months visit.
The extent of the destruction in Japan
astonished Morris. His “outstanding im-
pression” was “the deterioration and
damage that have taken place.” He
makes this surprising comparison: “To
understand the present state of Japan it
is useless to think in terms of destruc-
tion as we came to know it in Europe.
In London even after the worst raids
something always remained ; it may have
been only the cellar or outer walls of a
house, but at least it was recognisable.
In Japan it is quite different.”
Instancing Tokyo (“with the one ex-
ception of Kyoto, which was never
bombed, the same applies to every major
town in Japan”), the writer describes the
city’s central core of modern steel and
concrete buildings as merely battered,
with a building here and there gutted, but
“Outside this area the picture changes
completely. The rest of Tokyo (the
Japanese claimed that it was the third-
biggest city in the world) has practically
disappeared; it was burnt to ashes in
three big raids [in 1945]. The destruc-
tion in Tokyo is on almost a Carthaginian
scale.”
How great a scale, these figures indi-
cate: “Before the war the population of
Tokyo was somewhere around 7,000,000.
It has now been reduced to about
3.000. That is, more than the total
combined populations of Sydney and
Melbourne aren’t there any more! And
the seats have been ripped out of what
trams there are to pack the passengers,
all standing, in to the limit.
The writer reports small houses now
occupied by up to a dozen persons ; “and
while the Japanese do not attach the
same importance as we do to privacy, the
present conditions of living are not cal-
culated to bring about those social and
mental changes which are so necessary if
the Japanese are ever to take their place
in a peaceful and democratic world.”
No Sense of Guilt
Against that background of destruc-
tion and living conditions the writer pro-
ceeds to look into the two main tasks in
the Jap problem: “destroying Japan’s
capacity, both actual and potential, again
to be a menace,” and the second, long-
term objective of “the destruction of
Japan’s will to disturb the peace of the
world.” As to the first:
Japan’s capacity to be a military menace
has already been largely destroyed; the
acres of ruined factories are in themselves
almost sufficient evidence. Japan- has now
neither an army nor a navy, and the bulk
of her merchant shipping had been sunk
even before the end of the war. There
would seem to be, however, a comparison
here with the state of Germany after the
first world war; in point of fact the situa-
tion is not comparable. Germany, a
country with thousands of miles of land
frontiers, had internal resources of those
raw materials without which the heavy in-
. dustry essential to war-making cannot be
carried on. Once the occupation was ended
it became impossible to prevent the Ger-
man nation from rearming. Moreover, in
the first world war the destruction (even
the dislocation) of Germany’s industrial
resources vyas, by present standards, infini-
tesimal; although the Allies were victorious,
Germany’s capacity again to make war
never was destroyed.
Japan, on the other hand, has now been
reduced to the four main islands generally
known as Japan proper. Since she now
has neither any armed forces nor a mer-
chant navy, it is easy for the Allies, with
their strategic bases all over the Pacific,
to control what goes in and out of the
country. It should also be noted that
Japan’s heavy industries were entirely de-
pendent upon imports. Her internal sup-
plies of iron, which in any case were small,
were useless for the production of high-
grade steel, and Japanese coal is useful
only for domestic purposes. It can, then,
be assumed that the first aim of the occu-
pation—the destruction of Japan’s military
capacity—is, if not completed, well on the
way towards attainment. It follows that
Japan is in no position to acquire the
materials or build the installations necessary
for atomic research.
The writer is much less satisfied re-
garding the other main task, “the de-
struction of Japan’s will to disturb the
peace of the world” at some indefinite
future date. Having talked with many
hundreds of Japanese iq his recent six-
months visit, he has to report;
I never once sensed the slightest feeling
of guilt; the attitude of most people was
exactly the same as it was before the war.
Indeed, there were times when I found
-Chicago “Tribune.”
ANXIOUS TO GET AT THE NEST.
myself wondering whether the war had
actually taken place, for in certain sections
of society (particularly among the higher
ranks of civil servants) any mention of it
appeared to be regarded as an error of
taste. Most Japanese have, however, a
sense of failure and frustration, and with
this is coupled a consciousness that their
leaders were guilty of what one might
describe as iniquitous ineptitude, rather
than inept iniquity. Everybody talks in
terms of the new-found democracy, but I
never came across a single Japanese who
could give a satisfactory definition of the
term. There is at present a nation-wide
willingness, indeed desire, to act in a demo-
cratic manner. At the same time it is very
obvious that most of the people are only
acting; I found few signs of a fundamental
change in thought.
A curious sidelight on this was pro-
vided when, as reported by Chicago
“Tribune,” a U.S. Congress Naval Sub-
committee chairman, Representative Izac,
at a press meeting in Tokyo “inquired
of the Japanese reporters if they were
happier now that they were free of the
old regimentation” and “a notable silence
ensued.”
A Wholesale Purge
The opinion that there has been no
change of Jap feeling has the support of
the significant fact that the Japanese Gov-
ernment (of course because MacArthur
ordered it) is ousting from office
no fewer than 175,000 local officials—
mayors, headmen of villages and the like.
N.Y. “Herald Tribune” comment on this
purge would also appear to be strong
support for the view that there has been
no real change of feeling:
These local officials have been the leaders
in efforts to evade or ignore Allied orders
for reform. They have endeavored to main-
tain the same school system, with the same
instruction, that existed before the war.
They have tried to continue the stringent
political control of the Japanese that has
prevented all growth of democracy. They
are still the chief supporters of State Shinto,
the abominable religion used by militarists
to convince the Japanese that aggression
was sanctioned by their gods. They have
' done everything possible to make the
American occupation a mere interlude in
which a defeated Japan can revive and
can plan to restore every evil institution
the Allies have sought to destroy.
With so many leaders still so engaged
progress in giving the Japanese mass “de-
mocracy” must have been slight. “There
is not much evidence to be found outside
Tokyo,” the “Herald Tribune” con-
cluded, “that the remaking of Japan is
really under way,” and the “Atlantic
Monthly” has stated: “Apart from the
disappearance of the armed forces, the
shedding of imperial divinity and the re-
vival of free elections nothing funda-
mental has gone,”
One report puts the number expected
to be affected by the purge at the whole-
sale figure of 1,500,000. The purge has
been set down for completion by April
15, after which elections of replacements
will be held. Various observers who have
been in Japan have noted that the number
of really competent
Japs for filling any
form of administrative
jobs appears to be de-
cidedly limited; there is
also the question
whether those to be
elected will prove in
office any different from
their predecessors.
An extraordinary fea-
ture of the purge—
commented on by Lon-
don “Times” Tokyo
correspondent as par-
ticularly “disturbing
Japanese public
opinion” is that
whereby “all relatives
up to the third degree
of consanguinity are de-
barred for a period of
10 years from any post
held by the purged per-
son at the time of his
dismissal.” The “Times”
man mentions “consis-
tently exerted pressure
by the extreme Left”
as having brought about this drastic
stipulation, which he finds is welcomed
alike by the “ultra-nationalists,”, who
“realise that the family feelings of the
Japanese people will be outraged and
that they would have all the best brains
of Japan on their side if they attempt a
return to power,” and by the Com-
munists, who “see a golden opportunity
for acquiring coveted positions in politics,
industry and organs of public opinion.”
In an American view, Russia has tried
to extend its Asian spread to Japan by
helping Jap Communists to interfere with
General MacArthur’s control. The ex-
tent to which inciting defiance of that
control has, in succeeded has been
shown in General MacArthur’s having to
clamp down hard on moves for a general
strike, which also makes its own com-
ment on the Japs’ failure to accept the
role of a defeated people still under mili-
tary occupation.
On this threat to the MacArthur con-
trol the London “Times” correspondent
in another report stated that labor in
Japan, “whipped by Communists,” was
rapidly getting out of control. He added:
It is certain that lawlessness is increasing
and that the whole attitude of the Japanese
people, whatever their political complexion,
is beginning to stiffen; their resilience is
returning, and they no longer carry out the
orders of Allied headquarters with the abso-
lute obedience that marked the early stages
of the occupation.
Re-education Doubts
The problem boils down to whether
“remaking” a nation is more than a wish-
ful dream; whether it is possible to re-
educate an entire people, particularly
such a people as the Japs, and in the
time that the occupation is likely to last.
As to this the writer of the “Fortnightly”
article refers to “the pathological home-
sickness of the Americans,” and, while
urging that the task is more likely to be
successfully accomplished if there is
greater British representation in the work,
he has to add:
I am not suggesting, however, that the
British, as a whole, have any burning de-
sire to be represented in the occupation.
The fact is quite otherwise, since the
ordinary citizen of Britain is hardly aware
of what is happening in the Far East.
In the same writer’s view, the task will
take at least two complete generations.
And what a task! “General MacArthur,
in his directives to the Japanese Govern-
ment, has constantly stressed the neces-
sity for the introduction of democratic
methods into every branch of public and
private life. The difficulty, as the
Supreme Commander has himself pointed
out, lies in the very nature of democracy
itself. It must arise gradually out of the
heartfelt desire of the people themselves;
any attempt to introduce democracy by
purely arbitrary means is bound to end
in failure,” In any case, the writer is
“extremely doubtful whether anything
can be done to change the mentality of
the adult population of Japan.” For the
re-education of the others the teaching
of such subjects as “history, geography
and ethics has been forbidden until new
textbooks, purged of all nationalistic
bias, have been prepared.” As a further
idea of the size of the job:
It is also proposed to make an exhaus-
tive inquiry into the credentials of every
Japanese teacher in order to decide whether
he or she, as the case may be, is a fit per-
son to remain in the profession. This
would seem a very right and proper course
of action, but since it is proposed (also
very rightly) that every teacher shall be
personally interviewed, and there are some
414,000 school and university teachers in
Japan, it is obviously going to take a very
long time before even the ground can be
cleared for the planting of new seeds.
Meanwhile, neither teachers nor students
are very regular in their attendance. In
any case, these proposals deal only with
half the question; no one has yet sug-
gested how, when the undesirable teachers
(and it is certain there are a great many)
have been weeded out, new ones are to be
obtained.
Whether or not belief in such an
attempt to re-educate a nation is fal-
lacious: remains to be proved. All that is
definite is that General MacArthur is
“carrying out a task of almost super-
human difficulty with great skill,” and
any rise again of Japan to its recent war
strength has at least been postponed.
MORE SPY LORE.
Chairman Lilienthal, of the civilian
control commission appointed by Presi-
dent Truman to watch over the atom-
bomb secrets and developments, was in
a dry-humor mood when he was lately
questioned on his job by U.S. Senators.
Stating that his commission intended to
keep atomic energy primarily as a mili-
tary weapon “because the present state of
international affairs demands it,” and
that he saw great danger in any relaxing
of security measures “while the world is
enjoying what is sometimes referred to
as peace,” he added that “events like
the uncovering of the spy ring in Canada”
did not make his job one that “induced
slumber at night.”
The operations of the Soviet spy ring
(or rings) continue to be a live topic
for commentators overseas, especially
American, The “Saturday Evening Post”
introduced two recent long articles on the
subject by Sidney Shallett with: “Here
is the whole sordid story of the Soviet
espionage network in Canada and its

Shalleff flVes another significant extract
from the very plainspoken report of the
Canadian Royal Commissioners:
There can be no doubt in our minds that
these attempts, very often successful, to
obtain here secret and confidential infor-
mation cannot be qualified as casual or
isolated. They are not merely the acts of
qverzealous Soviet employees anxious to
inform their own Government. The set-up
of this organisation in Canada is the result
of a long preparation by trained and ex-
perienced men, who have come here for the
express purpose of carrying on spying
activities, and who have employed all the
resources at their disposal, with or without
corruption, to fulfill the tasks assigned to
them.
Shallett states that there existed in
Canada “at least two major spy rings”'—
a military-intelligence network headed by
Colonsl Zabotin and a secret-police ring
headed by Vitali G. Pavlov, second secre-
tary to the Soviet Embassy. They worked
quite separately; Zabotin Only got wind
of the rival show by accident; “in other
words, the Russians didn’t let their right
spy know what their left spy was doing.”
And “the same thing was true of the
United States”; Shallett insists that it
would apply even more so in the U.S.:
Canada is a country of 12,000,000 whose
war secrets were infinitesimal compared
with those of the U.S. The Russian dip-
lomatic corps and other representatives
there numbered about 190. The United
States is a country of more than 130,000,000,
centre of the atomic-bomb development
and other of the war’s greatest secrets, and
the,Russians have more than 1000 diplo-
matic and representatives in the U.S.
Shallett also declares that the Russian
spying in Canada dated back many years,
though the military espionage began in
earnest only in 1942, when Major
Sokolov arrived in Ottawa and “began to
reform the previous organisation.” “As
a footnote on the art of How to Bite the
Hand that Feeds you,” writes Shallett,
“Sokolov originally came over as an in-
spector in connection with the Canadian
mutual-aid programme to Russia.” In
the Canadian view that was the ugliest
feature of the whole ugly business/
THE TURKISH GATEWAY.
Diggers who fought against the Turks
in what has been called the First Last
War would have their doubts about the
finding of a “Saturday Evening Post”
writer that “the Russian armies could
overwhelm the Turkish armies in a few
months.”
Even if the Turks were left to stand
alone in such a clash—which most cer-
tainly would not happen—-predictions of
the kind, looking perfectly safe on paper
values, have a way of being always proved
wrong in action. Practically all wars
have been a great deal longer than was
expected.
Prophecy regarding the Turks has even
put their defeat at a few days instead
of months. It reckons .without their
fighting quality; Lawrence of Arabia
called them “the greatest natural fighters
in the world.” They are spending more
than half their Budget on defence ; keep-
ing at fighting strength, on “World Re-
port” figures, an army of up to 800,000
which could quickly be expanded to
1,000,000. Even though not equipped on
the most up-to-date lines, an army of a
million Turks, fighting in and for their
own country, would be no pushover for
anybody.
Apart from that, the Turks have the
confidence of strong support in their re-
fusal to become another Soviet satellite
nation. They have their alliance with
Britain, and, something new in their ex-
perience, the very plainly stated support
of the U.S., whose Navy Secretary For-
restal a few months back issued a formal
statement to the effect that units of the
U.S. Navy were in the Mediterranean
and would remain there “to support
Allied occupafion policy in Europe and
to protect United States’ interests and
support United States’ policies in the
area.” The “Saturday Evening Post”
writer Demaree Bess, in a recent report
from Ankara headed “Up to Our Necks
in Turkey,” gave as reasons for the U.S.
involvement;
Those who formulate U.S. policies in
Washington have decided that it is essential,
for U.S. security and for the sake of world
peace, to coniine Russia within . certain
limits. U.S. policymakers believe that if
Russia gets control of these Turkish straits
—the Dardanelles and the Bosporus—
Russian expansionists might then be
tempted to sweep on through all the lands
of the Middle East.
If this should happen the whole post-
war structure, so slowly and painfully being
pieced together, might be brought down
in ruins.
Accordingly, it is American policy now
to take a firm stand against Russian ex-
pansion wherever we have sound reasons
and the power to do so. And it is Tur-
key’s misfortune that geography has made
this country one of these places, one of
these focal points for Great-Power conflicts.
This is one part of the world where
American and British air power and sea
power can readily be concentrated to
counteract the formidable land armies which
Russia has massed close to the Turkish
borders.
An even more forthright analysis has
been put forward by a N.Y. “Herald
Tribune” commentator:
The unique importance of the Turkish
position is that it is two-way From it .

Powers to the north. Thus the issue is

side profoundly insecure. For Turkey is
a gate which opens in two directions and
to the vital centres of the great Powers.
Nowhere else is the issue so clear and
so genuine. As compared with Trieste,
Greece, Iran, the Danube, Korea, Man-
churia, the difference is this. In no one
of these places are all the essential elements
present: namely, that the military power
of the Soviets, which is in their ground
forces, and the airland,<-sea amphibious
power of the West could come to grips and
reach the vital centres on both sides. The
Far East is important but it is too remote
from the heart of Russia and of the
Western Powers to be primary and de-
cisive- Germany is overwhelmingly impor-
tant in any settlement; but because we are
not a land Power Germany is not the place
where we can now exert directly our power.
It could be pointed out that, in sup-
porting Turkey against Russia, the U.S.
is also looking after its own present and
future commercial, oil und other direct
interests in the Middle East. In all, the
reasons for the new U.S, involvement in
that part of the world are considerable,
and should be strong enough to hold
U.S. policy steady through the peace-
making and particularly the Turkey-
Russia dispute on the stated lines of “no
more appeasement.” As seen by the
“Saturday Evening Post” writer the posi-
tion now is;
Today the issue between the United States
and the Soviet Government concerning the
Turkish straits is clearly drawn. We are
actively opposing Russia’s claim to share
with Turkey the right of fortifying and
garrisoning these straits. Notwithstanding
our announced opposition, the Russians
have reiterated their demands. Turkey
stands in the middle of this dispute, and'
the enormous sacrifices which the Turks
are enduring to resist Russian pressure are
predicated upon the belief that they can
depend absolutely on American support.
The Turks are not deluding themselves that
the United States Government has accepted
this protecting role formerly borne by
of any special love we
Americans cherish toward Turkey. The
Turks simply are confident that we have
committed ourselves so far now that we
cannot draw back.
Two other incidental causes are seen
as having their effect in keeping the Turks
steadfast in determimition not to give in
to the persistent Soviet pressure. One is
the Soviet actions in the adjoining
Balkans, on which the Turks are excep-
tionally well informed, both through their
own observations and from the accounts
of political refugees from those and
other Soviet-dominated countries who
have found sanctuary in Turkey.
Another cause has a touch of comedy
in it. Soviet propaganda broadcasts to
Turkey are seen by Demaree Bess as
having a perfect boomerang effect. There
is no Turkish ban against listening to
these broadcasts, which are on the
familiar lines of abus-
ing Britain and
America and insisting
that the world is
divided into two sec-
tors —the Soviet sector
and that of the “Anglo-
American imperialists.”
Not many Turks bother
to listen to the broad-
casts ; they prefer their
own and, like people in
most other countries,
react unfavorably to
palpable propaganda
being pumped into
them by a foreign
country. In conse-
quence “the Russian
propaganda has had
just the opposite effect
in Turkey from that in-
tended. It has per-
suaded the Turks that
the world is divided
into two sectors, but
this makes most Turks
all the more determined
to keep outside the
Russian camp.”
With the foregoing
the general position at
present, the N.Y.
“Journal - American”
has expressed the ex-
treme view that “The Russian war of
nerves upon Turkey only waits the proper
moment to break out into actual and
violent warfare.” The more general view
is that the Soviet bluff has been called,
and that, as U.S. Secretary of State,
General Marshall will not be a party to
any U.S. backing out on implied com-
mitments in the forthcoming discussions
on this particular vital quarter.
DRAGNET DIGEST.
Standing Roosevelt. —One of those London
‘Times” correspondence contests which rage
furiously sometimes for weeks and usually draw
the top authorities on the particular subject
into the fight before they’re through wound up
on January 29—this one on 'the propriety of
having the figure of President Roosevelt stand-
ing in a statue tribute to him. A letter signed
Eleanor Roosevelt concluded the discussion;
“For my part I am content with the present
standing statue, and I cannot but think it would
be wise to let the matter go forward without
further controversy.”

Repaying U.S. Loan.— When the U.S. loan
to Britain was going through it was cynically
suggested in the more anti-British American
press that it should not be a loan but a gift,
because it wouldn’t be repaid, anyway. Those
who thought so have had fresh ammunition
supplied to them by Lord Woolton, who,
addressing the Empire Industries Association
in London, said he could see no prospect of
Britain repaying. “How can the loan be re-
paid?” he asked. “As a line of credit it
implies that goods must go into America, but
the American people have so far shown no
signs that they are prepared to allow British
goods to enter their country.”
* * * »
Coals to Europe. —J. Eaton Griffith, chair-
man of the European Coal Organisation, told
a meeting of that body that, whereas before
the war Britain provided about 32 per cent,
and Germany 40 per cent, of Europe’s coal
imports, today Britain is supplying practically
none and Germany dnly 15 per cent, of the
pre-war amount. The biggest supplier is the
U.S., before the war riot a serious exporter
of coal to Europe, but today contributing about
27 per cent, of Europe’s pre-war imports, or
over 20,000,000 tons a year. About 500 Liberty
or similar ships are permanently employed
moving the U.S. coal 3000 miles across the
Atlantic Ocean to a Europe that has all the
coal it needs there under its feet.

U.N.O. Personal Touch. The human
element, of which little appears in reports of
its doings, figures at "times in U.N.O. A
correspondent of N.Y. “Times” tells of an
occasion when Byrnes and Bevin got bored
with Molotov’s tactics. The Big Four had
gone through the five peace treaties twice, each
member explaining his position on the way.
Despite that, at the start of the fourth week
of negotiation Molotov, when the first clause
came forward once more, began again on his
already twice-stated arguments. Byrnes, in
the chair, just stopped arguing; so did Bevin.
As each new treaty clause was raised Molotov
repeated the arguments he had been making
for months. Nothing but silence from Byrnes
and Bevin. At last it apparently dawned on
Molotov that he was enjoying a ride all by
himself. That evening he rang Byrnes and
proposed a private political talk. Agreeing,
Byrnes told him there was no future in end-
less repetition, and that U.S. would merely
remain in Europe where it was, and “wait
until the Soviet Union was really ready to
negotiate.” Next day, in both Security Council
and General Assembly, “rapid progress was
made,” with a quite-agreeable Molotov.

World Wine. —Despite war damage, “World
Repfirt” expects wine production to break
records this year, and “as competition grows,
pressure is likely to develop to a point that
will force prices down.” French wines are
on sale again in the U.S., Canada, Sweden,
Switzerland and Latin America ("Buyer resist-
ance is beginning to set in against the high
prices, but sales are substantial, nevertheless”).
Production in Italy is receiving British Gov-
ernment support. The, Military Governments
in Germany aim to export as much as they
pn. In order to keep wine production high
m the various European wine-producing coun-
tries vineyard workers are being kept on the
job instead of being sent to factories. Inci-
dentally, “grape acreage in the U.S. provides
wine that satisfies 95 per cent, of American
demand,” and there are U.S. moves for ex-
porting to Canada, Central America and
Scandinavia.
* * * *
U.S. Policy, No Change. —U.S. newspapers
as good as unanimously agree that the
appointment of General Marshall as Secretary
of State will mean no change in American
foreign policy. “World Report” states that
“actually, the substitution of Marshall for
Byrnes was a dramatic way of informing other
nations that the U.S. intends to play its role
as a world Power without interruption or
change.” Main points .of the policy sum-
marised from a “World Report” article: (1)
The U.S. means to stay in Europe and Asia
till the war mess has been cleared up and peace
finally settled. Marshall will, however, try to
get America’s bill for occupation and relief
further reduced. (2) U.N.O. will continue to
have unreserved U.S. co-operation, though
Marshall “sees limitations” to the idea of a
U.N.O. police force patrolling the world. (3)
Marshall, who had a share in development of
the atom bomb and in its use against Japan,
will insist that details of inspection, control
and punishment by a world agency be worked
out thoroughly and agreed to before U.S.
shares the secret with others. (4) No U S
disarmament ahead of others this time. (5)
Firmness and patience towards Russia, but no
appeasement. (6) Preventing a new Germany
or Japan “coming under the control of any
other Power.”

Restrictive Labor Legislation. —ln his N.Y.
Sun ’ column, David Lawrence notes “an
amazing parallel” between the British legis-
lation, “repealed by the Attlee Government,”
forbidding general strikes, and “the efforts of
American legislators to outlaw sympathetic
strikes and secondary boycotts.” Lawrence
comments: “In both the United States and
Great Britain the two biggest democracies of
the world—the tolerance by the public as a
whole of special groups with vote-getting poten-
tiality has led to a situation in which, in the
absence of statutes, there emerges a usurpation
of economic power in defiance of the people’s
interest. Much as the vote-conscious adminis-
trations in both Britain and the United States
may dislike it, the pendulum is swinging toward
restrictive legislation which the rank and file
of workers themselves wish to see adopted as
a , means of bringftig order out of economic
chaos. The theory that strikes injure only the
employers is being proved fallacious by the
devastating nature of the strikes that are occur-
ring in Britain and U.S. as a result of un-
restrained acts by labor union leaders.”

"SOCIALISM IN OUR TIME. "
Herbert Spencer, one of those despised
Victorians, wrote in his Map Versus
the State that the great superstition of
the past was the divine right of kings
and the great superstition of his own
age the divine right of Parliaments. To
that there has been added in our age a
blind faith in the divinely-ordained wis-
dom of socialism, and in the intuitive
efficiency of socialist parties and Govern-
ments, sometimes called “Labor.” In
Britain and Australia, though not in
Canada or South Africa, where “ ‘Labor’
principles” are held cheap, this particu-
lar superstition is being exploded very
fast.
In July, 1945, the British nation de-
clared for a “Labor” Government. Heed-
less alike of Nature and human nature,
and subordinating to its Fabian theories
the pressing necessities of a war-worn
people, ill-housed, ill-fed and in dire need
of financial help, the Government en-
tered upon a socialist programme as
blithely as the Scullin “Labor” Govern-
ment when, as its first manoeuvre, the
Scullin “Labor” Government skitfled the
defences of this country.
The Attlee Administration at once
assumed control of the coalmines, though
flag-raising and actual dispossession of
the companies and proprietors was de-
layed until the beginning of the present
year. Acquisition of Cable and Wireless
succeeded, it being given out that this
was desired in Australia —presumably by
Mr. Drakeford and Senator Don
Cameron, two minor members of an
inept “Labor” Ministry. Plans for the
“taking over” of railways, road-haulage
concerns, power plants and iron and steel
industries, with land nationalisation as a
crowning achievement, followed fast.
Almost .the only major industry excluded
from the programme was cotton-spinning,
though even here the Government
meddled injuriously, being convinced —
as “Labor” Governments are in all such
cases—that it knew more about cotton-
spinning than the cotton-spinners them-
selves.
Three very important departments,
Food, Fuel and Power and Housing, were
entrusted to three Left-Wing Ministers:
Mr. Strachey (in his case after an old-
style unionist had failed where the
“Tory” Lord Woolton had succeeded);
Mr. Aneurin Bevan, whose contempt for
the “Tories” is equalled only by the
contempt of the “Tories” for him, and
Mr. Shinwell, a fluent Jew of Polish ante-
cedents.
“Fruits” of Mr. Strachey’s admini-
stration were rationing of bread and
reduction of the fresh-meat ration to a
shillingsworth a week. Mr. f Aneurin
Sevan’s administration was marked by
an appalling lag in the production of
houses, noted recently in the annual re-
port of the British Legion—“the condi-
tions in which many thousands of men
and women who served for long periods
overseas are now housed can only be
described as deplorable, and the serious
consequences to the country need no em-
phasis.” Faced with incontrovertible
facts, Mr. Strachey and Mr. Bevan
blamed everybody but themselves, but
Mr. Shinwell cockfly insisted that he was
delivering the goods. Four months ago,
trying to allay fears as to the adequacy of
coal supplies during the winter, he said
that fears need not be entertained ; “there
is not going, td be a crisis, if by a crisis
one means that industrial organisation
will be seriously dislocated and that
hundreds of industries will have tp close.”
January, nevertheless, brought the sus-
pension of many train services and the
closing of cotton mills, factories, work-
shops and even breweries for lack of
coal. As the month drew to a close the
Yorkshire textile trade and great concerns
like General Electric, Dunlops, Imperial
Chemical Industries, Nuffields, Austins
and the Singer and Standard concerns
arranged to work part-time. And in a
burst of candor the Chancellor of the
Exchequer warned his anxious country-
men that they were “living oh tick,” and
were importing more than they were ex-
porting “only because of the credits we
are getting from the United States and
Canada” —both countries which have
emphatically rejected Daltons, Shinwells,
Stracheys and Aneurin Bevans and their
shortcuts to perfection and general happi-
ness.
“If you want to retain your pre-
sent standards of life,” the Chancellor
proceeded without mentioning what the
standards are, “you will have to make
great efforts to increase production for
the export and home markets.”
If we have to reduce imports you will
have less to eat and smoke, fewer clothes
and shoes, fewer houses, less furniture and
less employment in many industries.
To this the “Times” added that the
requirements of the debt to the U.S.A.
alone would take “the whole output of
over 600,000 British workers until after
the end of the present century” ; and
from Mr. Shinwell’s offsider came the
chilling statement that “the difficult coal
situation” was “bound to continue until
April 30 at least.”
Mr. Shinwell himself remained cocky
until General February turned traitor.*
He had “gambled on a mild winter,” and
there name instead a blizzard which swept
the country, in the process sweeping the
“Labor” heart to the “Labor” boots.
Panic measures were introduced at three
days’ notice; a blackout of hornet
offices and streets and a withdrawal of
electricity from industry for “at least a
week.” As the week wore on the situa-
tion grew worse, for a great part of the
nation worse than at any period of the
war; but the guilty and incapable
Minister still contrived to assume an ap-
pearance of self-satisfaction. Resign?
No, he wasn’t going to resign. Why
should he resign when it should be patent
that what was happening was an act of
God?
While all this was going on in Britain,
with effects which will be felt for years
and from which Australia cannot expect
to escape, students of Australian affairs
were being given abundant cause to
wonder how long it will be before a
crisis is reached in this country.
It came out that N.S.W. coal produc-
tion for five weeks of 1947 was down
192,600 tons compared with the corre-
sponding period of 1946, and that the
Miners’ Federation bosses were projecting
a general strike for a 35-hour week and
many other things, heralded by stoppages
on the South Coast. The striking Water-
side Workers’ Federation had been “in-
duced” to return to work by grants of
holiday pay (a fortnight at £8 17s. per
week) and appearance money (16s. a day)',
all of it to come out of the Common-
wealth Treasury. The A.C.T.U., of which
a Victorian “Labor” Minister, Mr. Clarey,
is president, had ordered a continent-
wide May Day strike and a general re-
fusal tp work more than 40 hours for
pay based, for the most part, on 44-hour-
week awards.
Supplementing this edict, which was
drawn up by Communists and meekly
accepted by Catholic “Labor” worthies,
the A.C.T.U. “demanded” the complete
abolition of wage-pegging ; an increase of
at least 13s. in the basic wage, plus war
and prosperity loadings of 6s. per week
each, with extension to “all workers” ; in-
creased wages for all juniors and appren-
tices ; equal pay for women, with “im-
mediate provision of 75 per cent, of the
total male rate as a minimum” ; main-
tenance of present prices of materials
and necessary commodities “affecting
living costs” ; remoulding of the Com-
monwealth Arbitration Act to A.C.T.U.
specifications, and abolition of income tax
on “the first £3OO from wages or salaries.”
And all with “nationalisation” of the
coalmines ajnd the iron and steel in-
dustries. Possibly even Mr. Shinwell
would smile grimly at that.
While an astonished public was try-
ing to digest the A.C.T.U. stuff the Act-
ing Chief Federal Arbitration Judge
stated the cost of “the recent varia-
tions to the wage-pegging regulations” as
estimated by the Commonwealth Statisti-
cal Department—£so,ooo,ooo a year.
And the Chief Staff Superintendent of
the N.S.W. Government railways gave
the cost to his concern of “the variations
and ordinary adjustments”—£l,467,ooo a
year, resulting in a certain loss to this
Government “enterprise,” already heavily
subsidised from the taxes, of £85,0,000
for the year to June 30, and that without
reckoning in claims for “penalty rates”:
time and a half for Saturday work
(£433,000 a year) and double time for
Sunday work (£238,000 a year). Another
official from N. S. Wales chipped in with
the cheery announcement that “penalty
rates” would add £307,000 p.a. to the
chronic losses on the Sydney and New-
castle trams (the world’s worst), estimated
at £600,000 this year.
Other interesting communications
came from Canberra, in each case direct
from the Statistical Department:
Customs and excise revenue for seven
months of 1946-47, £57,950,000. Increase
over the Chifley estimate for the period,
£6,000,000; increase over the correspond-
ing period of 1945-46, £15,000,000; in-
orfease over 1938-39 collections, £30,000,000.
Taxation per head in 1914, £4 155.; in
1946, £5l.
, Number of men and women in Gov-
ernment employment, November 30, 1946,
537,300 (2700 more than on Oct. 31). In
private employment, 1,629,200.
On June 30, 1939, the number of Gov-
ernment employees, part-timers included,
was 388,857.
So Australia is fast becoming a socialist
State. In a full-blown socialist State
everyone is poor and pushed around
save selected specimens of the govern-
ing class and friends, clients and crooks.

indust ries in their adolescence
such ag t i mber .getting, cocoa and rubber
production and growing of tea, coffee
and
in the higher lands, will never have a
chance to develop. There is now little
labor and less shipping.
Generally speaking, the spectacle which
these rich territories present is of a ruin,
with pedants mumbling shibboleths
among the 'wreckage. “Labor’s” terri-
torial policy, indeed, seems to be born
of the concept that all colonisation is
“imperialist” and that the object of all
“liberals” (in the American sense of the
term) should be to discomfort all white
colonists as brutal emissaries of capital-
ism, and finally get rid of them, leaving
the black population a bewildered mail
which can be moulded along the paths of
“liberalism.” The process seems to have
advanced some way already judging by
a remark of the Administrator, Colonel
Murray (no relation to Hubert Murray).
On his return to Australia Colonel
Murray observed that the New Guinea
Territory might become another Indo-
nesia if the natives were not educated
along the right lines. Certainly present
lines of education are very apt to produce
Indonesians and open up new fields for
Communists,
This is a serious matter indeed when
it is realised that any part of eastern.
Australia is now within reach of long-
distance, heavy-duty rockets from New
Guinea. From New Guinea, moreover,
the new 836 bombers, which are but a
beginning in the development of bomb-
carrying attack aircraft, could transport
the same loads to Sydney and Melbourne
that the 829 s took from the Marianas to
Tokyo, and that ip less time. It is already
possible for an enemy holding New
Guinea to subject southern Australian
cities to the same sort of fire treatment
as Japanese cities were subjected to in
1945.
Yet the Australian “Government” in
its fatuousness is helping to create condi-
tions favorable to the detachment of the
loyalty of the and to the im-
planting in their primitive minds of ideas
of independence which can end only in
their dependence upon others less
humane, and certainly unfriendly to Aus-
tralia and the English-speaking races.
It will be rather surprising if there
is not among the theorists selected to
carry on the work of introducing New
Guinea to Wardian principles a section
with Red ideas. It has been so in
U.N.R.R.A., where Red-ants in the or-
ganisation in Yugoslavia virtually handed
it over to the Russian delegate, whose
country was contributing no resources
save himself.
Other countries are not unaware of
what is going on in New Guinea and in
the Pacific. Had plans been made dur-
ing the war for the restoration of the
New Guinea copra and other industries,
those territories would have been so far
ahead that they would not have had cause
to feaj tti£ competition of British African
colonies. Fiscal and exchange reasons
would have been sufficient to induce
Britain to give the New Guinea oil in-
dustry basic support, and to help it to
develop. As it is, Britain is financing a
plan to take 3,250,000 acres of “barren
and largely empty” ground in Tan-
ganyika, Northern Rhodesia and Kenya
and turn it to the production of ground-
nuts.
The scheme was born in the minds of
directors of the United Africa Company,
details being the work of a committee
drawn from half-a-dozen sources. It is
proposed to create 107 units, each of
30,000 acres, and -to c.arry out a five-year
development plan, which will be heavily
mechanised and run on large-scale
private-enterprise lines. It will provide
work for 1249 Europeans and 57,100
natives.
For the agricultural side Britain is pro-
viding £23,000,000 —another £2,500,000
will be spent on port and rail develop-
ment. The ground-nuts will be delivered
shelled at a cost of £l7 Bs. per ton at
port.
For the improvement of native con-
ditions this scheme will do more in five
years than a millennium of jargon about
“native dignity” and “human rights”
could achieve in our island territories. It
specifically “recognises native rights
in the land.” Incidental to it are im-
proved water supplies, health measures,
technical training and, of course, multi-
plied circulation of money—all designed
to create new native standards within a
few years. And it will be a “pilot
plant” which, when in full operation, is
likely to revolutionise Central African
methods of agriculture and production.
Having regard to the almost untouched
productive capacity of tropical and sub-
tropical Africa, so close to Europe, what
is taking place there should prove a
danger signal to the clumsy shufflers of
Canberra. There is* nothing which Aus-
tralia can produce, even wool, which
Africa cannot produce just as well. Pub-
lication of the Kenya-Rhodesia plan—
and of another for the electrification of
Rhodesia —coincided with the King’s
departure for South Africa. It was no
fortuitous coincidence, Mr. Chifley 1.


PLAIN ENGLISH
Many More Calvell Boys.
Scared by public reactions to the arrival
of the Hwa Lien from Shanghai with 300
European Jews, alleged victims of the
Nazi terror, though they were decidedly
not penniless and all had accommodation
provided for them in advance, Mr. Cal-
well announced that no more landing
permits would be issued on “humani-
tarian” grounds. People who have made
a study of the workings of his crooked
mind, as expressed in statements which
conceal, misrepresent and prevaricate,
looked for nasty sequels, and in that
sense they were not disappointed.
To Sydney came another party of Jews
from Central Europe, 210 this time, after
a roundabout voyage in a French motor-
ship, the Monkay. They also found
accommodation awaiting them, though
vast numbers of men and women of the
three services can’t get it. A day or two
later it came out that 955 more Jews
(600 to the Minister) were on their way
to Australia from Marseilles in the Dutch
liner Johan de Witt, and it was stated that
thousands more could be expected in the
next few months.
Mr. Calwell denied the thousands, for
what his denial may be worth, and went
through the motions of declaring that
ships' carrying refugees from European
ports would in future be limited to a 25
p.c. proportion of Jews. It is beyond his
power to impose any such limit unless he
cancels the equivalent landing permits in
advance; and, according to Australia
House, “about 10,000 persons” have
them. In the case of the Johan de Witt
“refugees” the Minister pleaded that their
“landing permits” were “issued more than
a year ago,” an obvious inference being
that they were issued by somebody else.
But it is much more than a year since
he became Minister of Immigration.
Nearly 17 months, in fact.
If it is possible to imagine this Minis-
ter denying admission to Jews flourishing
his landing permits, they may throw
bottles and iron bars, as a shipload of
other Jews making for Haifa did when
their blockade-runner was boarded by
bluejackets. Meantime the two leading
Jewish organisations in Palestine have
refused the British Government’s request
for co-operation against terrorism, and
American Jews continue to arm and
finance the terrorists, at the same time de-
nouncing Britain in the terms they applied
to Hitler when they were waging a paper
war against him—their only one ; no
Irgun gang or Stern gang fought the Nazis.
Parliament meets today. The Opposi-
tion should at once move for a select com-
mittee to go into ths whole matter of
Jewish immigration. Apart from the
obvious danger of creating an alien
problem by introduction of foreign Jews
in numbers sufficient to swamp the Aus-
tralian-born Jewish community—and
among them there are certain to be many
Communists, if not others with terrorist
sympathies—the business has an ugly look
and a rank sniell. In three or four
months there will have come to Australia
nearly twice as many foreign Jews as the
number of British immigrants assigned, to
any of the States for the whole of 1947,
Blustering in his corner, the Minister
is trying to make the public believe
that he will bring out heaps more
Britons in the Aquitania ; but it tran-
spires that he hasn’t got the Aquitania,
though he said he had. Nor is he likely
to get it if the charter means adding to
the desperate plight of the British Gov-
ernment, which, in that case, will have to
find full passage-money (over £lOO a
head) for ex-servicemen and half passage-
money for other immigrants. It cannot
afford the money or the loss of popula-
tion ; but what does Calvell care?
•'Rain Has Fallen. 11
Last week good rain fell over drought-
stricken parts of Queensland and N. S.
Wales, coming when many land men in
both States had about reached the end
of their tether. Against the black picture
of drought the failure of three-fourths of
the N.S.W. wheat crop and nearly the
whole of the Queensland one would be
bad enough if it stood alone. Bbt there
were crop failures) in previous years, and
in previous years likewise a frightful and
continuing mortality among stock, par-
ticularly sheep. It needs little imagina-
tion to realise what the rains mean to
land men.
But imagination isn’t evident around
the Commonwealth’s legislative halls and
administrative offices. For all the notice
the Chifley Government took of the
blasted crop and stock country it might
just as well not have existed.
The Chifleys have to see that wharfies
a nd coa lies and transport-workers and
all the rest have their hours reduced, their
wages increased and their holidays ex-
panded, while rate of output diminishes.
They have “Labor” politicians to get
appointed to all sorts of jobs from a
C.S.LR. “adviser” to the Governor-
Generalship. And there are the A.C.T.U.
and the Communists to be placated. Why
worry about the land? The fellows out
there will work and hang on anyhow
and, now that they’ve had rain, grow
some more wheat and breed some more
stock. Besides, they’re not unionists.
Well, luckily for all of us, the land
men will battle on. And for those battlers
the rain has come like a gift from heaven.
The McKell Referendum.
Since Mr. W. J. McKell, the 1914-18 non-
starter, was named Governor-General
designate, he has had facer after facer.
There was, first, the failure of his
attempt to foist Mr. Heffrqn on his party
and State as Premier —Mr. Heffron, who
in other days took the Red line and
bitterly attacked Britain. Then came the
R.S.L.'-executive resolution: “the appoint-
ment of an active politician as
Governor-General lowers the prestige
and dignity of the office,” and “the ap-
pointment of a non-serviceman as C.-in-C.
brings that office into ridicule and con-
tempt and is an insult to all servicemen.”
Mr. McKell did not take the platform
for 10-o’clock closing of bars ; but the
impression that he was in favor of it —as
it were, willing to wound but afraid to
strike—must have contributed to its de-
feat in the constituencies.
It was not only defeated but routed.
Except in mining districts like Broken
Hill and Cobar and in parts of Sydney
such as King, Phillip and Woollahra, the
constituencies voted nearly 2 to 1 against
“IT ISN’T RAINING RAIN TODAY”
“The A.C.T.U. has served an ultimatum on Mr. Chifley Mr. McGirr has sanctioned
the prosecution of Mr. McKell’s Turf Club for unauthorised building on one of its race-
courses, part of the material having come from the Government brickyards.”
10 o’clock. Morning- and Sunday-paper
support for 10 o’clock and a king’s ran-
som spent in radio advertising—supposed
in credulous circles to have magical
properties—went for nothing.
Disgruntled parties allege that the
women’s vote did the business ; and cer-
tainly the “Women Weekly” foiled most
conspicuously to swing it to 10 o’clock.
But in Sydney electorates where females
predominate, not only Woollahra and
King, but Vaucluse, Bondi, Newtown,
Randwick and Waverley, the “Women’s
Weekly” may have made some appeal to
frustrated cocktailers; anyway, in those
electorates and others of the kind there
was a higher proportionate vote for 10
o’clock than in electorates where the sexes
are almost equally divided. In metropoli-
tan and country divisions alike men de-
cided the issue, and many of them were
actuated by a grim desire to get even
with the Trade for its behavior during
the war and since. p
This question of bar-closing hours
should never have been put to the electors
at a costly referendum. It is essentially
a Government responsibility, as has been
accepted in other States, even the
“Labor” States of Queensland, Wes-
trafia and Tasmania. By shirking it and
putting through a pro-Trade Liquor Act
Mr. McKell has enabled the Drys to
claim a victory and give them a case for
demanding local-option polls, as fore-
runners of prohibition polls. Passing the
buck has become a “ ‘Labor’ principle,”
but in the long run it never pays.
The "Sport's" Paradise.
A special box, windowed and up-
holstered, which any of the thousands of
houseless servicemen would have been
glad to have for a home was fitted up
for Bernborough so that the animal might
make the Pacific crossing in comfort.
Presumably a “Labor” concession to the
owner, Mr. A. O. Romano, a promoted
Italian waiter , who arrived in Australia
under another name which in process of
time he changed by deed poll.
Mr. Romano, previously Azzalin,
seems to have been hailed in New York
by the “Herald Tribune” as a representa-
tive Australian.
He is so much of an Australian and
so representative that in October, 1939,
he was fined £5OO for income-tax cheat-
ing, being required under the income-tax
law to pay an additional penalty of
£5320; over a period of years he had
“understated” £38,000 of income. Be-
fore he set out for the U.S.A. he cut a
figure on racecourses taken over by the
Sydney Turf Club, the war-time creation
of Mr. IVjcKell, who has become Gover-
nor-General designate by the grace of
Mr. Chifley.
This Sydney Turf Club has vast plans
for another racecourse in the Lakes
region, which will mean the expulsion of
golf clubs and is attended with certain
industrial and aerodrome complications.
Meantime it has become involved in a
lawsuit with the dispossessed Rosehill
club, and in more summary proceedings
in consequence of allegations that it
made an unauthorised use of building
materials and labor sufficient for many
dwellings,- the bricks coming from the
“Labor” Government brickworks, on the
racecourse which is to be the subject of
the other action.
During the war at least two Randwick
bookmakers carried out unauthorised
building programmes on their own ac-
count. Last week a third Randwick
bookmaker was fined £5O for having de-
manded and received £lO for the key of
a house as a condition of tenancy.
In Melbourne, by way of accommodat-
ing the Davis Cup crowds, the A.L.T.A.
was permitted to build temporary stands
conditionally on their being dismantled
after the matches and used for housing
purposes. Straightway it was suggested
that the materials would be carted to
the Showground to “facilitate” the intro-
duction of night trotting, a reform de-
cided upon by the “Labor” Government
in furtherance of its policy of making the
community enlightened and self-reliant.
Truly “Labor” is the party of the
“Sport’s” soul —that is, if the “sport” has
a soul.
The Answer's a Lemmon.
Mr. LEMMONy who succeeded Mr. H. P.
Lazzarini as the Chifley Minister for
Housing, found the position so distressing
that he summoned a conference of Com-
monwealth and State housing authorities.
Mr. Lemmon re-echoed his leader’s com-
plaints about the high cost of housing,
particularly in N. S. Wales, and then let
himself go:
Between £60,000,000 and £80,000,000 will
be spent through the Commonwealth-State
housing scheme in the next ten years.
On present estimates we shall have 40,000
completed houses in 1948 The aim for
the year to Jtlne 30 next is 42,000 houses
i under construction, including between 14,000
/ and 15,000 Government houses The
( number expected to be completed by June
is between 20,000 and 25,000.
The wars ended in August, 1945. Mr.
Lemmon had to admit that only 6300
houses had been built and 7050 were
under construction by last December —
if he was quoting from State figures he
must have included thousands of con-
verted army huts. There has been no
noticeable increase in output of construc-
tion materials, in numbers engaged in
building, or in the rate of work in the
past year; on the contrary. Communist
strikes and go-slow and Government
“controls” have cut both work and
materials to the bone. Yet the man ex-
pects to multiply the quoted figures in
six months!
As for costs, apart from, their climb-
ing tendencies, what with shorter hours,
wage increases and so forth, the extra-
ordinary differences between the States
should excite this Mr. Lemmon:
State. 2 bedrooms. 3 bedrooms.
Per square for brick:
New South Wales .. £l4O £l3O
Victoria 131 122
Queensland .. .. 125 120
South Australia 95 90
Tasmania .. .. (mainly timber)
West Australia 95 87
Per square for timber: —
New South Wales .. £l3O £ll6
Victoria 116 113
Queensland .. .. 105 105
South Australia .. (brick)
Tasmania .... 95
West Australia 96 85
Bad as those figures are, and unfortu-
nate in their bearing on politics in South
Australia, where the one Liberal Govern-
ment is going to the country, they
brought snorts of derision from Mr.
Pooley, of the Co-op. Building
Society, and Mr. Stewart Fraser, of the
Building Industry Congress. “A hundred
and forty pounds a square,” said Mr.
Pooley, an able and active man. “Why, a
hundred and fifty-five would be nearer the
mark ; but fluctuating costs make it im-
possible to strike an average.” Mr.
Fraser said current Housing Commission
costs in N.S.W. are “nearer £l6O a
square”:
The official figures ignore the high over-
head of Government housing. Apparently
not even the Auditor-General can find out
* the real cost of State houses.
All of which suggests that this new
Federal Housing Minister suffers from
the prevailing illusion of “Labor” Minis-
ters, which is that all is for the best in
the best of all worlds because they are
in office.
Two Men: Four Jobs.
Although the A.W.U. and the A.C.T.U.
are at variance on the May-Day strike
proposal and other matters of “policy,”
the presidents of the two organisations
are in complete agreement when it comes
to disregarding the old doctrine, “One
man, one job.”
Mr. P. J. Clarey, president of the
A.C.T.U., leads for Victorian “Labor” in
the Leg. Council and is Minister of Labor
and Employment. In his capacity of
Minister he was doubtless interested to
receive his own May-Day strike ultima-
tum delivered as A.C.T.U. president.
Mr. H. V. Johnson, president of the
A.W.U., is “Labor” M.H.R. for Kal-
goorlie and Minister for the Interior.
The propriety of this gentleman hold-
ing both union and Ministerial posts hav-
ing been questioned, he came out with a
justification which boiled down to “It
must be all right, because I like it that
way.” This at an A.W.U. conference.
Reported in the third person by “S. M.
Herald,” Mr. Johnson said: —•
He had been associated with the union
all his working life and would not like
to sever his official connection with it.
This is understandable.
He had discussed with the general sec-
retary, Mr. T. Dougherty, and many dele-
gates the wisdom of carrying on as presi-
dent while he could give only limited time
to the position.
In effect, Mr. Johnson discussed the
matter not with constitutional lawyers,
not with anyone who might consider it
from a national viewpoint, but merely
with officials of the union concerned.
And he discussed not the ethics of the
position, not the moral implications of a
Minister of the Crown holding office in
an organisation which from its very
nature might, and in the past has, come
into conflict with the department he ad-
ministers, but merely the “wisdom” from
the union’s point of view of' having a
part-time president.
There is no suggestion that senior
officers of the Department of the Interior
were consulted as to the “wisdom” of
having a part-time Minister. A part-time
Minister he must be, for the A.W.U. is a
big union and makes many calls on its
president.
He was, however, able to keep in touqh
with Mr. Dougherty by telephone almost
daily.
Mr, Dougherty’s headquarters are in
Sydney. The cost of a trunk call between
Canberra and Sydney ’ is approximately
3s. for each three minutes, so “almost
daily” calls, with the extensions that
would surely be necessary, would amount
to a tidy sum in the course of a year.
This is no doubt gratifying to the P.M.G.,
but it would be interesting to know
whether the calls are booked by Mr.
Dougherty or Mr. Johnson. If the latter,
it would be interesting to know what
arrangements have been made for Jhe
apportionment of the Minister’s trunk-
line bill between the Department of the
Interior and the A.W.U.
And there is the matter of free travel.
Mr. Johnson has a Ministerial car and a
railway pass. They were not given to
him for use on A.W.U. business.
If he had to decide between the positions
he would remain union president.
With this part of Mr. Johnson’s state-
ment there can be no quarrel. But the
choice should be imposed on him.

MADE SPECIALLY TO PREVENT SORE THROATS
POLITICAL POINTS
Parliament is to open today (February
19), but the swearing-in of the McKelly
who is to be part of the legislative and
executive apparatus- has been delayed
till March 10. The advent of a new
Governor-General means a ne\y session,
which gives an opportunity for a recast-
ing of programmes. The “Government”
has a natural reluctance to spring its new
instrument on Parliament too suddenly
lest fellows like Archie Cameron make
his appearance the occasion for re-
marks more memorable than polite. And
in the chaotic state of Caucus, the unions
and the country, the Chifleys would natur-
ally dodge the issue of a new “speech
from the Throne,” with a consequent un-
inhibited Address-in-reply debate, in
which there would be little chance of
gagging the, Opposition or J. T. Lang.
There were some odd groupings at
McKell’s cocktail referendum. For six-
o’clock closing were one of the two
unions immediately concerned (Liquor
Trades) and a section of publicans —.
presumably with free houses—as well as
Church leaders and the Temperance Alli-
ance. For 10 o’clock were the other
union (Hotel, Club and Restaurant Em-
ployees), the two morning papers, two
butters-in from Tasmania (“Labor”
Premier Cosgrove and Dr. Gaha, “Labor”
M.H.R.), a Sunday paper or two, the
Communist party and its “Tribune” and
—yes —the “ Women’s Weekly Morgan,
the alert young man who attends to the
Gallup polls, predicted a 63 p.c. vote
for six o’clock. It was exactly that on
Monday, though polling and counting
were not complete.
One of the humorous features of Mc-
Kell’s liquor referendum was that the
only clear Sydney majority for 10
o’clock was registered in Opposition-
leader Treatt’s electorate of Woollahra.
It takes in parts of Darlinghurst and
Paddington as well as Woollahra, Wool-
lahra West, Darling Point, Edgecliff. and
Double Bay and has a predominantly
feminine population—females, 18,755 ;
males, 12,072 ; majority for 10 o’clock
(Monday), 888. Treatt is entitled to con-
clude that there were sufficient “S. M.
Herald,” “Daily Telegraph,” “Sunday
Telegraph” a’nd Communist “Tribune”
people in the neighborhood to give 10
o’clock its majority. ,
Widening of the membership of the
R.S.L. is to be referred to a poll of
members in all the States and the A.C.T.
The special Federal congress, meeting at
Melbourne, was divided on the member-
ship issue, but it was united on the Mc-
Kell appointment, which it condemned in
shattering terms.
There is a tradition that Joseph Cook
wrote “J.C.” in the margin of one of the
treaties he signed at Versailles, and if
the peace treaty with Italy required
initialling Beasley must have come to
light with a “J.A.8.” The ceremony was
followed by the shooting of a British
brigadier by an Italian woman at Pola,
Wars settle nothing, and wrapped up in-
visibly in the parchment of the instru-
ments in which Russia has had its way
with Jtaly, Hungary, Rumania, Bulgaria
and Finland, the checks being unim-
portant, were the seeds of future wars.
The new Consul-General for Syria has
presented Doc Evatt with a piece of
timber from a cedar of Lebanon. Cal-
vell’s Rose of Sharon is expected any
day now.
A generous fellow is the American
When his heart is moved and he can see
a problem plain. The moment he learned
of Britain’s fuel extremity his thoughts
turned to prompt aid, and the noses of
the Zionists who have been carrying on a
furious and most expensive anti-British
campaign were forthwith put out of joint.
From the White House came the voice of
a true man indeed: “The United States
Government stands ready to do every-
thing in its power to relieve the plight
of the British people.” And thanks to
the strength of purpose the President
showed when he had become a figure of
fun to the wits of both parties, the United
States Government can do much. Coal
production has been so great since Tru-
man broke the strike that the U.S.A. has
11,000,000 tons a month for export.
Had what is happening in Britain hap-
pened in the winter of 1904-05 Australia
could be helping with coal. In 1905 N. S.
Wales exported 23,348 tons of cargo coal
to Britain, as well as selling it large quan-
tities of bunker coal, “included” in the
record with “that used for home con-
sumption.” That year also it exported
100,705 tons of cargo coal to the U.S.A.,
and upwards of a million tons to more
than a score of other countries. Since
selfishness came in with socialistic ideas,
all that trade has disappeared. It could
be revived, and may have to be.
It doesn’t seem long since the first
Australian troops reached Kure, but the
8.C.0.F. had its first anniversary on
Thursday. The occasion brought a
majestic compliment from General Mac-
Arthur (“the units have shown themselves
as splendid in peace as they were in war ;
they are discharging their mission here
with lasting credit to the nations they
represent”), to which our own General
Robertson replied in a manly strain. He
is losing a British infantry brigade and
“a proportionate number of administra-
tive troops,” recalled for more urgent
duties elsewhere.
There was a strike of 100 prisoners in
Pentridge (Vic.) last week, two of the ring-
leaders being long-sentence gunmen. The
first mass defiance of authority for 25
years, it was said to be dictated by a dis-
taste for the food, which is the same for
warders as for internees. A note signed
“the Majority” declared that 90 per cent,
of the prisoners did not want to refuse
work, but had “through weakness of will-
power allowed themselves to be forced
into it. ...the spokesmen are self-
appointed. ~ .Please do not punish every-
body, but do remoye this element of un-
rest. .. .do this and contentment will re-
sult.” It added, “Remove the tooth and
you remove the trouble.” Reads like a
grotesque reflection on certain events
outside.
Precious as they were and are, the
drought-breaking rains in pastoral
country will mean outbreaks of worms
and other internal parasites of stock and
blowfly attacks oi\ sheep. Firms anxious
to supply medicines to cope with the
onset of the pests find they can’t get
supplies because a strike of Communist-
led workers at the. L£.l. chemical works
has held up production for four months
and imports from America are forbidden.
Perfumes for “men” are allowed, but not
trifles like stock medicines and spectacle
frames and mountings.
South Australia reopened its Food for
Britain fund with a public meeting in
Adelaide Town Hall, and its Govern-
ment will subsidise public donations on a
pound-for-pound basis up to £lO,OOO.
The Opposition has given unqualified sup-
port. S.A. launched the original appeal
and kept it going in spite of Dedman and
Food-Controller snarls.
It isn’t all pie succeeding Federal
“Labor” Ministers. Lemmon, who fol-
lowed Lazzarini into Housing, has been
forced to admit that outrageous building
costs, particularly in N.S.W., threaten dis-
aster to the Commonwealth - States
scheme. Then, just when everybody
thought a little wholesome frankness was
about to blossom the man suggested the
banning of repairs. Hasn’t he heard of
the storm damage in Sydney on New
Year’s' Day? There have been fatal acci-
dents in cases where householders tried
to do some patching on their owp ac-
count.
Playford, first of the four Premiers to
get off a policy speech—S.A. votes on
March 9 —has been nine years in the job,
carrying on the last year or so with the
help of Independents. State of parties
when the dissolution arrived was 18
Liberal-Country League, 18 Labor and
the aforesaid three. When this was written
the L.C.L. was unopposed in 11 seats,
and Labor in four. The four Com-
munists prepared to lose their deposits
had chosen Labor seats for the sacrifice.
There was a disposal sale at Mt.
Gravatt (Q.) last week and several
civilians bought unwanted General Grant
tanks at £lO to £25 each. They cost the
country £35,000 each. Those who paid
for them are never likely to know just
how the cost was made up.
To Communist brigandage there is no
end. In November a Communist break-
away mob from the A.W.U. declared the
Merlin (Q.) clip ’“black,” alleging that
the sheep had scabby-mouth. As a result
the Storemen and Packers twice refused to
handle the clip'—B4 bales—but when the
matter got to the Industrial Court their
secretary told the Court his union had
been misled by the Communists, and the
ban was lifted. • Last week a British ship
was loading 26,000 bales of wool in Bris-
bane for Genoa and Liverpool. Wharf-
laborers—their union is Communist-
bossed —declared three (3) of the bales
“black,” alleging them to be part of the
Merlin clip. Of the same wharflaborers
Fadden has noted that in five weeks “they
received £6848 for doing nothing”—from
the “Government,” of course.
Moved by the arrival of two more
parties of Calwell Jews, and by the
obvious unpopularity of the whole busi-
ness, Finnan, the new N.S.W. Immigra-
tion Minister, intimated that he was “per-
turbed at the appreciable flow,” and that
he would like to be informed as to the
number of Calwell landing permits, par-
ticularly as they had a bearing on the
housing situation, which—though he
didn’t, say so —grows no better very fast.
Calwell replied with his familiar bluster,
and after a few exchanges Finnan weak-
ened perceptibly. • The controversies of
“Labor” Ministers are rarely interesting.
They generally resolve themselves into a
question of which party to the argument
will out-face or out-bluff the other.
A Queensland magistrate has laid it
down that any decent unionist called a
“scab” without cause has redress at law.
Three coalminers sued the president of
the Queensland Colliery Employees, one
Millar, for having said in public:
Roughrigg [meaning the miners there]
“scabbed” in 1940 and as far as I can see
will “scab” at any time. The names of
the “scabs” will be broadcast throughout
the Commonwealth and while I am presi-
dent I will see that the “scabbing” is not
forgotten.
The defamed men were each awarded
£25 and costs. So even the present law
gives the honest an 4 decent Australian
unionist some protection against union-
boss larrikinism, though not nearly
enough.
When Communists entered a house
at Eagle Farm, Brisbane, and established
an allegedly homeless family in it, nobody
expected any action from the Common-
wealth “Government,” which owns the
building, it being notoriously scared of
Communists. But when Corns took forc-
ible possession of the old South Brisbane
Town Hall Queenslanders began asking
their “Labor” Government if there isn’t
a State law against breaking and enter-
ing and why it isn’t enforced. An awk-
ward question for the Hanlons, especially
in an election year.
At the broadcasting inquiry Hutchison
asked thfc A.B.C. chairman, “Isn’t it a
fact that if the ‘A.B.C. Weekly’ and the
independent news service were dropped
the Commission’s financial position
would be sound?” A fair enough ques-
tion, but there was no reply.
Having failed to persuade Jews and
Arabs to agree to any sort of settlement,
Bevin is taking the Palestine question to
U.N.O. There militant Jews the world
over will learn what it means to have
lost Jewry’s best friend,
Molotov has had the effrontery to com-
plain of remarks made during the purely
domestic proceedings of a U.S. Senate
committee. Asked Senator McKellar,
“Don’t you think Russia would have an-
nexed Europe and the world if she had
had the atom bomb?” The question was
addressed to Dean Acheson, Deputy Sec-
retary of State and at one time rated a
“good liberal,” and he replied “The foreign
policy of Russia is aggressive and expan-
sionist.” Molotov had better take care.
Bevin and Truman might object to
Moscow’s persistent propaganda, which,
with war-time intermissions, has gone
on for 30 years, and is to the general
effect that Britain and the United States
are bipod-drinking, aggressive, terrorist,
imperialist Powers whose Governments
should be overthrown by force.
Tolls charged at the Government-built
Story Bridge have for years past pre-
vented its proper use for relieving con-
gestion of city traffic. Greater Brisbane’s
sewerage liability has been too heavy to
admit of adequate extension. Premier
Hanlon and Lord Mayor Chandler dis-
cussed the question and arrived at a
settlement. The Story Bridge is to be
vested in the City Council, which will
operate it on a toll-free basis. The
council’s sewerage liability to the State
is to be reduced by £J,808,978, so that
an early start may be made an substan-
tial improvements and extensions. Be-
cause of Canberra’s war-time benevo-
lence the Queensland “Labor” Govern-
ment is rolling in money.
Clarey, the A.C.T.U. president and
prospective nation-wide-strike leader, is
Cain’s Minister of Labor and Employ-
ment and as such pledged to work for
peace. So is Kennedy, Federal
secretary of the A.L.P. organisation, who
is Cain’s Minister of Works and other
things. During the gas strike, when
Clarey and Kennedy were Ministers one
moment and strike champions the next,
McLaren, M.L.A. for Glen Iris, averred
in a letter to Cain that they “should re-
sign immediately one or other of their
conflicting jobs and stop pretending to
be negotiating for class peace.” A formal
acknowledgment from the Premier’s
secretary has been McLaren’s only reply.
It came out in evidence before the
Parliamentary Standing Committee on
Broadcasting that A.B.C. had been hock-
ing its assets to make ends meet, or at
least come within radar-eye distance of
each other. The chairman, R. J. F. Boyer,
answering questions about the projected,
“independent” news service, made a
couple of remarks that seem rather diffi-
cult to reconcile. He told Spender
that the news-service suggestion did not
originate from A.8.C.: “the direction
came from the Government.” Replying
to another question he spoke of the bene-
fit the public would derive from the inde-
pendent service and added “A.B.C. might
as well be disbanded if it were to lose its
independence.” Direction? Indepen-
dence? /
A Sydney Sunday paper asserts that
Australian High Commissioners are to be
raised to the status of Ambassadors. An-
other step towards cutting the painter?

“Sports” were, perturbed at the week-
end by a cabled report that Romano had
sliced his ears down to half natural size
with a razor, allegedly because he was
tired of hearing jokes about their length.
They breathed freely again on finding
that the self-mutilator was one Romano
Pandolfi, a 19-year-old youth, and not
Azzalin. They might have known; the
slasher was obviously thin-skinned and
no-one would ever accuse Bernie’s friend
of that.

"AND IT'S PRINTED
WITH WIMBLES INKS"
“Jasby”; Several generations of readers
of Gulliver’s Travels have smiled over
the war that broke out because one nation
of midgets cut their eggs at the big
end and the other at the little end. 1
won’t be surprised if one of these days
a bitter civil war flares up over a some-
what similar matter —the question of
what to do with the tapped end of a
cigarette, if and when tapped. Watch one
man savagely tapping the end of his
tailormade' on the table; he puts the
tapped end into his mouth. Watch
another and you’ll see him light that end.
Some mass-observation people carried
out some investigations in Britain a few
years ago. Of tappers interviewed 52
per cent, put the tapped end in their
mouths, 21 per cent, the untapped end'.
The other 27 per cent, had no fixed
preference, and apparently just tapped
because they felt it was the right thing
to do. The tapped-enders claimed their
method was correct —they didn’t like the
weed working loose in their mouths ;’the
untapped-enders were just as emphatic—
they found that the tapped end burnt
more evenly. As for myself, I tap both
ends, then break the fag in two and
smoke each half separately. It’s a matter
of habit and sentiment —I cut my smok-
ing teeth on bumpers.

“Niloc”: Human beings should not be
taught to speak until they are old enough
to know better. As soon as a child’s eyes
open the parents begin poiiAig at one
another to show the new amval which
will spoil it and which will spank it.
Then they spend a year or’more teaching
it to talk, and other years trying to make
it shut up. A little minx who travels
in our bus has reached the trying stage,
and seems to be training her parents
for the next national quiz. A woman
climbed aboard wearing an assortment of
finery under a long flowing eveningrcoat.
The little girl stopped in her query about
“Why is this a bus?” and bellowed
“Daddy, what is that lady bearing her
dressing-gown for?” % We passed three
stops before the driver had sufficient
strength to apply his brakes.

“H.A.L.”; Adelaide is getting rid of
its piecarts by refusing to renew their
licences as they fall due ; today only the
one outside the G.P.O. is left. A pity ;
for they supplied a cheap and filling
supper. You could have your choice of
pie, pasty, baked potato, hot dog or a
“floater” —a plate of peas with a pie in it
—with tea, coffee or cocoa. And
ardund those carts you could get
plenty of laughs; I remember a
drunk coming up, calling for a floater,
paying for it, then tipping the whole
thing into his overcoat pocket, with the
explanation that he would “have it at
home for supper.” Piecarts figured largely
in the jokes played by the young bloods
of 50 years ago ; one of them tied a pie-
cart to the back of a cab with a neck-
rope, jumped into the cab, handed the
cabby half a sovereign and told him to
“drive like hell to the station.” Off
went cab, followed by the piecart,
scattering crockery, pies, hot peas and
gravy along King William-street. Another
joker took a piecart from its shed and
left it in the centre of Government
House lawn.

“0.R.”: The Royal New Zealand Air
Force has entered the freight and pas-
senger business to such an extent that
other .services are almost completely
dwarfed. First beginnings took shape a
year ago when returned men, taking wives
and mothers on an optional three-months
rail-free tour of the Shivery Islands,
found the inter-island ferry steamers in-
adequate. Air Force pilots under train-
ing ran their Dakotas across on a daily
service; and the R.T.O. arranged accom-
modation. The privilege was extended
to businessmen, for a consideration. In
the next step, of course, the paying public
had priority, and now the privilege of
free travel has been abolished. With
legislation passed under which the only
competitor will be a different branch of
the Government service, there has been
no kick.

“Hamer”: A Sydney writer who de-
scribed a Harbor City fog as “a regular
pea-souper, as thick as any I remember
in London,” must have forgotten what a
genuine London pea-souper is like. My
most vividly recollected experience was
“Must be allergic to moths.”
of one when I was a kid. To find our
way home my mentors took a cab from
the station ; its driver found the way by
keeping his wheels in grating contact
with the kerb; crossing a street to find
the kerb continuation was an adventure,
and a half-mile -journey took over an
hour. When the driver got down to find
the carriage gates of our home he lost
his cab and our shouts had to guide him
back to it. The feel of the gravel of the
carriage drive under his feet as the Jehu
led his horse simplified the rest of the
journey. The cabby was entertained in
the kitchen; later we heard that in his,
effort to get his cab home he had lost
his way completely and had finally
camped in his vehicle a mile off his right
bearings, until the fog cleared. If Sydney
has ever had a fog that was even an
approach to that, I must have been asleep
the day it happened.

“C. 8,”: Melbourne Army Disposals
people have had some queer requests
since they started business, but they were
knocked endways the other day when a
woman approached them and asked if
they had “any surplus soldiers” to dis-
pose of. Officials swear that she was
quite serious.

“Melbn”; A recent art development
in Melbourne is the manifesto of twelve
young painters who call themselves the
Holly Brotherhood, after the name of a
cafe where they foregather to eat, drink
and discuss artistic problems. They
propose to sally out into the fields to
paint landscapes, the works to be hung
on the walls of the cafe for all to see and
buy, if they want to. Each member
will have the right to hold one exhibition
a year and occupy the walls with his in-
spirations for one month. This is some-
what on the lines of certain cafes in Paris,
the rendezvous of some of the most dis-
tinguished painters in that city, but
men with reputations already established.
The Melbourne example sounds a bit too
much like young men rushing their work
into exhibition before they have acquired
sufficient knowledge of their job, but
there’s always the hope that there may
be a genius among them.

“Chevroford”: There are more ways
than one of achieving fame in Mel-
bourne. Councillor McPhillamy, of Kew,
achieved it overnight by announcing that
he would like all the street trees in the
city chopped down, not excepting the
almost sacred avenue in St. Kilda-road.
Many councillors probably share his
opinion even if they don’t make it
vocal, but Councillor McP. makes no
bones about it. He says that street trees
provide shelter for thugs and crooks,
who leap out to bash honest citizens or
molest their wives and daughters. The
logical corollary is to demolish the
Fitzroy, Botanic and other gardens, level
the houses to the ground and turn the
suburbs into plains where any sly-grog
seller, blackmarketeer or hold-up man
could be seen a mile off.

“Bo”: For the most idiotic form of
advertising I pass the palm to the display
of dold-tea-ffiled “dummies” in show-
cases outside pubs. One ornate hostelry
which tens of thousands of Sydney train
travellers pass every day runs to 100 or
more. The only persons I have ever
seen gazing at the frauds have been red-
rimmed-eyed no-hopers who obviously
would drink beer through an oily rag.
When the inevitable Saturday-afternoon
brawl starts the “dummy” showcase is
the first thing to cop it, for which the
plate-glass trade must be perpetually
grateful. There arp still optimists who
think the bottles are wrapped around
the dinkum stuff despite the notices re-
futing the suggestion. After all, when a
fellow is half-shot and the pub is shut,
and an amber-filled bottle is there in-
vitingly behind a thin sheet of glass—
well, is it any wonder it goes off? I’ll
bet the advertisement showing a brawny
blacksmith about to down a pint of suds
has set more men to thinking fondly of
wassail than all the empties or tea-filled
bottles sitting dismally in windows.

“Findy”: My morning walk to the
office takes me through a short street
flanked by old-fashioned terrace houses
the front doors of which open straight
on to the footpath. Most of them look
dingy and shabby, but one always attracts
my attention. Curtains at the windows
are draped back to reveal tastefully-
arranged bowls of flowers, the doorstep
is always blackened and polished till it
shines, and usually as I go by the lady
of the house is diligently sweeping the
footpath in front of her door. Till now
I have looked upon her as a model
housewife, but apparently I’ve been
wrong. She’s a menace and a threat
to society. At least that’s the only con-
clusion I can draw from a newspaper re-
port of the prosecution of a man for
“having swept portion of a footpath.”
The summons was issued by the Sydney
City Council under a by-law which
prohibits persons other than council em-
ployees from sweeping footpaths between
the hours of 8.30 a.m. and 7 p.m. The
guilty party was fined ten bob.

“Ex-C.G.”: I, too, was a “live-wire
salesman in the Yarra City (B. 12/2/’47),
beginning with suburban land and-finish-
ing with vac. cleaners. But I got salary
and commission for both, the salary be-
ing just about enough to pay board (then-
about 30s. a week) and fares. A positive
army of us used to spread over the
suburbs every day. I’ve eaten lunch
in the Caulfield Gardens and similar
places with the “representatives” of as
many as 30 different firms and frequently
found myself working, in a street with
competitors ahead arid behind and on
the flanks. You have to be sturdy and
possessed of unlimited optimism to last.
I had strength and optimism in plenty,
but I gave in eventually and went spread-
ing metal on a Gippsland road —hard
and slogging toil in mud and water, but
a blessed relief after the endless
streets and the eternal door-knocking and
the constant nervous tension.

“Zake”: For the whitecollar worker
the chief disability about trouser “turn-
ups” (B. 29/1/’47) is that the friction
caused by their rubbing against the shoes
results in a double fraying, fore and
aft, with mending operations rendered
more complicated. For the manual
worker, especially if his toil is above
ground level, they can be a death-
trap. No so long ago a plumber was
working on the roof of a Rose Bay block
of flats. As he walked around the scaf-
folding the toe of one shoe caught in the
cuff of the other trouser leg and he
tripped, crashing to his death. The
prudent building worker who goes aloft
wraps his trouser-cuff around his leg and
pulls his sock over it.

“R. 8.”; New Guinea air crews will
remember the Wairopi Bridge, bombed
day after day for months to hinder Nip
troop and supply movements around
Salamaua. It was later found that the
Japs were just putting on a show of re-
pairing the bridge every day, carrying
on enough activity around it to kid the
observers, while moving most of their
stuff over another well-concealed and
unmolested crossing. My cobber George,
in hospital with one of the worst doses
of tinea I ever saw, used to enliven dhe
slow-passing hours with a highly imagin-
tive story of how he got the infection in
a “rope burn from the Wairopi Bridge,”
I was not surprised a couple of years
later to hear from him in Canada that
the old rope yarn, now streamlined and
glib from long use, was still good for
free drinks in any town in the Dominion
or the U.S.

“Tackline S.”: Lounging on Sydney
Conservatorium’s grassy slopes during

male counterparts. Naval officers borrow
clothes. One, booked to call on royalty,

necessary high footwear. Replied the

“Col M.”: “A 1 Capone Is Dying.”
Daily newspaper billboards sadly an-
nounced it, making me fear we were
about to lose a champion racehorse.
Actually the papers were referring to
the original “Public Enemy No. 1.” As
A 1 has now put down his tommy-gun for
ever, arid it is not good to speak evil of
him, I give a brief biography:
At the age of 20 Capone acquired his
title of “Scarface,” having lost a razor-
fight. He served an apprenticeship in
Chicago for three years as a “rod” or
professional killer. During Prohibition he
became his adopted nation’s most successful
bootlegger, and then the leader of a gang
who took an active interest in politics. So
, active that on St. Valentine’s Day, 1929,
his crew surprised the opposition “and
sprayed them with sub machine-guns and
sawn-off shotguns until the last of the seven
stopped twitching.” After this friends and
relatives of the seven deceased began
making passing shots at A 1 and his boys,
so a few months later Capone surrendered
to the police, claiming that he carried a
concealed revolver, and was locked up in
safety few a year. On a charge of income-
tax evasion Capone later received what
transpired to be a life sentence, spending
it at Alcatraz. There, psychologists dis-
covered the amazing fact that he was “sub-
ject to intermittent mental disturbances.”

“Ad Rem”: A disturbing feature to
emerge from this Test series is the new
significance which players attach to
applause. The century-maker once said
“thanks” with a brief touch of
the cap or a cursory wave of the
bat and then climbed back into the
block-hole to await the next ball. Now-
adays proceedings are held up while
the hero takes a brief stroll down the
pitch, doffing his lid two or three
times en route. All that is missing is
the obsequious bow. Worse still is the
new idea of players standing back at the
gateway so that some special performer
may enjoy a clap all of his own. If this
stagey degeneration goes on it won’t be
long before the “centurion” has to
make three or four dashes from the
pavilion to the field in response to so
many “curtains.”
THE FIRST ESSENTIAL.
“Wanted, assistant for doctor’s surgery, tactful on
phone.”'— “Daily” ( Mosman ).
She may be tall or tiny, plump or slender,
Buxom or willowy, brunette or blonde,
Merry and gay or serious, in the tender
First bloom of youth or p’r’aps a bit beyond;
But all that counts (except, of course, her
gender)
Is being always able to respond
With perfect tact and in a winning tone
To all communications on the phone..
Her voice, one takes it for a fundamental
Requirement to the instrument to bring,
Has to be ever low and soft and gentle
(What Shakspeare noted as “an excellent
thing
In woman”); coaxing, too, as some parental
Bird’s to her nestlings ere they take the wing.
And where can sympathetic tact be shown
So reassuringly as on the phone?
The advertiser’s known in his profession
Assistants, it’s permissible to guess,
A trifle short on courteous discretion,
A bit too prone to peremptoriness,
So now he stipulates for the possession
In whosoever’s next at his address
Of delicate discernment, to be thrown
In all she says—or doesn’t —on the phone.
She must be quick to find the most propitious
Mode to convey what’s most expedient,
And never to permit an injudicious
Word from her lips that might provoke
dissent.
To soothe the timid, humor the capricious,
Are plainly pumoses for which she’s meant,
And crowded waiting-rooms may soon depone
In part to efficacy on the phone.
To other billets women may attain on
More solid qualities, we know full well,
But here the stress is definitely lain on •
As absolutely indispensable
(That which professors call a sine qua non)
A talent guaranteed as bound to tell,
And one regarding which much less is known,
Unfailing tactfulness upon the phone.

T. THE R.


“lodge”: Familiar figures in the streets
of Tokyo are the American Army’s U.S.-
born and -reared Jap interpreters. In
appearancfe they differ from the home-
grown article only in the well-fed way
they fill, their uniforms. Visiting that
village soon after VP-Day I was amused
at the sight of one of my mates hurrying
down a footpath followed by a team of
brats chanting the usual “choc-al-eto, cig-
ar-eto, hello, 0.K.” One or two older
Japs hovered about, hopefully eyeing the
heavy coat he wore. An interpreter
arriving, the harassed Digger grabbed
him by the sleeve. “Listen, mate,” he
bellowed, “for Gawsake explain to these
apes that I’m one of those barb’rous
Australians they’ve heard about from
To jo and I’m in town on an atrocity
orgy.” It did no good. The Japs had
formed their own opinions about the
conquerors 24 hours after the first land-
ing.

“0.R.”: Waiting for my first glimpse
of “The Overlanders” the other night I
found myself sitting through scene after
scene of a “Sports Display” in Moscow's
Red Square, one of those gigantic efforts
which seem inseparable from any totali-
tarian celebration. Divorced from the
spectacular effect of mass there was a
good deal of the excellent and much of
the ordinary about the affair; but the
old couple next to me were tremendously
impressed. “Marvellous physique,” he
whispered. “All these Russians have
wonderful bodies.” She agreed. “It
comes from all the exercises they do,”
she supposed. Yet in all that display
the pick of the athletes of a fifth of the
earth’s surface, there seemed nothing that
could not have been equalled or excelled
at Bondi, let alone in the. outback. And
many glimpses were afforded of Stalin,
Molotov and other non-participants who
would have been classed C 3 or worse in
any Army analysis. Incidentally, Stalin
rated b. sporadic round of applause from

“Nagheer”; White frocks are
not regarded as desirable even-
ing wear just at present in one
West Queensland town. Some
local humorist started a yarn
about a mysterious woman in
white who haunted its streets
at night gibbering in strange
tongues and making mysterious
hypnotic signs. A hospital nurse
going out to post a late letter
encountered a young man as
she emerged from the post-
office verandah. He gave a yell,
and when she walked toward
him with the intention of help-
ing a possible nerve case, he J
screamed louder and bolted. A
hospital patient sleeping on a
verandah required a lot of
demonstration before he would
believe that the night-nurse
passing on her rounds was not
the dire apparition of which he
had been told. The star turn
was contributed by a milkman
who came up the back steps just as the
lady of the house, clothed in a long white
nightgown, opened the door to put out the
just-remembered jug. Two gallons of best
cowjuice had contributed further white-
ness to the picture before he recovered
his nerve.

“G.M.”: Recent mention of strange
cargoes carried by air freighters revives
memories of one or two unorthodox loads
lifted by Air Force pilots during the war.
The trip from an outback ’drome to the
coast in an Avro Anson to ug
oysters and crayfish for a mess “do’
was a common occurrence. Not so com-
mon was the experience of one bright
lad who bought a couple of sucking pigs
for Christmas dinner. He took personal
delivery from the farmer, stowing the
pigs in the boot of his plane. He in-
dulged in a few mild aerobatics to
announce his arrival home, but regretted
his enthusiasm when he landed and found
that sucking pigs are not immune from
air-sickness. Some time later the same
pilot was about to test a plane that had
been grounded for an overhaul. As he
stepped in’to the cockpit he heard an un-
usual noise from the rear. Investigating,
he discovered in the fuselage a mother
cat and four kittens. They might have
become famous if only they had kept
their mouths shut.

“Galenus”; Making his morning
rounds, the new m.o. Was told by the
sister in B ward that the night-nurse

keeping the patients awake with yells
and complaints about being bitten and
trampled by an imaginary horse. Would
he please speak to Paddy and quieten
him down? Assuming his best psychi-
atristic manner, he put the old fellow
through the usual questioning and wound
up by assuring him that it had been
only a nightmare, nothing to be afraid
of, asleep or awake. “Me young mahn,”
replied Paddy, “wid all reshpect to ye as

“Kaypee”: Those “potential officers”
(B. 5/2/’47). Tep of us were sent to do
a course in astro-navigation at Mount
Stromlo. On rejoining our show we were
instructed to run a similar school within
the brigade, four students to come from
each unit. It was stipulated that the
students should have a knowledge of
maths, including trigonometry, and be
able to use logarithms. On the first day
we set a few questions to test the capacity
of the students. Wandering round the
class to see how they were progressing, I
found one lad gazing at a blank piece of
paper. “What’s wrong,” I asked, “having
a bit of bother with the questions?” In
a hoarse confidential whisper came the
reply “I can’t read or write, sir,”

“2315”: “Ceg’s” yarn of the gunboat
at Gallipoli (B. 29/1/’47) recalls one of
the best examples I saw of the nerve and
discipline of the First A.I.F. On the
troopship Rangitara on the night when
the Sydney was hunting for the Emden,
the convoy was in darkness, and we were
assembled on the horsedeck in two lines
waiting to rescue the mokes if a torpedo
found us. The word had gone round
“I expect George down with his camera
any minute .”
that there was to be no talking, as the
subs with the Emden (if any) would have
amplifiers. The blackness in the bowels
of the ship was complete. There was an
open hatch just behind us. Suddenly a
terrific crash shook us from below. With-
out being told I knew the bottom had
been blown out of the tub. Not a man
moved. Not a sound came from the
double line of drivers and gunners for
at least six seconds after the crash. Then
Darky, the man next to me, whispered
softly: “What was that?” Somebody in
authority heard the whisper and said
“One of the hatches fell down the hold.’-’
And it was so. After that I knew what
to expect when the Originals got into
actioq.
“My husband simply adores ornamental shrubs."
“Passun”: I’ll always believe that
cricket saved our Haisho prison camp
from the destructive intentions of Ameri-
can bombers. Early in ’43 a Liberator
flew in on the beam of a radio-locator
nicely placed near our barracks. The
crew must have been all set to let go at
the Jap-like terrain when some intelligent
Yank —perhaps he came from Phila-
delphia—spotted us chasing leather out,
on the parade ground. He would have
counted 13 men and remembered what
a 22-yard strip of rolled cinders stood
for. At any rate the pilot came down for
a closer look at our joyful demonstration
of arm-waving, cut short by the enemy
guards’ application of dog-wallopers and
rifle butts. After that the low-flying
bombers always appeared to line up on
our camp before going further afield to
destroy more important Jap installations.

“Dekko”; What Mr. Shean told Mr.
Gallagher (Red Page 13/11/’46) about
W. E. Harney’s book North of 23 in-
terested me, in particular the account of
“the blind woman who carried about the
lame woman on her shoulders so that
between them they had both eyes and
legs.” Quite a long time ago Dumas, in
The She-wolves of Machecoul, told of a
similar partnership, A great giant of a
man, a bit wrong in the head, carried
about on his shoulders a very alert in-
telligent man who had lost his legs, so
that between them they had both brains
and legs. Believe me I was surprised that
neither Mr. Gallagher nor Mr. Shean
seemed to have read that book. I won-
der if Mr. Harney has.

“Ceg”: Not all motorists shrink to
the size of a throttle button (B. 5/2/’47)
when told by a policeman to pull into the
kerb. A car salesman friend was so
directed near 'Princes Bridge. The
John followed him, with notebook open
ready to do business. My friend recog-
nised a potential buyer and tactfully
switched the subject from his offence to
the merits of the car he was driving.
One thing led to another, and in no time
he drove off with the policeman’s signa-
ture on the dotted line for anew car and
the alleged offence wiped out. Nothing
like keeping your head and seizing every
opportunity.
“Ken”: Even the nicest of traffic cops
can be a menace at times. Johnson, pro-
ceeding carefully along the ro%l in his
spanking new sedan, was flagged to the
kerb by his good friend and lodge
brother, a constable of the Traffic
Branch, who had matters of import to
discuss —mainly the composition of the
indoor bowls team selected to play the
Hibernians the following night, a sub-
ject necessitating much theatrical fist-
pounding and finger-pointing. * While

in town shuffled past Johnson huddled
miserably over the wheel and wished fer-
vently that lodges, indoor bowls, motor-
cars and traffic cops had never been in-
vented.

“Harold Hardupp”: Australians seem
to have lost the capacity for resenting
encroachments upon their privileges. My
own first beer strike came when a beer-
less suburban publican dared to put a
penny on the price of his bottled beer —
it made the price sevenpence. Regard-
ẁ
to raise the price of
mugs from threepence
to fourpence and others
to put a charge on
counterlurich or abolish
it. When the big “three-
course - meal - for - six -
pence” restaurant lifted
its charge a penny the
crowd of usual diners
stood outside the doors
daily for three days and
demonstrated; and the
strike was won. And
when anew building
in Pitt-street blocked
what had been regarded
as a public right-of-
way from George-street
a representative of in-
dignant path-users was
found to take the mat-
ter through the courts;
to this day the owners
have to allow the use
of a passage -way
through the building to
maintain the shortcut.
The same public spirit
was responsible for the
arched laneway that
leads from Bridge-
street to Dalley-street.
But the old tinderlike
tendency to flare in the
resistance of any loss of privilege has
faded out. Today queues, unnecessary
shortages and all sorts of deprivations are
accepted with a shrug. We have grown
used to them.

“S. Post”: Evidently we are not the
only people with housing difficulties. I
read of a Los Angeles couple suing their
landlord to the tune of 30,000 dahlers for
spreading gossip about the missus carry-
ing on with other parties in the absence
of thfe husband. The plot was to
break up the marriage and get the pair
out of their flat!
* * * m
“Hacksaw”: The first plans and
specifications for the atomic future have
been brought out by the Victorian Archi-
tectural Research Group in its report on
the State’s town and country planning.
It declares that all previous town-plan-
ning projects have become completely
old-fashioned and that centralisation
must go in favor of dispersion. Mel-
bourne and Sydney will be so dispersed
that some of their suburbs will just about
meet, and jet-propulsion planes will shoot
citizens from outlying suburbs to their
business in less time than it takes to
travel from Kew to Bourke Street. There
will be no more rural and urban divisions,
as each will be merged into the other.
The Melbourne of tomorrow, however,
still exists in the imagination of the
planners. It will have elevated and sub-
terranean traffic channels and innumer-
able bridges, pedestrian traffic will be
elevated to first-floor level, helicopter
roof landings will be provided in the
heart of the city and there will be under-
ground parking areas convertible into
air-raid centres. In the meantime Mel-
bourne civic authorities have been trying
for 20 years to make up their minds
about the removal of a few simple bottle-
necks. •

“Torpabo”: P’raps I’m getting into my
dotage but I can’t understand “Curtain
Raiser’s” paragraph (B. 15/1/’47). I
presume the platform would revolve in
the opposite direction to the way the
horses were running, and in that case
the fallen horse would soon be out of
sight. Suppose the platform revolves in
the same direction. Does “C.R.” really
believe a fallen horse will keep ahead of
galloping horses? I should like to get this
straightened out. If the par is correct
there ought to be a clue to perpetual
motion in it, and I’ll begin my researches
straightway.

“Captain Cook”: Once famous as port
for the Palmer goldfields as well as for
the number of hotels in its one and
only business street, Cooktown can still
boast a Commonwealth champion who
retired undefeated. Forty years ago the
fame of Mick Fein, a heavily-whiskered
champion banana-eater, spread through-
out the States and led to many matchings
with visiting fruit gourmands. Highlight
was a £SO a-side match with the Northern
Rivers banana-demolishing crack. Mick
cantered in with a score of 12 dozen six-
inch bananas, consumed in 2\ hours of
regular swallowing. He kept two peelers
going all out, and his challenger was full
to the neck at his 56th banana. One
gulp, one banana, was the Cooktown
champ’s technique.
TEN THOUSAND MILLION YEARS
AGO.
“Sir Harold Jones, Astronomer Royal, now visiting
Australia, gives it as his opinion that it is quite
likely human life may exist on other planets, that
all matter in space came into existence about ten
thousand million years ago, and that recognition of
the truth of " this and other astronomical theories
presents no conflict between scientists and religion.”
The final point, most will agree
With me, I think, beyond a doubt
Is one for scientists and the-
ologians to argue out.
Let them decide it, if they can;
But there is evidence to show
Our good old universe began
Ten thousand million years ago.
All had thb selfsame date of birth,
Sun, planets, meteors and stars;
Venus can give no points to Earth
In age, or Capricorn to Mars.
Like husky peds they hit the breeze,
Sprang off the mark, as ’twere, arow,
From Scorpio to Aries,
Ten thousand million years ago.
Sir Harold views it as a clock,
Wound up and started on its way,
But timed to tick for what a stock
Of countless icons who can say?
Still, none may fault its staying powers,
Since first it got its status quo,
This good old universe of ours,
Ten thousand million years ago.
All planets started, he’ll concede,
Level, and all seem wearing well,
But which of them is in the lead
For living creatures none can tell.
Meanwhile it ought to give the ground
We tread fresh interest to know
That it materialised around
. Ten thousand million years ago.

THE SERVICE MAN
Britain 's Heavy Share.
“Ek Dum”: The British Government
some time ago issued a list of losses in
World Sea War 11.
Australia’s quota consisted of Sydney,
lost in action with a raider in the Indian
Ocean in November, 1941 ; Perth, sunk
in the Battle of Java in February, 1942,
and Canberra, sunk off Savo in August,
1942, To make up for Canberra the Ad-
miralty presented Shropshire to the
R.A.N.
Destroyers sunk were Waterhen and
Nestor in the Mediterranean, Voyager in
the Timor Sea and Vampire in the
Indian Ocean. Sunk also were three
minesweepers, Armidale, Geelong and
Wallaroo.
Little was heard in Australia of
Canada’s losses, and it is scarcely realised
how large a share that Dominion took
in the defence of Atlantic Sea routes, or,
for that matter, how great was her build-
ing. While Australia’s losses were
almost entirely of ships which were not
Australian-built, Canada’s small ships
“Better check that artificial horizon, Jge.”
which went down came, in the main, out
of her own yards. Canada developed a
great shipbuilding industry in the years
1*940-45, being, of course, in a special
position because of her geographical re-
lationship with the United States which
renders the United States Navy virtually
a defence of Canadian shores.
Canada had few or no cruisers to lose,
but seven of her destroyers went—Fraser,
Margaree, Ottawa, Veteran, St. Croix,
Athabascan and Skeena. To these were
added a frigate and ten corvettes, plus
four minesweepers—22 ships.
Maoriland’s toll was three small craft,
one of which was sunk in battle —
the anti-submarine ship Moa bombed to
death off Tulagi on April 7, 1943. One
of the others was sunk by a mine and
one by collision with a ferry.
The Royal Indian Navy lost a corvette
and a sloop and two auxiliary mine-
sweepers, and South Africa four small
craft lent by the R.N.
All Rfificli
Aimosi Au-Dmisn
The united white population of
Canada, Australia, South Africa and New
Zealand is round 24,000,000. Jndia has
nearly 400,000,000 inhabitants who had
to be protected. Yet until Canada laid
down two small aircraft-carriers and
three armed merchant cruisers late in the
war the only warships above destroyer
strength built m . the Dominions and en-
gaged in war duties were the old 5100-ton
Adelaide and the old four-craft aircarner
Albatross. All Australia s cruisers were
built in British yards save Adelaide ; the
two Canadians (Uganda and Ontario)
Gambia from Cammell La,rd and Swan
U . n e y* . . . u t
Australia built three destroyers in the
six years of war, and Britain gave us
nine five Quilhams and four “N” class,
Though Australians built numerous little
ships, Canadians outstripped them three
to one.
The United Kingdom, including
Northern Ireland, .has roughly 44,000,000
people, and they were mobilised for
active service in the proportion of five to
one Australia or Canada in the first three
years of the war.
The Royal Navy in 1939 had 15 indi-
vidual battleships and b.cs., each one
of which had a tonnage equal to
the whole of Australia’s “capital”
Navy. With a population six to one Aus-
tralia’s it provided 20-to-l strength in
capital ships reckoned in numbers and
more than 20-to-l strength in tonnage.
Royal Naval losses were proportion-
ately to strength heavier than in any
other war. Out of the 15 battleships ex-
tant in 1939 five were lost; out of 50
cruisers and light cruisers 31, or 62 per
• cent., went down ; of 148 destroyers 128,
or 90 per cent., were sunk. And 77 subs.
were lost-—5O per cent, more than the
country started the war with. Nearly
51,000 R.N. men, exclusive of Marines
and the Dominion Navies, were
returned killed or missing. Including
small vessels, the average monthly loss
during 71 months of World War II was
46 vessels. The air was the greatest
source of danger, with the submarine
next. Aircraft sank 11 cruisers and 50
destroyers, against nine cruisers and 36
destroyers credited to U-boats,
But the R.N. and the R.A.F. took
ample vengeance—7Bl U-boats, 85
Italian and 130 Japanese submarines went
down, th§ bulk of them as the resplt of
exclusively British activities,
Atlantic and Mediterranean
The greatest concentration of effort by
the enemy was around the British Dies,
Two-fifths of the British vessels of the
four main classes were sunk in or near
the waters surrounding those islands,
It is a phase Of the war little realised
when the efforts of the Americans are
appraised. What they did was splendid,
but it was done without the interruptions
of a persistent air fight going on over their
factories, workshops, yards, docks and
wharves, plus a battle which accounted
for one-third of the defenders’ total
cruiser losses and one-quarter of their
destroyer losses, raging round ports
through which virtually all British war
material was passing,
No other nation than the U.K. had to
fight such a battle, while (in Admiral
Cunningham’s words) “a major fleet of
enemy battleships and numerous cruisers
anc j d es t. r oyers” was contained in the
Mediterranean by way of a sideshow by
“a few cruisers, destroyers and sub-
marines” with poor air cover. It was here
'that casualties were heaviest. In the
Mediterranean Britain suffered half her
cruiser and two-fifths of her destroyer
losses.
The Nor th Atlantic was the third-
heaviest battleground and the Arctic con-
voy routes the fourth Xo k the route
o p en to Russia cost the R.N. two cruisers,
e jgfit destroyers, three corvettes, three
fi rs t-flight minesweepers, two sloops, two
f r ig a tes and one submarine.
nd P / u ‘t ra)ia> Britain was compeSd.
in 1942, amid abuse and insult, to send
two battleships to Malaya, and, later,
w fien the barrage of insult was even more
offensive, was obliged to send five battle-
shipSj a s the nucleus of a major fleet
hurriedly to the Indian Ocean to defend
the routes over which Australian troops
were lying brought homeland Australian
war material carried, and to defend the
shores of Australia, which had not built
a fight cruiser in 25 years. While the
ships were on the way Mr. Curtin re-
fused to divert an Australian division a
few hundred miles to save Rangoon,
And afterwards, of course, “Labor”

„ LONDON AND BIRMINGHAM, MAY sth-16th. 1947
This is your first opportunity in seven years to
see your old suppliers in Britain and to meet new ones.
Overseas Buyers are invited to Britain for the
1947 British Industries Fair. It will enable them to
establish personal contact with the makers of the
immense range of United Kingdom goods displayed
in the London (Lighter Industries) and Birmingham
(Hardware & Engineering) Sections of the Fair. The
careful grouping of exhibits will assist buyers to
compare the products of competing firms with a
minimum of time, trouble and expense. Special
arrangements to suit individual markets can be dis-
cussed and terms and conditions of business settled
direct with the manufacturer, since only the actual
producer or the sole selling agent may exhibit.
for full details of the 1947 Fair apply to the nearest British
Commercial Diplomatic Officer or Consular Officers or the
British Trade Commissioner in your area.
BRITAIN PRODUCES
THE GOODS
with which this‘country (“Labor” bitterly
opposing) had sent three almost un-
armed divisions to the Mediterranean.
British Building
In 1939 the U.K. had 22,000,000 tons
of mercantile shipping, excluding vessels
less than 100 tons. Of the 750 tramps
which began the battle in 1939, 571 were
sunk. Of the 1100 ships in the great liper
fleets (8,500,000 tons gross), half were
sunk. Fifty per cent, of tankers went.
Yet at the end of the war, in one way
and another, the British fleets of mer-
chant ships had been brought back to
19,600,000 tons.
The remarkable fact about the naval
situation is that bombed and besieged
little Britain ended the war with one
battleship (the Vanguard was near enough
to actual completion) more than she had
at the beginning. She built five battle-
ships, making the total 16, and 20
cruisers, bringing the total in 1945 to 57.
She set afloat six aircraft-carriers in the
23,000-30,000-ton classes, and had 53,
mostly in the 18,300-ton class, on the
way when the war ended. She built 142
destroyers and had 56 on the stocks
at the cease-fire, many of them almost
in the light-cruiser class, against the three
which this country produced (from
British plans and with much machinery
imported) in its six years of war.
It seems no wonder that a chuckle
comes from the North when little Mr.
Makin talks about our “world leader-
ship.” If we propose to be “world
leaders,” it is about time we began to
justify it by making the country navally
and militarily strong enough to stand on
its own legs by carrying a fair share of
British Commonwealth defence.
Darwin and Short Memories.
“Ek Dum”; On February 19 Aus-
tralia remembers, or should remember,
the dreadful raid on Darwin in 1942.
The day was made the occasion for a
cocktail party in Sydney—a strange func-
tion with which to hallow a calamity in
which 280 persons, largely innocent and
defenceless civilians, were killed and 300
to 400 wounded. And all in an attack by
a few enemy machines, on an exposed
town which had been left without the
simplest facilities for sheltering or de-
fence.
A better idea would be if February
19 was recognised as a Defence Prepared-
ness Day at which citizens combined
each year to consider what happens to
countries which fail to provide for their
own protection.
This year they would have to remember
that, despite the lessons of the past, the
Northern Territory is skinned of defence
and of defence manpower. “Labor,”
which was in office on February 19, 1942,
has a very short memory.
U.S.-Canada Agreement.
“Ek Dum”; Canada’s reciprocal de-
fence agreement with the United States
further emphasises what Americans are
thinking as to the future of peace and
the direction from which any breach may
come! - They strove hard for an even
closer arrangement, including the right
to establish bases on Canadian soil. But
on this point they found Canadians ada-
mant ; determined to keep their sove-
reignty.
Our Canadian cousins have a very
strong bargaining power in their re-
sources, some of them almost exclusive
to the Dominion, and in their atom-war-
fare developments, which are behind
those of the United States only in the
matter of actual manufacture. Their
arrangements are in line with the limited
arrangements between the United States
and British Governments, which are
based on the mutual realisation that no
major war could now occur without all
the Anglo-Saxon countries being in-
volved on the same side.
Benind the bare wording of some of the
clauses of the arrangement lie certainties
which are not phrased.
For instance, the agreement to en-
courage common designs and standards in
arms, equipment, organisation and train-
ing must mean that in reality there will
be common standards and exchange of in-
formation. And reciprocal availability of
military, naval and air facilities means
that Britain must be a full party to the
arrangement, since her own agreements
with Canada are affected.
It is now clear that Anglo-American
delence is more or less integrated, and
that it other countries do not like it they
can lump it.
The Americans could never allow a
country likely to be hostile to themselves
to conquer Britain, because the resources
\vhicn the conquering country would
obtain would alter the world balance of
power and give that country complete
military and naval dominance. The con-
queror would get, also, a vast aerodrome
from which American cities, particularly
vulnerable to that sort of attack, could
be bombed, even with bombers now in
operation. Also, a rocket range from
which the American continent could be
assailed. These facts are indisputable,
particularly since any invader would not
respect Eire.
Britain similarly could not stand out-
side a war in which the Americans were
involved. Canada and its indispensable
resources would be in jeopardy, as would
Australasia. Any subjugation of the
United States would inevitably be fol-
lowed by attacks on Canada and Britain
itself.
In any case, Britain would have to be
involved in an American war at an early
stage, because Canada would be involved.
The only route through which the one
Power which could attack the United
States, without first attacking Britain or
attacking other Western European
countries in such a way as to endanger
Britain, would be through Canada.
"Operation Joe."
“Ek Dum”; In the new biography of
Generalissimo Stalin it is averred that
“the successful accomplishment” of that
great soldier’s “national strategic plan in
1944” put Russia in a position, without ,
Anglo-American help, to occupy all Ger-
many apd France. This forced Mr.
Churchill to wade into the invasion of
Western Europe and wickedly forestall
the Red Army of liberation.
Given in an official biography this
must, of course, be accepted by all. And
why should it not be accepted?
The only things that stand in the way
are;
(1) That Mr. Churchill and President
Roosevelt specifically agreed on the
preparation of plans for the invasion of
Western Europe early in 1942.
(2) That these plans had advanced so
far in 1943 that they were handed over
by the joint Governments to Field-
Marshal Montgomery.
(3) That it was when assemblies and
surveys, which German spies and air-
craft could not avoid seeing, began that
Marshal Stalin’s great 1944 “strategic
plan” began to operate, seemingly much
to his own astonishment —after virtually
all arrangements for the invasion of
France were complete in Britaih.
(4) Marshal Stalin’s plan consisted
in waking up of a morning and
finding that the Germans who had in-
fested some sector of his front during
the night had disappeared into the blue.
The Marshal then let out a wild yell of
frustration and went in pursuit of the
enemy, who was engaged in retiring into
his central bases to await the Western in-
vasion. During these pursuits the Mar-
shal frequently performed the most re-
markable feats, such as slaughtering mil-
lions of Huns, who didn’t exist, before
he had caught up with them.
(5) Marshal Stalin also performed the
remarkable strategic feat of reaching
Berlin after the British and Americans
had torn the strongest part of the Ger-
man Army to pieces, including several
of the atmored divisions which Uncle
Joe claimed already to have destroyed on
their way from Russia. After Untie Joe
had wiped them out they turned up at
full strength, fighting like blazes in the
Ardennes during the Christmas offensive
in 1944-45. It was part of the strategic
success of the Generalissimo that the
Western Allies were compelled to re-
strain their own troops from taking Ber-
lin; On this the Generalissimo had in-
sisted, and his allies apparently believed
that if they did not give him everything
except the kitchen sink he might make
a separate peace.
This fear, engendered in 1941, haunted
them throughout their dealings with the
Marshal, and was the secret* of his
strength in bargaining.

PERSONAL ITEMS
Last week the cables brought a
simple announcement that Acting-Group-
Captain Edwards had been awarded the
0.8. E. in recognition of distinguished ser-
vices during the final stages of opera-
tions in South-East Asia. Even before
gaining that honor Hughie Edwards was
the most decorated Australian airman.
His V.C. came to him for a daring hedge-
hopping raid on Bremen in 1941 a few
months after he had collected his D.F.C.
for a masthead attack on an enemy
vessel off the coast of Holland. A year
later he led a formation of Mosquitos
in a raid on Eindhoven and was awarded
“the D.S.O. for a “faultlessly-executed
operation.” Edwards was transferred to
S.E.A.C. towards the end of the war,
but his late arrival in that sphere of opera-'
tions did not prevent him from adding
another decoration to his collection.
Westralian-born, he’s 32.
Among Maoriland’s recipients of New
Year honors was James Hight, for 12
years Rector of Canterbury University
College, from which he retired in 1940.
Born at Halswell, Canterbury, in 1870,
he has identified himself with his native
province all his life. He graduated B.A.
in 1893 and M.A. the following year, and
his long association with Canterbury Uni-
versity College began when he was
appointed lecturer in constitutional
history and political economy in 1901.
Hight was the first to receive from the
University of New Zealand the degree of
Doctor of Literature. He was made a
fellow of the Royal Economic Society in
1904.
Oliver Adams has returned after 20-odd
years abroad. Tall, slim and sunburnt,
this Tasmanian-born wanderer is remark-
ably straight-backed and clear-eyed for
all his 77 years. A native of Launceston,
he took up surveying as a'profession, and
was engaged for over 30 years in land
surveys and railway constructional work.
As a young man he found himself at
Zeehan at the time of the silver-mining
boom, and added mining engineering to
his vocations. In 1924 he left for Spain
to help survey the route of the Santander-
Calatayna railway and stayed there for
two years. The next 20 years he spent
in Argentina on general railway work
and mining for rafaelita or glance pitch.
An occasional Bulletin contributor, a
paragraph he wrote advocating the in-
troduction of the tinamou, a South
American bird, into this country created
a great deal of interest among Australian
ornithologists. His son, Noel, was press
secretary to the Duke of Gloucester, and
is now on the editorial staff of the
Adelaide “Advertiser.”
Archibald Lewis Blythe, whose name is
synonymous with Red Cross in N.S.W.,
was born in Napier, M.L., about 62 years
before Prior pinned him down with a
pencil in Sydney last week. In the years
before the First World War he was on
the land in Queensland, and his first con-
tact with the Red Cross came with the
Australia Day appeal in 1915. That ap-
RED CROSS.
peal brought in £827,000, about half of
which was set asifre for sick and wounded
soldiers—no Repat. then. After the
armistice Blythe became chairman of all
Red Cross industries and N.S.W, rep-
resentative on the National Council.
When Hitler’s war broke out he was
appointed director of Red Cross appeals,
and it was he who originated the scheme
under which suburban streets “adopted”
prisoners-of-war; a brainwave that
brought in £1,750,000. Today Blythe is
chairman of the N.S.W. branch and vice-
chairman of the Australian Red Cross.
Robert William Haines Moline, Arch-
bishop-elect of Perth, is no stranger to
Australians. A Cambridge man, he
served throughout the first World War,
winning the M.C., and gained his M.A.
degree before being ordained in 1920.
While curate at St. Mathew’s, Bethnal
Green, he was” invited by the Bishop of
North Queensland to come to Australia
as a member of the Community of St.
Barnabas’—he was its warden from 1925
to 1928. After three years as Archdeacon
of North Queensland and Sub-dean of
St. James’ Cathedral, Townsville, he re-
turned to England and is, now rector of
St. Paul’s, Knightsbridge.
“C. 8.”: If, as Director-General of
Unesco, Professor Julian Huxley visits
Australia shortly, he won’t be the first
member of his famous family to make
the trip. When his grandfather, Thomas,
was assistant-surgeon on H.M.S. Rattle-
snake, making the observations of the
surface life of tropical seas which were
embodied in his celebrated paper, “On
the Anatomy and Affinities of the Family
of the Medusae,” his ship called in at
Sydney. There he fell in love with Mrs.
Huxley, a Sydney girl whom the doctors
had given six months to live —she was
suffering from t.b. Thomas died at 70,
the greatest exponent of Darwin’s theory
of evolution and a thorn in the side of
bishops. The girl who was under a
sentence of death survived her husband
for 20 years.
Pianist John Simons, a Melbourne Con-
servatbrium product, left for London
about 13 years ago to continue his studies.
Later he was appointed organist in Wales,
to be followed in that post by another
Australian, Nancy Weir. Returning to
London, he broadcast through 8.8. C.
to Australia and gave several recitals.
At the outbreak of war he joined the
British Army and served with an ack-ack
regiment in the Thames Estuary, later
gaining his commission. During this time
his only opportunities for playing were
at camp concerts. After the surrender
he settled down to hard work and has
lately given his first post-war recital at
the Wigmore Hall, the programme in-
cluding works by Bach, Faure, Debussy,
Ravel and Prokofiev.
Appointed a K.C, on the recommen-
dation of Edmund Herring, C.J., R. R.
Shell is one of the brilliant younger
members of the Victorian Bar. Educated
at Melbourne Grammar he was 1924
Rhodes Scholar, did two years at Oxford
and became a Fellow of Brasenose Col-
lege in 1927. Called to the Middle
Temple Bar, he was admitted to the Vic-
torian Bar in 1929, Equity, constitutional
and common law are his specialties, but
he has appeared in almost every form
of jurisdiction. He has been counsel
for employers in the 40-hour week mara-
thon.
Lt.-Col, Ernest Albert Russell, who
succeeds Major S. R. Burston as Com-
missioner for S.A. of St. John’s Am-
bulance, is honorary life member and as
district officer organised the cadets of the
Brigade in 1935. A product of Adelaide
Uni., he sailed with the First A.1.F.,
served with the Sixth Field Ambulance
in Egypt and later commanded the Third
A.G.H. in France. In 1945 he became
S.A. president of the B.M.A.
Communications Superintendent for
A.N.A., H. J. Brown, educated at Fort-
street and the Sydney Uni., must be one of
the most certificated men in Australia.
He is Bachelor of Science with honors in
mathematics; of Engineering with first-
class honors and university medal for
electrical engineering; Master of Engineer-
ing with first-class honors and university
medal, and Associate of the Institute of
Engineers. He spent three years with
A.W.A. in the research and development
laboratory and was later with the Tas-
manian Hydro-Electric Commission.
When Hitler ran amuck Brown became
principal research officer in the radio
physics laboratory of the C.5.1.R., special-
ising in radar work. In 1943 he was in
U.S.A. studying radar development for
the C.5.1.R., and as the war ended he
joined A.N.A. In 1945 he represented
the department at the
Empire Conference in London on
radio aids for civil aviation. He has
supervised the installation of the A.N.A.
nation-wide teleprinter service and also
the central reservation control.
Just passed his 90th milestone at
Healesville, .Victoria, Thomas Pockett,
0.8. E., who got his decoration from the
hands of the Duke of Gloucester for his
pioneering efforts in Australian horticul-
ture. As a chrysanthemum man his name
is known throughout the world. Pockett
left England for Australia 71 years ago,
and for 30 years was curator of Mal-
vern (Vic.) Gardens. He has been 30
years in retirement at Healesville, but is
still as passionately' interested in his sub-
ject as ever. Two sons continue to raise
gigantic blooms which win prizes
throughout Australia. 1
The fact that Joseph Post, conductor
of the Melbourne A.B.C, Symphony
Orchestra, has been appointed musical
director to the Department of Infor-
mation doesn’t mean that Mr. Calwell
is to be taught to siirg. The dapper
conductor will be responsible for the
musical backgrounds .to all D. 0.1. docu-
mentary films. One now on the slips, deal-
ing with railway-gauge non-unification,

toiled and sweated for the greater part of
five A.I.F. years as C.O. of a dustblojvn,
beer-starved staging camp in the wilder-
ness, where gauge met gauge, his
job to transfer MacArthur, Blarney and
co.’s urgently-needed war equipment from
one track to another. The music for
this film should just about rock the
censor. Born and educated in Sydney,
Post was a frontline orchestrian at 15,
professor of the piano and oboe at
Sydney Con. at 18. In 1934 he spent a
year travelling England and Europe and,
before joining up early in 1940, had
toured America as celebrity conductor.
Doing much of the work Heinze left
behind him, he regards his colleague,
whom he facially resembles, as in world
class afid will be surprised if he doesn’t
receive offers to stay in Canada or U.S.
Back in Sydney on one of the periodi-
cal calls he has made since he established
himself in London about 15 years ago,
Fred R. Burley, governing-director of
the. corset firm he founded in 1912, finds
the same problems of material shortages
and uncertainty of supply that confront
business in Britain, Born at Hamilton
(Vic.), Burley started out in the soft-
goods line, but later, with his brother,
launched the figure-control concern that
has made their name a household word.
When an A.B.C. announcer spoke re-
cently of a memorial to the “late” John
Flynn one of the most surprised
listeners was Flynn of the Inland him-
self, still very much alive, as the accom-
panying sketch by Auld testifies. The
A.I.M.
matter of a suitable memorial to his
work in the establishment of the Flying
Doctor service was first discussed by the
Federal Council of Flying Doctors in
1944; present intention is to erect it at
the junction of the Mt. Isa road and the
North-South Highway. Dr. Flynn will
be 65 this year. He was born at Molia-
gul, Victoria, and after a few years with
the Victorian Education Department and
the Home Mission staff of the Presby-
terian Church he was ordained in Adel-
aide in 1911. Most of his time since then
has been spent in the outback on the
work of the Australian Inland Mission.
“Colbun”; Brisbane had a hearty wel-
come for Queensland-born Air Vice-
Marshal Don Bennett when he called in
to see his family on his way back from
New Zealand to England, piloting the
Avro York Star Glitter. In his usual
fashion he had put up some new records,
including London to Wellington in 87
hours, only 59 of them actual flying-time,
and fastest recorded crossing (J\ hours)
from Wellington to Brisbane, On arrival
he scored a third —the first overseas pilot
to arrive at Eagle Farm tarmac in a pin-
striped grey suit and a black Homburg
hat. Coming in across Moreton Bay he
showed his crew the scene of yet another,
scored 21 years ago by himself, then 15,
and a brother. They paddled a canoe
from Southport to Toowong Reach in
the Brisbane River, a matter of 60-odd
miles in four days—nine hours longer
than the whole London-Wellington voy-
age had taken.
Into the silence:
, In Sydney, at 63, William Rupert McGourt,
Clerk of the N.S.W. Assembly. He joined the
Assembly staff in 1901 and became Clerk or
the House in 1931, with a period of war ser-
vice in between. His father was M.LA. f° r
30 years, and was Speaker from 1900 to 1910.
In Sydney, at 80, William Arnott, chairman
of directors of the biscuit firm. A son of the
founder, he was closely associated with the
Y.M.C.A. and the Methodist Church.

the Lands Department. He served as Land
Commissioner in the Hughenden, Charleville
and Rorfta districts, and for the past four years
was in private practice as land valuer at
Charleville.

and stayed with it for more than 50 years.
He was an active member of the Field Natural-
ists’ Society. IT
At Palmerston North (MX.), at 68, Harry

From Melbourne
Next month a new shop in Collins-
street will start the first commercial ven-
ture of the War Widows’ Craft Guild.
Mrs. G. A. Vasey, president of the guild,
said the development of room-and house-
decoration was one new object. Beauti-
ful samples of fine craft work, done by
the members, will be on sale. The
Government has sent to Mrs.
Vasey new and beautiful weaving designs.
One in double-weaving is executed in
dull artificial silks, the colors used being
deep red, turquoise, navy and beige. It
is suitable for curtains, hangings and
chair covers. A new development by
the members .is embroidery weaving.
Nursery panels for stools are embroidered
in woven designs such as a coach and
horses, and feeders have quaint animals
woven into the material. The members
are also busy with linen weaves. Mrs.
Vasey is confident that the public will
give solid support to the products of the
skill of war widows.
White, in some cases plain, in others
gold - embroidered or given the right
note by a gleaming jewel, took the
honors in the audience’s frocktng at the
opening of “Follow the Girls” at His
Majesty’s. Grace Silk’s jacket suit of
white crepe was adorned with two gold
and diamond clips fastened in the low
neckline of her gown. The only note of
color was the large emerald-green chiffon
handkerchief she carried. Her daughter
Judith was in white organza with cherry-
red ribbons threaded' through the off-the-
shoulder neckline and through the waist-
line. Mrs. V. Cornaga and Mrs. Paddy
Ramsay, who were both in white, are
temporary “fishing widows” —their hus-
bands are at present trying to lure game
fish from Maoriland waters, Margaret
Cochrane’s gown of white tulle over
taffeta had a neckband of white ribbon
velvet sewn with emerald and ruby
stones. She was with Clyde Govett, who
chose a gown of misty grey chiffon.
Gertrude Cottrell also chose a white
gown, which featured gold embroidery.
Veronica Syme and Veronica Linehan, in
old-world frocks of white taffeta, were
with Elizabeth Cahill, in a dainty frock
of pastel-toned floral chiffon. Col.
Wright, Consul for the Netherlands,
came with his wife, who wore black
trimmed with silver. Their daughter,
Mrs. Ronald Marriott, wore pink crepe
highlighted with cyclamen sequins.
National Theatre' president Robert
Knox and his lady—she with a lovely
corsage of tiger-lilies pinned on her navy
sheer coat —were host and hostess at
sherry party given in the theatre foyer.
Gertrude Johnson, who directs the
National Theatre, was also on the receiv-
ing line, and her black-beaded cocktail
frock was worn with a chic black silk
straw hat, which had red roses and gold
leaves set in the soft crown. Beatrice
Oakley, who has just finished a successful
season of “Hansel and Gretel,” wore a
softly-draped midnight-blue crepe frock
which contrasted with a cyclamen halo
hat and gloves. Charles Norman, just
back from England, dropped in with his
wife, Pat, who is appearing in the current
show at the Little Theatre.
Wee Georgie Wood, back again in
Australia after many years’ absence, de-
lighted Tivoli first-nighters with his par-
ticular brand of humor. “Hi Ho Picca-
dilly,” which has little of hi-ho in it and
less of Piccadilly, is a well-dressed show
with the ballet excelling itself. When it
was over many friends flocked to Wee
Geergie’s dressing-room and found him
thrilled at the warm welcome he had
received and also full of concern for his
fellow-countrymen suffering from the
Great Freeze. That day he had received
word that the block of flats in which he
lives at Hampstead had flooded when the
water pipes burst. Mrs. G. Sheffield and
her daughter Molly, Alice Wyatt, Sophie
Graves and her husband and Will
Mahoney and his wife Evie Hayes were
among the greeters. Dr. and Mrs. W.
McDermott, the Norman Sprys and Roy
and Hazel Hondyman were among those
who enjoyed the night.'
Kenneth Rowell, member of a well-
known family of artists, expresses his
talent in stage decor. The exhibition of
his works was opened by Laurel Martyn,
one of the prime movers in the Mel-
bourne Ballet Club. Laurel, who talks
as well as she dances, has a flair for
color-grouping in stage costumes. She
introduced a subtle color arrangement in
her own dressing on the opening day. A
beech-toned lace jacket topped a crepe
skirt in the same muted shade ; at the
centre of the bodice was a chou of ribbon
in beech and sage-green tonings. The
same colors trimmed her small platter
hat. Young dancers at the exhibition in-
cluded Grace McLean, a picture in black
and white with cream lace yoke highlight-
ing her black frock and lace ruffles
adorning the sleeves. With her were
Gome Lodders and Max Collis, both
budding dancers. A trio in white who
attracted attention were Mesdames
Massey Burnside, Everard Baillieu
and Aldred Aldous. Patricia Bun-
bury’s black full-skirted frock was
trimmed with gold buttons, a gold
belt outlining the slim waistline. Her hat
of gold straw was large and flat.
Mrs. Olive Thring chose a cool navy-blue
and white jacket suit and a flower-
trimmed natural straw hat. Mrs. Phillipe
Perrottet was in black, with a natural
straw hat trimmed with cyclamen flowers.
Mrs. Jdhn Masters wore a vivid black-
and-white-striped jacket with her black
skirt. Thelma Prentiss looked striking in
Dutch sabots of white, with wide strap-
pings on tanned legs, worn with a white
dress and a bonnet-shaped hat.
An interested spectator at the film
“The Seventh Veil” was Leah Horo-
witz, the subject of this week’s
picture by Broothorn. Her interest
was enhanced by the fact that her mother,
the former Rosa Spriggs, who was a
pupil of Edward Goll, taught Eileen
Joyce, who of course “ghosts” for Ann
Todd. Leah, who has been here on a visit
from her home in Brisbane, is a member
of a talented musical family. Her twin
sister Sopia is a ’cellist, while her elder
sister is a pianist and assists her mother in
leaching. Leah has been heard in the
A.B.C.’s Young Australia sessions. With
unbounded energy and a determination to
make a name as a pianist, Leah will
shortly give a recital in Brisbane.
St. John’s, Toorak, was the venue for
the wedding of Nancy Wilkinson, only
daughter of Mr. and Mrs. Reginald Wil-
kinson, of Caulfield, to Flt.-Lt. Gordon
Waller, R.A.A.F., only son of Mr. Leslie
Waller, of Braidsted, Kent, England.
Nancy, who was given away by her
father, wore an ivory cloque gown, a
heart-shaped neckline and long sleeves
featuring the tight-fitting bodice; the
skirt ended in a graceful train. She car-
ried a bouquet of water lilies, and the
billowing tulle veil was caught to her
hair by orange blossoms. Helen Bissell
and Jacqueline Osborn were bridesmaids,
and they carried sheafs of delphiniums
and wore long white frocks; blue del-
phiniums were pinned in their hair.
Robert Lewis was best man and Peter
Watkins groomsman. The reception was
held at Thurlstone, St. Kilda-road, Mrs.
Wilkinson receiving the guests wearing a
beaded cinnamon brown jacket suit and
a matching hat trimmed with green plum-
age and swathed in brown veiling. Nancy
will ultimately make her home in Eng-
land. Gordon will leave shortly for Japan
to take up duties with 8.C.0.F.
From Sydney
It looks as if the Australian Fashion
Designers’ Guild and Cinesound between
them started something really pleasing to
woman’s heart last week. On designs
created by a group of this country’s dress
experts (the aforesaid guild) Cinesound
has made a rather breath-taking film. It
is a forecast of 1947 winter fashions.
There are eight slim and elegant Aus-
tralian girls showing the garments, which
start from lingerie and go on upwards to
sports wear, day dresses and evening
frocks, topped off by luxury furs. Our
old friend lambskin (now known as
mouton) comes into the picture plasti-
cised, rainproofed and so up-townish and
all that the creature’s parents in the old
home pastures wouldn’t know it.
The film was made on the hottest days
of last week when even to look at a fur
tippet would cause the spine to ooze,
but Betty Dawes heroically posed in the
£l2OO mink coat there’s been much talk
about. Give not only the coat but the
girl a hand when the two appear on the
newsreels—she deserves it. In fact, all
the girls taking part in the display de-
serve applause; they are attractive and
do the job well. There is one young and
gladsome sheer white wool frock for a
debutante. It has trails of violets painted
on the shoulder straps and around the
hem of the bouffant skirt. “If winter
comes, then spring’s not far behind” will
be the motto of the Australian Fashion
Designers’ Guild. For in the spring they
will have the goods ready for another film
of beach and summer wear. The films
will be shown throughout the world.
Fifty leading Australian manufacturers
and designers were responsible for the
display, which was organised by T, E.
Colebrook.
Thi§ smiling lady is Mrs. Robert
Butler, wife of the U.S. Ambassador in
Australia. Canberra must sometimes
seem a long way from her home in
St. Paul, Minnesota, to Mrs. Butler, who
has only one of her children, her youngest
daughter Katherine, with her in her A.C.T.
home. However, with the noted warmth
and manner of the American woman,
Mrs. Butler has already made many
friends in Sydney and in Canberra.
Light and tuneful as the tinkle of
Venetian glass, “Gay Rosalinda” waltzed
lightly into the Theatre Royal last Satur-
day to the music of Johann Strauss. The
first thing that was evident was what a
debt was owing to Leontine Sagan ; the
cunning hand, of this producer had tossed
the bright bubble into the air, and there
it floats, iridescent with nonsense and
enchanted airs. Norman Lee, who takes
over from Leontine (just arrived in Lon-
don in time to send a cable of good
wishes), can take a bow, too, for Satur-
day’s opening.
Tara Barry was a blithe and mischief-
loving Rosalinda who tossed off her
corset and an underskirt or two with a
gesture at once debonair and delicate.
And how superb her figure looks in the
black velvet evening frock and the cas-
cade of diamonds! Young men about
town will all rush out to order evening
capes after seeing the dashing Max
Oldaker twirl his around him. Two
charmers are Muriel Howard and Eliza-
beth Gaye. Richard Tauber sent first-
night good wishes to Tara Barry, who
had been the Rosalinda of his London
production. Ballet experts Mrs. Judith
Espinosa, Frances Scully, Kathleen Dane-
tree were first-nighters ; the John Fullards
were there; noted, too, the H. J. Bradys,
Mrs. E, Wunderlich and Mrs. Farley.
Practically with the whole of Bowral
looking on, and many guests mur-
muring approval from the reserved pews
of St. Jude’s Church, attractive Carma
Nathan became Mrs. Jack Minnett last
Saturday evening. Carma is the only
daughter of the Venour Nathans, of
Haling Cottage, Burradoo, and her
family is one of the most popular in the
Bowral district.
Carma wore white. It was georgette,
soft and flowing. Her veil was tulle, her
posy formed of gardenias, and she wore
no jewellery. Jacqueline Crookston and
Annette Stogdale ’maided. They were a
rhapsody..m pale gold. It was a pretty
even the rain did not spoil
it. Mrs. Venour Nathan’s lilac frock was
softly pleated. Bridegroom is the son of
the late L. A. Minnett and of Mrs.
Minnett, of Collaroy. Mrs. Minnett was
one of the many wedding guests who
week-ended at Bowral.
The Kindergarten Younger Group,
formed last week in Rosemont, the home
of president Charles Lloyd Jones, lost
no time in drawing up a campaign.
Beauty expert Helena Rubinstein, through
her Australian, representative, Mrs. Vadas,
has offered the group six original
French models (by Pierre Balmain) to be
used in a dress parade in conjunction
with Helena’s, new make-up “Command
Performance.” This will be a certain
money-spinner for the kindergartens.
The group received another offer that
filled them with delight: it is the use of
the ballroom in Mrs. C. P. Johnson’s
Woollahra home for monthly dances.
President of the newly-formed group is
Mrs. W, Kendall, the secretary is Jill
Younger and the treasurer is Annette
Fielding Jones.
Tara Barry, who has since presented
herself to Sydney audiences as the Gay
Rosalinda, played leading lady at an
afternoon party last Wednesday. Max
Oldaker was leading man, as he is
in “Rosalinda.” The two were good-
looking and upstanding and J.C.W. im-
portants, who gave the reception, twinkled
thanks at their lucky stars. The Kent
room of the Australia was oozing with
press and theatre well-knowns. There
were drinks of every variety, hard and
soft, except tea. Everybody admired
Tara’s soft felt hat, which swept up from
her lovely forehead, and Max Oldaker’s
moustache, which he has grown for his
part in “Rosalinda,” just to be inde-
pendent.
Norman Lee, who has taken over the
production of “Rosalinda” and the fol-
lowing “The Dancing Years” from
Leontine Sagan, who had to hurry
back to London and a sick hus-
band, was busy meeting old friends.
The statuesque Mrs. Harry White
wore an afternoon-party frock of flowered
taffeta. The nice Ernest Lashmars,
J.C.W.’s Harald Bowden and his wife,
and the Firm’s publicity man Mr. Wahl-
quist and Mrs. Wahlquist, Sheila Help-
mann, so soon to seek England and
her famous brother Robert, Mayne
Lynton and Mrs. Claude Flemming
were among the many who were
blithe if not cool. There was, too, just-
beginning actress Betty Gaye, very young
and slim and rather suggestive of lily-of-
the-valley.
Mrs. Mary Irvine, secretary of
the Pacific Islands Society, did the
modern equivalent of sending up
hurried smoke signals or beating the big
conch-shell last week. She got to the
telephone and sent out calls to the mem-
bers to celebrate at a tea-party in honor
of Sir Alexander Grantham, Governor
of Fiji, and his wife. There wdre no pro-
longed speeches, just welcome »by the
president, and graceful words of thanks
from Sir Alexander. No doubt Sir Alex.,
who had been one of the conferrers at
the South Seas Commission conference in
Canberra, had had his fill of long
cadenzas of the vox hurnana. Anyway,
he made quite a hit with the members,
talking in matey fashion to Ellice
Islanders, Solomon Islanders, former
dwellers in New Guinea and other coral
strands of the Pacific.
Lady Grantham did not come till late,
owing to shopping and other appoint-
ments which simply couldn’t wait, as the
two were off by plane the next morning.
Macquarie House was the landing stage
for the canoes, and over 50 members
were on time for the vice-regal hand-
shake. Mrs. Mary Irvine presented tiger-
lilies to J_ady Grantham, \sho wore a
tiny flower hat with her flowered-silk
frock.
The Archbishop of Brisbane, Dr. R. C.
Halse, 1 Archdeacon Lampard and the
Reverend H. N. Powys, Rector of St.
Michael’s, Vaucluse, between
welded the vows that bound Wendy Yates
and David Platt Pagan in holy matri-
mony last week. The wedding was in the
pretty little church of St. Michael’s, and
Wendy and her two ’maids, Sue Other Gee
and Betty Goodwin, wore all the tra-
ditional finery. Both ’maids and bride
had served in the A.A.M.W.S. in New
Guinea. The ’groom served in the
A.I.F. His parents are the David Pagans
of Hay and Vaucluse. The bride’s
parents, the Harold Yateses, held recep-
tion in the Australia after the ceremony.
Cyril Ritchard and Madge Elliott
went off in the Wangaratta—fellow-
passengers of the great Bernborough.
Madge will holiday in New York, but
Cyril jumps right into a part in Con-
greve’s “Love for Love,” a John Gielgud
production. After that the two travel on
to London and a big music show. After
that a return to Australia is among things
hoped for. ,

of many
When you - take the serious step of appointing someone to
act as manager, executor or trustee of your estate you are
entitled to be fully satisfied as to capacity to do what is
required.
The future of- others who mean much to you depends upon
your choice.
The Union Trustee Company of Australia meets all require-
ments. For sixty years it has rendered service precisely
similar to what you require.
It has built up a fund of knowledge and experience which,
through trained executives, is readily available to you.
Its directors are men of substance and standing, themselves
well accustomed to the discharge of very responsible duties.
Their accumulated experience is also at your disposal.
Estates worth in the aggregate many millions of pounds

The spring in earnings, the lift in the
div. and recent British-Australian tax
adjustments carried the price of this
Anglo-Australian co.’s £5 shares paid to
£3 from the old official ceiling of £5 3s.
6d. at end of 1946 to £8 2s. in the free
market on January 24. Later the figure
eased to £7 17s. 6d. It is necessary to
remember that the declared rate of div.,
which was lifted from 6 p.c. to 9.16 p.c.,
is now subject to English income tax at
the rate of 9s. in the £, which reduces
the actual return to shareholders to 5.04
p.c. sterling, worth 6.3 p.c. in Australian
currency at the current rate of exchange.
On that basis the immediate return to
the Australian investor at £7 17s. 6d. is
2.4 p.c. At the same price, and with
exchange and English income tax as they
are, the investor who looks for 3.5 p.c.
on his 'money counts on the nominal rate
of div. going to 13.2 p.c. sterling. And,
under the recent agreement with Britain
on double taxation, Australian share-
holders will be entitled to deduct the
British tax from the Australian tax pay-
able on the div.
Gross earnings were £144,585 stronger
at £1,398,684. Including debenture in-
terest (£53,691) and taxation (£394,301,
up £12,226), exes. (£1,218,368) took
£114,678 of the gain. After deducting
the dividend tax and £25,000 (up £15,000)
sent to the staff fund, the net amount
available to shareholders (£155,326, up
£14,907) was 5.1 p.c. on the £3,000,000
of capital, or 3 p.c. on shareholders’ funds
—capital and reserves combined. It is
a meagre return considering the wide
range of services rendered and the risks
incurred.
Disappearance of the currency reserve
of £1,585,000 has no practical signifi-
cance, apart from the possibility of inner
reserves being strengthened. It is related
to the method of presenting balance-
sheet figures, which are now shown in
sterling, whereas they formerly appeared
partly in sterling and partly in Australian
currency.
On the day the books closed (July 1,
1946) ,the co. redeemed its old 4 p.c.
stock (£924,443) and 3 p.c. stock
(£749,816) at a premium of 5 p.c. and
2 p.c. respectively. The premiums (to-
gether £61,000-odd) were charged against
inner reserves. This stock, a relic of the
financial hurricane of the was
costing the co. an average ‘of 3.5 p.c. p.a.,
which means that it was not quite earning
its keep under existing conditions. And
since, cheap money is now a feature of
Government policy, the old stock, which
was once very helpful to shareholders,
looked like becoming increasingly more
of a drag than a help in the years ahead.
Despite the redemption of stock the
co.’s liquid position remains exceptionally
strong;

* Figures prior to 1945 not fully comparable as
Australian assets and liabilities were taken into
account at par rates of exchange, not actual rates.
When the books closed liquids (up
£3,501,681) were 77.7 p.c. of liabilities to
the public, compared with 83.7 p.c. at the
previous balance and 38.2 p.c. in 1939.
Liquids include £23,902,788 (up
£2,851,792) frozen on special account with
the Commonwealth Bank. Add to this
statutory deposit the holdings of Aus-
tralian Treasury bills «(£398,406) and
Commonwealth Government securities
(£13,007,104), and it will be seem that the
co. was extending nearly twice the help
to the Government that it was to trade
and industry. The continued growth of
deposits (up £9,159,419) chiefly reflects
the effects of credit expansion associated
with war finance. What needs to be re-
membered is that rising bank deposits do
not indicate increasing real wealth unless
they are accompanied by a corresponding
creation of real assets arising out of ex-
panded production.
The most encouraging feature was the
growth of £3,990,765 in advances. But
they were still only 30.9 p.c. of deposits,
etc., as against 87.3 p.c. in 1939. Further
improvement in this ratio should mean
increased earnings. The operations of
the banks, however, are now subject to
a wide range of restrictions and controls,
and future earnings will be related to the
method of operation of these controls.
The cut in overdraft rates from 4J p.c.
to 41 p.c. as from the beginning of 1947
will partly offset the benefit of any im-
mediate growth in advances. Appear-
ances are that the bulk of bank profits
today comes from the investment basket
rather than from advances.

The accounts of this 39-year-old Sydney-
controlled fire, marine and accident
office present a sound and attractive
financial picture to both investors and
policyholders. The co., whose business
is confined to the Commonwealth, has a
paid capital of £70,000 in £1 shares paid
to 7s. each, supported and assisted by
£141,205 of reserves. The two combined,
therefore, need turn in only 3.3 p.c. to
cover 10 p.c. on capital alone, at which
rate the div. has been steady for the last
decade. The net return from investments
last term (£7809, after deducting taxation)
covered the div. with £BO9 to spare.
So, after sending £lOOO to the staff
fund, practically the whole of the under-
writing surplus was available to swell in-
vestments and the returns therefrom.
Moreover, premium income has be-
come expansive again. It showed no
marked fluctuation during the war years,
when the shrinkage in motor-vehicle and
local marine business—the latter became
a Government monopoly, relinquished in
August, 1945 —was largely offset by am-
increased volume of fire and workers’
compensation risks.
Last term the co. gathered an addi-
tional £23,757 of gross premiums
(£155,537), but an extra £10,106 was re-
insured (£42,128), leaving net premium
income £13,651 stronger, as the follow-
ing table shows;

The experience in connection with motor-
vehicle cover was unfavorable, owing to
growth in accidents following the in-
creased number of vehicles on the road;
and a lift in premium rates (which are
still below pre-war levels) on private cars
was granted by the prices commissidner.
Fire claims were heavier, too, and the
loss rate stepped up £3 4s. p.c.; it was
the heaviest for the last 15 years. The
pleasing feature is that the larger business
was written at £3 2s. p.c. less cost, leav-
ing a shrinkage of only £778 in the
underwriting surplus (£9432). The net
return from all sources (£17,241, down
£315) was thus 24.6 p.c. on capital as
against 25.1, 21.2, 22.8, 16.8, 21.9, 20.5
and 20.3 p.c. back to 1939.
The protection for policyholders and
shareholders is in this form:

Since the outbreak of war £115,600, of
which £25,500 was in respect of last
term, has been added to Government
securities. These now account for 66.9
p.c. of total assets, and are worth more
than their book value.
After being jammed at the old official
ceiling of 20s. 9d., the price of the scrip
has advanced to 245. in the free market.
At the higher figure the return is 2.9 p.c.
on a IQ p.c. div. basis, or 3.5 p.c. should
the distribution advance to 12 p.c. The

Formed in 1928 this co. took over Tas-
manian Cement Pty.’s business and a
large shale deposit at Latrobe (Tas.). It
ran into trouble early in the piece in a
commendable effort to develop the shale-
oil business. To wipe out the loss on
sale of the shale deposit and tidy up the
accounts generally 6s, Bd. was lopped
off each pound ord. share in 1934. At
the same time the pref. div. was lowered
from 8 p.c. to 7 p.c. The cement side of
the undertaking made steady progress
from the start, and by 1938 the board
considered the position good enough to
restore the £85,263 lopped off capital
four years earlier by a one-for-two bonus
issue. That lifted paid capital to its
present figure, £398,926 in 143,092 £1
7 p.c. prefs. and 383,751 ords. of 13s.
4d. each.
Before the war the co. enjoyed a virtual
monopoly of the cement trade in its home
State, and had won markets in Vic. and
further afield in the more keenly com-
petitive trade in N. S. Wales and else-
where. The proximity of good shale,
limestone and clay deposits, and cheap
Government hydro-electric power, com-
bined to make this competition possible
and profitable. Shipping difficulties cut
off the co.’s trade with the mainland
during the war, and the almost complete
stoppage of building and construction re-
duced local demand to a trickle. At the
same time manufacturing costs were
bumped up, owing to reduced out-
put, wage lifts and the rise in
the price of materials. Hence the col-
" lapse of profits, which fell from £66,601
in 1939 to £12,794 in 1943. The improve-
ment in the 1945 figure was due mainly
to shipments to India for defence pur-
poses.
Last term the shipping problem con-
tinued to hinder mainland sales. Still,
gross earnings (£66,012) stepped up
£24,254, and the net result benefited by
£5423 of the gain, thanks to a substan-
tial increase in Tasmanian demand. The
£26,126 of profit was written after allow-
ing something for taxation, an extra
£5OOO for depreciation (£12,500), for a
new charge of £2OOO in establishing a
staff fund, and includes £522 dropped
from somewhere into the marine in-
surance reserve. The £26,126 covered
the pref, div. and 6.3 p.c. on ord. capital,
compared with 22.1 p.c. in 1939. The
div, was lifted from 3.75 p.c. to 5.06 p.c.
As for the outlook, local public works
are expected to take more of the output
during the current term, the new asbestos-
cement factory, now going up alongside
the cement works at Latrobe, is nearing
completion, and, as the shipping position
eases and the larger users of cement
come into the picture again, the co. hopes
to recapture portion of the mainland
trade. Meanwhile, much will depend
upon how the asbestos-cement venture
turns out. Costs are much higher than
pre-war and selling prices are controlled.
The new venture is' reflected in the

Wealth is not
created by
promoting scarcity
THERE are those in our midst who
believe that waste makes wealth
and that plenty brings poverty. It is a
perilous thought for men to foster.
It ought to be clear to all by now
that there is only one thing which
makes a people prosperous. That one
thing is the production of those goods
and services that the people need.
These goods and services are real
wealth. Money itself is not wealth :
it is merely a means of exchanging
wealth. When expanding trade re-
quires more of it, the Banking System
provides it. The amount goes up or
down with the level of business activ-
ity. It is governed by that level and
by that alone.
This Bank, with more than 300
Branches, already serving thousands
of customers, stands ready to supply
credit in full measure to competent
individuals and companies for all con-
structive purposes.

mates went awry owing to anaemic metal
markets—for a while zinc in the ore
didn’t pay for recovery—and advancing
costs and other difficulties. War aggra-
vated troubles connected with manpower,
costs and shipping, and production was
switched from lead-zinc to all-copper in
April, 1943.
Now a ready market at high prices for
all base metals has greatly enhanced the
co.’s prospects, and shareholders’ chances
of coming into the picture in the near
future look bright. Production of lead
bullion and zinc concentrates has begun
again, and a new unit to treat 30,000 tons
of copper sulphides a month is to be
added to the mill. Also, a modern
copper smelter (capacity 1500 tons
blister a month) is to be erected. When
the enlarged plant gets into full swing—
which might be a year or two yet—
annual metal production is expected to
be 2,775,0000 z. silver, 37,000 tons lead,
24,000 tons zinc and 18,000 tons copper.
To meet the outlay on new plant and
other developments, including probable
opening up of a coal deposit near
Hughenden (N.Q.), 2,000,000 new £1 ord.
shares are to be offered those on the
register (approx, one-for-one) at a date
yet to be announced. And some of the
co.’s debt to Mining Trust, the Britannia#
Co. and American Smelting and Refin-
ing Co. is to be funded —loans figure at
£832,407.
The profit last term was £149,410 (up
£23,714), equal to 7.6 p.c. on capital.
Gross eqj-nings (£1,227,337) dropped
£2704. But exes. (£749,698) were £23,299
lighter, debenture interest swallowed
£194,433 (down £2993), and £133,796 (up
£414) was allowed for depreciation. It
was a creditable performance consider-
ing that production of bullion was held
up for 41 days owing to the coal strike
at Collinsville and the loss of revenue to-
ward the close of the term on account of
resumption of lead-zinc production. Flo-
tation of lead-zinc ore began on May 13,
but satisfactory smelting of lead con-
centrates was not achieved until June 7
last.
There was a shrinkage of 30,000 tons
in the quantity of ore treated—2s7,s4o
tons, of which 204,688 tons came from
the copper and 52,852 tons from the lead-
zinc zones. Assay value of the ore was
copper 4.59 p.c.; lead-zinc 5.50 z. silver,
7.8 p.c. lead and 8.5 p.c. zinc. Metal
production compares as follows:

Copper recovery was 93.8 p.c. Excluding
shipping and refining charges, operating
costs were 53.75. (up 5.55.) per ton of
ore.
At June 30 last ore reserves were:
copper section 2,864,000 tons sulphides,
averaging 3.98 p.c. copper, and 58,700
tons rich oxides, assaying 8.1 p.c. copper ;

assaying 6.40 z. silver, 8.6 p.c. lead and

assaying 4oz. silver, 9.4 p.c. lead and
mostly 5.9 p.c. zinc. And the drill re-
cently disclosed a strong lode of run-of-
mine ore. 760 ft. below the 1250 ft. level.
When the books closed there was
£1,149,013 coming to sundry creditors,
etc. Current assets totalled £1,530,811.
The debenture debt amounted to
£2,337,026. Mine and plant figured at
£4,674,737.
In London the' pound shares recently

“Midas”: Recent gold finds are an
incentive to prospecting in Westralia.
Throughout 1946 many fossickers and
small parties over there crushed parcels
of high-grade ore, and in November some
exceptionally rich stuff, estimated to con-
tain hundreds of thousands of pounds’-
worth of gold, was taken out of the
Mountain View at Day Dawn, Murchison
field. Following closely on this discovery
came the announcement that a rich patch,
from which £lO,OOO was obtained, had
been struck in the Christmas Gift block,
near Southern Cross. Prospectors .at
Norseman, Coolgardie, Linden, Broad
Arrow and Meekatharra also had parcels
of rich ore treated at local batteries dur-
ing the year.

SUNDRY SHOWS
STRAUSS AND BALLET.
So rarely does the Sydney stage offer
anything as light, graceful and as near
perfect as the Borovansky Ballet that
one can’t help wishing that Mr. Finnan
would, if Mr. Calwell would let him,
prevent them from returning to Victoria.
Or maybe Mr. Ward could stop them
from recrossing the border or some-
thing.
The ballet is part of “Gay Rosalinda,”
at Sydney Royal, or, more accurately,
it is preceded and followed by that re-
dressing of Strauss’s “Die Fledermaus.”
Certainly the operetta, lavishly dressed
and presented as it is, and light, tuneful
and flippant as it may be, is forced into
second place by the classic beauty and
precision of the Borovanskys. Any re-
collections of the Strauss melodies and the
nonsense that goes with them in the first
act are instantly eclipsed by the dancing
of Edna Busse in the second, and the
memory of her delicate precision - refuses
to be dislodged by anything that happens
in the third act.
There is something about Miss Busse
that is as airy and unreal as a dragon-
fly hovering, sweeping and darting over
a pool. The gossamer lightness of her
dancing is Columbine and the perfection
of her movements —punctuated by poses
as fragile and as beautiful as frost
patterns —are probably something Strauss
never anticipated. Had he done so, and
had he expected the mercurial dancing
and miming of Martin Rubinstein in the
Can-Can and the sinuous agility and
and grace of Janet Wilkie and Vassile
Trunoff as gipsy lovers, he would prob-
ably have reshaped the whole piece.
The light melodies, the romantic in-
tricacies and philanderings, the incon-
sequential cross plots and other non-
sense, and the extravagant and colorful
dressing and staging that take up most
of the time of “Gay Rosalinda” are all
tossed about lightly enough by Tara
Barry, Muriel Howard, Max Oldaker,
Richard Watson and other inveterate and
capable tossers-about of light musical
fare. But the Borovanskys shine through
them like a gem in a lolly basket
"Antigone."
Sophocles’ drama has been given a
distinct modern twist by Jean Anouilh,
whose “Antigone” had its first night at
North Sydney Independent Theatre last
Thursday, Instead of the traditional
Greek chorus Kenneth Fowles steps for-
ward in a dinner jacket and explains the
tragic coil involving Antigone, daughter
of CEdipus, her uncle Creon, King of
Thebes, and her* dead brother, to whom
Creon denies lawful burial, Fowles does
his job excellently, painting clear pic-
tures in clear well-balanced words.
Considering the change iri dramatic
conditions and the difference between the
Greeks, with their love of form and
euphony, and ourselves, with our love of
radio announcers and newspaper column-
ists, the expedient works very well. And
if dramatic euphony was wanting, on
Thursday night the rain beat and ham-,
mered on the Independent roof as an 1
effective addition to the drama.
Creon and the others were dressed in
dinner jackets and modern gowns. The
guards were typical “tough” policemen.
It was, in fact, not Sophocles at all—the
main modern interest lies, not so much
in the externals, but in the fact that the
play was produced in Paris in 1943 during
the occupation and that it was a symbol
of authority and resistance. As such it
is admirable. Creon is no vulgar tyrant.
He is an intellectual, a patron of the arts
with a subtle mind. Nor does he wish to
destroy Antigone for defying him and
burying her brother. Nor is her -brother
—as Creon reveals in a powerful scene —
an admirable character. Another highly
symbolic role was that of Ismene, the
beautiful, pleasure-loving sister, the dis-
ciple of commonsense.
John Carlson, as Creon, was good.
Doris Fitton, as Antigone, was astonish-
ing—she rose to dramatic heights which
this commentator has never seen her
attain before; And the performance, as
a whole, was powerful and dramatic.
Georgie Wood.
Georgie Wood opfened his season at
the Melbourne Tiv. with a sort of apology
for being 21 years older than when he
made his first appearance in Australia.
Possibly he was thinking of the unfortu-
nate reception Little Tich was accorded
in the same playhouse when an audience
showed its disapproval in uncompromis-
ing fashion by heaving pennies at him,
an intolerable insult which caused the
comedian to tear up his contract. The
audience —and Tich —were laboring under
a misapprehension on that occasion. The
jokes that Tich came with had been
heard a million times before from local
jesters and his funny business had similar
whiskers on it. What the audience didn’t
know was that they were all Mr. Tich’s
own invention and had been pinched
from him.
Mr. Wood, however, need have no
fears on that score. The diminutive
mime plays the pathetic small boy with
an almost incomprehensible Scots accent,
but he doesn’t depend on wisecracks.
There is a rare humanity about him which
gradually gets the sympathy of an audi-
ence, as in his tale of the boy who takes
a bag of lollies to his aunt in the hope
that she will give him a birthday present.
There is enough human observation in it
Ito prevent the act ever becoming old-
w fashioned.
Also on a full bill are the tired juggle/
Rebla, the Leotards, whose teeth and
fingers are stronger than most people’s
bodies, the three Kwams, who do an
astonishing balancing act with a mini-
mum of equipment, and a Swan ballet
some considerable distance after Pavlova.
Kuringai Theatre Guild.
Anticipating a 10-o’clock vote at the
liquor referendum in the Ides of
February, the Kuringai Theatre Guild
staged Frank Harvey’s “Saloon Bar” —
hours 8.15 till 11—-and showed how quiet
meditation by the public over a nocturnal
pot or two can even solve a murder.
Peter Trebilco acts well in the part of
Harris, the witty bar-fly who solves the
crime, and is assisted spiritually by
Shelagh Charleston, who, as Ivy, handled
her taps and dialogue with a practised
hand. Joe Batty was the best performer
on the establishment, and by sitting in
his corner throughout consuming old-
mild and saying “Hmfph” at perfect
moments, he brought everything but the
prices down. So fill them up, Ivy —one
for yourself, for Joe and Peter —and
charge them to the scribe. Others in
the cast may buy themselves a sarsapa-
rilla.
Brahms Festival.
The First Symphony and the Requiem
concluded the Sydney Brahms festival.
Brahms was 43 before he finished the
First Symphony, after almost 10 years’
work on it. It is a musical parallel to
Gray’s' “Elegy.” The orchestra under
Percy Code gave a firm, knowledgable
reading.
The German Requiem Opus 45, a
memorial to Schumann and (in the fifth
movement) the composer’s mother, is a
“heavy” which once stung Bernard Shaw
to sarcasm. Despite an over-emphasis
on grief and despair, however, it has
some stirring choruses in the Handelian
manner. The Hurlstone Choral Society
sang “How Lovely Is Thy Dwelling
Place” and “Now Death Is Swallowed
Up with Victory” with admirable spirit.
Ruth Pearce Jones, who sings Brahms as
well as any soprano in the country, sang
Who Now Sorrow,” and John
Probyn used his resonant baritone to
good effect.'
AT THE TALKIES.
“Cherevichki”
Union Theatre, at Melbourne Univer-
sity, is showing a film of Tschaikowsky’s
lively comic opera based on a fantasy
of Gogol’s and first produced in 1887.
There is all the charm of an old tradi-
tion in the story.
The setting is a Ukrainian village dur-
ing the Christmas celebrations. The devil
tupis up and makes love with Solokha,
the village witch, whose son is the black-
smith and is in love with the beauteous
Cossack Oksana. She will only marry
him if he gets her the Empress’s slippers.
The devil steals the moon and produces
a snowstorm in order to upset their
courtship. He gets hidden in a sack and
is carried off by the blacksmith, who has
a struggle with him, mounts his back
and flies off to the palace, where he
succeeds in inducing the Tsarina to hand
over her footwear.
There is a Russian robustness about
the acting, the music is superb, and the
singing splendid. The naturalness of the
photography is as refreshing as the
absence of political propaganda.
“The Years Between’
Believing that her husband has been
killed in action the wife carries a torch
for him £or two years and then sets about
rearranging her life. She wins his seat in
the House of Commons, establishes her-
self as an independent and self-reliant
woman and is on the eve of re-marrying
when the husband returns after four years
in a prison camp. That, briefly, is the
framework of this English offering, at
Sydney Mayfair, with Valerie Hobson,
Michael Redgrave and James McKechnie
playing the main roles. The most interest-
ing and most pertinent part of the film
—the reconciliation between husband and
wife and the manner in which they over-
come the difficulties arising from the fact
that the four years’ separation and the
circumstances under which they have
lived during that time have made them
into two very different individuals —is
skidded over very lightly and with only
momentary realism. In their drive for
mass production and popular appeal Eng-,
lish films are developing a familiarity and
slickness at the expense of their original
artistry and realism.
“Three Strangers”
Although the strangers in this opus at
Sydney Plaza weave through the trickiest
alley-ways of circumstance, they are easy
to follow, particularly Sydney Green-
street, 20 stone of villainy, who leaves
tracks several inches deep. His light-
weight offsidef, Peter Lorre, has a sinister
Mo-like leer which marks him like a trig-
point, while the female member of the
gang, Geraldine Fitzgerald, nests buzzard-
like on high in her posh London sur-
roundings and can be easily spotted from
her habit of burning cigarette holes in
her husband.
* * * *
“Our Hearts Were Growing Up”
(Victory) is a sequel to the better film
“Our Hearts Were Young and Gay.”
However, this latest exposure of the
guileful female blood-thumper has its
moments and gives good documentary
material for bachelors who want to stay
that way. Acting honors go to Billy de
Wolf, whose other performance in “Blue
Skies” confirms the opinion that he is an
escaped member of that admirable
orchestra fed and wardered by Spike
Jonqs.

AND IT'S
RED MILL RUM.
Though the 26 starters in the sj-furlongs
Oakleigh Plate at Caulfield on Saturday looked
about as open a field as any punter’s night-
mare could have conjured up, backers made
Chisel Beach a 3-to-l favorite. That was on
the strength of his easy A.N.A. Handicap win
and previous successive wins in S.A., but half
the field had been first or placed at their last
starts, including the ultimate winner, Kind
Link, who had won in four of her six previous
starts, and in one of the failures had been
left standing at the post. Punters, however,
had Kind Link second favorite at 9 to 1,
which was good enough picking in the circum-
stances, even though Chisel Beach was never
sighted.
A four-year-old brown mare by St. Magnus,
sire of St. Fairy and other good ones, Kind
Link, getting away fairly well from the barrier
scramble, in which Chisel Beach was lost, was
never worse than fifth or sixth, and was third
into the straight behind the lightly-weighted
three-year-old High Title filly Rhythm Queen,
a successful country performer who at that
stage was a good two lengths ahead of the
third favorite, Bravesia. An exceptionally fast
one, Rhythm Queen had taken the lead in the
first couple of furlongs, but in the straight
she was passed by Kind Link, Glenfern and
Hispano, in the places, with Pulfham and
Delano next. Kind Link carried 8.3, ran it
in 1.5 i, and won by a length and a half.
Kind Link represents about as happy an
example of casting bread upon the waters as
the Turf could show. When her dam Chortle’s-
racing days ended Chortle was presented by
her owner, J. Bird, to G. R. Nicholas, of the
Shirley Park stud, and in turn Nicholas gave
Chortle’s first foal, Kind Link, to J. Bird’s
son Harry.
The Oakleigh running did not appear to say
much for present Sydney sprinting form, Syd-
ney having sent down its biggest contingent
of competitors for some time, and none of
the five of them gained a place. It could as
fairly be said, however, that the handicapper
overrated some of them, compared with the
Melbourne runners,. Of the first six in the
weights, four were the Sydney perfortmers
Cragsman and Victory Lad (equal topweights
at 9st. with La Patrice), Puffham (8.10) and
Oriental (8.3). Cragsman had not won a race
for eight months and had meanwhile per-
formed indifferently; both Victory Lad and
Puffham had done nothihg in the same time
to say much for their, chance under heavy
weights in such an event as an Oakleigh, and
Oriental’s recent best was to have very luckily
scrambled home by half a head from Gay
Queen at Moonee Valley. Kind Link was in
it with Oriental’s weight, and at that was carry-
ing a 51b. penalty.
The Oakleigh result said nothing either way
about barrier positions, for, though the last
eight to finish were drawn near the outside
(including Cragsman, who was sent there for
fractiousness), the winner started from 12 out
and the second horse from 24, both having
come in one through Cragsman’s shift.
If all the successful Dhoti products hold
their galloping ability as they get older and
face up to longer distances they must just
about dominate Australian racing over the
next few years. Since Dhoti would not have
been so highly regarded as a breeding propo-
sition in England as he has proved in Australia,
it should also be interesting to see how the
stock of the several more fancied ones lately
imported turn out.
Dhoti’s record is almost freakish. It has
been noted here for many months past that
there’s seldom a Melbourne meeting at which
one or more of his stock fails to win, and
on Saturday they cleaned up the two-year-olds’
double, Denhoti, a bay colt from Denis Pop,
defeating Carnage and Chartist in the colts
and geldings’ section of the 5-furlongs Federal
Handicap, and Jalna, a chestnut filly from
Gallantic, winning the fillies division from
Surma (another Dhoti) and English Maid.
Jalna, who has a defeat of the smart Lady
Ajax to her credit, ran Isec. better time than
Denhoti, cutting the five furlongs out in 59£,
only quarter of a second outside the course
record. She started from the extreme outside
and led all the way.
As in the Oakleigh, winning form was best
form in the 12-furlongs Bond Handicap,
Logical, Cherie Marie and Amelia, who finished
in that order, being all last-start winners. It
applied also to the nine-furlongs St. George
Stakes (w.f.a.), Attley again winning (at 7
to 4 on), this time from Russia and Star Act,
with Flight unplaced. Russia finished very fast.
Another of the consistent brigade, the six-
year-old Artec horse Bronx, winner at five
of his last six starts, carried 9.12 and very
easily won the mile Salisbury Welter, with
Valour and Lord Beaufort in the places. The
Welter topweight was the four-year-old Black
Law, with 10.1. He looks big enough and
good enough to carry anything, but that burden
appeared to anchor him, and he could run
a different race under a lighter scale. He
ran fourth. A. Breasley was soaked £2O
for not riding him full out.
The South Australian Spawater was a 6-to-4
favorite for the Warren Hurdle, despite the
tidy burden of 12.1. He was bowling along
very well, too, but hit a hurdle and lost his
rider. Surviving a protest for interference at
the last jump, Azores won it from Nantilla and
Ruthless. The interference looked palpable
“She hits a divot further thun anyone else in the club.”
enough, but the view evidently was that Azores
comfortably held Nantilla afterwards.
Best runs of the day included Logical’s four-
lengths defeat of Cherie Marie, and the second
to Attley of Russia, who would not yet be
properly ready. Honest Puffham’s fourth in
the Oakleigh, at a distance a bit short for
him, was not a bad run, either, especially at
the weights. Jalna won like a really good
filly.
* * * *
Except for the 7|-furlongs Flying, won by
Tamaroa (E. Fordyce) from Smooth Action
and Euryalus, and the Frank Underwood Cup,
in which Invictus (T. Mullane) defeated Right
Royal and Marcontine, the S.T.C. meeting at
Canterbury was mostly a day for what may
be politely called moderates. Not that -one or
two well-performed starters in the main events
did anything to warrant cheers.
In the Flying, Yankee Lad, who had downed
Columnist and Dutchman at his previous start,
ran a wretched race, tailing the field all the
way; but he went out in a lather, looking
very upset about something. In the small
field of half a dozen in the Cup, Craigie did
manage to run fourth, but on his early form
9st. (71b. taken for J. Eaves) shouldn’t have
stopped him from beating that opposition easily.
He looked a shade big. An inquiry into
Craigia’s run was? opened and adjourned.
Three of the other events were divisions of
a six-furlongs Encourage, the first going to
Nigeria (E. Fordyce) from Vocal Gem and
Move On; the next to Hijacker (Fordyce) from
Vagitus and Invincible; and the third to Trover
(J. Eaves) from Dieppe and Heroic Age.
Fordyce made it a treble on Tamaroa in the
Flying, and the other ex-Queenslander, G.
Moore, rode a double, landing the Posterity
colt Protect an easy winner from Rabelais and
Cetewayo in the six-furlongs event for two-
year-olds, and winning the nine-furlongs Welter,
on Darnley, half a length too good for Asset,
with Pearl Trader a close third. In a Maiden
event over nine furlongs, The Marine (F.
Williams) got there from Doubloon and
Penthrillus.
Protect, a nice sort of brown colt from
Wkidstrcam, should be capable of repeating
the dose, and Cetewayo, a Dark Lover-Herlani
colt, looks sure to improve, though he was
certainly well enough beaten. Rabelais didn’t
get the break on the field he was able to
take at Randwick. With that sort of advantage
he has the speed to win one, but he seems
to lack heart. He’s a Titan, and that late
sire’s stock is not turning out as well as it
promised. „•

The prizes are big in U.S. racing, but it costs
something to go after them. For this year’s
Belmont Stakes the starting fee has been bumped
up from $5OO to $lOOO. Ninety-five three-year-
olds were ruled eligible to go in for it, and the
winner’s owner will collect about $BO,OOO.
The Oakbank Easter Monday entries in S.A.
have topped all records, including also those
from other States. The Great Eastern Steeple-
chase of £2500 gets 73, the Harry Young
Hurdles 62, and the Onkaparinga Cup of £lOOO

M.C.C. v. Victoria: —
Keeping up his excellent form, Compton hit
up 93 of England’s total of 355 against Vic-
toria at Melbourne. He went to a brilliant
catch by Miller, who held a hot return from
his own bowling. Ikin (71) and Fishlock (51)
were best of the rest.
Another of the Harvey family, Neil, an 18-
year-old, scored 69 of Victoria’s 171 (for six

(68 not out when the second day’s play ended)
the Victorians, even including Miller, failed
badly, mostly victims to Evans’s fine ’keeping.
A light M.C.C. engagement v. Vic. Country
at Ballarat ended in a draw: Vic. Country 268
and 5 for 70; M.C.C. 288. Two local lads
distinguished themselves, McArthur getting
Edrich and Fishlock for “ducks,” and Plummer
taking 4 for 68. After Evans’s bulwark job
in the fourth Test it was a change to see
him top score with a vigorous 82. For the
locals, Brown scored 62 and Stephens 40.

N.S.W. flopped (all out for 145), but in the
rest of Saturday’s play S.A. shaped no better:
three for 47. For'S.A. Noblett took 4 for 25
and O’Neill 5 for 28. Lindwall bagged 2

Undefeated through the season, Western
Suburbs is romping in an easy winner in Syd-
ney first-grade cricket premiership. There are
still a couple of matches to play, but the
club can’t be headed. Only 12 players have
represented West in the matches; N.S.W. selec-
tors didn’t pick one player froga the club
for first-class fixtures.

“Oxmead”: Denis Compton, who saved Eng-
land from defeat in the fourth Test match, is
one of the select band who have represented the
Old Country at both cricket’and football. In
the latest book published about Britain’s ex-
Prime Minister (The Life and Times of Winston
Churchill, by Malcolm Thomson) is a photo-
graph taken just before the start of the inter-
national Soccer match between England and
Scotland at Wembley in October, 1941. “Mr.
Churchill,” says the caption, “was the guest
of the Football Association on this occasion,
and is here seen shaking hands with Denis
Compton, the famous Arsenal footballer.” I
suppose there have been others to earn the
dual distinction, but they must be very few.
A. E. Stoddart was the first, I think, but of
course Rugby football was his game. Later
“double-blues,” to use a ’Varsity term, are
more likely to have come from the leading
Soccer clubs.

Simmons often fought Coleman from one

Putting a Price on Shares
Industrial investment and political con-
ditions in Australia and many other parts
of the world at present being in a state
of flux, a new approach has to be made
by investors in appraising Stock Exchange
securities. At least it is necessary to
value stocks and shares on a basis con-
siderably different from that acceptable
in the days before Stock Exchange re-
strictions were imposed and the com-
munity was compelled to live in what,
during war-time, became virtually the
totalitarian State.
Since .the war there has been a gradual
modification of war-time regulations, but
still we are living and working under a
number of basic controls. Among these
are price-controls, interest-rate fixation,
credit restriction (including control of
new capital issues), import and export
and exchange controls, and heavy taxa-
tion —in itself a most drastic “control.”
Furthermore, there is unofficial but Gov-
ernment-supported trade-union control in
some industries, and there is always the
threat of nationalisation of industries
where trade-unionism is strong enough
to demand it, Sometimes near-riationali-
sation takes place wheft the employees
of the particular industry are opposed to
it, as was the case with our private banks.
General trade-union policy prevailed in
that case.
Price-control restricts profit-earning in
the first place, while heavy company
taxation takes a large cut of whatever
profits are earned. Private enterprise no
longer has a reasonably free hand, and
has very little room to manoeuvre.
Prior to the war there was no price-
control, and company taxation was a
minor item; in addition, shareholders re-
ceiving dividends were entitled to a
rebate of tax up to the rate paid by the
company. In 1939, too, employment-
giving was regarded as a major respon-
sibility of private industry, and high and
efficient production was a necessary aim.
For some time past the Government has
in theory assumed responsibility for “full
employment,” and has been inclined to
regard private initiative and the profit
motive as a secondary consideration. It
has undertaken responsibility also for a
wide redistribution of incomes in the
form of pensions, child endowment, etc.
But the “Labor” Government is being
forced to change its mind to some extent
about the value of private industry. It
is finding that employment which is a
charge on the national Budget is un-
productive of much in the way of goods
and services or secondary employment,
while at the same time it has been keep-
ing taxation burdens high without lessen-
ing the inflation danger. Lack of essen-
tial goods and services, housing and trans-
port is causing unrest throughout the
country. There is thus a tendency to
buck against the Government’s former
theory of sponsored “full” employment,
and to look more to private enterprise for
jobs. True, we have seen numerous
strikes in„ which radical union elements
have demanded that the Government take
complete control of a particular industry,
but only in rare instanbes has such Gov-
ernment action been taken.
Accepting a longish-term view there
are thus hopes that Australia will work
its way out of the excess of controls that
now enthral it, chief ground for these
hopes being the obvious impractibility of
the Government’s economic and indus-
trial policy. It is plain that anarchy has
become rampant in most key unions.
Especially where the Government is em-
ployer or quasi-employer, and that the
benefits and powers handed during the
war to the trade-union movement as a
body have not been accepted with a
fitting sense of responsibility. To prevent
industrial suicide the initiative of private
enterprise must be largely returned, and
trade-union anarchy outlawed.
That is a justifiable long-term view to
take. Meantime the price-control, the
high taxation and the industrial anarchy
remain. There is an acute shortage of
female labor, in the textile industries par-
ticularly, and it may be that wages in the
trade will have to be raised before there
is any relief. This : would mean higher
.prices to the consumer. But, prbvided the
reason for the shortage of female hands
is that wages are relatively too low and
not that living conditions in other spheres
are too easy at present, then higher wages
will have to be faced. Profit margins
would need to be maintained, otherwise
the lack of production incentive in in-
dustry would become even more obvious
than it is today.
Interest-control has brought down the
yields to investors in Consols, mortgages,
bank deposits, etc,, to record low levels.
“Did I leave my brooms here , Mr. Dingle?”
rates are artificial, like so many
other things, but for the present they are
a factor in establishing share prices.
There is a tendency to value some shares
on present yields rather than future pros-
pects. This habit has its obvious dangers.
If, in the interests of greater production,
better living standards and national
economic security, industry is encouraged
to increase its output and profits there
may be a swing away from retailer and
similar stocks at present showing high
yields and a much greater concentration
upon shares in essential industries show-
ing prospects of wider expansion and
market appreciation.
It is undeniable at the moment that
our productive industries have greater
opportunities ahead of them just as soon
as willing labor is available in sufficient
quantities and restrictions on prices are
removed. No one is in favor of profiteer-
ing, but it is clear to most people that
arbitrary price-controls are cumbersome
and inhibiting, however essential as a
temporary measure, and that competitive
enterprise is the most fruitful source of
economical production.
A factor which investors will have to
watch when competitive production does
return is that of relative efficiency. Whilst
nearly all goods are in short supply and
price-control operates th.e inefficient firm
is often on as good a profit-earning wicket
as a better,-run show- Keen competition
could alter all that.
It is the belief here that well-run in-
dustrial concerns occupying a ipajor place
in key industries will turn out best for
investors in the long run however moder-
ate present yields may be. A thing to
be remembered is that new plant is going
to cost a great deal more than that in-
stalled before the war, and that estab-
lished businesses owning substantial plant
now will have a capital-assets reserve up
thear sleeves by comparison with, new
competitors. That is in cases, of course,
where the old plant is as efficient as the
new, and has not become outmoded by
developments.
Commonwealth expenditure out of
revenue for the seven months to January
31 seems, on first view, to be well below
Budget estimates. But if self-balancing
items —at present largely book-entries —
are excluded the average monthly outgo
is not far below predictions. Total outgo
from revenue for the seven months, in-
cluding self-balancing items, is £217.2
million, compared with a Budget estimate
of £405 million for the year. Revenue
has been buoyant, more especially Cus-
toms, excise, sales-tax and post-office
income. Loan-fund spending for war
and other purposes totalled £20.4 million
to January 31, compared with the *y ear’s
forecast of £7l million. Strikes, etc., are
making it very difficult to get ahead with
Government “works.”

Activity in Oil Search shares, very pro-
nounced early last week, slackened some-
what following an announcement that the
Kariava borehole had reached 6378 ft. on
February 1, and with no other comment
than that casing had been cemented in to
5750 ft. The proposition represents a
thoroughgoing search for oil at a very
interesting stage, and as a speculation—
the nature and precise whereabouts of the
oil resources of New Guinea as yet being
a matter of scientific conjecture—has
many attractions.
Oil Search, Ltd., which has an issue
of about 2,100,000 ss. shares, owns an
interest amounting to nearly a fifth in
Australasian Petroleum Co., the concern
now drilling at great depth for oil in
Papua. Though an oil-strike would
probably justify a large rise in Oil Search
scrip, it is wise to take note of the
number of shares over which it would be
necessary to spread profits derived from
any oil-production. A market of £1 for
each ss. share in Oil Search would mean
a valuation of about £10,000,000 for the
whole Australasian Petroleum Co., while
£lO a share would mean a £100,000,000
capitalisation.

Steamship issues have been weak on
’Change ever since the prices ceiling was
lifted. Huddart Parker has been an
exception. This company has had more
freedom in the operation of its vessels,
not all of the fleet being employed in the
inter-State service. Bad luck overtook
the Wanganella, on the trans-Tasman run,
but it should be back in service again
within a few months, on present reports.
H.P. is a very solid concern financially,
and before the lifting of ’Change ceilings
its shares were much higher in New
Zealand than in. Australia. The portion
of its fleet on the Australian coast is in
the same position as the entire fleet of,
say, Adelaide Steam (intra-State vessels
excepted). Where not still to be returned
by the Navy, these vessels are under
charter to the Commonwealth Govern-
ment at rates not very remunerative.
During the term of Government charter
the labor position has deteriorated
greatly along the waterfront and at sea,
and costs have risen steeply. The Gov-
ernment, as charterer, appears to be in-
curring huge losses. For the present
these losses are no concern of the com-
panies, but they indicate the difficulties
which will confront the owners when the
Commonwealth hands back the ships.
Companies running an intra-State service,
such as North Coast Steam and New.-
castle and Hunter River, have over the
last two or three years been operating
under conditions little different from the
inter-State lines, and profits have dropped
compared with pre-war experience. There
is a lot that is dismal in the immediate
future of shipping cos.; but all have
built up strong finances, and, provided
the period of Government control is just
long enough to carry them in to calmer
waters, with freight rates in keeping with
higher building and operating costs, they
may again return to a front position
among investment stocks,

Other countries are having produc-
tion problems largely the result of
labor troubles. How much they are
merely the result of labor troubles may
be seen when Britain’s case is studied.
.Here is a country more deficient in
natural resources than either Australia or
the United States ; yet, because of a more
stable labor position (Attlee and Laski
notwithstanding), it is leading the demo-
cratic world in the restoration of pro-
duction. Britain is not without its labor
problems, but its people are working
harder than those of this country or
America. It is tragic that these efforts
should at present be hindered by
the elements and by malnutrition.
Whatever labor troubles other countries
may have, Australia is entitled to deal
with its own as an unwarranted and
vicious obstruction to the prosperity of
its people, and to be dealt with accord-
ingly. The remedy lies with the people
of each country individually, and it is not
really our concern whether strikes and
go-slow are either worse or better in the
United States; we must awake to the
realisation that what is going on here is
no good to us, and then do something
about it.

POTTERY is heavy, breakable; most metals discolour.
Yet for centuries no better materials were known for
many articles in everyday use.
Then, about twenty years ago, British scientists dis-
covered Coloured Plastics: light, adaptable, resistant to
wear. Because the chemical processes are complex and
the plant costly, Britain, the United States and Western
Europe were the only sources of aminoplastic materials in
1939. Australia's needs were supplied by Britain.
By arrangement with the pioneers and leading manu-
facturers in. England, aminoplastic resins were made in
Australia early in 1944 —for war purposes only. Recently
the production of moulding powders was inaugurated.
During the war years, demand increased enormously.
Output is at present restricted by shortages of key plant
and materials, but already Australian production is
approaching pre-war usage in quantity.
Aminoplastic resins and moulding powders are pro-
duced under registered trade marks “Beetle" and
“Scarab" by . . .

Tariff policy is under serious discussion
in Australia pending the ppening of the
International Trade Conference overseas
later in the year. The success of this
conference will principally depend upon
the attitude of the United States towards
tariff reduction. In spite of its great pro-
ductivity and natural resources the U.S.A.
remains a high-tariff country, selling to
the world a great deal more than it buys.
Even raw materials like lead, wool and
tallow have to bear a duty on entering
America, hence the difficulty, in normal
times, of Australian products selling to
any extent on the U.S. market even
though we may be buying heavily'from
that country. Before the war it was cus-
tomary for us to buy a good deal more
from the U.S.A. than we sold to it, and
we had to draw on the dollar pool for
the debit balance we owed. Since the war
we have been selling a large amount of
wool to the U.S.A. in spite of a duty
of 34 cents a pound on greasy, and
momentarily we have a favorable balance
of payments. But this is unlikely to con-
tinue indefinitely. For one thing we are
not able to buy American goods at any-
thing like the rate we should like just
now, and for another the world-wide
demand for raw materials may slacken
suddenly later on, with a fall in prices
for wool, etc., in which case the U.S.
tariff barrier would become a real obstacle
again. Before 1939 British Malaya, with,
its rubber and tin exports to America,
was a valuable source of dollars to the
whole Empire. It may not continue to
play such an important part in Empire
trade and finance, especially as the U.S.A.
has tied strings to the dollar-pool arrange-
ments. The United States, in order to.
make world-wide tariff reduction a suc-
cess, will have to realise that the major
aim will be to cut down America’s favor-
able balance of trade not by a restriction
of exports, but by an encouragement of
imports. With a lead given by the United
States, Australia would be in order in
granting reciprocal tariff concessions, and
Empire preference might even be modi-
fied it is freely forecast that it will have
to be. But, regardless of present apparent
exchange advantages—-which are of little
real advantage when we have so little? to
sell Australia is in no position to make
sweeping tariff concessions to any coun-
try unless that country is prepared to
“play ball,” too.

Steamships Trading Co. shares have
appreciated considerably in thq market
following abandonment of price" ceilings.
Buyers have been unable to get the scrip
at 325. Captain Fitch is the main force
behind the concern. Shipping has been
“nationalised” in New Guinea, the co.
and Bums Philp merely acting as man-
aging agents for the Government so far
as Papua is concerned. Steamships Trad-
ing owns rubber and copra plantations,
and has trochus-fishing interests as well
as its merchandising and shipping activi-
ties. Under the supervision of Eddie
Ward the labor and transport position
of New Guinea has rapidly deteriorated,
and the trading position has been made
extremely difficult by “controls.” The
co. made a net profit of £32,015 last year,
equal to 25.4 p.c. on capital, and an all-
round 7| p.c. div. was paid. This profit
was due in part to the extreme demand
for merchandise in the Territories, and it
may not be maintained. Certainly all the
producers living in New Guinea will have
to be assured of fairer treatment and
morfc efficient service than they are now
receiving at the hands of Canberra if the
economic position is to be restored to
health. Finances of Steamships Trading
are in good trim, and, with nearly all
traders starting off from scratch again
following military destruction and army
occupation, it should have a good chance
to participate in the future production
and trading activity of New Guinea.
Given sound Government administration,
these could expand greatly.

Prospective travellers to the United
States should be prepared for very high
expenses. For a room only at a good
hotel the cost may not be so extra-
ordinary—perhaps five dollars a day on
the west coast —but meals are sky-high.
In such a hotel the evening meal would
probably cost at least three dollars; and
with tips that is near enough to pound,
Australian money. Drinks are propor-
tionately dear. An Australian business-
man recently returned from California
said that on the Pacific coast it cost him
£5 to £6 a day to live, allowing for a
moderate amount of ’bus and train travel.
Getting over towards Chicago and New
York expenses are higher again. Restaur-
ants and snack-bars are not as expensive
as hotels to eat in, and these are widely
patronised by American travellers. It
is still difficult to get transport to the
United States, and even harder to get
back. But this state of affairs may im-
prove when the Matson liners of pre-
war days again take up the running.
Hotel accommodation inside America is
hfcavily taxed, and travel people in Aus-
tralia are warning those going to ’Frisco
to be prepared to make rail-transport
arrangements a week ahead. Rail fare
across America costs from £4O to £5O.
Cldthing is freely available again in the
U.S.A. —at a price. Transatlantic cross-
ings are easier to arrange from Australia
than from the U.S.A., but visitors to
Britain are still likely to find a return
booking extremely difficult to arrange.
This position will improve as soon as
the Orient and P. and O. liners get run-
ning on a regular schedule. The Orion
should arrive in Australia soon.

‘Old-timer”; Some time in the night
a high wind tore a couple of sheets of
off the roof of Rainbow’s hut,
which worried him not a bit until the
wind dropped and rain set in. Rainbow
got out of bunk, fumbled round in the
dark and tried to patch that roof. But
the rain rained the more and there was
more wind, and pretty soon the floor of
he hut was awash and the interior a
tine spray of water. Rainbow’s temper
never very long, visibly shortened as he
struggled impotently against the ele-

excited and worried out on his chain set
U P a clamor. Rainbow stood still a

unhooked Boozer’s chain and dragged
ast °nished hound into the hut.
“XT ere are ’ y’l” he roared.
Never flamin’ well satisfied unless y’

damp bunk. “Just like a flamin’ woman,”
muttered Rainbow, aiming a vain kick at
Boozer s rear —“start askin’ a lot o’ silly

An adjacent property owner immediately
identified the spot and comparison
showed the picture to be complete in
all detail. The lightning theory was first-
favorite in this case, and similar instances
were cited. Would the snap have been
taken whilst Bully was browsing at night
in the shallows or had it been latent
since he was spawn?

“Dune Scratcher”: It’s always been
my opinion that dead sea-birds found
ashore after a big storm at sea perished
from starvation (B. 12/2/’47). Theirs
is a voracious appetite and their chances
of keeping it satisfied must be few and
far between. When a big blow stirs
up the sea, driving surface marine life
“Most disappointing—we must admit the mousetrap is more efficient.”
helter-skelter and whipping the tops from
waves, there isn’t much tucker about and
a bird blown far from land wouldn’t last
long.
Reference to the “sports-
man” with a gun (B. 12/2/’47) takes me
back to the only time I ever saw old
Bill Simmonds weep. It was on Tapalin
(mid-Murray) and we had a boss who
respected bird life. It was an unwritten
but rigidly-obeyed rule that when we
wanted a feed of wild duck or pigeon
we went far from Tapalin to do the
shooting, the result being that the vicinity
of the homestead and the river, for a mile
up and down, were always peopled with
large colonies of water- and land-
fowl ranging from tom-tits to brolgas.
One year the boss was away and some
city friends of his arrived to spend a
week’s holiday. They took one look at
our avian congregation and, before we
could raise'a protest, had grabbed their
guns and surged forth in all directions.
We managed to run them down within an
hour or so, but by that time .the big bend,
the sandspit, both billabongs and the land
between were literally strewn with the
dead. It was when one of them, a lout
just out of school, came in proudly dis-
playing a murdered spoonbill that Bill
wept tears of incredulous rage. Then
he downed tools, yoked up his dog-cart,
drove the 17 miles into Euston and, for
the one and only time in his life, turned
informer. The appearance of the trooper
so scared the “sports” that they left for
less scrupulous parts.

“Sundowner”: Sydney newspaper
headlines such as “Three Maneaters
Seen Off Bondi Chased Out to
Sea by Surf boat” might be good
palliative propaganda for Sydney
surfers, but to me it is just another
entry for my Fufphy Diary, and shares
the page with “shark turns on back to
strike” and “paint the soles of the feet
and palms of the hands black and a
shark won’t attack.” Working trochus-
shell on the Barrier Reef with a crew of
native skin divers, my observations have
taught that, whilst the maneater is
cowardly and timid, he is more persistent
than a Red veto at a U.N.O. conference.
Although the divers will work in clear
water with a few sharks around, I have
often been forced to up anchor and move
to another locality owing to their being
too much “shark audience” for so few
players. Any attempt to scare them off
with a rowing-boat or even a power-dory
was as effective as swimming after them
with a fly swat. If the Sydney sharks
are as ferocious and curious as our
northern ones, it would take a fleet of
submersible craft capable of 40 m.p.h.
to scare one shark at a time out to sea.

Ike”: Shortly after the recapture of
Madang in April, 1944, about 40 acres
of land was cleared. there by boongs
working under Australian supervision and
a vegetable garden started. The resultant
lush crops of cabbage, silver beet, beans
and watermelons, however, soon fell to
the ravages of the green beetle. In the
absence of effective garden sprays, wasps
were flown up from the mainland. The
gaily-colored mud-daubers cleaned up the
pests in double-quick time. Since when
I have regarded all wasps with a kindly,
if still dubious, eye.

“Horseless Horseman”: Euston, the
oldest town on the Lower Murray, has —
like the rest of the world' —under-
gone a change. A few weeks ago century-
old Euston station, once headquarters
for half the pastoral runs. in western
N.S.W., was sold for cutting up, and
already around Lake Benanee surveyors
are converting the country into citrus
blocks. At the same time Prill Park,
Euston station’s rival in recent years and
home of that old-time squatter the late
Harry Leslie, has sold all its frontage
country and, though Dougal Leslie re-
tains the lonely backcountry, Gulthall
and Big Moonlight (still 40 miles round
the fence), he intends working these pad-
docks from Mildura. Gone also to
Mildura is Stan Billing, who has leased
Tapalin vineyards on shares, and over
the river at Creswick’s old Happy Valley
cattle station Arthur Hamilton has passed
on to pastures new. Worst of all, Med-
ley’s, the oldest pub on the Murray, has
recently been sold to Ansetts, Ltd., of
tourist, coaching fame. The blow was too
much for old Hughie Mathieson, the
last of an old brigade Who had to dye his
grey hair to go to World War I; Hughie
has cleared off in the scrub 40 miles
north of Benanee to live. About the
only old hands left are the Brett boys
on their self-supporting selection on the
river beside the 25ft. high Mt. Disper-
sion!

“B. A. Ker”: The symposium on the
belligerence of ganders (B. 29/1/’47) re-
minds me that I once ridiculed the idea
that a nesting swan could inflict more
than superficial injuries. Strolling along
a backwater of the Parramatta River
(N.S.W.) I spent an' idle few minutes
watching a black cocker spaniel retrieve
sticks thrown into the water. Sounds of
canine distress brought fne back. Evi-
dently a stick had been thrown near
rushes in which a swan had an interest,
for the bird had emerged in fury and was
laying it on right and left. Cocker was
all in when the white terror decided to
call it a technical knock-out; and if his
master had not valued him more than a
pair of cream flannels the little tyke
would surely have drowned.

“Gryllus”; A striking demonstration
of the vital economic necessity for effec-
tive protection of insectivorous birds has
been provided in the neighborhood of
Home Hill (N.Q.). A grasshopper swarm
passed through a four-acre block of
ratoon cane, eating the grass clear from
between the canes, and headed for a
plant-cane crop on a near-by farm. Help
was summoned from the Inkerman Pests
and Diseases Control Board. By the time
a poisoning party arrived hundreds of
ibises, cranes, brolgas, spoonbills, magpies,
peewees and other feathered epicures had
gathered to attack the 3-in.-deep layers
of crawling invaders between the rows.
There was no peed for any poison. Its
bearers stood and watched until the last
satiated bird had given up its search for
one last ’hopper. Examination showed
that the entire swarm had been destroyed.

“R. Barr” (N.G.): Thought I’d seen
just about all the weapons after six years
of the war, but a boong sprang a new
one on me the other day. To the head of
a six-foot throwing stick he had attached
a powerful spring balance, acquired some-
where around the dumps. The free end
of the spring fitted about the butt of a
seven-foot spear, and he could pelt that
fearsome - looking missile far and fast.
Chronologically out of place, it could
still be easily labelled crossbow.

“Emjai”; “Gravelsnatcher” (B.
22/1/’47) as well as “Zake” has got off
the line in attributing circular wanderings
of the lost to disparity in length of legs
oj passing obstacles always on the same
side. It can happen at night and on open
plain where obstacles do not affect, or
when legs are of equal length. There
are alternative explanations: (1) just as
men are righthanded or lefthanded, so
they are right- or leftlegged and have
developed greater facility and strength
in one leg than the other, with conse-
quent stronger thrust and length of stride
on one side; (2) in few cases is sight
quite true —forward motion is largely
guided by vision, and when the physical
movement co-ordinates with an optical
arrangement more or less out of true,
there is a corresponding veering from the
straight line. The operation of both leg
and vision factors results in a corkscrew
route.
“Greenhide Bob”: Walking in circles
when bushed (B. 22/1/’47) has nothing
on riding away in a straight line and yet
arriving back home, as it was done on
Boyd station in the Bland country when
I was there. The hands set Choom up
on a quiet horse and started him for
Forbes, a few miles away, for tobacco.
It was broad daylight. There was only
a two-chain lane with a wire fence on
each side all the way to the township,
, with'practically no scrub on it, and they
told him to keep the fence on his near
side. It would bring him to the town-
ship. About sundown he pulled up out-
side the fence of the homestead and,
looking dazed and worried, asked some-
one how far it was to Forbes. He was
told he was back home. Inside the hut
(without the tobacco) the mob worked
it out. It appeared that a whirly had
blown his hat off, and while he was on
the ground retrieving it his moke must
have turned round without his noticing it.
Then he only had to keep the fence —the
wrong fence—on his near side to land
back where he started from.

“Frank Mauri”: Turtles aren’t the only
amphibians with no reverse gear (B.
5/2/’47). Crocodiles are caught by some
New Guinea natives by enticing the beast
into a narrow pen with a tethered dog.
Although the entrance is wide open to the
sea behind his tail the saurian will make
desperate attempts to break down his
prison in his efforts to escape.

“C. D. Mine”: Water-divining (B.
29/1/’47) is at a discount around Too-
woomba (Q.) just at the moment. A
dowser issued a challenge through the
press that he could tell by divining the
depths at which different streams and
soakages would be struck and whether
they would be salt or fresh, A local
driller accepted the challenge; three sites
were selected, one near Clifton and two
near Pittsworth. Results of the first two
showed the dowser wrong in every de-
tail on both sites. So next time “Salmon
Gums” engages a diviner let him cut the
stick near the fork so that the cut will
be the weakest part of the rod. If the
thing is genuine the stick should break
or bend at that point. It won’t,

“Kenwood”: The “emu apple,” which
“requires the powerful gastric juices of the
emu’s digestive tract” to soften the seed
cases (B. 5/2/ ’47), is probably a more
superstitious than scientific conclusion.
However corrosive the acidity of an
emu’s stomach, the seed Js not likely to
be more than 12 hours in transit. Com-
pare this with soil acidity, which will en-
tirely remove the galvanising from water
pipes. Some steel fencing posts that I
placed in position nine years ago have
been corroded away almost to ground
level; six-feet posts reduced in height to
five feet. Even if the seeds are of
“granite toughness,” after all they are of
vegetable matter, and surely not harder
or tougher than steel. The seeds of
another native tree, “blueberry ash”
{Elceocarpus cyaneus), are tough and
liable to take three years to germinate,
but eventually the hard cases will break
down. The emu probably serves the
purpose of distributing the seed cases,
but it is soil acidity alone that finally
liberates the imprisoned seed.
HENRY LAWSON’S DAMPER.
When Henry came to bide with us v he told
Tom Mutch and me
That bushmen in the proper sense we had no
hope to be.
Out West, where he aforetime waltzed Matilda
on his back,
We’d perish, and our dried remains they’d find
far off the track.
One day I took him to a lone, abandoned
holding; but
I warned him that his Drover’s Wife could
ne’er have stood that hut,
For all the place was stiff with snakes and,
what intrigued him rrmst,
The tumbledown in which we camped was
haunted by a ghost.
He grinned and lisped that snakes and ghosts
to him were nothing new,
He’d met a teamster’s ghost at Bourke; three
shearers’ ghosts he knew;
And, as for snakes, on getting up at old
Eurunderee
You had to shake them from your boots before
your morning tea. f
“It makes me laugh,” the poet cried, “you
both like townies talk.
Where did you hide that bit of flour? And
where’s the tomahawk?
I’ve got to strip a sheet of bark to mix a
damper on;
You never made one in your lives. I’ll show
you how it’s done.”
Now we had brought a dozen loaves, enough
to last a week;
Which proved — the humorist inferred —we had
no right to speak
Of bushcraft to a seasoned hand who’d humped
his swag ancLJcnew
The virtues of good soda bread as all wise
bushmen do.
We let him go. With sleeves rolled up he
worked a solid hour—
The dottle from his famous pipe was mingled
with the flour —
Then laid his mixture on the ash, announcing
with a grin
“ ’Twill turn out like a wedding cake; we’ll
post a chunk to Quinn.”
I would not from his fame detract. His verses
and his prose
Are “Nature to advantage drest,” as all Aus-
tralia knows.
He was my mate, my lifelong friend, and yet
aghast, afraid,
I trembled when he flaunted forth the awful
thing he’d made.
Black, singed and sodden; soft in spots, in
other parts bone-hard—
We saw we had to separate the baker from the
bard.
I eyed it like a shying horse; Tom Mutch—
in after years
A member and a Minister—laid back rebellious
ears,
f
When Henry with the candlelight reflected in
his brown,
Soft, spaniel eyes invited us: “Sit up and put
it down /"
An emu might, a crocodile, a warrigal, or such,
But not his pale, affrighted friends. . I took
the sign from Mutch
And pinioned Henry’s floury wrists, while Tom
went like a streak
Of lightning for that work of art and hurled
it in the creek.
“Aha!” —set free, the artist cried “That
doubly proves how far
From being real bushmen, as I’ve said you
fellows are.”
*
His pen is in the Mitchell, with George Lam-
bert’s statue near —
I wish we’d kept that damper now, ’twould
be an object dear
To all who love Australia’s Mate; but deep
and far is laid
Among the stones of Nadgee Creek the damper
Lawson made.

“Bo”: The new hand had gone into
the township to the pictures and die
cocky was discussing him with the family.
“He’s a bit of a queer sort o’ coot if
y’ ask me,” he said. “He ain’t ever been
bit be a snake or ever seen a wombat,
he must have his karosene-tin shower
every evenin’ when he knocks off, he’s
up waitin’ for me of a momin’, he don’t
want to know if there’s another vegetable
to go with the spuds, he don’t seem to be
int’rested in the weather and he don't
clean his teeth at the tank with the tap
runnin’, like most o’ the hands we’ve had
did. No, I can’t see him lastin’ here too
long.” “But, Dad,” protested Mum, “he’s
a nice young chap and you can’t hold
those things against him.” “I don’t,”
snapped the old man, “but, cripes, he
can’t play euchre! What sort of a place
must he have been dragged up in?”

“Metax”: Landing back at the farm-
house after taking the dog around the
paddocks, the 16-stone city visitor was
fortunate that he dropped into the
strongest chair, as his little legs, mon-
strous girth and multiple chins all com-
bined to help express his late-for-lunch
apologies. “Sorry I’m last in,” he gasped,
“I couldn’t come any faster —the dogs
were tiring.”

“Thistlebrook”: Milk secretion in
maiden animals, male or female (B.
22/1/’47), isn’t altogether rare. Wethers
and maiden ewes have been known to
secrete milk when grazed on certain sub.-
clover-dominant pastures, particularly in
W.A., where the trouble is fairly pre-
valent. Presence of the female sex hor-
mone, oestrin, is the cause. In normal
female animals this hormone is released
at natural conception or artificially in
male or female by the feed or some other
physiological factor upsetting the balance
of the hormones.

“Zake”: The chief victim of the snake’s
mesmeric powers is the frog, which also
is featured as top item on the ophidean
menu. Perhaps early batrachian sur-
vivors of the horrific ordeal may have
passed on to the tribe the benefits of
mesmerism, for the frogs themselves prac-
tise it very efficiently. I watched a big
green one turn a basilisk eye on a cock-
roach. For almost five minutes they
stared at each other; then the slimy one
leaped at lightning speed, and one could
almost hear the splash as the engulfed
’roach hit the bottom.

“Gryllus”: The next time a plain
turkey gets up within range don’t fire,
good table-bird though it may be. They
are the most useful controls against grass-
hopper plagues that Australia "possesses.
In ’hopper country each one will con-
sume an average of around 70 daily, and
as they live for from five to six years
will account for a good many thousands
in its useful lifetime. At the crawling
stage of the pest they seem to enjoy
killing the nasty-looking creatures even
after hunger is satisfied. Ibises do
good work in the same line, and many
smaller kinds of birds as well. But if
you come across a domestic cat that has
obviously gone bush don’t hesitate to
spare a cartridge on the destructive crea-
ture. As habitual killers of useful small
birds they are worse than foxes.

“McGinty”; Admirable as the various
Abotricians’ efforts have been to explain
away the electric fence, they all have
missed the real point. “Gravelsnatcher”
(B, 29/1//47) went very close by mention-
“What if the rope DOES break! We can get plenty more.”
ing the presence of the vibrator which is
used to pep up the voltage. However,
the tolerance of electric shock is de-
pendent on another factor outside the
influence of volts and amps (apparently
the only electrical units known to the
layman), and this is frequency, which is
the number of times an alternating
current changes direction in a second of
time. The vibrator transforms the insig-
nificant direct current to a high-voltage
alternating current of high frequency,
and h.f. currents have the characteristic
of passing over the surface of their con-
ductors instead of through them. Hence,
sheep and cattle making contact with the
“live” fence receive a high-frequency
shock which passes over the skin, gives
them a fright, but does no harm. Same
when we accidentally come in contact
with the spark plugs of a running car
engine, the h.f. saving us from more than
a momentary shock. Insignificant volt-
ages of low frequency or direct current
pass right through the body—and heart
—and are for that reason often fatal.
By the way, horses don’t have to be wet
of hoof and hide to succumb to 40 volts.
A cable leakage of 25 volts killed a race-
horse some years back, and it cost the
electric-supply authority, for which I was
working, a very elegant penny.
“Bamekaw”; “C. Coral’s” par on
coast-watching in Torres Strait (B.
5/2/’47) recalls a tale of a strange object
floating on the sea. Natives had secured
it on an out-of-the-way beach and zea-
lously, if vaguely, described it. It was
round, white, “plenty big and copper top
belonga him.” This was thought good
enough to bring the naval authorities out,
to find not a deadly mine but an sit-
size frosted electric light bulb, apparently
jettisoned from a passing steamer.

“Betcha”: I doubt whether even Holly-
wood could produce animals as tough as
we breed ’em up north. Our southern
nags must be poorer specimens, for had
any of them been galloped so long after
a stampede as were the nags in “The
Overlanders,” they’d have ended in a
lather of sweat. Northern cattle, too, are
evidently tougher and less spirited. After
a couple of days’ drought that left the
majority of beasts without even a hollow,
the smell of water resulted in a mad-
headed gallop so uncontrollable they
could only be stopped on the very edge
of the water by a silent and motionless
man posted here and there in the semi-
darkness, on foot. The lucky ruse worked
so well that, forgetting their thirst, that
mixed bunch of ugly scrubbers not
only halted and began to mill, but
looked positively shame - faced. I’ve
seen a mob of our Bogong Here-
fords stampede in fright at sight
of a bloke on foot, and while on
foot have stopped an odd beast with a
maximum of noise and movement, but
I wouldn’t care to wager my hide against
a few of theirs that a silent prayer would
start ’em apologising when mad with
thirst.

From John Bechervaise, of Geelong
College:
Rodondo’s vegetation is completely different
from that of the other Bass Strait islands men-
tioned by “Lower Tops’l” (B. 5/2 / ’47), as will
bee demonstrated in due course, when the
•botanical findings of oUr party are published.
The staff of the National Herbarium has
expressed great interest in the distribution of
plants on RodOndo; several of these have never
been reported from any other island in Bass
Strait (including King and the Kent Group).
The most common tree (Melaleuca pubescens )
is not even found on the near-by Promon-
tory, and it attains dimensions unequalled on
the mainland. Far from containing “nothing
of note,” Rodondo where the balance ot
Nature has never been disturbed sustains
splendid forest and innumerable flowers. There
is an undoubted pristine beauty which is diffi-
cult to find on the fire-scarred mainland.
The entomic, saurian and ornithological life
all provide fascinating material; certainly un-
usual forms and variations and, probably, in
the first-mentioned section, a few new species.
All collections and observations support the
theory, that Rodondo has literally been cut off
from the mainland for a period far exceeding
the duration of human history; all life there
is either ab initio or introduced fortuitously
by the agency of flotation, wind or birds.
There are possibly two small rocks below
Rodondo’s cliffs where seals may have been

mam problems ahead. Apart from the possible
activities of these sealers, first brought to our
notice some months ago by the lighthouse
authorities who have always kept the island
more or less under observation, there exists
no evidence or record of an earlier exploration
than our own, and there are cogent reasons
for treating such claims with reserve. How-
“We'll never do any good until we get an air hostess."
ever, no member of the Geelong College party
claimed priority. It is a significant fact that
when mention of the proposed venture was
made in the chief near-by ports on several
occasions months, even years, prior to its
successful accomplishment, from ail sources
came discouragement. Most seamen cited the
information in the Commonwealth “Guide to
Mariners” and refused to assist. Some
categorically stated th%t a landing was impos-
sible. It remained for “a 66-year-old shark
fisherman, A. G. Smith,” to agree to make
the attempt. Doubtless he was not the only
man who could have helped the venture, but,
in fact, he was the first we found who would
do so!
If all the unsought and unsolicited limelight
lately turned on Rodondo encourages a few
more keen boys to “go exploring,” even in
such modest circumstances, it will not have
been wasted gas!

“Blime”: Nick was sitting on the old
form outside the pub door when Jim
arrived. “In for the races this afternoon,
are y’?” Jim asked. “Hear y’ bin bettin’
quite a bit since Bung started this s.p.
business,” “Yair, Ain’t broke more ’n
evens so far,” answered Nick, “but I like
the sporty anyway. Man’s got t’ have a
bit of excitement in his life, after workin’
hard all the week. Just put a quid on me
fancy for the first race.” “Yair?” Jim
turned an ear towards the bar. “Well,
there she is, just startin’ now.” “Gripes,
is it?” Nick rose hurriedly and made a
dash for the trees on the other side of
the road. There, Jim watched him give
his hack a knowing dig in the ribs, and
flop in -the shade. Ten minutes later he
strolled back into the bar. “Y’r nag come
second, Nick,” Bung informed him.
“Did, eh?” grinned the punter. “Well,
take ten bob on the next, will y’, an’ be
sure an’ let’s know what time it’s gonna
start? Y* see,” he explained to Jim,
“Bung tells me later if me nag wins, an’
it’s darned sight better ’n sittin’ through
that long - drawn - out uncertainty o’
bearin’ him fight the race out.”

“Chuck”: Old Bob had worked hard
all his life, saved instead of indulging,
and at last, in comfortable circumstances,
prepared to take things easier. The
phone rang. “Hey, Bob, y’ll be down
as usual to help us -in the saleyards
tomorrow?” came the voice of the
auctioneer. “I’ve put your name on the
Wages sheet.” “Aw, but y’ know them
hours, five till nine at night, is too much
for me now, Jack,” came the protest.
“Y ? said if I helped y’ till after the war
it’d do.” “Yes, but I can’t get anybody
else, Bob.” “Can’t y’ put on one o’
them young blokes,” suggested Bob.
“They’d be glad o’ the money, like as
not, whereas I got t’ give half it back in
taxes, so it don’t pay me.” “But the
youngsters don’t know stock,” argued the
auctioneer, “and it’s a big sale. Gripes,
don’t let us down, Bob. I’m stuck, I tell
y’.” “Awright, if it’s like that. I’ll
come.” The following day was a scor-
cher, and old Bob had been dripping
sweat for hours when Flynn arrived with
a mob to be drafted. He left instructions,
and retired to the shade. “Hanged if I’m
going t’ help old Bob,” he remarked to
a crony. “Y’ know, that bloke’s worth
more ’n any one of us, yet the lousy old
skinflint still comes down here workin’
round the saleyards, just t’ scrounge a
measly day’s wages.”

“Solitude”: Down-country on a drov-
ing trip Seventyfiver dropped in on
Baldy Pete, just as the baker left Pete’s
house. Picking up the bread Mrs. Pete

prodded it suspiciously, then handed it to
Baldy. “Yair,” growled the boss, squeez-
ing it in turn ; “rung in a loaf o’ yestid’y’s

“Gripes, no,” declared the old bloke,
stoutly. “We’re away most o’ the time

I c’n tell y’,” “Get delivered?” “You

slowly, “I don’t say there ain’t some
things are a bit orf occasion’ly, but
thank goodness we don’t have no trouble

“Hanko”: We lazed on our bunks
while the hut table was occupied by Big
Joe and Snowflake playing draughts and
by Little Joe tinkering with an alarm
clock. Snowflake had Big Joe’s remain-
ing four draughtsmen yarded into a
corner, and his bluish underlip was
aquiver with anticipation of victory.
Little Joe was sitting at ease, smugly
awaiting the alarm mechanism to func-
tion the way he wanted it to. It did,
and thereat commotion. At the startling
jangle of the alarm the three men sprang
to their feet, the table wobbled and
spilled board, draughtsmen and alarm
clock on to the floor. In a fury Snow-
flake leaped on Little Joe and choked
him down, while Big Joe, shy of an
adversary, vented his spit© on the clock.
We neutrals sprang from our bunks,
grappled with the warlike trio and eventu-
ally calmed them down. The dust motes
began to settle back to the floor, and
in a corner of the hut, beside a broken
bootlast, an ill-used timepiece ticked
away contentedly.

“Bufo”; Queensland’s importation in
1935 of 100 giant toads from South
America to tackle the sugar-cane bug has
had some unexpected results. Although
they have increased enormously and have
spread southward almost to the N.S.W.
border they have not made much impres-
sion on the bugs. Weighing anything up
to a pound and from four to eight inches
long, their unobtrusive brown color and
nocturnal habits have produced car-skids
on surfaced roads. Beekeepers are now
complaining that the ugly immigrants are
well on the way to wrecking the honey
industry in many districts by sitting out-
side hive-entrances at dusk and gathering
in the homing bees with swift flicks of
their 6in. tongues. They are proof
against stings, and as many as 500 dead
bees have been counted in the stomach of
one toad. Damage to the extent of £3OO
in one apiary has been reported, and
other serious losses also. The only effec-
tive protection is to raise all hives at
least 2ft. or more from the ground, or
to enclose the whole apiary with wire-
netting of suitable mesh fo/ admitting
bees but excluding toads.

THE MAN ON
THE LAND
"DON'T WORRY. I'M SENDING IT TO
GRAZCOS."
The Wool Position.
“Graz”: Britain has agreed to dip into
her meagre funds with a loan of
£A 15,625,000 to help France continue
buying wool. A £10,000,000 wool deal is
also being arranged between the U.S.,
Australia and Japan to enable Japan to
take about 300,000 bales of lower-grade
Australian wool. Japan was formerly
the world’s second-largest buyer of wool.
Recent offers at auction for carbonis-
ing types have at times been less than
war-time appraisements. In pre-war days
the cost of carbonising ranged from
to 6d. per pound—higher now. At the
moment buyers are after wool that can
be quickly turned into textiles.
For the five months ending November
30 1,949,196 bales were shipped from
Australia, the Continent taking 901,500,
the U.S. 590,673 and the U.K. 355,544
bales. In 1945-46 Australian mills pro-
cessed 407,245 bales. Argentina has un-
loaded 45 p.c. of her stock-pile wool,
Britain reduced hers from 10,000,000
bales to 6,400,000 before handing over
to J.O. About 520,000 bales of Dominion
wool were sold on British markets for the
half-year ending December 31, most o'
it from accumulated stocks. Uruguayan
stocks are negligible, but the U.S. has
1.500.000 bales of domestic wool, and
efforts are| being made to induce the
Commodity Credits Corporation to un-
load it at prices lower than similar wools
can be imported.
Bulkier fleeces in Victoria and S.A. —
both States had good rains last year—
have pushed the estimated Australian clip
up to 3,107,878 bales, or 200,000 more
than in 1945-46, Queensland is down
63.000 bales and N. S. Wales down
22,700 through drought.
Brands in Wool.
“Atlanta”: Growers who argue that
buyers do not pay more when brands
have been removed and that there is no
inducement for growers to remove them
should remember that in arriving at a
basis of value the buyer must consider
all costs, from the raw-wool stage to the
finished cloth. Expense incurred in brand
removal forms part of costs, and costs
invariably work back to the grower.
Where growers must brand the Aus-
tralian Wool Board advises that they
should use small brands and either clip
the brands before shearing or remove
them from the fleece in the wool-room.
In Adelaide, from the 1939-40 season on-
ward, approximate cost (covering wages
of sorters and overlookers only) of sort-
ing fleece or back wool, nearly free from
brands represented 0.57 d. per scoured lb.
Costs for sorting and overlooking wools
moderately contaminated with brand
rocketed to fully Id. per lb. Bad lots
could reduce a sorter’s capacity from
four or five bales daily to one bale.
Testing Cows.
“Aerogenes”: “Rooster” (B. 1/1 / ’47)
seems to have overlooked that I did urge
testing for butterfat production as often
as possible, as well as weighing of the
milk at every milking. Some herd-testing
schemes suggest, others insist, that the
“Now buck!”
milk be weighed all the time. My cattle
were stud animals, and all the milkers
were officially tested. Moreover, those
not up to the standard of the Advanced
Register were culled to the butcher. After
20 years of breeding there were few culls,
and, in spite of recent bad seasons and
shortage of concentrates in Queensland,
the herd of 60 cows, aged two to 17
years, averaged over 3001 b. of butterfat
per cow in 1946. The best of them were
good enough to win country butterfat
championships and to run third in some
butterfat classes in Brisbane.
Weighing at every milking was done
during all of 1946, and will be continued
in any dairy which I control. It is as
close as we can get to the actual pro-
duction picture of each cow, and with
close observation and a sympathetic
attention to the cows’ needs we were
able accurately to determine small ups
and downs in production—too small to
be noticed otherwise —to adjust the feed-
ing immediately so as to conserve food
and use it most efficiently and to assess
other factors such as distance from graz-
ing, exposure to weather, etc.
We found that exposure to cold or
very wet weather caused a loss of 10
gallons per cow per year, and we planned
shelter to prevent that. Several cases of
tick fever were detected early and cured
quickly, because the drop in production
was more apparent on the milk chart
than were the other early signs of fever
on the cows in the yard—especially to
the casual eye of the ordinary milking
hand. Mammitis can —and does —occur
as, first, a drop in the yield of one or
more quarters, with little noticeable dif-
ference in the appearance of the milk,
followed later by the more obvious
changes in the milk and the udder. A
start of 12 hours in diagnosis and treat-
ment may save a cow, which would pay
for quite a lot of weighing and recording.
“Rooster’s” praise of a programme of
breeding, feeding, hygiene and testing is
admirable ; but it is only lip-service if
he is not prepared to apply the pro-
gramme in enough detail to make it rea-
sonably accurate. Two-monthly or
monthly testing, or even the fortnightly
cheque from the dairy company, are
much too infrequent as guides to the
feeding scheme, which should be changed
to suit changes in food requirements and
in the feed supply, which occur almost,
daily. The monthly test might happen on
a day that is abnormal one way or the
other and thus give a false picture for a
month or two. The drop in the dairy
cheque might be owing to a fault in the
cream separator.
I admit that most dairying is still done
by rule of thumb and that much of it is
comparatively successful in spite of that.
Recently, however, the fight over values,
prices, awards, costs of production and
of living, social ethics and economics in
general has become so fierce that any
dairyman who wishes to remain a dairy-
man —and solvent —must neglect no
opportunity profitably to improve his
technique and thus to consolidate his
position.
Strain 19 Vaccine.
“Agric”: Strain 19 is being used by the
Queensland Agricultural Department in
the vaccination of calves as a first step
in control of contagious abortion. To
date, most of the work has been con-
fined to herds whose history was known
through previous tests for c.a., and in
herds already tested. Calves from four
to eight months old were vaccinated to
protect them against infection. The
Acting-Director of Animal Husbandry
(Dr. J. Legg) urges great care in the use
of strain 19 —a living vaccine with a
virulent strain of the actual organism
which causes the disease. Under the
Queensland Diseases in Stock Act a per-
mit must be obtained from the Chief
Inspector of Stock before anyone outside
officers of the department can use the
vaccine. Continuous testing has proved
a long and arduous job, particularly as
the department is shorthanded in
veterinary personnel.
Porker Production.
“Mr.”: L. A. Downey, Victorian De-
partment of Agriculture’s pig expert, ex-
pects that the changeover from bacon
to pork production following reopening
of the Australian pork trade will call
for some changes in breeding stock and
the exercise of some caution.
Those large sows and boars used for
producing prime, lean baconers of 1801 b.
carcass weight won’t do as producers of
801 b. porkers, but the use of extremely
small-type breeding stock may also have
disadvantages leading to the production
of a type of porker that fattens to ex-
cess. Pork-eaters like a pork chop with
of back fat and about 2in. of lean
beneath it, and such chops come from a
pig tending to leanness rather than over-
fatness.
Full feeding from the time the pigs
come to the trough at three weeks of age
until they are marketed is a big factor in
the production of prime porkers, but
breeding from the right type of animal
to suit the feeding is equally as im-
portant.
Forage for Storage.

every winter finds dairymen in Central
Queensland worrying about starving

cattle. Sorghum and cowpeas are ridi-
culously easy to grow during the summer
months and, in combination, make a very
nourishing silage. The sorghum provides
carbohydrates, the cowpeas protein and
both crops contain vitamins and minerals.
The dwarf sorghums are unsuitable for
forage, so grow ’ either saccaline or
imphee. It doesn’t matter what the
variety of cowpea, but giant cowpea is
likely to yield more succulent green stuff
than any other species. There is little
doubt that cowpeas could be made into
a kind of hay like peanut vines.
Queensland Agricultural Department
has been trying hard lately to educate
dairymen generally to prepare for lean
seasons, by making silage and hay. There
is no need to have special grasses with
which to make hay, for good results have
attended experiments in haymaking with
quite a few native grasses.
Constructing an efficient silo is ad-
mittedly a task demanding the expendi-
ture of both time and money, but when
it is built and functioning it gives the
farmer freedom from worry. And worry
knocks out a farmer much more rapidly
than hard work.
D.D.T. in Use.
“Prof”: The chemical is now being
made up in sprays, paints, dusts and,
mixed with superphosphate, as a soil
insecticide, all with equal success on a
susceptible range of insects.
House-flies, fleas, mosquitoes and other
pests commonly infesting buildings
quickly succumb after contact with
D.D.T.-treated surfaces. For this pur-
pose 4 p.c. emulsions of D.D.T, are
sprayed over all surfaces likely to be
visited by the pests at the rate of one pint
to 100 sq. ft. In experiments conducted
by the C.S.I.R. “flat oil” type paints con-
taining 3-4 p.c. D.D.T. and enamels con-
taining 20 p.c. D.D.T. were found to be
equally effective for controlling flies.
Dogs and cats can be effectively deloused
by dusting with a 5 p.c. dust. Solutions
of D.D.T. in oils must on no account
be used on animals, as this type is liable
to be absorbed, resulting in poisoning and
sometimes death of the animal.
Some external parasites of poultry,
principally lice and fleas, can be controlled
by spraying sheds and roosts with D.D.T.
sprays and dusting the floor with the dry
chemical. Stickfast fleas attached to the
wattles and combs of poultry can be killed
by spraying affected birds with half to
one p.c. D.D.T, emulsion.
In the orchard sprays of 0.1 p.c.
D.D.T, solvent naphtha emulsions are
usually used. This is effective against the
black and the green peach aphids, the
Oriental peach moth and the pear slug.
It is also effective against the codlin moth
but, owing to the increased infestation of
various mites and woolly aphis, which are
unaffected by the spray, the treatment is
not recommended for apple-trees.
A wide range of vegetable pests is sus-
ceptible to treatments of D.D.T., either as
sprays of 0.05-0.10 p.c. emulsions or as
1-5 p.c. dusts. Some of the insects con-
trolled are green vegetable bug, bean and
potato aphids, potato moth, cabbage
centre grubs, cabbage moth and butterfly,
cut worms, red-legged earth mite and cur-
culio beetle. D.D.T. is ineffective against
the scale insects, cabbage and woolly
aphids, bean thrips, holy cross bugs, red
spiders and lucerne flea. Unfortunately
bees are affected by the wet spray, so
spraying should not be done while plants
are in flower. Various species of ants can
be controlled by dusting cupboards, floors
and nests with a 5 p.c. dust.
Hints for the Farm.
“Sundowner”: For the average merino
2j\h. of dry matter per day is an ideal
ration. If there is none in the paddock
chaff should be fed. There is more
nutriment in of good oaten chaff
than is necessary for a sheep’s mainten-
ance. If there is roughage in the pad-
dock of chaff per day is sufficient;
for a ewe in lamb, l|lb. to 21b.
“West”; Black scours in sheep is not
a specific symptom of black-scour worms
(B. 8/1 / ’47). It can mean coccidiosis, a
disease caused by minute parasites which
invade and destroy the cells lining the
intestine. As with black-scour worms,
only young sheep are affected. No
economic treatment is known.
“W. Court”; When mosquitoes are
bad, horses appreciate a smoke fire. Build
it with small, dry wood against a log or
stump ; cover with damp chips when it’s
burning well, and finally smother with
dry horse-dung; the “smudge” should
burn for hours. Don’t light fires if the
nags are rugged. Rugs are easily ignited
by sparks. .
“Billjim”: Barley grown on wheat
land is detrimental to the following wheat
crop. Fallow between two cereal crops
is a cardinal rule. If another crop must
be grown at once, try peas. Barley gets
a lot of its plant food from the immediate
surface and sends few roots down as
deep as oats and wheat.
“Johnny”: Many of the sorghums are
poisonous at certain stages to cattle. A
reliable home remedy is a drench of six
parts water to one part molasses. Give
each animal from a half to a gallon of
this mixture as soon as possible after
symptoms are noticed.
“Prof.”; Seeds are usually obtained
from such fruits as tomatoes, cucumber,
marrow, etc., by allowing the pulp to
ferment in water. This results in a poor
sample, takes ‘a considerable time and
cannot be done in cold weather. The
C.5.1.R.. has evolved an acid extraction
method which does away with all the
faults of the older method. The fruits
are pulped and large pieces of skin sieved
off. Then to every pound of pulp a cup
of water and four c.cs. of commercial
hydrochloric acid is added and the mass
thoroughly stirred. Allow to stand for a
half-hour, then wash seed in running
water and when thoroughly free of pulp
spread on bags to dry.
“E. 2”; We found kerosene emulsion
a good spray for aphis and cabbage
butterfly grubs which it kills on contact,
and weekly sprayings keep the plants
free of them. A piece of soap is boiled
in sufficient water to form a thin jelly
and about the same amount of kerosene
is stirred in thoroughly to emulsify the
mixture. Dilute in water for spraying.
“W.E.M.R.”; To stop the dog from
chasing cars, get a piece of wood about
Sin. long, bore a hole in the centre or
at balance point and suspend this with
about 4in. of wire or chain to the dog’s
collar. He will soon get sick of getting
his shins bumped when he races after a
car.
“Bill C.”: Even if you don’t prune
your citrus-trees never allow shoots to
develop up the-central stem. And if two
limbs rub against one another, remove
one, as the rubbing away of bark opens a
way for disease or pests. Borer-attack at
the end of the branches should never be
neglected or the pests will ultimately
spread to the larger branches and the
trunk. Small twigs may be sawn off
without the tree being spoiled. Make a
point of rotting down any prunings under
the parent tree, excepting big limbs, which
should be burned and the ash spread
about the trees.
“Sarina”: Let ,me head the rush to
correct my error on pumpkin hills (B.
15/l/’47). I should have said 3yds. or
9-10 ft. of space between hills and rows,
not 3ft., which would be far too close.
To cover the intervening space between
rows it is necessary to take the scuffler
up and down and across the field three
times. The cross-scuffling should be done
last, since it helps check soil erosion by
water

“Whoop” went the siren again, a deep-
toned, throaty blast demanding attention,
Mac was intent on rousing me out. I
put on my dark glasses and felt my way
out on to the verandah. s
It was a glorious morning, calm and
sunny. I could feel that. Moreover I
could hear it in the voices of the gulls,
You know that contented clucking sort
of sound they make on a perfect spring
morning when they’re at peace with the

The flood tide was running strongly. I
could hear it lap-lapping against the
dinghy moored just below me. In the
still morning air I could hear the thump-
ing of the ship’s propeller as she drew
abreast of me. There was something else.
too, a splashing sound. That meant her
propeller was half out of the water.
I COULD picture her then, in ballast,
1 riding high out of the water. Her
mate would have taken the opportunity
to get a bit of chipping and painting done
in her last port. There must be great
patches of redlead on her high slab sides,
Up for’ard the mate and a couple of
hands are standing by, and aft the second
mate had a couple more flaking down the
stern line.
On the lower deck a couple of firemen
are leaning over the rail, dirty cloth caps
pushed back on untidy heads, sweatrags
draped around grimy necks. One of
them is leisurely wiping the grease from
his forearm with a lump of cotton waste,
He lets it drop into the river and both
watch it go swirling aft. A figure in a
near-white cap and apron passes them
walking aft. Queer how wrong a man
walking aft on a passing ship looks, isn’t
it? He should be moving with his ship,
She’s right abreast of me now, and
Mac crosses the bridge and raises his
hand. I wave back in reply. He turns
and says something to the Master, who
raises his hand in half salute. I wave
back again, and presently feel my way
to a deckchair in the shade,
Of course I may have got that picture
all wrong, but I don’t think so. I know
I longed N to open one eye just for a
second or two to check up, but I knew
I’d suffer for it. She swept on up-river
to the wharves, and I felt the. offshore
breeze spring up.
Away in the distance the faint thump
of the propeller ceased abruptly. Pre-
sently I heard the clanking of cable as
the anchor went down. Mac would check
her with that and let the tide swing her
on it till she came around wifhin easy
heaving lines throw of the wharf. A
simple manoeuvre. Mac was a damn good
pilot.
A long silence while I waited for the
clatter of the windlass as they heaved
her in. Instead I heard several short
shrill blasts on a whistle, Mac’s whistle,
followed shortly after by the putter of a
launch. Minutes later an angry voice
bellowed through a megaphone some-
firing about “bloody line ashore.”
The breeze was freshening. Mac was
getting wild. Without opening my eyes
1 could see it all. Mac had dropped his
anchor too far out, probably afraid the
strong run of tide would swing his stern
agamst the wharf, and now the breeze,
pressing against her high sides, was hold-
ing his ship off.
The tide would be slackening, too. The
longer they delayed getting a line ashore
the further her stern would be blown
off. More whistles, more shouting while
I cwpaled in imnatipnrp

BY the time he arrived at my place
my bad spell was over and, with
the protection of an eye-shade and a

beer and glasses on the table,
“A hell of a mess you made of that
berthing,” I remarked, filling the glasses.
“Call yourself a pilot?”
Mac grinned ruefully. “A pretty poor
show all right,” he admitted. “Here’s
luck.”
And then, as the beir revived him, he
shifted from defence to attack,

Some Anxious Moments.
“ ‘There were never before in the world such
truly free and democratic elections,’ Mr. Stalin
told Russians before they began voting fqr rep-
resentatives to the Supreme Soviets. Mr. Stalin
himself was candidate for the Stalin district of
Moscow, His name was the only one on the
ballot paper. Pencils were provided in the
booths so that voters who wished could cross
out Stalin’s name, which would indicate a vote
against him. Later Moscow Radio announced
that there had been a 100 p.c. vote cast for
Mr. Stalin.” — “S.M.H.”
Polling Day—that extra happy day in
the lives of the happy dwellers in the
Workers’ Paradise, for all days there
.under the benign rule of the Politburo
were happy ones —had dawned. It had
only just dawned. In fact, the emanci-
pated proletariat hadn’t even had time
to chop up the goat’s-milk which was
poured by the milkman on the front
step, where it immediately froze into a
solid hunk (milk jugs were banned as
capitalist), before the peremptory rattle of
rifle butts on doors and the barking of
orders proclaimed the summoning of
voters to their free, unfettered privilege
of recording their choice of candidates.
The proletariat were allowed three
minutes to dress and be on the street,
ready to march. Shortly, snug against
the 58 degrees of frost in their standard-
cut processed-dockweed overcoats and
with their feet wrapped in American
Lease-Lend sandbags, the enfranchised
citizens moved off, armed guards evqry
few yards on each side of the column.
Outside the booths in Red Square those
at the head of the queue were lined up
—the tail of the queue was somewhere
on the other side of the city—and loud-
speakers began giving a recorded speech
by Joe, the main burden of which was
the phenomenal luck of Soviet citizens
in not having been born in countries
where they would have been condemned
to slavery under Western capitalism.
After that they were put through
another hour of Marxist catechism by
an army of political agents. Then came
an inspection of party cards and union
tickets by the N.K.V.D. Finally, before
voters were allowed to enter the booths,
the party collectors got on the job: 50
roubles to vote, plus 100 roubles amuse-
ment tax, plus a special 20-rouble levy
for the extension of espionage work at
Soviet embassies. The only persons exempt
from payment were Red Army officers
and party officials and their favorite
ballerinas, who voted in carpeted booths
specially built for them by the workers.
There was only one incident at the Red
Square booths which threatened to mar
this perfect example of the free exercise
of true democratic rights. A young
soldier, just returned from Berlin, where
he,had had some brief contact with the
Anglo-American zone, on being taken
into the booth between the usual two
N.K.V.D. men, picked up the pencil in-
stead of dropping his voting-paper straight
into the box. He held up the brand-
fiew pencil.
“Could I get a pencil from another
booth, Comrade?”.he asked. “This one
has never been sharpened.”
“All the other pencils are brand-new
and unsharpened. Comrade,” came the
stem reply.
The vo{er against Joe pulled out a
pocketknife, but before he could begin
sharpening operations he was grabbed by
two armed men and marched away. A
few minutes later a volley rang out and
the late would-be exerciser of the sacred
Soviet democratic right of free franchise
was lying at the base of a high wall,
his chest resembling a colander.
Meanwhile, at the other side of Red
Square, the little Fiihrer of the Kremlin
sat in his office, his face reflecting a very
agony of suspense. By the time the
booths hhd closed he had bitten through
five pipe-stems and all his nails were
chewed down to the quicks. At length,
five minutes after the last vote had been
cast, a high party official entered with a
paper in his hand and genuflexed low
before the Presence.
“H-how did I get on?” asked Joe, his
face in a njuck sweat. He took a dipper-
ful of vodka as a steadier.
The party official clicked his heels,
raised his hand in the clenched-fist salute,
chanted “Heilski, Fiihrer,” then said:
“You were accorded a one hundred per
cent, vote. Comrade.”
Joe leaped up, his face livid with anger.
“Only a hundred per cent,! ” he squeaked.
“I got that last time. ‘To stand still,’ as
Lenin said, ‘is to go back.’ I was expect-
ing at least a hundred and twenty per
cent, this time. Announce to the prole-
tariat dogs that the working week will
ip future be sixty-eight hours instead of
sixty!”

THE OTHER FELLOW'S MIND
The contributor placed first is paid
4|d. per line; all others 2\A. per line.
T.B.
Scoring off Government departments
might be one way pf getting into print,
but “Pawang’s” groan about compulsory
chest X-ray (B. 5/2/’47) would be laugh-
able were it not dangerous.
The claim that most of a civilised com-
munity contract t.b. in some form, but
the majority get over it without knowing,
is rather vague. It is used as a cheer-up
measure when a new t.b. victim is being
acquainted with his condition. The story
comes from a report of a series of post-
mortem examinations which showed that
about 96 per cent, revealed lung-scars
thought to be of t.b. origin.
The tubercle bacillus—with which I am
acquainted more than I care to admit —
is a tenacious organism that, once en-
trenched in human lung tissues, is almost
impossible to eradicate. Sanatorium
treatment can often shut off activity by
assisting the growth of calcium or scar
tissue around the infected area, but the
success of this is largely due to the
chemical makeup of the patient. In
almost every case it lepes a degree of
disability. As far as carrying on and
letting the disease pass of its own accord,
this has been tried by many—to their
relatives’ sorrow.
Any person showing radiological evi-
dence of active t.b. is a menace to the
rest of society until he receives treatment
and training in conduct. Hence it is the
duty of every Government to discover
these victims and do what it can for
them.
Finally, the idea of compulsory chest
X-ray is not one of “Labor’s” regimen-
tation whims. It is the policy of medical
scientists in every corner of the globe.
America’s scheme is already well under
way, and it is to he hoped that before
long Australia will be in a position to
kick along;— Ad Rem (Vic.).
Housing in Victoria
The housing position, as it affects
country areas, is even worse than in the
city. Victoria’s Housing Commission is
making commendable effgrts to relieve
the situation by extending its activities to
all the larger provincial towns, but de-
serves criticism of its method of allocat-
ing completed homes. Employees of
firms setting up factories in towns are
given preference over ex-servicemen.
While appreciating the fillip an indus-
try in the country provides, as well as
its aid to decentralisation, residents feel
that the Commission should make avail-
able a greater proportion of homes to re-
turned men. — Plain Australian (Vic.),
Defence of Squatters
On the coast west of Port Adelaide,
is Fort Glanville —an ancient pile whose
muzzle-loading guns were obsolete shortly
after the Crimean War. The Army had
never used the fort except as a detention
camp. Homeless folk recently moved in
and established themselves in what had
been the officers’ quarters, the magazines
and garrison barracks. They were will-
ing to pay a reasonable rent.
A few weeks ago a senior officer gave
them notice to quit. The Army Minister
issued instructions that the people were
to be left in possession.
The Army Minister should now ap-
point a civilian commission to survey the
available buildings and to insist that
all that can be spared be made avail-
able for temporary housing. I’d will-
ingly serve in such a capacity, and per-
haps be able to put my inside know-
ledge to good account. —Ex-R.S.M.
(S.A.). __
Accommodation in Brisbane
It is a problem worse than acute.
Hundreds of girls, many of them ex-
service, are living from day to day in
temporary accommodation with no pros-
pect of getting anything permanent.
Hundreds more cannot come to the city
at all, and are thus forced to give up a
unique opportunity for training in their
chosen field. And yet all round us is
ample accommodation, suitable at that,
going to waste.
As service personnel these girls spent
happy and comfortable years in the huts
I refer to. Why can’t these huts be
turned into first-class hostel accommoda-
tion? Surely there can be found ex-
service officers willing to act as matrons.
Many cooks and orderlies would be will-
ing to continue their jobs on a civilian
basis—fully-equipped laundries, dining-
rooms, sewing machines, wireless sets
and libraries are already there. Rejuven-
ating the huts with fresh paint, gay cur-
tains and bedspreads should not present
any very great problem. The army had
no difficulty in obtaining all its require-
ments during the war.
Each girl would have to be allowed
considerably more space than in her
army days to cope with her civilian
wardrobe. But even if this meant halv-
ing the number of girls catered for the
improvement in the present situation
would be enormous. Costs could be
worked out and the girls charged enough
to cover these. And, of course, suitable
relaxation of army discipline would be

P.-0.-w. on the Cousens Case
To “Ek Bum’s” article “The Cousens
Case Again” (B. 29/1/’47) more should
be added by one who had first-hand
knowledge.
It was not our fault that we were forced
to obey Jap orders. We complained
bitterly to our officers and sought guid-
ance and were told that nothing could
be done. Driven by rods, we carried
our many burdens along this road of
“collaboration,” fearing a little that we
had not been completely protected against
a future slur on our reputation as mem-
bers of the A.I.F. We did our utmost,
through sabotage, slacking and in a
hundred ways, to hinder the enemy’s war
effort.
At one time the Jap, calculating our.
use to him, demanded that the occupa-
tions of all prisoners be listed. They had
elaborate but comprehensive question-
naires for personal reply, and they were
not deceived when they learned that our
battalion consisted solely of “squatters,”
“pole-sitters,” “lion-tamers,” “criminals,”
“actors” and “professional soldiers.” We
left them helpless to force their pur-
pose, but had we answered correctly then
as truck-drivers, mechanics, engineers or
technicians we could be now accused of
voluntary collaboration.
“Ek Bum” says there were cases of
collaboration reported from prison camps.
We saw none at Ambon and Haisho.
As a radio announcer, Major Cousens
was -forced to work for the Japanese. His
big disadvantage was that they knew his
occupation, and the unsavory business of
using Jap witnesses at the Cousens trial
—heroes to newspapers, but typically
objectionable Japs —is particularly
nauseating to those who felt their hate
for interminable years.— Sgt. Damocles
(Vic.).
Colonel McCormick
I was at an officers’ club in
New York when the Colonel pub-
lished one of his attacks on Aus-
tralia. I had read the screed just before
going into dine and gave vent to my
feelings in the hearing of U.S. officers.
They said “Oh, you don’t want to take
any notice of that guy—he don’t cut any
ice over here.”
One of these officers handed me a
weekly with the remark, “Read that article
and see what we think of McCormick.”
The screed was written by a reporter who
went to Chicago specially to interview
the Colonel. Not being able to get into
the armor-protected h.q., he wrote an
interview after talking to a wide range
of employees of the man he went to see.
He stripped the blustering Chicago
“Tribune” proprietor to the bone, restored
my digestion to normal, and allowed
me to continue a happy meal.
The “Tribune” is little read beyond
Chicago, and the greatest service reporters
in America could render the rest of the
world is never to quote any statement
of McCormick’s in a dispatch to overseas
countries. Silence would touch his
exorbitant vanity more than anything else.
—Recco (N.S.W.).
“Publicity”
In the Brisbane “Courier-Mail”
(30/1/’47) them was a photograph of an
armed sentry at Victoria Barracks, put
there to keep Communist-led squatters
from invading the W.A.A.A.F. reserve.
The significant thing' about that picture
was that the sentry had his hand spread
over his face. He was on his lawful duty ;
he was supposed to be protecting Gov-
ernment property and he wished to re-
main unknown. Was it modesty or fear
of becoming a marked man? Had on£ of
the squatting comrades, been on hand the
photographer would have had a job to
dodge him.
That was evident a few days later when
a band of Communists paraded at Wool-
loongabba. Their slogans were silly;
their reasoning worse. When a policeman
commenced to take names, would-be
martyrs queued up for publicity. When
a photographer appeared he had to sort
them out to avoid a massed group,—
H.G.L. (Q.).
Pearling
Many people have the notion that the
pearling industry of North Westralia was
virtually exhausted through the pre-war
activities of the Japanese, Malayans and
others. This is not the case.
Like other forms of sea life, the oyster
spawn replaces depredations, and ocean
currents uncover fresh fields. In some
instances the pearl-oysters have remained
undetected for years, even though the
fCet of many divers have passed over
them. On record is the case of a fleet of
11 luggers operating together off the coast
north of Roebuck Bay for a period of
six weeks. They had gathered shell in
large quantities when they sighted a lone
lugger. Its skipper was permitted to join
the party, and in less than an hour he
had a “prize”—a shell containing a pearl
which ultimately sold for over £900.,
Actually the luggers do not seek for pearls
so much as for the shell.
The industry can still be profitable.
Cessation of operations through the war
period has allowed for replacement of the
beds. Diving methods have improved,
and the inventive minds of Diggers could
doubtless devise even better methods of
lifting the valuable harvest waiting to be
picked up. It is most certain that others
will come along and do the job if Aus-
tralians do not take it on.—C. Turner
(N.S.W.).
The King’s School
I was at the Parramatta meeting at
which a large number of ratepayers and
many Old Boys of The King’s School
carried a resolution declaring that the
school, which dates from 1831, should
be permanently established within or
near its present location.
The meeting was pretty well unani-
mous on the point that the proposal to
transfer the school to the neighborhood
of Wollongong (N.S.W.) was not in the
best interests of the institution or likely
to maintain its character and traditions.
It was pertinently recalled that the
N.S.W. Parliament had laid it down in
1893 that the properties should not be
sold or mortgaged, except to acquire
other land within the Parramatta police
district or to erect permanent buildings
on land owned by the school. The sug-
gestion was made that the school should
be rebuilt somewhere in one of the areas
about Baulkham Hills, Castle Hill or
Seven Hills. One of these sites is three
times as large as the one at Wollongong,
twice its height above sea-level and pur-
chasable at half the price. And it was
mentioned that if the school went else-
where it might have to abandon the dis-
tinctive and picturesque uniform which
the boys at present wear —an idea that
didn’t appeal to the sentiments of the
meeting.
There were cases during the war when
wearers of the A.I.F. uniform itself were
insulted on that score by hoodlums. And
the prospect of exposing boys from “The
King’s” to the objurgations, threats and
assaults of Communist larrikins is one
that distinctly please.— T. Corn-
stalk (N.S.W.).
Area Schools
Comments from two States:
Modelled on English ideas (B. 29/l/’47),
these schools actually followed closely the
methods of the Kingsley Fairbridge school at
Pinjarra (W.A.). At one stage, in fact, the
" You'll have to come back next year—your suit's not ready yet."
name Fairbridge Farm Schools was suggested
Wrondv because the set-up of me area
behoof departs from that of the Fambrxdge
school in being much more elaborate, and the
primary aim it, of course, different Pmjarra
SSd as a school and home for young
Empire immigrants. .
The American scheme of closing smaller
schools and conveying children from small
districts to the area, schools has now been
adopted. This is, in some respects, a weak
spot. While to travel some miles every day
into a bigger community centre for their
education may be all right for older children,
it isn’t so good for infants to spend a whole
long day away from their homes and home
districts. Besides, the system of closing small
schools to concentrate on the one large school
is a form of centralisation which, looked at
from some angles, is a step backwards. If we
are on the doorstep of the atomic age any sort
of centralisation should be avoided.
We are told by educational authorities that
the big community school will give better teach-
ing; but why should it? There is nothing
better than good individual teaching in a small
school. If the best student-teachers were sent
for their final year, as part of their training,
to small country schools, those schools would
be kept up to date and the young teachers
would be on their mettle to give good service.
Meanwhile, in modern educational methods
England is forging ahead of us again. Her
most modern experiments are teaching boys
the driving and handling of cars, motor-cycles
and planes, and teaching girls the entire run-
ning of a flat or household. Australian edu-
cational thought is slow-geared for the times.
Soon, if yve don’t accelerate, our area school
system will be static, if not completely out-
moded.—Jane Edwards (Tas.). .
“T.W.’s” party of experts Aay have been
“deeply impressed,” but at least one party of
qualified observers visiting similar schools in
another State reacted differently. Having wit-
nessed the type of curricular activity lauded
by “T.W.,” they asked the very pertinent
question—“ But where does the mental effort
come in?” • , .
In these days of a tardily-awakening public
interest in education, Governments are aware
that the public likes to see something for its
money. Parents are happy if they can see
their children doing “something useful” at
school, and they will lend cheerful support to
the headmaster whose curriculum provides for
such work. Kudos for the Government which
establishes such schools is purely by the way.
Pig-raising, fencing, poultry-keeping, canteen-
running, etc., all impress those who do not
look for more significant achievements.
For most people, knowing little or nothing
of the deeper issues which mush determine aims
in education, still conceive of schooling as,
above all else, a matter of the gaining of the
knowledge and skills required for the process
of earning a livelihood. So the oft-heard cry
is; Why teach history? Why geometry? Why
foreign languages? Teach them something
useful instead.
Yet the business of earning a living—and ot
doing “useful” manual jobs—is only a part
of life; and schooling should be, above all,
a preparation for life as a whole. Let the
prime purpose of the school, therefore, be the
inculcation of the habit of clear thinking and
the acquirement by the youngsters of knowledge
which will admit of their becoming citizens
interested in intellectual matters, and capable
of forming soundly-reasoned opinions. After
all, a self-reasoning public is Requirement No. 1
for the successful functioning of the democratic
principle. , , , .
It must not be overlooked that the school
day is a short one —and there is a definite
limit to the amount that may be crammed
into a given time. And “T.W.’s” cookery,
laundry, vegetable gardening, etc., used to be
taught in the home, without any interruption
of school work. . „
Of course, youngsters enjoy this practical
work; it demands so little of the old-fashioned
mental slogging. Yet, during the last decade
the whittling away of the “core ot sohfl
mental work of the curriculum has been a
steady and continuous process. Even univer-
sities have debased their matriculation jequire;
mentg. Apart from the long list of “useful
subjects given by “T.W.,” schools have be-
come agencies for ration-book distribution,
savings-bank business, conduct of chanty
appeals, entertainment of parents, raising of
funds to purchase equipment and distribution
of milk. Teachers organise, direct and control
the aforementioned extracurricular activities
and write up intricate returns concerning them.
They act as booksellers; they repair broken
locks, desks and lavatory cisterns; they write
attendance —and a host of other —returns; they
record examination results numerically ano
alphabetically and many times over. Where-
and when —in the course of the short school
day does the “core” of mental work for tne
youngsters come in? .
Let’s can a halt. Raise the leaving age to
16; concentrate upon the “core” until tne
youngster is, say,. 14, and let him tacU-
vocational training when he has acquired m
intellectual equipment, plus the habit otJ“ -
telligent reading and thinking, to work up° ;
We can’t afford it? Australia’s
gambling bill is approximately £lOO mmion-
its liquor bill £4O million; its education bin-'
£l3 million.— Wombat (S.A.).


Inns and Pubs
In the horse and bullock days the way-
side inn was popular and profitable.
When the car came these inns were gradu-
ally delicensed, and a batch of public-
houses, all in fierce competition, tsprang
into being in the larger towns. Now,
however, there is no competition. The
large town pub is able to dictate to the
travelling public what it shall or shall not
drink and where or not it shall lay its
weary head.
It is a time for revival of the country
inn. Licenses might be given to reput-
able men with comfortable farmhouses
and the means of providing car camps.
The Americans have perfected this
“motel” system—a number of single
rooms and a car shelter attached. A
fireplace, bunks and shower provide the
necessities and the traveller does his own
chores.
In Maoriland I have gratefully taken
comfortable refuge in camps of this
nature. Why not have them on long
hops between our far-flung capital cities?
—J. C. B. (Vic.).
In our town there are four hotels with
only a sprinkling of guests. Accommo-
dation is called for almost daily and
cannot be obtained. Stirely empty beds
should not be allowed to remain empty.
Drinking and the facilities for it are
such that no one would consider taking
a lady into the so-called lounges for re-
freshments.
Worst of all, the worker whose spend-
ing makes the proprietor wealthy often
finds himself in the saloon, paying the
corresponding prices. Otherwise, he gets
no beer.
There is a crying need for a strong
move to control the hotelkeeper and
force him by heavy fines, imprisonment
or cancellation of his licence to place
his business on the prescribed footing,
rendering services to the public.—C.‘ B. M.

Unbelievers
“Herbert Dawson” (B. 29/I/’47) advo-
cates freedom of the air for teaching
atheism, and unintentionally gives us a
sample of the propaganda we might ex-
pect. According to “H.D.” the recent
global war was the work of “a Christian
world.” He evidently classes Hitler,
Musso and Hirohito as Christians. To
blame Christianity for the Nazi and
Japanese atrocities is not truth, but a libel
worthy of Goebbels himself.
J‘H.D.” says “Leave the suppression of
speech and thought to Russia, which has
something to hide.” But as Russia is a
nation of unbelievers and should
therefore be a paragon of truth and
tolerance, free from the superstitions and
hates of Christianity, how did she
get mixed up in a war supposedly
reserved for Christians only? If “H.D.”
re-reads his par he will see that he has
proved the atheist sixth of the world to
be the most intolerant segment of that
world and with the most to conceal. If
his logic and “truth” are representative of
unbelief then give me good old ignorant
superstition leavened with lofty ideals
and a certain respect for current histori-
cal facts. — Freethinker (S.A.).
Widows and Pensions
Political Points (B. 18 /12/ ’46) is right
as regards “scandal” and “scandal-mon-
ger,ing” being words not mentioned in
the Bible, but surely the following from
the King James version, Timothy I,
chap. 5, verse 13, runs very close to the
same meaning:
And withal they [the reference in pre-
ceding verses is to young. widows] learn to
be idle wandering about from house to
house, and not only idle but tattlers also
and busybodies, speaking things which they
ought not.
I wonder how the widow’s pension
(no age or child limit) has affected the
gossip output. Ido know that with its
advent a certain fine class of widow has
gone into oblivion. Two of the type,
who live near me, formerly worked for
their families with not one pennf of
child endowment or any other Govern-
ment help. Reared in the atmosphere of
“Life is real; life is earnest,” their chil-
dren not only kept up with their fellows,
but surpassed them in adult life.
Further proof of what the Scotch pro-
claim when on the number
of Scottish business heads in other
countries: “A dash of frugality and
self-reliance in a youngster’s upbringing
pays unco’ guid dividends.” — Wotcher

Lotteries and Nurses
In B. 5/2/’47 there was a cartoon
depicting Australian nurses leaving this
country for South Africa and better con-
ditions. The whole question of nurses’
pay and conditions is particularly interest-
ing to N.S.W. people, as we have a
flourishing lottery that was instituted on
behalf of the hospitals—or was it? Gross
profits of the N.S.W. Government lottery
are just under £20,000 per week, and if
to this there were added the usual Govern-
ment subsidy (payable before the in-
auguration of lotteries), the hospitals
should be in a position to accommodate .
all patients needing treatment and pay all
nurses decently.
One wonders why these women are
not better paid and provided for, con-
sidering these circumstances. Taxed

The New G.-G.
Our G.-G. designate appears in a
photograph on the front page of my
morning paper returning a salute from
the constable on duty at the gates of
Admiralty House, Sydney. His effort
appears to be a combination of Boy
Scout and naval salutes; Mr. McKell,
having been a non-starter in military
affairs, could not be expected to know-
that an officer in mufti returns a salute
by raising his lid, not tipping it. He has
one finger over his right eye, another is
crooked, and the thumb is below his chin.
The more I examine the photo., the
more I’m convinced it is really a pub-
licity still of late film actor Hugh Her-
bert giving out his “Woo-woo!” — Ken

Bretton Woods
That citadel of sane democracy the
British House of Commons offers an
example to Australians of the way in
which the British people at large are
taken into the confidence of the Govern-
ment on questions of vital national con-
cern.
On December 12, 1945, the Chan-
cellor of the Exchequer brought before
Parliament the Bretton Woods Agree-
ment. He explained the purposes and
obligations of the proposals ; he weighed
the pros and cong, concealing and extenu-
ating nothing touching the risks to be
faced from the British point of view;
he pointed to the solid gains assured.
And Dr. Dalton laid stress on the pro-
viso that any .member-nation was free
to withdraw without penalty immedi-
ately on giving notice and to get its sub-
scription back. But gravely he warned
the House that rejection of the agree-
ments meant the end of all hope of
Anglo-American co-operation “in this
dangerous new world.” Bluntly he asked
“If you reject it, what is your alterna-
tive?”
How different Westminster’s opposite
number in Canberra? The House by-
passed ; the Prime Minister and his sup-
porters left high and dry by a pressure
group in a party which has only a 0.4
p.c. majority of the whole nation’s voting
strength ; crowing over the fact that there
is to be no A.L.P. conference to “decide
the policy.”
Obviously a new name is overdue for
this travesty of Democracy. M. B.
(N.S.W.).
The Murray
I knew the old river when its banks,
from far up on the Darling and the Mur-
rumbidgee to Mannum near the mouth,
were lined with a practically unbroken
avenue of giant redgums. Visiting the
lower reaches after 25 years, I was
appalled at the devastation.
For mile after mile the magnificent old
redgums are dead or dying. Locking
is the cause. The redgum can stand
being flooded for a time, but having
water high on its trunk all the year round
kills it.
A few years ago somebody put a few
plants of the water hyacinth into the
Ramco lagoon to beautify it. The
hyacinth soon filled the lagoon and then
spread into the main channel. In other
parts of the world,.and in Australia, also,
this pest has choked rivers, turn-
ing their channels into stagnant swamps
filled with foul-smelling’ water, killing
off all fish and ruining irrigation settle-
ments. The Department of Agriculture
took prompt action and the danger may
have been averted.
In the Murray cod we had one of the
finest fresh-water food fish in the world,
but somebody had to let the useless Euro-
pean carp loose in the river. Not con-
tent with that, somebody else introduced
the voracious English perch, with the
tench as a sideline. Today the cod is
going—fast.
Some of these things, like the dying
of the redgums, is the price we must
pay for progress. Locking had to be
done to make the irrigation settlements
possible. But we sorely need a Murray
Valley Authority, free to operate as it
sees fit without being fettered by inter-
state rivalries, and run as a division of
that institution whose work is above
criticism —the C.S.I.R. . Such a body
could set out to make good the damage,
wherever possible.
At little expense, banks could be
clothed with willows to take the place
of the dead redgums. It should also be
possible to plant other trees around the
swamps and - backwaters, as part of our
reafforestation policy; trees which will
grow under Murray swamp conditions
and whose softwood timber would have
“You win, Dulcie — I COULD, touch bottom!”
a commercial value. The swamp-pine of
Florida suggests itself as one of them.
It may still be possible to save the
Murray cod by spending a sum equal to
that now spent on rearing young trout.
A lot of preliminary work has been done ;
it has already been established that the
young cod can be reared under hatchery
conditions, but it needs deep water —
25ft. or more—in which to live while at
the minnow stage. That is no insuper-
able difficulty.
And there are scores of places
along the river where tourist camps
could be established, with swamp-pines
and willows for shade and a grass such
as Kikuyu tq form a natural lawn on
the ground and keep down the “bulldust”
which forms when Murray bank soils are
cut up by traffic.
Wild rice sown on swamps would pro-
vide food for wild’ducks. Here we could
copy what was done by “Ducks Un-
limited” in Canada. This syndicate,
formed mainly by sportsmen, did more
to enable wild ducks to breed than all
the work of the bird-protection cranks
had accomplished, and increased the
numbers of the birds by millions within
a few years.
Our Old Man River could be beauti-
fied out of all knowledge and at the
same time could be made to provide far
more wealth, at a fraction of the cost
needed for crack-brained schemes such
as that of diverting North Queensland
coastal rivers into the dry interior. There’s
no risk at all with the Murray. Every-
thing we’ve done with it to date has paid.
—Bogaduck (S.A.).
Noise
Every now and then there’s a burst
of noise about noises. People write to
papers and complain about howling
dogs, deafening wireless sets, etc. One
noise which hasn’t been mentioned is that
made by those drills the road-workers
have to use. Science is pretty good at
measuring and describing and otherwise
knowing all about Sound, but why can’t
it produce some kind of silencer for
these drills? The stores outside which the
drills have their regular exercise are run
by human beings, not machines, and the
effect on nervous systems can, after
a few days, be disastrous. I’ve no idea
what could be done to make the drills
quieter, but it’d be encouraging in an
already-noisy city if we knew scientists
were at least thinking about it. Eve
Merritt (N.S.W.).
Lift Accidents
Two fatal lift accidents in the course
of a few days, one in Sydney and one in
Melbourne, emphasise the importance
of the simple notice posted in almost
every lift in N. S. Wales. It says that
ho person, other than the one at the
time operating the lift, shall interfere
with the machinery or the controlling
mechanism, or any gate, door or fasten-
ing. That’s good advice, but how many
people have read those few lines?
Lift regulations should stipulate that
simple safety measures be printed in
large type and placed in all lifts. In 16
- years as a liftdriver I’ve never had
trouble getting maintenance assistance
when needed in a hurry. A friend had
the nasty experience of being unable to
get out of a passenger lift for a couple
of hours, but a cleaner managed to pass
him a stick of wood through and he was
out. The top cam of the outside door
had become stuck and it only needed
the stick to do the trick.
That’s worth remembering. All owners
of buildings where passenger lifts are in-
stalled, particularly where the lifts are
running late into the night, should place
a high stool or chair and a 3ft. stick in
every lift.
The most important safety point,
though, is to look for a “stop” button,
or a safety “stop run” switch, before
attempting to escape. They cut the power
off completely, niffi any attempt to
escape can then be made in reasonable
safety.
But the best advice of all to anyone
caught in a lift is stay put and yell for
help, or curl up and snooze until help
arrives.— Van (N.S.W.).
Municipal Officers
Now that controls are being lifted,
municipal officers are breathing again.
They had a tough time during the war.
The treasurer of one provincial city was
secretary of the emergency transport com-
mittee. He was responsible for issuing
permits for tyres and liquid fuel. He
drew up plans for evacuating all children
to less vulnerable areas. He prepared
war-damage-insurance details. He had to
run tfle War Agricultural Committee and
the Loans Committee for a time, and had
to keep an eye on A.R.P. work and the
important Soldiers’ Welfare Committee.
In summer, danger of bushfires in hot
spells added the worry of supervising the
ban on gas-producers.
That treasurer, a 1914-18 Digger, also
acted as town clerk while the t.c. was
away with the R.A.A.F.
Some Government authority should
recognise in a tangible way the amount
of work done by municipal officers at
no expense to the country. They don’t
look for thanks, but few have had even
that. — Jam (Vic.).
The Doctor
Though some form of medical social
service is bound to come, the B.M.A.
and individual doctors still rant against
the suggestion. Though crying that it is
impracticable thfey fail to offer any better
proposals.
The health of the people should be the
first consideratipn, not the pocket of the
doctor. The medical profession will have
to realise that the old idea of the rich pay-
ing for the poor and the poor receiving
charity attendance from their medico has
to go. The fear of medical expenses to
the person of independent frame of mind
who hates charity keeps many people
from calling in the doctor until it is too
late for him to be of usfe. Social service
of medicine would avoid this.
The New Zealand scheme whereby
the patient selects his own doctor, pays
his fee and then presents the receipt to
the post office for refund has much to
recommend it. Surely our medical pro-
fession could produce a scheme to pro-
vide the service to the people and yet
allow doctors to retain their own initiative.
—Simple Simon (N.S.W.).
Compulsory Unionism
“Infanteer” (B. 15/1/’47) completely
disregards the. basic reason for compul-
sory unionism, which is that those who
receive the benefits of unionism should
do their share in the common cause by
being members of a union. .Even op-
ponents of Labor concede that workers
enjoy rights today which without union-
ism they would have never obtained ;
practically every benefit which unionists
possess has had to be fought for. Therein
lies a good deal of the bitterness and dis-
trust that today render so futile the
beautiful dream of “conciliation” and
arbitration.
“Infanteer” asks “Isn’t this a free
country?” It is ; but “freedom” does not
mean licence to do everything one
wants to do. The very idea of freedom
means that the rights of the community
must come first, and “freedom” must be
regulated for the community’s benefit
and not for the individual. Finally, “In-
fanteer” must remember that many
servicemen weri unionists. They are
now back in their trades, as vigorous as
ever in assertion of union rights.— Don
(Vic.).
