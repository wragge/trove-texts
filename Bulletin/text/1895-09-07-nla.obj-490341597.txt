A BIT EARLY, PERHAPS!
But Spring is already with us. Which means that the
SPRING FASHIONS ARE IN.
A fact so dear to every lady, whether she lives in the great Metropolis
or in the far West.
Ladies in the Country need not be at a loss to know what is going to be worn
this Spring, as Mark Foy’S Illustrated Catalogue will give them an excellent idea.

WEYMAN’S STORIES.
Stanley Weyman does not write hurriedly, yet
he writes too hurriedly for fame. His historical*
romances are the best that are done to-day, but
they will hardly live beyond to-morrow. The
killing pace of modern literature permits no man
to cater at once for posterity and for the pub-
lishers. A pity. Good name is so much better
than shekels—-and so very much less filling at
popular prices.
Here is the literary order of merit of Weyman’s
books:—
My Lady Rotha I
Under the Red Robe J- 1
A Gentleman of France I
Good
The Story of Francis Cludde Fair.
The Man in Black I
The House of the Wolf >-
The New Rector
-Tolerable.
Then there are two new stories, “ Memoirs of a
Minister,” due in Australia in Nov.; and “The
Red Cockade,” due about February.
Considering his output, Weyman keeps his level
well; and there is, indeed, a marked improvement
in the method and interest of his later books.
Between the trio,at the head of the list individual
taste must choose; their workmanship is very
even. Perhaps “My Lady Rotha,” which leaves
the more familiar French field to exploit the Ger-
man States during the Thirty Years’ War, shows
the best art. The plot is very ingeniously man-
aged.;, and its current flows with an ease which all
Oonan Doyle’s labour of learning cannot'achieve.
“ A Gentleman of France ” fits into the stirring
period of Henri Quatre. The idea is to make the
aero disclose his own character by the tale he
tells, and i;i its telling, without direct touches.
“ Under the Red Rote ” is and artisti-
-3a ly tetter. There is more restraint and propor-
" on ; and the incidents are not so crowded. Then
toe climax, if similar, is more dramatic. (Note
t is unknown who comes masked to rescue M. de
Jjcheforet. IsthisO.’s wife ? Apparently. Yet
iow account for her tallness and daring, as com-
■ ared with previous description of small, womanly
voman ? Mademoiselle is supposed to be the tail
-me—vide picture. And where did Madame get
swordsmanship, horsemanship ?)
Weyman’s best quality is his wonderful fresh-
i■ ss and fertility of invention. His worst defect
his lack of effective humor. His style is admir-
* >e; he manages the “ I ’’-narrative beautifully ;
■ e , with all his pains, his characters fail to hang
t one memory.
My Lady Rotha, Under the Red Robe, Gentle-
.i n of France, Francis Cludde—each, paper, 35.;
>th, 4s.
NOTES.
Another “colonial library” is in the field—
Blackwood’s. The best of the early volumes is
Dorothea Gerard’s “ Lady Baby ” (paper, 35.;
doth, 45.)
From “Old and New, ’’recently-published poems
by Ernest Radford :
I held her hand
To-day,
And whispered a word,
And she heard ;
And I did not work,
And she did not play,
To-day.
I touched her lips
To-night
And none knew, but we two,
The delight;
And I shall not sleep,
And she will not sleep,
To-night.
Now let any “man of feeling” forget those lines
if he can !
There is room for a good literary sneer (the
sneeriest and most aggravating of all sneers) in the
fact that the newly-knighted Walter Besant,
though originator and president of the English
“Authors’ Association” (for publishing books
without a middleman), has never yet issued a
book under its auspices. Yet he and others
are constantly railing against the injustice of
publishers. All Beaant’s books are issued
through Chatto and Wind us ; but can that firm,
under the circumstances, take the fact as a com-
pliment ?
Admirers of Balzac will welcome a complete
edition of his novels in English, piloted by that
pleasant essayist, George Saintsbury. The first
volume is “ The Wild Ass’s Skin ” (Le Beau de
Chagrin), 4s. Balzac is one of the few French
authors who bear translation well, and the
“ Comedie Humaine ” in cheap French, dress is a
trial to the eyes; So Emerson would certainly buy
this edition.
B. L. Farjeon’s “ Aaron the Jew ” is being
translated into Hebrew—-a rare distinction. One
only recalls “Daniel Deronda ” and Zangwill’s
“ Children of the Ghetto ” as similarly favored.
“East Lynne,” in the new edition (posted,
2s. (Id.) is the best-selling 2s. book the Australian
trade handles. Its total of about 390,000 copies
to date, however, is still a long way behind the
700,000 of “Pickwick ” (now obtainable in a good
cheap edition, posted, Is. Bd.). 700,000, also,
Marie Belloc claimed in June Englishwoman
for Max O’Rell’s “ John Bull and his Island” —
is there an exaggerating cipher ?
Frederick Locker-Larnpson, who died the other
day, made a most admirable collection of English
occasional verse, in “Lyra Elegantiarum ” (posted,
2s. 6d., in the excellent “ Minerva ” series). His
own poems are clever and dainty, but Jack fibre.

Periodicals.
SOME SELECTED MONTHLIES.
Cosmos, per annum, Bs.; single numbers, Bd.
(fis. and fid. within N.S.W.). This Australian
magazine, now nearly a year old, is recently
much improved.
Review of Reviews, single numbers, lid. ; per
annum, 11s. One may cavil at Stead’s fads,
and resent the perhaps inevitable dulness and
lateness and scrappiness of his clippings, but
on the whole his Review covers a large field
well and thoroughly.
Sokibnee’s Magazine, single numbers, Is. 2d.;
per annum, 14s. This and the R. of R. are
(with the Century) the only foreign maga-
zines which pay Australasia the compliment
of a special edition, Scribner’s has some-
thing of the attenuation of American culture,
but is always readable and very well illus-
trated.
The Windsor Magazine, per annum, lls.; single
numbers, lid. Popular pictures, stories, and
articles.
Contemporary Review, per annum, 40s.
Fortnightly Review, ~ 40s.
Nineteenth Century, „ 40s. Three
leading English reviews, solid and strong.
New Review, per annum, 18s. A happy medium
between heaviness and flippancy.
North American Review, per annum, 375.
The Forum, per annum, 375. The two best
American reviews.
NOTES.
The best story in “Scribner’s Magazine” for
August (Is. 2d.) is “The Scab”—which has real
thrill, though allowance must be made for the
point of view. Clever illustrations brighten an
article on “All Paris A-Wheel,” and E. A.
Abbey’s pastel pictures are brilliantly reproduced.
Anthony Hope’s story, “The Wheel of Love,”
is very ordinary—the author writes too much now-
adays to sparkle as he did in “The Dolly Dia-
logues ” (Is. 3d. ) —his masterpiece.
“Windsor Magazine ” for August (lid.) is a read-
able number, and this magazine altogether shows
considerable improvement on early issues. Let-
terpress and illustrations are of good, sound, popu-
lar quality.
“ The Album ” (per annum, 265. ; single copy,
Bd.) is unsurpassed for quality of illustrations
among English picture-journals. The work is all
photographic, and the reproductions are exceed-
ingly well done. Three recent numbers make a
specialty of views of Oxford, of the Grace cricket-
ing family, and of English opera singers.
“In Town” (per annum, Bs., single copy, Bd.)
is another clever picture-periodical, issued monthly,
and making a feature of colored illustrations.
The August number has a supplement of river
Thames views, and stories by E. W. Hornimg and
Fergus Hume.
There is keen competition between the cheap
American monthlies. The Cosmopolitan led a
reduction from the 25-cent standard to 15 cents ;
McClure’s followed; and Munsey’s dropped to 10
cents. To this low level (lid. posted; lls. per
annum) the Cosmopolitan now comes, and it is so
good for the money that one can’t see how the
dearer magazines will keep the prices up. Of
course, the circulation of all three named is over
the half-million ; and profit comes entifely from
the advertisers.

RECENT BOOKS.
in Henry Parkes’s “ Sonnets and Other Verse ”
2s. 9d.) strictly commonplace ideas find strictly
■ /mmonplace expression. Occasionally a glimpse
o? feeling brings an echo from better bards, but
i ' a rule the aged author stumps stiffly along on his
fwn crutch. At every step something in 14 lines
f ills shrieking and is trodden under foot. The
s quashed sonnet assumes strange shapes—let this
9» irreverently lifted from the mangled heap :
NAPOLEON BONAPARTE.
Tis just a hundred years since Bonaparte
Appeared in Paris. Then the bloody frenzy
Was dying out: men look’d for some Rienzi,
To master madness, heal the Nation’s heart,
3 till bleeding from its awful wounds. Apart,
And self-contained, through his own mystic lens he
Survey’d the chaos with its stifled frenzy
If mangled factions, left without a chart
)r guiding star. The Man of Destiny,
With his young strength untried, reined in and
tamed
The raging elements as steeds that do
Their riders’ bidding ; ever mounting high,
He vaulted on the whirlwind, and proclaimed
His gorgeous rule ! Then followed Waterloo !
Frenzy—Rienzi—lens he (fine effort, but exhaust-
ing)— encore frenzy ! O penultimates, O Petrarch !
“ Steeds that do their riders’ bidding ” is so good
—and so new; and the moral of the whole is so
original—and so dull. Yet Parkes’s morals are
really rather lively. Why doesn’t he publish
“ Smoking-Room and Other Stories ?”
Mathilde Blind’s monograph on “ George Eliot ”
(Is. fid.) is worth reading.
The biography of “ Sonia Kovalevsky,” a clever
Russian girl who became professor of mathematics
at Stockholm University, adds to one’s impression
of the originality and strength of the Slav brain.
Morrison’s “Australian in China” (lls. 3d.),
from which liberal quotation was made in a recent
Bulletin, is a very readable book of travel-impres-
sions, well-illustrated.

q XJ-RSELVEIB!
We wish Ik to be understood that the character of the
business we do, and the absolutely inclusive variety of the
goods we sell, entitle us to be called
UNIVERSAL PROVIDERS.
We are also not far out, considering the low prices we
ask for everything we sell, and the consequent blessings
we are continually showering upon the people, when we
assert not in timorous tones, but with the trumpet voice
of confidence in the truth of what we say, when we dub
ourselves puBLIC BENEFACTORS.
There are good men in every sphere of life—honest
citizens In every community, whose deeds stamp them
for the approval of their fellow-men, and single them out
from the common herd. Thus we find among the crowd
who aspire to serve their country on the benches of the
Legislative Assembly a patriot here and there who stands
out in bold relief against the majority, whose sole aim
is place and pay. And in commercial life the same thing
occurs, and the same strong contrast between the few
disinterested friends of the people, and the many selfish
lookers after the big profits they would like to make, is
plainly apparent. To the former class, to the little hand
of merchants who study their customers’ interests, and
who in self-abnegation and contentedness, are willing to
accept small profits in reward for their services, belong
ANTHONY HORDERN’S.
They say that a good action is its own reward, but if the
good action entail hard work, much tribulation, and con-
tinual strife, then surely the laborer is worthy of his hire,
and the doer of good actions entitled to some recompense
at the hands of those who profit by what he does.
ANTHONY HORDERN’S
nevereease from their toil; in the burden and heat of the
noonday sun they work, oppressed by the cruel frost of
smnewhile baffled efforts and frustrated negotiations, they
continue, knowing always that the approval of millions of
souls is theirs. For three-quarters of a century it has
been so, and for a longer time than that it will remain as
it has been. Generations passed away have bought from
the great house, and generations yet to come will do the
same. Like the practice of honesty or truth; there is a
policy in it which brings to its adherents

HOW BABIES SUFFER
From Torturing Humors
When their tender Skins are literally On Fire with Itching and
Burning Eczemas and other Itching, Scaly, and Blotchy Skin and
Scalp Diseases, none but mothers realize.
To know that a single application of the Cuticura Reme-
dies will, in the great majority of cases, afford instant and complete
relief, permit rest and sleep, and point
to a permanent and economical (because
so speedy) cure, and not to use them
without a moment’s delay, is to be guilty
of positive inhumanity. [No greater leg-
acy can be bestowed upon a child than
a skin without blemish and a body nour-
ished with pure blood.

ON THE ARROW-TRACK.
[FOR THE BULLENTIN.]
Coming from the Arrow, \
With my empty dray,
Met a nigger family
Tramping on the way ;
The meanest, poorest wretches
I had seen in W.A.
He led them from the Ninety-Mile,
That greasy, grey-haired black,
His wire-like legs kept well ahead
Along the ruddy track;
The mother had a strip of baric
Slung across her back.
A swaggy would have failed to keep
That skinny nigger’s pace ;
The gin beneath her burden’s weight
Was limping in the race,
Within its littered filth I saw
A picanninny’s face.
Trotted beside, another child,
And mostly clothed in air,
Who pointed to my water-bag—
I gave what I could spare,
And to the tailboard lifted her
And bade her ride up there.
She yabbered—but the mother seemed
Half proud and half afraid,
And kept close in beside the wheels
And watched me and the maid ;
Till I gave her half a damper
That a new-chum digger made.
I tried to add a little
To the little that I knew,
“ Gooyah, Gooyah,” meant the flies
That round about her flew,
And “ Yindi”—well—the finest teeth
That ever smiled on you !
And then she started singing—
But although attentively
I tried to pick up any air
Whatever air might be —
’Twas not what I had often heard
At the corroboree.
I nearly had it off by heart
And thought what I should say
When I should bring it back to Vic.,
This truly native lay—
But in a flash I recognised—
“ Ta-ra-ra Boom-dee-ay I”

CURRABUBULA.—AFTER KENDALL.
[For The Bulletin.]
Where the Everlasting moans
In the loneliness of dread,
Through the terror-haunted thrones
Of the kingdom of the dead.
There the thunder-stricken beams
Sapless, leafless, godless are—
Where the feeble little streams
Mumble—Currabubula !
In that soul-forbidding gloom
(God of mercy, mercy show !)
Dwells inevitable doom,
Mortals come, but phantoms go.
In the half-moon’s ghostly light,
Through the gorge a broken bar,
Waters flowing through the night
Moaning—Currabubula !
One secluded pheasant mocks
Twenty birds from one retreat.
Here a ramble through the rocks,
There a fall of fifty feet.
Gaining strength where torrents bend
Down the haunts of waratah.
Wailing loudly as they wend
Curra—currabubula!
Where we wandered long ago
(God of glory, glory take t)
And in unavailing woe
Sobbed as if our hearts would break.
When thy lips downcast and mute
Held the kiss to make or mar,
As the stream-sprite lapped his lute
With his Currabubula.
Where was coldness such as this T
Passion-frozen in the breath.
Bitter as a soundless kiss
Stolen from the lips of death.
And you dared to weep and live
While you dared deny to me
(God of vengeance, vengeance give I)
My immortal legacy.
Glistened there the poisoned fang
(God of pity, pity me I),
Circled there the boomerang
In the weird corroboree.
When we clamor loud in youth ;
God, why dost Thou hear our cries ?
Thou hast prescience for ruth ;
We are mortal, Thou art wise.
Solace comes in silent sleep ;
There repentance kneels no more;
There our sins no vigil keep
Oh the dark remorseful snore.
We may soar beyond in dreams,
Who in life may rise not far,
Far beyond where feeble streams
Mumble —Currabubula 1

JULIAN SAKE.
Two or three instances of criminal folly
are reported from western N.S.W. In one case a
wool-shed on a “free labour” station was fired ;
on another the engine to drive the shearing
machines was tampered with. One pretty certain
effect of such acts will be to defer the release of
even the more deserving of the men imprisoned
during last season.
Captain Morse, the popular commander of
the Alameda, is about to publish his reminis-
cences, under the title, “50 Years of a Sailor’s
Life : His Experiences in Many Lands and on
Many Seas.” Chatto and Windus will probably
bring out the work. On the passage from ’Frisco
to Sydney Capt. Morse gave a lecture, much to
the amusement and edification of the passengers.
Now that the warm weather has arrived,
and the desire to wash occasionally pervades every
well-constituted human being, it is well to remem-
ber that the Natatorium, 400 Pitt-street, supplies
the largest variety of baths in Sydney. It is pos-
sible to wash in about 16 different ways at the
Natatorium, but perhaps the pleasantest features
of the establishment are the hot salt-water baths
and the big swimming bath, where a fine sample
of the crystal ocean is always on hand for the
benefit of those who’ like the briny deep brought
to their doors in a manner of speaking.*

i Yankee Doodle, 99 Mended with Politics,
The above is, of course, a caricature of the famous American national picture, which will b»
given later on. ,
“YANKEE DOODLE” is everywhere spoken of as the finest plug-tobacco that has evei
appeared here, and it has won greater success during the short time it has been on the market that
anything previously. This is no idle boast, aiicl, to prove it, any smoker can test the statement, fo*
there are few towns in N.S.W. where “YANKEE DOODLE” is not known and sold. Its sal*
has this year increased nearly one hundred (100) per cent over that of last year. And why is this
Simply that “YANKEE DOODLE” has struck the popular taste. In the first place, it comes, aft®
years of careful study, from a combination of certain choice Virginian tobaccos, so blended au<
exquisitely flavoured, that any smoker who can stand a tobacco heavier than the pure gold-leaf L
forced to admit that he has at last discovered something far and away better than anything he hai
been accustomed to. DIXSON & SONS have taken over half-a-century to accomplish this ; and, a<
their leading business has been built up on their reputation for QUALITY, they could not afford O'
make the foregoing statement if any doubt existed. DIN SON & SONS, who use more American leal
than all the other Tobacco Factories combined, are noted for several high-class brands: —“CON
QUEROR,” “SIR ROGER,” “CHAMPION,” and “DOLLAR;” but “YANKEE DOODLE*
ranks supreme.

Treasurer Ward’s Finances.
The financial statement which Treasurer
Ward recently presented to Maoriland
H. >use of Representatives is a fine example
of what the boom comes to when it grows
old, and the money is all spent, and the
great drunk is over, and only the recovery
remains; It is the same tale which every
Maoriland Treasurer has told for 10 years
past or more—a tale of desperate efforts to
keep up appearances, and to present some
respectable semblance of a surplus, and to
make a very little go a long way, and at the
same time to make it seem as if it v/ent far-
further than it really does. The result, as a
whole, is not particularly satisfactory. Mr.
Ward’s budget is probably, with one excep-
tion, the most honest and the most solvent
presented this year in Australasia, yet it is
not wholly honest, and it proves, now that
the complete figures are to hand, hardly
solvent in any reasonable acceptation of the
term. The total expenditure for next year
is set down at £4,331,000, and the total
legitimate revenue at £4,195,000, leaving a
massive deficiency to be faced, on 31st
March, 1896, of £136,000. But by a curious
juggle this is turned into a surplus of £9OOO.
In days gone by, Maoriland floated its loans
with a sinking - fund attached for their
redemption when they fell due. The sink-
ing fund never amounted to much ; at its
highest figure it reached about one-and-a-
half millions against nearly £40,000,000 of
debt. And, in 1884, the Government
conceived the great idea of borrowing
each year, and using for purposes
of revenue, an amount equal to that
paid into the fund —in other words, it
commenced, under Act of Parliament, to
borrow the sinking-fund payments for the
year, and the interest on the past accumula-
tions as well. Treasurer Ward proposes to
cadge £145,000 under this head during the
present year ; and his deficiency of £136,000
will thus be turned into an alleged surplus
of £9OOO.
* # •
This peculiar device was adopted to pre-
serve a hollow pretence of keeping faith
with the national creditor. The British
money-lender was promised a sinking-fund
as additional security for his money. To
have actually suspended payment of the
promised annual instalments would have
looked too much like repudiation, therefore
the Maoriland Treasury pays the amount
out of the revenue with one hand and
borrows with the other a similar amount
which is put into the revenue. This is not,
in any sense, the Treasurer’s own swindle ;
it is done openly under an Act of Parlia-
ment passed for the especial purpose, and is
a national and Parliamentary swindle in
which everybody takes a hand. For some
years past the Government has been able to
produce a small surplus over and above the
amount raised by this peculiar and rather
shady device, and the money which was
virtually borrowed out of the sinking-fund
has gone, along with the legitimate sav-
ings made out of revenue, to construct
railways and other public works. So
long as this was the case the proceeding
was comparatively unobjectionable ; at the
worst it was a clumsy and foolish piece of
book-keeping whereby the surplus was made
to look larger than it really was. In the
estimates for next year, however, the amount
borrowed out of the sinking-fund is almost
all needed to meet ordinary expenditure.
Moreover, Mr. Ward has had to hunt
desperately around in the odd corners of the
Treasury, and to discover certain alleged
sums, about £25,000 in all, which he claims
to have forgotten to borrow in previous
years, and but for this professed discovery
even his borrowings would not have made
the public accounts for the coming year look
reasonably square. Under all these circum-
stances there is an ancient and fish-like
aspect about the promised £9OOO surplus—
which is not much of a surplus, even if it
were above suspicion ; and, according to any
really legitimate system of book-keeping, it
looks much more like a shortage of
£136,000.
# # *
Maoriland ostensibly stopped borrowing a
number of years ago and did not resume the
evil practice until a few weeks since, when it
floated the first 3 per cent, loan in Aus-
tralasian history. But even during the
years when it was alleged to have sworn off
the unclean thing the public debt kept
increasing in small, mysterious ways, by
conversions, the borrowing of trust funds,
and other unnoticed devices. The sinking-
fund faded peacefully away from £1,485,000
in 1891 to £751,000 in 1895. The net public
debt was £36,980,000 in 1889, and it reached
£39,635,000 in the early part of 1895, since
which date it has been further increased by
one-and-a-half-millions. The one redeem-
ing feature in the case is that the population
of the province increased considerably faster
than its debts, so that Maoriland —until a
few weeks ago —could boast of being the
only Australasian province where the debt
per inhabitant was steadily declining. Also,
the borrowed money seems, on the whole, to
have been used with great prudence, and
invested in works which will at least pay
interest on their cost. Nevertheless, the
solemn fact remains that the only Austra-
lasian province which has made a serious
attempt to stop the accumulation of debt has
failed badly in the attempt. Whether a
stronger man than Ward or a better man
than Seddon might have succeeded it is
difficult to say. Also, whether they really
desired to make the country solvent, or
whether they only wanted, like so many
other politicians, to make it look solvent for
the sake of themselves and their party, is
an open question. But there is no doubt
that the people of Maoriland swore off bor-
rowing some years ago in dead earnest, or in
what they believed to be dead earnest, and it
is equally certain that the results of that
great renunciation have been only a modified
success.
# * #
In various ways the prospects for the com-
ing year are hardly cheerful. The revenue
has shown a declining tendency for some
time past, and Treasurer Ward estimates
that for the year ending March, 1896, there
will be a further decline of nearly £86,000.
Instead of resolutely cutting down expendi-
ture to meet this expected falling-off, the
estimated outlay is increased by £65,000,
and various gorgeous proposals are advanced
for subsidising a new line of steamers and a
Pacific cable, all of which look like signs of
a tendency to fall away into the garish
magnificence of the old Vogel era. The
Government has a vast, indefinite liability'
on hand in the shape of the unfinished Mid-
land railway and the litigation attached
thereto, which should make it abjure new
steamship subsidies and cable lines now
above all times ; and it has another possible
responsibility in the shape of its £2,000,000
guarantee on behalf of the Bank of New
Zealand. It has now been found necessary
to further assist that luckless institu-
tion, which means another indefinite liabi-
lity. Also, the great experiment of the
State Loan Department is still in an embryo
state, and though it has every prospect of
success, still it furnishes another reason why
Maoriland should go slow in the matter of
incurring new liabilities. There is very
little elasticity in the revenue of the province
nowadays. With the exception of Queens-
land and South Australia, it has the big-
gest debt and the biggest interest bill per
head of population in Australasia. Its
public lands were sold in a joyous,
irresponsible fashion in the good old days,
and all that remains of its once magnificent
territorial revenue is £300,000 per annum—
less than one-seventh of that enjoyed by
New South Wales. Its railway revenue has
been declining for two or three years past,
and the Maoriland lines now, pay only £2
14s. 6d. per cent, on their cost. Under all
these adverse circumstances Maoriland has
to grind out of its people four times as much
in direct taxation as is paid by the inhabi-
tants of New South Wales, and more than
twice as much as is levied on the people of
Australia and Tasmania in general. It had
far less resources to begin with than its
continental neighbors, and the twin curses of
war and Vogelism fell upon the country with
crushing weight. The conduct of its people
for the last few years has been a brilliant
example of dogged resolution to get through
honestly under enormous difficulties, and
the pity is that the result hasn’t been com-
mensurate with the effort.
■* * *
The situation which the Sbddon Govern-
ment refuses to face is practically this : In
order to finish its uncompleted railways and
other public works at even a very slow rate
of progression, the country needs to raise
something like £300,000 per annum out of
legitimate revenue, and this can only be
done by more economy, or more taxation, or
by finding new sources of income, or by all
of these combined. Meanwhile, Treasurer
Ward proposes instead to undertake a
wholesale conversion of the public debt into
3 per cent, stock, which can only mean add-
ing a good many millions to the principal in
order to save a few thousands annually in
interest. Also, he proposes to establish a
sinking-fund for the gradual extinction of the
debt —which sounds like a wildly humorous
suggestion, coming, as it does, from a financier
who is grabbing every available coin of the
existing fund for revenue purposes. Maori-
land’s past experience in this direction shows
conclusively that no sinking-fund is safe un-
less it can be put out of the reach of the
Treasurer, the Government, the Legislature
and even the nation itself ; and the difficulty
of devising any means by which the country
can put its own money out of its own reach
seems almost insuperable. The existing
fund was protected by every legislative
device imaginable, and when bad times and
the Stout-Vogel coalition arrived they all
proved of no account. The moral is that
the average Parliament is a financial dipso-
maniac which can’t trust itself within reach
of the public cash, and unless the Seddon
Ministry can suggest some means of effectu-
ally tying itself up so that it can’t get any-
where near the new fund, that will also be
borrowed just as soon as it gets large enough
to be worth borrowing. Some day, perhaps,
a benevolent Fat Man, or association of Fat
Men, will start a sinking-fund as an
act of private patriotism, by depositing
£1,000,000 worth of Government debentures
with the Bank of England, to accumulate at
compound interest until the total is sufficient
to pay off the public debt in one sudden
operation. Then, as the money will not be
the property of the nation, it will be beyond
the reach of Parliament, and no Government
will be able to lay hands on it, and the
Agent-General will howl on the door-mat of
the Bank and try in vain to borrow it, and
the Treasurer will go “ home ” on special
missions and implore the directors to lend it
to him, but all to no purpose. Lnder such
circumstances as these it is possible that a
sinking-fund might become a useful reality,
but under no other conditions that The
Bulletin can conceive is such a thing
likely.
* * •
The Seddon Government has probably a
better record than any other now existing in
Australasia, that of Victoria alone excepted.
If it isn’t absolutely honest that fact is partly
owing to its predecessors and to Parliament,
partly to the system of Party Government,
and partly to the dismal fact that the
way back to solvency is very long and
dreary, and that the public debt has a
gruesome way of increasing imperceptibly
on its own account when the country isn’t
looking. Also, it is probably owing in part
to Treasurer Ward’s recent mission to Eng-
land. Every “colonial” statesman within
the memory of this generation who has gone
on a mission to that great and grovelsome
land, has come back with a yearning to
scatter the public money on cable subsidies
or other devices for tightening the “silken
bonds of h’empire,” or to float big loans, or
undertake huge conversion operations, or
otherwise to do things which are a great
deal too large for the circumstances of the
country. Despite all the gorgeous figures of
Coghlan and Haytbr, the obvious fact
remains that these provinces are miserably
poor. Victoria, Tasmania, and S.A. have
each a chronic deficiency. Queensland has
a bogus surplus made out of borrowed money;
New South Wales has another, made by
cooking the loan accounts and charging the
repairs of old dredges and the like to pos-
terity ; and Maoriland is living just now on
borrowing the sinking-fund for revenue pur-
poses. Under these conditions this country
can’t afford to send its statesmen “ home ”
to acquire large and gorgeous ideas in the
atmosphere of Lombard-street, and Treasurer
Ward’s “ mission ” is likely to spoil that
hitherto plain and useful person for purposes
of local consumption.
Federation v. Suppuration.
In a recent Bulletin “Treble B.” attacks the
idea of present Federation and deprecates
this paper’s enthusiasm for Australia against
the world. As his main argument, “Treble
B.” pillories the reputations of our politi-
cians and “leaders.” But why are they
failures and pettifoggers ? Simply because they
are elected to secure a local distribution oi
public works, J.P.-ships, and free railway
passes. The decision of national questions is
entrusted to them accidentally. It is as if the
contractor for street-cleaning stumbled on an
obscure clause in his bontract which required
him to provide the meteorological report —as if
the inspector of nuisances were made Supreme
Court Judge for economy’s sake. The curse of
Australian Parliaments is the parochial nature
of their work, and the revolting duties that
impudent constituents impose on their repre-
sentatives. The remedy for this is the exten-
sion and democratisation of municipal powers—
and Federation. Shall national issues be
decided by men elected for parochial issues?
As long as Australia is merely a geographical
expression it will be so. As long as small men
are elected to large duties will the Dibbses take
a title to oblige a lady, and the Reids borrow
money from England to cobble up Monkey
Creek bridge. As long as Castlemaine’s
“ Thirteen Pubs. ” dictate the issues of a par-
liamentary contest will butchers in thought
and principle be pitchforked into power to koo-
too to George and May and prospective
babies. The prostitution by small politicians
of the national dignity can be prevented by
having a Federal Parliament for the decision of
national issues only.
• * #
As to “partial Federation being peculiarly
liable to disruption ” —the facts are the other
way. Partial Federation continues till public
awakening or some pressing need makes it
perfect. Germany, Switzerland, and Canada
are not federations made at one blow, and their
history discounts “ Treble B’s ” contention 100
per cent. How then is Australia interested in
partial federation? N.S. Wales, Victoria, and
S.A. could come to an understanding, more or
less complete, on three subjects :
1. Customs.
2. Banking.
3. Railways.
Regarding Customs there have been suggested in
The Bulletin (17/11/’94) certain lines on which
interprovincial tariffs might be modified at once,
at the will of the Ministers, without legislative
jaw-wagging.

Regarding banking, N.S. Wales, Victoria,
and S.A. have indubitably at this moment an
unequalled opportunity for establishing a
federal note-issue. The very Banks themselves
are craving for Governmental intervention, and
the crying need for stability in financial matters
urges on the Governments to action. There
might be, perhaps is, objection to three separate
State banks in these provinces, but the estab-
lishment of one bank on broad lines, with good,
well-paid, able, independent men at the head
and control of things, backed by the three pro-
vinces, and run in the interests of the three
provinces, would do more to straighten up
Australia than all the “many little useful
things so momentous in the aggregate ” for
which the soul of “Treble B.” yearns. As
for the railways—has ever anyone heard of
a trust or ring among trading firms ? A
trust is a fair or unfair combination to
abolish competition. It is done, as a rule,
by companies which do not insist on equal
capitalisation and the etfacement of the
numerous irrelevant financial differences that
anti-Federationists are fond of setting up.
What objection is there to a Victorian, New
South Wales and South Australian Railway
Trust —such as has been known between mighty
railway organisations in England and the States?
At present, New South Wales, Victoria and
South Australia tax themselves for railway
expenditure which partly benefits Riverina but
is principally pure waste. An interprovincial
Railway Trust would settle the vexed question
of management for all time. When the Vic-
torian Government lately wanted railway
advice they dared not ask Eddy, because he
was the manager of a viral .system. With a
Railway Trust the three provinces could sa\e
money in scores and hundreds of thousands by
securing the three best procurable railway
managers, one for each province.—the three to
be a federal railway council. All which shows
that “Treble B.” errs when he depreciates
Federation, partial Federation, and even talk
about Federation. Federation in all or part
should commence to-day.
PLAIN ENGLISH.
Botany Bay “Justice.”
The case of the cabman, Sweetman, sentenced
to 14 years’ imprisonment and two or three
floggings for his alleged share in the Mount
Rennie business, is also to be considered by the
Govt. Commissioner who is enquiring into the
main case. No more glaringly cruel case
of injustice than that of Sweetman can be
found on the legal records of Botany Bay, from
the year One. The man acted immorally, it is
true: he sat on his vehicle and crooked his
finger at a complaisant girl, who was dawdling
on the sidewalk and who got into his cab and
went where he wanted her to go —and after-
wards told a lot of transparent lies about
having been driven off against her will (through
a thickly-populated neighborhood where, by
means of one shriek, she could almost at any
moment have summoned 100 rescuers had she
desired rescue). The Court sitting in that
bloodstained time of panic swallowed her
absurd story, with the result that Sweetman
was sentenced as aforesaid. If the prisoner’s
deed deserved so frightful a penalty, where
is there a “ man of the world ” who should
go unwhipped ? Sweetman’s sentence can
be justified by no one who is not pre-
pared to attribute to that libidinous cabman the
omniscience of Gou Almighty. He drove the
girl off, it is true, for Ids own purposes,
but how was he to know what would be the
ultimate effects of an excursion for the whole
results of which, he was told, when sentence
was passed upon him, he was “ morally respon
sible ” ? The fact of the matter is that there
never was (taking the teim in its accepted
sense) any Mount Rennie “outrage” at all.
The girl, a lying little street tramp, went away


voluntarily with a dirty cabman to a dirty
location for a dirty purpose, the consummation
of which purpose was interfered with by the
appearance on the scene of a number of dirty
little larrikins, with whom, or some of whom,
she at once voluntarily entered into immoral
relations. Where her consent ended and the
“outrage,” if there ever was an “outrage,”
began, is by no means clear. Certain it is that
the girl lied when she professed to identify all
those who she said had outraged her ; and it is
a fact that she subsequently declared in writing
that she was only sure of one. And certain it is
that in the forged-cheque-passer, Stanley, and
the arsonist, Smith, the chief Crown witnesses
of the “outrage,” the prosecution had two
deponents so utterly conscienceless and un-
trustworthy that no human being would be
justified in shedding blood upon their testimony
even to the extent of slicing from a decaying
leper material for a microscopic-slide.
The Convict Brand of Justice.
The conduct of Westralian Government in
smothering the prosecution of one Gehald
Raikes met with some remarkably plain
criticism from W.A. Judge Hensman recently.
Raikes was a person who is alleged to have
owned Oscar Wilde’s vice without Wilde’s
intellect, and he claimed the name of and rela-
tionship to a former English Minister of the
Crown. Consequently, as soon as he struck
Westralia, society received him with open
arms, and he was given a lucrative
position in W.A. Civil Service. A few
months ago society was shocked to hear
that a conscientious J.P. had issued a warrant
for Raikes’s arrest for vicious practices. He
was several times brought before Perth police
court, but apparently no attempt was made by
the authorities to produce the evidence against
him, and he was quietly discharged, and seems
to have lost no time in leaving the province.
During a libel case tried before Judge Hens-
man last month, which turned on alleged
indecent actions in which “20 or 30 boys ” of
a leading Perth school were said to be implicated.
Mr. Cowan, P.M. of Perth, was examined
as a witness, and gave the following evidence :
Was it through your instrumentality, Mr. Cowan»
that the action was started against Raikes ?—lt was; I
discovered it and reported it.
Raikes was arrested by the police?—Yes.
The case dropped out, and subsequently an information
was laid by a private individual? —Yes.
He was in the Government service?—Yes.
Where is he now ?—He has left the colony.
Was he dismissed, or did he leave?—l believe he was
dismissed. If your Honor will allow me to say so, I may
stale i hat when I left for the south I left two magistrates,
Mr. Traylen and Mr. James, the latter of whom I ac-
quainted with the whole of the evidence. We were send-
ing for two boys, but we had complete evidence against
him, so far as I could judge as a magistrate. I believe
that it was afterwards thought right that no further
action should be taken in the matter, and that the boys
should not be brought forward. It was thought best to
suppress the scandal.
By his Honor: Who allowed him to escape ?—I don’t
know, sir. There are those hitjher than I.
Upon which Judge Hensman, in summing-up,
made this comment :
I only know of Raikes by what I heard in this court in
evidence. This man was in the Government service, and
he seems to have been charged with a certain offence, and
I say no more than this: That there has been a deplorable
miscarriage of justice in not having him brought to trial
and his guilt or his innocence established, and I trust the
time will never come when any suspicion would arise in
the minds of the public that considerations such as the
feelings of others, or the position of the party, would be
allowed to interfere with the due administration of jus-
tice. I have said this because it has appeared to me the
occasion warrants it, and I hope it will be long before I,
at all events, have occasion to make any such remark
again.
In plain words, the Westralian gang in officer
already accused of being mixed up in electoral
thimble-rigging and unsavory mine transac
tions, now practically stands charged by a Judge
of the Supreme Court with a conspiracy to
defeat the ends of justice in the interests of a
well-connected society man. One law for the
rich, another for the poor, and none at all for
gentlemen with English letters of introduction.
“ Encouraging ” Local Industry.
In the sacred name of Revenue, with the sole
hope of swelling the importation of foreign
wines, the Vic. Assembly has inflicted a swing-
ing amendment on the present duties. Still
wines— i.e., the brands that compete against
local production —pay 2s. per bottle at the
Customs now. The reformed tariff will let
them into the importer’s warehouse for Is. per
bottle, consequently the absorption of foreign
claret, hock, chablis, sauterne, port, sherry,
&c., must be doubled ere the revenue can make
an extra penny. Only one excuse was offered
for this big move. Somebody had an idea—or,
he said he had it—that the public liking for
Victorian wine, in preference to beer and spirits,
would be encouraged thereby. Such very
bright ideas are Flinders Lane inspirations,
as a rule. Those people for whom cheap,
wholesome dinner wines have no charm
are not likely to cultivate a taste for
liquors of similar qualities at high prices.
On the other hand, it is clear that wine-
drinkers, being, for the most part, stubbornly
prejudiced in favor of the foreign article, and
only taking local “ imitations ” on sufferance
since the duties were raised in 1892, will simply
he encouraged by this shilling reduction to
return to their old love. Men now in course of
slow compulsory conversion will backslide and
become more rabid bigots than ever. With the
exception of the bright idea aforesaid there
wasn’t a semblance of a reasonable argument
raised by the tariff “ reformers.” Mr. Tucker
showed that the sale of foreign wines
had dropped to one - third of the boom-
time average, also that the consumption
of Victorian grape-juice last year was slightly
less than before, and because “bounders” don’t
squander champagne now, as in the period of
fraudulent “prosperity,” and because many of
their depressed victims can’t afford an occa-
sional shilling for Victorian claret, Tucker
called for reform. Mr. G. D. Carter reduced
his argument to an idiotic conundrum —“ What
was the use of maintaining high duties when
the wine of the country was so cheap
that he could supply any member of the
House with 100,000 gallons at lOd. a gallon?
Carter’s conundrum should have deteated
its object by persuading the House to put
a prohibitive duty right away upon cheap
French and German stuff, extracted from grape-
skins and not from grapes —but no. Mr.
Trenwith reminded them that the export
trade in Victorian wine was increasing annually,
the best of all proofs that it deserves to be
forced into favor on the spot by high protective
duties. Nevertheless, prejudice and com-
mercial influence carried their point. The
Minister of Customs thought it “ perfectly
safe ” to knock Is. per bottle off the tariff, and
expect the demand for foreign wine to be
doubled immediately, and the Government
voted with the majority, which was only a
majority of seven.
Treasurer Reid’s Trickery.
Treasurer Reid proposes to collect the present
New South Wales Customs duties till the end
of September, and to levy the land and income-
tax, which is supposed to replace them, from
•the beginning of July, and by thus double-
banking the taxpayer for three months a surplus
of .£lBl,OOO is expected. This would go a
good way towards paying for the repairs to old
dredges, and for patching the Windsor bridge,
and building the bridge over the Bogan at
Monkey, and wood-blocking certain Sydney
streets, but these are all to be charged to loan-
expenditure as previously proposed, while the
surplus is largely fooled away in “ special
grants to municipalities.” There is no
earthly reason why the municipalities should
have a special grant just now, except that it
may buy support for G. H. Reid ; the whole
idea of local government is to make the muni-
cipalities pay their own expenses and to do
without grants, and, in any case, the municipal
grants are fixed by law, and no Treasurer has a
right to make additional allowances, either for
advertisement or to buy votes or for any other
purpose, until he has first paid all his legitimate
expenses out of revenue. And, considering that
Mr. Reid took £389,000 out of loan funds
and included it in revenue, and charged
.£216,000 of his road and bridge expenditure
to his predecessors, thus adding it to the
deficiency, and that he proposes to charge
between £600,000 and £700,000 of his own
current road and bridge expenditure to loans,
and that he has left over £200,000 of the year’s
ordinary expenditure unprovided for by passing
it on to next year, and that he closed last year
with a deficit, his pretence that he has a large
sum of money to give away needlessly in
municipal endowments is an unspeakable
mockery. It is merely another aspect of the
old, old story : no average Treasurer under the
party system cares a straw whether the finances
are square or not: all he wants is to make them
look square. The business of every Treasurer
is to cook his predecessor’s accounts so as to
show a big deficit, and to cook his own so as to
show a sham surplus, and to reduce taxation
and increase the road and bridge expenditure
and darn the consequences generally. Some
day, of course, the consequences may refuse to
be darned any longer, but that is a mere detail.
Victoria’s Amateur Magistrates.
The dignity of Melbourne’s unpaid magistracy
suffered a severe shock the other day, when a
J.P. made a few well-chosen remarks from the
Bench regarding himself and his species in gene-
ral. Taking advantage of a moment’s silence,
this gentleman started, apropos of nothing at
all, to state that some very unpleasant things
had been said about the injustice, ignorance,
and one-sideduess of the amateur magistracy,
that most of these accusations were strictly
true, and that the sooner the whole system was
“burst-up” the better. His fellow-J’s.P., as
soon as they discovered the drift of his observa-
tions, shook him imploringly by the elbow and
besought him to keep quiet, but he went right
on with his blasting observations until he was
smothered by the hurried adjournment of the
court. The scope for strong language afforded
by the Victorian J.P. system is practically un-
limited. In Victoria, almost all the people of
any consequence, and many other people, are
J’s.P., and have a right to sit on the Bench and
overrule the stipendiary magistrates. Most of
them know little or no law, and almost all of
them turn up only when they have their own
special axe to grind. In liquor cases the bench
is rushed by teetotallers and wine-and-spirit
merchants, &c., the former being there mostly
to decide against the publican regardless of the
evidence, and the latter to decide for him regard-
less of the evidence. The shameless old system
about which, years ago, Marcus Clarke
had so much to say, is still in full blast.
“ When some poor devil of a civil-servant dis-
putes a pawnbroker’s account for interest on
a pledged waistcoat,” wrote Clarke, apropos
of the appointment to the magistracy of many
usurers who had as bond-slaves politicians
of the day, “ the Bench looks like Pelican
Island in the breeding season, by reason of
the multitude of beaks hanging over the rail-
ings.” And the same statement applies, in
various forms, all round. A few J’s.P.
are more or less crazed on sexual questions,
and, when a shady female accuses a man of
“assault,” they arrive with a rush to jump on
the unfortunate accused in the interests of
morality—the dirty variety of it. Masonic
J’s.P. will roll up to see the suspected brother
through his troubles. Irish J’s.P. frequently
come along when Patrick Murphy is in worse
trouble than usual; Scotch J’s. P. do likewise.
Fat Men J’s.P. roll up to promptly dismiss the
charge against the influential person who is
alleged to have run a cronk bank, and J’s.P.
who lost their money in his bank arrive to vote
against them. When an influential young man
“goes wrong” his uncle and all the other
J’s.P. in the family come along to help in dis-
missing the case. Pious, churchgoing J’s.P.,
in long, black tail-coats, fill the Bench and
overflow into the body of the Court when an
especially good man is charged with something,
and fat, chuckling J’s.P. to the number of 40 or
so overcrowd the premises when a particularly
objectionable case of any kind is on the board.
The J.P. has no salary or billet or legal reputa-
tion to lose by his vagaries, so he does very
much as he likes, and his administration of
justice is a scandal and a disgrace. In the
capital of New South Wales he has been prac-
tically abolished in his judicial capacity, for
the sufficient reason that the community could
endure him no longer, and though the stipen-
diary magistrate who succeeded him is far from
satisfactory at times, he is at least responsible
for his actions, and has some elementary ideas
of law and occasionally of equity ; also, the
police-magistrates are growing cleaner as the
years roll by. Victoria, for some unexplained
reason, still tolerates the amateur “ beak.”
The Logic of Isaac Mo,
Apropos to a comment upon Daimio’s price
(3 to 1) for the Caulfield G.N. Steeplechase, a
fortnight before the race, sundry bookmakers’
champions have supplied this journal with
trumpery evidence in favor of Ikby Mo as
against the betting machine, which draws a fixed
commission and doesn’t swear. The Bulletin
gathers from these excited correspondents that
whereas Ikey Mo sometimes falls into liquid-
ation and is finally wound up, the tote
goes placidly on for ever, therefore Ikey’s
profits must be extremely moderate. One
earnest pleader asks “where are Cuss,
Swear, Scream and the hundreds of one-
time kings of the ring ? ” (giving their
real names.) A question as to the where-
abouts of the Jubilee Juggins would not
be further from the point. When Cuss, Swear
and Co. laid to their books steadily, and
didn’t back horses, own horses, play hazard,
and live like twenty fighting-cocks at a
time, instead of like one individual fighting-
cock, they amassed riches at a much greater rate,
in proportion to their annual turnover, than the
tote can rake it in. When they either didn’t
stick to their legitimate business, or did wildly
foolish things outside of it, or were “ let in ” by
land-boomers, they were as likely to come to
poverty as the punters who had kept them in
affluent circumstances for many a year. Apart
from the unchallenged fact that bookmakers
are laughed to scorn by the tote every time
a rank “outsider” gets home (which is not by
any means a rare accident), figures show that
the tote’s average dividend on second, third,
fourth, &c., favorites is much greater than
Ikey’s starting-price. Also, the tote’s first
favorite, when he wins, is a more remunerative
animal than Ikey’s “red-hot pot.” The pos-
sible ultimate failure of that parasite to reach
the cemetery in a coach and four, and sleep
under a costly tombstone, is, considering all
these circumstances, very discreditable to him.
He is taught thrift at school ; Providence is
awfully good to him; he ought to cut up
fat after his decease. Worldly justice wouldn’t
throw a bone to a starving bookmaker. As for
the contention that long odds from the tote
only go to benefit “ drunken fools or chows,”
this journal can’t imagine any type of citizen
less deserving than Ikey Mo. Likewise, this
journal doesn’t accept the “fools or chows”
theory. The ignorant investor who throws
away his sovereign on a horse that has “ no
chance,” and scoops the pool for his temerity,
is more often than not one of the steadiest and
broadest-minded fellows on the course. He has
come there for a careless day’s outing, not for
the foolish, chowish purpose of trying to make
money by his blessed “knowledge” of the
business in hand.
A Local Option Bill.
The Cold Tea faction in Maoriland has urged
the reluctant Seddon Government into taking
some rather uncertain steps in the direction of
Local Option. Judging from present appear-
ances, the most probable result is that the
Ministry will disgust the liquor-party by its
interference, and won’t satisfy the Cold Tea
brigade—for the reason that its action is feeble
and lukewarm, and is constructed on a plan
which promises the maximum of fuss and the
minimum of result. The Bill provides that, at
certain dates, a poll shall be taken all over the
country on four distinct questions : (1) Whether
the number of licences then existing in the dis-
trict shall remain unaltered ; (2) whether the
number of licences in the district shall be
reduced ; (3) whether licences shall be alto-
gether abolished in the district ; and (4) whether
licences shall be altogether abolished through-
out the province. A bare majority may decide
that the existing licences shall be maintained or
that they shall be reduced, but it takes a three-
fifths majority to enforce total prohibition.
The anguish of the Cold Tea taction arises from
the fact that this arrangement deliberately
splits up their vote, while that of the
liquor crowd must of necessity remain solid.
The drinky section of the community has
only one thing to vote for —that the number of
licences remain as it is. The teetotal crowd is
invited to spread itself over two issues—reduc-
tion and absolute prohibition, and thus wreck
its chances by splitting the Cold Tea vote. As
Robert Stout pointed out in the House, 3000
citizens might vote at a local-option poll, 1709
declaring for absolute prohibition throughout
the district; 1209 for a reduction in the number
of licences ; and one—only one—for preserving
things as they were. Whereupon the 1790
would be defeated, because 1800 constituted
the three-fifths majority necessary to enforce
total prohibition; and the 1209 would be
of no account because 1501 votes were
needed to effect a reduction. Therefore,
the lonesome, red-nosed drinker would carry
the day with his block vote of one, and
things would remain as they were until next
poll, despite the fact that 2999 people were
arrayed against him, simply by reason of the
splitting-up of the Cold Tea vote. The Govern-
ment, however, refused to be moved by Stout’s
eloquence, and rushed the Bill through its
second reading. It will probably have cause to
regret, later on, that it touched the matter at
all. The liquor crowd looks askance at
the Seddon Ministry, and wants to know why
it interfered witli the question, and the
Cold Tea gathering will probably feel very bad
towards it by-and-bye, when it fully realises
the futility of this peculiar kind of local option.
As a rule, when a Cabinet is invited to tackle
the drink question the safest thing it can do is
to be so busy starting a State Bank, or convert-
ing the public debt, or something, that it has
no time to attend to the matter.
Australian law doesn’t travel on any fixed
principle ; you drop a penny in the slot and
get three months, or ss. fine, or get hanged,
pretty much at random. The following is a
case in point. In Sydney, a few weeks back,
a somewhat inebriated individual was run in
for having in his possession “ property reason-
ably supposed to be stolen.” There was not
a shadow of evidence that he had stolen
the property; he wasn’t known to the
police as a thief or any other kind of
criminal; he was simply found with pro-
perty in his possession like 99 per cent,
of the men one meets in the street, and a
constable chose to think he looked like a
man who might have stolen the property,
though no one had reported losing it. If the
accused had been sober he would probably have
explained, but unluckily he wasn’t, and the
law, without waiting for him to recover his
faculties, gave him three months for (as already
mentioned) “ having property in his posses-
sion,” &c. When the prisoner realised
his position he explained where he bought
the property, and his statements proving
absolutely accurate he was released in a
gradual sort of way, when the law got suffi-
ciently rested. There was no inquiry; the
policeman who accused him of being “ reason-
ably suspected ” wasn’t called on, so far as is
known, to explain his reasons, nor was the
magistrate who convicted him on no visible
grounds save that a policeman said he was
“reasonably suspected.” The accused was
simply discharged, and when he got back to his
lodging he found that all his worldly goods had
been pawned during his absence. The man who
took them was hunted up and convicted, and he
was fined 405., or one month. As the other man
got three months, it follows, therefore, that it is
just three times as criminal to be found with
goods in your possession, which a policeman
says he thinks, on no visible evidence, are
stolen, as to be absolutely and definitely con-
victed of pawning another man’s property.
The appeal to the Privy Council on New South
Wales Payment of Members Act will have a
little value if the Judges there can be led into
expressing an opinion on the general wording
of that particular measure. To soften antagon-
isms, plain English was eschewed by the
framers of the Bill, and, as it passed through
Parliament, it was not payment of members it
provided for, but a refund of expenses incurred
in the Parliamentary representation of elec-
torates. Thus a man is not paid for being a
member, but for the money he is presumed to be
out of pocket and the time he consumes in dis-
charging his Parliamentary duties. How in
this sense are M‘Millan, M.P. for Burwood,
and others situated? Assuming M'Millan
draws the <£3oo during his absence in England,
how can he exhibit the equivalent in services
rendered ? The Payment of Members Act, or
Parliamentary Allowances Act, should be
amended so as to make it really what the
general public intended it to be —that is, pay-
ment to the member as member, without
any mystifying phrases to placate a few indivi-
duals and possibly provoke litigation.
South Australia finds itself in a tight place
financially, and, despite the fact that the ordi-
nary expenditure has been cut down nearly
£230,000 since 1891, it has to save another
£60,000 at the least —possibly £lOO,OO0 —to
make ends meet. Treasurer Holder, proposes
to raise £30,000 of this by the stupid and cruel
device of an all-round reduction of Civil Service
salaries. This comes on top of another reduc-
tion made only last year. There is here no
attempt at discrimination between good men
and bad the same-sized piece is to be
carved off in each case, just to show the S.A.
civil-servant that it is as profitable to be a
lazy, incompetent ass as to be anything else,
for the reduction will come in either case.
Holder’s budget is one of several things which
seem to suggest that the Kingston Ministry
has seen its best days. S.A. has now air
accumulated deficit of £900,000, and the
Government dare not propose further taxation,
and makes no serious effort to meet the diffi-
culty. Of all the Australian financiers Turner,
of Victoria, is the only one who has shown
himself equal to the occasion. In the other
provinces the same old crowd still potters
round and lives in hope ; the financial crisis
brought- no new genius to the front. But
Victoria had the w’orst crisis of all, and
straightway an inconsiderable-looking little fat
man with a shamefully bad hat emerged from
the ruck and proved himself the one individual
who was capable of meeting the emergency.
There was a chorus of Sydney-press jubilation
over the fact that Acting-Judge Cohen sent
Alfred Windon, Stewart Dawson’s jewel-
robber, to the Carpenterian reformatory for
three years, instead of consigning him to gaol
“to mix with felons.” Yet the Carpenterian
reformatory at Eastwood (N.S.W.), better
known as the Brush Farm reformatory, is little
better than a hell college. The men admitted
there are all supposed to be able to do a little
work, though unable to earn a living outside.
The reformatory boys also work, and go
through a daily farce of two hours called
“school.” There is no schoolmaster; but an
official known departmentally as “ the atten-
dant,” and who, to ordinary eyes, is a turnkey
without keys to turn, does his level best
to do the duty asked from him. Men and
boys have their meals and spend their
evenings in the same room, though they
do not at these times actually mix. At
other times there is practically free inter-
course. The boys are far and away the more
vicious. Before any reforming work can be
done on the lines of Mary Carpenter (1) all
the adults should be shifted ; (2) the boys
themselves should be classified ; (3) a compe-
tent schoolmaster should be appointed ; (4) a
system of rewards and encouragements should
be provided to cultivate the manly instincts
that cannot yet be quite dead in the minds
of the boys ; (5) the pretence of gaol regime
should be abolished. All the reformation of
which the Brush Farm institution is capable at
present is insufficient to save the millionth part
of one stained juvenile soul.
The Young Women’s Christian Association
and the Women’s Christian Temperance Union
are said to have agreed to canvass against Premier
Kingston at West Adelaide next year.

A BEAUTIFUL COMPLEXION,
It has long been known to scientists that for
improving the appearance and beautifying the
face oatmeal is far and away superior to all other
foods, but it had one drawback— the tendency to
heat the blood. To overcome this defect the at-
tention of eminent scientists has been devoted to

The N.S.W, Government is going to float, in
London, a loan of £3,727,'>00 to meet £2,750,000 worth of
Treasury hills which fall clue next \ ear and £977,01/0 of an
old 6 per cent, loan incurred in 1867. After this is done
Premier Held promises to swear off borrowing in England
and float his loans on the local market, as he thinks “ it
will be well not to increase the burden of foreign indebted-
ness.” Under these circumstances, it would be interest-
ing to know why Premier 1L id is going to do the very
thing he says it would be well not to do. Of the above-
mentioned Treasury bills, £750.000 worth are held in New
South Wales, and, by borrowing in London to repay this
amount, Mr. Reid deliberately increases the foreign in-
debtedness of the country to that extent and deprives the
local holder of the investment. And—even apart from the
fact that the N.S.W. Premier is tints doing the direct oppo-
site of what he says he should do—if Mr. Reid has realised,
as he says he has, that it is better to depend on the local
market, why doesn’t he begin at once? When a man is
going to swear off drink, it is no good to commence by
marking r the date on the calendar, 12 months hence, when
he will begin to sober up. It would he easy. The Bul-
letin firmly believes, to obtain locally, at a reasonable
rate of interest, the money required to renew next year’s
liabilities—at all events, it would be as easy to get that
lot of money as the other lot which the Premier says he
is going to get later on, and the experiment is worth
trying in any case. Therefore, The Bulletin sums tip
the case in two questions: Since Premier Reid believes lie
shouldn’t increase .the country’s foreign liabilities why
does he do it? And, since lie believes he should depend
on the local money-market, why doesn’t he do it?

The S. A. State Land Bank scheme is a beauti-
fully simple device which, if it only proves workable, will
reduce the difficulties of the scheme to a minimum. The
borrower who wants to raise £lOOO w ill mortgage bis land
to the State Bank in the usual way at a rate which is not
to exceed 5 per cent, and which may be as low ns
4J. .The bank, instead of giving him money, will give
him £lOOO worth of bonds bearing interest at 4 per cent.,
and he will sell these to investors and get his cash. As
the bonds will be a safe investment, guaranteed by the
State, easily' transferable, and bearing a fair rate of in-
terest, it is expected that there will be a constant demand
for them by banks, insurance and building societies,
trustees, and private investors, and that they will always
fetch par or thereabouts. Tie borrower will pay his in-
Italments of principal and interest to the department,
ind as fast as they come in the money will
be used to buy up aod extinguish the bonds.
Consequently, the department will never have on
hand any money w hich is not bearing interest, as would
be the case if it borrowed a big capital to start with and
lent out actual cash. If .the public takes kindly to the
new securities the scheme looks perfect, save for one
thing o dv—it is seemingly proposed to charge only
er oueh additional interest to cover the working expenses
of the d part men I, so if, despite the precautions taken,
there is su h a fall in land-values as to make many of the
securities insufficc nt, there will he no reserve-fund to fall
back upon—at. least, there is no definite provision for the
establishment of such a fund. And as the total unim-
proved land-values of S.A. are alleged to have dropped
from £45,000.000 in 1884 to ‘ 25,000,000 in 1895, even the
most careful Land Bank may be “left" some time or other,
if it doesn’t prepare for contingencies.

The Kingston Govt.’s scheme for converting
the S.A. public debt looks unpromising. By far the
biggest part of the debt falls due between 1907 and 1939,
and when the money-lern'er has got his 4 or 4J per cent,
safe for 30 years or so, it is useb ss to ask him to exchange
for a 3J per cent, slock on any terms which will he of the
slightest assistance to the borrower. The fooli.-h policy
of borrowing for fixed periods blocks the way, as usual.
If Australia floated its loans on the British principle
for 10 or 15 years certain, and thereafter to he repaid
at its own option on giving six months’ notice, it could
bang on when times are bad, and convert its 4 or 4$ per
sent, loans into 3 or 3i per cents, when the occasion is
suitable. This fact has struck every Australian Treasurer
like an avalanche during the last few months, hut all the
recent loans have been floated on the old fixed-dale prin-
ciple just the samel No Australian financier cares a
«t*aw about what will happen 10 or 15 years hence.

The London Statist mildly suggests that it
would be well for the British creditors to shove the other
Australian reconstructed banks into liquidation, after the
fashion of the City of Melbourne, and have done with the
business. Evidently that blatant organ forgets that the
"other hanks" have regularly paid up the interest agreed
upon, and have, so far, met the principal as it fell due,
aod a good deal of it before it was due, and under these
circumstances they would probably tell the British
creditor to go to perdition, or some such place, if he
proposed to liquidate them against their will.
• • • *
The British creditors of the City of Melbourne
Bank will probably feel very sorry before the liquidation
Is finished. If they had taken charge of the institution
U proposed, they would almost certainly have got 2J per
cent, on their money in the meantime, and with ahun-
iant patience they might have got it all hack in the long
ran. Now they will probably realise 10s. in the f, and
the highest interest at which they can invest it in England
Is Just about 2J per cent. The bank-rate on deposits in
England is now something like 1 per cent., and the City of
Uelb., at its worst, would have given a lot more than that.

Last week it was suddenly announced, for the
fourth time in its recent history, that the Bank cf New
Zealand was tottering on the verge of disaster, and it lias
been decided that the Government must again come to
the rescue. The adventures of this mistrably unlucky
bank within the last seven years make interesting read-
ing. In 1887 it had a paid-up capital of £1,000.000 ami an
tileged reserve of 1600,000. In 'BB it wrote off the whole
reserve and £300,000 of capital to cover losses, making
6900,000 of the shareholders’ money gone in one aet. The
jecond reconstruction followed a year or two later, when
£300,000 more was written off, making a total loss to the
lhareholders of £1,200,000; and £500,000 fresh capital
was called tip. At the same time the hank's landed pro-
perty was formed into a nominally separate concern—the
B.N.Z. Estates Co. —but as the B.N.Z. held all the shares
in this ill-fated concern, the separation was only nominal.
Also the estates were pawned in England to raise
61,335,000, on terms which actually amounted to 6 per
jent. The third great hurst came along in '94, when the
Jeddon Government saved the bank from closing its
joors by guaranteeing an advance of £2,000,000 at 4 per
jent. Another £750,000 was borrowed in London at
the same rate to pay off a similar amount of the 6 per
jent. mortgage on the estates, and it was reported that it
night be necessary to write off another £300,000 to cover
inore losses. Also, the Government auditors insisted on
mother call of £500,000, and thereafter people hoped
that the unhappy B.N.Z. was at last really and truly over
its difficulties.
The fourth great smash eventuated quite sud-
Jsnly last week. A Parliamentary committee investi-
gat-d the condition of the Estates Co. and reported a
•hortage of £1,340,000, for which the 8.N.Z., as the sole
shareholder, is responsible. The committee also, accord-
ing to the cabled report, speaks of a defi iency of
£376,000, and a possible further deficiency of £200,000, in
the bank owing to more depreciation in the \alue of the
assets. This will absorb all the remaining paid up capital
Dl £900,000, all the £450,000 which is expected to be the
net result of the call, and will involve another call of at
least £600,000 to give the institution a fresh start. The
total less to the shareholders since 1887 will then be some-
where between £2,600,000 and £3,000,000.
It is now proposed that Govt, should take up
£600,000 worth of preference shares; that when the
existing losses of the Estates Co. are provided for the
State should guarantee any further deficiencies, which
practically amounts to taking over the hank’s properties ;
and that the bank should then make a fresh start for the
fourth time, and try to keep square for the future. If
tills scheme is carried out Govt, will practically own five-
sixths of the bank, or possibly a good deal more, so that
the attempt to keep it going as a private institution
might as well be abandoned. A private bank which is
almost wholly conducted by State ollicials, and which get#
five-sixths of its capital under a State guarantee, is an
anomaly anyhow. Meanwhile, the notes of the B.N.Z.
have been declared legal tender throughout Maoriland, in
Order to prevent any sudden rush on its resources. The
bunk has paid about £2,500,000 in divs. during the 34
years of its existence, so the disasters of the last seven
years have swallowed practically all the profits of its long
career. Still, taking it all round, the B.N.Z. has had
unusual luck. If it had been wound up when its
troubles began to he apparent in ’B7, it would have
probably made a smash very like that of Matthew
Davies’ Mercantile, or the situ llftil Federal, or the V.D.L.
As it is, the directors have managed to break the news
by instalments, and have quiet'd the public eacli time a
new disaster came along with the assurance that the
worst was now over. Any desire there might be to kill
the original management has thus evaporated through
sheer effluxion of time. One thing, however, is certain:
the Slate’s £2,000,000 guarantee may yet involve a
serious liability if the calls prove very hard to collect,
or if more losses turn up, and Maoriland will have to risk
some more money in propping up its big bank in order to
safeguard the money it has risked already.
» • • •
During the discussion in Maoriland Parliament
on the 13.N.Z. reconstruction bill, it was again proposed
to make that institution a Slate Hank. Proposal rejected
bv 45 voles to 17. The B.N.Z. is already a State Bank, in
so far as the State has all the worry and responsibility,
and finds most of the money, and takes most of the risk ;
yet the Seddon Government is too much scared to curry
the matter to its only logical conclusion.

The balance-sheet of the Land Mortgage Bank
of Victoria is a remarkable document in several respects.
The total loss for the half-year is £6617. The reseive
fund of £105,000 has disappeared, and at least £60,000 of
it sec ms to have been already used to meet losses. The
bank’s investments amount to a tiifle over £1,000,000,
and though the chairman admitted that a lot of interest
had been written off as irre overahle, he frankly statid
that, nothing had been written <ff the principal, which
stood in every cise at the “ hook value.” How far that
may differ from the real value no one knows, but. when
the interest, is irrecoverable it often happens that a lot of
the principal is gone also. Moreover, it has been found
advisable to square the accounts by inserting among the
assets, “conversion expenses, £22,500.” This, so f>r as
appears from the chairman’s explanation, is not cash or
property of any kind, but is a sum which the bank might
have had to pay under certain circumstances, and ns these
circumstances didn’t turn up it hadn’t to he paid, there-
fore it is set down as being on hand instead. Unless the
explanation is wrongly reported this sounds very much
like saying that the chairman might have been run over
in Collins-st.reet ami damaged to the extent of £lOOO, and
as he wasn’t run over he has a right to insert the
£lOOO as an asset in his private balance-sheet. The Land
Mortgage Bank proposes to ask for a reduction of interest
on its £900,000 worth of 4j per cent, debentures, and it
is obvious that it needs something of the kind badly, and
needs a lot of it. Also, a good-sized call is suggested by
director Pratt, M.L.C.

The now liquidating Australian Mutual Invest-

report dat- d 28th July reveals a di-astrous state of

so that, the loss will fall heaviest on the small thrifty
person who wants a big interest for his savings. During
the half-year the realisation on properties and official
expenses hasincr ased the debit balance fr m £99,561 to
£172,531 caused principally by mortgagees foreclosing
on allegedly valuable city properties. Taking these
figures as they stand, it follows that if the liquidator
have extraordinary luck, and realise on all the assets at
their own valuation—which they probably won’t—the co.
would pay about 9s. 9d. in the £, exdus ; ve of sale and
other expenses. By a series of calculations, the liquida
tors themselves show that they might, under various
circumstances, pay Bs. 3d., 35., or 2s. 91d. in the £.

The National Mutual Life Assurance Society
has issued a table of half-premium rales. Under this
system a person who wants to get the largest amount of
insurance for the smallest immediate outlay can pay half
the usual rates for the first five years, after which the
ordinary premium is payable. To any peison who is tem-
porarily in financial straits this system is exceedingly
useful, as it enables him to get a large insurance f r a
very small present cost; in other words, it is another
embodiment of the great principle of shunting ihe re-
sponsibility on to the morrow. The National Mutual is a
local institution, managed by its policy-holders, where all
Ihe profits go to the insurers, and it claims the credit of
being the first office to b troduce Ihe system of keeping
overdue policies in force out of surrender values, whether
the insured ri quests that this be done nr not. As the
average insurer hasn’t sufficient presence of mind to look
after the matter, this automatic system—now common in
all Australian offices—is a far greater boon than it may
appear.
If Queensland’s Government gets safely through

capable man to be found in the Sodom and Gomorrah of
Queensland politics, and the Nelson Government will put
him in charge of the institution, and will inaugurate the
new departure by a full slati ment of the bank’s position,
then the idea is wholly commendable. Any big local
institution which can be nursed into solvency should be
preserved, if only to prevent the English banks getting a
bigger hold on the business of the country than they
already possess, and with State support even the Q.N.
Bank should get through all right. But the Queensland
Government is < tie very worst one in Australia to under-
take such a work. The lijst time it showed any signs of

For the week ended Aug. 23, COfiO tons of
Broken Hill sulphide ore were eoncentrated, shipped in
the crude state, or smelted. This is the re< ord to date.
Block 14 during the week put 2315 tons through ils en-
larged concentrating plant—the record for any single
mine.
After almost everybody who believes official
reports had settled down to the belief that, the fire in the
B. H. Proprietary’s block 11 was out, and after that plea-
sant belief had remained undisturbed for a fortnight, the
news is conveyed in a halting fashion that smoke con-
tinues to issue from the crevices at the bottom and along
the sides of the open-cut. At the moment of w riting it is
impossible to say whether there is still fire under-
ground or whether the carbonic acid gas, which
has latterly been introduced at another point, is forcing
out some smoke front parts which the gas had not before
readied. Most likely, however, there is still fire in the
mine. Several subsidences have occurred lately, and
these appear to have afforded fresh ventilation arid thus
given the embers another lease of life.
What is really causing the trouble in connection
with this Are at Broken Hill is the existence of the huge
quarry or open-cut, the bottom of which is amOngat the
timbers, rendering: the absolute cutting off of air and
vents almost impossible. When the system of square-set
timbering with Oregon was introduced it was never ex-
pected that the timbers would be exposed in this way ; so,
that, although this does hot improve the case for the
system, it removes the responsibility from the dead
Pulton’s shoulders, upon which some have placed it.
A correspondent:—Much more than a month
ago Manager Stewart expressed his conviction that the
fire was out, and the occasional whiffs of smoke
from crevices in the open-cut floor were explained
as having been liberated from underground cavities.
Physicists do not favor the theory. Smoke, it
is said, would not long retain its form under such circum-
stances ; bottle some for a week and see. The old proverb
that “ where there’s smoke there’s fire ” is substantially
correct.
Many people regarded all the efforts to put out
the tire, except the gas-application at which the manage-
ment long hesitated, as practically wasted. Water is
notoriously useless for combating mine-fires, unless abso-
lute flooding is possible. The blasting operations, to fill
up ttie cracks in the floor of the open-cut, and so
“smother” the fire, probably did no good. But the gas
was hound in time to succeed ; the only difficulty was
that it was impossible to fill the mine with gas above a
certain level, and above this the fire might continue to
burn—as it evidently has.
One of the chief points of difference between the
new and the old management of the Proprietary mine
was on the question of output. Manager Howell kept the
reduction of the limited smelting ores going at breakneck
speed, and though 15 smelters at the mine and five at
Port Pine were running, three more were leased (at £75
per week rental) from the British Co. Manager Stewart
has all along been desirous of putting on the brake—an
operation which needed to be approached circumspectly.
So that, whether the fire is found in the end to have
materially curtailed the smelting-ore supply or not, no
one expects to see the whole 23 furnaces rtinning again.
It was the 15 mine furnaces which were closed down when
the fire started, and the “south nest,” w'here the gas-
generating operations were conducted, is still idle.

with its sulphides. Last week 580 tons crude, assaying
17oz. silver and 28 per cent, lead, produced 140 tons con-
centrates, worth 65 per cent, lead and silver—
besides seconds and slimes. Block 14 got 698 tons con-
centrates from 2229 tons crude, with good silver and lead

2J miles S.W. of the Great Boulder, wLh assays going up

find for fIOO, there seems to be more Kalgoor than lie

The Earl of Donoughmore, Chairman of the

comfort to his shareholders. He said that "shortly,
owing to the unhealthy situation of Coolgardie, the people
may ; be expected to move out en ina*se on to the

The Rutherglen district of Victoria is un-
doubtedly a big alluvial field. The North Prentice Co.,
On Main and Prentice leads, will be raising washdirt very
sorin—and so will the Great Southern co. as soon as
water difficulty is mastered. Several other cat’s are sink-
ing shafts for bore-proved gold-bearing wash.

“Corowa,” writes a Bulletin correspondent,
“ will be the alluvial gold-field of N.S.W., as nearly all the
Rulherglen leads pass under the Murray into N.S.W.,
north of Corowa. The writer got splendid’ gold prospects
out of bores last year two miles from Corowa. The pros-
pect was the best he has ever got of gold from a bore

According to Under-Sec. for Mines Sellheim,
Clermont is now the largest and most profitable alluvial
field in Queensland, employing 1100 men. The same
authority gives the share value of Charters Towers at the
end of ’94 as £2,155,000, against £1,340,000 in ’93; and
divs. for the year equalled 21 per cent, on capital.

Dear Bulletin,— Re the C.Q. G.M. Proprietary
at Calliope. Didn’t Dunn go up to inspect the pro-
perly? Why wasn’t his report published? The bank-
manager is made to say that 280,0000 z. gold were taken
out of N.Z. Gully in 12 months. 1 think about 20j000oz.
would be a big order. Queensland didn’t produce that
amount of gold in ’64—the year N.Z.O. was working,
though Peak Downs (a much larger and richer field) was
in full swing. Hickson and Rolls solemnly declare that
the whole gully will go 6dwt. to the load worked on a
face. H’m ! Plenty of the gully was worked for 4or
sdwt. to the load, taking from 9in. to a foot of wash.
Seems we were sinking through the good dirt to get at the
poor! It starved every one out of it long before it was
selected. There were plenty of “puddlers” on the look-
out for poor ground, and if it would have shaped up to.
Idwt. per load there wouldn’t be a yard of it left.
Manager Larkins says Jdwt. to the load will pay well for
sluicing. So it would—and if the Jdwt. had been there
the water would have been put on it 25 years ago.
What do the promoters consider a fair trial for reefs?
Spicer, Dunn, Tom Brown, Watson and Co., with a five-
stamp battery and Chilian mill, stuck to them for nearly
two years—as long as they could make anything. Arid
since I left, the local people—Kiikman, Stoney,.and
otheiw—have given them another trial; but they all had
to gi\> it best. I reckon the N.Z. Gully reefs a very poor
show in a poor reefing district. No bar, beach, or point
in the Boyne River has ever been worked, and no gully
carrying gold has ever been traced into it, so far as I
know. The gold in N.Z. Gully runs out nearly two miles
before it junctions with the Boyne. Anyone who has had
any experience in river-work would naturally conclude
that if the shallow ground was no good, the deep was
worth leaving alone. I believe the prospects that have
been got in the top drift to be due to batteiy, cradle, tom
and sluice tailings and hopperings. By the way, wasn’t
the 340 z. slug got on the “ Eastern Boyne ’’—miles away
from the co.’s claim? Mr. Sachs says “Old Miner” leaves
out of consideration the profits to be derived from dredg-
ing, beyond giving a contemptuous sniff at ’em. Well, 1
reckon he can put’em in a wine-glass and cover’em up
with a gooseberry-leaf. Matter of opinion, of course
That’s mine.— Another Old Q. Mccrsiiiftbr.

“Joseph of Canaan ” has evidently struck
the underlying piety of Sydney, for business is
better at Her Majesty’s than it lias been for many
months past. Tne said business, however, looks
very unlike the usual variety; it consists mainly
of murky females in black frocks, and with their
hair combed straight back from their horny fore-
heads, and men with monkey beards and those
badly-fitting clothes which are a sign of grace
within. The whole establishment, in fact, bears
the appearance of a vast prayer - meeting.
“Joseph of Canaan” is notable chiefly for its
serious aspect and its redness. A reddish Joseph
is sold, by ten red, bad brethren, into a red land
of Egypt, and bis ten red brethren, and his old
red father, follow him there and are left high in
the favor of a bright-red Pharaoh. Joseph, who
grows redder and redder as the years pass over
his head, marries a noble-hearted red wife, after
poor old Potiphar, a stately brick-colored hero,
has died of a broken-heart. Potiphar’s wife, who
is only light-brown, repents in the last act, and
becomes a better woman, and disappears in charge
of a glaring red officer and some troops who are
the color of blood. There is no trace of comedy
in “Joseph;” if the idea of making brother
Zebulnn a funny man occurred to the author,
he promptly suppressed it, and all the
brethren are profoundly and desperately serious.
So is everybody else, and the awful Egyptian
lack of humour grows oppressive. The play con-
sists very largely of intervals, and when it is
actually in motion about half of it is processions
of priests and dancing-girls, and magnificent
scenery, and “Joseph” himself —all there is of
him—could be easily compressed into two hours.
If this were done there would be time to finish up
with the orie-act play of “Jonah and the Whale,”
with George Rignold as Jonah, and Scot Inglis as
the Whale, and Plimmer as the converted popula-
tion of Nineveh, or the Deluge, or the fall of
Jerusalem, or some other Scriptural character.
# • *
One of the most remarkable features of
‘-‘Joseph,” by the way, is the vigorous manner in
which Potiphar’s wife gives “ back-talk ” to
Pharaoh when that
capable monarch is
seated on his throne.
Pharaoh can hardly
get a word in edgewise
owing to the interrup-
tions of this aggressive
person—which hardly
accords with the
general impression of
the Egyptian poten-
tates of old, who are
generally believed to
have impaled anyone
who even breathed too
loud when the king was
offering a few remarks.
Which reminds The
Bulletin that Mr.
Rignotd is to have a
benefit tendered to him
by his many Sydney
friends on the 10 th
inst., that being the
eighth anniversary of
his lesseeship at Her
Majesty’s.

Prof. Kennedy, the
mesmerist, who opened
on Saturday night, at
Sydney School of Arts,
hasn’t changed visibly
since he infested Syd-
ney a good ipany years
ago. His show hasn’t
changed, either. He
calls for subjects from
the audience in the
same old way, and an
exactly similar crowd
of seedy-looking pati-
ents bolt for the plat-
form. They are put
“under the influence,”
ami proceed to fall with
sickening thuds on their
heads, or their teeth,
or their ears, or with
their feet on top of
other patients' heads,
and to lie helplessly
about the stage in all
directions. The pro-
fessor then sticks
)arge darning-needles
jnto them, or sits on
them to show their rigidity, and makes them fall
out of imaginary balloons, and drink horrible con-
coctions of kerosene and the like, which are
alleged to be whisky, and otherwise make a
grotesque-;and hideous display of themselves in
several dozen ways. The show on Saturday night
attracted the biggest and most enthusiastic audi-
ence which could be compressed into the hall, yet
it was a coarse, brutal and purposeless exhibition,
none the less. The spectacle of dozen presumably
intelligent human beings made to surrender their
manhood to a fat showman, and reduced below
the mental level of the ape, is tolerably sickening
at any time. The average man doesn’t amount to
much at the best, but when he is persuaded that
he is an infant and howls in a cradle with a feed-
ing-bottle in his hand, and otherwise plays the
inebriated monkey lor the public amusement, he
is a show that should make any audience feel a
desire to escape from the hall and get something
to calm the upheaval in its stomach. But the
audience doesn’t bolt—any more than it would
from a hanging, or a man-and-dog fight, or an ear-
chewing match between two hulking pugilists, or
a Saturday night “scrum ” in a back street when
two drunken women are trailing each other around
by the hair and hitting each other’s heads with
beer-pots. The Bulletin drops the subject ju-t
here lest it should be betrayed into making some
severe and well-deserved remarks about the pro-
fessor. It never yet met a showman who deserved
them more thoroughly than does that hard-faced
personage.
** * *
The farther deliverances of the Countess
Wacbtmeister in Sydney haven’t thrown any
special light on the murky ways of Theosophy.
The most that can be gathered from her utter-
ances is that her creed is divided into two parts
which have no visible connection with each other.
One half of it is a beautiful doctrine of toleration,
brotherly love, and universal peace. The other
half consists of the astounding fish stories of the
’"lamented Blavatsky about certain very old and
useless men who moon away theirexistence in oaves
in a land so remote that hardly anyone can go there
to discover their absence, and who seem to do
nothing but sit hard down in a hairy and un-
kempt condition and be ineffably wise and wholly
uncomfortable. There is no visible connection
between the doctrine of brotherly love and these
alleged troglodytes, but the believer is expected
to take them all together. If Protestantism were
built on the same plan it would also consist of two
equal parts, the first being a belief in the New
Testament gospel, and the second a firm convic-
tion that John Huss could eat 144 hard-boiled
eggs at a meal without any bad effects. And
when one comes to think over it, Protestantism
is built on that same plan, or one very like it. The
Bulletin cheerfully subscribes to the thin end of
Theosophy—the end with the brotherly love and
the universal peace in it. But it lias serious
doubts about the thick end, which sets forth that
Mine. Blavatsky was supernaturally guided by a
mysterious Indian over 7ft. high, and which con-
tains the stories about the ancient seers who vege-
tate in Thibet, and the writings which drop down
from unseen hands. The trouble about the thick
end of every creed is that the miracles never com''
to convince you unless you believe already, n>•<’
then you aren’t in a condition to investigate (h •

if they do come. Even the believer, however,
seldom sees anything; all he gets is the Copntess
Wachtmeister’sassurance that Madame Blavatsky
told the hairy old Colonel Olcott that she saw
something.

Dudley Wyatt, the calculating boy, is the
newest sensation at Sydney Empire. In his own
dreary art this very small youth—he seems to be
seven or thereabouts—is truly remarkable. He
can mentally add up, subtract, multiply, and
divide, huge sums that run into billions in a few
seconds, and can tackle mountains of fractions
and decimals almost in a breath. Nothing in the
way of figures comes amiss to him ; anyone who
wants to know how long it will take a man to go

That airy nothing, “ Gentleman Joe,” will
be performed for the last time at Sydney Lyceum
on Friday, and Saturday begins another six-nights’
season of “In Town,” After that, the “ Gaiety,
Girl’’ will be resurrected to till the brief remainder
of the season. The management is probably well-
advised in thus arranging things, for “Gentleman
Joe” is too weak to hold its own for any
lengthened period. It is a well-meaning produc-
tion, but it suffers from advanced tuberculosis of
the libretto, or something of the kind, and the
best thing for it is complete rest.

“The Judge” will be slaged at Sydney
Criterion next Saturday, when Elton will appear
as the eminent judicial functionary who is sur-
prised by a bigamous female whde in the act of
washing his feet, and led into sundry situations
utterly ruinous to his dignity. The Cri. has done
excellent business for the last four weeks, and the
palmy days of the B. and B. ret/ime appear to
have returned for good under Lohr’s able manage-
ment.

“ Ma Mie Rosette ” revived itself at Melb.
Princess’s, on Saturday, with a good deal of the
original success. Nellie Stewart has departed,
but the opera remains as intrinsically naughty as
before. It exhales the same spicy perfume of un-
hallowed love, old associations cling to the catchy
melodies, and Brownlow’s regal legs stand where
they did. Miss May Pollard, who has many a
time fallen into Nellie’s characters, and always
fallen gracefully, is a very likeable Rosette. Her
stride is somewhat pngey : she hasn’t the florid
Gothic innocence of Nellie’s rustic manner in the
first act, but her dream of what might happen to
a damsel, after bringing fresh milk to the king’s
chateau every evening for three months, is forci-
bly interpreted by May Pollard. Also, she has
the courage to sit upon the chateau stair-
case and sing “I Was Dreaming,” the loud
encore which she wins for that hackneyed
ballad being more than well-deserved, under
the circumstances. Another change from the
first cast of "Ma Mie Rosette” is Miss
Nash, as modest Martha who knows a lot. The
new Martha’s dance with Lauri brought down
the house on Saturday, and went far to explain
why she had already planted three hu-bands.
She must have rushed ’em into early giaves.
Brownlow, Tapley, and Howard Vernon each
takes up his part in the familiar style of yore, and
Corisandre improves on her previous work. Just
now Miss Young is singing equal to two ordinary
artists. She gets no good solo opportunity in this
opera, but her voice is particularly valuable all
the same.
• • •
On Saturday they will set up “ Ma’mzelle
Nitouche,” supplemented by a one-act musical
comedy, in place of the Living Pictures that used
to HU up the programme. The title of the novelty
is “An Arcadian Eve,” and it is “ by Alfred
Plumpton.” If Plumpton wrote the book as well
as the music, the Eve ought to be an entertaining
young woman.
** * *
The last profit of Bland Holt’s wondrous
season at Melbourne Royal is “The Prodigal
Daughter,” a drama which, besides being almost
reasonable, is full of that noble animal, the ’orse.
In fact, there is so much horseflesh and stable in
the plot that the erring daughter seems of very
little consequence. She comes back to the dear
old home in the final act, and stands concealed at
the rear of her venerable dad, whilst he pretends
not to know that she is there, but nobody would
feel hurt if the young woman died abroad, and
sent a few parting words to her family by post.
Bland Holt and joyous Mrs. B.H. are the most
interesting figures in this entertainment. The
manager is a head lad of shaky principles who
feels tempted to nobble the favorite for five
hundred quid, but becomes commendably honest
when he can’t very well help himself, and the
lady is a frisky quakeress. Walter Baker is less
convincing than usual. He gives the audience to
understand that he has gone off to ride the
favorite, or break his neck, and he even presents
himself after the race as the winning jockey.
Yet, in the meantime, an unknown hero, who
weighs, at a guess, fully four-stone less than
Walter, has been seen taking the water-jump in
Walter’s colors. There is some mystery here
winch the drama doesn’t clear up. Miss
Elizabeth Watson’s appearance as the prodigal
daughter is disappointing, after her more
natural acting in “Saved from the Sea.” Then
she suggested her sister Henrietta to some
extent. Possibly an attempt to improve upon
that suggestion is responsible for her entire losp
of resemblance to her clever relative. Miss E.
Watson’s voice, as it happens, is a gloomy remin-
der of the dirge introduced to Australia a while
ago by Miss Mabel Hardy (of the Dacre Go.).

Saturday matinee shows, at Melb. Opera
House, were inaugurated last Saturday with a

übiquitous Acting-Gov. Madden kindly contri-

to keep its gates ajar, and the “b,oy” pianist of
the new concert combination, at the Town Hall,
seems to have lashed an unsympathetic city into a
state bordering on enthusiasm.

Proposals for building a new theatre in
Adelaide assume definite shape; the site fixed is on
North Terrace, in the centre of the city. Hudson,
the minstrel comedian, and Williamson are protni-
nent in the negotiations, but there is a difficulty
through the heavy terms demanded by the owner
of the freehold.

The British consumer is in doubt as to
whether exported Australian meats undergo
proper examination. S.M. Herald
rushes to the rescue by asserting that there is no
cause for alarm, as it finds that the exported
article is subject to the same sanitary regulations
as “that killed for our own use.” A stranger
walking through Sydney would belittle impressed
with the community’s daintiness. He would find
everywhere meat exposed outside of butchers’
shops, and overhanging the filthy pavements—a
vigorous salesman, with a broom possibly, stirring
up the dust to insure its due incorporation with
chops and steaks, the while some subject of bron-
chitis or consumption stood by and spat.
Last week, some Sydney cattle-salesmen,
charged with having sold cattle affected by tuber-
culosis, pleaded that the diseased animals had
been passed by the inspector, and that it was im-
possible, in most cases, to detect tuberculosis in
live beasts. The plea is a sound one—and is only
an argument for the close inspection and remorse-
less condemnation of every tnherculosed carcase.
The disease is clearly transmissible through meat
to human beings, and one affected bullock may be
the means of endowing with consumption a dozen
or 50 people. It will be well if the demand from
abroad for the scientific inspection of every carcase
intended for export, leads to inspection of every
ounce of meat wiiich is to pass into local consump-
tion—The Bulletin had almost written tuber-
culosis.

This time the Deeming blessing. After
the hero was hung, Miss liounsevell, who so
narrowly escaped being bis victim, tried life as a
barmaid in Broken Hill and as a milliner in
Temora (N.S.W.), and found it none too pleasant.
But the blessing was working. A former admirer,
now a prosperous Canadian citizen, bought “The
Last Confession of Deeming,” read of his old
'flame’s'‘peril, and thought many things. Result :
Mi-s Ronnsevell a few weeks ago accepted his

Dear Bulletin, —
What can be the good
of letting enthusiastic
yming correspondents—
possible 15-stoners after
five years of matrimony
write yon long letters
re the virtue of leanness
and the sinfulness of fat?
Cii cumstanees make
flesh, or prevent it from
corning. Occupation,
diet, domestic surround-
ings hick, Turkish baths,
many things may ac-
count for a man’s small
or great circumference.
The larrikin is the
leanest type I’ve ever
struck, and the up-
country Australian, as a
rule, is “ a high-strung,
virile, lean man,” be-
cause he rides much,
eats more meat than
vegetables or farinaceous
food, and ruins his
digestion with tea. Yet
there is nothing “strik-
ingly loveable” about
him. Arthur Orton was
never a fat man in Aus-
tralia. HewenttoEng-
lind and grew into a
phenomenal heap of
tissue. A thin, “soul-
ful ’’ shoemaker would
inevitably become fat
and “selfish” if begot
a billet in a brewery.—
Yours, Stout in Mode-
ration.

There is a good
deal in the Auckland
Women’s Liberal
League’s suggestion that
the C.D. Act be made
to apply to women and
men.
A Sydney newspaper correspondent ob-
.ects to the Philharmonic Society performing the
oratorio “ Mary Magdalen,” on the ground that
Mary isn’t fit to be introduced to respectable
people. Considering the unhappy fact that Mary
Magdalens are a positive necessity to monogamic
civilisation ; that chastity is inevitably nourished
on prostitution—the purity of shielded women
being only made possible by the sacrifice of the
shieldless to the sex-MoIoch; and that, conse-
quently, the prostitute is the greatest bulwark of
respectability, this is merely another illustration
of the fact that mealy mouths mean reeling brains
—as well as selfish instincts.

The case of Johnson, Mrs. Butler’s im-
prisoned brother, is slowly percolating through
the Silurian rocks of official ceremonial. As his
eventual release is beyond doubt, The Bulletin
suggests that he be let out at once on suspicion of
being innocent, while the forms are gone through
at leisure afterwards.

In view of everything which has occurred
lately in connection with the ill-luck of a certain
Judge—and the very remarkable ill-luck of those
tried before him —would it not be well to appoint
a Commission (one more or less would hardly
count) to re-try the whole of a certain class of
cases and review all sentences with which his
Honor has been associated—even, if necessary, to
revise all future ones ?

There will have to be a commission of
inquiry into the Snffield case. Sn(field was con-
victed before Judge Windeyer and sentenced to
10 years’ imprisonment on a charge of attempted
rape at Newcastle, N.S.W. From first to last
Snffield, a most intelligent young man of previously
excellent character, strenuously protested his
innocence. There is more than one plausible
theory, utterly at variance with the Crown case,
as to the real facts of the matter; and at New-
castle, where all the parties are best known, it is
widely believed that a terrible injustice has been
done. In a few days there will reach the N.S.W.
Minister of alleged Justice a petition signed by
many thousands of persons for a commission of
inquiry.
The one really interesting feature in that
recent Sydney libel-case was the story which the
benevolent Michael Menser told in the witness-
box. According to that gentleman’s explanation,
Lipman owed him a good deal of money. Lipman
was in difficulties, and wanted more money.
Therefore, Menser sent two young lady relatives
round to collect subscriptions for “a distressed
LOVE'S YOUNG DREAM.
MAY (annoyed): “ When I get married, I won't have any boys!”
CECIL : “ I don't care! When I get married, I'll have a bicycle!"
Jewish family,” on the understanding that their
’bus-fares, lunches, and other expenses—estimated
at 20 per cent, of the entire takings—came out of
the receipts m the first place; that Menser got
h ,ab the balance until his debt was paid off ; and
£‘l at Lipman got what was left. Consequently,
Menser appealed to a charitable public to pay up
tbe ad d ®bt owing to him by his reduced relative.
Further, he swarmed into the witness-box and
explained the whole circumstances quite cheer-

that Menser is an “ insurance and general agent ”
MpUms this. Few things are so destructive to

Accordingly they summoned his wife before the
court, and cross-examined her for nearly an hour
as to the lost one’s whereabouts, but all to no pur-
pose. “I don’t know where my husband is,” was
the substance of her answers; “I never hear from
him or of him. I don’t believe he’s in Victoria.
I don’t believe he’s in Australia. I don’t believe
he’s anywhere.” “ Yes,” said Judge Molesworth ;
“ the best witness for a man is his wife or his sweet-
heart.” Which is true in a sense. But the worst
witness against a man is also his wife or his sweet-
heart—or his mother-in-law, or his unmarried
aunt, or his hysterical daughter, or his elder sister,
or the woman next door.

Doctors talk of an awful awakening in
store for the festive D’isy and her husband who
start married life on a bicycle built for two. By
the same token, there seems to be a possibility of
Parliament passing a law in the dim future, pro-
hibiting the banns between Angelina and any
member of a wheelman’s league. Which seems a
matter for little Angy to take to heart imme-
diately. The other day a young married couple
of companion bikists went to a Melb. physician
with a tale of nuptial woe, which they, in their
innocence, had reckoned unique. The confidential
adviser undeceived them as to the supposed singu-
larity of their case. He told them of three other
unhappy pairs who were suffering from the same
affliction. Moreover, he anticipates a steady
rush of muscular Christian husbands to his con-
sulting-room anon, when they shall have attained
the age of 35 or thereabouts, and found that the
patent pneumatic rolling machine has unwrung
their withers beyond recall, so to speak. This
medicine man foresees a great decline in local
production as the result of bicycles. His pre-
scription for the two patients aforesaid is worth
mentioning. He ordered them to discard their
bike, and advised them to give it to some poor,
struggling couple whose family had already
exceeded the limits of prudence.

There are 30 J’s.P. in Carlton (Melb.),
and ye 1 wlvu a batch of prisoners was trotted
into the local court, the other day, there was not
a single magistrate available. The police rushed
round hunting justices, but had no luck; so
accused were solemnly marched back to gaol,
where, however, the prevailing authority refused
to accommodate them without remand-warrants
signed by a P.M. or a J.P. Then the hunt began
afresh, and, finally, one of the great unpaid was
roped in, and the prisoners were gaoled pending
the convenience of the cheap and nasty magis-
tracy. It is now quite understood in Melbourne
suburbs that the law holds every man guilty pend-
ing the convenience of the J.P. Honorary magis-
trates are too dear at the price.

Speaking of the late vice-gubernatorial
fancy-dress ball, the Argus said :
Mr. Frank Madden made a glorified British yokel, the
sort of person who is put on the land and stops there
without wanting to come into town and he a railway-
porter.
The Argus means to convey to the bothersome
village settlers of Victoria the idea that they
should go to “Gov’mint ’Ouse,” and see a large,
fleshy man, who never dug mud in his life, philan-
dering round, to learn what a decorous tiller of
the soil ought to be.

them, but not in one issue.

The Austral Salon is working hard for the
Vic. artists’ carnival. Gifts of flowers, ferns,
lattice porches, carpentry work for stalls, cigars
and sweets have been promised to the persuasive
Salonites. Now and then difficulties occur. One
was with artist Ford, who had mapped out a com-
plete scheme of costume and scenery. One stall
was to be a garden where refreshments were to be
sold by comic-opera peasant girls in short skirts
and red stockings. But, unfortunately, the ladies
running this are married and matronly in propor-
tion. They objected to the skirts and stockings,
and though Ford battled hard for his elaborate
costume-scheme it had to be modified. But the
man who runs up a back-lane when he sees a
Salonite approaching is George Gordon. The
poor fellow at a meeting—mostly consisting of
the aforesaid matronly ladies—hastily remarked
that he hoped “ the younger and more energetic
ladies would interest themselves,” &e. It was
particularly unfortunate, because the energy and
enthusiasm has been with all the weight-for-age
members. The consequent horrible silence and
stony glare of 20 outraged dames paralysed
George, his legs gave way, and he dropped back
into his seat.

“ Lottie Collins on the one hand, and the
starving seamstress on the other, are the two poles
of our city civilisation,” says Labouchere :
It is cabled that the French army in
Madagascar is getting very near to the capital,
and that the missionaries in that city have nobly
refused to retire with the retreating Hovas, “ pre-
ferring to die at their post.” This sounds large
and noble and gorgeous, but as the French army
isn’t likely to kill any missionaries—it is much
more probable, in fact, that the officers will invite
them to dinner and fill them with good liquor
the self-sacrifice isn’t worth cabling about. If the
missionaries retreated along with their flocks they
would have a lot of hard walking to do, and would
have to leave their furniture behind them, and
would probably get killed at last in some casual
scrimmage, or take fever, or otherwise come to
grief. So they wisely remain behind in their
comfortable quarters and cable that they are
‘‘dying at their post.” And if The Bulletin
was a missionary, and had the alternative of
waiting to take omelettes, Benedictine and coffee
witli a hospitable invader, or retreating through a
trackless forest with its old sermons in its tail-
pocket, it would do the exact same.

A Buenos Ayres correspondent writes to
WALTZ TIME.
[FOR THE BULLETIN. ]
A dance of dreams floats idly from the band
In a rich ball-room. He among the guests
Whose very presence all her soul invests
With subtle majesty of vague command,
Drifts with her darkly to a shadow land
Of ghosts who spoil the freshness of fair breasts.
His pleading eyes preferring strange behests
Thrill through her, and the magic of his hand.
The waltz ends, but her pulse beats madly on.
In time to surging strains of passion song,
His lying tongue has whispered in her ears,
And purpose sweet-voiced, slaying slender years,
Sweeps her in seas of ecstacy along
Into a grey night’s endless horizon.

You damn all women as wantons or worse
For a lover proved false in the days gone by.
There are women to worship as well as to curse—
And vows will break while the sun rides high !
Had you never a sister who held your hand
As you loitered together in Babyland,
Who guided your steps to the brightest bowers
Where the life-dawn flushed on the fairest flowers ?
Had you never a mother who heard you lisp
Your baby prayers at her dear old knee
Before Love’s flame like a will-o’-the-wisp
Had lured you away to the storm-tossed sea?
Had you never a lover—before this last—
True to the dream ere the dream had passed ;
Never a token—a tress or a curl —
To bind your life to one true-heart girl ?
Yon damn all women as wantons or worse
For a lover proved false in the days gone by,
Say, was the blame of it—all of it —hers ?
We are not so immaculate, you and I !

charge of “ grog,” recalls to a Bulletin correspon-
dent aS. A. incident of about five years ago. “An
Irish lady said to me: ‘You are a great friend
of the Commissioners’. The boys have lost their
places and I want you to get them put on again.’
I found that ‘ the boys ’ had been in charge of a
goods-train which had failed to put in an appear-
ance in reasonable time. The stationmaster grew
anxious, as a passenger-train would be shortly
along, so he dispatched a man on a tricycle, who
picked up the train eight miles distant. Seeing
no one about he climbed on board ; a bottle and a
pannikin were vertical, but the men were hori-
zontal and sound asleep. He roused them up and
started them off. At the enquiry their excuse
was that they had.pulled up the train to have a
smoke and presumed that in the heat of the
weather they had fallen asleep. Discharge re-
sulted. ‘Well,’ I said, ‘I consider that they
thoroughly deserved it.’ ‘Not at all, she re-
plied, ‘ if they had 'gone on they should have had
dismissal —for there might have been an accident;
but they should have been commended and not dis-
missed for their prudence in stopping.’ ”

Pastor Bevan, of Melbourne, asks, apropos
of the Chinese massacres, “Where would England
be to-day if it were not for her missionaries ? ”
Nobody answered—people are not allowed to
answer in church, by the way—so it is taken as
conclusively proved ■ that England is now in a
desirable situation not very well defined; that but
for its missionaries it wouldn’t be there, but some-
where else also not very well defined; and that in
order to retain England where it is, wherever that
may be, and prevent it going to the other place,
wherever that may be, it is necessary to
keep the missionary craze going with energy.
All the same, there is no logic in the
kind of argument which consists in wav-
ing one’s arms in the air, and asking where
something would have been but for something
else, and what would have become of the thing
that is if the thing had been that wasn’t.
“Where would England be if it were not for her
missionaries ?” Where would Gladstone’s high
collar be if the British had been licked at
Waterloo? Where would Parkes’s baby Cobden
be if Dibhs had assaulted Julius Ctesar at New
York? Where would anything be, for that
matter, if it wasn’t there, or if something else was
absent ?

At a R.C. church bazaar held the other
day in South Melbourne, one of the side-shows
was a tug-of-war between six priests and six
lawyers. The lawyers were never in it; the six
priests simply gave one mighty heave and dragged
the legal men all over the place like a bit of meat
on the end of a string. The average lawyer hasn’t
much muscle these times—he is worn out with
waiting for the client who never comes, and with
the haunting dread of becoming a “Gent one.”
Meanwhile the priest prospers very much as of
old. So long as Gehenna keeps in good blazing
order the church will never want, and when the
average father takes the end of a rope in his two
big hands, and hangs the weight of his brawn on
to it, he is equal to three ordinary attorneys or
even more.

A picture : the disappointed surgeon. A

extremely delicate and urgent operation to per-

chance of recovery. The operation was per-
formed with remarkable speed and machine-
like precision, and when the cutting, sewing and
bandaging were done, the great medico began to
glow with pride at having accomplished
another masterpiece. Suddenly he darted at the
patient, raised her head, and endeavored to force
brandy between her set teeth. “ Drink, woman,
drink ! ” he cried fiercely. But at that moment
the woman died. Letting the head fall roughly,
the artist flung himself out of the room mutter-

Judges composed N.S.W.
Full Court on Friday
week. Rev. James Clark,
of Kogarah, who was apply-

Privy Council, had been
seen in the train in a state
of high-wrought excite-
ment ; and some of his
fellow-passengers, fearing
trouble, had reported the
fact to the Judges. The
information made them
noticeably nervous. A
posse of tip-staffs was sta-
tioned behind the rev.
gentleman, two policemen
were ready for an emerg-
ency, and the most bellicose
of the Judges tempered ,his
usual roughness, and kept
himself well in the back-

Melbourne recently had a sensation which
would serve as a congenial text for Conan Doyle.
An old pensioner named Morrison, formerly
belonging to the Govt. Printing Office, was the
leading character. Morrison was a venerable
person of 70, and lived with a sister aged about
60. The sister disappeared one day, and about
the same time the pensioner apparently went off
his venerable head, and took to going about the
street with a jug of beer in his hand and his pants
worn wrong side to the front. This went on for
about a week, till at last a friend called on
him, and found him sitting on the bed with
his clothes on upside-down, smiling amiably at
things in general. He explained vacantly that
his sister had “been misled by another woman,’.
which, considering the lady’s age, seemed m
probable. Next evening the friend called agan
and found the decayed printer sitting in the same
condition, and still smiling amiably at things in
general, but apparently too far gone for explana-
tions. Then a search revealed the old womau
lying dead, in her nightdress, on the floor of an
adjacent room. So the authorities came along
and induced the ancient civil-servant to get into

At a recent meeting of Newtown (Sydney)
W.C.T.U., a Miss Pemell “gave a short address
from the words, ‘Why does a donkey prefer
thistles to oats?’” A Bulletin man, who has
been hypnotised by the W.C.T.U. “Superin-
tendent to Influence the Press,” supplies the
following answers : —(1) For the same reason that
a woman prefers hugging a sappy bachelor to
recording her vote for another woman’s husband.
(2) Because it is nicer to kill your own man with
bad cookery than it is to work slippers for a mar-
ried parson’s corns. (3) Because a donkey can
choose his own thistles, but he has to take any
oats that he can get. (4) Because a donkey
doesn’t prefer thistles to oats—especially wild
oats.

A year or two ago a Wellington (M.L.)
lady obtained a divorce, the court giving her
custody of her child. She married again. Then
she deserted her new husband, leaving the infant
behind her as a little item of flotsam which the
wave of matrimony had deposited at the second
old man’s door. The second husband hunted for
her to no purpose. Then he called on the first
husband and offered him the infant, but it was
rejected with contempt. Then he applied to the
magistrate, who refused to give an opinion. So
at last the step-father walked into the police-
station in broad daylight, and formally deserted
his encumbrance by leaving it on a bench, in order
to compel the police to sue him for maintenance
and get a legal decision on the matter. When last
heard from, the court was still struggling with the
case and getting no “forrarder.”
The only case at all like this which The Bul-
letin remembers is that of a Vic. farmer still
living. He married three times, and all his wives
died in quick succession. The first one left her
mother (a partially-blind old lady) on his hands.
The second bequeathed him a depressed maiden
aunt with a chronic cold, and he accepted her also
in a chastened spirit. And when the third was
dying she implored him to take in and provide for
her elderly half-sister, who was crippled by a
spinal affection, and the patriarch manfully took
her in also. He didn’t marry again, probably for
fear of having some more crippled old women
left on his hands, but the three look after his
house carefully and live harmoniously together,
and the grizzled fanner plants his potatoes cheer-
fully and acknowledges that things might be a lot
worse. x

My Dear Moorabinda—
Toe dressing in “Joseph of Canaan,” at Her
Majesty’s, is highly emotional. I have seen
nothies; so close to the knuckles as Maud William-
Bun’s flesh-pink temptation draperies in the second
act since Airs. Brown-Potter rushed out of the
t-mple of Sestos in a nightgown to rescue
Bellow, narrowly draped in a blue scarf. It is one
ot the cleverest simulations of startling sartorial
impropriety I have ever seen, and Miss William-
son (who has been playing impossibly virtuous
heroines up to this) deserves much praise for the
way she extracts every ounce of seductiveness out
of her clinging garments without any vulgarity
whatsoever. If a thing’s worth doing, by all
means do it well, and the way Mrs. Potiphar
coquets with her pink gauze shawl fluffed with
white swansdown makes the d.c. hold its breath—
as it most certainly should. The Potiphar scandal
was a very spicy on dit in its generation, and
there ou : jht to be a lot of promiscuous blushing
about the house when it’s reproduced as a tableau-'
vivant —that is, if the mummers know their biz.
Maud Williamson made a Bernhardtish-looking
Mrs. P., her narrow, expressive eyes being
most effective; but no actress on earth could-
make a great hit with 'the tame, ridiculously
modern dialogue ascribed to Potiphar’s wife,
whose Ternpe-refuge sort of repentance in the last
act was altogether disproportionate to the times —
taking a line, that is, from the unconsidered
goings-on of highly-respected representative
prophets. Also, her speech on woman’s in-
humanity to the woman who trips was as archaeo-
logically incorrect as a spring costume on the
Sphinx. There isn’t half an inch of “fat” for
Mrs. Potiphar (or anybody else, for that matter)
la the whole play—not one line a hair’s-breadth
above w.p.b. commonplaces. The play succeeds
by reas m of good acting, subtle costuming, fault-
less staging and marvellous scenery. It’s a Lord
Mayor’s show for glory, and a picture-gallery of
Eastern manners.
The toilet of George Rignold as Joseph, the
model co-respondent, passed through many vicis-
situdes, but ended smartly in white embossed vel-
vet with jewels. Indeed, magnificence reigned, and
the pomps of Pharaoh’s court can’t be depicted
without colors. The costumes of the Osiris ballet-
girls argiud that they were all little Mrs. Poti-
phars at heart; their primitive dressing—a cloud
of star-spangled black gauza over buff apparently,
suggested girl en aspic. By the way, the pictorial
success of “ Joseph ” owes a great deal to the
quantity of realistic nose carried as an everyday
thing by Her Majesty’s stock co. It is a great
advantage—if you want to stage scriptural stuff—
to have your supecs. recruited from the tribes of
Judah, I never saw anything so absolutely real-
istic as Joseph’s brethren seen in profile.
The musical event of last week—in fact, the
musical event of the year—was the Kruse concert,
at Sydney Centenary Hall, under the tegig of the
Much-Travelled Smythe, and in the presence of a
full-sized audience. It was a treat to see the
people’s faces coming out; they all seemed to be
(metaphorically) licking their lips, like so many
cream-stealing cats. The show was good all
round. Audiences who pay ss. a seat resent
having to “ make allowances” for the performers
—but, at the Kruse affair, the boot was on the
other foot, its artistes did the overlooking of the
want of genius on the audience’s part. For
instance, at the conclusion of the andante
movement of a seraphically-played Mendelssohn
trio, when Kruse was drawing a soft sostenuto to
its sweet, trembling conclusion, premature ap-
plause fell and mangled the whispering sound,
and the movement finished like a fox-hunt. Then,
in the final Vieuxtemps concerto, there were Goths
rushing out between the movements, under the
very nose of the artist. It strikes me that there
are politer ways of catching your tram—sitting
near the door, for one, or leaving before the final
item. By the way, the Kruse co. also suffered
above the ordinary from an ant-like procession
behind of people of no importance, loaded to the
front teeth, one could see, with soul-sickening
compliments. The artists’“crown of sorrow” is
the mob the interval brings. Another dreadful
thing was the handing up of a full-grown, able-
bodied laurel wreath to Kruse. The last lob of
laurels I saw went up to Elton and Kyley, at the
Munkhouse matinee. One of them hung his honors
on his ear, and the other his on his tall hat.
Kruse is indeed an artist. His music percolates
—you take it home with you. He is not only a
musician, he is an explorer who goes about dis-
covering human souls. You don’t notice details.
Drowning people don’t criticise the color of the
water, and Kruse drowns you in real melody.
He is a most'self effacing genius, too, although he
is the chosen of Joachim, the husband of what
Johnny Sheridan would call a “counter,’’ and
the owner of a genuine Strad. Any of these
would be enough for most people to strike an atti-
tude about, but, with all three, Kruse remains the
picture of male modesty in evening-dress. Yet,
when you come to think, it really isn’t such a sur-
prising thing that there should be no flies on
Kruse. Madame VViedermann, wife of the Aus-
trian Consul at Melbourne, and ex-pnma-donna
of the Imperial Opera, Vienna, was “honorary
vocalist.” Her style was altogether admirable,
boldly operatic in very classical solos by Wagner
and Brahms; and her toilet of cream brocade, with
black lace fichu, daffodils and diamonds, was in
good taste. Signor de Beaupuis (piano) and Herr
Hattenliach (’cello) also appeared_ to be artists of
high degree. But the moon turns to cheese when
the sun’s up. It was emphatically a Kruse con-
cert. .. .
By the way, if anybody thinks there is n°
diversity in the way a man can “do’’ his hair,
they ought to compare the coiffures of the Kruse
concert co. The star himself was clipped at the
rear, with the vegetationwaving at curling length
on top. Signor de Beaupuis cultivated a long
black wisp, which hung over his.forehead like the
curl of the naughty little girl—or a horse’s fore-
lock ; Herr Hattenbach wore a sawdust-colored
coryphee crop ; and Mr. Sykes (who accompanied)
was neatly barbered. It lias never before been so
strongly borne in upon me how easy-going Euterpe
is where the hair-dressing of her votaries is con-
cerned.
At Sydney Opera House, the other afternoon,
Dudley Wyatt, the calculating boy, inaugurated
the infant-phenomenon season, and gave a medical
and press view of himself, in a red plush suit, to a
stallsful of 'more or less professional persons.
Nearly all small boys are calculating, in a general '
sense, but Dudley is a daisy, who mentally does i
arithmetical puzzles, repeats myriads of tiresome
figures, solves problems,-and works sums with the
ease of a small boy devouring a bun. The only
drawback to Dudley is that nothing short of a.
rival prodigy could possibly say, at the moment,
whether his snap-shot snmming-np was correct or
not, for lie rattles off totals that would take
mathematicians whole hours toarrive at with the
aid of black coffee and wet towels. However, the
figures are all there to be copied down and proved,
but I am quite prepared—judging by the football
shape of Ins head—to take Dudley’s word for it.
By the way, if the calculating hoy’s bear-leader
made an effort to speak better English it would
make the show still more convincing. ’Twas
amusing, too, when said bear-leader conjured the
crowd not to give Dudley any logarithms off-
hand, whereupon everybody looked as if that was
just what they would have done in another
moment.
Talking about prodigies, it is cabled that Miss
Maude M’Carthy, the talented little violinist,
daughter of Dr. Charles W. M’Carthy, of Sydney,
has played before Queen Victoria and smaller
royalties at Osborne. Miss M’Carthy is going to
be a Johann Kruse in petticoats, and is another
artistic feather in Australians cap. London Times
recognises the leaven of a very great genius in the
child, who is even now completely installed in the
most exclusive artistic circles at’Ome. Austra-
lians will watch her career with interest.
The latest vice-regal news (there’s been a paucity
lately relieved by the publication of two rather
heavy-looking photos, purporting to be the Misses
Brand) is of a distinctly encouraging nature. It
seems that the promised Governor Hampden half
thought, ’pou me word, doncherknow, he’d trot
across to Australia!! by the same tub as his Excel-
lency and Lady Victoria Buxton and suite, but
on enquiring as to Sir Tough Eowell’s tastes he
decided that the following week’s steamer would
suit him better. It is reassuring to know that
the imminent N.S. \V. Gov. doesn’t run to tea-
and-toast and mothers’ meetings in his moments
of recreation, but it’s a pity, all the same, that he
didn’t endure a voyage with the saintly brewer,
since Tough Eowl’s tub lands him, bar accidents,
in neat time for Melbourne Cup, on Ist Nov.,
while Hampden, who is a sport, will be days after
the fair. Always back a saint for a front place
when the curtain goes up, even if he’s only come
to draw a moral.
Lady Hampden is said to be a replica of Lady
Jersey, but this doesn’t apply to her photos.,
though these are said to do but indifferent justice
to that “decisive dame’s speaking physiognomy.”
Lady H.’a Force of Character seems to me to be
the only real rock ahead in our roseate vice-regal
future. In an enumeration of the necessary attri-
butes of a colonial Governor, an “ex-privatesecre-
tary ” gives bis views on the subject in an English
journal, and firstly enumerates: “If possible, he
should be a peer, with a pleasant wife.” Now,
the question is : Does a lady with the soul of a
horse-marine and the geographical profile of the
Cavendishes seem likely to come under the head-
ing of a pleasant person ?
Popularity is an unaccountable tiling. To
Australians who remember Sir Hercules Robinson
as a past idol, it is strange to see bow a lot of the
Cape Town folks boil about his re-appointment as
Governor. “There is only one person less
acceptable than Sir Hercules, and that is Lady
Rvibinson. Government House receptions are
still remembered.” After all, in vice-regal popu-
larity, plenty of tea-parties is the secret of success.
Which reminds me that a certain Acting-
Governor’s unpopularity dated from the time it
leaked out that for a ball-supper for nearly a thou-
sand guests he paid the Scottish sum of a little
over a century—or at the rate of two shillings per
caput! Nothing excites .latent disloyalty like
sardine sandwiches,
“The Idlers” Amateur Dramatic Club has
fixed next Thursday (12th) as the date of its
performance of “Going It,” a smart farcical
comedy. The Standard Theatre is to he the place
of action, and a large Johnny Hed attendance is
confidently anticipated, with acting vice-royalty in
the front row. “The Idlers" are the old, suc-
cessful “ Magpies ” with another name on their
note-paper.
The very latest society wrinkle observable in
Melbourne for levying polite blackmail loaves the
good old wedding-present highway robbery a bad
second. The new notion is to give an “at home”
when an interesting family event is pending, so
that friends may gather round to gush over the
tucks on the christening robe, or the superior
finish of the pincushion, and generally admire the
gifts sent in for the approaching little stranger.
Under these circumstances the R.S.V.P. on the
invitation card might be cynically translated
“ Real Snap ; Visitor Pays," for the guests feel it
incumbent on them, of course, to add their little
mite in the form of a mug ora pair of bootees to
the mound on exhibition, and so the merry little
show works out its own div.
The ways of committees are generally very dark,
and the ways of the committee who over-manage
Sydney Ladies’ Club appear to be a shade darker
than most, judging by the feathers that are flying
at the corner of King and George streets, where
the club premises are. The altercation over the
president foisted on to the club without the help
of the ballot-box still continues with much enthu-
siasm on the part of the ordinary members, who
maintain that ten committees cannot make a
president without the formality of an election,
and who promise the unwelcome interloper a warm
time on the first official occasion. It is probable
that the first time she presides at a meeting her
own membership will be called in question, and
then, if women are still women on the good old
plan, the scene should be a study in hysterics.
However, nobody dreams of blaming the members
for the rumpus—the fault lies with the autocratic
committee, who want everything their own way.
There is not the least hope of the “president”
peacefully resigning any more than there is of a
certain Judge peacefully resigning. Masculine
arbitration would be the most sensible way to end
the business.
A batch of recent music includes “The Yaralla
Gavotte,” dedicated to Australia’s richest and
most.philanthropic heiress, Miss Eadith Walker,
and composed by Mrs. Emilie Ludlow. Coming
amongst the first droppings of what promises to
be a shower of gavottes raking the place of the
recent storm of waltzes, the Yaralla is worthily
in the van. It is a tuneful, rhythmic and dainty
composition, well-marked and harmonious, pos-
sessing the old-world air from start to finish.
Another pretty piece of work is “ Adieu,” a song,
words by Alex. Montgomery, and music by the
redoubtable Miss Maud Fitz-Stubbs, whose
speaking likeness lends additional joy to an
already artistic title-page. The sorrowful words
go hand-in-hand with the subdued music, and
though the song lias not the showiness and
screechiness of “A Broken Promise,” it will
still appeal to people who don’t care about their
music reaching for eight miles in every direction.
From South Australia comes a copy of “Thula
Waltz,” by J. Ingham Cox, in a green cover (I
mean the waltz), and dedicated to the ladies of
S.A., to whom I offer my deepest sympathy ;
and Miss Lena Brasch (Sydney) sends a copy of
her “Olga Waltz,” now scudding before the breeze
of a fourth edition.
Messrs. J. W. Johnston and Co., machine im-
porters, Sydney, are showing a gorgeous article in
“ The New Home ” sewing-machine, which works
as softly as a muffled clock, and is constructed in
very handsome and novel patterns, including one
with a flat table-top on which you could write
letters or dispense afternoon tea after the needle-
work was done. Under circumstances of this kind
a sewing-machine becomes a parlor ornament, a
great deal more lovely than the cracked piano in-
variably found there. What a pity, too, that
female cyclists don’t get some return for their
violent exertion by strengthening their calves on
sewing-machine pedals instead.
“Gentleman Joe’’ went well en matindc at
Sydney Lyceum—it is a good morning show
from all points, because the locally-made and
triumphant gowns have set all the women talking,
besides putting them on warm terms with local
frockists. Now that it has been proved, on a bril-
liantly-costumed stage, that Sydney can “make”
equal to London and Paris, the woman who con-
siders it high tone to say (at least) that she
“imports all her best gowns, of course,” will
rapidly become a curiosity. Grace Palotta and
her black-and-white blend are a combination
which will take a lot of beating by stage
elegantes, and I absolutely predict a black-and-
white Melbourne Cup lawn on the strength of it.
By the way, I hear that no local frock-builder is
responsible for Maud Hobson’s startling water-
melon gowning in Act 1.
A novel sort of “at home ” eventuated at the
very workmanlike rooms of Sydney Fencing Club,
the other Tuesday, when, at the invitation of the
President of the Cut and Thrustees, Dr. Reuter
Roth, a number of ladies assembled to see the
fun. The proceedings unwisely began with tea.
It is very undodgy to begin with tea at a hen-
party. You should hold out the promise of tea at
the finish as you hold out cold carrots before a
donkey—if you want to keep your audience. The
fencing exhibition made up into a picturesque
show: the plain walls covered with murderous
weapons—bayonets, swords, rapiers, foils, as the
bane, with padded gloves, tunics and masks as
the antidote; the lithe attitudes of the duellists;
the bare and dusty floor, the wooden benches
covered with brightly-attired femininity—all quite
magazine-pictureish.
Fencing is a healthy and graceful pastime, a
knowledge of which enables a girl to rely more
upon her parasol in an emergency than another
maiden does on her frequently-unavailable big
brother, and the only drawback to it is purely
aesthetic—the gear is so ugly. During the after-
noon one nice-looking and agile youth, who did
wonders with a bayonet and sword item, was
simply a sketch in a granny bonnet trimmed with
russet ribbons and white frilling, with a black net
veil over the face—at least, that is what it looked
like, though the awful structure was really a most
warlike bit of millinery in leather, steel and wire.
He also had a leather cuirass padded to the verge
of excessive embonpoint, and when this shifted in
the stress of combat the effect was most comical.
Still, the uglier the gear the more bloodthirsty the
sword-play. In fencing circles the more you re-
semble a pearl-diver the greater your powers.
As times go, every girl who dreams of engaging
herself to a nice boy ought certainly to know how
to defend herself. A gift of getting in neatly
with her left would be worth a lot to a
modern engaged girl when Gussie became
dominated by the idea that they must die
together. By the way, a recent Sydney society
wedding ran to a very up-to-date honeymoon, the
happy man and maid “departing on a shooting
expedition”—a gun being one of the bride-gifts.
Considering how Cupid has lately been carrying
on, this way of starting married life seems ex-
tremely apropos.
My Melb. correspondent writes o—
“ There is a really Magbificetit Person in Melb.
at present, and as ho only appears to know those
who sit amonij the most exclusively enthroned
gods on the highest-priced seats, outsiders want
to know who he is. The fashion of his garments
is so smart as to be weird. His pants are of the
pegtop order, and have huge pleats inserted at
each hip, just beside the side-pockets. His over-
coat is showy and brown, and is lined with
rustling satin, and adorned with much brown
velvet and huge smoked-pearl buttons. In any
collection of instruments of torture, his boots and
collars would hold honorable positions. Now,
who is he ?
“An amusing scene took place between I’Abb4
Titheradge and la Comtesse Olliffe, the other
evening, at Melb. Bijou. When la Comtesse is
going through spasms of remorse, L’abb6 puts a
fatherly, comforting hand on her shoulder. Owing
to Mi ss Olliffe’s huge sleeves, G.T. only sncceede 1
in clutching a mass of buckram and silk. Miss
O. wriggled slightly, and managed to shake the
hand off. At last, with a good deal of dexterity,
G.T. managed to insinuate his hand on to the inch
of silk between the monstrous sleeves and the
lady’s bare neck. Then the Comtesse and the Abb£
looked at each other and laughed, and the audi-
ence joined in.
“The exodus of Melb. society-girls to India
still continues. Fciur really pretty creatures
leave this week to spend the corning season in
different parts of the Empire. A gallant military
horse-buyer, who was lately in Melb., for three
weeks buying remounts, was snapped up by a
demure-looking little girl. These twain marry
early next year, and will live in some remote
village near Mandalay, which will probably be
almost as lonesome as Smellbourne is at present.
“ Miss Sibyl Bevan, youngest of Dr. Sevan’s
three daughters, is studying medicine, with a
view to going to China as a medical missionary.
The eldest daughter; Muriel, is a talented
musician, and is studying under Marshall Hall.
“The shabbiest-looking member of his Cabinet,
as usual, Premier Turner went to the Agricul-
tural Show luncheon in the same old brown suit
and bowler-hat in which he works in his ooice.
Sir Beef Patterson was there in frock-coat, shiny
hat and gaiters, and all the other Sir Nobody
Thingumys were attired in their Sunday-clothes.
But nothing spoils Premier George. He wasn’t
built for a show object, and he left his office to go
and speak at the luncheon ; and, having said his
necessary say, he went straight back again to his
work.
“ The stand at the Agricultural Show on
Friday, during the jumping-contest, had quite a
Cup-Uay appearance; Spring, hats bloomed all
around, like splashes of paint on a huge palette.
‘That get-up,’ said a girl just from- the Con-
tinent, ‘really brings a whiff of the Champs
Elysees.’ She referred to Florence Young, who
really did look Frenchy in a blouse of match-box
silk, worn (she glories in her IGin. shaiie) without
a waistband, tlie'divorce of bodice and skirt being
prevented by a vast gold safety-pin, her hat a
wilderness of green, and pink, and purple. Mrs.
Bland Holt, in', Chow-green silk, with bodice of
bronze-ami green shot-brocade, had on the very
first bonnet she ever wore ; it was of bronze bead-
work and plumes, and in it she looked charming.
The ladies not on the stand mostly favored cos-
tumes of gay sateen, of weird cut —even a ‘ bustle ’
was discerned here and there—boots of cruel-
looking, unyielding leather, and altitudinous hats
of plush and plumes; and all, without exception,
clutched handbags.
“The most wonderful sight in the Agricultural
Society’s show was hot fn the bull-pens, nor in the
horse-arena, nor amongst the machinery, but on
the head of Lady Holled-Smith. It was one of
the new fashionable hats. If all the contents,of a
painter’s box had been squeezed on to it, it cduld
not have contained more colors. Reds laughed at
greens, blues howled across the crown at yellows,
and pinks chased browns, and blacks, and purples’
round the brim. It was a horticultural nightmare
of a hat; and all the women said it was “ lovely.”
“ There is this to be said to the credit of acting-.
Gov. Madden : he and his family are well worth
looking at. They look well at the top of a table.
At the Agricultural Show luncheon, the Madden
girls were quite the prettiest in the room. 'Mrs.
Governor was as good-looking as any woman
of her age present. The Madden ladies on these
occasions do not pursue the Mrs. Hopetoun tradi-
tion of outvieing every other woman in the matter
pf costume. They dress with plain, wholesome,
undowdy, becoming simplicity.
“It is the regulation thing that the
opening speech at, the above show should cause
‘roars of laughter.’ The burden of a historical
speech by Gov. Nonnanby was that Victoria was
the best place in,the world to breed pigs in.
People have not yet ceased to giggle at acting?
Gov. Madden’s lovely unintentional double?
entente, at the recent show-opening.
“The acting-Governor’s daughters have pretty
hands and arms—hence their desire to divest
themselves of gloves, whenever possible. At the
theatre, the other evening, tin ir manual curves
and dimples, accentuated by rings and bangles,
were edifying the proletariat before the attendant
aides had decided on the respective merits of the
■vacant seats in the vice-regal box.

That harmlessly nebulous personage, Coun-

The chairman then regretfully admitted that the

abstainers. In this, conventional teetotalism is
very like conventional religion : it is run largely
by people who consider it a deuced fine thing for

The Maoris in and about
M.L. Parliament relate that
when Louis Becke and his friend,
J. D. Fitzgerald, of Sydney,
visited the native korero in the
King country, they were called
upon for a speech. J.D.F., as a
politician, got along famously,
and quite as fast as Martin (a
young Maori who acted as in-
terpreter) could translate. But
Becke was not such a success.
He floundered through a sea of
painfully-embarrassed common-
places, and looked as if he
wished the ordeal finished. A
bevy of barefooted Maori
maidens ogled him throughout
the speech, but surely this could
never have discomposed the
author of “ By Reef and Palm !”
Eventually he blurted out:
“ This is the fu-fu-flrst time I’ve
spoken in pup-pup-public, and
I’ll tut-tut-take hlanty fine care
it’ll be the last!” Which mag-
nificent peroration the interpre-
ter repeated faithfully, hairing
the blanks, which, thanks to the
virility of the English language,
the Maoris understood and ap-
preciated without the interpre
ter’s artful aid.

a pension, Australia should pay it to her. It is
enough for Imperialism to “ recognise ” the talent
that is in a MTntyre, a Benjamin Benjamin, or a
Snowden.
S.M. Herald thinks the intellectual pas-
sion which impels Parkes at 80 to produce poems
is “remarkable and admirable.” No more
“admirable” than the “ passion ” which impels
an elderly whale to secrete ambergris. Both
poems and ambergris are products of disease—but
the whale’s product is worth £lO 10s. per oz.

No one in Australia writes less legibly
than Howard Willoughby, of the Argus. He
sent in “copy,” the other day, on the reverse
side of which were some of his shorthand
notes. Presently the foreman was asked by a
comp. : “Which side of tins shall I set, sir? I
can read one side just as easily as the other.”
Fisher, the Nunawading (Yic.) Messiah,
is reported to be still extant. The old gentle-
man’s church amuses itself, on moonlight eves,
with a game called “ Chase the Devil Round the
Stump,’’ when the ladies and gentlemen thread the
mazes of the stringybarks, red-gums, blue-gums,
and apple-trees of the vicinage, with much gusto.
Yic. Labor-leader Trenwith is to be the
recipient of a subscription at the hands of brother
M’s.P. of all colors to help him on his way ’Ome
to consult leading London oculists. A pity the
democrats of the province have not taken action
to render the Parliamentary collection unneces-
sary. Trenwith will be rather delicately situated
when politics compel him to fall foul of generous
subscribers amongst the enemy.
Julian Salomons, the smartest of N.S.W.

tion of a co-religionist, who helped him to the Eng-
lish Bar. His income is now alleged to be from
.£7009 to £lO,OOO a year, which he spends in globe-
trotting, purchasing pictures and buying books.
He has one of the finest private collections of
books in Australia; and in pictures, the best col-
lection of rubbish.
A Yic. Town Hall, which for magnificence
and site would be a credit to any Australian
metropolis, was built in sections, as funds per-
mitted, and each addition has a most glaring
foundation-stone, with the names of the various
Mayors of the day deeply cut in gilt letters.
There were 18 names altogether, and of these one
man is now an Australian Cabinet Minister, three
have skipped hurriedly to other climes, four are
in gaol, one is a J.P., three are insolvents not yet
certificated, two are dead, and four others are
Heaven knows where.
Q. Supreme Court Judge Harding, who
died on the last day of Aug., after 16 years’
judicial service, was not quite 57 years of age—
very young for a Judge to die. He (though nick-
named “Bruin,” in recognition of his wondrous
“ liver ’’) wasn't a bad-natured man, with more law
than physique, thoroughly honest, and affable
enough if yon kow-towed with a proper sense of
his dignity. Harding acted temporarily as Chief
Justice during Lilley’s absence, at the end of ’B3 ;
and when, on Lilley’s retirement, Griffith jockeyed
himself into the position—to which Harding by
standing and competence had far better claim —he
keenly resented the slight and the trickery. The
old man worked till the last—proceeding with a
Case within two days of his death, though in great
pain, in order that the parties might not suffer
inconvenience by postponement.

REMARKABLE ACCIDENT }■
AT SEA,
A VESSEL STRUCK BY A WHALE.
A strange tale of the sea was told yester-
:'y t 0 the visitors who boarded the bar-
luontine Handa Isle upon her arrival from
vlercury Bay, timber-laden. Captain A.
lobmson states that early in theaf ternbon
vatch on August 24, when the vessel was
n lat. 36deg. ISmin. south, and long.
■.ssdeg. 31min. east, two whales were sight-
ed making a course to cross, her bows,
rhey were each about 60ft. long, and were
ravelling at a high rate of speed, their
orogress being closely watched by those pa
board. When quite close they suddenly
altered their course, and came end on do
the ship. Both seemed likely to strike
abq.iit amidships, but one avoided the colli-
sion-, fty diving.‘the other hitting just abaft
the mainmast, and a couple of feet beiptf
the waterline.

with regard to the indiscriminate betting-

POLITICAL
POINTS
If N.S.W. Civil Service is to be retrenched
throughout with the same sort of nepolistio dis-
crimination as has been shown in the Works
Department, then may the Lord have mercy on
the N.S.W. Civil Service !
The S.M. Herald’s appeal to Lyne not to
continue “ flogging the dead horse of Protection ”
is probably based on the fact that Reid is just now
busy flogging that same animal, and there isn’t
room for two men to get at him simultaneously.
Federation must be far-off when Treas.
Fysh(Tas.) objects to “foreigners” (Vic. fisher-
men) casting their nets or lines into the ocean
within three miles of his island. Why doesn’t
Fysh prohibit Victorians breathing Tasmanian
air ?
Under the new S.A. Public Salaries Re-
duction Bill Ministers themselves will sacrifice
£l7O each and M.sP. £7 10s. each yearly. The
Agent-General will have to give up £307 10s. out
of his £l5OO a year, while the Governor drops
from £5OOO to £4OOO.
Charles Gavan Duffy, one of Victoria’s
oldest pensioners, i 5.79; Andrew Clarke is 71,
and Childers is 68. They draw among them
£2500 a year, and Premier-Treasurer Turner, who
wants that £2500 to help put his deficiency, feels
towards them much as Cain did towards Abel.
The calm that should pervade every right-
minded Governmentdepartment is never disturbed
now as in the days of old “ White-horse” Steven-
son, ex-M.P., the ten-years’ model of N.S.W,
road-and-bridee members, for the old man was a
more regular attendant at the offices than the
Ministers. He used to boast that he had never
made use of a committee or scrutineer nor shouted
for an elector.
The Argus says that
nationalists in Australia are
far less in evidence than the
anti - vaccinationists. But
the Aegus, with all its eyes,
has no more discernment than
a seed-potato.
It is just three years since
Bryan O’Loghlen and hia
little following of office-
seekers abandoned the Shiels
Government and thus caused
its downfall and the rise of
J. B. Patterson. And now,
with the solitary exception of
M'Coll, not one of that party
of deserters remains in the
House. Shiels didn’t amount
to much at the best, but the
country never forgave, the men
who sacrificed him to elevate
groveller Patterson.
Robert Stout opposes
the idea of levying local rates,
in Maoriland, on unimproved
land-values, on the assump-
tion that it will induce city
landlords to crowd as many
buildings as possible on their
ground and so aggravate the
slum evil. Stout’s theory
figures out somewhat as fol-
lows : If a man has £4BO worth
of laud the land-tax. at Id. in
the £, will be £2 per annum,
and if there is one house on
the property bringing in a
rental ol .£5O a year the tax
will be 4 per cent. If the
owner crowds four houses on
the same area, he may get
£l5O a year and reduce the
tax to less than 1£ per cent.
Which might pan out all right
if every landlord was a hair-
less logician, with a chess-
board mind, who would pursue
the decimal of a halfpenny to
the bitter end—but then he
isn’t.
Treas. Ward, of Maori-
land, made about the worst
mistake a politician could
make in his budget speech.
He had grown wildly effusive
about the Canadian recipro-
city treaty, and circulated a
copy of the Canadian tariff
ihowing the duties which he
had arranged to baveabolished
in favour of Maoriland ex-
porters. Then Stout got up
and grimly pointed out that
Ward was fooling round with
an old abandoned tariff of
years ago, and the most im-
portant duties which he
thought be had got abolished
Ss a special favor to Maoriland
had been altogether done away
with some time in 'l)4. The
Ministry felt so small that it
had thoughts of hiding itself
under a form, until fighting
Dick Seddon arose and stated
in general terms that Stout
was a serpent and a deceiver,
or words to that effect.
Eight N.S.W. Leg. Councillors voted
against Pigott’s motion, to the effect that a state-
ment made by Premier Reid that the Council “ * is
a rotten and corrupt House ’ was scandalous and
false.” Therefore, eight N.S.W. Councillors have
voted that the House, of which they are members,
is “rotten and corrupt.”
A bill now before S.A. Parliament makes
it penal for any brewer or spirit dealer who has a
mortgage over a publican to compel the latter to
buy liquor from him exclusively. When the
brewer can no longer sell his bad liquor to the
mortgaged publican at an exorbitant price, there
won’t be much joy left in the business.
“ The hospital-nurse dispute here,” writes
an Adelaide correspondent to The Bulletin, “ is
a bigger thing than you seem to think, and it is
not at all improbable that it will cause the over-
throw of the Kingston Govt., as the medical
trades-union and ‘Society’ (represented by the
unjustly-promoted nurses) are arrayed against
them.”
The Foreign-trade S.M. Herald admits
mournfully that “ the question raised in the
(British) House of Commons relative to the in-
spection of the cattle and sheep killed in Aus-
tralia for export as frozen-meat ” is “dictated by
a desire to establish protection to British agri-
culture.” Britain is now the only great civilised
nation that even pretends to be Free trade in
policy.
Says Sydney Telegraph ; “The proposal
to amend the tariff and impose Land and Income-
taxes was the thing upon which the verdict (at
last N.S.W. election) was specially asked for. . . .
The country’s answer was given at the polls with
equal plainness.” Yet Premier Reid and the
Telegraph both alleged at the time that they
went to the country on the one definite issue of
Upper House reform. What was the issue, and
what did the country really vote for, or did it
really give a distinct vote for any tiling?
Schey, M.P.’s, question to Premier Reid
as to whether he would afford an opportunity for
Price, M.P., to bring on his motion dealing with
Justice Windeyer was pertinent. Can justice be
properly administered, or full satisfaction be felt
by the community and those who come under the
operation of the courts, while such a serious
motion hangs over the head of a Supreme Court
Judge ? No other Premier would tolerate it —nor
would many Judges sit under the circumstances,
practically with a noose round their necks, to wait
for the dull sickening thud of Parliamentary con-
demnation, or for the coining of a reprieve.

In connection with the Melb. honorary-

advocated the appointment of those J’s.P. who

Joseph Cook wouldn’t have anybody in
politics who hasn’t “ succeeded in life”— i.c., come
out on top in the universal dollar-worry. But
special capacity for dealing witli large questions
and broad general principles is often found asso-
ciated with a total lack of that aptitude for detail
which makes nine-tenths of the art of fortune-
building. And Cook, himself, is good proof of
the converse —that a pronounced cash-cultivating
talent may co-exist witli a short-range intellect
and a wooden-legged soul.

THE RAILWAY-TICKET PROBLEM: ITS SOLUTION.
LADY TRAVELLR: “ Give me a first-class return to Sydney ,
please .”
CLERK: “ Yes, madam! But before handing you this ticket,
kindly take this Bible in your hand and swear that you
do solemnly and sincerely declare you will not sell to
any person or persons this return-ticket. ”
The story of the Totalisator Bill in Yic.
Assembly was that of the Quieting of Titles Bill
repeated.
If it is an undisputed “constitutional ”
axiom that N.S.W. Leg. Council cannot in any
way interfere with the details of “ loan ” expendi-
ture —as has been authoritatively asserted both
by the Assembly and its Speaker—how is it that
N.S.W. Public Works Committee has always con-
sisted of members of both Houses? What do
Legislative Councillors want in that gallery at all,
if they may not modify “ loan ” expenditure?
Again : Was there ever since the world
began so cold-blooded a set of people as the suc-
cessive N.S.W. Ministers of Justice? One in-
vents or approves of a new flap for the hangman’s
cap; his successor approves of a “humane gaol
gag.” Who can wonder, in view of these men’s
toleration of judicial scandals which fairly shriek
to God for vengeance, that the populace affects to
regard routine incidents of the cap and gag order
as typical of the administrators in question ?

Rev. Haweis, on Aus-
tralian loyalty: “I have
seen more statues of Queen
Victoria in a week in Aus-
tralia than I have seen in 20
years in London.” Rev.
Haweis might also see mors
Chinese joss-houses, and
more hideous heathen gods,
and more quaint Polynesian
frescoes of island deities, in
one week in Queensland than
he would in a lifetime in
London, and might also
draw therefrom a number of
equally startling and ridicul-
ous deductions,
Angus Cameron, M.P.
(N.S.W.), addressed a letter
to Speaker Abbott com-
plaining that he was not
chosen as one of the deputy-
speakers appointed to re-
lieve Chairman M‘Court.
Of course the reason is ob-
vious : Mr. Cameron has
declared against and was
elected as an opponent of
payment of members, and
therefore should not be ap-
pointed to any paid position
where he would have to
refuse the salary. Hence it
should be useless for the
Government to nominate
him to the Public Works
Committee, where fees would
be forced on him, to his dis-
gust. The Bulletin trusts
that members will not insult
this patriot by forcing him
into any position where he
will be offered money.
Frank Cotton, M.P.
(N.S.W.), who was always
of the inner brotherhood of
automatic Land-taxers, now
“ barracks ” for exemptions.
He was, if The Bulletin
mistakes not, the father
of the famous 13th plank of the original Labor
platform, which declared for the tax absolutely
without exemptions.
Could the democrats who cheered N S. W.
Attorney-General “Jack” Want during the late
election have seen him at the opening of Parlia-
ment “with them all on,” what would they have
thought of the declaration of his conversion to
popular views since joining the Reid Cabinet?
Had he gone into King Division in his “ Court ”
costume—knee breeches, cocked hat, and lace
ruffles —it would have lost his colleague the elec-
tion.
Strange that the Henry Georgean land
taxers like Cotton, Cook, Hollis & Co., who were
wont to talk a species of patois composed of
Georgean phrases, carry no weight in the N.S.W.
Assembly land-tax debates now in progress. On
theotherhand, men with practical knowledge of the
land question, such as Ashton, Millen and Crick,
are listened to in a House whose mental attitude
generally is “lead, kindly light, amid encircling
gloom. ”
The Westralian Government has decided
to largely reduce taxation on the ground that it is
getting more revenue than it requires. The idea
of using the surplus revenue, while the boom is on
and there is a surplus, for railway construction, is
too preposterous to be entertained by the average
Australian politician, so the borrowing process
goes on joyfully. By-and-bye, when the boom is
dead, and the bottom falls out of the revenue, and
the railway returns have dropped heavily, and the
public lands won’t sell, and Westralia is struggling
hard to pay interest on her borrowings, her people
will want to hunt up these gay and hopeful legis-
lators of to-day and hang them on a jarrah tree.
If Lyne will only leave off syndicates, and
have no dealings with anti-ant compounds, and
give up all ideas of selling the railways and tram-
ways to an English co., and officially abjure his
friend Waller, against whom there seems to be an
unaccountable prejudice, and swear off all sem-
blance of association with one or two M.sL.A.
whose names the public somehow regard with a
sinister eye, and will try to get a little more in
line with the democratic sentiment of theconntry,
he be a great success as leader of the
N.S.W. Protectionist party. He can’t possibly
have such bad luck as Dibbs—there isn’t enough
bad luck to go round. He is not commonly sup-
posed to have any emotions. He hasn’t Dibbs’s
craving to provoke a hopeless fight against heavy
odds when there is nothing to be gained save the
joy of fighting, so he will never tell the whole
globe to go to perdition, as his late chief was quite
capable of doing. And he has brains enough to
do great and good things—if he likes. But the
country has never quite made up its mind whether
he is likely to like, or not.

Mark Hamhourg, the lightning and thunder pianist,
was riding in an Adelaide Mar near when some laities
started to discuss his gymnastics of tire previous night.
He happened to lie sitting on their side of tire car, shut
off from view by an intervening fat man. The ladies
decided that Mark might have made quite as much noise
with far less exertion, and they were bringing in a verdict
of “rather ridiculous, I’m sure,” when the Russian artist
fleered round the stout person’s waistcoat and spoke : “ It
a all-ways de way wid some la dies dat de less dey knows
demoredey liaf to chatter.” The word “ridiculous"
had pierced little Mark’s armour of reserve.
Rose Alhu, the well-known singer, who a few years since
toured Australasia, was married lately in London to a
wealthy merchant. Her sister, Lire charming Julie, who
some time ago married well in Honolulu, was present at
the wedding, which appears to have been a most glitter-
ing function.
Tommy Hudson, of nig.-minstrel fame, lias just had the
pleasure of reading a flattering obituary notice of himself,
Euhlished in Calcutta Sunday Times. It was one and a-
alf cols. long. The artful Times man had probably
heard Tommy was again coming to Calcutta.
Pianist de Beaupiis, who left Adelaide to play with

Saintly Bendigo mining magnate, on being shown Falk’s
exquisite portrait of Decima Moore, printed in a recent

In Oscar Wilde’s “Importance of Being Earnest’’one
of the characters talks about emigrating, and he is
advised that he will have to choose between “ this world,
the next world, and Australia.” “The accounts I have
received of the next world and Australia,” lie replies,
“ are not very encouraging.”
An aggressively foolish comment on Oscar Wilde’s
“The importance of Being Earnest” appeared in a
M ■lb. paper. The critic found that Oscar had got one
of Ilia “smart sayings ” from France, “ where the leaders
of loquacity are held to be dentists and hairdressers.”
Evidently lie heard somebody laugh when Cecil Ward
said to Boucicault, “ You talk like a dentist,” which, by
the way, is not a peculiarly smart saying as it stands.
The stnartness lay in its application to a previous remark
by Boucicault, who was encouraging his friend to make
full confession of a certain little secret that troubled him.
“ Come, sit down and hace it out,” said Boucicault.
“You talk like a dentist,” said Ward. A plain, old-
fashioned joke, with never a suspicion of French meaning
in it. The newspaper genius missed the joke.
Quite a number of high-toned Melbourne youths, when
“on their uppers,” take a turn in a juvenile minstrel

Vic. Parliament wrestles with a Theatres Act Amend-
ment Bill, and is.pra.v erfully petitioned by 83 members of
the profession that the law may be so framed as to secure
“ the absolute prohibition in any form whatever of con-
certs or other public entertainments on the Sabbath day,
wheth u r in licensed theatres or other places, or whether
right of admission is by payment, ticket, or collection.”
This is an intolerant attitude to assume towards the
churches. By the way, “ respectable managers ” contend
that their Monday night audiences are spoilt by the
Sunday shows at the ’alls. The people running the
S ihbath evening entertainments will not feel much hurt
if the bill is carried, judging by the fact that every Sun-
day night, at each, after the collection, a blighted
individual in an abundant dress-suit advances to the foot-
lights with a pathetic complaint t hat these entertain-
ments will have to be discontinued if, on the following
Sunday evening, so many mangled 3d. pieces and trouser-
buttons flow into the plates. Here, at least, is a bond of
sympathy between church and stage.
A subscription-list has been opened for the family of
Bland Holt’s late m -chanist, who died very poor.
M ihoramnd, the talking horse now coming to Australia
with Fitzgerald Bios.’ new co., is reported to be a native
of B ithurst, where ins sire, Forest King, belongs to Mr.
J. J. Sullivan, of Alloway B -nk. His remarkable attain-
m mts are a standing illustration of the exhilarating effect
of travel upon Australian men and horses. Mahommed
will share with Kruse, Melba, and Haddon Chambers,
to say nothing of Henniker Heaton and the fighting
kangaroo, the fame of having shown what Australians
can do when they get a bigger opportunity than they get
h>Te, where a man’s talents are always discounted by the
mim rous person who says What, him clever 1 Why,

sing ! Why, I used to go to school with her sister, Wary.
S le can’t sing !”
“Juliet Wray” has been nasalised (by the Melbourne-
galleryite) into “ Wry.” And when one watches some of
i lie lean twists of her body it seems apposite.
B.&: Juli i Flegeltauh “ Wray ’’ has come to stop. The
first' impression, when she “jumps’’onto the stage, is-
u ifiiv'orahle. “The Firm’s” new “lead” is thin and
a ignlar, not to be too explicit. One cannot help noticing
her good points—there are so many of them. And her
physiognomy is a national signboard. But when she
opens her mouth -and she is not a/raiil to open it—and
sings,The sharp face and little, lean figure are forgotten
for tlie rest of the evening. Her voice is as fresh as a
linnet’s. In acting, for “vim” she hasn’t her equal on
the boards. M r over, her smile is ss. worth of
satisfaction in itself. The stage maxillary-douhle-actiori
is a mech uiioal thing, as a rule. But the bony little
Jewess “smiles,” she doesn’t grin. Sle has the truly
“colonial ” self-possession (otherwise “cheek”), is nearly
as vivacious as Nellie Stewart, and more magnetic than the
latter ever was, a id for these and other reasons J.F.W.
ins come to stay. But stie is thin!
“Kosher”; Australians are at last repenting their
grievous errors of judgment in not early recognising the
genius of many native-born artists who, condemned in
the lind of their birth, have risen to eminence in
countries where the standard of excellence is, or should
lie, higher. In palliation of tills blunder they rolled up
gallantly to witness Miss Juliet Wray’s initial Melbourne
performance in a professional capacity, and verily her re-
ception must have been most reassuring to her. From
the very first mom nt of her appearance before the lights
she did not seem to suffer from any undue diffidence. Her
wig was fair and h»r toilette charming, hut her thin, not
to say emaciated, figure was the subject of much unfavor-
able comment, especially among the male section. How
is it that men so devotedly admire figures plump and
even buxom in Hie opposite sex? They can seldom
reflect that grace and ease of movement reach a
higher state of perfection in slim, lithe forms. Miss
Wray looked very bright and elegant in a dress slightly
above her ankles, but methinks that in tights she would
closely resemble a v iotim of the Indian famine.
Fil zroy : The Comic Opera Co. at Melii., Princess’s this
season is a sort of Pharaoh’s vision. It is a noticeably
well-fed crowd, but Florence Young, facially more chubby
Ilian at her last visit, stands out particularly as a re-
presentative of th • fat kiue. Almost everybody,
down to the cherubic Caron, suggests an advt. for the
“Full and Plenty Restaurant.” And into the midst of
this well-fed assemblage strays the lean kine—poor,
skinny, little Flegeltauh Wray! The contrast is ludi-
crous. A placard seems indispensable —“ Ido not dine at
Siam Iso’s.”
More Wray; “An observant person who didn’t know
w wild say that the Finn’s new donna had served her
a ipr nticeship upon the music-hall stage. Miss Juliet
Wray’s voice is very suggestive of the ’alls, hut her
maimer of ha idling l-gs, so to speak, would tend to
dispel tlie illusion. Juliet’s legs, as exhibited in a Maige-
Ross3.ltlike grab at tlie skirts in the last act of “Angot,”
give a critical Monday night audience a severe chill.
They lack cultivation, and may prove unequal to the
« were demands of W. and M.’s repertoire. The present
e irilie might have soma compunction in speaking thus
plainly' of a you ig lady's legs were it not that they are
inually admitted in a comic-opera prima-donna.”
Tue sight at Krusi’s M 4b. concert was a well known
N iw Woman in the three-shilling spats calmly reading one
of those pink publications which lately were de-
nounoed In the Assembly as immoral. She listened with
rapt attention to Johann, but in the intervals she read
her paper. Every time she I urned over, displaying the
illustrated pages of horrors and naughtiness, thrills of
excitement radiated all around her. When the music re-
commenced she kept her thumb on the gory atrocity she
was reading, and was again absorbed in the soulful
strains.
Pro.: “ Rignold, in his advt., refers to the prejudices
which, * perhaps mistakenly,’ certain persons have e. the
Stage. Why ‘perhaps?’ lias he half a notion Varley
and co. are right? Somehow it faintly recalls Barry
Sullivan’s speech to the objurgated supe, who knelt
before him. ‘ Sir, you must appeal to another, and per-
haps Higher Power.* ”
The last Scriptural production on the Melb. stage was
Lyster’s, of R issini’s "Moses in Egypt.” When the
speaking trumpet sounded from the top of the mountain,
a gallery god called out, “ Is that Lyster?”
Dear Bulletin, —Rev. Geo. Waiters, acting, no doubt,
in his clerical capacity, has re-ciiristened Mrs. Potiphar
by the name of Ayesha. Ayeslia is a very nice name,
hut why not stick lo the one which has done duty this
couple of thousand years or so? Zuleikha is just as good
ns it was when the modest Joseph left his garment with
her for a keepsake. According to the tradition, however,
Joseph grew in wisdom as lie grew in years, and when
Mr. Potiphar died (I believe he received a little assist-
ance) Mrs. Potiphar became Mrs. Joseph. Zadig.
George “ Joseph ’’ Waiters’ Biblical play seems to open
up prophetic possibilities. It reveals to the weary play-
wright, haggard wilh the ceaseless strain of idea-hunting,
an unworked field waiting to lie ploughed. Bland Holt
has already in his mind a spectacular production of
“Jonah," with full ocean-“set” and “practicable”
whale. (H. Parkes might bs specially engaged for
“lead.”) “ Before and After the Fall,” for scenic effects
and picturesque but iuexpensiv • costuming, will, no
doubt, in lime commend itself to librettisls and managers.
(A certain N.Q. functionary, when no longer permitted to
play the deuce, might lie persuaded to play Cain.) As
for tlie problem-play of the future, The Book will be in-
valuable as regards plots. “ David and Uriah,” and a
few oth Q r choice themes, dramatically treated, will biing
about the dethronement of Pinero, Ibsen, and On. for
evermore. But the true satire lies in the fact that it is
the parson who shows the way 1
As seen at a music-shop, the little Russian pianists
Hamhourg, is all yellow overcoat, from the tops of his
shoes right up to the tops of Ins ears, surmounted by a
huge top.hat, out of which his sleepy eyes peer
dreamily as he looks at nothing. Howells, ins bear-
leader, gives him a shake when lie wants him to notice
anything. Herr Mark’s head looks rather too big for
him when his hat is off ; but his odd-looking, dark little
face has got music written all over it. He generally sub-
sides into a chair directly lie conies in, and sits somnolent
and indifferent until stirred up again. But see him on
the racecourse !
Ada Crossley’s engagement to travel with Patti was
certainly not brought about by press recnmnr ndatu n.
Her detail proved a comparative frost artistically—she
didn’t show her voice at its lust—and (he newspapers,
with hardly an exception, ignored the concert altogether.
Next week she got one short notice for her singing at a
charity concert. Miss Crossley made the early mi-hake,
which might have proved a v ry serious matter to Iter, of
offending S intley. wims" influence with musical critics is
considerable. After starting as the baritone's pupil, she
suddenly and summarily took herself off to Paris and
Madame Marches!. Santley considered himself unpardon
ably affronted.
If Boucicaiilt said to a Bulletin correspondent (re the
production of “The Importance of Being Earnest): “Con-
sideration for the public doesn’t weigh so much with me
as the artistic satisfaction of doing something new and
doing it well,” he probably said it for publication, with a
smile concealed up his sleeve. Oscar’s com dy is as old
in spirit as W. S. Gilbert’s “ Engaged,” and it was about
the least well-done of all the joints ever served up by the
B. and B. co.

The S.M. Herald asks Lyne, the new
N.S. W. Opposition leader, not to attempt “to
flog the dead horse of Protection back to life.”
That isn’t the question at issue, or anything
faintly resembling it. The Herald should rather
implore Reid to start at oneft and flog the unborn
horse of Freetrade into existence, that animal
never having arrived yet in N.S.W. At present
it is Reid vvlio is trying to welt into activity the
deceased moke of the Lyne party by granting
Protection to the local pipe-making industry.
Y/hy not let each man wallop his own horse?
Sydney has provided a first-class horror.
A watchman, prowling round the unsavory shores
of Woollooraooloo Bay, on Ist inst., found a large
packing-case lying in a street extending down to
the water. From the case issued a fearful stench ;
the police were called to prise open the top ; and
the body of a woman covered with blood
was found inside. Medical examination showed
that apparently the Caesarean operation bad been
attempted : there was a deep gash in the abdomen,
made by skilled hands, and signs that a child
had been recently born. The woman was
young and good-looking, and her hands, in the
opinion of the daily-paper reporter, showed that
she was unaccustomed to toil of any kind. The
bottom fell out of the mystery within 24 hours
after the discovery. The girl was the daughter
of a farmer at Mulgrave, a few miles from Sydney.
She had “gone wrong” in the old, old way, and
her condition preyed on her mind. Her half-
demented threats of running away from home so
a'armed the mother that she locked away most of
her daughter’s clothes to prevent her departure ;
but the girl went out one morning scantily attired
in a wrapper and a cloak —the only costume
she could lay her bands on-and disappeared.
The police theory is that she came to Sydney and
fell into the hands of some of the ghouls who live
by illegal operations ; that the ghouls butchered
her in an unsuccessful attempt to earn their fee ;
and that they finally shoved the remains into a
box and dropped them in a back street in the
hope that they wouldn’t be traced. Four per-
sons belonging to a mysterious “ British Medi-
cal Association ” have since been arrested,
and, so the detectives allege, letters were
found on the premises showing that a large
and flourishing trade in abortion was carried
on. Probably similar evidences could be found in
forty other establishments in Sydney, that city
being notoriously the home of the abortionist. In
any case, the fact is sufficiently certain that the
deceased died through an attempt to procure
abortion.
The boot-manufacturers of Melbourne are
presenting Trenwith with £4OO, as bis eyesight is
failing (from cataract), and to restore it w’ill be an
expensive job. Generally it’s the other way :if a
politician has the bad hick to see things too
clearly, money is gathered to pay for his going
blind.
It is amusing to notice the sparring in
Bananaland Parliament over the Civil Service
vote. Until recently it looked as if the Labor
party were going to get the Civil Service support
at next election, but Boodlewraith came along
with refund of superannuation money, remission
of 10 per cent, salary deductions, and increases
for next year, and now !
The usual weekly leper has turned up in
the North. He was foreman at a Brisbane tan-
nery, and is supposed to have had the disease for
about a dozen years. During all that time lie lias
presumably scattered the germs of his complaint
around, and quite a crop of new lepers may be
expected by-and-bye.
Dear Bulletin, — Re your par. (Aug. 3)
regarding Woman’s Suffrage in S. A. So far from
Mrs. Birks, Mrs. Nicholls, and myself “not com-
ing into the field until the struggle was virtually
over,” Mrs. Birks has been treasurer (and a
splendid treasurer, too) from the league’s in-
ception to its dissolution. Mrs. Nicholls has
been on the council continuously from within
two months of the formation of the league;
while she and the W.C.T.U., of which she is
president, secured over 7000 out of the 11,000
signatures to the monster petition presented
to Parliament, and this may be taken as typical
of her share in the work generally. I never
“claimed a chief part in obtaining the franchise.”
Although I only joined the council on the Rev.
Hugh Gilmore’s death in 1801,1 publicly advocated
Woman’s Suffrage on the platform before Mrs,
Lee came to the province, and 1 helped the move-
ment in other practical ways long before joining the
Council. There has not been the slightest attempt
to “rob ” Mrs. Lee of any credit due to her for
her share in the fight. On the contrary, my
article in Jan. Review. OB' Reviews referred to
her twice, and in one place I said “the women of
South Australia ought to cherish the memory of
Lady Colton, Mrs. Birks, and Mrs. Lee, who have
practically been connected with the League from
its inception, and who have worked earnestly for
it ever since.” In addition to this, toy press copy
shows that I wrote this special commendation of
Mrs. Lee, which, however, did. not appear in the
printed article Mrs. Lee has been a particu-
larly active and effective newspaper correspondent
on the subject.” Her photo, would have been
published in the Review, but for the fact that
when I applied to her—as I did twice by letter
and once personally—she said she had not a photo,
which could be used for the purpose, having only
an old one taken before she came to the province.
The subscription for Mrs. Lee was really begun
by the members Of the Council who are charged
with being jealous of her; and they obtained
about .£l5, chiefly subscribed among themselves
and a dozen friends who recognised Mrs. Lee’s
useful work. —C. PnouD. [The Bulletin finds
on enquiry that Mr. Proud’s statements are
correct, and regrets the publication of the inac-
curacies in the paragraph which he complains of.]
The interest in Cellular Clothing is be-
coming widespread. The extent of application of
Cellular fabric is so large that it maybe said to
cover every variety of clothing for all seasons and
for all climates. iSinee the doctors recommend it,
and since it gives the maximum warmth with the
minimum weight, and is therefore peculiarly suit-
able for Australian climates, it is not surprising
to find it quickly superseding the old materials
used for underclothing. The sole agents for the
colony of Victoria are Messrs. Hicks, Atkinson
and Sons, of Collins-street. Economy is also
among the virtues of Cellular Clothing.*
Mr. Tom W. Furse, secretary of Sydney
Eight-hour Demonstration Committee, publishes
in this issue the full programme of sports to be
held in connection with the gala on Monday,
October 7, at Rosehill. He also wants the public
to understand that the tickets are operative in the
art union, whether the holders are present or not,
so that a purchase will be a paying investment,
even if the purchaser has no idea of going to the
big shivoo. It is better than trying to pick a
double, anyway. The entry-list for the band
contest has closed with 12 entries, which include
all the best bands ; and Wollongong, Bathurst,
Orange, Adamstown, Newcastle, and other coun-
try bands intend to make anything local blow the
plug out if it wants to win. The secretary is in
Ids office every Saturday, from 8 to 10 p.m., to
receive entries for the events on the sports-pro-
gramme.* 1

Ayer’s Sarsaparilla.
Mr. Charles Stephenson, a well-known
Kailway Employe at Kaiapoi,
New Zealand, writes;
“About ten years ago, while engaged in
shunting, my foot caught between the rails,
and my leg was fractured below the knee.
It healed in time, but I have been troubled
ever since with swollen veins, and have been
obliged, at times, to wear a bandage. About
a year ago it became much worse, and I
feared I should be obliged to give up my
work. A friend advised me to try Ayer’s
Sarsaparilla. I did so, and after taking four
bottles the swelling disappeared, and I have
not been troubled with it since.”

EXTRACTS
FROM
PRIVATE LETTERS.
“ It is with heartfelt grati-
tude I write to tell you of the
great benefit my little daugh-
ter Gladys has derived from
‘ Bengers Food.' The doctor
and all who saw her thought
we should never be able to
roar her. We took her to the
hospital, and the authori-
ties recommended ‘ lienger’s
Food.’ From that time she
began to pick up flesh and
strength.”
"If every mother knew of
its value no other would be
used.”
Melb. E. Herald v. Melb. E. News —the
Priests v. the Levites.
Era : Two medical items. In certain damp
dwellings cancer constantly recurs, and the tene-
ments thus become known to the medical profes-
sion as “ cancer houses.” It would be advisable
to have official records kept of the houses lived in
by all cancer patients. . . . Was at an Indian
eye-doctor’s, in Melb. lately. His assistant
came in and took his umbrella : “ he wanted to
grind some medicine with the handle,” he said.
Reminded me of the old story where the officer
finds his Hindoo servant straining coffee through
a sock, and receives the excuse that it isn’t a clean
one.
For true humor in journalism one must
go to the masonic organs. A brother refusing to
settle an advertising debt gets righteously cursed
for his flagrant offence by his brother who runs
the suffering rag. The fact that they have both
been sworn on the same sacred gridiron to love
one another evermore, is treated as a very trivial
detail compared with the awful wickedness of the
monster who doesn’t cash up. “We are averse to
publishing details of business matters which,
while concerning ourselves, might possibly be an
infliction upon our readers,” says Masonry
(Melb). Then the enraged publication proceeds
to shriek the details of a country case in which it
sued Brother somebody for 20s. and achieved a
glorious victory.
To remove freckles, pimples, &c.—see page 22.*
At Seymour (Yic.< Free Library recently,
a motion that The Bulletin be taken for the
reading-room was defeated—chiefly on the ground,
it would seem, that it was considered “a disloyal
paper.” The opposition was led by the inevitable
clergyman, whose name has not yet reached
this office. As this paper is run, not for
the good of its proprietors’ health, but
to a large extent for the filthy purpose
of making money—an end in nowise sub-
served by its being read gratis at Free Libraries—
The Bulletin co. will, as a token of gratitude,
and in accordance with its custom, post the
paper free to the rev. gentleman in question for
one year, if he will kindly supply his address.
The Prince of Wales, we read, gets 12 new
dress-suits every season, and uses three new silk
hats every fortnight, also two new frock-coats
monthly. In vain he strove to make the black
cut-away coat fashionable —the tall, slight young
men whom the frock-coat suited were too power-
ful, For a frock-coat the Prince pays .£l2, for a
dress-suit .£l5, for a tweed suit £llO to £ll2. He
is most particular as to fit, and the slightest crease
or wrinkle ensures instant return of the garment.
No alterations are allowed—a misfit ever so
trifling involves the building of a fresh coat or
what not de novo. Tummy pays 255. for a silk
hat, and his shirts, &c., cost him £1250 a year.
For boots, he pays £2 to £3 a pair, and always
has a score of pairs kept on lasts for immediate
use. He never wears a pair of gloves twice, and
probably spends £2OOO a year on clothes, apart
from uniforms.

Mes-rs. George Robertson and Co., of
3GI, 363 George-street, Sydney, have greatly
enlarged their fancy goods department, which
now contains almost every gaud that the soul of
man or women can desire. Among the leading
lines are purses, pocket-books, bags and the like
in a great variety of leather—crushed morocco,
French morocco, Moorish calf, crocodile, dog,
lizard, alligator, French calf, and the hide of
almost every other animal save the kraken
and the unicorn, and perhaps the bunyip.
The firm keeps a vast stock of purges,
card-cases, letter-cases, wallets, blotters, tourist
cases, photo, frames, hand-bags, memo.-books,
cigar and cigarette cases, all in artistic
tints, some of which are new, while all are
beautiful. Messrs. G. R. & Co. also supply every-
thing that comes under the heading of fancy
stationery ; find and emblazon arms, crests, and
mottoes ; prepare illuminated addresses for the
stout alderman who is going to Europe, book
plates, and monograms ; and do other things too
numerous to mention. Tire illuminating and
heraldic department is under the especial charge
of Mr. H. C. Skarratt.*
There are 31 lady missionaries from Aus-
tralia in China.
Hares are being hawked on Melb. Block

“At present there are not 50 European
cabinetmakers at work in Melbourne, whereas of
the smellful, uncleanly Chinese there are fully 500
busily engaged.”—Melb. Age.
At the International Chess Congress,
Lasker, British representative and world’s cham-
pion, defeated Steinitz, of the United States.
But Lasker (like his rival, Steinitz, and pretty
nearly all the other great chess-players) is essen-
tially a German.
Journalist: “I was engaged upon the
principal Melb. evening paper, when the overseer
came to me, with a rueful face, bringing No. 1,
vol. i., of a new rival. ‘ There’s a splendid
paper,’ isaid he. ‘Why,’ said I,‘there’s nothing
in it.’ ‘Ah,’ he rejoined, ‘but look at the
printing ! ’ Always the way with your overseer.
A book’s a book, although there’s nothing in it.”

A German resident of Melbourne is the
proud possessor of a few hairs from the head of

The celebrated firm of English perfumers,
J. and E. Atkinson, of London, who bottle up ail
the most delicate odours on earth and diffuse
sweetness over two hemispheres, five continents,
and many thousand square miles, lay particular
stress on the fact that their scents are obtained
from Nature’s flower-laboratory only. Therefore,
they advise that imitations chemically made from
garbage, and old iron, and coal-tar, and similar
materials be never sniffed as they pass by, for
obvious hygienic reasons.*

SPORTING NOTIONS.
Again; it is Respectable to be Wholesale. Cash-
betting has been carried on in Sydney (or close upon
three years, and one of the last men to lake it up was
Oxenham, kin* of the Sydney ring ; he adopted it some
two moiiills ago, and laiely the regular daily laying in
cash against him was £2OO. The enforcement of Terry’s
Betting-houses Suppression Act will stop all rash-betting
except upon the racecourse, but men with credit can bet
as freely now as they could under the cash-s\ stem. The
law in effect stops only the poor man from indulging his
passion for gambling; it squelches the little silver Juggins
unless he can attend meetings, but it gives the gold
Juggins as much play and opportunity as he can desire.
A Juggins is only a Juggins in relation to his
income, and the backer who, out of his silver earnings,
can spare half-a-crown upon his fancy is just as right and
wise as the richer man who can proportionately put lialf-
a-tbousand on his dead-bird. Tims the maxim, “one law
for the rich and another for the poor,” holds good in this
as in every other case, and the enforcement of the law
will give the gold Juggins the same liberty, the same
protection as heretofore, but will expose the silver
Juggins to the rapacity of the unregistered bookmaker,
who will wait for him in the streets and *• lay” him there,
or conduct him by back-ways and dark staircases into
veritable dens of thieves.
Men must gamble as they must love, figbt, and
drink. There is a great element, of gambling in every
business venture, and the only man Thb Bulletin knows
who hud none of the gambling spirit was a church elder
who, before taking the plate round each Sunday, would
back his own prospective collection against that of his
fellow elder. His was not a gambling spirit, but the
spirit undefiled which prompts a church-bazaar.
• • * *
Bookmaker Oxenliam on the recent raid on the
Sydney gambling shops: “Betting cannot be stopped,
and all attempts to arrest it are futile. The people of this
country will have betting, and it is useless to try and stop
them. . . There are places that never should have been
allowed to exist, and why the police did not suppress
them earlier I could never understand. They had the
power all the time, and it was onlv a question of enforcing
their authority. People have been talking about our
wanting a new' Act, but we wanted no new legislation at
all on this subject, for the laws already in existence gave
all the power that could possibly be wished for. The
police have done now' in five minutes what
have done at any time since the shops were opened. All
of which are immortal truths. The Sydney betting-shops
were illegal establishments which carried on their business
amid a glare of gaslight, and had their names conspicu-
omly printed on the big front window, and I heir addresses j
advertised in the papers in large black type. And as the
detective often took doubles and other wag rs himself, and
refused, even when he fell over the doorstep of the biggest
establishment of the lot, to be officially aware of its
existence, and the heads of the police didn t insist on him
being aware of it, and the Colonial Secretary for ears
took no steps to awake the force to a state of conscious-
ness on the subject—well, what was the cause of it all ?

The biggest tote in Melb. (suburban) is run by
i bookmaking firm, and run openly, for scores of women
ind children are to be seen banging about all day. Soy the

Tote opponents argue that the machine tends to
reduce the value of blood-stock. At a sale held at Kirk s
Bazaar (Melh.), the other day, out of eight horses put up
for auction only two were sold, and these reached the
exorbitant prices of 17 and 10 guineas respectively. And
yet the Totalisator Bill was thrown out by Vic. Parlia-
ment. _
m * • *
The Melbourne purists, having coalesced with
tiie bookies to smash the tote, have now joined forces
with the Tobacconists’ Association to squelch Sunday
trading in cigars. In return the Sabbatarians wanted the
I.A. to work with them in booming Murray’s Anti-
gambling Bill, but the tobacconists jib, every second
member of the T.A. being a Hebrew. In all these cases
union is strength for the Devil, as the purists are fighting
for th» impossible. Murray's latest effort is hopeless
merely a Murray cod, in fact.
• • * •
Certain pious and other Sydney city property-
holders have much reason to regret the suppression of
the totes. When the police ordered the proprietors to
close, under pain of arrest, most of them as a rule, they
are w'eekly tenants, and few have their shops on lease-
immediately gave notice to the landlord. The tote is
'liice Mrs. Seymour-Asbury) a “ model ” tenant. No com
plaints are made, or repairs asked, and the rent is always
paid promptly. * * •
Threepenny wagers were being taken on the
private totes on Flemington flat on Saturday week. One
of thes» was run by a man whose wife acted as clerk.
These private totes —which do fully 30 per cent, of the
flat wagering—annex 25 per cent, c mniission and nil
fractions, often amounting to another 10 per cent, or 15
percent. In the case of Raak, some who backed the
winner didn’t even get their money hack, the support
accorded to others not being sufficient to pay commission.

Placke’s straightforward challenge to swim any

Cricket king Grace, by July 8 this English
season, had scored 1638 rung in 23 innings. In Gentlemen
v. Players, at Lord’s, in scoring 118, he made his fifth
century this season on that ground. Mold, tip to the
date noted, led the English howlers with 112 wickets for
13 - 29 runs a wicket; Richardson had 120 at 15T ; Peel,
72 at 15-56.
* • • •
Probably Grace’s medical training lias assisted
him in taking good care of himself; hut, all the same, no
other big sport would have allowed him lo last so long.
There is neier the prolonged and terrible tension in
cricket that there is in boxing, wrestling, racing, sculling,
cycling and football. If a batsman gets winded in cricket
he can take it easy until lie gets his wind hack, hut in
other sports the man who stops to get Iris wind disappears
from the ranks of competitors. Cricket is more recreative
than arduous.
• * • ♦
That total of 1000 rims scored by Murdoch in
first-class matches this English season, does not look such
a feat beside W. G. Grace's total of considerably' over 2000.

No Australian team in England has netted per
man for the trip less than £4OO ; the most successful team
financially was Dave Gregory’s, which brought each man
close on £BOO nett. Consequently-, the proposal that
each of the next Aus. Eleven shall receive lint £2OO will
raise a hubbub. The English pros, last tour received
expenses and £3OO.

M‘Laren’s great score of 424 for Lancashire
against Somerset is one of those wonderful feats which
result from a batsman reaching the pink of perfect form,
while the day and the wicket combine for his success.
Having mastered the howling, he never gave a chance up
to 262. Nineteen years ago Grace put up the former
county-match best with 318 for Gloucestershire against
Yorkshire. Then the young M’Laren was scarcely walk-
ing, hut the famous Grace, on averages, is still, as then,
the champion of England.

Men who stood to win or lose hundreds on a
horse at Saturday’s races did not raise one particle of the
barbarous din which came from the Wallaroo or Hand wick
harracker at Sydney Agricultural Ground. The Wallaroo*
had a little the liest of it at the start, hut several of their mm
were temporarily laid out, and towards the end of the first
half the hall itself was pulled out of the scrum, crushed
into a flat piece of leather. Just about this time, too, a
Wallaroo forward got his collarbone broken, but he came
out for tlie second half to fight over the hall as if his life’s
destiny depended on it. The whole of the second half tin
play was vicious, and probably the least vicious player
was one who struck a blow at a foe with the clenched flsl;
the rest of the combatants tried to choke each other or
break each other’s backs, and often the fool hall’s presence
seemed hut a shallow excuse for assault and battery. A
tremendous run by the Randwick Jumbo brought Du-
play early upon the Wallaroo line. Now and again a
play er would get laid out, and the crowd roared with
laughter at the way the downed man «ould totter about
for some minutes after as he tried to collect his senses.
Blood ran freely. Many women were crying, and one girl
was in hysterics. Nearly the whole of the second half lie
hall.le was fought close upon the Wallaroo line, and at any
moment Randwick promised to score. In the last five
minutes, however, a tough rush by Wallaroo forced the
play right back to the Randwick line, and there it siood
when the umpire’s whistle went, with both sides having
scored nothing, afier ttie most savagely contested match
seen in Sydney for many a day.

half-plates for view, two dark slides, a clarionet, a bundle
of music, beef, bread and other provisions. Coming down

St. Alban’s Revisited .
A GLANCE AT THE HORSES
[BY A TICKET-HOLDER.]
Being in Geelong last week I thought I would
like to see St. Alban’s again before the lottery, and,
driving over, was fortunate enough to find Mr.
Macdonald at home. The gardens and carriage-
drive approaching the house were in beautiful
ofder and betokened an early spring. Near the
stables we came on old Robinson Crusoe just
about to be turned out for his daily exercise ; and
well did the old sailor look despite his advancing
years. Ho cornea from a long-lived family, and
may yet sire the equal of Trident or Navigator—
two of the best racehorses that ever looked
through a bridle. Bill of Portland has
much improved since his arrival, and now pre-
sents a very handsome, racer-like appearance.
He is massive, and yet shows a deal of the quality
which the progeny of St. Simon are so noted for.
Eiridspord is as strong and muscular as ever,
while Strathmore has improved in every way.
Any of these horses separately would command
respect, but when Trenton appears he is the choice
of all good judges. Trenton is now in the prime
of life; and if his destination should be England
or America, in appearance, at least, he will hold
his own against any horse living. Many of the
best studmasters are making use of him this
season; but I hope some patriotic Australian will
win him and keep him in the country.
We were just in time to see the horses in train-
ing on the track, and although only doing slow
work they struck me as being in very good order
for this time of the year. Wallace has grown and
furnished; bub whether he, Challenger, or Trent-
hara is good enough to win the Derby I know not,
and when I asked the imperturbable Macdonald
which he fancied he quietly answered, “ Oh, any
one of them is good enough ! ” May be, but my
racing education has taught me that there have
never been three Derby colts in one stable in one
year. However, they all look well, and both Chal-
lenger and Wallace have performances to recom-
mend them. Carnage is bright and mellow, while
Merman grows more like Patron every day. Brad-
ford and Redcomb are, I think, only moderates ;
but Havoc looks as if he had completely recovered
from his accident, and has evidently done a good
deal; of work. The two-year-old unbroken colts
were in a paddock close by, and a very fine lot
they are. The Trenton-Umilta colt is a weight-
for-age horse in appearance. Nob so strong, bub
very neat, is the half-brother by Trenton to Boz ;
while the half-brother to Wallace by Strathmore
is quite as big and strong as some of the
competitors at the late Grand National meet-
ing. Turning up a lane, we came on a chest-
nut mare with a very large foal. This was
no other than Mersey, the dam of Carbine.
Her filly foal was dropped some time in March,
and is strong and good-looking; but unfortunately
will not be fib for racing purposes owing to an
accident at her birth. The old mare does not
appear in foal, but, as she would be very late,
there is no certainty that she is not. A little
further afield were four mares who had dropped
Ms during the preceding night. Pardon, a fine
colt to Eiridspord ; Umilta, a filly to Trenton.
Hatason and See-Saw had also foals, but their sex
I do not remember, although both were by Eirids-
pord. There are some 35 mares yet to foal, so
that there will be a very good percentage this
year. Among the mares in that happy condition
were Nightmare, La Tosca, She, Coin, Bonnie
Rosette, and Solitude; but Hypatia and Aura
show no signs of motherhood.
Leaving the mares, Mr, Macdonald took me
round by the irrigation works, which appear in
excellent order, but the quantity of grass on the
estate prevents them from being used very often.
Still, they would be useful in a dry season.
Along the river a new training-track has been
commenced, and it is intended to give the wind-up
gallops to the Derby and Cup horses here. A fair
amount of crop has been put in, while all the
stock on the estate are in good condition, and
there is lota of grass.
On our homeward route we interviewed the
yearling colts, and very inquisitive little fellows
we found them. The brother to Auraria does not
belie his parentage, and is as handsome as his
celebrated sister—-which is saying a good deal in
his favor. Bonnie Rosette, the imported mare by
Barcaldine, is also represented by a very fine colt;
and several by Eiridspord show good size and
shape. However, yearlings at this season of the
year are in the growing stages, and it will no
doubt suffice those who hope to win them to know
that they are in excellent health and condition,
and appear in every way worthy to take a high
place on the turf.
On the training-track I noticed that a starting-
machine had been erected, and one of the men
was going over the outer track with the harrows.
During my walk I came across the ostriches, and
was told that they had a sitting of eggs, each egg
being about the size of a football!
I had another look at the horses in training in
the stables, and, scanning them with the eye of
one who might be their owner, I must confess I
was greatly pleased. Mr. Macdonald does not
view the lottery with any kindly feeling, for he
says Mr. Wilson has had the bad luck to run
third twice, and second once, in the Melbourne
Oup in four years ; and he has never had a better
stableful of horses than at present. Now, no one
knows who will own them on sth November!
One thing which strikes the casual visitor to
St. Alban s is the forethought which has been em-
ployed in laying out the estate. Everything
seems to have been designed to carry on an im-
mense stud-farm ; and except that the training-
stables are a little too near the house, I very much
doubt if any better arrangement of the various
offices could be devised. As it was late when we
got through, Mr. Macdonald kindly asked me to
stay the night, and very comfortable he made me.
In the morning I drove away, hoping more fer-
vently than ever that Dame Fortune would for
once smile on me and allow my name to be on
the winning tickets of the St. Alban’s Estate.*
Madame Palma, the Sydney palmist, con-
fuses the average man’s opinion of the sexes by
declaring her best trade is with men, Male
clients, however, are mostly anxious about busi-
ness matters ; the females are generally girls burn-
ing to know who will marry them, or old ladies in
trouble. The deep lines of Parkes’s hand, says
the chiromancer, denote power of deep thought
—but no hand could be less like a poet’s. All
sorts of fish come to Madame Palma’s handy-net.
She read the hand of divorce-conspirator Butler a
month ago; also Mrs. Copp’s. Several Aus-
tralian Judges’ wives have waited upon her. Even
Raymond Blathwayt, interviewah, called and
took a chart away with him.

FREIGHTS.
The Victorian Railway Department notifies that
for Victorian-grown wools it will in future
charge for actual weight in nen of charging at so
much per bale, as formerly. It is inconceivable
why the Department held so long to an unjust
and inequitable practice. The decision of the
Commissioners in this matter will be appreciated
by wool-growers. Doubtless, the untiring agita-
tbis a ma<3e b 3J , tbe National
Wool Company, of Melbourne, will he recollected,
the company having distinctly scored in carrying
this point.*
When a workman in Melbourne sues for
wages due these times, the godly employer very
often gets into the box, and sadly informs the
Bench that he merely employed the fellow out of
charity, and the money already paid to him
(average about 3|d. an hour) was more than was
stipulated. Then the combined Bench frowns
dreadfully upon the horny-handed ingrate, and
severely dismisses the case, with some caustic
reflections upon the unconscionable greed of the
laboring classes.

THE EARL OF GARRICK
Has successfully tried “ Homocea.” Writing
from Mount Juliet, Thomastown, he says:—
“It is the most wonderful stuff I ever came
across. Please send me three boxes. I gave
some to a labourer of mine who had a bad boil
on his leg, and was quite lame. I saw him after
four days, and asked him what the ‘' Homocea ”
did for him. He said he was entirely cured ; his
wife, besides, had had a pain in her elbow, so
that she could not bend her arm for a year, and
it cured that. I also gave some to a woman with
a bad leg, and it is doing her good.”

You need not put off your canter
for the sake of a premonitory cold,
with Homocea as a protector.
A cold begins with inflammation of the membra
neous lining of the intricate little passages of the
nose (which is a Hampton Court labyrinth on a
Sinall scale). Homocea at once subdues the in
flammation by reducing the swelling, and thereby
relieving the feeling of “stuffiness." Moreover, it
forms a protective covering for the delicate mem
brane, and prevents cold air, or other irritating
vapour from getting at it. In influenza, Homocea
acts in the same way, and here the germ-killing
properties of the ointment further come into play
Not much is known about the way in which influ
enza originates, but it is quite clear that it is caused
by an invisible germ or microbe of some kind.
Homocea may,therefore, be confidently recomended
both as a cure and a preventive of influenza.
HOMOCEA v. RINGWORM CURED.
Hoylake, 19 Aug., 1893.
“Dear Sirs,—l want to thank you for that
wonderful preparation, ‘ Homocea,’ which we
use for about everything ; but lately my little girl
had a bad ringworm on the head, and my doctor
said her hair would have to be cut close. But I
preferred using the ‘ Homocea,’ and in four days
it was quite well, and the doctor said I ought to
give you a testimonial, and I think so too. —
Yours truly. “ M. Aldred.”
Lady Keane has much pleasure in recoin-
mending Homocea as an invaluable remedy for
rheumatism, cuts, bruises, piles, sprains, &c. ;
she thinks so highly of it that she would not be
without it in the house, as it has entirely cured
her of iheumatism and other ailments. She can

BARON BERZILIUS’ REPORT.
They are chiefly given in complaints of the Urinary
Organs, such as Gravel, Chronic Catarrh, morbid Irrita-
tion of the Bladder and Urethra, Diseases of the Prostrate
Glands, and Retention or Inconvenience of Urine, from
the loss of tone in the parts concerned in its evacuation.
These Bitters I also recommend in Dyspepsia, in Chronic
Rheumatism and Cutaneous affections. The action of
Buchu on the human frame is more effectual on all
diseases of the Kidneys and Bladder than any other herbal
plant; and it also assists persons suffering from Skin
Diseases, causing a healthy action of the secretions and
inducing perspiration.
Read what Medical men say about them—
BJERKIN, M.D. : —The Bitter is pure, and not like
others in overdoses. It has a remarkable influence on the
liver, promoting the secretions - f Bile, and correcting it
when deranged, and restores healthy evacuations in oases

D. ECKSTROM, M.D.-8888-I find thtse Bitters a
most valuable anil wholesome tonic, being pure and
strengthening; a stimulant to the liver, assisting diges-
tion. 1 therefore thus recommend them.

! A well-known medical referee lately told The
Bulletin that a life-assurance agent who has sent him
numerous proponents to examine invariably demands
from the doctor 2s. 6d. per case sent. When the doctor
kicked at first, the agent calmly replied that if he did not
get that half-crown com. he would bring over the doctor
from the next town to do the examination. Further, the
agent stated that the societies are more or less aware of
this practice. Agents are usually paid nothing for cases
the doctor does not pass, so the live canvasser makes sure
beforehand of half-a-crown or five shillings out of the
guinea the society must pay the doctor whether the case
passes or not. Which means that if such a canvasser
went and rounded up all the unemployed he could find,
he would do a good day’s work. Twenty wrecks certain
of refusal would, at ss. a head, pan out £5 to the drover,
and probably they would think a pint of sheoak excellent
pay. And such a trick would mean £2l transferred by
a swindle from the coffers of the society to the pockets of
a scoundrelly canvasser and his medical partner, or medi-
cal dupe, as the case might be.

lb is averred that a potent factor in the ruin of
a once-prosperous section of the Melb. hotel-trade has
been the privileges conferred by police and excise

buying from the publicans of their neighborhood. In a
word, the most fashionable “notorious” houses of Mel-

been filled with sacks covered on top with wood. Bluff

success is based. (‘Hear, hear.’) Confidence is built on

Dear Bulletin, —Jews are bad, Christians
worse. The Jew asks his big per shent right out and
that’s all, hut whether the Christian asks more or less he
is sure to double it with commission and fees of all sorts.
The Jew is an avow'ed Shylock, but ti e Christian is a
churchgoer who squeezes you per a shady agent. Had
dealings with one of the latter, whose principal—a
suburban medico—lives opposite. Every quarter when I

The deterioration of explosives in the North is
a serious danger, and attention was again directed in Q.
Leg. Assembly, the other day, to the need for appointing
an Insp* dor of Explosives. The main cause of accidents
in the North, however, is the greed for divs. and the con-
sequent rushing of the men. The law says that when-
ever a hole has missed fire an hour must elapse ere work
is resumed in that particular spot, but the rule is a dead-
’elter.

Re another buried miner. It was at an old
quartz-mine near Hushworth (Vic.). The man had been
caught in a small drive through a rush of stowage, and
the rescue entailed hours of hard and unremitting labor.
At last, by a piece of extraordinary luck—the loose reef
having been held back from a narrow aperture by a long
leg the rescue party were able to reach their man and
haul him out of the little pitch-dark den in which he had
been squatting for 18 hours, speculating upon his chances
of the Kingdom. The rescuers were most enthusiastic,
and cheered like maniacs, but the rescued was apparently
indifferent. The only remark he passed when the row
had subsided was, “ Well, you needn’t have made such an
infernal fuss about it!’’

Experiments at Grubbs’ mill have led Tas.
Govt. Geologist Montgomerie to conclude that the
“ float ’’-losses from the treatment of West Coast silver ore
approach £150,000 yearly. Thus the wet process is
alleged to steal one-third of the whole silver treated. It
is not usual, at Zeehan, to assay the heaps before treat-
ment by the different mills, and until this is done no com-
plete investigation of the matter can be said to have been
made. At the same time it is significant that the returns
from the mills are nearly always far below the yields
anticipated by the public. The public is an ass, of
course, but in this case it seems to have drawn only a
rational inference from the numerous assays made before
the mills were erected. At Grubbs’ Frue vanners are
used, whilst at the Western the Luhrig has been adopted.
The “float” silver is supposed to be contained in the
sulphides in such fine particles as to be carried away by
the water beyond the tailings. An assay of these heaps,
therefore, gives no idea whatever of the mills’ losses.

The gold output of the Rand (Johannesburg,
South Africa) still rises, and for June passed the 200,0000 z.
mark. Aggregate yield for each month of this year;—
Jan., 177,4630 z. ; Feb., 169,2950 z.; March, 184,9450 z. ;
April, 186,3230 z. ; May, 194,5800 z. ; June, 200,9410 z. In
June, ’B7, the output was 7340 z.! The M’Arthur-Forrest
(cyanide) and other chemical processes are now respon-
sible for over 60,0000 z. per month, mostly from tailings.
Last year the Transvaal, of which the Rand forms part,
stood third on the list of gold-producing countries, Aus-
tralia and the United States being ahead of it; but this
year the Rand output will, it is expected, exceed
2,500,0000 z. ; and neither Australia nor the U.S. will get
ahead of this—in ’95, at any rate, whatever Westralia may
help the former to do in ’96.
Compare this 200,0000 z. (monthly) output with
the best that Australia’s oldest reefing field has done.
Bendigo’s best year was ’53, when 661,7490 z. was got
(mostly, it is true, from alluvial); next best, 609,7290 z. in
’56. In no other year did it exceed 500,0000 z. Ballarat’s
total in 54 years just passed 18 million ounces.
In Johannesburg they reckon upon an output of
500,0000 z. per month four years hence! “At the very
lowest computation,” the local Standard and Diggers’
News says, “ 7000 stamps will be at work on these fields.”
500,0000 z. a month—6,ooo,OOOoz. a year ! The premier
mine now is the Langlaate estate (13,0000 z. for June),
followed by the Robinson (12,5810 z.), New Primrose
(12,018 oz.), and Crown Reef (11,2590 z.).

Sir —I hereby beg to certify that having been a sufferer from
General Debility of the Nervous System for over seven years, and
having tried without success several of the leading doetore both in
Sydney and Melbourne, I was advised to try your Alfahne Remedies.

A Wonderful Cure.
Herr Rassmussen. . August, 1894.
Dear Sir,—ln the year of 1871 I was eight days in the water sheep-
washing, and contracted rheumatism and stiffness in the joints, and
have tried all advertised medicines. When I came to Sydney I had a
great difficulty in walking, and went to the ’iurkish baths, which did
no good. Passing your window I saw a testimonial from Mr. E. W.
O’Sullivan, M.P., with the same complaint as I had, which led me to
try vonr Remedies. On Thursday before Good Friday I took the first
of your Pills ; since then I have used 4 boxes Special Powerful Alfaline
Vitality Pills, 3 boxes Special Powerful Alfahne Rheumatic Pills, with
Liver and Kidney Pills, and free use of your Alfaline Eucalyptus Oil,
and I am now, with the blessing of God, as well in health as I was 23
years ago. I can with great confidence recommend your Remedies to
anyone suffering from the same complaint. May you long be spared
under God to be a blessing to suffering humanity.
I remain, dear sir, yours very gratefully, dOHJN KLA Y.

CHOUGHS, COLDS ON THE CHEST, BRON-
/ CHITIS AND ASTHMA RAPIDLY
CURED BY Hearne’s Bronchitis cure.
Those who have taken this medicine are amazed
at its wonderful influence. Sufferers from any
form of bronchitis, distressing cough, difficulty of
breathing, hoarseness, pain or soreness in the
chest, experience delightful and immediate relief,
and to those who are subject to colds on the chest
it is invaluable, as it effects a complete cure. It
is most comforting in allaying tickling and irrita-
tion in the throat, and giving strength to the voice,
and it never allows a cough or asthma to become
chronic. No house should be without it, as, taken
at the beginning, adose is generally sufficient,
and a complete cure is certain.
“We, the undersigned, have had occasion toobtain
HEARNE’S BRONCHITIS CURE,
and we certify that it is perfectly and rapidly suc-
cessful under circumstances which undoubtedly
prove its distinct healine power.” Signed by
Rev. JOHN SINCLAIR, Myers-street, Geelong,
and 59 other leading residents.
“Mr. W. G. Hearne,
“Dear Sir, —Some months ago my little boy got
very ill with bronchitis. My wife heard of your
Bronchitis Cure and got a bottle of it. The first
dose eased him, and less than half the bottle com-
pletely cured him. We always keep it in tRe
house now. I persuaded a friend of mine to try
it; he did so, and it was just as successful with
his children. You are at liberty to make what
use you like of this, as I consider your Bronchitis
Cure to be a boon that cannot be too widely
known ; in fact, I cannot speak too highly of it.
—Yours very truly, ARTHUR G. JAMES,
Golden Square, Bendigo.
“Dear Sir,—l have much pleasure in informing
you that my father has been improving ever since
he started taking your Bronchitis Cure, and now
all signs of bronchitis have disappeared.—Yours
respectfully, THOS. PAYNE, Junr., Bloomfield,
Everton.”
“Will Mr. Hearne please send a bottle of his
Bronchitis. Cure ? I had one two or three months
ago which effected a speedy cure.—J. WYATT,
Newtown, Geelong.”
“Dear Sir,—l had occasion to use your Bron-
chitis. Cure, and have been completely cured by
it.—Yours faithfully, J. H. WILLIAMS, Merles-
wood, Elsternwick.”

‘ THE LAST OF SIXA
From the Maranoa : One Symons was
riding to Yingerbay village, 14 miles, from Roma.
Within half a mile of town, he observed to a
mate—“ Well, we’ve got this far without any
accident. I suppose we’ll get home all right,
now.” Not five minutes later a dead tree, stand-
ing near the road, fell as they were passing, a
limb striking Symons on the head and knocking
him off his horse. Only injury—a scalp wound.
Not a breath of wind was stirring at the time.
Next!
Asserted that the cocaine habit is largely
on the increase in Australia, especially among
doctors. Cocaine certainly makes the user feel
youthful and lively, augments his capacity for
work, and does away with the need of sleep ; but
this apparently beneficial effect does not last long
—not even so long as that of morphine. The bitter
after-results are manifested earlier and are more
disastrous. Cocaine-takers are utterly unreliable,
and careless of their personal appearance. While
under the drug’s power they are happy, hopeful,
and equal to anything. Without it they are
nervous, morose, even dangerous. Cocaine is
about the quickest of all roads to a hell on earth.
The only known cure for influenza is Cole-
mane and Sons Eucalypte Extract.
A correspondent : —ln the Wilcannia and
Willyama (Broken Hill) land district of N.S. W.
over million acres of Crown land is open to
selection by homestead or improvement lessees.
Of this l| million acres are in one county—
Evelyn, Milparinka district. Most of it is a
desert, officially described as “ sandy soil in arid
country;” if there were no rabbits and it were
watered, its carrying capacity would probably
average a sheep to 12 or 14 acres. Much of this
country, being altogether without natural or con-
served water, has been absolutely abandoned by
the pastoral lessees ; it is not even held under
occupation license or annual lease. Thus aban-
doned, it is occupied by rabbits which die by tens
of thousands during every drought and increase
by twenties of thousands after every rain, when
they spread out over the surrounding country,
undoing all the work of destruction which the
lessees have done during all the months before.
It is most necessary, therefore, that these wholly
abandoned lands should be occupied ; occupation
is the only cure for the rabbit-disease. But the
largest area which any person can lease is 20,480 ac.
as an improvement lease, or 10,240 acres as a
homestead lease ; and as the land is so wretchedly
poor—the larger area, even if well watered, could
not be relied upon to maintain more than a thou-
sand sheep—nobody will look at the country.
The Legislature, in dealing with Crown lands,
keeps its mind on the lands which bring in an
annual rent of from 4d. to Is. per acre, and acts
accordingly ; hence in measure after measure no
adequate provision is made for the most necessary
occupation of the millions of acres of rabbit-
infested country which, even were there no rabbits,
would be dear at a-third of a penny.
For coughs, colds you can’t beat Colemane
and Sons Eucalypte Extract.*
The platypus has furthur distinguished
himself. First, he astonished the scientists by
wearing a bill like a duck; then his wife, not to be
outdone, shook them up by laying eggs. Not
content with being a beast and a bird at the same
time, old man platypus has shown now that, while
he is about, there need be no demand for snakes,
for he can take on the contract himself. Horne in
1802 noticed on the male platypus’s hind legs a
pair of spurs, and thought they had to do with
his courtship and marriage. But Jamieson, in
1807, seeing the results of spur-wounds in men
and dogs, declared the spur was a poison weapon.
Bennett and Owen pooh-poohed the ides, but bush-
men generally stuck to the poison theory. Then
along came Prof. Anderson Stuart, and said the
bushmen were right. To settle the matter once
for all, Drs. Martin and Tidswell, of Sydney,
have now shown by careful dissection that in each
thigh there is a secreting gland connected by a
duct with a sac immediately behind the spur,
which has an outlet through the spur. Chemical
analysis showed the secretion to contain albumin-
ous proteids, but no nuclear-albumen, and experi-
ments on animals showed it was poisonous.
Platypus venom resembles snake venom in (1)
owing its poisonous power to proteids, (2) re-
tarding or preventing coagulation of the blood
when slowly introduced into the system in small
doses, (3) causing clotting within the vessels if in-
troduced in larger doses directly into the blood-
stream, (4) causing an immediate drop in blood-
pressure, (5) causing capillary hemorrhage and
cedema whem locally applied. So the platypus
suckles its young like a mammal, has a bill and
lays eggs like a bird, lives in or out of water like a
frog, and poisons his aggressors like a snake.
Nervous sufferers will find it worth their
while to peruse Herr Rassmussen’s advt. on page
23 of this issue.
“ Letter-carriers in Fiji,” writes a corres-
pondent, “hand you your missive in a very graceful
way. They carry a long reed, split at one end to
hold the letter. A friend of mine lately sent me
a note by one of these picturesque messengers,
around whom there seemed to be a poetic halo
until I opened the letter: ‘Give bearer two bob
and a biscuit for me, I haven’t a thing in the
house; see you later.’ ’*

The Passing of Parker .
[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
No, you “ 'aren't ’eard of Parker,” as was with us
in The Bay,
An’ you “ ’aven’t dropped acrost ’im in yer
cruises,” as you say ;
An’ you ain’t a-go’n’ to meet ’ira, for ’e’s safe an’
snug is Joe—
If the fishes ’asn’t eat ’im—fifty fathom down
below;
Gawd rest ’is Weedin’ bones,
’E ’as gone to Davy Jones,
An’ I ’opes, as passun told us, that ’is soul is with
the Lord,
For ’e slid down like a plummet,
’E went quick an’ lively summat;
Two shots about ’is feet, mate, an’ two above ’is
’ead
When ’e dived astarn one raornin’ like a bloomin’
chunk o’ lead.
Now, we’ll ’ave a pipe o’ baccy an’ another sip o
rum,
An’ we’ll drink to ole Joe Parker, an’ I’ll tell you
’ow it come:
We was on the China station, in the ’arbor of
Shanghai
(An’ the cuss o’ Gawd upon it for a dirty ’ole,
sez I),
In the port o’ Nagasaki
(Ta, that's decent baccy),
Up to bloomin’ “Daddy Stock-Pot”* where the
cold ’ud freeze a man,
Back again to Yokohama an’ the south’ard o’
J ap.i n.
Then a-cruisin’, cruisin’, cruisin’,
For some gory fool's amusin’,
With “Sir Stinker Jones” an’ “ Toecaps ”t on a
nasty, choppy sea,
An’ a extry dose o’ drillin’ —Gawd above! it
sickened me.
Waal, we’re back at Shanghai, messmate, an’ that
bloomin’ place o’ sin ;
We are raakin’ pretty lively when a Rooshun ship
comes in,
An’, of course, that starts the rowin’ in the drums
an’ pubs, ashore,
For a Rooshun is a Rooshun, an’ ’e can’t be any
more,
An’ as Britons we despise ’em,
An’ in fightin’ times chastise ’em,
For our vittles an’ our medals an’ our kiddies an’
our wives—
’Sides, I ’ates them Weedin’ Rooshuns, ’cause they
always carries knives.
So, from arguin’ an’ skitin’,
One fine night it comes to fightin’,
An’ they stiffens out a jolly—though for that I
wouldn’t grieve,
But Ole Toecaps ’ears about it an’ ’e stops a week
o’ leave.
Waal, we goes ashore again, mate, when our pun-
ishment is done,
An’ our fellers starts a-boozin’ in a pub. they calls
“The Sun,”
An’a Rooshun chivvies Parker, in is lingo, so ’e
said,
An’ Joe ’auls off an’ ’its ’im—such a wonner
on the ’ead 1
Gawd ! there wa’ant a blessed windy
But we busted in that shindy ;
There was broken glass an’ bottles, beer an’ Wood
along the floor ;
Oh, we played the very devil with the woman’s
furuitoor,
There was picters torn an’ labels,
An’ we broke the chairs an’ tables,
Smashed the mugs an’ things to blazes, turned ’er
over ’old an’ deck ;
Till you never see, so ’elp me, such a gawd-aban-
doned wreck!
Aye! we gev ’em “Rule Britannia,” but a
Rooshun’s ’ard to beat,
An’ we ’eard that more was cornin’, so we slips
along the street,
Through the foreign quarter runnin, through
them narrer, dirty lanes,
For we didn’t want no trouble with Ole Toecaps
for our pains.
It was dark as ’ell an’ darker,
So we never knew that Parker
’Ad been stiffened in the scrimmage by a flyin’
whisky-jar
An’ was layin’ on ’is stummick in a ’eap behind
the bar.
Fust we thought ’ed gone to glory—
Which ’ad ended up me story,
But ’e comes aboard next mornin’ with ’is top-
piece in a sling,
An’ Ole Toecaps ’ears about it, an’ performs like
anything.
But it wa’ant no use to Parker, so our ole ship’s
doctor said,
For |ed got a brain oon-oushion on the inside of
’is ’ead,
An’ ’e couldn’t do ’is duty for ’is case was criti-oal,
So they ’ad to give ’im treatment in the Weedin’
’ospital.
’E was gettin’ wuss an’ ravin’
Till they gev ’is ’ead a shavin’.
For to do a operation that they reckoned very
fine,
But I want no sawbones foolin’ round a broken
’ead o’ mine—
’Cause they out that ’ere con-cushion
That was gev him by the Rooshun
From the inside of his top-piece, an’, as true as
there’s a ’ell,
They took out a bit o’ skull-bone ’bout as big as
that ! as well.
Waal, Ole Toecaps gets ’is orders, an’ we says
“ Good-bye ” ashore,
An’ the engineers is ready an’ we ’eads for Singa-
pore.
Joe ’e feels a trifle better on the fust day out at
sea.
But the next day out ’e’s goin’ an’ ’e asks ’em
send for me,
Gawd ! I ain’t a cove for oryin’
But I ’ates to see ’im dyin’,
So I aits beside ’is ’ammock an’ I tries to cheer ’is
’eart,
Though ’e’s groanin’ somethin’ ’orrid, an’ ’is lips
is wide apart.
There’s a lump inside me throat, mate,
An’ I’m feelin’ like a goat, mate,
So I sings out, “Cheer up, messmate, cheer up,
Parker ! cheer up, Joe !
Pull yer bleedin’ self together, give ole Davy
Jones the go!”
Gawd ! ’E stares me white an’ ’orful with ’is ’ead
all bandaged up,
But ’e couldn’t make no answer till I let ’ira
’ave a sup ;
Then sez lie, “I’ve got my papers, ’taint no
tearin’ use,” sez he,
“That ere Rooshun’s put my lights out,” an’’e
glares like ’ell at me.
“ Cuss the crimson gory Rooshun
As ’as give you that con-cushion,
But it weren’t my fault, Parker,” in a bloomin’
funk, sez I.
“ No, old man, I knoiv it weren't /” , , An’ I
thought I’d ’ave to cry ;
But I ’ate them women’s squealin’s,
So I cussed —to ease me feelin’s —
All the dirty furrin’ varmints up an’ down an’ all
I could,
An’ ’e brightened as ’e ’eard me an’ I see it did
’im good !
“Ned,” sez’ee, “you’ll go to Chatham, see the
Missus an’ the kid ?”
“ Joe,” sez I, “ I won’t forget it nor neglect it,
Gawd forbid ;
But you ain’t a-dyin', messmate, you ain’t turning
turtle yet ?”
But ’e shook ’is ’ead and muttered orful feeble,
“Don’t forget.”
Fust’e lay awhile a-dreamin’,
Then ’e started up a-soreamin’ :
“ Blarst all Rooshun dogs to bl.izes I”—ripped the
bandage from ’is ’ead,
Clawed the bloomin’ air a minute, dropped ’is
’ands and flopped back —dead.
Then that bloomin’ Doctor Oarker
Comes along to look at Parker,
An’ I ’ears the sinner mutter ’fore they orders me
away,
“ Too much cuttin’to recover V’ What a bloomin’
shame, I say 1
So they sewed ’im in ’is ’ammock, as accordin’ to
the rule,
’Fore ’e’d stiffened out, I reckon, or ’ad time
enough to cool,
An’ we ’ears the bosun pipin’in the mornin’-watch
all-right,
’Sif they’d got to feelin’ sorry ’cause they kept ’im
over-night.
For it’s run ’em out, an’ shove ’em,
Get the water quick above ’em,
When a Jack is dead ’e’s done for an’ ’is body ain’t
no use,
’E ’as skipped ’is earthly dooty an’ ’is troubles
an’ abuse.
Sew ’is ’ammock up around ’im,
Chuck ’im overboard an’ drowud ’im,
For there’s no one wants to worry an’ there’s no
one got to weep
When the chaplain starts “ Oommittin’ this ’ere
body to the deep !”
“Fall in alt, there, tun’ral party ” —an’ they tells
’em wot to wear.
“ Mess one to ten, two men from each !” an’ don’t
them two men swear.
“ Chaplain’s ready 1 Rig yer gratin’ ! Fire three
volleys !”—rattle ! bang !
Someone shoves the bloomin’ body—gone ! and
no one cares a ’ang.
PT’aps in failin’ that poor feller
Struck ’is bloomin’ ship’s propeller—
If they ’aven’t stopped the vessel through the
weather, or the whim
Of the admiral or skipper—an’-it plays the deuce
with him.
Wot’s the odds? He can’t come back. It only
means a dead bluejacket
(Which for that same matter, messmate, might be
either you or me)
Gets a double kind o’ doin’ as they puts ’im down
at sea.
When I leaves the China station with me
“compo ”+ in me ’and;
Goes I down ’er side at Portsmouth for a good
spell-ho on laud.
Then I thinks o’ poor ole Parker, an’ I starts to
feelin’ blue,
For I said I’d see the missus, an’ I’ve got to get it
through.
“Wot a pretty pickle this is,
Ere I’m bound for Parker’s missis,
An’ the news I’ve got to fetch ’er won’t be wel-
come, ’less I lie.
An’ she’ll want the truth or nuthink,” to me
bloomin’ self sez I.
Now, I ’ate to start a-lyin’
’Bout a decent messmate’s dyin’, ,
But ’is dyin’ came so ugly, ’cause it started in a
row—
“ Damn,” sez I, “I’ll say it didn’t, and I’ll chance
it anyhow!”
No, she didn’t start to faintin’, and she didn’t
weep nor wail,
For they’d told ’er all about it, an’ ’er grief was
tired and stale;
But I see ole Parker’s kiddie an’ I chucked it ’arf-
a-crown,
An’ I sez, “ You’ll soon be married,” ’fore I took
the ’bus to town ;
But she sez before I’m leavin’-
“ Ned,” sez she, “ I ain’t a-grievin’;
’E was always kind an’ gentle to the young ’un
an’ to me,
But I feel it orful sometimes that ’e’s layin’ out
at sea,
An’ it do seem ’ard an’ funny
That they asked me for the money
For the ’ammock that they sewed my poor dead
’usbaud’s body in ! ”
“’Ard?” sez I, “Gawd strike me silly, it was
nuthink but a SIN ! ”
Now, them there newspaper jokers they would
’ardly credit that,
But for every such the Navy charges seving-an’-
a-sprat ;§
So I tells ’er “Never mind, mum,” an’ I gives
another quid
In a bit ’o Parker’s tunic (an’ me blessin’!) to the
kid,
An’ I left ’em as I found ’em
With their bits o’ sticks around ’em,
With the flower-pot in the windy and ’is chest
agen the wall,
An’ that gallant little woman bearin’ bravely
through it all.
Gawd rest ’is bleedin’ bones,
’E ’as gone to Davy Jones,
But I’m goin’ back to Chatham when I gets re-
lieved from ’ere,
An’ I'll ask ’er No ; she wouldn’t ’ave
me. . . Take another beer!

THE GOOD SLEEP OF A BAD MAN.
In a certain prison that we all have heard of laj
a convict upon his narrow iron cot. He was to be
hanged the next morning. Yet he lay therq
covered by a rough blanket, sleeping as quietlj
and soundly as a tired schoolboy. Occasional!}
the guard in the passage outside peered between
the bars of the cell, only to find his charge breath-
ing deeply and regularly. This man had violated
the law prohibiting murder ; yet he had not vio-
lated the physical laws governing his own body,
and nature rewarded him as if he had been the
noblest of his race.
That same night, loss than a mile away, a rich
man tossed and tumbled upon his luxurious bed.
He was a good and useful member of society, yet
he could not sleep. And, worse still, this hap-
pened to him every night. Sleep—that blessing
which the Psalmist says, “God giveth his
beloved,” was practically a stranger to this man.
What ailed him ? The tortures of conscience ?
Want of money ? The fear of enemies ? Nothing
of the sort. Then why didn’t he sleep as well as
the murderer ? You would like to know ? Eight,
let us look into the matter.
“I got no sleep at night; I would lie for hours
tossing about. In the morning I was worse tired
than when I went to bed.”
Thus writes Mrs. Eliza Mathews, of 1, North
Road, Burnt Oak, Edgware, near London, under
date of September 22nd, 18 ( J2. Just two years
before this time she lost her health. A foul taste
in the mouth, loss of appetite, and great distress
after eating were among the first tilings she com-
plained of. She craved food at times, and fancied
she could eat heartily, yet when the very dishes
she had asked for were set before her she turned
from them as though they were filth from the
gutter. Her skin grew sallow, her eyes yellow,
and she had a constant pain at her chest, sides,
and between her shoulders. Her bowels were
constipated, and the least exertion set her heart
thumping as if it must jump up into her mouth.
At such times it was as much as ever that she
could get her breath. She got so thin and weak
she was no good for work. She couldn’t walk out
doors without stopping to rest every few rods
almost.
The doctor did what he could for her, all any
doctor could do. At first he said he thought her
illness was owing to the smell of the farm-yard.
This looked possible. Even the smell of violets
has made strong men turn pale and faint dead
away. Yet the doctor was wrong. If he had
been right, she would have got better when the
family left the farm at Bently Priory and went to
live at Burnt Oak. But she was not improved by
the change of air ; she grew worse and worse.
“In May, 1887,” says Mrs. Mathews, “I went
over to Chlemsford to visit my aunt, Mrs.
Troughton. She told me of the good Mother
Seigel’s Curative Syrup had done her when she
had indigestion and dyspepsia. She bought me a
bottle, and I began taking it. After a few doses I
felt relief. I kept on taking it, and in two months
I was strong and well as ever. My husband and
friends were astonished, yet I assured them that
Seigel’s Syrup had done it. Yours truly, (Signed)
Eliza Mathews.”
The point is plain enough. The convict slept
soundly because he was a healthy man, although
he was a wicked one. Our rich friend rolled about
all night because his nerves were unstrung by the
state of his stomach. Our correspondent was
prostrated by the same thing—indigestion and
dyspepsia. The remedy named cured her because
it has that power. The reason remains a secret
with the roots and herbs from which it is made.
Yet so long as it drives away disease and gives us
back our health and strength, who cares for its
mystery? Results, not arguments, are what we
all want.
“Burnt Oak House, Edgware, September, 22nd,
1892. I have known Mrs. Mathews for some
seven years, and remember her long and lingering
illness. She informs me that Mother Seigel’s
Curative Syrup cured her, after medical and other
means failed. Mrs. Mathews is a lady of respecta-
bility, and her word can be implicitly relied upon.
You can use this statement in any way you may
think proper. Yours truly, (Signed) T. H. House,
Grocer and General Provision Dealer, Burnt Oak
Stores, Edgware.”

The Night the Baby Died.
[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
She was a “quite romantic ” wife,
Awakened from a dreaming brief
To find Realities of Life
In oblong bills for bread and beef,
And household antidotes to grief.
And He was neither bad nor good :
A silent man, who never sighed,
But earned reward for work in food—
A spouse of dull, ungracious mood,
Until the night the baby died.
The wooer, whom the happy girl
Had hoped to bind in silken chains,
Revealed himself a sober churl,
Boasting the wisdom which disdains
To tune its mind to poets’ strains.
The sympathy her spirit sought
His sordid common-sense denied ;
She was his wife, a chattel bought,
Dear only at the price, he though %
Until the night the baby died.
He gave no sign, when baby came,
Of wanting such a care to tend.
Anon the youngster lisped his name,
And bothered him with toys to mend—
Treating his father as a friend.
And Lizzie, sitting down to share
The meal her weary lord supplied,
Rejoiced to see him shift his chair
And stoop to stroke her darling’s hair
The night the little fellow died.
Within an hour the shadow fell.
Fate dealt an unexpected blow :
The boy, who seemed so bright and well,
Had fled his playground here below
Ere yet she dared prepare for woe.
Only a form forsaken lay,
Its sightless eyes still opened wide ;
Poor Lizzie clasped the hands of clay,
She felt their blood-warmth steal away—
O God ! the night the baby died.
And he, the father, hung his head,
Rememb’nng how, in days of old,
His wife—-now kneeling by the bed,
Fondling those tiny fingers cold—
Had offered him her heart of gold.
He gazed through magic crystal tears
And saw again his smiling bride,
Whilst borne across the waste of years,
A conscience whisper smote his cars—
Aye ! on the night the baby died.
She felt a kiss upon her cheek,
She saw the love-light flush his face ;
His broken voice, how soft and weak,
When, like a sinner seeking grace,
He pleaded for the lost one’s place I
She put the waxen hands at rest,
Then dx-ew her husband to her side,
Laying his head against her breast,
And Love was born of sorrow blest,
E’en on the night the baby died.

Truganina.
[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
How many people know that Truganina, the last
of the Tasmanian natives, lived some years in
Victoria, was charged with murder and tried for
her life at the Supreme Court, Port Pnillip, on
the 20th Dec., 1841 ? Were the particulars ever
published since in Australia, or anywhere else?
When G. A. Robinson came from Tasmania to
Port Phillip, in 1838, he brought over a lot of
Tasmanian natives, including one called “ Lalla
Rookh Truganina,” a native of Bruni Island.
Robinson was the man who succeeded by kind-
ness in doing, single-handed, for nothing, what
4000 armed men failed to do at a cost of <£70,000.
At Por Phillip he was appointed first protector of
Australian aborigines, at a salary of J 2500.
The attempt to settle the Tasmanians at Port
Phillip was not a success. Among other serious
troubles wa< the following dismal tragedy. On
6th Oct., ’4l, five of the Tasmanians, two men
and three w omen, were camped at Cape Patter-
son, close to the beach. The two men had rifles
and pistols. One of the women was Truganina.
The two m n shot two whalers named Cook
and ‘ ‘ Yankee ” —one through the head and the other
through the body. On the 17th all five Tasmanians
were arre ted by Commissioner E. A. Powlett,
with five Border police, and Lieut. Rawson, with
eight soldiers of the 28th Regt. Truganina showed
Powlett the graves where the two whalers were
buried. She and the other two women—“ Maria ”
and “ Fanny ” —were present when the men were
shot. It appears that the two whalers were mis-
taken for a miner named Watson and his mate.
The grievance was—the old, old story !
On 2iJth Dec., ’4l, Judge John Walpole Willis
sat on the Supreme Court bench at Port Phillip,
and before him in the dock we e two men and
three women, from the last of the Tasmanians.
Their names in the indictment were Robert
Jemmy Tummy Smallboy, Jack Napoleon Tun-
ninerpara way, Lalla Rookh Truganina, Fanny
Waterpooideyer, and Maria Matilda Nattepole-
nimma.
They were defended by Mr. Barry, who made
an eloquent and pathetic speech in their defence.
The p isoners had all admitted the shooting of the
two whalers. They told one tale, and never
varied in the smallest particular.
G. A. Robinson, in his evidence, said that “ the
prisoners came with me from Flinders Inland in
1838. The prisoner Robert undertook a jou ney
to Adelaide with Mr, Alfred Longhorn, and his
services were considered of the highest order and
his character excellent. He has been in my ser-
vice for 13 years, and was quite a lad when I
obtained him. His conduct was always good and
honest. He was a native of Capa Portland. Jack
came from Cape Grim, at the N. W. extremity of
Van Diemen’s Land. His conduct has always
been most satisfactory. Truganina is a native of
Bruni Island, and has been with me on all my
journeys. She is the wife of Woradi. She saved
my life at Arthur’s River in V.D. Laud. She
swam over and took mo across. The other two
women were emancipated from the sealers in
Bass’s Straits. The women are not allowed by
the men to act according to their own will. They
are in absolute subjection.”
Judge Willis, in his able and very impartial
address, referred to two Queensland aboriginals
named Moridio and Noogarail, then recently
hanged at Sydney for the murder of surveyor
Stapylton and his assistant, Tuck, at the head of
the Logan River on 30th May, 1840.
The jury, after half-an-hour, found the two
men guilty, with a recommendation to mercy on
account of good character. Truganina, Maria, and
Fanny were acquitted. On the following morning
Judge Willis sentenced the two to death. Their
case was referred, on 3rd Jan., 1842, to the
Executive Council at Sydney—Gov. Gipps, Sir
Maurice O’Connell, the 001. Secretary and the
Tj easurer.
This tribunal ignored the jury’s recommendation
and confirmed the sentence. The two unfortunate
Tasmanians were hanged accordingly, both facing
death with the cool stoicism of the savage.
Their last thoughts will remain conjectural
through all eternity. According to their laws
they were fully justified in killing the two
whalers, believing them guilty of an outrage on
their women. Truganina (pronounced Trooga-
neena) returned and died in her native land.
Her skull is now on view at Hobart Museum.

Asking the Old Man’s Consent.
[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
“ You must ask father first, before I agree alto-
gether.’’
“Now, Molly, haven’t you just agreed? And
now you Want to put another proviso in.”
“ But you will have to ask dad, anyway.”
This was after Molly Mahony had agreed to
sink into oblivion and be known as Mrs. Bibbs
three months from date of agreement.
“ But I don’t know how to address the old
buffer.”
“ Don’t call my dad an old buffer, or .”
“ There, now, Molly, don’t get riled ; I’m very,
very sorry.”
“ All right, run away and write at once. Now,
behave yourself, sir!”
Header, have you ever attempted to write to an
old gentleman you never saw, to ask him to allow
you to adopt his daughter ? It seems easy, but
get pen, ink, and paper, and set yourself down
with the exhilarating effect of the last kiss still
upon you ; with all your ideas mortgaged by a
little bundle with blue eyes, and brown curls on
top ; and see how you get on.
After a dozen attempts, and as many sheets of
waste paper, I hear a light footstep slipping
up behind. I pretend to be very busy, and a
pair of soft hands come together over my eyes.
“ Molly, how could you! Look at the big blot
you made!”
“Oh!” (satirically) “what a long letter you
have written to dad! ”
“ Can’t manage it, Molly.”
“You stupid old dear, it’s easy to write to
daddy ; you have only got to tell him that ”
A pause, and a shy, downcast glance.
“Well, just tell me what to say, and I’ll write
It down I ”
“ The idea of my asking for myself J ”
“ Well, you write and ask my dad for me, and
I’ll copy your letter.”
“ Your daddy doesn’t require any asking, and I.
wouldn’t do it if he did. . , . There now 1
Don’t be cross, you old goose I ” \
Sh-cluck J
“ Don’t do it so loud, somebody will hear you I ”
Sh-cluck I
“ Be quiet, I didn’t mean you to do it again.”
“ I wish we were savages, Molly,”
“You horrid wretch 1 Why ? ”
“ Then I would only have to take you.”
“ But some other big savage might want me.”
“But I’d get you if he was ten feet high,
and savage from the ankles up.”.
“ Would you really? ” with a glance of admira-
tion. [I stand sft. 4in. in my boots.]
“Yes, Molly; who wouldn’t for such a beauti-
ful darling ?”
Sh-cluck! -■■■■.
“ I’ll get my letter-writer, Micky.”
“The very thing I”
We have an hour’s interesting search. Molly
insists on reading the love-letters-—as if any fellow
couldn’t write a love-letter without a model to go
by ! We hunt ; but not one can we find to fit our
case. Everybody that wants a father-in-law seems
to be in a different position from me. I begin to
wish that Molly had no father. Then I wade
through a lot of proposals. I don’t know what
use they are. As if a fellow is likely to let a girl
go away, then bother himself for a week trying to
put enough English together to tell her he wants
her to come back and marry him! At last I see a
business letter that seems to fit my case. Some
fellow wants to buy a partnership.
After three hours’ study I got the following
together. As Molly carried it herself, and ex-
plained matters when she got home, it was suc-
cessful ; so I give it to the world at, large, and
expect the gratitude of all young fellows situated
as I was:— ■ ;

Aii Impossible Motion
V
SERGT- WILLIAM SULLIVAN
Sergeant William Sullivan is up to
something—he is up to the wall, upright
to the wall, right up to the upright wall.
It is a queer position for a real live ser-
geant ; it looks a painful one, but he does
not show his face—that would tell a tale.
He is laughing, although he is straining
every nerve to keep his equilibrium. It v
is not because Sergeant. Sullivan is a
giddy man that he makes this attempt to
lean sideways straight up to the wall.
Neither does he try it because there
is no convenient lamp - post to em-
brace. The fact is, he was offered
Five Pounds if he could do it, and, as
the picture shows, he attained the
desired position, but he didn’t attain the
desired Prize, for we were inquisi-
tive, and found out the Old Soldier
dodge. He had a nail on his finger—
an iron one—and driven into the wall.
That wasn’t in the piece, so Sergeant
Sullivan retired, and he says, “You
can’t pull the breeches off a High-
lander, and you can’t do that—it’s an
impossible motion.” Now, readers, the
proprietor of Beecham’s Pills invites you
and all your friends to place your right
side right up to an upright wall, every
portion of your side from ankle to the
shoulder being in contact with the wall.
Then attempt to raise the left foot from
the ground while the right side of the
body is still in contact with the wall. If
there is no fun to be got out of this
experiment, you are in a bad way, and
we feel it our bounden duty to remind
you that for ensuring buoyant spirits,
and the capacity to enjoy life to the
full, BEECIIAM’S BILLS are
Worth a Guinea a Box!
