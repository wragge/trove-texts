My Heart.
[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
I loved a little maiden- •
Alas ! she loved not me :
And my heart with grief so laden
Straight broke in pieces three.
One piece I gave to the children,
Who tossed it about with glee—
A heart is a pretty plaything
When red with misery.
One piece 1 gave to my lost love
To wear when I was dead—
It hangs on her frozen bosom
Liice a piece of ruddied lead.
One piece I gave to the people—
It oft had bled for their woe—
But they dried it for exhibition
In a magic-lantern show.
FRED J. BROOMFIELD.
Two Books by Stephen Crane .
George s Mother ” and “ Maggie ” are worthy
of the author of “The Red Badge of Courage.”
His method is unchanged : his results are just as
remarkable. His intuition, power of obser-
vation, and faculty of expression, taken to-
gether, amount to genius. Yet, asking one’s self
whether his books will be permanent, whether
they stand on the same plane as fic-
tional standards like “Vanity Fair” or “Les
Miserables,” the answer is curiously uncertain.
W ork so brilliant should be lasting. Yet it leaves
on the mind, after all, the impression of a momen-
tary tourde force.
Perhaps at present Crane suffers somewhat
because he is so entirely novel : nobody knows ex-
actly where to place him. He makes his stories
m a way in which no one ever made stories before,
lolstoi may have given him hints, but they are
improved almost out of knowledge. There is a
Dickensy fiction and a Thackerayan fiction, and a
fiction of the Howells kind, and the New Woman
kind, and half-a-dozen other kinds, and the nor-
mal worker in any of these kinds of fiction has
innumerable standards of comparison awaiting
him. But Crane has the good fortune to be ab-
normal. Many people praise his work ; many are
indifferent to it; some blame it ; but there is no
doubt that of its kind, and to his extent, it is
unique. He has created a mode.
His chief weakness is that he has not yet created
anything else. He displays prodigious imagina-
tive power in dissecting minds and laying bare
emotions. His identification of himself with his
characters is so complete that one cannot but
believe that his characters thought and felt in the
exact fashion ascribed to them. But he stops at
analysis. He sees and observes men' and women
doing this and that, and he takes the reader
behind the clock-face and shows the wheels and
springs, the checks and impulses, which account
for the movement. His skill in language makes
him an unsurpassable showman, and yet his men
and women impress one rather as men and «omen
in a cinematographe than as living human beings.
Despite the wonder of them there is an ever-
present sense of artful mechanism. And nobody
wants cinematographe all the time.
Stephen Crane, in truth, lowers his imagination
to the level of his facts : the greatest writers of
fiction have always raised their facts to the level
of their imagination. The essential characteristic
of a work of art, whether in fiction or elsewhere, is
that it should be no isolated presentment of de-
tached things or persons, but should have
a visible relation to all things and persons,
be in contact with every facet of existence.
Every great book is more or less a new edition of
the Book of Life —maybe in octavo, or mavbe
only in duodecimo; perhaps with many chapters
missing, perhaps ill-bound, or ill-printed, or
written in a foreign language of which only now
and again a sentence is intelligible; but withal
unmistakeable in its scope and purport. Crane’s
work is only a fragment of a page —what one
man can see and describe for himself. It is ad-
mirable so far as it goes, but it lacks artistic
breadth and unity.
♦-
“ George’s Mother ” is a poor, narrow, religious
old woman drifted to New York with her son, a
workman. She has memories of a country life, of
a husband, other children —all gone : George is
all she has to live for. As the story opens George
is coming home from work. Passing a street
corner a man recognises him—an old country
friend he hasn’t seen for years. They go into a
saloon for a drink, after the asinine habit of men.
Jones, the friend, isiolder.
There was something very worldly and wise about him.
Life did not seem to confuse him. Evidently he under-
stood its complications. His hand thrust into his
trousers-pocket, where he jingled keys, and his hat
perched back on his head, expressed a young man of vast
knowledge. His extensive acquaintance with bar-tenders
aided him materially in his habitual expression of wisdom.
George reaches home late, and his mother is
anxious. He resents her anxiety :it assails his
manly dignity. And she always worries him by
telling him to hang his coat up behind the door.
Nevertheless, she asks him to go to prayer-
meeting with her. He is fond of her, and fences
for an excuse.
‘ But— 'he said attain. He was obliged to make great
search for an argument. Finally he concluded: ‘But
what th’ blazes would I do at prayer-meetin’?
In liis ears was the sound of a. hymn, made by people
who tilted their heads at a prescribed angle of devotion.
It would be too apparent that they were all better than
he. When he entered they would turn their heads and
regard him with suspicion. This would be an enormous
aggravation, since he was certain that he was as good as
they.
‘Well, now, y’ see,’ he said, quite gently. ‘I don't
wanta go, an’ it wouldn’t do me no good t’ go if I didn’t
wanta go.’
His mother’s face swiftly changed. She breathed a
huge sigh, the counterpart of ones he had heard upon
like occasions. She put a tiny black bonnet on her head,
and wrapped her figure in an old shawl. She cast a
martyr-like glance upon her son, and went mournfully
away. She resembled a limited funeral procession.
The young man writhed under it to an extent. He
kicked moodily at a table-leg. When the sound of her
footfalls died away he felt distinctly relieved.
Gradually the need of excitement, the pleasure
of conviviality, and the disgust born of being told
every evening to hang his coat on the hook, lead
George into drinking habits. There is a picture
of the knot of cronies in the saloon on his first
evening out. They were all so happy and friendly
and proud of their company. In their little back
room they felt themselves on a sort of island
away from the world of coarse humanity.
Each man explained in his way that he was totally out
of place in the beforementioned world. They were
possessed of various virtues, which were unappreciated
by those with whom they were commonly obliged to
mingle—they were fitted for a tree-shaded land where
everything was peace.
Now that five of them had congregated, it gave them
happiness to speak their inmost thoughts without fear of
being misunderstood.
As he drank more beer George felhis breast expand
with manly feeling. He knew thatf'he was capable of
sublime things. He looked upon the beaming faces and
knew that if at that instant there should come a time for
a great sacrifice he would blissfully make it. He would
pass tranquilly into the unknown, or into bankruptcy,
amid the ejaculations of his companions upon his many
virtues.
Then George nourishes amatory sentiments
which, suddenly nipped, help along the rake’s
progress.
An indefinite woman was in all of George’s dreams. . .
He was icy, self-possessed ; but she, the dream-girl, was
consumed by wild, torrential passion. He went to the
length of having her display it before the people. He
saw them wonder at his tranquillity. It amazed them
infinitely to see him remain cold before the glory of this
peerless woman’s love. . . .
One day he met Maggie Johnson on the stairs. She
had a can of beer in one hand and a brown-paper parcel
under her arm. She glanced at him. . . . He was silent
for the most part at supper that night. He was particu-
larly unkind when he did speak. His mother, observing
him apprehensively, tried in vain to picture the new ter-
rible catastrophe. She eventually concluded that he did
not like the beef jitew. She put more salt in it. . . .
He met a young man in the halls one evening who said
to him: ‘ Say, me frien’, where d’ d’ Johnson birds live
in, hey ? ’
‘Two flights up,’said George, stonily. He had felt a
sudden quiver of his heart. The grandeur of the clothes,
the fine worldly air, the experience, the self-reliance, the
courage that shone in the countenance of this other
young man, made him suddenly sink to the depths of
woe. ...
They were going out to a show, perhaps. That pig of
the world in his embroidered cloak was going to dazzle
her with splendour. He mused upon how unrighteous it
was for other men to dazzle women with splendour.
Then he goes home, and ... his mother tells
him to hang up his coat on the nail. George
explodes !
During the next few days he suffered from his first
gloomy oonviction that the earth was not grateful to him
for his presence upon it. . . . He could perceive that
the universe hated him. He sank to the most sublime
depths of despair.
Then Jones.invites him to “ol’ Bleeoker’s blow-
out t’-morrah night. Anything yeh want t’
drink.” George accepts with fervour. y
As he walked home he thought that he was a very
grim figure. He was about to taste the delioious revenge
of a partial self-destruction. The universe would regret its
position when it saw him drunir.
George gets very drunk, and doesn’t go home till
morning. He tells his mother he was knocked
over by a truck : his remorse is so great that he
even goes to prayer-meeting with her. But the
descent goes on. He loses his situation. His
friends look askance at him. His mother is heart-
broken. She takes to her bed; and the closing
scene might have been imitated from the dexterous
close of “Madame Bovary ”
Over the transom from.the hall-way came two voices.
•Johnnie!’
‘Wot! ’
‘ You come right here t’ me! I want yehs t’ go fd’
store fer me! ’ *
‘ Ah, ma, send Sally 1 ’
‘No, I will not! You come right here! ’
‘ All right, in a minnet ! ’
‘ Johnnie 1’
‘ In a minnet, I tell yeh 1 ’
‘Johnnie ’ There was the sound of a heavy tread,
and later a boy squealed. Suddenly the clergyman
started to his feet. He rushed forward and peered. The
little old woman was dead.
“Maggie”—she is apparently the Maggie of
George’s dream—is hardly so good : less compact
and more conventional. It is the story of a slum-
girl a little more finely fibred than the others. A
chapter of prologue shows herself and her brother
Jimmie as children in an environment of squalid
horror. Tliere is a baby, and a drunken virago of
a mother, and an ordinary, decent-enough father.
The infant dies; the father disappears; Jimmie
grows up rather more honest than could have beeta
expected.
He clad his soul in armour by means of happening
hilariously in at a mission church where.a man composed,
his sermons of “ yous.’' Once a philosopher aslted this
mm why hedid not say “we” instead of “you.” The
man replied, “ What?”
While they got warm at the stove he told his hearers
just where he calculated they stood with the Lord. Many
of the sinners were impatient over the pictured depths of
their degradation. They were waiting for soup-tickets.
A reader of the words of wind demons might nave been
able to see the portions of a dialogue pass to and fro be-
tween the exhorter and his hearers.
“You are damned,” said the preacher. And the reader
of sounds might have seen the replv go forth from the
ragged people : “ Where’s our soup ?""
Jimmie and a companion sat in a rear seat and com-
mented on the things that didn’t concern them, with all
the freedom of English tourists. When they grew thirsty
and went out, their minds confused the speaker with
Christ.
When Jimmie was older, he became a truck-
driver. He began to be arrested when he was a
little boy. Before he reached a great age, he had
a fair record.
Two women in different parts of the city, and entirely
unknown to each other, caused him considerable annoy-
ance by breaking forth, simultaneously, at fateful inter-
vals, into wailings about marriage and support and
infants.
Nevertheless, he had, on a certain star-lit evening, said
wonderingly and quite reverently, “Deh moon looks
like h—l, don’t it?”
Maggie, poor Maggie ! was pretty. And to her
came Pete, a big, loud-mouthed, coarse Bowery
bar-tender. Hugo and Hardy, on opposite sides
of the Channel, stop in similar circumstances to
wonder why it is so-why so much feminine frag-
rance should be perpetually gathered up to be
perpetually scattered to the winds. The problem
has a fine sentimental fascination for the male
mind. Poor Maggie ! She was sick of the sewing-
factory “ where sat twenty girls in various shades
of yellow discontent.” And Pete “waved his
hands like a man of the world who dismisses re-
ligion and philosophy, and says ‘ Rats !’ ” Like
Othello, he recounted his exploits ; and, like Des-
demona, Maggie was charmed. She perceived that
here was the ideal man.
Pete took her to Bowery concerts, where quiet
Germans sat listening to the music with the ex-
pressions of happy cows. And one night
Maggie’s mother, in a drunken rage, drove her
from home. “ Git th’ devil outa here.” Maggie
went. A gnarled and leathery woman who lived
at the foot of the stairs waylaid Jimmie next
night.
“Ah, Jimmie, what do yehs think I tumbled to, las’
night! It was deh funnies’ t’ing I ever saw,” she cried,
coming close to him and leering. She was trembling
with eagerness to tell her tale. “ I was by me door las°
night when yer sister and her jude feller came in late,
oh, very late. An’ she, the dear, she was a-cryin’ as if
her heart would break, she was. It was deh funnies’
t’ing I ever saw. An’ right out here by me door she
asked him did he love her, did he. An’ she was a crying
as if her heart would break, poor t’ing. An’ him, I could
see be deh way what he said it dat she had been askin’
orfben, he says, ‘Oh, gee, yes,’ he says, says he, ‘Oh,
gee, yes.’ ”
Jimmie tries to formulate a theory that he had
always unconsciously held, that all sisters, ex-
cepting his own, could, advisedly, be ruined. He
thought he had a great idea of women’s frailty,
but he could not understand why any of his
kin should be victims. “ Curse her !” he said
fervidly. And her mother curses her more
vehemently still. Nevertheless, with a dim idea
of vengeance, Jimmie attacks Pete in the bar.
Once or twice again Maggie is seen with Pete in
concert-rooms.
Maggie was pale. From her eyes had been plucked all
look of self-reliance. She leaned with a dependent air
toward her companion. She was timid, as if fearing his
anger or displeasure. She seemed to beseech tenderness
of him.
Pete’s air of distinguished valor had grown upon him
until it threatened to reach stupendous dimensions. He
was infinitely gracious to the girl. It was apparent to her
that his condescension was a marvel.
He could appear to strut even while sitting still, and he
showed that he was a lion of lordly characteristics by the
air with which he spat.
Poor Maggie! The end hurries. Pete returns
to an older flame; despairing Maggie goes home,
and is driven forth by virtuous mother and brother
with words of contempt and loathing. Then, for
a little while, the street. Then the river. Then
the mother wailing : “ I kin remember when her
two feet was no bigger dan yer thumb, and she
wearad worsted boots.”
“Yeh’ll forgive her, Mary?” pleaded the woman in
black. . . . The mother’s voice came and arose in a
scream of pain. “ Oh, yes, I’ll forgive her! I’ll forgive
her 1"
No decent Scotchman should miss Cun-
ninghatne Graham’s article on Salvagia (to wit,
Scotia) in Sat. Review of Sept. 12. Of a village
in the said Salvagia he notes “At the street
corner groups of men standing spitting. . . .
Women and children are afraid to pass them. Not
quite civilised, not quite savage, a set of demi-
brutes exclaiming, if s’woman in a decent gown
goes past, ‘ There goes a butch.’”

THE PRAYER OF WOMEN".
O Spirit, that broods up m the hills
And moves upon the face of the deep,
And is heard in the wind,
Save us from the desire of men’s eyes,
And the cruel lust of them,
And the springing of the cruel seed
In that narrow house which is as the grave
For darkness and loneliness.
That women carry with them with shame, and
weariness, and long pain,
Only for the laughter of man’s heart,
And the joy that triumphs then-in,
And the sport that is in his hearC,
Wherewith lie inocketh us,
Wherewith he playeth with us,
Wherewith he trampleth upon us . « ,
Us, who conceive and bear him ;
Us, who bring him forth ;
Who feed him in the womb, and at the breast, and
at the knee :
Whom he ealleth mother and wife,
And mother again of his children and his children’*
children.
Ah, hour of the hours,
When he looks at our hair and sees it is grey;
And at our eyes and sees they are dim ;
And at our lips straightened out with long pain;
And at our breasts, fallen and seared as a barren
hill;
And at our hands, worn with toil !
Ah, hour of the hours,
When, seeing, he seeth all the bitter ruin and
wreck of us—
All save the violated womb that curses him
All save the heart that forbeareth . . . for pity—
All save the living brain that condemneth him—■
All save the spirit that shall not mate with him,
All save the soul be shall never see
Till he be one with it, and equal;
He who hath the bridle, but findeth not ;
He who hath the whip, yet is driven;
He who as a shepherd ealleth upon us,
But is himself a lost sheep, crying among the hills 1
O Spirit, and the Nine Angels who watch us,
And thy Son, and Mary Virgin,
Heal us of the wrong of man :
We, whose breasts are weary with milk,
Gry, cry to thee, O Compassionate.

A SONG OF ETHLENN STUART.
He laid his dear face next to mine,
His eyes aflame burned close to mine,
His heart to mine, his lips to mine,
O he was mine, all mine, all mine.
Drunk with old wine of life I was,
Drunk as the wild-bee in the grass
Singing his honey-mad sweet bass,
Drunk, drunk with wine of love I was!
His lips of life to me were fief,
Before him I was but a leaf
Blown by the wind, a shaken leaf,
Yea, as the sickle reaps the sheaf,
My Grief!
He reaped me as a gathered sheaf!
His to be gathered, his the bliss,
But not a greater bliss than this !
All of the empty world to miss
For wild redemption of his kiss !
My Grief!
For hell was lost, though heaven was brief
Sphered in the universe of thy kiss—
So cries to thee thy fallen leaf,
Thy gathered sheaf,
Lord of my life, my Pride, my Chief,
My Grief!


Medical.
COUGHS, COLDS ON TI IE CHEST, BRON-
CHITIS AND ASTHMA RAPIDLY
CURED BY Hearne’s Bronchitis Cure.
Those who have taken this medicine are amazed
at its wonderful influence. Sufferers from any
form of bronchitis, distressing cough, difficulty of
breathing, hoarseness, pain or soreness in the
chest, experience delightful and immediate relief,
and to those who are subject to colds on the chest;
it is invaluable, as it effects a complete cure. It
is most comforting in allaying tickling and irrita-
tion in the throat,and giving strength to the voice,
and it never allows a cough or asthma to become
chronic. No house should be without it, as, taken
at the beginning, a dose is generally sufficient,
and a complete cure is certa in.
“Mr. W. G. HEARNE.— Dear Sir,—Your medicine has
cured me of bronchitis and asthma, from which I suffered
for upwards of seven years, during which period I was
scarcely ever free from coughs, and frequenily l tie diffi-
culty of breathing was so distressing tlint for nights in
succession I had to sit up. I write you this acknowledg-
ment from a sense of duty, as in my case every other
treatment had failed. For a year piev'ious I ha I been
getting very much worse, and at, the time I ohtai • d yntir
medicine I was confined to hod suffering from a most
violent cough, expectorating titood and matter, and
apparently beyond hope of recovery. The firsi dose of
the medicine gave me welcome relief, and I steadily
improved as I continued the treatment, u oil I lie rune,
as I am now, quite well. —Yours sincerely, H. WALKER,
Balmain, Sydney.”
“ My son, six years old, had bronchitis for 12 months.
The noise in throat and along back of lungs, and the
cough, caused me great anxiety. I tried several treat-
m“ills. Cough mixtures and poultices were used and
plasters were applied to the back and chest without
success.
“ I bought a large-size bottle of Hearne’s Bronchitis
Cure, and after my boy bad taken this medicine for about
10 days he was perfectly cured.—J. PATTERSON,
Solicitor, Tamworth, N.S.W.”
“We, the undersigned, have had occasion to obtain
Hearne’s Bronchitis Cure, and we certify that it is per-
fectly and rapidly successful under circumstances which
undoubtedly prove its distinct healing power.”—Signed

their old lustre. The blood-giving principle of the medi-

„ [TESTIMONIAL.!
Dear Sir., Spring Vale.
I have much pleasure in testifying to the real merits of your “ Bioplastine.” After using all other remedies for a
number of years I unhesitatingly give this the preference. My neuralgia has departed and my nerves made strong.
I have induced several persons to give your tonic a trial, with very gratifying results. One lady, a sufferer from
indigestion, felt quite a new creature after taking one bottle of “ Bioplastine.”

[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
THE MEN WHO COME BEHIND.
There's a class of men (and women) who are always
on their guard—
Cunning, treacherous, suspicious—feeling softly—
grasping hard—
“ Brainy,” yet without the courage to forsake the
beaten track—
Cautiously they feel their way behind a bolder
spirit's back.
If you save a bit of money, and you start a little
store—
Say, an oyster-shop, for instance, where there
wasn’t one before ;
When the shop begins to pay you, and the rent is
off your mind,
You will see another started by a chap that comes
behind.
So it is, and so it might have been, my friend, with
me and you—
When a friend of both and neither interferes
between the two ;
They will fight like fiends, forgetting in their pas-
sion mad and blind,
That the row is mostly started by the folk who
come behind.
They will stick to you like—sin will—while your
money comes and goes,
But they’ll leave you when you haven’t got a shil-
ling in your clothes.
You may get some help above you, but you’ll
nearly always find
That you cannot get assistance from the men who
come behind.
There are many, far too many, n the world of
prose and rhyme,
Always looking for another’s “ footsteps on the
sands of time.”
Journalistic imitators are the meanest of man-
kind ;
And the grandest themes are hackneyed by the
pens that come behind.
If you strike a novel subject, write it up, and do
not fail,
They will rhyme and prose about it till your very
own is stale,
Like they raved about the region that the wattle-
boughs perfume
Till the reader cursed the bushman and the stink
of wattle-bloom.
They will follow in your footsteps while you’re
groping for the light;
But they’ll run to get before you when they see
you’re going right;
And they’ll trip you up and baulk you in their
blind and greedy heat,
Like a stupid pup that hasn't learned to trail
behind your feet.
Take your loads of sin and sorrow on more ener-
getic backs !
Go and strike across the country where there are
not any tracks !
And—we fancy that the subject could be further
treated here,
But we’ll leave it to be nackneyed by the fellows
in the rear.
HENRY LAWSON.
ON THE BEACH.
Q.
Poisonous, bloated, crab-like shapes
Crawl in gangs around these capes—
Stopping here and feeding there,
Listening, crawling everywhere ;
Searching every rotten weed
With a frothing, wild-eyed greed ;
Fighting o’er a lump of scurf
Or a red boil of the earth ;
Thrusting up their writhing claws
To their grinning, fiend-like maws.
And these horrid creatures wet
With a thick, unwholesome sweat
Have most hideous banquets here
On the poor drowned marineer.
Down they hurry eagerly
Cluttering all the way with glee :
They have smelt the tain red air
From that body festering there.
How they twitch their claws and pry
Into each distorted eye ;
How they spit on him with spite
As their nippers pinch and bite ;
How they strip him clean and bare,
Leaving not a morsel there,
Till they’re gorged and all squat near
Fleshless remnants with a leer.
When the billows near them roll
Each will scoop himself a hole
In the mud-banks, and therein
Sleep like an embodied sin.
In the world so crass and blind
Human crabs feed on the.r kind :
Glutted creatures that devour
All that fall within their power;
Skulking each near his own hole.
They smell out each human soul
Tossed up on Life's stony shore,
Weary, friendless, weak and poor.

SATURDAY, NOVEMBER 14, 1896.
The Republican Victory.
Last week’s elections have definitely settled
that—bar sudden death or some equally un-
expected circumstance— M‘Kinley will be
the next President of the United States, and
Bryan, of Nebraska, and the bi-metallic and
Freetrade and more or less Single-tax party
are nowhere. The Bryan crowd went down,
apparently, for two principal reasons. The
country has been trying, under Cleveland’s
presidency, a very slight experiment in
Freetrade, and the result has been seri-
ous disaster, just as it was on previous
occasions when the U.S. wandered tem-
porarily into the paths of Shoddy. The
community wants no more Freetrade till the
results of the recent awful experiment are
forgotten, and as Bryan offered more Free-
trade, while M‘Kinley represented the
strongest and most uncompromising variety
of Protection, the Nebraska politician went
under on this question, as a matter of course.
Further, the Democrats who followed Bryan
represented the silver craze in its most
aggravated form, and were even more
vigorous Bimetallists than Freetraders.
Also, they were a great deal more sincere as
Bimetallists than as Freetraders. In fact, it
is doubtful if there was ever much sincerity
about the Democratic party as a Freetrade
organisation, but as it largely represents
the silver-producing States, and its central
idea is that the Federal Treasury should
buy at a fancy price all the silver offered to
it, and coin it into cartwheel dollars for
which there is no demand, and thereby put
an artificial value on the product of the silver
states, its sincerity as a Bimetallic party
was never in question for a moment. And
the Bryan crowd went down because the
great bulk of the community couldn’t see
why the State should spend its gold to boom
the price of silver any more than to boom
the price of coal or bark or salt water, or
any other product that it didn’t want.
* * * m
The Bryan party consisted partly of the
old democratic element in the Southern
States ; partly of the new Silver crowd, the
Single-Tax party, and various other odds and
ends. The old party lines have been practi-
cally obliterated, and the new order of things
has arrived so suddenly that it is difficult to
accurately follow the situation. But the
bulk of the Bryan following was the Silver-
men—one of the many groups of faddists
who profess to believe that all the woes of
this woeful earth can be cured with their one
little nostrum. There are an enormous
number of such fads, and they are about
equally depressing. The extreme Cold-Tea
faction is of opinion that everything that is,
but which shouldn’t be, is the result of
liquor, and that the abolition of liquor will
put all things right. The extreme Freetrade
and Protection and Single-tax apostles, and
the extremists of every other political creed,
are similarly afflicted. Every political faction
of any importance is sub-divided into two
sections ; the moderate men, who believe
that their idea, if adopted, will help to make
the world better, and the fanatics, who hold
that it will make the world quite well, all by
itself, immediately. The Bimetallists con-
tain a very large proportion of fanatics, who
hold that the unlimited coinage of silver will
make the world quite well immediately, and
Bryan, in the main, represented the
crowd which has the silver idea in its
worst form. So it was preached inces-
santly that, with the unlimited coinage
of silver, interest would go down, rents
would diminish, wages would go up, the
grinding tyranny of monopolists, capitalists,
banks, corporations, landlords, and the like
would cease, or at least greatly diminish, and
a halcyon period would arrive when every-
body would be contented and at peace.
• » m *
What would have happened supposing the
Silver Age really had arrived no one knows
for certain—or rather, no one knows for cer-
tain all that would have happened ; but it
would have been a great and beautiful ex-
periment to watch from a safe distance. The
central idea was that the U.S. Treasury
should buy and coin all the silver offered to
it, sixteen ounces of coined silver to be de-
clared worth an ounce of coined gold.
Therefore, all the superfluous silver in the
world would have been brought along to the
U.S. Treasury and sold to the long-suffering
American nation. If it was paid for in paper
the country would become so hopelessly
flooded with Government paper that it would
be next to worthless, and something must
needs break. If it was paid for in gold the
supply of gold would presently run out, and
in that case also something must needs break.
The silver coin couldn’t, so far as appears
from all past experience, be put into circula-
tion. In 1878 the Bland Act, passed by the
influence of the silver men and with a view
to booming their industry, enacted that the
U.S. Mint should coin from two to four
million silver dollars per month ; and the
Sherman Act, passed in 1890, enacted that
silver to the value of 4jy million dollars was
to be purchased and paid for monthly. In
1893 the scheme broke down. The accumu-
lated stock of silver coin which wouldn’t
circulate amounted to something like
400,000,000 dollars. The public had no
use for this stupendous mass of heavy
money. It wasn’t wanted for local cir-
culation. It couldn’t be used to pay the
country’s foreign debts unless it was given
away by weight at its value in the open
market; in other words, for foreign exchange
purposes it was only worth about half its
nominal value, and as the Government
couldn’t get rid of it on that basis without
losing about £40,000,000 on the deal, and as,
of course, foreign countries wouldn’t take it
on any other basis, there was a deadlock.
The notes or “silver certificates” issued
against it only kept up their value because
the Government accepted them in payment
of taxes ; they were partially useless notes
backed up by partially useless coin, and
when the quantity in circulation swelled to
something like 340,000,000 dollars the situa-
tion began to grow serious and it became
obvious that if the system was pushed too far
something disastrous would happen. No
one knew for certain what would happen,
but the silver policy came to a sudden end.
As a certain amount of silver is always
required for small change, and as the small
change gradually wears out, it is probable
that, if coinage stops where it is, the accu-
mulated stock will all drift into circulation in
the course of 500 years or so, and the silver
certificates will be cashed by instalments,
and there will be no great panic or deprecia-
tion or collapse, and the trouble will cure
itself.
* * * *
The policy of the U.S. Government un-
doubtedly did something, while it lasted, to
keep up the price of silver, and thereby
greatly benefited the silver states. But the
Government only did this by buying silver
at more than its value, and stowing it away
in a cellar because it couldn’t sell it again at
its nominal worth, and, provided the cellar
was sufficiently capacious, a similar artificial
value could be given to coal or crockery or
stuffed emus, by exactly the same course of
action. And, as the Government had no use
for the product thus purchased, there seems
to be no reason why it should boom the value
of silver, any more than that of stuffed emus,
at the expense of the nation. But the price
kept declining all the same, because the
Government purchases were not sufficient to
absorb the superfluous output. If all the
nations of the world agreed to make silver
and gold equally legal tender, and to fix the
respective values ah the same figure, there
seems every probability that they could use
up the silver output, and make the price of
the white metal as steady as that of gold.
But, even after allowing for the quantity used
for other than coinage purposes, and for the
demands of the few countries which still
adhere to a silver standard, and for the small
amount used by gold countries for the coinage
of tokens, the surplus is too vast for any one
country, however rich and populous, to absorb,
as the experiences of the U.S. in the past
have fully demonstrated. Yet, in the face
of the huge accummulation of useless dollars
now on hand, the discredited Bryan party
demanded that the nation should buy all the
silver that offered, and pay for it somehow,
and coin tons and tons more of useless money,
and, in short, that it should keep up the
value of silver at any price, for the benefit of
the Western States which want a market for
their metal. The beginning and end of their
policy was to keep up the price of silver by
making the nation buy it for more than it
was worth, and generally “ dash the conse-
quences.” The only probable result would
be that all the country’s gold would gradually
drift away to pay for the silver which poured
in from abroad, and its credit would be pledged
for all it was worth to pay for more silver,
and when its gold and credit were both used
up it would go broke for want of the only
metal in which it could meet its foreign obli-
gations. Then when it stopped buying, the
artificial value of silver would vanish because
the one reliable market had closed up, and the
accumulated mountain of metal would be
worth in the open market about ss. in the
£ on its cost price. The result should have
been the biggest panic the commercial world
has ever seen, and a general falling of the
bottom out of every American institution.
* * * *
If the Bryan party had proposed to make
the United States a silver-standard country,
or to go in for Bimetallism based on some-
thing like the present relative values of the
two metals, it might have passed for a sane
organisation. As it was the question natur-
ally arises : Why should any country set it-
self, at ruinous expense, to keep up the price
of silver throughout the world more than the
price of any other article ? Also, why should
silver necessarily be forced into use for coin-
age purposes more than half-a-dozen other
comparatively rare metals. Iron, copper,
shells, leather, pewter, salt fish and many
other things have all served as currency and
have dropped out again because they became
so plentiful that they ceased to be a con-
venient measure of value. Silver is drop-
ping out in the same gradual fashion, and
why any violent effort should be made to re-
habilitate it any more than to rehabilitate iron
or salt fish it is difficult to understand. The
beautiful things which bimetallists say will
come to pass when their system is adopted
are more than dubious ; their system
had a very long trial in very many
countries, and no millennium ensued.
There were discrepancies, certainly, in the
application of it; it was not a science in
these old days, nor was it worked on the
alleged principles of mathematical accuracy
which are set forth in the theories of to-day;
still it was bimetallism, and it didn’t regene-
rate the earth in the slightest degree. The
cry of the Bimetallist that poverty is caused
by want of the “ meejum of exchange,” and
that if the “ meejum ” —which is now mainly
gold—is increased in quantity by the issue of
an immense mass of white money, a great
want will be filled, comes off rather badly in
view of the fact that the United States
Government is imploring the people to
absorb 400,000,000 dollars of the substance
which is said to be so badly required to
fill the alleged want, and it still lies idle
and useless in the Treasury cellars, and,
instead of filling a want, it has helped
to bring the country to the verge of disaster.
Also, the gorgeous statement of the Bryan
party that mankind “shall not be crucified
on a cross of gold ” sounds well enough, but
probably crucifixion on a cross of silver
would be equally unpleasant. And so long
as the bloated American capitalist owns the
railroads, the banks, the land, bricks and
mortar, stocks, shares and debentures, the
gas and water and tramway concessions, the
mines, and other visible property, he will
own the “meejum of exchange” also,
whether it be gold, paper, silver, copper,
iron, platinum, or anything else. In the
old, old days, long before the time of Jor-
genson’s republic, when salt fish was the
circulating medium in Iceland, the capitalist
crucified his debtor on a cross of dried cod
with just the same facility ; until State
Socialism arrives the cross will be always
handy, and any kind of material will serve
to construct it with.
* * * *
Whether the U.S. silver party will con-
tinue to exist and will fight future elections,
possibly with greater success, or whether it
will evaporate as the Know-Nothings and
other ephemeral political factions have done,
it is impossible to say. One thing seems
reasonably certain : bitter as is the present
hostility between East and West, the talk of
another attempt at secession is altogether
premature. The Solid South, which forms
one end of the Bryan party, has no silver
interests, and would hardly fight for the
mine-owners of the West, and the Western
men have little in common with the interests
of the cotton States. These two sections
were sufficiently united to vote together
against the Republican party, but their ob-
jection to M‘Kinleyism is almost their only
point of agreement. And the Single-tax
party, which is alleged to have formed a
third incongruous element in the Bryan
following, has very little more in common
with the land-holding aristocrats of
Louisiana than with the mining millionaires
of Nevada. If the Bryan party had come
uppermost it would probably have broken to
pieces through internal dissensions, and the
end of it would have been even more frag-
mentary than the beginning.
A Subject of No Popular Interest.
Bathurst, N.S.W., advertises another confer-
ence about Federation. There is no harm in
that. Presumably people are as fond of talk
in Bathurst as elsewhere, and the time and
place of talk are seasonable. Spring is not yet
over; there have been fertilising rains; and
Bathurst is a salubrious township 2100 feet
above sea-level, where abstract questions are
naturally assailed with energy. And if, in the
course of discussion, the pre-eminent claims of
Bathurst to become the federal capital should
outcrop incidentally w'hat odds ? Again :
there is no harm in that. A while ago the
leaders of opinion in Bournemouth, a south-
coast English health-resort, perceived that the
invalids were not flocking thither as they
should. So they invited the British Medical
Association, many hundreds of doctors strong,
to hold a congress at Bournemouth ! And they
dined those doctors, and they wined ’em, and
made flattering speeches to them, and drove
them about, and gave them a good time gener-
ally. The grateful doctors departed, aim next
month such a stream of moneyed consumptives
and paralytics began to flow into Bournemouth
that the boarding-house accommodation had to
be quadrupled, and the pockets of the leaders
of opinion grew too full to chink. Bourne-
mouth—Bathurst—ah ! those busv B’s
Anyway, the more talk about Federation the
better. It will not convince the average Aus-
tralian that Federation is desirable, for the
average Australian has no definite opinions
about the matter, and is incapable of conviction
one way or the other. But it will help to
accustom him to the idea that Federation is
inevitable. That is all that can be hoped from
the average Australian. He'is like Daniel
Lambert, the celebrated fat man, of whom his
mother said, when he was aged 16 and measured
64 inches round the waist : “ Dan doesn’t like
walking, but he moves quite nicely if you shove
him a little.” The average Australian will
move quite nicely into Federation, if you shove
him a little. He will never walk into it of his
own motion, unless under the influence of some
very extraordinary stimulus. And the average
Australian fills three-fourths, perhaps five-
sixths, of this great country. His nationality
varies, but, in the matter of Federation, he is
all tarred with the same apathetic brush.
“Federation!—what is Federation?” “Oh,
something they talk about in Parliament. Haw
anything on Newhaven for the Cup ? ”
• * * *
Slippery Sam Griffith the other day said
words to the effect that since the ’9l Convention
the no-value of a machine-made Federation had
impressed him. That is, he perceives that a
federal constitution theoretically admirable
may be practically useless or dangerous unless
suited to precedent conditions, giving full play
to existing impulses. That’s so, undoubtedly. A
people is an organism which can’t be grown suc-
cessfully like a dwarf tree in a Chinese flower-
pot —however elegant the flower-pot. You can
tether it to principles just as you can tether a
calf to a sapling, but the longer the tether the
better. And it is certain that, by-and-by, you
will have to shift the tether to a sapling further
on. A constitution must leave room for expan-
sion, change of views and change of conditions.
The U.S. constitution-makers recognised this,
but no man’s wit can look ahead two centuries.
The Yankee nation has outgrown the Yankee
constitution, and very soon the constitution
must begin growing too, or something will
snap. Griffith’s thesis was sound all along •
its soundness is a commonplace.
* * * *
But Griffith did not sufficiently elaborate
his thesis. He sees that our federal constitu-
tion must be loose—a big suit for a growing
boy. But he did not say that the looseness
Federation all the easier ; for it is the
tight suit that needs careful fitting. And, once
Federation is put on, it will not come off. No-
body opposes Federation with any warmth
except certain Parliamentary sections. The
average Australian, grafted on an English
stock, exhibits the characteristic English
indifference to ideals. He is occupied with
cricket, and the cheap loaf, and the land-tax
assessment —things which obviously hit a fellow
where he lives. But he has no objection to
Federation. Once plunged into it, he will
swim all right. The new order of things will
suit his equilibrium as well as the old. But he
must be shoved over the edge ; and we look to
publicists and representative men to administer
the shove. If the question rested with the
Australian press, Federation would have been
a fact long ago. The devotion of the press to
the “ fair ideal ” is as marked as the lukewarm
hostility of politicians. Unfortunately, the
average Australian mostly leaves his politics to
be managed by men with loud mouths and
mean motives, who are always ready to roll
their little logs in the path of national progress.
And—worse luck ! —the question of Federation
rests with the politicians.
PLAIN ENGLISH.
The Ass on “Freedom.”
Maoriland National Ass party appeals to the
electors of the Cold Tea Land with one of those
large, vague, hazy programmes which mean any-
thing or something or nothing, and which don’t
commit the party to one thing more than
another. The programme is a mass of un-
defined bad intentions seen vaguely through a
fog ; it doesn’t contain a straight-out assurance
that the proposed Ass Government will do one
single definite act, but only promises that it
will hover round according to certain principles
not very clearly stated. The party is in favor
of reducing taxation and gradually paying off
the public debt; this is about the only reason-
ably distinct item in its manifesto, and it is
about as distinct as a mirage and not quite so
definite as a Mahatma. Every other party is
in favor of the same things, but as the. debt can’t
be reduced unless more revenue is raised, and
taxation can’t be reduced without increasing


the debt, the Ass party might as well state that
it is in favor of the abolition of sin and believes
in having a full moon every night. It doesn’t
even profess to show how it can reduce debt
and taxation at the same time ; it is only in
favor of these things happening if they
manage to come about. The freehold system
of land tenure is to be “preserved and
encouraged ”; it always has been preserved, so
that is nothing, and how it is to be encouraged
doesn’t appear. The “speedy utilisation” of
Native lands is another item, but whether this
means voluntary oj compulsory purchase, or
lease, or pure steal, is unexplained. The Ass
party also believes in as little as possible
“ State interference with industrial and com-
mercial enterprise.” This might mean that the
Tory crowd wanted to abandon the State enter-
prises already on hand, and sell the State rail-
ways, and shut up the State Land Bank and
State Life Insurance Department, and put the
B.N.Z. again under private management, and
dispose in one lump of the estates acquired
under the Land Settlement policy, and sur-
render the Midland line to the old syndicate.
Or it might mean that the party only
intended going in for no new enterprises.
Or, again, it might mean that the Russell-
Stout crowd was in favor of Freetrade as
against Protection, or it might mean almost
auything. Some further obscurity is shed on
the subject by the announcement that the Tory
organisation is in favor of “ freedom for men,
freedom for industry, and freedom for enter-
prise.” Naturally enough, the question arises
here : What is the Ass’s idea of freedom ? It
may mean liberty for every man to work his
employes 12 hours a day in an insanitary work-
shop, or liberty to start swindling companies,
or to pay sweater’s wages, or to be poisoned by
unspeakable grog, or to charge 250 per shent,
or to have open drains on his premises, or to
sell typhoid germs in his milk, or any other
kind of liberty. There are quite as many bad
varieties of freedom as good ones; the
word sounds large and beautiful, but it
isn’t a thing to be taken on trust.
Whenever freedom is conferred on one indi-
vidual ft means restriction on another. Even
the emancipation of the enslaved nigger wasn’t
all freedom ; the law conferred on the nigger
the privilege of owning himself, and it took
away from the white man the privilege of own-
ing the nigger, and some of him still defines
liberty as the right of the Caucasian to own and
wallop the African as he feels inclined. There-
fore, when the Maoriland Tory party says
vaguely that it is in favor of freedom it is a fair
thing to ask it whether it proposes to free the
sweater, and the land-grabber, and the money-
lender, and the jerry-builder, and the bogus
bank man, and the usurer, and the syndicator,
and the importer of foreign goods made by
pauper labor, and the Chow and Jap and coolie
—or if it means to set free the other fellow.
Until this point is cleared up—and the Tory
party carefully refrains from clearing it up—
Maoriland should keep strictly clear of the
Russell crowd and all its works.

The Poor Old Gentleman.
The plea constantly advanced by the Vic. Fat
Man crowd, and the Argus, and the National
Ass following generally, against any alteration
of the Vic. company law in the direction of
increased stringency, is that it will drive “ men
of the right stamp ” out of the directing busi-
ness. Also, it will lead to the retirement of
“able business men,” and “men of probity
and acumen,” and “men of intelligence and
standing,” and “ men with a stake in the
country,” and other beautiful sorts and varieties
of men too numerous to mention. This course
of reasoning naturally implies that these men
are already in the business ; if they are not in
it they can’t be driven out of it, and the
country can’t lose their valuable services if it
hasn’t got them, and it is impossible for it to be
ruined by their departure if they are not there.
Under these circumstance the line of argument
adopted by Purves, who belongs to the crowd
above-mentioned, in the City of Melbourne
Bank case, is interesting and casts a lot of in-
structive darkness on a matter of some import-
ance. According to Purves, the four directors
on trial, Loader, Williamson, Collier and
Roberts, were mere imbecile tools in the hands
of the Man that’s Dead. “ What chance,” he
asked, “ had these poor old gentlemen with a
combination like that of Fink and Long-
muir ? ” Evidently, on Purves’s line of
argument, they had none at all. They were
four old, weak, foolish, doddering persons full
of senile good intentions, but, in a business
capacity, of no account at all. And, by a
curious coincidence, almost every other com-
pany-director who has been in trouble in Vic-
toria for the last four years has also been clearly
proved, by his lawyer, to be an irresponsible
person, on the verge of idiocy or something, and
utterly incapable of running a company intelli-
gently. This has become so much a matter of
course that it is about time for the Vic. direc-
tor to decide which capacity he will per-
manently assume out of the two that are open
to him. Hitherto, when company reform was
in question, the Vic. director has been an able
and brainy man who mustn’t be scared out of
the business for the sake of any fancied reform,
because his brightness and acumen and mental
grasp make his services absolutely priceless.
And when company dishonesty is under dis-
cussion he generally hires a lawyer to tell the
jury that he is a poor, weak, incapable old
dodderer who dodders so badly that he
can’t be held responsible for anything,
and that no one could possibly take him seri-
ously as a director or as anything else of import-
ance. Obviously, however, he can’t go on in
this dual capacity for ever. If he is the bril-
liant person that he is alleged to be when times
are good, then he must be held fully responsible
for his actions, and it must be assumed that he
knows his business and isn’t built to be the
helpless tool of Longmuir or any other corpse.
And if he is the amiable wreck which he is said
to be when times are bad, then a law is badly
wanted to reform the present kind cf director
out of existence. He can’t be, at one and the
same time, so valuable that the province must
put up with any risk for fear of losing him, and
so weak and useless that he can plead some-
thing that sounds very like incipient insanity
when he is accused of wrongdoing. Which of
the two capacities is he going to stick to ?
And if lie won’t stick to either, will Parliament
take the responsibility of making him per-
manent one way or the other, so that the com-
munity will know how to take him ?
The N.S.W. Land-Tax Muddle.
The great swear of the man whose land-tax
schedule has come to hand still rages through-
out N.S.W. Since last week the reports and
the bad language have had time to arrive from
the backblocks, and it appears that the valua-
tions are about equally astounding in all
parts of the province. A man who has just
sold a bit of land at Longueville (Sydney) for
£5O receives a tax-paper in which it is valued
at <£7oo. Another individual who owns a
stony waste out back, many miles from any-
where, was recently offered by the Government
ss. per acre for two acres to be resumed for
some public purpose. The agriculturist didn’t
object much; in his own discouraged way he
reckoned it was about all the place was worth ;
but now that the local assessor wants to tax
his property on a value of £56 an acre even he
rears up. A Sydney man received two valua-
tions inside a month ; one was a statement from
the Government that it would give him £6O
for an acre of his land which was to be
resumed, and the other was a land-tax
valuation which assessed the same ground at
over <£Boo an acre. A person at North Shore
who is selling his land at from <£6 to <£B per
foot feels annoyed at being taxed on £2l, and a
Rockdale man who is trying to sell a block of
land and a large building for £7OOO uses cuss
words because the land alone is valued at
£10,950. These are a few out of hundreds of
tales that are wailed forth in the daily papers
and elsewhere. The Reid Government is
hustling through a bill to extend the time for
making appeals, it being quite evident that it
will be impossible to deal with a quarter of
them in the period originally allowed. Also, it
promises that liberal reductions will be made,
and there is even talk of a general re-assessment.
And there are other complications. The exten-
sion of the days of grace will carry the collec-
tion of the tax into 1897, and, as even the Reid
Government can’t well start collecting the
second instalment of the tax till the first one is
dealt with, the great idea of getting 18 months’
tax into one financial year begins to look un-
workable. The reductions will necessarily re-
duce the proceeds of the tax considerably. The
re-assessments, and appeals, and the £1 a day
to be paid to assessors for attending appeal
courts, will swell the expense of collection
enormously and further reduce the net proceeds.
The moral stench of the affair will seriously
damage the Ministry, for it is difficult to believe
that there could have been such a wide and
general and unanimous inflation unless the
assessors were instructed to inflate ; at least it
will take a lot of very tough swearing to con-
vince the public that it was all a huge coinci-
dence. Likewise, there are ugly stories about
valuations being increased after they left the
assessor’s hands, and it will take more hard
swearing to dissipate them. Altogether, re-
garded as a muddle, this muddle about breaks
the N.S.YV. record.
The S.A. Drought.
South Australia is apparently on the verge of
a worse drought than even that of last year ; in
fact, it is announced that the crops are utterly
ruined over the largest part of the agricultural
area. The Government already admits that the
case is desperate, and is coming to the rescue.
It proposes making loans on easy terms to those
farmers who have any assets left as security,
and offers to take the most liberal view possible
of the security ; also, it promises to supply seed
to those who have no security to offer; and
private subscriptions are being taken up to
assist in saving those who are in the worst state
of destitution from absolute starvation. South
Australia is none too prosperous at the best of
times ; it is a country with a huge debt, the
smallest gold output in Australasia (and, con-
sidering how often the gold-mining industry has
helped the other provinces through desperately
tight places, this is a serious deficiency), no
silver output, hardly any local coal-supply,
a great deal of desert, about the smallest rain-
fall in Australasia, and a want of almost every-
thing that has helped toshove the other provinces
along. Agriculture has always been about its
strongest point, and now that this industry has
practically gone smash under the influence of
the drought the prospects of the province are
lamentable. The prospects of the Government
are also none too bright. In its last financial
statement, seeing a small surplus ahead, it
followed the usual fatuous Australian policy of
reducing taxation in order to swallow up the
balance before it arrived, and it did this so
effectually that, even on its own figures, there
was a deficiency in front of it. When the
drought has reduced the railway revenue
and the land revenue and' the income-tax
returns, and Parliament has voted a large
sum to relieve the unexpected distress,
the Kingston Ministry will probably realise
that in matters of money, it is, like most
other Australian Ministries, a pretty dismal
failure. Meanwhile the province is struggling
with another serious problem of finance. In
ordinary seasons, S.A. is a large exporter of
grain, and the duties exist mainly as a matter
of form, for there are no grain imports. This
year it is possible that the province won’t sup-
ply its own requirements, and at the best the
surplus will be microscopic. If the supply
doesn’t meet requirements grain must be im-
ported, and the duty, in that case, may possibly
increase the price, and the cheap-loaf party is
already demanding that the tariff in this res-
pect should be suspended for a time. One side
of the question is that if the duty is tempor-
arily removed wheat may be cheaper—and, as a
natural consequence, the agriculturist will get
less for the scanty crop that remains, and
low prices will be added on to deficient quan-
tity to accelerate his ruin. The case for the
suspension, therefore, rests mainly on the doc-
trine of the cheap loaf. The case against the
suspension is that the maintenance of the tariff
may, in this instance, make bread dearer;
therefore, the agriculturist will get better
prices, and instead of having to stand the loss
all by himself, it will be spread over the entire
community, and thus the bucolic inhabitant
may be able to struggle through and keep out
of the Benevolent Asylum until better times
arrive. Also, incidentally, the wheat duty
will bring in a little revenue, and thus help to
keep the Treasury solvent at a time when sol-
vency is a matter of importance. There are
two aspects to the cheap loaf problem at all
times, and in the present case the probabilities
are that the duty wall remain. Just now a
very cheap loaf would probably finish the pro-
cess of ruin and compel South Australia to file
its disconsolate schedule by the Great Austra-
lian Bight.

Queensland’s Defection.
Westralia has passed the Federation Bill, and
five of the provinces are thus brought into line
on the subject of Australian Unity. Queens-
land has decided to be the one dissen-
tient. Its Government, after some more dead-
lock, intimated, the other day, that unless the
Council gave in the Kanaka province would
take no hand in the approaching Convention.
Whereupon the Council threw the mangled car-
case of the Bill back over the fence for the
several-dozenth time, and Queensland definitely
stands out. Under these circumstances Premier
Reid, if he really has any sympathy with
Federation, has no excuse for delaying matters
any longer. Tasmania and South Australia are
understood to be in agreement with Premier
Turner’s idea that a move should be made with
a view to holding the Convention early next
year, but they have hitherto been waiting for
New South Wales, and New South Wales, as
represented by G. H. Reid, decided, wisely
enough, to wait for Westralia and Queensland.
But now that Westralia has come in and
Kanakaleperland isn’t coming at all, there is
nothing more to wait for, and delay only means
letting the subject grow cold, and giving the
public enthusiasm time to die out until it is
even more dead than at present. The present
time and situation are the most favorable that
couldbe imagined for going on with the work. The
absence of Queensland is not only the best thing
that could have happened for the Federation,
but it is also the best thing that could have
happened for the true interests of Queensland
itself. Had all the six provinces been repre-
sented, Tasmania would probably have sent a
majority of Tory delegates, and the Queensland
and Westralian contingents, being appointed by
Tory legislatures, would have been almost
wholly Tory ; and as a consequence the repre-
sentatives from the other three provinces and
any casual Liberals who might be sent by
chance from the stagnant regions would have
made a very small Democratic majority indeed.
A convention, with Queensland and Judas
Griffith included, would be much more likely
to draw up a constitution on fine old bigoted
lines than one without Queensland, where the
three progressive provinces will form a strong
majority. When the Kanaka State comes into
the Federation later on, as it almost certainly
will, it will have to accept a ready-made system
of Government, and as the sort of men whom
the Nelson Government would have appointed
had no hand in its construction it will be all the
better for the white Queenslander of the future.
Despite Nelson’s efforts to make the Northern
delegation a strictly Tory and wholly unrepre-
sentative affair it would have been bad policy
for the other provinces to attempt or even pro-
pose to shut Queensland out, but the fact that
she has decided to shut herself out for the pre-
sent is rather a matter for congratulation than
otherwise, and the other Australias should take
her at her word and go straight ahead.

Loans and Labor.
Editor Bulletin, —The loan-hunger of the
Australias gives sign of breaking out afresh,
and should recall attention to the advantages of
internal over external borrowings—-long pointed
out by The Bulletin. An external loan is a
lasting tax, in goods, on the country that bor-
rows, making the debtor a slave to the creditor
and the market fluctuations in the value of
his produce. On the other hand, an internal
loan may be self - destructive : money bor-
rowed from people who have to pay the
interest on it, is really taking from one
pocket and putting in the other. Let a society
of ten persons borrow from each of its members
£1 ; as a society they would owe £lO ; as indi-
viduals they would be creditors for the amount
of their liability. And the principle is the
same irrespective of amount. The present con-
dition of France, with the largest debt in the
world, compares very favorably with that of
most other countries, even practically debtless
Germany; because the debt is paid by French-
men, who both receive and pay the interest;
and a community, like an individual, however
big its dealings, is solvent while the books
balance. Its only extravagance is waste or idle
labor. Finally, loans are so much goods
advanced by the creditor. Goods stand for
labor, a big loan being a big lending of labor
and the interest is paid in labor. So that the
question resolves itself into this : “Shall we
labor for ourselves or for other people ? ” —H.F.
Attorney-General Isaacs’ constitutional point
in re a flaw in the constitution of the Yic. Land-
lords’ House continues to excite interest in the
South. If there’s anything in the point, it is
to be hoped that the Yic. democrats will refuse
to remedy the trouble at any less price than
the Referendum, and a referendum of a nature
which will practically shelve the Landlords’
House altogether. But, from all appearances,
there is little in the point. In the legal
view, the consolidation carried out by the late
Chief Justice was intended to leave the law
exactly as it was before, and one case decides
that that was so in that particular case. (The
only legal crumb of comfort is contained in a
letter by one of the collaborators in the con-
solidation to the effect that nothing was really
omitted, the obvious inference being that the
Council constitution was “ cronk ” before the
consolidation.) Practically, the flaw means
little for another six years or so, anyway. It
affects elected members only, but, as Council
members are usually unopposed, that doesn’t
signify much. And with regard to the elected
members, the time for appeal has gone by, and,
if it hadn’t, the Elections and Qualifications
Committee would meet and declare the members
fully qualified—which would finish the matter
till next election. But it’s useful to have a
whip of some kind, and doubtful constitutional
points can usually be made very effective whips
by tactful and resourceful Assembly leaders.
There is a fishy odour about a small Mining
Act Amendment Bill which passed almost un-
noticed through YVestralian Parliament during
the last few days of the session. A little before,
a private Bill to empower a certain speculator
to erect poles and convey electric wires over
Crown and certain private lands, in connection
with a large electric-power-transmission scheme,
had been mooted. The Bill provided for a
deposit and the observance of conditions strict
enough, in the opinion of the promoters, to
allow it to run the gauntlet of public and par-
liamentary criticism. It was late in the session,
and in order to get the Bill through the suspen-
sion of the standing orders re private bills
was necessary. As the Attorney-General had
been secured as a shepherd for the Bill, no
trouble was anticipated by the promoters, but
the apple-cart was upset by the Speaker ruling
the motion for the suspension of the standing
orders out of order on the ground that it was
not proper to so relax the safeguards of the
public interest. The Attorney-General in vain
protested against the ruling, but “ got there”
just the same. Immediately he introduced a
short Mining Act Amendment Bill, which
would enable the Govt, to give power to erect
poles and carry wires over holdings, leases, &c.,
under the Mining Act, subject to such con-
ditions and stipulations as the Ministry should
impose and to regulations which might be made
under the Act. The Bill passed both Houses
without its identity with the wrecked measure
being noticed—or, at least, mentioned. The
incident is a fine object-lesson re the methods
of private enterprise in Westralia. The moral
seems to be that if one wants a concession it
is wise to enlist the sympathy of a Minister ol
the Crown, and if one then cannot carry his
little Bill in at the front-door, the Minister
will take it in at the back.
Stumpjumfer to The Bulletin :
Dear Bulletin,—l notice Sydney Daily Telegraph
gushes every Friday morning- over the number of people
“ permanently” settled on the land since the ’95 Act came
into operation. At the first opportunity, when the
“strongman” who takes credit for discovering that the
Almighty didn’t make the whole of N.S.W. worth 20s. an
acre (selectors have been shouting the fact for years) is
engaged in his favorite occupation of booming his hope-
lessly-muddled department, some country member with a
hard, unenthusiastic face ought to rise and enquire if, say,
6 per cent, of the number stated to be already settled in
the Telegraph’s weekly whoop, “ Lands Office Day,” are
actually in legal possession of the holdings applied for.
It does not follow that because two or three thousand
would-be settlers have lodged their cash at the Lands
Office and duly completed their side of the bargain, that
the Lands Minister has performed his. Not by a whole
cask-full. The free-raid Govt, still has its clutches
on a deposit I lodged with an application for land nearly
a year ago. Over seven months passed before the local
Land Board sat, and then I found that my application
was not even set down for a first hearing. As it might be
another seven months before the Board came round again,
and still another seven before the surveyor turned up —
and life is uncertain—I decided to apply for a refund of
my money whilst there was yet time to spend it. lam
still waiting to spend it. After I withdrew, another ap-
plicant lodged a deposit for the same block. My money,
doubtless, helped to swell the last free-raid surplus ; the
other applicant’s deposit, perhaps both, will be kept in
hand to add to another surplus—or reduce a deficit.
Meanwhile, the land for which two deposits have been
paid still remains undealt with. It would be interesting
to learn how much of the Reid surplus will have to be
returned to disgusted applicants. Little things like these
make the unsettled “settler” ask how long it will be
before a “ Select Committee ” or a “ Royal Commission ”
is appointed to enquire into the how-not-to-do-it methods
of that hide-bound collection of sleepy fossils in N.S.W
Lands Department. How long, O Lord ! how long?
Extract from article by Max O’Rell in North
American Review :
I know of one country only where the government by
woman was given a fair trial, and that is New Zealand.
The law was passed and the experiment was made. The
law had to be repealed after six months.
Quite so. But Max missed an excellent oppor-
tunity to describe the struggle which preceded
the said repeal. The last Maoriland Parlia-
ment, elected under adult (male and female)
suffrage, passed an Act empowering the police-
force, composed entirely of Social Purity Society
females, to arrest any male found in the streets
after sunset, take him to the nearest police-
station, and detain him there until 10 a.m. the
next day. Driven frantic by this calculated
assault on its virtue, the male population
flew to arms under the leadership of Capt,
Russell, and after numerous sanguinary battles
stormed Parliament House. Entering the Legis-
lative Chamber, the Captain, pointing to the
cradle in which lay the sleeping infant of the
Speakeress, shouted “Take away that bauble ! ”
All females were then expelled, and an Act
passed by the males present abolishing Female
Suffrage and ordering the pubs, to remain open
all night. Thus ended a memorable epoch in
the history of Maoriland.
The Tory party in Vie. Assembly made a
great effort to rush into the One Adult One
Vote Bill a casual clause largely reducing
the number of members in the Assembly.
The reduction in the membership of the
Legislative Council could be effected, the
MTntyre party blandly remarked, by another
bill later on. Why, cert’nly ! The Council
would cheerfully pass a measure reducing the
membership of the Assembly, partly because
the fewer members the larger the electorates,
and the more expensive the elections, and the
less chance for the candidate without money.
Also, partly because a scheme must be devised
some day to remedy deadlocks, and the simplest
and most probable device in such cases is to let
the two Houses sit as one and decide the dis-
puted point by a majority of the whole Legis-
lature, and then the bigger the Fat Man Cham-
ber is in proportion to the other the better.
The enthusiasm of the Tory party for reducing
the Assembly membership now and reducing the
Council later on when there is more time is a
beautiful sentiment.
This passage from the preface of the 1896
edition of a great English law-book on “ Crimes ”
should bring to the surface any latent blushes in
democratic Australia’s physiology:—-
The power to inflict the punishment of solitary confine-
ment has been repealed by the Statute Law Revision
Acts, that mode of punishment having for some year*
past fallen into disuse.

“Romeo and Juliet,” originally staged at
Sydney Lyceum for three nights, did' so well that
it was afterwards extended to six, and the first
Australian production of Dumas’ “Francillon”
was shifted on from Saturday to Wednesday
(yesterday) night. Whether it will really appear
yesterday night, or whether an intense demand for
more Romeo and an increased supply of Juliet will
again upset the arrangements before this paper
comes out, it is impossible to say at time of writing.
There are a lot of things about the present tragedy
to justify the popular demand. It is beautifully
dressed and staged and there is a great deal of it;
the first night it lasted from 7.45 to 11.20, and the
public has seldom got so much Juliet for its money.
Mrs. Potter is responsible for a lot of this elonga-
tion ; when she gets the stage to herself Juliet
wanders dreamily around with her hair down her
back, and her robes drifting behind her, and visions
in her eye, and attitudinises to the verge of
despair. Also, she looks out at the stars a
great deal, and throws herself down on all the
furniture in succession, and then a sudden idea
strikes her and she throws herself up again. Still,
though she is more prolonged than most Juliets,
Mrs. Potter makes a reasonably good heroine,
and is brighter and more natural than usual, and
her elocution is far above the Potteresque average,
and the metallic ring in her voice is less pro-
nounced than it generally is, and she hardly
wriggles once, and she has got hold of the audi-
ence all the time. The Mercutio of Scot Inglis is
a fine, finished performance with hardly a flaw in
it, and is probably the best thing in the tragedy ;
and Bellew is a good enough Romeo, though he
hardly looks so young as that glittering Italian
ought to be, and he is even damper and more
weepful than the part seems to call for. The rest
of the co. includes an aggressively nude apothe-
cary — The Bulletin never saw such a nude
apothecary before, and when he sells the poison to
Romeo, there is a dreadful moment when it
seems as if his dish-cloth was going to fall off alto-
gether—and various others, who are all good
enough for any practical purpose.
The Bulletin, being a Goth and a Vandal,
candidly admits that it is somewhat tired of
“Romeo and Juliet.” Also, it believes that the
bulk of the community doesn’t care a straw for
that production in a literary sense, but is afraid
to say so, and that the play’s real popularity de-
pends largely on its intense hugginess. The fact
that Mrs. Potter hugs beautifully has made the
present “Romeo” season a decided success.
Shakespeare is a universally popular author whom
the mass of the community never reads, and the
most beloved dramatist on earth whom hardly
anybody goes to see for his own sake, and one of the
troubles of our effete civilisation is that it is neces-
sary in the name of culchaw to profess to love the
unread dramatist with an intense affection. There-
fore this paper has occasionally thought of starting
a society for being somewhat tired of the immortal
Shakesbacon, on the ground that it is better to be
a Goth and be candidly indifferent to him than
drag the corpse of the alleged enthusiasm around
any longer. Also it holds that the said enthusiasm
has become a corpse mostly because everybody
asserts so persistently that it is alive, and that the
Immortal Bard is being conventionally hoorayed
to death. In other words, it is afraid that if
people aren’t allowed to openly hate Shakespeare
they will presently give up liking him altogether,
and something bad will happen to the Bard. The
annual subscription to the new society for being
rather tired of Shakespeare will be 2s. 6d.

After the rush of the “ only authorised. ”
cinematographe, and the one that was partially
authorised, and the only one that didn’t say
whether it was authorised or not, Jimmy
MacMahon has opened still another cinema-
tographe in Pitt-street, opposite Sydney Lyceum.
This is the “ only real ” cinematographe—at least,
The Bulletin has heard so — and it is certainly
real enough for all purposes. The pictures are
beautifully clear and bright, and well-defined and
lifelike. In the ladies’ duel, the combatants
hustle off their skirts and emerge in reform cos-
tume, and prod each other in a masterly fashion.
The riding lesson, where the horse bucks every-
body off, is guaranteed genuine, for the cloud of
dust which arises when the rider’s head bangs
against the ground is clearly visible. The Royal
Artillery is about the most realistic picture in the
collection—the hundreds and thousands of uni-
formed warriors gallop past with their guns, in an
ever darkening haze as the dust-cloud which they
raise as they go rages more and more furiously ;
but the audience pins its faith principally to the
dancing girl—Loie Fuller, life-size, in about 25’
colors, amid a whirlwind of ankles and gaudy
skirts, and wild back-hair. Also, it loves a certain
upside-down picture of a busy street, where every-
thing is working backwards from its destination
to the place it started from. Some day The
Bulletin intends to fix up a picture of an execu-
tion on the same principle. It will begin with the
dissection of the criminal. Then he will go
together, and hang dead at the end of the rope,
and in a minute or two he will drop up alive and
retire to his cell and be untried. After which he
will go to his dead victim, and murder him back-
wards, thereby bringing him to life again. There
ought to be a fine moral lesson in this somewhere
—this paper doesn’t quite know where.
* * * *
The cinematographe is a very simple
machine after all. It works in a small back-room.
There are 3672 wheels in it, and each separate pic-
ture is made up of 30,000 photos, or thereabouts.
There are sundry electric wires about, which
would probably strike Jimmy MacMahon dead on
the spot if he got mixed up in them, and the light
is produced by a lighting apparatus which gives
out a heat of about 150 deg. Fahr. If any one of
the 3672 wheels goes wrong, or the wires trip up,
or anything sticks or bursts or slides, then several
thousand pounds worth of show will go to flinders
on the spot, and the very last picture of all will be
a distracted MacMahon trying to struggle out
from under the ruins.

Bland Holt leaves Sydney Royal after
Monday, and the fragmentary but gaudy “ St.
Paul’s ” will last out the brief remainder
of the season. The realism of the conflagra-
tion scene, when the Panther’s intoxicated hus-
band sets fire to the gilded haunt of sin and
wassail and dissipated evening-dress female, will
probably keep the show on a sound financial basis
to the end, despite the fact that Sutton Vane’s
tale seems to have been built in sections and then
dashed together with a club. George Rignold
will be the next occupant of the Royal, and as
Sydney has always had a warm spot in its heart
for Henry V., and he has been absent long enough
to be seriously missed, he should get a reception
which will make the ancient foundations shake.

The melodrama with the stuffed reptile in
it is steadily pursuing its habitual path of suicide,
premeditated butchery, crime, riot, arson, battle,
murder, forgery, and sudden death, and Her
Majesty’s is still doing well on the strength of it.
With a view, however, to the fact that even a
drama where everybody bathes in gore can’t go on
for ever, “Face to Face” is in preparation for
Saturday.

Nothing special has to be chronicled this
week about Sydney Tivoli, beyond the fact that
the Vaidis sisters have arrived, and have proved
to be reckless persons, whose trapeze performance
will some day lead to there being only one sister,
and afterwards no sister at all. Apart from this,
it is only necessary to mention that the old show
is prospering the same as usual, and that Harry
Rickards is accumulating more money than any
one man ought to have in a democratic com-
munity.

“ A Mother of Three,” at Melb. Bijou, is
discussing unstable trousers-buttons and the
horrors of solitary confinement for her legs in the
presence of crowded audiences. This comedy
tickles the soft female fancy, and makes strong
men more than ever doubtful of Mrs. Grundy’s
bona-fides. It seems to The Bulletin that
Brough’s unfettered show is under the patronage
of Mrs. G., who brings her girls along to laugh at
a long series of such broad suggestions and spicy
innuendoes as would strike the grim female stiff if
they were perpetrated in private life within her
family’s hearing. Therefore the complete success
of “ A Mother of Three ” is a matter for con-
gratulation. Written by a woman for women, it
will be accepted as an object-lesson in humor to suit
the fair sex. The politician of the future, wooing
female suffrage from a public platform, will know
the exact sort of funny remark to win a vote of
confidence with, and the bluer the Tory the bigger
will be his majority on polling-day. Meanwhile a
daily paper has remarked, with artless enthusiasm,
that Mrs. Brough deserves praise for not empha-
sising the cerulean points in her character-part,
and several newspapers have stated that the dia-
logue is very witty. Anyway, the show thrives
exceedingly, and everybody is glad to find the
Brough company travelling on top of the tide.

George Rignold’s advt. of “Henry V”
claims that “there is no vicious or evil thought
suggested from beginning to end.” But in all other
respects Shakespeare’s historical play is quite up to
date. King Henry, before and after Agincourt,
appoints himself special agent for Providence, just
as though he were the late King William or his
reigning grandson. Also the gallant monarch’s
threats of what would happen to the town of
Harfleur, if his troops were-compelled to carry it
by storm, might have been inspired by the very
latest details of Turkish atrocities in Armenia.
And what an immortal jingo was the Bard ! There
is one craven Hinglishman introduced into
“ Henry V,” yet he shines by comparison with his
French captive, whom he drags along with a rope.
Lord Scroope, the leading villain of the
piece, is a professional pietist of the modern
type, and the discontented soldier, complaining
that a battle is a bad end for any poor
private who may happen to get killed, speaks with
the tongue of Tommy Atkins. Even the funny
business in “Henry V.” has retained its original
freshness, because it deals chiefly with the unalter-
able vanities of human nature under the influence
of liquor. Altogether the production at Mel-
bourne Royal is a worthy thing, which appears to
have earned for Rignold Rex a lot more glory out
of doors than financial profit on the premises.
Audiences last week were large, but not large
enough for a show that employs 100 people on the
stage, so unless the fat-headed public should
become suddenly seised—as they say in Parlia-
ment —of the excellence of this fascinating jingo
lesson, it will be replaced on Saturday by some-
thing better suited to their lack of intelligence.
George Rignold’s season will conclude next week
in any case.

41 Djin-Djin ” Redivivus, at the Princess’s,
is not doing much better than might be expected,
and but for the enti'ancing Lumiere Cinemato-
graphe it would do much worse. The demand for
“ Djin-Djin ” must have evaporated to a great
degree since last February, not on account of the
present cast appearing inferior to the old one, but
for the reason that the best of pantomime hashes
is not worth warming up a second time. In
another week or so the Firm will, it is said, pro-
duce the new company of music-hall artists, ’ who,
having arrived under engagement to “Tatt.”
Adams, of Sydney, before the hall is ready for
them, are eating the bread of idleness at the im-
porter’s expense.

Next Thursday (19th) is the date appointed
for a huge matinee combination show in aid of
Melb. Blind Asylum, or, rather, for the advance-
ment of Lady Brasseys latest charity boom. The
Blind Asylum is a much smaller consideration
than Lady B. in this matter, but the money will
get there all the same.

The utterly conscienceless cussedness of
the Law and its myrmidons was exposed once
again last week at Melb. Exhibition Carnival. It
was the week in which the Government ordains a
public holiday for the benefit of all bookmakers,
the week when the hideous hypocrisy of the
Gambling Act is more hideous than usual, and a
rejected Totalisator Bill rises from a champagne-
sprinkled grave to jeer at the sweated punters who
put its opponents in power. On Saturday
night four detectives came round to warn
the Carnival management that race-games at
sixpence and a shilling per game were illegal, im-
moral, desperately wicked, and not to be any
longer endured by the authorities. This action is
said to have sprung from the case of a young
criminal tarradiddler, who pleaded that he had
been “ruined by gambling at church bazaars.”
Tickets in the golden art union have not been sup-
pressed, however ; likewise, the legality of Fitz-
geralds’ Circus remains unquestioned, so the
Carnival will proceed as before.

The Frantz Family and the ’Graphe figure
in large type on a satisfactory bill at the Opera
House, but the bills of the Alexandra and Cam-
bridge are withdrawn from circulation, and those
two receptacles for ill-starred enterprise have
lapsed into their normal condition of dust and
darkness.

The Carnival concert by Melbourne
Liedertafel, last week, was not far behind the best
work of its rival, the Metropolitan, in accuracy of
part singing. Perhaps the Metropolitan Lieder-
tafel male choristers, apart from the Associated
Ladies’ choir, are less obviously mechanical than
the other crowd, and if they have a slightly in-
ferior voice judged in the bulk, the difference is
not worth remarking. One well-trained Lieder-
tafel is very like another. Miss Edith O. King,
from Sydney, was the special new soloist for the
occasion, and artistically she filled the bill. But
in the big Town Hall, her light soprano seemed a
rather small matter compared with Maggie
Stirling’s fruity mezzo, which, by the way, was
“commanded” to warble Strezlecki’s “Dreams”
for His Excellency Brassey and suite. Gov. B.
has a sailor’s simple musical taste. Give him a
ballad, with a good tangible tune in it, in prefer-
ence to operatic kickshaws, you know.

Theatrical criticism in Melbourne Age and
Argus has of late been contemptible, sometimes
for its unfairness, and, almost invariably, for its
display of ignorance. Whilst anything staged at
the. Princess’s is pretty sure of the puff direct, pro-
ductions at the Royal are damned with faint
praise or mild disparagement. Allowing that the
relative justice or injustice of newspaper praise
and blame is a matter of opinion, nobody can deny
the absurdity of such stuff as the Age published
re George Rignold’s present revival of “Henry
V.,” a drama with which the veteran’s name is
identified all over the English-speaking world.
“ It was in this play,” says the Age critic, “ that
Mr. Rignold first made the acquaintance of a Mel-
bourne audience 12 years ago. . . . He is a
little too ample in girth and limb to correctly
represent the physical aspect of Shakespeare’s
youthful hero, but all the kingly dignity and
resolve and courage of the young man suddenly
ennobled and grown grave with weight of office
he portrays with a high measure of success.”
Twelve years ago Rignold was in management at
Melb. Opera House, where he appeared in
numerous plays previous to the revival of Henry
V. His first acquaintance with Melb. audiences
had been made long before then at the Royal. As
regards his present impersonation of Shakespeare’s
“youthful hero,” what are the facts? Rignold is
to all stage appearances a handsome, sturdy hero
of, ,say, 35. The real Henry was in his 28th
year at the Battle of Agincourt, and when
the Treaty of Troyes (where Shakespeare’s
drama concludes) • • arrived, the “youthful”
monarch had reached the age of 32. There
is really no excuse for captious criticism of
Rignold s present girth and limb measurements
in his famous impersonation, whereas there is
much cause for praising his elocution, by-play, and
naturalism, which, by comparison with the Age’s
extravagant lauding of less accomplished per-
formers in less exacting parts, are scarcely praised
at all. For a daily newspaper to say that Rignold
as Henry Y. achieves “ a high measure of success ”
is to insinuate that several other actors could be
found to do the work as well as he, if not better.
Where are they? ,
At Poverty Point.
The theatrical column of the Melb. organ of the
W.C.T.U. gives a portrait of Hilda Spong as Rosalind, the
contours of her lovely legs being carefully blacked out—
apparently out of consideration for its readers. The man
or woman who would black out Hilda's beauteous under-
standings ought to be put to death as a public enemy.
Re the production of “ The Duchess of Coolgardie ” at
Drury Lane, a guileless commentator writes in Melb Age :
“ It speaks very little for the conmionsense of the West
Australian ring that they should have found the money
for so ridiculous a melodrama.” Now, to The Bulletin’s
way of thinking, the Westralian boomsters did a fine
stroke of business in getting their wicked mining fable
staged at Drury Line, even if it didn’t run for more than
a week. “The Duchess of Coolgardie”! Plot—The
heroine, a beauteous barmaid, is unjustly suspected ol
giddiness by her lover, who rushes forth into the pheno-
menally auriferous Coolgardie district, and finds a gold-
mine at one fell swoop. If that advt. doesn’t give a fillip
to the wild-oat trade, London must indeed have had
enough of Westralian speculation for the present.
The impressionable Clement Scott re Hilda Spong:—
“Very welcome . . . tall, fair, with a graceful presence,
a sweet voice, and expressive face . . . every gift that
nature can bestow upon her . . . that true' cry of the
heart without which mere physical beauty is valueless . . .
exquisitely pathetic note . . . too delicate in taste and
timbre for the rush and petulance arid soreain 'and shout
of melodrama.” Also : “ Have we no't here the material
of which Lady Constances are made ? Here, surely, is a
Shakespearean actress, a probable Rosalind, a certain
Desdeinona. . . . Under good instruction'and after care-
ful, study, she should be the actress'for the plan's of
Dumas, Sardou, and Scribe, for the jnore modern studies
of Pinero, Grundy, Henry Arthur Jones, and Carton. . .
With this wonderful supply of talent on tap, it will be
very surprising if she does not make good her position. . .
We want actresses as sensitive, as delicate, as highly-
strung and as truly emotional as Miss Hilda Spong. She
has grace and beauty, and, better still, she has ideality
and heart.” Whoop !
Clement Scott comes in for severe handling by the Nkw
Saturday review, for his very eulogistic notice of-the
“ Duchess of Coolgardie,” now said to be the work of
Drury lane Manager, John Coleman, and an(y)other, as it
is not a success. C. S. stated in the Telegraph the play
formed “a very interesting study of modern colonial life,
and tliat it furnishes very accurate information as to the
details of Australian mining life.” “ Each of these state-
ments is distinctly untrue ” says the New Saturday ;
“there is no more suggestion of colonial life, or colonial
mining life in the “Duchess of Coolgardie” than is at
present provided by the disturbed condition of Piccadilly
circus ” (where the roadway is up for repairs). With which
verdict an Australian (writes The Bulletin’s correspon-
dent) must agree after witnessing this Westralian
extravaganza. Billy Elton withdrew from the cast at the
last moment through some disagreement.
At an Australian theatre, which it would be cruel to
further particularise, the lessee has been recently running
a scratch Co. with himself as leading mail. At five
minutes to eight one night there was not a soul in the
theatre, and for the last week the audience didn’t average
30 per night !
The news that Frances Saville has instituted divorce-
proceedings against her husband falls very flat. So many
lady artists have made connubial shipwreck that, as an
advt., the incident, like the lost jewel-case, has grown
stale. Only one resource is left to;.the would-be celebrity
or prima-donna—to get her nanie involved in a scandal
with a king. The public appreciation of soiled doves is
insatiable if the mud be aristocratic.
Infatuated Irvingites waited outside London Lyceum
for twelve hours, so as to ensure a ‘ first night ’ view of
their much-mannerised hero in Shakespeare’s “Cymbe-
line.” They brought their damper and billies with them,
and all through a miserable chilly day these fanatical
devotees chewed and chatted and discovered what an in-
efficient support a pair of bony or flabby legs are when
called on to prop up an exhausted body from 8 a.in. to 8
p.m. When the play began, a much-chafed, considerably-
warped crowd, shedding hair pins and loose locks, fell
heavily into the front seats, and applauded furiously and
indiscriminately, hoping to shake Off the ‘ slept-in-your-
clothes’ feeling, or their resemblance to stagnant, half-
frozen dirty puddles. And then the critics gave the show
universal ‘slops.
The demise of “What Cheer ’Ria” Bessie Bellwood
(writes The Bulletin’s London correspondent) removes
the last of the witty, smutty, rearly-repartee idols of the
Halls. Impromptu wit and original .freshness have been
succeeded by labored coarse, or vulgar, humor and deadly
respectable cleverness. Bessie was Irishly impulsive, and,
some of her retorts to the jibing gods ” were more
crushing than choice. On one occasion the audience
chose to see an evil meaning in her apology for late ap-
pearance, and roared loud and lustily. The indignant
artiste shouted out, “ You dirty beasts, I didn’t mean
that,’’ which “ broke up ’’ and disorganised the house for
that evening. A recent satirical article on the “Halls”
appeared in the Saturday Review, and referred to “ Mis 3
Elizabeth Bellwood —that remarkable moral force in a
Paisley shawl.”
Interesting to hear the silvery laughter of female
sassietv at Melb. Bijou when the Mother of Three begs
her daughters to assure her that nothing has gone wrong
with her trousers. The more puerile the coarseness the
“ funnier” it seems to these partially unclad angels.
Harry Rickards, supported by his wife and daughtersi
played a domestic character at the Cup with great success.
Like all of the Chosen—or nearly all of them—Rickards
makes a capital family man.
Rignold found trouble in getting a reliable stage-horse
for Henry V.’s entry into London. A rampageous animal
that he tried for a night or two concluded its engagement
by buck-jumping behind the scenes, and King Henry had

The gross takings at Melb. Exhibition Carnival on Cup-

Tragedian Miln got home badly; on N.Y. critics recently
when they slated his Shakespearian revivals. His last-
night speech ran : “Ladies and gentlemen, 1 thank you.
After 14 years’ apprenticeship I have come to New York
to find that this great metropolis has outgrown Shake-
speare. When I come here again, it shall be on the same
lofty heights Where the New' York critics abide.”
Who dares say Shakespeare is neglected? Melb. with

Cecil Ward’s only insuperable fault was a tinpotty

Coppin has been casting up'his memories of Brooke
with undying affection. On his last visit to London

In reply to 18 people who, inspired by the U.S.
elections, "have written to The Bulletin, at great length,
on the “ fneejum of exchange,” and 176 mote people
whose letters will probably arrive next week, this paper
tries to state, as clearly as possible, how it sits on the
fence upon this subject. If a country has a currency
based on gold only, then it doesn’t matter much wr ether
you coin one sovereign or eight out of an ounce of gold ,
the coin will find its level and the prices of other things
will adjust themselves to it. If there are 20 shillings in
the sovereign, and the sovereign contains an ounce of
gold, then tea will probably be 4d. per lb. ; if there are 20
shillings in the sovereign, but the latter only contains an
eighth of an ounce of gold, then the same tea will be 2s.
Bd. per lb. If there, is a silver currency only, then it
doesn’t matter whether the alleged shilling or dollar or
yen, or whatever the standard coin may be, represents joz.
of silver or lOoz.; the prices of commodities will adjust
themselves to it. If a country has a gold and silver
standard, and they are both legal tender, and there are
20s. in the £, then it is necessary, in order to keep things
straight, that the silver in 20s. should have the same, or
practically the same, market value as the gold contained
in the sovereign, and that the prices should keep at the
same rates or very near it. Therefore, if the U.S. started
coining legal tender silver on the present basis, which is
practically that 30oz. silver equal loz. gold, and the
demand thereby created made silver go up in price, some-
thing would depreciate (gold, The Bulletin thinks, but
the situation is so mixed that it is difficult to be sure of
anything). And if it started coining legal tender silver on
the assumption that 16oz. silver equalled loz. gold (which
it doesn’t), and the demand thus created wasn’t sufficient
to raise-the price of silver so that it would really be
worth one-sixteenth as much as gold in the open market,
then silver coin would begin to depreciate or would have
been depreciated all along. And when there are two
standards, and one of them is depreciated, something
happens—The Bulletin doesn’t exactly remember what.
Apparently the way to establish a double stan-
dard (supposing one country tackles it by itself) is to
think out this problem. The relative prices of gold and
silver are so much. The relative production of gold is so
many tons per annum, and of silver so many tons per
annum. The surplus of each, after providing for the
world’s present requirements (said requirements to be
figured out carefully) is so much. The production of one
metal is likely to increase or diminish so much, and of the
other metal so much also. The demand for each is likely
to increase or diminish at such and such a rate until in so
many years it is so much. The stock on hand of each
metal is so much, of which x represents the amount in
actual use, and y represents the surplus, if there is one.
Allowing, therefore, that the standard to be set up is ex-
pected to be fixed and permanent for, say, a century,
the average surplus over requirements during that
period, after allowing for present supplies, present and
probable future production, and present and probable
future requirements On the present and probable future
basis of things, is likely to be so much. The establish-
ment of a silver standard in this country will increase the
demand to a certain extent, to be carefully estimated.
The increased demand will lead to increase of supply by a
certain, number of tons per annum. The present price
being so-and-so, this change in the relative demand
and supply will make the average future price so-
and-so, and if the new silver coinage is based on
that price it will- be a stable affair which will
neither depreciate nor appreciate, and thereby lead
to trouble. If other countries (not allowed for in the
estimate) also establish a silver standard, and increase the
demand beyond what was expected, and thus raise the
price further than: was reckoned upon, there will probably
be chaos. If some of the present silver countries unex-
pectedly abandon "silver and thus decrease the demand
and lower the price in an unlooked-for fashion, there
will prbbably be frenzy. If the calculation prove unex-
pectedly very far wrong in some other respects, then there
will, most likely be h—l. This is The Bulletin’s idea of
the bi-metallic problem as far as concerns the U.S. or any
other country which tries to settle the question “on its
own,” subject, of course, to correction from the 176 cor-
respondents whose letters re the “meejum of exchange”
haven’t: yet come to hand.
Roughly speaking, mono-metallism is entering
one horse for a race all by himself, and betting that he
will always keep pace with himself—which he generally
does. And bi-metallism is entering two horses for a race
that is. to last a century or two, and betting that they will
exactly keep pace with each other, which is a much larger
contract and requires a lot of careful management.

There is a considerable scarcity of information
as to how the N.S.W. local 3 per cent, loan is going off.
When it was first put on the market it was announced
that £150,000 had been subscribed within three days, and
since then there has been comparative silence. It has
since been alleged on more or less unreliable authority that
this £150,000 was not subscribed by the public, but con-
sisted of certain trust funds under Government control,
and that though the public is taking up the new stock it
is doing so very gradually. The fact can’t be got over
that the 3 per cent, issue at par is a very shabby way of
encouraging the local investor. The 3 per cent, loan re-
cently floated in London was sold at £95 2s. net, and costs
the State £3 4s. per cent, interest, while the amount
offered to the miserable Cornstalk capitalist is £3, less in-
come-tax from which the British investor is exempt.
Allowing for the income-tax and the saving in exchange
through not having to remit interest to England, the
local investor should have been offered 3} per cent, to
Sut him on a level with the favored Bull. The Reid
[inistry, however, isn’t alone in the opinion that the
British speculator, should be offered better terms than the
local one.. When the Maoriland Government wanted
£2,000,000 at 4 per cent, to prop up the B.N.Z. it sold the
loan in London and didn't give the M.L. investor a look-
in. Then it-gave him a chance to put his money into
Maoriland Consols at'3£ per cent, and felt good over it.
**;; * • *
Tasmania also proposes to float a 3 percent, loan
locally at par, the amount asked for being l 250,000.
Considering that last year Tasmania floated a loan in
London at a price which cost the province £3 12s. Bd. per
cent., this demand that the Tas. investor should be con-
tent with £3 per cent, net is an attempt to shear the local
capitalist pretty close. Apparently Treas Fysh, like
Treas. Reid, thinks that the local man should only get a
chance to put his money into Govt, securities if he will
accept a great deal less interest than is paid to J. Bull.
If he won’t put up the money at 3 per cent, presumably
Bull will get-the loan at 3£, and it will be announced that
the local market is a failure !
* » * *
Queensland, which already has a large and
gorgeous debt equal to a little over £69 per head —the
biggest debt per head in the world —proposes to float
another loan of £1,000,000.

Westralian Government’s two loan Bills, which,
taken together, provide for adding £6,000,000 to the
public debt, have both been passed almost without oppo-
sition. When this money conies in the grand old boom
should make a fresh start and rage gloriously.
The London Bank of Australia has decided,
like a lot of other banks, to attempt some further
arrangement of its affairs, and intends applying to its
depositors for a reduction of interest. The London,
which has hitherto been doing reasonably well, seems to
have struck a sudden patch of bad luck. Last half-year
the profit-balance carried forward was £11,167 ; it is now'
cabled as £10,935, so it w'ould seem that the six months
operations have resulted in a loss of £232. The profits
for the previous three half-years were (December,’9s),
£5673; (June, ’95), £7082; (December, ’94), £8216; so
they have been pers stently fading for some time past,
and the alleged slump is hardly surprising. Also, the
institution seems to have paid its usual 5% per cent,
dividend on preference shares (£4728) out of the loss, and
thereby reduced its accumulated profit balance to £6207,
which is a decline of £4960 in six months.
The London Bank has reduced its reconstructed
deposits in two years from £4,800,000 to £3,800,000, but
this relief doesn’t seem to have done it any permanent
good. It has £1,500,000 cash on hand, which is more
than the w'hole amount of its new deposits and current
accounts, and it has no reconstructed deposits falling due
till 1900. Therefore, it looks as if it could easily pay off
half-a-million more of its 4J per cent, deposits, and thus
save £22,500 a year in interest. If things become no
worse, and if the institution gets a reduction of interest
to 3 per cent, (which is about the ordinary figure just
now), it ought to show a profit of £55,000 a year, which
would enable it to pay a 3 per cent, dividend on its ordi-
nary shares as well as the usual 5(- per cent, on
preference stocks. But the London has already made very
large savings by paying off part of its 4£ percent, deposits,
and the saving has all been absorbed by the steady falling
off in profits, and things have grown worse instead of
better, so the probabilities are that the new'saving, if it
is effected, will be gradually absorbed by the steady reduc-
tion in banking profits, and the ordinary shareholders will
be as far off their dividend as ever. The falling-off in
banking profits seems to have absolutely no end. The
North Queensland, Commercial of Sydney, National, Vic-
toria, and Colonial all made large savings, four of them
by paying off high-priced deposits, and the fifth by re-
ducing interest, and the depression absorbed the savings
as fast as they were made and left things very much where
they were. The absorbing capacity of the depression
seems simply incalculable.

N.S.W. revenue for October is .£26,156 less than
for October, ’95. Tasmania shows an increase of £19,085.
Queensland has an increase of £17,882; Victoria, an in-
crease of £21,892; Westralia shows an improvement of
about £60,000.

According to the report just presented to Maori-
land Parliament, the Bank of N.Z. Estates Co., when it
raised its famous loan of £1,500,000 in London, paid
£305,000 in discounts and expenses for the accommoda-
tion. Also, it paid 5) per cent, interest, so during the
four years that the loan existed it cost the co. 12 per
cent, on the money actually realised. What a sample of
private banking management!

Hudson Bros. (Limited), a huge N.S.W. en-
gineering enterprise representing £360,000 of capital, has
decided to w'ind up. Most of the capital has already been
written off as lost, and the shares have been valueless for
some time. In his budget speech of July 9, Premier Reid
pointed enthusiastically to this co. as an example of the
prosperity which came of Foreign-raid, and stated that it
was just beginning to boom for the first time in several
years. The present collapse suggests that Jollyandfat
had blind staggers in his facts, as usual.

Treasurer Reid (N.S.W.) was so far moved by
the jeers of the Opposition at his “permanent and re-
productive” loan items that the additions to the Art
Gallery and the foundations of Gov. Phillip’s statue are
not to be made permanent burdens but are to go into the
section of the loan expenditure which is supposed to be
repaid by instalments spread over 30 years. This new way
of fooling the country is just as objectionable as the old
one. The instalment can only be paid if there is a sur-
plus. There has been a deficit almost every year for many
years (even the year of Reid’s £330,000 alleged surplus is
shown in Coghlan’s latest “ Seven Colonies” to have had
£600,000 shortage); there is no prospect of the required
surplus unless more revenue is raised, and the revenue is
steadily diminishing instead of increasing. Therefore, the
pretence of paying for old hangman Phillip’s st itue in 30
years when there is no provision made for finding the
money is a mere formality.

The Vic. Upper House has struck a snag. It
referred the Companies’ Bill to a committee whose business
it was to take evidence from reliable capitalists, and
supply reasons for rejecting the measure. But the
carefully-selected capitalists didn’t object nearly so much
as was expected, and their case was miserably weak all
through, and the committee, instead of presenting the re-
port anticipated, only Suggested a few comparatively
small amendments. Now, the Council has either got to
accept most of the measure, or reject it despite the fact
that its committee, after patient inquiry and much evi-
dence, gave no reasons for so doing, and 48 very grumpy
old men are considering the situation.

Judged by statistics, Victorian industry touched
bottom in ’93 or ’94, and since then a distinct revival has
set in. Butter and cheese factories employed 360 hands
in ’93 and 820 hands in ’95. Woollen mills employed 552
hands in ’93 and 690 in ’95. Flour mills, 685 hands in ’93
and 705 in ’95. Brew'eries, 960 hands in ’94 and 1007 in
’95. Distilleries, 127 hands in ’93 and 155 in ’95. Tobacco
faci ories, 588 hands in ’93 and 772 in ’95. Soap and candle
works, 375 hands in ’93 against 438 in ’95. The number of
hands employed in tanneries rose, in the two years, from
1492 to 1639. In brickyards, the figures were 897 in ’94
and 964 in ’95. Taking ifactori.es, works and quarries
all together, the employes in ’95 were 1458 more than in
’94 —the first real improvement since 1890.

The story goes that another colossal universal-

In Edwards v. Melb. Metropolitan Board of
Works, plaintiff’s costs were-taxed at £1762, so that this
action, which could at the outset have been settled for
£lOO, cannot have cost the M. B. W. less than £5OOO. As the
Board’s servants lit a fire which burnt plaintiff’s crop and
fences, any honest man would have admitted the liability
and settled with good grace.

Total sugar manufactured in Q’sland for the
year ending 30th June, ’95, was 86,255 tons. This,shows a
decrease on the preceding year of 5457 tons, in spite* of
the greater area under cane. Decrease due principally to
grubs in the north and frost in the south. The yield for
the year was only 29Jcwt. per acre. Domestic consump-
tion required 24,191 tons ; export, 62,064 tons —all to other
Australasian provinces.

Mines Minister Smith has been called upon to
defend the little toy plant at the Clyde, called “ the
N.S.W. Govt. Metallurgical Works,” and his defence is as
weak as the works. He w'as informed that another £2OO
would enable the plant to treat 100 tons a week, and he
had authorised the erection of chlorination and cyanide
plants. If it takes a year to put lip the toy works, how
long will be occupied in erecting the additions now
authorised? AVanted in N.S.AV. a Mines Minister who
knows something of the business. Hardly possible while
selection is confined to M’sP. Why not have a well-
paid, expert Mines Commissioner to conduct the whole
business free from political interference?
* * * *
N.S.W. Mines Minister Smith, in referring to
the “Govt. Metallurgical Works,” said it was intended to
increase their crushing capacity “ by the erection of Frue
vanners,” and then wondered why some of the more
knowing members laughed. ’Tis said that the works have
been started on ore containing a large percentage of anti-
mony. These toy works will produce more curses
than metal, precious or otherwise. They will add to the
humiliation of the N.S.W. Mines Department, which is
sufficiently disgraced already.

N.S.W. has got a cinnabar mine in the North,
and the mine has got a well-satisfied and confident man-
ager : “I think the ore we are now getting is better than
the prospector’s. It shows antimony, but the antimony
will disappear as depth is reached.” If it does, the
manager has made a correct guess, and the betting is
only even anyway.

The half-yearly report of the Broken Hill Junc-
tion Co. is no better than shareholders and the public had
reasonable grounds to expect. By a skilful arrangement
of dates the six months embraced but five dividends ; and
the accounts show that in order to pay even these, totalling
£25,000, the previously-earned and undistributed profits
had to be encroached upon to the extent of a few pence
short of £3OOO. The answer to this probably will be that,
as the directors put it, the cost of railway and sidings to
connect with the Silverton line has been borne, while
“large sums have been disbursed for machinery and
general mine equipment and development.” The "heavi-
ness of the flow of water encountered when the lode was
struck in the deep level also interfered with operations
and entailed expense. But, as against all this, it has to
be put that of the 36,000 tons of ore of all grades dealt
with during the term about 18,000 tons were high-grade
stuff—from 26 to 290 z. and from 35 j to 36 per cent, lead
per ton. And it is quite certain that half the ore in the
mine is not of that grade, so that this good-quality stuff
was disproportionately extracted. The directors don't
say that in those words, but they do say it in these: —
“ There are enormous bodies of second-grade ore assaying
about 20oz. silver and 28 per cent, lead that cannot be so
readily disposed of” (they had said they had been rushed
for the high-grade ore), “ although negotiations are pend-
ing for the sale of large quantities ; and unless satisfactory
arrangements are made at an early date the directors pro-
pose to increase the ore-reduction plant to the capacity
of, say, 2000 tons of crude ore per week, for the product
of which there is a large demand.” With the most recent
additions the plant has a capacity of 1000 tons weekly.
Altogether 36,000 tons of ore have been used up
and the profit is £22,000. That is a fraction under 12s. 3d.
per ton. But, as before said, shareholders cannot place
much reliance on these figures as a guide to the value (to
them) of the average ore in the mine. It may be more
than that or it may be less. On the face of it, seeing that
a disproportionately large quantity of high-grade ore was
sold, the value should be much lower. That, however, is
not certain, because by' concentrating instead of selling
outright the lower-grade ore a higher profit per ton may
be made out of it. Yet on past experience this milling
(lower grade) ore will not return a profit of more than
about 9s. per ton at the very outside. At that rate a plant
for treating 2000 tons per week would give enough profit
to pay 3i divs. in the six months. Then there is the
higher-grade ore to be sold outright. With silver and
lead at their present prices the shilling div. ought, there-
fore, to be reasonably possible. But with even a small
decline in the price of either metal the div. will only be
regularly maintained at the expense of a further dispro-
portionate extraction of the richer stuff—by repeating,
that is, in connection with the sulphides what was done
in connection with the carbonate and other rich smelting
ores —a policy' which came near ruining even the Barrier
silver-mining industry.
The Junction directors intimate that a London
office has been opened “ for the registration and transfer
of shares and the payment of dividends,” and a London
board of six has been appointed. Most, if not all, of these
six are said to be not unknown to the Camden (John
Howell's Illawarra works) syndicate.
An interesting calculation has been made to
show the proportion of the value of the contained metals
in the sulphides which reached the Junction Co. “There
were in the concentrates and crude ore despatched from
the mine approximately 721,0000 z. silver and 9960 tonslead,
of the aggregate value of £189,710. For this the co. got
just over £60,000. Out of £60,000 it had to pay £12,000
for freights, &c., £4600 for mine timber, £2047 for fuel,
and over £16,000 for wages.” Leaving £22,000 for the
shareholders. But this proportion is higher than usual
with sulphide-mining cos. on account of the unusually-high
value of the sulphides.
Block 14, for example, sent away during its last
half-year, also just ended, the following quantities of stuff :
Carbonate ore to smelting works, 6549 tons; carbonate con-
centrates to ditto, 108 tons; sulphide concentrates to ditto,
7835 tons ; sulphide concentrates for shipment, 7629 tons ;
slimes to smelting works, 4620 tons ; zinc concentrates for
shipment, 982 tons—a total of 27,623 tons. But this re-
presents about 72,000 tons of ore, because 64,607 tons of
ore was required to produce the concentrates and slimes
turned out during the half-year. Also, time
£5OOO onl.y was paid in divs., although a further £7752
was spent on plant and machinery, and the liquid assets
were increased by £5223. The co. doesn’t give much in-
formation about its ores : but it bought nearly 10,000 tons
of sulphides for the Junction which assayed 20oz.
silver and 28 per cent. lead. That is slightly beyond Block
14’s own average, and also the Central’s. The average
of the ore treated would be about 18oz. silver and
25 per cent. lead. The approximate value of the contained
silver and lead, as shown by assay, would be £340,000 ;
out of which the co. gets fairly, say, £ls,ooo—because the
whole of the additions to the plant, &c., can hardly be
reckoned in. The balance of 1.325,000 (not to speak of the
zinc) goes for wages, timber, fuel, freight, stores—and
over the dump. Much of it over the dump. And this is
the best that such skilled, persistent men as Mr. T. J.
Greenway, the general manager, can do with the great
sulphide problem up to date. Giving Block 14 the
whole £15,000 as profit, the ore treated during this last
half-year yielded just 4s. 2d. per ton profit. Taking only
the amount distributed and added to liquid assets, the
profit comes down to 2s. Bd. per ton.
Says general manager Green way, of Block 14 :
“ We have continued our experimental operations bearing
upon the production of marketable zinc concentrates, and
much valuable experience has been gained. During the
half-year we have produced -nearly 1000 tons of this pro-
duct with satisfactory results'. I am now preparing plans
for a small zinc plant, which I hope to submit for your
consideration in a short time.”

“ The Mt. Drysdalemine has sent 14 tons of ore
to Oobar for treatment.” Presumably to the Oobar cop-
per mine. Two years ago, when Drysdale shares went to
£BOO each, they were sending ore to Wallaroo, S.A., and
elsewhere, at a cost of about £lO a ton. They spent over
£lO,OOO in this way, while the ore could have been thrown
into the Cobar water-jackets and treated at a cost of at
most fl a ton. That is what they propose to do now the
mine has next to no ore to treat.

The writer has been privileged to see a copy of
the “private and confidential” prospectus of the “ Bar-
rass and Conley Freehold G.M. Syndicate,” Cobar,
N.S.W. Capital, £64,000, divided into 100 shares of £640
each, payable £l6O on application, balance as arranged.
Object, to buy one-half interest from the present owners,
and, in conjunction with them, to form a no-liability co. ;
capital, £200,000, in 400,000 shares of 10s. each. The syn-
dicate’s £64,000 to be applied—£4o,ooo to owners and
£20,000 working capital, and £4OOO to cover commission
and other charges, securing the property and floating
the syndicate. If the public take up the shares when the
£200,000 co. is formed, the holder of each syndicate share
will get 800 bonus shares. In other words, l-5th of the
whole property will be given for underwriting the amount
to be paid the owners, providing the working capital and
the £4000 commission, charges, &c. If the public don’t
come in, the syndicate will be “ stuck ” with it, though
the prospectus doesn’t say so. Underwriting mines is a
new business here, and to underwrite by prospectus is
quite a novelty anywhere. The only information re the
mine is a statement that 1201 tons have been crushed for
3552oz. Very good, but not so much as the public have been
led by the press to believe had been got out of the mine.
Everything depends on how much of this sort of stuff is
left in it. Before forming either a syndicate ora co. of the
size proposed some attempt should be made to expose ton-
nage. It is fair to remember that, allowing only a fair
amount for cost of raising and treatment," &c., it will take
as much gold as the owners have got out altogether to
pay one little 6d. div. on 400,000 shares, and they have
worked the mine for over a year.

The prospecting syndicate boring in the Orange
district have struck payable wash in their No. 5 bore.
“ Miners who saw the result say it is equal to from loz. to
2oz. to the ton.” Nothing very definite about that. A
big lead of loz. stuff would about warrant the co.’s modest
name, “The Ballarat of N.S.W. G.M. Co.”

From a Westralian mining man of the highest
repute : —“ Dear Bulletin, do all you can to stop this
mad rush of men to this goldfield, especially at this time
of the year. What with the ‘ slump ’ in England and
the terrible heat and drought, I cannot but think an
exodus must take place from here immediately.” At-
tached is a newspaper clipping :—“ Patients are beginning
to arrive in increased numbers at the Govt. Hospital
(Coolgardie) daily, and yesterday no fewer than seven
were admitted, three suffering from typhoid fever, two
from dysentery, and the others from different disorders.
Now tliat the hot weather has set in fever is steadily on
the increase, and by next month the fever season may
fairly be said to have s»t in.”

The first report from the new boss of the General
Gordon mine in W.A., will not set the share-market on
fire. “ At this level (70ft.) lode was cut through from
footwall to hanging wall, showing formation 41ft. in
width. Drive on course of lode 46ft., formation showing
gold in several places. A drive also driven from this
level south, the end shows fairly good prospects by dolly-
ing, gold being extremely fine.” Not much change out of
that !
* * * •
Another falling-off in the Westralian gold-return
for Oct., compared with the previous month —27,331oz.
against 35,301oz. It is some 400oz. lower than Oct. last
year. But there is always an excuse. This time some
OOOOoz. left after the month, but was produced in it.
Well, this month will get the benefit of it, and when it
does the writer will bet that not a word is said about it.
Over 12,000oz. came from East Coolgardie (Hannan’s), and
nearly all of this from three mines which are producing
about one-third of the W.A. gold. Murchison, like most
Westralian mines, “wobbles” horribly. Last month it
returned 15,000oz., this only 3018oz. Dundas, too, after
working itself up to a monthly return of some hundreds
of oz., has gone back this month to 7oz. ! Instead of
undergoing the strain of inventing excuses, why doesn’t
some W.A. newspaper-man work out a return showing
how much these monthly returns represent for each
working mine in the country ? It would be interesting as
showing that, in a country where mining is dearer than in
any other part of the world, the owners are satisfied with
the least return.

A start is about being made with Burbank’s
Birthday Gift Co.’s battery, a few miles south of Cool-
gardie, of which property Prof. Nicholas is superintend-
ing engineer. By the way, he is often confounded with
Mr. F. Nicolas, who came from some gold-mines in India
to look after the Armadale and other mines in W.A., and
whose name is often in the Coolgardie papers.

Golconda, Lake Austin, W.A. : 502 tons,
1181oz. ; Polar Star, 83 tons, 331oz. Cue No. 1 : 309 tons,
226oz. —if correct, a very big fall.
* « * *
Lady Shenton, Menzies, W.A., 300 tons, 1264oz.
Brown Hill, 254 tons, 686oz. (When is this mine likely to
have continuous crushing?) Mexico, Niagara, 37 tons,
183oz. North Boulder, 133 tons, 332oz.
* * * *
The fact that many thousands of gallons of
water are daily drawn from surrounding mines for
the Boulder, Ivanhoe, and Lake View batteries only
shows the trouble and enormous expense these mines are
put to to keep going. First it is one and then another
that furnishes water. Never a word of the cost of taking
up pipes and pumps and relaying them. Only rich mines
can stand it. Ordinary mines have no show in the West.

Esperance : “ The Chamber of Mines has de-
cided to advocate the Esperance-Coolgardie railway. The
co-operation of other fields will be enlisted, and the Pre-
mier’s objections will be fought with vigor. The aid of
London capitalists and Chamber of Commerce will be in-
voked.” In spite of Alick Forrest’s wild declarations
before he went to London, the Westralian Govt, will be
forced either to build this line or allow it to be built.

Gippsland (Vie.) for the first nine months of ’92
yielded 25,778oz. gold ; similar period, ’93, 38,078oz. ;
ditto, 1894, 51,109oz.; ditto, 1895, 63,425oz. ; first nine
months of 1896, 80,159oz. Which is another reason why
it is good policy for Vic. Government tq spend money on
opening up this hitherto neglected and despised end of
the province. Gippsland is the coal region and apparently
the most promising new gold region in Victoria, and it
has many other possibilities if they only had a chance to
develope themselves.

Charters Towers, last month—22,239 tons,

£100,000. When will the public know what relation calls
have to divs. in Westralia?
Queensland Govt, lately despatched an
emissary to America to study the tick question.
Boiled down, the report of the delegate amounts
to this: Dipping (on sf large scale) is not a success ;
inoculation is also mainly a failure ; and Queens-
land is much ahead of America in tick investiga-
tion. A certain proportion (from 2 to 5 per cent.)
of cattle die from the scourge, and the rest
become immune or tick-proof. All of which con-
clusions had been anticipated by such men as
plain, practical millionaire Tyson.

Hermes : ‘ ‘ The boarding-out system of
the Orphan-schools is not a thing of unmixed
beauty. In Hyde Park (Sydney) I saw a poor
child of 14 years in charge of three rough young-
sters, two of whom were howling hideously and
absolutely refused to walk, and the child had to
carry the little wretches in turns to the tram-shed
while they kicked and punched her on the legs
and face. She stated, in answer to enquiries, that
she was an orphan ; that her mistress was paid by
Govt, for keeping her ; that she had to look after
the children and help in the house ; and that if
she gave her name and address her mistress would
beat her dreadfully.”

A gruesome yam of Westralia. A typhoid
patient arrived at the hospital, having been driven
many miles in a buggy. There was no room in

and the only suggestion which the staff could make
was that one patient was dying and his bed would
certainly be vacant very shortly, and if the new

mfferer was kept in the shade on the lee-side of
the institution till then he could have it. Accord-
ingly the horse and the good man in charge and the
typhoid man followed the narrow shadows round
the wall, and patiently flicked the flies off them-
selves and each other for a long, long time. Now
and then the philanthropist in charge put his
anxious head in at the front door and asked if the
other man hadn’t pegged out yet. No, he hadn’t
pegged out. Well, when would he die ? The staff
couldn’t say to a minute, but his death was abso-
lutely certain. Well—the philanthropist put this
pomt persuasively—in that case couldn’t they
hurry him up a little in the name of humanity,
and naake room for the new man. The staff
didn t see its way to hurry him up, and the visitor
went back doggedly to his little patch of shade to
blow the flies off his sufferer once more, and to
curse the horse because it wouldn’t “ Woa.”
h inally, when the shadow had died down to almost
nothing the glad news came that the other man
was dead at last, and the new patient was inserted

horse were only a black dot on the long immensity
of the dust-road which led back home.

A Melbourne lady, who is applying for a
divorce, states a most unusual ease. She says that
she and her .husband lived together happily for
some years, till he informed her that he loved an-
other woman, and could no longer profess affection
for her. He made the statement in a perfectly
courteous manner; there was no abuse, or lan-
*-*r breakage of dishes, or hysterics, only
thereafter they occupied separate rooms, and,
when they met on the stairs or elsewhere, they
treated each other with distant politeness. Later
on, she took a boarding-house, and he came to live
there, and was a model boarder. He always paid
up to date, never grumbled at the hash, and was
courteous, though distant. Also, the other lady
that he loved was never seen or heard of, and the
wife doesn’t allege any misoonduot. Her case is
that she has been deserted, inasmuch as the old
man left her and fled into the next room, and she
claims that his action in becoming a strange
boarder in the house, and dreaming of some person
or persons unknown, is equivalent to abandonment.
The Bulletin is inclined to agree with the lady.
Desertion into the next room, if persisted in for
six years, seems about the same as desertion into
the next continent. In fact, it seems to combine
all the disadvantages of ordinary desertion with-
out any of its advantages ; the all-seeing eye of
the old man is still there, yet he has ceased to be
the old man in the ordinary acceptation of the
term. Whether the other lady is a reality or only
a vision, or a portrait on a cigarette packet, or a
photo of Nellie Stewart, doesn’t appear ; the old
man says nothing, and merely wears a far-off ex-
pression in his eye and pays his board regularly.

Four members of the honorary medical
and surgical staff of Adelaide Hospital stood out
and prevented a return to work, although 12 mem-
bers wanted to go back.
In the early days
of Bathurst, N.S.W.,
writes a Bulletin
correspondent, poor
old (long since
retired in favor of
the next “oldest in-
habitant ”) used to
manage the collec-
tion at the local R.C.
services. Seated just
inside the entrance
door, the plate on his
knees, ’s short
prayer would accom-
pany the dropping
into it of each coin
as the faithful passed
in or out. These
prayers were of three
distinct sizes, and,
presumably, quali-
ties, adapted to the
respective values of
the* donations. To
the chink of the mod-
est “ sprat ” would
be heard the shaky
treble of : ‘ ‘ Bless
yer offerin’.” “ God
bless yer offerin’,” in
a slightly higher key,
would greet the de-
scent of a shilling,
while to the mad
rattle of a half-crown
a still higher and
more fervent ‘ ‘ May
God ’lmighty bless
yer offerin’ ! ” went
soaring aloft. Whe-
ther the increase in
the strength or size
of the prayer was oc-.
casioned by joy at the
capture of the larger amount, or whether
had in his mind s eye the parable concerning a
camel and the eye of a needle, I know not, but
certain it is that on all occasions the old man
rigidly adhered to his “scale.”

Sydney Sunday Times is a stupendous
failure as a mining tipster. But on the subject of
people who don’t wash themselves it is absolutely
solid. An extract
“ Now that we are commencing to perspire it is time to
ask, Do you take your morning bath ? ’ You may shru"
your shoulders and say that I am nobody to ask such a
question, but the truth is that many fashionable ladies—
those who clothe themselves in purple and fine linen—
have not the most elementary notion of cleanliness.
Their bodies are strangers to soap and water. In this
respect men are in advance of women. So long as the
face, neck, hands, and any other exposed portion o f ~c
body is clean, most of us are satisfied. It is for the same
reason that only a comparatively small trade is done in
underclothing. Now, dirt anywhere on the body is a
source of discomfort, and its presence demoralises. It is
impossible to believe that a high moral tone is compatible
with an unclean skm. A scrupulously clean person may
not possess good morals, but it is almost next to impossible
for a dirty person to be moral and pure. It seems in-
A LIKELY SURMISE.
S HE: “ You wretch! I believe your wife is too good for you.”
HE: “She is—she is a Christian Endeavorer.”
credible that in Sydney, with the dust and dirt of the
atmosphere settling on the skin and mingling with its
fatty secretion, any woman can live without bathing,
and that one can live under the same roof-tree
with a woman who is prejudiced against soap and water.
Nowadays even the richest and most idle women spend
less time in cleansing the skin than they spend in decor-
ating their bodies with finery, and they endeavor to buy
at so much a box that good complexion which Nature
would give them in return for the attention required to
keep the body healthy.”
“Most of us ” are satisfied! Evidently it is a
woman who writes, so she ought to know. Also,
the same lady, no end of a moralist, says :
“ I often think what a pity it is the French custom of
kissing the hand is not made the custom here ; it is sim-
ple, innocent, and even chivalrous. A kiss on the lips
should not last longer than a second.”

Officialdom in New Guinea is beginning to
bestir itself. It is now proposed to introduce a
form of civic marriage among the Papuans.
Wherein native marriages were a failure is not
clearly specified, but in future any parties so wish-
ing may be married formally in the presence of a
Govt, official. Also, any parties already married
may ratify their union in the same manner. Papua
is evidently on the Right Path. Already she has
learnt how to hang, and now marriage, divorce,
prostitution and disease are within reasonable dis-
tance. The farce of civilising a people who, in
the essentials of comfort and morality, were pro-
bably ahead of ourselves is simply unspeakable.

The famous Koo-wee-rup (Yic.) village
settlement has evidently got over its first diffi-
culties and is developing into a settledj.community.
At all events, the first Koo-wee-rup Settler to be
judicially flogged is to get his spell at the triangles
a week or two hence, and that seems to lend an air
of permanence to the place. When a new town-
ship has had its first flogging it is evidently get-
ting into line with the institutions of this great
country, so to speak, and has emerged into the*
light of civilisation. The cat and the gallows are
civilisation.
According to Meston’s report, the native
women in the Q. Peninsula are the prey of whites,
kanakas, and Chinamen, and everywhere a source
of discord. The old men of the coast tribes sell
their women to whites for flour and tobacco.
Meston goes so far as to say that if the girls at
Mapoon Mission were not guarded at night they
would be disposed of in the same manner. He
rebuts the charges of treachery made against the
blacks, and asserts that along the telegraph' line
natives have never interfered with a single official,
though they could easily have speared every man
in the service. The only remedy for existing
troubles lies in reservations and strict isolation.

Negotiations for a settlement of Adelaide
Hospital troubles lasted for four weeks without
result. Four of the ablest of the striking doctors
were willing to go back, but the Medical Uiiion
would not allow them to do so. Dr. Napier
agreed to give up all the wards but one in whic
he is a specialist—midwifery—but the Union
stipulated for a resignation of the lot. papier, by
the way, has incurred the enmity of Adelaide
doctors by working up a big private consulting
practice, and this constitutes portion of the milk
in the eoeoanut. The Ministry having failed to
settle the trouble, two more doctors are at once to
be imported if necessary.
The Tory members of S.A. Leg. Council-the
democrats withdrew from the ballot lately ap-
pointed a committee to enquire into Hospital
affairs. Of the five appointed two are doctors—
Campbell and Magarey—in close sympathy with
the local Medical Union, which passed resolutions
antagonistic to Napier and Smith, the imported
doctors, before their arrival, and has since consis-
tently boycotted them. As repeatedly stated
here, an impartial tribunal cannot be found m

You frequently refer to the poor salaries paid Sydney
and Melb. shorthand writers and typists. Do the Eastern
stenographers grumble at 305., 255., or 20s. a week ? Just

themselves to drift. Here, in holy Adelaide, I know of a

a minute— writes it, mind you—does all stenographic
work in connection with specifications, and types them as
well ! Another is employed in one of our “ best” solici-

these are first-class shorthand-writers and typists. Sala-

At a Sydney suburban police-court, one day
last week, a certain theft-case was called. “ Wm.

six miles— for medicine. He
got the medicine (a bottle
of three-star), and returned
hastily to the station. The
manager, now a well-known
man, was superintending
operations on the Chow. He
took the bottle, drew the
cork, sniffed. “Oh, damn

going to give good stuff
like that to a blanky Chow.”
And he didn’t.

found a means of extracting
fun from the wooden boxes,
containinggasineters, placed
at the foot of the street
lamp-posts in several Melb.
suburbs. Thus : A nail is
inserted in the meter, and,
as soon as the smell of gas
has become sufficiently pro-
nounced, the larrikin, whilst
sheltering himself behind
the lamp - post, inserts a
match, with the aid of a
stick, in the box, fragments
of which are scattered about
the street by the resultant
explosion. Who says that
the masses take no interest
in contemporary science ?

There are some polite
squatters out back. A Dar-
ling-shed shearer was rough-
ing his sheep. Next morning
he found a note over his
pen : “ Sheep rough; please
improve.” He sheared
cleaner next day and the following morning found
this note : “Improved. Thanks.” Fact.

A Texas (Q.) Bulletin correspondent:—
‘ A weird procession passed along this road a few
days ago. First a man, apparently much over 70,
his knees knocking together with weakness, lead-
ing an almost equally shaky horse bearing a few
rags of swap, &c. To the horse’s tail was attached
a piece of greenhide, at the end of which was a
perfectly blind old man. The first man was a
boko. They were making for the railway to try
and get to Sydney. ”
A Sydney suburban clergyman was visited
the other day by a scared man who wanted to be
married. The clergyman was willing, but his
client was ill at ease, and doubted the parson’s
ability to assist him. “ No, I don’t think you can
do it,” he said. “Why? What’s the matter?”
asked the parson, “Is the young woman agree-
able ? ” “ Oh, yes, she is anxious that you should
fix us up ; but I’m afraid you can’t do it for us.”
“Are you a married man?” “Yes, I am, and
that’s the trouble.” “ And is your wife living ? ”
“ Yes, of course.” “Then you can’t marry any-
one else.” “ Well, I don’t want to marry anyone
else.” “Why, then, did you come to me at all? ”
“The wife asked me.” “This is a most extra-
ordinary case.” “Well, you see, it’s like this : I
married her last week at a registrar’s, and
Lieutenant KLATING, N.A.V., the veteran
N.S.W. rifleman.
Kerry, photo.
she hasn’t had a wink of sleep since, thinking
the wedding was not all right and proper; she
wants to make sure and ease her mind, and we
thought as you could marry us over again.” “Oh !
if that’s all you want bring the wife here and I
will marry you again.” “And how much will it
cost ? I paid £1 already, and I’m out of work.
Will you fix us up for ss. ? ” “Well, if you can’t
afford to pay I’ll not make any charge.” And the
scared one hurried off and returned with his wife.
The parson met him a few days later and inquired
how she was. “Oh ! she’s quite peaceful now and
sleeps like a top. She’s too sleepy in the morning
to wake up and get my breakfast.”

of using 30oz. silver for loz. gold, silver might be the
dearer of the two; if it used loz. silver for loz. gold,
then silver might sell at ss. per ton. If Australia

Is, perhaps, the only thing that gives
more happiness to a woman’s heart
than an offer of an exceptionable bar-
gain. But this offer of a choice range
of Ladies’ Fashionable Silk and Satin

will probably give as much pleasure as
an offer of marriage. Capes at 10/11

Ex-Judge M‘Farland (admitted in 1847) is
the senior N.S.W. barrister. Justice Stephen
(1850) next, and Chief Justice Darley (1853) third.
John Wallis, reputed to be 98 years of
age, died suddenly at Penrith (N.S.W.) last week.
He fought at Waterloo —at least, like Geo. TV.,
he said so.
Chief Justice Darley ascended N.S.W.
Bench Nov., 1886. He had as colleagues Judges
Fawcett, Manning, Windeyer, and Innes ; three
of these are dead and the fourth on pension. Since
the Chief took his seat Stephen, Owen, Foster,
Deffell, C. J. Manning, Simpson, and Cohen have
been appointed. Of these, Foster is on pension,
and Deffell dead. Judge Darley, therefore, in
ten years has become the senior of the B nch.
Much quiet canvassing is being done by aspirants
for the Judgeship vacated by the death of Mr. Jus-
tice Innes. It is said that the Chief Justice has
reasons for desiring Attorney-General Want to
appoint himself to the vacancy, and that there are
many things less likely than “ Mr. Justice Want.”
The gentleman’s judicial attitude in the Crick case
guarantees his capacity.
Lieutenant M. J. Keating is the veteran
Australian rifleman ; he occupies the same relation
to Aus. rifle-shooting that W. G. Grace does to
English cricket. He began his consistent career
in 78 by winning an all-comers’ match in Sydney
at 900 and 1000yds. Since then, never a year has
passed without distinction for him in rifle matches.
He is the one man in Australia who has won the
Queen’s competition four times. This year he
won it by securing an aggregate of 370 against R.
Jeffery’s 368. He has made rifle-shooting a study
and a science; for instance, in ’95, in the Sydney
Rifle Assoc, members’ match, he began shooting
with a wind-gauge six feet to the left, and scored
34 out of a possible 35 at 500yds. Then the wind
changed round to a southerly “buster,” but
the veteran, altering his wind-gauge to 20ft.
to the right, put up another 34 out of 35
possible. He is also a dandy pistol-shot—just as
good as Hamilton, of Q., in fact; Keating’s best
is 35 out of 36 at 30yds. on a two-inch bull, Hamil-
ton’s 41 out of 42. Keating shoots very quickly ;
at Hobart in ’88 he scored 73 out of 75 with such
rapidity that his rifle-barrel was too hot to touch.
A friend, seeing him shoot in this way, as quick as
winking, ran up to remonstrate, but the marksman
replied only by rattling in 12 bull’s-eyes. Lieut.
Keating went to the Soudan with the Contingent,
and, on arriving in England, he was subjected to
an indignity which he deserved for being con-
cerned in such a business—the. Duke of Cambridge
laid his hand upon Keating’s shoulder, and mut-
tered something in a Dutch voice. Keating is aged
40 but feels 24.

A WOMAN’S LETTER.
~ _ v Sydney, Nov. 10, 1896.
Mr Dear Myee—
The new ladies’ club has taken unto itself pre*
raises in Phillip-street, and (of course) has called
itself the Victoria. Who was it that originally
said that all women were King-worshippers, Queen-
worshippers, and lord-worshippers? The club is
in form like unto a dwelling-house, most cosily
and prettily furnished, and is divided into three
parts—the residential club, the Salon, and the
restaurant. Residential members belong to all,
yet the Salonites will by no means be permitted
the privileges of the higher-priced clubites, and
the restaurant is for the use of all, as per terms.
And yet there are not three clubs, but one club]
The Athanasian difficulties of the rules yield to
study, and point to the future arising of cliques,
which will always be when women are gathered
together. On the ground-floor is a pretty tea-
room-the feminine of bar; upstairs there are
sitting-rooms and bedrooms. Culture will be im-
parted at weekly afternoon meetings and monthly
evening gatherings.
To reduce “calling” to a science the new club
will institute a sensible “ calling bureau,” or card-
clearing house. Visitors will deal out the paste-
board for each acquaintance who belongs to
the club, instead of spending whole days in de-
positing the same in different spots among the
distant suburbs. Then the favored ones will
return the compliment, and there will be at stated
times a general sorting-out. The telephone is in a
retired corner, and discreetly curtained off. All
the arrangements are made for the formal opening
next Thursday. Male associates will be welcomed,
but they must rely on intellectual delights only, as
there is no billiard-table, no smoking-room, and
no bar.
Six nights of “ Romeo and Juliet ” have filled
the Lyceum d.c. with all the folk not departed to
Melb. for the races. This is quite a record run for
the sentimental classic, and it has been helped
along by several theatre-parties. One on Thurs-
day night consisted of many cycling notables
assembled for the Carnival, and was given, along
with a dinner at the Australia, by a visiting
enthusiast from Melb. The play was perfectly
dressed and staged. Mrs. Potter has an instinct
for color and a genius for getting effects out of
garments. She acts with her clothes all the time.
When she threw her scarf to Romeo, after press-
ing it with loud, twanging kisses in the balcony,
an irreverent audience guffawed at the inartistic
salute ; a kiss audible over a whole theatre would
surely have given the lady away to the nurse in
the room behind. In the coaxing scene, she
charged at that garrulous old party with a long
red flag, bull-ring fashion, and pranced round her
in Burnes-Jonesey green-and-white. After being
repulsed by pa Capulet, who fulfilled stage tradi-
tions by wearing velvet boots and losing his
temper throughout the play, she glimmered like a
ghost in voluminous white until the end, when she
did a Svengali death-scene, face to the audience,
with Romeo underneath playing table.
Kyrle Bellew went the right way to get hugged
by making Romeo a handsome Italian boy in
vivid scarlet, and afterwards in sad-green. Mer-
cutio took his mortal stroke in russet-brown, a
favorite tint with Scot Inglis, and Cyril Keightley
spmewhat quenched the fire of Tybalt in a swag-
like garment; Denham, as the apothecary, was so
ragged that if one pin had given way, the whole
garment would have collapsed.
A curious crowd assembled one morning last
week near the Post-office to see two ladies start on
a bicycle tour to Melbourne. The start had been
previously announced, not for good faith, but as a
guarantee of publication. As an advertising
medium the bike still holds the world’s record.
The wheelwomen were clad in the new costume,
the skirt of which is built on the roller-blind prin-
ciple and jerks up and down with a Spring, thereby
enabling the rider to combine comfort with ele-
gance. But when they reach Yarra’s; gentle
stream they will find all the Melbourne inhabit-
ants too busy acquitting bank-directors to notice
even a new cut of knickers. There “ rationals ”
are as common as the women who wear them,
and have ceased to excite comment.
The liosehill Racing Club had two fine days for
the Birthday meeting on Saturday and Monday
last, and an encouraging attendance. The sec.’s
eloquent invitations to the “ fair sex ” to grace his
lawn have had due effect, for the gathering con-
tained many of the Nicest, more of the Next-to-
Nicest, and an unplaced majority hovering on the
outskirts of the blessed. Rosehill, sometimes
called the Caulfield of Sydney, beats the bleak
heath of the V.A.T.C. easily in beauty, and can
crow over Randwick in its traffic arrangements.
On Monday trains ran quickly and punctually. It
is a beautiful little course with a fascinating
glimpse of the river from the back of the stand.
I may whisper in confidence that there are two
cheval glasses in the ladies’ room and poudre de
riz on the dressing-table. So the toilet accessories
are all right. Wagering women were there in
great force, picking winners industriously, and
rejoicing, to the disgust of every one around them,
in the fall of Tim’s rider in the Steeple—which
was at first thought fatal—because they had
backed The Ace. They blatantly shouted con-
gratulations to each other while the ambulance-
cart was carrying off Mr. Gathorne Hardy, who
swelled the long list of Guvmentouse casualties—
not seriously, people will be glad to hear.
Lady Tichborne —you may know her by a hat
she is fond of wearing with a flamboyant pink
bow—was scrutinised on the lawn as she has been
all the week at the Australia. She has been much
worried, too, by interviewers dropping in at 3
a.m. to inquire all about her impressions of Cress-
well as the original of a man dead long before she
was born, until she finally declared herself “ not
at nome to callers and handed her companion as
a stop-gap to the tormentors. Lady T. was simply
dressed in a blue alpaca skirt and grass-lawn
blouse, and walked ungloved, which —if you have
nice diamond rings—is now the correct snap. She
was accompanied by an escort of two in decorative
telt hats and touristic suits of grey tweed. Three-
energetic young women wheeled themselves out
trom btrathfield in neat tailor-made habits. A
bank-manager’s wife in black and white was keep-
ing up her proverbial luck by winning sweeps all
da .y- howns, as a rule, were fresh and summery,
and showed a coming boom in green, a trying tint
for pale wearers.
Whenever there’s joy in the dailies over one
yellow-skinned sinner who is converted and bap-
tisedjt is always now recorded in the par. that
“interesting ceremony” was jubilated by a
Chinese choir. This points the fact, methinks,
that m the near future we shall be able to raise
locally all the celestial choirs we need. Enter-
prising theatrical managers have already begun to
aid the boom in Mongol melody ; there is an in-
digenous lay in the plot of the “Serpent’s Coil,”
now running at Her Majesty’s, sung by a real live
Chinaman in the land of Chow-puppies and baby-
towers.
Attractions round the Hampden track at the
League of Wheelmen Carnival on Saturday were
in the following order: —Three bars, two tea-
rooms, and one cycle store. There was a well-
filled Reserve, and many of the best-dressed
appeared in tony frocks. A pretty frock of the
artless type was of green muslin over white silk—a
lettuce salad _ effect. Tea was struggled for by a
thirsty public and an evidently overwhelmed
waiter unprepared for the demand.
A matrimonial boom is setting in strongly in
Sydney. Next month no less than six “ sassiety ”
weddings will set six well-known couples honey-
mooning.
The Society of Artists is holding its Inter-
provincial Art Union Exhibition in the Tem-
perance Hall, Pitt-st., enhanced by an evening
diversion called a “drawing-room entertainment.”
This consists of a man in tweeds abruptly darting
from behind the curtain and falling into the
“Barber of Seville ” overture, and another man
hastily choking down a voice-lozenge and begin-
ning a monologue. The pictures seem to enjoy it,
and there’s usually a fair sprinkling of the public
in the chairs laughing also.
When men dwelt in caves and ate raw bear,
they fed in private. The instinct still clings to
the Anglo-Saxon who prefers to chew apart from
his kind. If he eats a plate of oysters he does it
furtively behind a screen, and thinks it indecent
to drink tea save under cover. The prejudice
seems too stubborn to be overcome, or else open-
air cafes might be established in dozens of places.
For instance, what a site for a cafe near the Mac-
quarie-street entrance to Sydney Botanic
Gardens. A cafe-concert, I mean, all lit up at
night, with waiters rushing round with wine, lager-
bier, and sugar-water, and a girl singing raucously
to the band ! But if that is too daring a vision,
surely there is nothing wrong with having tea-
kiosks erected here and there in the gardens ?
Sydney parks are so badly kept that the very
word “ park ” sounds disreputable and conjures
up a vision of a dead-beat prone on the dusty grass
asleep amidst squashed figs, bushels of dead leaves,
orange-peel, and swirls of newspaper. What
their after-dark aspect is I don’t know, for no
respectable woman can venture into one' of the
enclosures after nightfall.
At the Samuell concert, at the Town Hall on
Saturday night, one of Sydney’s numerous infant
phenomena appeared—a youthful Pecliotsch, aged
uine—-and posed as the Australian Paginini, with
his little fiddle. The baby-genius is rife here.
Wherever one goes one hears a musical prodigy of
tender years thundering on the piano with the
vicious wrist-force of five-and-twenty in a suburban
drawing-room, or filing-down one’s nerves by
making the violin bow squeak like a pencil on a
slate. What is the ultimate end of all these suck-
ing St. Cecilias? Talent is abnormally developed
in some Sydney children. Unfortunately, it. gene-
rally takes the musical form. There are enough
talented juveniles now exercising their little digits
to keep up the supply of local genius well into the
next century. Gifted posterity will be, in fact,
crowded out if existing talent isn’t merely a sprint.
But these youngsters, somehow, haven’t any stay-
ing power ; they promise well, but don’t fulfil
prophecy of greatness. The infant prodigy, as a
prodigy, may be wondered at, but not enjoyed.
To play a “ piece” excellently is not the aim of
the musician ; musical expression is only valuable
as it shows the mind of the artist. Childish per-
formance expresses nothing at all.
Mrs. Hamilton, winner of Tattersall’s big
prize, .£13,500, on the Melb. Cup, is a shrewd and
careful Sydney suburban widow.
The latest Sydney vogue is for fat men to give
admiring girls a treat by cycling in knickerbockers
and slick silk stockings. One stout person bikes
regularly round the Block in pale grey, and there
are two of him so much alike in hat, face, figure,
and dress, that I look up to see if he has
“ Tweedledum ” or “ Tweedledee ” on his collar.
My Melb. correspondent writes :
“ The race-child was much in evidence at Flem-
ington on Cup-day. By child is not meant the
weird maiden who has tripped the land for the
last half-dozen seasons, always in the innocent
garb of childhood with guileless short skirts and
carefully dyed-and-frizzed hair, and broad ribbon
hat-strings tied under her sharp-looking, unyouth-
ful face, and who never seems to get any younger
or older, and who is indigenous to Melbourne only;
but the infant of five or six who is lugged about by
a .K a ily-attired mother, and who becomes tired out
and a nuisance before the day is half over. No
doubt, the fine weather on Tuesday last was the
cause of so many children being dragged out to
make stumbling-blocks on the lawn. A creche
should be provided for the race-child under the
grand-stand.
“A more brilliant sight than the Cup race with
Newhaven leading, and vast spaces of daylight
between him and the field, hasn’t been seen at
Flemington since Carbine’s year. Both of the
stands were crowded, and the lawn with its new
rose-gardened fencing looked like a huge bunch of
flowers. Never were chiffons so gorgeous and
variegated ; almost any gown there present would
have been regarded a few seasons ago as over-
gaudy for ball-wear. Even the sombre-looking
Govt. House set bloomed out into vivid blues and
pinks and violets. Lady Brassey’s pale grey had
a scintillating corselet of gold tissue. Lady Idina
B. was most festively attired in pale blue silk and
chiffon and lawn embroidery ; and Mrs. Freeman-
Thomas’s frock was simply a mass of filmy white
chiffon over silk. Most women carried parasols
of scarlet silk or some other shade equally vivid,
which helped out the brilliant tout ensemble nicely.
One lady annexed the whole rainbow in her gown,
laid on in broad stripes. She only needed a pen
and ink and a petition-form to suggest Cole’s
Book-arcade. Absolutely the best-dressed woman
out on Tuesday was one whose gaudy gamboge
tresses quite neutralised the effect of her exquisite
white crepe gown.
“ The belles of former years who have com-
mitted matrimony seemed to read a silent homily
against the alleged happy state. A few years of
double harness seem to take all the snap out of
the Melb. society girl. Some women, who, three
.or four Cups agone, made their names rattle like
a dog’s chain through all the screeds of the fashion
scribes by reason of their dash and chic, turned
out this season but sallow', dowdy ghosts of their
former selves. Other matrons guard against this
total annihilation of charms by perosided tresses
and complexions as fresh as paint can make them,
but in'"both cases the result is a bad advt. for
matrimony.
. Eacfcbf the gowns which the hostess of Clive-
den and the wife of the Chief Justice wore during
the meeting had done hard service during the
Sydney festivities. The latter’s prettiest gown—
white silk with cornflower fixings—was worn on
Cup-day, while the former sported her smartest
frock—white silk with a sort of inky pen-wiper
pattern in black on it—on Derby-day. Mrs.
Brough, who came out in the stewed-rhubarb silk
and Frenchy toque of Mrs. Ponderbury (Ist act),
brought Emma Temple in mannish blue cloth
with white collar and cuffs, and pretty Lily
Titheradge in.girlish white muslin. An imposing-
looking Sydney belle, in flower-besprinkled grass-
lawn over green silk, chaperoned a daintily-pretty
Melb. girl whose sister has been hoisted by an
Hinglish marriage into the ranks of the top-lofty,
and now regards her belongings from that proud
eminence.
“ Men’s fashions were as varied as the costumes
in a circus-ring. Melb. men never seem to have
made up their minds as to the correct garb for a
race-meeting. Even the Govt. House set seemed
divided between the vast encircling ‘frock’-coat
and silk fcat and the obsolete ‘ Beaufort ’ or sac
and ‘ boxer.’ The best-dressed men this season
let themselves go in the matter of neckties and
vests. Gorgeous tartan cravats tied French
fashion with loose flowing ends, and vests of gay
buff cloth, peppered over with blue or pink or
green spots, gave the ‘ smartest ’ a milliner-made,
even dolly appearance. Some sported waistcoats
of black brocaded cloth with spreading patterns
of palms and scrolls on them. Some Westralians
paraded the lawn in flannels with low-cut collars
and bold advts. for their own particular wild-cat,
iii, the shape of alleged nuggets dangling from
their watch-chains.
“ The sight of Cup-day was a tall, lanky, clean-
shaven, curly-locked individual, frock-coated and
billytoppered, who strutted the lawn, closely fol-
lowed by a diminutive nigger in livery, who care-
fully carried the lordly one’s field-glasses.
. “None but members of the Guvmentouse party
were seen within the Governor’s box at Fleming-
ton during the spring meeting—contrary to the
custom of Loch and Hopetoun, who used to issue
invitations to the charmed circle promiscuously.
Neither were any guests present at the vice-regal
luncheon, which fact is inexplicable, considering
that the stewards pay for the ki-ki.
“ The distinction seems to be, not to receive a
card of invitation for the race-week garden-party
at Govt. House. On Friday last the sacred lawns
of the vice-regal abode were trodden by the pro-
fane feet of scores, who spent the time in wonder-
ing how the others had got there. That each
person present was armed with a passport is
certain, for the gates were sternly guarded by
armed men, who demanded “Cards, please,” and
eyed each comer in a manner which would have
daunted any not shielded by a vast allotment of
pasteboard. This rather humiliating method of
admitting guests was instituted during the Loch
regime, and has been rigorously adhered to by
each succeeding Yic. Excellency, though the plan
is unknown in any of the other provinces.
“Lady Brassey, gowned in the cream silk and
pale blue and gold confection which became
familiar to Melb. folk during the ’95 festivities,
received the crowd on the upper lawn ; on the
lower a band poured forth “ Chinatown ” strains,
and afternoon-tea was struggled for ineffectually
in a rather limited marquee close at hand. Mrs.
Freeman Thomas wore her Derby dress of grass-
lawn over white silk and bore aloft a vivid green
’brolly. Lady Idina Brassey sported her Cup
gown of pale blue silk covered with tinted lace.
Many well-dressed women, including Lady Hamp-
den, favored sombre garbs of magpie-like black and
white. A good deal more grass-lawn was visible on
thebacks of the women present than under-foot, and
among the few who managed to wear this hack-
neyed fabric with any distinction were two who
had built their gowns on rosy-pink silk. The Hon.
Helen Brassey, in white embroidered muslin and a
flapping hat, was trotted round during the blanks
in the afternoon’s entertainment by pa, and under-
went much hugging and admiration from hordes
of gushful women. Young Freeman-Thomas, in
white piqu4, was also on view during the after-
noon.
“ Lady Brassey seems to have overcome her ob-
jection to watching the gee-gees throw their riders
and themselves in the steeplechase, and went out
with the Govt. House party to Flemington on
Saturday. Lady Hampden, however, did not
turn up, and missed thereby the most unpleasant
day of the whole meeting. Despite the cold,
showery weather the dressing, on the whole, was
very brilliant. Lady B. was in demure grey with
accordeon-pleated frills and narrow bands of black
velvet. The Brand girls wore white, the bon.
Alice breaking through the gloom which
had enshrouded the family lately by ap-
pearing in a highly colored green hat.
Lady Madden, in serpent-colored foulard with
dabs of white on it, brought her three daughters
all smartly enough attired to suggest vast raids on
the chief judicial salary. Lady Clarke, in b’ue
foulard, patterned with white, brought pretty
Miss Hilda Cumming, in a Bond-street gown of
grey silk, with trimmings of a strange new-pink
shade. One of the features of the afternoon was
a vast, comprehensive tea-party, whereat ‘ sas-
siety ’ endeavored to devour ice-cream and im-
mature strawberries with chattering teeth, while
the icy north wind froze the tea in the urns, and
the rain saturated the tablecloth.
“Sadie M‘Donald is not visiting the Vic. pro-
vinces with the Chinatown Co. She unfortunately
sprained her back while dancing, and is laid up in
a Melb. private hospital.
“Miss Alice Henry, a pen-woman whose level
head is associated with prematurely gray hair, has
started operations in Melbourne as a ‘ town-
shopper ’ and general undertaker of female com-
missions. Her business desire is to make herself
useful, on moderate terms, to far-away matrons.
She will buy their clothes for them, engage ser-
vants and governesses on their behalf, supply
information re dressmakers, attend auction-sales,
and, possibly, tend in the direction of furnishing
husbands for the girls, although the prospectus is
silent on this point. Also she will be prepared to
trot her clients around town, when they happen to
journey up from the interior, and give them
ocular demonstration of how bargains are picked
up. A lady of education and taste, alert to all
the wiles of the wicked draper, and blessed with
plenty of tact, Miss Henry is a type of New
Womanhood which has come to stay. Her office
and impressive door-plate are at No. 7 Queen’s
Walk, Melb.
“ Of her first commissions, it is said, one came
from Queensland for a white perambulator; another,
from Tocumwal, for a pulpit. ‘We have had an
extraordinary demand for perambulators of late,
Madam,’ said the head of one go-cart department
when the proxy alighted on his floor. ‘ What age
is your baby ? ’ The lady, who, like Marie Corelli,
is happily unmarried, went elsewhere for the baby-
brougham. The pulpit call dazed her most,
though. She finally got one at the Cathedral
Chapter House. ”
Y ours affectionately,
CLEO.

Gov. Brassey is quietly picking up plums
in Australian real property.
R. S. Smythe edited in the fifties the first
Australian picture paper —the Illustrated Post.
Melb. Trades Hall boss coterie now goes
in for top-hats and frock-coats. The “ frock-
coaterie,” in fact.
Dr. Alfreda Hilda Gamble, M. 8., 8.5.,
one of the resident surgeons of Melbourne Hos-
pital, is booked for matrimony by a leading Melb.
sawbones.
Crown Solicitor Stuart, S.A., lately re-
turned to work after an illness during which three
doctors gave him up. And the fourth one, who
prophesied a recovery, died himself.
Judge Boucaut (S.A.) has a horror of
murder cases, although he has tried but one (which
ended in the rope) during his 18-years judicial
career. Recently he exchanged sessions with
Way, C.J., and now the latter has to try the
Bessie Mann case in December.
Ex-M.L.A. John L. Dow loves to tell
how, when he lived at Edom, a little village not
far from Melbourne, he received from the post-
man a letter addressed, “Hon. J. L. Dow, Sodom.”
Across the address the jokeful Edomite postmaster
had written, “ Not known at Sodom. Try Go-
morrah.”
Vic. Acting-Agent-General Andrew Clarke
spent just 10 years in Victoria, and was all the
time in receipt of a rattling good State screw.
Pensioned in ’62, at £BOO a year, he has drawn to
date in pension cheques some £27,2- 0 of public
funds in return for doing nothing. He is a first
cousin of the late Marcus Clarke.
Apropos the fact that Purves, Q.C., lately
tried to quote the Lord’s Prayer in court but
boggled, trot out this one, for the benefit of the
generation which knows not Joseph. Bookie
No. 1 wagered that Bookie No. 2 didn’t know the
Lord’s Prayer. No. 2 began the Apostles’ Creed.
Whereupon No. 1 paid the wager.
Gov. Brassey has been touring the Vic.
Alps, and has been so much impressed by the
scenery that he has promised local residents to
“ write a panegyric ” about it. A Brassey pane-
gyric of scenery ! A dash of statistics, a chunk of
quotation, a bit about the Empyah and the navy,
and an allusion to Brassey’s contractor-father.
The death of Parkes removes the last of
the band of persons officially connected with the
trial and execution of the mad O’Farrell in 1868.,
Judge, hangman, barristers and solicitors—both
for prosecution and defence —are all gone. And
the Duke of Edinburgh, who was the one man
whose life was sought to be taken, survives, hale
and hearty.
Nothing m this life used to rile Judge
limes more than to say that he was grandson of
the celebrated Margaret Catchpole. As a matter
of fact, he wasn’t. On the Catchpole-Margaret-
Reibey question Mr. G. B. Barton, who lias lately
acquired curious documentary information from
England, will shortly have something very in-
teresting to say.
A Bulletin corres-
pondent : —One of the in-
formers in the Ayrshire
Downs case received £250
from Q. Govt. ; another,
bearing an Irish name, got
£5O and a passage to Eng-
land. The writer caught
a glimpse of the vouchers.
Herr Borchegrevink,
who is still compiling that
£15,000 he wants for Ant-
arctic exploration, married
in London last month, and
it is said he intends to take
the bride, if not the whole
way to the South Pole, at
any rate as far as Australia.
Borchegrevink is himself
an Australian of 18 years’
standing.
The father of the
drought-ruined S.A. farmer
Thyer (who lately mur-
dered his wife and five
children, afterwards suicid-
ing) was taken to the luna-
tic asylum the week after
the tragedy. He was once
a wealthy squatter, but the
advance of agricultural set-
tlement, together with dry
seasons, effectually ruined
him.
In N.S.W. Bar circles,
petticoats are generally un-
derstood to be at the bot-
tom of a recent judicial
breeze. There is always a
woman beneath the Bench,
tugging at His Honor’s
gown, and when both wo-
men get under the Bench
the squeal begins. In Mel-
bourne, the other day, Judge Hartley Williams
would have been Chief Justice had his wife not
offended the wife of a Minister of the Crown.
G. A. Lloyd, who obtained leave of absence
from N.S.W. Leg. Council last week on the score
of ill-health, was the first in N.S.W. to start the
regular business of buying gold-dust, as an inter-
mediary between miners and the banks.
The Bulletin hears on excellent authority
that the Premiers of the various Australias have
been asked by the Colonial Office to suggest the
names of eligible citizens to receive knighthood on
Jubilee Day (June 20, 1897).
N. : “ Fitchett’s Trafalgar is most excel-
lent as artistry. But what a contrast to his Sun-
day preaching ! According to this, the Trafalgar
killed would pretty well all go down to Sheol in
one shoot, but on Saturday, in an infidel paper,
he discriminates between the English sheep and
French goats. Must the man in the pulpit ever
wink the other eye?”
John E. Kelly, who died last week at Peak
Hill, lost £6OOO in attempting to run the aggres-
sively agnostic Stockwhip in Sydney some 20
years ago. When he was elected for the Bogan,
Parkes wrote to him, requesting a personal visit
as soon as he reached Sydney. A portfolio for
certain, friends whispered ; but when John called
Parkes merely showed him the autographs of three
or four kings and asked him to second the Address
in Reply.
Melbourne has been unlucky in
its Munros. There was “ Lady ”
Munro who used to make an unholy
spectacle of herself in the publio
streets. Also, Premier Jimmy Munro
and his Federal Bank clan, and
thirdly David Munro, the engineer,
of City of Melbourne Bank noto-
riety. What’s wrong with the name ?
A certain lately-retired Austra-
lian Judge was “often moved to tears.”
There was another Judge who was
often so moved, especially when there
was a woman in the case. The pre-
sent scribe has seen a brief drawn by
John Edwards, the younger, solicitor,
for G, P. Smith, counsel, in which this
paragraph was underscored “ Plain-
tiff will cry in the witness-box, and
Judge Pohlman will cry with her. See
that she doesn’t cry him into a verdict
for her. ” As a matter of fact plaintiff
did cry, Pohlman followed suit, and
almost stepped off the Bench to wipe
her eyes.
Archbishop Murphy, whose epis-
copal jubilee was celebrated at Hobart
the other day, with much pomp and
ceremony, was born on Waterloo Day.
Was in India, conducting missions at
Hyderabad, at the time of the Mutiny,
and armed his students for the purpose
of giving the mutineers a taste of
Donnybrook. But the students just
had to keep on spoiling for a fight.
Thirty years of Tasmania have left
the venerable cleric with one idea and
no hearing worth mentioning. The
one idea is to complete the cathedral,
the foundation-stone of which edifice
has been laid no less than seven times,
each laying resulting in additional con-
tributions from the faithful. Sydney’s
Cardinal performed the ceremony on
the present occasion, and another £lOOO
was planked down to gladden the heart of the
popular octogenarian.
H. H. Champion does not suffer from
excess of modesty. In a notice of “E. Nesbit’s ”
work in a recent issue of H.H.C’s paper, he
turns aside to supply this thrilling' item :
E. Nesbit is the wife of Herbert Bland, one of the
Fabian essayists, and a smart journalist whose character
sketch of the Editor of this paper can be seen at this
office-on payment of half-a-crown to the funds of the
Anti-Sweating League.
The man who thinks the populace is going to rush
along to read about his characteristics, “ on pay-
ment of half-a-crown,” has too much honest self-
esteem for the profession of letters —he should be
a society actor or a show musician.
“HIS CHRISTMAS BOX.”
MRS. SKINFLINT: “ Josiah, don’t you think the boy wants his hair
cut? ”
MR. SKINFLINT : “ How long is it till Christmas? ”
MRS. S. : “Six weeks.”
MR. S.: “ Let him wait till then, and Ell make him a Christmas-box
of a hair-cut! ”
There was lately discharged from Vic.
public service, on account of broken-down health,
a poor old woman who had done charing work at
Parliament House for 30 years. Speaker Berry
recommended that she receive a small gratuity
from the Government; but Premier Turner replied
with an emphatic “No!” and the unfortunate
creature, who is over 70 and a pauper, has to
go to an asylum like any other aged charing-
woman. When will old-age pensions for work-
people come along?
Hoo Ki, the Bowlahmine Chinaman, mar-
ried a Caucasian girl. When Hoo first saw his
son and heir he showed no emotion for some
seconds ; then turning to Mrs. Hoo Ki he ejacu-
lated : “ Lachel, you foolee me. Him baby
gotem led hair. I gotem black hair. You gotem
blown hair. Me know Mister Hooligan, policee-
man, gotem led hair. Me know—me setem cab-
bagee, come up cabbagee ; me setem lettucee,
come up lettucee ; setem Chinaman, come up
policeeman—no fear ! ”
Albert Edward of Wales is in sore trouble.
The son of the late Sir James Mackenzie claims a
million pounds which the latter is alleged to have
advanced to his royal friend, and Baron Hirsch’s
executors have made out a long bill for sundry
very large amounts lent by the Baron to Tummy
at various periods. Under these pressing circum-
stances, W. W. Astor is considered a not “un-
likely ” candidate for the hand of Princess Vic-
toria of W ales.

Premier Reid, in the matter of appoint-
ments to N.S.W. Supreme Court Bench, is nearly
as lucky as Parkes. In two years he has had
three vacancies at his disposal. If the present
vacancy is offered to the very best man available
in Australia —the man with most all-round ability
and who would do most to make the office re-
spected, Edmund Barton, Q.C., will have the first
refusal.
The N.S.W. District Court Judgeship,
vacant on the retirement of the veteran Judge
Forbes, is, so goes the story, to be conferred on a
comparative m-w-chum, who has, like a certain
well-advertised detective, the merit of being
“ loyal to the er —Crown Law Office.” A N.S.W.
District Court Judgeship is a most comfortable
post : =£lsoo a year salary, liberal travelling ex-
penses, and £750 a year pension.
It is said in Melbourne (where he has been
on a visit) that Sir Smith, the Westralian Excel-
lency, is as tired of W. A. as its people are of
him, and will return to England on an extended
leave before long. Smith is one of Joe Chamber-
lain’s friends. He dislikes Premier Forrest, who
returns the dislike with interest. Smith thinks a
heap of his dignity, but it is hard to be dignified
while bearing a name like Jerry Smith.
Journalist : “I only interviewed Von
Mueller once. He wanted me to smoke a blue-
gum cigar, over blue-gum tea. THe inveighed
against ‘ Dem naged statoots in de Bublic Gar-
denz, vid de nurz-girlz aboud, and de berambula-
dors.’ Like Queen Victoria, he thought in
German, wherefore his English got worse, if any-
thing. He showed me how he had planted the
present site of Government House with 1100 grand
young pine-trees as a ‘ Vorest for de loafers
(lovers) of de negxst generazion. ’”
“Jim” Carpenter, among Australian-born
cyclists, ranks as boss of the road. Twenty-six
years old, he didn’t start cycling until years
ago ; which comparative tardiness of beginning
results in comparative tardiness of sprinting.
For Carpenter, game as he is, can’t “ pick her up ”
quickly m a finish. But no man, so far, has been
able to camp on Carpenter’s tail in a road-race.
His first race was 36 miles on the road from Pen-
tridge out to Beveridge and back ; he won by
three miles. Last year in Melbourne he made
fastest time in every road-race run. This year
he excelled himself and beat everybody by plug-
ging from Warrnambool to Melbourne, 165 miles,
in Bhr. 40min. And while he is the most
enduring, he is also the most unlucky. He
scarcely ever rides a race without falling,
or without something breaking, or without
several things conspiring against him. He
was brought down in the recent 25-mile race in
Sydney through no fault of his own, and it would
be hard to say what rider’s chance at starting was
better than his ; but his worst streak of crazy-bad
luck was when he was winning the first prize (.£250)
in the last A.N.A. sports, and was downed on the
post by Hourigan stealing up unseen. Born of
Irish parents and a miller by vocation, he is one
of the best “doers” on this continent; he could
work hard all day long and maintain his condition
on corned beef. He is so strong within himself
that he has offered to race Bilmartin 200 miles on
the road for £2OO. He weighs close on list,
stripped, stands sft. 6in., measures just on 40in.
round the chest. His weakest part is his arms,
but when they have boxing-gloves on the ends of
them they are very serviceable indeed.
Judge Backhouse, ex-Justice Windeyer,
and Premier Reid all arrived in Sydney before
they were 12 months old.
The window of Jimmy Mirams’ stationery
shop at Collins-street, Melbourne, is very charac-
teristic of the little man behind the counter.
The stock on view includes Bibles for the regener-
ate few and whisky-flasks and packs of playing-
cards for the goats. As a teetotaller Jimmy sells
the flasks under protest, so to speak.
John Norton’s account of the narrow escape
of a Goulburn man, in a trial for treason-felony,
recalls a little-known incident in the life of Victor
Hugo. While an exile from Prance the poet took
refuge in the island of Jersey, but was expelled by
the States on refusing to drink the toast of the
Queen at a public banquet. This was the cause of
his going to Guernsey, where he lived for so many
years.
Judge Boucaut, of S.A. (an ex-Premier of
the province), was 05 on October 29. He breeds
horses for India, while Way, C.J., devotes his
leisure to sheep. It has been suggested that if a
man were smart enough to steal steeds from
Boucaut, jum bucks from Way, and fowls from
Bundey he would so cripple S.A. Supreme Court
bench in respect to his trial as to ensure getting
off scot-free.
The late Baron von Mueller was absent-
minded, as savants often are. When a guest one
warm night at a Toorak dance, he was missing
awhile from the festive scene, but was afterwards
found by the hostess in the ball-room. During his
absence he had by some means exchanged the
crush hat with which he had been fanning himself
all the evening for an oval-shaped piece of wood
with a knob in the centre of it.
S.A. Premier Kingston’s greatest enemies
are perhaps the religious cranks. Anonymous
letters in the Tory papers comparing the Premier
with Ananias are of daily occurrence, and occa-
sionally the menu is varied by subtle references to
Jeremiah, and Pontius Pilate, and Judas Iscariot,
and other old Bible cranks; but recently some-
body wrote warning Kingston of the fate of
Rehoboam. After examining the subject all
round, the S.A. Premier feels rather compli-
mented, for although Rehoboam, like Kingston,
got into a warm corner on occasions, he reigned
over Jerusalem for 22 years, and Kingston reckons
if he can last that long he will have a big chance
of settling the Adelaide hospital difficulty.
Mr. C. H. Kerry, the N.S.W. pigeon-snot,
who won the much-contested Hordern Shield, is a
true son of Australia, and a thorough sportsman.
Kerry , photo.
Mr. G. H. KERRY, winner of the Hordern
100 guineas pigeon-shooting trophy.
He has tramped after game on plain and moun-
tain, shot and retrieved numberless waterfowl on
lake and river ; shot by moon, by stars, by ear.
He has bored his way into coastal scrubs and
filled his bag with pigeons and himself with ticks ;
has wriggled on his stomach a half-mile by night
over clay pans for nothing, because the whistlers
sighted him first. Also on occasions he has
emptied both barfels and two more into said
whistlers, and come home laden with ducks and
mud. He is an enthusiastic horseman, and
learned to ride in his birth-place, at Snowy River,
the break-neck district. Kerry learnt to shoot
by getting himself shot; at the age of nine, he
“ sneaked ” a curiosity which his elder brother had
bought for £1; he loaded it with powder and
shot in the delusion that it was a gun. Then in
the presence of several covetous mates he pulled
the spring upon a neighbour’s rooster. However,
he continued to live.


Tt is feared that the clause introduced into the
Factories Act permitting Jews to transact business
on Sundays may offer temptation to unscrupulous
men to declare themselves Jews. But think of the

LONDON*, Friday Night.—Mr. Frank Far-
poll, M.P., of New South Wales, in the course
of an interview published to-day, states that
in a few years Australia will ask for inde-
pendence.
Mr. Farnell added that on his return to

POLITICAL
POINTS
In N.S.W. Parliament, the President of
the Council and Speaker of the Assembly are
both natives and Protectionists.
Since '62, N.S. Wales has spent in round
numbers half a million sterling on exhibitions.
This allows for the receipts from the Garden
Palace Exhibition.
Sixty-three years ago N.S.W. abolished
capital punishment for cattle-stealing, forgery and
theft. Tell us—what evil consequences ensued ?
John Haynes’s motion for the utter abolition of
hanging is merely late in the day.
Three Australasian Premiers—Turner,
Kingston, and Seddon—are steadily killing them-
selves with hard work. In each case there are
only two, or at most three, really hard workers in
the Cabinet, and these carry the whole weight of
the Government.
Coolgardie is sure that it would have got
the Menzies railway but for some sinister influence
which moved the Govt, to change its mind. Local
opinion sets down the loss of the line to the Separa-
tion cry, or to the pilling of a certain politician at
the Coolgardie Club.
Seventy truant-children cases were brought
before Richmond (Melb.) Court, and the excuse in
43 cases was “ no clothes ” or “no boots.” Apropos,
Victorian truant-inspectors make their billet an
easy one by only looking up the truants on the
school-roll, the gutter class not being interfered
with.
Be the interruptions and amendments of
the Socialists and other democrats at such affairs
as the Melb. Trafalgar meeting, the local “great
dailies ” are trying on the “ conspiracy of silence ”
so well served its purpose in the case of
Jos. Symes. But it won’t work so well on all
occasions, as the big newspapers will find to their
cost one day.
Queensland Govt, is about to encourage
the immigration of people from Germany and
Southern Europe. As far as the Australian is
concerned, the cheap Latin is as deadly as the
Chow and the Jap. Between Chows, Germans,
Greeks, Kanakas, Hindoos, Italians, Japs., and
Malays, Queenslanders will be a lovely mixture
next century.
The Electoral Bill, now before S.A. As-
sembly, abolishes the Absent Voters Act, origin-
ally passed for the benefit of workers, particularly
seamen, absent on duty on polling-dav. Although
largely availed of by the latter, the system was so
successfully made the means of Tory abuse and
roll-manipulation that a large Assembly majority
demands its abolition.
THE IRONY OF FATE.
(A sketch in George - street, Sydney.)
Had not N.S.W. Speaker Abbott taken
back his decision preventing Premier Reid’s reply
to Opposition leader Lyne’s personalities in the
discussion on land-valuers the other night, it was
determined to move in dissent. This would have
meant that either Reid or Abbott should go, and
would, to all intents and purposes, have been
treated as a crisis. Prophets say “Joe” will
some night decline to “ take it back.”
The closure which now has Tasmania by
the ears was introduced into Australian politics
by M'Culloch in Victoria in 187fi. The “ Gag ”or
“Iron Hand,” wherever introduced since, has
been supposed to need local Parliamentary
authority, Tasmania alone depending on the
authority of the British Parliament.
Had Copeland introduced a Bill simply to
throw open N.S. W. public-houses during certain
hours on Sundays, he would have carried his
measure without difficulty, but by mixing un
Good Friday, Christmas Day, and public and
private clubs with the prime question, he makes
liis Bill vulnerable by, at all events, the genius of
delay.
N.S. W. Referendum Bill was thrown out
of the Leg. Council by 30 votes against 9. Th e
Reid Government, only a few months ago, sen**
what it considered as 10 reliable supporters
to the Council, in addition to those already
there, yet on this essential measure it only mus-
tered nine votes. The democratising of a House
of irresponsible nominees is a hopeless under-
taking.
What animates the current craze to build
palatial Houses of Parliament somewhere about
Sydney is the fact that .£lOO,OOO has been already
voted as a first contribution for the purpose. That
vote was taken at a rollicking, plentiful period and
when Federation loomed dim. Some member
should test the sense of Parliament to-day by
moving to rescind that vote. Otherwise’ the
Premier may begin the plunge.
Ass-President Moulden (S.A.), when in
Sydney the other day, sneered at S.A. Labor poli-
ticians, “ who could not earn £4 a week except in
Parliament.” His predecessor in the presidency
of the League has just assigned his estate, which
is pot expected to pay more than 9d. in the £. The
leader of S.A. Opposition (now a member of the
League) publicly confessed, some time ago, that he
could not afford to be in Parliament if it were not
for payment of members ; and more than one
member voting the same ticket is notoriously in a
similar position. So that Solicitor Moulden, who
once posed as a Liberal himself, and who was
Attorney-General for awhile under Dr. Cockburn,
is wielding a two-edged sword.
It is a good thing for a Ministry to be per-
sistently boosted by the metropolitan press. Ex-
Premier Dibbs became known as the boss blunderer
of Australia; yet Dibbs was a diplomatic and
tactful person compared with Reid, only the city
press persistently called him a blunderer till the
name “ caught on.” Reid’s whole career has been
a persistent falling over his own large, awkward
feet, still the public hasn’t yet begun to realise
that Jollyandfat is the most astounding blunderer
who has held office in recent years. Consider a
few of his Government’s performances : The pro-
duction of that bogus list of Dibbs’s civil service
appointments; the bogus list of Victorian prices
(both of these documents had to Ve withdrawn
and apologised for) ; the arrest of Crick on no
shadow of evidence; the capsize of Reid’s first
surplus by the State Auditor, who showed it to
have been manufactured by taking credit for
amounts which belonged to previous years ; the
capsize by the State Auditor in the same report of
the well-worn yarn about the Dibbs deficit, which
proved to be partly manufactured by Reid ; the
back-down re the promise to establish a State note
issue ; the Land-tax muddle. G. H. Reid’s is the
Great Muddle Minis* of Australia.
The 30 Leg. Coun-
cillors who snortingly
spurned the first reading of
N.S.W._ Referendum Bill
have given the spouting
section of the Government
and Labor-party the very
occasion for offence which
serves their purpose. It
was probably in hopes of
this that the Bill was held
till the eve of breaking-up.
Under the N.S. Wales
Public Health Bill every
municipality is' to (1) pro-
vide isolated accommodation
and attendance for every
family in which an infec-
tious disease may appear;
(2) compensate owners for
infected bedding and other
property destroyed ; (3) es-
tablish a place and appa-
ratus for proper disinfec-
tion ; (4) make a reasonable
allowance to tenants for cost
of removing their goods from
a condemned habitation ;
(5) provide a medical officer
to enforce the Act. In the
present state of things this
means 41 quarantine stations
and disinfectingstationsand
disinfecting apparatus and
salaried medical officers for
a district all within sight of
SydneyP.O. tower. Another
good reason for hurrying up
municipal federation in and
around Sydney.
The Seddon (M.L.) Government goes to
the country with a programme which includes the
Old Age Pension scheme, State fire-insurance re
form of the Local Government system which’has
grown too large and cumbrous, the acquisition on
a larger scale than heretofore of bio- estates and
the establishment of workmen’s villa°-es on the
outskirts of cities. This straight and definite
programme contrasts strongly with the Tory
party’s hazy maunderings about promoting “ free-
clom of enterprise ” and similar hunks of lofty
moral fog.
Auc kland (M.L.) has started a frantically
J in ?° Navy League, which hoisted flags and
delivered ungrammatical speeches and otherwise
S ed 011 , the anniversary of Trafal-
gar. Yet if the I rench residents, who are pretty
numerous, began letting off fireworks to celebrate
the anniversaries of Steinkirk and Neer winden and
1?®“ the ? the
® the Britisher, or the casual Spaniard
hoisted a big banner over his fruit-shop to cele-
hrate his capture of one British army at Brihuega
and another at Buenos Ayres, the Navy League
would probably say that it was beastly ungentle-
manly and ought to be put down. 'And what,
would happen to a IMaori if he proceshed in Auck-
land to commemorate the six or eight occasions on
lives’ * ie ma<^e tbe crowdrun f° r their
St. Just: “ Youth is, above all, needed in
Australian politics. Take the junior member of
Yic. Parliament, Cook, sent in brand-new, and
observe that he does just as well as almost anyone.
Impulse only comes from the young. Thus all
remarked on the glorious youth which character-
ised the Parliament that ushered in the French
Revolution. The Old Man of the Sea is the so-
called mature politician, who, like the cunning old
soldier, won’t fight. The go-ahead Turner
Cabinet is the youngest ever known.”
AUSTRALIAN DIGNITY.
THE SMALL BOY (to big bookmaker) : “ What price
Newhaven? ”
BOOKIE: “ I don't bet with little boys.”
THE CHERUB: “ You don't; then , you-I will
you fight?”
Melb. Argus quotes with enthusiasm the
sneer of a globe-trotting Frenchman, M. Leroy-
Beaulieu —“ The Australian colonies seem to be-
lieve that they have a mission to lead the world in
the path of progress.” The French gentleman
didn't get his notions of national sentiment from
the Argus, anyhow. Nobody has ever accused
that lamentable journal of wishing to bustle man-
kind along the path of progress.
Alfred Saunders, “Father” of the M.L.
House of Representatives (brother to A. E. Saun-
ders, the Walworth, Eng., M.P.) was born June
12, 1820, landed in Nelson (M.L.) in ’42—“ one of
the first.” In ’55, sat in Prov. Council, and
was J.P’d in ’5B ; the following year, for slating
Judge Travers in the Examiner, he was “sent
up ’’ for six months, fined ,£l5O, and struck off the
magisterial roll. He was reinstated instanter on
petition, and from gaol was again transferred
to the Prov. Council, having been elected thereto
whilst still in durance. Then they sent him up
as M.H.R., where he declined the Col. Treasurer-
A. SAUNDERS, Father of M.L. Parliament.
Wrigglesworth & Binns, photo
ship under Wm. Fox; he was twice elected
Superintendent of Nelson province, resigning in
fi/, and it was during his term that the murderous
Maungatapu quartet gang (Burgess, Kelly, Levy,
and Sullivan) were captured. After a long trip to
England, he settled in Canterbury, where in ’77
J'® was M.H.R d for Cheviot, and yet again in
7J. In ’BO he was chairman of that drastic body
of reformers, the Civil Service Commission. Lin-
coln took him to herself in ’B9—and to that seat
he has since stuck As a writer, “ Our Domestic
.Birds ( 83) and Our Horses ” claim his father-
ship. 1,8 said Seddon offered the Treasurership
to Saunders on Ward’s resignation, but the
I ather of the House declined.
There is a half-penny postage on news-
papers iii Freetrade England and a half-penny
postage in Protectionist Victoria. And N.S.
Wales will have a similar postage when it get's a
straight-going Government, able to look the morn-
ing press in the face.
When that circumnavigating Yankee skip*
per called in at Brisbane the other day, local
quidnuncs wanted to know why he had paid
Bananaland a visit. The Yankee averred he had
been informed Queensland was the only country
without a public debt, and he had called to see a
land so interesting. Considering that the Q. debt
averages about £69 per head of the population, the
Yankee’s remark savours somewhat of sarcasm.
Melbourne Conservatives are very angry
indeed with young Tom Brassey for delivering a
lecture in which he says that Socialists are not the
fiendish folk they have been represented to be, but
are on the contrary, the apostles of a desirable
mode of social evolution. The address was “mis-
chievous,” the Argus says. The anger of the
Tory rump is all the more furious because the
young man spoke with the Government House
aureole round his head. They see. in awful visions,
a red flag flying from the white tower on the south
bank of the Yarra, with a cap of Liberty sur-
mounting the flagstaff.
A Bulletin correspondent:—
At Albany (W.A.) “ forts ” —one of the leading defences
of Australia from the Russian invader —there are 26
officers, non- com missioned officers, and
men, including two engineers attached
from other corps. These 26 are sup-
posed to man and work six 3in.
breech - loading guns on barbette
mountings, two nine-pounder muzzle-
loading field-guns, two Maxim guns,
and two Hotchkiss sixpounders. (The
Hotchkiss guns are not mounted).
The men are supplied with carbines
in use since 1879 seventeen
years; and the forts are laid
out not, apparently, to protect
men working at the guns, but
as slaughter-pits. One gun is
on an elevation 370 ft. above sea-
level ; and above the level of the
gun, and not 20ft. from it, are
huge granite rocks. If a single
common shell struck there the gun-
ners would be taken away in frag-
ments. Another gun is fully 100
yards from the magazine, and in
bringing ammunition to it the men
would be exposed to open fire from
the enemy. It is easy to see from
this how adequately Albany forts
are maintained (vide Major-
General Hutton at a meeting of
the Federal Defence Commit-
tee at ’Orae).
Aid. Fuller, M.L.C.,
is being- brought out by
the National Ass to run
against Tucker for the Ade-
laide civic chair. The election
is on Dec. 1, and the light will be
close, as many Tories have a vote in each six
wards. A bill to abolish plurality of votes for
mayor, aldermen and auditors is now before Par-
liament, but it is sure to be rejected by the Leg.
Council.
The land-grantrailway syndicates now per-
vading Tasmania don’t ask for so very much
after all. There are two which want to build a
railway to the west coast. One—a Melbourne
affair—will condescend to build and own the line
if it gets the necessary land gratis and receives a
grant of about 960,000 acres in addition. The
English syndicate wants the land gratis, a grant
of 288,000 acres, and the province to permanently
guarantee 2 per cent, interest on the cost of con-
struction, equal to £20,000 a year. They don’t
ask anything more than this ! The syndicate is a
modest and retiring affair and easily satisfied.
Sydney Evening News fills a leading
article with lofty scorn because some N.S.W. Pro-
tectionist politicians sent a cable of congratula-
tion to M'Kinley, the coming U.S. President. It
was a somewhat asinine act, certainly, but con-
sidering the placid approval of the Noose when
a similar crowd of Freetraders cabled their con-
gratulations to Cleveland (who hadn’t the civility
to reply) on an exactly similar occasion, the
News would seem to have a bad memory or
to suffer from a very bad attack of hypocrisy.
Moreover, the Protectionist politicians didn’t
make themselves ridiculous by calling a publio
meeting over the matter as the Noose crowd did.
A Celebrated Novelist.
Captain Lacie, the celebrated Australian writer,
and author of “ Tales of Outlaws,” “ Narratives of
the Bushranging Times,” “ Convict Records and
Chronicles in Van Dieman’s Land and Norfolk
Island,” “The Gem Finders,” &c., &c., is a born
traveller. He has explored most parts of Aus-
tralasia and visited nearly all foreign countries.
Most of his writings are well-known in the colonies,
and the following, in his usual concise, graphic
style, will interest our readers : “In preparing my
series of ‘ Bushranging Narratives ’ and ‘ Tales
of Outlaws,’ I underwent great physical hardships
in order that I might describe from personal ob-
servation the chief haunts of noted desperadoes of
the past. This was particularly so on the wild,
and at that time practically unexplored, west
coast of Tasmania, round the Macquarie Harbour
district; in the frightful glens sacred to the ‘ bauri
vine,’ and the tremendous ranges around the
Frenchman’s Cap and Cradle Mountain, I endured
great exposure, which debilitated and ran down
my system. Sleeping in wet clothes in the bush,
with unsuitable and uncertain food, brought on
severe kidney and liver troubles, tending to chronic
rheumatism. Having had former beneficial ex-
perience of the effects of Warner’s ‘ Safe ’ Cure, I
took a course of that medicine for a few months,
and I am pleased to say it has entirely restored
me to my former robust health. ”

An outlay of £30,000 on additions and
alterations to Menzies’ Hotel has brought that
venerable hostelry more than up to date. The
building is now as big as its reputation, and the
beauty of the interior will be a joy for ever to
some of Menzies’ oldest adherents, whose souls are
generally understood to go there when they die.
It is the squatters’ heaven, the globe-trotters’
delight. A winter garden attached to the Moorish
hall, where small parties may feed alfresco during
the summer months, is a notable new feature.
Phil Goatcher, the scenic artist, was engaged to
re-decorate the main hall, and the ceiling is a
dream of fair nymphs tempting the general public
to walk right in and buy a drink at the bar. Good
liquor and good management have been the secrets
of Menzies’ success. The old place stood still and
said nothing whilst vast coffee palaces were spring-
ing up to the glory of temperance principles, but
to-day the palaces bewail their awful failure with
a loud, snuffling voice, and the hotel is going
ahead as though boom-time had returned.

Some big druggists have lately suffered
from a novelty in sneak-thieving. A well-dressed
man calls on a leading doctor and asks for his
card as “a patient wishes to write to him from
,” an adjoining town or suburb. The card
is then presented at a neighboring druggist’s a
little before the time of changing assistants, and
a couple of syphons of mineral water got on the
strength thereof. An hour later, when the new
assistant is behind the counter, the syphons are
returned empty, and the usual deposit thereon is
handed over by the unsuspecting counter-hand
when asked for. As no deposit was paid at first,
this is all “ bunce.”

But few of noted specialists have sprung into pre-
eminence and an immense practice as Surgeon Langston,
a resident and practitioner at 121 Collins-street, Mel-
bourne. His name has become almost literally a house-
hold word ; almost every other man you meet has a
wonderful story to relate of some almost miraculous cure
he has performed in an acute or chronic case of long
standing, where other physicians have failed. He ad-
dresses himself in particular to cases that have baffled the
skill and science of other doctors. His name is a suffi-
cient guarantee of a perfect cure of every case he unde-
takes. Consult him this day. It may save you mr
mental and physical suffering, and add golden years
your life.
YOUNG MEN.

friend and benefactor. If you are troubled with weaken-
ing dreams, unrefreshing sleep, a tired gloomy feeling, and
loss of energy, ambition and self-confidence, which im-
pair both your body and brain, and absolutely unfit you
for study, business, or the proper enjoyment of married or
single life; if you are suffering from these or similar symp-
toms you know the cause. Do not allow false pride and
sham modesty to deter you in seeking relief. Before it is
everlastingly too late, consult this reliable old specialist,
who thoroughly understands your trouble, and can treat
it with unfailing success.
MIDDLE AGED MEN.
There are many of you afflicted with weak, aching
back and kidneys, loss of mental and physical power and
vigour, wasting weakness, and not unfrequently accom-
panied by an impairment of the general health. In justice
to this celebrated specialist it can be truthfully stated that
in all such cases of middle aged men, as well as of youn/
men, his success has been almost invariable.

SPORTING NOTIONS.
There can be no question as to the inferior
quality of the older horses running in this year’s Cup.
Season after season the best three-year-old form is shown,
with rare exceptions, in the V.R.C. Derby, and these
Derby horses, as a rule, represent “ class ” thereafter.
Take the notable Derby horses of 1893, ’94, ’9s—who would
now be the representative four, five, and six-year-olds, if
they were racing. Carnage, Sailor Prince, Pounamu,
Patron, The Harvester, Malachite, Bonnie Scotland, Wal-
lace, Osculator, Auraria, and Waterfall. Where are they
now? Not one of them ran in the Cup. The Cup fields
this year and last were remarkable for not including one
classic performer of note, and the result was the same in
both cases. Two out of the four placed horses were
youngsters, finishing first and fourth respectively on
either occasion—Auraria and Waterfall, Newhaven and
Resolute.
* * * *
The Y.R.C. stewards must be feeling rather
sore re their enquiry into the running of Broken Hill on
Derby Day. Mr. David James’ horse ran nowhere in the
Hotham Handicap, likewise The Skipper. Three days
later The Skipper shows vastly improved form in Mel-
bourne Cup, whereas Broken Hill runs just as moderately
as before. David James may well complain that the local
authorities ought to spare some of their suspicions for the
running of local horses. There was at least one glaringly
apparent stiff-’un started for the Yan Yean Stakes on Cup
Day. Why didn’t the stewards hold an enquiry into that
case ?
* * * *
Another sample of the stuff that newspapers give
to punters nowaday's. From Melb. Herald : —“ The
wagering on the Melbourne Cup was very brisk this after-
noon when the card was called at the Victorian Club.
Preston was supported to win £5OO at 100 to 2, but subse-
quently 100 to I t was offered without finding takers,” &c.,
&e. An inch of betting-market news is devoted to the
exciting fact that somebody put a “ tenner” on Preston,
after which Ikey Mo made an abortive attempt to get a
further 30 “ bob ” out of the horse’s dashing admirer !
Should Hopscotch not be sent to Hingland, we
shall have him carrying the coin of fly-flat punters in next
Melbourne Cup. Experience teaches nothing to such
Machiavellians. They talked in dark mysterious whispers
of the “cunning crowd” associated with Long’s cham-
pion, as though “Bill Long” and “ Jimmy Hayes” were
Hopscotch, and the four legs of the owner and jockey
were capable of winning in a canter whenever “the
money was on.” In short, they reckoned without the
’orse, who has always performed in big handicaps like a
thoroughly honest non-stayer.
* ♦ » »
When the vice-regal lady happens to be a New
Woman, she will undoubtedly agitate to be emancipated
from the senseless task of placing a blue ribbon round the
neck of the winner of a horserace. It is not an edifying
spectacle to see a five-foot woman trying to lasso an un-
ruly six-foot quadruped ; in terror, all the time, of having
her dress damaged, her gloves dirtied, and her feet
trodden upon by the playful beast, which doesn’t appre-
ciate the honor, and only wants to lash out among
the crowd. The owner wants to get his horse away to
be rubbed down, and the crowd don’t care, and the
operator doesn’t like the job, so it’s about time such fool-
ishness was abolished.
* * » *
A handsome male animal down on his luck
always appeals to the sympathy' of lovely woman. After
the Cup, whilst Resolute was being rubbed down by a
couple of stable hands, and nobody else was troubling
about him, Miss Wilson came along to cuddle his head
and commend the poor dear old boy for having done his
best under the circumstances.
» * * »
On Wednesday before Vic. Derby Day a cor-
poration laborer dropped down dead in the street from
sunstroke, and on the Friday and Saturday following the
shopkeepers couldn’t find overcoats and waterproofs
enough to supply the demand.
* * * *
The luck of N.S.W. investors in Adams’ Melb.
Cup consultations this year has been remarkable. There
were 5 sweeps, the first prize in every instance going to
N.S.W. Out of a total of 15 “big money” prizes (i.e.,
Ist, 2nd, and 3rd horses) 8 went to N.S.W ; 3 to Vic. ; 2 to
W.A ;1 to Tas ; 2to Maoriland. Queensland and S. Aus.
apparently “ weren’t having any” this time.
* * * »
Rumored that Tas. Govt, intends, after the end
of the year, to enact that local applications for Adams’
tickets must be made through the Post Office. If true,
this is snaring revenue with a vengeance.
* * * *
Newhaven’s most enthusiastic worshippers,
previous to the Derb.v and Cup, were N.S.W. visitors who
saw him win his races at Randwick, but missed seeing
him get beaten in the Caulfield Guineas. The chestnut
colt had not so deeply impressed the Victorians. His
half-head victory over Excel, with Nada close up, and his
easy defeat by Officer, were what the local race-goers had
seen, so it was not until Newhaven ran away with the
Derby that they could regard him with awe. Then they
fancied him for the Cup, if they were reasonable mortals,
and took Resolute (meeting him at an advantage of 151 b.)
to be his most dangerous opponent. The books, how-
ever, fielded strongly against Resolute on account of the
big fellow’s shockingly bad feet, which, by the way, are
not likely to stand much more ’ammer, ’ammer, ’ammer
on the ’ard ’igh road to distinction.
* * * *
Newhaven better than Carbine, is he? Wait
until he has given, as Carbine did, 531 b. and a four-lengths
beating to another Highborn, a horse that subsequently
won the Sydney and Australian Cups, carrying more than
9st. each time.
* * * *
The effect of Newhaven’s popular Derby and
Cup wins was visible in the big attendance at Flemington
on Oaks day. Although the weather was not specially
inviting, grand-stand receipts were higher than for two or
three previous years.
Thunder Queen for the Oaks, and Hopscotch
for the Flying Stakes, were two of the best things “ on
paper ” at the V.R.C. meeting, nevertheless, the “ books ”
fie.ded against both as though they thought they knew
something. Results proved that Ikey, for once, knew
nothing.
Last year Hopscotch was beaten at the finish of
the Flying Stakes by' Hova, Wallace, and Mostyn. The
cattle that met Hopscotch on Thursday didn’t include
any sturdy fliers of the Hova and Wallace class, and going
away with the lead, exactly as he did last year, the big
chestnut was able to keep it to the end.
Thunder Queen’s gallop in the Oaks was ljsec.
faster than the previous record, and sJsec. faster than
Auraria’s time.
The performances of Bloodshot and O’Trigger at
Flemington explain why The Bulletin had a good deal to
say about these stable companions before they had
started to distinguish themselves.
Nada broke down in the Melb. Cup race and
may' not run again.
Chris. Moore’s finish on Hymettus, in the two-
year-old race won by Hypnotist, was just what is expected
from a jockey' who is getting home comfortably' with
about a stone in hand. Whilst Holmes, on Hypnotist, was
riding vigorously, Moore sat upright on the other horse,
although he was only half a length, or so, behind. There
seem to be two versions of the explanation which Moore
gave to the V.R.C. stewards, who accepted it as satisfac-
tory. According to one version, the jockey thought he
was winning, and therefore didn’t bestir himself. The
other story states that he didn’t think Hymettus would
make another effort if called upon.
* * * *
The most “ tony ” dog-cart, at Flemington
races, held three Chinamen, with a European groom.
* * * *
The C. B. Fisher Plate, in the V.R.C. meeting,
just over, was a reminder of a great sportsman, now on
his financial beam-ends, and a worthy commencement has
been made with a subscription—Mr. Falkiner heads the
list with £5OO. There never was such a big dive made on
the Victorian turf as with the Maribyrnongstables, which,
however, were more the work of Hurtle Fisher than C.B.
The wiser, but not wise enough, C.B. altered the stock
from racers into Merinos, Shorthorns, and Clydesdales.
* * * »
The Amiable managers were “sent up” for a
year at Rosehill on Saturday, over the mare’s barefaced
running in the Shorts The Rosehill proprietary'deserve
well at the hands of the racing public for their endeavors
to protect the interests of their patrons, the idiots who
find the sinews of war to keep the ball rolling. Randwick
and the other clubs do sometimes make an example—of
some poor devil of a countryman, but it remains for Rose-
hill and Kensington to tackle the influential party.
* * * *
Ted Power’s stable scored three good wins at
Flemington with O’Trigger, Bloodshot, and Homespun.
The last-named animal seems to have a talent for coming
with a rattle at the end of a meeting. He won the Fare-
well Handicap at V.R.C. Autumn, and the Final Handicap
last Saturday, the boy Callinan bringing him home neatly
on each occasion.
Merry Boy, who was one of The Bulletin’s
fancies for a place in the Cup, managed to capture the
V.R.C. Handicap (1J miles) in pretty good style. Cook’s
sturdy horse, although only a second-rater, will always be
worth considering for long-distance races when the han-
dicapper treats him kindly. Over hurdles he might prove
equal to the best of them.
Hopscotch was backed freely for the 2 miles
C. B. Fisher Plate, on the chance that the pace, with
only three horses running, might not be strong enough
to find out his weak spot. However, Tir6 and Bloodshot
made satisfactory time (3min. 35jsec.), and the big mare
was beaten badly. Are the “ fly-flats” quite satisfied?
Of two-year-olds that didn’t win at Y.R.C. meet-
ing, the handsome Patriot is most likely to distinguish
himself anon.
The gate-receipts at Flemington this time were
the biggest for five y'ears, the increase in grand-stand
attendance being explained by an exceptional gathering
of South Australians and the new rush of sports from the
boomsome West. No doubt the prestige of the big event,
which suffered from the successive victories of two com-
parative “ rotters ” in Glenloth and Tarcoola, had been
much restored by Patron and Auraria, and now Newhaven’s
brilliant win has put the Cup back upon the pedestal
where Carbine placed it in ’9O. It would pay the V.R.C.
to engage Newhaven, at a high salary, to appiar again
next Spring.
The two dining-saloons under the Flemington
Stand—one for the vice-regal “ set” and the other for the
high priests of Horse, local and visiting are ele-
gant retreats. The stewards’ room, entered through a
fernery, is perhaps the more poetical feeding-place, whilst
the Governor’s is somewhat stronger in expensive details,
but a hungry aesthete could be equally happy in either of
tfiem. The lilies and languors of decoration around the
walls make an appetising contrast to the roses and rap-
tures of cold tuckgy, &c., on the festive boards. And the
festive boards, by thS way, don’t seem to be spread for
more people than the Club is reasonably justified in
lunching gratis.
* * • *
Thrice only has the Melb. Cup been won by a
chestnut. Glencoe in ’6B, Patron in ’94, and Newhaven
are the trio.
* * * *
Newhaven’s pedigree is a bit of a facer for the
scientific breeding enthusiasts, as, if he races at ’Ome, the
fatal letters (h.b.) will be subjoined to his name on
account of the breeding of his great-grandfather’s dam
being unknown. If the gallant chestnut goes on all right
he will, however, be able to hump the noxious adjunct
and yet win and beget winners in due season.
* * * *
“ The Australians,” writes a travelling Bulletin
correspondent, “ had rather a rough passage from
Southampton to New York. One of the funniest inci-
dents of the trip across occurred upon the first day out,
when most of the team were seated in the smoke-room.
The great bulk of the passengers were Americans return-
ing home, and one Vic. batsman, who had had 1 quite
enough ’—which remark applies to most travellers on the
day of embarkation—got into a heated argument with 6ft.
of solid muscle (a young Bostonian) upon the question of
supremacy between an Englishman and an American.
The young American, declaring that a ‘ God-damned
Yank ’ was as good as an Englishman any day, stood up
and began taking his coat off to fight, whereupon a friend
of his interposed : ‘ For God’s sake, don’t fight him ’ —
meaning the batsman— 1 he’s a trained athlete.’ That
was enough : the Bostonian at once got his coat on again,
and he and the Gumsucker soon afterwards shook hands.
Considering that since the batsman’s attack of rheumatiz
his comrades have referred to him as the 1 old crock,’
the joke will stick—he will probably be known as 1 the
trained athlete ’ for many a day to come.
“ On nearing New York it was announced in
the saloon that a sailor had been caught stealing from
trunks in the hold. For a lark, the boys began chaffing
Joe Darling, telling him that his baggage had been
broken into —which, queerlv enough, proved later to be
quite true. When caught the sailor had on a brand-new
suit of Darling’s clothes, an Australian XI. tie, and a ring
belonging to Darling. On landing at New York the ship-
ping co. fully recompensed Darling for the damage done,
and” the sailor now stands committed for trial.
“Any needed further illustration of Harry
Musgrove’s business capacity was furnished in the final
stages of the tour. On Saturday, sth Sept., at 5.15 p.m.,
the last ball of the tour was delivered at Hastings, and on
the following day (Sunday), at the Tavistock Hotel, Lon-
don, where the team had returned the previous evening,
Mr. Musgrove had prepared and presented to each man a
full and complete statement of the whole trip showing
receipts and expenditure, with vouchers for each item ;
and with it each man's cheque in full payment of his
share. The older members of the team were completely
astounded at such expedition, some of them remarking
that more than one former manager had not yet furnished
statements in full, although years had elapsed. The
natty little manager has left an unprecedented good
impression amongst the cricket authorities at ’Ome, and
while his services are available no one else will personally
conduct Australian Elevens in England.
“ The Americans have shown every considera-
tion to the Australians and their womenkind ; in the
way of hospitality' they far exceed the Englanders.”
* * * *
The second day of N.S.W. Wheelmen League’s
Summer Carnival turned out a distinct success from a
racing standpoint. The fact that no more than 8000 paid
at the gates proves that the Sydney public is thoroughly
aware that the League is unable at present to accommo-
date spectators. The League cannot hope to score big
financial successes when thousands of people are forced
to stand all the afternoon or else sit down in the dust;
nor will a long-suffering public rush to pay double money
for a grand-stand and reserve which are so unfortunately
situated that they give the worst possible view of the
racing.
Carpenter, in his heat of the Sydney Wheel
Race, bulloeked himself into third place with splendid
gameness ; and his riding was a big contrast to that of
O’Brien, who always w'aits for somebody to do the pacing
for him.
Cartwright, the ex-ped., considered by his stable
to be a dead-bird for the League Cup (half-mile), started
his final sprint with the bell’s ringing, but was out of it
half a lap from home. Fallick (his racing-name is F.
Gregory), an old interprovincial footballer, won his race
(£2O) with a long, determined spurt, and M‘Combe was
third. What a desperate struggle he made to get up !
Don Walker made even his admirers stare last
Saturday. In his heat of the Sydney Wheel Race (two
miles) he and M‘Lean paced one another lap and lap up to
the field ; and Walker, just before the last lap, went past
his field on the outside like a flash, and after leading for
700yds. was beaten only on the post by little Congdon.
Likewise, in the final, Walker paced Kuhle up in the third
lap, in almost Bilmartin style.
The Five-mile Championship of Australasia,
with its £25 first prize and gold medal, was a plum for
which Ken Lewis and Parsons reserved themselves.
Lewis, during the week, had had a bad fall on the track,
cutting his knees and considerably incapacitating him-
self ; and Parsons, who is much out of form, had been
with Johnny Coleman to Coogee in the morning. Parsons
expected, if the race were slow, to have a chance in his
finishing sprint with the strong wind behind his back
down the straight. The race, however, was a succession
of exhausting spurts, and the final struggle began at the
very beginning of the long- last lap. Now Pither, now
Walne, led, but Parsons, riding with splendid judgment,
watched Lewis and waited on his wheel. Half-a-lap from
home Lewis wetit to the front, and Parsons jumping
instantly', the pair shot out with a terrible spurt, which
left the others standing. For 50 yards Parsons promised
to give Lewis the race of his life, but, entering the straight
Lewis picked up his machine in brilliant fashion, broke
away from Parsons and won by several lengths. The
moment the winner flew past the post he sat up, swerved
from side to side, and after going a little way fell in a
faint. Parsons, though sick, too, was able to walk in and
raise some sort of a smile.
W. J. C. Elliott, off 195yds., won his heat of
Sydney Wheel Race as he liked, but was walloped out in
the final through want of condition. He is training for
the Austral —the great Melb. cycling event—for which he
has been favorite several times. His chance, like every
other man’s chance, will depend in great measure on the
way the race is run. As a foot-runner he was almost an
even-timer, and it is to his quickness with his legs that he
owes his cycling pace. He is a nerveful, clever rider, and
the best old-timer to carry a man s money in the Austral.
The best new man to back is either Clinton or Matthews.
Matthews, trainer Lee’sprot6g6, is on 250yds., and, as Lee
recently imported a special racer for his man, and also
scratched him for all recent Sydney engagements, the in-
ference is that Lee sends Matthews this time for certain.
Elliott gives Matthews 100yds., and, should there be a
good pacer in front of Elliott to bring him up, Matthews
goes down in finishing. There are not many who can
sprint with Elliott. j
Walne’s riding was a treat. He, Meadham, and
M'Combe paced each other in their heat of the Sydney
Wheel Race, and all got paced. In the final, the back
men, Walker, Kuhle, Meadham, Walne, and M'Combe,
brought each other quickly up to the,leaders. Beginning
the last lap, Walne shot out, and, sustaining a splendid
run all the way, came home two lengths in front of Kuhle.
Being a bridge-carpenter, Walne is always in hardy con-
dition, and it was purely condition that enabled him to
snatch this £ 100 prize.
Dunlop tyres added another win to their endless
list when Ken Lewis secured the Five-mile Championship.
Dunlop camps, lasting a fortnight each, will shortly be
started on Australian cycling grounds, and all the best
riders will strive to lower the world’s records.
Plugger Davison nipped the £7 first pacing
prize in the Five-mile Aus. championship. Davison has
been unwell lately, suffering from rheumatism.
Last Saturday was a day of numerous and
bunched fields, yet there was not one fall. In the last
race (the Open Handicap) 44 started, and though accident
was always imminent, all came through safely. Parti-
cularly Harris, who won the first prize of £l5.
G. Meadham will have to husband his strength
if he wants to win another £lOO prize. He would have
had a good show in the Sydney YVheel Race, had he not
ridden the triplet just before against time. The triplet,
steered by Elliott, did a gruelling go against the wind,
and rattled off the mile in 1.57 dead —Parsons’ time.

Bilmartin goes to Westralia to race until his
disqualification period closes.
Plaeke, the big fellow who just pulled round
after his rough-and-tumble with Queensland giant Barker,
has posted £lOO with a London paper for a match with
Jem Smith. Bad as Smith is, he is good enough to
slaughter the fanatic Plaeke.

Cavanagh, about the best, of the Lillie Bridge

A. G. Butler, a Sydney boy and med. at St.
Mary’s (London) Hospital, took the 1000yds. Challenge
Cup from the holder at the London athletic club sports.
The time was only 2 3-ssec. worse than the professional
record.

Boidi, the Italian —a faster man than Bilmartin,
probably—reckons that he has no chance of winning the
Austral Wheel Race from scratch. .

Towns, who lately beat Neilsen in besUand-best
boats, went down before the old’un in the sculling handi-
cap, in light skiffs, at Hexham, N.S.W., last Saturday.
Neilsen 401 b., Towns 451 b., and Peter Kemp 301 b. were in
the final heat. Towns gave up, and Neilsen won from
Peter Kemp by a length. At Balmain regatta, in All-
Comers' Race (22ft. boat), Towns (40sec. behind) beat,
Neilsen by two lengths, but in best-and-best bpats Neilsen
(55sec. behind) turned the tables, and beat both Towns
(60sec. behind) and Kemp (53sec. behind). Towns' style
pleased the critics, and a big future is predicted for him if
the rowing revival continues.

Corbett and Fitzsimmons are not likely to meet
in England, as the National Club..adheres to its resolve
not to allow Corbett to fight at its rooms. Corbett says
he won’t fight privately, to which Fitz has a decided ob-

After each side had scored one easy win, the
final of the Vic.-N.S.W. bowling contests was won by 98
to 94 points by the Victorians, who were in the rear up to
the last couple of ends. The rubber was practically won
by a magnificent shot by the lanky Scotchman Munro,
the hero of all three games. As bowlers go, both sides
were trained a trifle fine, and the games were marked by
a remarkable absence of the adjournments for refresh-
ments iioually inseparable from the ancient game of
bowls.

There promises to be a deadlock between the
SA. and N.S.W. cricket authorities. S.A.C.A. is deter-
mined not to play N.S.W. on Dec. 18 in the absence of
Giffen, Hill, Darling, and Jones, and as N.S.W. has
already refused to give way, there will be trouble. There
is a great deal in the argument of the younger province
that she cannot be expected to find a team outside the
four named.

The League of American Wheelmen confines its
membership to “ white cyclists over the age of 18 years.”
The Australian Leagues are lesS punctilious regarding the
color line, and open their ranks freely to all, irrespective
of creed or nation, no rule even existing to debar Ah
Geap, the Chow champion, should'he feel inclined to join.
So far, however, the only man of color in any of the Aus-
tralian organisations is Dicky Darrell, the West Indian
ped and trainer. Dicky is the darky of the abnormal legs
who flits about the arena at all Melb. cycling meetings,
and who, on one occasion, started in a race himself in a
moment of mental aberration.

The Dunlop Pneumatic Tyrw*Go. advertises that
the American Dunlop tyres being unsuitable for Austra-
lian roads will not be guaranteed by them. As our roads
are superior to the American, can it be that a good tyre

‘ ‘ Denticura, ” the invention of Rev. Rior-
dan, of Bathurst, N.S.W., is Australia’s con-
tribution to the great horde of toothache remedies,
and it is claimed that Denticura will murder an
achiiig molar in less time than any other instru-
ment or drug extant, bar the dentist’s forceps or
front-step. It is composed of two metal plates
which are clasped over an erring tooth, and forth-
with set up a current of electricity that turns the
pain into a dreamy kind of thrill like that of the
kiss of a plump 16-year-old blonde with a breath
of violets and honey. For the tooth of the other
sex, the other kind of ecstasy is supplied, fitted
with a waxed moustache like Judge Madden’s.
And a big sale is confidently anticipated for
Denticura.*

When, asks a Bulletin correspondent, is Aus-
tralia going’to have a general “Australian Herd Book”
corresponding to the “British Herd Book”? British
shorthorns are degenerating, and stud sires of any value
are becoming scarcer year by year. British stock-owners
are, therefore, contemplating importations of stud
animals from Australia, but are restrained by the absence
of an official pedigree record. There is a stud-book for
blood-racers, and that is why so many officially-recognised
pedigree horses have of late gone to England and else-
where. Official records are the only guarantee the non-
Australian resident can be decently expected t<? go by,
and their non-existence means a tremendous annual loss
to Australia.

“My daughter was afflicted with
Eczema of the most aggravated
type. The disease first appeared in
eruptions on her head, then her hair
began to fall out, and in spite of
the best medical advice and treat-
ment she grew steadily worse. The
sores were full of matter and were
extremely offensive. Her eyes be-
came affected, and she was, in truth,
in a terrible state. My neighbors
were very sympathetic and took
great interest in the case. They
persuaded me to try Ayer’s Sarsa-
parilla, and I am most thankful to
be able to say that this wonderful
medicine completely restored my
daughter’s health. She has now as
good a head of hair as anyone could
wish, her eyes are perfectly well,
and she is a fine girl of eight years
with every prospect of growing up
to be a strong and healthy woman.”

The proprietor of a Melb. seaside bathing-
place relates a touching tale of gratitude. A visi-
tor to his baths, unable to swim, had dived into
10ft. of water and, not unnaturally, disappeared
from view after a few seconds of gurgling protest.
The cries of the other bathers brought the owner
on to the spot, and, after three long dives, he
in imaged to raise the apparently drowned to the
surface—the rescuer himself being by this time
utterly exhausted and bleeding at the ears. After
a few minutes’ rest, however, he set to work, and
in an hour had restored the man to life. In another
hour the rescued, having been warmed up with
whisky and hot bricks, was sufficiently recovered
to ask for his saviour, and, upon the latter appear-
ing, he turned his head round the corner of the cab
into which he had been lifted and observed impres-
sively : “ I’ll never come into your blanky baths
again ! ” Another well-to-do man, who had fought
desperately before being baled out, thanked his
rescuer effusively and handed him sixpence. He
wasn’t a Governor either.
A celebrated London surgeon lately re-
moved from a woman a tumour so hard that a
knife would not cut it. It was taken away by
dissecting out the cellular tissue to which it was
attached. When sawn open after removal, it was
found to consist of a hard shell of calcareous mat-
ter, inside which was closely packed a full-grown
doubled-up baby in such excellent preservation
that even the brain was intact and in the softness
of life. Twenty-two years ago the mother entered
Guy’s Hospital, telling the surgeons a history of
pregnancy which should have resulted in a birth
three months previously. Extra-uterine foetation
was diagnosed, and as the woman was not suffer-
ing from anything beyond inconvenience, it was
decided not to interfere. Recently the tumour
began to enlarge greatly and painfully, and opera-
tion was resorted to. That child had actually lain
for 22 years in that limy shell like a dead chick in

One of the best results of Protection in
Melbourne is the umbrella-making industry, which
at the present time wouldn’t need protecting at
all, but for the prejudice of certain Anglomamacal
shopkeepers in favor of imported brollies. The
better class article can be made up as cheaply in
Melbourne as it can be indented from ’Ome, never-
theless a few old-fashioned tailors, and haber-
dashers, here and there, continue to import (from
dealers, not manufacturers) and pay a customs tax
upon umbrellas identical in every respect —stick,
frame, and silk cover—with those that are pro-
curable from the local Hartnell and Co., and other
firms, on much better terms. The big buyers, of
course, now go to the Melbourne maker for all
their “good stuff,” whilst continuing to import
the cheap rubbishy products of sweated London
labor. With these the local factories can’t com-
pete, nor do they want to be able to. The um-
brella trade in Melbourne supports a small army
of girls who earn a decent living, and look quite
smart on it.

intended taking him in a waggon to Wangaratta
(about 60 miles) next morning to see a doctor. I
gave him a few of your Pills. lam pleased to
inform you that having to pass their camp next

valuable Remedies.”

never regret trying your Alfaline Pills, as they
had a wonderful effect on my complaint, which

A Wonderful Cure.
Herr Rassmussen. August, 1894
Dear Sir, —In the year of 1871 I was eight da 's
in the water sheep-washing, and contracted rheu-
matism and stiffness in the joints, and have tried
all advertised medicines. When I came to Sydney
I had a great difficulty in walking, and went to
the Turkish baths, which did no good. Passing
your window I saw a testimonial from Mr. E.
W. O’Sullivan, M.P., with the same complaint as
I had, which led me to try your Remedies. On
Thursday before Good Eriday I took the first of
your Pills ; since then I have used 4 boxes Special
Powerful Alfaline Vitality Pills, 3 boxes Special
Powerful Alfaline Rheumatic Pills, with Liver
and Kidney Pills, and free use of your Alfaline
Eucalyptus Oil, and I am now, with the blessing
of God, as well in health as I was 23 years ago.
I can with great confidence recommend your
Remedies to anyone suffering from the same com-
plaint. May you long be spared under God to
be a blessing to suffering humanity.
I remain, dear sir, yours very gratefully,
JOHN KEAY.

a sufferer from General Debility of the Nervous
System for over seven years, and having tried
without success several of the leading doctors
both in Sydney and Melbourne, I was advised to
try your Alfaline Remedies. lam thankful I did
so, for after a few courses of the Alfaline Remedies
I am now completely cured, and I shall be most
happy to recommend your remedies to anyone
suffering as I was. Thanking you for your
courtesy and the uniform patience with which
you have treated me, allow me to say that you
can make what use you may think proper of this.
Wishing you every success, allow me to remain,

A GEUEEAL’S DAUGHTER.
CURED OE RHEUMATIC AND NEUR
ALGIC PAINS, ANAEMIA, NERVOUS
HEADACHE, AND GENERAL WEAK-
NESS BY DR. WILLIAMS’ PINK
PILLS.
The Hampshire Independent sent a special
commissioner to ascertain the facts in the follow-
ing case. His report was as follows : “ I received
instructions to interview Lieutenant General
Clement R. Shaw, now living with his family, in
honorable retirement, at St. Paul’s Vicarage,
Shanklin, Isle of Wight. I explained to the
General that I "was anxious to obtain some per-
sonal explanation as to the narrow escape I heard
one of his daughters had recently experienced.
At that he brightened visibly. ‘ You must know,’
he said, ‘l’m just a bit of an enthusiast on this
point, but the tale is very short. Nearly two
years ago my daughter—-the one you referred to —
came home from India, and when I joined her in
London I found her ill in bed. She had rheumatic
and neuralgic pains ; she was perfectly bloodless,
listless, and in a generally weak and prostrate
condition. We called in a doctor, and lam bound
to say that he succeeded in getting her out of bed ;
but she was still absolutely colorless, was in great
wretchedness, and suffering from what I should
call anaemia or bloodlessness. She had a kind of
fever, nervous headache, and other pains. We
went to Bembi’idge, in the Isle of Wight, and
there I first heard of Dr. Williams’ Pink-Pills for
pale people. Indeed, I was recommended to try
them, and I did so. My daughter took the first
bottle, and they had a marvellous effect upon her.
She regained her color, she lost her pains, and be-
came altogether different; and after she had been
taking them some time, she came in one day after
her walk, and said to me, “ Why, father, I feel
quite a glow through me. ” She went on taking
the pills, and I am glad to tell you that she re-
covered completely. I have had a great deal to
do with medical men in this country and in India,
and they laugh at the idea that patent medicines
cure any disease. But I have given you this case,
and I know my daughter’s recovery was due to
Dr. Williams’ Pink Pills for Pale People, without
a doubt. Their effects were marvellous, and Ido
not speak without first ascertaining the fact.’'’
This wonderful remedy is offered to the public
with a full confidence that there is no disease
arising from a watery or impoverished condition
of the blood, or shattered nervous forces, which it
will not cure if the directions are faithfully fol-
lowed and the treatment persisted in. Dr.
Williams’ Pink Pills for Pale People are not a
patent medicine, but are a thoroughly scientific
preparation, the result of years of careful study on
the partof an eminent Edinb. University physician,
and they were successfully used by him in his
everyday practice for years before being offered
for general sale. They positively cure Rheumatism,
Sciatica, Lumbago, and Neuralgia, and are a
specific for all diseases of women, such as anaemia,
poor and watery blood, female irregularities,
nervous headache and hysteria. They are not a
purgative medicine, but brace up and permanently
strengthen the whole system.
Dr. Williams’ Pink Pills are obtainable from all
leading chemists, or from the Dr. Williams’ Medi-
cine Coy., Queen’s Place, Sydney, who will for-
ward (post paid) on receipt of stamps or post order

S.M. Herald, apropos the Dederer com-
mutation, says that the execution of youths is
“ not unknown ” in Australian history. Not un-
known? Why, the very first execution the his-
torian comes upon is that of James Barret, a
youth of 17, who was hanged in Sydney for rob-
bery in 1788. ' ' ■
N. : “In Melb. I notice good houses being
built, right in the thick of the mushroom deserts
of empty, rubbishy, building-society houses that
cannot be sold or let. And these new places let
freely, too. Meanwhile, the house mullock of the
Permanent Evanescent Building Society is being
hitched up to decorate Bungaree and Bungeeltap.”
Ibsen is said to be a very provincial-minded
snob. He goes every day to the Grand Hotel in
Christiania to be gazed at whilst he strikes a
series of high-art atti udes. His recalcitrant hair
becomes, by comparison, more aggressive under a
carefully poised and polished silk-hat, and he
carries a small mirror to assist him in playing vari-
ations upon his whiskers with a pocket-comb.
At a recent meeting of Kyneton (Vic.) Agri-
cultural Society, a valiant champion of the magpie
stated that “he had often seen mice thrown into
the air and dexterously caught before reaching the
ground by the magpies, who gobbled them up in
very quick time.” The trail of the American
agricultural anecdote is over this statement.
THE AUSTRALIAN GEM TRADE.
H. Newman, the Well-known jeweller of 175
Ehzabeth-street, Melbourne, is the largest buyer
of opal in Australia, and opal miners will find it
to their advantage to send their opal direct to
him. The firm has a reputation for straight deal-
ing extending over a period of 40 years, which is
a sufficient guarantee to consignors that they will
be honorably treated. H. Newman is also a
buyer of all other Australian gems.*
Mr. W. Collins, who was commissioned to
engage meat-preserving, canning and salting ex-
perts in America for one of the Q meat companies,
remarks to Sydney D.T. :
“ ‘ Australians have been doing very badly in the meat
trade compared with the Americans. Here we have
better meat, but the difference in price is tremendous,
and all because we do not put it up properly. Cattle in'
Chicago yards are worth a shade over three times as much
a,s they are in Q. markets ; i.e. , cattle of an equal quality.
Our idea is to make money in the industry where now
there is none. One of the great pulls which the trade has
m America arises from the fact that although their cattle
cost three times as much as ours, they have a good market
for the best cuts of fresh meat. The prime joints are
sent as far as New York, 100 J miles from Chicago, and
fetch good prices. If the whole of the meat went into
the cans they could not, afford to pay so much for the
cattle.’ . Mr. Collins, is confident that very much better
meat will be put up in Q. when the men he has engaged
get to work. His principal man was in charge of Messrs.
Nelson Morris’-cannery, Chicago, where from 2000 to 3000
cattle are killed daily.”
Nervous sufferers will find it worth their
while to peruse Herr Rassmussen’s advt. on page
23 of this issue.*
Apparently, the “Pinafore” variety of
British sailor is real, after all—at least, Melbourne
Age reports having discovered him. According
to its statement, a wildly-patriotic tar belonging
to the bloated ironclad Katoomba invaded a Mel-
bourne pub. and proceeded to sing, in a dreadful
voice, the “ Death of Nelson.” At the end of the
first verse, he suddenly grew suspicious of a small
man who was doing nothing in particular at the
other end of the bar, and asked him, truculently,
what he thought of Nelson. The man was
French, and began to reply in badly damaged
English that he had no objection to Nelson, but
when the briny one realised, by his accent, that he
wasn't a true Briton, he promptly knocked him
insensible. Then he indulged in copious blas-
phemy, and “ stoushed ” two Turks, who tried to
interfere on the partially-deceased Frenchman’s
behalf, and was just proceeding to pick up his
fallen enemies and batter their heads against the
floor when a right-thinking person struck him on
the ear with a lemonade bottle. And, instead of
six months’ hard labor, the comic rowdy was fined
ss. This public-house row is the nearest thing to
active service that Australia’s subsidised fleet has
yet accomplished, and the ss. fine is the first divi-
dend this country has got in return for an expendi-
ture of something like a million pounds.

An Artistic Soul.
[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
The opera-company broke up in San Fran-
cisco, and Antonio, the tenor, borrowed his way
out to the furthest mud-bank on Poverty Point
in less than a month. He had been down to four-
penny meals—and less than three per day—for
over a fortnight. It could not be considered
luxurious.
Redemption sometimes comes by way of good
looks,, and Antonio was dark and very handsome.
Some women loved his beauty and would have re-
deemed him. Antonio loved many women, and
consequently was not redeemed. No woman
willingly buys expensive feathers to decorate her
rivals.
Antonio knew much of books, and in the Public
Library, where he sat to read and to save shoe-
leather, he met a Professor who was also a Man,
kind-hearted and intermittently a drunkard. He
was married, and not too happily. Lecturing
when sober, and stray bits of journalism at other
times, enabled the Professor to keep a roof over
his wife’s head and a hat over his own.
Antonio was invited to share the humble home,
and was temporarily redeemed through the par-
tiality of the Professor for educated foreigners.
One day the Man came home unexpectedly and
saw the passionate face of his handsome guest
bending close, very close, over his unwilling wife.
Returning to the city he bought a revolver and
several drinks. Speeding home again per sub-
urban train he got fooling nervously with the
weapon, and it went off. A passenger was shot.
An arrest, a sobering-up, and a trial. The Pro-
fessor hopelessly swore he bought the revolver to
shoot a dog that disturbed his rest o’ nights ; the
wounded man and fellow-passengers swore it was
quite an accident, and a nominal fine was imposed.
* * * *
A newspaper brevity of a few days later :
This morning l the Italian opera-singer, Antonio, at-
tempted suicide at ’s restaurant by shooting himself
in the mouth. The hospital surgeons say the wound is
not likely to cause death, but Signor Antonio will not be
able to sing again.
Two years later a tall, dark foreigner and
a very pretty, fair-haired young woman paced a
windy wharf at Wellington, Maoriland. A
variety-show had just collapsed. As the couple
walked up and down in the gathering night they
used bitter words to each other.
Antonio . was protesting that he had only run
back upstairs at the lodging-house to get a glove
he had left in the room. At which his wife
sneered : “Yes, and left me standing in the hall
while you made love to the chamber-maid.”
Antonio drew, close to the woman and hissed :
Damn you ! ” in very good English.
The woman laughed.
“You ought to curse yourself, ” she said, “you
coward ! ” J
“I am not coward,” blustered Antonio.
Tauntingly the woman said : “ You are ! You
sought to bite the kind hand that fed you in San
n rancisco, and feared vengeance so much that you
tried to shoot yourself. Your cowardice spoilt
your aim.”
Further recriminations, some tears • then some
kisses in the shadowy night at the end of the
windy wharf, and the couple sauntered lovingly
aboard the steamer.
* * * *
Wanderings in many lands ensued, but the
wanderings led ever towards Poverty Point.
Variety-shows innumerable started on tour with
Antonio as manager and Madame as star. Some-
times hotelkeepers sent w r ord on ahead warning
trade-friends to look out for the Antonio crowd.
At other times the star would go on strike because
Antonio made violent love to one or other of the
lady dancers. Either of these things generally
broke the combination into dishevelled sections.
* » * *
A year or two more and Antonio is estab-
lished in a small, but pretentious, fruit business.
Some admiring compatriots have done this, other-
wise Antonio and his pretty wife would have
starved. A small fruit-shop is a sordid cage for
an artist of Antonio’s standing! But he still
loved the ladies—and himself. The woman chafed
and fretted. “She, too,” said Antonio, “has the
artistic soul.” But the bickerings grew more
numerous and bitter. She threatened often to leave
him, and just as often he threatened suicide. Then
she would tell him he was afraid, and shortly
afterwards there were tears followed by protesta-
tl(ms Ul? dying l°ve and passionate kisses.
Ihe neighbors complained to the police, and
Antonio’s countrymen swore excitedly when they
found he was always making excuses for the non-
payment of their loans.
At last Madame actually packed up and went
away for good. Though white with passion, An-
tonio politely raised his hat to her as the steamer
swung off from the wharf. For a week he was
mad with grief and for the want of good clothes.
The shop was shut up, and the fittings and furni-
ture seized for rent. The translation into English
of a column of Italian for a newspaper gave An-
tonio a guinea, wherewith he bought a revolver
and writing materials. To about a score of women
he wrote a letter each. One very loving one he
addressed to his wife and sent to the local news-
paper.
In the morning they found him dead by the
stage door of the local theatre. Only one chamber
of the revolver had been used ; only one had been
loaded. In his pocket was an old opera-pro-
gramme with the name of Signor Antonio starred
in big letters. The name was underlined heavily
in red ink.

Cow-Spanking.
TARANAKI, M.L.
[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
There is nothing in cow-spanking. I tackled it
when I first came to Taranaki—but, never again '
Broke 1 was, and humping bluey, and Taranaki
isn t the best place in the world to carry a swag.
Its too wet, and the roads are goat-tracks’
Besides, they are all small men there, with hold-
ings of only 100 to 200 acres apiece. My first iob
was on a place where they milked 120 cows Talk
about slavery ! You get up at half-past three in
the morning; muster cows in the dark; start
milking at four.
Milking isn’t hard work ! Wait till you have to
milk 120 between six—especially when the boss
and you are the only men, the others being his
missus and kids. Your wrists start first : they
ache worse than they would with a first day’s
shearing. Then, after a day or two, your hands
swell, you get cramp in them—in the mornings
you can hardly straighten your fingers. You are
also pretty certain to get cow-pox ; likewise your
nails fester. That’s one thing about Taranaki : I
cion t think a man in the district could get small-
pox—not if small-pox was the only di ease left in
the universe.
Bailing up your cows is nice, too. You have to
wade over your boot-tops in filth and drive the
beggars out. They always stand in the dirtiest
place they can find, and you may think yourself
lucky if you don’t get knocked over or slip down
If you do, you might be boiled for a week and
then you would smell unclean. When you have
got them bailed, it’s ten to one that the first you
go to leg-rope plants her foot in your stomach.
Very often the leg-rope breaks—they soon go
rotten in the wet- and then where are you ? Most
likely sitting out in the yard wondering what
struck you, with the milk making pretty shades
of color with the muck.
My boss was a religious man and had a notice
stuck up Swearing and smoking strictly pro-
hibited in shed and yards.Y"ct I've seen him
when he had put his trust in a rotten leg-rope, get
up and talk to the cow with a milking stool in a
manner that wouldn’t disgrace a Salvation Army
captain.
We would get the morning’s milking done about
8.30 a.m., when one of the youngsters would cart
the milk off to the factory. Another half-hour
would go in scraping down the bails—phew l
Breakfast would be about 9, and you had hardly
time to light your pipe before you were hurried off
to feed the calves.
I eeding Calves is fine fun—for the fellow looking
on. I had about 40 of the brutes to feed, and they
weren’t the youngest. There was a trough in the
paddock, and I would ladle the skim-milk out of
the tank where it was stored, and mix it with meal
and what they call hay-tea (made by boiling hay
in water till it gets black —a job done after work
at night). As soon as I got this stuff into the
trough, about 25 of the calves would nearly burst
themselves trying to see which could drink the
most in least time. The other 15 would put on
frills and stay in the furthest corner. I would go
after them with a bucket -Kinging out “Soun!
ti ll .! wasas dry as a wooden god stuffed
with fire-bricks I hey didn’t gi ve a moo for what
u j, m fcile bucket—-quite willing- to suck my
hand, however And when lat last-got one of
hem to put his head in the bucket he would
generally bunt, me and the bucket into next week.
By this time the calves at the trough had
finished, and would chase me round trying to suck
my shirt or trousers, and frightening the others
away Perhaps I used to swear most just at this
part but the swearing was very even all through.
len I had finished with the calves and left
them all sucking each other’s ears, the waggon
would be back from the factory, and I helped un-
load and feed the p!gs. After that, I just had a
minute toput on the water for washing-up, and it
ould be dinner-time. When dinner was over, I
vent and washed out big milk-tins for a couple
of hours, which generally made it close on three
oclock At three, I caught a horse and went
' Che ?°' v / a £ ain > knocking off milking about
T balf-past— quite ready for tea. By the
time i had a smoke, and got the hay-tea jigging it
v.as 10 o’clock, and I turned in for about five or
six hours.
Did I say no more cow-spanking for me ? Then
1 say it again—harder.

Louis Becke to The Bulletin from Lon-
don “ Going down the Strand the other day, the
weather horrible—sleety rain, cold wind, muddy
street, traffic blocked, drivers and pedestrians
pushing, struggling, and cursing to get ahead. A
procession comes crawling along out of a side-
street off the Strand—ten miserable wretches of
sandwich-men. Oh, the haggard faces, hunger-
filled eyes, and abject, despairing looks of each
man as the poor devils toiled along ! And the
sandwich - boards bore the inscription— ‘ Buy
1 issot s Life of Our Lord Jesus Christ.
1 ; rice i Six Shillings.’ Some of the men looked
like Christs, staggering towards Calvary. What
a subject for a painter with a sympathetic, bruta)
brush ! Title for picture, ‘ Christs of Trade.’ ”
According to the cablegrammer, Francis
Hart, of Westralia, the mannikin who helped
Gov. Robinson with his opera, was among the
crowd which howled down a Transvaal lecturer,
and called him bad names, and wanted to stoush
him with a chair-back, because he hadn’t sympa-
thised with “Dr. Jim.” This sort of thing is
supposed by the cablegrammer to be the kind of
local intelligence that Australia craves after. Yet
who in all this continent cares to know that the
little creature who helped Robinson with his opera
has been making a common Billingsgate of himself
at a London meeting ? Australia is full of shearers
and the like who use exactly the same kind of
language that F. Hart seems to have been using,
and more of it. To cable out Hart’s poor weak
abuse to the land of the great Australian adjective
is sending one small cinder to Newcastle.

Fortunate Cure of a General’s
Daughter.
(From the “Hampshire Independent.’’
The Hampshire Independent sent a special commis-
sioner to ascertain the facts in the followin''' case. His
report was as follows : —“ I received instructions to inter-
view Lieut.-Gen. Clement R. Shaw, who has won his
spurs in India, and is now living with his familv in honor-
able retirement at St. Paul's Vicarage, Shanld'iu, Isle of
Wight.
‘‘l explained to the General that I was anxious to ob-
tain some personal explanation as to the narrow escape I
had heard one of his daughters had recently experienced.
“At that he brightened visibly. ‘ You must know,’ he
said, ‘l’m just a bit of an enthusiast on this point ; but
the tale is very short. Nearly two years ago my daughter
—the one you referred to—came home from India, and
when I joined her in London I found her ill in bed. She
had rheumatic and neuralgic pains ; she was perfectly

bloodless, listless, and in a generally weak and prostrate
condition. We called in a doctor, and lam bound to say
that he succeeded in petting her out of bed ; but she was
still absolutely colourless, was in great wretchedness, and
suffering from what I should call aneemia, or bloodless-
ness. She had a kind of fever, nervous headache, and
other pains. We went to Bembridge, in the Isle of Wight,
and there I first heard of Dr. Williams’s Pink Pills'for
Pale People. Indeed, I was recommended to try them,
and I did so. My daughter took the first box, and they
had a marvellous effect upon her. She regained her
colour; she lost her pains, and became altogether dif-
ferent ; and after she had been taking them some time she
came in one day after her walk and said to me, ‘ Why,
father, I feel quite a glow through me.’ She went on
taking the Pills, and 1 am glad to tell you that she re-
covered completely. My daughter’s recovery was due to
Dr. Williams’s Pink Pills for Pale People without a doubt.
Their effects were marvellous, and I did not speak with-
out first ascertaining the facts. I have had a great deal
to do with medical men in this country and in India, and
they laugh at the idea that patent medicines cure any
disease. But I have given you this case, and that I know ;
I won t deal with any beyond my own personal experience
and knowledge, farther than to say that I believe the
results to have been satisfactory.’ ”
The Terrible Influenza.
ITS RAVAGES ARE APPALLING ONLY PROMPT
MEASURES CAN RESTORE THE SUFFERER TO
HEALTH.
The people of this country have good cause to view with
alarm an outbreak of influenza, as it leaves behind it more
shattered constitutions than any other known disease. Mr.
Edward Botting, for ten years' a councillor of the united
townships of Bedford, Olden and Palmerston, in Frontenac
County, is one who nearly fell a victim to this scourge
To a Whig correspondent Mr. Botting said : “ About two
years ago I had a bad attack of influenza, and the after-
effects of that malignant trouble brought me so low that
my friends despaired of my recovery.. I was troubled with
severe and constant pains in the back, sensations of ex-
treme dizziness, weakness, and was in fact in a generally
used-up condition. I had read frequently of Dr. Williams’
Pmk Pdls, and felt they must have some special virtues
else they could not obtain such strong endorsations in all
parts of the country. I determined to try them, and I
bless the day that I came to that conclusion. Before the
hrst box was finished I felt benefited, and I continued
their use until I was as strong as ever. I consider Dr.
Williams Pmk Pills the best medicine sold, and I would
box ’’ Wl^OU *’ them ' n the house if they cost me $5 a
S 4& ill /
Dr. Williams’ Pink Pills have had marvellous success in
removing the after-effects of influenza, and restoring - suf-
ferers to their former vigor. No other medicine can
accomplish the results they achieve, and those who have
suffered with influenza should use them without delay.
PALE AND SALLOW GIRLS.
What can be more distressing than to see a girl droop-
ing and fading in the springtime of youth ? Instead of
bright eyes, glowing, rosy cheeks, and an elastic step,
there are dull eyes, pale, sallow, or greenish complexion,
and a languidness of step that bespeak disease and an
early death if proper treatment is not promptly resorted
to and persisted in until the impoverished blood is en-
riched and the functions of life become regular. Upon
parents rests a great responsibility at the time their
daughters are budding into womanhood. If your daughter
is pale, complains of weakness, is “tired out” upon the
slightest exertion ; if she is troubled with headache or
backache, pain in the side, if her temper is fitful, and her
appetite poor, she is in a condition of extreme peril, a fit
subject for the development of that most dreaded of all
diseases—Consumption. If you notice any of the above
symptoms lose no time in procuring Dr. Williams’s Pink
I ills. They will assist the patient to develop properly
and regularly; they will enrich the blood and restore
health’s roses to the cheeks ; bright eyes and lightness of
step will surely follow their use, and all danger of con-
sumption and premature death will be averted. Wise and
prudent mothers will insist upon their daughters taking’
Dr. Williams’s Pink Pills upon the approach of the period
of puberty, and thus avoid all chances of disease or early
decay.
Dr. Williams’s Pink Pills are a sure remedy for rheu-
matism, Neuralgia, Paralysis, Locomotor Ataxy, St. Vitus
Dance, Nervous Headache, Scrofula, Chronic Erysipelas,
&c. They are not a purgative, but they restore pale and
yellow complexions to the glow of health, and are a
specific for troubles peculiar to the female, while in men
they effect a radical cure in all cases arising from worry,
overwork, or excess of any nature. Dr. Williams’s Pink
Pills are obtainable from all leading chemists, or from the
Dr. Williams’s Medicine Company, Queen’s-place, Sydney,
who will forward (post paid) on receipt of stamps or post-
office order, 1 Box for 2s. 9d., or a half-a-dozen for 14s. 9d.

[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
The sun looked down unwinkingly upon the roll-
ing sand-dunes covered with a scrabbly under-
growth of mallee, ti-tree and lianas. It looked
searehingly and pitilessly down upon the rubble
hut with its flat tin-roof and “hessian” substi-
tutes for windows. The everlastings stiffened and
curled in the fierce heat, and the earth sizzled and
fumed. The sweat from the doctor’s horse
quivered into the baked atmosphere and left
streaks of acrid salt ruled down his heaving sides.
No bird called. No insect hummed. The flies
were clinging to the shady sides of the limestone
boulders, and Sheol was in the air.
Inside the hotel all was as dark as a cellar,
and as close. There was the same stillness,
save for the heavy breathing of the man and the
woman and the children —all lying in one bed
smitten by the influenza-devil. The atmosphere
of the place was poison—fcetid, stagnant, and
charged with every foul human product. Only
one person besides the doctor moved in the den,
slowly and with a mechanical languor. She was a
girl of 19 or 20, who might have been good
to look upon but for neglect and uncleanli-
ness and the advance signals of disease.
Now and then the man ground his teeth
and groaned voicelessly. The woman whined an
occasional answer to a question from the doctor.
And the children slept the sleep of ptomaines and
carbonic acid gas. The girl stood listlessly at the
foot of the iron bed, supporting herself with both
lean, horny hands clutching its rusty rail.
“ How long have you been down?’’asked the
doctor of the woman.
“A week,” she complained ; and “he has been
in bed four days; them (indicating the children)
all took bad ten days ago.”
The doctor said little, but took temperatures,
auscultated chests, and made entries in his note-
book. It was a monotonous proceeding, broken
only when he went out for a pannikin of warm
water from the galvanised tank to wash his ther-
mometer. The man had the headache ; little else
of importance. The woman had the cough : the
cough that is like the rending of the soul from the
body ; but, again, little else of importance. The
children had the deadly, helpless, hopeless sleep,
from which they only awoke at intervals to moan
and toss and complain and go to sleep again.
Just then the man roused himself to beg for
“something for this ’ere pain in my ’ead.” It
was “driving him mad.” The woman would
“ never live through another night ” if she “ didn’t
get relief from this corf.” The children made no
complaint. They slept and breathed ptomaines
and carbonic dioxide. And the girl said nothing,
but gazed at the doctor with a hazy, half-intelli-
gent scare and gripped the iron bed-rail harder,
while her breath came and went in quick, irregular
gasps and her nostrils moved like those of a winded
hare.
“ Anyone to fetch out the medicine ? ” Perhaps
a neighbor would go if the doctor would ask.
Brandy ? Yes. A little chicken-broth ? Yes ;
Violet Pearl would make that.
“ Violet Pearl ! go and git Jimmy a drink!
Can’t yer ’ear ’im movin’ ? ” whined the woman in
a grieved tone; and then: “The girl is that
stoopid and mazy-like, she ain’t the leastest good
to nobody. As if it wasn’t bad enough to be nigh
onto dead without ’avin’ to worrit for everything
as is wanted ! ”
As the girl returned, stumbling over the uneven
limestone floor, her father broke out: “ For
Gawd’s sake, Violet Pearl, ’ow much longer are
you goin’ to let this ’an’kerchief dry on my ’ead?
W’ere’s the vinegar and water ? Wring it out
agin, carn’t yer ! ”
Sit down, said the doctor to her, a moment
later, “let me have a look at your chest.” List-
lessly she unfastened the dowdy calico bodice and
bared her thin neck and shoulders, breathing a
little harder, but not appearing much interested.
“ Hm ! ” said the doctor, as he moved the end
of the stethoscope here and there, and tapped with
his finger-ends on her all too plainly visible ribs ;
and then, a little later, “ Temperature 104°, pulse
120, left posterior base solid,” he wrote in his
note-book, and to the girl he added, “ You must
go to bed, and stop there! If you don’t do so
now, you’ll have to to-morrow, and then you may
not get out of it again.”
( A chorus came from the man and the woman,
‘ ‘ Lord sakes ! doctor, w’at are yer talkin’ about ?
oo’s to look arfter us ? She’s the only one as is fit
to move ; as for me (the woman continued alone),
I couldn’t get up and do nothink, not if—if —you
was to pay me ! an’ I’m sure ‘he ’ couldn’t do
nothink if ‘he ’ was to get up.” The man groaned,
and said his head would come off if he were to
move, and it was all nonsense talking of Violet
Pearl “laying up.” She was “always fancying
she had something the matter with her.”
The doctor sighed, and explained again, and at
last lost his temper. “ You good-for-nothing
brute ! ” he said, looking contemptuously at the
man. “ What the devil does your headache
matter compared with this girl’s chances of dying
in 48 hours if she doesn’t go to bed ? She’s fifty
times worse than your wife here ; and as for you,
you’re in no danger at all! ”
Then he was sorry he had lost his temper,
because it was of no use. The man groaned and
the woman whined, and the children slept, and
Violet Pearl smiled feebly and breathed a little
faster, and said she could get along all right till
Aunt Ltnrria came ; Aunt Emma had promised to
come the day after to-morrow. No one else would
come, because they were frightened of “catching
it theirselves. ” And again the doctor sighed, and
then swore silently and rode away to arrange with
a neighbor to take medicine to them.
Two days later he went again. The same baking
heat; the same white, glaring light from the sand
beating on the frowsy “hessian” and “sujee”
windows ; and, inside, the same fcetid and plague-
stricken atmosphere, and a silence this time
broken by a few large, yellow-bodied droning flies
that boomed and buzzed about the room.
The man was sitting up near the fireplace. The
woman whimpered in a corner, seated on a kero-
sene-box. The children slept on a “shakedown ”
of “ gunny-sacks ”in another corner. And on the
iron bed, covered r>y a coarse and dingy sheet,
which fell into hollows and stood starkly out in
horrible, unmistakeable ridges, lay something that
had been Violet Pearl.
She had “got along all right ’’ until that morn-
“g- Then the poor, willing, helpful spirit had
shaken itself free and left its partner, and the
man with the headache and the woman with the
cough had unwillingly got up to attend to their
wants themselves.

Mr. J. Cobb, of Bando station, Narrabri,
holds the Australian lambing record for this year.
From four paddocks, carrying from 12,000 to
20,000 sheep, the lambing record was 107 percent.,
IOOf per cent., 100 j per cent., and 100 per cent.,
and from his total of 14,000 ewes lie got a return
of 99| per cent, of lambs.
A Tas. country bailiff, also sub-inspector
under a municipality, levied on some goods for a
secured judgment creditor. They were sold for £2O.
The bailiff put in his own bill for £23, and wrote
to those concerned saying that he had kept pro-
ceeds of sale and requesting them to kindly for-
ward £3 to square the account. He was made to
disgorge. He had no out-of-pocket exes., and £3
was considered ample. What an attorney he would
have made !
Archdeacon Piddington may lay the flatter-
ing unction to his soul that his unprecedented
action in volunteering, at the trial, information
acquired by him in the exercise of his functions as
ghostly comforter of the condemned, probably
went at least some way towards saving the necks
of the cousins Dederer. The youth and ignorance
of the convicts also helped to save them from the
hangman. Also, the circumstance that N.S.W.
Legislative Assembly had passed the second read-
ing of a bill to abolish capital punishment was not
without its influence.
“ Some weeks ago,” says a Bulletin cor-
respondent, “ a mob of 112 bulls from Waverley,
Broadsound, 18 weeks on the road, arrived at
Hughenden, going towards Winton. After some
delay the bulls were dipped, as the chief inspector
had given a permit to cross on the condition that
they were dipped, paddocked for three weeks, and
again dipped. The bulls were undoubtedly sicken-
ing for tick fever at the time, though none had
then died. Three days after dipping 52 of the 112
were dead and others sick.”
The reprieved Dederers, as children and
boys, fill, as far as can be ascertained from local gos-
sip, Lombroso’sbillasto the criminal suggestiveness
of their appearance and habits. “Such children,”
says Lombroso, “ should never be allowed to grow
up amidst the dangers, temptations and associa-
tions of the towns.” The world is full of hasty
philosophers. Had the Dederers been sent to
sell papers in Sydney streets —well, another hasty
philosopher might lay down that they would have
been Bulletin poets by now.
Dear Bulletin, —Re the Torres Straits
brag that 26| fathoms there is an every-day depth
for diyers. The depth of 26| f. at the Catterthun
wreck was measured with a loadline ; the 26J- to
30 f. of the Straits-diver is measured by his air-
pipe. A fisherman knows the shape of his line
when he is angling in the least bit of current—
how, from the rod to the hook, it forms a segment
of a circle—and the Straits-diver’s pipe is the
same, only very much more so, as the current runs
stronger ; and the lengths of the pipe-couplings are
their measurements. Now, at 23.'.- f. depth, the
pressure per square inch is 601 b. Multiply this by
the number of square inches on the human body-
surface, and you have an idea what the thing
means. The whites have all perished at less than
20 f. in the Straits —Mapplebeck in 18 f., Harry
Allen in 10) f.—and, in any case where it was
possible to rely upon the evidence, it has been less
than 20 f. I will back the white diver every time
for depth and endurance, all things being equal.—

Land of crows and empty bottles,
Where no trees grow ; even wattles
Bloom not on your desert waste ;
Where prevailing types of mammals
Are the Afghans and their camels—
And the water’s salt to taste.
Where the dingo lives on rabbit,
Natives have a cadging habit,
Very hard indeed to quell ;
“ Gib it bacca ; gib it tehilling,”
Then—if you should prove unwilling—
“ Baal you gib it ? Go to ’ell.”

To escape from flies and ants;

Wash their shirts, or patch their pants.

Cater for the bush man only :
There he hies to spend his cheque ;
And the fruit of twelve months’ toiling
’Neath a sun that’s always broiling,
Goes in “ snake-juice ” down his neck.
Dreary home of desolation,
Drought, and dust, and gaunt starvation,
Lying mirage e’er in view ;

Read the following remarkable testimony of Mrs. M. A. Helleur, of
Sussex St., North Adelaide, So. Australia, whose portrait is given above:
“Some years ago, I suffered very severely from soreness and general
weakness of the system, being so badly affected that 1 feared even to go
from one room to another, on account of the strange objects that appeared
to flit before me. My doctor, after treating me for some time, without
any benefit, at last recommended me to try Aver’s Sarsaparilla. I took
his advice, and am pleased to say that the effect was really wonderful.
Vigour was restored to my system, mv nerves were strengthened, my spirits
brightened, and I was enabled to return to my usual occupations. I might
say that several of my friends and relatives have used .Ayer’s Sarsaparilla
with like beneficial results. I believe it to be the best health-restorer
ifliat has ever been offered to the suffering masses.”

Bonnington & Co., Manufacturers of Irish Moss.
Adamstown, 11th September, 1896.
Dear Sirs, —Being a sufferer for years from fibroid phthisis and bronchitis, I desire to
add my testimony in favor of your Irish Moss. As a soother of irritating cough, with much ex-
pectoration, I have found it to be the most effectual of anything I have tried. It loosens the mucus,
which, therefore, comes mere readily away, and the cough is thereby considerably pacified.
Yours respectfully, THOMAS STOKER.
