Geography and Art
A line running from Edinburgh to Athens
roughly divides the art map of Europe.
North-east of it music is the great art;
south-west painting, sculpture and architec-
ture. Literature is common to all. Italy,
France, Belgium and Britain have produced
great musicians, and Germany has produced
Durer and Holbein, but the division never-
theless holds good.
Stories are told equally in Arctic igloos
and equatorial huts ; music has a less wide
but still large field of origin; but painting
and sculpture (as recognised by us) origi-
nate from but a small part of the earth’s
surface. In Europe they favor temperate,
coastal, insular and peninsular regions and
avoid all others. They will not thrive on
the southern shores of the Mediterranean,
even sculpture, a warm climate lover; and
the hardier painting has only of late ven-
tured as far as Edinburgh and Glasgow. The
unkindly interior and the cold of the Scandi-
navian peninsula are unproductive where
sculpture is concerned, and very little paint-
ing has come from them. The explanation is
that, painting and sculpture in comparison
with literature and music are arts that de-
rive from out-of-doors—particularly sculp-
ture. For the production of sculpture,
Greece was endowed beyond all other coun-
tries with the necessary requirements—race,
the clearest atmosphere, the least rainy and
most temperate climate; the most varied
coastline and bare land-surface to catch and
cast significant light and shade. Within her
balmy zone nudity was normal and the body
familiar to the sight. At every turn the
Greeks saw form clean-cut and uncompro-
mised. On their meagre land surface few
edge-softening woods existed, and, as if to
constrain them into expression by sculptural
form, the mainland and archipelago yielded
the mpst famous of workable marbles, Parian
and Pentelic. Italy, almost as well-favored,
ranks, in this art, easily second to Greece,
with France, who took her cue from Italy,
third. The Netherlands and Britain are too
cold to entertain Lady Sculpture. Spain,
on her gaunt plateaux, is too harsh climati-
cally and bigoted religiously towards bare
bodies, and in the milder south inherits a
fanatical Saracenic dislike of human repre-
sentation. France is indebted for her plastic
proficiency to the Midi and her half-Italian
southern coast, the source of her ideas of and
inclination towards clear-cut form. Appreci-
ation of animal form in its nudity is a sine
qua non in sculpture in the round. In the
case of Paris the genius of the French draws
from the south the sculptural atmosphere in
which otherwise (owing to climate) she
would be deficient. France is therefore, in
effect, an outpost of the Mediterranean
empire of sculpture, and at present is much
more important than her rather decayed base.
In the TJ.S.A. central heating, clear skies,
and athletics have led to the making
of statues, which, from the natural con-
ditions, are not logically to be expected.
Spiritually they are French importations.
In painting Italy, France, Spain and Eng-
land have all produced great schools.
Now. painting looks only at the appear-
ance of things as from a fixed point at a
screen. Unlike the sculptor the painter is
unconcerned with parts of objects not visible
to him, but sees their “effect” as on a
ground-glass camera-finder, or as on a tapes-
try, the’ reverse side of which may (for all
he cares) be nothing but tag-ends. Thus
all things even faintly to be seen are subject
matters for him. A fog with successive,
flat, blurred-edged silhouettes of graded
monotones, and the strongly-lit portrait
whose nose comes forward almost to the can-
vas’s surface, are equally themes for him, as
are the chequered light and shade falling
through breeze-stirred leaves overhanging and
wantoning with running water -Inclement
weather has less effect on the practice of
painting than on sculpture, for in the case
of figure-painting clothes may be part of the
effect, and in winter indoor work can be as
well done as in other seasons. In land-
scape, those who paint during the summer
may in winter either migrate, or complete
their summer-begun work in studios. The
Gulf Stream permits Britain to be a painting
country, but she is not sufficiently warm or
clear for sculpture. The sun’s sword is too
blunt sharply to cleave the light and shade
and thereby reveal the content, the volume
of form ; but by its fickle gleam are disclosed
those transitory glimpses of magical color
and weather that have been the inspiration
of a great school.
■To apply the foregoing to our own coun-
try, let us bear in mind the map of Aus-
tralia, or, rather, our coast and capitals.
From Perth to Brisbane all are temperate,
but, for easy comparison, let us confine our-
selves to- Sydney and Melbourne, though their
importance from the point of view of‘popu-
lation does not matter. Athens in its prime
was no bigger than Ballarat, and Florence
and Venice in their heyday were really
small places. First of all, the stock from
which the people grew was good. On such a
race favorable surroundings and conditions
should have a favorable effect. We have
them all. Glance at this table, compiled
from the “Commonwealth Year Book,” and
from it make deductions: —
Days Hours
Mean Rain-- Clear of of Sun-
Temp. fall. Days. Rain, .shine.
Athena .. ~ 64.3 16.48
Rome .. .. 60 32.67
Naples .. ~ 60.3 34.0 -
Madrid ~ .. 67.1 16.23
Marseilles .. 57.8 21.88
Trieste .. .. 57.6 42.94 —-
Sydney .. .. 63.0 48.02 33.1 158.2 1950.0
Melbourne . . 58.4 25.56 49.8 135 1939.0
The meteorological similarities of these eight
cities are evident, yet a scrutiny of their
slight differences in temperature and rain-
fall bears out what I have said in reference
to the sensitive reaction of man to them,
predisposing him towards either sculpture or
painting. The more detailed figures relating
to Sydney and Melbourne allow us easily to
note their differences and also to appreciate
the fortunate auspices under which our lines
are cast. We must also not overlook as a
factor the beauty of our natural scenery, due
to the combination of the hills, the strip of
varied and variegated littoral and the vamp-
ing sea.
At first it might appear that on account of
the greater number of clear days, a raiilfall
almost half that off Sydney and 23 days less
of rain, Melbourne would become more a
sculptoFs and less a painter’s city than Syd-
ney ; but offsetting this are two things in
Sydney’s favor —more hours of sunshine
(true, only 11 in the year) and a sdeg.
higher mean temperature. These two points
and her surfing beaches account for the uni-
versality of her open-air life; and as her
main recreation is one that finely exhibits the
human body, it will be surprising if many as
yet unemerged Sydneyites do not draw from
the beach-atmosphere the inspiration to
model the paragon of animals. The abun-
dance of fine days may bring this about in
Melbourne, for in the six warm months there
are only 53 rainy days (leaving 1291 fine
days) and in the year there are 50 “clear”
days. The mean temperature, though, is
lower than in Sydney, due to the colder
winter, which approximates nearer to the
orthodox conception of that season. In
order to arrive at reasonable conclusions the
figures should be compared with one’s know-
ledge of the physique of the places. Our
other capitals also are all fortunate in their
natural advantages, and these and our
general racial excellence will combine to
make us a great art-loving and art-produc-
ing people. By predilection, clear-cut, defini-
tive form and color will be our cardinal vir-
tues and tone, qua tone will come third.
These tendencies, too, will affect the arts of
literature and architecture and the emotions
which produce music. Altogether, the indi-
cations are that in Australia the Muses will
be held in. Hellenic esteem and reverently
and efficiently served.

James Stephens
I was as one who wandered in a wood,
Thick with strange shadows and slow-moving
lights,
For countless days and weary, breathless
nights, „ , , ,
Passing dull shapes of stone, rough-hewn and
crude,
That at the partings of the pathways stood,
While over me went by in sullen flights
Great moth-winged creatures winnowing age-
old blights,
And found an open valley sweet and good.
The sunshine through the apple blossom
glowed,
A yellow softness lay along the grass,
The wind was clean and scented with the
sea;
And worn and brown the quiet winding road
Slipped through the meadows to the moun-
tain pass,
While laughter and brave angels went with
me.

Easier Spelling
The opposition to simplified spelling (B.
6/9/-23.) is largely clue to an exaggerated
fear of its consequences. Other people have
reformed their spelling without any visible
aesthetic or practical loss, and if the English
language were not so insolently monopolistic
in the realm of business we would long ago
have had to do likewise or see the language
Sliakspeare spoke give place in business to
one more scientific. Dutch, being the lan-
guage of a small nation liable to be over-
looked amongst its big neighbors, has had to
simplify itself, and the gain has been enor-
mous. For hundreds of years a steady and
conscious evolution has gone on, and,
although there is a delightful flavor of rum-
barrel and salt junk and an aroma of spices
about the spelling of the logs of the old
Dutch voyagers and Company men—-and no-
body would want to read them any other
way—for everyday use the modern simplified
spelling is a handier instrument. I watched
a Dutchman give his daughter of six a scien-
tific book to read aloud; she did it without
hesitation, although nine words out of ten
were Greek to her. The reason was that,
having learnt the one or two simple rules
on which Dutch orthography is based, the
most multi-barrelled word had no terrors for
her.
To the Australian child the sound of a
new word is as unknown as the sound
of a new Chinese character is to the student
of Chinese. -In fact, the English word, owing
to its arbitrary spelling, is an ideograph in
precisely the same way as a Chinese character
is. The Chinese character is derived from a
remote ancestor which was once„a fairly
accurate picture of the thing it represented.
The pictorial quality has been lost or is only
faintly discernible, but the general shape
remains the same and is recognisable all over
China, although the native of Canton will
give it one sound and the native of Nanking
or Peking will give it another entirely dif-
ferent. In the same way the accidental
spelling of an English word has no fixed rela-
tion to the sound which an Oxford don, a
Southern American or a Sydneysider would
give it. The Australian schoolboy must
therefore learn his language in the same
laborious way as the Chinese schoolboy
learns his, by repetition and rote.
After the Chinese schoolboy has assimi-
lated as many of the 45,000 signs of his
written language as are required for his par-
ticular walk ip life, his creative faculty is
likely to be so atrophied and his learning
become so much a matter of routine that he
turns with difficulty to other branches of
study. That is probably one of the princi-
pal reasons why the Five Canons and the
Four Books have remained for so long the
conventional equipment of a Chinese scholar.
The Australian schoolboy is probably a poor
linguist for much the same reason.’ There
is _ some justification for retaining the
Chinese character because of the wonderful
beauty of its shape, but nobody but a philo-
logist would claim that there is more aesthetic
appeal in “hiccough” than in “hikuf,” or
whatever the scientific spelling of the sounds
should be. A phonetised Bible gives the eye
at first a painful shock, and an “Adonais”
in simplified spelling would seem at first
sight sheer profanation; but it is only a

FENG-SHUI.
The Novelist’s Novelist
Leonard Merrick is at once the most
transparently simple and the most elusive
of writers. He refuses to be labelled by
the conventional designations so dear to the
critic: Now he is a humorist; now lie turns
darkly tragical. He is a hopeless sentimen-
talist, and anon a cynic despairing over the
decay of human affections. He is too
romantic for a realist; and yet few writers
can more effectively destroy the glamoi 01
things. He loves to show how the romance
of marriage fades when people marry on
Insufficient means; he delights in picturing
the struggles of artistic mediocrity. And
yet he does it all with a touch so light that
even when he is most sordid he never fails
to charm. . „ . .
He has made the destruction of the glamoi
of the stage his mission in art. As far as
the true artist can ever preach, Merrick
preaches caution to those who would tread
the perilous boards for a livelihood. And
not. only the stage—all the arts to him
are fraught with danger and difficulty. In his
books we meet an endless yet never monoto-
nous series of singers who cannot get a
hearing, and novelists who cannot find a
publisher. But the young woman attempt-
ing to soften the heart of the theatrical man-
ager is his favorite. With something ap-
proaching relish he paints • her sufferings,
and points the finger of warning to others
of her kind. “It would take you five years
to earn a bare living if' you were a miracle,
says Elisha Le e to one who thinks she can
sing. “The Americans and Australians try
it for two or three, and then clear out with
broken hearts and empty pockets. It’s kill-
ing ; they starve while they are struggling
to be heard.” • _
Such is Merrick’s eternal cry. But his un-
fortunates never quite starve. He reduces
them to their last franc, with an irate land-
lady at the door ; but at that point we know
that their kindly creator will relent and call
in a timely Providence to save them from
despair. Perhaps this is why, for all his fre-
quent unhappiness (and he can be a very
unhappy author indeed), Merrick never leaves
us entirely depressed, as your true realist
does. Compare any of his books with A
Mummer’s Wife.” George Moore’s horrible
masterpiece is not unlike many of Merrick s
books in its theme ; there is the same third-
rate theatrical company, the same sordid
provincial boarding-houses, the same pathetic
specimens of human But Merrick
would never have • allowed Kate to take to
drink; he would have given her peace at last
with the kindly Montgomery. For
in his philosophy the worst never happens •
which some people may call a truer realism
than the unmitigated misery of the realists.
And so, even in “The Quaint Companions,
by far his most miserable book, he ends with
what H. G. Wells calls “a short, unjusti-
fiable note of sentimentality.” But surely
it is not unjustifiable to suppose that the
unhappy David and the unhappy Bee should
find some measure of happiness together after
their trials. Leonard Merrick does not be-
lieve in the conventional “happy ending”;
but he is old-fashioned enough to maintain
the comforting habit of, leaving his char-
acters in at least comparative peace of mind
at the conclusion of the misfortunes he has
forced them to endure.
Merrick, for all his charm and subtlety, is
not a popular author. He is too refined for
the public, which likes bright colors and high
lights. He belongs to that comparatively
small class of writers, an appreciation of
whom is the hallmark of an educated mind.
His standpoint is always that of the cul-
tured ; he is a master in the delineation of
the finer points of Philistinism; and the
Philistine reader, whose name is legion,
naturally cannot appreciate them. Cynthia
Kent, “a daughter of the Philistines,” causes
her husband acute agony because she inno-
cently says: “It isn’t the world, it’s the
people in it.” This incident, and much else
in the book, assumes that the reader will
view things in general from Humphrey
Kent’s essentially literary standpoint.
Merrick deals perpetually with the tragedy
of intellectual misfits ; and this theme cannot
vie in popularity with the tragedy of purely
emotional misfits, which forms the theme of
the average novel. Hence he remains “the
novelist’s novelist.”
He has much fellow-feeling for the cul-
tured man in his sufferings at the hands of
the. uncultured ; he sympathises with the
artist, too sensitive to face the coarse.treat-
ment of an uncomprehending and common-
place world. He has studied the artistic
temperament in all its branches; but while
he is sorry for the supersensitive soul he by
no means admires it. All through his books,
amid all his sympathetic understanding;,
there runs a vein of contempt for the artist.
It seems as though he were himself an artist
in spite of himself. Literature is “a degrad-
ing craft.” This is how he sums up “the
verbal artificer”;—
He has surrendered to a power which holds no thins:
sacred, not a son’s remembrance, nor a father’s love,
nor a husband’s agony—not death, nor devotion, nor
despair, and the power is inexorable and remorseless.
.. . .His mind is for ever alert to estimate the literary
value of his soul. When he fondles his child his
idolatry cannot save him from seeking copy in his
emotions, and when he sorrows by a grave his tears
shall not blind him to the virtues of a lament that
has not been written before.
Merejkowski, in “The Forerunner,” tells us
that Leonardo da Vinci looked on unmoved
at the execution of criminals, so absorbed
was he in trying to reproduce tlm facial
contortions produced by suffering. “If his
own mother were a-dying,” says his pupil
Cesare, “he would watch the contracting of
her eyebrows, the wrinkling of her forehead,
the drooping of the corners of the mouth.’
It is the penalty for being an artist; he
must “scrutinise and analyse and define when
it were worthier merely to feel.” This is
Merrick’s verdict; and it is interesting to
hear it from one who is himself so clever
and conscientious an artist. Is he, per-
haps, artist as he is, writing of his own
soul? , „
In his last book, “To Tell You the Truth,
we look in vain for the old mastery. He
has become more sentimental; his comedy
has not quite the old light-heartedness as
when Trissotin and his friends rioted their
way through “While Paris Laughed.” In only
a few of these latest stories is there the old
Merrick —so gay. so melancholy, so sweetly
romantic, so sadly cynical.
C. B. M.
Writing for Pleasure
The question whether an artist writes to
please himself or for the community, raised
by Hugh McCrae and “D.M.W.,” was dis-
cussed a few months ago by Harold Br.g-
house in the Manchester Guardian.
Brighouse pointed out that it was a theory
of Croce that the artist had no sense of the
community, but created beauty simply to
please himself; cited Montaigne and Bunyan
in support: and then criticised the theory.
Bunyan. lie remarked, while saying that he
wrote “The Pilgrim’s Progress” to gratify
himself, sought his friends’ advice about
printing it. “The normal artist’s object in
disciplining himself to technique is to arrive
at the method of making his vision visible
to the greatest possible number.” The artist
has the dream, sees the vision: and, says
Brighouse, if he were satisfied with this “pri-
vate view of beauty” he would stop there and
not trouble to make it visible to others.
Surely, however, Hugh McCrae is right
to this extent, that all fine creative work is
d»ne because there is an inward impulse that
is not primarily or wholly concerned with
the community. “Art for art’s sake” may be
far from being the whole truth, but it is
part of the truth. The artist’s actions are
the product of mixed motives. Something
surges up within him that makes him write
or paint.
I do but sing because I must,
And pipe but as the linnets sing.
During the process of creation he may think
about the community ; probably most artists
do. His concern with his fellows, however,
is greater after his work is done. Then he
wishes his work to be read or seen by the
greatest number. Has there ever been an
artist who, at heart, did not then wish for the
widest possible public? Art is a partnership
between the artist and the community. The
artist supplies the creation, and the com-
munity provides appreciation, stimulation,
criticism. The community has produced the
demand for art, and has helped to shape the
traditions by which the artist is consciously
or unconsciously influenced. Note how when
we are alone in the company of fine art we
long to have a companion who will share
our pleasure. We read a remarkable poem,
and we wish to tell all our friends of similar
taste about it. We see a fine picture, and
we wish to bring all our friends to enjoy it.
What would Robinson Crusoe do if he was
a poet or a painter, and had the necessary
materials? Knowing that there was no
public, would he write much poetry or paint
many pictures?
A. E. M.
Verse-speaking
Oxford University has held a verse-speaking
contest; and judging by the references to it
in three columns devoted to the “Art of Reci-
tation” by the Times the event has been
somewhat epoch-making. The writer of the
article has no doubt that the audience “en-
joyed” the hearing of some of the noblest
English verse from the lips of those who
spoke it. To many lovers of poetry in Aus-
tralia who have come to regard the recita-
tion of verse as a malignant disease, and who
cannot think of an elocutionist without con-
juring up pictures of a person with a rasp-
ing voice mouthing the ragged commonplaces
of our worst writers to an accompaniment of
hand-clapping and encores, the fact that
poetry can be recited in such a W3y as to
give pleasure to a cultured audience may
come as a surprise. Yet this thing occurred
beyond question; and looking fairly at the
matter there would seem to be no good rea-
son why verse should not be spoken in such
a way as lift it again to the place it held in
ancient bardic days. In the Oxford audience
there were 500 experts—not experts in the
sense that they were professional murderers
of the language, but experts in the sense that
they knew and loved poetry, were familiar
with its turns and methods, and possessed all
the feeling for the finer thing the verse-
speaker was attempting to bring forth.
Poetry is really a language within language,
and as such is foreign to the professional
elocutionist; but in the contest at Oxford
there were people who could speak to the de-
sire of those to whom that inner tongue was
native. If sound and not mere written sign
be the basis of language, this should be so.
Reading verse in the silences, we yet think
of its tones and inflections of sound—with-
out that half its beauty and suggestion are
lost. Why, then, should another not be able
to speak for us as we have imagined the
poet himself speaking? To do so he must,
of course, get rid of all the tricks. The
roars and howls must fall to quiet; the
throaty hissing—most admired and detest-
able of all the injurious methods now em-
ployed—must entirely go, and with it the
over-emphasis of vowels, unnatural rolling
of r’s and every other device which is not
wholly natural and honest. The verse-
speaker must first of all understand what he
is saying—understand and feel it—and then
utterly efface himself by trying for no effects
except those actually achieved by the poet
himself. Utter simplicity, complete humility,
perfect enunciation and purity of accent are
the main requirements; and these should not
be so very hard to find. Many a beautiful
voice was intended for just such uses and
is wasted in the general clatter of tongues.
It may seem to some that the lyric poet
at least is beyond representation, that he
sings in an imagined land to an imagined
audience, amid surroundings of a simple
grace and sweetness, and that any attempt
to speak his words to a company in the arti-
ficial surroundings of hall or theatre must
dispel the illusion and destroy the finer effect
of the poetry. I think this is only partly
true; for it is the words themselves that
create their atmosphere, and that atmosphere
need not be lost if they are spoken with sin-
cerity; and understanding. In the absence
of test and experiment everything is mere
guessing; but where Oxford finds success
others may follow. The real trouble in Aus-
tralia is the existing elocutionist; and it is
difficult to see how he can be restrained. That
he greatly vitiates public taste is certain;
but it is by no means certain that poetry-
lovers of purer taste would support real
verse-speaking in a manner strong enough to
put him out of court. In a word, the present-
day elocution is a malignant evil; and real
verse-speaking must be at first a very tender
nursling.
DAVID McKEE WRIGHT.
A Satchel of Books
Sinners in Heaven , by Clive Arden (Leonard Par-
sons, London). Two young people are dumped down
on a tropical island by a misbehaving aeroplane, and
before long it gets to this:
“Love and youth! Warm, tender womanhood ;
manhood in its prime! The very air with its lan-
guorous softness, the radiant beauty all round, every
familiarity of their life together, conspired to fan
their senses to white heat. With the passing of ihe
weeks the spell worked more subtly, more surely,
through their entire being.” ‘
And the result? The publishers had to turn out
three editions in one hsonth
Nuttybub and Nittersing, by May Gibbs (Osbold-
stone, Melbourne), is another of those delightful
kiddies’ books on the lines of the famous “Snuggle-
pot and Cuddlepie.” In inimitable picture and prose
is told a fascinating story of the adventures of some
more of May Gibbs’s own Gumnuts, with the Bad
P f" k / ia o^ en .,, an l.e MrS -r -/V' °l
piece, and all soits of kindly buds and beasts on
the side of virtue. These volumes, which have a
whimsical character all their own, must become Aus-
tralian classics. All of them make ~a n irresistible
appeal to youngsterhood, and there will be no more
popuiar gift-book in the coming Christmas season
than this latest addition to the list.
The Doves’ Nest, by Katherine Mansfield (Con-
stable). By collecting the finished and unfinished
work of his wife after “The Garden Party,” J.
Middleton Murry has done a service to literature,
But about it there is a certain poignancy because
this book gives .a definite indication that Kathe-
rine Mansfield was developing into something greater,
Towards the end she felt she had no flow, that her
attitude towards life needed to be renewed, and the
superiority of some of these stories over her earlier
ones leads the reader to believe that within her own
range—young married folk, elderly spinsters and
young children—her possibilities were limitless. Here,
at all events, with her “Doll’s House” and “Fly,”
she reaches closer to perfection than ever before:
the former is a marvellous flashlight on the ways
of children, and the latter on the crude realities
of existence. Very beautiful, too, are “A Cup of
Tea” and “Taking the Veil,” in the second of which
the scene is laid in the gardens of the Sacred
Heart Convent, in Hill-street, Wellington (M.L.).
Karori, in the-same district, is the setting for “The
Doll’s House,” and one frequently meets the Botani-
cal Gardens, May-street (one minute’s walk from
where she lived as a girl) and the Thorndon Baths,
That she loved the land of her birth is illustrated
by the fact that when she completed “The Garden
Party” and packed it off to the publishers, she sat
down and mapped out the stories for her next
book. Three, had settings in London and the re-
maining six were memories of past days spent in
the Shivery Isles.
More Prejudice, bv A. B. Walkley (bteinemann).
It is good to get this second collection of Walkley s
Times articles between covers. There is nobody else
quite like him writing. G. A. Sala was his only
predecessor of the last generation ; and Sala hadn t
Walkley’s learning. Of course, most of these dis-
cursive papers connect at some point or ether with
the stage. But, then, the Times critic can reach the
stage from any starting-point and by almost any
road. And what he has to say by the way is always
entertaining; and often it is illuminating, partly
because he has the most definite opinions and will
express them. For example. Thorndike played
Charles 1., and in the Times notice of the play Walk-
ley remarked that he was “slow of speech.” ‘ Quite
right,” wrote a correspondent ; “Charles was slow of
speech.” That was quite enough to set Walkley go-
ing : “The correspondent’s argument that the actor was
‘right’ in reproducing in the Charles of the drama a
certain peculiarity of the Charles of history is a
symptom of a by no means uncommon confusion be-
tween history and drama, which it may be worth
while to look into.” We look to history for truth,
to the drama for beauty; and the conclusion of the
whole matter is that “whatever Charles’s infirmity of
speech may have been, it does not absolve an actor
delivering blank verse on the stage from the actor s
primary duty of easy and fluent elocution.” So he
leads us willingly from blackbirds and the right way
of cooking potatoes to the canons of dramatic art and
criticism, and the problem whether it was art for
Oscar Asche to employ real Chinamen in “East of
Suez.”
“Iford”: Norman Campbell’s informative article
on “Slang-” (R.P. 27/9/ v 23) supplies fresh evi-
dence that in the rhyming argot of Cockaigne, silly
and vulgar as it may be, is the key to many a
cant phrase otherwise utterly unintelligible. I sug-
gest, however, that the writer is wrong in his con-
jecture that “screw,” as a variant of “look,” is
possibly a rhyme to “view” ; the more generally
accepted version among students of the vernacular
is that “look”’ first became “screw-and-hook” and
then the usual abbreviation followed. At the same
time I have to thank him for elucidating “Old
Dutch,” which was current London slang for a wife
years before the late Albert Chevalier made it the
title of a song. “Old Dutch” has always had me
guessing; but the information that the endearing
term “missis” became “bread-and-cheese-and-kisses”
(a synonym in which I can’t help finding a poetical
flavor), with “cheese” for the obvious contraction,
dears up the mystery.
“8.C.F.”: There is nothing more iniquitous than
a baseless generalisation, unless it be an inapt,
unrepresentative quotation. Such controversial wea-
pons should find no place in the honest critic's
armory. If I may insinuate myself into this dis-
cussion of Nietzsche’s thought, I must hasten to
observe that Mr. Jack Lindsay is in both regards
an offender of the first magnitude. His criticism
of “C. McL.’s” perfectly valid indictment of the
apostle of Force is a complete misrepresentation yf
Nietzsche’s position. For instance, Mr. Lindsay
denies the existence .of any essential connection be-
tween Schopenhauer and the creator of the Über-
mensch. Even an elementary knowledge of modern
philosophy is sufficient to discount that statement.
For Schopenhauer the will to live was the first law
of human nature, and human action was ruled by
it. Nietzsche, developing this conception, substitu-
ted the will to power. “The only reality,” he says,
“is this, the will of every centre of power to be-
come stronger.” Mr. Lindsay calls this a “morality
of laughter” ; Nietzsche himself styled his thought
that of an “immoralist.” Love, reason, faith,
charity, Christianity, idealism —all are, for Nietzsche,
forms of weakness. He talks of the “plebeian con-
cern” of the English reformers “for the greatest
happiness of the greatest number.” In his system,
of course, democracy had no place. The strong
would rule and the weak would be enslaved. He
forgets the pathological fact that the unrestrained
license allowed to the super-man leads, as with the
Caesars, to degeneration and real weakness. He
forgets much more —he forgets that the true end of
life is conquest of self, not of others. Of Mr. Limi-
say’s brand of philosophy, Tolstoi said: “In spite
of all the shame the confession costs me, there
was a time when I tried to look as if I was satisfied
with this sort of thing!”


Why fade at 30?
YMPROVE a woman’s appearance and
I you improve everything that she does.”
Every woman knows that nothing is more
true. And that it applies with special force
in the early middle years. Then it is that
a woman moves consciously towards wider
interests, or realising that girlhood is gone,
fades reludantly into the background before
which other women stage their happy and
and successful lives.
But while a woman grows in mental power,
gains poise and balance, her appearance
demands increasing and unremitting care.
She who intends that the joy of life, the
spirit of youth, should not fail her at thirty
years or thereabout, can no longer leave the
welfare of her skin to chance but must care
for it in the best possible way.
Sensible diet will do much to maintain a
clear complexion. But it cannot do all.
Perfed cleanliness is absolutely necessary to
health and beauty of the skin. Ordinary
surface cleanliness is not enough. Only
when the pores are free from every particle
of dust and powder accumulated day by
day, can they fundion as they should.
Palmolive was created to promote this special
kind of cleanliness. And because it con-
tains the valuable natural oils of the palm
and the olive, the lather of Palmolive gently
but surely penetrates the pores, frees them
of injurious accumulations, and stimulates
them to normal healthy adion.
Palmolive is the secret of a clear skin. Yet
what treatment can be so simple, so pleasant,
so safe and —so inexpensive? Palmolive at
a cake is the same incomparable soap
as when it cost considerably more. The
contents, the size, the natural colour and
fragrance are the same. Only the price
has changed. Buy Palmolive to-day. Try
it to night—and keep that schoolgirl com-
plexion.

“Yes, Jim, that little Burroughs Calculator
you see sitting on the desk in front of you,
has saved us a lot of money. We use it, you
know, for figuring jobs that we used to work
out on scratch pads.
“The day the Calculator was left here, I
checked some of our invoices which had just
been figured mentally, and found an under-
charge of a shilling. The mistake occurred
in extending the amount on one of the items
—an ordinary job of multiplication. Just
how often that occurred previously I don’t
know, but we’re sure it doesn’t happen now
because all our invoices are figured with
the Calculator.
“Of course, figuring invoices is only one of the
jobs we do with this handy little machine.
There’s a lot of discounts to be taken, wage
sheets to be extended, costs to be figured
and analysed.
“You’d be surprised how much quicker you
can do this figuring on the Burroughs Cal-
culator. It doesn’t seem to take any time at
all when compared with the old method, and
I know that our clerks appreciate how much
easier the machine has made their work.”
If you have such work as extending invoices,
figuring discounts, wage sheets, costs,
analyses —anything that requires multiplica-
tion, addition, division or subtraction, you, too,
will find the Burroughs Calculator a good
investment. Ask us for a free trial so that
you may give the Burroughs Calculator a
good test on your own work.

The Kitchen of Her
Dreams —Electric.
Electric cooking saves time, money, food,
work and health.
When electric ranges are installed the time
spent in the kitchen is reduced to a minimum.
You twist a switch and the heat comes on to
high, medium or low, just as you require it;
operating without flame, fumes, smoke, soot
or odor. Electric heat does not tarnish shining
utensils or dainty walls.
There are no ashes or coals to carry, no
flues to clean.
Let electricity do the work—enjoy more
leisure hours.
Economy is effected by reduced food
shrinkage.
Insulated ovens permit cooking with
stored heat after the current is turned off;
this heat is kept in the oven, not distributed
through the kitchen.
Foods cooked with electricity retain their
natural flavors and juices.
Eliminate guesswork by securing uni-
formity of heat.

When you and 1 with Death
Go strolling at the last,
We’ll linger to take breath
And scan the road we’ve passed.
You’ll say, “There on a day
You kissed shy little me,
Nor guessed our love should hold its way
Through all eternity.”
And I shall say, “My dear,
So sweet the road we’ve trod,
I’m glad to know the time is near
When we shall melt in God.”
Then we with Death shall pass,
Both smiling at his haste,
My lips upon your lips, my lass,
My arm about your waist.
And mighty suns that day
Will be specks in the foam
Of Love’s transcendent tide. He’ll say,
“Dear children, welcome home !”
So shall we stay with Him
Beyond regrets and dream,
And watch unnumbered ages swim
Like bubbles in a stream.
Yet always as they pass,
Love’s sweetness we shall taste,
My lips upon your lips, my lass,
My arm about your waist.

(AFTER HEINE.)
Where in vale or parched drouth-land
Shall my lifeless body bide"?
’Neath the palms in sunny south-land
By the river’s stately tide?
Shall I rest in desert dreary
Buried by a stranger hand?
Shall the sea enfold me, weary,
To her bosom in the sand?
Ah, what matters? Heav’n up yonder
Will surround me there as here,
And as funeral lamps will wander
Nightly stars above my bier.

Spring on The Barrier.
Though very beautiful is Spring
Along the coastal land,
With scarlet flower and scarlet wing,
And green on every hand ;
Though beaqh and breaker glow and gleam,
And lit are all the ways,
’Tis of another Spring I dream,
Back in the bygone days.
A score of years have passed away
With all their tears and bliss,
And yet it seems but yesterday—
So fresh and sweet it is!
Red fruitage of the quan dong-trees,
Green leafage, soft and new—
Though radiant be the morning seas,
My heart goes back to you!
Once more that vanished Springtide fills
My dreams with joy and mirth;
Once more Spring walks the ancient hills,
The oldest rocks on earth.
For, ages since, grey aeons gone,
Ere yet, in time withdrawn,
The builders built in Babylon,
They towered againgt the dawn ;
Sun-scourged and seamed by many rains,
And scalped by breeze and blast,
Weird, brown and green, they front the
plains.
Gaunt relics of the past.
But, ho! Spring’s miracle is such,
And such her artist-powers,
That wmking at her gentle touch
They laugh in golden flowers.
From sun and soil and sleeping seed,
To clothe them, gaunt and old.
With patient hand and kindly heed,
She weaves a cloth of gold.
And this she spreads on root and stone,
And ragged ridge and bare.
Till one may see, not age alone,
But youth and beauty there.
The track-tired drovers, burnt and brown,
The men from Back o’ Bourke,
Who travel where the sun goes down.
They know, and bless her work.
Clear azure arching o’er their heads,
Through velvet airs they pass,
While on the barren routes she spreads
A carpet of green grass.
Though life be charged with many ills.
And burthened be their backs,
A sense of space and beauty fills
These riders on the tracks.
For weary men with weary eyes
Will draw their reins at whiles,
And drink the peace—the calm that lies
On endless saltbush miles.
And often grief that sours the breast,
And shame that wounds and scars,
In midnight moments are confessed
Unto the priestly stars.
For Spring, who makes the air like wdne,
And the fancy wings,
Draws down the stars until they shine
Like big, familiar things.
And thus it is. when city lamps
On wall and pavement glare,
The man who knows the western camps
Walks ever head in air.

THE PUBLIC SERVICE VOTE.
In one of its rare introspective - moods the
Queensland Labor Government discovered
the other day that it was employing 36,068
citizens and paying them just about two-
thirds of the public revenue. There are
11,280 in the cuff-and-collar departments,
20,871 in the railway service and 1175 in
other State enterprises, while 1395 get their
living, with the aid of American loans, from
what are styled “mining operations.” In
the mass they collected last year £8,411,590
in wages and salaries; the revenue from all
sources was £12,599,403. And that per-
tains only to the State Government. The
Commonwealth is also a large employer of
Queensland manhood and womanhood. There
are 3339 persons in the Postmaster-General’s
Department in Queensland, 180 in the Cus-
toms, 279 in the Taxation Office and many
more in Home and Territories, Treasury,
Repatriation, Public Works, Health, Navi-
gation and Defence, although without a
special return (there is no geographical divi-
sion of jobs in the latest Estimates) it is
impossible to get at the exact number. In
addition, hundreds of so-called temporary
hands whose names never figure on the
official lists are employed by both State and
Commonwealth on taxation and electoral
work and the like (some of these “tempo-
raries” hold their billets until their teeth
drop out), and in time of political excite-
ment thousands more find toil, or what
passes for toil, on Government loan-jobs in
doubtful electorates. Nor does Theodore’s
enumeration include the employees of the
Brisbane Tramway Co., recently “nation-
alised” by compulsion, or the 72 paid mem-
hers of the Legislative Assembly. A cautious
estimate is that 45,000 adult Queenslanders
live and have their beer by doing something
useful or useless for the Government. And
for every person so employed there are
doubtless two others (females mostly) suf-
ficently interested in his fortunes to judge
a Government by its kindness to him, or the
. contrary. That makes 135,000, all with
votes. And the Commonwealth Registrar
could find only 405,941 electors in Queens-
land when he revised his rolls at the end of
last year.
A delegate from Theodore’s State told the
manufacturers assembled in conference at
Perth that he had found the Labor Minis-
ters “sick and tired of Government trading.”
Sick and tired they may declare themselves
in private conversation, but on the hustings
they pipe another tune. Then they raise
the cry that if the party in Opposition got
into power it would dispose of the State
enterprises “and throw all the employees out
of work.” Thereby they compel the party
in Opposition to reply that it -will sell the
enterprises, in which event every man there-
in employee? and all his adult relatives will
vote for the crowd in office, or—as is most
likely—that it won’t sell them. The result'
in either case is that the general body of
citizens is oppressively taxed for the upkeep
of a lot of seedy experiments in State
socialism, which have no economic right to
be on the earth. The same vicious system is
at work in other branches of Government
employment. Thousands of able-bodied Aus-
tralians are engaged in such tomfool occu-
pations as enrolling the same elector two or
three times, blistering him with two lots of
taxation-papers and assessments, collecting
the same statistics twice over, and so forth.
Everyone knows that it. is the very delirium
of folly, but reform is blocked because the
two major parties, are mortally afraid of
offending the Government “servants” —their
massed vote can easily turn an election. In
eight years of Labor-socialistic rule Queens-
land. the fairest portion of the Commonwealth,
has become a land of Government employees,
pensioners, recipients of unemployed relief
and clients of the State Charities Depart-
ment —a land where industries which used
to be immensely profitable are only kept
alive by Government grants, loans, bonuses
and guarantees. And the condition of N. S.
Wales, which has also pursued the policy of
finding a job “under the Government” for
every pertinacious individual with a vote and
a pal in Parliament —though not to the
same extent nor for the same length of years
—is little better. Cooks, the Treasurer,
made that clear in the dolorous Budget he
presented last week. Depressed by the
weight of an accumulated deficit (now
£2,774,000) and a mounting interest bill (it
will be £616,000 more this year) Cocks
gloomily declared that a reduction of income-
tax was out of the question. Yet the impost,
that can’t be reduced because the Govern-
ment’s necessities are too great is notoriously
burdening industry: it is a fact that the
lowest rate in N. S. Wales on incomes from
personal exertion is the highest in Victoria.
*** * *
The Ma State’s latest financial worry is
its superannuation scheme. These “schemes”
have become fashionable of recent years:
framed, as a rule, by public servants for
public servants, they make their appearance
just before a general election, and ire
rushed through complaisant legislatures in-
tent, for the most part, on buying the public-
service vote. That was the case with the
proposals which the Hughes' Government
embodied in a hasty bill a month or two
prior to its Waterloo, which were estimated
to cost the taxpayer 41 millions in 20 years
(it already becomes evident that the esti-
mate will be greatly exceeded), and which, in
an excess of generosity at other people’s ex-
pense, the Government made retroactive for
two years. The N. S. Wales scheme, having
been gloriously misunderstood by the Gov-
ernments administering it, has got into an
appalling mess. Last year Cocks made the
following announcement;—
An item that has been omitted from the expendi-
ture this, year (1922-23) is a contribution of
£348,000 to the Superannuation Fund. The Govern-
ment is satisfied that its contributions to the Super-
annuation Fund have been based upon excessive
calculations, and that for several years the annual
amount allocated has been over-estimated. It will
be perfectly safe to omit this item from the Esti-
mates. for this year, and in all probability to adopt
the same course next year.
The gentleman has now discovered that
superannuation ran the taxpayer into
£703,951 in 1920-21, and £722,906 in 1921-
22, and that had there been a contribution
last year on the 1921-22 scale it would have
amounted to £766,809. Also ■
Unfortunately, these figures do not reflect the true
cost to the State of subsidising pension schemes; that
cost is considerably greater. I am advised by actu-
aries specially engaged to investigate the position
that the State’s full annual contribution—if that
contribution were determined in the light of the
actual ascertained cQ«t and made on sound prin-
ciples instead of. postponing to the future contri-
butions which, should be paid year by year-—would
be well over £2,000,000.
Which is a mild way of warning the tax
payer that he may presently be paying £1
per head of population per annum for the
superannuation of civil servants. And it
should be taken as a warning of something
more—the grave danger that the public’s
servants may completely tyrannise over
their employers. Less of the blame for that
is attachable to the service than to the party
politicians. Instead of regarding the people
in the pay of the State as patriotic citizens,
the party politician has viewed them as per-
sons prepared to sell their votes to the high-
est bidder. It is this bidding and outbidding
which is responsible for most of the expen-
diture on unprofitable loan works that weigh
so heavily on the shoulders of every Austra-
lian community. The public-service vote —
including, and, indeed, particularly, the vote
of the army of casual workers who live on
loan jobs—is the Frankenstein which democ-
racy has created; and sooner or later we
shall have to wrestle with it, by the segre-
gation of that vote or otherwise.
THE THIN END OF A FASCIST
WEDGE.
Many Australians who are unfavorable to
the Bolshevism of Russia pin their faith to
the Fascism of Italy. One is Mob. Law and
the other Martial Law, and from the stand-
point of a freedom-loving people there is no-
thing to choose between them. In a very
literal sense they are blood-brothers. Rus-
sian Bolshevism has given birth to the rule
of the Fascists Lenin and Trotsky, while
Mussolini already appears to be weakening
in his hold on Italy, and so threatening the
nation with a Bolshevik uprising under a
rival dictator. Why any sane people should
look to either doctrine for that internal peace
without which a community must remain
in a chronic state of nerves and insolvency
is a mystery that can only be explained by
specialists in war neurosis. But there the
phenomenon is, and the politicians are mak-
ing all possible use of it. Fascism can be
achieved in other ways than by the organ-
ising of bands of doggers, just as bloodshed
is not essential in the early stages of a re-
volutionary movement. The Red army has
its Pussyfoots like the army of Cold Tea;
and the doctrine of peaceful penetration has
often been put into successful practice by
despots in embryo. A striking example of
the steady effort which is going on in reac-
tionary circles here to increase the sway of
the official (and Fascism is, of course, no
more than an exaggerated form of official-
ism) is afforded by a bill which has just been
drafted for N. S. Wales Attorney-General
Bavin. It is a whole sermon on one of the
most dangerous tendencies of the day.
For some time past authoritarians of the
Bavin type have been noting with displea-
sure the large proportion of acquittals in
the criminal courts. One explanation may
be that the Crown Law officials are not doing
their job. It is, at any rate, certain that
over and over again alleged malefactors are
charged on the most trivial grounds, and
in the Heaydon matter,
which finally collapsed last week —on no
grounds at all. However it may be, the
voice of Authority has proclaimed that this
dangerous leniency has got to be stopped.
Hence the Bavin bill. It provides for an
amendment of the Crimes Act, making, it
compulsory, in all criminal charges involving
property to the value of £lOO or less, for the
accused to be summarily dealt with by a
bench of two magistrates. The first effect
of this change, if Parliament translates it
into law, will be to take away the right of
trial by jury from perhaps 80 per cent, of
those accused before the criminal courts.
Few thefts, burglaries, embezzlements or
forgeries are to the value of over £lOO, and
where the contrary is the case it is the usual
practice to frame, the charges sectionally.
Assuming the Crimes Act is amended in the
direction proposed, it may be safely. fore-
casted that, in any doubtful case (which is
to say, in the very class of case which it
is most desirable for a jury to try),.the in-
dictment will be drawn so as to bring the
accused before a Bench. For benches of the
Sort indicated will be far more liable to con-
vict when wanted to than present-day juries
are to acquit. Even the best of N. S. Wales’s
magistrates may be said to have the convict-
ing habit. As ex-C.P.S.’s for the most part,
they have been intensively trained to it. In
the capacity of criminal Judges with abso-
lute powers, they will be under no delusion
as to what an administration of the Fuller
type expects of them, and they will act
accordingly if they care about their posi-
tions. The Judges who at present preside at
Quarter Sessions, etc., are irremovable ex-
cept by a vote of Parliament; magistrates may
be taken from the Bench at a word from the
Minister. The machine will, of course, be
liable to w T ork both ways, after the habit of
all such jerry-built contraptions. With an
autocratic Government which is in power
largely on Tory support, the disposition will
be to show severity; with a “humanitarian”
or Labor Government Sikes will have a
chance of escape, even where, his offence has
been more or less clearly established.. In
other words, political caprice will begin to
sway many of our criminal trials. Magis-
trates will be liable to look kindly on the
slips of political bosses or their friends; and
it may be that corrupt men will be appointed
for the protection of corrupt Government offi-
cials. There is plenty of that kind of work
in the U.S.A.. where the small-salaried Judge
wielding relatively enormous powers is com-
mon.
Our jury system calls for improvement;
but no British community is going to assist
the cause of law and order by emasculating
it. And when it comes to substituting trial
by Government-appointed officials for trial
by jury, a situation promises to be created
which will teem with possibilities in the way
of trouble. Rightly or wrongly, Australians
have imbibed with the culture of Britain the
Briton’s conviction that for all-round pur-
poses of justice and equity—two quite dif-
ferent things—the average jury is the most
reliable instrument available; anyhow, in
criminal trials. Rightly or wrongly, when
the average jury gives its verdict the average
citizen is prepared to accept the same, and
waste few tears on the victim. This is a
priceless convention for the purposes of
orderly government. And there is reason as
well as tradition at the back of it. Many
a brilliant Judge—a profound lawyer, may-
be. and a master of the language—is not to
be compared as a judge of character and
motives with some of the petty traders to
whom he addresses his summing-up. Reveal-
ing flashes during the trial that were as
clear as day to them may have been lost on
him. He has sacrificed in the very effort
that brought him to the bench an essential
attribute in one who aspires to weigh human
nature —the common touch. The public un-
derstands this, and is keenly suspicious of
attempts to place unchecked powers in the
hands of men who, by training and tempera-
ment, are often in sore need of the check
which is represented by the jury system. —
an arrangement under which the Judge in-
terprets the law while the citizens in the box
attend to the facts. The reactionary theory
at the back of the Bavin bill is that high
officials do not need to be checked and con-
trolled in the same way as mobs. The his-
tory of the last few years alone is sufficient
to prove the fallaciousness of this idea. Dic-
tators resemble beggars, inasmuch as they
are often perfectly respectable pei-sons until
they are put on horseback. Once in sole
charge of the steed they are more than likely
to ride it to the Devil, and the same applies
to virtually uncontrolled officials, more
especially when they happen to be Judges.
The police-court magistrate, exercising sum-
mary jurisdiction in a place where 95 per
cent, of the accused are admittedly guilty of
the trifling offences alleged against them, is
a necessity if this side of the public business
is to be done with reasonable expedition. A
Judge sitting without a jury may be emi-
n.cntly suited to deal with many classes of
C * Vl ij a ? eS| antl is right that the parties
should have the option of dispensing with
juries in such circumstances. But for a
sort of judge-magistrate to be compulsory in
the vast majority of criminal trials is an out-
rage on one of the first principles of freedom,
and the Parliament that agrees to a prece-
dent of the sort will be sowing the seeds of
discontent and disorder.
YOKOHAMA’S DAYS OF TERROR.
V\ .S.lL’s picture of Yokohama in the
days of terror:—
111 the Japanese press, or ut least that portion of
11 remains after the recent calamity, there
apppeared the following cable through the Kokusai
agency:—
hJ J *£ <lol k Sept ' I( i —4 very warm tribute is paid
by the Observer i u its editorial columns to the
courage and patience with which the Japanese people
nave borne the overwhelming disaster, and to the
indomitable energy with which they started to
lestore the ruins. The paper expresses, doubt as to
whether anj- Western country could have rivalled
the speed at which confusion resulting from the
catastrophe was controlled.
It is difficult to say just how much of this is from
the Observer and how much is the work of the
Kokusai. That semi-official Japanese cable agency is such
a frequent distributor of inspired messages that, were
it not for other cables of a similar tenor, one would
be inclined to discount the whole of it. As it is,
we are led to the conclusion that some newspaper
writers have a eommendably tender spot in their
hearts.
The Observer is served by exactly the same semi-
official agency as, say, Kobe or Osaka (Reuter is
represented in Japan by Kokusai), and residents in
these ports were for a week or more in a fog as to
what the strong hand of authority was doing. Little
did they know that the powers behind that hand
were in an even deeper fog, and only awoke and
stirred when they realised that almost a squadron
of foreign destroyers were in Tokyo Bay, and that
warships were steaming up from Manila, Hongkong
and other stations along the China Coast to do the
job. On the evening of September 6 there were
more foreign war vessels anchored in Yokohama har-
bor than Japanese, and up to that date, and even
later, there were more foreign steamers acting as
refugee relief ships than Japanese, despite the few
foreigners concerned as compared with natives.
These steamers had in many cases been withdrawn
from their regular courses by their captains on their
own initiative. There was a job to be done —and
they proceeded to do it promptly.
Foreign passenger ships and freighters, more
especially the French mail s.s. Andre Lebon, the
Canadian-Pacific s.s. Empress of Australia, and the
U.S. Shipping Board s.s. President Jefferson, had
been rescuing and feeding refugees, while Japanese
steamers in the harbor had pulled up their gangways
rather than allow themselves to be invaded. And
now the possibility of British and American sailors
showing the way was the lash which stirred to life
again that very efficient; navy of .Japan. Marines
were landed and given something better to do than
wander round sight-seeing as heretofore; pinnaces
were put to better use than to swing in their davits.
But many valuable days had been lost, and much
damage had been done when the idea of posting
pickets gradually dawned. Yet the festering dead
in the streets were still suffered to remain apparently
forgotten. Their presence was made known in a
most offensive way to all but the authorities; but
there they were permitted to lay polluting the city air
and poisoning the water. So much was heard of
the Japanese Red Cross services at the time of the
Russo-Japanese War that it is difficult to understand
the incredible slackness shown in Yokohama’s catas-
trophe.
Returning to the Observer’s editorial, it is but
fair to mention that, however warm the tribute paid
to the courage and patience of the Japanese people
may have been, it could hardly have been adequate.
As a whole, excluding the scum which rises to the
surface on such occasions, and the escaped prisoners,
they behaved magnificently. If only relief had come
more quickly, and some of those steamers on the spot,
in a position to render assistance had acted with
more promptitude and less regard for regulations,
they could have saved so much of the pain and
misery which the homeless people so little deserved.
'The earthquake taught that the people of Japan can
face adversity with courage, but just as surely did
it teach that the mechanism of government control
has grown unwieldy through the old principle of
Tokugawan restrictions too excessively applied. For
days invaluable relief facilities which could have
been offered by Japanese naval and merchant vessels
remained unavailable on account of the absence of
instructions from headquarters. The fact that head-
quarters had in all probability been temporarily
wiped out, and that it was a ease of every person in
authority acting on his own initiative, seemed to
strike very few.
In the absence of any adequate military-police con-
trol on shore, Yokohama became a hotbed of crime
and a rich hunting-ground for criminals. She
always had her fair share of bad characters, but
on this occasion it was augmented by the escape of
hundreds of criminals from the Negishi prison situ-
ated on the outskirts of the city. Safes and strong-
rooms were looted, injured men were foully murdered
the more easily to relieve them of their valuables,
and the pockets and persons of the dead were rifled
even in daylight. Highway robbery at noonday was
too frequent to cause comment. Inoffensive Koreans
were hunted far into the hills, and even battered to
death on the Bund, right under the eyes of the
guarding warships a couple of hundred yards or so
off shore, on the mere suspicion of being guilty of
incendiarism. It is highly probable that some of
the Koreans indulged in looting and other crimes,
but if such was the case the innocent were made to
suffer with the guilty when the rumor spread, and
when the mob, already half-crazed with grief and
terror, started the horrible man-hunt. Not until
five days after the calamity did Yokohama become
comparatively safe, and during those five days lost the
only “indomitable energy’’ shown amid the ruins
was by looteTS, who tackled every exposed safe in
the foreign settlement.
Facts regarding the looting, murders and general
horror of those first days, and more especially the
attitude of the populace towards Koreans, are being
strenuously suppressed, and the publication of
accounts by eye-witnesses leads to the speedy sup-
pression of the offending journal. The whole has
been officially declared to be based on false rumors;
and no doubt the ever-obliging Kokusai has made
due emphasis of this in its outward cables. The;
indescribable crimes of those black days and nights
can, however, not be hidden. There are too many
to bear witness to the horrors. The official machinery
seemed smitten with a palsy. On Thursday, Sep-
tember 6, five full days after the disaster, I made
a trip from the Bund down to Yokohama station, a
distance of a mile and a half, and then a wide detour
back again, I- passed, during the whole of that
walk, no more than four armed sentries guarding
the Customs sheds, two detachments of pickets
bivouacked among the ruins, and a rice queu«j


guarded bv soldiery. The streets were thronged
with homeless people, all threading their way
through the ruins, and stepping aside to avoid the
dead lying stretched just as they fell. Even six,
seven, eight days after the earthquake, these almost
or quite naked bodies, bloated and stinking after
the heat of the September days, lay untouched. The
few foreigners remaining in Yokohama had made
an early attempt to gather their dead: so also had
a few Japanese. But, generally speaking, they lay
unheeded in the streets; they choked the foul
canals; they floated backwards and forwards in the
harbor with the tide, until this city became one
mass of corruption, and even aviators flying above
the ruins complained of the foul smell. And so
things remained until the danger of an epidemic was
realised, and systematic steps were taken on the 10th
instant (assisted by American bluejackets) to gather
the dead.
LONDON AND THE DAY’S WORK.
When Prime Minister Bruce, in saying
pleasant tilings to liis hosts of the City of
London, remarked that London's struggles
for freedom had inspired the whole Empire,
lie was speaking a great mystery about which
history is curiously silent. The citizens of
London very easily asserted their rights,_ and
their organised numbers made those rights
tolerably safe even in the deepest darks of
the Middle Ages, An occasional Lord Mayor
stood up for some privilege of the city
against a king and easily won his way ; and
even as late as the time of George . the
power of the corporation was sufficient to
enable the chief alderman to definitely take
up the cause of the Queen against her royal
husband. All the Saxon kings, with their
capital at Winchester, were a little afraid
of the big city; William the Conqueror
did not dare to enter it after his victory at
Hastings, but pitched his camp at Berkhamp-
stead and played a waiting game. The place
was really an integral State, and tolerably
independent of the kingdom.
Archaeologists are not agreed about the am
tiquity of the city ; but the balance of modern
opinion seems to favor its British origin;
and there is almost proof that London Bridge
existed prior to the Roman Conquest. After
the Romans withdrew its history is again
in doubt. Older historians believed that, for
a period it lay in ruins; but this again has
been almost disproved. It seems more likely
that London alone maintained some sem-
blance of Roman order in the general chaos,
and that the early fighting Saxons were
afraid to attack it. This would mean —-and
probably does mean—that the city remained
during the early Heptarchy in laws and in-
stitutions a British republic, the one un-
murdered garrison of the Romanised Celts.
Later on it acknowledged the king who was
for the moment strongest as long as he did
not interfere with its citizens. The first
actual charter of its liberties was granted by
Richard I.; and it is of interest that it was
the citizens of London who paid most of his
ransom. All through the Middle Ages it
grew 7, glittered and prospered. Every king
show r ed it his spoils of wuar; its days of
public rejoicing were plentiful, and street
processions were its favorite form of enter-
tainment. In all the long years, London,
perhaps the oldest and richest city of North-
ern Europe, possessed its freedom and stoutly
asserted it. There was no need to put up
a fight with any Government over the matter.
The point that Prime Minister Bruce
chiefly missed, however, is that London,
largely self-governed and unobtrusively inde-
pendent, though in the main quite loyal to
the broader England around it, is the pro-
totype of all the free Dominions. Even Queen
Victoria must descend from her carriage and
knock for admission at the Temple Bar, thus
fully acknowledging at so late a date the
liberties of the city; yet tens of thousands
now living can remember the love, amount-
ing almost to adoration, of Londoners for
this same Queen who must not trespass un-
bidden within their boundaries. The knock-
ing at Temple Bar was a mere form ; but it
was the memory of something which was not
a mere form. A Saxon king might have
knocked there and kicked his heels with ini-
patience, knowing that there was room for
reasonable doubt as to whether the gate
w 7 ould bo opened or not. Most of the kings
of Plantagenet times took care to be popular
with the citizens. It was a dangerous place,
though seldom a troublesome one. Even
Richard 111. had enough support from pro-
minent Londoners to prove that lie must
have treated the place reasonably well; and
it seems fairly established that the trial and
death of Mary Queen of Scots were- pur-
posely delayed for sheer dread of the indig-
nation of the city. William 111. detested
London because the smoke got into his lungs
and interfered with the growth of his tulips:
but it advanced the money for his wars, and
finally its merchants established the Bank
of England, which was really the bank of
London. All the time the surrounding coun-
try was maintaining an entirely separate
and utterly different life. Remnants of the
feudal system stayed on in counties as near
as Berkshire and Kent until the late 18th
century ; but the Commercial Age, which his-
torians represent as beginning at the end of
the Wars of the Roses, had really been in full
swing in London at least a thousand years
earlier. The trade conquest of the world,
which is now 7 so fully acknowledged, is in
plain fact a conquest of the world by the
London idea.
But a free city could not exist by merely
being a free city. It could not grow 7 grain
in its cobbled streets, nor raise beef in its
narrow back yards. The real London of the
big, asserted freedom was a hive of artisans.
It lived by toil, and its moral triumph w 7 as
its pride of work. Outside London the
worker ivas a thing for contempt, the tiller
of the soil a villain, in the speech of his
masters; inside the old w r alls toil was hon-
ored in the highest degree. The Worshipful
Company of Carpenters still eats dinners of
regal magnificence in memory of the days
when a man who drove a nail well w 7 as
really worshipful in the city. The price of
London's freedom was eternal vigilance, no
doubt; but in a far more real sense payment
was made for value received in solid work.
If Bruce, in addressing the aldermen, had
caught up that idea and elaborated it. his
remarks might have been better worth their
space in the cables. London, the prototype
of the free Dominions. w 7 as built on the solid
foundation of a good day's work. Is it too
much to believe that a free dominion can
only exist on a similar foundation to-day?
The rights of man in a vague and general
sense make good talk for a vote-seeking poli-
tician. In reality man has no rights—never
had any rights—except those that he pays
for. The readiest coin of payment is the
good day’s work, which _ from _ the hands
and brains of all its citizens is the real
charter of a nation’s liberty,

PLAIN ENGLISH.
The Only Way.
History repeated itself when, at the Austra-
lian National Federation Conference, which
began in Sydney on Monday, the N. S.
Wales National Association proposed the
deletion of the clause of the party
platform providing for the maintenance
of an Australian navy and the inser-
tion of a clause providing that Aus-
tralia’s naval defence should take the form
of co-operation with the Imperial Navy.” N. S.
Wales, the home of the “Dreadnought” move-
ment, was the last State to stand out for the
arrangement under which the Commonwealth
hired its sea defence at a rate which barely
paid the British squadron's annual paint
bill, and it is not surprising that the'same
State and the same bogus Imperialists should
be the first to call for a return to the old
order of things. A passion for cheapness,
even in such a vital national concern as de-
fence, goes with the Freetrade religion which
N. S. Wales Conservatism has never entirely
lost. But. the position is ominously different
from what it was when, the It.A.N. was
borne to these shores on a wave of genuine
national and Imperial fervor. Then the
Labor party was in favor of an Australian
navy: now it is officially hostile. N. S.
Wales Conservatism talks of "co-operation
with the Imperial Navy,” but in its heart
it favors the miserable policy of our inter-
nationalists—that of talking high-minded
idealism and leaving others to do the paying.
In practice it will never be possible to get
the taxpayers of Australia to contribute
adequately to the R.N., and the Tories know
it as well as the revolutionaries. The design
of both sections is to gamble on the con-
tinued readiness of the taxpayers of Britain
to provide the defence of this country virtu-
ally free of charge. In practice the only con-
tribution of value that can be expected of
Australia to an Empire navy is an Australian
navy. (The principle may be tested by pic-
turing the response which would be made by
any self-respecting Dominion to a suggestion
that it should hire one of the English county
regiments'for its land defence.) An Austra-
lian navy, however small in its beginnings,
might be organised, as the C.M.F. is, so that
in time of need it could immediately become
an integral part of the Imperial defence
scheme. Its ships could be exchanged for
training purposes with R.N. ships, as Aus-
tralian and Imperial army officers are now
exchanged. Once the doctrine of a self-
defended Australia was established as un-
cballengeably as that of a White Australia
(and the second is a subject for derision with-
out the first), the arsenals, the shipbuilding
yards and the bases would come of their own
accord, and with them an increased popula-
tion. Meantime, it is as much Australia’s
duty to pay its modest share of the Singapore
base scheme as it was for the Commonwealth
Government to pay for the material with
which the A.I.F. (and, through the A.T.U.
Australia) was protected and provisioned in
France and Palestine.
♦
The Commonwealth Bank.
The Prime Minister did a great dis-service
to the Commonwealth Bank when he hurried
off to Europe without settling the affairs
of the institution. Even during the lifetime
of Denison Miller, the first Governor, it
became increasingly evident that it was
undesirable that absolute control should be
in the hands of one man. Upon his death
there was practically no division of opinion
on the subject. The only question was as
to the shape of the new control. A Board of
some sort was inevitable; but should it con-
sist of officers of the bank, giving their wfflole
time to its affairs, or should outsiders be
called in? The suggestion that officers should
constitute the Board —and there was a
strong body of opinion in favor of this
policy—made practically all the senior
men in the service competitors for the few
seats available. In such circumstances there
were bound to be rivalries, with at any rate
suggestions of cabals and intrigues. The
position even of Governor was in the melt-
ing-pot : Deputy-Governor Kell had in the
ordinary way succeeded as Acting-Governor,
but there was no obligation upon the Minis-
try to make his appointment permanent—his
qualifications would no doubt come up for
consideration along with those of any others
who might be candidates. The internal
dissensions thus produced or intensified have
already resulted in the retirement of the
Chief Inspector from tin l service : and thus
one candidate, at any rate, is apparently out
of the way. assuming that the Board is
chosen from within. The Acting-Governor
may have had good grounds for accepting el-
even instigating the Chief Inspector's
resignation ; but in the circumstances it is
most unfortunate that there should be no out-
side body upon which he could call for help
in determining a matter of such extreme
delicacy. The trouble that has occurred —
the press propaganda in favor of this or that
officer; the bad feeling which has obviously
been produced—points to one thing: the un-
desirability of keeping control wholly within
the service of the bank. This paper saw
much in favor of that plan ; but the occur-
rences of the past few months have plainly
suggested that the safety, smooth working
and success of the bank will best be served
by bringing in the right men from outside.
And it would be just as well for that Board
to really know something of the inside of the
institution before any permanent appoint-
ments are made consequent upon the death
of the original Governor. Whether it has
been well or ill managed the public does not
know, and under present conditions can-
not know. Certainly large profits have been
made ; but there were extraordinary facilities
for the making of large profits. And there
ought to be not only a thorough inquiry into
past operations and methods, but a settled
policy for the future. At present there is
none. What, for instance, to put the mat-
ter in the simplest possible terms, is the
purpose of the Commonwealth Bank? So
far as this paper knows, even that much has
never been determined.
Legalised Extortion.
Visiting Queensland recently, Willis, gen-
eral secretary of the Coalminers’ Federation
and president of the N. S. Wales division of
the Labor party, mentioned that the latest
industrial wrangle on the Maitland
(N.S.W.) field cost his union £165,000. That
amount was actually expended in the struggle
for freedom, as freedom is understood by the
young lions of Labor; the wages sacrificed
in pursuit of the same article totalled a great
deal more. The admission is enlightening
as to the ways of those controlling these big
industrial organisations and the financial re-
sources thereof —resources which, organised
for constructive and not destructive purposes,
would be a considerable factor in the econo-
mic development of Australia. For £165,000
or thereabouts Willis’s Federation could
have bought a coal-mine and set out to prove
the contentions of its journalists and mob-
orators that the nefarious capitalist can be
done without. When the Labor aldermen ran
Sydney they said they could get a coal-mine
for £75,000, and were with difficulty re-
strained from purchasing at that figure,
although experts valued the proposition at
£5OOO. But nothing is farther from the
thoughts of Willis and his associates than
backing their collectivism with Federation
funds. Never tired of arguing that the
mines should be run by the miners, they care-
fully avoid demonstrating that even one mine
can be so worked. Not for them to persuade
the community by the success of an experi-
ment in which their owii money is ventured
that the socialisation of industry (which
they expect the community to finance) is
practicable: they would rather squander
£165,000 on a dud strike and injure the
community in the process. In the same in-
fatuated spirit did the A.W.TJ fool away the
price of several good sheep-runs, and provoke
thousands of secessions from its central
branch, by resolving not to shear under the
1922 Powers award. When Willis re-
turned to Sydney he boasted to a Sun re-
porter of “the success of my mission in
Queensland,” as evidence of which he “dis-
played a bank draft for £9OOO in favor of
the Federation.” The methods by which this
money, or some of it, was collected clamor
for the attention of Commonwealth legislators.
At the half-yearly meeting of the Queens-
land Colliery Employees’ Union, which is
affiliated with the Federation, the president
said in Willis’s presence that “anybody will
admit the Maitland men made a mistake.”
To support the persons guilty of this “mis-
take,” the Queensland coal-miners, who had
not been taken into the gentleman’s confi-
dence, were ordered to contribute large sums
from their infrequent wages (even Willis
admits that they have been suffering from
“intermittency of employment”), namely, 15
p.c. of eight pays and 74 p.c. of two pays, with
reductions when the Maitlanders con-
descended to go back to work. Some of the
victims protested against this monstrous ex-
tortion. One, sued at Ipswich, engaged a
barrister to test the lawfulness of the busi-
ness. and Willis gave evidence against him.
Ruling that he had jurisdiction, and the
Federation authority to prosecute, the P’.M.
made an order for the payment of £4 19s.
to Willis’s organisation and £2 2s. to its
lawyer, “in default distress." Legally, the
decision is doubtless right; morally it hasn’t
a leg to stand on. The Commonwealth Par-
liament has committed many follies in mat-
ters industrial, and allowed many blows to
be struck by tyrannous blatherskites at the
liberty of the subject, but it surely never
contemplated that a Queensland miner,
obliged to join the union before he can get a
job, might be sold-up for refusing to subsi-
dise a work-stoppage, about which he was
never consulted, on a N. 8. Wales field. Or
that a Gascoyne (W.A.) boundary-rider
might be imprisoned for a debt incurred with-
out his knowledge or consent because some
A.W.U. organiser, flown with insolence if
not beer, has worked up a political strike in
Tasmania. Federation of unions is a fine
thing for head-office officials hungry for jobs
in Parliament or ambitious of posing as the
local Lenin or Trotsky, but a very bad
business for the members of small, remote
branches w'ho value a quiet life. For the
protection of such unionists Parliament
should decree that under no circumstances
may strike levies be extorted from them un-
less their branch has voted beforehand in
favor of the strike. There would be fewer
of these wicked and destructive industrial
disturbances if that were the law.

Railways under Socialism.
The Theodore Government continues to
demonstrate the futility of the State Enter-
prise nostrum to make a State happy and
prosperous, by presenting its railways to a
wondering universe as the champion money-
losers and deficit-breeders under the Southern
Cross. In 1912-13 (Denham regime) the
excess of earnings over expenditure (exclud-
ing interest) was £1.170.681; in 1913-14 it
was £1,288,761. The following year it rose
to very nearly L} million. Under Labor
management the amount available for pay-
ing the interest bill has fallen away to
£344,168 for 1921-22 and to £706,138 for
1922-23. The Auditor-General’s report
states that for the past ten-year and five-
year periods (from July 1. 1913, and July
L 1918) respectively
5 years. 10 years.
Earning’s increased by .. 34.70 p.c. 03.18 p.c.
Expenditure increased by 38.24 ~ 119.17 „
Naturally, Under a system which allows ex-
penditure to increase nearly twice as rapidly
as revenue, things turn out a bit unsatis-
factorily on squaring-up day. “Return on
capital invested,” says the Auditor-General,
“for the financial year ending June 30,
1923, amounted to £1 7s. lOd. per cent, to
meet an interest charge of £4 6s. per cent.”
But little facts of this kind don’t dismay the
Theodore Government particularly, for the
Queensland Premier only the other day an-
nounced his intention of spending five mil-
lions of loan money during the current finan-
cial year. To do him justice, he also said
something about a sinking-fund of £200,000
per annum; and when a Labor leader pro-
poses to pay back annually about l-25th of
what he proposes to borrow, the Labor
journals shriek applause from every quarter
and hail him as statesman. But the most
striking summary of the Queensland railway
position is contained in the subjoined little
table
1912-13. 1922-23.
Net earnings per employee.. £B3 14 6 £4l 18 8
This huge tailing away is partly due to the
increase in the number of men employed
(2856 more in the 10-year period), partly
to the ‘’go-slow” habit, and partly to the
continual building of fresh, non-paying lines
for political reasons, and disguised under the
specious name of “development undertak-
ings.” Railway loan moneys cost, more and
more every year, and the £4 6s. per cent,
mentioned above will probably be £5 6s. per
cent, when the renewals of the next two
years are completed; but still the Depart-
ment will go on presenting the same old dis-
mal shortage to the public, irrespective of
consequences. If the Theodore Govern-
ment desired to sicken Queenslanders of the
very name of State Enterprise, it could not
follow a better course than it is taking.
The Anti-Immigrant Campaign.
Almost any day Australian newspaper read-
ers may find in one of those sheets which
prefer apocryphal offal to reliable news, a
wounding attack on a shipload of British
immigrants. Not a protest against the con-
duct of a few, but a general assault on the
character, habits, language, health, cleanli-
ness and all-round decency of everybody on
board. The evidence for the prosecution
is usually supplied by “an elderly passenger
who prefers to remain anonymous. This
wary moralist has a story to tell which, with
immaterial variations, has been retailed by
one or two dirty-minded scandal-mongers of
every ship’s complement since sea-travelling
began in a big way. The immorality, night
and day, is described as appalling. Drinking
and gambling were rife. The language was
unfit for chaste ears. And so on. All it
signifies is that floating hotels —microcosms
in which the world is to be seen at close
quarters—are no place for persons who have
the peering habit, with which invariably
goes a practice of exaggerating the naughti-
nesses seen, and inventing others which the
peerers failed to identify but conscientiously
believe to have been prevalent. At Sydney
Quarter Sessions a few days ago serious,
not to say, hideous allegations were made
against some of the men employed at Cocka-
too Dock. They were not whispered to a
newspaper reporter, but were stated on oath
in the witness-box. As to the general body
of Dock employees, the Judge said that “a
shocking state of affairs existed among
them,” and the jury requested him to bring
under tire notice of the authorities that.
“Cockatoo Dock was not a fit place in which
any respectable child should learn a trade.”
If there were any bona fides in the moral
capers of the garbage press this verdict
would, surely provide a text for some effective
sermonising. All that followed was silence.
If the Australian public imagines that such
unfair discriminations go unnoticed in Bri-
tain —the country that supplies us with our
loans and our defence —then it is even more
infatuatedly foolish than its worst detrac-
tors claim. The Cockatoo workers well ap-
preciated the damaging nature of the general
criticisms passed on them, as was indicated
by the mass meeting of protest they imme-
diately held. The Judge's comments and the
jury's rider cast a slur on every employee
at the Dock, and similarly the charges made
by the papers cast a slur on every man and
woman aboard the ships that are aspersed.
The migrants are not in a position to organ-
ise- united protests, but. they can, and no
doubt will, warn their friends not to risk
the Australian trip if they value their repu-
tations. This will not prevent immigration
(the press campaign is, of course, merely a
method of pandering to those who want Aus-
tralia kept as empty as possible) ; but, apart
from considerations of decency and sports-
manship, it will have the effect of afflicting
us with settlers who have so little self-
respect. and so little character to lose, that
they are indifferent as to what is said about
them.
A Small State’s Finances.
After funding a £350,000 deficiency a year
ago Treasurer Lee. of the Speck, ended the
past financial period (to June 30, 1923) with
a deficit of £298,461, and expects to finish
On June 30, 1924, with a shortage of
£355,000, exclusive of the losses (probably a
quarter-million) on soldier settlement. That
is. even if Parliament agrees to the Govern-
ment programme of retrenchment and new
taxation, the Treasurer “confidently antici-
pates” that this year will add another
£57,000 to the existing deficit. The accumu-
lated shortage of revenue over expenditure
in seven years of Lee's Government amounts
to nearly a million pounds. Nearly a half-
million has been got rid of by the simple
expedient of adding it to the public debt,
and by all appearances the other half-million
will have to be “settled” by the same method.
The public debt is now within a fraction of
£23.000 000, and the interest and sinking
fund payments for this year will amount to
£1,008.791, or nearly half the total revenue
of last year (£2.174,0001. This year’s re-
venue is estimated at £2.336,000, an increase
of £162.000 on last year's, but the estimated
expenditure. Lee declares, cannot be cut
down below £2.600,000. This is £llB.OOO
more than last year's. Interest alone, owing
largely to the Government’s unpleasant habit
of funding its deficits, is responsible for
nearly all the increase. To partly mend this
unhappy state of affairs, or. at least, to
“show willing,” the Government proposes to
impose fresh taxation to the extent of
£192 000. A new income-tax bill is to be
put through. This measure, in addition to
making provision for the collection of Com-
monwealth taxes through the State Taxation
Department, will “at the same time,” sayh
Treasurer T ee. “give the State an oppor-
tunity to collect revenue from sources which
the State has not previously touched.”
These include profits on sales of property, $
per cent, on dwellings used rent-free for resi-
dence, and disallowance of 5 per cent, unim-
proved land-value and Federal land-tax. The
tax on the profits off land sales is expected to
net £10.000: the 5 per cent, on residences,
£8000; discontinuance of allowance hitherto
made to Tasmanian income taxpayers of 5
per cent, of the unimproved value of their pro-
perties, and the wiping out from the deduc-
tion list of the amount paid in Federal land
tax, is expected to realise £25.000: three-
pence extra on companies, £16.000; deceased
persons' estates, £11.600: land-tax increases

(over £2OOO unimproved value), £31,000;
and increased rates on individual taxpayers,
£91,000. It is proposed to charge fees to
pupils of State high schools and junior tech-
nical schools; to charge municipal bodies fees
for compulsory Government audit of their
accounts; to levy inspection charges on
fruit; to abolish the Agent-General; to in-
duce the Commonwealth to take over the
.State shipping line (loss last year, over
£40,000) ; to pass the control and financing
of hospitals over to hospital districts; and
to reduce the number of members of Parlia-
ment. And when (or if) this programme
gets through the legislature, the shortage on
the year’s operations will be at least £57,000.
As it will be 1920 before the Hydro-electric
Department can hope to show a profit, and
as the railway loss of £200,000 a year,
largely caused by motor-traction competi-
tion, is more likely to increase than decrease,
and as the interest bill cannot possibly grow
less by effluxion of time, the Speck’s outlook
is pretty blue. So blue, in fact, that Pre-
mier Lee can see nothing ahead of him but
a trip to the Commonwealth’s back door with
a pathetic request to “gibbit tickpence.” At
the bottom of all the trouble is the interest-
bearing debt represented either by unprofit-
able undertakings or by nothing at all. In
a large and expanding population the curse
which this sort of finance implies takes a
long while to come home to roost. But the
home-coming sooner or later is inevitable.
Tasmania is in its present difficulties, not
because it has been more reckless than
others, but because it is small and has wit-
nessed no growth of population to keep pace
with its growth of debt.
e
A Chance for Righteousness,
Major-General Rosenthal. M.L.A., gave
the Sydney Millions Club the encouraging-
assurance last w r eek that the Chief Secretary
would shortly receive a deputation of women
and leading churchmen “with a request that
financial provision might be made for satis-
factorily dealing with sufferers from the
social plague.” The speaker stressed two
points which have repeatedly been made in
The Bulletin
The Venereal Diseases Act has been relegated to
obscurity; it has not been allowed to function be-
cause the Minister concerned thinks that if it were
to function it would alienate a large section of
people who voted for the Government, Half a mil-
lion pounds were spent on lunatic asylums, yet, de-
spite the fact that the trouble of a big percentage
of those in the asylums was directlv traceable to
syphilis, only a paltry £5OOO was 'placed on the
estimates to deal with venereal disease.
It is well that women and representatives of
the churches should be interesting themselves
in this scandalous state of affairs, since they
stand for the two classes that are chiefly to
blame for it. The R.C. Church has never
taken any useful part in v.d. prevention in
Australia. As for the others, one or
two clergy of the Rev. R. B. Hammond
type interested themselves in the founding
of the N. S. Wales branch of the Australian
Association for Fighting Venereal Disease:
but as the declared objective of this branch
was no more than to “disseminate accurate
information as to the prevalence and effects
of venereal disease,” they might almost as
well have l’emained uninterested. It is im-
possible to dispel disease by talking about it.
Australia’s representative women have
always been hostile to practical v.d. reform.
Mrs. Atkinson, one of the chief speakers of
the N. S. Wales Society for the Protection of
Women and Children, has inveighed against
the examination of suspects and other mea-
sures which she would probably agree were
sound in the case of possible plague sufferers ;
and Mrs. James Booth, of the Victorian
Association to Combat the Social Evil,
objected strongly to Dr. James Barrett’s
recent demand for “suitable legislation bear-
ing on the notification, treatment and preven-
tion of venereal diseases.” It may seem
strange that the churches which inculcate
morality should not grasp at every possible
chance of lessening the incidence of v.d..
which, by continually swelling the nation’s
army of neurotics and morons, is responsible
for so much immorality. Strange, too, that
righteous women should imagine they are
assisting the feminist cause by giving their
fallen sisters a virtual license to remain dis-
eased, and are aiding the cause of the children
by ensuring polluted parents for thousands
yet unborn. But these strange phenomena
have to be interpreted in the light of that
unreasoning thing, the “religious” mind. In
other ages the possessors of this type of men-
tality burned people for their sins: nowadays
some of them are pleased to let sinners rot
by way of punishment. Under the party sys-
tem of government administrations are ex-
tremely nervous of these fanatics, who, by
their misguided sincerity, are capable of in-
fluencing votes to an extent which is out of
all proportion to the rationality of their
theories. It is no exaggeration to say that
if the women and the churches agreed to
put their weight behind a genuine scheme of
v.d. reform (not a campaign of platitude-
mongering, but a logical move towards
disease-eradication on scientific lines) Aus-
tralia might be made the cleanest continent
on earth inside 10 years. The medical pro-
fession has the knowledge requisite to en-
able it to abolish the curse that is causing so
much anguish, misery and crime: it is only
awaiting the word “go” from the authorities.
But the authorities which depend for their
jobs on votes will not speak till the people
whose hostility they fear intimate that they
are at last ready and eager to see a serious
assault begun.
The proclamation of a Rhenish Republic is
the prelude, apparently, to the collapse of
the German Confederation. Bismarck’s
colossal edifice rested on unsound founda-
tions from the beginning, as was shown in
the hatreds which developed between Prus-
sians, Bavarians and Saxons during the war.
The collapse on the Kaiser’s home front,
which, as every German commentator has
agreed, gave the _ Allies their victory, was
only another manifestation of the same prin-
ciple at work. The German tribes united
in the first place chiefly for loot, and, realis-
ing now that their ambition is hopeless, they
have no bond of use, tradition arid common
tastes to hold them together. So the Euro-
pean balance of power appears destined to
pass again, as it so often has done since it
was first upset by the fall of Carthage. Ger-
many, in the event of victory, had intended
to annex France’s eastern provinces, and by
the imposition of an illimitable indemnity
make another war of revenge impossible.
Belgium and Holland were to have been
absorbed, and the path opened for a deatli-
grapple with Britain for the latter’s over-
seas possessions. The securing of the hege-
mony of Europe by France—a stay-at-home
nation of officials, peasants and small indus-
trialists —will mean a far less ambitious
foreign and colonial policy (Germany's
avowed aim, eventually, was to defy the
Monroe Doctrine, and dominate South
America), and this must mean peace. The
overthrow of the balance of power always
has meant peace for the duration of the
accursed device’s collapse, just as, in a busi-
ness, there is little or no friction with a
strong man, who knows his own mind, at
the head of affairs.

A note from a'Canadian journalist:—
A close knowledge of Canadian political conditions
is required to appreciate. the lukewarm attitude on
Imperial defence questions of the Canadian Prime
Minister, Mr. W. Mackenzie King, and his fellow-
delegates to the Imperial Conference. King was
selected leader of the Liberal party, which is ,now
in power in Canada, because of his war attitude.
As the only English-speaking Liberal of any promi-
nence who opposed conscription, he was the only
politician in the running for the leadership of hi's
party who was acceptable to the strong French-
Canadian wing. His election as leader meant almost
inevitably his elevation to the Prime Ministership;
for the Government (a combination of English-speak-

ing' Canadians) had imposed compulsory military
service on the hostile French-Canadians. Having
won the war, the English-Canadians fell apart, and
many supported the Progressive party (farmers),
which now has more members of Parliament than
the former dominant Conservative party. The Pro-
gressives are hopelessly divided from the Conserva-
tives on matters of domestic policy; and there is
thus no possibility of the Liberals being ousted in
the lifetime of the present Parliament. The Liberals,
dominated by the French-Canadians, will not spend
a dollar on the defence of the Empire. When they
go a different tale may be told. Meanwhile, all
that can be hoped for is tariff concessions, to which
both Liberals and Progressives are wedded, for the
British exporter. There is little danger in this for
the Canadian industrialist, for, securely entrenched
as he has been for years in his home market, his
position is secure. Australia and Maoriland will
thus, when it comes to the point, be the only
Dominions who will do anything to strengthen the
British position in the Pacific.

From the president of the Immigration Study
Commission (of America) :
Has the “white-anting” of the British' race in Aus-
tralia commenced with the beginnings of immi-
gration of Mediterranean races, as into Queensland?
Dare an American, son of an Australian and grand-
son of one of your pioneers of the ’forties, tell you
cut of his society’s study of America’s depressing
experience with polyglot immigration, that such
“white-anting” has begun, that you must be alert
if you would prevent disaster ?
ou are evolving an Australian type of man-
hood, of womanhood. What it could do was demon-
strated in the Boer War and in the World War.
‘ hat type is one of humanity’s most precious assets.
If you can hold your race-strain pure until your
five millions can become the ancestors of the future
Australia’s hundred millions, your force for world
democracy will be almost irresistible. At the
close of our Civil War (1865) we too were evolving
another pure Anglo-Saxon type, the American. To-
day, through admitting 17,000,000 of the Alpine
and the Mediterranean races, who outbreed the Nor-
dics, which includes the Anglo-Saxons, we have
a polyglot nation which might have been pure Nor-
dic. As a dramatic example of the lowering of our
ideals we came into the World War in 1917, not in
1914. As a life-long student of world problems,
including immigration, dare I suggest that, had out-
weight bee t added promptly in July, 1914, to that
of Britain’s, the Hohenzollerns would have paused ?
You do not want Australia’s splendid future
blighted through polyglot immigration, such as is
beginning to “white-ant” Queensland. The Medi-
terraneans breed like rabbits. Here is our American
experience:—
Ist 2nd 3rd 4th
Genera- Genera- Genera- Genera-
Birth-rate. tion. tion. tion. tion
A tp 1 jo-Saxons 3 9 27 81
Mediterraneans . . 7 49 343 2301
Even the second generation had “white-anted” the
fisheries, the fruit stands, the candy and soft-drink
shops. They were taking over, not onlv the hotel-
waiter jobs, but the ownership of small restaurants.
The “white-anting-” of tram labor was following
their crowding out of our Anglo-Saxon miners over
large areas. Then such groups as our society aroused
public opinion. By legislation we have partly
stopped them. They are being turned, therefore,
to Australia. But no Australian city wants, as m
the writer’s home town, a “tenderloin” district
ruled by “Mediterraneans,” with jury bribing of
Latins by Latins, and with a Mediterranean lan-
guage spoken in the jury-box to defeat the ends
of justice.
Will you not find it wise to preserve Australia
for your own Anglo-Saxon descendants by similar
legislation ?

“Flicker" : Perhaps the decision of Poole,
J., in the recent bigamy case in Adelaide
referred to in several Bulletin pars, lately,
will do something to emphasise the need for
a uniform marriage law for the Common-
wealth. At present the whole matter is
chaotic, especially with regard to what con-
stitutes bigamy. According to “Kenny on
Criminal Paw,” honest belief in a spouse’s
death will relieve the other party from crim-
inal responsibility if he or she marries
again and the Enoch Arden business' re-
peats itself. Of course, the second “mar-
riage” is a dud in such a case. But “there
may be cases of undoubtedly criminal big-
amy where there is no moral guilt at all.
For both parties may have been misled by
some very natural misapprehension of the
law. The great and increasing dissimilarity
between the marriage laws of civilised
nations has made it but too easy for people
to be man and wife in one country yet not
in another.” It’s bad enough to have dif-
ferent laws in different countries, but it’s
far worse when they conflict in different
parts of the same Commonwealth. For in-
stance, if a person marries in S. Aus. within
three months of getting a decree absolute,
he may, it seems, marry again elsewhere
without fear of consequences—so far, any-
how, as the law is concerned. But if he does
his first re-marrying in Vic. or N. S. Wales,
then there will be a bigamy charge ahead
of him should be try another lot.
“llambone” : Easily the most significant
statement which has come from the U.S.A.
for a long time is that of Edwin Denby,
Secretary of the Navy, when christening the
giant dirigible ZRI. Said he:—
Any enemy of the United States that invites a
trial of strength with this country will have its
hands full. We expect to equal, and surely hope to
surpass, all others in military aviation.
Not quite two years ago a clarion call from
W ashington for nations to disarm set a glow
in the hearts of peace-lovers and imparted a
roseate hue to the dreams of international
idealists. All that the Disarmament Confer-
ence did was to remove a source of weakness
from Uncle Sam’s defence system; whatever
pause it brought in the mad race’for arma-
ments favored him. With a few thousand
miles of Atlantic seaboard to defend from
European attack, and an equal amount of
1 acifie coast to protect from the menace of
Asia, Samuel realised that, no matter how
much money he poured down the sink of
naval construction, he could never make
himself quite invulnerable against attack
from the sea. Hence a conference in his own
capital which concentrated on a reduction
ot naval armaments. The two countries
which suffered most from the decisions of
the V ashington Conference were Britain
and Japan—two geographically small island
1 owers whose chief means of defence —hot
aggression—were warships, the implements
of attack most feared by Uncle Sam, In
what direction Yankeeland turned for ’de-
fence when he achieved his desire for reduc-
tion in naval armaments is now clearly de-
monstrated by Denby’s announcement' of
ABI s use in the event of war. The giant
dirigible is sustained in flight by the non-
inflammable gas helium, thus removing the
handicap which made the terrifying Hun
Zeppelins less successful than they should
have been. It performed a 12-hours’ cruise
at a high speed which so satisfied experts
that there is talk of it, with a sister ship,
maintaining a peace-time trans-Atlantic mail
service. Denby himself described it as the
latest perhaps the most terrible —weapon
ot offence. There is a lesson to Australia
here. Defence-Minister Bowden recently
gloated over his department’s acquisition' of
two VV ren ’planes, which, he announced,
were the latest development in aviation.
Actually, the “Wren” is a toy.
The , situation in the United Kingdom
doesn’t change, except that to-day’s news is
worse than yesterday’s, and is generally
better than to-morrow’s. The other day
the number of unemployed on the official
registers was 1,222,000, and the number of
their dependants was a matter of guesswork.
Everything wearable that France sends over
seems to be 20 per cent, below the British
minimum, and German cutlery is said to. be
not much more per dozen than the British
single article. France and Germany don’t
°, n eac b otlier > oor on the U.S., for
all three have tariffs to meet the case; but
-h reetrade Britain is everybody’s easy mark,
ihe farming interest reports that “every-
thing is grown at a loss,’’ and by way of a
new departure it is proposed that the Gov-
ernment should guarantee something like ss.
per bushel for local wheat. And even 5s
doesn t seem much in a country where the
tenant pays the police rate, and school rate
and poor rate, and road rate, and lighting-
rate, and general rate (in fact, the rates are
m T th i!‘ tlle rent )> and also has
a landlord and an Established Church o n his

if the farmer could get it. Meanwhile, Aiis-
tialia depends on the harassed John Buhl
country to buy its wheat, and loan politicians
such as J. Mitchell, of W.A., are urging it to
go on the land, and grow more wheat like the
on r John Bin t J ncideiltal -; v ’ * also depends
on John Gull to renew its loans. Either

a tight-rope balancing act.

POLITICAL
POINTS
The selection of Massy Greene for the late
Millen’s seat in the Senate would go down
better if the N.S.W. Nationalists hadn t be-
haved with such rank ingratitude to Garling,
their “fastest unplaced” candidate in 19U
and again in 1922. Also, if they hadn t
squealed so much when the Progressives nomi-
nated Colonel Abbott, who polled 1 3,000
primary votes last year—more than any
other candidate except Millen and
McDougall. Considering that the Gnashes
(1) departed from their own precedent m
rejecting Garling, and (2) believe —at least,
they say they do —in preference to returned
soldiers, they should have been the last to
squeal. There is a notion that .Greene is
destined for a place in the Ministry once
he has got the hang of things in the Senate.
He would certainly be an improvement on
Pearce.
In N. S. Wales last year the State expen-
diture was £35,454,844; and for the current
year it will be £37,263,890, according to the
Treasurer’s estimates. In 1912 it was
£16,137,279- so there has been an increase.,
of over 100 p.c. in 10 years. The Treasurer
wrings his hands and says he is helpless-
most of the increase has been due to fixed
charges,” which means interest and the like.
It isn’t wholly true; but if it were, the obvi-
ous course would be to see that there wasn t
a preventable increase in these fixed charges.
Instead of doing that the Government is
going ahead merrily building up those
charges still higher. Past year the loan ex-
penditure was £10,758,000, and in the past
three years £38,000,000. This was just about
equal to the whole amount of the loan appro-
priations in the 15 years 1885-1900, and that
period included the boom which smashed most
of the Australian banks.
Massy Greene being out of the running
for a seat on the Tariff Board, that appoint-
ment is likely to go to James Mackinnon
Fowler, sometime M.H.K. for Perth. Fowler,
an honest Scot, was Hughes’s keenest critic
on their side of the House in the days of
the dictatorship. His refusal to truckle to
the little potentate, and his annoying habit
of telling the truth and shaming the Devil,
infuriated the Perth National Federation,
and in the end it got his scalp. As chair-
man of the Public Accounts Committee
Fowler did useful work for the Common-
wealth in disinterring the facts (such as
were then disinterrable) about the Hughes
Government’s sugar purchases and war-ser-
vice homes bungling. That was part of his
offence.
Until Friday of last week no one had
been expelled from the N.S.W. Labor party
for nearly a fortnight. Weary of this in-
action the A.L.P. execxitive has cast out its
Communists, Howie, Garden and the rest.
The Communists are expected to retaliate
by placing the A.L.P. executive under the
ban of the Third Internationale, by which
fell edict, among other pains and penalties,
it will be deprived of the privilege of sub-
scribing to the Russian loan, particulars of
which have been brought to Sydney by a
hopeful gent, from Moscow. The A.W.U.
will probably rise to the occasion by declar-
ing both factions bogus. , And so the thing
will go on till all the gassy exponents of
the brotherhood of man have expelled one
another. Then everyone will be satisfied.
When N. S. Wales Treasurer Cocks was
juggling with his first Budget (14/9/22) he
said this: —
We are making no provision, even of the most
inadequate character, in regard to a sinking fund. ■..
The sinking fund is an essential, and, if it should
be my task to present another Budget, I will endeavor
to demonstrate in practice the theory I now put
forward.
But when the other Budget arrived, which
happened last week:—
It is to be regretted that as long as an accumulated
deficit is brought, forward from year to year the
sinking-fund payment to the State Debt Commission
must remain a formality.
And the gentleman stumbled on to the next
subject. Westralia has had deficits since
1911, but has kept its sinking fund going all
the time. Though not the best sort of finance,
it is more honest than that of Cocks’s Gov-
ernment, which spent £10,758,000 of loan
money last year (£12,232,000 was played up
in 1921-22) without paying a penny into
sinking fund. But they are all alike, these
N. S. Wales, Treasurers—maximum of pro-
mise ; minimum of performance.
On a sort of civil war :
Rallying from the shock it got when its leader
was expelled from the Labor party, the Bailey fac-
tion is asserting its authority again in N.S.W.
machine politics. It is in supreme control of the
biggest branch of Australia’s biggest union, and as
such it issued a mandate last week that Lang, the
alleged Labor leader, and Loughlin, his offsider,
should appear before it. They hastened to obey.
Many attempts have been made from within the
“TATTSMANIA.”
“Speaking on the Budget in the Tasmanian Assembly, A T. Marshall said the iinances were in
a desperate condition. If Tatt.’s tickets were 6s. each instead of 58. 10d. people would still buy them,
so they might as well take the odd twopence and make it even money. On last year's figures tha:
would amount to £51,000.”
THE POLITICIAN: “Look here, girlie, I’m broke again. You gotter give me a bigger rake-
off, see! Put a bit more acid on your gentlemen friends — they’ll stand it!”
A.W.U. and outside to get rid of “the clique,” but they
have all failed. It is unshiftable; it controls all the
wires in the organisation, and its agents are paid
out of Union funds. Plain unionists, who have to
work for their living, have neither time nor oppor-
tunity to fight their bosses. It is now war to the
knife between “the clique” and the A.L.P. executive
which expelled Bailey. The odds are on “the clique.”
There are some unutterably stupid persons
in the Mothah of Australian Parliaments.
In December, 1921, when Garling and Grant
were up for Pratten’s seat in the Senate,
two honorable blockheads messed-up their
ballot-papers. Last week, with Greene, Dunn
and Abbott to choose from, three dull dogs
bungled the simple job of voting in the order
of their preference. One can understand
now why a certain type of N. S. Wales poli-
tician sourly resents the suggestion that he
should pass an education test.
Cocks, the N.S.W. Treasurer, mentioned in
his melancholy Budget that the State tram-
ways were run at a loss of £107,000 in 1922-
23. This should be interesting to the Queens-
land Labor Government, which has expro-
priated the Brisbane Tramway Co., and is
now engaged in an expensive legal argument
as to whether the purchase money should
include an allowance for goodwill. With the
motor-'bus conquering everywhere, a Gov-
ernment which gaily acquires a tramway sys-
tem in a spreading city clamorous for exten-
sions, and regardless of whether they will pay
(very likely they won't), engenders doubts
as to whether it is fit to be at large.
A note from a N.S.W. western town :
The establishment of a motor freight service be-
tween Bathurst and Sydney has produced the un-
usual spectacle of railway employees solidly backing
up the Commissioners in the attempt to defeat this
form of competition. Threats have been made that
if local storekeepers patronise the new method of
getting their goods from the city, a boycott of
their shops will be instituted amongst unionists.
It is deplorable, of course, that traffic should
be taken from the State lines; but this isn’t
the w r ay to meet the situation. A boycott
to drive people to patronise the railways
simply means that, on top of all the regular
taxation, an irregular tax or blackmail is
now to be added.
In reply to the complaint that the Speck
Government’s new taxation proposals, if
adopted, would make Tasmanians the most
tax-burdened folks in the Commonwealth,
Treasurer Lee points out that at least 18s.
p.h. of the State's revenue is derived from
Tattersall’s sweeps and is. mostly paid by
speculators outside Tasmania. According to
Lee direct taxation in the Speck is not more
than £2 10s. 6d. per head. Though the actual
position has been mentioned often enough
before, chiefly by Oppositionists, this is the
first time a State Treasurer has been honest
enough to discard Ministerial “diplomacy’'
and frankly admit that the Speck lias been
getting a lot of revenue “on the side,” so
to speak.
Had there only been a betterment tax on
the land which is being made to soar in value
by the Sydney city railway, that expensive
proposition might easily have been made to
pay. A block facing Wynyard-square which
will be opposite the station has just had
£lOOO per foot offered for it. The vendors
don’t consider it enough, and are holding out
for more. Handsome fortunes have been
handed to landowners and speculators who
have acquired property in the vicinity of
Liverpool-street and the Town Hall, lhe
added values could easily have been preserved
to the people, to whom they rightfully belong
—it is they who will have to foot the bill.
South Aus. has received notice that the
Commonwealth is going to exercise its option
of taking over the existing southern frag-
ment of the South-North railway, from Port
Augusta to Oodnadatta. The deed can’t be
done without a year’s warning, and Harwell's
Government hopes it won’t be done at all,
except as part of a plan for carrying the line
through to Darwin.
The cynic might get great joy from reflect-
ing that in Queensland, where the Labor
party has thrown out members (including
various Ministers) wholesale for going slow
on the Socialist programme, the Labor voter
almost unanimously went slow on the same
programme at the Prohibition poll, and the
Trades Hall actually sent out a call to the
workers to put State control second. Sup-
pose the excommunicated leaders now meet
and formally excommunicate the rank and
file, including the Trades Hall.
Baiting Allan, Old and Wettenhall, three
of the Cocky Ministers in the Vic. Composite
Cabinet, is a frequent sport of the Labor
members these days. They don’t do it
viciously, but with an adroitness that shows
up the amateurishness of the trio. Lawson
and Peacock, who viewed the comedy from
the Ministerial corner benches the other day
when Allan was the victim, looked as if they
were detached spectators. In contrast to
this baiting was Labor-leader Jones’s praise
of Hon. (Liberal) Minister Cohen, K.C., in
the Uppah Chambali for the masterly way in
which he handled and whisked through the
’Varsity Reform Bill in one sitting. And
Cohen deserved it.
The building of the North Shore Bridge
will do the State Government a trifle of good
by sending up the value of certain land in
Berry’s Bay. When David Berry died he set
aside the interest on £lOO,OOO for the main-
tenance of a hospital at Berry, the little
South Coast township which grew on part ot
the 90,000 acres of the Berry Slioalhaven
estate. The Government some years ago
contracted with the trustees to take over the
liability in exchange for 88 acres of land
at Berry’s Bay, in Sydney Harbor. The
deal didn’t look a particularly good one at
the time, and it has cost the State a few
thousands every year since; but the value
the bridge will put on the property makes it
look a trifle less unpromising now.
An Australian Forest League is on the
stocks, its purpose being
To link together societies and individuals interested
in forestry, agriculture, etc. ; to assist in creating a
“Forest Consciousness, ’’ thereby educating the public
to a realisation of the value of forests and to the
necessity for their protection and extension ; gener-
ally to work in the interests of the Tree ; and especi-
ally, through the School branch, to educate young
people on these lines.
The president in N. S. Wales, where the
League begins its being, is Chief Forestry
Commissioner Hay; S. H. Smith, Director of
Education, is one of the vice-presidents; and
F. T. Berman, of the Five Dock School, and
a leading spirit in the Teachers’ Horticul-
tural Society, is the hon. sec. There is
work of vast national importance waiting for
the league to do ; and the half-crown which
annual membership costs can be safely re-
garded as a small contribution to good Aus-
tralian citizenship.
While the N. S. Wales Assembly was
expressing its hostility to titles, the Min-
istry was putting the finishing touches on
a list of 2000-odd J’s.P. Cann, whose col-
leagues made a few thousand of the tribe in
their time, might move for the abolition of
another silly business. Foreign titles,
absurd as they are, necessitate the purchase
of some sort of ironmongery or frippery,
which means that a bit of currency circu-
lates : but the newly-made J.P. doesn’t even
furnish a job for the maker of a dog-collar. It
was a N.S.W. .Judge who remarked when
a new brigade of beaks turned up at Dar-
linghurst to be sworn in, “Good gracious!
What are they all charged with?” The
old tipstaff’s opinion as to what some of
them ought to have been there for has never
been published.
THE BABY’S BUN.
[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
“Sir Philip Lloyd-Greame refers to Sir John
Simon’s prediction 'that Imperial preference will set
British housewives against the present Government
a s ‘the bogey of the baby’s bun.’ ”
Shall Britain purchase from her kin
And let Mildura’s products fruity
Past as they can be shipped come in
Without a stiver of Customs duty?
It marks a new Imperial' phase,
Blends sense and sentiment in one;
But see the higgling Simon raise
The bogey of the baby’s bun!
Where Bull's concerned, in war or peace,
Haven’t we a record somewhat finer
Than all the greasy Greeks in Greece
And all the Turks in Asia Minor?
Are we not countries bound in ties,
For weal or woe, approached by none?
But larger looms in Simon’s eyes
The bogey of the baby’s bun.
When aught we sell or buy is bought
Or sold, shall trade be but a bicker
For farthings? Kinship go for nought
And blood than water be no thicker?
An Empire, ours, from shore to shore
On which there never sets the sun,
But some can hardly see it for
The bogey- of the baby’s bun.

For many years down to DID paid capital
had remained stationary at £400,000. At
July 31 it had increased to £097.027, and
will have reached £700,000 when unpaid
calls come in. Though the latest £lOO,OOO
issue was flowing in during practically the

cently, there are good prospects of the div.

off for depreciation, though as plant and
machinery are regularly reported to have
been “maintained in a high state of efficiency,
and all expenditure in connection therewith
has been defrayed out of current revenue as
heretofore,” there is some doubt whether the
"depreciation” allowances are not something
over and above actual requirements under
that head. Probably they are; brewery cos.
generally are notorious for socking away
profits against contingencies. Assaults on
the beer trade are so frequent that their
managements must make provision against
the worst. Lately the N. S. Wales Parlia-
ment has again had the liquor trade under
review; this time it has been decided to hold
a prohibition poll in 1928, but as the bogey
of no-compensation has disappeared the
breweries have little to fear even should the
Ma State decide to go “dry.” Meanwhile
the Licenses Reduction Board is wielding the
axe right and left, and though its operations
may cut into brewery interests the cleaning-
up of the liquor trade is the best assurance
of its continuance. The breweries are them-
selves a good deal to blame for the periodic
attacks on them : had they combined years
ago to Dull out the undesirable features of
the business, and concerned themselves with
the conditions under which their brews were
retailed to the public, they could have posed
as lily-white saints conducting a clean and
legitimate trade. Instead, they have been
forced by a multitude of Acts to reform the
conditions of their retail trade.
Even when the future of the liquor trade
was looking its blackest Tooiiey’s showed no
concern. From not quite £400,000 in
breweries and pubs eight years ago, at the
latest balance the book value of those assets
had soared to £811,907. Further details

The outlay on fixed assets was so heavy
during the past 12 months that, though
shareholders put in £98,666 and surplus
profits helped with £37,000 or so. liabilities
were down only £28,000 on the year.

Gold’s Hosiery Mills started with a paid
capital of £280,000 (£BO,OOO of 8 p.c. cum.
prefs. and £150,000 of ordinaries), and amal-
gamated four cos., which took shares as fol-

£230,000
•No cash passed; but a lot of scrip was
issued for goodwill, more than 4s. in the £
being so represented. The share-register
may also have been inflated by the values at
which assets of the fusing cos. were pooled.
In its first year the co. paid £2969 war-time
profits tax for the Murrays under the amal-
gamating agreement, and that amount must
also be regarded as a goodwill payment.
The public is not directly interested in the
shares. The management was apparently so
confident of the future that when funds were
required for expansion it issued debentures.
A first mortgage on the undertaking was re-
served for the bank, and in 1921 the public
fully-subscribed £lOO,OOO in debentures of
£lOO each with a seven years’ currency, and
with rights to convert into ordinaries at
par on December 1, 1924 (these are the
“second debentures” hereunder). In 1922,
so rapid had been the expansion, the direc-
tors required further funds, but again the
share-lists were kept a close preserve, and
another lot of £lOO,OOO of 10 p.c. debentures,
this time with a five years’ currency, but
having no conversion privileges, were issued
and fully subscribed. (These are the “C”
debentures.)* Less than a year later the
directors discovered how crazy was this
method of financing, because, having met
with a reverse, and the bank refusing to
grant further accommodation, on September
1 this year the co. could not pay interest
on its second debentures, and it will also
default on November 1 when interest on the
“C” debentures falls due. Debenture-hold-
ers held a meeting on September 21 and ap-
pointed committees to confer with the direc-
tors “with the object of considering the
position, and of devising the best means ot
carrying on the business of the co.” The
debenture-holders meet again on November
21 to receive the committees’ report.
The only new shares issued since registra-
tion have been £4172 of ordinaries, evidently
all allotted to employees. But altogether
only £ll7l short of a quarter-million more
has been put into the business, and the direc-
tors borrowed every penny of it. It is as-
tounding that they should have committed
the co. to the redemption of £lOO 000 of de-
bentures on August 1.1927, and £lOO,OOO more
on December 1, 1928, considering that the
money was required mostly for extensions
of fixed plant. In face of their obligation
to the bank, which, no doubt, will press for
reduction of overdraft, the directors have a
tough problem ahead of them, even if manu-
facturing and trading conditions should re-
vive. The result of depending entirely on bor-
rowed money for development of the business
is that the directors now find themselves in
the wretched position of being at the mercy
of the bank on one side and of a formidable
body of debenture-holders on the other. Here
are details of the position so far as it is told
by figures:—

At June 80 last outside debts totted lip
£348,477, compared with £234,172 of fixed
funds. The first debentures for £117,834
were held by ..the A. B. C. Bank against over-
drawn accounts. Stocks, book debts and
liquid odds-and-ends had a book value of
£203,030, leaving an excess of debt over and
above all liquid assets of no less than
£145,447. Put another way, to represent
£145,447 of debt there is only property and
plant. Had everything run smoothly, there
would lmve been days of reckoning in 1927
and 1928, even if the bank did not meantime
become impatient. The troubles which have
suddenly piled on the co. because one credi-
tor would not. lend the co. enough to pay a
quarter’s interest-instalment to other credi-
tors should be a solemn warning to other
managements who have not experienced the
dangers of depending over-much on borrowed
funds.
The trading troubles of the co. appear to
have been due largely to the competition ot
foreign manufacturers who. by a combina-
tion of circumstances —cheaper supplies and
less costly labor, the effect of low exchanges
in some foreign countries —-and also, perhaps,
by design, have dumped their goods in local
markets at prices against which this co.
could not compete profitably on the pre-
sent Customs tariff. Another obvious trouble
with Gold’s Hosiery has been that owing to
its rapid expansion it had not got into a
steady stride when it experienced market
troubles. After writing off £19,225 for de-
preciation of machinery and plant, and pro-
viding £lOOO for lease-amortisation, the past
year’s loss was £50,348, and debiting the
cost of raising the last lot of debentures,
P. and L. was £53,417 to the bad. Manag-
ing-director Gold is surrendering 65.000
fully-paids to cover this deficiency and to
wipe out £12,000 represented by leaseholds,
the latter provision hinting that this asset
was not all it looked.
One way and another the proprietors ot
the old businesses which amalgamated find
their affairs in a pretty pickle. Apart alto-
gether from redemption of borrowings, they
are confronted with finding interest for tin-
bank, nearly £5OOO per quarter for debenture-
holders, and pref. divs. are £6400 in arrears
and will continue to accumulate. The bur-
den of debt is so great that it is practically
hopeless to seek the fixed capital the co. so
badly needs, and which should have been
raised at the time the funds were required.
Until the debenture-holders’ committees have
completed their investigations and a state-
ment is presented to show how the business
has fared since June, it is not practicable
for the outsider to ascertain the true posi-
tion of the second and “C” debenture-holders.
The co. may pull through successfully, but
as debenture-holders’ money is likely to be
tied to the business for much longer periods
than were contracted for, their best plan
would be to obtain independent reports by
experts on both the financial and manufac-
turing ends of the undertaking.

The management of this little proprietary Lite
office —-paid capital is £lO,OO0 —kept a cool
head during the past few years of frenzied
chase after insurers by the tribe of new con-
cerns. While some of the newcomers have
been falling over each other to write assur-
ances by tbe million regardless of the cost,
the Prudential has been content to plod
along and seek only business which its
long experience has taught it should be a
sound investment, both for the policy-holder
and for the co.’s shareholders. It has taken
27 years for income to reach the £50,000-
mark, and the way in which the manage-
ment has handled its small business provides
a striking otgect-lesson for the get-rich-quick
crowd. For many years on its capital—the
whole of which is intact and in sound secu-
rities —the Prudential paid an average of 10
p.c. p.a., and for the past three years an
average of 3;| p.c. more was added. That
was after actuary E. M. Moors had valued
policy-liabilities in the Ordinary and Indus-
trial branches —assuming 4 p.c. interest
earnings in the former and p.c. in
the latter —and found a surplus "of £0955.
Tbe directors allocated £6392 as bonuses for
Ordinary policies, that sum giving rever-
sionary additions of £10.381 and represent-
ing £1 p.c. p.a. on total assurances and
bonus additions of other years.
The Prudential began chiefly as a “bene-
fit” office: but very little of that business is
now handled. The actuary’s 1922 report
showed that at August 31 of that year there
were 6499 Ordinary policies in force assur-
ing £599.571 and 6182 Industrial contracts
for £159.565. The annual premium income
from the former was £30,679 and from the
latter £l5 502. Premium income from all
business for the 12 months ended August,
1922, was £41,388. The published accounts
do not separate operations in the two
branches, so no estimate of costs of either
Ordinary or Industrial activities can be
made by the outsider. Including the £lOOO
p.a. divs. and the triennial bonuses to share-
holders with expenses, the cost rate for a
number of years has behaved in this way:—
1910 ..£43 2 2 p.c. | 1919 ..£37 8 8 p.c.

1918 .. 39 1 3 „ ! 1923*. . 37 16 1,.
Expenses include £lOOO shareholders’ bonus.
Deducting; shareholders’ cuts, last, year’s ex-
pense rate was 33.85 p.c., a slight improve-
ment on the previous vear, and comparing
with 35.61 p.c. for 1920 and 41.88 p.c. for
1910.
At August 31 funds totalled £135,533, and
they and the £lO,OOO of capital were invested
as follows: public securities, £30,182 ; mort-
gages, £95,700; loans on policies, interest
accrued, deposits and cash, £13,840; out-
standing premiums, £375; office equipment,
£OOl. Investments are returning a satis-
factory rate of interest, the £0023 received
last year showing 4.8 p.c. on average funds
and capital.

For original investors Usher’s Metropolitan
has been a highly profitable investment. In
the reconstruction in 1920 their scrip hold-
ings were doubled, so 10 p.c. p.a. gives
them 20 p.c. But a big hotel which
underwent a revaluation of that magnitude,
and which now reserves less than Gd. for
every £1 it distributes, cannot be classed as
an attractive proposition even for the investor
who has a fancy for residential pubs. On
the strength of the 10 p.c. divs. the market
price of ordinaries is at around par, and at
these figures the buyer gives the originals Up
to 100 p.c. profit on their outlay. Construc-
tion of the Metropolitan was completed be-
fore city values and building costs took their
war-time leap, but the present co. three years
ago issued scrip to the old one for £lO,OOO
more than had been paid for the building site
and approximately £54;000 more than had
been spent on buildings and equipment.
Whether those valuations will be justified
by the future depends on something more
than the course of city property values. In
this instance much hangs on the use to
which the co. can put its premises, which
means that the shareholders’ divs. and
security for capital depend largely on the
efficiency of hotel-management. So far, A.
,T. Usher and his team have produced splen-
did results, notwithstanding the drought
and industrial uncertainty which affected
portion of the period since the reconstruc-
tion. How the management would fare in
less affluent times is a matter that the fancier
of Metrop. shares should take into consider-
ation. Unless the co. has been hiding some
of its profits—and there is no evidence of
it—the div. rate has been running perilously
close to earnings. At the end of three years
oydy £2256 has been visibly laid aside after
distributing £48,480 of divs. and providing
£l2OO for depreciation of plant and furni-
ture.
The co.’s financial position is fairly com-
fortable. Here are comparisons going back
to the time when the hotel was completed:—
1916. 1920. 1922. 1923.
Liabilities. . . . £69.944 £60.530 £42,191 £31,442
Liquid assets .. 4,869 22,323 21,726 12,256
Excess liabilities £65,075 £38,207 £20,465 £19,186
During the past 12 months the co. turned
its £lO,OOO holding of War Loan into cash, and
with it and the assistance of ±25,000 over-
drawn from the Commonwealth Bank, re-
deemed the £35,000 of debentures on which
it was working 12 months ago. In pre-
reconstruction years surplus profits reduced
the outside liabilities in great style, but
since then shareholders have been taking a
bigger bite. The excess of outside liabilities
over and above liquid assets has been reduced
from £38,207 to £19,186 in the three years
of the reconstructed co., but the true extent
of the improvement is contingent on depre-
ciation and furniture-replacement require-
quirements, which are as truly liabilities as
the bank overdraft and trade creditors.
Goodwill still stands in the accounts at
£17,132; the deficit in the table is the
amount of capital represented by that in-
tangible asset, less the £2256 balance of Profit
and Loss after paying divs.

The practice of granting speculative
options over big blocks of reserve shares de-
serves abusive language from bona fide share-
holders. Unless a large sum liable to for-
feiture is lodged with the co. granting the
option, these contracts should not be enter-
tained. The arrangement often enough re-
solves itself into nothing more binding than
a word-of-mouth undertaking. If the market
goes up the optioneer unloads mostly by the
process of forward selling, thereby creating
an atmosphere of scrip shortage and a vision
of bears baited. After this the co. announces
with a great flourish that the option has
been exercised, and that finances are roseate
in consequence. But if the market runs
sluggish, frequently the announcement goes
out that “Mr. So-and-So has not exercised
his option.” Then follows a serious market
relapse, and the weaker holders are financed
out, dragging others with them. The Hamp-
ton Plains boom of 1920 was built mostly on
options held over big blocks of White
Hopes by Lionel Robinson. Every time the
market galloped, the option was exercised:
but wlien the tide turned Robinson forgot
to exercise the 60s. one. The Crown, Bom-
bandy (N.S.W.), has had a similar experi-
ence. An alleged Melbourne group, but
really a big Pitt-street operator, took
options over 35,000 shares. The market
suited the first 15,000, which were picked
up at Bs. less the inevitable commission;
but the remainder at Bs. 6d. and 9s. are
still with the co. If the market had gone
to 15s. or 20s. the now forlorn 20,000 would
probably have been in circulation long ago.
A similar adventure in Vimy Ridge reserve
scrip has apparently miscarried.
The Broken Hill managements of the Cen-
tral and Junction are both reported to favor
the proposal that the Sulphide Corp. should
take over the Junction. The consent of the
two Boards is now being sought. The Junc-
tion people have ore but no mill, and while
the Central fire lasts there is little hope ot
much tonnage from the Sulphide Corp.’s own
mine.
To the technical staffs at Broken Hill the
outlook is far from cheerful. The long strike
commencing in May, 1919, crippled the cos.,
big and little. The small mines have hardly
had a kick in them since. The Central is
shut down, and is putting off staff. Block
10 is dead, the Proprietary and Block 14 only
threaten to wake up. The British is about
to be taken over by the North, and a big
crowd of officials are likely to be job-hunting.
If the Junction is taken over by the Sulphide
Corp. another bunch will be looking for work.
The Junction North is not too lively, and the
De Bavay will soon finish up. This leaves
only three live concerns, the North, South
and South Blocks mines. There is not a
decent show away from the main lode; sev-
eral mines are operating, but they are very
small and mostly doubtful.
A few dredges, tributors and small syndi-
cates still keep the flag flying in the Emma-
ville district (N.S.W.). Say, Smith and
syndicate have been exploiting the old Deep
Lead workings of the Vegetable Creek co.,
and with only five men at work cleaned up
2 tons 7cwt. tin oxide in nine days. Great
Britain tributors have had a good five-weeks’
run. Working in the vicinity of the town-
ship on the eastern side, on good ground
that had been handled in the pioneering days,
with two shifts going they have just cleaned
up 10 tons. Bob Johnston lias had a better
run on the old Elsie ground, near Tent Hill.
Though engine trouble caused a stoppage, his
latest run gave 2 tons 12cwt. Meanwhile
Thomas Bros., of Inverell, have installed an
up-to-date plant up the creek from Torrington
in ground formerly worked by Johnston.
Although Bob abandoned it the Thomas
brothers believe they can make it pay.
A prospectus announces the Mount Plea-
sant Mining and Smelting Co.. N.L.. River-
tree (N.S.W.). in 100,000 ss. shares, of
which 60,000, to be paid to 25.. are offered to
the public, and 25.000 paids and £l5OO cash go
to the- vendors. According to W. H- Wesley,
formerly of Mt. Lyell. and later of the Clark-
Wesley. Gundagai, the Rivertree lodes con-
tained' in 120 acres of leases were discovered
in 1887, when they were worked for their
silver contents. They carry arsenical, silver-
lead and gold ores, in addition to mixed sul-
ohides containing iron, lead, zinc and arsenic.
The plant required for the mixed sulphide
ore includes crushing, concentration, roast-
ing, sintering and smelting. The mill-
ing and smelting plant will cost £lO.OOO.
the site being on the main road to Stan-
thorpe, and water will be drawn from the
Clarence River and two creeks. Geologists
Pittman and Andrews are quoted in support
of prospects.
At the old Valentine, Tambaroora
(N.S.W.), recently acquired by the North
Lucknow Extended, the underlay shaft has
been put in good order to water-level at
160 ft. From the old No. 2 level there, a
crosscut will be put into the footwall in
search of known ore bodies. Concurrently
No. 3 level will be the medium of a similar
crosscut which should tap the gold-bearing
reefs 50ft. in. A 10-head battery has been
erected, and the dam is full, guaranteeing
three months’ water supply. There will be
a November call of a penny, but after that
the optimists expect the battery to pay for
prospecting.
Westralian Arbitration Court was pressed
by the Kalgoorlie mine-owners the other
day for several amendments in the existing
award, the principal of which were a reduc-
tion of 2s. per shift in wages and the abo-
lition of the annual fortnight’s holiday. The
old argument that under present conditions
tens of thousands of tons of low-grade ore
that wouldn’t pay to treat were being left
in the stopes, and that with one or two
exceptions the whole of the big mines on the
field were being worked at a loss, were
again advanced. Nothing was said about
the savings which might be effected in pre-
sent costs by modernising treatment plants
or by concentration of holdings and consoli-
dation of operations. What Kalgoorlie most
needs is entire re-organisation.

Westralia is divided into about 50 oil-
areas, and except on a few no work what-
ever has been done. On two, Freney’s and
Okes, drills are at work, and on only three
or four others has any genuine prospecting
been attempted. About a year ago Mines
Minister Scaddan thumped his fist on his
office table and told an awed deputation that
unless the areas were worked they would
have to be given up. Nevertheless, holders
continue to bluff Scaddan and his officials
with yarns about capital coming in shortly,
or of someone on nis way from America
to see them. The fact is that nearly all the
concessions south of Freney’s and Okes are
being shepherded in the hope that oil will be
struck by somebody else, enabling holders
to sell out during the boom that would
inevitably follow a strike.

Westralia’s latest “oil find” is in the bed
of a dry salt-lake a day’s march north-east
of Southern Cross. There a bore alleged to
show stains of petroleum has been put
down 30ft. Geologists sniff at the discovery,
So the Mines Department is putting down a
test hole. Meanwhile 'option-holders are
urging the public to come in.
North West Co., which drew one of the
many blanks at Hampton Plains and has
not been able to get on a winner in the
West since, recently issued a balance-sheet
showing £575 in hand.
Mt. .Tuglah (W.A.), which became the
temporary abode of the Mutooroo and other
migratory cos., is now almost deserted. Only
a few months ago glowing reports of “good
prospects” were being broadcasted by at
least half a dozen leaseholders. The little
work which followed soon dispelled the
illusion.
Mutooroo has turned down the Mighty
Atom, near Laverton (W.A.). So gone is
the 30ft. to 50ft. of 3oz. to soz. stone: it
shrank into a pipe 4ft. wide and 4ft. deep.
The co. still has £12.000 in hand after its
adventures at Hampton Plains, Transville
and Laverton. Where next?

Bendigo Amalgamated dropped £5506 dur-
ing the year ended June 30. thereby lifting
the debit at P. and L. to £23.067. It ran
the mines until September last year, and
then passed them on to seven subsidiaries.
Every one except Hercules has been a frost,
showing that Dyason was happier in selling
than in buying. At balancing date Amalga-
mated showed “assets” of £305,261, but they
included mines at cost, £7981: development.
£43.706: P. and L. debit, £23,067; and of
doubtful value were shares in other cos. (at
cost) £34,852. Plant and machinery had a
book value of £135,597, and repayments by
subsidiaries will be the source of future in-
come unless another Hercules opens up to
attach a value to the shares. Stocks on
hand £8268, Gas Co. debentures £11,632.
deposits £18,679, sundry debtors £11,171 and
freeholds and dwellings at £B5lB were the
tangible items. The co. owed only £1453.
Since the year closed the 303,807 shares paid
to 10s. have been written down to ss. each,

“Optic”: Early this year some Ararat
enthusiasts assailed me through the “Wild
Cat” because I declared that New Langi
Logan lacked staying power. At the time
it was announced that 6000 fathoms were
proved, with the wash “reticulated” east,
west, north and south. Nevertheless, no
profits have been squeezed out. Shares have
slipped back Bs. in price, and there never
was nor ever will be that amount of profits
in the 6000-fathom block. It is as-you-were
with a fresh pitch in use. Previously the
mine Complaint was water, or fuel, or war,
or shortage of men. Now the tanradiddle
is that the parties stope only half as much
ground as in days of old. But why not an-
nounce the fathoms mined as well as gold
won? In the days when Alec Peacock’s an-
cients were in charge, the area stoped was
recorded so that results could be checked.
New Langi’s work could be tested if full
scores were posted on the yields board.
What stands out is that £200,000 has gone
into New Langi Logan and not a div. come
out of it. The charm that lures the plunger
into taking fresh risks is the market gamble,
which is just about the last thing deep-lead
mining wants. No tributary to the south
has shown up. If it should appear on the
boundary of the South Langi that mine will
be the weary waster to benefit. Gold, unlike
the salmon, doesn’t swim up-stream. As a
decade of pumping must have got the wash
between Nos. I and 2 shafts as dry as a
kippered herring, now is the chance to shovel
out the 28dwt. ground affirmed to lie there.
Although the new Argentum field in the
Chillagoe. district is overshadowed by the
West Leichhardt silver-lead discoveries, the
main-lode, the Nightflower, is a very pro-
mising affair, and P. L. Goddard, g.-m. of
Chillagoe smelters, wears a broader smile
in anticipation of the supplies shortly to
come his way. The lode is well in evidence
for at least two miles, and as it attains a
width of sft. in places it is a sound geological
assumption that it is going to live to a good
depth. The State has secured three leases,
and has already started prospecting work.
Although no sensational silver assays have
come out, the ore is satisfactorily high in
that metal, samples ranging up to over
lOOoz. to the ton. A dozen leases have been
taken up. and another parallel lode lias been
unearthed. It is on the cards that further
discoveries will be made. Geologist St.
Smith likes the prospects of the field giving
a huge tonnage of highly payable ore. A
shaft on the original Nightflower lease is
down 30ft. with the lode averaging 3ft. of
galena and lead carbonates: 100 tons of tip-
top ore have already come out of this and
the other surface workings.
W. 11. Corbould. formerly g.m. of Mt.
Elliott, could scarcely be left out of anything
good on the Cloncurry field* and as he has
just inspected the new silver-lead field it is
a guinea to a gooseberry that his visit has
not been futile. He joins the general chonis
of experts as to its prospects, and considers
it the best thing of its kind ever found in
Queensland. The Mines Department has not
been slow in providing funds for well-sinking
and a topographical and leasehold survey.
Leases have been restricted to 10 acres as a
sop to “Red” ideas held locally, but this
will not prevent trafficking, and while it is
a gouger’s paradise at present, barring
the shortage of water, the next stage will
be development by cos. Practically all the
gougers now on the field are making from
£2 to £l5 a day. so it will take big money
to shift them. Many promising shows have
already been opened up. and further good dis-
coveries are expected.
After battling with adversity for a long
time, Clark’s, the last gold-mine worthy of
the name on Charters Towers (N.Q.),’has
thrown in the sponge and closed down. For
a small reef it has been a very good pro-
ducer: between the 400 ft. and 800 ft. levels
it turned out some very rich ore. In 1914
shares were being hawked about at 3d., and
shortly after that the mine made a good
rise on an ore-shoot crushing up to £22 per
ton. The mine is being kept clear of water
until the directors decide finally if anything
further can be done. The workings are down
somewhere about 1200 ft., but for the past
two years nothing special in the way of ore
has been sighted, and cash reserves are ex-
hausted.
Dr. Jensen is advising as to the operations
of the Australian Oil Corporation, at Beau-
desert (Q.), where after several years of
talk a borehole is about to go down. Other
geologists who have reported on various
Beaudesert areas have turned them down
with a thud. Jensen’s official reports give
a ray of hope as to the possibility of the
Walloon formation being oil-bearing in that
district. Leo J. Jones looks coldly on the
prospects of the same formation on the N. 8.
Wales side of the Macpherson Range.
The Jugular, the latest promising discovery
on the Kangaroo Hills field (N.Q.), has not
given as good an account of itself as surface
prospects indicated, and .Tack Lennox has
turned in the option secured by him a few
months back after spending £7OO on the
show. A shaft was sunk 115 ft. and several'
drives put in, but the formation went very
small. Only about two tons of concentrates
came out during the work done by the option-
holders.
No. 4 North Plicenix. G.vmpie (N.Q.), is
having a particularly dull run for share-
holders this year. The small September
crushing of 104 tons was worth only £4OO.
At present there is very little in sight in
the mine, but supporters are pinning their
faith on a further bonanza being struck, be-
cause the formation is carrying black slate
at several points. A mine like the Phoenix
needs a good cash reserve behind it to tide it
over the famine periods.
Fluor-spar is engaging the attention of a
Chillagoe (N.Q.) syndicate. The show is
about eight miles from the town, and has
sampled well. The syndicate is endeavoring
to learn what, it is worth in bulk.
Recently in Melbourne John Brandon
furnished a press view of gold brought from
the New Guinea mandated territory. Inci-
dentally, he may have meant to give a little
lift to the Kaili Options, which mining-
engineer Barton is now probing. The Argus
mining kill-joy, however, went to great pains
to explain that the leases under offer to that
syndicate do not cover the Kaili Greek,
which, if rich, is narrow and represents only
a party’s ground, even if that party was
willing to yield it up, which it isn’t. So
all the good Brandon did was to let the
market see where Kaili is and' where the
syndicate isn’t.

“Wilfrido” : The divorce case was unde-
fended, and the petitioner had just finished
telling how her suspicions, first stirred by
the continued prolongation of hubby s busi-
ness hours, were confirmed by an anonymous
letter from the usual Mr. (Mrs. or Miss)
Well wisher, who gave the name and resi-
dence of the home-wrecking vampire. The
respondent at first flatly denied knowing the

lady; then he pulled out the platonic-affec-
tion stop; finally he confessed infidelity, and
begged for forgiveness. ‘T never could really
forgive him, never!” exclaimed the witness,
whose counsel thereupon resumed his seat.
’S’Honah, however, was inquisitive, _ and
asked where the husband was. “He’s at
home,” was the unexpected reply. Up sprang
Mr. Costs. “I had no idea, your Honor”
and, addressing liis client: “Do you say that,
the respondent and yourself are actually liv-
ing together?” He was assured that they
were. The Bench then took a hand. “Surely,
witness, you know that if you have con-
doned the adultery you cannot obtain a
divorce?” “Now I come to think of it,”
said the petitioner brightly, “I did hear
something about that, but I told him straight
that I was going to get a decree tirsi, and, it
he behaved himself all right, I wouldn t
bother about the absolute !”
“Blue Bar'*: For the last 12 months a
bitter feud lias existed in our neighborhood.
My neighbors, the Macfuds and the Robin-
sons, have been at war, and our heretofore
peaceful street has been made the battle-
ground. The vendetta started over the de-
predations of the Macfud cat among the
Robinson dahlias, and developed m various
directions quite unconnected with the origi-
nal casus belli. But it chanced recently that
the cause of all the trouble, the Macfu
feline, passed away, and after drowning his
grief in copious libations, Macfud became so
saturated with the spirit of goodwill that he
sent a nice little card to Ins neighbor in-

“T A C ” • “Artilleur” hands a bouquet to
the Hun as a respecter of graves and ceme-
teries (B. 11/10/’2S). I would like to tell
him something I saw at a little village called
Doingt, not far from Peronne, evacuated by
the Germans in the big drive of March, 18.
In the little cemetery there Fritz had con-
structed dug-outs. All the tombs were broken
open, and the coffins stripped of their lead,
which was a very short commodity with Ger-
many at the time. Bo the bodies lay in the
rifled vaults as gruesome relics of the
Hun’s nice respect for anything that inter-
fered with military exigencies.
“Karee”: “Artilleur’s” par (B. 11/10/’23)
about the “decent streak” that showed itself
in lluu respect for enemy dead leaves me
cold ; I saw too much of the reverse side of
that character. When the kultured Alle-
mands hopped back in the French sector in
1918, after rifling and desecrating the civvy
vaults at Quennevieres churchyard and
shooting the old cure (the maire had been
executed as hostage in 1914), for pure van-
dalism, apparently, they blew up the little
monument erected by the 2me Zouaves over
the bodies of one of their sergeants and 11
men. killed there in 1915. The said sergeant,
by the way, who was my elder brother and
an A.I.F. ‘ reject, was badly wounded, and
the merciful Boclie put him out of his misery
by kicking his head in. Not only did some
German units blow up military graves, but
one also destroyed with incendiary bombs

“J. Shay”: I note that somebody has been
raising flip question whether Australia is
developing a new type. Years ago I aired
mv view in The Bulletin that the heads
"tul feet and hands of born-Australians were
all growing bigger.
The contention was
based on the obser-
vations of various
hatters and mer-
cers whom I con-
sulted and a lead-
i n g bootmaker.

that liis lengthy

convinced him that
Australian women
and girls were big-
ger than their
mothers, but that
the sons were, as a
rule, not so tall as
their fathers. A
nurse, who was pre-
sent, added her tes-
timony that, new-
born babes had in-
creased in size. As
I see it. Lilliputian

dingnagian men are
a lot scarcer than they were.
“Hambone” : While the subject of bayonets
is in The Bulletin routine orders, the Coun-
cil of Diggers might settle the question
whether Fritz used his fearsome-looking saw-
edged bayonet for man-maiming purposes.
These weapons were enthusiastically col-
lected by re-instousliments as souvenirs of
frightfulness, and the saw-edged bayonet
came to be regarded—on the home front, any-
how—as Fritz's only bayonet weapon and a
classic example of Ku'ltur. I believe the
first Allied troops who saw it in the war
were the Aussies in the Rabaul force. Actu-
ally only Fritz’s pioneer battalions were
equipped with the saw-edged, which was an

“Exul’’: Here’s a bunch of narrow shaves.
A Tasmanian doctor, whose car, containing
his wife, sister and two children, had broken
down, telephoned the other afternoon to a
garage for a tow. The procession had to
cross a railway line. When the first car was
partly across a train came unexpectedly
round a bend, and the doom of the second
car seemed sealed. The doctor jabbed Ins
brakes hard on and managed to pull up 10
inches from the rails. The tow-rope was not
long enough to let the front car get right
across, and the engine hit the back of it,
pitched the driver out without hurting him,
smashed the vehicle and parted the rope. A
couple of carriages of the train—a crowded
football special—were derailed by the shock,
but not a person in either of the cars or
the train was injured.
“T.R.H." offers an “inside” opinion:—
T wonder what qualifications R. G. N. Cliffweil
has for speaking (B. 18/10/’23) so highly of Con-
der’s efforts to “reform” Pentridge. Owing to my
former drinking habits I have on several occasions,
but-always at my own request, been remanded for
medical treatment in the Melbourne Gaol hospital,
where 1 had plenty of opportunity of talking with
well-known criminals who have “done time” under
Gender. -It is a fact that he made a “crucifixion”
speech every day when the “receptions” arrived.
“Now, men,” lie would say in words or in effect, “if
you submit and do what you are told we shall get
on all right, but if you don’t I’ll crucify you?”
He accompanied this with a swish of the horse-
soldier’s switch which he always carried. Conder
went to “Pen.” full of military ideas and military
snobbishness. He spoke of the gaol warders as
“my officahs.” When a prisoner was charged by a
warder with some trifling oifence against gaol dis-
cipline Conder frequently passed sentence without
allowing tile prisoner to make any explanation. The
improved food rations at the prison are due to the
continual strikes of the prisoners and the fires in
the mat-shops and wire-netting factory. Almost
every reform was suggested by the prisoners to the
Inspector-General and opposed by Conder, who re-
introduced solitary confinement and dark cells with
bread-and-water rations until he was stopped by the
1.-G. The instruments for ’the band were reluctantly
—-and compulsorily—paid for out of the prisoners’
gratuities, and Conder even wanted them to buy
a grand piano! His reputation even in the army
was nothing to that which he made for himself
in “Pen.” His conduct was directly responsible for
each of the fires which cost the Vic. Government
several thousands of pounds, and his retirement may
not have been unconnected with the fact that his
life had been threatened for the third time:
further, when a huge piece of iron-spouting fell
within a few inches of His head he realised that
business was meant. He was the most expensive
experiment the Vic. Government ever made in its
penal department, and the investment never paid a
halfpenny in the pound.

anything to show
better than the
Waterworths, who
used to pilot the

fall out along the
Illawarra before
the railway arrived
in those parts. In
wet weather pas-
sengers had to do
some hoofing, for
it took the horses
all their time to

from which place
lie also “tooled”

But for skilled driv-
ing the old Sydney
’busmen took the

few minutes to 8,
a score or more of
four- and five-liorse
'buses, loaded to
the limit, would
reach the bottle-
u e c k entrances
about the railway
station —and race
each other down to
the city. The older
generation will
have pleasant mem-
ories of a box seat
on the first ’bus to
reach the G.P.O. o’
mornings in the
days before electric
trams ran everywhere. By the way, it was a
Waterworth who drove the Governor through
the University cutting the day it was opened
for traffic, for which service he received a
gold-mounted whip.

“Nimshi”: Touching “sweepmail” (B.
11/10/’23), I suggest that in the great majo-
rity of cases the demands made on Tatt.’s
ticket-holders have “spoof” written all over
them. If the owner has backed his animal
lie is not in the least likely to scratch it,
whether the ticket-holder signs contracts or
rings up the police. If the owner hasn’t
backed the prad it’s the strongest evidence
that it’s a shocking bad prad, even in the
generally-partial view of its owner. Owners
are a sanguine tribe, and it is their money
mainly which keeps MacShortodds in afflu-
ence. On ante-post betting races, with which
sweeps are mainly concerned, most of the
heaviest betting is done prior to the race-day.
and the drawing most frequently takes place
after the bulk of owners’ money is on.

GERTIE: "Oh, that’s a sign you were dream-

Plenty of owners who have backed then-
horses will, of course, collar all the money
they can get from any source, but they won't
use the pen if the ticket-holder refuses to be
bluffed. Scotty Leighton, who drew £29,000
when Glen loth won the Cup, received a de-
mand for a 50-50 division of the spoils;
and the result of the race reached him at the
same time as the demand.

Isn’t Life like the house where he dwells for a time —
A kitchen for some with its chills and its glooms,
It? fires ashen dead, and its slush and its slime;
And for others the warmth of the big, gilded
rooms ?
Isn’t Wealth the fine prize that he struggles to win,
And shoulders and elbows his neighbors to gain,
Not caring a jot for the sorrow and sin
That the winning and gaining- may bring in its
train?
Isn’t Fame the bright vision, elusive and strange,
That beckons and smiles from the top of the stairs,
And still smiling always, and still out of range
Of his hands, the gay laurels of victory bears ?
Isn’t Love like a lyre with a magical tone
That captures his heart in the midst of the strife,
And keeps it a little aloof and alone,
From the hurry and worry and harshness of life?
Isn’t Youth like the beautiful light of the morn
That shines through a window that faces the east
On roses and lilies and flowers of the corn,
And a fine furnished table prepared for a feast?
Isn’t Age like the dusk that comes into a room
Where, palely, one lamp on the wall throws its
shine
On roses and lilies long robbed of their bloom,
And the crusts of a feast and the stains of spilt
wine ?
Isn’t Death like a man going out by the door,
And leaving hut little to show he has sped ?
For talked of a moment, and talked of no more,
Are the things that he did and the things that he
, said.

“10-2-4” on Conventions :
Monckton Hoffe, the dramatist, is an angry and
disillusioned man. Sued by a firm of solicitors for
costs incurred in a collusive divorce suit, he pleaded
that, “in accordance with the social code, which
insists on a husband giving his wife her- freedom when
she transfers her affections to another man, he iiad
agreed to Mrs. Hoffe’s plan for a divorce—to spend
a night at an hotel with another woman.” He
argued—and with a certain amount of reason—that
the man whom he would have made co-re. were
the modern social code not unfavorable to the co-re. -
fflaking habit, should be called on to pay her costs.
The Bench explained that it had no jurisdiction.
Then he accused the plaintiffs of having been privy
to the scheme by which the Court had been tricked
into granting his wife her divorce. Here he frac-
tured the social code in several directions--e n., by
giving his wife away in a public manner, arid by
squeaking on accomplices. Mr. Justice Swift stood
four-square on an irrefragable judicial convention —
that of never believing anything against a firm rf
high-class solicitors-—and gave judgment for the
olaintiffs. Many of the conventions of the social
code are as idiotic as that to which the unlucky

to hatch out the eggs?"
THE BOSS: “A very interesting piece of information , I'm sure.
Henry; but I fail to see what it has got to do with your
washing the dishes.”
THE WORM : “Well, you see, my dear, it makes a man feel bucked
up to 'think there's somebody getting a worse time than
he is!”
Hoffe took exception. There is the one requiring the
co-re.'to “do the right thing” and marry the lady.
Certainly it has fallen considerably into desuetude
of late; but just before the war a wealthy young
peer’ brought general reprobation on his head by
marrying another woman before the decree was made
absolute in the suit in which he had figured as co-re.
(IREAT EXPECTATIONS.
MILLIONAIRE MAGNATE (engaging secretary): “I want you to realise that this is a
position of great responsibility — l’ve got to have someone I can leave things to.”
And yet he was but one pf five. According to pre-,
war society’s muddy-minded interpretation of the
social code, the impartially affectionate w>ife had ’
some sort of prescriptive right to decide which of
the victims of her incautiousness should have the-
privilege of leading her to the registry-office. - • ‘
“T. 0.1.” : The last two houses of Lyons’s
Terrace, in Liverpool-street, Sydney, are
being demolished. They were built oyer 80
years ago by Samuel Lyons, an auctioneer,
who was also responsible for Lyons’s Auc-
tion Rooms, on the George-street corner now
occupied by the Union Building. In the early
days Lyons’s Terrace thought almost as much
of itself as Government House : there dwelt,
among others, Alfred Stephen, Chief Justice,
and Major-General Winyard. But the board-
ing-house lady got them later.
“Hamer” throws a philologist’s glance over
the Harbor City :
The Great Australian Bite is the name that has
settled on the section of George-street between
Park and Bathurst streets. It is the worst place
for cadgers in Sydney.
The Tree of Knowledge
was recently uprooted
to make way for the
city railway excava-
tions, and the shabby
assemblies that have
gathered there daily
from ancient times
now group around Cap-
tain Cook’s statue.
Poverty Point changes
its spots sometimes,
and has drifted from
the Theatre Royal cor-
ner to the Criterion
Theatre corner. There
used to be two Holes
in the Wa'I —a bar in
Wynyard-lane, with
wooden tables, chairs
and a sawdusted floor,
now abolished ; and
Slattery’s midnight pie
establishment, near the
Sunday Times Office.
Since the war, which
played havoc with
Slattery’s business, the
name has been collared
by a pie stall behind
a hoarding in Chal-
mers-street. The bend
from Circular Quay
into George-street used
to be Cape Horn, be-
cause of its perils.
Other cherished posses-
sions of Sydney are a
club known as the
Morgue, a Circular
Quay pub christened
the First and Last,
a pie stall (alongside
the Herald building)
called the Cafe r.e
Fairfax, a popular cen-
tral pub known as the #
Gluepot, and a street
dubbed Pneumonia-
lane.
“Astor” : All the public thanksgiving over
the recapture of the notorious Angus Murray
at St. Ivilda (VicA the other day doesn’t
obscure the fact that his seven weeks of
freedom, a good portion of which he spent
in the city, amounted to a contemptuous
challenge to the police. According to Mur-
ray’s own account, he dyed his hair brown
and walked about freely, once passing the
detective office in Russell-street; and while
discounting much of his tale as brag, there
is evidence that he was not suffering from
nervous prostration on account of his prox-
imity to the C.I.D. The fact that he was
roosting in a neat villa in the alleged com-
pany of the celebrated “Souizzy” Taylor,
who defied Potter and his bloodhounds for
12 months and then voluntarily surrendered
himself at the verv tick of the hour which
he had previously appointed, can’t be
accepted as a diploma to the sagacity of the
sleuths. It is not as if Taylor and Murray
are ordinary physical types without any dis-
tinguishing characteristics. Taylor is con-
spicuous for his bright, bird-like counten-
ance. flashy smartness of attire and jockey
physique, just as the long lean figure, singu-
larly depressed mouth and beady eyes of
Murray would invite a second look anywhere.

From a girl graduate in Munich :
A few mostly-Jewish profiteers are sucking fortunes
out of this country. The others have nothing. It is a
simple catastrophe every time prices are raised to
make them line up with the soaring mark. The vast
majority of the people live on black bread and
potatoes, with meat once a week. The children are
wasted. One sees all the demoralising effects of a
rotten currency. People crowd the banks daily.
Everywhere, in the streets and restaurants, they col-
lect and discuss prices. A day ago the English
pound was worth 15 million marks,; but there weren’t
enough paper marks to go round, and the banks gave
cheques. The shops, however, refuse to cash them be-
cause they can’t get marks for them. Yesterday the
banks closed down and were unable to change foreign
money, so I am living on the credit of my English
pounds. The shops charge enormous prices. They
can’t calculate the value of the mark to-morrow, so
they fix their prices far above the real value. In
the large shops prices are fixed in pounds, dollars
and Swiss francs. Riots and revolutions are expected
daily; and the pathetic misery 0 f the people increases
as France tightens her grip on the Ruhr. One hears
the most harrowing, and no doubt exaggerated, tales
from the Ruhr—of black troops swaggering about
the streets with whips; of children being shot down
for making faces at the French officers. One would,
like to disbelieve the reports, but one simply can’t
dismiss all the evidence. And there is a correspond-
ing passion of hate on the German side. I have
watched it growing in my six months here—growing
in bitterness with its increasing helplessness.

“L’Fou” : “Hamer” (B. 4/10/’23) instances
several large country-bred families which,
leaving the country, left also the habit of
having big families. Everyone who has
given the subject inquiry has found fecun-
dity going up or down as tlie population goes
citywards or countrywards. Levington Com-
fort considers the better type o : f American
is psychically unable to reproduce under the
artificial life-conditions of the modern big
cities. Quetelet supposed any city would die
out completely in a couple of generations if
cutoff from a supply of fresh country blood.
Pell, writing recently, observed that “we
are caught by that decreasing fertility which
attacks all civilisations.” (“Civilisation.”
mark, practically means urban life.) My
own observation supplies two notable in-
stances. Fofir sisters were reared in Mel-
bourne wheu that city was open-spaced. No.
1 married, settled in ever-growing suburbs
and had four children (two died in infancy).
No. 2 married, settled in suburbs, was child-
less. No. 3 married, pioneered in the Back-
blocks, reared 10. No. 4 lived in town,
an “old maid.” (The bush produces only a
negligible number of “old maids.”) My
other group, five brothers and sisters (out oil
a family of 12), came from Ireland in their
teens or thereabouts. No. 1 got a Govern-
ment job and stayed in Sydney. He had
one child. No. 2 went on the land: seven
children. No. 3 married a tramway employee:
three children. No. 4 married a farmer : nine
children. No. 5 married a suburban trades-
man : two children. (This group, being f.a.q.
Roman Catholics, may reasonably be
acquitted of birth-control. ) The figures con-
stitute one more indictment of centralisation
in a country like Australia in need of popu-
lation.
“The Rumpus” “Lei's” little yarn (B.
4/10/’23) of the out-back lady who had to
be pictured during an embarrassing period
because photographers did not happen often
in her district reminds me of my settler-
neighbors in Bananaland. The old man was
bent on seeing himself on paper, grouped with
his wife and nine children, and drove a tra-
velling photographer out from the nearest
township. But when the youngsters had been
dressed up they wouldn’t face the camera.
The whole tribe bolted into the bush and
swarmed up a gum-tree. The old man pelted
sticks at them, threatened and coaxed, all
to no purpose; they knew the gum-tree as
an old friend —the camera might be some
infernal-machine. Then dad displayed unex-
pected resource. lie fetched his missus and
the photographer, and the group was taken
with the old couple in the lowest fork and
the youngest, Nipper, away up among the
bees and blossoms.
“Harold Hardupp”: John Palmer got a
grant of 100 acres of Woolloomooloo in 1793
with free labor to develop it and build his
residence, Woolloomooloo House. He thought
so little of the value of the property that in
1522 he sold it for £2290 to Mrs. Riley.
When a commission was appointed in 1843
to decide upon the values of the land in order
to ensure an equitable division amongst the
Riley children, the estate was held to be
worth £97,274. William-street and water
frontages were assessed at £8 a foot; in
Forbes-street —intended for high-class resi-
dences—the figure was £4 10s.. in Riley-street
£4 and in Liverpool-street £3. Forty-seven
years later, in 1890, it was roughly estimated
that the value of the old grant was a cool
million; nowadays it is doubtless worth more
than a thousand times what Palmer sold it
for a century ago.
“X2X” : The new compound for overcoming
sterility in women is extracted from ordinary
wheat with ether, in which it is soluble.
It belongs to the chemical group of vita-
mines, and is said to be present in several
other substances, including egg-yolk; experi-
ments made on guinea-pigs have been
attended with undoubted success. But
as much has been claimed for previous
discoveries, the quest for such an agent
being a kind of philosopher’s-stone search
amongst modern physiologists. Some years
ago an elixir made from an animal ovarian
extract enjoyed a brief boom in London, and
was acclaimed as being the real thing at
last. Even leading gynaecologists prescribed
it, and the discoverer made a small fortune
before the inevitable doubts were thrown

on its efficacy. The present alleged fecund-
ity producer is the first of the vitamines to
be used for this purpose. It may remove
some of the causes of sterility: the chances
are, however, that the barren woman is only
tpo often barren because she was born that
way.

Fine ivory design from Old Japan
Carven round picture-frames or wreathed on jars
Of bronze or porcelain? A lovely thing
Crested with fragile green or paling to
A sallow foam of leafage exquisite;
And, broadening at the base, a student’s knife
That cuts the page of his first book of verse.
It stands now on bar-counters in a glass
To tempt the thirst to mugs of amber beer,
Or by tiie cruet in a restaurant
.in aerodrome for myriad summer flies- —
Where some pert scribbler with his grimy cuffs
Pours gibe and query from his fountain-pen
And scribbles venom, munching celery!
It comes to town through the wet, mists of morn—
Past the wild blotted gold of silky oaks
That try to write October on the fog—
In earth-streaked trusses on a farmer’s cart,
Jolting beside the emerald carrot-tops.
Too pale against their brick-red arrogance
It nestles closer to the cabbages.
Then on the trestle, by the dealer’s door,
It lurks amid the frail bright lettuces—
Cheap merchandise —a bunch of celery!
And yet to-day how it brings back to me
The twilights of a small well-curtained ro in,
A crystal vas'l of nodding- daffodils,
Brown rolls and butter on a willow plate,
A coffee,cup of glowing flambe ware;
And, in a slim and ringless hand, a stalk
Like ivory wand that conjures up a rose
Close to the fragrance of her parted lips!

“G.R.”: N.S.W.’s new Cocked Hat is one
of three members of the Rawson family who
were engaged in the unpleasantness with Arabi
Pasha at Tel-el-Kebir a generation ago. As an
incautious middy of 16 he was captured by
the Fuzzy Wuzzies and held prisoner for six
weeks. His uncle, the late Governor Harry
Rawson. was Principal Transport Officer,
and landed a C.B. for his share in the clean-
up. Another uncle, Wyatt, then a lieutenant,
led Wolseley and his troops across the desert
by starlight to Arabi’s entrenchments at Tel-
ol-Kebir. He was mortally wounded in the
first rush, and was promoted commander the
day before he died. Old Queen Vic. stood
sponsor for his posthumous daughter, who
was named Victoria, and is now the wife of
a naval captain, Frank Larken, C.M.G.
Another member of the clan married one of
the wealthy Mitchells.
The P. and O. mailboat Khyber carries a
distinguished ship’s surgeon—Major-General
Sir Robert Porter, who was Director of
Army Medical Ser-
vices during the
war and a Mons
man. His previ-
ous active service
included the Ashanti
and Boer cam-
paig n s. Retired
from the army.
Porter is still
vigorous at 65, and
the sea-going job is
one he likes. By-the-
way, another mail
steamer recently in
Sydney had in its
complement an ex-
colonel and an ex-
major. They were
both stewards.

ager of the Com-

The late T. G. Ellery learned his city-
management in S. Aus. He was only 18
when he went into Adelaide Town Hall, in
1890, under the genial autocrat Thomas Wor-
snop, then near the end of his long reign as
clerk. When Guy Boothby astonished his
friends by giving up the job of Mayor’s private
sec., to try his hand as novelist in London,
Ellery succeeded him. and in 1899 he was
made Town Clerk and held the billet for 16
years. Sydney nearly got him about 1901—
the General Purposes Committtee had recom-
mended him, but lie withdrew his nomina-
tion. In 1915 Melbourne embraced him.
It is just 100 years since Tasmania got its
first Supreme Court independent of the Ma
State’s judiciary. It took two Judges to
deal with the business’then, and only three
are needed now. The pace has quietened
down since the wild young days. At present
the Judges are not overworked, except, per-
haps, Nicholls, C.J., who is also Adminis-
trator, and longevity seems to bo with
them. In the 100 years there have
been only six Chief Justices (J. L. Pedder
was the first) and only nine other Judges.
Ewing, the third Judge at present, has been
a Commonwealth Senator, and does a side-line
in Royal Commissions.
T. S. Crawford, ex-parson and ex-M.L.A.,
has fallen into a job as Crown Prosecutor
in Sydney. He was previously prosecuting
at country sessions. Crawford was one of
three parsons whose association with Labor
politics about 1910 brought them into con-
flict with their church elders. F. B. Cow-
ling, now doing well in mining and com-
pany promotions, and “Jock” Garden are
the others.
The Last Post has been sounded for Maj.-
Gen. M. F. Downes. In his youthful mili-
tary days he served in the Crimea, and he
had two terms as
commandant in
South Aus. —from
1877 till 1893. In
1899. when he was
on the retired list
and in his 66th
year, George Tur-
ner induced him to
take the job of mili-
tary commandant
in Yic. His selec-
tion created a mild
sensation in inner
military circles
and in sassiety, as
it was thought that
the strings ha d
been successfully
pulled for Col.
Bingham, a con-
nection by mar-
riage of John Mad-
den. Governor
Brassey was mor-
tally offended.
When Turner
sought a dissolu-
tion, on being de-
feated by McLean,
in Nov.. 1899, Dun-
can Gillies told
members not to
worry Brassey
would refuse. And
so he did.
GOUDIE, Vic.’s
new Minister of
Public Works.
Cyril Murphy, the second of two brothers
to become a Westralian Rhodes scholar, has
been given a free passage ou a Common-
wealth ship to take him to England—he can-
not get any benefit from the scholarship until
lie is in residence at Oxford. Young Murphy,
whose father is dead, went to work as a
miner to keep the home going and provide
his brother with the means to get away when
hs was awarded the Rhodes scholarship in
1921. He worked this year again to earn
his own expenses, but people who have heartt
of his great fight have not only subscribed
funds, but got the State and Federal Govern-
ments to help.
Another S. Australian veteran of German
descent has gone—M. W. Holtze, the botani-
cal expert. After studying botany as a
youth at St. Petersburg and elsewhere, lie
came to Australia in 1872, put in 18 years as
curator of the Botanic Gardens at Darwin,
and then succeeded Schomburgk at the Adel-
aide Gardens. Six years ago lie retired to
private life on Kangaroo Island. The “type”
orchard at Mylor remains a monument to liis
work. It contains, for reference by intend-
ing growers, 1100 varieties of pears and 1500
of apples.
“Rounds” : After drawing £6OO a year pen-
sion for 30 years, Ebenezer Thomas, who was
sec. to the Yic. Premier’s Department in the
time of Service, Gillies, Munro. Shiels and
Patterson, has handed in his checks. He was
allowed to retire when he was between 50
and 60, partly because his health was sup-
posed to be impaired and partly because it
was intended to reduce the status of his job.
He has long been forgiven for having been
the most unpopular officer the service ever
produced. The day J. B. Patterson an-
nounced his retirement a group of scribes
threw up their hats. Thomas was on the
State’s pay-roll as boy, youth, departmental
head and pensioner for 70 years, and must
have received about £30,000 in that time.
He left under £2OOO.
“Cobba-Cobba” : Well-nigh 30 years ago
“Capetown Bob,” then wincliman on the old
Corea, drove the first tram used in discharg-
ing coal at Townsville (Q.). The hatch-
man of that day is still earning a crust as
hatchman, but his former “winchy,” by hard
study, grit And brains, has steadily mounted
the rungs in the ladder, and is now Capt. R.
Cliarlin, of the A.U.S.N. Wyreema, Austra-
lia’s biggest coaster.
Gone to his last change of all, George
Scott, of Brisbane, who, after graduating at
London ’Varsity, went missioning in the
South Seas, later became headmaster of
Toowoomba, Brisbane and Maryborough
State schools, then (1876) took to banking,
and eventually resigned the managership of
the Bank of N.S.W. at Townsville to
become the first Queensland manager of the
Union Trustee Co. His variegated life
rounded off at 85.
Andrew Rankin, just dead, put up what
is surely a record by becoming a bank man-
ager at 21. That was in 1864, when he was
given charge of the Gundagai branch of the
Bank of N.S.W. He was a son of late
squatter Arthur Rankin, of Glen Logan,
Cowra (N.S.W.). %
Dean Kiely, of Qoraki (N.S.W.), who
died the other day on his way home from
Lewisham (Sydney) Hospital, was born in
Cork 58 years ago, and was the first student
to volunteer for the new diocese of Lismore.
Practically the whole of his Australian life
was spent in that part of the Ma State. He
has a brother, also a dean, in Perth.
J. H. Owen, who is to be sec. to Vic. Out-
ports Commission, was private sec. to Bent
and went with him to England in 1907.
Later he secretaried the long-drawn-out
Housing Commission. Publicity-officer to
Mclver, Director of Land Settlement, has
been his most recent job. Originally he came
on to assist the Duke of York Reception
Committee in 1901, and has been handed a
succession of Government jobs ever since.
“Rocking-Screw”: Jack Bailey's success
at the recent A.W.U. inquiry is not his first
adventure of the sort. When lie and Bill
Lambert were first elected to office in Cen-
tral A.W.U., displacing Ike Smith and his
friends, charges impugning his unionist bona,
fides were laid. An exhaustive inquiry re-
habilitated him. Bailey’s chief misfortune
is that he is no judge of men, and frequently
picks on “crooks’’ or non-stayers as lieu-
tenants and associates. His recent experi-
ences should have taught him wisdom in
that matter. However, his opponents may
be sure of one thing: that he’ll fight to a
finish, a quality bushmen like above all
others.
“Pahiatua” on some friends of Bony’s:—
I question “F.A.’s” statement (B. 27/9/’23) that
the Misses Balcombe, formerly of Sydney, “one of
whom married the late Dr. Taylor, of Woollahra,”
are identical with the girls, Elizabeth and Jane
Balcombe, who brightened a few years of Napoleon’s
existence on St. Helena. Balcombe was a Govern-
ment official at St. Helena, and the owner of the
Briars, a bungalow cottage, llis. family consisted
of his wife, the two girls mentioned, and a brace
of small boys. Napoleon resided! at the Briars for
some nine or ten weeks, while Longwood was being
prepared for his reception. The girls, were in their
early ’teens, Elizabeth, the younger, being .about 15
when the Northumberland dropped anchor in James
Bay, in October, 1815. Elizabeth, or Betsy, spoke
French fluently, and \vas of considerable assistance
to the fallen Emperor in translating all the English
books and papers which came his way. She was
the young hoyden who held Napoleon up at the
point of his own sword. The friendly relations
existing between the Balcombes and Bonaparte did
not escape the worried eye of Sir Hudson Lowe, and
ip 1818, three years before the Emperor’s death,
notice to quit the isle, politely given in a “six
months’ leave of absence,” was served on Balcombe,
and he ,and his family returned to England. Eliza-
beth Balcombe (Mrs. Abell) published her “Recol-
lections of Napoleon at St. Helena’’ in 1844. It
looks as if “F.A.” has confused the lady with
descendants of the family.
E. A. Barton, son of Toby, was Crown
Prosecutor at Darlinghurst the other day.
Sydney Conservatorium of Music gets from
Adelaide (where the Con. is run by the ’Var-
sity under a bequest from Thomas Elder 30
years old) Gerald Walenn, who was brought
from England with a big reputation as
teacher of the violin when Eugene' Alderman
died in. 1917, and has greatly popularised the
art of fiddling in Adelaide. Walenn, the
Gilbert and Sullivan humorist, is a brother.
Doctor-of-Laws A. D. Ellis, who, as a
barrister, represents the Vic. Government in
the sifting of the Daylesford election and
Breakwater scandals, is the son of a State
schoolteacher, and was himself one till the
war. He got his captaincy in the A.1.F., and
when the scrap was over wrote a history of
his division, with a foreword by Focli. Then
he took to law, and his war-book, which he
put in as his thesis, riveted his doctor’s
degree. In his teaching days Ellis ran like
a greyhound, and won championships over
hurdles in two States.
In St. James’s Church, Sydney, is a hand-
some memorial window to Robert Campbell,
M.L.C., of Macleay-street. Three brass tab-
lets explain that he was son of Robert Camp-
bell, one-time of Lower Fort-street and
Colonial Treasurer in 1859, and grandson of .
that other Robert Campbell who came down
from India in the 1790’s and established him-
self on Sydney Cove, on the spot known for
years as Campbell's Wharf. This latter
Campbell was the youngest son of the last
laird of Aslifield, and a cadet of the house of
Duntroon. He got a grant in what is now
the Federal Capital area, which explains the
origin of the title of the Military College now
established there.
One of the men implicated in a series of
recent Sydney criminal cases was eight years
back handed sentences totalling over 100
years. They were practically all concurrent,
however, and good conduct reductions opened
the prison gates in
a few years. The
char ge s against
him since then
have included bank
robbery, house-

“Kenbir”: Jack Bresbees, a Canadian
scribbler who is tramping through Australia
in search of copy, walked the 65 miles from
Coolibali to Bourke (N.S.W.) the other day
in 18hr. 48min., having only two 15-minute
spells en route. The book he carries bears
the times of arrival and departure in the
villages passed through, and each entry is
certified as correct, mostly by the local post-
master.
It will not be surprising if John Bowser,
Wangaratta’s idol in the Vic. Assembly, is
some sort of a knight before the end of
next year, lie is one of the most cultured
men in the House, and, like many idealists,
somewhat absent-minded. He used to forget
about the State motor-car waiting outside
when he made calls in the days of his Pre-
miership, and would walk back or take a
tram. Then he would feel disturbed because
he had caused inconvenience to the chauffeur.
“0.P.H.” ; Postmaster-General Gibson told
a deputation the other day that an absent-
minded banker, who was sent by his wife
to post letters, put five £1 notes in the postal
pillar instead, and returned with the letters
in his hand. He informed the department,
which sent a special officer to recover the
notes. Speaker Watt, who was with the
deputation, said it would have served the
banker right if he had lost the notes, “for
being in such a condition so early in the
night”—it would have been pardonable, pre-
sumably, at midnight. Anyway, it was just
on the witching hour that a Federal policy
speech, intended for Sydney, was once
absent-mindedly posted to Brisbane.
Some salaries of Vic service top-notchers:
Cattauach (Chairman of the Water Com-
mission), £2000; Norris (Auditor-Gen.),
Pitt (Under-Treasurer), McPherson (Pub.
Ser. Commissioner), Collins (Parliamentary
draftsman), Broome (manager State coal-
mine), Maclndoe (Crown Prosecutor), Tate
(Director of Education), £1250 each;
Guinness (Crown Solicitor), Phillips (Chief
Clerk of Supreme Court and Master-in-
Equity), £l2OO each; Dickson (Under Sec-
retary of Chief Sec.’s Department). Merrin
(Secretary of Mines) and Meek (Secretary
to Treasury, a sub-head), £lOOO each.
Mclver, Director of Land Settlement, a sort
of super-head, draws £1750.
“Mendelian”: President "Jim” McMahon,
of the N.S.W. Employers’ Federation, tear-
ing into the direct-actionists, contradicts the
theory that the young cocks learn to crow
from their elders. Jim was reared and edu-
cated in a school of direct action. llis
father, the famous “Butty,” was a carrying
contractor with several yards of drays and
lorries. He flourished long before unionism
reached trolly and draymen, and men and
horses worked till the work was done. A
string of lorries wending home at midnight
in those days of no overtime was a common
sight. They were a rough, tough, strong lot,
those henchmen of Butty’s, and Butty
was their boss. He never argued the point
with a recalcitrant, drunk or sober. It was
the hard word, the harder blow and the
hardest throw, and the victim found himself
outside the gate. Arbitration killed the old
chap—he preferred Direct Action. Jim
undoubtedly inherited his football talents
from his father.
VALUES.
[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
I came across twelve thousand miles of sea,
Twelve thousand million waves,
To find the souls of many things that be—•
Old things my spirit craves.
And there was London old and grey as Time,
Mother of half our race.
I saw her sleeping, wrinkled, grave, sublime,
No smile upon her face.
I thought of all the years that she had known,
Her work, her pain, her pride;
And there rose up a city of my own,
Unthought of, by my side.
Twin cities rose, on either side of me—-
Beauties I had not loved!
Young queens and wrathful from across the sea....
I hid my head, reproved.
I saw Westminster full of honored dead
Dreaming beside the Thames.
“Tell me your pioneers, your past!’’ she said
I did not know their names!
I found the lakes which Wordsworth once had sung,
Paths that his feet had roved ;
The smiling fields, the rugged hills, his tongue
Has made so much beloved.
1 came for inspiration, and I found,
In my heart welling strong,
An aching joy in old familiar ground,
A haunting homeland song.
And I remembered suddenly a thing
To make me blush for shame—
My trees that I have never thought to sing,
My loves unknown to fame!
London.

ABORIGINAUTIES
MADE IN AUSTRALIA
BARNES LINSEED OIL
“Riverina”: “The Overlander’s” swallow
that built its nest 12ft. down a well (B. 0/9 / 26)
reminds me of a pair of wagtails who were not so
cautious. Their home was erected on the large
overhead wheel of a hand-drilling machine. This
wheel, of course, spins horizontally, and the nest
was woven to a spoke. The machine was lying
idle during building operations and the laying of
the precious eggs, but in the sitting period the black-
smith—a big-voiced, black-bearded, rough old bush-
man discovered with obvious distress that he would
have to use it. And use it he did, the grand old
chap turning the handle at a snail’s pace while
Mrs. Willie sat unconcernedly on her merry-go-
round. The ’smith cursed the lady affectionately
each time he had to work the drill, but when the
young ones were hatched out there was nothing
ADVANCED PIIYSIOLOCY.
“Can anyone tell me what eyelashes are for?"
“To protect your eyes?'
“Now, what is your skin for?”
“Please, miss, to hold your meat in.”
affectionate in the curses he roared at inquisitive
people who came too close and disturbed the family.
“Gundagai”: “Paroo Peter’s” rooster (B.
4/10/’23) which laid an egg had a brother—or
sister- —at the Beauclesert (Q.) show last year. But
this one not only had the rooster appearance and
crowed and laid eggs, but also waved an extra leg
from astern. Neither of these, however, have any-
thing to crow about over a St. Kilda (Vic.) hen
which recently laid a hatched egg. The chick was
fully formed but not quite ready to step out and cell
the world what a wonderful mother it had.
“Helen”: “Valamac” (B. 20/9/’23) re-
minds me. In the early days of her married life
on the Darling (N.S.W.) a woman w'as camped out
15 miles from home, with her husband and young
baby, when he asked her to go for a canter on one
of the buggy horses. The “monkey” on the saddle
was a, piece of galvanised wire, and when the brute
bolted she clung to this with such effect that after
she had come off —with more haste than dignity—she
noticed that her third linger was severed at the first
joint, and the top was hanging by a piece of skin. The
ends of both bones were showing white and clean. Her
husband wanted to cut off the hanging piece there
and then, but she pushed it into place and bound
it up with a handkerchief. Next day they, started a
120-mile trip per buggy through bog and floods to
interview an inebriated doctor, who charged a guinea
to tell her that the finger had knit beautifully. It
is now as flexible as the others, and, except for a
slight scar, doesn’t look as though anything unto-
ward had happened to it, 1 know this is true
because —it's my finger.
‘"R.R.L.”: Our tvvius had to write an
essay on birds. This is the effort of one: “Birds
are such soft, dear, sweet, little things. Some sing
and some don’t. We put some birds in cages, which
is very crewl, as they have not room in which to
fly. I saw two magpies this morning on our roof.
1 think one was a thrust. We eat some birds,
chooks, ] mean. Australia’s natural anthem is a
big bird called the kookabugga.” The other, after
much chewing of the end of the pen, got this off:
"Birds are pretty and also useful. They get feather-
beds from birds, also eggs and duck-eggs, but then
they are too strong. 1 once saw a dear mother
swan with a flock of dear little, fluffy singlets run-
ning after her.”
“Borom”: Instances of white men going
eomplettly “native” in New Guinea arc fairly numer-
ous, hut cases of them turning cannibals as well
are rare, though there have been a few, both in
Xew. Guinea and the Solomons. About. 20 years
ago there was one in the Rabaul district. The man
had been living, in. a native village for several years
before rumors to the effect that he participated in
human flesh banquets began to creep abroad. These
were investigated by the Germans, then in posses-
sion of the territory, and found to be based on fact,
whereupon the man was promptly invited to leave
by the next boat, his fare being paid by the Adminis-
tration. He went to Sydney and from there made
his way to the British Solomons ; but what happened
to him afterwards was never reported. Quite recently
another case occurred in Dutch New Guinea, not
far from Fak Fak, but the authorities there were
less lenient than the Germans, and they presented
the human ghoul with a term in gaol.

“Nymboida”: Rc “D.F.’s” par (B.
27/9/”23) on telegonv. When a boy 1 owned a
shapely pony mate that had a foal to a nondescript
Arab sire, low in the loins, and with .a high croup.
The foal had none of the characteristics of the sire
except the bay color. Next year the mare bad
another foal sired by
a well-made blood
horse (she hadn’t been
within 40 miles of the
Arab in the mean-
time), but the progeny
had the exact carriage,
conformation and de-
formities of the former
sire, with the color of
the dam. Again, a
small, well-bred, clean-
legged pony mare on
a North Coast (N.S.W.)
farm had her first foal
to a draught-horse. The
next half-dozen were
all sired by a well-
bred galloway, but the
first two showed marked
draught characteristics
—hairy fetlocks, big
bone and muscle, and
great girth. One in
particular was a verit-
able cob, fit to carry
a 16st. man, although
only about 14 hands in
height. The remain-
ing four gradually as-
sumed more pony-like
proportions, and the
last w>as clean legged.
Notwithstanding Dr.
G'ossar Ewart’s science,
seeing is believing,
and I’m still a con-
firmed telegonist. So
deep-rooted is the be-
lief in telegony that
most breeders of high-
class animals discard
any dam that has been
bred to a sire of doubt-
ful lineage.
"Grisatre”: Tell “M.J.” (B. 27/9/’23)
that niggers are not the only Aussies who are “good
on the hoof.” Last year there arrived here (North
Coast, Q.) a bewliiskered old bagman who had wheeled
a barrow from Longreach, a distance of about 000
miles. It was a rickety old contraption at that.
He landed a job from my dad,—and after getting a
“bit, on the hip” trundled Matilda out on the
road again.
■* * * *
"Boundary Rider 32”: Re “Bill R.” (B.
13/9/’23) on the durability of red-gum and yellow
box in the soil. I can take him to a gidvr fence
on Mogilah station, near Goodooga (Western N.S.W.),
erected 54 years age-, in which the poHs are as
sound as when they were.put in. Buddha (some-
times called sandalwood, but not to be confused
with the commercial timber of that name) is even
more lasting', and, having had “nearly half a century
of yakker among all kinds of timbers,” Bill will
doubtless understand the remark that fencing con-
tractors and station-owners will accept Buddha posts
a half-inch less in diameter than gidVa
“Zanthus”: Vandals have lately destroyed
what was probably the biggest tree still standing in
Australia, if not in the world. It was near Wangra-
belle, in the far east of Gippsland (Vic.), not far
from the N.S.W. border. This gumtree was 140 ft.
THE PRIDE OF THE NATIVE-BORN,
“You know that pfeller, boss? him poor purry fweigner!”
to the first branch and just on 300 ft. in height
(the figures were worked out by a surveyor). But
it was ringbarked along with tile rest.
“11.R.R.” : A soldier-settler near Nauango
(C).) acquired some decent dairy heifers which re-
cently commenced to fulfil the Divine Command in
the middle of a very dry spell. The owner, whose -
front name is Thomas, while doing- some, burning off,
found one of his cherished herd in. the final stages
of an interesting- condition and an indifferent posi-
tion for tlie purpose. Tom took liis first course in
midwifery, and on the arrival of the little stranger
knocked him on the head and cremated him in one
of his fires. Returning- to- the recumbent Strawberry
he hovered round until she got up. Once on her
feet she turned round and, seeing- Tom, made for
him. As she moved very.weakly he stood his ground
and tried to fend her off, but unavailingly. She
licked him all oxer and adopted him on the spot.
At first Thomas treated it as a joke; but having the
lady bellowing outside his hut all night, arid being
subjected to her embarrassing attentions in the milk-
ing raid, he wants to know how to make a cow
wean her calf at the tout. Seeing that the puzzled
Strawberry objects to her “calf” extracting her milk
with his fore feet and that Tom will make no conces-
sions there-anent, the position is a difficult one;
and as he wants to keep the heifer what is he to do
about it?
“Hamer”: Sydney Hospital has an in-
mate severely injured by a stingray whose body
xvas no bigger than his hand. He handled it by
accident while hauling in his nets at Cowan Creek,
and the barb stuck in the top of his finger. The
poison made him delirious, and he was rushed io
hospital; but although first the top of his finger
and then the whole finger xvas cut off, his hand may
have to go, too. The poison has rotted the bone.
"Comeback’ : Talking- of heavy wethers, T.
Bray, of Yychan station, exhibited at the Kugowra
(N.8.W.) show of 1914 three Lincoln-cross wethers
averaging 2351 b., and in 1915, three Lincoln crosses
averaging 2541 b. The heaviest was 2691 b. At each
succeeding show wethers of equal quality have been
exhibited till this year, when, owing to drought,
artificial feeding was necessary for several months
and, even so, three comeback xvethers averaged
2221 b. and three Lincoln-cross wethers averaged
2471 b., while a comeback lamb showing milk-teeth
weighed 1301 b.
"Jacky Roo”: “The Toiler’s” yarn about
the prad that got stuck in an iron tank (B
4/10/’23) reminds me. In the Barnett district
(Q.) some years ago an -abo. climbed into a square
tank half-full of corn to get a feed for the horses.
The fumes were so deadly that Binghi was a corpse
before he could escape. In the summer there’s no
easier way to commit suicide, il know, because I
was out to it for five minutes in the same way.
“F.A.’s” convict explorer:—
Apropos discoveries of Australian fauna. The
man who probably saw more of our birds and ani-
mals from No. 1 position was James Wilson, known
to Inns'to as “Bumboue,” who from 1788 till 1800
wandered about from Goulburn in the south to the
Hunter in the north and the Blue Mountains in
the west. In 1797 he reported himself to Governor
Hunter, after a proclamation had been issued with
the idea of finding out how many convicts were
within the'settlement, and he told his Ex. that In
had been exploring the country within a 100-nnies
radius of Sydney. He said he had seen seven dif-
lerent animals which were strangers to Sydney, and
mentioned one,in particular, “like a dog but much
larger.” He also described a bird, which was after-
wards recognised as the bird-of-paradise, hitherto
unknown in the colony. Wilson was subsequently
given a musket to shoot game, specimens of which
he gave to the Governor from time to time. Many
of the statements of this wild, free-lance explorer
were verified by the authorities, and his south-western
journey in company with Barracks, a trusted free
servant of Hunter, stands out as an epic in
primitive exploration. Unfortunately most of his
descriptions of birds and beasts are just too vague
to be of use for identification purposes. The bird-
of-paradise is the only item I have seen placed i to
his credit officially, though as far as N.S.W. is
concerned he takes the dingo’s scalp. Wilson was,
apparently,,the first man to shoot the lyre-bird, bird-
of-paradise, wombat, rock-wallaby and black duck;
THE LAUREL WREATH.
MRS. MURPHY: " Weren’t you surprised when
she summonsed per for assault? Why.
she give you nearly as had as she took.”
MRS. O’GBAFY : "No ; it was proud I was
of the summons—it proved who had the
best of the argument.”

tion-he was the first white man in Australia to

HEAVEN.
[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
There are people who hope that the heavens will
hold
Gleaming angels with trumpets, and pavements if
gold ;
There are some who imagine a river of blue
Which they stroll bj', in splendor, with nothing to
do!
There are those who are sure they will meet with and
know
All the people they loved when they lived here below ;
So in endless re-union their lives shall be blest,
As they pick up the gossip of angels with zest.
But for me 1 will ask of the Lord of the Blue
Just some scrub-land and gum-trees, and horses for
two,
With an east wind that’s smoky to blow in my face,
And permission to gallop all over the place.
They may keep all their harps and their palaces fair
If they leave me some grass land and gum-scented
air ;
1 will ask nothing more of the Lord of the Blue
Than an east wind that’s smoky, and horses for two

“O. McKay M.”: “Country Ped” (B.
27/9/’23) impliedly questions the authenticity of my
reference to Dampier’s “Voyages and Adventures.
That work was a posthumous publication (produced
in 1776, not 1770), and its musty volumes may be
found complete in the Melbourne Public Library.
Upon the kangaroo issue, “C.P.” is confusing Dam-
pier’s two voyages to Australia. It was upon his
first landing (with the Cygnet buccaneers in 1688)
that he says he saw “no sort of animal.” Ten years
later, however, the quondam rover was commissioned
by the Admiralty, and, as Flinders notes (“Voyage
to Terra Australia -Vol. 1., p. 62), visited a second
BROTHERS IN MODERATION.
“Yus, mister, rum's a curse, all right. That’s
why I drink beer.”
“Goodness me, my man, beer is also a curse!”
“That’s right, mister. But beer is only a
mild sort of a curse—like 'Goodness
me!’ ”
time the western coast of Terra Australis, being then
sent out purposely for discovery in his Majesty’s
ship Roebuck. It was during his second stay that
he came across “a sort of raccoon” which, Flinders
writes, “appears to have been the small kanguroo,
and if so this description is probably the first ever
made of that singular animal.” C. R. Long, whom
“Country Ped” quotes, has taken his material from
Flinders’s account. Dampier’s journal, as I pointed
out before, categorically refutes any statement that
the old mariner first spotted the ’roo when he made
the western coast in 1088.
* * * *
“F.A.” : I coiue on the board with a few
remarks about .Tack Howe’s much-advertised tally,
quoted by “Ringer” (B. 27/9/’23). It is generally
accepted among old-time shearers that Howe’s ex-
ploit was a put-up job. The big gun cleaned up
the number of jumbucks put to his credit all right,
but the sheep were not the general run, even for
the light-fleeced Queenslanders of the time. An old
station-hand who was present told me that they
were all bare-bellies, w'ith necks like those of vultures.
“Ringer” is right when he says How'e’s tally will
stand. The Bananaland jumbucks have improved a
whole heap since those days, and the introduction of
a bit of Vermont blood into the northern flocks has
PROOF—DA MNING PROOF.
MINISTER: “What makes you say Tom Trevor is going to the
Devil?”
CHAPEL STEWARD: “Well, last time I do visit ’e, I see a grocer’s
armanack with a hussie’s face on it 'unged up where the
text ’c got at Sunday-school used to i.e.”
slowed up the smooth cut over the shoulder, which
was one of the places where the old hand got a
break on the newchum in the race to dodge the
cobbler. Although the heavily-yolked wrinkled-
necked sheep is not still in favor, he has left a
mark on the Bananaland flocks that will keep the
majority of tallies well below the double century
for a few years yet.
“The Rumpus” : For expert sheep-tallying
I nominate a W.A. man whose name if I remember
aright was Shroudie. Once, on a small bet, he
successfully counted 1200-odd woollies as they were
rushed through a 12ft. gateway. Those sheep were
rushed, too, because the man with whom he betted
was behind them with the dogs and two Binghis.
The same swift counter, however, would make a
mistake tallying 20 baas if he had to touch each
one.
“Golub” : The crow described by “Orney”
as having died from the bite of a tiger-snake in
three minutes (B. 27/9/’23)'is the first bird that
1 have heard of being killed in this way. Usually
the fangs of a snake are unable to penetrate the
feathers, and in most cases the poison is spilled
on to them, instead of being injected into the flesh.
Because of this there has arisen in some quarters
a belief that the kookaburra is immune to snake
venom, people having seen it bitten during a tussle
without suffering any ill-effects. The jackass is
not protected physiologically any more than the
dog or the cat, and if he were to receive a snake-
bite on some portion of his anatomy uncovered by
feathers he would probably go out to it just as
quickly. The belief is an excellent instance of the
faulty observation of some people who are con-
stantly in touch with nature.
“Billy Nudgel”: I appreciated “Gonda-
mine’s” (B. 27/9/’23) dissertation re rabbits and
their system of birth control during bad times, but
I can’t believe that the works of Malthus, Margaret
Sanger or Marie Stopes will be found on their
library shelves, neither do I accept the theory that
they practise self-restraint in drought seasons. My
own observations during several years of burrow
mining satisfied me that during dry times Mrs.
Bunny suffered abnormally from a complaint suspi-
ciously like contagious abortion, resulting, as I
supposed, from an enforced diet of dry food.
“Spadger”: This winter’s snow caught
many herds of stock still in the mountains in
southern N.S.W. Drought conditions were so pre-
valent on Monaro that owners wanted to leave
their cattle and horses out as long as they pos-
sibly could. The result was that many are still
unmustered,’ and a large number starved in the snow.
One man, on snowshoes (no other method of loco-
motion being practicable!, found a mob * i his
horses in a gull.V, their manes and tails p ticked of
every hair. A filly that had died of the cold had
been so cleaned that she was as fine a specimen as
the hairless horse that used to draw crowds at
country shows some years ago. Some of the prads
whose tails had not provided food for their fellows
were found with their rear decorations frozen tight
in the snow r .
“Universal”: For the last few years I
have dodged the tropical malarial fever mainly by
avoiding over-exhaustion from any cause, eating
when I feel hungry,
and—most important
of all —by not court-
ing sudden chills
through getting out of
bunk during the cold
part of the night or
rising early in wintry
weather. It is nearly
always chilly in the
morning (don’t take
any notice of the boss’s
sarcastic remarks).
Avoid most carefully
cold bathing in any
form; take your bath
in the heat of the day.
(This cold-bathing fad
causes 80 p.c. of tropi-
cal sicknesses.) As a
cure for fever, take hot.
drinks —strong ones if
you can—and quinine
with acid to dissolve
it rapidly, especially
if in tabloid form, and
then get into a mass
of bedding previously
warmed before a fire,
and have a footwarmer
(hot stones will do).
If you are going to be
cured, you must sweat
and sweat. After the
chills have gone, take
a hot bath, avoid get-
ting cold and slip back
to a warm bunk. Avoid
eating- meat for a few
days when the appetite
returns. Incidentally,
if the fever visits you
when in a southern
clime, tell the doctor
the cause—he may
otherwise call it influ-
enza. 1 have been
through the mill a
score of times, and
25 years of experience
is behind these tips.
“Boundary Rider 32”: Kangaroo-shooting
just over the fence in Queensland a few days ago,
my companion blazed at a red “old man.” The ’roo,
apparently unhurt, went at top speed for 327yds.
(we stepped it later) ; then he toppled over, as
dead as last year’s fashions. Upon examination we
found that the bullet, a .32 Winchester, had com-
pletely burst the heart. If anyone can tell me how
that hopper managed to sprint the distance he did
with his heart literally shattered, I’ll be extremely
grateful, for the strain it has imposed upon my
thinkery is proving too severe.
“Jimmy Possum” : Here’s a way of cook-
ing johnnie-cakes or small dampers which requires
neither ashes nor pounded-up coals, besides en-
abling a clean loaf to
be turned out. Hav-
ing mixed your dough,
flour well your frying-
pan or billycan-lid (or
a sheet of bark the size
of a frying-pan cut
from a bulge on a
tree, if you’re short of
cooking utensils) and
clap in the johnnie.
Then prop the pan up
ag-ainst the fire at an
angle of about 20 de-
grees with a stick, and
rake a few coals be-
hind it. As soon as
the side facing the fire
has crusted over, re-
verse the johnnie and
toast the other side
till it hardens. Then
keep turning' it occa-
sionally till thoroughly
cooked. The result
will be a loaf clean
and appetising. Most
of the old boys I’ve
met, by the way, have
called johnnie-cakes
“blanks on the coals,”
and some of the cakes
I’ve seen turned out
were blanks, too.
“Slushlight”: Noticing a rabbit in trouble
the other day, 1 got off my horse to see what was
up, and was (surprised to find a shingle-back lizard
hanging on to Bunny’s ear. The lizard had been
dragged about a bit, but it seemed well able to
hang on. I j had to prise its mouth open with a
stick before it would let go its grip. The curious
part, of the business is that these lizards are
vegetarians, >o it couldn’t have caught the rabbit
for tucker. iPerhaps the crawler had a bad liver
or —well what could a shingle-back and a rabbit
quarrel about ?
“Boundary Rider 32”: I know a carrier,
Henry Green, of Brewarrina (N.S.W.), who owns a
dandy draught more. Unkempt and ugly and ex-
tremely poor owing to drought, she had little difficulty
in shifting from the loading-stage at Brenda sbeu
a load of wool of six tons. When you consider the
tare of the waggon (three tons), and allow foi
the “dead” nature of the road (1-Mn. deep black-
soil crust), the performance becomes a fairly decent
one for a single prad.
“Elingarali”: At R. Perrott’s property at
Kaban (N.Q.) two otherwise perfectly ladylike cows
fell out and came to blows. One was gored through
the eye and brain, and the other, unable to disen-
gage her horn, fell with her victim and broke her
neck.
A. S. le Souef, Taronga Park, sums up:—
Although all the facts about the way young mar-
supials are brought into the world are well known
to science, there is still a great deal of doubt in
the lay mind. This arises, firstly, from the fact
that the young are born in a very immature state,
so very much smaller than the babies of any other
animal, and, secondly, they cannot be detached from
the nipple without rupturing the wee mites’ mouth
parts. The average observer would say that the
little naked being coul'd not stand exposure to the
open air, and is too small and helpless to attae 1
itself to the nipple, even if placed in position by'the
mother. Further, when it is seen that it is so firmly
fastened, and after removal that the lips are torn,
it is at once concluded that it grew there from
the first. However, consider the facts in order and
see what we get:
Dinkurn Item No. /.—Dissection shows that tho
four nipples of a kangaroo ale connected with a
mammary gland, which is just like that of any other
mammal. The gland is supported by the skin, and
is quite free from the abdominal wall. There are
no passages leading from it in any direction.
Incontrovertible Fact No. 2. —Female marsupials
have peculiar sexual organs, somewhat different from
those of other animals. Each organ is, however,
absolutely self-contained. The ovary cannot do other-
wise than travel to the oviduct, where, if impreg-
nated, it develops. From there it can go only to
the external opening. There is no means of escape
in any other direction —certainly, none in the direc-
tion of the pouch. Many specimens observed in
situ prove that the young do develop inside the
mother, and, when sufficiently matured, are born like
any other animal.
True Bill No. 3.— What happens after this has
been related by many reliable witnesses. AVe have
records from Perth, Victoria, Queensland, New York,
Philadelphia, etc. The mother sits with her tail
bent forward between her legs, and the young- is born
on to the soft hair at the base of this appendage.
From this point onwards there are some curious and
unexpected happenings. The first is that the parent,
beyond cleaning up the extruded fluid, takes not
the slightest interest in the baby. The second point
is even more extraordinary, for the tiny, naked and
seemingly helpless mite shows that it is endowed
with strength, activity and inherited sense. The
diminutive creature immediately begins to climb;
instinctively it goes upwards. As one arm moves
forward the little head swings to that side and
nuzzles into the fur, then the same movement is
repeated cn the opposite side. The youngster soon
reaches the pouch and takes hold of the nipple, which
it has been industriously searching for. The nipple
is at this time short and firm, and the tip easily
slips into the tubular mouth of the young one.
Once there the moisture makes it swell, so that it
A MATTER OF EMOTTON.
OLD CLIENT : “Here, .waiter, this will never do—this steak is not
nearly tender enough.”
WAITER (who has just got the sack) : “What do yon expect? Did
you want it tender enough to kiss yer ?”
becomes rather firmly embedded in the mouth cavity
and holds the little thing securely in place. This
is the reason why the young cannot be removed
without tearing the lips. Dissection proves that the
attachment is purely mechanical and not physical.
As it grows the weight of the baby causes the nipple
to elongate—in the ease of a kangaroo it may reach
an inch in length. The youngster “stays put” for
several weeks, and does not leave the pouch for about
four months. If the young of any marsupial is
examined at birth, it will be seen' that the fore
limbs are comparatively well developed, and that
the fingers are furnished with sharp claws. These
claws are perfectly adapted for their purpose, that
of grasping fur, and so the journey to the pouch is
readily made.
THE DIRGE OF A CHEERFUL CORONER.
[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
“In response to an invitation from a provincial
coroner in England to intending sifieides to lay t leu
troubles confidentially before him instead ot taking
their lives, a queue of people waited on nun. int}
were received individually, and left looking mo
cheerful.” —Potted cable.
The coroner, a human chap.
Surveying victims of mishap
In rigor mortis , tired grew.
“This task becomes monotonous,”
He cried in accents querulous:
“The people to my house should come
And tell me of their troubles glum
Ere they decide on cyanide—
I'm sick of all this suicide.”
(The pressmen’s pens o’er paper flew.)
In print appeared at six next day
His counsel re another way
To those who hopelessly life view.
At eight, before his domicile,
Lined up, for long mile after mile,
Were crippled soldiers, spindleshanks,
Victims of dope and carping cranks.
Poor worn-out croaks and jilted blokes,
And “lost-at-races” stony-brokes.
Awaiting him in endless queue.
That coroner for Weary hours
Exerted philanthropic powers
From suicide to save each gent.
He started off quite cheerfully
And taught the victims how to be
With hope aglow and pulse a-tlirill
And not of life to think so ill.
From death retrieved, they well received
His words of wisdom, and believed
They were not broke, but merely bent.
The morn to noon and eve soon passed ;
Without, the shades of night fell fast.
Still from his house the good man sent
Each victim reconciled to life,
Prepared anew to face its strife.
On him their burdens told their tale ;
His eyes sank in, his cheeks grew pale.
They found him dead beside his bed
Their troubles worried him instead,
And so he to the angels went.

OVERLAND LEADS.
The OVERLAND driven by Messrs.
E. Croysdill and V. Allerton used
SHELL MOTOR OIL and SPIRIT
exclusively in their Fremantle-
Sydney (via Perth, Adelaide and
Melbourne) RECORD RUN.
Read what Mr. Croysdill says of the Oil
and Spirit:—
Messrs. The British Imperial Oil Com-
pany, Melbourne, Victoria.
Dear Sirs, —
Many thanks for your congratula-
tions. Car ran splendidly, thanks to
“Shell.”
The oil was splendid, considering the
engine often had to be run continuously
in first and second gear for a distance of •
30 to 40 miles. Not once was there the
least sign of overheating or carbonising.
It was not found necessary to drain the
oil from the engine, with the exception
of the time we unfortunately fell into
a creek, when we had to dismantle the
engine to remove all the sand and water.
On every occasion the oil filter was
examined it was found to be clean, con-
clusively showing that the oil is clean
and free from impurities.
“Shell” Motor Spirit again proved its
quality, as we averaged over 28 miles
to the gallon, in spite of the heavy pull-
ing we experienced in South Australia
and Victoria.
Yours faithfully,
(Sgd.)
“Shell” has always signified —The
World’s Standard in Motor Spirit.
Now it means more; it means also
the highest-grade of Lubricating Oil
made.
The “Shell” standard is inflexible.

3100 Miles of Desert Sand Drift, Rocky Ranges

Captures Australia’s
THE attempt on the Fremantle-Adela id e-Mel bourne- Sydney record was
planned to prove that a practically standard Model 91 OVERLAND,
selling at the remarkably low price of £295, using DUNLOP CORD
TYRES, SUELL OIL and MOTOR SPIRIT, and equipped with PYRENE
tire extinguishers, had an inbuilt stamina sufficient to withstand trials a
hundred times more severe than the average owner encounters during the
lifetime of his car. To crowd a mileage of six months’ customary driving
into the space of a week, and to prove that the Engine, Steering, Ignition.
Axles, Wheels, Springs, Oiling System, and, indeed, every part of the
OVERLAND is built with an extraordinary margin of reserve strength which
gives it the right to claim to be the World’s Greatest Motor-car Value.
THE BEGINNING OF THE RAIN.
four hundred miles before Adelaide was reached pouring rain was
encountered, and the time schedule was slowed down considerably, while the
car plugged its way through stretches of flood and bog for the next 950
miles with all the discomforts of continuous rain and sodden tracks resulting
through it, and on top of the fearful strain under normal conditions the
drivers gave a remarkable demonstration of bulldog pluck and tenacity, which
has never been surpassed in the history of Australian motoring. The dreaded
• Coorong Desert was passed on Friday morning. The run from Adelaide to
Melbourne, through mile upon mile of flooded country, took 34 hours, over
a 5T9 miles stretch, for which a similar model Overland at present holds the
speed record of 14 hours 51 minutes.

DESPITE FLOODS, THE OVERLAND PRESSES ON.
The daily newspapers report that the floods in Victoria in parts were the
greatest since 1900. All sporting features, including the Caulfield Races in
Melbourne, were postponed last Saturday, yet at midnight that night the
Overland left on the last stretch to Sydney. The low-lying country round
Albury was submerged, heavy snow falls melting had swelled many of the
creeks; in one case a bridge had been washed away. The Overland tool; to
the water, but was submerged, and further delay was occasioned by the
necessity of taking the engine to pieces to get the water out.
At 9 minutes to 8 on Monday morning, 15th October, the Record-breaking
Overland was “clocked in” at the Sydney G.P.O. by Royal Automobile Club
Officials.
Under the most favorable weather conditions this Record, by one ot the least
expensive cars in the world, would have been a Remarkable Test of Endurance. Vvitli
the natural difficulties of distance and bad tracks, multiplied many times by half the jour-
ney of 8000 miles being converted into stretches of swamp, bog and water-filled pot-holes,
the achievement becomes phenomenal, a tribute alike to the grit of the drivers and the
efficiency of the car. _
TO THE PRIVATE BUYER.
To the private owner and to the intending car buyer this marvellous
Test of OVERLAND’S ENDURANCE, in which a mileage of half a
year and strains and stresses a hundred times greater than those an
average car meets in a lifetime were crowded into one week, proves
that in the Overland he gets ruggedness, power and efficiency, which
would be cheap at any price, but the more remarkable when it goes
with a car which gives over 30 miles to the gallon of petrol consistently,
and sells at only £295.

A WOMAN'S
LETTER
ROGER
GALLET
Government House is given over to tlie
painters and puttiers, who are to furbish it
up for the De Chairs. The family will pro-
bably leave England by the Mooltan, which
is expected to reach Sydney on her maiden
voyage at the end of February. After
the repairs Government House will be closed
until the arrival of the new occupants.
The mere name doesn’t shoo off the ordi-
nary male, judging by the roll-up to the
Feminist Club's Powder and hatches Ball
the other evening at the Wentworth. Club
members had slipped into the panniers, the
powdered wigs and the patches of the period
when lovely woman ruled man by wit and
the turn of her waist. But waists and
curves are gone as surely as the bewitching-
patch, and the laced bodice loses something
of its old-time charm when worn above tin 1
expanded ribs of the modern Kitty Bellairs.
Still, the ball was one of the most stimulat-
ing of the season —everybody looked happy
instead of bored. Miss Preston Stanley was
a flashing-eyed Lady Teazle in buckled shoes
and pink brocades: with tall cane and chintz
panniers. Mrs. B. E. Minns looked as though
she had just stepped from the pump-room
at Bath; and the silk of Mrs. John Ewell’s
frock had been woven by the Spit al fields
looms —it was of that blue between sky and
royal which is sometimes found in Chinese
glazes; the wide sleeves were lined with sar-
sanet, and its stitchery was a triumph of
handwork. The Waley knight and his lady
brought a party that included the Roystonb
Davey couple and their own girleens, Eileen
and Cecile, the willowy Eileen in a frock
whose bodice was black and close fitting, and
whose skirt was billowing white lace. Mrs.
Willie Anderson was one of -the evening’s
good-lookers in a mustard-colored creation ;
Ruby Rich in a curled white wig and blue
and-gold brocades plucked a prize, as did a
blue-and-bronze brocaded Charlotte Corday;
the shipping Gordon couple were present, she
in silver tissue wrappings like a Parisian
bon-bon ; and the Freyer youth, whose im-
personation of Oscar Asclie won him a prize
two weeks ago, came out as a ripping Beau
Brummel, and was again among the victor’s.
The Charley Lloyd-Jones couple (he and
B. E. Minns and Mrs. Woolf, of Perth,
passed judgment on the costumes from the
balcony above) entertained a party, Mrs.
Jones swathed in blue and silver.
The Naturalists’ Society turned on the
most interesting show of the week. It ran
for two days, and its popularity was such
that it might easily have made a 44-hour
week of it. The Gallery of the Education
Department simply blazed with the glory
of wild flowers, among which the Sturt-pea
from Broken Hill and the magnificent waratah
were easily the belles. Shyer beauties from
Queensland and Westralia and the Cataract
district blushed charmingly, and lured
memory down the old creek track whose
treasures were ours in far-off school days.
Orchids were here, and bottle-brush, and
tiny bell-like flowers resembling heather, and
just as great luck-bringers to an Australian.
The Jewish War Memorial Hall, opposite
Green Park, in Darlinghurst, is all ready
for opening on November 11; Armistice Day
will be remembered even to the point of
making the eleventh hour the time for the
ceremony. The place has large ambitions:
it runs to reading-rooms, library, gymnasium
and every convenience for the Jewish social
centre which the Chosen hope to make of it.
A section suitable for dances or concerts is
to be known as the Maccabean Hall. John
Monash (salute!) will do the opening.
General Monash has, by the way, inti-
mated that when he comes to Sydney to open
this War Memorial Hall, a ceremony which
might easily be made, an occasion for the
airing of uniforms, he will wear “civvies.”
Rut, then, Monash is Monasli. There are
other warriors whose war service would be
promptly forgotten if the public wasn’t con-
stantly reminded of it.
The fete to help the building fund of St.
James’s, Turramdrra, had picturesque sur-
roundings. The stalls were arranged about
the paths of the] wide, old-fashioned garden
of Kouhra.; and Hinder their spreading gay
awnings were piled with merchandise from
ice-cream to mercery; Mrs. Walter Swinson
skippereji the argonaut, and her first mate
was Mrs. T. R. Bavin ; and as a vice regal
blessing was murmured by Chief Justice
Cullen's lady, their buccaneering was within
the law. Headmaster of “Shore” Grammar
loaned liis wife to the cake-stall for the after-
noon ; Mollie Fitz Simon led a jolly pierrot
side-show: there was a jazz tent; and, in
spite of the scudding clouds, tea was served
under the glowing fragrant gums.
I). S. Jackson. M.H.R., gave the Austra-
lian Inland' Mission a lift on Monday night
with a talk about what he’d seen and heard
as a member of the Public Works Com-
mittee in its wanderings across Australia.
The lecture, which was illustrated by a hun-
dred fine slides, drew a packed Town Hall,
so there should be a bit towards bringing one
oi the A.I.M. hospitals a bit closer to out-
back pioneers. The main objective of the
Mission is to drop nursing-homes about the
interior of the continent so that no settler
shall be more than 100 miles from one of
them. At the present time there are fami-
lies whose nearest doctor is 550 miles away,
and this in country where the only transport
is by horse or camel. Here men have to
ride a hundred miles to send a wire—and
then find that beer is ss. a bottle! And yet
it might be fruitful country: the camera
found gardens in the very heart of the “arid
wastes, ’ where pumpkins and onions bloomed
even as the rose of Sharon.
Tin' heavens added their thunders to three
of the big weddings of last week. From
early morn Thursday had been overcast, and
after sulking for hours the clouds sent down
their deluge in the evening. Marie Sheeky.
of Yass, became Mrs. Tlirosby Young in the
midst of the disturbance. St. Mary’s was
the trysting-place, and the knot-tying was
done with neatness b’y Father Tansey, a
youthful R.C. padre with a wonderful wave
in his front locks. The young bride and her
two maids, Tootles Williamson and Molly
Palmer, made a picturesque group, Marie
wearing billowing skirts of ivory satin
topped by a froth of lace that the dress-
maker’s art had turned into a bodice: and
over this cascaded a Spanish lace veil lent
by Tootles Williamson. The two attendants
suggested Pavlova in her swan effects as
they cruised up the aisle in their- spreading-
frocks of white tulle over satin. Their
white satin hats bloomed with gardenias, and
each flew an old-fashioned sash. The bride-
groom, Oliver Tlirosby. was supported by his
trusty allies, Jim Inglis and Wallace 1 Hors-
ley. Nearly 200 guests received the cordial
hand from the bride’s father and aunt in
Sargent’s new ballroom, where the wedding
ebook was wrenched from its wishbone in
the intervals of jazz.
Sargent’s, Ltd., had a wedding in the
family last week; the bridegroom, Frank
Hartley Sargent, is a grandson of Mrs.
George Sargent, and that lady’s home, Hart-
leyhope, was the scene of the big cake-cut-
ting. The matrimonial fetters were pain-
lessly fastened by Archdeacon D’Arcy Irvine,
at St. Michael’s, Vaucluse, which had been
turned into something resembling a Spring-
flower-show by the girl friends of the bride.

changed her name in a frock of misty geor-

made up an attractive group.

Yellow is no longer the symbol of the
forsaken. It is becoming a favorite shade
with brides. Betty Hardy, of Double Bay,
chose it for her wedding garment, which was
fashioned of gold lace and built on straight,
slim lines. The young man in the case was
Edward Keep (he’s a grandson of the foun-
der of the firm of John Keep and Son),- and
the wedding was staged at St. Stephen’s in
the presence of a church full of guests.
Bride’s sister Doris and ’groom’s sister
Phyllis bridesmaided in quaint garbings of
green taffetas sprinkled with pink rosebuds,
and Edward Sandy and Dick Hardy stood
by the bridegroom. The Australia spread
the feast.
When this letter was just thinking of
getting into its little pink shawl. Myee Chance
became Mrs. Hugh Ward, of Cumberland
(Eng.). Myee. who is the daughter of the
Naval-Connnander Chance couple, met her
young man in England two years ago, just
before the family’s return to Australia; but
firm parents would not hear of a marriage
for two years. Tuesday, however, saw the
pair, having attained their majority, step-
ping down St. James’s aisle after being
securely made one by family-friend Padre
E. M. Baker, headmaster of King’s School.
Myee, who hoisted all the usual bridal bunt-
ing, is pretty and fair, with blue eyes: her
handsome mother in her day was Maude
Gowlland, one of Sydney’s beauties —a
daughter of that Commander Gowlland who
was drowned in Sydney Harbor. A family
group—Hixsons, Geoffrey Fairfaxes and
Fishers—gathered at the Australia to eat the
wedding rations. Bridegroom, incidentally,
is a son of the late Commander Ward, R.N..
so the knot-tying was quite a quarter-deck
affair. The Ormuz takes the Hugh Wards
to England.
Say how d’you do to Alfred Coffey, the
man who has caught the glamor of our
South Coast beaches and transferred their
gold and turquoise to his canvas. The artist
is an old pupil
of St. Aloys-
ius’s and a
Royal Art So-
ciety student
with three or
four yea r s’
European pol-
ishing. Inci-
dentally, it will
interest Maori-
landers to
learn that he
gathered th e
material for
his first big
show in Syd-
ney during a
tour of the
Shivery Is-
lands • and it
was from this
gathering that
the National
Gallery bought
its first Alfred Coffey canvas. Since then it
lias added several pastels and etchings, and
two paintings from his recent exhibition in
Farmer’s Gallery—an exhibition composed
mainly of well-handled Javanese scenes.
Girlie Toohey’s engagement to Captain
Justin Pagiter, of Africa, is causing a mild
flutter in and about Darling Point. Girlie
is an attractive young thing with a voice
as creamy as the froth on the ancestral ale.
Girlie’s mother, Mrs. Jack Toohey, is some-
thing of a beauty in her own right—a Rom-
ney type. Mother and daughter go to Africa
for tlie wedding, which will take place early
next year.
Another Sydney girl facing matrimony is
Kathleen Read, a chick of the Yero Reads,
of Woollalira. The young man’s name is
Henderson, and he sells law in Sydney.
Artist B. E. Minus’s wife, aided and
abetted by a capable committee, was respon-

Wentworth for the benefit of Leah Scott, ;)
Sydney singing-girl in London, who is said
to be the possessor of a World voice. Leah,
who left on her travels without the usual
testimonial concert because of ill-health, will
he greatly surprised by the cheque, which
will be as heartening as a coo-ee from home.
Another November is drawing near, and
veteran organiser Maggie Thwaites is. stage-
managing her annual sale of work at the
Ryde Home for Incurables on the 10th. Last
year these gallant patients who make a big-
effort every year to help themselves cleared
£lOll. This year their ambition soars to
£llll. The vice-regal Cullens are opening
the function. Motors will meet both trains
and steamers ; you take the train to Meadow-
bank station.
An out-back country town named Woop
Woop sprang into being last week in the
basement of the Town Hall. The architects
were the Y.M.C.A., and the takings went into
Y. Emma’s treasury. No ordinary bazaar
this—it was a real wattle-dab settlement,
with a post-office, a lock-up, a bank and a
cash-and-carry department. Mrs. Earle
Page gave the township an official push-off
on its March-hare career, and brisk busi-
ness kept the Keystone Comedy shops going
till the end of the week.
There’s to be a fete in the grounds of
Tressillian, the Motliercraft Training Home,
run by the Royal Welfare Society. Tres-
sillian believes that charity begins at home,
so the fete is in aid of itself.
Winding sheets and grotesque caps are
to disguise everybody at the Halloween festi-
vities at the Wentworth. There are to be
witches and spells and a Sir Roger, and at
the end of that you dance with the person
nearest you.
The Sydney Hospital Auxiliary dispensed
tea and statistics in the ballroom of the
Wentworth on Monday afternoon. It was
the Auxiliary’s annual meeting, and the
chief theme of discourse was the great ad-
vantage of direct giving by subscription—so
much better for the hospital, everybody
agreed, than dependence on hazardous enter-
tamments. The vice-regal Cullen lady pre-
sided ; and speeches, mostly laudatory, issued
from the McMillan dame, president John
Stinson, Mrs. Garland and Dr. Worrall.
Secretary Mrs. Watson Holdship started
gallantly to read a report that looked like
a Treasurer's Budget, struggled gamely for
hve minutes, then gave up in desperation;
whereon copies of the report were handed
around with the sugar-basin.
Over £220 drops into the coffers of St.
Duke’s Hospital as a result of last month's
hall. Mrs. Roystone Davey gave an 11
o clock cheerio at the Wentworth to celebrate
the cheque-giving, and the large committee
turned up and absorbed long, cool drinks in
the intervals of congratulation.
Dr. Thompson, who got a decision against
the B.M.A. the other day. and has since
won two other lawsuits, has a knack of
winning affection as well. Last week liis
admirers gave him a testimonial in the fohn
of a supper-dance, and literally linndrdds
turned up. He’s quite a young man, jjjy
tlic way, and not a bit self-assertive; afld
he has an attractive wife who looked divided
between smiles and tears.
Miles Franklin, who left Australia shortly
alter “My Brilliant Career" was published
(and that was before the present century
dawned), will land back in Sydney a few
days hence. A yearning to see mother again
has impelled the visit.
Mrs. Emily Pilcher, who died lately at
Orange, was the widow of G. de V. Pilcher,
a solicitor of the western town, and daughter
of Charles MacPhillamy, of Orton Park.
Her husband was a son of lncledon Pilcher,
who practised as a solicitor in Maitland 90
years ago. Another son, the weighty C. E.
Pilcher, K.C., married a daughter of John
MacPhillamy, of Mount Tamar, near
Bathurst.
• A Sydney friend lias received a letter from
1 ercy Grainger, written on his way to
America from London. He is returning to
the platform after an absence of over a
year. In the interval the young Australian
has been composing hard, and has made
arrangements to have all his output pub-
lished in Austria and Germany.
A Brisbane postscript:—
I achts, motor-launches, dashing hydroplanes and
flat-bottomed punts careered, jogged or ambled about
New Farm reach as part of Brisbane’s Henley, and
the park was filled with dust and summer frocks.
At nig-ht about 7000 people gathered beneath the
Chinese lanterns and swinging electric lights along
the shore, while fireworks excited the calm skies and
a wireless concert flowed from the band-stand. Sir
Matthew arrived in the afternoon, and was met by
president Gill and Mayor Diddams. Whatmore’s
craft, Narwonah, housed the vice-regal party', which
included Grace Deshoii, of Mitchell Downs, and Capt.
Hammond. Also on board were the Corrigan;.
) eter t Joining's and Sieviers, the Thomason and
McManus ladies, a bunch of girls, Norman Pixley
and R. H. Gill. . The Ena held the Mayor and
councillors. On the Gwendolyn the sportive ukulele
sounded, and the Robbinses and Mrs. Thorpe had
parties aboard their luggers.
Mrs. E. D. White (Bluff Downs) has been shelter-
ing awhile at Government House, and Mrs. Hubert
Fairfax also stayed there before passing on to Cress-
brook.
There was an outburst of tennis at Government
House the other day in honor of the engagement
of Nell Tully and H. Mort. The clans of hoth
parties were largely represented, and there were also
there the Bruches, Glyn-Connollys, Macdonalds, Cecil
Palmers and a host of unattached girls with captains,
lieutenants and a sprinkling of doctors.
The Trocadero was full of butterflies, social and
paper-gilt, for the fairy butterfly ball got up by
Mrs. Ted Theodore. Kiddies in fancy dress absorbed
the floor for the first half c.f the night; then age
came into its own. His Ex, arrived soon after 9,
bringing with him the Hubert Fairfax and E. D.
White ladies, Grace De-lion and Capt. Hammond.
Ethel Sandilands, in ivory brocade, took Joe Power
for better or worse in St. Stephen’s Cathedral, whieh
was all- watsonia, asparagus fern and white satin
ribbons for the event. Father Lane tied the knot,
and Harold Power, of Sydney, best-manned. The
National Hotel saw the after-shivoo. The ’groom is
a son of the late Virgil 'Power.
olande Garraway, a Queensland girl, who escaped
the earthquake in Japan, has just accepted the regu-
lation promissory ring from Wedderburn-Bisshop,
now of Kobe but erstwhile of Hampshire. Yolande,
a very pretty girl, was born somewhere in the very
far north of Queensland.
Sir Matthew went to hear George Sampson play
the organ in St. John’s in aid of the Seamen’s Insti-
tute, and a large section of the general public went
too.. And they were glad they did.
That gifted gentleman with the Phil May streak of
hair over his musical brow, Erich Johns, took the
Elite Theatre for his students’ recital. Scott
Macallum fiddled, Drover ’celloed and Victor James
sang bass; and among those who clapped were the
Theodores, McCawleys and the A. F. Seotts, the
A. P. Greenfield and Malcolm Cameron ladies, Dr.
Brunnich, and many girls from Lourdres Hill.
X.S.W.’s new Governor had a brother in Queens-
land, who married Mary Yeates, of Boondoon, Charle-
ville, arid left two daughters, one of whom married
into the church the other day, her partner being
William Johnstone, of St. Cuthbert’s, Adelaide.
Olive Haseler, who is to marry naturalist A. H.
Chisholm next month, had a tea given in her honor
at Lennon’s by Mrs. William Buicock, in a setting
of crimson and pink carnations and many roses.

Accidents will happen, and the germs of skin-
disease are always round about us. To be fore-armed
with Zam-Buk is a wise precaution.
Whether it be a simple injury, a worrying outbreak
of rash or pimples, or a painful attack of eczema or ulcers,
Zam-Buk is equally indispensable. Of herbal origin,
Zam-Buk has antiseptic, healing and soothing properties
all associated in the purest and most effective manner
possible.
Zam-Buk makes and keeps a wound or sore clean and
healthy, whilst its unique healing properties ensure the
growth of new skin. The skin that is once made healthy
by Zam-Buk has the best chance of keeping free from
future troubles.
Another advantage of Zam-Buk is that it keeps its
medicinal power indefinitely. No matter how long you
keep a box of Zam-Buk, it will never turn rancid and
useless like common ointments and salves, made up of
animal fats and mineral drugs.
You cannot afford to be without Zam-Buk, the healer
which safeguards your everyday injuries against festering
and blood-poison. Zam-Buk is also invaluable for
k
1/6 and 3/6 per Box, of all Chemists and Stores.
Eczema, Bad Legs, Piles, Ringworm,
Children's Sores and Rashes, Boils
and similar skin affections. Get a

Our Earl and Countess, with daughter
Helena, who came back by the Orsova, are
again installed at the vice-regal shack at
Malvern, which was furbished up after being
used for a day for the wedding feast of Trixie
Irvine and J. H. Morrison. His Ex. has
become interested in broadcasting, and don’t
be surprised if lie and the younger boys set
up a medium-sized wireless apparatus some-
where on their 14 acres.
The Collins-street kirk was white-blos-
somed and filled to the last pew when Acting-
Governor Irvine handed his elder daughter,
Beatrice, to James Morrison, of Tasmania.
The bride was in sleeveless white cr§pe,
backed with a floating length of filmy bro-
cade enmeshed with golden threads, over a
pink lining, the whole curtained by great-
grandmother Irvine’s voluminous Limerick
lace bridal veil, which trailed to the train-
hem over an undermisting of white tulle, and
was anchored above with a coronet head-
dress and listening-in posies of orange-
blossom. Two engaging infants, Anne Mac-
indoe (a Grey Smith grandchild) and the
Ormond Fosters’ chick Gwen, in pale yellow
with primroses wreathing their curls, held
the bridal train, while sister Nancy Irvine
and a Tassie girl. Elspetli Cameron (booked
to marry a Wanliss cousin of bride Beat-
rice), ’maided like twin daffodils in yellow
georgette and flowing tulle veils. Wall-
flowers clamped these veils to their back
hair-coils and wandered giddily over their
left shoulders, while more flowers equatored
the georgette draperies. Leonard Seal, who
had crossed from the Speck to see the bride-
groom through, was aided in his job by
William Irvine, jun. Big Dr. Marshall,
who had christened the bride, was called in
to fix the matrimonial knot.
Afterwards there was a lengthy proces-
sion of cars to vice-regal Stonington, where
the parent Irvines shook hands in the State
drawing-room. White silkiness peek-a-booed
fitfully through a lattice work hooping the
lady’s black crepe hangings, and she topped
off with a black hat that had a blue feather
astern. Healths were drunk in the usual
marquee; Dr. Marshall, in toasting the con-
tracting pair, recalled that the bride had
taken her Bachelor of Science degree before
the good-looking ’groom persuaded her to
forsake another sort of bachelordom for mat-
rimony. At the Irvine table were the bride-
groom's sisters —Mrs. Ferguson (Eng.),
fi-ocked in cornflower-blue silk under a black
hat, and Anne Morrison (Tas.), whose black
headpiece topped clinging folds of white
crgpe de Chine. Mrs. Pitt Rivers was maro-
cained in black under a Paisley hat.
The Irvines are now preparing to trip
off for a few months to S’William’s native
land and thereabouts, taking daughter Nancy
with them. Justice Cussen, who has just
had his Cold Country jaunt, will assume, the
dignity of Acting-Chief Justice in their
absence.
Guineas Day lost some weight in the move
from Saturday’s half-holiday to work-a-day,
wash-a-day Monday. The crowd was top-
dressed with the Nicest people, but as a
dress-parade it missed fire. The eyes of
youth were mostly tucked out of sight under
poke-hat brims, which kept everyone guess-
ing as to who was who. Even the more
mature heads were thatched with droopy
lids. These added to the difficulties of iden-
tification, but helped the wearers to defy
the high cost of parasols. One eye-arrester
was a vivid red frock which looked like a
fancy-dress representation of a boiled lobster.
A terrace trotter caged herself in outsize
white checks with an inky backing, while
another was barred in with loud white
stripes on black silk, reinforced by flapping
fins striped sideways on. Fashion having
pulled down the blind on the flappers’ leg-
display, after showing us that all calves are
not shapely, the young things are now bar-
ing their arms to above the shoulder. At
a first startled glance a brace of damsels with
low-cut frocks and dangling, lanky arms
looked as if they had strayed afield in their
bathing togs.
Chairman Clive Leonard’s fair-haired wife
was browned to a turn in silky marocain,
with a yellow sunset gleaming from a brown
millinery triumph. Mrs. Pitt Rivers, who
was navy-blued from head to ankle, had
tilted back her drooping liat-brim to com-
mand an open vision. Surgeon Alexander
McCormick’s two daughters, down from Syd-
ney, were black-hatted over grey tailorings.
The Harry Payne matron topped a dark
frock with a magpie-colored hat. Handsome
Mrs. Charlie Lyon was draped in navy cloth
with vivid blue-and-gold banding on one side;
and Mrs. Sep Miller was a vision in flattery
champagne georgette, inlet with colored em-
broideries, and a hat that sported ostrich
feathers disguised as the forbidden ospreys.
Mrs. Jim Purves convoyed daughter Valerie,
who dimpled appealingly under a purple lid
which dripped violets on the port side above
a tender green streamer. Mrs. Otway Fal-
kiner was coated and skirted in navy, and
had plumage fronting her big black hat. The
Philip Russell, Winter Irving, Dick Turn-
bull and Everard Browne matrons were
among those quite inconspicuously tailored
and hatted. Mayoress-elect Brunton sported
dark blue marocain, with tangerine-lined
panels and a mammoth ribbon bow athwart
her black hat. Arthur Payne introduced a
whiff of old-time distinction by driving his
pretty little wife to the course in a smarjtly-
equipped four-in-hand, with two liveried
grooms perched on the back seat.
Saturday’s sunshine hatched out the first,
edition of Spring finery at Caulfield, and
tempted a record Cup crowd. The dressing
was a go-as-you-please in the matter of
color and style—billowing skirts jostled
skimpy one-piece sheaths, while magpie
effects toned down the blinding output of
fierce colors and crazy-quilt patterns. The
Gov.-General and his little lot had the right
wing of the vice-regal pen, with Lieut.-Gov.
Irvine and his flock on the other side. Lady
Forster’s dark-blue outfit was topped with
a flowery spray on the liat-ledge, and little
Lady Pat Blackwood (she is sister to old-
friend Lady Doris), still pale after the re-
moval of her appendix, nestled in a corner in
white wool tailorings lightly checked with
black to match her hat. while Mrs. Pitt
Rivers trotted round the birdcage in Paisley
over a black frock. Chairman Clive Leon-
ard’s wife decorated the committee-box, be-
comingly blacked, but with a touch of pale
rosiness in the rucliing inside her hat-brim.
Her mother-in-law beamed on the world
through tortoise-shell glasses: she was in
navy draperies silhouetted with cherry color
on the upper storey. Mrs. Norman Wilson
cheered the official pen with a wine-colored
dress, and Mrs. Harry Payne added a satis-
fying note with rust-red silk, hemmed with
almond green. Leslie MacDonald’s wife
sported black and red in a nice harmony;
and Mrs. Geoff Syme, just off the sick-list,
was arresting in the white silken embroid-
eries over a dusky background, which she
released at daughter Mardi's wedding.
One youthful charmer looked the spirit of
Old Romance in full petticoats of white em-
broidery under a straight-jacket bodice with
pink sash-ends and a little flowered bonnet-
and another, all a fluff of pink under a deco-
rative head-covering, suggested a strayed
lamb from a comic-opera chorus. A well-
proportioned matron took the limelight
swathed gracefully in what appeared to be
an early-Victorian brocaded curtain weighted
with fur; yet another trailed black
velvet m the rear from a white lace frontage
and brown Marabout topped by a grey-
feathered hat converted the wearer into the
likeness of a performing seal. A whole
pamt-a_nd-powder outfit must have been
drained to mask the youthful attractions
tucked away under a canary liat-brim which
bcbbed by the vice-regal enclosure. One
absent-minded beggar puffed a well-nicotined
pipe m the vicinity, while a red-locked young
Irishman straddled an infant athwart his
shoulders in the same exclusive region. A
Montgomery sister bubbled over with the joy
or a £lOO wm, but curtained her smiles when
Mangold came in third in the final event
after leading the field right up the straight.
As tor Mrs. Lee Falkiner, the tortoise-shell
specs shocked her friends from taking sound-
ings of its frocky accompaniments.
The elocutionists are raving over Lucy
Ahon, the charming little Chinese-Australian
who smiles at you from the adjoining photo.

pion of the

Lons from Stephen Leacock, Gilbert’s
Comedy and Tragedy,” “Othello” and
“His House in Order.” Lucy, who
is a pupil of Louis Dunn, has won her
teacher’s diploma at the London College of
Music, and intends to give a recital in the
early future. She will probably remain an
elocutionist, thougn Her countryman, barris-
ter Ah Kety has been pressing her to study-
law. She already has her B.A. degree and
he considers that the LL.B. is well within
hex reach.
Weather having permitted the Bishops-
court lawn frivol, Archbish. Lees and his
wife lined up under the spreading garden
tree to welcome the coming guests—chiefly
social and clerical notabilities. Mrs. Lees
wore dark blue blister inarocain, pleasingly
sleeved and side-panelled with Paisley effects
under a hat of the two blends, and she
smiled over a fragrant posy. An orchestra
provided a nice musical atmosphere in the
middle distance. Tea and cake were spread
in a marquee, and buffets shelved the side of
the house. Acting-Governor Irvine was
there as guest-in-chief; his dame warmed
her grey silk with skunk furs and flew a
black hat. Mrs. Littleton Groom was brown
and yellow, like an autumn leaf; Mrs. Snod-
grass, who came with her Canon, emphasised
her elegance with a black satin sheath, and
Mrs. Harry Emmerton was in mushroom-
colored silk. The Herbert Power widow
radiated attractively in a magpie frocking.
Mrs. McAdam was there with her medical
husband and son, who, despite the gap be-
tween their years, are as like as the Siamese
twins. Canon Hughes and Cyril Barclay
represented the local High Church section.
W. V. McCall, Melbourne’s new Town
Clerk, pictured here by Lafayette, won’t have
to work overtime getting acquainted with the
intricacies of his new duties. He under-
studied Ellery
for nine years,
during which
he was fre-
quently called
on to play the
main part. His
election was a
walk-over—not
a single “No”
slip fluttered
into the ballot-
box. McCall
is simply over-
flowing with
tact, and his
knowledge of
who’s who and
how to place
’em is astound-
ing. Further-
mo r e, his
genius for or-
ganisation
finds him the
king-pin in ail civic function arrangements.
But _ his longest suit is his knowledge of
municipal law, and he is embodying much of
this in a book which is to be launched shortly.
When the_ new T.G. slips the civic chain he
divides his attention between his piano,
his tennis racquet and the pilot’s wheel of a
car.
All the Best Gilded were roped in for the
Government House meeting on Thursday
afternoon, whereat everyone present was in-
vited to help launch a matinee at Her
Majesty’s on Nov. 15, mainly for the Queen
Vic. Hospital cause. The Sydney Reps, are
to be brought over to stage “Pygmalion,”
with Mrs. Pitt Rivers as chief star, and as
the cost of this will be considerable, three
evening performances are listed. The boxes
were all netted at 20 guineas apiece, and
dozens of seats were snapped up at a guinea
each. Later on the left-overs will be marked
down. Some of the takings will go to the
Old Actors’ Assoc, and some to the Rep.
movement, but the bulk will pass to the
Queen Vic. Phil Finklestein, the Tallis
lady and Mrs. Robins are heading the work-
ing committee.
Sheila Nicolson and Charles Nicholas
said “I will” to each other at Toorak St.
John’s the other day. The bride was silver-
armored for the event, and had Limerick
lace on her silvery train. Pearls dripped
heavily from the glittering sash hems, while
silver and orange-blossom entanglements
secured the bridal tulle veiling. Sisters Eileen
Nicolson and Jean Nicholas followed with
more silver glitter over pink underveilings
•>"d a second rosy daAvn in the sash regions,
while pink feathers cascaded giddily over
their right ears from head coverings of
silver. Roy McCaughey had the assistance
of young Fred Knight in looking after the
’groom. The jollo after the ceremony was
spread at No. 9 Darling-street by the bride’s
parents, the Alex. Nicolson pair, one time of
Corowa. Mrs. Nicolson struck a raven note
in black georgette, but brightened it by
ficelle embroiderings under a hat suggest-
ing a pheasant in full plumage, while Mrs.
Nicholas sported a three-decker skirt of
navy pleats, under a plumed and silvered
hat. Mrs. Herbert Lillies, sister of the host-
ess, topped white georgette with a dark blue
lid, while another sister, Mrs. Boyd (they
were Thornleys), trailed filmy green and
black.
The widow of Anzac General Bridges has
now been created a grandmother by the
small boy whom the Stork lately handed to
son Noel. The babe’s father, who laid off
his British major’s khaki after the Big Scrap,
married a Scottish girl, and now earns his
crust in the Straits Settlements.
Officers of the combined fighting forces
shook the moth-balls out of their gladdest
uniforms the other night for their ball in
the Melbourne Town Hall. The ancient in-
terior was walled with red, white and blue,
ana encrusted with assorted war weapons,
while countless yards of tricolor ribbons
blotted out the ceiling. A platoon of the
first brass-caps and their feminine halves
blew in to smile on the affair, which had
Brigadier-General Jess at the head of the
organising committee, and Captain W. M.
Algie as hon. sec. The Chauvel dame was
dove-like in a shimmer of grey silk, and Gen-
eral Coxen’s fair-haired wife, who convoyed
two attractive daughters, was fulled brownly.
with punctuations of china-blue. Mrs. Eric
Harrison’s inky hangings were cheered by
diamente emplacements and a crystal-
beaded coronet of many colors. John Mon-
ash’s daughter, Mrs. Bennett, radiated like
a rising sun in golden yellow. Commander
Cresswell’s wife was entrenched in white
satin under silver lace, which was anchored
on the port side with a pink bow.
The main floors of the Hotel Windsor were
covered to the entrance tiles the other day
with card-players and jazzers, who were
there nominally in the interests of the Queen
Vic. Hospital. Prince’s Amateur Band saw
to it that no one went to sleep—it made
such a welter of the fox-trotting syncopation
that it nearly drowned itself in its own flood
of noise. The Tallis, Robins and Norman
Brookes dames and Adelaide Allan, who
looked nice in blush-pink georgette, were the
mainsprings of the affair. A flower-stall, in
charge of two pretty Cox sisters, some raffle
brigandage, a sweet sector run by Mrs. Wer-
theim and Miss Michaelis, and the vending
of balloons by Mrs. McCallum Neil, all added
to the weight of the cashbox at the finish.
Jennie Brenan helped Mrs. Brookes judge
the fox-trot, and handed the awards to the
Simon Fraser widow and Bruce Mead. The
Mayoress-elect was there with her prospec-
tive wearer of the bunny-skins.
So accustomed have the Argus people be-
come to the notion that wherever the Mac-
kmnon printing-press is there shall the
centre of the city be that, having decided to
shift to Elizabeth-street north, they now want
Melbourne remodelled to match. It isn’t
possible to plant the Town Hall right oppo-
site, but it is proposed to do the next best
thing—sweep away the hospital (recently
rebuilt and equipped at a cost of £400,000)
and put the civic headquarters on the site.
It would then be within a block of the new
Argus office, near enough for the tower to
cast a shadow on the editorial sanctum. The
Pig Market area, on Sydney-road, opposite
the Varsity, is hailed as the ideal site for a
new hospital, although it was rejected 15
years ago, with Argus approval, when its
own (Wilson) trustees supplies £120,000 for
the present hospital buildings.
A little gossip from Adelaide:—
A big cheque should go to the Children’s Hospital
from the Movie Ball at the Palais. Dress was plain
or fancy, and those who donned strange garments
mostly went to the films for inspiration. Ladv
Bridges arrived early in the evening, bringing Miss
Judge and Capt. Hambleton with her. The mayoral
Cohens had a big party in a box, as had the Dun-
can lady, the A. A. Scarfes and 11. R. Corpes.
A dozen or so Parliamentarians were bidden to
meet Mr. Wignall, of the British Migration Com-
mission, across the Government House dinner-table
the other evening. Among them were H. D. Young,
Peter Reidy, A. W. Robinson and J. S. Verran—a
discreet mingling of the very Right and the very
Left.
A handy £BOO is expected from the St. Peter’s
College Mission Ladies’ Guild fete in the college
grounds—a result not altogether surprising seeing
that nearly everyone who had any past or present
association with the college turned up. A company
of St. Peter’s Boy Scouts acted as guard of honor
to Lady Bridges, who gave the show her benediction.
There was tea-and-chatter, plus music, at the
Grand Central the other afternoon, with the Misses
Muecke as hostesses —one in grey and the other in

well and Enid Miller (both from Sydney), and the

W. • A. Yerco and V. M. Newland dames.
There was an echo of old-time entertaining in
another tea given during the week —a musicale
with a definite programme and chairs arranged in
orderly rows. Mrs. Schomburgk and her sister-in-
law, Mrs. J. H. Evans, were hostesses, and the show
was given at the former’s house on South-terrace.
Lionel Lindsay is to put in a week or two with
the Heysens, at Ambleside, while he is in this State
arranging for his exhibition.
Owen Smyth, a staunch battler for the League of
Empire, was welcomed home by his fellow-members
almost as soon as he set foot in the State. The
reunion was billed for the morning in the tea kiosk
on the shores of the Torrens lake; D. J. Gordon was
the League’s spokesman, and the guest’s reply showed
that he’d lost none of his old views or vigor.
Community singers had their last meeting for
this year in the evening, and took the Exhibition
Building for it, with the result that the place was
crammed long before starting time. Popular little
Mrs. Weston, who launched the movement, was given
a reception that threatened the roof of the old
building, and the roar that greeted Evangeline
Shanks, who, as “Jean Duncan,” wrote the Com-
munity prize song, is still echoing thereabouts.

NOT A PENNY FOR REPAIRS.
“I am pleased to let you know the ‘Billabong’ Mill I purchased in 1914
is still working splendidly, giving every satisfaction, and has not cost one
penny for repairs.”— Extract from letter received.
Billabong;
THE GEARED MILL WITH THE RELIABLE SPEED GOVERNOR
The reason for the great durability of the “Billabong” is found in its
massive construction and the great care with which gears and all moving parts
have been fitted. Consequently there is no undue friction, and even a slight
breeze will start the Mill working. The whole mechanism is protected by a
patent speed regulator, which automatically regulates the speed of the Mill
to the velocity of the wind, and stops it altogether when a gale blows.
Bucket-carrying and horse-power cannot compare with wind-power—except
for drudgery and waste of time and money. The Mill for you at a moderate
price. Billabong Pumps and Troughing are just as good and just as
reasonably priced. Write for free Billabong booklet.

The story of the Caulfield Cup was of
how Whittier, last year’s winner, could make no
impression this time on his old pacemaking opponent,
Easingwold, and how the S’Australian mare Wynette
(s’s) had the light weight and lucky run that
left straight-going Easingwold no chance at the finish.
A difference of 32db. against him was too much
for the Westralian, who, judging from his triumph in
the Herbert Power Stakes on the Wednesday, had
been timed to the very week by Holt. Outsider
Yacamunda was quite a good third, and just behind
him were The Tyrant and Whittier, with Happy
Queen, The Cypher and Rivoli next. Whittier
looked blooming—rather too much so, in fact. He
is a horse that requires plenty of galloping, and in
the fateful week that preceded the Cup meeting he
evidently didn’t get enough of it. But Nature, not
the trainer, was responsible for that.
Victorian faith in The Cypher, favorite at the last
moment, dies hard. Eccles’s horse has been a dis-
appointing beast since he made a hack of David in
the V.R.C. Handicap last Melbourne Cup week. He
looked beautiful before and after Saturday’s race, but
never shaped like a possible winner. It was stupid
to pile money oh a notoriously slow beginner in a
12-furlongs go where the pace was certain to be
ding-dong from the start. They hadn’t gone a couple
of furlongs when The Cypher and Backwood were
whipping in the field. Both may be expected to do
better in the Melbourne Cup, .Backwood in particular.
No one who considers the stylish English horse in
all his bearings will discard him on Saturday’s per-
formance. There is no certainty that he has become
properly acclimatised, but his appearance is pro-
mising and on the track he occasionally exhibits
masterly speed. As to his alleged bad temper—well,
he behaved himself well in the birdcage on Saturday,
and the answer to the objection that “he stands
too high on the leg” is that his leg is what it was
in England, where he was a first-rate stayer. At
not less than 10 to 1 the handsome Britisher is worth
a bet, both ways, for Melbourne Cup—much better
worth it. than, say, Whittier, Purser or Easingwold.
The stipendiary stewards showed they were no
respecters of persons by carpeting Brown, Whittier’s
rider, after the Cup, and Connolly, owner of Sun-
hurst, after the Windsor Handicap, in which the New-
market winner ran unplaced. Thereby they grievously
offended the rags that boost fashionable jockeys,
punferg and bookmakers (in the intervals of glori-
fying the “Squizzy” Taylors and Ida Penders) as
enthusiastically as they slander the poor devils who
tome out from a land of misery on immigrant ships,
and who, with rare exceptions, are Great War
veterans and their dependants. Brown was suspended
till after the Melbourne Cup meeting for having
cut across the field too sharply at an early stage
of the big race. In Connolly’s case no action was
taken, Sunburst, it appears, having been kicked at
the start and interfered with in running after being
genuinely backed. This is the second time Connolly
has been questioned by the stewards within the last
six months, and his indignation is tremendous. But,
being- a big punter—the biggest of the lot—-he must
expect to excite more inquisitiveness than the owner
who races for the love of the game. The public
can’t complain of the way Connolly has run his
horses, but, broadly considered, the prevalence cl
these big punters is a bad thing for the turf.
Although the stable is out of luck, Stare is worth
considering for the Moonee Valley Cup on Saturday.
The Earlston horse has come back to form, the dis-
tance suits him, and the course is not too trying
for the hardy, nuggety fellow.
Few Australian racing-men would have
backed Papyrus to beat Zev, or any other American
colt of class, under the conditions of the match at
Belmont Park, N’York, last week. Not that U.S.
form is superior to English form (.it probably isn’t),
but the circumstances were all against the Epsom
Derby winner. He had undergone a severe preparation
for a 14-furlongs race in England on Sept. 12. It
was inconceivable that he could be cherry-ripe for
a 12-furlongs struggle at New York on Oct. 20,
having spent six of the intervening 38 days at sea.
The sea-journey from Melbourne to Fremantle is
comparable to that from Liverpool to N’York.
During the past 20 years many horses which com-
peted at Flemington in late October and early
November have been sent to Perth with the object
of winning big races there in late December and
early January, but very few have succeeded, al-
though the local horses, generally speaking, were of
inferior class. The invaders slackened oft' during the
sea-voyage, and were unacclimatised; hence 95 p.c.
of failures. Take Easingwold, on the other hand.
Highly tried in the West as a two-year-old, he was
brought to Melbourne a young three-year-old and
raced within a few' weeks. He failed horribly. In
the following season, having cantered away with
the Kalgoorlie Cup on August 23, he came east again,
his party having designs on, first, the Toorak Handi-
cap (October 14), and then the Caulfield Cup (Oct-
-21). In each race he ran at least 141 b. below his
proper form. Acclimatised and fit, be has since
proved himself a good horse. Papyrus was un-
acclimatised (more so than Easingwold in 1921 and
1922), unfit, and unused to the clay track on Which
he had to race —he had always galloped on grgss.
To complete his chapter of misfortunes, it rained
heavily the day before the match, and the going
was like treacle. Zev made all the running, and
won, liai’d held, by four lengths, in 2min.
35 2-ssec. He has a lot of St. Simon blood in
him, and is unquestionably a good horse, hut the
race w'as made for him.
“Azac” : Papyrus won the Derby, somewhat luckily
we were told, from Pharos. Some American saw his
opportunity and negotiated for a match, wdth what
U.S. horse it hardly mattered, as he apparently size!
up Papyrus as ordinary. Followed much cheap
puffing for Papyrus, hut he could not live up to it.
and w r as beaten by an unremarkable filly in the St.
Leger (herself has been beaten since) before
entering that 15ft. x 15ft. loose-box. The
scene shifts to the U.S.A. There the Eng-
lish colt’s every move is recorded in a way
that would work up interest in a fight between two
wagtails. Papyrus is always favorite —with the
reporters. How he galloped 10 furlongs in 2min.
6jsec. took a quarter of a column to tell. A two-
line par. told of Zev running the same distance in
2min. 41see. Zev is always favorite with the
betting- men. But i towards the end of his prepara-
tion something happens to him: blotches appear on
his epidermis; by the Great Horned Spoon, bo, he
lias hives. The owner of another champion (there
are 47 altogether) is warned to have his colt in
readiness to dust the earth, so to speak, with the
invader. A railway accident intervenes (it had
to), and the American nation totters on the brink
of disaster. But Zev rises to the occasion. To
the eternal honor of the U.S. racehorse lie magically
sheds his hives. Saddled up by Sambo, the faith-
ful negro servitor, he restores the fortunes of Colonel
Ginsling, the fine old Kentuckian, who fought at
Chancellorsville, and confounds the nefarious tricks
of the Duke of Puddleton-on-the-Sludge by romping
home. He is alleged to have been ridden to vic-
tory by one Earl Sands, but when the moving-
pictures arrive I fully expect to learn that it was
Bella Donna, the Hnllvwood snner-vamn. in disguise.
ONE WAY ONLY.

There are not many better 14.2 ponies
than Jack Marsh, by Son of the Marsh —Mrs. Mala-
prop. Being difficult to train, Jack has been out
of the money for a long time, but he showed a
glimpse of form in a race at the A.J.C. Spring
meeting, and his party backed him for a fairly big
stake (they got 10’s and B’s) against Wrangle, Elkin,
Dunlock and other fair-class sprinters in a six-
furlong handicap at Canterbury Park. The little ’un
won handsomely from Elkin and Mvosotfs in lmin.

placed division was Popaway. who is apparently being
got ready for a race at Christmas time. A very fast
horse on his day, he also is hard to get well.
■■Thirteen'’: In fairness to owners of
horses engaged in races on which there are Tatter-
sail’s sweeps, 1 really must state my case. I have
been subscribing to i’att.’s for 10 years, and, during
that time, not one owner has approached me to
split the prize. The entire fraternity has been most
courteous to me. it is the horses that have been
discourteous. I haven’t drawn a blighter yet.
“Riverina”: I can confirm “W.J.B.’s”
statement (B. 13/9/’23) that a horse can travel a
considerable distance on a cracked leg. In a steeple-
chase at Winton (M.L.) last year two horses fell.
One was pulled up straightway, but the other, a
pony ’chaser named Glenisla, battled over two fences
after the break and finished third! “Broken legs,”
was the vet.’s verdict, and two bullets ended things.
In the case of Glenisla—a magnificent jumper—a
diseased bone had given way, which made his per-
formance all the more remarkable.

Quarter-Slieet ': Many were the tricks

at the old Carrington grounds. The books had been
getting it hot night after night, and squealed, after
the fashion of their tribe. The management watched
its hardest, but still the swindling and the squeal-
ing went on. At length Billy Lees, a well-known
layer, spotted an innocent-looking youth intently
inspecting a frosted window in the dressing-room
under the stand. The youth (and Billy) saw the
tips of three fingers pressed on the frosting inside,
l.ie runner on No. 3 track won. Continuing his
investigations, the amateur ’tec discovered that
tlie youth, by similar signals, could convey the state
oi the betting to the human hounds. In‘the result,
heats were drawn immediately before they wer e run
instead of some time before, as the custom had been,
but the clever crowd soon invented other swindles
and persisted with them until the public got tired
of being robbed. Then the “game” died.

At Melbourne on Saturday night an Aus-
tralian whipi)ed a Filipino—a very uncommon experi-
ence in these days, when the Australian pug is taught
to jazz and spar and the foreign bruiser to punch,
the Aussie was Bill Grime, the Riverina feather-
weight, and the Manilaman Villon, conqueror of
Green, Demsky, Evans and MeFarlane. It took Grime
;-0 rounds to do the trick, but he did it, although
he was a very tired boy at the bell. Also, he had
the tough brown man groggy on one occasion and
might have finished it with a knockout but for
damaging his right hand. Grime is a greatly-
improved youth, and Americans who have seen him
in action reckon him the one Australian glove-artist
likely t° do well in their country. It is his punch
that impresses them.
Only a week or so off the boat, Henry
Dupont, the Belgian lightweight, was in no condi-
tion to meet Butcher, the hard-fighting Westraliau.
at Sydney Stadium, and the towel came in after
the 11th round, the stranger explaining that he
had ‘done ’ees ’and.” He is a fairly good boxer
with a solid smite. He knocked Butcher to the
canvas in the fourth and again in the seventh, but
the Westralian recovered quickly and was a mile
ahead when the end came. It wasn’t a bad fight,
so far as it went, but a management which charges
205., 10s., 55., and 35., plus tax, for its Saturdav-
night shows has no right to inflict a half-fit pug
on its easily-satisfied patrons, even if the latter
are “mugs” enough to stand it.
“Huffin-Guffin”: “Baro” (B. 18/10/’23),
referring to the deadly dulness of wrestling, reminds
me of another form of “sport,” happily gone out of
fashion —the tug-of-war. I was once fool enough—
being young enough—to engage in one of these un-
utterable* competitions. The tournament lasted all
one afternoon and until 11 o’clock at night. Our
team (Vic. mallee wheat-lumpers; they were hefty
men in those days) won every pull. The final lasted
2i hours, and at the finish a cat could have pulled
either team. The audience had all gone home. We
collected £1 a man for eight hours’ killing work,
and I reckon it cost us £5 a head in expenses, etc.,
to win it.
Victorians filled the first four places in
the shoot for the King’s Prize at. Liverpool (N.S.W.).
S. N. Watson, jjf Portland, took the £lOO with an
aggregate of 373 (out of 400) from D. McNaughton
and P. W. Pearce (each with 372) and B. Milne
(371). But Pearce would have won had he shot
even moderately well at 900 yards; once lie failed
to find the target. Very different was the perform-
ance of C. S. Howarth, of Grenfell (N.S.W.), at
the same range in the Newmarch, each of his 10
shots plugging the bull’s-eye.
lii weather that, was much too summery
Essendon won their fifth Vic. League premiership
their first since ’l2. Fitzroy, their opponents, made
a fine game of it, and played more systernatic.i-ly,
but the ’Dons were quicker, better at marking- and
more determined—’Don 63 ; ’Roy 46. Goals are hard
to get when every man knows he is being wed
watched, but Stoekdale managed to snap two more,
increasing his season’s tally to 68, the League record.
The “gate” amounted to £l9ll 9s. Id., bringing the
total for the finals to well over £BOOO. But the
League premiership is a much too long-drawn-out
business; in future it shouldn’t be allowed to extend
beyond September.

‘‘Winkle”: The Melbourne habit of be-
wailing- the degeneracy of football (B. 11/10/’23)
is very old indeed, lit 1871, J. B. Thompson, who
12 years before had been one of the four founders
of the Australian code and of the Melbourne Club,
said that already the game and the players were
decadent. By 1896 things were even worse, according
to critics, and a committee was in that year appointed
to revise the rules. It abolished the right to an
unmolested kick after an idiotic “little mark” (touch-
ing the ball on the toe and throwing it to a fellow-
player), and decreed that the ball was now to be
thrown in from out of bounds (as to-day) instead
of being bounced. There were other improvements,
and still more have been effected since, but the
game remains as degenerate as it was in its vigorous
boyhood 50 years ago.
‘‘Centurion”: To oblige the English Rugby
Union, the M.L. organisation has decided to dis-
continue the “amateur allowance” of 3s. per day' to
touring footballers. Though this allowance is quite
in train with the rules of the Amateur Sporting
Federation, which permits a ss. p.d. allowance to
swimmers and others when on tour, it is utterly
opposed to the principles of amateurism. The cus-
tom, as far as Union footer was concerned, originated
in N.S.AV. about 20 years ago. Before that, tour-
ing teams were found in everything, including wash-
ing, but they had to provide their own pocket-money.
This sometimes led to friction, as in the case of
a famous Maoriland player, who once threatened io
strike in Brisbane, if the manager didn t "hr
him 10 bob. Still, it kept alight the sacred fire
of amateurism. The original All Blacks and Walla-
bies came under the ban of the purists in Britain
because they drew the pocket-money. The S'cots,
always lily-white, were betrayed into giving the All
Blacks a game, but they' drew the line at the
Wallabies, as did Ireland.
* -a-
Sydney batsmen made a poor show on
Saturday’s rain-soddened wickets. K. McCredie, a
colt who played with the juniors last season, leaped
into prominence by -taking 8 for 25 in 7 overs, for
Western Suburbs v. Gordon. Gordon were without
Macartney, who, like Jack Gregory, was nursing a
bad leg. Fast bowler Jack Scott bagged 5 for 33
for Marrickville v. North Sydney. This season he
has captured 17 for 164 in three matches.
“Ex-Englishman”: A. P. Lucas, dead at
66, was one of the astonishing- band of cricketers
produced by Cambridge between 1878 and 1882:
two Lytteltons, two Studds, A. G. Steel, Lucas, M.
B. Hawke and others. What for many years was
reverently recalled as “the Lucas catch” was made
at the single Test-match of 1882 —Australia won
by' seven runs. A hard skimming hit kept low all
the way to the boundary', along which Lucas made
a lengthy run. He was travelling at top speed ns
he crossed the ball’s course, and he gathered it in
about waist-high. It is the only catch I remember
that ever made the crowd, for several overs after,
break out into applause afresh as the fieldsmen
changed over. Ransford did a very similar thing
on the Adelaide Oval in a ’l’est about 10 years ago,
but in his case the ball was dropping when he got
to it.
“Great Elm”: South Australia’s attitude
towards Queensland’s claim to be included in the
Sheffield Shield competition is surely the reverse
of sportsmanlike. South Aus. opposed the idea of
a fourth contestant being admitted on the ground
that its players haven’t the time for travelling as
far afield as Brisbane and cramming two more matches
into the list of first-class engagements. It has
even declined to play' a friendly game with the
Northerners, after its return match against N.S.W.
in Sydney, for the same reason. But the objection-
raising State has cut such a sorry figure itself in
Sheffield Shield competitions these last few years that
the objection comes poorly from it. At all events
it would have much more force if S.A. showed itself
catiable of walloping a Queensland team, between
Sheffield Shield matches, or even ready to try. The
attitude taken up is not a sporting- one, any more
than that of the Murray Bridge oarsmen, who claim
the right to go to Paris next year on their past
achievements and decline a “try-out,” at Melbourne
or elsewhere, on their present form. But the deter-
mination to take no chances at inter-State cricket
is the more invidious, because on last y'ear’s games
South Aus. was quite outclassed in Sheffield Shield
matches.
Williams, the S.A. cricketer, now with
Port Adelaide, had an odd experience at the open-
ing of the season. In a club match, with P.A.
batting, Dolling, who is a doctor, was called away
out of the field, and Williams, who had just finished
his innings, volunteered to field in his place. Soundly
barracked on missing two difficult chances, the sub.
proceeded to catch out four of his own side and
run out another.
In an exhibition quarter-mile swim at
Manly Andrew (“Boy-”) Charlton was beaten by Moss
Christie in smin. 12sec., Charlton being 14 2-ssee.
astern. Which doesn’t look promising for the young-
ster’s Olympic chances, albeit Christie is a greatly-
improved man. Now 16, Charlton is sft. lliiri
and scales just on 13st. It might be wise to spoil
him during the present season and let Nature get on
with its job.
“K.E.”: As “C.W.C.” (B. 11/10/’23)
coached Albert Park’s Big Four of 1887-89 lie cer-
tainly ought to know. However, the printed records
on the walls of the clubroom at the A.P.R.C., also
the late John Lang’s book on Victorian rowing’ give
the following as the Park crew that won the senior
fours at Ballarat in ’B7: 11. Oxlade (bow), S. H
Gowdie (2), A. Chamley (3), W. J. Leverett (stroke)
and H. C. Edwards (cox). This is the crew I re-
ferred to as having placed Albert Park on the row-
ing map. According to the same records. Bill Lev-
erett stroked the crew, when it won at Melbourne in
’B7, Sam Gowdie taking the stroke seat in ’BB and ’B9.
IN BACK WOOD’S YEAH.
[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
“In Backwood’s year,” the Ancient cried,
“in Backwood’s year,
Some jockeys still knew how to ride,
Knew liow to wait and how to guide:
You seldom saw them running wide
In Backwood’s year.
Ah, boys were smart, and men could train;
Each did his best and used his brain
In Backwood’s year.
“At Flemington they had no Tote
In Backwood’s year;
The papers, in that age remote,
Turf market odds could never quote:
The bookies had us by the throat
In Backwood’s year ;
We rushed the joint, as chaps would say,
And took what price they liked to lay,
In Backwood’s year.
“But some of them were badly hit
lii Backwood’s year;
They reckoned lie would not be fit ;
And oh, they cursed his speed and grit.
The winner came in ‘oil the bit’
In Backwood’s year.
These catch terms change as years roll by—
The fancy phrase was “ome an’ dry’
In Backwood’s year.”
He maundered on, that Ancient One,
Of Backwood’s year;
Of how the horses used to run,
The wagers which lie never won,
The mighty deeds he hadn’t done
In Backwood’s year.
And this was long ago, it seems,
The old man only lived in dreams
Of Backwood’s year.
Will future ancients talk indeed
Of Backwood’s year?
Is this a tawdry rhyme to heed
The tip that men so sorely need ?
Will future generations read
Of Backwood’s year?
I know not; 1 repeat again
The words engraven on my brain—
“ln Backwood’s year.”
VICTORIA.

In connection with machine plant it

Safety at high speeds is a necessity
to maximum production, and it is
here that the

The binding action of the steel rims on the cast-iron spyder in the operation of

“Hamer”: Another oldest native-born in-
habitant has been discovered —Mrs. John
Jenkins, of Epping (N.S.W.), who first saw
Campbelltown in May, 1822. She can still
read without glasses, and hasn’t missed using
her vote at an election since women got the
franchise.
Coif’s Harbor (N.S.W.) has lost an old
identity in Mrs. W. T. Pullen, who has died
at the age of 89. A few years ago she and
her husband were photographed in the centre
of a group of 97 descendants. A little later
there were 100 in the clan, but before a fresh
photo could be taken her husband died.
Albert Keeling, who becomes sec. of the
S.A. Alliance, has given all his business life
to that kind of job. lie had a quarter of a
century of it in England, and for the last 10
years has been an organiser in South Aus.
He talks well, and lately turned down an
offer to take a box-seat on the water-waggon
ii N. S. Wales.
"X2X”: An unusual operation was per-
formed at Melbourne Hospital a few weeks
ago, when a young man’s false teeth were
dredged up from his chest, lie had swal-
lowed them while asleep a week before, and
they had lodged just below his windpipe,
where they were located by means of the
X-rays. So far from being rendered hors
de combat by the mishap the patient was able
to travel up from the country for treatment.
“Yacko” : “Zantlius’s” par. about the first
Australian gold coins having been minted in
Adelaide (B. 27/9/’23) recalls that it was
the late Inspector Tolmor, of the S.A. police,
who suggested and organised the gold escort.
The result of this officer’s forethought and
the excellent system he instituted was that
407,1330 z. of gold were conveyed to Adelaide
from the Victorian diggings for a fee not
exceeding Is. 4d. an oz. —when Melbourne
became a competitor it dropped to 6d. an
oz. The gold, valued at £3 Us. an oz., was
subsequently assayed, smelted and lodged to
the consignee’s credit at the bank for a
charge of 1 per cent.
“Kowsara” : Anti-prohibition speaker Bill
Jackson (the man who chained himself
i>o a tree at Townsville so that the police
couldn’t stop him finishing an I.W.W.
speech) was addressing a large open-air meet-
ing in Cairns (Q.) recently when he noticed
a large car worming its way through his
audience. Anti-prohibition was his subject,
but this sight called up the old spirit of
socialism, and, pointing a finger of scorn at
the disturber, Jackson roared: “Comrades
and fellow sufferers, behold one of the para-
sites ! You work and toil so that he and
his kind may live in the lap of luxury.
Brothers, wake up !” The wild laugh that
followed puzzled the speaker, who was un-
aware that he had been roasting a leading-
local hotelkeeper.
“Maske” : Theodore Hooke Hill, now mem-
ber for Oxley in the N.S.W. Assembly, once
had a narrow escape of being Labor member
for Rockhampton (Q.). At that time he
was manager of the Bank of Australasia, and
had a strong hatred for the methods of tne
Denham Government. He refused, however,
to contest a plebiscite among the other
Labor aspirants. The man who won that
ballot and, later, the seat was Frank Ford,
who went on representing Rockhampton
until he ousted Higgs for Capricornia in the
Reps. Hill used to have a high-pitched, even
voice in those days, and was looked upon as a
sound political economist. He resigned from
the anxieties of banking some time back, and
will now continue to sleep soundly o’ nights
as long as Burns, Philp and Co. go on pay-
ing fat dividends.
"George Rich”: I selected a white bone
toothbrush with “Made in England” stamped
on the handle, the brush portion being bored
endways on the curve and the bristles
wedged. Then to the dealer (a personal
friend ) I expressed gratification that Eng-
lish toothbrushes were replacing those or
Japanese manufacture. He promptly shat-
tered my illusion by declaring that the bone
portions of the brushes, after being prepared
and stamped in English factories, are shipped
to Japan, where they are bored, bristled and
wedged. Then, after another sea-trip, the
finished article floats on to . the Australian
market as English-made under the “prefer-
ence” provisions of the Australian tariff. I
know nothing of the facts myself; but it
what my friend in the trade says is true, the
Department ought to start doing something
before to-morrow morning.
“Christopher” : As a resident of Dunwieh
(Q.) for several years I’d like to suggest
some amendments to “Mag’s” remarks about
Stradbroke Island (B. 20/9/’23). The
"bottomless lake,” some distance inland, was
sounded during a Government survey of the
island a few years ago. The greatest depth
is, quoting from memory, only aoout l (l
fathoms. It discharges into a vast morass,
or floating bog, by a creek at the computed
rate of 2,000,000 gallons daily. The name
of the Lake is Karboora, or “Blue Water'
(the color reminds one of the Mediterranean,
so intense is the blue). The lake supposed
to have a tide is Bummell (phonetic), or
"Brown Lake,” whose water is the color ot
a Scotch mountain tarn —a clear brown. The
level varies according to the amount of seep-
age from the surrounding hills; hence the
"tide” myth.
"The Rumpus”: Misappropriation of high-
class hen-fruit like that mentioned by “Wil-
frido” (B. 27/9/’23) is liable to occur ashore
as well as aboardship. A Groperland fan-
cier used to be much concerned at the man-
ner in which members of the public stole
the eggs out of his birds’ pens at show-time.
One year he placed his son on watch with
a covered basket and certain instructions.
The lad started operations by taking an egg
from the basket, surreptitiously trundling it
into a pen and then moving on to give the
public a fair field. In less than five minutes
the egg had disappeared. Throughout the
dav the watcher kept himself busy introduc-
ing eggs for the hens to make a fuss about
qnd thieves to spirit away. Whenever he
chanced on the dinkum goods lie removed ir
himself. That day the public walked away
with , three dozen “Warwicks” stowed away
on its person, and liable to hurst at any
moment.

Pinero’s “Iris,” at Sydney Theatre Royal,
is the play that gave Oscar Asche one of
his first opportunities of "knocking” London
22 years ago. The world the dramatist de-
picted seems a remote one now, as out of
date as the fragmentary side-whiskers worn
by that ideal club secretary of the period
whose objective was to give members "every
opportunity to grumble and no cause.” The
scenes alternate between well-upholstered
Kensington drawfing-rooms and Italian hotels
looking out upon seductive seas. Iris Bel-
lamy is a charming widow who is to loss
all her fortune if she marries again. This
doesn’t seem to matter very much, anyhow,
seeing that a dishonest trustee-attorney bolts
with it after the first act, but it serves to
explain why Iris is at first presented as
hesitating between the pull of two suitors,
Frederick Maldonada, a huge, ogreish Portu-
guese-Jewish-South American millionaire, and
Lawrence Trenwith, a gallant and per-
sonable swain with no prospect of providing
a home for her unless he can hew it out of
British Columbia backwoods by the sweat of
his bi’ow —which on the face of it (and
him) looks improbable. Love triumphs,
however, and the moneyed ogre is off-staged,
or seems to be, for a bit. But before Law-
rence departs for his log-cabin in 8.C., after
a series of devotion-packed scenes with his
soul-mate, “Maldci” is already laying his dia-
bolical plans to get possession of Iris. Her
poverty and helplessness are his opportunity,
and presently he has her installed in an ex-
pensive London flat. But his infatuation is
so intense that he is again exerting pressure
on her to marry him when Lawrence re-
turns, after two years, learns all that has
happened from the lady’s lips, and behaves,
despite her tearful clingsomeness, much as
Angel Clare did to Tess when she admitted
her pre-nuptial lapse. Lawrence having
melted off, Maldonada re-appears choking
with rage, throws the victim of his villainy
about, and turns her out of the house, at
some obvious risk of apoplexy to himself,
smashes a number of priceless works of art,
and collapses foaming in a fit. It is about
as staggering and devastating a finale as one

has ever seen presented on the stage, albeit
there is but one actor for the curtain to fall
on.
Diana Wilson is winsome and alluring in
the opening acts. Her previous successes
have been won in much lighter and frankly
“vampish” character studies; but there is
some fine dramatic power in the way she
transforms herself into the Emelie Polini-
ish role of the last two acts. Anew McMas-
ter, as Trenwith, is not an ideal stage lover.
There is something too artificial about him,
a quality that sometimes leaves the audience
a little doubtful whether to be thrilled or
amused at his transports and impetuosities.
Oscar Asche, of course, dominates every-
thing, and by sheer physical bulk makes all
the other male actors look like pigmies. With
turned-up moustaches and a brief beard to
match, he might be a Mexican bandit run
to flesh ; although, when he appears in blue
double-breasters, as a change from sweeping
swallow-tails and frock-coats, he wakens
fleeting memories of one of W. W. Jacobs's
night-watchmen. He leaves a series of unplea-
sant impressions, from monstrous grotesque-
ness and sneering cynicism to savage inten-
sity ; he is just as thorough in smoking a
cigar or licking the flap of an envelope as
when he lets himself go in a passion of fury
and smashed bric-h-brac. The minor charac-
ters don’t cut much ice, except Annie
Hughes, who is an effectively smart and
worldly Fanny Sylvain, and Mason Wood,
the club secretary aforesaid, who helps the
drama along, as Croker Harrington, in the
elucidatory way of a Greek chorus. Arthur
Greenaway, as Archibald Kane, the lawyer
who bolts witlr the boodle, labors under the*,
disadvantage of his real character rrot being
discovered until after he has disappeared.
“Bluebeard’s Eighth Wife” is still being
bought with American dollars and her posses-
sor tamed with French mother-wit at Sydney
Cri. Nor is there any abatement noticeable
in the nightly hurricane of mirth over the
bedroom scene.
At Sydney Opera House “The O’Brien
Girl” continues to play on a good wicket;
the coveted 50 went up on the scoring-board
last night.
“A Southern Maid” opens at Her Maj-
esty’s, Sydney, on Saturday night. Every-
thing will be as real as that lavish producer,
Oscar Asche, can make it; prohibitionists
may be expected to take a mournful interest
in the announcement that a full case of wine
has to be opened nightly for the cafe scene.
Ada Reeve, back at Sydney Tivoli, is rely-
ing mostly upon her old favorites, but she
has a novice in “Wodonga” (words and
music by Jack Lumsdaine) ; and as up to
now the village hasn’t held any indignation
meeting, presumably the song is all right.
But if it isn’t, three minutes with Ada will
convince Wodonga that it is. The three Nitos
are tumblers, and their antics, besides being
clever, are occasionally humorous. Irene
Magley and Monty Wolf are just lifted out
of the mire by Montague, and Long Tack
Sam continues to infuse a little Scotch into
a pot-pourri of Celectial entertainment.
Clemence Dane’s “Bill of Divorcement”
has proved the most alive play produced by
Sydney Repertory Society. Nobody has dis-
missed it with a shrug, or relegated it to the
highbrow shelf. It deals with the divorce
law, and by projecting the action 10 years
into the future the writer has given the
House of Commons time to become so utterly
bored with the discussion of whether insan-
ity should be a ground for divorce that a
bill has been passed to say it is. A good
play, well constructed, dramatic, with dia-
logue crisp and to the moment; but not a
great play, any more than Ibsen’s plays are
great. The photographic lens will never
produce a supreme work of Art, and
Clemence Dane’s brain, judged by her Lon-
don success, is of the photographic lens
variety. Queensland girl Mary Macgregor,
as the flapper daughter whose world is so
ironically turned topsy turvy, was the out-
standing figure of the cast, and Mrs. Eustace
Ilolroyde, as the wife whose supposedly-
insane husband turns up cured on the eve of
her marriage to the Only Man, was just as
weak and shifting as the author meant her
to be. Producer Gregan McMahon and
Albert Collins were the strong supports on
the male side.
“Belinda,” an April folly in three brief
acts, by A. A. Milne, was preceded by a
serious sermonette, “The Will,” by J. M.
Barrie, at Melbourne King’s on Saturday.
“Belinda” is the slender story of a youth-
ful, middle-aged flirt who had mislaid a
hairy husband 19 years ago, and is still so
fascinating that slim young poets and elderly
statisticians vie for her wayward fancy. It
is a competition between Harold Baxter,
the ponderous litterateur, and Claud Deven-
ish, the pale young poet, that accounts
for most of the comedy. Both suitors
are made to play the April fool, with
small consideration for the eternal verities
when proceedings are in danger of slowing
up. Mr. Milne even packs Baxter away in
an umbrella cupboard with no other excuse
for a drop into the realms of farce than springs
from the hope of raising the ready laugh.
Actually, he raises no laugh out of the epi-
sode, and derives no dramatic advantage
from it, and its introduction lays him open
to the rebukes of every critic with a native
respect for the coliereucies of English com-
edy. The absent husband turns up in the
shape of a clean-shaven, presentable gentle-
man of the larger growth, and one gathers
that he has spent the intervening 19 years
hunting lions in the Rockies or grizzly-bears
in darkest Africa. The reason why he wore
a Mosaic whisker in his earlier married life
is now apparent. The lady does not recog-
nise him, and John Tremayne becomes an
ardent suitor of his own wife, in the hope
of inducing her to forget and forgive the
time when he slammed the door. The story
does not give satisfaction, and its situations
are rather strained and unreal; but Irene
Vanbrugh contrives to twist a good deal of
entertainment out of it.
Given a defective Belinda, and the whole
entertainment would go hopelessly to pieces.
Irene Vanbrugh makes the infatuation of
Baxter and Devenish for a lady just a trifle

beyond the age-limit appear almost excusable,
and handles the bright dialogue like an artist.
Her little touches of elderly coquetry are
extremely diverting, and the whole character
is happily conceived and tellingly presented.
Dot Bocicault. as the elder suitor, Harold
Baxter, sets Lloyd George to comedy, so far
as figure and facial characteristics are con-
cerned, but does not seem to have made up
his mind exactly what kind of a man Harold
is to be. The fault is perhaps Milne’s.
Pirie Rush is the stage-poet, and plays him
without particular emphasis or effect. C. M.
Hallard is just about good enough as John
Tremayne and Jennet Eccles makes a pretty,
provocative Delia.
A space of 25 years is covered by the Barrie
curtain-raiser —much too large a spread for
an ordinary one-actor; but it is split into
firstly, secondly and thirdly. beloved
brethren, and, as in most of Barrie’s plays,
there is a formidable moral adjacent,
although 10 people picked at random out of
the audience would discover as many dif-
ferent logical conclusions. Henry Latimer,
who is an elderly solicitor in “firstly,” a,nd
who begins to dodder in “thirdly,” presents
the best bit of work in “The Will.” Ethel
Wellesley is a good second as an assertive
wife.

Despite the rumblings of rumor, “The
Beggar’s Opera” opened up at Melbourne
Majesty’s on Saturday casted as in the Syd-
ney production. On the whole, it was warmly
welcomed, albeit to a section of the house
Gay’s clever travesty of the opera of 200
years agone, and his joyous satirising of the
ancient —which is also the modern —craze
for glorifying the sufficiently picturesque
criminal plainly seemed pallid—these people
had come prepared to withstand the shock
of coarse dialogue and Rabelaisian humor,
and found little to blush at beyond the in-
elegant names hurled at the ladies of the
play. But even these more or less disap-
pointed ones could not fail to find the music
bewitching. As the swashbuckling highway-
man Macheath, the hero of a hundred loves,
Howett Worster fits the situation admirably.
Having unloaded his former handicap of
stiffness, he unlooses a spontaneous humor
and vocal liquidity which is more than satis-
fying. He achieves his finest expression in
the fine old melody, “When the Heart of a
Man is Oppressed with Cares.” Pauline
Bindley’s fine voice has lost something of the
flute-like quality which distinguished it in
the days when she pantomime-girled to Yera
Pearce’s boy, but she has learned to act as
well as sing since then, and makes a charm-
ing Polly Peachum. Beryl Walkely does
good, all-round work as Polly’s friend and
enemy, Lucy Lockit; and Eily Malyon.
whose rich comedy is an amusing asset, has
developed a sweet, small singing voice which
never fails to let you know what she is sing-
ing about. Charles Hattam, Reg Roberts,
Jack Cannot and Victor Prince all get
through in good style, and not the least im-
portant item in the show is the orchestra
under Andrew McCunn, in which the play-
ers, wearing the trappings of the Peachums’
day, make music on Old World instruments,
including the harpsichord and the viol
d’amour.
V alter Kirby song recitals will be staged
in the Melb. Town Hall on the evenings of
October 25 and 30, with a matinee on the
2< th. The G.-G. has mentioned that he will
bring a party to the matinee.
The spectacle of stout John Kirby trying
to dope the favorite in "Pretty Peggy” at
Melbourne Princess’s becomes a matter of
seething interest as the Cup Carnival
approaches. Kirby performs the trick in the
full uniform of a sporty aristocrat, and gives
the impression that the stiffening ot an
animal is about as exciting as carrying round
the tea at tennis.
The simple word "Sally” in electrics on
the front of Melbourne Royal is still catch-
ing the eye of hundreds who are all dressed-
up and want somewhere to go.
The Greatest Show on Earth hit Mel-
bourne in the old place on Saturday night,
and made the usual good impression. This
time the performance has some capital fea-
tures—in the ring and over the ring: in
pink tights and in frocks, to whose designing
Mrs. Wirtli has brought her line sense for
color. There are 20 or more turns on the
programme, ranging from the time-worn
teats in the arena to the blood-curdling spec-
tacle of Evans and Perez doing everything
short of sleep while perched on the top of
a 30ft. pole. The same old jockeys prance
on the same old steeds, and the same old
wild animals roar defiance at their trainers
while earning their nightly crust. Among new
turns are the juggling of Carmelia, Alfredo's
dogs, who play musical instruments and drive
the band mad with jealousy, and the boxing-
ponies—these last look like Wirths’ trump
cards. For the rest the elephants, considerably
increased in number, regard the proceedings
with their usual aloofness, and Welbv
Cook’s team of six beautifully-trained white
gee-gees are a joy for ever.
“Kick In,” the week’s sermon at Hoyt's.
Melbourne, depicts a crook in search of the
Better Life, and Bourke-street is emptying
daily to witness the marvel. The sweet
story of a boy-and-girl passion that grows
up and respects the Ten Commandments is
capitally filmed in “Children of the Dust.”
“Temptation,” which heads the programme
at the Majestic, is showing how fast men
and slow women are changing their distin-
guishing adjectives. “The Ace of Hearts,”
a gaudy anarchist narrative at the same
house, is Deadwood Dicky in spots, but the
leading lady. Leatrice Joy, is a siren to re-
member. The main feature at the Britannia
is the fire-fighting epic, “The Third Alarm.”
Tilings are very quiet in Adelaide. The

the Royal is marking time with a variety eo.

of Wales (strong on the athletic side) and
the Majestic keep things going with more
variety : and outdoor shows for the summer
are beginning to talk business. In pictures
the York makes a direct bid for the sup-
port of the churches with a “Village Black-
smith.” not exactly “after” Longtellow—it
goes far beyond him. West’s has “One Ex-
citing Night”: and it is. The Pav. shows
New York’s underworld in "The Ghost
Patrol,” and Wondergraph makes a spirited
effort to prove that the other end of a city
can be just as bad.

The Belting that Serves You
Longest—-Serves You Best.
Inefficiency in driving qualities of a belt —loss of power through slippage
and friction—will rapidly wear out any belt. Other things being equal, the
belt which wears longest is that which does its work best. The many records
of ten, fifteen or twenty years of service of
PIONEER LEATHER BELTS
are evidence of its working efficiency no less than its wearing qualities.
Minimise your expenditure on belting repairs and renewals by specifying
Pioneer Leather Belting for every drive.
The belt illustrated is an 18in. 3-ply Pioneer Leather Belt in Messrs. James
Barnes, Ltd., Linseed Oil Mills, Alexandria, N.S.W. It has been in constant
use on’the same drive for more than twenty years, for the past five years
giving 24 hours a day service.

“Renquifliau”: If liis present intention
holds, Australia lias seen the last of Bert
Bailey, as Dad Rudd. His idea is to spend
his days on a place lie owns at Lake Mac-
quarie, witli fowls, flowers and similar props
as a background, and a real boat and prac-
ticable water in the foreground. Bert made
his first dramatic appearance umpteen years
ago at Cleveland-street (Sydney) Public
School* what time “Jerry” Taylor, late of
the Public Service Board, was a master, in
a recitation of “The Charge of the Light
Brigade.” He is well “heeled,” being a
sleeping partner in McCatliie's, of Pitt-
street, of which firm his mother was the
founder. A sister and a half-brother control
the business to-day.
“C. Ockney” : When Pinero’s “Iris,” now
at Sydney Royal, was produced at London
Garrick over 20 years ago, the cast included
Dion Boucicault as well as Oscar Asche.
Dion played Croker Harrington, and Jerrold
AN EMOTIONAL STAR.
THE STAR: “It’s marvellous in what divers
ways my acting moves the multitude.”
THE BOOR ATTENDANT: “Yes, it’s queer how
it worts on ’em —for instance, I’ve seen
as many as a dozen feelin’ for their
hats."
Robertshaw, another mummer well known
in these parts, was the defaulting solicitor.
Curious that America should have supplied
the leading lady. Fay Davis. She was also
in the first English cast of Pinero’s “Prin-
cess and the Butterfly.”
“Orb”: Mention by “Lord Quiz” (B.
18/10/’23) that Harry Sweeney is to play
Lord Illingworth in an American production
of “A Woman of No Importance” recalls that
be figured as that nobleman’s son years since
with the Plimmer-Denniston Co. Titheradge
was Lord Illingworth. Harry is a son of
.lack Sweeney, for many years George Rig-
nold’s chief funny man. On and off the stage
lie is a walking advt. for his tailor. Yet lie
doesn't put on “dog" in the slightest degree,
and when on tour with some of the smaller
•J.C.W. shows he earned a bit extra during
the day by juggling in overalls with scenery
and boxes. A good actor and a good chap.
"Hambone”: The TJ.S. fillum perdoocer
rarely misses a chance of sneaking one home
on ,T. Bull. In an atrocity called “The
Rustle of Silk ’ the leading character is a
British statesman who is fighting for the
better care of soldiers maimed in the war.
Warriors, ragged and crippled, arc shown
begging for pence, and a screen sub-title re-
fers to them, in effect, as the forgotten
saviours of Britain. Perhaps J. Bull hasn’t
done as much for his broken men as he could
have done. But there should be no taunts
coming from the country that insisted on
hacking its pound of flesh from Bull’s im-
poverished frame. “The Rustle of Silk” is
founded on a book by Cosmo Hamilton, and
there are no such sneers in the book.
“J.F.II.’s” rhapsody, in burnt cork:—
E. W. Ballantine, the last survivor of the original
( liristy Minstrels, has died at a great age in a
London suburb. Men with artificially-blackened
faces sang and danced before Christy’s time, but that
cute American was the first to organise the half-
circle of (mostly) imitation-nigger vocalists and
dancers, with bones and tambourines in the corners
and, in the centre, a dignified interlocutor. At least
a score of these minstrel groups crossed the Pacific
from America to Australia. The first was Rainer’s,
which arrived in the ’fifties. I was too young to
see that one, but I think I patronised all the others.
Weston and Hussey’s combination was the best of
the lot. Frank Weston, its interlocutor, was still
living in Adelaide when I last heard of him.
Another member was Harry Kelly, finest of minstrel
singers, dancers and comedians: his only rival was
Eugene Stratton, who came to St. James’s Hall,
London, for three weeks and remained there for 50
years. I wonder how many of the old-time minstrels
who used to delight us at St. George’s Hall and the
Apollo, Bourke-street, Melbourne, are still alive?
Harry Kelly, Frank Hussey, Charles Holly, Beaumont
Read. Horace Bent, Tom Buckley, Tom Rainford, the
Cogill Brothers, Billy Emerson, Louis Braham, Edwin
Amery, T. P. Hudson, Owen Conduit, Nicholas la
Feuillade, the Gardners, the Hugos—their names
and wheezes and snatches of the songs they sang
linger in the memory. Some of them are mentioned
in Laurence Hutton’s “History of Negro Min-
strelsy,” a book that I take down from its shelf
when I want to revive my recollections of those good
old times in Melbourne.
“Norbell”: All the gilding and- spring-
cleaning of Melbourne Princess’s (B.
18/10/’23) can’t alter the fact that it was
always the best-designed and best-appointed
theatre in Australia —thanks to architect
Pitt, and that far-sighted theatrical chief,
George Musgrove. The “new” Princess’s, the
present structure, was opened on Saturday.
Dec. 18, 18S6, by Williamson, Garner and
Musgrove. “The Mikado” was the attraction,
with Alfred Cellicr. composer of “Dorothy,”
in the conductor’s chair.
“Second Murderer”: When the million-
dollar marrow-freezer is turned on the pic-
ture screen nowanights, there is a touching
little prologue. The million-dollar leading
lady, in million-dollar furs, is observed in-
tently regarding a map of Australia. With
a super-manicured forefinger she traces the
route from San Francisco to Sydney. Then
her face is lit up with a million-dollar smile.
She raises her heavily-shaded orbs, exudes
screen personality at the audience, and slops
over in a sub-title —
Dear, dear, Australian friends! Some day I may
come to you, in person. How I long to see your dear
sunny land! I now present “The Girl Who Slid.”
In this supreme art wonder-film I have reached the
Pinnacle of. my Career 1 I know you’ll love it, for
my sake!
It is all so ingenuous, so human, so Holly-
wooden, that it makes us mushy at once.
“F.L.11.”: Baritone Percival Driver, who
was imported to Australia in 1909 to sup-
port the Cherniavsky trio, is again on a
visit —not as a singer this time. In com-
pany with Dr. W. G. Whittaker he is doing
examinations in music for the Associated
Board.
“M.W.”: The Pounds sisters (B.
18/10/’23) made their debut in a revival of
“A Midsummer Night’s Dream.” Lorna
was an eight-year-old Fairy; Toots a Cob-
web of six. That is young enough for any-
things; but Decima McLean, whose father
was ballet-master with J. C. Williamson,
tripped on the stage at the blase age of four.
“F.A.”: Harry Sweeney, now Mowbray
(B. 18/10/’23), was a versatile standby for
the Firm a decade and a half ago. Nothing
came amiss to him; comedy, comic opera,
diama and melodrama, he played them all.
When the unsuccessful “Lady Madcap” was
first presented Harry was rushed into the
part of the French count, and did well, too,
especially in the number “I Like You in
Velvet.” When the “Lady” turned up her
toes, the slim mummer was nightly shot
dead as Eddie, the stool-pigeon, in “Within
the Law.” He toured with the Tittell Brune-
Tom Kingston co. in 1907.
“Simplon”: Melbourne Herald's strong
point is its sense of proportion. Recently
it had an article in praise of Irene Van-
brush, and on the next page there was over
half a column of interview with “Squizzy”
Taylor’s friend Ida Pender. The damsel art-
lessly revealed that she was fond of swim-
ming and housework, and was on the verge
of inviting the interviewer to lunch, which
she had prepared with her own fair hands,
when he found that lie had enough “copy,"’
and would have to race back to get it into
the first edition. Miss Vanbrugh must be
intensely gratified to know that, to the
geniuses of our sensationalised press, her
news value is almost as great as that of a
crook's “tabby.”
“Anaf" : E. J. Cole, founder of the tent-
theatre which bears his name, must be about
the oldest showman in the business. At 66
he is doing “The Dripping Knife” and “Mur-
dered at Midnight” in the southern N. S.
Wales “smalls.” The old man arrived in Aus-
tralia at the age of 17, and was a surveyor’s
assistant for a time. His method of com-
bining cheap-jack sales and open-air den-
tistry with theatrical performances of the
lurid sort soon won him popularity. The
tent-shows are now carried on bv his son-
in-law.
“Ilarvib” : “Pliilm Tip's" par (B. 11/10/’26 )
about the battered pugilist who was regarded
as eminently suitable for a Bucket part in
A FORLORN HOPE.
THE ARTIST : “I'm. — er—er sorry to disturb you , but if
you should manage to dispose of them, would you.
mind sending me your customers address?”
the movies, recalls a visit I paid when in
England to Canterbury’s Cathedral. With
awed voice our guide remarked “This is
where Becket fell!” “Cripes,” exclaimed
the sport of our party—“fancy boxing here!”
“Ilamfat” : Charlie McMahon was running
a show at Dunedin, and business was rotten.
Undismayed, he announced that, as a
small return for Dunedin's overflowing hos-
pitality, he would give away a bicycle on
the last night to the holder of a ticket with
a number corresponding to one drawn from
a box. The result was a £l6O house. Ex-
penses consisted of £5 for the bike (the
agent knocked £lO off in consideration of
the ad.), £lO-odd for extra printing and
advertising, and £5 ss. for the fine and
costs—Charlie pleaded guilty. Dunedin is
Scotch, but it can be induced to take a
chance —if it thinks you have made a mis-
take in the odds.
“Second Murderer”: When I hear the
highbrows arguing as to how Allan Wilkie
/houid accent certain syllables of out-of-the
way passages in Shakspeare, I am reminded
that Barrv Sullivan once played “Richard
the Third” at Oldham (“Owdam”) in a
broad Lancashire dialect. He had been
doing the Bard for a week to rotten busi-
ness, when a local millowner advised him
to try Shakspeare on the natives in the ver-
nacular, explaining that they couldn’t under-
stand his English. Sullivan had a sense of
humor, rare in a tragedian, and did it, to
the most enthusiastic audience that had ever
been known in Oldham. It is hard to
imagine
Me lieaage, t’ Dook o’ Boockinam’s takken.
Is ’e be God ? OS wi’ ’is blanky ’eead!
But Owdam loved it.
“Flyman”: Frank Smith, mentioned (B.
27/9/’23) as a promoter of Botany handi-
caps when pedestrianism boomed in Sydney,
ran a minstrel show in the Royal Standard
(later the Little) Theatre. Walsh and
King were his topliners, but the venture
frosted in a week or so. Smith had signed
the company up for six months, and every
week he had to weigh out, with the rent-
going on all the time. It was the begin-
ning of the trot of “outs” that ended sadly
for the game old sport. Dampier came
after Smith as a lessee of the Royal Stan-
dard. Here “Robbery Under Arms” was
first staged, and in other years it was the
scene of the biggest two-up school in Aus-
tralia.
“Orb”: Mention of “Honest Hearts and
Willing Hands’ (B. 11/10/’23) reminds me
that it is 32 years since John L. Sullivan
played the heroic blacksmith —in evening
dress. The absurd drama was by Duncan
B. Harrison, who also figured in the cast, as
well as Charles and his wife
(xVlice Heorwyn),'Charles Seagrave, Emma
Bronton, Madge Seymour and Meta Pelham
(playing in Sydney the other day). It was
a bitter frost.
“Topee” dredges his memory again:—
In 1868 I sat in tjje shilling pit of the old East
London Theatre at a performance of “Azrael, or
the Prodigal Son.” Next me was a stout female
in the fish trade. With bodice unbuttoned, the
better to give egress to her feelings, she munched
a baked mackerel moistened with gin from a Day
and Martin blacking-bottle, which she hospitably
offered to share. (T 1 je three-legged porter-can, with
its rosary of pewters at 3d. a time, only came
round between the acts.) As the Prodigal lay
dreaming among the property swine, a bioramie
effect disclosed the A’hgel of Death on the horizon.
The figure expanded fill it nearly filled the back-
cloth, and the tension was such that a trodden-on
crabshell evoked “flushes” of reproof. The “hushes”
were so loud that tj)ey momentarily drowned the
incidental music, which was the creepiest imagin-
able. Suddenly from the gallery, in the maudlin,
no-pitch howl of the just-awakened drunk, came
“She Wore a Wreath of Ro-ses!” Hell broke
loose. There were fierce feminine shrieks of “Turn
’im aht!” “Throw ’im over!” Then, in a full-
throated masculine roar. “Don’t waste the blinker
—chuck ’im at the flamin’ fiddlers!”
“8.R.” : Irene Vanbrugh,
now at Melbourne King’s,
played Phoebe, in “As You
Like It,” at the Theatre
Royal, Margate, at 1(>.
Gladys Cooper began her
stage career at the same age.
but she was only Bluebell
in a provincial pantomime.
Violet was 19 when she
walked ■on in “Faust and
Loose” at Toole’s Theatre.
London ; and Marie Tempest
was two years older when
she debutted as Fiametta in
a revival of “Boccaccio.”
Sybil Thorndike, celebrated
alike in Greek tragedy and
Grand Guignol shudders, had
passed her majority on her
first appearance in a meek
comedy at Oxford. Stella
Patrick Campbell allowed 2:5
years to go by before invad-
ing the stage in “Bachelors”
at Liverpool. In the same
show was Caleb Porter, who
first appeared in Australia
as Nero with Julius Knight
in “The Sign of the Cross.”
“Orb”: Concerning “Abbot P.’s” recollec-
tion of the cast of “Robin Hood” in 1902 (R.
11/10/’23), I referred (B. 27/9/’23) to the
first Australian production, which happened
at Sydney in December, ’99. The cast then
comprised Carrie Moore, George Lauri, Hugh
Ward and Pat Bathurst, as well as Alma
Gillette as Allan-a-Dale and Charles Ken-
ningham in the title-role. “Abbot P.” is
right: George Lyding was a false-alarm
tenor.
“J.P.H.” (Lond.) finishes what he started:
I. recently remarked in The Bulletin that
“Measure for Measure” was the most unpleasant of
the Shakspearean plays, and the most difficult to
present in its entirety to a mixed audience. Others
awarded the disagreeable distinction to “Titus
Andronicus.” But authorities are now agreed that
Shakspeare had little or no hand in the writing
of “Titus” ; in that respect they bracket the grue-
some thing with “Pericles” and “Timon of Athens.”
“Titus” is about to be revived at the Old
Vie. ; “Cymbeiine,” another play rarely seen on
the boards, is booked for early production by Sybil
Thorndike. Apropos, a London Telegraph writer
recalls a representation at the Queen’s in April,
1872, “with George Rignold as a splendid Leonatus.”
It wasn’t done in London again until September,
1896, when Henry Irving presented it at the
Lyceum, with Ellen Terry as Imogen.
“Flyman”: Years ago, listening to Wie-
gand playing selections from an opera called
“La Juive,” I was astonished to hear
“Knocked ’Em in the Old Kent-road” rolled
off the Sydney Town Hall organ in Storm
Fantasia style. Was it one of Wiegand’s
gibes at liis employers, the Sydney aldermen,
of whom he was wont to say that they knew
more about sausages than Art? Or did it
belong to the opera, and was it thence
adapted or abstracted by Chevalier’s com-
poser-brother? Wiegand was certainly cap-
able of the gibe. Did he not once produce
“The Sausage Gavotte” after his pet aider-
man—in business as a butcher —had com-
plained about the programmes the city organ-
ist was submitting?
“Abbot P.”: Old George Coppin had his
troubles with gas like Melbourne citizens of
the present day. It was in 1860 that he
heaved these remarks at a Royal audience: —
Before retiring I beg to congratulate the public
on having got a second gas company. You will
scarcely believe that, after the thousands of pounds
which the gas people have received from this theatre,
they sent down to-night and threatened to cut off
the gas unless a paltry debt of £l5 was settled at
once.
Soulless things, gas companies! No feel-
ing for Art at all.
THE SINGER IN THE BATH.
[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
I’ach morn at six-thirty lie turns on th e tap
And .lifts up his bcttle-o voice
In what he calls song—though lie can't sing a scrap —
And invites all the world to rejoice
That lie’s making his morning ablutions. I hear
Throug'h the walls —they’re but plaster and lath —-
Oh, only too plainly, the boarder insanely
ilisturbing the house in the bath.
lie splashes about with a porpoise-like zeal ;
I wrap up my head in a shawl,
And under the bedclothes I dive, and I squeal
At his ante-meridian bawl;
1 squeal and I curse and I kick ’neath the sheets,
Going dippy almost in my wrath.
But though I may do so, that hash-liouse Caruso
Still shrieks his high notes in the bath.
A robber of rest and of harmony too—
Why should such a nuisance be borne?
There’s a limit, I say, and I’m the man who
Will likewise rise early one morn.
I’ll break in the door while he bleats ’neath the
shower,
And wipe the plague out of; my path;
Then I’ll go to the halter—my ;footsteps won't falter—
For 4 ro 'viiing the wretch in the bath!

HUDSON SUPER-SIX
EVERY MILESTONE PASSED
Brings Your Car Nearer to the End of its Usefulness.
Most cars run well and look well when new!
But it is only when the speedometer has registered over five figures that the
true worth of a car begins to show. It is then that previously-hidden qualities
become apparent, likewise defects if they exist.
Purchasers who judge cars from this aspect will always select a Hudson Super-
Six; for Hudson Cars have proved that the most severe usage it is possible to
inflict will only reveal their lasting qualities to their best advantage. And it
is because of this ability to stand up to abnormal conditions that experts have
called the Hudson

C.J.L.: You talk about critical reviews,

The gods put up a painter’s brain
At auction: ’twas Bill Orpen’s.
“A numskull, this,” said Jove, “’tis plain ;”
And the highest bid was —fourpence.
■ . . . G.H.S. (Solomons) : Your letter is best unprinted ,
it lias been passed to where it may do some good.
• ...G.D.A.: Really, obscurity isn’t a virtue even in
poetry... .Sapere A.: We couldn’t accommodate the
flood that it would let 1005 e.... H.D. (Condoblin) :
Send ’em a10ng.... J.B. (Stanmore) : “Snow” is weak
stuff. .. .C.M. (North Sydney): The much-advertised
person and his dog won’t do.. . . D.F.P.: The point
is too small... .Jack E.: Seems pretty mad.... The
Stranger: It is beaten by furlongs... .C.M.L.: Not
enough in it.... Pheldy: As much of it as we can
read is no g00d.... S'. B. (M.L.) : The verse is thin
and uninteresting. .. .E.J.G.: It’s impossible to use
that easy Fitzgerald stanza on such a subject without
making a parody of 0mar....H.8. (.Junee) : Sorry,
but we’ll have to send your daisies back.... Jack
W.: Doesn’t strike u5....F.F. (Bridgetown): Too
long for their small points... .T.J.8.: Treads old
and too familiar ground.... Tempe: You state the
facts but get none of the feeling. .. .R.II. (Bondi):
You won’t get past the mat while you tag out lines
with phrases like “doth bide”.... A.G.W.: “The
Phantom Maid” is a rather awkward lady....G.M.
(Edgecliff) : Not up to standard... .J.C.C.: We find
the animal pretty tedious.... T.T. (Coogee) : Weak,
limping little things that contrive to say nothing....
Bellerive: Let the moth prance
Up to the ceiling
And around and around,
Pranceth the moth
With a fluttering sound;
Whirls on the window,
Upon the table will fall,
Wildly ascends And —
Lobs on the wall:
Up to the ceiling—
And around and around
Speeds the mad moth
With a fluttering sound :
By the glare of a candle,
A lamp or gaslight,
’Twill crumple and die
In its wanton flight,
....Crumpet: There is too much talk about “finding”
a market, too little about making one. In 1912
and thereabouts the Canadian raisin crop averaged
70,000 tons; it is now 270,000 tons, and the priee
has very nearly doubled—practically all as the re-
sult of cultivating the market... .M.B. (Inverell) :
“The Warrior” wants more drill. .. .Sonate R.: Far
too thin. .. . A.T.A.: Not nearly strong enough....
Hall B.: Not much skill or point Sid P.: Suitable
for Susan’s album.... Reum M.: Topical verse must
have more snap than that. .. .A.P.R.: Not much of
a yarn there... .Sidney C.: It’s rather an insult to
a woman to write about her in verse as bad as
that.... Wincross: Anaemic and commonplace....
B. : Too much melodrama. . . .Cecil G.: It might
have been blank or some other sort of verse jf it
had been different.... Topee: No use to u 5.... Alice
.1.: Father built a fowlhouse. AA'e would have
accepted the statement without all that sombre
detail.... G.P.M.: No use... . W.G.Iv.: Hangs on too
small a nail: and what there is of it is not very
convincing... .D.T.: Nothing there... .A.J.H.: You’ve
toiled hard to get mirth, and you’ve left the sweat
marks visible Twice-Bitten: Give its loveliness to
the Spring airs:—
Here in the blank nothingity of power,
Translucent, nebulous as an empty plate,'
I gaze as wasps upon a lovely flower
That will not sting although they come too late.
I feel that it is better to be here
Than nowhere else, though fate be heathenish;
-And with my feet upon the hemisphere,
Perpetually hold my breath and wish.
It is the time when weeds are in the corn
And roots obliviate the stump-jump plow.
Neath corrugated-iron man is born;
And this is still his motto—Do it now !
.. . . B.A’.E.: Hasn’t a suggestion of truth 8.C.F.:
They don’t strike us.... Lone Pine: You have a poor
idea of verse-making Margot M.: The yarn has
■some color and a lot of loose words E.J.G.: Old
yarn in very lumpy verse C.C.M.: “The Poet”
is not up. but it has a few suggestive lines. Can you
improve it?,.. .I.E.AV.: Commonplaces in poor verse.
....Lone Hand: The yarn is conventional, and the
points are handled in the old way.... X.A.Z.
(Hobart): The “Mill” doesn’t groan well enough....
Betty O.: The verse is simple and natural. You’re
young—keep working Audrey O.: Try something
original. That is only an imitation of poor stuff. .. .
C. : You contrive to make it irritating C.K.T.:
Poor material for a yarn.... Arnold P.: That Inc-
been done far too often.... A.AALT.: Nothing there
for public consumption W.E.8.: A poor sketch,
Packeroo: Lamentable G.T.P.AV.: No good at
a11....8. Foote: Nonsensical examination paper you
quote is from “A’erdant Green at Oxford.” AW*
never heard it suggested that there was any “literary
explanation to it”... . Magela: AAell enough written;
but you don’t make us believe, that McTagart was
that sort of man. . . .Edwin AA'.: An ingenious yarn
spoiled by its overburden of dialogue. .. .B. Blithe-
some: Fair jingle; but light weight Hilda E.:
“Safety First” failed on the post, chiefly through the
obscurity of the last stanza... .Hermes: There is
hardly a statement in that United Empire article
which isn’t an absurdity. The olive has been culti-
vated in S. Aus. for 70 years, and few Australian
products are of higher quality than S.A. olive-oil,
or more widely marketed.
TO ARTISTIC (AND INARTISTIC)
CORRESPONDENTS.
AA’.M.: Decrepit old gag badly illustrated....
Cisum: All off the target... .C.A r .L.: “You sure are
some abysmal brute” —what language is that ?....

when that sort, of cargo ceased to be excep-
tional the bonus vanished—for good, appa-
rently.


To ride in a
is to know absolute car comfort
This is because the unique suspension
means that all shocks are absorbed and eliminated by
the springs.
This ensures against fatigue and undue expenditure of
nerve force.
It also guarantees increased life of the car itself, because
it prevents road shocks from being transmitted to the
machinery and body of the car.
Vickers’ world-famous steels, and the other superfine
materials used in the construction of the WULbhLh,,
further ensure immunity from the ravages of wear and
tear. The WOLSELEY is a car built for endurance. It
retains its strength and beauty year after year. It is a
permanent source of self-congratulation to the owner.

Insects
How to destroy them
Diseased, Plague-infested
insects are a positive
menace, and should be
ruthlessly destroyed by
using
Kruses
Insecticide
Insects of every species are“down
and out” the moment this mar-
vellous exterminator is applied.
Kruse’s Insecticide positively kills
Fleas, Ants, Bugs, Flies, Cock-
roaches, Mosquitoes, Moths, etc.;
yet is positively harmless in its
application to Dogs, Cats, Poultry,
etc., etc.
For tFie destruction of Aphis.
Woodlice, and other plant-attack-
ing insects, a light sprinkling of
Kruse’s Insecticide in still weather
is all that is necessary.
One tin, carefully used, lasts a
very long time.
Be careful you get the genuine Kruse’s —
It never fails.

“Hobnobster”: Rubbish prices for stock?
At a cow-cocky’s farm, just off the road rrom
Ivalbor to Mumbilla (Q.), during the present
drought, I saw three cows in full milk and
two draught-horses—rising eight—sold for
15 bob the lot.
“Sturt” : South Aus. is settling down for
the summer with every prospect of a good
wheat harvest. The September rainfall in
the southern parts was more than an inch
above any previous record ; and the average
yearly fall has been easily left behind, with
only three-quarters of the year gone.
“Lexite”: An old enemy has come back
for peaceful purposes to Australasian waters
—the steamer Antinous, which sailed from
Wellington (M.L.) for Noumea the other
day. The vessel is the sometime German
raider Wolf, which fluttered the hearts of
many mercantile skippers in the Pacific
during the early days of the war.
“2641” : North Queensland sugar-mills have
been running to some tune recently. Goondi
(C.S.R.), in the Johnstone River district,
put up a record by crushing 5824 tons of cane
m one week. Past month lnkerman mm,
Lower Burdekin, beat this by passing 5885
tons through its rollers. The record for a
season is 149,000 tons, which stands to the
credit of Babinda mill, Cairns district.
“Q’Giddout” : Re “Carisbrook Jun.’s” two-
faced half-crown (B. 6/9/’23). “Jaclty Roo”
has an impression that even in George lll.’s
reign the date was stamped on the tail side
of a coin. I don’t want to fall out, or fall
anywhere, for that matter, with “J.R.,” but
please warn him not to gamble on his im-
pression. I have a well-preserved deener of
the third Geordie stamped “1817” under the
noyal neck.
“Winconsin”: I know of a Queensland
farmer who bought 25 acres of prickly-pear
land at 3s. 9d. an acre. A contractor poisoned
the pear for £3 per acre. When it was com-
pletely dead the owner put a tire through it,
thus evenly distributing the potash contained
in the pear—one of the best fertilisers known.
In due course he planted with cotton; the
patch gave him a return of £l5 per acre,
while cotton sown on clean, unfertilised land
s*iccumbed to the drought.
“Uramao”: Few of the brain-waves that
sweep through Government departments are
as worthy of mention as one that has just
hit the Maoriland Meat Producers’ Board.
The Board intimates that anyone sending
along £1 13s. with the address of a friend
in the motherland can without more ado
rely on the Board delivering at that friend’s
address in any part of the United Kingdom
a carcase of frozen mutton. The advertising
possibilities of this scheme in broadcasting
Massey’s mutton need no elaborating.
“F. Clinton”: The modern method of plac-
ing pyramids of short sticks on mud flats for
the cultivation of oysters in the rivers along
the coast of N.S.W. has added tremendously
to the value of oyster leases. The sticks are
about 2ft. long, and need not be more than
about 2in. thick. They cost something like
£2 a thousand, and return the oyster lessee
as much as eighteenpence per stick. The
black mangrove is the favorite timber. White
mangrove is absolutely useless; oysters never
attach themselves to it.
“Haka” : Although Maoriland grows hides
and ships them to J. Bull, boot manufac-
turers in the Dominion have been up against
trouble when competing with the imported
English boot of the heavyweight type. One
manufacturer, who has been feeling the pinch
rather badly, got an imported English water-
tight boot and held an inquest on it. The
middle sole, instead of being in one piece,
had a waste of worthless material in the
hollow under-part. The heels were packed
up inside with shoddy. The upper was skil-
fully finished, but the front portion, instead
of kip, was split leather. In another boot
the heel consisted of 10 pieces.
“Ringer”: Re the chances of successful
date-growing in Australia (B. 26/7/’23).
the climate and the soil ought to be suit-
able enough in the central parts of the
continent, but the absence of water at a
shallow depth is the drawback. In the Sinai
and Mesopotamia deserts, where the date-
palm flourishes, water can be obtained in
about 15ft., and this seems to be essential
to their successful cultivation. I’ve seen
dates growing at Lake Harry, near Hergott
Springs _ (S.A. ) ; but they didn’t touch the
Asia Minor standard.
* * * *
“C. Clinton” : Thanks no doubt to the un-
£? r J a^ ty r^ produced by the prohibitionists, the
N.S.W. Department of Agriculture is finding
the demand for phylloxera-resistant stocks
for grape-vines falling off so much that there
is little to warrant the continuance of the
Howlong Nursery. It is a bit of luck that
an offer has been received from the Phyl-
oxera Protection Society of South Aus. 'to
lease the nursery, and as about £2OOO p.a.
is being lost on the place the offer has come
in the nick of time. South Aus. has been
singularly free from phylloxera, but is tak-
ing no chances.
* * * *
Sturt”: Adelaide is planning several im-
provements. About half the width of North-
terrace was given up years ago to rockery
and lawn, leaving only 68ft. from kerb to
kerb. About lift, of lawn is now to be
resumed for road. Pritchard. Mayor of New-
town (N.S.W.), lately in Adelaide for an
A.N.A. conference, has been chaffing resi-
dents about the iron fence, ornamental but
absurdly substantial, which runs round all
tour quarters of the central Victoria-square.
These palisades were put up 40 years ago
to replace the 1 original post-and-rails, in
days when sheep and cattle were driven
through the streets. Nowadays they are an
anachronism. Meanwhile, the Tramways
Trust erects a barn at the south-eastern
corner of the square, so that cars won’t have
to run out to the “depot” when not in use •
and it proposes to push Currie-street out
through the park lands, giving a new ap-
proach to the city from the ivest.

“Trevdee”: A typiste brought this refer-
ence when after a job the other day :
To Whom It May Concern, —I have known the
bearer of this note for 10 minutes; she is a sport.
—(Signed) J. Soandso.
She got the job, too!
“Tha Deacon” : There would be fewer close
shaves of the sort mentioned by “George
Rich” (B. 27/9/’23) if the railway peopV
here insisted, as they do in other countries,
that all shunters and those working near
railway-points wore elastic-side boots instead
of lace-ups.
“Seembee”: Pars, about Australian resi-
dents of a generation ago or less who had
seen Napoleon at St. Helena remind me
that living at Indooroopilly (Q.) 27 years
ago was an old man named Stamm, whose
boast was that as a child he had been dandled
by Napoleon during the retreat from Moscow.
Joe Westhoven, the new Federal public-
service inspector, who is specialising on
finance and accountancy, was for a few years
chief accountant of the Vic. sect'on of the
Postal Department, and then had about a
year of the same kind of job in the Ma State.
He is not the type of man that settles down
to wait for somebody to die or retire, and
he has a good way to go yet, being not
even middle-aged.
N. S. Wales is losing one of the men
prominent in the A.L.P. ballot-box scandal —
W. H. Hutchison, see. of the Ryde League.
He had four attempts to win a Parliamentary
gold pass, twice at Parramatta for the Re-
presentatives, and twice at Ryde for the State
Assembly. A man of extreme views, he was
particularly hurt when he was threatened
with some of the expulsion medicine he had
strongly advocated for others; and now he
is returning to Scotland —the country whence
he came.
“Herodot” : For peculiar accidents I enter
the following, which just stopped short of
being fatal. A motor-cyclist was riding down
Tarcutta Hill (N.S.W.), when one end of a
silk scarf around his neck became entangled
in the mechanism of the bike. The scarf
started to wind up rapidly, dragging the
wearer’s head with it; he jerked himself free
only when his face was a few inches away
from the engine and himself half-choked by
the pressure on his neck.
Calvin Coolidge, the present U.S. Presi-
dent, is the first occupant of the White
House from Massachusetts for nearly a cen-
tury, and the only one from there except the
tw r o Adamses —John (1797-1801) and John
Quincy (1825-1829). America’s 30 Presi
dents have been supplied by 11 States; five-
sixths of them by six States. The list reads
Ohio (6), New York (6), Virginia (5),
Tennessee (3), Massachusetts (3), Illino's
(2), Louisiana, New Hampshire, Pennsyl-
vania, Indiana and New Jersey one apiece.
Virginia, of course, which furnished four of
thg first five Presidents, had her innings
early. No Southerner has run Uncle Sam’s
country since Zachary Taylor, of Louisiana,
(1849-50).
“Mendelian”: The brewing industry
serves as a pattern for the tobacco industry.
Australia, having had to give up foreign ales,
stouts and lagers, makes practically every-
thing it wants in that line. As a result,
though the number of breweries fell from 90
to 68 in 1915-20, the wages increased in the
same period from £548,632 to £831,779. As
we use 121 b. of imported leaf for every one
of local, it looks as though leaf-production
sufficient to meet our own needs would mean
a 1200 per cent, increase in the number en-
gaged in tobacco-growing. It would mean
24,000 acres instead of the paltry 2000 acres
now cropped. What war conditions compelled
us to do in regard to beers ought to be accom-
plished with greater ease in times of peace
in regard to tobacco.
“Sucre”: “T. 0.1.” (B. 4/10/’23) writes
of N.Q. pioneer J. M. Black as John Med-
win Black. John Melton Black is what the
parson named him, and Melton Hill, Towns-
ville, bears his second name to-day, while
the Black River carries his surname to sea.
Towns, whose name is preserved in the
Northern capital, was only once there —-
when the Criterion Hotel was opened in
1866. Castleton was the name first given
to the new settlement by Andrew Ball, who
with Mark Reid, brother of the more cel-
ebrated Georgie, stumbled upon Ross Creek
or River in 1864. But Black was the man
who made Townsville. He was in turn
miner, theatre-proprietor, stockrider, editor,
storekeeper and surveyor, and. above all, the
champion coloniser of North Queensland. He
died in London in 1884.
“Michael McPhairson”: I can endorse
“Ex-R.N.V.R.” (B. 30/8/’23) about the use
of wireless for direction-finding. I had ex-
perience in the Fleet during the war, and
unhesitatingly assert that the cessation of
Zeppelin raids on England was in most part
due to d.-f. wireless. The position and course
of the invading aircraft being found, it was
comparatively easy to concentrate aircraft
at the point.of attack. A link of wireless-
stations round Australia is an urgent neces-
sity, if only from a purely defence point of
view, and it would cost less than the con-
struction of a single light cruiser. Nor would
the upkeep be at all expensive. Possibly,
however, our legislators would prefer coast-
guards like those who formed a cordon round
British coasts in Napoleonic times. They
would have votes.
“Head-Collarer”: Do the truant or health
inspectors ever give the pony-training estab-
lishments a look-over, or is there any super-
vision by the Department of Labor over the
conditions of the jockey’s and “mucker-
out’s” employment in the matter of
hours, wages, board and lodging, etc.? The
fact that both the A..T.C. and A.R.C. run
funds for distressed and injured jockeys sug-
gests that the “leather flappers” do not come
under the Workmen’s Compensation Act.
And what relief does the game provide for
the sick or injured “mucker-out,” alias
stableboy? Decent trainers, I know, provide
good bed-and-board for their lads, and exer-
cise some supervision over their schooling
and morals. The A.J.C. also has a rigid
apprenticeship system for would-be jocks.,
and keeps an eye on the conduct of the gradu-
ates. The shark trainer, however, is prone
to work mere children early and late, to feed
them anyhow, and to nut them to sleep in
harness-rooms, spare loose-boxes, feedsheds
or lofts, and lei: their schooling derive from
the corner-kerbstone.

There is no better treatment than to get
a tin of Rexona and apply this antiseptic
healer night and morning. First wash the
parts affected with warm water and
Rexona Medicated Soap, and then apply
a little Rexona, binding with a soft cloth
when possible.
Rexona is a specially-prepared pro-

1902-The "Greys”
Carry Lances
In the early days of regi-
mental history the front
rank of “GREYS" in
addition to swords, car-
ried lances. Although
the sword is the weapon
popularly associated
with this famous regi-
ment, there was a time
when firelock, dirk and
pistols also formed part
of their offensive equip-
ment.
WfITH "GREYS” you get the real Virginia tobacco
flavour, because the good Virginia is not only
there—it is there in the highest degree of quality.
That is why "GREYS” holds the highest degree of
popularity and satisfaction.

The Three Hawks.
[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
f INHERE was not even the lift of a cloud,
I White shouldered, out of the sea
When I saw from an island in the east
Three, hawks fly warily ;
Out of the lap of dawn they came,
Out of the pearl and rose and flame.
\pples of gold on a silver branch,
Apples of gold for me
Xigh as great as the wistful moon,
And the pouncing hawks were three.
Three maidens watched as they wheeled
above
Fruit of honey—that looked like love.
We were the Sorcerer’s daughters set
In the orchard by the sea ;
And our bodies were fair as lilies are
And we watched the apple-tree.
One was robed in the spider’s silk
And one in a velvet white as milk.
But I, the youngest, was clad in green,
Apple-green with a girdle red;
And I laid my cheek to the russet bark
When a wing swung overhead —
Over the blue now high, now low,
The way the hopes of a lover g 0....
Were they sons of Tuirenn, or only birds?
How bright were the eyes of one! I know
When his pinion shadowed my burning cheek
’Twas tae flame of his glance that made
it glow;
There was not even a cloud in the sky,
And hawks in the sunshine soar so high !
They dropped to the branches’ silver sheen
(The archer missed when he twanged the
bow!) ;
And they carried three apples like yellow
moons
Into a land that no men know.
Then we donned our feathers of osprey grey
And followed them in the pathless way.
Followed them —I and my sisters twain —
Down to the sands and the curling foam ;
And they were to me as the sons of kings,
Tet swift as birds that are making home—
My sisters flew as avengers fly,
And I like a leaf lost in the sky !
A boat put out to the deep blue sea—
Little brown boat of the finest bark.
There were no hawks in the empty air,
The light grew dim and the hills grew
dark....
Three white swans rocked where the waves
ran free:
They dived and then there was only sea.
I saw three men in a coracle —
Sons of women they must have been!
We had shed our cloaks of feather and wing
And I was sheathed in my gown of green;
But somewhere there, as our magics crost,
My little girdle of red was lost!
There are empty twigs on the apple-tree,
My sisters’ dry eyes blaze like fire;
And I lie down in the grass to weep
For a hawk’s strong wing in my long
desire.. . .
And did I see on a swan’s white head,
A girdle-wreathed like a crown of red?
Hawk—or swan—or son of a king?
Do you lace your fingers in beads of red?
Do you woo a princess of gold and snow
And lead her home to your board and bed?
Do you kiss her into a honeyed sleep
While I lie alone in the grass and weep?
Moths come out of the velvet night,
Brush the bark of my apple-tree ;
Three twigs bleed in a thread of sap
That trickles down in the dark to me.
My ghwn hangs loose to my widowed touch —
That a little girdle should mean so much !
There was not even the lift of a cloud,
White shouldered, out of the sea
When I saw from an island floating east
Three hawks that came to me —
Out of the pearl., and rose and flame
To the open door of my heart they came.
QUEENSLAND.
M. FORREST.
Her Gentleman Friend.
[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
IE drinks fierce,” said Chiller. “It
takes an ocean of liquor to cover a
world of trouble.”
The door of the squalid bar-parlor swung
on the exit of a woman who carried a cracked
jug of that same amber liquor which filled
our mugs, and Chiller’s voice was sympa-
thetic.
“Well, it ain’t so much trouble,” corrected
Chiller; “it’s reformation, which sometimes
’urts a great deal more. I can remember the
time when Kitty was a light-’earted tart to
oom one man was as good as another, or
even better, if ’e ’ad more money and knoo
°w to spend it. An’ then down to Billycan-
street comes to live a bloke oo’s got a sorter
a stamp on ’im. Shabby an’ all that, but
kinder distinguished. ’E’d borrer a deener
offer you in a way that made yer feel you
was bein’ given an illoominated address.
“Not that ’e often borrowed money—only
now and again, when ’e was very boozed.
An’ it was then that ’e became most clarsy-
lookin’, an’ the only time ’e was really talka-
tive. ’E’d turn into this ole pub an’ talk
erbout po’try an’ the stage an’ the lor, an’
off’andedly speak of blokes you sometimes read
erbout in the papers, callin”em Bill So-and-So
an’ .Tim Some-other-Bloke. It was interestin’
to ’ear ’im, ’specially when ’e used bits er
foreign lingo. We ’ad the sorter feelin’ that
the culcher of the bloomin’ neighbor’ood was
goin’ up, an’ we was movin’ in ’igh serciety;
an’ all the tarts erbout useter sneak in an’
get near ’im, an’ maybe arsk ’im a question.
There useter be bonser nights when ’e’d talk
ter th’ ’ole mob, quite affable, erbout all
sorts of things.
“We come ter know in time that ’e ’ad
been a lawyer. There were two things ’e
’ad a big derry on, an’ useter curse whenever
e mentioned them—an’ they was the Law
Institoot an’ winimin. We learnt more about
that one night when Long May arsks ’im if
e s a woman- ater, an’ ’e says, l I ’ate wim-
men—good wimmen, at least.’
“‘You ain’t been married, mister?’ arsks
Long May. .
“ *1 am married,’ ’e says with a sorter
laugh. 'An’ me wife’s a good woman —too
good to live with.’ _ r ,
“ ’E ’adn’t been livin’ long at Mother
Byrne’s before ’e gotter be known as ‘Kitty s
Gentleman Friend.’ Kitty useter live at
Mother Byrne’s. An’ she was kinder proud
of livin’ in the same ’ouse as im ; an useter
skite about ’ow ’e’d sometimes stop when
passin’ an’ ’ave a word with ’er, an ow
perlite in ’is manners ’e was, and ow is
candle was burnin’ all night in ’is room, on
nights ’ e ’ad come ’ome sober, while e sat
writing. So it was only nateral we should
call ’im ‘Kitty’s Gentleman Friend’ —especi-
ally as we didn’t know any other name
for ’im. , ~
“Neither did Mother Byrne—’er troubles
about a bloke’s name as long as ’e parted
up ’is ddugh. But this bloke didn’t, althougn
it was only a dollar a week. Mrs. Byrne
let it out that there was two weeks owing,
and she was goin’ to out ’im. gentleman or
no gentleman, and Kitty paid, askin’ ’er to
say nothing.
“ ‘She’s shook on ’im,’ says Mother Byrne.
‘She’s got in the way of takin’ ’im things
to eat up to ’is room ; an’ yet ’e don t take
no more notice of ’er than to thank er
polite. A lot of use ’e is to ’er, anyway—
'im without a penny to bless ’imself with,
gentleman or no gentleman.
“ ‘She brings ’ome flowers, too, and puts
some in ’is room. Says she gets them sent
from the country.’
“But what’s more surprisin’ than that is
that Kitty goes an’ gets a job. She useter
be ’ome at night; and when ’er gentleman
friend came ’ome she’d always be cookin’
somethin’ an’ arsk ’im to ’ave some, saying
there was too much for ’er. TJie tarts about
got to know it, an’ useter chiak ’er, askin
’er why, if she wanted ’im, she didn’t tell
’im so. But Kitty ’ad a tongue on ’er, an’
they soon dropped that.
“One day Kitty comes up to the pub with
’er face full of - trouble, an’ arsks if ’er
gentleman friend ’ad been seen. ’E ’adn’t
been ’ome all night. Then someone blows in
with ther noos that ’e’d seen ’im at ther
Children’s Court. In fer wife-starvin’, e
reckoned ’e was. An’ Mother Byrne says
that it serves ’im right if ’e’s a wife-starver,
gentleman or no gentleman.
“But er few days later ’e turns up again,
an’ spins a yarn to Mother Byrne erbout
’aving been away in the country fer a few
days on business. After that ’e sets out on
a steady round uv boozin’, day after day,
cornin’ ’ome too late even for ther pub ere,
an’ failin’ up the stairs one step backward
fer every two forward. An’ next day there
blows into ther place a woman, all silk an’
’mightiness, ’oo arsks fer ’im.
“I ’ad stopped to yarn with. Mother Byrne,
an’, with their voices cornin’ down ther
stairs, we c’d ’ear most of what they said.
“ ‘What are you doin’ ’ere?’ says ’is voice
sudden an’ angry, an’ nearly sober, as if
the sight of ’er ’ad squared ’im up.
“ ‘What are you doin’ ’ere?’ says ’er voice,
all ’ot-ice, if you get me meanin’. ‘A nice
sorter place to live in! . .’Oo paid ther main-
tenance money for you?’
“‘Oo?’ Blime, ’is voice was full of sur-
prise. ‘Why, didn’t you? I thought as ’ow
you muster wiped it out. It’s a pretty rotten
thing fer a woman ter send ’er ’usband ter
gaol. I thought that even you would think
better of it.’
“‘l7’ She ’ad a kinder ’ard, sarcastic
laugh in ’er voice. 7 think it the best place
for you. It might remind yer of yer rerspon-
serbilities.’
“‘No it wouldn’t be you!’ ’e says. ‘Yet
it is you ’oo ’ave done me ’arm —not I you!
It was your extravergance that led ter me
smash; an’ it was you that refused ter
stand by me at a time when a man most
wants ’is wife ter stick to ’im. I mighter
fought through, but you (you ’oo was not
too damn good to spend money I told you
I couldn’t afford) —you was too virtoous to
live with a man ’oo ’ad crashed until ’e ’ad
rejustified’isself! Pah !’’e says. ‘Pah! Ter
wipe out that debt was ’ardly wliat you
would do!’
“There was er lot more from ’im about
’er not wantin’ the dough on account of ’er
rich father, an’ from ’er erbout wantin’, to
make a man of ’im again, an’ forcin’ ’im
ter face is rersponserbilities. ‘A man like
you doin’ odd jobs fer other serliciters!’ she
says. ‘Deliverin’ writs fer them !’ says she ;
an’ 'er voice all the time full of an ’aughty
scorn. Finally, she goes without noticing
nobody any more than if we was dirt. After
that there was nothin’ but the sound of ’im
mutterin’ curses, an’ of Kitty sobbin’ in ’er
room.
“Next day ’e was gone early; an’ ’e
came back more boozed than usual —-all shaky
with it, an’ with a bottle stickin’ outer ’is
pocket. Kitty went in to ’im. She ’elped
’im on to ’is bed —’e ’ad thrown ’imself down
so ’e was nearly failin’ off—an’ she put ’is
’ead on the piller. Then she got ’im a cup
of tea.
“ 'Don’t want it,’ ’e says. ‘Get out of
this, an’ leave me alone.’
“ ‘Oh, mister,’ says she, ‘why do you
wanter go on boozin’ yerself ter death be-
cause yer missus ’as treated yer rotten?
There’s alius people in tli’ world ready to
care fer a man, an’ the rest don’t matter.’
“‘What d’yer mean?’ ’e says. ‘lt ain’t
no concern of yours noways.’
“ ‘I want yer ter give up killin’ yerself
with booze. What’s the use uv doin’ that?’
“Mrs. Byrne whispered all that ter me
as we stood at the foot of the stairs. She
’ad seen an’ ’eard it; an’ when I went up
to ’er place, feelin’ kinder interested, I s-
’er standin’ there, listenin’, an’ joined ’er.
’E was ravin’ about ’is wife ’e’d done in
is position for, an’ ’ow she didn’t care.
“ ‘But I care,’ cries Kitty. ‘I love yer,
mister! I love yer’. (It sounded as if she
’ad flopped on ’er knees.) ‘I might be no
account, but I’ve lived straight for munce
because I love yer ; an’ there won’t be any

I ’ave done things fer yer. It was me that

“ ‘You!’ It sounded as if ’e ’ad sat up
flabbergasted. ‘You did this —fer me?’
“ ‘l’d do anything fer yer,’ she says in
a voice full of sobs. ‘Even if it was sendin’
yer away where ye’d never see me; I’d like

Please send me Pipe No
girl: but I’ll ’ave to earn the money to pay
you back.’
“ ‘I don’t want no paying back,’ she begins.
“ ‘Look,’ ’e says. ‘l’ve bin offered a persi-
tion. But I must live on the spot—ter be
under observation,’ ’e adds bitterly.
“ ‘An’ —yer goin’?’
’Opeless!’ ’e says in a voice that seemed
despairing again. ‘l’d need decent clothes—
an’ I ’aven’t any.’
“There was a long bit of silence.
“ ‘Money can buy them,’ she says. ‘Will
yer let me—lend it?’ says she. ‘I can get
■ some money—l 'ave some money. I can
git it in the mornin’.’
“Well, at first ’e wouldn’t; an’ then when
she pressed ’im, ’e talked about payin’ it with
interest; an’ then she was pleadin’ with ’im
to take it, but n’ot ask ’er to take interest,
but would ’e come an’ see -’er sometimes?
An’ then me and Mrs. Byrne moved away,
for we ’eard ’er tellin’ ’im ’e’d best ’ave a
sleep. An’ shortly she come out bringin’
that bottle of whisky with ’er.
“Next day Kitty’s gentleman friend came
back in a good suit o’ clobber, an’ lookin’
altergether up ter dick.
“Sev’ral times in the next few weeks ’e
come back arskin’ fer Kitty; but it always
’appened that she was out when ’e came.
“An’ then ’e came back boozed an’ gone
to the pack—fer good. ’E arsked fer ’is ole
room, an’ got it; an’ then ’e arsked fer Kitty.
An’ seeing as ’ow ’e’d ’ave ter be told, Mother
Byrne told ’im. Kitty ’ad been lumbered
two days after ’e ’ad gone, fer stealin’ a
bloke’s wallet of notes.
“ ’Er gentleman friend laid ’iinself out fer
the booze then ; in fact, ’e let it kill ’im. ’E
died sudden ; an’ when ’is people ’eard of it
through the Johns they sent fer ’is body.
They was takin’ it out the day Kitty come
back.
“It was a big funeral; but the person ’oo
cried the most at it was too frightened ter
do anythin’ but stand across the other side
nv the road and watch it pass.
“A man needs more beer when ’e thinks
of it,” concluded Chiller. “Fore ole Kitty-
kept ’er promise; an’ there’s been no other
man. But she drinks fierce.”
HAMER.
Ins an’ Outs.
[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
(i I 1 rELL, 'ow’s the game?” asked Phil
V V the Showman genially, when he
turned up again in Sydney unex-
pectedly, after one of his periodical disap-
pearances.
“Any adventures this time?” I inquired.
“Adventures?” he grinned, “/ never ’ave
no adventures. Jus’ the ornery ups an’
downs, an’ ins an’ outs. Mos’ly outs. But
look ’ere, wot’s the strong of this ’ere
noo darncin’ lurk, w’ere barefooted shielas go
pig-rootin’ about in the parks with nothin’
on ’em but a shimmy, an’ gets their photers
took in the Sunday kites like a lot of native-
companions—arithmetic, or somethin’, they
calls it?”
“Eurhythmic,” I suggested.
“Well, Shan the Goat’s got a great ideal-
that arithmetic darnces ’ll make a big punch
out back, but I don’t believe the bush Johns’d
stand it. If Shan takes it on they’d
lumber ’is tarts quicker’n ’ell’d scorch a
feather. Blime, they’d ’arf-inch Oscar
A sc.he’s mob in the mulga. W’y, w’en Pipe-
clay Wallace ’ad the petrified woman show-
in’ out in the mallee, they made ’im put kilts
on ’er —dinkum !—an’ she was made outer
marble. Any’ovv, that’s wot’s brought Shan
to Sydney, an’ I come with ’im. I been a
bit crook.
“You reckerlect I was readyin’ up that
swine of a shim-pansy for the road w’en
you see me last? Romeo was ’is moniker,
the cow! Blime, a man oughter get boobed
for ’avin’ ’im on ’is mind. I done the
Riverina with ’im, an’ then we towered Vic.
I was up in the Wimmera, a belly-achin’,
cocky’s-joy districk, full of Johns ah’ Noah’s-
arks. A man can’t get a open go there.
I’m up Dimboola way, an’ stayin’ at Dolan’s
Fambly Hotel, a proper Jack’s-come-’ome if
ever there was one. Ole Mick Dolan ’e
stan’s at the ’ead of the table at dinner-time
in ’is pants an’ dirty flannen, an’ brushes
away the flies an’ ses, ‘Will yous ’ave soup
or meat?’ An’ yet they cocks their noses up
at monkeys ! Romeo couldn’t come at Dolan’s
scran at any price. I ’ad to buy cases of
apples an’ bananas, an’ stoke ’im up with
currant cake an’ things like that.
“I didn’t mind persolving for ’is tucker,
but Romeo’s that mischeevious ’e near put
me off me pannikin. ’IS got me snouted
everyw’eres we went. The first day, at the
Dolan plotch, ’e pinches a coupler young
ducklings outer the pub poultry-run, an’
climbs the ’igh tank at the railway to give
’em a swim ! I kep’ him chained in the
stable after that, but ’e got out at daylight
one Sunday. It w r as orful ’ot weather, ’ot
as the ’obs, an’ ole Mother Dolan’s sleepin’ out
on the back verandah, an’ ’ad ’er noo ’at
laid out beside the bed all ready for early
mass. Mother Dolan reckoned that there
tit-for-tat was the lates’ fashion in Collins-
street lids. ’Er sister up at Warracknabeal
sent it to ’er for the races. It looked like
a red-an’-yeller tea-cosy stuck full of green
feather-dusters, an’ ’ad a bunch of red cher-
ries on it as big as _’en eggs. Well, she ’ad
it on a chair, with ribbons ’angin’ down, w’en
Romeo comes ’oppin’ along the verandah,
very quiet, ’oldin’ up ’is chain in one ’and
like a tart with a long train on, an’ ’e
thinks it’s jus’ the thing. ’E garropoles it
an puts it on, an’ ’e’s sittin’ quite ’appy on
the footrail of the bed, lookin’ like a C’rismas-
tree, an’ sayin’ ’is prayers. But ’is chain
give a rattle, an’ the ole cheese woke up.
She was as game as a meat-ant. mind yer,
an’ made a spring for Romeo, but she "’ad
Buck’s of coppin’ ’im, an’ ’c went for the
lick of ’is life down the main street, with
Mother Dolan’s Guy Fox lid on. An’ the ole
girl’s after ’im, with nothin’ on ’er but a
cotton singlet an’ the axe. All the people
was goin’ to first mass, an’ they be’aved like
they was ’avin’ a bad dream.
“An’ then Romeo shinned up a telegrapht-
pole jus’ outside the post-office, an’ sat
amongst the crockery incubators on top, an’
begun to eat the cherries off Mother Dolan’s
’at. The ole girl was ’angin’ on to the
fence an’ sobbin’, an’ Mick Dolan ’e wraps
a buggy-rug roun’ ’er, an’ lumbers ’er ’ome.
An’ the aargint was standin’ on the footpath
keepin’ back the mob, an’ tryin’ to temp’
Komeo down with a ’andful of grass. But
Romeo spat a mouthful of chewed cherries
an’ glass beads at ’im, an’ that put the lid
on. The sargint went stone-mad, an’ sent
to the station for ’is carbine. But I kidded
Romeo down at the death-knock, jus’ in
time to save the pore cow’s life.
“Nex’ day Dolan gets a summons out, an’
I ’ad to make a break an’ go inter smoke
down the line. I couldn’t ha’ got outer the
town on’y f’r the priest givin’ me a smother.
’E’d see the ’ole circus, an’ got cross-kiddin’
to me about it, an’ w’en I told ’im the monk’s
name was Romeo ’e yelled. It fair broke
’im up. ‘Oh, me hoy,’ ’e ses, ‘never in me
life will I see another performance of Romeo
an’ Julia to match it!’ ’e says.
“I swapped Romeo to Brocky Joe at
Murtoa for a bore-constructor as long as
Pyrmont Bridge, wot lives on live rabbits.
Pussyfoot, Brocky Joe called ’im, an’ ’e give
me ’im an’ a spinnaker to boot for Romeo,
an’ I don’t mind tollin' you ’e’s ’earty wel-
come to ’im. Pussyfoot was orright, but as
dopey as a sick Chow. Couldn’t get a wriggle
outer ’im, an’ all the mugs reckoned ’e was
stuffed. But ’e w r asn’t. ’E did a get, an’
squeezed ’isself out one night—in Ararat, it
was—an’ swallered 12-foot of the fire-’ose
outer jealousy. I couldn’t get ’im to leggo
the ’ose, an’ I was in a query wot to do, till
flash Andy ’as a brain-wave an’ turned on
the water. That was the over-tlie-Jordan
dead-finish of pore ole Pussyfoot. ’E swelled
up like ’e was poisoned' Of course, the pore
cow threw a seven, an’ Flash Andy ’ad the
gall to say ’e died of drink! Pore ole Pussy -
foot! Travellin’ animals, from camels to
performin’ fleas, is a’ anxious,- ’eart-breakin’
game.
“After that I went spruikin’ for a tent-
show. Coogan and West’s Dramatic Com-
pany they was called, an’ they was the
strongest joint I ever bumped, an’ a bigger
slug than a charity choc’late-w’eel. ‘Rob-
bery Under Arms’ was wot they acted, an’
everyone reckoned the name was no schlenter
neither. The aujence useter go sour a
treat, an’ roar me up for takin’ ’em down,
an’ me on’y rammin’. One ole pot, with
vermicelli whiskers, like Romeo’s, come out
one night an’ towels me up. ’E reckons ’e’s
been scaled. ‘I never been in favor of execu-
tin’ criminals,’ ’e ses, ‘but I changed me
mind to-night,’ ’e ses.
“Mind yer, the show was a big turnout,
with six tent-’ands, besides the company.
Talk about bushrangers—they was the ’ottest
push I ever see. They useter keep nit roun'
the side-walls of the tent w’en the show was
on to see no one ducked under, but there
was more got in that way than through the
front with dinkum briefs. Them tent-’ands
was roughies orright, an’ they’d pass in any
tug ’oo dooked -’em a zack. They was on a
bonzer wicket. Ole Coogan useter play
Starlight w’en ’e wasn’t too soused, but
mostly ’e wos sozzled to the ears, an’ didn't
seem to jerry ’ow ’e was bein’ rooked. I
’eard ’im rousin’ on one bloke ’oo ’e’d put
on the barrier between the front an’ back
seats. ‘W’y can’t yer wear a decent pair
of roun’-me’s ?’ ’e ses; ‘yer a disgrace to the
show,’ he ses. An’ the bloke chips back,
‘ ’Ow the ’ell can I buy noo pants,’ ’e ses,
‘w’en you’ve took me off the side-walls an’
put me ’ere? A bloke can’t make beer-
money ’ere,’ ’e ses. Ole Coogan cracked
’ardy. but it muster ’urt.
“I slung the bushrangin’ game at Won-
thaggi. Them coal-miners made it a welter.
They was a bit too willin’. They cot the
comic bloke one night after the show, an’
chatted ’im they’d seen a better comic than
’im shot for false pretences, an’ they dumped
’im in the carbide-pit, an’ a mob of Scotch
Pommy miners after ’im acrost a paddick.
’E did a mile under evens, runnin’ in the
moonlight like a w’ite-washed emu.
“A rum thing ’appened w’en I was goin’
down to Melbourne in the rattler the after-
noon I lef’ Wonthaggi. A miner’s missus
was in the carriage with me, an’ she ’ad a
bonzer baby about six munce old. This ’ere
woman knoo me from sightin’ me w’en I’m
spruikin’ for ole Coogan. W’en we gets to
Nyora, about 0 o’clock, there’s thirteen minits
for refreshments, so I ’ops out for to ’ave
a cup of tea. I brings back a cup for the
woman, an’ she arsks me if I’ll mind the kid
’arf a mg w’ile she goes an’ gets some milk
for its bottle. Of course I ses ‘Righto,’ an’
offS she bangs. But, struth ! before she gets
back the bloke gives the right-away, an’
’ere’s me nursin’ the baby. The rattler be-
gins to move, so I ’ands the kid outer the
winder to a decent-lookin’ dame on the plat-
form, jus’ drummin’ ’er the strong of it. At
that minit the mother with ’er bottler milk
comes chargin’ back like a cow ’oo’s calf’s off
to the butcher’s. She makes a (lyin’ snatch
at the guard’s van, an’ the bloke drags ’er in.
“W’en we gets to the main line at Dan-
denong she comes bouncin’ to me for ’er kid,
an’ w’en she ’ears it’s been lef’ be’ind she
goes off on me like a charge of dynamite.
Blime, she give me nothin’! I didn’t mind
’er callin’ me a murderer an’ a thief, but
w’en she slung off about me bein’ a rotten
play-actor, she ’ad me fair narked. Me a
actor! I oughter ’ad more sense ’n go with
Coogan.
“Of course there was a ’ullabaloo. Nyora,
w’ere the kid is, is about forty mile off, an’
there ain’t another train either way till nex’
mornin’. The stationmaster was a good
bloke, though, an’ ’e rung up the Nyora
bloke, an’ ’e chats ’im the kid’s orright with
the missus of the stationmaster at Nyora,
’oo’s got kids of ’er own; an’ a silvertail
commercial with a motor-car blows in, an’ ’e
gives the mother a lift to Nyora. She was
’arf ratty with ’appiness, an’ didn’t know
wot she was doin’. ’Ere, she smouched me
in front of the mob —kissed me fair on the
north-an’-south !
“The nex’ train to Melbourne from Dan-
denong didn’t go through till near 10 o’clock,
an’ I’m mooehin’ about on the platform,
tryin’ to kill time waitin’, w’en in come a
coal speshul from Nyora, an’—Gord-save-
our-grashus-King!—the guard’s got the lorst
kid fast asleep in the van! I dunno ’ow it
all finished —I never ’eard. P’raps that pore
woman’s see-sawin’ up an’ down Gippsland
yet after ’er baby.”

Remington Automatic
Pistol Cartridges are
now Oil-Proof!
WHEN ordinary cartridges are left in
automatic arms for any length of time,
oil necessary to lubricate the pistol seeps
past the bullet and primer into the cartridge
case and spoils the powder and priming
mixture. Mis-fires result.

Cartridges, when used in pistols in good
working order, are sure fire always. They
are positively sealed against oil and moisture
