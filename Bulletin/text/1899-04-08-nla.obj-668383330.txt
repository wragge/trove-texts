If I Could Paint,
AND were still an Australian, I would not
worry too much about old masters, sunset
studies, or even horses ; you can study and
enjoy real sunset effects any day and almost
anywhere—in University Park for preference and
convenience ; and Australia is already .smothered
by the horse. Sunlight and scenery endure, and
there are plenty to paint them, but types and
classes are passing away or changing rapidly in
Australia. I’d be prouder of a picture like
“ Breaking the News ” than of a hundred exquisite
alleged studies in “the nood” —which, as they
are, are rather less satisfactory than a study in the
latest Paris fashion would be. The most beautiful
studies in the nude are of children ; but go to
Manly Beach any summer day for the real thing—
with the moving grace and laughter thrown in.
My ambition would be to paint Australia as it
is, and as it changes: pictures that Australians
could look through—and through a mist of tears,
perhaps—back into their pasts : pictures that Aus-
tralians could look through and onward to a
brighter and nobler future. Pictures that the
“ careless ” joker might stand in front of chuck-
ling comfortably to himself, and feel less lonely
and cynical in his heart than careless jokers are
apt to feel. Pictures that might soften hard eyes
and mouths, and so ease hard hearts. Pictures
showing the best and noblest sides of human
nature, so that the world might keep its faith in
it, and love it, or, failing that, be more charitable
and tolerant towards it. Pictures showing the
worst side of humanity, the poverty, misery, and
squalid vice, that men might hate the greed and
selfishness that cause it all. Pictures that would
bring hot tears to the eyes and fire the hearts of
men. And pictures that would make men laugh
and be cheerful in our time.
And if I went to Europe it would be to learn to
paint Australia—not old-world scenes : those who
are old-world-bom can do that better than we. A
Dutch tavern-scene looks picturesque to us—pro-
bably on account of the costumes; but a real
Dutch tavern-scene mightn’t be any more pic-
turesque than our own haggard threepenny-bar.
Pictures of our threepenny-bars might set men
wishing for a different style of pub. and a different
fashion in drinking. The narrow bar—for most
things made by men are narrow and haggard in
this thin, faded time of ours; no seat, except per-
haps a ledge under the window (for seats also, like
verandahs, have narrowed and disappeared : it is
only intended that men should stand in front of a
bar, and drink as long as they can pay for it, and
then go away ; the dmgy little “ parlors ” are for
the accommodation of “ molls ” and their acquaint-
ances). The unpicturesque, unredeemed guzzling
on one side ; and undisguised “ business ” on the
«*ther.
And the humorous side of it, “Breaking the
Law, ” for instance : A group representing or sug-
gesting as many sorts and conditions of ordinary
sinners as possible, by a side-entrance of a cross-
street hotel on Sunday or after hours; one
stooping down to listen or speak through the
keyhole, or giving the knock; make a study
of. his face the face of a born leader in
mischief or otherwise. The atmosphere of
school-boyish guiltiness and watchfulness, with
something of the uneasiness born of mature cau-
tion or experience. The two or three interested
oasuals—without the knowledge of the “lay of
the country; ” or, maybe, without the pluck to
battle for themselves—hanging about the opposite
corner with a poor show of neutrality, and ready
either to stroll on with an assumption of indiffer-
ence at the sight of a policeman, or to slip across
and in after the bolder spirits as soon as a breach
is made. The population of the alley in sym-
pathy, and aiding and abetting, maybe, with
advice and signals. All human in our times.
And, as a companion picture, the bar
lighted by a dim point of gas, or in the dusk
behind drawn blinds. An air as of school-boys
safe in hiding and enjoying stolen fruits after an
orchard-robbing expedition, yet alert and ready
for a surprise ; the irrepressible wink and the soul-
ful grin of the jokers. The one or two dead-
earnest, matter-of-fact characters —generally small
contractors or bosses, who take everything (drink
included) as seriously as they do their jobs and
the “men.”
All human.
The Saturday afternoon drunk who gets drunk
by accident—as we all do, if we do it at all—who
has lost his mates, or is temporarily parted from
them, and has passed the point when he’ll either
go home with the bulk of his wages or make a
night of it; see him with his back to a support,
solemnly arguing or putting the case to himself,
and striking off the main points (for or against)
with one forefinger across the other. The boozers’
boat on Saturday night. And—well, it’s a pity
that there is so much humor, wit, and sympathy
in drinking. Isn’t it? . . . But change to
Faddy’s Market, Saturday night—a world of
types, pathos, and tragedy there. The usual
haggard-featured mother going from one entrance
to another of the markets; a boarding-house
keeper with two or three grown-up, white-shirted,
stand-oip-and-turn-down-collared (mother does all
their linenJherself) straw-hatted, cigarette-smoking
sons (boarding at 'home and paying 12s. or 15s. a
week), apeing men-about-town in King-street to-
night. She has the ordinary load of Sunday-
dinner-stuff on one arm, and a great, peevish brat
on the other, two or three trailing behind, or hang-
ing on her skirts. She turns sharply, at last, goaded
to it, and, in a shrill half-shriek : “Be quiet, blast
yer ! (that I should say such a thing) where am I to
get hokey-pokey money from?” I’d like to paint her
and the children:—and the ‘ ‘ nan-nan ” sons hurrying
past in the background. I’d call it “Nit! there’s
Mother.” Where was she to get hokey-pokey
money from ?
Then, in the face of Mother Grundy and to the
advancement of Australia—the slums—there are
miles of ’em now —and the poor of Sydney. The
interiors of brothels (where little girls keep the
door when “ Aunty ” is at the pub., or too drunk),
and Chinese dens (for European and Australian
types as well as Chinese—the variety of types and
feminine beauty would surprise you a bit, I
reckon.) The patrol of the prostitutes at night in
Elizabeth, Bathurst, College, and Hunter-streets :
splendid types, some of them, and there is plenty
of street light to allow of effect. Our civilisation
has advanced so that these are no longer shy of
light and crowds.
The drovers, the teamsters, the shearers, the
station hands, the cookies, the diggers—and the
acts and scenes of their lives—what place have
these m our galleries ? I would paint the shearing
shed as it is ; the swagman tramping through the
heat, and the swagman tramping through the
rain (paint, but not hang in Australia); the
swagmen’s camps and the selectors’ homes; the
bush-women : the drovers riding home with their
dogs and pack-horses after a long trip—on wiry,
ungroomed stock-horses and burned brown, and
ragged and dusty, and with the patient weariness
of 500 miles of dry country in their eyes. .
The selector—take a scene at random—” The Last
Tree on Our Selection.” A great gum grubbed
out and that moment fallen; the cloud of dust
from the branches : the hard, caked clay flying
from the butts of the roots ; the great tap-root
cut through; the rush of dogs into the head of
the tree after a colony of ’possums long left un-
disturbed in the hollows of the branches. The
selector standing back, leaning on his axe and
wiping his forehead. . . Or a long-ago abandoned
goldfield in the rain, and with the spirit of the
past haunting it. . . . Two old diggers work-
ing the old field over again, pegging out old claims
anew (as they would have been pegged out in
the first place had' diggers been able to see
through the ground) jabbing down shafts and
following workings with their index fingers on the
table—Gulgong, or any of these in the Roaring
Days. We have the dresses, tents, cradles, ready
to our hand in crude but faithful old water-colours
done on the spot. And wild and strange and
mixed and ” enough for anything such a
scene would look. Do you know that men wore
hats with ribbons to them, and capes, and other
outlandish things, those days in Australia ? And
well-greased ringlets and earrings were common.
And stockmen wore strapped trousers. Do you
know what strapped pants are ? We’ll rip the
side and ’tween-leg seams of a pair of pants, take
the back out altogether and put a new one in of a
different colour, that will give you some idea——
no, it’s not that ; get on ahorse, draw a chalk-line
in curves all round the spaces of contact between
you and the saddle and horse, get a woman to cub
out and sew neatly over the spaces enclosed, a
length of good saddle tweed, taking care that the
colours are something in harmony. Then you’ll
have a pair of strapped trousers, and if you’ve got
good legs and the trousers fit close as riding pants
should, very natty they’ll look. What were they
for? Why, for riding in, of course. The old
poverty-advertising ashamed patch carried to
extremes and made fashionable. Would be a
grand thing now-a-days when a well-made pair of
pants go behind prematurely, through too much
thinking.
Then, again: The Rescue Party “packing
water ” and fighting out across the plains in the
furnace-blast of the terrible drought. The “Death
of Thirst ” for the sake of Wool, Tallow, Hides
& Co.
“ The Ride for the Doctor.” Take an ordinary
plain bush girl—the brave mother-sister of the
family, riding (man’s saddle, perhaps—shabby old
apology for a riding skirt) on a rough track
through the lonely bush, under dark brooding
ridges, on the “old grey horse ’’—broken-winded,
but settled down to it and running bullock-like ;
the girl’s face drawn and haggard through anxiety
and want of sleep, and all but hopeless—whiter in
the ghostly daybreak, but brave; and in it the
fixed purpose of unconscious heroism. Thin lips
dry and set, great tears of fear, pain and weari-
ness dropping from the wide-open eyes that seem
to have lost the power of ever closing in sleep
again, fixed on the distant ridge beside which lie
the town, hope and the doctor. Thirty miles from
home. Paint that picture ! Or “The Bush
Doctor ”in the hut. . . . “The Crisis.” . . . The
parting between the bushman and the dootor after
the danger has passed.
And a picture that should be painted. Plain
girl again: “Sweet ugly woman of the past.”
The only one with a trace of refinement in a rough
bush family, too proud or too sensitive to live at
home, she studies at night-school; she is slave to
the brats, cows, “poddy calves” and selection
generally all day, and eventually she is appointed
teacher to some out-back State-school, or two half-
time schools maybe, and “ boards” in such homes
as I have sketched, where every sight, sound,
smell —every word almost—is repellent to her
nature. This girl, by a slab school-house in a
dusty patch in the eternal, God-forgotten, body-
mind-and-soul-destroying scrub, “ marking time ”
before a row of half-savage children, of whom the
youngest might be as tall as herself. Paint her in
school ; paint her at home—and the surroundings.
Paint her kneeling by her bed, or in school
after hours, arms thrown out on the desk, aching
head down, in utter loneliness, hopelessness and
weariness of life.
The angry diggers and the soldiers face to face
on Lambing Flat, and the Commissioner on the
stump speaking to the diggers after the first shot
had been fired ! . . . Way back of it all the Roll-
Up, on Ballarat. “ The Night - before Eureka ”;
the diggers kneeling under the flag. The day-
dawn tight at Eureka Stockade. Thomas Kennedy
marching from Creswick at the head of his men,
through the night-storm, flourishing his sword
and singing a wild rebel song—marching to battle
and fighting in imagination, no doubt, for
his own country, and striking, indirectly, the
grandest blow that was ever struck for Australia.
The meeting called “to strengthen the hands of
the Government,” and the doom of bad govern-
ments written in stern faces. The scene outside
the courthouse where justice was done.
And, for scenery, the lung-tilling depths and
distances of hundreds of unknown places like
McDonald's Hole and Capertree Valley. “Grim
grey coasts and sea-boards ghastly.” The
Darling River rising from far-off Queens-
land rains ; drought blazing down to a narrow
dark band of soakage between the water and
ashen banks. The yellow water rising in the
branohes of trees, and over high level < wY>r?. the
grass will sprout fresh and green—phantom or
unreal-looking sheets of water sheading through
the broiling scrubs. ... A camp on the sea
beach, jagged edges and gums softened in the
moonlight, mountain streams running down and
spreading over the sands to the sea—all the
world far and faint—faint and far, mates dream-
ing, smoking, and yarning lazily round camp-fire.
And—rest and peace for awhile.
HENRY LAWSON .
Gladstone as Orator.
Lecky’s new edition of “ Democracy and
Liberty ” is prefaced by a long introduction,
which appreciates Gladstone interestingly.
Some extracts come by way of Literature.
Lecky compares Gladstone with Burke.
“ Both of the two orators,” he says
Carried into political questions a passion seldom
round among statesmen, and also a range and
versatility of knowledge that far surpassed that of
their contemporaries, but Gladstone was incom-
parably superior to Burke in the power of moving
great masses of men, dominating in Parliamentary
debate, catching the tone and feeling of every
aud tence he addressed, and carrying an immediate
issue. On the other hand, the texture of
his intellect was commonplace. The subtleties
and ingenuities of distinction in which he was in-
exhaustibly fertile were nearly always the mere
subtleties of debate. His long and involved sen-
tences and the extreme redundancy of his lan-
guage scarcely impaired the effect of his speeches
when they were set off by his clear, musical and
powerful voice, and by his admirable skill in
enunciation and emphasis, but to the reader they
will often appear intolerably verbose.
Of course the real gist of the matter (says
Literature ), and with it the true secret of Mr.
Gladstone’s success, is to be found in those
parts of the description which concern the
unrivalled physical gifts of the orator. Ora-
tory, in fact, considered as a practical, and
distinguished from an aesthetic art—oratory
regarded purely as an instrument of imme-
diate persuasion—will always depend, to the
extent of some four-fifchs of its efficiency,
on physical qualities, its moral and intellec-
tual elements being represented in the pro-
portion of about one-tenth each. When, in-
deed, it is oratory addressed to “ the masses,”
as all Mr. Gladstone’s temporarily effec-
tive efforts were, a rigorous investigation
of it would be found to yield something like
the following analytical report:—“ Personal
magnetism of the orator—a combination of
vocal, facial, gestural, and emotional appeals
to the senses of his audience, 95 per cent,;
moral earnestness, or the semblance of it,
6 per cent.; reason—a trace.” We do not
pledge ourselves to the exact applicability of
this analysis to all Mr. Gladstone’s greatest
popular performances ; in some of them the
second and third ingredients may have been
present in somewhat higher proportions, but
what we do say is that any given speech of
his—say in Mid Lothian in 1879 —would have
been equally effective if its composition had
been precisely as above stated. Of the
external characteristics of the great orator
Mr. Lecky has made a curiously minute
study, and he gives its results with an
occasionally refreshing bluntness. No one,
as he truly says, could stand before a good
portrait of Gladstone without feeling that
“ he was in the presence of an extraordinary
man.”
Yet the greatest painter could only represent
one of the many moods of that ever changing and
most expressive countenance. Few men have had
so many faces, and the wonderful play of his
features contributed very largely to the effective-
ness of his speaking. It was a countenance
eminently fitted to express enthusiasm, pathos,
profound melancholy, commanding power, and
lofty disdain: there were moments when it could
take an expression of intense ounning, and it often
darkened into a scowl of passionate anger. In
repose it did not seem to me to be good. With its
tightly-compressed lips, and fierce, abstracted
gaze, it seemed to express not only extreme deter-
mination, but also great vindictiveness—a quality,
indeed, by no means wanting in his nature, though
it was, I think, more frequently directed against
classes than individuals. He had a wonderful eye
—a bird-of-prey eye—fierce, luminous, and rest-
less. “When he differed from you,” a great
friend and admirer of his once said to me, “there
were moments when he would give you a glance as
if he would stab you to the heart. ”
And, in illustration of these ocular peculiari-
ties of his, Mr. Lecky cites the following
somewhat comic anecdote related to him by
the late Sir Edgar Boehm :
He told me that he was once present when an
altercation between him and a Scotoh professor
took place, and that the latter started up from the
table to make an angry reply when he suddenly
stopped as if paralysed or fascinated by the glance
of Gladstone, and Boehm noticed that the pupil of
Gladstone’s eye was visibly dilating, and the eye-
lid round the whole circle of the eye drawing back
as may be seen in a bird of prey.
This peculiar property in Mr. Gladstone’s
eye can hardly, perhaps, have been of much
use to him in addressing large popular audi-
ences, but there is no doubt that-, for all
hearers who were near enough to see the
play of his features, that expressive mobility
of countenance which Mr. Lecky describes
did much to enhance the effect of his wonder-
ful voice. But even all these explanations
of Mr. Gladstone’s persuasive power still
leave a considerable margin to the unex-
plained ; and this, in our opinion, may best
be filled up by the suggestion that what
most critics treat as a defect of his oratory —
as of course it is, sesthetically considered —
its extreme verbosity, was, from the
practical point of view, a main factor in
its success. Those who have watched the
effect upon large mixed audiences of
the combination of vocal and elocutionary
charm with an inexhaustible fluency of speech
will readily appreciate this. A speaker with
a powerful and melodious voice, who never
hums and ha’s, never pauses for a word,
never leaves a sentence unfinished, but flows
on unbrokenly and perpetually like the river
before the eyes of Horace’s rustic —in omne
volubilis cevam —begins, after the lapse of
a quarter of an hour or so, to exercise a sort
of hypnotic influence over the mass of his
hearers, who end by yielding to his per-
suasions, an assent which they believe to be
intellectual, but which is in large measure a
response to a purely sensuous appeal.

Good-bye.
A star in the west
Hangs low o’er a hill, tree-crowned.
The moon in the east
Stares down at us full and round.
A curlew’s low cry
Echoes, and is answered again.
A wind in the trees
Murmurs, and dies on the plain.
Wait, stand here ;
This is the end, dear, of all.
A bat flits by ;
At our feet a cricket’s shrill call.
Blame you? Not I.
You are right, so the world says, you know.
“You love me ! ”
Repeat it again and again, perhaps it is so.
“ Believe you ! ”
O, yes, I believe, the warm touch of your hand
That trembles in mine ;
Would make me believe, but—l don’t understand
You love me?
Yet this touch of suspicion has grown
You love me !
And distrust me at once. I’m stupid, I own.
Your lips, dear,
Are mine, and your eyes ; love is sweet.
But your trust
I must have to make the perfect complete.
’Tis not given,
The world intervenes. Daren’t you face evil
breath ?
Oh, my love,
With a love for a love that is braver and stronger
than death.
Good-bye, then !
You shiver and tremble; the wind has grown
chill,
The star in the West
Has sunk now behind the low hill.
Good-bye—ah, Good-bye !
We must part. Had you trusted me, sweet
But it’s over.
Ah, Rirl! for a love that is lost, for a trust incom-
plete !
A. LEO WATTS.
Provence.
[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
In old Provence I long to stray,
All for the old love’s sake,
For there in far-off times a lay
I sang to you at close of day
Beside the garden lake.
Sad in the summer twilight air—
O, dusk of summer eves! —
Around sat knight and lady fair;
I saw them not for you were there,
My love, beneath the leaves.
I sang to you of perished things,
Of love that sighs alone,
We seemed to hear death’s mournful wings
Sweep as he passed the trembling strings,
So deep and sad their tone.
No other love could be for me,
No other love for you ;
But you were born of high degree,
And I but lord of minstrelsy
Who lodge ’mid forest dew.
Wasted by time we fell asleep
With hearts unsatisfied ;
But love like ours must sow and reap,
And in the dark of death’s still keep
For ever may not bide.
And so beneath this lofty lime
We add unto our joy
The sweetness of that buried time
When you were young and heard the rhyme
Of wandering minstrel boy.
Tas.
JAMES HEBBLETHWAITE.
A Bulletin correspondent :
The generosity of Vie. Govt, towards the laborer is
princely A mob of men put on to a railway job in
Goulburn Valley district were paid a price that yielded
just 12s. a man for a fortnight’s hard work under a
blazing 105' sun. Despairing of making tucker with the
pick they hired a plough, and the extra earnings just
paid’ for the implement and the horse. Then the men
‘‘chucked it,” and joined the Melb. unemployed, and are
scornfully accused of not wanting work. The official
mind deduces from the unceasing clamor for work the
conclusion that the “ lower orders ” should be thankful
for work without wages.
“ C.S.” gossips about the “ Geisha ” :
The “ Chon Kino,” or “Chon Newke,” music in “ The
Geisha” reminds me of the old Japan days. “Chon
Kino,” or “ Newke,” is a sort of rhythmic swaying and
posturing of strong suggestiveness, and, considering the
general disrobing into which the performance developes,
the hearing of the air at a Sydney swell show makes any-
body in the “ know ” sit up considerably. “ Chon Kino ”
is now tabu in Japan ; but time was when the seeker after
naked truth in, say, Nagasaki could order his Chon Kino
and invite a few friends to assist —it being a mere detail
that, the number of said friends always happened to cor-
respond with that of the performing ladies. The details are
too blushful for print in any Brunker-bossed community.
Often Chou Kino was followed by dumb-show scenes of
an eye-startling character. The Geishas of 20 years ago,
by the way, were analogous to the old Greek hetairai ;
and pre-marital continence was hardly ever expected, but
for adultery the punishments were diabolical : as, for in-
stance, the burial-alive of the lady up to the chin in
quicklime and the administering of thirst-provokers and
subsequent copious draughts of water. The male culprit,
if not slain, was dealt with in a way that effectually pre-
vented repetition of the offence. On the coast of the
Inland Sea the erring pair used to be lashed, naked and
back to back, on a wooden cross weighted at the foot,
and the affair was then pitched into the sea and left,
with the heads above the surface, to float around until
the offenders perished.

The Legend.
IT was in the summer of 1778, Wash-
ington, with his army ever active,
determined to oppose the British
general, Sir Henry Clinton, who, having
evacuated Philadelphia, was retreating
through Hew Jersey on Hew York. The
forces met on 28th June at Monmouth.
La Fayette conducted the attack. The
heat was so intense that some refused to
fight, and many fell dead from exposure
to the sun’s rays. Both sides fought
desperately. As the day waned, and the
flagging spirits of La Fayette’s soldiers
were at a low ebb, a strange sight aroused
them. Marching with drum and fife
was an old man, Jeremiah Wynton, and
his son, and grandson. The old father,
with silvery flowing locks, sturdily strode
through the field. The son with ban-
daged head fifing lustily, the youth,
catching the spirit of his grandsire, rolled
out with him the soul-inspiring rattle of
the drum. Father, son, and grandson
had accompanied the troops as volunteers,
and were ever in the forefront of the
fight. The fierce light of battle was in
their eyes, they knew no fear, and many
a wild cheer arose, as on that fateful
day Yankee Doodle was heard as never
was heard before or since.

SATURDAY, APRIL 8, 1899.
Swamping the Council.
Australia is still waiting for New South
Wales before the Federal question can get
any further forward. The Federal session
has come and gone and left things as they
were. Either through treachery, or in-
capacity, or through the natural slowness of
a man who labors under much fat, or through
a desire to be painfully constitutional in all
his methods, or through deep policy, Premier
Reid again deliberately wasted his oppor-
tunity, and when the new session opens a
few days hence the Enabling Bill has to be
started again from the beginning. It was to
all intents and purposes a foregone con-
clusion that the Legislative Council would
block the measure ; it has all along been
notoriously provincialist, and the resignation
of four enthusiastic federalists— Barton,
Lees, and the two O’Connors —to contest
Assembly constituencies at the late general
election left the Upper House even more
unanimously provincialist than it was be-
fore. And when Premier Reid sent up the
Federal Enabling Bill without first filling
with reliable Federalists the thirteen or
fourteen vacancies in that much-reduced
body, he delivered the measure into the
hands of its sworn enemies. When a
mangled fragment of it came back to him
after many days—a fragment that had been
run over by the wheels of controversy, and
chewed by the teeth of prejudice, and blown
to and fro by the winds of the Old Men’s
scorn—the result was only what might have
been expected. And the Old Men, who
howled so joyfully when they sent back the
mangled fragment, have thereby given
Premier Reid a most valuable advertise-
ment. For if he likes to keep firm he must
win ; with the majority which he and
Barton can raise in the Assembly there is
no other possibility in the case. But in
addition he has a chance to pose as the
valiant fat man who fought against great
opposition and overcame a big constitutional
difficulty in advancing the cause of union,
and he gets the laurels and the limelight and
the other profits. If the Enabling Bill had
gone through in peace Reid would only have
been the light porter who humped the parcel
along. As it is he has a chance to appear as
a conqueror—which is something consider-
ably higher than a porter.
* * * *
The Council has certainly furnished its
enemy with a great opportunity. Its action
helps to consolidate the league between Reid
and Barton. Together they have such a
majority that if Reid demands the right to
appoint 20 or 30 or 40 new M.’sL.C. the
Lieutenant-Governor must either accept or
leave himself without a Ministry, for the
scraps which make up the Haynes and Lynß
and M‘Laughlin party can’t possibly form a
Government with a workable majority.
Reid can figure as the strong man, the
master of the situation, the politician who
downed the House of Tory Obstruction and
gave the law to the vice-regal figurehead, the
boss Democrat and defender of the rights of
the people—and the Council has given him
all this free advt., and put all this cheap
and easy victory within his reach. No
man can gain the credit of saving the
country unless it has first been lost, and the
Council has a stupid and futile habit of try-
ing to lose the country, whereby it furnishes
an admirable opportunity for its enemy to
plunge in and make a sensational rescue.
* * * *
But however the Federal crisis came about
there is no shadow of doubt that Premier
Reid is doing the right thing now. Every
real Democrat, and every real Federalist,
and every honest anti-Federalist will support
him in his course of action. If the matter is
put fairly the question at issue is one
to which a self-governing community can
give only one answer. Whatever his
past record may be, and whatever his
motives may be, George ReID is now
fighting for the self-governing rights of the
people—nothing more. The New South
Wales Assembly, which backs Reid, de-
mands that the vexed question of union or
disunion shall, as speedily as is con-
venient, be submitted to the people,
that the majority of those voting shall
decide, and that those who don’t take
enough interest in the matter to vote at all
shall be left out of the calculation—as they
always are, and that Federalism and Pro-
vincialism shall have a perfectly equal show.
The Council, which doesn’t support Reid,
demands that the majority shall not neces-
sarily decide. And the Council party raised
a feeble clamor that the Assembly should be
dissolved, and that the Reid Ministry should
ask a fresh mandate from the people before
proceeding to swamp the Council—that it
should ask the majority of the people (at the
election) to decide whether the majority of
the people should be allowed to decide (at
the referendum); but the suggestion is mere
burlesque. If it was proposed that the
Parliament should, on its own responsibility ,
make New South Wales a part of the Com-
monwealth, then it would be a fair thing to
demand that Parliament should be dissolved
at the last moment so as to give the people a
final opportunity to say whether they were
taking any Commonwealth or not. The
same rule would apply if the Parliament
was going to do anything else of supreme
importance on its own responsibility.
But the present case is utterly unlike
any previous one in Australia’s his-
tory, and the old rules don’t apply. Par-
liament doesn't propose to do anything,
except get home as soon as possible, and
have a rest, and get the cheque for its salary
regularly. The Federal question is left to
the people. And to dissolve Parliament
in order to give the majority a chance to
decide whether it believes or doesn’t believe
that the majority should decide is ridiculous.
All the country wants to say about the
Federation scheme will be said on Refer-
endum Day.
* * * •
So long as it is accepted that the electors
are the last court of appeal, then there is no
room for argument between the House
which wants to leave matters to the decision
of the majority and the one which doesn’t.
The only thing to do is to swamp the latter
in one act—or else give up the theory of
popular government. Even if it requires
40 new nominations to bring the result
about, that doesn’t matter. The essential
point is that this time there should be no
mistake. The provincialist party’s majority
in the Council ran as high as 15 during the
recent debates, and there are probably a
half-dozen, or perhaps a dozen, more ancients
who could be brought down in ambulances
on an emergency to vote that the present
state of things is good enough for them, and
that because they are too old to change no
one else should be allowed to change either.
If the Reid Government, in its desire to
adhere to a mouldy precedent about the
relative sizes of the two Chambers, appoints
a batch of new members which will just .
enable it to miss its mark by a hair’s-breadth
after all, the situation will be ridiculous as
well as dangerous. The country in general
doesn’t care how large the Council is, and
even if it is increased to 100 members
nobody is likely to object much. The un-
paid gentlemen roll up so reluctantly that
on all ordinary occasions, even with a
House of 100 members, it is hardly likely
that more than 30 would be present. The
country doesn’t pay its Councillors, so 100
of them would cost practically the same as ;
the present 57. Also, 100 couldn’t well be
more stupid than 57. The only real diffi-
culty seems to be about seating accommoda-
tion on the rare occasions when there is a
very large muster, and even then a few cane
chairs could be borrowed from somewhere,
or the last arrivals could camp on the floor.
PLAIN ENGLISH.
Kingston Appeals to the Dry Countree.
South Australia has a general election in a few
weeks, and all the present signs are that Pre-
mier Kingston will come back safely to take
another turn of office. Kingston already has
a record of continuous office such as no other
S.A. Premier ever approached ; if he can hang
out till 16th June he will have held his billet
for six consecutive years. He is almost the
first real Premier that South Australia has
possessed ; his predecessors, who scuffled in
and out of the Ministerial jobs every few
months, and were regarded as having put up
an amazing record if they hung on for two
years, were mostly myths. Kingston’s record
up to date as a democratic statesman rests
mainly on the facts that he created the State
Land Bank, passed a measure authorising the
State to acquire large landed properties for
closer settlement, restricted colored immigra-
tion, gave the franchise to women, passed a
conciliation law, and a useful Factories
Act, and a law for the protection
of homes from creditors, enacted the graduated
land-tax and the absentee-tax which are
steadily grinding up the huge land monopolies
of S. A., and did all in his power to help the
cause of Australian unity. Also, he did his
utmost to carry a radical reform of the Upper
House, and promises to renew the struggle next
session if he and his portfolio still hang
together. He asks for a renewed lease of
power on the further grounds that he favors
elective Ministries, the referendum, State fire
insurance, a State bank of issue, and most of
the other reforms that the democratic party
aims at; that he has lived honestly up to his
programme in the past, and done more for the
good of the masses than most of his predeces-
sors put together ; and that though his finance
hasn’t been good it has been at least an im-
provement on that of his immediate predeces-
sors. And the S.A. democracy can’t do better
than take another spell of Kingston. There is
no one to put in his place who looks one-tenth
as promising as the fighting man of many mixed
nationalities who has steered S.A. through the
last few calamitous years. Considering w'hat
awful years of drought and dust they have
been, the Kingston regime has been in hard
luck all along. It has struck almost
the leanest period in S.A.’s history; and
yet, despite all the prophecies of inevitable
ruin from the party of “ Turncoat Bill ”
Cor ky and the great bore Ward, it has pro-
duced about as good results as the other crowd
did in much fatter days. And, after all, re-
sults count for a great deal more than the
gruesome prophecies of “Jeremiah ” Copley.
The Westralian Bubble.
From “ A Man who has Come Back
Easterners hear few candid reports about Westralia.
Distance has lent a spurious enchantment to the so-called
“Golden West.” But boom-times have passed, and
Westralia is suffering: a bad recovery. Yet it may seem
strange that a territory of 23 million acres, in the hands
of 170,000 people, should feel such a depression. Respon-
sible Govt, was ushered in with rich discoveries of gold,
increased population and capital, and no party could have
had better opportunities than had the Forrest crowd.
As events prove no party could have made a worse mess.
Of course no one expected the abnormal state of affairs
accompanying’ the mining development to last—except
boomster Forrest, who spent public money in a manner
reckless beyond conception. Westralia has come to the
end of its tether. With high cost of living and scarcity
of employment the candle burning at both ends does not
last long. So the West at the present time is about the
very worst place to go to.
However, Forrest will be the last man to believe that
W.A. has been grossly mismanaged, and is likely to suffer
still more keenly the reaction from an abnormal state of
things. Everlastingly he trots out the gold-yield as an
argument in support of the province’s prosperity. But
the prosperity of a country ought to he represented bv
the individual prosperity of the people, not by the special
prosperity of the few mines. The W.A. gold-yield is mag-
nificent and ought to be sufficient to redeem the country,
but the people there are under the disadvantage of having
the mining industry worked by companies nearly all
foreign. The result is the gold-yield is all exported, as
well as the bulk of the wages obtained in winning it;
Owing to the cost of living, miners will hot bring theif
wives to W.A. All very well to talk about the province’s
future from a mining standpoint. No doiibt there is A
future for the mines, but under present auspices there is
none for the province.
There is a Considerable export 6f timber to Europe and
South Africa. W.A. cart be justly proud 6f its timber re-
sources, but the timber industry, like the mining in-
dustry, is controlled by foreign capital. With two or
three exceptions, the profits all go to London. The
timber is shipped in the log, and, beyond the cost of falling
and handling, the province reaps little benefit. Hundreds
of acres of the finest tree-country are devastated yearly,
but a year’s revenue from the whole industry is only about
equal to the value of one good boat-load of jari ah. As
to the agricultural industry, no one seems to know much
about it. Owing to the fact that nearly all the food sup-
plies have to be imported some attention has been paid
to farming. But it is highly questionable whether there
is any land with adequate depth of soil; even the best
wheat-land needs manuring. After all it is not a great
task to feed 170,000 people, and as for agriculture it can
be carried on more profitably in the east and in Maori-
land. The pastoral industry is run by native labor, and
is so remote that its influence in the labor-market is’ not
felt. The question has been often asked, who are the
pastoralists ? The butchers’ ring. The bulk of the meat
consumed is imported by the butchers’ ritig—a political
combination—which is protected to the extent that it
costs from 3s, to 4s. to land a sheep in W.A;; arid £4 td
land a bullock. Like everything feise the nlcht-trade is
controlled by a few. Let Atiy ohe else’try’tb chip in arid
see how long he will last;
Putting aside the mining industry— and the British
capitalist is having a well-earned rest on the money he
has already sunk—it in ay be asked what are the legiti-
mate Outlets for Capital V Perth has been overbuilt, but for
t’othersiders who have had to pay the gropers exorbitant
rents, or get what Forrest calls a stake in the country—
a bit of sand and a humpy—the overbuilding is not an
unmixed evil, for it must materially reduce the cost of
living. Landlords have been getting 30 per cent, on
their outlay, but as there were over 600 houses empty in
Perth the other day, they will have to be content with
much less. It is certainly not an agreeable prospect to a
class of people whose daily prayer is “ God bless John
Forrest.” As for the Premier, he has been so long in
power that he has really come to believe he is there by
divine right.
The Premier has really to thank the Electoral Act
for his long-continued reign. Ostensibly the W.A.
electoral qualification is 12 months residence in the pro-
vince, but in reality it takes on the average three years
to get on the roll. After living a year in Westralia, the
would-be elector must reside six months in the one elec-
torate before he can start to apply. The franchise may
be wide enough, but there are so many ways for dis-
qualification, especially in an unsettled' country, that
three years is the average period for qualification for a
voice in Parliamentary representation. There is wide
but impotent dissatisfaction with Forrest and his policy
culminating in the Coolgardie water-scheme with its
four-million debt strangling a mere handful of people.
But the Sandgroper’s prayer is ever “ God bless Sir John.”
It is a peculiar country, but there is a day of reckoning
coming. Someone will have to pay the piper. If that
somebody is the old resident he won’t care to stand it
all, and the t’othersider won’t stand taxation for ever with-
out representation.

Holman’s History.
Labor-member Holman turned up the other
day at Bulli (N.S. W.) to misinform the people
about the proposed Federal Constitution, and
to garble a lot of facts in the provincialist in-
terest. The following is a most interesting
hunk of the speech of that fluent and in-
accurate young man, quoted from the report of
the admiring Telegraph :
There were two distinctly opposing kinds of Federation,
the one provided that in the federated community the
majority should rule, and there was no more reason why
the majority should not rule in a Federation than
in a single State. Switzerland, Canada, and Ger-
many were prosperous examples of Federation. Under
the specious guise of talk about a majority of
States, a minority of the people might impose their
will on a vast majority. These two kinds of Federation
were as utterly distinct from one another as the Poles
were asunder. The one kind exalted a nation ; the
second crushed and degraded it. The second kind of
Federation had only been tried once, and that was in t.he
United States of America, and it was the most gigantic
failure associated with the American name, America had
a record of a century and 16 years of failure. The men
who drew up the Draft Constitution for tlie Australian
Commonwealth had shut their eyes wilfully to all the
successful examples, and had blindly copied the gigantic
failure of America.
Pity the Labor*party’s gushful orator doesn’t
learn as well as talk, and get to know his book
a little better. For the proposed Australian
Federal Constitution is to a great extent a copy
of that of Switzerland, which Holman holds up
as a shining example, and presents only a casual
resemblance to that of the United States,
which he disapproves. The matters in which
the proposed Australian Constitution departs
from strict majority rule are the equal repre-
sentation of the States in the Senate, and the
necessity for a majority of States as well as a
majority of people to concur in any change of
Constitution. And this compares with the
system in some other Federations as follows
United States : States have all equal representation in
the Senate. Constitution can be altered with the assent of
two-thirds of the House of Representatives, two-thirds of
the Senate, and three-fourths of the States.
Germany : States have unequal representation. Amend-
ments of the Constitution require an absolute majority of
the Reichstag, and the assent of two-thirds of the
Bundesrath.
Switzerland : States have equal representation in the
Senate. Constitution can be altered by vote of a bare
majority of the Legislature, a majority of the people
voting, and a majority of the States. Also a majority of
the people voting and of the States can alter it without
reference to the Legislature.
Australia (proposed): States to have equal representa-
tion in the Senate. Constitution to be alterable by the
assent of a majority of the Legislature, a majority of the
people voting, and a majority of the States.
The makers of the Australian Constitution
actually made a close copy of the system which
Holman barracks for and which Holman’s
party holds up as the model constitution of the
earth ; and carefully avoided the worst evils of
the American system which Holman objects to.
And Holman, it would appear, deliberately
turns the position upside down, and curses the
Convention for doing the very thing it avoided
and for not doing what it did, and is a ridiculous
blind leader of the eyeless multitude in general.
“The Bulletin’s” Casual Prophet.
Methusalem writes in a spirit of prophecy
trimmed with beer :
Everything was perfectly lovely. The important pro-
vince of Two Ales had at last definitely decided to bestow
the boon of Federation upon the rest of Mixedalia. The
Two-Aleians had made sporadic attempts to do this be-
fore, but on each occasion some far-seeing citizen had
discovered —fortunately in time—that Federation meant
annihilation and disintegration to the State of Two Ales,
and the idea was dropped enthusiastically. The obstacle
all along had been a very simple one. When the sugges-
tion was first formulated, the Two-Aleians had been
under the natural impression that Federation merely
meant the recognition of Two Ales as the leading dog ot
the pack. Therefore Two Ales came forward and joy-
fully proposed that everybody should federate with her.
Then it transpired that the insignificant other provinces
entertained the preposterous notion that Federation
meant “ pool the meat and every dog gets a bite.” And

[FOR THE BULLETIN. ]
“ What’s this about a Bill ?
When a fellow’s feeling ill
They needn’t interrupt him at a banquet or a
jaunt 1
It seems that they are prating
Of some kind of Federating ;
But I’m waiting for particulars ” —said John H.
Want.
“ I’m utterly in doubt
As to what it’s all about;
‘ Federation ’ seems familiar —but remember it I
can’t.
Stay—l think there was some mention,
Long ago, of a ‘ Convention ’ —
I’ve forgotten the particulars”—said John H.
Want.
“ Wait a bit! Were there some jobbers—
Some wolves, or thieves, or robbers—
That I prosecuted lately ? Yes, now 1 think Upon’fc,
Some burglar—a real bad ’un-
called Barton—^ yes—or Braddon —
But I’m hazy on particulars ” —said John H.
Want.
“ I’ve remembrance, dim and shredded,
Of some ‘monster hydra-headed,’
And ‘beastliness,’ and ‘ haloes,’ and a lot of lurid
rant:
Yes ! yes ! —and was there not
Sir Something Someone’s Blot ?

“ I have it! Yes, yes—Barton !
And that Bill he set his heart on !
I suppose they want to pass it with amendments—
but they shan’t.
Why, it wasn’t worth a curse—
And it seems that this one’s worse !
But I’ll cable for particulars”—said John H. Want.
“ George should be overjoy’d -
But it seems he’s quite annoy’d,
And ‘can’t believe Jack said it.’ Well, I didn’t —

when the Two-Aleians realised that it was actually pro-
posed to put them on an equality with everybody else,
the unanimity with which they were not playing in any-
body's yard was touching to behold. After that, at peri-
odical intervals, Two Ales arose, with a charming air of
novelty, and said that really Mixedalia ought to, federate,
you know. And then her neighbors, who didn’t particu-
larly want to unite, and would probably never have
thought of it if it hadn’t been for Two Ales, agreed
wearily, and proceeded to help at constructing Bills. But
the Bills, like all bills, were never satisfactory, for those
stupid States would persist in trying to divide things all
round, instead of handing over the management of every-
thing to Two Ales. And so the latter always retired with
the grace of a hippopotamus emerging from a mud bath.
However, in the year 1916, and after 17 Bills had been
successfully squelched by the frenzied advocates of
Federation in Two Ales, the -matter was beautifully
settled, and everything, at last, was lovely. The other
States had knuckled under, and the last Bill formally re-
cognised Two Ales as second only to Paradise. The
Federal capital was to be situated on the tropical islet of
Pinchgut, in the centre of Kidney Habor. Two Ales was
to have sole control of all the rivers of Mixedalia. The
total revenue was to be paid in to Two Ales to spend exactly
as she pleased. Nohody else was to get anything, and
Two Ales was to get everything. And, at this point, the
Two-Aleians expressed a modified amount of satisfaction
with the concessions, and decided that Federation might
go ahead. And the 18th Bill was about to be passed with
acclamation when a patriotic citizen named Squibbs dis-
covered that it would be suicidal for Two Ales to
Federate. He pointed out that everybody from the sur-
rounding provinces would be obliged to flock into Two
Ales, and that no provision had been made for making
them pay for the extra amount of air which would there-
fore be breathed by the strangers. Mass meetings were
at once held to protest against the “sacrifice” of the
Two Ales air, a petition was drawn up against the Bill,
and Mr. Squibbs was presented with a purse of sovereigns
for his patriotic action in saving Two Ales from the
dangers of Federation. Then the Bill was hung up in
order to have another (the 1275th) amendment added.
Victorian Charity.
Significant item from Melbourne Age :
On 21st January last Constable Cahill, of Royal Park,
arrested a young woman named Annie Smith, whom he
found camping in a culvert in Royal Park, and he charged
her with vagrancy. The girl told the magistrates next
morning that she came from Geelong, and had no friends.
Mrs. Goldspink, of the Abbotsford Convent, offered to
take care of her, and Smith, who expressed her willing-
ness to go with Mrs. Goldspink, was discharged. On
Wednesday evening the police were notified that Smith
and another woman had escaped from the convent by
scaling the 12ft. wall which surrounds the buildings and
dropping to the ground on the other side. The Carlton
police kept a lookout for the women, and on Thursday
evening Constable Cahill found the escapers in the cul-
vert in which he had first arrested Smith, and which is in
a deep gully at the rear of the Zoological Gardens. The
women had just then arrived, and were making prepara-
tions for a stay under the shelter of the bridge. They
were both lodged in the Carlton lockup on charges of
vagrancy. At the local court on Saturday Smith stated
that she left the convent “because she didn’t like it.”
The other accused, a middle-aged woman named Annie
Hayden, stated that she had “ been there for nine
months, and she didn’t like it either ; but she had been
unable to get away before.” The Bench sent each accused
to gaol for 12 weeks.
The Bulletin invites the attention of a logical
Government to these two cases. The charitable
institution at Abbotsford is the place where the
big laundry is. Said laundry, as a “ charitable
institution,” is exempted from the operation
of the Factories Act. There is no minimum-
wage there—in fact, there is no wage at all.
The inmates can be worked at the unceasing
grind of the wash-tub and the mangle for
practically any hours that the management
pleases. And it is, to all intents and purposes,
a prison—the only way out is apparently by
scaling a high wall at night, and when one
of the prisoners escapes the police proceed
to run her down and run her in. Also, it seems
to be an unregulated prison where the confinee’s
sentence has no definite end. Annie Smith
was arrested in the first place because she had
no money—a hideous crime that might surely
be expiated by, say, a month’s confinement.
She did three months’ confinement (and laun-
dry-work) in the Abbotsford institution, and
then, probably thinking it was a case of im-
prisonment for life, she bolted. The police
were informed by her kind bosses, and she was
run in for vagrancy—as she got no wages slie
was naturally just as much of a vagrant as she
had been before. The other woman (also,
apparently, a vagrant) had done nine months of
her indefinite sentence, and as they both got 12
weeks more, that makes six months in one case
and a year in the other. Six months seems a
long term for having no money, and yet if
Annie Smith had remained in the charitable
laundry it seems possible that her sentence
there would have run to years. The other
woman had already done nine months there,
and was apparently not nearly through.
The question is: Under what possible law
are women, for the smallest offences, sen-
tenced to indefinite confinement in anybody’s
wash-house, with no stipulation as to the
kind of treatment meted out to them while
there, and no wages, and with the understand-
ing that they will get a severe sentence for
breaking out, no matter how long a term they
may have served before their escape ? The
arrangement may be charity, but it looks very
like chattel slavery. Will some politician
move for an official inquiry into this and similar
institutions, and for a return showing the
offences for which prisoners were sent there,
and how long each one has been there ? In the
case of a woman who was incapable of scaling
a 12ft. wall, it seems quite possible that the
sentence would spread out like that of the
legendary Prisoner of Chillon. And his sen-
tence wasn’t aggravated by laundry-work.

An Advt. for Digger Dick.
A little crop of crimes, mostly small ones, and
offences and misdoings has arisen in Maoriland
as the immediate result of the Old-Age Pension
scheme, and they are being worked for all they
are worth by the Stagnant Party. The first
death among Digger Dick’s pensioners arose
through the butchery of an old man with an
axe, and another pensioner is in gaol charged
with the offence on his own confession. There
is no positive evidence that the second old
man’s mind was deranged by the sudden receipt
of bis <£lB a year, and that be was driven to
murder by Digger Dick’s pension—but it cer-
tainly seems that he was. There has been a
species of insurrection in Hawera Old Men’s
Home, where the pensioners put on airs, and
stood the institution on its head, and were
finally expelled ; and the first-pensioner at the
Costlev Home (Auckland) got out and had such
a drunk as that cheerless receptacle for the
aged hasn’t seen or heard of for a long, long
time. The Tory press is grieved in its in-
most soul about the immorality of granting
pensions to the aged because of these
few drunks and episodes—which don’t amount
to much after all among 5000 or 6000 pensioners
—and reckons that the money should be stopped
to save the aged from being Lost. Yet, after
all, the Tory organs needn’t be so badly troubled.
Every sudden blessing drives somebody or other
mad until the public gets used to it. When
the American and West Indian slaves were
released, respectable niggers, who might other-
wise have lived to a useful old age, went mad
with excitement and suicided, and fossils of
great tonnage said that their blood was on the
heads of the abolitionists, and that their deaths
showed conclusively that slavery should be re-
established for the nigger’s own protection.
But it wasn’t re-established, and the spasm
passed, and now no nigger is so astonished to
find himself free that he finds it needful
to go mad over it. Also, there have been
cases when men became dangerous lunatics
through the joy of getting out of gaol
after 20 years of confinement, but that doesn’t
prove that everybody should be in gaol.
There have even been instances when men got
their souls saved at religious meetings, and
were so pleased at the thought that they were
not going to hell that they became dotty and
slew the whole family with an axe—also the
dog. This may show that everybody should go
to hell—but it isn’t generally considered in
that light. What strikes The Bulletin most
about the little crop of offences which has
attended the introduction of the pension
system in M.L. is this : Maoriland is without
doubt the most prosperous of the Seven Pro-
vinces. And yet even in Maoriland there were
people so miserable that the joy and astonish-
ment of having 7s. 6d. a week for certain made
some of them get drunk, and some of them
start a small insurrection in their benevolent
asylum, and drove one so completely off his
aged dot that the result was homicide. When
these venerables get used to their bloated
affluence they will simmer down and become
ordinary members of society again the
average human isn’t usually driven mad
by 7s. 6d. a week. But the depth of woe
from which some of them were rescued
may be judged by their wild excitement at
even the small measure of relief which Seddon’s
scheme affords them. And the Maoriland Tory
party wants to keep these old wrecks in their
former state—the state wherein 7s. 6d. a week
is so unusual that the sight of it endangers
their sanity. The Bulletin reckons that that
aged individual who went crazy after getting
his first instalment and axed his mate is about
the best advt. Seddon’s policy has had up to
date.
A Double Event.
The Anti-Federal party’s demand that N.S.W.
shall not federate unless Queensland comes in,
even if Victoria, Tasmania, S.A. and Westralia
are all willing, combined with its loud assur-
ance that Queensland doesn’t care a straw for
Federation, is a very interesting double event.
The situation, if carefully reasoned out, goes
into these four propositions : (1) Queens-
land, according to the Anti-Federal crowd,
doesn’t really want to federate now. (2) If
the other provinces federate, however, it is
difficult for it to stand out, as it wants the free
run of the southern market for its sugar ;
therefore, the shortest way to bring Queensland
in is to explain that the other provinces are
going to federate, anyhow. (3) If the other
provinces federate, Queensland wants to be in
at the beginning so as to have a voice in the
fixing of the capital, and to get it as near its
border as possible; therefore, again, the
shortest way to bring Queensland in is to ex-
plain that the other provinces are going to
federate in any case, and if it wants to have
the capital near its border it must join now.
(4) Therefore, the anti-federal party, fearing
that Queensland will join now, and thus spoil
a useful anti-Bill argument, proposed to assure
that province that there is no reason why it
should come in now—no reason at all; that
N.S.W. will wait for it, no matter how long,
and the other provinces will wait for N.S.W.,
and, therefore, all Australia will wait till
Queensland is ready; that it won’t gain any-
thing by federating now, nor lose anything by
indefinite delay, and that it may as well delay
as not. And, having first stipulated that the
standing-out of Queensland will wreck the
whole movement, it sends its John Norton
and others to froth at Brisbane and persuade
Queensland to stand out—and wreck the move-
ment. Also, having stipulated that it is im-
possible for N.S.W. to accept the Federal
scheme if Queensland doesn’t do likewise, the
Sydney anti-Federalists and their daily organ
yell incessantly that there isn’t a chance of
Queensland accepting—not the smallest possible
ghost of a chance; therefore, for the N.S.W.
electors to vote “Yes” is sheer waste of time
and energy, and they may as well save them-
selves the trouble —in short, that the Queens-
land proviso has damned the Bill utterly. The
proposed stipulation that N.S.W. can’t federate
without Queensland gives theanti-Billiouscrowd
two chances; it may persuade Queensland to
reject the Bill on the ground that there is no
hurry—Australia will wait till Queensland is
ready. And it may persuade N.S.W. to let it
go by default on -the ground that Queensland is
sure to reject it, anyhow.
A Woman in a Bath-tub.
A woman is stirred to remonstrate on a subject
of which she presumably knows something:—
Dear Bulletin.— About Dr. Brigham Brown’s remarks
on the unwashedness of women, I want to say that,
though I am a mere woman, I have a great regard for
cleanliness. I may have a natural dislike for the use of
water, but you must remember that, in common with
many other women, I come of a line of “ tubbers,” and I
have an acquired or inherited liking for water. All the
women I know are exquisitely clean. Not clean in the
ordinary way of a man who stands under a shower for one
rninule and hurriedly gets out and scrubs himself with a
towel. My women are cleah in a more elaborate and
dainty fashion ; they have marvellous loofahs, brushes,
and great yellow sponges. Most women of my acquaint-
ance take Turkish baths regularly, and swimming baths
also ; one woman whom I know rises at 5 every morning
and goes to a swimming bath with her husband.
In passing, let me say that Bananaland girls don’t bathe
half as much as Victorian girls, nor do they wash them-
selves as often. Another fact: all the women I know
take cold baths during the winter, whereas several of my
men-friends either go without or take warm baths. Also
I think the Australienne in her heart very irreligious,
though she may assume a virtue she has not. No woman
ever tounded a religion. Man goes and gets religions re-
vealed unto him, and then he shows em to woman, and,
if she follow 'em, nine times out of ten it is for the sake
of the man, not the religion. On another of Dr.
Brown’s assertions : Most women don’t regard them-
selves as the female of a vegetable John. Even in a
healthy woman, sexuality isn’t always on top. John
may be a man, but we don’t regard him as
such. To us he is simply a purveyor of vegetables.
We don’t regard him as our animal equal. He’s not a
very fetching animal anyway. Also, which is best,
licentiousness or temperance in all things? I think most
women are temperamentally more moral than men. I ve
known women of all classes and kinds, and I’ve met two
exceptions. Messadina was a fool to these. It s just
this way; if moral women were not in a majority the
bottom would drop out of our civilization. I don t say it
would beanyloss. Ourmoralitymay beacquired or innate,
but it’s all there. Of course, if Brigham Brown reasons
from a narrow Australian experience he may make out
some kind of a case in the matter of the vegetable John.
In Australia some women do marry John. And very few
men marry Miss John. The sufficient reason is that Miss
John isn’t here. But go among the islands, or to the
Southern States of America, or to Asia, and you will find
six men more or less married to colored women for one
woman more or less wedded to colored men. If Brown,
M.D., will get out of his local rut and look at the experi-
ence of countries where man has a chance to show his
craving after the brown and black and yellow daughters
of the land, he will perhaps learn something that will
surprise him. Even in a healthy woman, as I said,
sexuality isn’t always on top. Most of the sex-problem
novels, and practically all the sex-problem plays, are
written by men. Nearly every book in this world which
verges on the indecent is written by a man. Ninety per
cent, of the recorded offences against decency are done
by men. If you ask any doctor in charge of a large
hospital as to the condition of his patients on arrival, he
will tell you that five-sixths of the worse offenders against
cleanliness are men. Man has been insisting for a long
time on woman going under the shower —because he
wants to teach her to wash in the same perfunctory
fashion as he does himself. —Yiva Decadent.
The Suffield Case.
Following is a statement of the amounts col-
lected by The Bulletin on behalf of Thomas
Suffield, sentenced by Judge Windeyer to
ten years’ penal servitude on Bth April, 1891,
after a mockery of a trial, and in circumstances
which caused the greatest doubt of his guilt,
on the charge of assaulting a woman, he
being convicted by the uncorroborated and self-
contradicted evidence of one witness —the
woman herself.

The balance remains available to further his

The dirge of Brisbane Telegraph :
Yesterday- a first meeting was held of persons who in-
tend to form a league for the defence of Southern Queens-
land against the threatened invasion and ruin of all our
industries and commerce by the scheme of Federation
proposed by Melbourne politicians. If numbers and
warmth of feeling foretell events, this league will open
the eyes of persons who are trying secretly- and corruptly
to hand this country over to her destroyers. The next
step, it was resolved, should be to summon by circular a
large number of manufacturers, merchants, mechanics,
and others to a meeting at which the movement will be
thoroughly organised, with a view- of distributing infor-
mation through all the chief centres of population, so that
the electors may understand how great is the danger
hanging over them, arid that the referendum may meet
its deserved fate. The names handed in were those of
our best-known public men, and the publication of some
of them, which will take place in a few days, may cause
a little surprise. Plenty of money was at once promised,
so that the sinews of war are ready. A paid secretary
will bp appointed at once, and other paid officers, if
necessary, to make a thorough canvass and otherwise
carry out the purposes of the league.
If Queensland’s “ best known public men” are
in the anti-Billious camp, that camp will smell
like the Khalifa’s city of Omdurman before it
was disinfected. Queensland’s best-known
public men were mostly among the overdrafters
at the old Q.N. Bank, and the fragrance of
that institution can still be noticed as far
south as Launceston when a north -wind blows.
At a Yic. Court, the other day, a young fellow
pleaded guilty to a charge of “ improper rela-
tions ” with a damsel somewhat under the age
(16 years) of consent. The amorous pair were
anxious to stop the case by getting married, but
the girl’s mother refused her consent, and the
offender was duly committed for trial at next
Criminal Sessions. The protesting parent, in
cross-examination, admitted that she was her-
self living with a colored person (Argus re-
port), so it may be that she has conscientious
objections to any lawful union of the sexes.
Which suggests the necessity for a Court of
Matrimonial Advice to settle such questions as
arise in this case. Then the willing “victim”
could have the Court’s authority to get married
contrary to the wish of a mother who sets her
an example of free love with a blackman ?
During the first eight months of 1898 three
post-offices in the Austrian province of Dal-
matia (only three post-offices out of dozens)
cashed money-orders from Maoriland to the
amount of £ll,OOO. The money came from
Austrian gum-diggers. Not one in ten of the
Austrians was a permanent settler ; their ob-
ject in almost every case was to work their
hardest at gum-digging, to live on 4s. a week,
and to take their money back to their beloved
Dalmatia. On a low estimate they took
£lOO,OOO a year out of M.L. ; they paid prac-
tically no taxes ; they furnished the smallest
possible amount of employment; they made no
improvements in the country ; they were aliens
who couldn’t be called on to fight for it in case
of need ; and they deprived many Maorilanders
of work. As a rule, Australasia has a welcome
for every clean white man who means to settle
in the country, but the mere transient exploiter
calls for rigid exclusion.
When does the N.S.W. Government propose
to wake up and do something decisive to the
registry-office swindle —which is, at present,
about the most heartless fraud in the province 1
A multitude of the billets which the registry-
end puts on his list, and which he pretends
are in his hands exclusively, are simply copied
out of the paper of that morning, or yesterday,
or the previous week. Said fiend charges as
much as he thinks the hungry applicant can
pay (ss. is generally about the lowest figure),
and then sends him to find the place is
long since filled, or that he is only one
among perhaps 100 applicants. Also, he
doesn’t in the least mind sending half-a-dozen
applicants to look after one billet and charging
them ss. or more apiece. Sometimes his alleged
job is absolutely bogus, and never even existed
in the daily paper. If he really finds a job for
an applicant lie takes the largest part or the
whole of the first week’s wage for his fee.
Occasionally he is in league with the employer,
and they divide the fee, and t he employer regu-
larly sacks the new client at the end of a fort-
night, so that he and the registry-office ruffian'
can have another fee to divide. What the case
calls for is a rigid licensing system —any
unlicensed person in the trade to be fined
a large amount; moderate fees to be fixed by
law ; the registry-man to be bound to find his
client a billet inside a month or return the
money ; and any registry-man found trading in
bogus billets, or in billets that haven’t been
specifically put in his hands, to be gaoled or
fined copiously and lose his license. The Bul-
letin implores the members of N.S.W. Par-
liament not to all bring in the required Bill
at once, lest it lead to confusion. One Bill
is all that is wanted.
;
Though the N.S.W. Council professed to be so
much exercised about the smallness of the vote
at last Federal referendum, not one M.L.C.
proposed to remedy the evil by making voting
compulsory at next referendum. Seeing that
the great alleged grievance was that 138,000
votes were not a proper test of the popular
feeling, compulsory voting was the best way
to get a proper test —if the Council really
wanted it. And, as theHEYDON crowd declares
that the 160,000 who didn’t vote were against
the Bill, the shortest way to prove the push’s
sincerity—if it has any—is to make these
160,000 roll up next time, and thus squash the
Bill for good and all. Pity the N.S. W. Assem-
bly didn’t oiler to accept the Council’s 80,000
minimum with the added proviso that every
elector who was in the country, and at liberty,
and in good enough health to reach the poll,
must vote, or be fined 40s.
Carruthers (he’s cocky !) went one better than
the unrisen Lazaruses of N.S. W. Leg. Council
in the Federal conference. “ Put-off the poll
for three months,” said the men in the shrouds,
“ so that everybody may have a chance to con-
sider and vote.” “By all means,” said Cocky,
“ and we’ll let the poll extend over two or three
days, so that everybody will have a chance to
vote—and there’ll be no distance-disfranchise-
ment of the out-back selector with 40 miles to
ride, while the Sydney-anti rolls up to record
his protest next-floor to home.” And, as that
wasn’t in the least what Lazarus wanted—
Lazarus wept.
Melbourne is a beautifully civilised city in
some respects. For instance, there is no hos-
pital set apart for specially-infectious diseases,
such as diphtheria. The ordinary hospitals
object to take them, as it would spread infec-
tion among the other patients. Private hospi-
tals are not allowed to take them, and hotels
and boarding-houses cast them out lest the
fear of infection should drive away other
boarders and destroy the business. A lady
residing with her child in a Fitzroy board-
ing-house was nearly being ejected into the
street recently because the child was taken
ill with what appeared to be diphtheria,
and for a while it looked as if they would have
to get themselves run in for vagrancy, for there
was no demand for the small patient anywhere.
At last the proprietress of a private hospital
admitted them in a perfectly illegal fashion,
and as the ease proved not to be diphtheria,
after all, the Board of Health has decided not
to prosecute the hospital woman and have her
severely punished. Which is really very kind
of the Board.
Despite all dicta to the contrary, Queensland,
on the whole, seems to be decidedly in favor of
Federation. Brisbane, the octopus, is certainly
not enthusiastic. Jealousy concerning her com-
mercial interests is at the bottom of her apathy.
Neither is Toowoomba ardently federal in her
views—out of fear of the competition of N.S.W.
cabbages and potatoes. Rockhampton objects
strongly to the 123rd clause of the Constitution
—but the rest of Centralia doesn’t care a hang
about that. The North (Charters Towers in par-
ticular) is decidedly in favor of saying good-bye
to provincialism, while the sugar-districts (de-
spite the black-labor question) want to unite
with the provinces that will supply them with
a market. Southern Queensland, with the ex-
ception of two cities above-mentioned, is feder-
ally inclined, but lazy in the matter. When
the question is seriously taken up by Banana-
land Parliament there’ll be such a confounding
of the old party lines and platforms as Queens-
land has not experienced since the coalition.
Dear Bulletin. —In the matter of the Asiatic
alien, the white working-man is the true delin-
quent. He abuses Asiatics with his tongue,
but at same time upholds them with both hands.
Arrived at this conclusion while swagging it
on W.A. goldfields. At Peak Hill, found all
the carrying done by white men’s teams, but
heard it rumored that the Afghans had threat-
ened the storekeepers that if they did not give
them (the Afghans) six months’ loading, they
would open a store and sell at cost price ; and
I found the generality of the miners highly
pleased at the prospect of thus saving a shilling
or tw r o per week and ruining the white store-
keeper, teamsters, and all dependent trades.
At Lake Way it sticks out again. One store-
keeper employed camel teams ; another did not
believe in giving the Afghan a footing, and
employed the white’s teams. Storekeeper No.
1 was able to sell a penny or two cheaper than
No. 2. So the miners bought from former,
forcing No. 2 to employ the camel trains or
“go broke.” Yet these very miners will skite
about the great wrong Govt, is doing in allow-
ing the Asiatic into the country ; and are ready
to call every sort of dog to the man who put a
starving Chow on for a week’s work.— Swaggie.

Sydney Lyceum was re-opened by Charles
Holloway last Saturday—at least, it was presum-
ably the same old Lyceum, though, barring the
name and address, everything was different. The
house has been boiled and starched, and ironed
and filtered, also painted, papered, varnished, re-
carpeted and disinfected, and the germs have been
picked up separately, and placed on a flat board,
and then smashed with a club in the presence of
reliable witnesses. The accumulated grease-mark
of ages has gone from the gallery-wall, and the
accursed pea-nut man has been driven from the
front door. Also, the curtain with the picture of
the thin groveller urging the girl in the short
frock to buy somebody’s bile boots has vanished,
and in general the Lyceum is now the newest and
freshest theatre in Sydney, and all clean people are
cordially invited to attend.

As for the new drama, the Lord only
knows what it is about. It happened in the year
6s. Bd., and the scene is laid in the country where
long beers roll uphill. The “ Guardian Angel ”
herself is a ridiculous brown woman who says, at
least 40 times, that the English are the guardians
of freedom, and that before the noble English flag all
wrong and injustice back down in shame and hide
their diminished head in the ash-hole. She is her-
self the slave of an Englishman, and her boy has
been stolen by an Englishman, and the same in-
dividual, aided by another Englishman, com-
mitted a horrid murder before the story opened,
and got her beloved brown husband gaoled for
life by swearing that he did it. And this astound-
ing brown lady shakes a carving-knife in the air
and says that the English are just and noble, &c.,
and does other ridiculous elocution in the year 6s.
8d: and the land of long beers rolling uphill.
Later on, she is kidnapped on an English ship,
where the English captain and his British accom-
plice flog her brown son to death, and the English
crew looks on and refuses to interfere. And
when the brown son is quite dead, the distracted
mother covers him with the English flag, and says
that the English have noble hearts and will see all
her wrongs righted ; only just then they find that
the English captain and his English accomplice
have scuttled the ship and left them to drown.
There are more shouts about the justice and
humanity and glory of England in the “ Guardian
Angel ” than in any other six dramas of recent
date—mostly on the part of the demented brown
woman. An Englishman attempts to steal the pro-
perty later on, and tries to burn out the hero’s
eyes, and kidnaps the heroine, and stuns a small girl
in a white frock, and proceeds to drive a reaping-
machine over her with a view to cutting off her
feet, or her head, or something. And the awful
brown character lets her hair down to the bitter
end, and goes on something dreadful about how
the noble English heart can always be relied upon.
* * * *
The reaping machine seems to fix the
date of the drama in quite recent times, and the
coffee-colored slave appears to throw it back into
last century. Also, an allusion to Surinam sug-
gests that the scene starts in the Dutch West
Indies, only the English magistrate and the vast
number of British sailors, and the constant cheer-
ing for the Hinglish Flag upset this idea again.
Anyhow it is a very gorgeous and picturesque drama
with leagues of red sunset and blue sea in it, and a
most realistic steamer which picks up the principal
demented characters after the English captain has
murdered the small boy and scuttled the ship.
The brown woman is nearly lost, but she comes up
with her mouth full of sea-weed and tries to say
something about the humanity of the English
soul. William Gourlay—as a boneless China-
man of remarkable dancing capacities—is the
most unusual person in the co. ; and when
this Mongol dances he deserves to rank
alongside Lauri’s Chinaman Wun, of the
“ Geisha.” The brown lady of Miss Ida Gresham
is excellent most of the time; Amy Gourlay’s
g’rl Sarah is good all the time; and Ada Guil-
rd is the nice, ordinary heroine who always
means nice, clean clothes and looks as if her head
was washed regularly. Inman’s hero is exactly
like all Inman’s heroes. As for Stanford, he is
caked so thickly with villainy that the outer crust
would have to be scraped off with a knife to find
out what sort of person is underneath.
#* * *
A large crowd gathered at Sydney Royal
on Monday night to see “Madame Sans-Gene”
and the new Brough comedy co. It was a rather
silent crowd for its size, and applauded little, and
laughed seldom—in fact, it seemed to take the
tale of the violent waslier-duchess in a decidedly
serious spirit. Its principal smile occurred four
times. Two of the occasions were when the wash-
duchess made emphatic allusions to ladies’ under-
clothing—more particularly on the occasion when
she declared that Napoleon’s sisters hadn’t any.
Presumably, therefore, they went about attired
only in a frock and a pair of boots. Also, it looked
really interested when the duchess was pulled
up short just as she was about to tell a story about
how a sweep had stolen her diamonds, and she
had the wretched man of soot undressed till he was
a sweep in the altogether with a view to shaking
the gems out of his clothes —only this tale was
sawn off short, and the interest was lost. And
when the Emperor smacked the duchess two
severe, friendly smacks on a great area of fashion-
able bare back, and made her wriggle with the
suddenness of it, the crowd showed decided traces
of animation—only it got a view of the lady’s
shoulders a moment later, and was disappointed to
find no red marks thereon. It was evidently looking
for a plot of some kind, and there was none—or very
little. “ Madame Sans-G6ne ” is mainly a series
of scattered incidents in the life of a wash-lady
who attains to high rank, and wears her pink
petticoat in the drawing-roam, and gets into and
out of some expensive clothes in public, and
stands on the tail of her stately robe, and wears
her hat over her ear, and will persist in making
loud and furious allusions to the scarcity of linen
from which the Emperor’s sisters suffered in their
younger days.
m m m m
Brough, as the Emperor, can hardly be
taken seriously. He was so distinctly himself that
this paper kept thinking of him as Napoleon
Broughaparte. His face doesn’t make up for the
countenance of the pallid Conqueror with the
Forelock, and his voice wants to be painted and
decorated to make it sound like that of a man
accustomed to command. He seemed peevish and
sour rather than strong —a hot, cross Emperor who
knocked small articles about in his anger, where a
more imposing man would have attacked the big
furniture. The company consists mostly of new
people, and some of these new people were pain-
fully inaudible in the big theatre. One of them
might almost as well have left his remarks behind
him in writing and gone fishing. Judging by
a first inspection amid their new surroundings,
W. H. Rotherham, who played Fouehe, made the
best impression—a long, lank retiring impression,
but a good one all the same ; and Joseph Carne’s
Lefebvre had also sundry good points. Mrs.
Brough was a tempestuous washer - duchess,
and her stormy allusions to underclothing were
relieved a good deal by the manner of their
delivery yet even she fitted her part none
too well. At time of writing The Bulletin
hadn’t made up its alleged mind as to the prospects
of “Madame Sans-Gene,” but it had severe
doubts concealed under its shirt-front. Perhaps
if the miscellaneous ladies of Broughaparte’s
court were a little more dazzling in their beauty
the play would have a better show. And there
was still a lingering fragrance of bright new paint
about the Royal on Monday night. Bright new
paint gets on this paper’s digestion.
*# * *
G. Rignold’s “ Othello ” has taken a strong
hold upon Sydney. It is, without question, the
greatest Shakespearian production for many years
past, and it has raised Rignoid many miles in the
estimation of a community which knew him
chiefly as a hero of much “ melodrammer ” and as
the monarch who clattered in copious hardware
through the rather meaningless pageant of
“Henry Y.” That monarch is mostly a series
of processions and detached episodes, and a great
enterprise in ironmongery ; and he never amounted
to very much save in a spectacular sense. After
seeing what splendid work G.R. can do in perhaps
the greatest and most tragic of Shakespeare’s
characters, to go back to Henry V. would be
bathos. Apropos of which, one Shakespearian
character that Sydney would like to see its Rig-
noid do over again is Nicholas Bottom. A few
years ago he staged the “ Midsummer Night’s
Dream ” in a casual sort of fashion to fill a gap in
his arrangements ; and in a perfectly casual way
he gave a rendering of Nicholas, the weaver,
which any intelligent community would be glad to
see over again. This isn’t a specially intelligent
community, but at least it tries to look like one.

Fitzgerald's valued circus is doing great
things at Redfern, adjacent to the Benevolent
Asylum and the old cemetery. The horse-riding
tiger and the biking elephant with the lion on top
of him are probably responsible for one-half of the
boom, and the general excellence of the show
which is engineered by brother Thomas and
brother Dan’l will account for the rest. Rickards
is running a good programme at the Tivoli, but
it isn’t so strikingly unlike some previous pro-
grammes that the difference calls for diffuse com-
ment, and any variation which exists will hold
over comfortably till next week.
** * *
Miss Pattie Browne, who is going to pack
her numerous properties in her bag, 'and shut it
forcibly, and hie away once more to London, is to
have a benefit at Her Majesty’s (Sydney) on
Friday (7th April), when as many people as can
get into the programme will lend their assistance.
As for the people who wanted to get into the pro-
gramme but were crowded out, they will gnash
their teeth outside in the cold. Other news from
H.M.’s is that the “Geisha,” now near the end of
its eighth week, hangs out there as usual. Long
may it hang.
** * *
“Round the World in Eighty Days ” has
lived into its second week at Sydney Opera House,
but when the holiday season is over the old-estab-
lished curse of the premises will probably get
into working order again, and pull down fat
Charles Maurice’s venture. At present the curse
is laid up for alterations and repairs, or is away
having a rest. Relative to the show and the com-
pany, there is no call to add anything to the gloom
which was published last week. As regards the
most-advertised lady of the cast, she is—well, she
is, and the matter is charitably dropped there.
The rest of the company are also, most of them at
least; they are the same thing that the lady is.
Dante will reach his 101st and final performance
at the Palace on Saturday, and Sydney parts from
the cherubic young woman with regret.

Truly, nothing ever seems to become quite
dead in this world. If any ordinary man were
asked to name, off-hand, the deadest piece of
literature on earth, he would probably suggest
that ancient snake and beer-pot horror, “Ten
Nights in a Bar-Room.” And yet, just by way of
something light and reviving for the festival of St.
Bun, the old tale of tanglefoot was staged at
Sydney Royal Standard, and no one fired a well-
earned pewter at it and laid it out.
## * *
“ Woman and Wine,” the new melodrama
at Melb. Royal, seems to be the most distempered
box of tricks that Bland Holt has ever put upon
the market. It starts in England without a
visible motive, and deviates into a misunder-
standing between Walter Baker and Miss Ross,
after which it rushes away to Paris and revels in
spectacular lunacy for two hours and a quarter.
Miss Watson, as the oft-told female with a
“marble heart,” stands in the centre of the pro-
ceedings and invites reprisals. She completes the
ruin of her infatuated Baker by persuading a de-
spondent jockey to slip from the saddle of Baker’s
gee-gee after he has cleared the last jump, and when
the jockey flies to her for protection from the mob,
she snorts defiance at him and he is seen no more.
Also, the red-haired siren flaunts her callousness
in the chalked face of Baker, and expresses cold
contempt for a stout johnnie (who is either a
French duke or a British attorney, The Bulletin
can’t say which), and trifles with the sinful affec-
tions of Albert Norman in the presence of his
other girl. A hunchbacked Caliban hovers around
these various indignant dupes, advising them
not to put up with any more of Miss Watson’s
scorn, and the result is an all-round effort
to get her murdered by Baker. Somebody
pours 15 drops of essence of homicide into
Baker’s liquor, but the dose is too strong,
and just when he ought to be choking the en-
chantress Baker falls asleep across a basket at the
flower market. So Miss Fitzmaurice Gill, as the
other girl, comes along in the early morning and
Miss Watson comes after her, and the two ladies
jab at one another with knives which good old
Caliban has carefully sharpened on a grindstone.
It is a long, monotonous duel, and Miss Giil wins.
Then Miss Watson’s body is buried in a box of
roses, where it is duly discovered by Miss Ross,
who is now a Parisian flower-girl and the sole
support of Baker’s blind father. Therefore, Baker
is tried for murder in the last act, but the moment
he is found guilty Miss Gill arrives in court,
brandishing the knife that did the deed, where-
upon the convicted prisoner hops out of dock, and
the curtain falls hastily.
* * * •
The one pleasing character in this comedy
of horrors is Caliban (Arthur Styan), who puts a
keen edge upon the knives, and shoves the corpse
into the box, and chuckles joyfully over the hope
that the wrong person will be guillotined for the
crime. None of the others are at all interesting,
or humorous. The “ comic relief,” by Bland Holt
in an Eton jacket, Charles Brown, and Mrs. Holt,
is very thin and utterly irrelevant to the plot.
Also the plot, which is mostly a collection of
worn-out situations from other melodramas, has
the peculiar demerit of leaving the British hero
stone-broke in a foreign country, with a blind
father and a lackadaisical flower girl on his
hands. Miss Watson is dead, Miss Gill expects
to be found guilty and recommended to mercy,
Styan and Albert Norman are in custody as
accessories before the fact, the jockey has disap-
peared for good, and nobody troubles to wonder
what became of the stout johnnie who was either
a duke or a solicitor. As for the staging of
“Woman and Wine,” it is exceptionally good.
Some of Brunton’s backgrounds are delightful;
the steeplechase is worthy of Blandolt traditions ;
the bustling cafe scene and the ballet in the third
act would make the fortune of a better drama.
But they are not likely to make this drama’s
fortune.

The Alexandra, which opened with mild
enthusiasm on Saturday, and drew a substantial
audience, at prices ranging from a tanner to two
bob, is likely to smell less mildewed next Satur-
day, when the odors of bygone desolation will have
had a chance to get wanned off the premises.
“The Life and Death of Jack Sheppard ” is the
Alexandra programme for next Saturday, and re-
cognised members of the burglary profession will
be admitted free on production of their cards.
Meanwhile the co., headed by ’Gustus Glover, is
producing “Lost in London” on a scale of tre-
mendous pathos. Miss Elsie Lander is the lost
one. A wealthy mine-owner carries her off to
London along with her guilty conscience what
time Glover, her husband, is digging coal from a
bluestone quarry somewhere in the bowels of
Lancashire. A large neighbor, by the name of
Tiddy, comes down in a basket to break the news,
and Glover registers a solemn oath not to dig any
more coal for the bloated capitalist who has pur-
loined his wife, whereat the gallery rises like one
boy and cheers vociferously. The story of how
Glover shakes the coal-dust from his boots and gets
into the basket and finds his wife is not as
lively as one could wish, but it will serve to pave
the way for “ Jack Sheppard.”
** * *
The “ Belle of New York,” which brought
a reputation to Melbourne, and disappointed the
public badly on Saturday night, seems to offer
scope for brighter treatment than it gets from the
new company at the Princess’s. True, the scheme
of the entertainment is exceptionally puerile, but
the same objection in the case of Gaiety burlesque
was overcome by the personal influence of Fred
Leslie and his smart colleagues. Their success
depended entirely on themselves. The “ Belle of
New York” is a tuneful little farce, with an
avowed lunatic roaming at large amidst the
extravagance of it all. The lunatic is a casual, un-
necessary intruder, but seeing that he has plenty
of space to move about in, he might be a
warm favorite if he could sing and dance
like a Tom Wootwell. A versatile comedian
would earn popularity rather than ridicule
for the lunatic’s frequent intrusion. Oscar
Girard, the company’s leading funny man, is a
humorous actor of the dry, pessimistic type, who
sings and shakes his legs a little ; but several other
male items offer no particular excuse for having
arrived here on their present business. The young
hero is especially lacking in suitable stage accom-
plishments. Among the ladies, Miss Louise
Hepner plays the name-part sweetly, and is the
one artist in the crowd whose personality grips the
audience and gives life to the situation. She im-
parts a suspicion of sentimental interest to her
young man, notwithstanding his uncertain age.
Miss Belle Bucklin, as an orthodox Gay
Parisienne, is fairly satisfactory, and the various
human extras and spectacular effects are rather
less brilliant than was expected.
** * *
The police and warders of Melbourne, who
are running a stall at St. Vincent’s Hospital Fair,
gauge the popular taste with much accuracy by
having as a side-show a working model of the gai
lows at Melb. Gaol. The erection of the blithe-
some timbers was carried out personally by the
Official Scragger, and every detail, not forgetting
the dull sickening thud, is faithfully reproduced
Large crowds paid their thruppenies on the °P.® n '
ing night to see the “ turning-off ” of the white-
masked doll which wriggles on the end of the rope,
and as Melb. produced 8000 who visited the
morgue to see “ the head ” of Mabel Ambrose, and
picnicked on the lawn there, it is expected that
several bushels of “tray-bits ” will be the resultant
of the present cheerful show.
** * *
The Age and Argus critics of the Firm’s
Melbourne productions seem to base their opinions
on the ‘ ‘ enthusiasm ” or otherwise of the first-night
audience. “The Geisha ” was ridiculously over-
praised in the press because it met with a “ great
demonstration of approval from a delighted
house,” or words to that effect. That is to say,
the loudly-applauding minority had things all
their own way on “ The Geisha’s ” first night, and
the newspapers published notices to match the
opera’s reception. “ The Belle of New York ” was
somewhat “guyed” last Saturday, therefore the
Age and Argus found no transcendant merit in
the show. The one said: “With whimsicalities
of this flavor a hit is scored now and again, but,
frankly, we think it problematical how far they
can be relied on to divert Australian audiences.”
And the other said, “The Belle of New York,
though in no sense a ‘frost,’ has at best scored
only an equivocal success, and it now remains to
be seen whether judicious alterations will serve,”
&c., &c., &c. This is not criticism, but mere
apology for a non-“triumph.” Intelligent people
comparing these notices with the nauseating
praise given to “ The Geisha,” will be disposed to
ask whether any part of the new show can be more
peurile than the tail end of the Jappy-Jap-Jappy
opera where Miss Perry comes along in the thin
disguise of a fortune-teller.

Lieut. Travis and Horace Wheatley turned
up at Melb. Bijou on Saturday. Peggy Pryde
and other people introduced new items, and the
Rickards show had every appearance of being all
right for Easter.

Miss Amy Castles, the very young lady
who lately hurled her big soprano voice at the
Austral Salonites with encouraging results, is to
make a first public appearance in Melb. Town
Hall next Saturday night. Wallace Brownlow
and W. G. Barker will hkewise contribute warbles
to the programme, but the main question for con-
sideration will be the effect of Miss Amy’s top-
note upon an audience that has been told to pre-
pare itself for paralysis.
Colonel R. D’Orsay Ogden, an American ex-military
actor of 22 years’ standing in Australia, is to have a
matinee benefit on influential principles at Sydney
Criterion next Thursday (April 13). The Bulletin’s cor-
dial invitation to the public to roll up and give the fine
old gentleman a good send-off on his retirement from a
thankless profession, will be expressed at greater length
next week.
M ary Weir, the danseuse, about to star in the law-
court, first appeared, at. 6 years old, as central figure of a
hornpipe introduced into G. B. W. Lewis’s juvenile
“Pinafore,” at old Melb. Academy of Music. Flora
Graupner, Violet Varley and May Pollard all debutted in
the same performance.
Herr Friedenthal, a well-known German pianist, now at
Perth, W.A., fs the latest important musician to visit
Australia. Messrs. Nicholson and Co., his agents,
announce his appearance in Melbourne in the middle of
April, and in Sydney some time in May. Chopin is the
new pianist’s specialty. He is a man nearing 40, so that
the maturity we seldom find in our visiting stars—who
are always overblown or underdone—should be a valuable
quality in his interpretations. He plays a Bechstein piano,
and, according to a memoir by one Carl Yhering, is a
scientific man and a great traveller, with a solid Con-
tinental reputation.
Harry Rickards has bought his gold-mine, the Sydney
Tivoli theatre and hotel.
Mr. Crowley, proprietor of Bendigo’s only theatre, died
the other day. He was father of Dr. Crowley, the medico
around whom the Melb. Women’s Hospital squabble
raged, and was a keen business man who always favored
five-act plays on account of the bars of the adjoining pub.
—also his. * Two of his sons are medicos, Neil, the subject
of the row, being one of the few men posessed of a B.A.
degree in addition to his medical one. He is a clean-
shaven, smiling-visaged, powerfully-built young-fellow,
and makes athletic enthusiasts weep tears of blood at a
great pro. lost to the world.
Archbishop Murphy (R.C.), of Hobart, who never goes
out after dark, and hadn’t been at a public entertainment
for years, went to see Fitzgeralds’ Circus.
At Broken Hill, the other night, during the opening
performance of a “Jack and the Beanstalk” pantomine
(Broken Hill’s first panto., by the way) a stalls patron was
accompanied by a bull terrier. The appearance of Jack’s
“cow” was received by the dog with growls of disap-
proval, and when the animal came forward and friskily
began to “bunt,” the little animal could stand no more.
Bounding on to the stage it attacked the legs of the
“cow”; and the spectacle which followed of the fore-
quarters streaking for the prompt side and of the hind-
quarters and ribs struggling to a place of safety on the
O.P. side brought down the house.
“ Haresfoot” : Fewer actors have excelled as Othello,
than in any other great Shakespearian part, except, per-
haps, King Lear. Garrick, Kemble, Macready, Phelp-
Irving, the Booths, and manjr other good men, comparas
tively failed in it. The first outstanding Othello of the
English stage is Edmund Kean’s. Then there is a gap
till Brooke startled London. Another gap to Salvini’s
terrific performance, ending by a kick right over Shake-
speare's straps, when he cut his throat with his scimitar.
Edwin Forrest is reported to have almost equalled Brooke
in Othello. They were wonderfully alike.
G. Republican Dibbs says that over the
Want cable affair Premier Reid is “ telling half-a-
lie.” Well, the Tennysonian adage notwithstand-
ing, N.S.W. politics are improving. Once it was
“ You’re a liar 1 ” Now, “ You’re half a liar ! ”
A large proportion of the second edition
(2000 copies) of Will Ogilvie’s poems, published by
The Bulletin, were ordered in advance. Single

One of the most senseless things in Victoria is
the system of granting endowments to municipalities.
Up to a certain point, the thing is admirably worked out.
Cities and towns get 10s. on the £ of rates collected;
boroughs, 155.; first-class shires, 12s. 6d. ; second-class
ditto 245. ; third-class, 28s. ; fourth-class, 40s. ; fifth-
class’47s. 6d. ; sixth-class, 555. on the £. There are only
eight sixth-class shires—districts like Orbost, where there
are 2700 people to make and keep in order roads and
bridges over 4000 square miles of precipitous country—
and they certainly deserve their 555. on the £ endowment.
But—and this is where the humor of the situation comes
in—the endowment is only paid on the rates up to
Is. in the £. On any rates over that there is no endow-
ment. If a 6th class shire levies a rate of 2s. in the £ on
£20,000 worth of annual value, the first shilling produces
£3750 ; the second shilling only £lOOO. Therefore there
is very little inducement to make the rates more than Is.
in the £, whether the roads go to wreck or not—the
second shilling produces so little by comparison that no
one takes much interest in it. The obvious way to make
Vic. local government brace up and raise enough revenue
to meet its liabilities is to pay no endowment whatever on
the first Is. in the £ of rates, but to pay it on everything
over Is. The system wants turning upside-down.

The Mutual Life Association issues a report for
1898 which compares with that of some previous years as
follows
Total Added
Premiums. Interest. Income. to Funds.
1891 ..£154,198 ..£45,257 ..£199,455 ..£76,578
1892 .. 151,066 .. 50,194 .. 201,260 .. 73,366
1893 .. 146,762 .. 52,525 .. 199,287 .. 54,748
1894 ..141,994 .. 53,235 .. 195,229 .. 46,515
1895 .. 141,822 .. 53,543 .. 195,365 .. 38,782
1896 .. 143,138 .. 54,584 .. 197,722 .. 47,993
1897 .. 151,203 .. 57,373 .. 208,576 .. 54,433
1898 .. 158,118 .. 58,079 .. 216,197 .. 67,411
Taking everything into account 1898 has been a good
year with the Mutual Life Association. The premium
income has more than recovered from the drop it suffered
in the worst period of the depression ; the interest receipts,
despite the fall in the rate of interest, and the total in-
come are the largest in the Association’s record, and the
addition made to the funds is the largest since 1892.
The total funds are now £1,257,604, so the Mutual Life
Association ranks sixth among Australasian life offices,
the five which are ahead of it being the A.M.P., Maoriland
State Life Department, National Mutual, Colonial Mutual,
and Widows’ Fund, in that order. The assets look very
sound, the only objectionable feature being that “ pro-
perties acquired by foreclosure, £71,700,” is rather a large
item as against only £646,000 of mortgages. Apparently
one-tenth of the whole mortgages have had to be fore-
closed, which is above the average. Against this the
Mutual Life Association has one good feature which is
peculiarly its own. It writes off losses and depreciation
every year, and never lets bogus assets accumulate in its
balance-sheet. This year £6196 is written off, and in the
last six years the amount written off has been £57,402.
This policy of providing for losses as they arise is one that
other institutions would do well to follow.
The Mutual Life Association is making reserves
to enable it to reduce its estimates of future interest to
3J per cent.—another precaution which can’t be too much
commended. The present interest earnings are £4 14s.
lid. per cent per annum, so the reduction of the esti-
mite to £3 10s. will leave a good margin of security. The
one great trouble about the Mutual Life Association is its
heavy expense rate. This year it spent in expenses £l9
13s. per cent, of the total receipts, or £26 17s. per cent, of
premiums—a heavier ratio than that shown by the
A.M.P., Maoriland State Life Department, National
Mutual, Colonial Mutual, or the Citizens’ (ordinary
department), though it is distinctly better than
the very bad record just put up by the Widows’
Fund, and far ahead of such offices as the City
Mutual and Temperance and General. Still there
has been a great reduction since 1890, when the ex.’s
absorbed £33165. Bd. out of every £lOO of premiums, and,
as the improvement seems to keep going on, the Associa-
tion will probably become a reasonably cheap institution
some day.

N.S.W. Civil Service Co-operative Society re-
ports a profit of £4968 for the half-year to 31st Jan., 1899.
Some recent profits compare as follows :
January, 1896 .. £3273 January, 1898 .. £4250
July, 1896 .. 3275 July, 1898 .. 4456
January, 1897 .. 3785 January, 1899 .. 4968
July, 1897 .. 3962
A dividend of 10 per cent, per annum to shareholders
(£350) and a bonus of 10 per cent, on shareholders’ pur-
chases (£4253) leave a rather narrow margin of £365,
making the profit balance £394. The paid-up capital is
£6995, and the reserve-fund £11,500. Considering that
the Society, at date of balance-sheet, had only £365 cash
on hand, and the bank overdraft was £3325, it isn’t any
too clear where the div. and bonus are to come from, and
it looks as if the business was growing too large for the
capital.
• * * •
The Co-operative Wool and Produce Co.
(Sydney) closed its first year on 28th Feb., 1893, with a
profit balance of £1077. Out of this it decided to pay a 6
per cent, dividend on its then paid-up capital of £843,
and to distribute as much of the balance as the directors
thought fit in bonuses to constituents. Second year
ended on 28th Feb., 1899, with a profit balance of £5394,
but, as no profit-and-loss account is included in the balance-
sheet, it is impossible to say exactly how much of this is
the year’s profit and how much is the balance brought
forward from previous year, after paying the 6 per
cent. div. and the bonus that the board thought
fit. Probably it is quite safe to assume that £5OOO
is the current year’s earnings. At all events,
the second year’s profit is a vast increase on the
first one, and the business is extending greatly. Share-
holders get a 6 per cent, dividend and 15s. per cent,
bonus on the value of their produce sold ; and these,
according to the balance-sheet, amount to something un-
specified, which, when deducted from the £5394 available
profit, leaves a balance of something or other, or there-
abouts. From a daily paper report of the chairman’s
speech, however, it would seem that the co. distributes
£2198; puts £l5OO to a reserve-fund and carries forward
£1696.

The hopeless-looking N.S.W. Shale and Oil Co.
made a profit of £691 for the half-year to 31st Dec., 1898
(equal to about 1J per cent, per annum on capital), as
compared with £284 previous.half-year. Being in a reck-
less mood, it paid a div. at the rate of £24s. Sid. percent.
per annum (£833). The Shale and Oil 00., like the faded
lady who runs a hash-house, has seen better days. Six
years ago its profits averaged £20,000 a year. It feu badly
in ’94 (profits, £1142) ; flickered up again in 95, when
the profits reached over £ll,OOO, and finally fell into re-
jooced circumstances ” in ’96. Now it looks as if the final
closure was not far off.

During this period, the robust Barrier railway monopoly
has capitalised £32,968 of its profits ; has paid off, also out
of profits, £BO,OOO of debentures and other liabilities,
largely written down the book-value of its property,
bought new rolling-stock (out of profits), and otherwise
had a good time. If there is a nicer monopoly in Aus-
tralia than the Silverton railway, its address is not known
at this office.

Hobart Railway League, hitherto a pliant
friend to the Great-Western Gridiron Railway Grab, has
at last snapped at the hand of Chaffey Baker, and that
worthy syndicator naturally complains gently of the
league’s disloyalty. At last meeting of the league, chair-
man G. P. Fitzgerald forced a motion that enquiries
should be made, as to whether the syndicate, as reported,
was really asking Bull a million-and-a-quarter for its
Gridiron, this exorbitant reach-out being the cause of the
delay. This decision stirred things up, for, within a
few days, Agent-General Fysh wired from London :
“Great Western underwritten to £1,100,000 ; flotation
certain.”

B.H. Water Supply, whose reservoir area was

another stroke of luck/ Though as the result of the March-

ment, and there is reckoned to be two and a-half years’
sunnl y for Broken Hill now behind the dam.

The ex-manager of the S.A. cyanide-plant in
Oentralia (by the way, he is not identical with the Wool-
cock who formerly managed a Barrier claim) writes that,
though he spoke highly of the White Range claim, in the
M'Donnell Ranges, he did not say it was capable of run-
ning 60 head for five years. The papers said he did ; but,
then, it was part of a banquet-report.
* * * *
Apropos the departure for Chillagoe of Mr.
Stewart, general manager of the B.H. Prop., the lately-
imported assistant, who has been understudying for the
post, hasn’t dropped into Australian ways, and there is
occasional friction. One of the three big open-cut con-
tractors (all this work is contracted for) has thrown up
his section after having worked at it from the beginning
under general manager Howell; and in other directions
there are movements and mutterings which make those
who love peace feel uneasy.

B.H. Proprietary announces shilling divs. per
quarter instead of eightenpennies—a change which,
though not officially whispered, was pretty easily foretold
from the last accounts. The change is “ temporary,” of
course, like all mining div.-reductions. That is the ad-
vantage of having such delightfully vague words as
“ temporary ” in the language. If, however, the word
means just a half-year or two, the shareholder has by
this time probably begun to wonder why the reserve-fund
which was created to equalise divs. is not touched. It
stands at £125,000 now—and has stood there for two or
three years past, earning about £4OOO a year interest.
Obviously, however, it wasn’t built up simply to give 3£
per cent, to shareholders. The best way to account for
the fact that this div.-equalising reserve hasn’t been
broached is that, for all practical purposes, this isn’t likely
to be a temporary reduction at all; and the fact that the
reserve dates from about the strike-time suggests that
this wasn’t the sort of div.-equalising that was intended,
anyway.
B.H. Proprietary is still not wholly a sulphide
mine. Last half-year 203,000 tons of ore was handled ; of
this, 78,000 tons was sulphide and 125,000 tons oxidised
ores. The smelting plant treated 164,000 tons or its
equivalent; the chloridising and leaching plants 39,000
tons. By the concentration of the sulphides the volume
of the just-mentioned 164,000 tons was reduced to 101,000
tons prior to smelting. During this six months the co.
had a larger smelting capacity than ever it had before.
Yet as just said, it only smelted 101,000 tons. In the
corresponding half of 1894, when oxidised ores were
exclusively handled, and on a smaller furnace capacity,
287,000 tons were smelted. But this reduction in the
quantity of ore which it has been possible to smelt, not-
withstanding the gradual increase of furnace capacity,
has been so marked since they began to treat sulphides
that the figures are given here for each half-year
Half-year to N0v.,’94 .. 287,310 tons
„ ~ May,’9s .. 236,972 „
„ N0v.,’95 .. 171,742 „
” ” Mav,’96 .. 167,352 „

! „ N0v.,’97 .. 116,235 „
„ ~ May,’9B .. 104,393 „
” ” N0v.,’98 . 100,836 „
Clearly, then, the difficulties in the way of sulphide treat-
ment are not overcome by concentration, as too many
have supposed. The B.H. Proprietary is credited with
doing the best concentration on the Barrier ; yet the in-
troduction of only this comparatively small quantity of sul-
phide concentrates (less than 25,000 tons of the total 101,000
tons) has, with a somewhat less favorable mixture of
other ores, been sufficient to reduce the smelting capacity
per furnace so enormously. What would happen if,
through the too rapid extraction of the oxidised ores (of
which there are probably a million tons, or a little over,
exposed) a considerably larger proportion of the sulphide
material had to be introduced to the furnaces ? Even six-
penny divs. would have to be struggled for then. Yet it
is from the oxidised ores alone that large profits can be
got promptly. Shareholders will, in the circumstances,
probably accept the less of two evils, putting up with
the reduced dividends rather than using up merely as
ores that oxidised material which is becoming invaluable
for fluxing purposes. t *
Substance of a letter from Maoriland to Sydney
D.T. “Sir,—l have just seen a prospectus of a gold-
dredging co. on Turon River, N.S.W. I will give you an
idea how dredging co.s are floated here. An area of from
80 to 100 acres"is taken up along the banks of the river,
and when it has been prospected a prospectus is issued
with a capital of £5OOO or £6OOO in £1 shares. Vendors
take 1000 paid-up shares, and also 1500 contributing ; cost
of dredge, about £3500. Average returns from dredgers,
about 20oz. per week (with the exception of two or three
which got on some rich patches about Cromwell). This
leaves a profit of about £2O per week. The Turon co. has
a capital of £48,000, in £1 shares. Out of this ven-
dors take fully 24,000 fully-paid-up (no contributing),
and sell 6000 to public. Now, if vendors wish,
they can send up the price of these 6000 shares
to any value they like, and get out of their
own, making a fortune. Or, supposing the venture to
turn out a success, the vendors can sit down and smoke
their cigars, taking 16s. out of every £1 earned by the
money belonging to the public, and the few hundred
shareholders have the four shillings to divide among
them. What dq these vendors give for all this ?
Absolutely nothing but the ground they pegged out,
which may be worthless, for if there is any clay through
it it will be so. I think it would only be fair to the
public that these vendors’ shares should be held in trust
for six months after the dredge has been at work, and
there should be less of them. I have written this for the
benefit of those who may feel inclined to go into these
things without due consideration. —Puo Bono Pub-
lico." Which is a nice piece of oold iron for dredging-
promoters to chew.
The lucky Cobar tributors, who have now (say)
£200,000 a year to play with, are understood to be buying
right and left into all promising Oobar shows. Presently
they will practically own the whole field, and then (this is
an off-hand prophecy) hey for the (say) Great Cobar Con-
solidated Mining Corporation ; capital (say), three
millions.
* * * *
In consequence of the apparent initial success
of the Campbell Creek operations, there promises to be
a regular boom in Vic. dredging companies (and things
threaten to be ditto in N.S. W.). Everyone you meet has
a prospectus concealed about him, and the only defence
is to have a little “venture” of your own. As most of
these creeks have been turned over dozens of times by
fossickers and Chinamen, the public should be careful
before investing. The man who can find gold in a Chow’s
tailings deserves to.

“ Working Miner ”: Re par. of l'lth Feb., you
are in error in supposing that the 200 a. at Mt. Morgan,
acquired by Chief-Sec. Peacock, was not touched by
“ wild catters.” Fourteen years ago it was more-or-less
a “cat,” and comprised a portion of ground held by the
celebrated “ jumpers,” who were blocked by the exten-
sion of the M.M. northern boundary. Whilst prosecuting
their claim in the Privy Council, and prospecting for the
kaolin and ferruginous deposits peculiar in those days to
the mountain-top, they left the cap of a big mundic lode
in the bottom of a 100 ft. shaft, practically untouched. At
that time Mt. Morgan mundic ore was unknown. Any-
one doubting this statement can see for himself. The
thermal spring theory is “bust,” so far as Mt. Morgan is
concerned. The Linda lode is the main prop of the big
mine. It runs north and south. It now remains for Pea-
cock and co. to demonstrate whether the mundic lode
stops short (on the northern side) within the big co.’s
fence. It does not look as if it did. This is the true
history.

Beautiful item from Melbourne Age showing
how Vic. Mining Department strains the law in favor of
the big foreign speculator “ In the Maryborough news
published yesterday in the Age it was reported that the
Mines Department’had refused two applications of Mr. L.
F. Sachs for leases of 400 and 1500 acres in Dunolly dis-
trict. It was stated that on a number of leases already
held by Mr. Sachs a very small amount of work has been
done, pending the introduction of English capital, for
which negotiations are in progress. The Mines Depart-
ment explains that the two applications were refused be-
cause it is not consistent with the policy of the depart-
ment to allow large areas to be held by one company or
syndicate. In relation to the leases already held by Mr.
Sachs, the department has been satisfied that the enter-
prise is bond-fide, and that as a large amount of outside
capital will be brought in, the suspension of the labor
covenants was reasonable. At the same time, there has
not been much work done, and the Department desires to
see some material progress made on the leases already ac-
quired. The absence of such work on those leases was
another reason for declining to issue any new leases, for
the present at any rate, to the same proprietary.”
Which seems to mean just this: That Mr. L. F.
Sachs holds a large amount of gold-bearing land, and doesn’t
work it as provided by law, and prevents other people
working it, and thereby hinders a few dozens or hundreds
of Victorians finding employment. That the Vic. Mining
Department winks at this state of things. And that its
alleged reason for winking is that Mr. Sachs promises to
discourage Victorian enterprise by handing over these leases
to John Bull. Why can’t the miserable Vic. Mining
Department be honest; or if it must stretch the law in
somebody’s favor why not stretch it in favor of the local
man who will employ local capital and labor, and keep
the dividends in the country ? At present it seems to
spend most of its time locking up the auriferous land
against its own people for the benefit of the top-hatted
speculator who wants to float a shijidykit in England.
“Cuprite,” who possibly has his own little
Chillagoe axe to grind, protests against a statement that
the Q. Mining and Prospecting Co. is the second best spec,
on the Chillagoe field. Also, he states that the Johnston
who goes *Ome to boom the co. is not “ Revel” Johnston,
but plain Johnston, a colleague of Revel. Anyway, he
will revel if he gets British boodle into the spec.

Croydon items: Waratah Co., Bull-owned,
cleaned up, after six weeks experimental crushing,
2330 z. gold (£667) from 1670 tons treated. Ore
taken from quarries and not weighed : various
estimates as to quantity crushed, some authori-
ties making it 1800 tons. Manager estimates £4OO worth
of amalgam left on plates, but, as this is guess-work, it
may be passed over. Experiment a failure ; and people are
now wondering where Warden Towner got his figures
when he estimated this ore to be worth £2 9s. per ton,
and gladdened the heart of Bull. The Warden, on the
actual result from the stamps, was only a trifle over £2
per ton out in his estimate —which isn’t much for some
Wardens. This experiment was looked forward to with
much anxiety locally. Given proper management, it is
believed the Waratah Co.’s mines may be made to pay—
never as worked at present. Record yield of bullion was
got by Geo. Hourston at his Catherine mill, 389J0z. from
675 tons. Bullion worth £1 14s. 4Jd. per oz., which is the
record. Croydon Feb. returns about 6000 tons for about
30000 z., Waratah Co.’s low-grade ore having reduced the
average. There should have been much more in if all
the batteries cleaned up at the end of the month.
At latest, about 500 tons going through from No. 7 North
Golden Gate for an estimated 4oz. per ton. Other large
parcels being treated. Crushings : No. 5 South Golden

inevitable descent. No mine on earth has been luckier—
in location, climate, everything—nor easier to work. The
quality was there; what took looking after was the
quantity, and any man with a brain as big as a walnut
could get that out and through the mills without much
cogitation. Old Bischoff miners smiled when Ferd Kayser
is referred to as a “good manag'er.” Any good tin-
sluicer could have managed the Bischoff, with probably
less “ show ” than Kayser. He was for ever experiment-
ing ; every available space was crammed with trick-boxes;
every pint of water was saved to turn his little baby-
jiggers, and rock his little cradles. The more it rained,
the more he smiled, and the more his fakements roared
and rattled. But, lucky for him—lucky Bischoff again—
the tin rained, too. And the more it peppered through
the sheds, the more the shareholders clapped, and cried
“Oh ! good old Bischoff !—good old Kayser ! ” He could
afford to play gee-gee with such a mine as it was ; but
now—well, he has practically resigned.

“Hammer” to The Bulletin “Re Queen
Margaret mine, W.A., and the directors’ remarks as to
alleged gold-stealing. About two years ago a miner em-
ployed by the Q.M. Co. took lOOoz. odd to a smelter in
Kalgoorlie and casually remarked that the metal was
‘alluvial.’ Smelter at once saw it was ‘reef’ gold and
told the digger to take it elsewhere. Later on the co.
provided a changing house, other co.’s following suit.
Though stealing is still prevalent, the evil is somewhat
exaggerated, but, taking the fields as a whole, the aggre-
gate must be enormous. One of the worst features of
the well-nigh impossible task of catching the thief or
thieves red-handed is that sometimes right-down honest
fellows are suspected and lose their billets.”
And “Kink” sends this: —“A face-hand gob

Will someone start preaching about the folly of
clearing the timber off mining-fields without any attempt
at replanting ? There is hardly a metal-mining district
in the Australias that hasn’t its fuel-difficulty. The
Murchison (W.A.) was going to be an exception ; the
timber there was “ inexhaustible.” And yet here is
another, the Murchison King, added to the long list of
hung-up batteries—this one strictly on account of soarcity
of firewood. __
James Kell, of Parramatta, has started on
a hopeful trip to Glasgow. Kell understands that
his late father’s property, amounting to some
.£30,000, lies in the hands of trustees there, await-
ing a legal claimant.
Burgess, the man whom the Queensland
police tried so hard to hang over the matter of
the three dead Murphys at Gatton, has been fired
out of gaol in disgust, his sentence having expired.
He got two months on a bogus charge of vagrancy
to give the police time to grease the rope, and the
only compensation he receives for their mis-
take —so far as the public know —is the
curse which Perleeceman O’X threw at him
when he left the gaol. And yet any merely
human bobby has a natural grievance against
Burgess. If he had been the right man, then the
exhausted cop could have returned to the flesh-
pots and beer-pots of Brisbane with a light hearb
and a vindicated character. And by not being
the right man Burgess compels these cops to do
miles and miles of hard walking and riding, to
grovel with their heads in the dust looking for
“tracks,” and to seek for information among
resentful potato-growers who wouldn’t ask a
bobby if he had a mouth on him though his tongue
was hanging down to his lower waistcoat-button.

There was one very pathetic feature about
the track-side tragedy in the Wentworth district
lately—the tragedy of an old man and his wife
tramping for work and perishing together from
thirst. The old people had apparently all their
possessions with them, and it wasn’t a very big
sv ?®g then ; but it included the Family Bible
with the usual entries of births and deaths—all, so
tar as can be ascertained, that they had to show
for nearly 25 years of married life in N.S.W. If
here isn’t a Heaven there ought to be.

Another example to show how far present-
day “ religion ” is from present-day practice—even
m godly Melbourne. Said Mr. justice Hodges
explaining his charge to the jury in the Dungey-

testament reference referred to in the case, I did not
mean to tell them they were to violate the teachings of
the 1 aw° k ’ bUt merely to disregard them in administering

When the tactics of Melbourne magistrate
Fan ton re the legal proceedings against Dora
■Bromley were duly denounced by the prosecuting

Whereupon the lawyer added, “Well, whatever
you like to call it,” and the bluffing beak tried to
look lute a man who had asserted his dignity.
Ihe Bulletin is waiting to know what Mr.
Panton would like to call it.

When one strikes the Victorian law-courts
for the first time (writes an experienced newspaper
reporter to The Bulletin) and sees the Crown-
Irosecutors at work, a sense of vast wonderment
overtakes him that such men—one of them only is
excepted from this remark-should earn as much
as a municipal mud-shoveller. After a very short
experience of the courts, however, the feeling of
wonderment fades away, and underlying the ap-
pointment of such men to the position one sees
good sound reason. In no country should a
brovernment pay twice over for anything. It
is unnecessary to pay keen Crown-Prosecutors on
the floor of the court when there are such excel-
lent men doing 1 the work on the bench.

Gaol administration likes all criminals to
die admitting the justice of their doom, and so
on ; and if they won’t admit it words are dropped
which serve the public as a base for a consolatory
report. Blue Mountain Butler, according to gaol
report, fathered his crimes on drink. There is
plenty of reason for rejecting this as a pious tee-
total invention—Butler’s crimes were sober and of
infinite cold-blood. A high authority dropped
hints to the effect that Butler confessed to him
the perpetration of four murders. The number,
notvyithstanding, may have been less or more.
Louisa Collins was rumored in the same way to
have acknowledged herself an absolute Borgia,
but the public are now satisfied that her lips
stayed sealed as the Sphinx’s. Johns, executed
for attempted murder, was represented as peni-
tent, but the true record of his last utterances to
beseeching parsons was, “ You think you can save
my soul; why don’t some of you try to save my
body ? Deeming, another reputed contrite, died
a mixture of funk and bravado. The dying state
of Archer and others was similarly misrepre-
sented. Gaol warders and chaplains look on a
penitent death as the fitting result of their treat-
ment of a criminal, and self-interest and self-
conceit torture trifling words of the condemned
into repentance and confession. So Sunday-
school stories are built up. Few tales are more
unreliable than those which, on or about the day
of an execution, gaol chaplains and warders
whisper respecting the frame of mind in which a
condemned dies.

Queer fact that the recent sensational
Melbourne inquest should have brought Dr. Gaze
into trouble. Gaze practises at the house where
Coroner Youl lived and joked for 40 years, the
house that was in the first place a snug little cot-
tage confronting a paddock where cows foraged
f or .. tmficer, and is now a solemn three-storey
building at the toney end of Collins-street. One
doesn t need a very strong imagination to believe
that the spirit of jolly old Youl hovered around
the trial of Dr. Gaze, and urged the jury to give
his new medical friend the benefit of every doubt.

Lately a 17-months-old child died at Mt.
Gambier in great agony from tuberculosis.
Another child of the same family was then found
to have the disease. No hereditary taint being
discoverable, the family cow fell under suspicion ;
but her fine condition and healthy appearance were
standing evidence that she had been libelled. Yet,
examination, tuberculosis was found in
the udder ; and the microscope disclosed bacilli
111 milk. South Australia puts every tree
under an inspector’s eye in dread of some grub or
other ; but a diseased poley gets a chance to kill
a lot of people before she is turned into hide and
tallow.

For one thing Westralia may be praised.
It has an Early Closing Act that is being en-
forced. Shops in Perth, Fremantle, &e., may not
open before 8 a.m. or after 6 p.m., and on Wednes-
days there is a half-holiday. On Saturdays they
open till 10 p.m. From this chemists, news-
agents, fruiterers, hair-dressers and such are ex-
empt—but the Act applies strictly to the bulk of
retail shops. There has been a little trouble on
the margin of the Act, defining the operation of
exemption clauses. Otherwise the law works
smoothly, and is a benefit.
Re the Melb. Wes-
leyan attack on the

who reserved judgment.

A young Melb. civil servant applied to
Vic. Insolvency Court last week for the annul-
ment of an order directing him to pay .£3 per
month to his creditors. When he filed his
schedule (in ’96), he was “doing the heavy,” it
appeared, on £9 per month, and such incidental
items as 16 guineas for a dress-suit and 30s. for
lure of a carriage to take himself and lady to a
ball (probably Guv ment House ball) were charged
against him. At this distance of time, the insol-
vent deriding can’t remember whether the lady
aforesaid was young or old. He has been to so
many different balls that his recollections are
mixed, fourteen months elapsed between the
filing of his schedule and the issue of the order—
beastly, cwuel awwangement, doncherknow—to
pay £3 a month ; but seeing that he had already
paid £63 on the beastly ordah, the young man
thought it was time the Court gave him an uncon-
ditional certificate. Judge Molesworth took a
measure of compassion on the crippled swell.
The order was reduced to £2 a month, and insol-
vent made his own terms as to payment of five
guineas costs incurred by his pathetic application,
the terms being cash within the next three years.
Meantime he may be expected to achieve a
wealthy marriage as the reward for his social
enterprise and 16-guinea dress-suit.

Westralia is glad nowadays to get almost
anything in the shape of population, so General
oalvation Booth—he of the pawnbroker’s red nose
and the sunset jersey—has acquired 21,000 acres of
good coal, agriculture and timber land, with 17
miles frontage to Collie River, on which to plant
a colony of neglected youths and soiled doves and
other derelicts. If Booth lives it will probably be
the richest spot in Westralia by-and-bye. When

in the feet which characterises the agricultural
’groper doesn’t run in the Booth family. Even in
the General’s old age the fleetest sixpence in the
land with 100yds. start wouldn’t keep ahead of
him in a mile race.

Religion has had a lot to answer for lately.
The woman who drowned her handsome little son
at Port Melbourne by pressing him face down-
wards into a few inches of water is now getting
moments of crazy satisfaction from an idea that
the child “was to be exalted.” The mad baker
who slaughtered himself and family at York
(S.A.)_ was an ardent member of the York
Christian Church. At Easter-time a true Believer
chews his Lenten dogma cud : A t Easter-time his
morbid fancy darkly turns to thoughts of blud.
During recent examination-in-bankruptcy
of a Sydney doctor it appeared that he had sent
to London for sale a valuable collection of stamps,
representing the labor of eight or ten years,”
but had never received a penny of the proceeds,
which should have been about ,£BOO. The con-
signee, “a well-known stamp-collector,” has “dis-
appeared.” The Bulletin is prepared, any day,
to hear of one philatelist murdering another for
the sake of his collection.

A man with a new and reliable cure for
everything wrote some time since to the Yic.
Health Department :
. S' r > If any person that is ill of any incurable disease
likes to go a few days without all kinds of liquids and live
on dry bread and cabin biscuits, they can cure themselves
any disease the human system is liable to. The process
of this cure is the navel and kidney. It is a faithful cure.
Habitual inflammation and suppuration takes plane in
two or three days. The very worst kind of sore eyes are
cured in three days. Take care of broken bones during
this cure, if any, and keep warm. Warm weather is
favorable to the cure. Any weak or delicate person
should have half a pint of water every third day. I can
speak of this cure from personal experience. Luxuries
•V o*’ 0 *’ l a k en with this cure. I had rupture,
hydatids, stoppage of the bile, paralysis and tuberculous
consumption all cured with this cure. I went nine days
without water, not even washing myself, while under-
going this cure. At the end of that time I was cured.

Disgraceful scenes are reported to have
taken place at the Victoria Barracks, Sydney, last
Thursday. Most of the permanent men having
gone into encampment, the Barracks was practic-
ally handed over to the volunteers. On Thursday
night there was a scene of riot lasting from about
10 p.m. till 3 a.m. The men began to drink, and
went on to smashing windows and throwing things
into disorder ; as a result of the mix-up some had
to be taken off to hospital. There was talk of
turning the whole lot out afterwards, but things
were .smoothed over. Now the gates are closed at
10 p.m. both for ingress and egress. Great dis-
satisfaction is the outcome of the encampment of
the Australian Horse upon “ Constitution Hill,”
this Easter. “ Constitution Hill ” turns out to be
merely another name for Mount Rennie, the
locale of the main city dustheap.

Religious crankiness strikes a silly height

Police-magistrate King, who lately left
Australia for Norfolk Island will have some pecu-
liar laws to dispense among that mentally-feeble
community. A dog that chases goats is visited
with the death-penalty. If he is found breaking
an egg, he is summarily executed. If any person
kill a cat, that person’s dog is seized by law and
killed in return. Should the cat-killing person
have no dog, the magistrate must seek an
equivalent in some other direction. If a pig
be found running loose, the owner must
satisfy the court that the animal was sick at
the time, and was out for medical exercise,
or he forfeits the porker. And so on.
Magistrate King will feel himself re-
urning to the Jatck and the Beanstalk
state of mind.
Martha Adams, who lately
suicided by hanging in Norfolk Is-
land, is given rank as the first
suicide in Norfolk Island annals.
Jf the annals of the descendants
of the Bounty mutineers be meant,
the rating may pass, but Marti 1a
is not by hundreds the first suicide
of Norfolk Island. That hell of the
Pacific had its suicides by the score
on every judicial visitation from
Sydney. Scores without physical cou-
rage to kill themselyes vised ito kneel to
companions apd beg to have the knife
driven into them. Scarcely a cell of
the old prison but was credited with the
spectre of a self-murderer. _ Since the
penal establishment was abolished there,
the -island has probably been lying
asleep, resting from its prg.y ,of malig-
nant cruelty and despair, up til Martha
prods ft now with her toes in the air.
And it is worth noting that, as the first
suicide in Botany Bay was effected
by hanging, so, as soon as N.S. W. re-obtains
control of Norfolk Island, the first suicide is
again by hanging.

Time a royal commission, or something,
was appointed to inquire into the demoralising in-
fluence of a Sydney northeaster. During this
wind’s prevalence, the average citizen goes out iji
■the morning dressed in a clean shirt and a rigid
•morality. By lunch-time his collar is half-way
down his back and his integrity is out of plumb }
ere night he is a physical wreck, and utterly des-
titute of moral principle ; also, he is generally
‘half-drunk. Sydney can never be a moral city
until the northeaster is abolished, and unless the
N.S. W. provincialists will guarantee to do this,
The Bulletin will vote the establishment of the

There has been much talk about black-

couple beneath. A shouted warning brought a

The alleged double suicide of the Dacres
nas nearly faded from people’s minds. In method
and execution it was almost on all-fours with
the recent M‘Kain (M.L.) tragedy. In each
ease the man took the initiative. In each
case perverted passion was at the base of
the crime. In each case the husband
was the slayer of his wife. To find a
parallel with the Miller-Allardice
affair, one has to go to Bury,
England. On 28th Jan. last
two unknowns engaged a
room at the Derby Hotel,
and booked “ Muller and
Co.” The man of the
party enquired for a
chemist’s, and set
forth, accompan-
ied by the woman,
exquisitely dress-
ed, for the shop.
They returned,
and retired.

Seen by a Bulletin man, on the “ seven -

little girls walking placidly to school, neat and
tidy, and at peace with the world ; one carrying a
large bunch of yellow flowers. They pass a third
girl, of about eight, bathing her bare feet in the
gutter. No. 3 espies the flowers, and her face
lights up with sudden venom. She dashes at the
bearer, snatches the bouquet from her hand,
batters her about the face with it, scratches and
claws hair with animal ferocity, and then throws
the flowers into the gutter and jumps them into
the mud. “There’s fer yer dirty yaller !” she
screams after the weeping victim.

In many Sta,te-schools children
are taught hpw to act in case of snake-bite.
The directions officially supplied are, however,
ludicrously insufficient. The other day, a case
pf snake-bite at Roma was treated by depart-

bitten limb, left there for eight hours, until circula-
tion was completely arrested, and then the arm
had to be amputated at theshoulder !

From “The Banjo
Dear Bulletin. —l see that my recent article on the
Northern Territory has evoked a pathetic protest from a
correspondent, who says that I “ never met Paddy Cahill
and have wronged the N.T.”
This is a terrible state of things. It was bad enough
for me to wrong the N.T., but not to meet Cahill was
simply unpardonable. I can only plead that Cahill, on
the occasion of my visit, was away murdering buffaloes,
and I unfortunately missed him. It was my loss. I hear
by all accounts that, he is riot, only a crack buffalo-shooter,
but a very white man, and when I said that he hunted
buffaloes dressed in a towel and a diamond ring I did not
think he would take it much to heart. To save trouble I
withdraw the statement, and now assert most emphati-
cally that he always hunts buffaloes while dressed in a
frock coat, a pot hat, and patent leather boots, like ap
English Book goipg to shoot dipjtybirds. While ( arp
about it I might as vyell withdraw spine other piis-state-
ments ip my article, ps I would do apything rather than
hurt the feelings of the N.T. folk. To hegip with, I
accused them of Booze, Blasphemy ami Blow, and I wifi
show’ you how I came to make the mistakes.
As to the booze, I was misled by seeing all those heaps,
piles, mountains of bottles all along the D.T.—I mean
N.T. —railway line. Of course, I see now that they never
could have contained booze, but only soft-tack—sarsa-
parilla and hop-beer, with perhaps a little limejuice-
cordial here and there. My mistake, gentlemen, my
mistake ! You see, the bottles were rum, brandy, and
square-face bottles, which only shows how easily a man
can be misled, and how careful one should be before ac-
cusing sensible people of Booze.
As for blasphemousness, Coleridge himself speaks of
“ The bloody sun at noon,’' and who is to complain if they
speak of the sun that way all day long at Palmerston !
They are only following a great English classic. Besides,
what’s the use of language if you don’t make it a bit
picturesque ? The correct N.T. method of using language
is to start with a long-drawn howl like the hoot of a loco-
motive on a steep grade, thus—“ Hooooo !” This attracts
attention, and ensures a respectful silence and a fair
hearing for what you have to say.
As for blow’—well, De Rougemont was a Northern Ter-
ritory product, and I don’t think that he would have
been top-weight in any liars’ handicap there either. But
perhaps it is hardly fair to reproach them with De Rouge-
mont, as they all said up there that he was a liar.
As for the other matters in my article—well, no doubt
the mines will begin to pay, and the Northern Territory
rubies will turn out to be genuine, and the Dog Act will
be entirely suspended, and there will be a great tea-
meeting and mission to the blacks, with the G.R. in the
chair. All these things will happen after the next wet
season, or the next wet season but one.
As for the huge crane that fell into the water, I wish to
STRANGE TO SAY, HE HURRIED.
“My dear Pa. You needn’t hurry home ’cause
you think ma and me are lonely, ’cause Captain
Willis comes round every evening to keep ma com-
pany, and stays awfully late. They’re always
laughing about how small the gas-bills are since you
left, but won’t tell me the joke.—Your affectionate
daughter.”
amend that statement also. It didn’t fall at all, some-
body must have pushed it.
I think this handsome withdrawal of mine should re-
move any idea that I wished to wrong the N.T. They
are very hospitable people up there, especially the
buffalo-shooters Rees and Martin, and Lawrie, of Glencoe.
In the town, too, I could have swum in beer and square-
face if I had wanted to. But I don’t think that any
amount of beer and squareface should prevent a writer
from telling the truth in his articles, and that has made
me all the more anxious to correct the mistakes in my
first yarn. 1 trust that this will put matters on a satis-
factory footing.

A WOMAN’S LETTER.
„ Sydney, April 4, 1899.
My Dear Myse—
Mr. Justice Stephen finds his health sufficiently
recovered to permit of his taking a return passage
to Sydney this month by R.M.S. Himalaya. This,
however, is not surprising, for Lord Beauchamp
has also booked per Himalaya, and the Stephens
nourish in vice-regal society better than in any
other. One of them once travelled to Sydney
accompanied by his son, in the same boat as Lord
Jersey. “Now I know three generations of
Stephen, quoth the (then) new Governor. Mr.
Jack Want will probably come in the same boat’
unless he desires to miss a good chance of putting
the Federal situation before the new Governor.
At a recent ‘At Home, ” given by one of the
emebnties of a certain Australian capital, the
officers of a visiting warship were present. Of
course a big crowd turned up to see the blue-
jackets, and the officers, desirous of assisting,
found themselves well employed in helping the
only maid the establishment boasted of to wash
up the two dozen cups and saucers with which she
was vainly endeavoring to supply 300 guests with
afternoon tea. But “all’s well that ends well,”
and it is doubtful if ever those officers have been
present at such a novel and original “At Home”
as the first they attended on Australian shores.
All Sydney’s wild anxiety to have its winter
frocks ready for the Easter A. J.C. meeting ended
m clouds of dust, and midsummer muslins on
Saturday. The flutter to get new garbing for the
Show, the Races, and the four Easter balls,
agitated the whole city last week. One large
drapery firm sold something like twenty imported
day-dresses in half-an-hour. But most of these
superior gowns stayed at home from the first day
of the meet. Heat and dust lent an unreasonable,
isolated look to the few that ventured out. You
pitied the wearers of the frocks, and, sartorially,
pity isn’t akin to love.
Strange how few women acknowledge Autumn,
and dress for it. Heavy cloths, reps, and cash-
meres, follow right on the heels of airy summer
fabrics. The one time of the ye:.r when the soft,
dull aesthetic dresses of the well-dressed woman in
novels, may be indulged in happily is insulted
with thick, cold weather garments, or tired
summer frocks.
In Saturday’s filmy dresses, the latest Madden
bride, Mrs. H. Osborne, snared the closest
attention. Her plump little person was gowned
in a mauve-colored flowery-silk muslin, made with
flowing panniers, and her grey felt hat was turned
up in front in the characteristic manner of her
sisters, and was trimmed with purple velvet, and a
sweeping feather or two. Another keenly-in-
spected bride was Mrs. Herbert Marks, in a pink
flowered muslin and a mauve hat decked with
bunches of lilac. This extremely pretty bride was
accompanied by her mother, Mrs. Pilcher, in a
brown foulard sprinkled with red flowers, and by
Dr. Herbert Marks, wearing quite an English
complexion. A graceful dress, that would send
many people into ecstasies, was Mrs. O ’Gorman’s
long-tailed black silk, appliqued with jewelled
cream lace, and lightened with a pink waistband
and smart pink medici collar. Mrs. Hugh Dixson,
junr., wore a cloth frock and velvet toque in the
new shade of Cuban red. This color is a hesitation
between purple and the good old magenta, and is
going to make itself felt during the coming season.
Mrs. Lovely crowned a grey frock, braided in
mauve, with a purple hat. A large fair-haired
living picture, now domesticated in Melbourne,
was another who defied temperature. Her bright
“gendarme-blue” cloth was about the most con-
spicuous frock on the lawn. An extensive
polonaise, covered with thick guipure, was finished
off with blue velvet sleeves and underskirt, and
topped with a wide black feather hat.
After all the talk about the new tea-room, it
was disappointing to come on a common asphalt
floor, hard white paint, and a record contrivance
for letting in draughts. This sublimated barn
still clings to the racecourse traditions about
catering. The rough-and-ready style of waiting,
the “social ” brand of the provisions, the durable
structure of the antique sandwiches—these have
all turned up again, in spite of the much-vaunted
‘ improvements.”
In the evening, the races went bodily to welcome
back the Broughs at the Theatre Royal. You saw
there all the same faces that had passed you on
the lawns in the afternoon, looking—well, night
works miracles. A great, gay, vivacious, much-
dressed circle overflowed into all the boxes and
the front stalls. Mrs. Stanley Mylius, in a black
sleeveless frock with diamonds and no gloves,
made a lovely centre for a big party in a lower
box. In the box above, Mrs. Bernard Wise’s girl-
ish profile peeped round the curtains. As for the
circle itself, they were all there —all the names
you know so well. Nobody with rings or mani-
cured fingers wore gloves. Spangled fans were
everywhere, and so were the long velvet cloaks,
made with loose sleeves and a satin lining, that
will sweep over well-bred evening gowns this
season. Mrs. Rennie, in the front row, wore
white satin with pink roses on the corsage. Also
m the front was Mrs. Harry Levy in blue.
By the way, the front row isn’t sought after so
frantically by men as by women. Looking round
at the Broughs’ first night I noticed that most of
the masculine faces at the inner edge of the circle
looked melancholy. The ordeal of sitting out a
play in the full sight of hundreds of restless eyes,
and, worse still, of having to gaze at hundreds of
human faces when the gas goes up, is hard on
those who don’t run a perpetual show. And, worse
still—but that is another question which you, dear
Myee, are not supposed to understand. Still, if
its a dry, hot night, you may be allowed to sym-
pathise, blindly, overhead in the dress-circle dur-
ing the prologue of “Sans-Gene.” “If Mrs.
Broutrh irons a shirt, I’ll say she can act.” This
was said by a Man. Strangely enough, a god was
smitten with the same idea. “If she’s a laun-
dress, why don’t she iron one of the boss’s shirts.”
To which the other god: “You don’t s’pose
Brough’s goin’ to have a shirt spoiled every night,
do you ? ”
To you, Myee, I own I would like to have
seen it done. The piquancy of watching a'shirt
ironed by Mrs. Brough would have added an in-
describable novelty to that rather tame bit of
handkerchief flattening. Besides, who knows ! !
It might have made shirt-ironing fashionable, and
think how that would have helped out the weary
existence of the bachelors who are always wailing
in a certain paper that they can’t marry because
the girl of the day can’t put a gloss on a shirt-
front.
Three beautiful cloaks in “Sans Gene” strike
very close to the dominant fashion-note of our
own day. They are long, ample, and fashioned in
velvet. The first is of cerise velvet bordered with
black fur that falls over to reveal a dull green
lining. Over the cerise a bold, square sort of
pattern is gorgeously worked in black and gold
embroidery. The second is a fresh, vivid apple-
green edged with ermine and lined with white
satin. Miss Temple covers Napoleon’s sister with
yet a, third striking cloak. An apricot plush em-
broidered with steel and gold in a pattern that
looked like bunches of grapes from the d.c. This
was lined with a lemon satin and bordered all
round with grey fur.
Few plays lean as heavily as “Sans-Gene” on
the acting of one woman. The piece is really
nothing else but Sans-Gene herself. On Saturday,
Mrs. Brough was in such a highly-strung condition
that it wouldn’t, be fair to take that night as every
night; but the impression she left on me was that
her method was just the good old novelist’s plan of
telling you all about a character on the first page.
You know the style. He was a very ambitious
man. He had a noble disposition. His nature was
generous to an extreme. And then, as everything
is set down on the outside, the inner man has no
necessity to show himself. Under all the vivacity
and violence, the gestures of the laundress, her way
of saying this and that, and moving, and laughing,
and slanging, and blazing out heroically, one
failed to see the definite woman who would give
blood and reality to the shadow.
Another impression from this play is the harsh-
ness of the English language when brought into a
French atmosphere. To hear the laundry-girls
address Sans GSne as “ Miss,” “Yes, Miss,” “No,
Miss,” to hear the inimitable Frenchwoman her-
self talk about her boots “ busting ,” and “lydies”
in up-to-date Cockney English, destroyed all illu-
sions about Sans Gene being a Frenchwoman of
Napoleon’s day.
Monday, the second day of the races was wet.
Hpwever, as Sydney Cup is always dressed for
beyond any other day of the Easter meeting,
women who had been keeping back their smartest
fripperies persisted in sporting them despite the
ruinous weather. The bright colors that used to
flash about the vice-regal box when the Hampdens
and their friends were there gave place to sombre
effects under the Darley regime. Lady Darley
was wearing black silk, like one in authority, with
a black velvet cape and a little black bonnet. Miss
Sylvia Darley made her reappearance after her long
illness in mauve—yes, the veto of many years has
been taken off the word, everyone uses it; and
a scheme is even on foot to set free another old
servant-galism, that got into disgrace through
being seen everywhere, the artless puce— and a
feather boa. Miss Kitty Darley and the Misses
Pearson, who were also in the V.R. box, left an
impression of dull fawns and greys that was not
peculiarly striking.
Many of the dresses in the members’ stand were
lovely schemes that never got a chance to unfold.
There was no lawn-walking; consequently the
long, eel skirts, that follow the figure without one
solitary gather or pleat at the back of the
waist-belt, and are so clammy and clinging on
a wet day that to walk in them is an
art—or an error—were not seen at their
worst. Mrs. W. B. Mitchell was less conspicuous
than usual in a grey green “ tailor made, ” and a
purple toque with a long shaded feather running
backwards. The two little Geisha sisters, Miss
Florence and Miss Beatrice Perry, suffered from the
unwholesome colors of their brick-red coats and
small white sailor hats with green straw linings
and green bands. Miss Wade-Brown looked
skilfully seasonable in a red toque, and smart little
red jacket over a plaid skirt. Miss Gillin’s
pale grey coat and skirt was a thing of charm,
with a turquoise hat, and an exceptional cut.
Miss Fosbery sported a piped purple cloth, with a
blue vest—a combination that many people
affected. Mrs. Burdekin in cigar-brown cloth,
and green velvet cape, joined in the plot to abolish
veils, and wore her brown fur and feather toque
without one.
They say this year’s N.S.W. Agricultural
Society’s show is the biggest for years. The open-
ing came off on Thursday, and was graced by the
acting-vice-regal party. Very few extra frills
were put on for this occasion. Mrs. John See,
wife of the society’s president, had a tea-party in
one of the refreshment-rooms, and there one saw
that the show was not extensively patronised by
snobility proper. In short, people don’t go to a
show without a motive,_ unless they come from the
country, where a cow is a motive for putting on
one’s best dress, and a ploughing-machine is a
motive, and a ride in a Sydney tram is quite a big,
enticing motive. Still, despite Nice people’s
reluctance to dress for anythin" so distinctly rural,
there were many prominent folk present. Mrs.
W. R. Wilson, from Melbourne, in a dull green
muslin and a big black picture hat; the pretty,
fresh-faced bevy of “Sam Hordern” girls, in
simple little summer frocks; Mrs. Harry Levy
in a French-grey tailor suit.
Madame Emily Sol dene is leaving Sydney next
month for London, and a big circle of friends are
at work on a matinee by way of a farewell benefit.
I hear that Mme. Soldene is to continue her racy
Evening News gossip in the shape of a “ London
Week-by-Week ” letter.
.The benefit of this week will be Pattie Browne’s
matinee at Her Majesty’s on Friday, April 7.
An alluring programme includes Pattie in the
letter-scene from “ The Country Girl,” the Geisha
cp. in the second act of “The Geisha,” Lottie
Moore, Dante, The Holloway Co., Chas. Kenning-
ham, and other attractions.
. A pretty young soprano, Miss Daisy Davies,
gives a concert, under Ministerial patronage, at
a 6 .X-M.C.A., on the evening of Thursday,
April 6.
-Paring Holy Week the impressive services at
ot. Mary’s R.C. Cathedral were attended by thou-
sands of worshippers, and the regular members of
congregation declared that whenever they went to
the big church, no matter how early, the seats
were packed with Protestants—the' pew-holders
and supporters of the church having to stand or sit
wherever there was room for them. This is indeed
a strange cause of complaint from the R.C’s., ad-
mittedly the world’s strongest proselytising body ;
but they probably guess that it is the sensuous,
and not merely the devotional, side of the heretics’
natures that drives them to the one true fold
during Lent and Easter.
Yet another (very youthful) pair have fallen
victims to the romantic atmosphere of the Uni-
versity. The engagement is announced of Miss
-Banny Marr and Mr. Jack (son of the Q. Govt
geologist). Miss Marr will take the B.A. and Mr.
Jack the B.E. degree on the 22nd inst.
The wedding of Miss Dolly Wilson and Mr.
rank Russell, barrister-at-law, is to take place
about 20th inst. Miss Wilson is the eldest
daughter of Mrs. Bowie Wilson who died last
year and is a very clever girl. Mr. Russell is one
ot the few University students who attended
evening lectures and gained a B.A. degree in three
years -the average length of time for evening
students being five years.
All the Sydney Lancers are not made of very
stern stuff, judging by the heartrending accounts
that have already reached their friends and rela-
tives of the miseries of the voyage. One young
hero, who protested that he was feeling more
homesick than seasick, begged to be put off the
boat at Albany so that he could get back as soon
as possible to his own dear home, and not go fur-
ther on the way to that nasty Old England. To
his infinite distress he was told that he was under
a three-years’ engagement, and that he was bound
to see the thing through once he had started.
Writes my Melbourne correspondent:—
“ ‘Belle of New York’ drew such an Easter
Saturday crush at Melb. Princess’s that there
wasn’t even leaning-room left back of the d.c., and
late-comers thanked their stars if the person
standing in front was short enough to be seen over.
Indeed, small men were sought after more than
they liked in such sweltering weather. A little ’un
could be easily located in front row of standers by
his rear-guard of belated women, peering over
each shoulder and dodging his head.
“ Local youth, ’tis said, especially those too
young to have been warned by last Yankee in-
vasion, have been quite unnerved all week by
anticipations of the ‘ Belle, ’ and accompanying
galaxy of American beauty. When big, fair,
buxom Louise Royce, first sample shown, frisked
on, dressed for her 9th wedding in white satin
princess-robe, she tripped and fell heavily, poor
soul! on her front corsage. 11l omen. And bad
luck sat tight, for the programme dragged, and, as
Girard refrains in one of his songs, ‘A cloud came
o’er ’ things in general.
“The fallen heroine aforesaid, like her col-
leagues, changed her frock every two minutes or
s .°\ But, as a rule, her things are no more de-
liciously chic than anyone else’s, though her black
gauze over green silk, worn with terra-cotta hat,
has no cause to feel down-tailed. Belle Bucklin,
as petite Parisienne ‘Fifi,’ is like a leedle Deutch
gals rather than a Frenchwoman, with her flaxen
thatch, wide mouth, and well-nourished, inexpres-
sive arms. Mostly, she favors short skirts, begin-
ning with white muslin as a candy-charmer off a
wedding cake, and passing on to something peachy,
flounced, and fleecy, in which she trills a dance
rather prettily re ‘La Gay Parisienne,’ in com-
pany with other pinky-lilac poseuses.
“Judging by ‘ Belle ’ toilettes—lilac, lavender,
petunia and purple are rampant in New York,
with yellow thrown in to break the monotony.
‘Over thar,’skirts flounced to the hip join on to
fussy belt-bodices with transparent sleeves and
chemisette. A wearer, whose figure-curves merit
publicity, affects princess robe, or polonaise of
princess-cut, never forgetting lashings and lavings
of frills and flounces. On the Atlantic slope, lacy
lovers’ knots, muslin ‘ bugs, ’ and similar applique
fal-lals have sunk, seemingly, to the level of
Bowery she-toughs.
“Local Salvation Sarahs should take a costume
wrinkle or two from the ‘Belle ’ in her Hallelujah
days. Red satin bonnet-lining, glimpse of scarlet
underskirt, auburn plait a-hanging down her
back. As Pa Bronson’s heiress, the ex-devil
thumper (Louise Hepner) starts an upper-crust
rescue league, uniformed quite deliciously. Said
regimentals, in scribe’s opinion, are worth all the
rest of the wardrobe put together. The Belle
herself sports vivandiere coat, and knee-high skirt
of the richest, sheeniest, ivory satin extant. And
such a tip-top pair of glove-fit, w'hite kid gaiters,
with cunning loops and buttons on the off-side.
Long white gloves, mass of sulphur roses under
bonnet brim, white and gold military staff.
“All the same, judging by data supplied, it’s
easier to be Belle of New York than of Melbourne.
To capture the latter position, a candidate who
can only describe herself truthfully as a fine figure
of a girl with a handsome head of hair, must
indeed get up early—indeed, she needs to get up
the week before.
“Asthmatic and hay-feverish subjects in the
d.c. on the ‘ Belle’s ’ first night were to be pitied.
One sniffed in violet powder and Fuller’s earth
with every breath. It must have been shovelled
on at the theatre, because home-layers would have
brushed off en route. Some women are whales for
powder. Wild horses couldn’t drag them past a
gratuitous supply. You’ll see them contorting
themselves to reach down their spines with some
bald-headed, repulsive, all-things-to-all-men puff.
And it isn’t as if critical male brutes would get a
chance of spying out the swarthiness of their back-
bones, ’cause floury females always wear their
things so tight that when they faint, as they’re
fond of doing, you couldn’t wedge so much as a
remedial watch-key down their backs.
“A local Sawbones tells me that he once wrote
with his finger in the starch lying thick on the
nut-brown shoulders of an unconscious grass-
widow, ‘ Whited sepulchre! ’ I hae ma doots, for
she was his best patient, so he says.
“ Gallery inmates were a shade skittish that
first night. They tired of Baseballer Don in his
rdle of a crazy German, a daft stranger in a
strange land. Mummer’s dialect and quaint
Teutonic simplicity were realistic, but there was
an overdose of the ‘polite lunatic,’ as of every-
thing else.
“Oscar Girard, as Pa Bronson, is like a dried-
up Yank edition of Gov. Hampden. No novel
dress wrinkles to be picked up from the plumage
of these stage ’Merican johnnies. Millionaire 8.,
I noticed, moistened his fingers to work on new
gloves. But better not adopt this as ‘ real N’York
style ’ till it transpires whether the old man
merely acted so as a reminder that he began life
with half a dime.
“The irreproachable dames who have hitherto
managed Melbourne Women’s Hospital in the
interests of male doctors, and who took an annual
opportunity to despise the applications of femald
doctors, are fairly beaten at last. Two or three
of their trousered idols cleared out of the show in
a hurry, and when they advertised for a resident
medical officer for the infirmary department, the
only candidate was Dr. Violet May Plummer,
resident surgeon at Melb. Hospital. So the com-
mittee pulled a long, sour face and told Dr. Violet
that she would do. They might have added that
they couldn’t help themselves.
“That well-known journalist, Mr. Bob Burt,
erstwhile of the Agk, lately returned to Mel-
bourne from Queensland, so weak from phthisis
that he could do no work. Mr. David Syme has
sent him up to his fine station near Lilydale, in
clear mountain air, and bidden him stay there and
get well if he can.
“ The illness of Melbourne’s popular Mayoress,
the too energetic Mrs. M‘Eacharn, which began
with a cinder in the eye, is proving much more
serious than was at first anticipated. Partial
paralysis of the face set in, followed by erysipelas,
and the three doctors at present in attendance
take a grave view of the case.
“ The news that a highly-connected N.S.W.
lady had become suddenly insane was received by
all shades of Melbourne society with very real ex-
pressions of regret.

The relationship to Lord Beauchamp of
the Dowager Lady Raglan, bound for Sydney
with the new Governor, is the peculiar one of
having been the second wife of Lord Raglan,
whose first wife was Beauchamp’s aunt.
The Bulletin was glad to receive by the
English mail a letter from B. E. Minns, the well-
known Australian artist, announcing his progress
towards convalescence. He was still in a private
ward at Guy’s Hospital, slowly recovering from
the effects of an operation.
Vic. Commercial Travellers’ Association
has decided not to offer another prize for the Most
Beautiful Bagman at the annual picnic. The
lovely creature who won it last year has endured
much subsequent unhappiness through the taunts
of his plain, ordinary contemporaries, and the
association feels itself responsible for the sad de-
terioration of his witching smile.
The grandfather of S.A.’s new Governor
had a queer ad venture once in Russia. Grandpa
Tennyson was dining with Lord St. Heliers,
Bull’s Minister at St. Petersburg, when the topic
of the strangling of the inad Czar Paul came
up. It should be remembered that Bona-
parte and Paul had arranged simultaneously
to invade India, but when Paul’s mania
became too pronounced and he was
strangled, Bonaparte declared in Paris
Moniteur that Britain had engineered
the assassination With reference to
this statement, the Tennyson in ques-
tion thoughtlessly remarked “ that it
was perfectly well-known that Count
So-and-So .murdered the Emperor! ”
A 400-ton silence fell on the company,
for amongst the guests was the man
referred to. After dinner Lord St.
Heliers gave Tennyson the “office ” to
clear out for his life, which he did—
travelling in obscure ways for weeks
until he reached a Crimean village. Once
in three months an English Embassy
courier used to pass that way, and, with
his aid, Tennyson hoped to escape. The
courier, a drunkard, dropped his des-
patches, which Tennyson picked up, and
the courier in gratitude smuggled him
through a frontier town, and eventually Ten-
nyson made his way to England.
One of the unpublished yams of Vic.
Black Wednesday relates to the reinstate-
ment of Capt. Standish as Chief Commis-
jioner of Police. Standish was included in the
Civil Service sweep-out, but he merely smiled
and told the late George Bowen, the Gov. of the
day, that he expected to be reinstated at once.
Fond of “ bachelor life ” as Bowen was he did
not hesitate, and Standish’s reappointment was
gazetted. The keen-eyed captain was, no doubt,
choke-full of valuable in formation about Bowen.
Lord Beauchamp’s family motto—“ Strong
through Faith”—is suitable for any person who
complacently assumes the position of Himperial
figurehead. Strong through Faith—in himself.
“ Born to Self-Assurance,” or “ Believing in Beau-
champ,” would be equally impressive.
N.S. W. Chief-Justice Darley lias held his
present law office 13 years. His predecessors :
C.-J. Forbes sat from 1824 (the date of his arrival
in Sydney—he was appointed the year before) till
1837 —13 years; C.-J. Dowling, 8 years; C.-J.
Stephen, 29 years, and C.-J. Martin i 3 years.
One other black mark against the coming
Gov. Tennyson. He wound up a letter acknow-
ledging a public meeting’s congratulations on his
appointment with the words “Fare you well.” A
man who writes like that nearly always goes on
stilts ; and his seem to be particularly high ones.
The name of Burgess is unlucky in Aus-
tralasia. Butler passed for some years under it,
another Burgess was unjustly arrested for the
Gatton murders, a Burgess was the boss Maunga-
tapu murderer ; and last week a Burgess in a fit
of insanity murdered his wife and two children
in S. A.
Broken Hillionaire David James, who has
had almost enough of the turf, now developes an
unexpected desire to fly his colors in Parliament.
He has his eye on Light (Kapunda), where he is
principal in a big foundry. James owes his
“ rise ” to the fact that he happened to be in the
district with his team when the Hill was pegered.
Dick Ireland, Q.C., in Melb.,
had a knack of winking at the jury
while his antagonist orated. One morn-

and said, “My jury-eye is out of

Of course such things are never
done nowadays, but in the period of
Vogel’s scramble for office politicians
grabbed things as they came and asked
few questions. Once when Julius was
holding on by a hair, one of liis faithful
supporters in M.L. House of Represen-
tatives was a Canterbury member with
a drouth on him. His drouth generally
came on him worst at times of political
excitement, and the result was that just
when his vote was most wanted he
would be most unanimously absent.
On one critical occasion Vogel locked
his supporter, with the latter’s consent,
in a top-floor room to keep him dry till
the division. But Oppositionists who
heard of it got at a skylight and silently
lowered into the room at the end of a
string one bottle of whisky, one of
brandy and one of beer. The Canter-
bury man took these blessings as they
canie. Half-an-hour later some more
Oppositionists heard of how Vogel was
saving up the beer stricken member,
and they at once got the same inspira-
tion. So they also risked their necks
on the roof, and having mistakenly
broken open the wrong sky-light they
lowered a vast quantity of miscellan-
eous refreshments into a room where
some clerks were working. The latter
gave 16 cheers as they saw the liquor
descending, and proceeded to drink it
there and then. Vogel found his mem-
ber incapable, and in his wrath tried to
carry him under his arm and have his
vote counted, but the Canterbury man
was too far gone, and Julius dropped
him under the table in disgust.
Inspector Urquhart, who has had charge
of the Gatton murder enquiry, has been head of
the Criminal Investigation Department in the
Northern capital for about two years past. His
qualification for the position is somewhat unusual.
He began life at sea, in the mercantile marine ;
was afterwards engaged in telegraph-line con-
struction in N.Q. ; was then in the native police,
and had charge of the police cutter in Torres
Straits. After a short connection with the metro-
politan police as sub-inspector he was promoted
to the charge of the detective department.

“ Maorilander ” : Re that yarn (Bulletin
25/3/’99) about Sullivan, the Maungatapu (pron.
“ Mokotap ”) murderer, seeking gaol-protection in
Victoria, and afterwards dying in a N.S.W. hos-
pital. Have always understood, and never heard
any other story in M.L., that Sullivan died of
cancer over ’Frisco way. As to his seeking pro-
tection, writer has frequently heard from his own
people, who were among the searchers for the
bodies of the victims, and living in Nelson at the
time, that Mr. Kempthorne (Kempthorne, Prosser
and Co.), whose brother was among the murdered,
had repeatedly said he would shoot Sullivan
on sight, if opportunity offered. Kempthorne was
notoriously a man of his word, and it is known
that, when the miscreant was pardoned (Queen’s
evidence), Govt, had to keep him in gaol till he
could be smuggled off in an Amci ica bound vessel.
A present Australian gaol-
photographer once applied for
the triple offices of photo-
grapher, flagellator, and hang-
man. A pity his application
was refused. Granting it would
have saved the brutalising of at
least two alleged human beings.
Vogel, like all leading
Maoriland politicians, died poor.
He was so “stony” when he
came to M.L. to re-enter poli-
tics in ’B4 that his enemies
alleged he borrowed .£lOOO from
Stout to pay his expenses. Stout
was a generous man, and, so far,
the story looked plausible, but
its improbability lay in the fact
that Robert of Shetland was
none too rich himself in those
days. Vogel wasn’t poor, like
so many other M.L- politicians,
through any neglect of his own
interests. He made money, as
Colonial Treasurer and Agent-
General, out of the handling of
the huge loans which the pro-
vince put through in his time
(some of Vogel’s demands for
commission were a public scan-
dal), but he spent freely on
lavish entertainments, such as
no Australasian Premier nowa-
days would dream of, and his
card-parties were at one time
notorious in Wellington. He
was a good loser and prompt
payer—and that is why Julius
Vogel was thankful in his old
age for a paltry .£3OO a-year as
Maoriland Financial Adviser in London.
The Mr. Wood who recently introduced a
deputation to N.S.W. Mines Minister Cook is
no less a person than the able Harrie Wood,
N.S.W. Under-Secretary for Mines for nearly a
quarter of a century. Mr. Wood is now mining
“on his own.” Forty-five years ago he worked
over the better part of Victoria. He originated
Ballarat School of Mines, and held several official
positions under the Vic. Govt.
Some of the Vic. Labor-members are noted
for the fact that they never, by any chance, miss
a free feed, a Parliamentary excursion, a Govt.
House shivoo, a Mayoral invite, anything, in fact,
where the drink and vittles are at all passable. It
is somewhat to Trenwith’s credit that he seldom
appears at such affairs, and, when he does, he often
departs as empty and as dry as he came. Tren-
with may be nobbled some day through his ambi-
tion, but never through his stomach.
Once again a N.S.W. Ministerial crisis
occurs when Attorney-General Want is holiday-
ing. Every Ministry witli which Mr. Want has
worked experienced a crisis, some of them more
than once, while he was out of the provinoe in
pursuit of health and happiness.
The trial of Michael Kelly, charged with
murdering his inamorata, Maria Flynn, was set
down for sth April, the day fixed for the execu-
tion of Briggs, who slew his sweetheart, Maggie
Dutt. Kelly and Briggs were confined in the
same gaol (Darlinghurst), and at 10 o’clock (the
hour appointed for the choking of Briggs) Kelly
was to step out into the court next door, to stand in
the dock where Briggs was sentenced to death, to
be tried before the same Judge. Some men need
all their nerve.
W. H. Groom has again been returned for
Toowqomba, which, despite all opposition, he has
uninterruptedly represented for 40 years —ever
since Separation, in fact. .Various suggestions
have been made as to the secret of his success,
but it is undoubtedly the individual favors and
assistance which his experience enables him to
confer among his constituents. His political
record is indeed remarkable, seeing that since he
first entered politics a generation has passed in
Toowoomba, and another has taken its place.
Claude Vautin, well - known consulting
metallurgist and director of a number of Westra-
lian and other co’s,' has been committed for trial
at the Old Bailey on a charge of having exten-
sively defrauded London stockbrokers. It is
alleged that he ran off to America with about
£20,000. When in Far N.Q., years ago, Vautin,
then a handsome young fellow, the idol of the
women and the envy of the men, was mining-
partner of “ Jim ” Parker, who disappeared
mysteriously from Sydney not long ago, and is
believed to be dead. Vautin was a very expert
metallurgist, and was well-known in Australia in
connection with the Newbery-Vautin process.
When in Opposition, Julius Vogel was his
own whip, and a'good one, too, though rather
reckless. Stafford’s Ministry was in power at the
end of ’72 and the beginning of ’73, but Vogel was
only one or two votes short of being strong enough
to regain office. He proposed his no-confidence
motion, and “The Smiler,” a dreary, giggling
nonentity from down South, became the centre of
attraction, he being the only man who had not de-
clared himself. The division was reached after
fierce debate ; “ the Smiler ” was the very last
member to leave the chamber for the telling
lobbies, and, after much consideration, he walked
into the Opposition camp. Vogel won by two
votes. Seen shortly afterwards, an angry Govt,
man said to him: “ Look here, Vogel, is it true that
you offered that beast ‘ the Smiler ’ a portfolio for
his vote?” “Perfectly,” replied the Hebrew.
“ And do you mean to give it to him? ” “H —m,
that’s another question,” said VogeL “ The
Smiler’s ” portfolio never came.

N.S. W. Lieut.-Governor and Chief Justice
Darley, at St. Patrick’s Day banquet, boasted of
his Irishism. He comes from one of the Toriest
families in Dublin. His father was an attorney
and a clerk in the Court of Chancery; his grand-
father, High Sheriff of Dublin in the time of the
1798 insurrection, and, in later life, chief P.M.
and alderman of the city, of which he was Lord
Mayor in 1808-9. The alderman's father was a
merchant of. the.city. Judge Darley’s uncle, still
alive, was called to the Irish Bar in 1830, the year
in which the N.S, W. Chief Justice was born, and
has not long retired from a County Court Judge-
ship.

“ Oamiro ” : In the “ good times ” about
SO shearers, fresh from a “ cut-out,” struck
a lone shanty out-back, and were soon seated
round the long table in the eating-room. The
shouting started, and went round once. Mid-way
round the second time Brown didn’t respond, and
it was his “shout.” His neighbors shook him—
he was lying back on his chair, head on chest.
They remarked that Brown had got drunk “ very
sudden.” Then an observant shearer found that
Brown wasn’t drunk—only dead. It was resolved
that they couldn’t spoil the fun. So they took
the dead man’s cheque out, the corpse shouted
and they drank his health, and the ball rolled on
till Brown was stiff as well as defunct. His
cheque was for 30 odd sovs. !

Dear Bulletin. —Re “Two Westralians
have a wager as to whether or not poisonous
snakes bite their prey with poison-fangs before
swallowing.” No Australian snake kills its prey
with its poison-fangs. The fangs are always used
by the snake to hold its prey, and when in that
service are not unfrequentlv broken ; but in no
case is poison injected into the wounds the fangs
may inflict. In some six or seven different ways I
have proved this. Nature never blunders. An
Australian snake can only bite with deadly effect
four times; frequently not more than twice. Now
a hungry snake will swallow at a feed from eight
to fourteen mice ; and if it had to bite and poison
each of these its poison would be exhausted and
itself rendered harmless. But will anyone ven-
ture to try a bite from an Aust. venomous snake
after it has dined off even 14 mice ? I for one
shall not. —H. J. M'Cooey.

“S. Snell”: Entirely disagree with the
<<IVT „ , . . J , -jvyr i
“ Mac. who in a recent par. declares the Mongol
of real life to be an earnest purveyor of vege-
tables who never cracks a joke m the whole course
of Ins existence. This is the mistake of the per-
son who knows Ah Cat only when on business
bent. The common Chow is often a gay and fes-
tive cuss given to frantic horseplay and immoder-
ate laughter. As a youngster I saw much of
Chinamen in their camps at Ballarat, Bendigo,
Clunes, Ores wick, Dunolly, St. Arnaud, and other
big Mongolian centres, and the sight of a score or
so of adult Oonfuciana performing maniacal
monkey tricks in the vicinity of their gardens and
shrieking like schoolboys was not infrequent. The
Chinese joke is usually practical, and often turns
on the torture of animals, but nobody who has
observed the Chow in the lump will deny its
existence. Used to see much of the Mongols at a
camp near the old Bonshaw, Ballarat, and there
the favorite Sunday morning entertainment con-
sisted in baiting a fowl with crackers. The
wretched hen was secured by one leg, and crackers
were thrown at her until she gave up the ghost.
It takes a long time to kill a robust pullet in this
way, but throughout the proceedings the heathen
raged with exceeding glee. The impression that
the Chinaman is kind to animals is due to his
tender devotion to his horse, or his pig—animals
which represent hard cash, and the value of which
is deteriorated by ill-usage. The baited hen was
always eaten.

It was in the sixties, when squatters “ of
the old sort ” still existed. It had been a grand
season, and the wool-yield was phenomenal, so
from his far-away Queensland station Duncan
Chisholm started for Sydney on “a bender.” On
the second or third day out he got to a quiet little
place—a pub., a store, and a blacksmith’s. That
was the lot. Duncan had his tea, and then a
whisky or two—and the fun began. He smashed
everything in the bar, and all the crockery he
could see in the kitchen, and then quietly sat
down on the verandah and demanded “ the bill.”
It was presented—.£l2—and he gave a cheque for
it with the pleased smile of a man who was having
a good time. Two days later he arrived in Too-
woomba, and broke the Sabbath evening calm by
a demand for dinner and a dozen boiled eggs.
When they arrived he asked the waiter and
generally-useless: “James, were you ever a
cricketer?” To which the unfortunate James
innocently replied, “Oh, dear, yes, Mr. Chisholm:
I was longstop to our first eleven for three years.’’
“ Then stop that! ” shouted Chisholm, seizing an
egg, and shying it at James, whom it hit
right on the cheek; “ and that, and that, and
that, and that!” as egg after egg spattered itself
over James. And after the eggs—forks, spoons,
cups, saucers, cruets, one after the other went
hurtling through the atmosphere, some sticking in
the panelling, and some wrecking the windows
and the pictures. James fled, covered with
egg, and left the storm to rage as it might. Dun-
can demolished the chairs, mirrors, chandeliers,
tore down the mantelpiece by main force, and
even threw most of the carpet out of the window,
and, when it was all over, sat down again, quiet
as a lamb, and called for “the bill.” .£4l was its
amount, but he drew a cheque for £45, the £4 to
be divided amongst the servants. He seems to
have got safely through Brisbane, and the end was
in Sydney. He was known there, as also were his
habits. At the Royal, at which he stayed, a big
public dinner was to take place. It was an invi-
tation affair. Chisholm wished to go, and asked
the head-waiter to procure him the needful. The
waiter did his best, but Chisholm was met with a
refusal. He did not say much, but he thought.
All was ready for the dinner—three long tables
were set, with choice flowers and fine cut-glass—
and the guests were assembling, when suddenly
an almighty smash was heard in the dining-room,
Chisholm had got (unknown to the waiters) a stout
needle and thread and sewn all the tablecloths

“ V. 8.” on a droving subject:—
In camp at night one restless bullock can cause im-
mense trouble. Curious that if any beast in the mob
considers it his bounden duty to be restless he always lies
on the outside. He gets up, generally at dead of night,
stretches himself, twists his tail, and if you don’t go up
and keep speaking to him (in order to take his attention)
he will walk up to his nearest neighbor and give him a
friendly prod, either in the ribs or the small of the back ;
this always brings the prodded beast to his feet. He in
turn goes through the stretching performance, and gives
his neighbor a prod. In this wav, with each fresh riser
putting in a friendly prod, the whole mob
is soon brought to its feet. If a bullock
seems restless, keep your eye on him.
As soon as he gets up, go and talk to
him ; if this is done he soon lies down
again, leaving the rest of the mob
A GOOD PERFORMER.
MR. CITYBRED : “ You say your horse is fast. Has he any performances?"
MR. BACKBLOCKS : “ Waal, yes. He killed a man up North, and throw'd Yalter Jim at the
Show last year; but he's done nothin' since. ”
undisturbed. Apropos, at night you can always ted
when a bullock lies down. As soon as he settles he draws
a long breath, and gives forth a sort of human sigh on
a large scale, audible in the stillness for a couple of hun-
dred yards.

“Scot'y” : Even in the bush exists the
desire for titles. A jackeroo, left temporarily in
charge of a station, alters the signature of trespass
notice to “Nincom Poope, sub-manager.” The
manager is now “ superintendent,” on the stations
of one large grindicate. The storeman (,£52 per
an.) is “book-keeper.” There are also “in
charge ” and “ second in charge ” of sheep (17/6 a
week). Slushy is “cook’s assistant”—“wood
and water joey ” is “ superintendent’s yard-man.”
The milk and cowboy is “ dairyman ” (10/- a
week). Same in the towns. The bank-clerks are
“bankers,” the herdsman is “ common ranger,”
the bum is “sheriff.”

“ Aleck ” : Talking about the
appetite of emus. I had a friend
who was farming furthest out in
Western N.S.W. He had
bought the newest thing in
harvesters, and, having
carted it out there, had
to leave it out unguard-
ed. The thing was pulled
to pieces, and nearly
every scrap of ironwork
removed. Well, it was
an amazing mystery to
us all, till we heard that
a mob of emus had passed
in the night. Ten of us
saddled up, and started out
after the flock. We hunted
them for three days, and shot
every head. Then we opened them
up, collected all the missing iron-mongery, and,
in a week, we had that harvester together again,
and working at her best gait. When the emus
up there couldn’t get iron any other way, they
would steal the shoes off the horses.

It doesn’t take long to fix up a township
nowadays when a nugget is stumbled over in the

Wollubar, 27 miles from Kalgoorlie. There was
a rush ; and a man who had some sheep out that
way joined in with the animals, an axe, a knife,

A very amorous insurance-agent struck a Q.
mining town a few months ago, and a plot was
organised to “take him down.” So one day he
received a letter signed “ Daly ” in which the
writer accused him of attempting to leave his girl
with a past, and threatening to “deal outstoush ”
accordingly. The insurance-agent confided the
matter to one of the plotters, who spoke sym-
pathetically and advised him to see the police.
He said he would, and the others dodged up a back
street to get to the police station first. “What - !
Daly ! ” shrieked Sergeant , when the insur-
ance-agent confided his trouble to him, “why, he’s
the greatest ruffian in the town. He’s just done
a stretch for disfiguring a mine-manager and
assaulting the police.” The agent slunk sorrow-


Ask yourself this : If you require a new dress or
a suit of clothes, would you go to the ironmonger’s store
to procure them ? Certainly not ! Then why go to the
draper’s for general hardware ? It is far cheaper to pro-
cure your ironmongery from the ironmonger, because he
keeps the best selection of useful articles. You will find
that we can supply your requirements cheaper and better.
Why? Because it is our business, and we are in a posi-
tion to deal in a practical and business-like manner, thus
saving you time and money. For E.P. ware, table and
pocket cutlery, household, furnishing and builders’ iron-
mongery try M'Lean Bros, and Rigg, Ltd., George-street,

fully away and went to consult the leading
local lawyer. “ No, I won’t touch any case with
Daly in it,’’ said the man of law, who was in the
swim. “ He’s got a murderous push behind him,
and I’d be in fear of my life ever after.” With a
look of sickly terror the agent returnod to his
hotel, out of which he firmly declined to stir for
five days. Then one of the conspirators offered
to seek out Daly, and try and square the
thing if the agent was willing to part. lhe
latter agreed, and a meeting of the pair was
arranged to take place outside the Stock Ex-
change that night, the agent to be strongly
escorted in case of trouble. A hurried search was
made around the town to find a man to represent
Daly, and a burly miner was at length secured for
half-a-sov.—his part being duly rehearsed. Busi-
ness was suspended on the Fjxchange that night,
and half the town rolled up to see the fun. Daly,
followed by the finest selection of toughs in the
district, met the agent at the appointed time and
demanded a “tenner” to say no more about it.
The agent’s supporters agreed that this was a fair
thing, and he had no alternative but to “fork
out.” Then they all adjourned to the nearest
hotel and “did the tenner in,” and after the
fortieth beer the matter somehow leaked out. By
the early train next morning there was a passenger
who never wants to see anybody named Daly
again.

Recent instance of black-tracking. Beside
the water (a sea-inlet) stood a mortgaged house.
Mortgagee had threatened foreclosure on a certain
date, a day or two prior to which the house,
which was empty but insured, was totally burnt.
Next day owner directed police attention to the
indent of a boat’s bow on beach, and footmarks
apparently leading up to site of house. A black
tracker was put on, and he traced the footprints
to the ruins and back to the beach. Then he re-
turned to station and said to sergeant, “ Him
catehum quick! That him tracks,” pointing to
some footprints in the sand, where the owner of
the burnt house had walked across the yard about
an hour before. Result—owner awaiting trial.

They still debate
how Bendigo got its
name ; and, as time
passes, the difficulty of
deciding will no doubt
increase. The late
Richard Grice (Grice,
Sumner) wrote over 20
years back that “ it was
named by Tom Myers
(Heape and Grice’s
overseer) about 1841.
Tom was a bit of a dab
with his fists, and a
great admirer of the
boxer Bendigo; hence
the name.” And that
is about the best bit of
evidence available to
date.

partnership, to run

Adelaide’s tram service is a curiously anti-
quated affair in one respect. There is no central
control; the horse-cars of about ten private com-
panies radiate out of the Holy City, but there has
never been any serious attempt at State or muni-
cipal ownership, or at combining the whole con-
cern under one private management, and cable or
electric traction has never been seriously advo-
cated. The old live-meat force has always been
good enough for Adelaide —some wild humorist
has suggested going back to ox-power. And, on
the other hand, S.A. has, in its Betaloo reservoir,
the biggest, most successful, and most up-to-date
water-service south of the line.

The English Institute of Journalists has
at last agreed to affiliate with the Maoriland
Institute. The original idea of M.L. pressmen
was to get a local charter which would have made
journalism as close a profession as medicine or
law, and allowed the University to sit heavily
upon its chest 1 regardless of the fact that the
cleverest men in newspaperdom are those—like
Kipling -who have gone about with their eyes
open and made the world their school. As things
are already, few M.L. press billets are independent
of the Institute, and the privileges conferred by a
Parliamentary charter would have made it too
lordly a body altogether.

A Bulletin correspondent :
A yet unpublished fact in connection with the Darra-
hill murder has been known to many residents of adjoin-
ing districts for weeks past. Shortly after the boy Hill
was lost a local constable sent to the Commissioner of
Police a report, in which he stated that, as Wilson and
his cripple son had passed from Goodna to Oxley just
at the time the boy was coming from Oxley to Red-
bank Plains, he considered it probable that Wilson had
met the boy and decoyed him off the road into the bush,
and that, having effected his purpose, Wilson, to prevent
discovery, had shot the boy. The result was that the
constable, who has been long in the service with a clean
record, was ridiculed for his over-zealousness, and his
report, which exactly fitted the since-discovered facts of
the case, was contemptuously thrown aside. Had this
report been acted upon, Wilson would have been arrested
right away.

No mistake about Braddon being Boss of
Raspberry Land. The other day extensive
arrangements were made to officially open a new
drive up to the Springs on Mt. Wellington with a
glittering society function headed by Lady Gor-
manston. The Lands Minister, after whom the
new road is to be named, enthusiastically fell in
with the project; then he “ fell in ”in another
way. Braddon suddenly discovered that the ffite
was to be used by a well-known rival politician as
a means of airing his eloquence and his patriotic
authoritativeness on Beauty Spots at Govt, ex-
jjense. After that, there wasn’t any function
whatever. The weary Premier politely intimated
through the press that “inasmuch as he con-
sidered the mountain drive somewhat dangerous
to congested vehicular traffic “ (which is quite
true), “the Govt, had reluctantly decided not to
incur the responsibility of an official opening.”
Of course, there was much heartburning, and the
kindly old Minister for Lands looked foolish, but
the Boss had spoken.

“The lock-out of the lumpers was not a
move of the united shipowners, but of that section
representing Australian co.’s in league with the
railway department,” writes a Bulletin man
from Perth. “Paul Strelitz, representing the Ger-
man-Australian line, declared that his co. did not
want a reduction of wages, that he got no invita-
tion to the conference, and that he would not have
had any delay with his trade only for the com-
plicity of the railway department. The depart-
ment had blackleg-labor on the trucks. Strelitz
offered to put his own (union) men into the trucks
and pay for whole time, but the railway dept,
refused to put the trucks alongside. Piermaster
and district superintendent were applied to but
refused assistance. ‘We have been drawn into
the dispute practically by the Govt, who had no
right to interfere in the disturbance.’ ”

How the at-least-theoretical Radical Stout
and the Tory Vogel came to coalesce. Maoriland,
in ’B4, was in a bad way. The “ Continuous
Ministry ” had held office (save three years of the
Grey Govt.) so long that the country was weary.
The Liberals had not recovered from the muddle
into which Grey had landed the finances. There
was confusion and shuffling and re-shuffling of
Ministries. Meanwhile Vogel lay low and said
little. But one Sunday afternoon he invited a re-
porter to have a glass of wine in his room, and there
in quite a casual, innocent manner he began to talk.
He professed not to see that the pressman was
surreptitiously making notes. Lolling hack with
his eyes half closed, Julius poured his glittering
day-dreams into his captive’s ear. He had schemes
for raising money out of nothing, for making rail-
ways everywhere, for paving Maoriland with gold,
and for generally making the two islands a fairy-
land. The glittering, plausible Julius was talking
for his life—office meant life to him just then
and no one could talk better. The pressman, who
thought that he was really pumping reluctant
knowledge out of the great man, put columns of
Vogel’s golden programme in Viis paper next day ;
the country wanted anyone with a programme
just then, and the. glamor of the big forcible Jew
fell on Maoriland once more. A week before,
Stout would hardly have taken Vogel into his
prospective Ministry. Not long after, Vogel took
him in. He had either to join Vogel or stand out.

815 GEORGE STREET, SYDNEY
(nearly opposite Railway Station).
The Rakaia Butchery.
A man connected for many years with Maori-
land Railway Department writes :
The inquest on the Rakaia railway smash has resulted
in a practical verdict of manslaughter against driver
Carter of the train that did the damage. Yet the fact
that the intelligent jury also pointed out that there was a
lack of signalling appliances at Rakaia, that the brake-
power was insufficient, that there were not enough
capable guards (meaning guards of proved ability), and
that the stationmaster at Ashburton committed an error
of judgment in not warning the driver that his trained
guard Was left behind; indicated that that body had
a vague feeling that the driver was more victim than
transgressor.
The last person who should go to gaol for the Rakaia
smash-up is driver Carter, and if a jury sends him to gaol
for manslaughter it should see to it that certain other
people are tried for murder. In Christchurch traffic
office is an officer who draws a fat salary to point out to
another highly-paid gentleman in the head office at
Wellington what is needed for the safe working of the
section. And if that officer lias never pointed out that no
single-line station where as many as three trains some-
times cross can be safely worked without “home” and
“ distant ” semaphores, then M. L. should deposit that long
row of corpses at his door and ask him to account for
them. If he has pointed it out, and the great man in
Wellington has ignored the report, then he ought to stand
his trial. Also, whoever is responsible for the absence of
the YVest'nghouse, or some other system of continuous
brake, from M.L. railway system, ought to do a sudden
drop at the end of a long, greased rope.
If driver Carter was reckless, which does not seem at
all clear, h's negligence is as nothing compared to the
utter in lilference of the alleged management. Rakaia
station, approached from the south, lies at the foot of a
small hill or ridge, about 800yds. from the summit. This
driver ha 1 a tra : n of 15 carriages ; there was a high wind ;
it was raining and the rails were slippery, which
neutralised the action of the brakes; the man in the
van was only able to control the brakes on his own
vehicle, and the driver only able to control those on the
engine iiself. The brakes on the carriages could not be
applied ; so, out of 17 vehicles, only two had brakes that
could be used to prevent accident. The driver could not
see the station till he climbed over a ridge and looked
down on it in a hollow only 800yds. away, but the night
was bad, and the foggy, drifting rain obscured the view,
and there was nothing to tell him that the line was not
clear. Presently he could see the tail-lights of another
train through the drifting rain and thought they were on
the other side of the station. Anyhow, he was justified
in coming on because, if the line was not clear, there
ought to have been a man with a lamp to stop him ; and
he did what any other driver would have done—came on
and whistled for a signal. Just here his alleged error of
judgment came in : he should have had his train in hand,
and he had not. But perhaps it was impossible for him
to have it in hand owing to want of brake-power and
the high wind behind, and the slippery rails and high
gradient. Anyhow, a red light was flashed in his eyes
and, right in front—soyds. away only—loomed up the
other train on the same line. On went the steam brake,
the whistles screamed for van brakes, but the howling
sou’-wester drove the heavy train along the slippery rails,
and then —crash !
Had there been a semaphore signal at the top of that
hill 800yds. away, driver Carter would have stopped before
he cleared the crest of the ridge, and there would have
been no accident and no “ Rakaia victims.” It was the
absence of a semaphore that made the accident possible
and probable. Had the train been fitted with continuous
brake, in all human probability it could have been
stopped in time to prevent the telescoping. And the re-
sponsibility for the lives that were lost and the injuries
sustained in the Rakaia collision lies on the soul of the
criminally careless official who failed to provide Rakaia
station with distant and home signals, and the author of
the cheese-paring policy that has so long shirked the
continuous-brake question. And it rests with a jury to
see that these criminally careless officials do not make the
grimy driver Carter the scape-goat of their sins.
Maoriland railways are full of death-traps like Rakaia.
The most hideous smash of all will be the one that will
take place between Oaversham and Kensington stations,
just outside Dunedin This scribe has turned sick with
dread on wet, windy nights in Oaversham station when,
r giving “line clear” to a heavy train at Burnside
(the station on the other side of the hill), Kensington
(further down the hill on the s ame side as Oaversham) has
suddenly signalled “Obstruction” while a shunting train
ran out to Hillside (half-way between Oaversham and
Kensington) for empty trucks. And one night of hideous
SSKSTfe
nailed to stop the goods, as they had got a truck across
the line. I stood awe-struck for a moment; from the
other side of the hill came the gasping of the engine mak-
ing her last desperate tug to haul the train into the tun-
neh I rushed madly up the hill to where a red light
could be seen at the earliest possible moment. But
before I got clear of the platform she,came roaring out of
th e tunnel. I waved the red light wildly, the signals
shone red, but nothing but omnipotence could stop a
heavy train on that gradient with the sort of brake-power
they had. As she roared past all the danger-signals
I saw the white face of the driver hoi,ling down the steam-
brake, the frenzied stoker struggling with the lever-brake,
an< 4 the guard with set teeth gripping his hand-brake in
an a "°n.V’ °f desperation ; and I threw myself down (I’m
not ashamed to say it), and screamed a prayer to God for
a miracle to save the lives of those men. Down at Hillside
they heard the thunder of the coming train, and, with
one desperate effort, hauled the truck clear. As it top-
pled over 011 its side the goods crashed past them and
pulled up half a mile beyond.
That was in the days when M'Kerrow, Maxwell, and
Hannay were Commissioners. M'Kerrow knew as much
about railway management as Tub Bollktin does of Theo-
sophy. He is a surveyor by training, and was appointed
Chief-Commissioner because he had a most pleasant way
of saying “No” to people who wanted special district
rates, and unionists who wanted shorter hours and better
pay. Maxwell and Hannay had a brutal way of
saying “No ” that used to arouse political hatred. And
M‘Kerrow, as an ex-Chief Commissioner, is one of the
triumvirate who, for years, neglected to supply Rakaia
with semaphores and introduce the Westinghouse brake,
and is therefore one of the men more-or-less responsible
for the Rakaia accident. And this is one of the men who,
with Judge Ward, is to make what the Minister for Rail-
ways is pleased to term an “independent investigation.”
To ask him to declare that the absence of semaphores and
continuous brakes was what made the accident possible,
is to ask him to condemn his own management, and take
a share of the blame on his own shoulders ; and this
writer asks any intelligent Maorilander if any man whose
name commences with Mac is likely to do that ?

BILE BEANS AGAIN TRIUMPHANT.
[Fully Investigated by the Adelaide Advertiser.)
Diabetes, Rheumatism, or Bright’s Disease are
severally among the most distressing and danger-
ous complaints with which man or woman can be
afflicted. But when those complaints are found
to collectively attack a patient, then the patient’s
condition is a truly deplorable one, and one where-
in hope might be abandoned with much justifica-
tion. Mrs. M. E. Austin, of Exeter Curve,
Semaphore-road, Australia, is a lady upon which
the frown of fortune had brought such misery as
to afflict her in the manner indicated. It needs
no stretch of the imagination to paint a pitiful
picture of the sufferings of the unfortunate lady
during the two years over which her affliction ex-
tended. Added to her physical pains was the men-
tal torture which she was obliged to endure when
the doctors, by whom she was attended, pro-
nouuced her case hopeless. It is a cheerless
knowledge to have that your life is fast ebbing
away, and that your few remaining days are to
be spent in suffering and in misery. Yet this
was the knowledge possessed by this unfortunate
lady. But the most remarkable portion of her
story has yet to be related, and it is her thorough
and permanent cure by the use of Bile Beans.
Mrs. Austin’s story is in her own words, as fol-
lows:—“I contrac-
ted rheumatic
fever about 11
years ago. At that
time I was laid up
foreighteen weeks,
and the illness has
recurred to me
every year regu -
larly since that
time until two
years ago, when I
had a very bad at-
tack. At the same
time I had dia-
betes (a form of Bright’s disease) and hemorrhage
of the lungs. I went into the Adelaide Hospital
to be treated for the diabetes, and whilst in the
institution the hemorrhage of the lungs and the
rheumatism came on. I remained in the hospital
from the 29th August until about a fortnight be-
fore Christmas, when I left—uncured, and, in fact,
not a bit better than when I went in. I could not
have been worse and be alive. I was so weak that
I had to be lifted out of the cab which brought
me from the hospital. Two or three days after
leaving the hospital I had a very severe attack of
rheumatism. I was attended by two doctors, and
they informed me that I had Bright’s Disease,
which, they said, had been brought on by the
attacks of rheumatism. All the doctors who at-
tended me—including one at the Adelaide Hospi-
tal-informed me that my case was hopeless.
Owing to my slender means, I then gave up
consulting the doctors, as, in the face of
what they told me, I thought it would
have been useless to continue spending money in
obtaining medical assistance. My symptoms
were: Pains in tbe small of tbe back, a dry,
parched tongue, I did not know what it was after
August, 1897, to have a good night’s sleep, and a
weak and languid feeling. I continued in this
condition until the first week in September, 1898,
when I was advised by many friends to try Bile
Beans. I decided to do so, and accordingly pur-
chased a box at Mr. Rowe’s, the chemist, at Port
Adelaide. After I had taken three or four doses
(I took two pills at night and one in the morning)
I felt an improvement in my health. My appetite
became more natural, and I could sleep better,
and the pains in the small of the back began to
disappear. After I had taken the contents of
half-a-dozen boxes, the pains disappeared entirely,
and I felt an improvement in every respect. I
now continue to take the Beans in small quanti-
ties to preserve my health. I may state that I
now do all my housework and washing without
any trouble, and life is worth living. I attribute
the whole of my cure to Bile Beans, and they
deserve every credit. The neighbors can bear out
the truth of my statements. lam doing all I can
to induce others to take the Beans.”
Summer-End Fatigue.
Fatigue is one of the most common, and, in
fact, nowadays one of the almost natural effects
of summer. Owing to the heat, our blood has
become thinned and our systems debilitated, in
which condition the body is very susceptible to
disease. By reason of this state of exhaustion,
the body requires something to brace it up and en-
able it to repel the dangers which threaten it, and
to sustain the extra demands which will be made
upon it by altered climatic Conditions. In order
to do this the blood must be in a healthy state and
free of impurities. But before we can have
healthy blood we must have healthy blood-pro-
ducing organs. The stomach and the liver are the
two great blood-producing organs of the human
body. If aiiy impairment of these organs exists,
it must follow that the supply of blood cannot in
its purity or abundance be sufficient, and, as a
consequence, the body is made ripe to receive
any disease. This condition of the body is
indicated by a general debility, which is the
direct outcome of a combination of nervous ex-
haustion, indigestion, deranged liver and consti-
pation. The waste matter is not properly carried
out of the system, the blood becomes poor and
the complexion sallow. To remedy this serious
state of affairs it is necessary that the root of the
evil should be sought out and a remedy applied
to it with vigor. Bile Beans have been proved in
thousands of cases to be the required remedy, and
to be the most efficacious known medicine in deal-
ing with the fatigues and illness which generally
result from a long period of hot weather. They
act upon the liver and stomach in such a manner
as to assist these organs to satisfactorily perform
their natural functions, and when this state is
reached a supply of pure rich blood, and conse-
quent good health is ensured. Bile Beans are so
compounded that they act in a gentle manner,
and repair the waste to the nervous system which
results from summer fatigues, loss of tone, lack of
physical force, etc.
♦
Thirty Million doses of Bile
Beans
USED IN AUSTRALIA FOR THE YEAR
ENDING FEBRUARY, 1899.
The proprietors of Bile Beans have every reason
to be thankful for the great success of their pre-
paration. The first six months of their business
last year in the colonies alone showed that some
eight million doses had been consumed—an enor-
mous business in itself—but the six months end-
ing February 28 show that during that period
about twenty-two million doses of their life-giving
Beans had found their way into the homes and
hearts of Australians, totalling some five Beans to
every head of population in the colonies. In
the face of these figures, we defy any other
three Australian medicines put together to
anywhere near reach the sale of Bile Beans.
The reason for this great sale is accounted
for by the following facts: The Bile Beans formula
is not a carelessly prepared one ; on the contrary,
it is the result of long and thoughtful research on
the part of a medical man, an American, who,
after years of study, discovered a natural vege-
table substance, which, after further study, he
succeeded in compounding with other ingredients,
so that its effect on the digestive organism of the
human system is identical with that of the natural
bile created by the liver. Finding this then to be
the most natural cathartic obtainable, the public
rapidly accepted it in preference to all others, and
consequently the old methods of starving and the
use of pepsin and bismuth sank into insignificance
and oblivion. Acting on the bowels in a gentle
manner, Bile Beans do not in any way weaken or
distress the patient. This is a point in which they
differ materially from nearly all laxative remedies
sold to-day, as the latter usually act in a violent
manner, weakening the patient, and in many cases
doing more harm than good. Bile Beans have
been aptly termed “ a medicine for the people at a
popular price.” Many wonder how this remedy
can have the great virtue claimed for it and
still be sold at so reasonable a price ; yet the
solution is simple. Millions upon millions of
Bile Beans are consumed annually, and they are
manufactured in possibly the largest and best-
equipped laboratories in the world, situated in
Detroit, Michigan, U.S.A. In this establishment
only the very best of latest-improved machinery is
used, and this fact also greatly minimises the cost
of production. Thus it will be seen that through
the great consumption the proprietors are enabled
to sell this valuable remedy at a price that places
it within reach of all.
Bile Beans are an undoubted specific for bilious-
ness, sick and nervous headache, indigestion, con-
stipation, piles, female weakness, pale-faced girls,
irregularities, bad breath, blotches, pimples, dizzi-
ness, all liver and kidney troubles, dyspepsia,
heart palpitation, pain in back and sides, fulness
after eating, lack of physical tone, heartburn, and
that tired feeling. Obtainable from all chemists
and storekeepers, or from the Australian depot,
39 Pitt-street, Sydney, post paid on receipt of
1/1J per box. Bile Beans come within the reach
of all, and at the low price they are sold at no one
should be without a box.
Constipation.
Everyone suffers at some time or other from this
most distressing and rather dangerous ailment. It
is an irregular and weak action of the bowels, and
in extreme cases the bowels may not act for weeks.
In a case of this sort the complaint is very
dangerous, and a remedy should be applied im-
mediately. Women often suffer more from it than
men, and the frequent headaches suffered by this
sex can nearly always trace their origin to consti-
pation. It is caused in most cases by carelessness
and neglect, but in some cases it is brought about
by a disordered condition of the liver. It is,
nevertheless, a fact that when regularity of habit
is practised constipation is seldom found. The
effects of constipation on the system are many and
varied, among the most common of which may be
mentioned piles, sick headaches, debility, sour
stomach, humors, and intermittent fevers. Regu-
larity is the main thing to be observed in cases of
constipation, and, in conjunction with a short
course of Bile Beans, will prove very effective.
The early morning, immediately after breakfast,
is the best time to make a trial, which, if unsuc-
cessful, should nevertheless be persevered in the
next day, and so on until the case is cured.
Indigestion.
Indigestion is an ailment which may develop
into a most severe disease if not properly attended
to. Acute chronic indigestion is by no means a
slight affair, as witness the case of Mr. Samuel
Fisher. Attacks of indigestion in a more or less
mild form are too common to dwell upon for any
length of time. As its name implies, this disorder
is an insufficient action of the various digestive
organs, which prevents the food being properly
dissolved. In cases of this kind the effect is two-
fold : First, the waste part of the food is kept in
the stomach and becomes sour instead of being
carried off ; and, secondly, the blood-making or
useful part of the food is kept from performing its
offices. The causesmf indigestion are many : In-
sufficient liver action, over-eating, eating too fast,
and partaking of rich and indigestible foods, etc.,
etc. Constant worry or mental strain, or lack of
regularity, may also cause an attack. The first
thing necessary to cure an indisposition of this
sort is a thorough opening of the bowels, and a
complete clearing out of the whole digestive or-
ganism ; then the liver should be stimulated to
action, and regularity observed in everything.
Bile Beans will do the first two of these, the
patient must attend to the third. Chronic indi-
gestion, of course, needs longer treatment than a
temporary attack. It is well to bear in mind that
headaches, face pimples, listlessness, and a host of
minor ailments arise from indigestion, or some
other form of digestive disorder.

DEBILITY AND LOST TONE.
CURED BY BILE BEANS.
“I had been very ill for a long time, suffering
from loss of sleep, continuous headaches, and
sharp pains in my chest and between my
shoulders,” said Mrs. M. Peterson, of 7 Wool-
loomooloo-street, Woollcomooloo, Sydney, to a
reporter. I was so bad that I found it im-
possible to get through my household duties,
rM
r\
and was com-
pel led to obtain
assistance. I suf-
fered in this man-
ner for over nine
months. My
medical adviser
recommended a
change of air, but
that was impossi-
ble under existing
arrangements, as I
couldn’t leave the house for any time. I tried no
end of so-called specifics, but none of them did me
any good, and I might as well have kept the
money. I kept on getting worse, and the pains be-
came almost unbearable, causing me so much agony
that I could hardly stand. I can’t describe the
sufferings I went through, and I was beginning to
feel seriously alarmed about my condition, for I
was rapidly losing my weight, when my husband
persuaded me to try Bile Beans for Biliousness ;
and it was a happy day for me when I did so, for
I commenced to experience relief at once. In a
day or so I noticed a decided change in my condi-
tion, which was materially improved, so I natur-
ally continued with them ; and now, after taking
five boxes, I feel as well as ever I did. The pains
have left me, my sleep has returned, I can per-
form my household duties with energy, and at
times am positively ashamed of my increased
appetite. My f riends and .acquaintances say lam
looking wonderfully well. That my recovery is
due solely to Bile Beans there is no doubt what-
ever, for I have taken no other medicine. In con-
clusion, I may add that should you desire to pub-
lish this account of my illpess and recovery, you
are at perfect liberty to do so, as I know Bile
Beans cured me, and I’m not ashamed of it.”

“ Messrs Warner and Co. publish a testimonial
for their ‘ Safe Cure ’ sent them by Mayor Healey.
Mr. Healey swears by this well-known remedy,
and we feel sure that his experience will lead
others to try a medicine whose good qualities are
already known to so many in Glen Innes. Mrs.
Healey is not the first, by any means, in Glen
Innes who has benefited by this excellent prepara-
tion.”

“ Gentlemen, —I have often thought it my duty
for the sake of others to write you. It will be five
years next month since my wife was given up by
two doctors as a patient who could not live the
night through.
She had been treated for heart complaint; but
we afterwards found that it was kidney disease.
On Sunday when the doctors told me that she
would not live another day—the dropsical swelling
had then extended from her legs into the body—a
friend said to me : “ Try Warner’s Safe Cure.”
At half past ten that night I procured a bottle and
gave her one dose, then in about an hour another.
She said soon after, “Jim, I feel a little easier.”
I continued with Warner’s Sab- Cure, giving up
the doctor’s medicine, and to day she is a living
monument to its efficacy. The doctors and every-
one who knew her were astonished.
I have recommended this medicine scores of
times since, and we always keep it in the house.
If my liver is sluggish I take it as a tonic and
invigorator.
After five years I consider the trial a fair one,
and that it is consistent to call my wife’s cure per-
manent. lam well known in Glen Innes, having
lived here sixteen years, been fourteen years
Alderman, and twice elected Mayor of the muni-
cipality, and I am not afraid to sign my name as a
guarantee that Warner’s Safe Cure is what it is
represented to be.—Yours faithfully,

POLITICAL
POINTS
Dickson’s majority in coming Q. session
will be the lucky 13.
Ten to one the pious crowd will want to
call the federal capital Federusalem.
The black man goes,on disappearing. His
sub-protector in the S.A. far north reports for the
twelve-months 21 births and 45 deaths.
Six members of N.S.W. Assembly ap-
peared on the platform at the anti-Bill meeting at
the Town Hall. They filed in at intervals, but
the audience failed to recognise one of them.
Owing to the
proviso that the
Federal capital
must be in N.S.W.,
but not within 100
miles of Sydney, it
may get nearer to
Brisbane than to
any other existing
capital. No amount
of straining can
possibly put it
nearer to Mel-
bourne or Adelaide
than 160 miles, or
to Hobart than 400
miles, but it can
lawfully be placed
on the northern
border of N.S.W.
about 75 miles from
Brisbane. Not that
it matters much,
for Dreary Dickson
doesn’t know how
to grab at an op-
portunity like that.
“Honest Tom”
Playford, Premier
Kingston’s stead-
fast private and
political friend, will
stump into S.A.
Assembly an avow-
ed opponent of
many of Kingston’s
latest schemes, not-

NORTON calls the present Federal

waiting twelve months.
ably Council reform and State fire-insurance, and it
will be interesting to see to which side he leans in
the new Parliament. An alliance between Play-
ford and Kingston is now regarded as improbable,
and S.A. Tories fondly anticipate the ex-Pre-
mier’s accession to Opposition ranks.
Why did that Sydney evening paper turn
itself inside-out on the Federation question? Which
of the shareholders thinks he is going to be
appointed to N.S.W. Leg. Council? In a word,
who is the milk in the cocoanut ?
“ Ask the people first.” That is the very
thing N.S.W. Leg. Council declines to do. If the
Shellback paper believes in its weekly shrieks,
why does it oppose so simple a remedy as sub-
mitting the amended Bill to a direct straight-out
vote?
Subject tor historical picture. Want and
Salomons, the “arch-destroying-angels of Federa-
tion,” sitting together in N.S.W. Agent-General’s
office fixing up a cablegram explanatory of Jack’s
wire to the Cabbage-Tree mob !
THE MOKE'S MURMUR.
SOL: “ Well, this is a climate. I’m melting one
end and freezing to death the other! ”
There are big rocks ahead of the Q. Govt.
The Southern members, sick of Northern domin-
ance in the Cabinet, are reputed to be meditating
a rebellion with a view to a re-distribution of
portfolios. Mackay boasts two Ministers and
Brisbane none ! . .
Premier Dickson (Q.) wired to Premier
Reid last week, regretting the “ obstruction ” of
N.S.W. Leg. Council in re the Federal Enabling
Bill. That is the first time that a prominent
Minister of any Australian province has inter-
fered, by a message of encouragement or rebuke,
in the pending Parliamentary proceedings of an-
other province. Had Parkes received such a wire,
whether for or against his cause, he would have
suppressed it till the local Parliament had finished
its fight.
N.S.W. ex-Treas. M‘Millan boasts of
trusting to the “ Sovereign- People.” But ask
him what he means by the S.P. and he will
“ The people as represented in Parliament.”
Therefore lie professes trust in the people but dis-
trusts the Referendum.
“The Labor-party has treated me in a
chivalrous way,” said Premier Reid at Newcastle.
It out his tea duty from 3d. to Id.; wiped out
his coffee, chicory, and other taxes; and in the
course of every important debate manages to call
him a wriggler about a score of times.
The 19M’s.L.C. who carried the proposi-
tion that there should be no Federation in
N.S.W. unless the affirmative majority reached
80,000 votes, were an ancient lot and practically
all past their mental prime. They aggregated
1142 years, so their average age was a shade over
60. '
Obviously the Age is at heart no friend of
Federation. It has been forced to enlist in the
federal ranks by the action of its hated rival, the
Argus ; but it is protectionist-provincialist above
all things, and quite happy so long as "Victoria
can enjoy the N.S.W. market, while N.S.W. is
shut out of Victoria’s.
Arthur Rutledge, who again enters Q.
Parliament through the bungling of the local
Labor executive, has been appointed Byrnes’
successor as Attorney-General. Rutledge is an
easy-going, happy-go-lucky, well-fed ex-Wesleyan
parson, destined to caress a fair round stomach on
the Supreme Court bench.
Subject for speculation : when and where
will Cabbage-tree Jack resign—at Albany or at
Adelaide ? Or will it be at Melbourne ? Or will
King John continue to draw his official .£4O a
week until he reaches Sydney—so as to make sure
that he has correctly grasped “the particulars,”
and is doing nothing rash ?
Ministerial papers throughout Queensland
all pay high tribute to the organisation and disci-
pline in the ranks of the Labor-party. Said a
prominent Govt, politician the other day :
“They put us to shame. Why, we can hardly get
a J.P. to witness an electoral-form without giving
the man a fee of some kind.”
“ Lowles, M.P., protests against an
innuendo that the statesman who sanctioned the
New Guinea concession was influenced materially.”
Well, Lowles and Vine materially influenced
someone, anyhow ; else why should two such
hungry bounders have been let grab a whole king-
dom for practically “ nix ” ?
A few more such victories and the Boodle-
wraith will rot in its grave instead of putrefying
on its feet. Where would Boodlewraith be to-day
but for the brutal fact that only 66 per cent, of the
men of Queensland are represented by votes ? And
this on top of the fact that plural-voting has not
been abolished in the Land of the Leper.
F. B. Suttor and Premier Reid concur, if
one may; judge from a question asked and answered
in Parliament, in the view that N.S.W. Agent-
General should not be a director of any public
company. Right to begin with. But why not
carry the view into a Parliamentary resolution
and extend it to Ministerial officeholders ?
The rag-tag-and-bobtail character of the
platform support accorded to G. Republican Dibbs
at his Sydney Town Hall anti-Federal meeting is
accounted for by the fact that John Norton had
been selected as principal speaker. When the
Commercial Bank and M‘Laurin crowd got to
know that John was to figure largely they declined
to “take any.”
Significant that the members of the
Kingston Govt, all, with a single exception, repre-
sent districts so Liberal that the other member
is a Laborist (there are two members for each
S.A. electorate), or is almost certain to be
one. after next election. The exception is
Yatala, represented by Education Butler; and
even that is thought to be not quite hopeless, in
view of what the State Loan Department and the
Export Dep6t have done.
Q. Parliamentary Labor-party has
lost the only real and original thinker it
ever possessed—Henry Turley, ex-member
for Brisbane South. To those who appre-
ciate only the racy in political discussion,
Turley was generally a bore ; but, never-
theless, he was the solid bulwark of Q. Par-
liamentary Opposition. Cleverer talkers,
like Dawson, dressed up the facts and con-
clusions of Turley and scored heaps of
flattering press-notices ; but the hard thinker
from South Brisbane was the man who was
doing the work, raking statistics, drawing
conclusions and comparisons, and acting
generally as draught-horse of his party.
The godly towns of Queensland,
Ipswich and Maryborough, return Govt,
supporters, as heretofore. Wherever priest
and parson are strong in the North the
Democrat goes down. Wherever the
churches are in abeyance, and the voice of
the gaunt Gospeller is almost a curiosity,
there the Labor-men flourish and the Democrats
are returned to Parliament. Apparently, the
true mission of the churches is to set the workers
at variance on non-essentials.
The list published of members of N.S.W.
Assembly who, it is alleged, will declare against
the Bill only numbers 43, despite the assertion
that a secret ballot would reveal a majority
against it. The 43 includes Dick (who has spoken
in favor of the Bill), Barnes (who is counted
twice), Stent (who is not in the House), and
Mayor Harris.
Said that Premier Reid counted up to 193
gentlemen with wide waistcoats and narrow views
willing, to swamp N.S.W. Leg. Council for the
“honor” of M.L.C. and the profit of a railway
pass ; and left off with the list unfinished. The
rush of Tories who have suddenly become ardent
Federationists puts the Barron falls in flood-time
right out of running.
The immediate future of Federation in
Westralia depends on the will of one man—J. W.
Hackett, editor of the West Australian, bell-
wether of the Leg. Council, and managing director
of the Forrest Govt. Forrest and Hackett are
for once on opposite sides, but whereas Forrest is
a passive Federalist —not as Premier, as a private
member—Hackett is a fighting anti-Federalist,
and will probably persuade the Leg. Council to
prevent the Bill going to the people. If the
people get a word on the question, Federation
would be carried—as it will be by the Assembly.
LESLIE MACDONALD,
“Bobadil’s" stage manager.
Attorney-Gen. Isaacs says that the Vic.
grand-jury system, which was responsible for the
placing of Detective Dungey and his female
“assistant” on their trial, is a matter to be
earnestly considered by the Crown Law dept.
The same Isaacs saw nothing but good in the
system when it clashed with Bryan O’Loghlen’s
nolle prosequi in the Mercantile Bank case.
G. Republican Dibbs blesses Freetrade,
Labor-man Hughes defends Dr. Maclaurin, the
Domain cheers on the Leg. Council, th» Star
supports the Govt., Reid embraces Barton, Wise

helps Reid, and things generally utterly upset
The Bulletin’s pre-conceived ideas of N.S.W.
politics. John Norton is, however, agin every-
thing still, and the Cabbage-Tree mob is as usual.
According to Q. Worker, the Boodle-
wraith Govt, has at Q. general election really
gained a majority of seats with a minority of
votes. Total votes given for Labor and Opposi-
tion candidates, 45,837; for Govt, candidates,
39,753. But Govt, has in an Assembly of 72
members 43 seats ; Labor and Opposition only 29.
Isn’t this a tip for Labor to use the contingent
vote?
N.S.W. Leg. Councillors are an obliging
set of humorists. When the Assembly objected to
their proviso in the Enabling Bill that N.S.W.
shouldn’t federate unless Queensland came in, the
Council cordially offered to make things worse by
providing that N.S.W. shouldn’t federate unless
both Queensland and Victoria came in. The
accommodating nature of the old gentlemen is
something quite remarkable.
Eight lepers, according to Worker, were
unearthed in one recent week in Queensland—six
at Mackay, one at Maryborough, and one at Bun-
daberg. All in the sugar districts, where the
yellow and brown men are thickest. The Govt,
and capitalistic press did not think it worth while
to mention this, especially as the elections were
on and the colored labor and Asiatic restriction
question is one of the main planks in the Labor-
party’s platform.
Doubtful if Q. Premier Dickson will
manage to keep office in the just-elected Parlia-
ment. Many of the so-called “ Independent
Ministerialists ” are simply anti-Dicksonites in
disguise, and it is noteworthy that most of those
“ Independents ” are men who bid for more than
=6300 a year, and, being mostly bald and blear-
eyed, they can’t afford to wait too long for their
] *oi tfolids and the thousand. Then K. B. Forrest
lias the energy and ambition of MTlwraith, and is
a big cloud on the weather bow.
One of Premier Reid’s amendments pro-
vides that the boundaries of any original State
cannot be altered without the' consent of a
majority of the electors of that State. Some legal
minds argue that under this clause N.S.W. can
practically choose the site of the federal oapital
(always providing for the 100 miles from Sydney
limit), because, by handing over to the absolute
jurisdiction of the Commonwealth the area
required for the capital, the mother province must
of necessity alter her boundaries.
Two of the quaint laws at the pious island
of Pitcairn, where the women all lose their front
teeth :
No person or persons to bring coooanut orcocoanut*
from t’other side or any other part of the island without
their being accompanied by one of the authorities or
churchwardens.
No person or persons are to kill any cat unless doing
him damage. If any one be found so doing, shall be
punished by having his dog taken from him and be killed;
and should the person have no dog, he shall be punished
by the magistrate. Should a dog go out with his master
and fall in with a eat and chase him, and the owner of
the dog make all effort to save the cat, this will save his
dog, though the cat die afterwards ; but should no effort
he made to save the cat, the dog must he confined for the
first offence, and be killed for the second.
According to N.S.W. Labor-m&mber
Hughes : “ There can be no doubt whatever
that the proposed Federation will kill Demo-
cracy.” Why, cert’nly ! Of course the shortest
way to kill Democracy is to have both Houses
elected by the people, with one-man-one-vote for
both Houses, members of both Houses to be paid,
no property-qualification for members, a joint
sitting in case of deadlocks, the majority to decide
—as provided by the Draft Constitution ! ! That
Constitution is practically a copy of the Swiss one
which has made Switzerland the most democratic
country on earth, and which the Hughes and
Holman party is always holding up as a model to
the world. And now that it is offered to him
Hughes denounces the Swiss constitution as a
beastly engine of Fatman.
John Norton’s Truth calls on the people
to reject the Federation scheme because
it doesn’t provide for federating the
debts and the railway. So does
Sydney Telegraph. And yet the
maligned Bill, in clause 51, para-
graphs xxxm. and xxxiv. at
least allows the Federal Govt, to
take over all railways with the
consent of the States, which is
something ; and in clause 105 it
gives the Federal Govt, absolute
power to take over all the States
debts as they exist at the date
when the Commonwealth starts,
i which gives it every opportunity
l to take over =6200,000,000 of
| debt to begin with. That is
W to say the Bill provides that the
Commonwealth “may” take
1 over the debts and that it
“shall” fix a capital inN.S.W.,
And this section of the Anti-
Billious says that it should read
that the debts “shall” betaken
over to make the matter abso-
lutely certain; also that the
“ shall ” in the other case doesn’t
make anything certain because the
capital will be in Victoria all the
same ! !
Three years ago N.S.W. Labor-party
stumped the country in denunciation of the very
existence of the Leg. Council. Now, per Holman
and others, they stump the country maintaining
that the Leg. Council is the saviour of the people.
What a downfall had the Laborites been strong
enough three years ago to abolish that body 1

DR. MORSE’S INDIAN ROOT PILLS
Cure Sick Livers, Sick Kidneys, and Female Ailments.
l ~~ wm 1
LIVING WITNESSES SPEAK.
The Great Avenger Defeated.
THE BLOWS OF DISEASE (THE WEAPON OF MISUSED
NATURE) ARE PARRIED WHEN NEAR VICTORY,
AND ANOTHER LIFE IS SAVED.
(Told by Mrs. 2'hos. Ryan, Murrumburrah, N.S. W.)
“ It gives me great pleasure to say that I have used Dr. Morse’s
Indian Root Pills for indigestion and general debility. I used to
be so terribly bad that I could not move for days at a time. Other
medicines only gave me temporary relief, and I was hopeless of
ever getting well again. I was fully convinced that nothing in the
world would ever do me any good, and at last settled down to the
idea that I was hastening to the grave. I would prefer to die than
to go through that terrible time again. Mr. Taylor, the chemist,
urged me to try Dr. Morse’s Indian Root Pills, and he praised them
so highly that I did so, and anybody, by seeing him, can prove the
marvellous results which came through taking them. This was
eight months ago, and one bottle of them cured me, but I still keep
taking them, and finished the second bottle. I am now 56, and
feel as well as I did 20 years ago, when in my prime. I consider it
my duty to humanity to make my cure known, and anybody who
values their health should never be without Dr. Morse’s Indian
Root Pills.”
♦
Tormented by Disease.
DR. MORSE’S INDIAN ROOT PILLS FEED HIS
VITAL SPARK.
Mr. Vine is a well-known greengrocer, residing in Denison-
street, Kingston, Sydney. He has a few words to say about his
suffering and cure. “For some considerable time,” he said, “I
have had a bad set-to with acute indigestion, which at last took me
to a doctor. The pains would catch me sharply in the pit of the
stomach, and with such severity that when the doctor told me what
my complaint was I could scarcely believe him, thinking that
indigestion could never use a man so badly. His advice and medi-
cine, however, did me no good, and I was advised by friends to try
different remedies. I followed this one’s advice and that; but my
complaint was still as bad as ever, when I resolved to give Dr.
Morse’s Indian Root Pills a trial, as I had heard them praised so
much by many I knew who had used them. From the first dose
they acted very well upon me, giving me more relief than anything
I had ever taken, and I can recommend them to all who suffer as I
have done. ”
A Lady Rescued-
Bourke, N.S.W.
Dear Sirs,—Your Dr. Morse’s Indian Root Pills have cured me of
a weakness females are troubled with. I used the pills five weeks,
four bottles in all, and they have cured me. Formerly I was very
pale and weak, but at this writing the color has returned to my
cheeks, and I am gaining in strength and weight. Yours very
truly,—Mrs. R .

That Dreadful Schoolmaster.
EXPERIENCE, THE BEST SCHOOLMASTER, TEACHES
THE WELL-KNOWN MORPETH BLACKSMITH AND
FARRIER A GREAT LESSON.
(Told by Mr. John Tobin, Blacksmith, Swan-st., Morpeth, N.S.W.)
“Dr. Morse’s Indian Root Pills have so many friends that it
seems useless to tell the good they have done me, as there must be
thousands who have been cured of one complaint or another in hew
South Wales alone, but, so that others who may not know what a
splendid medicine they are, a simple statement of " hat they have
done for me may save them great expense and get them a quick
cure. For some time past I have been a sufferer from severe indi-
gestion, and I tried many cures, but they did me no good, though
they were greatly boasted of by the owners. Then I tried Dr.
Morse’s Indian Root Pills, and they thoroughly cured me. It is
said they are the best pill made, and I can back that up, as I have
found them so from experience.”
4,
A Deplorable Case.
TWO DOCTORS FAIL, BUT DR. MORSE’S INDIAN ROOT
PILLS SCORE A VICTORY.
Miss Maggie Ritchie, 18 Waterloo-street, Surry Hills : “ For a
few years past,” she says, “I have been suffering from general
debility. I was very languid, and suffering from dizziness, and
was often unable to do my work. I consulted two doctors, one of
them a most eminent physician ; but their advice and medicine
failed to restore me to health and strength. My deplorable state of
health caused me much concern, and I grew tired of life ; but
when I began to take Dr. Morse’s Indian Root Pills all this was
changed, and I felt new life coursing through my blood. I cannot
praise the pills too highly, not alone because they have cured me,
but for the grand good they have done to others that I know.
There is no doubt they are the best remedy to be had, and I can
recommend them as such.”
O’ershadowed by Death-
DR. MORSE’S INDIAN ROOT PILLS SAVED HER LIFE.
The following truth is told by Mrs. M. Mitchell, Carp-street,
Bega, N.S.W. :—“ I have been suffering for a long time from some
complaint, which caused me severe pains in the back and head. I
accidentally came across a Dr. Morse’s Indian Root Pill pamphlet,
and after reading I resolved to try the pills. I was at this time as
ill as I could possibly be and live ; indeed my friends thought I
would not live the week out. I have taken one bottle of Dr.
Morse’s Indian Root Pills, and they had a most beneficial effect
upon me. They have done me the most good of anything I have
ever taken, and I believe them to be the best patent remedy that is
sold, and I take pleasure in recommending them to the public as
such. ”

Dr. Morse’s Indian Root Pills
HAVE CURED THOUSANDS, AND WILL CURE YOU.
One of the roots from which these Pills are made is a sudorific,
which opens the pores of the skin, and assists nature in throwing
out the finer parts of the corruption within. The second is a plant
which is an expectorant that opens and unclogs the passage to the
lungs, and thus, in a soothing manner, performs its duty by
throwing off the phlegm and other humors from the lungs by
copious spitting. The third is a diuretic, which gives ease and
double strength to the kidneys ; thus encouraged, they draw large
amounts of impurity from the blood, which is then thrown out
bountifully by the urinary or water passage, and which could not
have been discharged in any other way. The fourth is a cathartic,
and accompanies the other properties of the Pills while engaged in
purifying the blood ; the coarser particles of impurities, which can-
not pass by other outlets, are thus taken up and conveyed off in
great quantities by the bowels.
Dr. Morse’s Indian Root Pills, a Perfect BLOOD PURIFIER,
curing BOILS, BLOTCHES, PIMPLES, SALLOW COM-
PLEXION, JAUNDICE, ECZEMA, and all SKIN DISEASES,
and a positive cure for SICK HEADACHE, BILIOUSNESS,

Biter Bit ” : Re Sydney Safe Deposit, a friend
of mine, going on holidaj's, got- even with an enterprising
burglar recently. He took his plate, etc., to the Deposit,
and posted this notice inside his safe: —“My friend, I
regret you should have all this trouble for nothing. I
anticipated your call, and have left my valuables at the
Sydney Safe Deposit, in Ash-street, back of Paling’s. Try
there. I have also arranged so that when you open the
safe-door it warns the police. Au revoir.” The latter
was bluff, but I guess the e.b. scooted some.*

they therefore push the sale of those on which there is the largest
margin of profit, and when the reputation and standing of one
make is gone, they sell another brand.

PROSPECTUS OF
Forest Creek Hydraulic Dredging Co.
CASTLEMAmB.
(To be Registered as a No Liability Company under Part 2 of the Companies Act 1890.)
Capital - - £22,500, in 45,000 Shares of 10s. each.
♦-
15,000 Paid-up Shares and £5OO in Cash to be allotted to the Vendors in full payment for the property.
30,000 Shares are offered to the public at Is. 6d. per Share on application and is. 6d. per Share on allotment.
The whole of the proceeds, less above payment and brokerage and flotation expenses, not to exceed £750, to be
placed to the credit of the Company.
THIS company is being formed to acquire that
magnificent dredging area comprising the
whole of Forest Creek, extending for about two
miles from Patterson Bridge, Castlemaine, to
Manchester Bridge, Chewton. About the centre
of the lease Moonlight Creek, which drains a large
area of rich auriferous country, empties into Forest
Creek. There is no private property in this lease.
The three richest diggings in Castlemaine dis-
trict were Fryer’s Creek, Forest Creek and Camp-
bell’s Creek, and the question as to whether
hydraulic dredging will pay has been practically
settled by the splendid return obtained by the
Campbell’s Creek Dredging Company at their
first clean-up.
Thousands of people all over Victoria know
what Forest Creek was in the early days, which
makes it altogether unnecessary that a number of
expert reports should be submitted. The vendors
rely on the well-known character of the ground
ensuring its flotation.
The large extent of the lease will make it quite
practicable to put several dredging plants on the
property.
All those taking shares in this first company
will participate in any future flotations, which of
itself ought to be sufficient inducement to the
public to take up the shares.
A complete hydraulic plant of improved con-
struction can be procured on exceedingly liberal
terms.
Starting with this large amount of money in
hand, and being able to arrange extended terms
for payment of plant, two calls of Cd. each within
six months will be sufficient to see the plant at
work, when it is reasonable to expect that the
first clean-up will see the machinery paid for and
the company in a position to pay dividends. The
fullest inquiry regarding the property is solicited.
Shares will be allotted strictly according to
priority of application. It will be necessary to
enclose amount of application money with order
to secure shares.

Old Carnage has indirectly given rise to,”
writes The Bulletin’s London correspondent, “ a ludi-
crous contention between the racing authorities and an
Irish owner. And thus it arose, and has arisen : The
Australian entire was introduced to a feminine equine
named Tenderfoot who has been a fair ‘plater’ and is
the propertv of Hon. J. B. Roche, M.P. for East Kerry.
To the foal that obtruded itself among the shamrocks
Jimmy Roche gave the most appropriate title of Bally-
bunion—after a seaside place in North Kerry. Straight-
way the ignorant turf autocrats, seeing naught but blood
and corns in the name, declined to register it, as Rule 15
bars curses, swearwords, or blasphemy. In much cool
and restrained—another straining wouldn’t have hurt it
■ language Roche commented with characteristic Celtic
calmness on the emaciated condition of the T.A.’s ‘jo-
graphee,’ hinted at a map of Ireland, and finalAd if he
wanted to call a horse of his ‘Gory Warts’ he would
call him G.W.—and not Bally Winkles. Up to now, the
odds are more than even on J. B,”

The A.J.C. A-utumn meeting started on Satur-
day. with fine weather, and got grievously bogged on
Mo f'9 a y- Affairs began with a gleam of luck for the
public. Kelso’s Wongy, favorite in a small unobtrusive
way, won the First Hurdle Race, and there was a faint
moan in Israel. Then another favorite, Merloolas, car-
ried off the Autumn Stakes, and Israel moaned a trifle
louder. After that, the public’s luck went to pieces.
Dewey, a 7 to 1 outsider, came in first for the
two-year-old Maiden Stakes. The favorite, Sirdar, was
only beaten by a head. In the Doncaster Handicap the
public put most of its ill-gotten wealth on North British,
who turned up about seventh, while Vigorous, the winner,
was an 8 to 1 chance, and the second animal, Hopscotch,
Carried hardly any public money. Vigorous, ridden by
£. fielder, came with a brilliant rush in the straight after
being a very unobtrusive animal all through the early
part of the race, and snatched the victory from Hop-
scotch, whose effort came just a little too late. Time,
lmin. 42sec., the slowest since Donizetti’s win in ’94.
The St. Leger broke the hearts of the punters
who piled their money on Bobadil, and saw the prize
scooped by the more or less obscure Johansen, who
started at 10 to 1. Bobadil and Lee Metford ran a dead
heat for second place. It was a great win by two whole
lengths, in 3min. lljsec. (Newhaven, in ’97, took 3min.
22£sec. to cover the distance), and the hat of Moses went
up in the air. Then al2 to 1 outsider (Tanner) won the
High-weight Handicap, and the public walked home.
On the boggy Monday the public’s money dis-
solved like a snowball in perdition. Dan O’Connell,
hardly mentioned in the betting, won the Flying Handi-
cap with ridiculous ease. The favorite got left in the
Maiden Stakes, won by Nuka. Reviver (second favorite)
captured the Champagne Stakes, which was the best
thing that happened to the public on that sad wet day.
Bobadil had been scratched for Sydney Cup, and the public
piled what money and enthusiasm it had left on Merloolas ;
and H. Power’s Diffidence, a 20 to 1 chance that hung
fire in the ruck of the betting, made a holy show of him
and all the other fancied animals. Still, the public got a
good run for its lost boodle. The time (3min. 31sec.) has
never been beaten for Sydney Cup, and only equalled on
three occasions—by Carbine in ’B9, Wallace in ’96, and
Merloolas in ’9B. It was a day when the winner had
almost to swim for his prize, and Diffidence captured it
with a rush that smothered all opposition.

Chieftain, the Moree horse which took first prize
in the trotting exhibition at Sydney Agricultural Show, is
the finest stamp of the trotting horse shown for many
years. He is a noted country prize-taker, but this is his
first assault upon metropolitan honors. He is by'Child'e
Harold from the imported mare Ella Chieftain. Mr.
Beckett’s horse. Bentwood, showed a phenomenal dash of
foot in parts. He is one of the best-bred trotting stallions in
Australia, and moves so much like Tuxedo that numbers
who saw Mr. Rivett’s little flyer last year mistook Bent-
wood for him when passing round the ring. Mr. Bryan’s
stallion. Souvenir, by Era, is a horse that improves with
age. He moved round the track like a piece of machinery,
and has improved out of all recognition upon last year’s
form.

As might have been expected, Dubbo Trotting
Club made a mistake as regards attendance in fixing its
Sydney Kensington meeting for Thursday last when it
had the Agricultural Show to fight. The sport was fair,
but, as usual, the trouble lay in the failure of the handi-
cappers to bring the horses together at the finish.
One long-bottled horse was let loose, but the good thing
did not come off. The country people did not bring down
any of the fliers one hears so much about, and Sydney
took all the prizes. Mr. Beckett showed he has a good
one in Silver Boy—a gelding by Era—who won the 3min.
class-trot in The most consistent performer of
the day was Mr. M'Millan’s Silverhue, who ran second to
Silver Boy, second to Dr. Slate’s Huon Prince, who won
the Wonbobbie Handicap Trot, and won the Dubbo
Handicap Trot from 4sec. behind in smin. 13J4sec.

Operatic Tom Pollard, who races ’osses in M.L.,
achieved a delirious success when Djin Djin (Apremont—
Dudu) walked off with Dunedin Cup, which has been won
by some notable horses, including Sir Modred. The
Pollard troupe were on to a man (and woman). It is the
old story over again of a dotty neddy winning a big race,
but the public tumbled when a stable-mate was scratched
to make the way clear. “ Tom ” won’t rest easy now until
he gets a Carbine for a shot at Melb. Cup.

Broken Hill police, after several vain attempts
to overcome the local Ikey Mo and the tote-man, hit
lately on the grand expedient of running in all the tribe
to serve on a Saturday-afternoon coroner’s jury. And, as
the subject had shot himself several days before, betting
was “ off ” for that day. Now the local" paper is calling
for tenders for a regular supply of corpses demanding in-

“ What price Wild Wave for the Hurdles?” He was told

won, and “ Robert ” drew his div., but I kept my wonder-
ing eye on him, and found that when the man in blue lost
he didn’t pay. Of course, if Ikey had squealed he’d have
been threatened with expulsion from the course.

N.S.W. schools’ swimming championship carni-
val came off at Fitzroy dock (Cockatoo) last Saturday in
the presence of about 3000 people, hundreds of whom
were enthusiastic relatives of the competitors. The
anxiety of lady relatives to secure an unobstructed view
of their undressed pet-lambs’ performances was pathetic.
The boys, their skins brown as acorns, all
showed signs of heavy training ; the whitest among them
was a little Chinese, whose nationality was hard to dis-
tinguish when his clothes were off. Australian manly
beauty runs chiefly to legs. Several of the adult per-
formers wandered around in trunks, coats, vests and
hats, and their beautiful brown legs were a source of
delight to at least a section of the fair sex. But the ex-
perienced ones didn’t seem to thrill very much, and
remarked loudly to one another that although the shapes
were “pretty right” there was a most lamentable lack of
hair, and one jaded-looking matron of about 25 declared
that the noble supports were “shaven and polished.”
There were several noteworthy struggles between
the schools. In the 4th heat of the All-Schools cham-
pionship for 13 years and under, Walford, of Fort-street,
had a great battle with Sims of Crown-street. But Fort-
street. had the muscle and got home. The final 100yds.
Public Schools Championship was very exciting.
Anlezark (Bathurst), Martin (Fort-street), and Byers
(Darling-road) sailed along in front of a stiff breeze with
their noses in a line, and right up to the finish it was any-
body’s race. Then Anlezark’s red cap got ahead. Anle-
zark and Byers also had a big struggle for the All-Schools
220yds. Championship. Byers, turning quickly in the
last lap, passed him and won.
There’s the makings of a champion in a 10-year-
old mite named H. Roberts, of Smith-street school. He
was second in the second heat of the 50vds. for 12 years
and under, and won the first heat of the 40yds. for 10
years and under. In the final 60yds. for 12 years he got
home third, scrambled out, darted for the starting-point,
and got there just in time to plunge in and splash home
first in the final All-Schools Championship (40yds. for 10
years). A regular water-rat, with promise of easy grace.
Ex-champion Wylie gave an exhibition of long-
distance diving, and “Turns” Cavill gave a fancy swim-
ming display. But the crowd was hungry for the big
contest between Bishop and Lane. Sporting bucks were
shouting encouragement to their fancy and defiance to
his rival. One man kept droning “60 to lon Bishop,”
and another begged the crowd to take him up at 100
sovs. to a rotten potato on Lane. People climbed on to
the piles of rock to get an unobstructed view of the great
race. Bishop and Lane appeared on the pontoon in red-
white-and-blue and black-and-white respectively, and
there was a great cheering. The starter shouted
which was Mr. Lane and which was Mr. Bishop ;
everybody yelled, and both men jumped. They went
away down the dock neck and neck for 40 yards, when
Bishop got his head in front amid great excitement and
offers of 2tol on the leader. And Lane never got level
again although at 75 yards he made one |supreme effort.
The judge gave it as a win by four feet. The time was
lmin. 1 3-ssec., an Australian record for 100 yards over a
straight course, and only 1 2-ssec. slower than the world’s
best. But the Association won’t let it stand as such on
account of the strong wind that helped them along. The
two styles are utterly dissimilar. Bishop’s mighty arms
seem to tear great holes in the water into which his body
is shot by his piston-like legs. Lane shears through it
with a tireless sleuthlike motion that in a longer distance
would probably wear his bulky conqueror down.

Swimmer Lane left Sydney for Melb. Sunday
night intent upon reaching London at the beginning of
the Engjish swimming season. Provided the climate
agrees with him, which is doubtful, as his constitution is
none too strong, Lane should leave his mark down-under,
for Australia has never produced a better all-round per-
former.

Frank Laver, the lengthy 13th man in the
Australian team, is a solicitor by profession, but is
attached to Vic. Crown Law Dept, and was formerly
C.P.S. at Melb. City Court. He is a brother of the long-
haired Melb. musician of that clan; was one of the ill-
fated Australian baseball team that got stranded in the
States, and he it was who wrote the history of the tour
which appeared at the time in one of the Melb. dailies.

All Darling’s friends support the statement
that at his father’s urgent request he intends to give up
his business and embark his profits and savings in farm-
ing. Darling left a farm to resume cricket about five
years ago, but his fond pa, who is wealthy and has re-
tired, only tolerated the cricket racket when the fact
that Joe was making money at it appealed to his “ verra
Scotch ” feelings. Only last January Darling seriously
contemplated standing out of the present team; illness
in his family was one of the reasons.

The League of Vic. Wheelmen has begun to
cry stinking fish, one member complaining that business
has drifted to the bad at the rate of £4O a month for the
last year, whilst another member remarks that “ the
whole thing is a standing disgrace.” As already noted,
the lavishly furnished club, opened with a flourish in
'97, is to be sold to the highest bidder, and the secre-
tary’s salary is threatened with an awful slump. Mean-
time, the M. 8.0. continues to wax fat on the profits of
the annual Austral meeting, which owes all its success to
the sight-seeing facilities provided by the M.C.C. ground.
To a casual observer there is no apparent reason why the
bloated cricket-club shouldn’t go right into the bicycle-
race management—form a sort of partnership with the
hard-up L.V.A., institute new Austral fixtures on the
dates now enjoyed by the M. 8.0., and boss the show in
commanding manner.

“Jack” had a night out at Alhambra A.C.
(Sydney) last Saturday, when Bob Wade, of H.M.S.
Wallaroo, and Arch. Hempstead, of the Royal Arthur,
banged away at each other, in good old British style, for
the title of champion boxer of the Australian fleet and—
what was probably worth a hundred times as much—a
£l5 purse. Tars, marines, and petty officers formed
three-fourths of the big crowd present, and threw them-
selves into the thing heart and soul. Both principals
were grit to the backbone. Wade was slightly the
cleverer, but Hempstead had the better physique, greater
strength and stamina. There was no let-up from begin-
ning to end of the 11 rounds fought. Long shots were
conspicuous by their absence, broadsiders being the
order of the day. The pair stood toe to toe, dealing out
gruel smilingly, and taking it unflinchingly round after
round, and not once did the referee have to caution
either—even when firing was hottest—for a breach of the
rules, while their mates in the auditorium applauded im-
partially. Ultimately, the Wallaroo champion had to cry
enough through severely maiming his wrist, and Hemp-
stead was declared winner.

Alhambra A.C. (Sydney) opening night last
Wednesday introduced strong man Wm. Pagel, who
played with heavy weights that bothered Lucifer and
Hajek, and showed himself away ahead of any who have
preceded him at the brawn business in N.S.W. He is 22
years of age, and finely put together, especially about
shoulders and chest. Last week’s show was Pagel’s first
public display of his remarkable strength, cultivated and
developed in Sydney.

Mick Roberts, a rod-in-pickle for some time,
went down badly before black Tom Mitchell at Alhambra
A.C. (Sydney) Easter Monday night, but Roberts got the
big end of the £4O purse, for while he was prostrate in
round 11—to all intents and purposes “ out’’—and just
as referee Sid. Broomfield had counted nine, the colored
bruiser broke away from his seconds and, bounding
across the ring, landed a vicious punch on Roberts
jaw as that individual was trying to rise. The blow
cost the darkey 10 sovs., for, instead of getting the
winner’s portion (£25), he got the loser’s (£l5). He won’t
be in such a hurry next time. The fight was a disappoint
ment. Neither boxed up to expectations. Roberts, a
clever sparrer, proved a rotter as a fighter, and shaped
like an old lady.

Rennert, the German Graeco-Roman wrestler
who has apparently scared Harry Dunn out of the arena,,
is an unusually fine specimen of physical manhood with
enormous chest-development and arms as big as an aver-
age man’s thighs. He is a handsome fellow to look at,
too, with well-cut features, large blue eyps, and a face
every line of which betokens a happy mixture of good
nature and determination.
There was an amusing occurrence at Golden
Gate A.O. (Sydney) last Saturday night. Coal-huod Ike
Stewart and Charley Weaner were boxing “ the beat of
20 rounds,” and things were brisk, with science cast to
the winds. For 10 rounds neither had much to boast of
over the other on the score of having given or received
punishment. Both went to corners much the worse for
wear and tear. The black had just sent for the referee
to say he was not going further, but Weaner, whose legs
had given way, got in first, and Ike secured the honors
and the fat end of the purse.

Sharkey and Fitzsimmons are not to meet just
yet, despite all the newspaper fighting. Sharkey wants
to wait till Nov. ; to fill in the time, Fitzsimmons has
taken on Jeffries, the date fixed upon being May 26. It is
said Sharkey wants a rest, and no wonder, as he goes into
the ring with the full expectation of taking a gruelling.
And he is seldom disappointed. Maher, Choi’nski, Jeff-
ries, Ruhlin, M'Coy, and Corbett bashed him about ter-
ribly, whilst Fitzsimmons alone dealt out enough punish-
ment to use up an ordinary man for life.

Details of the fight at Cincinnati (U.S.A.) Feb.
4, between Australia’s clever middleweight, Jim Ryan,
and Joe Walcott, the “Barbadoes Terror,” show that
Ryan fought in just the way that most people of Wal-
cott’s color prefer. Ryan refused to carry war into the
black’s territory, preferring clinching and sprinting tac-
tics in order to escape the negro’s fierce rushes. The
average colored bruiser is much less dangerous when
attacked than when attacking. All who have gained
decisions over Walcott did so by forcing the fight
viciously at every stage. Walcott does not like punish-
ment, and loses heart when opposed to a boxer who re-
fuses to break ground before his bulldog onslaughts.
Ryan’s apparent timidity and unquestionable unwilling-
ness to “get to it” convinced the ebon-hued one that
this vis-a-vis was not only averse to being hurt, but badly
scared by the fiendish grinning of his ugly opponent.

Jim Jeffries, matched to meet Australian Bob
Fitzsimmons in America next month for the world’s
championship, is the man who made such short work of
poor old Peter Jackson upon the latter’s return to the
arena. The “ Los Angeles giant,” as Jeffries is called,
follows, when not fighting, the avocation of a boiler-
maker. He can use both hands well, and his blows are
delivered straight out with tremendous force. Ori his
feet he is fast and can break ground quickly and neatly.
Jeffries is said to be one of the most symmetrically-built
of men, His measurements: Height, 6ft. tin.; neck,
18in. ; chest, normal, 43Jin.; inflated, 48in. ; biceps, 16in.;
forearm, 12£in. ; wrist, 7%in. ; waist, 35in. ; hips, 42in.;
thigh, 26in. ; calf, 17£in. ; shoulders, 15in. ; reach, 76Jin. ;
and weight, 16st. 31bs. He is a bigger man than sailor
Sharkey, who beat Corbett and McCoy recently—except-
ing in the chest and neck. Sharkey’s neck is almost the
same size as Jeffries’, but the sailor’s chest is nearly 3in.
larger. At lung-testing Jeffries registered 3271b5.—71b5.
more than Sharkey.

The latest pig-horror comes from Guild-
ford (W.A.) The local swine were smitten with a
curious mortality, and when 40 had given up the
ghost it occurred to someone to enquire into the
cause. It was found that they had been fed on
hospital refuse, including bandages, poultices, and
other abominations which, instead of “curing”
the pigs, or turning them into medicated pork,
laid them out with marvellous regularity. Causes
of death were carbolic acid and belladonna
poisoning.
The N.S.W. Royal Agricultural Show was a
brave show despite the season, and perhaps superior in
general merit to any yet held. The inaugural luncheon
was a fine spread somewhat handicapped hy the dry
speeches ; no orator of over 100 words, especially by those
who know nothing about their subjects, should be tole-
rated on such occasions. Good Friday was an off-day,
almost a Sunday (though there were 50,000 people pre-
sent), and only relieved by the excellent jumping of the
ponies, a display finer than that of the horses, always ex-
cepting the bright particular star, Fairfield, and his
runner-up, ’Frisco. Perhaps it would be an improvement
if, without reducing the solidity of the jumps, they were
moveable, so that when the take-off became too cut-up
to be safe they could be placed on fresh ground. A
feature of the horse division was the sister to Correy—
Novelette—and her baby son by imp. Haut Brion, a pair to
be looked at. A grand exhibit, also by Mr. S. Hordern,
was his pair of upstanding bay carriage horses, which you
might readily imagine were straight from Rotten Row.
Another sight worth seeing was the style in which that
good but excitable little fellow “ Pippo,” was mounted
and ridden. Yet another prominent feature, but this
time a very indifferent one, was the alleged-buck-jumper
riding. Probably the long-haired, long-limbed Texan is a
good horseman —he sits like one—but his chosen Rosinante
was all too tame to show him (or throw him) off. Fair-
field, the champion of champions, has once again been
successful over the big jumps (this time carrying 15st).
A practice that must be stopped, or it will yet lead to
terrible accident, is that of permitting racing
trotters (or any horses) to extend themselves, some
going left and some right-handed round the ring;
also, that equally-bad fashion of putting on spurts
whilst the parade ground is crowded with all manner of
vehicles. The judging in the horse section, taken all
round, was most satisfactory, though at times bordering
on the monotonous —it was so slow. Want of punctuality
in parades and jumping contests was only too noticeable.
Some reliable person should take this responsibility off
the over-worked secretary’s hands, The water-jump
should be a separate item and not, attached to a timber
contest. There should in this event be a first and second
prize for the horses that clear the water best, quite inde-
pendent of length of jump. As it stands at present, a
horse might jump almost into the middle of the water, but
having taken-off a long way back he might still have made
the longest jump and thus become the winner. The
“Champion Coacher ” Freedom is well named, freedom be-
ing noticeable in every movement of this fine horse. There
were some high-class Arabs, of a kind likely to improve
our horses in point of quality, soundness of feet and con-
stitution. Many veteran breeders are firm (and justly
so) in their belief that it was the admixture of Arabian
blood that made our old-time journey horses so famous.
Cattle and pigs were shown of very high merit, but sheep
are a back, almost a missing, number. A splendid gather-
ing of exhibits and sightseers—a goodly shilling’s-worth,
evidently highly appreciated.

13 CLARKE, Esq., a merchant, of Geelong, writes to
Mr. S. A. PALMER, agent-general for VITA-
DATIO, 45-47 Bourke-street, Melbourne, as follows :
“Ryrie-street, Geelong, March IC, 1899.
“ I have suffered for years from that terrible disease
ECZEMA. I was persuaded (after considerable hesi-
tancy) by a friend of mine, who had heard of the
wonderful cures in New Zealand by Vitadatio, to give
‘Webber’s VITADATIO’ atrial. I sent to Melbourne
for six large bottles, and, when I had finished them,
thought I was cured, and discontinued its use, but the
trouble returned, and I thought ‘ VITADATIO ’ is not a
cure for my trouble anyway. I explained my case to
Mr. Palmer, and he urged me to take some more 1 VITA-
DATIO.’ I made a fresh start, took about another 12
bottles (large size), and am thankful to say I am
thoroughly cured, and have been so for fully eight
months, and think VITADATIO is a wonderful remedy
for blood diseases. I am 70 YEARS of AGE, and a
medicine that will cure a man at my time of life is
surely a wonderful discovery. I was speaking to a
gentleman—a friend—who had suffered from ‘Piles’
(Hemorrhoids) for over 14 years. He joyfully told me
he was quite cured after taking 12 large bottles of VITA-
DATIO, but he is unwilling his name should appear,
but said I was at liberty to refer any sufferer to him.
He is well known and highly respected in this town.
“ I am, yours sincerely, R. CLARKE, J.P.
ANOTHER CASE OF INTERNAL COMPLAINT.
SUFFERER FOR 13 YEARS TOTALLY PROSTRATED.
Mrs. COLEMAN, of Lee-street, North Carlton, suffer-
ing from Bladder and Kidney Trouble for many years,
stated, unable to move without the most intense agony,
but'a course of VITADATIO has undoubtedly saved her
life and enabled her to get about—a thing that neither
she nor her friends ever expected her to have the hap-
piness of. Mrs. Coleman speaks in the highest terms
of the blessing she has received, and will only be too
glad to enumerate her case to any lady or gentleman
Sir. Palmer may choose to send. Her case is one of in-
terest both to the public and the medical profession, as
a proof of what VITADATIO can do. Call at the
VITADATIO INSTITUTE, and judge for yourself.

295 Victoria-street, West Melbourne.
I was living at 378 Napier-street, Fitzroy, and for a
considerable time had been ill off and on, but I was
taken seriously ill on the 17rh December, 1898, and, on
one of the leading doctors of Fitzroy being called in, he
said that I was in a terrible state with inflammation of
the liver and kidneys, and to add to my trouble a lar«-e
lump had formed, which he said was either a cancer or
a tumor, and that I was in such a state that I must be
operated on at once. A friend of mine, hearing this
came to see me and advised me to try VITADATIO, and
I thank God that I did, for, after taking five bottles, I
became quite a new woman, the lump having entirely
disappeared, and I have not had any return of the pain
since. I will be most pleased to give any further in-
formation at my present address, and can give refer-
ences as to the miraculous cure effected from leading
business people, and the clergyman who kindly visited
me during my very severe- illness.
i am, yours gratefully, E. BROWN.

On the selection of firemen :
Dear Bulletin.—lie “Jack Shay’s” protest (8.,
14/l/’99) against the fire brigades’ notion that sailors are
the fittest men for scaffold and ladder work. It has been
so completely proved that sailors do make the best fire-
men that the London fire brigades are made up wholly of
seamen. Being used to standing on tall scaffolds proves
nothing. Why sailors make the best firemen is that they
are used to facing dangers of various kinds ; in fact, their
whole life at sea is such that no danger can take them
wholly by surprise ; consequently they are, as it were,
“ educated ”in risk. Your average painter will, perhaps,
think nothing of mounting a tall scaffold, but it is a very
different thing to mount the same height with hook and
ladder, with fire bursting through every window around
him. How many painters would venture up a scaffold
swinging and pitching in all directions in a black, howl-
ing gale V They are simply not used to it, whereas Jack
has to go aloft in all sorts of weather, night or day. Pic-
ture him reefing topsails off the Horn in winter 1 Ship
plunging, gale howling, nothing between him and death
but the foot-rope and beckets, with the chance of being
knocked overboard any moment by a blow from the sail.
Thus does Jack get used to facing, almost daily, dangers
which the average painter would not face once in a life-
time, and thus also do the fire brigades know particularly
well what they’re about in their selection of men.—

THE! AUSTRALIAN GEM TRADE.
H. Newmanj the well-known jeweller of 175
Elizabeth-street, Melbourne, is the largest buyer
of opal in Australia, and opal miners will find it
to their advantage to send their opal direct to
him. The firm has a reputation for straight deal-
ing extending over a period of 40 years, which is
a sufficient guarantee to consignors that they will
be honorably treated. H. Newman is also a
buyer of all other Australian gems.*
The organ-grinder claimant to the almost
barren Poulett title is not going to have it all his
own way. The old legal maxim, Pater est quern,
nuptioe demonstrant —a child born in wedlock is
the husband’s offspring—which is sure to be
trotted out in the Poulett trial, has been set aside
four times already this century. First in the
Knollys’ claim to the earldom of Banbury. Next
in 1821 Lord Gardner succeeded in setting aside
the title’s descent to a reputed son of his father by
the first wife. The elder Gardner was born in
Dec., 1802, but as his supposed father had not
seen his wife from Jan. BO to July 10 of that year
it was decided that it was impossible for a birth
in Dec. to arise from cohabitation after July 10 or
before Jan. 30—be., in 151 or in 308 days. The
law’s extreme limit is 208 days. (The Poulett
claimant’s birth was 175 days after the marriage.)
No. 3 was the Lord Saye and Sele case, in which
the wife’s lover frankly admitted the paternity ;
and No. 4 was the Earldom of Aylesford claim in
’B5. On Nov. 4, ’Bl, the Countess of Aylesford
bore a son, but as the Earl happened to have been
in America for at least a year previous to the
birth, when he died, Parliament upset the succes-
sion and passed it on to the deceased Earl’s brother,
the present holder. Parliament also has gone
further; in the Earldom of Macclesfield and in
the Marquisate of Townsend cases it passed an
Act dissolving the marriages and delegitimatising
the children thereof. In France, a child is the
husband’s legitimate offspring if born after 180
days from the earliest possible date of cohabita-
tion by the husband. This is roughly six lunar
months.

SURPRISING CURES AFTER YEARS

Bayswater, Sydney, October, 1898.
W. H. Malyon, Esq., Man. Chemist, Ballarat.
Dear Sir,—For years past (about ten), I have been
troubled with “ Acne ” in its worst form, and have sought
advice from the best Australian and London doctors, with
only fair results. A Victorian friend of mine, some four
or five weeks ago, sent me a tin of your “Ligmolliene,”
and speaking very highly of its wonderful curative powers.
I naturally took same “ Cum Grano Salis,” and was in-
clined not to use it ; eventually I tried your ointment
with truly marvellous results, and am now entirely cured;
and think people who suffer from skin diseases are greatly
indebted to you for your wonderful remedy. I shall
advise all my friends with skin troubles to use same.
Wishing ‘ ‘ Ligomolliene ” all the success it richly deserves,
Yours faithfully, GEORGE J. O’REGAN.
WHAT THE DOCTORS SAY
Doveton-street, Ballarat,
My dear Mr. Malyon,— August 21st, 1898.
With great pleasure I now sit down to record progress
with regard to my old enemy, “ Eczema Capitis,” from
which I suffered, notwithstanding constant treatment for
some years under the prescription of Professor M'Call
Anderson and other eminent dermatologists, with only
partial and temporary relief. When I met you I com-
menced somewhat sceptically your ointment Ligmolliene,
and after about two months’ treatment I may honestly say
my enemy is defeated, and I am perfectly well. I will only
add that since I commenced the treatment of myself I have
prescribed it to others, and am still doing so with brilliant
results. Please accept my hearty thanks, and remainyours

your remedies have cured me.
I suffered great agony with WEAK NERVES and
RHEUMATICS, and I sent for some of your ALFALINE

as well as I could wish, although it is two vears ago.
I also tried your ALFALINE UNIVERSAL PILLS,
which completely cleared my skin and purified my blood,
and I am now using your ALFALINE HAIR RESTORER,
which has thoroughly cleaned the scalp and made the
hair grow again, and it has gradually turned the hair
from being grey to that of its original color. I have also
recommended your Remedies for a number of different
complaints and I have never known them to fail, but to
do all that was claimed for them. I have great pleasure
to recommend these remedies to all sufferers, as I know
they can be depended on.
You are at liberty to publish this as well as my photo.

i Whereas I suffered severely from a very troublesome
affection of the NERVES, which affected me so much that

several doctors and many remedies, but all of no avail.
Whereas I, as a last hope, obtained some of Herr Rass-

which I hereby solemnly and sincerely declare COM-
PLETELY CURED ME within a few weeks, and although
this is over five years ago I have remained well ever since.
The ALFALINE PILLS also cured my wife, and I make
this solemn declaration conscientiously believing the same
to be true.

THE ARALUEN VALLEY GOLD DREDGING COMPANY is formed for the purpose of acquiring and working
certain valuable Properties by ihe New Zealand method of Bucket-Dredging.
The group of properties, comprising about 190 acres, which has already been secured for this Company by the
Promoters, is in the Araluen Valley, and is KNOWN TO CONTAIN RICH DEPOSITS OF GOLD, IN MAKY
PLACES UNTOUCHED.
For want of proper appliances to cope with the influx of water THE BOTTOM, W’HERE ALL THE WASHING
WAS DONE AND THE RICHEST GOLD WAS FOUND, HAS BEEN VERY LITTLE WORKED. This can only
be reached by the Bucket Dredge, or some similar modern method.
It will be seen by the Reports that from portions of this ground, in the old days, when Araluen was a famous
Alluvial Field, and when the primitive methods then adopted" lost much of the gold, THE CLAIM HOLDERS,
WHOSE RECORDS ARE NOW AVAILABLE, AND WHO WERE THEN WORKING UPON THE COMPANY’S
AREA, TOOK OUT 73,781 OUNCES OF GOLD IN LESS THAN THREE YEARS !
EARLY APPLICATION IS ADVISED. Prospectuses, Reports, and Plans on application to the Brokers.

COUGHS, COLDS on the CHEST,
BRONCHITIS & ASTHMA
Rapidly Cured by
Hearne’s Bronchitis Cure.
Those who have taken this medicine are amazed at its
wonderful influence. Sufferers from any form of bron-
chitis, distressing cough, difficulty in breathing, hoarse-
ness, pain or soreness in the chest, experience delightful
and immediate relief, and to those who are subject to
colds on the chest it is invaluable, as it effects a complete
cure. It is most comforting in allaying tickling and irri-
tation in the throat, and giving strength to the voice, and
it never allows a cough or asthma to become chronic. No
house should be without it, as, taken at the beginning, a
dose is generally sufficient, and a complete cure is certain.
“ Mr. W. G. HEARNE.—Dear Sir, —I had a bad attack
of Bronchitis for six months, with dreadful hacking cough
day and night and great quantity of phlegm. Night
sweats came on and pains in my chest, and I got so weak
that I could not leave my bed. At this stage I was pro-
nounced to be in consumption. I had a lot of medicines
of different kinds, but nothing did me any good until,
reading in the Age of your ‘ Bronchitis Cure,’ I got a
bottle, and after taking two doses I was much improved.
After taking two bottles the cough and night sweats left
me, my appetite returned, and I was able to get up ; and
am now in good health, for which I am truly grateful, and
shall recommend your Medicine to all my friends.—Yours
truly, E. SMITH, Halpin Park, Nhill, Victoria.”
“ After suffering from asthma until I was 17 years old,
and having been under a great many different treatments,
without benefit, I was induced to try Hearne’s Medicine
for Asthma. After taking three bottles of this medicine,
I quite got rid of the Asthma, and since then, which was
in the beginning of 1883, 14 years ago, I have not had the
slightest return of it. The Medicine quite cure me, and
I have much pleasure in recommending it. —ALEX. J.
ANDERSON, Geelong, Victoria.”
“We, the undersigned, have had occasion to obtain
Hearne’s Bronchitis Cure, and we certify that it was per-
fectly and rapidly successful under circumstances which
undoubtedly prove its distinct healing power.” Signed by
the Rev. John Sinclair, Myers-street, Geelong, and 59

With an ordinary tape measure determine the width
round the joints AA, round the instep 88, round heel CC,
round the ankle DD ; next ascertain the length and width
of tread by placing the foot on a sheet of paper, and
running a lead pencil round the heel and toes. Cut the
outline thus made with a scissors, and enclose with the
other measurements, stating what size you generally take,
what are your peculiarities—a weak ankle, perhaps a pet
corn, ingrowing nails, or a blooming bunion. All these
little matters attended to. If you have a long thin foot, or
a short thick one, with very high instep, send to ELLIS’S,

Weary to the
Tips of My Fingers
A DOUBLE PROOF.
THE CASE OF Mrs. J. BOYT.
(by our special reporter.)
Our reporter having safely made his way
past two ferocious-looking watchdogs to call
at the residence of Mr. John James Hoyt,.
Collins-strcet, Marrickville,Mr. Boyt opened
the door and our reporter explained his
business. “ Walk in, please, and I will
introduce you to my wife,” said Mr. Boyt,
“ and she will tell you all about her illness
herself.” In the diningroom our reporter
found Mrs. Boyt, who required no pressing
to unfold the history of her complaint and
its cure.
“ Indeed,” replied that lady, “ it always
gives me pleasure to tell people about the
remedy that pulled me through
A Very Serious Time.”
“What was the matter, Mrs. Boyt.”
“ I overworked myself. In addition to
my household duties I had undertaken the
care of a sick friend. I attended to her by
day and by night, till at last I got into that
state that I could hardly crawl over to her
house. At last I broke down. A continual
weary feeling was upon me, even to
The Tips of - my Fingers.
It required an effort even to raise my hand.
When in health I have always a good appe-
tite, but then I didn’t care for anything. I
dreaded the night coming. Lying in bed
was a torture to me, for 1 could get no rest,
but tossed about, wondering what ailed me,
and trying to force myself into slumber.
But the more I tried to go to sleep the more
wakeful I became. In the morning I felt
I couldn’t get up, and when I at length man-
aged to reach the sittingroom I felt too lan-
guid and tired to do more than sit back in my
chair. I became very despondent as time
went on, I got so ill. I can’t describe the ter-
rible feelings that used to afflict me. I felt I
would like to get away somewhere all by
myself, where I could see and hear no one,
and there be still.
I Was So Irritable
and nervous that if anyone spoke to me
suddenly I should tremble and shake all
over.”
“ I presume this illness must have pulled
you down a lot? ”
“Of course it did. I was not like I am
now, but was not nearly so ill looking as
might have been expected from one who
suffered as I did ; but then my complaint
was seated chiefly in my nerves, and I am
not one to show much change in my appear-
ance when lam sick. lam perfectly satis-
fied, however, that if my nerve affection
hadn’t been properly treated in time it
w. uld have ended very seriously for me.
As it was I got into an awfully low state.
My nervous
System Was All Unstrung.”
“ But you recovered from all this rather
quickly, I am told, queried the reporter ? ”
“ More than * rather ’ —extremely quickly,
replied Mrs. Boyt most emphatically. My
husband was very much concerned for me,
for nothing—and I tried many medicines —
seemed to have the least beneficial effect
In the end he got me some Clements Tonic.
I thought it would be like all the other stuff
I had tried—about as useful as a glass of
water ; but to humour him, or rather because
I wasn’t strong enough to resist his pressing,
I took a dose.”
“You hardly expected to receive any
benefit from one dose ? ”
“ Now that’s just where you make a mis
take, replied Mrs. Boyt. Strange as it may
seem to you (and I must admit that a good
many people hardly believe me when I tell
them of it) that the first dose had
A Most Marked Effect
upon my nervous system. I felt somehow
as though I had had something like a good
strong dose of brandy, and yet not the same
feeling as the stimulation caused by spirits,
for there was no reaction. I felt as though
my nerves had been stimulated and invigor-
ated. When I took the next dose I wa»
overjoyed to find that I was not mistaken.
Clements Tonic was at Work,
for I improved with every dose, and I
thanked my husband most fervently for
having at last found me a remedy that was
able to strengthen my
Weak and Debilitated System.
I never missed a dose afterwards, and im-
proved every day—was able to eat with a
relish once more, and could sleep as soundly
as a top Under the influence of Clements
Tonic I soon threw off the cloud of melan-
choly which had been afflicting me. I grew
lively, and was able once more to go about
my housework cheerfully and with a real
pleasure.” J
“ And you owe that pleasant change—?”
“To Clements Tonic alone. Without it
I don’t know where my complaint would
have ended, or what would have happened
to me. You ask my husband and he will
speak more strongly than I have done on
that subject.”
Our reporter then turned to Mr. Boyt,
who was present during the whole interview.
“ What is your opinion, Mr. Boyt, as to
your wife’s recovery ?”
“I give the whole credit of it to Clements
Tonic, he replied, and I can endorse every
word of what my wife has told you. You
could actually see that remedy doing her
food and bringing her along towards health,
know the
Virtues of Clements Tonic
myself, for many a time when I have felt a
a bit down or oixt of sorts, or when I couldn’t
sleep or eat well, I have taken two or three
doses of that remedy.”
“ With the same result as in Mrs. Boyt’s
case ?”
“ Yes, it always put me right quickly,
and I never knew Clements Tonic to fail.
Do you know that if I want a pick-me-up
or stimulant I would rather take a dose of
Clements Tonic than a Whisky.
It props me up better, and its effects are
more lasting.”

Colony of New South Wales, do solemnly and sincerely

Harriaon & A-ttwood, Sole Proprietors,


Queensland electoral laws were always, and
are now, among the most unsatisfactory in Aus-
tralia. And yet Q. was the first province for
which one-man-one-vote was really proposed.
The author of the phrase, “ one-man-one-vote,” in
Australian history was Gov. William Denison,
who ruled in Sydney from 1855 to ’6l. At the
severance of Morton Bay from N.S.W. Denison
spoke and wrote in favor of trying the experiment
of one-man-one-vote with the new territory. He
insisted that it should be one-man-one-vote and no
man with more than one vote, but astutely con-
ditioned that each electoral district should have
at least three members. The working classes, he
argued, would all vote for one candidate, leaving
the wealthy to elect the other two. These were
the days before labor organisation was under-
stood. But, anyway, Denison’s proposal was
rejected.
“ Sherlock Holmes ” outrivalled. Any
reader wanting news of a missing relative, or a
copy of a will, certificate of birth, etc., or needing
a delicate inquiry made, had better write to J. W.
Holdsworth, the leading Melb. inquiry agent.*
Mr. Frank Senior, who has been chemist
to the N.S. Wales Governors for many years past,
has conferred a blessing upon the citizens of his
country by discovering a wonderful cure for head-
ache. The new remedy cures instantaneously, is
very palatable, and perfectly harmless to both
ladies and gentlemen. Moreover, it is perfectly
effectual, no matter what the cause of the head-
ache may be. This cure, the result of years of
experience, can be had in 4 sizes, by post 1/4, 2/6,
3/8, 4/8, in N.S.W. only. To all the other colo-
nies 1/8, 2/8, 3/8,5/2. Beware of imitations. Only

[FOR THE BULLETIN. ]
Oh, all you happy lovers, who may acknowledge
one another before the world, have a pity for us
the outcasts, who must meet and vow eternal con
stancy in secret, whose love prudence or morals
forbids. Your path is so smooth, you sit in snug
drawing-rooms, and discreet coughs announce the
approach of intruders. Everyone smiles on you
and approves of you. We must descend to artifice,
strategem, and ruse. We advertise in the “ miss-
ing friends ” column, or hide letters in a log or a
tree. You run to meet the postman, and smile
openly and happily over love’s eloquence. You
are artless, frank, sincere. We —well, never mind
what we are ; the words sound harsh.
“ We loved, sir—used to meet:
How sad and bad and mad it was —
But, then, how it was sweet! ”
We meet by the grass-grown banks of a swift
little creek, and from the shelter of tall bracken
and rushes glance guiltily now and again over our
shoulders —at what ? A cow or a horse. And we
scarcely dare whisper as we presently approach
the homestead, and part under the shelter of that
kindly old white gum. Or away on some lonely
road, with not a habitation in sight, where the acres
of dim country seem to slip into the far horizon
under the moon ; the horses tied to the wire fence-
crop the grass, and the sheep, huddled together,
bleat now and again, and we start, fearing someone.
Or down by a cliff near the sea, the stars track-
ing a pathway across the water, which rises and
falls, and whispers a crooning song to the gleam-
ing line of sand.
Or the city ; poor lovers when it is the city. It
is hard to find nooks for lovers in the city. In the
big, kind country, when the night falls, we have
the wide miles and each other. Yet even the busy
streets become dear when we have trodden them
side by side, and the glamor falls over all that is
prosaic and humdrum. But the marvellous charms
of those secret meetings, the hair-breadth escapes
from discovery, the dear jeopardy into which Love
leads us, they are something you can never know,
happy lovers. Does not the very openness and
smoothness of your path render it commonplace !
Do you value the prize so easily obtained ? Do
you really know what Love is ? But what true
lovers have not believed that to them alone has
been revealed the length, depth, breadth, height
and vastness of Love ?
We used to think we knew it all; even though
we might not confess to each other, there were times
when we believed we had reached the perfect
happiness. Life had been cruel, would continue
cruel, but Love had given all, and you whispered,
“ If Death would come now ! ”
But he did not come, and it has all gone far
into the past, and we are humdrum middle-aged
people, and have not seen one another for 20
years. If Death had come then, it would have
been better. Poor lovers !

straggling J h lisfcen if anyone was near.
ld , Cfies it seemed when every step
W * oSt with danger, and each movement
was fra g deliberate caution ! Then across
r Sip of open’S white logs lay on the
and one lingered fearfully by stump and
tree past the clump* of saplings where sometimes
u ®ng a grave native bear ; the tall, pale grass on
either sfde stretching away m indistinct
waves Then at last in the shelter of the pines,
the dr'v ground beneath strewn with pine needles,
and the branches above murmuring a song they
long ago taught ships to sing at sea Perhaps the
tall masts were stalwart pines in their youth, and
can never forget the forest-song which sweeps
through the solemnness of a chant, murmuring
dirge requiem, lullaby, then swells into sonorous
peal and blast of mad triumph or despair.
One leaned against an old brown bole with its
warm, resinous smell, listened and started at the
falling of a twig ; across the quiet night came the
far bark of a dog, the whirring of a cricket, the
“ womp-womp ” of frogs in the dam, and blended
with all the whisper and croon of the pines. At
last you would come, your steps indistinct, a
moment of doubt, then coming rapidly nearer.
Then —well you who are lovers know what then.
What a soft cushion pine-needles make ! What
a still, peaceful world we looked out on from the
shadow while we talked of ourselves, and our love,
and the risks we ran, or did not talk at all mid
often that was best. The minutes that dragged
in a very eternity of time while we were apart,
were hurrying into an hour when we were to-
gether.
“ I was afraid you could not come.
“ I could not have stayed ; my heart was beat-
ing in a very madness of longing for you.”
“Do they suspect, do you think?”
“ I daresay. Ido not care mow.”
A light twinkles far off —it is the home of a
newly-wed pair.
“ Ah, my dear—shall we ever What is to
be the end of it all ? ”
“ I daren’t think of it. I only live for the pre-
sent, and from one meeting to another.”
“ Did you hear my step?”
“ Yes—far off. At first I thought it was only
the pulse in my ears, but it came nearer, and you
are here.”
* * * *
Well, it is all past now; hot clasp, passionate
kisses, clinging arms. Judge not too harshly,
happy lovers. We break our hearts, you see, and
must lie and play the hypocrite, and meet by
stealth ; and we try to do what is right very often,
but, though you may not believe it, there are cir-
cumstances in which it is impossible to tell what
is right. And Love is stronger than anything but
Death, and perhaps it is stronger than Death also.
Some day we shall know.
Meanwhile we meet by stealth, and some of us
do our best in a hard place, and some of us don’t;
and when we suffer we wonder vaguely why Love
and morals are so often opposed. Yet, if you are
severe to those whom Love tempts too cruelly,
you must also give credit to those—and they are
not few—who withstand, and break their hearts.
But, as they are probably broken either way, it
does not matter much.

MARS.
The Medium of Exchange.
[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
“Money? Not much!
That ain't my kind."
This is a story of warder Kinnealy, who is an
Irishman. All warders are, for that matter, but
warder Kinnealy is at once an Irishman and a
financial genius. The combination is not a
common one. The history of his house-furnish-
ing, truly told, is an object-lesson in finance, and
the trail of the broad-arrow is over it all.
The Briton boasts that his sovereign is current
all over the world, generally at a premium ; for it
is a coin containing twenty shillings’ worth of
gold, workmanship thrown in for nothing. But
in the community where warder Kinneally holds
sway gold is rarely seen, though money in the
true sense of the word is in common use. A
handy tobacco currency meets all requirements;
for purposes of small change wax vestas are always
available. There the value of a sovereign is quite
problematical, being estimated according to the
ease or difficulty with which it can be converted
into tobacco.
Dead Bird had a friend who did not mind carry-
ing money to him, but drew the line at a bulky
parcel of tobacco. So Dead Bird’s share of the
fiver his mate sent him resolved itself into two
sovereigns, and he was at once confronted with
the problem of obtaining a market for his rare
commodity.
The capitalist class was well represented in his
world, and he made his first application to a book-
maker commonly supposed to have a plant of
tobacco which taxed the holding capacity of a
kerosene-tin. The man of money had no objection
to acquiring “two jim,” but pointed out that he
was a long timer, and would have to keep them
planted for some years. Even then he could not
be sure of taking them out with him. The
offer he made Dead Bird seemed ludicrously in-
adequate to that hero, who refused it with scorn,
and went on to the next shop. He found he had
gone farther to fare worse ; sovereigns were a
drug in the market, and tobacco was as far away
from him as ever. Here he consulted the swine-
herd, who had earned the name of “ Partic ” by
dodging the weekly bath for many months. Yes,
Partic had a friend who would get them a pound’s
worth of tobacco for the two sovereigns ; his own
commission for furnishing the introduction would
be half the “ weed.” These conditions seemed
hard, but Dead Bird could do no better, and the
bargain would have been concluded if Partic had
not demanded the money. Dead Bird was too
old a fowl to be caught with such chaff, and
negotiations fell through.
That night warder Kinnealy spent ten minutes
in whispered conversation at Partic’s trapdoor ;
and, next morning, he conducted Dead Bird to a
vacant cell, with a curt order to strip and be
searched. After he had put him through some
gymnastic exercises, and examined his back teeth
carefully, he went through his clothes, and found
a sovereign between the upper and lower sole of
his boot. Dead Bird worked in the bootmaker’s
shop.
“ ’Tis well y’are dealing with an aisy man,
Dead Bird,” he said. “ Three months would the
magistrate give ye for this. Where’s the other
wan ? ”
Dead Bird said there was no other one.
“ Thin I must do my dooty.”
But the Drisoner was obdurate, and warder
Kinnealy had to retire with only one pound. He
was observed to make for the governor’s office;
and, as he entered, his face might have been seen
illumined by a new and tender light. Warder
Kinnealy had an idea.
Ten days afterwards the prisoner Williams,
alias Dead Bird, appeared before the governor’s
Court, charged with having in his possession
articles not issued to him by the Penal Depart-
ment.
Warder Gorman gave evidence that on the pre-
ceding Saturday he was on duty in the bathroom
of D division while the prisoners were bathing.
The prisoner Williams, who was having his bath
was seized with a violent fit of coughing,
during which the warder heard something
fall upon the floor. This proved to be a
sovereign (produced), which, in the warder’s
opinion, had fallen from the prisoner’s mouth on
to the floor. On being asked what he had to say,
the prisoner answered that he had found the coin
on the floor of the bathroom ; and held it in his
hand to give to warder Gorman when the fit of
coughing caused him to drop it. It had only been
in his possession a few seconds.
The governor said that, incredible as the
prisoner’s story sounded, he had reason to believe
that it was true, as warder Kinnealy had lately
reported to him that he had lost a sovereign on
the station. The prisoner would be cautioned,
and the coin handed to its owner.
So warder Kinnealy got “the other wan,” and
Dead Bird still languishes for tobacco.

DOAN’S BACKACHE KIDNEY PILLS
The woman who has to “ whip her-
self to every task ” is not a healthy
woman.
A little bit of work ought not to
tire a woman so. It wouldn’t if she
were a healthy woman.
There’s just the trouble. Seems as
though many women were doomed
never to know what it means to be
healthy.
The backache, which comes after a
little exertion, they think comes from
fatigue. Sometimes it does ; but. when
it comes again and again, it’s more than
that. It means deranged or diseased
kidneys. The diseased kidneys, instead
of filtering the diseased tissue from the
blood, allow it to remain. This c,i s
all kinds of troubles—Headache, back-
ache, irritable temper, dizziness, general
weakness. Will every woman who has
backache write us for a little book on
this subject ? It will be sent free.
And will you read what a Sydr ey
woman says of Doan’s Backache Kidney
Pills ?
Mrs. JAMES SHIELDS, living at No. 1 Holt-street, Surry Hills, says :—“ I formerly had no
feith in medicine of any kind, but was persuaded to try some of Doan’s Backache Kidney Pills.
I hey gave me relief, and after I had taken the whole of them I felt I was entirely cured. Before
this my state was miserable enough, as I could scarcely attend to my household duties through weak-
ness. To walk was a terrible exertion, and when I did so would have attacks of giddiness and
faintness. After sitting for any considerable time it was difficult for me to stand erect. I spent two
months in the hospital, being treated there for Bright’s disease, but to no purpose. I say without
hesitation that I owe my recovery solely to Doan’s Backache Kidney Pills.”
+
THE SYMPTOMS OE KIDNEY DISEASE.
Pain in the back or sides, Rheumatism, Gout, Lumbago, Ner-
vousness, Frequent Thirst, Hot Dry Skin, Shortness of Breath,
Troubled Sleep, Puffiness of the Eyelids, Swelling of the Feet and
Ankles, Loss of Flesh, DARK-COLORED URINE, TOO
MUCH OR TOO LITTLE URINE, Weight about the Loins,
Gravel, Disordered Eyesight and Hearing, Dizziness, Irregular
Heart, Debility, Drowsiness, Dropsy, Fainting Spells, Cold Ex-
tremities, Bad Taste in the Mouth, Poor Appetite, Bright’s
Disease, Diabetes, &c.
Please bear in mind one thing : DOAN’S BACKACHE
KIDNEY PILLS are not Purgative Pills. They have no action
on the bowels. Their action is on the kidneys, and for their
purpose are absolutely unrivalled. BE SURE THEY ARE
DOAN’S.
DOAN’S BACKACHE KIDNEY PILLS may be had of Chemists and

Jack Wilkie.—A True Bill.
[FOR THE BULLETIN. ]
The Hornby shows his sectors, seaward, landward,
white and keen,
But fails to light the darkness of the Board mis-
called Marine.
They are comic-opera sailor-men —they made their
biggest mark
And stopped their learning of the sea when Noah
beached the Ark.
They are dotty in the intellect—they stutter in the
skull,
They've lost their standing rigging, and they're
working off their hull ;
They're a joke upon the fo'ks'le —they make wild
amusement aft,
And they'd steer a steamer broadside, and they'd
rig the sprit abaft ;
If a ship has but a lazarette, though she's broken in
the knees,
They'll stifle the enquiry when we're sucked up by the
seas.
* • * *
By the staiths of the A. A. Co.—by the rattling
Plattsburg skips—
Where the coals from Earth’s intestines come to
freight the deep-sea ships.
In the taprooms by the markets ; in the bar of
Charley Lane’s;
By the Oyster Bank and Nobby’s ; by the scream-
ing Stockton cranes
This tale is told by sailor-men—a yarn of three
pound odd,
And how able seaman Wilkie went to sea to meet
his God.
The staith hath borne, the crane hath filled and
holdward falls the coal
With hammer blows that strain her planks and
vibrate to her soul;
They have filled her up for ’Frisco, the crazy com-
posite tank,
As leaky a tub as hogs afloat from Howe to the
Dogger Bank.
But filled she was with a sight of coal, and she
bent to her anchor chains,
For the weight of the freight within her gave
her several sorts of pains;
With eighteen hundred ton in her lap, and her
ribs and each deadwood knee
Cried out to each other to let it go and give the
coal to the sea.
And she cried in her pain as Jack Wilkie came
from the Quay to her buckling deck ;
And he said, “What a sight for a sailor-man !
why, I’ve shipped on a blasted wreck ! ”
Jack Wilkie was a proper man at drink or love, or
graft—
With thews like young eccentric-straps—and an
eye like a sunlight shaft;
He had lumped in the Townsville lighters where
the hot air has a taste,
He had sweated all navel-naked ’tween oil and
greasy waste,
He had trimmed—he had fired—he had held his
trick —for versatile was he,
He had done whatever a man may find to do with
his hands at sea.
And now as motherless and stiff as ever was sailor-
man,
He had shipped as able seaman on the coal-ship
Ghazee Khan ;
He had signed for a month’s advance note, and the
same was three pounds odd,
And in working off his old dead horse Jack Wilkie
met his God.
“You’re a sloven, you’re a touzle,” said Jack
Wilkie to his ship ;
“ Your stomach’s overloaded and you do not like
the trip,
When a waggonload at your forehatch knocks,
your nerves are moved to jumps,
And while the fulls and empties march your crew
is at the pumps ;
You’ve got no pride in your labor —and whether
it’s ship or hand
That’s got no pride in his labor—he’s makin’ for
the sand—
You could float home on your timber if you were
filled with Baltic deal,
But your oakum’s dead and spewing and you’re
sick from above your keel;
You’re tired of carryin’ over-loads—your repairs
ain’t been too free,
And you want to sleep on a South Sea reef an’ be
done with your walks to sea.
You look like a fourpenny Lizzie, and you
ought to look like a bride;
But your bonnet’s off, and the tops’l clews at your
mizzen are rove wrong side.
No ! You’re wantin’ an order to lay you up ; an’,
but for that three pound odd,
You should go to sea by yourself,” said he, “ and
not with me, by God !
But Circumstance—he steers this trick, and he’s
combined at me,
An’ he’ll take me down, an’ he’ll make me drown,
and he’ll laugh as I go to sea—
You may drink ashore, you may pay your score
with the pier-head jump and gait,
You may win from quod, by your fine, by God,
but you cannot baulk your fate !
An’ if I stayed ashore for fear of that Thief of
Men —the sea,
I might fracture my skull on banana-skins, or a
cart might run over me—
For the world is a great big shambles, and, whether
on sand or shell,
Every man must find the bottom slime, and the
decks of Heaven or Hell! ”
And he wrote to his girl at Ultimo, and he told
her his heart was sore,
And he said : “Don’t you fret, tho’ I believe I’ll
never come back no more ;
The Ghazee Khan’s pear-rotten, an’she’s makin’ her
funeral trip,
An’ I’m one of the hired mourners, an’ I’ll maybe
die with the ship ;
For I can’t desert—l’m motherless broke—an’ my
luck has set the course,
An’ I go down to the sea to drown with the ship
an’ my own dead horse—
For Circumstance has waited all these years to
make a catch—
He’s dropped me from the royals, he’s slung me
down a hatch,
And Circumstance has now combined—he’s forged
the final link —
And I die for the sake of three pound odd that I
squandered in meat and drink.
But don’t you cry, my pretty, maybe old Hard-
face Fate
Has left the final rivet out, and I’ll see the Golden
Gate ;
And I’ll write to you from ’Frisco, if so be that
we win in,
And if we don’t, my pretty, you’re saved from a
man of sin. ”
(He blackened himself as the man in love does
ever with sad delight,
His mottled soul he makes as tar, and lier’S
becomes more white)
And Jack was as good as they make ’em, tho’ lie
wrote “ I’m worse than you think,
I’ve seen Chalkers at Fremantle —I’ve been mad
with fight and drink ;
And the only think that ever I did that was good
and straight and true
Is the thing that is breaking my heart to quit—
the clean white love for you.”
* * * •
Past the Oyster Bank and Nobby’s the tug towed
the Gliazee Khan,
And she groaned in her bellyfulness like an old
and collicky man;
Her masts shook till her tops’ls filled, and the tug
had cast her free.
And she labored oilily along to the heart of the
open sea,
Leaving back at Newcastle wharf Jack’s Satisfied
Circumstance,
And the folks who’ve never been fft sea, mouthing
the sea’s romance.
Ten days at sea, and she belted on—queer choking
sounds arose
From her tortured hold to the listening deck, and
the breasthooks of the bows,
Floor, and futtock, and crossline —trenail, and bolt
and wale,
Ran their long agonised gamut from the rudder
to the rail.
Haze had followed the calm—underswell followed
the haze —
The sun in a dingy smoke had set for half a dozen
days ;
Like a candle ill-snuffed and smoking it glowed as
the dark came out,
And frightened all before and aft but the mate
with the twisted snout—
Practical, red, and little, the kind constant at
work and meals—
And he laughed when a sap-green comber stamped
aboard on iron heels—
A sea that was vagrant and friendless, but it
weighed two hundred ton,
And the gush ’twixt her bones and her metal
showed the damage that sea had done.
Under a goose-winged maintops’l, and her star-
board knees adrift,
While through her shifting cargo the waters roll
and sift ;
Straining and working off her frames, and the
seams mouth wide and grow,
And at every lurch they said that all of the star-
board side would go.
Like a man half-asleep under blankets, the sea
turned, rolled, and drew,
And rose in its awful hugeness to the ship and the
sentenced crew,
Long, winding heaves from the stale, dead sea
came slowly from below—
New noises out of the dropped mast-foot, from the
stern-post and the bow.
And, after the deadness, a small gale rose—’twas
nought to a well-found ship,
But it made the Ghazee Khan to wail and her
inner skin to drip;
Her broadsides plunged, and her sheets soaked
grey, and her copper gleamed the stars,
And she rolled her failing hull like a cask and
sighted the sea with her spars.
And her sweating pores gaped wide for the sea
that filtered through her coal,
And the men at the pumps ran an awful race for
the prize of the Life and Soul;
Windmill and hand and donkey, from the sea to
the reeking hold,
From the hold to the splashing scupper, while the
settling vessel rolled;
By steam and hand and gale they pumped ; they
pumped for the right to live,
With an ocean behind the smutty stream that
they sucked through their floating sieve.
The sea was behind and pressing hard in scorn of
their grit and gear;
And heaven was nearer than the land, and hell
was very near;
And, weary of struggle and worn with fight, their
strength and sperm gave out,
And they left the pumps to Jack Wilkie and the
mate with the twisted snout.
“Better to drown,” said they, “at ease, and
lazily yield our breath,
Than be water-blown after the work at the pumps
has wearied the soul to death.
Out with the boats ! Steer west by north, and
back to Sydney Bay !”
And lo! there were boats enough for some, and
some men had to stay.
Jack Wilkie stayed—he had kept the course—ana
the fate of the three pound ten,
And Circumstance and Hardface Fate, and the
scorefold skein of men,
Had hauled to two blocks on an oily sea, in a ship
all groan and creak—
The oak-wale crying for its life, and the growl of
the drowning teak.
They loaded the boats as the stars came out the
head of the Night to crown—
And the ship moved round like a full-fed dog
making ready to lay him down—
Moved round and round, and sank straight down,
as if she tried to kneel —
For her leaks were all over impartially, and she
sank on an even keel.
And her whimpers changed to music as the sea
took the weight of the hold,
And her coals slipped out of her cramping lap, and
the sea wrapped her fold on fold ;
Like a battered fourpenny Lizzie, sick of tramp-
ing the ocean streets,
And glad to be in hospital, and die in clean, cool
sheets.
• * * *
So West and North, the boats steered forth, and
brought this tale a-land
Of Wilkie’s Luck and Circumstance, and blind-
eyed Fortune’s hand —
The chain of Fate that was incomplete without
the three pound odd,
That sent Jack Wilkie to the seas a-squaring yards
with God !
You may booze ashore, you may pay your score
with the pierhead jump and gait—
You may win from quod, with a fine, by God —but
you cannot baulk your fate !

u I am anxious to obtain all the prizes and honors possible. To do this I
know I must keep my blood "and system in good order. For this purpose I
tried Ayer’s Sarsaparilla and the results have always been satisfactory.
“Training and racing make an excessive nervous strain and loss of nerve
force and physical strength. To quickly restore this loss of nerve energy and
power I have never found anything equal to Ayer’s Sarsaparilla. The Sarsa-
parilla keeps my blood pure and this tones up and strengthens my whole body.
“ Today I have the honor to be the champion cyclist of Forbes, thanks to
your wonderful medicine. I send you my portrait on my good steed that has
carried me with waving colors over the track.”
This is the testimony and portrait of the well-known cyclist, H. H. John-
son, of South Forbes, New South Wales.
Ayer’s Sarsaparilla takes out all impurities from the blood. It changes
thin blood into rich, red blood, such blood as healthy nerves and muscles must
have. “Ayer’s ” and only Ayer’s is called
"The World’s Greatest Family Medicine.”
All who are thin and pale need it. All who are weak and easily tired need
it. All who are nervously depressed from a warm climate need it.
