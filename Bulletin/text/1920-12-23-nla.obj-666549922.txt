American Universities
The frequent universities of the U.S.A.
seem to get hold of the people to an extent
which Australia cannot parallel. They have
publicity agents. At any rate, they send out
pressing and almost affectionate .solicitations
to all and sundry to come and, take a course
of something at choice, and they follow up
with chasers" on regular commercial prin-
ciples. If they don’t get the people, it is
neither because they haven’t the goods nor
for want of dressing the window effectively.
Also there are countless very rich men in
America, against a mere handful in Aus-
tralia, and they have not. like the latter, a
tradition of sending their sons to Oxford or
Cambridge. So the boys put in their time
at some local university—and their affection
and funds are at its disposal for the rest
of their lives.
Australia s universities even have as quite
unconscious competitors its big schools—
often misnamed colleges. An Englishman is
apt to talk more of his old school than of his
university. An Australian carries that atti-
tude much further. The American has derived
Ins umversity system chiefly from the tier-
man, and to both of them schools are a neces-
sary but burdensome preliminary. In fact,
one may think hard without recalling the
name of any German or American school
whatever. They exist, in great numbers, but
have made no mark on either newspapers or
novels. To which it may be added that the
American university catches its boy and girl
young, and gives them elementary eduea-
uon which in Australia it would feel in-
sulted if asked for. "First-year French”
(or any other subject) is quite likely in
America to mean the first year the student
has ever given to that subject!
The question arises whether under these
conditions Australian universities can learn
anything from American, and, if so, what?
Inquiry on the spot seems the best wav to
lind out.
W lnui Education looked round in Armis-
tice-time to see if she could glean anything
from the leavings of War, for the benefit
ol the countless English-speaking men gath-
ered in Europe, there was formed a tempo-
rary Administrative Committee of the Aus-
tralian Universities represented in the
A. 1.1. E. R. Holme was its chairman,
the other members being 11. W. Allen, of
Melbourne, and E. V. Clark, of Adelaide.
After various conferences had shown men
from different- countries what a lot of hints
they could get from each other, the time
Came to separate, and Ilolme, who is Pro-
fessor of English Language at. Sydney, got
leave to spend a few weeks in the U.S.A.
and investigate on the spot. His experiences
of two months just after last Christmas make
a volume published by Angus and Robert-
son, The American University: An Austra-
lian View. Midwinter must be an unfavor-
able time Ibr seeing that country, and out-
door life is little heard of in the book; but
Holme experienced the tremendous Ameri-
can hospitality, and was filled up with
figures and information —often combined
with a candid criticism of the speakers’
own local condition and a desire to learn
. from overseas.
The point that most struck him seems to
have Jbcpn that of business organisation. Our
. universities-get the administrative Work done
somehow, primitively; theirs are heavily
staffed with ’clerks, accountants and all the
proper adjuncts of a big city office. Every
Dean ,ot a Faculty is paid, and has a secre-
tary and staff. Also, with U.S.A.’s curi-
ous love of banding over supreme power to
an elected person, there is a president who
has “distinctly a wider audience than the
average Governor of a State or member of
the Cabinet; if believed great enough for
his position, he is as sure of a respectful
hearing as the President of the TJ.S. him-
self.” There was grave danger in the late
war because so many of these university
heads had received a graduate training in
Germany, and were slow to believe the
worst about old comrades. The whole local
system is based on the German ‘‘common-
school” idea, while the British has grown
<>ut of monastic institutions. Apparently
the Australian plan of having sectarian col-
leges in association with the university
would be unthinkable over there.
Holme modestly calls his book “a section
<>f a report which was to present a prelimi-
nary survey of a very wide field; it is but a
first impression.” Still. he was bound to
bring away some ideas for the future. His
Verdict is sphinx-like: we have "much to
learn, if little or nothing to copy”; which
implies, what he surely does not mean, that
the learning is only what to avoid. He
recommends a wide adoption of the hall-of-
residence, whatever it may be called (the
U.S.A. calls it. quaintly to our ideas, a
dormitory, however palatial it may be) :
women students, need more shepherding, and
both sexes need a quiet home where study
is not at the mercy of social interruption.
He would see far more of post-graduate
work, of intense specialisation which may
benefit the world as well as the student.
He presses for Federal aid, and suggests
what some people will shudder at. the crea-
tion of yet another Commonwealth set of
(Officials to consider the matter. And he
presses for improved business management,
for organisation such, as a merchant would
insist upon in any business half the size.
Two points in conclusion. Prof. Holme,
who has a neat turn of incisive speech, says
that the American university “is trusted;
its word is taken for its needs, almost as if
it were a patriotic institution like the Red
Cross or the War Chest.” Again, in a play
lately appearing in America, the hero was
in some doubt in war-time about acting in
a truly patriotic way. His interests told
against it. But then he remembered that
bis grandfather was the founder of a uni-
versity. He must not be false to such a
family tradition. So he ran straight: arid
it is recorded that nobody in the audience
laughed. We have some way to go in Aus-
tralia fief m> we' reach that standpoint.
S. TALBOT SMITH.
Beerbohm Tree
Herbert Beerbohin Tree filled a great place
on the English stage; but in the book of his
life just issued under the editorship of his
younger brother, Max Beerbohin, he appears
as a great deal more than an actor. In
addition to his widow, brother and two
daughters seven waiters of repute contribute
to the volume: and the variety of the contents
may be judged from the fact that these in-
clude Edmund Gosse, Bernard Shaw and
Haddou Chambers. The result is altogether
charming; for although it is'Maud Tree who
gives the intimate touch and gossips gaily of
all the struggles and successes she shared
with her husband, each of the other writers
shows a different phase of the man and
brings out something more of his personality.
Any man who in any department of life puts
up a good light with things and proves a
winner, or even a splendid failure has a story
well worth recording; but very seldom is the
record given in an attractive manner.
Generally too much is hidden or too much
revealed ; this book hits the happy mean and
gives us just enough. Of course, no one
would claim that such a work is going to
stand among the great biographies; its'place
is rather among the gossip books that last so
well and tell so much of the history and spirit
of an age.
The Beerbohms came from some remote
place in Central Europe, and were a Dutch
Lithuanian-German mixture. The name Tree
was taken for stage use. and appears to have
been fixed in ,the family by the knighthood
which came along in 1909. Maud Holt,
studying for a university degree, met young
1 r£e in 1881, and began to think about “leav-
ing the Cloister of learning’for the Hearth of
the green-room.” They became engaged; kind
friends who could not understand an actor’s
world came ■between them and the ring was
returned. Then Herbert sent a letter by han-
som ; and Maud’s reply was to get into the
cab and come to him. In September, 1882,
they Were married. Herbert used to hand hex
over the whole of his salary every week,
“twenty pounds, as a matter of fact” —which
seems rather incredible for a twenty-nin”-
year-old in those days who was stiil onlv
promising. A little later the young actor had
no engagement. “So daily we walked light-
heartedly down the Haverstock Hill of life
together, singing, laughing, and buying clean
collars and snowdrops on the way.” They got
into debt and got oiit of it again. A child
was born— about 1887 real suc-
cess arrived.
• But the most interesting thing in the whole
book is the attitude of these people towards
their work. Maud is in an ecstasy when she
wins a promise from Herbert that she may
play Ophelia to his Hamlet. Thpn comes the
trial-run in Manchester
Jt, was -a divine time—that time of getting ready
—-for, however long the rehearsals, one could never
tire sheer love of my task enabled me to glide
into Ophelia with no other guide than that love.
1 had never known such jov in acting. ...1 remember
it was a dream of happiness—of congratulation—
ol that sensation of walking-on-air, which comes of
toy and security after agonies of apprehension. ...
\Vith what a passionate delight he merged ‘his. inch-
vidnality (not so unlike Hamlet’s own) into that
of the sweet prince.
Here are a pair of mummers worth your
money. If Maud Tree unconsciously gives us.
more of herself than of her husband, we- can
accept it all very gratefully.
But Herbert Tree lives in the pages. He
is a splendid enthusiast, always braced* and
heartened by temporary failure"; he lives in a
whirl of doing things, yet dreams in doing
them. He is full of sharp and pleasant, wit,
as witness things of this sort :
“When is repertory not repertory? When it’s a
success.” ' •.
“Everything conies to him who doesn’t wait.”
“To sacrifice an epigram on the altar of tact is
the last martyrdom of man.”
“I am a man of few words hut many speeches.”
“In tlieir old age the humbugs are found out.
They have not the energy to keep up the game.”
“If your hat blows off, never run after it. Some-
body will always run after it for yon.”
“He never said a tactless thing, and never did
a kind one.”
Bernard Shaw’s tribute to Tree is
characteristic. This is the text
One must confess bluntly at the outset that Tree
was the despair of authors.. His attitude towards
a play was one of whole-hearted anxiety to solve
the problem of how to make it please and interest
the audicnep. Now this is the author's business,
not the actor’s.
Shaw is probably right; but how many
dramatic authors ow r e their reputation to
actofs w'ho hold Tree’s view'!
At the beginning of the story the actor
appears as a tall, red-haired boy: at the end
of it he is no longer red-haired, but he re-
mains a boy. In the rehearsal of Shaw’s
“Pygmalion” he could not get over the slip-
pers which were thrown in his face, though
they were part of the business. Mrs.
Patrick Campbell had simply to cease hitting
him or he wouldn’t play. He never “studied”
a part; when he had learned the words he
acted it. W. L. Courtney says of him :-c~
His acting was never monotonous, rarely the
same from night to night You will remind me
that I am describing the qualities of an amateur,
not of a professional. I do not shrink from the
conclusion. Tree had all' the best points of an
amateur, and some of his triumphs were gained fast
for that reason. He was a glorified amateur who
dared things which a professional never would have
dared, and won a shining victory. He mistrusted
all talk about technique. “I have not got tech-
nique,” lie once said: “it is a dull thing. It enslaves
the imagination.”
The whole impression of one reading the
book is that this man of imagination, humor
and courage blew' like a fresh breeze through
the English theatre and kept clean and bright
the tradition which even the most mercenary
of cheap and over-advertised “stars” can
never wholly dim.

him and of his art collected by Max Beer-
bohm. (Hutchinson, London.)

PINKETTES
FOR YOUR LIVER
Pinkettes, the new laxative,
give excellent results in cases of bil-
iousness and torpid liver. People
who are unnaturally drowsy and
sleepy, who lack ambition and
energy, are usually victims of their
liver.
Pinkettes have a specific action
on the liver and speedily banish the
feeling of lassitude and weariness.
They are effective without being
drastic and they have none of the
bad effects of strong purgatives.
Pinkettes also regulate the stomach
and liver, correct bad breath, clear
the complexion, and are an ex-
cellent remedy to use during colds
and fevers.

[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
Seance.
I want to sing a thousand songs
This busy, blue, delightsome day,
Heaven-lyrics that will ease Death’s wrongs
And rhymes to make the whole world gay.
I want to do a million things
Large-minded Love provokes in me,
And, delving all rememberings,
Give Man the dream to set him free.
But laughter calls from isle and bay,
The merry sun is puffed with joy,
And I must waste the day away
By treating Time as Pleasure’s toy.
/
I am too filled with Life’s delight
To work the will divine in me.
Some singer in some distant night
Will solve all secrets. Let it be.
And maybe when I’m dead I’ll lie
Contented in the arms of ease,
And watch the happy summer sky
Play chasings with the morning breeze.
Nor ever stir myself to sing
To some poor dreaming living soul
The secret of Death’s triumphing
And why his bells for ever toll.
Far greater souls than I am know
The mystery, the peace, the light,
And yet they do not come and go
' And tell us why there must be night.
Perhaps they feel as I do here
Too selfish to arise and run
With messages to stay Life’s tear,
Their world, like mine’s., so full of fun.

Ennui.
You other children love the sun and rain,
And dream of stars, and winds from clover- _
fields;
But I am old and cannot dream again,
For me no rainbow yields
Its gold, nor any fairy pipes his magic
strain.
Still, the young night of stars is very fair
And beautiful and silent like the dead.
Dead with my dreams; for oncewa soul was
there,
Faint shadows kissed and fled,
And the wind sang across bright fields of
living air.
But that is past. I may not pause with you
Who count your lives in starlight and moon-
beams ;
My Heaven will be when I can dream anew
Those strange forgetful dreams,
And drink beneath the stars the breath of
clover-dew.

Once in Hyde Park.
Crossing Hyde Park, to take the morning air
And look upon the iris and the doves
Telling the dripping fountain of their
loves,
The goldfish darting in their weedy lair,
There was a woman told me once that where
The people flock in eager lunch-time droves
The waratah and quandong spread their
groves,
And pale rock-lilies hung their hollow stair.
O Life, that makest man and tree as one,
' These only asked their own day’s rain to
feed,
Nothing to them these later years’ display!
Ah, what to man is fame, his brief course
run?
Its praise or blame, how feeds it me....
who need
The bread and wine of friendly hands to-day?

Immortal.
The scrub was pearly on a golden morn,
With shafts of shining silver through the
green.
Nebulous shadows, gem encrusted, hung
Pulsing and waving as the day was born,
And spider-webs with every thread asheen
Prom blossomed branches airy bridges flung.
Buttressed and arched, cedar and fig and
palm,
In aisles of beauty stretched and melted dim
Into the burnished haze. Deep in the trees
White-pinioned pigeons fed, safe from alarm.
The creek purled to the mosses at its brim
A theme to the quiet measure of the bees.
I stood and watched and glowed and loved
with all
The waking loveliness of God’s sweet earth.
Akin to it, well knowing in my soul
That all was me, that I should never call
On age or death, for one are death and birth:
And youth and age but make the perfect
whole.

BLACK BONNET.
Philistine Song.
My lady is writing;
God keep her from ill,
Lest wrong thoughts come biting
The end of her quill!
Bad rhymes and false metre
And commonplace things
Shall never unseat her
’Mid Pegasus’ wings.
But I pray—yes, with weeping
I wrestle in prayer—
That the little thoughts sleeping
This hour in her hair
Won’t suddenly climbing
To ecstasy wild
Destroy all the rhyming
She made when she smiled.

THE CURSE OF UNCERTAINTY.
“This agreement will hold good unless the bosses
of the 0.8. U. or some other body decide to alter
it, which they may do at any moment.” — The unwrit-
ten clause in all industrial agreements nowadays.
Tales of dire and sudden slump come from
England, where' the bottom is temporarily
falling out of things. That sort of trouble
seems to manifest itself between two and six
years after every successful war. After an
unsuccessful one it happens sooner. It isn’t
so much a matter in England of the gradual
fading of huge war-boom prices which accom-
panied huge war-boom wages, as one of
sudden stoppage in the export of manufac-
tured goods. There was a final rise which
was the last millstone on the hump of the
sagging camel, and with unexpected unanim-
ity "the foreigner ceased to buy. This was
doubtless in small part because some wrecked
and battered countries were getting the
wheels of industry to revolve again, but
in large part it was because a time had
arrived when it was easier to go without
than to pay. And with the sudden cessa-
tion of business local people began to go
without also. It is one step from the sub-
lime to the impecunious, and J. Bull took
it. Manufacturers, loaded up with stock for
which the demand was vanishing, began to
sell for less profit, for no profit or at a
loss, though the cost of production had been
so enormous that even goods sold at a loss
weren’t cheap goods in the pre-war sense.
Manufacturers did this because they feared
worse things, to come, and because they had
bills for raw material which must be paid
even if some capital and reserves were lost
in the process. Then came news of fac-
tories closing or working four or three or
even two days a week. This is, of course,
not expected to be permanent, for the world
is as big as ever, and it hasn’t got out of
the habit of wearing clothes. But the
twenty-shilling market is becoming a ten-
shilling market, and must be supplied with
ten-shilling goods made at ten-shilling wages
or else the foreign trade will go. elsewhere —
to Germany almost to a certainty, and to
Russia if that chaotic land of cheap con-
script labor can get on its feet again. With-
out export trade it is probable that some-
thing like one-third of the British factories
would close and the slump would be perma-
nent. In Australia—in the two Labor-ruled
States, at all events —the hackneyed politi-
cian at once arises with the hackneyed
remedy: “Borrow £9,000,000 (Queensland)
or £14,000,000 (N.S.W.) every year on the
security of our unlimited natural resources,
and keep people employed building a rail-
way out to every wild dog in the dog-in-
fested West, and let Posterity pay.” But
Britain hasn’t the simple remedy of borrow-
ing £7 per inhabitant per annum, for there
is no one with £350,000.000 a year to lend,
and in any case there are no wild dogs in
England to build railways to, and there is
no space for 30,000 miles of new line per
annum in the United Kingdom. And Aus-
tralia won’t have the simple remedy much
longer, for the keg out of which it has had
its long drunk is almost dry.
* * * *
Australia certainly shows signs of slump.
There is talk of 4000 unemployed in Vic-
toria, of 20,000 in N. S. Wales (wild and
woolly legislation accounts for the extra num-
ber), and an unspecified number in Queens-
land (the Theodore Government is sufficient
explanation for almost anything). Yet there
is no reason why Australia should have a
slump, however bad the rest of the world
may be —no reason, in fact, why it shouldn’t
have a boom even if the bottom falls out of
the balance of the globe. Its factories aren’t
closing through the loss of their foreign
export trade, for they never had any to lose.
In fact, while other countries are losing
their customers Australia has, in proportion
to its population, the biggest reliable, un-
touched, unexploited and accessible market
on earth waiting for it—its own market.
A country which is importing foreign goods,
mostly manufactured, at the present rate
of £160,000,000 a year, and trying to borrow
money to pay for them, has at least
£100,000,000 worth of employment per
annum waiting for it if it cared to be em-
ployed, and it could fix its own wages,
with the reservation that if they were fixed
very high the price of the goods produced
would also be high. This chance represents
six times the value of the gold boom in
the gold boom’s supremely glorious year,
and it would be permanent, .inexhaustible
and always improving, whereas the golden
glory began to die almost as soon as it was
born. There is nothing save mismanagement
and misgovernment to prevent this Paetolus
being tapped so that Australia would be
born again and realise that its career is just
beginning.
* * * *
Australia has suffered from many things,
the basis of which was an idea that because
it had once been fabulously rich in gold and
silver and in land revenues which cost it
nothing, therefore its people had a right to
live in a style fitting their high estate even
after the high estate had been dissipated
and spent. Like the decayed peer it held
that to be supplied with money by loans
on personal security after its assets were
spent was the right of its birth, and that
work, save in moderation and on specially
easy conditions, wasn’t to be expected from
members of a shabby-genteel family. And
on top of this has lately been added a sort
of uncertainty that threatens to paralyse
effort. This comes through the domination
of a new school of Labor leaders or tyrants,
largely alien or at least non-Australian,
saturated with the cant of European con-
tinental theorists, soft-handed men, who toil
only with the jaw and who live largely on
foreign fends, Bolshevik and anarchist plati-
tudes, and the production of hatred and un-
rest. Their mission, to which they are
appointed by themselves, is to save Australia,
which wasn’t really lost till they came, and
be paid in cash, authority and gratitude for
doing it. In this respect they resemble the
self-sacrificing push element which wants to
save the jeweller’s, stock at any risk when
the next parish is on fire. To a certain dis-
orderly order of mind —the loud-mouthed
revolutionary sort —power is of little value
unless it is untidy and capricious power.
To be a great king bound by the law, just
like his own small subject, or the head of
a great corporation who has to observe ihe
articles of association just as rigidly as his
own office-boy, has no appeal. The ambition
is to say to one man “Go” and he goeth,
to another “Do” and he doeth, and to bid
another be a slave and a fool whereupon
he is —all according to the whim of the
moment and the cat-and-mouse instinct.
When a man in, say, Sydney, can wire with-
out explanation to a bound herd of Dagoes
at Kalgoorlie bidding them stop the timber
supply of the country’s biggest goldfield and
throw 3000 Australian miners out of work—
when he can do that and be obeyed it is
power. It is power also when somebody
afar off can give orders with no reason
assigned that the big ships shall be boy-
cotted at Brisbane, or that the Victorian coal
supply shall be suspended ; or that the 48-
hour week shall become 44 or 40 or 30 hours,
or that the wheat crop shall not be taken
off except at sudden double wages. N.S.W.
Minister Dooley, attitudinising proudly that
he had started to dissipate the people’s
money in gifts to persons said to be women
and prospective mothers, and that being
Dooley he required no authority save his
own, evidenced the same feeling, and it
sticks out in the Land Bill and the Profiteer-
ing Bill with their large and general autho-
rity to do almost anything or condone almost
anything.
* * * *
In fact, the ideal aimed at seems to be
the Turkish country official who mostly
makes his own statutes as he goes along.
It wasn’t Ottoman law which made fertile
Mesopotamia a desert, for the law is beauti-
ful enough, but the capricious exactions,
the meddling irresponsibility and erratic
breaking-out-in-new-spots of Garden Pasha
or Walsh Bey or Considine Effendi who,
when they saw any. signs of wealth, invented
a new Act of Parliament on the spot, and
made life a gamble. Hard, orderly tyranny
like that of Imperial Germany often leads
to great national wealth. Petty, dishevelled,
capricious tyranny under which no one can
foresee what will happen next or when it
will happen, or which will be struck and
which will escape, leads to desolation. In-
dustries can adapt themselves to high wages
and rigid conditions, but not to living on
a volcano. In Australia the habit of mak-
ing contracts far ahead threatens to become
extinct simply because no one knows what
a day may bring forth, and that is bad for
Australian industry though it helps along
imports, the borrowing disease and the habit
of living on largely useless Government
loan works. The men who work the explo-
sive game—mostly ignorant but strenuous
outsiders—don’t seem to make as much out
of it as might be made by honest, intelli-
gent industry: but for that matter most of
the old-style Turkish governors made little
either. The local tyrant over a consider-
able district in Palestine had. as a rule,
very little furniture on his battered premises,
while the barred windows of the harem fre-
quently had their broken glass replaced with
odd substances. The fertile district had given
up hope and settled down in doorless, win-
dowless hovels because a long series of
petty despots had fallen on the capitalist
whenever there were any signs of capital,
so at last it was more restful and just as
profitable to be without capital. Yet for
little visible reason save the love of dignity
and irresponsibility official billets of the sort
were the ambition of minor civil servants
and other thieves, just as there is a fierce
struggle for seats on Labor Councils. The
Hindu habit of burying money in the ground
where it earns nothing is the incurable
result of the same sort of rule. Money
doesn’t look safe in banks where it
might promote industry if the Maharajah
or the One Big Union is always planning
to “take over” the institutions or the Vizier
is addicted to forced loans. Australia hasn’t
developed the money-burying habit yet, but
it has gone more than half-way on the road :
except in rare cases it refuses to put its
money into any business or industry which
involves the employment of much labor.
THE CASE FOR POSTERITY.
“I am a pacifist. I will experience pride and joy
on the day Australia declares itself an independent
republic.’’— Alderman Bramston (Sydney).
“It is officially reported from Tokio that armed
bands of Korean malcontents were broken up in
skirmishes near Shangteo. The Japanese captured
three machine-guns and 500 rifles. Reprisals were
carried out against a village where the inhabitants
guided Japanese into an ambush. Seventy houses
were burned and a number of villagers shot. In
another town 130 houses and several churches and
schools were destroyed and 90 persons executed.”—
Cable message.
The world is full of people who clamor for
things and hope to God they will never get
them. Alderman Bramston probably
belongs to >this class, since he does not bear
the reputation of being a fool. But many
really believe the balderdash that politicians
talk with their tongues in their cheeks.
Germany is in ruins because the people
listened for so long to the war-party’s blither
about “mailed fists” that they got to believe
it was practicable to seize half the world by
force of arms. In France neither the
Jacobins of the 18th nor the Communists
of the 19th century thought beforehand of
the Terror which is inseparable from revo-
lution on the grand scale; and neither did
the people who brought about the agony
through which Russia is now passing. It
is safe to talk and write hifalutin nonsense
in the early stages of most movements.
Freetrade, the policy which nearly lost
Britain the war in 1917, was a harmless if
not beneficial thing from the standpoint of
an adult Englishman of 1870. Rousseau
doubtless felt no qualms when he wrote his
“Social Contract.” Even if he foresaw the
ultimate effect of his theories on the French
people, which is unlikely, he must have
known that he would be gone before the up-
heaval arrived. It has always been so.
The children starve or are enslaved because
some members of the sheltered grandfather
generation had a passion for skite. In Aus-
tralia’s case posterity will certainly be pre-
sented with an immense debt and many
international complications; and if people of
the Bramston type have their way that is
about all that the luckless unborn will get.
The Commonwealth is to have no navy and
no citizen army, and the Power which
enabled us to safely do without either for
over a century must be cast off amidst re-
joicings.
n A • *
The only evident advantage of this last
proceeding will have been to give our Bram-
stons a transient sensation of pride and
happiness. Transient because national
humiliation is bound to begin at once, even
if utter disaster is warded off during the
lifetimes of those who effectuate the change.
It is easy to picture the birth of the new
republic. Politicians and aldermen will talk
windy humbug about the liberty which can
only be enjoyed under complete independ-
ence ; a number of new and well-paid offices
will be created, and the politicians and their
friends will fill them ; more money will be
needed, and it will be got on the usual lines.
With any luck domestic changes should not
be great so long as the country is left to
itself. The measure of its period of im-
munity may best be got by a glance at a
map of the South Pacific. Empire-building
is a game which is played according to cer-
tain more or less fixed rules. When a power-
ful country decides that its destiny lies in
a new part of the world it begins by estab-
lishing a sphere of influence. If the chosen
land is sufficiently defenceless the sphere
will actually be established within its boun-
daries, as happened at the end of last
century to Korea, and towards the' begin-
ning of this to China, at the hands of Japan.
But the customary method is to come as close
as possible and await events. Spheres of in-
fluence are created (11 by seizure or pur-
chase. (2) by peaceful penetration. It is
a reasonable proposition that if Japan’s
expansionists hadn’t decided on assimilating
Australia at some time, given favorable con-
ditions. their Empire’s feelers would not
now be a few hundred miles from the eastern
shores of the Commonwealth. For Japan’s
rightful place ,is the' Northern Pacific and
nowhere else. It is bad enough from the
Australian standpoint that the Japanese
should hold the Marshall and Caroline
Islands. But, anyhow, these danger-spots
are occupied under treaty with the central
Government of the strongest Empire in the
world, and Australia is still a part of that
Empire. The conditions which govern their
retention were imposed by Downing-street
with an eye to Australian opinion, even
though Australia wasn’t consulted on the
matter at the time. Far more serious and
significant than Japan’s present holdings in
our vicinity is the fact that the Japanese Gov-
ernment obviously intends to hold other places
in the future. Japanese are flocking to the New
Hebrides and New Caledonia, and they pro-
mise shortly to be the real owners, of the
Loyalty and Marquesas Islands. Britain
can do nothing as regards this development,
and Australia less than nothing: it is a
question which concerns only Japan and
France. It is absolutely certain that the
first foreign demand made upon an Austra-
lian republic would come from Japan, and
that it would take the form of an order to
the new Power to revise its old theories
about alien immigration. The ultimatum
might not arrive in time to mar the inaugu-
ral celebrations. It is even conceivable that
some who are advocating republicanism with
disarmament now might see the policies they
clamor for introduced and die comfortably in
their beds before the inevitable harvest
began to be reaped. But nothing would save
posterity. Japan is in the South Pacific
now with the object, amongst others, of
being able to deal effectively with the Aus-
tralian of a coming generation in certain
eventualities.

When imported cranks are bragging and
blarneying it is a salutary thing for Aus-
tralians to put themselves' in the position- of
one of those countries which did what they
are asking Australia to do. There would be
ho Irish question, for example, to-day if
Ireland had been organised for defence 700
years ago. The Japanese are only in Korea
now because in 1910, when they insisted that
the country should be annexed, its emperor
deposed and the very name changed, the in-
habitants were unable to object- If anyone
suggests that it is absurd to compare the
race that bred the Anzacs with Asiatics it
is enough to answer that valor is useless
against weight of metal. The entire Aus-
tralian navy, as at present constituted, would
be unable to make a fight of it with one of
Japan’s modern capital ships. Meanwhile
our pacifists are calling for the abandonment
of all sea-defence, as against the latest
Japanese naval proposals for the building of
16 post-Jutland battleships by 1922. The
anti-armament and cut-the-painter policies
are no doubt attractive for the moment, like
the hectic existence of the spendthrift who
ends in the Insolvency Court. The less the
country spends on naval and military defence
the more it will have for members’ salaries,
raised wages, mothers’ endowment schemes
and so forth; and the shaking off of the
British yoke will free Australia from the
necessity of ever again equipping an ex-
peditionary force. There should be glorious
times for those in control of the national
funds while the new regime lasts. But
would it be worth it at the price of the
execrations of the millions of Australians yet
unborn who will look to those now living
for that liberty and security which our fore-
bears made such sacrifices to pass on to us?
And if, as is no doubt the case, the great
betrayal isn’t really intended and is only
discussed with the object of winning the
cheap applause of the tho'uglitless, then
wouldn’t the subject be better left alone?
There is no limit to the insanities which
people are capable of being persuaded into
by the frequent repetition of one rotten
argument.
THE DECAY OF COUNTRY TOWNS.
In public every Minister yearns to give
places like New England, the Northern
Rivers and Iliverina (N.S.W.) a fair deal,
and help them to self-dependence and pros-
perity, and see their ports grow and flourish.
He does this with the fervor of a Turk
yearning to be good to an Armenian, or
Archbishop Mannix struggling to be a
brother to Orange Lodger Snowball, or
Lloyd George rushing to give Ireland its
independence. And if he hears that there
is a sign of real life, in any district, north
or south, which doesn’t belong geographically
to the big metropolis, and so is liable to slip
away some day, he is filled with gladness —
the gladness of a man who hears that all
his rich relations are dead and have left him
nothing. So it came to pass the other day
that a deputation from a rich, roadless, un-
railwayed section of the North waited on
Minister Estell, who, because he belongs
100 miles north of Sydney but 300 miles
south of Tweed Heads on the Queensland
border, is as near to being a northern mem-
ber as the North can expect, and told him
a story. It wanted, not an impossible line
passing its own shut-up ports and carrying
things south some impossible distance, but
an east-and-west line to bring the products
by a short cut to a new port at some place
of its own, like Goff’s Harbor. It wanted an
honest sort of railway, like the one that
strikes westward from Sydney to Con-
dobolin. In fact, it wanted to have the
whole policy of 70 years reversed and the
leopard to change his spots and the nigger
to turn pale all over. And the Minister,
an ancient and wily person who knows how
many hasbeens make five, was sympathetic,
like all previous Ministers since there have
been Ministers. He promised to bring the
matter before his colleagues, as has hap-
pened ever since colleagues were invented.

A new book issued by the N. S. Wales
State Statistician at a very appropriate
moment shows what further progress had
been made up to 1918 in depressing and
retarding the country towns, so that the big
city and its adjacent satellite towns may
continue to bloat, with no real profit to
themselves. It is a record of things done,
not in ignorance, but in premeditated wicked-
ness and in selfishness and hypocrisy by
politicians who shed greasy tears as they
explain their, craving to “decentralise.”
There were in 1918 186 municipalities, of
which 44, including Auburn, Bankstown


and Lidcombe, were metropolitan; 12 were
in the Newcastle coal-mining group, and 130
were country. There were 130 country
municipalities a while ago, but deaths have
happened. As regards population, there
are only estimates to go upon since the
census which is now 91 years old, and the
census showed 50 towns outside the metro-
politan area, and 53 counties, also outside
that area, to be dying from loss of popula-
tion. The estimates show that since census
day the metropolis has grown faster, ab-
sorbed a bigger proportion of the population,
depopulated the country more, and become
itself more squalid and congested than ever.
In the 91 years nearly as much loan money
was spent in “opening up the country’ as
during the previous half-century. Almost
to the last penny that money, even when
it was spent on railways as far out as
Trida, on the road to Broken Hill, Griffith,
Cargellico and Mungindi, was spent to shift
trade and finance and industry, and conse-
quently population, to the city. For open-
ing up new ports and-making new cities there
was not one copper. But though recent
population figures are only estimates, the
annual tax valuations (unimproved value)
are statistics, and out of the 130 country
municipalities 67 were worth less in the
aggregate than at some previous date often
worth fewer pounds of cheap, depreciated
paper than they were once valued at in
solid sovereigns. Northern towns that are
losing even paper-money valuq_jnclude Bal-
lina, Casino, Coraki, Gunnedah, Hillgrove,
Inverell, Maclean, Moree. Morpeth, Murrur-
undi, East and West Maitland, Narrabri,
Port Macquarie, Quirindi, Scone, Singleton
and Wingham. Northern towns that are
practically stationary include Armidale, Bar-
raba, Glen Innes, Grafton, South Grafton,
Ivempsey, Manila, Tamworth, Taree and
Ulmarra. Among southern towns that are
being written down are Albury, Bega, Braid-
wood, Cooma, Corowa, Grenfell, Gundagai,
Queanbeyan, Temora, Tumut, Ulladulla,
Wagga and many more. The Ma State is
divided also into 136 shires, and 51 of them
are losing value. These include practically
all in the districts that badly want separa-
tion and Home Rule, from Dalgety on the
edge of Victoria to Tenterfield on the rim
of Queensland. In the years 1915-18 the
value of Sydney and its suburbs (including
the possibly doubtful Auburn, Bankstown
and Lidcombe, which are on the suburban
and country border-line) increased by
£9,868,915. The value of the 130 country
municipalities increased by less than one-
tenth of this amount —£980,500. And that
little improvement was in places like 1 arra-
matta, Cabramatta, Prospect and Sherwood,
Camden, Campbelltown, Bowral, Liverpool
(where the old men’s homes are), Smith-
field and Fairfield, which hang round the
metropolis. # #
To destroy with the premeditation of the
Hun or the vandal even £lOO,OOO worth of
our own people’s assets and blight £lOO,OOO
worth of their hopes is an expensive matter.
It may cost a million of high-priced loan
money, invested in non-paying assets that
will be a drag on posterity. A railway is built
along the shore, down in the bottom ot a
one-sided furrow, so that it may develop the
sea on one side arid the roadless hillsides on
the other and carry great freight of seaweed
from place to place. A parallel line is built
on top of the hills. This parallel road is
either going somewhere, like the one that con-
nects by break of gauge with Brisbane, or just
travelling to take the air, like the that
stops at Nimmitabel. There is no connection
between the last two, lest inland produce
should make a break for the coast before it
reaches Sydney and try to climb on board
ship. South from N. S. Wales s One Big
City the Nowra line runs for its whole
length alongside the Goulburn-Nimmitabel
line, yet they don’t speak. To the north the
Coast line and the Sydney-Brisbane line run
alongside, and aren’t aware of each othei s
existence. Their capacity for avoiding good
ports where cities as big as Adelaide or Bris-
bane would be liable to arise very quickly is
marvellous. The N. S. W ales Coast hue
stops just short of Jervis Bay. The parallel
line, running lonesome like Kipling’s cat
upon the'top of the hills, passes Jervis Bay
and stops just short of Eden. The North
Coast line makes a circuit to avoid 1 ort
Stephens, and at the far end a break is care-
fully preserved to cut off Brisbane. There
are tremendous annual losses on these lines
because for the most part they were built to
keep up the semblance of activity, to muffle
the unemployed problem, to help along the
metropolis and to delude for a while dis-
affected districts which talk secession. They
are often ill-ballasted concerns, with anti-
quated rolling-stock that other places have
finished with, scarce trains and 10- or 15-mile-
per-hour schedules. Wheu they touch a har-
bor it is a wholly unequipped harbor —simply
a bit of the ocean which happens to be nearer
shore than most of the ocean. When the
settler, who has been eating out his heart
with hope deferred, realises what a gold
brick has been sold to him he abandons the
scene of 10 years’ wasted toil and goes shop-
keeping or tram-driving in the city.
* * * * •
Dorrigo, which recently sent a deputation
to Minister Estell, is a typical case. The
district is famous for fertility, a good water
supply, big timber, lack of roads, and long
disappointment. Nature meant that there
should be a fair-sized city at Goff’s Harbor,
which can accommodate big vessels at all tides,
and a railway west to Armidale, which ought
to be a real city, and to Barraba,'Narrabri,
Walgett and Bourke. Then Bourke, which
is really a northern town though the lay-out
of the railways makes it nominally western,
would have a shorter road to the sea and
might not be the corpse it is. And Dorrigo
would be 60 miles from an inland city
(Armidale) and about 30 miles from a
coastal city. By a premeditated wickedness
which never really did much good to Sydney,
though it was meant to do so, the distance
to Armidale is more than 300 miles by any
route practicable for heavy goods, and there
is no coastal city. It is often cheaper to
burn splendid timber than to sell it. The
New State people seek a remedy, partly by
appeals to Minister Estell, who stands for
the old gang, the old policy and the old
traditions and is too old himself to acquire
new ideas, and partly by repudiating John
and all his crowd. Its more obvious course,
unless the Constitution is promptly amended
to provide redress, will be to adopt the Sinn
Fein policy, though without the criminal
aspect, which would be , quite unnecessary, as
John’s Government has no army. In other
words, to secede off-hand as the Hebrew
Northern Rivers did from Rehoboam,
establish its own Parliament, police, law
courts and income- and land-tax depart-
ments, and ask the Federal Government,
and, if necessary, the British Government,
for recognition—that is, for Home Rule
within the Commonwealth and the Empire.
HOW ROBESPIERRE CAME TO
WOOLLOOMOOLOO.
This is neither the birth anniversary nor the
death anniversary of Maximilien Marie
Isidore de Robespierre —he really owned
the aristocratic “de,” if that was any good
to him, and was a barrister and a gentle-
man without Act of Parliament —but it is
necessary to drag him in by reason of the
back yards of Woolloomooloo. The connec-
tion is intimate if not obvious. As a sort
of preparation for Christmas the S. M.
Herald published a description of that
region of hideous overcrowding and mean
streets —a blot of premeditated and pur-
poseful and sinful and unclean and sunless
congestion in a vast empty land of sun-
shine ; about the most packed spot in the
biggest and most packed city in Australia,
it wept not only crocodile tears but whole
crocodiles over the matter. Tlie fashion of
crocodiling over Woolloomooloo had been re-
vived a few weeks previously by a vicar of the
district, who had described it as a place where
it is held “that every girl has the right to
be a mother.” This was because modesty
and decency are crushed out of the souls of
people, where hulking youths and big girls
share the same rooms and even the same
beds for sheer want of space (the space
that money can’t buy), and where 12ft.
by lift, back yards make any kind of seclu-
sion impossible. All the preaching and teach-
ing between the first day of Galilee and now
can’t save these people of the meanest streets
from the orthodox perdition—if there is
such a place. Yet neither papers nor par-
sons ever demand the one obvious remedy—
to let new cities or even new State capitals
grow up at places like Jervis Bay, Twofold
Bay, Port Stephens and Coif’s Harbor, where
they want to grow and are only prevented
by vast expenses in railway deviation and
much trouble-* in railway omission. They
would draw off a lot of population, and
the only remedy for too many people is to
have fewer people. But, then, it is unfashion-
able to disturb the bloated pride of any
congested Australian city. Better that
people are miserable here and damned later
on.
Robespierre found France with some
27,000,000 people on an area only two-
thirds that of N. S. Wales—about 135 people
per square mile, while N. S. Wales has less
than seven. It was a time of primitive
medicine and primitive sanitation, conse-
quently a few people made an insanitary
crowd. Horrible forms of death, including
the smallpox variety., now practically extinct,
lived in the crowded places. People couldn’t
live far out, for there were neither trams,
railways nor motors. It was difficult to
live far up, for lifts weren’t invented.
Famines took place for lack of means to shift
food from place to place. Robespierre had
no abundance of empty places, as Australian
politicians have, on which to build new
cities. He decided that if there wasn’t
room for surplus population elsewhere there
was in Heaven. People would die anyhow,
and why shouldn’t they die a little sooner
for the good of others? He was the first
man to be moved (except to tears) by the
sight of Woolloomooloo. He reckoned that
with 8,000,000 population, well spaced-out,
all well-fed and clothed and housed and edu-
cated. and all healthy. France would be
better than with 27,000,000, many of them
doomed to slum it to the grave. He couldn’t
tell his secret to the people or to more than
a fraction of his colleagues. The community
didn’t mind much while it thought only its
aristocratic enemies were being killed. It
growled when barbers and seamstresses began
to be included in the death lists, for they
didn’t look like aristocrats ; still it admitted
they might be. If it had known that it was
proposed to w r eed out 60 per cent, of its
whole numbers, including most of the execu-
tioners when they had finished executing and
were neither useful nor ornament&l, the lid
would have blown off the volcano in a
minute.
The Lonesome Cleaner made no very
courageous end. But the courage of his life
exceeded that of all the bulldogs in all the
dog shows on earth. He was very lonesome.
A few of his colleagues were told what the
Terror was about, but it is questionable if
any of them except St. Just remembered.
The theory of the rest was that even a
purposeless Terror was better than no Terror
at all. Some of them found it a source of
big income, for they sold protection and
immunity just as these things will be sold
when some of the laws at present under con-
sideration or lately passed in Australia are
in working order. It doesn’t appear that he
was naturally cruel. He didn’t attend
executions and gloat. He was neat and
spotlessly clean; also he was spotlessly
bilious. He neither swore to excess nor wal-
lowed in luxury. He was no pursuer of the
nude. It isn’t" alleged that any woman was
the worse in her conventional morals for
knowing him. He was called “the Incor-
ruptible” because he was, and also to dis-
tinguish him from all the other men who
weren’t. And he was pious after a fashion
and believed in God. He allowed the most
objectionable Hebert to abolish religion with
all manner of obscenities, as has been done
lately in Russia, because he wasn’t strong
enough at the moment to wipe out Hebert ;
but he marked him for destruction all the
same. Seven weeks before his own death
Robespierre restored God. It isn’t every-
body who restores God. He even put on a
new sky-blue coat for the occasion. He hated
most of the instruments he had to use and got
rid of all he could, partly to make room,
according to his doctrine, and partly because
they didn’t look pretty. Carrier was a huge,
cowardly ruffian, with an itching palm.
Marat was an unclean dwarf, who itched all
over, and was insatiable for luxury, though
he posed as a bread-and-water hermit. Dan-
ton was lazy, loud, incoherent, an unabashed
robber, .a great eater and drinker, a pursuer
of strange females (at least he had them
brought to him), and he had a blunt nose and
a head like a globe. Anaciiarsis Clootz
was Prussian, wooden, wild and mad. Hebert
hurt his leader's feelings by dancing on
altars. Camille Desmoulins lacked rest-
fulness. Egalite, whose vote was the
majority of one which sent his cousin the king
to death, was despicable and blotchy. This
last made him repulsive to a man who was
cleanly and honestly bilious without pimples.
There is no more solitary figure in history
than the Incorruptible going about alone amid
crowds with all the back yards of France
upon his mind, and not one really congenial
soul, except perhaps St. Just, to swap blood-
stains with.
Having looked on Woolloomooloo with a
seeing eye he set to work to repair its
horrors Ixy the only means in sight, and he
gave his life In the cause and left his repu-
tation for the dogs to tear at. He acted,
while Australian papers and parsons, with
an easy and obvious remedy before them,
neither act nor even point the way that
others may act. So, writing without cant
or anvthing special in orthodoxy, I fancy
it may be easier for Maximilien Robes-
pierre on Judgment Day than for many
vicars and some editors. The cleaning up
of a back yard was given him to do, and
he did it with all his might.
SOLOMON MALAPROP.
PLAIN ENGLISH.
Holiday Finances and Fantasies.
Some new statistics, bringing history up
to the end of October, show that in the pre-
ceding five dazzling months N. S. Wales im-
ported £10,712,441 worth more than it
exported. Adding interest on foreign debt,
the State had, in fact, to find about
£14,000,000 in gold, to settle the differences
for less than half a year. Meanwhile
Attorney-General McTiernan was sloshing
around with his bill for confiscating as
excessive some or any part of the profits
made as much as five years before the bill
existed. Even if he could have stolen the
whole A.M.P. Society and the whole of the
B.N.S.W. and Commercial of Sydney, it
wouldn’t have helped. He would have got
paper galore, but the only things that could
meet the case were hard coin or the products
of Australian hard work which could be
sold for coin. But the Government dared
not even mention work lest it should lose its
job; so it borrowed £6,500,000 of gold in
London at very high interest (the money
never left London, of course), and that was
a feather pushed against the rising tide.
Then the Australian banks in London an-
nounced that it wasn’t the least use for
people here —even people with millions of
paper—to send drafts in payment for
imported goods unless they sent bags of gold
with the drafts. The supply of coin to pay
with had run low. So the Federal Govern-
ment was urged to put its credit behind a
costly £10,000,600 loan in London —not a
Public Works Loan, but a Feathers and
Fluff Loan. Incidentally, as all these
imports shut off the demand for local pro-
ducts, 20,000 people are said to be out of
work in the Ma State alone; wherefore
several Ministers curse the “capitalist” and
at the same time push ahead the policy
of still less production. A new bill forbids
more than 44 hours’ work per week. The
Timber Workers’ Union has decided to go
slower and do less work for the same wages
—to give short weight, in fact. A new
shearing proposition ijj for £l2 per week with
board, lodging and railway fares, payment
by results to be abolished and as little as
possible done. The doing of less work
always sticks out at least as conspicuously
as the getting of more money; in fact,
diminished production is often the more
prominent. In the midst of it all Australia
settles down to a giddy holiday, partly fooled
by its own inclinations and partly doped
by the poison of men who make money out
of these disastrous conditions. For there
never were conditions out of which some
men could not imake a profit. Even in a
pestilence there are dividends for the under-
taker.
The Hun and the Outlook.
The Hun is coming back. The news is all
over the world. Unlike the Frenchman,
Belgian, Italian and Serb, the war left
his factories practically intact, and Berlin
wasn’t even bombed as London was. He
hasn’t to waste years in rebuilding and he
hasn’t begun to pay the alleged victors tor
their rebuilding expenses, thanks largely to tne
time consumed on Wilson's footling League
of Nations. He has no unprofitable colonies
to maintain; no Ireland to keep down; no
fleet and not much army to support; and not.
one expensive philanthropic mandate upder
which he is expected to mother some bare-
footed tribe and keep it in boots. Even the
depreciation of his currency helps him to
undersell almost everybody. First of all he
methodically readjusted his factories, which
had mostly been munition-making. Then
he methodically refilled his empty warehouses.
Then he methodically slopped over into the
world’s markets —slopped like an avalanche.
The Austrian Hun, built of softer material,
wallows in despair, but there is more and
more talk of him being "taken over’ - by his
boiler-metal northern orother. In other
words, schemes are already afoot for start-
ing a new Big Hun State, only with safer
materials than the cranky Boles and the
infuriated Alsatians and Lorrainers who
hampered the old one. As for the League:
(1) Of the three States with big armaments, by
land or sea, Russia and the United States were
never in. Japan is 10 per cent, in, and, by reason
of its demand for racial equality, 90 per cent. out.
It is 100 per cent, indifferent.
(2) Argentina, the second most powerful Ameri-
can State, has resigned because its friend Germany
wasn’t admitted. It may be the nucleus of a nasty
rival League.
(3) Britain has Ireland on its hands and finds
it a handful.
(4) Italy can’t or won’t put down Poet D’Annun-
zio’s chronic insurrection, and if the buffer of this
rebel was removed war with Serbia might follow.
Italy, by its recognition of Russia, took a line of
its own.
(5) The new States are mostly too weak to count
for much yet.
(6) The League has no army, navy, police force
or taxing power.
Meantime the U.S.A. grows more and more
suspicious of Japan, and more and more
angry with Britain for contemplating a re-
newal of the alliance in that quarter. And
Australia —well, Australia is encouraged to
“look to the future with optimism and con-
fidence.” It recalls the first days of the war
when, asked for a motto suitable, for the
occasion, D. R. Hall, then N. S. Wales
Attorney-General, said, “Spend, spend
spend !” and was applauded heartily for his
“far-seeing statesmanship.”
Plain and Unabashed.
Before the Senate shut up shop for the
summer an unsavory squabble occurred be-
tween President Givens and Hugh de
Largie, who has never contrived to learn
that the House is above the level of a health
board or shire council, although he has been
a Senator for 20 years. Merely as a wrangle
the thing is beneath notice, but incidentally
it let in light on a subject of importance
to the taxpayers —the responsibility of log-
rolling politicians for the bloating of the
public services. De Largie had been bad-
gering the Queenslander and boring the other
Senators over the grievance of a lift-boy
whom utvens had reprimanded. Finally
the gas-cylinder from Groperland exploded
in a preposterous attack on the President,
and that exasperated functionary hit back as
follows: —
The genesis of this trivial matter dates back to
six or seven years ago. Ever since then it has not
been possible—and it never will be possible—for me
to do anything right in the estimation of Senator
de Largie. At that time there was a vacancy on the
Hansard staff, and Senator de Largie approached me
with a request for consideration for a gentleman
who had just married one of Senator de Largie’s
daughters. The Senator spoke to me more than once
about the matter. I informed the head of the Par-
liamentary Reporting Staff, Mr. Friend, that the
applicant in question was a connexion of Senator
de Largie’s, and I bespoke for him not merely fair
consideration, but I went so far as to urge Mr.
Friend to strain a point in favor of his selection if
he could possibly do so without injury to the service.
When the qualifications of the candidates were put
before me by Mr. Friend I asked him particularly
if he could not give a little more favorable considera-
tion to the gentleman who had been recommended by
Senator de Largie. He replied that he could not
possibly recommend him in competition with the
other applicants. The Senator complained bitterly,
was very angry, and told me emphatically that his
son-in-law did not get a fair deal.
It is an instructive and a suggestive state-
ment. De Largie uses his influence as a
Senator to get his son-in-law a billet on
Hansard. Givens intercedes with the head
of Hansard in the interest of De Largie’s
son-in-law. He bespeaks for De Largie’s
son-in-law “not merely fair consideration”
but “favorable consideration.” He urges
the Hansard man, if the latter can “pos-
sibly do so without injury to the service”
(the injury to his conscience couldn’t have
mattered), to “strain a point” in favor of
De Largie’s relative. And in the recapitu-
lation of the sordid story there was nothing
to show that either Givens or De Largie
regarded his conduct as reprehensible. No
expression of regret or repudiation of essen-
tial facts came from the Westralian. The
Queenslander is apparently convinced that
his own conduct >vas characterised by a
rare degree of moral elevation. This attitude
suggests that the manoeuvre in which both
men were engaged is so common a feature
of Australian public life that the generality
of politicians see nothing derogatory in the
business. It didn’t succeed in this instance
because Hansard is one of the few branches
of the public service in which personal capa-
city is even more important than a politi-
cian’s recommendation, but there are innum-
erable instances in which it did succeed.
For every place-hunter who failed to get
what he was after by working the political
oracle there are thousands who haven’t
failed. The practice, or swindle, is a prime
cause of the plethora of public servants from
which the Commonwealth and most of the
States are suffering; moreover, it has low-
ered’the standard of efficiency in the bloated
departments and adversely affected the rate
of pay. For if a civil servant is liable at
any time to have a politician’s protegS

Peace? Shall we prate of death while life
is here?
To be at peace were to be dull as waves
That murmur not, but lie in sunken caves
A thousand fathoms from the morning s

These may not know the roar of waters

That leap to ruin in the whirlpool grave;
But better the black tempest, loud and
brave,
Than shelter in the refuge-vault of Fear.
War is our blood, our life, our salt of bread ;
But how should this be war, this red, foul
thing . .
That blinds a child with weeping m the
night?
Sword, shard and flame with flesh of
nations fed,
The tiger talons ready for the spring
These do but hold men from the living fight.
11.
Man is a spirit. Shall he rend and gnaw
Of bestial rage, grown ape-like in a day,
Or dart a serpent-venom at his prey.
Leaving the dream he dreamt, the good he
saw?
Shall his ripe brain be but a sharper claw,
All his philosophies but show the way
With keener zest and broader will to slay
His own thought-brother in the fields of law?
No. Wars of men are of another make;
There is a braver thunder for the drum.
Rank upon rank, the strong recruits of
Truth
Dare in the breach of darkness, storm and
break
The sruarded deeps of Ignorance, long dumb,
And lift the world to see God’s splendid
youth !

The Dampness of “Dry” America.
“Bob” Dexter, whom The Bulletin found
an altogether trustworthy contributor in
Australia, writes from New York: —
Three miles out of ’Frisco the bang as the bar
door closes sounds like the last crack of thunder before
a five-years’ drought. Actually the youth wander-
ing down the gangway to the Land of the Free is
coming out of the bottle into the vat, for Prohibi-
tion has merely provided saloon-keepers with a
glorious opportunity to raise their prices 700 per
cent.
I celebrated my birthday one night last month by
taking my wife down to a big Broadway place for
dinner. Half-way through I bemoaned the drought;
and out of the silence the waiter’s voice boomed:
“What’ll you have?” He brought cocktails in cups,
hock in a colored water-bottle, and liqueurs in
opaque goblets specially cast for the purpose. Also
he brought a bill that looked like a National debt.
I was initiated.
At an Italian restaurant near Greenwich Village
a waiter asks customers if they are friends of John
Maltby. I never met the gentleman, but I soon
found that John is the password to unlimited liquor.
In a French restaurant in the forties “point-blank”
glistens nakedly on every table, while in English,
American, Spanish, Chinese, Hungarian and Dago
eating-houses all the way from lst-street to 200th-
street liquor flows knee-deep for the initiated. And
initiation is easy.
But getting a drink by paying for dinner is a
costly way. The direct method is, to walk into
almost any near-beer saloon on almost any corner
In New York, plank down 75 cents, demand a
whisky, and drink it in full view of the mob. You
can have as many more as you can pay for, and
drink yourself blind as long as your money lasts,
for the sale of hootch is gloriously untrammelled by
a.in.’s and p.m.’s. There are between 3000 and
4000 saloons in New York, all heroically carrying
on, undeterred by the fate that occasionally wrecks
one of their number which doesn’t pass the baksheesh
in the right direction.
Prohibition is a Federal law, to be enforced by
Federal agents, who are regarded by the police with
that same contempt which Sydney police bestow on
the city council’s khaki-clad patrolmen. Hence police
interference is not a dangerous possibility.
The traffic is quite open. A salesman presented
a printer’s business card at my office last week and
then quoted me at the following rates for his real
lines:—
Gordon’s Dry Gin, $6.50 per bottle; $7O per case
of a dozen. Rye Whisky, $7 per bottle ; $BO per case
of a dozen. Clan McKenzie Scotch, $lO per bottle ;
$lOO per case of a dozen. Italian Vermouth, $6
per bottle; $6O per case of a dozen.
He booked my order and the stuff was delivered next
day. He went through the building doing the same
thing. Two days ago another whisky salesman made
a call, posing as an engraver. He quoted similar
rates t.o those above. They are just about standard;
but to buy the stuff in bottles over a saloon-counter
costs twice as much.
Certainly few drunken men are seen on New
York streets, but that is an evil rather than a good
result of Prohibition. It has kept the drunks at home
to get drunk. The amount of “home-brew” which
New York gargles is terrible. The owner of an
apartment-house swore the other day that in 27
out of 42 flats in his place there were private stills,
brewing mule-kick concoctions too bad to be sold
even in a pub. Retailers of dried figs, dried raisins,
dried apples and other fruits that create an alcoholic
ferment are doing over 100 per cent, more business
than ever before, while ironmongers selling oil-
stoves, metal pipes, burners and copper containers
can’t keep up with the demand. I have by me a
paper carrying announcements by ten different firms
advertising stills for sale at $25 each.
The 18th Constitutional Amendment merely pro-
hibits the sale of intoxicating liquors in U.S.A. To.
make it operative the Volstead Act has been passed,
prescribing the maximum of alcohol in any drink to
be one-half of one per cent. The Act gives power
to the agents to prohibit the sale and manufacture
of liquor, but it does not allow a search for stills
in private houses unless ordered by warrant; and
the issuing of warrants against a million or more
householders in New York is a big job.
The question of Prohibition has been side-stepped
by both Democrats and Republicans in this Presi-
dential campaign, but the wishes of the people are
well known. The return of Senator Warren Harding
was assured by the results of a “straw”-ballot con-
ducted by 5000 motion-picture theatres in America.
The Republican preponderance was two to one. The
ballot also submitted referenda on two other ques-
tions : the acceptance or rejection of the League of
Nations, and the legalisation of the sale of beer
and light wines. The rejection of the League of
Nations was so unanimous that Harding, who had
been doing some double-shuffling on the issue, came
out in absolute opposition to the Covenant. The
majority in favor of beer and light wines was
three to one, and after his return Harding is not
likely to neglect that. All that is necessary is the
passage by Congress of an amendment to the Vol-
stead Act, increasing the alcoholic maximum to 6
per cent. That will entirely overcome Prohibition in
all States that were not dry before the Volstead
Act made them so. By the same simple procedure
the alcoholic percentage could be raised to 100 if
Congress wanted it, and it is a safe bet that within
a few years the Volstead Act will be covered with
amendments. But being a prophecy, that cannot be
covered by my affidavit, which goes with every other
statement I have made.
Some Comfortable Delusions.
Not only is Uncle Sam’s tariff a dreadfully
difficult thing to climb over, and his capacity
for selling 60s. worth of Huckleberry sewing-
machine at £lB 10s. a thing to admire at a
safe distance ; he has also a special law pro-
viding that trust operations, which are a
crime if done against his own people, are
lawful and commendable if done against us.
On top of all he has a spasmodic way of
shutting out commodities entirely. At the
present time he is running a powerful agita-
tion for the exclusion of foreign wool for an
indefinite period, because the country is.said
to have large supplies on hand; and it is
widely demanded that the influx of wheat
.shall be prohibited for similar reasons. Yet
Australia, even if Uncle Sam rejects its wool,
will probably continue to let him unload on
it frock-coats and pants made of his own
or Argentine clips, for this is a meek con-
tinent, and when smitten on one . ear it
immediately lends the other to a glozing tale
about a gold brick to be sold at a great
reduction. But apart from this threatened
action of the U.S.A., we have a. wool
trouble largely based on the competition of
THE TEST MATCH.
Argentina. That Federation is only a shade
over one-third the.size of Australia, but by
energy, high ambition and attention to busi-
ness it does things. It is a little ahead of
us in sheep, 150 per 6ent. ahead in cattle,
nearly 300 per cent, ahead of us in horses,
and can lay us three hogs to one. It ex-
ports nearly twice as much wheat as Aus-
tralia did at its best, and much flax —we sell
none —and it keeps pace with Australia in
sugar, beats it badly in manufactures, and
has two fairly progressive States in its
tropical section, while Australia has none.
Above all, Argentina has less than a third
of Australia’s debt. As for the wheat pros-
pect, Canada and the U.S. have record crops
and India is a healthy competitor. Still,
wheat was never Australia’s strongest point.
What hurts is the idea of being told even by
one hitherto considerable customer that our
wool is superfluous. N. S. Wales Motherhood
Minister McGirk, sitting amid the ruins of
great schemes, declared a few days ago that
all was well because a hundred millions would
pour into Australia during the next six
months “for wheat, wool and other produce.”
Unfortunately, the British market is loaded
with wool, which was paid for long ago and
the money spent, the markets for the other
raw products are uncertain, and, on the other
hand, there are vast, pressing .liabilities in
London, and our orgy of foreign buying has
not been ended. Australia could make a for-
tune by supplying manufactured goods for its
own market instead of buying from foreign-
ers, including the resurrected Hun —it
could, that is. if it got out of the servile
habit of allowing the Bolsheviks of the
0.8. U. and other non-productive enemies
to smite every industry on sight. But it
looks as if for the next year or two reliance
on our boundless natural resources will be
verv like backing a one-legged horse for a
race. It is difficult to rouse courage and
energy and self-reliance in Australia, for
the community is filled with the sloth and
pride which come of living and loafing on
loans for a generation. Still, the next few
years may be strenuous enough to cause a
sort of awakening.
♦
Britain’s Dilemma.
A recent cable mentioned that Mr. Lloyd
George made a striking appeal for more
food production. Even when harvests were
good, Great Britain, he said, produced only a
quarter of the wheat required. Further: —
This is a temptation to foreign enemies to attack
us, by adopting means by which we may be starved.
Moreover, there is the question of national health.
Whereas 50 years ago one-third of the people were
employed on' the land, only one-ninth were so em-
ployed in 1914.
This is the voice of Mr. Lloyd George,
Protecjtionist. As a Freetrader, shortly
before the war, he used to contend
that it was uneconomic to gfow food at home
when it could be more cheaply imported.
When he was a Radical he had an explana-
tion quite unconnected with tariffism of the
decline and fall of English agriculture from
1870 onwards. He blamed the short-sighted
selfishness of the landlords. And therein
Lloyd George was right. When Joseph
Arch began his struggle for the British
agricultural laborer half a century ago the
average wage was about 95., rising as high
as 12s. in the Midlands and falling as low as
ss. in the South. Arch formed a farm-
workers’ union which asked for a rise of 2s.
6d. a week. The response of the farmers
was to boycott the unionists, a decision in
which they were stimulated by the landlords’
policy of getting rid of any tenant who paid
the rat 6 demanded. F. E. Green in his
famous “History of the English Agricultural
Laborer” remarks: “There is no doubt....
the lock-out of 1874 delivered a blow against
English agriculture from which it has never
really recovered. The land was denuded by
migration and emigration of thousands of
the most virile workers.” When the Asquith
Government fell and Lloyd George became
associated with the Tory peers and squires
who now dominate his actions, he assimi-
lated their views on the agricultural question.
The Corn Production Bill, which was intro-
duced in the desperate days of 1917, fixed
a generous price for corn for five years;
that is to say, it protectively insured the
landlords for that period. At the same time
the Agricultural Wages Board was directed
to fix the rate of payment for farm-laborers
so as to “ensure for able-bodied men the
equivalent for an ordinary day’s work of
255. a week.” But 255. in 1917 was only
equal to 14s. 6d. in 1913. So a fresh exodus
began; and two results followed. The pro-
blem of running a big estate with an
insufficient supply of skilled labor got too
big for many of the holders, and they began
to sell out. to those who were rich enough
to let the land lie idle or to farm as a
hobby. The natural outcome is that the
British food position, from the home-produc-
tion standpoint, has grown steadily worse,
and is still doing so. What better lesson
does Australia need in the unpatriotic folly
of governing with an eye to a particular
class? The class concerned can never see
the position as a whole. Its members are
only able to appreciate, for the time being,
as employers, that increased wages are
objectionable; as employees, that a decreased
scale is intolerable. But under the modern
Party system one of these two sections is
usually in a position to enforce its aims,
and at the same time bring danger if not
destruction to the whole community.
“The correspondent of a London paper sends from
Berlin a piquant picture of the former Kaiser, gath-
ered from his chaplain. Dr. Drvander, who has just
arrived from Doom. The chaplain depicts the Im-
perial runaway as in a religious frame of mind,
meekly recognising God’s hand in his present suffer-
ing.”— Cable.
When the news was published in the clos-
ing stages of the war that the Kaiser “spent
many hours praying for victory,” a London
paper headed the item: “Wilhelm 11. be-
comes a religious maniac.” Now that he
acts as the Bible enjoins in the case of
those who are down and out, he is considered
a fair mark for derision. The point of view
clearly is that a man must be a hypocrite
who foments war for gain and yet claims
to be a Christian. Extending the principle
further, one who stirs up industrial strife
for his salary as a union boss or editor, or
who creates sectarian hatred for political
purposes or for that notoriety which has
such a healthful influence on the collection-
plate—any one of these should also provoke
contemptuous laughter when she professes
Christian sentiments. That being so, there
is no need to go to Doom in quest of texts
for sermons on snuffle. There are squalid
little Kaisers in every Australian State who
hate their fellows as fiercely as William
ever did the French or the English, and who
consider such emotions creditable, if indeed
they are not of divine origin. What is the
real difference between the Imperial Peck-
sniff and the religious or political lleep?
Mainly that the former is born and so can’t
help it, while the others are made by the
modern clerical and party systems.

In a series of essays collected by Professor
Meredith Atkinson, and published in book
form, a striking tribute is paid to the climate
of inland Australia. On the authority of
Griffith Taylor, Professor of Geography
at Sydney Uni., the most agreeable part of
the Commonwealth to live in, climatically
speaking, is not Sydney nor Melbourne nor
any other coastal capital, but Coolgardie
(W.A.), and Alice Springs (N.T.)' runs it
close. Judged by comparative readings of
the wet-bulb thermometer, Coolgardie has
seven months of perfect weather, and only
five months which are “sometimes uncom-
fortable” — i.e., there may be from one to
five uncomfortable days in the month. It
is warm, of course, but the atmosphere is
dry and bracing—in fact, it is admirably
suited to normal people who neither eat nor
drink over-heavily and who wash their bodies
regularly. In the scale of climatic comfort
Coolgardie is ahead of Hobart,
Sydney, Perth and Brisbane—and of
London and New York as well. There was
a sanatorium for consumptives at Coolgardie
a few years ago. The buildings were rather
primitive, but the air and locality were con-
genial to most of the patients (generally
miners from Kalgoorlie and further-out gold-
fields), and there was an encouraging record
of cures. But along came a Government
which had a rush of centralisation to the
head. At an expenditure of about a quarter
of a million it shifted the sanatorium 300-
odd miles nearer Perth, raising a huge pile
of bricks in a settlement with a 30-inch
rainfall, elevated certainly, but not high
enough and too near the coast to have the
quality of mountain air. From time to
time there have been complaints that the
place is too cold and dank for patients from
the interior, but the Government has. always
defended itself, after the loose and illogical
fashion of Governments, by referring to
w’kat the sanatorium cost, as if that ended
the case. Now Science arises and writes
the Government down an ass.

POLITICAL
POINTS
In 14 hours the Vic. Leg. Assembly passed
11 bills, debated Estimates and loans total-
ling between £18,000,000 and £19,000,000,
agreed to everything, adopted an Appropria-
tion Bill giving nearly five months’ supplies,
woke up from the improvised beds on the
benches and went home. Premier Lawson
said “a record had been established in dis-
posing of the Estimates at one sitting.”
National accounts were put through without
inquiry, without explanation, without chal-
lenge. Nearly every line was increased.
Loans were passed for £250,000 worth of
new schools which ought to be paid for out
of revenue, and an imaginary surplus of
£236,000 was distributed in largesse, other-
wise bribes to constituencies. The Cabinet
in effect Jold members. “Until you pass
everything we put before you. we will not
bring forward the bill to increase your
salaries. Now, swallow!” And they swal-
lowed.
From the Federal Gallery
Andrew Fisher’s imminent return to Australia is
starting a host of conjectures. Some who claim to
know declare that he has drifted away politically
from his former pals and could not re-enter politics
as a colleague of Ryan. On the other hand, various
Reps, assert that he is still the old Andrew who will
accept £lOOO a year if a Labor seat can be found
for him. The matter of finding him a billet has already
been discussed in the Labor party, and it is suggested
that it wouldn’t be a bad thing to stand him for
Bendigo, if that seat is vacated. For Hughes is now
first favorite for Fisher’s billet in London, though
if ultimately he does decide for the big chair at Aus-
tralia House he certainly won’t be content with the
shadowy power of his predecessor.
John Storey, N.S.W. Labor Premier with-
out portfolio, with his £2445 a year and ins
motor-car, now gets as much as the Prime
Minister of Canada (_8,000,000 people), and
the Prime Minister of Canada attends
to a department. He gets as much as any
U.S. Secretary of State with 100,000,000
folk to look after, and there are only 10
of them, as against 13 Ministers in N. S.
Wales. Also, his screw' beats that of the
President of Switzerland (population
4,000,000) by 5 to 2. That is what they
call “facing the future with optimism and
confidence.”
The Lloyd George Government has refused
to vise the passports of a Yankee committee
—largely pro-British—w-hose members
“wished to visit Ireland to gather first-hand
information of the situation there.” The
applicants- were told that “investigation
would be futile until quiet was restored in
Ireland, and then only by a body highly
experienced in the laws of evidence, and able
to compel the production of books, papers
and records.” Unfortunately, as the Ameri-
cans are sure to recall, this in substance
was the identical reason given to them by
the Germans during 1915 w’hy they shouldn’t
investigate the situation in the neighborhood
of Brussels. What the world wants in such
cases is not strict legal proof of certain
atrocities alleged by one side or the other,
but a picture of the way the people are
being treated and the response they are
making to such treatment. The lines on
which the Americans, and particularly the
anti-British ones, are likely to argue is
that Lloyd George and his colleagues won’t
let foreign investigators into Ireland because
they are ashamed to. It is a suspicion
which delights the readers of the Ilearst
newspapers, and inspires one type of Eng-
lishman ivitli dismay and another with
shame.
On the significance of Kalgoorlie—
Except for a small coastal strip, Kalgoorlie is
wholly a mining electorate, and it used to be a gift
for Labor. From 1903 onward it returned an un-
broken succession of Labor Representatives ; in 1911
and again in 1914 it sent a solid Labor 10 (i.e., one-
fifth of the House) into the State Assembly. Its
power was such that it made and unmade Ministries.
But the internationalists used Conscription to split
Labor, and the Mahon episode has, if anything,
widened the breach. Since 1917 there has been a
National Labor Party, supported mainly by Cousin
Jack miners from Ballarat and Bendigo, and although
all sorts of things have been done to tempt, or
force, it back into the fold, it stubbornly maintains
its separate identity and strength. Some day, wheit
Irish and other foreign politics cease to divide
Australian working-men. the two factors may come
together again, but meantime the Westralian A.L.P.
will remain a ragged and rather depressing Opposi-
tion.
Alderman Bramston, of Sydney Municipal
Council, recently stated in tlie Herald “why
he is a republican.” He is tired of being
“under autonomy” to England, and sees no
THE PREMIER RECEIVES A DEPUTATION.
“Visitors to State Parliament House were surprised to see in the vestibule a congregation of about
40 women, some carrying babies in their arms and with children of tender years clasping their skirts.
Mr. Storey (to Dr. Arthur): ‘You deluded these women.’ Dr. Arthur: ‘I’ll deal with their case after
I’ve dealt with you.’ (Uproar.) Mr. Mutch: ‘You’re a damned humbug!’ Mr. Storey: ‘You sent a
dozen women in a state of pregnancy to my home from Newtown.’ Dr. Arthur: ‘lf you had acted as
you promised to act that would not have been necessary.’”
danger in starting a republic with 5,000,000
people and no defences, his party being
against “militarism,” root and branch. “In
the event of the Republic being plunged in
war,” said Bramston. “she would probably
look for assistance where Britain did in the
last war, namely, the assistance of the re-
publics of France and America, and not to
the obsolete monarchies of Europe.” Which
is rather crowding the blunders. Britain
didn’t look to republican France for help;
it was France that looked to monarchical
Britain. If the effete monarchies of Serbia,
Russia (the effeti monarchy went the whole
hog for us, though the new republic w'ent
over to the enemy), Belgium, Italy, Rou-
mania and even Japan hadn't rushed in to
keep the pot boiling, the republic of America
would never have been in at all. The cause
of European democracy would have been
lost 24 months before the big, rich U.S. re-
public had made up its mind. It would be
a chill look out for a mild, unarmed, isolated
lamb of a republic alone in the Pacific
among colored wolves, depending for its
safety first on an utterly exhausted Euro-
pean State 13,000 miles away, and second
on a huge sluggard which stands out of the
League of Nations, which has its head-
quarters over 8000 miles away, and which
takes, even under savage provocation, 32
months to get its coat off.
From “The Oldest Inhabitant” apropos
Hughes’s £25,000 and the lily whiteness of
an old-time politician :
The N. S. Wales Supreme Court in its Bankruptcy
jurisdiction contains papers concerning one Henry
Parkes, filed many years ago. In 1887, the documents
show, he-owed George AVigram Allen £9344, secured
upon Faulconbridge Estate—a conditional purchase of
about 500 acres of Mountain land, with a small
weatherboard cottage thereon. This c.p. was a selec-
tion at £1 per acre, with residential clause. He
owed the Colonial Mutual Life £9OOO, and William
Clarke, Francis Abigail (both Ministers under
Parkes), James Angus, John Shepherd, Francis Tate,
A. IV. Sutton, Dr. Bowker, Watt, Deane and Leo-
pold Yates £2OO each, secured on property at North
Shore, and as to the Colonial Mutual upon 10 shares'
in the Holt-Sutherland Estate. This North Shore
property caused Parkes some trouble at election time.
One McNamara, who purchased and built on the
estate, was unsecured when the Colonial Mutual fore-
closed, and McNamara met Parkes at one of hjs
meetings and gave him a terrible time. To the City
Bank —secured upon property at Faulconbridge,
Coleridge, Ashfteld and Wentworth Falls —he owed
£6371 18s. 3d., with arrears of interest £5OOO ; to
the Bank of New South Wales, secured on property
at Jervis Bay, £4045; to the E. S. and A. C." Bank,
secured on property at Guildford, Moama and Canley
Vale, £2464; to Saul Samuel and John Frazer,
secured upon property at Coleridge and Jerilderie,
£2214; to the Commercial Banking Co. of Sydney,
secured on property at Springwood, £los9—a total
of £41,498, secured on land which would not realise
one-fifth of the amount. Now what “consideration,”
besides the land, was given for these advances?
The Ma State’s Billingsgative Assembly
has to do some deep sinking to get lower
down than usual, but the thing is managed
now and then. Last week there was a
deputation of allegedly-hungj;y feminines out-
side the House. Inside there was a flushed,
heated, half-suffocated Premier doing strange
semaphore antics and accusing a pale mem-
ber ( whom he referred to as “a shadowy
carcase”) of having sent 12 pregnant
women to his house to annoy him, and of
having also collected ladies who were about
to add to the population in the precincts of
Billingsgate House for the same purpose.
He urged that boiling (or at least scalding)
water should be poured over the pale mem-
ber. He said the latter was a canting
humbug and another Minister said he was
a damned humbug. The pale member, said
the Premier, from whom a steam, like wash-
ing-day arose, was given to vulgar abuse and
had a guilty conscience. /Meanwhile a dozen
members hurried out to interview the ladies
who were about to add to the population.
Nothing really happened except fishfaggery,
but if the scene had been laid in the street,
where traces of gentlemanly instinct still
survive, there might have been an al'rest or
tw r o.
Of course. The Vic. W.C.T.U. is agitat-
ing now to have shops that sell soft stuff
closed at 6 p.m.
The funeral of the Vic. (State) Fair
Profits Commission will take place on
December 31. The bill to keep it alive was
abandoned. Except among the bureaucrats,
there will be hardly a mourner at the grave.
Thirteen has proved an unlucky number
for the Hayseeds in the Vic. Assembly all
right. The first time the party wanted its
full voting strength Wettenhall was laid up
with appendicitis. Now Mackrell has been
unseated because his nomination was not in
order. Mackrell was outed, by the .way, at
the instance of one Whiting, who was the.
Liberal candidate. Whiting, however, does
not get any - immediate advantage, as the
whole election has been vojded.
“Scrutin” : It is time the returning-oflicer
system for Vic. State elections was changed.
At present the sitting member nominates
a man who is accepted by the Chief Secfe-
tary. He is unpaid, but he usually ap-
points a chief substitute, who is paid, as
well as the deputies, poll-clerks and so on.
Some of the deputies and poll-clerks chosen
are about as unsuitable as they possibly
could be. They are often slow and un-
reliable, and almost hopeless with a preferen-
tial system of counting. The responsible
officer .should be a Government official who
can be carpeted if things are not up to
full requirements. The present honorary
system was copied from Britain. In theory
the official is supposed to be a high-minded
patriot with a judicial temperament, whose
casting vote in the case of a tie would be
accepted without murmur, but it is only
so in theory. There has been more than
one instance in which the r.o. has even
whacked with his chief deputy what the
deputy has drawn as fee or salary.
It was Dick Toutcher who originated the
movement in the Vic. Assembly in 1911) for
the increase of members’ screws from £3OO
to £5OO. and naturally it was left to him
to create a blank in Lawson’s bill, so that
something more than the £450 promised on
the hustings could be inserted. Seeing that the
numbers were up Lawson made no demur to
the creation of the blank, and then £5OO
was fixed on his own motion. Having to
keep his election pledge against an increase
lawyer Eggleston was the only one who
crossed to the Opposition side when the divi-
sion was taken on the second reading, but
lie did not carry his dissent to the extent
of repeating his virtuous act on the third
reading. McLaclilan (who wanted the
figure made £400) and Allison, the Hay-
seed who outed Minister Hutchinson, were
the two who stood out all through. An
effort by Prendergast to get a couple of
hundred each for members of the othah
Chambah was ruled out of ordali.
Not long ago Premier Storey moodily
observed that there might have to be a
Black Wednesday in N. S. Wales. That
must have been about the time, as was
stated in the House last week (and John
didn’t deny it), that the pessimist got rid
of his property in Drummoyne. But nowa-
days he is bubbling over with optimism of
the gaseous sort. Last week he (1) publicly
rebuked his Minister' of Agriculture for cir-
culating “panicky reports about the effects
of the rain on the wheat crop,” (2) was
“delighted to read” the worked-up enthusiasm
of a land agent who is obviously afraid that
the boom is about to burst, and (3) joy-
ously intimated that all was for the best
in the best of all worlds. In the mean-
time John had decided to present himself
with a rise of £lB a week, retrospective for
two months, and it’s wonderful what a dif-
ference a little thing like that can make.
The High Court has vetoed the Customs
plan of charging duty on foreign goods with-
out regard to the market rate of exchange.
The countries principally affected are
France, the U.S. A. and Japan. On U.S.A.’s
goods, with the pound worth only 3.60 dol-
lars, a 25 p.c. duty (on the invoice price
plus 10 p.c.) means £27 10s. By the old
Customs plan only £2O 7s. 4d. was collected.
Japan, on a similar transaction, will pay
£9 14s. more—£27 10s. instead of £l7 16s.
On the other hand France will get a fairer
deal than it has had lately. Taking the £1
sterling as worth 584 francs, 25 p.c. duty on
£lOO would be £27 10s. The practice of the
Customs people up to the present was to
charge £63 15s. 3d. on the ancient value of
the pound—viz., 25.23 francs. The differ-
ence was £36 ss. 3d., which choked French
import business. Importers are asking one
another whether they ought to sue the Cus-
toms Department for return of excess duties
paid in the past. Their chance of recovery
is Buckley’s, not to mention his old part-
ner, Nunn.

THE
CHACING
FATE.
[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
She stood some fifty years at France’s gate
Alert, remorseless—cool and grim as Fate;
She bared her fangs for fight from time to time
And boasted of her plunder and her crime;
And begged the frowning Heavens to duly note
Her dearest prayer was blood and France’s throat;
And dared to hail, as Deutschland’s champion, Him
Who rules the Vault above the Seraphim;
And quite believed her Kaiser’s will and nod
Were half his own and half the Voice of God.
To-day she sits in ashes, bent and pale;
Her children shiver at the wintry gale;
Her men have lost their blood-lust and their pride,
Her women wander, gaunt and hollow-eyed;
Her legions melt away, her haughty fleet
Has cowered and sunk before Britannia’s feet.
And, watching there beside the storied Rhine,
Her banded foemen stand in serried line,
And Gallia Victrix, stern and proud and flushed,
To-day is Warder o’er Germania crushed;
And keepeth guard in turn at Deutschland’s gate
As Vengeance hath decreed, and Iron Fate!

The Bank of N. S. Wales closed its latest
accounts with a record profit and in unpre-
cedented conditions. During recent months
a marked change has taken place; and the
first small crack in the boom bubble has
shown up. So desperate have become the
prospects for some people who have fattened
on the abnormal conditions of recent years
that they are trying to sustain the boom a
little longer with the cry that all is well,
that money has never before been so plenti-
ful and that our “boundless resources” are
going to see us through, and that we should
face the future with optimism and confi-
dence, which unfortunately have to a great
extent become synonyms for extravagance
and loafing. Illusions as to the nature of
the boom are hard to dispel while the public
still has some of Joe Cook’s paper in its
pocket. But part of the illusion is at last
becoming apparent: the re-action of war-
finance is beginning to make itself felt. The
wonder is that the apparent prosperity has
continued so long; nobody but a fool or a
designing rogue could pretend that after six
years of war conditions, during which time
a handful of people, many of them with-
drawn from active production, spent hun-
dreds of millions in "helping to down the
Hun, could emerge from the experience more
prosperous than when they embarked on it.
Yet for half a dozen years we have been
behaving as though it paid to engage in
expensive modern warfare.
While we have been indulging heavily in
expensive imported luxuries and running up
city and suburban land values to unpre-
cedented levels, this is wdiat has happened.
The Federal public debt has leaped from
19 millions to over 400 millions; and in
the five years to June, 1919, State debts
moved from 3171 millions to over 396 mil-
lions. In these figures lies the secret of our
supposed “boundless prosperity” : instead of
attempting to make - a reasonable effort to
pay a substantial part of our war expenses
as we went, an over-supply of optimism and
the curse of party politics left the payment
of the bill to the future, while, in keeping
with old-acquired habits. Uncle has been
tapped for many of our ordinary national
requirements. The wmight of war has not
yet been felt by the public: more paper and
still more paper has swollen bank deposits,
and generally maintained the illusion of the
“heaps of money” lying around. The accumu-
lation of paper wealth is one side of the
balance-sheet: on the other is the increase
of debt per head from £66 in 1.914 to £135
in 1919, and all the borrowings since June,
1919, have to be added to that figure.
If during the years of the Great Trouble
the Commonwealth had done so magnificently
with its products that a large balance of
trade had resulted in our favor, and if with
that gift we had attempted to meet a reason-
able proportion of our current liabilities, the
future would have been sound without having
to mortgage our ’’boundless l’esources,” which
are aarain beine haw'ked in the way that every
improvident politician has exploited them in
the past. Though we did fairly well with our
wool and metals and indifferently wrnll with
our wheat, owing to heavier importations the
surplus of exports over imports has averaged
only £3 ISs. 6d. per head of population over
the past five years, which contrasts very un-
favorably with the growth of the public debt
per head. Much of that new debt is external :
1021 millions of the Commonwealth’s liabili-
ties ""since 1914 and 34| millions of new State
borrowings wmre incurred at the other end of
the world, and these twm increases at even_ 5
p.c. interest means an additional seven mil-
lions or thereabouts per annum to be paid
overseas. Meantime renewal of .old foreign
loans in a dear money market is adding to
the burden. With produce markets declining
heavily it requires more than extravagance
and loafing (the other names for optimism
and confidence) to meet the troubles ahead.
The curtailing of imports, particularly of
luxuries, strict economy in both public and
private finance, and a determination to get to
work and unload the huge debts and their
crushing interest bill can alone save the
Commonwealth from experiencing an ex-
tremely anxious period, if not something
worse.
Like all other traders, the dealers in money
have had a wonderful time during recent
years. The Bank of -N. S. Wales has nearly 10
millions more of deposits than it had five
years ago to help its earnings. To preserve a
reasonable balance between its own funds
and outside liabilities, £1,431.000 new capital
has been got in, and accumulated profits have
meantime grown by over £BOB,OOO. How all
this additional -money has been put to work is
shown hereunder: —

So at September 30 last this bank had over
£13,690,000 more advanced to clients and
£3,829,000 more invested —nearly all in high-
interest war' loans —than in 1915. Though
the aggregate of liquid assets is smaller than
it was five years ago, the Wales’s position
is sound. Besides the figures set out above
there is included among the advances over
lit million loaned to customers on account
of the wheat pool and to finance the War
Loan subscriptions. Ilegarding these as
liquid, the bank held over 50 p.c. of its total
liabilities in more or less handy form,
though^the liquid assets of to-day are not
of 1915 quality because of the quantity
of Government paper held. Still, behind
that paper is the entire credit of the Com-
monwealth. The proportion is smaller
than usual because of the two millions
advanced to help producers over the drought
and the additional three millions advanced
to finance heavy importations. The new
capital got in during the past year has
improved the relation of funds to liabilities:
capital and reserves at Sept. 30 totalled
£8,450,483 (deducting current divs.), equal
to £7 4s. 3d. of liabilities for each £ of the
bank’s own funds. That was an improve-
ment of 12s. compared with a year pre-
viously.

This is not a talkative co., and the man-
agement proffers no , explanation of the
violent fluctuations of profits. As the table
shows, frozen meat has been an erratic
trade, profits depending on the vagaries of
the seasons and overseas markets. The very
favorable conditions which followed upon
the Armistice were, of course, responsible
for 1919’s very fat £80,815, whiyh gave a
return on ordinary capital of over 66 p.c.
The £43,331 for the past year looks a very
handsome return on the paid capital of
£212,500. £lOO,OOO of which is 6 p.c. pref.
stuff; but the return is not nearly so glit-
tering when the magnitude of all share-
holders’ funds in the business is considered.
Accumulated profits now fall short of paid
capital by only a couple of thousands. On
the total funds of £422,900 the past year’s
disclosed net profit gave a return of only
slightly over 10 p.c., or, considered solely
from the point of view of ordinary share-
holders. about Hi p.c. on their total in-
terest in the business. Still, the £43,331
shown by the directors may not represent
the full measure of the past year’s profits:
the figures presented are less provision for
taxation and depreciation allowances, both
of which may have been over-liberal. War
loans, for instance, have been written down
by a visible £5OOO.
Since the Imperial Government became
interested in Maoriland meat, big changes
have shown up in this Canterbury co.’s
balance-sheets: —
1910. 1915. 1919. 1920.
Liabilities .. £96,115 £111,262 £636,197 £519,840
Works and other
fixed assets 274,792 282,328 305,888 315,290
Stocks, debts, etc. 73,686 169,337 753,803 641,705
After 12 months of war the co.’s interest
in shipments and advances to producers
totalled £78,382, other book debts amounted
to £20,193, while stocks were given a value
of £55,145. In place of the co.’s own
advances to growers, the former item now
displays “payments on behalf of Imperial
Government,” which, together with stocks,
lias swollen the entry to £515,995. Other
book debts have advanced to £80,707. As a
set-off against this expansion of assets is
the movement of liabilities shown in the
first line of the comparison above. The
actual position of the co. cannot be guaran-
teed from the published balance-sheet
figures. Considerable additions to works
and plant have been made during recent
years, and on what basis these additions
have been taken credit for is not clear.
More than likely during the years of great
prosperity there has been hard writing
down. The visible improvement over the
past two five-year periods can be ascertained
in this way: Excess of liabilities over liquid
assets in 1910. £22,429; surplus liquid
assets in 1915, £58.075 —-a betterment in the
liquid position of £80,504. The surplus at
the latest balance had grown to £121,865, a
further improvement of £63,790. But
whereas during the former period the book
value of fixed assets advanced by only £7536,
during the past five years £32,962 has been
added. Between 1910-15 £25,123 of new
capital was got in, and the co.’s position was
built up with accumulated profit by £62,917.
A further £3650 of capital his since been
got in, and stored-up profit has added £93,102.
And while the past five years improved the
co.’s position by over £30,000 more than in
the earlier quinquennium, £30,000 or so more
has been distributed among shareholders since
1915 than during the 1910-15 period.

This Sydney printing-house has made a re-
markable recovery during the past six years.
Earle Hermann had a finger in the float of
the co. which took over W. E. Smith’s old
business, and the table shows what a sick
baby the shareholders had to nurse for a
time. The old troubles are of no moment
now, but after weighing up the position in
1914 the directors rightly decided to
straighten out the co.’s affairs by writing
down assets to their true value. In this
process £30,060 of capital—Bs. per £1 share
—was written off, the £9OOO of goodwill
then standing in the balance-sheet being
dumped. Meantime, they had reorganised
the management and put a capable costing
accountant in control. Profits soon looked
up, and the improvement has been so rapid
that this year directors decided that the
prospects of good profits were so bright that
a reconstruction was advisable. So they
had plant revalued, and that item has appa-
rently been written up by about £33,800.
Writing down for depreciation had seem-
ingly been liberal, and as printing-plant is
about treble its pre-war price, the valuers
had little trouble in finding a big margin
over and above former written-down book
values. In addition to capitalising [this
book surplus, the directors also transferred
the £12.590 of visible reserves to capital, and
also decided to re-instate goodwill as an
asset, that item now standing in the books
at £7522. The result is that paid capital has
been increased from £45,000 to £lOO,OOO,
thus replacing Bs. per share written off and
adding the equivalent of another 6s. Bd.
For every three 12s. paid shares in the old
co. shareholders have four £1 fully-paids in
the new concern. The latest disclosed pro-
fits are handsome, giving a return of 124
p.c. on the enlarged capital, and since only
8 p.c. divs are being distributed there is a
good margin of profit available for reserves,
£4594 of the £7522 book value of goodwill
already having been replaced by tangible
assets. The resuscitation of the did busi-
ness has been a fine achievement: indeed,
it must be somewhat of a shock to' the
people who only four years ago valued the
eo.’s shares at 4s t to discover that it is
now paying divs. at the rate of over 2s.
per share on that former holding. It is
another evidence of how much the standing
of a public co. depends upon management.
The printing trade is not an easy one, but
this co. now seems to have developed costing
to a fine art. Given a continuance of good
management everything should work out
well; there is a growing demand on the
printing-presses, and, owing to almost pro-
hibitive cost of new plant, the old-established
cos. are not threatened with greater compe-
tition than they have experienced in the past.

During the March half costs bolted and the
loss almost equalled the average profit for
the previous four terms. Towards the close
of that disastrous run the management re-
adjusted its tariffs, and now a good margin
of profit again appears. But of the £3222
shown above £1045 represents additions to
a depreciation reserve, and if that was merely
a set-off against current wear and tear,
actual profits, on the basis of stocks “care-
fully taken,” were £2177. That represents
a return equal to almost 18 p.c. p.a. on
paid capital. But shareholders get no div.,
practically the whole of profits going to
retrieve lost ground. Anyhow, the man-
agement has been so busy laying out funds
to secure additional outlets for the factory
output that it is questionable whether the
directors could have made a distribution if
they had wanted to. During the past year
four new branches have been opened—two
commodious city cafes —and the equipment
of these leaseholds has advanced the book
value of plant and fittings from £12,813 to
£20.910. Liquid assets (which still include
£5OOO of War Loan) have been cut into to
the extent of only a couple of thousands
to finance these additions, but meantime lia-
bilities have expanded £B6OO, the total
amount owing to outsiders now exceeding
shareholders’ funds by £6582. A view of how
the liquid position has moved since the first
balance after the clean-up 2$ years ago is
given hereunder : —•
Mar.,’lB. Sept.,’l9. Sept.,’2o.
Liquid assets .. £11,159 £26,439 £24,276
Liabilities . . 12,330 25,804 34,413
Excess liabilities .. £1,171 £10,138
Surplus assets . . £635
Paid capital is £24,500, and no less than
£38,220 is now in the factory and plant
and in shop equipment, and as reserves total
only £3331 the co. has to lean heavily on
outsiders. The nature of the liabilities is
not made clear; but, anyhow, the heavy load
of debt is not an ornament to the accounts.
Indeed, if the catering business had a few
experiences like that of six months ago, the
co. misrht easily find itself in an awkward
position. It is a business of ups and downs,
but since the A.B.C. was put on to its feet
again in 1918 its new management has
shown that good profits are generally pos-
sible. During two years £3693 of surplus
profits was accumulated after paying 10 p.c.
divs. With its four new branches the man-
agement no doubt looks for even better results
once it can definitely control the balance of
ever-increasing costs and selling prices.
Goode, Durrant & Co., Ltd., softgoods-
warehousemen, of Adelaide and Westralia,
showed a net profit of £62,970 for the year
ended July. The prefs. got 6i p.c. and the
ordinaries 10 p.c., leaving a balance of
£23,242. Reserves now exceed £200,000.
This co. is one of the very few Australian
softgoods concerns registered in England
which have not shifted their headquarters to
the Commonwealth to escape double taxation
and other worries.
Railton-Latrobe Shale Co. has at last
interested new investors in its shale-mine
near Latrobe (Tas.), and has sold out to a
new co., which, it is said, will erect an up-
to-date retorting plant capable of treating
100,000 tons yearly. The new co. has con-
tracted to put through 100,000 tons a year
for 10 years, with an option of extension
for another 10 years.

Thfi HAMPDEN-CI.bNfcUBRY COPPER MINESj
Ltd. —Working profit for six months to
February, 1920, £74,471; working loss for
half ended August, £51,248. That is the
slide disclosed by the published accounts:
But those figures do not exhibit the true
results of operations for each term: Owing
to shipping strikes and other troubles: when
the February accounts were presented large
tonnages of blister had missed the high
market and had accumulated. In the middle
of June last, when the February accounts
were presented, the directors were' evidently
optimistic about the future of the. world’s
metal markets and considered it good enough
to take credit for stocks bn the basis of
electrolytic at £lOO per ton, less realisation
charges. Since then the market for the
metal has darkened and unsold accumula-
tions have grown. The directors are nc
longer justified in regarding £lOO as a fail
valuation, and they now include stocks on
the basis of electrolytic at only £B5; again
less realisation charges. This re-valuation
of metals of other terms still on hand has
resulted in the latest accounts being charged
with £36,900 written off stocks. Actually,
therefore, on the basis of electrolytic at £B5
the working loss for the past half was
£14,348, while £37*571 \Vas nearer the work-
ing profit earned in the previous term. If
Hampden-Cloncurry gets no more than £B5
for its product—and with London prices now
between £B6 and £BB immediate prospects for
realisation at an improved figure are not
bright—the past year’s sales and the £355.067
of metal on hand are going i;o give a working
surplus of only about £23,000, which disap-
pears altogether when depreciation and
office expenses are set against it. It is
easy, then, to understand the dilemma of Mt.
Morgan and others. There is a ray of hope;
though: the weakness of the market is due
chiefly to financial stringency overseas pre-
venting manufacturers holding even normal
stocks, and partly to European countries
still being more or less out of business. The
demand must recover sooner or later, and
with it prices, for obviously under latter-
day working conditions the world cannot
continue to be provided with the metal at
present prices. Nobody call guarantee when
the recovery will take place; meantime, it
is a question of how much longer furnaces
and mines can be kept at work,
Hampden-Oioncurry’s stocks of metal at
August 31, as mentioned above, were valued
at £355,067. To finance these accumulations
and provide for continuous working the co.
had run up an overdraft of £257,520 and
owed £83,800 besides. But even with the
reduced valuation of stocks there was still
a surplus of liquid assets over and above
liabilities of £.113,507, not including the
£50,000 interest in other cos., mostly Metal
Manufactures, Ltd. This liquid surplus is
£50,530 less than six months ago. From
g.-m. Erie Huntley comes the disquieting news
that he can no longer look to the Macgregor
mine for feed. That mine stood third on the
string of ore suppliers with 27,500 tons
crudes containing 1370 tons copper, besides
which there are between 60,000 and 70,000
tons going between 2 and 3 p.c. copper, which
Huntley says “may eventually be recovered
by some less costly process than smelting.”
Recently, however, he decided that the Mac-
gregor can no longer stand up to high costs,
and after having had £140,000 spent on its
equipment and given in return 44,246 tons
ore, that show is now being dismantled and
all plant remqved. The casting out of the
Macgregor apparently reduces visible smelt-
ing ore from 92,100 tons to 64,600 tons, and
the copper contents in sight from 6550 to
5180 tons. Besides these reserves there are
the 80,000 tons of Hampden and Pindora
silicious low-grade ores containing about
2500 tons copper. To close an indifferent
chapter in Hampden-Cloncurry’s story Erie
Huntley reports that “the improvement in
efficiency of labor, noted in my last report,
has not on the average been maintained.”
Chillagoe (Q.) directors have just pro-
duced belated accounts for the year to the
end of December last. The balance-sheet,
after the redemption of debentures following
upon the purchase of the railways and
smelters by the Queensland Government, is a
very lame affair. Paid capital is £595.103.
and liabilities are £45,639; this total of
£640,742 is represented by “deficiency of
assets and balance of working loss,”
£543,003, and assets with a book value of
£97.739, including the amount spent on de-
velopment at Mt. Mulligan. The Govern-
ment took over all assets except the Mt.
Mulligan coal-mine, 100 miles from Cairns,
which the co. is knocking into shape to pro-
duce ultimately 36,000 tons coke per annum.
The Government undertook to advance
£90,000 to help this work. Though mine
development is reported as entirely satisfac-
tory, not so the coking undertaking. In
June last the Board decided that financial
resources were insufficient, so London was
tapped with the object of providing means of
installing the complete 36,000-tons-per-
annum plant, and of liquidating the co.’s
debt to the Government. There is declared
to be “no insuperable difficulty” in the way
of securing the necessary.- But before mak-
ing an appeal the directors are awaiting the
results of developments in the tunnel which
has been driven on the No. 3 seam, which
superintending-engineer J. T. M atson de-
clares contains the best coking coal he has
ever seen, and which in his opinion will pro-
duce more than all the other seams togetiiei.
There is no longer a loss on production and
last month's output exceeded 2500 tons. At
the meeting to be held on the 28th 111 st.
shareholders are to be asked to authorise
the directors to undertake a badly-needed
reconstruction scheme.
Kangaroo iJilis tiiffield (Q.) is a fishy
place at present. The following mines and
claims are being worked : Shrimp, Rock Bod.
Sardine, Goldfish, Salmon, Bloater. The little
Sardine is the whale amongst ’em. d.he
miners have*so far jibbed at having a Shark
in the community. The Shrimp is getting a
move on and is now Crushing low-grade ore
froin the No, 1 opeu-ctit With the new o-h<l.
battery driven by sitetidn-gaS, Meantime an
additional 5-lid. is being erected. The Rock
Cod is really an old claim taken tip by George
Blakoe since the Sardine boom. It Was tried
15 years ago and abandoned, but the new
owner is so pleased with results from costeen-
ing that he has purchased and erected a small
mill on Dingo Creek. A trial crushing from ail
open-cut on the lode 10ft. deep gave a return
of 44 p.c. black tin. The lode here is sft. wide,
but "ill places costeens have exposed a lode
up to Oft. thick. Most of the ore exposed is
expected to fun from 3 to 4 p.c. tin, and the
prospect is gilt-edged, Nearly all the rich tin
shoots in this country run with the kaolin.
iVit, Coolon goldfield, outside of Clermont
(Q.), has been quiet, but the mines are look-
ing well, and when crushing facilities are
increased the field should show steady pro-
gress. Barclay’s Native Bear mine recently
cleaned up 3240 z. from 450 tons, and the
returns from cyaniding, estimated at an oz.
per ton, are yet to come. The shaft is down
100 ft. on the lode, which runs to 12ft. wide
in places; but the stone crushed has all come
from the 50ft. level and backs. Coolon’s
reward claim has been converted to a gold
lease and the owners are erecting a suction-
gas plant and 10-head of stamps. Quinn
Bros., of Charters Towers, are also putting
a 10-head battery on the Sydney, and have a
good paddock of ore awaiting crushing.
The high-grade cobalt-mine at Selwyn.
Mt. Elliott (Q.), has just shipped 50 tons
of ore to England as a start. Two shafts
are down over 100 ft. and expose a lode up
to 6ft. thick, averaging about 5 p.c. Cobalt.
The lode has been proved laterally for 500 ft.,
and developments have justified the opti-
mism of the owners.
The Venus mill, owned and run for many
years by old John Tilley in the boom years
at Charters Towers, and which was pur-
chased by the Government for a State bat-
tery, resumed crushing and dropped 15hd.
of stamps at the beginning of the month.
The 43 tons of ore in the paddock which,
as mentioned in a “Wild Cat” par. recently,
went over with the Titanic mine at Kangaroo
Hills IQ.) to the Brilliant Extended for
15000 gave tons of dressed tin valued at
about £7OO. »
During its six months’ campaign to
Oct. 30, New Langi Logan (Vic.) won
£12,136 of gold, called up another £2954 from
shareholders and went over £6OOO further to
the bad. The working account debit now
•exceeds £154.000 and machinery figures at
£20,000, so over £170,000 lies in the Langi
gutter with never an end to calls. Mackay’s
office produces a table showing an average
increase of 63.77 p.c. in mine wages since
1914; also, it tells how mine requisites have
jumped in price from 25 p.c. to 300 p.c. Pro-
bably it is correct to say that the mine could
give a profit if l|oz. dirt could be got to the
machines on the basis of 1914 costs. Rut Langi
shot its bolt because the main gutter when
opened up off No. 1 shaft either could not
or would not yield ground that would con-
sistently go an oz. per fathom. The war
did not take all the alluvial miners from
deep-lead shows; many of them went to
Brisbane or Broken Hill or anywhere else
where better housing and working conditions
existed, to say nothing of higher pay. That
Ararat did not offer decent working condi-
tions is the principal reason why Cpllins-
street big guns declined to join in trying to
straighten the kinks out of the mine. With
the pumps at No. 1 shaft pulling water for
years from the gutter down the lead and the
plant, at No. 2 off the Oathcart tributary
junction helping, the 3000 ft. of gutter bet
'tween the two shafts ought to be as dry afe
is needed. So it should be possible to mine
cheaply there, and if it be loz. 3dwt. wash
New Langi is not stranded. Is the ground
left because the. Langi gutter is patchy?
Three months’ extraction of drained wash
is to proceed without engaging in fresh
development work. This is to save calls.
The wash will come from the hank at the
junction of the two gutters, and if returns
keep low and labor is still shy even Mackay
admits that the position will require to be
seriously reviewed by snarehoiders prior to
the exhaustion of tde dry areas.
In the Vic. Assembly the other night
Beardmore read a ietier from engineer a..
G. Michel! challenging ttie accuracy of the
figures used by Gen. Monash, ot tne State's
brown coal electricity-generation enterprise,
when drawing comparisons between that
project and the Iviewa hydro-electric scheme.
i,a\\ son decided to appoint a select committee,
w'hich got to work next morning, and in
the evening presented its report expressing
approval of tire State scheme, and saying in
effect that Kiewa was also a fine thing but
very much for the future. Monash showed
up well before the select committee. Nobody
doubts the conscientiousness of Michell;
but, wittingly or unwittingly, he did a good
turn to MorwelL
“Hargo”: Why all this fuss about con-
verting Morwell brown coal into briquettes?
Thirty years ago J. Brache, who took a
lively interest in the opening up of the black
coal deposits at Coalville, a few miles from
Morwell, sent consignments of the brown
stuff to Germany, and received back the
finished article. Brache enthused over the
possibilities then ; for a long time he carried
briquettes about in his coat pockets, and pro-
duced them with or without provocation. I
believe (although I won’t swear to it) he
imported one of the machines which Mqnash
is now talking about; but the time was not
ripe, or Brache hadn’t the right brand of
influence, or the stinking-fish brigade was too
powerful. Anyhow, the field was squelched.
Albert Davey, the original leaseholder, and a
few others can testify to that if they can be
dug up.
Director Scarborough’s cable from Badak
to a co-adventurer —“Charlie seriously ill - ’
—lifts the corner of the curtain a bit. Did
the recipients of the message sell? The code
is of the type credited to Jolly, one of the
Broken Mill pioneers, who mystified all the
telegraph operators at the Barrier when wir-
ing to his principals: “Baby has a tooth,’’ or
“Margaret dangerously ill.’’ Of course, if
Scarborough did not go North as one of the
Badak Board, and was simply surmising in
advance of Boadle’s report, he had as much
right to tell his friends what he thought
about Badak as any man in Penang had to
cable his view. Scarborough’s frankness is
cheering, and seeing that he owns up to not
knowing anything about mining the everlast-
ing puzzle must be why he ever went to
Malaya, or why should his “Charlie seri-
ously ill” cable have been worth a pinch of
snuff to anyone. The best feature about
the present Badak position is that the Board
is ready to help the Government to clean
up the slate in Malaya as well as in Mel-
bourne. That should not take long if
Asiatic ways can be mastered.
Herbert J. Daley’s swan song at Hampton
Plains eight months back was that there was
no necessity to boom White Hope: it was one
of Nature’s mines. All he asked was that
White Hope should have a grade of 60s. in
the 1320 ft. of lode that should extend from
the northern fence to the southern wall. This
was a modest demand, especially when the
boosters in Adelaide and Melbourne were
claiming oz. to 3oz. stuff in every saltbush
patch embraced within pegs. Manager N. E.
Giblin now gives 10,000 tons of 15dwt. ore as
probable in the White Hope off the Discovery
and No. 2 shafts, and about 5000 tons of the
same grade at the No. 3 shaft with large
quantities of 7dwt. to Bdwt. ore close by. All
this stone is in the northern end of the block.
South, off No. 3 shaft, is poor stuff. But
Daley is not downhearted ; he opines that on
work done prospects are good, especially since
there is £54,000 hard cash in hand.
* * * *
During its last six months prospecting at
Kanowna and development at Westonia ate
up £5500 of Edna May Central’s income and
left a working loss for the term. The Hamp-
ton Plains boom and water at Westonia
drove the Central Board to follow' Dorrie
Doolette to Kanowna. But manager Wil-
liams is still cheerfully optimistic over the
Consols shoots in the eastern ground at
Westonia. They underlie fiat, and at the next
lift will be near the shaft; but, as worked,
they have never kept the wolf at bay.
Actual minihg costs averaged 30s. 104 d. per
ton last half-year, or adding development
and with no drainage charges to pay 455.
Bfd. per ton. This is fatal. Central’s
figures are a mining curiosity : Crushed and
treated, 141.000 tons ; gold, £241,254; divi-
dends paid, £12,000j cash and stores in hand,
£22,000.
Blythe River Iron Mines, Ltd., is approach-
ing the last gasp. Since the Commonwealth
Government turned down the deposits just
sufficient work has been done to comply with
labor conditions; but Wm. .Jamieson now
warns shareholders that unless additional
capital is soon forthcoming there will be an
inquest. The directors still declare that
there is “a large quantity of good ore of con-
siderable commercial value lying idle.” But
the co. can neither find a buyer of the pro-
perty nor work the deposits on its own
account. The balance-sheet drift was held
up last year by the £3OOO received from the
Commonwealth Government, but all that re-
mains in the cash-box is about £l2OO, a trifle
over a ha’-penny per £1 share.

•‘Blue Bill”: “Ting Ha” (B. 25/11/’2O)
sagaciously points out that the'rule-of-thumb
which I quoted (B. 23/9/’2O) for the specific
purpose of warning budding prospectors
against over-estimating the true thickness of
reefs with a shallow dip, does not hold for
steeply dipping reefs. He misses the point
that the need for the rule disappears with
steep reefs, where the width of outcrop
approximates the true thickness. In place
of the convenient little rule of multiplying
the outcrop width by the dip and dividing
by 60, he advocates a little mining. In the
example which I quoted, all that was
necessary (had I known “Ting Ila’s” method)
was a trench 12ft. long with a maximum
depth of 3ft. However, I am fed up with
trenches (especially 3ft. trenches), I hate
digging, and on this occasion I had a train
to catch; and even our Queensland trains
wouldn’t wait for “Ting Ha’s” “safest way.”
Since no one else has pointed it out I should
warn “Ting Ha” and others that the chief
weakness of the “60” rule is that the beginner
almost invariably over-estimates the dip.
Hence, the calculated thickness is usually
somewhat too generous.

SOCIETY
MINCHINBURY
The regular Christmas stoppage in the
shipping business has come about. The
immediate trouble centres round the stewards.
They are a fairly well-tipped race—the only
people on board ship whose wages are not
a sure test of their earnings, for no one tips
the captain and the chief engineer scorns
gratuities. They are, or were, working under
an agreement which has another year to run.
THE UNSELFISHNESS OF MAN.
THE WOMAN: “Is your affair with Wool-
bale's daughter off?”
THE MAN: “ Rather! He told me she could
make a fool of herself; but she wouldn't
get any cash.”
THE WOMAN: “And she turned you down?”
THE MAN: “Certainly; though I had a
deuce of a job to keep her from making
a fool of herself.”
Various concessions were made, but the dead-
lock came over the question whether the
eight hours comprising the day’s work should
be done inside 13J hours (say between 8
a.m. and 9.30 p.m.) or inside 15 hours (say
between 7 a.m. and 10 p.m.) The difficulty
of housing enough stewards and the practical
certainty that some other demand would
follow almost immediately upon surrender
made surrender hardly worth while—with
fewer passengers to give tips, their accommo-
dation being limited by the space required
for more crew, and with more stewards to
divide the tips, new trouble was certain.

A daughter of the poor, a new scholar at
a Port Melbourne Sunday-school, was found
to be a rather unruly member, and when the
girl teacher of her class had failed to get any
idea of right and wrong into her small brain,
the superintendent took her in hand. “Don’t
you want to go to Heaven?" asked the good
man with some asperity. The youngster gave
two seconds to thought, then replied: "Ain’t
you got any other places? Daddy’s gone to
Heaven !’’
* •* * *
The summing-up of a special commis-
sioner :
I have spent a fortnight travelling through N. S.
Wales wheat districts wherein great damage was sup-
posed to have been done by recent rainstorms, and
after careful appraisement put the average loss at most
probably not more than 10 p.c. and certainly not as
much as 15 p.c. And a great part of this wheat loss
is due not directly to the heavy rain, but to the
delay in stripping, which will result in bleached
grain (with loss of weight) and in shed grain.
Cocky is always disposed to take the gloomy view,
and there were those who grabbed the chance to
prepare the ground for hailstorm claims. As a matter
of fact, there was very little hailstorm; but with
an advanced crop it takes a good man to decide
whether the damage was done by wind and rain
(which is not covered by the hail policy) or by
hail. In scores of cases where there is doubt the
cos. give the cocky the benefit of it. Speaking
generally, the wheat will be of rather poorer
quality than it promised to be before the rain-
storms ; but the harvest should not be 10 p.c. below
the estimate. On the other band, a great quantity
of hay has been damaged—much has been ruined—
and many a farm neddy is going to sniff disdainfully
at his manger during the next 12 months.

“Yarra Bern”: Melbourne has its little
ironies. The Argus said in an impassioned
leader:—
The basic wage has been arrived at on an esti-
mate of the cost of living. liven as the report was
written the facts upon which it was based were
undergoing a change. Prices are not so high now
as they were a month ago. They will almost cer-
tainly be lower still in a few months.
And almost instantly Melbourne ’Erald
raised its price from Id. to «d., thus falling
into line with its Collins-street contemporary,
which is lid. five days of the week and 2d.
on Saturday.
n ‘‘Lance Private”: Like “Stronach" (B.
•'/ 12/10) I found the Tommies mostly good
chaps. When I landed at a convalescent
home in the Midlands with twopence, ten
lepta and half a piastre in my pocket, four
Woodbines kept me in forbidden beer until I
managed to raise the wind. Again, when
the five of us were in the taproom pouring
our last Is.. 7id. down our throats, a bag-
man came in and left 4s. in the bar to
quench our thirst on the morrow. The next
day I was absent, but on the following day
I found the four had gone thirsty until 1
returned, recognising that a share of the 4s.
was mine. Greater love hath no man than
this.

“Copabella”: His reason for stubbornly
clinging to a tenement after he had had
notice to quit was elicited from an
immovable tenant in Terang (Vic.)
Petty Sessions Court. He had,
he said, a hen sitting in the front
room, and nothing would induce
him to leave until she had safely
hatched out her brood and was fit
to travel. The argument appealed
to a country Bench which kept
fowls, and the house-owner being
willing, and an amicable arrange-
ment was reached and blessed by
the Court: it was agreed that the
hen, but not the tenant, should
stay until she was over her trouble,
and meantime the owner of the
house should watch over her, give
her bed and board, and do all pos-
sible to aid her to bring out a 100
p.c. chick-return. King Solomon
is said to have been heard writhing
with envy m his royal tomb when the deci-
sion was promulgated.

“Seno”-: More than likely that, following
the example of Sydney, Melbourne Univer-
sity will put up its fees to students at the
beginning of next academic year. Its appeal
for funds has been unsuccessful, not half
the required amount having been raised, and
next year there will be a greater influx of
new students than ever. The Melbourne
institution has none of the rich endowments
which have come the way of Svdnev, Adel-
aide and Brisbane ’Varsities, and it has a
lower scale of fees than any of them. In-
creased, charges are therefore necessary, and
they will work no great hardship on those
seeking admission. What is perplexing the
Uni. authorities more is whether or not
they should increase the length of the medi-
cal course by another year, making it six
instead of five. The heads of the medical
school say that five years is not long enough,
and that, in any case, the med. student has
to spend his. first year learning subjects not
strictly medical, such as chemistry, physics
and botany. There is a counter-proposal
that these subjects should be removed from
the medical curriculum, and that a student,
before admission to the Faculty of Medicine,
should be required to produce proof that he
has reached the Uni. standard in them. This
is the practice in the U.S.A., the result being
that the medical student is able to spend
a year longer at hospital work, which, after
all, is what counts when a man really gets
to his job of diagnosing and treating disease.
IT OFTEN HAPPENS.
“But was her voice powerful enough to fill the ballroom?”
“It was powerful enough to fill the supper-room, anyway
“ What —did she sing in the supper-room?”
“No, in the ballroom."
“Sixenate”: The argument the Seamen’s
Union is having with Thomas Walsh regard-
ing the . secretarial job which he refuses to
vacate is by no means unique: there have
been several parallel cases in the history
of N. S. Wales unionism. In one instance
a deposed secretary, assembling the neces-
sary quota of friends to sign a requisition,
summoned a special meeting, taking care
that his friends were notified and that his
enemies didn’t get their warning till it
was too late. The result was a gathering
which rescinded the resolution for his dis-
missal, formulated charges against all the
enemy officers and left him master of the
situation until the treasurer refused to sign
cheques. When a further meeting again
handed him the sack the defiant official
locked himself in the union office and awaited
developments, his supporters feeding him with
bread and cheese through the fanlight.
Finally three hefty opponents gained admit-
tance by strategy, pleading that they wanted
to pay the secretary their subscriptions. An
heroic struggle ensued, but the besieged was
overcome by numbers and had to surrender
the fort. >Even then, he returned later with
a cart and insisted on removing the furni-
ture, which. he had prudently bought in his
own name. He also varied the monotony
of shifting the props by punching the presi-
dent on the nose, and was himself decorated
with a black eye. As he retired with the last
chair he was heard to threaten that he would
settle the cows by establishing a new union,
but being menaced with a score of prosecu-
tions for assault and violent language he
thought better of it and faded out.
“Sandy”: I went to Tyrone, Gippsland,
for my 1919 holidays, because I was assured
that no one else on earth would go to
Tyrone. I stayed at Mrs. Bent’s, and after
a week explained that I would like to shift
a little further back, where fishing was said
to be good and game more plentiful, for a
fortnight or so. I was recommended to try
Billy Blackfish at Bilbool, and one of Mrs.
Bent’s sons drove me out. Billy Black-
fish lived in a two-roomed bark hut on the
edge of a creek, and the conspicuous things
about him were his undipped condition, his
poignant smell of fish and the fact that he
went always without boots. He welcomed
me, and a rate was fixed. Young Bent drove
off, leaving me, and Blackfish prepared the
evening meal. It was blackfish fried. I had
never seen such beautiful specimens. We
had smoked blackfish for breakfast. I
thought it delicious. For lunch we had
boiled blackfish. We had grilled blackfish
for tea. That was the daily round. In
three days I understood why my host was
called Billy Blackfisli. lie had a sack-
shaped net, which he set where the creek
narrowed between fwo rocks, and I once
saw him haul in half a cwt. of blackfish at
a time. The man had a lot of pigs, which
he fed with blackfish. “Why don’t you
keep cows?” I asked, longing for milk. “They
won’t eat ’em,” replied Blackfish. On the
fourth day I was back at Mrs. Bent’s at
Tyrone, having walked the whole way. Any-
thing to escape the loathly atmosphere of
blackfish. “Visitors last a week sometimes,”
commented the landlady, adding: “I stayed
a year.” “A year!” I gasped —“living on
blackfish?” “Yes. But then I’m his wife.”
The other day I saw a report of the divorce
of Mrs. Bent from William Bent, of Bilbool.
Desertion was the ground given. But I
know better —it was blackfish.
BOTH HAPPY.
“My hide’s in — I’ve just found a new maid,
Molly Molone.”

DOWN THE ROAD.
[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
ihe autumn weeds grow sere and dim that with late
summer glowed,
The evening skies' that blazed and laughed all weep
away to grey,
Gone are the comfits springtime brought, the bless-
ings youth bestowed ;
But still we troll a catch at need, and still we
trill a lay
As always we go singing down the road.
Love stands smiling as we go by
With a Heigh! and a Ho! and a What do we
care t
Beauty turns with a half-drawn sigh
For the very fine fellows that once we were.
And the sweet little girls with the sun in their
eyes
Tell each to each in a glad surprise
That yon knows a ballad and yon a fine ode
As we go singing a-down the road!
&o up, my hearties, while there’s time to squeeze a
dimpled chin !
There are lips to kiss sweet as lips we kissed in
the storied long-ago.
Oh, for the lips that fear no flame of love’s delicious
sin—
Dear lips of ladies who know our skill and all
our sadness know
As day dies and we sing the deep night in!
Death smiles wanly to see us pass
With a laugh and a shrug and the roll of an eye,
Each with his memories and each with his lass
And each with a sob for the hopes that die.
Step by step with our girls we plod
Staunchly and carelessly on to God,
No twinge of repentance to sting us or goad
As we go singing a-down the road!

From a city consulting-room :
The other day in Sydney, during the hearing of a
case through which an ex-patient tried (and failed)
- to get a few thousands from an X-ray specialist for
negligence, frequent mention was made of the Medical
Defence Union of N. S. Wales. I should judge that
the inference suggested was that the union is a body
of doctors banded together to protect the members
no matter what blunders and other infamies they may
commit. Really the name is the best tiling about it;
and, above all, it is non-militant —absurdly non-
militant. Fees are very small. One guinea per
annum for 20 years is all that is asked of a member;
after that time he is welcome to its assistance (if
it deserve that term), in case of need, for the rest
of his life. To hear the lawyers talk at the trial
one would have thought that the union was a fear-
some thing, having sabotage and direct action as
leading planks, and possessing a capital of at least
£1,000,000. Actually its funds now approximate
£lO,OOO. Nobody has a chance of making much of a
hole in this amount. The management is in the hands
of trustees, who will not promise pecuniary help be-
yond £6O, though I remember one or two very
special cases when the whole expenses were paid.
But to obtain the promise of anything at all the
defendant has to appear in propria persona, and state
his case to the trustees. ,

Acting probably on a hint from Yic. Pre-
mier Lawson, who is himself a member of
the club, the Melbourne C.T.A. has with-
drawn its letter containing a veiled threat
to expel Greenwood, M.L.A., for his remarks
about the late-hour drinking habits of clubs.
When the Premier informed the Assembly
of the climb-down of the bagmen’s executive,
the issue of Parliamentary privilege was
allowed to fade out. And no doubt, for his
part, and' after the manner of his kind,
Greenwood will do nothing more. For how
could the reformer live if there was nothing
left to reform?
“Lickpenny”: I had just been repaired
and was waiting at the base depot, Rouelles,
to be marked “A” again
and sent up for another
iron ration. The fel-
lows were very proud of
my French, and Sempkins
induced me to translate
and reply to the letters of
his “ cliere Louise” in
Le Havre. She wrote
beautifully and. forgetful
of Sempkins, I put into
the correspondence all the
Gascon fervor I have in-
herited from my Scotch
ancestors, and Louise, for
her part, told Sempkins
she had no idea he was
so “romanesque” till she
read his letters. At his
request I got my leave-

described as the most

“Whitehall” on the man from Monte
Carlo: —
Edmond Blanc, the well-known sportsman and
descendant of Prince Roland Napoleon, who died
last week in Paris, drew the whole of his immense
income from the Casino at Monte Carlo. \ arious
witticisms have been attributed to him, and most
of them dealt with the folly of gambling. When a
lady inquired which won oftener at Rouge et Noir,
the red or the black, he replied, “Red wins sometimes
and black wins sometimes, but Blanc [white] wins
always.” In his younger days he was sensitive about
the lurid reputation borne by the so-called “Bath
Club,” and the idea oi administering the viaticum
(in the form of a gift of cash) to a stone-broke
player on condition he went home is said to have
been conceived by Edmond ; also the device of putting
a large sum of money in the pocket of anyone who
committed suicide in the Principality. Neither did

“That’s the second time our wedding’s been
postponed, — we’ll never have any luck.”
“Oh, if you are so superstitious as all that,
let’s postpone it again.”
much to respectabilise the business. Recipients of
jq )t , viaticum usually came back and played it up on
the tables> and there was an epidemic of bogus
suicides in the casino gardens. Blanc ceased to visit
Moilte Carlo sho rtly after the Cockney Jew Wells
broke the bank there as a preliminary to going to
gao i. Not that the breaking of the bank worried
b j m or anyone else connected with the Casino, but
about this period the Germans, newly-enriched by
Bismarck’s High Protection policy, began to crowd
to the Riviera, it was thus mined from the- stand-
point 0 f people of taste, and Edmond, Camille and
other members of the family concentrated on Paris,
Horses and a' hatred of all Germans were his chief
passions. The latter may have had something to do
with the fact that he was a lineal descendant of a
former king of Westphalia — Napoleon I.’s brother
Jerome.
NOT A BIT WHAT HE EXPECTED.
THE ARTIST (trying to be unassuming):
“Have you seen my latest infliction?”
HIS FRIEND : “Yes, I have —are you taking
anything for it?”
“Audio”: The French regarded base jobs
in a different light from the British. To
enjoy the comforts of home life while the
war was on a French officer had to swallow
a number of unpleasant things. ’ To start
with, a captain in a fighting unit was
addressed as “Le CapitaineJ’ while an officer
holding the same rank in a base job was called
orally and in writing “Monsieur le Capi-
taine,” the civilian prefix leaving no doubt
as to the nature of the duties he was en-
gaged in. Grade was (and is) indicated by
braid round the cap. The rank obtained in
the field is represented by plain bands; that
obtained in the back area by wavy ones like
a girl’s hair. It is one of the things they
order better in France.
“Skyrider” takes the blame: —
With every farmer from Tenterfield to the Vic-
torian border cursing the recent week of flood-rains
I shrink from confessing that I am to blame for the
whole dashed visitation, but remorse forces my hand.
It started, this uncanny curse of mine, years ago.
I was staying with a farmer near Richmond, in
Natal (S. Africa), and what they call a drought
there had been raging for three
months. One night at tea Cock-
burn told me the Zulu legend
concerning the aasvogel, or vul-
ture. It is said by the Zulus
(all the Bantu races believe it)
that if you kill an aasvogel and
suspend the body ill a running
stream, floods will follow. Next
day I was out with a gun down
along- the Illovo, and
managed to pot an
aasvogel. Seeing that
the country badly
needed rain I decided
to test the truth of
the legend, and hung
the corpse in the fork
of a tree, the head of
the bird touching the
water. Next morning,
when I awoke, rain
was coming down in
torrents. I began to
believe the Zulu yarn
then, and believed it
more at the end of
the week when I was
helping my host (to
rescue his cattle from
the Hooded Illovo.
Months ago 1 became
the possessor of a
quaint cat of vulture-
like propensities, and
remembering old times in Natal I called him
Aasvogel. He was a likeable little cuss, and I
shut my eyes to his wicked ways till the neighbors
began to complain about losing their chickens, and
then I decided that he must go. He was placed
gently in a bag, in company with a big stone, and
deposited in the river. That was on Tuesday, Decem-
ber 7, and it* rained for eight days. My next cat is
going to be called William.

“A.J.” : The fact that a Digger officer was
a good pal of the men occasionally put him
in an awkward position. It was “somewhere
in France” that this happened. The colonel,
the adjutant, and a host of lesser warriors
were peacefully roosting in the mess, when
General Glasgow arrived with fury in his eye
to mention that some blackguard in the
battalion had feloniously stolen and slain a
pig. The name and address of the culprit
were to be ascertained and handed in “on the
tool.” The Okl Man sent “The Dormouse”
to A company to investigate, and it happened
that Dormouse had made himself very
popular with A company. Before he could
announce his errand. Johnno, the cook, sidled
up to him and hissed in his ear: “Like a nice
bit er suckin’-pig fer lunch?” Poor Dormouse
was horrified, but contorted an eyelid and
said warningly. “You haven’t got any,
Johnno!” But Johnno didn’t drop to it.
“Haven’t I!” he roared, and before he could
be restrained he had swept the lid off a large
cauldron with a princely gesture and exposed
the porker.

“Rounds”: That Christmas Bulletin
illustrated yarn of the Government mine-
inspector and the rebellious Cousin -Jack put
me in mind of an experience 1 had at the
Vic. Lands Department when Harry Allan,
now Chief Clerk, was running an immigra-
tion movement. An almost middle-aged
couple came up to the first floor. Herself,
who was manifestly Number One, told me
how they had a bit of money and desired
to get a nice wee fa-r-rm, but not for dairy-
ing—which Himself, speaking up, said was
drudgery. I was impressed with the lona
fides of the couple, and listened, because I
knew how to put them on the right track.
“Yours is- a special case,” I said to Herself,
“and don’t you think you had better see
the Minister? She looked at me for a
moment, and then at Himself. “I never
thought to bring my lines,” she said. “But
we’ve been married eight years.”

“Macquarie Street,” on the accident to
Caruso: —
By cable we beard of a horde of physicians rushing
to Caruso’s dressing-room, after his sensational
breakdown -while singing in Donizetti’s opera,
“L’Elisir d’Amore,” familiar to Australian audiences
through its one delicious air, “Una furtiva lagrima,”
often sung by Balboni. It looks as if the spot-
diagnosis was responsible for the report that for
the future the great tenor would be on the mat as
far as singing was concerned. Caruso imagined that
he had developed a temporary huskiness and wished
to go on with the performance; all the same,
he must have felt a great deal more comfortable
AU-REVOIR!
SHE (to retiring police inspector): “I see you
were' given a dinner last night.”
HE: “Yes, all the crooks I’ve keen after for
the last twenty years were there!”
after he had spent some minutes in the chair of a
laryngologist, and had heard the verdict. By means
of a head-mirror, a laryngoscope and a good artificial
light, the vocal cords could be minutely inspected
and an exact diagnosis made, as well as the probable
duration of the affection. Caruso’s pearly-white
cords would have lost some of their brilliant lustre,
and a glimpse at these two bundles of shining white
fibrous tissue, which come into accurate apposition
on phonation and diverge widely on respiration,
would reveal the presence of minute haemorrhagic
spots on one or both of them, the condition being
fairly common in those who put undue strain on the
voice. The affection is known as submucous haemorr-
hage, and the symptoms after the initial voice-
failure would be local pain, liuskiness and irritability
of the larynx. Treatment would consist in complete
rest of the voice, soothing inhalations, the giving-up
of high living, and the banishment of alcohol and
tobacco for some months. After a month or so the
effused blood would become absorbea, and an inspec-
tion of the larynx with the laryngoscope would reveal
no trace of the accident. Of course the bleeding
would be likely to recur, so it is more than likely
that Caruso and the high C will not be on intimate
terms for three months at least.

[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
All bowered in fronded palms she rests beside
Her limpid highway of soft glimmering green ;
Summer with faery loom has wov’n a screen
Of jacaranda’s blue, the flaunting pride
Of purple bougainvillaea, the wide
Emerald of river lawns that sunward lean,
Red boughs of poinciana, and the sheen
Of drifting butterflies, a jewelled tide.
She is a city fair, steeped in the white
Clear sunlight of her hot and cloudless noon,
When all the air is filled with life and light,
And garden walks are sweet with flowers a-swoon ;
But she is wholly magic in the night
When flying-foxes cross the golden moon.

LILLA GORMHUILLE McKAY.
Alfred F. Brash gets a lesson :
It had been a fierce sweltering day and as the
packed tramcar ploughed its homeward way the
evening sea-breeze methodically returned the dust
which had piled south before the north gale during
the day. In Melbourne, lest the supply of dust
should give out, a thoughtful Tramway Board at
intervals sands the tracks.
Everyone on the overcrowded car was dust-
begrimed, flabby, listless and terse. All except the
fat, placid citizen on the front platform. His
neighbor, the exasperated-looking little man with
the bristly-whiskers and the carpenter’s bag, seemed
to have absorbed his share of fed-upness. Fat wore
pink, clean-shaved gills, a white vest and spats to
match.
The diminutive one eyed him disdainfully. He
didn’t seem to like him. He, seemed to resent the
spats. I wasn’t surprised therefore when, after a
lurch, he belligerently inquired of his large, well-
nourished neighbor: “ ’Ere, ’oo yer shovin’ ?”
White-Vest seemed to require notice of the ques-
tion. He continued to read his paper in placid con-
tent. He had his tram-legs and swayed gracefully
with the motion like a helmsman in a gale.
The grouchy bantam repeated: “ ’Oo yer shovin’?”
The placid person lowered his paper and gazed
down at him benignly. “You seem vexed,” he re-
marked affably.
“Well, yer shoved me.”
“How truly dreadful! ” murmured Spats.
“Yus, it is. There ain’t no need to shove.”
“You’re humorous.”
“ ’lJmerous ! I’ll. show yer whether I’m ’umerous
or not.”
“You are vexed.”
“And no wonder, bein’ shoved like that.”
“How truly dreadful!”
“By cripes—you shove me again, that’s all.”
“Oh, you are humorous!”
“ ’Ere', stow it. You can’t come shovin’ and push-
in’ as yer like.”
“You are vexed.”
“Yus, I am, and I’ll show yer in a minit.”
“How truly dreadful!”
The small gladiator began to show signs of wear
Perspiration made rivulets down his grimy' cheeks.
He danced from foot to foot in the confined space.
“Yah! Can’t yer say sumpin’, yer fat, blanky
parrot?”
“You are so humorous.”
“Now, see ’ere, you step offer this tram and I’il
knock ten different sorts of ’umor outer yer.”
“Oh, you are vexed!”
The little man frothed with rage. His voice rose
to a shrill scream.
“I’ll kill yer, yer blanky -——.”
“Oh, how truly dreadful!”
The little man opened his mouth, but no sound
came. His eyes glared in murderous madness.
Suddenly with a despairing shriek he hurled him-
self off the tram and dashed up a side street as if
pursued by ,a thousand devils.
The placid victor resumed his paper. Presently
he looked up and caught my admiring gaze.
“Young man,” he remarked to me as he descended
from the car with dignity, “if you can remember
those three simple rejoinders you will win any argu-
ment in the world.”

George Foley, Mahon’s opponent at Ival-
goorlie, comes from Victoria, and was a work-
ing miner until 1911, when he turned poli-
tician. There was a sporting flavor about his
resignation of his seat in the State Assembly,
but he knew what he was about. His salary
as a State M.L.A, was only £4OO a year,
he had a seat that he would hold with 'diffi-
culty, and there is to be a Westralian general
election in March or April; whereas an
M.H.R. draws £lOOO a year, and, barring
accidents, will not have to go before his con-
stituents till the end of 1922. In effect,
Foley took £2OOO to £lOO about his chance
of dishing the old member, and at the moment
of writing the wager looked reasonably safe.
“T.E.D.”: Calico Jimmy emerged from
his dust and cobwebs the other day with a
letter to show what his old god Parkes
thought of such gifts as Hughes has just
accepted. Well, in 18S9 I was licking
stamps for McMillan’s firm, McArthur
and Co., of York-street, and for a week
I addressed envelopes and enclosed circulars
soliciting contribu-
tions to a testi-
monial for the old
man. In all
£lO.OOO was gath-
ered in and handed
over, either t o
Henry or to his
creditors. That in
theory he disap-
proved of the gift
i s quite likely.
But, like another
old h umbu g,
though it hurt him
he took it. “As a
matter of princi-
ple he declined it.
As a matter of
p rin c i n_a 1 (and
interest) he
accepted it.
JOHN LANG, the
N.S. W. Treasurer,
who has an-
nounced increases
in income and most
other taxes.
On a man who is moving north :
F. C. Urquhart, who is going to administer the
Northern Territory (or try to) instead of the Queens-
lir.d Police Department, must be about the last of
the “officer-cadets” from whom the commissioned
ranks of the Bananaland police were recruited in the
rure-merino days. For rntwy years promotion to
inspectorships and so forth has been from the ranks,
as in other States; still, the old system produced
some good men who rose high in the service, notably
“Jacky- Jaeky” Ahern of the early Barc-oo and
Diamantina; “Black” Douglas, an ex-naval man
who made a big name at the Palmer rush and else-
where ; Johnstone, also famous in N.Q. : and Jack
White, brother of Brudenell White, the A.I.F. General.
Urquhart served his apprenticeship under Douglas in
the long-abolished “Black Police,” and, gradually
rising to Chief Inspector, succeeded Cahill when the
latter resigned the commissionership in 1916. Neither
Cahill nor Urquhart had too sweet a time with the
Ryan-Theodore crowd after their strenuous handling
of the tram strike in 1912 ; and that may have some-
thing to do with Urquhart’s migration. Powerful in
body and will, and not given to suffering fools gladly,
he will either do things in the N.T. or fail im-
pressively. Two men farther apart in mentality and
method than he and Staniforth Smith, the acting-
administrator, one cannot imagine.
W. .T. Magarey, dead in Adelaide at 80,
had been a martyr to rheumatism for years,
but before that was one of the city’s chief
pastoral and financial authorities. He was
on many directorates, and was chairman of
the Executor, Trustee and Agency Co, of
S.A. and of the British Broken Hill.
“Copy Boy” : George Lansbury. editor of
London Daily Herald, and one of the
leaders of the “left” wing of the British
Labor movement, who has been in the
public eye in connection with the
alleged acceptance of coin from the
Bolsheviks, .spent some years in Austra-
lia. With his wife, three children and a
younger brother he emigrated to Banana-
land in 1884, and
worked as stone-
breaker, slaught-
er er, farm-hand
and parcels-deliv-
ery man. Like
most of the trusted
British Labor
leaders, Lansbury
i s transparently
honest, but some-
what dull. Most
of those who know
him, even among
the Tories, accept
his assurance that
he was not aware
of the negotiations
for Russian aid to
the Herald, which
were being con-
ducted by Meynell
(son of poetess
Alice Meynell, and
himself a verse-
writ e r, jazz
expert, and, at the
time, director of
the Herald),
until a late stage
of the proceedings.
G. H. WISE
(Vic.). Postmaster-
General.
The £625 collected seven years ago from
Irish constitutional Home Rulers to send Dr.
O’Donnell to the opening of the Irish Parlia-
ment, after the passing of the Act which has
never been brought into operation, is to be
used for a dead-language scholarship and a
tombstone. Disregarding a suggestion that
the money might be given to the Irish Self-
Determination Fund, a meeting of subscribers
decided to establish an O’Donnell bursary in
Gaelic literature and history at a cost of
£525, and to spend the other £lOO on a Celtic
cross for the doctor’s grave.
Captain Frank Hurley, who has turned
the handle of his cinema-camera in a good
many out-of-the-way parts of the world, is
now working the Torres Strait and the Great
Barrier Reef for the Australian Board of
Missions. He hopes to get unique pictures of
the pearling and boche-de-mer industries and
is laden with special apparatus for photo-
graphing the great natural marine gardens of
the Barrier —probably the finest in the world.
The job will last seven months, and Hurley
had a bit of luck at the start. Just;
outside Townsville he came across a big
lugger that had been dismasted in a heavy
blow, and the camera began duty straight-
way on the picking-up and towing operations.
Where the A.J.F. brand of spirit and
initiative comes from. Two men, Kelly and
Stroud, were capsized out of a dinghy when
trying to change places during a squall off
Brighton (Vic.) on a recent Saturday morn-
ing. Stroud made unsuccessful attempts to
right the boat, then made for the beach ex-
hausted. Kelly couldn’t swim, but after
going under twice managed to get hold of the
boat and hang on. Then one Dethridge took
charge of the proceedings. lie sent a lad
named Richardson to the neighboring baths
for a lifebelt and someone else for a doctor.
While the belt was coming he stripped ; then
he and Richardson swam out with it, got
Kelly, and brought him safely in to the wait-
ing doctor. Dethridge. the G.0.C., is 12;
Richardson, his Chief of Staff, is nine,
Arthur Cotton, who used to sit for Frank-
lin in the Speck Assembly, has sunk into his
last sleep. His incorrigible somnolence was
wont to amuse his fellow-members, and on
one occasion they draped his recumbent form
in a sheet, lighted candles, and indulged in
a mock “wake.” The House was in a
sportive mood at that time, having only a
few’ days before banned the Mercury men
from the gallery for some alleged irreverence
in an editorial. It had its own ideas about
upholding the dignity of Parliament.
The memory of John Downer, K.C., Fed-
eral politician and Premier of South Aus.,
is to be kept up at his old school —St.
• Peter’s, Adelaide —by a scholarship which
will take a boy on to the University for
three years. It is on Rhodes lines, being-
given for distinction in literary subjects
coupled with athletics. Bednail, of the
school XI, is the first holder.
Outliving all his contemporaries, Hadley,
who was chief of Vic. Hansard staff 30
years ago. died last week. Howard Wil-
loughby (afterwards editor of the Argus)
and W. V. Robinson (afterwards Clerk of
the Assembly and Acting-Clerk of Parlia-
ments) were the original staff, and they
had to plug away hard enough in those
times, when there were no typists and no
assistants. Hadley lived to be 92.
“Squire” as a front name is less uncom-
mon than was generally supposed when
Squire Bancroft, the theatrical identity, was
knighted. A manufacturing identity who
died in Melbourne last week was Squire
Ivennon. of the Master Tanners’ Association.
His father was the first producer of chrome
leather in Australia, and the tannery busi-
ness that James Kennon started was con-
siderably developed by Squire, his son.
The question of how much a rich man’s
wife should have to live on if they separate
by agreement has been debated in the
Supreme Court of S. Aus.. The general
thing is to give her one-fifth of the joint
incomes. Penfold Hyland, the wine-grower,
offered his wife £2000; she claimed £4OOO.
and the award was £2500, the Court taking
into account that she has over £5OO of her
own. Hyland admitted that his last three
years’ income was £ll.BOO. £10.700 and
£20,600. “Compare the £2500 a year with
the salaries given by the State to those earn-
ing the highest emoluments,” said Chief
Justice Murray bv way of a hint to the
lady that she ought to regard herself as a
very lucky woman —or perhaps as a sugges-
tion that, in spite of his own wealth, he
feels like a Bolshevik himself sometimes.
Equally prominent as boot manufacturer
and at the Plebrew synagogue, Solomon
Saunders was one of Adelaide’s very useful
Jews. He started his Australian experience
on the Victorian gold diggings in 1855, but
presently made his home in S. Aus., where
he has held many offices among the Hebrew
community. He was over 82 at the end.
John Mack, who died lately at Glenelg
(S.A.). was one of the men who made the
growing of fruit and vegetables a profitable
industry in that State when the others were
still inclined to think it should be left to
Chinamen. He made Australian produce
well known over much of Asia and Africa,
and did a lot of travelling. He put in two
years at the Boer War. and was both
wounded and captured. He died at 66 after
a lingering illness.
The firm of Roberts and Allport, Hobart,
has put up a record for the Speck, and pro-
bably for Australasia, by chasing Costs con-
tinuously for a century. George Cart-
wright, the first duly qualified solicitor to
settle in Vandemonia. hung out his shingle
on December 9, 1820. There was no
Supreme Court in the island then, a Judge
coming down from Sydney occasionally ; but
when one was started by Judge Pedder in
1824 Cartwright was one of the four law-
yers placed on the roll. At the same time
he got hold of a block of ground at the
corner of Macquarie and Murray streets,
and the business has been carried on in the
same spot ever since. The first Allport.
Joseph, camfe into the business in 1832 and
John Roberts a little later. Now the firm
has sot back to the stage of having neither
a Roberts nor an Allport about it. being run
by Frederick Lodge and Eustace Maxwell.
Dr. Deeper, ex-warden of Trinity College,
succeeds Gyles Turner as president of Mel-
bourne Public Library Trustees. He may
now become so absorbed in books that he
may weary us less about Ulster.
Keith Smith, having got through his
aviation-lecture tour in Maoriland, has moved
to» Vancouver, on the way to England.
Brother Ross is already in the Cold Country.
The knighted brethren, by the way, 'don’t
display the prefix. Probably no two young-
men ever had less use for a title.
When old Robert Stanley, M.P. for the
Wimmera (Vic.), and Tipperary Metho-
dist, shoved first into politics, he invaded
Natimuk, where a local politician named
Hill decided him with the question. “Are
you in favor of a reform of the decalogue?”
Bob pretended to be puzzled, and then
shouted “Yes.” “Explain your answer,”
laughed Hill. “Right,” said Robert. “The
Ten Commandments, as they slitand, mean
Hell for you. Mr. Hill. Buck up and put
me in, an’ Oi’ll use me inflooence to alther
thim in. yer favor.” The audience rocked
with laughter, and Hill, who was a sport,
rose to promise Stanley his vote and influ-
ence.
Father O’Reilly, rector of St. John s
within the University of Sydney, has been
made a Doctor of Divinity by the Pope. So
long as he isn’t awarded the Nobel Peace
Prize no one will object on the score of
inappropriateness. He is remarkably well
equipped intellectually for the theological —
and political—controversies to \vhich he

turns a hind seeks the stream. Six feet
three in height, 15st. in weight, and the
possessor of a. stage hero’s countenance, he
does not look like a man who was once
given up by the doctors. Yet when he
arrived in Melbourne from England 20 years
ago he was supposed to have consumption,
and the illusion still persisted as late as
the period when he became president of St.
Stanislaus’ College, Bathurst (N.S.W.).
O’Reilly has one great asset: he can “smile
and smile and be a villain” —that is, from
the standpoint of a member of the L.O.L.
iNothing visibly annoys him. A less advan-
tageous feature, in the present state of
Empire politics, is his English accent. He
inadvertently contracted it in youth, as a
man might become afflicted with chronic
eczema or "corns, and has never managed to
tiing it off. He is a Sinn Feiner and has
voted -Labor for 15 years, chiefly because
his habit of mind impels him to seek the
side of the under-dog.
The South Aus. Government has several
places to fill. The Agent-Generalship is said
to Jiave. been declined by every member of
the Ministry in turn. Now Judge Buchanan
announces his retirement. He is 72, but has
been a lawyer only 36 years, having been an
auctioneer before that. His business ex-
perience brought him the position of Master
of the Supreme Court in IS9I, and he has
been a judge only four years.
“T.11.M.’ - ; Lieut. Ray Parer has had a
170-mile aerial jaunt to King Island. Two
Melbourne sporting men (Pearce and
Howard) accompanied him over the 45-
mile stretch of open sea between Cape Otway
and the Speeklet. The ’plane was borrowed
and old-fashioned, but it got there. It was
the first air-'bus to visit the island. At
any rate, old-man Hickmott, whose photo
was taken alongside it, avows that no other
specimen has been seen around during his
59 years’ residence on the fragment.
Accountant McLean, of the Vic. Educa-
tion Department, once, by half-a-dozen
words, remedied a wrong to thousands of
sweated school-teachers, fixing up a matter
which had been the despair of his predeces-
sors. Salaries payable on the 31st trickled
around to the teachers any time up to the
middle of the month. “Better call the staff
together, Mac, and make an appeal. It’s
too bad on the teachers,” said the retiring
accountant. Mac didn’t do any calling, but
waited for the 29th. In came the clerk
with the cheque for signature for the salaries
of the head-office staff. “I’ll sign this along
with the teachers’ cheques,” he remarked
casually. There were lights in the office
till 4 a.m., and everything was ready by
the 31st. Thereafter the teachers got their
cheques quite promptly.

OUT FROM FLISDERS-STREET.
[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
The ships are in the river, the river runs down
Past the solemn buildings of Melbourne town;
The river runs swiftly to meet the big sea —
But Jones and Brown and all of us
Must hurry home to save a fuss.
Must hurry home to tea!
A ship goes down the river; the gulls are in the sky,
A-wheeling like little dreams, wheeling white and
high ;
And she will be far out to-night where coast-lights
wink,
And stars slide down the heavens, ocean froth to
drink ;
And there will be a great wind playing on her ropes,
And round, glowing bubbles on the smooth water
slopes.
The lights will drown behind her, while her silver
wake
Writhes across the sliadow-sea like a shining snake;
There’ll be the throb of engines and the strong
screws’ churn ; 1
Red against the velvet the funnels’ mouths will burn ;
Seas will rock her gently, the night will wrap her
round,
For she’ll be plugging bravely, outward, outward
bound !
But the solemn, haunting river will still slide down
Past the stupid buildings of Melbourne town;
What avail is thinking of the green sea ?
It is not thus that peace is bred,
And so we'll merely go to bed
For we’ll have had our tea l

A Geelong (Vic.) man had one of the
queerest spins in the war. He was of Ger-
man extraction, but did his bit well with the
A.I.F. He has since learned that so many of
his relations in Germany were killed in the
unpleasantness that a title that he has
no use for has come to him as the next in
blood.
There are N. S. Wales politicians who con-
sider that Bagnall, M.L.A., should be sup-
pressed. Others appreciate him as a pro-
vider of opportunities for being absent from
the House. The ponderous person’s latest
attempt to achieve greatness is a resolution
that the Premier shall (Baggy is great on
“shalls”) convey to the British Priminister
the Billingsgative Assembly’s appreciation of
his efforts to preserve the integrity of the
British Empire. It is Bagnall’s sixth offence
this Parliament in the way of long-winded
abstract resolutions. But it has been a life-
long habit with him. Before he got into
Parliament he used to erupt in a similar
fashion at Labor councils and conferences.
Adelaide feels bound to have a statue
of Flinders, who explored most of the S.
Aus. coast, and, though he was never near
the site of the present capital, observed and
named Mount Lofty, just behind it, when
he was on Kangaroo Island. A fund has'
been started, the City Council has given
its warm approval, and Flinders is sure
to take his place soon alongside Sturt,
Stuart and Light.
“Ex-Dig.”: The rolls of the A.I.F. con-
tained some queer names. A man who had
to face Surgeon-General Ryan owned the
patronymic of Guttzer. One Halfaman was
a six-footer and broad in proportion. A
Coward won many decorations, and a Shik-
kar was conspicuously sober. There is also
a dinkum Digger called Bogus—he is an
R.S.L. official at Ivatoomba (N.S.W.) —and
on the books of the Repatriation Department
there is a Sustenance.

“Biologist” discourses on freaks:—
Talking abdut the Polish prodigy who plays dozens
of games of chess simultaneously and wins nearly
all of them, even against first-rate players, a con-
tributor the other day suggested that the youngster
was a reincarnation, and added: “When the young
Pole turns his attention to more serious things,
we may expect to hear of him as a mathematical
genius.” This inference is at variance with known
facts about marvel-boys. Child-calculators who could
often give answers to problems as fast as the figures
could be Set down include Ampere, Bidder, Buxton,
Colburn, Dase, Fuller, Gauss, Nangiamele, Mondeux,
Prolongeau, Stafford and Whately. The talent
appeared in some instances as early as three years ;
in all cases hut that of Bidder it faded with the
growth of intelligence; with Dase, who was almost
an idiot, it endured through life. Archbishop Whately
and Professor Stafford had wonderful calculating
power as infants ; but both lost it on going to school.
Whately became and remained a dunce at .mathe-
matics. At five Mozart displayed untaught ability
as a musician and composer, and his skill remained
till his death at 36; but he was childish in all
matters but his art. Thomas *Bethune, a negro,
blind and almost imbecile, without any instruction
was able at the first attempt to play on the piano
like a skilled performer any piece he had heard.
His talent did not improve with age, nor could
he be taught. These boys simply knew ; they could
not explain. The power has the traits of instinct,
and, like instinct, declines as reason develops; and
the gratuitous humbug plastered on the venerable
theory of transmigration is no more aid to explain
these facts than the prophecies of Mother Shipton.
The Bench was well represented in a
recent murder case in Auckland (M.L.).
The presiding Judge was Chief Justice
Robert Stout; the leading Crown counsel.
Martin. K.C., is an ex-Supreme Court
Judge: and prisoner was defended by O. E.

The McCallum family of S. Aus is the
kind that insurance companies love. It con-
sists of six sons and three daughters, all
natives of S. Aus.. and all living and in
good health. Dugald McCallum, of Pine
'Grove, near Millicent, is the eldest: he is
SO. The baby is 66.
E. J. Kavanagh, vice-president of the
N. S. W ales Executive Council, was secre-
tary to the Sydney Labor Council when the
Holman Government put him into its first
batch of nominees to the Uppish House. In
the Labor Council he was over-shadowed
by the more brilliant Cochran, but time has
brought its revenges. Earnest and pains-
taking. Kavanagh gets through his work in
the Superiah House very well, whereas
Cochran, about whom the highest hopes were
entertained, was never more than “the
member for the Rocks” whilst he was in
the Assembly.
The late Henry Gyles Turner, the Mel-
bourne literary banker, was a well-meaning
old gentleman of late years, with the best
possible intentions, but liable to get him-
self sniggered at by reason of an utter lack
of humor. Yet there is one joke to his
credit. When he had produced “The De-
velopment of Australian Literature,” in con-
junction with the late Alex. Sutherland, a
kindly but not very valuable book of criti-
cism and biography, he was reproached by a
stranger who happened to be seated next him
at a banquet for having wholly overlooked
this person’s contributions to the literature of
our country. “I am very sorry, but I never
heard of you,” pleaded Turner; “what have
you done?” “What have I done! Why, I
am the winner of the Cole essay on ’ the
advantages of apples as a diet, and two
other essay competitions.” “Ah. I see, I
see how it is,” said Turner; “you need
a book to yourself.”
Martin Donohoe, the war correspondent,
who dropped the pen for the sword towards
the close of the war. always had a weakness
for soldiering. A little more than 20 years
ago, when he was
police roundsman on
Sydney Evening
News, Donohoe was
a trooper in the Syd-
ney Lauce-ahs; and
as he couldn’t keep a
nag on his screw he
used to hire a hack
from a livery stable,
lie was not then a
good horseman, but
he .seized every op-
portunity to practise,
and on several occa-
sions his investiga-
tions, which usually
had their end in the
arrest of criminals,
were done on horse-
back. (One of the
most important of
these was the Gat-
ton (Q.) tragedy. It
was the Lance-ahs
that made him a war-
correspondent, for
had he not been on a
trip to London in
uniform when the
Boer War broke out
the chances are that
the world would not
have heard of him.

HARVEST SONG.
[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
I cross<; I the fields of Maryvale, whose August garb
was rarest green.
The spring was shy, the sun was pale, the fragrant
breath of morn was keen.
On aimless quest I wandered west by tank and
stream, by hill and dale,
Till summer called me back to see the harvest fields
of Maryvale.
And I, who through the long night lay asleep beside
a river bend,
Awake to see the break of day, arise to watch the
sun ascend.
The skyline gleams, the sunlight streams, th'e mists
depart and shadows fail,
And breezes fan the spiral smoke above the hearths
of Maryvale.
I watch a binder as it cleaves a track through
pastures tall and dense;
1 see it throw the heavy sheaves against' a netted
bound’ry fence.
That magic sheen of living green I witnessed when
the spring was hale
No longer garbs the river flats and gentle slopes of
Maryvale.
The flats are flushed with bronze and gold, and
edged around with tossing trees;
And far afield the slopes unfold their carpets and
their draperies.
The crops stand nodding in the sun, whose radiance
stirs, whose beams assail,
The firm brown hands that hold the reins and drive
the teams of Maryvale.
What time the sable darkness steals and deepens
’neath a kindling sky,
I hear the rumbling waggon wheels, the falling hoofs
that homeward ply.
And every light that gems the night, or in the dis-
tance glimmers pale,
Calls home the toiler to his rest across the fields
of Maryvale.

ORIGINAL
BALATA
sd
BRITISH
BELTING
The Plant-owner who buys DICK’S Original Balata
Belting on the strength of what he has heard of it, is
naturally lead to expect a great deal from his plant.
And haven’t you invariably found that users of DICK’S Balata
Belting express unusual satisfaction with the way it lives up to
its high Character! The reason DICK’S has this .splendid endorse-
ment is that engineers actually do find it exceeds their expectations
in power and performance, economy, and capacity for hard, con-
sistent service.
Why be satisfied with a belt that is merely “good enough”? The
price of DICK’S Barata Belting is not higher, but it is years cheaper
m service. It speeds up production by transmitting the greatest
degree of power it lowers operating costs by rendering depend-
able and trouble-free service year in and year out—it conserves
the life of machinery, as it has no seams or splices fo bump, wear
or break the machines upon which it is operating.
DICK S is invariably the right belt in the right place on any or
every drive.

Nothing upsets the Happy
Spirit of the Picnic Party
so much as hitches in the catering. And here’s a
wise suggestion to all who are on “picnic bent.”
Slip a couple of tins of—
REX HAM PATE or
REX VEAL & TONGUE PATE
and a half loaf of bread into the hamper. Then if the other
supplies “run out” you can save the situation easily.
But the best course to pursue is to take plenty of
sandwiches with you, and with the twin Rex Pates as “a
filling” that’s an easy problem.
Rex Pates are all pure meat with the most delectable
flavor imaginable. Packed in hygienic tins, free from
solder flux. Sold everywhere.

The disclosed net profit from the year’s trad-
ing ni mortgages, etc., is given as £29,440;
but .^ n addition the management bagged
xoo6J over and above the book values of
properties unloaded or finally settled for
during the year. Twelve months ago the
‘properties in possession” item stood at
and in addition to the co.’s own
freehold premises, there was another Collins-
street property shown at the written-down
value of £40,000. This asset has been dis-
posed of, and all but £lOO of the book value
of-other foreclosures has disappeared. As
a result of this unloading considerable
changes have taken place in the balance-
sheet figures:—■

Almost £78,000 more is now out on mort-
gage than 12 months ago. So the whole of
the past year’s repayments of principal, the
proceeds from the sales of freehold proper-
ties and a large wad of the term’s profits
not required for divs. have been loaned to
clients. The total new business written is
not disclosed, but there are indications that
the management has put up a record eclips-
ing the performances of any other building
society, during recent years.
The Fourth Victoria has been plucky in
undertaking all this new loan business in
.such abnormal times, for it is business on
which few repayments have been made which
brings trouble if property values crash. But,
as the “Wild Cat” has said of this co. • on
many previous occasions, the Fourth Vic-
toria has always shown profound faith in
the future. It displayed that faith when,
some time after the ’nineties smash (which
it came through better than most others, but
still not without serious damage) it took
over some sick foundlings—the Lygon, Pre-
mier, South Melbourne, City of Prahran and
Planet societies. The process of absorbing
other cos. proceeded until recent years: in
1911 the Universal was brought" into the
fold, and in 1912 the Economic and the
Melbourne Permanent. Shareholders are
now being rewarded for their pluck: for
the first time they are receiving 10 p.c. divs.,
but the disclosed net profits from ordinary
business permitted as much again to go into
reserves. The co. could have paid better
divs. than S p.c. years ago, but reserves have
been, built up in a commendable way:
in fact, it looks as though actuary E.
J. Stock, who is a director of the
co., has been guiding the accumulation of
reserves for the protection of capital in the
same way he would insist on piling up assur-
ance. funds in a life office. Permanent capi-
tal is now £115,070 and investing capital
£31,561. After payment of latest divs.
reserves totalled £139,511. At Oct. 31 the
Fourth Victoria was working on £421.739 of
deposits, and, except for the £20,000 mort-
gage on its own headquarters, owed only
£232 besides. To protect the £421,739 of
deposits there were net assets with a book
value of £717,940—-almost 345. 9d. for each
£ of liabilities.

Shareholders and employees are having turn
about: in the distribution of profits. Twelve
months ago the former got a Is. bonus in
addition to the customary 10 p.c. div.; at
the April balance the. staff was given a 10
p.c. bonus on salaries (but whether that
merely brought wages to a reasonable level
or was something over and above a decent
wage is not made clear) ; now shareholders’
turn has come again, and another Is. bonus
is passed out to them. Ten years ago the
book value oj:' estates under administration
was £1,594,150; during the next five years
the figures had grown to £1,710,732;
at the latest balance they were £2,872,956.
No doubt abnormal conditions, by appre-
ciating values, have aided the recent
rapid growth ; and because of improved in-
terest earnings more grist is coming to the
co.’s mill from the larger figures. Commis-
sions, etc., brought in £9530 for the past half
compared with £4915 for the October term
of 1910 and £4990 for 1915. Capital has
moved from £lO,OOO to £lB,OOO over the 10
years, but the whole of the increase has
been provided out of profits; at least, Is.
bonuses have been paid in addition to the
usual divs. and immediately called up. The
directors now propose to issue 5000 new
shares for cash to erect new premises, a site
on St. George’s-terrace having been recently
acquired for £6157. If this new issue is
called up to the 18s. paid on existing
shares another £4500 will be put into the
business. At the latest balance paid capital
was £lB,OOO. and this and the reserves of
£21,207, together with the £32,000 of un-
called capital, represented the protection
which the co. afforded its clients in the event
of anything serious happening to the trusts
as a result of carelessness or worse. Assets

Pulp and Paper Products, Ltd., in 50,000
share of £1 each, is being formed to manu-
facture paper from Queensland pine waste
and other refuse. The Queensland Pine
Co. installed a plant at Yarraman, but
the venture crashed for lack of water,
and that co. now proposes to confine
itself to saw-milling. The pulping plant
cost approximately £21,000 erected, and Paul
.T. Ure, who has an option over it for
£&000, invites the public to put up
£30,000 and himself takes 5000 fully-paids
for introducing what he declares to be a
good thing. After acquiring plant and re-
moving it to a Brisbane freehold, putting
in a railway siding and providing additional
plant, he reckons on having £9OOO left for
working capital. The plant is said to have
a capacity of over 2000 tons kraft pulp p.a
and costs are figured at under £2l per ton.
The product is in the present abnormal
market worth about £5O per ton, but for
his estimate of prospective profits Ure bases
his figures on pulp fetching only £3O, which
he would bring in a profit of over
£20,000 p.a. He claims that available sup-
plies are “more than ample for several
plants.”

Grt. Boulder (W.A.) will soon be raising
ore from its O.K. mine, Norseman, and rail-
ing it to its Golden Mile mill. The O.K
reef is small but of good value, 4500 tons
treated by the prospectors having yielded "an
average of over 24dwt. Wlmt with steadily
decreasing ore "reserves in the main workings
and nothing of account being found outside
of them, the position at the Boulder mine is
not flourishing, and the help of a few more
O.K.’s is badly needed to keep the mill going.

Efforts to float the Wiluna group (W.A )
in Paris for a million sterling failed, but
a European co. has been induced to send
a man out to have a look at the mines.
Wiluna produced nearly £250,000 of gold,
but all this and a lot more went in wages,'
plant and development. Shareholders got
nothing,. and two or three cos. went to the
wall owing to high costs and poor extrac-
tions. The field has big lodes and may some
day turn out all right, but there are treat-
ment difficulties.

' O.B.”: “He Carteret’s” information
alleged Westralian oil finds is wrong.
The “located and identified petroleum” near
Bun bury was vegetable substance; another
find, “checked and corroborated by an
expert” at Pingelly, was merely the con-
tents of a tin of kerosene which some-
one had either deliberately or accidentally,
poured down a well. Still another, which
a picturesque writer said was “lapped by
the waves of the Southern Ocean, amid
elysian surroundings,’’ turned out to be a
few scattered lumps of petroleum washed
overboard from a passing ship. A fourth
proved a plain hoax. If “He Carteret” or
anyone else has found certain evidence of
petroleum in the West let him come forth
and produce it. The only person in West-
ralia who is “positive” that petroleum exists
there is a cheerful optimist named J. J. East,
but I don’t think he has ever been on an
established oil-field.
Block 10, Torrington (N.S.W.), has put
up a new Australian record: since March
IS tons metallic bismuth have been won.
When Block 10 was floated into a large co.
the smaller and richer deposit was abandoned
for Fielder’s Hill, an extensive but low-grade
area. But values proved too poor and share-
holders did no good. When John Hudson
took over the show on tribute he went back
to the old ground, and driving north hit upon
the large body of native bismuth which has
given the record returns.

Occidental Consolidated, Cobar, is getting
along fairly well with the remodelling of its
plant, and a large quantity of second-hand
machinery, etc., has been installed. The co.
expects to be producing within two or three
months, and if the flowery prospectus anti-
cipations are not realised it won’t be on
account of a shortage of staff or frill.
“Mainshaft”: A recent forecast that the
Bowen State coal-mine will supply Chillagoe
with coke will not be realised. It is a ques-
tion of distance and handling. Mt. Mulligan
supplies coke to Chillagoe and coal to the
railways and to Cairns, and Bowen can’t
beat it. Situated about equidistant between
Cairns and Chillagoe, Mulligan touches its
immediate terminals of demand in about 70
miles, and hauls its coal direct from pit to
railway waggon. Bowen would have one
handling to the port, another into the ship,
another at, Cairns wharf to rail. On the
other hand, without the rail connection of
Forsayth through the Percy to the Great
Northern rail system at Ilughenden or
Richmond, Mulligan cannot supply coke for
Cloncurry furnaces, and Bowen could handle
that trade. But the other rail connection
must come, and the shorter mileage will then
be all in favor of Mulligan.
The South Ails. Government has finally
declined the offer of the Dalmayne (Tas.)
coal-mine, the product being tested severely
and then pronounced not suitable to use-
alone —for railway purposes, the main require-
ment. There are mines to be bought at
a price in N. S. Wales, but S.A. is begin-
ning to think that getting the coal to Port
Adelaide when bought is likely to be as much
of a gamble as the buying of it.

Loftus Hills, the Speck’s Government

wasted.

“Millers” grip the road
—and hold it!
The tread of the “MILLER” tyre is “geared-to-the-
road.” Its cog-like feet mesh with road depressions
and minimise shock. As the tyre revolves every cog
momentarily takes a caterpillar grip, engaging the
surface with bulldog tenacity. This prevents slippage
and saves power. The tyre grips and holds the road!
“Miller” Tyres are hand-built by veterans. Every
tyre is signed inside by the man who makes it. Thus
every workman assumes personal responsibility for
the quality of his output.
Every “Miller” Tyre wears alike, because all are
BUILT alike! Uniform quality means uniform mileage!
Mr. C. M. Deane, of Sydney, used a pair of “Millers” over 8036 MILES!
Fit “Millers”—for REAL ECONOMY. Test them—see what they save!

Fairy Tales
Zora Cross (R.P. 25/11/’2O) has put
her finger straight on the cause of the trouble
with Hans Andersen’s stories for young
children —“so many of them are sad.” Now,
most youngsters like tragedy when it is big
enough to be impersonal. They thrill over
fantastic horrors, plenty of “blug,” battle,
stratagem, and righteous punishment of the
wicked. But sadness, sadness that touches
home to their own lives, is rather terrifying
to those innocents who demand a happy
ending as the inevitable last sentence. Yet,
perhaps, they are fortunate children who are
so harrowed by fairy tales. It is at least
the gentlest way to begin the lesson of tears
that all have to learn in the bitter end.
Even of the two favorites, “The Eleven
Wild Swans” is a. mournful, twilight kind of
story, though it finishes satisfactorily; and
the pathos of “The Little Sea Maid” almost
outweighs the charms of the under-sea won-
ders detailed in that most exquisite of poem-
stories.
From the Grimm Brothers. Perrault,
Edouard de Laboulaye-—oh memories of
Fragolette, of Yvonne, of Perlino, hero made
of pounded jewels and loved to life by a
princess!—down to Scott-Gatty and Howard
Pyle, there is a varied wealth all with the
old true glamor which children’s unerring
instinct accepts as constituting "fairy-tales,”
though more than half have not so much as
a flicker of gauze-wing in them. These are
the stories that should be told or read aloud
by a fire, folk-wise. Lucky little listener for
whom it was a camp-fire under the stars!
But, Zora Cross says, “I was seven”....
And after the tremendous stepping-stone of
seven, one rushes headlong towards double
figures, with swift mental growth. In those
years Andersen comes into his own. Not
for him the firelit circle and the older,
“tribal” voice declaiming. He speaks inti-
mately to the awakening individuality of Ten-
Years-Old. and there should be no third per-
son to endanger the spell. Like “Sintram,”
like “Water Babies” and one or two others,
the tenderest Andersen tales such as “The
Snow Queen” demand to be read in some
green solitude, preferably up a tree. For
one reader it was a blackwood tree, left for
shade in the big cow-paddock; and to this
day the hot smell of the bark and the hot
clank of cow-bells in a January sun-blaze
are inextricably mixed up with Lapland
snows and the strange Northern Lights
beneath which little Gerda sought her stolen
playmate.
Andersen the beloved, “the darling of the
children” in his own lifetime, is too sad and
too subtle for very young humans. The
humor of “The Happy Family” is lost on
them ; and the stark genius of such a master-
piece as “Anne Lisbeth” leaves them merely
vaguely troubled. But he is the last and
greatest of that procession of guides of whom
the first is dear old Mother Goose. Step by
step the child has travelled through the
simple adventure-narratives; and now Ander-
sen takes his hand and leads him a little
way along the lonely, wistful bypath of
Beauty. After that he is left to choose.
He may break back to the commonplace, or
follow up the Quest for himself.

(our acquaintance beginning in 188(3 or ’B7)
was a whimsical man, with boyish turns of
mind, but never exuberant, lie rejoiced in
practical jokes of a harmless kind, and had
always one to tell of. One concerned poor
Goodge, killed not long after. It was late
on a wet and boisterous night, and Daley
was disturbed in his sleep by a faint but
persistent knocking at his front door. He
slept on it twice, assuming, as he explained,
that it was a belated gasman or a rent-col-
lector walking in Lis sleep, before deciding
to go down. Goodge was leaning on the
door-jamb. He was affected by what
he had taken, but had been known to be
worse. “ ’Sail ri\ Jack,” he said, peer-
ing up through the miniature waterfall pour-
ing off the rim of his hat. “I wanna cup
of tea.” It was 2 o’clock in the morning,
and Goodge’s home was in Coburg, three
miles off. The poet took him in, led him
to the kitchen, pointed out things, and left
him to prepare a cup of tea and a meal for
himself. But after about half an hour, being
anxious concerning the guest, Victor arose
and entered the kitchen. Goodge had set
the kettle on the gas-stove, and turned all
the gas taps full on. Later he had made
himself a cup of tea with cold water poured
on a handful of cloves. He was seated at
the table, with a cup of this tea in his hand,
and a plateful of resin iire-kindlers before
him. One square of buttered kindlers he
was nibbling patiently. Looking up as his
host entered, he brandished the kindler, and
said gravely: “They’d be excellent if they
were fresh, ole f’l'r, I’m sure.” “I don’t
know what would have happened if the gas
co. hadn’t cut the supply off that morning,”
Daley explained.
But Melbourne was never quite con-
genial to Daley. Sydney, he said, had made
him what he was, “and when Sydney makes
you there is no other place on earth a man
is fit for. Sydney broke me in to lying on
warm beaches and curling my legs up in
the sun. There is no place nearer to Mel-
bourne than Beaumaris where a man can do
that with perfect satisfaction to his soul,
find poets cannot afford to go to Beaumaris.
If they could the weather would change
before "they got there.” Melbourne, he com-
plained, was mathematically correct, and for
that reason he disliked it. Sydney was cor-
rect from no point of view, for which reason
it was always perfectly delightful. Mel-
bourne he regarded as a literary purgatory
to which he had been sent for his manifold
wickednesses, and he looked longingly to
the day when time, if not repentance, should
have expiated his sins. Melbourne was too
systematic. No man could write anything
in Melbourne entirely satisfactory to the
Muses, who were permanently located in
Sydney. Some day a very rich man would
build a poets’ retreat within a threepenny
tram-ride of the Melbourne G.P.O. It
would be oil a piece of wooded beach, and
would have * long stretch of silver sand,
and artificial sunlight for heavy days. It
would have 11 hotels, because 11 hotels are
quite enough for any man. It would have
beautiful slopes overgrown with gums, and
wide, green lawns, too, and a replica of
Mosman reaching out into the bay, and a
bit of the Hawkesbury would be seen steal-
ing past perfumed wattles. Daley adored
the Hawkesbury.
Yet Daley had many friends in Mel-
bourne. Once even a Governor called upon
him, in his humble habitation —in Fitzroy,
I think it was. The story of the hens that
over-ran the place when his Excellency
stepped in has often been told, but Daley’s
own climax to the tale I do not remember
to have seen in print. “1 gave his Lord-
ship two of the fattest of the chickens,” said
Victor. Then, after a moment’s silence:
“I often wonder whose they were.”
I was living in South Melbourne, a rather
unsophisticated youth, when Victor first
called on me. He was carrying, it ap-
peared, the whole stock of a street coffee-
stall, minus the coffee. I say a street stall,
because it was much too late for any ordi-
nary respectable place of business to be
trading. His arms were full of fried fish,
his pockets were loaded down with meat-
pies. He was a very indignant man. He
explained that he had called, in answer to a
fond, fraternal impulse, on a brother littera-
teur dwelling in the locality, a staid, sober,
good man, with a well-ordered home and a
reputable profession, and he had been re-
buffed at the door. Indeed, after some little
talk the door had been shut in his face. “I
threw three pounds of fried fish through the
fanlight,” said Victor. “But why?” I de-,
manded. “My dear boy, merely to demon-
strate my capacity for returning good for
evil.”
Daley had extraordinary hands—long, slim
hands, with tapering fingers. I have known
two or three artists with similar hands,
notably Norman Lindsay. Daley fluttered
those hands continuously in conversation.
As he conversed he made a quaint pretence
of picking motes out of the atmosphere,
delicately, with peculiar grace. I used to
wonder in my simplicity if he was conscious
of the effect, but one day he confided to. my-
self and 1.. Bradley, the cartoonist: “I have
had a great honor done me. A man at the
top of his profession has offered to take me
in hand, and make rfte an even greater than
himself in six months’ time. He says I have
mistaken my call, and neglected God-given
gifts.” and Daley fluttered his long, pre-
hensile hand. “What was this great man?”
asked Bradley. “He is ‘Glue’ Callaway, the
celebrated pickpocket,” Daley replied. "He
says my hand is peculiarly adapted for slip-
ping seductively into other people’s pockets.”
Bradley grinned. I grinned. “Perhaps
you’re right,” said Daley.
I met Victor late one night in the crush-
room of the Alexandra Theatre. He was
in full evening dress, wearing a white carna-
tion in his button-hole, and smoking a fine
cigar of noble proportions. After refresh-
ments he explained his unaccustomed glory.
He had been to a political meeting earlier
in the evening, a meeting called in the inter-
ests of his friend the member, and, after
making his own speech, the politician had
induced Victor to go on and say something
that might redound to the credit of the M.P.,
election time being at hand. As Daley’s
suit was not equal to the occasion, they went
into a small room, and Victor was duly
equipped in the other’s dress-clothes. Victor
then delivered a playful little speech poking
fun at politicians in general and his friend
in particular. “Then,” said he, “I came
away.” “What.” I exclaimed, “in the other
fellow’s clothes! What will he do?” “Oh,
he is all right,” Victor replied, “he has
mine.” 1 had noticed Daley’s suit the day
before. Daley was not a proud man.
I have Daley’s photograph, the only one
of him I ever saw, taken for his book, “At
Dawn and Dusk.” On the back of this he
scribbled a verse of doggerel:—
I had intended to indite
Verses gay and recondite,
Each line dramatic, tender, terse,
.Tacky’s ideal half-crown verse,
Taking care the whole to cram
With iridescent epigram,
Verses to make you weep and laugh—
But, there, you have the photograph!
The “Jacky” alluded to was the editor of a
paper to which he supplied occasional contri-
butions, of whom Daley once alleged that
he had sent the wretched man several verses
from Proverbs, intended to convey a re-
proof for some recent editorial action. The
editor despatched these back with a note:
“Would have used the enclosed if it had
been rhymed. Kindly rhyme it and return.
We dislike blank verse.” And that editor
was a good churchman. He had been three
times convicted of being elder of the kirk,
Daley assured me.
Here is given only an exterior view of
Victor Daley, the surface he presented to the
world. Beneath was the serious man, the
writer of “Dreams” and the “Sunset Fan-
tasy,” beset by many tribulations; but that
real Daley was seen by few, and then only-
in rare glimpses.
EDWARD DYSON.
Conrad Martens
For three reasons the work of Conrad
Martens is interesting : firstly, for its histori-
cal value; secondly, because he was our first
artist; thirdly, for its art. Its art alone is
not sufficiently strong to make it permanently
interesting. Indeed, it needed Conrad Mar-
tens. the Man and his Art, by Lionel Lind-
say (Angus and Robertson, Sydney), to re-
mind many of us that there ever was such a
one.
Landing in Sydney in 1835. at a time when
he could have found but scant appreciation
for the work that came from him at his
best, Martens had to satisfy the judgment of
his buyers. Most of his large pictures were
painted to sell, and it is in comparatively few
of his works that we are able to get a clear
view of the man. Free from the worry of
making a living, the painter of “Sydney
Cove,” ‘‘Sydney from St. Leonards” and the
so-called "Romantic landscapes' could not
have produced "Sydney Heads,” “Jamieson
Valley,” “Elizabeth Farm” or "Crown Ridge”
and many others. We see him at his best
(though, at his best, a slave to the fashion
of his day—brown trees) in “Sydney from
St. Leonards,” struggling to paint light. In
the other things he gives us mere descriptions
of places, witn but little art beyond a fairly
well painted sky—probably the one portion of
the picture in which he could indulge his
outlook without spoiling a sale. He was
certainly a slave to his buyer when he painted
the ugly “Crown Ridge.” Bad in tone and
color, and small in every way, with (for in-
cident) a blacks’ camp perched on a seem-
ingly ungetatable prominence, this picture
would be rejected from almost any modern
local exhibition; and so would “Papeete
Harbor.” “Sydney Cove” is, I think, the
best picture he has left us. He appears to
have made it a study of light, and apart
from an obviously invented shadow in the
foreground, and a rather heavy tone in the
middle distance (but that may be a fault
of the reproduction), he has largely suc-
ceeded in the illusion, and though he has
indulged in topography the result remains
art, because he has studied more carefully
the tonal relations of the little incidents. He
developed considerably in this country,
reached his highest level about 10 years after
his arrival and fell oil’ again. In “Papeete
Harbor,” “Barcoo Creek,” and “Bridge
Street,” all of 1835 —the year he landed —
we find him depending on formulae and pro-
ducing but poor stuff. In 1841-2 he was
giving us his best in "Sydney from St.
Leonards” and "Sydney Cove.” _ln his next
dated picture, “Brisbane in 1852,” having
apparently given way to the whims of his
buyers, be has gone off considerably. In
1804 (“Sydney from Vaucluse”) and 1800
(“Sydney Harbor from Point Piper”) he
attempts to come back, but the years of
painting deliberate untruths have left their
ma rk.
Had Martens been free to develop he would
have set up here a standard of art that might
not have been so easily surpassed by our later
men. This can be said of him that, although
never entirely free from the dictates of the
art fashions of his day and of his buyers, he
did whenever possible humble himself before
Nature. And though he did leave us much
that is false because he was not free, was
he for that a greater sinner than many of
our present-day painters who, though they
have a buying public which gives them
absolute freedom, insist on a parade of
technique and dramatic and pretty fancies no
less false in lighting than any of Martens’s
works ?
Lionel Lindsay gives us much that is
interesting of his subject’s life and art. He.
has taken great pains to make his contri-
bution complete, and he has succeeded ; but
his praise is at times extravagant, as in his
remarks on the slight thing called “Moon-
light” and the pencil studies, which have
no more merit than you can find in the work
of many of the better students of the pre-
sent day. . . . ,
Beautifully produced, containing bO colored
and other plates, this book makes a valuable
addition to the library of the connoisseur.
LEASON.
A Satchel of Books
Le Petit Nord, by Anne Grenfell and
Katie Spalding (Houghton, Mifflin Co., Bos-
ton). Letters descriptive of the ladies life
in Labrador. Verv interesting, no doubt,
to their friends.
The Little Ragged Blossom, by May
Gibbs (Angus and Robertson). A continua-
tion of the adventures of Snugglepot and
Cuddlepie, daintily illustrated and whimsi-
cally told. .Capital gift-book for the small
Australian girl.
Men and Thought in Modern History, by
Ernest Scott (Macmillan). Short but
scholarly essays on 24 representative thinkers
and men of action, from Rousseau to H. G.
Wells. The Professor is an admirable
biographer, as his Life of Flinders showed,
and he has the gift of exposition in a high
degree; by skilfully blending the biographic
and the expository he has produced an enter-
taining and instructive book. The sketches
of Napoleon, Metternich and William Morris
are particularly well done.
The Shanty keeper'8 Daughter, by Vance
Palmer (N.S.W. Bookstall Co.). The story
of a feud, which, developing from a trifling
row, involves a large section of Western
Queensland in a fever of hatred, bitterness
and language. Squatter Cunningham is the
dominating feudist, and the manner in which
he is brought to look upon his neighbors
with a more friendly eye is one of the best
episodes in the yarn. The author has intro-
duced a large quantity of horseflesh, and
there is a hoofbeat in almost every para-
graph. A good open-air tale told in an
honest open-air style.
The Inky Way
Of a great European artist: —
Anders Zorn, the greatest modern in Swedish art,
whose death was lately reported, was as versatile as
our own Norman Lindsay; oils and water-colors,
etchings and sculpture were the equally beautiful
children of his plastic hand and colorful brain. Com
ing to Stockholm at 15, determined to be an artist,
he was first a water-color man because oils were so
much dearer. But soon Paris laid its seal upon his art,
and he won fame and comparative fortune when still
quite young. There are some of his etchings in the
Sydney National Gallery, and many of his works are
in American collections. He had a great vogue in the
U.S.A. as a portrait paint*. Born in Mora, in one
of the oldest provinces in the middle of Sweden, where
the' men and women still wear the national costume
and have the old-time dances and sports, when success
came to him he went hack to live among his own
people, loving their traditions, and the simplicity of
their ways; and at his funeral his coffin was drawn
to the grave by four black horses caparisoned with
spreading branches of red leaves.

“Tropic Bird”: The bird which “1241”
(B. 18/11/’2O) libels by. calling a “hawk” is the
Australian wedge-tailed eagle, the largest member
of the family to be found in any part of the world.
The wing-spread stated (9ft. lOin.) is, however,
considerably past anything I have come across,
and I have 3een a good many, all of them under
Bft. This noble bird is ruthlessly destroyed because
it is said to kill young lambs. But Dr. Leech, a
very great authority, declares that he has not yet
met any man who was prepared to state on oath
that he had seen an eagle carrying off a young
lamb. Most of our birds when seasons are lean
and regular food scarce make wide departures from
their true diet. I remember one drought year when
the little silver-eyes, finding their ordinary food
scarce, took to fossicking in the garbage-bins; and
once up north, during a very dry spell, I wit-
nessed a sunbird —the beautiful little jewel of
green and yellow, usually associated with flowers
and nectar—battling with a large spider which he
was banging against a limb. Probably under similar
conditions of food-scarcity eagles have taken a few
lambs, but under normal conditions their diet con-
sists of smaller marsupials, rats, birds, etc.
“Cleveland L.”: “R.E.8.” (B. 25/11/’2O)
has had better luck than I in dodging ants by
merely climbing up into carts. Once I left a tin of
honey in my State carriage for a few days while
searching for Dobbin, who had strayed, and on
returning found that a force of the enemy had
launched a vigorous attack. The route was via
the prop and along the shaft. Maybe the axle-
grease barred the wheel as a path.

“Zantlius”: Some Victorian fishermen have
a curious way of getting squid bait good and ready
for action. They cut off a piece about the size of a
half-crown and chew on it for a while. It is alleged
that this renders it tough and elastic and makes it
stick to the hook better. As to taste, it’s said to be
much the same as chewing rubber. Squid makes good
“oyster” soup, anyway, as Theophilus Phriedphish
could testify.

“T.8.D.”: Those who were aboard an
Australian warship that lately visited Rabaul saw
some birds choose a strange nesting-
place. We had hardly got our lines
ashore before several house-hunting
couples arrived, and they put the
spotting tops, masts, yards, ■ etc.,
through a very thorough overhaul be-
fore deciding on furnishing a couple
of flats in the control top on the fore-
mast. We remained at Rabaul a
week, during which time the custo-
mary drills were suspended. The
morning we left I noticed one of the
nautically-inclined fowls struggling
with about half a fathom of spun
yarn: it had fouled the starboard
shroud just outside his doorstep and
brought him up all standing. Fail-
ing to clear it, he piped all hands on
deck, and his mate (who had evi-
dently been having a watch below)
turned out and lent a beak to clear
away the cordage. They got it clear
and promptly coiled it down around
the inside of their nest. By the time,
that was done to their satisfaction
and they had come out to invite Mrs.
Next-door in t*o inspect their new
furniture, they woke up to the fact
that this blanky new cocoanut-tree
was behaving in an unsteady and
suspicious manner; and as there was
dense black smoke vomiting from four
dangerous-looking craters just be-
neath, they* left hurriedly to spread
the news of another volcanic eruption.
I went aloft and found two almost-
completed nests mixed up with the
gunnery-director gear, and next day
an unfeeling gunnery-officer served an
ejectment notice on them. On our
return, about a week later, the birds
came aboard to resume lodgings, and the language
they used, on failing to discover their homes, would
have shocked a roadside sparrow. The birds, by the
way, are a little larger than a sparrow, have a long
beak and body, and would make a crow look white.
“1241”: My experience runs with that of
“R.E.8.” (B. 25/11/’2O), who found that ants don’t
trouble a man who is.perched in his caravan. I have
watched them crawl up the spokes of the wheel, but
they always baulk at the nave; they turn around and
crawl back slowly to earth. When tanksinking out
west the little black ants proved my worst enemy, but
the old dog and I were always able to snatch rest in
the old spring-cart.

“Murkah”: One man, one reaper and
binder: two horse-teams, spell about—69f acres in
2i days. Toss Field did it at George Bassett’s farm,
near Forbes (N.S.W.). Bassett paid Field 6s. an
acre for it. I nominate the performance as a
record. Admittedly the days were magpie to mopoke.
But that doesn’t matter; tljey’re the only kind the
binder knows.
“Mbonie”: Here’s a case to match
“Mulga’s” (B. 18/11/’2O) statement about the bush-
man’s ability to identify individual cattle in a mob.
On Boatman (S.Q.), where the sheep were numbered
by tens of thousands, the manager, a noted stud-
master, deputed the overseer to class the stud ewes,
arranging to go over the work when it was finished.
THE GENTLE HINT.
“When you’ve finished ringin’ that tree, just knock the suckers off, will yer?”
“Suckers! There ain’t none on it, boss.”
“But there will he by the time you’ve finished.”
The overseer had difficulty in deciding the fate of
a particularly fine animal, good in all points, but
with a coarse, “staggy” head. He at last, after
careful consideration, retained her in the stud. The
manager, when his turn came, pointed out that, in
breeding studs, the head, which denotes character,
is of the first importance, and consequently he put
the lady out to run bush with the flock. A month
later the police arrested a man on a charge of steal-
ing 300 sheep, the property of Boatman. During
the trial, held at Roma, the defence, that the dis-
puted sheep were part of a draft sold a year since,
seemed to be carrying the day. The manager’s
statement that both he and his overseer were pre-
pared to identify one animal among the 300 in the
yard, it being a ewe cast from the stud a month
previously, brought incredulous smiles to the faces
of the jury. With the Judge they filed out to the
courtyard to see these two do it. The manager,
after a short search, picked out one he knew, which
was then secretly marked and put back into the
flock. The overseer was then called, and, without
any hesitation, went straight to the one secretly
marked, it being his old friend the lady with the
staggy head. Boatman got the sheep, and the
prisoner got three years’ hard.

“The Pariah”: “South Coast’s” recent
abo.-wail about the destruction of trout by cormo-
rant or shag leaves me cold. I cannot forget that
the imported but edibly-untempting fish wiped out
from many Victorian rivers the succulent blaclyfish. I
know the. pleasures of the trout-rod, but a white grub
on a strong bit of string provided me with many a
tas.ty meal. The arrival of the foreign sporting
fish was the signal for the extinction of a good and
useful Australian.
W # * *
“Two Seas”: Sheep have more intelli-
gence than they get credit for among those who have
never studied them except as mutton. There is a
blind ewe in our flock, and his particular chum is
an old wether who is always to be found near her.
When the mob was being driven lo another paddock
the other day the blind ewe missed the gate and
poked along on the wrong side of the fence, bleating
for her mate. The old wether, hearing her signals, left
the mob and ran back into the paddock, ranged
alongside the ewe and steered her through the gate
to the rest of the flock. At the next gate he got in
front of her and piloted her safely through. Unlike
the traitor at the slaughter-yards who leads his tribe
to destruction, our old guide gets no tobacco for his
job.

“Billy T.”: Talking about horse sense.
One day a drover rode up to the front of Brazenor’s
hotel, facing the Ballarat cattleyards, at Alfredton,
and after tying his horse to the bar over the trough
went indoors. A few minutes later a Ballarat butcher
arrived, leading a big bay, and tied his nags to the
fence. The drover’s neddy and the led horse seemed
to betray unusual interest in each other. Soon the
former horse unhitched himself with his teeth, then
deliberately untied the halter rope tethering the
bay, and the two cantered away together down the
Haddon-road. They were discovered two days
later, feeding in a paddock seven miles off. It then
came to light that up to 12 months previously and
over a space of three years the two horses had
worked as a pair in the pole of a hawker’s waggon.
They were celebrating the reunion.
“Barcoo”: “Zanthus” (B. 11/11/’2O)
refers to a droving trip of 2000 miles overland with
cattle; but it was Dave Coleman who established the
long-distance record with a mob of sheep. Starting
from Clermont, Peak Downs (Q.), with a grazing
farmer’s mob of 5000 ewes at the beginning of the Big
Drought in 1900, his job was to look for grass. He
travelled over practically the whole of Central and
Nor’-West Bananaland, holding on to his flock for 61
years. They never returned to their original pasture,
spear-grass having arrived on the holding. When
eventually disposed of none of the mothers of the flock
that went out into the wilderness in the first instance
were alive. The drover kept moving about to places
where the grasses were greenest, spelling on agistment
for months at a time, now for shearing and now for
lambing. The outfit bred all its own mutton during
the 61 years, and when the disposal of the Israelites
took place the man in charge delivered 3800 more
jumbucks than he started with, besides selling 5000
in the interim. The which at one time
numbered up to 9000, more than paid the cost of
droving. The drover estimated that he covered 5000-
odd miles during the pilgrimage.

“Gagi”: “Ewa” forgot to mention that
Binghi skins his shark- before cooking it (B.
25/11/’2O). Shark, mackerel, mullet and barra-
couta are all rendered rank and unpalatable by oil
contained in tiny cells between the skin and the

months for drunk and disorderly! If
that ain’t profiteering I dunno what is.”
flesh. Scaling merely drives this in, and spoils the
white, fleshy meat. Skinning removes the oil and
leaves the flesh as white and as good as that of
flathead. Whether it is shark or any of the other
fish mentioned above, give me Binghi for chef every
time.

THE HOT MEMBER.
[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
Upon my little farm at Yam two noble roosters were,
Beau Brummel and Beau Nash, a game, extremely
gaudy pair. •
Than Brummel never rooster was so splenetic and
rash,
Unless it was that other most pugnacious rascal,
Nash. ,
They fought about the tucker, and they quarrelled
o’er the hens ;
They fought for right of precedence when going
to the pens;
They battled with grim vigor if one crowed; they
raised a fuss
As brutal if one’s silence seemed a trifle ominous.
It rained —Nash set on Brummel, and accused him
foully then
Of bedraggling all the costume of his favorite little
hen.
If hot the day, Beau Brummel smote the other hip
and thigh,
Declaring him responsible that all the troughs were
dry.
To put an end to bloodshed and have peace betweer
the pair,
We cut the throat of Brummel, and we plucked the
carcase bare.
We boiled him, and we set him on the window-sill
to cool—
We eat our chicken cold with lettuce salad, as a rule.
Then arose out in the farmyard such a terrible to-do.
t went investigating. Hens had formed a ring for
two,
And within it Nash was going hurricane of
fluff
For Brummel’s bones. I never saw Beau Nash in
such a huff.
FOREWARNED.
O LDUN: “Hullo, Jim, goin’ ter meet yer girl?
What do yer want a light for —I alius
met mine in the dark.”
YOUNGUN: “My oath! An’ see what you
got.”
He peeked the poor boiled body, and he smote it
with his feet.
He tore away great fragments, and protested at the
heat.
And if he got his claws in he would let go like a
shot- .
'Though Brummel was a dead bird he had never been
so hot.
If he sent poor Brummel spinning, as he very often
would,
The grave old hens applauded, saying: “Good! Oh,
very good !.”
Nash won the fearful battle, knocked his foe all in
a heap,
Then stole beneath the storeroom floor in medita-
tion deep.
The fur was scalded off his neck,_his feet were just
a fright;
He had internal burns through bits he'd swallowed
in the fight.
An awful week he spent, since when he’s ne’er been
known to smile.
Now show a chicken boiled, and Nash will up and
run a mile!
VICTORIA.

“Koel”: The most striking example of
Scotch forethought I’ve ever met was at the Dee rush,
Rockhampton way. When going home one evening
I came across Donald McQueen, a well-known old
Queensland mining identity, filling in shallow holes
along the track to his camp —he had already covered
in the deep ones with logs. “Losli,” he explained,
“but are you no remembering that Chreesmis is varra
close? It would be a peetiful thing for an auld mon
like ma-sel’ to fa’ doon yin o’ these. It’s no ma’sel’
Ah’m theenking of, but Ah inaicht breek the bottle.”

“Mrs. Lance Rawson”: In the early days,
when men went to church with their families, the
custom was for the head of the house to whisper his
entrance prayer (while standing) into his hat. Once
after Johnny, our Queensland abo. bodyguard, had been
to church with us he came round to me next day to
say, “Missie Lance, what for ebry man smell-em
hat belonga him? Mine can’t find somet’ing no
good smell longa hat belonga master?” Johnny
had been investigating meantime.
* * * *
“E.L.C.” : Let me butt in on this snake-
swallowing-snake argument. Some years ago a cer-
tain doctor in Sydney kept two tiger-snakes for
experimental purposes. They were housed together
in a small cage. One day war was declared, with
the result that the larger of the two, a fine speci-
men 4ft. Gin. long, succeeded in swallowing the
other, a mere worm of 48 inches. The victor was
overcome with his success and died shortly after
his long meal. The two snakes were placed in
spirit and are still preserved. The body of the
larger snake has been slit at intervals of about a
foot to allow the other to be seen. There is only
about 11 inches of the meal left unswallowed.
* * * *
“Kororareka” : Some of the history-books
allege that the last case of cannibalism in Maoriland
occurred in 1842, when Taraia and his followers ate
long pork at Tauranga and justified the meal on the
ground that the materials for tt had helped to eat
Taraia’s mother years before. But the custom was
revived 27 years later when the Hau-haus were rais-
ing Cain. A deserting soldier who had joined the
Maoris described, years afterwards, how he had seen
the Hau-haus cut up, roast and eat a Tommy whose
bad luck it was to fall into their hands in the
Taranaki bush.
* * * *
“Cowell” : The trials of the chummy are
past belief. Two of them drove a horse and sulky
from Charleville with their swags, which comprised
numerous ports. It took them half a day to pack
up; then after travelling only a mile or two they
turned out on the dinner camp. But not in the
true bushman style; they simply tied the horse up
to a tree, leaving him in the shafts. Unfortunately
they put him on a meat-ants’ nest, and it wasn’t
long before the little devils went exploring. Natu-
rally the yarraman started to kick like the devil.
The chummies, being ignorant of the cause, said:
“We have bought a mad horse. He will clear out
and we will lose everything.” So one of them
grabbed the rifle and shot the horse to make a
cert, of their gear. One chap then guarded the
sulky whilst the other sorrowfully returned to
Charleville to buy another horse.
THE GHOST OF COBB AND CO.
“Ragar”: There’s nothing in that yarn
about wrapping the Sunday joint in pawpaw leaves
and making it tender. I was told to try the stunt
when I first went north and before I’d learnt the
truth about North Queensland beef, but never found
any amount of wrapping make the slightest differ-
ence. The pre-digesting theory may be all right as
far as the juice of the unripe fruit is concerned. It
may' even thaw off warts, as alleged. But it makes
no impression on N.Q. beef. One other thing I know
about the pawpaw is that it’s a mighty bad thing
to have growing in the vicinity of the bedroom win-
dow. There’s something thrown off in the heavy
fragrance of the flowers, from male and female trees
alike, which pre-digests anyone’s entire system. My
personal experience was gained on Darnley Island,
where there were pawpaw trees growing and flower-
ing all around the house. Before we’d been there
very long the whole lot of us—wife, kiddies and all
-—began to fade away, and it wasn’t till the M.O.
had seen us and made inquiries that the trouble
came out. Next day there wasn’t a pawpaw tree
within coo-ee of the house, and we started to mend
right away. Eaten, either ripe as a fruit or boiled
green as a vegetable, the pawpaw takes a lot of
beating. A selected out-size fruit, fully ripe, cut in
halves, and with the seeds removed, packed with
crushed ice, and kept in the ice-chest for awhile,
sounds promising; but with the ice tipped out and
replaced by a glass of good sherry and a sprinkle of
dust sugar—well, it’s a distf to win the favors of the
gods.
“Country Ped”: Don’t throw away all
the patent capsules off your beer bottles. A few of them
will make an excellent curry-comb. This way. Chit
out a piece of wood, oval-shape. The end of a
lcerosene-case is about the right thickness. Pull
the cork wafers oht of some capsules, then tack
them, inside out, round the board; likewise fill
up the middle, leaving a small space between each.
Fasten a strap over the back for your hand, and
go and groom your horse. I guarantee he’ll be
pleased,

“Murkali” : Until recently feeding a chaff-
cutter was one of the most dangerous of bush occu-
pations. Various so-called safeguards were devised,
but all were faulty in that they depended on being
brought into operation by the man in trouble.
Experience showed that men unfortunate enough to
be caught by the relentless steel rollers thought of
nothing but pulling back. A Victorian named Ellis
some time ago introduced an idea which not only
renders accident impossible but assists the feeder at
his work. Three dummy rollers extend back
about two feet from the deadly pair which, under a
pressure of considerably over a ton, tear the hay
through to the knives. The hay is fed to the first
dummy, and the feeder is done with it; the revolving
dummies, all of which are harmless, do the rest.
The thanks of all ehaffeutter workers are due to Ellis,
whose patent should be on all machines, to any of
which it can be fitted. During a recent Riverina
trip I saw a considerable number of cutters without
it.

“Barcoo”: Big shearing tallies in Queens-
land are things of the past owing to the curtail-
ment of the barbers’ working hours. Under the
old system they worked Bhr. 20min. on each of five
days, and 4hr. 40min. on Saturdays. The full days
were done in six runs —two hours before the 8-
o’clock breakfast, an hour for breakfast; two runs
of lhr. 20min. till noon, with 20min. in between
for smoke-o; an hour for mid-day meal; and three
more runs in the afternoon, broken by two spells,
one of 20min. for smoke-o and the other of 30min.
for 4-o’clock lunch. This meant 12fhr. for the
shed-hands, from the getting-up bell till they left
the . shed at night. Under the new State award
the warning signal goes three minutes before every
knock-off time, and after the signal no shearer is
allowed to bring a sheep out of his catching-pen.
This is a decent provision for the rouseabouts. Under
old conditions the shearers, though professed social-
ists to a man, made it the practice to “catch” just
on the bell; and generally it was the “snob” (s.e.,
the hardest-shearing sheep) which took more than
double the average time to shear, thus necessitating
all the rouseabouts putting in on an average 20
minutes each day over and above the original 48
hours per week. The runs now worked are four
of 2hr. for full days, and twq of 2hr. on Saturdays,
with the three-minute reservation before mentioned,
The new conditions will reduce the average shearer’s
daily total by between 20 and 30 sheep.
“McNorth”: I was running a trading
ketch about the inner .route of the New Guinea
Barrier, and one night, the wind being easy and the
sea smooth, I turned in early, leaving the native
crew to work the vessel. Some time in the early
hours of the morning I was awakened by the noise

showed that we were off the course. I rushed up
on deck. There was no one at the wheel and the
deck was deserted; but from the square of the open
hold amidships came a subdued wailing that was
suggestive of great fear. I put the vessel back on
her course and ran forward. Leaning over the coam-
ing of the hatch 1 ripped out a question, and pre-
sently, slowly, reluctantly, a fuzzy head appeared
up out of the darkness, a pair of big, round eyes
looked into mine, and one brown hand gripped my
pyjama-clad arm while another pointed tremblingly
to the cloudless eastern sky. At once I saw what it
was that had sent the crew flying below in supersti-
tious fear. Halley’s comet had made its first appear-
ance in those latitudes.

“Paul C.”: Old Skeldon read an article on
how hides were ruined by people branding their
calves too early and by using very big brands. He
read it impressively to his selector neighbors, and
they decided that the article was right, and that
they’d brand no more of their calves till they were
yearlings at least. Each one decided on a particu-
lar earmark, so that he would know his own cattle
when they were rounded up to be branded. When
the rest had selected an earmark to put on the
calves when voung, Skeldon announced that his ear-
mark would 'be both ears off. The others said that
would spoil the look of the calves. Skeldon said it
didn’t matter. . His idea, he explained, was that
dingoes always pull calves down by the ears, and
as dingoes were killing a lot in the neighborhood he’d
sacrifice the looks to save the carcase. The others
laughed at Skeldon. It was observed after 12
months that there must have been something in
Skeldon’s idea, after all, for when branding time
came he had considerably more calves than any of
his neighbors. As time'went on Skeldon’s herd of
earless animals appeared to be increasing in exact
proportion to'the joint losses of his neighbors. Then
old McDuff changed his earmark. He copied Skel-
don’s, but in order to distinguish between the two
he deprived his calves of a portion of the tail,
“Yon’ll mak’ ’em harder for th’ dingoes t’ grip.”
he said, pointing to a cropped calf. Soon Skeldon
and McDuff owned all the calves in the neighbor-
hood, according to their marks, only McDuff’s bob-
tailed bovines by far outnumbered Skeldon's earless
beasts. Then Skeldon announced that McDuff was “a
damned rogue,” and from that on everyone kept his
brands in the fire ready to pop on to a calf as soon
as it came into the world.
“Lakatoi”: Jones, Brown and Tomkins
lived together and ran a mess, for which Negosiri
was. official cook. Across the street beneath the palms
o( a Papuan village Robinson, Dash and Sleet
luxuriated in the atrocities perpetrated by their
cookie-boy, Erua. Two or three hundred yards up
the track Hennessy, McEwen and Dawes risked then
digestion bv employing Bogi-Tau to juggle with
their fQOd ' And acrQSS the wa g ks restrained
homicidal intentions towards Raka-Masi, his euli-
nary cross. The four households were on amicable
terms, and when one or other ran short of some-
thing in the tinned line he borrowed from the rest,
the loans being adjusted at the end of the month,
Brown Brother quickly discovered the possibilities
0 f this friendly arrangement, and enthusiastically
supported it. “Taubada [master], misi lonisi [Jones]
he like two-fellow tin mileek [milk],” warbled
Raka-Masi to Sparks, who was discussing the shock-
ing p a y of the civil servants of Papua and a long
whisky-and-soda with his cobber Rockford in the
eoo l of the evening. “Righto! Give him Tonga
boy.” And, as he remembered that a similar request
had been complied with the previous evening, he
added: ‘‘ Jo f s d <.\ bit h jf^“ mus 1 ‘ U l e ,°"

A fragrant load of tea-tree bloom,

Like droves of sheep before the sun.

Power in Yo
ANY country home, farm, station, Store, school,
church, hotel or garage can have its own
electric supply by installing Western Electric Power
and Light.
Practically every benefit which the up-to-date city
dwelling enjoys from electric current is provided by
the Western Electric Plant, and because of the many
duties which it performs, it easily pays for its cost
in a very short time.
You can have electric lights everywhere at the snap
of a switch, and in addition to that wonderful com-
fort, the Western Electric Plant supplies abundant
electric current which enables you to use an Electric
Fan,aWashing Machine, Electric Iron, Portable Elec-
tric Sewing Machine, Vacuum Cleaner or Toaster.
Easy tO Start. The Western Electric Plant is as easy to start
as a motor car fitted with a self-starter- You simple press a switch,
the current runs from battery to generator, which cranks the en-
gine and away it goes.
Automatic control. After the Western Electric Plant is
started you tan go away and forget it. It takes care of itself and
you can’t harm the battery. The Western Electric Battery
is given a tapering charge, full at first and then gradually
slowing down as the battery fills. Then the engine auto-
matically stops. Everything that is needed is provided
and the plant is so simple that a child can operate it.

Electric Light and
r Country Home ?
Big strong Battery. Another overwhelming Western Elec-
tric advantage is the greater Battery Capacity. This means more
lights, more power and freedom from annoyance. The Western
Electric Battery has a capacity of 288 Ampere Hours (S.A.E. Rating)
Compare this with other lighting plants and you will find that the
Western Electric outfit has nearly twice the capacity of others.
Western Electric Power and Light costs less to buy and less to
run when Battery Capacity and general equipment are considered.
Uses Kerosene and feeds itself. Western Electric
Power and Light runs on kerosene. Just a little petrol is needed
to start the plant and it switches over to cheaper fuel at once.
The Western Electric Plant is fitted with Pump Fuel Feed which
ensures a proper supply all the time.
Air-COoled and oils itself. A splendid system forces a
regular supply of cool air right throughout the plant and keeps
it in perfect condition. You simply pour oil into the crank case
and the engine does the rest. Oil is sprayed through the crank
case, into the cylinder In fact, whenever oil is needed, this plant
sees that it gets there.
For driving Machinery. A pulley is fitted to the y/* h.p
Engine so that you can use it for many farm jobs in the same
way as a separate engine.
Scores of the finest country homes in Australia are equipped with
Western Electric Power and Light and there are thousands in
use throughout the world. Over 50 years of electrical experience
stand behind its construction and guarantee its reliability.
Western Electric Power and Light is easy to buy, too. Write to

of any dimensions, and collective consignments
such as bars, pipes, scrap, etc.
We illustrate an “IGRANIC” Lifting Magnet of the
Large Capacity Single Unit Type. Note that this

because it enables one stock of units to be built up
or down to meet any requirement of the material to
be handled or the capacity of the crane.
“IGRANIC” Lifting Magnets are practically inde-
structible. Every unit is thoroughly water-tight,
and cannot be injured by weather or immersion.
No other magnet of equal weight or bulk will lift
so heavy a load as “Igranic” Large Capacity Single

Flanders in Peace.
[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
I KNOW that the sun shines there, but m
retrospect it seems that I have always
missed it, and found instead the hang-
ing fog or the rain of the Lowlands. Dis-
tances are short, and good, cheap inns aie
many, so a walk through Flanders in the
rain is not a penance; on the contrary, it
is the truest way to see the country or
was, when there was any of it to see. -Those
roads in the pictures—the white roads bor-
dered by the feathery-topped, skeleton trees
where the waggoner crouches sleepily from
the wet —are all true, as are the taverns and
the fat girls and the grey-and-blue beer-
mugs, the mountains of good food at any
hour of the misty, mediaeval day, Brussels,
of course, is gay and superficial: opera-
houses, painted ladies, a smell of Parisian
asphalt and cigarettes, banks, and no laith
in God —all very 20th century. But as the
wet roads go out into the provinces and
villages, as the mud creeps up your ankles,
the Middle Ages come bach to you travelling
the changeless roads they painted. The
brown inn-rooms are there at the wayside
as they were five centuries ago, the great
fires, the large, instructive bodily life which
is older than intellect and asphalt, better
and more solid than even banks. Here you
must try to make yourself understood in
Flemish; the French of Ghent and Brussels
is met with a stare of uncomprehending
scorn. By this the illusion is completed.
You know that to-day and the tiukliug skill
of its tongue are buried under the mud, the
earth and rain, of the strong dead yester-
days; that here only the rugged Vlaemisch
is any good to you. It and the long tradi-
tions, the children’s tales, the love of the
generations were all made here in the small
communities before the big ones wrote the
stories into books in the nuw Norman.
Long ago the nation’s memories were kept
well in Flanders. As the roads are un-
changed in 500 years, so the tongue is the
same for nearly 1200. So little has the
Flemish, form of Low German altered that
the creed drawn up by the Council of Lip-
tines in 124 (in which pagans expressed their
renunciation of idolatry on their conversion
to Christianity) needs only the change of
a dozen letters to make it intelligible to
a Fleming to-day. The 13th century public
deeds are made out in practically modern
Flemish. In that century Van Maerlant,
the father of Flemish poets, wrote “The
Historical Mirror,” and Van Utenhovtf
wrote much verse freely translated from the
French, the High German and the Latin.
All these ancient things are readable in the
originals to-day; their style would be the '
better for some editing, of course, but they
are readable. Farther back, in the middle
of the 12th century, Nivardus, a monk,
wrote “Reinardus,” which was really the
gathering together of the 11th century wolf-
epic of Flanders, and the writing-down of
the fables of Reynard the Fox, folklore for
at least 400 years. These tales have been
put into English, French, High German,
and all the languages, but “Ileinaert de
Vos” is the bedtime stories of 7th and 8th
and 20th century Flemish children.
In the. 14th century wahdering poets car-
ried stories and songs up and down the
Netherlands; a little of their work has been
preserved. An equally good thing in the 14th
century was the establishment of the re-
markable Chamber of Rhetoric, which
watched and helped literary endeavor
throughout the then very prosperous Nether-
lands, and became the official arbiter of
Flemish literary and dramatic fame. E or
two centuries and a half letters did very
well in Inlanders, as the other arts also.
But about 1580 the rippling, vivid French
began to creep into the speech and the books,
and the stark terseness of the Flemish to
decline. But not for long. Early in the
17th century it was caught by Baudaert and
Walons with their standard translation of
the Bible, and later in the same century held
fast for a time by Hooft, Vondel, and Cats.
Ilooft was a poet who by force of the poet’s
usual circumstances wrote a history of the
Netherlands; Vondel wrote bitter tragedies
cursing the bi-lingual Government and all As
works ; and Cats was a great poet who by
his circumstances wrote romances, and for
his soul’s sake a great volume of verse which,
collected, has been for 250 years popularly
known and cherished as the “Household
Bible.” For the next hundred years there
was nothing much doing in imaginative work,
but Flemish held its own with E'rench by the
help of some vigorous philologists, notably
Ten Kate and Huydecoper. Napoleon tem-
porarily obscured things by forbidding the
official use of blemish in the Belgian pro-
vinces, but the revolution of 1830 and a few
patriotic scholars let in the light again until
.Leopold II. of the Congo stink brought the
painted ladies and the asphalt.
It will be long before the Flemish heart
recovers from Leopold. Gradually the houses
and the speech, the thought and the lives m
the towns, became French. Verhaeren. Cam-
maerts, Maeterlinck —these are European
poets caught up into the French music, the
delicate E’rench skill, and far away even in
thought from the uncompromising unadorned
Flemish strength. The fields were always
a battlefield, actual or potential, and the
burghers’ backs were always stiffened against
the walls of the towns; yet for centuries
the Lowlands were the richest lands m
Europe, temporally and spiritually. Grown
rich in constant menace, in constant turmoil
of the great thieves at the gates, no orna-
ment or music is natural to the nation s
spirit; it is quick, strong and admirable
rather than . fascinating or gentle and
musical. There has never been any time tor
the twiddley bits, in thought or speech. But
Leopold drained the life out of the cities at
least. He made Ostend and all the French
hotels, the French newspapers, the French
books and thought, the famous French poets.
He drove the rugged keenness out of the
gates along the wet white roads to the ‘ first
principles” of the mediaeval farms and
taverns. And I expect it is watching and
waiting there for the noise of this hundredth
war to die away, so that, Leopold being
dead and unmourned, it can come back when
the time is ripe again.

BUILD the PERFECT BICYCLE
The bicycle built with B.S.A. Fittings is guaranteed to give long and efficient
service. For over sixty years the B.S.A. Co. has maintained a world-wide
reputation for quality of materials and workmanship, and to-day thousands of
experienced riders in many countries testify to the reliable, trouble-free service
which is now expected from B.S.A. machines.
How many out-of-the-way places of beauty and interest have you planned
“some day” to visit, but continually put off on account of the time taken to
get there? With a bicycle backed by a reputation such as the B.S.A. you
can depend upon a speedy and comfortable journey without any of the uncertainty
felt when riding a cheap and unreliable machine. The pleasures of your outing
commence from the moment you mount your bicycle, instead of from when
you actually arrive at your destination. Should you, through accident, break
or lose any part of your B.S.A. bicycle the rigid system of interchangeability
ensures you obtaining a new component in the shortest possible time and with
a minimum of inconvenience.

Husband suffering from the morning-after
feeling, tries to be the perfect little gentle-
man (Adelaide dailies, 7/12/’2O) :
This is to certify that the statement I made
against my wife at the police-station is clear in my
mind to be untrue. I was under the influence of
drink at the time, and suffering from a scalp wound.
I also wish that the same may appear in the eyes
of the public, and exonerate my wife from all blame.
I have never known my wife to use a gun in my life,
nor was there a gun in our room at the time.
(Signed) .
“Rounds”: Melbourne General Sessions
has just heard its most unconventional ver-
dict —or an addendum to a verdict, perhaps.
A jury found a man guilty of receiving, but
strongly recommended him to mercy.
Judge Dethridge fidgeted with some papers
and then remarked that prisoner was already
undergoing a sentence. “Ah, then” —after
a hurried consultation, “better cut the mercy
out, your Honor,” said the foreman. But
his Honor wasn’t ferocious —he only made it
seven months.
“Splinter”: The fact that about half the
time of District Court Sessions on the N. S.
Wales North Coast is occupied with Hindu
v. Hindu cases is largely due to the other
fact that the turbaned scoundrels bet in big
money about the results. The cases are based
on all manner of alleged fraudulent cattle and
other transactions, and often the plaintiff de-
liberately leaves himself open to the defend-
ant, in the hope that the latter will do some-
thing which will form the foundation for a
lawsuit. It’s a nice game, which gives Ram
Chunder great satisfaction, but unfortunately
it costs the State mopey. A close inspection
for perjury and a few prosecutions therefor
might do a lot of good.
“Oediv”: While “Jack Carse” (B.
9/12/’2O) may be right in suggesting that the
memory of Florence Young may be per-
petuated in better ways than suggested by the
Alfred Hospital authorities, his remarks
anent. the setting up of an operating theatre
suggest a state of intelligence which it would
bo impolite to describe. One cannot believe
that the author of such remarks has ever
been present at an operation, or that he has
any acquaintance with surgery. Ordinary
commonsense, however, should prevent any-
one from describing as a chamber of horrors
a place where pain and suffering are relieved
and a new lease of life is given. Exactly
who experiences the horrors it would be hard
to say. Certainly no such impression is pro-
duced on the surgeon or the staff, and the
patient before being brought into the theatre
is anaesthetised, though he isn’t “inanimate,”
as “Jack Carse” has it. We are asked to
believe that it is more worthy to add to the
superabundant means of pleasure at present
in existence than to increase the means of re-
lieving the suffering around us. Such ideas
are particularly out of place at present, when
hospital supers, are pointing out the total
inadequacy of the means at their disposal,
when the ward's of our city hospitals are
overtaxed, and when cases which really ought
to be admitted are turned way in an ambu-
lance because there is absolutely no room for
them. It was Nero, wasn’t it, who played
the fiddle when there was real work to be
done? I don’t believe Florence Young had
the least affection for him.
“Gunner”: Michael Cruise, of Sydney, has
made a test case of an unsavory issue. An
S.P.C.A. inspector found one of his horses
abandoned and starving in a. park, and after
puting it out of its misery,' got the owner
fined at the Paddington Police Court for
cruelty. On appeal against the cruelty con-
viction Cruise went down, costs being given
against him. and the inspector’s action
acclaimed. He next had the nerve to claim
£23 damages for the loss of the horse. Judge
Cohen gave him 55., on the technical point
that the inspector’s action was ultra
vires, and refused costs. But though it
did well in this case the powers of
the Bench to help along the cause of com-
mon decency are lamentably restricted. At
South Melbourne at about the same time as
Cruise was taking his medicine a heartless
ruffian named James Barker was con-
victed of thrashing two horses with a chain
till they were “exhausted” and covered with
cuts, one of the latter being “nine inches
long and half an inch wide.” He was handed
the limit, which is a £5 fine. A conference of
Sydney magistrates recently recommended
that the maximum penalty under the N. S.
Wales P.C.A. Act should be at least £lO.
There are special cases, such as this, where
gaol without the option woudn’t be excessive.
“Exile”: “F. 0.” called attention (B.
2/12/’2O) to the loss that results to people
who grow vegetables and fruit from market
_gluts and bad weather. In California, last
year I learnt about the new way to save the
tons of garden stuff that were formerly
lost because of excessive supplies ripening
at one time and the difficulties of quick mar-
keting. Dehydration is this new way. There
are several methods, but the best is to
evaporate the water without breaking the
cells of the food and reducing its bulk with-
out altering it chemically; later it can be
brought back to its original condition by-
adding water. During the war the
British Army used 450 million pounds of
fo'Gs thus dried, and the U.S.A. Army 60
million pounds. The food so preserved loses
only size and weight, but not flavor or nutri-
ment or heat value. Ten pounds weight of
potatoes can be dried down to lib weight, «o
that one railway car or ship can carry as
much as ten cars or ships do now of canned or
frozen food. Think of the saving in space and
freight and cost of handling. A new “per-
fected” method of dehydration is a result of
the war. In Germany in 1914 there were
488 potato-drying plants in operation; in
1917 no less than 1900 plants and 2000
breweries were being used. The American
Division of Dehydration reduced 500 million
pounds of raw foods to 50 million pounds
by the process. The dried products weighed
25,000 tons and were sent in five ship-
loads instead of 50. Some things such as
sugar-beets even improve by being dehy-
drated, for the process adds to their sugar-
contents. The following are better when
dehydrated than canned or dried ; Potatoes,
carrots, beans, parsnips, turnips, cauliflower,
cabbage, kale, spinach, leeks, parsley, corn,
peppers, tomatoes, Brussels sprouts, endive,
celery, rhubarb, pumpkin, squash, apples,
pears, peaches, plums, strawberries, rasp-
berries, gooseberries, currants, grapes, apri-
cots and cherries. Fruit must be perfectly
ripe when dehydrated, and the process stops
decay.

After shilling (more or less) for 29 years
the Austral Light, a monthly Melbourne
magazine, has been extinguished. An
average loss of £4O a year would not have
deterred the authorities of the R.C. Church
v hich ran it. but prosDects were gloomy,
and it was thought wise to switch off. J.
v- O Meara, chief clerk at Dalgetv’s,
made the Light his hobby, and was ‘for
.w ars the honorary editor. T. C. Brennan
latterly supplied well-written notes, each of
them a leaderette; and Ronald Stewart, now

helped to keep ,th,e flicker going so long.
Spangles : One Australian circus firm
had in its gang an animal trainer with a
weakness rare among manipulators of the big
cats—he loved gin and occasionally allowed
“.Set /, he better of him. and the common
beliet of the hands was that it would vet get
him into serious trouble. One day lie was
reported drunk and missing. Really he was
at rest under a hotel bod. “Search the
stables. ’ ordered the boss. The stables were
searched. No trainer. “Search tile dressing-
room. ’ Again no trainer. “Search the town. - ’
the town did not yield up the trainer. "Oh.
n search the lions,” wailed the boss.
“Percy Pawnticket”: In the past I have
occasionally wondered how the problem of
dealing with my mortal remains will be
faced by the people who go through my
pockets and find several expired pawn-tickets,
a bank-book (overdrawn), four and sixpence
in poker-machine coupons, and three and
sevenpenee ha’penny in cash. Recently,
however, I discovered the “improved funeral.”
A pauper planting costs libs., but for a
bver you can get an “improved” funeral,
which includes a modern tely-decent, colon
and a private strip of the cemetery. There is
no hearse; the body is removed in the night
to the Mortuary, and goes to Rookvvood by
train, but I never heard of anyone who
enjoyed a ride in a hearse, anyhow. And,
failing cremation, the “improved” funeral
will do me. It has removed my greatest
dread of death.
J.R.D. : r l he Bowen steel proposition,
which is such a bitter pill to Brisbane land-
sharks, is a re-incarnation. In 1896 the
Barkers, who were then spending money iu
*'•'<!• mines, put a IA-niillion “general metal-
lui£Y scheme on the London and American
markets and nearly succeeded. The writer
represented a Yankee syndicate, and others
in it were F. A. Muller (Brisbane) and
1 ratal and Buic-k (London). A metropoli-
tan combine did its best to spoil Bowen’s
chance. The Barkers took up Tamrookuni.
on the I.ogan, in 1843, afterwards adding
Mt. l.arconibe. Nindoo.mba.
Lungella, Uranah. Emu Plains. Carpentaria
Downs, Rosella, Highbury and Nelia I’onds
they also launched out in sugar, and floated
tin* Mt. Barker Mines, Ltd., and the Barker
I urbine Co. A favorite scheme of R. P.
Barker’s was to dam the Broken River and
turn its water into Cattle Creek, Mueka.v.
’The energy derived by the 3000 ft. dive into
that creek would, lie reckoned, drive every
sugar-mill # in Mackay and leave something
for electric light and trams.
“.Spare CoTp”: A curious tiling about
some Tommy officers was that they had a
kind of wondering admiration for our utter
irreverence, and yet they were stern dis-
ciplinarians among their own men. A cap-
tain who affably introduced himself to me
on top of a motor-’bus and took possession
ol me for the afternoon was, I learned
subsequently from a Tommy sergeant-major
who had seen me with him, a regular mar-
tinet to his company. I found him excess-
ively hospitable, but all the time I was
haunted by the feeling that he expected me
to' go wild. 1 conjectured that he was dis-
appointed that I didn’t chuck the driver
into the Strand or something of the sort,
hut he protested that it wasn’t so, and ho
certainly, got a vast amount of entertainment
out of many quite small things—for instance,
my off-hand “llullo, Jim !” when we passed
an exalted A.I.F. staff-officer. The latter
happened to be a friend of mine, but I sup-
pose my Tommy pal is telling them in
Twickenham to this day how the Austra-
lians had a habit of calling their generals
“Bill” and “Jim.”
“Perim”: I have just met this old friend :
At the meeting of the P. and 0. Company yester-
day, the chairman, Lord Inchcape, regretted that
they were compelled to raise passenger rates. It
was not the company’s fault. They were now carry-
m>j passengers at less than cost.
It is about 25 years since I first heard that
from the purser of the now-dead Parramatta.
I have frequented P. and O. and Orient
steamers at intervals ever since, and on
every trip I have been given to understand
sooper or later that the business was a sort
of charity. I travelled on four different
transports during the war. and all of them
were conducted at a dead loss. Not only
did the Diggers eat more rations than the
Government paid for, but their destructive-
ness was a constant drain on the resources
of any eo. which carried them. I was usu-
ally told this before disembarkation, when
the Expeditionaries were being lined up
to have their pay-books debited with
"shortages.” The skippers invariably justi-
fied the fantastic prices put on their mis-
lay blankets and dented tinware by set-
ting against them the outrageous appetites
of the Australian officers and men ; and one
complained bitterly that he should be fated
to carry such people instead of the quiet and
frugal Y\ est African negroes to whom he
had been accustomed. Bearing such ex-
periences in mind, it is a never-failing
source of stupefaction to me, who am no
business man, that the shipping cos. should
contrive to keep financially afloat as they
f * o- i- j l< v an fl O. managed to make a
profit of x890,64f> in 3917, of £919,428 in
3938, and of £1,653,257 in 1939. During
391 (. when the submarine campaign was at
its worst, Furness, Withy and Co., which
led m transport work, paid 20 per cent, tax
free on the Ordinary shares, and carried
forward £3.j6.590. The British .Steamship
Investment Trust paid 30 p.c. on deferred
•stock, a bonus of 30 p.c. less tax, and an
interim bonus of 10 p.c., making a total
or oO p.c. for the year. If the answer is
that passengers are borne at a loks and that
the profits come from the transport of those
goods with which nations pay their
debts, then I .ask why should the globe-
trotter, who_ is mostly a useless sort of per-
son. be subsidised at the expense of the stay-
at-home worker ?


A Great Loss and a
Greater Gain.
This business has ‘rounded out six years’
existence by distributing to owners more
than five hundred thousand cars.
Price concessions on this car are rarely
asked, and never given with Dodge Brothers’
consent or to their knowledge.
You can therefore figure accurately the
amount invested by the public in Dodge
Brothers cars, by multiplying the output by
the retail selling price.
There have been no bursts of speed in the
upbuilding.of this great business.
At no time has there been even an attempt
at stimulation of sales or of production.
Never for a single day has production been
speeded up for the sake of obtaining a total.
On the contrary, it has been held down every
day within the limits of close, careful, con-
scientious manufacturing.
Both production and sales have been stable,
steady and spontaneous —scrupulous care on
the one producing huge volume in the other.
At this moment, as at every other period,
although producing a large volume every day,
Dodge Brothers are “losing business'’ by
their policy of keeping production within the
bounds of continuous betterment.
In that sense they have doubtless suffered a
great loss in the past and will endure a
great loss in the future.
But oVer against this great loss is an
infinitely greater gain.
The people have implicit faith in the integrity
of Dodge Brothers' manufacturing methods.
Five hundred thousand owners —or, rather,
five hundred thousand families —are of one
mind concerning the car and the men who
make it.
This business and its product are blessed with
a friendship probably without parallel in the
history of American manufacturing.
Fresh from the factory, or .sold at second-
hand, from one end of the nation to the
other, the car has special value-and a special
reputation, because of the name it bears.
Because of the name it bears, you may be
sure that the principle behind the car will
never be changed a hair’s breadth.
Dodge Brothers have only one idea in the
upbuilding of their business.
That idea is to build so soundly and so well
that the goodwill which they have won will
grow and endure forever.
Their own lifelong zeal for good workman-
ship is sharpened and stimulated by a
realisation of what the public expects from
them.
The entire institution is honestly permeated
with the idea that qualitv and performance
are paramount and all-important.
And so. a standard which was naturally high
has been made higher still, by the bestowal
of complete confidence on the part of the
public.
It is a mutual contract which offers constant
inspiration to the manufacturer and constant
insurance to the customer.

MOTOR CAR
It has come to be known as a substantial car, and
naturally that has attracted to it substantial people.
When a man decides to buy, he is thinking of the

He is thinking of the satisfaction of having a car

A very rich man died recently in Sydney.
His home included a “library.” and 27'pic-
tures were distributed about the premises.
The sworn testimony of the valuators was
that the collection of literature in the library
was worth £3 and that five bob each would
be a fair thiug to give for the works of art.
“Gallery”: There are now 156 picture
shows of one sort and another in Melbourne
and its suburbs, and the new Health Com-
mission has decided that even if the least
desirable of them were closed there would
still be plenty left. So there is to be a
thorough inspection, followed no doubt by
orders to make many structural alterations
to ensure safety. Which is going to be the
next pretext for a pretty common raising
of rates.
With money tight and no export trade the
Anakie (Q.) sapphire field has slumped
badly the last month or two. The Govern-
ment has so far failed in its attempts to
market the gems for the digger. Only £4OO
worth of stones were purchased localiy dur-
ing November, and the more recent arrivals
are giving the field best. A nice fancy “blue”
changed hands privately at 60 guineas, but
stones such as this are only occasional
plums in a very large pudding.
Land and Water is the latest London
publication to discontinue. It merges with
the Field, from which it was an offshoot
half a century ago. When the war should
have killed it Hilaire Belloc and others rose
to the occasion and made it an authority
on war-topics. With peace it changed again
to gossipy comment on sport, finely printed
and illustrated with action-photos. Sewell,
Belloc and the new humorist A. P. Herbert
have been constant contributors. In its
modern guise it was not a rival to the Field
at all, and why that paper should want to
absorb it is a mystery.
“Costs”: In the Yic. Legislative Ass. re-
cently, while the Juries Bill was under dis-
cussion, Wallace, M.L.A., voiced a fallacy
which hasn’t even the merit of being popu-
lar : ,
A Crown Prosecutor has his reputation to maintain,
and, like detectives, his principal object is to secure
convictions.
The ingenuous Wallace, after mentioning
that “there was nothing more corrupt in life
than the administration of the law,” con-
cluded that the Crown’s "tendency.... in a
criminal ca.se is to prevent individuals who
are in conflict with it from getting a fail*
deal.” It would be fortunate for the male-
factor class if it were so, since convictions
Would automatically be reduced to a mini-
mum, It may sound paradoxical, but the
most successful Crown Prosecutor is the one
who never struggles for a conviction—a logi-
cal extension of the well-known fact that
juries hesitate to convict where the pre-
scribed punishment is out of proportion to
the offence. The best, and incidentally the
deadliest, prosecutor any Australian State
has known in recent years was Justice Wade,
of JV S. Wales. He put every case with
judicial impartiality. A hanging Judge and
a conviction-seeking prosecutor—these are
the two best friends of a guilty accused nowa-
days, and only in our Parliaments does the
impression seem to linger that things are
otherwise.
It is time Sydney realised how its public
parks are being stolen. The Zoo site
Moore Park has gone: a girls’ school is to
be built there. An acre and a half has just
been torn off Hyde Park, largely for the
benefit of Elizabeth and Park street land-
lords. The Defence Department recently
grabbed one part of the Domain and Sydney
Hospital another, while a road was run
through Cook Park and an electric-light
station erected in Lang Park. The St.
Mary’s Cathedral authorities are claiming
the top part of Phillip Park, and further
elaborate refreshment kiosks are projected.
The latest and crowning swindle is a pro-
posal to build a stadium or circus in which
to hold buckjumping shows at the corner
ot Elizabeth and Liverpool streets. This is
the block of Hyde Park which was first
stolen by the State Government for the city
railway, then taken over by the Defence
Department as a recruiting depot, and
finally left by both authorities to become a
public eyesore. The Works Department has
already signified its approval of the new
scheme, and no one in the know doubts that
it is going through. There is onlv one thing
to be said in the favor of successive N. S.
Wales Governments where alienations of the
sort are concerned : they act with con-
sistency. It is well in the picture that
administrations which pile debt on the
shoulders of posterity should also rob the
unborn of their city air-spaces.
“Jake” on the dangers of a little know-
ledge :
The public-health picture recently exhibited in N.
S. Wales is said to be the first of a long line of
similar films. In the circumstances a word to
Messrs. Mutch and McGirr might be helpful. As
these pictures stand (assuming the recent one is a
fair sample) they can do no real good and they
may do much harm. Take my experience. I en-
listed at the age of 18, and had up till that time
scarcely heard of venereal disease. The army im-
pressed me with its dangers, and the other night I
took the heroic step of escorting my two flapper
nieces to a V.D. film. I was dissatisfied with the
result, so at home I pursued the subject with a
lecturette and found that the girls had drawn con-
clusions something after this style: (!)• Every man
is willing to ruin any girl at any time; (2) 80
per cent, of the male sex is tainted with V.D.;
(3) venereal disease is very similar to measles;
(4) they will never marry. Now from my army
experience of a few lectures and camp-talk I have
straightened things out as well as I could for those
girls, and they promised, if a shade half-heartedly, to
tell their cobbers. But how about the thousands of
flappers (and youths) whose ideas will remain
tangled? Of course, there is a remedy, and a simple
pne, in the lecturette. I haven’t the faintest idea
what the Public Health body or the importing firm
makes out of these pictures; but every firm gaining
permission to exhibit one of them in Australia
should be forced to maintain relays of lecturers
nominated by the Government, and fully qualified
to lighten the darkness of youth on such subjects.
Many of these lecturers, being public men, would
probably be pleased to give their services gratis.
But except to attract the crowd, would the films
then be necessary for this propaganda? Is not one
“straight talk” by a Chaplain Mackenzie or an
Ettie A. Rout Hornibrook worth a million faked-
up horrors ?

LEADERSHIP can only be maintained by unbudgingly upholding a pre-
eminent standard of value. Our ability to sell a shirt of dependable quality
for so low a price as 8/6 is evidence that even in these times of abnormal

The Heart of New Guinea.
[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
THE gloom of the gorge was deepening
as I struggled against the cold, roar-
ing waters pduring down from Mt.
Lawson, which stood just ahead of me, like
a huge lonely sentinel, marking in the heart
of New Guinea the boundaries of two
Governments.
Travelling towards the head of the Mabaha
River in quest of some men of the Kukukuku
tribe wanted for the murder of a‘ prospector’s
shooting “boy” who had wandered into the
forbidden country of the mountain dwellers,
I had managed to approach within coo-ee of
a temporary fishing house without being
observed. The “track” was in the river
under 3ft. of swiftly-running water, here
7000 feet above sea-level. 1 was a little
ahead of the native police escort, and was
rounding a huge boulder in the river where
the swirl of water was as much as I could
stand against, when I caught sight of a wild
pig drinking at the water’s edge. I snapped
up a cartridge from the magazine, and the
rifle had almost reached my shoulder when
the supposed pig moved—and resolved itself
into two human beings, a woman and a child,
the latter a mere infant. Pressing back
against the boulder, for a lucky moment I
watched them undisturbed. A Kukukuku
woman —a rare sight for any white man!
Some forty yards from where I stood' the
quite naked mother was bending over her
young, which on hands and knees was drink-
ing at the water’s edge. Only that I saw,
and then .suddenly the woman stood erect,
holding her head high, searching with her
eyes, and scenting with her nostrils, for the
something she had sensed.
The following night, at about the same
hour, in a blinding rainstorm amongst the
crags and pinnacles of the Olipai Heights,
that same woman fought and bit fiercely into
my wrists whilst I was endeavoring to fasten
the handcuffs on a young warrior—probably
her son. As a result of that raid he anil
two other Ivukukukus were captured and
sent to Port Moresby, in order that they
might at least be taught something about the
Government, the wrong of killing mankind,
and what the strange white men really were.
The captives, however, were complete fail-
ures when regarded as pupils. One of them,
unable to withstand the enforced exile and
the bewildering, hitherto undreamed of
things around him, the fierce heat, the rain-
less, hopeless region of Port Moresby, just
pined away and died ; and the others were
going the same way when I happened to
arrive in the capital. They had been form-
ally charged with murder, but as the
authorities could not understand a word that
was said, by them, and as there was no-one
who could explain the charge, the proceed-
ings were abandoned.
Amongst their mountain crags and pinnacles
they were the embodiment of strength,
fierce and untamable as the wind ; when I
saw them at Port Moresby they had become
dull of eye, pot bellied and slack of skin,
and. without a semblance of their former
agility. The medical-officer assured me
that the man who had died had nothing
organically wrong with him. The enforced
exile, the incessant longing for the dew and
damp of his mountains, and the lack of
knowledge as to whether he would see them
again had simply proved too much for him.
The other two had not learned to understand
even the simplest of dialects tried upon
them. They had resisted all the attempts
made to teach them, maintaining a stony
silence or nodding their heads in an ex-
asperating affirmative when anything at all
was said. When I arrived in the Port, they
were sent for and brought into the room.
They showed nothing but a blank, hopeless
unconcern. When, however, I spoke a word
or two of their language the effect was
magical. Turning swiftly their eyes lit, their
mouths opened in astonishment. Then re-
cognising me the younger man sprang to
me and held on to my arm (not under-
standing my proffered hand) and burst into
a. torrent of words in which I could only
distinguish an appeal. The strangers around
were good inasmuch as they gave him
foods, albeit strange and at first unpalatable,
and they did not attempt to kill him; but
they did not know his country, nor the way
to get to it, and that was the only thing
he wanted to know. So even when his
enemy, the cause of all his trouble, turned
up he was clung to.
Every day whilst I remained in the
settlement they sat on the floor of the office
and watched me work, and when the old
evil malaria took me to the little hospital
°u the biscuit-colored hill above the town
they squatted near my bed, apparently in
sympathy, but really, I believe, concerned
only with hanging on to me as a means of
getting back to their mountains.
One of them I did take back to Lake-
kamu, for it was thought that he, too, would
die. Getting off the river launch at Tiveri
after five long days in its narrow limits,
with the fearful “toof-toof” (engine)
always near him, he caught a glimpse of
Mt. Lawson, and would have glided away
into the jungle there and then had I so
allowed. But he w T as too ill and weak for
the three days’ hard climb to his home, and
I wanted to take him to the station first.
On the six miles of hilly though not diffi-
cult track to Nepa he rolled about like a
drunken man, but would not rest. After
the dried-up town in which he had lived
tor some months the scents and dews of the
jungle urged him on remorselessly. Arriving
at the station, his distress drove him to
tears. The following morning he would
have stolen away at dawn.
I had a small bag of food and presents
made up for him. Taking him on to the
and pointing towards Lawson, I
told him by signs and words that he was
tree to go. “Hingowe, hingowe!” he said,
and would have left me without taking the
tood, but this I pressed upon him. Yet I
might have saved myself the trouble, for a few
moments later we saw him, as he stood sil-
houetted on the high ridge that commands
the station, fling the bag and its contents
tai \ trom h lm - _ A minute later he was gone
—the mountains swallowed him, and the
tribe once again closed its doors to the Gov-
ernment and the white man.

Business, Robbery, etc.
“Gas-burner”: The Melbourne Gas Co.
sells a good Australian gas-stove for iti. new.
I kicked hard when the Brighton Gas_Co., a
small suburban concern, asked £7 7s. for
a second-hand Article. It was scornfully
explained that the big co.’s stoves were
“locally-made”: the others were imported,
and, of course, so superior that they were
worth more second-hand than the Australian
stoves straight from the factory. I de-
parted marvelling that this small, swollen-
headed suburban co. should deign to use
Australian coal.
“Impecunious Artist” : He lived in a room
in the building in which L occupied a hat-
box, in a South Melbourne suburb. He was
an extremely early bird, but seemed to have
much of the afternoon and all the evening
to himself. We had been casually acquainted
for some time, and I had often cause to be
astonished at his well-stocked eellarette
’even before I learned~that he drove a milk-
man’s delivery-cart. “But how the deuce
do you manage it?” I asked, directing atten-
tion to the bottles. “Oh. that’s easy,” saul
lie. “Those are peeks!” “Whisky a
milkman’s perquisite! But how?” “Easy.
Take that bottle of whisky, for instance.
A bottle of beer went with it. 1 picked
them up on Sunday morning. _ Sunday morn-
ing is the best time for us.” He had me
beaten. “Doesn’t it occur to you?” he went
on “You know the proverb about coming
in with the milk? Well, it is still our good
luck to meet a few. The man who owned
that whisky was lying on his own back
verandah, denied admission by a prohibition
missus. He had brought a bottle in each
pocket to soothe his morning hours: but
could the conscientious milkman leave them
with him? No!” Now I understand why
it is next to impossible for a penniless artist
to obtain a milk-o's position in or about this
metropolis.

For the benefit of Federal members the
Magpie Pipe Co., a returned soldiers' affair,
ran a show of its pipes in Queen’s Hall,
Parliament House, lately. Incidentally, it
got a recommendation from Customs Min-
ister Massy Greene, who said that a Magpie
pipe was as good as any he had ever tasted.
Native cherry, red-gum and Gippsland kanu-
ka are among the various Australian woods
that have proved just the thing for this job.

“F.C.”: More results of taking tickets in
the wild gamble of going on the land. Just
now Mulgrave and Moorabbin (Vic.) are
fat with potatoes, but it is wet weather, and
the growers must rush them in. This time
last year spuds brought from 15s. to 20s.
a case of about 401 b.; to-day they go oil
slowly at from 3s. to 4s. Moorabbin also
has a fair dose of lettuces, which aren’t very
filling, but Melbourne is rushing them at
from 3s. to 6s. per dozen. Admittedly
lettuces take more working than spuds, but
where seed and manure for the salad cost
a shilling, for the tuber they cost £l.
Heaven knows why people are so keen on
lettuces. Perhaps the scarcity of tomatoes
has something to do with it. To grow this
fruit now you have to go. to the Backblocks,
away from long-cultivated districts, so as to
escape the blight or dry rot or foot-and-mouth
disease or whatever it is. Anyhow, toma-
toes are worth £1 a case wholesale, and il
they can be produced at Dryberra that
lamentable void might yet turn itself to
some use.
“Mrs. Lance Rawson”: Apropos of de-
veloping the fisheries (B. 25/11/'2O), what
is there against canneries for the season
only? There are many places where fish
(specially mullet) can be caught in thou-
sands as thev pass up to spawn at the heads
of the rivers. In nearly all the Queensland
bavs the mullet run up from February to
June, and can then be netted in myriads
daily. The salting and smoking is easy
work. There is nothing to prevent small
parties of men with a boat or two and a
couple of good nets setting up their camp
for the four months while the fish run up.
The outlay would not be great, and they
would surely make a few hundreds among
them.
“Copabella”: Geelong was visited some
time ago by a company-promoter. It was
at a time when the city was stung with a
desire to boost itself on Yankee lines that
a philanthropist or two offered it the right
to manufacture a patent syphon which was
to revolutionise the manufacture and popu-
larity of whisky-and-soda. _ A local company
was formed, and some £5OOO paid for the
privilege of creating the flagon. Another
philanthropist discovered in the wilds of
the Otwav Forest a deposit of sand which
would revolutionise the construction of the
ordinary dead-marine. The local company
bought this, too—for £l5OO or so.. To while
away the time pending the materialisation of
the mysterious syphon, it was decided to earn
a little immediate cash by the manufacture
of common bottles, and model works on a
small scale were erected and blowers engaged.
Then it was discovered that if the works
worked to capacity the annual loss must
be about £OOO a year. At this point the
promoter faded away, and the syphon-
patentee was blotted out, too. Then the
Australian Glassware Co., which had been
lying low and sayin’ nullin', in response to
the Geelong board’s SOS made an offer
which would give shareholders about Bs. in
the £ and the lesson of their secluded lives.
The big combination would touch
the vaunted syphon, which it valued at a
fiver: nor the deposit of super-sand, which
it valued not at all. With a sigh of relief
the co. accepted, offered the owner of the
.sand £750 not to insist on selling it to them,
and laid away the syphon rights along with
the family skeletons.
“Unley”: Wild-liquorice root was one
of the joys of my youth, but as far as I
know no one in Australia has yet produced
liquorice for commercial purposes. How-
ever. Gawler (S.A.I is having a shot at it.
A disadvantage of the liquorice crop is that
it is three years before the roots are ready
for use. But a fair average harvest is 7 or
8 cwt. an acre, and the brewer buys the
stuff as well as the chemist and the confec-
tioner.

A trapper at Lumsdon, the turn-off place
to the Cold Lakes of Mgoriland. won’t agree
with the mutton-growers of those tussocky
regions that bunny is a curse. The other
day he pocketed a cheque for £l(i!> for 2!)
days’ trapping—-£5 16s. (»d. per diem. Even
an Australian M.P. can’t do as well —unless
he does it “on the side.”

“Miirkah": Recently in Rivorina I
watched a chaffeutter preparing a sample
for the local show. The owner bad waited
for a light breeze across the machine, the
door of which was open so that clouds of
chaff shot out in front. The breeze blew the
objectionable “flag” and split straw away:
only “shotty” chaff and grain landed on the
tarpaulin. When sufficient had been cut it
was poured on the riddle and thus to the
bag. where the pressure, which ordinarily
jambs it to the limit, was greatly eased, so
that the grinding screw would not split the
sample. However, the swindle is quite fair
—everybody does it. For the sheaf compe-
tition the straws were prepared with a
coarse comb which removed flag. etc. The
straws we're then placed in the packers of
the binder and the wheel was turned, thus
securing the correct paddock appearance and
the tvpical binder-knot. But as everyone
does it that is fair enough too.

“Dolphin” on the golden age:—-
Modern gold-digging began with the rush to Cali-
fornia in 1848 awl 1849. And there has not been
a big gold find since, from the Klondike to Tierra
del Fuego and from Siberia to Southland, at which
Australians have not had a finger in the pie. Gold
has changed >-■ • face of the world in the last 72
years. It was the great discoveries i "
which sent the Americans across the continent to
the Pacific. Next came the Australian < iggmgs, ou
of which grew modern Australia, he finding
of gold in the Transvaal led to the S. . r
and eventually to the union of South Atnea 11
these events had their beginnings one “
1848, when Marshall, a man from VS. Wales,
ordered some Indians to deepen a water-race at
Suttor's Fort, in California, near the site of the
present city of Sacramento. .
As Edward Hammond Hargraves tells the story in
the little book he wrote about liis experiences in
California and his discovery of gold in N. , . 1 ales.
Captain Suttor, a Yankee who had obtained a grant of
60,000 acres in the San Joaquin 4 alley, decided
to put up a sawmill. He needed an engineer, and
sent to San Diego for Marshall, who had drifted
across from N. S. Wales. When Marshall had erected
his mill he found that the water-race was not deep
enough, and put some Indians on deepening it. While
they were at work Marshall noticed some yellow
specks in the dirt thrown up from the race. It was
the real Mack ay. Neither Marshall nor Suttor knew
anything about gold-washing, but on the place was
an old miner from Georgia, apd he showed them
how to make a rough cradle and wash the pay-dirt.
So began the diggings at Suttor’s Fort, and out
of that came the rush to California in which llai-
graves joined in 3840. He returned in 1851 to find
gold at Ophir and on the 'I uron, the first-fruits
of the £600;000,000 worth since dug out in Aus-
tralia.

DR. SHELDON’S GIN PILLS
Banish Backache and Kidney Troubles.
SO WHY SUFFER?
Do you rise in the morning with a groan? Do you feel that you are getting old? Having made up your mind'that you are a
martyr, do you vent your ill-humor on the family? After a while the pain and stiffness leave you, and you forget your troubles until the next
morning, when the same dull pain in the small of the back and the difficulty of bracing your nerves bring back all the dire forebodings of the
day before.
This is the way kidney trouble creeps on its victim, and you are starting on a long journey towards ill-health and infirmity. Ihe
kidneys are overtaxed with the work of cleansing out the impurities from your blood. Each day there is an accumulation of waste which
must upset the body. It forms uric acid, and uric acid is the most insidious form of poisoning that can take place in your body. It is the
duty of every man, not only to himself but to the world at large, to keep bis health in the proper condition for his daily task, and for the
victim of Kidney Trouble Dr. Sheldon's Gin Pills give just the little boost his organs need to make them his slave, instead of his being a
slave to ill-health.

Coco ark ut Oil Makes
an Elegant Hair Wash.
Girls and women who wish to keep their
hair in nice condition should be most cautious
in the soap they wash it with. Most
soaps and ready-mixed shampoos contain
excessive quantities of alkali. This dries
the scalp, makes the hair brittle and is very
injurious. Just ordinary colinated cocoanut
oil (a pure, saponified but quite greaseless
liquid) is far better than the most costly
soap you could possibly use for a shampoo,
for this cannot possibly hurt your hair.
Merely wet your hair with water and rub it
on. A couple of teaspoonsful makes a perfect
flood of rich, thick, creamy lather, and
cleanses both hair and scalp thoroughly. The
lather rinses out easily, and takes with it
every trace of dust, dirt, dandruff or excessive
oiliness. The hair dries quickly and evenly,
and comes out fine and silky, bright, glossy
and fluffy, appearing to be heavier than it is.
And, best of all, this colinated cocoanut oil
leaves the hair as easy to dress again as
though you hadn’t washed it at all. You can
get colinated cocoanut oil at most any chemist,
but be sure it’s “colinated,” which is not
expensive—a few ounces lasting a long, long
time.
IMPORTANT: Do not confuse colinated cocoanut
oil with cheaper sticky, emulsified cocoanut oils
or other substitutes. There is only one genuine
colinated oil, as recommended above.
Better than Christmas Gift by Santa Claus.
GREAT INVENTION OF EMINENT CHEMIST. A BOON
TO ALL OUR WOMEN FOLK.
You’ve got rings on your fingers, and corns on your toes, and
callouses on the soles of your feet, but why worry and get wrinkles
now?
This midget bottle holds an almost marvellous liquid. A
wizard in chemistry invented this ether substance, named it Frozol-
Ice, and now little bottles of it may be found at the chemists’ shops
for only a few pence. Don’t walk lamely along or distort your
face in torture and ruin your smiling beauty, but find a tiny bottle
of Frozol-Ice, and let drip a few drops on to your sore, sensitive,
throbbing corn or callous, and soon you may lift it out with the
fingers.
Fancy! You gain freedom from a hard corn, soft corn or a
corn between the toes, also leather-like callouses without feeling
it one whit. You have no pain or inflammation when using
Frozol-Ice or afterward.
Drinking Water
With Meals Stops
Stomach Disorders.
Thousands of unfortunate people suffer
almost daily from dyspepsia, indigestion,
fermentation, sour acid stomach, flatulence,
gases or distress after eating. If they would
only form the agreeable habit of slowdy drink-
ing with each meal a glassful of hot water
containing a teaspoonful of pure Salix Mag-
nesia, they would soon find their stomachs so
much strengthened and improved that they
might eat the richest and most satisfying
meals without the ,least symptom of indiges-
tion.
Salix Magnesia is highly effective in stomach
and intestinal disorders, and is very pleasant
to the taste, and in the form of fine powder or
compressed tablets —never liquid or milk--
and is not a laxative. Any first-class chemist
can supply you with this Salix Magnesia.
The Debt Collector.
[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
BECAUSE of the furtive way. he had
approached my office, I guessed he
was a debt-collector; so I told him
when he asked if Mr. Rankin was in that
I was not. It was strictly the truth, too,
because I was only just about to insert the
key in the lock.
“When will he be in?” he asked.
“May be in any minute now,” I said, “but
you may not be able to see him for the
rest of the day.”
He wandered away disconsolately; but in
five minutes he was back again.
“You are Mr. Rankin, are you not?” he
asked.
“Well?”
“It’s about Salem and Corkley’s account
a matter of thirty-two-and-six, which you
have probably overlooked.”
“Who’s Salem and Corkley?” I inquired.
“Well, you ought to know, Mr. Rankin.
It’s only a small amount, and you’d pro-
bably be prepared to pay it right away to
save further trouble. I have been in-
structed”—
“Yes, I know,” I remarked, “to take
proceedings for recovery unless the account
is settled within 24 hours. You’ve run
through .all the stages rather" quickly,
haven’t you—from the polite ‘you have pro-
bably overlooked’ down to the final threat?”
“Salem and Corkley have put the matter
into my hands, with instructions to take all
necessary steps,” he said, lamely. “Of
course, being such a small amount”—
“I don’t know that I know Salem and
Corkley, let alone their account,” I said
blandly. “Seems to me I know your face,
though. Have we met before?”
I was with Pesters, Ltd.,” he mentioned.
I called on you once, and that made me
come back jufft now.”
“Then you ought to have known better
than serve out the crude stuff to me,” I said.
“Are you with Pesters still?”
“No; I’ve set up on my own-"account,”
he answered. “Seeing this bill is only
a small one, you might be prepared to settle
it.”
“Better sit down,” I said, “and after-
wards, if ybu’ll join me, we’ll have a drink.
How does this debt-collecting game go, usu-
ally?”
He looked at me for a moment, and then
he smiled suddenly, and sat down, helping
himself to a cigarette I offered him.
“It’s no use worrying you, I suppose,”
he said resignedly.
“I don’t know,” I retorted. As a matter
of fact, I had just got a fair amount of cash
in hand, out of which it seemed a bare pos-
sibility that Salem and Corkley’s account
might be paid, if it was only to benefit a
young fellow starting for himself. I didn’t
say that, of course; but I mentioned that
while I knew all the threats, forms of demand
and so on of the debt-collecting people I
was curious about the success they-achieved.
He stared hard at me before he relaxed
again into a smile, deciding, seemingly, that
he might as well recognise me as one who
knew the barrenness of the threats to which
I referred.
“Oh, the business pays,” he said, “with
a big firm like Pesters. I’ve been with them
for eight years—ever since I was a boy.
You get some big commissions occasionally:
I’ve known Pesters draw 50 per cent.”
“That must have been a fairly good col-
lection?” I said.
“Oh, I don’t know. It depends on the
firm that puts its accounts into your hands.
Some of them don’t do it until they’ve
tried all they know themselves; but others
just send out the ordinary accounts with
perhaps ‘Cheque will oblige,’ and when the
cheque don’t Oblige they treat the account
as bad. In a case like that the collections
would be good, because there’s plenty always
waif for a shaking up before they pay. But
of course, the bulk of what you do collect
comes from the first letter”
“The ‘You have no doubt overlooked’?” I
interjected.
“Yes. Lots of people shake in their shoes
when they get a letter from a debt-collecting
agency. A firm like Pesters has an advant-
age, you see: they have a journal, and supply
confidential information to subscribers about
people who have asked for credit; and people
who might be in business some day. knowing
that, want to establish their reputation with
the firm as payers. So they rush the sug-
gestion that they have overlooked the account.
Then there are others who are really scared.
I’ve seen them come into the office as if
they’d left home in the middle of breakfast,
and they pay up not only the account, but
the collection-fee and all other charges.”
“Which are robbery,” I said.
“It’s the custom,” he replied with a griu ;
“but it’s not often they are paid. Still, I’ve
known cases where you could get almost
anything. Pesters had one where the man
came down frightened to death by the ‘Notice
before proceeding’ letter. Seeing the bad
funk he was in they said they’d have to
charge him ss. instead of 2s. 6d. for collection
fees on account of the trouble he had given,
and even then they were not certain that
they could stop proceedings. They kept him
waiting in a stew for a whole day before
they consented to withdraw the" summons
that hadn’t been issued, and they charged
him for the summons as well and a guinea
‘solicitor’s costs.’ ”
“Pirates!” I commented. “No wonder
you left ’em.”
“Well, to tell you the truth, I went out
on a little game that one of the other col-
lectors played. When a man has agreed
to pay off by, say, ten-shilling instalments
and isn’t prepared some day to pay the ten
fiob, this chap used to demand a shilling
interest, and most times he collected. I
reckoned that if one man could do it another
could; but then I didn't remember that I
wasn’t the managing-director’s nephew.”
“Pesters, I think, follow the first letter
with one that ‘Our former- communication
has evidently escaped your notice.’ Does
that draw any?”
“Hardly any. Of course, there’s a few
that were made a little nervous by the first
letter who get scared when they find it fol-
lowed up. But not many. Then there’s the
‘As you have disregarded’ thing with the
definite threat of proceedings; the ‘We have
been instructed to forthwith institute pro-
ceedings unless thisuaccount m settled,’ right
down to the ‘Final notice before proceed-
ing.’ That brings in the most —after the
first.”
“It’s not often a summons is really
issued?” I suggested.
“Sometimes; if it’s known that a man is
scarey, it’s worth while ; he may be holding
out as long as he can without making the
thing public, and directly he gets the sum-
mons he caves in. But there’s the risk of
not getting the cost of the summons back
if the man doesn’t cave in. And, anyway,
it’s no advertisement for a debt-collecting
firm to have to take a case to court; their
bluff is that they can get the money before
they go that distance.”
“I wonder you took to the business again
after leaving Pesters. There’s heaps of
other things.”
“I don’t like it,” he assented, “but it’s
the game I’ve been trained to. I went into
an estate-agent’s office when I left Pesters,
and had to prepare the ads. for the papers.
One of the first I wrote was about the sub-
division of the Barerocks Estate, and the next
day the boss belched at me like a volcano.
‘Look here,’ he says, ‘don’t you read the
papers? Here’s yesterday’s paper.’ He put
his finger to a paragraph which stated that
in reply to a deputation the Minister had
said that, although it was not possible to
consider the construction of any more new
railways for some time, the extension sug-
gested by the deputation at Barerocks might
be considered in the future. ‘You saw that,
didn’t you?’ he howled. ‘Yet your ad. didn’t
even mention the railway! Why didn’t you
put in: “Proposed new railway will run
along boundary of estate?” You’ll never suit
this job!’ He made a point of my honesty
in engaging me, too,” said the debt collector,
ruminatively.
“Then I got a job with an auctioneer. We
went out to take an inventory of the furni-
ture in a private hopse an old fellow was
selling, and the old chap hovered about us.
I made the list while the boss called, and as
he seemed to miss one or two things I said
‘There’s that pair of vases,’ or ‘There’s that
card-table,’ and thought I was clever. The
boss would say, ‘So there is ; put it down’;
but directly we got outside he blew off at
me. So I decided that debt collecting was
my line: I didn’t know the tricks of the
other things.”
“We’ll have that drink,” I said, shutting
my desk. “The business isn’t too profitable,
is it?”
“I’m only starting,” he said evasively. “If
I could collect that Salem and Corkley’s ac-
count it would give me a good ad. A kff of
people have failed.”
I smiled.
I have his receipt in full; but only this
morning I received a communication from
Pesters Ltd. politely informing me that they
have been instructed by Salem and Corkley
to make application for the payment of an
account of fl 12s. 6d. which I have no
doubt overlooked. The letter also announces
that 2s. 6d. extra should be included in my
cheque, their collection fee. It is most dis-
couraging when a man decides to pay an
account to find that his honest effort goes
astray like mine has done.
HAMER.
Christmas Amongst Cannibals.
[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
IR boss missis”—and a shadow
fell across the sunlit doorway of the
kitchen. I looked . up from the
pastry-board whereon stood a fine hornbill
pie, and saw the big Mambare corporal.
“Well, Duna,” I said as I nodded my head
in response to the truly royal salute he fav-
ored me with, “what do you want?”
“Sir boss missis, boy on steamer say close
up Clismas along Port Moresby. Clismas he
come here?”
“Why, yes, Duna, I suppose so. You had
Christmas last year, didn’t you?”
“Yes, sir boss, but we have him all-same
white-man Clismas. New Guinea man want
mavaru Ldance feast J-. Suppose you tell
Taubada police-boy no want wiiite-man Clis-
mas, want New r Guinea Clismas?” and he
looked beseechingly at me. Tne native police
always knew where to come when they
wanted favors.
“All right, Duna, I will talk to Taubada
about it” ; and I turned to put my pie into
the oven.
Duna, having received an encouraging
hearing, went on to his next point. “Sir
boss missis, police-boy no want Clismas all
same last time.” I had heard great accounts
of the way the station celebrated the festival
the previous year, and had expected that we
would be called upon to put in a good deal
of time and labor to keep up the standard.
So I looked ~.&t Duna to see what were his
ideas of celebrating the day. Encouraged
by my manner, lie coughed and stepped over
the threshold; then, in a confidential tone,
“You savvy, sir boss missis, lust time Mr.
Jemmins [the last Resident Magistrate was
Mr. Jenkins], he say we have big-fellow
mavaru along Clismas. We parade all-same
every day, and he make all boy run like
hell, and boy he catch him first time he
give him knife for pay; but, sir boss, all
boy run all boy want pay. Behind, he
have pig. Put plenty fat along pig tail, and
tell boy catch pig. That fashion he no
good. Can’t catch pig like that. Proper
fashion catch pig along spear. All time
Taubada make boys work, and say ‘Good
fellow mavaru,’ and give some boys some
thing, some boys nothing. Boy he no savvy
that fashion.”
“Well, Duna,” I said, “tell me what the
boys would like to do, and I will see what
the Taubada says about it.”
His brown face lit up with a smile of
delight, and he gleefully rubbed his hip
against the corner of the kitchen table and
licked the corners of his mouth.
“First time, sir boss missis, we want
plenty lcai-kai. Taubada send along village
and buy pig. Oh, sir boss, up river Bara
people have plenty fat pig. Sell him cheap
along Gov’ment. We want plenty stick
tobacco and newspaper for cigar, plenty sago
and little bit biscuit. Plenty women can
go catch sweet potato and taro, and night-
time we kai-kai our belly full. Day-time
we-fellow want to dance. No want to work
run-aboiit like white man; we want dance
New Guinea fashion.”
A vision of Christmas Day left free for
our own amusements filled me with selfish
glee; so, assuring Duna of my strong sup-
port, I sought my husband and gave the
New Guinea version of how to spend Christ-
mas Day. He was only too glad to have
the burden of the sports taken from his
shoulders, and gave full assent, sending
Duna up the river with presents to the Baras
to be exchanged for fat pigs, which in due
time arrived at the station and were in-
stalled under Duna’s house; and a volun-
tary guard installed itself, lest thievish
Goaribaris should descend and steal. The
cooks seemed to spend all their time for days
in carrying wood for the fires and hauling
great bundles of sago from the store. One
met women staggering in from the swamps
with nets of taro and baskets of kewas.
Sacks of sweet potatoes, bunches of bananas,
heaps of cocoanuts —green for drinking, ripe
for eating—were piled on the barracks veran-
dah. I, too, made preparations, for I
knew what the result of a gorge like this
would be; so I filled Winchester quarts of
Epsom-salts solution all ready for the morn-
ing after.
For several days before the great day there
came from the barracks no sounds of drums
in the evening. The chanting, too, ceased,
to allow the police time to make their
feather head-dresses. My beautiful leghorn
cock, the pride of the poultry yard, appeared
one evening without his tail feathers.
Pollyooly, the cockatoo, suddenly went bald.
Mi-ia, the station hornbill, swooped on to
the verandah and with indignant screech
flicked his featherless tail before me. I
caught my cook-boy rifling the pillows on
the bed of their feathers...
Christmas morning came with the beating
of many drums, the snake-and-lizard skin-
heads of which had been carefully renewed
that they might stand the required strain.
Breakfast was eaten to the chanting of
many voices in a Mambare song, the soloist
being Duna, with a chorus of police. \\ hat
it was all about I do not know, but it seemed
interminable. The giving out of the rations
was an affair of great moment. Stick
tobacco and my contribution of carefully-
hoarded newspaper, tins of salmon and piles
of hard .sliip-biscuits, with a few tins of
bullumacow, were carried down to the bar-
racks kitchen, to be added to the store of food
there. A great squealing told the mournful
tale of-fat pigs speared in the orthodox way.
Then the great mavaruv began. Duna led
forth the Mambare police in solemn pro-
cession, faces painted red and white with
black lines. Head-dresses of cassowary
feathers waved in the breeze. The arm and
leg ganas had bunches of gay-colored crotons
and sweet-smelling herbs tucked in them;
belts were gay with turkey Ted calico and
dangling feather ornaments, amongst which
I’ recognised my rooster’s tail and Pollyooly’s
crest twisted into wondrous creations, re-
sembling feather flowers. The drummer
squatted crosslegged on the parade ground,
and the dance shuffled round him as his
fingertips tum-tummed on the skin-topped
kapa. Up and down, down and up they
sidled and shuffled, stamping their feet at
intervals, until one’s senses grew numbed by
the monotonous repetition.
The prisoners from the gaol sallied forth,
and took up their stand in the opposite
corner of the great grass square. They were
mostly men from the Purari Delta. They had
no chance to make feather ornaments, but
they had stripped the croton avenues of gay
branches, and it was a moving forest of red
and gold which took up the dance, led by a
Korai-vagi man directing operations with
Mi-ia’s wing-feather. This way and that
he waved it, and the great phalanx swayed
to his motions.
A party of Goaribari murderers, in leg-
irons, stood mournfully by. They shook
their heads as the Taubada .suggested that
they too should dance. They had no drum,
they said, and they could not dance to other
•drums—Goaribari danjce needed Goaribari
drummer. An empty kerosene-tin was
requisitioned, and a drummer was selected
after much consultation. As he squatted and
drummed he intimated to me that I ought lo
ask the Taubada to let him out of gaol. “It-
is true that I killed a man,” he said, “but I
buried him in the earth like white people
do. I did not eat him like these bushmen.
Why, then, am I in prison?” As I could not
give any satisfaction, I left him taking it
sadly out of his improvised kapa. A Goaribari
is never very gay. He lives in a mud swamp
in a country where rain is the dreary
accompaniment to his daily labors. Rain
and mud, mud and rain, day in, day our.
until the swamp has bred a race as dour and
dreary as itself. The very tom-tom of the
drums has a mournful sound,, quite different
from the lively rattle of other tribes.
From a distance came the sound of a brisk
tattoo, stopping and then drawing nearer. A
hum went round. It was a party expected
from Ogamobu, a plantation up the river. A
gay group fluttered into sight, squatted, and
the drum rat-at-tat-tatted ; again the group
arose and fluttered with mincing steps, and
again dropped to their haunches. In this
fragmentary way they made their debut on to
the parade-ground, where they took up their
stand at some distance from the .other
dancing parties. The visitors Were Kiwais,
accomplished dancers; instead of the appa-
rently aimless shuffle and stamping of the
Purari and Goaribari, they imitated the flight
of birds, the hunting, of pigs, the sowing of
crops, in the expression of emotions not far
behind the Russian ballet-dancer.
All day long the parade-ground vibrated to
the beat of drums and feet. As darkness
fell dancing was forsaken for that most de-
lightful of all Papuan pleasures, eating. When
the ten-o’clock gun announced the end of the
day, every man, woman and child on the
station was lying bellyful and happy.
Duna reported to his Taubada in the morn-
ing, “Everything all right, sir boss, and a
mavaru namoheria ,” which being interpreted
was to the effect that the feast was super-
latively splendid.

If you should go by the road of death.
Or I, with a world between,
Since our tine love is.builtyon faith
And fearlessness serene,
Happy you’d rest by Heaven’s gate,
Not weeping tears, or dumb,
But singing, knowing that soon or late
Most surely I would come.
Or I would wait near the throne of God.
Watching yet \fithout fear.
And you would come where His lilies nod
Some-day in some vague year.

The J.C.W. panto at Melbourne Majesty’s
makes amends for any shortcomings in-last
year’s Christmas Annual, now dimly re-
membered as having been a bit weak some-
where. “Humpty Dumpty,” though hampered
by the silliest of pantomime stories, goes
with a swing. The principals are not too
long on the stage at a time, and the frequent
incursions of shapely girl are a never-fail-
ing delight. One remembers the King’s Body-
guard as a splendid collection of female sub-
jects, who might bring any enemy of the
reigning monarch to his knees by merely
marching past in single file. The gleam of
scarlet-clad chorus to "Way down in Swanee”
is another glad memory, and to think of the
Wedgwood Rotunda is to wonder whether
anything so artistically charming as the six
human VVedgwood figures in the balcony was
ever devised in a pottery. In this scene
Maggie Dickenson figures pleasingly as an
interloper with amorous designs on a china
shepherd; but Maggie appears to have out-
lived some of her girlish elasticity and light-
ness, and is improved only in the art of
making-up. The glad rags and scenic fittings
in some of the other scenes incline to garish-
ness, but they at least are invariably smart,
and where stockings are concerned the con-
tents, as a rule, are beyond criticism.
* * * *
Humpty Dumpty in previous pantos was
an imp, more or less, but in the present
instance he appears as the village idiot,
foisted upon the kind indulgence of a
ridiculous sorceress. This tall and super-
natural lady (Helen Temple) makes an
utterly futile endeavor to place Humpty the
Idiot on the local throne in place of King
Edwin Brett, a harmless monarch who looks
rather like a middle-aged Sam Weller. Ex-
cept that he smacks of livery stable there is
no reason for the sorceress’s down on Brett,
His treasurer (Maurice Dudley) belongs to
the old panto noblesse, and his Queen is a
frugal-minded Dame who spins yarns about
dead-and-buried husbands. However, the)
sorceress is thwarted and the principal boy
rescues the principal girl from the Aurora
Borealis, so the course of mutual affection
ends in a cherry orchard where electric lights
shine from the stone fruit. Beatrice Allen,
as the Boy, has no particular punch in her
style or bite in her singing; yet she is less
undistinguished than Edith Drayson as her
best girl. Albert Le Fre is a highly accept-
able Dame, both in soliloquy and in partner-
ship with Brett; the village idiot has a
pleasing shade of green in his flaxen wig,
and two incidental acrobats —the Lecardo
Brothers—are second to none in their ortho-
dox manner of ’batting. But it seems time
that athletic accomplishments like theirs

and Ugo.
that athletic ac-
complishments like
theirs should be
dissociated from a
kitchen table and
a couple of chairs.
In the matters of
pungent gags and
wheezes, a song
which drags the
kiddies into its
toils, and a gaudy
finale to the first
act, “H umpty
Dumpty” is well
provided for.
“Sinbad the
Sailor” has im-
proved in pictorial
quality since its
last outbreak a t
Melbourne King’s.
This, time Tait,
Bailey and Grant
have had the help
of George Upward
and George Dixon
in the scenic de-
partment, and the
result is a marvel
of fabulous land-
scapes and inte-
riors, harmonising
gracefully with
swaggering f6r e-
grounds of Girl. The damsels are as curved as
usual, if not more so, and the opening scene
—two midgets turning; the pages of a volume
from which step the leading characters of
the plot—is a reminder that the story has
forgotten its traditional absence from the
Though alluring enough in all the picturesque
externals, the ballets behaved a little
show, and is keeping handy for reference,
crudely on Saturday from lack of rehearsal,
but greater ease .and certainty will come
with another week of practice. The humor
already goes on with the old swiftness and
confidence, because the comedians never
have a moment’s doubt that a subtle allusion
to Footscray will double up half the house
in merriment. Yet this year the jesting
gets terribly worn at times, and the revival
of the trick of interruption from the stalls
calls for suppression on account of its length
and antiquity. Jack Cannot is the chief
offender in this obstruction. As Tinbad
the Tailor he gags profusely and sings
alleged songs with a perfunctory cheerful-
ness that merely exalts him at the expense
of the part. Dan Agar is his accomplice
as Dame, and commonplace Daniel simply
demands a red nose to give color to his
character. A grotesque low-comedy counte-
nance is recommended for all Dames that
cannot derive much help from the actor’s
personality.
As principal boy, Jennie Hartley satisfies
all requirements in shapeliness and manner,
but she generally talks her songs, relying on
vaudeville business to make a success of
them. The management has modified its
importing policy to the extent of making a
mere Australian, Sadie Pepper, principal
girl. Sadie justifies the drastic departure by
comporting herself with becoming prettiness
and using her small voice with freshness and
charm. A buxom newcomer, Eleanor Crane,
appears as Prince Hassarac, but her embong-
pong gets in the way of her acting, and her
voice doesn’t bring a rush of superlatives to
the pen. Margot Lester is Pearl of Price,
“Sinbad the Sailor

and, with her
honey soprano and
facial resemblance
to Dot Brunton,
cannot be charged
with libelling the
part. Colin Crane is
a Caliph who has
the leading roar in
the loudest alter-
cation, and Bert
Nicholson is an
Old Man of the
Sea who has a
flourishing growth
of green whiskers.
Hassan’s Cat pre-
serves the points of
the normal roof-
prowler, and Elsie
Parkes is a hefty
dream flitting in
dances with Kelso
Henderson. Ethel
Walker is an ac-
ceptable Fairy
Queen, and Edgeley
and Dawe are two
comedians of eccen-
tric cut. The much-
starred Littlejohns,
who juggle various
glittering imple-
ments whilst bal-
ancing on jewelled globes, would look better
against a plain black background than among
the assembled beauties of the Diamond
Ballet.
Close consideration of the cast of “Chu
Chin Chow” at Melbourne Tivoli is more
flattering to the comedians than to the tra-
gedians of the co. Workman, as Ali Baba,
does his best job in Australia, spite of an
inveterate tendency to excess in gesture and
verbal emphasis. Fantastic frivolity is
expected of him, and he meets the
demand, besides doing his full bit, or more, in
the musical that come his way. He
even chips in pleasantly at the finish of
“Kissing Time,” in which Louie Pounds, as
the fair-fat-and-forty spouse of Ali’s awful
brother, associates the raptures of choice
canoodle with an autumn of full-blown roses
and wine. Gregory Stroud and Winifred
O’Connor also are a complete success in a
series of ornamental poetic light-comedy epi-
sodes. There is warmth of feeling in their
vocalising, music in the_ir studied diction,
and fine pictorial effect in their posing. In
a minor degree Fred Mackay can be com-
mended for his tasteful singing of Omar’s
song, while Graystone earns favorable men-
tion for sundry manly chants. Among the
gloomy people, whose combined efforts after
all go for much less than the comic and sen-
timental relief, Frank Charlton’s melodious
Prayer to Allah is least open to complaint.
Styan, as Abu Hasan, alias Chu Chin Chow,
lacks romantic swagger and subdued ferocity.
He suggests a modern Chinaman rather than
an xirab sheik of ancient story. _ Gerald
Souper is colorlessly morose as Kasim, and
Vera Pearce is only half satisfactory as
Zahrat, the overwrought slave-lady. She
speaks her lines forcibly enough, but being
such an out-size in Veras she needs must
pose ultra-melodramatically in order to get
a striking effect, and one way and another
her impersonation of Bloom of the Desert
is wanting in realism compared with Frank
Cochrane’s cobbler (who stitches Kasim’s
sundered corpse together) or Maggie Moore’s
expansive suggestion of an oily Rebecca in
the second-hand slave-trade.

Melbourne’s panto habit is extending to
the Princess’s this Christmas. The Fullers
have put their money on “Cinderella” as a
likely source of seasonable revenue, and their
version of that trusty fairy tale will be pro-
duced at the Boxing Day matinee on what
is historically known as an unprecedented
scale of magnificence.
“The Boy” at Melbourne Royal is busy
demolishing the
adage that the good
die young. Inciden-
tally, it has suf-
fered further
changes since this
column last men-
tioned it. Maude
Fane has taken a
spell, and Nellie
Payne, whose pre-
vious part has
apparently become
the permanent pro-
perty of Mione
Stewart, has again
got her smile into
hard training in
Maudie’s role. Also

kiss —an American girl clad in a yard or
two of bine fringe—sang “Thank God for

a song, “For You Alone.” And George

Bradley girl in a comedietta.

A rowdy young audience had the run of the
amphitheatre at Melbourne Majesty’s for a
dress-rehearsal of the panto. J.C.W. had
invited the various “homes” and asylums for
boys, and sturdy urchins came in their hun-
dreds to the novel entertainment of free
pantomime the night before the general
public got it. They did love their entertain-
ment. A small girl with flaxen ringlets and
a doll won their special regard early in the
evening, and later on their united heart
went out to a rather older kiddie who had
caught a tiddler w’ith a piece of cotton and
a pin. But most of their tumult was re-
served for the intervals, which they whiled
away in letting off steam. They shouted
from the very fulness of their hearts, and
made a noise for noise’s sake. The grown-
ups present felt that they were getting head-
aches in a good cause, and as those grown-
ups included an army of nurses in uniform
the sufferers were mostly disposed to _ enjoy
the row. When the panto dame, talking as
usual of her dead and gone husbands, said
that No. 2 was a butcher who fed her on
frozen meat and then complained because
the children were frost-bitten, there came a
silvery peal of merriment from the family
circle. Every nurse on the premises was
laughing at the frost-bitten baby notion.
They all took a professional interest in it.

“Don’t Ever Marry” is the injunction on
the programme at Melbourne Majestic this
week. Another matrimonial tangle,
“Neglected Wives,” follows on and gives the
usual movie lesson to the Brute who makes
his missus a cook and sock-darner while he
strays to whisky and billiards at the Club.
Hoyt’s latest appeal is “Tattlers” and ex-
hibits Madlaine Traverse as a heaving
divorcee worried by an adopted husband and
a son of unblemished character. The follow-
ing thriller is an attempt to revive the life
and manners of Bret Harte’s Poker Flat.
The third item is “Buck Jones, the Square
Shooter,” wherein a tenderfoot has a lively
time trying not to be mistaken for a homi-
cidal outlaw. “Trumpet Island” is up at
the Britannia, with an aeroplane playing the
principal part. At the Melba Za Su Pitts
is declaring that “The Heart of Twenty”
is a heart in a million, more or less.

When “The Lilac Domino” had been un-
masked at Sydney Tivoli on Saturday night
the stout and gratified Bob Greig described
it as “the most brilliant production yet
achieved at the Tivoli.” It is certainly
brilliant to the eye and satisfying to the
ear; the taste and fancy of the individual
playgoer will decide whether the superlative
is warranted. At the least, the “Domino’
is evidence of the increasing purpose of
Mclntosh to raise the standard of the Aus-
tralian theatre. It is a brisk and tuneful
show, and not the least important member
of the cast is the scene-painter. There are
the customary interpolations, but they are
not all wrapped in the Stars and Stripes.
Now and then the music gets above musical-
comedy level, and it finds Rene Maxwell
and Jamieson Dodds adequately equipped to
interpret it. Rene’s sinking is impressive
and her acting promising. Dodds employs
a rich baritone mellifluously, and acts with
the ease and sureness that come with long
experience of a part. Moya Chance, an arch
young actress from England, also uplifts
a serviceable soprano, and the chorus and
the orchestra are guilty of rememberable
work. Marie la Varre and Gaston Mervale —
the latter as a wandering musician—give
capital accounts of themselves, and George
Gee, Hugh Steyne, Mel Ward, John de Lacey
and W. Valentine attend to the fun. And
Ivy Shilling is back again, as shapely and as
vital as ever, but wijth a greater sense of
artistic restraint. With A. H. Majilton
she revives the familiar Champagne dance,
whirls through a novel Danse Mexicano, and
charms everyone not incurably jazz-mad with
an Old-World Gavotte.

Bluebeard and his murdered wives have
taken a lease of Sydney Grand Opera House,
and judging by the first-night audience the
harem is going to be one of the popular spots
of Sydney. Bluebeard (Victor Fitzherbert)
has been lying out on the lawn and his beard
has grown a bonzer jade-green. However,
this doesn’t worry the Orangemen in the front
rows very much, as the whiskers only drop
in when the burnt-cork comedian (Harry
Burgess) and the Dame (Jim Gerald) want
a little breathing time. One impressive
moment of the show is when the beheaded
missuses unwind their cerement cloths and
hop it in the manner approved by Gyppo
tapestries. This Mummy dance is one of the
hits of the quaint pot-pourri of ballets and
tuneful-enough songs that accompany Blue-
beard’s ultimate widow (Ray de Vere) and
her lover (Flora Cromer) in their wooing.
There are' incidental happenings, like the
clever balancing feats of Ferry the Frog and
Archie and Gertie Falls. It will all happen
twice daily till further notice.
Stimulated by his successes earlier in the
year, John D. O’Hara revived “Three Wise
Fools” at Sydney Palace on Saturday night.
Sydney Stirling and Frederick Esmelton are
as alluringly idiotic as ever in the roles
respectively of 2nd and 3rd Fools, and the
lovable imbecility of the star as the Ist or
Banker Fool leaves nothing to be desired.
Lizette Parkes is again a most attractive
ward, and Robert Toms makes a worthy
lover. The sentimental Yankee thriller will
run for the next 10 nights.

When “Australia’s

hit this “small” in
the King Country,
Christian blew in
to play for the
show ; but when he
discovered that all
he was wanted for
was to play for a
comedy and then
sit still while M.
P. Adams told his
tale about the film,
he flew off the
handle. “I could
have been planting
onions all the
afternoon,” he said
and stormed out of
the place. Next
day he was re-
quired to rehearse
with a violinist
who was preparing
for a charity con-
cert on the Sun-
da y. H e sent

“Fax” : The “Chu Chin Chow” music is
even better practice for the male soloists
than for the girls. The girls get the sugar-
plums of melody, notably “Any Time is Kiss-
ing Time,” whereas the young men have the
more difficult airs, which make heavier dra-
matic demands on the singers. The Prayer
to Allah that Frank Charlton sings is com-
posed on grand-opera lines, and is so essen-
tially gloomy that a fine voice was indis-
pensable to make it go. Charlton, an Aus-
tralian who had some training in London,
and elsewhere, does great things with his big
musical number, and, in a smaller way,
Gregory Stroud and the cheerful fellow who
sings to his girl in a charming inset scene
are successful with songs that are not of
the cheap, tuneful order. All the singers
work under the difficulty of not being able
to hear the accompaniment distinctly. Placed
under the stage the orchestra is more aud-
ible to the audience than to the actors.
0 “R. 8.”: The newest English films are as
bad as the earlier pictures, and that's saying
a lot. I saw the other day one of the
newest, “The Man Who Forgot”—and he
will be forgotten by everybody as soon as pos-
sible. Indifferent photography is to be
expected of the climate, but the characteristi-
cally English sentimentality, which is merely
mush, has taken all the dignity out of this
corruption of “Enoch Arden.” The scenario
is bad. the principals bad. the story false;
the only good thing in it is the natural act-
ing of seagulls, probably because they were

“Yarra Ben”: They’re making a wel-
ter of it this pantomime season in
Melbourne. Four of them, if we in-
clude “Chu Chin Chow,” which of course
we must. It will be interesting to see how
the old-fashioned productions pan out against
this splendiferous rival. Oscar Asche when
he was here last
remarked ane n t
the comxjarative
failure of his “Mid-
summer Night’s

lia doesn’t want

ence. Anyway, he

don.

“Film Up”: The Federal Government
(bless it!) is not the only one in the world
that wastes money in wild-cat schemes, lhe
British Committee of Public Accounts

“M.P.A.” after a long tour: —
Having hit as many “smalls” in Australasia as the
next showman, I award the palm for the best-
equipped halls and theatres to Maoriland. Take the
larger towns first. Invercargill has its Albion, a
splendidly constructed theatre that would hold its
own in Bourke or Pitt street; Wanganui has its
Majesty’s, a “legitimate,” and Napier its liyric, all
ahead of the theatres of, say, Ballarat, Bendigo and
Geelong by a street, though the Maoriland towns
have only about half the people of these Austra-
lian cities. In little bits of towns like Te Kuiti,
Dannevirke and Milton one finds a couple of shows
going most of the week. Te Kuiti, in the King
Country, has two picture theatres, one an up-to-
date country theatre, running every evening and
pouring in all the film that is released in the
Dominion, with “specials” into the bargain. The
question is how long a limited population can stand
up to this constant stream of Yankee piffle. lhe
principal winners are the blood-and-hair subjects, wit
“The Man They Could Not Hang” leading the van.
But the Carroll Australian productions have a strong
following, and Snowy Baker’s name is a sure draw
these days. “On Our Selection” is another winner.
Yet the show business in M.L. is far below the
standard of 10 years ago. At one time the Windy
Isles were looked upon as a certainty for a high-
grade vocal or talking show, and wonderful figures
have been recorded for concert, lecture and liigh-brow
stuff; but the theatrical manager must needs be
wary to-day. In the old days a comic-opera co. could
play nine months in the Dominion, and there were
far more independent managements on the road, the
principal cities not having then been locked up.
This is the age Of lock-up in “legitimate an.l
picture business alike, J.C.W. holding the leading
theatres of the cities, with the Picture Supply
people scrambling to corner the small-town market.
The N.Z.P.S. is referred to as the “combine,” and
is credited with locking up the whole country from
Auckland to Invercargill. But though it has very
extensive ramifications it has a long way to go
before it will really have the key. It is seveielj
bumped in most of the towns by independent show-
men screening Paramount and Artcraft services, with
a second prop in the Fox productions. The whole
business, especially in the “smalls,” is badly over-
done, and the public won't get the best possible till
numbers of the . “flicker joints” are turned into
motor garages and jam factories. Meantime the
butcher, ■ tailor and other fellows interested are
waking to the fact that they are up to their eyes
in it financially and would like to quit but cannot.
“Ancient Prompter’’: Mione Stewart, who
stepped into Nellie Payne's shoes in “The
Boy” and pleased many connoisseurs of
acting, has been given a lengthy engagement
by the Firm. The young lady with the allur-
ing Christian name is the daughter of
Richard Stewart, who, after a long mum-
ming experience, has looked after the front
of the house at Sydney Majesty’s for several
years.
“Old Pot”: Ethel Warwick (B. 16/12/’2O)
was James McNeil Whistler’s favorite
model in her early days, and she enjoyed
sitting for “the coxcomb who pitched a pot
of paint in the face of the British public.”
She was twice in Australia. First it was
as a member of “The Flag Lieutenant” com-
pany, in, which she had little opportunity ;
but on her second visit she was excellent as
Mrs. Potiphar in “Joseph and his Brethren.”
a character which suited her type of beauty.
This was not her first experience of a Bibli-
cal play, as she had supported Beerbohm
Tree as Herod. Critics have now and then
accused her of not forgetting her model
days, and of posing on the stage, and she
has at least admitted that the thought of it
makes her sometimes self-conscious.
A Melbourne man, Coates, whose name is
associated with living pictures 6f the larger
growth—“ The Kelly Gang,” for instance —is
trying his fist with the rattle-trap type of
comedy so extensively used in Australian
programmes, but hitherto invariably of
American origin. Coates’s comedy, “A Night
Off,” is a comparatively sane item, with
Hughie Stine, of the Tivoli comedians, as
the leading feature —a clubman full of
the spirit of mischief, which is rye whisky.
Other Tivoli people are associated with him
in the hilarious burlesque, which presently
goes on as an item in the Iloyt programme
in Melbourne.
“T.D.M.”: Two actors of entirely dis-
similar type, Cecil Ward and J. B. Athol-
wood, played Napoleon in “A Royal Divorce”
in Sydney. The former, although he gave
a decent performance, was as much like
the real man as either Robert Brough or
Daniel Frawley, who played the -Emperor in
“Madame Sans Gene.” Atholwood, on the con-
trary, dug deep into Napoleonic lore, and
with his dry-as-dust tones —raucous when in
anger—made the part talked about; Julius
Superbus, whose understudy he was, soon
got well and hopped into the cast again.
Atholwood, whose Servilius in the “Cross”
was a study in malignancy, was later pro-
moted to Nero, and played him as though
the tyrant had been nipping pretty con-
tinuously. This was an innovation, but
justified by history, and once more James B.
made a hit. By this time Atholwood was re-
cognised as a great character actor, and,
although his genius has not yet had proper
recognition, he has made a standard, which
others with ambitions have tried to live up
to.
“First Old Man”: Sara Allgood, inter-
viewed in London recently, had a dig at
the much-puffed “producer” of plays. Said
Sara: “Producers are responsible for much
bad acting. Few producers credit the actor
with sufficient intelligence to understand the
character he is to play.” All of which is
perfectly true. Many a good play and many
a good actor have been killed in Australia
by the tribe.
“Nella”: Twenty-five years ago the Jor-
dans, a talented troupe of trapeze artists,
toured Australasia with a topnoteh vaude-
ville .show, which included that slick \ankee
comedian J. J. Burke. The “Flying Jor-
dans” were popular everywhere, and thereby
hangs one of Jack Cosgrove’s oft-told tales.
The Jordans’ advance-agent tried to secure
rooms for his principals at a Newcastle
hotel. “No fear!” said the landlord, “I in
not taking any triatricals.” “But, my dear
man,” remonstrated the agent, “you don t
seem to realise these are the Flying .Tor-
dans !” “Dessay,” said the bung; but I
had the Flving Cosgroves here last week, and
that settled me!” And now, starring with
Wirths’ Circus, is an imported acrobatic
troupe, The Flying Cosgroves!
Of four artists who appeared at an Albert
Hall (London) Sunday concert recently two
were Australians —Stella Power and William
Murdoch. Murdoch, with no deportment or
turn for showmanship to recommend him,
seems to have achieved distinction among
the great host of pianists by the unassuming
sonlfulness of his playing.
“To Bo” : For the real thing, naked and
unashamed. I have seen nothing to equal
the bellerdrarmers produced in the Temper-
ance Hall in Melbourne in the early ’eighties.
In one the blood-and-thunder villain opened
a grave—-stage set as a cemetery—dragged
up a coffin, tumbled out a corpse, and robbed
it with all due trimmings. In another,
“Neck for Neck,” the hero was hanged in
full view of the audience during Act 1, was
cut down in the nick of time by his poor-
but-honest-thank-God servitor, and wandered
around for four more acts with a bit of the
rope sticking out of his coat-pocket. Finally,
in a terrific scene, he grabbed the re-
sponsible miscreant, and for the final cur-
tain we had the real bad man dancing on
nothing, with glaring eyeballs and tongue
well out, while the hero, with a band of red
still around his throat, embraced his per-
secuted lady-love. Then we went out for
lobster-and-porter supper, and afterwards
slept dreamlessly.
“Machete”: I question if “Ruddigore”
will be a success in Australia ; certainly it
wasn’t in England, where I saw it as a

“Peter”: Count Magri, the second husband
of the late Mrs. Tom Thumb, died in Massa-
chusetts (U.S.) last month. Magri, who
was 3ft. lin., was born in Bologna, and just
before his death tried to raise his fare horile
by auctioning his effects, including a midget
piano specially built for his wife; also a
miniature four-poster walnut bed presented
to the pair by P. T. Barnum. The little
Countess, who stood 2ft. Bin., died last year,
aged 79. Pier first, General Tom Thumb,
reached 2ft. Tin., but nothing like her remark-

ago.

wash —or was it paste?
“Audio” : Few outside the profesh under-
stand what a terrible thing it is to be alone
on the stage with nothing to say. I was
doing a patter turn through Maoriland with
a Victor Prince Co-, when the absorbing topic
was Prohibition. -My partner was an excel-
lent improviser so long as he had someone
to gag with. But he often came on the
boards three sheets in the wind. Then he
used to break off in the middle of our dia-
logue and address the audience directly on
pvi]s of Prohibition. I warned him at
last that if he kept it up I would leave him
to it. A few nignts later he started again.
In the middle of the discourse I walked oil.
After the address had lasted a few minutes
he glanced round and discovered that he was
alone. Then first his tongue and next Ins
legs failed him, and falling flat on his back
he received greater applause than our turn
had ever had before. But he has never for-
given me, for all that.
“Hamfat”: Anybody know anything of
Justice Plunkett, “retired Supreme Court
Judge, of Sydney, Australia”? The puff-
paragrapliists in Noo Yoick call him step-
father of Sylvia Bremer, and declare that
he lent dignity to a scene of a picture in
which Sylvia scintillated.
“ J.R.D.” : Melba once lived near Mackay
(Q.)’; her husband, Charles Armstrong, was
managing a sugar-plantation there. She
was billed as Nellie Mitchell when she first
appeared in Sugaropolis, and certain local
“experts” said disparaging things about the
Mitchell" voice. None of us suspected
that an organ that was to be world-famous
was ripening with the sugar-cane.
THE SYNTHETIC EGG.
[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
A doctor of Richmond (Vic.) claims to have in-
vented an artificial egg “so like the original as to
be scarcely identifiable,” which can be manufac-
tured to sell at eightpence a dozen. He says it may
be “employed for all purposes to which eggs were
devoted when eggs were plentiful and cheap.”
I was an actor years ago,
When eggs were cheap and thrown with skill.
I often had my marks to show,
And here I am an actor still.
I take this egg of artifice,
And sitting here I meditate:
Maybe so small a thing as this
May yet uplift the mummer’s state—
He has been spoiled o’er much of late.
’Tis well, I hold, for actors proud
To bend at times beneath the yolk.
They grow too fierce, and high, ’ and loud ;
The people’s spleen they do provoke.
Yet 1 have known as small a thing
As this to pull the proudest down.
He’s modest to whose ringlets cling
The stains that harden into brown,
The mute reproof, the mug’s renown.
The egg makes richer far a cake;
And if he be an actor ’twill
Improve his texture an he take
It in the proper spirit still.
(Which minds me now of rum and eggs,
A nourishment we like full well.)
There is a style of acting begs
The liens’ rebuke, a bursting shell,
The dire conceit of it to quell.
The blown young actor nowadays
Is never knocked from off his pegs.
My Hamlet oft has won high praise—
Much that I am I owe to eggs.
And these cheap things will serve the turn,
To discipline the youth, I guess,
And have that fellow quick to learn
Whose faults are written on his dress
By critics of the yellow press.

NOTIONS
"ON TOP" WITH
MICK SIMMONS
SURE CATCH TACKLE
When Australia went in to bat at Sydney
Cricket Ground on Friday a big score seemed certain.
The day was fine, .the light good, and the wicket perfect.
But the tremendousness of the occasion overwhelmed
the performers: in plain language they had cold feet.
Against bowling which was never more than average
good length stuff the pride and hope of thousands
faded into ineptitude. Taylor and Pellew were
the only batsmen who faced the attack in the proper
care-free spirit. They made 34 and 36 respectively
by bright, game cricket. Collins and Macartney
bore no resemblance to the men who caused the
Englishmen to look so cheap in the N. S. Wales
match, though the former managed to scratch to-
gether a hadly-needed 70. The innings closed early
on Saturday for 267.
If the initial Australian batting display was poor
that of England was abject. Hobbs alone showed
enterprise, but just as he was fairly set Armstrong
tempted him and he fell. The wily Victorian took
most of the fieldsmen away from the on side and
Hobbs began pulling and placing Gregory’s expresses
through the open gate. Inevitably he missed one
after a time, and that was his finish. Woolley (52)
and Ilendren (28) made something of a stand. Then
Woolley drove one high to the off and Mailey accom-
plished a wonderful catch, and a few minutes later
Hendren skied a perfect gift—which Gregory took
smiling. After that the visitors collapsed. Total
190.
The dulness of the batting on both sides was
partly explained and almost redeemed by the field-
ing. Australia excelled in the latter department on the
whole, but it was a close thing. Pellew at cover,
Bardsley and Taylor in the outfield and Gregory in
the slips saved scores of runs with classic finish, and
Oldfield performed brilliantly behind the sticks even
if he did give Douglas a life that Carter would
certainly have taken. The Englishmen showed up
as a more level lot in this respect. Not even Hobbs
was noticeably more effective than half a dozen Aus-
tralians who might be mentioned: on the other hand
there was no one in the English team so ponder-
ously languid as Armstrong. While Mailey kept
his length he was. unplayable, his half-foot breaks
giving anguish to all but Hobbs. Armstrong kept
him on practically throughout the innings, and if
all the chances given off him had been accepted he
would have emerged with a great average. The
skipper made peculiar use of his bowlers, by the
way. Kelleway sent them down in great style after
dismissing Russell, but was taken off; and Arm-
strong, after contributing one over from which only
two were scored, returned the ball to Mailey. The
latter move was understandable: Douglas, who suffers
from Mailey-shock, had come in. But it was strange
that Kelleway shouldn’t have been given another fly.
Australia did much better in' its second venture.
But as the bowling was on the spot and the field
well-placed and keen, runs came at about the pace
of a well-conducted funeral. Macartney did threaten
to sparkle, but after being given a life by Strudwick
(who thought the ball had hit the wicket) he re-
lapsed. Collins made his century by cricket as
correct as a young-ladies’ seminary, and Bardsley
(57) crashed at the first real chance he took. He
jumped out to Hearne and mistimed the hall, after
a display that contained some peerless ground strokes
past cover and through the slips. Taylor’s was per-
haps the brightest effort, though he compared un-
favorably at times for enterprise with the strangely
unpopular Kelleway. Woolley worked hard for his
only wicket —Pellew l.b.w. A doubtful decision this,
by the way. How can a batsman be l.b.w. to a left-
hander bowling right round the wicket as Woolley
does ?
It quickly became evident on Tuesday that the zip
had gone out of the bowling and that the fieldsmen,
though they continued to play the game like sports-
men, had lost heart. Before the afternoon was half-
through the visitors had been set some 600 runs to
win, with several of Australia’s best bats to come.
By evening the interest in the great event had died
to vanishing point.

There were some bright performances in
Melbourne district cricket on Saturday. Melbourne
in response to ’Wood’s 234 made 374 for 6, thus
winning by 4 wickets and 140 runs. The hero of
the game was the Melbourne bat, Sandford, who
knocked up 151, including five 6’s and 19 4s. He
hit 27, including three 6’s, in one over. Ransford
showed also a revival of form with a perfect 93.
P’ran, who closed with 3 for 329, had the happiness
of inflicting an innings defeat on Richmond. Rich-
mond scored 130 and 43. Grimmett and Lampard,
of P’ran, hurried the procession to the pavilion—B
for 61 and 7 for 59. Another great bowling per-
formance was Finch’s 8 for 66 for ’Cote against
’Roy. Yet 'Roy got the verdict by 25. South,
who had opened badly with 2 for 4, were only 36
behind Essendon’s total of 261, with four wickets
still to fall,' at the call of time; so the game was
drawn. Carlton’s 97 gave them a win by 34 over
North on the first innings. North, making 6 for 117
in their second try, closed about an hour before time
with the wild idea of dismissing Carlton and saving
a defeat on the first hits. But the scheme didn’t
work. Carlton finished with 3 for 45. St. Kilda,
who totalled 289 (Ferguson 87 and T. Horan 62)
were 70 too many for East, whose liveliest bat was
Maynard (69 n. 0.).
* * * *
Governor Weigall has formed a Govern-
ment House cricket team in Adelaide, and has
already played matches with the military, the police
and various city councils. Clem Hill is a member.
His Ex. proves to be a sound bat and a change
bowler. His private sec., Legh Winser, wicket-
keeper for the State, took five wickets for 31 in one
of these games. Somerset, A.D.C., is the other star
of the staff—a fair “keep” and a better bat.
* * * *
N. S. Wales team to make the southern
trip comprises nine of the XI which overwhelmed
South Aus. (Punch and O’Keefe are omjtted). The
team has two wicket-keepers (Oldfield and Carter),
and the inclusion of a young bowler would have been
better. Victoria’s XI will be chosen from a dozen
who have already played in Sheffield Shield matches
this season and F. Yeomans. The selectors on neither
side care to experiment with the Shield in the bal-
ance ; yet there are not many reasons why they
shouldn’t.

This page’s view that the £l5OO attached
to the A.J.C. Villiers mile would be appropriated by
one of the rough division proved Correct. When the
Maoriland-bred mare Fluency, from Booth’s estab-
lishment at Rosehill, fled home half a length ahead of
fast-finishing old Cetigne, the fielders cheered. Few
of them had written her name. Early in the morn-
ing 100’s to 3 were on offer, with no takers. Later
a few hundreds were taken from one or two of the
bigger men, and she closed at 100 to 6. It was a
great betting race, and at the last 8 to 1 the field
and 10 to 1 bar three were on tap, with Cetigne,
King’s Word and Westinere in greatest demand and
much support forthcoming for All Aboard, Prince
Viridis and Wish Wynne. Cetigne and King’s Word
had been shorter than this before the marbles were
drawn. They lifted a couple of points when the
hoisting of the numbers showed them to be on the
outer wing at the barrier.
The winner is by Demosthenes. She was given as
a present to O. R. Falkiner when a yearling by her
breeder Gerald Stead, and was recently bought by
Percy Miller. She ran well up in the Epsom, but
it was supposed by her trainer and owner that she
would do better over a distance, and she has been
backed confidently at 10 furlongs. She won in really
good style, though Cetigne had all the worst of the
luck. He had a bad trip to the straight, and when
they struck the turn was 10 horses back. Also he

was jambed opposite the Leger, and it was not until
the last half-furlong that Wood got a clear run.
Then the way the ancient forged ahead was astonish-
ing, and if the race had been a few strides longer he
must have won. The mare, hanging on well in the
middle of the course, ran the mile in “37J.” King’s
Word had every chance. He was in the first flight
all the way to the seven pole and there drew out on
his own, but began to tire over the last bit. Wish
Wynne a was with him for seven, and there fulfilled
expectation by blowing up.
Richmond Main’s fine-looking two-year-old black
brother Pelaw Main was given a first run in the
A.J.O. December Stakes on Saturday. In a field of
28, which included several fatigued youngsters that
had been racing since October, he was backed down
to 3to 1, with Carlita’s daughter Linita at s’s. He
shaped well, but was licked a furlong from home;
and as one after another of the leaders punctured,
C. S. McPhillamy’s filly Edina streamed through
and won by a length from one of the Thompsons’
Buckwheats—Bran Pie, a half-sister to Eurythmic.
Edina was the best-grown juvenile on the ground. A
week before she ran unplaced at an up-country meet-
ing. The few people who specked her on the
machine drew odds at the rate of 83 to I—includingl—including
a Newcastle punter who had been handed 20 Edina
tickets for a tenner by mistake, and after publicly
wailing about his bad luck rushed back to the
machine and drew £835.
Booster’s win with Bst. 101 b. in the Holiday
Handicap on Saturday gives him a pleasing appear-
ance with 71b. less in the Summer Cup on Boxing
Day. But there are others in the picture. Old
Lingle, carrying Bst. 111 b., was galloping better
than Booster at the end of the Holiday, and had he
commenced moving in earnest sooner would have
seriously troubled the winner. Whether he can do
well over a longer distance with less weight is one
of the principal problems of the Cup. Braille, who
has been running well over short courses lately,
appears in good health, and as he can certainly stay
the Cup distance he may be troublesome.

Adelaide has taken a lead set by Perth
and started to run trotting meetings at night under
electric light. The sport in Perth flourishes, and
judging by the attendance is more popular than the
gallops. Certainly the course is only 10 minutes’
tram ride from the city, and that and the electri-
cally-worked totalise tor account for a lot of the
patronage. About £600 is
distributed every Saturday
night in prize money, and
the W.A.T.A. is in a good
way financially—so good,
in fact, that it is now re-
claiming a swamp on the
Swan banks at a cost of
£40,000 for a new track.
Incidentally, the associa-
tion last year distributed
£8000 among charities,
and on a recent Satur-
day night gave the
whole of the profit
—about £850 — to
the Maimed and Limb-
less Soldiers’ Assoc.

The Port Adelaide races were held on
Saturday, and the event most likely to throw some
light on the Port Adelaide Cup (lsm.), to be
run on Boxing Day, was the Lansdowne Stakes (lin.
3f., w.f.a.). This went unexpectedly to Paratoo,
who beat Dependence a head, with Crusader in front
of five others. As the winner unloads 151 b. in the
Cup (he ran second last year with 7st. 21b.), what
chance have the other two with 51b. up and 71b.
down? As three-year-Qlds, there was not much
to choose between Lord Setay (top weight with
9st. 61b. in the Cup) and Crusader, but now the St.
Anton horse is rated nearly a stone better, and looks
like carrying his big weight home in front. Colbert,
over from Victoria, must have a look in with Bst.
61b., as he ran a close Second to Paratoo last March
in the V.R.C. Autumn Handicap (lm. 5f.), giving
the Pistol horse 201 b. In the Cup he is giving away
only 41b. The unusual Ibex stayer Chamois is the
best of the others.

The melancholy story of what happened to
Bert Spargo at Syuney Stadium on Saturday night
is soon told. For 16 rounds he gave Eugene
Criqui a boxing lesson. The frequency with which
he hit the foreigner was as remarkable as the con-
sistency with which the latter missed him. On every
side prosperous-looking men breathed stertorously
through arched noses in a manner indicative of
anxiety, for the Ring had freely laid four to one
on Criqui during the afternoon. Then Criqui hit
Spargo on the ear. Gore dominated the proceed-
ings: the smitten boxer slowed down. Coolly watch-
ing his chance Criqui landed a terrific right on
the Melbourneite’s jaw. Spargo took nine and then
with misguided bravery struggled up and went on
fighting. Another crash on the point and he went
down again. Only blind instinct kept him erect,
and more or less on the defensive. It was the epic
courage of the lone bulldog-ant facing a couple of
small boys. Regretfully Criqui knocked him clean
through the ropes witfi a wallop on his shattered
ear and was crowned victor, at the same moment as
a large glass object hurtled into the ring and
smashed beneath the startled countenance of the
S. M. Herald representative, and a patron of the
£1 seats had a fit. This business of bombarding
the ring with glassware seems to be developing into
a habit, by the way, and calls for drastic police
action. The Governor-General and both Test teams
watched the fight.
* * * *
It was a preliminary fight in a Melbourne
hall, a very one-sided affair, in which “Pompey”
Smith, the discolored lightweight champ, of Cres-
wick, was receiver-general, taking a bitter gruelling
at the hands of “Handy” Hendy, of Prahran. Pompey
was easily beaten, but hard to induce to admit it,
and he kept going round after round, till in the
eighth he was put down three times; in fact, almost
as soon as he arose he was floored again. Scrambling
to his feet, he warded his foe off with an extended
glove. “Hold hard, boss,” he said. “Hold hard a
minute.” Then, addressing the audience: “Gennle-
men,” lie said, “I perpose dat we refer dis yer dis-
pute to arbitration.” Then he fell down again.
After that for a long time the popular local gibe
when a mill was going too slowly was, “Oh, arbi-
trate, arbitrage!” *
Jack Dempsey’s latest contest with Bill
Brennan makes him look less of a destroyer than
he has appeared at any time since he belted the
championship out of Jess Willard. Brennan, who
was born in Co. Mayo, Ireland, in 1893, is a fast
and rugged customer who had previously given the
champion trouble. At Milwaukee early in 1918
he bashed Dempsey severely for seven rounds, and
was not seriously disturbed himself, but had to
chuck it with a broken ankle. Last week he made
the champion go all out for 12 rounds. The occur-
rence is likely to make the people who have insured
Carpentier’s life sleep easier than they have done for
months.

Since Briggs, Howard and De Garis headed
west in their De Haviland 4 they have put behind
close on 6000 air-miles. Last week they came over
from Perth to Sydney in two days, the actual flying
time for the 2431 miles being 214 hours. Next
morning the adventurous trio went on to Melbourne,
their starting point.

The English Lawn Tennis Assoc, has
raised a howl of protest by proposing to amend
the service rule. The idea is to direct the player
that he must shoot from behind the base-line with
both feet down, or if one foot is lifted it must
come to earth behind base. The Australian and
American Assocs. are not likely to adopt the sug-
gested practice, which would bring their net-rushers
to a comparative standstill on the rear line, and
the French and other foreign bodies are likely to
vote with Australia and the U.S. on the matter.
It is certain that the British Assoc, cannot bring
the new rule into force without some strenuous
opposition even among its own members. R ings-
cote, for instance, the best ranking player in
England, would hate to be banished to the back
country.

The most successful craft among the open
boats on Sydney Harbor this season is the old 22-
footer champion Irex, sailed by A. J. Pitt. She
was built by the famous Joe Donnelly to the order
of Nick Johnstone in the early ’nineties, and after
a brilliant career among the cracks of the day was
taken by Mark Foy to England, where Mrs. Wylie
Sailed her against The Maid of Kent. The Maid won.
Irex has started in eight races this season and
won five times, finished second twice, and fourth
once. ,

Sydney Amateurs’ Ocean Race occurred
last Saturday. The fleet got away in a light nor’-
easter. Waitangi (7min.) put up a great go to the
Heads. Triton and Seabird, off the honor mark, were
well among the limit boats before they got outside.
The ocean mark, which according to schedule should
have been three miles to windward of South Reef,
was laid so far south that all heavy sailing was cut
out. Waitangi revelled in the light stuff and was
never headed, crossing the line with a lead of 2|min.
from Seabird (her first wi« this season, by the way),
with Don Taylor’s consistent Triton lOsec. away
third.

The first 16-foot skiff championship sailed
under the management of the newly-formed N.iS.W. State
Skiff Council was decided over the Parramatta
River-Balmain course on Saturday, 32 boats facing
the starter. Daph, piloted by W. Moncrieff, of the
Port Hunter Club, had a runaway win, finishing
slmin. ahead of the Botany representative, St.
George (W. Hayward).
• * * •
Moyana (Wal Keddie) put up a good
performance in the Sydney Sailing Club’s 18-footer
Handicap on Saturday. In the first heat she lobbed
heme under all available drapery with 14min. to
spare from Tom Tait. in Rocket. In the "final she
got away second, quickly headed Rocket, and squared
for the run to Shark Island ljmin. in advance of
Kismet (W. J. Duncan). Keddie’s charge lumped the
wind along with her at this stage, the rest of the
fleet getting hung up under Steel Point, and she
won by smin. from Kismet.
Gladstone Park's defeat of Balmain by 50
points (163 —113) landed the John Young Bowling
Shield at Sydney on Saturday. Chatswood, which
defeated Kuringai by 179—138, had the next best
return. Although Test match and big race-meeting
took away a lot of regulars, 22 clubs “rolled up”
for the trophy, which keeps green the memory of
the G.O.M. among Australian bowlers.

Billy Fogwell again holds the Maoriland
sculling championship. He was billed for a return
match with champion Paddy Hannan, but the latter,
after holding the title for only three weeks, was
compelled to forfeit owing to illness. Fogwell had
notified that it was his last sculling race; and
retirement will make the way plainer for Billy
McDevitt and Dick Arnst, who are challenging for
the championship.

“Old Sport”: Although J. R. Hooper won
his first heat in the English amateur billiards
championship, defeating Christey by 1006 points in
their game of 2000 up, the Australasian amateur
champion felt the effects of his lack of practice. This
was apparent as the game proceeded. In the first
500 Hooper outclassed his opponent, scoring 500
to Christey’s 130. Christey did slightly better in
the second session, and the game was called: Hooper
1001 ; Christey 272. In the first Hooper made breaks
of 79, 78, and 63, and in the second 86, 88, 79 and
78. After that he fell away, and in the second
thousand put up four decent breaks, 49, 58, 56 and
33. Christey improved out of sight in the second
thousand, scoring 722 to Hooper’s 999. The next
heat will be played in February, so that Hooper will
have plenty of time for practice on Peall’s private
table. This will be Hooper’s last championship
appearance, as his eyes are failing, and he is obliged,
as in Australia, to w r ear a shade over them. His play
is greatly admired in London, and he is regarded
as having performed up to his reputation as “the
most finished amateur in the world” —John Roberts’s
description of him.

Maoriland Gov.-Gen. Jellicoe is caught in
the sport whirl. He regularly plays cricket, and is
an enthusiastic motorist. He has just gone into
residence at Auckland for three months, and will
attend the Davis Cup carnival and the A.R.C. meet-
ing at Ellerslie. His taste for sea-salt is ministered .
to by a 14ft. (open) sailing boat, which he will sail
on Auckland harbor.
THE PREVAILING MADNESS.
[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
While walkihg on my cherished lawn,
And counting roses where they blow,
This morning shortly after dawn
A leather missile laid me lo\y.
It blackened up my dexter eye,
And put my Roman nose awry.
It was a neighbor showing Bcgg
How Armstrong pulls a ball to leg,-
Last night as we at dinner sat
A something in the gravy lit,
Bounced out and struck a butter pat,
And splashed the pastor’s coat with it.
I learned that Brown across the way
Was showing Smith a bit of play
Worked by Macartney when he shore
“A beaut.” past cover point for four.
One morn while- we were yet a-bed
A globule through the window came,
And cracked my missus o’er the head,
And hit a-" glass, and broke the same—
A pier-glass this worth many pounds.
Mogg makes apologetic sounds:
He was expounding with a stake
How Tozer beats the bowlers’ break.
It comes to this, that in the street
Or in the home one is not safe,
For everywhere you’re like to meet
A staid old gent or city waif,
With sticks and stones describing how
The fashion is to snick ’em now.
And this explains why I betimes
Sit in the cellar writing rhymes!
VICTORIA.

Already the new title is tripping from
the lips of the Very Naicest as if they had
been practising it before going to sleep.
“Viscount Novar!” Certainly, it is not
such a mouthful as “Sir Ronald Munro
Ferguson,” and will take up less space.
Evra Scot knew he would mak’ a guid selec-
tion, and they all think it sounds gran’.
St. James’s, Melbourne’s old cathedral,
had a Christmas fete on December 13 and
14. Lady Forster was there and was much
interested in the building. The first Sun-
day after her arrival in Melbourne she took
her lord to this church, and they sat in the
pew that used to be devoted to the Governor
and his lady in early days. There are still
people about who were connected with the
fane in the early ’sixties. Two' of these
came to the fete and showed Lady Forster
awards they had won at St. James’s Sun-
day-school in their youth. One was
treasuring a prize she bagged in 1870, and
her husband has a book five years' older
than that.
Dr. Charlie Lempriere’s old home in
Toorak-road has been bought by the Lady
Helen Club for Blind Soldiers. (No need
.yet to ask whence it gets its name.) Lady
Forster opened the cosy place last week.
Blind soldiers, who acted as hosts, had typed
the invitations and been busy with much
preparation. Mrs. Rudd, who owned the
house after Dr. Lempriere, gave all the
carpets. Several Red Cross branches helped
with donations. The Maryborough R.C.
gave £5OO. The Home Hospitals Committee
(Admiral Creswell’s wife is president) saw
to the furnishing, renovation and equipment,
helped greatly therein by Mrs. Frazer, of
whose devoted service to the blind Lady
Forster spoke in her little speech. Rodgers,
M.H.R., led the procession to view the
place; and John Grice, the Mitchell and
Miller dames, Dr. Charlie Bage, Miss
Robertson. Mrs. Hewison, Dr. Barrett and
his Wife, the Archie Curries and Mrs. Cherry
were in the party. And Miss Day, of St.
Dunstan’s, London.
A Melbourne man who was in Ottawa
lately gives an almost pathetic account of
our old friend Lord Dicky Nevill. At some
open-air function the visitor noticed, among
the vice-regal party, a stout and sorrowful-
looking elderly man who was walking with
two sticks. The cripple’s face suggested
slim and upright Lord Richard of the out-
standing ears, but the change of figure, per-
suaded him that the resemblance was - only
accidental. Two or three inquiries among
bystanders left him no wiser than before as
to the identity of the elderly johnnie with
two sticks, but a paragraph in the evening
paper informed him tha_t Lord Richard Nevill
had been among his Excellency’s staff
at the function. The sad elderly gentleman
who had put on so much flesh since he left
Australia was gentle Dick. He had broken
both his legs the previous winter through a
fall on th-e footpath while venturing abroad
without putting rubbers over his boots.
There is still no match-making environ-
ment like a mail steamer. The Orvieto
brought to Fremantle on its last trip the
Bishop of Kalgoorlie, who used to be a
Bush Brother. Another passenger Avas
Cecilia McLean, a pretty Perth girl, whose
father was a Westralian- squatter. The in-
teresting pair had never met in the West,
but during the voyage the Bishop made such
progress—he is unmarried and still young
enough to be impressionable—that at the epd
of the journey it was announced that Cissie
would be the future Mrs. Kalgoorlie.
“Chu Chin Chow,” at the Tivoli, does not
confine its gorgeousness to the stage. The
wdiole theatre is wrapped in Oriental dress
and steeped in incense. Big, squat, bronze
urns sit, about the corridors to delight the
romantic and give nervy people headaches.
The lounges, which have been upholstered in
dead black to hit up the gay colors of walls
and rugs, recall old-time opera nights, so
many of the Quality stroll out in a fussy
frocked way for a breath of air and frivolous
chatter.
Vera Pearce is so heavily veiled that there
is none of her visible except massive bare
arms and bare feet. The henna-tipped fingers
and toes are starting a rage. Sassiety girls
do not yet show their toes, but manicured
fingers are steeped in pink to the first joint.
You might almost think they had been use-
fully employed making the family’s raspberry
jam.
The dresses in the King's panto of “Sin-
bad the Sailor” are. as usual, the work of
Rainbow and Borealis, though there is less
insistence this year on sweltering reds and
washing-day blues. Not that scarlet and
blue are banished from the production. There
is a trail of red-legged sailors on the decks
of the Saucy Sherbet, and a sky-blue
quartette in the ballet of the Diamond Val-
ley is a biff in the eye that the adjoining
confections fail to soothe. Elsewhere the
colors run to dainty pink, pale green, biscuit
and cream, and there is a handsome body-
guard of bobbed divinities revealing white
tunics and slim black legs attending Margot
Lester in one of her tunes. .Jennie Hartley
changes her tights- pretty often, and her dark
brunette complexion allows her to wear the
most audible shades w’ithout a shudder.
Eleanor Crane looks an out-size in one fine
goldeny tunic with maroon legs, and the
grey suit with lavender facings also enhances
her place in the picture. Sadie Pepper has
fragile garments of golden tissue and yieux
rose, but the most ornate dresser of the lot
is her impressive stage-dad, Colin Crane. As
the Caliph he is the beau of a shady prin-
cipality. Gold and scarlet turbans, coats
of glittering silk, with expensive belts to
match, suggest that there is a buzz in the
rag market when he goes shopping.
Mrs. Vale, who glided out last week, was
the widow of “R.T.,” who, after a long
innings in the Assembly and on the execu-
tive of the L.0.L., was in the first Turner
Government. Latterly he fell on hard times,
and Murray, Watt and Peacock made a small
job for him as librarian of the Geological
Museum. Mrs. Vale was a quiet body, who
never obtruded herself while “R.T.” was in
public life. She held on to Ballarat till the
end.
Walter Kirby was wounded in his tenderest
top-note by the whisper that he had announced
a farewell song recital previous to the >ne he
gave the other week. Walter furnished a song
recital in November last year at the Prin-
cess’s Theatre, but it was not disguised as a
farewell function. It was just an annual
outbreak in which the sugary tenor had the
support of vice-regal and other artists.
Lawyer F. T. Ilickford has been given a
third term as Grand Master of the Vic.
Masons. Latterly there has not been much
competition for the job: the last tussle was
when Carty Salmon fought for it. But if
Earl Stradbroke can be roped in. another
boom in Victorian Masonry is expected.
Captain Fred Jolley is a young Australian
member of the Expropriation Board at
liabaul. British Consul at Rabaul when the
war started, he was
taken charge of by
the Germans and
was missing for many
months. After his
rescue he went into
the fight in France
and was there until
wounds put him out
of action. His later
war work was as
military secretary to
the Governor of New
Britain.
Jolley has had ex-
tensive experience in
the Islands. For many
years he was secre-
tary and accountant
to the Samoan Queen
Emma. Emma in-
stituted a large trading-store which was
linked up With numerous cocoanut-copra
plantations. Jolly also had a plantation,
and for a long time was the only Britisher
owning such a thing in the then-German
territory. He succeeded Forsyth as British
Consul. (Forsyth was Queen Emma’s fifth,
or so, husband.) _ The big trading store
known as “Forsyth’s” was taken over by a
syndicate of Germans, and this is oiie of the
businesses now handled by the Expropria-
tion Board with a view to the “liquidation”
provided for by the Treaty of Versailles*
Jolley is a son of Mrs. Marsh, of Melbourne,
and a grandson of Reidy, a. prison governor
of old V.D.L. days, and a younger
brother has charge of his plantations in
New Britain.
The brainy Brennan family was much in
evidence at last week-end. Tom, who is now
virtually leader of the Criminal Bar, was
engaged putting up a defence for the younger
Pierce with such effect that the jury dis-
agreed. (It was evident that the methods of
Dan O’Connell in Ireland and R. D. Ireland
in Vic. had been well studied by Tom.)
Willie, just returned from U.S.A.. blended
humor and satire in telling in the Argus
how Brother Jonathan does things. Sister
Anna, who helps Frank to run his legal
business, displayed an exquisite (and un-
cattish) touch that Willie might have envied
in an article in the same journal on femi-
nine powdering and painting. Harry, who
now leads the law-court staff for the Argus,
found work none the less pleasant because
Tom (formerly a sub on the same paper)
was making such readable copy.
Mary Laing-Meason, after flitting around
Melbourne for a few weeks, is off by the
Orontes with China in view. The Philip
Waring Dramatic Co. wants her for busi-
ness manager in a tour through India. China
and Japan, and though India and Japan
are places she already knows, the China
portion of the tour was an irresistible attrac-
tion. Of all the interesting women one meets
who have seen the world and played many
parts Laing-Meason is surely the most
gently pertinacious and unobtrusively effec-
tive. Were she about to fly to the North
Pole she would announce the fact in a
whisper, diffidently confessing that the Pole
was a place she had always wanted to see.
Here is a picture of pianiste Louise Gar-
gurevich, who recently gave a successful
pianoforte recital which reaped her some fine
comments. The youngest of a family of
seven Australians,
Miss Gargurevich
early struck out for
herself and began by
winning several gold
medals from the
A.N.A. A scholar-
ship awarded at the
Marshall Hall Con-
servatorium was her
next achievement.
Over-study, whi c h
resulted in a tem-
porary collapse of
her hands, compelled
her to forsake plat-
form work at the
time for teaching.
Having taken her
L.A.8., the persis-
tent little artiste
stuck to her piano and pupils with notable
success, and she takes special pride in hav-
ing trained Dorothy Randle from the mature
age of six. Miss Gargurevich, an enthusiast
of high degree, longs now for a feast of
the music that Europe can supply.
Though the Firm hasn't been lavish with
the “Huinpty Dumpty” dressing, some of
its effects are very taking. Perhaps nothing
so captures the eye as a platoon of bare-
backed blondes that rises out of the darkness
to disclose brilliant semi-transparent skirts
decorated with scarlet roses. And a red-and-
black serpent glides to one of the principals’
warbling of a trail nigger melody. But the
prevailing tone of the girls is yellow in all
its luscious gradations, from rich orange to
underdone canary. Ilumpty’s dashing army,
with breastplates and helmets in the shape of
bisected hen-eggs, and wearing uniforms in
the color known to painters as cadmium, is
an exouisite conception. Various young
dreams have clusters of golden grapes clinging
to strange orange skirts that have borrowed
their lines from a corkscrew seen by a bag-
man at a smoke-night, and there is another
group of sweet young lemons who have a
slice of the fruit for a demented hat that
seems to be slipping from its moorings.
Plump Beatrice Allen bursts on the view
in a grey tunic and tights with vehement
green boots. Also she is further adorned
in pink, white, pale saffron and black jet,
and easily feels every corner of her garments.
Edith Drayson is mostly confined to sub-
marine tints, and Maggie Dickinson’s bright-
est frock is a roomy, panniered skirt in
pink with white fur-edging, from which she
sprouts timidly in an immaterial bodice.
Sidney Culver, formerly Yates, leaps about
as an embarrassed grasshopper, and, barring
a massive final confection wherein a hat-
bow like a windmill reminds one in its color
of early cherries, Dame Albert Le Fre
seems responsible for the shortage of corn-
sacks.
A. F. Parker, who is to remain undis-
turbed as member for P’ran till July next,
when the petition challenging his right to
sit will be heard, was married last week,
and got a wedding gift from his Labor col-
leagues.
The tea-rooms buzzed the other day about
the alleged engagement of a widowed Digger
General of high degree. There may be a
widowed General who contemplates re-mar-
riage; but the most intimate friends of the
widowed General of the very highest degree
are positive that the rumor doesn’t apply
to him. In fact, he has said so himself.
Mrs. Moulden, Adelaide’s mayoress, floated
into Melbourne last week between dust-
storm and deluge to snatch away a trio of
her liaekett girls from the Geelong Seminary
for the Long or Mince-pie vacation.
Gretchen Leschkau, who hangs out her
sign at Temple Court, all among the lawyers,
is turning the festive season to business
account, as she did last. Christmas. Her
little studio is crowded with an exhibition
of water-color drawings and art leather-
work. The intending purchaser of a leather
bag may happen to fall victim to the lure
of a landscape, and vice versa.
Slim and rather out of the ordinary
Heather Keep, the only girleen of the Witch-
wood Ernest Keeps, is showing a ringed
finger. The lucky man is Major Gordon
Johnstone, M.C., a late A.1.F.-er, a good sol-
dier and cricketer to boot. The Keeps have
loads of luscious china and pictures, so Miss
Heather’s walls need not fear a decollete
appearance 1 to start with.
Mrs. Wittenoom, of Perth, who has been
sojourning in Melbourne, takes daughter
Irene to Java this week by the Houtman.
Her'knight is left in W.A. to keep the home
lires burning. Irene Wittenoom has in-
terested herself in eurhythmies—the art or
craze or cult of graceful bodily movement to
the accompaniment of music.
Mrs. Robertson, who was a Winter-living,
hostessed an afternoon-tea festival at Men-
zies’ on Friday, to welcome back her
widowed sister, Baroness Von Oinpteda.
Many friendly women who lost fine young
Australian sons in the great struggle wish
the widow would drop her German title.
Little Miss Oinpteda. who is 10 or there-
abouts, won’t find even the name an easy
one to/ hand out to patriotic schoolfellows.
Queen's College, within the University, had
a jollification last week. They are begin-
ning the building of a new wing and a
tower. These were in the original design of
Queen’s, but funds were short; now a dona-
tion by Mr. .T. T. Tweddle and a bequest
from the late George Sweet have made
finances easier. George Sweet’s daughter,
Dr. Georgiana, laid the foundation-stone of
the new North Block, and Mr. Tweddle did
the same masonry work for the tower —to
be called Sugden after the popular master
of Queen's. Dr. Sugden refused to take all
the glory of the success of the college. The
matron (Miss Finlay) and her sister must
share it, he insisted : and so must the cook
—a rare specimen of devotion who has been
feeding Queen’s body for nearly as long as
Sugden has been ministering to its mind.
University importants from other corners
inside the ’Varsity fence came to the party.
Dr. and Mrs. Gilruth, Prof. Woodruff, Prof,
and Mrs. Payne, the Swinburnes, Mrs.
Rigley and Dr. Gault were among them.
The Brighton folk ran a little fete all to
themselves last week for the local Life
Saving Club and the Readaptation Fund.
They roped in the beach end of North-road,
and draped the festive scene with vari-colored
electric lights. Though it was an unpreten-
tious little show, the organisers raked in half
a thousand.
Adelaide finds things dull: —
School “speech-days” and picnic cricket are the
beginning and end of the vice-regal programme.
Within a week a Government House team has met
and defeated Parliament, District Headquarters and
the Commonwealth Bank —a record which isn’t to be
wondered at, as his Ex. has Clem Hill and Winser
in his team and both his Aides are keen players.
“Speech-days” included that of the Adelaide High
School, where his Ex. presided and promptly
arranged for another cricket match.
Merle Robertson, who annexed the Elder Scholar-
ship in 1915, is putting in some months on the
Continent and is booked for a concert in Copenhagen
early in the New Year. She goes back to London
in February and will give a concert there soon after
her return.
Lady Galway has succeeded Mrs. Humphrey Ward
in the chair of the Joint Advisory Parliamentary
Committee on Education. Both she and his ex-Ex.
are giving most of their time and interest to various
aspects of reconstruction work.
Mary Kitson, who has been an LL.B. since 1917,
has applied to be appointed a notary public. She
is the first woman here to do so, and the Court is
taking time to consider whether its answer will be
“No” or “Yes.”
There was a dance for nurses at Government House
on Thursday evening, and about 300 of them turned
up in anything from uniform to evening-dress—half
of them had seen war service. For the more sober-
footed there was a cinema show next evening.
The weather is playing scurvy tricks, setting itself
back to mid-winter and equinoctial gales, flooding
side-shows that are waiting for holiday trade on the
beaches, and—worst blow of all —cancelling the
pastoral performance of “Twelfth Night” that was
billed for Saturday evening. The show was to have
been in the Government House grounds, with Allan
Wilkie and his mummers as the performers, the
Minda committee as the organisers, and the Minda
Fund as the beneficiary.
G. E. Hale, of Wellington (M.L.), comes to
Adelaide to succeed Wyndham Heathcote as head of
the Unitarian Church. Heathcote, who was an
Anglican chaplain in England, India and South
Africa, a Queensland vicar, and a leading Unitarian
in Vic. and S. Aus., has just realised that there is
one continent he has not yet tried, and moves on to
America accordingly.
A private donor has added a Cumbrae Stewart to
the Muir Auld, J. R. Jackson and Penleigh Boyd
which the Art Gallery of Adelaide had bought from
the pictures at the “Federal” Exhibition. Govern-
ment House took another Stewart and landscapes
by Edward Davies and McLennan. Adelaide has run
these exhibitions for 23 years, and has filled an
Australian room at the Art Gallery with purchases.
It thinks Melbourne and Sydney might, now take a
turn at nursing the infant.
Portia Geach, writing from Noo Yoick,
confesses herself in love with the lights and
crowds of Broadway, and pleased with her-
self for having completed a couple of mural
decorations for a coming theatre in Mel-
bourne. She heard Evelyn Seotney sing with
Caruso in “La Juive,’’ and speaks highly
of Margaret Anglin in “The. Woman of
Bronze.” The theatre where Margaret
Anglin plays is right opposite Portia’s studio,
so when Portia feels homesick she just looks
across the street at the familiar name and
fancies herself back in Australia.

A WOMAN'S
LETTER
From
Dayid Jones
SYDNEY
The Forster lady gets a block vote by
the simplicity with which she performed her
first official job in Sydney. She dropped in
on the cake competition for the Children’s
Hospital in such an unobtrusive manner
that you weren’t quite sure for a minute
that she was vice-regal. Not so much as
an aide to carry the parcels or give the
instructions to the chauffeur, or a female
watch-dog to keep off the common herd!
She wore a blue silk jersey suit, with a
gold thread running through it, and a small
brown toque, and her first purchase, made
with great care, was a plum cake for the
nurses. Then she bought up piles of sponges
for the sick kiddies, and, last of all, one
for her own household. After that the cakes
went off at a great pace and at sky-high
prices.
The young and dressy went surfing or
racing on Saturday, leaving their elders and
the children to crowd into the Cricket
Ground. The Thomas Hugheses greeted
Alderman Billy McElhone on what is
practically his native lawn; Kelso King
and his wife had seats near by, and the
Sam Cohens and a pretty flapper daughter
were behind them. Some nice girls waved
•rapturously and often to C. E. Pellew, and
when circumstances permitted the flaxen-
haired South Australian made suitable
response. On the other hand no female
greeted the vast and lethargic Captain Arm-
strong. His voluminous trousers seemed in
imminent danger of collapsing about his
feet, and there may have been a feeling that
sudden movement would be fatal. Governor
Davidson, resplendent in an M.C.C. tie,
drifted down from the back of the stand at
about 3 o’clock, and, morally supported
by an A.D.C., stood for some time on the
ramp overlooking the packed lawn. He
seemed to realise presently that hardly a
soul recognised him, and passed sadly on
to the vice-regal box. The incident was in
a sense a measure of the assemblage. Those
present were mostly cricketing enthusiasts
pure and simple, down for the occasion from
the country or in from the remoter suburbs.
It was a most knowledgeable crowd, though
few present would have won prizes in a
dress competition.
It may have been the Test Match; cer-
‘tainly Randwick has never known a smaller
Christmas meeting. The girls in the tea-
rooms were for once not snatching from one
another the last bit of seed-cake and de-
pressed .scone to place before their customers.
The dressing was for the most part of the
washing variety; two out of every three
were befrilled and the third had miles of
accordeon pleating.
On Saturday night Lady Forster, flanked
by the Pitt-Rivers and the Digby good-
lookers, dropped into the Hippodrome for
the Orchestral concert. No square of car-
pet, no aides, and none of the usual flum-
mery that the Prince so vigorously kicked,
i.adjv Forster promises to be popular.
- All the kindergartens had their Christmas
trees this week. Two at Miller’s Point were
joyous things of sweet-smelling pine that
burst into a great golden star at the top
and cascaded into the doll or top or spade
that young Miller’s Point had been hoping
for. Mother, leaving the hopeless and never-
ending bits of washing out on the balcony,
put on her best blouse, and came to the
party with baby and sis, and an occasional
dad came too, and beamed with an awkward
sort of pleasure over the gift the nipper’s
fingers had worked for him. And the teach-
ers were the most simple and natural
hostesses, as the kindergarten teacher always
is.
Princess Ola Jane Humphrey Broadwood
is back again at the Australia, where she
first met her present husband a dozen years
ago. She was acting and he was globe-
trotting .at the time, and, as she remarked
to her dresser, they “passed like ships in
the night and spoke each other in passing.”
The brief conversation left an imperishable
impression on the young man, and the pre-
sent romance is the result. He is a first
cousin, by the way, of Captain Cumberlege.
The late “Swish” Broadwood, of the big
piano-making establishment, was a brother
of Mrs. Cumberlege, senior.
The Soubeiran and Gurney components of
the just-returned French-Australian mission
were given the glad hand at the Carlton
the other afternoon amid red and white car-
nations and the French and Australian flags.
Miss Soubeiran told of the distribution of
the League’s money among the French
people, and rejoiced over a further £lOOO
that was going to benefit the French child-
ren ; and Miss Gurney described Australia
House and Waratah House, the homes for
the orphans of fallen Poilu that N. S. Wales
has been godmother and godfather to, and
threw a special word of thanks to Newcastle,
which had handed out £5OO to help the
little Ententes grow up to be worthy sons
and daughters of their blue-clad soldier
daddies. Consul-General Campana passed
the company’s congratulations to the speak-
ers. Of the hundred or so gathered together
were the whole Playoust and Moreau
families, Mrs. Jewett, Mrs. Holman, the
McMillan and Cullen ladies, and represen-
tatives of the whole French colony. After
that it was mostly tea and congratulations
on the subsiding of the flood ; and the women
who had been forced to sea-serpent through
the week before spread their butterfly fab-
rics in a murmur of contentment that
sounded like the drumming of insects over a
honey-freighted garden.
The girls from the chorus and other old
friends of the profession paid a last call at
Florrie Young’s house at Darling Point last
week. Already Florrie’s little household
gods have been scattered by the auctioneer’s
hammer; and, despite the burst of sunshine
in the early w T eek, the small, high house,
with its lawn terraced to Double Bay, its
boatshed and its rowing-boat, had the air
of desolation which falls upon a dog that has
lost its master.
Dr. Stewart McKay gave a big Palace
Theatre party and supper by way of fare-
well to Marie Tempest. The Alex. Hays
were there (she came back on the Orvieto
the other day with some wonderful clothes
and the appearance of a girl of 20) ; also
Sheila Loughborough and Mrs. Sep Levy
and the Russian Prince and many more.
Dr. McKay is said to be selling his beau-
tiful Elizabeth Bay house and taking refuge
from the servant problem in a flat.
The Swiss tossed their heads at Austria in
the Conservatorium one recent night, when the
whole of the Tyrol apparently emptied itself
on to the stage and made exceeding merry to
the accompaniment of Rossini’s music, even
though it knew the tyrant Austria was wait-
ing just across the way. However, the Con-
servatorium choir, with Roland Foster to
lead it, was utterly reckless, and Gladys
Verona profits by its victory. On two nights
a big house heard “William Tell,” and he is
to repeat his affidavit (by special request) on
this Thursday night. Gladys herself in the
second half of the programme was a bril-
liantly tuneful mad Lucia. Among the long
list of assisting artists Jean Drummond flung
in the charm of a pair of beautiful ankles
and her sound artistry.
Singer Gladys Cole, who was lucky enough
to be adopted by wealth, has sent a cheque
for £2O to the slowly-mounting Gladys
Verona fund.
Art in Australia is getting quite a stride
on—we apply it even in our cakeshops.
There is a new wliitc-and-gold confectioner’s
box in York-street whose window is marked
off into two gilt frames, each shrining a
befrosted masterpiece of the cook’s art; and
for background there are curtains to tone
with the icing.
Fortunately the disrupted countries of
Europe continue to throw up a Princeling or
two to keep the serial going. The Russian,
Obilensky, has naturally drifted into that
inner circle of Royal intimates of which
Sheila Loughborough and Mollie Little are
the pivot.
Muriel Mills (she is a niece of the .James
Mills knight) has packed up all her wonder-
ful trousseau, slammed the door of 52
Macleay-street behind her, and is off by the
Niagara to join Maorilander Major Rigg,
for better or worse, in Mexico or thereabouts.
He has an insurance job in that country.
There was a gathering of the clans at
Lindfield on Saturday for the wedding of
Archibald Douglas Mcßurney and Constance
Agnes Mcßobert, the Titian beauty of the
family which has been long connected with
the Robert Harper firm. The billiard-room
at Unara, eldest-brother John’s home, had
been turned into a chapel, where the bride,
in white georgette, was attended by Bessie
Kidd and Margaret Mcßobert, with soldier-
pal Eric Morgan standing by the ’groom.
Healths were drunk later on the broad
verandahs. Constance safely in the keeping
of her upstanding Light Horseman at Baulk-
ham Hills, Mrs. Mcßobert, with two un-
attached daughters, will leave by the Naldera
on February 1 for a 12-months’ visit to
England and France, where one of the
bravest of sons sleeps in a soldier’s grave.
It was “two love” all right at St.
Stephen’s last Thursday evening, when tennis-
player Harold Stewart Utz married Gwen
Chiplin, who has got herself into the papers
more than once for her own work at the nets.
Gwen is the Jack Chiplins’ only bud and
has grown up at Ivirribilli. She wore shell-
pink, with the usual cascade of tulle and
silver embroideries, and had three brides-
maids, Pat McCausland (a grand-daughter of
late ex-Premier Lyne), Kathleen D’Arcy and
Daisy Payne. Usher's hotel provided the
wedding dinner for about 130 guests.
Two Tyrell cousins are to marry the
Finch brothers, and girls and boys are all
of the same North Shore suburb. Dorothy
Tyrell, of Glentkorne, Roseville, has decided
that Captain Clifford H. Finch, ex-A.1.F.-er,
will do her for life ; while Irene, of Ilinemoa.
has melted to the cordial glance of Clif-
ford’s elder brother Frank.
Back to Australia, in time for Christmas,
Mrs. F. G. Sargood—and there’s going to be
a real Christmas at Tudor. Muriel Dangar
and a just thawed-out Mrs. Herrick Knowles
are also among the homing birds.
Rose Scott is still suffering from the effects
of a bad fall and is confined to her house;
and cheery Belle Rankin is chained up to a
bed in St. Vincent’s Private Hospital. Gas-
tritis is her little bit of Christmas cheer.
Twilight House will scarcely lift its piano
out of the funds raised by the dance at the
Wentworth the other night. Among the Twi-
lighters who were nearly swallowed up by
the big ballroom were the Remington type-
writer Dobells, English cricketer Waddington
(he came in Mrs. Sydney Moore’s party),
and a lady from Melbourne whose headgear
burst into a crescendo of Paradise plumes.
What would Dame Margaret and the League
of Bird Lovers have done to her?
On Thursday chairman Win. Tilley, of
the Cumberland Paper Board Mills, piloted
shareholders and their wives and “the trade”
to the headwaters of the winding Lane Cove
River to introduce them to the romance of
paper-board manufacture. No Sydney indus-
try is more picturesquely located than this
mill in the wooded gullies of Sydney’s show
river, where the most up-to-date plant the
world can provide has just been installed.
Premier John Storey was to have set the
wheels going, but as he has lately been
breaking union rules he took a spell, and
Chief-Sec. Dooley attended to bestow the
Government’s blessings. After the chair-
man and a 22-stone managing-director had
told of the interesting struggles of the enter-
prise, and numerous others had muttered
eulogies, there was a scramble to view the
huge machine which chews pulp at one end
and turns out cut and polished board ready
for the box-manufacturer at the other. Then
a worried river-mariner broke in with the
warning that the tide was fast receding, and
there was a scamper for the city.
Mrs. Agnes Janson has been turning an
ear to the Gilbert and Sullivan perform-
ances. She is over from Melbourne for the
Christmas season, and is guest of Mr. and
Mrs. Brownless.
Last week, in spite of its brilliant sun-
shine, was unlucky for fetes. The Ascham
one ended up by hiding a diminished head
in the Sydney Hospital Auxiliary rooms.
At the Eynesbury affair, opened by Mrs.
Wright, the battalions of stall-holders kept
the wolf from the door of the Girls’ Friendly
Hostel by brisk inter-trade, much after the
style of the castaways who turned an honest
penny by taking in each other’s washing.
Dame Chisholm, of Ivantara, and Olive Servia
King were among the workers. Mrs. W. L.
Langley, on behalf of the G.F.S., passed the
word of welcome to their just-returned pre-
sident, who has brought back an autoed
photo of Queen Mary to beautify the
entrance-hall of the hostel.
A large contingent of distinguished Dutch
arrived from Java in the middle of the wet
week. After first aid to the apparently
drowned had been given, they demanded the
blood of those who had talked to them of
Sydney’s glorious summer.
Who said Christmas party? Phyllis had
told Dick, and Dick had told Ireen, and
Ireen, rushing down the street, had buried
the family feud and breathlessly confided it
to Johnnie, who was giving the new baby an
airing in the soap-box on wheels that is the
perambulator of Baby Woolloomooloo. The
square Swede shouted it to the smiling meek-
eyed little Chinee girl who was plaiting a red
ribbon in her hair. Up the street and down
the lanes the word went; and out poured the
youngsters, about 200 strong, to besiege Mrs.
Ormsby at the Guild Depot.
At the side-door the kiddies battered, while
depressed-looking mothers went into the shop
and cast a discerning eye over the shelves in
search of singlet or socks, or “a dress for
Olive, Miss Edwards —you know, the second
one.” One mother wanted a soft hat for
John, “who is 13 and helps on a bottle-o’s
cart.” At the side door the clamor grows
louder. Somebody gives you a white ticket
and that lets you into the party. “Miss
Ormsby, you promised me last Christmas I
could come.” “Miss Ormsby, I come for one
for me little sister —she’s gotter bad foot.”
The little Chinee girl’s eyes look anxious
but she doesn’t speak ; and soon she is pushed
to the back by sharper elbows, and presently
drifts away altogether. The Swede and a
little chocolate-colored boy stand together.
“Tell ’er your mother comes here every day,”
prompted the white-headed one. A hundred
tickets are given out and go fluttering away
in glad hands. Fifty more are given out
recklessly by Mrs. Ormsby. Then forebod-
ing seizes her. One hundred was the stipu-
lated number —suppose there aren’t enough
cake.s or toys to go round! She calls a stop.
Amidst a pitiful burst of “Oh, Miss Ormsby,
can’t I come to the party?” and 50 little
hands fly into the air clamoring attention,
like they do at school. “Mr. Mercer will
give the rest of you tickets for the big
Christmas-tree in the Town Hall.” she says.
“Oh, no, he won’t, Miss Ormsby ; he’s only
giving them to the Sunday-school kids!” erics
a beetle-browed little atheist. But the side-
door of the depot simply has to be closed
at last, for the room upstairs, where the
party is to be held, will be almost bursting
asunder with the numbers already invited.
Still, the supplication goes on. A deter-
mined-looking brigand, with his elbows
out of his jacket, slips through the
shop into the room beyond. He leans
up against the table. “Miss Ormsby,
I want a ticket for my little sister.” At
his heels enters a long-legged girl rocking a
baby in her arms, and a girl of six dragging
a befuzzed child in indeterminate clothing.
“Miss Ormsby,” dashes in Long Legs. “I’m
Phyllis, an’ my sister Olive and my cousin
Jimmy they both got tickets for the party,
byt 1 couldn’t run because of the baby, an’ I
didn’t get none.” “Miss Ormsby, I'wanter
ticket for my little sister.” “Miss Ormsby,
this is a very little girl, an’ she didn't get a
ticket. Miss Ormsby, she’s a very little
girl, an’ she wouldn’t take up much room.”
“I wanter ticket for my little sister, Miss
Ormsby. Her name’s Phyllis.” Strange how
many Phyllises there are, and never a greeny
slope about the place, and the only suspicion
of flocks are fore- and hind-quarters swinging
in the butcher’s shop.
Three more tickets are given out, and pre-
sently the depot is being closed for the night,
and the long-legged girl (still rocking her
baby) and the brigand and “Miss Ormsby”
are the only ones of the anxious crowd left
in the street. But around the corner the
little Chinee girl is still plaiting the red
ribbon in her hair, and gazing at the door of
hope. And if we—you and I—had re-
membered in time, there needn’t have been
one disappointed kiddie going to bed last
Friday night in those ugly oven-like little
rookeries to which the depot is a sort of
heaven upon earth.
Mrs. Ormsby, who smiles out of this Falk
photograph, is arrang-
ing the depot’s an-
nual picnic during the
Christmas holidays,
and wouldn’t you
just hate, because of
that little contri-
bution you forgot to
send, to have that
little half-Chinee
girl left out a
second time? Mrs.
Ormsby ha s been
carrying on this
work for years.
You knew her first
perhaps as Inys
Sutton. The Girls’
Realm Guild throws
its mantle over her
splendid efforts.
Brisbane has her word :
A Brisbane girl in London mentions that Lady
Carbery (who was Josfi Metcalfe, of Toowoomba)
has returned to Blighty after spending the summer
in France. Her mother was with her, while papa
was busy captaining an English cricket team in the
States. Lady Carbery is the only Queensland-born
peeress at the moment; but we ’ave ’opes.
More volunteer workers are wanted for the Braille
Writing Association, founded by Lady Lamington.
About 70 volumes are added each year to the library,
which now has 1440 volumes, although for the last
two years only 19 staunch souls have carried on the
good work. A number of blind soldiers are mem-
bers .of the library, and books are regularly sent
also to the Blind Institution. Thanks to Sir Hamil-
ton Goold-Adams, there is a good stock of paper
in hand. All that is wanted now are workers who
will give an hour or two a day, so that those who
cannot see may not be cut off altogether from litera-
ture.
Mr. and Mrs. Eric Hayne’s wedding day has
dawned. He is our leading violinist. His wife is
one of the Ipswich Cribbs, and was understudied
at the altar by a young sister and Miss Macfarlane.
The Cambrian choir filled the church with melody—
bridegroom has been its star performer for ages.
At All Saints’, Lilia Foxton, the Gibson Foxtons’
only chick, wedded Lewis Bernays Webb (his mamma

day Allie Scott, second daughter of the Scotts of
Hornet Bank, wedded Jim Sparks, of Lyndley, Jan-
dowae, son of the late J. Sparks, of Barbigal, Dubbo.
Vera Scott was the only bridesmaid.
Florence Ryder has taken the gold badge of un-
paid housekeeper from Lieut. Mclntyre Pitt, M.C.,
of Sydney. Her cousin, Kathleen Geary, was a
piquante bridesmaid.
Sir Matthew Nathan “blew in” to the unregistered
race meeting at Ipswich the other day. Our new
Ex. does not find it necessary to travel with guards,
and may be seen hieing homewards in a common
thrippenny tram. Sir Henry Norman was the last
Gov. who wandered about the city alone, and every
man, woman and child in the place knew and loved
him.

WADE
the Original
One-Man Drag-Saw.
The oldest men in the Drag-Saw business built the
first WADE in the great forests of North-West
America over fifty-five years ago. When its wonder-
ful labor-saving value was realised it was universally
introduced.
Now thousands of WADES operate successfully
every day throughout every timbered section of
the world.
The new WADE must be actually used to be fully
appreciated.
SPECIAL FEATURES:—
Even distribution of weight.
Sturdy 4-horse-power motor.
Positive wheel-lock.
Simple and positive log-dogs.
Great strength, faithful construction.
The WADE can be handled with ease by one man;
it can be operated on the most uneven or rocky
ground. Large or small logs look alike to the Wade.
Write for full particulars.
It is worth investigation.

Our Record 2-Year
We are just towards closing the best half-
year we ever had in our retail business.
It has been wonderful the way in which our
old, and , many new customers have bought
during the last six months.
WHY?
We can only presume that a keenly-discriminat-
ing public have realised that we have given
special values and offered the latest and best
goods.
We certainly try to do so.
Large capital—great turnover— unresting
effort —long experience—fine organisation—huge
buying combined with a determination to give
good service and unequalled value may account
for our success.
The great public seem to conclude so.

(Scotland) Act 1891, by Mrs. NELLIE BEATON or
GORDON, wife of and residing with Hugh Gordon,
Ship’s Steward, No. 17 Despard Road, Highgate,
London N., with consent and concurrence of her
said husband, craving the Court to find that her
brother Hugh Beaton, junior, latterly residing at
Manfred Station, via Ralranald, New South wales,
son of the late Hugh Beaton, sometime Postmaster
and Merchant, Strathpeffer, should be presumed to
have died on 30th June, 1915, or alternatively on
13th January, 1914, the following deliverance has

Dingwall, 28th September, 1920. The Sheriff-
Substitute, having considered the foregoing applica-

William John Beaton, designed in the application,
and also appoints intimation of the presentation ana
purport thereof to be made by advertisement once
in each of the Rosshire Journal, North Star ana

Name and address must appear on the MSS. No
t liability is undertaken re contributions volun-
tarily submitted; and no MS. will be returned
unless stamps accompany.
36: Your muse needs a tonic... .Mat: Do
give Ireland a rest and pay a bit of attention to
Australia.... Walbundrie: Certainly ; that’s our
excuse for being here.... Kyber: Too didactic....
Ruth M.: Counted “hubby” 15 times in three pages
and then stopped. A weary sub-editor says that in
one week he altered the word to “husband” 167
times. Has the plain English been put on Sassiety’s
“index,” or what?... .Imperialist: A live press-
agent would do far more good for Australia in the
U.S.A. than an ambassador. There are times when
it would be an advantage to this country to get a
“story” into the Yankee papers.... Rocks: Wait till
he’s out of the wood before you hooray. For even if
the N. S. Wales Parliament passes the bill to restore
Meagher to the roll of solicitors —and tliat seems
very likely—the High Court may have a word fp
say about it. If a solicitor of a State Court has
any rights before the High Court, then the latter
may declare that a Constitutional question is in-
volved... .S.J.S.: The number of times you kissed
her doesn’t matter.... Fanuela: Charger can’t gallop
here.... Wm. N.: “Jimmy” won’t d 0... .M.P.S.C.:
“The gaudy remnant” of your soul llutters among
good phrases set in poor verse... .J.S.P.: None of
them get near.... Aragun: A poor old yam in poorer
verse.... Bogie River: Can’t find any mirth in it...
York: The rhymes in “Friendship” are bad. Look
at the scheme of the octave: “these” —“sympathies,”
“is” —“bliss,” “serve”—“reserve,” “observe” —
“serve.” Not one of these is right... .E.T.S.: Don’t
like “The Message”... .0. V. Twist: “Red Chick”
might suit a children’s magazine... .J.L. (East-
wood): “Mr. Buncombe” goes wearily.... Gaston:
No use... .A.L.F.: A sonnet has to be a lot better
than that. .. .Kayo: Yarn of doctored beer has no
thrill /Eneas H.: “The Sage” doesn’t score
Harry W.: Nothing there J.J.A.: Sorrowful verse
rejected.. .R.E.F.H.: Verse not quite up...R.G.H.:
There have been many worse first attempts, but you
can’t go far in that direction. Try something
that looks real... .F.V.E.: “The Desert” is full of
the regular commonplaces.... Alice J.: Not up....
H.R.M.: Not for us.. .W.P. (Proserpine) : Too crude.
...Elby: Nothing there... Dejay: No use sending us
that wordy stuff.... Lantana King: iAs far as we
can read the dirty scrawl there is nothing in it;
and the accompanying letter is worse than the copy.
....Wm. F. (Fiji): “Joy Riders” no good.... Leah
H.: “Call of the Bush” creeps weakly over old
ground. .. .A.L.M.: An old yarn badly t01d.... Rapid
Fire: Not enough in it Scottie: Doesn’t strike us.
. ...H.F.W.: Not up by many yards... .Pod: Let it
go:—
. ...T.H.W.: Good enough sketch, but not for our
needs. .. .J.A.X.: Not good enough... Lilac Domino:
Impossible verse... .E.E.M.: They haven’t enough in
them that is new or newly expressed... Chunjoberree:
You have some skill in that combine, so why not
strike out on original lines? Mere echoes of another
writer are never welcome... . W.M.W.: No use to us.
R.P. (Bendigo) : Feeble little flutters without
force or beauty.... Alex.: “Going Home” doesn’t
move U5....J.W. (Summer Hill): Send it to a
humorous magazine for curates. .. .A.E.G.: “Gettin’
Goin’” held for inquest M.: Doesn’t strike us...
Amateur: No good Paul B.: Nothing there
Angus: Providence sent you to the back of Rabaul
expressly that you might tell us about it; instead,
you send some tame little stuff that might be written
by a flapper who had never been past Redfern....
Bellerive: Come in, come in. It wouldn’t be like
Christmas without you:—
Charon: She takes the nationality of her hus-
band A.F.W.: Too drowsy. Hard condensation
might make it acceptable. .. .Ouyen: Send name and
address to the accountant.
TO ARTISTIC (AND INARTISTIC)
CORRESPONDENTS.
K.U.: Decorative little sketch, but the posing lady
with the elaborate costume and mis-shapen legs
mars the landscape J..J.: Inartistic smudges
M.S.C.: The joke has been worn threadbare
W.H.C.: A feeble jest wasted on a drawing of some
promise R.A.M.: Where did you borrow the
poses? L.R.: Weak drawings afflicted with feeble
humor W.H.D.: All miss A. 53.: Not copies,
are they? If they are original efforts you may have
another shot. But first snare jokes with a little
more ginger in them.... M. 8.: Mere student
•sketches W.F.M.: Unappealing trifles T. 8.:
Not nearly good enough.... Mark M.: Your cocky
-will never pitch hay with his hands in that position.
(P.S.: Tell him to knock off smoking while he’s at
this job.)
A fierce sidelight is thrown upon some
dark passages of the Great War by a con-
fession of Lieut. “Willett,” late of the
A.E.F. As Hans Willers he was a cadet
in the German Army until 1914, “when
with 300 cadets he was sent to the United
States to join the army and become officers.”
The young man did not serve in France, it
seems, but doubtless some of the other 299
cadets from Germany were among the enthu-
siasts who helped to vin der var for Ameriga.
Now the wowsers rant and rave
And for Prohibition crave,
I think that in the olden times they’d stake ’em,
And if I had my way
This I would loudly say:
“We’ll take them to the baking-house and bake ’em.”
Now the family goes to church
But they leave me in the lurch,
For I am far from being a wowser yet,
And if you got no money
It ain’t all bread and honey,
But if you have it’s on you they will sweat.
Now the wowsers they do preach
How far old Nick can reach.
And will bid you at the forking roads beware,
But I’ll sing a little song
As I race my life along
The big broad path that leads to God-knows-where.
An old bruiser who’d
Drifted life’s rough ways,
In a reverie did brood
O’er he’s early days.
Memories of the past
Around him did cling,
When he shone as a star
In the arena prize-ring.
High stakes he’d reaped
And squandered it all,
He was one of the school
Who’d suffered a fall.
He frowned as he knocked
The ash from he’s pipe,
And muttered “A dream
Is the longest life.”

I Have Found Beauties.
[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
LET all the roses wither on the spray,
And all the stars of night like bright
tears fall,
I have found beauties fairer far than they,
Sweeter than honey from a crannied wall,
Sweeter than music at a festival.
What flower is redder than the blood that
flows
From the heart-wound of him who mutely
dies
For others’ sake or Duty’s? Not a rose
Can match that royal red beneath our
skies,
The lovely, awful flower of sacrifice!
What perfect star that crowns the summer
night
Is whiter than the secret, star-shaped
flame
On which some fix their aching inner sight
Across what pits of slime, what gulfs of
blame,
What writhing fogs of fear, and doubt
and shame?
Let blossoms fade and perish, sunsets die,
And all earth’s fair, frail things like leaves
be strown ;
Courage, a white torch lifted to the sky,
Flames god-like though a world be over-
thrown,
Brighter than any dawn our eyes have
known.
Oh, quiet, steadfast hearts on land and sea,
Whose light is Duty, and whose iron strain
Seems half immortal to the soul of me,
Beside that light are all star-splendors
vain—
Heedless, you tread the purple flowers of
pain!
The shattered deck reels to the reddened
foam ;
The doomed ranks rally with a triumph-
cry,
And charge the bayonets; the plough-turned
loam
Is fattened with the blood of those who lie
In the thick dark, earth-blinded to the sky.
As in the days of Time’s wild crimson dawn,
Wheji with bare hands you gripped the
tiger’s hide
And man and beast rolled on some forest
lawn,
So now you strive with storm and fire and
tide,
And passions ravening, like beasts denied.
And you are scarred and seared. The fight
goes on—
Earth’s one great battlefield: her seas are
red;
The battle-scattered blossoms all are gone;
Death’s mingled with the very dust you
tread —
Ah ! but what glory waits upon the dead !
There are your laurels! There the deathless
rose
Garlands the victor’s charger. Splendidly
Through incense-clouds of praise and fame
. he goes;
And, like a dream, pain’s shadow-memories
flee
Before the splendor of Infinity.

DULCIE DEAMER.
In the Absence of the White Cow.
[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
THE other night at half-past twelve I
went out in my pyjamas to chase a
white cow. The animal had observed
my dahlia-bed earlier in the day, carefully
noted its situation, tested the fence for
several chains, discovered a spot at which
it was possible to break through, and retired
to a cleft in a rock to wait for darkness. It
irritated her a good deal to find that my
study lamp was not extinguished until mid-
night ; but shortly after that hour she began
to move. My seventh sense, which is a com-
bination of smell, hearing, psycho-analysis,
telepathy, anger and devotion to duty, told
me that an eye was moving in the darkness.
I took my electric torch and went in fierce
pursuit. As fast as I could step over the
possible sleeping snakes, which my bare
ankles invited to a feast of revenge, I charged
upon the destroyer. The first stone landed
two feet above the milk; the second wakened
a tree; the third struck a retreating tail;
the fourth rang clean and true on the
horn. I was in luck. Three hits out of
four is excellent work; nothing could have
been much better except three hits out of
four on the person of the owner of the cow.
The owners of wandering cattle are all
thieves; and I am in perfect agreement with
the reformers who take a stick and break
the backs of such owners wherever they meet
them. One friend boasts that he killed a
hundred of the vermin last season; and I
am sure that by a combined effort all the
owners of wandering cows could be exter-
minated in a week. It would be a great
mercy to the men thus put out of their
misery. No person whose cow eats another’s
washing on the line, much less his dahlias,
can ever hope to have a moment’s peace in
life. Even Cain, Judas Iscariot and second-
rate actors turn from him with loathing.
But the White cow did not care who owned
her when the pyjamaed avenger with an
electric torch was close upon her hocks. With-
out pausing even to think grass she lifted
up her udder and ran. I lost sight of her
in the serpent-haunted scrub; but lured by
a glimmer of white, I still pursued and sent
the noises of my defiance far in front of my
careful slippers. The white object was
not the cow. It was a perfectly naked
gentleman sitting upon a log.
“Good morning,” I said, “have you seen
a white cow?”
“I have not.”
“Don’t you find it rather cool out here?”
“Cool, is it? Why wouldn’t it be cool if
it wanted to?”
“Are you making a long stay in Sample-
town?” I knew he wasn’t one of the regular
residents. \
“A man must stay somewhere till the
trouble blows over. ’Tis all the fault yof
being born young and with no clothes on.”
He spoke with a merry twinkle in his eye
and with just the suspicion of an accent
which is usually associated with the con-
versation of a noble race, the mention of
which is now regarded as a breach of the
Commonwealth Peace Precautions Act.
“You’re not out here for pleasure, then?”
“Pleasure! What pleasure would there
be sitting on a cold log talking to a man
that is after chasing a cow?”
“Look,” I said. “I have a spare bedroom
I can offer you. Why not come in and get
a decent sleep?”
I didn’t know who he was; but his dejec-
tion combined with his mode of speech to
awaken my sympathy.
He shook his head. “You don’t know who
you’re talking to,” he said. “I’m far enough
from any bed I can rest in this night.”
“Well, what about a glass of whisky?”
“Ah!”
I was at a loss to understand that large
intake of breath which paused upon the full
vowel.
“Will I try?” he said. “I’m not sure,
mind you, that I’m material enough to do
it. Will you throw a stone at me and see
if it hits me?”
“Throw a stone?” I said.
“Yes, throw a stone. If it goes through
me it’s no use. If it hits me with a plump
I’ll have that drink.”
I picked up a red pound of ironstone and
lobbed it at him mildly. It might have
missed, but he moved himself lightly into the
line of fire and received the missile with a
round drum-like note on the solar plexus.
“Good,” he said, and smacked his lips in
anticipation.
Four glasses brought a tone to his eyes
and a light to his tongue. Then, sitting in
a big cane chair with a newspaper to pro-
tect him against the night air, he told me
all about it.
He had died in Dublin on the 29th of
February, and that combination of circum-
stances had operated to create a condition
knownto the dead as “partial biological
entity.” It took two glasses of whisky to
explain the term; but I gathered that it
meant a state in which a person hovered
between spirit and matter, and was liable to
be called out of his bed at any hour of the
night to assume flesh if certain conditions
were fulfilled by a medium. All the dead
were liable to the same kind of interference
with personal liberty in varying degree; but
most of them possessed a greater power of
resistance. Very few really important spirits
had ever answered a summons to appear at
a sdance or even to endure cross-examina-
tion through the legs of a dining-room table.
“Not that it mattered much to me, mind
you,” he said, “until I met the great man.
llow would a man be great and him a little
withered soul of a thing like a plucked hen?
No matter; he was a great man in the news-
papers one time, and he suffered from par-
tial biological entity. No, no; nothing like
him ever died in Dublin since Brian Boru
put the Danes into the sea. There are other
ways of getting partial besides that. His
way was trying to see through a brick wall
with his two eyes shut, or some other foolish-
ness.
“Well, he was a great man, and all the
legs of all the tables wanted him ; and when
the tables were not wanting him there was a
woman medium wanting tp take photographs
of him in his nightshirt. It was hardly
decent; and the poor soul of him got no rest
at all.
“One day he started to pour out his tale
to me ; and ’twas sorry I felt surely for the
poor little soul of a great man doing circus
tricks up and down the world and getting
no fun out of it. Now, if it was me, thinks
I, and they would get a way of calling me
into the legs of Dooley’s table, I could find
it in my soul to go. I knew what was on
Dooley’s table every night of the good year
—whisky, sir, whisky. Would I have my
photograph taken in an old nightshirt sit-
ting at Dooley’s table? Would a frog know
when it was going to rain?
“ ’Twas the divil in me made me talk that
word out loud. The little soul began hop-
ping up and down like the lid of a pot.
“ ‘Dooley’s,’ says he. ‘Why, that’s the
great house for spirit-rapping. That’s the
place where they hold a sdance four times a
day and take photographs every night. A
most wonderful medium is Norah.’
“‘Norali?’ says I. ‘ls it Norah Dooley,
you mean, the girl with black hair and a
smile like the angels of Heaven?’
“ ‘That’s the lady,’ says the little soul of
the great man. ‘Her father is a leading
spiritualist.’
“ ‘Meaning that he sells good spirits,’ says
I, winking; for the memory of Tim Dooley
and his daughter was a joy to me that not
even death could destroy.
“ ’Twas all a trick and scheme of the little
soul of the great man. How he heard of
Dooley’s I never could find out, nor how he
hit on the name of Norah : but there was I
feeling the tongue of me cleaving to the roof
of my mouth and thinking of the good rap-
ping in the legs of that table.
“ ‘Will you change names with me?’ says I.
“ ‘ ’Tis a great name to lose,’ says he.
“ ‘ ’Tis more sledp you need,’ says I. I
knew sleep was plentiful with me and whisky
very scarce.
“ ‘Well,’ says he, ‘just to oblige you.’
“Will you believe me, sir, from that day
to this I never got a call at all from Dooley’s,
never got a sup of whisky till this blessed
night. Work! The way I’ve rapped and
been photographed and said what mother
was doing would make any man careful about
the day of the month he took for dying.”
"But,” I said, “it is surely not through
the efforts of a medium that you sit naked
all night in the bush?”
“Whisht,” he said, mysteriously lowering
his voice. “Can’t you hear them calling me?
’Tis hiding I am, hiding from the fools of
the world that want to make me sit down
and talk like an old woman confessing to a
priest on Thursday. Listen. That’s the
twenty-ninth time. Bad cess to them !”
I saw he was going to leave me, and
pleaded with him to have another drink.

HOLIDAY
WITH YOU
MISHAPS
It isn’t wise to go away for a holiday without a pot of Zam-Buk, the ever-
ready healer.
Many a mishap might mar your enjoyment without Zam-Buk, whereas
with this pure first-aid you can obtain speedy relief from smarting pain,
and ward off poisoning.
Sore faces, sore feet, sunburnt skins and rough hands are sure to be prevalent,
too, and anointing with Zam-Buk should be a nightly measure with all who value
comfort and a clear, healthy skin. Zam-Buk is wonderfully soothing for sore,
aching or tender feet, and invaluable for mosquito bites and insect stings.
Zam-Buk is a healing, soothing, antiseptic skin-dressing, neatly packed and
ready for use, and as handy as it is reliable.
ZAM-BUK soothes and heals all
those nasty skin troubles so pre-
valent in Summer, such as Pimples,
Chafed Feet, Sunburn, Raw Per-
spiring Surfaces, Bashes; and is
invaluable for Cuts, Bruises,
Burns, Scalds, Ringworm,
Barber’s Rash, and injured or
unhealthy conditions of the skin.
Obtainable from all chemists and
stores at 1/6 per pot, or 3/6
family size; post free from C. E.
Fulford (Aus.), Etd., 39 Pitt
Street, Sydney,
PRICHXY HEAT.
Mrs. J. A. Richardson, First Avenue,
St. Peters, Adelaide, says:—“A rash,
which I think was prickly heat, came
out all over me, and painful hard
lumps formed. While this lasted I
could get very little rest, but on
using Zam-Buk my skin was soothed
and I was very quickly eased of all
irritability. Zam-Buk completely
cured me.”
BITTEN BY SANDFEIES.
Mrs. G. Balmer, of 13 George
Street, Burwood, Sydney, writes: —
“Twelve months ago sores broke out
on my son’s legs, as a result of being
bitten by sandflies. These sores
assume the appearance 'of large boils.
Not until we used Zam-Buk did his
condition improve. Under the Zam-
Buk treatment the inflammation sub-
sided, the wounds became clean, and
after about a month’s treatment Jack’s
legs were quite better.”
Refuse Inferior Substitutes.
SUNBURN AND FRECKLE?.
Miss Doris Wells, 271 Brisbane
Street, Launceston, Tas., says:—“l
suffered from skin blemishes and
freckles. Having heard of Zam-Buk’s
great value for skin ccmplaints I
thought I would try it. I purchased
a pot of Zam-Buk, and massaged the
balm well into the skin twice daily.
In a short time the blemishes disap-
peared, leaving my skin perfectly
clear.
“During an outing some of our'
family got terribly sunburnt. When
Zam-Buk was applied the irritation
was quickly alleviated. Zam-Bul: pre-
vented blistering, and in a few days
the exposed skin was as healthy as
ever.’’
SOKE FEET.
Mr. Walter Robinson, of
288 Palmer Street, Sydney,
Says:—“l suffer terribly
from tender feet, which
get so fearfully hot that
at times my suffering is
unbearable. I have found
that for cooling and sooth-
ing the feet Zam-Buk is
wonderful. After washing
my feet * always massage
them with Zam-
Buk, which has
jjua, which lias
a delightfully
coolin'
result.

“Hold me down,” lie said, “tie me to the

I tried to grasp his shoulders, but some
occult drawing force had him half out of
the window before I secured a proper hold.
There was a fierce tug-of-war; then the outer
pull slackened. Slowly he came back : and
there was a look of triumph on his face
“God save Ireland!” he remarked as he
wiped the perspiration from his brow with
the newspaper.
“Listen!” I said.

We gulped our whisky down in haste. It

PAT O'MAROI
The Ivory Runners.
[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
AS Hun Yu crouched in the edge of the
tangled jungle on the bank of the
far upper reaches of the Hoang Ho
he found time to curse his foolishness in con-
tracting to hand over to the captain of the
Russian schooner, ’riding at anchor at a
certain spot in the Yellow Sea, the fifty pieces
of ivory he had, in a reckless moment, under-
taken to supply. The fact that it had to be
strong, healthy ivory, muscular, and sound in
wind and body, added to the arduousness of
Man’s undertaking. Because of this bother-
some clause he could not grab the first
samples that came to hand, but must, with
his henchmen, sneak about the outskirts of
the villages at night, marking down his prey
one at a time. It was all right for the Rus-
sian in his schooner. At worst he would
have only to return home with an empty
ship; he might even pick up a chance cargo.
But should Han’s plans miscarry there would
be no return trip and no back cargo for him.
Violence and sudden death would be his
portion should the Fates, in a moment of
levity, turn down their thumbs.
For the Government no longer countenanced
the running of ivory. It had, indeed, clearly
expressed its determination to stamp out the
traffic, and only the boldest spirits now
ventured up the river in quest of bushmen.
For the venturer who got caught by the
coast-guard there was but short shrift; the
branch of a tree and a length of rope took
the place of a trial, and the freed slaves
danced at the foot of the tree while the hap-
less ivory runner kicked his way into eternity
at the rope’s end.
A,ll. these things Han knew when starting
out; but in Russia’s new scheme of the
Brotherhood of Mian the Chinese executioner
played an important part, and prices ran high
for healthy Celestials who could swing a
machete or fire a rifle in the name of the
Cause.
As Han crouched in the riot of dripping
undergrowth, listening to the clash of heathen
music and watching through the crevices of
the jungle the dark forms of the bushmen
flitting about the cook-fires, the fireflies
about his head reminded him of the vari-
colored lanterns at some festive gathering
back in the haunts of civilised man. But
hum 0 DOthlng , civili « ed in the insistent
limn of the mosquitoes, the droning of the
innumerable beetles, the chirping song of the
fW« 6tS ’ °i V t ,‘ e croaking of the giant tree-
overhead. Ihese other things, the sar-
donic croaking of the tree-frogs particularly
were more in keeping with Man Yu's
mood as he changed and rechanged his
} osxtmn m the reeking, soaking forest, wait-
ing against the time when the lights of tlm
die down, preparing a fitting
stage toi the dark deed Han would do. iii
truth, Han was growing desperate. For
nights on e nd he had known no sleep; the wet
clothes he had not changed for days bred
malaria and rheumatism that plaved tricks
with his imagination and racked his joints:
tween decks in his junk on the river more
than two score captive bushmen languished,
likely to die on his hands and give him his
work all over again ; the temper of his men.
too long held in restraint, was growing nasty •
and above and over all there hovered, omni-
piesent, imminent, unshakable, a premonition
of danger ahead. It was the desire to com-
plete his cargo and get away that had sent
Han, alone, to prey upon the camp of the
bushmen.
When at length all sound in the camp
ceased, and the hres, one by one, closed their
eyes under their lids of grey ashes, Han eased
himself in his seat like a tiger rising from
its lair. When another hour had passed and
he was certain the camp slept, he shuffled
noiselessly up. to a hut on the outermost
skirts of the village, stretched himself at full
length on the ground, and with his head in
the doorway listened to the breathing of the
occupants. His ears told him a man, a
woman and a child inhabited the hut; also
that the man slept nearest the door, ns was
the bushman’s custom. Han wriggled on his
belly to the man’s side, hissed once, sharply
into his ear, and rested the sharp point, of a
knife against his chest, at the same time
gripping his arm. In five minutes they were
well away from the camp, fighting their way
through the steaming jungle back to the junk.
Back on the miasma-ridden river, Han
thrust his captive into the foetid false ’tweeu-
decks, and ordered the junk to be cut away
from its moorings on the bank. Then he
fell where he stood, and slept. Until the
Russian schooner in the far-away Yellow
Sea should be reached, there would be little
for him to do unless misfortune should befall
them.
While Han snored, open-mouthed and un-
beautiful, under the light of the late-rising
moon, the junk, hugging the shore, drifted
slowly down-stream. There were no lights.
Lights were not necessary where the only
seamanship required of the helmsman was
ability to keep the craft from running on
to the bank. But that helmsman needed ears.
He needed the best pair of ears in China.
On his hearing depended his life and the
lives of his companions. Down-stream, out
of sight and far in advance of the junk,
four men rowed along, singing at the top of
their voices. By constant concentration the
steersman on the junk could pick up
the sound. The songs they sang did
not matter, nor did the tune in which
they sang them. But should those
songs cease, the listener on the junk knew
♦danger to be at hand, and sent up a prayer
to his joss that the distance between his
craft and the singers would give him suffi-
cient time to run the junk on to the bank,
land his captives and hide in the jungle till
he couJd secure a fresh craft to take the
place of the deserted vessel which the men
of the coastguard would burn as a matter
of course. Should time not permit of this
schedule being followed, then the slaves must
be abandoned along \yith the boat, while the
crew went overboard to sink or swim. Run-
ning the ivory was a hazardous game, and
the man who came through safely reckoned
the high price he received for his cargo small
enough for the risks he took.
The singers were in good voice, and their
voices made sweet music to the listening
steersman. To him came also other voices
of the night; and through it all, continuous
and unnerving, a volume of sound like the
lowing of distant cattle rose up from the
sweltering ’tween decks, where the captives,
elbow to elbow, facing each other knee be-
tween knee, sat huddled and stifling, moan-
ing and calling upon death to descend and
lift them out of their pit of horrors. But
to these cries the helmsman gave little heed.
During the long days’ and interminable
nights’ run down the river they had gradu-
ally become part of his life. Even had they
ceased he would still have heard them. He
heard them in his' sleep; and in his dreams
he saw the torture-racked faces looking sky-
ward when one of the crew, a can fastened
to the end of a long stick, passed food and
drink along the huddled ranks in the human
cesspool. The sight of one of them, less
hardy than his fellows, being di-awn up to
the decks by means of a lasso thrown over
his head, to lx* tossed overboard, no longer
had any effect upon the steersman who saw
so much.
Came the last night of the long run. • Less
than eight hours’ journey ahead the Russian
captain, his pockets bulging with real money,
awaited the coming of the junk. Too ner-
vously anxious to trust the duty to his crew,
Han Yu, his palms itching for the feel of the
abundance of money, took the helm in person.
Once out in the swell of the Yellow Sea, he
would trust no hand but his own to bi'ing the
ungainly junk to rest alongside the block,
towering bulk of the Russian recruiter. The
cargo for which he had sweated blood was
too precious to risk in the hands of an un-
imaginative yellow boatman.
Far ahead down the stream the rowers
sang on. The end of their labors in sight
put new zest into their voices, so that Han,
listening from his place at the helm of the
junk, smiled contentedly into the night. At
the mouth of the river he would pick up the
singers, and make a last dash for his goal.
As the rowers pushed on a something
black and silent shot out suddenly from the
bank between them and the junk. Before
they saw it, or before they would have
realised its purport if they had seen it, it
was upon them. Quickly if ranged alongside
their boat; a dai'k figure leaned ovei'side, a
revolver was thrust hard up against the ribs
of the leading rowei*, and a voice, cold and
flinty, addressed the singers.
“Sing, you swine, sing ! Louder ! Louder!
At the top of your voices! And may Heaven
help you if you stop !”
Listening back on the junk Han smiled
at the rowers’ fresh effort and was content.
Approaching the mouth of the river, Han
ordered the signal which was to call the
boatmen back —the showing three times of a
purple-colored lantern on the deck of the
junk. Then he waited, praying that the wind
would freshen for the final dash to safety.
But the singers did not come back. Instead,
they ‘continued right on, and they sang louder
than Han had ever known them to sing be-
fore. Jumping up and down on the deck Han
cursed them for madmen, and ordered the
signal repeated. But the singing went on.
If anything it grew louder. And every
minute the mouth of the river and possible
detection drew nearer.
Fuming and cursing, Han put the helm
hard over as the junk took the first roll of
the ocean, setting his course for the spot
where the Russian lay in waiting, determined
to leave the imbecile singers to their fate.
Ten minutes went by, then ten more, and at
the end of a third ten Han saw that the
singers were still with him, an even distance
ahead, and singing as boisterously as before.
Worse than all, they were setting a course
straight for the waiting recruiter. Then
fear gripped Han’s heart. His lips turned
cold, and his hand trembled on the tiller. The
premonition of catastrophe which had crept
over him in the jungle returned and clawed
at his heart, and he knew that an unnamable
Horror hovered in the blackness in front.
Panic-ridden, he whimpered aloud in his fear
and put the helm hard over once again, just
as a blinding Hash split the night on his port
bow, and a shell whined across his course,
calling on him, in the name of the Govern-
ment, to give up that which to the Govern-
ment belonged.
A week longer than the pre-arranged time
the Russian waited for Han Yu ; then, re-
membering the hazardous nature of the enter-
prise in which the yellow man was engaged,
lie swore volubly and sat down to wait a
further seven days. When three weeks had
passed without anything more substantial
than a school of curious porpoises approach-
ing his vessel, he cursed all foreigners, and
yellow foreigners in particular, lifted his
anchor, and pointed the nose of his empty
ship towards home. But even then he did not
abandon all hope. There was work to be
done, savage men’s work, in his country up
the coast, and healthy Chinamen were bring-
ing a high figure. Finding himself watched,
Han Yu might be lurking along the coast
awaiting a favorable opportunity to sneak
out and deliver his cargo. Setting his course
inshore, the Russian searched the coast
through his glasses. At the mouth of the
Yellow River his judgment was vindicated,
and he found Han Yu. He picked him up
just as the sun rising out of the ocean threw
its first golden light on the frowning shore.
On top of a little knoll, clearly limned against
the background of the morning sky, Han,
along with half a dozen of his companions,
swung gently back and forth from a gibbet,
so many giant pendulums fanned by the
morning breeze.
