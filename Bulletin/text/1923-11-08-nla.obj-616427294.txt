“The Unconscious”
This very readable book, The Unconscious,
by Israel Levine, published by Leonard Par-
sons, London, while professing to be merely
an introduction to the .Freudian hypothesis,
is yet far more. It not only gives Freud’s
ideas in language which has been accepted
as accurate by himself, but it traces the his-
tory of the unconscious mind in philosophy,
through the work of Leibnitz, Schopenhauer,
Nietzsche and Samuel Butler. It goes back
to the mysticism of Spinoza, who has had so
vast an influence upon modern thought.
What, then, is this Freudian “uncon-
scious”? Does it exist at all? It is simply
a hypothesis of Freud to explain certain
facts of psychic life; certain instincts; cer-
tain dreams; lastly, and perhaps mostly,
memory itself. Freud does not lay it down
as a dogma; it has been left for his follow-
ers to do so. He has all along been most
cautious, truly scientific, in his outlook.
Freud’s unconscious contains thoughts of
a definite dynamic character which do not
reach consciousness, in spite of their de-
finiteness and intensity. Unconscious ideas
are largely conative —“desiring,” illogical,
timeless, wordless, and do not admit of any
doubt. The unconscious is in the happy
position of having no doubts about anything.
It might be a chemical reaction for all its
certainty. These features of the unconscious
largely resemble what we should otherwise
call “instincts.” There are certain
primitive instincts which appear to be
inborn, such as those requisite for the pre-
servation of the individual and for the pro-
pagation of the species. These are the ego-
instincts and the sex-instincts. Society will
not permit these to be indulged so freely as
the individual might like, so they are re-
pressed into his unconscious, and though they
are constantly striving to reach the surface
— i.e., consciousness—they can only do so
through a stage called by Freud the pre-
cc-nscious. But they are warped out of all
recognition in the process; they reach con-
sciousness as the famous “symbols” of which
the psycho-analysts have made so much—by,
apparently, interpreting them according to
their own sweet will, so far as one can see.
'As for consciousness itself, it appears to
be an organ of the mind, so to speak, which
enables us to receive sense-impressions, to
interpret them, and to translate them into
appropriate action. It is probably a mode
of functioning of nervous tissue, and is said
to reside in the mind, of which the seat is
supposed to be in the fore-brain. But I re-
member a young girl who was kicked by a
horse; she had to lose a great part of the
front of her brain because it went septic.
Instead of being transformed into an idiot,
she at tonce went to the top of her class as
if the operation had actually done her good.
The only results that appeared were con-
stant and dreadful headaches, so that per-
haps, after all, she would have been better
dead. And the essence of Freud’s doctrine is
that “conscious” is not synonymous with
“mental.”
But doctors, who have been for so long
accustomed to see if living phenomena can
be explained by bio-chemistry, were not
likely to sit down under this calm attempt
to introduce what might almost be called
metaphysics into medicine; and they called
upon the ductless glands to supply the de-
ficiency. It is from these that we get our
hormones, which have so much to do with
forming our characters. The genital glands
have at least a great deal to do with deter-
mining our sexual instincts. The adrenal
bodies have a great deal to do with maintain-
ing our blood-pressure at its proper level.
The pituitary body has a great deal to do
with deciding whether we are to be men of
ordinary size or giants. The thyroid gland
will determine whether we are to be cretins
or intelligent. It is in these mysterious
glands and their internal secretions that we
may find the true" unconscious of Freud.
They are all controlled by that part of the
nervous system which we eall “autonomic”
or vegetative, which is probably the oldest in
point of evolution of all the nervous system,
A.nd if we admit all this to be the real ex-
planation of Freudism, what becomes of
psychology as a separate science? Does it
not rather relegate it to an extension of ordi-
nary physiology?
Freud has always insisted on the vast im-
portance of sexual impulses in determining
conduct, and it is this that has so horrified
English people, who hate to think that a
bishop, say, is descended from an ape. Eng-
lish psychologists have made every effort to
show 7 that Freud did not mean what he said;
that really he intended sex to include almost
every branch of human behavior, from natu-
ral affection to a bountiful harvest. But Mr.
Levine is under no such illusion. He ruth-
lessly draws the curtain across all such
pretty dreams. To him sex means exactly
what it means to other sensible men. He
draws his analogy from the hypothesis of
Weismann, which holds that the body is
divided into two sections, the somato-plasm,
or body cells, and the germ-plasm, or germ-
cells. The body may die, but the seed never
dies; that is the essential difference between
the two, and that is why the sex-instinct
differs from all the other ego-instincts. Thus
the bishop has within him some of the actual
germ-plasm of his ancestor whom “Bloody
Mary” felt constrained to burn for a heretic;
and it is going on into every little bishop
to whom he gives life in sccula seoulorum.
In that sense Bloody Mary’s heretic can
never die, but must always live, though be-
coming halved at each generation for ever:
because halving a thing, even if for ever, can
never actually destroy it. And, though the
germ-plasm consists of only a few cells, while
the body contains untold millions, yet thase
few influence the many more than the many
influence the few, because they are immortal.
Are we not already becoming mystical? Or
incomprehensible, which is almost the same
thing?
And Freud does not admit that there is
any “herd instinct,” upon the existence of
which so many of us have p’aced our hopes
of future improvement for the race; for if
the instinct of man is not to become peace-
able and good, rather than to turn wolfish
and evil, what hope is there left for man-
kind? Does it not all rather induce us to
»o back to Plato, who, at least, had the ideas
of Truth, Beauty and Goodness, as synony-
mous with God? Dean Inge has done this,
clearly falling in with the general thought of
modern man; and doubtless that is the rea-
son of the extraordinary approval which has
greeted his thoughts. And if we go a little
further to Spinoza, embracing a whole-
Pantheism, it seems rather in accord-
ance with a great deal of modern scientific
thought; for what is matter but a form of
electricity, the most spiritual and ethereal
thing we can conceive? And Einstein says
that his conception of physics can get along
perfectly well without ether, which, after all,
cannot be conceived other than “the nomina-
tive of the verb to undulate.” If this is not
mysticism I really do not know what it is.
But we must remember that Freud does not
make a dogma out of his unconscious. It is
merely a hypothesis which he himself com-
pares to the hypothesis of the ether in
physics; and no doubt some medical Ein-
stein will arise—indeed, has arisen—to say
that he can get along quite well without it.
To work out fully all the arguments pro and
con. Freud would take the whole of the
Bed Page, and would lead us into regions
quite as dark as Freud’s unconscious; but
most of its contents can probably be found
in the hormones of the ductless glands.
Levine’s book, while concurring entirely
with Freud, at least states the arguments
for and against him, and is exceedingly
worthy of attention. We think we know
where the intellect is situated, but we do not
know where we can find Freud’s uncon-
scious ; equally certainly there is a vast area
of the brain whose faculties we do not know,
unless they are descended from some facul-
ties of palaeolithic man whose usefulness has
long since disappeared, or have somehow to
do with that mysterious thing “co-ordina-
tion.” Once more, Agnosco; Ido not know!

Shakspeare’s Unpleasantness
Strange! For more than three centuries
we have been acting, reading, talking and
writing about Shakspeare’s plays. For more
than three centuries we have criticised, com-
mented, edited and elucidated, until we really
thought we knew something about the plays,
if we still knew little or nothing about the
man. We could talk glibly about his powers
of characterisation, his philosophy, his wit,
his humor, his deep human insight and sym-
pathy, his broad realism, his lofty idealism,
his sheer poesy. But, it seems, we have all
been on the wrong track. We have consis-
tently failed to see the outstanding feature
of his work. It is only now, in this year
1923, the tercentenary of the first collected
edition of the plays, that certain wise men
have discovered that one all-important char-
acteristic—to wit, “unpleasantness.” One
pleasant-minded person declares that “Mea-
sure for Measure ’ is, “by universal consent,
the most unpleasant of all Shakspearean
plays.” Up jumps another. “Everyone to
his taste,” he cries, and plumps for “Titus
Andronicus.” A third, “since we are look-
ing for dirt in the classics,” suggests
“Pericles.” A fourth votes for “The Tem-
pest.” So, having at length found the right
spirit in which to approach the plays, it be-
hoves us to start our literary investigations
all over again.
In my ignorance I thought that “Titus
Andronicus” was a negligible quantity in the
discussion of Shakspeare’s plays. If Shaks-
peare had anything to do with it at all, it
was in his earliest apprenticeship. But I
see my error. Surely this was the child
Shakspeare’s first attempt at “unpleasant-
ness,” and a failure at that. Still in the
darkness, I believed that “Pericles” was
rather a good play, written by clever young
George Wilkins, whose w r ork Shakspeare con-
sidered worth touching up for the stage. But
now I find three complete scenes in it that
are Shakspeare’s. “It is,” says the para-
giaphist, “the first and most vital of all
the white-slave shockers, and the three scenes
laid in the business establishment of the
Mitylene Flossies have a wealth of Paphian
color that makes ‘Damaged Goods’ look
chaste **
And “The Tempest”! This play has
always been my favorite. I looked upon it
as the world’s most perfect dramatic poem,
a work of the most exquisite beauty, the most
consummate art. But in the midst of this
world of magic beauty lives —Caliban. I
had never noticed that Caliban besmirched
the pure beauty of “The Tempest.” I fan-
cied, rather, that his inclusion somehow em-
phasised that beauty. Whpn Benson pro-
duced the play he acted Caliban with an
almost tragic intensity, and certainly with-
out “unpleasantness.” Browning, with his
profound insight, saw into the tiny soul of
him, and produced therefrom one of the
finest, if not the very finest, of his “Dramatis
Personce.” Henry James speaks of “Ariel
and Caliban, and the island airs and island
scents, and all the rest of the charm and
magic, and the ineffable delicacy, a delicacy
positively at its highest in the conception
and execution of Caliban.”
I have never seen “Measure for Measure”
on the stage, but I have read it often. The
impression left with me is that of a soft,
white light shed upon—or is it not emanat-
ing from? —a picturepf perfect virgin purity,
Isabella. Melton Fisher’s picture of the
white-robed novice kneeling before the cruci-
fix, a flood of pure light from the cell-win-
dow falling upon the delicate, clasped hands
upraised in prayer and upon the sweet, de-
votional face, while in the dark background
stands the brown-cowled friar-duke with
hand upraised in blessing (“the hand that
made you fair hath made you good”), ap-
pealed to me as one of the very few Shaks-
pearean paintings worthy of their subject.
It is true that Shakspeare ■ heightens the
beauty of his saintly central figure by plac-
ing it in a sordid frame. 4mid all the de-
pravity and nastiness of a debased society,
the lustful hypocrisy of Antonio, the selfish
cowardice of Claudio and the grovelling beast-
liness of Mistress Overdone and her asso-
ciates, the sweet purity of Isabella shines
out unspotted. It is into her mouth that
the poet puts the fullest exposition of his
divine doctrine of Justice tempered with Mercy.
But all this is of no account. The essence

of the picture is in the sordid frame. The
men with the muck-rakes are so busy in
the kennel and the cesspit that they fail to
see the glory of the heavens. And the
modern paragraphist exclaims with the
shocked critic of a mediaeval Times : “Be-
yond any competition the most offensive play
in the English language.”
As in this new, delectable light we sur-
vey the rest of the plays, we shall find “un-
pleasantness” enough. All the Histories are
sufficiently “unpleasant,” and we must re-
store to Shakspeare the credit of having be-
fouled the purity of Joan of Arc. Falstaff,
deprived of the saving grace of illimitable
wit, is a “most unpleasant” person. “Merry
Wives of Windsor” stinks like the steaming
tuck-basket that plays so prominent a part
in it. In “All’s Well” the rather elderly
Helena chases and catches her unwilling
young husband in a “most unpleasant” way,
and her risqu6 conversation with Parolles is
much more than “most unpleasant.” As
early as “Love’s Labor’s Lost” Boyet talks
“greasily” to the ladies, and I sniff “unplea-
santness” even in “Hamlet.” At the end
the stage reeks like a shambles; and, in the
play-scene, the broad witticisms which Ham-
let addresses to Ophelia are almost as un-
pleasant as the suggestive innuendoes with
which the modern youth entertains his flap-
per friends.
And now we come to “Troilus and Cres-
sida.” Here is a play that has always
puzzled the critics. Some have sought to
explain and excuse; others have frankly
condemned. Some have seen in it a satire on
the degeneracy of the times; others a per-
sonal attack upon the “rival poet” Chap-
man or the morbid misanthropy of a mind
still clogged by the foul memory of a cer-
tain “dark lady” episode. Still others have
endeavored to prove it a contribution to the
famous “war of the theatres” or a satire
upon overdone Hellenism. All in the end
have given it up. Now, in the new light, all
is clear. “Troilus and Cressida” is Shaks-
peare’s supreme masterpiece in “unpleasant-
ness.” Not only has he chosen a particu-
larly nasty story; he has asserted the whole
strength of his genius in illuminating that
nastiness. Here Cressida is that “marvel
among Shakspeare’s creations”—a woman
merely base. Helen is “indistinguishable
from an orange-wench of the Restoration.”
And here, in “Troilus and Cressida,” we,
with our muck-rakes, unearth “the real
Shakspeare”—Shakspeare the vulgar Strat-
ford lout, clownish ignoramus, poacher, bully,
adulterer, profligate, hanger-on of the
theatres, vagabond player of small parts,
usurious lender of small coin. “Ha, ha!” he
laughs, “so you have found me. at last; you
who have studied your Hamlets and your
jProsperos so carefully, and thought you
'found me there! Hamlet, Prospero, for-
sooth! Mere dreamers of dreams, poor, meta-
physical fools! ’Tis not by dreaming that
'the playwright makes his pile. No, it is I,
Pander-Thersites, that am the true Shaks-
peare. My business is to attract the crowd
—the brave boys from Whitechapel and Bil-
lingsgate who pay their sixpences and want
their money’s worth. They like their amuse-
ments, like their food, coarse and strong.
Blood and blue —that’s what they want,
blood and blue, lust and gore; and I give it
to them, thick!”
Thus is the great authorship argument
settled for ever.
H. RUSSELL YOUNG.
Poetry and the Gossip-mongers
Mary Yeo (R.P. 18/10/’23) suggests that
the poets of Australia are neglected for want
of the sort of advertisement which goes to
the making of moving-picture stars. Her
idea is that if a lot of gossip about the so-
called personality of the writers gets into
print, the public will want to read their
verses. _ I gravely doubt whether there is one
writer in Australia who wants to find a pub-
lic on such terms; and I believe that the
theory itself is false. Two or three Austra-
lian writers have been very frequently re-
ferred to in the press, and their personalities
have become quite well known to the average
reader, without the sales of their work being
in any marked way increased.
The fact is that the modern gossip-monger
—though the gossip may be dished up with
a delicate literary flavor —is the foe of real
literary effort. All the personality of the
writer which the genuine reader wants to
find is in the writings themselves. The best
of the man is there—and the worst, too. It
is of the very nature of ink that it reveals
the inner thing which all the gossip in the
world could never touch. If I can know
the color of Milton’s mind I am quite content
to remain ignorant of the color of his socks;
yet if Milton’s aged socks were actually on
view in Sydney tens of thousands of people
would rush to see them, and not 1 per cent,
of all the crowd would open “Paradise Lost”
in consequence of the inspiring spectacle.
Anybody with the rudiments of literary
craftsmanship could write a book of gossip
of a thoroughly readable kind about the
poorest rhymester in Australia; and, if
properly done, that book would not be less
important as a piece of writing than one
written about our best. The advertisement
which comes from anything extraneous to his
own art is valueless to the poet and may be
injurious.
The poet more than anybody else in the
world puts himself on paper; and it is surely
reasonable to suppose that he puts as much
of himself there as he wishes the public to
have. What remains unsaid is his own
property, about which he has a perfect right
to be as little communicative as possible.
What Mary Yeo suggests is an infringement
of that right, on the ground that other people
know things much more interesting about
him than he himself tells. Everything there
must depend on the meaning of “interesting.”
No doubt there are a lot of things which will
interest the gossip-hungry which could be
written, but the point is that they are not
the things that interest the people the poet
himself wants to interest. No writer wants
the praise and applause of those who do not
and cannot appreciate his real work ; and the
writing about his personality or his socks
is merely an attempt to place his life-effort
in a false light. Certainly, anything that
directs the thoughts of those who may be
capable of understanding to something they
are missing is worth while, but personal
gossip is the worst way to direct them. Does
anyone suppose that the most generally en-
joyed tales about Victor Daley—tales which
pass from lip to lip in half the hotel bars or
Australia —have added to the number or
those who love his “Sunset Fantasy . ft
gossip about a charming and unusual per-
sonality counted Daley would long ago have
been hugged close to the heart of all Aus-
tralia, and- liis books would have sold in tens
of thousands. Australian writers may y®t
have to endure many things; but Mary leo s
proposal that they should be compelled to
endure floods of tittle-tattle in order to secure
a public is a little too unpleasant to seri-
ously contemplate.
C. O. M.
The Nude and Other Things
“Pictor” on some Art problems:—
Leslie Wilkie was not, as stated (B. 27/9/’23),
runner-up to Meyer Altson in competition for the
Travelling Scholarship. That honor was gained by
John Hennessy, a sound painter who, having turned
his energies into a particular channel and ceased
to exhibit in the ordinary way, is in danger of
being forgotten. In those days competition was
keen; in this instance there were eight entries and
the judges placed four pictures: George Bell cart e
third, A. M. E. Bale fourth. There exist the four
photographs taken for publication but not published,
the reason probably being that Altson’s winning
picture, “The Leisure Hour,” included a model in
a costume near enough to “the altogether ’ (though
still a long way off it) to be thought unsuited for
general publication, and it was obviously impossible
to reproduce the other three without it.
The Herald plebiscite taken at the European
exhibition, in placing first Gerald Kelly’s nude,
“Siesta,” seems to indicate a change in the public
attitude towards the nude as such. That very stale
red herring so constantly drawn across the trail in
the everlasting Norman Lindsay dispute, the pel -
sistent and wilful assumption that his assailants
(artist or lay) are merely objecting to the nude
as such and are therefore wowsers—how very tired
it makes us! Over and above their weakness of
drawing (now further attested by some English
painters of standing), what is hateful in these pro-
ductions is their deliberate choice of evil types
and salacious circumstance, and the insipidity that
engulfs every form meant to typify any higher feel-
ing. Drapery, or the want of it, is an irrelevant
matter—nothing to the point. Whatever claim be
made for the rights of art to all subject-matter
under the sun, nothing—since man is a thinking
animal —can annul the intellectual significance of
things. While this is so, there must be right and
wrong, clean and unclean, wholesome and vitiated.
Art appeals to the intellect as well as to the eye:
so far as it is imitative it must have an intellectual
significance. Therefore, it is disputable whether
such optical impressions as cannot be consciously
noted are a fair field for the adventurers of Art.
William Clowes (B. 27/9/’23) points out the possi-
bility of freak cults arising by emulation of the
instantaneous photograph, with its revelation of
weird poses too rapid for the brain’s concurrence
with the eye. The sense of movement can only be
conveyed by a pose combining the last attitude with
the coming one, a portion of each retained. Only
art can do this: only thus can the mind grasp the
intention of the modelled or painted surface. Photo-
graphy can give only the momentary pose, and this
(so are the eyes made) cannot render movement.
Hence the frozen immobility, the gruesome inertia
of photographed figures in rapid and vigorous motion.
A football-scrimmage photograph has a defunct
rigidity of form to make one shudder, There can be
no object in striving to depict what cannot be
recognised for truth by the beholder.
A Satchel of Books
Adventures in Golf is another collection of H.
M. Bateman drawings with a chuckle in every page.
All of those weird people who deal in stymies and
niblicks and things are going to get huge enjoyment
out of it, because each one will see every golfer
bar himself pilloried in it.
Figure Painting in Water-colors is the special
Spring mumber of the Studio, and features two dozen
pictures by contemporary British artists reproduced
in the usual admirable fashion of this house. An
interesting volume, particularly because of the wide
range of styles covered, and in spite of a fore-
word bv George Sheri ngham, which is like those
flowers of Spring that had nothing to do with the
case.
The Australian Museum Magazine keeps up its
high level in the October number. Of particular
interest are “The Mud Dwellers of Kaimari,” by
Allan McCulloch, who accompanied Hurley in Papua ;
“The Beachcomber and his Tropic Isle,” by Charles
Barrett, C.M.Z.S. ; and “A Dinosaur Exhibit,” a
finely informative article based on some notable
specimens obtained by exchange with the Museum
of Natural History, New York. All are finely illus-
trated.
Thomas Rowlandson, ITis Drawings and Water-
colors, by A. P. Oppe. Another sumptuous volume
turned out by the Studio. Sixteen reproductions in
color and about 80 in half-tone adequately epito-
mise Rowlandson’s tremendous output, and in his
acute monograph Oppe admirably sums up the erratic
genius and his art. He ends on this true note:
“His brain was in his pen. The trouble was that
as other draughtsmen allow their sense of decora-
tion or even the ealigraphic quality of their line to
dominate them, so Rowlandson was mastered by his
mere means of expression, and allowed' his great
powers as a realistic and fantastic draughtsman,
his sense of daintiness and charm which his humor
nearly always keeps from cloying, even the humor
itself, to be swamped in a mass of coarse and care-
less facility which is not even caricature because
what it over-expresses has no character.”
The Cuckoo in the Nest, by Ben Travers (John
Lane). A genuinely humorous novel —for those who
like its brand of humor. Peter and Margaret are
old friends, and each is happily married to another.
They miss a train on the way to a house-party in
the country, and the exigencies of the ease (a bit
strained for the purpose) force them not only to
occupy the same room at a village pub but to be
seen in bed together by the landlady. All in the
completest innocence. Hichens, in “The Londoners,'
did similar farcical work 25 years ago; but though
the humor of Hichens is as good as that of Travers,
and cleaner, Travers’s sense of intrigue is far superior.
In fact, it is equal to that of anyone now writing
in English.
The Turning Sword, by G. V. McFadden (John
Lane). Another story of Miss McFadden’s favorite
early nineteenth century. There is a great advan-
tage in pitching your tale in a bygone time: it
hypnotises the ordinary reader, who thereafter makes
no serious demand for probabilities—he knows he
wouldn’t do this or that, but he can’t swear his
great-grandfather wouldn’t. The old man of “The
Turning Sword” had an early adventure and a son;
the lady in the case died and he thought the son
died too (so he says). Anyway, he adopts another
infant; the two grow up into vastly different young
men, and when a girl throws one ,elver for the other
there’s good material for a duel. The story runs
lightly over the surface of things, easily read and
quite easily forgotten.
Sir John Dering, by Jeffery Farnol (Sampson
Low, Marston). There is good work as well as
a flood of incident and color in this romantic comedy
of the days when Sussex was the smuggler’s paradise
and the young blood of the period was liable to have
to work overtime to fit in all his duels. The sober
historian would tell another tale; but at least you
don’t want to finish a 400-page sober history at a
sitting, as you probably will want to this romance.
It is written with so confident a pen, too, that it
won’t occur to you to doubt the wonders which
Jeffery Farnol calls upon his puppets to perform.
Afterwards you may have doubts whether there
ever was such a person as the Lady Herminia ; but
Farnol will have scored his point as long as he
makes you believe in her at the moment, and he is
quite capable of doing it.
The Story of an Athlete, by H. C. Harrison
(McCubbin, Melbourne). Mr. Harrison begins his
yarn with the arresting phrase, “I am as old as
Melbourne”; and the rest of the book is nearly as
good as that. He was at Bendigo for the beginning
of the gold rush and at Ballarat during the Eureka
Stockade affair, but most of his life has been lived
in Melbourne, as a Customs official. He is chiefly
known to sporting fame as “the Father of Australian
football,” but he seems to have distributed his in-
terests fairly between football, cricket (he has been
vice-president of the M.C.C. for 30 years), boxing
and bicycling. At his physical best he could run
100 yards in “evens,” and at the age of 62 he push-
hiked from Melbourne to Sydney to see a Test match,
taking 9| days over the trip, and doing an average
of 63 miles a day. There is a charm about some
of these reminiscences of our pioneers—a fragrance
that has nothing to do with art but everything to
do with sincerity.
Ch/ina in the Family o|jf Nations, by Henry T. Hodg-
kin (George Allen and Unwin). A sympathetic
study by one with 20 years’ experience of the land
he discusses. His distrust of the Japanese is as
profound as his liking for the Chinese, and his chap-
ters on “Japan in China” should be read by every
Australian pacifist who really believes that, assum-
ing Australia apppears desirable in Japanese eyes,
that ambitious and aggressive nation can be held
at bay by ethical appeals. The guild system,
which still keeps most of China socially and economi-
cally where Europe was. in the Middle Ages, is
alleged by Mr. Hodgkin to be fast breaking down.
If this is so, and the industrialisation of the nation
is begun on Japanese lines, the Commonwealth, for
one, will automatically be faced with a most dis-
turbing problem. The book is full of suggestive
viewpoints, frankly put, and will be of particular
value to Australians who desire to know how their
country stands in reference to awakening Asia.
Dora Wilcox on art and Puritanism: —
It is hardly possible for anyone who has lived in
London since the war—not as a casual visitor, but
as an inhabitant—to read “Whitehall’s” remarks
anent the Australian Art Exhibition without a cer-
tain amusement. That fierce Puritanism which, he
declares, is at the base of every true Britisher’s
character, and is the key to many of his actions, no
doubt is still there, and ready to wake at any
moment; but at present it is sleeping very soundly.
London, in fact, was far less likely to be shocked
by Norman Lindsay than Sydney: it has seen so
much undress —in Art, in Literature, above all, in
Life! Orpen may be an “idealistic Irishman,”' Sims
“an English painter of intensely moral nudes,” but
both are far too well aware of all that is happening
around them to be very likely to find Lindsay ab-
horrent on moral grounds. But “Whitehall” is un-
consciously right when he brings Byron into the
question. Present-day Continentals accord Byron as
high a place in English literature as did Taine him-
self, and they are still convinced that it is prejudice,
and prejudice alone, that prevents certain English
critics from fully recognising his genius. Is it true ?
Surely not now —though undeniably it used to be—
when Shelley’s “Cenei” is performed publicly with-
out protest, and “Don Juan” seems tame and dully
respectable in comparison with the productions of
many a lass of 20. No ; it is not his life nor his
opinions which keep Byron from coming into what
so many Frenchmen and Germans believe to be his
own. There is something more. He had fire and
passion and independence of thought, and a great
imagination—where subject was concerned. He was
a Romantic, of that great and glorious tradition
which produced Dickens also; and Norman Lindsay,
born out of time. Romanticism is not dead, any
mor than p ur it a nism • but both have been dormant

J ac k Lindsay replies to a critic .
I see that in “8.C.F.” (R.P. 25/10/’23) we

of the animal called the “moral lion” (the phrase
is Nietzsche’s), and I must thank him for the

on that sh l r 1 1 " e °/ master of all fiee spirits.
First, it will be obvious to everyone, except b.l.d.

1 , 1 ’ , ... , ~ i ,„ fpvp
seeks to degrade life to the equality of souls beto
God. Of course he mocks the cowardly desire for
social utopias (“when one has one’s wherefore of
life, one gets along with almost every h0w....
Man does not strive after happiness: only the
Englishman does so”). Of course he deifies only
all that seeks strength, passion, laughter, grace,
Of course he robs “8.C.L.” of all significance....
it is in the personal application of this doctrine
that Nietzsche's value lies; only obliquely does he
touch social constructions. Finally I must thank
“8.C.L.” for taking Tolstoi as the antithesis of
Nietzsche- For Tolstoi is the basest mentality that

SHIP BRAND
Cornflour
is such a favourite with the wise and fastidious cook.
Innumerable inviting dishes suitable to tempt difficult summer
appetites have this superfine light flour as a base.
Are you aware that the white corn from which Ship Brand
is made, is rich in vitamines, containing the elements essential
for balanced nutrition, and it is also easily digested ? All the
wholesome goodness that Nature Stores in the cobs the
delicate sweetness that sunshine gives, comes to you in
delectable form in the Ship Brand packet.
Whenever a recipe calls for Cornflour, use Ship Brand and
substitute it for ordinary wheat flour in soups, sauces, gravies,
special cakes, etc., and you will find them decidedly improved
both in texture and flavour.

While the shrill winds pass
Between the stars and the sea
I shall walk over grass.
And the grass shall walk over me. ...
The grass blind to the light
And the wind with no ear;
And the day kissing the night
That holds it not dear!
Always the dead thing to live
And the living thing to die;
And an answer the world may give
To the question, “What am I?”
Hauntingly near and far,
Between the wind and the grass,
Between the sea and the star
As I listen and pass!

The pale wistaria droops silver buds,

And capeweed. riots where the river floods.

In Spring Love only lives:
His little life doth pace
The round one season gives,
Then, weary, hides his face
Between his handies twain,

How his true servants strain
Their strength and wit to be
Securely his, through pelf;
Yet is it right that they,
E’en more than Hate himself,
Should sweat and swink, to pay. . .

Irony.
I hated her, she was so dear to me.
Who came between me and serenity!
Soft-stepping, shod
Surely with roses, that her light feet trod
Into my heart so elfin-daintily!
4
Her lips were tremulous, ’twixt pale and red,
Half-parted, as for some sweet word unsaid !
I do not know T
What malice mocked me that I loved her so,
Yet hating her till my wrung heart-strings
bled!
I saw beneath firm flesh and silkdti skin
The tawdry soul, drugged with insipid sin,
That knew not Love!
How wrought God w T ith me—He who sits
above
Meshing our souls in nets His fingers spin!
I hated her; and so I stole awrny
Out of her life, long since. Yet, who can say
What God's will is?
My lips still hunger for one lost wild kiss
From those poor sin-stained, trembling lips
to-day!

Mountain Fires.
The fire king came down to the valley,
attended
By pomp that no monarch shall ever be-
hold.
Red jewels agleam in his canopy splendid,
And billows of flame in his pathway un-
rolled,
While out on the hills, over earth that was
parching,
Through shuddering trees went his myriads
marching
With banners of purple and torches of
gold.
Here and there on the hills, through the
smoke drift uprisen,
A tree stood aloft like a glittering spire;
And waratahs, caught in their shadowy
prison,
Blazed out for a moment like roses of fire.
Then the fickle wind turned and, too eager
to dally,
The mad swirl of flames rushed away to the
valley
In fury of strong and unsated desire.
They gathered fresh forces, they rolled like
a river
That tosses all else in its pathway aside;
The slender trees swayed from their coming,
aquiver,
And paused for the space of a heart-beat
and died.
Oh, it seemed that the universe, wholly for-
saken,
By gods in their wrath had been conquered
and taken
And plunged in red torrents unfathomed
and wide.
The fire king has passed; and the heavens all
starlit
Smile down as of old on the dim forest
rills;
The morning walks splendid in opal and
scarlet,
But life that it calls for awakes not nor
thrills.
Ah. we who have known of the far-reaching
splendor,
The purple of noon and the grey dusk and
tender,
Are sad for the sake of the desolate hills!

MENTAL DEFECTIVES AND THE
LAW.
An American doctor recently inquired into
the cases of 11 children whose characters had
suddenly changed for the worse. From nor-
mal they had become violently quarrelsome,
cruel, destructive and sexually depraved. He
discovered that their symptoms were the
after-effects of epidemic encephalitis. In
Sydney last month another doctor carried
out certain tests on a dozen criminals rang-
in between 30 and 50 years of age. He
found that their mental age averaged about
eight years. It would have shocked even the
legal world had a suggestion been advanced
that the encephalitis victims should be
flogged or imprisoned; yet that is what we
are doing year in, year out, in Australia to
other unfortunates who are no more to
blame for the offences they commit. The
American children were temporary degen-
erates because they happened to “catch” en-
cephalitis ; the Australian gaolbirds are per-
manent morons for the reason, probably, that
their fathers or mothers happened to “catch”
syphilis. Morally speaking, it is a distinc-
tion without a difference.
*****
In every community there are unhappy
creatures who find it impossible to live up
to the standards of conduct which society
has prescribed for its own comfort or safety.
The normal human being, even when grossly
wronged, does not, as a rule, so much as
think of murder; or, anyhow, not in a Brit-
ish State where this crime is particularly
reprobated. If the thought does occur, it is
immediately dismissed. In a flash, the
wronged one has seen, with his disciplined
mind’s eye, the corpse, the embarrassments
associated with its disposal; then discovery,
arrest, trial, conviction, sentence and ruin.
The mental degenerate leaps all the stages
between the onset of rage and the act which,
so far as he is concerned, is the inevitable
result of rage. More especially does this
apply in sexual matters. It is many years
since investigators of all nationalities —
Havelock Ellis, Lombroso, Kraeft-Ebing
to the satisfaction of the
civilised world that the victims of certain
sexual aberrations are as incapable of resist-
ing when emotional storms strike them as
they are of quelling elemental storms. Their
lack of any sense of responsibility, shame,
decency or dread of consequences is as
complete, during the only moments which
matter, as that of the children already re-
ferred to, or of the adult convicts who are
still children mentally. This important truth
has percolated almost everywhere save to
those regions in which it is most desirable
for it to be accepted—the law courts and the
Bench.
* * * *
The law is often revealed as an extremely
radical force. In interpreting the position
of trade unions, for example, it has been
ahead of contemporary public opinion many
a time during the past half-century. But
where any one of its own conventions or
privileges is trenched on its conservatism is
rigid and its hostility to the advocates of
change unrelenting. A remarkable scene
occurred during the Epping Forest murder
trial between Justice Darling and the
famous mental specialist Sir Robert Arm-
strong Jones. The doctor testified that the
accused was insane when he committed his
crime; the Judge said, in effect, that his
profession had nothing to do with theories
about gusts of temporary insanity. “We take
the law here.” he said, “from the Bench,
and not from Harley-street.” This exclusive-
ness, amounting to a scandalised annoyance
that members of another profession should
poach on their preserves, is the traditional
attitude of the legal fraternity wherever it is
suggested that medical psychiatrists should
give the Bench the benefit of their special
knowledge. It is a wrong attitude, if not
from the standpoint of pure law, then cer-
tainly from that of justice and the common
good. A frequent characteristic of crimes
committed by abnormal persons is that they
are abnormally revolting. The victims are
often children; sometimes, as in the Puddi-
foot case, mere babies. The “stunt press”
inflames the public mind with “sob stories,”
photographs, etc., until by the time the per-
petrator faces a court he is widely regarded,
not as the pitiable imbecile he is, but as a
cold-blooded assassin of the deliberate
Deeming type. This puts the Judge in a
false position. He must either do what Jus-
tice Ferguson did with Puddifoot —proceed
according to the letter of the law and face
a hurricane of ignorant objurgation—or
strain after punitive action, which has no-
thing to do with either law or justice, but
is merely the outcome of a dread of public
obloquy. Plainly if the Judges took the
long view they would realise that the pre-
sence of a medical assessor on the Bench in
certain classes of cases would relieve them
and criminal juries of a responsibility which
laymen should not be required to assume,
while it would not derogate in the least from
their dignity. As for the public, the change
would give it a confidence in the courts
which is at present lacking. One of the
undesirable outcomes of the Puddifoot
horror has been the formation of a Vigilance
Society in the district where the crime
occurred, whose members propose to resort to
lynch law in future cases of assaults on
women or children.
At present a palpable degenerate who has
slain some inoffensive citizen in circumstances
which do not admit of a murder verdict may
be shut up for life as a criminal lunatic or
sentenced for manslaughter. The first penalty
is so severe that counsel are chary about
pleading insanity and juries about finding it.
while the second means that, after a brief
space of undeserved punishment, the pris-
oner will be at liberty to kill somebody else.
Assuming the law conceded the existence of
a third class of malefactor —one who was
neither a whole-time lunatic nor a whole-time
assassin, and who had a natural right to be
dealt with accordingly by the State —it is
indisputable that many wbo were outside the
new category would endeavor to get into it
when faced with trouble. The job of the
medical psychiatrist would be inter alia to
decide between the true and the false in
this connection. Under this system a
Crippen or a Deane —sordid murderers of
the clear-headed, reasoning type—would get
their deserts, and half-witted slaves of
impulse would not be let loose on the
public, after a farcically short period of
seclusion, to perpetrate fresh infamies next
time their uncontrolled brains go awry. The
complement of the doctor on the bench is an
institution to which accused persons could
be committed who have been found “unfit to
be at large.” Juries would have little hesita-
tion in sending the mildest of cases to such
a place, since the treatment would be cura-
tive, instead of punitive, and release no more
than a matter of a certified recovery ; and it
would provide the community with a guaran-
tee of safety which does not exist at present.
FINANCIAL SPECTRES AHEAD.
Australia is getting a closer view of big
financial trouble than it ever had before,
and the spectacle is far from pleasant. Nom-
inally it is Queensland’s trouble; but under
“the weakest Federation on Earth” the
States, with their control over railways and
public lands, and their stupendous debts, and
their stupendous areas, and the stupendous
cheek of their politicians, and their inde-
pendence of subdivision schemes, loom very
large in the financial world, while the Com-
monwealth looms rather small. There is not
one of the 48 United States—not even New
York or Pennsylvania or Illinois, and cer-
tainly not Rhode Island —whose bankruptcy
could be mistaken for the bankruptcy of
Uncle Sam in general, while the financial
troubles of U.S. railways reflect on neither
the State nor the Union. But there is no
mainland State here whose default wouldn’t
be taken, in many quarters, for a general
Australian breakage, and produce many of
the effects of one. The incident of the
moment is that the Theodore Government has
to go to the British market because some
£25,000,000 of loans are falling due, and,
after the usual Australian fashion, there is
not much more than 25 pence of real money
available to pay with. And the British
market doesn’t in the least want to be gone
to by the Theodore Government, though it
may put the business through at a price as
the legs of two evils. In fact, it would rather
be approached by almost anybody but Theo-
dore. Australia, now that the old loans are
coming home to roost in shoals, stands on
the edge of partial default as often as five
times or more in a year. But this last home-
coming fowl is a special bird, by reason of
the fact that Theodore has done almost
everything possible to embitter his creditor
in advance.
* * * *
The fact that the British money market’s
objection to Queensland is really a well-
founded objection to Theodore, and a deep-
rooted suspicion as to what that helter-
skelter financial ignoramus may do next, im-
plies that the State might get much better
conditions if the ex-trades union organiser
sacrificed himself politically for the public
good. The people in England know pretty
well that he doesn’t represent Queensland
public opinion, of which they have no par-
ticular doubt or suspicion; but as he has
secured a big majority of seats with a big
minority of votes, and is apparently cap-
able of repeating the operation indefinitely,
Queensland must pay for him. As a finan-
cier no one has ever said anything worse
of him than that he knew nothing and knew
it worse than anybody else. Under his rule
the richest of the six States secured the
lowest place for railway earnings, the lowest
for area under cultivation in proportion to
population, the lowest for progress in manu-
factures, and the lowest for the size of the
worker’s share of factory output. It became
lowest save one for its contribution per head
to the common or Federal fund, and lowest
save two for savings-bank deposits per head.
But it secured top place for State taxation
per head, top place for unemployed, and top
place but one for debt. All the savings-
bank funds to which the State Government
has access (and it made a remark-
ably good bargain in this respect when it
handed over the liabilities of the concern to
the Commonwealth) are represented by the
State’s unsecured lOU. Almost all the
assets of the State Insurance Department
are also represented by the State’s unsecured
lOU : in fact, the finding of loan money for
the Theodore Government seems a main
purpose of the institution. But incapables
bave been so frequent in public finance that
all these matters might have been got over.
It was in his lofty attitude as a twister of the
lion’s tail that Theodore came to serious grief.
He required money. He required still more to
do something to vindicate his standing with
the crowd he and Ryan had trained as an
implacable enemy of capital who needed capi-
tal badly. So the leases of the State’s big-
pastoral tenants were broken and their
rents raised out. of sight; and while the
Government thus gained the applause of
those who are prepared to enjoy any highway
robbery if only the robbed are reputedly rich, it
got some money out of a class which was
supposed to be rich, and which was remark-
ably helpless because it had either
to pay or to abandon the fortunes
it had buried in improvements. Un-
fortunately a good many British investors
were involved, and they weren’t favorably
impressed, as Theodore’s pet Bolsheviks
were, by this striking essay on the non-
sanctity of oaths and bargains. These in-
vestors refuse to be impressed even now by
the passionate declaration that the steal was
a matter of purely internal policy, with
which no outsider has a right to interfere,
and that outside interference, or even com-
ment, is an outrage on Queensland’s self-
governing rights. They say that when in-
ternal policy comes to include the internal
plundering of external people, then the
alleged internalness of the policy becomes an
impudent and muddy joke.
* * * *
If, then, Theodore and the London money
market part company over the £25,000,000
loan it will doubtless be with a pleasing
conviction that the Commonwealth (that is
to say, the other States), and Prime Minis-
ter Bruce, and the Prime Minister’s spats
must throw themselves into the breach after
some fashion or other to avert a catastrophe.
Where the States are so big, and the State
debts are so vast, and the Commonwealth is
so helpless to prevent any and every State
adventurer from pawning its subjects to the
last copper, there is always danger of a
catastrophe. The Constitution makes large
provision in a general way by which the
Commonwealth may come to the aid of a
burst or partially-burst State, or even six
burst States, but gives it no definite autho-
rity to prevent the disaster, or to put in a
receiver when the smash happens. These
are misfortunes; and they are none the less
misfortunes because the Commonwealth has
acquired the loan-land-settlement craze itself
and joined in the jig. The desire that the
policeman should have wider powers to sup-
press drunkenness may be legitimate; but
when it is discovered that that zealous officer
is almost as tight as anybody else, the situa-
tion becomes rather complicated. Unfor-
tunately Robert’s insobriety doesn’t solve
the problem; it only makes it a more serious
one for the sane portion of the community to,
tackle.
THE KU KLUX KLAN.
The Ku Klux Klan, as the United States
now knows it, was organised October 26,
1915, in Atlanta, Georgia, by William
Joseph Simmons. Simmons was once an
itinerant Methodist exliorter; at another
time Professor of Southern History at Lanier
University, a small, newly-organised college
in Atlanta; at another time, “solicitor” of
members for the Woodmen of the World,
a fraternal organisation. On Oct. 26, 1915,
he and 33 friends signed a petition to the
Superior Court of Fulton County, Georgia,
for a charter as a fraternal secret order. It
was granted July 1, 1916. Already the Klan
is active in every State of the Union, with
the doubtful exception of three. It has a
membership of over 500,000. But its chief
stronghold is still the southern States. In
Atlanta, Georgia, the place of its birth, it
meets in a made-over sewer.
When it was organised it was directed
against the negro. In this it claimed to be
a revival of the old Kvi Klux Klan of the
reconstruction period which followed the
Civil War. Such a menace to democratic
institutions did the original Klan become
that Congress outlawed it and soon put it
out of business. To-day the negro lias be-
come a side-issue; the Klan is also aimed
against Jews, Roman Catholics, aliens and
labor organisations. In certain parts of
America certain of these elements are
stronger than in other parts, and there you
will find the Klan directing its secret forces
against that particular element. For in-
stance, in California the Japanese and Jabor
organisations find chief place in the Klan's
plans. In the southern States the negro and
the R.C. occupy that place. In the North the
Klan is not very strong, and while each of
these classes comes in for condemnation no
serious clashes have taken place so far. In
Chicago an organisation has sprung up with
the object of fighting the Klan, and a num-
ber of wealthy Jews and Catholics are said
to be supporting it. In September, 1921, a
great “drive” against the organisation was
opened by a number of American newspapers,
headed by the New York World. Later the
Hearst chain of papers took up the fight.
It was hard hit; but, as will be seen pre-
sently, there is one very strong reason for
keeping it alive.
The Klan has a comical array of names
for its officials. The head styles himself
Imperial Wizard. Until recently this title was
held by Simmons ; but Simmons resigned
(after making himself wealthy) and Im-
perial Kleagle Young took over the job. The
Imperial Wizard rules over an "Invisible
Empire,” and to his “subjects” he is “Em-
peror.” Then there are Kleagles and King
Kleagles, Goblins and Grand Goblins. A
Kleagle is a salesman or solicitor for Ku
Klux membership on a commission basis.
They hawk, as one man puts it, a mixture
of equal parts of pseudo-romantic mystery
and plain prejudice and hatred. King
Kleagles are in charge of these membership-
peddling forces in specified districts. Goblins
and Grand Goblins are higher up in the In-
visible Empire, and well on the way to be-
come Emperor. Simmons copyrighted his
ritual; in the Library of Congress anyone
can now read the mass of fantastic rubbish.
The Emperor also addresses “decrees” to
Exalted Cyclops (Klan presidents) and all
Klansmen. One reads as follows: “The
Kloran [the ritual referred to] is the Book
of the Invisible Empire, and is therefore a
sacred book with our citizens, and its con-
tents must be rigidly safeguarded... .The
book or any part of it must not be kept or
carried where any person of the ‘alien’ world
may chance to become acquainted with its
sacred contents as such.” In this Kloran
the meeting-place of the Klan is called a
Ivlavern. A lecturer or teacher of the Klan
is a Klokard, while a chaplain is a Kludd. A
treasurer is a Ivlabee and a secretary a
Kligrapp. A Ivladd is a conductor, Ivlarogo
the Inner Guard. Klexter the Outer Guard.
As to the Imperial Wizard himself, we are
told that he is “the Emperor of the Invisible
Empire, a wise man, a wonder worker, hav-
ing power to charm and control. From
Vita, to know.”
Before a candidate is admitted into the
Klan he must take the oath of allegiance.
Often this is administered in dramatic
fashion. Covered from head to foot in a
white robe, the candidate is taken to the out-
skirts of a town and is surrounded by a
band of Klansmen, also in their “night-
gowns.” In the centre is a cross of fire held
aloft, and before it the candidate kneels.
After the ritual is gone through the candi-
date is admitted, but he may be totally
ignorant of the names of his fellow-Klans-
men and may even be living in the same
house with one and not know it.
The Klan has been a great money-making
organisation. When a candidate joins he
makes a “donation” of 10 dollars., or about
£2. Of this the Kleagle keeps about 16s.
and sends the rest to his King Kleagle, who
pockets a dollar. The other pound goes into
the “Imperial” treasury. But that is not
all. The Klan owns the company which
manufactures the “nightgown” and hooded
cap. These, sold to members for about 255.,
cost only ss. to make. In five years the sales
of regalia and membership “donations”
amounted to one and a half million pounds.
But others besides the avaricious and the
simple are occasionally enrolled, and then
there is apt to be trouble. Two of the Klan’s
big officials a little while ago exposed the
methods and motives of the Klan. One of
them was Grand Goblin C. Anderson
Wright ; the other Captain Henry P. Fry,
who was Kleagle. Wright says that “at
heart this vicious organisation doesn’t care
particularly what it does, so long as the re-
venue is inviting.” “Its founders,” he says,
“or chief kidders, are not mad at any par-
ticular group or race, but its well-paid
Kleagles, or membership solicitors, anxious
to collect their own four dollars out of every
ten dollars ‘donation’ by new members, are
willing to be mad about any subject. Keen
judges of human nature, and hired only be-
cause of a ‘gift of gab.’ those inciters to
disorder agree with and foster any prejudice
or hatred discovered in the mind of a pros-
pective member in any vicinity. They ‘yes’
him thoroughly; add fuel to his hatred, and
pronounce the Ku Klux Klan the only pos-
sible salvation for him if he would see the
Jap banished, the Jew bankrupt, the Catho-
lic denied religious freedom., the negro put
back into virtual slavery, and all foreigners
prevented from making progress in this
country.”
Captain Fry. in withdrawing from the
Klan, addressed a letter to Emperor Sim-
mons, in which he made the following state-
ments : \
After five months of citizenship in the Invisible
Empire, three months of which were spent as a
Kleagle, I have reached the conclusion that your
proposition is an historical fraud ; that it is a
money-making scheme run for the benefit of a - few
insiders; that it is engaged in an evil propaganda
in promoting unwarranted religious and racial hatred
against negroes and foreign-born American citizens ;
that your entire scheme is a dangerous public menace
that will inevitably lead to bloodshed, and, if suc-
cessful, must result in revolution, and that, in th»
interest of decent Americanism, it should be sup
pressed by the Federal and State authorities....
Your whole “Invisible Empire’’ is a cancer on the
body politic. It is like some foul and loathsome
thing that grows and flourishes in the dark, away
from the sight of honest men and women. It was
conceived in avarice, sired in ignorance and damned
in greed....
There are, nevertheless, responsible per-
sons who defend the Ku Klux Klan with the
plea that it upholds American institutions


and makes for law and order. But demo-
cratic* institutions need no secret, nigh
riding bands to defend them, and as for law
and order the methods of the Ivlan aie a
direct challenge to everything those terms
imply.

PLAIN ENGLISH.
The Victorian Police Strike.
Thebe are ethical degrees in strikes, based
broadly on the damage they may do to the
helpless. On this reading a general strike
of doctors has always been accepted as a
truly Satanic notion. No less appalling, m
u city of nearly a million inhabitants, arc.
the possibilities' of a general police strike.
Organised society, like the norinal mdi-
vidual, is continually fighting its own
evil impulses, and in both cases the moment
the inhibitions are removed disaster results.
There is a superstition amongst the cruder
type of revolutionary propagandist that
policemen are the special friends of capital-
ism. and, of course, they are v to the extent
that one of their functions is to protect pro-
perty. Rut. as every revolution has shown
within a very few days, those who have most
to fear from the supersession of law by
anarchy are the poor. The course of events
is always the same. Rioting begins in the
wealthier quarters, and big shops are knocked
about and presently looted in a spirit of
irresponsibility, often not unconnected with
alcohol. Then the criminal element, realis-
ing its chance has come, docks to the killing.
At this stage the capitalist banks his cash,
barricades his place of business, and departs
to his usually distant suburban home. If
that is menaced he is in a position to send
his children and womenfolk away. The
poorer classes are obliged, for the most part,
to carry on as usual. The wives must re-
main at. home at the mercy of any thug or
degenerate who happens to call, and if the
children venture into the streets they face
even greater dangers. It is the worker who
is hit on the head as he walks through un-
policed streets on his way to and from his
place of toil, and it is the workers—inoffen-
sive equally with riotous workers —who are
shot and batoned in crowds. The principle
big enough and sacred enough to justify
such wrongs is hardly imaginable. What
was the principle for which the Melbourne
police came out? They objected to the in-
spectorship system ! This System was cheer-
fully accepted by the Diggers, in and out
of the line, throughout the World War. It
exists, in one form or another, on every ship
and in every big business. No honest man
has anything to fear from it; in fact, the
honest welcome it as an insurance against
the competition of wasters. The public wel-
fare apart, it is as necessary in a police
force as in an army, unless the prestige ,of
the organisation is to be ruined by
from detection and punishment being con-
ferred on blackmailing, burgling and shirking
policemen. There has been an attempt by the
men’s sympathisers to justify their action by
making comparisons with the London police
strikes which followed the war. A material
difference, as the thousands of returned sol-
diers who were in London during these affairs
can testify, is that the London men, unjusti-
fiable as their oath-breaking conduct was in
principle, were careful to avoid fostering dis-
order. Their one aim was to draw public
attention to their considerable grievances,
and an outcome of this spirit was that less
crime occurred in the whole of London dur-
ing several policeless days and than
was committed in Melbourne on last Satur-
day evening alone. Th fact that mutinous
Victorian policemen, rr.. ,:y under the influ-
ence ,of liquor, joined n. the looting and en-
couraged the crowd to assault those who were
trying to keep order, suggests a much graver
trouble in the force than its long-recognised
inability to catch criminals. Clearly, if,
after such a lesson, the Government does not
see that the body is ruthlessly combed for
undesirables, Melbourne may shortly have an
upheaval which will produce repercussions all
over the Commonwealth.
Europe’s Smiling Bankrupt.
“France and Germany want wool, and despite the
weight ot her other obligations the latter is smilingly
buying it.” — Harry Austin, woolbuyer, in Sydney
Telegraph.
The old Franco-Prussian War was based on
force; the new and no less desperate one is
an affair of finesse and propaganda. The
other was a soldier’s, this is a financier s,
war. The prize of the first was relatively
paltry; the victor in the one which is now
raging will gain the mastery of Europe, and,
if it is Germany, maybe of the world. The
mercurial Lloyd George, who is now a Man-
chester Liberal again, put the position accu-
rately at the Supreme Council in 1921, when
he was still an Imperialist seeking the politi-
cal support of those who had fought beside
Frenchmen: “The Germans must be made to
pay. Otherwise it will mean that the victor
will pay the price of defeat, and the van-
quished will reap the fruits of victory.” He
is probably right in his latest charge that
the Rhenish republicans have received en-
couragement, if not inspiration, from Pans.
The headquarters of the conflicting forces are
respectively in Paris and Berlin. But there
is this difference: the French political and
diplomatic generals are working for France
alone, and are looking generations ahead,
while the only German leaders who count
are business men who, ever since the Armis-
tice, have considered the immediate in-
terests of themselves and their firms first.
If men of the B allin, Krupf and Stinnes
type had thought only of Germany’s national
life they would have fought to keep her sol-
vent, as the financiers of France fought to
keep their country solvent half a century
ago. The prompt, payment of a war debt
means more than freedom from the atten-
tions of a foreign invader: it usually has the
effect of giving an industrial lift to the
nation that pays, and of proportionately en-
feebling the one that receives. The great
financier-industrialists ivho have bossed every
German Government since the Revolution
are playing a game which, though it may
succeed, is essentially selfish. Under their
direction Germany has behaved, not at all
like ;the vastest debtor in history, but after
the manner of a spendthrift Power with too
mu fill gold. Millions have gone in roads,
bridges, canals, telephone lines and vast new
buildings—banks, opera-houses, theatres and
cinemas. Freights and fares on the State
transport systems have been kept ridiculously
low. A huge mercantile marine has been
built, the ships of which are beginning to
show in the principal world-ports. _ The
foreigner has been swindled out of incal-
culable sums by means of the depreciated-
mark trick, and other incalculable sums
have been invested abroad. When the French
went to the Ruhr for the money and material
which the organisers of these activities said
Germany lacked, Berlin ordered the Rhine-
landers to passively resist. It was Berlin
that debarred the French from using the
postal and telegraph services, ordered the
railwayman off the trains, and decreed severe
punishments for civilians who fraternised
with the alien debt-collectors. The Rhine-
landers wearied eventually of being martyr-
ised by Paris to gratify Potsdam, and they
have belatedly entered on the co-operative
policy which' the French suggested to them
in the first instance. But meantime the
struggle has taken a new shape. The Ger-
mans are as determined to repudiate as. ever,
and the French are undoubtedly turning a
friendly eye on the idea of disintegrating the
hereditary foe, who threatens to be even
more formidable in smiling, wool-buying,
shipbuilding and world-trading insolvency
than he would have been bad he got down to
honest debt-paying toil.

Britain and Protection.
When the victim of a bad habit decides on
reform it is often found that he has delayed
too long: if his trouble is gambling, the
bailiffs are already on the mat; if drink,
cirrhosis of the liver lias set in. This may
prove to be Britain’s plight with regard to
the Freetrade vice. After half a century
of effort to figlit unarmed against industrial
rivals whose armaments have constantly in-
creased, Big Business in the U.K. realises
that it can go on no longer. Prime Minis-
ter Baldwin announced last week that his.
Government was in favor of tackling
Britain’s trade rivals with their own
weapons:—
We must not be exposed to merciless foreign com-
petition while our competitors shield themselves be-
hind the walls of their own high tariffs. We mean
to fight the unhappy state of unemployment, which
is worse in Britain than anywhere in the world.
I am prepared to tame my political life in my hands,
and to stand or fall, by that cause.
He expects to have unionism behind him;
and, in addition to the “manufacturing in-
terest” (which is largely a duplication of
the unionist vote), there is-a big new Pro-
tectionist vote, created partly by the, food
scare during the war, and partly by the spec-
tacle of the industrial strides that are being-
made by the high-tariff countries. If the
plunge had been taken 20 years ago the
position would be favorable now. The awk-
ward period of transition would have been
entered upon with most of the Continental
exchanges normal—in other words, with
none of the Continental industries competing
at coolie-wage rates —and with a relatively
small army of unemployed. As it is, there
are going to be very . strenuous times,
assuming the Government carries its pro-
posals. Protection unquestionably sends up
prices, though not to the extent certain other
institutions do that flourish under Freetrade.
The annual profits of, the Cotton Combine
(which is virtually the Coats family) have
more than doubled since 1914, and the profit
per reel of cotton has almost quadrupled. A
country which is in good industrial health
can stand up to increases in its neces-
saries : one, like Britain, which is not, has
huge classes that are on the bread line, or
below it, and to these people the smallest
cost-of-living rise is a catastrophe. A
cable mentioned the other day that the
Northampton boot trade was being hard hit
by Continental competition in the home
market, and by the fact that the Protection-
ist Dominions are now manufacturing most
of their own boots. If articles like boots
are protected they will rise in price, and
immediately they do the nation’s rural
workers, whose pay is already inadequate,
will find it difficult, if not impossible, to
carry on. That must mean an exodus from
the country to the towns, and a decrease in
home-grown food. So the farming industry
will need protection in order that it may pay
higher wages. But there are myriads of
black-coated toilers in the cities —clerks, shop-
assistants, school-teachers, etc. —who earn
barely sufficient, week by week., to keep them
alive and decently clothed. The scheme of
Lord Linlithgow’s committee to re-establish
home baking and produce a 41b. loaf of all-
English bread at a saving of lid. is de-
signed for their salvation. A rise in the
price of food will mean starvation, or some-
thing like it, to them during the period
between the imposition of a and the
jump in wages which follow’s upon a
tariff becoming economically operative. It is a
black lookout all round, and an era of misery
threatens for all but the aristocracy of capi-
talism and labor. The silver lining to the cloud
is the knowledge that, when the too-protracted
Freetrade debauch has been expiated in suf-
fering and disorder, vast national economies
will begin to arrive simultaneously with in-
creased national earnings. A sum of 50
millions sterling was allocated this year tor
unemployed relief alone; and it has just
been announced that, “if necessary, another
50 millions will be provided” !
Side-tracking the Obvious.
The report of Gregory, chairman of the
Federal Public Works Committee, on the
Northern Territory, rather unhopefully sug-
gests certain projects or shuffles which he
thinks might induce that ill-used elephant to
burst into fragrant bloom of wine and roses,
so to speak. Among these are :
(1) The Administrator to have full powers, be-
cause rule from Melbourne by officials who know
nothing about the Territory is absurd.
(2) New ports, cheaper freights.
(3) Darwin to be a free port for 10 years
(4) Resumption in whole or part of the pastoial
areas now not legitimately occupied.
(5) An end made of the reigin of terror of
Labor organisations.
161 Construction of a railway from Broome to
Camooweal to tap the “millions of areas of one-sheep-
to-the-acre country south of Derby and continuing
into the Territory.”
“When all these things have been done,
says Gregory, “it may be found that we
can with confidence recommend the comple-
tion of the railway from Darwin to Port
Augusta.” In other words, Gregory is
willing that the Commonwealth should re-
jiudiate its contract with South Aus. until
nothing will matter to any living Australian.
Though a railway from Broome to Camooo-
weal would probably cost more than the
direct North-South line from Oodnadatta to
Darwin (the distance being about the same,
it would cost no less), and though it might
promote settlement at both the Queensland
and the Westralian ends, it is difficult to
see liow it would help to increase the popula-
tion of either the top or the bottom end of
the Territory proper: and it is the Territory
that is Commonwealth property, f urther,
for defence purposes such a line, uniting a
small discolored port on the Timor Sea with
an eastern port of similar tonnage at Towns-
ville, would be about as useful as a line from
Muswellbrook to the moon. On the other
hand, both Townsville and Broome could be
swiftly linked together, and to Darwin, and to
every Australian capital (bar Hobart) it the
North-South line was first pushed through.
Gregory’s scheme is, in brief, merely another
example of taking the long way round, _ in
order to avoid obstacles which don t exist.
Settlement of the Territory by white folks
in the interests of White Australia is merely
a matter of making it worth the settlers
while. Australian and American experience
is that individuals of the breed will go any-
where and face anything to secure for them-
selves a bit of the earth to have and to hold
under reasonable conditions. If, as Gregory
admits, there are millions of acres of good
grazing and agricultural areas in the Terri-
tory and parts adjacent, what prevents us
making conditions reasonable for settlers by
giving them as many acres as they can use
for any good purpose, and taking them there
by rail? There are sufficient bits of the earth
available in that region to satisfy the land-
hunger of at least 100.000 good W hite Aus-
tralians, and from what we have seen ot
their doings in the past, as pioneers and
we should have no hesitation m
handing them all the land they want, plus
the railway. If we can’t socialise the show,
on Moscow, or any other lines (and we
assuredly can’t), we can at least give Cos-
sack methods a trial.
——
Licensed Banditry.
The N. S. Wales Parliamentary Committee
appointed to inquire into the pony-racing
business began its investigations the other
day. One of the first witnesses was 1. D.
Kingsley, secretary of the Pony Owners
and Trainers’ Association, who said :
His association had 238 members. There were 209
licensed trainers, and 204 of them were members ot
his association. He thought 95 per cent, of them
were “broke.” They were depending on one another.
Mr. Mutcii: If they are all “broke,” how can
they depend on one another?-—lf a man wins a race
he will always help his brother trainers. Book-
makers will help one another Sometimes trainee
go to bookmakers and borrow £2O or £3O until thev
win a race.
In answer to Mr. Jaqtjes the witness pro-
vided a possible explanation of the_x ea dmess
of bookmakers to lend trainers £2O or ±oO
until they win a race” :—-
There may be times when a bookmaker gets the
“tip” that a horse has no chance, and he can get
money out of it. Also, he may get the tip that
the horse could win, and lie could then back it.
A Sydney Sun interview with “some promi-
nent pony trainers” was quoted by I iie
Bulletin a month or so back, in which one
of these gentry observed: —
The present system encourages us to keep fourth-
rate horses in work.. I have, two myself. When
they win they certainly advance a division but all
I have to do is run them half a dozen byes and
they are again among- the “goats. lhe A.K.u.
encourages us to pull them up.
Taking the two sets of disclosures in con-
junction, it appears that the workers who
patronise the ponies risk their hard-earned
or hard-embezzled cash, as the case may be,
under the following handicaps: —
(1) The animals they back are poor in quality,
and therefore unreliable. “We are frightened to
buy good horses,” the trainer already quoted told the
Sun, “as the ‘goats’ would interfere with them.
(2) The trainers have at least two reasons for
running their charges “byes,” or in other 'voids
stiffening them: (a) to get the useless brutes into
a class sufficiently low for them to be sure of winning
when backed by the stable; (b) to Pjacate the
stable’s bookmaker-creditors who have laid the odds
against them to the public.
Suppose this state of affairs was disclosed in
any other money-earning concern save racing
—the tramway service, for example, sup-
pose that, while the profits from the trams
were enormous (one pony magnate draws
£IO,OOO a year from a single course, and
others, according to Mr. Kingsley, have
made fortunes and sold out ), the drivers,
conductors and inspectors were in VJo per
cent, of cases broke,” and lienee tempted to
earn a livelihood by swindling the passen-
gers If such a situation were sworn to
bv reputable witnesses in a tramway service,
the roar of public reprobation would be aud-
ible from South Cape to Darwin. But be-
cause the daylight robbery is bound up with
ponv-racing there is a pretty general ten-
dency to take it for granted, and agree that
here licensed banditry is both reputable and
in the best interests of the public. It is a
point on which The Bulletin is at issue
with the majority of N. S:. Wales s legisla-
tors. In this paper’s opinion enough evi-
dence has already been made public to call
for the immediate abolition of a huge and
ruinous ramp which is evidently incorrigible
and irreclaimable.
The Little Industries.
Years ago, in a decaying Victorian town,
from which there was a persistent exodus
of young women to the capital and of young-
men to distant goldfields, a woman, poor and
not young, set up in business as a manu-
facturer of feminine underwear. Her plant
consisted of two sewing-machines, her staff
of herself and an assistant, her factory of a
room in her small dwelling. But she had a
,r 0 o(l business head, and was clever at her
craft. As her local market expanded she
hired four more machines and hands. Orders
came from Geelong, from Melbourne, from
Sydney; in time a considerable part of her
output was going to N. S. Wales. At 70
she was pointed out to visitors as the founder
of a whitework factory employing 700 girls
girls so well paid that out of their wages
they defrayed the cost of dedicating an
avenue of honor to the A.I.F. and of plant-
ing a tree in memory of every district volun-
teer. The woman was Bleanor Lucas, who
died on October 27: the town is Ballarat.
Thanks, in a measure, to her enterprise, and
still more to her example, it is no longer
a place of decay, but one which has had
an industrial rebirth, and regards the future
without the fears that depressed it in the
past. The melancholy drift of population
from Ballarat has been arrested ; such move-
ment as occurs nowadays is, generally speak-
ing, <x mutter of choice, not., as used to bo
the case, of necessity. One sign of the new
prosperity is a substantial increase in land
values, which were stationary for a quarter
of a century. There are valuable lessons to
be learned from the achievement of this Bal-
larat sewing-woman. One is that, given
adequate Protection and reasonable railway
rates (both which the Lucas enterprise en-
joys), a country town, where land is cheap,
is* a better place for a factory than any
swollen capital. Another is that, in a Com-
monwealth which imports £181.000,000 worth
of goods per annum, a business with the hum-
blest beginnings may grow into a pretty big
thing. Clones (Vic.), which was in danger
of fading from the economic map, has been
revived by knitting-mills. Narrogin (W.A.)
has a doli-factory, the products of which are
sold in Melbourne and Sydney. Australia
would be all the better for a multitude of
such undertakings. Even as things are, with
railway rates working against the country
town, many useful little workroom and back-
yard industries, some with possibilities of
greatness, might be started outside the capi-
tals. For one thing, the dependableness of
the labor is a valuable set-off against the dis-
abilities which the politicians have imposed.
♦
The N.S.W. Railway Policy.
The N.S.W. Public Works Committee re-
cently considered four proposals for railways
to connect, or help connect, the northern
tableland with the coast and with any
northern ports which might be handy. It
turned them all down without hesitation. A
fifth one wasn’t even considered, but just
dropped. The reason assigned was that
there was a doubt whether the lines would
pay. In the paper which reported these
doings appeared two other reports. One
was to the effect that the Regent’s Park-
Cabramatta line is nearly ready for traffic.
This is an extension of an enterprise which,
at latest advices, was losing money at the
rate of £3300 per mile per annum; but as
it is a Sydney suburban concern its unpay-
ableness doesn't matter. The next, item
concerned the Blacktown-Richmond railway
(Blacktown is 21 miles from Sydney). This
loses £2OO per mile per annum, and has
been doing it or something like it for 59
years. It is now to be extended to a dead-
end among the Kurrajong hills. Every
few months some plausible old gentleman
like Joseph Carbuthers, who doesn’t hold
the Railways portfolio, is sent to pervade
the Northern Tableland with an assurance
that the line to the coast, or several of them,
will come out of the very next loan. Not
being the responsible party the plausible old
gentleman can be officially disavowed, or
ignored, or dropped; and he always is. Vet
his expression of damaged innocence if his
assurances are not accepted at face value
is wonderful to see. The policy of massing
public works in the district which belongs
geographically to the capital helps to
keep the North and South without the
population, and consequently the voting
power, which would enable them to secede,
and that is no doubt what the policy is in-
tended for. But it is possible to be too
clever. If Separation does come through
something going wrong with the constitu-
tional “scrap of paper,” or if a chance jolt
capsizes the constitutional apple-cart, the
natural thing will be to divide the fixed
assets and the attached liabilities. Then the
Centre will have an amazing collection of
railways and debts and deficits, while the
separated provinces will have most of the
land revenues which used to help pay for
these deficits. Vienna is the most pathetic
city in Europe to-day. It was built as the
congested and centralised capital of an em-
pire—built to scale, so to speak. Most of
the attached territory wanted to secede, but
the gay city was built on the assumption that
secession would never come off. Secessioii
did, however, come, and Vienna, instead of
having a Dual Empire of 261.000 square
miles to feed upon, is the capital of an area
of about 33,000 square miles, which isn’t
very much more than Tasmania. So it has
become something akin to a large and very
celebrated camel reduced to graze on a flower-
pot. Sydney has advantages which would
prevent it having quite such a downfall, but
if it reaches the 2,000,000 population mark
and secession then happens, it may have
trouble enough and depression to give away.
The New Meat Era.
“El Verdtjgo” re-appears:—
Eighteen months ago, assisted and exhilarated by
the angry opposition of one “Jimmy Trousers” and
other crusted ancients, I dreamed in The Bulletin
of the day when the meat producers in Australia would
realise that they had a common interest and begin to
organise for the capture of the world’s markets.
Scarcely had the quivering of my friend’s indignant
whiskers stilled itself than the dream began to come
true. In 12 months, thanks to assiduous investigation,
the Australian Meat Council has brought the industry
nearer to unity than even the butter and cheese
people, and, while they have not disregarded the les-
sons learnt from the experiences qf the butter people,
they have not made the old mistake (inevitable under
the conditions in which the butter people started) of
sectionalising the industry and trying to wipe out the
private meat-killing companies in one act. The model
adopted for the meat organisation approaches more
nearly to that of the Ceylon tea-planters, who, finding
some years ago that their name was mud and their
product unwanted, agreed to a compulsory poundage
levy on all exports, the money being used for the im-
provement of their product and the organisation of
selling methods; which meant that, where hitherto
the planters had worked individually, they now oper-
ated with a united front. No longer were a hundred
individual teas of Ceylon offered in the market.
Organised selection of plants, careful grading and
packing and standardisation gave the whole product
of the island a character of its own. Ceylon tea
became a generic term, to be spoken proudly in the
trade.
The Australian Meat Council is working towards
the same end and in the same way, and the Goddess
of Good Fortune seems to have been watching over if
from the beginning. It secured a promise of statu-
tory and preliminary financial support from the Com-
monwealth (on satisfactory guarantees, of course) ;
it had the good sense to realise that it would be a

mistake to make war on the meatworks, and it has
shown a friendly concern for the interests of labor,
which has so far earned the endorsement of the diffi-
cult Queensland Labor crowd that Theodore and Co.
have been the first people to put an enabling and
authorising bill through giving power to the Meat
Industry Board (of which the industry itself has com-
plete control) to make a small levy and devote the
proceeds to the purposes of Australian national meat
organisation. The Meat Council, which will co-
ordinate the work of the State Boards, is already
actively preaching better stock-raising methods,
drought insurance, reasonable freights, scientific
handling and improved oversea selling. All its
operations are based on an honest recognition of the
fact that we have had difficulties with our meat
sales because (1) we have not always
produced what the world wants and
(2) other countries are better sales-
people.
“The best kind of preference,’’ says
•T. B. Cbamsib, who is the god in the
meat-machine, “is the kind you earn
by producing- the best.” When we
can grade up our meat to measure
above the standard of the rest of
the world, we won’t need to bother
about artificial policies of support. The
iact that N. S. Wales butter usually
sweeps the board of prizes at the
annual Islington Dairy Show has
greater weight in its sale than a riy
favor which the British Government
could extent to it. Australia is quite
capable of being- the source of the
world’s primest meat within ten years
if we put our weight to the wheel.
We are going to see that it is put.

Ma and Her Troubles.
Murray, one of the Labor mem-
bers for Newcastle, declared in
the Assembly the other day that
"wages are lower in N. S.
Wales than in Victoria,” and
offered to prove it “in black
and white.” Nobody disputed
the assertion or reminded the
orator that Victoria is the one
State that has never been gov-
erned on Labor-socialist prin-
ciples. Neither did anyone re-
mark that N. S. Wales has en-
joyed a succession of Labor
Governments (thinly disguised
as “Nationalist” now and then)
and an extensive variety of
Labor devices, such as the
basic-wage-fixing Board of
Trade, for raising pay and re-
ducing hours of work. A day
or two before Murray made his
moan Cocks, the Nationalist
Treasurer, announced that the
N.S.W. public debt had soared
to £183,571,000 (exclusive of
£9,826,000 advanced by the
Commonwealth for soldier-
settlement) and the annual in-
terest bill to £8,384,000, where-
as the amounts in the last
pre-war financial year were
£116,695,000 and £3,881,000 re-
spectively. The 67 borrowed
millions have, it seems, been
devoted to building railways,
“from which it is impossible to
expect a reasonable return on
capital invested,” in starting
other lines “which will inevit-
ably add to the burden of the
100,000 income-taxpayers,” in
extending irrigation works, “re-
conditioning” roads, acquiring
trawlers, fish-shops and other
State enterprises, and, in these
undertakings and others, “pro-
viding work for the unem-
ployed”—the right to. work
(especially at election-time, and
on such jobs as shifting sand
from one part of a doubtful
constituency to another) being
part of the Labor creed. And
the results, in addition to the
railways that will never pay,
are that the irrigation business
has been run at a huge loss, the
trawlers, after contributing
lavishly to the accumulated
deficit of £2,774,000, have been
sold for a song, the N.S.W.
roads and footpaths retain their
ancient imputation of being
oasily the worst in Australia (this was said
at a recent Good Roads Conference), and
the unemployed are as plentiful and impor-
tunate as ever. When counted last month
by the officers who attend to this branch of
statistics they totalled 9000. The income-tax,
being the main impost levied by the State
Governments, is a good test of their adminis-
tration of public affairs. In Victoria it
starts at 4d. in the £ of taxable income and
works up to 7d. on individual taxpayers, Is.
on company profits, and Is. 2d. on income de-
rived from property. In N. S. Wales the
rates are from Is. to 2s. 3d. in the £ on
personally-earned incomes, 2s. 6d. on com-
pany profits and up to 3s. on net receipts
from property. And further delights are in
store for the 100,000 taxpayers if, as the
Treasurer suggested in his Budget speech,
the cost of the several State superannuation
schemes has been so grossly underestimated
that at least £2,000,000 will have to be paid
in to make them solvent—an “annual con-
tribution” of £2,000,000, Cocks said,
although Attorney-General Bavin’s version
is that one payment of £2,000,000 addi-
tional to the usual annual contribution (it
was £703,000 in 1921 and £722,000 in 1922)
rnay be sufficient. Another official statement
of interest to the taxpayers is that passen-
ger fares for single and return journeys and
mileage rates on fruit, wheat, coal, agricul-
tural machinery and so forth are liigher in

N. S. Wales than in Victoria. This is one of
several reasons why the Sydney householder
has to pay 2s. 6d. a cwt. for coal, 4d. a pound
for potatoes (they were that recently), from
Id. to 4d. a pound more than the Melbourne
price for butter, and from Id. to 3d. a dozen
more for eggs, and why fruit and vegetables
are generally at famine rates.

“Lex” theorises:—
The Melbourne police strike, and the fact that,
despite the object-lesson it afforded, a sympathy
strike was actually discussed elsewhere over the
week-end, imply that the morale of the forces in
some parts of Australia is poor. A policeman -s
a soldier on permanent active-service, with the difier-
ence that when he downs arms in face 0 f the
enemy he endangers the lives of classes which in
war-time are miles behind the line. A battalion
which struck fighting and went over to a ravening
enemy when a village crowded with women and
children was being attacked would be held up to
scorn for all time. That, in effect, is what the
Melbourne police have done, and up to the time of
writing most of them appear to be proud of it
My explanation of the discreditable phenomenon
is that tlie self-respect of our soldiers of order has
been sapped by unsoldierly work. In any police
headquarters, meaty men in uniform may be
seen tapping typewriters, filling in forms and per-
forming other duties which the flapper could do as
well, or better. Early closing and the tightening
up of the liquor laws have led to the employment of
innumerable policemen as provocative agents. Take
the type of John Hop who is chosen for the Job
of visiting a restaurant and representing himself as
a man-about-town anxious for an illegal beer with
his dinner. This specialist has to be a hypocrite,
a liar and a poor character in many other respects
if Le is to bring to his shabby work the enthusiasm
requisite for success. It is extremely easy to prove
a sale of liquor after hours, and any unemployed
pimp or fizz-gig could do it as effectively as a
policeman. The exploitation of unashamed undesir-
ables in such unsavory duties would save the force
from much of the public odium which now attaches
to it, and which is going to increase with the
growth of the anti-liquor movement, and it would
free able-bodied young constables for what shoulu
be their real, life’s work —the apprehension of crimi-
nals and the prevention of crime.
«
According to the Speck’s Agent-General.
« B. Ashbolt, the only hope for shippers
of fruit, meat and dairy produce from Aus-
tralian and other Dominions to the Cold
Country is to set up a central organisation
m Britain to haudle and distribute the car-
goes, preferably through shops owned and
controlled by the organisation, which would
be financed or guaranteed up to 33 per cent,
by Dominion Governments. Ashbolt de-
clares that the present methods of dealing
with overseas cargoes leaves the producer
and consumer practically at the mercy of
the organised brokers and other
middlemen of Britain. Tin-
latter, acting through Austra-
lian representatives, make ad-
vances through the shippers to
the producers, and naturally
their first care when the stuff
gets to London is to recover
their advances and out-of-pocket
expenses. This often means
that the produce is rushed on
to the market directly the ships
arrive and sold for whatever it
will fetch in excess of the actual
cash advanced to the grower.
Ashbolt’s idea is that a power-
ful central organisation of pro-
perly-paid and Government-
financed distributors, compris-
ing representatives of Australia.
Canada, India and South Africa,
could regulate the arrival of
cargoes so as to prevent gluts,
and so market the goods that
the actual producer would get
a much better cut and the con-
sumer a fairer deal. The
scheme means the practical an-
nihilation of the Private Enter-
prise middleman in Britain, and.
of course, as Ashbolt admits,
this would mean an all-in fight
between the Dominions’ Market-
ing Union and vested interests.
But Ashbolt pledges his not
inconsiderable business reputa-
tion that such a combination of
the overseas Dominions would
win if up-to-date advertising
propaganda were adopted and
the organisation placed in the
hands of “the best business
manager money could buy."
Strict standardisation of pro-
ducts before shipment, under
Government control, with Gov-
ernment cash advances to grow-
ers unable to wait for account
sales from Britain, would have
to be undertaken. The scheme
is ambitious ; but if a keen busi-
ness-man like the Speck’s Agent-
General is willing to take on
the task of organising the pro-
ject, the last thing that should
be put in his way is discourage-
ment.
“Homfrey Beale” : There is
no doubt whatever that many
country justices approach a case
with bias when an alias appears
after an accused’s name on the
charge-sheet (B. 18/10/’23).
In a case I reported about 12
months ago the presiding J.P.
looked up as soon as the charge
was read and ejaculated with an
air of ultra-righteous condem-
nation, “H’m! I see you have
two. ale-esses.” The accused
having no counsel, and being
slow-witted, it went at that:
had the evidence been weaker
than it was, I am convinced the
alternative names would have
tipped the balance against the
prisoner. Even city magis-
trates, it has been impressed on
me by several years of police-
court reporting, are not invari-
ably free from the habit of re-
garding aliases as evidence,
especially when the flies are
bad and the chap in the dock
appears to have broken off
friendly relations with the bath.
Yet even an unwashed pri-
soner should get a fair spin.
The Christmas Bulletin is due on De-
cember 8. It is a good number, in which 49
writers and 42 black-and-white artists are
represented. The verse includes the last long
piece of Henry Lawson’s —it was written in
hospital. There is a prose sketch of his, too.
Other verse writers are E. J. Brady, “John
O’Brien” (who wrote “The Boree Log”),
Mary Gilmore, D. M. Wright, M. Forrest.
Peter Airey, “Nil” (Dr. Souter), and the
veteran G. G. McCrae; there is one of Nor-
man Lindsay’s pages of bears: “The Old Buf-
fers’ Race” is a delightful country page by
Leason; and there are 30 short stories by
Australia’s front-rank writers.

the remote Federal capital. The biggest
State (Westralia) spent £22 15s. lOd. per
head, and the next biggest (Queensland)
£l6 4s. Bd. On the other hand the smallest
State (Tasmania) cost £lO 10s. 10d., and
the next smallest (Victoria) £l3 Is. 9d.
These figures look as if they meant some-
thing.
A condensed lesson of the Melbourne riots
is that, even when a city is the capital (or
acting capital), and has military, naval and
air forces concentrated in its vicinity, and
there are two full-blown Governments in it
to provide for defence, and these two Govern-
ments have received fairly long notice that
trouble is possible, a very ugly and expen-
sive smash may happen. A great deal de-
pends on the pair of full-blown and copious
Administrations getting off the mark in
time.
The last Federal “Quarterly Summary"
showed that at June 30 Australia owed money
at 24 different rates of interest, which re-
vealed a versatile spirit, anyhow. In 1919
the top rate was 5§ per cent., but since then
the country has gone into debt at 6 per cent,
(over £30,000,000), also at 64, £6 6s. 4d.,
£6 7s. 6Jd., £6 15s. 2d., 7,7 i and 71. South
Australia is now raising another £2,000,000
for “the settlement of discharged soldiers,
railway improvements and other services.”
The fact that the interest is more than the
nominal 5J per cent, is disguised by putting
the balance in the shape of exemption from
State and Federal income-tax. There are
now four States out of six with peace debts
of over £lOO per head, and a fifth lives in
hope.
After the fashion of cable-tram men and
other industrialists who don’t know exactly
what they want, Vic. Assemblymen are pur-
suing go-slow tactics. When the Cup ex-
citement has simmered down, Lawson and
Allan will try to speed up. The Premier
told the Chamber of Commerce the other day
A political view of it: —
The police strike in Melbourne, and the control
of that city by the criminal classes, are part of the
price Australia is paying for the crazy socialism of
the last few years. Every extension of Government
employment has been followed by a lessening of
respect for. executive authority. In theory, the oppo-
site was to have occurred; the Government was to
grow stronger as it added to the names on its pay-
sheets, until it attained the maximum of power and
beneficence as the universal employer. In practice,
government has become associated in many minds
with unpopular foremen and jacks-in-office; with
corrupt and white-livered politicians; with the
exasperatingly stupid ways of bureaucracy and the
demoralising traffic in votes. Familiarity with the
Government as a boss has bred contempt for it as
an institution.
Tile Plymouth speech of Baldwin, the
British Prime Minister, conveyed the im-
pression that, although willing to wound the
Freetrade superstition, he shrank from strik-
ing. But at Swansea last week, perhaps
fortified by the advice of the dying Bonar
Law, he definitely broke with Cobdenism
(“an ideal which may be good but is not
within the region of practical politics”), an-
nounced that the British fiscal system would
have to be approximated to “that of every
other country,” and, arguing that the British
trade unionist is a natural Protectionist,
although his leaders still mumble the sophis-
tries of the Manchester school, appealed for
working-class support. This is taken to
mean that the Government intends going to
the country on the fiscal issue some time
next year. Meanwhile, the Conservative
party, now as Protectionist as it was before
Peel and Cobden ruined British agriculture,
is winning by-elections.
Roused perhaps by the action of the
N.S.W. Public Works Committee in rejecting
all northern railway proposals holus bolus,
Treasurer Earle Page shed some of his affa-
bility at Murwillumbah, and said that if his
New State wasn’t granted separation it
would just take the article. The theory is
that if there is no remedy by law then it is
legitimate to make one. The only way to
bring down the cost of government, he said,
is to have more and smaller States. And on
gross outgoings, though that may be a rough
and ready test, the attempt to govern huge
areas from one centre does seem costly. The
spendings in the Northern Territory (1921)
were at the rate of £94 13s. Bd. per inhabi-
tant, the N.T. being governed direct from

to Rules and Regulations requiring them to be polite to passengers, they are disorganising the service."
that it was a risky thing to reshuffle a Minis-
try during a session. He didn’t know what
would happen next, he said, and the impres-
si on conveyed by his manner was that he
didn’t greatly care.
Among Tasmanian Laborites it is reckoned
that the non-inclusion in the new Cabinet
of ex-storekeeper Sheridan, dairyman Becker
or farmer and ex-soldier Hurst is a mistake
or a misfortune or something. But as Hurst
becomes Whip and party secretary, and
Becker takes Belton’s old seat on the F'ublic
Works Committee, and Sheridan takes mat-
ters philosophically, disruption of Labor’s
side from jealousy is not a strong hope of
the opposite party.
Dreary are the proceedings of the Vic.
Select Committee which is inquiring into the
two gas bills. The three wrecks allowed for
the investigation expired long ago, and the
report may not be ready till the middle of the
month. Meanwhile the big Metropolitan Co.
professes to be ready to sell out, but
there is no municipal purchaser in sight.
Though the City Council runs an electric-
supply business successfully, it is not keen
on taking over a gas plant at the price the
co. asks, so the co. is quietly looking tor
a new works site. On present appearances
there will be no legislation this session.
Queensland Parliament, which in its
ardor for work has been known to sit four
times a week, has closed another exhausting
year. Proceedings began on July 11 and
finished on November 2, whereas the 1921
session lasted three months, and the 1922
programme was put through in 184 hours.
The Commonwealth Parliament has acquired
the same bad habit; it took less than four
months to do its job in 1922 and less than
three months this year. Yet there lias not
been any reduction in the quantity of legisla-
tion dumped on the Statute Book; on the
contrary, it seems to be the aim of these
slovenly Parliaments to pass the maximum
of bills in the minimum of time. The reduc-
tion has been in quality; the shorter the
session, as a rule, the worse the work. Aus-
tralia would be better served were members
paid by the sitting (six full hours to con-
stitute* a sitting) instead of by the year.
The A.L.P. in Sydney has begun to purify
the movement of Communists, so Garden and
Howie have been shot out. But the move-
ment only applies to people who are so foolish
as to advertise themselves by belonging openly
to a Communist organisation. And those
who are most successful in doing the “white-
ant” business in the trades-union ranks don’t
advertise themselves, just as the most suc-
cessful spy doesn’t wear the spy’s uniform
(green, with blue pants and a vermilion
cocked hat topped off with three feathers)
to show that he is spying. So the Red Ob-
jective will probably go marching on.
The official Labor party in Britain is, accord-
ing to its leaders, going to fight for Freetrade
to the last ditch. Freetrade and international-
ism are quite all right —provided you are
satisfied with your poorest competitor s
standard of living. So if the British Labor
party is prepared to be the Coolie party, its
leaders are doing just the right thing.
From the Deputy Director: —
Migration is a big human business, and it would be
foolish to imagine that in bringing thousands of new
settlers to Australia 100 per cent, success could be
attained. There will inevitably be misfits and break-
downs ; but it may be of interest to Bulletin readers
that only .1 per cent, of the assisted migrants brought
to Australia since the Commonwealth Government
took over the recruiting of new settlers in Great Bri-
tain have been returned to that country owing fo
medical unfitness.
The Speck's Lee Government having
sacked Railway Commissioner Smith a lew
days before it was sacked itself. 1 remier
Lyons’s first job was the filling o |t‘;
vacancy. The hurried choice fell upon LLemj
Bye, a plain stationmaster. Bye has been
32 years in the Tas. railways, has some repu-
tation as an organiser, and is regarded by tnc
employees in every grade of the service as
a “dinkum bloke.” He is mostly addressed
as Harry. His appointment as Commis-
sioner is, however, only till the end of tin
present year. The Government couldn tin
decency make the term longer, being a tem-
porary affair itself.
Uncle Sam’s “Quota” law governing immi-
gration will run out at the middle ot next
year; and some mixed forces are wor King
against its renewal. As usual the colored-
labor problem comes in; it has a habit ot
coming in—no country that takes on a
colored-labor problem can keep it out ot any-
thing. In this case, the Quota law having
been chiefly instrumental in excluding the
lowest grade of labor, the Northern States
which had got used to a steady flow ot that
sort turned south for supplies, with the re-
sult that there has been a remarkable migra-
tion of nigger from the South —even to States
which hardly knew there was n ce> 1 oi'c* d-1 ut ’oi•
problem. During last year 324,000 negro
farm-laborers alone left the South tor the
North, many of them for States which are
pretty evenly divided on the old party lines:
which means that their votes are going to
fetch a big price presently. Back home m
the South Rastus had a vote, ot course:
but the South took good care that it didn t
count for much.
S.A. Assembly broke out of its accus-
tomed calm when Robinson, of the Minis-
terial party, being much worried by inter-
jections from the Labor side, told his oppo-
nents that they were “like a pack of vvild
dogs.” Naturally they asked the Speaker
to call him to order, and more than hinted
that it should have been done without their
asking. Richard Butler, who. is too much
of an old warrior to be the ideal Speaker,
said that “if honorable members do not wish
to be associated with wild dogs, they should
draw my attention to the statement, and I
will order its withdrawal.” Then Denny
told him not to be facetious, and the House
fell into what the papers call “Disorder.
Finally, Robinson withdrew the wild-dog
simile, and substituted a statement that
members were like babies cutting their
first teeth, and in need of soothing-syrup.
This remark went unchallenged, being found
consistent with that tremendous thing the
Dignity of Parliament.
The theory is that all “comrades” are
equal, but its hollowness is demonstrated
when an obscure official gets between the
wind and the nobility of some magnifico ot
“the movement.” Labor boss Bailey, criti-
cised by one Swiney, replied with towering
scorn that Swiney was “only a clerk m the
A.W.U. office.” Carbines, another caviller,
was dismissed with the withering statement
that he was “only an organiser of the rail-
way-workers’ branch.” Louis XIV reprov-
ing the flunkey wffio brought in his foot-bath
could hardly have been more royally insolent.
A complaint by the Westraliau Taxation
Commissioner that employees of the Wynd-
ham meatworks, a Government concern, had
defaulted to the extent of £lOOO, has been
mentioned in the Perth Parliament. \\ hen
the debt was contracted there w T ere no higher
paid wage-slaves in the Commonwealth than
those meatworkers, £lO and £l2 a week be-
ing common. Moreover, board and lodging
were provided by the benevolent Govern-
ment at about half cost. Partly for these
reasons the works were run at a frightful
loss, and this, of course, came out of the
taxes; indeed, with the taxpayers to fall
back on, the meatworkers got “the full re-
sult of their labor” and a lot more. Then-
way of showing gratitude—the way of the
majority, anyhow—was to sneak off with-
out weighing in with their income-tax. A
noble example of the elevating influence of
State socialism.
Nothing bad or violent which happens in
Melbourne seems quite complete unless there
appears in connection with it the name of
Tom Walsh. He made his usual appearance
in connection with the Melbourne police
strike, urging, as usual, an appeal to “force,”
and the force eventuated to the extent of
some few killed, hundreds injured, and
damage and robbery assessed rather casually
at a million. Thomas Walsh, running a
seamen’s strike in the capacity of seamen’s
secretary, and threatening with the aid of
admiring friends of the criminal classes to
make Melbourne unsafe after dark, might
have some sort of official standing. The
same person, butting into a police strike, has
none, and looks like a mere professional de-
structionist, enemy of civilisation, and in-
citer to crime. Thomas being useless,
monotonous, not ornamental, and a perennial
cause of annoyance, his deportation is long-
overdue ; but since w r e have allowed him to
stay nearly 30 years, we shall probably have
to put up with him altogether. But we
might at least do him the honor of housing
him where he couldn’t play so often with
fire.
ROADS OF FRANCK.
(Armistice Day, November 11, 1923.)
[FOR THE BULLETIN. ]
You have your moods, oh Roads of France,
As we who loved you know,
Since he of giant bt&in and hand
With vision saw and genius planned
The ways that you should go ;
It could not be that grim despair
And love and hate passed o’er you there
And left no trace below.
What glorious tales could you not tell
Who watched our troops advance:
Of vows fulfilled, with death the price,
Of love and splendid sacrifice
Surpassing old romance,
And gallant deeds earth never knew —
If speech were only given you,
Oh silent Roads of France!
You bore their feet, dear Roads of France,
■ For whom we prayed in vain;
You heard the voices strong and clear
That we in dreams might only hear,
And shall not know' again;
Whom we remember all our years
With deathless pride and blinding tears
And memory’s ceaseless pain.
Some by you laid their burden down,
So long and bravely borne;
And at thj last great sacrifice
They turned to you, with shining eyes,
When mists had been withdrawn —
When din, and strife, and turmoil ceased
And saw you stretch out to the east,
Long Avenues ofDDarn.w r n.
And others, when the great eall came,
Who freely gave their best
Looked out to you, so often trod,
And saw you stretch, transformed by God,
All gold from east to west —
A bridge to His divinest things,
A pathway meet for sceptred kings,
A royal road to rest.

Early in the financial year the South Brit-
ish purchased a controlling interest in the
Eastern United Assurance Corp. of the
Straits Settlements. The price has not been
disclosed; but it was paid partly in cash and
the balance by the issue of 31,640 South
British shares paid to 15s. at a premium of
31s. 6d. Paid capital has, therefore, in-
creased from £750,000 to £773.730, and re-
serves have benefited by £34,013 of share
premiums. The acquisition of this business
did not save a further fall in premium in-
come ; owing to restricted trading at lower
values, net premiums were £57,772 less than
the phenomenal figures for 1921. Mean-
while costs have continued to climb; they
were higher in only one other year. But
losses were a little easier, and the under-
writing surplus for the year was £79,844,
against £75,412 for 1922. £141,246 for 1921
and £166.927 for 1920. The following table
takes underwriting comparisons back almost

The problem immediately ahead of insur-
ance managements is to reduce costs. The
difference between the 1915 and 1923 South
British cost-rates means no less than £45,052
more of income flowing out on its present
insurance turnover, and is equal to one-half
of the amount required for divs. On, the other
hand, the abnormally large surpluses accu-
mulated during the war have helped invest-
ment earnings, and interest rates are also
higher; the South British’s average funds
last year amounted to £1,828,174. compared
with £843,180 in 1915, and the interest rate
had increased from 5 p.c. to 5.2 p.c. No
cash-paid capital had meantime been called
in.
Investment earnings are such important
contributors to South British profits nowa-
days that they alone provide every penny
of shareholders’ divs. The profits shown in
the introductory table are made up in this
way: Underwriting surplus, £79,844; inter-
est and rents. £95,311; and additions to in-
vestment fluctuation reserves, £1533. The
co.’s position is so strong that after paying
Ilf p.c. on £773,730 of paid capital, which
includes no less than £650,000 of bonus scrip
issued since 1912. the whole of the under-
writing surplus and £6576 besides was avail-
able to strengthen reserves. The reserve
accumulations are very substantial. The
£462.000 set aside as unearned premiums was
53 p.c. of last year’s net premium income,
whereas 40 p.c. is regarded as a fair pro-
vision for unexpired risks. All funds
(capital and reserves) were equal to 219
p.c. of not premium income: 150 p.c. is gen-
erally regarded as a safe proportion. At
August 31 the South British had in first-
class investments almost enough to pay four
times last year’s losses without requisition-
ing any of the quarter-million of •uncalled
capital. At the balancing date the co.
showed £1,691,055 in gilt-edged securities and
cash, debtor and branch balances totted up
£168.177. £52,947 was out in mortgages, and
premises had a, book value of £341,798.
The Colonial Sugar Refining Cos., Ltd.
—Shareholders were called together in Syd-
ney on October 31, but no accounts were sub-
mitted to show financial results for the half-
year. The directors explained, with their
customary air of mystery, that (1) difficul-
ties had been experienced in adjusting the
accounts, owing to the Commonwealth and
Dominion Governments having relinquished
control of sugar supplies, and the “accept-
ance by Queensland of the position held by
the Federal authorities”; (2) “certain mat-
ters in connection with the winding-up of the
Fiji Cos. awaited settlement”; and (3) the
director's were considering still another share-
shuffle. Regarding the return of the Maori-
land and Fiji subsidiary’s business to the
parent, the directors announce that they
had “doubts” as to “how the assets trans-
ferred should appear in the amalgamated
balance-sheet”:—
We know no more now than we did in May, or a year
ago, what the British Government mean to do about lift-
ing the prohibition against Fiji engaging laborers in
India, and, ti l a decision has been come to, it is an
open question whether the investment in that Colony
should be set down at a figure near its cost or at
the sum that might be saved in the position that
must develop if we cannot obtain the labor needed
to keep the plantations and mills in constant work.
If Dowming-street solves the problem of the
supply of Black Brother for the co., the
directors evidently propose to value the Fiji
assets at nearer “cost” than they will do if
the British Government declines to lift the
prohibition against the engagement of coolies.
Here is the chairman’s announcement:—
Meantime, I should tell you that, if the Board
decides to advise an increase of the share capital
so as to bring this nearer in amount to the cost of
the assets used in carrying on our business, such a
change would not affect, one way or the other, the
amount of the profits to be divided among the
proprietors. In other words, • you may expect the
rate of the dividend to be the figure obtained by
dividing the profits to be distributed by the num-
ber of the shares to which it will apply.
There is an echo in that of fore-
casts which accompanied bonus issues in
the long ago. If the share-register is in-
flated to make div. rates look mild, on past
experience the co. may be relied upon to
endeavor to increase its distributions; but
whether much extra profit can now be
squeezed out of the business, and whether
the co. would be permitted to do such squeez-
ing, are matters which cannot be forecasted.
Meanwhile, for the past half-year a div. of
255. per share —£203,125, and at the rate of
121 p.c. p.a.—has been distributed. “The
amount divisible,” the directors naively
announce, “is thus again the same as that
paid in 1914 before the separation of the
cos." To appreciate how similar the div.
was, it is necessary to take into considera-
tion all happenings since 1914. The “Wild
Cat” told that story in detail on May 17
last. Among other things, it was shown
that during the past three years the co. had
returned capital totalling two millions-odd
more than the £2,425,000 of capital which
had been invested in the enterprise by share-
holders. After having received fat divs.
and had £36 10s. returned for every £2O
paid in, old , shareholders still held scrip for
3] millions against the £2,425,000 they had
paid in.

Electrolytic Zinc Cos. of Australasia.
Ltd., the amalgamation of Broken Hill and
other interests which is producing zinc at
Risdon (Tas.). The public co., which in
1920 took over a proprietary concern, be-
gan with £207,944 of capital represented by
“investigational, research and general de-
velopment work” and working debits, and

That £395,769 of profit is the hall-mark on
one of the finest achievements in the history
of Australian industry. In recent pre-war
times Continental Europe—and that was
mostly Germany—controlled zinc-production.
It held the market because it had cheap fuel
and cheap labor. The Sulphide Corp. had
established works at Seaton Carew (Eng.),
but that venture from the beginning experi-
enced troubles. The war, however, altered
everything. When Britain wanted supplies
the only source was the U.S.A., which obliged
at prices running from £33 up to £IBO per
ton. This demand resulted in the successful
development of the electrolytic process, and
Amalgamated Zinc (De Bavay’s), led by
W. L. Baillieu as the financial king-pin, and
H W. Gepp as technical expert, decided to
look into the prospects of establishing zinc-
production as an Australian industry by
utilising power from the hydro-eloetric un-
dertaking of the Speck Government. Gepp
spent four months experimenting with
Broken Hill concentrates in the U.S.A., and
then transferred operations to an experimen-
tal plant at Risdon (Tas.). Results fulfilled
hopes, and in 1918 it was decided to go ahead
and exercise the option on 30,000 electric
li.p. p.a. and proceed with the erection of
plant to produce 100 tons zinc daily. Amal-
gamated Zinc had taken up 300,000 fl
shares, and the B. 11. North and South cos.
and the Zinc Corp. each subscribed 150,000.
Next the shareholders and officials in these
tour cos. were offered 1,100,000 of fl prefs.
which carry S p.c. cumulative and the right
to follow ordinaries point for point in any
distribution above that rate. Later, £400.060-
or S p.c. lst-mortgage debs, with rights of
conversion into participating prefs were
issued In March last the works had been
expanded to absorb the full 30,000h.p. ori-
ginally contracted for, and in July a further
block of 3000h.p. was added. Lately, aver-
age daily production has been 120 tons zinc,
and manager Gepp expects to increase it to
125 tons soon.
Monthly production in the early part of
the past financial year was slightly below
OO tons.;-for June it had reached 3204
tons. Altogether 31,283 tons of excellent
quality zinc (09.95 p.c.) was turned out.
with silver-lead products, which went to the
1 lrie Smelters, containing 4344 tons lead
and 001,0820 z. silver. In addition. 78 tons
ot metallic cadmium was recovered from
the residues. Sulphuric acid is a big side-
line in Broken Hill zinc concentrates, which
have SO far provided all the feed for the Ris-
don works, and g.-m. Gepp announces a big
advance in pre-roasting processes at Broken
Hill. Pirie. Wallaroo, Port Adelaide and
Cockle Creek. Meanwhile, financial results
are justifying the optimistic anticipations
which tin; experimental work prompted. Of
course, the co. was assured an excellent mar-
ket ; the undertaking by the British Govern-
ment to purchase the Commonwealth's zinc
output for 10 years from 1918 at average
market prices plus a premium of up to £5
Per ton for high quality, put the co. on a
wonderfully easy wicket. The Electro. Zinc
accounts show a net profit of £285,406 for
the 12 months after providing £48,000 for
taxation. But £90,000 had previously been
taken for depreciation, and £20,000 more
had been appropriated to reduce the account
to which all the heavy investigation costs
had been charged. Small additions to re-
serves made the year’s total the £395,769
shown in the introductory table. During the
12 months payments to shareholders covered
pref. divs. from the commencement to Decem-
ber 31, 1922, and at the balancing date suf-
ficient profit had accumulated, after provid-
ing for depreciation and taxes, to reduce the
deficit to almost one-third of the figures of
only two years, previously. In September
the balance of divs. on prefs. to June 30
was paid, and ordinaries received their first
div. (4 p.c.). These two distributions re-
quired approximately £83,000, but it is pro-
bable that the results of operations of the
three months since the accounts closed pro-
vided all that.
The deficit of £115,876 shown in the intro-
ductory table was made up as follows:
Research and development account .. £247,132
Less Reserves—
Equalisation reserves .. £40,000'
Debenture sinking fund, . . 13,003
P. & L. balance . . . . 78,262
Deficit £115,837
That does not take into calculation £179,404
in a depreciation reserve or £2767 set aside
for renewals. Anyway, beyond disclosing the
substantial reduction of intangible assets the
figures are not of much value. Electrolytic
Zinc is not only a treatment co.; it hopes
eventually to become a big mining concern.
At the beginning it took over the Mt. Read-
Rosebery group of mines, and they stand in
the books with a value of £359,677. The co.
issued 350,000 £1 deferred ordinaries—rank-
ing for divs.- after July 31, 1925—f0r these
properties. To date the co. has depended on
Broken Hill for all its raw material; but
lately the complex ores of the Tasmanian
group have received more attention. Investi-
gation work has been in progress, and the
old Zeehan smelter is to be put into com-
mission early next year to determine what
process will give the best results. General-
manager Gepp is confident that the mining
and metallurgical possibilities will “fully
justify” the co.’s purchase of those proper-
ties. Meanwhile, having Broken Hill to
draw upon for full-capacity supplies, and
being assisted by a favorable zinc market
and a benevolent British Government as
subsidising buyer, Electrolytic Zinc is having
a great run,

Gold’s Hosiery Mills, Ltd.—The extent
to which this Sydney co. has passed into the
control of debenture-holders is disclosed by
the arrangement their committees have come
to with the management. Subject to the
approval of debenture-holders—w r ho will
meet early next month—representatives of
the 2nd and of the “C” debs, are to join the
Board. Accounts are to be made up every
six months, instead of yearly, so that the
co.’s affairs can be more closely watched,
and, at the co.’s expense, the deb.-holders
will appoint a public accountant “and/or
other experts” to see that the rights and in-
terests of holders are preserved and pro-
tected. Directors’ fees are to be restricted
to £IOOO p.a., and no divs. can be paid on
pref. or ordinary capital without the consent
of the debenture-holders’ directors. Each lot
of debentures requires £2500 interest per
quarter, and the agreement provides that the
instalments on the Seconds due on Septem-
ber 1 last and on December 1 shall be pay-
able on June 30, 1925, and the March, 1924,
instalment on June 30, 1926. Interest due
June, 1924, and thereafter is to be payable
on due dates. The interest on “C” debs.,
which fell due on November 1 this year, is to
become payable on June 30, 1926, and next
year’s February and May instalments on
June 30, 1927. From August next all “C”
interest is to be payable on due dates. This
means that the business must be conducted
so as to (1) satisfy tlie bank’s requirements
(overdraft is approximately £118,000), (2)
earn in addition £20,000 p.a. (which
amount is to be paid out in quarterly
instalments as from March next) and (3)
recover £IO,OOO of arrears by June, 1926.
The due dates for principal—2nd debs.,
December, 1928; “G" debs., August, 1927
have, of course, had to be abandoned;
it is now proposed that the Seconds
shall become payable in live annual
instalments of iiot less than £20,000
commencing from December 1. 1928, and the
"G” lot in similar instalments, the first to
be paid on December 1. 1933, one year after
the last instalment due to the 2nd debs,
should have been redeemed. Thus the re-
arrangement; provides that the last penny of
debenture debt shall become repayable nine
years later than was programmed when the
paper was issued. The outlook for the
original proprietors is, therefore, dismal;
and it cannot be too strongly stressed that
their troubles are due not so much to a set-
back in trading as to the policy of having
depended almost wholly on borrowed funds
instead of fixed capital for the development
of the business.

When the chemical trade was high on the
wave of that fictitious thing which we have
come to call war prosperity, and this co.
required extra capital to carry larger stocks
and book debts, the directors issued £25,600
of bonus scrip and invited shareholders to
put in a similar amount. But the slump
set in shortly afterwards, and though Shar-
land’s suffered no serious losses by the col-
lapse of values, the re-adjustment of prices
and continued heavy costs (taxes, in par-
ticular) curtailed profits. On the cash they
put in shareholders have been receiving divs.
at the rate of 74 and 8f p.c., but those dis-
tributions have cut into reserves for £SOOO-

The expansion of the business, coupled witli
war-time values, more than doubled stocks
between 1913 and 1920. They are now
down £40,000, and there has been a corres-
ponding reduction of liabilities. At August
31 there were stocks, book debts, War Loan
holdings and cash totalling almost £168,000
against floating debt of £50,000 and a few
hundreds. Owing to the capitalisation of
reserves four years ago, and the lean time
since, the £125,000 of paid capital is sup-
ported by only £14,753 of visible reserves.

The Farmers’ Go-operative Implement
Go., Ltd.—This is the latest move by leaders
of N. 8. Wales farmers’ associations to
develop the co-operative spirit. Gonferences
have frequently discussed the establishment
of implement works, but the difficulties of
raising sufficient capital and of overcoming
the problems of early development have been
too great. An unusual opportunity of
acquiring a going concern at a reasonable
figure has, however, occurred ; the old busi-
ness of James Martin and Go., which passed
into the hands of a public co. in 1911, is
available at a price to be calculated on the
current value of tangible assets. There is
to be no consideration whatever for goodwill.
The old co. undertook that on October 1, the
date on which the present co. took over, there
would be at least £95.336 of tangible assets
in excess of all liabilities. On that basis
they arc to receive £45,000 cash by instal-
ments extending over four years (interest at
6 p.c.), and ;>0,336 fully-paid £1 shares

n\ v rate such of the accounts of the old
co as are available show that between 1911-
1918 divs. averaged only 6 ? p.c., though
meanwhile' £20,000-odd went into
is possible also that some of the old family
interests in the business desire to »et fiee
of it. ...
The new farming interest may infuse fresh
life into the business and make it much more
profitable. There certainly are possibilities
in the scheme, provided the works are effici-
ently managed and are equipped to manu-
facture machinery which can compete suc-
cessfully with other standard makes. ike
promoters evidently . propose to launch out
with an ambitious programme: they are
offering 199,664 shares to be called, to 10s.
on allotment—“at present it is not intended
to call up more than 10s. —and if all these
are subscribed they will give i 04,000 more
than the cash required to pay the vendors.
The co. has the right, however, to purchase
at par the majority of the shares to be issued
to them. All shares are to rank alike
for divs., which are not to exceed 8 p.c. pm.
The Articles provide that surplus profits
shall go as bonuses to customers on the
amount of their purchases, share-holding
clients to receive more than non-shareholders.
4 K. Trethowan, C. J. Mcßae, F. A. Rut-
tenshaw, MX.A., F. L. Martin and John
Stinson are the first directors.
At the annual meeting in Melbourne last
week North Broken Hill shareholders decided,
bv 277,702 votes to 41,215, to buy out the
British mine and other assets on the terms
arranged by the directors. On the same day. in
Adelaide, British holders with one voice
accepted the price offered, their unanimity
suggesting that they at least thought tiey
knew which party was making the better deal.
Some of the arguments presented, however,
must have made shareholders ponder whether
things were quite what they were repre-
sented to be when the Australian co. was
promoted to buy out the English-controlled
concern only last year. In Melbourne, North
directors broke their silence to tell share-
holders all the merits of the purchase. Obvi-
ously. the North is better equipped m plant
ti squeeze more profit out of British ore
than its present owners can; for instance,
British tonnages are limited, so it would
scarcely pay it to put in a plant to treat slimes.
The North can be expected to benefit by a re-
duction of costs: ore from the British ex-
pected to increase milling to about the btMJO
tons per week which ruled in pre-war years.
Nevertheless, whether the British was worth
the price paid—particularly in respect ot
the North shares offered—depends entirely
on the metal markets of the future. It pre-
sent prices hold the deal should be a very pro-
fitable one for the North, but who can guar-
antee them? And if the British is such a
splendid proposition in 1923, why did not
the North rush the opportunity of purchas-
ing the property last year instead of allow-
ing another co., in the flotation of which
some of its directors were interested, to act
as middleman and make a big profit ?

Another Broken Hill absorption which has
been under consideration lately seems likely
to mature. The Sulphide Corp. is offering
£75,000 for the Junction mine, and both lots
of shareholders are to be called together to
discuss the nroposal. Already Sulphide mana-
ger James Hebbard is counting the chickens,
he expects to increase the Junction output
from about 500 tons weekly to 1500 tons, and
“it might even be possible for the Junction to
supply sufficient ore to. enable the Central to
run its normal capacity of an average or
2300 tons.” Almost 12 million gallons of
water per week are being poured into the
fire area of the Central, but it is doubtful
whether much of the moisture is reaching the
flames. Meanwhile the drives over an area
of 700 ft. x 300 ft. at the 100 ft. level are being
opened up to permit the installation ot per-
forated pipes, and make the saturation ot
the fire section more thorough.
Wallaroo and Moonta Cos. is to be wound-
up without delay. The recent accounts told
liow desperate the position had become, ana
Chairman Lancelot Stirling added to the
pitiful story in Adelaide on I rid ay last by
informing shareholders that, with a re-
stricted output, copper could not be pro-
duced at less than from £BO to £BS per ton.
Meanwhile, ore reserves have dwindled, ana
the prospects of opening up new payable
bodies on a large scale are not bright. Liqui-
dation will probably be followed by a
scheme to form a small co. to handle the
leavings; meanwhile water is to be kept be-
low the 700 ft. level. Under favorable con-
ditions of mining, the ore left cannot show
much, if any, profit in the present copper
market, and there does not appear to be
much likelihood of an early improvement.
The U.S.A. mines are supplying all require-
ments and squeezing a profit on present low
prices, and so long as those conditions con-
tinue and the demand does not improve,
there is little hope for Commonwealth mines
which cannot adjust their costs to the
market.

With the collapse of Wallaroo and
Moonta, the only important mining enter-
prise in South Aus. comes to an end. The
big central State has always been short ot
coal, and gold and silver-lead, though found
all about, have seldom been in quantities
that paid. Copper has been its strong suit.
Kapunda started about 1542, and lasted some
40 years. Burra had a working life ot
30 years. Wallaroo and Moonta, separ-
ately and amalgamated, have had a run of
60 years. Unless other arrangements are
made to dig out the copper ores, the leading
mineral products of the State will for the
future be salt and ironstone.
“Kickeroo”: Britain, wanting to shake
free of Government activities in business, has
contracted itself out of the spelter-purchase
agreement into which it was wheedled
when patriotism. was the cry. A deliciously
ambiguous statement from the Electrcuytic
Zinc leaves a doubt as to what W. L. Baii-
lieu really did arrange when m the fulness ot
his heart he compromised with the British
Government. What he didn t fail to do was,
to use his own words, to satisfy himselt
“that the terms offered full compensation to
Electrolytic Zinc for the modifications in tlie
contract.” As the curtain lias never been
raised to disclose actual terms of the origi-
nal agreements, that statement doesn t un-
ravel anything. Interpreting some further
ambiguity, it looks as if Baillieu s battling
for full compensation meant that Electroly-
tic Zinc got 400*000 tons zinc concentrates
as a job-lot, in addition to 750,000 tons con-
centrates bought when zinc was at its low-
est. It is not made clear, either, whether
the British Government, by hopping out ot
spelter “for an equivalent consideration
offered in the direction of an extension ot
the concentrates purchase contract,” has ex-
tended the original 10 years’ contract to buy
300,000 tons zinc concentrates annually, or
has only agreed to give back 400,000 tons
concentrates already bought from Broken
Hill. When will the full details of that
famous patriotic zinc contract be made avail-
able as a war document, disclosing how
creditable (or otherwise) it was to tlie Gom-
monwealtli ?
Tlie Westralian Government has given
Jack McDermott an assurance that a rail-
way will be pushed through to the W lluna
field if development is satisfactory and it
£300,000 of working capital is put up. Io
begin with, bores are to be put down to con-
firm values obtained by diamond-drilling by
previous owners; McDermott proposes to
push ahead with that work at once. He con-
siders prospects good: he believes that two
millions’ worth of gold can be won within
four years of the date when treatment be-
gins, and expects to open up 400,000 tons
ore for every 100 ft. of sinking.

Kanowna Red Hill (W.A.) is much im-
proved. Recent development has shown that
vertical shear-zones occur in a great dyke of
porphyry, and that within these gold lies in
fair quantities. The Melba reef is the only
one of the Red Hill’s numerous veins worked
in the newly-discovered zone, and the ex-
ploration in this ground of Tom Doyle s
famous leader and of tlie Kanowna reel,
both of which overlie the Melba, is expected
to result in good finds. Meanwhile the co.
is steadily adding to its banking account
with proceeds from crushings.
Boulder Perseverance’s revival is attri-
buted in London to the good work done by
retiring-liquidator C. F. Bell, and at a meet-
ing held there last month shareholders
unanimously voted him an honorarium of
2000 guineas. Bell took over the old co.
in 1917. and by putting in tributors paid
shareholders 2s. 3d. per share. The new
co. took over the mine about two months
ago, and there are now 2,500,000 shares to
feed.
South Lucknow (N.S.W.) is making a
fifth call of 3d. on its 100,000 .contnbs. The
new mainshaft has reached 210 ft., and at
200 ft. a crosscut is being run in south-west
to pick up the veins cut at 125 ft. in tlie
workings from the old shaft. At 80ft. in
the crosscut serpentine and calcite veins
show up, and the contact. or joint is ex-
pected ill another 40ft. Drives each way to
locate the spurs will be the policy so soon
as the contact has been reached. The show
is still purely a prospecting one, but it is
in a classical locality.

In the erection of mining plants the men
on the spot are usually poor judges of time
required. Manager Ireland forecasted that
five head of stamps would be m commission
at Vimy Ridge, Tathra (N.S.W.), early m
November; but they will do little before
Christmas. Meanwhile, the mine opens well,
the reef in the tunnel having widened to
10ft. and the new shaft on the cap of the
hill is in solid mineralised ore at 40ft.
Latest clean-up at Carter’s Hill. Hockley
(N.S.W.) , was 73 tons for not quite 300 z.,
or about 9dwt. At that rate the 5-lid. bat-
tery will have to be supported by calls to
finance development.
The latest development at the Big Ben,
Gundagai (N.S.W.), is a bailiff, and unless
two Gundagai creditors are paid off by noon
to-morrow (Friday) the auctioneer’s ham-
mer will ring the passing knell.

Queensland’s mineral production this year
is keeping just ahead of the figures for 1922.
For the quarter ended Sept. 30 last produc-
tion was £207,489, apart from gold and coal.
The advance is due to cobalt, arsenic and lead.
Cobalt figures at 32 tons worth £6384. Arsenic
has run into about twice the 1922 output, and
Chillagoe’s lead production increased £7OOO
on the quarter. Tin has fallen back slightly,
although Herberton has made a very credit-
able recovery.

Charters Towers organised an indignation
meeting last week on receipt of a curt tele-
gram from the Mines Department intimating
that the free diamond-drilling campaign was
to be discontinued. The fact that driller Sand-
stedt had just been sent up from Gympie to
replace Berry gave rise to the belief that the
plant ivas on the field for a much longer
run. To date about 1900 ft. has been drilled,
with very little encouragement. The Gov-
ernment Geologist was well slathered foi
recommending that work should stop, but as
a matter of fact the committee has had a
very fair run on its favorite spots. Any-
how, there seemed to be a political flavor
about the campaign, as it started a few
iveeks before the last election, and it was
freely stated on the Towers that it wouldn t
run very long after the polls. That it lias
been kept on so long is possibly due to labor
pressure, for the outlook is pretty black for
the unions there.
The Queensland Government is pushing on
prospecting work on its Nightflower leases,
near Chillagoe. There are three State leases
totalling 42 acres, the central one having a
large prospective value, as it lies betiveen
the original syndicate’s areas,_ and there
are good shows of ore on both sides. In the
southern leases trenching has located the
line of reef and disclosed carbonates with
high silver values.

Good stone in the winze 70ft. below the
1520 ft. level at the Hercules has brightened
the prospects of that Bendigo Amalgamated
pup. The driving of levels from the bottom
of a winze so situated, however, means ex-
pcnsiA'e mining. The only way out is to
sink the shaft another 100 ft. While this is
being done the drives either way from the
winze bottom will demonstrate the length of
the shoot, and tonnages to be developed. A
trial lot of 22 tons from the drive south
yielded 80oz. At the 1320 ft. level 206 tons
from the south stopes returned 184 oz. 15dwt.
Ajax remains the one mine of Daylesford
(Vic.). Its last clean-up, 6330 z. from
981 tons, including mineral, produced another
shilling div. for shareholders. This makes
£5 ss. the little co. has distributed since its
second advent under Tom Harvey and
Buchanan a decade ago. Although ore re-
serves are small to-day, the market keeps up,
because no one dares spec. Ajax any more
than trifle with the Morning Star. Wood’s
Point. Scrip is in the bag, and a few thou-
sand shares oversold would mean a skirl of
the pipes and a stiff bear squeeze. Tom
Proctor is Avorking hard to graft a market
upon South Ajax. Sinking has been going
on to open up anew No. 6 level, and every-
one is in great heart, because a color or two
was got in stone cut in the well. In another
20ft. of driving the face should reach the new
shoot and justify Proctor’s belief that there
was at least a gamble in the old claim. Ajax
North, under Jensen, only about pays Avages,
though there is plenty of stone and posts
have been cut to the bone. What a stringer
the claim has been, even though propped
by the talent of Dalrymple, Ted Ward and
Arthur Vickery!

Doc. Prichard, of Torquay Oil. and PI. S.
Lyne both have something to say about the
seep on the Glenelg River. Prichard’s lan-
guage is technical: “the seepage is an exuda-
tion of a natural crude petroleum which has
found its way to the surface through block-
faulting across the valley The discovery
is of the greatest importance as illustrative
of the prospective value of the tertiary mea-
sures of the State in mineral oil.” Lyne
declares that the three factors necessary for
oil occurrence are present: (1) Petroleum
has been formed; (2) there is a suitable
anticlinal structure; and (3) suitable cap
rocks are present. Tlie analysis of the seep
samples by the Yic. Mines Department dis-
closes a heavy paraffin and asphaltic base
crude-petroleum oil. When Dod went to
peg out for the S.A. Oil Wells, Connolly’s
Point Addis spotter was also on the job. So
instead of the co. taking up a lease extending
on both sides of the Glenelg River, it
selected the seep block on the one bank,
while Connolly’s man pegged the area oppo-
site. Prichard also has leases for his Tor-
quay crowd.

“Blanc" : Rue de Ivanga, at I’oronne, was

big letters: “Ilopoutere”? I was there for

christenings to parade?
“Quack”: Births of Australian infants
in suburban trains, trams and cabs, at
parties, on racecourses, and, in one case, in
the vestibule of a picture-theatre, have been
reported in the past. Sydney now possesses
a morsel of humanity who has every right
to call himself a son of the sea. His mother
was merrily disporting herself in the surf
when the realisation of approaching mater-
nity came to her, and some women helped her
into the nearest shelter. The boy’s future, it is
to be hoped, will not be clouded by his hav-
ing been saddled with the second name of

“Harry J.”: Smithy was quite blind in
one eye; and it was in the billets near Albert
he told ns how he’d got past the doctor. “I
walked into the camp at Dubbo one morn-
in’,” he recounted, "and was turned down
on account o’ bad eyesight. Later in the day
I got drinkin’, and a. bloke jobbed me in
the blind eye and give me a beauty. Next
day I shaves off me moustache, gives meself
a new name and lines up at the camp again.
The doc. sez lie couldn’t expect a man to
see out of a eye like that, but he’d take me
word that it wuz a good ’nn."
“F.A.”: Passing through a town iu the
south-west of N.S.W. recently I met an
ex-Digger I knew in Alex, in 'l5, and was
invited out to his
homestead, so m e
24 miles from the
rail. At dinner-
time lie piloted me
towards a light on
the far side of the
g a l- den, w here
there was a kind
of alcove, in which
a well - equipped
table was set.
So m e palms on
stands stood in the
corners, and a pun-
gent aroma was in
the air, taking me
back a few years
to the uncertain
Egyptian nights. I
smiled when my
host pointed to a
faded notice over
the entrance: “Offi-
cers Only.” “Ever

“Now. let's have an

complete.”
The office Savonarola thunders forth: —
The Argus was rightly annoyed by the small
fine which was imposed last week on a man who
“illegally used” a stranger's motor-car —in plain
terms, pinched it —and then pleaded drunkenness.
In Sydney, in an era which was more logical if less
merciful, a jury convicted a drunk of murder for
killing a fellow-drunk in a lock-up, though it was
established that the accused had been very inebriated
indeed at the time. This was on the sound prin-
ciple that a man who is guilty of a wrong action
is responsible for all the results of it.
Our tolerant attitude towards the drunk is an
unreasoning inheritance from the 18th century, when
FACT Y. FICTION.
“Well, anyhow, you don’t love me as much as you did when we
were just engaged.”
“Oh, don’t be silly; I don’t talk so much about it, mebbe.”
sobriety was unfashionable. Nobody really loves
a drunk nowadays. In trains and trams, on ferry-
boats and sidewalks, at social functions and so on
he is dodged as assiduously as the well-washed
modern citizen would avoid one of those ladies of
Louis NlV.’s day “who washed all over but once
yearly.” But an imbecile habit persists of referring
to him in the abstract (that is to say, when the
object-lesson of his revolting presence is absent) as
something lovable or humorous or heroic. A piti-
able reaction to this convention is the bogus drunk —
usually a chinless lad in the early twenties who,
filled with milk-shake and the histrionic spirit,
reels about in simulated intoxication at most holiday
resorts. A more serious phenomenon is the genuine
boy drunk, who, in at least 90 per cent, of cases,
has taken too much under the delusion that bestiality
is a sympton of a stout and manly heart.
Judges and magistrates would do the community
a vast service if they resolved unitedly to execute
a complete volte face as regards their handling of
those who plead intoxication in mitigation of crimes
If, in every case, the Bench weighed in with a par-
ticularly stiff penalty, plus a short homily, for publi-
cation in the press, on the, essential loathsomeness,
mental and physical, of drunks, the unthinking thou-
sands who regard the swilling of alcohol as in some
way admirable would begin to acquire a saner view-
point. The wowsers mean well in this connection
—but they are wowsers. As a matter of fact, a
prime reason for such false popularity as the boozer
does enjoy lies in the circumstance that his chief
critics are folks with the white-choker and cotton-
glove habit.
“Howitzer”: This was the queerest
wound in all my experience. The bullet
penetrated the frontal bone and came out
at the right temple. Glancing on the inner
rim of tlie stricken man’s steel helmet, it
entered again over the right ear and made
exit at the back of the head. Then the
persevering bit of lead had a third try, re-
entering at the back of the left ear and
finishing up by protruding a quarter of an
inch from the left temple. The per-
forated victim was semi-conscious, and lay
in the shell-hole for 12 hours before we got
him to the aid-post. The M.O. shook his
head over the case: yet this ex-Dig. is now
swinging a Kelly in the big timber around
Atherton (N.Q.).
“Ilobnobster”: 'Ware these private
detective agencies! A woman friend of mine
engaged a firm of Sherlock Holmeses to keep
her wayward spouse under observation, and
subsequently, on the strength of its report,
instituted proceedings for divorce. The
case being set. down for trial, the firm was
notified that its watchers would be required
to give evidence in court. In reply the peti-
tioner’s solicitors received the intimation
“that the gentlemen who conducted the in-
quiries for your client have since left our
employ, without advising us of their subse-
quent intentions. We understand, however,
that they are somewhere in Queensland, and
if you feel that, their services are indispen-
sable we feel confident that our staff of ex-
perts would be able to trace them, and serve
the necessary subpoenas.” And it was
added in a whisper that the firm would be
satisfied with a fee of £4O for this pursuit
of its own agents.

“1!olein” : Pie is a country bank manager
in the Ma State’s nor’-west, and is noted tor
his propriety and reserve. The other after-
noon a client, meeting him outside the bank,
introduced him to a couple newly arrived
from the Cold Country. The lady volubly
explained to the banker that she liked their
new sphere except for the mosquitoes, raising
her veil to show the ravages of the pest. The
husband suggested a refresher, and steps
were turned towards the hotel where the
newcomers were staying, the buxom English-
woman leading the way through the hall to
the private parlor, and continuing her tirade
against the disturbers of her rest. “It
wouldn’t be so bad,” she declared, “if they
stopped at your face. But they don’t. See
here” —and before the astonished financier
could articulate a protest, the lady had
proved it. Tie recovered sufficiently after
liis whisky to regain the sanctuary of his
office, but the typiste confided to the teller
that afternoon that she didn’t know what
was the matter with the boss—“his mind
didn’t seem to be on his work.”
“T.P.”: The kiddies of the Mitta Mitta
State School (Vic.), in a nook far back in
the Australian Alps, levelled a hit of ground
in their mountain fastness to serve as a
tennis “court,” sewed some bags together for
a “net,” went bush for suitable saplings as
supports, and finally hawked the few vege-
tables iu their school plots and got “rnore’n
five shillings” for them. To this they added
the pence in their money-boxes as the
nucleus of a fund designed to purchase some
time in the future dinkum racquets, net and
balls. Then the .Tap earthquake occurred,
and a voluntary mass meeting dumped the
entire bank of copper into the lap of the
local schoolmaster “for the poor Japs.” They
reckoned manfully they could worry along
for the present with kerosene-tin bats, bag
nets and rounder balls. But the story of
their self-sacrifice got about, and they have
since received from sympathetic souls in
Melbourne, Ballarat and elsewhere no less
than five racquets, some balls and a whole
£lO “for a decent court.” Last. Sunday a
visiting clergyman preached from the text,
“Cast thy bread upon the waters,” but Mitta
youngsters are still wondering what all the
fuss is about.
“Bush-Cat”: Ever hear of a bride being
lost on the way home? It happened on the
Lower Darling a while ago. The sergeant
of police had officiated at the ceremony,
which passed off with the usual eclat. After-
wards a good supply of liquid refreshments

was packed aboard a sulky, the bridegroom
and his best man took their seats, the lady
was stowed in at the back, and a start was
made tor home, about 15 miles out. The
bride opened the first two gates all right,
but was missing at the third, having appa-
rently fallen out an route. It wasn’t till
next morning that the husband and his off-
sider, who had been at some pains, after
discovering the loss, to keep up their spirits
with stimulants, went back to retrieve their
vanished passenger. They found her safe,
camped with some woodcutters on the river
bank, but in a very bad temper over being
deserted so early in her married life.

COMBING THE UNDERWORLD.
[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
“The biggest police drive ever organised has been
taking place in Sydney, 50 detectives and many
plain-clothes constables being engaged from morn-
ing to night. Never has the underworld had such a
combing. Many minor crooks have been captured,
but the notorious Buckley, wanted in connection with
the Glenferrie (tic.) murder, evades arrest.”
A million people, more or less, in Sydney there may
be,
And few of them that someone wouldn't dearly love
to see,
But none for just a glimpse of whom so many
searchers yearn,
Whose whereabouts the object is of such intense
concern.
They're ferreting the warrens out iu Glebe and
Waterloo,
Around the Out and Miller’s Point their labors they
pursue,
And Ultimo’s recesses are being dusted through and
through,
For they’re combing out the underworld for
Buckley.
Some break for open country when the hue-and-cry
grows hot,
But the swarming human anthill may provide a safer
spot.
So the sleuths of Law are tracking, scenting, quarter-
ing- tlie town,
From the fastnesses of Pyrmont to the lairs of
Cam perdown.
Did they glimpse him on the Corso? Was lie sighted
on the Quay ?
In the dingy lanes of lied fern does he lurk, a refugee?
Keep an eye for wrist tattoo-marks on your tram-
car vis-<i-vis,
While they scour Alsatia end to end for Buckley.
’Tisn’t likely that he lies perdu in Mosman or
Cremorne,
But fast through throbbing Newtown ’tecs in motor-
cars are borne;
Many a conscience-stricken burglar gloomy appre-
hension fills
As, the chase goes sweeping onwards through the
deeps of Surry Hills.
Many a common crook is gathered in an unexpected
net,
Many a moderately tranquil household's tenor is
upset,
But the Biggest Game’s elusive and they haven’t
got him —yet
Though they’re raking through the underworld for
Buckley.

“Quack”: Sir William Maeewen, Kings
Surgeon, here for the Medical Conference,
was the first man to demonstrate that the
thorax could be opened without the lungs
collapsing; he showed also that the elabo-
rate pressure chambers at one time used
in thoracotomy were unnecessary. That
discovery was responsible, for at least one
remarkable operation during the war. A
Digger with a smashed leg, which had to be
removed, collapsed under an an (esthetic. His
thorax was cut open and his heart pul-
sated by the surgeon’s hand, and life was
restored. The resurrected Billjim lived for
more than a day, and it was claimed in the
ambulance diary (I think the 13th Field
Ambulance, A.1.F.) that mortification of
the wounded leg was the cause of death.

“Patrick” : Hickson the Healer isn't hav-
ing things all his own way in his Maoriland
tour. You see, he is interfering with a
well-established local industry. Katana, the
Maori miracle man, has very considerable
reputation in the same line, and that he
and his friends resent competition is evi-
denced by the special gatherings which have
been organised to clash with the Hickson
itinerary. Assemblages of five to ten thou-
sand are quite common at Ratana’s camp,
and his supporters, when they want to be
particularly nasty, claim that he produces
the goods “without resort to vulgar hysteria.”
There is no sending round the hat, either ;
indeed, the Maori healer often feeds a large
portion of the crowd that seeks his touch.

“Stellsby”: A recent, cable tells of three
intrepid Irishmen whose 12-ton yacht,
Saoirse, safely weathered the stretch be-
tween the Cliannel and Cape Town, and
who “hope to reach Maoriland before Christ-
inas.” I’ll he more than surprised if they
reach there at all. I’ve made the easting
from the Cape a score of times. When I
learn that a 12-ton hooker has lived through
that 5000-odd miles, of westerly fury running
anywhere between the 40tli and 50th paral-
lef I’ll begin to think that I’ve never been to
sea, but only dreamt it. Admittedly the
navigators of the tiny Saoirse could take a
northerly course and get through, hut ad-

The three Townsville ysuths who stole a “flattie”
and set off for Papua with two kerosene-tins of
water, a dead goat and a map from a school atlas
as equipment (B. l/11/’23) were plagiarists of sorts.
THE COMFORTER.
PROUD FIANCEE: "Every time he hisses me I just close my eyes, and ”
HER FRIEND: “Oh, hut you'll soon yet used to him, dear."
Some years ago a party of Brisbane (‘gentlemen
adventurers” tried the: same trick on a much larger
scale. Selecting- one of the biggest and best-fitted
of Brisbane’s power yachts, which was lying at a
Breakfast Creek anchorage, they laid their plans to
run past the Solomons and finally make a landfall
at the Marshalls or Carolines. For weeks they
bought every imaginable article of tucker or equip-
ment they thought they might need, and, on the
eve of their departure, their cash having run short,
they robbed a gunshop of arms and ammunition
and stole what petrol they thought .necessary. The
craft was loaded one dark night and was soon
over Cape Moreton bar. But the crew had forgotten
one essential —lubricating oil. When the bearings
ran dry, in desperation they tried canned dripping.
They struck a heavy head wind, the crank shafts
threw tiie dripping all over the engine-room and
finally the engines stopped. It was a very seasick
and sorry crew that drifted hack under sail to the
Queensland coast near Maryborough, to be seized
by the Law. The late Judge Cooper tried the case,
and, true to his reputation, put the boot well into
the ringleader and g-ave his dupes a light run.
Nothing that ’S’onah said from the bench equalled
the remarks of the yacht’s owner when he saw the
dreadful plight to which his beautiful little vessel
had been reduced.
“Harold Hardnpp”: The Japanese earth-
quake seems to have been prolific of bath-
room episodes. The latest story is of a lady
who, bathing on an upper floor, was preci-
pitated into the presence of a gentleman
just emerging from the shower on the floor
below. He climbed up and rescued her from
where she was precariously clinging to a
rafter; together they escaped, waded into
the water, and were finally rescued by one
of the vessels in the harbor. In the stress
of such a moment of excitement the worst
embarrassment can be overlooked; but it
sometimes comes afterwards. Two passen-
gers were in their baths at the time of the
Elingamite wreck, and in the hurry and
consternation came face to face in as much
clothing as Adam and Eve wore in Eden.
The scandalised society in which they moved
decreed, when it heard the story, that the
fractured conventions could only be re-knit
by a wedding—which, by the way, turned
out very happily. On the other hand a
lady who was rescued from a burning Auck-
land hotel in a state of extreme undress was
so annoyed at being seen in that condition
that she never again spoke to her rescuer,
who had previously been an intimate friend.
“Homfrey Beale”: Up our way there is
a man who sells firewood by the load.. At
one place he serves there is keen rivalry
between two damsel employees for his heart
and banking account, and whenever he ap-
pears there is a brisk contest to engage him
in coquettish conversation. The usual tri-
angular shooting was in progress the other
day while the coveted prize was throwing
off his wood. Suddenly Bill sprang from
the cart, slung his braces from his shoulders,
threw off his shirt, and began to lower his
bifurcations. The rivals fled in maidenly
perturbation, and did not reappear during
his stay. On his next visit, however, both
renewed the siege. The quick-chanse artist
blushed and stammered for awhile, then
got it off his chest with a run: “I must
apologise for what happened last time, girls,
but it’s no time to be particular when a six-
inch centipede has dropped down your back
and is making for your boots.” What should
a gentleman do in such a case? And what
would Mr. Davey Hall do?
"Rivorina”: The long-standing Mac-
Donaid-Cainpbell feud that burst out in the
massacre of Glencoe still flourishes in parts
of Maoriland. One old Mac—a large land-
holder in the South Island —is particularly
bitter, and in addition has a miraculously
keen nose for a Campbell. Not long ago a
man approached his homestead in search
of harvesting work. As he came close Mac
bellowed: “Yon man’s a Campbell!" Inter-
rogation proved him right, and the stranger
was pushed on, although hands were badly
needed.

“Cobba-Cobba” : “Bouragi” (B. 11/10/’23)
mentions the “paying-off officer” in connection
with the reimbursement of Papuan laborers
for their toil. Storekeeping on Woodlark l£
years ago, I paid off hundreds of fuzzy-heads
and never once in the presence of a Govern-
ment rep. Entitled to £6 worth of trade
goods for 12 months’ service (2s. 6d. a week),
the natives recruited from other islands forma
it very easy to burst
up the first fiver, but
the spending of the
last few shillings was
a long and tedious
ordeal; and with 50
or GO nigs haggling,
picking, choosing, re-
jecting, and most of
the time seeking a
chance to pinch some-
thing, it taxed the
patience and nerves of
a healthy human, let
alone a malaria-sodden
wreck. A duplicate
list of each boy’s pur-
chases had to be made
out, and then the
storekeeper acc.o m-
panied the natives to
the Warden’s office.
Here every boy’s stock
was overhauled and
checked with the
docket. The posses-
sion of surplus stock
required a satisfactory
explanation, or the
owner found himself
left behind to do a
month on the “Gub’-
ment” roads, while
his honest brothers
sailed homewards. The
‘'signing-off” process,
which cost the respec-
tive employers a bob a
head, came next; and a final 10s. was col-
lected from the boy’s old employer to pay
the fare back home.
“Schnorrer” explains the trials of Jewry:
Australian Jewry grows concerned about “kosher’
from time to time. The “Kasruth” or Koshei lavs
are a vital part of the orthodox religion of the
Chosen, and many claim that the uniformly good
health of the race and its vigorous Survival is
largely due to them. But kosher is too frequently
disregarded because it is a heavy tax on the Jew s
pocket. A “Shechita” Board licenses a certain
number of butchers as “kosher,” and the butchers
make the orthodox Jews pay for their orthodoxy.
For instance, durirg the last New Year Festival, the
price of kosher chickens climbed from 3s. 6d. to
Bs. 6d. This sort of profiteering has driven so many
Jews from the koshei' butchers that recently, m
Newtown (Sydney), a Shomar Kasruth Chevra
(Society to Watch Kosher) was founded, and the
Australian Jewish Chronicle called it “a pitiful
necessity.” To wipe out. what the Jews consider a
reproach it is now proposed to start a big central
shop, with a delivery system, at which kosher meat,
and poultry will be retailed at ordinary prices, with
a bonus paid back to customers on co-operative lines.
Not only will there be a shomar 1 on the premises,
but, in addition, an official licensed to “porge”—
purging being the removal of veins in the buttock,
which removal makes the hindquarters lawfully eat-
able by the faithful, A kosher restaurant will be
the next thing.
* * * *
“Hanno”: Of the 2500-odd practitioners
whose names appear on the. N. S. Wales
Medical Register, only 1400 are graduates of
the three Australian Universities possessing
medical schools. Some 1100 persons hold
British degrees and diplomas, and there are
about 50 from foreign universities, mostly of
the U.S.A. While we permit doctors with
American qualifications to come here and
enter into competition with our own, no Aus-
tralian medico would have any hope of ob-
taining registration in the United States un-
less lie sat for and passed one of that coun-
try’s qualifying examinations. Of course,
there is a reciprocal arrangement between
the British and Australian Medical Boards;
hut what is the “reciprocity" worth —how
many Australian doctors go to England to
start in practice?
* * * *
“Picko” : Is there room for a last word on
the much-criticised cold steel? Lone Pine
proved the worth of the bayonet; without
its help the First Brigade would have been
in a mess live minutes after the hop-over.
The Turks outnumbered our boys by about
six to one, and in a straight-out rifle duel
the odds would have been overwhelming on
Jolmny. The first two trenches were packed
with Turks ready to meet the charge, hut the
bayonet proved too much. The sight of the
Diggers jumping down amongst them, and
the steel sinking into the vitals of the fore-
most. decided the Abduls and Hamids. They
chucked tlieir job and cleared, leaving their
: cobbers three deep in the trenches. The
bayonet has. and always will have, its uses.
To utterly discard it would be extreme folly.
THE TEST OF COURAGE.
BINKS (discussing the wedding of a returned man ): “Well, I
wish them Inch. Rone but the brave deserve the fair,
you know."
SPINKS (moodily reminiscent ): “Yes, and none but the brave
can live with some of them!"
“Nuggetty”: Those pars, about girl-
packers who, use their firm’s wares to adver-
tise their own yearnings for eligible suitors
set me thinking of Smith. About 15 years
ago this particular youth was working for
an orchardist at Harcourt (Vic.). One day,
when packing apples for export, he wrote a
short note saying he was anxious for a wife,
and asking any English girl who might get
the note to write, as Australian girls
didn’t appeal to him. Wrapped round an
apple, the invitation went on its way, and
in due course was published in an English
county paper. By the next mail Smith was
astonished to receive 156 letters from Eng-
lish girls of all sorts, sizes, ages, complexions
and creeds. Some enclosed photos, and
nearly all were apparently prepared to pack
up and come to Harcourt forthwith.
THE TEST.
[FOR THE BULLETIN. ]
“He was stunned and it was at first thought
his arm was broken. It was found however, tnat
he could bend the elbow. —Evening news.
When the accident has happened,
And the white-faced people bend
O'er the poor, smashed, bleeding ruin
Of the man who was their friend,
Then’s the time to pass the whisper
“Have a drink, mate?’’ in his car.
If he tries to bead the elbow
There is little cause to fear.
If there's chance of life within him
It will show a little smile
On his lips, and you can save him
And repair him in a style.
But if lie takes no notice
When the magic words are said—
If he cannot bend the elbow —
Draw the blinds! the man is dead!

About a good man gone :
Andrew Bonar Law, who died of cancer of the
throat last week, was the sort of Scotchman who
may be found at the head of things all over the
world. No one quite knows how they get there, lie
started his career in the aristocratic and convention-
bound House of Commons of 23 years ago under
every handicap but that of poverty. He was “a
colonial.” He had not been to a Public School;
worse, he had been “finished” at the Glasgow High
School. Jle was destitute of the social graces and
of any vestige of humor, and he had a Scotch accent.
Yet he scored from the first moment of his first
speech, and went on to outdistance such sen-
sationally gifted characters as Winston Churchill and
the Cecils and to gain a prize which proved out
of the reach of a great popular figure and terri-
torial magnate like Lord Derby. Is is absurd to
Melbourne's new Town Clerk McCALL, a
very busy man during the police strike
in his neighborhood.
up one who did so much, and who finally
chieved the crowning glory of a tomb in West-
minster Abbey, in the phrase which E. T. Raymond
plied to him—“decent mediocrity.” There are
Napoleons of character as well’ as of intellect, and
Bonar Law seems to have been one of them. Bonar
Law was the expression in excelsis of Scotch hard-
headedness, reasonableness and straightness.
From a land of sudden Ministries: —
Belton (Lands) is the oldest member of the Speck’s
new Labor Ministry. He is in the middle sixties
and wears one of the only pair of ziffs in the Assem-
bly. Shoobridge ambushes behind the other. Bel-
ton was popular as a Minister in the Earle Govern-
ment (1914-16), when it fell to his lot to start
the big hydro-electric show as a State concern, and
to increase the National Park to a fine sweep of
lake, mountain and forest nearly 4000 acres in
extent. Premier Lyons, like Belton, has been in
Parliament since 1909 and has also had a couple of
years’ Ministerial experience. He was Treasurer and
Railways Minister in the Earle Government. Allan
Guy, the new Chief Sec., is the youngest man who
ever filled the job. He got into the Assembly a
couple of Parliaments ago, largely because he was
the son of a popular Labor dad, the late Senator
James Guy. The youth followed the Senator as
general secretary of the Tas. A.L.P. He is still
in the thirties. Attorney-General Ogilvie is also
youthful. This is his second Parliament. He is
the only lawyer in the House and is a person of push.
Alfred O’Brien, the secretary of the Musi-
cals’ Union, just dead in Melbourne, missed
political honors mainly because of his re-
fusal to kow-tow to the cliques which sway
Labor affairs. In his youth lie was an all-
round sport; as a cyclist he won a Sydney
Thousand, and he promoted the first of the
continuous cycling carnivals. At one stage
his union lost his services, but it went so
badly on the rocks that an appeal was made
to him to return, and he put matters straight
again. He was, at £6OO p.a., the highest-
paid union official in Australia; and as he
was a competent advocate, and saved law-
yers’ fees, his members opined that lie earned
his money.
The death of William Jenkins, one-time
owner of Nangus station —a big acreage in
those days—on the
Murrumbidgee, be-
tween Junee and
Gundagai, calls up
some interesting
vital statistics.
Though he was 77.
his mother is still
alive. She is an
Australian native,
102 years of age,
and lives at Epp-
ing (N.S.W.). .Jen-
kins was one of a
family of 17, and
he and his wife
(who survives him)
had 21 children, the
first 17 being boys.
GEO. LAFFER,
Minister for Lands
and Immigration
in South Aus.
Simpson Newland, who was 88 on Novem-
ber 2, is still active about the streets of
Adelaide. Staffordshire born, he came to
South Aus. as a child, as a youth drove
sheep and cattle across the continent from
Sydney to Encounter Bay, and later became
a squatter on the Darling. He turned bis
knowledge of pioneer days into a book, “Pav-
ing the Way,” which is one of tlie dozen
most notable Australian novels. He had
a few years in S.A. Assembly in the ’eighties,
becoming Treasurer in a John Downer Min-
istry, and strenuously advocating the rail-
way across the continent to Darwin to be
built on the land-grant principle. His later
years have been busy with a number of
associations and Boards, and he is anxious
to live to see the question settled of a proper
deep-water port somewhere at the mouth of
the Murray.
Captain Thomas Langley Webb, one of
the managing directors of' the Huddart
Parker shipping and coal co., died in Syd-
ney last week, aged 65. The Webbs go back
a long way in Australian shipping. T. J.
Parker started in business in Geelong in
1553, and next year was appointed local
agent for the steamer Express, which Captain
William Howard Smith and his partner, S.
B. Skinner, the engineer, had just brought
from England. The original Webb joined
her as chief officer; and later, when Howard
Smith bought the You Yangs to go into the
inter-State trade, Webb became captain of
the Express. In 1867 Skinner died; and
John Traill and Webb bought his share.
Parker was the other partner: he had bought
Howard Smith’s share. The Huddarts
brought the coal agency into the firm in
1876. The just-dead T. L. Webb —-a
son of the original Webb —was at sea
on the firm’s ships till 1900; then he
settled down to a shore job. watching par-
ticularly the ever-growing colliery interests
of the co.
Henry Ilampson. who died lately in Adel-
aide at 63, was a business man who gave all
his spare time to military work. He raised
and equipped a small force entirely off his
own bat 40 years ago when the Russian scare
was on, and later occupied all kinds of posi-
tions under Downes, Lovely and Madley. He
worked up to a colonelcy, and during the war
had charge of the censorship staff in Adel-
-5 aide.
i W. A. Boland, of Binda station, Goola-
■ gong, one of the pioneers of the Grenfell
■ (N.S.W.) district, who passed out the other
• day at Go, was a native of Bald Hills, and
: formerly owned Grantwood station, near
l Binda, whereon there were some lively scenes
f during the shearers’ strike about a quarter
i of a century ago. Boland married one of
i the Sussex-street Foleys, of Sydney, and the
i police magistrate who was accidentally shot
l at Dubbo a while back was his brother.
1 After 50 years of dairy-farming George
' Couch, of Shellharbor (N.S.W.), has Called
; it a day. Besides attending to Strawberry
| he found time to help organise the cockies
who formed the now very important Coastal
1 Farmers’ Co-operative Society, Ltd. Likc-
wise an odd racehorse or two were kept
’ about the place, the best-known being
! Empress, with which he won several events.
He was 82 when brother-farmer Abraham
. called.
There is mourning for Mary Frances
McGuigan, Superior-General of the Sisters
of Charity in Australia, who has died at
the age of 81. Joining up in her ’teens, in
1861, she was given full sway 36 years ago,
and such was the capacity of this young Aus-
tralian that she held the job almost till the
end. The organisation of hospitals—St.
Vincent’s here and in Melbourne—and edu-
cational institutions is the long suit of these
nuns, who started in Australia, five in num-
ber. when the Francis Spaiglit landed them
with Bishop Ullathorne in 1838.
Tommy Walker, the Westralian Labor
member, was the other day carpeted on a
complaint that his advocacy of prohibition
was likely to disrupt the party, but was told
by the State Labor executive that he was
within his rights. Last century Tommy was
member for Northumberland in the N.S.W.
Assembly; but he wasn’t a prohibitionist
then. He has made a recovery that any man
might be proud of.
“D.D.”: An Aslifield (N.S.W.) picture-
show proprietor recently offered a £5 prize
for the largest family in the municipality.
The winners were Mr. and Mrs. J. Delaney,
whose quiverful is intact with 19 —11 sons
and 8 daughters, the youngest being 14.
There were no multiple births, and there
have been no deaths. The parents are Aus-
tralian-born, and lived and reared their
family in the Parramatta and Bankstown
districts. Of the 19 five daughters and six
sons are married. Mr. Delaney’s father was
one of a family of .28, but some of them died
in infancy. An aunt—wife of a tailor still
living, I think, in Parramatta —scored 21.
The runners-up in the Ashfield competition
aforesaid had only 12 on their card.
“T.R.H.” : The appointment of Barclay as
Governor of Pentridge will be welcomed by
prisoners, but not by warders. He is
absolutely fair, and will always listen to
what a prisoner has to say. When lie
went to the Melbourne gaol as Governor he
made a big change in the administration.
Clark, his predecessor, who committed sui-
cide, was too easy-going for his job, and the
warders did what they liked. Barclay
changed all that. He took to tramping
around at dead of night to see that the warders
were on duty. He examined the “tell-
tale clocks” to see if they had been faked,
and he mustered the prisoners himself once
a day. As Barclay has worked himself up
to his present position from that of ordinary
warder he knows all the little tricks that
warders can play on prisoners to get them
into trouble. I never heard a single prisoner
accuse him of injustice.
The mother of Victor Trumper died at
Chatswood (Sydney) last Saturday (Nov. 3).
She was 67. The world’s champion bats-
man had three sisters and two brothers, and
one of the sisters is also dead. The name
is being kept alive in the Gordon cricket
team by one of Victor’s nephews.
Pursuing the policy of pushing young men
ahead, Maoriland Government has lifted A.
I). Park from the Marine Dept, to he Assist-
ant Public Service Commissioner. He is 41,
has been in the service 23 years, and his
best work latterly has been the straightening
of the tangled accounts in the Agricultural
and Public Works Departments. Pai'k’s job
goes to G. 0. Godfrey. Assistant Under-Sec.
of Works, who is 43, and gained special
knowledge of the Service as sec. to W.
Ilall Jones, Minister of Public Works. He
served with the field-guns in France.
An oldest inhabitant died a few days ago
—William Ison, who came to Vic. as a young
man and for 71 years lived at Werribce, of
all places. Ison is said to have become a
citizen of the dreary place when only one
house was there beside the inevitable pub, and
he sold his first crop of hay at £35 a ton in
Bourke-street, Melbourne, at auction. More-
over he never missed an agricultural show in
Melbourne from the time of the first that
ever was.
The law and the profits sometimes meet,
but they don’t often stay together. The late
Chief Justice of Bananaland, Pope Cooper,
left only £2872.
R. I‘. Greville, Commissioner for Crown
Lands for North Auckland, who died recently,
was one of M.L.’s leading authorities on
kauri gum, and was sent to America to help
Uncle Sam regulate the market which handles
that commodity. As a youth he qualified
both as a lawyer and a surveyor, but he chose
the chain and theodolite to earn him Ms
crust. He leaves as a monument the best
surveys of the Forty-Mile Bush.
JOS. FRANCIS,
National M.H.R.
for Moreton (Q.).
“B lane”: It
must have been
catching. Harry
Murray’s batman, a
young fellow named
Rollings, wrote to
the much-decorated
Y.C. from hospi-
tal : “.. .. They’ve
had two tries
to set my leg; tlie bullet is still in my
side, and the shrapnel and splinters in my
arm and head are to be taken out soon.
Otherwise T am all right” And the
youngster didn’t mean to be humorous either.
The expulsion of “Jock” Garden and Howie
for refusing to sign a declaration that thev
had ceased to be members of the Communist
party, has automatically lifted W. Carbines
and H. Knight to the places the others leave
vacant on the A.L.P. executive in Sydney.
Carbines is an A.W.U. organiser, about whom
Bailey, M.L.A., had disagreeable remarks to
make recently. Knight is president of the
Western District of the Miners’ Federation.
The athlete doesn’t always crack up early.
Richard Timbs, who died at New Norfoik
(Tas.) the other day at 92, was a successful
oarsman at Hobart Towm regattas three-
quarters of a century ago. His widow is 97.
“Jacaranda” sounds the Last Post:—
Ex-Petty-Officer J. H. Shaw, whom the sea seems
to have claimed off the Bougainville coast in August,
packed plenty of adventure into his life. He was
many years in the Navy, and had the Persian Gulf
and the Italian Government’s Messina earthquake
medals in his kit. The Big- War saw him first with
Winston Churchill’s army at Antwerp, then with a
land force at Gallipoli. Back in the Navy, he was
on the Royal Sovereign in the Jutland scrap, got
an unusual distinction for a naval man in the shape
of a D.C.M. for laying range buoys on the Belgian
coast, and was handed the Royal Humane Society’s
trinket for rescuing a man at Scapa Plow. It was
while diving at 29 fathoms from the Rinaldo in the
range-buoy stunt that, owing to a sudden attack by
German destroyers, Shaw had to be jerked so sud-
denly on board that paralysis resulted and he was
invalided out of the Navy. Early in ’lB he came
to Australia as engineer of a frozen-meat ship which
he left at Sydney, and the climate so set him up that
in a few months he joined the A.I.F. The Armistice
intervening, he served a term with the Cocoanut
Lancers in the Mandated Territory, and later went
into a trading business with Lieut.-Commander Crook-
shank, who had found his war-time excitements on
submarines. Leaving their plantation and trading
station on the most southerly point, of Bougainville
in a 10-ton ketch to bring in copra from a notoriously
bad anchorage round the Western coast, Shaw and
his crew of six natives were caught by a bad storm
on August 6. Nothing has been heard or seen of
them since.
Banana!and lias lost H. D. Brennan, its
Commissioner of Taxes since 1919. He
was a native of the State and only 57. but
had been in bad health for some time, and a
visit to Melbourne for the income-tax con-
ference was the last straw.
“Nitric”: Here’s a nomination for the En-
durance Stakes. Old Bill Davidson drove the
six-in-liand from Surat (Q.) to Yeulba. a
distance of 49 miles, for 33 years, missing
but one week in that time. The distance
was completed once daily, although in
bad weather the black soil of those
parts would tax anything on wheels. The
present driver, who succeeded Old Bill, is
a mere tyro at the job, having been on the
road only 14 years. This Surat-Yeulba run,
by the way, has one or two spots known to
the old ’rangers—Dead Man’s Gully was the
scene of a hold-up, and at Postman’s Ridge
two mounted constables were cut off in
their prime.
BRUCE’S STRONG SUIT.
[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
“The Tailok and Cutter has been adversely
criticising Prime Minister Baldwin’s clothes and the
way he wears them. - ’
Come, Bruce, here’s one newspaper friend that’s
• assured, .
Though others may sneer at your aims
And the press labelled Cocoa deals out to you toko
For pushing tlie Commonwealth’s claims;
Though the Mail and the News have no time for the
views
That you hold and the faiths that you utter,
You’ll be voted, I’ll lay, A 1 and O.K.
By the mordant old Tailor and Cutter.
The pants of Lloyd George its derision provoke
As unworthi' a man of affairs;
Scorn, burning and! clamant, it heaps on the raiment
That Asquith habitually wears;
Things Winston has said have made some folk see
red,
And set many a critic a-splutter,
But the angriest notes have been penned on his
coats
By the scandalised Taiilor and Cutter.
Now Baldwin, we’re told, is the poorest of ads.
For his snip, and his studied neglect
Of elegant clothing is matter for loathing
’Mong those who the fashions affect.
The fit of his vest has precisians distressed,
His neckties make exquisites mutter
in tones of disgust and —he’s viewed with distrust,
In short, by the Tailor and Cutter.
So never you mind the press pepper, my lad,
In one office at least you may count
On praise as unstinted as ever was printed
And homage in any amount.
For the hue of your spats and the gloss of your
hats
I’ll bet they’ll have nothing- but butter,
Which means that, for guts, you’ll bang Massey and
Smuts
In the eyes of the Tailor and Cutter.

ABORIGINALITIES

BARNES LINSEED OIL
"F. Seedy" : A dinkum all-Australian
championship was fought recently near Mungindi
(N.S.W.). There were no cinema operators handy,
but they would give a bit to have it done once
more. Two boys (aged II and 9), out hunting
with two fox-terriers, bailed up a 6ft. “old man”
kangaroo under a tree with limbs spreading so low
that access was difficult. The boys got off their
horses and with sticks tried to whack the ’roo on
the head. When they found the old man was too
clever for this with the tree-branches to help him,
they tried strategy. One had a pocket-knife (their
only weapon), and he lashed it to a stick to make
a spear; but the ’roo’s defence was too good and
they could not get a thrust home. Then a brain
wave struck the elder boy. While his cobber had
tlie ’roo’s attention in front he climbed the tree and
with knife in hand dropped on to the animal. It was
a good go. Both dogs and the cobber with a stick
got to work, and the combination only just won.
The elder boy’s clothes were torn to rags, also his
hide; but after a. few stitches had been inserted he
was as perky as ever.
* * * *
“Dune”: He was imported, certainly, but
had the look of a farmer and talked farming as if
he knew all about it. I discovered, later, that he was
in the habit of reading the Agricultural columns
of the weekly papers. He had a fair sockful down
south, and was going to make a fortune showing us
poor cockies how to do things thoroughly. “No use
feeding a host of horses and cattle if you want to
make this game pay,” he told me. “You want a
strong tractor to pull your machinery and a decent
sort of motor-lorry to cart your stuff.” With this
I agreed. My one ambition, I told him, was to do
away with horses myself. “But what about cattle?”
I asked—“one must have a few milkers, you know.”
“No necessity,” said this ready-made agriculturist:
“I’ve just got quotes from various firms for some
rattling- good milking-machines.”
“0.H.A.”: It was Chiller’s turn for a
yarn, and he got this off: “I once saw some blokes
plantin’ stiffs in France. They was lyin’ all over
the place, so these coves sharpened the feet of
the poor blankards an’ drove ’em in with a maul.”
* * * *
“Bouragi”: Twenty years ago the official
bank-note rarely ventured above Cairns. In Cook-
town, John Clunn’s headquarters, his notes were the
principal currency, and across the straits in Samara!,
where John ran a pub and a big trading agency, his
notes and those of
“8.-P.” cut about SO-
SO. They were by no
means fragile creations,
but handsome affairs,
well printed on good
paper by a big Bris-
bane firm. Still, when
one remembers Papuan
conditions in those
days, there must have
been a tidy profit for
both firms from lost
and given-over cur-
rency. The coming of
several banks to the
Territory has almost
banished the old flim-
sies. Heavep knows,
they were quick enough
to take flight before
the banks came, for
that matter.

“Slushlight”: In
recent pars. about
sheep hanging on with-
out water no One
seems to have erfi-
phasised the fact that
the jumbucks started
the go-dry business
while the feed was
green. Sheep com-
mencing this way and
gradually getting used
to the feed drying
will live through the
summer even in the
hottest and driest parts
of Australia. That is,
providing only a few
are put in a paddock.
At the same time sheep
used to watering every
day will not last a
week if put in a dry
paddock, even though
the feed may be fairly good.

“Aneb”: “O. Archibald” (B. 18/10/’23)
asks, after seeing two yearling colts ridden, why
thoroughbreds will submit to man-handling without
a struggle while those of common clay put up a
strenuous fight. They won’t. The ordinary prad is
generally three or four years old when first tackled.
Leave a thoroughbred till then, and tackle him the
same way as 90 per cent, of others are “scruffed,”
and he’ll give “O. Archibald” all the fun he
wants. However, thoroughbreds are too costly to run
any risk with and are broken in properly. The
explanation of Archie’s disappointment at not seeing
a buckjumping exhibition is available in one word
—handling. The colts had been stabled a week, and
evidently, from his writing, had been properly
mouthed. The same method with the common horse-
flesh will give the same results, as a rule. The

curse of the average Australian liorsebreaker is his
ability to ride — i.e., stick. Outlaws are made by
man, not born, and not 10 per cent, of colts buck,
in the proper sense of the word, until taught to by
fright and the pinching of girths, crupper, etc., put
on before the time has arrived for them.

“Fana” : During a recent cyclone in N. S.
Wales, a large dam on Bogabigal station, near
Forbes, which was empty when the blow started, was
filled almost to its brim inside 12 hours. Half a
mile away from it was a body of flood water, which
had come down just previously, and the velocity of
the wind carried across the intervening distance
enough water to fill the tank. The ground between
dam and flood water was soaking when the cyclone
stopped, although it had been dry and parched just
before. Not a drop of rain fell in the whole of the
time.
•***'*
A three-armed coincidence :
“8.V.E.” (Goondiwindi, Q.): Tell “Paroo Peter”
(B. 4/10/’23) that we have on the premises here
a chook that crows, looks like a rooster and lays
five eggs a week. Also I broke an egg yesterday,
and besides the ordinary contents the shell contained
a perfectly-formed second egg in a hard shell —it
was about the size of a sparrow’s egg. Gan any of
the Council beat that ?
“Christopher” (Adaminaby, N.S.W.) : I’m entering
a. duck of mine for the record. This mormfig she
laid an ordinary-looking egg, but on breaking it
over the. pan I found inside another egg, shell and
all, about the size of a large pigeon’s egg. The
outer shell and the inner egg go with this par. as
a guarantee of good faith.
“Dune” (Rydal, N.S.W.): A while back a 'local
chook produced an outsize in eggs-—sin. through
from end to end and weighing 7joz. The owner
decided to “blow” it. She stabbed the end -with
a skewer and released the yolk and white, ahd on
looking into the cavity to see if. it was clean, saw
inside another egg, perfectly formed. On being
pierced with a skewer this also released a yolk and
white—in short, a fully-formed egg inside another
fully-formed egg.
* * * *
“Exul”: A couple of years ago two com-
plete skeletons of nototheria (extinct elephantine
niarsupials not unlike tapirs) were unearthed in the
Mowbray swamp, N.-W. Tas. Recently some bones of
another of these animals were discovered sft. below
the surface about 20yds. from the site of the origi-
nal discovery. They are splendidly preserved, and
consist of a lower jaw in two parts, each containing
four teeth, two 3in. tusks and two teeth from the
upper jaw. A search is to be made for the rest
of the bones, and archaeologists are pricking up
their ears over the affair.
In the matter of Petrol v. Bull:
“Barcoo”: It was rather impolite of “Jacky Roo”
(B. 4/10/’23) to call me a liar when I said that the
motor-lorry had come to stay in the wool-carrying
industry of Western Bananaland. As a matter of
cold fact, a list of stations, large and small, in the
Longreaeh, Hughenden, Richmond and Whiten dis-
tricts that have had their clips hauled into the rail-
head by lorry this season would about fill an Abo.
column. I am right up to the neck in wool for
nine months of the year and I have lately directed the
loading of several thousands of bales. The largest
metor-lorry in the carrying industry is owned by led
Francis, of Longreaeh, and cost £l6OO. Its owner,
when pushed to keep the wool away from the sheds
he hauls from, will roll eight tons on board and make
for the nearest railway at 15 miles an hour, and if
opportunity occurs five or six paying- passengers will
also be stacked on board en route. Francis’s fleet
of wool-carriers numbers two, but will soon be three
—the result of the profits he has made. Good luck
to him, anyhow, as the unfortunate foot-slogger upon
these interminable western downs is always invited
by him to hop up on top.
“X.Y.Z.”: Let me peel off and hop into “Jacky
Roo” on “Barcoo’s” side re the wool-carrying motor-
lorry. For a kick-off, the wot‘l railage here at
Long-reach averages about 1200 bales a week, four-
fifths of which are carted by motors c-f from one
to seven tons capacity. Old and tried teamsters
of 15 years on the black-soil plains have discarded
the whip, and now cover per hour what was pre-
viously a day’s stage —and wonder why they didn't
ALONE.

like to lend a dear friend ten bob?"

love it. But, alar s' I 'ain't got a friend

do it before. The problems of grass and water,
particularly in a dry time, are forgotten. Further,
this terminus railway-town, with a dozen coach
services covering a radius of 200 miles, and once
conspicious for its numerous seven-horse coaches, has
not now one solitary mail service drawn by horse-
flesh.

PLEASANT ROADS.
[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
On pleasant roads my feet are set
Where hope at every turn is met;
And good it is in days like these
To climb the hill and breast the breeze.
Such buds and blooms fair fields invest, ■
An ample yield is manifest.
Oh, land of laughter manifold,
Across your spaces fold on fold
of clover blue as tropic seas,
I walk through grass above the knees
That ripples up the slopes that rise
Until they kiss the cloudless skies.
Afar the waving- pastures sweep,
Full-flocked with shorn, contented sheep.
Out westward, where the ranges end
And whence the level plains extend,
A pile of granite- high upflung
Surmounts the crest of Calabung.
In regions magic, dim and strange,
Far in the east tall mountains range
From wooded slopes of amethyst
Through pearly seas of floating mist
That circle languidly below
Tall summits turreted with snow.
High is the stalk whose peeping ear
O’ertops a straw of yesteryear
Still standing bleached, of wealth long shorn,
A relic of the ripened com
That flourished in a field ablaze
When golden harvest filled the days.
Life laughs and sings since winter’s fled.
Old stubble snaps beneath the tread
Of patient teams which strain and toil,
Moving the ploughs that share the soil,
Turning again the fragrant sod
To seek the purging light of God.
Here sages scarred with toil are met
Whose peace w-as won with blinding sweat
In days when trackless wilds defied,
But failed to break their stubborn pride;
And though their youth is wholly spent
Theirs is the guerdon of content.
ON HIS HONOR.
THE PARSON : “And after the hunger of the 25,000 had been fully
appeased there were gathered up baskets-full sufficient to
feed many more, yea, even multitudes
THE SCEPTIC : “ Dinky-di, mister?"
Dense grass has hedged and overgrown
The rotting hide, the severed bone,
Where once the reeking carcase lay
And festered through the blazing day.
When thirsty famine’s fetid .breath
Was charged with pestilence and death.
Now every branch that waves on high,
Seeming to brush the peerless sky, _
Lends leafage to some vagrant bird
Whose mirth a cloudless day has stirred;
And gladly to the wayward breeze
He flings his careless rhapsodies.
Beside the tall and stately ranks
Of gums that fringe the Lachlan’s banks
Contented cattle drowse and dream
Of plenty by a swollen stream;
And man and beast from fear have rest,
For Spring is in the waking- west.

Preyed from Pureffu/tiHops' On fy
“FY7”: Everyone instructed in the art
—for it is an art —of breeding domestic animals
will endorse “Nymboida’s” defence (B. 25/10/’2S) of
the main principle of telegony—that a sire, especi-
ally in a first impregnation, will so emphasise his
characteristics that these will be transmitted to
future offspring. That principle is accepted by
practical men, as opposed to non-practical theorists,
the wide world over. If it were not we would see
nothing of the expensive means resorted to by stock-
breeders for isolating their pure-bred strains. To
“D.F.,” Dr. Cossart Ewart and their school a
union between a Durham bull and a Hereford cow
would mean just the one mongrel calf; but every
stockbreeder would know that that cow would be
liable, ever after, to transmit Durham characteristics,
however pure her subsequent Hereford mates
might be. We had a striking case in point some
years ago when Mrs. Duncan, a W. Queensland
owner of a famous Durham stud and herd, had her
cattle taken over by the Bananaland Government.
Carelessness and ignorance permitted the interference
of Government bulls of a different strain, with the
result that the reputation of the Duncan herd was
ruined —for some time, at any rate —and the incident
formed the, basis of a law suit that went to the
Privy Council.

across the widest part of the head. I carried the
old girl ihree miles to get her fitted for her coffin
—being 100 miles from the nearest “lick hole” we
naturally had not enough spirits to embalm her.
There is another in a jar in Connelly’s chemist-shop
in Dalby (Q.) which is said to have taped 3ft.
How do I know mine was not a gentleman? I
proved it by opening her and getting 19 eggs a
little larger than marbles. On second thoughts I’ll
also nominate her for the egg-laying competition.

“Larry Longun”: .Tacky buying a crupper
(B. 11/10/’23) recalls a newc-hum German employed
by mv paternal grandfather. Fritz was told off to
CIRCUMSTANTIAL EVIDENCE AT FAULT.

“Why, I kin see it on yer whiskers!”
“ Cam —that was larst Sunday, see!”
put down post-holes one day, and before starting
was sent to a neighbor for the loan of a crowbar.
Going down after a while to see how he was
getting on, grandad found Fritz standing at the edge
of a partly-dug post-hole wearing a bewildered look
and holding a crupper in his hand. “How,” he
was muttering to himself, “a man shall dig himself
holes out mit dis bletter tings I doan’ know.” Fritz
had asked for a “grupbar.”
“0.H.A.”: When Bill Brown sold his
’possum dog’ to Scott, lie guaranteed that the tyke
would clean out his land in less than a week. The
first night Scott, took the dog out it disappeared into
the bush, but did not bark. The next night the
same thing happened. Scott began to grow doubt-
ful, but decided to give the animal a last try. This

win you?”
time the dog, after being away some time, started
to bark furiously. Scott eventually found it under
two trees, both of them thick with ’possums. When
those from the first tree proved to be all blacks,
Scott wasn’t surprised when the other tree con-
tained nothing but greys. For a job of mustering
I don’t know anything better.
* * * »
“Nymboida”: I disagree with “Mac” (B.
27/9/’23) as to the cause of “coast disease.” To
begin with, the trouble is practically non-existent
in ringbarlced paddocks, kept free from undergrowth.
Ringbarking is not likely to render water less saline,
but it gives the grass the opportunity it never had
before of drawing on the lime phosphates and other
bone-nourishing elements of which the big coastal
forest trees formerly had a monopoly. Deep-rooted
grasses such as paspalum (a vigorous forager and lime
seeker) and clover (a gatherer of nitrogen from
the air) tend to en-
rich the blood and en-
able stock to withstand
disease. The lime-
deficiency" argument is
backed up by the fact
that coastal cattle run-
ning in the open forest
are inveterate bone-
chewers. Even cattle
from farther inland ac-
quire the habit when
depastured near the
sea; but they re-
linquish it when re-
turned to the ring-
barked areas. In a dry
season th e graziers of
the Clarence and other
northern N.S.W. rivers
use the coastal areas as
relief country, but sel-
dom allow’ their cattle
to graze in the bush
except in winter. Hun-
dreds have recently
gone there from the
burnt-out areas of the
Upper Clarence, but
chiefly to the ring-
barked paspalum pad-
docks. Usually cattle
are taken to the
coastal bush country
about May, but must
be removed not later
than the end of Sep-
tember. If any are
missed in the Spring
muster they generally
succumb to the dis-
ease, unless they hap-
pen to find their way
into cleared paddocks.
Even w'hen they have
been removed early, I
have known odd cattle,
if sharply turned by
drovers, to snap the
bones of both forelegs'.
* * *
“Gossi'e” : “Venturiuo’s” par. (B. 11/10/’2B)
emphasises the durability of dogs; but for down-
right refusal to give up the ghost and for recupera-
tive power I want to enter my cat. The other day
she was being chased by my two kangaroo-dogs and
a terrier when accident overtook her —or, rather,
she overtook it —in the shape of somebody’s cattle-
dog, which held on till the othei’s arrived. I am a
bit lame, and by the time I had cleaned things up
with a pick-handle the cat was to all appearance
dead. So I tipped her into the rubbish-box to await
decent cremation. When supper was over I was
rather startled to find pussy waiting as usual for
her evening meal, and after eating a big feed of
mutton she got into the store and had five kittens in
the tea chest. I consider tnstt>any cat which can
provide sport for four dogs, get ove? the indignity of
being cast into a dust-bin and/go and have a
healthy family of five in the tea /akes beating.
“Sirdar”: Tell “Ves Iv” (B. 11/10/’23)
that a pair of swallows builcb'two nests —one each
above two of my windows—regularly every year. The
young ones are hatched in one nest, but when they
become too large to be conveniently accommodated
in it, three of them are transferred to the second one.
Dad Swallow then commands one residence, while
Mum presides over the other.
* * * -#
“Jimmy Possum”: “Old Timer” will find
this a much more effective bait for a dingo than
his parrot dodge (B. 4/10/23). Take a lump of
suet about half the size of a man’s fist, drill a hole
into the centre of it with a stick or 'a pocket-
knife, put strychnine into the opening and seal with
a plug of suet. Then hold the bait over a fire by
means of a stick till well singed, and, without re-
moving it from the stick, drop it at a likely spot.
Warrigal can’t resist this dainty ; but to get him you
must be careful that the pill does not come in con-
tact with a human being'. Another good plan is to
bore a hole slightly out of the horizontal in the
sunny side of a post or stump, close to a cattle-
pad leading to water, the hole being plugged with
prepared dripping. The heat of the sun causes the
grease to trickle down the post, and even the most
cunning and cautious of dogs will have a lick at it
in passing. Those taking a taste are usually found
dead a short distance away.
“Warragul”: This beats “Yarrum’s” ti-
tree (B. 4/10/’23). Some time ago red-gum and
ironbark were extracted from a buried corduroy
road at Richmond (Vic.). The red-gum proved to
be excellently preserved, while on some logs of iron-
bark were actually portions of the bark. The oldest
native of Richmond—he is 80—has no recollection of
ever having >seen the road, which was apparently
laid down by convicts.
“Boori” : “Yarrum’s” galoot (B. 4/10/’23)
who cut down a ti-tree for “knees” for his boat '.s
a frequent cuss these days. It might interest him
to know that this is the specific use of that vege-
table ( Melaleuca leucadendron). Boatbuilders use
it in all high-class small craft for knees, stems
and chocks—Towns Bros, use nothing else. The
root and buttresses are the part used, the trunk
and limbs being too brittle. In durability and
beauty of g'rain and finish, no other Australian
timber can approach ti-tree for the purpose; except
perhaps cedar roots or white honeysuckle. .It is nor,
much fancied for other work, although it makes
serviceable decking, chiefly on account of its light-
ness and smooth wearing; but it must be well
secured against warping. Those ancient posts at
B/elmont may possibly belong to another local
paper-bark (M. styphelioides ), or prickly ti-tree,
once much used for fencing about Lake Macquarie
near the salt water. It is much more durable in
the ground and about the only timber the cobra-
worm leaves off the menu.
.** * *
“Numbugga”: “The Overlander” gives a
fine illustration (B. 4/10/’23) of what can be
done by a bushman who knows his horse. I knew
a young “ped” who left Adaminaby (N.S.W.) at
sunrise on a 14-hands Monaro brumby and had
his supper in Brga, 108 miles away, the same
night. This journey was repeated the following
year, on the same brumby, whose original sale price
was 25 bob, having been yarded on snowshoes after
a 3ft. fall of.. snow.
“Ringtail” ; I would recommend the Hay
(N.S.W.) b.umlary-rider who set hen’s eggs under
crows (B. 11/10/’23) to try a female kangaroo fe- -
ids next ineubatoi. In the early ’eighties we had
a pet female ’too cn the station, and the old argu-
ment started as to the birth of the hopper. To
prove whether the ’roo had any control over her
pouch the |)et. was caught and 12 quandong stones
were put in her nursery. The betting was even
money that she would take them out, but they
remained there for a week and she made no effort
to shift them; so we took them out and replaced
them with a hen’s egg (we would have put in a
dozen only we were afraid of the lady i breaking
them as she hopped about). At the end of three
weeks we took out a chicken and handed it over
to a broodv hen.
* * • •
“M’lian”: Powdered glass as a cure for
animal ophthalmia is not half as cruel as its use as
a stock vermifuge. Powdered tin is another remedy
of the same sort. Dogs especially are victims to
these two ghastly remedies. The theory is that the
powdered glass or tin cuts the worms and makes
them let go. It also cuts and penetrates the bowels
of the unfortunate patient. An odd one with green-
hide entrails recovers ; but usually the victim is
said to have been “too far gone with worms.” By
the way, mysterious deaths of straying stock are
often due to their having been “baited” with pow-
dered glass. Death comes gradually, preceded by
great emaciation and scouring, and never suggests
what might be called mechanical poisoning. An old
East Indian trick was to scrape the glassy surface
off a malacca cane and put it in the destined victim's
food. Death often took weeks to complete the job,
which kept suspicion away from the culprit.
* * * *
The Council goes to grass:—
“Azac”: There’s no need for “Splinter” (B.
11 /11)/’23) to fall out with his neighbors over the
question as to which grows the most grass—loo
acres of hilly country or 100 acres of flat* country.
If tne surface areas were exactly the same, so
would be the amounts of grass grown; but in
actual fact the 100 acres of hilly country would
hav e a considerably greater surface area on which to
grow grass than would the 100 acres of flat country.
Sa>', for sake of argument, you have an absolutely
flat area of 100 acres surveyed, and then build up
a few artificial hills in the middle of it. A rc-
survey will show that you still have only 100
acres, yet the surface area has been increased per-
haps I,] acre. The point is that a surveyor mea-
sures (horizontally) the lines bounding an area and
then computes the ar.ea—he has no instrument that
can measure the actual surface area enclosed by such
lines.
“Tarwin”: Tell “Splinter’’ that 100 acres of land
will, grow the same amount of grass irrespective of
hills or an}' other physical deformities. The argu-
ments up his way probably originated through the
local _ Solomons wrongly assuming that two paddocks,
one hilly and the other flat, having similar lineal
measurements, were of the same area. The hilly
paddock, of course, has the bigger acreage.
“Venturino”: Certainly the acreage of hilly coun-
try is greater than that shown on the map; but
as for growing more grass ? The same argument
crops up over the measuring of wind-driven rain.
One farmer with whom I boarded on Eyre Peninsula
(S.A.) -actually had a gauge that he could incline
at any angle to meet the rain squarely. Also, at
Langhorne’s Creek pub one night, an old piano-
tuner confided to a few of us that he had invented
a swinging gauge with a kind of tail plane, that
would keep the instrument tilted at the correct
angle. The Meteorological Bureau, he stated sadly,
was so old-fashioned that it refused to take up
his idea. I butted in like a blamed fool and got
myself disliked. They agreed that, with a perfectly
vertical rainfall, the top of the gauge would catch
the same amount of rain as an equal area of ground.
Further, that with a perfectly horizontal rain (if
sue h could be), the gauge and the ground would
SING, SWEET BIRD.
BILL : “Gripes, comrade, teas you born in the
Canary Isles?”
still catch equal quantities—that is, none at ail.
But though they agreed with these extremes, they
jibbed at the means, and the last remark I heard
about myself as I went to bed was: “Gosh! And
he’s a schoolteacher ! ”
“Biltong” : If every blade of grass grew vertically
and the horizontal distance between blades was
exactly the same, then as much grass would grow
on a flat as on a hill. It’s the loldl catch as to
whether there would be less fence posts needed
through the centre of a hill than over the top, the
answer being that there would be no difference.
To prove it, draw a 6in. straight line (to represent
the flat), then base a curve on the two extremities
(to represent the hill). Now mark off the straight
line in half-inches (to represent post-holes all.
say, 10ft. apart). Send straight lines at right
angles from these points right up through the curved
line. You will then have 13 posts 10ft. apart on
the flat and 13 posts 10ft. apart—horizontal measure-
ment as in actual fencing—over the hill. But on
our run at any rate, grass refuses to be dragooned
into growing in that regimental fashion.
CURLEWS.
[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
O’er the grey world conjured by her ghostly noon
Hangs the pallid splendor of the lifeless moon :
Dead, yet staring, open-eyed, spell-bound she lists
To the far sounds ebbing through the curd ing mists,
To the wild bird-voices, tremulous with pain,
Calling, calling on the One Tree Plain.
In the sterile vapor hanging like a breath
O’er a landscape ashen as the lips of Death,
Night and Silence listen. Not a pulse-beat stirs.
Then, across the stillness, a soft wing whirs
And the waste re-echoes. Hark! again, again—
Curlews calling on the One Tree Plain.

It was surely somebody on whose brain
the episode of the dropped garter and the
“Honi soit” motto has been etched who
named the new extension to the Crown-
street Women’s Hospital “The Prince of
Wales’s Wing.” Anyway, there it stands
four storeys high, and probably antiquarians
4000 years lienee will read the words graven
upon its foundation-stone and marvel afresh
over these Digger reputations! Acting-
Governor Cullen’s lady, looking very frail in
clinging black, and with General Finn in
attendance, presided first at the hospital’s
annual meeting in the Fullerton Memorial
Hall across the road, while women, babies,
and a few dozen men swarmej over the
intervening tramlines and pavefnents, and
presently unlocked the front portals of the
new building with a glittering gold key;
whereupon these same mothers, fathers and
infants surged up the steps and along the
polished corridors that lead to spick-and-span
offices and cheerful wards. There are six
new wards on each of the middle floors, and
each was opened by a different personage.
The Hon. Mrs. Pitt Rivers, in gaily-hued
close-fitting millinery and black frocking,
murmured a blessing over the one named
after herself, “Rachel Pitt Rivers” ; and P.
C. “Bunny” Shepherd made the hit of the
afternoon when he flung wide the N.S.W.
Police Band Nursery. Bunny, incidentally,
drinks nothing but milk, and his six feet-odd
of good nature is a fine recommendation for
the South Coast industry. The Pitts and
Margaret Harris, the Walter and Eliza Hall
Trust, G. Barnes and Seymour Shaw are
among those whose names shine in the hos-
pital archives for help in the good work:
they and others have reduced by 18 the
initial cost of 40 thousand pounds.
If you didn’t arrive at the Wentworth on
Hallowe’en with a sheet wrapped toga-wise
around you, or fashioned into a garment like
that worn by the friars of old, the man who
kept the door ushered you into a dimly-lit,
curtained recess, and in a more or less
sepulchral tone commanded you to don
your shroud. Having enveloped yourself
in this, and a mask like a turnip-liead on a
grinning Mephisto, you crawled down the
Palm Court steps, under the hollow eye-sock-
ets of all sorts of awesome figures that
consorted with broom-riding witches; then
you staggered into the ballroom, got en-
tangled in a Roger de Coverley and danced
in a dim twilight stabbed by flickering moths
of light. And there was a cauldron that
erupted witches armed with charms and
spells. But Sydney is too self-conscious to
fling itself wholly into such fooling. It wants
to play, but with a list of reservations as
long as the Shorter Catechism. At 10
o’clock the most potent charm of the evening
was worked under the magic wand of the
chef; a banqueting board sprang into being,
across the top of the ballroom, and around
it circled with great dignity in snowy rai-
ment a battalion of minor chefs who spread
forth huge platters on which food-structures
of glittersome and gaily-colored architecture
reared their terraces. A swan wearing a
water-lily in its tail poised gracefully at the
top of the feast, as though contemplating a
dignified passage down this Bay of Plenty.
In what is still referred to as Continental
fashion, although on the Continent it is
now almost as rare as a happy Russian, all
hands walked around the foods picking their
dishes; then, before tucking their knees
under the table-tops, the gathering offered up
three cheers for the chef!
Have your change ready for Poppy Day—
it’s to-morrow, Nov. 9.
Phyllis Martin married her man-on-the-
land, Roy McKeown, last Saturday after-
noon at her own old-fashioned home at
Merrylands. Phyllis is a vivid little gipsy
of a girl whose mother was the beautiful
Lorna Barton, of Wellington (N.S.W.) —-
mother still retains the beauty and a sort of;
radiance that makes her look like a
slightly-older sister of the bride. Battalion!:
of Bartons came down from the country to
cheer Phyllis, who wore ivory moire of early-
Victorian build. The knot was tied by bride-
groom’s father, who is that Padre McKeown
so beloved of W T averley; a sky-pilot brother
best-manned; and another brother, John of
the melodious voice, sang like an archangel.
Nellie King, a bright-eyed little lady who
has successfully organised many an R.C.
function, fluttered into matrimony the other
day at St. Cannace’s with J. M. Dodd, M.L.C.,
of Gundagai. The honey is being sipped in
mob-ridden Melbourne.
There was a storm of confetti in Mosman
when black-and-white artist Cecil Hartt was
married to popular “Biddy” Brewer. At
the altar of the Presbyterian kirk for a few
solemn minutes the bride was formally ad-
dressed as Iris; but she resumed the Biddy
just as soon as the solemnities were over. A
pretty, mischievous-eyed brunette, she is one
of the jolliest girls who ever helped an artist
to take a merry view of life. Her dog was
an honored guest at the breakfast, and after
she had held him up for the admiration of
the guests, his health had to be. proposed and
drunk. She and Cecil are having an unusual
honeymoon—a motor-side-car tong down the
South Coast, and through Gippsland to Mel-
bourne and the Cup revelry.
During the progress of a capital musical
programme provided by Mrs. Arthur
Scrivener at the Rawson Institute, an addi-
tional item was introduced —-the announce-
ment of the engagement of ’cellist Brenda
Deloitte to the Rev. J. N. Stephen, of
Longueville, both good friends of .Tack
ashore.
Sydney High School is one large grin : for
the first time in history it beat Sydney
Grammar at cricket on Saturday. Now it
turns to rowing, and to help equip it for
“the river” old-boy Laurence Godfrey Smith
has arranged a popular concert to be un-
loosed in the Conservatorium Hall next Mon-
day evening.
Jean Armstrong, who was the capable sec-
retary of a nurses’ home in Sydney before
post-war problems netted her for other parts,
is anchored at the moment in Shanghai as
social editress of the Ladies’ Companion—
“the only woman’s publication in the Far
East.” Most of the Australian women in
Shanghai are war nurses and “dinkum Aus-
sies.” The two big clubs for the sex are the
American and the British; at present both
are housed in rented buildings, but each is
striving for a roof-tree of its own. At Ye
Olde English Fayre held by the British
women the other week the exiles from _ the
South organised an Australian exhibit,
chiefly of foodstuffs, with a proud show of
bags and slippers and sucli-like fashioned
out of Australian leather.
Mrs. W. Moran, who used to be Millie
Hughes, unloosed a fine soprano in the Con-
servatorium last Thursday. It was the song-
bird’s first appearance on the stage since her
marriage, and a big audience of friends and
old admirers turned up to the recital. A
group of modern songs found the high lights
in the singer’s voice and temperament, and
met with bursts of applause that sounded
like a hailstorm of the first magnitude.
Mrs. M. Forrest, the Brisbane writing-
woman, has had good news from Cassell’s:
her latest novel, “The Wild Moth,” will be
published early in the Spring, and the royal-
ties offered have a sumptuous sound. An-
other novel from the same most versatile and
colorful pen, “The Scythe of Fate,” at pre-
sent running in the Brisbane Daily Mail, is
being considered by the publishers.
Say farewell to Dowell O’Reilly, one of
the foremost of Australian men of letters:
for Death caught up with him at Leura
early this
week, and lov-
able Dowell,
probably with
the whimsical
smile with
which he had
greeted what
Life had to
offer, faced the
last adventure
of all. Read-
ing Australia
recognised him
as one of her
elect from the
early days
when “Tears
and Triumphs”
c r y s tallised
into the per-
fect work of
art. Sin c e
then he has
p u blished
much, but never anything that was not a
gem of its kind. He was a regular task-
master to his wastepaper-basket. His gentle-
ness was something to marvel at; and the
diffidence with which he submitted his first
manuscript was never overcome. His offer-
ing was always “a little thing” that “might
interest you,” and probably that “little
thing” was seized upon by the editor as the
finest article or story he had met for months,
lie had friends and affection wherever sym-
pathy, culture and kindliness could win
them. Once, as a very young man, he sat
in the N.S.W. Parliament, and there moved
the first resolution in favor of woman suf-
frage. Later he was for years a master at
Sydney Grammar School. His published
works, besides “Tears and Triumphs,” in-
clude “Pedlar’s Pack,” “Australian Poems”
and “Five Corners.”
The E. J. Carrolls, father, mother and the
two boys, sailed for Europe on Hallowe’en.
Another for England-ho! is Phyl. MacArthur,
who goes to join her twin sister in Europe.
There was a large roll-up of Sydney smart-
setters to the dance given in her honor by
grass-widower Ernest Watt the other night.
Jackson, M.P., is responsible for this. In
a suburb of Alice Springs he was visiting a
cheerful settler who proudly displayed his
cottage upright. “What d’yer think of that for
a piano V” he demanded. "Looks good to
me." replied the politician. “Yes, it's all
right," drawled the owner. “Of course you
can't expect too much for seven quid. You
see, it’s this way. I bought that up in Dar-
win, and brought it down here —700 miles
—mostly by camel, and natch’ly y[t was a
bit shook up. The first night when 1 tried to
play it sounded horrible, and my mate told
me it needed refelting. So we ripped up
some old harness and got to work; but when
we had pasted on a few wads it sounded
worse than ever. So I tuned it—well, that’s
to say 1 made each note a bit higher than
the one before. Now it’s all right. What
about trying this song?—it came down with
a batch of the latest music from Darwin the
other day.” (The new song was “In the
Shade of the Old Apple-tree”!) Jackson,
M.P., started in with the owner playing the
accompaniment. Presently the _ musician
stopped. . “It’s no good, mister,” he said
pathetically, “we can't run together. I’ve
tried you on the white ones and I’ve tried
you on the black ones, but it sounds to me
as though you keep on running between the
tracks!”
If you're a town dweller you won’t know
who he is, but if your horizon stretches to
Oodnadatta or Port Hedland, then you “dip
your lid” to your pal in this picture. He's
Padre Flynn, the man with a vision as wide
as his native continent, and with an organis-
ing and constructive ability to match. His
is the big heart behind the Australian Inland
Mission, the man who in 11 years has caused
eight hospitals to spring up in the most
sparsely-peopled places of Australia. Until
the A.I.M. stretched its wing over them,
the boldest
pioneers of
Australia re-
mained with-
out the dim-
mest hope of
getting medical
help in their
hour of need.
Even now
some of them
are over 500
miles from a
hospital, and
that in a coun-
try where the
only transport
is by horse or
by camel
train. Every
nursing - home
may be taken
over by the
residents o f
the district it
serves; meantime the A.I.M. is behind them
all, backing their bills, and seeing things
through, rain or drought.
Now the man with his finger on the pulse
of out-back brother and sister has decided
that the time has come when the A.I.M.
must have a flying doctor; and even then
he won’t be happy till he has arranged for
big-centre specialists to do an occasional
round of the A.I.M. nursing-homes. “What
a chance for a city man to really know Aus-
tralia —its possibilities, its limitations! To
sec what the Back of Beyond suffers from the
fickleness of a rainfall that may be at flood-
tide this year and totally absent next!” The
Reverend John is the secretary of the
A.1.M., edits the Inlander, and is one of
the greatest authorities on Central Aus-
tralia and the Northern Territory. The
A.I.M. is a movement of the Presbyterian
Church; but really about all that the kirk
has to do with it is to find the money. The
photo is by May Moore.
Some discord over music has been created
among the Chosen by the appointment of
L. C. Mote as temporary choirmaster at the
Great Synagogue. The job was in the hands
of Arundel Orchard, and when he resigned,
on being made Director of the Conserva-
torium, it was decided to look for a man who
could be both choirmaster and teacher in
the Hebrew school. While the earth is be-
ing searched for one so qualified, Mote fills
the gap ; but, as there are several competent
Jewish musicians in Sydney, some of the
congregation are asking why one _of the
Goyim should be chosen for the job. It
hurts the vanity of many who are proud
of the musical flair of the race.
Mrs. Rosanna Mary Brees, who died the
other day at 87, was the widow of Harold
Brees, a Sydney draughtsman and water-
colorist of the ’seventies. One of the same
family was the first surveyor and artist em-
ployed by the Wakefields in the settlement
at Port Nicholson, now Wellington (M.L.).
Mrs. Barlee-Smith (she was comedian
Phil Smith’s first wife) is helping to keep
the home fires burning by running a dainty
bandbox of a shop in the Imperial Arcade.
On sale here are quaint, delicious trifles amid
colorful decorations from the brush of artist
Mary Edwards. “Ye Gaye Wee Slioppe is
the sign over the establishment, but in spite
of its old English name it suggests a bit
of Biarritz.
That talented and pretty acting lass, Mary
McGregor, who made such a hit as the flap-
per in "A Bill of Divorcement,” has been
promised the really big young-girl part in
Galsworthy’s “Skin Game” should that play,
as threatened, be produced in Australia. The
girleen read the part for producer Oscar
Asche the other day, and fired that Olym-
pian's enthusiasm.
Lift your glass to over 100 dyed-in-the-
wool business women who held their annual
dinner at the Allora the other night. They
were members of the Model Business College
Old Girls’ Union. Besides the pleasure the
old classmates get from keeping together, the
little club brings a night of fun each month
into the soldier huts at Randwick. The girls
may be just business women to unseeing
eyes, but in those Digger huts they are
brighter visions than the blessed damozel her-
self.
While Sid Smith was making the sketch
for his etching of “Ah Bum's Garden,”
shown at the Society of Artists, the owner
of the garden plot hovered around appa-
rently fascinated. "You sell ’em?” said
the Oriental. “No, 1 don't want to sell,”
said Sid. "I like; you sell ’em,” persisted
the. Adam of the Soil. “No, I want to keep
it,” said the artist. “You let me buy,”
cooed Ah Bum. “I pay you—l pay you one
shilling!”
There’s no saying what Australians may
come to when they settle in the Fog. Our
old friend Grace Watson is now a Councillor
of the Borough of Islington. In less strenu-
ous moments she maintains a genial outlook
on life from the Lyceum Club while the surg-
ing traffic of Piccadilly honks past.
A Brisbane postscript:—
His Ex., after presiding at the meeting of the
Bush Book Club, whereat he stressed the benefits
the Backblocks were getting from the association,
went with the McConnels, Dame Adelaide Anderson
and Capt. Hammond aboard the Moreton Bay at
New Farm wharf for the dance to aid the Common-
wealth officers’ nominee for the honor competition
in connection with a Children’s Hospital stunt. The
boat was all dressed up, two bands and a Hawaiian
orchestra played, and three decks echoed to the
dancing feet. The welcoming l hand was extended
the vice-regal party by CaJpt. Mason, Mrs. Tom
Ryan, the Brophys, ‘‘Princess’’ McTiernan (the com-
mittee’s candidate), and hon. sec. Denham.
Little Dame Adelaide Anderson, who has been for
24 years an inspector of factories in England, has
acted as clerk of a Royal Commission on Labor, has
contributed to the Encyclopedia Britannica, and
was an original Girton girl, is staying at Government
House. Accompanied by Capt. Harry Hammond, she
had a look through the Cotton Association’s premises
during the week, and later she went up to Nambour
to see how the sugar grows. She was off to China
on Guy Fawkes Day; thence she goes to India for
a holiday.
Mrs. and Miss McConnell have also been staying
at Government House, and Grade Deshon has com-
pleted her stay and fluttered back to Mitchell Downs.
Many swagger teas have happened as send-offs to
Mrs. Cadell Garrick and Mrs. Cecil Palmer, who are
heading eastwards on a holiday jaunt. Mrs. Whit-
tingham gave a luncheon at Lennons’ to Mrs. Gar-
rick and her girls, and the Lachlan Wilson and
Mcßryde dames gave a bridge evening at Montpelier,
in a pink color scheme, with Mrs. Palmer as guest
of honor.
At the Exhibition grounds a pageant-play, “The
Sign of Love,” was enacted by St. Margaret’s school
girls, with De Witt Batty leading the orchestra. It
was in the style of the old Miracle plays of the
days of John Donne, and 70 girls posed in it as
martyrs, missionaries, pilgrims, monks and nuns.
The Daily Mail licked Premier Theodore and his
Parliamentary team at the Brisbane Cricket Ground
the other day—it is more than 20 years since “Sir-
dar” Austin bowled the first ball in a Press v.
Parliament cricket match here. The editor of the
Daily Mail (C. E. Sligo, a Maorilander) bowled
Theodore after he had made nine runs. Between
whiles a ladies’ committee served the sort of drink
that, lives in a cup.
Mrs. Hawkes, one of the 15 (out of 200) guests
to survive when the earthquake wrecked the Grand
Hotel at Yokohama, arrived with her son on the
Arafura, and stayed with the Roy Matthewses en
route to Geelong.
Passed out on the last day of October, J. E.
Hilton, ex-mayor of South Brisbane. A widow and
two sons are left.
With the pleasant expectation of being “rather
shocked, you know,” Brisbane gathered to see Law-
rence Grossmith in “Quarantine” and continued to
gather all the week. On the opening night the big
audience included the Arthur Perrys, Hertzbergs,
Alan Jeffrays, Cecil O’Beirnes, Mcßrydes and Dar-
valls.
On the morning of the Ist, Tom Ryan’s widow-
filled the teapot at the Bellevue in Dame Adelaide
Anderson’s honor. Red gladioli and lilies cheered
the lounge, and on the tea-tables drowsy-headed
poppies, pink and red, nodded through the hot morn-
ing. Mrs. Ryan wore black marocain, while the
guest sported black and white French voile and a
black hat.
Among black cats and w) itches, ancient and
modern, a big crowd congregated for Hallowe’en.
Gloria Arundell did a spook dance, and the orchestra
was cheerfully robed in winding sheets; and every-
one seemed to enjoy herself.

Daily Mishaps Make
ZAM-BUK a Daily Need
A slip of the cutter—a nasty gash; in this and in scores of other
ways accidents that call for a quick, efficient healer occur to the busy
mother. Healthy youngsters romping in the garden or playground are
always “in the wars”; then on the farm or in the workshop a mishap
such as a painful sprain or a lacerated wound is liable to happen at any
moment. , .
For the prompt and intelligent treatment of all these and similar
superficial skin injuries always have handy a box of Zam-Buk, the ideal
first-aid. Zam-Buk is
Unecrualled for Cots, Bruises and Sores.
The stinging cut and smarting burn, the
crippling sore or other skin trouble, can be
treated in your own home safely, swiftly and
surely. For its wide range of utility, its sim-
plicity and ever-ready character, Zam-Buk is
aptly described “A Surgery in a Two-inch
Box.”
The action of Zam-Buk on the skin is
threefold —first, wherever there is pain or irri-
tation Zam-Buk is instantly cooling and sooth-
ing. Secondly, Zam-Buk purifies the tissues
and averts festering and blood-poison by kill-
ing all disease-germs. Finally, when it has
soothed and purified the injured place Zam-
Buk induces swift, perfect healing with new,
sound skin.
Zam-Buk is compact —always ready for
instant use, ever reliable; therefore a box
should be handy in every home.

A densely packed Derby crowd saw the
favorite go down on Saturday, but illness
spared King- Carnival’s popular owner,
Scobie Mackinnon, the heartrending sight,
and incidentally blue-pencilled his presence
Vr ~ e c bair a ' : the big Race dinner in the
Melbourne Club that evening. The dress
display was colorful rather than spectacular
-dress thrills must have been reserved for
the Cup. Half the feminine crowd was draped
m crepe de Chine, and a big section stuck
to tailorings. One slim figure achieved a dis-
tinctive note with what looked like a narrow
Oriental curtain and a couple of safety-pins,
borne of the most expensive frockers were
giddily hooped about with jazz patterns, while
others made it a welter with splashes of orange
or green. Despite the excessive sunshine few
women unfurled a brolly of anv description
they were content to take their chance under
hat dangles of lace or tulle. One ambi-
tiously dressed person topped off a sheeting
of orange silk with an overflowing fruit
basket on her head. Some of the newest
creations revealed every curve of the figure
beneath them—and not discreetly in some
cases.
Every seat was filled in the vice-regal
pen which boxes both gubernatorial houses.
Lady Forster was in blue silk inlaid with
embroideries, and had an ostrich plume
aloft, while the Countess Stradbroke was
blacked becomingly from truck to keelson.
Her Ex. Bridges, from S’Australia, was
banded in Oriental stripes under a brown
thatch. Lady Helena Rous’s crepe de Chine
looked like a nicely-baked biscuit, and she
had a feather curling over the brown bal-
cony of her crinoline hat. Lady Pat Black-
wood wore lilac crepe under a white hat.
Miss Hester Phillimore, who, for some un-
explained reason, has had her “Lady-in-
\Y aiting” title torn from her, suggested
quarantine or a new Chinese revolution in
violent yellow stripes. Mrs. Alfred Turn-
bull. of Sydney, came in the vice-regal
wake: also the Tasmanian Camerons.
A big leavening of the first social cream
was there, but got hopelessly mixed in with
the skimmed milk. Mrs. Norton was one of
the best-dressed in ficelle crepe inlaid with
silky lace that had a filmy cape effect and
was topped off with the smartest thing in
bine silk toques. Mrs. Alan Currie was a
symphony in biscuit crepe, and her sister.
Mrs. George Blackwood, sported a somewhat
similar frock. Dr. Barry Thompson, chort-
ling over a £lOO win, convoyed his other
half, who beamed in a rust-red frock and
cape.
His State Ex. and Lady Stradbroke are
going to dismantle the Stonington reception-
rooms for a brace of Spring season dances—
the first on Wednesday. Nov. 14. and the
second the following Friday night. It means
upsetting the whole house; but. then, the
State Government evidently didn’t expect
the King’s representative to entertain when
it plumped him down in a ballroomless sub-
urban villa.
.A richly-gilded widow lady has struck her
friends dumb—no, that is hardly the word —
by marrying her chauffeur. The latter pre-
sided at the wheel of the family buzz-cart
for umpteen years, and drove her late hus-
band’s first wife before her. The pair, as
soon as the deed was done, vanished on a
honeymoon overseas.
Mrs. Bob Staughton launched her one
ewe lamb, Millicent, as a grown-up at an
afternoon tea comfortably staged in her own
roomy Angelalla. All -the Very Best were
there, of course, and a skilfully adjusted
load of migrant vegetation provided a nice
backing for the tea and chatter. A careless
wealth of lilies-of-the-valley ton-dressing the
dining-room mahogany almost incited tea-
drinkers to daylight robbery. Mrs. Bob. be-
comingly browned in silk and lace under a
hat to match, welcomed the inrush, drawing
support from her daughter and deb.-to-be
cousin Joan Richmond. Millicent was in softly
shimmering lilac silk with red roses in the
centre of a lilac patch on her black hat, and
Joan fluttered in white crepe sprigged with
yellow beneath a hat that sprouted butter-
cups on the brim. There was a whole group
of sister buds convoyed by proud mothers—
among them Betty Mills, Mary Robertson
and a Kerang lass, Lorna McPhail. Mrs.
Arthur Little, from Syduey, blew in under
the wing of her aunt. Mrs. Neil Crowley,
with whom she is sheltering for the Clip
season. Leslie Jersey de Grut’s little
American wife, who landed here on the pre-
vious day with her husband, received her
baptism of Australian social fire at the party,
and she was good-looking enough to stand
up to it without flinching.
Speaker John Mackey and his household
are worshipping at the shrine of the boy babe
e Stork (who had not been sighted
at the family threshold for over nine years)
deposited at the homestead a few weeks back.
The breathless success of the Victoria
League ball will drop several hundreds into
the hat, and should put the frivol on the
calendar as a Derby eve fixture. All the
Very Aicest helped to crowd the St. txilda
lown Hall, and both vice-regal houses gave
social weight to the event. The committee
had lett no loophole for grumbles in any
sector, and it earned three cheers for refus-
ing to nibble into the profits for any spec-
tacular decorative effects. The room was
rendered sufficiently picturesque with red and
gold veilings, looped on the balcony frontages
with flower-filled baskets. Several Macedon
and Toorak gardens had been robbed to pro-
vide the roses which bloomed everywhere, and
an Lssendon matron, Mrs. Oliver, who is
tamed tor her flowers, was responsible for the
Lilliputian damask rose-trees potted on the
supper table.
Vice-royalty smiled from the far end of
the hall, which had been dressed up as a par-
lor. Lady Forster had green sequined em-
bellishments oil her black dress, and a green
foundation to her diamond coronet; the jazz-
ing Countess scintillated in bugled blue, with
a pointed back fall, while daughter Helena
danced in pink silk buttressed with gold lace,
lhe South Aus. Governor’s ladv cuddled into
a red silken shawl, over clinging folds of
marocain in the same shade. The Edward
Miller dame trailed stately brocades of rose-
pink enmeshed with gold, with ivory lace on
the top deck, and lion. sec. Edna Annytage’s
satin hangings suggested a bit of the Emerald
i-t' Mrs - Bertie Austin girdled her black
Chilton with gold, and the Best dame cur-
tained dove-grey silk with filmy lace on the
port side. The Mitchell, Mackey and Mauds-
ley dames were all in black, and’ Mrs. J
Alston was ficelled in lace. Little Mrs!
Cowper, just back from three years across
seas, aired the latest Paris creation in white
velvety georgette, and sister Laura Nyulasy
supported a second French importation in
delicate pink and crystal.
Malvern Anglican Grammar School has
acquired a new headmaster. He is A. J.
Marsden, an old Queenslander, a graduate of
Brisbane ’Varsity and one-time vice-warden
of St. John’s College in Brisbane. He is
still young enough to sometimes prefer a good
bat to a best book.
At a recent wedding at Coolac an enthusi-
astic well-wisher, in the absence of confetti,
aimed a shoe at the honeymoon couple. A
chemist had to be hurriedly requisitioned to
mend a cut cheek and take the color from a
black eye. Some husbands’ troubles begin
early.
This is Palma s rendering of Frances
McCall, whose complimentary concert
packed the Town Hall recently. She is an
Apple Island girl, and her soprano, which is
of long range and fine carrying power, is,
on the advice of Dolores and Dame Nellie
being seasoned for professional use. In 1910,
after Dolores
had put Fran-
ces through her
vocal paces, the
T a s m anians
inside and out-
side of the
McCall home
town, Devon-
port, hastened
to back the
famous sing-
ers’ fancy
with benefit
concerts, and
thereby raised
funds to send
the voice to
Melbourne. In
1920 the little
songbird was
installed as a
resident pupil
at the Metlio-
_ „ dist L a d i es’
College, and last year she entered on the full
course at the ’Varsity Con. The recent con-
cert was a Conservatorium move to help to
continue the talented girl’s studies.
“Corny of Tarrants” is married. At any
rate, invitations were out for the wedding in
Auckland when the mail left Maoriland.
He has taken a flat in Melbourne and will
settle here after the ’moon. The bride is a
Maorilander, and she has captured the most
indomitable jazzer of these parts—no dance
1( - v f<n Was complete without the towering form
ot _ Corny” topped by his impressive thatch
or iron-grey hair and his winning smile. And
he could outdance the heartiest flapper and
sfill work like a fiend in the daytime.
Corny recently roamed the Pacific, step-
ping from one island to another, on a prowl
tor oil. His bride probably knows whether
Ins name is Cornforth or Cornflower or Corn-
cure, but to social Melbourne he must always
be just “Corny of Tarrants.”
There was a full house when Brenda For-
dyce Wheeler sealed her matrimonial promise
to William Bates, the younger, at Toorak St.
John’s. She looked like a silvery moonbeam
in white georgette and lace encrusted with
silver and pearls. A filmy silk net weighted
with blossom floated from under a coronet
of orange flowers; and lilies-of-the-valley
walled in with lace were posied in one hand.
Her convoy of silver-shod maids —sister
Eleanor and Sylvia and Ethelwyn Bates—
were in turquoise crepe girdled with silver
beads, and had flowing veils anchored with
pinky wreaths. The bride’s schoolgirl cousin
Olva Bennett, in an abbreviated edition of
the attendant trio’s blue frocks, and with
her golden hair a-hanging down her back,
scattered roses along the bridal path. Olva’s
mother during the registry-signing interval
sang “My Prayer.” Maurice Bates looked
after cousin William, with minor assistance
from Bay liyland and Ken Wheeler, while
Jim Paxton, Max Shaw and Frank Ren-
nett buzzed round as ushers. The Wheelers
staged a bridal dinner at No. !) Darling-
street —she in tea-colored lace interwoven
with beads over georgette girdled with tor-
toise-shell and a bronze-shaded hat with lime
and mauve feathers on the brim. Mrs. W.
Bates was laced in bronze colorings circum-
ferenced with blue, and had sequins starring
the blue of her toque. The Robert Reid and
A. Thompson _ dames, grandmothers of the
contracting pair, smiled on the proceedings;
knights Hugh Denison and Arthur Robinson,
r ordyce Wheeler and Dan Taylor were
chiefly responsible for the oratorical out-
bursts, and Dorothy Murdoch’s contralto
added to the joy of the gathering.
Charles Austin’s beauteous other half,
sheathed in pale jade silk with green leaves
wreathing her hat, staged a dance tea at
Carlyon’s on Thursday for her fellow
Rockets, big and little, with a small rein-
forcement of pals, and, of course, silvery-
haired Hugh Ward. The thrill of the after-
noon was the Monte Carlo dance, in which
girls only were eligible for the prizes; but a
cabaret dance-and-song turn by Phyllis Amery
and a ballet of girl-boys made big hits. Dot
Rrunton smiled under a brown hat and over
biscuit-colored curtainings. Lorna Pounds
lightened her black dress with a chest em-
placement of _ white organdie, and Toots’s
Dionne attractiveness withstood the devastat-
ing shock of an almond-green hat-brim. Harry
i s e Wfe trotted in fluttery crepe
de Chine, and had barnyard plumage on her
black hat. Mrs. Hugh Ward was tailored
m black, and Mrs. Pounds buttressed her
bjnek with brown. Isabel Carlyon. lately
off the sick-list, did not bring her jazz slip-
pers, but smiled over the teacups in sand-
wiched Paisley and grey.
i r *,! iere an exhibition of butterflies,
beetles and other insects at Queen’s Hall,
Collins-street, and the ordinary unscientific
public is almost as excited as the entomolo-
gists are about it. The display of butter-
flies particularly is entrancing—every deli-
cate shade the milliner ever dreamed is
prisoned in this section. The major part of
the show is from Bananaland. F. P. Dodd
of Kuranda, brought down 15.000 specimens
—and this is not half of his little lot. The
exhibition will run for a couple of months,
and there will be many heated arguments
over the respective merits and demerits of
\ai ious insects. lor some poor little creepv
thing wdnfih is a pest in one country is a
deliverer m another; and that naturally
tends to confusion.
in £ yio°w and her sister-
m-law, Mrs. Iven Mackinnon, put on a fox-
trotting. affair at No. 9 Darling-street the
other night, for the former’s elder daughter,
H’ B 7 ho budclcrl some months back in
England. The danceroom was duly blos-
somed over with seasonable flowers, while
roses bloomed unrivalled among the jellies
and turkey. Mrs. Bostock lit up her black
lace with a red bouquet, while Mrs. Mac-
kinnon (she was the daughter of one-time
trench Consul de Jardin) radiated Frenohilv
over a mauve posy backed by a silver and lilac
frock, with crystal fringe trickling down her
arms. Mary Bostock fluffed in a full skirt
ot silver lace, and had roses wreathing her
head and bunched in her fingers. Her school-
sister Joan, temporarily “out” for the
glau occasion, trotted in pink silk, with roses
served up on the hem scallops. Lady Pat
black wood, the star guest, was chiffon-
velveted m rose red.
Ida Rentoul Outhwaite is picturesquely
papering the Decoration Gallerv walls with
her fames, plain and colored. Presumably
the lady has quarrelled with some of her
former loves, as the gay little elves and
brownies who gladdened her earlier fancies
are missing. In many of the black-and-white
drawings the fairies are spotlighted against
darkling backgrounds, more suggestive of the
haunts of demon kings than of Titania and
he i’ gossamer-winged folk. The artist does
not dabble m atmospheric effects and half-
tones. The colored pictures are more grace-
iully appealing by reason of their greater har-
mony, though the backgrounds are better
drawn than the rather lifeless fairies. The
etchings shown suggest a good deal of promise
in that medium. This is Ida Rentoul Outh-
waite s last Melbourne show before flitting to
the Fog with her husband and children for
an indefinite period.
Lord Loch was mentioned in the cables
the other day as a probable candidate for
Government House. He hasn’t made any
bones about his longing to come back to
Australia—he spent his impressionable
youth here, while his magnificently-bearded
dad was Governor of Victoria. But thereV
the question of money—he frankly can’t
afford to spend more than his_salary, and
has been told that he must. He is a tall,
laughing soldier—a “brig.” of the Grenadier
Guards—-and at home he has five children
to “place.” His wife is a daughter of the
Marquess of Northampton; and the Comp-
tons don’t belong to the new rich.
This ringlet-framed face belongs to Jean
Christie, the 13-ycar-old pianist of whom
the experts are expecting great things. Last
month, after a bare six months’ training
with Irene
Fletcher, fol-
lowing a lesser
term with a
student, sh e
gave a recital
of classical
works in tin*
Assembly
Hall, playing
entirely from
memory, and
doing it with
line tempera-
mental expres-
sion and an
amazing faeil-
it y which
spoke volumes
for her own
ability to
learn and
Irene Fletch-
er’s to in-
struct. Little
Jean's genius, which is a heritage from her
great-grandad, the late Sir David Brewster,
sprouted and flourished on a lonely farm
with nothing to nourish it beyond a
senile piano. She is the youngster, recently
noted, who shouldered the job of cleaning
the local State school to cover the cost of her
first musical lessons, and cheerfully trudged
many weary miles between the family farm
and her teacher's home.
The Hugh Ward pair beckoned the “Tons
oc Money” crowd, led by Dot Brunton, and
a group of petticoated Inky Wayfarers into
the Palace Theatre foyer on Friday after-
noon for a chat across tea-tables that glowed
with golden poppies under orange lights.
Everyone was cheerful, more especially blue-
6,\cd Dot, who twinkled in ivory marocain
and had a white roof with red and green
stripes. Mrs. Hugh Ward smiled in black
tailorings, and Emma Temple was blacked
in silk embroideries and had the spoils of
an ostrich-farm heaped upon her head. Mrs.
Charles Heslop sashed a cherry-colored glad-
ness into her dusky hangings, while Sylvia
Shaw sported petunia georgette under a grey
hat.
Some gossip from Adelaide:—
Gypsy, one of the popular Ernest Good twins,
decked herself in gold lace and gold tissue to go
ai:d say “I will” to Pat Colley in the Prospect
Parish Church. Her bridesmaids were sister Fay,
Florence Cox (Melbourne), and Esther and Nancy
Legoe two of them in almond green georgette and
the others in cream. Keith Angas, lan Hayward
and Tom Morris were ’groomsmen, and Dick Legoe
did the best-manning. It was a huge affair,: and
from the church the guests moved on to the Goods'
house at Prospect, where the doctor and his wife (she
in silver grey georgette) turned on meat and drink
in a marquee on the lawn.
The South Australian Orchestra scored another
success at its last concert, the Town Hall being
crowded to the last half-inch. After the audience
had kept Conductor Foote bowing and bowing at
the finish, he must have felt that when Providence
decided to build conductors it should have supplied
them with binged backs.
Ethel Campbell, the Durban girl, is having a busy
time here now. Returned Soldiers and representa-
tives of patriotic associations met her at the Mel-
bourne express; there was a reception at the Town
Hall, another in the evening with the Returned men
as hosts, a tea to meet soldiers’ and sailors’ relatives
at the Soldiers’ Club, luncheon at Government House,
pi ess interviews galore, speeches of welcome and
thanks from everyone from Mayors and Ministers
onwards, and between whiles a continuous stream
of visits from Billjim and his feminine belongings
anxious for a word with her.
We’ve other distinguished female visitors too —
Esther Anderson, who was here in the dim past as
sec. of the local Y.W.C.A., and Mary Dingman, one
of thp “world’s staff” of the same association. The
National Council of Women and other societies that
take a hand in women’s welfare work have been
their chief hostesses, and Mayor Colien said a word
of welcome to them at the Campbell reception.
The Marshall home at Mount Lofty, on e of the
show places of the hills, was put up for auction
during the week and passed in at £4300 ; so was
the John Gordons’ house on Brougham-place, though
that brought bids up to £7600. The latter place
was built by the Arthur Waterhouses, and sold by
them to the . Gordons, who are now moving to
the old home of the Charles Goodes, a door or two
away.

“ESSEX
n
Wins Pike’s-Peak Hill Climb.
Climbs 12 2-5 Miles to a Height of 14,109 ft. in
18min. 47 3"ssec.
This event stands alone as being by far the most severe trial for
this class of contest held in any part of the world, and the road, which
is over 12 miles long and averages only 20 feet wide, has more than
60 turns, many of which are of the hairpin variety.
The fifth annual Pikes-Peak Hill climb, held recently, was won by
Glen Schultz in an “ESSEX.” He ascended the hill in the remarkably
fast time of 18 minutes 47 3-5 seconds, only 23 seconds behind the
record time established by a “HUDSON” Super Six, and which has never
yet been broken.
This great “ESSEX” achievement is but further proof of the power,
speed and hill-climbing ability which, combined with low first and
maintenance costs, place the “ESSEX” in a class by itself, and account
for its ever-increasing popularity.

SURE CATCH TACKLE
The Victorian Derby may be said to have
put the lid on this season’s inconsistency of three-
year-old form. Any attempt to account for the easy
.ictory of Frances Tressady, in the record time of
2min. 33-4 sec., must be based on the theory that the
filly is a far better stayer than King Carnival and
Kahiri, who beat her in the Caulfield Guineas. The
failure of Shrapnel can be reasonably attributed to
his recent mishap. It was a day for fast times.
Turf and temperature were favorabie, and Black Scot
as well as King Carnival helped make the pace
merry. But when Frances Tressady had scored so
handsomely from Drongo the fact' stood out that
their previous record this season was unimpressive.
Each had scored a third, fifth and sixth in three
attempts up to Saturday. Frances Tressady, to be
sure, was talked of as brilliant, two months ago,
but as much was said of others that showed more
reason for the rumor. Perhaps the best possible
public excuse for backing the filly, who looked
“good class” as she left the birdcage*. for the course,
was given by a newspaper which published Derby
tips from a number of t ainers. It credited Norman
Godby with the prediction that the daughter of
Tressady would win Derby and Cup, and Godby is
a brainy expert. Moreover, it was a day for feminine
members of the rather untrustworthy family. Mitta,
a three-year-old half-sister of the subsequent. Derby
winner, opened the meeting by winning the Maiden
Plate.
Followers of form fared better in the Cantala
Stakes. At the finish of that race Claro, the Epsom
winner, seemed to be doing as he liked with Easing-
wold, who had scored two high-class w.f.a. wins
and a fine Caulfield Cup second in his three latest
performances. Sonora, winner of the Toorak Han-
dicap, finished third to the heavyweights. English
impo.tations have been up against Easingwold in
two Cantatas. Last year, when the Westralian was
eased out of a place at the finish, he had tried con-
clusions with unbeatable Violoncello in the straight.
Then the English nag won by four lengths. This
year the imported fellow gave the impression that
he might have made his half-length into a half-
dozen lengths had the jockey belted him out.
Maid of the Mist doesn’t always win, but she
makes her races interesting. In the Melbourne
Stakes she was out in front all the way round,
and only towards the finish did she succumb to the
determined on ush of Harvest King, who won the
Stakes last year unexpectedly. But the black horse
was no sooner proclaimed winner than Rivoli came
with a great run and beat him on the post. Among
the also-rans David shaped as he has often done on
the V.R.C. course, and Backwood responded to the
whip with a belated but harmless effort. To see his
undistressed condition after the race one might have
thought the handsome English horse capable of
great things, but the betting market indicated that
he was in no condition for Cup winning.
Judging by the murderous price offered, McShort-
odds was afraid of Flying Wynne falsifying train-
ing reports by getting away with the Maribyrnong
Plate. The touts proved true p ophets, however.
They assumed that a long stoppage in the flying
filly’s work, as the result of a mishap on the day of
her brilliant victory at V.R.C. October meeting,
had practically put her out of the Maribyrnong
running, and, though she started second favorite
to Heroic, Flying Wynne was never dangerous.
Heroic, Fujisan, Vei’sine and liaiwarra in that
order ran true to form, or thereabouts, whilst Flying
Wynne, on the outside of the course, ran only a little
better than Mercian King, of whom great things
were predicted a month earlier.
When the winner of the Hotham Handicap had to
carry a penalty in the Cup, the Hotham was chiefly
remarkable for a large and varied assortment of
dead meat. These times it throws out tips for the
two-miler. In Saturday’s race, improved King Ingoda,
first last vear, ran second to thrown-in EnglefieJd,
the Comedy King horse carrying 31 pounds more
than in 1922. Englefield immediately came into
prominence in the Cup betting, ai d punters wiio
swear by Scobie argued that since Bitalli, with only
Gst. 131 b. in the Cup, had been holding his own with
King Ingoda in their work, the October gelding
must surely win on Tuesday with 21b. less aboard
than the King carried last year. Unfortunately the
Hotham robbed the Heir Apparent party of a promis-
ing Cup chance. Although the bay finished third,
it was on three legs, and on Monday the pen had
to be put through his name.
* * * *
Bitalli won the. Cup from Rivoli (9st. lib.)
and Whittier’s brother Aqcarak (6st. 71b.). Like last
year’s winner he was trained by Scobie and ridden
by Wilson, and his victoiy administered another blow
to the impudent old fiction as to a gallop in public
being absolutely essential to the completion of a
horse’s preparation for the Cup. Scobie had as good
reason for letting Bitalli go “strange” to the scratch,
after three or four months’ absence from a race-
course, as Leslie MaeDoriaid had of old for sending
Revenue to the post for a Melbourne Cup—the
shortest-priced winner that ever was—when the
gelding had been kept dark for 12 months. Bitalli
is a five-year-old brown gelding by October (sire cf
Wirriway)—Miss Philina, and is owned by A. T.
Craig. He was xavorite at 4’s.
“0.K.” : Why this sustained confidence in
The Cypher—this eternal acceptance of a short
price about a horse that rarely wins, and then hap-
pens to do it at the wrong time? The money lost on
the heartbreaking son of Martian would long ago
have sufficed to break public belief in an ordinary
failure, but The Cypher, no matte" how he looks,
is always a good friend to the books. Coming out
for the Hotham Handicap on Saturday he seemed
anything but blooming, yet he was backed down
to 7 to 2 as though he were the good thing he is
always going to be, but never is. Take The Cypher’s
recent record. In the Herbert Power Stakes at
Caulfield he started first favorite with Easingwold,
and was beaten half a length. Three days later
lie went out first favorite for Caulfield Cup and ran
nowhere. A fortnight later he is sent for the
Hotham Handicap, first favorite again, and he runs
worse than ever. At the price one was offered about
him for big handicaps, or w.f.a. events, The Cypher
has been a ridiculously foolish investment.
“0.K.”: The Australian turf is very much
in need of a predominating stable, such as James
White kept going 40 years ago, one which would
set a standard for rival
stables. James While’s
favorite for the Deroy,
with Tom Hales aboaid,
was naturally presumed to
be about the pick of the
three-year-olds. The ques-
tion in considering the
chief classic or handicap
events was —-what, if any,
can be expected to beat
White’s best ? Punters
backed a crack from the
team of the N.S.W. owner,
as they backed one from
Donald Wallace’s smaller
lot of good ones, with
the certainty of getting a
fair run, and almost the
certainty of getting exeite-
THE PONIES.
VOICE FROM ABOVE (to milkman on Ms early
round) : “Is that the milkman? Did
you hear what won the first race?”
ment for their money. There was no “messing
about” with the good thinp-s that carried White's
light blue and white, or Dona'd Wallace’s magpie
jacket and red cap. You didn’t hear of their wanting
gallops in public to get them fit. They were not
always as brilliant as was -expected, but if they
failed there was never a long-drawn doubt as to
whether luck had been against them, or they hadn’t
been wound up. The period from 1880 to ’9O, which
had its heyday in, say, 1888, when Carbine, Lochiel
and Abercorn were all going strong, was a time for
swearing by good horses. In later years there has
been far too much reason for often swearing at them
for in-and-out performers, or mistrusting the intelli-
gence of their trainers, or the capability of their
riders.

“Verus”: A few days before Claro won
his Epsom Handicap a visitor to the laboratory
at the Mossman (N.Q.) mill spotted an old cigar-
box branded “Claro.” Being a punter, he said
“That looks like the Epsom ‘oil’ —whats in the
box?” The box contained Epsom salts.
“Tuart”: The modern 1 horse-reporter is a
dashing youth, but it seems quite easy to get Lie
loan of his leg. How else can one account for the
publication of such fantastic stories as “Wynette’s
victory in the Caulfield Cup took £250,000 out of
the Ring, ’ and “J. R. Corteen will collect £lOO,OOO
fiom the metailicians if Purser lands the Fleming-
ton two-miier.” Or for circumstantial statements co
the effect that this, that or the other professional
punter landed £„0,000, £40,000 or £50,000 on
such and such a race? Having seen a few professional
punters 1 reject the implication that they reveal
their secrets to horse-scribes on sensational sheets,
and thereby enable the income-tax commissioners to
extract a third or a half of their winnings, whatever
they may be. And knowing something of the latter-
day McShortodds, 1 refuse to believe that he takes
the risks attributed to him by paper-stainers who
swallow all the yarns he tells them. After E. A.
Connolly had cleaned up the Newmarket with Sun-
burst, he couldn’t get a price about Fleuriste for the
Doncaster and didn’t put a shilling on him. During the
recent A.J.C. round the only two horses backed lor
fairly big money were owned by gents, whom Mc-
Shortodds humorously regards as “mug owners” and
accommodates on tne principle that “if they win
to-day we’ll get it back, with compound interest, to-
morrow.” One of these amateurs landed a decent
stake not long ago, but most, if not all of it, has
returned to the bag. The other (he supported a
aud horse to win £25,000 at 20’s and 25's to 1) has
never been known to collect.
Ardglen (Bernard-Glen Iris) had made
such an exhibition of the cattle opnosed to him in
the Queensland Guineas that the bookmakers de-
manded odds on Saturday about his Q.T.C. Derbv
chance. He won pulling up from Pallene (second in
the Guineas) and Gay Song, but the time was dread-
fully slow —2min. 42 jsee. for the 12 furlongs. Old
Fairy Bob, who also claims Bernard as his sire, was
made favorite for the w.f.a. Spring Stakes, but had
to strike his colors to Prickles (Bobadil-Nettle), who
beat him by four lengths and ran the nine furlongs
in lmiri. 54sec. In a recent gallop on the track
Fairy Bob travelled rather better than Prickles;
nevertheless, there was a pot of money for the latter
at 4’s.
Ballymena, who beat a very tired lot of
youngsters ip the A.J.C. Derby, was unequal to get-
ting a place in the Maoriland classic. He failed
even to head his stable-companion, the very moderate
Murihaupo, who was third to Black Ronald and The
Polymnian. Black Ronald is by the
English sire Magpie, now at Scone
(N.S.W.), out of Maltee, a chestnut
mare by Malster—Last Lock, who was
raced about Sydney by J. C. Finn.
His time for the' 12 furlongs was
2min. 35 4-ssec.
* *
“0.K.”: A deep-laid French
design on the Cesarewitch and Cam-
bridgeshire double was upset by Ver-
dict’s defeat of Epinard in the shorter
race. Having won the Cesarewitch
with Rose Prince, the Frenchmen
reckoned the double as good as landed,
for Epinard they regarded as a cham-
pion ; moreover, the Cambridgeshire
is an event in which the French divi-
sion has always specialised. As long
ago as the days of Prince Charlie,
Peut-etre, a horse from France, took
the Cambridgeshire, and his party
afterward backed him against Prince
Charlie, but that long-legged flier (he
stood about 174 hands high) won
easily. The Frenchmen over-estimated
the sprinting powers of Peut-etre, but
they made few mistakes with other
good things they brought to Englai d
to win the last of the big Autumn
handicaps. Australia has a faint re-
miniscent interest in Lord Coventry,
owner of Verdict, the horse that spoilt .
the “double” from France. His .
Lordship is seemingly the old earl who was Master
of the Buckhounds in Queen Victoria’s time, and
whose son and heir, Lord Deerhurst, cut an ignoble
figure in Melbourne nearly 40 years ago, when he
prosecuted Bob Sievier for punching his nose <-n
account of a betting dispute. J. A. Panton, the boss
Tory magistrate of the period, sentenced Sievier ro
gaol on the ground that Lord Deerhurst was his Ex.’s
aide-de-camp, and therefore sacrosanct, but a higher
Court decided that the bookmaker should retain his
liberty.

All lotteries, as well as all betting except
bv a totalisator on a racecourse, are definitely un-
lawful in South Ans. ; and an Adelaide man lias
been fined for selling a shilling “art-union” ticket
for the Gayndah (Q.) Hospital Fund. He produced
a document purporting to be signed by the Queens-
land Attorney-General, saying that the scheme was
legal there; but the Adelaide P.M. thought it worth
25 bob, “as a warning to others.”
* * * *
On a top-dressed track, never built for
record-breaking, E. T. Goldsworthy, of the Kelvin
Harriers (Q.), beat J. Hodgkinson (Botany) and
other good Sydney sprinters in a 100yds. sprint
run half a second outside even time. Thereby he
acquired the N.S.W. championship over the distance.
The mile was a grim struggle between H. S.
Grandemange (Botany) and ,J. Hatton (East Sydney),
and Grandemange retained the honors in 4min. 43sec.
Others to take titles home were E. H. Scott (South
Sydney), 120yds. hurdles (16 2-ssec.) ; V. R. Har-
bison (Uni.), pole vault (10ft. lOin.) ; R. J. Honnor
(Botany), broad jump (22ft. 74m.) ; R. Norman
(East Sydney), 440yds. (53 4-ssec.) ; A. W. Reid
(Police), jave’in throw (152 ft. Bin.) ; W. F. Payne
(Police), • 161 b. shot putt (39ft. 74in.) : and Ernie
Austen (St. George), three-mile walk (22min.
49 2-ssee.). Austen is the only Olympic possibility
in that lot-

“Cell 14”: Re Melbourne ’Varsity’s quad-
ruple blue (B. l/11/’23). Sydney Uni. boasts two —
H. B. Rowlands and Jack Massie. Rowlands was
awarded the blazer for athletics, football, tennis and
rowing; Massie played cricket and football for the
’Varsitv and for N.S.W.. and earned blues for rowing
and athletics. The Melbourne man, Boynton, added
a blue for shooting to three blazers for major
sports. Sydney has only just agreed to award blues
for riflemen, and now that baseball, hockey and
swimming have been added to the list we should
begin to find all-rounders with a few feet of gold
lettering on their coats. Altogether 18 men have
been awarded triple blues by the Sydney Uni Sports
Union, two of them since the war, namely, Kenuall
(cricket, football and swimming) and Nothnng
(football, cricket and athletics).
“Centurion” : On Thursday the centenary
of Rugger was celebrated in Rugby School Close,
where Tom Brown and Tommy Brookes made their
bow as the first football herpes in literature. The
main event of the day was a match between
England-Wales and Seotland-Ireland sides, the first
combination winning by 21 points to 16. The Close
holds only 2000 people, and as tnere were 10,000
applications for tickets (they were restricted to
Rugbeians, past and present, and residents of Rugby
town), a good many had to stay on “the outer.’ -
To-day the game is played in practically every
country on earth. France, of the foreigners, has
made the biggest splash with 92 sub-unions affiliated
to the French R.U., including several in Algeria
and other French outlands. Spain formed a Rugoy
Union two years ago, and, with Soccer and tennis,
the old code' is cutting into bullfighting—so much so
that the Matadors’ Union has been protesting against
the irruption of brutal sports.
* * * *
“Schnorrer”: Surely the internationalisa-
tion of sport will make for world peace. One con-
jures up a picture of the war between the Yugo-
Blivvs and the Czecho-Blicks being postponed indefi-
nitely so as not to interrupt a competition in which
both are interested. In football, Australia has been
playing China, and hopes for a visit from a French team.
A Scottish Rugby XV has visited the Argentine ; and
the West Ham Soccer team has toured Europe. In
Vienna it was beaten by a Jewish side, the Hokoahs.
The Hokoahs visited London for a return match,
and were victorious again.
“J. 11.” (Lond.) : Tate, of Sussex, and
Macaulay and Roy Ivilner, of Yorkshire, are
the bowlers Macartney and Ryder will have
to watch when the English side goes to
Australia next year. Tate the critics regard
as another Barnes. Other rising cricketers
are A. E. R. Gilligan, the Sussex fast bowler, who
can also bat a bit; G. E. C. Wood, the ex-Cambridge
blue and the best wicket-keeper in England; M.
D. Lyon, another Cambridge player, a first-class bat
and very little inferior to Wood behind the sticks ;
and C. H. Taylor, the Westminster schoolboy who
made a flawless century for Oxford in the ’Varsity
match. If C. H. Gibson, whom A. C. Maclaren
looks upon as the best medium-naced bowler in Eng-
land, gets leave of absence from the Argentine, Aus-
tralia will find the 1924 English XI a very hard
nut to crack. And there is A. P. F. Chapman, but
some shrewd observers won’t have that long youth.
They maintain he can’t stand up to fast bowling.
“Centurion”: T. C. Lowry, the Maori-
leader, has been elected cricket captain of Cambridge
Uni., and, with Bettington, formerly of King’s
School (N.S.W.), leading Oxford, the ’Varsity match
at Lords next year should carry an Australasian
tang. Tne new Light Blue skipper was here with
Maclaren’s team last season; in his three innings in
Australia he averaged 13. A good bat of the hard-
hitting type and a first-class stumper, he did much
better on M.L. wickets, and is well thought of in
England, where he has played with the Gents. He
is the second Australasian to captain Cambridge,
his predecessor, Sammy Woods, having also cap-
tained the Cambridge and England R.U. XV’s in
the early ’nineties.
“Lightning”; “Great Elm” (B. 25/10/’23)
suppresses two essential facts in his vitriolic criti-
cism of South Australia’s attitude towards Queens
land’s claim to be included in the Sheffield Shield
competition. (1) The Victorian attitude was iden-
tical with that of S.A., and for the same reasons,
so that —any change having to be by unanimous con-
sent of the three States —even the wildest enthusiasm
for the project on S.A.’s part would not have got
the Queenslanders into the competition. (2) On the
invitation of S.A., Queensland and S.A. play in
Adelaide on December 26. But for its practical im-
possibility S.A. would welcome the widening of
the competition. Why not, if only that occasional
victory' would be sweeter than regular defeat? Any-
how, ithe charge of bad sportsmanship calls for with-
drawal.
# * * *
The second meeting of flyweights Mendies
and Swift at Sydney Stadium provided a sparkling
scrap. Trained to the minute on this occasion,
Mendies was the aggressor from beginning to end,
and in the fifth round he floored the Melbourne boy
with a wicked right. But Swift’s clever ducking
and back-moving earned him a hatful of points, and
many thought him entitled to the verdict, while
just as manyr favored Mendies on the score of his
offensive tactics and his harder punching. “A draw”
was Wallis’s just award.
* * * #
“Adelaide”: A big argument has possibly
been saved by the Murray Bridge boat getting
beaten at Melbourne (B. l/11/’23). The Returned
Soldiers’ Association, speaking through Col. Charlie
Butler, its president, has taken strong objection
to any' idea of Pfeiffer, the Murray Bridge stroke,
going to Europe as representing Australia ; this be-
cause in 1916 he expressed a conscientious objection
to fighting. His club replies warmly' that there is
nothing German about him except the name, and
that the rest of the crew—mostly returned soldiers—
have the highest regard for him, have unanimously
made him their captain, and wouldn’t go to Europe
without him if asked.
* * * #
“Lond.”: A back-yard mixture of fives and
tennis is being pushed in England. The ball is
hit against an upright board, but the implements
used are the same as in tennis. The advantage is
that practice can be obtained in about one-sixth of
the space required for the ordinary' game. Max
Woosnam, Mishu, the two Fyzees, and other experts
allow their names to be used in support. It is notori-
ously difficult to establish any new game, but this
seems to have a chance, particularly in the fine
hours of winter. In recognition of its joint origin,
it has been given the name of Five-Ten.
* * * *
“Cartot”: E. A. Brown, of Moore Park,
is the Ma State’s most persistent long-distance
walker. In 19 years he has traversed 5258 miles,
all within N. S. Wales, and the actual walking time
was 4296 hours. Brown, who pads the hoof solely
for pleasure, has twice travelled across the State,
once from north to south and once from east to
west. Being a methodical man he has kept an
account of his expenditure bn these jaunts; it amounts
so far to £lO5 16s. ll'd.
THE WINNER’S LAMENT.
[FOR THE BULLETIN. ]
1 ortune’s a jade, for scarce a sadder bloke
There lives than Bill, who picked the winning moke
In Derby, Cup, and other things as well—
Just how he did it Lord alone can tell!—*-
L ill’s luck was in whilst all his mates went broke.
We’d back our losers, and with dismal grin
We’d stand and see friend William’s monte win
(Some bloke had “told” him, or the silly cow
Had been and bumped against the tip somehow).
We’d studied form, and done our money in.
Bill was a Jonah till thi > turn he had
Of Chinese luck: yet now the blighter’s sad,
And on his dial wears a look so dour
It turns my milk of human kindness sour,
And makes a chap what’s lost his sugar mad.
“What cheer ?” said I to Bill, when, full of oof,
And holding of himself a bit aloof,
He hits the blooming bull’s-eye once again;
“Unless it pours,” says I, “you get no rain—
What cheer ?” And Bill, lie merely grunts “Gaw-
stroof !”
A decent loser in the past he’d been
Who done his brass in with a smile serene,
And never chewed the rag, but played the game,
As though all sorts of luck were all the same ;
Vet Bill’s the worst of winners ever seen.
A mocking song he heard the oof-bird sing
Of chances missed ; and ere the bird took wing
Bill wrung his hands, and voiced his vain regrets—
“Me ’eart’s .dead broke; won eight successive bets,
And never tried to bust the blanky Ring!”
VICTORIA.

THE INKY WAY.
“Hotide": A sign of the times is the strenuous
endeavor of the evening dailies to get something
besides sporting news. “Sport” got them circulated
all right; but the advertiser began to notice that
the mob which “does in all its dough” punting, and
only rushes the 'editions for the latest results, is not
the crowd that business advertisements appeal to.
Reproductions of all the pictures shown at the
Australian Art Exhibition in London —barring a
few of the Norman Lindsay water-colors —have
been put into a sumptuous volume issued by Art is
Australia. The edition is limited to 1000 numbered
copies. Sydney Ure Smith contributes a foreword on
the troubled genesis of the show, and Lionel Lindsay
a challenging appraisement of some of the leading
artiste.
“J.H.” (London) : Gilbert Murray’s latest service
to literature—a splendid rhyming translation of the
“Ohoephoraj (Libation Hearers) of .Eschylus”—
has just been published by Allen and Unwin. It
is doubtful if Oxford has ever had a greater Regius
Professor of Greek than Murray, and Australia
lias certainly never had a son more distinguished in his
own line. As Henry IV. Nevin Son says in the Daily
News. "he has made the noblest literature of the
world a new and living thing.”
“Haka”: “Jackv Roo” (B. 27/9/’23) says that
too often Australian editors are callous brutes, and
many a promising inky wayfarer has lost heart
througn their delaj- in returning rejected MS. Still, they
are returned. In 10 years 1 have never lost a MS.
on the Australian market, although one story took
four months to do the trip from Maoriland to Sydney
and back. The writer who loses heart over the be-
lated return of rejected screeds had better keep off
the American market. I should have a couple of
stories back any time now. They were posted to
Vankeeland in 1915.
“Wilfrido”: Does any other institution possess
such a fine show of soldiers’ magazines as the Turn-
hull Library (M.L.) ? Here are copies of 71 out of
87 known to have been issued on various transports,
going or returning, printed either on board or at
some port of call. Also there are copies of 30 that
were issued at different hospitals. The first of all
of them. The Pull-Thug, was published by the
advance party of the M.L. Expeditionary Force. It
ran to six numbers; it was the fate of most other
active-service journals to end at Volume 1, No. 1.
“Bison”: The par. about Vance Palmer’s daughter
(B. 27/9/’23) reminds me of Douglas Low, the
brother of The Bulletin’s former cartoonist. As
a nipper of nine Douglas perpetrated a novel of
about 30 chapters, and at the school he edited a
smao paper giving the day’s doings with a grave
decorum which seemed to promise a tremendous
future on the Argus. He had some of his brother’s
feeling for art, too, and I was shown a boat in
full sail across a half-yard of canvas which the
youngster had produced in oils. Douglas is now a
tall, well-built fellow of 15 or so, and his proud
dad tells me that he is beginning to draw very well.
“Adamascus”: 1 am on “Jacky Roo’s” side in this
dispute about the good and bad qualities of Australian
editors. At least 90 per cent, of the MSS. which arc
returned to me •from Australian papers are unfit for
further despatch. As regards courtesy, I plump for
American methods. Very often the' U.S.A. editors
will write you a letter explaining just what’s wrong-
with your stuff, whereas in Australia your copy is
too often returned weeks and weeks after submittal,
with a bare acknowledgment in an “Answers” column,
or no acknowledgment at all. Quite often I
have had MSS. returned from the U.S.A. and Eng-
!and when no stamp had been enclosed.
G. J. Nathan and 11. L. Mencken—about the only
two newspaper men in the U.S.A. who are at liberty’
to write exactly what they think —are leaving the
Smart Set at the end of this year. The only weak
feature of the Smart Set under their joyous regime
was its dreadful name. In January they will begin
editing, for Alfred A. Knopf, the American Mercury,
a job which should be entirely tio their taste. The
policy of the new monthly has an inspiring sound:
“First and last, its central effort will be to combat
all pedantry and pretence, to encourage sound and
original work in all intellectual departments, and
to offer a quick welcome and hearing to men and
women capable of it.”
“Hamer”: “T.R.H.’s” remarks about London edi-
tors (li/10/’23) conflict with my own impressions.
During less than a year’s experience with them, at
the close of my A.T.F. service, I found that not only
were they easy to interview, but frequently ’they
v anted to see the shy scribe who is in the habit,
like myself, of leaving copy and absconding before
it can be thrown after him. As for their courtesy
and considerateness—well, I intend to frame some
day this letter which accompanied a returned MS.: —
“The editor desires to express his sincere thanks
to ‘Hamer,’ Esq., for his courtesy in submitting the
accompanying manuscript, which he has read with
great interest. The fact that it is not considered
quite suitable for publication in this magazine is no
reflection upon its literary merit. The editor ex-
presses the hope that ‘Hamer,’ Esq., will be success-
ful in placing his manuscript, and will have the
greatest of pleasure in perusing any further contribu-
tions he may be good enough to submit.”
The fact that the form was printed and my name
filled into blank spaces rather spoilt its effect, of
course; but surely that editor meant well.
The appearance of Foreign Affairs, a high-class
quarterly, in the U.S.A. is highly significant; it is
a tacit admission that Uncle Sam simply cannot keep
aloof from the world and world polities. If there is
a. complaint to be lodged against the June issue,
just to hand through Angus and Robertson, it is
that most of the articles are written by ‘special
pleaders. An Italian patriot such ns Coppola is
not the man to discuss “Italy in the Mediterranean”
in a detached spirit; and though it might be hard
to find the equal of Georg Brandes (“Scandinavian
Destinies”) for knowledge of Scandinavia and tin-
gift of transmitting his sentiments into literature,
yet he fails to impress in the historical sense. The
place of honor is given to “The Running Sands,'
in which Edward M. House takes an optimistic
view of the League of Nations.
“Sturt”: Adelaide is having a long-distance libel
suit, with no end in sight. The last cadet camp's
management was criticised in the Herald, the Labor
daily, and General Leane as the head of the camp—
lie is also Commissioner of Police —brought an action
for criminal libel against editor Kneebone. The
proceedings in the Police Court were lengthy, but
in the end the P.M. merely found that there was a
case to pass on to the Criminal Court. So the
thing had to be gone all over again, and then the
jury disagreed. Judge Gordon’s summing up left it
very open, lie thought no niali.ee had been shown.
If the statements were true they must be taken as
fair comment and published for the public benefit.
But had they all been true? In particular, one
about the counting-out of an unpopular officer?
And the jury after four hours' thought said in legal
phraseology “Dunno.” Now the weariness lias
been laid out for a third airing.
“Cartot”: Queensland's late Chief Justice Pope
Cooper had a cool head, but he nearly lost it once
-—in the Brisbane Criminal Court 10 years or to
ago. In giving a notorious female abortionist 10
years’ hard, he said that one way of dealing with
this sort of crime was to legalise it : another was to
permit it in some contingencies; a third way, which
he naturally favored, was to make the penalty deter-
rently severe. A youthful reporter made it appear
next morning that Cooper believed in abortion, and
that he was advocating its legalisation, whereat even
Brisbane’s hardened population sat up. Then the
Chief had a few more remarks to make from the
Bench, and this time they were sulphurous. He
scarified the unfortunate youth, who was present, and
topped off with a series of reflections on papers which
employed boys on responsible work. The youngster
abandoned journalism soon after. IVhen I last saw
him he was driving a tram.

. “Bluebeard’s Eighth Wife” makes her last
appearance at Sydney Gri. to-morrow night.
Lawrence Grossmith follows in “Joseph En-
tangled” ; and an actor with so much savoir
faire can be relied upon to break free by less
heroic methods than his prototype had to
employ.
“A Southern Maid” continues to present
a riot of color and a revel of song at Her
Majesty’s, Sydney. Gladys Moncrieff has a
part that fits her like a snake’s skin, and
Claude Flemming is as likeable a scoundrel
as one might meet in a whole Cup-time.
The wizard, lavish hand of Oscar Asche is
everywhere apparent in the staging of the
piece.
At Sydney Theatre Royal the sad story of
what happened to the charming and patheti-
cally helpless “Iris,” after a rascally lawyer
had bolted with her money, is still being
unfolded in five acts. All the leading figures
are winning applause, and the boards are
bearing up bravely under the nightly impact
of 17 stone of distraught millionaire toppling
over like a shot rabbit.
There is nothing new to report about “The
O’Brien Girl” except that she is still witch-
ing Sydney Opera House patrons with mirth
and melody.
The Playbox Society is to burst upon
Sydney in St. James’s Hall on November 12
with “The Hairy Ape,” by Eugene O’Neill.
It will be the first production in Australia
of an O’Neill play, and settings on modern
lines have been designed by Donald Finley.
Duncan Macdougall, the producer, is a
native of Sydney who has had considerable
experience abroad. He once managed the
Barn Theatre in New York.

The Westminster Glee Singers packed
their notes and trills away and withdrew
from Sydney Town Hall during the week
after an Australian season that brought good
cheer to manager Chateau’s heart.
The flapper and her callow offsider are
alternately sniffling and guffawing at
“Paddy-the-Next-Best-Thing,” which is all
the rage at Sydney Lyceum. “Are
You a" Failure?” the other half of
the show, is a storm in a teacup
which badly stains the white tablecloth of
gentility. Bagmen and insipid counter-
jumpers alike will be inspired to doughty
deeds of commercial valor after an introduc-
tion to “The Go-Getter,” at the Strand,
where also “Marriage Morals” reveal that
orange blossoms are not always forerunners
of wedded bliss. “The Covered Waggon”
has collared popular interest at the Crystal
Palace. As “The Inferior Sex’s” represen-
tative at Hoyt’s, Mildred Chaplin has to
stand »a lot of rib-crushing embraces and
hand out forgiveness in the end. The man
\yho wears the halo at the Globe is accessory
to the slaughter of a parson, and unfortu-
nately for the audience his conscience con-
sents to a trashy repentance. The movie-
traffic cop has pushed “Robin Hood” along
to the Empress.
* * *
Though “Tons of Money,” at Melbourne
Palace, is meeting the fate of most wild
farces that reach this country with a Lon-
don reputation, ancient or modern, Charles
Heslop and Dorothy B run ton are not a
well-assorted pair for their leading parts.
There is insufficient contrast of style be-
tween the restlessness of Dorothy and the
jerky mannerisms of the young man from
London. The piece might have more inter-
est if Dorothy Brunton were presented as
her Australian self, instead of being put
forward as a Frenchwoman married to a
young thriftless English inventor and show-
ing him how to squander money. Nothing
French can be detected in Dorothy Brun-
ton’s head- or other dressing, nor in the
accent she has intensified since the first
night. For the rest of the tale of complica-
tions it may be said that where the plot
tries to be French it shrinks from completion
of its task. In a crude, simple way the situ-
ation is funny where Sylvia Shaw professes
to identify Dorothy Brunton’s husband as
her own lawful man from Mexico, and pro-
ceeds to lead him off to domestic bliss in the
teeth of Dorothy’s distraction. All the same
the situation stops short of the impropriety
that a blushing public secretly prays for.
The play has not the courage of its own giddi-
ness. It pauses on the brink of indiscretion.
“The Beggar’s Opera,” now limping to a
conclusion at Melbourne Majesty’s, will be
off the bill ere next Bulletin dawns, so the
harsh truth may be admitted that this
J.C.W. production has missed the ’bus. The
enclosing of the back section of the d.c.,
while the rest, of the house was left to its
original vastness, has not brought the quaint
old musical melodrama into closer sympathy
with modern taste. The effect was never
harmonious. And although Howett-Worster
was a melodious Macheath, the transposing
of airs written for a tenor is not a success
when it requires a silvery baritone to warble
’way down in his highwayman’s boots. Nor
is the foolishness of putting a nightgown on
Jack Cannot a pardonable liberty to take
with the libretto that Gay wrote. In short,
Melbourne can be forgiven its unsentimental
attitude towards this half-hearted treatment
of an antique. During next week Shaw’s
“Pygmalion” will be staged several times,
and on Saturday comes Emelie Polini in a
revival of “De Luxe Annie.”

At Melbourne Playhouse the nights of
Allan Wilkie’s Shakspeare season terminate
next Monday. That the indomitable Wilkie
has made a do, and a very good do, of it at
the little house by the Yarra-side is an upset
of pessimistic predictions and an encourage-
ment to Culchaw, who was badly in need of
a lift. The bill is to be changed every night
this week. Last Saturday it was “Mid-
summer Night’s Dream,” wherein a bare
apology for scenic effects, as the late George
Musgrove understood the term, is strength-
ened by the grace and freshness of the kid-
dies who dance Titania to sleep. The elves
are a delight, and Miss Kiore King’s per-
formance of Puck is conspicuously charming
in all respects. Oberon, on the other hand,
talks as though his immortal lines were a
lesson he feared to forget, and Miss Irene
Webb’s conception of Helena is much too
fraught with jauntiness. Nevertheless the
lady promises to profit by her present school-
ing in blank-verse delivery. Whether Allan
Wilkie is the best of Bottoms is a question
which may be withdrawn in favor of a vote
of appreciation of his force and talent in a
round of other characters, and as the man
who runs the Shakspearean concern so
capably.
At Melbourne King’s the management looks
lucky to be getting a month of boomsome
business out of a comedy so trifling as
“Belinda,” which will serve the Vanbrugh-
Boucicault turn until the 16th. “Belinda,”
very well suited to Repertory amateurs —the
story doesn’t admit of convincing perform-
ance, anyhow—-is not suited to the company
now dealing with it. Miss Vanbrugh lacks
the shallow charm of irresponsibility expected
of the name part; neither Boucicault nor
Pirie Bush carries persuasion as an adorer
of the “dear little thing” Miss Vanbrugh is
supposed to be; and the heavy man who plays
the long-lost husband of the lady is stodgy.
To be sure, stodginess is mostly naturalness;
humanity in general is sadly uninteresting.
Stage humanity, however, is expected to
stretch a point and be attractive in some way
or other. Whilst “Belinda” prospers ex-
ceedingly, people begin to speak of “The
Second Mrs. Tanqueray” as a thrill in store.
At Melbourne Royal the local and visiting
demand for “Sally” continues thrice as keen
as some better musical comedies have met
with in their long-forgotten careers. Popu-
larity has seemingly adopted little Josie Mel-
ville for her own cheeild.
“A SOUTHERN MAID,” AT SYDNEY
HER MAJESTY’S.
Walter Wew (Arthur Stigant ). proprietor

ming) on the free list .
“Rockets” ends a brief revival on Friday
this week, and then Melbourne will say good-
bye to the clever Pounds sistren; also to
Austin, the unctuous comedian whose humor
is on the lazy side; likewise to Wee Georgie
Harris, who stands to the Chosen Race in
the relationship of Peter Pan. “Rockets” at
the Princess’s is a somewhat enlarged repro-
duction of the costly revue it was at the
neighboring Palace a while ago, so Melbourne
can be cordially advised to jump at the last
chances of seeing the richest frivolous show
it is ever likely to get this side of futurity.
And then Allen Doone.
If Wirths’ Circus ever came to Melbourne
without claiming to be the Greatest Show
on Earth it is making up for the omission
this time. Were there more than one earth
the circus that Wirths provide would still
be the greatest, and on a crowded Saturday
night the bold assertion seems to defy con-
tradiction. This being Cup Week the win-
ning jockey was due to be presented with a
whip. As regards local rioting, incited by
a disaffected section of the police force’that
had become demoralised by Squizzy Taylor,
the menagerie at large made noises indica-
tive of its desire to be let loose among the
rioters with a view to restoring law and
order. Two educated elephants would have
been enough.
The preposterous energy of an American
drummer is stirring the multitude at Hoyt’s,
Melbourne, this week. He is proudly en-
titled “The Go-Getter,” and his burlesque
activity is accepted as an unconscious satire
on the Yankee spirit in business. “What
Wives Want,” at Hoyt’s Gaiety, is another
sermon on preoccupied husbands and their
neglected belongings. The text begins to wear
a frayed look. The Majestic screens a
middle-aged frolic with familiar trimmings
in “Has the World Gone Mad?” while a case
of impersonation, with an English johnny as
the victim, frequently holds the attention in
“The Fighting Guide.” Betty Balfour is a
more beautiful sweetheart than Wee Mac-
gregor deserves, but Britannia supporters find
something droll and affecting in the J. J.
Bell creation. And at the Melba Thomas
Meighan is doing the latest Rex Beach story,
“The Ne’er Do Well.”
Two variety shows in Melbourne: —
An exhibition of oils and water-colors at the
Fine Art Society’s Gallery is interesting for the
reappearance of two pictures by the late Hugh
Ramsay. The larger canvas, a harrowing garret
tableau, just failed to win the artist a Travelling
Scholarship. The other is a perturbing vision of
gloom that keeps the short-sighted peering fir
details —just a feminine profile and clasped hands
are dimly visible in a mass of sombre pigment.
George Lambert sends a glowering landscape con-
taining a horse that looks like the model for an
equestrian statue. Normatt Lindsay continues his
explorations among the Great Undressed, and dainty
figures pose in silhouette in one of Blamire Young’s
unreal impressions. A pale" greenscape by J. •!.
Hilder, which is about six inches square, is marked
90- guineas, and andther duller subject, about the
same size, is priced at 105 guineas by its present
owner. C. Hampel’s spacious view of the Yarra
flats at Kew is the one bit of Nature in the exhi-
bition. B. E. Minns does fairly well in Sydneyside
sketches, and James R. Jackson is agreeably plain
and unemphatic in his picture of “The Quarry.
Hans Heysen is the author of two still-lifes which
are brilliantly painted, though the challenging sharp-
ness of the brushwork is an insincere demonstration
of technique. One of M. J. MacNally’s patented
sallow afternoons is labelled “Evening Glow” ; he
also contributes a “Toolshed” which is hardly more
than a pictorial post-mortem. Harold B. Herbert
grows greyer and more delicate J his latest set of
water-colors from England may be regarded as a
complete expiation for his somewhat lurid past.
Leila Bothroyd is commendable for a couple of street
studies in flat tones ; A. B. Webb’s decorative water-
colors are pleasing; but one finds small merit in
John D. Moore’s loud catalogue of suburban roofs,
apologetically entitled “Chaos.” Some pictures, like
some actors, ought to be seen and not heard.
Another sw r arm of drawings in black-and-white and
color by Ida Rentoul Outhwaite at the Decoration
Gallery suggests that she has reached her limit
as a decorative illustrator. Admittedly she handles
her materials gracefully, but her efforts are often
stodgy variations of one or two safe and settled
plans of design. Here and there a drawing stands
out as a feat of penmanship, but, through the meagre*
ness of the imaginative faculty, still fails to swing
one definitely round in its favor. The main weak-
ness is in the color section, Wherein the artist
displays a singular faith in pale washes of pink and
blue. Also her children and fairies are never be-
witching. They all move primly on wooden legs,
their hair apparently crinkled and fussed up for
a birthdav party at one of the Best Houses.
** * *
Adelaide Repertory Theatre, which has
tackled most ot Ibsen in its time, has now
given two performances of the gloomy “John
Gabriel Borkman.” Wilfred Neill produced,
and also played the name-part. His J.G.B.
was a truly gloomy Scandinavian, bilt
less violent than Bryant made him when
Gregan MacMahon produced it. Ethelwyn
Robin was the unforgiving wife, a big
change from her usual epigram-slinging
Society matrons; and Kitty Sullivan, who
seems able to play anything, was the other
woman who fights for John Gabriel’s soul
and body. The smaller parts were capably
filled, but nearly all the work falls on these
three. The Rep. has possibly never done
anything better.
* # *
“The Flaw,” as seen at Adelaide Royal,
proves to be unexpectedly good. It is a
great idea to kill the villain early and keep
the detective guessing merely which of the
“good” characters got him. Two details
might be improved. One is the absurd be-
lief that shooting a midnight burglar is a
hanging matter. The other is the big scene
between husband and wife—“third degree” as
she justly calls it. This is distinctly too long
for an extreme-tension scene, and gets an
unwelcome laugh when it keeps on starting
again after it seemed over. But the play
gives Emelie Polini a fine vehicle for the
display of various kinds of almost unrelieved
gloom; Frank Harvey and the rest support

Moses Baritz on opera by wireless :
Since my fast letter to The Bulletin I have
been engaged in broadcasting opera. I began at
Manchester on May 6 with “Madame Butterfly,” the
first opera broadcasted in the British Isles. After
“Butterfly” we gave a Verdi-Wagner-Mozart-Rossini
night; then came “Tannhauser,” “Barber of
Seville” “11 Trovatore” and “Carmen.” Other
operas to be done are “Lohefigrin,” the “Valkyrie,”
“Faust,” “Rigoletto,” “Flying Dutchman,” “Don
Giovanni” and a thing not yet translated into Eng-
lish, Mozart’s “Idomeneo.” I am translating it my-
self and it will he given from the Manchester sta-
tion in May. The transmission of “Faust,” at
Birmingham, was a record, in that it was the first
time a chorus was used for an operatic performance
at a station. There is a large local operatic chorus
from which the principals are selected.
“Norbell”: “Cymbeline,” mentioned by
“J.F.H.” (B. 25/10/’23), is soon to be done
by Allan Wilkie. Frediswyde Hunter-Watts
should be well in the picture as Imogen.
Louise Pomeroy played the part at Sydney
Royal in Feb., ’B2, supported by the late
Stirling Whyte. Five or six years later Essie
Jehyns appeared in the character at the Cri-
terion, and I have a painful recollection of
Bill Holloway’s fruity bellow. He was
Imogen’s husband, but looked more like her
stepfather—as he was, in fact.
“0.K.”: A “Beggar’s Opera” ballad sets
one thinking of "David Copperfield.” In
chapter 24 David gave the famous dinner
for which he bought a slab of mock turtle
that ought to have sufficed for 15 people,
though it shrunk so much in Mrs. Crupp’s
kitchen that “we found it what Steerforth
called ‘rather a tight fit’ for four.” Now, of
the two friends that Steerforth brought to
David Copperfield’s dinner-party one was a
young fellow named Markham, who “always
spoke of himself indefinitely as ‘a man’ and
seldom or never in the first person singular.”
The banquet proceeded until David, being
pretty drunk, was surprised to find that
“somebody was in the middle of a song.
Markham was the singer, and he sang ‘lf
the Heart of a Man is Oppressed with
Cares.’ ” It is sung by Macheath in the
tavern near Newgate, and of all the "Beg-
gar’s Opera” ditties it was the best-known in
Dickens’s day, though “How Happy Could I
be with Either” is, of course, the classic
that cannot age.
“Abbot Park” : In the list of operas to be
sung by Melba’s latest aviary only two new
works —“Andre Chenier” and “The Pearl
Fishers” —are mentioned. Any opera, I
suppose, is better than none, but the public
would cheerfully do without “Trovatore” and
“Lucia” if it could have Massenet’s “Manon”
and “Thais,” Goldmark’s “The Queen of
Sheba,” and a representative work by one
of the later Russian composers. W. S. Lyster
took an honest pride in keeping Australia
in touch with modern productions. He
brought “Carmen” to Melbourne four years
after Paris had first seen it. “Faust” he did
five years after its European premiere;
“Aida” six years after.
“T. 0.1.”: Frank Smith, promoter of
Botany handicaps and minstrel shows (B.
25/10/’23), was a son-in-law of old Larry
Byrne, landlord of the Golden Fleece, on
the corner of Castlereagh and Campbell
streets. Frank himself kept the Burrangong
Hotel, on the corner of Hay and George
streets ; but the widening of Hay-street wiped
out that old stand. At that time the Odd-
fellows’ Hall assembly rooms were in
Sussex-street, and Frank was a member of a
dramatic company which performed there.
That was the door by which he came on to
Poverty Point.
“Riverina”: “T.0.1.’5” mention (B.
27/9/’23) of Fanny Cathcart, afterwards
Mrs. George Darrell, reminds that her first
husband, Robert James Heir, died at sea
off the M.L. coast while on a tour of the
Tremulous Isles in 1868. His remains were
interred at Bluff, and part of the kauri
monument still stands. A metal plate
attached shows he was only 36 at the call.
Old-timers speak of him as a public idol.
Visiting Poverty Pointers occasionally climb
to the picturesque cemetery and place
wreaths on his last curtain.
“Elingarah”: Joseph Bland Holt’s signa-
ture is a work of art, and looks like “This
Indenture” at the head of a legal document,
lie writes it with a long, flexible steel pen
which he carries in his vest pocket, making
the flourishes first and then filling in his
name. When he was a young man these affec-
tations lost him a lucrative engagement, his
application to a London manager having
been returned with “Don’t like your signa-
ture” written across the corner. In later
years the same manager was glad to get the
same “loud” hieroglyph on a contract.
“Zeus”: For how long are we to suffer
the line-up of performers after every scene
in our theatres, and the consequent violent
severance of the thread of the plot? The
absurdity has almost become a thing of the
past in England, but Australia clings to
it. religiously. After death scenes, as where
Bulldog Drummond strangles the monster
Lakington, it is a most unpleasant jar to
behold the deceased smiling and bowing as if
nothing untoward had occurred. The players
say the public demands this nonsense, while
the public asserts that it is for the benefit
of the performers. It seems more likely
that it is distasteful to all parties.
“J.H.” (London) : “Our Betters,” Somerset
Maugham’s “warm” satire at the Globe, is
praised for its wit, but is unlikely to last
long. It depicts wholly impossible people
and is badly cast. Although the critics have
tided to be kind to Margaret Bannerman,
making her first essay in straight comedy,
she is' essentially a revue actress, of the
Delysia type, and will never be a serious rival
to Madge Titheradge, Edith Evans or the
Vanbrughs. The most successful shows in
London at the moment are “Brighter Lon-
don,” the Hippodrome revue, with Billy Mer-
son and Lupino Lane; “Stop Flirting,”
which depends mainly on the Astaires
(brother and sister), from Amurrika; “So
This Is London,” a farce at the Prince of
Wales’s; and “The Lilies of the Field,” Hast-
ings Turner’s comedy at the Ambassador’s.
Meggie Alban esi and Edna Best share the
lead in “The Lilies,” which is a brilliant
thing.
SUBSTITUTE.
“Would you mind posing, dear, in the middle
distance? I was going to paint a cow
in, hut you’ll do just as well.”
“M.P.A.” (New York) : Basil Macdonald,
quoted by “Frinigga” (B. 12/7/’23), de-
scribes Laurette Taylor as the greatest
actress in America, if not in the world. I
saw Laurette as “Sweet Nell of Old Drury”
from the front, and on several occasions from
the o.p. side. Her performance never got
within a street of Nellie Stewart’s handling
of the part. In her scene with Charles at
the spinet her voice was toneless, and the
accompaniment was obviously faked off-stage.
For this Miss Stewart never failed to pull an
encore; Laurette could not even get a hand.
I have seen a dozen actresses I would place
before Laurette Taylor.
“Old-Timer,” from Manhattan (U.S.A.) :
Tell “Amor Pat” (B. 14/6/’23) I never said that
Leon Caron composed and conducted the cantata
which opened the Melbourne Centennial Exhibition
of 1888. I stated that Caron composed and con-
ducted the cantata “Victoria,” which opened the
1880 Exhibition. As to the baton alleged to have
been presented to Caron in a commiserating spirit
after the 1888 affair, there is no such bauble in the
Caron collection, which contains gold-mounted sticks
from, among others, William Paul (who, having lost
his voice, hurled himself from the window of a
New York hotel), Wilson Barrett and Camille Urso,
and numerous ivory and silver batons, the most
handsome being the one subscribed for by the 1880
Exhibition choir. “Amor Pat” might have men-
tioned that the late Rev. Henry Allen wrote the
ode for the opening of the 1888 Exhibition. He was
then pastor of the Congregational Church, Carlton
(Vic.). Later he migrated to Sydney.
FIFTY-FIFTY.
THE CURATE : “The worst of preaching is
that the congregation cannot applaud,
you know.”
THE CHORUS : “But, then, they can’t give you
the bird either.”
“Hamfat”: Annie Hughes, who besides
being Fanny Sylvain in “Iris” has bad a
starring part in Sydney Divorce Court, with
Mayne Linton as heavy villain, appeared in
“The Private Secretary” at 16, succeeding
Maude Millett in the role of Eva Webster.
Later she was with the Kendals and Irving.
Another member of Irving’s eo. was Julius
Knight, who had a dispute with the great
man over the pronunciation of some French.
“Dammit, man,” thundered Irving, “you
can’t speak French!” Knight retorted hotly
that if the chief wasn’t satisfied he would
leave for Australia. Leave he did. Miss
Hughes was the original Nora Brewster in
“A Story of Waterloo,” done by Knight as
a curtain-raiser in this country.
“D.”: An example of the “drunk’s luck”
of the private-inquiry agent was provided
last week during the hearing of a Sydney
theatrical divorce suit. The detective
appeared in the home of the erring pair at
midnight. The able-bodied male victim of
this impudence (an actor who is usually
associated with rOles of reckless dare-
devilry) engaged the unauthorised caller in
amiable converse, and the lady “ asked per-
mission to he allowed to go to another room
and put on a dressing-gown!” The only
explanation of such complaisance is that the
mimes have been playing for so long in
Yankee “crook” plays that they have grown
to regard private-enterprise sleuths as per-
sons who are immune from the ordinary laws
governing burglary, breaking and entering,
etc. In the U.S.A. householders never assault
or shoot prognathous-jawed men who forcibly
enter their residences by night and appear in
bedrooms wearing bowler hats and chewing
long cigars. The cigar and the unremoved
hat form between them the sign-manual of
the Pinkerton man, whose person is sacred.
“Mancam”: A somewhat sozzled patron of
the drama disturbed the solemnity of Oscar
Asche’s production of “Iris” at Sydney Royal
the other night. He began his invidious re-
marks when the first act was nearly through,
but indignant S-s-s-sh-es made him simmer
down to sotto voce sneers. During the second
act he started again, and his criticisms were
so pointed that a hefty attendant interfered.
Resisting violently, the incoherent gentle-
man contrived to let the audience know that
he had been taken in—“dom lot av frauds.
....Not a colleen or a mavourneen in ut.
An’ ye call it ‘lrish’!” Then the darkness
swallowed him up.
“Norbell” : I think the movie monarehs will
fight shy of new phonographic attachments
which reproduce the spoken words' of the
acted scene (B. l/11/’23). Imagine hearing
one of our picture divinities rasping through
her million-dollar nose : “Say, kiddo, I ’low
I’m sure crazy ’bout yew! I’ll say you’re
the cutest ever. Oh, boy, ut’s fierce! Yew’d
betta awsk poppa right neow!” No, it
wouldn’t do.
“Orb”: If, as “G.A.C.” suggests (B.
l/11/’23), the Brisbane shows are begin-
ning to put up the shutters or work only
half-time because of tne approach of stim-
mer, then Brisbane is getting soft. Ive
played at Her Majesty’s and at the Royal
right through the hottest weather, and no
one seemed to mind. King ran shockers at
the Royal for over three years without a
break. On the torridest nights the hero
would wrap his fur-lined coat round the
hero-whine and her clieild when he found
them sweating in the snowstorm, and nobody
laughed. In those days the pieture-sliows
in the city, as well as the principal suburban
flickers, were indoors. There were at least
five “continuous” theatres that kept their
house fans turning from 11 to 11 all the
year round. Brisbane liked its amusements
served up hot in those days. Has it really
altered so much?
“Intermingler”: Judgment was not the
only factor in Harry Rickards's success (B.
4/10/’23) ; luck had something to do with
it. When he visited Australia the first time
his luck was out, also his judgment. Harry
used to run a Sunday-concert boat on Syd-
ney Harbor. Anyone he could pick up at
the Point was good enough then, and they
were “few bob” days. When he opened m
the old Opera House, his big thing was
“Ta-ra-ra-boom-de-ay,” sung and danced by
24 girls in long skirts. I attended one of
the rehearsals, and have a lively memory of
’Arry importuning the. ladies 'Kick.
Kick! Kick up! Your legs won t come
off!” He wasn’t buying diamonds with that
show when Frank Smith died and the Al-
hambra started to go to pieces. Harry got
a Samaritan to finance him into the (■arrick.
caught the public fancy, and never looked
back.
Lines from London :
William Archer’s “Green Goddess” hud a highly-
successful start at the St. James’s, and looks like
repeating its American success. But it is nothing
more than Adelphi melodrama smartened with a few
modern notions; and Archer’s waggish brother-
critics, while praising the play as melodrama, affect
to be pained that the high-priest of Ibsenism should
have descended to writing popular stuff.
Somerset Maugham’.s “Our Betters” is a bitter
and very unpleasant satire on Anglo-American mar-
riages in high life. Marion Terry, Constance Col-
lier and Margaret Bannerman do their best to make
it, interesting, but one carries away the impression
that the subject can’t be satisfactorily treated on
the stage. Maugham guards himself against possible
actions for libel by a note in the programme that
none of the characters are intended as personal por-
traits.
We are promised a play on the theme of Lola
Montez. Born at Limerick —she was Irish on the
father’s side and Spanish on the mother’s Lola
captivated London with her Spanish dances, and,
bewitching the aged Ludwig, King of Bavaria, prac-
tically ruled that country for a couple of years.
Australia saw her in the roaring ’fifties, and there
is a good account of her lively doings at Bendigo
in William Kelly’s “Life in Victoria.” She died
in New York on Jan. 17, 1861, in her 43rd year.
“L.H.P.”: Reading some back numbers of
Glement Scott’s magazine, the Theatre, I
came across this: —
In New York, on October 11, Dion Boucieault,
after firing a preliminary volley of abuse at the
Press, withdrew “Rescued,” and played “Louis VI.”
at Booth’s Theatre, to introduce his son, Dion, as the
Dauphin. The debutant was very successful.
That was in 1879, when Dion G. was a
stripling of 20. He was 26 when he came to
Australia and 27 when he entered into part-
nership with Robert Brough.
“T.R.H.”: Barry Sullivan (B. 25/10/’23)
not only played Shakspeare in the local
dialect at “Owdham,” but burlesqued “East
Lynne” in the old wooden theatre in Bury,
nobbut six moiles fra’ Owdham, tha knaws.
He doubled the parts of Levison and Lord
Mountsevern, had Barbara Hare killed in
the railway accident, remarried Lady Isobel
to Archibald Carlisle and re-united Little
Willie to his fond parents. In the intervals
he ran competitions for the bulkiest baby
and the prettiest mill-girl. On the last night
of the competitions (and the season) the re-
conciliation of Isobel to Archibald was de-
layed by free fights among partisans of the
babies and the belles —fights in which there
was less fist-play than “purring” ; i.e., kicking
up and down the shins with pointed, iron-
bound clogs. Yes, Sullivan had a sense of
humor.
“Wilfrido”: Arthur, in his biography of
Sarah Bernhardt, refers to the popularity in
America of her Marguerite Gautier in “La
Dame aux Camelias,” now being murdered
on the films. There was an outcry against
it by the clergy, and on more than one occa-
sion the actress -was stoned. Bishops pro-
tested that she had been sent to corrupt the
New World (as if anyone could corrupt
America!) and that her art was an inspira-
tion from Hell. But congregations for-
bidden to witness the performance made
such a rush upon it that Bernhardt’s manager
was able to spare a few hundred dollars
from the receipts to give to the, poor. Years
ago in M.L. a minister named North made a
furious onslaught upon “The Girl from Rec-
tor’s,” and the profits were such that Hugh
Ward donated £lOO to the Children’s Hos-
pital in Wellington. No form of theatrical
advertising has more pulling power than a
denunciation from the pulpit.
A VALUABLE COMEDIAN.
[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
“Though the speech was mostly in serious vein,
it developed, toward the end, an acceptable sense
of humor, Mr. Bruce telling’ Iris first funny story in
public.”
Slick, sleek and sedate, from his elegant spats
Right up to his elegant tile,
So sober and serious-looking he chats
And orates, but there’s never a smile
Illumines his features, his hearers to cheer,
And they whisper, “A crusted old Tory:
And humorless, too!” A reproach, and a jeer,
Which never again we are likely to hear,
Since Bruce told his first funny story.
For stale, mouldy Politics now who will care?
He’s captured the grand old 8.P.,
His listeners henceforth for “laughs” all prepare,
A “funny man” labelled is he:
lie’s looked to for jokes, and each one’s sure to “go,”
Though the jest may be ancient and hoary,
So he’ll reel off his gags like a pantomine pro.
And Australia’s certain to get a good show
Since Bruce told his fh’st funny story!

THE firm of Paige Motors are primarily makers
of fine cars perfect in mechanical construction
—their entire personnel is arranged to build only
six-cylinder cars of the better kind, consequently,
the Paige-Jewett is an embodiment of the best in
engineering. The oiling system of the Paige-Jewett
circulates oil at a pressure of 20 to 40 pounds
through all working parts of the motor. This
means safe, sure lubrication, smooth running
devoid of friction and noise, and lengthens the

ANSWERS TO CORRESPONDENTS,
No notice (except of a hostile character ) will he
taken of communications insufficiently stamped.
Name and address must appear on the MSS. No
liability is undertaken re contributions volun-
tarily submitted; and no MS. will be returned
unless stamps accompany.
J.Q.: Yes; but everybody doesn’t reach the
retiring age, does he ?. .. . County Cork: The bulk of
the money advanced for land purchase in Ireland
was advanced so recently that the Acts authorising
the business were only passed between 1903 and
1911. And you say it has already been repaid.
So apparently it has been possible to collect big
debts when it wasn’t possible to collect a census.
Still, have it your own way. ... P. Ordet: Thanks ;
the young man who did it has already been put on
the black list... .H.D.M.: Regret the space isn't
available. Every week enough articles are sub-
mitted for the Red Page to till the whole Bulletin.
....Ensign: Guess you’re right and the other man
wrong; but it is too late now. .. . Piccy: But surely
that is splitting straws. It would be just as reason-
able to say that a man who spends his days and
nights urging people not to go near the water ought
to get the Royal Humane Society’s medal for saving
lives from drowning.... H. 8.: Of course; but you’re
doing just what he wants someone to do....Aarvi:
No space for long quotations; you’ll have to learn
the art of condensation.... Student: (1) Hol-
man became N.S.W. Premier on June 30, 1913;
(2) Watt was Vic. Premier from May, 1912, to July,
1914, with a break of 13 days in Dec., 1913 ; (3)
don’t know who is Australia’s best poet—this page
is more concerned with the worst Keith G.: A
good enough little essay; but you really haven’t
got under the surface of the man A.5.H..: An
old idea and not a'bright one. Something better
than that should come from your tropic isle... .
S.F.F.: It doesn’t develop anything fresh or make
any strong, point E.J.G.: The “Honest Folk”
yarn states what has been, said so often that it has
become a commonplace E.W. (Byron B.) : The
verse is terrible.... Eleanor; Glad you found it rest-
ful in the train at eventide; b’ut why write in
antique English? Didst feel it necessary to ease
thy restful soul?. .. .L.L. (Bclmore) : Your verse
moves ad though it has pebbles in its b00t5....
Notya: Good enough idea, but poorly worked 0ut....
A.T.A.: “The Woman" is good verse, but it handles
an old theme without a new glimmer. .. .The Wan-
derer: Not up by some distance. ... R.R. (Samlgate) :
Wild, improbable stuff V.T. (Vic.): Gets very
i near.. . .R.D.8.11.: Not enough in the yarn as it is
t01d.... Augustus W.: Sing on, 0 Prophet-bard of
evil:—
Australians, you never was like your forfathers,
Nither true to your fellowman, nithei**to -vouself :
You have taught your chiklern militaristic, rather —
Civilisation and Humanity in kind of serf;
\ou have put back their minds for a hundred years,
taught them to hate mankind and to make War.
ou al| d your Rulers made terror and fears;
To foreign citizens their homes 1011 did mar.
loii pretend to be friends, and shake hand,
"While in the other hand you got a knife;
You don’t want any foreigner here to land,
You are ready to make it hard or wreck his life.
!.••-. -Christine L.: That might have made a sketch,
but you did not take enough trouble' with it....
R.A.YY: Impossible in that form T.G.P.W.;
Doesn’t strike us W.G.W.: Can’t you give it
smarter handling?... .Quidnunc: No yarn there
F.D.F. : The worst verse we’ve seen for a couple of
days.... J.S.H.: You are imitating poor models.
There is no freshness and original thought in them.
A.B. (Elsternwick) : The point at the end is
too small. ... A.R.N.: ,lt seems to be about nothing
at all.... Alice X.; Just a pile of words unattract-
ively thrown together. .. .J.M.M.: Thin thing spun
out to tediousness... .L.C.G.: Not for us L. 11.5.:
The solemn movement of blank verse seems hardly
the medium for saying that you have had too much
marmalade. .. .J.H.M.; Have no recollection of a
previous story. Translations and adaptations are
no us e to us, anyhow. .. .J.A.J.: The verse is very
thin and weak.... W.M.YV.; “.Luck” is too crude ;
“Advice” lias only the material for a par. . . .D.H.R.:
Not up... . Tarago: The sketch needs more meat....
Flicker: Great waste of words on a small idea
Harry P.: Verse very poor; prose misses, but not
by so much. . . .Namoi: Yarn doesn’t make us believe
you’re dealing with reality.... Jackson D.: The
mild, sad tale of the umbrella goes back.... M.S.
(Tor wood) : Off the target.... : The method
spoils it D.L.W.: Too feeble to flutter past the
door. .. .T.McD.: Suitable for a large-sized album.
... . Rustyface: You don’t quite get it... .W.E.C.;
There’s a little feeling, but too little skill R.L.
(Woollahra) : We note that Manly is “sweet”.. . .Jack
W.: The “Dad” gag is not new. .. .Florence B.:
Terrible... .Zellof: Old ideas made into a poor stew.
.... Harry W.: It could be worse; but yo"u haven't
much notion of verse.... Eileen: Your friends are
wrong if they think your poems are “not too bad.”
Jimcrow: Very poor stuff T.E. (Townsville):
Ihe B. can’t consider an article which is “being
sent to several leading Australian papers”....
I .C.K.: Y ou’ve swallowed a lot of rubbish some-
where. Why should payment by results “mean
reduction of piece-work rates till the most efficient
worker draws bare subsistence wages”? The coal-
miner has had a pretty long- experience of piece-
work ; and he would tear up the mines rather."than
give up that basis of payments So would the
shearer.... Paul C.: No new light on the old prob-
lems. .. .H.C.W.: What a tangle of words !. .. . Geo.
D.: “Gettin’ Even” is well enough told; but you
can see the end afar off. . . .Francis D.: Scarcely in
qur line. .. . D.0.C.: There is no thought of ycur
own in it....M.M.: “Funeral” doesn’t convince ua
that it’s true. And why always go to the sordid?
•.. .Maigot M.: “Tragedy ’ hardly well enough
written; bit there’s the real stuff in it. You will
arrive yet T.R.S.: Hobble yourself; your habit
of wandering seems otherwise incorrigible
8.C.F.: Afraid we can’t give him any more space for
the moment.... Three Tees: Too obscure. Ninety
people in a hundred won’t be bothered with such
verse; of the 10 who profess that they like and
admire it we suspect nine to be humbugs.
TO ARTISTIC (AND INARTISTIC)
CORRESPONDENTS.
L.W.: Pencil drawing no use; photo out of Bul-
letin line. .. .lI.A.McK.: Just an old smoke-room
.tarn badly illustrated... .W.H.D.: Some distance
to go yet....W.M.: Your hobby seems to be col-
lecting old gags. .. . H. 0.: A terribly deformed men-
dicant .. .. K. F.: Misses T. W.-S.: Hysterically
unexciting idea. .. .A.T.C.: Drawing very wobbly in
spots. .. jT.G. : A good joke, but not worth printing
twice within a month.... T.W.: A very fine example
of how not to do it J.A.E.; Right off the tar-
get....T.S.; Some drawing in them; but not
enough to get through R.S.R.: Unimpressive
version of old gag. .. . D.B. c Clearly you are no
bootmaker 8.E.8.: “Have I given this joke the

"Marching Order ”
for the "GREYS”
It may surprise many
that the dress depicted
here is described as
u marching order” At
this period (1893) the
only conspicuous differ-
ence between parade dress
and marching order was,
that in the latter the
white plume was absent
from the bearskin .
QUALITY is sometimes too elusive to be defined
—in "GREYS” cigarettes it is too defined to be
elusive. Made with scrupulous care from the choic-
est Virginia leaf they are as wholesome as mountain
air. The most satisfying cigarettes you can buy—•
and the fullest valve for money.

Isko Automatic Electric Freezing Machines
Your own Cold Storage
Plant at Home.
ISKO is a simple device that
Manufactures Cold, convert-
ing your Refrigerator into a
miniature, self-operating Cold-
storage plant connected with the
house current, doing away entirely
with the use of Ice in the home as
a refrigerating agent, at the same
time introducing a method of
food preservation more conveni-
ent, more sanitary, more economi-
cal than that afforded by blocks
of melting ice.
It is an independent unit, can
be attached to any refrigerator or
Ice-box, and is absolutely fool-
proof.
It is automatic in operation and
so simplified mechanically that it
needs no expert attention.
It makes fifty cubes of ice every
day.
The cost of current is trifling,
and the machine can be worked
on any voltage from 32 Volts up-
wards.
mts»
‘ J
THE chambers and motor are
mounted on a single base,
which may be set on top of
the refrigerator or in an adjoining
room. The glycerine-tank, made
in sizes to fit various standard re-
frigerators, is placed in the ice
compartment and connected to
the machine by two seamless
copper tubes. The only moving
parts of Isko are the the two rotat-
ing gears of the compressor,
which run submerged in a sealed
chamber of oil and are direct con-
nected to the
motor. The refrigerant—a harm-
less gas—is also sealed in its
chamber. When cooled under
moderate pressure it becomes a
liquid, and as such is supplied to
the expansion coil of the tank,
where it expands into gaseous
form, extracting the heat from the
chest. When it has absorbed its
quota of heat the compressor re-
moves it from the expansion coil
and delivers it to the condenser
chamber, where the water, circu-
lating through the cooling coils,
carries off the heat, and the gas
again becomes a liquid and is
ready to start on another journey.
This simple process is carried on
in continuous cycles. Isko is auto-
matically operated, and can be set
to maintain any suitable degree of
cold in the refrigerator, the cur-
rent clicking on and off at the pre-
determined temperatures.
Refrigerator Cabinets made to order and machines fitted.

“Sturt”: Adelaide has just had its third
“Gem Week” for boosting Australian jewels.
South Aus. has a great variety of valuable
stones, though lacking in the precious metals;
and the borrowed products vary from New
Guinea tortoiseshell to Westralian pearls—
with the opal everywhere conspicuous.
“Adelaide”: E. 11. Luke, a wine expert,
just back from England and Cape Town,
laughs at a recent S’African claim that its
wines are beginning to supplant the Austra-
lian in the English market. The Cape wines,
he says, are "conspicuous by their absence”
in Britain, and when he passed through S.
Africa the makers there were complaining
of a local surplus, and asking if there would
be a market for it in Australia.
* * * *
"Haka” : My boy came home from school
the other night and told me that he had to
get a new geography-book. I shelled out for
a “New and Revised Edition," and on glanc-
ing through it learned that the town of Mil-
ton (M.L.) is noted for its potteries. In
1917 I recorded in The Bulletin that the
four pottery kilns which were notable land-
marks had been toppled over, and the scene
of a once-flourishing industry left desolate.
But it takes more than half a dozen years
to get a thing like that into the heads of
revisers of school-books.

“Adelaide”: An Adelaide grocery firm is
offering to supply, carriage-free anywhere
in Britain, at a stated price, a Christmas
case of assorted dried fruits from S.A., in-
cluding pears, prunes, raisins, currants, apri-
cots and peaches, with almonds and walnuts.
Hundreds of people have taken the chance
of making the gift, the Dried Fruits Asso-
ciation is sending a feiv to prominent Lon-
doners who may be trusted to talk about
them, and the Government has given its
blessing to the excellent advt. the State is
getting.

"Cartot”: Country Pastures Protection
Boards in N.S.W. are howling at the
Forestry Department’s regulation that when
reserves are ringbarked, 10 honey-producing
trees shall be left on each acre. Most of
them argue that the trees will interfere with
the growth of grass, and few seem to see
that, whereas a little more herbage might be
produced in this generation, there wall be
little grass or anything else later on in an
area totally denuded of its trees. The pity
is that the regulation stops at 10.
“Birre Gurra”: Montville (Q.) has an
entry for the Jack-of-all-trades Stakes. He
keeps a store whose stock is as varied as Aus-
tralia’s railway gauges. In his spare time
he raises and propagates citrus-trees, and
grows flowers and vegetables for sale; and
in his odd moments he is watchmaker, tin-
smith, photographer, suit-cleaner, mechanical
and electrical engineer, and repairer of any-
thing from a safety-pin to a motor-lorry. He
built his own store, dwelling and garage,
and his car is kept beautifully tuned. His
name is just Smith.
* * * *
“P-X.” : Elwood Mead’s next big job wall
be to advise on the possibilities of irriga-
tion in Palestine ; meantime he has been
looking over the Dutch Indies and watching
the little brown man perform wonders with
his rice patches. On the ship that took the
Californian professor north there was a
party of Victorians who were going to see
wliat could be done wdtli cotton-growing in
Timor. Apparently it is in the eastern or
Portuguese end of the island that the party
has got hold of an area of 4000 acres, and
it is so satisfied with local conditions that it
has already bought ploughs and other plant.
There is a native population of about half a
million to draw 7 on, and most of them have
done a bit of agriculture.
* * * *
“Kerbstone”: The coming of the North
Shore Bridge will involve the reconstruction
of a good deal of Sydney. Princes-street will
be given a roadway 120 ft. wide. York and
Kent streets will spread out to 100 ft., and
the latter, which ends now in Liverpool-
street,is likely to have a crescent-shaped exten-
sion to take it into George-street. With the
Darling Harbor, reclamations, Bathurst-
street also will be widened and run right
across where Darling Harbor used to be;
and there is a proposal to take the other
end of it through Hyde Park to connect with
Oxford-street. In former days a howl about,
“filching the people’s parks” would have been
raised; but an overgrown city has to adopt
desperate plans to meet its traffic problems.

by the big- pineapple companies should have an
interest for Australian fruitgrowers. Several years
ago the sugar men found that by making rolls of
a coarse paper from the cane refuse and laying
it over the cut-over fields the weeds were smothered,
while the young canes had strength sufficient to push
through. It has now been proved that rolls of asphalt
roofing-paper can be used similarly for other
crops. The seed-bed rows are first prepared, then
a two-horse machine lays the roll of paper and
covers the edge with dirt to hold it down. Holes
are made in the paper with sharp sticks and plants
inserted. Over the three-year trial-period the in-
crease in fruit yield has been on pineapples 25 to
50 per cent. Sumatra tobacco, grown in Florida,
shows practically 50 per cent, increase in yield of
dried leaf.

“Ponipe” : The stranding of the 8.-P. liner
Montoro on October 10 after she had bumped
into an outlying patch of the Barrier Reef
made it necessary for a quantity of valuable
cargo to be jettisoned. No vultures ever
gathered quicker round a carcase than sal-
vagers round the Montoro’s dump, which
consisted largely of pearl-shell placed aboard
at Thursday Island. One enterprising pearler
w 7 ho happened to be on the spot got busy in
double-quick time, and when the news-
reached them others hastened down from the
island in launches. Pearl-shell degenerates
quickly when submerged, and in such cir-
cumstances it w 7 as no good waiting for a
legal opinion as to the ownership of the
goods. The mishap to the Montoro was as
good as a gold-find to the salvers, for pearl-
shell. even at its present low price, pays
handsomely when it can be scooped up in
cwt. lots, all ready cleaned and graded, off
a bottom that is exposed at low tide.

CAR EQUIPMENT
includes only lines which, while elegantly finished to add to the
car s beauty, are primarily designed to render useful service and
supply increased enjoyment to the motorist.
Think of the vital information that is
furnished by a Stewart Speedometer.
Your total mileage—the speed you are
making—distance covered since morning
-—the service your tyres are giving you
—your car’s petrol consumption. These
are but a few of the many essential things
you can ascertain from a Stewart
Speedometer.
A slight touch of the Switch Button will
send out from the Stewart Warning Signal
a clear, unmistakable note of warning.
The Stewart Vacuum Feed System is now
recognised universally as essential to
ensuring at all times a regular supply of
petrol to the carburetter, thus enabling
the steepest hills to be taken without
effort.
The Stewart Searchlight is invaluable for
night driving, illuminating disagreeable
sections of the road, signs, house num-
bers, etc.
By operating the foot brake in the usual
manner for stopping, the driver automati-
cally causes the red hand of the Stewart
Stop Signal to warn any traffic approach-
ing from the rear.
The Stewart Bumper, while costing a little
more than some others, has been proved
by experience to be the most genuine and
efficient protector ever made. Examine
the cars you pass, and observe the large
and increasing number that are now being
equipped with Stewart Guards.

: At a recent Sydney gathering of
converts one man said that, though once
addicted to sinful pleasures, he had neither
drunk, smoked nor gambled for 20 years.
“Sometimes, though, when I see others play-
ing, I feel I would like a game of poker,”
he admitted.
Though I am a saved and happy brand
Old longings sometimes pull.
’Tis oh for the touch of a poker hand
And the feel of a “house” that is full.
“F.A.” on a dying craft: —
The Sydney cabby is dying hard. John Hart was
the pioneer of the “Leave-it-to-you-sir” business in
Australia, and occupied the first rank in the con-
tinent in November, 1830. He used to collect six-
pence for helping “fares” up the King-street hill
from the King's wharf, where he sat for many a
jobless hour in impecunious solitude. Later on,
in the ’thirties, the cheap horseflesh and restfulness
of the calling brought along competition. Finan-
cially, however, the business has been a sorry one
from the start, and few cabbies ended up with the
price of the last earthly drive. The horse-drawn
conveyance has been doomed ever since the taxi
arrived, but a few hansoms are still running, because
the taxis have a minimum rate exorbitant enough to
block the short-distance fare. The taxi won’t finally
chase the cab off the streets until it takes less than
three bob to start its innards revolving.
“Calcite” : A few years ago in the Crook-
well (N.S.W.) district a well-known Hiber-
nian, before passing out, left £4O for the
bhoys to give him “a dacent wake.” After
the corpse had been placed in the coffin the
latter was stood on end with the lid off, and,
a good supply of liquor having been laid in,
the fun commenced. It lasted for six days,
the corpse being drenched with liquor at
each toast. On the fourth day matters
weren’t altogether satisfactory from an
olfactory point of view, and horse-manure was
ignited in the coffin as a counterblast. This
burnt a large hole in the side of the shell,
but the ghoulish ceremony was- continued.
The fifth day the local pub ran dry and a
trip was made to Crookwell to replenish
supplies. There the story of what was hap-
pening got afoot, and the sergeant of police
went out and ordered prompt interment.
“D.F.”: Did La Perouse visit the Tas-
manian coast before he went on the reef at
Vani-koro and after he touched at Botany
Bay in 1788? It has been usually assumed
that he did not, and that early statements
about traces of him having been found on
Bruni Island are the result of wrong con-
clusions about marks left by the later French
navigators, D’Entrecasteaux and Baudin.
But J. Moore-Robinson, who edits the his-
torical records of Tasmania when no Gov-
ernment publicity jobs can be found for him,
has run across another bit of evidence. In
1851 a police boat was sent down to Esper-
ance or somewhere thereabouts to secure a
tree-trunk with an inscription said to record
the visit of La Perouse-—the evidence, if
obtainable, was to go to P'aris. The expedi-
tion found what was presumably the right
trunk, but on the way back ran into a storm
and had to jettison it. A brief reference to
this adventure appeared in a newspaper of
the time, but search has failed to reveal any
official report on it. Nor can any record be
found of the information which led to the
expedition being authorised.
“Saaedi”: “C.0.M.,” in “Australia and
Carthage” (B. 11/10/’23), says that, while
tiie farmer of Australia is sometimes a home-
builder and lover of the soil, the grazier is
always inspired by the idea of exploitation.
There are numerous grazing properties in
Australia that have been held and dwelt on
by the one family for 30 years and over.
Surely this indicates some inclination for
home-building, gome people find it impos-
sible to think of a grazier save as a wealthy
individual who manages his station from a
city residence, and is a menace to the
nation’s progress and prosperity. What is
true is that the majority of pastoralists are
men in a small way. who live on their own
land and love it well, as it is of the nature
of man to do in such circumstances. For
the rest, the grazier is not generally a
menace to progress, because most of the land
used for sheep is in the present stage only
suitable for sheep. (Incidentally, much of
the land described as farming bv closer-settle-
ment fanatics is only suitable for sheep.)
And as to prosperity, I cannot imagine what
would pay our bills and keep our railways
running if the wool industry got down on to
its belly along with the other chronic ear-
biters.
“Pollio” learns things about Australia:—
W. 11. Ifould, of the Sydney Public Library, is
lecturing on “Australia Still Incognita,” or words
to that effect. He’s right. It is. Here i's my bag
during the last month.
Hutchinson's Magazine has a reference to “Cir-
cular Wharf, Sydney,” and the N. S. Wales Governor-
elect claims a niece who married “the Vicar of Adel-
aide,” and admits a belief that Sydney University
takes hoys of 12 as pupils. On the authority of the
Daily Mail I find that Bligh, after Johnston had
hauled him out from under the bed, “was placed on
board a boat and ordered to quit. He made his
way to the South Sea Islands.” In C. E. Montague’s
“Fiery Particles” an Irish digger used to run wax-
works in “the Irish quarter of Sydney,” and lost all
his money by substituting models of Psyche and
Cleopatra and Diana for Ned Kelly and Charles
Parnell. Then there is Mary Jay in the United
Empire, who groups Henry Kingsley, E. J. Brady
and “brilliant John Yarreli”—did John Farrell ever
write novels ?—-as fiction-writers of a distant past.
But the gem is a Bully Hayes novel by a certain
Gordon Young. Australians, we learn, were either
brought from England in chains or had fathers in
whose palms “M” had been burned. It is natural,
therefore, that the story should begin in a shanty
where “a discouraged squatter was doleful]}- pour-
ing- out a tale of drought and myalls to a miner.”
Near by, it would seem, a Cook’s Tourist Bureau
directed white men to places where they could eat
of the lotus and drowse in the lap of a brown girl.
This sounds improbable, I know; but Gordon dis-
tinctly says the white men did this “under the
guidance of another Cook,” and he could hardly
have been thinking of Joseph. The exact location
of the shanty is doubtful, but it was near Mel-
bourne, three miles from the diggings, and two weeks
by sailing-vessel from Broome (W.A.), so it should
be easily identified. A vessel seized by Bully Hayes
in the neighboring bay, however, does not go to
Broome, though Hayes announces that it will; in-
stead, it navigates the “Tasmanian Sea,” is beached
or. the west coast of Tasmania, where convicts were
“formerly thrown on to the island and girdled with
bloodhounds,” and is forced to sea again because
“v.-ood was the only thing we found on the island
to carry away.”
Who said the war had put Australia on the map?

“I have been a master hairdresser in Sydney for
the past 35 years, and during that time have tried
many shaving soaps, with a view of discovering one
suitable for use in my saloon, and after giving the
Rexona Triangular Shaving Stick a trial, great was
my surprise to And I had at last secured a suitable
soap, one which has given entire
satisfaction. It lathers excel-
lently and softens the beard
better than other soaps I have
used, and at the same time it
leaves the face free from all
irritation.
“I have always been a great
advocate for Rexona Tri-
angular Shaving Stick, as
I realise that it has no
equal, both for preserving
the skin and its economi-
cal value.

Rexona Shaving Soap to
my friends and customers,

will be rewarded after a

Rexona Shaving Soap will be found the most economical Shaving Stick on the

the face and apply the Shaving Soap dry. A few applications with the shaving brush
will quickly produce a thick, creamy lather, which lasts and thoroughly softens the
beard leaving the skin in a healthy and hygienic condition after the shave.
Everyone should use a Medicated Soap for shaving* for,
after going over the face with the razor and removing the

Sand.
[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
PRONE upon the sparkling summer
beach I lie in drowsy mood,
Listening to an eerie voice that
pierces joy of waves wind-curled:
7 am the Sand, the End of Things; in many
places many lined,
Yet through all guises still the same I
weave the death-clothes of the world.
“Would you turn from line-eyed Heaven to
the dead stare of the sand?
Listen: like the scrape of scaly serpents
slides my toneless laugh!
Let me trickle through your fingers, hold me
in your hollowed hand,
Read me; over luried ages I write Nature's
epitaph.
“Hear mt, while those romping children
crowned with seaweed diadems
Fashion castles for the rainbow treasures
of the beach they cull:
They play with sand, with Me. undreaming I
may play with hidden gems
In a dead queen's tiring room, or whistle
through an emperor's skull.”
Seagulls pass on wings of silence, trailing
dainty coral feet,
Drop into' the shining shallows, nun-like in
their grey and snow;
Over tussock grass and daisies’ guileless
stare the air comes sweet,
Limpid wavelets la)) and chuckle; still the
voice speaks, grim and slow:
Carved in dry grotesques of billows ribbed
and rippled by the wind,
Though an army cannot move me I am
moulded by a breath ;
I bring dreams and fascination, I bewilder
and I blind,
Or I spread, a couch for languor. I am
comfort; I am death.”
Death? What is it but a syllable this tur-
quoise afternoon?
Happiness is like a halo round each life
upon the shore;
Petal-flakes of song and laughter, tossed
afloat by winds that croon.
Strew the present like gay blossoms, hide
the past for evermore.
“Let me trickle through your fingers, every
grain a century
That will whisper intimate tales of lives
forgotten long ago;
Hold me in your hollowed hand, each grain
a globe of crystal — see!
Pictures form and change and vanish, pic-
tures only you may know.
“Here is one. That girl from Shiraz — sullen,
fierce and, half-afraid,
She danced before you while on barren
Kara Kum the sun went down;
You who bought her sat impassive, though
she quivered, writhed and swayed
Till the brazen anklets shrilled about the
curve of insteps brown.
“Yet you watched her lissome body, moulded
to its scarf of gauze,
Barred with smoky gold and orange change-
ful as the sunset sky.
Watched until she hesitated, panted, to a ting-
ling pause,
Dropped her eyelids, sidelong smiled. ...
the grains of sand, blew whispering by.
'‘See, the great flanks of the desert seem to
heave beneath the stars!
See, the tent, fringe trembles, by the sultry
breath of midnight fanned!
All forgotten? Even the memory of the
memory of old scars.
Passion, weariness and sorrow, all alike
are lost in sand.”
Ah, the freshness of the daylight! I glance
seaward and behold,
Little hands locked tight together—a
festoon of rosy rhyme—
Three gay babies wet and naked dare the
foam-edge, shrilly bold,
Weakness greater than all power, youth
triumphant over time.
‘'Sift the sand, look back a little! In the
orchard of the king,
Where above a singing brook the knotted
branches intertwine,
Stands the gardener's boy in thought forget-
ful, while the bird thieves cling
Pecking at the mulberry goblets brimming
with red violet wine.
“Would you know why orchard perfumes
wring your heart with primal mirth,
Why long grasses, water-shaken, tvake a
joy that aches like woe
As you muse on the eternal, awful young-
ness of the earth?
Thus you mused in Takla Makan twenty
centuries ago.
“Now I rule that king who ruled by terror
of his whispered name.
Over his proud palaces insidious sand-
waves curl and creep;
Still when searing tempests cleave me with
their scimitars of flame,
Bare, sun-tortured mulberry branches
glimmer faintly white with sleep.”
Open Heaven is clear with deep on deep of
blue tranquillities;
Sand is only sand to play with, made for
trifling hands’ employ.
What to me are Asian ruins and the ghosts
of buried trees
In a world of arid shadows? Life is warm
and full of joy.
“Look again! A. woman loan,dering, reeling
like a thing accurst,,
Led a little stumbling maiden through the
waste simoom, had dried.
Both were wan with bitter terror, and their
lips were black with thirst —
Sudden, round the dead thorn-bushes,
slunk a lion, agate-eyed.
“Swift the woman thrust herself before the
child in dumb despair;
And the three one hideous breathing-space
stood motionless as stones.
Then he sprang—why do you shudder? What
is it you whisper there? —
Not her child, they were fond sisters'?
You should know, / hid your bones.''
Little, trusting Mariamne, whom my life-
blood could not save—-
Still that shrieking anguish drives me
from the sleep of happy night—
Mariamne, little sister! Piteous eyes beyond
the grave,
Sadder, dearer yet than any love-flower
bordering memory’s flight!
Oh, away with cheerless fancies ’neath a sun
so wildly sweet,
Living fellow-folk around me, clean sea-
salt in every breath!
I will walk and feel the pressure of the kind
earth to my feet,
Firmly crushing down the faint hiss of
defiance: “7 am death.
“ Go , then, talcing this last ivord: beyond your
future’s shielding veil,
Far below the dimpling surface, far from
friendliness of land,
Icy, lonely, never a stir to mar its shimmer,
ashen pale.
Under a black night of water, grey and
sodden waits the Sand.”

A Chinese Wedding.
[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
OLD Lim Sam Kee favored us with an
invitation to the wedding of his
eldest sou. Lim is one of the wealth-
iest towkays in Penang—perhaps the wealth-
iest. He has visible and prosaic sources
of revenue in cocoanut and rubber estates in
province Wellesley, tin-mines in Perak, gam-
bir plantations in Kedah and tobacco con-
cessions in Sumatra. He draws revenue
impartially from the industry of natives in
territory whose security is guaranteed by
Dutch and English, and from the Siamese
Malay States where security does not exist at
all. His mysterious and romantic Siamese trea-
sure is precarious because Siamese control
is not so stable as Dutch or British. On
the other hand the dividends are far greater.
Lim is actually the rajah of one of the Siam-
ese States, and when he is not dallying with
his harem in his large brick pavilion sur-
rounded by immensely high walls in Penang,
he is squeezing taxes out of Malay fisher-
men and jungle produce out of timid abori-
ginals, and behaving at one and the same
time with the despotism of an Oriental
potentate and the irresponsibility of a cap-
tain of industry.
Lim is the latest of a long dynasty of
Chinese adventurers who have imposed them-
selves on the simple Malay for hundreds of
years. In his veins is some of the blood of
Koxinga, the great Chinese freebooter, who
drove the Dutch out of Formosa, and would
have made a Chinese colony of the Philip-
pines, and might, with his fine army and
navy, have even forestalled white dominion
throughout the Archipelago, if death had not
intervened. Long before the white man
came, Lira's ancestors had been established
here. They had strong Chinese kingdoms or
lcongsis in Borneo. Sometimes the white
man tumbled them off their thrones or out
of Court favor; but they were not in the
least perturbed. They proceeded to fight him
with his own weapons. They bought up
ricketty old cargo steamers, and competed
with him for the carrying trade, inci-
dentally laying the foundations for the great
modern Chinese steamship lines. They lent
money to the natives at cent, per cent., and
a sound banking system grew out of the
business. Wherever the white man built
cities they acquired real estate, so that the
Caucasian found himself the tenant of Chi-
nese landlords on territory he had won by
hard-bought treaty or hard-fought war. The
Dutch massacred the yellow interlopers in
thousands, the Spaniards in tens of thou-
sands. It made no difference. They re-
turned and multiplied.
Lim had no education to speak of him-
self, but he was shrewd • enough to see
that the binomial theorem would be of more
use in modern commerce than the abacus.
He therefore sent his son to Harvard to
get a thorough grounding in the sciences
and arts of his white competitors. The boy
returned with a splendid modern educational
equipment, a perfect Harvard accent, a taste
for baseball, American football and most of
the other outward accomplishments of an
American undergrad, but with his heredi-
tary business sense unimpaired.
In an unguarded moment he had- talked
with enthusiasm of a Boston girl who had
apparently listened to his tales of Oriental
splendor, and become enamored of his roman-
tic person. Whereupon Lim, with almost
too much haste for Chinese conventions, had
arranged a marriage.
Our rickshaws sped up the long drive to
Lim’s mansion. It had more the appear-
ance of a museum or a charitable institution
than a private dwelling. Paper lanterns,
lighted inside with electric bulbs —not the
frail, tawdry affairs with which we decorate
our festivities, but huge and wonderful lan-
terns of fantastic shape and crawling with
dragons and lucky characters —hung all
along the drive and outlined the wedding-
cake architecture of the house. Arc lights
blazed on the lawns, lighting up a brass
band of Malays. Chandeliers scintillated
in every room—not one chandelier to each,
room, but dozens. Gilt-framed mirrors were
everywhere—set in gigantic semi-European
sideboards, in the backs of chairs, above
mantelpieces; leaning against walls, hung
up by cords like pictures, propped up on
easels; imbedded in the ceilings. And every
mirror flung back the hundreds of reflected
lights and the reflections of the reflections,
until one crept into each fresh room tremb-
ling in every nerve and feeling like a leather-
jerkined man-at-arms loose amongst the
lances of contending hordes of armored
knights.
The place was full of stone-paved vesti-
bules and grand staircases and titanic land-
ings and more electric lights and more mir-
rors. Besides the brass band on the lawn
playing Scottish airs, there was a Javanese
gamelang brought over from Sumatra play-
ing wild melodies, to which two Malay rong-
gengs shuffled and turned, and on the floor
above a Chinese orchestra banged and crashed
and faded away, and then came back again
with the effect of a mountain of tin col-
lapsing upon the floor.

He Sleeps Like a Child.
A good night’s sleep is
the finest medicine in the
world.
No matter how tired,
how worn-out you may be
after a hard day’s work, if
you can go to bed and
sleep calmly and soundly
for seven or eight hours,
you will wake up in the
morning alert and vigor-
ous, your strength re-
newed, your whole body
revitalised by the refresh-
ing influence of peaceful
slumber.
If you are not sleeping as
you should, you owe it to
yourself to take your
health in hand at once.
Nine times out of ten there
is something wrong with
your internal system. You
are tied down to the busy
life of the city, where you
get little fresh air and
exercise, and are often
obliged to snatch unsuit-
able meals. Your food is
not properly assimilated;
indigestion and dyspepsia
are marking you down for
their prey.
All this is bound to tell
upon you. What actually
happens is that your liver
and kidneys lose their
vigor, impurities find their
way into the blood stream,
the tone of the entire sys-
tem is lowered, and de-
pression, constipation, a
thousand and one ills fol-
low, bringing troubled
nights in their train.
Kruschen Salts will
alter this.
Just enough to cover a
sixpence taken every
morning in your break-
fast cup of tea will make
all the difference in the
world. All impurities are
removed from the body,
the blood stream regains
its richness and purity, the
whole system responds to
tonic influence. You en-
joy every moment of the
day, whether at play or at
work, and when night
comes you seek your bed
in the calm and happy
state of mind and body
that makes for sound and
refreshing sleep.
mm
Tasteless in Tea
Put as much in each
breakfast cup as will
lie on a sixpence.
It’s the little daily
dose that does it.
heP

S &
The dose of a sixpenceful taken
every morning is found in practice
to be just the right amount for a
most invigorating daily tonic. The
medicinal dose for persons suffer-
ing from pains of Rheumatism and
Gout or habitual Constipation, with
inactive liver, etc., is half to one
teaspoonful in a tumbler of hot
water before breakfast. Every
chemist sells Kruschen Salts—each
bottle contains 96 morning “six-
pencefuls”— enough to last three
months. Get a bottle to-day.

The central feature and originating cause
of all these stunning reverberations of light
and sound was in a smallish room upstairs.
She sat small and still like a frightened
mouse, on an ebony and gilt throne several
sizes too big for her, alongside another
throne, which was empty. She was dressed
in silk robes stiff with tinsel and embroidery,
and her face was heavily veiled. Behind
her was an ornate bridal bed, four-posted
and large enough to accommodate a pair
of giants, and hung with tapestries such as
European millionaires cannot buy in shops,
but which the poorest Chinese seem to be
able always to bring out from some mysteri-
ous hiding-place for occasions like this. Old
ladies in sloppy blue trousers stared at us
in hostile silence. We looked at the
bride; her blank veil stared back at us,
and nobody said anything. There was no-
thing to be said. We turned to go. The
old towkay met us at the door and took us
into a room, furnished with beautiful stiff-
backed Chinese chairs and tables, and lit
by a single lamp. It was like a haven of
refuge from the cyclonic illumination of the
rest of his house. He seemed ill at ease,
and pressed cakes, whisky and hot samshu
on us, begging us to wait a little for the
crisis of several days of celebration.
On the landing a tumult arose. The
bridegroom passed in immaculate evening-
dress, attended by a dozen friends, all young
men of the student class. We followed, and
crowded into the bridal chamber on the heels
of the bridegroom. Nobody seemed to know
what should be done next. A Taoist or
Buddhist priest might have been able to say.
but none was present. Somebody had started
a little incense-burning in front of the small
st jr inp in the corner, but only as a sort of
afterthought, mid small boys were letting oft
crackers outside. There were no rules for
this ceremony, which was not even a com-
promise between Western and Oriental cus-
toms, but merely suggested a complete
vacuum, a hiatus where traditions were not
Even the domineering old towkav seemed
temporarily to have abdicated.
Suddenly the bridegroom took the law into
his own hands. He was determined to sat-
isfy a natural curiosity inspired by the cir-
cumstance that he had not yet set eyes on
his future wife. He went up to the bride—
now standing and looking more than ever
like a frightened mouse—and began to undo

[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
THE Flanders mud was proving its
tenacity. Monty Maston knocked
out the ashes of his briar, cursing
heartily as drips from the dug-out roof per-
colated through his worn-out blanket-issue.
His brilliant invective aroused his pal Jimmv
Smith, erstwhile of East (Sydney. “It’s
like some of that weak coffee the last esta-
minet sold,” he laughed. “What was it you
called us just now?”
“Troglodytes.”
"What’s that—a new religion?”
“No, my boy. It means those who lived
in caves in the Stone Age. In those days
a man went looking for a wife with a club.
When found, he introduced her to the club ;
she was made a member, then dragged home
by the hair.”
. -Timmy Smith gasped. “Must have been
like Surry Hills on Saturday nights. Didn’t
they have any other amusements?”
No, only clubs; and clubs was trumps.
Force was the only law.”
i ! i o„ N ° P ict V res \ No ’ ai ‘bor trips?
Ao football. He thought a moment as a
whiz-bang shattered near by; then : “Monty
old sport, don’t you think that our bints to-
day are something like those cave-women-
you know —like someone to treat ’em rough’’’
Monty turned over to avoid the dripping
mud. Look here, Jimmy, you’re arrivin'*-
at the dangerous stage. If you develop into
a philosopher you will become alternately
miserable, optimistic, fatalistic and every
other ‘ic’ bar calisthenic. To plagiarise
woman is a wondrous creature. She’ll make
the supreme sacrifice a moment after doing
a paltry action. She will desert a good man
to cleave to a rotter. Work herself to death
in a good or bad cause, and then neglect
to cook the dinner. She will —oh, why enu-
merate? She’ll do anything she wishes, and
get away with it. Sufficient to say, Jimmy,
that you or I will never guess what she is
goin’ to do.”
Jimmy searched for a gasper. “S’truth,
Monty, you put the old Domain right in
front of me. I see you on a soapbox; my
hand is feeling for a tray towards your col-
lection. Where did y’ learn it? I’ll be on
picquet in an hour, and it’s too wet to sleep
here. Let’s hear the story. Go on. ‘Once
upon a time’!”
Monty dragged himself from his bed of
mud, and retrieved his last Capstan. “I
should resent your curiosity, old man, in
another place, but we may both pass out to-
night, so it will do no harm —and it may
relieve my mind. This ‘hop-over’ to-night’s
going to write ‘Finis’ for me, anyhow.” And
he sank into reflection.
“Once upon a time,” prompted Jimmy.
Monty clasped his cobber’s shoulder.'
“ ‘Once.’ Yes.”
“Have a cig.,” and Jimmy magnanimously
handed over the solace he was reserving for
a better time.
“I’d been through the University, Jimmy;
then I went to France, where I courted a
girl not 50 miles from where we are at pre-
sent doing an imitation of mud-turtles. In-
dustrial chemistry was my line, and I was
out to combine health, business and plea-
sure. The silk industry at Lyons interested
me, too; but so did the delights of Paris
and the cabarets of Montmartre.”
“Montmartre anything like Cairo?” gasped
Jimmy.
“My dear chap, Paris is at least artistic.
But don’t usurp the privilege of the Hun
to break the thread of my discourse.
I had been in France two months when I
met her. No, I won’t bore you with rhap-
sody. I’ll only say that her smile was like
the picture of Mona Liza. But it was not re-
flected in my dad’s face when I cabled home
informing him that I’d married Lois, the
famous artist’s model of the Quartier
Latin.”
“Something like the smile the old woman
used to give me when I lost my wages at
‘two-up,’ ” laughed Jimmy—“some smile.
And the old man—l suppose he went crook?”
“Not exactly. Dad is a humorist. Simply
cabled five hundred and advised me to finance
a revue. Strange to say, by that time Lois
was in revue.”
“She scaled you”
“Yes ; beauty like that of Lois is dynamite
in repose. A painter had taken Paris by
storm with. his picture ‘Delilah.’ Lois was
the model for that; and managers fell over
one another to secure her for the stage. I
did not relish it, so when I caught Ivaralsky,
of the Follies, kissing her in the wings I
lost all control and knocked him out. She
left me that day, and after a meteoric year
of success she gradually descended. Long
hours of dissipation told their tale. Man-
agers dropped her for the next sensation —
tango-dancers from the Argentine. She got
down to the absinthe cabarets in the Rue
St. Denis. I often helped her for old times’
sake, but, when I found her in the company
of a notorious apache, I gave it up in despair,
and sailed for good, clean, old Australia.”
Jimmy clasped his friend’s hand. “Tough
luck, old man. I suppose she died of
shicker?”
“Lord knows! She clung to her apache
more faithfully than she ever did to me.”
A head thrust itself into the dug-out. The
whisper of “Zero” brought the men to their
feet. Taking a pull at his cartridge-belt,
Jimmy said : “Buck up, old man ; you might
see her again. We’re in France, and any-
thing might happen.”
Monty smiled. “Give me your hand. In
a few minutes we will both be over the
top. Then my troubles will be solved. And
if we go across the Styx together, we shall
be in good company. Come on!”

Cut off and enfiladed, the —th Battalion
fought on. Tired arms pushed home the
bayonet with a grunt of weariness. No time
this to remember drill-book instructions.
Sufficient was it to get the bayonet thrust
in first. Sheer weight of Hun spilled over
the thin line, until a counter-attack by a
Queensland division drove them back. Night
fell with the intermittent glow of star-shell
and angry swish of machine-guns, all of
which added to the torments of the stricken
lying in No Man’s Land.
Monty Maston had lain under a scorching
sun for six. hours. This, succeeding a bit-
terly cold night, added tortures to his throb-
bmg side. Water was his sole thought—
water in huge volume. Bullets spat in the
congealed mud, preventing attempts at rescue
until the sun should have gone down.
i His ver i sh e yes were fixed upon a slight,
hooded figure that crawled from body to body
stretched in ungainly attitudes upon the soil.
Something vaguely familiar in the figure’s
outlines caused a momentary cessation of
his pain. At length the figure reached him;
a water-bottle pressed between his parched
lips brought some idea of Paradise to his
tortured brain. He gasped out thanks, and
babbled of the risk to the Samaritan who
raised his head.
“What is risk? What is life?” was the
reply. * I—great God, you !”
And to Monty Maston came a great revela-
tion. Here was Lois, on her arm the bras-
sard of mercy. Her hair white, her features
fined but the peace of a soul that had found
relief from a vain world revealed itself in
her sad smile.
Their lips met. No time this for explana-
tions Sim endeavored to stanch his wound ;
but the effort was broken by a burst of
machine-gun fire. The silence that followed
was deeper for the fury of the sound that
preceded it.
Monty’s dream had come true.
That night Charon’s Ferry crossed the
Styx. Among thousands of souls it con-
tained two that were apart from the rest
, „ s , ouls iri lia PPy communion: the
soul of Monty Maston and the complex inex-
plicable something which is the soul of a
woman.
