The Workman's Wife and White Slavery.
A little while since Governor Carington ex-
pressed his heart-felt sympathy with the wealthy
proprietors of an incinerated Sydney bedding-
factory, thereby affording them a splendid adver-
tisement at a small cost. His action was calculated
only to make fashionable a system of trade which
seems to ho the ultimate goal of all commerce*.
Wealth continues to aggregate in the hands of
the few, and the machinery by which wealth is
created seems to have a like tendency to accumu-
late beneath the control of a few gigantic pro-
prietaries. The process might be indefinitely
prolonged. His Excellency’s movement in the
matter can only be considered in the light of an
effort to accelerate it. Women are quick at
taking a hint. Shopping at the emporium has
now been sanctified by the vice-regal tear of
sympathy, and the probabilit y is that Mrs. and Miss
Australia will not allow the example to he lost
on them.
* * *
These are the days of alleged progress. There
is on every hand an effort being made to increase
the cumbrous machinery of life. There is on the
part of man a continual endeavour to get away as
far as possible from the primal and philosophical
conditions of exist ence. Among other of the so-
called advances of progress, the political, social,
and physical ensuffvagement of woman takes a
very important, if not the leading, place. We
have from time to time pointed our the incon-
gruities and anomalies of the unproven hypo-
thesis of the assumed equality of the sexes. We
have endeavoured to show that if women really
desired the full rights and privileges of mascu-
linity, they were—and are still-doing their
utmost to render the granting of such rights and
privileges an impossibility. In t his matter women
are their own worst enemies. Limited as is their
power at present, they are continually using it to
make more arduous and inconvenient the lot of
man. Uglesome as is the wretched drudgery
which now crushes down into the dirt the over-
driven labourer, women are ever on the alert,
stretching what little inventiveness they are in
possession of, not to ameliorate, not to brighten,
not to cheer the prospects of life to their hus-
bands, their sons, their sweethearts, but to render
them more hideous and to make the outlook for
humanity more repressively dull and hopeless.
Too true is it that woman’s enfranchisement is
synonymous with man’s enslavement. While
leagues are being formed, petitions are being cir-
culated for signature against the loathsome and
leprous Chinese, the wives of the men who
are struggling hardest to remove this saffron
curse, the mothers of the children whose future
may be embittered by Tartar competition, are too
often the women who encourage the plague-smitten
celestial by buying his vegetables, or who invest in
little artieles of frivolous female finery from the
Chinese hawker or the Lascar pedlar. Of course,
it would be illogical to blame the women alone.
They probably err from thoughtlessness and igno-
•ance. But. their husbands have no such excuse,
and no’mitlfr shiouid aUlow Ills wife to endanger, by
her actions,- the best interests of his order. The
workman who leagues against the Chinamen, and
yet in his own house eats the Chinese-grown beans
and cabbages; is far more to blame than his wife,
who has not been educated to hold such openly-
expressed anti-Tartar views.
* • *
In another direction, women are eqna’ly the
fees of those who axe compelled by law to labour
for and to keep them. It is the workman’s wife
who does her shopping at the universal em-
poriums and by her support, contributes to the
existence of the vast establishments witli their hun-
dreds of underpaid hands. It is the workman s
wife also who renders it impossible for the small
tradesman to make a living. Dozens of men who
would otherwise be keeping little shops of their
own are compelled to slave for a subsisteace-wage
in establishments which count their profits loy
thousands per annum, and which, in some in-
stances, have no regard for I he rights of their miser-
able dependents. The customers of the lower
class universal emporiums are not so much the
gilded sybarites of society, They are the wives of
workmen who combine in trades-unions to keep
up wages; who declare for eight hours’ work ;
who agitate for the expulsion of the Chinaman.
The workman’s wife is a late shopper. Her hus-
band labours only while the sun is in the heavens.
He endeavours to obtain Parliamentary repre-
sentation, in order to make eight hours labour
the law of the land. But his wife patronises the
system which compels white wage-slaves to stand
behind a counter; to smirk and to smile in
wearied agony until 9 o’clock p.m. on every
ordinary night, and on Saturday night until
11 o’clock p.m.; said white wage-slave
being afterwards engaged until 12.30 or 1
o’clock on Sunday morning in making things pre-
sentable to begin the next week’s round of drud-
gery. His Sunday is a day not of rest hut
of exhaustion, and the Pharisees who tole-
rate this system and who assist in its main-
tenance yet refuse to an honest man the right
to buy a glass of wine and a sandwich, or a
cigar, or some fruit for his wife on the Sabbath.
The Capitalist is allowed to go on scraping his
unholy profit off the bones of his wretched servi-
tors on the morning of the day sacred to Cant,
yet a Christian in an alleged Christian country is
not allowed to moisten his lips with anything un-
sanctified by the Church’s blessing.
* • *
The workman is after all his own enemy in re-
gard to early-closing. He either allows his wife
to cheaply surrender the advantages he has fought
for and secured by permitting her to indulge in
the paltry bliss of late shopping, or ho does it
himself in order that he may have his Saturday
afternoon playing cricket or solacing his soul with
the red-ochre joys of a game at Saturday soldiers.
He shuns the more decent places of business
which are open only during the hours of daylight ,
and spends his spare cash in order to swell the
profits of the conscienceless commercial leech. Of
the distilled agony and long-wrung-out woe of the
slaves for whom he should feel some brotherly
love he cares nothing. His own convenience is
served and, true to his selfish instincts, his
charity, like his independence, ends at home. As
the workman, who—by extraordinary good luck,
great powers of endurance, and perhaps, in some
few instances, a little out-of the-way abdity—has
managed to emancipate hinuelf fcom .he intoler-
able conditions of labour, and has se mred a posi-
tion as a capitalist, often makes the hardest task-
master ; so also the workman still engaged in
a frantic endeavour to keep his lower lip above
the tide-waters of competition pushes down every
other swimmer who does not happen to wear the
cap-hadge of his own particular boat-club. Per-
haps there is no more pathetic instance of man’s
inhumanity toman than that furnished by the work-
man in his treatment of his brother workman.
But by fighting against his fellow lie is weakening
his own cause. He is delivering over to Capital
a fresh gyve with which to bind himself. He Is
assisting in strengthening the hands of the
enslaver of his children.

In Melbourne during the early struggles of the
workmen to enforce the Shops and Factories Act
—which by tremendous exertion had, in the in-
terest of Labour, been made law—it was found
necessary to summon certain contumacious shop-
keepers who persisted in pandering to the love of
the workman’s wife for late shopping. But
an easy way was found by which the law could
be practically evaded. The offenders were tried
before brother shopkeepers—fence-taking and
parcel-tying Js.P.—who imposed merely nominal
fines, and by their remarks rather encouraged than
otherwise the hi w-hreakc s in their course of
defiance to the Act. This leminds ns of a para-
graph, written by the late Marcus Clarke, in
The Bulletin, to the effect that when
(in the days of the appointment of notorious
usurers to the Justiceship of the Peace) some poor
devil of a Civil servant disputed a pawnbroker’s
account for a pledged waistcoat the Bench re-
sembled Pelican Island in the breeding season by
reason of the multitude of beaks hanging over the
railing. In fact, a law can always be evaded very
adroitly when its administration depends upon
that legal anomaly and judicial merman—the J.P.
The system which tolerates an amateur judge
cannot be adequately dealt with in any language
whose basis is “ Webster unabridged.” The
justice of peace is usually ignorant of all law, and
Ids ignorance is only paralleled by his callous-
hided and supernal cheek. He is as unscrupulous
as any other quack, and if “ honoured ” with the
magic letters J.P. for merely political reasons—as
he almost invariably ia—the jobbery and corrup
tion of the transaction are quite as odious as the
circumstances surrounding the manufacture of a
politically-appointed Supreme Court Judge. But
it is the workman who sends to Parliament the
men who make the laws and the men who appoint
the amateur justices to administer them. If he
allows his servant to tie about him the bonds of
slavery he has himself to blame for it. He has
allowed the State to barter away his birthright
the land—and now he is anxious to lose the only
thing he lias —the hare name of a free man.

Chattel slavery was, perhaps, abolished too soon.
It would possibly have been better for humanity
had it been retained until the accomplishment of
the nationalization of all land. In a lecture at
Sydney the other night, it was shown clearly,
enough that the present system of “white-wage
sla very ” is a thousand-fold worse than the old and
sentimentally much-abused system of chattel
slavery. It is worse, indeed! Worse for the
worker, but better —so much better for the
remorseless capitalist . In days of old the slave-
owner tof necessity was forced to feed well
his property. When his slave sickened, he
naturally enough desired hts speedy cure ; and
should his chattel die, as die sometimes he would,
he was at least compelled to restore his body to
the earth like the body of any “ free ” man. The
white-wage slave of to-day, however, meets with
no such LucuLLUS-like indulgence. He receives
from Ills profit-sweating employer o'riiy d miser-
able dole—a bare subsistence-wage. By the
operation of Free Competition and the increased
facilities afforded by machinery, the dole is each
day growing more' diminutive, and the workman’s
fare is correlatively becoming coarser and coarser,
and less and less nutritious. .In some parts of
France, during, the 5 period immediately preceding
the French Revolution, the wretched chattels of
the grand seigneurs were obliged t o boil sea-weed
for their daily food. When the White wage-slave is
sick his employer is in no way concerned. When the
poor tottering, wreck of once vigorous manhood is
no longer useful as a sweating-machine for profit,
when he is too- old to work, the alms-house or the
benevolent asylum* receives him. When Nature
at last claims her child, and he dies, he is buried
at the expense of the parish, and the master, the
capitalist who has reaped all the benefits of his
existence; who* has appropriated all the fruits of
his earnings, is enabled thus to shirk all his re-
sponsibility outside the mere working hours—and
even then his responsibility is of the meagrest de-
scription—and to throw it, not upon society, hut
upon the shoulders of the workman himself ; and
the workman’s wife, in constant gratitude, re-
ligiously continues to assist in piling-up profit for
Capital, and in enslaving, by her action, the class
to which she herself belongs. Chattel slavery was
perhaps abolished to give the “ boss ” wider scope
for his operations in the appropriation of the re-
sults of labour. Slavery hangs on the agrarian
question. The possession of land confers owner-
ship of the man who tills it, but who doosn t own
it. It confers also possession on the part of Capi-
tal of the artisan who owns no land, hut who is
forced—because he is human and must eat—to
sell his liberty to the man who controls the source
whence food is to he obtained. Yes, workmen
and their wives continue to bolster-up, and to
assist in the further appropriation of their birth-
right, the people who are their natural enemies.
Henry George in his “ Social Problems” puts
the whole thing in a nutshell. He says :
Chattel slavery is, in fact, merely the rade and primitive
mode of property in man. It only grows up where popula-
tion ia sparse; it never, save by virtue of spscial circum-
stances, continues where the pressure of population gives
land a high value, for in that case the ownership of land
gives all the power that comes from ths ownership of men,
in more convenient form. . . What would the New
England manufacturer gain by the enslavement of his
operatives ! The competition with each other of so-called
freemen, who are denied all right to the soil of what u
called their country, brings him labour cheaper and more
conveniently than would chattel slavery. . . To the
English proprietor, the ownership of slaves would be only a
burden and a less, when he can get labourers for lesi than it
would cost to maintain them as slaves, and when they have
become ill or infirm can turn them on the parish. . . Un-
able to employ themselves, the nominally free labourers are
forced, by their competition with each other, to pay as rent
all their earnings above a bare living, or to sell their labour
for wages which give but a bare living, and ss land-owners
the ex-slave holders are enabled, as before, to appropriate to
themselves the labour, or the produce of the labour, of then-
former chattels, having in the value which this power of
appropriating the proceeds of labour gives to the ownership
of land, a capitalised value equivalent, or more than equiva-
lent, to the value of their slaves. They no longer have to
drive slaves to work j want and the fear of want do that
more effectually than the lash. They no longer have the
trouble of looking out for their employment, or hiriug out
their labour, or the expense of keeping them when they can-
not work. That is thrown upon the slaves. The tribute that
they still wring from labour seems like voluntary payment,
lu fact, they take it as their honest share of the reward of
production—since they furnish the land! and they find so-
called political economists, to sry nothing of so-called
preachers of Christianity, to tell them it is so.
In regard to women —although they cannot be
charged with the onus of the iniquities of the
land system which has grown up during ages of
political sleepiness and cultivated ignorance of
the lower classes—they can he charged with
assisting by want of -thought, by sel-
fishness and a disregard of the best in-
terests of the race, in the perpetuation of
a system the existence of which altogether mili-
tates against and subverts the dearest interests
of Labour. Anti-Chinese leagues, trades-unions,
the maintenance of the principles of the eight
hours’ and rate-of-wage organisations, early-
elosing associations, even Shops and Factories
Bills, anc}. other Acts passed into law for the bene-
fit of Labour, entirely fail to effect aught for
those who endeavour to assist it) ll)eir propaganda
and enforcement, but whose wives surrender
without thought or feeling the principles so often
nobly fought for, and far too often dearly won.
And the whole weight of this indictment recoils
upon the head of the workman. He assumes the
responsibility of looking after his own household,
but it is very frequently the weakest spot in his
line of defence against capital. Women have an
easy tolerance of everything they are accustomed
to, and the workman's wife is not a political
economist, but the man who allows either wife or
daughter to help in pulling down what he is en-
deavouring to build up, deserves neither pity nor
assistance: if his cause ultimately fails and he
succumbs to his ever-watchful enemy, Capital, he
has only himself to thank for it.
Political Chaos.
The curse of personal politics rests heavily on
New South Wales. Neither of the parties which
make up the bulk of the Assembly has any de-
fined platform apart from the questions of Free-
trade and Protection, and there is no organisation
which is capable of laying down a comprehensive
policy for the guidance of electors. The platfo m
of the Freetraders is simply whatever Parkes
wants, and that of the Protectionists is mainly
what Parkes doesn’t want. Apart from Parkes,
the distinction between the two great sections
rests on the fiscal question only, and until Parkes,
after much hesitation, declared for Freetrade, just
previous to the last general election, the Assembly
had no semblance of party lines whatever. On
such questions as land-nationalisation, payment
of members. Chinese immigration, and the like,
the two sides of the House are inextricably
mixed. No one apparently sees anything beyond
the exigencies of the hour, and it is impossible to
forecast the fate of any proposed reform, because
it generally happens that Parkes himself, being
committed to nothing, and being compelled to
form his shifting opinions as lie goes along, is
actuated by the bile of the moment, and forces his
servile followers to vote against their inclinations
under the threat of abandoning fils position,
and leaving the Freetrade party in the lurch,
while his opponents, being also held together by
the tariff question only, are equally unreliable on
all other matters. The Freetrade party are forced
to father the Dead-House, and to say nothing
nasty about the land-resumption jobs and the
atrocious muddlemont of the Public Works Bill,
and a hundred other things, simply because they
were returned upon no well-defined political plat-
form and because the party ticket was left to be
constructed by Parkes after he had assumed
power, and the result is a constant system of ofO-
man tfCWefhlnteht, •which' is harefly one remove
from despotism'. But the present one-man Ad-
ministration* is* already in its second* childhood,
and, in view of its closely - upptokching fall, it is
time for the Democratic party in New South
Wales to prepare a definite programme to place
before the country,
* * *
Protection to native industry, land nationalisa-
tion, the utter expulsion of the infected Mon-
golian, payment of Parliamentary representatives,
the Upper House question, financial economy, the
freedom and unity of Australia; and the abolition
of sectarian strifes in their relation to politics are
principles. which, if put forward by a well-
organised Democratic party, would, ai the next
election, go far to sweep away the dynasty of
fossils who have so long snarled over the bones
of the national carcase for their own
profit and the country’s loss. Bet if New
South Wales is ever to ba governed by a'
national party instead of by an aggregation of
atoms held together only by the bonds of personal
interest, the party must be formed on a broad
basis, and its candidates must be prepared to
accept the programme in every detail. At the
late contest at Newtown, the badly-organised
Nationalists lost the day because, as usual, they
had no representative who was prepared to advo-
cate a thoroughly national policy in lieu of
Foreign Trade bribery and'jobbery, and the re-
presentative was not forthcoming because the
policy was never formulated. Mr. Smith appeared
as an advocate of Protection, but he indignantly*
declined to support the principle of payment of
members, and the working classes, the true
Democracy of the country, were well aware that
they would never be fairly represented so long as
it was necessary either to elect rich capitalists to
guard the interests of the landless multitude, or
else to entrust them to the care of adventurers'
who live by political corruption, as many New
South Wales legislators without any visible means
of support now do. Further, the feeble Protec-
tionist candidate allowed himself to ba led away
into sectarian discussions by the loud-mouthed
bigotry of his opponents, and by openly re-
pudiating the support of all Catholics and
Freethinkers, he went out cf his way to
insult a large section of the community and
subordinated the interests of the country to
the miserable jealousy of dogmatists and the
slavery of creeds. No doubt he allowed himself
to be goaded into this declaration by the oft-
repeated lie that Protection and Romanism go
hand-in-hand, but the Australian Democratic
party has no more to do with the strife of warring
sects than it has with the campaigns of the
Moslems against the men who worship log-imagis
in the wilds of Central Africa, Australia recog-
nises no State Church, and if the Church is to he
used as a weapon to coerce the State the tima will
ultimately come when the Chinese will be pro-
tected in order that Joss may be a factor in politics,
and when Mumbo-Jumbo may hold the balance
in an Assembly of alleged Christians who hive
gone back upon their Gon.
Until an Australian Democratic party comas
into existence it is hopeless to look for any ap-
preciable improvement in political life, Men of
character shrink from entering the chaos which
passes muster as a Legislature, where parties and
principles, or rather want of principle, are mixed
up in inextricable confusion, and where reform is
impossible because men are return'd—not
to support definite measures, but to vote
for the ignorant fetich of the hour and fqr tin.
single item of policy which serves him for a rally-
ing cry. The masses ceaselessly demand reform,
but in a land where nobody owns anything which
can, even by the utmost stretch of courtesy, be
termed a policy, they are merely groping in the
dark, and reaching after something which is as
impalpable as air. Everywhere the tendency is
towards disintegration, and the Protectionist
party, which, in its opposition to the monopoly of
the huge importing firms of Sydney, and its advo-
cacy of the claims of the Australian workman as
against the cheap English, German, or Chinese
artisan, possesses the only claim to represent the
Democratic element of the community, is permit-
ting itself to be gradually split asunder by miser-
able treachery. Mr. John Norton, long known
as a staunch adherent of the Protectionist
policy, now holds a billet on the staff of the
Freetrade Evening News, and is permitted by
that journal to spend his time in de-
livering eloquent lectures throughout the
country, in which he advocates Protection. but
does his best to scatter the seeds Of disunion
among the Protectionist party, and spreads abroad
the hollow lie. first started by the News and by
the Sydney D.T., that Protection is run in the in-
terests of the brewers of Sydney. This thin pre-
tence was originally invented because the National
party resisted the action of a sham Freetrade
Government in heaping taxation on the loca
brewing industry in order to lighten the harden
on their English competitors, and in making
colonial beer dear that imported English beer
might be cheap, and when a deluded Protec-
tionist is hired to spread the empty falsehood
abroad, the Freetrade journal which employs him
emphasises its transparent treachery by publish
ing his utterances under such headings as “ Pro-
tectionist Rout,” “ Division in the Camp," and
the like. Further, Mr. Norton endeavours to lay
on the Protectionists of New South Wales the
burden of Imperialism, and charges them with
supporting the policy which is fathered by the
Freetrade leader—the Pahkes who sold himself
politically for a title, and who staked Ills billet on
the Naval Defence grovel, and which finds its
most eloquent supporter in the Freetrade Dal£ey ;
the same policy which, in Victoria, is ran by
Freetrade Gillies, who sinks his principles that
he may lead a Protectionist Government; and
which, in Queensland, is propped up by Griffith,


Who was always a Freetrader until a few months
ago; when he found it necessary to turn his coat
in the hope of dishing the life-long Protectionist,
MTlwraith. He even endeavours to represent
the party which ho pretends to support as
the hereditary friends of the Chinese, and
ignores the fact that the real friends of the
Chinese are those who keep the porta of New
South Wales open to receive the cheap goods
produced by a country where wages average less
than live shillings a week ; and having thus
loaded upon those he calls his friends all the sins
of their antagonists, Mr. Norton has ably ful-
filled his mission as the Protectionist representa-
tive of the meanest and most unscrupulous Free-
trade journal in New South Wales. The policy
which he advocates is practically the same as that
which is sketched in this article, and which has
been sketched out by The Bulletin a hundred
times before, but ids Democratic programme
merely serves as an instrument for creating dis-
union in the only party which possesses even the
elements of a Democratic policy. And the man-
ner of Mr. Norton’s utterances makes them trebly
suspicious. He was invited as a pretended Pro-
tectionist to address an anti-Chinese meeting held
by the Protectionist party, and he availed himself
of the opportunity to make aflerce attack on his own
cause, while the only allusion ho made to the sub-
ject under discussion was embodied in the menda-
cious assertion that his friends weie the natural
allies of the yellow aliens whose very existence in
the country is based on tire policy of Freetrade.
The Freetrade papers thereupon gleefully
hailed him as a traitor and a deserter,
and published his utterances as a direct
blow to the National cause. The Evening News,
Which has hitherto dismissed Protectionist meetings
with a paragraph of coarse and ignorant jibes,
devoted several columns to the utterances of its
hired servant, and almost entirely suppressed the
speeches of the leaders of Protection ; the Sydney
D.T. followed suit; and as both papers published
t wice as much as Mr, Norton really said, and
published it long before it could have reached
them in the ordinary course, the only possible
conclusion is that these journals were supplied by
Mr, Norton himself with advance copies of his
oration. The Protectionist who hankers so much
after advertisements in the Freetrade Press is a
dubious ally, and John Norton’s debut as the
apostle of chaos has brought his reputation for
political sincerity very low.
Socialism and the Sydney Press.
The Sydney daily Press—and this will apply in a
greater or less degree to the entire daily Press of
Australasia —is one of the most time• serving insti-
tutions of the kind in the world. One section of
it is noted for its blind advocacy of the crusty old
traditions of Imperialism and property and the
crass obstinacy of its Tory mulishness. A second
division is characterised only by a circulation,
built up by pandering to the pruriency of a
hysterical clientele, while a third is famed for the
golden opportunism with which it has tacked
about on various political courses. The last-
mentioned miscalls itself Democratic, which ad-
jective it endeavours to make good by hastening
to sanctify, with its oily smile of approval,
reforms already attained, and in advoca-
ting also far-away reforms which are not
likely to be accomplished within the experi-
ence of at least three generations. All
these pipers, however, meet on common ground,
agreed with wondrous unanimity to block
any immediate or radical remedy intended
to ameliorate the present condition of humanity.
Precipitation and undue haste are its aggregate
bugbear. Its ignorance, to quote the famous
phrase of the hedge-schoolmaster, is indeed pro-
found in its superficiality. The bogie of its dreams
is Socialism. While mumbling with infinite gusto
the names of great scientists, such as Spencer,
Haeckel, or Darwin, it utterly refuse i to receive
Iheir teachings, and, in fact, it has the vaguest
ideas as to whither those teachings tend.
The Sydney D.T., the organ of Opportunism, and
the advocate of the agea-distant reform, under
the head of “Topics of the Day,” made, m a
recent issue, a fierce onslaught upon the logical
outcome of the present Democratic movement,
the mouthpiece of which in Australia it professes
to be. It puts up a plaintive wail because
The Chicago branch of that magnificent body, the Knights
of Labour, has been completely brought under the control
of the Socialists. t
What, after all, is Socialism but a workman s
“ ism.” It certainly is a cause that looks not to
Capital for its advancement. As Aveling puts
it : -
It would be foolish and more on our part to deny that the
nhrase " Worki og-elats Question in America is to us in the
main synonymous with the phrase " Socialism in America.
We believe that Socialism explains why there is, and always
must be, a “ working-class question' until that question is
solved by the historic, evolutionary, and revolutionary
method that Socialism alone points out as inevitable.
* * *
Let the of Australia note well that
i is an alleged Democratic organ that utters
weird “warnings” anent the alarm felt at the
growth of Labour-Socialism by the wealthy and
well-fed, but “ genuine yes, genuine well-
wishers ” of the ungrateful proletarian. You
miserable fry,” says the D.T., in effect, why are
you not contented to work hard and be always
underpaid ? We are happy and healthy, why
aren’t you ? We will do the cultured-existence
business for you ; what do you want with
amelioration of your lot ? Go and toil hard and
keep us in fat dividends, and be thankful that we
allow you the privilege of working
in America, as in Australia, there is always a class of dis-
contented, unscrupulous, self-seeking men, without the man-
liness to work, and without the capacity to make an honest
living, who seek to prey upon the grievances of the working-
class. .
This is true! There are, also, which the D.T.
neglects to mention, always noble, high-minded,
and fearless men who will count their own lives
as nothing when weighed in the balance against
the total good of the race. It is undoubtedly a fact
that the Chicago Anarchists who were recently
hanged were men of this type. It is true that they
wore certainly hot-headed and and
strove to bring about a change in the existing
order of things by means which we should con-
demn even were they employed by so disinterested
a Democratic organ as the Sydney D.T. The
Chicago Anarchists sought to make men better by
advocating the use of reactionary and indivi-
dualistic—not Socialist!®-methods, therefore they
are the worst foes of progress. Nevertheless, the
fact remains that there was not one among them
who was not a capable and intelligent workman,
whom not want, but sympathy, had driven into
the ranks of drastic reform ; and sympathy of the
noblest sort at that; sympathy with struggling,
down-trodden and enslaved humanity. They all
earned more than sufficient for the support of
themselves and their families, and Louts Lingo,
the man who blew his own head off rather than
allow the hangman to fix the noose around his
neck, was noted for being a clever and particularly
prosperous workman.
* * *
The D.T. goes on to say :
They become stump orators, agitators, ele n tion-mongers,
democrats (?), Socialists, or anything that gives them an
excuse for fulminating against society and the country s in-
stitutions, and enables them to live comfortably upon the
support of men who are deluded into working to keep these
schemers talkiug.
In the above catalogue we notice the word “demo-
crats.” The 1).T., in moments of advertised self-
interest, claims to be the organ of 'democrats’
in Australia. Is this, in its own language, “to
afford it an excuse for fulminating against society
and the country's institutions,” to enable it to
“ live comfortably upon the support of men who
are deluded into working” to keep this “ schemer”
talking ? It is certainly true that persons of the
class enumerated so minutely by the D.T. are
brought to the front, but in the words of Chief
Justice Cockburn
Demagogues are almost always effects—rarely causes.
They are the froth that rises and bubbles on the surface
when the mass of the people ferments.
* * *
The “frothy demagogue" never ouWingers the
occasion of his existence. He dies with the wave
that engulpha the stately ship of society—but so
does the ship! When the blatant soi disant
organ of the Australian Democracy goes on to the
statement that follows, it brings down upon its
head a whole avalanche of counter-statement and
retributive fact. It says :
The frothy demagogue cannot get among them—the
workmen —until he becomes a worker, and that virtually
means excluding him for life.
The appalling ignorance of such a remark is im-
mediately apparent when we remember that in
the ranks of avowed Socialists we have had such
splendid names as Proudhon, Louis Blanc,
Michelet, Armand Babbes, Saint Simon,
Fourier, Blanqui, Eugene Sue, and Victor
Hugo, in France; Karl Marx, Friedrich
Engels, Lassalle, and Jacob r, in Germany ;
Herzen and Bakunin, in Russia; Mazzini and
Garibaldi, in Italy: Robert Owen, in Eng-
land ; and Nathaniel Hawthorne, in America;
that amongst the present Socialist leaders are
such men as Hyndman, a man of property who
gave his fortune to the cause; William Mor-
ris, the poet and a cultivated man of letters ;
Burns, the Christian Communist, and many
Others in England ; Elisee Rkclus—acknow-
ledged to be the greatest geographer of this
century—in France ; Damala Niewenhuys, in
Holland; C/ksak de Paepe, in Belgium; Prince
Krapotkine and Stepniak, and many other
noted chiefs in Russia; and Hasenclever,
Bebel, and Liebkneciit, in Germany. These
were and are all avowed Socialists. There are
dozens of others, who, although they did not cast
in their lot with Socialism, taught it in their lives,
their public and private utterances, their actions
and their writings. Of these Heine, Gogol J.
S. Mill, Freiligrath, George Eliot, Lermon-
toff, Dostoieffsky, Tolstoi, Tubgenikff,
and dozens of other names will be instantly sug-
gested to the intelligent reader whose information
ii gained from sources other than the D.T. In
fact, literature is laden with Socialism. Down
the stream of time the heavy-freighted galleon
conies, rich with the thought of a Plato, a
Lycurgus, a Sir Thomas More, a Bacon, a
Campanhlla. Such writers as George Sand, or
Swinburne in his days of sanity, Byron,
Shelley ; nay, even Shakespeare and Goethe
and Dante, are tiue and genuine Socialists at
heart and in the inner core, and they live and
breathe in the minds of men as they do because
their works throb with love for human-kind, and
they speak with their wide-sounding voices to all
men and all times. What lives of Dr. Johnson
and the like fine old Tories, is not the narrow,
petty, bigoted spirit of their day and generation,
but the words written when they forgot that they
were partisans, and let slip great words of hope
which unconsciously proclaimed them men and
Socialists.
To return to the D.T. It concludes its intem-
perate and illogical tirade with an assertion
respecting Socialistic demagogues that —
Occasionally these men glide on their tongues into Parlia-
ment} but whether they remain in or out of the Legi.s ature
they seem to make a comfortable living without taking their
coats off or hardening their hands.
We ask is this confined to men professing only
one set of political opinions ? Is this not true of
men who have grown gray in the public service
and on the public pay, and who lift their voices
only when Labour is to be given a stone when it
asks for bread ? Has not there been an instance of
rank old Imperialistic Dodges maintaining power
and place without taking off coat or hardening
of hands ? Has no Premier made a profession of
politics whose vote was pledged in advance against
Labour ? Whose dearest friends were the Chinese
robbers of the workman’s loaf, and whose insol-
vency schedules were the despair and admiration
of hundreds of men who were compelled to work,
but who would like to fare sumptuously and wag
a head over lordly feasts, indifferent to the dis-
traints of a perennial bailiff? While the D.T.
continues to hold a brief for the discredited
Parkes, who lives in a particularly vulnerable
glass-house, it should be careful lest, whilst taking
a pot-shot at a Socialist, it peradventure hit a
Premier under the fifth rib, and wound him in his
political pericardium !
PLAIN ENGLISH.
University Women.
The Senate of the University of Cambridge has
declined to recommend that the degrees of the
University be conferred on women, and in the in-
terests of feminity we say a very good job, too! The
race is deteriorating fast enough in all conscience.
The men are getting worse and worse. Physically,
men are going down, down, down. The white-
faced wretches that totter about cities with their
thin flanks and their flaccid muscles, their weary
washed-out, frail bodies, their bright, restless eyes,
their hot, feverish hands, and their over-strung
nervous organisations are bad enough. If it were
not that a few strong women are left to redeem
the race, God help the children I Of course, the
men who go to the universities do not hurt them-
selves. Most men go, in England at least, as a
mere matter of form, and the act is regarded as a
necessary one to men moving in a certain position
in life. A man can easily read up and struggle
through without a great amount of effort, and if
he docs not get through there is very little harm
done. Again, few men go to the university, as a
matter of dire necessity, to pass examinations with
honours, and these few belong to a class whose
studies would make a big drain upon them in any
case. With the average Englishman university
life is a simple social duty—a farce as
far as study is concerned —in which an
athletic young fellow with a moderate amount
of intelligence, reads a respectable number of
hours per diem, and alternates his studies with
cricket and rowing. With woman, however, all
this is different. Very few individuals of the
other sex are built on a sufficiently generous sea e
to relieve mental strain by physical exertion
of a style vigorous enough to maintain the
beautiful equilibrium between mind-culture and
body-culture, and fewer women still go through
I the curriculum as a mere matter of filling up a
few years of their life. The women who go
to the university do so in the face of a
natural prejudice, and this, at the very outset,
throws them out of harmony with their environ-
ment. They are made to feel that their conduct
is eccentric, hence they lead a life of continual
and nervous unhealthy protest against a popular
and academical criticism. The emotional side of
woman's nature being the most developed, a
I course of severe study under the ban of masculine
and feminine disapproval disorganises it stilt
I more. She cannot escape, in vigorous physical
I exercise, from the operation of excessive cerebra-
I tion. Her nerves, naturally move sensitive .than
I man’s, are quickly demoralised. in short,
lif women arc to cultivate the sciences they
I must remain celibates for life. If they intend to
I fulfil their natural functions as wives and mothers
I they must stay as they are and be healthy
I animals.
ITlie Knlghl of Labour ami (In' Knapp.
L’he gentle and much-advertised E. J. H. Knapp,
Jreat Mokanna of New South Wales Social Purity
mdginger-pop, unburdens his soul to a cold and un-
lympathetic world of tipple in a Sydney daily,
Je demands that the cont rol of the liquor-traffic
>e given to the people. Whenever Mr. Knapp
:alks about “the people 1 he means the Local
Dptionists the men who never drink, never
mioke. don't marry, and whose generation of cant
is kept stagnating along in a much-suffering uni-
verse by proselytlsm, for they rarely leave behind
them children virile enough to perpetuate their
aqueous appellations. In his letter. Mr. Knapp in
bewildering fashion mixes up cause and effect
until it is almost impossible to disentangle them.
He demands that the drink question be sett led —
on the side of prohibition -before the relations
between capital and labour are taken into
account, not recognising that the anomolous
position of labour and the unequal distribution of
wealth are considerable factors in the drink ques-
tion. Drinking is the result, not the cause, of
misery. Abolish poverty and the unnatural con-
ditions of artificial society, and you abolish drink.
Men drink because they are compelled to raise the
tone of life ; to alternate from its leaden dullness ;
its oppressive commonplace, if only by plunging
into the fool’s paradise of the drinker. Delirium
is better than the sordid and uneventful existence
of most of ue, although we can quite understand
the Knapp clan we don’t speak personally—
requiring no such stimulus. Then this exas-
perating evangelist of tea-leaves goes on to say
that the American Knights of Labour had taken
a stand not only against the drink-traffic, but
against tobacco-smoking. [Mr, Knapp omits to
mention that the Knights of Labour, according to
the Sydney Freetrade papers, have also declared
in favour of the Chicago Anarchists ; in the line,
therefore, of their tendency to abolish every-
thing, they may yet abolish Mr. Knapp.]
Next they will oppose an impregnable front to
umbrellas and’issue* manifestoes against the use
of soap. The Knight of Labour, who pursues
the course indicated by the Knapp, is a roaring
lunatic. Lister, O, Knight of Labour ! If you
want to keep up your wages, you must beep up
the number of your absolute necessities. Wages
have an inevitable tendency, as Mr. Freetrade
Knapp will tell you, to dim nish until they reach
the bare subsistence point. Do not cut your bare
subsistence po’nt too fine. If you can work with-
out using beer cr tobacco, look out 1 The ” boss
will hear of it and your " screw ” will suffer a re-
duction equivalent to the price of the beer and
tobacco which it is found you can dp without.
The countries where labour is cheapest are those
in which, on account of climatic conditions and
the small cost of a fruit diet, the labourer has the
fewest wants. When, O, Knight of Labour,
you can do without food, tr clothes, or sleep ~
when you no longer desire to marry and bring up
a family, and when your wants are about as easily
compassed as those of the jellj-flsh, you will be
forced to work for nothing—for the jelly-fish
must have a strip of sandy beach to pulse upon in
the sunlight, and your owner has the land you
must live upon, no matter how small jour wants
may be. The evil in the world fluctuates very
little. In a sl ate of nature men killed each other
wi r h a club, and now they do it with joint-stock
swindles and bad grog and colicky gingerbccr. If
men didn’t drink had grog they would possibly do
something worse —die of lemonadic flatulence,
mayhap. A teetotaller has been hanged before to-
day. See what ultimately happened to Mr.
T a well, the pious Sydneyite of 50 years ago, who,
upon being “converted,” esten* a iou sly emptied all
his stock of grog into the Beautiful Harbour !
If strong men who are not teetotallers dis-
I continued drinking they would probably t ake t o
some villainous drog and stupify ttemselves with
chloral, or morphine, or tea. Thera have been tea-
drunkards also, Mr. Knapp, and they don’t lojk
half so inviting as specimens of humanity as the
good old seasoned boozer with a whole life’s
history of t ipple written on his purple proboscis.
It is all a question of kind, not of degree, and
the world is not yet governed absolutely by hydro-
cephalus. /'

The Emperor William of Germany.
This is the period of governmental grief, when
departments don their suits of sable; officials
creep about darkened corridors dripping a tear
corresponding in size and density with the rank of
the departed, and bureaucracy sits down to weep
with a due regard for the demands commercial
relations make upon sympathy and with aU the
decent decorum of international woe. This lip-
wailing and documentary regret is a tribute to
the armed strength of Germany and a mark of
respect to Germany’s real ruler, Bismarck, the
Teuton Warwick and king maker of tbis century.
To the old man, who lies as low as any of his foes
or his subjects shot down in his various wars of
dynastic ambition, little thought is gB en. Ue is
a name only, save to the poor creatures who, in
the abyss of their own self-abasement, worship
everything which occupies a regal pedestal. To
such it would matter little if the Emperor Wil-
liam of Germany paralleled the late royal maniac
who ruled Bavaria. They worship Regality, not
lauhood, William, the late ruler of the Teutonic
nifederacy, was not a hero. He had not the
:cuse of a Napoleon in h’s wars of ambition; ho
as not a genius. He was simply a sslf-sa'isflcd,
ligious soldier of the prpnouncsdly bourgeois
p?, part Methodist, part rake. Had he not
sen born to the purple he would have made a
Jry good corporal or drill-sergeant. He was a
iarty feeder, a strict disciplinarian both of his
■my and his family when he was not drill-
g soldiers he was ogling the angels of the
diet. His life was passed on the battle-
did, on the parade-ground, in the dining-hall, and
the green-room. He was a glorious example
I the faith as it is in Constantine. ‘‘ By this
gn we conquer !” was the motto of his common-
ace life, and the cross of Christ was carried in
ie van of his army as the gonfanon of Im-
nialism. From Gravelotte’s crimson held he
rote, with snuffling hypocrisy, to his wife
UGUSTA putting up thanksgiving to the Goo of
attles for a victory, while the corpses of 39,000
sad scented the air around him. He had none of
ie semi-divine madness of the man born with a
sinus for slaughter. His was the case-hardened
Piousness of the butcher, who steps into the
iambics with indifference and quits it when he
i too tired to slay longer, and who goes homo to
itt with a laugh on his lips, and thanks the good
athcr ,that he was able to do so much work in
ne day. William was not a hero. Ho was
Imply a facile instrument of a far-reaching brain;
e was the embodiment of a policy—the uniflea -
ion of Germany ; his master found in the iinques-
Loning drill-sergeant, gross feeder and deep
rinker, religious fanatic of the cheese-and-bacon
vpo and ballet-girl gallant - the machine for his
urpose. With anyone else the establishment of
’russia at the head of the Teutonic Confederacy
tight have been impossible, but as Napoleon
ad his Lucien, his Talleyrand, or Fouchb, so
,ad Bismarck his William, Emperor of Ger-
aaliy, and through his man of straw he
ulcd and intrigued and warred and cou-
riered. The Kaiser was really but Otto’s
igure-head field-marshal, and as such wo let
dm pass to the proud Imperial throne resowed for
dm in Heaven. He was a good exponent of the
roatuie called Christianity, the negation of the
aith as it is in the Saviour it ever denies ; but he
vas as much a blind and nnconsc’ous instrument
n the hands of superior intelligence as the knife
yith which the butcher kills his victim. If the
ild faith which stared men’s heart? and guided
heir actions were a reality and not an outworn
nyth, then might we commiserate the gray-
mired man of blood, the creature of the man of
ron, on his way to,his judgment. But we know
it is not so. Murders in the name of Christ are
rewarded with jewelled crowns and celestial dis-
tinctions. Yet into our memory, spite of the
logic, comes a stanza of J. R. Lowell’s on the
peace at the conclusion of the American Civil
War, and, somehow, it seems to fit the aged
Teuton slaughterer u ore aptly than the Southern
President :
My eyes cloud up for rain ; my mouth
Will take to twitchin' rouu' the corners :
I pity mothers, tu, down South,
For all they sot among the soorners
I d sooner take my chance to stan'
At Jedgmeut where your meanest ala re is.
Than at God’s bar hot up a han‘
Ez drippin’ red ez your'n, Jeff Davis !

The (Jrog Service.
Jambs Service, of Melbourne, is well-known in
the character of a Foreign-trader and in other
roles which need not here be particularised, but it
is quite a novel y to sec him figuring in public as
a moralist. Perhaps the religious example of
Service peer, who, years ago, used to preach to
benighted lumpers and abandoned seamen on the
Melbourne wharves, has at last had some good
effect upon the ex Premier of Victoria. Or can
it be that association with the great and good
Graham Berry in the last Administration las
effected a moral revolution in the character of
Mr. Service ? The ether day a man applied to
the Melbourne Licensing Court for a license
for a public-house which he proposed to
build at Balaclava, a fashionable suburb of
the Southern capital. Now, mark you,
James Service and Co., of Collins-street West,
. sell oceans of grog wholesale every year, but it's
no concern of the senior partner in the firm what
the ultimate destination of his “Long John”
and Res! Jamaica may be, or how much the
shanties to which it is consigned may promote in-
temperance, so long ,as pubs, keep a respectful
distance from Service Hall at Balaclava, and the
cabmen whom he employs when he doesn’t want
to trot out his own barouche and pa ! r, are not
taught to be tipplers. So James appeared before
the Licensing Court and objected to the license
for this propo.el house at Balaclava being granto J
on the grounds that “the house was net re-
quired, and if the license were granted it
would have the effect of making the drivers
of cabs on the rank opposite the proposed site
intemperate and a nuisance to persons living
in the neighbourhood." Virtuous and considerate
Service ! For 31 years past, James Serv ice has
been selling grog for consumption on Collingwood
Flat, for example, whore shoals of cabmen not
I only stand on the rank, but live and drink and
swear, and sometimes beat their wives and punch
their neighbours' heads, but Service, in his far-
off suburban retreat among the mansions of Bala-
clava; wot not of these things, and quaffed iris
goed sack and sparkling Roselle free from the din
of the vulgar bar and the loathsome language of
inebriated cabmen. Trade in grog is all. well
enough, and Service doesn’t mind piling up
a colossal fortune by it —but, then, the
ultimate vulgar effects of it on cab-drivers
and the rest of the lower orders must
not be brought right home to his door
at Balaclava. Let the' “ jaws of death " and the
“ mouth of Hell ’ in the shape of low public-
houses be opened, wherever you choose, and
James will be willing to pour liquor into them in
abundance —terms, cash monthly—bub pray keep
far aloof from Mr. Service and his pet jarvies.
'This paternal anxiety of James for the “ cab-
drivera on the rank ” who might be tempted some-
times to take too many long beers and use bad
language towards each other is truly touching.
When Service was a candidate for the represen-
tation of Collingwood in the Assembly some time
since, and was defeated, he didn't exhibit
enormous interest in . the moral welfare of the
hundreds of cabbies who hang out there, nor did
he show any strong disposition to crush the strug-
gling publican. But what’s tolerable or even
blameless on the banka of Reilly's Drain may be
hideous and immoral down by the sea at Elstem-
wdek and Balaclava, This latest development
of the Serviccan policy is only one more ex-
emplification of the doctrine of Self, which is so
eminently characteristic of Foreign-traders where-
ever they are to be found in Australia. Mr. Ser-
vice doesn’t believe in Freetrade in liquor if it's
likely to affect himself unpleasantly, but goes in
with all his soul for'Protection when the thing to
be protected is James Service, Esq., his personal
peace and domestic happiness rnd the morality of
his particular cabmen.


: c Press and Premier.
Mr. Watkin, the Protectionist; candidate for
Central Cumberland, is a big shareholder in the
alleged freetraie Sydney Daily Telegraph ;
Mr. Nobbs, his freetrade opponent, is not a share-
holder in the paper pledged to support the fiscal
policy Mr. Nobbs claims to represent. Hence the
D.T., with magaifhent self denial and self-si uni-
fication, supports in the following editorial tte
candidature of its shareholder at tho expense of
Its alleged principles, and the man who comes
forward to advocate the cause of the D.T. is
slighted and damned with faint political praise of
a peculiarly sardonic kind : -
Protection apart, Mr. Watkin is jest the type of man
wh.ch would always do honour to the Parliament cf a pro-
gressive dear cratic community. He has a reputation to
pledge, and >me which no political gain would compensate
him for if forfeited. In the hands of men like this repre-
sentative functions are clways safe from abuse
Active, energetic, straight-going, clean-iifed citizenship will
tall, and it would be a sorry day for the community if'such
were not the case Mr. N< bbi is a man of keen
wit, strong, practical mind and s uod reputation Ha has
been prominently identified with the industrial progress of
Central Cumberland, and the number cf times tfiat he has
been elected Mayor of one of its most important munici-
palities »iihout opposition sho v a tfiat in so far as he has
been publicly tried he has not been found wanting. B( th
Freetrade and Protection, then fore, will be worthily repre-
sented, and a fair and honest conti st may ba loosed for at
the poll.
Now, the foregoing is plain enough. Ic is running
with the hare and hunting with the hounds with
a vengeance. Parties, however, who is not a
shareholder in the D T., considered this praise of
a fiscal foe ‘‘singularly inopportune,” and hastened
to Liverpool to mitigate its presumably fa al
effect. He took Abigail with him, and the latter
statesman persuaded the fruitgrowers of Cumber-
land that the golden spheres ovei’ a pawnbroker's
sign were the fruit of the orange gleaming in the
“ sunlight of this free bright land of ours.”
PARKES, with characteristic eloquence, said of
Mr. Watkin, the Protectionist candidate, tte
shareholder and protege of the Sydney D.T. :
If you want to add to the ignorance of the Assembly—if
you want to add to the untmthfulness of the Assembly— if you
want to add to the obstruction in the Assembly—if you want
to add to the blackguardism in the Assembly—then elect Mr.
onus’"'opponent. (Cheers.) lam sorry to have to speak of
Mr. Watkin, because I cannot but speak of him in thssi
terms.
Parkes here puts a distinct issue before the
in connection with this elt cticn : Elect
Nobbs and abolish legislative blackguardism. The
D.T. said that in Mr. Watkins hancs “repre-
sentative functions” would be “ always safe from
abuse.” But mark! Immediately after making
this wholesale indictment against Mr. Watkin,
Sir Henry charged him with telling “a down-
right He.” The D.T.’s “only” statesman once
told us what honour did not consist In doing. His
speech at Liverpool must be read as showing
what “ blackguardism” does not consist in saying.
He called Mr, Watkin “a stagnant man—a
toadstool—a man who casts an unhealthy
shadow ; ” he described opponents to his policy as
“native dogs and opossums” and “inferior
animals; ” sensible questions he referred to as
“Idiotic yells he told an interject:r to “shut
up ” and to “ go out and bark with the dogs out-
side ; ” protectionists were individuals of a sort
that wanted “washing cr hanging”—“soap for
the dirty men and ropa far the villainous men ”
an interlocutor was a “wretched person” who
hid “ hiis ugly face," and ha would rather have
“Chinamen than soma of the people at the other
end of the room.” This is not b’ackguardism ; it
Is only a reproduction of Ah Haynes, from whom
Parkes has taken another leaf or two. The
D.T.’s “ only” statesman is afraid to go to the
country on the Freetrade versus Protection issue,
and he does nob care to state that the true issue
upon which he will always fight is the Orange
versus Green; so, copying the Escaped Ah
Mudgee, he bold the Liverpool electors that Free-
trade and Protection were of very small matter in
this contest:
The real questions at stake in th<s contest are to a large
extent concealed from you, and I don't hesitate to say that
under this specious cry cf protection there are persons at
work who, if they could, certainly would destroy your public
instruction system.
This is a direct attempt to resurrect the Kiama
Ghost and excite sectarian in'olerance. Then he
tried to bribe the Liverpool electors. Nobbs was
instrumental in effecting the transference of the
polling booth from Liverpool to Granville. Parkes
guaranteed to reverse this if they supported the
man who had wrought them this injury. The
S.M. Herald gave of this precious address
only about a quarter of a column. The Herald
is nob anxious to further discredit Parkes with
the country just yet. The D. T., however, desirous
to crush Parkes in order to secure the election of
its shareholder—Mr. Watkin, the Protectionist
candidate —publishes the speech in extenso, devo
ting three columns to the woik of mining
Parkes’ reputation thronghonb the colony. After
the publication of Parkes’ Central Cumberland
Blllingsgatoration it Is safe to prophesy—nothing.
The Boyal Silver Wedding.
Of all debasing conceptions about the most debas-
ing possible is the presentation of gifts to that un-
happy woman the woild koows as the Princess
of W ales on her silver-wedding with the debauchee
she still calls husband. Her married life has
been one long tale of misery, the results of deeds
Of brazen-faced neglect which have rendered her
position one of intolerable isolation, and the— let u s
be charitable —moral effect of which has so
wrecked her constitution as to mat e her the pity
of all England and the world. Of a sweet and
gentle disposition, but without a single gift of
personal power or intellect, the Princess of V ales
has suffered for 25 years neglect and insult such
as it is not the lot of any ordinary woman of
spirit to put up with for a week. From the days
Of Lady Mordaunt up to those of the contem-
porary ballet-girls of the Empire Theatre and the
brutal wife-beating cocktail-bruiser, John Sul-
livan, the Prince of Wales has admittedly been
the associate of men and women whose coarse-
grained immorality was as notorious as it
was abominable. The Princess is prematurely
old, bald and deaf and halting, and it is just
an unspeakable mockery to celebrate that
wretched act, which has stricken her body and
soul, wrecked her health and her happiness, and
left her the pitiful shadow of that proud and
lovely girl whose advent in England was cele-
brated by the deathless verse of a deathless poet.
But the truth is, that the whole thing is a filthy
political move, intended to try once mrre to palm
off on the public the idea of a “ domestic ” Heir-
Apparent, and Lady Holland’s pestering letters
to Lady Carington, Lady Loch, Lady Mus-
grave, etc., are merely quack Imperialistic adver-
tisements. But, surely, when even the “stupid
papers” all over Australia, from Holy Adelaide to
Broiling Brisbane, are forced to unite in pointing
out the political aim of the wretch d device,
and apologising for the snobbery which makes it
possible—surely even Australian Vice-royalty
might throw up the sponge. It Is too thin.
HISTORY OF BOTANY BAY.
“ On the 4fch of January, 1810,’' says Holb
In his memoirs, “ three ships hove In sight of
Sydney—the Dromedary, the Indostan, and a store-
ship—which came up to the Cove with every pre-
paragon to g.ve a broadside it they saw occasion.”
This meant that Governor Macquarie had arrived,
with a detachment of the 73rd Regiment. The
new Governor expected that he and his battalion
would have to fight their way, and put down the
insurrection by fores; but this was merely an idle
fancy of Major-General Lachlan Macquarie’s In-
noesnt mind. The men he had to deal with were
not given to fighting. They knew how to skulk
out of their difficulty by a much easier process
than that.
On the morning of the fiixffi, the troops
began to disembark, and the New South Weiss
Corps was promptly on hand, in a burst of effusive
loyalty, to salute the King’s representative. The
new comers marched on to the parade ground, and
there the new Judge-Advocate, Efiis Beat, read
the com i ies'.on t f Macquarie and his lieutenant,
Richard ChailesO ConmD.iittepresencetf all the
soldier,, and inhabitants. The 73rd then marched
out of the town, and pitched their tents a mile
and-a-half away irom the barracks, placingpicquets
and taking all the precautions usual to a brigade
on active service in the field. All this was vie wed
with the g eatest peiturb,t on by those who had
been active ia the rebellion. Mazarthur and
Johnstone had taken every care to get away out
of danger long before, and were by this time in
England slandering Bligb.
But the officers and men of the Corpn saw
a 7 once that their day was over. They waited
anxiously for Macquarie to break his ominous
silence, and put them out tf their misery of doub\
When it became known that the Corps was ordered
home, the first sensation was one of profound
relief. This was succeeded by the reflection that
all their merry days at Botany Bay, with its petty
tyramres and its privileged ruffianism and its
rum, were over, and that return to England
meant going back to the old life once more.
“The old soldiers, with their wives and children,
were full of lamentations that evening ; for they
saw that they must quit New South Wales, and
they knew that it was a very different thing living
there and living in England.” However, Mac-
quarie allowed some few of the old soldiers to
enlist in the 73rd. The rest were packed off
in the first ships. It will be remembered that
ttre Co;pt was or iginally recruited from the prisons
and the hulks, and, as Hunter wrote, by emisttng
“ characters who had been disgraceful to every
other regiment in his Majesty’s service.” Men
who had been condemned to service in India were
reprieved, as we before mentioned, to enlist in the
New South Wales Corps. Their csreer at Botany
Bay did not improve them, apparently, for very
soon after their return to England they found
their native level. They were constituted a
‘ condemned regiment ’ themselves, drammed
out of ths country, and sent to spend the rest of
their existenca where the hopeless outcasts of the
military service were sent—to India. They were
good enough to conduct a philanthropio experi-
ment and found a new British colony, bub they
were not good enough to remain a regiment in the
regular service at home.

And so the New South Walts Corps
rattles its drums in the town of Sydney for the
last time, and drops finally out of our story. In
the whole range of human history it wou’d be
hard to select even one solitary passage that, for
dismal misery, cruelty, and squalor, could even
distantly compare with what has been here
touched with a very hesitating pen. To draw the
curtain entirely aside from the squalid abomina-
tions of these first years of our story would be to
disclose a picture of horror that is simply revolt-
ing and nothing more. Enough has been said for
the purpose of the present writer, and more than
enough to show what the beginnings of the colony
really were. The subject is nob an attractive one.
Not one word would have been said to revive this
squalid and debasing memory were it not that the
shameful brand of this “rum-selling Corps” still
reddens and burns In the flesh of Young Australia.
» * *
With the exit of the “ rutn-seliing corps ”
a new volume in the history of Botany Bay may
be said to open. But it is sal to have to add that
enough of the old leaves remained to make the
new book, in many respects, a copy of the old. Had
the Corps canticued its rule, it is quite impossible
to imagine what the colony would have eventually
become. But when it was drafted home, its
officers, the responsible agents of all the rascality,
resigned almost in a body, and remained behind.
This was their way cut or the difficulties that sur-
rounded them. They had made large fortunes,
and founded large interests during the hep-day of
their power. So they deserted their followers
whom they had first robbed and then led into
danger ; turned their back cn the King’s colours,
aod settled down in the colony to continue their
old practices as far as they might be allowed, to
become nominee legislators eventually and the
fenders of onr first families. The strong rule of
the military Governors who, beginning with M »c-
-quarle, superseded the old naval Governors, did
not allow of the same excesses as the first 20 years
of cur history presented. But the wealth and
influence of these black-leg officers, who deserted
their followers after leading them into danger,
made them powerful enough to recover from the
shoe* and perpetuate the spirit they introduced,
even down to our own days.
“ All the oppressors were smashed to-
gether,” says Holt, “ and it was amusing to hear
them abusing each other and cursing the Gover-
n rs.” And in another place we get this
“Anthony Fenn K’uop lost his commission as
Judge-Advocate, and frem being a magistrate end
a gn at officer in the colony, became nothing more
ihan a captain In the 102nd Regiment," by which
name the Corps was henceforth known. “ And
worse than this," goes on Holt, “his rotten
tobacco would no longer pay the soldiers, so that
misfortunes came upon him In various shapes.”
One of the first acts of Macquarie was to lower
the price of provisions from the false standard to
which the officers had raised it, and to have food
sold in the open market instead of In the hole-and
corner manner they had forced on the settlement.
“ Tnis was of great service to the poor,” we are
told, “ and injured no one but those who could
hear it, and had too long enjoyed an unfair profit.
Comfort and happiness now began to appear in
the countenances of all the iuhabitan’s of
the colony. John Macarthur lost Lis vil-
lainous trade, but it had lasted lorg enough
to enable him to make a large fortune.”
But, then, as we have before had occasion to
notice, John Macarthur was not a man likely to
waste either his substance or his sympathy on
whnt ho called tte “idle, worthless poor."
Another of Macquarie’s earliest steps was
to declare mill aid void all the acta of the o file era’
Government during the time of their rule. Their
grants of land aid free pardons were revoked as
illegal, and the documents conveying such grants
or pardons were called in. Bat Macquarie was a
man of marked tact,, and it was his primary object
to see justice done, as far as possible, so that none
might suffer through the fault cf others, Having
vindicated his authority, therefore, by this act,
he afterwards confirmed most if not all of these
grants and pardons. He had instructions to use
his discretion, in view of the two years that had
elapsed since the rebellion, so that its traces
might be effaced with the least possible friction,
This was fortunate for the individuals, but for the
colony ard its future it was simply the worst
thing that ciuld possibly have happened. Had
strong ard draaMc treasures been adopted firmly
and at once, and me wi etches who had wrought
such m:serj cn the colony been swept away root
and branch, and every trace of their squalid
presence scattered to the wind*, it would have
been Incalculably better for the Australia of
to-day. Macquarie showed to these ruffians a
measure of mercy they lad never been known to
show to others. We ihall see, presently, how
they repaid him.
• * *
Meanwhile, it cannot be overlooked that
a very great reform had been effected in the con-
dition and prospects of the settlement by the very
first steps Macquarie took. Tte departure of the
Corps was an omen of good The drunken Judge-
Advocate who Indirectly caused the rebellion, and
then took service under the officers who opposed
him, was drummed out of Botany Bay with them,
and another Judge-Advocate, who was not
drunken, appointed in his place. A chaplain was
also brought out by Macquarie, and the officer
who solemnised marriages for the settlement
found his occupation gone. A good many of the
harems were broken up, for Macquarie brought
his wife with him, and her presence kept the
moral atmosphere in the neighbourhood of Go-
vernment House and tbs official centres compara-
tive!}' clean and pure. But it was many years
yet be’ore the '‘factory” at Parramatta discon-
tinued to supply wives to the settlers on approval,
to be returned and replaced if found unsuitable.

It was during the second year of Mac-
quarie’s governmtnt that the court-martial on
Colonel Johnston took place. It was held at the
Royal Hospital, Chelsea, and lasted thirteen days,
resulting in Colonel Johnston being found guilty
of the act cf mutiny, and ca shined, It was
added, in a general order of the Commander in-
chief, “ that the court, in passing a sentence so
inadequate to the enormity of the crime of which
the prisoner has been found guilty, have appa-
rently been actuated by a consideration of the
novel and extraordinary circumstances ” sur-
rounding the condition of the colony. The Prince
Regent, in “ admitting the principle under which
the court had allowed this consideration to act in
mitigation of the punishment which the act of
mutiny would otherwise have suggested,” said
that “no circumstances could be received in full
extenuation of an assumption of power, so sub-
versive of every principle of good order and dis-
cipline. as that under which Lieutenant-Colonel
Johnston had been convicted.” An enquiry Into
Macarthur’s share in the proceedings resulted in
hia being prohibited for eight j ears from returning
to the colony. He employed part of the Interval
in a pleasant tour on the continent. Many hun-
dreds of poor wretches had been sent to Botany
Bay for life for much less villanlei than his.
Bligli was immediately promoted to the
rank c f Rear- Admiral in the Navy, and employed
on active service. While the case was in progress,
Johnston made capital of the fact that Bligh had
been involved In such enquiries before, while, to
himself, the position of prosecutor or defendant
was new and painful. There was some truth in
this ; for Johnston, as we have already seen, was
in the habit of shooting and hanging prisoners
without wasting time in prosecuting them.
But Bligh manfully met the charge with a
siilor like and simple account of his career
which compelled the respect of hia hearers and
put the calumnies of the defence to the rout. He
referred to the charge of cowardice; he said he
knew that Mr. Macarthur wrote the despatch, in
which the oircumstancs of his having been found
by the soldiers in hiding under a bed was men-
tioned with vulgar triumph. But he could not
anticipate, he raid, that Colonel Johnston’s
address to the Court would be written in the same
spirit, and that, after being the victim of Mr,
Maoarthur’s intrignes, he wonld allow himself to
be made the tool of his revenge. Then he ex-
plained that just before his arrest he called
for his uniform, which was not a dress
adapted for concealment, and then, selecting
some papers, he was tearlcg soma to pieces
and concealing the remainder when he was
discovered stooping over some documents on the
floor, by the soldiers on the other side of the bed.
Ma’arthur’s ’actios pursued him to the last. Be-
fore the sentence was mads known a false account
of the trial was published in the British Ex-
press, containing severe reflections on Governor
Bligb. A enpy of this, wet from the printing-
office, was posted anonymously to Bligh; and,
says Lang, “on the inside of the envelope there
was sketched the figure of a pistol, inHmating,
doubtless, that the old admiral had now nothing
better to do than to use Jthat instrument effec-
tually, and ba off! ” The sender o’ this was never
known. But it the reader will compare ib with
the anonymous attacks on Governor King, and
with a certain surreptitious document iis:ed by
Macarthur later on, he will see unmistaaable
traces in all three of the one unscrupulous hand.
Only two Freetraders made any stand
against the passing of the N.S.W. Naval Tribute
BiU.
Thirty-one Protectionists and three Free-
traders announce themselves as candidates in the
coming Queensland election.

He : “Going to the opera." She : “Ah! I under-

—twice as many as the ballet-dancers.”
In the British Honse of Commons, Labou-
chere’s motion to abolish (he Lords as an heredi-
tary ruling body was supported by Gladstone,
who forced the so-called “ Unionists,” who have
hitherto been trading on the name of Liberals, to
show their hand. They voted cn masse against the
proposal, ihus proving their sympathies to be with
the Tories, who hold that it is right and proper
that the eldest son of a peer should help to rule
the Empire, even though he be deaf, blind, dumb
diseased, idiotic, paralysed, one eared, and one-
eyed. At next general election not a third of the
Unionists will dare to face Liberal constituencies.

The period of man’s sojourn in this vale of
sorrow Is short and uncertain, and it is still more
uncertain where he will go to when he leaves.
Politicians, emperors, and Chinamen, bookkeepers
and assassins, have all in turn realised this fact;
they have spent the little span of their existence
in eating fat meat and laying on adipose tissue
and then the caravan has come for them and they
have had to start. We run those solemn thoughts
Into this notice of “Ermlnie,” now progressing at
Sydney l oyal, because that opera was evidently
built to reconcile man to his Inevitable fate and
make him feel that he is willing to go. It inspires
resignation and holy calm, and after sitting it
out the sinner experiences a desire to coil up bis
tall and silently steal away lo a better world,
while his earthly remains are softly carried by a
half-bred ass to some spot on a lonely hillside
where the wild winds roar and the bulls tack un-
easily against the blast. “Ermlnie" is a tale of
two convicts set to slow music, who escape and
enter violently into the society of a lot of respect-
able, solemn, dismal people. The convicts them-
selves are a brilliant brace of rascals, but they bave
heavy odds to wrestle with. One of them,
William Elton, is a hound with an um-
brella and a nail at the end of it, a little
yellow man dressed in rags who sticks his bine
moulded gamp in' the earth and contemplates it
with reverent admiration, and app irently he has
left his bones at home. He is a quivering, shaky
dwarf built of blanc-mange, and torn and rent
with merriment; he is filled up with gags, his
hair stands on end, his feet are immense, his
clothes ace held together with nails, hair, bits of
wire, and the lire, and the exertion cf keeping
himself together under these circumstances has
apparently reduced hia brain to atrophy ; yet amid
all these difficulties he passes himself off as a
Baron, and hooks the portable property of the
upper clasies to such an extent that the nobility
has to go home with hardly anything on. His
companion, Howard Vernon, is taller and more
dignified; he has six large patches on his pants,
and he falls out of top-storey windows with energy
and despatch. He also passes as a viscount, and
blasts coin out of the aristocracy. The exertions
of this pair save the opera from softening of the
third act, but they are bowled out while in the act
of retreating with six elephant-loads of burgled
goods, and the rest of the characters fall
flatter than a pancake dropped in the ashes.
The heroine, Krmioie, is a commonplace
girl who Is ordered by her father to marry
the lag without the umbrella simply because
that outcast has a viscount’s name on hla linen
and his carpet-bag, and she sings little, slow,
shock-headed songs about the misery of becoming
a oly-faker’s bride and the consort of a party who
slopes with wipes, when she has given her heart
to the long, thin, timid man of obscure but re-
spectable origin whom her father employs at a
small salary. Miss Leonara Brabam sings these
dismal melodies prettily and plays Biminie for all
she is worth, but that is not much. Miss Col-
borne-Balier keeps another washed-out girl from
foundering, and expends upon her more talent
than she is worth. Mr. Edwin Kelly represents a
marquis who ought to be roasted whole and given
to the poor; Miss Maggie Moore makes a gor-
geous part out of a country girl in a short frock ;
Mr. Woodfleld has been doomed by an unfeeling
management to represent a secretary who is so
full of melancholy that it ia doubtful if he could
remember to keep his hair out of the bash ; and
Mr. Benham is good as a fat, comic publican.
Also Mr. Duncan Young is In good condition,
and is tied to a tree. “ Erminle," on
the whole, is a first-rate opera for a man
to get away from and have a drink and
then forget to come back. We give it this word
of praise che jrfully out of the fulness of our
overcharged heart, and we will never go back
on it.

The Federal Minstrels are growing more

viving half of the split hero continued the struggle
for upwards of half an hour, and ultimately tore
the head off the other man's horse and scored a

Some responsible individual still keeps on
advertising the long list of old nobilitee who are
to prop up the Sydney “ Centenary Universal Ex-
hibition ” with an energy worthy of a higher
cause. At the time of writing (Tuesday) all sorts
of rumours are about, but the general idea is that
the proceedings will open with a procession and a
brass band, after which the swells of N.B.W. will
advance, each preceded by a flunkey carrying hfs
coronet on a plate, and followed by several clerks
who will convey his initials. Behind them will
oome the Lancers, and Nosey Bib, and the gaol-
flogger, and the Transit Commissioners all at full
gallop, with the Permanent Artillery, and the
Dawes’ Point fortifications, and Carlrgton’s letter
of condolence to the burnt-out Hordern, and
Beach and M'Namara hooraying in their wake
with Parkes’ last insolvency schedule on a pole
and the Relief Fund in a wheelbarrow, and the
Federal Minstrels and the Botany Handicap and
the Dead-House, and Uncle Abigail’s bank, and
the last of the Empire nigger compositors, while
the rear will be brought up by a mixed gathering
of Anarchists, larrikins, Chinamen, and land-
sharks, with King Billy last of all. An ox, it is
also reported, ia to be roasted whole and dis-
tributed to the poor, but as the roasting is to start
on Wednesday morning and the distribution ia to
take place on Wednesday afternoon, and it re-
quires nearly 20 hours to roast a whole ox de-
cently, and an ox roasted whole is odious any-
how, and as it would take six elephants rather
than one old, leathery bull to go round the poor
of Sydney, this part of the programme is not a
very promising one. We pin our faith to the pro-
cession.

A miserable creature wrote to the Mel-

symptoms of subdued satisfaction. There are

critic of Faure and Foil, but left him to guess at
the spelling of their distinguished names. No
printer is responsible for those errors.

The pillars of Melbourne sasilety are not
madly planking down their three half crowns for
“circle" seats at the Princess’s, but business is
good in other parts of the home. Truth to tell,
the Federici tragedy was a melancholy at*. for
“Faust," and the movements of the new MepMe-
topheles are followed with weird, - peculiar in-
terest. Young Mr. St. Clair—dropped into the
gap at briefest notice—shapes very fairly well, so
far as he gae?. but he doem’t go very far, and he
looks too fresh and blooming for his part. The
Devil is, according to all accounts, a used-up
individual with a game leg and deep furrows of
dissipation in his manly cheeks. Now, there is
nothing about St. Clair to provoke a shudder
from a Sunday school teacher. The rest of the
show is as on the opening night—gorgeously feeble
and splendidly tame. Too frequently the wails of
the songsters are drowned by the swelling melody
of a largely increased orchestra. Kennedy, the
mesmerist, has kindly left off at the Opera House,
and now Gratban Riggs is to toe Lone wish his
“ Irish Detective." Mr. Riggs has been working
that mine for sem 5 years, but it keeps paying c ivi-
deuds, and pre ent operations promise another
satisfactory yield.

One of the greatest shams on the modern

bed In full view of the audience. There is
nothing real about it, somehow, and nobody
believes in it. But it was not always thus, and
an American paper tells how it was done long
ago when “La Belle Helene” was running in
New York, and weeps for the times that are
past“ Of all the go-to-bad acts that have de-
lighted theatregoers, ‘La Belle Helene,’ with
Almee, when it was first produced in New York,
has the lead to this day for friskiuess. After
Menelaus departs, pending the visit of Paris,
Helene, magnificently dressed, wrapped in a
gorgeous cloaking garment, stood a moment
in the glowing lights; then, turning them
down and singing softly, she dropped the big
satin wrap, she loosed the shining satin, she
put off her jewels, the unlaced a corsage, she
crept out of a peiticoat, sha sat down with un-
bound hai r and undid a pretty sandal bno", she
Ceyed with a stocking cf violet-embroidered silk,
and finally whipped it off; she nursed her pretty
pink foot, and old men with bald heade got nn-
tloipative and uneasy; she took both bottinea off,
and flapped their soles softly together in time
with the soft and langoroua air she was half sing-
ing, half chanting ; she got yp and unclasped her
cerulean satin corset. Aimee had a plump and
pleasing person, poor dear, in those days. There
was just a nice armful of pretty woman let loose
on the vision In this proceeding. A subtle smell
of subtle rose perfume came over the footlights as
Almee in the one clinging garment skipped
behind a scene and emerged with a silken robe de
nuit half over her head. Into this she crawled,
and then throwing off the coverlid from a luxu-

Helene went to bed, while the hearts of half the
women and all the men beat responsive."

A man named Hcgdkin, who spent three

we gather that he feels hurt on account cf some

Politics were not in a very nourishing state in Australia,
and this was admitted by the colonists themselves. In some
countries the payment of members of Parliament brought
forward a very inferior class of candidates, and some of
them made promises which they were not able to keep, and
if kept, would be highly impolitic. The members of Parlia-
ment, and even the statesmen, were easily accessible. The
lecturer remembered at one time during his stay having an
interview with one of the colonial Premiers, during which a
reporter coolly opened the doorand asked the Prime Minister
if there was any news for the evening papers. (Laughter.)
Fancy an Australian member of Parliament
making promises which he isn’t able to keep !
Imagine Haynes doing such a thing! Contem-
plate Parkes trylrg it ! And when you have con-
templated try to imagine an English M.P., such
as Balfour or Hughee-Ha'lett, sinking so miserably
low! Anjone who wants to realise the great
gulf that separates Australian from English politics
has only to keep his eye on Hodgkin and note the
horror of that man at the sight cf a politician
making promises which he isn’t able to keep.

When the Naval Defence Bill was before

Mr. John Shephard administered a galvanic

Empire,” and the business was nearly through
when Shephard rose with a derisive hoot, and
asked what it was all about ? Then it suddenly
dawned on the House that it didn’t know, and the
President hastily telephoned to the Premier to ask
what they had been going on like that for. Did
this country thirst for a patent collapsible cata-
maran merely as a sign of British supremacy,
Shephard wanted to know, or was it intended as
a means of saving them from a foreign yoke 1 In
that case, where was the yoke? Nobody could

He addressed them in the interests of his sorrowing

time when half the population didn’t know where
they would get their next waistcoat, it would be
impossible for him to go home and slumber peace-
fully, with a pair cf cold feet planted in his back
and the dog screaming in the yard. He demanded,
therefore, that the Bill should be put* into the
stove by acclamation, or else thrown out of the
window to the goats, and that the men who voted
for it should be held accursed in this world, and
should be expelled from the refreshment-room and
doomed to eat cold potatoes on the stairs. The
speaker wound up with an eloquent peroration,

screamed wildly that he was disgusted, surprised,
and bitterly disappointed at the language of the

filled with the faith which would remove moun-
tains and arable lands and shift real preparty from
its basis, and New Zealand was going to have its
ironclad fleet though the windows of the House
had to be stuffed with old hats. Let the country
dine on state horse, so long as it lived up to the
traditions of its forefathers. The other members
of the institution agreed with Whitaker, and the

Australia versus England.
Dear Bulletin, —lb appears to be your
aim to embitter the Australian people as much as
possible against the English. No opportunity is
lost to sneer at and deride anything English, and,
apparently, simply because it is English. The
Bulletin seems to lose sight altogether of the
fact that the “ distinguished visitors," the ‘ Im-
perial Federatlonists," the “Lord Braeseys,” &0.,
are as much despised by the English people as
they can be by the Australian people, as repre-
sented by The Bulletin, and ib never seems to
be suspected that those same English are ae much
opposed to Salisbury's action, to priestcraft, and
monarchy as are the men of N.S W, to Parkes's
idiotic 44 Dead House.” English people are appa-
rently judged by The Bulletin by the actions of
their Government. What would be the character
of NS.W. If the same rule were applied? Even as
the Australian ideal people are at heart Republi-
can and liberty-loving, so are the English, in spite
of the Da Bressis, and any English workman will
tell you that a London mechanic is considerably
more Republican than any Australian, and the
chances are that the English Republic will (jive
Australia her freedom before the Australians
summon up enough pluck to ask for lb.
* » *'
And all this balk has been generated by
reading the letter of “A Growler" in your last
issue. That gentleman first makes an attack on
the English climate, and then goes on to contrast
living In England with In Australia, and. so as to
make the contrast more forcible, he takes the most
wretched class In England and puts ib side by side
with the case of a wefi-to-do meohanlo In Austra-
lis. But to deal with the climate first. Cold,
rain, and fog, appear to be moat of “ A Growler’s ”
troubles. Leaving aside the question as to why
he stays there. If he doesn't like It (poverty can-
not be the cause, as he allows he only went to
England to spend the money made in Australia),
I would like to enquire whether heat, files, mos-
qultce®, dust, lack of water, and the absence of
anything approaching the comforts of a home.
are not a sufficient set-off to these Inconveniences ?
In the cold weather of England one can go out
: for a brisk walk with the blood dancing through
his veins and feel as if he were alive. What a
contrast to the languid saunter that characterises
I the people of Australia ! And as the walk is one
of the strongest marks of character so the 44 Aus-
tralian crawl" is the vary essence of the languid
indolent Australian nature. Americans don’t
stroll along the streets, nor do the English, and
rapid movements are characteristic of their
energetic nature. Again, even “Growler” is
forced to admit the picturesque loveliness of the
changes wrought by the seasons in an English
landscape. But he doesn’t contrast those scenes
with the dull, sombre, burnt-up, dusty, unchange-
able monotony of the Australian scene, therefore
I take the liberty of doing It for him.
• * *
Now, to turn to the social conditions of the
two nations. “Growler” says he would like all
Australians to see the condition of the English
labourer. I am not going to give any fancy
sketches; I know that their lot Is bad enough,
but is the Australian labourer's any better 2 Re-
member. the Englishman has been used to It, and
his hardy nature doesn’t feel it as much as one
would expect, but that is not the case with the
Australian. Two-thirds of the labourers here are
mechanics, storemen, clerks, oounterhands, &c.,
who never knew what pick-and-shovel work
meant before. They go out and camp in tents
and eat salt mutton and damper, and drink liquid
mud, and swelter in the fierce sun, and gasp in
the hot winds, and flounder in the rain and slush,
and are, aceordlng to “Growler," supremely
happy. Perhaps if he had experienced it as I
have he would nob be quite so sure about that.
As to the mechanics, if the labourer gets IS?, per
week, the mechaulo gets £2 usually. lam a
mechanic, and at the age of 17 earned 25?. a week
In London. At the age of 211 was earning £1 a
week In this very city of Sydney, and, later, 30s.
in Melbourne. My brother, who came out with
me, has never been able to get a day’s work at his
trade since he landed. With regard to the home
of the English mechanic as drawn by “ Growler,"
let him swallow and digest this 'The landlady
of the house at which I am now living pays
£1 per week rent. There are six alleged rooms
with partitions of match-boarding not reaching
within three feet of the ceiling, and a yard six-feet
wide by 15 long, all in the last stage of dilapida-
tion, That is Australia. The house where I lived
in London, and where my parents still live, con-
tains six rooms with brick wails, flreplacs in each
room, a garden 20 feet by about 120, gay with
flowers, and the rent, O, '‘Growler!” was 8s 6d
per week and no taxes. To sum up, I have no
hesitation in saying that the English labourer
with his 18s, and the mechanic with his £2, are
fifty limes better off, when in work, than the
Australian labourer with his 6a a day. or the
mechanic with his £3 per week—when he can get
it—also supposing them in work. Of course, there
is the usual little fable about the absence of meat
in England, but “Growler” gives himself away
by saying the men eat bacon. So likely they
would buy bacon at Is a bound when they can get
meat at 4d and od !

Now comes the usual indignant query—
-44 If you were so much better off in England, why
the adjective nonn (or It wouldn’t be Aus-
tralian) did you leave ?" Well, dear friends, I
left because ninety-nine hundredths of the Aus-
tralians in England are d liars. Is that an
answer ? “ Well, why the adjective-noun
again -don’t you go back?" Patience, dear
friends, I am working 16 hours a day In Sydney,
and saving nearly a pound a week, and when I
get enough to pay my passage, greased lightning
will have to be smart to pass me on the way to the

BRIEF MENTION.
M.P.- Mag pie,
A qoartfi-mlne. —A pub.
A boarding-houae has been destroyed by
fire in a Melbourne suburb. Hashes to ashes.
If gold was “ Money ” Miller’s god, of
course the great financier has gone “below” to
meet him.
A certain Melbourne lawyer contends that
the “ purse-trick ’’ is a game of skill. His clients
know that.
There is some talk of forming a society of
midwives in Melbourne. Will they advocate
ighthours’ labour?
A great change is coming over England.
“John Bull, a half-caste,” has got six months In
Sydney for shooting a man.
David Gaunson says the Victorian Licens-
ing Act has not a leg to stand upon. Then
wherefore so many breaches ?
A stump-extractor of 15 horse-power Is
advertised for sale in a Ballarat paper. Some
dentist retiring from biz., no doubt.
Brisbane Courier says, “ the Prince of
Wales is the son of his mother." Comment would
only aggravate the offence.
It is proposed to establish large smelting-
works on the Yaira, near Melbourne. Meanwhile
the establishments in the vicinity are easily smelt.
The Sydney Evening Hews says, “ the
hand of fate is heavy on the house of Hohenzollern."
We defy Parkes to repeat this sentence within
one month.
Bishop Moorhouse has preached to the
Queen. We expect this honour will lead Jimmy
Manchester to change his views regarding prayer
for reign.
Hobart Mercury says the local city fathers
are “dirt bags, and their name’, like their acts,
will everlastingly stink in the popular nostrils."
It’s no good talking in that way in Sydney.
Frederick Fraser, of North Melbourne,
got three months’ hard labour for striking his
mother In the eye with a pat of butter one day
last week. The charge was ‘ 4 eye-salt and buttery.”
A Victorian judge with solemn naivete
enquired the other day what a “long beer"
meant. It was a fearfully hot day, and yet
nobody in the court had the decency to ask him
out.
A Queensland company has been floated
in London called “The Bishop's G:eat Gold-
Mining Company.” The next company formed in
the same place should be called “The Collection
Plate."
A discussion on “ How to lie when
asleep" has spread into nearly every English-
speaking paper In the world. The investigation
was. no doubt, instigated in the interests of the
Freetrade party.
Speaking of a man who was gored by a
cow, Melbourne Herald says : 14 Deceased had a
rent In his stomach six inches long and four
deep." We claim the Italics, and advise the
Herald man to take a lesson in anatomy.
Major Lovelock, of the Wellington (N.Z.)
Harmy, put his foot down heavily at a howling-
match recently. “Now, my friends," said the
Major, “I'm a goin’ to pass the plate round, and
I caution you all to put in your money, every bit
of it. Open your hearts and empty your pockets.
Don't keep hanythink back, or you may ba struck
dead like Ananias and Sophias, as you’ve just
been a-readin' of. Take warnin’ by that ere
married couple without hlncumbranc?. and don't
hold owt back.” The Major sat down, and the
plates went merrily round —and came back with
the usual assortment of old copper and brass
buttons.


PERSONAL ITEMS.
A nephew of Yon Moltke Is at work in
Victoria as a rabbiter.
Emperor William was a soldier to the
last. He died on the March.
Queen Victoria has netted £500,000 by
her Jubilee. She received half-a-mlllion in pre-
sents and didn’t spend a cent.
There are three alleged Australians in the
English House cf Commons —Childers, Henniker-
Heaton, and Sir Salmon Wile on
Isaac Selby, Freethought lecturer, has
taken in hand a tough contract. He is now a
rival editor of Thadaus O’Kane at Charters
Towers.
Lord Hindlip, son of Allsopp, the Burton
brewer, never drinks his father s beers, and smiles
sadly at the mention of the humble colonial three-
penny. He is travelling for his heiltb.
A wild admirer of Parkes deliriously
winds np a paragraph on that gantleman in a now
country paper with the remark, “Long may old
Harry reign." Yet he honestly intended a com-
pliment !
Several of the recently-appointed N.S.W.
judges have been worried a good deal by having to
refuse to try cases in which they had been interested
while at the Bar. Judge Foster, however, hasn't
been troubled that way.
South African papers report that Rexnenyi, ,
the violinist, is not dead, but in the shipwreck he
lost his collection of violins. He is said to be
playing at Kimberley on the diamond fields. We
sincerely hope this is true.
Henry Green, the Bourke squatter, who
was shot down a few years ago by a station-hand, \
has now, we hear, almost recovered. His would-
be assassin, on being satisfied his victim was dead,
shot himself through the heart.
Tne statement of the London sassiety cor-
respondent of the S.M Herald that Tummy did
not visit one of John L. Sullivan’s bunkum fisti-
cuff shows and was not introduced to the boss
braggart of the planet, is untrue. Yates, of
the London World, gives full particulars, and
states he was there.
An articled clerk In Melbourne has had a
little bother about his certificate. It appears that
this document was in two days late. The names
of the e’erk are Edouard Holroyd George Alfred
Louis Alphonse Permezel. The Judges decided
that under the oirenmstancss the delay was ex-
cusable. We should 1 hink so.
Henry Chaplin, the new South Australian
Governor. Is a played-out turf plunger and friend
of Tummy’s, whom he helped to persuade to go on
the turf just when Rosebery had the good sense
to see he was being robbed and abandoned It.
Cbaplin owes his billet to “ Wales.” of course, and
he will run it on the cheap like Loftns.
Joe Symes, the Melbourne Freethought
Apostle, was nearly being sold up, the other day.
by the minions of the District Court. The sale
was deferred till his notice of appeal was decided
upon. There would have been a bad quarter of
an hour for a number cf personages holding high
positions in Heaven if that sale had not been
stopped.
The late Mr. Federicl stated that he was
first cousin to Colonel Valentine Baker, on the
strength of which connection he brought out a
letter of introduction to Sir Henry Loch, and was
onca invited to dine with that great man. Talk-
ing of Va l . Baker it seems that the amorous
warrior only left £4OOO behind him, so he didn’t
spoil the Egyptians to any considerable extent.
The Duke of Rutland, who has just been
gathered to his fathers, acquired distinction in
his earlier days. As the Marquis of Granby, he
figured on the sign-board of many an old English
pub,, being an even more popular favourite than
Wellington or Nelson in this respect. Didn’t the
“ vldder ” who married Sam Weller's father keep
the “Marquis of Granby,” and wasn’t it there
that Sbiggins liquored free on pineapple rum ?
It is said that the Prince of Wales has
been making heavy bets for years past that he
will not outlive his mother, the money, if he wins,
to be divided between his two sons. Until some
two or three years ago these Inspiriting offers used
to be accepted cheerfully, but of late Wales has
grown balder and more unsteady on his legs and
his hands shake in the morning in a suggestive
way. and now very few care to wager about him,
A Queensland paper describes Bishop
Webber as “a tallish, well-nourlsbecl, rather
awkward sort of man, with a foxy beard and an
occiput inclined to be bald ; no sort of figure, and
doesn't wear stays or improver; beard and fore-
head held at an angle of 45 degrees to the horizon;
expressionless eyes; restless demeanour; takes
25 seconds of silent preliminary prayer always;
prize-fighter’s nose; theocratic, mythical, and
oracular."
Thera is a story about old Peter Faucatt,
the N.S.W. Supreme Court Judge who lately re-
tired." He was somewhat short-sighted, and one
day a very diminutive barrister appeared before
him to move something or other. When
the short man stood up alongside “ Jumbo,”
a very tall barrister, who was sitting
down their heads were about on a level,
and as soon as the small man began, “If your
Honor please, I ” “Ye must stand up when
v’ address the Coort," interrupted old Peter, iras-
cibly “I am standing up,” said the small man,
with dignity. “Then tell the gentleman along-
side ye to sit down.”
When Graham Berry gave up the little
huckster’s shop on the Toorak road, he conceived
and carried out the project of purchasing a small
suburban paper, the Coxxingwood Advertiser.
Soon afterwards he attempted one night to take a
seat in the reporters’ gallery, but the high-toned
representatives of the wealthy morning journals
obieoted and the then Speake-, Sir i rands
“iurphy sustained the objection. The little
'Tizeb did not indulge in extended parliamentary
reports, and no seat or desk was set apart for that
Journal. So that the man who afterwards led the
House and ruled the country was refused a seat
in the reporters’ gallery.
Mr Frank Molynenx Govett, one of the
most able exponents of the doctrines of Herbert
Spencer that ever visited Sydney, was, the other
evening, banqueted by the members of the Cen-
tury Club, prior to his departure for Europe in
the Habsburg. Mr. Govett, the son of an arch-
deacon of the Anglican Church, was trained for
the Church, but inheriting revolutionary and
socialistic sympathies from Barras, the French
Republican leader, of whom he was a grandson,
he surrendered his ecclesiastical prospects. Mr.
Govett Intends, during his stay in Europe, to pub-
lish a work upon which he has been engaged for
many months, giving the result of his investiga-
tions into the evidence of psychical! and physical
phenomena when considered in the light of
natural science.
Bismarck,, it is well known, was always
strongly opposed to the marriage of the Grown,
Prince with Hhe English Princess Royal, and he is
never tired of pointing outs to his familiars the sad
degeneration effected in the Hohenzolleres by
crossing their blood with the vitiated fluid which
runs in the veins of the Gnelphs. The eldest eon
of the Crown Prince, now practically Regent, is a
deformed and scrofulous dandy. Hla father, who
has undergone, the hardships of many campaigns,
' was. on the contrary, un bli shortly befono%lB pre-
sent Illness, a man so vigorous that he was able
to jump early every morning into tte ice-cold
swimming-bath at the b; it racks.
The faultless form, of ex-Dekscfcive Otto
Berliner is now to be s aen on the Sydney block,
t Otto caused a lot of official trouble to the late
Captain Scandish over the alleged Incapacity of
ithat gallant officer to manage <laa Victorian
police force. Berliner having shaken the official
dust off his feet, started a .private enquiry office,
which has been highly successful. He is the
man who chartered a steamer and followed the
absconder Ilosenwax to *TJji (before Thakombau
gave up his crown and sceptre to Sir Hercules
Robinson), and brought ,hia man back in triumph
to penal servitude in Peabridge prison. In those
far distant days Fiji was the absconder's paradise.
Contingent upon Mr. Fkanbc Farnell’s Bill to
legalise the totalisator In Ifew South Wales, a
number of people—some of wham know all about
the subject, and some nothing—have rushed into
print in the columns of the daily papers to argue
for and against the legalising of batting. Practi-
cally the whole question is ouo which lies em

tirely outside the province of politic?. People
will bet and gamble till jthe crack of doom.
For all essential purposes gambling is legalised
already. Stock-broking, ebare-jobbing, mining
and land speculation are all legalised forms of
gambling just as much as the faro-tables of Monte
Carlo. Newspapers—the alleged guardians of
national purity—are only gigantic gambling
machines themselves, especially when they are
run in the interests of land-jobbing and mine-
speculating syndicates. Whether the New South
Wales Parliament legalises the totalisator or nob,
matters very little, so far as principle is concerned.
One thing is certain, if people dissipate their
money in racing, they have no “coin" with
which to speculate in mining booms, and the
bloated silver shark is just as much a public
robber as the leviathan bookmaker. Human
nature dearly loves a little illicit excitement, and
just as men who eschew alcoholic drink and
tobacco smoke take to morphia, opium, and other
injurious drugs, so the natural gambler indulges
his propensity without let or hindrance, it not on
the racecourse, on the Stock Exchange or the
wheat market. Men cannot be legislated to
church, neither can the natural man be suppressed
by Acta of Parliament. Laws can be framed,
however, to keep the business straight, and in
some countries the State has sense enough to re-
cognise this and to conduct lotteries, &c., under
governmental supervision. It is only fair to ask
the same Ministry that legalises the totalisator to
establish a State Mont deplete, which would
render impossible the extortions of the politician-
conducted bank with its 200 per cent, intercut on
blood-sweating loans to necessitous workmen.'
Says the S.M. Herald In connection
with something or other “ The various gifts of
Moses and of Aaron may be united, but are not
necessarily found together.” Certainly not.
You’ll generally find that Moses runs his iust up
the street, while Aaron obliges the Gentiles round
the corner,
POLITICAL
POINTS
The debt of the United States was decreased
during 1887 by 112,000,000d01a. Protection at Its
damnable tricks again, and the country wobbling
to destruction.
The Australian Trades Congress has re-
fused all “ patronage.” A workman is president,
and Premier Griffith’s efforts to join In the crowd
have been out short straight off.
Unfortunate Parkes we know
Continues to aggravate us,
For a State House he will go,
To post-mortem preserve his status.
A Queensland paper chronicled a Chinese
meeting under the heading of “Parliament of
N.S. Wales.” It may have been a mistake, but
it was not so very misleading when you come to
think of it.
The “great” Unionist gathering to wel-
come Goschen and Partington, the Coerolonists,
to Dublin, was a bogus. They couldn't drag
together more than 3000 people out of 300,000 in
the whole town.
It is proposed to stop all business of a
controversial nature in the British Commons at
1 o’clock p.m. The N.S.W. Legislature should
follow suit. Larry Foley always closes his boxing-
hall at 11 sharp.
Frank B. Suttor, formerly Postmaster-
General and M.P. for Bathurst, is back from Eng
land, a stronger Protectionist than he-was when
he left N.S.W. a year ago. Mr. Suttor will oust
Dr. Cortis very easily at next election.

Five years ago the Brisbane eight-hours’
men were refused passage down Qaeen-street, and
the CouftiEß sneered at them as a smelly crowd
of ill-dressed agitators. To-day the procession
suspends all traffic in the city, and Jthe Courier
grovels to the Trades' Union movement. Eggs
is riz.
As an amendment to Mr. Thompson’s
motion in favour of adopting new rules to check
disorder in the N.S.W. Assembly, Mr. Hassall
gave notice of a proposal that there should be
erected at Parliament Houses a 21-ft. prize-ring
to enable members to settle differences arising in
debate.
At the close of a large political meeting
at Stockton, N. 8. W., the other Saturday night,
cheers for the Queen were ineffectually called for.
Hardly a cheer could be raised from the thousand
persons present—in fact the groans predominated.
Both the local and the Sydney press are silent on
the subject.
At the dinner of the eight hours’ men at
Brisbane, the toast of ‘‘The Day we Celebrate”
was substituted for her Gracious and his Excel-
lency and all the foreign potentates, who were not
mentioned at all; but the demand for “ throe
cheers for the Federated Republic of Australasia"
brought down the house,
The N.S.W. Protectionist party have
tempted Hon. Edmund Barton in every possible way
to leave his seat in the Upper House and enter the
Assembly, bub “Toby" is not yet willing. G. R.
Dlbbs doesn’t like the idea of Mr. Barton entering
the Assembly, as he is afraid the latter gentleman
would at once be chosen as the Protectionist
leader.
Said Delegate Weillant at the Australian
Trades Union Congress “ Buggies and carriages
come out here from America that had been made
in the penitentiaries of the States. A federated
tariff was of the greatest importance, and if they
could decide that question, the federation of the
whole of the colonies would become a certainty."

Dear Bulletin,— M ‘I I wraith accepted his
knightshlp as a crushing reply to the Griffith
party’s assertion, after the steel-rails fizzle, that
he was known at the Colonial Offloe as a swindler

because he was an Imperialist and a snob at
heart. There is a difference between them.—
Yours, Bananaman.
Dear Bulletin, —The throwing down and
smashing of the statues in Fitzroy Gardena wants
a word of explanation. Melbourne workmen,
who are willing to work and can't get work, and
so have to see their wives and children plnobir g
and starving, can’t for the world make out what
the Government means by getting out statues
from England at the expense of the tax payers ?

“If we had to deal with gentlemen, the
Government would know what 'to do,” said
Parkep, in the N.S.W. Assembly, the other day.
We doubt it. Parkes never did deal with gentle-
men ; he hasn’t had any experience that way.
And gentlemen never did deal much with Parkes
—at least, the same gentleman never dealt with
him twice if he could help it
Premier Griffith s manifesto Is a complete
fizzle. Proffers no programme whatever. The
word Land-tax does not odour In lb. This was the
condition of the supporc ot Dickson, the auctioneer
and ex-treasnrer, hnd the city land-sharks. The
word Protection does not occur In it, and the
whole thing is so hopelessly tentative that BulcOck
and the importer’s-ringara pledged not to sece&e.
The “Royal Irish” constabulary are be-
coming disaffected with Balfour and Co.-eroibn.
They refused to interfere with the soldiers who
broke out of the barracks, cheering for O’Brien,
and now, after a tussle with the Castle au
thorities, they carry the day, and put up a pic-
ture of Gladstone in the place of honour In the
Dublin barracks dining room. It was ‘ ‘ removed”
no less than four times. All along the line, Co-
ercion is getting the jim-jams.
The enfant terrible of the N.S.W. Opposi-
tion is “ Jim” Toohey, member for South Sydney,
whoee party seem to think be does them more
harm than goof, and wish he would shift his
quarters to the Ministerial side of the House.
Last week he had a serious personal quarrel with
Mr. Dlbbs, who told him to go away and speak to
him no more. Later the same evening, Toohejr
spoke at Granville, and told the audience that it
did not follow that if the N.B.W. electors sent a
Protectionist majority to Parliament Dibbs would
be Premier.
According to the Queenslander ;—“ Henry
George says men cannot own land because theiy
did nob create it, and the Omaha World a?da
that George therefore has no right to his head
because ho did not make it. This relieves Henry
of a fearful responsibility." That a man’s head
is not his own, no one admits more fully than
Henry George himself. For years and years he
not only allowed the barber to reap and take his
crop of hair,, but he actually paid him for doing it.
And now that he has grown, permanently bald,
George cultivates the brains Inside his head, and
gives the world the benefit of the result for a mere
song.
Alexander Connor jumped out of the top-
storey window of a Melbourne hash emporium one

months' bill.
The N.Y. Standard says of the Sydney
Morning Herald “ This paper meets every
demand for reform with the remark that ‘ it is too
much,’ and comments on every concession made
with the observation that ‘it is enough.’" Of the
Sydney Daily Telegraph it remarks The
other morning paper is inclined to be somewhat
piebald In its principles. . . . The creed of
the Telegraph seems to be 1 God is good, but the
devil’s not a bad sort, after all.’ The Evening
News— poor thing !—has not yet ventured an
opinion, and unkind people say that it hasn’t got
one to venture." Pastor Jefferis is dismissed
summarily with : “ a successful land-specu-
lator, by-the-bye- who airily disposes of the whole
land-nationalisation question In five minutes' in-
solent and patronising twaddle, and straightway
proceeds to lecture bis flook on ‘ How to be merry

Sir William Jervois, Governor of New
Zealand, was recently interviewed by an irate
female with a big bnstle, who said, “You are Sir
William Jervois, are you not?” H. E. admitted the
liability. “ And you are G jvernor of Noo Zealand,
haintyou?” The Guv. gave in he was. “Then," said
she, “Icometoarsk your honor to git my hus
band harrested. He s gone horf with another
woman, and left me with eight children to per-
vlde fur.” The Governor said it was a hard case,
but she had come to the wrong shop. “ Well, if
you can’t harrest him," she said, “I want you to
git me a divorce, and then I can git another man
to keep me.” The Governor was sorry, but that
was also beyond his powers “ Can’t harrest me
hflsband or get me a divorce, and yon call your-
self Governor of Noo Zealand! Well, 1 dunno
whatever you’re good for, then, and I wish yon
good mornln’.” With that she turned her bustle
indignantly on his Excellency, and retired.
There has been a baby-show at Too-

Five cherubs waltzed off with prizes, and the un-

the enraged and slighted matrons
who had no prizes that they had
better go away and try and do
better next time. This consolation
was received with a concentrated
glare of withering scorn, and as the
unsuccessful mothers filed out into
the sunlight such remarks as
“Freckled brat" and “Sore-nosed
imp ” wafted gently down the balmy
air. Consequently up Toowoomba
way the spectacle of two respect-
able matrons snorting at one another
in the main street is as common as

“ladies" or “gentlemen" as the
term Is at present accepted, and we
fail to see why they wish to be
considered so. Is the girl at the
ribbon-counter ashamed of being a
woman ? Is the youth in the shirt-
department appalled that we should
call him a man ? As citizens of the
coming Republic they should rather
fiercely resent the Interference
which classes honest toilers with
the drones and butterflies, who,
under the names ot “lady" and
“ gentleman," idly prey and fatten

The Victorian Postmaster-
General has sent an order to Scot-
land for a supplementary peal of
bells to be placed in the new clock-
tower in the General Post-Office.
The set Is to automatically produce
national airs. Among these we
notice, under the head, we suppose,
of national airs of England, “God
bless the Prince of Wales.” There
seems to be a widespread impression
among “ loyalists” that Providence
Is not particularly favourable to
“ Tummy,” and that it is necessary
to keep his name well in front or
he might be treated like a demnition
common person. We see no other
reason for including that old hurdy-
gurdy hymn in a list of National
Airs, Ireland is not treated much
better. “ The Harp that once,”
&0., is well enough as far as it
goes, but why couldn’t they have
had In addition “ The Wearln’ of
the Green," “ The White Cockade,”
and a few other tunes of the sort
with some spirit in them ? It might
not have been a bad Idea to get a
set of bells that would have played “ The Wearln'
of the Green" and “ We'll kick King William
before us," to be followed immediately by “ Boyne
Water" and “ Crbpplos Lie Down.” This would
have been impartial and lively and calculated to.
keep the police from dying of fatty degeneration
of the feet. But what is the use of suggesting
ideas to oysters!

Two young and lovely creatures, both !
desperately mashed on one young man, met re-
cently on horseback in the Hutt-road, near Wel-
lington (N.Z.), When they saw each other ap-
proach they called out “Old cat!" simultaneously,
and whipped their steeds to the charge, each
determined to roll her rival in the dust under her
horse’s feet or perish in the attempt. In the
scene that ensued we did not take a hand, but
when the collision took place the sunshine was
darkened with a cloud of dust; two horses and
two Amazons tried to climb over each other’s
heads, while shrill shrieks, treble curses, flying
hats, and emancipated back hair obscured
the scenery. When the battle wan at
its height the Hntt tram came up from
the racecourse and ranged alongside, and the
matalllcians took out their note-books and be-
gan to bet on the little ’un with the bald head or
the stout one with the torn habit and the skinny
limbs as their fancy led them. When the engine-
driver blew the whistle of the engine to try and
stop the combat their horses took fright and
bolted so suddenly that they both fell off together
on the dusty road and fainted right away. Then
the male passengers rushed out of the tram and
50 flasks of brandy for their resuscitation flashed
forth. By and bye, they came to and were lifted
into the tram and taken back to the city on wheels.
Their horses got home before them.

A respected merchant of Melbourne, whose
bulky form and fine iron-grey whiskers may fre-
quently be seen together ab mt the Exchange, had
a game put up on him the other morning which,
for malice aforethought, cusiedness and deep dark
aggravation, is unparalleled by any instance men-
tioned in history. He was leaving his suburban
residence to catch the 10.20 train for the city on
the morning mentioned, when, on opening the
hall-door, a sight presented itself which froze his
young blood, and upended his hair like bristles on
the back of the fretful old bore ; for there on the
floor of the porch, sporting in the'sunshine, lay a
baby in a shirt-box —a very yoong baby with a
very bald head, and it kicked up Its heels, and
crowed in a manner which showed that it quite
concurred in the arrangement if not a party thereto.
On the breast of the babe was pinned a notice,
call i ng upon the respected merchant to take his child
and be kind to it, and heaven would forgive him.
To describe the manner in which the gentleman’s
angry passions rose and boiled over the edges
would take up too much of our valuable apace ;
suffice it to say that in two seconds he had that box
and its contents on the dining-room table and was
roaring for the servants and the police, and the
permanent artillery, and demanding in Imperious
tones if a man was a wet-nurse to have every-
body’s wall-eyed, red headed Infants thrust upon
his hands. At this stage the baby entered Its
protest with the force and volubility of a trom-
bone, and all the residents and visitors poured
into the room to make enquiries as to who had
been trodden on. Foremost amongst these was
the lady of the house, who had received the im-
pression that the place was on fire and her hus-
band was being slain by a daylight robber.
“ Good Heavens, George! what are you doing
with Tilly?" she gasped, and, snatching the
child out of the box, she proceeded to
hush it with energetic bangs on the back and
inelegant babble. “ Tilly ?” gasped George, with
the look of a man who Is just recovering from
the kick of a cart horse, and then the thought
that he had been sold suggested itself to him, and
he looked round for somebody to kill on the im-
pulse of the moment. The baba was his lawful
and well-beloved daughter, who had found her
way into the family a few weeks previously
and whom he had failed to recognise in conse-
quence of the shook to his nervous system, and
her marked resemblance to all the babies of her
age. There were staying in the house at the time
three impish female servants, two frivolous young
ladies, and a youthful male relative of the mer-
chant’s ; if any person or persons can point out
which of these six perpetrated the cruel hoax,
they will receive a reward of five pounds on ap-
plication at George’s oflice.

It was a black, sloppy night in Sydney.
The divinely-endowed singer Wilhlemlna Skeggs
had for two long hours held a brilliant and
dlstinguishsd audience in a state of soulful intoxi-
cation. Outside, the street-lamps threw their
awful mystic reflection in the spectral depths of
the mud-slime on the flags ; the rain poured down
with a ceaseless, wearying monotony—the rain on
this occasion was very wet rain—the cabs huddled
together in sympathy on the rank, and the police-
man kept his post beneath the shelter ot the most
water-proof verandah on his beat. Down the
Pactollan stair-ease, in the blazs of gaslight, rust-
ling in silks and flashing with jewels, their opera-

veins flowed the real, the genuine sang azul and
baal gammon. The wet urchin smelt a copper in
the air. He saw the lady’s hesitation and flew to
the succour of a woman in distress. “ Call Mrs.
Melohlsidec’s carriage," said the lady in her dulcet
tones. “ Lend’s yer umbrellerl” replied the
urchin. Two umbrellas were produced. Un-
willing to make ladles iealous, he annexed both.
Then out into the rain and the darkness wandered
he, yelling at the top of his stentorian voice,
“ Mrs. Melchisldec’s cab ; Mrs. Melchisidec’s
cab! ’ Four-and-twenty basses and baritones and
tenors belonging to four-and-twenty cabmen, and
100 boys in 100 dark dry corners, took up the eerie
cry and bellowed forth into the vasty deep of
night, “ Mrs. Melohlsidec’s cab ! Mrs. Melohisi-
dec’s cab I” “No! No!" cried the aristocratic
creature, in tones of agony; “ carriage . car-

ranks till It reached the 24th cabby, a young man of

querulously, * ’ What number ? ” and 400 boys from
400 dark, dry corners echoed, “ What number 2 ”

lungs, stalking importantly down the pavement

Dear Bulletin,— The autumn racing at
Klemlngton is always a poor advertisement for
dressmakers. The men who planned the races
probably did so with a recollection of the past
Cup-bills. Daring the transition-stage season
one is uncertain whether to appear as a brilliant
butterfly or a homely grab in a furred mantle,
while a compromise is often unique rather than
effective. On the first day of the races a most
singular gown (only the canaille now use the
word dress) was worn by a lady of the Govern-
ment House party, not one of the very vice-royal,
but almost all but. The gown was white, with a
large salmon-silk affair—which a rude man called
paniers—at the back. The costume locked like a
dish of shrimps on a white table-cloth. Her escort
was an aide-de-camp, with his socks down, or
perhaps they were gaiters. Lady Loch always
looks queenly—the word is used in a poetic sense,
and is intended for a compliment—except when
she appears in evening-dress. Then the upper
storey of |the frame-work upon which beauty Is
built is perhaps too palpable to be as charming as

A short and humble annal comes from
Singleton (N.S.W.) unique in its sweet simpli-
city. There was to be a corroboree in that sun-
baked township, and the cost to -view it was the
humble necessary threepenny-bit, During the
day the treasurer and his Mary went round sell-
irg greasy brick-coloured cards of admission to
whomsoever had the wherewithal. After they
had disposed of a good many they retired to their
hotel for refreshment. The anecdote ends right
here. P.S.—The corroboree didn’t eventuate.
Dear Bulletin,—! am a schoolteacher In
an outlandish district in N.S.W,, and am, conse]
quently, bossed by Mr Fuel-saver Inglis, ard, ap-
parently, by all his satellites also, right down to
the office-boy. Durirg Centennial week 1 re-
ceived the following little memo, from a school
attendance officer, which will serve to illustrate
the position —-
You must either collect all the fees owing at your school
at once, or show cause why your apparent neglect of duty
should not be reported to. the Minister.
Now, I have dene my level best to get in these
game fees by Issuing monthly accounts to default-
leg parent?, and by seeing them personally and
appealing to their finer feelings, if they have any,
and the exalted Bchool-attendarcs officer and the
district inspector were both acquainted with the
fact. But the heavy fathers of the district were
perfectly well aware that I had no earthly means
of enforcing payment, so they treated me with
derision. One brawny ruffian said, not to put too
fine a point upon it, that he “ would knock the
blarsted stuffing out of me,” and reached for my
hair, and it was only after jO minutes’ general ex-
citement, in the course of which the grass wastorn
up in all directions, that I brought him down with
a clip under the ear. But for this lucky hit I
would have been a bruissd and battered object,
and ’not fit to write to you. Another defaulter
told me to go to coloured Hades, and the rest
mostly seemed to agree with him and asked me to
start for the same place. In short, I found that
the N.S.W. Public Distinction Department had
appointed me £ s bum-bailiff without a bailiff s
powers, and it seems to me that it the Government
wants the fees so badly that the local intellect-
developer and Wd-lasher must spend all bis spare
time collecting them, they should erect cattle and
pig yards, poultry coops, produce stores, and
timber yards in connection with every country
school, so that the spreader of knowledge could
seize upon any portable property belonging to the
Insolvent ancestors of the pupils and turn the
fame into cash, with a reasonable commission on
all sales effected. Unless this is done it is useless
for the teacher to act the part of stage-thunder
for the Government, and shake the empty vessel
of his wrath at the public. My instructions were
to demand all sums exceeding ss, and to threaten
legal proceedings against everybody who didn’t
pay. Nobody paid ; everybody told mo to go to
the place already hinted at, and nobody took any
“ proceedings.” I had no power to proceed, and
the school-attendance officer wouldn’t. It is his
duty to collect the money, but, as he can't get it,
the Department throw the burden of his laziness
and incompetence upon a forlorn individual who
has all the rising generation for miles round to
spank, and when he fails to collect, without any
authority to hick him, the money which the
proper officer is unable to get In in spite of his
power to summon and distrain and all the rest of
it, he is “ reported to the Minister.” I maintain
that the sohool-attendance-offloer is inferior to the
teacher; for one thing I never heard of any
teacher being promoted to be an attendance officer
as a reward for good conduct, and for another the
bum-bailiff of the service is not necessarily a man
of either brains or education, and the teacher re-
quires both; and yet, under Tiger Inglis’s regime,
the lower offlc:r is allowed to write insolent
letters to teachers and threaten them with
penalties unless they perform without pay the
work which he Is appointed and paid to do
himself. So far, I have not succeeded in getting
in any outstanding fees, and other teachers of my
acquaintance have had Ihe same ill-lack. The
only promise of better times which has appeared
up to date is embodied in the following letter,
which one of them received last week. I have
the original, and guarantee its genuineness

Launceston, Tas , April 21, 1887. About tw
years and a half ago I ttok a fainting sensation
I went to one of the p inoipal doctors in the town
but gradually grew worse. I called in anothe:
doctor, and he told me he could do me no more goot
than the first doctor. I was advised to go to the
seaside; it did me no good, but I seemed to b
wasting away, I used to feel faint every hour
and I had a pain at my heart which would lav
for three days at a time. My breath was very
short, and I thought every hour would be my last
Dropsy set In in my feat very bad I was unable to
wear my boots, and could not walk any distance
without feeling very ill. I had a very bad pain ia
the top and back of my head, a severe p ain between
my shoulders, and down my back, and I ooulc
scarcely get my breatb. I hadabrating sensation
at the pit of my stomach, and after meals was
seized with such a violent pain in my stomach tha
I was afraid to take any food. A feeling woulc
come over me that I was going blind, and losing
the use of roy left side. A nervous perspiratlor
would come over me with a choking sensation in
the throat. My pulse was 120, and I thought 1
was going to di». My friends would have to walk
me a out to circulate my blood My friends ad
vised me to see the homoeopathic doctor, who re-
lieved my sufferings a good deal, tfoun after the
doctor left the town, and my brother spoke to me
about Warner's safe cure, and asked me to give It
a trial. I purchased a bottle and commenced
taking It, The first two bottles made me very sick
and ill ; I was obliged to lie down after taking it.
I have been taking it for over 12 months, and have
followed all the directions for diet. I can now
walk 6 miles without feeling faint, and am able to
do all n y own work. I have lost ready all the
distressing symptoms. I thank God that the medi-
cine has so ft r restored me and wou’d highly re c m-
mend It to anyone suffericg from ill-health —Rosa

Wabrnambool, Yict., July 15th, 1887. Three
years ago when confined I was taken seriously ill,
and was not expected to live. My case wai a
serious one. When passing water I was afflic’ed
with the most agoniting pains, which no doctor
could relieve. Night and day my pains were so
distressing that I could neither sit nor stand, and
I was unable to sleep. I had great pains in my
head, and was never free from sick headache.
My c aest was covered with a rash, and my legs
were very much swelled. My sides were ailing
fearfully, and I thought my end was near ; my skin
turned yellow, and my eyes sunk and turned blacx.
At that time, when I hoped that death would
relieve my misery, a friend advised me to try
Warner's safe cure. After having taken one bottle
with one vial of Warner’s safe pills, my pa'ns had
almost disappeared, and I felt as if 1 bad entered
intoa newexistence. I have now allege her used
18 bottles, and it has taken away all the swelling.
I am no longer afflicted with sick headache, all
pains have gone, and I am in the best of health.—
Mrs Hannah Henderson. Still further evi-
dence is given :-Mackay, Q , Cot. 17, 1887.
About two years ago I was taken seriously ill, and
my suffering in time increased so much that my
life was despaired of. My demise seemed s i near
at hand that the holy communion was administered
to me. In my back and under my shoulders,
my pain was so intense ihat I cannot describe It.
The in the lumbar region and in the pit of
the stomach were also agonising in the extreme,
and I thought my end had come. 1 was under two
different doctors, and was treated for tumour, kid-
ney and liver d’sease, to no effect. Last October
Warner’s safe cure was handed to me by my
husband. From the very start it eased my pains,
and with each bottle my system gathered strength.
I have now consumed 32 bottles of Warner's safe
cure, with a number of vials of Warner s safe pills,
and my pains have gradually abated, and I can
say that I have now pretty well recovered from a
very complicated and serious sickness, although I
was not expected to live. Mrs. Fredrick Weiskk
(wife of the overseer, Divisional Board). Warner s
safe cure is the wife’s and mother’s friend ; it acts
in harmony at all times and under all circum-
stance s with t heir delicate natures, and removes all
complaints peculiar to their sex, except those re-
quiring surgical relief.

An Historical Question.
Henry Ikin, descendant of a soldier in the
New South Wales Corps, dashes into type in the
columns of the Sydney Morning Herald to say
that everything that everybody else has said is
false. “My grandfather died before I was born,
but I have often heard the old story that had re-
ference to Governor Bligh and his arrest by
Major Johnston from my father, my uncle, and
Mr. Ternant, who was in the band with my
uncle.” Of course, they all told the same “ old
story.” Naturally they stuck up for their regi-
ment, simply because the rank-and-file of the New
South Wales Corps was as much implicated in the
rebellion as Major Johnston himself. Henry
Ikin adds iartistically: “'} hey all loved the
major.” Of course they did. He secured to them
a monopoly of the private still business and they
were grateful. The unsophisticated Ikin goes on
to say that Major Johnston “ was willing to
make any sacrifice to save the country from
ruin.” Ihis child-like faith is touching in the ex-
treme, but we are terribly afraid the gallant
Major doesn’t deserve it —
I believe that what we have seen in print lately, traducing
the charac er cf Majjr Johnston, has been coriedfrom
s'utements the production of Governor Bligh and his par-
ticular friendi’.
jSh! no doubt, but. unfortunately, these state-
ments were recorded as evidence which was con-
sidered so conclusive that only high influence
etterfCd dn behalf of the Major saved his life. The
defence set up by Mr. Ikin is a 1 so very one-sided.
HC says
But my aocour t is from'soldiers .in the same regiment as
himself —(Majnr JOhnSton)—and who could haV- no object
in giving a false representation to the facts referred to. .
I have waited patiently to see if forn« oln native whose an-
cestors were connected with the 102 ad Regiment . . .
would give a truthful statement, etc;, but, not having found
one, I have done my best, and felt it a duty, not only cut of
respect to the memory of Major Johnston, but also to the
memory of my honoured father and uncle, whom I rover
knew to tell an untruth.
Considering the stake played for, there Is nodmbt
the soldiere of Johnston’s regiment were very
grateful to him. For a season his coup d'etat bol-
ste r ed up the odious rule of Ihe New Fouth Wales
Corps, which Bligh hid unceasingly fought
against. The colony of New South V ales owes
much to the Muff old sea-dog, for with the arrival
of Governor Macquarie-— whom nobody considers
it safe to attack— iligh’s regime of hostility to
the rule of the rum-monopolists was revived, and
their power for ever crushed, though, unfortu-
nately, not entirely eradicated. r t heir descendants
still govern in official circles, and the laws framed
by them for convicts are seemingly effectually
riveted on to the necks of a free people.

The Story of Mary Wilson.
On the 4th January last, when dukes and other
hereditary loafe s were just finishing up the
Christmas festivities, someone fell heavily over
the dead body of Mary Wilson, who was
spread out loose on the steps of a Loud n
church with no boots cn her feet and an
empty physic-bottle in her hand. Mary’s soul
had taken flight, and her mortal remains being
fished out of the snow end itques'ed, it was
found that she had fled across the Styx by
her own act in a moment of temporary de ange-
ment. Her dea'h saves the burdened taxpayer
the sum of £26 per annum. Years ago, the de-
ceased had a luxurious home in a London suburb
where she lived with her son, and in those days
she had as many boots as she wanted, and used to
lie on a sofa instead of on a doorstep. Then the
son died intestate, leaving property valued at
£BOOO, and it was discovered that his mother had
not been married until after he was born, and the
poor old woman being unable to make out
any legal claim upon the assets the property
was annexed by the State in the ordinary
course of law. While the money was lying at the
credit of the Pre Eminent in Grief, Mrs Wilson
led a precarious existence in ash-barrels and
empty tanks ; her own fderds, the conventional
“ Christians ’ of the present day, all went back on
her upon discovering that her early morals had
not been so good as they ought to have been, and
it took her all she knew to raise an occasional
postage-stamp with which to write to Victoria,
by the Grace of God, and ask her if she couldn’t
let her have a little of her son s money to beep her
from starving. At last these appeals bore fruit,
ftnd a letter was delivered at the boiler on the
Wharf, where Mary Wilson was temporarily
residing, by which she learned that a pension
Of 10s. a week (or £26 a year, though the interest
On £BOOO at 3 per cent, is £240 per annum) had
been gfaciously conferred upon her. Thanks to
this timely assistance, the o!d ladovas enabled to
take a room in a back-street and co lay in a table
and a second-hand chair, and then in the after-
noons she used to sit at the window and gaze out on
the washerwomen fighting in the yard and lovingly
reflect on her Sovereign’s goodness But, unluckily,
she had acquired a taste for sinful luxury when
living in that suburban villa, and, instead of
mortifying the flesh, she gave way to dissipa-
tion and spent her fourteenpence a day in
riotous living, and even indulged in coals. In
consequence of this wild extravagance she fell
behind with her rent, and at the festive season
she got the key of the street. Then she tried to
hold out in tanka and ash-barrela until the next
10s. would be due, but it was snowing heavily,
and she grew tired of it. Her table and chair had
been seized ; her son was dead; her old home had
been sold up by the Government of the Empress
of India; and she had no boots or stockings ; and,
after sizing all these things up, she borrowed a
little bottle of laudanum and went to sleep.

The Shepherds Who Shear Their Sheep.
The Australasian contains about half a column
concerning on the death cf the hevd. Dr. MacKin-
non of Strath, in the island of Skye, the repre-
sentative of the last of three generations of that
name who have since 1777 occupied a manse at
Strath. 1 hal this last minister was an une'e to
Lachlan MacKinnon, the rufous manager of the
Argus, accounts for the prominence given to the
phrase that by this death was broken another
“ link which hound the honored name of MacKin-
non to the cradle and home of their race.” It is
a pity for the interests of journalism that any of
these Macs, ever got farther than their cradles,
but you never found one of them who got a
chance of leaving his home ever return. Lachlan
MacKinnon, the absentee proprietor of the
Argus, hasn t gone back to the cradle of his race
—he lives in Devonshire, This Dr. MacKinnon,
who is just dead, and who, according to the Aus-
tralasian, “loved his people, and they loved
him,” was, for nearly 50 years, in possession of the
Glebe lands and tithes of Strath, deriving there-
from a fat income without having a congregation
of half-a-dozen. The people of Strath and of all
Skye belong to the Free Church of Scotland, and
will not worship in the Established Kirk. It is a
crying shame that for 111 years these reverend
Mackinnons should have lived on the poor people
of Strath. Little wonder that the Crofters are
discontented when such a state of things has
existed. Little wonder that, under the manage-
ment of a Mackinnon, the Argus and Australa-
Sian have become Tory rags out of touch with all
the sympathies of the people of Victoria ; but
even Scotch obstinacy ought to yield to the over-
whelming testimony of a fallen prestige. Whils
David Symk is day by day becoming richer ant
the age is a power which can make and nnmate
ministries, the A rocs is daily losing political
power and has now no influence except, per
chance, with the Government House “push,” t
whom the Jbameses and Jenkinses of the pape
love to grovel.
The New York Times recently headed a cable
gram concerning Cardinal Manning “ Dr
M'Glynn's New Ally the New York Tribune
headed its cablegram in re the same subject, “ Ai
Anarchist Cardinal.” The following, from a re
cent article by Cardinal Manning, in the Fort
nightly, occasioned all the bother“ The obliga
tion to feed the hungry springs from the natura
right of every man to life and to the food neces
ssry for the sustenance of life, go strict is this
natural right that It prevails over all positive laws
of property. Necessity has no law, ant a starving
man has a natural right to his neighbour's
breast." Who will dare to say that Cardinal
Manning is not right ?
Mulhall’s “Dictionary of Statistics” states that
in Great Fritain and Ireland there are 47,646,000
acres of pasture and arable land. On this the
landlord levies an annual rent of £1 4s. per acre,
and the tenant, “ in fa ! r years,” ma v es 4s. per
acre. In other words, the land-thief who does no
work and serves- no useful purpose on earth, gets
over £58,000,000, be the seasons good or bad,
while the toiler, but for whom the land would be
worthless, t he landlord a beggar, and the nation
ruined, mates a little over £10,000,000 on the
comparatively rare occasion! when ho reaps a
goed harvest, and in bad years his income sinks
down to the vanishing point—which, in England,
means the bailiff, frllo wed by the workhouse. If the
land is ever uDe ly abandoned by the people, Eng-
land wid be a desert, and, meanwhile, the agricul-
turists —the only real producers of a nation —pay
£58,000,000 annually for the privilege of saving
the nation from extinction !
“ Mr. Chisholm Gray is in Sydney col-
lecting material for his grandmother's biography,
and wid be glad if anyone who can give him in-
formation calculated to be of service in the work
will communicate with him at the Reform Club.”
Many people may be tempted to ask what have we
to do with Mr. Gray’s grandmother ? Well, she
was known half a century ago as Mrs Caroline
Chisholm, the “ Emigrant’s Friend.” Mr. Gray
is eon of Edmund D *yer Gray, ex-Lord Mayor of
Dublin, a pronounced Nationalist, member of Par-
liament for the St. Stephens’ Green Division of the
City of Dublin, aid a leading proprietor of the
Freeman’s Journal published in that oity. Mr.
Gray fa grandson of Sir John Gray, the
compatriot of O’Connell and one of six who
went to gaol with O’Connell and Gavan
Duffy in 1844, The Interest Australians may
take in him, however, is centred in the fact
that he is grand-nephew to Wilson Gray, who, a
generation ago, assisted largely to shape the poli-
tical inies of the colony of Victoria. Wilson
Gray, a graduate of Trinity Colega, Dublin, and
a barrister-at law, arrived in Melbourne in '36, in
the same ship that brought Gavan Duffy, and
while the latter was assisted by the Irish residents
—there were no native statesmen then, as the
colony was still in its teens—who purchased a
property which qualifled him for a seat In Parlia-
ment, Gra> was content with a seat in that ot her Par-
liament which met in the Assembly Hotel, Spring-
street, and was known a i the Victorian Convention.
The discovery cf gold in the Southern colony
caused an influx of a sturdy, resolute class of men
who soon made their Influence felt, men who, aa
was shown at the Eureka Stockade in 1854, were
not afraid to risk liberty and life in helping to
build up a free and independent nation. When
the gold fever cooled, these men who had deter-
mined to make the colony their home had to find
fresh scope for their industry, and naturally
looked to the broad Crown lands ot the country
as a proper means ot subsistence. Parliament was
deaf to the urgent appeals of the people, and
thinking men founded the “ Convention,” a body
of delegates from all parts of the colony who de-
bated the measures before Parliament, the princi-
pal of which was the Land Bill. Wilson Gray
was one of the most prominent members of the
Amateur Parliament—a body which taught the
science of legisla'ion to many who have since in-
scribed their names upon the Parliamentary roll
cf the colony. Later on, when property-qualifi-
cation was abolished, Wilson Gray entered Parlia-
ment as member for Rodney, and was always
found fighting on the side of the people. When
t*e land question was settle 1 in a sort of way Mr.
Gray betook him t o New Zealand where he ob-
tained a District Court Judgeship, in which posi-
tion he died a few years ago. Mrs. Caroline
Chisholm has a son in N.S.W.—formerly a clerk
in the office of the Minister of Justice— a captain
in the Highland Volunteers, who now bolds the
position of Police Magistrate at Yass

Some European ladies, passing through
Constantinople, paid a visit to a certain high
Turkish functionary. The host offered them re-
freshments, Including a great variety of sweet-
meats, always taking care to give one of the
ladles double the quantity he gave the others.
Flattered by this marked attention, she put the
question through the interpreter, * ‘ Why do you
serve me more liberally than the rest?” “Be-
cause you have a larger mouth," was the straight-
forward answer.

A Special Invitation.
We especially invite a trial by all those sufferers
from Kidney and Liver complaints who have
failed to obtain relief from other remedies and
from doctors. Nature’s great remedy— dr. bell’s
bitters— has effected cures in many obstinate
cases. It acts at once on the kidneys, liver and
bowels, cleansing the system of all poisonous
humors, and restoring a healthy condition of those
Important organs. Do not be discouraged, but
try it. *
You cannot do better, if you feel dull and languid, and
out of sorts generally, than to try Dunstone’s Compound
Essence of Dandelion. A few doses will brace up the
nerves, clear the brain, and make you feel fit and well. A
perfect blood purifier and strengthener of the whole system.
Read testimonials wrapped with each bottle as to the mar-
vellous efficacy of this preparation. A sure cure for all Liver
and Kidney Disorders, as well as Gout, Rheumatism,
Sciatica, and all Nervous Diseases. Sold by all Druggists
at 5s. per bottle. Wholesale agents: Elliott Bros, Ltd-,
Sydney,
William's Australian Insecticide is death to all insects.
Simple in application—sure In effect. This is the only genuine
Insect Destroying Powder, being certain death to all kinds
of insects, while it is perfectly harmless to animal life, and
therefore may be used without the slightest apprehension.
For the extermination of Mosquitos especially, the Insecti-
cide has no equal—as the fumes of the burnt powder, while
throwing off a pleasant odour, ate at the same time most
destructive to them. Sold in Is. boxes by all chemists and
storekeepers. Manufactured only by W. Williams,
Pharmaceutical Chemist, 257 King-street, Newtown. Whole-
sale from Messrs Elliott Bros, and E. Prosser & Co.*
Luxuriant Glossy Hair —To obtain this, avoid
poisonous hair restorers and dyes, and use Rowlands’
Macassar Oil, known for nearly 100 years as the best pre-
server, strengthener, and beautifier of the hair. Sold also in
a golden colour for fair-haired ladies and children. Row-
lands’ Kalydor removes freckles, tan, cutaneous erup-
tions, and produces a beautiful complexion. Ask dealers in
perfumery for Rowland s articles, of 20, Hatton Garden,
London.*
ALMOST YOUNG AGAIN.
My mother was afflicted a long time with neuralgia and a
dull, heavy inactive condition of the whole system ; head-
ache, nervous prostration, and was almost he'pless. No
pbync'ans or medicines did her any good. Three months ago
she began to use Dr. Soule’s American Hop Bitters, with
such good effect that she seems and feels young again,
although over 70 years old. We think there is no other medi-
cine fit to use in the family.—A lady in Providence, R.I.—
“Journal.”
GET OtJT DOORS
The close confinement of all factory work, gives the opera*
lives pallid faces, poor appetite, languid, miserable feelings,
poor blood inactive liver, kidney and urinary troubles, and
all the physicians and medicine in the world cannot help
them unless they get out of doors or use Dr. Soule s Ameri-
can Hop Bitters, the purest and best remedy, especially for
such cases, havirg abundance of health, sunshine and rosy
cheeks in them. They cost but a trifle. See another column
—" Christian Recorder.”
A Boon to Humanity.— In 1844 a therapeutical inven-
tion v as brought before the world, which surprised everyone,
in that it dispelled, modified or lessened Pain, the charac-
teristic symptom of nearly all diseases. The inventor made
no secret of his Discovery, although at the time Scepticism
raised her head, and people loudly acclaimed it was im-
possible that a single medicine could arrest Pain of every
kind, and core a variety of diseases tuGh, however, was the
fact when Mr. Richard Freeman placed in the hand of the
public his Genuine Chl< rodyne. Tear by year its cosmo-
politan popularity has increased, till it is niw f und in every
quarter of the globe and thousands dally, in New Zealand
and other lands, express their gratitude and sens® of security
from the use of this medicine.—Sold everywhere throughout
the Colonies. Insist upon having ‘•Freeman’s'’ only.

Children starVI kg to death on account of their in-
ability to digest food, will find a most marvellous food and
remedy in Scott's Emulsion of Pure Cod Liver Oil
with Hypo phosph ites. Very palatable, and easily
digested. Read the following testimonial: "I have pre-
scribed ‘ Scot!' s Emulsion’ in oases of children suffering
from wasting and mal-nutrition, and can report most favour-
ably of its good effect; it has been in each case taken most
readily.— W. Perkins, M.R C.S., Medical Superintendent,
Burleigh Hospital, England.” Any chemist can supply it at
4s 63.
A Popular Fallacy.
Many people think that rheumatism cannot be
onred. It is caused by a bad state of the blood,
which deposits poisonous matter in the joints and
muscles, causing lameness stiffness and swelling
of the joints, and excruciating pains, dr, bell’s
(Kidney and Liver) bitters will certainly effect a
cure. They act on the kidneys, liver and bowels,
stimulating them to a healthy action, purifying
and enriching the blood and eliminating the poison
from the system. Go to the nearest druggist, buy
dr. bell’s bitters, and be cured.

plant known.
Persons suffering from Skin Disease wUI find
these Bitters invaluable.

With thanks for forwarding me a bottle of you

excellent, and superior to many others that 1 have
previously tried.
Yours faithfully,
HENRY CHARLES CURTIS,

Port Adelaide, October 80 1886.
Gentlemen,—l have great pleasure in recom-
mending Row's Dandelion Bitters. I have been
suffering for several years with Liver complaint,
and been under several doctors for It without any
curative result. I have only taken two bottles of
you Dandelion Bitters, and feel quite a different
man. I can, therefore, with truthfulness, advise
all who suffer from Liver complaint to try them,—
Yours,
0. R. UPJOHN. J.F,
Tamworth, August 81, 1886.
Read an expression of thankfulness received by
the undersigned t —
“ I have for many years been obliged to take
medicines of different kinds for affections of the
liver, Indigestion, pain In the chest, general de-
bility, feelings of nervousness, weariness, great
depression of spirits, and so on, but all without
producing any beneficial effect, till at last, being
recommended to try ROW’S DANDELION
BITTERS, which, happily, I find has produced an
unexpected and wonderful effect and change In
my system, and has removed from my mind the
horribly depressed feeling and former condition of
bodily ailment 1 have so unhappily experienced
for so many years.

A valued correspondent writes to The
Bulletin enquiring why the clergy name all their
churches after saints, while hotels are named
after animals and all sorts of things? He wants
to know distinctly why a place of worship should
not be called the “Spotted Dog ’’ or the “Lion,” j
and why a tavern should not be St. Barnabas’ pub.
We reply candidly and cheerfully that we don’t
know;
The S.M. Herald in a recent leader pain-
fully confesses that ‘ 1 Despite the humanising and
refining influences of civilisation the old leaven
of unfairness still lingers in our mode of treating
women." Now, that just proves how misleading
appearances are ! We would have staked our
boots; if necessary, that women —especially old
women—were the Herald’s special 4 ' line."
Editor Bulletin. Sir, —To convince my
fellowmen, and particularly the Australians, of
the deplorable condition of the world at the pre-
sent time, and to show them that it is possible for
us to gain a knowledge of the past ages of this
world by reflections upon the great law of Nature
or God, I beg to make the following prediction —
viz.—That Australia will be visited scon by a
great earthquake which will discover relics of a
past ago of the world, in which its inhabitants
were in a similar state of civilisation to that of
ours at the present time. After this predicted
earthquake occurs, I trust the public will have
sufficient confidence in me to hear me farther,
when I hope to be able to tell them some things
that will ba of use to them. But as would
not listen to the late Leo Hausmann Planla, it
would be folly for ma to expect them to listen to
me until this earthquake does occur. I send a
copy of this to each of the following editors for
publication, viz. :—Editor Age, Melbourne ; editor
Adelaide Observer ; editor Brisbane Telegraph,
who, I trust, will, as well as yourself, publish
this, if not before, immediately after the earth-
quake predicted occurs, and, if possible, bafore
the result of the eruption is known, as far as
relics are concerned.--1 am, &(*., James Miller.
Mooloolah, N.S.W. February 27, 1888. [We
have much pleasure in hereby appointing Mr.
Miller as Head Prophet in Ordinary to The
Bulletin.—Ed. B.]
Few people are aware of the alarming prevalence
of Kidney and Liver diseases, especially among
those who have arrived at or past middle age. It
is declared on good authority that fully one-half
the deaths in this country are either directly or
indirectly the result of Kidney cr Liver disease of
some sort. 1
A great majority of men above 40 years of age
are afflicted with some sort of affection of the
Kidneys or Bladder, and these diseases are on the
increase. Persons are often seriously affected
before they know of it themselves, and thus these
insidious disorders get a good foothold before any-
thing is done to dislodge them.
Dropsy, Gravel, Diabetes, Bright's disease, In-
continence, Debility, Catarrh of the Bladder,
Albumenuria, &c., are among the many forms of
these diseases. Most of these are very difficult to
cure, defying the powers oftentimes of the best
physicians obtainable, and are pronounced by
many to be incurable.
Physicians state that many forms of Kidney and
Liver disease are very difficult to detect, as in
diseases of this form oftentimes there are no
symptoms of a marked nature. This is one of the
reasons why they are so difficult to cure.
Dr. Bell's Kidney and Liver Bitters is a specific
for Kidney and Liver troubles. Bladder and
Urinary diseases, Dropsy, Gravel, Diabetes, and
all of that class of disorders.
It cures Biliousness, Headaches, Jaundice, Liver and
Stomach troubles, Dispepsia, Constipation, and Piles
It cures Intemperance, Nervous diseases, General Debility,
Female Weaknesses and excesses.
It is thoroughly reliable, hiehly recommended, works
Dronin' ly, relieves at once, and was never known to fail.
TESTIMONIALS.
Gents.—I have been troubled with Kidney disease; there
was also fluttering of the heart—palpitation, I suppose—
and I hart to lie very quiet after going to bed. At last I
thought I would try a bottle of your bell's bitters I
purchased some at Bedford, and took the medicine as
directed, and after using one bottle, I felt no more of the
flattering heart I got another bottle, and had to take only
one-half of it to be cured. My daughter was similarly
troubled; had no appetite ; could not sleep at night. I gave
her my half remaining bottle, and she rests as well as ever.
There is no trouble with my kidneys now. I shall keep
your medicine on hand
October, 1886. William Ritter.
Gentlemen—I have been troubled ever since I was a child
with Headaches of a nervous character, and my mouth was
full of canker sores—so bad, indeed, that I could not eat;
nor could I test at night. At last I tried your bell’s
bit i ers, and two bottles have brought me out all right, and
I now feel like a new person. „
October 29.1886 Mrs. C. Rose.
The Courier’s late office in Queen-street,
Brisbane, is now occupied by an se thetic China
man, who advertises well.
Mr. R. Spencer Browne, once editor of a
Cocktnwn paper, has seemingly lost his wife, one
of the rro3t charging young ladies who ever
adorned Brisbane society. One account re calved
from Colombo spates that Mrs. Browne was dead ;
another that she had disappeared ; and still yet
another states that she is in Colombo awaiting
her father, the Rev. J. Sutton, who has gone out
by the Jumna with Mrs. Sutton, Mr. Spencer
Browne is said to be on his way home by himself.
Down in Tasmania the path of him who
dodges the gentleman with the long tail and the
hoofs is Strewn with spikes. There was a drought
in the neighbourhood of Hobart some little time
ago, ard when at last things got down so low that
the public were compelled to wash in saucers, a
Sunday was set apart on which the whole popula
tioa was to pray for something to lay the dust.
The services were impressive—in one rural church
particularly so, and j ast as the plate was about to
go round the agricultural worshippers became
suddenly aware of’a soft sound llKe water on the
roof. It grew louder and sloshed round with in-
creased vehemence ; the faith of the congregation
arose to bursting point, and the man who sat
underneath the leak in the roof had to snake
himself out of the track of the refreshing
stream ; the -bojs in the street hollered
with excitement ; and then the row grew
louder stll', and the goats outside could be
heard audibly wallowing in the cooling element.
The service closed hastily with a few well-chosen
remarks about the efflcaoy of prayer, and the
congregation went out to view the scene. The
man who got out first said “ Damn 1 ’ and the un-
holy cuss echoed through the sacred edifice.
There wasn’t a cloud in the sky. The ther-
mometer had risen to 120 In the shade, and was
hanging on because It was too weak to rise any
higher. The dust was driving along in clouds,
and a big larrikin with a head like an evergreen-
tree was playing a hose on the roof.

CHAPTER I.
“ I was taken sick a year ago
With bilious fever."
“My doctor pronounced me cured, but I got
sick again, -with terrible pains in my back and
tides, and I got so bad I
Could not move!
I shrunk!
From 2281bs. to 120 1 I had been doctoiing for
my liver, but it did me no good, I did not ex-
pect to live more than three months. I began to
use Dr. Soule’s American Hop Bitters. Directly
my appe-ite returned my pains left me, my entire
system seemed renewed, as it by msgio tnd after
using several bottles, I am nob only as sound as
a soverign, but weigh more than I did before. To
Hop Bitters I owe my life.”

The Referee.
The brothers Kennedy, Johnson, Bros,
Brodle, Dobson, Frase”, and Martin, with Kloster
and Payne as emergenc es, are Individually a fair
lot to represent N.S.W. in the Intercoh nUI eight-
oar race, but ocllec Ively a want of unanimity and
first class coaching presage an almost certain
defeat. The public find the money for these con-
tests, and It Is time they knew how they were re-
presented. The last crew who went to Melbourne
quarrelled all through their training. One wanted
bis dinner In the middle of the day, another
thought evening the best time for his gorge ; the
boat was never put in the water without enough
cursing to sink a ship, and, when afloat, the crew
could be heard fault-finding and bickering by
strollers on the river-bank. How differant the
Victorians ! Each man knew his place, tbe boat
was launched, the men tcor their seats without
a murmur, and the eight darted away like a piece
of machinery. Four out of the present eight have
been persuaded to take seats after refusing when
first asked, which means that the first tiff will see
them threatening to leave the crew, as the Asso-
ciation have acknowledged by running after them
that a crew cannot he formed without them.
Then, as to the matter of coaches —Messrs. P. J.
Clark an- 7 C. Perry. Two coach s are a farce on
the face of it, as they may have different opinions
m to style, and one may tell the men one day wha
the other will growl at the next. Mr. Ferry h*s
not had sufficient experience in eight-oar rowing,
and Mr. Clark, who has, is too heavy to hawk
round as coxswain in a racing eight, and is not

likely to have the time or Inclination to go
out often with the crew. Mr. Oatley the
writer looks upon as the best coach the
colony can produce, and his past success and the
trouble he has taken on previous occasions cer-
tainly entitled him to the refusal of the post. At
least two good men besides the eight should be
taken over and kept In equal trim with the crew,
so that, in the event of threats to leave the boat,
the growlers might be at once packed back and
their places taken by the emergencies. Year after
year sees the race thrown away by reason of
petty bickerings and want of Association back
bone, and subscribers may as well know that
they are wasting good money in sending these
quarrelling crews to misrepresent New South
Wales on Victorian waters.

The name of the second horse in the New-
market Handicap is Lord Ullen, not Lord Allen,
and those Scotchmen who were In the swim
backed him. Lochiel won the race last year, and
superstitious Soots thought they had the race
mortgaged again.

The “bike” men still remain firm In
their determination to stop gM«si-profesßionallsm,
an attempt to remove the disqualification from C.

The two English Elevens have succeeded
In cutting one another’s throats. Lillywhite and
company, up to the present, are £l5OO to the bad;
whilst Vernon’s Eleven have so far put the
M.C.C. In to the tune of between £2500 and £3OOO.
Offers were made at the outset to Indemnify
Lillywhite against loss, which were declined. In
lace of the heavy losses, however, the Cricket
Association might well forego their 5 per cen*-., as
they are not In want of funds, and Lilly whit a has
ever shown himself to be a thorough sportsman.

The Giffens, after all, would appear to be
about getting their price from the Australian

A good Idea of the show Mr. Buck would
have made against the N.S.W. champion amateur
boxer may be taken from the Britisher s show
against Yankee Costello In Melbourne on Satur-
day night. Costello, the ether evening, had all
the worst of his meeting with Mr.
whilst, from the beginning of his bout with Mr.
Burk, the American punished hla men heavily
and continued to make a ohopplng-blocK of him
until the police stopped the proceedings in the fifth
round.

The amateurs travelling with Lilly white’s
team are to be ca’led upon to show cause why
they should not be classed as professionals, on the
ground that they are forming part of agate-money
combination. We hear nothing, however, of the
heavlly-snbsldised gentlemen of Vernon’s team.

At the Y.R.C. races, on Saturday, the
Hon Jas. White continued his unprecedented run
of luck by winning the All-Aged Stakes with
Cranbrook, who won in a canter from Lady Betty.
Alphlngton defeated Gentian in the Unplaced Two-
year-old Handicap ; Ruby won the Steeplechase;
and the Hon. White again chipped in by winning
the Loch Plate with Carlyon. The Place Handi-
cap fell to Ben Bolt; and The Charmer appro-
priated the Farewell Handicap.
* * *
Dr. Grace’s record is without douht the
most brilliant of any cricketer that ever lived.
He has made over 50,000 runs, which means he
has run over 600 miles of ground to obtain these
runs. He has made 100 runs In an innings more
than 130 times; 200 runs 12 times; 300 runs
thrice, and once ho made 100 runs. His advice to
young players ought to be framed and hung up
In every club-room: “ Play with a free and up-
right bat; be not anxious about scoring at the
first; keep your eye well on the ball; the left
shoulder kept well forward and the left elbow
naturally well up; stand upright, with the top
of the handle of the bat just above your belt, and
the blade almost on a level with the middle
stump.”
• * *
“Tattersall” was fined not long since
for promoting a so-called Consultation, but he
still carries on his “ sweeps” on all big horse and
foot races, that for the recent Newmarket Handi-
cap being for no less a sum than £lO,OOO. He
advertises in almost every paper in the various
colonies, so It cannot be that the police are un-
aware that the sweeps are still carried on. The
“ traps," however, didn't take long to stamp out
Mr. “ Barb " and his little affair.

This from the Argus report of Newmarket
Handicap Day at Flemington;—“Down Ih the
paddock the bookmakers were plying business
with earnestness enough to make up for time lost
at Moonee Va ley on Thursday, when they went
on strike rather than pay a fee for doing business.
The fraternity, too, seemed all the heartier for
their rest.” Great Scott! One would Imagine
that odds laying was like brick laying. “Their
rest," forsooth I

The noble art plays a lone hand on this,
A telegram in Melbourne Leader of 9th Feb.,
says “Mr. Slavln defeated Mr. Laing for repre-
sentation in Parliament of Wanganui, N.Z." Is
this some oold-bloodei chestnut, or do they really
mean It?

The Sullivan and Mitchell fight, last
Saturday, in France, seems to have been a desperate
one, according to the only authentic cable received
in Sydney. It lasted three hours, and ended In
a draw after 39 rounds, each man having an arm
and several ribs broken I This effectually dis-
poses of the long-prevalent Idea that no man on
earth could stand before J. L. Sullivan for six
rounds.

“ Don’t forget that Carlyon Is the best of
White’s horse?, and will, all being well, start
first favourite for th« Australian Cup,” said The
Bulletin some weeks ago. Yet no other paper
in the colonies tipped Carlyon to get a place in
the Cup, or even suggested that the colt could
beat Nelson for the Eesendon Stakes.

When prizs-fightlng was in its golden
prime, the articles and necessary arrangements
of a merry mill were drawn up in the back par-
lour of a pub., for men were mostly godless In
those days. But we note with pleasure that two
amateur pugs, of Footecray (Melb.) fixed up their
little affair at a Salvation Army meeting, under
cover of a capting’s “ hernest hexortatlon to all
bretheilng present." As a police-report put it—
“ The men, with their companions, while within
hearing of those conducting the religious service,
arranged the preliminaries of a fight.” In point
of fact they arranged It over their Bibles, just as
Emperor William and Moltke mapped out their
invasion of France. (Voices from the platform
and back seats alternately.)—
“ Repent while there is time, my brother! ”
“ G'on, yer ! you're another.”
“ Where will you go to when you die)"
“ I’ll wipe yer in the bloomin’ eye."
“ To Hell, dear friends, without a doubt.”
“ S'help me, come and have it out,”
“ O ! my brethring, fire a volley,”
“ 111 put my bit on Joe, by golly 1"
“ And let us seek the Loard to night.”
“ Fred’s a hot ’un with his right.”
“He’s the sinner’s only hope."
“ Ready ? Right yer are—let’s slope."
The aforementioned mill was conducted in a ker-
rlstian spirit on the quiet side of the Saltwater
River, and Heaven saw that It was good. Both
principals were pummelled into pulp, after which
the least pulpy one took up a collection for the
! weaker vessel, and the meeting sang a hymn and
slowly dispersed. Even prize-fighting is becom-
ing purified by the all-powerful Influence of
religion.

They say that several of the “ books ” got
a severe knock last week.

In the England v. Australia match at
Melbourne, Attewell took 12 wickets for 48, and
he followed this up with six wickets for 80 in the
first Innings of Victoria, At the present moment,
Lehmann, Attewel', Briggs, and Preston (although
neither of them so gacd as Turner) form a quar-
tette of bowlers against which no team In the
world could hold out for longer than a day. And
yet a lot of old women talk about widening the
wickets to give the poor bowlers a chance !
* • •
Hales’ latest Flemington record was some-
thing to make a note of. Riding In 15 races he
scored 11 wins and one tight second, and a sove-
reign invested on all his mounts brought a net
profit of £25 11s. at starting prices. The popular
verdict was that marriage has agreed with
Thomas.
• * •
Mr. White relied on Abercorn in the
Champion because he was determined to win the
race with a horse of his own breeding. After the
chestnut had romped in owner and jockey shook
hands, as they did over the victories of Volley,
Cranbrook, and Oarlyon.
• * •
Hales’ finest finish at the Y.R.C. meeting
was on Ambition, whom the Inoky man fairly
lifted home In the last stride. By the way, they
dfg
do say that Hales Is so closely Identified with the
nominator of Ambition (Mr. W. S. Mackenzie)
that you can hardly tell t’other from which.

No wonder international cricket goes flat
In Melbourne. Not since Ivo Bligb’s visit has any
British eleven been beaten on the M.C.C. ground.

It is hinted that the Britishers were
bowling soft, with an eye to next day’s gate, when
Blaokham and Jones whacked up 50 runs In 27
minutes last Friday afternoon.
