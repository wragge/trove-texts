The Theatre
Here are two delightful critics of the
theatre: W. R. Titterton, in From Theatre
to Music Hall (Swift, per Sydney Book
Club) ; and John Palmer, in The Future of
the Theatre (Bell, 2s. 6d ., per W. Dymock,
Sydney). Titterton is audaciously destruc-
tive, Palmer cheekily constructive ; the for-
mer deplores the present maladies of the
stage, the latter suggests their cure. Titter-
ton is cheerfully trivial—his outlook that of
the avefage man; Palmer is the expert
critic, optimistically constructing his par-
ticular theatre of the future.
Titterton deplores the extinction of the
English hero, the failure of action, (he cine-
matograph, and finds in “The Drift to the
Halls” the only sign of vitality on the stage.
It is in the music-halls that he is most at
home, and he gives brilliant snapshots of
■London music-hall favorites. Always he is
out-spoken, stimulating and cock-sure.
Drama is born of the clash of tempera-
ment against its temperamental environ-
ment ; yet the fidgets of a nervous man in
an unbleached shirt are not neeessarilv
diamatic. One is led to the employment of
tnis metaphor* by a contemplation of the
modern problem play, for the modern prob-
lem play impresses me as the fidgets of a
nervous man in an unbleached shirt.... The
pantomimic dramas of Reinhardt and the
Kussmns are Wilde coming home to roost...
Wilde perfected epigrammatic dialogue, and
thus destroyed it; after him it could only be
a looking back.
You will notice how, in typical modern
plays, the action peters out; how romantic
make-believe fails, how epigrammatic make-
believe fails, how problems fail, how realism
tails, how the poor plot feels blindly for a
hold, grips nothing, 'and falls inert with the
rail of the first or the second curtain!
fehaw s last act is almost always a bad one.
All the dramatic interest of Arms and the
Man is contained in Raima’s bedroom.
vcesar and Cleopatra drools with the dis-
appearance of the Pyramid; the last acts of
Mrs. Warren and You Never Can Tell are
post-mortem reflections ; The Perplexed Hus-
band could not survive his own arrival; The
Admirable Crichton expired in the putting
off of his island kingship, What Every
Woman Knows with the election of John
ohand. Even Don, a promising comedy, has
no interest for us after he has put the wan-
dering damsel to bed.
In The Future of the Theatre, John
Palmer refuses to play for safety. “I have
decided simply to see what I would wish
to see.” The theatre of the future is the
theatre that John Palmer wants. And in
brilliant chapters he foretells the future of
dramatic critics—there won’t be any bv
1021, the future of the public, the future of
the producer—he will be extinct, the future
of repertory—it will be all repertory, the
future of the censor—the gallows, the
future of dramatic naturalism, the future of
Shaw—as to which we shall see later, and
finally the future of the drama.
First the dramatic critic, obiit 1921.
Dramatic criticism will be written by men
of leisure not, as journalism, in the hurried
small hours of the morning. - It will no
more be considered necessary by newspaper
proprietors to notice a play the morning
after production than it is considered neces-
sary to notice a book on the day of publica-
tion, and no more necessary to notice all
the plays than it is necessary to notice all
the books. And the National Memorial
Theatre —in which, by the way, Palmer sees
the knight that shall deliver the drama from
the dragon of to-day—will manage to do
without the critics at all.
The manager of the future will not give
the public what it wants, because, no more
than the manager of to-day, does he know
what it wants. He will give it what he
wants. . Shaw has never made the smallest
concession to the. public with the idea thereby
of making himself more popular and
agreeable; yet Shaw is one of the most
successful dramatists of the present day....
It is now being realised that the secret of
successful management is to give the public
the best in yojir power, confident that it is
safer to be too delicate or too profound than
not to be delicate or profound enough. Dur-
ing the last two years most of the really
successful plays were staged either experi-
mentally by enterprising fnen of mind or in
the regular way of production by managers
of the new school. Eliminate plays like
Runty Pulls the Strings and Rutherford and
Son (plays which slipped on to the com-
mercial stage by way of experimental
matinees) and plays like Milestones and
The Great Adventure (plays which were
produced by Denis Eadie and Granville
Barker) eliminate plays such as these, and
the average of financial success of the Lon-
don theatres is considerably reduced.
J*
Stanley Houghton’s Hindle Wakes was
first a repertory play, produced by Miss
Horniman. It and The Younger Generation
were great successes on the London stage:
they were certainly written without thought
of the public. Next Houghton wrote a play,
Trust the People, expressly for a London
manager—and the public. “All the ingredi-
ents of a really popular play were handled
with quite an astonishing neatness and
dexterity.” It failed.
It used to be said that' no play could
succeed on the English stage in which the
speeches were more than 10 lines long; that
no English audience could possibly endure a
play in which religion entered, or politics, or
social economy; .that no play could succeed
without a romantic love interest, a plot
which could not be described on half a
sheet of notepaper and a happy ending.
Already a large public has discovered it can
do without any of these things. Who taught
it to do without them?
Producers, our prophet says, are not a
necessity in the production of plays. They
are a fashionable luxury of the time. And
in the theatre of the future these middlemen
will disappear. The author will have mas-
tered stage conventions and technique; the
actor will know his job without the inter-
position of an interloper. What Palmer
terms the theatrical haberdasher will follow
the banished critic and the suppressed- pro-
ducer. Costumes should be inconspicuous;
they should not distract the attention of the
audience from the play—and modern cos-
tume design has exactly and expressly that
intention. “The principle of stagecraft in
the presentation of Shakespeare and the
poetic drama will be the conventionalising
and simplifying to the last possible degree
of all that merely subsidises the dramatic
appeal.” All that is necessary is a decent
framing of the picture.
As for Repertory, the tacit assumption
nowadays is that the only plays to be run
by a repertory theatre will be unsuccessful
plays. “The fact we have yet to grasp about
repertory theatres of the future is that their
difficulty will be, not in the unpopularity,
but in the popularity of their plays.” The
advantages of repertory to the public, the
actor and the author are put by Palmer
with convincing zest. The London National
Memorial- Theatre is to be a repertory
theatre; and its example and its success
with repertory is to be the leaven that will
leaven the box-office mind.
How will speculating managers learn to
resist the financial possibilities of a long
run? The National Theatre will pay its
way by repertory. It will get the best plays.
Other repertory theatres will open in imita-
tion. Players will perceive the advantages
of the new system. The repertory managers
will get the best talent, because they will
afford the actors better chances and more
frequent opportunities of showing their
powers. (Already we have seen this ten-
dency in Sydney. When the Repertory
Society set about getting a cast for its per-
formance of Mid-Channel, it was able to
pick the finest cast seen in Sydney for many
a year simply because good actors are
eager to play something better than—or
something different from—the fare provided
by the commercial managers.)
After all, Palmer finds that Shakespeare
is better than Shaw.
The reason why Shaw is inferior to
Shakespeare is pot that he chooses to give
to his people the illusion of being contem-
porary ratepayers, . whereas Shakespeare
chooses to give to his people the illusion of
being fairies, but (1) that Shakespeare’s
vision of life is more just than Shaw’s, (2)
that Shakespeare’s imaginative power is
greater than Shaw’s, (3) that Shakespeare
more, successfuly sustains the illusion that
Titania is a fairy than Shaw sustains the
illusion that Miss Whitefield is the woman
one meets in the Tube.... If Shakespeare
were to appear to-day, he would not be per-
formed at the Stage Society (probably the
few Shakespeare plays that passed the cen-
sor would be applauded by ignofant crowds
at Drury Lane, and the critics would dis-
cover his real quality from obituary notices
in the German newspapers).
As to dramatic naturalism. Palmer opines
that it is false to the English dramatic tem-
perament, and that once the English theatre
becomes really national, it is in the romantic
mold of Shakespeare, rather in the natu-
ralist mold of Ibsen, that its tempera-
ment will joyfully run.
The English dramatic renaissance so
far been an achievement that has come by
way of a protest. Shaw has protested most,
and,, in consequence, achieved most. “Hjs
soldiers who eat chocolate creams are a pro-
test against soldiers who ate fire.” Shaw
and his contemporaries have compiled a
literature of protest, a propaganda of de-
struction. Thus all these plays, whose
merits were temporarily valuable, but now
are negative, will perish. Yet Shaw, the
greatest offender of them all, will survive—
solely because of his intellectual buffoonery.
Shaw’s serious message for mankind would
be as tedious as the face of a chiding clock
were it not that he had a gift of literary ex-
pression second to no English dramatic
author (with the single exception of Wilde)
since Wycherley... .The immortal part of
Shaw is his wit..... The rest is a collection
of # moral and political ideas which are
neither important nor interesting so far as
the future of the English theatre is con-
cerned, and a method of dramatic presenta-
tion which has served its turn, and will
shortly be superseded.
A brilliant book, scintillating with ideas,
concealing an enthusiastic purpose beneath
a happy irresponsibility.
The Joyful Decline in the
Birth-rate
The Small Family System: Is it Injurious
or Immoral? by O. V. Drysdale (Fifield,
Is.), is not only an overdue counterblast to
Ueale s Racial Decay, but a needed appraise-
ment of the artificial restriction of births,
ard an exposure of the folly of those con-
servative minds who find in the falling birth-
rate a cause for bitter tears. One of the
most important points made by the author
io the obvious fact that the medical and
clerical opponents of family limitation do
not themselves carry out the principles they
profess. Just before the celebrated Ivnowl-
ton trial, which diffused throughout
the world knowledge of the facilities for
regulating births, the average number in the
families of both medical men and clergymen
was, on an average, just as high as‘that
of the remainder of the community. Now
it is obvious that both parsons and doctors
have much smaller families than those people
can least afford large families.
The Wowser croak that, artificial restric-
tion leads to physical and moral decadence
is met by the statement that in Australasia
there is more freedpm of access to such
means thap in most other countries, and
yet Australia and Maoriland, judged by their
low death-rate, and their rate of natural in-
crease, are the healthiest countries in the
world, whether regarded from the stand-
point of general or infantile morality.
According to the' statements of these
moralists, Australia and Maoriland should
compare with Sodom and Gomorrah in their
resolute determination to pursue a course of
iniquity. Yet we find them the most healthy
and prosperous countries of the world, cer-
tainly among the most virile.” The fact,
abundantly substantiated by statistics, is
that wherever there are high birth-rates
they are. accompanied by high rates of gen-
eral and infantile mortality, while low
birth-rates are accompanied by lower mor-
tality rates. There are only four countries
Whe world whefe the birth-rate lias risen
(Bulgaria, Ceylon, Japan and Ontario) ;
and in every one of the four the infantile
mortality has risen.
“In every case where the command to in-
crease and multiply has been obeyed bv
more rapid reproduction, the, whole power of
medical science has failed to prevent the
death-rate from rising.... It is difficult to
fid words adequate to deal with the attempt
of the medical profession to stem the tide of
the, declining birth-rate. If the aim of the
medical orofession is to allay suffering and
to prolong life, the facts show that the
whole nrofession is practically incompetent
to effect this for the community as a whole.
unless helped by family restriction The
most satisfactory improvement in the general
death-rate, the infantile mortality and the
stature of the people of any country in the
world has been shown in Holland, where
alone artificial restriction has been coun-
tenanced by the State, and taught to the
poorer classes with medical co-operation and
supervision.” The bogey of disease, once
put forward by the medical men—but not
put forward now—and that of immorality
advanced (but with increasing mildness) by
the clergy, as the result of these practices,
have been refuted by facts. “Artificial
sterilisation of matrimony is the most bene-
ficial of modern discoveries for the well-
being of the community,”
These facts, and the author’s deduction
therefrom, are worth pondering: "At the
present rate of progress the death-rate in
Great Britain will fall to 10 per 1000 (the
figure for Maoriland and Australia) by the
year 1921, if the birth-rate falls to 20 per
1000, as it appears likely to do. When that
time is reached it will mean that there is
practically no premature death from actual
ivant of the necessities of life, or, in other
words, that poverty in its worst sense is
abolished... .It is quite certain that this
result will be attained by 1921, even if no
greater efforts are made than at present. It
is equally certain that if the educated classes
of the community realised their duty in this
matter., and would help in bringing about
restriction of families in the places where it
is most required, the death-rate could be
brought down to 10 per 1000 within five
years. Yet during these five years there
would probably be a greater increase of
population than at present, since we should
be checking the supply of ineffectives rather
than that of effectives.”
A book that deserves a wide circulation,
especially among the parson and the Wow-
ser.
: «
Two beautiful color books of the year are
The Story of Chanticleer, adapted from Ros-
tand’s celebrated play, by Florence Yates
Hann (Heinemann; 65.). delightfully illus-
trated in color by J. A. Shepherd, and Prin-
cess Badourai a tale from the Arabian
Nights, retold by Laurence Housman, and
illustrated by Edmund Dulac (Hodder and
Stoughton, per Angus and Robertson, Svd-
ney). The latter is an exquisite example of
artistic design and modern color-printing.
Dulac’s paintings are quaintly Chinese in
feeling, and extraordinarily rich in color.
A Lesson in Grammar
The Commonwealth having acquired an
official historian, it must make the best of
him. The first thing is to teach him gram-
mar. The Beginnings of Government in
Australia, a series of lithographs taken from
the original documents, which the official
historian, Fredk. Watson, terms “the birth-
certificates of a nation,” is admirably pub-
lished by the N.S.W. Government Printer,
and authorised by the Library Committee of
the Federal Parliament. It can be bought
at Angus and Robertson’s and other book-
sellers. It contains documents relating to the
State, the Church, law, land, finance and
shipping. “With this volume the Library
Committee of the Parliament of the Com-
monwealth inaugurate the collected publica-
tions of the Historical Records of Aus-
tralia.”
The facsimile of these early documents has
a certain antiquarian interest; but the real
birth-certificates are missing. Copies of the
4ct constituting the colony. Phillip’s commis-
sions and instructions, and those- of the
Judge-Advocate should have been included
in this first series. But, even more neces-
sary was it that some public-school teacher
should have been detailed to attend daily
upon the Commonwealth Historian, yi order
to teach him the rudiments of grammar.
Fredk. Watson might have been asked, for
instance, to analyse the construction of this
.•sentence appearing in his preface: “The
mere individual romance of the papers them-
selves is a story in itself, some of them
drawn up, signed, and completed jn a tent
on the banks of the Tank Stream, pitched
amidst the virgin bush, which then occupied
the site of Sydney, and the careful preserva-
tion of them Through many vicissitudes to
the present day.” What verb, if any, would
be understood in that final phrase, and what
is that final phrase doing there, anyway V
Does Fredk. Watson mean: “The mere indi-
vidual roihance of the papers themselves, and
the careful preservation of them is a
story in itself”? And does Fredk. Watson
consider that sentence a model of construc-
tion for our official history?
The first line of his Introduction might
assist Fredk. Watson in his study of taut-
ology. His tutor might point to the phrase,
“The resultant distress caused thereby” as a
shocking example. Then Fredk. Watson
might be invited to study the rule that a verb
should have the same number as its substan-
tive. Several examples could be given in
which Fredk. Watson shows his originality
in. this respect. “ His Majesty's ship
‘Sirius,’ i which, with the tender ‘Supply,’
were detailed to convoy the fleet.” (Page 2.)
“The lands near what is now known as
Cook’s River and that at Point Sutherland
were considered the only possible localities
for headquarters. The former teas, however,
soon dismissed.” (Page 4.) “.... the en-
dorsements by Phillip and the evidence given
speaks volumes for the method of the day.”
(Page 14.) The following elegancy of style
might also have been profitably pondered by
Fredk. Watson : “.. . . the man-made gar-
dens of England to which the eyes of the
colonists were then alone accustomed to.
(Page 5.)”
Having thus acquired the rudiments of
grammar, Watson might be asked why, on
page 9, he speaks of “the definite and con-
crete step laying the keystones of law and
order,” when, obviously, he meant founda-
tion-stones; why on page 13 he speaks of a
man giving King’s evidence, when he pos-
sibly meant turning King’s evidence. Next
he might be invited to clear up the mystery
in the sentence on page 14: “On the western
side of the cove were grouped the two largest
clusters of tents, those of the men and
women convicts, some covered with boughs
seeking additional shelter from the weather
... .’’Were the convicts or the tents covered
with boughs? And, passing by his habit of
misplacing the word “only” (pages 16 and
IS), he might be set to work to reconstruct
such a sentence as this: “To the west of
the stream were pitched the marquees of the
officers and the tents of the marines, thrown
in relief bv numberless watch-fires and cooks’
fires, possibly the mess marquee glowing from
the candles of the officers breaking the tedium
of their existence by prolonging tjieir dinner.*”
Once Fredk. Wasson learns {n write the
English language he may prove an invalu-
able official historian.
The Cruise of the Snark, the little ketch
in which .Tack London roamed the Pacific
with his wife, is brilliantly narrated by the
owner (Mills and Boon, per Dymock’s
Library, Sydney). London set out for ad-
venture, and he got it. Sydney is mentioned
only as a place where London came to go
into hospital, and where the ill-health of
himself and his crew compelled him to end
his voyage.

be distinguished from that of the larger machines. It will write plainly and legibly
the work of authors, the sermons of preachers, the briefs of lawyers, and the regular
correspondence of a business man.
The BENNETT Typewriter may be operated by all the fingers of both hands,
and takes all sizes of paper up to 8| inches wide.
No Course of Instruction, no long hours of practice are necessary to master the
simple features of the BENNETT. The novice quickly learns the universal key-
board.
The BENNETT Typewriter, packed in a neat Leatherette Case, is 10 inches long,
5 inches wide, and 2 inches high, and weighs 5 pounds.
Every part of the BENNETT Typewriter is made of the best hardened steel, and
the most skilled labor furnishes the workmanship. The Type Face is identical with
the larger machines. The adjustment is accurate, and the type alignment is safe-
guarded by a special device.

A Picture of
Good HealtH!
Mrs. ADDINGTON, of Argent Street, Broken
Hill, writes her daughter was cured of St. Vitus’s
Dance, and is NOW IN SPLENDID HEALTH
through CLEMENTS TONIC.
“Argent Street, North Broken Hill,
“10th October, 1911.
“CLEMENTS TONIC LTD.
“Some years ago my daughter, in alighting from
a tram, had a severe fall. It gave her a great
shock, and so affected her nervous system that
eventually St. Vitus’s Dance ensued. She became
so bad that it was impossible to hold a knife or
fork, and going out of the house was impossible.
“I was persuaded to try CLEMENTS TONIC. She gradually improved, and
soon regained her normal condition. Nearly two years have elapsed SINCE LEit
COMPLETE RECOVERY, and all that time she has enjoyed the best of health.
“I have great faith in CLEMENTS TONIC, and always recommend it. You
can make what use you wish of this. »
“(Signed) (Mrs.) R. A. ADDINGTON”
CLEMENTS TONIC is Your MEDICINE
The Rev. JOHN HOSKING, D.D., Minister of
the Congregational Church, Fitzroy, Melbourne,
writes: —•
“I was completely run down and suffered by
nervous prostration, being troubled with Insomnia
and nervous headaches.
“After taking one bottle I slept soundly, and soon
got stronger. One bottle put me right, and was
worth its weight in gold. I recommend this medi-
cine very strongly. You may use this as you think
fit.
“(Signed) JOHN HOSKING, D.D.”
This Testimony should convince anyone suffering
from INSOMNIA or LOSS OF SLEEP and

curative medicine.

THIN WOMEN!
Would You
Like a Well Developed
and Well Proportioned
FIGURE?
ANY WOMAN without full bust development lacks the one essential
that creates a perfect appearance. Lack of proper bust development, hollow
cheeks and “salt-cellars” quickly take from a woman the bloom and fresh-
ness of healthy womanhood. Misfortune may have been your lot in so far
as natural development is concerned, but science has found a way to correct
your deficiency. Even though you have never been full-bosomed, and have
been attenuated all your life, if you suffer from no wasting disease, your
bosom can be fully developed and your weight increased to normal....
There are to-day hundreds of women who were once thin, flat-bosomed,
hollow-clieeked and generally scraggly in appearance, and suffering the effects of
anaemia and defective digestion, who are now for the first time in their lives
healthy, full-bosomed and pink-cheeked, and enjoying the full vigor of robust
womanhood, as the result of a few weeks under our wonderful
DR. FALEIERE’S FRESH-FOOD.
Flesh-Food is totally harmless in every respect. Its efficacy is beyond question, and its use is
no demand upon the subject’s time. Many cases have gained up to six pounds a week, and an
increase in bust measurement up to eight or ten inches is possible. Flesh-Food offers relief
and development to the thousands of chronically thin women who have despaired of ever possessing
a presentable figure. It is a nerve and tissue food-treatment that adds weight and permanent
development to attenuated women. Guarantee given in every case accepted.
WE HAVE HUNDREDS OE LETTERS LIKE THIS:
Manager “Flesh-Food” Co.. Cympie Queensland, May 6, 1913.
Dear Sir,-—As a nurse, I was very interested In your Flesh-Food treatment, and was greatly
surprised at the wonderful results in my case. When I first wrote to you I was only skin and
bone and I have good cause to be thankful that I wrote you for a free sample, for I feel certain
now that I am one of the very best advertisements you could possibly have, as I am developed In
every way satisfactory to myself, and I have waited a good while to prove If it was lasting In
its effect, and I am now glad to say that your splendid treatment has done absolutely all you
claimed it would, my weight and measurements being ample.—l am, yours gratefully,
Mrs. E. Wingrove.

The Obvious.
Oscar Asche maintains that Australian audiences
prefer the obvious to the fantastic.
If you should crack a subtle joke,
And think thereby to gain a laugh,
You’ll find each unresponsive bloke
Will not appreciate your chaff.
The gag that you so much admired
Is too obscure, it makes him tired.
But break a saucer, or a plate,
Or mention sausages, or beer,
And yells of joy will agitate
The peanut-tainted atmosphere.
Produce a pair of woman’s stays—
Your wit will set the house ablaze.
Sheer bellowdrama, stark and crude,
With grief and gurgling gore replete,
May not attain Art’s altitude,
But it provides dramatic meat.
Though Shakspeare cloys, the appetite
Is keen for “London’s Mud by Night.”
Each lydy, party, bloke or girl
Desires the bald and brutal sin.
A murder sets them in a whirl,
For comedy—sit on a pin.
Melpomene must rouge her nose
And show two lengths of red-striped hose.
Oh ! Life is short, though Art be long !
Prepare the unpoetic meal!
Stewed tripe and onions, hot and strong,
Makes such a sensual appeal!
Produce the “Bad Girl’s Bedroom Sin.”
The maudlin pathos of “East Lynne” !

A Plea for Impenitence.
Never repent.
How vain is the sorrow
That comes with the morrow !
Little comfort you get
From a bitter regret.
What is done must remain,
But if it caused trouble,
Don’t do it again.
Your Future is grey if the Past you lament.
Never repent.
Never repent.
No thought should revolve
Bound a broken resolve.
Let the sins you commit
Be as nightshades that flit
From the gladness of day ;
Not facts to remember
With sadness alway,
Though often you fail in a wiser intent,
Never repent.
Never repent,
Nor suffer black terrors
To wait on your errors.
The true worldly student
Will learn to be prudent.
Thus saith Father Time:
“Where caution spells virtue,
Imprudence is crime.”
But, though you’ve been rash to a certain
extent,
Never repent.
Never repent.
The sins sweet and pieasant,
(Past, future, or present),
The vice and the fault
That are pepper and salt
To the insipid food
Of commonplace mortals
Who try to be good.
Though you flavor one meal with too much
condiment,
Never repent.

Disruption.
I camped one night in a cloistral place
With green gold moss and grasses spread,
And fern-fronds fountaining in grace
And fire-flies palpitant overhead.
The peaks stood mute with brows star-
bound,
The glimmering trees in darkness slept;
Yet, hour by hour, I heard the sound
Of stones that stirred and rolled and leapt.
The whole world dreamed, and sweet and
clear
A crooning creek beside me sang;
Yet now —anon, and far and near,
The restless stones in motion rang.
Nor shape nor shade, I said, abide,
But Change is here, and all is change;
Disruption walks the mountain side
And rends the ribs of peak and range.
Not here alone, beneath night’s mask,
His dread destroying work is done;
Time sets no limit to his task,
Nor space-thronged through with star and
sun.
Behold the seas that brimming fill
The vast green basins of the world —
Shores battered, shattered at their will,
Towns drowned, and towering crags down-
liurled.
From riven cliffs and powdered rocks
And "'ink Sierras of far days,
A grim impermanency mocks
The towers and temples that we raise.
Where altar-fires and lights divine
Once flamed, flame now red flowers and
fruits;
The old stone god beholds his shrine
Destroyed by greedy jungle roots.
Disruption, throned high lord of all,
Perceives the generations pass,
"While, stone by stone, their temples fall
And moulder ’neath the covering grass.
* * * *
Star after star in radiance rolls
Above the tree-clad pinnacles—
Their hours are aeons ; yet time tolls
For them. ... them t 00.... his muffled
bells.

THE CURSE OF VICTORIA.
The Victorian Immigration Department is
a low-spirited institution these days. It
admits that, in some respects, it is a failure
because it can’t induce desirable white
people to come out on a reasonably large
scale. The worst disappointment is in the
matter of nominated immigrants, and to
have to confess even partial ill-success in
that branch of the industry is specially de-
pressing. Nominated immigration is a busi-
ness Which stands strictly on its merits. It
isn’t Worked by lecturers, advertisers, hired
liars, stipendiary scoundrels or other agents.
It has to be honest, or burst. In the first
place - an immigrant comes to the country
and settles.' If, after some experience of
his new surroundings, he is darned glad
that he came, he is liable to urge his friends
and relatives to come also. That is to say,
he nominates them, and if they can pass
inspection they are brought out on very
cheap terms, to find their joyous forerunner
waiting for them with extended arms on
the wharf. On the other hand, if the man
here has ceased to be glad that he came, he
ceases to nominate, and the business lan-
guishes. No doubt there may be exceptional
cases in which the prosperous and satisfied
person here refuses to send for his friends
because he wants Paradise all to himself-
and there may be cases in which an embit-
tered failure deliberately nominates his
enemies and his creditors and his wife’s rela-
tions in the hope that they will come out
and be even more miserable than he is. But
in a general way the success or failure of
the system is a test of the satisfaction or
dissatisfaction of the people who have re-
cently made their homes in the country. The
average settler is usually prepared to be
as well pleased as anybody else when he
gets a chance, so it seems that Victoria
isn’t giving him a chance.
How' much, according to the evidence,
does the Victorian think of his own country
or of the rotten way in which his country is
managed? Just.as little, apparently, as the
New South Waler thinks of his State, or
perhaps even less. His plain and
simple verdict is that the greatest part of
his fertile land is unfit to live in and is
merely a good place to get out of. He
doesn’t give this judgment in words, but in
deeds —which are much more convincing.
And lie has been giving the judgment for a
very long time. Away back in 1861, Vic-
toria wasn’t divided into counties on the
present plan, so comparison can’t be brought
down to a very fine point. Still it is pos-
sible to get at the totals of all the districts,
large and small, and in those far-back days
the prospects of Victorian settlement looked
bright. The railway system, which is now
so carefully devised to drag all foreign trade
to Melbourne, and to handicap all other pos-
sible ports out of existence by means of
impossibly crooked and devious lines or no
lines at all, and by impossibly high rates,
was in its infancy, and people hadn’t even
begun to realise what a curse railways might
be. So long as there was any kind of a bush
road to drag goods along, and a bullock-team
to drag them, and a dray to carry them, one
outlet was about as good as another, and
any place that had a port within hail had
its chance. Also the great land monopolist
THE CURSE OF CONGESTION IN VICTORIA.
Between 1901 and 1911 the fragment of Victoria painted white (Melbourne and its
environs) increased its population by 115,959. In the large section painted black the
population diminished by 1749.
hadn’t yet arrived in all his glory. Except
for one district which suffered from a sud-
denly-perished gold-boom, every section of
the State, so far as can be ascertained,
showed a handsome increase of population
between 1861 and 1871. Even the Mallee
was looking up a little. If there had been
nominated immigration in those days there
was hardly a man in Victoria who wouldn’t
have written to his relatives in Britain, and
urged them to pack up the dog and the baby
and the canary and the cruet, and come at
once to the Land of Promise.
Ten years later the big land monopolist,
whom the Argus is fond of calling a “cap-
tain of rural industry,” had got a stronger
hold, and the policy of dragging all business
to Melbourne, and disqualifying every place
which wasn’t handy to Melbourne, had at-
tained to larger dimensions. And in 1881
the settler began to feel a great deal less
enthusiastic about nominating his brothers
and his sisters and his Aunt Jane and his
Uncle Nathaniel as prospective fellow-
settlers. Out of the 37 counties no less
than nine were already on the down grade.
These were Grant, Dalhousie, Talbot. Gren-
ville, Ripon, Villiers. Karkarooc, Bogong
and Wonnangatta. Karkarooc represented
an ill-watered stretch of Mallee, but all the
other places were fertile and promising, and
nothing save the curse of misgovernment
could account for their downfall. But little
or nothing was done to check the disaster,
and the census of 1891 showed eight
counties —Talbot, Grenville, Ripon, Nor-
manby, Kara Kara. Gladstone, Bendigo and
Wonnangatta—on the road to the moth and
the rust. All of these reoresented country
that Nature had made rich, and which man
—principally the Lands Department and
the Upper House and the big earth-grabber
—had done their best to make hopeless. By
the year 1901 things had become so much
worse that out of 37 counties no less than
13 were in a process of depopulation—
Grant, Dalhousie. Talbot. Grenville, Einon,
Follett, Lowan, Kara Kara, Millewa, Glad-
stone, Gunbower, Rodney and Wonnan-
gatta. Just about here the tendency to write
“home” and nominate the whole family as
desirable immigrants must have sunk very
low indeed, for with one-third of the State
in course of gradual abandonment the out-
look was indeed melancholy. But in 1911
the position was still worse, for the number
of perishing counties had increased to 16—
Anglesey, Benambra, Bendigo, Bogong, Dal-
housie. Dargo, Follett. Gladstone. Grenville,
Kara Kara. Lowan, Millewa, Moira, Talbot,
Tanjie and Wonnangatta. Seven of these
had fewer inhabitants in 1911 than in 1871
—4O consecutive years of progress towards
the dogs. What inducement has any settler
to urge his uncle and his grandfather and
his deceased wife’s sister and his Aunt
Saraii to come, with the family arm-chair
and the hereditary coal-scuttle, to a country
which shows such results as these?
The progress of agricultural settlement and
of settlement in the smaller towns of Vic-
toria may be summed up as follows: —
Population op Victoria.
County of Bourke
(in which Mel-
bourne stands). Rest of State. Total
Increase. Increase. Increase.

1901-11 . . 99,878 14,382 114,210
This doesn’t Look especially well, inasmuch
as the growth of population in the 36 non-
metropolitan counties is less than it ever was
before, and is only about one-ninth of what
it was 40 years ago, while the proportion
of the new population which is absorbed by
the bloated metropolitan county is greater
than it ever was before. But there is
another way of putting the figures which
make them look even worse. During the
period between 4901 and 1911 the county of
Bourke, in which Melbourne is .situated,
and the two adjacent counties of Morning-
ton and Buln Buln. where the rich Mel-
bournian lias his holiday resort and goes
to spend his Saturday to Monday, showed
115,959 increase of population. These three
counties represent 7085 square miles. The
other 34 counties, representing 80,799 square
miles, showed an aggregate decrease of
population amounting to 1749. And the
34 perishing districts stand for practically
all the agricultural, pastoral and mining
industry of Victoria.
Assuming, which seems reasonable enough,
that it is the prosperous immigrant who
urges his friends in the Bull country to
come and join him, and nominates them for
that purpose; also that the prosperous im-
migrant is mostly to be found in prosperous
localities; likewise that a locality which is
being thrown up as a bad job even by its
old inhabitants isn't prosperous—assuming
these things, it seems that there are 34 out
of the 37 Victorian counties in which the
general tendency' must be not to nominate
immigrants. And there are 16 in which
there must be a very definite tendency on
the immigrant’s part to write to mother and
sister in England and hid them avoid the
place as if it were a serpent. Incidentally
it may be mentioned that a number of the
counties which lost population between 1901
and 1911 were wonderfully and amazingly
empty in 1901. Anglesey had one person
to the square mile before its latest loss
began; Benambra, Follet and Lowan had
half a person; Wonnangatta a quarter of a
person; and so on. People were certainly
not crowded out of these fertile and spacious
localities. One reason assigned for the
great failure is the insane railway policy
and one-big-city congestion policy which
aims steadily at concentrating everything at
Melbourne. Another is the evil of big
estates. Another is the amazing old device
which has given existing landowners a sort
of lien on the unsold State lands, and thus
blocked new settlement. These explanations
may be right or they may be wrong, but in
any case it is up to the Watt Government
to find out what is the matter and to repair
the thing, whatever it may be. Victoria is
the smallest of the mainland States, there-
fore there is far less of it than of any other
State which is too far from a seaport for
business purposes. The parts that are most
remote from the sea have the use of the
second biggest river in Australia as a means
of cheap transit. Victoria owns two of
the best ports in Australia —both almost
entirely unused by reason of the jealousy of
Melbourne. It is the only mainland State
no part of which has less than lOin. of
average annual rainfall. It produces about
the best wheat crop on the mainland —where
the big landlord allows wheat to be grown.
In the circumstances there is only one busi-
ness which it is worth while for a Victorian
Government to tackle —that is to find out
what kind of blight or curse or devilment is
making so much of the State such a mighty
good place to get away from, and to
provide a remedy for this getting-away
disease. Nothing else matters. When
fertile areas with one-qUarter or one-half
of a person to the square mile are losing
population there must be a curse of some
sort on the land. And what is a Ministry
for save to locate curses and shift them?
AS IN THE DAYS OF HEROD.
Dear Bulletin, —A recent article by
“John D.” (B. 22/1/Y4) speaks at length
of the reasons why Tasmania is so prone
to lag at the rear of the industrial proces-
sion. It seems strange that this should be
the case of a reasonably-fertile island, with
coal, iron, gold, copper and other minerals, a
fine rainfall, and an immensity of cheap
water power for cheap manufacturing—a
place, too, which had a long start of all its
neighbors bar New South Wales. I should
drop pretty well all the reasons and expla-
nations which “John D.” offers, and lump
the whole trouble into one word —ignorance.
That, it seems to me, is the first cause,
while most of the things “John D.” pro-
pounds are only effects or secondary causes.
* * * *
Tasmania has long had a record as the
most unlettered State in the Commonwealth,
and it is industrially and politically back-
ward as a consequence. So far as the ques-
tion of poverty is ■ ucerned, the industrial
backwardness is t.. most important matter.
The cost of living is really lower in Tas-
mania than in other States. The city
rents are lower also. The steamships that
bring beef and sundries to Hobart or Laun-
ceston may be ravenous enough, but they
aren’t more ravenous than the ones that
bring pigs and pumpkins to Sydney. The
State railways are as good as many of
those in Queensland and Westralia, and
their charges are not high. Also they are
laid out more sensibly than those of N.S.W.
or Victoria. And if the Tasmanian worker
is indigent the Tasmanian capitalist doesn’t
amount to much. A N.S.W. capitalist
would regard him as a poor relation. lie
doesn’t seem to have enough loose or port-
able capital to develop anything worth
speaking of. He has sold most of his in-
surance companies to Australians, and his
solitary steamship co. to Maorilanders, and he
appears incompetent to start anything new.
The old-established ignorance is at the back of
all these troubles. When an up-to-date coun-
try takes to running an industry, no matter
what it may be, with up-to-date machinery
it is dead certain that any rival country
which runs that same industry with anti-
quated truck and old scrap-iron devices
must pay poor wages and yield poor returns.
A hundred trades unions won’t alter the
situation. And it is the nigger coun-
try or the poorly-educated white country
which plods along with antiquated truck
and old methods worked by hand because
the employers don’t know enough to get bet-
ter machinery and the employees haven’t
a chance to learn how to work it. So when
the employee rises to be an employer he isn’t
much more intelligent than his old boss. The
world has been struck at various times with
inventions which enabled one man to do the
work which formerly involved the labor of
10 or 20 or even 2000. That made so much
more wealth that the organised worker could
demand a share of it. When he threatened
to stop the implement that was grinding out
sovereigns for the employer, that stout,
astounded person had to sit up and listen to
reason ; while if he merely threatened to stop
the implement that was grinding out pennies
the employer didn’t mind so very much. The
stoppage of the old thing didn’t matter to any
great extent. Anyhow the worker couldn’t
get more than his work produced, and against
that dead wall he came up with a bump. The
man who toils with out-of-date apparatus, in
competition with the one who has much
better means at his command, can’t earn
very much of a wage even if he gets all the
value of his output.
The portable wealth of Tasmania is so
small (though the nominal wealth in land
values is big enough) that industrial organi-
sation never got a fair start. Where there is
very little to divide there is little reason or
inducement to put up a fight over the ques-
tion of a fair division. It is easier to go to
some State where conditions are better, and
for many years the best of the young men of
Tasmania have gone, and have left the old
ignorant Tories to run the show. If these
emigrants had come back with their new
ideas they might have shaken the isle to its
foundations, but they didn’t come back. Now-
adays Labor holds half the seats in the As-
sembly, but that is largely owing to the fact
that the mining vote on the West Coast gave
it a new political start, and the mining indus-
try on the West Coast is not run by the
sluggish Tasmanian capitalist who often has
very little but his pomp and his top-hat and
a lot of neglected land as capital. The island
is, for its size, better furnished with the raw
material of industry than any other State —
and it knows less than most other States
about putting its assets to good use. Raw
material, unless combined with up-to-date
methods, doesn’t produce wealth. Even
Adam, who owned the earth and had no boss
to “pole” on his earnings, no landlord to pay
and no money-lender to satisfy, hadn’t the
price of a suit of slop clothes about
him. And Noaii, who also owned the
earth, had only one drunk in his life. If
Tasmania can shift a lot of its ignorance
other good things will follow. Incidentally
it is worth noting that the Premier who re-
presents the party of Ancient Backwardness
is named Solomon. The old Solomon wrecked
a kingdom, and the new one seems very little
ahead of him. —Yours etc., Herman Hogg.
PLAIN ENGLISH.
Our Good Ten-Shilling Note.
Sometimes it almost appears as if the Com-
monwealth Bank didn’t take itself and its
paper money seriously. On two occasions
a Bulletin man has happened in on the
institution between one and two, in search
of a supply of ten-shilling notes, and has
been told that he couldn’t get more than a
very few until two o’clock struck, because
some person of great tonnage and import-
ance was out at lunch, and had left the
handy, low-priced paper locked up. The
Bulletin man left uncursed the things he
ought to have cursed, and departed quietly,
but he will never do so again. He has
learned the ritual appropriate to the
occasion. One day last week he called
shortly after two, and found the place per-
vaded by a good, short, thick patriot
in a blue suit. This person, so _it
transpired at the top of his voice,
had been refused ten-shilling notes at
1.30, because the lunch-person who
wouldn’t be back till two had again left the
main supply locked up. Now he had re-
turned in an angry mood, and, having got
his cash, he was asking questions. _lt was
difficult to follow him, for he spoke in some
baste, but it seemed that he wanted to know
if this place was a bank anyhow, or was it
a blithered old cavern inhabited by canni-
bals? Did it know its business, and wasn t
it better qualified to sell peanuts? Did it


know when to come in out of the wet, or had
it lost its dashed blue-mouldy um-
brella? Could it leave the door in
broad daylight and walk round a tree
once without losing itself? Did it
want a dog to lead it round? Was its
grandmother a monkey, and did its mother
know what had become of it since it quitted
home in the morning? The fierce man in
the blue suit was soothed with an assurance
that it was the custom to leave only a few
ten-shilling notes out, but he didn’t soothe
worth a halfpenny. He opined that that
sort of custom ought to be boiled, and asked
if it was also the habit to leave out only
one sovereign, one shilling, a sixpence, a
“thrum” and two pennies? He opined that
the person in charge of the ten-shilling notes
ought to lunch on thistles within the
premises if he couldn’t trust anybody else
with the paper in his absence? He even
seemed to hint that the bank was in league
with bloated private capitalists to prevent
its own good Federal paper getting into cir-
culation. He suspected the manager of being
a disguised emissary of Rome, likewise an
Orangeman. He wanted to see the manager,
anyhow, and diagnose him. He thought the
whole staff didn’t know enough to tell where
Moses was when the light went out.
He was frankly of opinion that the
blessed place didn’t do any business.
He didn’t think the windows were
cleaned or the floor washed. One of the chief
officials, in his opinion, had a bigamous or
Unitarian expression. If the whole" staff
wanted to put him out he was willing that
it should make the attempt. He could fight
any bank that hadn’t an adequate supply of
its own notes. He declared that he. at all
events, knew how many beans made one,
even if the establishment didn’t. Then he
took a long breath and began to get
started, but unfortunately The Bulletin
man had to go about his business, and so
missed what might have been a really inter-
esting discussion. At the same time it is a
fair thing to suggest that the Commonwealth
Bank might shove its good paper on the
public a little more earnestly. The joint-
stock banks are enabled to boycott the ten-
shilling note because the Australian Govern-
ment hasn’t had the sense to abolish the
foolish old half-sovereign. And when the
Government institution treats its own note
as a sort of outcast during the lunch hour
it doesn’t give the document much of a
chance.

About Two States that only Fought
with Their Mouths.
A lovely old dispute—the kind of thing
that in the Bad Old Times would certainly
have meant a war of conquest, and pro-
bably subsequent wars of re-conquest—has
been given the final knock-out by the Privy
Council in London. When South Aus. and
Victoria were being carved out of this con-
tinent, Britain fixed the bojfndary between
them at longitude 141. There were no
natural features of any kind to show where
one was to leave off and Ihe other begin; it
was just a straight line drawn on a map.
And nobody knew where longitude 141 was.
It was calculated by one Tyeks, in 1839, as
being in such-a-place, and in 1847, when
the thing was definitely tackled, Wade and
White, for the opposite sides, seem both to
have accepted the calculations of Tyeks.
Anyway, they, agreed, and the western
boundary of Victoria was drawn as it now
appears. About 1869, with improved sur-
veying methods, long. 141 was found to be
a good two miles east of where it had been
shown, and ever since then South Aus. has
been trying to get the boundary rectified.
Victoria simply held on, and said the thing
had been settled long ago, once for all.
That highly practical lawyer, C. C.
Kingston, offered, when Premier of S.A.
20 years ago, to leave the decision to a few
judges from the other States—a kind of
informal High £ourt. But nothing was
doing in that way. A little later, Pkice for
S.A. and Bent for Victoria got even nearer
a settlement. They agreed, so far as they
were concerned, that Victoria, needing ter-
ritory most, should keep the strip and pay
£200,000 or so as compensation. The Vic.
Parliament would, however, not hear of
this. The strip was Victoria’s, it said,
without any payment at all. Meanwhile it
has steadily waxed in value. Two miles
doesn’t sound much, but reckoning its length,
it means about 600 square miles, worth
anything up to half a million. At last
(1911) S.A. went to the High Court about
it, and was pronounced to be in the wrong
in law, though in fact long. 141 was ad-
mitted to be where modern surveyors put it,
and not where the old ones did. This ad-
mission, and the dissenting of Justice Hig-
gins from the rest; of the Court, encouraged
S.A. to go on to fhe Privy Council, which
has now said just what the High Court
said, and what Victoria has always said:
Tyers was fairly lucky to get within two
miles of correctness. South Aus. in 1847
adopted and “proclaimed” his old line, and
that was the end of it. Otherwise the
States’ boundary would be liable to shift
from year to year, and century to century,
as surveying methods improved. Both sides
were right, in a sense, but one had to suffer.
They can be congratulated on tackling the
sore poiqi with good temper. They could be
congratulated much jnore if they had adopted
Kingston’s simple—and cheap—suggestion
of 1894. As things are, South Australia’s
Bill of Costs will be horrible.
The Dominions Commission Sees Things.
The DQminions Royal Commission, which
Britain recently sent wandering over the
Empire, didn’t include any men of over-
whelming brain, but judging from its report
some of its members knew or suspected
something. Its report has been arriving
here by scrappy cables, and the very first
item of it, as published in Sydney Tele-
graph, read thus:—
The report of the Dominions Royal Commission
which visited all parts of the Empire last year, has
been issued.
greatest problems, it is pointed out,
are in regard to THE BETTER DISTRIBUTION OF
PULATION. and improved oversea communication.
’1 he better distribution of population ! Why,
certainly! In a country where Adelaide
holds 4601, and Melbourne 4404, and Syd-
ney 3897 out of every 10,000 people in their
respective States there is very probably
something wrong with the distribution of the
people. Of these places the first two are
perhaps not quite so bad as they look, for the
district which is called Adelaide in the cen-
sus return is almost big enough to be a
county, and official Melbourne wanders over
half a county. But they are bad enough,
and Sydney is quite as lamentable. When
the biggest part of N.S.W. and the biggest
section of Victoria are losing population
while the sensational capitals bloat larger
and larger, affairs can’t be quite healthy.
It is the habit of politicians to blankly ig-
nore the subject, for there are heaps of votes
to be got in the huge centres, while there
are none as yet in the unbuilt cities which
ought to exist but don’t, alongside the great
harbors which ought to be busy but aren’t.
With his eye fixed solely on next election,
the politician doesn’t think it worth while
to tackle enterprises which, however good
they may be for the country, can’t yield a
harvest. of direct support for some years,
and which may aggravate some of the exist-
ing support in the meantime. The Sydney
Telegraph, not content with ignoring the
subject, even rises now and then to de-
nounce the decentralisation policy as a mis-
guided fraud. Its method is simple. It
asks passionately in a leading article if any-
body professes to think Sydney is in the
wrong place. Nobody does, of course, any
more than people in England hold that the
existence of Liverpool, Cardiff, Glasgow,
Leith, Belfast, etc., implies that London is
in the wrong place. Does anybody say that
Sydney hasn’t a good harbor? Nobody
does. Has anybody the effrontery to pro-
fess that the destruction of Sydney would
benefit N.S.W. ? As nobody dreams of de-
stroying Sydney the answer is dead
silence. Does any country town, however
remote, object to being provided with a rail-
way to Sydney? Naturally no one does.
When it is a choice between a line to
Sydney (even though an equally good port
may be 200 or 300 miles nearer) or else no
line at all, the country town grabs with
both hands at what it can get. It would
sooner have a line to Greece or Palestine
than nothing at all. And after these thun-
derous remarks the whole question is under-
stood to be settled, and the greater part of
N.S.W. goes on losing population in the old
fashion. By way of a saving clause, and to
show its liberal-mindedness, the old rag
generally adds that other ports for oversea
traffic may arise in time, but if the Tele-
graph and similar metropolitan influences
can still prevent other ports being made
accessible by roads, railways, wharves and
the like, they won’t arise either in time or
eternity—the long thing that comes after
time. Meanwhile the evil is so huge and
glaring and crude that even a fast-travelling
Dominions Commission can see it. For
that matter the Telegraph also sees it—in
a way. It is always ready to point out how
a few dozen miles of railroad transit might
be saved on N.S.W.’s exports at the English
end by opening up a direct trade with Hull
or Cardiff or some such place instead of
congesting all our business into the one port
of London. But it never can see the advan-
tage of saving much greater distances at
this end. The Telegraph’s office and ad-
vertising business aren’t in London, \vhich
makes a heap of difference.
Bishop Phelan and the Wowser.
A deplorable divine, with a proud uncon-
sciousness of his own deplorableness, is
Bishop Phelan, of the R.C. Church in Vic-
toria- The other Sunday, down at Sale,
which is his diocese, he gave slops to di-
vorced citizens, whilst getting in a dig at his
Church’s special aversion, the Wowser.
Bishop Phelan’s grievance against Wowsers
on this occasion was that they “hold up their
hands in holy horror at harmless amuse-
ments, but allow, without one word of pro-
test, the destroying angel of divorce to drag
Christian society to a pagan state.” The
destroying angel aforementioned is “far
more injurious to national life in White Aus-
tralia than the colored peoples of China or
Japan would be,” said Bishop Phelan.
With a few indirect references to Henky the
Eighth, the good Bishop concluded his ser-
mon on Marriage. Now, from an ungodly
I rotestant point, of view, the celibate priest
who preaches this dogma is personally more
excusable than the much-married C. of E.
Archbishop who raves to the same effect. The
priest doesn’t really know what he is talking
about. The Anglican parson does. But
what the priest says is law to a great many
people, whereas the dictum of an Anglican
parson matters not tuppence to anybody who
has sound natural reasons for disagreeing
with it. Therefore Bishop Phelan is de-
plorable. The other Church dignitary doesn’t
matter. If Archbishop Clarice were to
cry: “Better a Piebald Australia without a
divorce license than a White Australia with
it,” his own flock would laugh, and the
opposition would be listening elsewhere. If
he declared that United States society, whose
married women are the spoilt children of
Christendom, was being dragged to paganism
by the black angel of divorce, nobody would
take his . Nibs seriously, whereas Bishop
1 helan impresses a large percentage of the
faithful with the idea that a hateful mar-
riage union is a sacred thing. The Phe-
lanic case for the holiness of matrimony
admits of shocking illustrations. For in-
stance, he maintains that a man must remain
for ever married to a wife who left him to
go and live with a tinted alien, or took to
the streets for a living. And a woman is
tied for all time to a brutal husband whom
her soul abhors. Under penalty of spiritual
death she is forbidden to turn to the sym-
pathetic lodger for consolation. National
life would be injured if she were to get a
divorce and marry the lodger rather than
remain doomed to produce more children to
her lawful brute under Heaven’s blessing,
lhis is what Phelan, the Bishop, says, and,
because Mr. Wowser is silent on the subject,
he snorts at him. He doesn’t consider how
circumstances alter cases. Wowser, Lord
forgive him, is a married man who can feel
for another, and has heard a good deal
about divorce from the old woman’s point of
view.
«
One Shirt.
It is the small incidents which count. The
South African Government seized 12 strike
leaders and sent them surreptitiously by
night on board a steamer bound for Eng-
land. It might be a high-handed and illegal
way of doing things, but there are far worse
deeds on record, and the act at least showed
courage. The Government gave the cap-
tain of the ship £3 for each man, the money
to be paid over on arrival in London. That
proceeding wasn’t big and strenuous and
piratical; it didn’t show courage j it was
simply mean and pawn-brokerish. And
the same Government provided each prisoner
with one shirt, one singlet and one pair of
socks for the voyage. Tha,t was worse than
mean; it was uncivilised and insanitary.
A Government that knew how to be a gen-
tlemanly brigand or large-souled Tory would
have shoved every strike leader on board
ship, with a warning not to come back; and
given each man £5O, and told him tbat his
wife and family would be well looked
after till permanent arrangements could
be made, and would have supplied
him with two suits, two pairs of boots,
12 shirts, 12 pairs of socks, six singlets, a
pack of cards, some books, and an order for
a reasonable amount of tobacco and re-
freshment. Then it would have shaken
hands with the deported ones all round,
and said it was very glad to have made
their acquaintance, and promised to shoot
them without trial if it ever met them again;
and ordered champagne for a parting drink ;
and passed along the cigars ; and told them
to go to Sheol. Finally it would have had
a brass band to give them a send-off. That
kind of high-handed Toryism can make it-
self liked after a fashion, but the kind that
serves out £3, also one shirt, one pair of
socks and one singlet can’t be other than
unpopular.
The Homeless Women of Sydney.
During the year 1913 Sydney, according to
Statistician Tbivett, added 30,600 to its
population. It is the biggest one-year in-
crease on record, and as it is very much
more than the average increase for the
whole State it is presumable that the rest
of N.S.W. isn’t moving much, if at all. As
no builder could foresee this sudden jump—
the result of spending £8,500,000 of loan
money in one year—or could have kept pace
with it in any case, the house famine is
naturally a matter of earnest discussion.
One recent morning two women turned up
at Redfern Court to ask for advice. Thev
were under notice to quit, and though they
were apparently solvent and reputable
females they could find no places to go to.
That was one morning’s crop of distracted
females at one court only The “beak”
could only say regretfully that he had no
houses concealed about him. Also he had
no power to compel the landlord to keep liis
present tenants, and if he could make the
house-owner retain Mrs. Smith as a tenant
that would only render Mrs. Jones home-
less instead—Mrs. Jones who relies on
getting the tenement now occupied by
Mrs. Smith to save her and her family
from sleeping in the Domain and perform-
ing their toilet at the public fountain.
Mrs. Smith is in real distress, vet she is
illogical. Either the people of Sydney must
crowd four times as closely together as they
do now in order to be as handy to their
work as in a British city of the same popu-
lation, and that means slums, misery, utter
lack of decency and shameful overcrowding
or many of them must live four times as
far from their employment as the British
worker thinks practicable, and unless there
is an enormous advance in the matter of
swift and cheap and abundant means of
communication that is impossible. The
spectacle of Mrs. Smith, a respectable in-
habitant of an almost empty country, asking
a distracted magistrate to assist her by
making Mrs. Jones homeless instead of her-
self, by reason of sheer want of space,
is grievous, but it isn’t easy to see
what can be done. Perhaps the silly old
Millions. Club knows of a remedy. It doesn’t
look as if it knew anything, but it may have
disguised intelligence concealed in its hinder
pocket.
“The Pilot’s” yarn:—
A lumbering old coaster, the Mokau, gave Sydney’s
ferry travellers a sharp reminder last Saturday of
their constant dangers, when she struck the old
cross-harbor trafficker, Me Mel, and sunk her in five
minutes. With the greatest consideration, the* Moo
Cow chose an unbusy hour, and selected the narrow-
est part of Darling Harbor for the illustration. The
result of the impact was to crumple the Me Mel up
like a cardboard box, and while she is not con-
structed on modern lines to withstand such shocks, it
must be remembered that the wooden Moo Cow is
no modern greyhound. What happened to the Me
Mel would probably happen to the best of the ferry
steamers were she to be hit in the same way by a
steel cargo carrier or collier. Anyway, the collision
showed (1) that the bulkheads of vessels of the type
of the Me Mel are not to be depended on when the
vessel is rammed amidships; and (2) that the life-
saving appliances are not to be reckoned on, either.
The Me Mel was struck when near a convenient wharf,
and the Mokau, by an inspiration of the skipper,
crowded as much of herself into the aperture as
possible until the two dozen passengers scrambled
ashore. Such a fortuitous set of circumstances can’t
be counted on when the next collision comes along,
and it is up to the Harbor Trust to ascertain how
many matchboxes of the Me Mel type are still used
on Sydney Harbor. I can name one or two, at least,
with certificates for large numbers of passengers
(according to the Marine Department the Me Mel
was good for several hundreds). I suppose there
will be the usual court shindy over this case, but,
personally, I extend the glad hand to the Moo Cow
for her kindness in giving the quietus to one Harbor
Ark.

The British Dominions Commission, casting
a presumably unbiassed eye on Northern
Australia, remarked that it would be a good
and profitable place to grow cotton, and
that white labor would fill the bill well
enough. It added that 75 per cent, of the
cotton grown in Texas (U.S.A.) is pro-
duced by white labor. And then, having
thus held on high the lamp of common sense
and the illumination of brains, the Com-
mission disgraced itself by suggesting the
importation of Maltese immigrants. It
isn’t the first time such a proposition has
been made, and the reason of it is difficult
to find. The Maltese dog had some points
inasmuch as there was very little of him, but
why worry about the Maltese human? The
population of his little isle is largely of
Asiatic origin and is derived from the
Semites of Phoenicia. There }s also a streak
of the Arab, and more than a streak of
another. variety of nosey old Semite, the
Carthaginian. The local language is still,
so far as can be ascertained, a bashed variety
of the old speech of Tyre and Sidon. The
Maltese is a cheerful person, but he has ho
fighting record, and at best there are only
about 230.000 of him. He wouldn’t be much
in a whole continent. Besides, he is a de-
vout Roman Catholic. He couldn’t be im-
ported here without maddening Brother
Snowball, of the Orang? Lodge, and our
good brother Snowball is wild enough
already. His shouts about the walls of
Derry make sleep almost impossible.

“0.K.”: Lord Denman’s announcement of
the approaching end of his G.-G.-ship is
a humorous reminder of his private-box pose
at the theatre when the orchestra is playing
“God Save.” No previous G.-G. took him-
self quite so seriously as Denman does, I
fancy. When he was about to tell the Melb.
A.N.A. gathering of his solemn determina-
tion, he wore the air of a doctor who fears
to announce the worst. He assured his
hearers that his decision to resign his billet
had not been arrived at without very careful
deliberation. He had given earnest thought
to the question whether he should get leave
of absence for a few months, and then return
to his Work, but he feared that the Com-
monwealth would suffer if he were absent
at a time when the political situation is full
of uncertainty. And so forth. At the close
of the proceedings, when the A.N.A.-ers
were dead tired of hearing one political per-
son after another rise to express grief, re-
gret, “dampened feelings,” and grave con-
cern at the awful news, Denman said he
was sorry to have “introduced a note of sad-
ness into the luncheon.” Why did he
choose a. public occasion for appearing to
inflict grief, regret, dampness and concern
upon sundry artful old stagers to whom his
announcement was no surprise at all? A
paragraph in the newspapers at Christmas
holiday time, when Australia was too busy
to feel broken up, would have met all re-
quirements, official and otherwise. Why
make a bombshell of the news and drop it
melodramatically among the plates and
bottles? And why. Oh why. did Lord D. try
to persuade himself that an actual Gov.-
General is of any more use than an Acting
G.-G. in times of political crisis? The first
duty of every vice-regal person should he to
think of how the country would get along
just the same if he were dead.

Our Ally—the Geisha.
[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
The first white woman to become a geisha is an
Englishwoman, who has been licensed to appear in
a Yokohama tea garden. She was formerly a
teacher in the service of the Governor-General of
Korea, and is an accomplished eamisen player (a
Japanese instrument of three strings, resembling the
banjo).— Cable.
All the weird and rotten noises of “the
East,”
The sounds -that tear the soul in Tokio.
The tone-deaf Jap a-squeaking at the Feast
Of the Cherry Blossom of the U-ge-no,
The Geishas—apple-shaped and short of leg,
Like human dachshunds—for one-half a yen
Make noises on a piece of brandy keg—
That three-stringed horror called the sam-
isen.
From gilded cages in the Place of Reeds,
From the lacquer and the glitter and the
sheen,
Where on prostitution the Jap father feeds —
To the flesh serfs of the Hotel Nectarine;
The bowel-twisting sounds are out to slay,
The noises that destroy the sons of men,
The squeaks that never vary, day by day,
The doubly, trebly cursed samisen.
The English and the Jap are all the same,
Preaching virtue while they cover up the
crime ;
All islanders can play an island game,
And the samisen has neither tune nor time;
The white man’s prestige suffers with the
shriek —
The suffragette is now the suffra-yen,
Betraying of her blood six times a week,
By the twanging of the ghastly samisen.
Its “pink-a-rinka” curdles all your blood.
Its B flat dries the marrow of your bones;
And it makes jtour vital juices turn to mud,
And when it’s;gayest it produces groans.
At the sixteenth bar your toe-nails start to
grow
In a talon-fashion loved by Chiney-men.
It’s a natural accomp’nist for a crow —

So one by one they pull the barriers down,
Which for our children’s sake we’d build up

The barriers twixt white and black and

Our ally, with his poverty and greed.
He knows the sword is stronger than the

And grins whene’er he sees the white man’s

Japanned to match the awful samisen.
For a pretty English lady plays it now
With its whanging, grumfling, whining,

And our ally will be able to show how
He sings better than a white man ever sang.
The white man’s prestige goes to yellow

Last week the Melbourne police did a sin-
fully foolish thing. They , got wind of the
fact that certain local Chows had laid in a
stock of daggers, revolvers and ammunition,
with a view to fighting to a finish for the
possession of an 18-year-old white girl who
was dwelling in the Lilly Buck-stleet dis-
trict. The police went and arrested the
damsel, and seized the deadly weapons before
the battle had taken place, instead of waiting
for two or three deaths ere the tart of con-
tention was removed. She is now in a
Salv’army Home, and the Celestials, instead
of dying in a fray, live to hunt another prey.
Last week’s evidence before the Inter-State
Commission cast a sidelight of satire on Aus-
tralian glorification of its national tree. A
witness declared that half the tanneiies in
Victoria would have been compelled to close
up last year, but for the supplies of wattle
bark that came along from S’Africa, which
obtained its first wattle seeds from this
country. Australia has instituted an annual
feast of wattle blossom in the cities without
taking measures to provide an adeouate
supply of wattle bark for the local tanneries.
It remains for the State Governments to
start farms of wattles for barking purposes.
Like many similar bodies, Melb. City
Council has bad luck with the articles it im-
ports, mostly because the local manufacturer
gets no encouragement to make them. The
other day it imported a motor watering-cart,
and persuaded itself it was going to kill the
dust-fiend in one act. The first difficulty
arose when it was discovered that certain
pipe connections wouldn’t fit the street hy-
drants, somebody or other having overlooked
that small detail. However, the Yarra still
held a few gallons of fluid, so the staff got
the concern going, ran it over Prince’s Bridge
and backed it towards the stream. Either
the backing was too vigorous or the bank
unexpectedly steep, for the jigger started on
a swift career to where the suicides lie till
they are dredged up. The driver promptly
leaped for his life, and the staff stood aghast,
till the new importation was saved from being
a submarine by some of the undergear catch-
ing the bluestone spawls. The more or less
reliable old horse was then harnessed up and
the concern dragged away for repairs.
From the Oldest Inhabitant:—
A fire on the water’s edge at Mosman Bay, Sydney
Harbor, last week destroyed an ancient building with
some history plastered on it. In the ’3Q’s, when
Archie Mossman had his whaling station here—known
then as Great Sirius Cove —he built a few solid stone
houses for the accommodation of his whalers. The
one just burned was among them. It was fitted
with bunks like the forecastle of a ship. Not far
away was another oottage of the Same build, used
also by whalers ; and across the road were two other
cottages and a store-house of two storeys. The store-
house is the only one of all the Mosman buildings
now left. It is enclosed with an immense advertising
hoarding; the interior is a receptacle for filth, and
allegedly a resort for nightbirds. Yet there was a
time when it was of some repute. The upper floor
had in those days been removed, and a gallery
thrown across one end, and there a band was
stationed on dance nights. From this gallery candi-
dates also addressed the free and independent at
election times. There are creepy tales told of this
old building in the days when smuggling and illicit
distillation were paying games. The dense scrub and
numerous gullies round about lent themselves to the
enterprises of the daring blokes of the time, and the
old store is said to have been the resting place of
many a cask of spirits that never had a gauger’s
stick dipped in it. Archie Mossman died in 1863,
aged 64, and is buried at St. Jude’s, Randwielc.
True to his anti-defence principles, Joe
Cook made a point of attending the farewell
sej-mon of parson Leyton Richards, the im-
ported brand-snatcher who spent most of his
time while in Melbourne in trying to dis-
credit the Australian military training
scheme. Richards’s final exhortation to the
flock (including Cook) ran this way:—
Gloss the fact over as you may, armies and
navies exist for organised murder.
And the police who carry batons are organ-
ised agents of assault and battery, and the
surgeons who carry instruments to save life
are organised butchers, and the bolts and
bars on Leyton Richards’s door' are brutal
instruments for keeping honest burglars from
mpking a living, and the clergy to which
Richards belongs is an organised army for
starving the poor Devil. Assuming that
Leyton Richards has a missus, and a beast
broke in at night and demanded the lady,
what would Leyton do about it? Would he
give the missus up, or, if the beast showed
fight, would Richards fight? And if he
would fight, does Richards think it wouldn’t
be better for him—not to mention the lady—
if he organised his fighting beforehand, and
took the risk of some clerical ass calling
him a potential murderer?

“The Grafters” were resurrected at Syd-
ney on Saturday by Willanderson’s U.S.
Burlesque Co., amidst the tumultuous ap-
proval of those who gained admittance to
the Palace, and the maledictions of those who,
having failed, were constrained to patronise
the pubs, the open-air services of Bro. Snif-
lcins, or even the shows where the haughty
duchesses from Clapham Rye shake a leg for
the uplifting of the masses. It wasn’t Bert
Le Blanc, or Harry Burgess, or Dave Nowlin,
or Anna Clarke, or Carlton Chase who re-
marked, “I Cannot Sing the Old Songs Now.”
Successes of the original season —“Oh, Say,
Wouldn’t That be a Dream,” “I am the Con-
stable,” “Heaven Will Protect a Working
Girl,” “Big Chief Smoke,” “San Francisco,”
and others—caught the crowd in the old
place. There is more broad amusement and
more catchy music in “The Grafters” than
in “A Day at the Races,” and, in order to
allow theatregoers to ascertain this for them-
selves, Mr. Anderson has kindly consented to
play the former piece for the next three
weeks at the usual prices. No change can be
made in these arrangements. Requests to
put on “Lady Audley’s Secret,” or “A Loan
in London” haven’t got a dog’s hope.

The White City (Sydney) has laid in an
alleged drunk named Calvert. He professes
to be extremely blitherecl on a high wire, and
when he reels along his precarious way in
search of ground and lofty beer the chances
that he will keep up till next drink look very
small. Incidentally there are some “maniac
bulldogs.” All bulldogs are more or less in-
sane, but these ones are as mad as six
hatters.

At the welcome season of high comedy at

crowded, intent and pleqsed—also in order.
The most bare-faced of theatrical fakes
yet offered to Sydney, 666,” at the
Criterion, shows no sign of being seen
through yet. For this unhapoy result the
infectious comedy of Fred Niblo and the
conscientious work of his company of Aus--
tralians are to be blamed.

are hereby advised to drop in before the

“Come Over Here,” which resides at Her
Majesty’s, Sydney, though roundly con-
demned by the occasional theatregoer who
hasn’t found the revue all that he or she ex-
pected, continues to draw the inquisitive
populace, and the managerial advertisement
throws admiring fits about the well-meaning
show in every issue of the morning paper.
It will be a dark day for the J.G.W. revue
when the house advertisement turns against
it. The tragedy of a feeble old man being
bitten by his own tripehound would be no-
thing compared to that fearful spectacle.

For the benefit of Sydney cinemaniacs: —
Crystal Palace : “Next Generation,” which is
just what the title would lead you to suspect. It
impresses on the world in general that a boy is his
father’s old man —and, in Australian politics, at
any rate, is expected to pay for the old man’s
extravagances.
Lyric : “A Fallen Idol,” concerning the downfall
of a lady who acted as model for a beautiful statue.
Moral: You can’t tell a model by the statue.
Empress: “The Carrier Pigeon” deals with the
attempts of a business man to convert to his own
use the firm’s cash under the impression that his
partner is dead. Discovered by the moving picture
operator, and another plot fails. A series of talk-
ing pictures in addition.
Colonial : “Padrone’s Plot,” illustrating how,
when the Mexican ranch boss is out to make money,
he goes even further than the Stock Exchange satel-
lite ; also showing how he subsequently makes use of
State Rights to dodge the law.
Spencer’s Lyceum: “A Message from Mars,” a
great picture of an even greater subject, to be re-
leased on Saturday. Till then, “By the Cross,” a
half-brother to “Quo Vadis.”
West’s Glaciarium: “The Stolen Child,” adapted
from the French “Sans Famille,” an excellent film,
also showing at the Olympia.
Imperial: “In Convict Garb,” as well as a good
miscellaneous programme.

An even-time comedy daughter of Uncle
Sam, named Elfie Fay, is shaking up the
proceedings at the National Amphitheatre
(Sydney) this week. Her voice is on the
weak side, but her “business” beats anything
else . in. town. Nothing so different has
drifted in since sister Millie Dorris conducted
service at the ragtime tabernacle. Other
notable new-comers are the Miller Sisters,
one who. makes music and one who : —
never mind; at all events she dances a
native wliat’s-its-name from Hawaii, and
that more than covers any shortages.

Selma Braatz is the latest name on the
long list of jugglers, female and otherwise,
at Sydney Tivoli; and there is nothing to
say about her that has not been said at
some time or other about the rest of them,
except, that she employs a heavy-weight
assistant (also female) who juggles with
soap bubbles. So Tiie Bulletin merely
remarks that she is as good as all but the
very best. The Five Petleys are having a
second innings, and the Schmettans, Rose
and Ellis, the barrel-jumpers, De Fra the
chair balancer, and Josephine Davis are all
getting ready to move on. Next week the
Tiv. should have an almost new programme.
If it has a second one that it has no use for,
it might present it to the N.S.W. Liberal
party. Wade needs a new programme even
more than Mclntosh.
. * * * *
The King’s (Adelaide) is switching on
new Brennan-Fuller turns so quickly that
it has got the public feeling that a fort-
nightly visit is necessary unless something
good is to be missed. Troutt, the American
waterman, has raised his fancy tricks in a
tank to the level of a fine art; and the
pretty girl who married him in Maoriland is
rapidly acquiring them too, and is being
harmlessly drowned with regularity. The
Vardells do their ground and ring athletics
blindfolded, and Bailey’s posing dogs have
just introduced their canine statuary. The
bears which should have been in this show
got melted in Brisbane, and had to. be
rushed down to M.L. The Tivoli people
are in their new open-air enclosure at the
Oval, where the Graus brothers do some
new things in balancing on lofty perches.
Roma fiddles, and Deean and Aveol juggle,
but nobody is more popular- ttyan the chatty
Du Calion, who modestly admits that he is
called after a Greek god of somewhat similar
name. Branscombe’s “Dandies” go on as
before at the Exhibition Garden, and man-
ager Howells has nothing to do but bank
the proceeds. Pudney’s “Moths” are doing
the same kind of thing on the shore at
Glenelg, and at the Semaphore beach a lot
of young people, mostly Adelaideans, carry
on the joyful work. Wondergraph (outdoors
and in) still relies mainly on the seasonable
lady-bathers’ competition (second heat
keenly contested) ; and West’s, with “Be-
tween Man and Beast,” establishes once
more that films introducing animals are the
surest draw of all, provided the animals are
wild enough. Absolutely peaceful creatures
don’t count.
*
The revival of “Milestones” at Melb.
Royal shows a few points of difference from
last year’s performance, and some of them
are improvements. The countenances of
John, Gertrude and Rose —especially John—
are old for their ages in the first act, also
the trio are decrepit beyond their years in
the third act, but in other respects the char-
acters are ‘perhaps more effectively presented
than of yore. Greenaway’s, picture of the
broken-down Sam Sibley is excellent. Miss
Eily Mdlyon is just the sweetest mother
who ever took the dutiful subjection of her
daughter for granted. Miss Noble’s imper-
sonation of the high-spirited spinster, soured
in SRite of herself, carries conviction with it.
Miss Temple, who continues to present an
absurd caricature of Nancy in the second
act, has ihade her a more genial old matron
in 1912 than she used to be. Miss Maggie
Knight’s small contribution to the piece has
lost none of its value, and Miss Irene
Browne is evidently taking a turn for the
better. She is speeding-up her diction. Her
Emily Rhead is a more winsome girl and a
less depressing widow than she was last
year. If she will make Ihe widow a little
brighter there will seem to be reasonable
cause for Arthur Preece wanting to marry
her. The new members of the cast are T.
Lloyd as Preese, Miss Dorothy Cumming as
the Hon. Muriel, and Raymond Lawrence
as young Richard. Lloyd is satisfactory,
but not so engaging in his style as his pre-
decessor ; Miss Cumming is an attractive
Muriel, with less unnecessary. hardness of
manner than her forerunner, but she is still
amateurish-, and Lawrence is brusquely re-
pellent where Ronald Macleod was pleasingly
off-handed. Muriel’s affection for the pre-
sent Richard is unaccountable.'
Next Saturday there will be a revival of
“The Lion and the Mouse” at the Royal.
Five nights of the American drama
will close the season of Julius Knight and
Co., and on the 14th comes “Joseph and His
Brethren,” which has been disparagingly
described as “Another Sign of the Cross.”
Which it isn’t, unless it shamelessly perverts
the Biblical story. Joseph doesn’t sing in
back streets like the Early Christians, or
stick out his chest and legs in the Marcus
Tremendous fashion. Pharaoh doesn’t drink
and take fits and starts and jumps after the
manner of Nero. . And not even Joseph’s
worst brother chases a girl round the room
and makes her leap for her life and honor
over the furniture, as Mercia is compelled
to do.

At Melbourne Princess’s the Soldier will
have his. last wedding on Friday, and next
night Allen Doone will reappear as the hero
of “The Wearing of the Green,” a gintle-
mahn who “believes in four.-leaved clovers.”
Meanwhile Doone is warbling in advt. verse.
“O Ireland, Ud from my heart of hearts I
bid you the top of the mornin’.”

One night last week Lupino was missing
from the panto, at Her Majesty’s, Mel-
bourne, and Rupert Darrell, the utility
emergency man of the co., was Ali Baba in
Lupino’s stead. Since when Rupert has
been rubbing ointment on the places where
he got bruised and barked in his efforts to
amuse. The entertainment still covers eight
performances, a week in its stride, and is a
winner all the time. Some people have been
heard to call “The Forty Thieves” a rotten
panto., but these are persons of perverted
taste, who would probably cast the same
aspersion on a new-laid egg.
** * *
Also “The Land of Nod” proclaimed its
50th occasion at Melbourne King’s last
Saturday night. The falls of Maud Chet-
wynd and Tom Cannam into the tank con-
tinue to be the moistest features of this
alleged fantasy, but the opportunity for a
more general immersion and a ballet of
mixed bathers has not yet been seized by
the management.

It seems that Mrs. Annie Besant will be
revisiting Melbourne —not in the flesh, but
in the spirit—this next Easter time. When
the three Cherniavsky brothers were in
Madras a while ago, Mrs. Besant came along
from Adyer, the headquarters of Theosophy,
to hear the young men make music. Or
nerhaps she came to see Maud Allan fiance,
for the press of India had boomed Maud
apropos of the suggestion that her clothing
was improper. Anyhow the theosophieal
lady booked a seat for the show, and became
entranced, more or less, by the violin playing

“Hamlet.” screened at West’s Melbourne
house on Saturday, gives Forbes Robertson
a chance to reveal the genius that is alleged
to repose within him. So far as the biq?-
graph shows, the English pro. is a satis-
factory Hamlet, though he apparently re-
fuses to commit himself on the point whether
the Dane wore real or imaginary straws in
his hair. Percy Rhodes, as'the Ghost, is
another feature of an important picture, and
Miss Gertrude Elliott-as Ophelia is all that
Propriety could desire. Pathe’s Australian
and English Gazettes get the most attention
in the rest of the programme, though “Master
Fixit,” a comedy Avith some humor about
it, runs these starters close.
The Romanos, who strike artistic atti-
tudes and depict the favorite punches of de-
parted pugs, are noAV accepting a large
salary from Melbourne Opera House man-
agement. Archille and Ares, equilibrists,
have arrived to demonstrate that they are'
second to the Pasqualis in the same line of
business; Avhile John B. Barton continues
to make a good living by falling down.
Frederick Hawley is still exposing the emo-
tional weakness of the Greaser nation, and
a few yards of biographic film are announc-
ing the appearance netxt Saturday of
Josephine Davis and her expensive clothes.
“Father of Fifty” : I am a house-hungry
paterfamilias desirous of renting,. for a
period, a bugless cottage in a quiet neigh-
borhood. After many weeks’ weary search-
ing of utterly unsuitable and absurdly ex-
pensive shacks, I got in touch with a par-
son who had the right thing at the right
price. He was out when I called. Consid-
erable correspondence passed between us,
my prospective landlord taking sedulous
care, in each of his letters, to place, in the
top left-hand corner, an appropriate scrip-
tural injunction: “The Lord succor and
keep thee.” His final communication, how-
ever, pointed out, in language unmistakable,
that he would not grant a tenancy if there
were any children in the family. This, to
one who, for the past 20 years, has been
replenishing the earth, was a cruel blow;
and I felt justified in writing at the summit
of my final letter: “Suffer little children to
come unto Me and forbid them not.”
Field-Marshal Evelyn W.ood, for five, fruit-
less j’ears the chairman of the City of Lon-
don assortment, has formally cut himself
adrift from the futile Territorials, remark-
ing as he did so that “he had never concealed;
his opinion that the military defence,of the
United Kngdom could only be secured by
the universal training of male adults.” This
ending, after five years’ hopest striving,
should be a stunner for the. “Terriers” or
Poodles, who have done their best, through
the ribald years, to look and perform like the
professional soldiers who despise them. In
these days of specialisation there is about,
as much use for the amateur soldier as there,
is for the amateur surgeon or actor, find the
aged Field-Marshal, who knows a finished
Avarrior when he,sees one, probably felt as
uncomfortable in his job as a well-meaning
prizefighter who has been called upon, in the
regrettable absence of the curate, to preside
at a mothers’ meeting.
From a hardened pressman :— ;
The Inter-State Commission has got to solid work
with its tariff inquiries. So far, its members have
been punctual, business-like and hard-grafting. Pid-
dington makes a particularly efficient chairman. He
is invariably urbane and quick to grasp an idea, and
is, apparently, the only one of the three Commis-
sioners who owns anything resembling a sense! of
humor. In examining a. witness, he contrives to
present the opposite side of the case, and argues
the matter'out, inviting the witness.to controvert his
(Piddington’s) arguments. This method generally
serves to bring to light the salient points on which a
witness relies to support his claim. Of the other
Commissioners, Lockyer is persistent and Swinburne
platitudinous. The former is as yet nervous, and his
hearing is not too good (which misfortune, by the
way, would have militated against “Billy” , Hughes
had he. obtained the chairmanship), .but his associa-
tion with the Customs has given him a remarkable
knowledge of tariff matters, and he has also a wide
general knowledge, which enables him to talk to a
trade witness as one expert to another. Gasman
Swinburne is soft arid ingratiating. His questions
are few, and thusfar rarely illuminating. On the
whole, to one who has spent days in its company, the
Commission appeals as being likely to prove a capable
and satisfactory sort of tribunal.

“Circle”: A daily paper dramatic critic lately com-
plained to me in this fashion: “If ever I happen to
say anything against one of Blank’s shows, I can
reckon' on about half a dozen of their men dropping
into the office to complain, or protest, or to try
and prove that I’m wrong. It used not to be so
years ago; but they don’t seem to be able to stand a
breath of criticism now.” Most press people will
be able to pick that management in one guess.
There is no more pathetic spectacle than that of a
theatrical representative trotting round moaning
vaguely about some allegedly harsh remarks made re
his little entertainment. It is a confession of weak-
ness and quite futile, for a criticism can’t be
recalled. How useless and how irritating is the
dramatic lamb’s habit of bleating a complaint every
time the wind of comment blows a little keenly. And
there is pathos about it if one remembers old times
when that management didn’t weep and lament,
though now and then it. did an elephantine curse or
a good upstanding denunciation.

later, after going ahead of various touring cos.,
managed the Dandies for Branscombe at Manly, has
been promoted to a place on the directorate of Brans-
combe, Ltd. Edward, the head of the firm, which
has now eight cos. either at work or in preparation,
will leave for the rest of the world in a few months,
presumably to look up new Dandies.
“M.E.”: May I intrude in the amiable discussion
between “M.L.” and “First-Nighter”? I’ve been
twice, but I haven’t seen the revue yet. What I
saw was the usual pantomime; the only difference
between, the revue and the panto, is that in the revue
there are fewer and feebler references to Australian
subjects than in the ordinary or Christmas panto. I
understood that a revue was a revue. What does
Daisy Jerome, the pearl of the revue, review? AVliat
Australian incident of the past year does the Tank
refer to? And where is the satire on the break of
gauge or on Johnson’s trains in the dead-heat between
the motor and the engine? AVhy the “Sumurun
Girl,” when we have never seen “Sumurun”? Why
should the Australian girl in the Manly carnival
dress in armor instead of in Canadians, and what in
particular has happened to the surf? Is the Spider’s
Web the Liberal League, and. Ivv Schilling the In-
dependent candidate? Is the Mississippi any con-
nection of the Murrumbidgee? Is Cannot meant to
be Burrinjuck Cannot? And is the nigger meant to
typify the Alien Restriction Act? Why doesn’t an
Australian revue review?
“Stargazer”: One night a dozen years ago I was
sitting in the stalls at Her Majesty’s, Melbourne,
when a tallish, elderly man, with a waterfall of white
whislsers striped with orange, came in and took the
vacant pitch next on my left. He proved a very
cordial gentleman, with a melodious brogue, and a
large - command of sonorous English. He entered
into conversation, and, being in, held the floor right
through the first act. In the interval we went out
t> get drinks at his suggestion. He entered the
bar like a man used to dominating bars, but did not
seem quite happy in the course of the whisky. In
fact, he was so concerned about something not visible
to my sense that he left me to pay for his shout.
My bearded ally talked through most of Act 2, and
then we went to get drinks on my suggestion. AVhile
we were drinking he was again looking expectant and
unhappy. “Has the beautiful town of Melbourrrrne been
extinct or quiescent these 20 years?” he asked. “Re-
spective ‘of what?” said I. “Has she learned
nothing?” asked he. We had another whisky. Then,
as the gentlemen filed from the bar he thumped
the counter mightily, and said he: “Has no one here
ivver heard of Dan O’Connor?” Then I realised —•
it was our Demosthenes.
Died lately in Sydney, Mrs. Eliza Banks, the
oldest professional contralto in the Commonwealth.
She passed out m her 87th year. For over 40 years
she was connected with the leading R.C. choirs of
the city, and succeeded Sara Flower as principal con-
tralto at the original St. Mary’s Cathedral, where her
husband, Thomas Banks, shook a stick in front of
the choir, while her eldest son struggled with the
organ.
Died the other week the French father of romantic
melodrama —one Ferdinand Dugue—who struck the
idea of staging marine “sensation” scene and tab-
leaux years before Dion Boucicault wrote “The Col-
leen Bawn.” Dugue, who lived to be 98, was the
author of “The Prayer in the Storm.” The princi-
pal scene in this famous old drama showed a ship-
wreck in Arctic seas. The vessel disappeared, and the
stage was covered with rolling painted ocean, after
which a eheeild was discovered perched, in an attitude
of prayer, upon a floating spar, or a chunk of iceberg.
The English translation of the drama had “The Sea
of Ice” for an alternative title. In one of its
revivals, at the old Adelphi, Genevieve AVard made
her first appearance in London just 40 years ago.
The female child who escaped from the wreck was
supposed to get landed on an island where the
savages adopted her. AVhen she was quite grown up
her long-lost relatives happened that way on another
ship. Genevieve AVard impersonated the heroine in
her grown-up period and looked rather too matured
for the part even 40 years ago.
London Telegraph on Christmas Eve had. a remi-
niscent two-column article on “The Clowns of Drury
Lane.” AA’illie Edouin,. a brother of the Mrs. G. B.
W. Lewis who ran the
Melbourne Bijou or Acad-
emy of Music in its early
years, was included in the
list; but he only climbed
in by the backstairs. In
the pantomime of 1856,
Drury Lane, for the first
and only time, tried the
experiment of a female
clown —a Mrs; Cuthbert.
But as she could not do
the tumbling and jumping
through windows, a
“handy youth,” made up
exactly like her; was em-
ployed for this part of
the business. The handy
youth was AVillie Edouin.
He and Mrs. Lewis were
both members of the
“E dou i n family” who
toured Australia in the
’so’s, and achieved popu-
larity on the goldfields. In
after years Willie blos-
somed into one of Lon-
don’s favorite comedians,
and made a good deal of
money—which he carefully
lost, so that his closing
years were penurious.
“Parisine” : AVhat has Bernhardt done to merit the
Legion of Honor? As an incomparable artist, she
ought to have remained at the National Theatre, the
Frangais, devoting herself to the masterpieces of such
as Corneille, Racine, Moliere, Voltaire, Crebillon,
Hugo and the Dumases, thus elevating public taste.
Then she would have merited national honor. Instead
of that, with an itch for money, her staple for 30
years has been an infinitely lower type of drama, and
she has dragged the public taste down. Quite
exceptional have been her high-class performances,
such as “Phedre,” “Hamlet,” De Musset’s “Loren-
zaecio” and Rostand's “Cyrano de Bergerac” and
“La Samaritaine.” Still she has been a bit better
than our own buttered Irving, whose record in
encouraging dramatists to produce something worthy
was quite miserable. He had such a profound horror
of paying authors’ fees that he would run a mile to
dodge a new masterpiece!
One firm of phonograph dealers is said to have
already sold 24,000 records of “You Made Me Love
You.” A Londoner expresses the hope that the firm
will soon break the record.
An indication of how J. Bull’s music-hall bosses
contrive to pav the salaries they are alleged to hand
out to H. Lauder, Marie Lloyd, Ada Reeve and others
is furnished bv some recent humble requests made by
the Cold Country ■TheatricaL'Employees’ .Union. These
cormorants are out after a minimum wage of 2s. 6d.
a night for “one-show” houses, and 3s. a night for
“twice-nightly” halls, the night’s work in both cases
running to 41 hours!
The George Willoughby programme-paragrapher,
speaking of Gertrude Boswell, says “she will be best
remembered by Australian theatre-goers as Stefanus
in ‘The Sign of the Cross’ with the late Wilson
Barrett.” Questionable whether any features of
Barrett’s production of “The Sign,” good as it was,
are well remembered. It was only a revival, during
the old battler’s second visit to Australia, of a
show which Williamson had worked for many months,
with Julius Knight, Ada Perrar and co., previous to
Barrett’s first visit. Subsequently there was a Wil-
liamson revival of “The Sign,” with Knight and
Maud Jeffries, and this time Unie Bussell (who
married Chia, the Chinaman) was the Stefanus.
Gertrude Boswell’s Stefanus came neither- first, nor
last in the recollection of Australian playgoers. She
happened here 11 years ago, and the ! people who do
remember her as the Early Christian boy in Nero’s
Rome can hardly recognise her as the heroine Of
Willoughby’s bellodramas. She lias a. beautiful speak-
ing voice and an unaffected earnestness, but there is
something of the Sundav-school teacher in Miss Bos-
well’s personality Which unfits her for the job of
poking the finger of scorn in the lurid villain’s eye,
as it were. ' *
“Private Boxer”: “Isn’t that dramatic?” “Harri-
son O.” triumphantly yells (B. 22/l/’l4), referrin'”-
to the amusing scene in “Man and Superman’’ (Act
I.) where the respectable married woman reveals her-
self as sich after all the characters have looked upon
her, and talked about her—especially talked about
her—as “a brazen, hussy.” Well, even if this one
episode were, dramatic, it would hardly prove that
“Man and Superman” was a play. But I deny, With
as much vehemence as I am capable of, that it is
dramatic. No dramatist worthy the name spoofs an
audience in that manner for the sake of a cheap
“surprise.” And- while- op the subject of this par-
ticular “play for Puritans,” I would ask “Harrison
0.” to glahde at the wordy description of the scene
of the first act. Shaw is particularly careful to in-
form us that “not a speck of dust is visible” in the
room. In a similar —only more sf> —description of
the scene in Act IV. (by the wav, why does “Harri-
son 0.” suggest that I went out after Act I. and never
returned? What people do .such things?) “Harrison”
will naturally look for a vivid description of “A
Garden in Granada,” and he will find these words:
“Whoever wishes to know what it is like must go to
Granada and see.” This is all very whimsical,. I
have no doubt, but is an author who takes playwriting
no more seriously than that to be judged a
dramatist. With regard to what “Harrison” calls
“the triangular scene” in “Candida,” we know from
the commencement of the act t.hat_ Candida has' been
bored to extinction during her tete-a-tete with her
Postlethwaite poet, and the' subsequent proceedings,
as Shaw conducts them (by means of the inevitable
“discussion”), interest us no more. Wherefore the
question argued by the parson, the wife and the bard
as to which of the two men the heroine prefers to
live with is about as grippy and dramatic as the
“Woman’s Page” of the S. M. H-fham. But why
continue? Shaw’s pieces are all alike —all Shaw ami
all talk. Bewilderingly clever talk some of it, so.
I’ll save them up for a rainy day—to read. As
acted drama they merely bore me. Does “G. 8.5.”
b»lieve himself to be the gifted dramatist his wor-
shippers represent him? Why, then, the special
pleading he indulges in in the new edition of “The'
Quintessence of Ibsen”? Says he: “The critics
protest in vain. They declare that discussions are
not dramatic, and that art should not be. didactic.,
Neither the playwrights nor the public take the
smallest notice of them.” AVell, one playwright may
not, but the public ? To conclude, as I should
not like “Harrison O.” to think I suffer habitually
from “comatose artistic perception,” let me. un-
grudgingly admit that “The Devil’s Disciple” is the
very best burlesque melodrama I have ever seen, or
ever hope to see.
“Harrison O.”: Gregan McMahon, of the Mel-
bourne Repertory Theatre, has found .that, Australian
prejudice against Australian art is as strong in some
nuarters as it is against, say, Australian boots.
AVhen McMahon has produced plays by Australian
writers he has lost many of. his regular patrons, and
some of his regular performers have refund to take
part. One of the latter when asked for her reason,
replied in a. tone of withering Contempt that she'
knew the avt’^r— “why, he. lives in the next suburb
to ours!” KcA r nhon has obtained audiences for his
Australian productions, but the people have; been
quite different from those who go into simulated
raptures over the work of foreign highbrows. He
intends to keep on affording local writers an oppor-
tunity of havmg their work staged, but the per-
formances will be kept separate from the regular
Repertory outbreaks, which will in future occur
at the Theatre Royal on Saturday afternoons. St.
Peter’s Hall is to be the Mecca of the home-grown
dramatist. McMahon now has on hand for early
production Arthur Adams’s “Mrs. Pretty and the
Premier” : “Quo A’adimus Femina,” by May AVil-
kmson, who wrote a prize “pome” in connection
with the AA’omen’s Work Exhibition a few years
ago; “The Image Breakers,” by Alf Buchanan, who
does the theatrical notices for the Age: “John.
Brandon, Scientist,” by Celia Manning; and a new
play, as yet unchristened, by Louis Esson.
The anonymous benefactor is often un-
satisfactory, but the very worst kind has
just transpired in England. She wrote say-
ing that she would give £25,000 to a King
Edward memorial. Later she wrote (still
anonymously) to say that she had lost most
of her money, and couldn’t spare a bean for
any King Edward memorial. Very pro-
bably her address all the time was the poor-,
house, and she was pulling the committee’s
leg in her old age, but anyhow she was con-
sidered worth a cablegram. ,
After a career of 67 ye.ars, the Sydney firm’
of John Mclntosh and Sons dissolves- and
retires from business. It was an old-
fashioned ironmongery house—as old-
fashioned as the late John Mclntosh, its
honorable founder, who stuck to the methods
of antiquity as to a creed.

“See Gee”: The British
Royal Commission on Divorce
has been getting busy, and if its
recommendations are followed
the U.K. should presently be
quite civilised in this respect.
At present its divorce laws are
well over half a century behind
the times. The Commission
advocates five new grounds for
untying the unwanted knot (all
of which Australia has had for
some time), and offers a few
practical suggestions with a
view to materially lessening the
present tremendous cost of ob-
taining a decree. Also, in a
general manner of speaking, it
advocates divorce being made
very much easier. But the pro-
posals are bound to have a
rough passage. The High
Church crowd, which is largely
represented in the House of
Gauds, will present an embit-
tered front to divorce reform,
and even if and when it is licked
it may be relied on
to present an in-
furiated stern to
the new law, and
to retire in good,
though scandalised
order, fighting
hard. The whole
of the Catholics,
many Nonconform-
ists, and a vast hevd of nondescript
Wowsers are also strenuous anti-
Divorceites —the R.C.’s on doctrinal grounds,
the others on the general principle
that “sin” should not be encouraged. These
latter are of the sort that would subscribe
to the villainous doctrine of the Vic.
Church of England Messenger, viz.:
“Those whom Nature hath afflicted with
syphilis let no man attempt to cure.”
As the drowning man clutched at the straw
to preserve his life, even so many bungs,
who were ordered to suspend operations as a
result of the 1907 and 1910 Local Option
polls in N. S. Wales, seek to preserve their
beerpumps with the help of a technicality
that doesn’t look much more substantial than
a wisp of cobweb. Since the polls were taken
most of the electorates have been remodelled,
so lots of the condemned houses are not now
in the electorates that pronounced the beer
pump’s doom. The proprietors of ’ these
hotels claim that they have nothing to do
with those hostile electorates any more, and,
having escaped, must be allowed to go free.
The landlord of the Windsor Castle, Taree,
therefore sold beer on January 1, which was
the day after the expiry of the license. He
was fined: but the magistrate, after weigh-
ing the ptas and cons., reckoned the doubt
large enough to go on to a higher court.
In Melbourne the aid of the police is get-
ting to be quite superfluous as regards the
capture of suspected housebreakers and the
restoration of stolen property to its lawful
owners. Not so long ago a sneak thief,
whose movements had been noted by a sub-
urban matron from the opposite side of the
road, was arrested by the lady’s husband, on
information received. She told him to
drive along in his buggy until he saw a
strange man, and the husband did so, and,
when he found the stranger, he pulled him
into the buggy and gave him to the first
policeman who happened on his way. It
was the very thief the detectives had been
looking for. Last week a casual passer-by in
Collins-place heard a watch ticking in a cis-
tern. The noise led to his finding a lot of
“planted” jewellery. This he handed to the
police, who proceeded—astute creatures —to
compare it with sundry descriptions of stolen
property. On the same day a citizen, awak-
ing from a doze in Fitzroy Gardens, chanced
to notice a handbag in the mouth of a drain-
pipe. Other handbags, one of them loaded
with jewellery, were also planted in the
drain, so the finder took the goods to the
police, who immediately conceived an Idea.
Two of them went and waited near the cul-
vert for the depositor to come in quest of
his booty. The first man who presented him-
self was “cleverly captured.” In neither of
the three cases was there any real necessity
for the police to figure, save as custodians of
suspects confided to their care. Everything
that was done could have been effected by
the thief-taker and the “swag” finders, with
the aid of the press. The man who detected
the handbag in the drain-pipe could just as
well have conspired with a mate to lie
around and capture the “planter” when he
appeared. All the plundered householders
would have been fetched along by a news-
paper paragraph to identify their property.
The police had no right whatever to a grain
of credit for the sensational arrests and dis-
coveries that were thrust upon them.
THE SPRINTERS.
"Theirs was a runaway match you know.
She ran away from her husband, and he
ran away from his wife.”
“Yes, and they look as if they were only wait-
ing to get their second wind before running
away from each other.”
A POINT OF AGREEMENT.
FATHER (to son, who is travelling-for the firm): “A r ow I hope yon are careful of your
conducl with the girls in these country hotels. In such places one can't be 100
PARTICULAR."
SON: "Just what I always say, Dad. In such places one can't be TOO particular. You've
got to take things as they come."
“Locust” explains why they come but
don’t stop:—
G.-O. Denman adds himself to the long line of
Governors who have shortened their own terms by
hari-kari, and the reason is obvious. He was in
England merely an ambitious young man, known for
some proficiency in polo, and with a small debating
society eloquence. Socially, of course, his name-
handle was open sesame. A political career was
possible through his seat in the House of Lords.
But an ambitious young man would look for a quicker
way of rising. A big pro-consulship offers a chance.
Of these there are now four of the first order: (1)
the Vice-royalty of Ireland, reserved for exceptional
men; (2) the Vice-royalty of India, a ticklish posi-
tion where statesmanship is also required; (3) the
Governorship of Canada, which is a sort of billet in
which judicious silence is the great essential, and
the deputy-throne at Ottawa, not being too far away
from Europe, can be sat upon by any big title-holder,
and even by a royal prince, without loss of personal
comfort; (4) the Gov.-Generalship of Australia,
which, Canberra being a long way off, involves a
considerable personal sacrifice on the part of the
incumbent and his womenfolk. There are also the
State Governorships, and the jobs of South Africa
and Maoriland, and the ruck of petty jobs like those
of the Falkland Islands and Newfoundland, but they
don’t cut ice much. A young, capable, receptive
man like Denman accepts the Australian position.
He is snatched from the nolo field, where he is a
distinguished figurehead, and from the House of
Lords, where he is nobody, and comes to Aus-
tralia. At once he is in a different atmosphere. He
finds a state of society in which all the political
leaders have forced themselves up from the depths
to the heights by sheer force of character, and with
no advantage of birth or social custom. He finds
Prime Ministers and leaders who, a few years ago,
while he was at the public schools or the gilded uni-
versity, were graduating in the coal-mine, the printing
office, the engineer’s workshop and the umbrella-
repairing business, or were exploring a virgin coun-
try, leading trades unions in and out of strikes, or
doing manual labor. Rubbing shoulders and brains
with these ought to be a great education to a man
of native ability; and it has been so in the case of
Denman. He has developed in a remarkable way.
With the advantages which he got from the start, he
can be something of a personage in England on his
return. He will have the prestige of a great pro-
consulship. He will have first-hand knowledge and
experience of industrial and political problems which
have been wrestled with here in all manner of new
ways. When these problems ripen in England he
can, if he pleases, be an authority full of wise saws
and modern instances. Meanwhile he and his women-
folk will no longer be exiles. They will be back in
London, and London is a town which has compensa-
tions even for a man who has been evicted from
Sydney. There are many others who would willingly
exchange the shores of the Harbor Not-So-Beautiful-
As-It-Was for the banks of the hoary Thames.
Tom Johnson, for five years past autocrat
of N. S. Wales railways, leaves Australia
next week, and for some days past various
people have been farewelling him and telling
him as little as they could of what they
really thought about him. Johnson is pro-
bably a very good railway engineer. But
as a railway manager he has been the larger
part of a failure, first, because when he
came and for a long while afterwards lie
knew nothing about the conditions of the
country whose business he had to do, and,
second, because his stock of tact was worth
about tuppence. He didn’t always have time
to be civil because he was too busy doing
the - things that other men could have done
better. He worked long and hard hours
himself, and he made others work long abd
hard hours, not because either he or they
had too much work to do, but because he
consumed vast quantities of his time and
theirs in discussing details which would
shave been far better dealt with if the speci-
alists hadn’t had so much of their time ab-
in travelling to and from Johnson’s
.offiqe and waiting on his doormat. Probably
he buffered from too much conscience: N. S.
Waives paid him a far bigger salary than he
had ever got before, and he seems to have
thought he couldn’t earn it if he let any
othey officer rr-ke any runs off his own bat.
Hence, if Johnson so much as took a few
days’ trip to Maoriland, he had to be fol-
lowed up with long wires presumably ex-
plaining that the Melbourne express hadn’t
created a sensation by running to time, and
that the youngest junior porter had cleaned
out passenger-waggon C 192 satisfactorily.
Johnson gave himself a heap of unnecessary
trouble. Somebody had evidently told him
in his youth that genius consisted of an in-
finite capacity for taking pains, and
apparently nobody else told him the better
thing—that genius in a manager consists of
an infinite capacity for making other people
take them.
BLANK VERSE AND BLANKER VERSE.
[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
Sermons in blank verse are the latest innovation
into the church service, introduced by the Rev. Janies
Silvester, M.A., vicar of Great Clacton (England).
Here are some extracts from the first sermon
Then passed a Levite also by tbe place
Where lay the wounded traveller nigh to death.
He came and gazed upon the painful scene
As though the priest had told the truth to him
That he might help his Temple brother still,
And do the duty that belonged to both.
But what the priest would not, could he not do,
And thought, perchance, the man as good as dead.
— Dail// paper.
Now listen to my version— Me.
A certain merchant went to Jericho,
Down limestone roads from old Jerusalem,
And there were thieves, fell, on the barren ground,
And these, both crying “Up, blackguards, and at
him!”
Upsprang and choked him well! Ah, well, a day !
’Twas meet they did it, for they were an hungered,
And he they choked a stake held in the country.
So went they through him to the generation
That follows on the second; robbed they him;
Left him for dead all bruised and sore with beating.
Then came a Levite, and his name was Cohen,
And he, seeing the fallen, looked this way and that;
And seeing none to hinder, stole his boots,
Gave him a kick for luck, and went his way.
Lo! to that grassy shambles at the hour
Came a Samaritan, a noble bloke,
Who never told a lie —except on business ;
Who never stole a pin—except in secret;
W'-.o never drank too much—except on Sundays.
He, seeing the pale person from Jerusalem,
Sat down, and wept; and tore his hair, and shouted,
Then bound up many wounds, so that he looked
Less like a human sieve than heretofore.
Then he of soft Samaria wept again—-
Moist humid benefactor he, though faithful—-
He put the man on his unwilling ass,
And toted him along to a caravanserai
(Where it was notified “All Drinks are Sixpence”)
And took him off his ass, and said aloud —
Taking, of course, the centre of the stage—-
“See ye this man so very badly wounded ?
Him have I rescued from the Jaws of Hell.
Take ye him, give him of the finest linen
Kill the plump cockerell; and the cobwebbed wine
Pour for him till the bubbles bead the rim ;
Give ye him beer and oil and best of lodging;
His wholesome welfare be your charge and peril ;
Spare no expense, do all things very well ;
And when 1 come again this way, I’ll pay thee”—
And this he said to signify to them
That they should see his pitying face no more.

Crepe Pyjamas
COOL and COMFORTABLE.
Tokio Crepe is a material particularly suitable for Pyjamas,
because it is so light and porous and becomes very soft
after washing. We feature Crepe Pyjamas in various stripe
effects —the designs being on light and dark grounds. Each
garment is cut to liberal proportions for comfort, and is
shaped so that it sets correctly. We commend Crepe
Pyjamas for long service.

Last week the siren picture show on the
Cronulla (N.S.W.) ocean beach dazzled the
freight steamer Wear on to the sands, in the
belief that it was headed straight for the
entrance to Sydney Harbor. Luckily the
Wear isn’t a very big ship, and had a few
hundred tons of water ballast, which, being
pumped out, enabled it to escape at flood
tide and steam safely to port. The piciure-
show lights which flash over the north and
south deep-sea tracks are to be looked at,
and, if considered dangerous to navigation,
they will be masked on the seaward side, or
otherwise altered, so that mariners won’t
mistake them for the Macquarie light on the
South Head cliffs. This is satisfactory.
But, in Sydney Harbor itself, the jumpy
illuminations about Snakejuice Whisky,
Bumbleehook’s Peerless Wine and Poodle’s
Extra Trousers Free still blaze nightly for
the confusion of ferry captains, who are
expected to whisk their hundreds of pas-
sengers to and fro at railway speed. The
rule seems to be that the accident must
always happen before something is done.

Australia is getting some immigrants that
England evidently didn’t want. At the
Criminal Sessions in Adelaide one John
Waterhouse pleaded guilty to two charges of
forgery. The sole plea he had to make was
that he “only came from England last
year”—which was a mistake in tactics, as
the police showed that he had made such
bad use of his time that he had already been
convicted in Sydney and in Newcastle.
There is still a firm idea in the Cold Coun-
try that, if anyone of “gentlemanly” man-
ners goes wrong, and you don’t like to gaol
him, the “Colonies” are an ideal dumping-
ground for him to start a New Life. The
trouble is that in most cases he doesn’t.
He just continues the old one; and the
expense of his gaoling and his keep falls
on Australia —if he comes here. If he goes
to Canada, he mostly gets shot, to the great
though unexpressed relief of his family. A
dead prodigal is like a retired boxing cham-
pion ; he can’t Come Back.

“A.”:—
How these R.C. foundations do grow! The Mel-
bourne Sisters of Charity present a case in point.
The Order was founded in 1889, by seven sisters
from the Sydney mother house. It started humbly in
Albert-street. There are 70 sisters now, and they
control St. Patrick’s School, Victoria Parade; St.
John’s, East Melbourne; St. Joseph’s, Collingwood ;
St. John’s, Clifton Hill ; St. Monica’s in Essendon ;
and St. George’s, Carlton. They are also responsible
for St. Columba’s College in Essendon. But their
greatest score was in connection with the East Mel-
bourne College. They managed to buy the Chalmers
Presbyterian Church, and built its very stones into
their splendid learning factory. And then there is
their monumental work —St. Vincent’s Hospital.
Here they swallowed a Congregational Church, which
is likewise included with their scheme. St. Vin-
cent’s Hospital began with 18 beds; it now has 120.
During the year ending June, 1913, there were 2728
patients treated in the wards, and 19,152 out-
patients. The Sisters replaced another Congregational
Church with Mount St. Evins Private Hospital.
The latest idea in out-door entertainments
in Melbourne is the lawn bathing party.
The new joy combines the exhilaration of
THE TEST.
HE : " Why do you think he is so original?
You only spoke to him for two minutes."
SHE : “Yes; but fie never asked me had I
been vaccinated."
A GIVING EXAMPLE.
NEW GOVERNESS: “The saving, 'T he good die young,' Katie, must not be taken literally."
KATIE (who has been reprimanded): “Of course not. Why, YOU are over forty!"
mixed bathing with the more sober ritual of
two-stepping in the open. The assembled
guests assume appropriate bathing garments,
and gambol on the lawn, while the host’s
family or hired attendants damp the merry-
makers by means of a hose —throwing a fine
but vigorous spray. Music is not necessary
to the task of making a rapturous night of
it in this way; but where a band or piano
is in attendance the guests two-step it all
the more gaily on the sward. This latest of
many inventions is catching on, and if, when
passing a St. Kilda or Kew family mansion,
you find night echoing the chortles of strong
men and the giggles of fair women, you
will know that the host with the hose has
got ’em wet.
“M.L.”: The Eng-
lish and the Jap are
much alike; but, even
so, why should the
Australian take on the
superstition of the
Chow? On the last
..'night of an old year
there probably isn’t
an Australian town
that doesn’t break into
howls, thus unknow-
ingly copying the
Chinese habit of
frightening devils off
the New Year with
fireworks and lunatic
sounds. Humorless
idiots blow trumpets,
horns and mouth-
organs ; flour-throwing
fools invite grievous
punches on the nose;
asses yell “Auld Lang
Syne” for 15 minutes
without stopping—it
is shriek and roar and
yell and noise and
general hell. If
the Australian doesn’t
soon cultivate a sense
of humor, he’ll be
taken for an English-
man.

A number of the St.
Ivilda (Melb.) rate-
payers are said to be
“urging the local
Council to stop bath-
‘ ing on Sundays.” It
is not clear that all
memoers of the Coun-
cil make a practice of bathing on week-days.
Maybe Sunday is their day of wash.

The periodical young woman with the un-
becoming tale has happened again in Mel-
bourne. She hastened into the Malvern police
station late on a Sunday night, and stated
that, after attending a Salv’army service, she
was proceeding soberly to her lodgings when
five young men. whom she minutely de-
scribed and said she could identify, stopped
her and assaulted her, leaving her reft of her
purse—and lots besides. She was so cir-
cumstantial that the Law began to view the
members of a local “push” with loud suspi-
cion, and had ticked off the five who an-
swered the descriptions when it occurred to
someone to investigate the damsel herself.
She was escorted to the scene of the alleged
assault, and invited to point out the exact
spot and give other details. Then she col-
lapsed and admitted it was all a piece of fic-
tion, invented to account for the loss of her
purse. The ’tecs are understood to have
“cautioned” the imaginative lady; but the
case really calls for a little of that cold stone
jug to which she very nearly condemned five
innocent men.

Luck is a thing you absolutely can’t dodge.
If it is to get you it will. If there is any
one occupation in this world that could be
guessed to Jbe free from danger, it is the
lifting of tripe out of a bucket with a stick.
Yet a Renmark (S.A.) butcher has been
arievouslv injured while doing just that.
The weisrht broke the stick, and the upper
half of it flew up and sheared the man in
the eye.
It is difficult to be a dignified modern
king by reason of sycophants and cable-
grammers. No man is heroic while he is
cutting his corn, and if some fool insists
on letting the whole world know that
he has cut his corn he is made to appear an
object of mirth, whether he is one or
not. Even the Apostle Paul would have
looked mean if his press agent had tele-
graphed to the Romans a full account of his
hollow tooth, and a narrative of how his
boots in Macedonia were late of coming back
from being repaired on Saturday night, so
that he couldn’t preach in them on Sunday.
Poor Alfonso of Spain is said to be a well-
meaning little character, and perhaps he
didn’t deserve what the cable-fiend ’said
about him last week. It had been snowing
in Madrid, and Alfonso, it is reported, hung
up his crown and the long tail of his pedi-
gree, and went forth in a grey suit and a
soft felt hat —not a green and red suit and
a fireman’s helmet —to see if the place looked
any cleaner than usual. The. Court, it is
alleged, was terrified when it learned thai
he was walking about alone amid public-
houses and fruit barrows and other tempta-
tions. And his Majesty had at least one wild
adventure, for a Spanish citizen —probably a
perfectly harmless person in the drapery
business, and the father of a family, whoso
only crime was that he had run out of
matches —asked him for a light. The King
gave him a light, and nothing desperate hap-
pened except that both parties walked on.
Kings are a mild crowd nowadays, and when
cable-historians represent it as a staggering
incident that his Majesty supplied a light,
they are made to look like faded old spin-
sters of the kind that do crochet by candle-
light, with the cat for company. There was
a time when these potentates were less re-
spectable, but a lot more imposing, and some
of them really worked for their money.
Twelve centuries ago Spain had an upstand-
ing monarch about whom the court intelli-
gence used to record that he wasn’t any
drunker yesterday than the day before, and
that he hadn’t stolen anybody’s wife since
last Tuesday. The last paragraph about
him mentioned that his Majesty had put up
a better scrap against the invader than his
previous thirst and bigamy would have led
people to expect, but on the sixth day of the
battle an axe had scattered his brains—
which nobody thought he possessed—all over
the place; also that his body was missing,
and most of his family were dead, and the
army couldn’t be found, and the throne was
vacant, and the kingdom was lost, and the
nigger was in possession, and it was all up.
In those days there was at least some pomp
about being a king. And in all that six
days’ battle nobody asked King Roderick if
he had a match on him.
GENEROSITY.
CLERK : “If you please , sir, it's awfully cold
this weather. Can't I have a stove?"
ISAACSTEIN : “ Thertainly, thertainly. But

cheaper then."
Melbourne bayside dwellers and campers
are once more in trouble. The other day
Chelsea was half burnt out through some
fool authorities having failed to make provi-
sion for firebreaks. Now Carrum, a mile
further on, has discovered that most of it,
having bought seaside homes and week-end
bungalows, gets no'thing for its money but a
distant view of the bay. The same old inept
authorities carelessly allowed Private Enter-
prise to sell every inch of the narrow strip be-
tween the township and the beach, and, when
the last vacant allotment was sold and fenced
in, Carrum discovered that, if it wanted a
bath, it would have to take a long walk
round this strip or go without. Of course
Carrum was annoyed, but it got simply furi-
ous when it found that, for a couple of strips
of sand, to give it access to the water, the
owners demanded £10 a foot.

Brethren, let us bow down at the blessed shrine of
Things To Eat!
Let us unite in a soaring paean of praise for expen-
sive Swill!
Let us salute Assorted Meat,
The chaste Entree and the sacred Sweet —-
Let us lift up our fatted feet
And, humbly bending the knee,
Show thus our love for Poulet Roti !
Brethren, give praise for well-fed days and the gor-
geous nights that are food ful still !
Fellow-elect, as we now approach the altar of holy
Scran,
Let us be glad for the truths revealed to us in the
Cookery-book !
Which makes of the cook —oh, more than man,
With his sanctified ladle and broiling-pan,
And his faithful, abiding tomato-can !
Let’s genuflect at the proper time
Tn the presence of new burnt-offerings prime,
With a solemn sniff at the ever-uplifting odor of
roasted chook !
Come, now, give thanks to the cook amid the incense
of duck long-dead !
Let us draw near to the holy cheer with a manner
that’s most devout!
Let’s sing a psalm of our daily spread—-
Of the hurrying helpers who lightly tread
In cloth-top boots where The Best are fed ;
Of the kindly creatures who stand and wait
To handle one’s hat at the heavenly gate!
Brethren, obeisance for Reverend Food—the portion
of righteous Stout!

LEMMON,
OF THE
VIC. LABOR
PARTY .
John Estell, Minister for Labor, and
Fred Flowers, Vice-President of the Execu-
tive Council, ift the reconstructed N. S.
Wales Ministry, were first introduced to
Parliamentary life by George Iieid, in 1899.
He was then moving the Leg. Council to pass
his income-tax proposals, and amongst a
sizeable batch of new councillors appointed
to put a shoulder to the wheel were Flowers
and Estell. They were the first Labor
M’s.L.C. in the Ma State.
“Melb” pulls down the shutters:—
John Cleeland, for so many years of the Albion
Hotel, in Bourke-street, has passed away, at New-
haven, Phillip Island, aged 87. A native of County
Down, he arrived in Victoria as early as 1840, and
lived first at Whittlesea, where his father owned a
farm. John embraced a seafaring life, and soon was
owner of the schooner Harriet, trading to the South
Seas. His dart was limejuiee, made aboard from
fruit obtained on the islands. Retiring from the
ocean in 1859, he rented the Albion from Condell
Melbourne’s first Mayor. The Albion was the starting
place of Cobb’s coaches, with which George Watson,
the prince of starters, and Clapp, of the fur cap’
were associated. Later, he bought 7000 acres on
Phillip Island, and bred Shetland ponies. His home
was there, at Wollomai, Newliaven—he had owned
Wollomai, winner of the Melbourne Cup in 1875.
He had won the Australian Cup, too, in 1868, with
the filly Shenandoah, named after the Confederate
war steamer, whose officers once put up at the
Albion in John’s day.
THE BYGONE JAG.
WELLINGTON, Thursday.—lnterviewed in reference
to the cable announcing a further 4½-million loan,
Mr. Massey, the Dominion Prime Minister, said
they had to raise an unusually large sum of money
this year by reason of the fact that so many short-
dated debentures would fall due between now and
December.

MAORILAND: “No! Interest on the last one!"
There has been a slumD in Gaud Mayor
stocks in Sydney lately. After Allen Tay-
lor’s long run, Alderman Clarke was deco-
rated with the official rabbit hair. He had
just inaugurated the unsheathed hatpin
crusade and the wind-blown tram ticket
pursuit when he was shown the door, and
after remarking coldly that it was a mighty
poor sort of door he went through it and
left. Into the chair went Cocks, M.L.A.
He faded out in the midst of a loud whoop
concerning the general clean-up he was going
to make. Now Richards is holding forth
about some improvements he intends to per-
form if he gets a chance. The other day
Allen Taylor- sought to get back to the
Council by contesting the seat from which
Cocks resigned. He was also shown the
door, and he opined in his inmost soul that
it should be broken up for firewood.
_ Colonel Otter, of Canada, who has been
giving his countrymen curried tongue for re-
fusing to take adequate measures for self-
defence, was the large and tempestuous offi-
cer commanding the much-boosted Ist Cana-
dian regiment in S’Africa—the crowd which
turned Cronje’s flank at Paardeburg, and,
later, mutinied at Pretoria. Before this latter
accident occurred the regiment had turned
the flank of a distillery, and the whisky
vat, being surrounded, had surrendered at
discretion. Not even Otter’s mana and flow
of language could stay his command’s in-
finite insobriety.
Passed over, at Christchurch (M.L.), on
January 21, and by a queer irony of fate
as the result of an operation, Dr. A. C. De
Renzi, who, 12 or 15 years back, was one of
the most favored surgeons in the Great
Loan Land. He was born in London 49
years ago, and took his degrees there in
1885. Shortly afterwards he moved to
Christchurch, where he gained a great repu-
tation as an operator. It was commonly al-
leged that he could remove most of the
interior of a patient in the midst of a casual
conversation, and without attracting the
patient’s attention. His off-hand manner
prevented him from becoming popular; but
his supreme skill with the knife caused
sufferers to flock to him from all parts until,
in 1899, a dissatisfied person hurled a writ
at him for alleged unskilful practice. After
a sensational case De Renzi got the verdict,
but the worry and the amount of money
devoured by ravenous costs rattled him. He
rushed away to the farm-burning in Chowth
Africa, and did great work there in the
field hospitals. When the last farm had
been burnt, he accepted a Government
medical post in India; but in 1909 he
drifted back to Christchurch, and practised
there until the call came to him to go on
the operating table himself.
The drabbest recent thing on the W.A.
goldfields is the result of an attempt to
make a splash over Bigjohn Forrest’s visit
to the Kalgoorlie end of the transcontinental
line. The old warhorse, who in the early
days did so much for the goldfields, is now,
mostly because of his unfortunate associa-
tion with Cook, regarded as an intruder.
When, therefore, Mayor Cuthbush, of Kal-
goorlie. called a meeting to arrange an en-
tertainment, the enthusiastic crowd that
turned up consisted of a couple of auction-
eers and a publican or two.
'‘Mr. Ocky” calls for silence in the court:
Read Murphy, P.M., of Geelong, goes to the Mel-
bourne City Court in place of the well-groomed
Morrison. The drunk of the bloated city will wonder
what has struck him the first time the magistrate
with the brogue-name sends him up for 12 months.
If he follows his Geelong practice, Murphy (who, by
the way, never laughs) will also insist on the parks
being cleared of the sweethearts who tell each other
of their love in the dark, and when they come before
him he will address them on morality after the
manner of Madden, C.J. Let no witness prevaricate
in Murphy’s court —Murphy being the judge of what
is or isn’t prevarication. Nor put his hat on before
reaching the door, for Murphy is particular about his
door. The magistrate, by the way, is something
of an author, and wrote, among other things, “Beyond
the Ice.” For that act he deserves to be fined ss.
Creswell, one bf the S’African Labor
leaders, is a brother of the Australian Ad-
miral and a pupil of the South Kensington
School of Science. He got a diploma as
engineer, and was manager of the Roode-
poort mine when the Boer War started. He
volunteered in the Imperial Light Horse,
was in action at Ladysmith and Mafeking,
and afterwards was in the Railway Staff
Corps. When the war ended he became
manager of the British Main Reef Mine.
S’African events were, however, driving him
into the camp of the advanced Democrats ;
and when the management wanted to intro-
duce Chinese he flung up his billet, which
was worth £3OOO a year. Going to Eng-
land, he supplied Campbell-Bannerman with
much valuable information, and fortified his
friend, Colonel Seely, the present War Min-
ister, who was an enemy of the Chinese
policy. Back in the Transvaal, he entered
Parliament on the Labor ticket, and became
leader. Outside S’Africa he has had mining
experience in South America and Asia
Minor’.
HIS CLARKESHJT OF MELBOURNE.
George Reid told them at Ballarat the
other day that he was 18st., and proud of
it. No doubt it is good politics to make the
best of a bad job; still there was a time
when George made strenuous efforts to re-
duce his superfluous bulk, even going to the
extent of rolling industriously on barrels,
a method supposed at the time to be infal-
lible. Having found it impossible to plane
down his abnormal disproportions, George,
like many other fat men, resolved to make a
virtue of obesity. Once he had great faith
in fat-dissolving drugs, too; now he has
none; and his girth is a standing refuta-
tion of the idea that faith will move moun-
tains.
Died last week, aged 61, Thomas Davis,
one of the best-known public accountants in
Sydney. Accountants divide themselves into
two classes —-one, those who are something
of brokers also, inasmuch as, probing a pro-
position which lacks capital, they are pre-
pared to hustle and get some; the other,
those who state their opinion on the facts
and leave others to do the fishing with the
bait supplied. “Tom” Davis, being a vigor-
ous man with a persuasive manner, wasn’t
content to merely provide the opinions; he
roped in capital also, and pretty often had
a finger or two in the management of the
concern afterwards. Finney Isles, of Bris-
bane, and Nicholson’s, of Sydney, were among
the big things he handled of late years. Pro-
fessionally, having made his diagnosis, he
could write you a beautiful report on your
rotten concern, and you wondered how you
had overlooked so many virtues in it; but it
was always best to leave off before you got
to the end—the sting was in the tail. By
way of recreation, he was a good citizen who
left off carting the stones of his own financial
business to carry the bricks of the Nurses’
Club, and he gave a helping hand with the
Ambulance Brigade and other agencies for
the relief of human suffering.
Honor Moore is the name of the co-
respondent in a Soustralian divorce case. Did

THE COLLECTORS OF THE CASH.
BRISRANE Tuesday.—The Treasurer stated to-day
that a communication had been sent from his Depart-
ment to the Commonwealth Government, asking
if it would be convenient for the Queensland Govern-
ment to pay back the half-million loan before the
date of maturity. No reply has so far been received.

Parson Dill Macky, of Sydney, after a long

of Rome, died worth only £1220 11s. 4d. A
great many Popes have left more money than
that.
General-manager A. P. Stewart retired
last week from (he service of what used to
be the A.J.S. Bank and is now the Aus-
tralian Bank of Commerce. For 20 years
he had about the rottenest job in Australia.
Among the big banks the A.J.S. exploded
with the most violence (always barring the
one that exploded worst of all) ; and, partly be-
cause the management was old and decrepit,
the work of cleaning up the mess dawdled
on year after year, and the staff got tired,
and the men with most push dropped
out, and the premises developed white ants
and cobwebs, and new and profitable busi-
ness declined to commit itself- to people
who seemed too dead to handle it. During
most of these years Stewart was chief in-
spector ; that is to say, he had the job of
telling officers who deserved more salary
that they couldn’t have it, and the other
job of informing the man with the mort-
gage that if the overdue interest wasn’t
paid the worst would happen. Also, to dis-
courage the depressed shareholder and the
angry depositor, he hid himself up two
flights of dark stairs, where he brewed
coffee to comfort his nerves, and tried to
banish care by furtively writing verses on
his blotting-pad. So, since very few people
saw those verses, he srot the reputation of
being a hard, cold, bowelless man; and it
hurt him, because it wasn’t just. Finally,
his chance arrived: he became general-
manager, and, with some new people
to back him up, he at once got to the big
work of reconstructing the bank, and
finished it three or four years ago, and has
well earned his rest. The new man is
Shannon, an Australian, with many years
experience on the other side.
At a sliivoo given by the officers of the
N.S.W. Attorney-General’s Department, to
farewell Holman and welcome D. R. Hall,
the latter took occasion to propose the
health of probably the oldest public servant
in the State —H. W. Hargreaves, Taxing
Officer in Equity. Mr. Hargreaves, who is
son of the alleged discoverer of gold in
N. S. Wales. Edmund Hammond Hargreaves,
is in his 75th year, and has been contimn
ously in the service since 1857 —just on 57
years.
REFORMING PA.
[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
Judge Docker holds strong views on questions of
morality, and this afternoon, at the Darlinghurst
Quarter Sessions, his Honor made some remarks that
show unmistakably he does not approve of the matri-
monial laws as they at present exist.
“My impression is,” added his Honor, “that adul-
tery should be made a criminal offence, as it was
under the ancient Jewish law.” —Sydney Sun.
Poor Pa is being flogged to-day! You know that
maid we had ?
Of course, I shouldn’t say it, dear, but she was really
bad!
And Pa admired her shamefully! Of course, she
led him on ;
But Ma was furious when she found how far the
thing had gone.
She thought at first she’d let it pass, but, after
what she saw,
She thought it only right to hand Pa over to the
Law.
And, though it hurts her dreadfully , she’s quite
made up her mind
She’s only being harsh to Pa in order to be kind.
Poor Pa, you know, has often broken out like this
before;
And poor Ma very naturally thinks it a dreadful
bore.
We’ve had some fearful times with him! He did
not seem to care
What people said or thought of him, but, with the
cheekiest air,
Went trapesing round with any cat that took his
fancy. That’s
Where all Pa’s money went, my dear! —just thrown
away on cats!
But now we’re hoping Pa will be, oh! quite a
diff’rent Pa,
And stay at home and write nice cheques for us
three girls . and Ma.
Ma has to be kept up, you know ! She breaks down
now and then
Whenever she imagines Pa with all those warder
men
Preparing for the whipping. But we tell her not
to fret,
And dab some powder on her nose. I think she must
regret
Informing on dear Pa. But, there! ’twill do dear
Daddy good,
And afterwards he’ll stay at home just as a Daddy
should,
And hose the lawn and smoke his pipe in peace
outside the door,
And never look at housemaids, or be silly any more !
N.s.w.
HOPEFUL GERTIE.

This is another of the banks which suffer in present
dividends from the good fault of having too much
capital. Down to the days of the boom the share-
holders had put up £600,000, £lOO,OOO of it having
been subscribed just when the financial drunk was
most willing. The smash followed, and, in the search
for an easy way out, 20 p.c. of the deposits were
given the chance to turn themselves into 5 p.c. pref.
shares, with a right to come in with ordinaries for
divs. beyond that. This brought in £416,760 of
new capital. Also, the ordinary capital was carried
up to £1,061,250 ( £lO shares paid to £5), thus
making the total £1,478,010, or nearly two and a
half times more than it was before the boom. This
offers most excellent protection to depositors ; on the
other hand, it takes a lot to pay an extra 1 p.c.
dividend on capital of that size, wherefore the climb
up to even 6 p.c. has been slow, and a rapid sprint
up towards the old 10 and 12 p.c. is practically
impossible. Nevertheless, with such good backing of
capital, a steady increase of deposits ought to be
assured ; and, given good management and fair trade
conditions in Australia, that ought in its turn to
mean steadily increasing profits. The bank cer-
tainly has made reasonable, if not very rapid, pro-
gress so far. Take a comparison : —-
1903. 1913.
Deposits .. ..£4,574,183 £6,480,245
Advances .. . . 4,693,699 6,083,542
An increase in 10 years of close-up 50 p.c. of de-
posits, allowing of an increase of nearly 1$ millions
of advances, shows that the bank isn’t in the back-
wash.
The most serious complaint in the past has usually
been that this bank kept its till too empty through
letting out too much of the public’s money. In that
respect matters have improved of late. But take
these figures first: —
Liabilities.

Bills, etc 456.741 461,230 Inc. 4,489

Premises . . . . 367,378 354,481 Inc. 12,897
So, while deposits have decreased, liquid assets have
increased; and thus there is now 33 p.c. of the
liabilities in liquid shapes—not a high enough pro-
portion under ordinary circumstances, but fairly
satisfactory in view of the comparatively small
amount of the current account deposits. In propor-
tion to the shareholders’ funds in the business, the
deposits, etc , are still small, though they have, as
shown above, increased substantially of late years.
For every £1 that belongs to the shareholders there
is £3 15s. that belongs to the public; and the pre-
sent capital is quite strong enough to stand another
£2,000,000 or more. Mainly, no doubt, because the
bank has the use of so comparatively little public
money, the earnings calculated on capital and
reserves combined are rather poor:—
£ s. d. . £ s. d.
Dec., 1908.. 518 9 p.c. | Dec., 1911.. 614 4 p.c.
June, 1909.. 5 18 4 „ I June, 1912.. 6 19 8 „
Dec., 1909.. 5 17 2 „ | Dec., 1912.. 7 10 5 „

Dec., 1910.. 6 0 3 „ | Dec., 1913.. 6 15 3 „
June, 1911.. 6 7 0 „ |
However, though the earnings are only 6f p.c., while
the dividend is 6 p.c., the reserves are so substantial
that the 0j p.c. earned on that part of the funds
provides a fairly satisfactory lay-by—which would, by
the way, be better for the past half-year than the
table shows had not £2OOO of profit been wisely
handed over to the Officers’ Provident Fund.

Fifteen p.c. sounds beautiful; but it really isn’t as
beautiful as all that. In 1903-4, when things were
pretty gloomy in Australia, the heavens having run
out of rain, the assets of this boom-battered concern
were revalued; and, as a result, each £5 pref.
share was changed into one pref. share of 30s. and
one deferred share of 55., and each £5 ordinary
share became a Is. ordinary share. So the 15 p.c.
on ordinaries is really one-hundredth part of 15
p.c. on the original ordinary capital. It was a fair
thing to leave the ordinaries with some interest in the
concern, because it was possible that the assets might
recover something of their old value; and in order
that they might get a direct benefit, it was arranged
that monevs realised in excess of the written-down
values should be passed to a special fund to attach
to tiie deferred and ordinary shares. So far, this
has been the result:—

Practically this means that £91,902 of the written-
off capital has been restored, making .with the
deferred capital ( £29,000) and the ordinary capital
( £3406) a total of £124,308. The 15 p.c. div.
is equal to a shade under 4 p.c. on this amount, and
that isn’t extravagant. Yet even then there isn’t
anything left over for reserves; but matters would
have looked better in that respect if the Land Tax
Department hadn’t intimated that the bank was
liable for tax on properties which it holds as “mort-
gagee in possession,” and had called on it for
ji1495 of arrears.
Coming to details, the progress (or otherwise)
made since the revaluation is shown hereunder: —

Good progress has been made in getting rid of the
old dead-horse properties, and “the directors believe”
that the £91,902 of surplus realised “will be very
considerably increased by the sale of the remaining
properties at reasonable prices.” But the building
up of a practically new business, apart from this
■liquidation job, seems to be a tough proposition.
Properties of a book value of £255,304, and of. an
actual value of (say) £345,000, have been sold, and,
arently, no satisfactory new outlet could be found
for the whole of the money, so that a large amount
of fixed deposits have been repaid. At present the
bank has £305,556 of its own money in the business,
while liabilities of all kinds (deposits, etc.) total
only £286,045. And more than half the liabilities
could be wiped out with liquid assets. This means
that the security for depositors is extraordinarily
good; but it also means that the bank is making
mighty little out of the use of other people’s money.

The accounts allege that the net profits for the past
half-year were £16,327 “after making provision for
depreciation, etc.” ; which, being put into plain lan-
guage, means that, in the opinion of the directors, it
isn’t good for you to know what the real profits were.
However, they throw into the “reserve for deprecia-
tion, public risk and contingencies” an extra £ 500 ;
and that £5OO being added to the dis-
closed profit makes the £16,827 mentioned in the
table. But that “reserve for depreciation, etc.,” isn’t
the only provision for depreciation ; this is pretty
well proved by the fact that the directors now pro-
pose to capitalise practically the whole of that
reserve —a good enough intimation that wear and
tear has all along been provided for by the direct
writing-down of assets, or (which amounts to the
same thing) bv the purchase of new assets out of
undisclosed profits.
Daily paper correspondents, writing lately, have
mentioned the money they paid for shares, and have
declared that, on their experience, Sydney Ferries
isn’t such a gilt-edged affair after all. The public
really is not concerned with the return obtained on
their investment by foolish people who paid absurdly
high prices for shares in the expectation of future
gaudy bonuses. The real quality of the business
must be ascertained in another way. For a start,
take this bit of history:—-
1893 — Old co. in existence; capital, £40,000.
1894 — Still the old co. ; capital watered to £60,000.
1899 —New co. formed; capital watered to £120,000.
1902—20,000 shares issued at par.
1906 20,000 free shares issued.
1907 — 40,000 shares at par.
1909 Authorised capital increased from £200,000 to
£400,000."
1910 — 100,000 new shares issued ; 6s. per share paid
on them as a bonus ( £30,000 of water), and
4s. called up in cash.
1911— 10s. more called up on the last issue.
1912 100,000 shares issued at par; ss. (£25,000)
called up.
1913 (June) —Authorised capital further increased to
£BOO,OOO.
1913 (Dec.) —£116,666 of reserves capitalised and
ss. per share ( £25,000) called up on shares
issued in 1912.
From that you get these figures, from the formation
of the new co. in 1899 down to December 31 (before
the new lot of bonus shares are issued) : —Shares
issued to old co., £120,000; ditto issued for cash,
£155,000; ditto as bonuses, £50,000; total,
£325,000. Thus, since 1899, £155,000 has been
got in in cash. In June, 1900, the ship property was
valued at £37,324, landed property at £78,322 and
other property at £9057 net; total, £124,703. On
December 31, 1913, the ship property stood in the
books at £284,772, land £131,545, miscellaneous
£44,068; total £460,385. So the net assets have
been increased by £335,682, of which only £155,000
has come out of the shareholders’ pockets. In other
words, taking the vessels, etc., as worth only book
value, the public, besides providing the dividend
running from 10 to 15 p.c., has added more to the
funds of the co. than the shareholders have done
during tha past 14 years. And then, of course, the
question arises whether the book value represents the
real value. Anyhow, we can put it this way. The
co. during the past 14 years has added 25 vessels to
its fleet, including all the largest and most expensive,
and has added also £88,234 to its landed property
and liquid assets, and all the shareholders have contri-
buted to the lot has been £155,000. On the whole,
the thing can’t be regarded as exactly a failure.
What the co. is going to do in the future this paper
doesn’t know ; in fact, this paper isn’t sure of what
the co. is doing in the present. Expenses have unques-
tionably been bumped up by wages boards, etc., and
some at least of them won’t come down again. The
present bonus distribution is, moreover, the most
vigorous thing in that way done by this co. When
the £25,000 is in and the new shares are issued,
there will be £406,66G to pay dividend on ; and
10 p.c. on that would call for £23,333 per half-year.
Can the co. do that ? On past showing it can’t; but what
the directors have done, and what they have shown
they have done, may be quite different things. Still,
to bump up the visible profits from £ 16,000-odd to
£24,000 or so will take some nerve; and if it is
done, it looks as though a 10 p.c. div. would clean
up the profits so thoroughly that all thought of
further bonuses for some years to come must be
abandoned.

Strawberry has had a calf since 1905, and the calf
has grown up and “come in,” and the output of
North Coast butter has increased in consequence.
And with the cream cheque the NodJi Coast has
bought many things which this co. has also had the
job of carrying. Hence the increase of profits;
though when you consider the profits you must also
consider the increase of capital—it has been more
than doubled in eight years, and has been money
actually paid by the shareholders. The co. has its
own way of presenting its accounts. It has an in-
surance and repairs fund of £60,115, included among
the reserves in the foregoing table. This fund is,
presumably, fed from profits, and the net growth is
shown in the table as unexplained additions to re-
serves. Apparently other provision is also made for
wear and tear by the writing down of assets; but
how much is done in this way isn’t ascertainable. A
comparison of balance-sheet items doesn’t help much:

Sundry assets .. 4,776 33,888 35,183
The outstanding feature there is the large growth
of cash and liquid assets; they are now £92,649
net as against £17,081 in 1903. Meantime, how-
ever, £168,750 of new capital has been got in ; but
how much of that has been spent on new ships and
fixed property it is impossible to say. Nominally,
apart from the insurance and repairs fund, the co.’s
reserves haven’t been added to by more than about
£5OO a year during the past 10 years; but, as
hinted above, the insurance and repairs fund may be
true reserves, depreciation being otherwise provided
for ; and. if that is so, the surplus profits have aver-
aged about £3200 a year. And the record for the
past two years has been much better than that
average, notwithstanding that to the chronic
troubles over silted bars at the Northern river
entrances, there has of late been added a drought
which has made Strawberry a much less prolific old
horned vegetable than usual.

It is an erratic business, and the profits seem to
move according to no known laws. All that can be
said is that the co. has been running successfully for
37 years—that for 20 years past the dividend was
usually 8 p.c. during the first decade, and more
often has been 10 n.c. than anything else since
then. It ought to be easier to earn 10 p.c. now
than 8 p.c. 10 years ago, because in that time over
£20,000 has been added to the reserves, and £20,000
is more than one-third of the capital (£56,000).
Practically the whole of these savings is in liquid
assets; the additions, etc., to the fleet of tugs,
lighters, etc., have until lately been paid for out of
profits and written off to cover depreciation. In
fact, the cost of the additions, etc., hasn’t absorbed
all the amount written off. Reckoning as liquid
£lO,OOO paid on account of a steam barge which is
being’built for the B. 11. Prop.’s flux trade between
the iron quarries on one side of Spencer’s Gulf and
the smelters on the other, this is how things have
moved: —-

Assets apart from tugs and plant. . £18,319 £46,745
Liabilities . . . . . . . . 1,723 1,542
Surplus . . . . £45,203
That means an accumulation of £28,607 in seven
years by a co. with a capital of only £56,000. And
presumably the plant hasn’t meantime been allowed
to decay or go to rack and ruin. The Board of
Directors isn’t the sort to allow that kind of mis-
management.

Profits were no doubt affected by the strike of
slaughtermen which happened during the past year.
Nevertheless, after providing for depreciation and
expenditure on renewals and replacements, they were
more than double the amount required by the 10
p.c. div. In fact, during the past eight years (this
paper’s file goes back no farther) the dividend has
never once amounted to one-half of the profits. Cer-
tainly, large sums have been written off those pro-
fits; but, for example, the £20,000 which has dis-
appeared this year was money put to a special reserve
to pay for the new works at Oamaru. Six years
ago “land, buildings, machinery, plant, cottages,
etc., at Islington, Smithfield, Picton, Burnside,
Oamaru and Woodville, and shops and offices at
Christchurch” were in the books at £369,699. Now,
in spite of rebuilding and additions, the corresponding
assets stand in at only £271,091. Possibly they
have depreciated meantime; but the chances are they
are worth as much to-day as they were six years ago,
in which case the sums written off really • amount
to an internal reserve. And visible reserves have
in the same period increased by £75,5X3, while a
dividend, mostly of 10 p.c., has been paid. The
record is excellent. The meat-freezing and packing
business is erratic, and the profits irregular ; but in
the region of Christchurch they are both far less
wobbly than in the region, say, of Townsville, in
whose back country the occasional drought happens.
This co.’s capital is £173,186, which is exceedingly
modest considering that it last year handled 1,343,342
head of stock, and has five works in operation ; yet
its total liabilities are only £81,041, while its
assets, apart from land, premises and plant, amount
to £167,090 —a remarkably strong position, and only
possible through the management’s prudent policy of
paying a steady moderate dividend and keeping the
rest of the profits in the business. Even the possi-
bility of so prudently managed a co. being jeopardised
by the Yankee Meat Trust should be enough to stir
up a legislative rebellion.

When the first plank was laid down on that table
the capital was £74,520; now it is £106,244, with
£6OOO or so paid in premiums, and that increase
has to be kept in one eye while the other is running
down the column devoted to profits. Still, even in ’
proportion to the capital in the business, last half-
year’s profits show up remarkably well ; they were
at the rate of very nearly 12 o.c. p.a. on capital and
reserves combined. And that very fine result was
achieved without taking a risk with other people's
money to any extent worth mentioning; the total
liabilities of all kinds are only £12,508. There
are not many cos. that can show 12 p.c. under those
conditions. But this is one of the happy concerns
that don’t have to worry much about Wages Boards
and the high cost of livina - . In fact, the higher
the cost of living, the better, probably, it suits this
co.; for high cost of living means, among other
things, high rates for money, and, especially so long
as it works on.itsown money, the higher the rate
the better. It is, in fact, a poor wind that doesn’t
blow some profit to the Montv Peet, though, curiously
enough, the wind of prosperity seems to blow most
profit. Adversity sends to it people who must borrow ;
prosperity sends people who will borrow. And the
people who will borrow aren’t the people to drive a
hard bargain like those who must borrow. For this
and other reasons present profits are probably abnor-
mal ; and if the co. can maintain the present div. in
poor times, it will be mighty lucky—unless, of
course, the prosperous times last long enough for it
to accumulate considerable further reserves.

The £66,995 written off includes £25,000 trans-
ferred to the Contingency Fund —a reserve created
chiefly to protect the co. in case the price of any
metal drops hurriedly after the co. has drawn against
consignments, and before final settlements have been
made. _ If this fund, which now amounts to £65,000,
were included with the reserves shown above, their
total would reach £251,434. The actual profits
from mining and ore-treatment were not, on the
other hand, so good as the figures in that column
indicate, inasmuch as the figures were swollen by a
payment of £63,000 to the co. as compensation for
cancelling a contract for the sale of slimes made
with the Hydraulic Power and Smelting Co. —a re-
markable windfall which can’t be expected twice in
a lifetime. Knock off that £63.000, and the result
is that in the past year 211,593 tons of ore gave
£252,442 of profit, while 220,450 tons gave
£340,938 in the previous year—including profit
from stored by-products, custom smelting and other
sources in each case. Looked at in that way, the
past year wasn’t as glorious as 1911-12; and for
that the slump in the zinc market was chiefly re-
sponsible. So far as zinc is concerned, the co. is
paid for the deliveries from July 1 to June 30 on
the average prices ruling from Jan. 1 to December
31 following; and as the market toppled during the
latter half of last year, the value of the zinc output
for the 12 months under review was cut into badly.
This table shows how the erratic markets have be-
haved in recent years :—-

For the past three years the zinc average shown above
is the average for the 12 months to the end of De-
cember ; for the rest the averages are to the end of
June, when the co.’s books close.
The Sulphide Corporation has throughout been the
most enterprising of Broken Hill cos. It is a mostly-
English concern, with an English Board of rich men
who are in the habit of thinking in tens of thousands ;
and it- appointed a first-class general manager, gave
him very large powers, and didn’t harass him to
show instant results. The consequence has been a
very large, deliberate outlay on plant. Unfortunately
the co.’s expenditure' hasn’t always been fruitful. Its
huge initial outlay on the Ashcroft process was all
lost; and its plucky attempt to pioneer the produc-
tion of metallic zinc in Australia hasn’t been the
commercial success it should have been. But it
found compensations in the magnificent success of oil
and acid flotation for making a zinc concentrate
from the once-valueless tailings, and by using the
Minerals Separation process (which it introduced to
Australia) it must have netted at least £400,000 of
profit in the past three years. Now it is going fur-
ther, and by the latest improvement in flotation —
the “selective” process—it expects to make £50,000
extra profit this current year and after that any-
thing up to £lOO,OOO a year while the old slimes
dumps last (there are 229,000 tons of them). Nobody
can, of course, tell how the metal markets are going
to behave; but both lead and silver are firm, and.

as the Spelter Convention has been renewed, the zinc
snarket is likely to harden. The outlook for the
co. is, therefore, very cheerful. Besides, a super-
phosphate plant has been put up at Cockle Creek
(Newcastle) ; and, as this will use up material which
has hitherto been wasted, there should be money in
it. The plant (which can be doubled at small cost)
can turn out 15,000 tons or more of super, a year ;
this current year it will probably produce 8000 tons.
With the rapid growth of agriculture on modern
lines there is a big and promising market for this
product and for sulphate of ammonia, which is an-
other hitherto-wasted by-produqt. The co. spent
£71,564 on construction during the year, and nearly
all of it went into these super, and acid plants.
The dividend (the final instalment paid at the
end of December) was reduced from 30 to 20 p.c. ;
but the cash position was kept pretty level, notwith-
standing the very big outlay on new works. Take
this comparison as at June 30: —

In the first table it is shown that £66,995 was
written off during the year—£2s,ooo transferred to
contingencies and £41,995 written off plant. But,
in addition to the £41,995, a sum of £29,569 was,
in accordance with this co.’s excellent custom, charged
to working costs; so that, apart from the £25,000,
a total of £71,564 was written off. In other words,
the whole amount spent on new works during the
year was written off. After providing for the final
dividend there was a surplus of £207,278 as at
June 30, 1912. After providing the 20 p.c. div. for
the past year, and paying for all the new plant, there
is a surplus of £288,249 at the end of the past
year. Which means that the co. has (1) paid 20
p.c. on its capital of £962,500; (2) paid £71,564
for new plant, etc. ; and (3) added £80,971 to its
liauid assets. Meantime it has continued most valu-
able experimental work and spent large sums on plant
modifications and improvements. It seems a fair
thing to pull up here and give everybody three
cheers.
As mentioned above, the co. hauled 211,593 tons
of ore from its B. 11. Central mine; and at the end
of June there were 2,352,400 tons in reserve. At
that date the deepest stopes were at 1200 ft. Since
then, the 1300 ft. level has got through the lode,
which at this point is 62ft. wide; and 21ft. of it
averaged 17.40 z. silver, 14.4 p.c. lead, and 19 p.c.
zinc, whereas the average value of the stuff milled
last year was 11.60 z. silver, 14i3 p.c. lead and 16.7
p.c. zinc. From this it looks as if the co. won’t
have to worry about feed for its mills for the next
12 years certain. In this lowest level, by the way,
there is quite an appreciable quantity of gold—2ogr.
to the ton: close up ldwt., that is.

In June, 1912, the capital was £195,000 in
shares fully paid to £1 and 30,000 £1 shares paid
to 10s. Then the Gas Act came along, and it
became advisable to capitalise the reserves, and
make other changes. The present capital is, there-
fore, £396.490, made up as follows:

The £37,313 received in cash on “A” shares in-
cluded payments made on account of a new lot of
105,000 shares. The present total consists of the
210,000 shares mentioned as having been issued prior '
to June, 1912; 105,000 issued during 1912 ; and
63,000 subsequently issued as fully-paid bonus shares.
Total, 378,000 fully-paid “A” shares. Also 147,923
£1 “B” shares paid to 2s. 6d. The “A” shares are
entitled to 10 p.c. when the co. can pay it by charg-
ing 3s. 6d. ner 1000 for gas. The “B” shares stop
at 7 p.c. unless the co. can reduce the price of gas
below 3s. 6d. At present the co. is gathering evi-
dence in support of an application to raise the stan-
dard price from 3s. 6d. to 3s. 7d. in view of increased
wages awarded by Boards.. The Act provides for this
reconsideration of the standard. In these circum-
stances one wouldn’t expect the co. to strain itself to
issue a flourishing balance-sheet. Still there can be
no deliberate stuffing-away of profits nowadays with-
out a fracture of the law. The Act says that the
profits of a co. “shall not be utilised in any other
way than to provide for a special purposes fund, a
reserve fund and a divisible profits account.” The
“special purposes fund” may take 2 p.c. p.a. of the capi-
tal and may be used for contingencies or replacement
or removal of plant” ; and a reserve fund may only be
created when the profits exceed the standard rate of
dividend (10 p.c. on old or “A” capital). Profits
are apparently the surplus “after providing for all
the expenses properly chargeable to revenue”—and
scarcely will two accountants agree as to what they
are. However, even if an accountant can’t find ways
of putting either a poor or a good face on things
as his company desires, and even if the figures sub-
mitted by this co. for the half-year put the position
quite fairly and no worse than it really is, share-
holders have nothing to complain about; for, since
of the present capital (£396,490) only £250,803
was paid in cash, it follows that the 7 p.c. is really
a shade better than 11 p.c. on the money actually
put up—apart, of course, from the last £18,490
paid on the “B” shares. Incidentally it looks as
though as soon as money gets easier, or when the
standard price is reviewed, the co. will ask for some
more payments on account of that issue, the big
outlay on works having run up the co.’s liabilities
during the half-year from £12,433 net to £68,301
net —very nearly 10s. per share on the “B’Mssue,

Good ! No dividend again, which is just as it ought
to be in a case of this kind. Naturally a trustee
co., unless it buys somebody else’s business, can’t start
off with much of a business of its own. Brown and
Jones and Smitli may decide that, when they are
not alive enough to look after their affairs them-
selves; their families will be likely to be much
better served by a professional trustee co, than by
an amateur executor; but though they may conse-
quently form a trustee co., they won’t , even so much
as draw lots to decide which of the,'three shall die
so as to give the co. some revenue. A trustee co.
may therefore have remarkably good prospects even
if it isn’t making much profit; and this co. has
done very well to have cleared off all . its flotation
and preliminary exes, and made a start with a
reserve fund. Assuming that its capital (all except
£lOB5 invested in public securities) is earning 4J
p.c,, the co. seems now to be very nearly making
the business pay for itself; for, though the interest
would be £ 530 and the profit shown above was
only £291, another £lOO was made and voted to
the directors for their past services. In other words,
the past year’s revenue is charged with all directors’
fees up to date. Further, a few pounds went out
in squaring-up for the last of file preliminaries, in-
cluding the cost of the co.’s special Act. The capital
is £11,780; and with that backing and the influ-
ential Board which the co. has got together, the
co. ought to have a solid future, especially if it
keeps a watchful eye on the outgoings.

This co., by watering and otherwise, has brought its
capital up from £30,000 to £60,000, and has
launched out largely in the brick-making business.
Six months ago its surplus of assets apart from
mine, plant and brickworks was £19,690 ; now it is
£22,580. So, besides naying alO p.c. div. on the
enlarged capital, and putting a few hundreds into
the brickworks and other plant, it has saved ■up
£2890. How much precisely has gone into plant
can’t be told ; the book value is only a few hundreds
higher than it was on June 30, but probably a good
deal more than that has been spent and written off
against depreciation. And how much has been written
off the book-value of the mine and other wasting
assets can’t be told either, though it can be said in
a general way that hitherto the writing-down has
been pretty emphatic. As for coal-mines, the in-
vestor nearly always is in the dark as to the life
they will probably have. The brick business appar-
ently hasn’t got into its stride yet; anyway, only
£320 is credited to Profit and Loss on that account
for the past' six months. There ought to be a fair
market for these baked goods for some time to
come. Cohen, of Londdn, has evidently still a few
pounds to lend, and the Holman Government Will
hang on to him so long as he has a bean, and Will
thus keep the construction boom more or less alive.
Australian Phosphates, Ltd., the Sydney
co. formed to worki the bat-guano caves near
Rockhampton (Q.), is losing no time. The Northern
Coast line has just brought the deposits Within a
mile of rail, and a siding is already being put in.
This will reduce, the cost of haulage to Rockhampton
from £1 per ton to about half a crown. Drying and
desiccating plant, worked by a' suction-gas engine,
has been installed,: and aeriai trams (“flying foxes”)
have been rigged between the caves and the plant.
The cave series' has been only partly explored, but
already - the manager (R. F. Barker) estimates he
has from 100,000 to 130,000 tons available. It
must, however, be very difficult, if not impossible, to
make a close estimate. A laboratory has been well-
equipped ; this is important work, for the value of
the stuff lies in its nitrogen and phosphoric contents,
and the quality varies according to situation and
exposure. Further, to meet varying requirements, it
is proposed to produce 10 or a dozen varieties of
fertiliser. Typical analyses show from 3.8 p.c. ni-
trogen and 5.7 p.c. phosphoric acid up to 7.25 p.c.
nitrogen and 8.8 p.c. acid, the one sample worth,
according to the Queensland Agricultural Depart-
ment, £4 3s.' Bd. per ton, the other £7 # 3s. As
for a market, the co. looks chiefly to Queensland,
where there are so far no such artificial-manure
works as Mount Lyell, Wallaroo and the Sulph ; de
Corporation have established in the southern States;
and special attention will be given to the require-
ments of the 5000 or more sugar growers in the
North.

There is nothing much to report about
Ardlethan tinfield (N.S.W.) except the discovery of
13 more lodes. If there was a threepenny div. in
every lode that has been discovered at Ardlethan,
most of the shareholders would be millionaires by
this time. New lodes, however, do nothing for the
field nowadays; nothing but the talk of the mills
! is; listened to, and the mills continue to either speak
in whispers or to be fit subjects for the Deaf and
Dumb Asylum.
Bullrush (W.A.) had better get an inde-
pendent expert of standing to size up its prospects.
Managing-director Shallcross emphatically refuses to
endorse the action of the mine manager in marking
down the value of the reserves to 295. per ton, and
sticks like a limpet to the original estimate of 365.
per ton. He points out that three different sam-
plers on three different occasions arrived at the
same average, and that bulk crushings from the old
10-head mill, amounting to nearly 6000 tons, re-
• turned 365. 6d. per ton. Chairman Howard, in a
circular covering Shallcross’s report, names Harry
Neil as one of the three samplers who arrived at the
same result as Shallcross. Neil admits the impeach-
ment, but points out that his estimate only included
the ore in sight above and at the 170 ft. level. Since
then, another level has been driven and flesh stuff
opened up regarding the value of which Neil says
he knows nothing. A Mr. Cusworth has recom-
mended certain additions and improvements to the
plant and equipment which, if carried out, will,
according to Shallcross, reduce working costs to
6s. 6d. per ton. In The Bulletin's opinion, a lot
more money will be needed to enable the mine to be
properly handled; and the question is Whether it is
worth it. The opinion of an outside engineer is
wanted to throw light on this important point.
Associated Northern (W.A.) has decided
to take a business risk and instal a sulphide mill on
its Victorious mine at Ora Banda. For months past
a fair tonnage of sulphide ore has been carted about
20 miles to Broad Arrow, railed another 28 miles to
Golden Gate siding, and carted a further half-
mile to the co.’s mill on the Iron Duke lease.
This costly way of doing things is to cease pending
the erection of a plant on the mine. An amiable
old body named Professor Liveing, who visits the
co.’s properties every few years in the capacity of
consulting engineer, recently spent a couple of
months on the fields, and is now conferring with the
Board in London.
* * * *
Lancefield (W.A.) is to be re-worked
right away. The new owners propose to put a little
ore through the mill to start with, and gradually
increase the quantity to 6000 tons a month. Work-
ing on this basis, it is expected that a higher grade
will be maintainable than Was possible When the
old co. Was putting through 8000 tons, and the
reorganisation of the plant will, it is hoped, result
in higher extraction and lower costs. Plenty of ore
worth 30s. and upwards is alleged to be in the
mine; but refractory constituents and other draw-
backs have hitherto prevented the profitable recovery
of the gold contents, For a time monthly surpluses
were made, but When all charges Were reckoned up
there was no real profit in the work* and a feW
bad months knocked the old co. Off its financial
perch. Preterit oWners may make a db of things
for a time* but the outlook is still doubtful.
* * * *
Mountain Queen (W.A.) is gradually
getting to the end of its tether. The bulk of the
ore now going through the mill is coming from the
surface, where the payable alluvial dirt spreads
over a big width. Most of the oxidised reserves
underground have been worked out; and as the
mine is a failure in the sulphide zone, it will soon
be time for shareholders to look out. The co. is
hopeful of ultimately getting the Great Victoria at a
reasonable figure, and if it succeeds the plant will
be shifted and a fresh start made at a new mine.
Black Range West (W.A.) announces
another return from its much-advertised shoot at
'the No. 5 level. On this occasion 307 tons were
treated for 4450 z. bullion. The crushing came from
a drive which is reputed to have a length so far of
80ft., and to be on a reef which has a width in
places of Bft.
* * * *
Ida H. (W.A.) is in the hands of a plaus-
ible lot. At the annual meeting in London share-
holders’ hopes were buoyed up with tales of what
the mine had done in the past, and what it was
likely to do in the future, and a 3d. div. was de-
clared just to show that the co. was well- off. The
usual remark about recent developments giving the
mine a considerable lease of life was made, and
reserves were roughly estimated at 10,000 tons—
equivalent to about nine months’ mill supplies. The
fact is the Ida H is in a very lean condition, and
although the aforesaid 10,000 tons and a lot ,more
besides may be taken out of the property, it is
unlikely that there Will be much profit earned In
the future, owing to increasing costs.
* * * *
Central and West Boulder had its pros-
pects well boomed at the meeting in London last
month. Reference Was made to a lode from Which
the co. once made £9O a week, and the value of
several other formations Was also fluted about. Then
followed the usual guff that if so and so happened
the co. could reasonably expect to make money. The
fact is the Central and West Boulder leases are Only
suitable for fossicking tributors, and will never be
much use to any co, As for divs., shareholders may
just as well make up their minds right away that
they will never get any worth building on.
* * * *
Victoria’s coal enterprise for 1913 was
provided by one big State fellow and three
hangers-on. In 1909 Wonthaggi began with a yield
of 2946 tons out of a total for the State of 128,173
tons. Last year 593,912 tons were raised in Vic-
toria, of which the State mine supplied 455,695 tons.
Private Enterprise did thus poorly: Jumbunna, 53,305
tons; Austral, 31,506 tons; and Outtrim, 24,326
tons. If there had been more horse-sense among the
Wonthaggi workers the State pits would have fur-
nished a much bigger yield. If, also, the fat Leg.
Councillors had let Peter Mcßride have his way,
the little private mines would have had to compete in
the marketplace, as in Maoriland, with the State coal.
The cost of living would have thereby been reduced ;
but the big man won’t have that when a practical
proposal is made. Wonthaggi will supply coal to the
railways for electricity, so its figures will go still
higher. The next battle to be fought will be over
the question whether the Department should be per-
mitted to supply cheap power to the man who may
want it. Once more the Fat Man, who raves against
the high cost of living, will be sure to say “No” in
his loudest voice.
After all, Great Southern (Vic.) has given
in before the Chiltern Valley and the Great Southern
Consols. When these two have finished, Rutherglen
will be given over to the cockies and the phylloxera
beetle. Great Southern’s output totals about
136,0000 z. ; it took nearly £lOO,OOO of capital to
win it, and only half that amount came back in
divs. There is still gold in the gutter, but the
width of the wash, the cost of pumping, and the
heavy ground leave no margin directly the average
per fathom comes down to lOdwt. or 12dwt. Besides,
the old faith in deep-lead mining does not now live
in Melbourne board rooms, especially since costs
jumped so. The co.’s liquidation div. is expected to
be 4s. or ss. per share. No one hears a word about
a crumb for the 200 miners who now have to make
a fresh start in life.
Stage fright crumbled the market in Mel-
bourne last week over Great Southern Consols,
Rutherglen. A 13s. drop leaves the price where it
should have stood before Sydney and other fools
tried to corner the shares to get a “bear squeeze”
on. The lesson is old but lasting. To buy is easy;
to sell the very devil! That, in short, is the history
of this last little flutter.
Prospecting for a continuation of Mount
Morgan’s famous ore body has been poorly rewarded.
Tom Mills, of Charters Towers, has been pluckily
backing up the search in the Extension lease. His co.
has been exploring deep levels, and has proved at
1014 ft. a very wide formation carrying low values
bounded by a* granite wall. A month ago improved
values were reported, but as nothing more has been
heard about the samples sent for assay, the worst
may be expected. Even in the big mine, values at
the 950 ft. level are capricious; the big body is a
huge nut of low-grade ore with a kernel of richer
material, and there is no satisfactory proof that the
kernel lives below 950 ft.
* * * *
The hopeful people who tried to resurrect
the O.K. copper mine, in North Queensland, have
got so little encouragement that a sale of plant is
advertised. The truth is that in the old days of the
mine the management did far more prospecting than
it ever mentioned, the silence being due to the nega-
tive results obtained. The recent efforts were there-
fore merely the whipping Of a horse that someone
else had proved to be dead.
* * *
Mount Perry (Q.), owned by an English
co., which has put in some capital work in its time,
is down and out. The Government gave it some help ;
but that was no use, and at last the co. had to oWn
up that the till was empty—and the last fortnight s
wages were still unpaid. However, manager Pul-
brook says there are enough assets to satisfy local
demands. The miners are nearly all being taken on
by Mount Morgan, which has been lamenting its lack
of men.
Clark’s Brilliant, Charters Towers, will
reconstruct in order to raise capital to open up
its Moonstone and Treasure mine, which at the
moment is showing prospects at the 426 ft. level.
Shares have lately been mopped up at low prices >as
a gamble.
Chillagoe (Q.) can’t make money out of its
smelting business, so it will probably close down to
give some of its mines—particularly Kinasleigh—
time to recuperate, while Mount Mulligan is brought
forward as a source of coke supply.

South Australian Oil Wells Co. looks like
getting to work in March with bores between
Tantanoola and Millicent and between Millicent and
the Hanging Rock, all on the seaward aspect
of the Woakwine Range. Petroleum and paraffin have
been found nearer the sea, and most of the share
applications are coming out of the district which
the discovery will most benefit. Surface evidence
Of oil Is present-tertiary marine beds, limestones,
sandstones, muostones and salt springs and brine
deposits, There is no better probable petroliferous coun-
try in Australia than the field now to be tested.

NURSE URE SAYS YOU CAN’T BEAT IT.
In a recent letter from the Lake View Hotel,
Ballarat, Vic., Nurse Ure writes: “You can’t beat
Chamberlain’s Cough Remedy for children. It is
absolutely the best I have used in my professional
career, extending over 20 years. Numerous cases of
croup, which is a most dreadful complaint for chil-
dren, have come under my notice, and I never hesi-
tate to recommend Chamberlain’s Cough Remedy, for
it means absolutely the end of the disease after
three or four doses.”*

Sydney, February 2, 1914.
My Dear Arini, —
Dr, A, J. Turner, a mild-mannered, spec-
tacled beetle-hunter from Brisbane, spent
two-thirds of his stay at Kosciusko on the
skyline, leaping from boulder to bouldet
with a butterfly net. Wheh he was fired with
the fierce excitement of the chase, his small
thin figure—like a wooden match propped
actively against the sky-line—seemed to be
hopping into Eternity 6000 feet below.
(Even if you have led a good life yoU go
down into Eternity from Kosciusko.) But
he always panted home without any brokeh
bones, to show the lions he had captured to
the admiring gaze of Mrs. Turner. The lady
is educated up to the right note of exclama-
tion when a moth the sifce of a threepenny
bit is the result of the hair-breadth leaps
over chasms at the bottom of which Death
is waiting to make a snack off the leaper s
bones.
Manager LovegroVe, of the Cooma branch
of the Commercial Bank, motored up to the
big Monaro hilltop for the carnival, and
brought two daughters with him. One girl
was good-looking enough to be shadowed by
a camera-man, and he snapped her often.
She had to jump logs and climb stiles
with circumspection and as small a display of
stocking as possible, for the pictures are liable
to aopear in this week’s papers, as evidence
of what Australia can do in the way of
beauty when it gets its coat off and really
sets to work.
The Jap ball at the Kosciusko Hostel last
Week was moderately thrilled by the appear-
ance of young damsels more or less dis-
guised as paper flowers. An Ashfield girl,
Miss .Grant, who is described by a male
acquaintance just back from the dear
old hillock as “bright and intelligent,”
snatched first prize as a hibiscus, with her
head top-dressed in the scarlet petals. Jessie
Clark, of Brisbane, ran the winner very close
with a saucy paper frock, “The Wearin* o'
the Green.”
The fashionable floppy girl is an inconsid-
erable minority on the big, rugged, untamed
mountain, while the sporting crowd is bust-
ling around. One or two young posers, with
hair gummed over their ears, small, bleating
voices like baby lambs, and round-eyed, star-
ing expressions, flopped a bit, but the scenery
Was too rugged, and, as regards most of them,
their size in flops gradually diminished till
there was no floppiness remaining. Still, one
brown-eyed girl kept the game going
steadily, in the latest N’York style. But
the male breast remained calm, and the
male person affected the company of that
brisk little sport, May Pattinson, of Abbots-
ford. This lively damsel won the prize for rifle
shooting in the ladies’ competition. The hostel
authorities have thoughtfully arranged the
miniature range about 200 yards from the
door, and yon can bang away for a week and
never hit anything except a thick-waisted
hill in the background. The members of the
Kosciusko staff don’t take any risks when
they trust women with firearms.
Grace Watson writes from the Lyceum
Club, London, re a recent dinner given there
to Olive Schreiner. The Africander, who
leapt into fame as the creator of “The Story
of an African Farm,” is described as a small,
weary-looking woman carrying a load of ill-
health. . She hadn’t been in England for 16
years till the present visit, possibly because
she took the British-Boer squabble to heart,
being all-Dutch in sentiment. Olive refused
to accept any other welcome in London —not
that London is likely to excite itself over
a writer whose genius burnt out in one book.
Jerome K. Jerome got on his feet, and was
so witty that Grace says she is almost per-
suaded to read all his books in consequence.
W. L. George, mentioned as a young writer
who showed his inexperience by inflicting 25
minutes’ oration on the yawning company,
proposed “The Women of the Twentieth
Century.” Sarah Grand, who used to be
considered rather beyond the Young Person,
till Elinor Glyn and Victoria Cross made
blushes go out of print, wak asked to re-
spond to this toast. As she hadn’t been
asked on paper beforehand, she declined.
Cunningham Graham took her place. He
implored Olive Schreiner not to send them
away without a word. She replied in one
sentence, “I never have any doubt about the
20th century when I see growing up the
beautiful young girls and the equally beauti-
ful (?) young men.”
The Seaside Camps’ committee had another
meeting the other day. In spite of the
financial lion in the path (the heavy initial
expenses which Warringah Shire Council
hurls in front of the Camp, in the shape of
drastic conditions), the committee hoists its
feathers and tosses its best hat aloft and
stamps forward. The Collaroy Surf Club,
a briny association of life savers, has nobly
offered to look after the Dee Why campers
from the sun-baked plains, when they swal-
low their first breakers. This won’t be till
next summer, for the first cwt. of nails in
the bungalows-to-be is still to be bought.
A Dolls’ Carnival in aid of the Royal
Alexandra Hospital for Children, will fill the
Town Hall with sawdust, etc., early in Octo-
ber. During the third week in February, a
big meeting will whip the scheme into shape.
There is a small gathering on the same sub-
ject before this reaches you.
A Manly correspondent writes: “I read
With interest, your remarks about the surf
shooter (oh January 22).,. .There is likely
to be trouble if anyone is caught ‘nicking’
my surf-board for ironing purposes, as it is
genuine Honolulu surf timber, and not a do-
mestic implement.”
Lord Chelmsford is probqjbly the best tip
for the Governor-General’s billet yet men-
tioned by the loquacious cables, because he
is supposed to want it with enthusiasm.
The Tennysons put Up a fairly shabby record
Oh the £lO,OOO a year. It isn’t considered
too good U living wage for a poor man ( for
he has to feed those who are hot hungry, and
keep on doing it all the year round. Also,
he must keep up an extravagant staff of ser-
vants, and fulfil other necessities of Gover-
nor-Generailing. Hopetoun, with exceptional
outlay during the 1901 Commonwealth fire*
works, dropped about £40.000 out of his own
purse. The wealthy Northcotes couldn’t
have had much change left for the collection
plate out of £20,000 a year. The Denman
expenditure is probably more. Baron Chelms-
ford is a poor man with a rich wife of un-
commonly thrifty ways, but they can hand
out bushels of Good Advice as of yore.
Lewis Harcourt, Secretary of State for
the Colonies, is a more doubtful tip for the
Denmans’ palace by the Yarra. He is a rela-
tive of Chamberlain Dick Nevill, and is said
to show an unusually intelligent interest (for
Downing-street) in Australian affairs. Mrs.
Harcourt is a wealthy American, a noted
London hostess, and much given to holding
out lavish refreshment to visitors from the
Commonwealth. But Chelmsford seems to
be leading by a nose in the first heat.
Mr. W. B. Scandrett, who has made a
habit of being Mayor of Invercargill (M.L.),
is passing through this waterside paradise
for the Dominion. He is just back from* a
10 months’ scamper on the other side, so I
suppose he has been unanimously elected ex-
Mayor by way of a change. The Maorilander
is a land and estate agent, and an old iden-
tity in the gusty town which David Christie
Murray wrongly credited with the most
southerly street lamp in the world. And he
said there was an intoxicated Scot leaning
against it.
An energetic German named E. Ranft, who
climbs mountains for his own amusement, is
going to dig his feet into the sides of Mount
Cook (M.L.) this month. He leaves Syd-
ney with this intent, forthwith. Mount
Cook is a hostile and perpendicular animal,
and few people fall from the top of it twice.
Mr. and Mrs. Raine —he is the Raine who
is followed by Horne in the auctioneering
business —are off to M.L. for a tour that
will gallop over most of that little Domi-
nion’s hot and cold map. They are
going to begin at Auckland, see Rotorua and
bump down the Wanganui Rapids. Thence
to the South Island and back by The Bluff —
where the Stewart Island oyster lurks with
a beard like a Druid’s gala, whiskers —and
Melbourne.
Dr. Wally Macdonald died recently in
Sydney, at the age of 54—mostly of over-
work. Years ago he was one of the best-
known medicos in Queensland, where he
posted through way-back settlements with
relays of swift ponies that fled across the
surface of the silences like dusty spectres on
seven-leagued hoofs. Dr. Macdonald suf-
fered from a complaint which is almost fatal
when it attacks his profession—philan-
thropy. Fees came last —mostly they never
came at all —because the soft-hearted Scot
didn’t bother about them if the patients
were short of cash, or pretended to be. It
is astonishing what a number of short-of-
cash invalids found out this weak spot
under the Macdonald waistcoat, and chased
the doctor at any hour In the day or night
for immediate attention. They said he was
the best of good fellows, and some of them
bought cows or pianolas with the money they
owed him. Others simply said he was a
bloated millionaire who didn’t need money.
He was so worn out with the illnesses of
other people that he finally indulged in a
long sickness of his own. The light flickered
out a week or two ago, to the great loss of
friends, relatives and patients—paying and
non-paying.
Sydney’s ex-Mayoress, Mrs. A. A. Cocks,
handed W. G. Layton, deputy Town Clerk,
and perpetual A.D.C. to municipal majesty,
a heavv and useless token of her esteem the
other day. It is a solid silver salver, with
an inscription which the recipient supple-
ments by saying he “didn’t deserve it.”
That’s how everyone tries to feel under
these circumstances.
Squatter. Mack and two daughters, of
Pallal station, up Barraba way (N.S.W.),
have gone to Manila, in the Philippines—
not Manilla in this State —for the Carnival,
and may drop in at Hongkong before coming
home. A Manila carnival is interesting in
its way. There is chook-fighting, of course,
but bull-fighting is discouraged by the Uncle
Sam authorities. There isn’t much drink-
ing, and there is no more smoking than
usual, for the Filipino couldn’t smoke more
than usual without taking fire and being
burned to the ground. There are illumina-
tions and color schemes and much harmless
decoration, but there is very little solid
turkey or plum-pudding or other indigestibles
behind it all. When the white man means
to rejoice he purchases great masses of boiled
or fried stodge and a tank of drinkables, and
he lays in racehorses and heated footballs,
and, with these things and a heap of tram-
cars and trains and much suffocation, he
labors at his mirth till he falls down ex-
hausted. The brown child of nature simply
says. “I will be gay,” and he puts a red
flower behind his ear and rejoices exceed-
ingly. Sometimes he even goes as far as to
eat a cocoanut.
The Jack Friths, whose big sheepwalk is
out near Charleville (Q.), though their hos-
pitable door on the hills above Toowoomba is
always on the latch, go to England in the
Otway on February 11. They’ll be away
about 12 months, and mean to impress an
English grandma with the healthy tan of
sturdy Australian grandsons as prime sam-
ples of the Queensland Boy.
You may remember a mention of the rich
widow Macarthy, of Wellington (M.L.),
who was here on a visit some time ago. Her
late husband, T. G. Macarthy, left about
£400,000 to Maoriland charities, and pin-
money to the extent of £200,000 or £300,000
(the exact sum didn’t leak out here) to his
handsome widow. The lady has married
again. The wedding occurred with much
pomp in the same old Wellington the other
week. Premier Massey gave the richly-gilt
bride away to Mr. Walter Reid, of that
town. The Macarthy fortune will probably
stay in Maoriland, for the newly-wed Reids,
after a jaunt to Europe, are likely to settle
in the Dominion.
Dr. Bowie, the Scotchbyterian medical mis-
sionary who was volcanoed out of Ambryn in
the New Hebrides, is the man who was offered
the management of the Tropical School of
Medicine, or something of the kind, in Lon-
don a while ago. He declined the billet, as
he prefers healing Brown Brother’s body and
catechising his soul, in the Islands. The
natives describe him as “an angel of a doc-
tor, and a devil (no ‘nonsense fellow’) of a
missionary.” Bowie’s value as a medicine
man, according to a Sydney woman who saw
the Ambryn hospital <now ashes), is acknow-
ledged by French settlers in the Hebrides.
Otherwise there’s war about Brown Brother
to the last inch of his heathen skin between
the two parties.
Mrs. Charlie Badgery and her daughters
have taken a furnished cot at Coogee till
April.
Mrs. Martin Donohoe will wend her way
back to Martin and Paris early in March,
via Melbourne, doing a brief sojourn in the
southern city as she goes, just to show that
she bears it no animosity.
A United States doctor has pranced into
the mixed bathing question with the acri-
mony one doesn’t expect from that usually
easy-going profession. He considers mixed
bathing the death-blow to matrimony for the
following reasons: “I don’t believe,” he
snorts, “that one young man out of 50 wants
to marry the girl he has bathed with. .. .Do
bare arms, bare necks, bare legs and ugly
skull caps furnish a bewitching spectacle?
What effect has the ungraceful flopping of
the female porpoise on the male intellect?”
Well, how does it come to pass that marriage
survives in brown Polynesian communities,
where people swim much and dress little:
that it existed among our own ancestors be-
fore they took to clothes so that the race
didn’t die out; and that the largely unclothed
stage siren often marries into the peerage?
It may be a bird-faced section of the peer-
age, with a retreating brow and a retreating
chin, but still the footlight lady of scanty
garniture often marries it.
The aeroplane skirt, which is said to be
finding favor in the U.S., makes the lady
who wears it look exactly like a kite —the
kind of kite any active boy could fly on a.
windy day if it didn’t kick too much.
The news that the silver bell presented (in
effigy) to H.M.A.S. Sydney actually exists
and can be run to earth in a local jeweller’s
shop window, caused an unexpected flutter
here last week. Says one doubting Thomas :
“lake many others, I thought the bell a myth
that had gone to pieces, or a second Mrs.
’Arris of Gamp invention, till the other day.
Next time we give away silver plate or other
matter, we ought to have the stuff in hand
before making such a noise about it.”
H. N. Southwell’s testimonial from his Syd-
ney friends —a cheque for £5O0 —was handed
over to the still sick man the other afternoon,
at the Australia. Mayor Richards, an old
friend of the invalid, was in charge of the
meeting. John Lemmone, hon. organiser of
the movement which put into cash its recog-
nition of “Southie’s” many services to the
mendicant Mrs. Charity, made a few remarks,
and J. D. Fitzgerald added a strong post-
script.
There’s nothing new under the moon.
Shakspeare got away with nearly all the
plots worth having. Humbler scribes have
been scribbling in a circle ever since, though
there was a big. break-away on the part of
Dickens, who was hardly a humbler scribe,
and some new notions on High Society—
some of it is high enough to be pretty rotten
—by Thackeray. Pinero, like other modern
playwrights, can only drape some of the old
fiction frames with new dialogue. “His
House in Order” may not owe anything to
Thackeray’s “Lovel the Widower,” but there
is a reminiscent air about Annabel, the dear
departed nuisance, in the play at the Little
Theatre, and she greatly reminds of Lovel’s
sainted Cecilia —also departed. Only Lovel
hadn’t married the pretty governess when
sainted Cecilia’s harp in the corner used to
go off suddenly like a demented cracker,
what time her mother and the widower’s
mamma fought over the youngsters.
Violet Paget as Nina wears some frocks
in “His House in Order” that the average
woman would like to steal. The flame pink
gown with a fleck of black, in which she
declines to go to sainted Annabel’s
memorial park presentation, is a yell of
defiance at the dreary family of her pre-
decessor. A pale gold frock with a scarlet
rose blushing furiously at the waist is
another challenge to the half-mourning ex-
pression of her new husband’s old mother-
in-law. One stage child is a good deal like
another, but little Kathleen Lindgren’s
treble pipe is less staccato than the usual
shrill squeak of the performing babe. She
is an attractive little boy, and her tears at
having her hair cropped for the part are
now dry. Pinero builds the reporter in the
piece on old-fashioned English lines, and he
asks for an interview with a politician as
humbly as if he asked for the loan of £5.
His House in Disorder under the reign of
Mrs. Nina, is so good that it is worth
climbing over its long speeches to have a
look at the Paget frocks, which are several
thousand a year ahead of the furniture.
“The Hall at the Towers” is a depressing
understudy to any railway waiting-room,
plus some attenuated antlers that are only
a little more imposing than curly sets of
bonnet pins stuck to the baronial walls.
Secretary Ross Gore, of Rose Bay Goff
Links, won the men’s foursomes at the Kos-
ciusko carnival, with Solicitor Frank
McDonald as his partner. Mr. Gore carried
off a few more trophies besides. This is not
startling in a goffer who can play the game
most of the day with intervals for meals,
while mere toilers eat up time and space in
the race to catch the early morning ferry-
boat.
Haughty revue show girls stamped round
the premises of a well-known drapery firm
the other morning in their new stage frocks.
This private parade was by no means to
their liking. “Subjected to this” was bitten
off between their clenched teeth, as the hum-
ble press dug its pencils into descriptive
clothes matter. Looking at these tall
chorus duchesses in cold blood, by the un-
blinking light of the morning sun, one recog-
nised the more beefy and top-lofty appear-
ance of the English importations. They’re
expected to marry dukelings. The old origi-
nal duchess (the lady whose family tree
is moth-eaten wfith age and mortgages')
must squirm with rage when Young Hopeful
brings home a show highness who would
patronise a litter of royalties, and dig her
elbows into the ribs of an archbishop if he
made the grass too long.
The best-looking girl of the Revue lot —
and the lot was good to look at —was a
Melbourne damsel in purple drapery. A
fair-haired haughtiness had wept over her
new gown —a wonderful creation in yellow
and black —because she fancied a sulphur-
colored crest of feather, like a white cocka-
too’s top-knot—would spoil her appearance.
But there was no need for tears. A Tanger-
ine lady bobbed about under a crest of pom-
poms, and a dazzling display of silk stock-
ing was the main feature of the gauzy
drapes. Some of the head-dresses out-
Josephined Josephine, and were rather
smaller than firemen’s helmets, with beaded
chin-straps. One lady tossed about 2ft. of
black cocque feathers on top of her head, so
the tulle halo must be on the wane. Every
lady’s feet were too large for her new shoes,
so shoes were shed like leaves in autumn.
Fur was cunningly used, even on the feet of
one show duchess, and it looked fairly warm
on a summer morning.
Percy Jones, the youthful Victorian band-
master who was adjudicating here a week
or so ago, is the Geelong musician who was
sent to Europe (by his townsmen) to touch
up his technique. He returned about two
years back with a profound admiration for
the high value which many of the veteran
music-masters place on their time. “Three
guineas a lesson, for instance, is now the
fee in Vienna and one or two other Con-
tinental cities.” said bandmaster Jones.
“You can’t get three guineas’ value out of
one lesson —at least that was my experience
—but of course you get it incidentally later
on by saying you’re a pupil of So-and-So.”
Yours affectionately,
VANDORIAN.

MELBOURNE CHATTER.
Melbourne, February 2, 1914.
My Dear Yarrie, —
G.-G. Denman has a fearfully busy time
ahead of him before his “notice” is up.
There are so many bazaars to open that the
end of his term will be rather like a draper’s
clearing sale. The first function on the vice-
regal programme is the A.N.A. outburst,
which is to occur in the roomy Exhibition.
11 will begin with a crash and many echo-
ing howls, on February 14.
The Idle Classes (they have to be called
that to distinguish them from the Working
Classes), having nothing much else to occupy
their minds, and being constitutionally blith-
ersome, are quivering with anxiety about the
shuffle in Governor-Generals. They don’t
perspire so much over the potentate himself
—it is the dame who really causes them
heartburning, cold feet and that empty feel-
ing after banquets they haven’t been invited
to. Of the little group who have been men-
tioned as possible successors to Denman,
Harcourt lias a wife who is an heiress, a
smart dresser and a renowned hostess ; while
another likely candidate’s wife (the Munro-
Ferguson lady) merely does needlework, blow
it! She really is the Lady Hermione, and
the daughter of a lord; but such facts won’t
comfort the local free-fooders if she only
comes here to stitch, stitch, stitch amidst
riches, over-eating and elegance. These
things are better left to females in reduced
circumstances. Of course, the interminable
Arts and Crafts would be delighted to have
a sort of endless sewing bee raging at Gov-
ernment House. But the people who really
should be studied are the ones who like to
enjoy life—at other people’s expense.
Professor Peterson’s son, who was put
carefully into the right sausage machine to be
turned into a lawyer, has deserted the Uni-
versity and is chasing along the Inky Way.
The rash act —though it might have been
rasher —has grieved his musical father con-
siderably. The young man has been free-
lancing for quite a while, and now
sees a real job ready to his hand. Latterly
he has been employing his holidays in helping
with panto libretto at Her Majesty’s.
m Coppell, the man who is said to have won
£30,000, or thereabout, in Cup “double”
wagers, has been splashing it a bit at Illing-
worth, his Toorak place. He gave a bridge
party and supper to about 300 guests, the
supper being a midnight champagne revel,
with Tango accompaniment. It happened in
a marquee draped with silver tissue and lit
with rose chiffon electric lights. A flight of
stuffed tropical birds winged their immovable
way over the eaters, and tropical paper
flowers encumbered the air space. All hands
were waited on by a choice selection of Win-
ter Garden girls.
Lost explorer Scott’s widow seems to be
flying from her sorrowful recollections. She
is one of the most frequent passengers in the
big flights at Hendon (England).
Rose Musgi-ove, whose husband is a Ceylon
tea planter, is home again and taking a cool
seaside summering at Sorrento. She had a
struggle to get her Indian ayah into the coun-
try, but it was managed, so there need be no
Petriana myth about it.
Leonie Peterson-Mackworth, who carried
off the matrimonial catch of last season, is
at Sorrento with her husband. They spend
most of the time yachting. The tall Captain
fools about with the ropes and sails, while
Leonie, garbed in the cutest of trousseau
clothes, lolls in Harrison Fisher attitudes and
makes pictures.
Mrs. Nelly is getting ready for forays and
onsets in connection with the opening of the
ci-eche at Fitzroy, which is her husband’s dis-
trict. Dr. Nelly has a strong theory that, if
you look after the babies, the grown-ups will
look after themselves —that is if they happen
to be the babies you looked after. All the
same, he doubtless does not approve of them
taking too much care of themselves. They
ought to want the doctor occasionally, if only
fox the sake of politeness.
Father Robinson, that ardent advertising
crusader, has heaped up the stones neces-
sary for his church, and is now out after all
the old jewellery his flock has stored away.
He is bent on gathering the unconsidered
relics —“old brass and bits o’ glass and
ha’pennies that will not pass,” as poet Whit-
ney put it —and melting them down to make
service vessels for the altar. If there are
jewels among the metal, so much the better —
they will help to decorate the sacred imple-
ments. Rings of broken engagements will
probably find their way to him, and Mary and
Jane (good, religious girls both of them) will
have the tragic satisfaction of knowing that
the church chalices are studded with the dia-
monds that denote broken hearts.
The Otway, on its way round to Sydney,
dumped Viscount Kelburn and his wife for
two days in Melbourne. The illustrious pair
•and their eminent youngsters got lodgings
with the Denmans during the ship’s stay, and
then resumed their journey to Sydney.
Thence they go to Maoriland, where he is to
do some gentlemanly sailoring as boss of the
Pyramus.
The great Syme clan has acquired a new
recruit, the contributing member being the
prettv little wife of farmer Oswald Syme.
(You will remember, dear, that she used to
be Lucy Rowe.) The baby is the finest in-
fant that ever transpired.
The Denman dame vod-mothered the
Brookes baby, and the consequent fuss in St.
Paul’s Cathedral must have been repeated in
Heaven, if social distinction counts at all in
that remote place. Frocky gran’ma Emmer-
ton swept over the mosaic pavement in fash-
ionable clingsome clothes, wearing the beatific
smile proper to such a tremendous occasion.
Baby was attired in its mother’s wedding veil
and other superfluous flummery, and bore up
very well, considering. Mother, looking very
pale and fiuttery in white, was attended by
husband Norman, who looked as if he would
rather have been out on the courts. The
Denman godmother’s own name —Elaine—
was duly bestowed on the infant, after which
all the absurd grown-ups adjourned to the
Emmerton house for champagne and a little
more fuss.
John Thompson, M.H.R., the almost-mute
member for some place of which I have for-
gotten the name, was securely married at
►Scots’ Church to widow Langlands Jack. The
small lady, who was clad in white silk, looked
fascinating in the subdued kirldight, and the
bridegroom—a mere lad of 60 or so—was sup-
ported by his elder brother. The wedding
was really and truly “quiet,” the little widow
and the bachelor having collected the con-
gratulations of their friends in advance at
separate sprees. The pair departed for a
Sydney honeymoon.
Oswald Watt is wandering about the Riv-
erina looking in at the Faulkiners’ and other
sheep-runs. I understand the uncoupled
Mrs. Oswald—Judge Williams’s merry
daughter—is enjoying herself in Europe.
The Willie Sharps, who own many timber
stacks, are off for a travelling rest, now that
the marrying of Marjorie is an accomplished
fact. Marjorie’s trousseau was a sort of
Webster’s International Dictionary in duds,
and the house linen accumulated by her de-
voted mother will keep Marjorie engaging
washerladies for years. The lucky owner is
now Mrs. Captain Currie, and is off to Eng-
land for a long honeymoon.
Medico John Williams struggled off the
sick list just in order that he might greet
daughter Amy cheerfully, when she arrived
from her ’Frisco home with husband Harry
Nicholas. The visitor longs to be back in
Australia. Still America has given her a
dash of smartness which shows off her bru-
nette beautv nicely.
A selection of the local peerage attended
at Spencer-street on Thursday to say good-
bye to Captain Jim Lilley and his wife, who
were packed and labelled for London, via
Adelaide. Lilley acquired a permanent limp
and the D.S.O. during the South African
foolishness. Having come out on honey-
moon leave with a bride related to a title,
the pair were overwhelmed with offers of
free board and lodging. After a glance at
Tasmania and a final flutter or flap- at Mrs.
Robert Harper’s Macedon place, they de-
parted as aforesaid, and so ended the thril-
ling chapter.
On February 17, at 11.30 a.m., Phyllis,
the Brighton Fred Wards’ daughter, and
squatter Norman Wilson will be ejected
from the Ward mansion with joy, rice, old
boots and confetti. The best English wed-
dings are small and early nowadays, so the
coming event will be in happy contrast to
the usual crush function where one sees
lunchless hordes fighting for a mere jam tart
and a small glass of wine. Bridegroom-elect
Norman earned his crust as manager of Sam
Wilson’s Ercildoune sheep-run before his
father bestowed on him the N.S.W. property
of Big Springs.
The Willie McCullochs are housed at
Sandringham while a shanty is being trow-
elled together for them on the family
estate, just a few miles from the old home-
stead, where Sam and his American wife
are housekeeping.
Rolf Boldrewood Browne is just begin-
ning to bushrange his suburban garden again
after his severe bout of illness. South Yarra
neighbors have missed the veteran novelist
for a long while.
Aviator Hawker will fly at Caulfield on
Saturday. He promises that there will be
no delays or disappointments, and remarks
that he has no fault to find with the Aus-
tralian air. He has personally inspected
the earth’s wrapping for about 6000 ft. up,
and says there is no undue number of holes
in it.
Ethel Warwick, who is Mrs. Edmund
Waller in private life, returned to Mel-
bourne last week. She posed in a box at the
Royal on Thursday night, and close observers
noticed that worry or something had
changed her hair from what it used to be
to red or gold—or maybe it was blue. She
smiled down on Julius, recollecting, no
doubt, her last visit, when she was his Mer-
cia. “Joseph and His Brethren” is her
theatrical engagement this time. She plays
the part of the wife of Potiphar, the man
who never knew the truth about that his-
toric scandal.
The cable flickered some news last week
about an exTAustralian mummeress who is
sueing a London theatrical management for
cribbing from her play. Rosemary Rees, the
lady in question, is the daughter of William
Rees, of the ALL. Parliament. She hails
from Hawkes Bay, and has long had literary
cravings. This is her second grab at over-
sea fame. She was in these parts three
years ago, when she was under engagement
to the late Herbert Flemming.
Dorothy Cumming got her first decent
chance on the professional stage in Knight’s
production of “Alan and Superman,” as
Violet Robinson. She was a very subdued
Dorothy, who delivered her lines in a cul-
chawed bleat. Still, her performance, on
the whole, served to confirm the worst sus-
picions. of her friends that the lady will do
something, histrionically speaking. To be-
gin with, she looked rather charming. Good
looks are a pleasing performance, anyhow.
“Walking on” parts in “Joseph and His
Brethren,” which is shortly to transpire
here, were rushed. Seventy females applied
for 14 positions. One interesting Alelbourne
girl, who is more or less favorably known
as an amateur, was confident of her chance,
as she had been told that she had a “Bibli-
cal face.” But she found that the ladies
were being judged, not o n their faces, but
on their busts, as it appears that they will
not be expected to do much in the way of
dressing. However, the Girl With the Scrip-
tural Features was given a small part on
general principles. The rest of her must
have been sufficiently Biblical.
A Tango class, under Hyams’ tuition,
meets every Thursday night at a big room
in Flinders-street over Whitelaw’s. It was
started only two Thursdays ago, but already
the number of Tango pupils has doubled,
and a number of quite the bong tong are
deeply . interested. As the Hyams sisters
teach it, Tango is graceful, humorous and
respectable, and not too beastly difficult.
Among early devotees Ambrose Patterson
and his pretty little wife are getting on
conspicuously well with the new flight of
steps.
It turns out that Irene Browne’s “lovely
Parisian frocks” (the ones she trails in
“Diplomacy”) were not made in Alelbourne,
as stated last week. They were constructed
in Sydney bv Farmer and Co., and Julius
Knight himself said that Paris couldn’t have
done them better.
Aubrey Hoad, son of the late General, is
now in Alelbourne at the head of a travelling
band of mummers, which he will personally
conduct to South Africa, after playing
through the country. At present he is
dazzling the city with his library of silk
socks. Alamma looks benignly on Aubrey
and co., and speaks with fond condescension
of the delightful doings of “that boy.”
“Alan and Superman” drew a trainload or
so of the Best People, on Friday night. The
eflorts of the Repertory Theatre have given
the Best an intellectual leg-up, and Bernard
Shaw is now their fashionable breakfast-
food. A few Government House odd jobs-
men were present of their own free will.
Burnham beamed alongside fiancee Alaggie
Niall, who showed a strip of sea-blue ninon,
a pleasant expanse of shoulder and a quart
or so of diamonds. Widower-pa was with
them, but kept his glasses and attention
riveted on Irene Browne, who stepped out
to supper with them later, in a green plush
opera coat and her red hair, fuzzed. Little
Alinister Willy Kelly, who had been chatter-
ing to _ the retiring G.-G. during the after-
noon, joined a Savoy supper party after the
plav, wearing the air of one who had saved
Europe from the horrors of war with one
hand, while solving the problem of the Sub-
merged Tenth with the other, and settling
the whole question of religious intolerance
with his feet. Captain Pollok and Tommy
Curwen supped confidentially at a corner
table, and consulted together like doctors.
Perhaps they were worrying about ' the
bother of getting another “place.” Nor-
man Hodges conducted a party of English
friends from the theatre to the general sup-
per rally, while Colonel Appleton’s girls had
a party at a centre table. Beatrice Day,
who had boxed with a strange, Spanish-
looking dame, also turned up for some late
nourishment. Frances Ross was noticed in
one of the Royal boxes before the stampede.
She waved a fan and showed -a paddy-green
bow above the edge of the pen. The whole
house seemed to rush down in a serried mass
to the one favorite place, which began to
get the real Tango look some time after mid-
night, but for goodness sake don’t mention
it!
From my Adelaide correspondent:—
The Colley-Stirling wedding occurred at Glenelg on
Jan. 28, in the presence of about 200 of theS. Australian
peei age, some of them in pink coats, the bridegroom
having last year been Master of the Hounds and
leader in the dashing pursuit of the aniseed ra°-
Miss Stirling, the elder of the Strathalbyn branch
of the clan, wore an orthodox white garment of
crOpe-de-Chine and Chantilly lace, and carried a
bunch of white phlox. The six bridesmaids were
Jean Stirling (shortly to be married herself), Mollie
Milne, Nellie Law-Smith, Monica Murray, Phyllis
Bray and Judy Whitby. They wore white, with
flashes of gold. Miss Murray, by the wav, will be
one of the season’s debutantes, and promises to be
a beauty. She is blue-eyed and golden-haired, and is
the only daughter of the A. J. Murrays, of Mount
Crawford. Archdeacon Bussell and the Rev. J.
Lumsden supplied the solemnities, and the Pier
Hotel the drinks and food.
The Governor farewelled South Australian racing
at the A.R.C. meeting on Anniversary Day. At the
official lunch W. B. Carr, the club’s chairman, said
nice things about the interest the Bosanquets had
taken in racing, and his Ex., in his turn, said nice
things about the pleasure racing had given him. On the
lawn were most of the usual people, some of them in
the usual clothes. Lady Bosanquet, who was there
with her daughters, is, by the way, greatly pleased
with the opal and diamond tiara which S. Aus has
given her. The A.R.C. had Providence on its "side
Owing to the scarcity of fluid, watering the course

“yEsculapius”: In ancient Greece they used to
erect temples over natural springs and give to each
a titular diety. We moderns are no less appreciative
of the healthful virtues of a mineral water —only our
methods differ somewhat. For instance, up at the
famous Helidon Spring, the water is secured just as
it bubbles up from the earth, and hermetically sealed
until the process of aeration and bottling is com-
plete. You don’t need a Greek fineness of palate to
appreciate the cool charm of Helidon Spa—it has
the same delicious refreshingni ss to Billjim as to the
Earl of Hopetoun. As a blender with wines and
spirits, too, it gives just that added snap and
sparkle that counts so much in the sum of pleasant-
ness. You’ll be wise to always make it a practice to
“Figaro”: Read a par. here the other week about
Nature planting the giant stinging nettle in N.Q.,
but close beside it the tree whose leaves serve as an
antidote to its sting. This provision of Nature is
in no way unique, for, just as she curses us with
indigestion so she blesses us with Helidon Spa.
After dining out you’ll have no next morning head-
ache if you take a bottle of “Helidon” before turning
in—this delicious mineral water is Nature’s gift to
those who have dined not wisely but too well. A single
glass will dissolve the undigested food and at the
same time ensure a perfect night’s rest. Quite apart
from its health aspect, “Helidon” greatly enhances
the flavor of wines and spirits—so truly the way of
wisdom is always to
SPLIT IT WITH
HELIDON.

POVERTYUS : “ What's this?"

“X.P.D.”: “Leo Lear’s” enlightening re-
marks about storm-cuckoos (B. 15/1/’l4) prompts
me to consult him professionally about a combina-
tion fish or animal I rescued from the sea-bottom
at Southport (Q.). The external part of it, or the
outside member of the partnership, whichever you
like to call it, was about a foot long, and shaped
like a rolled-up pancake. It was also brown and
squashy, and had no visible eyes, limbs, fins or
other usual trimmings. When I had handled it for
a few seconds it unrolled, or turned partly inside out,
or smiled, or something, without provocation, and
its partner, or active half, which was something like
a small whiting, and blonde in complexion, skipped
out from its inside and darted away. Was it one
creature or two, and, if two, was the inside indivi-
dual a prisoner or a lodger? Also, what was the
name or names of the creature or firm, and what
does it carry on like that for?

“Aloysius”: When I had said my nrayers
on New Year’s Eve, I was so sleepy that I forgot to
make the customary good resolutions for the coming
year. Whether what happened is the direct outcome
of such an omission or not I cannot say; but I am
determined not to forget them next time. Here’s
how I began the year:—
Jan. 1.-—Worked all day. (Bad enough for a
start.) Was challenged to a fight at teatime, and
decided to have a “go” in the morning. Lost thirty
bob at two-up.
Jan. 2.—Fight came off. Got a black eye and lost
a couple of square feet of skin from my face. Shook
hands and went into the town to have the other
man’s nose repaired.
Jan. 3.—Felt too tired to go back to work, so had
a stroll round the town.
Jan. 4 (Sunday).—Very thirsty in morning, until
Bung came to my relief with a quart of whisky.
Jan. s.—Fined ten bob. Adjourned to pub, and
made for camp in the afternoon.
Jan. 6.—Resumed work. Got my ticket at ten
o’clock for hiccupping during working hours.
Jan. 7. —Rolled up and went on tramp.
Jan. 8 (ef seq.). —-Still there.

“Tiaki”: There are plenty of places in
Maoriland which, if the native legends pertaining to
them were known, or if they were situated where the
gaping tourist could gaze on them while guide Polly
or Bridget rattled off their history in pidgin Eng-
lish, would become famous in the red-backed “guide-
book.” Matakitalci, which is a little distance from
the mouth of the Wairarapa Lake, is a place of great
interest to Ilenare. There is here a gigantic bowl,
as smooth as if it had been rubbed down with
emery paper, and in it are two or three fish called
nga ika o Kupe (the fish of liupe). Ilenare
asserts that, no matter whether calm or storm, the
fish are never absent. They are a peculiar sort of
spotted herring, and are not found anywhere else.
Near by is a huge rock of the same shape as the
canoe-sails used in Kupe’s time. Kupe was the first
Henare to visit Maoriland, which was probably before
John of Runnymede had signed the contract with
the public of Great Britain. He was supposed to
have had an argument with a monster octopus
at Castlepoint ( Te-rua-o-te-wheke-o-Rangiwhakaoma,
which signifieth the Cave of the Octopus of Rangi-
whakaoma), and, pursuing the Standard Oil emblem
along the coast, he landed at Matakitaki (the Look-
out) and made a sail for his boat over night. In
the darkness some Wowser turned the sail into stone.
Then he scooped a hole in the rock to wash his
hands, and, as he didn’t take the bowl away, it is
there to this day. You can see it, if you don’t be-
lieve the yarn without. Further on there is a
smooth-domed pillar of rock named Te Ure o
Kupe, which won’t hear translation. It was from
Matakitaki that he sighted the fleeing octo. which
he pursued to Picton, in the South Tsiand, and slew
there. It was at that place that he vailed for his
nephews in far-off Rarotonga, and, according to old
Maori custom, he gashed himself till the blood dyed
the adjacent scenery. Anyone doubting this may
see the rocks, seaweed and shellfish of that locality,
even to this day the color of a slaughter-yard. No-
body seems to covet Kupe’s Bowl, or the place where
he jabbed himself with the pawa shells; but a large
tract of sheep country comprising a number of boat-
shaped spurs and called Nga Waka o Kupe (Kupe’s
canoes) were the subject of much litigation in the
Wellington Supreme Court some time ago.
* * * *
“Alamon”: I took on a new-chum immi-
grant the other week, and, later, he confided to me
that the reason he left the first
station he went to was that they
had “started to shear sheep that
were still alive.” I thought he
was the limit till I struck an
English advertisement concerning
certain knitting wool. The pub-
lic was specially recommended
to buy this brand because it was
“clipped from the sheep while
alive in the meadows,” and was,
consequently, “the most durable,
elastic, warmest and healthiest” 1
Evidently the readers of that
advertisement are expected to
call up in imagination a picture
of a kindly gentleman strolling
among the daisies with a basket
in one hand and a pair of scissors
in the other, and carefully clip-
ping off the locks of wool that
most attract him, while the un-
suspecting sheep graze content-
edly round his tootsies.
* * #
“Jonfa”: Went net fishing the other
night, at the mouth of one of the trickles into the
Pacific on the Queensland coast. At the second haul
we caught something which appeared to be a small
shark. When we landed him we found him to be
what is locally known as an oyster fish. Our speci-
men weighed 151 b., but I believe they are caught
up to 251 b. They live on oysters—hence the
name. At the base of the mouth is a crushing mill
formed of two very hard, flat bones. They can eat
only the single oyster—the double bivalve interferes
with the stampers, and the beast doesn’t carry a
cyanide plant. The shell is crushed in the bat-
tery and then passed through the gills, and
the oyster is swallowed, all while you wait.
Ilalf-a-dozen of these fellows, let loose on a small
oyster-bed for an hour, would make it look as if
the mortgagee had foreclosed.
AN UPSTART.
FIRST IMMIGRANT: “’Ow dyer like yer noo p lice, Albert?"
SECOND DITTO: “ Rotten. These 'ere Haustralian masters don't know 'ow to behave.
Mine calls 'isself a gentleman, Eve no doubt; but 'e says ‘ Thank yer’ if I 'and 'in
anythink-an' the other day he actually says ‘ Good morning' to me!"
“H.”: Apropos the recent Bulletin yarn
of the outbacker who went to church for the first
time and found “the poorest counter-lunch he ever
struck,” a New York Congregational minister has
started a real free-lunch for his worshippers. Soup,
coffee, sandwiches and cakes are served before the
sermon. Kelly is his name, and he argues that
-pubs “really know human nature, whereas many
preachers do not,” so “to compete with the pub and
beat it” he proposes to “serve a better free lunch.”
But at the pub the counter-lunch isn’t the only
attraction, and the question is whether Kelly can
offer something to take the place of the beer.
* * * *
“Caber”: “Gil Gunnia” (B. 13/11/’l3),
in writing of Binghi’s manner of stowing away the
carcases of his kin, says our black brothers of West
Queensland have of late adopted our methods and
bury their dead underground. This might lead to
the supposition that tree-burials were the prevailing
fashion before the white man showed his equally
crude method of disposing of his dead.. The Darling
Downs and Moreton blacks planted their defuncts
doubled up, heads uppermost, between two sheets of
bark, and occasionally skeletons are unearthed that
show that mode of burial. Certainly the Wide Bay,
Burnett and Dawson niggers treed what they
couldn’t eat of the departed ones, which was darned
little besides the bones and pelt. But tree-burials
were never universal in Queensland.
* * * *
“X.P.D.”: The yarns of “Gil Gunnia”
(B. 13/11/’l3) and “Wallaby” (B. 15/1/’l4) about
the Binghi’s habit of putting their dead in trees
don’t disclose anything half so tough as a Papuan
Government expedition struck some years ago. The
party, consisting of white officials and native carriers
and police, arrived, after sundown, at a village from
which the local people had fled. Thinking to get
out of the dew, the white men spread their four-post
bedsteads on the floor of one of the houses —pro-
bably the bachelors’ quarters, where young bucks
are segregated from the hussies in grass petticoats.
But the roof didn’t seeem to be watertight, and the
campers suffered mild inconvenience from water
splashing on their blankets throughout the night.
The night’s discomforts were, however, nothing com-
pared with what they felt in the morning, when they
looked up and saw that the drippings came from a
very dead body slung up in the rafters. The
deceased probably represented a war-trophy, ripening
for future consumption; anyway, friends and relatives
are mostly buried beneath the floors of the houses—
though even that is only done now at the risk of
considerable gaol.
“G. Over” : A number of suspicious-look-
ing ticks were lately discovered by an energetic
junior stock inspector upon some old dairy cows that
were scratching for a living about Toowoomba. Said
ticks, with the help of the Tick Board, were sur-
rounded, cleverly captured, warned that any admis-
sions they made might appear in evidence against
AFTER THE ACCIDENT.
WIFEY (as hubby hits the ground): “ There!
How careless of you, John! Didn't I tell
you I had on my new hat"
them, and sent handcuffed in a matchbox to head-
quarters for inspection and verification. Meanwhile
the alarm rang over the Downs like the crash of a
busted bank in Edinburgh after Flodden, and the
scare was only arrested when headquarters wired
back: “Not cattle ticks at all; they are castor-oil
seeds.”
(Continued, on page 24.)
THE SHADOW.
[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
A weary man and hopeless,
A man with woes unguessed,
He went a-down the highway
That reaches to the West.
Oh, sorrow on the hard fate
That man and maid must bear —-
With bread to buy and rent to pay
And worlds and worlds of care.
He took the Western highway,
A troubled soul and sore,
And in the golden morning
His Shadow went before.
His Shadow went before him,
And it was grim and black;
And ever through morn’s splendor
He trod his Shadow’s track.
The woodland lay about him,
All winsome in its wiles,
With little mind to heed it
He trudged the dusty miles,
Now came the great All-Mother
Who dwells among the trees,
And sits behind the mountains,
And walks beside the seas.
’Tis she who soothes the sick heart
And takes away its pain,
And puts the red blood in it
And makes it whole again.
’Tis she has many voices
And many wonder-words,
And some the breezes utter,
And - some the singing birds.
’Tis she that lays the soft hand
Upon our aching eyes,
And woos us into slumber
With cooing lullabies.
’Twas where the highway lingers
To view a river-scene
She came upon him smiling,
All dressed in forest-green.
She took him in her round arms,
And caught him to her breast,
And couched him on the bracken,
And lulled his soul to rest.
And while he softly slumbered—
Limbs stretched to all their length—
She filled his heart with courage
And filled his soul with strength.
She made him meet for battle,
And armed him for the fight;
And through the golden evening
He journeyed spirit-light.
A dancer on the mountains
He whistled down the wind ;
And in the Western sunbeams
His Shadow went behind.

YOUR ADVANTAGES.
There are a number of distinct ADVANTAGES TO YOURSELF in buying a Beale Piano in preference to any other. Here are
some of them :
1. You make a Big: Saving in Price, Quality for Quality.
You buy your Beale Piano direct from the factory, without paying profits to any middlemen or agents, and
without paying the 35 per cent. Customs duty.
2. You get a Better=toned Piano. , . . , .
Beale Pianos have a most harmonious, mellow, delightful tone. They contain the only successful steel
tuning-system ever invented, and by means of this device the tuning-pins are held, firmly for all time,
confiinng all sound to the sounding-board, which is the only proper construction.. This invention makes the
piano more durable, because the iron frame alone bears all the tremendous strain (nearly 30 tons) of the two
hundred and sixteen tightly-stretched steel strings. This construction cannot be had in any other pianos.
3. A Better=toned Piano because, also, of the Violin=like Sounding Board.
Only Beale Pianos contain sounding-boards constructed on the same principle as. a violin-belly.. this
construction, and our secret sounding-board varnish, are responsible for that splendid tone which wins such
favor with singers especially. The Beale tone is sympathetic, sweet, mellow, sonorous and lasting .. Ihe
tone of Beale Pianos, beautiful at first, improves with use. This is the sure test of an artistically-
constructed piano.
4. You get a Longer=lasting Piano. ...
Beale Pianos are made in the Australian climate, of timber seasoned in the Australian climate, so they will
withstand the Australian climate better than pianos which are made in cold, wet countries.
5. Your Beale Piano will have a Better Touch. .
We supply a better u action ” one of the most expensive parts of the instrument —m Beale Pianos than you
find in any other pianos of similar price. We supply the recognised best action in the world in our 70-guinea
Beale Pianos, whereas you must pay not less than /105 for an imported piano containing the same action-
system. It provides that perfect touch demanded by master-pianists.
6. You gain by the Unique Experience of probably the Greatest Piano Expert in the World.
Associated with the founder of this Company (Mr. O. C. Beale) is Mr. George D. Rose, for many.years Technical
Director of Messrs. John Broadwood & Sons, London, now acting exclusively as out Technical Expert and
Factory Manager. Mr. Rose is the third generation in his family to devote a lifetime to high-grade piano
making. He has had a unique experience in all branches of the art in the best piano factories of England,
Germany, France and America, and is recognised in Europe as probably the greatest expeit m tone-
production in the world. He has invented epoch-making improvements in pianos. He was for over twelve
vears President of the British Piano Makers’ Association.
7. You get a Written Guarantee from us—the MAKERS—for twenty=five years.
No other maker guarantees his pianos for such a lengthy period—ten years is the usual thing. But we know
how Beale Pianos are constructed, and we know they will last longer than any otheis. In any case, if you
buy an imported piano you will find that the guarantee (if any) thereon will not be of much value, to you, as
the maker is in Europe, twelve thousand miles distant from you ; whereas we are here, in Australia, with ah
our interests in Australia, ready to support our guarantee on the spot.
8. Only Beale Pianos have quite Reliable Bass=strings.
You know that in all pianos the strings (steel wires) in the bass portion are wound with copper or other wire
to make them heavier, and thus afford the necessary slow vibrations. In Beale Pianos these steel wires are
six-sided, instead of round, and thus afford a firm grip for the copper winding. Consequently no Beale Piano
ever develops buzzing noises caused by loose binding of the bass-strings. Other Pianos have round steel wire m
the bass, affording no secure grip for the copper. Six-sided steel wire costs more than twice as much as the round.

ROBERT HURST,
14 & 16 RUSSELL STREET,
MELBOURNE.
“F.H.” : A new inducement to the Aus-
tralian to hang on to his own has been discovered
ih Melbourne’s oak-planted suburbs. Thousands upon
thousands of British oak line the streets of suburbia
and occupy space in the gardens thereof, where with
at least equal beauty, and with much greater
utility, Australian evergreens would have served.
Now the thing has to be done all over again, since
a scale insect has come along to destroy the oak.
In England, it is alleged, this scale cannot thrive,
on account of the weather. The Australian climate,
however, helps it to increase and multiply, with the
result that there are practically no British hoax in
Melbourne now free from the pest. The oak is a
gaunt skeleton during the sunny winters of Aus-
tralia ; it robs the ground tilled by the suburban
Carnation-growet; it gives immense trouble to the
street-scavengers during Windy autumn weather ; and
how i t prepares to die the slow, unsightly death of
an undesirable immigrant.
“Charred Fence”: Dauber’s impromptu
holiday bush fire happened Some years ago in the
picnic district about Heidelberg (Vie.). A few
artists who could find nothing better to do on a
blistering public holiday, adventured into the wilder-
ness, and, after tramping for several blinding miles,
ventured to have a bath in a brackish creek, just
where the high banks were heavily screened with
scrub. To guard against surprise by roaming
picnickers, they kept one man on watch while the
others cooled themselves; so it came to pass that
at last one lone man (the sentry) was dressing him-
self slowly in a hollow filled waist-deep with fern
tinder. He had very little on, when the worst
lunatic in the party threw a lighted match amongst
the rubbish just behind his bare shins. The flame
blinked once; then the whole gully seemed to sigh
deeply. Next thing the painters knew, the fire had
poured tempestuously across the creek, the air was
full of smoke, and a shouting man was trying to
cram two singed legs into one barrel of his trousers.
Away on the other side of the rolling smoke curtain
(the fire had fortunately rushed away from them)
the incendiaries could hear, above the crackle and
hiss of the fire, the howls of terrified picnickers and
the rattle of billies and crockery being gathered in
ON THE TRACK.
THE WOWSER: " Well, when you want help
why don't you call to the One above
THE SWAGGIE: “ Where does he slop?"
haste. Without a moment’s hesitation (the half-
dressed man cursed them heartily for it) they hurried
away over the hills to the local pub, and sat there
decently in cool seclusion, while the residents of the
district fought like one lot of maniacs for their
houses and crops and cursed the picnickers, who
cursed back and fought like another lot of maniacs
for their buggies, vans and personal property. Then,
at the end of the day, when the fire was beaten anil
both sets of fighters came to soak themselves in
refreshment, the artists drank gravel}' and im-
partially with both factions and agreed that some-
body deserved to be shot.
“Ideas”: A monthly magazine recently wrote: “Pig
iron is worth 20 dollars a ton. ~ Mix it with an
idea —make it into horseshoes—and it is worth 90
dollars. Add more ideas, and make knife blades,
and it is worth 200 dollars. Add still more ideas,
putting it through a more intricate process, and it
emerges as watch springs, which are worth 1000
dollars. The raw iron was worth 20 ; the ideas added
to its value 980 dollars.” Phillips Ormonde & Co.,
patent attorneys, 17 Queen Street, Melbourne.*

“ But how is it y' so short
of brass y'self?”
“ A mysty, Bill, a
myst’ry! All I knows

“Tom Donohoe” : It was on a Murchison
(W.A.) goldfield called Jillawarra. Some say that
it’s Juliawarra, as Julia was the name of the
gin who first discovered gold there. Jock Renock
picked up a quartz specimen containing of gold
out on a flat near Dingo Creek. The spot was con-
spicuous by a giant gidyea tree that grew half a
chain away. Jock and his mate took a dryblower,
and for three or four days made as much as they
could of W.A. fly to the four winds of Heaven, but
without success. Then my mate and I came and
scattered more dust for three and a half days. We
got nothing, and sought fresh fields. Nearly two
years afterwards I passed that way, and, to my sur-
prise, the country for a radius of 10 chains round
that tree looked as if it had had a bad attack of
small-pox ; it was pitted with shallow shafts. I went
over to a solitary old dryblower and asked if he
was getting anything. He said, “No, not even a
flyspeck.” Still, he said, something must have been
found to account for all the work done. I saw
ssmeone sitting under the big tree, and went over to
him. He was an old nigger called Larry, who, like
myself, had been away on the walkabout for many a
day and many a mile, and had just returned. “Well,
Larry,” I said, “you find ’em any gold?” “No find
’em,” he replied—“you got ’em bacca?” I gave
him a pipeful of extra-strong, and when the blue
curling clouds began to ascend, he viewed the land-
scape and exclaimed: “By Cripe, this place close-up
nothing know-’em now.” A few more puffs. “Long
time ago me little boy here. Nothing look for gold
them times. Nothing know-’em. One day walkabout
long way. My father and more blackfellow sit down
under this tree. I go over to creek to bring bubba
[water]. In creek I pick up pritty fellow stone.
I show-’em to my father. ‘What you bring that?’
he say. ‘That no good to eat.’ Then he trow him
at my little brother, him holding firestick to a dog’s
nose. By Cripe, I know that fellow stone now,
suppose I find him.” Then he gave a broad grin, and
shook his old head. “And where was your brother
when your father threw the stone at him?” I in-
quired. “Over there.” And he pelted a clod of
earth at the tree—where Jock found his specimen.
Which is a true history of a W.A. dry blown patch.
* * * *
“Gadsby”: “I’ll rise yer a bullock.” I
heard this ejaculation at a wayback pub in Gippsland
from one of a group of four bullockies playing draw
poker. I asked the barman what coin of the realm
a “bullock” designated. “A bullock ain’t a coin,”
he replied, “it’s a beast.” Light began to dawn
on me. I asked in amazement whether they were
playing £lO rises, which was the average price of
bullocks then. He nodded and informed me that
the same four men played every second week. They
were punchers who owned good herds, and every
fortnight they drove some 50 or 100 animals
past the pub and always stopped for a drink or so
and a “little” game. They won alternately, he said,
but the night I was there one man scooped the pool
and filled all his pockets with bullocks.
TRIED THEM DOUBTINGLY.
“I was out of sorts through irregularity of the
bowels and constipation,” writes Mr. Thomas Rodda,
Ouse, Tas. “Seeing an advertisement on Chamber-
lain’s Tablets, I decided to try them, but did so
doubtingly, as so many medicines had failed. The
result was so satisfactory that I now carry a bottle
of Chamberlain’s Tablets in my pocket wherever I
go.”*
“Cleveland”: I once went out with a
dynamite expert who had received peremptory orders
to destroy about two tons of high explosives. We
got out of the train at a sleepy station, where a
cadaverous person met us. He at once started to
point out that he was due back at the station at
train time—“so we'll have ter get a move on,’’ he
concluded. I subsequently learned that he was
engaged to do the carting of the stuff by ''contract.
We got one load aboard and streaked away to the
place chosen for our purpose. The contractor tore
open the cases on the way, and when the cart
arrived at the right spot it was tipped up and the
whole consignment shot out. X asked the expert
what the stuff was condemned for, and he stopped
long enough to holler “Super-sensitiveness—the rotten
thing goes off if you look at it sideways.” A train
tooted in the distance, and this stirred the pair of
them to even wilder efforts. My nerves gave out
when the expert and his cadaverous disciple, not
content with opening the cases on the way, started
emptying the loose plugs into the bottom of the
cart. 1 mizzled off in search of solitude. At the
station the station-mistress made staggering calcula-
tions on chaotic timetables, and kept a wary eye on
the cash-drawer wherein reposed 4s. 9d., the morn-
ing’s takings. Two horses attached to a milk-cart
slumbered fitfully. The milkman divided his time
between a book of bad debts and the station-mistress.
Two Hindus squatted round giving out their views
for the benefit of all and sundry. I was just working
out how much further I would like to be away from
that pair of maniacs now tearing through the forest
with a cart full of death and destruction, when the
whole landscape lifted, and sat down again hurriedly.
The milk-cart followed the two slumberous horses
into the booking-office; their driver had preceded
them by a fraction of a second. The two Hindus
fought desperately for pride of place under the tank.
Blue-ruin pervaded the station generally. Things
were just steadying down sufficiently to enable a
man to take hold again, when rocks, trees, dead
snakes and deader marines started to fall from
Heaven, ’i got a whang in the ear and took eight
minutes of the count, waking just in time to avoid
being trampled to death by a mob of goats that
were stampeding to claim sanctuary under the
station. When at last peace was restored I started
out to find the destroyers, and met them on their
way to the station. The cadaverous one had his
whiskers blown off, and both were as deaf as beetles.
They didn’t want to hear what the scandalised in-
habitants had to say about them, anyhow.
“X.P.D.”: Whether James Tyson deserved
all the things Randolph Bedford wrote of him in
the New Year’s Day Bulletin I don’t know. Pro-
bably Old Jimmy himself would have smiled dryly
at the idea of his “great thoughts beneath the
stars” being about anything more exalted than the
price of fats or the Felton ration scale. All the
same, he wasn’t the old skinflint that the wasps
who have fastened on to Bedford’s hide want to
make out. My father did a long droving trick with a
mob of Tyson’s cattle, and at the end of the job,
handed one more beast than he had signed for. (The
mob consisted partly of cows, and when one of them
calved the encumbrance was given a passage on the
bullock-dray till it was fit for the road.) Old Jimmy
liked nothing better than economy, and gave my
father £lOO over the money due. His acts may
have always had self-interest at the back of them ;
but, anyhow, he came in mighty handy at a tight
place sometimes —notably when, about 1893, Philp’s
calamitous Government was issuing Treasury Bills
without much hope of takers, till Old Jimmy led
off with something like £lOO,OOO worth. And what
a skewer Tyson would be in the side of the Meat
Trust 1 His few millions wouldn’t avail against theirs,
but his cool head and longsightedness in business
problems would make him an ugly snag in a sea
of affability.
“Coyote”: As a general rule the Papuan
tribes bury their dead with considerable ceremonial;
but to preserve records of their mighty deeds they
are committed to music, and in song and chant are
handed down to posterity. In addition, some tribes
preserve the skulls and some of the bones of their
renowned chiefs. I know of only one exception to
the general rule, which was discovered recently in a
Ivukukuku village at the headwaters of the Tiviri
River. In one house of the village, a mummy of a
male native was found. It was well preserved, and
was kept so by smoke arising from the fire in the
circular hearth made in the centre of the house.
Quite a number of Ivukukuku villages have received
unexpected visits from a few white men, including
the writer, and the mummy abovementioned is the
only one that has been met with. So far as I am
aware, this is the first mummy recorded as having
been found amongst Papuan tribes.
“Prospector” : Ever seen the torch-carrying
centipede, which is found along the Westralian
rabbit-proof fence, in the vicinity of Youanmi? I
have. One hot evening I was lying out on a tar-
paulin on which my blankets were spread, when I
saw a bright light at a distance of 30 yards. The
flare was about one-half candle-power. It made
straight for me, and when I started to investigate l
found a XOin. centipede, of ordinary appearance,
which emitted the lighthouse or gas monopoly from
its head. It seemed to be able to turn the illumina-
tion on and off at will. I captured the insect, bird,
fowl or reptile, but it died and went bad in captivity.
From the perfume it made then I think it uses
carbide.

“5.8.”: He was an American and stood
before one of Brangwyn’s masterpieces in the Sydney
Art Gallery, gazing critically over it. The brilliant
yellow of his tan boots blended harmoniously into
the deep green of his clocked socks. The startling
pattern of his clothes struck one with its very bold-
ness, and his red tie caressed the yellow of his shirt.
Resting lightly on the top of him was a circular
arrangement with a black and red band to protect
him from the sun. He caressed his face with his
hand. After much consideration he remarked in a
rounded drawl, and very patronisingly, “Hymph.
Nope. I can’t say I like Brangwyn’s riot of colors.”
GLAD HE WAS DEAD.
CONCEITED ACTOR: “ And in the final scene
where I die, the audience rose as one man,
and cheered!”
CANDID FRIEND: “Damn bad form, but you
couldn't blame them!”
LAST NIGHT.
[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
Last night a cozening memory played
Upon a harp of mist
The tune of pearly dreams was made
In beds of amethyst.
All through the day my sick heart seems
To languish for that harp of dreams.
Last night the river lay asleep
Within the rushes’ arms,
Reflecting in her bosom deep
The moon above the palms.
Now in the yellow sunburned noon
Her breast still holds the midnight moon.
Last night the wind was like a lute
That quivers through the trees,
To flush the rinds of laggard fruit
With spurring mockeries.. . .
To-day in branches limp and mute
1 still can hear that restless lute.

“0.K.”: “General Average,” who talks like the
commanding-officer of a fire-insurance company,
doesn’t command my admiration for his attack on
my par. re the insurance combine. He says: “Natur-
ally, if ‘a marvellous epidemic of fires in brick dwell-
ing houses’ should occur, rates would rise.” Why
naturally? Also, he asks, “Who wants better odds
than £lOO to 2s. Od. ?” In which query he reminds
me of the liberal bookmakers who offer 800 to 1
against a “treble,” which is a 10,000 to 1 risk. My
contention was this: The combined offices make
every epidemic of fires an excuse, not for maintain-
ing their general average of profits, but for increas-
ing it in the future. Thus, taking the profit on the
insurance of detached brick dwelling-houses to have
been 80 per cent, on the past 29 years’ average, an
epidemic which suddenly reduced the profit to 70
per cent, for a 30 years’ period would be followed by
a rise in rates with a view to making the average
profit 85 per cent, for the next 30 years. The drol-
lest defence of the combine I have heard was that
of an insurance boss who said that whilst a number
of non-union companies (ill-managed, or started
with insufficient capital) had collapsed, there had
been no failure among the combine. Quite so. I
suggest that the rates of the old-established com-
panies with a combine schedule are so highly protec-
tive that even bad management cannot bring one of
them to grief. How else can we account for a one-
and-sixpenny original share in any one co. being
worth 50s. to-day ?
* * * *
“A.J.W.”: I greet “J.D.S.” (B. 8/l/’l4) as a
brother when he remarks that Australia should pro-
duce the best; but I am at a loss to understand his
abuse of Australian leather. His main argument
against the local article applies really to the English
product, viz., that it is brittle and dry. Most Aus-
tralian leathers are, on the contrary, what the trade
terms “mellow,” and that is considered a good qual-
ity. Furthermore, English leather is “loaded” up
to the hilt —a feature in which the local product
shows up very favorably. I’ll guarantee that the
local product wears better than the imported. I
have tested it by placing English on one boot and
Australian on the other, and the local article wins
by lengths every time. “J.D.S.” throws a boom-
erang when he states that the proof is in the prices
paid. Australian leather costs as much as English,
and more. I buy both, and pay for the best English
to-day 2s. 4d. to 2s. 6Jd. per lb., and for the Aus-
tralian article 2s. sd. to 2s. 7d. These prices are
for prime material only. Both can be bought cheaper,
no doubt. If the local article is so brittle, why have
we foreign buyers bidding against our own, and
offering greater prices? “J.D.S.” can see this for
himself if he will attend any of the sales. As a
matter of fact, Australian leather has proved so good
that it is hard to buy it here now, and so great is
the demand that where five years ago prime local
leather could be had by the ton at Is. 9d. per lb.,
the same can now be secured only with great difficulty
at 2s. sd. and 2s. 7d. per lb. As for “J.D.S.’s”
remarks that English leather is used in belting in
preference to Australian, I would like to ask him
what, in that case, J. C. Ludowici and dozens of
other belt manufacturers are keeping tanneries for?
Shopkeepers at the west and expensive end of
Rundle-street, Adelaide, are appealing to Heaven and
the newspapers against the fruit-hawkers who stand
hy the kerb and shout. This busy part of Adelaide’s
busiest street has been turned into a “Paddy’s
Market,” which has much increased in size and smell
and row since Parliament refused to approve a
corporation by-law that would have moved the bar-
rows on. A batch of vendors was fined lately, but
with little effect. A shopkeeper bitterly complains
(1) that he can’t hear his telephone for the noise
just outside, (2) that his customers have to leave
their carriages on the other side of the street and
wade to him through banana-skins, and (3) that a
£5 fine is no use against a hawker taking £3O or
£4O a day and with no rent to pay.
* * * *
“Kunasarta” : Re copra-growing (B. 7/l/’l4). The
writer of the Age article in question professes no
expert knowledge—only that gained by a four years’
stay in copra country, and a later extended tour of
the Solomons, where special opportunities were given
for seeing the best and biggest plantations. If there
are not fine profits in the business, why do the big
firms compete for properties ? Several estates changed
hands whilst I was in the Solomons. One of 200
acres, full bearing, realising £17,000; another of
about 170 acres realised £12,000. The buyers were
experienced copra-growers, not amateurs. Planted
quincunx fashion, 40 trees go to the acre, and a
dividend of 10s. per tree is not too high a figure
when copra is £32 per ton. My critic mentions
75., which is about right for trees planted irregularly
and closely; but, even so, the result per acre will
be about equal to those I gave—say, from £BOO to
£lOOO to the small grower, from a plantation of
40 acres. By misadventure, 1 must have written
pounds where I meant shillings in quoting the divi-
dend per tree; but in mentioning the net result per
acre, I was right, and that really was the main
point. As to undergrowth, there is little difficulty,
and no very hard subsequent labor, if the initial
clearing of the land be well done. In Timor, permis-
sion is given to the natives to cultivate between the
rows such crops as they wish for their own use. They
grow maize, sugar, tobacco, sago, bananas or pines,
and keep the ground in excellent order, without
expense to the holder. The Age article offered a
suggestion that the Federal Government should follow
the example of the Government in the Solomons,
where all costs of administration are repaid to the
Imperial Treasury from the Government plantations
at Tulaigi and other stations. None of these officially-
run holdings are of great area; and there are
millions of acres of such country along the Territory
foreshores and river frontages, where, if the native
were taught and trained to earn his rations, instead
of, as now," depending on the misguided charity of
the State, he might easily clear and prepare large
holdings for copra growing, being encouraged thereto
by the growth of fruits and tobacco, for which latter
his taste is so keen. In conclusion, if my critic is
not sufficiently spry to dodge falling nuts—or if,
as is possible, he has already suffered from such an
accident—he had better keep out of the business. As
for the Federal Government, it should be fairly safe
in following such shrewd financiers as the Levers
and Burns, Philp and Co.
* * * *
“Vagabond”: The Norwegian Government has cast
overboard the old steering orders and issued a new
and sensible set.. After July 1, 1914, the orders will
be “Hoire” (right) and “Venstre” (left), instead of
“Styrboard” (which thinly disguises “Starbogrd”)
and “Bakboard” (which means the other thing).
“Hoire” means that the ship’s rudder is to be turned
to starboard (or right), and “Venstre” that it turns
to port (or left). A non-naUtical reader might
imagine that the orders couldn t mean anything
else” He may not know that when a British seaman
is told “starboard” (which means right) he turns
the steering wheel to port, and the ship’s head turns
to the left. The contrariness *is a survival of the
days when ships steered with a tiller, and the order,
“Port,” meant to push the tiller to port, when, of
course, the rudder and ship turned to starboard.
Other nations are dropping the old orders, and British
seaman almost alone stick to them. As seamen swap
ships fairly often this is apt to be mighty confusing,
and there is now talk of adopting for international
use some orders like “Right wheel" and Left
wheel,’’ which would mean what they say. When a
ship is in a ticklish position, and a Dutch or Dago
steersman gets the British order hurled at him, he
is liable to bump something before he remembers
whether it means what it says, or just the opposite.
“Ricardo": Astounding the development of what
are called multiple shops in this beehive of Britain,
with its workers and its drones, its honey and its
decaying honeycomb. The company called the Home
Stores, in London, has 683 shops, Lipton has 500,
and the Maypole Dairy Co. 800. Eastman has nearly
1300 meatshops, Nelson over 1300. Welford, dealing
only in milk, has 32 branches. One boot and shoe
firm has about 460 shops; Lilley and Skinner have
76 in London alone, Saxon’s 50, and Manfield s 68,
though some of them are on the Continent. Dunn,
the hatters, have 50 branches; Jaeger, of the wools,
21. Boot’s Drug Co., with huge manufactories, hasuoO
branches. Sixteen tobacco firms, with £11,000,1)00
capital, have over 6100 shops.

Ericstein was arrested in Melbourne a while back,
when running a very profitable little business, one
of the chief advantages of which lay in the fact
that the proprietor was not put to the expense of
hiring hands to dust the stock. There was no stock.
Neither was there a shop. A little preliminary ex-
pense for advertisements and a knife for slitting open
letters were practically all Ericstein put into his
enterprise—apart, of course, from his magnificent
business ability. The gentle Jew advertised an
excellent, electro-plated cruet, with three bottles and
a charming artistic design, for half a crown. Or, if you
preferred them, six tablespoons, six .dessertspoons, and
six teaspoons, beautifully electro-plated. I here
were several other magnificent articles of electro-
plated ware Ericstein was willing to send for half a
crown, the alarming sacrifice being accounted for by
the fact that Ericstein was representing a colossal
German firm which was bent upon capturing the Aus-
tralian trade in plated goods. Ericstein s method
was simple, clever and amusing. He just neglected
to supply the articles advertised, or any other articles.
He took in the money-orders and postal-notes in
bushels, then curled up in his office, waiting for
more Ericstein was the original discoverer of the
great idea that if for half a crown you offer women
more than anybody could possibly give for the money,
you can rely upon receiving about two-thirds of the
half-crowns in circulation. This good man has had
many disciples, but is now in gaol. Asked by the
detectives why he didn’t deliver the goods, Ericstein
replied with warmth: “Teliver dcr goots. Talk
sense, vy don’d yeh? If I teliver der goots, vere
does my profit come in?”

was in Craig’s Royal Tar, built in N.S.W. about
38 years ago. We made a passage of 58 hours from
Melbourne to Newcastle, and during the same voyage
left Newcastle on Wednesday afternoon at three
o’clock, and arrived at Auckland in four days 20
hours, beating the steamer Elingamite by about five
hours. She could sail 1 I have seen her clear Port
Phillip Heads at 9 a.m., and at 10.30 pass the
Schank (17 miles). Nobody deplores the loss of
those vessels more than I. The men they turned out
were the best on the coast —smart, steady, sober
and industrious, mostly Victorians and Maorilanders.
I have had more than a dozen of them under me in
the last three years, and I never had occasion to
complain once. Most of them left the Craig vessels,
came into steam for a while to make a few pounds,
and then went up for their ticket. All that I know
of have passed and gone into lime-juicers until they
can get their master’s certificate. The training the
young fellows got in those vessels will make them
the best of officers, or it’s their own fault, and it’s
a pity the little fleet could not have been kept
going —even if the States had to give Craig a small
subsidy. We may need all our smart sailormen some
day.
THE J.P.
[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
Behold his slow and pompous gait,
The unctuous pillar of the State;
as slowly through his native town,
He portly passes up and down.
Here was he born, and here he strove,
Here he grew honored as he throve;
On yonder inconspicuous street
He toddled on his baby feet.
Yon tumbling cottage all forlorn
Ts where the great I AM was born.
His mother, poor and humble soul,
Was left upon a parish dole ;
Eked out, as such aids often are,
By small results of “wash and char.”
The infant J.P. had sound blood,
So grew and flourished in the mud,
The small boy J.P. was no fool,
But fought and held his own at school.
No boy could bounce as well as he
Born to become a good J.P.
Behold him now with pompous gait,
Become a pillar of the State;
At school he learned that two and two
Will make whate’er you want them to ;
Five for yourself, or if it be
For others profit, only three.
1V» learned to write an awful fist
By help of elbow and of wrist.
Superfluous, grammar passed him by,
His only part of speech was “I.”
Nor will he now, if he orate,
Aspire to touch the aspirate.
From school, apprentice be became,
And made for promptitude a name;
Always full early at the shop,
Ever the last his task to drop.
Then, when his term was done, he made
His first lone hand attempt to trade;
Ilis coppers into silver turned,
And he invested what he earned.
And so began the man’s career,
So doth the born J.P. appear.
lie started “works,” no more a “hand,”
Or petty trader in the land ;
His mills to coin turned all his grist,
And he became a Capitalist.
With due respect men spoke of him,
And swelling out in girth and limb,
With consequential air and gait
He looked a pillar of the State.
And like most lowly when they thrive
In politics Conservative.
A champion strong for £ s. d.
And vested interests was he.
And oft in argument opined
That Poverty should be resigned.
Sometimes between two feelings torn,
“See me, and I was poorly born” ;
As if it were not finer pride
His early poverty to hide.
On Sunday, in the church endowed
By his munificence, aloud
He thanks God for his benefits,
In seeret thanking his own wits;
(As well he may, unless God’s plan,
Somehow includes the self-made man).
He marries, as of course is right,
The daughter of a neighbor knight.
(Some day—so strange is human life
Of noble knight she may be wife).
And so the social seal is set,
And he goes forward, upward yet.
Already pillar of the State,
He is become a magistrate;
And deals out Justice in the place,
With magisterial mien and face.
His fellow-men before him stand,
Admonished by his pompous hand ;
Reproved, condemned, dismissed or fined,
By glorious Justice wise and blind;
As awful in his greatness drest,
As though the ermine crowned his breast.
What wonders yet are in the plan
God knows —or else the self-made man —-
But God, who made and cares for me,
Save me from being a J.P.

POLITICAL
POINTS
N.S.W. Premier Holman may be up against
a big difficulty if he attempts to swamp the
Upper House with a large batch of nominees
in order to secure a majority for the aboli-
tion of the effete concern. There is some-
thing of a recognised right to swamp the
GETTING PAST A JOKE.
The decision of the Political Labor Conference
that the Legislative Council must be abolished prob-
ably ends the matter as far as the Labor party is
concerned. —S. M. Herald, 30/1/’14.
THE POOR OLD GHAP: It—it’s—n—not—f—
fair—t—to—fri—frighten-m—me—li—like
— t — th —this!”
Upper House in case of a deadlock, but if his
Ex. asks “Where is the deadlock?” the
goods can’t be produced. The present Leg.
Council hasn’t refused to pass the Bill for
its own abolition, for no such Bill has ever
been sent to it. According to the Labor
programme the thing ought to have been
sent long ago, but it wasn’t. So the Upper
Tomb or Top Corpse has the chance of an-
other lease of life.
“Henry H.” : It was truly great to hear
Brother Robinson Fishball, Chief Grand
Orange' Cockadoodle of Victoria, assuring
his hearers the other day (1) that Home
Rule (which Australia has got) involved
the break-up of the Empire; (2) that
“Australian and Victorian blood” (Victoria
has two different kinds of Home Rule—
State and Federal) would be shed if neces-
sary to prevent Ireland getting the thing
that this country wouldn’t part with at any
price. A most interesting person is Brother
Robinson Puffball.
PLAYING FOR SAFETY.
AGGRESSIVE INDIVIDUAL : “Look here, my
wife complains that you've been winking
at her!"
LITTLE MAN (who had): “ Nonsense, sir.”
(Raising his voice) “Confound it, man,
if you will take a beautiful woman about
in public you must expect her to be stared
at! And if my eyes blinked at the sight
of such loveliness ”
THE WIFE : “Do be quiet, Jack. I’m sure
the gentleman didn’t mean any harm.”
In Westralia the infant has a big say in
Labor politics. Every member of a union
has a voice in the selection of the party can-
didate, and since shop assistants, clerks and
domestic helps have been organised, quite a
lot of the voting power belongs
to partly-grown boys and flap-
pers, who are still amenable to
corruption by means of lollies
and picture-show tickets. The
Kalgoorlie miners were the first
to “drop” to the position, and
a hasty movement is in progress
to tear the flapper’s vote from
her.
The Yic. Rifle Association is
calling the Defence Department
to account for what’s the mat-
ter with some of the cartridges
supplied to rifle clubs. The
case of a bullet that dropped
dead at 300 yards is awaiting an
inquest. And there have been
so many cases of bullets falling
short of expectations that
shooters are wondering whether
a long-distance foe would ever
get picked off in time of need under existing
conditions.
From the circular accompanying the new
agreement submitted by the C.S.R. to the
sugar-grov*ers of the North: —
The term of the agreement has been made three
years instead of five, as hitherto, because there is
now a grave risk of the production of sugar in Aus-
tralia exceeding the consumption of the Common-
wealth.
Further evidence of the disastrous result of
the abolition of colored labor, which was
•going to wipe the Australian sugar business
right out, it being just as well known that
white men couldn’t stand the work in the
canefields as it is that they can’t stand agri-
cultural work in the Northern Territory.
But if Australia grows too much sugar why
not import more people to use the sugar,
and find employment for these people by
importing less clothes, boots, hats,
machinery, etc.?
The seven-hundredth wharf-laboring dis-
pute that Sydney has had during the last
two minutes was conferred upon last Friday,
but as nothing new was done any old thing
may now happen. Out of a confusion of
assertions on both sides re the drop in profits,
and the increased cost of burial, and the
precarious character of wharf employment,
and the precarious nature of the ship’s bot-
tom, and the precarious position of the man-
aging director when his wife finds him at
Manly with another girl, very little was said
that was definite enough to be worth record-
ing. But another strike is probably in sight.
Commerce is a long, unhandy brute that is
always getting muddled and tied up like
that.
The S’African
Botha Government
has solved the
strike trouble by
the simple expedi-
ent of arresting the
leaders and deport-
ing them. Whether
a British subject
can be legally de-
ported from one
part of the Empire
to another doesn’t
matter just now,
though no doubt the
question will raise
some dust later on.
Supposing the thing
to be legal, where
is the deportation
game to end? If a
capitalistic Govern-
ment can do this
sort of thing with
Labor agitators,
presumably a Labor
Gbvernment can do
it with Liberal or
Orange Lodge agi-
tato r s. Wh a t’s
wrong, for instance,
with Holman get-
ting busy some
evening about
seven o’clock and
sending the entire
Telegraph staff
from the Reverend
Whiskers down-
ward, on board a
vessel bound for
Timbuctoo, and do-
ing it so suddenly
that Watkin Wynne
of Wales wouldn’t
have time to collect his bowls. In fact,
what’s to prevent any Government with a
majority of one deporting the whole Opposi-
tion?
ONE SINNER REPENTS.
The Prime Minister (Mr. Cook) said: “I came
away quite impressed with the idea that the right
thing had been done so far as the tariff was con-
cerned. The contrast in the way these matters used
used to be dealt with in Parliament and the course
taken by the Commission this morning was very
marked. Indeed, the marvel is that the tariff has
been made the football of politicians so long when
a business-like method such as has been now adopted
was possible all the while."
Australia: Yes, and I’m titterly sick of
the way that is made the football of party
politics. ”
. The British Dominions Commission made
one shocking remark in its report. It said
that oversea vessels of 40ft. draught will
soon be the standard, as craft of that size
can negotiate the Panama Canal. And of
the Australasian harbors with cities on them
only Sydney, Hobart, Wellington and Auck-
land can supplv the required accommoda-
tion. The other places, so far as the big
oversea trade is concerned, will have to go
away and bury themselves.
The Sydney Telegraph’s curious inability
to be accurate in details was exemplified by
a leading article of January 30, in which
it said that Dacey was the first Treasurer
of the present N.S.W. Government. If a
paper doesn’t take the trouble to know what
is happening at its door, a. critical reader is
apt to wonder whether its learned disserta-
tion on the prevalence of lions during the
recent hot spell in Greenland is any more
accurate than it ought to be.
The high-handed and grossly illegal
methods adopted by the Botha Government
in South Africa to suppress the recent
strike—they included the deportation of a
dozen strike leaders to England, with very
little clothing and no money worth men-
tioning-—had just one shadow of excuse. In
a country where a handful of white men
is holding the fort against a vast nigger
population, the white population can’t run a
civil war or an industrial war or any other
kind of disturbance without the risk of the
multitudinous son of Ham rising up and
wiping out both parties. It must try to
look united for fear Ham should break loose.
If there were 2,000,000 niggers around Syd-
ney, even a humble wharf strike might en-
courage them to rise up, and set fire to the
town, and embezzle the wives and daughters
of all concerned or unconcerned. An ordin-
ary, well-conducted scrap is one thing; but
quite another thing is a scrap when a huge
and dangerous irresponsible with an axe is
hanging on the outskirts, and wondering
whom he will hit first.
Almost everybody has a turn at the
N.S.W. Treasury under the present Govern-
ment, and the most important billet of them
all seems to be anybody’s dog. McGowen
kept the keys from 21st October, 1910, to
26th November, 1911. Dacey was in office
from 27th November, 1911, to 11th April.
1912, and then death cut short the career
of a very respectable financier. For a few
days the job was nobody’s goods, but Car-
michael carried the responsibility from 17th
April to sth May. He is a man of brains,
but nobody can learn the details of finance
in 18 days. Cann came next, and now Hol-
man follows Cann. Five Treasurers in 31
years.
Cann is now the only remnant of the original
N.S.W. Labor party left in the Ministry.
In the previous Administration there were
thiee remnants —McGowen, Cann and Edden.
McGowen, tired even of missing the ’bus,
dropped out; poor old Alf Edden, who wasn’t
caught young enough, was pushed out. Or
perhaps it might be truer to say that he just
floated out.
When the mail train which brings the
invoice for the imported goods to Sydney is
10 minutes or three hours late, the city is
thrown into confusion, the clock of com-
merce stands still, and the swearing of
excited merchants blisters Parkes’s graven
images at the G.P.O. Wherefore Prime
Minister Cook, on behalf of commerce, com-
plained to the N.S.W. State Gov-
ernment and presented a list of re-
cent late train-arrivals. The
N.S.W. State Government replied
with another document alleging
that the mail train was often late
at Albury, and it demanded to know
how N.S.W. could be held respon-
sible for Victorian derelictions.
Apparently the matter ends there,
and commerce will simply go on
being excited. There is an argu-
ment lying around somewhere in
favor of the Federal control of the
Australian railways which carry
the mails for the Australian postal
department; but Commerce, which
is mostly Tory and State Frights,
can’t be expected to see it.
“Gerald Barker” thinks he sees the
Beef Octopus:—
The Union Cold Storage Co., alleged to be an
English firm, has bought the pastoral interests con-
trolled by Copley Bros, and Patterson, and also those
of the late W. F. Buchanan, all in the nor’-west of
Westralia. The Copleys have sold the Ord River,
Sturt Creek and Margaret River stations, on which are
running about 140,000 head of cattle. If this isn’t the
• Yankee Octopus it looks like a very good imitation.
Still, even if it isn’t the Yankee Trust, it is pretty
plainly some other kind of Trust; and I don’t know
whether it is any pleasanter to be squeezed by an
octopus branded “J. 8.” on the near shoulder than
by one marked “U.S.” on the off rump.
Premier Watt is already experiencing
trouble with the “Liberal Corner,” and has
had to drop most of his proposed measures
for his summer session, Robertson, Farrer.
Nawman Bayles and others having objected
to so many Bills being listed. They are
obviously of opinion that steady work in
. return for salary is infra dig. or something.
However, when the House was later on
asked to approve Watt’s action in paying
£lO,OOO for some private land in South Mel-
bourne without authority, the Corner was
as docile as it always is when Government
land deals are to be approved. This land
was supposed to be wanted for the new Mel-
bourne markets ; but now the Railway Com-
missioners say they can’t build a line thereto,
and Watt isn’t sure whether the market is
wanted, or whether he ought to provide it if
it is. So the State holds £lO,OOO worth of
land about which the public doesn’t know
enough -to say whether the deal was square
or a plain take-down.
THE POTENTATE.
[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
While the common people are contending in a
frenzied rabble for the right to travel in dog-boxes,
the Victorian Railway Commissioners are ushered
with portentous ceremony by obsequious officials into
spacious cars, upholstered with luxurious magnifi-
cence. Now, we do not grudge the Commissioners
the superior comforts they accord themselves. But
as they are great, so we would ask them to be
merciful, and incline their gracious ears to hear the
anguished outcries of the herd.— Melbourne Age.
A crumpled pasteboard in his hand,
His decent cady crumpled, too,
The wild horde flung him out, to land
Upon his funnybone, and blue
The atmosphere with warm remarks
Concerning concentrated narks.
His flashing eye with anger bright,
His well-pressed trousers dimmed with dust,
He cursed the luck which caused his quite
New braces rudely to be bust,
And rose up roundly to condemn
The common herd which busted them.
He rose up on his frenzied knees,
And rested there in wrath awhile,
And glumly reached around to seize
His hat, while on the seething pile
Of citizens yet more were heaped—
When, on a sudden, up he leaped!
He sprang up from his knees, and cheered,
And waved his hat like anything
(Acting as though he were embeered,
Or found some cause for mafficking),
And followed one who went in state
Unchallenged through the ticket-gate.
To left and right there opened out
An avenue of bowing blokes
Before a Personage. About
That Presence crowds of humble folks
Hovered, with various travelling-traps,
Footwarmers, bottles, gamps and wraps.
A hundred passengers beheld
The battered one leap up, and bray:
“Hooray!—oh, hi!” the blighter yelled,
“The Chief Commissioner! HOORAY!”
(At this a hundred heads were bare.)
“And I— l helped to put him there !”

A COLEDALE MINER
FOUND DR. MORSE’S INDIAN ROOT
PILLS A SPLENDID REMEDY FOR
MUSCULAR RHEUMATISM.
“Rheumatism is a very common ailment
amongst miners, owing to their calling often
requiring them to work in a stooping atti-
tude in dark, damp places. Mr. Herbert
Jenkins, of Coledale, a coal miner at South
Clifton Colliery, N.S.W., relates in the fol-
lowing statement how he was attacked with
this painful complaint, which doubled him
up for about 18 months, and in spite of
medical treatment was unable to. obtain re-
lief. Finally a .friend induced him to take
Dr. Morse’s Indian Root Pills, with the
result that within two weeks he was com-
pletely relieved and able to resume work.
“Being a sufferer,” writes Mr. Herbert
Jenkins, “from muscular rheumatism for a
period of 18 months, and frequently doubled
up with a bad leg and stooping form, I sub-
mitted my malady to a local doctor, who
considered my case a bad one. I com-
menced to despair of ever recovering my
old - form of robust health again. Being a
young married man with wife and family-
the necessities of work as a miner compelled
me to get well as soon as possible, so
I was induced by a friend to try Dr. Morse s
Indian Root Pills, and after a course or
your medicine for a period of two weeks 1
was enabled to return to the colliery at
South Clifton. I now recommend Indian
Root Pills to mv own friends and acquaint-
ances, feeling sure they effected a speedy
cure in my case.”*

NOTIONS
Announced that all arrangements for the
sculling- match between James Paddon, of Australia,
and Ernest Barry, of England, have been com-
pleted. Paddon has received, signed and sent back
the articles, and is expected to leave Australia with
a party, including his backer, Maorilander Seifert, of
Palmerston North, in the Mooltan on May 2.
The Australian Swimming Championships,
commenced in Brisbane (Q.) a week before, were con-
tinued at the Domain Baths (Sydney, N.S.W.) on
Saturday. This is a device which puts the competitors
to a lot of travelling between races, and is calculated
to impair their condition. At Brisbane, Long-worth
was not nearly so brilliant as he has been, and
Cecil Healy had failed utterly to justify the faith
put in him on account of his splendid dash in the
220-Yards State Championship on January 10, when
he almost burst Longworth’s boiler. On that occa-
sion Long-worth traversed the distance in 2min.
ill l-ssec., which was dead slow compared to the
2min. 28 2-ssec. put up by both the late Kieran
and little Beaurepaire, and was a creep compared
with the dashing 2min. 27 2-ssec., established by
himself in the Domain Baths on January 13, 1912.
So when he came out on Saturday last to defend his
title in the 220-vards. Australian Championship
there were prophets who said Healy would beat him,
and also spoke darkly re a certain Victorian young
swimmer named Steadman, who had done mighty
things during his Sydney training. Longworth,
Steadman and Healy struck the water simultaneously,
and rose together. In a few seconds they had estab-
lished a slight lead on the bunch, and then Long-
worth began to slip away. At 30yds. he had a
distinct lead, and Steadman and Healy were swim-
ming cheek-by-jowl. Longworth’s pace continued
to increase, and at the turn he was a good 4yds. to
the front, and Healy had headed Steadman. With
100yds. to go, Healy unwound his sprint, and leaving
Steadman right behind, boldly went after Long-
worth’s scalp. But Longworth fled in haste with
his scalp on his head, and won easily by 7yds. Healy
was about the same distance ahead of Page (N.S.W.),
who had displaced Steadman. There were seven
starters, N.S.W., - Queensland, Victoria and Wes-
tralia all being represented. Longworth’s showing
was a great surprise, as he not only finished in good
fettle, but he had actually got over the distance in
2min. 29 2-ssee.—a wonderful time for the Long-
worth of to-day.
The 100 Yards Australian Breast Stroke Cham-
pionship brought out only three competitors. The
holder of the title is, or was, W. Finney, of
Victoria. The record is held by A. F. Wickham,
who, at Sydney in 1911, won it in lmin. 13 2-ssec.
But Wickham is now a pro., and could not defend
his record. However, it was in no danger. Finney
had been beaten at Brisbane by Finlay, of Westralia,
in the 220 Yards, and it was expected that he
would turn the tables. He never had a hope from
start to finish. Finlay held him the whole time, and
made a pacemaker of him, till the hour was ripe.
Then he quietly glode to the front, and beat the
ex-champion by two-fifths of a second. Rodway,
of Tasmania, finished close up third. There were
other events, but none of them important.
When sometime ago Charles Relpli
journeyed with the speed motor-boat Meteor 11.
(sometime Kangaroo) to Melbourne to race for the
Griffith Challenge Trophy and speed supremacy of
the continent, the event ended in something like a
fiasco. Nautilus 11., the Victorian representative,
the property of the Cornwell Bros., was unable to
conclude the series of races, and Meteor won by
default. On Saturday last the Messrs. Cornwell and
their boat were in Sydney, to wipe but the memory
of that failure. The race took place over the course
that extends from Rose Bay to Manly and back ; it
begins and ends opposite the elegant club house of
the Sydney motor-boat men. The distance is 19
miles, and the conditions were best two out of
three. The Nautilus 11. is fitted with a 120-h.p.
engine and Kangaroo with one of 90-h.p. There
was a third boat on- hand, the N.S.W., fitted with a
150-h.p. engine, and owned by Charlie Moseley and
A. G. James. It started in the first and third heats,
but owing to engine troubles had to retire on both
occasions. Charles Relph being down with
pleurisy, the running of Meteor 11. was handed to
George Robertson and 11. Black. They ran her so
well that in the first heat, despite a splendid start
by Nautilus 11., the N.S.W. boat won with 36sec.
to spare. When the time came to start the second
heat, ‘Meteor’s - engine was oh strike—it was Mel-
bourne over again, with the N.S.W. boat in the
soup this time. Nautilus 11. gave 20min. grace—Mr.
Cornwell wanted to wait longer, but the club
demurred, so the pistol was fired, and as Nautilus
alone responded to it, she was recalled, and given
the heat by default. With difficulty the Meteor was
started for the third heat, but ran hideously for the
first four miles, and Nautilus piled up a big lead.
Towards the finish the Meteor engine suddenly recov-
ered its temper, and responding to persuasion, ran
91 miles in Ifimin. equal to about 33 miles
an hour. But the spurt came too late, and
Nautilus won with lmin. 55sec. to spare. There is
no doubt that when its engine feels that way, the
Meteor is a faster boat than the Nautilus —but on
Saturday the engine was cantankerous, so the speed
supremacy and the Griffith Shield both go to Vic-
toria for 12 months. Under the name Kangaroo the
Meteor won the championship in ’ll, ’l2 and ’l3.
This is the first time N.S.W. has lost it.
Prime Minister Cook’s splashing of
money to the riflemen has roused the cupidity of
other sports. Last week, at a banquet given to some
visiting yachtsmen at Brisbane, it was suggested that
Cook be waylaid for some boodle for an aquatic car-
nival. If he is wise he will swear off all donations
to all sorts of games. Otherwise the Federal Treasury
will one day be besieged by the Liver Push wanting
a trifle of public money towards the dog-fight.

Victoria came out on top at the Aus-
tralasian Amateur Athletic Championships,! which
were finished at the Amateur Sports Ground, Mel-
bourne, last week. Victoria scored six points to the
Ma State’s five. Maoriland, S.A. and Queensland
managed to record something on the board; but
little Tassy had not a single jot. At the opening of
the meeting the knowing Cabbage Staters anticipated
that the absence of Davis, Ellis and Viogh would
settle their hash, but Victoria gained the day with
some cracks up its sleeve, so to speak. Parker, the
Yankee sprinter, cleaned up the 100. 220 and 440
yards in good, solid style, but lacked the brilliance
of a Nigel Barker.
“M.P.A.”: Parker, the American sprinter,
reproduced his Australasian championships form in a
three-distance match against Joe Burton (Vic.) and
Bradley (N.S.W.) on the Melbourne Cricket Ground
last Saturday. Parker covered the 50yds. in 5 3-5
secs., and the 75yds. in 7 4-ssec., and burst a State
record in each case. He also won the 100yds. in
even time. In the 50yds. Parker got the decision from
Burton by two inches, and in the 100yds. Burton again
missed the ’bus by a full yard. In the 75yds. Parker
had his men well settled, and Bradley turned the
tables on Burton for second place. The Vic. sprinter
broke down just on the tape. Starter Phil Shap-
pere invariably fires his gun while commanding the
field from the front. There is only one infallible
method of starting sprinters, and that is from
directly behind the men. In each heat or event the
actual firing of the pistol should be timed differently,
otherwise experienced peds will anticipate the start.
At this game Arthur Duffey, the Yankee, who'came to
Australia with Alfred Shrubb, was a past master.
And Parker is no slouch at getting off the mark
either. Fraser, the Sydney hurdler, beat Rick Tem-
pleton in the match race over 120yds. in 16 2-ssec.
Fraser isn’t any great gun of a hurdler, but Tem-
pleton clouted the third jump. The jumps on the
M.C.C. are as solid as the stone wall at Flemington,
so a hurdler cannot afford to hit a stick. J. A.
Power, the Yankee middle-distance ped., got a third
from scratch in the half-mile handicap. He put in
a strong finish, but the limit men were too far
ahead. Power seems to be better at a mile. Lester
Kelly and Templeton (U.S.A.) tried some record
high-jumping, but immediately the bar was raised
over 6ft. they failed. Oaughey and Templeton gave
an exhibition of javelin-throwing—a caper of the
ancient Greeks and other people. Caughey did 137 ft.,
and pipped Templeton by 9in. Javelin-throwing is
really hurling a heavy spear. There ought to be a
few aboriginals knocking about Northern Queens-
land and W.A. who could lick creation at it.
Finally, Oaughey and a local Swede (a member of
the Carlton harriers) did some discus-throwing. The
Yanks will perform again next Saturday, and then
pack for Sydney.
The Prince Alfred Yachting Club’s annual
tussle for the Basin Cup took place on Saturday
over the usual course from Sydney to Broken Bay
and back. The wind was light from E.N.E., and
a thick haze draped the ocean and thus prevented
the people on the following steamer seeing anything
of the race. Writer is informed on the worst
authority that it was not missed, owing to a
thoughtful secretary having made ample provision for
passing the time. However, it fell out that
Rawhiti won the Cup, with Culwulla 111. and Sayo-
nara second and third respectively. The open boat
sailing of the Sydney Flying Squadron was pic-
turesque, the display of kite-flying necessitated by
the light wind being very beautiful. The first heat
went to Nimrod, which managed to catch a few
extra cat’s-paws, and beat Arline and Livonia in
that order. In the second heat Degan’s Lilian found
a day which suited her right down to the water, and
she walked the glassy brine a thing of beauty in
snowy white, and left them all behind, with Sunny
South and Pastime leading the bunch in that order.
In the final, the same graceful creation gave nothing
else a chance, and floated home with Pastime and
Enid in pursuit.
Summer baseball did not supply Sydney
with any wild excitement on Saturday. Waverley
Red Sox came up against the Blue Sox, and forgot
to bring a decent battery, with the result that Blue
Sox administered a well-deserved castigation by 16
to nine. As for the match between Leichhardt and
Petersham, it was a walk-over for the former, who
leaped out with 20 to six.
Victoria’s pennant cricketers ran through
their seventh round on Foundation Day and the
Saturday previous; and as the heavens opened on
the intervening Sunday and flooded most of the
grounds, the team that got first turn at the wickets
had the argument almost to itself. South closed
when it had collected 216 for six wickets, against
Essendon’s 71, and dashed after the three-point win;
but it lacked bowling capacity, and the Dons had
lost only four wickets for 81 at the close of the
day. Saints scored 246 for seven wickets off
’Wood’s bowling, and then declared; but the Mag-
pies’ stonewall, though it yielded only 44 for four
wickets, was sufficient to gain the draw. North
similarly pushed defeat away by scraping up 119
runs for two wickets against Carlton’s 255. East,
after compiling 243, polished off P’ran for 88, and
nearlv repeated the performance by getting eight
of its second innings wickets for 83. ’Roy
slammed up 263 for nine wickets on the Saturday,
and then closed; but its hopes were destroyed, for
as the ground was a morass on Monday, there was
then no play, which was probably lucky for
Richmond.

When the Maoriland Cricket Team went
back from Australia it took with it Piki, the clever
little halfback of the last M.L. Maori toeball team.
Since last winter this plucky midget had been lying
in Prince Alfred Hospital (Sydney) with a broken
leg. The smash occurred when Piki was playing in
Sydney, and for 23 weary weeks it kept him in a
hospital bed. The fracture was very obstinate, the
bone being badly splintered ; but Piki is at last able
to hobble about on crutches, so the M.L. cricketers
took him home. He was longing for a glimpse of
the Great Loan Land, and hopes soon to be right
again, although his football days are over.
The Ma State’s scrunching of Victoria, by
an innings and 32 runs, at Svdney Cricket Ground
last week, put an end to the Sheffield Shield troubles
for another season, and left N.S.W. in possession
of the utensil and the cricket championship. The
defeat by S.A. in the opening match apparently got
Ma’s back up, with the result that in the remaining
matches Victoria fell by an innings and 59 runs at
Melbourne and an innings and 32 runs at Sydney;
while S.A. went to splinters with a nine-wicket
defeat on its own woodheap. This is how the three
States fared:—
N.S.W. played four, won three and lost one.
Victoria played three, won one and lost two.
S. Aus. played three, won one and lost two.
Victoria and South Australia have yet to meet, but
the result cannot alter the destination of the Shield.
The Sheffield Shield was presented in 1892-3, and in
the battles since that remote dead date Ma has mono-
polised the glory with 13 wins against six by
Victoria, and three by South Australia —a very one-
sided business.

E. R. Mayne supplied the sparkle in Ade-
laide (S.A.) cricket last Saturday by biffing together
254 not out in East Torrens’s tally of 460 for seven
wickets. Clutterbuck also glimmered or shimmered
when, in a first appearance, he slew six West Torrens
batsmen for 39 runs. What’ll he be like when he
grows up ?
The eighth round of Sydney First-Grade
Cricket (commenced a fortnight ago) concluded on
Saturday last under conditions that were quite
bevel-edged. It was a day of triumph for the bat,
of darkness and despair for the ball. H. Cranney
and F. M. Farrar, of Central Cumberland and Uni-
versity respectively, were the boss sloggers of the
afternoon, each of them lifting 117 on to the scoring-
board, which sagged under a total of five centuries.
Next on the roll of fame was T. J. E. Andrews, of
Petersham, who carried his timber for 113; G. S.
Moore, of North Sydney, who biffed 111 ; and F. B.
Anderson, who smote 100 for Middle Harbor. In
the face of this terrific demonstration one would
naturally expect the bowling figures to look ghastly.
But they didn’t, not by a long chalk. Little Macart-
ney, Gordon’s cherub, took eight wickets for 101,
and the same T. J. E. Andrews knocked down six
West Sydney sticks for 131 ; Kelleway, of the Glebe,
got five Redfern wickets for 24; and Massie, of
Uni., laid low five Balmain batsmen for 40. Glebe
strove hard to score a full-point win over the
fainting Redfern. With an advantage of 18 runs
on the first innings, Glebe hurriedly bounced up
203 for the loss of six wickets. Then it declared
and howled to Redfern to go in and get killed. But
Redfern hung on to life very hard, and when the
sun went down upon its wrath it had lost only six
wickets for 93 —so Glebe had to be content with
the first-innings win by 18. Sydney, having abol-
ished Waverley for 271, threw up 364, and so won
on the first innings by 93. University, which had
smashed Balmain for 242, went to the sticks, and
in two hours belted 362 for the loss of four wickets,
and declared. The principal performers were Farrar
(117), Tozer (98) and Barbour (73). Balmain
began to go to pieces, and the barrackers ceased
shouting and prayed earnestly for two good men to
hold the bridge. They turned up in Love and
Jones, 60 and 24 respectively, and the time spent in
killing them off lost the full-point win, so. Uni. had
to be content with a first-innings victory by 120
runs. North Sydney answered Gordon’s 231 with
249, and so won a first-innings victory by 18 runs.
Petersham had a disappointing experience. It fell
for 192 in the first innings, and then Western
Suburbs put it all over it for 304. Petersham went
back to the sticks, and with the aid of Andrews’s
113, knocked up 237 for the loss of one wicket.
But the upheaval came too late —the game was
decided on the first innings, and Petersham was
dead and buried and embalmed by 112 runs. Central
Cumberland, with 115 and 230 for five wickets,
annexed the scalp of Middle Harbor (127 and 210)
by five wickets and eight runs.
Though somewhat austere, Governor
Bosanquet has nevertheless been a regular patron of
racing during his five years in South Aus., and he
solemnly handed one to the Wowsers when being
farewelled by the Adelaide Racing Club on Founda-
tion Day: “One of the greatest charms of life here
is to be found in the fine, manly sports and pastimes
which exercise an important influence upon the for-
mation of the national character. Of these sports
racing is one of the most interesting, and I am
sure that when properly carried out the sport is
productive of beneficial results. (Cheers.) I
think that it is a mistake to discourage such plea-
sures because they may possibly lead to abuses and
excesses. People must have recreation and amuse-
ment ; and it is better to join and sympathise with
them genially and heartily, and do what you can
to make them go off with moderation and propriety,
than to spend one’s time preaching against them as
disreputable and demoralising.” (Loud cheers.)

Weights for the Newmarket Handicap
and Australian Cup are not too rough on the top-
notchers. In the 6-furlong flutter only 29 entrants
are placed above the Bst. mark, whilst 85 are let in
at from 6st. 71b. to 7st. 131 b. Gigandra heads the
list with 9st. 131 b., the same burden that he bore
1 last year when he fell. The imported horses, Valido
(Bst. 111 b.), Audacity (Bst. 71b.), and Carnell
(7st. 81b.) are kindly treated on their best per-
formances, and the talked-of Rathlea, as a 4-year-old,
has only the same weight (7st. 121 b.) which was
dealt out to him last year. But it is too early in
the month to form a strong fancy for anything for
a sprint that is dated the 28th.
The Australian Cup, like the Newmarket,
is worth £2lOO to the winner, and should draw a
fair-sized field, although there are but 57 entrants,
and fully 50 per cent, of them have no visible pre-
tensions to last 2J miles. The Parisian (9st.) and
Audacity (Bst. 51b.) strike one as being favorably
handicapped, but, seeing that both of them went
amiss before the Melbourne Cup, punters will want
to see them at the post before they feel sure of a
run for their money. Meanwhile it is worth noting
that only two winners in the last 14 years have
carried more than Bst.
A lovely condition of blackguardism pre-
vails among the mannikins who guide the destinies
of racehorses in Victoria. The other day four of
the leading “knights of the pigskin,” as horse re-
porters term them (not a bad description if the skin
is understood to be their own) amused themselves
by making a joint onslaught upon a stout, elderly
cit. who was standing outside a pub at Caulfield
talking to a friend. The little imps knew nothing
of the man. He happened to be the first person they
saw on alighting from the motor-car which had
brought them from a race-meeting or a dogfight.
Not a word was spoken before the astonished victim
was knocked down and battered by the merry party.
Two or three of his teeth were knocked out. His
friend went to his assistance, and was treated in like
manner. Two or three of his teeth left tneir moor-
ings. The pigskin knights had a leading spirit
among them, of course —a “fashionable lightweight,’*
who fancies himself as a bruiser. But they were
all in it, and would all have been convicted of a
brutal, unprovoked assault if the damaged stout
person had not let himself be talked into “squaring”
the case. The four blackguards coughed up consider-
ably more than £lOO in all to keep their escapade
out of court. If the V.R.C. Committee takes any
interest in the decency, or otherwise, of these licensed
lords of the turf, something should result from this
exposure. Possibly the committee, after hearing
evidence, will find the quartette guilty of “sus-
picious practices,” and warn them not to do it again.

The man who carries the bag had a royal
time at Rosehill (Sydney) Races on Saturday. In
six events three of the winning prads started at
10’s —which means mighty little backing; one at
12’s; another at 20’s; and the other at any old
price. Still, no one agitates very much for the
Tote. Of course, the bookie can pay people out of
his own pocket not to advocate the Tote, and the
• Tote, not having a pocket, can’t pay people to leave
off advocating the bookie.

The much-argued question of whether
swimmer Beaurepaire is a professional because he
has a job under the State as swimming instructor is
on its legs again. The Victorian body alleges he is
not. The Australian body avers he is; and will refer
the matter to the International Amateur Federa-
tion, which is to be in congress assembled at Buda-
pest in May next. It’s an awful distance to send a
kitchen squabble.
“Bilroc,” from London: In the recent
collision at Paris between the two brethren of the
dusky tribe of Johnson, Jack of that ilk, lost his
famous gold-tipped smile, and came within an ace
of losing the world’s championship with it. The
two eullud brudders, each offering a lavish display
of teeth, eyeballs and shining mahogany hide, entered
the ring with all the bombastic arrogance of the
African nig. when pushed into a place of much
prominence. Jack was more jaunty than Jim.
Apparently he expected an easy victory. His grin
could scarcely have been spanned with a foot-rule.
He swapped light-hearted badinage with his seconds.
He joshed the shirt-fronted haute monde that formed
the bulk of the audience. He smirked, he bowed,
he grimaced. He was supreme. He was It. He did
everything but fight. The first four or five rounds
produced nothing but a fanciful display of skirmish-
ing at long range. As an exhibition of shadow-
pantomime it was magnificent, , but it was .not biff.
And the well-dressed French audience knew it, and
announced the fact in an outburst of ejaculations
Francois, which, being interpreted into plain Aus-
tralianese, meant “Get into it, you black cows!”
“Yah!” “Loafers!” etc. Jack was the worst
offender. He toiled not, neither did he punch. Stung
by the voice of the crowd, James woke up, and ex-
tended the glad hand, and extended it so hard and
often that Jack’s head rocked ominously. Moreover,
he showed signs of a shortage of wind. In a des-
pairing effort the great Jack unloosed a small
hurricane of stoush, but the said hurricane proved to
be nothing but a spring zephyr, mild and without
stifig. With impending disaster before his eyes, it
dawned upon John that he was up against it.
Visions of vanishing Fame smote him between the
headlights, while Jim’s consistent left caught him
in the midriff. Slowly and sadly the famous grin
faded. In its place came an expression ludicrously
tragic. The portly Jim hurled derision at the
Champ Nig., presenting his face to him for damage.
Time and again Jack hit, missed and received in
return something that tasted like a kick from a
mule. Only a miracle could save him, and that
miracle came in the form of the Gong, announcing
the end of the fight. The two judges, after the
manner Frangais, handed in their notes. One of them
inclined to a straight verdict for the ebony Jim,
because he had finished in better wind, and had had
the best of a poor bout. The other judge favored a
draw. This view was shared by the referee, whose
casting vote saved for L’il Arthuli the championship
belt.
After the match Jack complained of a severe pain
in the left arm, and a handy medico announced that
the weapon in question “presented a fracture in the
middle forearm.” The blow that caused this
damage, however, only came late in the fight. The
dusky nabob lost the scrap solely through lack of
condition, which only confirms my forecast in a
previous issue that when J. Johnson, Esq., loses the
championshin he will be defeated by his own lazy,
crazy self. Most of his training (!) for this mill was
done at certain dance halls in the Gay Village,
where, it is reported, his Darkness became an adept
exponent of the tango. Meantime, L’il Arthuli,
nursing a broken arm and an injured pride, clings
by the skin of his reputation to the top rung of the
fistic ladder. How long he will retain his grip is a
matter entirely in the lap of the gods.

Someone should take Arthur Evernden,
the English boxer, aside and breathe into his ear*
that to win a fight it is necessary to hit the other
fellow. In his scrap with Johnny Summers, at Syd-
ney Stadium on Saturday night, he apparently forgot
that fact. Whole rounds passed without him attempt-
ing to hit, or when he did attempt he missed.
Summers tintoed round the ring like a young lady
under the tuition of a dancing-master, and in the
great majority of cases was absent when Evernden’s
wallops tore through the atmosphere. If he was
not awav at the seaside or otherwise absent, he re-
ceived the worst of the impact on his gloves. His
ducking and side-stepping were superb—but Evern-
den was so slow that almost anyone but a tortoise
could have dodged most of his assaults. With his
gloves covering his jaws he lumbered or waddled
round the ring, trying to force the fleeting, airy
Johnny into corners or on to the ropes, but when
Summers allowed himself to be worked into the
desired position, Evernden either forgot to hit, or
Johnny forestalled him with a straight left on the
nose, or clinched, or dived to the bottom of the
sea, and came up a mile away. Any scoring that
Evernden did was done at close quarters. Only in
twio rounds of the 20 did he show to advantage. But
he is tough. Summers is a mighty hitter, and he
never hit harder in his life than he did on Saturday
night. With left and right swings, with all his
weight and force behind them, he let go on Evern-
den’s glove-covered face. The gloves protected the
jaws, but not the eyes or nose, and Evernden took
much bombardment. An old wound was opened
oyer his left eye, and a new cut was installed above
his right. Summers knocked him reeling again and
again, but Evernden regarded these powerful bashes
as so much thistledown, covered up his jaws once
more, and again waddled in. Having been outboxed
on two former occasions, Evernden had, apparently,
made up his mind that his only chance was a
knock-out, and he went after it persistently—and
missed it every time. His nearest approach to his
goal was in the 17th, when he staggered humanity
by suddenly letting go a fearsome uppercut for the
first time in the fight. Summers saw it coming,
and hurled his head and body backwards, so that
the glove just grazed his chin. It was a narrow
escape. Altogether Evernden was as labored in his
boxing as Wade is in his politics. Summers’ coun-
tering was superb, and again and' again he arrived
with deadly effect. But a sledgehammer couldn’t
knock Evernden, and with his splendid stamina, his
ironclad jaw, his determination, he requires only
speed to be a world-beater. And speed he has not
got. At the end there was only one possible verdict,
and when Scott placed his hand on Summers’ saintly
halo, Evernden opened his mighty arms, embraced
his late opponent, and imprinted a loud kiss on
Johnny’s hard, furrowed countenance. It was a
weird scene.
The all-conquering motor. At back-blox
race meetings in 'Maoriland it is now quite common
to see a couple of horses arrive in a covered-in motor-
waggon. The big Maoriland Express .Co. has numer-
ous motors that can be fitted up for this work, and
owners competing at out-of-the way meetings find
that they can get their prads to the course and home
again quicker, and in better trim, by this modern
means than any other. The horses don’t seem to
mind it in the least.
During 1913 Maorilander Wilding won
the World’s Grass-Court Tennis Championship at
Wimbleton, the World’s Hard-Court Championship at
Paris, and the World’s Covered-Court Championship
at Stockholm. No other player has ever annexed
the triple title in the same year. In the three con-
tests Wilding lost only four sets —all, strange to say,
to French players. McLoughlin couldn’t win a set
against him at Wimbledon ; but at Paris, where the
champion had to “play through,” Decugis won two
sets and Gobert one. At Stockholm, where Wilding
also “played through,” he lost one set to
Germot, in the final. If any tennis plaver ever really
deserved the title of Champion of the World, Anthony
Wilding seems to be the man.

that you need is elbow room.
Under such favorable conditions progress
is naturally rapid and good results per-
manently secured.
See how these men have benefited: —
‘‘l am pleased to report I am fretting on splen-
didly, and am feeling better in everv wav. since I
started your Course.”-A).H., Dunedin, N.Z.
“I have now finished my second month’s course, and
can say that I never felt better. Nothing pleases
me more than going through your exercises. Mv
chest is 36 inches, as against 33* when 1 started, and
I have put on 81b. in weight.”
E.M., Gunnedah, N.S.W.
“I must say I have improved wonderfully in health
and spirits since starting your Course. I have
gained nearly half a stone in weight, and I feel
better than ever.” —T.J.H., Tolga, Q.

The Women’s Corner
SPECIAL COLLECTION OF SMART
AND EFFECTIVE REALTY
RECIPES.
Permanently Removing
Superfluous Hair.
“TOILET GOSSIP.”' - '
How to permanently, not merely temporarily, re-
move a downy growth of disfiguri :.g. super luous
hair is what many women wish t »t.- w. It is
a pity that it is not more generally . own that
pure, powdered pheminol, obtainable irom the
chemists, may be used for this purpose. It is
applied directly to the objectionable hair. The
recommended treatment not only instantly removes
the hair, leaving no trace, but is designed also to
kill the roots completely. * * * The natural allacite
of orange blossoms makes a capital greaseless face
cream. It holds the powder perfectly, and the
natural odor of this product is, of course, most
delightful. Many of the smartest women are now
using it exclusively, because it does not encourage
a growth of hair on the face. * * * The annoying
body odor sometimes resulting from perspiration can
be instantly neutralised by the occasional application
of powdered (white) pergol.
A Strange Shampoo.
“cosy corner chats.”
* * * I was much interested to learn from this
young woman with the beautiful glossy hair that
she never washes it with soap or artificial shampoo
powders. Instead, she makes her own shampoo by
dissolving a teaspoonful of stallax granules in a
cup of hot water. “I make my chemist get the
stallax for me,” said she. “It comes only in sealed
packages, enough to make up 25 or 30 individual
shampoos, and it smells so good I could almost cat
it.” Certainly this little lady's hair did look wonder-
ful, even if she has strange ideas of a shampoo. I
am tempted to try the plan myself. * * * For an
actual hair-grower nothing equals pure boranium.
It is quite harmless, and sets the hair roots tingling
with new life. * * * The use of rouge is almost
always obvious, but powdered colliandum gives a
perfectly natural color and defies detection.
Renewing Complexions ,
with Oxygen.
“handy recipes.”
Everyone knows that oxygen consumes waste
matter in the body. A poor complexion is merely
the accumulation of half deadened or waste matter
upon the surface of the skin. It sticks on stubbornly,
showing in the form of sallowness, moth patches
and a generally lifeless appearance. Oxygen may
be used with advantage in removing this disfigura-
tion. Any chemist should be able to supply mercol-
ized wax. This contains oxygen in a form that is
released when it comes in contact with the skin.
Naturally the oxygen attacks the deadened matter
but does not affect the healthy skin at all. Thus a
few applications of this perfectly harmless substance
soon begins to clear the skin and reveal the beautiful
complexion which every woman has just underneath
the ugly one. The process is pleasant and harmless,
and involves no inconvenience whatever. * * * To
bring a natural red color to the lips, rub them
with a soft stick of prolactum. * * * For hot, tired
or perspiring feet, use a teaspoonful of powdered
onalite in a foot bath.
What Women Hate.
“helpful gossip.”
Every woman hates a shim' nose and a dull or
greasy complexion. Few know, that there is an
instantaneous remedy at hand in the home, one
that is absolutely harmless, and that defies detection
even under the closest scrutiny. If you have no
cleminite in the house get about an ounce from your
chemist, and add just sufficient water to dissolve it.
A little of this lotion anplied to the face will in-
stantly cause the greasiness to disappear, and the
skin will have a perfectly natural, velvety, youthful
bloom that any woman might envy. The effect will
last for many hours, and no powder is required, even
under the most trying conditions, indoors or out.
To prepare the face, neck and arms for a long even-
ing in a hot ballroom, nothing can compare with
this simple home-made lotion. * * * To make the
eyelashes grow long, dark and curling, apply a
little mennaline with the finger-tips occasionally. It
is absolutely harmless, and beautifies the eyebrows
as well. * * * Pilenta soap is the most satisfactory
for all complexions. It even works well in cold or
hard water.

“W.F.M.” on another parson:—
Reference was made in a November Bulletin to
the troublous times through which the Unitarians
of Melbourne were passing, owing to the difficulty in
laying hands on a shepherd for their Eastern Hill
flock,. The par. met the glad eye of Rev. Wyndham
S. Heathcote (pronounce this Hethcote, as you value
your life), who was doing nothing much in Sydney,
after having put in half a dozen years in Bundaberg.
He lost no time in offering his services to the Mel-
bourne Unitarians. They, with Henry Gyles Turner
bossing the proceedings, said with one accord, “Aye,”
when asked if they would accept him as shepherd.
Heathcote is a cousin to Sir John Fuller, but is not
to blame for that. After a good many years’ service
in the Anglican fold he had “doubts,” and quitted.
His politics are so radical that once lie offered him-
self as a candidate for selection as Labor Senator
of Queensland, and was beaten by only a pocketful
of votes. '
“Tom Noddy”: Agricultural Professor
Cherry, of Mclb. University, has just finished
three books dealing with rural conditions in
Victoria and the Ma State. Cherry’s posi-
tion is at present a wild anomaly. Some
18 months ago the Government decided that
there ought to be a Chair of Agriculture at
Melb. University. Being the power behind
the purse, Ministers practically forced the
appointment, although the stodgy University
authorities could not see the desirability of
the innovation. Cherry was thereupon ap-
pointed, and found himself with no depart-
ment of his own to look after, and with no
call to help in any other. He was the only
Professor with no students to lecture —in
fact, he had no specified duties at all.
Philosophically he turned to literary
work; and the three books are the
solid result to date. Apparently the
Government is satisfied; the Professor
doesn’t audibly complain; and the tax-
payer pays and doesn’t grumble, because he
doesn’t know. But, if the thing leaks out,
he may get annoyed.
“Fax” writes : “I have an abiding memory
of the late barrister R. W. Pennefather (who
died in Perth the other week) when he was
practising in Melbourne. I was speaking of
the seeming inequity of a certain legal deci-
sion, and he settled the matter to his satis-
faction by saying, “Nobody knows the
Law.” Ever since then I have thought that
the Law should be sufficiently simplified to
permit of lawyers knowing it. Apparently
they have only the little knowledge which is
a dangerous thing—for their clients.
“H.” strikes a foreign note
Albert MCtin, who, according to the cable, has
just been made Minister for Labor in M. Doumergue’s
new French Cabinet, was in Australia 10 or 12 years
ago. He had won a travelling studentship in the
University of Paris, and came here to study Labor
legislation and the Labor movement generally. Those
were the days when Liberalism regarded Arbitration
as “mad, experimental Socialism,” calculated to
burst up the home and desecrate the marriage tie.
B. R. Wise’s Arbitration Bill had just been thrown
out of the N.S.W. Legislative Council, and Metin
went to stay with Wise at Port Hacking, where I
met him". He was a typical Frenchman of the
intellectual order, eager, quick and intensely receptive
to new ideas. Arbitration and Conciliation appealed
to him then as a principle that would inevitably win
over even the dullards in a little while. He had a
profound admiration for Wise, and booms him to
this day in the Revue des deux Mondes and other
French publications which refer, now and then, to
Australian affairs. M(itin’s wife, who was with him
in Australia, is a relation of Maitre Labori, the
famous advocate who defended Dreyfus.
Died in America lately, Charles Tellier,
French scientist and engineer, and a pioneer
of the frozen-carcase business. He was the
first to ship meat under refrigeration
through the tropics. That was in the ’7o’s,
although as far back as 1859 he had in-
vented an ammonia-absorption refrigerating
plant, and in 1867 an ammonia-compression
plant. Three of Tellier’s refrigerating en-
gines were fitted into the steamer Frigo-
rifique, and some meat was taken to France
from Buenos Ayres. It was pronounced to
have “dark spots” and a rather “unpleasant
flavor.” Other experiments followed, and
very soon it was chronicled that the problem
of refrigeration had been solved. Among
those interested in Tellier’s experiments
were Thomas Mort, who pioneered the freez-
ing business in Australia, and James Harri-
son, formerly editor of the Geelong Adver-
tiser, who was the first Australian to make
a commercial success of the manufacture of
ice. Tellier, like many another scientist,
had no head for business or robbery, and
was an old, hard-up man when he died.
“B.B.” on yet another Tasmanian tomb-
stone :
Of your charitv pray for the soul of the
REVD. PHILIP CONOLLY,
who died the third day of August, 1839,
Aged 53 years.
My days have declined like a shadow and I am
withered like the grass.—Ps. 150-12.
Father Conolly was one of the pioneer
priests of the R.C. Church in Australia; he
arrived in Sydney with Father Therry in
the ship Janus, on May 3, 1820, with a com-
mission to act as R.C. Chaplain in N.S.W.
Father Conolly was the senior priest of the
two, but soon became dissatisfied with the
prospects in Sydney, and, in the following
March decided to take up the work of the
church in Van Diemen’s Land. He was in
Hobart Town till January, 1833, before he
saw a fellow-priest—Father W. B. Ulla-
thorne. who had arrived as Vicar-General in
Australia. Father Conolly was a remark-
able character in the early history of Tas-
mania, and a boon companion of Parson
Bobby Knopwood, the Prodestan chaplain.
Knopwood, besides being a parson, was a
magistrate, and always sentenced Catholic
prisoners to work for Father Conolly.
“Nestor”: One of the saddest sights of
modern times is the decline of the frock
coat and “silk” hat. In my youth (before
you were born, young man) no one who
desired to win the esteem of his fellows and
keep out of the hands of the police and the
Wowsers ever wore anything but a frock
coat and a silk hat. Workmen of the
superior type—members of the more import-
apt Hinglish unions, like the carpenters and
joiners, engineers and stonemasons —always
wore these respectable garments on Sundays.
Probably they would have worn them on
week days if they could have done their
jobs in them. . I remember the S. M.
Herald comps, in the old days, pot-hatted
and frock-coated to a comp., and invariably
regretting that they were not permitted by
a freakish modernity to wear swords,
as they were allowed to do by Act of Par-
liament in ancient times. Nowadays, in an
era of sac suit and soft hat, immigrant caps
and motor-cars, if you meet a friend in a
frock hat and a top coat you wonder which
it is—weddin ■. fur ~il, or has he got a
billet as ash walke: in a rag-shop? Eheu
fugaces, evc~ the Judges !

“His Master’s Voice”
Oak Library Grand No. 2.
This instrument is of rather more
slender proportions than the previous
models, and is better suited for
smaller rooms. It has most of the
.features of the larger models, but con-
tains them, naturally, in a smaller
compass.
The whole of the upper part of the
Cabinet is utilised for the internal
horn —under wjiich is a' record-
chamber to hold 120 records in
albums.
SIZE : Height 43Jin.; width 19^in.;
depth 23fin.
It is a beautiful instrument —-elegant
and chaste in design, and a veritable
triumph in sound-reproduction.
Think just how much prestige, in a
musical sense, the possession of such
an instrument would impart to your
home!

“Hamer”: About the most uncertain job
on earth is that of the union secretary. The
pay, usually, is wretched ; yet there are in
every organisation intriguers with their eye
on the job, and on the least excuse out goes
'the present holder of the dignity on a
snatch vote —if he doesn’t happen to belong
to one of the few organisations which have
made their secretary a permanent officer.
The cause may be that he has compelled tlic
chronic loafers to pay up, or that a strike lie
did not advocate was a failure, or any old
thing. Disaster in the ranks of NiS.W.
union secretaries has been frequent during
the last 12 months or so. Amongst others.
Syd Harrison, of the Wharf Laborers’
Union; Sinclair, secretary of the Boiler-
makers for a generation ; and. at the latest,
Dave Sullivan, who for 24 years was sec-
retary of the Moulders’ Union, have been
passed into the scrap-heap. These men had
practically made their unions; and by their
work on conferences, wages boards and in
other directions had placed their organisa-
tions on a solid basis. Yet down and out
they went when the strings were pulled.
Sinclair’s case was the worst of the lot. He
was not even allowed to] contest the ballot,
his nomination being declared informal be-
cause, by an oversight, he happened to be
threepence in arrears with his contributions.
So a score of years’ service was ended over
a matter of threepence. On the Sydney
experience it is something more than a Tory
gag that Labor Unions make heartless
bosses.
“0.K.” writes
Touching “11. Singemoine’s” assumption that “Ran-
dolph Bedford appears to be afflicted with the com-
mon delusion that vanity is a matter entirely of
taking pride in a handsome appearance, beautiful
clothes, etc.,” I am not concerned with the question
whether Bedford sees something to admire in the
aggressively “simple life” of a Jimmy Tyson and some-
thing to despise in the habits of a decorative John-
nie, fresh from Piccadilly. But I have always been
much interested in my own theory that a “dandy”
appearance and manner are as much-an indication of
a want of personal vanity in the man as a conspicu-
ous untidiness and roughness are an indication of
enormous self-conceit. The expression, “taking a
pride in one’s appearance,” is mostly false, and mis-
leading. A husband may take a pride in the smart l
ness of his handsomely-dressed wife, but his careful
attention to his own outfit is probably due to the
idea that his personality needs all the aid he can
get from the tailor, hosier and hatter. Tyson was
so vain of the financial figure he cut in the world
that he made a point of accentuating it by his dirty,
shabby exterior. The conventional, well-groomed •
citizen, or “bit of, a dandy,” js. .not necessarily pos-
sessed of self-conceit. As a rule, 1 take it, he
esfeems himself so little that he wants ’ the tailor to
make something of him. He puts the best possible
appearance on himself by way of expressing his
anesthetic sense of duty to society. Hat in - hand, he
pavs his humble respects to civilisation, and hopes he
will suit. He gratefully 'accepts favorable notice
from women or men, but he certainly'‘does not, as
a rule, demand attention with the confidence of the
ordinary pushful,, red-faced, bull-necked commercial
traveller, or other person of self-importance, who
takes no particular pains with his dressing. The
fullest expression of vanity is audacity. An audacious
man is the antithesis of the typical Johnnie of melo-
drama. Close up with the man of abnormal “cheek”
comes the “self-made man,” who advertises his con-
tempt for the conventionalities. It is his way of’
stating that he reckons he has risen superior to the
considerations which rule meaner mortals. Tyson’s
vanity was that of the ordinary self-made man in an
exaggerated form. Every aggressive assertion’ of'
“individuality” in dress and manners, from King
O’Malley’s hat downwards, is an expression of vanity,
and, in many cases,, a puerile expression. Now, in
the decorative get-up of the ordinary dressy man
there is. absolutely no assertion of individuality. His
endeavor is to be clothed seasonably, in the best
taste he can afford to indulge. He subordinates-him-
self to his garments, whilst doing his little best to
look dess ugly .than the Tysons of this world. And
he remains conscious of. thie fact, . that his young
sister is doing her little best in a more satisfactory
manner. You cannot call the modern well-dressed
man a vain person as though he were a Beau Brum-.
mel. He dresses to please the. world’s eye, but he is
not striving to become notorious. On the other
hand,-an absurdly dirty, shabby, uncouth millionaire
is consciously bidding for notoriety all. the time. lie
is the truly vain thing.
Little, brother Snowball, grandmaster of
the Orange lodges of Vic., said at a lodge
“swarry” lately:—
In Great Britain Orangemen were standing shoul-
der to shoulder in opposition to Home Rule. They
knew what Home Rule meant— ; the break-up of the
British Empire—and Australian and Victorian blood*
would be shed to assist in upholding British liber-
ties. Australian money had been sent to Sir Ed-
ward Carson, and Australian men would also go
if need be.
Brother Snowball further desired to shed
his own blood as well as the blood of per-
fect strangers in the noble cause. What is
the poison that works in the minds of nice,
inoffensive.little chaps like Snowball? The
“brother” is a little man who seeks,to add a
cubit to his stature with a black stovepipe:
hat and a frock coat; he takes about a 13 £-
‘ inch collar and wouldn’t kill a fly. Yet on
“loyal” occasions he can foam at the mouth
with , the worst of them. The only shadow
on his reputation for inoffensiveness is the
rumor that he once lost his temper and
struck a beetle’; but it is pleaded in extenua-
tion that the beetle struck him first.
“J. 0.8.”: AJI the ecclesiastical millinery
is given a sunning nowadays at the January
anniversary of the “first church service held
in Australia”—in Macquarie Place,. Sydney.
But .“the Methodist person named Johnson”
didn’t get much official encouragement when
he proceeded tb give out the opening hymn.
Neither Phillip nor Grose cheered him when
he got under the shade of a tree and pro-
ceeded to do 'his pioneering. He was in-
dentured to the Government at 10s. a day
and rations, which was more than he was
worth, the Governor thought. After moving
from tree to thee, Johnson got the use of a
boatshed-—the water at that time ran up to
Bridge-street when the tide was in. Con-
trary to common opinion, Parramatta pre-
ceded Sydney in the effort to build a church ;
but when the walls had been run up and the
place was habitable, the Governor ordered it
to be turned into a lockup. Later he made
it a public granary in his efforts to oust
speculative middlemen. During the whole
period of Phillip’s governorship there was
no building set apart for church service.
Johnson had therefore to dodge about. The
means to build the wattle-and-daub structure
at the junction of Phillip and Hunter
streets came ,out of his own pocket, and
represented the savings from his 10s. a day;
but he managed to get paid back. - Grose,
the Lieutenant-Governor, ordered him to
start his church service at 6 a.m.' and to get
through it in three-quarters of an hour; and
on at least one occasion the tattoo sounded
before the preacher had finished, and the
congregation never heard the last of that
pious exhortation.

ACID STOMACHS ARE DANGEROUS.
NINE-TENTHS OF ALL STOMACH
TROUBLE SAID TO BE DUE TO
ACIDITY.
A PHYSICIAN’S ADVICE ON CAUSE
AND CURE.
A famous physician, whose successful re-
searches into the cause and cure of stomach
and intestinal diseases have earned for him
an international reputation, said in the
course of a recent lecture that nearly all
intestinal troubles, as well as many diseases
of the vital organs, were directly traceable
to a deranged condition of the stomach,
which in turn was due nine times out of ten
to excessive acidity, which not only irritated
and inflamed the delicate lining of the
stomach, but also set up gastritis and
stomach ulcers. It is interesting to' note
that he condemns the use of patent medicines
as well 'as of medical treatment for the
stomach, stating that he and his colleagues
have secured remarkable results by the use
of ordinary bisurated magnesia, which, by
neutralising the acidity of the food, removes
the source of the trouble. He contends, that
it is as foolish to treat the stomach itselt
as it would be for a man who stepped on a
tack to rub liniment on the foot without
first removing the tack. Remove the tack
and the foot will heal itself —neutralise the
acid and the stomach troubles will disap-
pear. Irritating medicines and medical
treatments are useless, so long as the con-
tents of the stomach remain acid; remove
the acidity, and there will be no need tor
medicine —the inflamed lining of the stomacii
will then heal itself. Sufferers from acidity
should get a small bottle of bisurated mag-
nesia from their chemist, and take halt a
teaspoonful in a quarter of a glass of hot or
cold water after meals, repeating in fatteen
minutes, if necessary, this being the dose
which the doctor has found most efficacious
in all cases.*
IN BANANA LAND
“Don Q.”: Men in the Brisbane meat trade
report that somebody or something is buy-
ing up retail meat stores in Brisbane, and
sub-letting them —in fact, making .tied
houses of them. What’s in the wind?
Anybody heard anything of a Meat Ring or
a. Beef Trust lately?
The Government has settled up with the
widows of the half-dozen men killed in the
smash at Murphy’s Creek for a sum-total of
£7750. The officials whom Commissioner
Evans thought worthy of being disrated on
account of culpable negligence have been
re-instated, and the taxpayer assumes the
burden as usual.
The most thoroughgoing Wowser of the
year has been heard of from Brisbane. A
mutilated complainant deposed that he had,
in genial mood, asked a certain citizen to
come for a drink —whereupon the latter,
infuriated, had struck him to the ground
and torn off one half of his ear. The plain-
tiff produced his ear and a half in proof,
and the defendant more or less cheerfully
admitted his guilt. He would rather, it
seems, chew an ear than a beer any day.
Thursday Island has promise of develop-
ing a sponge industry sufficient to give the
death blow to the foreign mops, of which
last year £13,000 worth were imported. . A
famine in the big Mediterranean and Florida
grounds sent the producers farther afield,
and one firm has proved payable sponges
over a great area near “Thirsty.” The fly
in the ointment is that the labor, following
the pearling precedent, threatens to be yel-
low, and almost the only benefit Australia
will get in that case will be from a small
reduction in the price of what it washes
with.
Died lately, in the Mater Misericordise
Hospital, Robert North Bell, a pioneer of
the Barcoo and the Gulf Country, nsred 75.
He was a son of William Sims Bell, who
took up country on the Namoi with the first
of them. In fact, the Bells have been pi on-:
eering through three generations.' Otio'
grandfather came out as a lieutenant with
the first regiment to land in Sydney, and the
other grandfather—also a Bell—landed soon
after with another military consignment.
One of these Bells got a grant known as
Belmont; the other got the country where
Blacktown stands now. With his brother,
the just-dead Robert North Bell took up
Tambo station 50 years ago. and later on,
with Malcolm McEackarn, had Strathfield,
on the Gulf, and he worked that country for
the last 35 years.
Passed out, John Asher Benjamin, N.Q.
identity. He was a good citizen and good
snort; twice Mayor of Charters Towers;
member of a dozen public bodies; founder
and mainstay of local Ambulance Brigade;
president of N.Q. Racing Executive and
Rugby Union, and generous patron of all
clean pastime. In political theory a hearty
Tory, but in practice the kindliest of Demo-
crats. His business should have made his
fortune a few times over, but he was too
fond of helping lame or decrepit dogs to
Dave much behind. Ravenswood and the
Cape knew him in the early days, and the
old hands scattered over H’e North will re-
gret the Jew who ivas taken where many
Christians could so easily have been spared.
Incidentally, there were not enough Hebrews
in Charters Towers, Ravenswood - and-
Townsville to properly carry out the rites
of death and burial pertaining to the ancient
faith. So he went Abrahamwards without
any fuss. He’ll get there just the same.
A. M. Campbell, Government Secretary
of Papua since Anthony Musgrave’s retire-
ment some seven years ago,' lias passed in
liis papers, too. The whispered reason for
his retirement is the attitude he recently
took up in the Papuan Legislative Council.
That Council consists of six members. Three
are Government officials and three the
elected ’representatives of miners, traders
and missions. The Governor presides, with
a casting Vote. Recently the “unofficials”
brought forward a Bill to make the whole
Council elective. Lieut.-Governor Murray
is notoriously opposed to the idea, anil
everyone, including the “unofficials,” looked
on the proposal as belonging to the Born-
dead family. And then Campbell, formerly
a downright Government man, decided to get
up on the fence and declined to vote. The
boiling rage of his party was only excelled
by Hie , boiling astonishment of the “un-
officials.” The Bill was banged through,
Murray being powerless to stop it. Now
there is a vacancy for a new Secretary.
Two of the senior R.M.’s are mentioned ; but
since only one is much of a hand in an office,
he’ll probably get the job—unless they send
up a clerk from Melbourne.
THE STINGY HUSBAND.
HELEN : " Oh , Henry! Here are three vans and five horses, two fire engines and a
funeral ail coining up the street together?"
HENRY: “ Yes — that'll be your dressmaker's bill. You said you expected it this afternoon .”
The northern end of Bananaland has
developed a vegetable pest in the “finger
cherry.” Its fruit is an attractive-looking
berry, very red to the eyes of the youngster.
It has crept out of the scrub towards the
towns, or the towfls have crept into the
scrub to it ; anyhow, frequent children have
eaten the forbidden fruit, the penalty for
which is total blindness. The Government
is'hastening to the attack; it has issued all
manner of warnings, and makes a big pro-
mise to eradicate the pest—some day.
Two publicans convicted at Mackay of
selling adulterated liquor, for which they
were fined £6 each, have been ordered, under
the provisions of the new Liquor Act, to
exhibit outside their groggeries, for a fort-
night, placards to the effect that they were
found selling bogus goods. One Bung has
to exhibit two notices, one for brandy and
one for whisky. A penalty of £2 a day is
provided for failure to comply with this
provision. Had Queensland’s Pure Foods
Bill of two years ago got through in its
original form, three milkmen, convicted, on
the same day as the publicans, of having
added as much as 28 per cent, water to
their milk, would have had to tack a notice
on their carts : “I sell milk and water.”
Delightfully naive was the assumption by
the Brisbane press, as soon as it was alleged
that the new English bishopric of Chelms-
ford had been offered to Archbishop Donald-
son, that he would accept it for a certainty.
Said one daily: “The archbishopric of Bris-
bane is worth only £1250 per annum, while
the Chelmsford position will probably be
worth from £2500 to £8000.” Under these
circumstances no sane daily could for a
moment imagine Donaldson refusing the new
billet. How these journals admire the
“higher” clergy!
One Oswald has just completed the two
years’ job of cutting a track from Cedar
Creek and Ravenshoe on the tableland
(N.Q.) to Jordan Creek and Innisfail, on
the coast. The distance is 60 miles, and the
scrub is like a stone wall decorated with
spikes afid serpents. The pathfinder’s only
companion was a dog, and it wasn’t a tree-
climbing dog that could get up to an eleva-
tion to breathe, so it was often nearly suffo-
cated in the thick timber. By great good
fortune Oswald is only 70 years of age. If
he had been an old josser, the devastating
and everlastingly accursed climate would
probably have done for him.
A Mrs. J. J. Dowling, widow of the late
head of the Hawaii Preserving Co., called
in at Brisbane last week and explained mat-
ters thus to the local press:—
We have no labor question in Honolulu. The
absence of this problem is a delightful feature. Our
men get 22d015. a month and no feed, and they work
from )/ a.m. to 5 p.m., and never go on strike. The
labor on the plantations is chiefly Jap, Chinese or
Portuguese. On the island we have 80,000 Asiatics,
and from 12,000 to 15,000 whites, including soldiers.
Five and a half dollars a week and feed
yourself! Thirteen hours a day and no holi-
days ! Yet sundry fanatics say the Aus-
tralian toiler has nothing left to fight for!
(P.S. —Also there some fanatics tvlio say
that Australian industries don’t need High
Protection.)
Premier Denham remarked lately that he
wasn’t harassed over the Yankee Meat
Trust, because the Government, being the
owner of the railways, can suppress any
Trust. But can it? Suppose the Trust
gets a lien on practically all the approach-
ing beef of the next few years ! The State
can certainly refuse to carry Trust beef on
its lines, or can refuse to carry it save at
exorbitant figures, or can order it to be
dragged behind at the end of a rope as a
sign of opprobrium. In the first case the
coastal towns will be mighty short of beef.
In the second the coastal towns will pay a
mighty high price for their beef. In the
third, the beef would be dirty and full of
ballast. If Brisbane is reduced to vegetables
because the Government, having let the
Trust get all the beef, refuses, on a point
of principle, to carry Trust beef on its rail-
ways, the Denham Government will as-
suredly hear from Brisbane. And what it
will hear will be bricks. A Tory Premier
who talks like Denham can hardly expect
to be taken seriously.
“Martin”: “Beyondrepair” was doing the “Monte
Cristo” act —diving into the baths enclosed in a sack.
He practised in a tank in the backyard—until some-
body left out the water. The fateful day at last
arrived when he had to his “stunt.” Someone pushed
him off the tower, but after striking the water he
failed to come up. A local swimmer got him out
and applied first-aid. , “Some blighter changed the
sack,” he spluttered. “I couldn’t cut my way out
of it.” A farmer present laughed. “Why, of course,”
he grinned. “It’s one of the Sack Specialists’
sacks. They’re tough sacks from T. Smith’s, Ltd.,
Sussex Street, Sydney.”*

The Cradle Song.
[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
As I rode through the town at even time,
The black of the night skies over me.
And the old regrets to cover me
With-an unforgiven wrong;
Out of the square of a lighted window
Where an oil-lamp flickered behind a pane.
Came the croon of a cradle song....
Picaroons of the night, the ’possums,
Up in the fruit trees were a-swing,
And some sly-footed, stealthy thing
Followed my horse’s hoofs along—-
And over the thieving things of night
There called the glow of that homely light
And the cheer of that cradle song. . ..
As I rode out to the low grey ranges
(The track was a ribbon between the trees
Spinifex to the horse’s knees
And a dusty trail.... and long. . . .)
The ancient evil had ceased to sway
And the smart of the old hate died away
To the croon of a cradle song....
QUEENSLAND.
M. FORREST.
QUEENSLAND GOSSIP-
Brisbane,. January 31, 1914.
My Dear Titakcominrati, —
The Chiel Macgregoi- has spent a quiet
week, but fiext. week he -will resume- his
breathless exertions and hurl himself at- the
job of uncorking the Stantliorpe’ show. The
Talbot aide will pass the corkscrew or the
pickaxe,or something.
Alexander Raff, M.L.C., aged 93. passed
over this week. Almost 70 years of his life
were spent in Queensland, and the intoler-
able climate did him about the usual amount
of harm. He was a member of the firm of
Smellie and Co., and before that was a pas-
toralist and manager of several estates.
James Allan, M.L.A., fed .all the visiting
yachtsman at Allan and Stark’s CafA on
Tuesday. and on Monday the Brisbane
Dinghy Club gave them a concert in the
Albert Hall. The concert wasn’t so filling as
Allan’s contribution, but they all seemed
satisfied.
One of our prettiest young matrons, Mrs.
William Collins, landed in your town last
week, after a holiday in England and
Europe. While in England she- shook paws
with Oeorge Five and Mary his wife.. She
says they are just ordinary paws with five
talons apiece. The Colli children are to
stay in Sydney until after the hot weather
(applause), but Mrs. Collins arrived here
this morning (cheers).
Olive King, daughter of Mr. and Mrs.
,T. ,T. King, of Corinda, wedded on Monday
night one Kittle, son of Parson Kittle. The
bride was upholstered in white satin, and the
two pretty bridesmaids, Dorothy King and
Alice Kittle, also wore white. After the
marriage pastry had been dissected, the
newly-hitched left for Pialba, where they
are going to live.
Medico W. N. Robertson and his popular
wife have fled to Tasmania. While hubby
blossoms forth at the Medical Congress, the
missus will trot round with her sister-in-
law, Mrs. Tom Robertson, who also is
sampling ozone in the Apple Isle.
A Society dame was recently handed a
young bull pup by an admirer. She liked
the animal until it partially devoured hex-
prize collie' dog, and went the entire canni-
bal on a large cat. Also the brute attempted
to tear a meal off the lady’s arm, so that
the family cobbler had to come along and
sew up the rents. Thereabouts the pup was
returned with heartfelt absence of thanks
and a large bruise on his most subsequent
land-mark.
Mrs. Lord, of Fiji, has been spending a
holiday in Brisbane. ' Her father, E. B.
Forrest, has not been- too well lately (this
is a complaint few people suffer from), and
she tripped across to cheer him up.
The Sal. Army hasn’t been getting a very
profitable advertisement in Brisbane lately.
One night last week its “Rescue” Home at
Taringa (near Brisbane) caught alight, and
inside an hour it and. three of the inmates
were of no further use in this world. Next
day one of the remaining boarders was ar-
rested and is alleged to have owned up and
given a few reasons. She said she would
rather do six months in gaol than _ in the
“rescue” home, and claimed that during the
two months she’d been there she had not been
outside once. She also made a remark or
two about an excessive supply of rats, etc.,
on the premises, and if the police hadn’t
asked her to postpone the yarn, no doubt
the Sal. Army wouldn’t have had to wait
until February 5 to hear further uncompli-
mentary things about its “Home.” Still
the young lady has promised not to disap-
point it. Of course, what she alleges may
be all a yarn ; but if it is proved the Army
will have to bang its biggest drum very hard
to drown the subsequent commotion.
Yours affectionately,
AUSTRALIA JANE.
Just passed away, Fox, M.L.A., who sat
in the State Parliament for nearly 20
years. Fox was a curious compound of
extreme Radicalism in theory and staunch
Toryism in practice. He didn’t make a
speech in public once in three years, seldom
attended Parliament of late, and held the
safest seat in the Assembly. Personalty he
was a genial soul who loved most things
and couldn’t hate even his Labor opponents.
The climate wiped him out at 78.

Motorists desirous of having larger tyres fitted to their standard rims without going to the
expense of, or being inconvenienced by, the re-building of their wheels, cannot do better than
fit CONTINENTAL “OVERSIZE” TYRES. The many advantages of “Oversizes”
has become apparent to thousands of Australian Motorists, who recognise that the increased
air capacity must necessarily add to the tyre mileage and incidentally reduce vibration, and
—most important of all —a big Decrease in their Tyre Bill.

ANTINEURASTHIN
TRE \TMENT OF
NERVOUS and WASTING DISEASES.
Ihe wonderful properties of Antineurasthin (Leci-
thin in an absolutely pure form) for successfully
treating all nerve maladies, Dyspepsia, Anaemia,
Rheumatism, etc., and imparting permanent mental
and nerve force, reflect the latest and most important
achievements in medical science.
One of the most important of the wonderful re-
sults obtained by this treatment is that not alone
does it build up the nervous system by feeding the
brain and nerve-cells with their natural food ele-
ment, but on account of its beneficial action upon
the process of nutrition and upon the blood, the
whole general health shows prompt improvement,
particularly in wasting diseases.
A FREE TRIAL.

ANSWERS to CORRESPONDENTS.
Xo notice (except of a hostile character) will be
taken of communications insufficiently stamped.
Name and address must appear on MSS. No
liability is undertaken re contributions volun-
tarily submittedj and no MS. will be returned
unless stamps accompany.
Thomas Jones: You’ve got that joke
wrong. In its original form it was a great deal
brighter that is to say, before age made it dim. .. .
Gordon C.: A riddle like that can only be illustrated
with two motionless figures—one with his mouth
open asking the question and the other with his
ears well forward listening to it. And you can fix
that kind of riddle on anybody. You can even draw
two Arabs meeting in a desert, and one of them ask-
ing the other, “When is a door not a door?’’....
Chetwynd: There is no hope for you until you eschew
long words that you don’t understand, and often
can’t spell, and stick to simple language which means
something. We cannot return MS. of unaccepted
pars. .. . J R. Sneden: “White Australia a myth, a
chimera’’! Have you got a daughter? If you have,
when you see her holding a Chinaman’s mongrel, or
a Hindu’s half-caste to her bosom, don’t worry—
keep on thinking it’s a myth. .. .William Whiskers;
Si t. hedger helped to misrepresent Queensland in the
Senate until quite recently.... Ananias: You’ve
chosen a suitable pen-name, anyhow. The yarn dates
from about that period. .. .Inquirer: Phil May was
born April 22, 1864; died, August 5, 1903 W.M.
(W.A.).: The “Mount Rennie outrage,” as it was
called, took place on September 9, 1886. The real
outrage, which was the disgracefully lopsided trial,
took place some weeks later. .. .Ivor: There is no
joy in it....Makiro Taihape: Rather flat variety of
mirth A.R.: The time is past when people re-
garded it as a joke to draw a picture of one man
saying to another that civil servants don’t work....
C.G.AV.: That “one blanlcy man one blanky vote” jest
dates back to the time of the anti-plural-voting agi-
tation in N.S.W. some 20 years ago. You have an
illimitable front to try to pass it off as something
new. . . .F.L.R. : Not promising. . . .Camoo; Feeble
variation of aged jest J.E.N.: The cow joke
requires to be something special nowadays to pass.
There have been so many cow jokes. .. .Split-Link:
Some of them are bad and some are worse, and the
worst ones are dreadful. .. .R.8.M.: There is none...
Bloore: There is probably a par in that overtime
matter, but you leave us in a dense fog as to what the
trouble is about. .. .L.F.Y.: Forced humor....
•T.8.H.: No bite in it.... Afar (Q.) : Likely material,
but you don’t serve it up well enough. Might go
elsewhere. Returning MS H.D. (Q.) : Don’t want
anything that has been previously printed elsewhere.
- ...R.J.L.: Can see they are original; they’re too
bad to be anything else Talia: It lacks force
N.H. (V.): Toast is cold J.S.: She might, or
again she might not. Anyhow, it isn’t a subject for
crude verse S.R.S. (W.A.j ; Sorry all unsuitable.
A.S.M.: You’re a space-eater... .Rua : Under-
proof stuff... .Lochryan: Story out of B.’s line and
class Arthur H.: Neither Ronda: Both a
little out of focus.... A. 8.: Not convincing. .. .1.F.:
“Amiable S.” is too fragmentary. No print value.
. . . .Warden: Well, just a bit of it:—
So she went down forthwith into the West,
And all the winds that ever were rose up,
And all the birds flew up with clamorous cries
And the sun sank before her and the moon,
That very pale-faced lady of the night
Who swoons upon her couch of silver clouds,
Fled like a dove a-down the isles of Sleep.
Her name was Mystery and her eyes were blind!
.. . .C.C.T. (Q.) : Don’t want it E.A.T. : Promis-
ing theme, but the treatment isn't good enough
Pennant: Forced humor. Anyway a curious sea-
tragedy is not a good thing to start on. .. . W.H.8.:
Sorry too thin. . . ,B. Bluegum: A heavy product. .. .
Theo; You don’t want it, and we don’t want it. The
basket doesn’t want it either, but it has to have it
poor brute....
TO ARTISTIC (AND INARTISTIC)
CORRESPONDENTS.
J.G.A. : That hymn joke came out of Egypt many
years ag0....W.5. (W.A.) : The drunk is too calm
and sober and the fishmonger appears to be glued to
the wall. The counter is more like a stair-rail than
anything else, and there is a general lack of anima-
tion that is very dreadful. Also the crayfish joke
smells old T.R.11.: Cartoon idea is not worth
while Jerry: You’ve got some ideas, but the draw-
ing is so scratchy that it looks like a design on wire
gauze.. ..E.B.M. (M.L.) : One of the oldest known
gags, and the drawing is not good enough. .. .Lind-
jj-: One is a most conspicuous chestnut, and
that fact casts a cloud of suspicion over the other...
Clarence O’B.: The picture looks very like a copy, and
the gag looks the same way C.H.G.: Two jokes
are old. One isn’t a joke. Three pictures aren’t pic-
tures, but just plain smudge F.C.: Sketches,
drawn by you in few minutes, to hand. Send us
along something carefully evolved in a few hours
and we will talk to y0u.... D.C.T.S.: You send us
three gags and we recognise two of them as old
ottenders, so we fired the other on account of the
awful company it was in C.K.P.: There is a
whole, cloud of suspicion about “English as She is
Spoke. It is the work of an experienced artist, but
no experienced artist would have sent it in as you
did. Now where did you crib it from ?. .. . S.T.
(Waverley) : You are another unfortunate who can
draw excellently and does not know the first rule of
drawing for reproduction. Also, your gag is old.
The South Head signal station at the
entrance to Sydney Harbor is just about
the most ancient institution in Australia:
it began its career under Captain Hunter, of
H.M.S. Sirius, during January, 1790. Up
to that time no relief ship with stores or
dispatches had arrived from England, and
supplies of rum and other food were run-
ning short. Governor Phillip was afraid
that his dispatches had gone astray and
that any storeship coming out would seek
him at Botany Bay, and not finding the
settlement there would conclude that he had
abandoned the colony and would return to
England. So he sent a party of marines
each week to Botany Bay to seek any ship
that might arrive. Captain Hunter at the
same time established the South Head signal
station, and a party of seamen under an
officer kept watch. The first vessel to be
signalled was the tender Supply, which
arrived from Norfolk Island on February
10, 1790. From that date the site of Syd-
ney s principal signal station has never been
shifted.
4? Australian mining engineer, recently
holidaying in Melbourne from Korea, where
his job is, gave some particulars of that deli-
cate courtesy to foreigners whicn, according
to the brindle press, is so universally charac-
teristic of the large-minded Jap. (Korea is
the kingdom that was one vast Peace Society
until Japan rewarded it for its touching con-
fidence by “annexing” it) :
In Korea it is compulsory for one on arriving at
an hotel to supply one’s name, nationality, occupa-
tion, destination, time of arrival, probable length of
stay, business and so on. Each night these particu-
lars are collected by the police, who are thus in a
position to put their hands upon any visitor at very
short notice. In Korea 80 or 90 per cent, of the
letters that pass through the mail are opened by
Japanese postal officials. This is also a practice in
Japan, although theoretically the postal employee
who tampers with a letter is liable to imprisonment.
Still, we knew most of that before. What
we should like to know now is what would
happen to you, suppose you camped with a
man-o -war in Tokio’s back-yard, and swore
that you were busy looking for the South
Pole.

my nose and quickly spread over my face
and head, causing my face and head to
swell, making my features unrecognisable,
I cannot very Well explain how I suffered,
but the pains were very severe, causing great
distress, I was unconscious for days; could
hot rest day or night for pain, itching and
burning, ’The doctor pulled me through the
first attack all right, but it kept breaking out
on my face every few months, but not so
bad as the first attack, It Would disfigure
me for days, so much that I would hob let
anybody but our own family see me.
"Seeing the Cuticura advertisement iri

a return of it, and that is twenty odd years

AN INTERESTING
EXPERIMENT.
If you would like to see the alteration Grey Hairs
make, just lay a piece of paper over each of the two
of the above portrait. The Grey “half” will
then be seen to have the appearance of 45 years of
age, whereas the other half looks only 30. Dr. B.
Allen’s (U.S.A.) Mexican Walnut Stain will make
all those years of difference if you are grey or prema-
turely grey. It is perfectly harmless, easy to apply,
and will quickly restore the Hair to the natural shade
of youth, or younger years.
Dr. B. ALLEN’S

is offered as a Superior Stain. It contains no lead,

New Preparation
Causes Big Scare Among Hair Specialists.
My True Hair Grower has a most wonder-
ful effect upon the hair glands and tissues
of the scalp. It is the only remedy for the
hair ever discovered that is similar to the
natural hair foods or liquids-of the scalp.
It penetrates the pores quickly, and the
hair soon shows the effects of its wonder-
fully exhilarating and life-producing quali-
ties. ' •
Besides being a True Hair Grower, my
preparation quickly removes DANDRUFF,
and stops FALLING HAIR and ITCHING.
It is known the world over, and I have in
my consulting-rooms upwards of 3000 grate-
ful letters from men and women who have
derived so much benefit from the use of my
True Hair Grower as to compel them to
write and thank me.

“His Nibs’”: Anibngst an astonishingly dull lot’of
interview writers on the Sydney newspapers, there is
one on the Sunday Times who puts me m the
greatest good humor with the Day of Rust. He
combines the characteristics of a confirmed Wowser
with those of a press cub, so that I picture him as
a youth of 17 with a full set of whiskers. His finest
effort was published lately in the shape of an
interview with a mother of five children, aged from
one to seven years. This family, . according to the
report, was on the verge of starvation, and our young
friend questioned the unfortunate woman at length
on the details of her poverty. Said he (as he prints
the. conversation) : “Now, tell mq, How do you find
food and clothes for the children?” (Explanation
given.) Young Whiskers: “But I am still m the
dark. What food do you get in during the week ?.
(Question answered.) Young Whiskers: Why don t
you apply for State aid for the children?’ (An-
swered) Young Whiskers: “What are your plans?.
The victim opined that she had none, so the little
Wowser came to her rescue. Says he: “It’s shocking
to think that the widow and fatherless should suffer
such destitution in a land flowing with milk and
honey. But there are better days in store, perhaps.
The children will take a hand when they go to work.’
’Tisn’t everybody who’d have dropped on that solu-
tion so easy. It would never have crossed the
ordinary mind t.ha t in 15 or 16 years even the
youngest child would be earning sufficient to buy,
not only bread, but perhaps prawns and beer.
Starving, forsooth. Go to, my good woman!
Tit-Bits is unkind. It (November 8) describes
George Reid as a very fat man who was formerly
Premier of Maoriland. This is probably deliberate
misinformation due to professional jealousy. they
are two of a trade.
“Thirteen Ems”: Have just struck an old volume
of the Colonial Monthly, of 1869, an early Mel-
bourne magazine which lived a few years only. It
was illustrated by Tom Carrington, and the Carring-
ton touch was so like Du Maurier’s that the Colonial
Monthly looks as if it stole its drawings from Lon-
don Punch. The serial is: “Double Harness, or
Pierce Charlton’s Wives, by George Arthur Walstab,
a very readable novel of the stilted time. All through
Sir Maudesley drinks burgundy, peels walnuts and
sneers at Mr. Baring Barrington. The verse section
of the maga. is execrable. There are two or more
pages of Greek translations and of Latin enigmas
and charades, all those contributors with nothing to
say having a very strong desire to show off all the
defunct language they knew. The doings of the
month are the most interesting. “Mr. Everard has
refused to obey the request of the electors of Colling-
wood for his resignation” ; and the Eight-hour move-
ment is being warmly agitated. A return subscrip-
tion ball was given to Mowbray, Mayor of Melbourne,
at the Criterion Hotel, the Governor and a large
number of citizens being present. This mayor, who
succeeded Jim Butters, the mayor of 1868, was loaded
with honors that month. The Gas Co.’s new gaso-
meter was named after him, and he presided over a
number of other humorless people at a luncheon laid
inside the big tank. It is recorded that “colonial
literary merit” is not entirely unappreciated at
home.” “A volume of poems, by Mr. A. L. Gordon,
the well-known gentleman rider, entitled ‘Sea Spray
and Smoke Drift,’ was some time ago sent to Cap-
tain Whyte Melville, the novelist, by a gentleman in
Adelaide, and Captain Melville, in reply, has written
a letter, commenting in the most flattering terms on
Mr. Gordon’s ability.” Also: “Mr. Kendall’s collec-
tion of poems, published last month, has been favor-
ably reviewed by the press of the colonies, and very
well received by the public.” Bandmann was at the
Theatre Royal playing Hamlet, Shylock, Othello,
Claude Melnotte and Richelieu. Mrs. Steele, who
was playing Emilia, was wounded in the face by
Bandmann’s sword in the last scene of “Othello”;
and Dr. Neild, who seems to have lived in theatres,
came from the audience to attend the lady. Dr.
Lang, the veteran politician of Sydney, is “almost
convalescent,” and there is a movement in Sydney to
erect a monument to Dr. Bland. Other Sydney news
includes the opening of the Western Railway to
Bowenfels; the. arrival of the Faraway from ’Frisco
with 18,000 quarters of wheat for Sydney; and the
sale of steamers in the MacArthur estate. The
A.S.N. Co. bought the steamship Havilah for £B2OO,
and the swiftest of the local steam yachts, the Fairy,
was knocked down for £660. The Wonga Wonga is
to be placed pn the Maoriland line.” In the South
Aus. Parliament the proposal for a day of humilia-
tion and prayer to frighten the drought away met
strong opposition. “Seeing that we subscribe to
send missionaries to cure Central Africa of Fetichism
and belief in Rain-makers, one gentleman did not see
the force of our practising Fetichism in South Aus-

THE PURE POLICEMAN WHO FELL INTO
PSYCHE’S BATH.
[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
'•The postcards which formed the subject of the
prosecution were reproductions of La Oigale, by
Chanteron; First Poße, by Rondell; Bath of Venus,
by Godward; and Bath of Psyche, bv Chevalier.—
Extract from report of S,A. prosecution for ‘sell-
ing indecent pictures>” instigated by the usual in-
artistic policeman.
Full many a Hop of purest ray Serene
In dark, uttfathonied print shops lays hiß snare;
Full many a youth takes care to blush unseen
O’er lovely nudes that Adelaide calls “bare,”
The village Pecksniff that, with dauntless hide,
Will Seek for Satan with a small-tooth comtq
In Adelaide may peacefully abide
And Snuffle till the rev’rent cows come home.
There he may take his shower-bath fully dressed—
Or otherwise itt darkness. Or, by Gosh!
His moral attitude may be expressed
By vowing nevfef mote to scrub or Wash;
Oh, Adelaide’s not Paris, thank the Lord,,..
And Paris is not Adelaide! (For that '
Another burst of gratitude record!)
We nothing want of Paris but its hat.
Behold the haloed Hop upon his beat !
A traveling moral seismograph is he,
Partly a-wing and partly on his feet,
He sneaks in Search of fair indecency,
Be gentle with the Hop ! The convent maid;
Who trembles rosily before a boy,
Of this world’s snares could not be more afraid
Than this poor stalwart, ill at ease and boy.
If he had brains he’d not be what he is,
For there is little money on the beat;
Yet, knowing naught, he is allowed to quiz
At Venus and condemn her with much heat!
Perhaps if Venus matched his own sweet shape,
And wore the perfect regulation boot,
His blushing, condemnation she’d escape
And all his virginal conventions suit.
The postcard can’t escape. The print shop stands
For ever rooted to the public street;
Whereas the thief laughs at his groping hands
And flies unkindly from the charted beat.
So then the Hop, slow-footed, slow of brain.
Becomes poor Beauty’s censor. ’Tis a sin ;
But idiocy, although it is a strain
On patience, makes the ribald hamlet grin.
, Lo ! here a Hop, of purest ray serene,,
In deep, artistic waters quickly sank;
While in the. reeds I saw sweet Psyche lean
And .mock him slyly from the grassy bank.

KIDNEY TROUBLES AND BACKACHE.
A Great Sufferer Cured by

Mrs. MYRA LAKE
(From a Photo.).
“I have been a
great sufferer with
kidney troubles
and gravel ever
since my baby was
born, about 18
months ago,”
writes Mrs. Myra
Lake, 11 Hartley
Street, RozelLe,
N.S.W. “The pain
in my side was so
severe that I used
to moan. I also
suffered with scald-
ing, and my water
was like mud. For
my complaints I
tried everything I
could think of, but
I derived no bene-
fit whatever. One
day I managed to
crawl up to my
mother’s place, and
she gave me a
bottle of Dr. Shel-
don’s Gin Fills, for
she said they were
the only thing that
would do me any
good. I took my
mother’s advice
and used the pills,
and they cured my
back, also my
other ailments, and
have made a new
woman of me alto-
gether. I can
now get ahead
with my house-
hold duties as well
as ever I did in my
life. Dr. Sheldon’s
Gin Tills are a splendid medicine for all women, and I shall always recommend
them, and also keep a bottle in the house.’
The Reliable Remedy for Ailing: Women. |
Backache and Kidney Trouble are only too prevalent nowadays, and to suc-
cessfully cure them it is necessary to use a special remedy designed particularly
for this trouble. Such a remedy is Dr Sheldon’s Gin Pills, which have attracted
so much attention in Australia during the past two years, on account of their
having relieved and cured so many cases of this kind.
They are a specially prepared Backache and Kidney Pill, entirely difrerent
from any other remedy on the market, and infinitely more efficacious. A trial
will convince the most sceptical. Sold in two size glass containers, at l/o and
2/6 per bottle.

Chronic Constipation is a common cause of anemia, dyspepsia,
headache, mental trouble and many other ills.
For Chronic Constipation, Indigestion, Biliousness, Dyspepsia, Torpid
Liver, Piles and similar troubles, Nature has happily furnished a
never-failing remedy. A systematic course of Hunyadi Janos Natural
Aperient Water will effect a certain and most likely permanent cure.
To obtain lasting good results it is of course necessary to regulate
most carefully diet and other details of daily life.

Towser's Pup: the Tragedy of
a Vegetarian Dog.
[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
It is said tliat even carnivorous animals attain
great size when fed on a purely vegetarian diet.
■ —English paper.
island in the midmost sea
Lay all untenanted and wild.
They took it without rent or fee,
And all its tropic beauty smiled
When, on a bright December day,
Their Ark within its harbor lay.
Their dogs were mostly fed on beans
And cabbages instead of meat,
While salads made of tender greens
Were their especial Sunday treat,
And people wondered when they saw
Them eating cauliblossoms raw.
The Ark was stored with simple life;
Two pleasant swine were brought to breed.
A young goat and his spotted wife,
And two white pigeons, all agreed,
Were quite the finest of their kind;
Also the dogs of gentle mind.
They had a pair of peaceful bees,
A brace of rabbits soft and mild,
One gentle mother on whose knees
There sat a young and lovely child,
And one young lady, lately wed,
With soft gold growing on her head.
These, with two men, tinned fruit and things,
A pot or two of marmalade,
Some seeds, umbrellas, flavorings,
A rake, a garden hose and spade,
And two large talking parrots chained,
Were all their simple Ark contained.
Yet all their hearts were very bold.
They built two houses on the isle,
And, recking not of fame or gold,
Taught the forgotten, waste to smile,
Till everywhere from shore to shore
Were cabbages and beans galore.
The population grew with speed,
The rabbits and the pigs were kind,
The pigeons were the first to breed,
The goats found all things to their mind.
The children grew a numerous band
Upon that sea-encircled land.
On vegetables, grain and roots
Man, beast and bird were all maintained ;
The island bushes yielded fruits,
And never blood the landscape stained;
So year by year saw an increase
Of goat and pigeon, joy and peace.
It was a pleasant thing to see
All frisking round a fallen log;
The rabbits, happy as could be,
Pursued a vegetarian dog;
Or on a summer morn to note
Young puppies riding on a goat,
While overhead the pigeons flew,
And parrots glancing here and there
Taught their young fledglings all they knew,
Instructing them to never swear;
The whole round island, as a rule,
Was gentle as a Sunday-school.
All things were fat and sleek and fair;
But larger, fairer than them all,
Clothed in a ragged mat of hair,
Stood one vast dog erect and tall;
Bean-fed. the child of Towser grew
Enough St. Bernard to make two.
A trader, floating down the world,
Looked in one pleasant summer day.
His whiskers with amazement curled
To see the pigs and dogs at play,
And fifty rabbits in a row
Helping a gentleman to hoe.
He deemed it was a pleasant isle;
The Golden Age had come again ;
Man, beast and bird were free from guile,
No pig made bacon to his pain;
And little pigeons learned to fly
With never thought of wrong or pie.
The sailors landed on the shore ;
They had been many weeks afloat;
They added to their larder’s store
By capturing a plavful goat,
And when they dressed and cut it up
They gave the scraps to Towser’s pup.
The gentle trader sailed away ;
The large dog sat and watched him go;
Then smiled as one who fain would say,
“I understand why rabbits grow,
And why the goats and pigs are bred—
They please me most when they are dead.”
That night the pup consumed a goat,
Enticed three pigeons from the trees,
Plucked them and saw the feathers float
Out seaward with the rising breeze.
And e’er the morn came sweet with dew
He polished off a pig or two.
A week, on quiet slaughter bent,
The canine wagged his tail and smiled;
By day he slumbered well content,
By night he ate a goat or child;
Swine, pigeons, parrots, children grew
Wary, alert and wondrous few.
The pup, with murder in his eye,
Grew daily bolder and more bold ;
One morn, when no one else was nigh,
He ate the dame with locks of gold;
And, as the taste was somewhat new,
He took her husband off to chew.
So one by one he cleared the isle
Of child end man and bird and beast.
The very dogs he caught with guile.
His mother graced his shameless feast.
She and his sire, head, tail and paw,
Were buried in their pup’s vast maw.
The trader, floating down the world,
Came back to view that blissful spot;
His whiskers with amazement curled
To find on shore of all the lot
Of simple creatures kind and free
Only three parrots in a tree.
But as he gazed there straight uprose
What erst he took for some huge log,
And, scenting game with lifted nose,
Leaped forth that vegetarian dog:
lie fell upon the trader’s crew,
Ate five and sorely mangled two.
They drove the hairy thing ashore,
Weighed anchor fast and put to sea,
And left the large pup dripping gore,
Yelping his hunger on the lee —
Oh, wise were they to keep afloat
Who first seduced that dog with goat!
And still within that lovely isle
Dwell three wise parrots on a bough.
While Towser’s pup, with bark and smile,
Keeps watch for some lone vessel’s prow;
And they who land learn what it means
To feed an infant dog on beans.

PAT O'MAORI.
Recruiting for the
Congregation.
[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
A collection of slightly exaggerated facts— the
exaggeration being necessary to get the proper atmo-
sphere of frenzy and incongruity. The thing
described appeared to the wife of a Bulletin man
living between Summer Hill and Manly, Sydney.
IT was 10 o’clock, and little Mrs. Mack
had just retired after doing the bolt
and bar rounds when the darkened
house was shaken to its foundations by a
thundering assault on the front door.
“He’s forgotten his key again, chattered
the lady irritably, and,, lighting the candle
threw on a pretty dressing-gown and lustied
down to let in her forgetful husband.
As the door swung open, she beheld a mat,
or portiere, or tapestry of coal-black whiskers
Above them —or it —was the upper end of a
large, white, angry face. Over the face and
partly on it was the low-comedy fiat hat ol
[he Church. Clerical garments. that looked
as if they had been cut by a devil and pitch-
forked together in the dark billowed and
bulged in all directions. An umbrella, old
and dusty enough to be canonised, threatened
everything.
Out of the mass of holy ugliness came a
rasping inquiry: “Good evening, my good
woman. May 1 ask what church you at-
tC Mrs. Mack stepped back in amazement, and
stared at the chaser of souls. It was ap-
parently genuine and in deadly earnest.
“You must really excuse me, she replied
crisply. “I only answered the door because I
thought someone had been locked out. Good
evening!” And she gently closed the dooi.
At least she closed it as far as the broad-
booted hoof of the saint, which he had care-
fully jammed against the post.
Mrs. Mack was a little out of breath when
the shoving contest was over. “Would you
mind taking your foot away, please.
Came the hollow reply: “My good woman,
I asked you just now what church you
attended !”
“Your foot is in the way!
“Yes, my good woman. But you haven t
answered” . . , ~
“Don’t dare to call me your ‘good woman I
And take your foot away, and stop asking
me that question. It isn’t any of your busi-
1U The mass of superfluous hair, and the hat
and the dreadful clothes exhibited symptoms
of suppressed fury. “My good woman, it is
my business ! I want to know V
“I don’t attend any church, it you must
know! Now please take your foot away and
allow me to shut the door!”
“My good woman, I am here to save your
soul!” . .
“It’s like your impertinence!
“Oh, sister! sister!” The apparition
threw tip its hands and balanced its whiskers
on its chin, but didn’t shift its hoof.
“Stop that silly acting!” snapped the lady
of the house. “Stop acting and go away at
OIICG !”
“Woe to this house!” bellowed the after-
hours’ saint dramatically.
“That’s threatening language! You 11
get yourself into trouble if you don t go
away! The idea of calling at such an hour
to pry into people’s business and abuse them!
If you’re a gentleman, take your foot away
and allow me to close the door!”
“Woe to the house where there is no reli-
gion !”
“WILL you take your foot away t
“Woe, I say! Repent while there is time !
Humble yourself ! Be meek !”
“We don’t want any of your religion! . ...
The idea of coming at such an hour! TAKE
YOUR FOOT AWAY!”
“My good woman ! I have come !
“I told you before not to call me that!
“I HAVE COME TO SAVE YOU !” The
cataract of whiskers trembled with emotion,
and the umbrella leaped into the air and
crashed to earth. “I have come to you with
the Light, and you would spurn me from
your door! Oh, sister, think what you are
doing ! Do not throw away this chance!
“What chance?”
“This chance I am offering you! Only
think, my good woman! To-night you may
breathe your last! To-night you may die,
and your soul!”
“Oh, don't be morbid!”
He stopped—stopped, altogether. His
whiskers stopped, and his eyebrows stopped,
and the umbrella became paralysed. lhen
the face and the hat away up beyond the
whiskers started to twitch up and down; a
large red mouth opened in the portiere of
whiskers ; the billowy, devil-hunting costume
seemed to inflate itself; and the semi-de-
tached umbrella gave convulsive jumps and
started to saw the air.
“Don’t—be—WHAT?”
“Don’t be morbid!”
“MORBID!” he intoned. Then, in a sort
of wild pulpit-howl, “DON’T BE MOR-
BID ! ! Oh-h, sister, don’t you know I’ve

from everlasting wrath and the Gates of

his words. “Don’t you see I’ve brought you
the Light?” (Four times up and down.)
“Oh- h-h, sister/ I have come to pluck the
brand from the burning l .” (Six times up
and six times down.) “To kin- die the Spark
of Love! To light!”
At that instant his obstructive hoof lifted
with the rest of him and his victim jumped
forward to slam the door; but the hem of
her dressing-gown tripped her up. As she
clutched to recover her balance, the candle
flew from her hand into the midst of the
whisker-curtain. There was a shriek in the
dark, a horrible smell of singeing, and a scuf-
fling sound like two mad cows rushing away
under the ruins of a collapsed marquee.
Mrs. Mack shut the door and refreshed her-
self with hysterics

Doan’s Backache Kidney Pills
are sold by all chemists and stores
at 2/9 per bottle (6 bottles 15/3),
or post free on receipt of price
from Foster-McClellan Co., 76
Pitt Street, Sydney.
Knough of this Poison gets into the Blood every few hours to cause death. Your kidneys
alone can save you.
When excess uric acid is left in the blood by weak kidneys it causes more disease than
any other poison—-
And it is more to be feared, because uric acid poisoning is slow, and hard to detect —yon
may not notice it at first, except for a feeling of heaviness, drowsiness and irritability; but
before long the trouble becomes more pronounced —the back aches —the limbs swell —the heart
becomes affedted; there are rheumatic pains; gravel is seen in the water, and the need to
relieve the bladder is much too frequent, especially at night.
Doan’s Backache Kidney Pills are a special kidney medicine; they promote a regular adtion
of the kidneys and bladder, so that the uric acid poison is taken out of the blood and drained
away; this medicine is therefore of the highest value in lumbago, backache, dropsy, inflamma-
tion of the bladder, distress in seeking relief, and any kidney or bladder irregularity.
CURED TO STAY CURED.
SYDNEY TESTIMONY.
Mr. Alfred Hairsine, Farnley, Cowles Road, Mosman, Sydney, says:—“For many years my wife suffered
with the kidneys and bladder. The symptoms were striking, aching pains in the back, and inability to retain the
secretions. She would have to get up four or five times every night, and this spoilt her rest. Resides, this, the
urine contained sediment and was stringy. Ten years ago, when in England, she consulted a doctor in Leeds ;
he failed to do her any good, and remarked to her: ‘There is something about your case that I cannot understand.’
I mention this fact because kidney trouble is often misunderstood. On our return to Sydney she went to one of
the leading doctors ; he said she was suffering from catarrh of the bladder (commonly called inflammation of the
bladder). He prescribed for her, but his medicine did her no good. She had several prescriptions made up,
and used various other remedies, but she was getting worse all the time. . She was scarcely able to get about,
and would be confined to her bed for days at a time. She commenced taking Doan’s Backache Kidney Pills in
January, 1904, and they soon made an improvement in her health by driving out the impurities through the secre-
tions in a natural manner. Before long she was able to walk about, the backache was cured, and the secretions
were regulated : thus she was not disturbed at night. Doan’s Backache Kidney. Pills have done her a wonderful
power of good. Seeing how Doan’s Backache Kidney Pills have benefited my wife, and not feeling well myself—I
had painful symptoms of urinary troubles and difficulty in passing the urine—I also commenced to take them.
They proved just as good in my case by regulating the secretions and expelling the sediment and other impurities.
We both feel better than we did for years, and the thanks are due to Doan’s Backache Kidney Pills.”
Eight years later Mr. Hairsine says :—“My wife and I have both been free of Kidney Trouble since Doan’s
Backache Kidney Pills cured us eight years ago ”

Kidney
PILLS.
By the Sobbing Sand of
Motuwai.
[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
AT Motuwai, in Maoriland, there is the
sobbing sand. If circumstances and
temperament be propitious, the grief
of the seashore will harrow the feelings of
the listener. So tradition has it. The con-
ditions necessary are a ground swell and an
absence of wind —and a pint of waipiro
administered internally. The latter is
merely a local custom. It does not belong
to tradition. Motuwai is one of “The
Bays.” At the back of the beach the swamp
land extends to the distant ranges. The
swamp is productive of native flax. There
is no other vegetation.
Tradition says that Maui, being wearied
with the doing of great deeds, slept. He
was awakened by the sound of weeping.
Hastening to the beach the demi-god found
a taniwha of great unloveliness abducting a
damsel who could have won a modern beauty
contest in an amble. With commendable
promptitude Maui slew the monster. As a
token of disrespect, or a punishment for per-
mitting such doings on its premises, Maui
condemned the sand to reproduce the
maiden’s clamor eternally. Therefore, if
you have imagination and patience, you may
listen to the sobbing sand of Motuwai.
Old man Hesketh was the pioneer pakelia
at Motuwai. He brought with him a horile
of dusky relatives-by-eustom, 'Some imple-
ments for dressing flax, and the experience
of 50 hard-bitten years. Thereafter there
was toil by the sobbing sand. Hesketh drove
his relatives by exhortation or the effective
argument of a pick handle. He was king,
judge, prosecutor and jury. On the whole
he ruled justly. His slogan was “work,”
and in time he inculcated in his followers/
some appreciation of the beneficial effect of
honest toil. The creek which drained the
swamp was dammed and a race cut. A
water-wheel was built and a crude flax-mill
erected. When the temporary exponents of
graft were about to settle down for their
siesta the old man hunted them into the
swamp to cut flax. Then he made for
Taiaroa Bay, where the schooner Bluefire
bred barnacles and sloth. Hesketh found
Captain Wenzel at his steady job of imbib-
ing waipiro, bewailing loss of business, and
extolling the bad old days when dishonest
men evaded their deserts. Wenzel had sailed
with Puhi Haaki, the more or less fictitious
buccaneer of the Pacific. That was his sole
claim to distinction. Apparently he was
satisfied to rest on his laurels. With him
Hesketh contracted for the carriage of his
hemp. So Motuwai’s solitary industry was
launched.
Hesketh had a son and a daughter. Both
were endowed with the handsomeness of the
half-caste. Their other attributes were also
those of the half-caste. Hesketh had the
strong man’s one weakness. He toiled that
Mary and her brother Rupa might be rich.
Which was a ludicrous motive, all things
considered. On his second appearance at
Motuwai Wenzel came ashore drunk. He
spent the day fraternising with the natives,
with whom he was a rangatira of great
tonnage. That night Mary came to the
whare which Hesketh designated his office
and told a tale that sent the old man blind,
berserk. Next day Rupa Hesketh, and those
of his people who were not incapacitated,
buried the old man within sight of the
charred remains of his mill. The Bluefire
was gone, and, with her, the beauteous Mary.
Rupa Hesketh swore that he, or his, would
be revenged. This is a practice common
in melodrama as well as amongst the Maori
people.
When hemp, having, slumped to zero, once
more became a marketable commodity, the
wise ones who sit in revolving chairs before
roll-top. desks took a hand in the game. The
men who had carried ' on the languishing
industry through many lenn years were
bought or squeezed out. If they kicked —
well, even a large-paunched philanthropist,
with a penchant for acquiring his neigh-
bor’s goods, will become reckless if you
frustrate his predatory schemes. That is
human nature —and PriVate Enterprise. If,
being wise in their generation, the pioneers
took the count, their obsequies were carried
out quietly and with despatch.
Hildebrand had been many things in his
day. Many of the things, viewed through
the moral lens of the obese'' citizen in his
drawing-room attitude, were not creditable.
During his 30-odd years Hildebrand had
retained a veneer of polish, lie was spoken
of as a gentleman, which description cover-
eth a. multitude of vices. In addition he had
cultivated a genial attitude towards all men.
From which you. will infer that Hildebrand
was a philosopher. And he had need of his
philosophy when he encountered Hodson &
Cos. Hodson & Cos. had many irons in the
fire. Old John Hodson was the man to see
that the irons didn’t get cold nor the fire
go . out. When hemp attained the dizzy
altitude of £3O per ton Hodson & Cos. in-
cluded the milling industry within the scope
of their operations. In the course of their
acquirements they wiped out Hildebrand.
Hildebrand had been within sight of afflu-
ence. His philosophy stood to him. Be-
cause of his complaisance and the know-
ledge he had gained Hildebrand was given
a job by John Hodson.
For a score of years Rupa Hesketh had
carried on, in desultory fashion, the industry
instituted by his sire. He had not made a
fortune. When a plausible stranger ap-
peared and announced that Messrs. Hodson
& Cos. had acquired a lease of the Motuwai
swamp and the land adjacent thereto Rupa
accepted the information stolidly. Things
could not be much worse with him. And
the tribe of young Heskeths were mostly
grown and able to fend for themselves.
Therefore Rupa drank the stranger’s
waipiro, and played many games of euchre
with that polished individual. Asa matter
of fact, Hildebrand was a much disguised
fairy godmother. When the carpenters,
having completed the mill, went away, a
horde of scutchers, catchers and flax-cutters
took their place. Their advent marked the
commencement of Rupa’s prosperity. It
was Hildebrand, manager for Hodson & Cos.,
who suggested and provided means. He
knew the mill hands and their need. The
waipiro was not the only attraction at
Rupa’s grog-shop. Arini was a flawless
specimen of Maori maidenhood. Amongst
the tattooed beldams and slatterns of
Motuwai she stood alone. The hands early
learnt that she was not for them. At
Motuwai Hildebrand had no rival.
A man once said that John Hodson had
tio virtues and but one vice. As the speaker
had seen the product of his brain and the
best part of his life added to the opulence
of John H. he may have exaggerated facts.
Of a certainty cold-blooded rapacity was
Hodson’s principal characteristic. A brief
period of married life had given him a son.
To his sycophants it was known that Hod-
son’s paternal pride was of gigantic pro-
portions. To John himself it was old know-
ledge that were it not for his dreams of the
boy’s future the acquisition of much wealth
would have been arid work. To the public,
which browses on the anaemic platitudes
promulgated by the daily press, John Hod-
son was an estimable citizen, with a stake
in the country, and a burning desire for the
maintenance of law-and-order.
The adage to the effect that the spectator
sees most of the game did not apply to the
crew of the Beautiful Belle. We saw bits
of many games. Never did we view the
entire performance. Sometimes it was the
beginning, sometimes the end, but more often
just a scene from the midriff of some obscure
farcical tragedy of “The Bays.” Humor,
like life itself, was raw. Once when the
Belle swung into Waipiro Bay the old man
observed that the citizens of that township
were to be complimented on having provided
the jetty with a decent light. Before the
Belle arrived alongside the light had ex-
pired. We berthed, amidst the curses of the
skipper and the groans of a sufferer. The
latter was the township’s permanent drunk.
Whilst he had slept, some humorists, having
saturated his whiskers with kerosene, had
applied a light to the hirsute appendage.
Thereafter he eschewed strong drink.
On our third call at Motuwai we landed
a passenger. Dick Hodson was the antithesis
of his sire. He had a way with him which
won the affection of the crew of the mis-
named cargo-carrier. For the rest, he was
young and had quite a lot to learn. Under
pretext of studying the hemp industry at its
source, Dick had escaped the jealous eye of
the old man. He meant to have the time of
his life.
Hildebrand occupied a bungalow adjacent
to tlie mill. Maahi, the least beautiful lady
at . Motuwai, was cook and housemaid. In
neither capacity was she ornamental or
useful. Between herself and Hildebrand
there existed a firm friendship. Therefore,
despite her incompetence and the steady de-
preciation of household treasures, Maahi
kept her job and a place in the poker school
in the back room of Rupa’s shanty. Hilde-
brand was a regular attendant at the
academy. Play commenced early and lasted
all night. It was Motuwai’s one social
function.
Into Hildebrand’s disorderly menage Fate
projected Dick Hodson. Because of the
made-to-measure existence he had suffered,
Hodson relished an environment which
would have filled an older sinner with dis-
gust. In his eyes Hildebrand was all that
a man of the world should be. When he
tired of loafing round the mill Dick went
into the swamp and slaughtered pukekos
with an aged shot-gun. Since neither the
poker game nor the bar attracted him for
long, he sought other entertainment in the
evening. Arini supplied the deficiency.
Arini, under the guidance of sundry persons,
played the game like a pakeha lady. From
the first Dick’s case was hopeless. When
he would have closed the incident lie was
confronted by a tearful maiden with a
blasted reputation and a blackened future.
Dick went to Hildebrand for advice.
Hodson came aboard with Arini, his wife.
He was legally married to this young Witch
of Endor, and was, he said, seeking the
paternal blessing. A deputation went shore-
ward to express the opinion of the ship’s
company regarding Hildebrand’s part in the
affair. It was a futile expedition. Hilde-
brand was dead to the world.
Just what John Hodson said when intro-
duced to his daughter-in-law did not tran-
spire. Much may be forgiven a father when
he sees his dream-castles collapse like the
construction of Jerry the builder during an
earthquake. The same day old John received
a notification from Hildebrand. It stated
that the Native Land Board had declared the
Hodson lease to be invalid. Hildebrand had,
therefore, secured a lease of the Motuwai
swamp from the real owner, one Rupert
Hesketh, a descendant of the maiden rescued
by Maui. Hodson was a fighter. He de-
cided to have it out with Hildebrand.
At dusk the Belle slowed down off Motu-
wai. Hodson fretted at the ship’s rail like a
lover with a tryst to keep. The surfboat;
landed the old man and his effects. The Belle
swung outwards and headed north.
That was the last appearance on any stage
of John Hodson. Investigation elicited no-
thing concerning his exit. That he did not
meet Hildebrand was certain. The latter
was in Auckland disposing of his recently-
acquired lease. Maybe there was truth in
the rumor that on the Sobbing Sand of
Motuwai the old man received an overdue
welcome from Rupa Hesketh and his once-
beauteous sister Maahi. Hodson had ignored
an incident of his career when he was
known as Captain Wenzel, of the schooner
Bluefire. But Rupa was a patient man and
a long-distance hater.

CONCERNING A COMMON COMPLAINT.
Of all common ailments perhaps Constipation is the one most fruitful of
ill-health and a potent cause of disease in a variety of forms. Too fre-
quently neglected (especially by women) it may result in grave conse-
quences, and all who suffer from it in any degree should set about
establishing a permanent cure without delay. Failure of the bowels to
act properly results in poisonous accumulations, impure blood, sluggish
liver, and a great number of disorders such as headaches, nervous debility,
afiymia, loss of energy, and even diseases of a chronic and dangerous
nature. If you are troubled with this really serious complaint do not
regard it as a light matter, and remember that the cure may be surely
and speedily effected by means of

Did You Ever
tSacK a Man for
Inefficiency ?
There are few employers who haven’t done so. They
don’t like doing it, hut efficiency is the great factor in
modern business life. And just as you dispense with
the services of inefficient men, so should you dispense
with baek-date machinery. You won’t like letting it
go,, but it’s real economy to d® so, and substitute the
fast, efficient tools of to-day.
When vou look closely into the earning powers of
your machine tools —see bow much they produce and
how much they cost to run —yob’ll find the reason
why your competitor has been getting in ahead of you
on orders. He has the latest machines—you are
struggling on with a handicap that no man can hope
to carry.
Write our expert about it to-day. That costs, nothing,
and you will get the latest facts about high-speed

and how yon can pay for them. Will you write soon?
