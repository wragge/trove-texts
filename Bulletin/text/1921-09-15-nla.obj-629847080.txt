The Truth
Behind the idiocy of Whistler’s famous
“Art doesn't copy Nature; Nature copies
Art” there is a shadowy truth—just enough
to make the abominable phrase bearable if
not enough to make it reasonable. Exam-
ined, the shadow behind Whistler’s motley
would seem to pan out something like this.
The profusion of Nature is too great
and tumultuous to show its whole mean-
ing ; the overlapping ideas and motives
obscure the picture. Art, singleminded
and abrupt, ruthlessly cuts away all con-
fusion, sacrificing insignificant truth to
significance of expression. Hence, Art’s
is the better picture—Art is greater
than Truth—and Truth would do well to
copy her. That seems to be about the
Strength of the phrase. Some years of seek-
ing have not yet shown me satisfactorily
any instance wherein Nature docs copy Art,
but that may be rny shortsightedness, or pos-
sibly it is one of Whistler’s personal - sacri-
fices' of Truth on the altar of Wit.
In ordinary practice the notion hangs to-
gether firmly enough. One finds that a cor-
rect photographic description is a damnably
incorrect and feeble literary presentment.
Three luminous sentences thrown on paper
while you glance casually at the subject will
do the job much better—or, rather, will do
it: the meticulous catalogue can’t do it. It’s
too busy feeding on its own interlocking
coils to bother with expression. The notion
is consistent with fact, too. Exactness is
not the writing-man’s business; his task is
to transfer to his paper the act of a reader
looking at and not examining a subject. This
he must do to the limit of his literary
expressiveness, whose soul is brevity. The
fewer words the more instantaneous and,
therefore, vivid the impression, given that
the words are all or nearly all significant.
Even the shorter the words themselves the
better. Then if the reader does care to
examine the thing he lias looked at lie will
find that the catalogue has been supplied
by # bis own imagination. The art of letters
being rather the suggesting than the telling
of thb truth.
Yet great names exist in literature solely
by their telling of the bare truth. St. Augus-
tine was no literary artist, but his “Con-
fessions," the careful listing of his scruples,
temptations, sins, desires, even his small
faiths and unfaiths, make a tremendous liter-
ary picture whose expressive power comes
undiminished over nearly 1(5 centuries. There
is the man, the complicated, zealous, sensual,
struggling being, over-educated but keen, full
of red life but pursuing ceaselessly the white
file of the spirit. In the pages he speaks to
me as vividly as if .he were the greatest
of all literary artists sitting by my side.
Yet he has nothing in his mouth save the
plain, colorless truth.
Benvenuto Cellini, by the medium of an
unvarnished autobiography of a quarrelsome,
spiteful megalomaniac, writes an ’illuminat-
ing note on mediaeval sociology. At his 400
years’ distance it is hard to separate abnor-
mal vanity from strict truth. His reports
of the dramatic effect of his sculpture and
metal-work on the various princes lie worked
for are probably as exaggerated as his re-
ports of his own dramatic effect in society.
But here and there lie confesses the man Cel-
lini stripped naked of his reactions on his
surroundings; and by these pages of simph
truth the book is alive. 1
Samuel Pepys, the Admiralty official, told
the truth, too, in that diary of mue years
which his defective eyes made him stop.' The
shorthand MS. which was deciphered more
than a century after his death is the best
picture of the Court of Charles 11. in the
language. Of inestimable literary and his-
torical value and full of strong, pungent
expression, there is nothing whatever artistic
in it. It is no more than the record of the
merest truth.
In 1782 Rousseau did. also posthumously,
a similar thing. Palliating nothing, coloring
nothing, he set himself down on his paper as
be was, sensitive, impulsive, crapulous, back-
boneless. lie tells me of a mean theft foi
which he blamed a maid-servant who was
sacked for it. He allowed his mistress to be
known as his mother while lie lived in her
house and on her income. He wantonly left
the marriage-lines out of his first relations
with Ther&se le Vasseur. and sent their
five children to the Paris Foundling
Hospital as expensive' encumbrances. When-
ever the wind of calumny blew in his direc-
tion (and it often did) he ran away.
Throughout his wretched, harassed, spas-
modic life he almost always chose the wrong
aud often the despicable thing to do. lie
cadged the protection and, the food of some-
body else from the beginning to the end ; not
once does be seem to have stood on his own
feet. All this with a true air of sincere sor-
row he points out to me squarely and fairly,
without one hint of the sumptuous artist who
wrote “The New Heloi'se” and “Emile,” or
of the supple casuist of the “Contrat Social.”
The “Confessions” are miserably, hopelessly
true, and worth most of the fiction over-
written.
Marie Bnshkirtseff was a painter who
died in her 2(>th year, leaving her “Memoirs.”
Her pictures are all forgotten, but this record
of her life, her passionate jealousies, the use-
less littleness of her poignant sufferings, re-
mains now as her contribution to mortal
thought. Here in defiant, triumphant truth
is herself as really as if she had not died
early or late.
Newman’s “Apologia pro Vita Sua” is a
clear, vital record of the gradual growth of
faith in a man’s heart. It is not a confes-
sion of moral instability or of the passing
slips of a bodily journey, but it states in un-
mistakable truth the movement from doubt
to final religious certainty in the mind of a
man. The drawn-out, rather poor style does
its best to keep the book on the literary level
of “The Dream of Gerontius,” but the quiet
sanity of its truth drives it up into its real
place.
Last and best, Bar hellion, who died about
two years ago, left a bitter, tragic truth
behind. “The Journal of a Disappointed
Man” is surely on the same level as Rous-
seau’s “Confessions.” It is the heart-break-
ing record of a brave man watching his fast-
approaching death. Here is his changing
mind, the hopes that came and went, the
cruel misfortunes and unhappinesses which
were borne and overcome. Here in print is
a man dying of paralysis and driving his
failing energies to get down this truth be-
fore Death snatches the pen. Death won
when Barbellion was just 30, when the men-
tal life runs at its highest and best, so his
thoughts are worth hearing. But far above
their worth shines their inviolable truth.
Only twice in my reading have I found this
all-embracing truth, in Rousseau and in Bar-
bellion ; and the two names are surely of
equal literary value.
So, if I am right, if these plain l'ecords of
events can be drawn out of literature and
stood up as the best and most lasting
examples of that colorful, exuberant craft,
then the whole theory of selective art is
wrong. The sensitive picture of high signi-
ficant lights is a secondary thing, like an old
man singing his remembered joys and forget-
ting his sorrows, an old man not to be taken
too seriously. True art must surely be a
young man with no memory, no technique,
no tradition, no equipment save the Truth,
the whole Truth and nothing but the Truth.
HILARY LOFTING.
Goethe
There is a story of Victor Hugo which 1
will continue to believe though you bring
10 legions of angels to prove its falsity.
The place of Goethe in the hierarchy of
genius was under discussion. "He was a
monster,” said Hugo; “a brute; he never
wrote anything worth reading except ‘The
Robbers.’ ” Someone among the circle
of worshippers plucked up sufficient courage
to falter that “The Robbers” was written
by Schiller, not Goethe. “And even that is
Schiller’s!” added Victor with blistering
scorn, and speaking as if he had not heart
the interruption; The members of the
denude thought that the Master did well to
be angry. Was it not this man, this Goethe,
who had the audacity to declare that ‘‘Notre
Dame” was "the most detestable book ever
written”?
Many leaves have fallen from the trees
since these doughty champions hurled mutual
scorn across the Rhine, and Victor has been
vanquished utterly in the critical courts of
Europe. Competent opinion is now con-
sentaneous that, intellectually, Goethe’s
place is by the side of the very greatest
among the sons of men. Morally, how-
ever, the posture of affairs is somewhat dif-
ferent. Here it is not so certain that his
place is not among the least. Dr. George
SaintSbury thinks he may be justly described
as "a rather priggish snob.” A snob he
certainly was- —at any rate, in early youth.
His paternal grandfather was a worthy
tailor, who came from the country to Frank-
fort, and was lucky enough to get a pros-
perous widow to wife. The tailor's father
was a village blacksmith. It is recorded
by Mr. Joseph McCabe that, in his early'
’teens, Goethe carefully examined the family
portraits, if haply he might light upon some
sign that his father was the natural son of
a nobleman, and not a son of the tailor. The
result of his quest, was negative, and he was
acutely disappointed.
Though 1 would not go so far as Lessing
went and say that Goethe “to make a study
would soil the maiden petals of a woman’s
soul,” I would go further—much further —-
than Dr. Saintsbury. I would call Goethe
a moral humbug through and through, if it
were not for the fact that I believe him to
have been ' incapable of judging right from
wrong, in any matter, when his own feelings
or interests were implicated. Working
objectively, Goethe’s intellect was one ol
the wisest ever possessed by mortal man
Subjectively, it seems to have .played tin
part of a kind of Greek chorus to liis acts
and emotions. It gives expression to tin
most exalted moral sentiments the while its
owner is engaged in making love to another
man’s wife or sweetheart; though (and here
we come to a unique feature in Goethe’s
mentality), if the lady in the ease were sc
unreasonable as to take, bin words.and con-
duct at their face value, be would, as likely
as not, have shied like a frightened colt. One
illustration of this may be given. Dili
Schonemann, a clever and accomplished girl
of 16, managed in a most business-like way
to bring matters between herself and Goethe
to the point of a formal engagement. A
common friend, Mademoiselle I>elf, who was
a passionate match-maker, had brought Dili
one evening to the Goethe house. "Take
each other by the hand!” she commanded,
and the lovers obeyed and embraced. Alas!
the course of true love never did run smooth.
Wolfgang not only shied violently this time,
but actually bolted without leave taken.
Goethe seems to me to have discovered very
early in life that he was the possessor of
poetic genius of the highest order, and that
the full development and adequate expression
of this genius was, in some mysterious way.
conditioned by his sex-life. This is the ex-
planation of his innumerable love-affairs. To
produce good work in verse he found it neces-
sary to persuade himself that he was passion-
ately in love. When he had done this he
was able to pour out poetry of surpassing-
loveliness. He could fall in love at will, but,
as to Swift, the thought of marriage was
abhorrent to him. Love-making in nubibuH
never did commend itself to the practical
minds of the fair: and, in the long run, mar-
riage got even with Goethe, as conventional
morality always does get even with those who
flout it. He was bothered by another thing,
too. The poetic value to him of any particu-
lar nymph was never a constant. Always
it waxed, culminated and waned. And fre-
quently the poet was compelled by the failure
of inspiration to be on with the new love a
long time before he was off with the old.
Sixteen ladies have been catalogued, classified
and minutely described, in Germany, as hav-
ing contributed in this way to the develop-
ment of Goethe’s poetic genius. Eight of
these belong to the class A1 —that is. loved
with supreme intensity. Five close attach-

straight and narrow way, and
effectively adopts white stitchery

quaintest little glass buttons of
a dull white glass. A narrow
girdle marks the low waistline,
and the season’s long and grace-
ful tunic is in evidence.
Price - - - - 9 gns.
With this frock is worn a Hat of
black Malines and Chantilly
(H 42).

D2l4.—Dame Fashion be-
comes an Ardent Embroider -
ess this Spring—uses her needle
lavishly—as is proved by this
costume of very heavy Crepe do
Chine of Mastic shade, much
adorned with stitchery of the
same hue. Its big collar and
the novel cut of the front panels
are further claims to favorable
attention.
Price - - - - 11 g gns.
1X289/2. —A Soft and Grace-
ful \V ran in Black Cashmere
de Soie, its sombre tone relieved
with Beige lining, collar and
facings that so aptlv follow
lines of grace a-down the length
of the front. The sleeves are
not so much sleeves as winged
apertures for dainty arms.
Price- - - -£l3/19/6
I)243.—Taflf eta, most modish,
is used for this frock of Navy
shade, and old-gold embroidery
is spread lavisly o’er the plas :

and there on the tunic skirt. A
narrow girdle ties at the back
and the sleeves are the fashion-
able elbow-length.
Price - - - - 11 h gns.
The Chapeau (L4O) is com-
posed of cherry-colored satin,
and the Price is 63/-
1X323/1. —A Wrap to cover
with even greater smartness
the smartest of Spring frocks.
Mole tricolette is the material,

collar is Nigger, to contrast
with the lighter tone of the coat
itself. There are no sleeves —
only slots for arms to emerge.
Price - - - - 10 gns.

essence of smartness in a
frock of Navy Cashmere do

Every woman learns thatdurin
these troublous and expensive
times one of the greatest bless-
ings is good health. She also
learns that to obtain and main-
tain such a condition of health
it is necessary to take care of
herself and keep the system,in
proper working order. Constipation is probably
responsible for most troubles, and if a suitable
medicine is taken as required or, better still, at
regular intervals much discomfort and suffering
will be avoided. For purposes such as this
Dr. Morse’s Indian Root Pills are specially
suited. Every day, women are learning of the
admirable qualities of this medicine and tel ing

PINKETTIS
FOR CONSTIPATION
Constipation is dangerous be-
cause it means that poisonous
materials which should have been
expelled from the body are being
retained. The appetite fails, diges-
tion becomes disordered and the
breath offensive. Pinkettes, the new
laxative, are a real help in correct-
ing constipation.
They do not aggravate the com-
plaint as strong purgatives do; and
they do not wear out in their effects.
Taken according to directions they
assist the patient so that the use of
an opening medicine is not a con-
stant necessity.

They wept outside the quiet death-chamber

That he had passed so suddenly and soon.
“Poor soul!” they suid, “to have died like

Old 'age or sickness warned him, in a

But safe within the coffin lay the wan,
Dead man, at smiling peace, because he wist
The k.nd indignities they put upon
Senility and suffering he had missed.

Forest Morning.
•Hew to the long grass clinging,
Scent of the good brown earth,
And out o’er the hills, upswinging,
The Red Road wandering, flinging
Its lure to the brave Vs ever
It lured since the world had birth i
Out of the whisp’ring green seas
onu-vo.de, watvci.n.g, thrills,
And a stream o’er the rough rocks falling
In its swift nace pauses, calling
To the chanting voice, insistent,
Of a stream in the higher hills.
God walks in the woods at dawning,
And even the pines forget
Their sadness awhile, and ever
The soul, for its high endeavor,
Finds hope in the great green spaces
In the marvel of morning set.

Eros.
Perhaps, in the iworld’s dawn, I laid red
roses
Before your perfect, white, smooth marble
feet.
(Oh, glossy-dark the myrtles pressed about
you!
The moan of doves, the drone of bees was
sweet!)
I have a memory of processional triumphs—
How, o’er our heads, the wings of freed
birds flashed,
(While dancers leapt, and tambourines were
smitten,
And golden-loud the kissing cymbals
clashed.
Oh, vanished morning unowned 'with opal
radiance,
When every spring-time hillslope knew its
god,
And the wild violet changed earth to heaven,
Where some half-glimpsed, bare-limbed
Immortal trod!
Oh, Eros, Eros! You were winged and lovely,
A foam-white, flawess youth, brow-bound
with gold!
How slight the thorns that mingled with
your blossoms
In those dawn-years before the world was
old!
(Do you remember, my eternal lover,
The deep warm shade of the Arcadian
pine,
The sunrise Are that made each summit
holy *
When first your mouth was wedded unto
mine ?)
The world’s day broadened, gloomed with
clouds and thunder,
Gi - ew rich with agony and sharp with
strife ; " )
The fair, pale Venus-temple stood deserted,
For now .Love walked the dusty walks of
life.
Oh, He was pitiful beyond all pity!
His healing hands restored the blinded
sight,
And the dead rose like flowers breaking'sun-
ward,
When April strews the valleys with
delight.
(Do you remember, my eternal lover,
How, in the street of a Judaean town;
Where halt and maimed waited the Healer’s
passing,
You knelt among the rest and laid me
down :)
No roses hid the altar-stone before Him;
No clustering myrtles made a darkness
sweet;
The tree whereon He hung was stark and
leafless,
And iron nails were through His hands
and feet.
Where a wdiite youth had drawn his bow
for pleasure,
A wmimded man hung crucified for pain..
Oh, hills once trodden by the glad immortals,
Will that first rapture ever come again?
“I shall return,” He said, and every sun-
set
Whose fires transfigure the o’erwearied
day
I.s as an angel on our paths descending
That we, who worshipped Love, may hope
and pray.
Like a diviner dawn that second coming
Shall surely diadem our saddened hills,
As when the western wonder-light outflow’ng
With molten gold each winding valley fills.
Then each behind the eyes of man or woman
Shall see the wondrous, thorn-crowned,
prisoned God,
And know the very dust upon the threshold
As sacred as the ways tne Healer trod.
Oh. Eros. Eros! God of joy and sorrow,
Of the dark earth and of the radiant skies,
You will return when we by heart have
mastered
That- each must find You in the other’s
eyes.

THE SECOND-BIGGEST CARBUNCLE
IN THE EMPIRE.
“If our Sydney continues to grow as fast as during
the last decade, in five or six years she must have
the honorable place among British cities as next,
though distant, to London The present status
of Sydney is all the more wonderful when it is re-
membered.... Its marvellous giowth and evidently
great future the pardonable pride in the splendid
position as fourth in the Empire that she has now
attained.” —Letter in S. M. HRrald entitled “Sydney,
the Fourth City in' the Empire,” by Archdeacon
Boyce.
Some census figures about the big cities of
England moved the reverend gentleman, who,
after all, is no lonesome freak, but the in-
carnation of the One Big City spirit of
Australia. His figures are not quite right,
for the existence of Calcutta and Bombay
makes Sydney only the sixth crowded spot
of the Empire, but it is at least the fourth
among white cities, following Ixmdon, Glas-
gow and Birmingham. Ten years ago it was
eighth instead of sixth, and Melbourne was
ninth, whereas it is now seventh, so the
process of congestion moves fast. If the
name of Sydney covered as many square
miles as the name of Melbourne or Adelaide,
the N. S. Wales metropolis would stand even
higher than it does, which means that the
rest of the big State, which is desolate
enough already, would be still more empty
and the Archdeacon would have still
reason for pride. But the way in which
Svdney and in a less degree other Austra-
lian cities grow nowadays is a way of their
own. In other countries cities expand in
groups. In an Australian State only one
place grows; the others either petrify or
wither. In other countries a city doesn’t
grow by eating up the countx-y and the small
towns, and though places get bigger they
don’t get noticeably bigger nowadays in pro-
portion to the whole population of the
country. Here it is an octopus or cannibal.
In 1881, out of every 10.000 N.S.W. neople,
3054 lived in the Big City and 0940 else-
where in the State. In i 921 Sydney had
4275 and the rest of the State only 5725.
Glasgow, with a shade over 21 per cent, of
Scotland’s population (not 42:| per cent, like
Sydney), is the shocking example of the
British Isles and one of the shocking ex-
amples of the world outside this continent,
this continent being in a category by itself.
But Glasgow doesn’t plot and scheme to
debar Leith, Dundee. Aberdeen or Greenock
from having railways to bring the t’-ade of
their hinterland to them. And it made itself
by hard, grimy work—not by being a centre
nf borrowing and political corruption. If
the six biggest cities of England (Greater
London. Birmingham, Liverpool, Manchester,
Sheffield and Leeds) are added together they
stand for only 30 per cent, of England’s
population, so that 70 per cent, are left to
“devo'on” (that is the orthodox word) the
other 50.000 square miles. 111 N. S. Wales a
mere 57 per cent, are left to develop 309,000
square miles. '
The method adopted to produce the results
which excite the good Archdeacon's admira-
tion is beautifully simple, also beautiful'v
in’ouOous, Svdney and Newcastle nr» the
only N. S. Wales ports connected with the
interior by railwavs; and Newcastle is only
enuipped tor handling coal—its own coal. So
Sydney is the one port for gene-al exnert
and import, northern produce being railed
past Newcastle for an extra 100 m : ies to
reach the capital at a cost of anything up
to 12s. per ton. Some really wonderful re-
sults follow. The following are the dis-
tances as accurately as they con he mea-
sured on the map from a few typical towns
to the ports wh’eh they would h'ke to use
for oversea trading and the distances to
the one they have to use: —

When it is remembered that these super-
fluous distances, which four short new con-
nections would remedy, affect traffic both
ways, and that freights are steadily going
up (to say nothing of the rise of wages, the
doubling of State taxation and the increase
of Federal burdens), it is no wonder that
the producer is getting off the land no mat-
ter how hard and expensively he is pushed
on to it. The Ma State must grow th ngs
for export—enormous and increasing masses
of things—if it is to pay interest on its.
foreign debt and keep solvent. But it soon
won’t attempt to grow things for export ex-
cept in a narrow area round the city. At
one time, before wages went up and there
were two big income-taxes and two husky
land-taxes ard so many strikes, it might
have been possible for the remote person to
comfortably pay freight for ”89 needless
miles or 778 miles on the double journey.
It isn’t so now. Neither big lpans nor big
repatriation schemes based on more lo>ns
can make up for the fact that the One B'g
Oitv policy, in a place the size of any Aus-
tralian mainland State, is a fight aga nst
arithmetic and geography and the arrange-
ments of Providence. A metropolis which
has to suck the blood of so large an area
to live, and even then only lives by the
grace of the money-lender, cannot be an en-
during proposition.
* * * *
The fact that the Church doesn’t raise its
voice in fierce protest makes some people
despair of its sense and others of its Chris-
tianity. Sydney, as the must populous of
this country’s great capitals, yet the one
with least area to stand on, is developing, or
has developed, the slum element to a degree
that is amazing considering its youth and
the abundant space there is in the State
without putting people in dens and lanes
and alleys. Revolnt ons grow in slums, and
unbelief, and vice, and illegitimate chi'dren.
and dirt and ugliness and disease, and bad
language. But Christianity doesn’t —or
does only with great difficulty. Fam-
ilies reared where there is room to
breathe and cultivate the decencies of life
don’t always rise in the moral and sniritual
scale, but' those who live of necessity too
many in a room and sleep on compulsi m too
many in a bed fall almost as a matter of
course. Further, there is the same diffi-
culty about reconstructing a city which
travels at Sydney’s pace as there is about
putting new shoes on a galloping horse. The
slum tenements can’t be pulled down because
there is no place to put the tenants during
the rebuilding process: the narrow streets
can’t be adequately widened w’thout spread-
ing the place over too much ground so that
the outliers can’t get to the ; r work. In ary
case, when there are so few people outside
the capital to hCn pay for the rehabilßoU'on
of the capital, little can be done. And the
deliberate bleating of one great city hasn’t
even the sordid merit of producing revenue,
for the railway deficit this year is expected
to be nearly two millions.
The setting up of new States is the one
practicable remedy. N. S.,Wales is so curiously
thrown together that the bulk of it is nearer
to some other capital than triiits own. Every-
thing north of Kempsev on one line and
Armidale on the other belongs to Brisbane
if it can’t belong to a capital and seaport
of its own; and when Queensland straightens
out the great kink in its southern railway
the dividing or secession line will be well
south of Arnrdale. Everything south of
Junee and including that town belong, by
geography and the act of God. to Melbourne
if it can’t get its own State capital and a
port at Eden. Mcnindie on the Darling is
closer to Melbourne and far closer to Adel-
aide than to Sydney. The territory which
belongs by the deed of Gon to the N.S.W.
metrooolis mav he big enough to supnort
tbe 12th city of the Empire, which is about
all that Canada! aims at, but even, that is
doubtful. So when the North and South are
tired of being harried, levied on and impover-
ished to make the artificial density of Wool-
loomooloo, or become too poor to pay for
Woolloomooioo, there will be readjustments.
The sooner they come the better, not only
for the country districts, but for Sydney as
well. It is madness for a city to be content
to be a vast mushroom on a stalk that every
year becomes less capable of supporting the
weight.
THE FRIEND OF ANARCHY.
“The secretary of the Westralian Alliance, speak-
ing at a Perth meeting of the W.C.T.U., caused a
sensation by declaring that prohi’ ition was a failure
in America. Several irate prohibitionists warmly
countered the statement, declaring that it was en-
tirely without foundation.”— Sun.
If prohibition has anywhere kept those with
money from getting drink the place has yet
to be indicated. Of course there are spots
where the poor are successfully prohibited ;
and it is to this limited extent that the
policy may be said to be successful. But
the counterbalancing evils are enormous, and
one of the worst of them is set out in a
recent issue of Collier’s Weekly. The
writer of the article “On Sale Everywhere”
is Samuel llopkins Adam®, who was one
of the notable Committee of One Hundred
which did much to secure the adoption of
prohibition during the war. Collier’s has
always been an enemy of the American liquor
interests, and it is now. The ideal of both
contributor and newspaper is stated to be
to secure “an honest and concerted effort
to enforce the fprohib’tlonl law as it now
stands.” Here are some cited instances of
the need for concerted effort:—
Most of those who drank when it was lawful con-
tinue to drink now that it is unlawful, and without
any consciousness of moral or ethical deterioration.
Home brewing or purchase in bulk has succeeded
to bar haunting as the source of steady supply, and
the pocket flask to the punch bowl for social fes-
tivities.
The tendency has been away from beer and wine
and toward whisky and gin. Quick results are the
desideratum.
A new, large and highly specialised class of crim-
inals has developed the boot-legging industry, to a
great extent ig ored bv the authorities a>d to a
greater extent patronised and abetted by the class
which is generally regarded as “our best citizens.”
It may reasonably be doubted if there is
much to hope from concerted action seeing
that no more success than this has been won
in the enthusiastic early years of the experi-
ment. And meantime the Americans are
being intensively trained in anarchy.
When the Russian revolution followed the
prohibition of vodka many eonviviaxists de-
duced that it was an example of direct cause
and effect; and they argued that if West-
ern Europeans or Americans were robbed of
their beer they wouxd protest in the same
way. The reasoning was at fault. Complete
prohibition, where xt is possible to bring it
to pass, appears to exasperate very few,
though it is distasteful to very many, it
was made effective on some A.I.F. transports
during the war, and on these ships there was
no particular discontent. But the Diggers
became annoyed and directed their best
efforts to flout the order wherever they
observed that u was beix.g enforced against
them and not (say) against the C.O. troops
or his adjutant. Now, the senior officer who
took an occasional whisky always did it
for the best. He needed it. It helped him
with his arduous duties. He knew that he
was a temperate man who could be trusted
not to exceed. Tne Russian Grand Dukes
and merchant princes who went on importing
the pick of France’s sweet champagne after
the peasants had been denied vodka no doubt
argued along similar lines. And so, judging
by the results, did an immense proportion
of those who favored prohib'tion in the
U.S.A. They thought it would be a good
thing for somebody 61se; but, unless the
testimony of the past couple of years is un-
true, they never intended it to apply to
themselves. Wherever prohibition is at-
tempted outside an army, this condition of
affairs is found. The way it works out in
a h ghiy civilised community such as America
is that very few obey the law except those
who are teetotallers for preference and an
insignificant minority of alcoholists without
money or initiative. In consequence prac-
tically the whole nation is more or less satis-
fied. The Russian, lacking the educated
American’s adroitness in law-evasion, being
unable in . many cases to get hold of the
raw material for the manufacture of vodka,
and not knowing in other cases how to make
vodka, could only sit dawn and curse the
rich and powerful for what must have seemed
to him the most complete example of “the
oppressor’s wrong, the proud man’s con-
tumely” on record. Unfortunately for
Ozarism it drove him not to suicide n ac-
cordance with the Shakspearean tradition,
but to murder. So that an effect of prohibi-
t-on is to encourage either sudden ard violent
anarchy as in Russia, or the milder and
more gradual variety of the article which
even prohibitionists now admit to be rife in
America.
■» * * *
There is only one corrective, and that is
a workable device for preventing millionaires
from getting whisky. Pending its discovery
—and on the authority of “On Sale Every-
where” there is no hint or trace of such a
thing in America so far —it is very much to
the point to consider the dangers of going
any further in the creation of lawbreakers.
In this country more than enough has been
done in laying people onen to be nroseeuted
for acts which no normal human being w'll
recognise as criminal. It is a police-court
affair not to be on the electoral roll. Scores
of people—almost invariably of the poorer
classes—are arrested every' week for play-
ing games of chance, although thousands —
usually of the richer classes —do the same
things in clubs and elsewhere and think
nothing of it. A section of the public makes
bets running into £25,G00 000 a year on privi-
leged spots, which are frequented by Gov-
ernors, Judges and so forth, with the satis-
faction of know'ng that it is participating in
the Sport of Kings. Another section bets
on the same horses at the same odds in a
tobacconist’s shop and becomes Gable _ to
arrest. Like muffli of our auti-gamhliug
legislation, prohibition is largely unenforce-
able. In the U s A. detectives. special
constables and informers h‘”p f> m lll< 'ir>l’od hv
the thousand, and the results achieved are
negligible. the real reason being that people
pm-o not made ashamed of having a
drink. Whether they could be made
ashamed in the course of years is a suF. r
for speculation- but, anyhow, it w , .
Plainly be necessary for the ’wealthy
the privileged to give the nation a lead in
this direction, and keep on doing it \
present the rich are not doing it anywhere
llie less fortunate financi-allv are not likeP
to permanently admit a right on the part of
the affluent to pick and choose in the matt -
of the laws they will obey; they will i ns i st
that it may be harder for a hungry member
of the unemployed to refrain from stealine
h:s dinner than for another to forego drink
with his dinner.
PATROLLING IN PAPUA.
I walked towards the wharf down one of the
prettiest paths in Papua. It was late in
May and the ground was strewn with
fallen petals of scarlet and cream hibiscus
and the high ly-saen ted frangipani. Step-
ping into a long, rakish-looking canoe,
manned by half-a-dozen native police, I
bade good-bye to the primitive comforts of
the little island outpost, and steered a course
down the bay towards the Gwou*u Kiver. And
as i went I wondered how many of the
people of me Comyjunweaxiu knew now then-
rep.tsencauves m me outposts lived, and
wnat Kaul 01 jobs they had to undertake.
in tne despatcu-box were warrants for
the arrest or a sebre of men who bud given
plantation life best in obedience to the call
of nome. Their rnuemures wun the. planters
had taued to hold them, and the penalties
provided for breaking mem had carried no
vveignt: tney nail s.mpiy left the luboer or
tne cocoanuts to look utter themselves, Clink-
ing Ltue and caring less about tne trouble
tneir emp.oyers would nave in currying on
Witnout labor. Their apprehension was one
of the items that were taking me into the
Cxwoira Mountains, said b.y the few who
know them to be the roughest in Papua.
1 had the absconders’ names, or their
aliases, and I knew that they all lived “some
where in tne mountains,” in some instances,
too, I actually had the names of the.r vil-
lages, or ht least the villages they gave as
thea-s when signing on. Casting a dubious
eye over the Lst, i saw that one or two of
these were 1U or 12 days inland. A long
job; yet it might have been longer, for then-
are villages even beyond Deawa. I took a
grain of comfort out of that because my work
wou.d finish there. So at least l thought.
An American journalist came to this country
recently, and after living on an outpost for
a while he guessed many th.ngs, and one was
that a Papuan magistrate must be a cross
between a philosopher and an antelope, "be-
cause,” he draw led, “when he is not unravel-
ling the tangled skein of his slender finances,
he is ehasmg natives over spurs and preci-
pices that would break the heart of a goat.”
He, poor fellow, fainted wnen he iookeu over
one of them unexpectedly ; but lie has gone
back now to Chicago.
Attached to the warrants was a list of 30
names of men who had died while working on
the plantations or in the mines. The wages
due to them under the.r indentures at tne
time of death had been sent to me for distri-
bution among their next-of-kin. There is no
use for money in the wild ranges of the
Gwoira, so I had purchased a motley of
things a native loves most. My journey
therefore had a double purpose.' 1 had to
chase those who had taken what our fathers
called French leave, and give unto the wives
and mothers of those who had fallen victims
to an outbreak of dysentery the tinsel for
which they had come down from the hills.
I don’t know which of the two tasks is to be
preferred.
After 1.4 days we were marching, with a
dozen or more deserters secured on a light
chain, through the beautiful valley of the
Nauwatoga, 5000 ft. above sea level. At some
villages the folks gave up the wanted men,
or told us dispassionately how we might get
to where they were hiding; at others they
gave no sign. Still, they were never hostile.
1 went among these valley folk to take away
here a son, here a husband, there a father,
to serve a term in prison and then complete
their indentures. If that was not my quest,
then there was a list of dead men always in
my pocket, and the parcels of trade goods
in the swags. I had no glad tidings of any
sort to bring them ; yet thev treated me well.
Each evening in that valley brought to my
camp a group or shivering men or women,
carrying firewood and food, unsolicited, for
myself and police and carriers. Some of
them had sons at work on plantations hun-
dreds of miles away, and they came to know
the worst. They knew well enough the pur-
pose of my visit; so well, in fact, that one
old lady, dressed only in a cloak of beaten
bark, was shedding untimely tears: she had
taken it for granted that her son was among
the dead.
“Is the mother of Bagoi here?” the inter-
preter would shout to*the crowd around us.
“No; she lives at the village on that spur
over there.” And one would hurry away to
break the sad news and bring the old dame
down to collect the fruits of her son’s toil.
If the man’s death did not occur until, say.
the tenth or eleventh month of his indenture,
there would be a big parcel to deliver; but
where it occurred in the first or second montn
the bundle of goods would be woefully small.
This sometimes was hard to explain, but the}
never complained; they usually went away
into the dusk with the evidences of their mis-
fortune tucked under their arms —unspoken
doubts in their minds and grief in their
hearts. One old fellow came to gather a
solitary garden knife —his son had died a
month after signing on. Handing it to him
the interpreter said, “Father, grieve not.
the knife is a good one and will bring muc
food to your mouth.” “True enough, saia
the old man. Then, as he hobbled away-
“ But it won’t bring back my son.’
From the valley we turnpd eastwards am
crossed the Gwanauru spur in quest of more
deserters. It was on this mountain tna
Werner was killed in 1014. ignoran
were his murderers of the ways of civili -
t ; on that they thought his boots were pa
of his body, and boiled them too, bi
thev were of the cossack type, and proved
entirely ined'ble. Pursuing our way st_«
eastwards over' cardboard mountains and
razor-like spurs, we added daily to
string of prisoners and responsibilities £
at tbe tlrrd week there was still a qesertei
bent on giving us as long a cuase as PO-— w •


Hearing' of him at one village we would
walk, crawl or scramble there, according to
its location, only to find that Utam had gone
somewhere else, always deeper into the heart
of the mountains. Finally we heard that
he had left his country altogether and was
hiding at a dace called Biniguni, wherever
that was. If we asked, we were always tola
to go ! go! go!—and a wave of the hand to-
wards the peaks of Mount Dayman com-
pleted the information. It sounded a long
way off, and very vague, too: but it was an
indication, and at times a Papuan patrol-
officer is thankful t<» get even that. For the
good of his soul and the white Government’s
prestige Utam simply had to be arrested,
and therefore we would follow him to Bini-
guni or any other place he dared to go.
Picking up his tracks we pursued him for
four long days on short commons, over vil-
lainous country, until we found ourselves
scaling Dayman itself. Utam was making
a bold bid for his liberty when he tackled
this 10,000 ft. mountain, to say nothing of
the wilderness around it. I could have be-
lieved we were on a false scent. Reaching
the summit of the mountain on the fourth
morning, however, we saw the ashes of a
fire he had made, and there, too, was his
trail, undisguised, in the deep frost-covered
moss. Evidently it. had not occurred to
Utam that we would follow him into such
country, and he had climbed to that great
altitude comforted by that delusion. Far
below us, a black dot on a great sheet of
glass, was the beautiful island we had
left so many days before, and gazing at it,
teeth chattering with the cold, I longed for
the heat and comfort of the little outpost.
Two days later towards evening, with the
ghosts of malaria at my heels, I walked into
Biniguni, accompanied by only a couple of
men—the remainder of the party were con-
cealed in the hills. The village was almost
deserted, but one old chap, after recovering
from the shock of our appearance, bade us
enter liis house and warm ourselves, for a
cold rain was falling at the time. Squatted
round his fire we smoked the pipe of peace
in silence, and then the old fellow started
to ask questions concerning our visit. Equivo-
cation was the only course, and I was about
to embark on it when the door flew open,
and in strode a very wet native, straight
towards the fire. For two or three seconds
the gloom was kind to us, and then there was
a sudden, fierce tussle. “Utam,” said the
corporal, when he had recovered his breath,
“we have wanted you for many days.”
RICHARD HUMPHRIES.
PLAIN ENGLISH.
The .Moving-Picture Business.
Surrendering to the inevitable squeal from
the importing interest, the Senate, led by
the Foreign-trader Pearce, has requested
the House' of Reps. to let the duty on
foreign films remain at per foot. If
the Representatives are constant to the con-
victions expressed on June 29 they will do
nothing of the sort. Pending an inquiry
into the whole business of foisting imported
pictures (75 per cent, of which, as Blake-
ley, M.H.R., says, are utter rubbish) upon
an indulgent public, they should insist on
the retention of the threepenny duty. That
duty, low as it is, will discourage the im-
portation of the cheaper and nastier produc-
tions of the Yankee “studios,” and help a
struggling but worthy home industry to keep
alive. It will give a small measure of pro-
tection to Australian authors, actors, pro-
ducers, photographers and so forth, and, if
it lessens the annual tribute of Australian
gold to Chaplin, Fairbanks, Arbuckle,
Hcchenstummer, the director, Potztausend,
the sub-director, Bilgewetter, the assistant-
sub-director, and Donnerundblitzen, the
demi-semi-assistant-sub-director, so much the
better. These foreigners and their satellites
have had the loan of the Australian Legis-
lature long enough. They have drawn huge
revenues from the Commonwealth without
paying their fair share of taxation, having
reduced tax-dodging to a fine art. This was
made clear during the tariff debate, and was
one of the reasons which impelled the Repre-
sentatives to double the old impost. It was
shown that the importers of U.S. films paid
duty, not on the value of the goods to them,
but’ on their cost as photographic material.
Thus the tax on a 6000 ft. film would be a
mere £37 10s., and the showman (there are
1000 in Australia) might be charged £5O for
a “first release.” The monstrous unfairness
of this was pointed out by Mahony, M.H.R.,
who urged the Minister to hit the importer
with an ad valorem duty. Greene replied
that lie had considered that, but had found
the difficulties insurmountable :
In the first place none of these films, so far as I
can learn, are purchased outright. There are some
for which certain definite sums are paid, but other
arrangements are entered into which make it almost
impossible to arrive at the ad valorem duty which
should be paid on any of the films. Sometimes the
film is invoiced at practically the cost of production,
exclusive of the salaries of artists, cost of staging,
etc. In addition to this, however, certain royalties
are charged in the form of a lump sum, usually from
three to four cents per foot. In a second method
the film is invoiced at cost, and a percentage of tne
gross takings is remitted to America. This is the
usual method when the Australian purchaser is a
branch house of an American company, the percen-
tage remitted to America being about 65 per cent.
In the case of some companies, the parent houses of
which are in America, the film is invoiced at cost,
and all profits are remitted to the parent house. It
is practically impossible to arrive at the ad valorem,
duty of films when the business is handled in those
ways.
It was in the hostile mood excited by these
disclosures, which illustrate how easy it is
for the Yankee film-man to pull an Aus-
tralian Government’s leg, that the ' Repre-
sentatives decided upon the ificreased duty.
Thereupon the importing interest issued its
usual piercing lament (no section of the
community squeals louder or more fre-
quently) preparatory to passing on the in-
crease with the customary plus, although
Australian pictures are not taxed and the
penny-a-foot on the British article was left
untouched. If the House backs down when
the item comes on again it will stultify itself.
The only amendment that should be consid-
ered is one to levy duty on the real value
of films to the importer (with extra-stiff
penalties for misrepresentation) and not on
their cost as celluloid. An honest ad valorem
duty would protect the country from a lot
of the sickening piffle and pornography with
which its picture-screens are now flooded.
It would give an impetus to the production
in Australia and Britain ot interesting
scenic and industrial pictures and dean
little human comedies, which woo d be tar
more entertaining to a healthy-minded public
than American slop. When the House goes
back to work Mahony intends to move that
various sinister aspects of the picture busi-
ness should be investigated. It is a pro-
posal which deserves support—certainly no
industry is in greater need of investigation.
The House in Order.
Fkom many quarters come tales of stern
economy instituted by peoples and Govern-
ments which realise that war wages and war
expenses and war extravagances can t keep
up now that war prices are quite gone. I Ue
putting of the national house in order is a
matter that must be faced after every great
upheaval. The choice lies between doing it
ourselves as sane and responsible human
beings should, or waiting till an armed enemy
comes to do it like the Turks of Angora, or
leaving matters to death and the Devil
and the spectre of famine, as in crazed and
horror-haunted Russia. The British Govern-
ment sets an example by cutting down its
own salaries —a thing that (wonderful as it
may sound now) was once done here when
Gecbgic Turner was the strong, honest man
of Victoria. Yet Britain didn’t put up
salaries during the war-boom after the
manner of some gay political borrowers and
adventurers ill Australia. In fact, two-
thirds of the members of the British Govern-
ment struggle with allairs of Empire for less
than the wage which .lon x _ Storey values
himself at without even taking a portfolio.
Also the .British member (£4OO a year and
no free pass) works for much less than half
the wage of the N. S. Wales M.H.A., and the
British Upper House has neither salaries nor
free pusses. In the same week that this
Ministerial retrenchment was announced
100.1100 British railway men agreed to a
wage reduction of (is. per week, because there
is no loan fund to carry the gigantic loss,
and the tax fund, in a country which is
reducing old debts instead of piling new
liabilities sky-high, can’t carry it. It was
further announced that heavy wage-reduc-
tions affecting 300,000 British civil servants,
100,000 municipal employees, 700,000 building
workers and 500,000 agricultural laborer*
begin, this month. If Britain had pad off
no old debts but had borrowed and spent on
public works during the year £350,000000
of new cadged money, which would have been
as much per head as N.S.W. scattered, the
trouble might have been postponed, but it
would only be worse when it came —as it
will be here. News of similar wage-reduc-
tions arrives constantly from the United
States. The U.S. worked hard during the
war to make hay while the sun shone, and
reached such a giddy pinnacle of vanity that
it began to tell wild tales about every worker
turning up at his iob in his own motor-car,
but all the same it has sense enough to realise
the new situation. The Government refuses
to borrow £700.000.000 a year (the N.S.W
scale) to keep the myth of universal wealth
afloat, and all the globe couldn’t lend that
amount even if asked. In South Africa,
where the Federal Government owns all the
railways, the railway deficit for the whole
country promises to be about half as big as
that anticipated in N.S.W. alone under the
44-hours system. So Prime Minister Smuts
has broken the news that the present 48
hours per week must be increased for a while
till tiie worst of the trouble is over—in fact,
that the Afrikander must put his shoulder
to the wheel and rnish. Smuts has no idea
of patching ..the situation with loans. News
from Japan is all to tl-e same effect, and even
M a or Hand, which has had a big surplus, every
year for nearly a d°zen years, is taking in
sail, recognising that the boom is past. Aus-
tralia, or a great part of it, presents, there-
fore, a rather lonesome spectacle, l ; ke a small
but heroic goat butting against the preces-
sion of the eoninoves. when it chooses this
time to demand higher pay. fewer hours, less
production, more sport and a gay time gen-
erally.
The Basic Wage anti the Farmer.
Proceeding the other day to fix a basic wage
for rural industries, the N.S.W. Board of
Trade, or part of it, took occasion to remark
that 30s. a week and found is no sort of
wage for an agricultural laborer and his
family to live on. It isn’t; but the real
problem is how the N. S. Wales farmer can
pay more and still exist. And that brings
us up at. once against the difference between
the conditions under which the N. S. Wales
farmer carries on his business and those
under which the farmer elsewhere works.
Maoriland, for instance, though only one-
third the size of N. S. Wales, has four princi-
pal ports engaged in foreign trade and no
less than 15 minor ones. Therefore the
M.L. producer finds it hard to be more than
50 miles from his outlet. In N. S. Wales,
with one outlet on 700 miles of coastline, it
is easv to be 500 miles away. Then, though
Maoriland has only half N.S.W.’s population
(on one-third of its area), its people are so
much spread out that at last census the b'g-
gest citv outside the capital had 133,700
people ; the second 92,700 ; the third 68,800 ;
the fourth 19,500; the fifth 17,800. N.S.W.
having so much of its population in the
metropolis has little to spare for settlement
outside, so the population of its No. 2 town
at the same date was 58,700; No. 3 was
28,300; No. 4, 12,600, and No. 5, 11800.
Maoriland could be a land of big distances,
of two big cities at most, and of sleepy ham-
lets if it liked to have one port for each
island in the Ma State fashion, but it never
acquired that madness. Further, Maoriland,
because it has a sure rainfall, averages 314
bushels of wheat per acre against Australia’s
record of between 10 and . 11 bushels; and
the cost in wages of getting off a crop
depends quite as much on the acres to be
covered as on the quantity taken off each
acre. Yet with all these advantages Maori-
land didn’t, like Australia, get the crazy
idea that its mission was to send wheat
12,000 or 13,000 miles by sea to compete
in an open market against a nearly-nude
Egyptian, only 2500 miles away from the
same market, and with cheap river instead of
costly rail carriage to start with. It d.du’t
try to nay white men’s wages out of any such
job. Canada and the U.S., with fairly good
yields, straight railways, big navigable rivers
and short sea distances, may do it. Australia
can’t do it. Maoriland doesn’t try. It ex-
ports largely of animal products, as regards
which the almost unclothed and cheap-living
Ganges and Nile person doesn't compete, but
such wheat as the Maorilander grows he
uses in his own small cities and little brisk
industrial towns—the kind of towns which
N.S.W. represses and discourages. When
Massey’s islands tpok their last industrial
census they had, in proportion to populat.on,
twice as many factories as N.S.W’. possessed
at the same time. The number of employees
wasn’t in quite the same proportion, but the
feature of the country was its comparatively
small industries scattered everywhere, not
fewer and bigger ones heaped up in one spot.
In a year like 1915-1916, when almost
exactly 'half of the N.S.W’. wheat crop was a
surplus for shipment abroad, the average
haul that had to be paid for was 200 miles
by land, and when even a 16-bushel crop
had paid for that and the sea-freights then
prevailing, with expenses at both ends, there
wasn’t enough left to give the grower a
fair living over the bad years as well as
the fair to medium, and pay his employees
even 80s. a week and “found. r l he Maori-
land agriculturist, with a flour mill in almost
every town and a market some 40 average
miles away and a 31-bushel harvest, is dif-
ferently situated. If any Board of Trade
can do something in the way of revolution-
ising the N.S.W’. railway system out of all
semblance to its villainous old self and can
replace importers with local manufacturers,
the N.S.W’. farmer will be differently situ-
ated also.

Costs and a Defunct Dean.
On lawyers, modern and ancient: —
I agree with the man who wrote from a dell
court that the speeding-up of tedious Judges and
pleaders would do infinitely more for the Ikigant
than the amalgamation of the legal professions.
Westralia has had the amalgam as far back as I can
remember, and l doubt if anyone would have the face
to Contend that he has given the State cheap law.
When he happens to be a man with an inflated notion
of his own forensic powers and a poor sense of the
value of time and money —your time and your money
—the new system is more expensive than the old.
For instance, I instruct Boogs, of Boggs, Bigos
and Bines, to appear for me. Boggs prepares the
case and undertakes to argue it, but when I go
down to the court there I find Biggs as large as
life. Biggs “takes” an unimportant witness or two
when Boggs has'- exhausted himself by his own ver-
bosity, and blackguards' the defendant (I am the
plaintiff). Possibly Bines is also briefed at my
expense—to read the statement of claim or mani-
cure his finger-nails or see that the turgid Boggs
doesn’t lack for blotting-paper. This variety of
legal joke has been worked in at least a dozen cases
in which I was personally interested and the
economy of it eludes me. Incidentally, for the
shameless stringing-out of cases by pointless objec-
tions, dull irrelevancies and repetitions and stupid
obiter dicta, the courts controlled by two of the
Westralian Judges in my time were in a class of
their own.
Horn Grey’s idea that any citizen should be
allowed to plead in the courts. would have scan-
dalised a retired genius of the Westralian Bench.
That worthy once rated a poor devil who announced
that his circumstances compelled him to conduct
his own case; ’s’Onah was clearly of opinion that
a low beggah who couldn’t afford to fee counsel
had no right to go to law. But the idea in
question didn’t originate with the great old pro-
consul: it is at least as old as Dean Swift. Swift’s
celebrated satire on the law has by no means lost
its force. Stripped of its savage attacks on the
probity of eighteenth-century barristers and Judges
it is remarkably applicable to the conditions of
which several Bulletin contributors have written.
In Gulliver’s account of Britain to his Houyhnhnm
piaster: —
I said tHere was a society of men among us bred
up from their youth in the art of provii g bv words
multiplied for the purpose that white is black and
black is white, according to how they are paid, lo
this society all the rest of the people aie slaves.
For example, if my neighbor has a mind to my cow,
he hires a lawyer to prove that he ought to have
my cow from me. I must then hire another to
defend my right, it being against all rules of law
that any man should be allowed to speak for him-
self Judges are picked out from the most dex-
terous lawyers who have grown old and lazy.
In pleading, they (the lawyers) studiously avoid
entering into the merits of the cause, but are loud,
violent and tedious in dwelling upon all circum-
stances which are not to the purpose. For instance,
in the case already mentioned, they never desire to
know what claim or title my adversary has to my
cow, but whether the said cow were red or black;
her horns long or short; whether the field I graze
her in be round or square; whether she were milked
at home or abroad; what diseases she is subject to,
and the like. After which they consult precedents,
adjourn the case from time to time, and in 10, 20
or 30 years come to an issue.
It is likewise to be observed that this society has
a peculiar cant and jargon of their own that no
other mortal can understand, and wherein all their
laws are written, which they take special care to
multiply ; whereby they have wholly confounded the
very essence of truth and falsehood, of right and
wrong....ln all points out of their own trade they
are usually the most ignorant and stupid generation
among us’; the most despicable in common conversa-
tion : avowed enemies to all knowledge and learning,
and equally disposed to pervert the general reason of
mankind in every other subject of discourse as in
that of their own profession.
It is just on 200 years since Swift wrote that.
Fudge, the medium, ought to call him up and ask
his candid opinion of a people that allows lawyers
who have vegetatfd a lifetime in their musty
chambers to be the arbiters of wages and hours
throughout a continent, and to fix the price of a
world of commodities from satin underskirts to shins
of beef.
The Two Rich States that Went to the
Devil.
After many years of steady adherence
Peterson, M.L.A., of Queensland, was
moved the other day to send to Premier
Theodore his resignation as a member of the
Government party. There was plenty of
excuse for the gentleman’s secession; and
here is some of it: —
Unemployed per 1000 Workers, not including
Persons on Strike.
End of March, March, March,
1912. 1919. 1920. 1921.
Tasmania . . - . 34 40 36 4S
Queensland .. .. 46 124 105 155
N. S. Wales.. -• 50 56 55 137
S. Australia .. • • 51 35 44 79
Westralia .. - • 5S 57 37 89
Victoria •• •• 67 60 45 8/
When to these are added the strikers in vari-
ous mining fields of N. S. W’ales and Queens-
land, it will have to be admitted that the
condition of what used to be the two richest
States is nitiable enough. N. S. Wales is,
or w r as, first in coal, lead and sTver (in fact,
it has almost a monopoly of supplying them
all), in tin, wheat, sheep, pigs, w r ool and
butter. Queensland, though only a very poor
third in population, with about a seventh of
the total of the Commonwealth, used to
rank fii’st for cattle and copper (it stood
for about as much as all the other States put
together in both cases), horses and cheese,
and ranked second for sheep, wool and coal.
That didn’t leave many first prizes in the
gift of Nature for the less-favored States.
Neither Tasmania nor S. Aus. got one: in
fact, the last and (in its western half) most
barren State had neither a first nor a second
to its credit. Nothing save shocking mis-
government seems to explain the fact that
the two richest States should suddenly ac-
quire the most appalling record for poverty
and misery, while the two poorest ones, but
with a different kind of Government, make the
very best showing. March, 1920, marked the
end of the Holman Cabinet, which the
Dooleys and McTiernans of to-day blame
for leaving behind it a legacy of misery. It
was not much of a Cabinet : yet unless it is
claimed that Federal Statistician Knirbs has
been bribed to falsify the returns, the present
one is to an incredible extent worse.
We, the Crown and the Privy Council.
T. J. Ley, one of those N. S. Wales
M’s.L.A. who make a habit of using the
King for party purposes, did it again in the
Assembly last week in connection with Gov-
ernor Davidson’s (presumably reluctant)
appointment of 10 new Laborites to the
Leg. Council. Further, “I want to say,” he
proclaimed, “that the policy that aims at
taking away the veto of the King of Eng-
land over legislation in Australia is aiming
at the establishment of a republic and the
disintegration of the Empire.” There is no
more vehement opponent of Imperial Fed-
eration than W. M. Hughes. He opposes
it, like most other Imperialists, on the sen-
sible ground that it is likelier to disintegrate
than to consolidate the Empire. For the
same reason he and nearly every prominent
Dominion politician who has investigated
the subject consider that Privy Council ap-
peals have had their day; and a majority of
members of the High Court would seem,
judging by recent events, to agree. As re-
gards what Mr. Ley calls “the policy that
aims at taking away the veto of the King
of England over legislation in Australia,”
there is no such policy and no such aim,
since, fortunately for the stability of the
Empire, that dangerous prerogative no longer
exists. The royal veto has been obsolete in
England since 1092. Dicey notes as a con-
stitutional maxim in his “Law of the Con-
stitution” : “The King must assent to Lor, as
it is inaccurately expressed, cannot vetoj
any bill passed by the two Houses of Par-
liament.” The average schoolboy knows
about “the Sovereignty of Parliament” and
the freedom-loving Britisher’s distrust of the
Byzantinism which ended virtually in Eng-
land with the death of Henry VIII. At in-
tervals attempts have been made to revive
the veto there, the last being in 1780. The
House of Commons knocked it on the head
by affirming, at the instance of Fox and
Burke, “that the influence of the Crown
has increased, is increasing, and ought to
be diminished.” In the Crown Colonies a
right of veto still exists, though it is not, of
course, a King’s veto, but the veto of the
Tvi,r>g-in-Couucil, which is to say of the
British Parliament. But in self-governing
dominions, such as Australia, it has for
several years been as obsolete as the prero-
gative is in the TTnited Kingdom. That sound
Imperialist, Chief Justice Gbteetth. in
Deakin v. Wepu. observed that “it is essen-
tial to the attribute of sovereign tv of any
Government that it shall not be interfered
with by any external Power.” That is the
principle upon which Hughes. Smuts and
the rest stand as between the
nations which thev represent in the Councils
of Empire and the Imperial Government.
And the claim has been readily allowed by
Englishmen, who recognise that it is the best
wav of holding the tremendous concern to-
gether.
Mental Defectives on Trial.
In Sydney last week a jury disagreed in
tne case of Elsie Krause, who was charged
with the murder of her infant son, and she
was remanded to her former custody. Elsie
is only 1(3 now; she is expecting another
child ; and her mother disclosed in evidence
that “she has always been daft.” It may
be reasonably asked, without reference to
her guilt or innocence on the present charge,
whether anything is to be gained by- trying
her afresh. And it is a question that should
be asked because,. amongst other things, she
represents a type. She is not a criminal
even if the Crown’s allegations are correct:
not quite normal even if her version of the
way her babv lost its life is the right one.
Now, the plea that was set up on her behalf,
as in practically all such eases, was “Not
guilty.” Had the jury reached a verdict
the Bench must then have either ordered her
release or passed a punitive sentence. It
is not strange in the circumstances tnat the
jury found it hard to come to a decision. The
Law, with characteristic attachment to prece-
dent,flings in this connection to a number of
conventions which belong rightly to the
Middle Ages or earlier. One is that every
person who does a deed of illegal violence
without plainly showing insanity is a crim-
inal and must be disciplined as such: an-
other that the best people to diagnose cases
of the sort, with all their fine and innumer-
able psychological shades, are a lawyer and
a dozen business or laboring men. And simi-
larly where it is a question of letting loose
on the community one who (as may be
the case with Elsie Krause) is neither a
criminal nor insane, and yet is not fit to
be at large. The Bench makes no bones
about calling in an expert marine assessor
in Admiralty cases, and in England the
Court of Arches has the assistance of the
Bishops in dealing with clerical offenders.
Yet quite recently Mr. Justice Darling
told Sir Robert Armstrong Jones, the
mental specialist, who had intervened in a
murder case, that in his court “they tdok
the law not from Harley-street but from
the Bench.” And that is the judicial attitude
in this part of the world, too. The Krause
case affords a very' good example of the
need for the apnointment in each State of
one or more psychiatric assessors, whose
business it wou lrl be to advise the Judge of
the mental condition of an accused before
him. The present arrangement' is as crude
and unscientific in relation to the victims
it ropes in as it is dangerous to society
in the matter of many of those it lets loose.

The Land of all the Blessings.
When Russia staggers to its grave, except
so much of it as may be saved by the chari-
table interference of capitalistic countries,
it will have the satisfaction of knowing that
it had enjoyed all the essentials of happiness
as defined by Australian Labor Councils,
revolutionists, 0.8.TJ.-ists and such like. It
secured :
Free railways and tramways.
Government paper “secured on the entire public
and private assets of the country,” as all such paper
has always been—only if there isn’t an adequate gold
reserve among the assets things always go to the
deuce. (It is no use asking why this is so, and no
use arguing against it. It comes from the same
cause as that which makes a brick fall down instead
ol up.)
Repudiation of the public debt so that there was
no interest to pay.
Nationalisation of the banks.
Abolition of the capitalist, landlord, profiteer, ex-
ploiter (the commercial one, anyhow) and monopolist;
also of titled persons generally.
Disarmament.
Demobilisation.
Pacifism.
Solidarity.
Job control, including ownership of the workshops
by the workers and extinction of wage slavery.
State ownership when job control didn’t work.
(This went so far as State ownership of the workers
themselves.)
Internationalism and brotherhood and “unity of
the workers.” Internationalism went as far as the
importation of Chinese soldiers and executioners.
Socialistic education.
The nationalisation of the means of production, dis-
tribution and exchange. Certainly production fell
off, for only the Government was authorised to buy,
and it paid in irredeemable paper of little (ulti-
mately' of no) value, so nobody took any interest in
having a surplus, and at last there was famine. Dis-
tribution fell off when the gratis and unrepaired rail-
ways perished. Exchange lagged because the Gov-
ernment (the sole trader) had nothing to sell when
people wouldn’t produce in return for paper and it
couldn’t buy with paper, which was the only thing it
had after the confiscated gold was used up.
Also wages (which seem to have lingered though
wage slavery was abolished) were lavish beyond the
dreams of avarice, but practically worthless.
The people seem to have enjoyed the bless-
ing of Christian burial, till the death-rate
became too fierce, and the hearse horses were
eaten, and it was found cheaper to drown
starving children in the Volga. Only the
lack of a Golden Casket or State lottery
marred the completeness of the picture.
The ship was spoiled for the sake of that
ha’porth of tar.

Labor Demands Something for
Nothing.
In Federal politics hundreds of thousands
of electors who were not unionists supported
the Labor party led successively by J. C.
Watson and Andrew Fisher because it
appeared to be a sincere party, a party with
the courage of its convictions, a logical party.
Its leaders did not offer the Millennium at
the price of an old song. They constantly
stated the disagreeable truth that great
privileges have to be paid for; and their
honesty was rewarded after a time with
office, confidence and public acclamation. By
way of contrast, consider the following from
the agenda paper of the forthcoming inter-
state conference of the A.L.P.: —
The present annual military expenditure of approxi-
mately £3,500,000 to be devoted towards the estab-
lishment of State-owned coal-mines, iron and steel
mills, foundries and State-owned woollen and cotton
mills, for the purpose of absorbing the huge quantity
of raw materials available in this country.
That as militarism is an agent of capitalism the
Labor party shall rigidly work for its complete aboli-
tion in its present form, and the immediate abolition
of compulsory military training and curtailment of
all military* expenditure, by its Parliamentary repre-
sentatives voting for a reduction when all appoint-
ments, salaries, rates of pay or maintenance are under
discussion.
This class of aspiration is not exceptional,
as so many of the agenda proposals admit-
tedly are: it is typical. The policy, or what-
ever it is, may be summarised this way:—
The Australian worker must be awarded a 44-hour
week (or less) and a minimum of 17s. a day. He
must not be brought into competition with low-wage
workers or their products. On the other hand profit-
eering must be stopped, and to this end coal and metal
industries and any others which are doing exception-
ally well must be run by the State for the benefit of
the proletariat. It is true that the owners or part-
owners of many of these concerns are Britishers,
some of whom live here while others live and vote
in the United Kingdom. Let them be expropriated
wherever they are. The interests of the overseas
capitalist cannot be allowed to clash with those of
the self-respecting, upstanding Australian democracy.
The old-time Laborites had the sense to see
the fallacy behind these proposals, and the
courage to indicate it. Pacifism would be
an admirable thing both morally and eco-
nomically if Australia were Prince Albert
Land or some other undesirable spot in the
vicinity of the North Pole. And high wages
and short hours on a basis of expropriation
and indifference to outside sentiment might
be feasible as a national policy if this coun-
try were self-contained. The facts are that
it is a country highly desirable to over-
crowded Asia, and the only thing that
is at present keeping thpse land-hungry
people off and our sea-lines of communica-
tion open is the navy, which is maintained
by the people whose businesses it is pro-
posed to steal.
It has come to light that one of the condi-
tions under which the Commonwealth Sav-
ings Bank and the Queensland State Savings
Bank amalgamated - was that the sum of
£3,086,000 (less some £314,000), representing
assets of the State institution, should be left
in the hands of the Queensland Treasury,
that institution engaging to hand over to
the Commonwealth Bank a “deposit receipt
at call,” and also to pay interest on the
moneys retained at 34 per cent, per annum.
There is a certain crooked ingenuity about
this matter that compels a sort of crooked
admiration. The northern Mica weeks have
skilfully dodged a danger that has more
than once threatened—-a run on the people’s
State Bank. If there be a run at all
it will now be on the Commonwealth
Bank, and Theodore will be able to smile
securely and say “This is not our funeral.”
Which means that N. S. Wales, Victoria.
Tasmania. South A us. and Westralia have
been skilfully saddled with a liability that
must come home to roost, since the honoring
of a “deposit receipt at call” for nearly three
millions is scarcely a possibility in the pre-
sent woeful state of Queensland finances.
The transaction may be e-ood business from
the northern Government’s point of view,
but there is a smell of rotting carcases about
it all.

Bert Brenchley for the defence: —
With regard to prohibition in the U.S.A., one
point that musn’t be lost sight of is that a very
THE ARMY OF THE UNSKILLED.
large proportion of the population was living under
prohibition long before the; national bone-dry law
came into force. In 1914 Washington voted on
the question and by a majority of 18,632 went dry ;
in 1916, after a. two years’ trial, another vote
was taken and the majority in favor of prohibition
increased to 146,556. Kansas Went dry in 1880.
the majority then being 7998. After a trial of
38 years the people endorsed prohibition by a
majority of 424,000. If prohibition is such a
failure, how is it that in every State where a
second vote has been taken the majority in favor
of prohibition has been increased and not one
State has shown even a tendency to revert to wet
conditions? I sympathise with the man who likes
a drop. In fact, it is risky, to suggest come-and-
have-one when I’m within hearing. But in these
days the needs of the nation outweigh the needs
of the individual, and I have conclusive proof that
prohibition has benefited the nation of America. I
believe it would do the same for our country.
Therefore, in spite of my own desires, I am a
prohibitionist.
The same thing would probably be true of
State control: had Kansas adopted it 40
years ago the State might now be swearing
by it as hard as it swears by prohibition. It
doesn’t know the best thing, having tried
only the second-best —-the second-best which,
by the way, British Columbia (Canada)
lately discarded in favor of the best. Inci-
dentally, the prohibitionist commonly as-
sumes that the non-prohibitionist’s hatred
and horror of the drink evil is less than the
bone-dry person’s. The bone-dry person has
no right to that assumption. The liquor-
trade reformer who isn’t a prohibitionist has
mostly two things in his mind: (1) the
desire to. get the most effective reform, and
a reformer that breeds boot-leggers and dope-
fiends and wood-alcohol and home-brew
doesn’t look effective; and (2) the desire to
preserve personal liberty to those who don’t
abuse it. and State control seems to do that
while prohibition certainly doesn’t.
“Cleveland” : Although malaria is preva-
lent along the Mourilyan harbor-line (N.Q.)
a systematic search for malaria parasites
was unsuccessful in the district along each
side of the Johnstone River. On the figures
of the Australian Institute of Tropical Medi-
cine at Townsville,'the fears for the whole-
sale infection of N.Q. lose much of their
terror. From January 1, 1914, till Decem-
ber 31, 1918, there were 1222 admissions to
the tropical ward of the Townsville Hos-
pital, of whom 21 If, or 174 p.c., were suffer-
ing from malaria; but from July, 1915, till
June, 1917, a large number of returned sol-
diers who had contracted malaria in New
Guinea and Palestine were sent to the Insti-
tute for treatment, the figures for this period
being 178 malaria patients out of 692 admis-
sions, or 25.7 pc. of the whole. This brings
down the percentage of malaria patients,
outside of this period, to only 7 p.c. of the
admissions. Thinking medical men are be-
ginning to deride the malaria bogey, as,
although Queensland has the three factors
for the effective spread of this disease —
infected persons, non-infeeted persons and
the right kind of mosquito—it is realised
that malaria has not spread, and it is only
reasonable to assume that (1) the unin-
fected persons recuse to become infected, or
(2) the infection from the infected persons
lacks virulence, or (3) the mosquito is not
equal to the .job of transmitting it. The
Institute of Tropical Medicine has thus far
not decided which it is.
From “Yours for the Dissolution, D. Tired” :
Work on the Maekay - P roserp i tie section of Queens-
land’s North Coast railway has been closed down, and
material on the job is to be sold for what it will
fetch —and that won’t be much. Some of this
material is rotting and some has been pinched. In
one case a forge and anvil disappeared. The earth-
works have been constructed to 441 miles from
Mackav, but only six miles of rails are laid—from
Maekay to Farleigh Mill. All the men’s food, horse
feed, cement, tools, tents, tram-trucks and rails
were shifted from Farleigh by horse team to the
various camps, each teamster getting £5 10s. per*
day. Hundreds of yards of gravel were carted to
the bridge sites at a pretty high rate per yard; tbi-
stuff will be washed away by the first flood. Thr
bridge timber (hauled in sonie cases eight and 1"
miles) is to be sold, and as ft lies 30 miles Iron
anywhere it will go cheap. This timber cost 3s.
per foot dressed. The fencing is erected to the 20
mile; then posts, strainers, props and heels are strewn
about the grass for the next 15 miles. Posts cost
£7 10s. per hundred dumped on the line. “Per-
manent and reproductive works” —yes, certainly.
Tf this link were connected with Proserpine and the
Maekay-Rockhampton section were finished -tir-e
would be a railway from southern (indeed western)
Australia to a good bit north of Townsville. Mean-
while the selectors hang on somehow. Some have
been in the district for 20 years. I have been liere
seven years, and am no better off than when I started.
We were promised a line in 1914 ; but the next yeai
a Labor Government arrived and it is a Nationalist
constituency. So what can we expect?
Dear Bulletin, —Being buttonholed re the
Irish question, Lord Northcliffe gave an
orthodox echo of Lloyd George as follows:
I can say without reservation that if the setting
up of an Irish republic within 13 miles of Scotland
and GO miles of Wales is intended, no such republic-
will be tolerated by the people at Home or those
I have met overseas.
One might think that England, Scotland
and Wales were the United Kingdom of
Great Brittle from the panic-stricken ex-
pression on the political countenance when
Irish separation is mentioned. Every coun-
try on the continent of Europe lives within
13 inches —not 13 miles—of a more danger-
ous-looking potential enemy than poor little
Ireland, , whose army never in historical
times seriously biffed a worm. Bolivia has
live worse republics on its land border and
still takes its meals regularly. There are
plenty of guns that carry 13 miles, but a
gunner on the Irish coast could only hit
the Mull of Cantire with one of them, and
it isn’t worth hitting, while if the Mulls
fired back they could lay Ballycastle in
ruins. Wales isn’t much worth hitting either,
and 60 miles is a long range. It seems to
me the United Kingdom of Great Brittle
has an absurd attack of nerves. —Yours, etc.,
J. E.
A suggestion floats round that, in order
to save the constant replacement of the
very wearable £1 and 10s. notes and the cost
of printing and recording, they should be
replaced once for all by light base-metal
coins, tokens or “disks,” the “value” marked
on one side and a map of the Commonwealth
on the other. If such an idea is adopted
the bottom of the pit will have been about
reached. The paper currency has been
shamefully inflated till the amount in cir-
culation is less than the great wad of non-
circulating £lOOO notes. The Treasurer’s
“promise to pay the bearer in gold coin on
Demand” (“on Demand” in bold type with
a big D) has become such a mockery that
the departing voyager can’t, unless he is
able to pull strings, get a sovereign of his
own money to pay his drink expenses on the
high seas or to settle poker losses with people
who have no use for our notes. This coun-
try has no separate gold and paper budgets
in which the Treasurer, as in Brazil, tells
how much coin he has to meet foreign liabili-
ties that require coin and how much paper
revenue that is good enough for local needs.
It dare not attempt, as Brazil does, to de-
mand payment of Customs duties in gold.
But the promise to pay is still there, and
there is hope that it will some day be better
than it is now. On “disks” —old brass and
bits of superannuated door-handles sliced up
with writing on them—there would be no
room even for that remaining fragment of
respectability.

From a Victorian soldier-settler: —
Gibsox, M.H.R., recently put the case for the Vic.
onion-grower, but he didn’t give the whole of the
facts. True, the price this year is only £3 per
ton, and it costs £3O per acre to grow onions. But
what about last year? A, 30-acre paddock in Gipps-
lar.d produced 190 tons in 1920 and the same this
year. Not satisfied last year with. £l2 per ton, the
grower held his crop until August, when he got £ IS,
and the price had soared to £25 before the
of the stack was trucked. That paddock must
have returned the owner £3990 in two years,
against an expenditure of about £2OOO. The high
prices obtained by holding last year caused a
number of mugs to enter the game; hence the glut
in the market, and the drop to £3 a ton.
Onion-growers are one-sided Protectionists. 1
tackled one who was using an American plough and
harrows, and told him I had Melbourne-made imple-
ments which gave satisfaction and were cheaper
than his. He was sure his brands were the best —
hadn’t he used them all his days? He admitted
that he had never handled an Australian-made im-
plement, so his reason for adjudging the foreign
article the better was no reason at all —simply the
blind prejudice against home industries characteristic
of a certain order of Australians. In the same towD-
ship two meetings were held within a month—one
to ask for a duty of £6 per ton on onions, the
other to protest against increased duties on agricul-
tural machinery. Idiots like that thoroughly deserve
to grow onions at £5 a ton and sell them for £3.

fill half-a-Volume of Hansard with the his

matter that will be inevitably dismissed is
the attitude of the Government towards Can-
berra. Austin Chapman and some other
enthusiasts want to legislate in the wilder-
ness next year, and Chapman is so deter-
mined on his scheme that he threatens to
wreck the Government if he doesn’t get his
way. Though the Cabinet professes to be
undisturbed by Chapman’s menaces, it isn t
altogether happy, because it is jainbed
between those in favor of rushing to the
wilderness and an equally militant minority
that won’t consider the foolishness at any

N. S. Wales Premier Storey is not much
interested in a censure motion rag.ng this

sick man indeed.
Carruthers began his great attempt to put
a million people on a million farms in 1996,
when he was Premier of N. S. Wales. Even
in those days he couldn’t find enough Crown
lands for his purpose, so he resumed Walla
Walla —the first big __ resumption made for
closer settlement in N. S. Wales. He found
room there for 109 farms, and the cost was
£258,846 —£2374 per farm. And that was
15 years ago.
After many weeks of strenuous canvass-
ing and advertising the Diggers’ Loan of
£10,900,000 at just on 7 per cent, (and there
were conversion privileges besides) was
under-subscribed and had to be kept open
beyond the due date. If the Commonwealth
Government could have got better terms in
London it would have placed the loan there,
but it was advised that London was out of
the question. The Vic. Treasurer was told
the same thing, and Theodore, of Queens-
land. was turned down cold. In the cir-
cumstances the statement of Lang, Trea-
surer of the Ma State, that his Government
is getting London money—presumably por-
tion of Premier Storey’s mysterious millions —
at 5s per cent, may be accepted as evidence
that the age of miracles is still here.
The Labor Opposition in S. Aus. Assem-
bly lias declared in favor of the Butler
(Liberal) motion to reduce the membership
of the House. Butler suggested "by one-
third,” which means a fraction of a member,
the present number being 40. Gunn (Labor
leader) suggests making it 35. But the
rumbling of-a storm was heard when Gunn
remarked that the House “has for years been
dominated by the country, owing to the
scheme of electoral division. ’
In Melbourne a "special arbitration tri-
bunal” consisting of three Federal Judges
sits on labor problems, there being about
three tribunals to each problem now. It
got on to the question whether a 44-
hour week means less production than 48
hours, which leads to the question whether
40 or 3(> hours won’t do as well as either,
and to the Broken Hill demand for 30 hours
and more wages, and so to the ultimate theory
that all the necessary work can be done by
staying at home in bed. A witness from
the' Federal Statistical Office put the case
in a bombshell. In 1013 the value of every-
thing produced in the ('ommonwealth was
£218,814,000. In 1020 it was a lot more
because prices were higher, but the quail-
tity of work dono was so much loss that if
prices had remained the same the value or
the output would have been only
£173.225,000. There were 370,000 men and
000.000 li.p. of machinery (which represents
a heap of capital) at work to produce the
small output of 11)21, whereas 337,000 men
and 442,000 li.p. were sufficient to produce
the big output of 1013. So if prices get back
to the 1013 level the worker or go-slower
must expect to i-:ceive roughly 14s. where

fiscation of almost everything lias been re-
voked. but many of the things, especially
the coin which was swept into the Bolshevik
exchequer, art' no longer there. People are
again allowed to trade if they have any-
thing to sell, and oven the factories have
been restored to their owners, except the
dead ones. All they want now is to get the
old machinery and workers and managers
and customers back, and the railways put
in order to carry the goods, and some cash
or credit to buy materials. Foreign capital-
ists are invited in to take the places of van-
ished Russian capitalists, but the world has
so much repairing to do that spare capital-
ists don’t grow on every tree. And winter
is due in a few weeks. There isn’t time to
grow a new generation of capitalists before
then, and a great deal depends on what sort
of winter it is.
In Maoriland as elsewhere war wages

For 30 years or more Australia has

“vigorous works policies’’ that if it were
ever reduced to selling any of the public
futilities they would fetch a lot more than
they cost. Westralia has been putting this
ancient tarradiddle to the test. Its Gov-
ernment announced some time ago that a job
lot of State trading concerns were for sale
cheap, but not a single buyer loomed up. No
doubt the sawmills could be sold if the valu-
able timber concessions which surround them
were thrown in, but nobody wants the im-
plement factory or the Wymlham meatworks
or the Government steamers or some of the
Government pubs, and as for the millions
sunk in railways to busted goldfields, they
have been lost irrecoverably.
The Anglican Synod of South Aus. has
had its annual debate on prohibition, and
has negatived it, as it did last year. The opposi-
tion was on various grounds, including
the scriptural, one high authority declaring
that "Prohibition is not in accordance with
the law of God.” . Amendments, were carried
in turn in favor of reduction in the use of
intoxicants, and of specialising in beer and
light wines. When the latter bad become
the substantive motion, it was put. The
clergy were for it. the laity against, but in
each case only by a trifling margin. So the
matter lapsed.
Eighteen months ago the Queensland Gov-
ernment pushed through an Act authorising
the State to buy the Brisbane Tramway Cm’s
property at a valuation based on the profits.
Since then he has stood round in an impe-
cunious way and found no money for the
purchase. ‘‘Awards” have greatly increased
the cost of running the trams; but, though
railway fares and freights have gone up tre :
mendously, Theodore made tram rides a
necessary commodity and prohibited an in-
crease in charges. When the company’s
meeting was held in London it was suggested
that Theodore is out to artificially depreciate
the property so that he can buy it for next to
nothing, and no one has any alternative
theory to offer. Because Queenslanders
always fought shy of their own loans the
Banana State owes £54,000,(XX) in London —f
far more than any other State per head.
Some big loans fall due soon. If the Lon-
don people have the same feelings towards
Theodore as when he last met them, or il
the tramway business makes them feel even
worse, then the extra terms exacted on re-
newal may be more than the value of the
Brisbane trams twice over.
Another of the I.W.W. prisoners was re-
leased from a N.S.Yv'. gaol tne other day, but
no banquet was tendered to him, and there
wasn’t even a reception at the Sydney Town
Hall. Nearly two years ago, when the
A.S.W. Cabinet of Thirteen Pat Men was
still unborn, Labor leaders raged up and
down the country in two sections. One said
that the I.W.W. men should be immediately
tried again under special circumstances to
make their release practically certain
(Judge Ewing, borrowed from Tasmania,
was the leading special circumstance).
The other demanded that they should
be released unconditionally at once, with
applause, whether they were guilty of
trying to burn down Sydney or not,
arid should lie compensated for being
found out. These were tin 1 days when* crazy
folk went about by night writing "Frame
Pp” on the walls. They were also the days
when John Storey was going to be obliged
to import labor, so great would be the abun-
dance of work, and when the farmer was to
get his 2s. 6d. per bushel on the instant.
Two years of otfice have worked great
changes: things that looked so easy have
taken on a different complexion—and it
ivould be a lot more different if the Govern-
ment lived honestly and paid its way.
It looks ns though Sydney, having to a
great extent starved the country district’s
of N. S. Wales by contriving to get a peck
at all their trade, is now trying to do the
same with the mandate territories. Visi-
tors from those parts allege that copra, which
is the great and bulky staple of the islands,
must be sent in the first place, to Sydney.
So little of it is wanted in this country that
the imports for the last half of 3920 were
worth £094,488 and the exports £723,862.
Presumably it almost all moved on and the
difference represented wharfage and so on.
Generally it could go to its foreign destina-
tion direct, and it is said that the detour
costs as much as £3O per ton. This sort
of thing may end in Australia’s mandate,
with the ultimate possibility of full owner-
ship, being cancelled for inefficiency and
given to some person who may possibly be
a nasty enemy one day. If the balance-
sheet shows that German Papua, for in-
stance, has bpen turned into a huge loss
and a joke, like the Northern Territory,
something will certainly be said by some-
body.
From the Federal Gallery:—
The decorum of the Senate seems almost inevit-
able, because there are rarely enough Senators pre-
sent to make a noise. Even on the Taviff the muster
on divisions hovered about 20, and during the debate
the attendance averaged only a dozen, half of them
taking a faint interest in the proceedings. The other
night an ex-warrior, with a poor record for slumber
at the front, snoozed peacefully in his hat, and not a
word disturbed him. When the division bells rang
lie stayed where he was and helped the Government
to another narrow majority. Some other Senators
are not; so restful. There is Guthrie, the wool-
savant from Geelong, who sits up on his one leg
defying the longest debate to lower him from the
perpendicular. Duncan, slimmest and most incisive
of the Wa State six, has a ramrod-like stiffness that
satirises the attitude of his neighbor, “Jupp”
Gardiner, who, having a bow-window, lias to sit
well back to be comfortable. In oratory the most
active are Gardiner aforesaid, Flatten, Lynch and
Wilson. Pratt cn is silky and persuasive, Lynch
more forceful and humorous. Wilson in his fearless
indifference to the opinion of a majority recalls
Frank Anstey; but he hasn't Anstey’s remorseless
irony nor the same skill in marshalling words.

The Federal Mutual hung out its shingle
in 1912, but such good progress has been
made that after nine years its net premium
income is as large as the Mercantile Mutual’s
was after 31 years’ battling and more than
the business handled by the United in its
40th year. Of jcourse, appreciated values in
recent times have helped the Federal
Mutual’s figures in these comparisons, and
also local fire offices do not find business-
getting so difficult as in the days when thole
was a wild prejudice against the local under-
writer. The Federal Mutual set out to make
itself more “mutual” than others which have
made use of that term : it aimed to “secure
a combination of insurers as shareholders,”
and that policy is still ■ being adhered to.
Shares are “issued only to persons with good
insurance accounts,” and this shows how
rapidly its business has developed and its
share-register expanded :

All except 30.950 of the quarter-million £1
shares had been taken up at .Tune 30; and
as the management sees good prospects of
placing many more, shareholders were re-
cently asked to double the nominal capital.
The '219,050 subscribed have been called to
ss. each. Recent issues have been made {it
a 50 p.c. premium, and funds during the past
three years have been assisted by £6447 in
that way.
This shows the Federal Mutual’s under-
writing experience over seven years:—

So far the management lias been satisfied to
keep off the more hazardous business: since
the beginning £352,936 of premiums have
been received, and claims have averaged a
satisfactory 36.46 p.c. Last year’s was the
lowest to date. Expenses are necessarily
heavy in a young co. owing to the large pro-
portion of new policies written in relation
to cheaply-got renewals. But the Federal
Mutual, having proceeded slowly in its early
days, did not lay out large sums on "organ-
isation and extension,” usually a substantial
item in early underwriting balance-sheets.
All costs of establishment have been directly
charged against current revenue. _Sinee the
beginning all-in costs have taken 54 p.c. ot
net premium income, which is mild for a
young co. The total outgo in this way hnd
ito policy-holders has left an average under-
writing profit of 9| p.c. and a total of
£33,470 for the nine years. Interest has
given £16.232. Divs. of 8 p.c. for the three
years 1916-1918 and 10 p.c. for the past
three have taken £23.326, the whole of the
preliminary exes, of £4286 have been written
off, and a reserve of £28,544, all represented
by tangible assets, now remains. This re-
serve represents 35 p.c. of the past years
net premiums, and is only a few points less
than the provision usually regarded as a
fair thing to cover unexpired risks. Includ-
ing paid capital there are total funds of
£83,307, or 102 p.c. of premium income; but,
though funds 14 times premium income are
generally considered desirable, the Federal
Mutual’s smaller proportion must be con-
sidered in conjunction with the manage-
ment’s careful selection of risks and the fact
that so many policy-holders are vitally in-
terested in the welfare of the co. The funds
are ample to meet more than three times last
yeai’’s losses, and in addition there is
£164,287 of capital callable if the worst
should happen. The £90.586 of assets at
June 30 were in these lines: Government
securities and cash. £39,269; mortgages and
investments, £18,972; freehold premises,
£7433; book debts, agency balances and odds
and ends, £24,911.

Accounts are now presented once each year ;
so in the table past performances have been
resurveyed to give results for 12-month
periods throughout. The record goes back
to the time when sufficient reserves had been
accumulated to balance goodwill. W hen
floated 1!* years ago the co. had a paid capi-
tal of £550,000; hut the management soon
decided that too much of that was froth. 1 he
old proprietors (or, rather, their trustees)
in 1905 did an unusual thing: they sur-
rendered £50,000 of their scrip, and the bal-
ance of the £1 shares were written down to
Bis. Paid capital was thus reduced to
£400,000, find goodwill was left with a valu-
ation of £22,500, thpugh that intangible asset
was soon covered by an accumulation of
surplus profits. When earnings improved
the div. rate was still kept low, s<> the vol-
ume of reserves grew rapidly; buLjust prior
to the war divs. were lifted to 8 p.c., and
though the published accounts for the next
few years showed poorer earnings that rate
was not disturbed. Disclosed profits for the
four years 1916-19 averaged only £43,896,
compai’ed with £55,719 for the previous tour,
so it seemed that curtailed trading hours
and higher exes, were having a serious
effect on the beer industry. The profit shown
for 1920, however, was a record; and now
that is beaten. Incidentally, the figures are
given less £15,000 ostensibly set aside for
plant and machinery depreciation, compared
with £IO,OOO for the previous 12 months.
There is now £38,970 more capital at work
than there was a year ago, but after paying
9 p.c. on all old and new capital and on the
£37,500 of bonus scrip issued 18 months
ago, the margin of surplus profit is only
£IOOO or so less than on any occasion when
everything was going the brewer’s way and
the co. was paying smaller divs.
The fat profit is equal to almost 14 p.c. on
paid capital; and how the co. managed to do
it in face of heavier costs, greatly increased
excise duties and trading restrictions is not
explained. Probably it doesn’t need explain-
ing, in view of the mania for squandering
through which we are passing. Gross pro-
fits for the past 12 months were £563,282,
£154,578 more than for the previous year;
meantime exes, climbed £142,538. These in-
creases were no doubt due largely to heavier
excise; but new brews have also helped the
figures. Gross profits are always shown less
provision for doubtful accounts, etc., and
contingencies have called for more than
usual attention during recent years. The
Bulletin would not be at all surprised if in
the lean-looking years unusually large pro-
vision was being made to protect the co.
against possible effects of the no-liquor
assaults. Toohey’s management was not badly
scared, though: it continued to sink funds
in properties and plant. This comparison
gives details: —

Paid capital is £524,119; and £54,000 more
than that is in fixed assets alone. In addi-
tion, at the balance there was a surplus of
more or less liquid assets of £207,278, re-
duced to £184,327 by payment of the final
div. But brewery shares are so out of favor
nowadays that though Toohey’s net visible
tangible assets are valued to show about
225. 4d. per 16s. share when the eontribs.
are fully paid, the market is offering only a
few pence more than 18s.
Standard Rubber Cos. of Selangor, Ltd.
—Twelve months ago it appeared that this
co.’s ordinary shareholders were at last go-
ing to get a bite. Practically all the avail-
able area had been planted, the arrears of
divs. on the 12 p.c. prefs. to March, 1919
(43j p.c. = £6097) had been met, the estate
was healthy, the yield of rubber was increas-
ing and some profitable forward sales had
been made —54 tons were sold forward
spread over the whole of the year to March
31 last, the date on which the latest accounts
closed, at from 2s. 9-jd. to 2s. Those
were very lucky contracts, for the rubber
market crashed badly; prices for the best
crepe, after hovering round the Is. mark
for some time, dropped recently to a
nominal 6d. per lb (London). _ Having
secured good prices for 45 p.c. of its output
Standard Rubber was able to show a profit
for the year even though the 47,5221 b. in
hand at the balance was taken credit for at
only (i.TSd. per lb. This gives five years'

The profit of £3251 was nearly sufficient to
wipe out the two years' arrears of divs. on
the prefs., but the co. has not the cash avail-
able for the purpose, notwithstanding that
besides the year’s profits £12,042 had been
accumulated in the past. At Mar. ol lia-
bilities totalled £1421; cash and book debts
totted up £2754. There was, besides, rubber
apparently conservatively valued at £1351.
Whether a market has been found for the
product on hand at the balance is another
matter. At latest London held stocks of
70,000 tons, compared with only 22,000 tons
a year ago, when prices were four times
larger. The future of the industry is not at
all clear: it had been thought that surplus
stocks would have found a market fairly
quickly at low prices, but manufacturers
have pot absorbed the supplies. So the 2o
p.c. reduction of outputs adopted by most
planters has not eased the position, and some
producers have curtailed tappings by half,
while others have ceased operations alto-
gether. The little Standard Co.’s chairman,
Finlay Macleod, suggests a market control
by- producers on the lines of the Bawra wool
scheme; but it is questionable whether that
move would have the desired effect, even il
the big producer could be got into line. The
general impression is that rubber will have
a long cold time, and that only those pro-
ducers whose costs can be kept very low
will show profits. F. 0.8. costs at the Stan-
dard’s Sydney estate last year were 13.53 and.
per lb.; by exercising economy all round
the current year’s 300,0001 b. are estimated to
cost about 7id. per lb. If the management
suceeeds in cutting costs to that extent it
will he fortunate, but, even so, latest market
prices will give no profit.

The figures in the first column are not net
profits; they give results prior to making
allowances for depreciation. So much is
swallowed in this way that the table is pre-
sented to Show what happens to earnings after
working and administration expenses have
been met. Gross profits are steadily expand-
ing: 1919, £42,4 (6; 1920, £47,033; 1921,
£59,106. But exes, have moved ahead like
this: 1919. £29,137; 1920, £32,796; 1921,
£43,267. Of the £15,839 left for the past
year 38 p.c. went into a depreciation reserve,
the allowance being equal to just 9 p.c. of
the book value of plant, apparatus, stock,
stores, furniture and fittings after deducting
the amount already in the depreciation ac-
count. Possibly actual depreciation does not
call for such substantial provision as the
£42,138 accumulated in the reserve for
patents, depreciation, insurance, etc. Con-
siderable experimental and research work is
still being done by the co., and some of the
accumulation may be a set-off against these
activities, which, though not immediately pro-
ductive of revenue, may eventually put the
co. on to a winner. But since the precise
nature of the account is not known each
year’s additions are shown as written off
in the introductory table, and the accumu-
lation is not included with reserves. The
£2lßl shown there is merely the balance of
P and L., and is regarded as nominal
because £90,000 of capital is represented by
patent rights. Their true worth is not yet
established, and depends largely on what
use the Commonwfealth Government will
permit the co. to make of them. Over a
year ago the management, having success-
fully demonstrated its ability to get into
direct wireless touch with the Old World,
put a comprehensive scheme before the Gov-
ernment for the establishment of a com-
mercial service. The proposal was being
regarded favorably when an English com-
mittee reported on a complete Empife ser-
vice, and since then the matter has been
hung up. Amalgamated Wireless explains
the position:—•
From the Australian point of view the English
scheme appeared to be quite unsuitable, because even-
message between Australia and England would have
to pass over a chain of five stations, which from
the efficiency point of . view is introducing five points
of weakness, and from the commercial point of view
is adding to the expense. The cost of every message
would have to be divided among five stations, thus
rendering the revenue unremunerative or else making
the cost unduly high. In fact, the committee itself
estimated that Australia would lose at least £20,000
per annum on this scheme. We understand that neither
the British Admiralty, the War Office nor the Air
Ministry was consulted in reference to this com-
mittee and its scheme, and furthermore it is a fact
that the committee was formed and made its report
without reference to any of the Dominions.
The committee was apparently not aware that at
this co.’s experimental stations we can receive mes-
sages at all hours of the day and night direct
from existing high-power wireless stations in Europe.
The only logical application [of the co.’s experi-
ments] is to erect a high-power station in Australia
capable of communicating across the maximum range
of 12,000 miles and making arrangements with
existing stations or with special stations in all
other countries for direct exchange of messages for
commercial and press purposes. Both strategically
and commercially it is also essential to the success
of any such scheme that every capital city in the
Commonwealth should be in direct wireless touch
with the main overseas wireless system. This sys-
tem does not mean erecting a huge station in every
capital city, but the construction of a complete
system embodying one main overseas station with
local or feeder stations at each capital, to work
directly with the main trunk station. Such a scheme
this co. is prepared to carry out, and to finance,
either entirely on its own account, or in conjunction
with the Federal Government.
We are in a position to supply, on the best pos-
sible basis, one of the greatest needs Australia has
ever felt, and at the same time, to offer reasonable
prospects of a good return on the capital needed for
the purpose, r urthermore, we hope to be able to
conduct the services at reduced rates.
Meantime the amended Navigation Act has
given the co. a lot of new work on marine
wifeless installations. Additional capital
was required to finance these activities, but
the shipping cos. came to Amalgamated
Wirelesses assistance. During the past
two years £21),400 of new capital has been
got iii. Profits so far have been lean, and
over eight years divs. have averaged less
than 5 p.c. p.a. Meantime the co. has been
energetically developing, its interests, and
these may mean something for shareholders
by-and-hye. At June 30 the co. owed
£24,034, and had War Loan, book debts and
cash totalling £50,158.

Besides the £50,000 of ordinary capital there
is £7710 of prefs. of a pay-as-you-please
variety which carry 5 p.c. in the contribut-
ing stage and 0 p.c. when fully-paid. They
were issued “to provide funds for loans,
though 6 p.c. is a. stiff price to pay tor
money, which is to be lent out in that way.
The directors set out* to attract the sayings
of the small man, and declared that the issue
would be “gilt-edged.” Certainly the money
is well protected; but it is doubtful whether
the thrifty who put their savings into the
issue would find it easy to get out at _par it
they wanted to. Still, about £1.420 was
raised on these shares during the year. Divs.

Requests for loans were “very numerous”
during the year, but real estate values were
unsteady and the management proceeded
cautiously. It granted £31,331 of “carefully
selected” advances, but repayments exceeded
the new loans and the mortgage business was
£IOBO smaller at the close of the year than
at the beginning. Nevertheless, the interest
return improved £llO, but heavier exes,
resulted in £77 less being available for share-
holders. For six years a regular 8 p.c. has
been paid, and meantime £9OOO has been
dropped into reserves. The position from
the point of view of depositors and other
creditors looks very comfortable: at the end
of July there were assets with a book value
of £141,381 to protect creditors for £54,942.

ment claims that, if given time, it can pay

Hackett Bros., Ltd., ' of the Burnley
Leather Works, Richmond (Vic.). —This eo.
was established at the end of 1919, when the
industry was high on a wave of prosperity.
It started with a paid capital of £200,006
—£60,000 of 8 p.c. cum. prefs., the balance
fully-paid ordinaries. Everything went well
for a time, and for the first six months after
paying the prefs.’ interest and a div. at the
rate of 10 p.c. p.a. on the ordinaries —includ-
ing £40,000 issued for goodwill—there was
apparently a good margin of profit. Then
the market for skins crashed, Hackett’s got
badly knocked, and when the accounts for
the 12 months to June 30 last were made
up, and it was decided to value stocks at
replacement cost, a loss of £27,180 was dis-
closed. Taking in the balance of the pre-
vious term’s profits the co. was left with a
debit of £20,840. The proprietors of the busi-
ness which had been taken over—Alfred and
John Hackett—at once made a very creditable
move. Though they were under no obliga-
tion to do so, they decided to clean up the
mess by surrendering shares equivalent to the
P. and L. deficit. This will square off the
accounts; also it will mean that there will
be fewer shares to participate in future
profits, or, to put it another way, whatever
profit is made will give a better return than
would have been the case if the £20,840 of
scrip had not been passed in. The Hacketts
also surrender £4BOO more of their shares so
that the pref. divs. for the year may be
paid without leaving a P. and L. debit. To
facilitate matters it was decided —share-
holders naturally agreed readily—to wind up
the old co. and form anew one in which the
two managing-directors will get 25,640
fewer shares. The business will, of course,
be the weaker because of its misfortunes, but.
the Hacketts deserve more than a vote of
thanks from shareholders for their voluntary
surrender of share-interests so that the busi-
ness may be got on to a sound basis again.
Assuming that the present book values of
stocks, etc., prove good, then after providing
for the prefs.’ div.. the new co. will show net
tangible assets of £127,904, and that gives a
wide margin of security for the £60,000 of
lire! 5 , capital.
llow an Australian financial man saw the
London position at. the end of July:—
Avery determined effort is being made to melt
the mass of frozen credit with which the banks and
other financial institutions are filled. Money is being
made artificially cheap with the object of forcing the
huge sums—totalling ever- £1,000,000,000 —-in
floaters, chiefly Treasury bills, into trade or long-
dated securities. The policy Inis its dangers, but
existing conditions justify tin* risk.
inflation to a limited extent is again being resorted
to in the hope of stimulating eoniidenee, which is
sorely needed. So far the results of this policy have
been fairly good, and there is just a sensible im-
provement in the general tone. Credit is, however,
sorely strained in most industries, unemployment is
severe, and terrific taxation crushes all enterprise.
Economy is the popular pry, and the State and local
government authorities are being forced to abandon
idealistic schemes and cut expenditure to the bone.
Australia continues a free borrower. The Trus-
tees’ Security Act is Australia’s great asset.: under it
the States are able to borrow here at the market
price for trustee Securities with little or no regard,
to the manner in which their financial affairs are
managed.

The Bulletin’s Westralian mining-
man’s log of the Bremer Bay oil-“find” :—-
July 22: Flamboyant account in a Perth paper of
oil being visible everywhere.
July ,25: Manager’s report to directors that “a few
shots put in proved oil . coming from below.”
July 26: Telegram from local resident that there
was no truth in reported oil find.
July 27 and onward: Frantic attempts to get the
public in by street reports of valuable finds, etc.
August 16: Loud whoop from co.’s official on the
spot: “There are no limits to oil possibilities of this
field. There is so much oil here that I hardly dare
think of the wealth beneath the camp f100r.... Tests
of the shale gave 198 gallons to the ton, and the
bitumen product was purer than that of the famed
bitumen of Baku. . . .Oil sands and crude oil obtained
from the visible seepages held a product of the,
finest quality.... Geological conditions for the accu-
mulation of immense deposits of ore are more favor-
able than any 1 have seen in Pennsylvania, Tennes-
see and Ohio.”
August 19: Manager’s telegram to directors:
“Bore down 90ft., last 30ft. in oil sands; still the
same. Several tests made giving splendid results —
yellow oil, excellent quality.”
August 31: Report by Government Analyst: No
trace of mineral oil present in the samples sub-
mitted.
The latest was the arrival in Perth on Mon-
day of the prospector and laboratory-man,
who told the Mines Minister that they “de-
clined to believe the accuracy of the
analysis” made by the Department. They
declare that “free mineral oil” is still com-
ing to the surface from the 300 ft. hole, and
the co. undertakes to pay the exes, of a
further investigation. So Mines Department
officials will probably pay a visit to the
bore and settle all doubts.
Associated Oil Corporation, the best
equipped of the crop of oil floats, is getting
tef work. So far 25,000 of the 100,000 £1
shares have been privately subscribed, and
the promoters are awaiting a favorable oppor-
tunity to place the balance with the public.
On the strength of the snares already applied
for huts are being constructed, tenders are
out for derrick timbers and arrangements
are being made for installing plant in the
south-east of S.A. Within three months engi-
neer Guy Andrew expects to be running
three shifts with the most up-to-date oil-
drilling plant yet set to work in the Com-
monwealth. This plant wajs secured in
Maoriland at a cost of £12,000 —it had done
no work there —and similar equipment would
nowadays cost between £25,000 and £28,000
landed from ’Murka. Associated reckons it
can put down two bores for what another
co. would have to spend on plant alone.
S. Aus. Oilwells continues its habit of issu-
ing fortnightly reports, but Alex. Gordon’s
latest comes not from Kobe (S.A.), but from
Moutajup (Vic.). There a water-driller is
alleged to have got into oil-sands at a depth
of only 175 ft. in what seems to be a tertiary
formation in country smothered with basalt.
Gordon announces that a tender has been
accepted for deepening the present bore “in
the sands already proved to contain oil” and
for several other holes to test the adjoining
properties. Anybody seen these proved oil-
sands V And what traces of oil did the Vic.
Mines Department get from the sample it
received V

Dr. Jensen, of the geological surveys of
Northern Territory and Queensland, draws
attention in the Queensland Government
Mining Journal to the similarity of the
Rohm and Maranoa districts to the M*d-
Continental oilfields of the U.S.A. (Kansas,
Arkansas, Oklahoma and Texas). Except
that they differ in geological age, they' are
alike in most respects—there are no seep-
ages of oil on the surface; both districts
are monoclines in structure, with nearly the
same dip to the west; and in both the sedi-
mentary series has been laid down on an
irregular, graded surface. According to
what is known amongst U.S. geologists as
White’s Law, or Dr. White’s theory, as to
the occurrence of oil in regions where there
are carbonaceous deposits. Jensen says con-
siderable oil-pools might be expected through-
out the Jurassic strata in West Queensland.
The most carbonaceous horizons are in the
Orallo and Injune coal measures, Chiefly re-
markable as the source of Queensland’s arte-
sian waters. Jensen advises going back
northwards from Roma to the edge of the
carbonaceous basin, in the vicinity of Orallo,
for likely petroliferous beds at a depth of
about 2400 ft. He thinks that boring should
be carried on in shallower ground than at
Roma, and does not regard it as wonderful
that oil has not been found in artesian
bores, as the water pressure would dam it
back.
Unsigned radio to the “Wild Cat” from
the Wyndham wireless-station, in the Far
Nor’-West
Strevens’s petroleum expedition returned here to-
day (Sept. S), having obtained authentic evidence
of the existence of petroliferous areas.

“Oil Crank”: The importance of fossils
in regard to oil-finding in Australia was
the subject of a recent lecture before the
Vic. Royal Society by Chapman, of the Mel-
bourne Museum. He says that the fossils
characteristic of the oilfields of the U.S.,
India, Java and Borneo are found in the
Commonwealth in precisely the same rocks.
Geologically, therefore, there was absolutely
no reason why oil should not be found in
Australia under the same conditions as,in
these oil-producing countries. Mr. Chap-
man, however, is of opinion that drilling for
petroleum will have to be carried to much
greater depth here than in other oil re-
gions. Coming on the heels of Dr. Jensen’s
statement that the geology of Western
Queensland and the Central United States
is identical, this pronouncement of Chap-
man’s is highly important.

Hampton Plains is finding its level.
Several more of the alleged “good things”
have been abandoned during the past couple
of months, the Mutooroo is getting to the
end of its payable ore and the White Hope
is up for sale. Herbert Daly, director and
consulting-engineer, wants the Celebration to
get out, too, but the manager’s recommenda-
tion, which will probably be adopted, is to
stop development for the present, put up
a piant at a cost of about £BOOO to treat the
oxidised ore, and then try again at depth.
Golden Hope is still given a chance, though
experience at Hampton Plains seems to be
against its shoot going down far. In any
case, it is short. Tired of looking for wealth
on Block 50. on which the Celebration,
Mutooroo and others are situated, Hampton
Properties is turning its attention to another
of its areas. Block 45, and as a preliminary
is said to have repurchased Carman’s lease,
which the Boulder people turned down some
months ago. Hampton Areas has also given
Block 48. the home of the White and Golden
Hope cos., the cold shoulder, and has taken
an option on a lease which it recently
granted to a couple of prospectors on Block
41. Some nuggets were lately specked and
dry-blown there.
Mt. Monger Prop, held a meeting in Kal-
goorlie the other day. A Christmas div. was
promised, anew 4oz. reef was spoken of
and tPe early duplication of the present 10-
head of stamps was hinted at. The chair-
man spoke enthusiastically about the pros-
pects of the property. The mine, like its
neighbor, McCahon’s Great Hope, has some
rich ore near the surface, but dozens of
other shoots in the district that have failed
in shallow ground could be mentioned.
Investors long ago turned the field down,
and nowadays it is given over to speculators.
Rosewood coalfield (Q.) has recently been
investigated by geologist *J. 11. Reid. Coal
has been mined there for the past 40 years,
and at present there are half-a-dozen small
collieries, the Caledonian being the most impor-
tant. Although coal can be found in almost
any well or bore in an area of 10 square
miles, the official opinion is that the field
will never be a producer of any great import-
ance. There are numerous seams but they
are mostly spoiled by bands of incombustible,
and those that escape this failing are
markedly patchy and lenticular, so much so
that generally not' more than one colliery
cap work a particular seam in one locality.
The fuel, however, ranks as one of the best
gas-coals in the Commonwealth, if not the
best. When Mt. Morgan made producer-gas
tests some years ago it labelled Rosewood
the best local article tried. It is particu-
larly rich in by-products after distillation.
It is mixed with Ipswich coal for locos., as
it burns too fiercely and sparks too badly
alone. The Caledonian has proved to be
the best seam so far worked. It is 4ft.
thick, and averages about 8 p.e. ash. Lane-
field is a fine coal, but the seam is very
patchy and does not look to have any notable
reserves of workable stuff. Reid considers
that boring under the town of Rosewood is
likely to locate further workable deposits,
but holds that the output of the field will
never be large.
*• * * *
The bunker-coal business in Queensland has
been severely curtailed by the trade depres-
sion, and the Ipswich collieries have been
shortening hands during the past month.
Blackheath and Caledonian are producing
only half of what was won a few months
back, largely owing to a cessation of orders
from Maoriland. All the collieries are more
or less affected.
* » * *
Derek’s tin-mines, Stannary Hills (Q.),
were idle last month owing to a mishap to
the concentrating plant. Previous to that
the Cos. had put through a couple of crushings
from the You and Me open-cut. The return
from 1210 tons ore was 24 tons concentrates,
the ore averaging about 1.5 p.c. tin. A re-
covery in the tin market would give this co.
a chance of paying, handsome dividends from
its two mines, the You and Me and Lass o’
Gowrie.
* # *
The Wild Irishman, at Herberton (N.Q.),
is being given another chance. The mine has
been dewatered, and prospecting work in
several of the levels has revealed some nice
faces of tin-ore. The main object, however,
is to locate the exceptionally rich shoot of ore
worked previously at the 255 ft. level, but
which was lost when the drive ran into a
fault. A crosscut is being driven in the
hope of again striking it.
The Gordon, Irvinebank (Q.), maintains
its reputation as a rich tin-mine with a
future. It has 100 tons now above grass,
averaging about 15 p.c. tin. The Comet, at
Stanhills, is another show that catches the
eye. It has been tested to a depth of 100 ft.
by a shaft, and the ore ran to 6 p.c. metal,
while the lode is over 4ft. wide.
Jubilee (Tas.) during its last half-year
gave 1048 tons good-grade coal, the profit
on which reduced the debit on equipment to
11100. Manager McDonald expects to have
the aerial delivery to St. Marys completed
in time to catch next season’s market. This
aerial is to cost £5300 and have a capacity
of 400 tons per day, which is the output
aimed at. The seams are opening up to
expectations, the 766 ft. of headings put in
on the two seams having proved an average
thickness of 9ft. of standard ouality. If
the faulting peculiar to this field is not
excessive the property has every chance of
being a consistent producer, as'the quality
is good as Speck deals go.
* * * *
Renison-Bell (Tas.) made a loss of £450
last half. The property belongs really
to a Mr. Cripps, who has a first mortgage on
it for £ISOO. and who, as a judgment credi-
tor, waves the bier stick over the Board of
Directors. The mine has been closed down
since tribute work ceased last December.
Additional capital is required, but share-
holders are timid. On the strength of the
Mines Department’s favorable report on the
proposed pyritic treatment, the Government
is to be approached to find the money.
* * * •*
“Awaruite”: Brookstead tin (Tas.), which
Fitzgerald Bros, have optioned to Badak
for £50,000 or so, and of which The Rrr,-
LETIN expressed a poor opinion (18/8/’2l>.
consists of 6000 acres, 4000 of which are
said to contain wash suitable for alluvial
treatment. The property has for many years
been known to be tin-bearing, and has been
favorably reported on by various geologists.
Reports ’ published at various times have
given wonderful values, almost as good as
those of the original Badak holding, one
series of seven shafts showing, so it was
said, 201b. to the yard for an average depth
lift. Should this not be a sufficient en-
couragement many lodes are reported, 50 or
so. one of which is claimed to have given a
return of 2 p.c. oxide from a crushing of
1300 tons. Geologists aver the property will
he a great tin-producer. Certainly the pur-
chase price calls for high values. Boring
tools are now being secured, and there is
talk of Badak getting its plant into action
almost at once. Engineer W. Gullock’s
figures should be interesting.
* * * .
Mt. Victoria Struggle (Tas.) has at last
cut the lode at 524ft. It is 12in. wide, and
is said to show gold freely. Great things
are expected from the drive on the lode
northwards, but a lft. lode will need to
be rich if the show is to belie its name.
North New Moon is the last outpost north
on the Bendigo goldfield, and it keeps plug-
ging away, It has lately been working tue
348ft. and 17(i2ft. levels without meeting
with anything of value. Because the Ben-
digo A1 (formerly New Moon) south and
adjoining is working a large formation at its
1.142ft. level, the North New Moon intends
to concentrate on its 1307ft. level. It is
estimated the A1 run of stone should he
met with at 3400ft.
Clark-YVesley, Gundagui (N.S.W.), for-
merly Gundagai Big Iieef, but which was
taken over by the present eo. last year, has
everything ready for battery-erection, and
crushing should commence next month. Some
good values have been sighted recently: bulk
assays in the north drive from the No. 3
shaft have lately given For 22ft. the
reef gave over a width of lft., rich
still)' showing for the full height of the drive.

Baird, surgeons Argyle and Fetherston
and Tommy Ryan (Liberals), Webber,
Slater and A. Hughes (Laborites) and
Bourchier (Cocky)‘are the eight members
of the new Vic. Assembly who lent a hand
in the Big War. Bailey (Labor) won
medals and clasps in Kruger’s little scrap.
Thirteen of the 65 members of the new
Vic. Assembly describe themselves as farm-
ers and two as retired farmers. Count in
four graziers, three orehardists and a coun-
try landowner and you get 23, or more than
a third of the House. There are five lawyers
(Mackey, Lawson, Snowball, Eagleson and
Baird), two meds. (Argyle and Fetherston),
two butchers (Jewell and Rogers), four
bootmakers, four managers and one managing
director, three secretaries, two merchants
(Treasurer McPherson and Assistant-Min-
ister Pennington), five agents, one journal-

mechanic, clerk, blacksmith, plumber, accoun-
tant, tea merchant, baker, saddler, manufac-
turer, printer, cooper and tailor’s cutter. Since
the dissolution the House lost a farmer and
gained one, dropped a bricky and secured a
bootmaker, passed out. a lawyer’s clerk and
gave a seat to a med.
For the present Tom Storey, M.L.C.,
brother of Premier John, goes on with his
job in the brassfinisher’s shop at Cockatoo
works.
Charles Willcox, whom pneumonia has
claimed at just 78, looked good for years
more. lie w’as one of Adelaide’s most useful
citizens. From the businesses of William
Gilbert and Thyer and Co. he built up the
produce-dealing firm of Willcox and Co. (not
to be confused with the Wilcox of Wilcox
Mofflin). He was also brickmaker, pastoralist
and farmer, chairman of directors of the
coaching firm of Hill and Co., and before the
Tramways Trust came in he personally owned
the tram systems of Goodwood and Paradise.
He had a term in the Leg. Council, and two
years as Mayor of Adelaide. And he was
one of the founders of the Y\M.C.A., Home
for Incurables and other philanthropic bodies.
“Pongo”: Rummaging through an old
drawer the, other day I came across two
Deadwood Dicks stamped “W. M. Hughes,
Book Exchange, Balmain,” and I remem-
bered instantly how I got them. Hughes
at that time kept a second-hand book ex-
change and umbrella-repairing shop in a
corner of Palmer’s butcher’s shop in Rea tty-
street. As I was passing there one day the
future Priminister' pulled me up and said:
"You pass Jones’s place, don’t you, son 7”
“Yes,” I replied. “Well, deliver this um-
brella there and I’ll give you a couple of
books.” Mahony, the present member for
Dailey, was at that time a grocer’s boy
employed by 8. T. Wilkinson, whose shop
was within 50yds. of Hughes’s stand.
John Taverner, sometime Vic. Agent-
General and before that a .State Minister, is
coming to Australia this year, and his busi-
ness is sure to have
something to do
with an Empire
Exhibition in Lon-
don a couple of
years hence. Tav-
erner was hon. sec.
to the Exhibition
before the British
Government took
it in hand and
appointed a man-
ager, and he is
still one of its
most active direc-
tors. He has been
more or less mixed
up with showman-
ship of the sort
since he went to
Britain as Vic.
Commissioner to
an exhibition 25
years back.
Professor LYLE,
recently elected a
member of Mel-
bourne University
Council.
From one of the family:—
About Erskine Childers, Sinn Fein’s adviser on
Constitutional questions (B. l/9/’2l). His father
was the Gladstonian’s cousin Robert, a front-rank
Orientalist in his day. A sister of his married one
of the Irish Bartons, and their son Robin, an M.P.,
is now languishing for the second time in Mountjoy.
In spite of his present aberration Erskine Childers
has a fine record: he fought in S’Africa and wrote
a chatty book on it, and during the late war he
“flew” continuously. But his most striking achieve-
ment was “The Riddle of the Sands,” a book which
profoundly impressed the Heads in Germany, and
caused our Admiralty to review the whole situation
in connection with the disposition of the Fleet in-
Home waters'.
Two Iv.G.’s newly appointed in South Aus.
differ widely in birth, training, experience—
everything but aoility. Napier is still under
40. English-born, he came to Australia
with his father, a doctor, in 1898, and all
his law has been learned in Adelaide. He
was articled to C. C. Kingston, and, after a
brilliant University career, w'as in partner-
ship with McLachlan, then with Parsons
(now a Judge), and latterly with Glynn and
Baker. Dr. Richards, on the other hand,
though an Adelaide boy, went to England for
education, on the advice of the late Chief
Justice Way, and earned an LL.D. at Lon-
don University. After returning to Adelaide
he also was with Kingston and McLachlan ;
but mostly he has Deen in official positions:
Judge’s associate to Way, and then Parlia-
mentary draftsman till he succeeded Dash-
wood as Crown Solicitor. He is 52, and fol-
lows in Way’s footsteps as an ardent Metho-
dist.
Sydney Y-Emma lost its most ancient
Young Man when Sharp H. Lewis dropped
out last week, aged 92. In early days he
was associated in the Cold Country with Y-
Emma’s founder, Sir George Williams, and on
arriving in 1855 he joined the Sydney body,
then small enough to fit into a room at the
King-and-Pitt-streets corner, and became its
hon. sec. Lewis began his business career
with D. Jones and Co., later ran a mercery
shop in Hunter-street, and finally was mana-
ger of the Sydney and Suburban Building
Society.
The last post sounded for another Crimean
veteran when George Joseph Steward went
west the other day at Orange (N.S.W.)
after 85 years. He was in the Navy at
the time of that old trouble, saw service
in both the Black Sea and the Baltic, and
smelt powder later in Burma and elsewhere.
Dr. Eric Pockley, the Sydney tennis-player,
is making friends among the Papuans. After
an extensive tour in a small auxiliary ketch
through the uncharted delta regions from
the Purari to the Fly, he continued in a
small coastal steamer to the north coast,
and, landing at Buna with Neill, a naturalist,
climbed back to Port Moresby across the
Owen Stanley Range, a stroll of nearly 2(10
miles. He is now off with two others, Neill
and Chinnery, upon an expedition to investi-
gate zoological and anthropological data,
some of which are believed to be new to
science.
Walter Davidson is the third Ulsterman
to hold office as Governor of N. S. Wales.
The others were Sir John Young (Lord
Lisgar afterwards), from County Cavan,
and Earl Behnore, from Fermanagh. Young
was something of a statesman, having been
Chief Secretary for Ireland and Lord High
Commissioner of the lonian Isles. After
he left N. S. Wales he was Governor-General
in Canada. Lady Lisgar, when a widow,
married her husband’s private secretary, Sir
Francis Fortescue Turville. The Belmore
Earl had held a minor Ministerial office, too.
Sir Walter graduated from a Civil Service
clerkship in Ceylon to his present dignity.
Alfred Hicks, Vic. Honorary Minister, who
has just laid down his burden, spent most of
his life at Eaglehawk. In his callow days
he was a Bible Christian parson, and thought
he was made when he was promoted to Eagle-
hawk from another village. But he tired
there of soul-shepherding, started selling
groceries, and became a municipal councillor.
But Eaglehawk still believed in him and put
him into the Dreary House 1(> years ago.
He advocated payment of members of the
Plush Chamber, but the only time he man-
aged to draw any salary was when he got
£3 10s. a week or thereabouts as a member
of the Railway Committee. He retained till
the last his sonorous, pulpiteering style of
speech, but was a decent wowser, with
Radical leanings.
From an old colleague :—-
Passed away in Melbourne, Frederic le Gallienne,
a brother of the better-known Richard. After some
years spent on the Star and other London papers,
Fred came to Australia and was for a while with
Reuter’s. During that period he wrote a few vivid
things about the Sydney underworld for the Sun,
then in his friend Monty Grover’s hands. He was
in Melbourne when war broke out, but was several
times rejected on account of his weak chest. He
had no weak heart, however, for he practically lived
on tea and toast for months in order to save up
enough for a steerage passage to England. Arrived
there, he went straight to Aldershot and was allowed
to enlist a few weeks before conscription was in-
troduced. When he returned to Melbourne last
November he was a physical wreck, and would never
discuss his experience as a prisoner in ' Germany.
In one of his last letters to me he said: “Thank
Heaven, I managed to do something worth while
at last. All my life was not spent in writing futile
articles.” He was 43.
James Gormley, one off the silent M’s.L.C.
of N. S. Wales, has written a book about
his experiences; and there was quite a lot
to write about. Before he was out of his
teens he had been droving and gold-digging
on the Turon. Then floods deprived him not
only of his home but of his relations; of the
seven members of the Gormley family only
himself and a brother escaped by a long
swim and hours spent in a tree. Later the
present M.L.C. took up land, and, to help
things through, became a mail-contractor. He
was then only 21, so his infancy was pretty
crowded.
After drawing pension for nearly 19 years,
James Travis, formerly Vic. Sec. of Mines
and Water Supply, faded out last week. A
Canadian by birth he came to Vic. in ’52 as
a stripling of 20 and saw three years on the
goldfields. He claimed to have been one of
those who induced the local digger just
returned to the Leg. Council to ride round
Beechworth on a circus horse shod with
gold. Travis was 60 when he became chief
clerk of the Mines Department after 28
years’ service, and he was heading for the
seventies when he was made permanent head
in succession to A. W. Ilowitt.
When the late Murray Smith, old Free-
trade friend of the Argus, sat once again
in the Vic. State Assembly, he felt as com-
pletely out of it as Simon Fraser and Zeal,
friends of the Age, did in the first Federal
Senate. The social tone of the House had
changed since he left it to become Agent-
General 12 years previously. His former
colleagues were mostly dead or missing. He
was a fish out of water, a Smith out of the
swim. And he came sadly to recognise it.
The case of Fraser and Zeal in the Senate
was more pathetic, perhaps, because the
swim was .new, and they never had been
admitted to it. Little Zeal suffered the
added misery of losing former greatness in
the Vic. Leg. Council, where he resigned the
President’s chair in order to get elected to a
place among younger men who often laughed
at him. There was only Simon Fraser for
cobber with; and the sad conviction
that the world was not what it was crept
in between their wrinkles and gave them
both a pain.
"P.”: One of the dreams of the deep-sen
skipper is of meeting a valuable vessel adrift
a long way from anywhere, and of scoring a
bumping salvage award for giving her a pull
NORTHCLIFFE HURRIES THROUGH.
to port. Captain C. A. Robinson, whose
home port is Sydney, is one of the few who
have realised that dream. Some months back,
commanding the Port Stephens, he stumbled
upon the Yankee steamer Tashmoo adrift on
the Atlantic, having broken down on her
maiden voyage from New York to Cork.
Robinson towed the cripple to Queenstown
(Ireland) —a pull of nearly 2000 miles.
Then the Admiralty Court adjudged the
Tashmoo’s value at £480.703 —and the Port
Stephens harpooned £13,200 salvage.
Melbourne City Council’s “art” gallery is
to have William Kerr added to it. lie came
to Melbourne in 1839, when he was 27, to sub-
edit the I lebald. A year after he took over the
Port Piui.lip Patriot on lease, in ’45 he
started the Courier, and then, a year later,
the Argus. It was he who introduced
the demanded-of-conscience-to-speak-the-trutli
motto. In ’5l Kerr became town clerk, and
so qualified for admission to this gallery. IV.
11. Coffey, of Malvern, a grandson, gave the
painting, which shows the subject in Masonic
rig.
Anstey, M.LI.R., revealed a bit of secret
history during his unsuccessful contest for
the Brunswick (Vic.) Council. When
Anstey, Watt and Bent were members of
the State Assembly, Brunswick made several
futile efforts to .secure land for a park.
One day Watt delivered a venomous attack
on the Government, and great was Tommy’s
delight when Anstey stood up and pulled
Watt's oration to pieces. Bent presently
trotted across the Chamber. .“Hey, Anstey,”
he said, “when do you want that park?”
Anstey replied: “Ten o’clock to-morrow at
the Sarah Sands Hotel.” Bent was there
and Brunswick got the park.
Murray Smith died at the age of 90 or
thereabouts with a poor opinion of medical
science. After his return to Melbourne from
the Agent-Generalship in London, the quiet
little man with the large bumpy head was
said to be under sentence of death. Cancer
was alleged to be the matter. He was rather
more fragile looking than usual at that time,
and his obituary notices were got ready. He
kept them waiting 30-odd years. Inciden-
tally, he refused the offer of a knighthood,
preferring to look like an ex-Agent-General
of the old school rather than an ex-Gaud
Mayor of the common or Weedon type.
When J. G. Duffy was member for Dal-
housie in the Vic. Assembly between ’77 and
’BO lie had to address his dad as “Mr.
Speaker.” This is the only instance that
can be recalled of father and son being in
the House at the same time. It has not been
unusual for a pair of brothers to be con-
temporaries. The two Isaacs (Isaac and
Jack) and the two Austins (jj.II. and A.A.)
are cases in point. In the Tippah Cliambah
the two Clarkes (Minister Frank and
W.L.R.) help to keep a quorum. They came
in after Baronet Rupert, who had succeeded
his dad, had been bored stiff with the dreary
place and had fled.
“D.F.”: William Paterson, who escaped
having Launceston named after him, had four
sons, and his descendants are numerous in
Australia. Paterson’s family had to look
out for themselves; as Dr. Watson says of
him: “Unlike most of his contemporaries,
he left a reputation untarnished by
any suspicion of self-seeking or of any self-
interested use of his official powers.” Mac-
quarie, who knew him in his later years, and
took over the Government, from him after the
Rum Rebellion, describes him as easy-going,
good-natured, thoughtless and lovable. When
he died at sea off Cape Horn in 1810, he was
a poor man, and his widow was given a grant
of 2QOO acres in N. S. Wales.
A VICE REGAL DISCOVERY.
[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
“There must be in N. S. Wales many men who
made money during the war.” —The Gov.-General.
Somewhere in secret places dark and drear
He lies in hiding, the grim profiteer.
We chased him hard for many a day and night,
But never in the headlong race caught sight
Of his last coat-tail flapping to despair—
We chased the profiteer, but caught the air.
’Tis true we found a man who took us down,
As we supposed, at least for half-a-crown;
But when he told his story with a sob
Someone had victimised him for five-bob;
And when the five-bob plunderer we found
He wept of one who eased him of a pound.
■ln sad progression of increasing loss
Each nursed a pocket lighter than his cross;
And so we saw the futile hunting end
With general weeping over foe and friend;
For it was evident that all the town
Was making up for being taken down.
The average poverty was then so great
In every corner of the sorrowing State
We wondered how the people came to pay
A little more for living every day;
Though by the undertaker’s charge we knew
They paid a little more for dying, too.
Now on the high vice-regal word we know
That many men made money of our woe ;
And that in shadow, sombre, dark and drear,
There really lurks a bloated profiteer—
Some awful, treacherous, sly and wily brute
Whose pockets to his whiskers bulge with loot.
A Governor-General with speeches bland
Invites this person out to save the land ;
Asks him for all his sins to now atone
By plumping millions in the Diggers’ Loan.
Ho! Labor huntsmen, did you mark and hear ?
Scats ! Seize him, Dooley ! Here’s the profiteer !

HOW PA ENCOURAGED HIM.
PHOEBE: ”So you visited Molly’s home. Did
her father ask you to call again."
PETER "Well, no, I wouldn’t quite sag that.
Hut he dared me to do it.”
“Poledriver”: It happened in a Tommy
hospital, where I was drinking milk three
times a day to work off the ’flu. (The
whisky cure wasn’t in vogue then.) Sleep
had soured on me, and the volunteer nurse
whiled away the time telling me love stories
—mostly her own. At 1 a.m. the real thing
came to light—how she’d got engaged to an
Aussie sergeant, and how it was Spring
time until he'd got his health and his march-
ing orders back to France. “Then 1 never
heard from him again,” she said and wept
softly. I patted the little white hand and
said "Never mind, nursie, there’s better hsh
in the sea than ever came out of it.” She
raised her head and great glistening tears
streamed frqni her brown eyes us she sobbed
“Ye-ye-yes,. b-bu-but I wasn’t t-t-talking
about fish.”
* * * *
“Dido": Brown Mudder had an exhibi-
tion of oil colors in Melbourne a few months
back, and the general opinion of the cult
was that he painted landscapes well, but
had ruined practicall.\ every canvas by the
introduction of human figures shockingly
drawn. Brown Madder didn’t mind most
of the criticism, but he is still looking for
the brother-brush who scrawled on his
advertisement sheet out in ('ollins-street:
“Where every prospect pleases and only
man is vile.”
* . * * *
“The jSehoblic”: Let me pass a few re-
marks on the working of the very fine Vic.
Bush Nursing Association. In this district,
an ideal one for bush nursing—hilly,
sparsely populated, nearest doctor o 0 miles
away—we jumped at the idea. The nurse we
got was specially constructed for the job—a
practical bushwoman, able to ride, unafraid
of the lonely bush and trained to the minute.
We women felt an unwonted sense of
security in the knowledge that skilled help
was at hand. The doctor was a nark,
though, lie snorted a lot and once, when
the nurse, in difficulties, ’phoned him for
advice, the reply was: “Your job is always
to give the patient a dose of oil and send
him down to me.” Alas, at the cud of a
year our paragon was removed to start
another centre. That was her main job---
starting centres. Then nurses followed in
quick and variegated succession. They
mostly couldn’t ride, and in a district, of
bridle tracks this almost destroyed their use-
fulness. A month in the country generally
settled them—though t.wo settled on the
country as farmers’ wives. Then we got a
dope fiend. That settled us, and we dropped
out. The scheme depends wholly for its
success on the individual nurse, and I suggest
that the salary be doubled and the nurses
chosen with the greatest care. But I don’t
know —when you do get the perfect nurse,
some cow corky is sure to offer her a life
job nursing cows and kids —so there you
are. # ,
“S.M.” tells a gruesome thing.:—.
“Doc’s” instance of fine Australian mateship (B.
21/7/’2l) recalls a case that: happened in M.L. only
on Aug. 13. Leslie Jeffers, aged 21, working on the
construction of a road on 1\ harcrata llill, near Gis-
borne, was breaking down a bank with a 10ft.
crowbar, about lHn. in diameter, when the earth
crumbled. The bar, slip-
ping- from Jeffers’s hands,
drove into the ground,
point uppermost, about
Bft. below, and the young
man fell on the point of
it. lie was literally
skewered, for the bar en-
tered the right thigh and,
piercing T his body, came
out high on the right
shoulder. There the poor
fellow stood helpless, up-
right, until his mates
came and lifted him and
the bar together and laid
them by the roadside. It
was two and a half hours
before a doctor could get
out fro m Gisborne, and
all the while Jeffers lay
with the ends of the bar
protruding from his body,
liis mates' not daring to
withdraw it for fear nc
should bleed to death. On
the arrival of the medico
the withdrawal was made
and the wounds w ere
plugged ; then 16 of his
comrades carried him over
the 4 nine miles of rough
road to the nearest point
which the doctor’s motor-
car could reach. He was
gut co hospital nine hours
after the accident, bur
died the next afternoon.
Despite hi s terrible in-
juries—the bar punctured
the abdomen, lungs and
bladder medical opinion
inclined to the belief that Jeffers might have pulled
through had not the bladder been penetrated.
“Fleet Street”: Perhaps Northcliffe
wouldn’t have got quite so much booming in
Australia if there hadn’t been a tussle in
prospect between Sydney Sun and Melbourne
Herald for the Northcliffe . connection,
Campbell Jones, now managing-editor of the
Sun, organised for that paper an overseas
cable service, and Denison, the managing
director, won Northeliffe’s help in the busi-
ness. Then to ward off a threatening Mel-
bourne edition of the Sun. the Herald came
into the cable service, which since the war
has been run by Keith Murdoch, now editor
of the Herald. When the Sun bursts forth
in Melbourne about eight months hence, the
present arrangements, in which both editors
have had a hand, must crumble: each paper
must have a service of its own. Which will
get the Northcliffe connection? Both of them
can afford an independent service: but with
an issue in each of three cities (including
Newcastle) the Sun will have a big advan-
tage.
(JIVING HIM THE OPTION.
“Shut up. you brute, and let me go to sleep, or else tall distinctly so that I can tell
what you arc saying.”
“Gallery” : A new retreat for Federal
Ministers has just been completed on the
north side of Federal Parliament House.
It is an extension of the North Lobby, and
when furnished according to Hughes’s ex-
pensive scheme it will cost, over*£2ooo. There
is no doubt that the attentions of lobbyists
and other callers drove Hughes to secure
more privacy for his harassed colleagues. For
himself he already has a room in the main
building with an outer box of glass guarded
by a janitor to keep inquisitive loungers
from the keyhole, but the other Ministers in
the Reps, had to share an apartment,
next door to the Chamber, which is too public
to hold against visitors without a squad of
ushers and a screen of barbed wire. In
their new quarters Hughes’s Ministers will
he able to reach the Chamber without travers-
ing the public corridors, and when they are
tired they can lie back in snug saddlebags
and listen to the debate through dictaphones.
These latter are'Hughes’s idea: their inclu-
sion has probably been conceived to enable
his brethren to quiver under criticism with-
out being seen bv their tormentors.
“T.R.IL”: “Diukum’s” dictum (B.
l/9/’2l) that there is not a drug in the
Pharmacopoeia that will cure alcoholism is,
unhappily, sound. I am at present taking
12 months’ treatment at Lara as a nnal
attempt to effect a cure, although I believe
there is no cure except one’s own strength ot
will. I have taken the gold cure, the lurvey
treatment in London and the
Iveeley cure, but they arc all
too short to be of much ‘use.
When I was in N.S.VT:’ Dr.
Chisholm Ross did his best for
me at his Retreat, but I stayed
only three weeks. A 12
months’ abstinence should build
up one's constitution and will
power. If alcoholism is to be
treated seriously by law, the
restriction of hotel hours is
merely tinkering with the evil.
Here is my drastic remedy:
make it a penal offence for ato -
mic to manufacture the stuff.
If anyone makes alcoholic
liquor for private use or for
sale give him 10 years for the
first offence and hang him for
the second! Nobody knows
half, as much about the evils of drink as its
victim, and no Pussyfoot Johnson can tell
a drunkard anything about its horrible con-
sequences which he has not told himself—
thousands of times.
"Herodot” on a new sort of Jim-jam :
.V case with all the earmarks of dual personality
recently came to .light in Melbourne. A man of 22 first
firoUsed Suspicion as to his mentality by disappearing
from his home, to which he returned after several
days, without seeming to know that he had been
a way or done anything unusual. A month or so
later this occurred again, and when, just after that,
it took place for the thir<l time, his family managed
to have him kept under observation, with the re.-uh
that it was discovered that his absences were spent
in Melbourne's underworld, where he was known a-
“Jim." While he is in what psychologists might
call the Jim-phase. he has no knowledge whatever
of any other* life, and while he is normal he ha>
no recollection of his Jim-ness. The ease differ,
from one of ordinary loss of memory, where the
patient is generally quite aware that he has suffei. 1
that loss; it is one of amnesia in the wider seme
of the term. There is no known course of treatment,
although American physicians claim successful results
from hypnotism ; buf that science in its application
to medicine is in its infancy and most doctors hesi-
tate to use it for fear of adding complications. The
only thing is to have the patiefit “shadowed," so tint
lie shall not conic to any harm, and to hope he will
grow out ; of the Jim lapses. , There may be similar
cases of which nobody is aware. It is even possihlt
that amnesia may account for the commission of
otherwise inexplicable crimes, a suspicion for long
harbored by advanced thinkers of the medical pro
fession. A murder such as that for which a youth
was hanged at Sydney a few years ago might come
under this category, for the executed man stuck to
his story that he had no recollection whatever of
having committed the crime, giov did he even
remember any of the details leading up to it. k
time will come when such cases will be heard by a
Judge sitting with medical assessors, and when it
does we will have made an imposingly progressive
•step.
“Yacko”: Senator. Pearce’s reference to
the old Kangaroo Island (S.A.) potteries in
a speech on the tariff recalls an incident con-
nected with them. A man had some of his
toes cut off in the machinery, and claimed
compensation from the co. A suspicious head
office in Adelaide demanded a doctor’s certi-
ficate as to the injuries. Now, the island at
the time possessed no medico, so the injured
one carefully wrapped up the toes, which he
had thoughtfully saved, and sent them along
to settle the argument.
A BARGAIN.
SHE (Chewrfully): "Jack, our engagement is at
an end. and I wish 1o return to yon
everything you hare ever given me.”
He ( cheerfully ): "All right, old thing. Start
with the kisses.”
An Adelaide suburban parson has had hi'
library robbed of a lot of volumes, all or.
religion. Thus does the' city remain true to
label, even in its thieving.

SPRING.
[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
I love the merry sound of Spring—-the whole dashed
cheerful act;
The trees arc full of dicky-birds, an’ all the pubs
are yacked!
The soft spring-breezes lilt an’ croon amid the blos-
soms pink;
1 feel so darned poetical I’ll go an’ ’avc a drink.
The barmaids in their noo spring gowns arc jus’ like
angels fair;
There’s blossoms on (he counter, an’ there’s roses in
their hair.
My soul feels washed all free from guile—a; sacred,
joyous pain—
(O’ course I’ll join .yer, Mr. Smith. Right—fill ’em
up again!)
(We’ll ’ave another long-'un, Sis. ’Erc’s luck.) As
I jus’ said
The call of Spring (Two beers, kid—twice) seems,
now that winter’s dead
(I’ll ’ave a beer, ole sport—jus’ beer) —I say it
seems .likewise
(Well, ’ow about a beer? —two beers. ’Ere’s luck!)
jus’ Paradise.
There's shunlight. an’ there's hurst in’ buds an’ sing-
in* loeushts thick
(Yes, somethin' similar) an' birds (Oh, well, ’ore’s
to yer, hiy !)
(Lc’s ’aye some beer), an’ wavin’ corn, an’ beasts,
an’ scented stock!
(We'll get a dozen borrcls—hie.—it’s jus’ ml six o’
clock.)
So here’sh to Spring (Got lobsters, Bill?) an’ all th’
birds an’ crops!
There’sh wild floweish in th’ woodlands, an’ thefe’sh

"O.Iv.”: “The tiniest twins in the world,”
born in Louisiana (U.S.A.). are bo vs, and
weighed lloz. and 17oz. at birth. Yet they
are fat babies compared with Lucia Zarate,
whose weight at the end of her first 12
months was only lib. Up to then the tiny
Spanish-South American had been kept in
cotton-wool. When I saw her at the Egyp-
tian Hall, London, 45 years ago, she and
General Mite were showing with a couple of
old-established American dwarfs who were
much more than double the stature of the
tiny General. He was then said to weigh
01b. in the nude, and was large enough to
walk and talk in a normal manner, though
the voice was squeaky, of course. Lucia,
then a creature of sweet seventeen, was not
big enough to do either thing properly. With
an aquiline nose for her notable feature she
look rather like a spiteful bird as she hopped
along the table where they held their recep-
tions—at 2s. a head. Lucia’s weight was
LUb. or thereabouts. She could articulate
English words, but her native tongue was a
mongrel Spanish. Quite well proportioned,
she was too short for ordinary human walk-
ing action, so she hopped, "and sniggered
shrilly, and mostly did as Frank Uffner told
her. One of her constant duties was to hold
out a tiny clawlike hand and let anyone
remove a diamond circlet from her engage-
ment finger. There was a standing ofler of
this ring to any infant Avhose little finger
was small enough to get inside it. Emaci-
ated infants Avere brought along by nurses,
but never a one could get its smallest finger
into Lucia’s glittering jewellery. She lived
some years after that, eventually perishing
of cold through the train being snowed up
OUTTING OUT THE NASTY PART.
R AT: “But why do you believe in long en-
gagements?”
PEG: “ Veil you sec, it makes the marriage
so much shorter!“
ALWAYS GOT THAT.
STINGUM (a notorious cadger) : ‘‘Got a cigarette about you?"
BINGHAM (reluctantly): “Oh, I suppose so.”
STINGUM : "Hull, now how about a match? Tunny thing, I always leave something
behind."
BINGHAM : "Y-e-e-s. But it never happens to be this Manky habit of yours."
on a long journey in the States. Meantime
I met General Mite in Melbourne and
offended him by remarking that he had filled
out a lot since I saw 'him in London. He
invited me to come round to the hotel and
see him get into the very coat he had worn
when he was “appearing with Miss Zarate.”
Those words have stuck in my memory.
“Miss Zarate” had appeared to her bright
little midget-mate as a serious human being,
a fanciful maiden of marriageable age. To
me she had been something less than human
and more than marvellous.
“Keith”: The Hun had devious ways of
getting information from his agents on our
side of the line. When one Australian
Division was on the Armentieres sector a
defunct Fido was noticed floating down the
Lys towards Fritz’s lines. Owing to its
curious shape it was investigated, and found
to be stuffed with straw in which was
secreted a document giving away the disposi-
tion of our troops.
* * * *
“Ex-Dig.”: Sydney possesses an ex-Digger
with an almost faded scar along the side or
his chin which is not a war wound. In
Paris, with the glory of his pips new upon
him, he was making the pace with a
little French lady, when her husband,
unexpectedly on leave, came on the
scepe. No harm had been done, but
the Frenchman saw red, and demanded
a duel. The Digger, feeling himself
in the wrong, wanted to be concilia-
tory, but was willing to oblige; and
it was revolvers for two. When the
word was given the hammer of the
Digger’s weapon clicked on an empty
magazine. He had removed the cart-
ridges after his weapon had been in-
spected. “Shall we have a drink?”
he asked coolly almost on top of the
crash of the Frenchman’s revolver
and it was onlv afterwards, when they
got back into the light, that his friends
saw that his cheek had been grazed.
The Frenchman is now a pal with
whom the ex-Digger keeps up a regular cor-
respondence.
* * * *
“MacD.”: The other da,y a careworn, de-
jected-looking man walked into a Swanston-
street (Melb.) hotel and called for a beer.
Glancing furtively around he took a small
folded blue paper from bis vest pocket and,
with a groan, swallowed the contents. Im-
mediately the person in the blue tie who
had been admiring the barmaid’s hand dashed
to the telephone to call a doctor. Another
customer sped for a policeman; while the
barmaid endeavored to eject the would-be
suicide before he expired on the premises
and east a reflection on the house. When,
finally, things were being sorted out in the
presence of a John Hop, the mystified pro-
moter of the riot explained that he had
merely come in to wash down a headache
powder.
# * * •
“Hargo”: “Major" Cassidy and “Bravo”
fetewart, two great Bathurst cronies, were
always seeking a joke at each other’s ex-
pense. Bravo supplemented his income as
a hay-and-corn dealer by supphdng milk to
neighbors, the Major being a customer. One
morning Stewart, _ smarting under a rise that
had been taken out of him the previous night,
turned up at Cassidy’s nlace earlier than
usual and roused the Major from his slum-
bers by a stentorious “Milk-oh !” Thinking it
vvas the boy with the morning paper Cas-
sidy called out “Put it under the door!”
And Bravo did.
Ch.M. : Forbes (^i.S.W.) is one of the
most up-to-date towns in its dealings with
typhoid. lears ago it had a bad record
as a typhoid centre, as many as 160 cases
? f eID / reported in 1903 and 75 in 1913 and
1914. llien the Municipal Council opened
a public inoculation depot, and roughly half
the population came along and got three
doses. Result, a_ reduction of cases in the
next season to 25, all of them uninoculated.
Since then the depdt has been opened in Sep-
tember every second year and always does
good business, never less than 1000 people
applying for their little lot. The Council
controls the depftt, vaccine is supplied free
by the Board of Health, and each of the
local medicoes puts in an afternoon a week
for two months. A pity other western towns
don’t follow suit.
* * * *
“Zanthus”: In spite of Einstein, G. F.
Dodwell, Government Astronomer of S. Aus.,
sticks to Euclid’s theory that a straight line
is the shortest track between two points. He
has just come from fixing two such points,
one at each end of the 1000-odd miles of
boundary between Westralia on one side and
S. Alls, and the Territory on the other, and
all that is left to do is to draw the straight
line joining the two. The boundary is 129°
East longitude, but no one knew exactly
where that was. With •, fima i
rnent Dodwell and his college DIS&
(M .A.) were able to nick ut< - I s
direct from Greenwich or m>ar hr* S |^
(I ranee) and Annapolis (T.S \

on the East-West line, and one up i n th
Kimberley country: and Dodwell reckons I,

being the maximum possibility of error.
“Zanthus”: Salv’anny preachers and
others tell us that Hell is down below
us, but, judging by the samples that
drop occasionally, there seems to be
a section up above somewhere. One
piece, a red-hot meteorite Bft. in diameter
smashed into a hill near Tanuniii
(W.A.) the other night. It was so hot that
it was three hours- before it ceased to
brighten up the neighborhood. It isn’t often
a meteorite that size lobs in from space, but
bigger ones have been found at CraUbourm'
(Vic.), and compared with the huge masses
of meteoric iron weighing hundreds 0 f tons
found in Mexico and Greefaland, it was only
a baby.
* * * *
Dear Bulletin.—l just love to read once
a month that Judge Bugsby has been sitting
on the Bench again, surrounded by his cook
efy books, condiments and kitchen utensils,
fixing the price of meat. It has the
thrill of a gamble. Chump collqps are raised
a little after much bitter argument. Leg of
soup and sausage chops are declared station-
ary, but warned to be of good behavior. Ox-
narrative isn’t lowered enough to make any
difference. Something not worth all the
trouble happens to corned buzzom. Gristle
is moved about unaccountably and uneasily,
and so are suet and scrag. Cat’s-meat for
black « - ats becomes dearer, but cat’s-meat for
tortoiseshell cats comes down .OOlOd. In Mel
bourne we don’t run to a Iloust ahd Fr\
Justice of this sort, and things take Cate of
themselves in the old slipshod Way. The
dragging of our hash to court is, I suppose,
beyond us.—Yours, etc., Sarah Skirt.

“Urn”: Not all the housebreakers are pro-
fessional experts. A Northcote (Vic.)
woman whose husband had gone out after
tea heard the breaking of glass. Shouldering
the poker she stepped quietly up the hull,
switened on the current and saw a hand stuck
through a broken lead-light in the front door
and feeling for the Yale lock. As the hand was
trespassing she whacked it with the poker,
causing it to withdraw in such haste that
it cut itself on the glass. Then her courage
oozed and it was five minutes before she ven-
tured to open the door, only to find herself
alone. She decided to go next door till her
husband returned, and slipped round the
back way. As she passed her neighbor's
lighted back window she glanced in—and
stopped. The wife was bandaging her hus-
band’s hand, which bore a long, fresh cut.
Q.E.D.
“I wish I knew a new fashion of dressing
my hair. Could you tell me a quick
way?”
“Why, take a short cut, of course .”
“T. 0.1.”: There’s a line to be added to
“D. Frost’s” par. (B. l/9/’2l) about the
disputed pew in St. James’s, Sj'dney, 90
years back. Edward Smith Hall, the owner
of the pew, was not beaten when they put a
roof over his “box.” He placed a chair on
top and, to the great scandal of the church
folk, sat on it while the service lasted.
SO UNCONVENTIONAL.
[FOR THE BULLETIN. ]
“He has a blight, unconventional manner.”
He threw his hat upon the floor
And kicked the cat and mildly swore;
Then chucked the maid beneath the chin
And straightened the large opal pin
That nestled in his scarlet tie,
And took a seat and slapped his thigh.
He threw his cigarette alight
Into a vase of roses whine;
Then talked a solid hour on end
About the cash he had to spend. *
Peroxide looked to henna there
O’er brows a powder-puff made fair;
And eyes with winsome sparkle shone
To urge his heavy bragging on.
The dimples went, the dimples came,
Accompanied by laughter tame;
And giggling whispers fell and rose
Where nose dipped close to maiden nose
And passed the word along the row,
“So unconventional, you know!”
Thus on the entertainment went
To signs of female merriment.
How could they help it, those bright maids
Prom Darlinghurst’s Shem-huunted shades?
Their laughter held no hint of guile;
The thing that really made them smile
Was the sure knowledge, glad and deep,
That he who talked had countless sheep,
And cars, and cash and other things
That make large bumpkins look like kings.

“J.H.S.”: It is a popular belief that an
alligator cannot be shot with a leaden bullet. This
is not so. At short range an ordinary Winchester
bullet will kill almost any ’gator, if it hits in the
light place, viz., behind the shoulder. I saw an
alligator shot in Baffle Creek (Central Q.) with a
BINGHI STRIKES A DOUBLE.
BILJIM: "I'll hare a glass of two ales.
What'll you have, Jimmy?"
JIMMY: "Gib it two rums."
.32. Six pellets were fired into him at short range,
and every one penetrated to the skin on the opposite
side. The ’gator was only a small one (10ft. 2iu.),
but one half that size will deflect a comparatively
heavy leaden bullet if he is struck at a sharp angle.
Square on, at short range, a heavy' pea-rifle bullet
will damage him.
"Tin Hat”: "Mac D.” (B. 18/S/’2l)
needn’t get excited because he caught a Murray
cod with an unopened mussel in its tummy. The
greedy habit of swallowing his shellfish whole is
a common one with the cod, and I once saw three
large mussels taken from one weighing not more
than seven or eight pounds. The big-mouthed
bloke is one of the most voracious of fish, and wiil
swallow anything, from giant yabbies to tiny
shrimps, and from his smaller relations to the twin
propellers and hooks of an aeroplane spinner, which,
by the way, has superseded the spoon spinner, re-
cently announced in an Abo. par. to be the king
of all cod-baits. The cod does Cocky a good turn
by eating the yabbies that burrow into the walls
of his irrigation channels, and during the mouse
plague accounted for many hundreds of mice which
visited the channels to quench their thirst.
“Adelaide”: Told of Jim Crafter, still in
the stables of Graves, Hill and Co. here after 50
years of sendee (in the old days the Hill firm ran
coaches in every direction from the city). Living
two miles away from his job, with a good tram-car
service between, he has never made use of it, but has
walked both ways without a break. It runs to
something over 60,000 miles to date.
“Barcoo”: On Oakwood station, on the
Ward River (south-west Queensland), there is a
ewe that nearly every season gives birth to a lamb
with only three legs—two hind and one front. There
are other peculiarities in this flock also. Numbers
of the ewes have small bogus mouths under either
ear, some containing from one to three “cropping”
teeth. In one instance a miniature tongue was vis-
ible behind two full-sized teeth.
* * * *
“D.F.”: Various writers have talked of
the abos. taming the dingo and using it in hunting.
If they ever tried such a thankless job it was for
want of something better. They were quick to get
real dogs as soon as they had a chance. In the
diary of the expedition to Westernport in 1826-27
Ilovell notes that the abos. of those parts, who had
never been in touch with white men except the seal-
ers and hunters from Port Dalrymple, had kangaroo-
dogs. In fact, dogs were one of the chief commodi-
ties which the abos. got from the sealers in return
for gins. The still more primitive Tasmanian abos.
were just as quick to see the value of dogs. The
lubras would feed the puppies at the breast, and
when their owners were removed to Flinders Island
in 1831-33 the dogs ran wild and were a great
nuisance. Dogging at so much a head was a regular-
business for some time.
“Jim Carew”: While Abos. are arguing
about the efficacy of the sap of the curigevoi as
an antidote to the stinging-tree, perhaps they can
spare a minute and tell me how. Binghi treated the
cungevoi plant before he used it as food. Although
the plant is poisonous Binghi managed to make a
fairly palatable and nourishing food out of it.
“Cocky”: The stinging-nettle, though it
isn’t so maddening as the northern stinging-tree,
can cause a lot of irritation, and I have had many
painful experiences of it. Now I can recommend
as an absolute cure the sap of the large-leafed dock-
weed, which is almost always to be found in prox-
imity to the nettle. Bruise the stem of the weed
and rub the sap well into the affected skin, and in
ten minutes you’ll be right.

“Cartot” : Seventy years ago in Banana-
land they had novel ways of raising the wind when
times were ixard on the goldfields. Late in the
’fifties a boatload of Chinese coolies arrived at Cook-
town bound for the diggings, and in them a couple
of miners saw a chance to make a rise. They got a
rope and fixed up a barricade at the entrance to the
wharf, and each Chink as he passed through the
barrier was separated from a couple of shillings as
an alleged poll-tax. As there were over 200 coolies
the collection made a respectable shout, even at the
rates then prevailing. Nobody lodged an objection,
and everybody, the local representatives of law-an’-
order included, looked upon it as the best joke of
the week.
“Tah Bah”; Passed out on the N.T. table-
lands recently, Paddy Lenny, who owned some hundreds
of horses with never a brand. For years he had been
a thorn in the side of the big man to . whose grass
he helped himself. He was a real horse-collector—
thought and talked in horse, yet never could be per-
suaded to part with one. Ragged and unkempt he
reached Darwin not so long ago to touch up a bush
pirate who had got away with a score Of prads he
had planted on a big squatter’s run. He had walked
in to the Katherine and “jumped the rattler” to
Darwin. When the solicitor he engaged asked him
for something on account he said he had “no money,
but plenty horses out back.” This didn’t suit Gent
One, so off Lenny toddled on his trek back of hun-
dreds of miles. He died on the track. liis mob of
horses, which, having no country of his own, he used
to dump wherever he could, should be a useful col-
lection for the Public Trustee —if the bush trustees
haven’t already helped themselves.
“En. Zed”: Tell "588” (B. 4/8/’2l) that
if he tries Henare’s recipe for lambs’ tail he will
not be disappointed. During ithe docking season
in Maofiland it is mostly Henare who is engaged
to do the work, and the tails are always used as
food. He proceeds this way. With a spade he
digs a fairly large hole in the ground (not too
deep). In it he sets a fire, and places stones on top.
The stones get redhot. lie has the tails skinned
and places them on the stones and covers with a wet
sack. • In a short time they arc ready for serving.
Henare also cooks another delicacy along with the
tails; but perhaps “588V’ taste does not run in
that direction.
“Tamata”: “Opliis” (B. 11/8/’2l) says
that about 20 is the maximum number of young
brought forth at one time by the black snake. In
1894 I was riding on Abrabadi run, near Waleha
(N.S.W.), with a kangaroo-shooter, Henry Ileyman,
when we saw a large black snake coiled up. Hev-
man fired a bullet through all the coils horizontally,
and from the holes thus made small, bladder-like
eggs rolled out. On these being pricked with a knife
young snakes about Bin. long emerged. Ileyman
then ripped up the snake with his knife and we

Coonaoarabran : ”C.0.M.” complains

to mention the bluegum. and what name could be
more suggestive? And what more beautiful than the

“kurrajong,” “karri” and “jarrah,” for example?
All when pronounced properly compare rather favor-
ably with the names of English, trees. And, passing
to the flowers, what is wrong- with such as “wara-
tah” and “wattle” ?

"Saaedi” : We were riding back from the
races all more or less blithered, when Bill’s prad
shied violently and swung off under a strong leaning
sapling, which caught Bill about where his beer was
and scraped him out of the saddle. When we got
back to him Bill was breathing beery defiance. “1
can ride the cow all right,” he asserted stoutly,
“only he (hie) caught me that time siftin’ loose.”
"Pick”: Re the utility of poisoned ani-
mals’ skins for furs and rugs. It depends upon
the poison used. Cyanide, employed for ’possum
poisoning, is sudden death, and little harm results
to the fur. But strychnine or phosphorus brings a
more lingering death to a fox. and his skin is
affected. Six months after his pelt is tanned' the
fur may be plucked out in handfuls.
OVER THE ODOR.

They're rough in Sydney these days!

they?"

Thu solution which he thinks ha-

whatever density he requires by mixing benzine
and stirring until the benzine is absorbed. Should
he desire he can get unvulcanised quick-cure rubber

to having seen a lung-fish about 4ft. long, though
previously he had not seen one longer than about Din.
lb- may have got a little mixed between two dif-
ferent species. There is a small chap known as the
mud-skipper (Periopthalmus), a fish with well-
developed fins and large, bulging eyes. It inhabits
the mangrove flats in North Australia, where it
generally basks on the roots which stick out of the
mud; if disturbed it quickly skips away over the
mud, or down into the water. This species does
not grow larger than 12in., but a Din. specimen is
really large. The four-footer was most probably
the true lung-fish ( Ceratodws forsteri ) ; it is very
elongate, and the posterior portion of the body is
somewhat eel-like, though covered with large scales.
The eyes are .small and do not bulge as in the mud-
skipper. The eeratodus has been known to weigh
almost 201 b. and measure nearly 6ft., so “Muni
Mule’s” specimen is not a record. There’s one in
Taronga Zoo (Sydney) over 4ft. long. The mud-
skipper and the lung-fish are not related.
* * * *
“Howitzer” : Re “A.M.B.’s” homing frog
(B. 25/8/’2l). In 1912, at Buderim Mountain
(Q.), a local medico captured a frog which had
haunted his bathroom for months. Asa test, he
securely tied a strand of red, silk to it, placed it in
a cardboard box, and had it taken by sulky to
Woombye, a distance of 12‘miles, and released. In
11 days the old chap was croaking away merrily in
his old possie.
"Steve Hart”: “Oapt” (B. 25/8/’2l) says
that the sap of the Queensland stinging-tree if applied
to relieve the pain would only tend to aggravate it.
Assuming that the northern tree is identical with
the one in N.S.W., then I reiterate that the sap
from the main stem is an absolute cure. The main
cause of the agony is the multitude of microscopic
spikes on the underside of every leaf. For that
reason xhaviijg the part affected, as tried by
“W.C.0.” (B. 25/8/’2l), would give a lot of relief
by pulling many of the spikes out. But the sap
rubbed in seems immediately to obliterate them.

THE BUSH SPEAKS OUT.
[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
I am the friend of the lonely men,
Of the men that read and think ;
The men that ride on- the falling tide,
And some of the men that drink.
Many a man that has wasted life,
And whose world was drear and black,
I’ve cleared his name that was steeped in shame,
And given his manhood back.
I am the land of the open road,
The land of the fenceless range;
And men may fight for wrong and right,
But the Bush will never change.
They’ll lock my rivers and dam my creeks
Till my lakes are like the sea,
But flowing drains or flying trains
Will never imprison me.
They prate of a million farms lor men—
-1 can laugh their schemes to scorn.
I’m here to stay where I’ve held my sway
Ere a million men were born.
They’ve flung a wine to the north and the south,
And a road runs east and west;
Their men may ride where my plains are wide,
But ploughs shall not scar my breast.
The fires have blackened and burnt me bare,
And the drought has sucked my blood;
Then came the rain and I lived again
And my rivers flowed in flood.
Settle the men by my wide coast lino,
Where the friendly sea-winds blow;
But I am king where the west winds sing
And the gidya forests blow.

“Tin Hut’': Tell “Rae-Akiaki” (B.
11/8/’2l) that the owl’s habit of taking a midnight
supper is the cause of many a bat meeting a sudden
death. The solemn-looking chap is one of the fastest
and most acrobatic birds known, and in addition,
owing to his wings being fringed with soft feathers,
he moves, even when travelling at his top speed, in
absolute silence. The bat has only one chance when
chased—to get to thick timber or scrub and flash
through a space too small to admit his pursuer.
But generally he is eaten, the noiseless approach of
his enemy giving him no warning.

“Ziff”: At Talbingo (N.S.W.) a few
months ago I was shown a horse, the property of
the publican, which had peculiar-looking claws
protruding from the back of his feet. Does any
Abo. liar know anything about these “claws” on
horses ?
-X- * * *
“Crabtree”: A'Taree (N.S.W.) man sup-
plies the latest dog story. Riding into town
one evening, he tied his horse up and left his dog,
a retriever, in charge, while he transacted some
business. When he returned he found that the
horse had broken away, and, the dog was absent.
After a long search he tramped home; and he
found both animals at the gate of his farm, the
dog with the horse’s reins in his mouth. Evidently
after a long chase—the horse was covered with sweat
—the retriever had captured the prad and led it
home.
“Biltong”: A few days ago a double-
headed brown snake was brought, down to Sydney
from the N. Territory by Mr. S. Macdonald. it
was caught and bottled by a fencer on the Ord
River, is 12in. long, and its two heads, which branch
out from a single neck, are a perfect pair in size
and completeness.

“Saaedi”: I had a sheep-dog, floppy, who
was very much attached to me, and he followed me
in to the railway station when I was going to
Sydney. Upon my return I was greeted effusively on
the platform by old Hoppy, which rather staggered
the man who came in to take me home, as he said
the dog had been missing all the time I had been
away. Later a friend told me that Hoppy had
worked for him while I was in Sydney. This chap,
who was minding sheep about three miles from the
railway, said my dog stayed with him contentedly
until one night when he became restless, whined, and
finally left the camp fire and made off in the direc-
tion of the railway station. The hour and date
A N IMPOSTOR.
TTHE SWAGGIE : “Going slcetchin', are you?
Well, ye can't he much of an artist from
what I 'ears of them. Why, there ain't
a pub within twenty miles."
that floppy left his job corresponded exactly to the
time I left Sydney. It was nearly 400 miles from
this place to the city; but I don’t want any dam-
phool to say on that account that if my dog had
displayed any commonsense he would have left it
till morning to meet the train.
“Baree”: The men who go missionarying
among the birghis of the Far North—they do most
of it with a medicine-chest —don’t take feather beds
with them. Fletcher, of the Goulburn Island
(Methodist) mission, has just had one of the experi-
ences that are liable to come their way. With his
baby son (not yet two years old), one white man
and five native boys he left the station lugger near
Port Bremmer, on the east shore, to walk across
the point, a distance of 30 miles, and pick up the
vessel again at Brown’s Camp on the other side.
The party took food for a day and a half, with a
small extra supply of .flour, which latter the blacks

ate at the first stop. They hud a rifle and shot-
gun, but only a few rounds of ammunition. They
reached Brown’s Camp on Saturday afternoon, but
saw no lugger. After waiting till Monday morning
they set out to walk to Ross Point opposite Goui-
burn Island, nearly 100 miles distant. They got
there on Thursday afternoon. Fletcher carried his
baby son in his arms the whole way. When they
reached Ross Point they found there \Vere neither
canoes nor natives there. After three days of wait-
ing three of the native .boys of the party tried to
swim the strait—here two miles wide —but the
strong current swept them out to Sims Island, where
they stayed. It was not until the following Mon-
day that the mission folk saw the party’s signals
and went to their relief. The whole trouble arose
through the lugger being wrecked only five miles
from where the party originally left her.

“Barney”: I have had some sanguinary
encounters with the blood-sucking leeches of our
coastal scrub lately, and wish to dive into the
Ano. Encyclopedia for information. What do they
feed on when they can’t find me? And how do
they find me? I've watched the beggars get up on
their tails, sway for a second and then head straight
for me. It doesn’t matter if I am on the leeside
or the windward. Do they pick up the scent, or
can they see? I don’t object so much to their
having a bit of a feed, but I do object to their
leaving the plug out after they have finished. When
I pull off my socks I often find them saturated
with blood, and the puncture still oozing, the leech
having dropped off, bloated like a profiteer, and left
the tap turned on. Now, what do you know?

“M.C.”: “Shicker” is not the only slang
word that can claim Hebraic origin. Here are a
few to go on with: “Molar,” drunk; “ooftish,”
money; “mozzel,” luck; “shies mozzel,” bad luck;
“guyver,” swank; “shlenter,’’ false; “clobber,”
clothes. These were Petticoat-lane terms a genera-
tion or so ago, but hardly known outside. The
Hebrew comedian introduced them to English and
American audiences, but before that they were
brought to Australia by Israelites in the gold-rush
days.

“Kapiti”: The seagulls of Totranui Bay.
near Nelson (M.L.), are champion eye-droppers. In
the sand stands a little rock, roughly 6ft. in diam-
eter. At low water the birds take a cockle to a
high altitude, let go, spiral quickly down to
beat thieves, and collect the contents of the shell
broken on impact with this rock. You see them at
their best in a howling northerly, when they fly into
the teeth of the gale, allow for windage and never
miss.
* » » *
“B. Melon”: Aragun” (B. 14/7/’2l) may
be interested to know that out on the Balonne
(Q.) in the early ’eighties there was a small tribe
of blacks all innocent of hair. They kept together
and rarely associated with other niggers. Baron
Von Mueller made a trip out west to see these
interesting specimens, and no doubt has left some
note o; them.
“Te Pana”: At night the market-place in
Papeete is a meeting-place for all sorts and condi-
tions in the island world. Among the crowd are
French inen-of-war sailors, English and American
tourists, Chinamen, men from the Paumotus, and
newly-arrived native girls. Along the footpaths
are squatted elderly women, with little bundles of
fruit, confections, wreaths of gardenias, or shells
on the ground in front of them, the whole stock
worth a franc or two and lighted by a solitary
candle. Out in the roadway a band of girls chant
boastful stories of their dissipations of th.‘ previous
night—generally in praise of the generosity of their
French gentlemen-friends. Unlike the girls of a
remote island they are modestly covered with clothes
from their necks to their ankles, and would be
shocked to be seen otherwise attired. They are the
product of native custom and the easiest brand of
French morality. To one of these girls as night
wears on will step up a dainty, starched French-
man, and shake hands. Then he puts an arm
around her neck, and they skip away down the
street and out of sight. Towards 10 o’clock a
dozen couples may be seen skipping off in the same
fashion. In the daytime you see another type ot
native sheltering under the trees lining the roads.
Few of the brown passers-by are the physical gods
of Tahiti pictured by fictionists. Mostly they are
weak and undersized, smitten with yaws' and scro-
fula and swollen with elephantiasis; and a steady
stream of people daily makes the pilgrimage to the
V.D. clinics, where the skilled French surgeons
work overtime. The German Pacific Fleet in pass-
ing only effected a temporary clean-up of “the sink
hole of the Islands.” Rebuilding operations are
just about complete.
* * * *
“P. Melon”: Re increasing the crop of
pawpaws. I grow five females in a circle about
6ft. apart, with a male in the centre of the ring.
Don’t depend on the bees or the wind, or your
neighbor to grow a male to do your inoculating. I
have a record crop now bearing, and I reckon it will
last till March.
* * * *
“Gad” : Re vitality in animals. A boy
heard a cat down a 60ft. shaft alongside us and
made unavailing efforts to rescue it with a bucket
on the end of an old rope. Next morning puss did
not respond to repeated callings, so it was concluded
that the poor beast had died. The boy went to
school in the city next day and the incident was
forgotten except by a neighbor, who had missed his
beloved “Dooley” a week before, and was now mourn-
ing him as dead. “He has been down there a week
now,” he argued, “and no cat could live that long
without a drink.” One month from that day the
boy’s mother passed the shaft and was horrified to
hear mewing again issuing therefrom. A miner’s
services were requisitioned, and he descended and
brought “Dooley” up. Although very thin, he
seemed very little the worse. The shaft was quite
d.y and there were no drives or get-away places.
**•*•*
“D.F.”: The native raspberry, found in
Tasmania and N. S. Wales, is probably the best of
the native fruits of the southern States, though the
wild cherry is good, where the crop is thick enough
to make it worth picking; and the quandong would
be good if there were less stone and more quandong.
The biggest wild raspberries I have seen grew in
the scrub just under the top of Mount Kembla on
the South Coast of N. S. Wales. They were quite
up to the size of the garden raspberry, and a beauti-
ful deep red. But they hadn’t the flavor of the Tas.
specimens, maybe because the latter generally grow
out in the open and get more sun and air. As
Leonard Itodway, the Speck’s Government botanist,
has pointed out, the wild raspberry is one of the
native fruits which might, well repay cultivation
and selection, but no one has bothered about it yet.

“Joy Wheel”: Both “Sandflv” (B
21/7/’2l) and “Bora” (B. 11/S/’2l) will have to
liven up to equal the calf-branding score put up at
" ooroowoolgen station (N.S.W.) i„ '9B when 19*
f at calves of about equal sexes and aged from vv
to 12 months were branded, castrated, year-numbered
and earmarked in 47 minutes, j The earmark \ VU - a
rather difficult one, requiring five distinct cut- (or
strokes) with the knife. The whole 107 were hand-
thrown (“scruffed”) by Land and Townsend. C. H
Anderson, the well-known North Coast bookie kept
time and used the knife. Towyan, an abo! who
lately put up another record by committing suicide
used the brands like the master of the game be was'
I handed the brands—the rottenest job of the lot.
“Silas Snell”: After Holmes married he
built a curious little retreat in a big gum near bis
home, access to which was by way of a ladder of
cleats nailed across a tall pole. Seeking sanctuarv
in his tree in emulation of a character celebrated
in literature, Holmes always drew his ladder up
after him. Sometimes he even slept in his little
bark platform-house. Seeing him perched aloft on
a Sunday afternoon, I ascribed his arboreal habits
to ancestral influence; but when I returned to
Boyang a couple of years later the lofty retreat was
blown away, and Holmes was no longer a tree-
dweller. His explanation was very simple ami
appealing. “The missus beat me,” said he. “She
bought one of those megaphones.”
* * * *
“Riom” : One pitch-black night lately our
mailman ran over a belated wayfarer. He turned
the sulky round to pick up the unfortunate, and
ran over him again. It was then unanimously
decided by both parties that the mailman should
stand still and let the footman find the sulky.
“Adrian”: A cow cocky here (Amby, Q.)
had a pet owl, which had his possie in a barn.
'llia other night Cocky commenced shifting bag*
from one end of the barn to the other, and during
the operation the owl caught several mice. Towards
the end an old-man rat scuttled out and was
nailed by the bird. There was a hoarse croak, a
squeal, a fluttering of feathers, and rat and owl
sank in a heap. Investigation showed that Mister
Owl’s beak had neatly severed the rat’s spinal
column, but the rodent’s teeth had slit the wind-
pipe of the owl.
* * * *
“D.F.”: It is popularly supposed that the
pelican lives entirely on fish and other water-
creatures. But his troubles about fish if there are
suitable birds handy. A pelican at the Taronga
Park (Syd.) Zoo lately managed to swallow a
mandarin duck. Out west flocks of pelicans have
made things hum in the ibis rookeries during the
season for young.

“Crabtree”: “A.W.” and “Raggedie Wun”
have been arguing about the origin of “shicker.”
Shikkar was not only a word meaning intoxicated,
but also the name of a wine which probably re-
sembled champagne. Rabbi A. T. Chowdowski, one
of the best Hebrew scholars in Australasia, at
present at Newtown (Sydney), mentioned it in an
anti-Prohibition pamphlet he published in M.L.
when he was shepherding the flock of Israel in the
Shaky Islands.

A Plain
Fact!
ments are classed A 2; and then come a num-
ber of fugitive charmers represented by the
symbols Hi and I*2. The one fact, as it
seems to me, that emerges from all this
analysing and classifying is that, notwith-
standing the lyrical raptures, he was con-
stitutionally incapable of deep and lasting
love for any woman.
What is probably the definitive "Life” in
English of Goethe lias recently been pub-
lished (John Murray). l’rofessor Hume
Brown died in 191 N, before completing it,
hut he left it practically ready for the
printer. There is a prefatory note by Lord
Haldane, who contributes also a chapter on
the Second Part of "Faust.” Collecting
and preparing materials was to Hume
Brown a labor of love passing the love ol'
women, and lie seems to have found a fitting
mate in Lord Haldane. George llem-y
Lewes’s fine book, written 50 years ago, has
long been out of date for the facts of Goethe’s
life. The biography by Joseph McCabe,
though more valuable than lluine Brown’s
mi Goethe as man of science, is much less
impartial. There is a good deal of special
pleading on the ethical aspect, and McCabe
walks very warily among the uglier details
of Goethe’s astonishing relations to women.
With these, as with every other phase of his
hero, Hume Brown deals fearlessly and
faithfully; and little enough is left of the
moral demigod set up by Carlyle. For an
estimate of Goethe's value as man of science
go to McCabe. Into this field the Profes-
sor gazes with the innocent eyes of a child.
In every other respect his work is altogether
excellent, and it is of enthralling interest.
HENRY MOLONY.
The Prophet and the Plates
Long before Jules Verne wrote his “Twenty
Thousand Leagues Under the Sea”- Joseph
Smith, junior, the writer or translator of “The
book of Mormon,” had got next to the idea
of the submarine. In the Book of Ether
he tells us how the people of Jared, who
were scattered abroad at the time of the
building of the Tower of Babel, crossed an
unnamed ocean, apparently the Atlantic, iu
craft “tight like unto a dish” both top and
bottom, how they 7 took in air through a hole
at the top and went “like a whale through
the midst of the sea.” As “The Book of
Mormon” was first published in 1837 therb
is something to be said for Joseph, jun., as
a prophet. lie is there with the goods, too,
when it comes to the remote past. He tells
us how the Nephites came over to what was
apparently U.S.A. and found cows, oxen,
asses, horses and goats there. Since Joseph’s
day scientists have dug up remains showing
that horses and other unexpected beasts did
once flourish in America, though they became
extinct before the discovery by Europeans.
Maybe Joseph’s Nephites and Lamanites and
the rest ate them all.
Christopher Marlowe was held “an atheist
in common repute” in his day because of
some alleged remarks that he could write a
Bible which would be the basis of a better
religion than the Christianity he saw around
him. But what Marlowe only talked about
Joseph Smith attempted. In sheer bulk
“The Book of Mormon” is a remarkable piece
of work for one who was evidently not a
practised writer. The 1913 edition, published
by the Board of Publications of the Church
of Jesus Christ of the Latter-Day Saints,
has 777 pages. A good deal is adapted with-
out much change from the Bible, but Joseph
worked up a lot of new-matter. And in
spite of a deal of tedious repetition it is
worth reading. Of course, Joseph did not
claim to be original: he said he was merely
translating the writings engraved on the
golden plates of Nephi which he dug up some-
where in Illinois (U.S.A. 1. Joseph may
have known Hebrew or whatever language
was used on the golden plates, hut. lie was
shaky on English and fond of such weird
expressions a.s “did engraven.” In the Book
of Mosiah he tells us about a wicked king
who laid on -the citizens a tax of a fifth of
their gold and their silver and their “ziff.”
This doesn’t mean that he shaved their whis-
kers. It must have been a sort of time-pay-
ment system, a.s Ziff is an old Hebrew word
for one" of the months. However, didn’t the
S. M. Herald once write about wayzgeeseY
As to the golden plates (there must have
been a whole street of them to hold the 777
pages) there is a cloud of witnesses. Oliver
Cowdrey, David Whitmer and Martin Harris
testify that they know that the plates “have
been translated by the gift and power of
God. for His voice has declared it unto ns.
Then eight witnesses —four Whitmers, tlr'ee
Smiths and Hiram Page—declare that they
“know of a surety that the said Smith has
got the plates.” The old-timers who did the
engraving evidently knew that Smith and
the Day Saints were coming. The
Book of Jacob winds up with this delightful
touch: “And to the reader I bid farewell,
hoping that many of my brethren may read
my words. Brethren, adieu.”
As an inventor of names Joseph Smith had
a touch of genius. He did not shine so much
with incident. Still, apart from the sub-
marine, there is a good touch about the Hall
of Brass, with a spindle at each end, which
rolled before the Nephites and showed them
which way to go. There are old-world
legends about migrating peoples being
guided in this way (usually by animate
things, though, as the Huns were by the
magic bird) ; but probably Joseph Smith
never read them. Most people associate the
Mormons with the old-time polygamy of Salt
Lake City and Brigham Young’s two dozen
wives, but there is a distinct prohibition of
plurality of wives in the Scripture, according
to Smith, if the 1913 edition faithfully re-
produces the original. For in the Book of
Jacob it is written: “There shall not any
man have save it be one wife, and concu-
bines he shall have none.”
DONALBIN.
Realism in Poetry
To-day there is a growing desire for a
Zola of verse. People are not satisfied to
leave the dregs in the kitchen-sink: they
want to know what the dregs sue and of
what they are composed. "There are all
sorts of interesting things in a heap of offal."
they say; "let's have an analysis of it.”
From the point of view of the archaeologist
this may be praiseworthy; but it is surely
not the function of a poet to satisfy the
craving. Poetry should be, first and fore-
most. song: its appeal aesthetic. Without
necessarily being emotional, it should evoke
a mood. Where the poet sings of love and'
introduces carrots and sexual odors, he
merely evokes discomfort and surprise, file
latter is caused, not by his talent, but by
lus lack of good taste. The Chinese poet Po
Chu-i lauded the smell of his lady’s armpits.
But we are not Chinese.
The opposite tendency, with its draperies
and its Cranford, is Mid-Victorianism. A
stimulus against this came from Kupert
Brooke. That his “Channel Passage” and
“Jealousy” have been quoted so often is
significant, lie was a precursor of the move-
ment. as Meredith and Hardy wore precur-
sors of the modern novel. Amongst his fol-
lowers are Oswald Sitwell (“W heels")-and
Aldous Huxley ("Loda” and “Limbo *.
Take the latter’s lines in "Frascati’s" :
What steam of blood or kidney-pier
Wind blasts of Bantu melody,
and then
.... Wo sit; in blissful calm
Quietly sweating palm to palm.
No one doubts that this is clever ragtime
verse. It was a somewhat similar quality
of cleverness that, characterised the ’nine-
ties. There is also about an equal amount
of sincerity. But from so tine an artist as
Lascelles Abercrombie one expects an avoid-
ance of subjects ;ind subject-matter unsuited
to poetic expression. There is surely no-
thing beautiful, nothing even appealing, in
the conversation that takes place in a bar
between a slattern and a number of drunken
men :—-
“She cannot do it!” one was bawling out:
A glaring hulk of tlesli with a bull’s voice.
He finger’d with ids neckerchief, and stretelit
His throat to ease the anger of dispute.
Then spat to put a full stop to the matter.
It may be, as the author says, “Witchcraft:
X ‘\v Style.” Let us have the old style then.
Sometimes realism that aims at being
excessively sentimental or excessively simple
has the virtue of being genuinely amusing.
We know what happened to Wordsworth’s
blind boy ; and so when Alfred Noyes asks
us to read this we feel instinctively that
tragedy is near at hand:—
For he used to buy the yellow penny dreadfuls.
And teiid them where he fished for conger-eels,
And listened to the lapping of the water.
The green and oily water round the keels.
Alfred’s little boy has a fellow to share his
fate. He appears in Robert Graves’s “Coun-
try Sentiment.” After inquiring the where-
abouts of the page boy of the Hawk and
Buckle, the poet says:—
And what of our young Charlie this hot summer
■weather?
He is bobbing for tiddlers in a little trickle-
truckle.
With his line and his hook and his breeches of,leather.
Were the writer an elderly and inexperienced
sentimentalist who had taken up poetry as
a mission or a hobby, we might forgive him.
But to Graves the absurdity of the lines
must be apparent. Of late we have suffered
much of this sort of thing. There is Saul
Kane the blaggard and little .Jimmy .lag-
gard. There is also Masefield’s blacksmith
who
... .in his sparky forge
Heat on the white-hot softness there;
Ever as he sang an air
To keep the sparks out of his gorge.
Let’s hope lie managed it. Poor chap, he
cannot prevent ours from rising. For sheer
uglineks the l last line rivals Meredith’s "Or
is’t the widowed’s dream of her new mate?”
which Arthur Symons declared to be the
ugliest line in the English language.
WILFRED LEICESTER.
Imports of Foreign Fiction
Australian authors need not waste their
time over pious aspirations. The thing that
will do Australian authors and Australian
readers most good is alteration of present
copyright law to the American plan-—mak-
ing production in Australia the condition
precedent to Australian copyright. Affecting
as it would mostly the rubbish among the
imported books, it would raise the standard
of the Australian reader. The agitation for
such an’ amendment of the law will bring
in the powerful interests of printers and
publishers and enlist the lighting strength of
the typographical unions. If Australia must
have the rubbish of Corelli, Garvice, Ethel
M. Dell and the rest of them, there are
plenty of writers in Australia bad enough to
ensure local supply, and any check to such
supply makes the demand for better work.
So much for book publication : menace of
copyright could not similarly affect most of
the serials and short stories of the imported
magazines, because their stupidity gives
them a copyright anywhere by making them
not worth the stealing. I have just, read
four English magazines, being room-bound
by illness, and ready to read even the adver-
tisements; and here are the contents: —•
1. Ridiculous story of the American West written
by a Cockney who obviously has never been out of
London.
2. Story whose conversational limits I here sample:
“ ‘See that goes now,’ he said. ‘Yes. my lord.'
‘Ask Mr. Todd to come to me; where is he ?’ ‘ln
the library, my lord.’ ‘Then I’ll go to him.’ ‘Yes,
thank you, my 10rd’.... Deane watched John [the
‘niv lord'] cross the room towards her, and liked
his long legs immensely, for they never once got in
his way.”
3. “Humor" heavy as an Argus leader.
4. Ghastly yarn about Muriel Milton and a private
detective named Anthony Tuke; and women just like
that.
.">. “60 seconds and a fighting chance.” Yarn
of a beautiful girl who is a master mariner. “From
her father she had learned all there was to know of
navigation ; the rest came to her by instinct inherited
from generations of seagoing forebears, with a black
crew who feared her and a white mate who would
have died a hundred deaths rather than let a hair
of her head come to harm.. ..she herself had the
heart of a lion." And so on with the ridiculous
female typhoon-beater whose seagoing she-hears make
her exempt from pilotage, and the mate who would
have died a-hundred deaths to save one hair, and
must therefore be ready to die several million times
to save all her wig'. She gives orders this way:
“Up with all sail, Mr. Smithers, and stand by to let
go your ropes."
G. Tender "nature" story of an alligator's love for
her 28 children.
7- Lord Theodore Grantall wants to marry Dorothy
Steele, the actress—his mamma the Dowager-Countess
of Mambury objecting. Love wins as usual, and
without any sacrifice, because Lord Theodore is not
forced to get work, after all.
8. Charles Stobart (miiie-owner) ami Job Matson
(miner) imprisoned in a flooding mine. Stobart
always talks “with a flash of his white teeth," and
naturally he saves the common person.
9. Story of Chinese chasing blokes all over Eng-
land to recover a diamond, weighing 21b. 40z., once
the eye of an idol. All impossible—blokes, diamond
and Pongs. And this sort of thing to end most of
the alleged yarns: “‘I love you enough to die for
you,’ ho gasped ; ‘I love you-r—love you enough to die
for you!,’ ‘Oh!’ she cried panting; ‘l’ve never been
so happy in all my life.’ ”
10. Humorous story by a gloomy person whose
idea of humor is the exploitation of defective teeth.
It is such a wild joke that he repeats it to infinity—
Pearl busily occupied in sucking a back t00th....
“Pearl’s tooth had been his strength in ages
past’’.... “with a final squeak from his second
m01ar".... “A final hiss from Pearl’a second
m01ar".... “Pearl always had liis tootli to fall hack
upon’’. .. .Pearl sucked meditatively at bis
t00th".... “accustomed to the noises of Pearl’s
t00th".... “He fell back upon his tooth’’... .“Pearl
fell upon liis perforated second m01ar”.... “Pearl
looked up, then waved his hand, and fell hack upon
his tooth.” H'- such a fine joke. The mother-in-
law joke and the underclothing joke become too
old even for English magazines, but this perforated
tooth story re-discovers English humor and the
garbage-can joke is still open for exploitation.
State systems of education are of little*
use if these ghastly English magazines are
encouraged to undo the work. The bad
books can he discouraged by making Aus-
tralian production the condition precedent
to Australian copyright: and tin* stupid
imported serial at £lO or so lor 100,000
words can he put out of action by raising
the postage r.nte on Australian newspapers
that, publish more than an agreed maximum
of i'oroi.trn fiction.

“Hamer”: A Lockhart (N.S.W.) farmer.
11. Davies, has hit-on an idea to save sewing
wheat-bags. It is simply two strips of iron,
fitted with twisted ends which lock into one
another. When the bag is filled the mouth
of the sack is caught between the two irons,
the operation taking only a second. Although
the irons are dearer than twine, the inventor
reckons he saves more than the difference in
labor costs.

“Popgo”: My brother brought home a
tin of “paint-remover,” intending to re-
enamel the family bath. He worked
by candle-light, but to be on the safe
side opened both door and window. 1
After working awhile he left the bath-
room, taking the light Avith him. Returning
a minute later he no sooner entered the
dooi’Avay than the whole place burst into
flames. He was badly scorched and his hair
w r as singed off. The paint-remover tin bore
no intimation that the contents were highlv
inflammable, and an application to the
makers for medical exes, met with stony
disdain. This happened 14 months ago, but
the paint-remover tins are still bare of any
Avarning.
“Capricorn”: The Queensland cotton in-
dustry started 93 years ago, Avhen the place
was only Moreton Bay, and this year’s out-
put is 140 tons. That signifies a revival;
but between 1867 and 1874 the yearly
average was near 600 tons, so it also signi-
fies a slump. Little progress is expected,
however, for Queensland has hardly time for
anything except the Golden Casket lottery,
which is now drawn once a fortnight, and
expects soon to draw itself once a day, and
for the horse game, which, instead of being
withered by the Casket game, has grown up
alongside it to stupendous proportions.
Besides, a prolonged strike will be arranged
for as soon as the cotton output reaches 200
tons.

“Sixenate”: There are still a few things
which the Avorld looks to Fritz to supply.
One is cement for tooth-fillings. The Ger-
man cement has been more or less sup-
planted, certainly; but the new product has
a habit of discoloring the filled tooth, and
nobody likes it. One Sydney dentist who
had a large stock of the German material
Was able to sell about a .quarter of it; and
the price he got was so good that he is in
the position of having his cement for nothing.
Yet the making of a good cement in Aus
fralia itself should not present insuperable
difficulties: and, since Australia supports r
Avhole army of dentists, it should be able to
keep a small industry like this going full
time.

trouble is that Australians won’t buy such

days Lake’s Creek did a bit with turtles.

is that Dodge Brothers Motor Car deserves
all the good things that are said of it.
In addition to its good looks, the car has a
wonderful reputation for consistent service.
The petrol consumption is unusually low
The tyre mileage is unusually high.

Force entitled to wear the D.C.M.. M.M..
Cross of St. George and Croix de Guerre is
working in Canterbury (M.L.) as a laborer.
"Well, it s better than starving in the Cold
Country,” lie says.
On September 6, 70 years ago, gold
was discovered at Ballarat. The find made
something of a splash, but the outer ripples
of it didn’t reach Cape Otway. Ford, the
lighthouse-keeper there, got the first news of
it from some newspapers sent him from the
Cold Country.
“Sunnyuncle”: 1 don’t know whether
aspirin is harmful or not. But 1 was sur-
prised to see a woman during an interval
at the pictures pass a bottle round to hei
four kiddies. "Yes,” she was saying to a
friend, "they always get. a headache if they
don’t take them.” From her talk 1 learned
that the youngsters, all under 14. took ou
an average six tablets a week.
The death of Elizabeth Radcliffe at 7.7
recalls an old-time mystery. In the early
days of the Speck her father. James RadclilTe.
settled on tin- east coast. Then he went for
a trip to Ireland and disappeared. He
arranged for sending out the families of two
Irishmen who had been working for him. and
that was the last that was heard of him:
the most diligent inquiries never brought a
clue to light.
One of the dailies described a retiring
Cocky member seeking re-election to the
Assembly as a political bushranger. The
candidate neatly turned the epithet to
account by appearing at a fancy-dress hull
the next night in Ned’ Kelly-like armor made
of cardboard, and got a big ad. out of it.
When polling-day came he downed two
doughty opponents, and is now trailing
ALL.A. after his name as heretofore.
There were MO members of the lirst Leg.
Council under Responsible Government it
.\. S. Wales. They were handed their seats
for five years on May 13, 18515. On May 10,
1S(>1, Charles Cowper, in order to pass the
Robertson Land Bill, tried “a swamp” of 20
new members, but the thing misfired, as all
the sitting members, including the President.
W. W. Burton, retired and left the Chamber
without a quorum. Three days later Time
Vilh-d the House. To-day there are 85
members.
Prof. Peden has been appointed a Commis-
sioner to advise the N.S.W. Government on
the codification of the laws and the removal
of excrescences. Pedfn has often urged the
straightening of the paths which are supposed
to lend to justice; and having been dissoci-
ated from them for some time he is not
obsessed with a reverence for Costs. It is
not intended that the work shall be done in
a hurry; he is to go through the whole
labyrinth, and report as he goes. He has a
chance to do something for which genera-
tions may call him blessed.
"Tin llat”: The recent Vic. municipal
elections led up to a comical situation at
South Melbourne. Labor got a majority of
one, and rejoiced mightily that the mayoralty
was theirs. But one of the Labor members
omitted to attend the first meeting, whereat
the Opposition grabbed the chance to propose
the re-election of the late Mayor. The vot-
ing being a dead heat, the position was bal-
lotted for—and the Labor man drew the
wrong marble. After a few more or less
well-chosen words, the defeated faction left
for home. It even left the good free beer
in which his Bunnyskin’s health was drunk.
“Moe”: After a long struggle the sera
and antitoxins from the Federal Serum In-
stitute in Melbourne are now recognised as
superior to the imported, and at present are
being prescribed in the ratio of about 10 .to
one. The early prejudice was very stupid.
The organism which causes diphtheria in
U.S.A. must differ in some degree from the
one which causes the complaint in Australia,
where conditions are different. And, accord-
ingly’, the vaccine which will give the best
results in Australia will be the one that
has been prepared from the local organism,
not the one obtained from a foreign germ.
“Silas”: In the old Mechanics’ llall at
Ballarat I saw a one-time well-known actress
play 7 Lady Macbeth under the influence of
London gin. The earlier part of the per-
formance was punctuated with hies and
stumbles, but nothing more serious happened
till the sleep-walking scene. The instruc-
tions are “Enter Lady Macbeth with taper, -
and the doctor says: “How comes she by
that light?” Here the audience broke ,in
with the most satisfactory roar of laughter
I have ever heard, for Lady Mac was carry-
ing carefully before her, not a taper, but
a bottle of Old Tom.
If any part of the Ma State which isn't
Sydney or close to Sydney asks the Gov-
ernment for some trifle it isn’t long in learn-
ing what a poor nobody’s-dog sort of place
it is. Murwiliumbah is in the rich X.-E.
corner of the State. (552 miles by mail-route
from the capital, and refused, by reason oi
a gap in the railway line which has bee
carefully preserved for 27 years, access to
Brisbane, about SO miles away. The loca
shire lately applied for permission to raise
a road loan of £50,000 “on the same condi-
tions as loans granted to the County ot
Cumberland” (Sydney’s own county), which
got £500,000. It was promptly told to de-
part into outer darkness, because such a loan
would be “at the expense of the whole pi
the people of the State”—just like Cumber-
land’s.
Exclusiveness can have its disadvantage a •
A MeiDourne medico bought a certain make of
car, the only one of its kind here-
abouts, and lie found it a distinctive
advertisement. But not long afterwards
Sawbones, who in private life is one of
the pillars of the church, sensed a changed
attitude towards him in many of his friends,
the younger ones being inclined to treat him
with a certain levity, while older ones of a
pious disposition regarded him as a back-
slider. Finally matters were brought to a
climax by ■ a heart-to-heart talk with his
clergyman, who accused him of frequenting
not-quite-nice places in the suburbs. Saw-
bones was staggered and started an investi-
gation, which led to the discovery that his
chauffeur had been in the habit of whiling
away his idle hours in certain Pagan temples
and leavin o ' the boss’s distinctive car stand-
ing outside. The chauffeur is now looking
for another job, and Sawbones has already
got another motor, this time so common that
the traffic doesn’t know it’s there.

CLARA BUTT
pays a warm tribute to
Columbia Records
ş
IT is rare, indeed, for any instru-
ment or appliance to receive
so enthusiastic a testimonial as
is conveyed by the above letter.
This is particularly impressive, be-
cause, in the matter of the recording
of her voice—by which she will be
judged now and in time to come —
the great artist would naturally be
acutely critical.
The claim that a Columbia Record
is a reproduction of the artist’s
‘ ‘living tones” receives a striking
endorsement by this unqualified
tribute of Clara Butt.

Uncle Sam’s War Department is as casual
as the rest of them. To J. R. Padgett, a
soldier-settler at Piesse’s Brook (W.A.), it
has sent along, without any preliminary
warning, one of its rare bronze crosses for
“extraordinary heroism in the attack on
the Hindenburg line” and for saving a
wounded doughboy under heavy fire.
Had Donald Mackinnon followed the
example of Vic. Treasurer McPherson and
left behind him a signed nomination-paper it
looks as though P’ran would have been an
easy snap for him. Military-surgeon R. H.
Fetiierston, a political novice and the poorest
of platform men, recovered the seat from
Labor by a majority of 147. With two Lib-
eral docs, in the Assembly and one Farmers
Union sawbones in the Council, the State
Parliament has more medical attention than
it has had for years. ,
Oscar Bailey, who lately left Federal
Hansard to head the Commonwealth law-
reporting staff, first practised his Pitman
on an Adelaide daily and did a lot of Han-
sard work for the South Aus. Covernment
before moving east. Bailey, whose round,
red cheeks and flowing mo. remind one of
pictures of Gustave Flaubert, is accom
panied on his new job by R. P. Sholl, an-
other S. Australian who was on Federal
Hansard for 13 years. Prior to that he
spent some of his past on the Argtjs.
In one respect nearly all the Liberal
candidates at the State elections in Mel-
bourne fared alike. Whether he won or lost
the Liberal candidate couldn’t get a hearing
after the declaration of the poll. Even when
he tided to second the vote of thanks to the
retu'rning-oflicer he was boohooed into in-
audibility. If political issues could be
decided by “interruptions” Labor would
wipe the floor with its opponents, and that’s
not a nice thing to have to say of a party
which came into being to appeal for Reason.
“Hamer” : The old gasometer in the Hay-
market, Sydney, is passing out. Last year
it sprang a leak somewhere near the top,
and the escape in some mysterious way
caught fire; and then people speculated about
what would happen to the neighborhood, in-
cluding Central Railway Station, if the big
bomb blew up. The barrel was erected in
1872, being the second in Sydney (the one
in Kent-street was an ancient by that time),
and it reached 80ft. above the ground level.
The 30ft. pit in which it sits is to be the
basement of a big block of buildings for the
Gas Co.
Frank B. Smith, editor of the new maga-
zine whose purpose in life is to cry for
better roads in N. S. Wales, was once pri-
vate secretary to Railway Commissioner
Tait, and edited the Victorian Railway
Institute Review. Having the knack of
taking it down rapidly, he became a licensed
shorthand reporter for the Supreme Court
of Vic., and when in U.S.A. reported for the
Federal Grand Jury. As a song-writer he
has supplied topical verses £o comedians
from the days of Neil Kenyon and Jack
Cannot to those of George Gee and Jennie
Hartley.
N. S. Wales Bankruptcy Registrar F. H.
Sa|usbury, who has gone on leave prior to
retirement, came to Australia about 30 years
back. On three occasions he acted as Regis-
trar, in the absence of Arthur Henry, before
he got the job permanently 13 years ago. He
has also acted as Master in Equity, and is
the author of a sound work on Bankruptcy
Practice. Very few of his judgments have
been challenged; but one notable case went
through to the High Court —and came out in
his favor. The age limit, which has been
underwritten in the Public Service from
the usual thixe-sOore and ten to 65, steps in
and cuts short a successful career.
"Lone Woman” : The long arm of coinci-
dence strained its elbow in the gallery of
Her Majesty’s (Melb.) the other night. I
had gone early with the object of avoiding
the crush. I have no male escort. I took
up a position with a small, highly-colored
woman on my right. A brisk body, possibly
40, came in later. We started confidentially
on the weather and prevailing ailments, and
she grew communicative. I had her history
before the curtain was up. She was recently
back from the West, mainly to secure a
divorce from “that wretch” on account of
his goings-on with a party she had never
seen. In the interval I went after the boy
with the chocolates, and as I was returning
to my seat the eruption occurred. It was
as you have guessed; my little friend had
hit upon the co-re.
“D.F.”: It is sad to see what shore life
and a good Government job may do to a man.
When Captain John King Davis was buck-
ing up and down from the Antarctic in the
old Aurora, punching that ancient tub
through blizzards and big seas and dodging
icebergs and whales, he was a long, lean,
angular, lantern-jawed skipper with a Cap-
tain Kettle beard, and looked as though lie
might have made a good pirate if he had
been brought up that way. Now that he
has a snug office billet as Director of Navi-
gation. he wears a bowler hat and a nobby
suit, shaves every morning and is growing
like the ordinary taxpaying shore-biped. He
is still long and lean, but the angles aren’t
so angular. The degeneration might be more
rapid if his job didn’t call for occasional
runs to Cooktown and such places.
It having been necessary to abandon the
more sensational features of the N.S.W.
Lands Confiscation scheme before J. Bull
would lend any more money, the tendency
now is to profess that they were really very
mild features, so that nothing much has been
abandoned —that the measure was rather a
lamb than a lion. Thus the newspaper re-
port reads that Premier Storey explained
the new situation to the Caucus and—
The party then endorsed the agreement made by*
the Premier while in England in respect to a modifi-
cation .... The Bill provided that no person or com-
pany. .. .should be allowed to hold more than
JJ 20,000 worth of land a cording to its fully-improved
value as on, December 30, 1020, and that the balance
should be resumed by the State.
This is the sort of juggling with words
which makes the Storey Ministry so un-
trustworthy. Clause 6 said that the area
allowed to be retained “shall not exceed in
value the sum of £20,000, such value being
computed os if the area were freehold and
fully improved." It might not be freehold,
and the special Court might dec’d Q tb*rt if
fully improved fbv irrigation or otherwise)
the soil might be worth £lOO per acre. So
the owner might be left a mere fragment
worth a lot if he had a fortune to spend on
it. but worth very little to raise the fortune
on.

pre-eminence was asserted in the pioneer
days of motor-car building. Then it was
hailed as a British achievement, and time
has shown it to be a permanent and
eloquent tribute to the British Engineer-
ing and Designing brains that conceived it and to the British
hands that give it shape.
With the years the Wolseley has forged ahead. A constant refinement, a
steady improvement, aided by tremendous experience in building Vickers-Vimy
Aeroplanes for the Vickers-Vimy Company during the Great War, have enabled
it not only to maintain its definite superiority, but to soar even higher above
the best of its contemporaries.
The Wolseley has earned the names The Classic Car and The Quality
Car“ not through sturdy, artistic appearance alone, but through its classic,
handsome beauty being equalled only by its quality of construction and engine
perfection.
Get behind the wheel of a Wolseley and drive. A quick, easy start, smooth,
free running, responsiveness and .flexibility of power, together with the appeal
of its distinctive beauty and luxurious appointments will urge you to make the
Wolseley your selection, a choice which will inspire in you always a justifiable
pride of possession.
You are cordially invited to call on the nearest Wolseley Representative,
who will gladly demonstrate the Wolseley 4 s value to you.

DAILY HOT WATER is a NECESSITY
makes things move smoothly in the kitchen for cooking and
cleaning— lightens the work in the laundry—and comforts
and refreshes in the bathrooms. Establishments catering for
public support without an adequate hot-water service cannot
be said to be giving that degree of ordinary comfort demanded
by the traveller and tourist.
Ideal Hot Water Supply
••Ideal” boilers will supply from 20 to 2000 gallons
of heated wholesome water per hour, according
to size, and whether for family or public use.
They burn coal, coke or wood, as well as com-
bustible household rubbish, and require little
attention. The slow-combustion principle burns the
fuel to a fine ash and reduces fuel bills —in some
instances by half.
An “Ideal” installation will reduce your working
expenses, attract new business, and pay for itself.
Send a rough plan of your requirements, and we will
submit an approximate price and plan by an
experienced heating expert.
Our advice costs nothing—take advantage of it

Vi ere there any doubt about the true
character of “Ilis Lady Friends,” staged at
Melbourne Royal on Saturday night, the
larce should be given the benefit of it for
the sake of Joseph Coyne. Joseph works
hard afid fast and entertainingly in the part
of a simple-minded husband, in the Rible
trade,: whose simpler-minded wife has no
use for his money. Other nice girls want
cash assistance badly, and his harmless en-
deavors to gladden their young lives get him
into the same sort of difficulty that kept
him always on the move in “Nightie Night.”
Something of reality attaches to Jimmy
Smith (Coyne) and his drab-colored spouse
(Blanche Browne) in the first place. The
hold, blonde, expensive wife (Marie La
Varre) of Jimmy’s lawyer-friend (Sidney
Stirling) is but a conventional ’Murkan
type of domestic suffragette, while the law-
yer is _ a mere stereotyped scapegoat, and
Marjorie Bennett is just a winsome uncer-
tainty, neither child, flapper nor good young
woman, who bolts to the seaside with Jimmy
and excites false-suspicions in a stage bath-
ing outfit. But Jimmy and his wife remain
fairly human until three wild women come
out of the West to get more dollars from tile
rich Samaritan, and Mrs. Jimmy, hastily
assuming that they are victims of the law-
yer, insists on, taking them all home to five
with her, after which the farce grows weari-
some, save at odd moments. No air of pro-
bability 'cymes.to cool its baby brow. The
joyful, cuddlesome uncertainty is suddenly
converted into a sober-minded fiancee at the
instance of a mock-melodramatic youth
(Lance, Lister) in man’s clothing; the loud
and costly suffragette crumples into tears at
the thought of her childlessness, and Blanche
Browne, is metamorphosed into a vision
of latest Paris fashion, with a .bountiful
moral yearning to help Jimmy spend the
proceeds of his Bible trade. Finally, the "pro-
ducer” of the misguided show conies on the
stage to announce that it is a comedy
and not a farce. Nobody, not even
Coyne in all his stunts, is so funny as the
producer who refers to “Ilis Lady Friends”
as a comedy rather than a farce. Why any-
one should come all the way from America
to stage such old-style foolishness is a ques-
tion not answered by Rubi Treleasc, Clarice
Hardwieke and Gwen Burroughs as they
stand iii a row striving to keep the audi-
ence’s boredom at bay. Coyne’s speech last
Saturday night provided sufficient opening
fdr the audience to respond heartily to a wily
suggestion, but _ the responsive applause was
so silent you might have heard a pin drop.

her golden notes
on Debussy’s
“Mandoline.” Bom-
berg’s “Nymphes
et Sylvains.” and
Hahn’s “Si Mes
Vers Avaient des Ailes,” which only
made the audience hungry for more. John
Lemmone fluted beautifully with the assist-
ance of Alberto Zelman’s orchestra, which
also chaperoned Una Bourne’s brilliant
frisk through Liszt’s “Hungarian Fantasy.”
Zelman’s army, including many white-clad
damsels, started the evening in Schubert’s
"Bosamunde” Overture and finished an exact-
ing programme with a not always impec-
cable performance of the introduction to the
Third Act of "Lohengrin.” In the more
appealing Largo from Dvorak’s "New World”
Symphony that followed Melba’s "Otello”
selections, Dr. Itudall earned the audience’s
thanks for his English horn solo.
“Chu Chin Chow,” with its gorgeous full
stages, its black-outs and glowing insets, is
ro try its effects at .Melbourne Majesty’s on
Saturday. Those unimpressionable citizens
who were not charmed by the rich novelty
when they saw it at the Tivoli are advised
to see it some more, and the other people
require no urging, "The Lilac Domino” is
off on its travels.
“Scandal” goes on Saturday to Melbourne
Princess’s, commencing with a matinee.
Bert Bailey and Co., in “Jefferson Wins
Through,” are to take the floor at Melbourne
King’s as soon as the Bed is out of the way.
The advt. gives a list of reasons why Mel-

unduly stressing the fact that the pla'y comes
within the British preference category, and
haS no American millionaires in it.
At Melbourne Tivoli the new vaudeville gets
a boost from a bill which centres in Wilkie
Bard, and is best when it stays there. Three
new turns and another pleasing variation of
Moon and Morris pave the way for the prin-
cipal man. Caffrey, disguised as an Irish
fiddler, .tells yarns which sometimes sound
fresh, in a voice that never fails to sound

The Vic. Artists’ 1!>21 show:—
In the Vic. Artists’ exhibition this year the half-
hearted and perfunctory performances outnumber the
< efforts of real worth. In fact, the Society has evi-
dently lowered its standard to provide enough pic-
tures to fill two galleries. All departments show a
serious drop in achievement. The most conspicuous
•canvas is Charles Wheeler’s well-painted portrait of
a small boy.seated on a large chair; and even that
is , not very impressive. Wheeler is also responsible
for some minor landscapes which are slick and master-
ful in technique and in a couple of samples depict
the lyric greens of Spring. Miss Teague, who usually
• sends an interesting portrait, doesn’t score a bull’s-
eye,, with a picture of a red-faced gentleman; and
T. Carter’s more ambitious “Portrait .T. S. Davie,
Esq.,” is less successful than it would have been
liqd he been kinder to’the model's jaw and painted
the shadowy left hand more carefully. Captain
Symons, V.C., bv Mrs. Symons, is more convincing.
K- Growcott’s portrait of a red-eloaked maiden
leaves more art to be desired. “Nearing Her Cen-
tury,” E. Lakeland’s study of an old lady, seems
faithful in its flesh tones, but is not otherwise arrest-
ing. There is some solid painting in George Coates’s
“Druid.” who has an unhealthy complexion and sports
a beard like a waterfall. Among the prizetakers in
landscape Victor Zelman is most effective in a canvas
portraying a warm light in a smiling world. W.
Delafield Cook is an industrious craftsman, but his
palette can’t keep cool, and there is a want of
variety in his subjects. R. Buckmaster continues
his series of aeroplane views of curving farmscapes,
and the manner of the handling resembles colored
photography. Taylor Ghee is the pictorial Laureate
of Melbourne’s streets, turning busy sections into
queer pea-tinted poems. R. McCann doesn’t forget
his artistic kinship with Meldrum in “Crueset’s Cow
Paddock.” Rose Lowcray stresses a pale sky in
her “Afterglow;” but the landscape-is pleasing. Nora
Gordon’s “Mountain Mists, Toolangi,” is also like-
able in its restraint, and F. G. Reynolds’s “Sea
Study” is exemplary in its veracity. Nothing takes
the eye in the small overflow in the Central Gallery,
and the South Gallery is crammed with water-colors
and pastels, most of which one wishes to forget.
But Harold Herbert’s collection invites several in-
spections, and the works of Joan Weigall, Claire
Scott and R. W. Sturgess are worth their place upon
the walls. M. \V. O’Connell’s effusions have a raw
brilliancy, but his sense of color is undeniably strik-
ing. The pastel nudes of Cumbrae Stewart and Bell
Moore are anatomically correct, but neither of the
models would lure an impressionable critic from
home. An honorable mention is due to Clarice
Beckett for “Almond Blossom,’’ the best still-life
in the exhibition.
Dame Clara Butt opened her Australian
season at the Sydney Town Hall on a burst
of llarulel and
Gluck that swept
the hmi s e into
roars of applause
and brought down
ui)on her a legion
of ushers, each
bearing a minia-
ture horticultural
show. The double
encore resulted in
Brahms’ “Sunday”
and ,-i Russian lul-
laby. Among the
inevitable group of
baby-songs was the
delightful story of
the purchases that
a fairy brought
home from market.

chorus. Kennerley Kumford renewed ac-
quaintance in Handel’s “ Where’er You
Walk, and made that number as perfect as
is humanly possible. Farrar’s setting of
L. v. Lucas’s "Brittany” was exquisite, and
so was the old-time "When the .Swallows
Homeward Fly.” The singers have a re-
markable accompanist in Grace Torrens, who
seemed to have robbed a bed of pansies for
her dress at the opening concert. Violinist
Me Isa became a favorite from his first note,
and lived up to expectations. Saturday’s
overflowing audience got its thrill from the
moment, the Dame, wrapped about in what
looked like a rosy cloud, her ears fastened on
securely by a pair of wings, .stepped forward.
I oldowski’s “L’Heure Exquise,” sung in
tones as dusky gold as a bee’s wing, opened
the programme: and after a bit of Rach-
maninoff, Beethoven filled the hall like a
mighty wind. Perhaps the clearest gems
of the evening were the Brahms group bv
Kennerley Rumford, who also deserved
the loud hand for his singing of "Sea
Fever,” that hatmtingly beautiful poem of
John Masefield. Grace Torrens, Melsa and
Ernest Truman (at the organ) added to the
joy of the evening.
At Sydney Criterion Marie Tempest and
Graham Browne are- for this week joyously
entangled in “The Marriage of Kitty,” anil
after seeing the clothes Marie Tempest
wears as the “wife of convenience” the girl
in the flat next door says she’ll answer the
first ad. for a wife of that sort that the
Herald publishes.
Though “Oh. Lady, Lady!” at the
Theatre Royal, Sydney, is hardly a - model of
propriety, she continues to show by giving
eight performances weekly that ghe lias law-
ful and visible means of support.
The rustle of paper money and the chink
of silver are still heard copiously at Her
Majesty’s, Sydney, the town having taken
"The Maid of the Mountains,’’ in a manner
perfectly respectable, to its capacious bosom.
Except for an unimportant topical
gazette, Sydney Tivoli gives itself wholly to
vaudeville this week. Foremost on the bill
are Mr. and Miss Tree, “mentalists,” who
furnish a remarkable turn; the latter will
correctly guess that it is a smooth traybit
you are handing her brother, or that you
would like a bit of pickled pork for supper.
And there is always Annette the Mermaid
Queen, who if she could dredge up a toler-
ably good singer for the Tivoli programme,
would add to the debt that this house owes
her.
The critic at Sydney’s biggest picture-
show :—■
The Society of Artists would have justified its
existence if it had s o far done nothing beyond organ-
ising the important exhibition which opened at _ the
Education Galleries on Saturday. The best known
of our painters, including those who have been for
some years in Europe, are well represented, and
the show presents an excellent opportunity for the
now necessary readjustment of idols. There is much
to be learned from careful comparisons by artist,
critic and public, and Australian art should benefit
considerably as a result. The average work is much
tne same as that of previous years, for some of the
bigger men have fallen back and so reduced whir
would otherwise have been a higher average.
tue artist lacks the courage to paint a nearly-wnn’e
sky nearly white, and substitutes a mellow oram-e
or green or dull blue, following the same modify n
Process throughout the picture, and thus general]”
succeeding in robbing his art of much of its po-.
sible vitality.
important People,” by George Lambert, is the
first picture to take the attention, chiefly because 11
is a direct challenge to established ideas and the
normal vision, and has obviously been conceived aid
painted with that object. To appreciate this pic-
ture it is necessary to force tlic mind to accept the
doetrines of a school of thought—to force the mind
since it is not easy to convince oneself, for instance’
that human beings and all objects are nearly Hat and
that a pugilist s arms, a young woman and a bain
have no blood. Only a clear, normal vision is neces-
sary for the appreciation of art; wherefore, if we
compare good prints of a Rembrandt, a Velasquez
and a Titian, we find that the pleasure we get from
each is identical. After studying the Rembrandt ; t
is not necessary to discard our thoughts and etnbrac„•
new ones when we approach the Titian, nor is any
readjustment of ideas necessary when we go on in
the Velasquez. Their outlook may have differed
slightly, but all three agreed that an illusion ot
actual life was the thing of greatest importance. They
discovered the secret of illusion in Tone (relative
values of Light and Dark), and the fruits of their
research in tin's (at that time) comparatively new
dimension of art -brought to us another aspect of
Nature and developed our vision to that extent. So
'Tone lias become the great problem with which we,
too, must concern ourselves, for to us now it is
not possible to record either true form (except
in the outline, ■ which is only a half-statement of
form) or true color without it. In Lambert’s
‘‘important People” he lias made but little effort
to give us any illusion. To him the outline seems
all important, and ill this critic’s judgment it puts
his art (and that of many other so-called decorative
artists exhibiting) somewhere about 400 years behind
the times.
Lambert’s extraordinary facility is in this show
only comparable with, the remarkable handling of
tlie line in Norman Lindsay’s pen-drawings and the
Washes in his water-colors. But deft handling is,
after all, a much over-rated quantity: what is of
greater importance is whether what is handled is
right. Stand before Lambert’s “An Arrangement of
Old English Cottage Flowers” (No. 20) and, after
giving it and its exquisite execution due thought and
appreciation, look over to the opposite wall in the
larger room to the “Flowers and Fruit” (No. 99)
by Hans lleysen, and “Hydrangeas” (No. 100) rty
Max Meldrum. Lambert, barely exploiting Tone,
gives us little more than a beautifully-drawn and
colored plan of his subject. Heysen attempts to
envelop his in tone, but, though it too is other-
wise well painted, it fails to give us the desired
illusion, and every individual in his orchestra more
or less plays solo. Because of this his work here be-
longs to the same stage in the history of art as that
reached by the old Dutch still-life painters. Mel-
drum, too, envelops his “IJydrangeas” in tone, but
paints no part that is not in its right relation to
the whole picture, and gives us an astonishing im-
pression of a real bowl with real’ hydrangeas in it.
Meldrum’s work is of a higher standard than that
reached by any other of the 226 exhibits. We may
feel a lack of color in his portraits and in one land-
scape, “Autumn, Brittany” (No. 147) ; hut taking
true color as' the standard by which to judge, his
bare statement of it does not err so greatly as the
generally over-colored, work around it. AVe need only-
study his “Self Portrait” (No. 117) a few moments
to have all ideas of color give place to an impres-
sion of the actual man before us : and that is suffi-
cient proof of the rightness of his color. This pic-
ture’s immediate neighbors are “Morning on the
Coast” (No. 115) by r Howard Ashton, which, owing
to a greater regard for values, marks a considerable
advance in his work; “Portrait Group” (No. 118) by
Leason; and a Portrait (No. 119) by Norman
Carter, which is only eclipsed as a development in
his work by the “Self Portrait” (No. 145 a). But
whatever their merits, Meldrum’s picture makes them
all look crude and discordant. Meldrum's actual
painting (especially in his two large landscapes)
lacks the dash and brilliance that will be found in
other exhibits. But from the record of his first
impression to the stage where he feels he can not
accurately record more and determines the point at
which he stops, his attitude is that of the humble
student who knows nothing of his subject and must
therefore go cautiously.
Cruner’s work, more especially' in his large canvas,
“The Valley of the Tweed”"(No.-14)3_), falls below the
standard of his “Morning Light” in the Sydney Gal-
lery. It barely loses the fiat surface, and his light,
by comparison with that in “Afternoon” (No. 149)
by Meldrum, “Landscape” (No. 76)’ by R. S.
Wakelin, or “Morning on the Coast” iby Howard
Ashton, is. quite {unconvincing. The .same criticism
applies, in a lesser degree to the cleverly painted
though somewhat careless “Red Gum Tree” (No. 97)
by Arthur Streeton, and to a greater ‘degree than
in either case to the two landscapes (Nos. 96 and
98) by, Lambert.
The balance of the remaining outstanding work
of the exhibition is to be found in Norman Carter's
“Self Portrait,” Lor.gstafFs “Portrait” (No. 88),
Norman' Lindsay’s - remarkable pen-drawings, Street-
on’s “Digger’.’ (No. 23), one or two of Lionel Lind-
say’s and 'Sydney Ure Smith’s, etchings and in most
of Heysen’s work. • • ’

“0.K.”: Operatic tenor-singing doesn’t
seem to be the healthiest trade in the
world. Caruso has been followed into the
shades by Joseph Mann, Germany’s leading
tenor. The finale to the second act of “Aida”
was too much for him, and he fell dead.
Something of the same sort happened to
Larizza—Commendatore Larizza —who came
to Australia with the company that included
llani and Bassich, the original Mimi in this
country. Larizza, most robust and vocifer-
ous of tenors, broke a blood vessel on the
stage not long after his return to Italy. But
it is only the men who kill themselves with
their too strenuous efforts. No prima donna
does herself to death with a top note,
although many of them are short-necked and
perilously plump.
“Jane Ibb”: Bill Anderson, pioneer of
three-two-and-one bellowdrama, is casting
round for an open-air location in or near
Sydney for a summer dramatic season. He
plans, to run open-air drama in the warm
weather in Adelaide, Melbourne and Sydney
simultaneously.
“Hamfat”: Dorothy Brunton, who came
back to Australia on an old contract just
when she had made a success in London, is
off again before the end of the year. She is
passing from the stage to the all-conquering
films. A brothel", who was in the A.I.F. and
was located at Horseferry-road when
Dorothy made her bow in England, is already
working on the pictures in Los Angeles, and
his sister has a,contract in her peggy-bag
which will enable the family to fix a hearth
in the American town for a year or so.
“OH, LADY, LADYr

Old Melba stories are being revived furi-
ously just now, of course. One tells of the
making of a player-piano man happv for life.
He was feasted on guineas-and-guineas’
worth of the Voice all to himself. Before
Melba arrived home at Coombe on one occa-
sion a couple of player-pianos were sent up
in the hope of a word of praise as an ad.
The agent-man, who was a superb demon-
strator, sat himself down in the Diva’s
music-room to try over an instrument before
leaving, and while he was at it he heard a
movement behind and the exclamation
“Good!” With her hat and coat still on,
Melba began to rummage through his rolls,
and, instead of kicking out the trespasser,
she sang to his excellent accompaniment for
two solid hours.
“Minim”: The accomplished French com-
poser Andre Messager died in Paris in the
last week of July, aged OS. His best-known
works are “Veronique” and “The Little
Michus,” and the scores of these real comic-
operas are a treat for any musician to dip
into. Messager, almost as well known in
London as in his native land, was manager
at Covent Garden from 1001 to 1007, and
in addition to conducting the orchestra' was
for some time director of the Paris'Grand
Opera House. lie married an English-
woman who wrote many popular draw.ng-
room ballads under the name of Hope
Temple.
“C. Orkney”: Yet another of the Pinero
farces done in Australia in the distant
Brough and Boucicault days has been turned
into a mus.cal comedy—“ The Schoolmis-
tress.” It has been adapted and the harm-
less necessary lyrics attached to it by Percy
Greenbank. The music is by the always-
melodlous Howard Talbot, who, though he
has written many scores, has yet to submit
one more acceptable than that of “The
Arcadians.”
“J.F.11.” (Lond.) : Sixty-four years have
passed since Ellen Terry made her first ap-
pearance at Manchester, and the management
of the Cottonopolis Gaiety tempted her with
the offer of a
week’s engagement
by way of cele-
brating the anni-
versary. It was
a, painful exhibi-
tion. Only with
the greatest diffi-
culty was she able
with assistance to
ascend a little dais
erected for her ip
the centre of the
orchestra, and front,
there she made an
attempt to recite;;
three Sha k s-
pearean selections.
But her memory'
repeatedly failed
her, and she had
frequently to hunt,
with the ai i of a
pair of large tor-
toise-shell spec-
tacles, for the

large sheets of
fo'oiscap spread out

indicating that the effort was too much for
her. A deplorable anti-climax to a brilliant
career, and one that the old lady should
never have been led into.
“Lud”: Synge’s “The Playboy of the
Western W orld,” which has not been seen on
any play bill in the Southern world, so far as
I am aware, was recently revived at the
Court. Theatre, London, by dramatist-
manager James Bernard Fagan. Sara All-
good, who was one of the original Dublin
cast, took up her old part. Later on Aus-
tralia’s “Peg” was to go touring with the
successful “White-Headed Boy.”
“B.” : Before he took to the showman’s life
for good the ancient George Buller (B.
8/9/ 21) was commercial master at All
Saints’ Grammar School, St. Ivilda, and had
a hand in the education of some well-known
men of the present day. Among his old
scholars are Admiral Gaunt; iuaior-General
Parnell, late of Duntroon and now Adminis-
trator of Norfolk Island; Major-General
Tivey; H. H. Newton, Chief Clerk of the
Vic. Parliament: Vic. Surveyor-General
Lang; and Arthur Wadsworth, Federal Par-
liamentary Librarian. Alfred Deakin joined
All Saints’ staff towards the end of Bulier’s
career there, and helped the nippers over the
hurdles of the classical languages.
“O. Blin” : At the Melbourne Bijou a critic
who had given a show seven days to live
called round a couple of nights after to see
if his prophecy would be fulfilled. He was
just over the doorstep when the angry man-
ager spotted him from the top of the marble
staircase and warned him to retire while he
was yet whole. “Dori’t come in here,” yelled
the injured magnate “even your dirty criti-
cism is better than your company.” “Cer-
tainly,” replied the pressman. "All the same,
my company is better than yours.”
“Black Out”: “Norbell’s” Little Willie
(B. l/9/’23 ) recalls another. He was
caught because the little girl who was going
to play the part got mislaid, and he consented
to die for a bag of peanuts. He got them—
and ate them all through the scene. When-
ever the voice under the bed spoke, up
bobbed the dying angel-child in surprise/pea-
nuts and all. No one had told him to expect
the voice under the bed. Lady Isabel was
holding that kid down before the scene was
over. She killed him at last with, “Lie down.
you little . If you don’t keep still I’ll
strangle you.”
“B.”: Fred Dampier, son of Alfred, and a
popular Warrigal in his dad’s “Robbery
L'nder Arms,’ had a queer’ misadventure in
his far-off youth. When Fred was a babe in
arms, his mother, long known to the stage
as Katherine Russell, took him to the theatre
and left him in the care of the nearest mum-
mer available while she did her bit as the
heroine. One night the infant was bestowed
on a mummer playing a pol.ceman, who,
hearing his cue, and finding no other nurse
to take the boy, hastily bestowed him in a
wardrobe basket and dashed in. A minute
later the wardrobe mistress dropped some
garments on the slumbering Fred, locked the
basket, and sent it off to the train, bound for
the company’s next stand. Then the heroine
came off and asked for her property. The
subsequent row bioke all Damp.er’s records,
and the whole cast streamed away in pursuit
of the absent heir. Ide was collected at. the
railway stat.on, none the worse for his large
allowance of bedclothes.
"Air,idle Blue”: Eileen Robinson, the Syd-
ney ‘girl just home from U.S.A. successes,
g„t her first real chance in “Sweet Laven-
der” with the Buckler-Pagets. She and pic-
ture-actress Sylvia Bremer were kid-ama-
teurs about the same time. Sylvia pinned
up her curls to join a J.C.W. co,
“T.W.” i In London theatres “evening
dress” is now as much the exception as it is
in Australian showplaces. Tnose who do
persist in the magpie faction are mostly
visitors, including returned ex-lx>ndoners,
who take to the Large Fog the "opera
cloaks” of 30 years back, and think thev
must wear them, together with a red
sdk hanky stuffed in above their food-berths.
You may diagnose Australian statesmen in
Downing-street by the same kind of thing.
British Ministers nowadays go in for a com-
fortable neglige: the only one who sticks
to silk hat. and frock coat day in and day
out is Foreign Secretary Curzon, and he
would stick to anything that, was pompous
and awful.
“Billy T.”: A man had fallen out of the
dress-circle of the old Melbourne Bijou dur-
ing a performance of somd sensational drama
that was playing to wretched houses, and had
been carried behind to be doctoied. It was
found that the man had broken his collar-
bone. Then Alf Woods, who was actor-
manager, stand.ng over the sufferer, said re-
provingly : “Th's sort of thing is all very
well on off nights, my man, but see you
don’t do it on Saturdays. Y’ou might fall on
someone in the stalls then, and I wouldn’t
have our stalls patron injured for anything.”
“S.S.” i Alfred Dampier was the Hamlet
of the evening, and his daughter Rose the
ample Ophelia. Alfred had come to the
grave and was moralising over poor Yorick’s
brain-pan, when a new stage-hand, in shirt,
trousers and boots, with sleeves rolled up
and a face as grimy as Elizabeth-street on a
hot-wind day, pushed himself into view.
Hamlet disregarded him. '‘Boss!” he said.
The moody Dane was deaf. The new hand
beckoned. The Prince of Denmark was blind.
Pie moved a step further on to the stage and
whispered, “There’s a bloke out there says he’s
got to see you. He says”— Here Horatio
laid rough hands on the non-professional,
hustling him off, while Hamlet said in Ham-
let’s own manner, “Hurt not the poor hind,
Horatio. He is an idiot of the village who
these three years hath Had largess of me.”
Then, in a fierce aside: “Kick the damned
fool into the middle of next month.”
“The Oldest Inhabitant”: The tercen-
tenary of the birth of Shakspeare was
celebrated in Melbourne in April, 1564,
at the Theatre Royal, under Barry Sul-
livan’s management. The curtain-raiser
was the introduction to the “Taming
of the Shrew,” then played for the
first time in Australia. Herbert Palmer,
of the Age literary staff, was the Christopher
Sly (Palmer was a chum of Marcus Clarke
and Harold Stephen ). S. 11. Banks, a
minor poet, was the Sh.vlock in “The Mer-
chant of Venice”; and I spoke an epilogue
written by James Smith, of the Argus. •
“Leo K.”: There is a tug-of-war in Hobart
over Sunday pictures. The wowsers- want
them abolished, and the anti-wowsers, in-
cluding the picture-show proprietors, object.
The p.-s. proprietors, as a compromise, in-
vited the clergy to step on to the boards and
address the audiences for 10 minutes every
Sunday evening while the operators went out-
side for a smoke. But the clergy stood off.
The p.-s. proprietors pointed out that as
the picture shows attracted more people than
the churches, they (the clergy) would have
larger congregations than they could ever
hope for in their own pews. Even this piece
of diplomacy failed to fetch the clergy. They
stuck to their churches, and the congrega-
tions stuck to the picture shows.

assist, gratuitously, at a charity lucre-chase
in the Town Hall. They went along and
started in on their entertainment with such
effect that they were soon the chief attrac-

organisers rushed over to them, and with-
out apology or preliminaries, told them to

What the .rrmm’selles said as they trooped

Hector St. Clair, a “ vordville ” violinist of

“Alwyn” : I recall various papers chroni-
cling the death of Eric Maxon at the war.
Yet the New 1'ork Dramatic Mirror says
someone of this name is playing the part of
Ellery in “The Skylark” at the Belmont
Theatre. He is credited with much success,
and as the name is an unusual one I find
myself wondering.
“Yarra Ben”: Picture plays and their
hair-raising ads, have, not got a monopoly of
divorce scenarios, after ail. A lady clerk
at a private Conservatorium of Music in
Sydney sought an order in Melbourne Prac-
tice Court the other day declaring her mar-
riage null and void. Her counsel, in making
the application, detailed a complex situa-
tion thus : “This was a bigamous marriage.
The man lived with her only three days and
then went off with the wife of another
gentleman!”
"Pink”: Where does the U.S.A. get its
screen stars? Well, Marc McDermott used
to run a barber’s shop in Woolloomooloo.
vv ill Rogers, who now owns much cash and
a cowboy-comedian reputation, travelled
round Australia with Wirths’ Circus. He
did an equestrian turn, as well as the rope-
spinning tricks that he still puts into his
pictures. At present he is in Los Angeles
(.U.S.A.). giving Snowy Baker some hints
on spinning the rope in exchange for in-
struction in cracking a stockwhip.
“0. Ockney”: Drama dead? Don’t you
believe it! Not in London, anyway. West
End theatres find what used to be scornfully
denominated “Surrey-side blood-and-thunder”
very acceptable. The Empire, Leicester-
square, for long the most fashionable variety
house, has, to the surprise of the old habitues
of its promenade and lounge-bars, gone over
to the drama. An American play, known at
home as "The Dummy,” but rechristened
"Some Detective,” was at latest advices
being staged there, with Ethel Irving as lead-
ing lady and Stephen Ewart in the cast.
"Film Up”: After all these years of prac-
tice it is surprising that the ’Murkan lady
screen-stars do not make up better. Their
eyes have mostly the appearance of burnt
holes in blankets and the paint on their lips
makes them look jammy-mouthed. “Close-
ups” of such over-stressed beauties are
enough to frighten every movie patron who
is not in his first youth away from the pic-
tures for ever. We see quite enough of that
style of art in the streets nowadays.
“Also Ranter” : Talking of announcements
of changes in the cast, I was with Rignold
at Sydney Majesty’s when an imported star
got so sozzled on the first night that the Old
Man wouldn’t let him coruscate. Rignold's
“pink slip” announced a substitute, “owing
to Mr. Hyphen-Howler having sprained a
sinew in his left leg.”

VICTORIA. DIDO.
A FOND DELUSION.
[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
I’ve read about the ballet girl,
I’ve seen her in the picture plays;
She sometimes yokes up with an earl,
She always has a brace of Jays
Who’re full of money, and agree
On her to lavish heaps of pdf.
It’s all so wonderful to see,
So startling and so strange to me—
And I’m a ballet girl myself.
When my night’s work at length is done
And to my humble home I’ve sped,
I take some milk and p’raps a bun,
And straightway tumble into bed.
No glittering halls do me entice
Where men of millions sup and dance ;
I don’t go much on gilded vice
And, anyhow, to be concise,
I simply do not get the chance.
On Sunday I have got to wash
Apd darn and mend my daily wear,
And listen to a little bosh
From the star boarder on the stair.
But as for whirling round in space
In some Jay’s gaudy car, I vow
It never happens in my case—
A tram-ride to a seaside place
Is my big flutter' up to now.

When Clirysolaus won the Chelmsford
Stakes at the Sydney Tatt.’s meeting last year he
broke a sequence of four wins by young horses. On
Saturday there were 19 runners, eight of them three-
year-olds, and riot one pushed into the first three,
while only one ran respectably. That was “Baron”
Brown’s Duke Foote gelding Duke Isinglass, and even
he took but a feeble part in the argument over the
last two furlongs. The main problem of the event
this year concerned the staying capacity (dr other-
wise) of E. E. D. Clarke’s filly Furious (The Welkin-
Donaide), who was quite the best of her year last
season. Her public performances in the autumn
and her recent track work suggested endurance; her
breeding implied the contrary. She started on
Saturday a warm favorite, With Salitros next in
demand. (Prices, 10 to 1 bar 2 and 100’s to 5
bar ;5.) S'alitrds was not among the leading 10
at the end. Furious, ridden by McLachlan, was
never worse than fourth, but half a mile from home
she commenced to fail. Elfacre was at this stage
well in front, and at the distance seemed to be
master of his neighbor Syce Knight and a sure win-
ner, But Maher called on the Syce horse, who re-
sponded, and Elfacre was collared and beaten a head
in the last 20 yards. David, who had been slow to
get. going, travelled up the straight at a tremendous
bat! finishing a : length away third. The last three
were the three-year-olds Science, Otacre and Dia-
logue. The nine furlongs were traversed in “52.”
This time has only once been beaten in the race —by
Ohrysolaus—and only once before equalled—by
Gloaming, when he won three years ago with 6st.
1011); aboard. This year Gloaming stayed in his box
with quinsy.
There have been times when horses after per-
forming as indifferently as Furious and Pelaw
Main in the Chelmsford have taken a Derby—
Cetigne and Biplane, for instance. But as Furi-
ous showed no sign of stamina the supposition
that she may do better with another stone over
a longer journey calls for tremendous optimism.
Pelaw Main, who looked backward in condition, gave
no sign of either pace or ability to stay. A much
better Derby trial was registered by the Maorilander
Cupidon, trained by Richard Mason. This is a weli-
grpwn Martian gelding. He won the Novice Handi-
cap, a mile, with Bst. 81b. and something to spare
in, “41,” beating a fairly smart lot. Loyal Irish,
another Derby candidate, was given a spin with 7st.
in the Spring Handicap, 10 furlongs, and backed to
win a ton. He was well up for half the distance,
arid then faded out. Ridden better he will do better
in the Derby. On Saturday he looked the best-
trained three-year-old on the premises.
Tattersall’s Tramway Handicap (seven furlongs)
is staged as a dress-rehearsal for the Epsom, and on
Saturday 15 horses weighed out, among them some
Of those best backed for the big mile —Greenstead,
Beauford, Erasmus, Alfort, Wish Wynne, Gambler’s
Gold, Mac Jack, Gilray and Etive. Newcastle went
solidly for Alfort on the allegation that he was more
forward than Beauford. Randwick favored Green-
stead and Gambler’s Gold. It was s’s Alfort, 6’s
Greenstead and B’s Beauford and Gambler’s Gold.
Newcastle picked the wrong-’un. Alfort was first
from the barrier, and was out on his own for three
furlongs. There Wood hustled Beauford up to the
leader, and, running to the front, hit the straight
first. Greenstead tried hard to get to terms with
the leader at the Leger, but was easily held, and
o\er the last half furlong Beauford was running
away from him. Carrying 9st. 81b. like a feather-
weight he again showed Randwick his phenomenal
class. Wish Wynne, who is not nearly so solid-
looking as when she ran second in last Doncaster,
struggled through a demoralised lot into third place.
Gambler’s Gold never got clear of the ruck. Both
Erasmus and Gilray ran inconspicuously. Beau-
ford will shed 61b. of lead for the Epsom. On
Saturday’s run he may be hard to beat.
For the past three years the winner of
Caulfield Cup has predicted himself freely in Mel-
bourne during September, so probably Tangalooma
was a true prophet when he won the Mentone Handi-
cap last Saturday. The event cuts no ice as a test
of the best handicap form, but it proved Tangalooma
to be coming along nicely. The big horse had to be
equal to winning it if he is to he cherry-ripe five
weeks later, and he did the trick in commanding
style. That he gave a lot of weight away to his
immediate followers is not a matter of importance:
Bst. 81b. in next Caulfield Cup will suit him quite
a-; well as the 7st. 91b. he carried into third place,
behind stable-companion liurythmic, last year. What
he links is cleverness in avoiding trouble, and his
Caulfield Cup chance will depend somewhat on the
luck of the start and the size of the field.
* * * *
Gloaming’s racing career will probably
have to be resumed in Maoriland, as it wa« last
season. G. D. Greenwood’s luck with his champion
has been of the worst as regards Tatt.’s meetings.
The hope of Fred Williams’s stable in the Epsom
will probably be Greenstead. Erasmus has been
lame, and although lanre horses often win big events,
Erasmus may not last long enough on that dickey
pin to win the A.J.C. mile.
*,* - * *
The once speedy lownit is responsible for
Monopolist, who just squeezed in front of Repique,
last year’s Guineas winner, in the llfur. Spring
Handicap at Port Adelaide. The faithful Paratoo
was carried off his legs, but staggered with most
money into third place. Colonel Aides, the Guineas
favorite, never got a look-in in that race with Cul-
tana (Pendil—Ooregum), who carved out the 9fur.
40yds. in lrnin. 594seb. The fast Cheltenham track
was again responsible for good time in the Flying
(sfuv.). Crusader, with 9st. 51b., was distinctly out
of place in this race, as one of the lightweights,
Anonda, flew over the distance in lrnin. isec.
■***■*
“15-30”: W. M. Johnston, who found
Shimidssu and Kumagae so easy in the Davis Cup
final, owns the best drive I have ever seen. Weigh-
ing a little over 9st., Johnston is a living refuta-
tion of the delusion that the drive gains in ferocity
according to the amount of meat behind it. Pat-
terson, about our biggest man among first-class play-
ers, and Johnston’s burly countryman Watson Wash-
burn never smacked a ball like the little Californian,
whose hurricane forehand shot is the result of per-
fect timing and body swing, combined with a flick
of the wrist as the racquet curves over the ball to
produce the low trajectory and troublesome spin.
Johnson's drives are fatal to the best of base-liners,
and the only chance a man has of checking his offen-
sive is to i‘ush in and try to get his bullets back
on the volley. I saw two dazzling volleyers, Brookes
and O’Hara Wood, severely punish him and Tilden
in an exhibition doubles last year. The Yankees
faded away in three sets, and the only excuse that
could be made for them is that they are singles
experts who would expect to be comparatively at sea
against probably the
best doubles combina-
tion in the world.
Johnston, who ought
to win the U.S.
singles championship
this time, has suf-
fered the worst of his
few defeats from men
of his own school of
play. At Wimbledon a
couple of years back
he crumpled up be-
fore the veteran J. C.
Parke, the remark-
aide exponent of the
running drive, who
practically won the
Davis Cup for Eng-
land by walloping
Norman Brookes in
1912.
HAWKES, the
young Victorian
tennis champion,
who did so well in
the Davis Cup
games.
Todd, Hawkes and Anderson have won
their first round in the U.S. Singlcc Championship,
Todd dropped two games in three sets against Gros-
beck. Hawkes was too good for : Rosenbaum (6 —2.
6 —3, 6—3), but Anderson’s inaccuracies lost him
the first set l to Rice (1 —6) before he pulled himself
together and got home easily with 6—2, 6—4, 6—3
in his favor. Peach, up against Hugrahm, a little-
known player from Boston, failed dismally (3 —6,
I—6, 4—6).
Sydney I. has won the Badge (tennis)
matches for the fifth year in succession. For once
Horace Rice was below form and played as badly in
the doubles as he had in the singles a week earlier
against Neil. He and Thomas dropped their first
rubbers in the reason, losing to both Neil-Plomley
and March-F. Peach. On form Neil should go close
to winning the Sydney Club’s captaincy, and also the
Metropolitan championships at Strathfield, to com-
mence at the end of the month. Rice and R. Thomas
should annex the doubles championship.
In Melbourne on Saturday night Jamito,
the Manilaman, turned the tables on Bert McCarthy,
who was adjudged the winner over him a while back.
On this occasion Jammy was clearly the better man,
and at times in the last five rounds —it went the full
20—he had the paleface tottering. But as each
man understood the other s methods, and both
overdid the holding-and-hitting business, it was a
monotonous scrap.
The Irish-American Jimmy Clabby had
not been knocked out for 14 years until last Satur-
day night, when the painful experience befel him
at Sydney Stadium. The destroying agents were
Frank Burns, of Newcastle, aiid Am o Domini ; and
of the two the latter’s work was the deadlier. The
N. S. Wales lad would have presented few difficulties
to the Clabby of the past—-the artist who was good
enough to. stop Dave Smith in a round, win front
McGoortv and go 20 rounds with Les Darcy. But
on Saturday, while Clabby had all his old skill
and ringcraft and all his wonderful pluck, he lacked
the power of old ; and after the half-way mark had
been passed lie was no longer able to hide the fact.
Dropped with a right cross in the 15th round, lie
staggered up at “nine,” helpless hut resolute. Burns
punched him to the
boards again with
hammer-like lefts and
rights. When the
veteran rose for the
third time he was
only capable of stand-
ing and making a
half-instinctive effort
to cover up. As
Burns sent him down
once m ore the
slaughter was stopped,
and it is a pity the
step was not taken
earner. Burns is a
useful performer who
should go a long way
as a middle before he
is Clabby’s age.

Some IS,OOO Leagueites filled Sydney
Sports Ground last Saturday while South Sydney
walloped Eastern Suburbs by 21 points (5 tries 3
goal") to. 10 points (2 tries 2 goals) in the City
Cup final. The Surfers, minus Ives, began by notch-
ing 10 points (tries by Steele and Holmes with 2
goals by Oxford) to the Rabbitos’ nil. The red
and green XIII were sluggish. In the second spasm,
however, the Rabbitos, backed by the wind and the
curses of their supporters, beat the Surfers in every
serum. Inside a minute O’Connor, their big appren-
tice rucker, had battled across the chalk line, and
Holder had raised both flags, Then Border got the
ball on the wing, and booted it to V. Lawrence, who
scored under the bar. Holder missed. J. Lawrence
capped a fine effort by Funnel!, and this time Horder
goaled. South, 13; East, 10; and Bedlam was
loose. Horder scored neatly from a penalty ; V.
Lawrence cleared out and sent Funnell across, and
he was presently followed by O’Connor. At times
it was absolutely monotonous. The proceeds will be
divided among the League Assurance Fund, various
hospitals and four League pioneers—H. Flegg (selec-
tor), H. Hallett and W. Niell (international rep. and
custodian) and 11. Kelley.
In the N.S.W. Soccer championship at
Wentworth Park (Sydney) on Saturday Pyrmont
earned the right to play Granville in the semi-final
by defeating Corrimal, 4 to 1. Pyrmont attacked,
and after some good work by McLean and Osborne,
Pyrmorit’s wing men, Maitland netted. Johnston
and Loveridge followed suit. In the second session
Osborne scored again for Pyrmont before -V. William-
son shot one for the South Coast combination. It
was a dull game.

North Island (M.L.) papers have been
howling at the N.S.W. Rugby footballers for rough
play in the Wellington match, wherein they met
their only defeat. The S’Africans started this yarn
by way of explaining to the Rieketty Islanders their
inability to walk right over the N. S. Welshmen. A
recent Cape Times contains a letter from the Spring-
boks’ special correspondent in which he goes inco
full details of the alleged infamous conduct of the
Cornstalks, even opining that those who entertained
S’Afrieans in Sydney did so with a sinister motive.
M.L. has sent some rough diamonds to Australia —
Hardcastle and Asher, for instance —but a howl was
not set up at their methods. It was taken as all in
the game. Roberts, the Wellington idol, over whom
most of the fuss is being made on this occasion, is
a very slippery half who also shines as ;a five-eighth.
He is noted for his anticipation, which ip where he
probablv fell foul of the visitors. They- would act
on the principle that nothing breaks up combination
worse than collaring a man before he gets the ball.
N. S. Wales Rugby Union team caught
the blast at Wellington (M.L.) in the final match
of the tour last week, ajid crashed by 16 points
to 8. In 10 matches it was the only defeat—the
best record of a N.S.W. Rugby army that has vet
invaded M.L. In aggregate they piled up 229 points
against 91. N. Mingav (Manly) was the biggest
scorer, and kicked 18 goals from 23 tries. He
topped with 48 points; and D. B. London (30),
“Slip” Carr (28) and J. Pym (25) did their share.
The team, which got back to Sydney this week, will
be kept in condition for a final clash with the
S'pringboks at Sydney on September 24.
The Springboks defeated a combined XV
from Nelson, Marlborough and Golden Bay at Nelson
on Saturday by 26 —3. The locals made it as merrv
as the ’Boks wished in the first half, and the scores
show 3 all; but the machine-like play of the
tourists after refreshment outclassed the -opposition,
and they rattled up 23 to nil. De Kock scored two
of the six tries, and G. Morkel’s safe boot kicked
four goals. The combined team’s score was a
penalty kick by Fitzgerald.
>\ortli Sydney defeated Newtown in the
Australian Rules premiership final on Saturdav The
winners took the lead from the bounce, and" were
ahead 26—9 at the first quarter. Newtown improved
in the second term, and the score stood 33 —27 at
the bell. In the third, which was bitter and rougt
Norths scored 26 to Newtown’s 6. The doomed <■
made a strenuous effort in the last term, but Norths’
were well out when the bell clanged with the score-
-68 to 54. Simmons (three goals) and Glow,
played a great game for Newtown. Fitzmauriee,
Cohen, Charge and King were Norths’ best. It wa-
Norths’ third win, the previous successes being iu
1904 and 1909. Newtown won in 1906, and h--
been six times runner-up.

Though none of Saturday’s games had any
effect on the destination of the League pennant.
Vic.'s football supporters parted no less than
£ll5O to view them. They might, in the circum-
stances, have been courteous and scientific exhibi-
tions: in fact they were unusually willing, and cheer-
ful little mills enlivened the proceedings on two
of the grounds. Carlton kept their place with
ease, disposing of Melbourne by 100 points to Tii.
Geelong (at home, of course) smothered South with
66 points to 28. Essendon seized their last chain.
to get off the bottom rung of the ladder and man-
aged to draw with 'Roy, thus pushing St. Kilda into
the position of whipper-in. Richmond thumped
the aforesaid Saints by 95 points to 47.
By losing to Thornton’s XI after their
defeat by the amateurs, Armstrong’s men drew with
the record of .Toe Darling’s imperishable 1902 com-
bination. The defeats of the present team wen
narrow ones (by 28 and 33 runs respectively), an
the tourists should certainly have drawn the Scar
borough game if not won it. However, they h.i
the best of luck—in perfect weather, resulting;
in pitches that suited their style, and in an almo-t
complete absence of casualties —and there is no
doubt about the poor class of English cricket tem-
porarily. Darling's lot encountered a typical oil
English summer, a clinking good All-England side
and some remarkably strong counties and yet man-
aged to beat the lot. The team which is bringing
back the ashes is a solid, level affair, that kept tit,
tried hard and was well handled throughout, out it
hardly compares with some of the classic Australian
teams of the past. Macartney is not a Trumper nor
Bardsley a Duff, and the bowling has been made
to look a lot better than it is by the feebleness oi
the English batting, pins the ill-health of Jack
Hobbs and llearne. It is as superlative fieldsmen
that the 1921 victors will go down in the crick"t
history of all time. Exclude Armstrong ami
Mayne (who didn’t often play), and there is not a
man but deserves in the neighborhood of 95 mark-
for the season’s work in this department.

If the hurdles hadn’t been in the way 11.
L. Sheaves, the Ma State crack, would have carried
off the Australian cross-country championship at
Caulfield on Saturday. Kohlman, the tall Victorian,
was decidedly superior over the jumps, and tlm
superiority enabled him to gain the title.
But •it was a grand race. Sheaves took the 1-,
early and set a severe pace—too severe for mo-t of
his 36 opponents, representing five States. Kohl-
man trailed him grimly, with Page (Vic.) third
and Porter (N.S.W.), Paveell (Q.) and Grande-
mange (N.S.W.) in that order. At every jumi
Kohlman gained on the spare Cornstalk, and in
the last lap lie ran up level. But Sheaves struggled
on valiantly, beat the Victorian champion for pace
between the obstacles and raced towards the' final
jump a yard ahead. It was his last lead. Sheaves
scrambled over the hurdle clumsily; Kohlman flew
it like a bird. Making the most of his advantage,
the gallant Victorian went on to win by eight yards
(llsec.) in 58nriii. 36see., a record for the course.
Page (69min. 4seri.) was third. Porter (59min. 25sec )
fourth, Grandemfpge (69min. 53sec.) fifth, and
Par-cell (59min. 59sec.) sixth. Fitzsimmons, the
N. S. Wales captain, was seventh man, and McKenzie,
another' Cornstalk, eighth. Thus the Ma State won
the teams' race easily with a score ,of .35 points,
Victoria being second with 52 points and Queensland
third with 118 points.

A. W. Winter tackled his own hop, step
and jump record of 48ft. 24in. at Hampden Oval
(Sydney) on Saturday, and got within the odd inehe-
of the figures. In the pole vault he surmounted
10ft., and then threw the cricket hall 107yds. Ift.
A doubtful ankle threatens his chances in the com-
ing championships.
* * * *
The 10-ntile cross-country championship
of S.A. was run on the usual course. It is doubtful
if any other city anywhere could accommodate an
event of the kind in the heart of itself, so to speak.
The runners start, at the Oval, go up river past the
University Oval to the Zoo, back again and over a
shoulder of Montefidre Hill, and come into the lime-
light by finishing at the Oval pavilion in the half-
time interval of a football match. Rumsby, this
year’s winner, came home alone in 61min. 16sec..
which time is 21sec. better than that of Collins
(Vic.) last year. Graham, the five-mile champion,
way second. Both are Adelaide Harriers, and that
club won the teams’ race.
* \ * * *
Fifty-seven started in the revived N.S.W.
Cyclists’ Union Goulburn-Sydney 131-mile road race
on Saturday. The road was damaged by rain over
the early stages. H. Paulston (Enfield), who is only
18 and had never previously won an open-road race,
crossed the line first in 7hr. Omin. 7sec. He was
on the 26min.-mark, and won with llmin. 45see.
to spare from veteran G. Walcott. M. G. Clarke
(Vie.) did well to finish fourth in 7hr. lOmin. ssec.
Mick Little (scratch), the State champion, did fast-
est time (6hr. 56min. 40sec.). Paulston averaged
184 m.p.h.
G. L. Waleote, who ran second to the 18-
vear-old Paulton in the Goulburn-to-Sydnev cycling
road-race, is a proof of the fact that age will **
served sometimes. Jn 1909 he was second in the
Picton-to-Ashfield race, and in 1912 he scored
fastest time in the same event. He gave up
bicycling and went into his latest contest with
practically no training.
The boom in Sydney cricket is such that
Moore Park is taking its week-end teams in relays
The mvriad clubs are being divided into two lots-
the morning and the afternoon performers. The
fact that this arrangement can be worked out sfkrt 5
the growth of the Saturday morning loaf.
THE BIRD OF SPRING.
[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
Lo, Spring has come! The bloke who knows
Is full of information
Concerning how each Cup 'orse goes;
And, oh, his conversation
Is tinted like the damask rose
That on a brunette’s bosom glows—
The soft wind blushes when it blows
His ruddy exclamation.
Gay petals from his perfumed word.
Of touts characteristic,
Fly all around. The things he’s heard-
The griffins, straight or mystic!
I would I knew one-half, one-third,
As much as he, the Early Bird,
Who never thinks ho is absurd,
And looks so fierce and fistic.
He knows about a Derby colt,
Wot Billy wos astride on
The day the blanker did a bolt
(This tip can be relied on),
Which colt, as Billy said to ’Olt '
(O, Bird with scarce a plume to moult,
Compared with thee I’m but a dolt!)
Is faster than Poseidon.
He knows a filly that can go
As quick as time is fleeting—
Ay, quicker than the driven snow
Before tornado sleeting ;
She makes a flash of light look slow.
Last year her crowd was lying low ;
But when the money torks, yer know,
,She’ll take a world of beating.
His thanks, when I increase his debts,
Are sanguinely effusive;
No 'orse’s form the Bird forgets
That’s fitful and illusive; .
He urges me to reckless bets;
1 back the cert, which fate upsets,
And drown in silence my regrets.
His comments are abusive.
Sweet Early Birds of fragrant Spring,
Who stable secrets mutter
Whilst toiling round on crippled wing
To earn your bread and butter,
A dream of joy to me you bring,
A song of golden hope you sing;
I’d pension you. if I were King,
And save you from the gutter.
VICTORIA.

ANOTHER
CITROEN RECORD.
Wins Highest Average Mileage in
Actual Petrol Consumption Test, in
the Brisbane to Sydney Contest, with
a Record of 44.16 Miles to the Gallon
throughout the entire 817 miles.
In the N.S.W. Royal Automobile
Club’s Five-Day Touring Contest
from Brisbane to Sydney, the Citroen
Car averaged the remarkable figure
of 44.1 6 miles to the gallon of petrol
over 81 7 i miles that included sand,
mud, bogs, scarcely-formed roads,
steep hills and rough mountain coun-
try. Yet the Citroen Car not only
achieved this average for this entire
distance, but finished each day of the
test well ahead of the time limit. The
highest mileage per gallon achieved
on any one day was 17 7 miles to 3
gallons, or 39 miles average to the
gallon. This is unbeatable for a
standard chassis.

Dame Nellie appeared at her second tri-
umphal concert in a sheath of silver tissue
over which was hung filmy white georgette
—sdmewhat like the snow mantle of
armored warriors of old. (By the way,
didn't our Diggers imitate the snow-mantle
of the ancients in an emergency by covering
their khaki with Parisian nightiesV) She
was bejewelled with great magnificence. A
girdle of diamonds at her waist, diamonds
on the corsage and diamond leaves handing
her smooth hair; a rope of pearls; a chain
of rubies with a tassel of pearls tipped with
rubies; rubies in her ears, and diamonds and
rubies on her lingers and—well, you couldn't
see her toes because they were in silver
slioon. The hall was packed, of course. Sas-
siety glinted and dazzled, hut .Mrs. George
of the Chirnsides wore the most eye-catching
glad rags of them all. The Governor and his
Countess were there, the Countess in black
chiffon velvet with a red-ribbon snood. Lord
and Lady Digby sat in the front row —he
has just been attached as military private
sec. to Lord Forster. The Fannings and the
Baillieus, the Paynes and the Edward and
Albert Miller dames, the Tucketts and the
Xtaughtons were-also present.
Thus far the Civic Ball holds the record
for the year. The decorations were a
shriek in yellow flowers and colored electric
lights, which wandered together up the lat-
tice-work that camouflaged the pillars, then
clambered over the ceiling and came down
again. The magic of scene-painter Cole-
man hid the awfulness of the organ platform
and stage with a gorgeous Oriental picture
that backed the low dais on which Gaud
Mayor and Mayoress Swanson—the latter in
black and gold—howdydo’d the thousand and
a half guests before the two vice-regal
groups filed in. Lady Forster was a dream
in trained gold tissue and jade-green ebif-
fonery, with a Limerick lace scarf round her
shoulders. Countess Stradbroke, more Du
Maurierish than ever, walked in elaborate
dressings of peacock-blue satin, with bead
trimmings and a snaky tail of stamped vel-
vet and beads. Lady' Helena Rous, looking
more cheery than usual, sported mauve
georgette and no gloves. She and the Swan-
son daughter (all in white) whirled in the
opening Lancers, thereby robbing that first
act of some of its official stiffness. The
Irvines, Littleton Grooms and Arthur Robin-
sons, John Monash and naval-man Hardy
also lancered. After this the Stradbroke pair
once or twice took the floor together, and
with other members of the official party, but
the intricacies of some of the new dances led
their feet astray. They seemed to enjoy
their mistakes most of all-
In an upstairs room—‘admittance by ticket
only—men and women fought in clouds of
tobacco smoke for oysters and stout, and
there were cream-puffs, ice-creams and coffee
in two supper chambers. The official party
fed in select seclusion, and the oldest guests
recalled that glorious past when the crowd
as well as the officials ate hot turkey and
green peas at mayoral balls. On the other
hand, everyone sang a Te Deum over the
blue-pencilling of the d6butante-set absur-
dity.
The Stradbrokes are bent upon swatting
up Australia from every angle. When not
studying mayors, politicians, baby-clinics
and bazaar-promoters they turn to our vege-
table curiosities. They sat at the feet, of
A. J. Campbell the other evening while he
talked on the wattle under the banner of the
Town Planning Assoc, at the Town Ilall.
Governor Stradbroke paid a visit to the
Royal Park Children’s Home last week, and
made a few score more friends. Melbourne
likes him better- every month.
Gaud Mayor. Swanson’s bliss at the pros-
pect of reigning over Melbourne for another
12 months is cooled by the fact that it is
his turn to face the ratepayers of-. Ijourke
Ward soon after the mayoral election.
Bonrke Ward has been, gradually ciiddlin'g
up closer to Labor, and, it. is expected that
Swanson will have a stiff fight, this time to
get his neck back into the ’alter of hoftis.
Last year Cr. Treadwell managed it by only

Northediffo, who descended upon us early

TJie Vic. district of the A.J.A. will muster at

spects to the Thunderer.
Apostolic Delegate Cattaneo came over
from Sydney to preside at a Town Hall cele-
bration of th(> sextenary of Dante’s death

The Henry Parker knight, one-time Chief
Justice of Westralia, has carried out. a long-
deferred threat of leaving his big grey home
in the West to put himself out to grass iu
Melbourne. With three daughters he is shel-
tering in a South Yarra paying-guestery until
the roomy house he has acquired on the
Domain-road is fixed up. One of his four
unattached chicks, who uses her voice with
rather more than amateur skill, is making a
few months’ investigation of the Anglo-
Indian social whirl.
Artist Cyril Dillon was commanded—up to
Coombe Cottage a few days ago to do some
etchings round about the homestead. Melba

Dr. 11. 11. Fetherston, P’ran's new
Assembly member, was Director-General of
Medical Services during the war, and before
that he was a military surgeon with a vast
private practice in his electorate. Fether-
ston succeeded to the patients of his late
dad, a gruff and practical medico of the old
school, "and, being energetic and progressive,
soon found it necessary to take iu a partner,
who, on Fetherston’s departure to Oollins-
street, also engaged another man to share
his fees. The new M.P.. whose main plank
in.the Assembly will be Health Reform, is a
clever gynaecologist, known to many hospital
staffs as Bertie.
David Low’s pretty sister Dorothy hasn’t
seen much of the* summer sunshine in Lon-
don this year. Illness after illness has be-
fallen her, and at latest scarlet fever had
quarantined the little lady.
Father Michael Watson, S.J., of St. Pat’s
College, had the golden jubilee of liis priest-
hood on September 10. Born in the Ould
Sod in ’45, lie entered Maynooth in ’(l2, and
became a full-blown priest at Liege (Bel-
gium) in ’7l. He descended upon Melbourne
in ’72, and from ‘B7 till 1918 was editor of
the Messenger. In the ’eighties, when he
was minister and household controller at
Xavier College, the boys nicknamed him
“Guinea.” Handicapped by deafness he set
himself to keep step with the most energetic
of his Order, and, as a result, he addressed,
in limpid prose and graceful verse, larger
congregations than any other of his Order in
Australia.
Commander Haggard has taken over the
job of private sec. to our Earl, and Neil
Smith is retiring.
Playwright Louis Esson’s homecoming in
the Demosthenes with his wife, formerly Dr.
Hilda Bull, was a surprise to relatives on
this siue. The first intimation to most of
them was a wire from Fremantle, “Have
arrived in Aussie,” or words to that effect.
Almost up to the moment of their sailing
Dr. Hilda was lip to the neck in her work
of putting the stethoscope over young women
who sought to come to Australia at Govern-
ment expense. ■
Ethel A. Bishop, pictured here by lier old
pal Jessie Mackintosh, of Hawthorn, is the
youngest painter-lady to capture the
National Gallery Scholarship. It was won
in I!U4, but the war
postponed that trip
to Europe which the
scholarship provides.
Eventually she got
away in 1919, and
spent a happy time
copying Old Masters,
sketching in Wales
and feasting on the
incomparable collec-
tion, of Raeburns in
Scottish galleries.
Home again, she .set-
tled down to hard
work, and promises
to appear with Adel-
aide Perry and H.
M. Paterson in a
joint exhibition at
the Athenaeum next
week. . The young painter made a youthful
debut itVt Adelaide as the winner of the Lon-
don Society of Art medal and the bronze star
of th?> Royal Drawing Society of London.
James and Will Ashton were her mentors in
those days.
Naval-instructor Charles Franklin and the
Monty Langdon widow’s youngest daughter
Marjorie are being liberally congratulated
on their joint matrimonial intentions. The
keen young folk of Jervis Bay College tried
unsuccessfully to look surprised at the un-
veiling of the noisy secret, which they jolly
well guessed, don’t y’ know, long before the
bride-elect finished her visit to the College,
where he and she got acquainted for the
very first time.
Alderman Jeffries and his handsome wife
were the proudest pair at the mayoral jazz,

Fna Bourne, who looks at you from the
adjoining photo by Alice M ills, is one of the
great pianists of her sex, and she has a pile of
press cuttings to prove it. Born at Mudgee
she came over the

as an infant, and
was only five when
her extemporisings
on tin- piano gave,
broad hints of her
startling talent. Site
reached England for
the lirst time in 11)12.
and the high place
she has ever since
held in critical esti-
mation has well
justified Melba's long
interest i n h e r

toured with the diva
several times, and
has been asked to
Buckingham Palace
to tickle the royal ears with some of her
own composition.”.
Paris Nesbit, Adelaide’s K.C., is in Mel-
bourne. He motored up to Coombe Cottage
to take tea with Melba, and has been lunch-

George Benson is an example to Ihe lest of In-
artistic brethren in limiting his show at the
Decoration Gallery to 26 of his best studies in oil
and water-color. The result is that there is very
little to cavil at, and often there is much to
admire, especially in Ids views of old-time gallants
and sweet, drooping ladies, depicted in “The
Balcony” and “Blind Man’s Buff.” In “Gossips”
he gets a delightful effect without mannerism or
overpainting, and is equally fetching in “Summer
Dawn,” where ids discovery of a beautiful nymph
at her bath has driven him to express his grati-
tude in a radiant background of pink and gold.

trunks emerging from their wrappings of mist.
A little gossip from Adelaide: —'
The first sliivoo in aid of the Children's Hospital
was the Carnival of Flowers at the I'a I a is. Louise
Larsson and Robert Jackson laid charge of the decora-
tions, which represented cherry-blossom-time in
Japan. The younger blasC- set wore evening dress,
but the less sophisticated married folk burst into
fancy costume. Her Ex. and other social lights
favored hair poudre. The Mayoress was disguised
as a hotiri, and a smart society woman sacrificed
personal charm to make a realistic Burmese. Amaz-
ing business was done in balloons, paper caps and
flowers. ’Varsity lads came along in boudoir caps
and pyjamas and tore the air with jagged note for
two or three dances. The Rotorua Maoris dropped
in after their show at the Royal. And Louisi
Larsson and her pupil Maxine Tolley danced cleverly.
Mrs. Hedley Todd, who has been paying a visit to
relatives, handed out tea to a number of friends at
the Queen Adelaide Club before she heaved her catiin
trunk aboard the Fog-bound Naldera.
George Aldridge, eldest son of J. H. Aldridge,
Richmond Park, has become a Benedick. Gladys
Lennox Sheirlaxv, daughter of the Lennox Shcirlaw-
of Toorak, is the damsel. The vows were marie in
St. Peter’s College Chapel, and there were rliam-
pagne and speeches afterwards at the S.A. Hotel.
The honeymoon is shining in the eastern States.
At the Flinders-street Presbyterian Church the
other day Education Minister McCoy handed over
daughter Dorothy to the safekeeping of Guy de J.i
Poer Beresford, and a reception and dance at the
Grand Central followed. The pair are such enthusi-
astic jazzers that it was quite appropriate they should
fox-trot over the threshold of married life. In the
matter of wedding gifts it is believed they put up a
S. Aus. record?
Ovpen’s puzzle piotiire, “Sowing New Seed." which
the S.A. Art Gallery returned with thanks, is now
being shown in London at an exhibition of British
art, and Adelaide is scratching its head at the news.
After filling the position of steward on small
steamers as a much-respected young man for 15 years,
one Miss Bailey had to disclose her sex on beim;
taken to hospital with acute rheumatism a few
days ago. She says that, having to provide for her-
self at an early age, she saw greater possibilities a-
a man, and not a soul at her boarding-house at Port
Adelaide had ever suspected her 15-year deception.
The S.A. Orchestra gave its fourth concert —an
admirable one —to a house yawning with empty
spaces. Unfortunately it hit the same night as a
big bridge party at the Grand Central Hotel in aid
of Children’s Hospital; also Dorothea Spinney’s open-
ing recital at the Lister Hall. Which suggests bad
'management somewhere or a wild over-estimate of
Adelaide’s anxiety to hear musical noises.
William T. Scott, a well-known Union Bank offi-
cial, passed out suddenly last week, just, after get
ting home from the day’s work. He had managed
t different country branches, but for the pa"t 16 year-
was in the Adelaide office. In other days he was a
prominent athlete.
When King George was here at the beginning of
the century, he laid the foundation-stone of a Uni.
extension, and on its completion the chief lecture-
room in it was named “Prince of Wales Theatre.”
Last year Adelaide Tivoli, with less reason, changed
its name to P. of W. Theatre, and now there’s such
confusion that the Uni. people will probably turn
their “theatre” into a “bull.”
The small show of Blamire Young’s paintings now
at F. IV. Proeee’s gallery adds nothing to his
reputation. Adelaide long .thought of this artist as
a kind of glorified scene-painter, through having in
(lie Art Gallesy his “Chaucer” and “Old Musician,
both large works getting effects in a broad way.
His one-man show here before the war quite re-
moved that impression, and bis “Smoky End of
Melbourne” was added to the State collection. Th 1
present little lot causes one to waver. Half of then;
have an unfinished look. The “Velasquez” resemble-
a burlesque of Aubrey Beardsley, and the figures ii
a “Classic Landscape” owe nothing to anatomy. Tin
true landscapes, especially a large Mountain with
Castle, and a 'smaller Brown Hill, are far mor<
satisfying.

A WOMAN'S
LETTER
Holeproof
Hostery
At the Society of Artists’ First Day the
Education Gallery was bursting with intel-
.lect, artistic and merely human. Attention
in the first room was about equally divided
for part of the afternoon between Lambert’s
important People” and the important lady
in a ’tween-decks skirt-length of henna with
a Paisley-pattern tunic of the same tone
embroidered in orange. A bird-of-paradise
had paused in full flight to perch on the tiny
island of nigger-brown millinery the lady
wore on her dark tresses. This golden-
shod visitor resolved herself into the newly-
returned Lady Headley. Uruner, in a nut-
brown suit and very sleek hair, tried not to
look consciously prosperous in spite of a
Gallery commission and a Northelifte pur-
chase. Arthur Allen played guardian angel
to Lambert—somebody told him that lii.s pic-
ture looked like Arnold Bennett read, and
he was touched almost to tears. Lionel
Lindsay walked pretending he knew nothing
of the deadly feuds between would-be pur-
chasers of his etchings and the man who had
got in ahead of them. Mr. Holman brought
his Portia in a beribboned hat; Julian Ash-
ton held court, and it was pretty to see all
the younger art-girls fluttering up to him in
little groups*; new president Sydney Ure
Smith was all things to all men, and openly
lamented the absence of wattle-trees from
the walls (“Northclift'e would have bought a
whole acre of bush if we’d had it”). Artist
Minns strode unruffled through the throng,
Bertram Stevens looked like a Spring lamb
thinking how bitter is Death, graceful Miss
Mahony (from May Moore’s studio) gazed
hard at celebrities with a sort of camera
glance, and one of Julian Ashton’s students
had. dressed herself close to the Italian
period of the “Merchant of Venice” days
with just enough recognition of modern
styles to ensure the picturesque without
being odd. Mrs. liix Nicholas was spring-
like in voile, and comedian W. S. Percy was
another celebrity. Lambert’s portrait of
Baldwin Spencer smiled in the most lifelike
fashion on all, and Maine Tempest failing to
materialise by 5 o’clock, Gayfield Shaw
switched off the electrics as a gentle hint.
Northcliffe, incidentally, ’ has promised
Sydney Ure Smith that if Australian artists
can arrange a show in London he will help
it and push it in every way he can.
From the oldest to the newest member
the Institute of Journalists went to the
lunch to Northcliffe; and in preparation for
the words of wisdom that would fall from
the Great Man’s lips, the squares of glass
between the smoke-room and the balcony
at Farmer’s had been removed, so that the
overflow from the main tables might not
miss a syllable of the speech. The guest
arrived breathless and 20 minutes late, wear-
ing horn-rimmed glasses and a tie that held
more red in it than any other color. The
top table—-at which Hugh D. Mclntosh was
one of the decorations —having a better ser-
vice than the others, healths were being pro-
posed before the balcony overflow had cooed
to its crumbled cutlet, and only a vacuum-
cleaner could have disposed of the apple-pie
before Northcliffe was talking about the
printer and the Pacific. Dr. Ward did most
of the speech-making for the Institute, linking
Wentworth and the freedom of the press and
a “hundred years ago” with a magic that
caught the ear and fired the imagination.
After eight years Clara Butt is, if any-
thing, still more Boadicean, holding the great
voice in leash through three-quarters of her
programme, giving it a run in numbers like
“Land of Hope and Glory” till the listener
in the Town Hall feels that the only fitting
accompaniment would be a machine-gun bat-
tery or a Zeppelin raid. The voice has more
terraces than ever, and all the terraces and
the sunken gardens are linked up by orna-
mental steps. For her first appearance she
clothed her six-foot-odd in white satin cov-
ered in jewelled net made quite long, and
with a sweeping train. To a small
woman looking up it might have seemed that
she suddenly visioned the stars, but that
was only the diamond bandeau confining the
singer’s tresses. A bumper house gave a
welcome that sounded like the surf breaking
on Bondi Beach, and the enthusiasm might
have been a typhoon in the China Sea when
she sang her little group of baby songs.
And there was the “Annie Laurie” encore
when one saw the little group of mercenaries
crouched behind the sand dunes of Dunkirk,
and heard the young Scot singing charms
of his beloved, and sighed to think of his
heartache when he found his Annie was as
false as fair. But the glory of It was shat-
tered by the cheap sentiment of “The Keys
of rieuveu, ' husuunu aim Uiie compiactu,..y
pouring out the verses that sound like a
list 'of pawnbroker’s pledges while the house
rocked with approval. Both Lady Forster
and Dame Margaret sat in the front pews;
and Strella Wilson and Ralph Errolle sat
together and noted with interest the things
that make for wedded material and artistic
success. v
Gladys Moncrieff had municipal honors
thrust upon her one morning last week when
Mayoress Lambert called Sydney to do honor
to the jmuug Queenslander in the reception-
rooms of the Town. Hall. Gladys, who brought
mother with her, was. very girlish in a fawn
costume and a black picture hat, and hugged
a bit of the bush—waratabs and native roses
—that the Actors’ Association had given her.
Social, theatrical and political Sydney looked
in to say good morning. Mrs. Storey came
to the party; Mrs. Frederick Ward and Mrs.
Marlow kept each other company, and Mrs.
Verbrugghen and Mrs. Bertie Kelly and Mrs.
Hugh Ward clapped approval of the soft com-
pliments poured out by Mr. Layton as the
Mayoress’s mouthpiece. The idea at the back
of it all is that in the rush to do honor to
imported artists our own Australians have
been too often forgotten. Starting with
Gladys, native-grown talent is Jto get its
share of the civic cakes and ale. Will the
reform run to the girl who wins the prize
for the best scones at the Show? It should.
There isn’t so much in picking out and enter-
taining the girl whose triumphs are loudly
advertised. The great thing is to lift un-
known worth into the limelight.
Even by motor it’s a long and dusty ride
out to Tresillian, the new training-school for
mothers, but if you go by the tram it is
longer and dustier, and you see the hot and
arid and hungry little streets that are gradu-
ally pushing out the spacious old homes of
which Tresillian is representative. Besides
its garden Tresillian owns a cedar staircase
and some good panelling, so there’s food for
the eyes of the tired and ailing little mothers
who will be gathered there. Dr. Truby
King’s methods of caring for baby have been
installed, and the home and training-school
was declared open last week by Dame Mar-
garet, who, making a wary tally of the
doctors at the party, and finding her own
not present, made quite a long speech. A
handsome blue cloak rich in gold embroideries
didn’t altogether draw intention from the
fact that her Ex. is still bearing traces of
her attack of tonsilitis. Her Ex., hy the
way, intends to spend a Queensland holiday
at Beaudesert, Mrs. Willie Collins’s home.
Among the weddings booked for next
month is that of Dr. Wallace, of the Callan
Park staff, who is marrying a daughter
of barrister Ralston, K.C., of Strathfield—
which makes her a grand-daughter of that
Judge Windeyer who wae the most-discussed
man on the Supreme Court Bench in his day.
Carrie Nash, whose dad is Dr. John Brady
Nash, of Macquarie-street and an M.L.C.,
became Mrs. Bruce McLachlan at St.
Mary’s the other evening. She wore the
usual satin and lace trappings, quite a fea-
ture of her finery being a beautiful old lace
veil lent by Mrs. Phipps. Sister Jo was the
one bridesmaid and wore a lilac taffeta frock
in conjunction with a n ; nk carnation and
lilac orchid bouquet. Ivatoomba saw the
honeymoon. Bridegroom, who wore two
pips at the end of the war,' belongs to the
family which gave the Commonwealth its
first Public Service Commissioner and flic
N.S.W Railways a Secretary; and when
not marrying or soldiering, Bruce helps Dal-
gety’s keep count of their beeves and fatlings.
This is a May Moore picture of Jean
Curlewis, who has just had her first book
accepted by Ward,
Lock and Co., the
publishers who
brought out mother’s
first offering, “Seven
Little Australians,”
as far back as 1894.
Jean, who was a
Church of England
Grammar girl, has
been trying her pen
ever since she was
in short frocks, and
in addition to the
usual essays i n
prose she has
already produced a
good deal of charm-
ing verse. “The
Ship that Never Set
Sail” is the title of
the first long-story
venture.
Tom Anderson, of the Halberg-'Parsons
firm of auditors of the Equitable Buildings,
joined the ranks of the Benedicks last mouth
at St. Carthage’s Cathedral, Lismore. Sweet
Annie McDermott, daughter of pio»-
eers of Lismore, was the bride. Her drapings
were tulle ornamented with Brussels lace and
a froth of silver. After the usual toasts and
jingling of champagne glasses at the home of
the bride, Cupid escorted the pair across the
border to Southport. Strathfield provides
the permanent nesting place.
The round-the-world and aeross-the-earth
Mi's. Charlotte Cameron is enjoying her
cruise among the South Sea islands. At
Suva she chased no South Sea bubble, but
caught some whale-teeth necklaces and
breastplates, with which the last cannibal
chiefs loved to adorn themselves. At Tonga
she called on the Queen. Sydney will see
her again in December. A suggested title
for her new book is “Charlotte Cameron Sees
South Seas,” and that should be as popular
with posterity as, our old friend “Peter
Piper.”
Slim Myrtle Thorne, whose contralto notes
flowed through the Town Hall last year like
honey and balm of Gilead when she gave her
first recital, is looking toward London and n
niche among the stars. To this end a large
and important committee is arranging a con-
cert for the 2.lth of next month. The un-
tiring Mrs. Tretie, Mrs. Matthews of the
South Sydney Hospital, Mrs. John Stinson
and Premier John Storey’s wife are part of
the energetic committee. Myrtle, who is
said to possess a collection of Clara Butt’s
notes, sang for the big contralto during the
week.
It was pneumonia that last week called
away Enid Karin Dowdell, the young wife
of the manager of the Orient Co. Mrs.
I fowdell, who was married only 10 months
ago, was a well-known Melbourne girl. The
illness lasted but throe days. .
After an absence of seven years (three
and a half in the war-zone) Cecil Bertram
Darley, has returned to Sydney with a wife,
lie is the younger son of the late Chief
Justice (the elder sou, Sylvester, died a
couple of years ago). Another visitor is
Mrs. Erie Darley, formerly Edith Holdship.
who married one of tin' sailor sons of Cecil
Darley, brother of the late Chief Justice, and
one time an engineer in the N.S.W. Civil
Service.
Chicago, once associated with pork-packing
and Dibbs’s Damn, is now a stronghold of
opera, and grimy Pittsburg has become one of
the world’s art centres. At the twentieth
international exhibition held at the Carillgie
Institute, Pittsnurg, this year, Lambert,
Streeton, Coates and Hayley Lever are re-
presented in an international collection.
Mary Bridge, the winsome elder daughter
of the Lionel Bridges, has given her promise
to Jack Flynn, Dr. Flynn’s second son.
■ New general-manager Lines of the Bank of
N. S. Wales has a son in the service, and he
has got the job of private sec. to It. T. Hilder,
lately chief metropolitan inspector, who has
become inspector of branches outside N. S.
Wales. But the service is much more in-
terested for the moment in the return of
Harry F. Rawson. Rawson is the man over
whom the fight has been made by the Bank
Clerks’ Association, and whose old stool the
Industrial Court has ordered to be dusted for
him. The Full Court plainly thought it
was a dreadful order for any Court to make;
but there’s the law, it said, and groaned in
its agony.
Zora Cross, who lives up the mountains
these days, has been busy giving lectures at
the Teachers’ College and the Women’s Col-
lege on literature generallv and Australian
women-writers in particular. She has a
novel of her own under canvas, and another
book of poems.
Mark Foy, junior,. who threatens to be-
come quite a lion in the musical world, was
married last month at Portland (U.S.A.) to
Gladys Bonssurn, whose people are among
San Francisco’s oldest inhabitants. Mark
senior and Mrs. Mark are preparing the
fatted calf for the new daughter-in-law.
Union Bank’s general-manager Chambers,
if he worked to programme, spent last week
in France, and caught thg homeward-bound
boat at Marseilles on the 10th. When he
sailed from Australia in February to attend
the bank’s annual meeting in London he had
the family luggage to look after; but the
girls remain behind with mother to be near
a young doctor-brother who is doing 12
months’ post-graduate training. Inciden-
tally, after hearing what the g.m. had to say
about h.c.l. and others things in Australia,
the Board passed the staff a hefty cash
bonus.
Death opened the door last week and
released Matron Croft from her long suffer-
ing. The Pines, Randwick’s big private hos-
pital. had for many years been her care.
Mrs. Simpson and Helen are returning to
England, brother’s marriage with Ursula
Catterall being indefinitely postponed on ac-
count of his health —the trouble is nerves, the
result of long service as a flying-man. Helen
won’t be here to see her one-act play pro-
duced by the S.U.D.A. on its All-Australian
night. The programme is to also include
a drama in blank verse by Le Gay Brereton
and a one-act bit of psychology by Nora
McAuliffe.
Talking of psychology brings one to
George Lambert’s reply to the lady at the
Art show who asked him to explain the psy-
chology of his big canvas, “Important
People.” George of the laughing beard and
the glad eye was terror-stricken by the
word, but explained that the main thing
that goes to the painting of a picture is the
kind of food the artist absorbs. “Now,"
said lie, “when I was painting the pugilist
I lived on. beefsteak and Bass’s ale, but when
I was painting the lady’s throat —ah, then
1 nourished myself exclusively on breast of
capon and sparkling wines.”
Clothes have always been a super-sense
with Mrs. Philip Morton, and now she has
fastened on a fascinating georgette apron
over her dress, and is setting out to capi-
talise her knowledge. The little house in
Pitt-street can hang out- the sign “Under
\ ice-Regal Patronage,” and as for Darling
Point it simply can’t be kept away. Last
week the scaffolding was erected to build
some garments for Clara Butt. Eugenie
Moreau, one of Sydney’s smartest dressers in
the younger set, is designing for the same
firm. v
John Moore painted one of the few pic-
tures bought by the Gallery fyom this year’s
Society of Artists'
show. The canvas
is “Morning Sky,”
and is so full 'of
dreamstuff that it
conveys no hint of
the strenuous young
man whose main am-
bition in life (when
he isn’t architecting
for his bread and
meat) is to deal a
smashing blow at
those in authority
wli o replace th <•
beautiful old trees
in the parks by col-
lections of electric-
light poles, and who
erect ugly statues in
prominent places.
What he thinks of the vandals who want to

Renwiek Hospital for Infants, being

will have breathing-room in abundance for
Australia’s best assets. Those who remem-
bered CarleiJon in its prime, when it was the
hospitable home of surgeon Ilarry Critchley
Hinder in his strenuous and too-brief years,
will see a great change. The grounds are
as fresh and fair, as ever, but new buildings
are springing up all over the extensive
lawns. Bright-looking, glassed-in receptiou
rooms, that will admit plenty of light and
air, front the Liverpool-road—an ideal place
compared with the dark, stuffy building in
Valentine-lane.
Pass the word to the black Orpingtons and
white Leghorns in the back paddock that Egg
Day for Sydney Hospital is fixed for Septem-
ber 30. From eight in the morning till six
in the .evening the collectors will be in th**
crypt at St. James’s Church to receive the
baskets of newly-laid.
The soldiers’ children at Matraville have
a fascinating new plaything in the freshly-
turfed reserve —it’s a 77mm. field-gun that
some bit of Australia won from the Germans
during the long fight. They were proud
committee-men, under village godfather J.
Harrison, who welcomed the vice-regal
Forsters to the Settlement. And you should
have heard the way the kiddies cheered his
Ex.’s gentle-faced lady. It was up to them
—they’d got a half-holiday for the party.
The Home for Incurables has bagged sir
knights, starting with Sir Walter and end-
ing with Charles Rosenthal, to launch its
appeal f-or a building-extension fund. In
particular it wants a hospital for cancer
sufferers. The annual meeting is to be held
in the Town Hall on September 30, and that
will give you a fortnight to fill in your
cheque.
The second annual Rose Ball, in aid of
Mount, St. Margaret Hospital, will be held
on October 4. The Paddington Town Hall
has been engaged. Mrs. Harry Rose (no
connection with the title) is secretary.
The Modern Languages Association has
under way its annual polyglot conversazione.
Mrs. Verbrugghen will lift her voice in
French, and there will be bits of Italian,
of Spanish, of German —even English may
get a look-in for a moment. If you want
to form an idea of the practical difficulties
of the housemaids in the Tower of Babel,
call at the Department of Education’s Exhi-
bition Room on September 16.
The Carrington Convalescent Hospital,
like all the rest of the world, is feeling the
high prices; so on Sept. 16 the vestibule of
Her Majesty’s will be turned into a market-
place, and the proceeds will go towards re-
ducing the hospital’s overdraft.
Living in quiet retirement at Watersleigl).

CLOTHES
A FACTOR IN BUSINESS.
The well-dressed man scores in the world of business. His personality is
enhanced by the clean-cut, graceful lines of a perfectly-fitting suit.
To dress well—quietly and yet distinctively—requires time and care; time,
because the tailor cannot do justice to his skill if he is hurried; and care
because not every- shade and pattern will suit your personality.
Buckley’s Standard Suits
at 7i Guineas
have a wide range of designs and colors and mark the wearer as a man of
character and discrimination.

ANSWERS TO CORRESPONDENTS.
-Vo notice (except of a hostile character) will be
taken of communications insufficiently stamped.
Name and address must appear on the MSS. No
liability is undertaken re contributions volun
tarily submitted; and no MS. will be returned
unless stamps accompany.
Advance: For everything we print. Indi-
cate the pars to the accountant (best to cut them
out and give date and page), and he will remit.
. ...C.J.T.: There seems to be a hint of something
there; but. we don't get the hang of your scheme.
. ...A.L.H.: Not without merit: but there are lines
that jar badly... .H.W.G.: Sorry, afraid the in-
terest is too 10ca1.... Ali S.: One isn’t printable;
the other is an old cobber. .. .Oran: It would be
too bad to queer that philanthropist’s pitch....
F.T.P.: Like to, but we haven’t the room. Even
now, in order to get in, an Abo. par must beat at
least eight competitors for the space Oliver B.:
This has the right note:—
Ali, now we have something to keep us warm,
Out in bitter days and cold nights;
’Twill wear and wear, never' get torn,
Something really good, good for the eyesight.
Then why not go in for Australia’s best?
Build up our home: our home!
No fear of it not standing the best of. test,
So lovely dressed and handsome.
Now all good Australians do act likewise,
Buy Australia’s best of stuff;
It’s nothing much to sermonise—
The Austral’s good enough and really tough.
....Chip C.: “Wong” is too horrible. ... J.H.: Not
enough moat in “Haggard”... .G.B. (Coonabarabran) :
The “Wonga” pen-name belongs to an old contributor.
You must find another. .. .Svdna M.: No use....
L.P.8.A.: Not for us K.E.C.8.8.: Weak in all
its legs... .K.M.L.: Very poor stuff.... Valeria C.:
Doesn’t strike us... .C.L.G.: “Santa Claus” not
suitable. .. .M.AAV.: The first rule is “Be your-
self.” The greater number of those rwlio fail do
so because they are not natural and direct N.T.
(Darlinglmrst): The verse is very poor and imita-
tive ; the prose is on a track too well trodden....
E.C. (Roma): Yarn has color, but is too conven-
tional. .. .E.J.R.: Sheer waste of time. .. .C. 8.11.:
“Blind Trail” must go back.... John S.: Not for
u 5.... Carlton M.: The “Gropers” get near; but the
octave is too obscure in places. .. .Toad: Sorrowful
attempt in horrible verse. ... W.T.J.: Strangely dull.
....Howard D.; A disappointment.. . .J.K.8.: The
revised version is not more attractive. ... Harry L.;
Bad. .. . VV.K.K.: We don't like our widows so
mechanical M.C.: It’s a very commonplace
“Forest Stream”... .A. G.F. : Well told; but there
isn’t much yarn in it, is there?.... L.0.J.: “Clouds”
thin.... Etta: Doesn’t hit us very hard W.E.8.;
“Burgin” starts well and ends rottenly. By the
way, “onto” is an ugly word. There is not one
example of its use by a writer of first-class prose ;
and no example at all of its use by even a bad
writer earlier than about 50 years ago... . W.D.W.:
Verse not attractive.... Marjorie C.: In a general
way a stanza of four, lines should have two sets
of rhymes; and it is better to make each stanza
complete in itself. Your phrasing is good ; get your
form better.... 5.8.5.: Very lumpy.... Vincent: Not
enough in Peter. .. .O’Racle: No good. .. .Old Tramp
S.: Sorry to say the verses are not nearly good
enough.... Paula: “Mr. Pye” won’t d 0... .C.K.K.:
None of them get near. .. .C. 8.11.: “One-Eyed God”
is too heavy... .C.A.J.: Merest commonplace....
Kathleen B.: No use.... J.A.V.S.; Not what we
hanker f0r.... Attaboy: “Red Dog” yarn doesn't
work out we 11.... Hilda B.: Unsatisfactory kind of
story.... Hutton R.: Cultivate an ear: you don’t
seem to have a good sense of metre. .. .
5.N.0.: The idea was there, but you haven’t given
it any grip.... Oriel: It’s u terrifying piece of in-
sanity. ... .W.E.L.: Well, well! .. .. Bardoe : You
make nothing of it... .C:C.M.. Why so ponderous?
....Billy Due: Parodies are a bad habit; and
yours isn't a bright parody.... Fusiyama: The fact
that it is a translation doesn't make a poor little
idea any richer 1.5. W.: The “Ships” are ancient
vessels that carry the same old cargo. ... L.P.J.:
You are not going to rhyme “violence” with
“silence” in this paper... .W.McV.: The “Solomon”
verse is very lumpy i.M.T. Not up... .8.C.C.:
“But, Ah” wanted a little more point. .. .N.A.E.:
“Picnic” wouldn’t interest our big crowd. .. .G.M.
(Adavale) : Poor stuff.... FC.M.: No, thanks....
Amolekife: Not enough in it... . 1.G.J.: Off The
Bulletin’s track. .T.W.D.: Not worth it.... Qua-
ndary: Too long-drawn 0ut.... Tramway Kat e : Try
again 1.W.E.W.: Too small for our net....
H. 8.: Pencil copy not legible enough.... Kat:
Similar yarn already printed; have another shot...
Chasm: Compression needed.... C.M.: Your friend
is suspect; the yarn’s old. .. .F.S.M.: Merely dis-
gusting.... Deed Poll: Not ven' keen on it. Accord-
ing to the last available statistics only about 8 p.c.
of the natives of India could read and write; and
that vast proportion of illiteracy would give the
fizzy demagogue a tremendous power Tam Tin:
The Bulutekn can’t miss these two or three verses,
anyway:—
When going to my work one day
i watc-ned a little child at play ;
He played at horses on a. stick,
I believe he was a little brick
In the land of make-believe.
And politicians break the new?
They don’t depend upon their thews;
They sit in broadcloth air their views,
Religiously they draw their screws,
A game of make-believe.
And now the last snuff’s on the wick,
I hope that death he will be quick ;
I’ll go to Heaven if it’s on tick,
And, like the kiddie with the stick,
Play a game of make-believe.
. ...E.M.E.: There’s music in it, but not quite
enough of anything else Slim T.: “Pigeon” moves
too slowly for that sort of thing. It has humor, but
is of wearisonje length.... Paddy if.: “Expert”
shows the sort of knowledge you ought to be able
to turn into acceptable pars... .J. Veldt: Hardly. .. .
S.G.W.: “Ethics” was promising; but it didn’t man-
age to keep us from 3-awning. .. .C.8.H.: “Inter-
loper” has merits, but the manner is too heavy for
the matter... .P.C.C.: “Ziffs” just fails —you always
seem to be on the edge.
TO ARTISTIC (AND INARTISTIC)
CORRESPONDENTS.
L.C.: That joke got the old-age pension years ago.
. ...J.W.S.: No good. .. . A.M.: Some original points
about that parson... .H.G.: Promising, but a long
way to go yet. .. . T.T.: Where did you see bathing-
boxes like that ?.,...A.L.: Feeble from every angle.
. ...C.S.: Ruled out... . R.H.S.: Well below standard
yet....A.E.: All hopeless... .J.B. (Melb.) : That
truck’s a mechanical triumph.... D. 0.: Misses....
J.B. (Bankstown) : Looks like an aeroplane accident
. ...N.C.S.: Not up.. ..Jim Crow: Faulty drawing.
H.S.C.: Idea not worth it R.W.McH.: Amaz-
ing cattle. .. .H.P.S.: Too scratch}’....ll.W.T.: Both
gone west.

Could There Be Better Proof of the
Value of Rexona Than This?
Master CUNNINGHAM
( from, a photo).
My little boy Jack, aged seven years, met with
a very bad accident eleven months ago through a
wall collapsing on him, with the result that he
was in hospital for four months. He had half of
his foot torn away, and the doctors thought they
would have to amputate it above the ankle, but
after a lot of treatment and skin-grafting I got
him home, but it lwoke out again and he had to
go back in hospital to have more skin grafted
on. *Then, after he was home a little while, we
tried to get him to use his foot, but it broke away
again, and the doctor said he would have to go
back in hospital again, but I was advised to try
Rexona Ointment, which I did, and only used
two tins and it was completely healed. He has
been walking on it four months now, and lias
not had any trouble with it since. I found
Rexona of great value, and I may tell you that
it saved me a great deal of more trouble and
expense.

Lubricate—
and forget
You can afford to forget your
engine.
Most of it is out of your
sight, anyway; put it out of
your mind, too. That sort of
forgetfulness is not careless-
ness. It’s just a sensation of
luxurious confidence; you’re
entitled to it.
No matter how good your
engine; no matter how well it
works—give it the right lubri-
cation. Every engine is entitled
to good oil.
The wise man uses Texaco
—and then forgets all about
his engine. He can well afford
to, because he knows it’s all
right. He knows that Texaco
Motor Oil is keeping every-
thing working smoothly, with-
out friction.
This luxury of confidence is
yours by right—when you use
Texaco Motor Oils.

[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
“1 /T ACQUAIUE HALL, partly office-
jWl building, partly residential, in a
street of Sydney a little removed
from the noisiest traffic, holds the respect-
ably permanent in its front .rooms of all
floors, and takes precarious office-tenants and
nomads —mere residents of a month or two
—in its apartments at. the hack. The front
offices and residential apartments show brass-
plates and name-cards; the doors of the
back rooms are innocent of advertise-
ment beyond permanent notifications that
the owner will “return in ten minutes.”
Some of these are plainly false, seeing that
their owners were tenants who left months
ago and forever —such persistent failures
that at last they had failed to pay the rent.
Most permanent and therefore most re-
spectable of the tenants of the front apart-
ments was Miss Chariot, whose arrivals and
departures were so regular as to remind the
observer of the arrival and departure of a
daily train running to its minute.
Miss Chariot, dark, thin, tall, graceful
in her clinging robe of black that was un-
fashionably long as to skirts, passed out
of the street door of Macquarie Hall early
one morning. Her graceful flowing gown
said something more than that she was an
artist in clothes; it said also that she had
put a period to her life before the war,
when long skirts were the mode. She passed
on, graceful, beautiful in a faded way, a
lady with more than the quietness of lady-
ship, a woman resigned as if she had lost,
yet whom loss had not soured but subdued.
She was a “permanent,” but even Mrs.
Capper, the housekeeper, knew little of her
beyond her voice—a quiet voice that could
touch beauty and that told of a quiet mind.
Thirty-five and she looked 25; hut if the
happiness inseparable from a beloved man
and his baby did not come to her soon, five
years hence she would look like 45, and at
50 she would seem 10 years older. That
is, if she had not been of the fine steel she
was; slight and graceful, easy to bend and
hard to break; the good metal that wears
well. She was a merchant’s secretary sud-
denly promoted to almost executive func-
tions in addition to secretarial duties be-
cause of the war. For the rest, she lived in
the front rooms of the second-floor and came
home early in the evening and departed early
in the morning, and from Saturday after-
noon to Monday morning was at home rest-
ing and forgetting her masculine work of
the week in duties very feminine —mostly
sewing clothes.
As Miss Chariot left the building a girl
whom she had seen approaching carrying a
suit-case and looking up at the houses with
the eyes of the homeless, addressed her halt-
ingly. “I—l—beg your pardon,” she said
and stopped.
Miss Chariot looked at her onlv then, and
was impressed. She was slight and dark
and graceful, and might have been a small
edition of Miss Chariot herself.
“Yes?” said Miss Chariot.
“Can you direct me to Mrs. Capper?
Maennarie Hall, it is.”
‘ This is it. I live there. Mrs. Capner
is the housekeeper. Come in and I’ll find
her ior you. '
Miss Chariot ascended the stairs to the
iirst floor, and as she reached it the large
shapeless mass that was Mrs. Capper taced
her suddenly as if she had been lying in
wait, , „
“There’s a lady below wishes to see you.
‘“Lady? I want no ladies here. Miss
Chariot. We’re glad to have you, of course;
but I wouldn’t have women here for all
their weight in gold,” , T
"It would depend on their weight, 1
think.” . ...
•You know what I mean, They make so
much trouble; and you can’t get any help.
Six of them came here from the registry-
office to look at the piace and never came
back to work. One of them said she
wouldn’t work in a place without Jk hu;
there were too many stairs, she said.”
“Shall I send the young girl up?”
““JNO, I’ll come down. But I won t let
to women.”
M ith the activity of the stout who are
also strong, Mrs. Capper followed Miss
Chariot downstairs, and Miss Chariot left;
her talking to the girl, who had r.dt come
as a buyer of space, but as a seller of labor.
For as Miss Chariot left the hall she heard
the girl say, “The registry-office sent me.
Are you Mrs. Capper?” . .
Mrs. Capper next day gave her opinions
of the new help to Mrs. Ilardie, who was
caretaker of the Ashe building, and to Miss
Church, who lived with Mrs. Ilardie and
was now retired from all activities--except
such as pertained to her position of Busy-
body-ln-Chief and the latest scandal edition
of the quarter. She was impartial in her
scitndal-hiongoring, inventing sins for cer-
tain unapproved flats and buildings if there
were; no individual sinners of the moment
heeding correction by damnation.
“I could hardly b’lieve it,” said Mrs.
Capper. “Rut the registrar offUs had sent
hfer, and there she is, very slow but hard
workin’. On’y 1 doii’t like these broken-,
down ladies about me. I’d have gone on
f’revei* without help rather thah engage her,
0n1y....y’ never knbw, and she’s too quiet
for her age.” . .
“Men will be men,” was the contribution
of Mrs. Hardie, uttered as if the old fUct
were an absolutely new discovery.
“Brutes!” said the ancient virgin. Un-
vairchusness! That’s what causes wars.
Unvairchusness! This influenzy is a judg-
ment on the unVairchus.”
As Mrs. Capper left them this newest
variation of the old subject drew the other
two together against all minor differences
of opinion. From their discussion they came
to the conclusion that both Miss Torrance,
the new girl, and her introducer, Miss Char-
iot, were suspect sufficiently to be watched.
Their heads came together whenever the
new help quietly passed to her afternoon
hour in the grassy square. They saw that
she sewed at some material while she sat in
the sunny square with the palms and flowers
about her; and one day as she passed them
on her return they saw that she lagged a
little in her walk, and their ferret eyes
searched for the reason. Then they looked
at one another and whispered; and Miss
Torrance, raising her eyes at the moment,
saw that, they were talking of her and lifted
her head again, and walked on, her face
aflame.
“We must tell Mrs. Capper.”
“Not yet—be sure first. Then she must
be told* It is our duty,” added Miss Church
piously. “There’s a curse on the unvairchus
and ‘ail who are not with Me are against Me.
Get thee behind me, Satan ■
But if Satan heard, Satan, being at least
a gentleman, made no sign.
* * * *
Three nights later, as Miss Chariot came
to Macquarie Hall after dinner and was
opening her own door, she saw Miss Tor-
rance enter carrying an evening newspaper
opened to the broad sheet; and Miss Chariot
saw that the girl was weeping.
“Can I help?” asked Miss Chariot, by
whom the pain of others was felt in sym-
pathy.
“No! No, no! No, thank you,” said the
girl. “I’m just tired—thank you.”
She ascended the stairs, stopped half-way.
said again “Thank you—good night,” and
ascended from sight.
Not satisfied with the exnlanation, Miss
Chariot took the liberty of thinking of the
apparent unhappiness of the girl above.
“She’s superior to the work, anyhow; and
the poor girl seems to have had a shock.
She was readinsr the Evening Times. It
was open at the middle pages. I’ll look.”
She turned to the centre pages of the
Times, saw the heading “Casualty List,”
then studied it to find the only name the
name of the girl suggested. And there it
was. “Bombardier Torrance —killed in
action.” Her brother, or
In a room above Mrs. Capper’s on the
fourth floor the new help tearlessly read and
re-read the fatal line, and scarcely moved
when Miss Chariot knocked at the door.
“Come in,” said the new girl.
“I thought you were in trouble. Can I
help?”
The tearless condition was excited to hys-
terical refusal. “No! No! No! No ! O
my God ! No !”
“Let me help you, dear,” said the elder
woman, seating herself on the bed and draw-
the eirl to her arms.
“No, no, no! I can’t bear it. O my
God ! I can’t tell you.”
“I think I know. One of our men killed
in action?”
“Yes, yes, that’s it. Dead! Oh, I can’t
bear it!”
“Your brother?” and as soon as Miss
Chariot asked the question she knew it for
the foolish question it was.
“No, no! I have no brothers—onlv sis-
ters. He was everything in the world to
me. And now he’s dead. I’ll go mafi —I
can’t bear it.”
“Were you married?”
“Oh. don’t ask me that! You mean to be
kind, but don’t ask me that.”
“It was only the name. You were to
have been married?”
“Yes, but he was ordered off before we
expected. He thought he’d get a final leave,
but tbev hurried him off to be killed. Oh !

by the ZAM-BUK method
is daily producing more and
more wonderful results/ Just try ZAM-BUK on any
spot, pimple or cut you may have. You will be astonished
at the swift, painless and effective way ZAM-BUK has.
The unparalleled success of ZAM-BUK comes from its
monopoly of certain refined herbal extracts —the result of many years’
scientific research for a healer superior to and without the known draw-
backs of fatty ointments. These herbal extracts are blended together in a
particular manner. There is nothing else at all like ZAM-BUK. The wonderful
AGONISING SCALDS HEALED
Mrs. A. Edwards, Herbert Street., Brisbane,
says:—“Whilst cooking I accidentally upset
a pot of boiling water. The Seething
liquid poured over my right knee, arm
and hands, causing most painful in-
juries. Great blisters caused me
intense agony. I at once care-
fully applied /am-Buk to the
scalds, and found it greatly
reduced the inflammation.
Zam-Buk soothed away
the terrible pain, and
the injuries began to
heal up beauti-
fully. As new
skin formed
all trace of
the wounds
d i s a p-
peared.
BOILS on the NECK
PURIFIED and CURED.
"Zain-Buk cures thoroughly,”
says Mrs. E. Bourse, of 25
Market Street, Petersham, Syd-
ney. “For a long time my hus-
band suffered, from painful
boils on the neck. We tried
numerous remedies, but there
was no improvement until the
boils were treated with Zam-
Buk. My husband found this
balm wonderfully cooling and
soothing, and it speedily ban-
ished the inflammation and
drew out the pus. After thor-
oughly purifying, the sores,
Zam-Buk healed every one of
them perfectly. I also find
Zam-Buk a splendid healer
for sore hands.”

action of this potent balm is second only to
influence. ZAM-BUK not only prevents
its valuable antiseptic
place taking
sore
“bad ways,” but it actually kills off any dangerous germs. When
ZAM-BUK is applied there is no danger of poison or disease being locked in the sore
as when fatty ointments and salves are used.
ZAM-BUK is unequalled for Cuts, Burns, Scalds, Scratches, Eczema, Ringworm,
Ulcers, Piles, Scalp Sores, Poisoned Wounds, Sprains, Strained Muscles, etc.
Its absolute safety, its consistent reliability, and its wonderful healing qualities
have made ZAM-BUK “The World’s Greatest Healer.”

they’ve never been disgraced. Oh, do please
show a little pity. Don’t cross-question me
when I'm mad with grief and dying because
I can’t cry. I can’t cry—there’s no relief
for me.”
“Poor girl! I’ll question you no more.
But I'm a friend. \\ m you come to me
to-morrow, and let’s plan sometningV 1 m
alone like you—quite alone..’
The community of pain made Miss Tor-
rance interested despite herself. IS lie looked
up and asked a question in a look, and the'
elder woman responded, nodding her head in
affirmation; the memories of old agony in
her eyes, and the smile of sorrow, faced
bravely, on her lips.
“And did he die?”
Miss Chariot shook her head.
“Oh, he left you. llow could he? Ned
Torrance would never have left me. They
took him away to be killed —killed! 6
my God !”
"Shall I help you into bed?”
"No, no, no, no! Only let me be. Thank
you, but let me be !”
"Then I’ll come to you in the morning;
and if you want me in the night promise me
you’ll call me. 1 sleep very lightly, and
I’ll come.”
'“Thank you. You’re a good friend.
I’ll call you if I must. Kiss me, will you?”
“Ah, my dear!”
In her . own room, the memory quickened
in, her by that conversation with the girl,
Miss Chariot turned back the leaves that
record youth; but, soon rebuking herself
for uselessly living yesterday oyer again
while vowing that remembrance was a mere
folly long a go abandoned, she suddenly opened
a diTssinjg-case and from its buttoned
pocket took out a packet of letters and a
wedding-ring. Still chiding herself for the
foolish weakness that meant a return to
pain, she slipped the ring on the marriage
finger; aI id as she looked at the light glint-
ing on ili, yesterday came back and was the
monvnnt. She saw again the man who had
loved, ad d could not marry her; the ring
that wi is their respectability in those
stolen 'Gays and weeks, in summer by
the sea } md in winter at some quaint hotel
or other in the rainy bush; great red lilies
upon tin sandstone they only saw in bud
because they never came back to see the
bloom: 1 he grey old hamlet with its red-
bricked c hurch and its crazy clock that was
never wil hin an hour of the time; the quiet
shallows, by the grassy street and the mill-
race tide below the bridge to sea; the red
tips of the young gum-trees, and the rain
upon the roof- —rain that made shelter
dearer and warmth the warmer, because,
without, 1 cold winds blew upon the unhappy.
She re membered the day the man who
could nol marry her left her, and a tear
fell upon the ring; and then she thought
again of that happiness that none could take
away, an! d in gratitude to the past she kissed
the ring 1 before hiding it again. But in the
darkness ishe cried for her loneliness, and then
for the lo neliness of the girl who might not
be as lon» ly as she, because—because
* a * *
At 11 o’clock that night Mrs. Capper,
being dtily and dutifully warned by Mrs.
Hardie and the ancient virgin Miss Church
that all who countenance unvairchusness
shall be damned with the unvairchus, quietly
and, respectably ascended the stairs to the
girl’s room and tapped upon the door,
"I’m in bed, Mrs. Capper.”
“The door is locked —open it!”
"Not to-night, please. I'm very sad; not
to-night.”
"I’ll make no disturbance to-night,” said
Mrs. Capper—-“IVe got respectable people
m the house. I wouldn’t let Miss Cnariot
know this for worlds. But I’ve found you
out. Out of this place you go to-morrow.
Do you hear?” /
"I hear, Mrs. Capper. I’ll go.”
Snorting, but snorting gently, so that re-
spectability on the second floor should not
know crime on the fourth, Mrs. Capper went
to bed, satisned that she had done right in
listening to Mrs. Hardie and that ancient
virgin whose ostentatious virtue added to
more than natural curiosity had made her
razor-l Hen to every happening of sex. And
the informers slept happily, satisfied with
their own virtue, as all the self-righteous
and all they who rhake cruelty for Christ’s
sake.
There was no sleep in the room on the
topmost floor. The deep violet night, star-
lit and dim, seemed to sag downward to that
house; a blacker night ’came to the soul
of the girl who had risen from her bed
in anguish and looked into half-darkness
with eyes dilated by fear. The sudden grief
for the death of her man was subconsciously
being replaced by a ; second sorrow, more per-
sonal, and hastened by’ the first. She sat
and watched the deepening of the night
tearless and leaden-liearted, as from the
condemned cell the convict sees his last
sunrise. And this girl had suffered more
than most, for she had high imagination, and
it had tnadd her endow her lover with all the
qualities of ' had made .her
giving easy as it now made the effect seem
terrible. The night nested on half the
world; she sat there looking, unseeing, at
the procession of the stars. Tears were
dried up in her. A month ago she had
awakened crying for her loneliness in the
dead waste of the night, when, to the sleep-
less, evil walks the world and life ebbs like
a tide returning to the deep sea. She was
more than awake now, keenly anticipating
the imminent, yet feeling so weak that she
must sink through the house—feeling that;
the world itself had not the strength to hold
her up against that dread of the cruelty of
death searching for his new victim in the
dark.
Yet all her anger and contempt were for
the two buzzards of scandal who had looked
at her thaff afternoon..
And then the quick agony again! Should
she call Miss Chariot': 1 No, no, no, no!
Nobody should know. The pain would pass
—it could not be yet—and to-morrow she
would go away and hide again.
“O Cod, I’m only twenty-two ! Mother !
Mother ! O my God !”
The sky reverberated her cry as prayers
fa'll back to earth; the stars marched—
patient, scarless, without trace of age or fear
of death; not a breath of the air she
breathed moved to her agony. Yet she had
looked for help to the firmament.
"It’s no use, there’s no God! I didn’t
make myself love him —I couldn’t help it!
O God ! O God!”
Her mouth, bone-dry with anguish; her
cries smothered at their beginning that Re-
spectability might not be aroused to ask the
reason why; and while the stars marched
from midnight to the sky-rim, the girl iay
down to her groaning.
* * *• *
At 11 o’clock next morning Mrs. Capper
was proving her possession of a heart as
much by her cold reception of the two virtu-
ous busybodies, Mrs. llardie and Miss
Church, as by her explanation to Miss
Chariot. "I’ll never forgive myself,” she
said. “Never! The poor girl going to her
trouble, and me calling to her through the
closed door to clear out in the morning. And
now she’ll never go anywhere but one place
the poor thing’s baby either.”
"I suspected it,” said Miss Chariot. “Poor
girl! But I couldn’t think it could be so
near. Of course,” she added in self defence
that was unnecessary, "I don’t know any-
thing about that.”
“It was the shock of the casualty list.
Her name was Eily Spain. I found these
letters in her bag, and the poor girl’s clothes
for the baby, and I ’phoned her relations.
The poor mother! What a shock to her!
Very respectable people they are —they’re
in the telephone book.”
“How did you find out?”
"I went there at seven this morning to
tell her she need not do anything—just to
go with an extra week’s wages. And then
no answer; and my husband broke in the
door. Oh, my dear! My dear !.... terrible!
I got the charwoman in at once, and the
undertaker’s been and I’ve ’phoned to her
people—they’ll be here at 12 o’clock.
And you’re late for your office. This has
upset everybody.”
Said Miss Chariot, faintly smiling: “I
didn’t sleep till nearly daylight—that poor
girl set me thinking—and I didn’t wake
until you knocked. I’ll dress and ’phone the
office that I’m ill—l’m too shocked to work
to-day.”
“You look it, too, poor thing. I’m tough,
but this has got me down. If those two
scandalisers come here I’ll give them some-
thing to go on with.”
She slightly rolled up her sleeves as if to
clear for action, laughed at herself, and went
down the stairs looking as if she were about
to cry, the good heart blaming the hasty
tongue.
Miss Chariot thought again of the dead;
of the mother and the sisters on the way; of
all this respectability that, when injured,
replaced natural affection. Eily Spain she
was; but let her be Mrs. Torrance to them,
and they would be too relieved by the com-
fort of believing her married to seek further
proof.
“Mrs. Capper will stand by me,” thought
Miss Chariot. "There’s no certificate, but
they mightn’t ask for it. The funeral notice
can saj; ’Torrance’ and it doesn’t matter if
the registrar of deaths knows the facts. But
even he needn’t know—the three concerned
are dead. Of course we could dig up a
marriage certificate for the registrar: but
the relatives won’t be so searching. We’ve
only to tell them that -Mrs. Torrance told us
she had kept her marriage a secret in obedi-
dience to her husand. No certificate —tom
there can be something else.”
She had thought of it already. In her
room again she took from the dressing-case
the letters and the ring, and put back the
letters. She looked at the ring and saw
herself again as the wife-in-secret in those
stolen days and nights and weeks. The
sacrifice moved her as the first wrench of
that last farewell to her partner-in-the-ring
had pained her years ago. She slipped the
ring on her marriage-finger as she ascended
to Eily Spain’s room on the fourth floor.
The door was open and the window wide,
but with drawn blinds, and the hum of the
square came to her. The room was very
white and very still, and the woman lifted
the sheet from the face of the shrouded
figure. Eily Spain’s fac* still had a little
fear in it,, her eyes closed, her young-girl's
face in its linen, a black lustrous rope of
hair trailed over her shoulder, her left arm
across her breast.
Miss Chariot drew down the sheet ani
saw the dead child, bloodless as the mother,
but with the ghost of the ruddiness of birth
upon its face, lying in the crook of the dead
girl’s arm.
“Poor girl! Poor baby ! So very little to
die —so very young! Not woman and child;
only two children.”
The fingers «f her right hand went to the
ring. She drew it off and then replaced it
suddenly, almost with passion ; and then she
looked at Eily Spain as if Eily Spain were
pleading for conventional redemption, and
her right hand went back to her left. Her
beloved dead past came back to her; she
could not bury its outward and visible sign,
so secret that to all but herself it was invis-
ible.
And then she looked again upon the face
of Eily Spain and knew that the ring buried
with the dead girl would still i>e as real to
her as if it stayed above the ground. For
there was really nothing left of love but the
memory of it.
She pulled the sheet lower and took the
left hand of Eily Spain and put the ring
upon the marriage-finger and replaced the
sheet, and then she stooped to the dead face
and kissed Eily Spain, and said, as if she
had at last, if tardily, kept a promise made
long before: “There, my dear, my dear!”
There were the sounds of feet upon the stair,
the gasping of Mrs. Capper as she ascended,
leading the visitors, and lying like an angel.
“IVe were all very fond of Mrs. Torrance.
She was goin’ to send for you to-day; but
the news of her husband’s death must have
caused it before its time. Ah, she was a fine
girl—God rest her !”
“It’s all right, dear —it’s all right,” said
Miss Chariot to the frozen figure on the bed.
She waited the arrivals with triumph in
her eyes. _

Words to the Wise
Most of us enjoying good
health and spirits are
careless of our diet.
We eat more and oftener than we should, foods which
sooner or later upset the stomach. Then trouble sets in,
taking the form of biliousness, indigestion, sleeplessness,
dizziness and languor. We feel ill, cross and stupid; we
become bores to our friends and to ourselves; life
becomes a thing of horror not worth living. Yet, all
this is absolutely unnecessary. Stop, think a ♦moment!
