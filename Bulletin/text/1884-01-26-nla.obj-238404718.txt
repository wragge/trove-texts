Pity ’tis, ’tis True.
The Soudan business would probably be re-
cognised as “ajudgment” had it been the
French,, and not the English, who seized
Egypt. The sequences of events frequently
bring to mind the lines of Walter Scott —
“ Oh, what a tangled web wo weave
When first wo nractice to deceive.”
Our filibustering expedition to Egypt is
bearing bitter fruit. The whole history is
pitiful; and, were it not that history is but
one long record of similar infamies perpe-
trated by every civilised country and Go-
vernment in turn, one might feel ashamed of
being an Englishman. The trouble began a
couple of hundred years ago, when a parcel
of piratical traders—and, in the good old
days, there was very little distinction be-
tween a merchant and a buccaneer—forced
a footing in Hindostan. and ended by be-
coming, under the style of “The Honourable
East India Company,” masters of almost
the entire peninsula, with a private army
and a navy of their own — a legalised
force of highly respectable and socially
recognised pirates and buccaneers — the
servants of no State, Government, or
Sovereign, but simply of the Board of
Directors in Leadenhall-street, London. In
due course of time, the arrogance, oppres-
siveness, and plundering of these highly
reputable buccaneers, being utterly intoler-
able to the native people and princes who
had been plundered and superseded, pro-
voked a desperate effort to cast off their
yoke, accompanied by the horrible outrages
and excesses which invariably attend the
insurrection of a people who have been long
crushed under systematic outrage and
habitual excesses. The buccaneers, how-
ever, had by this time identified themselves
with our nation. The spoil was so immense,
and the task of guarding it so arduous, that
an immense number of fingers were in thepie.
The British nation thrust the buccaneering
Board on one side, and adopted its responsi-
bilities and the dry rind which was left of
its squeezed provinces. The Indian national
revolt was crushed; and, as there were still
pickings for younger sons, and a consider-
able remnant of plunder for a favoured
few—albeit the unlucky natives just
managed to exist and pay taxes in good
seasons, and starved by millions and ab-
sorbed taxes in bad seasons—our rulers
clung to the stolen provinces.

A Frenchman proposed to provide a short
cut from England to India. He was an
engineer, not then very eminent. Our very
eminent engineers laughed derisively at his
craze when he proposed to out a canal
between two oceans. Our most distin-
guished statesman objected to the notion
altogether, on the not unsubstantial grounds
that the more practicable it was the more
objectionable it would be, inasmuch as Ave,
the greatest naval power in the world, had
complete 'supremacy on the ocean route to
our dependency, besides owning all the ports
on the way—St. Helena, the Cape, and
Mauritius. For these A'ery reasons the
Emperor of the French favoured the
project, and gave it the support which
Enabled the projector to accomplish it.
A new and shorter road to India was
created, and at the moment that the sluices
admitted the waters of the Mediterranean
into the new channel, the current of British
diplomacy flowed violently and inevitably
in the same direction, and the Eastern
question took a permanent deviation to
East by South. The new waterway passed
through the Egyptian territory, and the
Egyptian people were at the time under the
rule of a foreign Prince—grandson of a
Turkish vice-regent, who had been at once
a usurper and a rebel. This Prince, himself
a feudatory of the Caliph and Sultan,
lent himself, or rather sold himself, to the
designs of the French. He permitted him-
self to be Avhat was termed imbued with
the spirit of Westeim civilization and
policy. He undertook to develop the re-
sources of his country, and to that end bor-
rowed money in magnificent style He de-
veloped the resources of his country by
introducing Italian opera and French bal-
let, by building numerous palaces, and
engaging in a variety of grand works, which
proved extremely profitable to everybody—
except his subjects. As the security he
offered was extremely good, being the in-
dustry of a most frugal, laborious, and
thoroughly broken-spirited people, and as
he was not at all particular what terms he
got so long as the money was forthcoming,
all the great usurers of Europe crowded
round him and thrust their purses into his
pocket, reselling and distributing his bonds
at their real value throughout France and
England, and thus making their repayment
a matter of national concern in two great
States. As the various loans became due for
repayment, the Prince, in the fashion fami-
liar to all spendthrift landlords, did not
abate his oavu extravagance, but squeezed
his people. Presently, however, these were
squeezed so hard, and the mortgaged
country was so swarming with “men
in possession ” living on the fat of
the land at ruinous cost, that the
Prince became uneasy and intractable. He
still squeezed the people all he dared, but
the limit of his courage was to squeeze
enough for his own necessities. Fearing the
effects of the despair of his racked people,
he began to counter-plot with them, and to
wink at dodges for not paying more than
sufficed for his own requirements. The in-
dignant holders of his promissory notes
thereupon moved their respective Govern-
ments, and got the Prince ejected, and his
son, who, in consideration of being allowed
to succeed to the encumbered estates, was
ready to accept a smaller allowance than his
parent, and to live a gilded existence with
bailiffs disguised as lackeys — Financial
Advisers and Ministers of States were their
official designations—constantly surround-
ing him as part of his establishment, was
put in as Bailiff The creditors were better
paid, but the exactions upon the people
became intolerable; and at last, headed by a
man of resolute character, Ababi, they re-
volted against the frightful and insupport-
able system which reduced them to hopeless
misery and penury.
♦ * ■
At this crisis, the usurers were equal to
the occasion. They saw their victims on the
point of escaping from their clutches, and
they raised a yell that England’s road to
India was in peril. Thereupon, by some
mysterious chance or device which only time
can elucidate, the Prime Minister of Eng-
land, a man Avhose whole life had been em-
bellished by his appreciation of the aspira-
tions of wronged and oppressed races, not
only admitted the validity of this fictitious
cry, but went to extraordinary lengths. He
might have secured command of the water-
way, and left the people, the Bailiff, and the
usurers to settle their own differences. But
he hotly adopted the usurers’ cause, sent
troops to maintain their Bailiff in possession,
and, after massacring a host of the luckless
wretches who had revolted against the most
grinding and heartless system of plunder
ever recorded, made the nation he led re-
sponsible for the security of the whole
country.
♦ * *
He lent his countenance to the re-organi-
zation of the squeezing system, and sanc-
tioned the appointment, as chief of the ex-
tortion corps, of a desperate adventurer, of
infamous character, a British Bashi-Ba-
zouk, who had been adjudged too ruffianly
to hold a commission in the British Army.
He placed at the head of the forces organized
to “ tranquillise ” the wretched Egyptians a
scoundrel Arhose chief notoriety was due to
the circumstances that even the restraints
of civilized society had been insufficient to
control his brutal passions, which, spurning
all considerations of consequences, had im-
pelled him to attempt, in time of peace, and
on a girl of his own nation, the outrage
which is ordinarily denounced, when perpe-
trated amidst the horrors of war, upon the
females of an enemy’s people, and Avhich
considerate conquerors are especially care,
ful to spare a quelled enemy. It was as
though General Haynauhad been appointed
to restore confidence and win affection
among the Hungarians, after the repression
of a Magyar revolt—that General Haynau
who used to have women stripped and
flogged.
• • •
The father of the deposed Prince had made
a “ conquest ” far in the heart of Africa. A
conquest never consolidated. The conquest
of a territory constantly in revolt. When
we seized Egypt, its incumbrances and lia-
bilities devolved upon us. Our presence
intensified the revolt in these regions. Just
as we made a grimace of not being really
masters in Egypt and that our officers
were the servants, not the keepers of
that poor tool, the Khedive, so we
pretended that although the army sent
to quell the Prophet - Warrior of the
Soudan was led by British commanders* it
was no army of ours, and its fate conse-
quently not our concern. The rude shock
of a catastrophic defeat has shaken off these
flimsy pretences, and left us face to face with
an ugly alternative. To recover the re-
volted province is a task which would tax
our utmost resources and involve us in
complications of which no man can foresee
the end. To abandon the territory is to
incur the loss of prestige, not merely fan-
ciful but dangerously effectual wherever
we have to reckon Avith Mussulman popula-
tions. And not our own security in Eastern
countries alone is effected. The security and
repose of all Frankish nations similarly
situated with respect to Mahommedan races
is involved. The success of the Mahdi shakes
not merely the Soudan, Nubia, and Egypt,
and India, but it moves the very bowels of
Algeria and Tunis, and through these coun-
tries affects France most vitally. It is doubt-
ful Avhether France, in fact, can afford to
stand quiescent and see the Soudan evacu-
ated. The involvements are stupendous.
One blunder — one wicked blunder — has
plunged the world into a frightful oomph,
cation. Had our rulers been but content to

secure what alone was of national concern,
the Suez Canal, our road to India, Ababi
might have been master of Egypt, and,
supported by the enthusiasm of the people,
would have been either in a better position
to resist the Mahdi, or, if forced to succumb
to him in the Soudan, still remained firm in
Egypt. Loss of prestige to him by abandon-
ment of the Soudan would have caused no
agitation in the Mahommedan world. It
would'have bean Mussalmen against Mussel-
man. And had the Mahdi conquered in Egypt
itself, our rulers would have been in a position
either to treat with the victor, or, failing
that, to oppose to him a resistance along a
line of defence resting on the sea and
navigable waters, and, consequently, the
strongest we could desire, and almost in-
capable of being permanently broken.
PLAIN ENGLISH.
The Sheep and the Shepherd.
Or thirty English bishops, ten are disabled by age
and infirmity to discharge any episcopal duty, be-
yond feebly but prayerfully pocketing incomes
ranging from £1000 to £20,000 a year. The bulk of
this is the direet clip of the flock, but many of
their holinesses are also huge holders of city and
landed property—the investments of pious offer,
ings from men long since gone into the only bit of
freehold now open to the British born—the grave.
Thousands of the lower clergy, meanwhile, are paid
a stipend so miserable that a bricklayer here would
scorn to accept it; and, even of that pittance, he
has to give, winter after winter, to relieve cold
and starvation amongst the tenants of his holy
lordship. It is a known fact that, within a stone’s
throw of a Bishop’s palace, there are dens of the
lowest squalor; and, while the! surpliced Bishop
is warming his gouty old feet at the cheerful
Christmas fire, sipping his toddy, and dreamily
totting up his revenues, or revolving some
ingenious translation to show that Moses in-
vented the telephone, the chill winds, howl-
ing without, tear on their ruthless track
through the creaking doors and ragged windows
that mock with shelter the shivering wretch. The
hail that rattles on the pane gives new zest to the
lot of the holy man of God, as he draws up nearer
the fire. He recks not the hopeless misery at
hand, drawing its flimsy rags closer in, and moan-
ing away the dismal night; or, if he thinks of
them, it is to project fresh levies on his flock—
anything, anything, but “ part ” with that miser-
able dross for which he clings to an office he has
long ceased to be able to fill. What does he care,
though hundreds of the ablest scholars and most
Christian of his clergy struggle with the direst
poverty ? The episcopal revenue is his. It’s the
right thing in'the pulpit to say that the fashion of
this world passeth away—that the love of money
is a sordid passion—and that, in a transitory life
like this, we should fix our eyes on the heavenly
Jerusalem. But it’s another thing when the angel
Gabriel appears unto him in a dream, and says ;
“Just so, old man. Thou hast done some good
work. Take, I pray thee, enough to secure thee
thy three meals a day for thy few remaining
years; but hand over thy work to the
young, the strong, and the vigorous.” Time
was when to be a Bishop meant for pious
zeal to take the lead of the brethren in virtue of
self-denial and ability, but we manufacture
Bishops now as we manufacture brown soap. A
pudding-headed youth is born to a genteel family,
and stuffed with Latin and Greek, when he should
be carting manure or hawking fish. At twenty-
two or three, he has sprawled through a number of
examinations in Middle Age monkery, and he is
presented with a living and a cure of souls— souls,
mark you, when corns might have been the
manifest direction of Nature. Years go on, he
cures souls by keeping them asleep; he writes a
pamphlet to prove that in the sacrament of
Baptism the baby’s toes must be in the sprinkling,
or that a bandy-legged communicant may safely
go through without kneeling, or perchance he
“ Replies ” to Colenso in two volumes. Whatever
it may be, the influence of a rich family,
and the opportunities of politics, present him
with other “livings” on which curates can’t live;
and, finally, he is “ consecrated,” with exceeding
pow-wow and josshousism, a Bishop. A few years’
confirmation of children, a few dismal pastorals
and ponderous sermons, and it is time to join the
gouty third, and settle down to the chief end of
life—the perusal of the bank-book, and an occa-
sional glance at the Bible. And this in a world
said to be drifting to perdition, and undoubtedly
needing hard and heartful toil to reduce the
savagery and misery around. And good people
wonder to hear their holiness’s dignities and huge
fortunes spoken of venomously by the unculti-
vated and struggling poor! Come to think of it,
it is astonishing.
Bulldog Barristers.
In a recent number of the Melbourne Argus
appeared a “ leader ” dealing with a little practice
in our law courts, which, although very common,
wants to be kicked out by some man to whom
shoe-leather is not a consideration. The article is
founded on a letter represented to have been sent
to that paper by one Aiguillon de Gubpe, three
columns long, and written wholly in the French
language. Aiguillon is said to speak strongly on
the latitude indulged in by examining and cross-
examining barristers in our courts. He thinks
they set themselves to Insult and intimidate wit-
nesses, and asserts that, if such things were done
in his sunny land, someone would punch a hole in
the legal gentleman’s head. Of course Aiguillon
is a myth, and his three columns of stricture a
convenient imaginary peg on which to hang a
bristling satire. The practice is not confined to
Victoria. Elsewhere, as well as there, notoriety
pays, and the bullier is reputed clever. Witnesses
have ascended the box under the pressure of a
high sense of duty, and without the slightest per-
sonal Interest in the issue of the case. The oppos-
ing barrister is quite justified in taking legitimate
means to shake the evidence. But the practice is
not to rest with legitimate means. Like a ferret, he
creeps through every avenue of a witness’s charac-
ter, and if only he can find a knuckle of the ver-
tebrae of a dead rabbit, he is vastly proud, and
the yokels spitting about the galleries are mightily
gratified. To those at a distance from our law
courts the following may appear to be a burlesque,
but to those whom business has often taken within
the shrine, it is likely to pass as current history.
The matter is a dog-fight, and a witness, who is a
lady, has to testify that she saw one of tho men in
the dock leading a tan-coloured bulldog in the
direction of where the fight took place.
Barrister : You are Mrs. —Mrs.—Mrs.
Witness : Mrs. Jones.
B. : Ha, yes ; Mrs. Jones. And how long are you
Mrs, Jones ?
W.: Ten years.
B.: Ha, yes. And before that you were Miss-
Miss—Miss —
W.: Miss Brown.
B.: Ha, yes. And what age were you then ?
W.; 39.
B.; Ha, yes. Now, on your oath, was Mr. Jones
your first lover? Think of what you’re about.
Eh?
W.: Y-e—s.
B.: Come, come. You may have blinded other
people ; you’re not going to blind us. Did you
never know a Mr. Smith ?
W.: No.
B.: What I never knew a Mr. Smith ? We all
know Mr. Smiths. Very honourable men, all of
them, and a little partial to the sex. Eh ?
Policeman : Soilence in the Coort I
His Honor : If there’s any more laughing, I’ll
order these people to be removed. Proceed, Mr.
Barrister.
B.: Well, well, Mrs. Jones, we all have skeletons
in our cupboards, and, as there is a Mr. Jones in
the field now, we’ll not ask you to explain any
further on that point. But you swear you saw the
prisoner pass you in the evening. Now, where
were you at the time ?
W.: Standing at the garden gate.
B.: Ha, you arc willing to speak the truth some-
times. We know how you like to spend your
evenings. You have heard the song of “ Over the
garden wall,” eh ? Just so. Now, why Were you
at the gate that evening ?
W,: I was expecting my husband.
B.: Indeed. Well, you swear that it wasn’t an
hour before your husband leaves his office, eh ?
You won’t ? No ? Oh, yes, it was somewhere
about the time. Attend to me, now. Remember
you are on your oath. Was there a Mr. Smith
about ?
W.: No, sir.
B.: What! No Mr. Smith! What is the world
coming to! Why, I can’t go out of the door but I
see a Mr. Smith. Tho town is full of them. The
Court is full of them; and here you tell us that
you, standing for an hour at the garden gate, “ in
the gloaming, in the gloaming,” never saw one.
Crown Prosecutor: I think, your Honor, this ex-
amination is irrelevant.
His Honor; I can’t say till I see what he is want-
ing to bring out.
And so it goes on, and when it is over, it is found
that Mr. Barrister had nothing to bring out, for
he had never heard anything of her past life.
But he has satisfied his own notion of being able,
and has made the yokels call him lively and a
terror for the other side. His hide is too thick to
feel any sympathy for the confusion and pain he
has caused. There is such a thing as carrying
order and decency too far. Order and decency
oblige the sufferers to abide by such protection as
the Court affords. But if the Court will persist in
remaining passive, as it habitually does, and will
only rule the examination irrelevant after the
thorns are all sown, our conception is that when
some husband or brother is brought up for cudgel-
ling the head of the wigged blackguard the pun-
ishment should not go beyond a nominal fine.
An Historical Parallel.
Ninety years have gone by since Bourbon ambi-
tion and rascality resulted in Antoinette’s having
to “bare her fair neck ” to the sharp caress Of
La mere Guillotine, and, up to to-day, the panegy-
rists, through whose servility the curse of heredi.
tary rulers has been imposed upon mankind, have
not ceased to sing the virtues of her and her com-
panions, the ferocity of the sans-culotiea, and the
woes into which popular passion plunged France
and Europe. The sufferings of the canaille, whose
bodies were daily removed in cart-loads from the
ditches of thatVersailles which LeGrandeMonarque
with the concurrence of Holy Church, was raising
to his concubines ; of the thousands forced under
the pressure of the lash to perish of hunger on the
Danube, in quarrels they did not understand, or
rot in the fortresses of him and his successors; of
the miserables found dying of starvation, their
mouths filled with grass and weeds, while courtly
abb6s and long-pedigreed aristocrats drove by in
luxurious carriages; of the proscription to which
the intellect of a great nation was subjected by
ignorant and dissolute nobles—all are forgotten by
those who keep their eyes fixed on the sharp retri-
bution that at last overtook a commonplace
woman and her commonplace husband. Precisely
the same causes that led up to the regime of Marat
and Robespierre in Franco, have for years been
steadily pointing towards a similar result in an-
other great European country. The state of
affairs in Russia, to-day, suggestively resemble g
that in France before the tatterdemalions of Paris
marched on the Bastille, and—
“ Murdered the insolent Governor
For daring to keep them a-waiting.”
The same ominous upheavings under cruel oppres-
sion—the same blind incapacity in the privileged
classes to read the signs of the times. A few
years ago, when a Nihilist bomb demonstrated
that Czar Alexander, despite his claims to be
God’s vicegerent, was constructed on the same
anatomical lines as the meanest of his serfs, the
“ respectability ” of Europe sent up a shrill scream
of abhorrence. Australian conservatism followed
suit, and figuratively shook its fist at the perpetra-
tors of such an unparalleled crime. The fact that
our own Charles was shunted off the track by
means not violently dissimilar, and that to his exe-
cution-mu rder, some still call it—and the dethrone-
ment of his son the best English historians trace
the political liberty of England, was forgotten.
The threats of Russian constitutionalists (for
whom even Lord Roseber y, much to the alarm of
colonial fogeylsm, has a good word to say)
to remove the third Alexander, if their de-
mands for a small modicum of freedom are
not granted, are met with similar cries of
abhorrence by those who —free themselves—should
be the first to recognise the just aspirations of an
oppressed people. But from the fortress of St*
Petersburg, a story now comes to us, which, if
true, should close the mouths of those who coun-
sel “patience” when all that makes life worth
living is wantonly disregarded. It is a story that,
for cynical disregard of human suffering, can only
be equalled by those of the worst days of the
Bourbons. Delicate women are stripped naked,
ravished, fed on putrid food, housed in Kennels
unprovided with the commonest requisites for
decency. Covered with vermin and filth, their
chief occupation is keeping the rats from eating
their dying infants. Men in the prime of life and
vigour, are reduced in a few weeks to skeletons,
cpked with dirt, starved, driven mad by suffering
and solitude, and then knouted when their mania-
cal savings disturb the silence of their living
tomb. Only suppose that the present Czar’s wife
were pulled out of bed by insurgents, treated with
greater indignities than Antoinette, compelled to
sit up o’ nights to keep the rats from her hungry
and ragged children: that her husband, begrimed
with dirt and seamed with thongs, was dragging
out existence in a foul cellar—why half the armies
in Europe would be under orders for the Rus-
sian frontier in a week, and the world would
ring with the cry of outraged humanity.
Responsibility is the natural complement of power
The ruler of the British Empire has no real respon-
sibility-in a political seme—because she has no
real power. Not so with Czar Alexander. He
claims absolute power—not as a legal fiction, but
as a solid fact. Should this atrocious story, then
be true, the responsibility rests on him alone. And
now, you Australian writers who hold that no
abominations justify reprisals, tell us what you
would do if yourselves or your wives or your
daughters were subjected to the treatment de-
scribed by the Paris correspondent of the Times !
It is a statement that has gone forth to the world,
and cannot be met by the “dignified” silence of
even a Casar. Would you still cling to “consti-
tutional ” means, in a country without a constitu-
tion, to meet barbarities that, in the language of
your Bibles, “ cry to Heaven for vengeance ” ? And
should the costly shrine that ignorance is raising
to superstition on the spot where Alexander II.
was murdered, happen to be blown into the air
with dynamite just as his son and Dolgorouka
pass the lintel to pray for their sainted father and
paramour, would you still be disposed to weep for
the Imperial martyr, and call for vengeance on his
assassins? If you would, then you do not believe
in Disraeli when he wrote—
“ Blessed be the hand that dares to wield
The regicidal steel that shall redeem
A nation’s suffering with a tyrant’s blood;”
Nor arc you of the breed that produced the blind
old Puritan who penned —
“ There can be slain
No sacrifice to God more acceptable
Than an unjust and wicked king."
Bless Yon, My People!
It is cheering to read that the Queen (God bless
her!) has summoned Sir Charles Dilke to
Windsor to confer with him upon the condition of
the London poor, it only having now anparcntly
dawned upon Her Majesty that the humbler of
her metropolitan subjects wore not always getting
horse-radish with their roast beef and capers with
their boiled mutton. And it is also still more
cheering (if possible) to learn that in the House of
Lords “ the Prince of Wales spoke in his usual
cheerful manner,” also, upon the same subject.
We hardly know what more the poor of London
can want now. If mere Royal courtesy, such, fpr
instance, as was extended say to the great little
R. B., is “ eminently pleasing” to that gentleman,
who is not poor at all, surely Royal sympathy
ought to be “ pie” to the indigent and starving. It
will be remembered (now for your little lesson in
history) that when the Princess Lamballe was
told the people of Paris were crying for bread, she
said she couldn’t understand them making all that
fuss about bread when you could buy such nice
little brioches for three sous. Well, “ pie,” on the
whole, is nicer than milk rolls, and the London
poor have got it. This should close up the subject
for once and for over. To re-open it, however, for
a moment (we journalists have our trifling privi-
leges!), we may remark that the first great
champion of the poor and destitute in our own
times was Mavhew, who depicted—and backed up
his statements with heart-rending statistics—the
appalling condition of the lower classes of “New
Baoylon,” in his work “London Labour and the
London Poor.” When Dickens was alive, hardly
a week passed but he dragged into the light that
terrible subject which it seems to be the mission
of so many to hide, with a masterly hand he
depicted their trials and their sufferings ; with a
bitter satire he lashed the bogus philanthropists
which spring up like toadstools in every com-
munity. In “ The Chimes ” he is at his best, when
Sir Joseph Bowley bids a posse of destitute «nd
starving labourers to attend and receive moral
instruction at the conclusion of his banquet, and
in the midst of the proceedings Will Fern forces
his way in and addresses the company. Will was
a labourer, who had been starved out of the coun-
try into London, and starved out of London into
the country again. Hear him Gentlefolks,
I’ve lived many a year in this place. You may see
the cottage from the sunkfence yonder. I’ve seen
the ladies draw it in their books a hundred times.
It looks well in a picter, I’ve heerd say ; but
there ain’t weather in picters, and may be ’tis
fitter for that than for a place to live in. Well ! 1
lived there. How hard, how bitter hard I lived
there I won’t say. Any day in the year, and every
day, you can judge for yourselves
I dragged on somehow. Neither me nor any other
man knows how; but so heavy that I couldn't put
a cheerful face upon it, or make believe I was any-
thing but what I was. . . . Now, gentlemen, see
how your laws are made to trap and hunt us when
we’re brought to this. I tries to live elsewhere.
And I’m a vagabond. To jail with him. I comes
back here, and goes a nutting in your woods To
jail with him. I cuts a stick To jail with him. I
eats a turnip. To jail with him. . . . Give us,
in mercy, better homes when we lie in our
cradles; give us better food when we’re working
for our lives.” The chief living champion of the
poor now is G. R. Sims, who first by sketches in
the Weekly Dispatch, later by his “ Dagonet
Ballads,” and now by his articles (illustrated bv
G. Barnard) in the Pictorial World, has ven-
tilated the subject in a startling manner. These
attempts to ameliorate the lot rf the poor have
been going on for years; and it is both satisfactory
and interesting to find that Her Ma jesty has sent
for Sir Charles Dilke to have a chat with him
upon the matter, and that the Prince of Wales
(long may he reign! > “ spoke in his usual cheerful
manner about the poor, in the House of Lords.’ 1

JJ E R SPEECH RESTORED.
Clair View, Inverell, December 10, 1883.
Messrs. Publishers Bulletix.
Dear Sirs.—I beg to acquaint you of a marvellous
cure following on the use of St. Jacobs Oil, which
has taken place in my own family. 1 am a poor
man with eight children, and for years have been
a great sufferer from sciatica. My wife was ad-
vised to try St. Jacobs Oii. She procured a bottle,
and I have been using it of late with good results;
but it is of my eldest daughter, 13 years of age,
that I wish to tell you. she retired one night
about four months ago in her usual good health,
but the next morning she could not speak. My
wife took her to Inverell to see Dr. , who said
her throat was ulcerated low down, aud he pre-
scribed cod liver oil and other medicines; and also
advised her to inhale the fumes of Stockholm tar,
saying she might never recover her speech again.
At the expiration of a fortnight, the medicine
having been finished, another visit to the Dr. was
made, who again prescribed for her, but told my
wife he had no hope of her ever being able to
speak again. We began to despair, but the day I
used the oil—about three months after she was
taken ill—I persuaded my wife, after we had
retired, to use the oil. She got up and
gave the girl two drops in water, and rubbed
it on her throat. Next morning we were
delighted to find that she could talk as well as ever,
and has been able to do so ever since.
1 remain, Gentlemen, gratefully yours,
JAS. R. HATCHER.
FACT AND FANCY FOCUSED.
How paltry and insignificant do our own
jittle snake yarns appear after reading the report
in the Official Gazette of India, informing us
that 19.519 human beings were hurriedly removed
from that country by snake-bite during 1882. In
addition to that, some 3800 of our ftllow-men (black
mostly) were devoured by tigers, leopards, wolves,
alligators, &c. There’s nothing like “big game’
for keeping down the surplus population of a
country From Herberton we hear of a “ peculiar
swamp animal ” there who edits a paper devoted
to the interest of “ tin.” It is whispered that some
of the smart people that way who extracted 200
votes from 17 electors may get Government en-
gagements at nominal wages. Bad to be on the
losing side even in Queensland politics. Oh,
and it is there the “ champion sculler of England ”
lives under an alias. He is also under a cloud.
The champion liar is also there, together with the
“boss ” loafer who is a “squire ” by Act of Parli-
ment. The wives of the lucky diggers are gradu-
ally leaving the wash-tub and the mangle and
going in for “cultcha.” Pianos are getting as
common as perriwinkles, and flash horses as
C.M G’s. The quondam cook to a road-party has
the best tin lode. Some new J.P.'s have been made,
who wear “ masher ” hats and keep the lower order
who have not “struck tin ” at a disdainful distance.
John Moffatt, the maker of Herberton, just re.
turned from “ Yurrup.” Said to have a quarter
of a million at his back At Bourke a snake got
into a cradle and bit a child. Child progressing—
snake decomposing Squeamishness is now
carried to such an extent in Melbourne that pro-
perly clothed bathers are prevented from swimming
i n the Yarra. Dreadfully moral place
tliat! One thing you never find in
Chinese literature—a proverb or an
ordinance against story-telling. The
result is that, when lying is on the
carpet, the most accomplished Euro-
pean has to stand aside. Of course,
there are exceptions. We know a case,
for instance, where —but enough —
Burrowa can show a grape vine 11
years old, 100 feet long, and over 500
bunches of grapes clinging to it....
Here we are again. Charges of in-
delicacy have been preferred against
the pastor of a Free Presbyterian
Church in the Murtoa district, by
two married women, members of
the church. Church committee now
taking evidence, which, rumour says,
is “extremely edifying.”.. .18,000 acres
of grass have been destroyed by bush
fires on the Kerabury—Wagga district
—run alone Moses complains of the
brusque reception he received from
a distinguished Government official
into whose snug Bridge-street sanc-
tum he had forced his way, after many
unsuccessful trials. But Moses should
know that in N.S. Wales, as in other
places, the post of a public servant
carries with it the right of bullying
the long-suffering public that pays
him his screw... .Queenslander resides
at Manly, and says that in all his
wanderings about the colonies he
has come across no place where the
police supervision is so effective. This
he attributes to the officer in charge
there, and considers that the “ larri-
kin” nuisance could be kept down
effectually in other places if the
police were equally vigilant —Major
Barker (Salvation Army) says that
when he started business in Mel-
bourne, a year ago, he “ had no
friend butyeaus.” He doesn't say
if the friendship continues On
motion of Mr. John Davies, C.M.G.,
the children of the Eandwick Asylum
thanked the Mayoress for distri-
buting books. There is no truth in
the report that Mrs. Hardie asked
Mr. Davies to write the date of pre-
sentation (31st January) in the fly-
leaves The cricket match, Austra-
lian Eleven v. eighteen of Newcastle,
excited very little interest outside
the city of black diamonds, and ended
on Saturday last in a draw in favour
of the Eleven.
A little excitement has been caused in
Macquarie-street, and also at Glebe Point, owing
to the disappearance of a youth from the former
locality, and of a maid from the latter. It appears
the friends of neither would consent to their be-
ing the knot, and consequently they fled.
So it seems that the reason why the monu-
ment over the grave of the late Hon. Mr. Fitz-
patrick was left unfinished was that there was not
“perfect unanimity as to the wording of the
inscription.” If some of our living politicians
had happened to die instead of Mr. Fitzpatrick,
there would be no lack of unanimity as to what
should be graven on their monuments. It would
be “ Here lies.” Nothing more. Think this out.
It is remarked by nearly every visitor to
Sydney that there is probably no other city in the
world which is carrying out such building opera-
tions as are here in fufl swing. The big mercan-
tile cities of the old world havw long since reached
their full dimensions; aud with regard to colonial
cities the natural growth, as eviaenced by archi-
tectural improvements, is at the present period
decidedly slow. In Sydney, however, for the last
ten years there has hardly been 100 yards clear of
aoy thoroughfare that has not been occupied with
the building contractor’s material, scaffolding,
*fcc. Here is a short statement of work under-
taken by one contractor during the last two
years. First comes Tattersall's four-storey colos-
sal stables; then Messrs. Young and Lark’s exten-
sive warehouses, near City Bank; Prince, Ogg, and
Co.’s warehouses, George and Pitt streets; Messrs.
Farmer and Co.’s great warehouses, Market aud
Pitt streets; the A.S.N. Co.’s stores and ware-
houses, Circular Quay (1)4 acres of floor space),
and the Government stores and sheds at Eveleigh
—representing in cash just a trifle over £ 190,01)0.
These edifices will compare with any build-
mgs of the kind in any other city in the
world. The whole work was executed by Mr. W.
H. Jennings, who has also done himself infinite
credit by the systematic style in which he has
executed his work—not a single hitch having
occurred in any of the contracts with regard to
labour or material. To the Arms who have under-
taken these great improvements every credit and
success are likewise due for their enterprise and
attachment to the city where they amassed their
wealth.
We have seen several paragraphs in the
papers of late, concerning lady shooters in the
country. Some of them are said to be dead shots.
They can shoot anything that flics. Ladies in
town are quite as accomplished, though in a some-
what different way. They can hit their husbands
with a flat-iron five times out of six. And they
never puton airs about it either.
Some men, while digging a well at Lismore,
found a gold watch-chain at a depth of over ten
feet from the surface. Somebody had evidently
salted that spot with the intention of floating it as
a jewellery-mine. Or, perhaps, what they found
was portion of a chain worn by a prehistoric
Mayor. But, on reflection, prehistoric Mayors did
not wear chains—except prior to their term of
office, when they occasionally wore them on their
legs.
The pantomimes are succeeding better in
Melbourne than was anticipated on Boxing night.
Mrs. G. W. B. Lewis, after risking an absence Of
three years from the stage, has leaped into her old
popularity in the “ Forty Thieves.” The piece is
nearly a quarter of a century old, as far as Mel-
bourne spectators are concerned, but still a lull
house comes out to see it. The scenic effects are
very tine, the ladies are nearly all pretty, and the
Home of the Angels, where the dear things
languidly stretch, is just what the disturbed spirit
likes to be introduced to.
At the Opera House, “ The Sunny South,”
with its bushrangei’s and bobbies, its staunch
digger-men and maidens all forlorn, has given
place to “ Back from the Grave.” There are but a
few nights left for this thrilling “spiritualistic
drama,” with its vows, abductions, murders,
trances, and return from that country from whose
bourne, &c., as the Ma.jeronis open on Saturday
night with “Jealousy.” George goes to New-
castle, to show the people there how, even on the
stage, vice always sneaks meanly away when
virtue turns the corner. Bon voyage.
“Aladdin” holds the Royal, aud Mis*
Maggie Moore has been bribed by a big considera-
tion to show her pleasant happy face, and do
some, capital singing and dancing. Mr. Finn
gave his pen to the enlivening of this venerable
old play, and his local hits were often lucky. Bn*
at the Princess’ a drama was also started, and is
running under tangible encouragement. It is a
tive-act production called “ Impulse.” It is a
translation from the'French, and not as usual, the
dialogue sparkles and th« workmanship is finished.
There is an elopement in it, and a Frenchman can
always screw humour out of that idea. Mr.
Titheradge, who won honours in the “ Silver
King,” climbs higher still as Captain Crichton in
this play. In the other houses the bills of fare arc
attractive. Professor Anderson, something to the
Great Wizard, is startling the people in the Victoria
Hall. Aud Miss Melville is on her way to Sand-
hurst to make the people of that mining centre
happy at heart.
The sad plight of certain Victorian civil
servants calls for heartfelt sympathy. A splendid
proficiency in the art of how not to do it” has
enabled the gentlemen whose arduous duties are
devoted to the service of the Titles Office to get
into arrears with their work. And now—get your
handkerchiefs ready—the examiners have been
instructed to be on duty from 9 a.m. to 5 p.m. to
make up the ground so cleverly lost. The tear
stands gently in our eye as we think of these civil
gentlemen—the very bone and sinew of the colony
—slaving away for eight long weary hours; and
we do trust they have a good interval for luncheon.
Ou'- only consolation is that these Herculean
efforts will not have to be kept on long, as the
Attorney-General anticipates that the Titles Office
will be brought into a thoroughly satisfactory
working state shortly.—
THE EIGHT-HOUR MOVEMENT.
The clerks in the Titles are burdened with care
(We fear that they cannot survive),
Since they have to keep yawning and combing their
hair
From nine in the morning till five.
Such dull dreary drudgery, day after day,
Is plainly too much for their powers;
For, with hands in their pockets, they drearily say
“By Jingo, what awful long hours!”
Field-Marshal the Prince of Wales, in his
full uniform, as he appeared leading the British
army to victory on Clapham Common, is the
subject of a splendid oil painting to be sold, with
other works of art, by Bradley, Newton, and

Tue Diamond Dyes are the best dyes made.
Have you tried them? If not, then you should do
so. They are the best, and, at the same time, the
cheapest dyes in this market. Why ? Because
they are true to colour every time, andean always
be depended on to produce the desired effect. One
package will dye from three to four times more
than any other dyes sold. All dealers sell them, or
will get them for you. Insist on having them, and
take no others. All sold at one price; (Id. only.

Mr. Alberto E. Geismardo, a professional
glove fitter from the Bon Marche, Paris, has ar-
rived in Sydney under engagement to Mr. Cater,
193 and 195 Pitt-street. We believe that Mr. Geis-
mardo is the first of his profession to find his way
to Australia. With the possible exception of tight
boots there are, probably, no articles that have
caused so much domestic infelicity as bad or Ill-
fitting gloves. It is Mr. Gelsmardo's province to
remove this dllficulty. and, by doing so, to restore
that equanimity so apt to be lost when your gloves
are puckered at the back or shaky about the
seams.*
The editor of a New Caledonian paper
states that he is going to write strong articles
This reminds us. The strongest articles we have
ever seen were in the Evening News. They were
wrapped round Wollongong cheese.
A number of members of the Ministry
went on board the Italian ship Caracciolo last
week, to say good-bye to Captain de Amezaga.
Captain de Amezaga keeps a very choice brand of
champagne on board. But this merely by the way.
The Mudgee correspondent of the Nooze
says that the population of Mudgee is being added
to by the arrival of strangers. Ho is at a loss to
account for this. Wo are not. They go there
because they are strangers. No one who knew
the place would ever go there —except, perhaps, in
a prison-van.
A correspondent of the Evening News
writes all the way from Casino to inform that
brilliant Journal that “another year has rolled
round.” This person is evidently under the im-
pression that the late deceased year was all its time
in ajstate or Intoxication. But, perhaps, ho has his
reasons for thinking so.
Parnellites s»em determined to muster
stronaly in the House of Commons, but they must
be stumped for candidates when they have to send
to N. S. Wales for one, as they did by the last
mail. One of the agreements made while the
patriots were in gaol was to the effect that other
things being equal a “ suspect" was to have the
first offer of a constituency before all other
eligible persons.
The secretary to our Court at the late
Fisheries Exhibition, hold in London, is a man
with a quaint little humour of his own. He makes
several suggestions to Sir Saul Samuel as to what
should be done with the exhibits. This is one of
the suggestions:-“That the tinned fish for food
be distributed amongst those of the commissioners
and members of the Press who may bo desirous of
testing thefr excellence.” Who may be desirousi
This is cutting sarcasm. Still, the proposal is a
good-natured one, and shows that Mr. Ramsay —
that is his name—has a heart to feel for the strug-
gling literary man. His memory should be kept
green in—the Noos office, anyhow.
The Sydney Gymnasium was
pretty well filled on Monday evening,
on the occasion of a benefit tendered
to “Professor” D’Harcourt, who has
been laid up for some ivoeks with a
broken ankle. The “Professor,” who
looked interesting with a conspicuous
bandage round the damaged limb, did
s°me very pretty work with the light
clubs, to waltz time by the band; and,
assisted by Messrs. Turnbull, Fry,
Stevenson, Dawes, and others, some
very good work was gone through on
the rings, parallel and horizontal bars,
the light weights Fry and Dawes show-
ing up to advantage in these exercises.
Some heavy weight lifting was shown
by the men of muscle, Mr. Turnbull
putting a bell, weighing something
over 701b., from the floor to arm’s
length above his head no less than 23
times. “Professor” Miller then
showed off his massive physique to
advantage in some heavy club swing-
ing ; two amateurs showed a set-to
with the mittens, a shade above the
general average; D’Harcourt and
Mr. Bclisario went through a lady-
like performance with the gloves ;
and Messrs. Turnbull and “ Young ’
Miller, in a friendly way, showed a
few wrestling holds, or “holts,” as
an Italian gentleman alongside of us
would insist on calling them. The
benefldare then thanked the company
for their attendance.
Things are slightly unsettled in
the house of John M’Kenna, of Green-
vale, Wilcannia. It appears that, in
October last, he took to himself a
wife, and shortly afterwards he took
to the innocent but rather tiring
amusement of kicking his spouse
round the yard and anointing her
back with stirrup oil. On New Year's
night, John came home a trifle corned,
and found one Steve Newberry sitting
with Mrs. Mac. Not approving of
this, John poked his finger in his wife’s
eye and knocked her down The gal-
lant Don Juan Newberry, not caring
to interfere in that part of Mr.MTten-
na’s marital duties, at once cleared,
and hid himself up a hollow log. Mr.
MVKenna then throw a kettle full of
scalding water over his wife’s head
and face. Hearing her screams, the
bold Newberry rushed up, and was
about to quote the Herald, and say
such conduct was most unseemly,
when M’Keuna produced a butcher’s
knife and playfully asked Stephen
where he’d like to have it. Not being
prepared to answer .iust then, the gay
lover once more skeddadled to think
the matter over, and has not since
been heard of. One James Burrow,
however, made himself horrlly offi-
cious, and threw M’Kenna over his
own fence. And, next May, our Wil-
cannia Othello will call round and
unfold his plain, unvarnished tale
before the most potent, grave, and
reverend seignor who presides at the
Quarter Sessions,
Half the public men in Melbourne are
packing up for a visit to “Yurrup.” Johnny
MTntyre, Paterson, and a lot more are either gone
or going. Of course, the usual before they
start, and equally of course the rivers of hogs’
wash that wells from them at the banquets like
water from the rock when struck by the rod of
Moses. The last public man to give his views on
things in general, before taking a trip home, was
Mr. Joseph Thompson. He was banqueted at the
Athenmum, and made some remarks lust as sensi-
ble as if he’d been in the House all his life instead
of hawking fish and book-making.

Tho Yankees have still another best on
record to their credit:-The quickest divorce time
on record was made in Chicago, III, Nov. 7. Mrs.
Lulu Scanned! tiled a petition for divorce from
Burt H. Scannoll at 9.45 a.m. At the same time th“
defendant waived all service, summons, notice
and other formula. At 10 o’clock the case was
J before Judge Smith. At 10.25 the decree was
granted. Tho entire transaction occupied forty
minutes. Smart work, this.
Last Saturday week an amusing cricket
mateh was played at Albury, between the local
Methusalems and the “old buffers” of Beech-
worth; the Albury ante hluvians winning by 15
runs. There was no gammon about the style
Beech worth Gamjnon played, for he scored 30
runs, and bowled 9 wickets. On the Albury side,
old man Frew made 31 runs and n)d Buffer Billson
lowered the timbers of nine of the Beechworth
veterans. There were 16 players on each side, and
of course, the majority of them fought at
Waterloo.
Clarence Whistler, whose collar-bone was
stated to have been fractured in his recent wrest-
ling contest with William Muldoon, was tendered
a benefit at Recreation Park, San Francisco, Cal.,
Nov. 4. About twelve hundred persons were pre-
sent, and the entertainment, consisting of boxing
and wrestling, afforded s itisfaction. Whistler was
present, his arm in a sli»g, and Muldoon offered to
wrestle anyone and give £20 to whoever could
throw him—an offer that no one accepted. By the
way, the Miller-Muldoon affair seems to have died
a natural death.
A varied and lengthy programme of sports
was recently gone through at the Blind College,
Worcester, Eng, The running of the blind stu-
dents was directed by the ringing of bells, and
aided by stationing boys at eath post of the roped
centre. Two of the blind students took their
“high leap” standing; a third, tho winner, care-
fully measured his distance backward from the
bar, then sprang forward and cleared it. Tho
blind boys In a 100 yards’ handicap ran in a
“straight” manner, which is more than some of
the peds. with good eyesight do.
The Waitangi, Sirocco, Guinevere, Daphne,
Pleiades, and Sao started on Saturday last for the
handicap race for prizes given by Mr. W. O. Gil-
christ, Commodore Knox, and the club, in connec-
tion with the Royal Sydney Yacht Squadron. The
handicaps were:—Waitangi scratch, Sirocco
scratch, Guinevere 9 minutes. Daphne 12 minutes,
Pleiades 12 minutes, Sao 13 minutes, and the
yachts finished as follows: Waitanga. 3h. 5min.
lOsec.; Sirocco, 3h. 16mln. 25sec.; Guinevere, 3h.
18min. lOsec.; and the Sao, 3h. 26min. 45sec, So the
Waitangi appropriated first prize, the Sirocco
second and the Sao third.
The English Rugby football season is
proving very rough. At the Oxford University
football matches ou Saturday, several serious
accidents occurr ed. Mr. Gore received serious in-
juries, but is progressing favourably. Fowler, of
Magdalen, sustained a fracture of one of his legs.
At Cambridge, in the Rugby match between Uni-
versity and Kensington, Colbourn Hope broke his
leg, and another Cantab was very much hurt.
One of the Kensington men had his nose smashed,
and another severely sprained his ankle. Most of
the players received slight injuries, and minor
casualties occurred in other games.
Hanlan and Stevenson gave an exhibition
row at Vallejo, Cal., on Thanksgiving Dav, for
which they are stated to have received £130 and
£20 respectively. With respect to Teemer’s chal-
lenge to the champion, it is stated to have been
the outcome of a discussion between the former
and a Chicago sporting man, during which the
latter offered to wager £10 that the M’Keesporter
would not issue a challenge to tho champion.
Hanlan is getting quite a versatile sport. He was
to run bruiser Sullivan 100 yards in San Francisco;
and, in conjunction with Muldoon, tho wrestler, ho
appeared at the California Theatre on the night of
December 10, in statuary posing.
Master Walter Jeyes, of Northampton,
Eng., born August 12,1872, on November 10 under-
took, for a wager of £10, to run nine miles in an
hour at the Victoria Running Grounds. Kitteriog,
Eng. He ran his first mile in 6min., and he con-
tinued to knockoff mile after mile at a v ’ace which
surprised all present. At the half hour it was
found he had covered nearly t "o laps more than
his required distance, but at this part of the race
the wind, which was biowiug freely at the start,
became almost boisterous, and, although the lad
persevered pluckily, ho failed by 350 yards. Tho
track, which was but 183 yards In circumference,
was against the performance of the task.
Members of the M.R.C. mustered strongly
at the Oxford on Thursday night: Mr. Vice-Presi-
dent Carl Sahl in the chair. A most satisfactory
report was presented, and the following officers
were elected for this year:—President, Hon. J. B.
Watt, M.L.C.; vice-presidents, Messrs R. Fowler,
J. B. Holdsworth, C. L. Sabi, C. K. Moore, Hon. W,
H. Alderson, M.L.C.; captain, Henry Earle Wilkin-
son; hon. treasurer, Robert A. Keddie; hon.secre-
tary, John Blackman; match and selection com-
mittee, Messrs. Wilkinson, W, G. Brett, and Fitz-
gerald; committee, Messrs. R. N. Bull, F. J. Bull,

The Canterbury Park Race Club had fine
weather, and an attendance of some 3509, for their
inaugural meeting on Saturday last, and every-
thing passed off happy ns the proverbial marriage
bell. Boniface appropriated the opening Handi-
cap by three lengths from Bellman, Uhlan third.
The Midsummer Stakes fell a rather easy victory
to Regulator, Mare second, Combadello third.
Polestar defeated Tait by throe lengths for the
Park Handicap. Fritz won the Sellinsr Race, and
was afterwards knocked down for £85. And the
day's sport concluded with the Visitor!' Handicap,
which ro#ultod in a win for Talt, after a great
struggle up the straight, Roduette, a snort head
away, second, and Hypatia third.
Recently a pt‘i!e light took place at 8«n

light-weight boXer, of California, and a pugilist
named Scott. Manyard weighed Hist., »nd t-cott
13st. The latter was bacadd to knock Man-
yard out of time in foUr rounds* bUt the ehatnplon
proved an easy Victor. Manyard is an old N.Z.
colonist. His real name Is vvilllairt Wmcllcourt.
In the early days of the Thames goldfield he earned
a living by peddling vegetables, and was known
among the diggers by the 4oiibri4'Mtt of “Cabbage
Bill,” ; now he is a tip-top swell - an artist in noses
—and qualified to keep company with Lord Hcres-
ford, tne Prince of Wales, Spurgeon, and other

In reply to “ Professor” Miller’s challenge,
Sullivan says be has no intention of Journeying to
the Antipodes on the terms proposed by Miller,
but he win give Miller £300 to meet him in a glove-
contest in San Francisco or New York City ; the
winner to have the entire receipts of the house,
and if Miller stays four rounds, Marquis or
Queonsb,* rry rules, he is to be declared the winner
of the c.mtest. This should sun Miller, and if the
“ Professor " dors not close with the otfer at once,
he ought to cry i>eccavi, and give over fighting the
Yankee la the newspapers. Sullivan and Ryan
have been matched to spar, in San Francisco, four
rounds, each of three minutes duration, with one-
miuute rest, and a man down to get upon his feet
again, unassisted, in ten seconds, between January
33 and February 33.
Little Martin, the innocent child who won
the Czarowitch Stakes at Newmarket, and who was
described by the gushers as being better pleased
with the six-bladed knife his generous uncle gave
him than ho was with the £1000 cheque, is gradu-
ally waking up to a due seme of his own import-
ance, Ho now doclines to ride for any great race
unless he receives £50 for a losing mount, and
£1000 if he wins. The consequence is that many
other feather-weights are following his pernicious
example, and owners and trainers are petitioning
the Kngiish Jockey Club to raise the standard
weights in handicaps, so that their horses may be
ridden by competent, fair-dealing men, instead of
cheeky brats, who are wholly incapable of keeping
a horse straight, or of getting anything like a good
result out of him.
In London, Goode and Roberts fought
with gloves before a “select party,” in a club
room up Hackney way. Goode is a youngster
only rising twenty, stood a couple of inches over,
and soiled some 71b. more, than Roberts. The
men fought in a 13-foot ring, and it was thought
Roberts’ experience would more than make up
for his phy. ical deficiencies. Such did not prove
the case, however, as Goode took a decided lead in
the fifth round, which he held till the eighth, when
the gas was extinguished at the meter. Goode's
papa, who seconded his son, would not give over
the contest, but obtained alighted candle, from
which dull light the fight was continued for
another round, when pioceedings were brought
to a termination by the candle being knocked out
of Goode, senior’s, hand. The men boxed 33min.
33sec.
In commenting on “Professor” Miller’s
challenge to John L. Sullivan, the N. Y. Clipper
states thatthe match ought to Justsuit the Yankee
bruiser, as it is understood he contemplates a visit
to Australia. And, while on the bruising racket,
we may state that Mace has been on the “bluff”
in England. In the Sporting Life, Alf. Green-
field (who affixes “Champion” to his signature)
Hies into print, stating that he had journeyed to
Manchester to make a match with Mace's
Jack Davis, but was informed by the Gipsy that
he was too late, as a match had been made with
Bill England. Such was not the case, however, as
Enfland had withdrawn his deposit, there being
no prospect of effecting a match with Davis This
sort of business cannot do Mace and Davis much
Sood in their advertised sparring tour through
reat Britain and the Continent.
George Ellis has the Dreamland in hand
for repairs, and. to took at the damage, we cannot
understand how she could possibly have been the
overtaking boat in the collision with the Glenelg.
She has a hole in her, pretty well big enough to
allow the Hon. John, M.L.C., to crawl throuah,
and she is cut clean down to the keoi. The only
amusing Incident in connection with the ,iad affair
was given us by “Bi»” Green, who formed one of
the crew. He told us thatdirectly the boat was cut
down, and he found himself tinder water, “ he
doived up to the surface.” Ellis has just turned
out a3(-teet half-decker to th‘ order of Mr. Tids-
well, a counterpart of the Wingadee. The 30-feet
half-deckers are getting very popular in the har-
bour, and justly so, as they are a very handy class
of boat; and when a 30 footer has to stay at home.
It is time for eveu the 34-footers to pick up their
moorings.
Lord Rosebery’s worst racing specula-
tion was made shortly after his marriage with his
wealthy wife. A horse called Bonnie Scotland,
belonging to Robert Peck, the trainer, was, at the
eleventh hour, rushed into the posilion of first
favourite for the Derby, and his lordship, in his
anxiety to secure the Blue hibaud of the turf,
offered six thousand pounds for this equine trea-
sure on the morning of the race. Strange to sav,
tne offer was accepted. Bonnie Scotland came in
with the crowd on that occasion, and, as the horse
displayed the same sociability of character in suc-
ceeding efforts. Lord Rosebery sold it in disgust.
In a general way, however, our late noble visitor
is credited with knowing how many beaus m .tke
live in racing matters. By the way, it isn't every
sporting writer who understands the appropriate-
ness of Lord R.’s colours—“ primrose mid ross
hoops.” His title and his family name—Primrose
—suggested the dainty combination.
We commend this par. specially to the
notice of the New South Wales Rowing Associa-
tion. The Victorian Association has already turned
iis attention to the intercolonial eight-oar race,
which has been fixed for the 5th April next. Mr.
Booth has been chosen as stroke, with power to
select one of his crew, and these two, with Mr. G.
Upward as representative of the Association, will
form the selection committee. If the N.S. Wales
Association does not take the matter in hand im-
mediately after Anniversary Regatta, it would be
better to let the race lapse than start a crew
patched up at the last moment. Should they bo
willing to row. Messrs. Brett, Brodie, Gadcn, Web-
ster, Jobnson, Seale, and the Bros brothers would
form the best crew seen on our waters for years
past. Surely the M.R.C. men will not allow theT
difference with the Association to prevent their
rowing in an intercolonial race!
Our tall friend Edwards, the pedestrian,
has been having troublous times in New Zealand.
At Auckland he was sued bv J. H. Pollock,
butcher, of Wellington, for £50, alleged to have
been lost by the plaintiff acting as guarantor for
Kd wards when the latter had a hotel in Wanganui,
Edwards repudiated the debt, and said thatthe
blank cheque produced with his signature to it
was a forgery. His Worship nonsuited plaintiff
with costs, remarking that the whole thing was
unsatisfactory. But the case did not end here, as
lie was charged on the following day with perjury,
by swearing that his signature to the cheque was
a forgery. It was stated that the warrant had
been issued in Wellington for his arrest, but the
Court deeded, in the absence of a warrant, that
they could no*, take action on a telegram, and dis-
missed the case. Edwards did not wait for the
warrant, but started the same afternoon for
’Frisco.
Since the last ’Frisco mail the record for
trotting with running mate has been still further
reduced, in a match between H. B. Winship and
Frank, with running mates. For the first heat
Winship led at the Quarter-pole by a length, and
he rem lined that far in front till approaching* the
three-quarter pole, where he broke badly, and was
headed instantly. He was quickly brought to a
trot again, but, lie could not overcome the lead
obtained by Frank, who, coming down the stretch
at a tremendously fast pace, passed under the
wire first by half a length, in the unparalleled
time of just two dttd a quarter seconds
faster than the previous best* It was then too dark
to riontinue the face, and the heats were postponed
till the following day, when the sport Was Jloofi

Suggested by an Incident that occurred the other
day in a cricket match, between a team of Govern-
ment men and an eleven of country visitors, In
which the former, seeing that they stood a good
show of getting an awful licking, instead of, like
men, trying to retrieve their luck in the second
innings, picked a quarrel upon a very paltry pre-
tence with their visitors, and, refusing to take
their innings, left the field like veritable “cock-
tails.” Surely it is the worst of very bad form for
a party of men, when, seeing that the day is going
against them, to at once “jack” and sulk like a
lot of kids, and to go to and fro talking about
“smacking,” “punching,” &c., &c., to people
whom they should have looked upon, for the time
at least, as their guests.
The entries for the Anniversary Regatta
closed on Saturday night. A crew each from the
Sydney and Mercantile Rowing Clubs have entered
for the senior fours. The 22-ft. open boat race
will be a match between the Rosetta and St. Crispin.
The Lucia, Nereus, and Desdemona are going for
the 19-ft. skiff race. The Guinevere, Sirocco, and
Waitanga will put in an appeaaance for the 10-ton
and upwards yacht handicap. Beach, Messenger,
Trickett, Clifford, and Pearce are going for the
champion race. The Doris, Australian, Pleiades,
and Sao are entered for the under 10 tons yacht
handicap. For the Laidley Sculls, Middleton,
Thompson, and Dobson will represent the senior
club, and Brett, Tremble, and Ives the Mercantile
K.C. The Carlotta, Victor, Lottie, Bronte, and
Adel phi are down for the 24-ft. race. No less than
eleven entries have been received for the half-
decker handicap. Messenger and Pearce only
come forward for the all-comers’ light skiff handi-
cap. The school race fell through, and the minor
races filled up in good style.
From America we hear that Mr. F. P.
Murray, the amateur walker, who recently
covered a mile in 6 min. 29 3-5 sec., thus beating
Merrill’s record, walked three miles in 21 min. 9 1-5
sec. on Novembers. The occasion was in a Mile
Handicap at the Manhattan A.C.’s Annual Election
Day Games. He could probably have won this
race, but L. E Meyers, “the record breaker,”
offered him a modal to go on and beat the three
miles record. This he was more anxious to do
than win the race, and he did not walk himself out
at the shorter distance. He was, however, close
close up to the first and second, making the mile
in (i min. 39 4-5 sec. He then continued on with T.
F. Delaney, the new cross-country champion,
jogging by his side, and the times he made were as
follows:—One and a half miles, lb min. 19 2-5 sec. ;
two miles, 13 min. 59 sec.; two and a half miles.
17 min. 40 2-5sec.; three miles, 21 min. 91-5 sec The
best previous amateur record was 21 min. 28 see.,
made by H. Webster, in England, in 1880. and the
American amateur record was 21 min. 42sec., by
Harry Armstrong, made in 1878.

The National Regatta Committee have
restricted the race for 24-feet open boats to ama-
teur crews. This race, sailed as it used to be by
professionals, was always looked upon as the sail-
ing race of the day and as a rule the best boat
won ; but with amateur crews, in nine cases out
of ten, it is the crew and not the boat that wins
the race. Goodness knows, the amateurs have
races out of number to sail for during the season,
and we certainly think at our National Regatta
the boats should be sailed without any restriction
us to crews. In the old days, with such men at the
tiller as poor George Montgomery, Ellis, Cole-
brook, Fletcher, &c., it was indeed a treat to see
the manner in which the boats were handled, and
every inch taken out of them, but unfortunately
among the amateurs the best boats are in the worst
hands. Take, for instance, the Victor, by far
the fastest twenty-four footer in commission.
Tt has been enough to make the lover of a fast
boat heartsick to see the way she has been mur-
dered during the past season with an amateur
crew, while we guarantee with a good man at the
tiller, she would have carried everything before
her. The result of the restriction of crews will
end in the extinction of t*?e professional open-
boat sailer, a result that must be looked upon
with regret by Boating men who remember the
exciting 24-ft. matches in years gone by. We are
beginning to think first-class open-boat sailing re-
ceived a death shock when Mr. Hyam retired.
Count F. de Lagrange who for more than
a score of years has been in the foremost rank of
the owners and breeders of thorough-bred horses
in France and England, died on Nov, 22, of gout,
aged sixty-seven years. His breeding establish-
ment was the largest in France, even at the period
of his death, notwithstanding the large inroads
made upon the stock, by the sales of broodmares,
which have taken place there within the past two
or three years, and the many fast racers owned bv
him have frequently carried his colours—blue, red
sleeves and cap—first past the winning post.
Among his more notable victories have been the
following: 1858, won the French Derby with Ven-
tre St. Gris : 1859, same race with Black Prince:
1861, same race with Gabri' l d’Estrees and Cam-
bridgeshire with Palestro; 1864, Epsom Oaks with
Fill© de 1’Air; 1865, Epsom Derby, Two Thousand
Guineas, Grand Prix de Paris, and Doncaster St.
Leger with Gladiateur; 1877, Two Thousand
Guineas with Chamant; 1879, St, Leger with
Rayon d’Or; 1883, Criterion Stakes with Archiduc.
The latter was installed a prominent favourite for
the Epsom Derby of 1884: but the Count's death
causes his disqualification, and the many engage-
ments made by the stable in the stakes of the next
two seasons are now void. Included in the list are
sixteen for the Grand Prix of 1884, and twelve for
the same fixture in 1885. Deceased was elected to
the French Assembly from the department of
Gers in 1849 and 1853, and was very popular with
the Government while Louis Napoleon was Em-
peror. His son and nephew will probably continue
the stable.
W. G. George, although he again altered
the amateur record for ten miles on Nov. 17, by
beating his previous fastest, viz.. 52 rain. 56V6 sec ,
by 3Hj sec., did not run up to his trial, which was
stated to be faster than the best on record, and the
times accomplished by Deerfoot, Levitt, and Jack-
son still head the poll. The amateur, however,
had a cold day, and it is possible he may do the
trick on a more favourable opportunity. At all
events we may confidently anticipate a nearer ap-
proach to the professional time at his next essay,
Three days previous L. E. Myers gave an exhibi-
tion half mile at the Pittsburg Athletic Club Meet-
ing, doing the distance in 1 min.56aec. The course
was a lap and a few yards, with long and sharp
corners, and a stifiish breeze prevailed. Myers like-

not to show him up. The circumstances were as
follows:—Baird and four others were engaged in a
half mi!e race, and it was arranged that Smith, the
starter, after having fired the pistol for the race,
was 15sec later to lire another shot as a signal for
Myers. The cartridge for the other runners, how-
ever, proved the last, and when the pistol snapped
the second time and no report followed, Myers,
who had taken one step forward, stepped back and
looked to the starter, who then sent him off by
word of mouth. Once off, Myers wont at such a
pace that at a quarter of a mile he was leading.
He then eased and allowed Baird to come up until
a furlong from home, when he again darted away

PERSONAL ITEMS.
The London Daily News has despatched
Mr. Macdonald to Egypt to discover tidings of
Mr. O’Donovaa, the D.N.’s special correspondent
in the Soudan, whose perilous enterprise has. there
is too much reason to fear, terminated fatally.
Tho Orient s.s. Cuzco landed O’Donovan at Suez,
in July last, and his mission was to make straight
for the False rrophet. The jovial gentleman,
however, expressed a belief to his fellow voyagers
that ho would never get back home again, and it
would seem that his prediction has come off.
A young Englishman of wealth, a masher,
and it is said a poet and athlete, has gone off his
insignificant head over Mary Anderson, and pushes
his passion to the extent of dressing as a trouba-
dour and haunting the stage door with a flute.
When he first weakened, h« never told his love,
but let concealment detain him around tho corner
until Miss Anderson tripped out to her carriage,
when he stepped up and offered her a magnificent
bouquet. She declined it. So now tho perishing
Petrarch simply kneels every night, as the lady
posses out, and pours bis soul In song.
Master Joseph Adams (aged six), of Tum-
barumba, evidently has a destiny: but, unless it
alters its present mode of operations, Master
Joseph is mighty apt to get killed before ho be-
comes a hero. When only a baby he was attacked
by a dog, and had half his face chawed off. A
little later on, a snake was proceeding to evict him
out of his cradle, but bis Pa happened to be on
hand with an axe, and this mad® things sick for
his snakeship. On the 4th instant. Joseph, like his
namesake the Egyptian Premier, fell down a well,
but being speedily fished up and squeez’d out, and
hung across a fence to dry, he soon recovered.
T’his was lucky for Joseph, because it enabled him
to fool round the business end of a pet foal next
day, and thmeby secure a kick on the forehead,
from which it is doubtful if he ever will recover.
Lord Rosebery’s personal appearance
was not (ard we blush as write that last w. rd),
commented unon in particularly admiring terms,
at the Flemington Race Course. A general
remark among men whp remember him
as a youthful sportsman, some twelve or fifteen
years ago, was that his erstwhile “ freshness ” had
been replaced by a sort of pro. like appearance ;
moreover, his lordship cheats tue barber. In tho
old days, when his innocent lookmg face took the
fancy—so said gossip - of the Princess Louis>, the
fortunate Earl used to have hi* hair cut oftenei
than he does now, and looked all tho better for it.
Since he became so thick with the Grand Old Man
he has taken to playing the “ heavy ” role, and
candour compels us to add that "juvenile lead”
fitted him a good deal better. Hut as all this must
be very distressing to some of his worshippers, we
will haste to smooth them down by remarking
that the fair Countess looks not a day older, and if
possible, even more amiable than on the morning
she was married.
J he great Matthew Arnold was a failure
in America, chiefly because people conlin't hear
him when he spoke. Flaneur says that his first ap-
pearance had a pitiable result. He lectured on the
respective claims of literary and scientific educa-
tion, in favour of the former, but seemed to forget
that his splendidly large audience had brains of
their own, had read Tyndall and Spencer as well as
himself, and many held positions in the world of
literature and science O' ly loss eminent than Mr.
Arnold’s own. His physique is opposed to all ideas
of manliness: he is effeminate in aspect, and has a
meaningless stare, weak voice badly managed, and
no idea of elocution. People called "louder” at
the beginning of the evening, but, before the end,
the majority put on their bats and walked home,
regretting the eight shillings they had paid for
scats.
Two more Australian ladies have been
distinguishing themselves by their musical abili-
ties at home. Miss Mitchell is credited with a
voice like Albani’s, a contralto-soprano, and in
florid as well as pathetic compositions gained
great praise. Miss Eva Orris a plants'e who has
been studying under Giovanna Sgambatiat Rome.
On the 24th November she made her public debUt
in Dublin, and the Express said, of her Chopin’s
Polonaise:—“It caused no little excitement
among the audience that such a noble climax,
after so long a crescendo, could be attained—
could grow beneath the hands of the slight,
the fragile, and graceful girl who sat at
the keys on Saturday ; for, In the whole
range of the concert bravura school, there
is not a more physically exacting piece of execu-
tion than this polonaise in A flat. ’ She also played
Beethoven’s sonata in ►* minor, with all the re-
peats, and Chopin’s.Berceuse. Miss Orr, who will
probably return to the colonies, is daughter of an
afliuent squatter who was well known on the
Avoca.
So Jardine Smith has taken wing to the
asphodel meadows! A good man, an ab.e writer,
a generous disputant, and a trusty friend; he was
a partisan, but without bitterne s; his pen stabbed,
but without venom. By temperament he was
happy, and his stars were fairly kind. Many years
ago, somewhere about twenty, he played for a
while with the saltpetre and gun-cotton of social
questions, but he tired of the play and passed over
from Melbourne Punch to a permanent post on
the Anaus. He has been there over a dozen years.
He had not too much ability for a journalist. No
man has. But he was very much above the level
of tho conventional press writer. He whs a littera-
teur by ins'inct. The calls of the daily Press, how-
ever, play havoc with such instincts. He died at
his icsidence in Gore-street, Fltzroy, on the 13th
instant, aged 49 years. We don’t know that any of
hi« brain work can be built up into a monument,
but his life has borne fruit in the clearness with
which many political questions arc seen by the
people of Victoria.
One of the most decidedly dead men
under (his emth to-day is a party by the name of
Morgan. Seldom or never has it fallen to the lot
of any man to he successfully killed three times in
three consecutive days; but this was tho luck of
Morgan. Last Monday week he was tound float-
ing in the Duck River, and, on being hauled out,
it was at once discovered that he was what Mr.
Mantelini would call a “demnition dead body.”
That was death tho first. On Tuesday morning he
was brought by train to Parramafta, and, not-
withstanding the fact that th« police were in-
formed of his arrival, he was allowed to remain
lying in the broiling sun on one of the most con-
spicuous portions of the platform for fully two
hours, with scarcely anything to cover his defence-
less form. The result was that Morgan was fatally
sunstruck, and before help could be obtained he
died once more. One would think his luck might
have given him a rest after that; but it appeals
there was a suspicion still entertained that he was
either “foxing,” to fool the police, or else he had
felonious designs on the wearing apparel and other
moveables of the corpses lodged at Rookwood. So
the authorities shunted the hearse-truck on to the
wrong sot of rails in front of the graveyard gates,
and in another instant a goods train crashed clean
through, and sent poor Morgan s body Hying across
the road. And now he spends all his spare time
wondering whether they’Jl take him up and cre-
mate him.
We are serry to observe, by his last letter
from Portsea prison, that the Claimant is getting
dull. He talks about “Court Favourites,” about
Gladstone “driving the people of England mad, as
he has driven those of Ireland;” of his cousin, bo
says: “ I suppose some of thegreat ones have cut
him from coming tome, hue I should have thought
that, having the Wolsey blood in him, he would
have stood to his colours until death.” He prays
nightly, he says, for the rest of the soul of Guil-
ford Onslow, and is generally a driveller. When
in his splendour, we saw the Claimant often; at
the Junior Gun Club at Hendon, at the Waterloo
Hotel, at tho theatre, his appearance in a box at
which used to stop tho performance for half an
hour or so while the pit and gallery cheered
vociferously. During either of his trials, any
manager would give “ Sir Roger ” £20 for leave to
advertise bis attendance ; but there was always
too much of the grand seigneur (real or assumed)
about him to allow of his taking the money. His
manner, it was generally allowed, was perfect.
His predilection for always dressing in black
was, perhaps, the most trying ordeal, so far as
“ deportment ” is concerned, that he could
have been subjected to; but notwithstanding his
sable garments, his enormous proportions, and a
fondness for anointing his locks with bear's grease,
he held his own with all his associates from a
social point of view, although he numbered
amongst them such distinguished men as Earl
Rivers, with whom, indeed, ho was seen constantly
driving about. The Earl supplied the Claimant all
through, not only with ample funds for the menus
plaisirs, but with a double brougham and a magni-
ficent >air of bay horses. The equipage was
cheered to the echo in whatever part of the city it
was seen, the applause at times not being unmin-
gled with jocose allusions to tho corpulency of the
; occupant, and loud cries of “Wagga Wagga,”
1 “ Bogie.” &c.. were not unfrequently heard «s he
drove by. It is to be regretted that, having
■ formed an intimacy with Sergeant Ballautfne,
the Claimant, even before Lady Tichborne’s death,
i commenced to develop proclivities of a decidedly
giddy nature —a circumstance which induced him to
rusticate the Missus and to commence a course of
study of English upeia Bouffe under the auspices
of a lady named Ro-e Bell. But though he sinned
much against the ethics of morality, &c,, he gained
universal admiration for one thing -Roger kept
his nerve throughout, even when the wretched
defence offered by Dr. Kenealy became wilder and
wilder, and no hope remained but in a disagree-
ment of the jury. Stolid, sphinx-like, and phlegm-
atic, he was immovable to the the last, and when
the sentence was about to bo pronounced no one
could detect even the twitching of an eyebrow.
When the jury were about to come in, we remem-
ber, he merely took off his watch and drain and
banded them to young Bog c, and nodded, with a
halt smile to the reporters, with whom ho had
grown, during the many months of his trial, to be
well acquainted. He will bo out in less than a
year, and is to be well looked after. His wife is
still In the workhhouse at Stoneham.
Far back in the sixties, Thomas De Lacy
Moffat was Colonial Treasurer of Queensland, in
Mr. Herbert’s Cabinet. Those were the joyous
young days of the colony- when immigrants were
pouring in in shoals and spouting their land orders
la all directions. Every ship brought, besides, a
saloon full of young fellows, mostly too lively for
the old country, but also mostly belonging to good
families, and bred as gentlemen—the real article.
We remember that there were in the hotels in
Brisbane, at one time, two grandsons of different
Dukes, one son of a British ambassador at a prin-
cipal Continental state, one ex-army man, brother
to a baronet, one son of a baronet, five cadets of
county families, besides sons of barristers, and
merchants, and doctors, past counting. The first
night after landing, the Hon John E went on
the tear, just for devilment, for be didn’t drink
After raising Cain through the town, h® finished
his performances by going up to the gates of the
old lock-up, then opposite the Royal Hotel—but
now improved off the face of the earth—md
thundered at the panels wit h an oak walking stick.
He was immediately admitted—to the cells; and
next morning old Brown, trio P.M. (rest his sou), a
‘•John Collins” vrai “his” whenever he was
asked) presided as usual, while Bernays, now clerk
of the Legislative Assembly, was C.P.S. In due
course, John E — was called, and stepped into the
dock with his customary bland smile, and old
Brown commenced to lecture him severely on the
enormity of his offence, thus commencing
his career in tho new world, and go on. But,
meanwhile, somebody whispered Bernays, and he
got up and whispered Brown, who suddenly
merged the magisterial in the paternal, and
warned “his young friend” not to so indulge in
vivacious pranks again, and discharged him with
a caution This was about tho last case, so the
Court adjourned just then, and Bernays managed
accidentally to meet the Hon. John be was a
grandson of the late Duke of Portland—in the
passage, and introduced himself. Then Brown
came accidentally upon them, and in the scene
which followed mentioned incidentally that his
was a John Collins. Let’s see what became of all
these boys. There was Hall, a dapper young
follow who had missed his mark in Canada, but
went to old Bowen’s first reception after landing
in a rifle uniform, bottle green, very swell. He
had been a lieutenant in a Canadian militia regi-
ment, the colonel of which was, we remember,
grandfather of another of the boys in the same
ship, and Hall and the grandson were great friends
in consequence. How easy it is for lads to strike
up great friendships, ehou I Well, Hall made love
to a barmaid in a country pub.—immoral love, for
he was too fine a gentleman to have any sense of
aonour where a mere daughter of the people
was concerned —although among his own class
his word was sacred. Wei), where were we ?
Oh, yes. He mashed the girl, and a stock-
man whom ho cut out mashed him. Threw
an empty bottle at him one night. It hit
his head, and killed him. Then there was the
young barrister. Fortune courted him. He had
only to hold out bis band, and briefs would have
been bundled into it. But ho crooked his elbow
Instead, and, when last heard of, was pick and
shovel man in a railway camp. Tho baronet’s son
did better. Wo always latterly Inclined to the
belief that his father had anticipated Rose-
bery by marrying into the Hebrew nation.
Anyhow, the son husbanded his draft, haunted
cheap auctions, and started out peddling Crimean
shirts and coloured handkerchiefs, and nlcknacks
generally, and did very wall. Then he settled in
town as a money-lender, and at last went home
again—probably with a little pile. A Scotch
judge’s son ran riot, cadged In a swell sort of a
way from station to station, and ultimately be-
came a State schoolmaster on £3 per week, in
which condition he married an assistant school-
marm, and remained until his father died, when
off he went home to to a fortune. Then there was
the young doctor. He was introduced to a practice
worth £1000 a year, free gratis for nothing ; went
down to Brisbane to register his diploma, and—
well, he was so desperate tor a pick-me-up one
morning a few weeks later that he collared a riding
whip from a hotel chimney-piece, pawned it, was
run iq, and got six months. Ilia shipmates got up
a purse and a petition. Bowen granted him a
pardon conditional on his being taken straight on
board ship, and he went home, too. Another,
well, he gut lost in the bush near Rockhampton,
and ho was never afterwards heard of. And the
other ducal party : ho and the stupid doctor gut
very thick. So thick that It affected their speech
sometimes. 1 1 was at one of these times that the
Hon. was blowing prodigiously about his shooting
feats, and, the doctor being disputatious there
ensued a sporting little bet. There was a back
yard to t e hotel, and only about ten feet of this
were visible Irom the passage. The doctor
wagered that the Hou. couldn't hit him as he
darted across that space. The Hon. booked tho
wrger, and lugged out his Manton doublebarrel.
Anutccr fellow, ex-Captain 11th Hussars, lately
billiard-marking on the Hodgkiuson. gave the
word. The doctor darted, the Hon. fired,
and hit ! The doctor wasn’t killed. He had a
narrow sqeak, but was a stout fellow, and while
all Brisbane rani/ with the episode it was never-
theless what is termed “ hushed up.” Well, but
to return to De Lacy Moffat. He was a grand
fellow. A gentleman from keel to truck, handsome
as a derai-godjand apparently well off. Ho died,
h iwever. a young man, and left his affairs pretty
mixed. The late Sir Joshua Peter Bell was one of
his raost’intimate friends, and the young Motfata
were on the easiest terms with Joshua Peter. So
when, as President of the Legislative Council
Joshua Peter Bell was acting Governor during Sir
Arthur Kennedy’s absence, he made young
De Lacy Moffat his Aide-de-camp, and young
De Lacy rode the flashest horses—anything be
could get a saddle on was quiet enough for a
young Queensland rough-rider of his sort. So
it happened that when his Excellency the
Acting-Governor was riding out with his Alde-
de-Camp, they ctme to a gate which had to be
openea. Whereupon the Aido-de-Camp, whoso
Imr-e was unmountable without seven men to
bold him, sang out in an easy style to His Excel-
lency, “ 1 say, look here, Peter, just get down and
open that gate, will you?” and "Peter” got
down, too, and told the story himself. Good
fellows, all that lot. And, oh I to come to what
set our pen going, we have just heard that De
Lacy Moffat has gone “home” with a Hxed pur-
pose just accomplished. He has ’listed as a lull
private m Her Majesty’s Life Guards, blue. And
the Queen won’t have many more gallant so dier»
than the young Queenslander.

There was a strong smell of glue when
Si<rnor Verdi paraded his Druids in front of a good
house to wrestle with the choruses of “Norma.”
But our attention was not wholly given to Wil-
liam’s clear voice and imposing figure. It was
mostly taken up with the vagaries of a Jewish
lady occupying one of the front seats. With ear-
rings as large as dumb-bells, and a smile like a
South Sea idol, she distributed praise and blame
with good-natured impartiality. There must have
been some difficulty in filling up the ranks of
Druids, and so a few had to be taken who were not
up to the regulation size. One demonstrative
little fellow in the middle seemed to regard Norma
and her goings on with peculiar vindictiveness.
We thought, at first, it was a boat-hook he had in
his girdle, but close inspection showed it to be a
dagger—a Damascus blade of exceptional purity
and finish. It was the sort of weapon to suggest
deeds of violence and bloodshed, and from the
nervous manner in which he fingered the hilt
when the discovery was made that Ncrma (like a
good many more we know) was not nearly so
simple as she looked, we felt, instinctively, that
in outrage was contemplated, and that the small
but determined-looking person in white would
effect his cruel purpose as soon as the curtain
went down and his brother Druids had scattered,
is*
Miss Montague was a plump, pleasant
Norma, who attacked the music as if she liked it,
and was determined we should all participate in
her pleasure. We never heard her to greater ad-
vantage. The difference in artistic training be-
tween her and Adelgisa was very noticeable in
florid passages. And this reminds us that, when
she said “Adelgisa,” a serious-looking old chap
next us put on his hat and struck for the open air,
saying he didn’t believe in swearing.

“The Bohemian Girl ” again on Saturday.
The cast was the same as in previous representa-
tions. We never knew before why the Austrians
are so unsuccessful in their wars. The French
nearly always thrash them, and the Germans
bolted them in one bite at Sadowa. It’s because
of their banners—that is, if the two-headed eagle
wo saw on Saturday night is a fair representation
of the imperial biro. It would be quite impossible
for men to fight with enthusiasm under such a flag.
No matter, Charley still continues to draw big
bouses, and there’s no change ahead in this res-
pect.
m m « *
The Majeronis are once more with us, and
open at the Opera House on Saturday, 26th, when
“Jealousy,” one of their most successful pieces, is
to be given. Theatre-goers who remember the
great Bistori do not need to be told the style of
article the Majeronis bring. Their repertoire is
replete with society plays of the best Class.
“Fedora” (in which Sara Bernhardt took London
by storm), “Odette,” “ Friendship,” “ Camille,”
“A Kiss,” “Jealousy”—these are some of the in-
gredients in the bill of fare. It is with these that
the Signor and his talented wife have won from
American and Continental critics sufficient praise
to last for a life-time. It was in Sydney they first
performed in English, and, after years of study,
our virile tongue comes now as trippingly from
their lips as if they had learnt it at their mothers’
apron-strings. Among the cognoscenti of Mel-
bourne there is but one opinion regarding the
Majeronis, and that is that their superiors have
not yet found their way to Australia. Coming
from a town that, like Sydney, has witnessed the
long line from Kean to Creswick, this is saying a
good deal. And, when we say further that in the
company are to be found the names of Glover,
Douglas, Musgrave, Rodney, Brooks, Novaro,
Docy Mainwai ing, Maggie Ford, and a crowd of
others, we believe we have said just enough. Our
old friend Monty Browne has the business manage-
ment.
* * * *
There is a sensible diminution in the Royal
audiences, so that the advent of the “ Silver King”
is hopefully looked for, both by management and
public. The words of the pantomime are stupid,
without being quite stupid enough. This seems
paradoxical, but is a fact all the same. When a
thing is exceptionally good, it usually pays; when
•tig d bad, it nearly always rakes in the greed.
It is only when it squats on the border-line of
mediocrity, and is neither very good nor -very
bad, that it turns out a pronounced frost. There
are, of course, exceptions, like Bees and Vogrich’s
concerts, and some others we could name, where
first-class articles seem to hang fire, and will not
“ gee,” but this is because people don’t understand
them, and don’t want to. There is no more me-
lancholy sight than that of a Western “ squatter.”
ora Sydney alderman at a classical concert. He
plants himself as near the performers as he can,
with a firm determination to enjoy it, just as a
larrikin saunters up to the triangles resolved not
io bawl, but before the performance is half over,
in either case, all the good resolutions are as dead
as James Carey.
• • •
There are only two classes of writers who
should try their hands at pantomime—those who
have a thorough knowledge of the requirements
of rhyme and rhythm, or else those who arc as
innocent of information on the subject as-as a
country railway porter of the soft answer that
lurneth away wrath. In the one case the show
will draw, from its excellence, in the other from its
inspired idiotcy. In a city like Sydney there should
be no difficulty in picking up types of either class—
especially the latter. There is now before us on
our desk a pile of poetry en route to an empty
champagne crate outside, and it is not too much to
say that any of the gifted children of song who
sent it in could write a pantomime that would run
till Easter.

At first we thought we had wandered into
a church bazaar got up by Dr. Hughes and Mr. C.
Bright for the conversion of Jews. But wnen the
gorgeous one appeared, and told, in touching
language, the story of the latest spoiling of the
Egyptians, while the band struck up “ The Girl I
left behind me,” we knew we were in the Aca-
demy of Music, that the “ dioramar” of our doings
on the Nile was passing before us to subdued
lights and appropriate music, that the portly
person so anxious to communicate facts concern-
ing the Sphynx and Tel-el-Kebir was Zulu Thomp-
son himself, and that the claret jugs, tea-trays,
rocking-chairs, decanters, and things were the
“gifts” intended for lucky ticket-holders, when
the cheers that greeted our success in North and
South Africa had subsided. Notices pasted about
the hall, vised by a party named M. Hegarty,
showed that the punishment for smoking was ex-
ceptionally severe. “ Anybody caught smoking
9 r making a disturbance.” they ran, “will be
immediately expelled and handed over to the
police, and prosecuted next morning, and not
allowed admittance again during the season.” The
fast threat showed refined vindictiveness, alien to
the spirit of the age, and to the precepts
of Christianity. But we think it is seldom
enforced, for on the night we attended a
coloured person in front of us, who appeared to
nave indulged too freely in rum or “ backshish,”
or some of the numerous excitements affected by
orientals, having made a few highly depreciatory
remarks on the truthfulness of the pictures—
oofng especially cynical on the legs and “ get up ”
the Highlanders swarming over the ramparts
oi f el-el-Kehir—was merely requested to retire
and give a chance to those who were not so dis-
agreeably critical, as he saw him in a “pub.” a
snort time afterwards wrestling with a pot of
Poer- we felt that all the penalties would not bo
mulcted, and that if he conducted himself properly
or two, the exclusion “during the re-
mainder of the season” might not be insisted on.
u was the Sphynx that fascinated us. If she is I
anything like her repi esentation, it is certain the
British will never leave Egypt without putting a
ton or two of dynamite under her. Until we
visited Mr, Thompson, we were ignorant of why
the Duke of Connaught got a command in India
and a decoration for Egypt. It appears that he
superintended the removal of some railway
trucks when the station at Cairo was blown up.
Taking the situation in at a glance, it struck him
that by raising the brakes the waggons would
make their own way down an incline. A masterly
flank movement set them free, and tho young
warrior had the satisfaction of saving them from
the flames and seeing them smashed up against a
neighbouring stone wall. If this does not lit the
young man for an independent command, we
should like to know what would.
* * * *
And now Zulu Thompson’s off to Mauritius,
and is to be succeeded by tho legitimate drama,
the exponents of which are to be Professor
Miller, Laurence Foley, Esq., and M. Victor. We
consider this entertainment to be more alluring,
even, than horse opera, We trust, however, that
the exponents of the glove and tussle business will
appear in “ chaste and appropriate attire.” There
is to he boxing, there is to be Grmco-l'tornan
wrestling, there ai’e to be Florentine statues, illu-
mined by lime-light [and accompanied on the piano
(“kindly lent for this occasion,” &c.) by an odd
musical fish who has reduced his scales to per-
fection, and the proceedings will be initiated by
an oration delivered by Laurence himself.
And now let us say good-bye to Zulu—
To William Thompson, Esq., K.C. (Knight of
the Cruet), on his departure for the
Mauritius.
Off to Mauritius—tare thee well,
But dost thou not with terror blench ?—
For us the grisly tile to tell—
You’ll have to lecture. Bill, in French!
You’ll, William, have to parley-vous.
And, when you show up in the hush,
You’ll have to sacre nom de dieu /
And mounseer and mad arm the “ push.”
We fancy. Bill, we hear you do it —
“ Pour kelker person is ce cruet f"
You'll have to wax-end your moustache;
Of Paree, say “ C'est magniflque!"
You’ll have, and this is rather harsh.
To con your “ Ahn’s First ” all the week!
When back again your flight you wing,
You might . . we love those dark-eyed lassies;
But, if you can’t, why, hang it, bring
At least some rum, Bill, and molasses!
And mind, dear Dioramic elf,
You’ll be quite sure to bring yourself.

Glover, who, it will be remembered, was with the

cently been elected G.W.C.T., of Dubbo, necessitat-
ing his constant attention. Little Joe Brown is
still Majeroni’s secretary, and Monty Brown is
playing his usual role before the opening of his
show-following up the bill-posters with a brick.
Curiously enough, both Monty and Joe Brown are
ex-pressmen. But they have both caught the

Josh Pickersgill has favoured us with a
tremendously long communication from Dunedin;
but “Pick.” writes such a shocking bad hand that,
after a tough wrestle with his pot-hooks, we must
acknowledge ourselves partially defeated. It seems,
however, that his show (amongst other things)
encountered, during his N.Z. tour, sixty-threo wet
nights out of sixty-seven. The horizon has
brightened, however, for—but let the gentle comp,
unravel it “ The great Donald Dinnie, the
Scottish champion athlete, America, &c., has

feel sure I shall make money, because, you know,
when at wrestling, &c., I put him and Miller, and
Victor and Foley, &c., together, l guess they will see
something to knock ’em silly.” We heard a man say
Josh was a bit of a visionary once, but weinstantlv
denied it. Whatever Pick is, and he is a host of

We read, largely, the efforts of the London
dramatical crickets, and we try very hard to ad-
mire them. Clement Scott is picturesque in the
Theatre and forcible in the Daily Telegraph;
‘ Carados,” said, in spite of all (though even George
Darrell, who knows almost everything but how to
fix a cistern, can’t say), to be Henry Simpson (“ Pen-
dragon,” formerly editor of Fun), is lightly satiri-
cal; Bichard Leo, of the Morning Advertiser,
is dull and laboured, but scholarly withal; Mow-
bray Morris, of the Pall Mall Gazette, who is
ponderously sarcastic; and G. A. Sala, of the Illus-
trated London News, a specimen of whose style
we will give you. Writing of Robert Buchanan’s
The Sailor and his Lass” (we’ll leave Mr. Augus-
tus Harris out of It, this time, for a change!), he
ends his critique thus (and it must be remembered
that Mr. Sala’s notices are supposed to be in the
highest style of modern critical art): “ I am think-
ing of giving up hansoms and taking to ‘ growlers,’
all on account of that pearl and paragon of four-
wheel cabbies so splendidly played by Mr. Henry
Jackson.” If we wrote like that, we should hear
from our editor—or, rather, we should hear from
our editor’s hoot.

PEPPER AND SALT.
Seventy constables rolled up to the Mel
bourne Artillery Barracks, on the 10th, to be ex-
amined with a view to promotion. The examin-
ation was conducted by Messrs. Brodribta, Mont-
fort and Moore, and the day was devoted solely to
the subject of Reading. It was a touching sight
to see constable 80,300 lay aside his white helmet in
the ante-room, and wipe the sweat from his
classic brow as he heard himself called to go
through the painful ordeal. Passers by thought
an epidemic of influenza had assailed the barracks,
so constant was the coughing, so stertorous the
breathing. It was only the constables clearing
their throats. Constable 80,000,000 laid himself
out on a form and fainted twice. It was noticed
by the examiners that he looked a little dazed, as
they pointed to the big sheet hanging against the
wall and asked him to go on. We never hoard a
constable rend, so the account we got of his per-
formance interested us. The sentences were a
paraphrase of a Miltonic passage, beginning
“ Adam, for eating fruit, was,” &o., and the candi-
date, if he shaped well at the first couple of words,
was pulled up with “That will do, sir, that will
do; now for the intelligence. What is meant, &c.”
Board to Constable 80,003,003, while he was a
little dazed“ Look there! What’s that ?”

ships.”
B. “ No, no, we’re not war-ships. Shake your-
self up and read what’s on that board.”
C. standing very close to the board and labori-
ously scanning the lines: “ A damn for eating
fruit ”
—B.: “That’ll do, that’ll do; we see you can read.
Now for the Intelligence. What meaning do you
take out of the sentence ?”
C,: “With all respect, sorrs, I think it’s idle and
profane languidge. But, if it has any meaning, it
must be that a respectable man won’t do it. Whin
the fruit’s green, sorrs, it makes ye sliddcr; and
oven when it’s ripe, too much of It isn’t good,
sorrs.”

C. “A damn, sorrs, for fruit.”
B. “ But what did ho mean to convey ?”
C. “ 1 don’t like to commit meself, sorrs, but I
think he meant whin a man feels dry, that instead
of fruit a little something sharp would do better.”
B.: “ Very, good. You pass.”
It is quite true that the seventy passed. This is
not a very brilliant anecdote, but if the reader
only know the sort of whisky sold in Melbourne
during the past couple of months he’d bo as

even this much.

SOLD.
(Dedicated to the Peerage Admiration
Society.)
No paltry belted Earl, ’twas thought, was sailing
o’er the sea,
When once more from its oilskin sheath flashed
R.B.’s parapluie;
And light was Dan O’Connor’s heart as any fairy
cork— >
His dreams were but of coronets—be scorned alj
thoughts of pork!
Hard were the hands of old J.H., he meant to step
aboard,
And by the thunder of his palms urge all there to
applaud I
And with his shoes, to gain the young lord’s notice
ho would try;
For though he’s bunions on his feet, he’s frenzy in
his eye!
The Council swore this time, despite all symptoms
of distress.
They’d read the Marquis, when he came, a welcom-
ing address;
The motion It was seconded and carried, too, we
ween—
Oh, melting, on the Marquis, w'as the eloquence of
Green I
The dovecote Ministerial was in a flutter, too,
They talked about the Vernon and about the
Mountains Blue;
The “ pitch,” too, was of picnics upon the verdant
sward,
Of Baumann’s fairy catering to load up that young
lord.
In sweet anticipation—that is to say the least!—
A holy smile upon his face had each expectant
priest!
Oh, they had waited long for this, but it came not
too late, \
Then dusted was each small red bag and burnished
was each plate.
The dream is faded; dried up quite’s the eloquence
of G reen;
And once more “on the Island,” deep In pork, our
Dan is seen I
The gamp of little Bob is once more shielded from
all harm,
And clenched with disappointment dire is ev’ry
priestly palm!
But don’t despair! perchancd some noble cub will
come out soon.
And tho’ ’tis dark as midnight now, then ’twill be
light as noon;
Cheer up; forget the bitter taste of this small dose
of gall,
’Twill not be long ere you will have another chance
—to crawl.

It is stated that the Newcastle people were
“grievously disappointed” at the non-arrival of
Murdoch and Alex. Bannerman. It don’t take
much to grievously disappoint the miners. What
we can’t conceive, is the ecstatic bliss which would
be our lot if we could see a representative team
arrive without the great eaptain and the “little
stonewaller.” But, then, novelty has a charm for
us— especially in the hash lino. The cricket fever
has now fairly set in, and now we must expect a
fresh seven months of how Murdoch was “ well
set;” of how Bonner “lifted it clean over the
fence of how Midwinter “snicked it to the off
of how Palmer was “ well on the wicketand of
how Giffen “ hit one to the chains for a quartette.’ ’
They have all their little vocabularies, these
wonderful writers, be they police-court, dramatic,
or sporting, and yet warm up the cockles of their
hearts with something long, and not very dear,
there is not one of their number who will not
talk about the “guild of letters” and “thebrother-
hood of art,” accompanied bv much frenzied
gesticulation—an unwise excitement of manner
which only too often necessitates, prior to depar-
ture, the loan of a needle and thread from the
barmaid.

THE GREAT BRISBANE BATTLE.
Spencer Browne, of Brisbane town.
Hit Keith upon the nob,
Spencer Browne, of Brisbane town,
Was fined in forty bob.
“ A pity, ’tie,” now Spencer thinks,
“ For forty bob is eight drinks I”
“A pity,” Keith, too, says, says he,
“ That forty bob don’t come to me I”
So each brow wears a furrowed frown,
As each one promenades the town.
But in some eyes, believe it you,
That Spencer is a hero true;
And Keith, when goaded, loud declares,
“ He came upon me unawares!”
But there’s some joy; for each man glints,
Throughout the land, in all the prints;
But for this battle, all must own,
Each pigmy would be still unknown I
If lasting fame, though, both would seek,
They must get up a fight each week ;
And in the records of each match
Note down each splutter and each scratch;
And write out elongated pars.
Describing all the kicks and scars.
With headlines, or ’twould be a fault:
“Another Cowardly Assault;”
And some in type the largest sized.
Called “Insolence Once More Chastised.”
Do this—get telegraphed and read—
Or once more to the world you're dead.
By way of building up a little journalistic
par., we may mention that the Normauton
Herald is, according to the gospel of Bobby
Byrne, defunct; and we hear, that the House of
Peers is about to start a magazine, to he called The
Lords— contributions only to emanate from their
own body. This wouldn't be a bad bint for our
Upper House. A publication by our peers would
be exceedingly attractive. It might contain,
amongst other things, say, a paper on “ The Ab-
stract Principles of Disinterestedness and Self-
denial,” by the Hon. John Lusas ; ono on “ Dese-
cration,” by the Hon. W. R. Piddington ; a sonnet
on “Spirits,” by 8. H. Terry; and so on. Had
not Sir John Robertson descended to the Lower
House he might have enhanced the attractions of
the magazine.by an article on “ Tho Language of —
Flowers,” or a lively sketch called, “ There and
Back for Sixpence.” With the venture printed in
antique type, arid having a nicely engraved fossil
in the corner, we are sure there are iu this colony
a considerable number of people who would
cheerfully owe for it.

For a good old blood-curdling, hair-
lifting, marrow-freezing, delirium tremens breed-
ing tale, commend us to the Be, a Gazette's
leader on the Waterloo horror. To enjoy this
shriek properly, one would require to hear it
recited in the Wollongong cemetery during a
howling tempest at midnight by Herr Bandmann,
or some other “grade tra-a-a-gedian,” end with a
suitable accompaniment of blue fire and Der
Freischutz music. Try and imagine the scene as
you read. (Tremolo on the violins, blue-fire, and a
wail from a distant fog-horn.) Tragedian advances
on his toes, and hisses:-“’Twas Christmas night at
Waterloo. Last time it was at Woolloomooloo.”
This is rather unsatisfactory; because if Christmas
night goes dodging around like that, no ono can
tell whether tho next festival will be held in
Jembaicurabene or Jupiter. Ho reads again:
“Thescene is the Mount of Carmel, and the actors
in the horrid tragedy are a crowd of larrikins, and
Catherine Owen, a vagrant aged 50, carrying a
shilling’s worth of rum in a bottle,” En paren-
thesis, this is a cruel libel on the ginger-beer bottle,
because it was fatally injured and it’s contents
spilled before the tragedy began. Proceed: “It is
an hour after midnight, and the night is dark;
except Mrs. Arnold and Mrs. Logan, both respect-
able married women, there appears to have been
no one to interfere with all the unknown devilry
that turned Catherine Owen into a torn, naked,
bleeding corpse.” (Full orchestra fortissimo —
more fire, and sixteen boys shake a lot of blue
metal up in kerosene tins. Shrieks from all the
surrounding graves). Just to prevent any doubt
as to Mrs. Logan’s respectability, it is necessary to
remember that at the trial this lady admitted it
was not her first appearance in a Court, but she
declined to say whether she had been convicted
fourteen times under the Yagrant and similar
other Acts. But, hush ! He speaks again, and
yells: “Where was the Elijah to call down fire
upon these worse than human savages, with their
* brutal shouts of merriment and their ruffianly
language?’” If the Elijah was a clergyman, he
was probably rolling about on his downy bed with
a bad attack of the fantods, brought on by an
overdose of Chateau Lafltte and lobster salad;
but if Elijah belongs to the “foorce,” he was no
doubt either doing a gateway snooze or surround-
ing the salt junk, pickles, and tangle kindly pro-
vided by his own Susan Jane in her cozy kitchen.
And so the Bega Scream keeps on, until it winds
up with a telling appeal for a testimonial to
“ bravo Mrs. Logan, who, no longerable to restrain
her anxiety, ran up to the fiends, spoke to them
out of the midnight datkness, and caused them to
decamp like so many dingoes after a gorge!” For
poetical beauty and truthfulness to the' subject,
we venture to think that dingo simile has never
been equalled, and now we’ll adjourn while the
Bega bard refreshes his soul with the heel of a
saveloy and a shilling’s worth of rum in a ginger-
beer bottle.

We see that a man in Melbourne has been
knocked down and robbed of £31, and that his
assailants were identified by two young ladies as
“Squash” and “The Whopper.” One of them
has been caught; though, so far.Vwc ai’e in a pleas-
ing condition, of uncertainty as to whether the
person in custody is “Squash” or “The Whop,
per.” This poetic little introduction reminds us
that this ago is more than over the age of slang.
Newspapers, we notice (though we have retnon,
strated with them), indulge largely in slang.
Chiefly small newspapers. The Illustrated
London News, for instance. George Augustus
Sala, who, by the way, builds up, sometimes, some
sad drivel, in stating that Punch had been
attacked by the Saturday Review for some allu-
sion .to Rabelais, says that journal gives Mr.
Burnand's paper “ toko for yam.” We have occa-
sion, sometimes, in order, chiefly to render our-
selves intelligible to the clergy, to use a bizarre
phrase or two—chiefly of our own invention—
when a glance, on tho following week, over the
country papers reveals the fact that all the Sydney
correspondenfs have reproduced them—nearly in
every ease where they didn’t apply—besides stud-
ding their copy with a very painful amount of
Punch’s corner English. Well, times, we sup-
pose, are changing; and we shouldn't be surprised
that if, in a year or two, papers were written in
nothing else but slang—and rum were a half-
penny a quart. How would a cablegram like this
look, now, in the Herald ?

He is a back-block squatter when at home,
bu% being anxious to see how the Victorian capital
looked at Christmas, he trotted down and wont on

his father confessor that, if the Loard spared him
this trip, he’d give £500 to the Pope and £50 a year
to the convent, and when he reached home he'd
build a spiendid church next his own house, and
pay the clergyman’s salary out of his own pocket.
Thanks to physic and prayer, he recovered; but
the only occasion on which the “clargy” heard
from him since was on last Thursday, when he
impounded the priest’s horse for breaking into his
lucerne paddock. Next time ho gets “snakes in

We’ve got a lot of interesting items about
H.R.H. the Duke and Duchess of Connaught
chiefly concerning the voyage of that gallant
warrior in the Cathay from Brindisi to Port Said.
The World has, concerning the perilous adven-
tures of the Duke, more even than the usual
amount of “slobber.” To take the lady first,
She was employed (among other things), remarks
this noble journal, in “promenading a quaking
(sic) quarter-deck, checkmating Colonel Keith
Fraser, with the chess-board placed on a gipsy*
table borrowed from the genial Captain Robbie’s
deck-house [a gipsy-table on a ‘quaking deck,

ning the entrance of the Canal by the aid of ®

means is best known to the writer; bnt as we sup-
pose he penned the letter In intervals of humping
about deck chairs and cleaning the plate, we must
not be hard ou him. The Duke, wo are told, was
“icrupulously deferential to those about him,
and "while the brilliant sky-blue pyjamas, m

He was a Judge of a neighbouring colony,
and being a married man he dearly loved the
ladies—single or double, dfdu’t matter a point of
law to His Honor. He took them as they came,
and was always rubicund and jolly, husbands with
clubs and thick boots notwithstanding. At a gold-
fields town he once fell in love with a beautiful
barmaid, and after presenting her with a gold
watch, a diamond necklace, and a paper collarette,
he persuaded her to promise him admittance, at
midnight, into her chamber, where alone in that
building he said a good view of the comet could
be obtained. The young lady, in the innocence of
her heart, explained the situation to the Boss of
the hotel, and the Boss took Jupiter, the black
cook, into his confidence. And at midnight’s
awful hour every bed-room door of that populous
caravansary was partly open, and the occupants
in darkness and expectation silently awaiting the
catastrophe. And it came. First a hurried shuffle
of something white and ghostly ran along the
passage from oue bed-room door to another, then
a whisper of endearment in a low judicial tone,
followed quickly by a wild, unearthly yell of
demoniac laughter, as a light was struck in the
room, revealing to the horrified intruder, not the
pretty barmaid, but the devil in person, black as
midnight, with great saucer eyes and glaring
white teeth grinning horribly at him—horns, tail,
hoofs, all complete and terrible to behold.
Then came a shriek of wild despair from
the Judge, as he rushed from the room in scanty
attire, and lied desperately dotvn the long
passage, ' pursued by that yelling fiend with
a lighted torch, revealing to the astonished
spectators the prodigious stretch of His Honor’s
nether limbs, when thus seen to the best advan-
tage in full and uninterrupted play. Then a roar
of laughter went up from that hotel clear to the
Milky Way. Every bedroom door, except two,
sent forth a peal of applause, which shook the old
house from cellar to roof-tree, and scattered the
shingles over the town like leaves In Vallambrosa.
When His Honor heard the shouts of merriment
he took In tho situation at a gulp, went down
stairs in two strides, and clothed himself with a
table cover aud confusion la the pantry, till the
noise had subsided, and the lights were mercifully
extinguished. Then be slunk back to bis bedroom
and dreamed that he was sentenced, by tho black
cook to fifty years’ penal servitude.

The old way of putting it is the best, and
so, with just a formal apology, we trot out our
familiar friend, the assurance that truth is
stranger than fiction. At least it is to most of us,
Mr. John Rogers, of Warrnambool was, until
recently, the proud possessor of an only cow, and
thereby hangs a tail. A few days ago he lost a
valuable watch and chain, and all efforts to re-
cover the same proved fruitless. Shortly after
this, however, Mr. Rogers’ son, whilst milking the
aforesaid cow, was surprised to hear the watch
ticking inside of her. Mr. Rogers then remembered
that the day he lost his watch he had been cutting
some greenstuff, and In all probability the watch
fell amongst the feed and was subsequently
swallowed by the animal. One would think Mr.
Rogers would have been satisfied to let matters
remain as they were, as he knew where his watch
was. But he w s apparently afraid that the cow
would pawn the property, or lend it to a neigh-
bour’s bull to wear on Sunday. A sixpenny watch
key was still missing, and, in order to recover
this, the cow was explored and the lost key dis-
covered. But the cow died under the operation,
which was performed by a coloured butcher and a
Yankee axe. What Rogers should have done was
to hang that cow on a nail over his pillow, and
then, by taking a small llask to bed with him over
night, he could not only have a stiff glass of rum
and milk before he arose every morning, but he
could also arrange with the cow who held the
watch to call him at the exact moment he re-
quired it.

Snake stories, as a rule, are so outrageously
incredible as not to demand a second thought from
the reader: but we think the following authen-
ticated story of ophidian intelligence well worthy
of note: —Just below the Wee Waa lives a shep-
herd, old Bill Johnson, who had amused his many
hours of solitary leisure in taming a young carpet-
snake which he had one day captured, and which
he bad taught various tricks—to dancs to the music
of a concertina, stand on Its head and crack its tail
in imitation of a stockwhip, etc. etc. “ Ben,” as ho
called the creature, was an indefatigable mouser
and birdcatcher, and would always bring the result
of his sport to share with his master, whom he in-
variably followed out and home again with the
sheep. In course of time “ Ben" grew to be some-
thing like 12 ft. In length, full of fun and life in tho
summer, and In winter retiring into the recesses of
a box filled with old blankets, etc. The old shep-
herd was extremely fond of his curious pet, of
whom he was wont to remark with pardonable
pride that he was “ knowinger than many a Chris-
tian white.” At last, one evening as Bill descended
the steep river bank for the usual bucket of water,
his foot slipped, and in he wont right into a deep
hole, where, being unable to swim, he did the next
best thing in the intervals of drowning, which was
to cry lustily for assistance. “ Ben,” hearing the
row and coming quickly to the top of the bank,
took in the situation at a glance, and hissing furi-
ously in his excitement, hastened as quickly as
possible to the edge of the water where fortunately
grow a small sapling; round this “Bon” in a
second had coiled his head part and thrown the
rest of his body out to wh.re his friend and bene-
factor, now nearly exhausted, was still feebly
struggling. As luck would have it, the tail just
fell across tho old man’s face, and, eagerly grasp-
ing this novel life-preserver, Bill hauled himself
safely ashore. The overseer of the station coming
up a few minutes later, was surprised to see the
old man on his knees, still dripping wet, anxiously
feeling along his favourite's vertebrae, whilst
rubbing in a copious supply of “ Farmers’
for, as he explained, “Tho strain must ha’ bin
somethin’ orful; and when I heord poor old Ben
crack again, I thought sure he’d a lot go, but no
fear, eh, old man ?”
Yes,' children do give odd answers occa-
sionally, and unpleasant ones, too. Wo have all
heard of the Yankee lad who, being asked by his
teacher, “ What’s the difference between me and
George Washington?” bawled out, “ Please, sir, ho
never told a lie.” At Paddington Public School,
the other d iy, a clergyman tried all ho knew to
elicit the word “parsimonious” from a class.
“Now,” said he, “what would you call a person
who grabs all he can get and .‘gives nothing In
return?” “ Pa—par-pars— p—” he prompted,
as the class seemed to hang fire. “ Parson,”
yelled a little chap who had been vainly
endeavouring to attract the good man's atten-
tion, and was apprehensive lest such a chance
of showing thej result of his youthful observa-
tion might not again occur. The lad has not dis-
covered yet why he was walloped. , .

The accompanying sketch map of the
regions affected by the Mahommedan rising in the
Soudan will enable our readers to comprehend the
events which have occurred, and which may
follow. El Obeid is the place where El Mahdi
annihilated the army of Hicks Pasha. Khartoom
is the last hold of the Anglo-Egyptians in tha t
region. Should it fall, there is said to be no
strategical position where a stand could with fair
prospect of success be made for the protection of
Egypt, between Khartoom and Cairo, till Ekhmim
is reached, a place but a day’s march from Cairo,
the capital The present design is to land rein-
forcements at the port of Souakim, and so threaten
the flank and rear of the Mahdi’s army should he
advance towards Cairo. Massoweh is the port
which it was proposed to give to the King of
Abyssinia as a reward should he consent to create
a diversion by attacking the Mahdi in the rear.
Scotchmen.—We all know that Garibaldi
was a Scotchman. Mr. Fergusson, of Parramatta,
a great authority, has told us that the British
Solomon (the author of the Counterblast of To-
bacco) was a Scotchman, and now we are informed
that the constructor of the Suez Canal was a
Scotchman, too. There is no end to these Scotch-
men. It is well known to the erudite that Jamie
M’Blackie, the progenitor of the aboriginal Aus-
tralian race, was a Scotchman, who, with all his
clan, emigrated from Ben Lomond, just before the
last glacial period, in a steamship built on the
Clyde by Sandy M'Adam ; and the discoverer of
Auourn, the loveliest village of the plain, Oliver
Goldsmith, was also, we believe, a Scotchman.
He accompanied Captain Co< k to Australia, and
spent a very pleasant time at the village hotel so
eloquently described in his poem. Auburn is
entering into a new state of existence, it is becom-
a manuiacturing town, the railway to the interior
passes through it, and two large engineering es-
tablishments are commencing work close to the
station. Mil's and Pile will hold a sale of allotments
< n the ground, on Saturday afternoon, the 2nd
February, on very easy terms, and the enterpris-
ing auctioneers have engaged a special tram for
the occasion.*

This paragraph will, we trust, be read with
rapture at the Sydney University. It concerns D.
B. W. Sladen, the poet ot that sanctuary of classic
culture. Mr. Sladen was up on the Blue Moun-
tains, lately, and the admiring elements got up a
thunderstorm to welcome him. The grateful bard
wrote a sonnet on this, and got it printed in the
Town an n Country, It begins:—
“ O, reader, was it ever thine to see
A battle of the storm and hurricane.”
It was ours. And if the gifted Sladen had been
out in some of the thunderstorms we have seen,
the search party that would be sent after him
would have to cut him out of a hollow log, like a
“goanna.” This is not poetry, hut it is fact, But
wo dare say that even tinder such conditions he
would compose sonnets. Nothing can discourage
some men. « » *
There is war iu Samoa—or rather there
ujfl* war in Samoa, for it is now over. It arose in
a dispute between two chiefs about the succession
to the Kingship of an oyster-reef. Fifteen men
were killed before the matter was settled. This
reminds us that one day we invaded Shark Island
with a view of dispossessing Laycock of the
throne. We admit, with shame, that we were put
to ignominious flight by a brigade of quarantined
pigs led by a billy-goat. Our commissariat, con-
sisting of a ginger-beer bottle filled with rum and
four German sausages, fell into the hands of the
enemy. This was not from any lack of bravery
on our part. It was merely the fortune of war.
But we shall sit on the throne of that island yet.

This is good news for the dead. The
Devonshire-street cemetery is shortly to be re-
sumed for railway purposes. A good many skulls
that have been boarding-houses for worms will
then, we suppose, revisit the glimpses of the

of those buried there will ever get.
Mr. H. H. Hayter, Victorian Government
Statisticlan.
This gentleman, whose portrait wo give in our
front page, has earned distinction in a field very
little cultivated in these colonies. Mr- Hayter s
name is known, not only throughout these colo-
nies, hut far beyond them. His function is to
take up the figures relating to his colony where
the Registrar-General leaves off, and to extract
from their dry arithmetic conclusions of general
and appreciable interest. This Mr. Hayter has
done. He presents the strange phenomenon of a
Government servant who revels in his work.
Signor and Signora Majeroni.
The excellent artists whose portraits we give In
page 9 are not unknown to Sydney audiences,
although it is now several years since they per-
formed here. Signor Majeroni came to this colony
with the famous Rlstorl, of whose company he
was a leading member. Tb© Signor remained
when Ristori departed, and, with his talented wife,
addressed himself to mastering the English lan-
guage. It was a brave undertaking, and bravely
; sustained. Before long, both h id sufficiently
familiarized their vocal organs with our rugged
tongue to be able to perform in one or two pieces.
Of these, wo remember “The Old Sergeant,” was
one, and in this Signor and Signora Majeroni
started on a starring tour through the_ colonies,
winning everywhere, despite the still inevitable
■ imperfections of their accent and pronunciation,
and by sheer force of their dramatic genius, the
highest encomiums. Fortune seemed ready to
fling her favours in their lap. Overflowing
! audiences everywhere greeted them, when the
i tickle jade suddenly played one of her cruellest
i tricks.' Signor Majeroni’s voice gave way, and for
years it was hopelessly lost to him for histrionic
1 purposes. The star actor and true dramatic
I genius—for such we believe him to be—
had to be content to be manager for other actors,
some ot them not worthy, in a dramatic sense, to
i loose the latchet of his shoe. Patience at length
1 was rewarded. The Signor’s vocal organs gradu-
ally recovered their elasticity and force. He had
meanwhile persistently familiarised himself with
English, and his equally talented wife rejoining
him—she had found it necessary to accept engage-
ments in America, for even genius must work to
live— the pair resumed the boards together. Their
second debut was made, the other day, in Mel-
i bourne, and it was immediately perceived that
they had lost none of their pristine Are and inspi-
ration. On Saturday they open at the Opera
House, in “Jealousy,” and we can, with well-
founded confidence, promise the public a genuine
and artistic treat.

The Waverley Pale Ale.
A good number of people will remember the
cheering 1 predictions of success with which, almost
ten years ago, a start was made with the celebrated
Waverley Brewery, by Messrs. Burrows and
Gleeson. The effort of the proprietors was to
adopt all the latest scientific improvements, and
to turn to advantage the splendid natural advan-
tages which the site at Waverley gave them. It is
a well-known lact among brewers that there can
be only one basis for good, pure ale—and that
basis is good, pure water. The present site of the
Waverley Brewery was fixed upon as preeminently
giving this great advantage. The source of water
supply here is a pure crystal brook, which has
splendid natural filtration in the sa«d and sand-
stone rock through which from hundreds of feet
below it arises. This water is received and stored
in a gigantic reservoir, cut in the solid rock, where
tho temperature is seldom or ever above
degrees. All the latest appliances are to bo found
in the brewery' for the various processes of brew-
ing: and then comes another great natural advan-
tage which the proprietors have been sharp enough
to avail themselves of. The property of the brew-
ery comprises several acres, which preclude tho
possibility of building out, bad drainage, &c., and
it is so situated as to command on the one side the
pure breezes from the ocean East and South,
while from the North, away across from Middle
Harbour, it receives the cool zephy'rs from that
quarter of our coast. Taking advantage of this,
the firm, in addition to having the ordinary
refrigerators, have an expansive shallow cooling
floor, where the beer, after passing from the
boilers, is cooled by natural process. The sides of
this department are lowered to admit the breeze,
and the cooling proceeds in the simplest and most
gradual manner. The effect of these processes and
improvements may' be tested by calling for a glass
ortanbardof Waverley ale when it is on draught.
Mr. J. Sharp, of the Gaiety', draws it in fine condi-
tion; so also do the following: Mr. Brewer, of the
Club House; Mr. White, of the Arcade. King-
street; Mr. M'Cleary, of the Colonnade; Mr. Hill, of
the City Bank Hotel; Mr. Coder, of the New
Brunswick; Mr. Spain, of the Barley Mow; Mr.
South, of the Manchester Arms; Mr, Webber, ot
the Post Office, York-atreet: Mr. Edward Trlckett.
ot Trlcketi’s Hotel, Bridge-street; and Mr. Dunn,
of the New York Hotel. There are hundreds ol
other hotels in the city drawing the Waverley Pale
Ale, but these within a certain radius are sufficient
just for mention.
Mr. J. Johnson's New Coffee Palace and
Hotel.
The announcement of the sale of the No.« Coffee
Palace, which was started under such favourable
auspices, directs attention to the extraordinary
success, in the immediate neighbourhood, of Mr.
John Johnson’s restaurant—which has certainly
proved a boon to the vast business population of
the Northern end of Sydney. Mr. Johnson came
in at the right time, and his success more than
proves the adage—every man to his trade. There
is hardly another business which requires such
watchful management as that of a public caterer,
and there can be no mistaking the fact that it is
in this very escentlal that Mr. Johnson ex-
cels. The premises are new and spacious
stone structures. Nos. 231 and 333, the property of
Mr. Johnson, and designed and erected by himself.
The buildings rise four storeys high, and have a
great depth and width, affording splendid facilities
for the requirements of a first-class hotel caf<S and
restaurant. On the ground floor is a spacious
dining hall, where a first-class shilling luncheon is
served, with ale, porter, or milk, included, and
which, consequently, has attracted a very large
crowd of people, who, hitherto, were unable to
obtain at the Northern end of the city, any such
accommodation. On the first floor are three large
dining rooms, the Is. fld, section, and including a
fine dining saloon for ladies—which Is conducted
with particular regard for privacy and comfort
Here on this floor, also, are smoking and reading
rooms, the furnishing throughout being first-class.
On the second and third floors are to be found the
best-planned bedrooms to be found in any one
house in the colonies. In no other part of the
establishment was Mr. Johnson’s design shown to
such advantage, and there is many an architect
who can learn something here of the great princi-
ples of light and ventilation. The visitor, on go-
ing through the establishment is impressed with
the spaciousness of the whole accommodation.
The bedroon> s are wide and lofty, the upper por-
tions being of moveable glass sashes, at all times
securing good light, the lowest possible tempera
ture, and the purest air. Nor is there another
establishment of the kind with so numerous an
array, on each floor, of baths and other conveni-
ences; ten times the usual space is devoted to this
purpose, and the patents are the best and costliest
procurable, securing the highest possible attain-
ments in this most important particular. The
whole area is carpeted or oil-clothed, and the
paperhanging for the most part is of the best gold-
stamped pattern-even to every bedroom. This
part of the establishment is well worth inspection,
and no better place In Sydney, at a reasonable
Hulbert’s Sydney Billiard Tables.
There is no questioning the fact that Hulbert, the
enterprising - young English billiard table manu-
facturer, who established a factory xn this city
about three or four years ago, is making a big
name for himself. The Hulberts are a race of
English billiard table makers, and the founder ot
the Sydney works can lay claim to the highest
encomiums from Roberts* Cooke, find other cele-
brated savants of the cue. Mr. Hulbert brought
with him to the colony a few billiard table artl-
zans, and their number he has since and is still
strengthening. The works were established in
George-street, near the Mariner’s Church, and here
an unpretentious start was made, the resolve
being that every table should speak of its own
merits, and that success should be won only by
trial and competition; and certainly Mr. Hulbert
has triumphed. The founder of the business soon
discovered splendid material in the Tasmanian
figured black wood, which has a magnificent grain,
is of great solidity and weight, and admits of a
superb polish. From this wood, table-legs of great
thickness, splendidly carved and turned, are made;
and the body, no less attractive, is procured from
the same source. The best pure native India
BlZ.
tariff of charges, can be selected by any visitor to
the metropolis. Of course the sensible plan has
been adopted by Mr. Johnson ot catering for the
mass of the intelligent public, hence, while on one
side the house has all the features of the best con-
ducted coffee tavern, the wants of another section
of the community are catered for on the other
side, where one of the best f urnished hotel bars in
Sydney is to be found. This bar is a picture, and
is supplied with the very best wines, spirits, cham-
pagnes, ales, porters, &c., to be purchased, and it
is from here supplies are drawn as required at
luncheon. Behind this hotel bar is to be found a
magnificent billiard saloon—where are two ot
Alcock’s best billiard tables, and two from our
local manufacturer, Hulbert, who has produced
here two tables of matchless excellence. This
billiard saloon wants to be seen to be appreciated.
And here again is the first-class design of the
whole place once more brought under notice. At
the rear of the saloon are spacious lavatories, &c.,
with water supply arrangements at all times,
securing purity and comfort. Omission was
nearly made of mentioning a splendid ice house
on the premises, about 13 feet squre, where meats,
&c.—all of which are purchased wholesale—arc
stored. The whole of the business is under the
personal supervision of Mr. Johnson, whose
eye travels over the cuisine as well as the dining
halls, and who personally, with Mrs. Johnson, sees
to the comfort and wants of his patrons. Mo es-
tablishment of the same kind in Sydney has proved
so successful. The furnishing and equipping alone
has cost £9000. The average weekly attendance is
between 6000 and 7000 persons—and the number is
increasing—a good result for plucky enterprise
and good management.
A Note for the Darling Point People.
I Day by day the people residing in the suburbs are
getting the facilities and conveniences of business
which previously were only enjoyed by residing in
the heart of the city. Houses of business of every
description are going up or extending their
branches, so that in the price and character of
goods there is nothing to tear in competition with
the first houses in the city. The patrons of that
tirst class hostelrie, the Darling Point Hotel, will
consequently be glad to hear that the popular
proprietor, Mr. S. Ryall, has opened two new
branches in connection with hi« business, namely,
■in extensive single bottle department and a
superior private bar. With regard to the first, Mr.
Ryall virtually adopts the wholesale principle for
the smallest order of goods in bottle, selling to his
customers at importers’ prices—a concession that
is certain to bo largely availed of, seeing that the
wines, spirits, ales, porters, &c, are of the
very best brands and character. Among
the largest lines are brands of the oldest and
choicest wines procurable from abroad. The
private bar has been decided upon by the pro-
Iprietor In connection with the wholesale-retail
principle, enabling customers ard families to get
their supplies without going to a public bar. The
private bar is neatly fitted up with facilities for
securing the most desirable privacy. Although
but a few weeks open, Mr. Kyall’s two new
branches have secured the patronage of the
majority of the residents, and a further extension
of business may be expected for the enterprise
displayed. It may, in conclusion, be mentioned
that Mr. RyaU is the agent in the Eastern suburbs
for Fallon’s celebrated Albury wines, which no-
where find more appreciation.
The Demand for Zigzag Mountain Coal.
A good deal of Interest has been manifested in
the demand which has exhibited itself for the
Zigzag Mountain coal. The company, who are
represented by Mr. T. S. Huntley, at 130. Pltt-
street, over Mills and Pile’s Mart, have only re-
cently commenced operations on an extensive
scale, but the coal, being of the very best quality,
has found already such a large market, that the
capabilities of the company have been severely
taxed. The Zigzag coal-mine is situate directly
alongside the railway line, so that in this respect
the removal per railway represents a minimum
cost, of which advantage the public reap the
benefit in the liberal tariff of charges decided
upon by the company. The seams worked in the
Zigzag deposit are among the finest in any Aus-
tralian colliery, and the coal is altogether unlike
other mountain coal, being of the character of
the best Newcastle or Wollongong, having
splendid qualities of combustion, with great
heat-producing force, and burning to a pure,
clear cinder. The largest demand for Zigzag
coal has come from the various brickmakers or kiln
proprietors all over the suburbs, who have found
15 cwt, of Zigzag coal to go as far as
a ton of other mountain coal. An experi-
enced brlckmaker can tell, at a distance, a kiln
burning Zigzag coal, as it produces a steady white
glow, with slow combustion, and the result is
seen in the hardest burnt brick to be found in
the market—a desideratum of the highest value
just now, when architects are stipulating against
badly burnt bricks. The company have agencies
at the railway stations at Newtown, Petersham,
Ashfleld, Burwood, and Parramatta, and from
these stations brlckmasters in all the suburbs can
have their supplies with every despatch.
rubber cushions arc used, guaranteeing ac-
curacy and speed, and never causing the ball
to jump. As lor the beds, they are of the
best Welsh slate, in no case ot less thickness than
Din., sometimes 2in. being used. On such tables,
the ball has perfectly silent motion, and the play
is always fast. Wherever Mr. Hulbert’s tables
have been taken, they have given the very highest
satisfaction. Various clubs, and some of the first
hotels in the colony, and many of our private
mansions, have now one or two ot Hulbert’s tables.
Two tables of first-class make have been in use
for some time at Louis’s, George-street, near
the Royal; and now two of the latest make are to
be found in the splendid billiard saloon at John-
son’s Sydney and Melbourne Hotel Cate, George-
street. Here the tables have been tested by the
best players in Sydney, with the one result—a
verdict of unsurpassed excellence. It ought to be
remembered that Mr. Hulbcrt's charges for even
his best tables are considerably below those of
other makers. The same words of commendation
may be used with regard to all requisites of the
billiard-room. Billiard connoisseurs should, how-
evci, liiS|-ect for themselves. This article is but
to serve the purpose of directing attention and
inquiry.

“ Tbe Stranglers” is a sensational play just on at
New York. The leading artist is a handsome man
off the stage, but, as Jagou the Strangler, is
hideously repulsive, the lace being painted a
bluish white, livid colour, and the horrible fingers
that twist and writhe around his victims’ throats
f re veined and streaked like those of an old ema-
ciated man. Jagon explained that he had learned
the pleasant pastime of choking human beings
when a slave holder in Africa, where, when slaves
were refractory, he used to have them brought to
him, and stiangled them for pleasure, till he be-
came an adept in the business. Ho commences in
the first act bv strangling an old sea captain. He
1 pulls him outof bed and lifts him bodily up by the

that they may have the full benefit of his facial
agony, and slowly shakes his victim until his
tongue protrudes and his eyes turn upward. At

I over the table, and the final agony of his death is
j veiled from the audience. When the victim is
quite dead, the Strandcr bursts into a glassy
smile and tossiM him aside. And this kind of

Who held the pass of Thermopyhe against

We are told that the Countess of Rosebery,

The prohibition, by Lord Derby, of annex-

Mr. M'Guiro. of Coromandel, N.Z., has a
practical wav of bringing municipal grievances
before the Council Fathers down there that wo
might copy with profit to ourselves. While the
Council was angrily discussing the advisability of
purchasing a gold chain for the Mayor, the other
day, the original Mr. M’Guire coolly marched a big
cart horse, all covered with slush, right up to the
council table, just to draw attention to the fact
that it was necessary to promptly repair a certain
road, into a hole of which his horse had just fallen
with a heavy load, and narrowly escaped suffoca-
tion. M’Gulre’s eloquence wasn’t much, but the
aroma from tho horse pleaded more strongly than
a thousand tongues.
For obvious reasons the four gentlemen
who were recently “triangled” in the Woolloo-
mooloo academy have slept face downwards ever
since. They say sleeping on the back prevents the
free action of the heart’s superior vena cava and
brings on tho funtods or nightmare. During the
performance on the triangle one of the soloists
asked the following prize conundrum, “ Why was
1 ever born ? ” Everybody gave it up, and it then
leaked out that the latercolutor didn't know him-
self. As tho “cat” bites worse a few days after
the scratches have been inflicted, we presume the
gentlemen referred to have some difficulty just at
present to discover which part of their back re-
quires the most rubbing.
At Clonourrv (N.Q.), five men went into
partnership. Four of them, by perseverance and
pigments, were made up to resemble Indian
C jolies, and the fifth, got up as an Anglo-Indian
sugar-planter just arrived In Queensland on the
look out for land, claimed them as his property,
and sold them to a tipsy squatter at £30 a head.
Some soap and water restored them to civilisation,
and while the squatter is scouring the country for
bis niggers they are drinking to his success in the
nearest shanty. Smart, this. Oh, and the corres-
pondent who sends us the story sends a lot more
news, but the language is too much in the board-
ing-school-miss style for our journal. It should
be sent to a religious paper.
A Melbourne daily opens oaf ajleader in
the following auspicious terms : “ Mr. Spriggs
Smith has written a book advocating temperance,
and giving illustrations from his own personal ex-
perience In the metropolis of pale al«.” This is
the sort ot English that breaks up the candidate
for university honours. Whereabouts is the metro-
polis of paio ale situated 7 With such a sentence
as this before him, the unfortunate candidate ran-
sacks his geographical knowledge, and, just as
time is up and he hands in his blank paper, he per-
ceives that the talk is not at all about Spriggs
Smith's experience in the metropolis of pale ale,
but about his experience of pale ale in the metro-
polis. Plucked, however, by slip-shod English.
A little tow-headed Surry Hills boy had
heard his mother remark that she fixed eggs so
that they would keep by setting them on their
ends in salt, and he made a mental note of the ob-
servation. The next day there was a crowd of
company to tea, and as the revellers were sur-
rounding the Quong Tart juice, the little urchin
begged his ma to make his aunt and her three
young daughters stay for the night. And when
she replied she was afraid she couldn’t keep them,
that had boy yelled back—“I tell y’ how to fix It.
Mamma. Keep them tho way you keep the eggs.”
Then Ma started a yarn about a one-eyed horse of
her Pa's, that used to open a gate with his teeth
and eat tobacco, but the company never smiled
once till they struck for home, and then they
fairly laid down and shrieked.
For watering their cabbages on a sirocco-
blowing Sunday some Chinese at Blayney were
fined. “ Me no breakve Shnnday. Me no put

was the absurd defence of these Pagans. Yes, and
there’s another place, a long way off, where a
venerable archdeacon gives a generally useful
man 27s. fid. a wee k and grave-digging fees-no-
body has died in the neighbourhood since the
Crimean war. To see the church dignitary in
shirt-sleeves and umbrella, leaning against a tree
directing the “generally useful” person whst to
do, while the thermometer in the shade is away up
among the hundreds, is a rebuke to the Infidel,
tho scoffer, and those “malignants" who would
introduce the Continental Sunday by allowing
people to save their cabbages on the Sabbath.
The decorum of social life in Australia is
marked and beautiful. Archibald Forbes said
that. We. therefore, chronicle that, «n the 29th
December last, at Preston (Vie.', Augustus Love-
day, a very old man, was driving a vegetable cart
alongthe street, when John Gay Roberts, a power-
ful young man, stepped out and said he wanted to
buy some vegetables. Augustus parted with the
vegetables, and asked for the equivalent. John
Gay lifted him out by tho neck, and laid him on
his luck in Plant’s water-trough. The Court, the
other day, fixed the tine. We ll let Archibald con-
c.ude; “Society in Australia savoura wholesomely
and Sweetly.” There is something wrong here.

Will some of our religious readers kindly
help us along with this lot. Wah L >ong, of Nar-
raoiiera, is a converted Chinese, and, being anx.ous
to secure a front seat in the celestial choir, he has
started to stud/ Britain's bulwark from end to end.
And, as a matter of course, he got badly upended
over every chapter. What knocks him out in one
rouni to-dav, however, is this: The Bible tells
him that Noah and his family were all that were
saved at the time ot the Flood. That’s all right.
But, then, tho Bible also says one Methuaaleh
lived to be 969 years old; and when the Flood—
which lusted a year—took place, this respected old
party was exactly 810 years of age. And now the
bewildered Wah L-wing is scratching his scalp off
trying to find out where Mcthusalefa managed to
stow himself away during that twelve months of
excessive dampness.
Rosebery has departed from us, and the

Melbourne iu particular lelt the loss bitterly, and
a select party of sycophants accompanied his
lordship down Hobson's Bay, to take a long, last
look at tho form they loved so well. It is to be
hoped that the butter «o perseveiiugly piled noon
him la the Victoria capital, didn’t have theoffeet
of making him bilious on tho trip to Adelaide.
The noble Etrl certainly did ait he could to
deserve the auulati in that was thrown athim.and
made himself “ very affable like ” during his stay
in Melbourne. He was especially forbearing In
the matter of the drains for it is a historical fact
that he strolled down Elizabeth-street, with Lord
Nevill one morning, when aromas of that un-
savoury tho oughfare were more than usually
demonstrative, and yet—such was his regard for
the feeliugs ot thocinzens—hestodfastlyrefrained
from being sick.
It was in a bar parlour. “ Did you,” ex-
claimed someone, “ hear of the terrible whirlwind
that swept dowu Barber-screet yesterday. Took a
baby clean out of its mother's arms, and, as I'm a
living sinner, kept the poor little thing suspended
in the air while it swept along for a distance of at
least 40 yards, and then deposited it nearly suffo-
cated with dust, but not otherwise injured, on the
verandah of Brock’s hotel.” “ Was there,”
eagerly demanded an auditor, “was there any-
thing the matter with its mouth?” "Not,that I
am aware of,” was tho answer; “why?” “Be-
cause,” replied the other, "in the last drought I
saw a child carried up just the same way in one of
those wretched affairs, and when at last it was set
down, curiously enough, also on a hotel verandah,
its mouth was turned right up and down Its face,
reaching from the nose to tho chin. It never re-
gained tho natural position, and they’re educating
the youngster for a missionary.”
“Call the ants bad here, do you?” he ex-
claimed as his host and himself watched the black
swarms climbing up the verandah posts, and along
tho roof and floors, in ceaseless streams—“ why,
th s is nothing. Should have been where I was
this time two years. Central Africa, sir, close to
Tanganjlka. That was the place, if you like ;
simply an immense ant bed. We were in danger
of being devoured piecemeal, and had at last to
shift our camp to a small Island In the middle of
the lake; but do you imagine that euchred ’em? no,
sir. Those animals had some savey, no error! The
big fellows, nearly six Inches some of ’em, got great
leaves, loaded ’em up with a tribe or two of the
smaller species, and next morning we could see
the surface of tho lake completely covered with
’em, paddling along with bits of bamboo, for all
the world like a lot ot Kanakas. Saw It was use-
less attempting to remain in that district, so got
into the launch and set off again down the lake,
and even then the disappointed little beggars
followed us for a day and a night. Talk of ants
eh I”
There was bliss in "the Russell-street
(Melb) Congi egational Hall last week. Some-
where about five feet of it, with copious girth,
and the ends well polished off. It could speak—
this parcel of bliss could—and moderately well,
too, and with sweetness and sympathy. It was
Miss Bliss. She had been away enlightening the
darkness of tho Madagascarians, but, owing to the
way tho French and the Hovas were carrying on,
she had to come round to Melbourne without
doing any trade. When she explained that, the
parsons In the hall took out their handkerchiefs
and wiped their eyes. When she told bow little
the Hovas knew about Christian self-sacrifice,
there was a general outburst of sobbing. And
when, after a little, she described how comtortable
most ot the people were, and how much property
was one way and another lying about among
them, the hall fairly echoed with tho palpitation of
missionary zeal. We must convert Madagascar.
Miss Bliss will go back again as soon as the war is
over. And so will we. We had no notion the
Hovas owned so many good things and were so
easily gulled. We’ll also bring a Bible, a great big
family one, and, when we come back, we’ll buy up
those city allotments we have been used to look at
with such a covetous eye.
The Town Clerk of Melbourne (Mr. Fitz-
gibbon), usually so genial and hearty, is beginning
to exhibit signs that his hie has reached the period
when gravity of demeanour and severity of con-
duct arc the right things to b© clothed with.
Whether this has been hurried on by the trouble
he has bad with the dog licenses, or by his frequent
interviews with Major Barker It is bard to say, but
the signs are stirring sorrow in many quarters,
an i eliciting remonstrances even from the mem-
bers of the South Melbourne Swimming Club.
That club, last week, announced a grand swim-
ming match to be contested on the Yarra, with
tuo intimation that the competitors would be ar-
rayed, “if anything, more decently than crick-
eters, ’ but when they arrived at the bank of the
river, a policeman stood there to arrest the first
who would get into the water. The policeman
displayed the mandate of Mr, Fitzgibbon This
was sad. The way those men got into their coats
and wended homewards, turning a tearful eye,
every now and then, in the direction of the Town
Hall, told of glories that were gone. “It you
swim in such confoundedly transparent toggery
as that,” said the Town Clerk, endorsing a Scotch
terrier license; “you must do it before Tam.
You hear?” And then he turned about and said,
*■ Major, when will you have the next muster of
the Hallelujah lasses ? ”
So far as we’ve gone in ’64, the number of
fatal accidents from “ I-dldn’t-knnw-’twas-
loaded,” shows a gratifying decline. There is a
prospect, Indeed, of the railway department being
called upon to cater for the public in the “sensa-
tion ” line, and It Is generally cheering to know
that the existing arrangements in that branch of
the public service will probably end in the roast-
ing of a train of holiday-makers. The other dav,
between Junee and Wayga, one of the carriages of
a mixed train caught fire, and, as there was no
means of communicating with the driver (such a
means, If you remember, would have saved many
lives and thousands of pounds to the Victorian
authorities) the guard had to crawl over the car-
riages to get the train stopped. We don’t know
the height of the bridges on this line, but we do
know that not long ago one of them took off a
man’s bead as neatly as Blue Beard removed the
heads of the poor women before ho met Sister
Anne. And wo know, too, that some years ago, a
number of people were burnt to death on an Eng-
lish railway because the carriage doors were
looked, and there were “no means of communi-
cating with the driver.” There is one lesson that
is never learnt, although the arising
from its neglect are of the most appalling, Hun-
dreds may bo burnt in theatres or railways. The
terror is as transient as widespread. There is a
public funeral, a subscription, a howl of popular
indignation and—another fire.

A lawyer is a gentleman by Act of Par-
liament. Bear this In mind or you’ll miss all the
point of this par. Not long ago an attempt was
made to levy black-mail on a respectable young
Civil servant by meaus of (us it was after-
wards proved) a totally unfounded chargeof child
paternity. Just before the case came on, a certain
Mr. Blucbag called on the Civil servant, and the
following chat ensued. Mr. r.: “ Good morning,
sir. I represent, Miss Blank. Bad business— /ery
bad business this 1 can assure you. Still, how-
ever, I have hopes—in confidence, 1 may i oil you.
very strong hopes-that this unfortunate matter
can be amicably and quietly settled. Now, my
client is willing to forego ail further claims upon
you, providing you pay her £50 cash, and bear all
the necessary law expenses. Liberal offer, that.
What d’ye think ot it?” “Think!" replied ihe
other, “well. I think it’s a d— piece of cheek.
I am innocent, and I’ll not pay a cent.” “Very
good,” said tho gentleman by act of Parliament;
“your Superintendent will hear of tbi- tn-mor-
row.” This, we submit, was a case of intimidation.
A few days after the legal gentleman called again,
and said : “ At my earnest solicitations my client
consents to stay all further proceedings on con-
dition that you allow her enough money to leave
the colony, and pay all costs of court, &c.” But
the intended victim si 111 held out; the case came
on, and was indignantly dismissed by the magis-
trate before It was halt heard. So the lady and
the lawyer were sent home on their ears, and not
a soul in this city was sorry for them.
Itema of intelligence from country town-
ships are always, or nearly always, overpowering
in their interest, and especially thrilling was a
telegram that appeared In the Melbourne D.T.,
from “our own correspondent ” at Camperdown.
Briefly stated, the facts are these. A Camper-
down sow inflicted a ten-inch bite on a boy, with
the result that “the blood from the broken
arteries flowed in alarming quantities ” But now
comes the reassuring part ot tb© telegram. “ Medi-
ctl aid was obtained, which was equal to the task
of stopping the flow of blood.’’ We cordially con-
gratulate Camperdown on the possession of
medical talent capable of grappling with difficul-
ties In such a prompt manner, for the last time
a sow bit us we nearly bled to death before it
occurred to any of our physicians to bind up
“the broken arteries.” But yet another item
from Camperdown. “The shire engineer was
recently returning from Port Campbell with a
number of persons in a large van, when it sud-
denly capsized, and upon the Jiving freight being
taken out. It was discovered that Miss Gubbins
was hurt in the side ’’ However, we are pleased
to find that you will not bo required to go into
mourning f >r Miss Gubbins at present, for the
telegram (this was a special telegram, quite dis-
tinct from the “sow” one) concludes with the
joyful tidings that “she was conveyed to a farm
house to wait until she would be sufficiently re-
stored to be taken home.” So you see that Miss
Gubbins is still a “living freight,” which is more
than we shall be soon, unless the Telegraph’s
Camperdown correspondent tones down his har-
rowing stories. We can’t stand ’em.
When a local preacher goes to expound
repentance and Obadiah In a country chapel, tho
brethren take turns about to sweep up the barn
floor, to give the circuit horse a good wholesome
dusty leed, and get in an extra sheep’s head to
honour the evangelist. J ustiflcatlon Brown was a
vessel noted for the unction of his discourses; but,
whatever the abundance ot his grace, it certainly

„ Sandusky, 0., May 21,1880,
I have used your Acid Phosphate and can pro-
nounce It a very valuable addition. I find it use-
ful and beneficial in nervous dyspepsia, nervous
depression following overwork and anxiety, as well
as the gastric derangements. Where there is
venous stagnation and sluggish circulation, a dull,
heavy head, it is of ur;doubted value. Fast grow-
ing children require this valuable addition.

In regard to the Hereford's Acid Phosphate, 1
have used It very extensively, and with tne most
remarkable success.
I give it in dyspepsia and in all cases where there
Is derangement of the liver and kidneys. With
my patients it has agreed wonderfully.

Nerve Tonic.
A. 8. Carpenter, M,D., Keene, N.H., says :
Hereford’s Acid Phosphate is a valuable medi-
cine. I have taken it myself, and for several
years prescribed it for my patients, when suffering
from indigestion or innervation of the digestive
organs, and always with satisfactory results. It is
a good nerve tonic, and in some cases of morbid
urine, * it acts like a charm,’ producing the desired
result. It is pleasant to the taste, acceptable to the
stomach, and is, in my opinion, an excellent and
valuable compound.”
Can be borne by the most Sensitive
Stomachs.
Fair Haven, N.Y., March, 1880,
Hereford's Acid Phosphate, in elegance of com-
position, stands unrivalled, it is pleasant to the
taste, and can be borne by the most sensitive
stomach. Have prescribed it with marked benefit
in indigestion and urinary troubles. It forms an
excellent substitute for Lemon juice, and as such
will furnish a refreshing drink for the sick.

BECAUSE the trimmings are of the best No. 1

From Mrs. W, Garrett, of Mount Victoria,
we have received a dainty little box of honey in
the comb. The box is made with glass sides, and,
ns the honey is in neat layers, it presents a very
tempting appearance. It seems amonstrou* thing
that when such honey can be produced in this
colony, and packed in so attractive and appetizing
a stylo, we should continue to import from Europe
and California the quantities we do.
A young man named Summers, sentenced
to four years hard labour and three floggings, for
robbing a drunken man in Little Bourke-atreet,
Melbourne, is alleged to be a victim to “ mistaken
identity,” and the Chinese interpreter, Mr. Hodges
(who certainly ought to be well posted In Little
Bourke-street affairs) has written a long letter to
the Chief Commissioner of Police, setting forth
what he doubtless considers to be the facts of the
case. Mr, Hodges, you must know, has been
collecting evidence,” which evidence is to the
effect that the robbery with violence, for which
Mr. Summers is languishing in gaol, was really
committed by three young men, named re-
spectively Brown, Jones, and Robinson. Somehow
wo fancy that the Bonrke-street lads have been
having a bit of a lark with th" worthy Interpreter
in supplying him with the names of such a world-
renowned trio. At any rata, this particular Brown,
special Jones, and identical Robinson, are not at
present forthcoming ; go, in tho meantimo, the
unfortunate Summers has received flogging num-
ber one. Herewith we appeal to the better feel-
ings of B., J„ and R„ and beg of them to oome

A “ HALLELUJAH ” IDYLL.
(After Tennyson.)
In the moadow, while the sunset
Shod its glory thwart her face,
** Happy Jane r ’ besought her lover
To be “sanctified In grace,”
Angels surely wept with pleasure
Gazing down on such a scene—
She a “ hallelujah Lassie,”
He a lad of seventeen.
Warmer grew the maiden’s pleading—
Heavenly flre was in her eye;
“ Would he still be so unheeding?
“ Did he never dread to die ?”
Thus she spake in accents mellow.
As they sat upon the grass—
He a verdant, fresh young fellow.
She a “ Hallelujah Lass.”
Softly stole the breezes balmy
O’er the sweetly-scented plain.
As he whispered “ Hang the Army I
Be alone my happy Jane;
Lot the * captains go to blazes,
Pitch away your tambourine I”
Blushing Jane her blue eyes raises
As she answers “ All serene I”

Alas for frail humanity, it would appear
that a morsel of blue ribbon attached to the front
of a coat must not be accepted as an infallible cer-
tificate of the strict sobriety of the wearer, more
especially if he happens to have a pipe in his
mouth. Mr. Francis Murphy, the well-paid apostle
of Temperance, has taken an exhaustive poll of
the teetotallers in one of the English counties, and
finds that smokers are just five times more liable
to break their pledges than men who have never
been slaves of the fragrant weed. For the future,
therefore, Mr. Murphy has that “pledge”
takers shall be offered the additional privilege of
binding themselves to neither smoke nor drink, the
double-barrelled resolve to be denoted by the
adoption ef a blue ribbon with a whlt« line run-
ning down the middle. This is altogether a very
pretty idea, and one that may he enlarged upon to
any extent. For instance, the addition of a rod
line might proclaim a regular attendance at church
—the further introduction of a streak of yellow
might Inform our friends that we’d “s«vornoff”
cards, and so on. Naturally, for the use of such
people as “elders” and newspaper editors, an
extra broad ribbon, containing all the tints of the
rainbow, would be specially woven.—

In people who love the Blue Ribbon to sport
Our faith has been recently shaken.
For It seems they don’t always behave as they
ought,
In spite of the “ ylodge” they have taken;
’Tls sad to reflect such backsliding should be.
But statistics have made it quite cleat
That many who swear to take nothing but tea
Get wetting their whistles with beer.
But the strongest temptation—you’ll please under-
stand—
To return to your habits of “ soaking "
Attacks you directly a pipe's in your hand
(We always get thirsty when smoking);
So your chance of conversion is very remote.
If this Blue Ribbon Army you enter.
Unless that the ribbon you wear in your coat
Displays a white line down the centre.
It was a dull time in Backtowfh The
knocking down of cheques seemed to the pub 11-
pans, as they sat In their several verandahs list-
lessly watching the grasshoppers go by, an ex-
ploded observance —a thing of the long past.
Presently, toiling along the hot, dusty road, publi-
can No. 1 espied a swagman. But, as he came
nearer, his hopes of a customer fell below zero.
Ragged, dirty, and footsore, the traveller threw,
with a heavy thud, “the curse of Sod” off his
back on to the verandah, whilst saying, “ Mister,
could you give a feller a glass o’ beer an* a feed
this New Year? I've had hard luck, an’ bln travel-
ling long without a Job.” “ No/’ was the suily re-
sponse, “I couldn’t. Takes a man all his time just
to live now-a-days, let alone giving feeds an’
glasses o’ beer away to every traveller as Comes
i Heaving a deep sigh, the wanderer again
shouldered his “drum,” and, as if in pursuance of
a set task, wont through exactly the same actions
and formula at each one of tho six pubs, which
Backtown boasts, and with the same and worse
luck, for some taunted and abused him as a
loafer; and always with the same weary sigh,
which, as he afterwards remarked, “might ha’
moved a —- gohanner, ’ he again resumed his
burden, till at the last hoUSe, whose proprietor
was also listlessly counting grasshoppers, he
found chanty in the shape of, notone, but several,
glasses ot bear, a square feed, and an offer of a
6hake»down for that night, the old landlord say-
ing, “ Although times is dull, I don’t never let a
hard-up man as calls go by without a drink an’ a
feed. I been on the wallaby myself In this country,
an’ may be agin yet. Stranger things ha’ happened
out here, I reckon.” Next morning, the swagman,
putting money in notes and cheques to the amount
of £95 into his host's hands, remarked, “Keep
that, an’ tell me when It s done, all but a fiver to
go on the road agen. I’ve bin working at Boloro
this twelve month, an’ I’m going back after Anni-
versary ” Then, like a man with a heavy burden
off his mind, he commenced to “ keep up the New
Year,” employing his sober Intervals, though, in
visiting those other five pubs , arrayed in gorgeous
apparel, “ chiakleg ” the proprietors to his heart’s
content as they stood eagerly watching lor the
next ragged, worn, and weary swagman to come
along.
DENOMINATIONAL DROPS.
Over ninety-three millions of bibles have
been issued by the British and Foreign Bible
Society, since its organisation. And the religious
papers complain that hundreds of thousands of
people have left the church of late years. This
comes from the distribution of bibles. Those who
get them are enabled to see bow little the church
is like what it should be. The Church of England
is a child, as far as wordly wisdom is concerned,
compared with the Roman Catholic Church. R
saw the folly of placing the blble in the hands of
the multitude. The British and Foreign Bible
Society is an advertisement of the weakness of
the Church of England.
The Rev. W. Hutchinson, after preaching
once in his now cure of Mansfield (V.), threw up
his holy call and returned to the more congenial
and culchawed vineyard of Alexandra, He says
he poasitavely declines to-aw—labour in a town
of such “moral desolation." And this is the
disciple who claims to bo the servant of the m u ek
Nazareen who was never more pleased than when
he was in the midst of the vilest sinners. The
“shining robe” department of Paradise will have
a heap of troble to satisfy the (esthetic taste of the
Rev. w. Hutchinson when he arrives, and we
“lucerely trust the celestial ushers will see that he
has a box seat all to himself and, if possible, next
to that of the Royal Family.
There was a Diocesan Conference in
Chester a few Wijeks ago, the Bishop presiding.
One clergyman—the Rev. Thomas Hughes—rose
his lordship clean out of his seat, and made the
assembled parsons snort, with a paper he read on
‘The Church and infidelity.” waile few of an
ordinary to Thomas—
knew much of the metaphysical cobwebs tpun
round the words “ substance ” and “ person,” they
Could all understand that they were liable to be
damned for not knowing. Again, he thought that
the Church's attitude towards Science was driving
all the young men into hostility. There is no
doubt that towards Science Christianity has been
a stepmother, and a very bad stepmother at that.
It Is scarcely necessary to be told that “ the paper
was coldly received, and no discussion took place
upon it,”
Bishop Garrett, of Northern Texas, on
being nominated lor the cosier and fatter see of
Indiana, wrote a letter to his nominators, from
which we make subjoined extract, and round
about which wo can’t help thinking real grit
makes a genuine ring •—“1 am not insensible to
the personal advantages presented by the enthu-
siastic support of sa fide a body of laity as have
fixed their generous Choice upon me. Cut the
soldier of the cross must not seek the flowery beds
of ease. Though I should be entirely alone, and
neither clergymen nor laymen could be found to
follow, 1 should still feel it to be, not aiouo my
duty, but my privilege, to hold this burden against
all enemies, until I fall, or re-inforcements can
come up. Therefore, beloved, give my grateful
thanks to the noble men who desire for mo an
easier, and if you will, a higher place. But do not
let them spend ihoir time and strength in vain :
for I am rooted to this wild country until I shall
be planted ’ in its soil in the hope of a bettor
resurrection.”
Herman Merivale, who nas written good-
paying plays, proceeds to make merry over the
■peculations ot Hackel, of Jena. It shows, what-
ever serious views the play writer has of the
speculations of the modern evolutionists, he at
least is capable of a Voltairean indifference to the
significance of the phraseology. Here is his ver-
sified summary : -
“ Fast dying out are man's later appearances :
Cataclysmitic geologies gone—
Now of Creation completed the clearance is :

of the essence of science, whether ancient or

Those of us who were old enough in 1*59
to know our tables or spell through “Caesar,” will
never forget—till forgetfulness follows on decom-
position—the ecclesiastical tornado that swept
over England when the “ Origin of Species ”
modestly saw the There was not a struggling
curate looking forward to an incumbency, not a
the dogic 1 student struggling with Paley, but
contributed his crude observations to the general
screech. Poor Darwin—figuratively tarred and
feathered—passed by the small fry as a mastiff
does a rat-torrier, but—in the language of the P. R.
—“ cross-buttocked ” or *‘ chanoeried ” the leaders
till they (also figuratively) howled for mercy. He
was about the ugliest customer they ever tackled,
and small blame to them if, in our day, they elect
to enjoy their incomes, marry their daughters
well, and steer clear of biology. But they have
done more. Many of them have come round to
Darwin’s views, and the Bishop of Melbourne (Dr.
Moorhouse) now claims him as a “ true believer.”
This is not so paradoxical as it appears, for, in a
lately published lett'.r, the great naturalist says:
“ What my own views may be is a question of no
consequence to anyone but myself. But, as you
ask, I may state that my judgment often fluctu-
ates. Moreover, whether a man deserves to be
oilled a theist depends on the definition of the
term, which Is much too large a subject for a
note. In my most extreme fluctuations I have
never been an atheist in the sense of denying the
existence of a God. I think that generally (and
more and more as I grow older), but not always,
an agnostic would bo more the correct de-
scription of my state of mind.”
Since gladiators hacked one another to
death in Home there has seldom been a more
ferocious combat than occurred a few weeks back
at Philadelphia. William Stahl, a young Western
man, claiming to be some of a fighter, said he
would not fear to meet any man living if he had a
club. Dl«ck Dallas, a powerful negro, hearing the
remark, took it up, and tho match was made.
There Was no ill-will between them ; they fought
for twelve dollars. A large room was secured ;
Stahl selected a heavy stick of smooth hickory,
and it was agreed he should only use it in his right
hand There was some disappointment when the
founds were fixed at one minute duration only,
with one minute rests ; but they were found quite
long enough. Toe negro's muscular development
was something phenomenal ; be was stripped to
the waist. They shook hands, and Stahl at once
commenced the battle by aiming a terrible blow
at his opponent's head. The negro partly
parried It, and tho club glancing aside fell
with great force on his iftoulder. Before the
Stick covild be lifted for a second attack Black
Dallas seized Stahl's wrist and attempted to wrest
the stick from him, at the same time administering
heavy body blows on the white man’s rite. The
struggle only lasted a moment, for the negro, with
a sudden wrench, bent Stahl’s arm back until it
seemed ready to crack, and then began pounding
him in tho taco with ihe free hand. Just as the
white man appeared ready to give up tho fight, the
minute was up and the fighters were dragged
apart. In the second round, Stahl whirled bis
club so ferociously that tho minute was within
ten seconds of expiring before the negro could get
near him. Stahl prodded him in the stomach,
making him grunt with pain and rage, as they re-
tired to their corners. Third round was a display
of fearful brutality. Sruhl began swinging his
sties as before, but the negro was too quick for
him, and got his long arms about his body. In this
position the white man was utterly help-
less. He feared to drop his weapon, and
his left arm was pinioned close to his side.
The negro, finding ho hud the advantage, began to
show bis teeth in a diabolical grin. “ i’se strong, I
Is," he exclaimed, and then suddenly shilling his
arms lower down, he began to squeeze. The pres-
sure was awful. Stahl s tongue protruded from
hU mouth. His eyes seemed starting from their
sockets. Tho cords of his neck swelled out as
though about to burst. Ho wagged his head from
side to side and made one desperate effort to free
his left arm. It was loosened sufficiently to break
the negro’s frightful grip, and then he managed
to transfer tho cane from his right to his left hand.
One end of it was placed under Dallas’ chin, and
with what remaining strength he had left Stahl
began to push. The darkey, unable to dodge or to
avoid having a hole punched in his neck, broke
away, and Stahl fell prone on bis face. When
the seconds picked him up, tho blood was trick-
ling from his nose, When tho minute’s rest had
expired, Stahl got up slowly and appeared totally
unable to go on. Whether this was a ruse, or
whether his strength returned momentarily, is a
question, but at any rate, when the black came
confidently iforward he received a blow, struck
with all the vicious strength of despair, fuil on
hij forehead, another sledgehammer whack on his
jaw. and, before he could dodge, a third blow
grazed his arm and peeled the skin from his shin
bone. With ail his passions aroused, tho black
sprang forward, and knocking down Stahl s guard
as though it did not exist, he again seized the un-
happy man around tho stomach. Stahl evidently
knew what to expect, for he struggled desperately,
and apparently in terror. Before he got away the
black managed to give him one terrible hug, and
then unable to bear up longer he fainted. Not th«
slightest attention wo* paid to rules of the prize
ring, but on conclusion of four rounds Dallas was
awarded the 13 dollars. Both men were injured
for life.

As Petersham Is a nice progressive suburb,
the Owls met last week as usual. Notwithstanding
that dancing people hate the heat, the height of
the mercury didn’t stop the hoot, ihe caloric
seemed to affect the members and the mercury
both alike—made them rise to the occasion; for it
was one of the club's best efforts. Dr. iebbutt,
president (a position apparently given to the owl-
dest owl of the club), stepped to the porch pie-
ctsely at eight o'clock, but the hoot didn t com-
mence till half-past, owing to some members
coming late. Woodpecker escorted Miss whomes
to the piano, and her fantasia on Scotch Airs was
pleasing. The new owl, Pippo, gave the champion
song from “Populairo” in a populair manner.
Herr Francik and a lady, on violin and piano,
played Do Beriot’s fifth air, and selection trom
” William Toll,” splendidly. Mr. B. Palmer s reci-
tation, “The Death Bridge of theTay, ’ was, we
consider, the gem of the evening. Mr. A. Murray
made his ftrst appearance, at the club’s invitation,
and sang “ Up with the Standard of England with
melodious spirit, the high notes exceedingly clear.
Mr. C. Cox also made his maiden appearance
'vith the English concertina. His playing of
’■ The Bells" was capital, and he had to reappear
n- d give “ Adieu.” Mrs. Wood and Miss Sheridan
Ueed bkndcdtheir voices tunefully in a duet from
• Semiramide,” and a number of other recitations
end songs followed till half-past 10. Some people
hi the back attracted notice bv chattering so that
i ho chairman had to honour them with a moment s
attention. As they were not owls, they were most
likely parrots. Several ladies accompanied the
vocalists, and, assisted by a gentleman, also played
for the dancers. Midsummer dancing dotsn t;
improve girls; their cheeks get crimson, and them
frizzes unfurled, and then they don’t look pretty.
But some were beautifully dressed. A newly-
married iady quite bore the honours in a lovely
heliotrope broche redingote and satin skirt
trimmed with lace. A pretty Balmain blonde wore
■ becked silk redingote and plain silk akirt. A
i*. tersham lady, whose husband was one of
Sydney’s most famous bassos, wore rich bla k
velvet, long train, and elbow sleeves, with very
ticep Maltese lace trimming. Another musical
I ply was charming in black grenadine and iace,
with satin body; and a tasteful white lawn decked
with ivy was as nice as was a cream llama redin-
u nto over a pleated skirt. Two Petersham sisters
wore black grenadine, with a flash of red sash and
creun satin respectively; and pink broche and
mil in suited a young lady nicely A charmer
1 ©stored her attractions with a neat garb of black
satin and white lace. The daughter of a big
1 iciory man wore pink satin ; a vocalist, pink
1 troche and satin; and by 13 o’clock almost every-
litly wore a general aspect of satisfaction,
especially as the refreshments were good and
convenient.

Some time ago, on his Academy being
completely renovated and beautified, Mr. Charles
Hall gave a hall, hast Friday, his friends proffered
him a complimentary return. Tickets were high,
tis it was determined to make the affair good, and
Vie glassy floor was comfortably full. Thedancing
hill is decorated in modern style, pale green
ari istio.illy varied in warm and cool tints, and set
oil with classic figures; a dado runs round the
walls, and ventilation and lighting are carefully
m udied. Mr. Frank Smith acted as M.C.—the only
wonder is that he Is not an M.L.C. Ladms were
mostly attired in costumes light and airy. A
blende from Bourke-strect looked pretty in cream
imp’s cloth in narrow iace flounces from hem to
b.-.t, and forget-me-nots. A veiy handsome dross
was worn by a Summer Hill favourite, olive green
..itoman velvet top, chenille fringe trimming,
and skirt of surah satin. From Cumberland-
rtreet, a fine girl appeared in a ruby vel-
vet square cut bodice, let in with satin
and pink cords; and cream nun’s veiling and blue
Katin also came from that part. Mrs. F. Smith
wore a line corded black silk; Mrs. Charles Hall, a
becoming costume of pale blue satin and broche
top, with a lace-trimmed redingote; Mrs. R. John-
son, a rich brown bronze satin and moire, with
passementerie; the wife of the “veteran Nat,” a
black satin trimmed with a new shad© of grey
flowers about becoming fashionable. A Stanmore
brunette woi’c pale pink satin and ctearn surah;
and also nice were pink satin and broche on a tali
dark girl; a cardinal satin let in with gold, low cut
bodice; a sombre black; a slate an t blue, &c. Mr.
Hall’s stringed band of six furnished excellent
music, aud the catering upstairs was without a
Vault, the wines and liqueurs and their “stronger
brothers” being all good. Me. R. N. Johnson, of
canary bird celebrity, engineered the affair, and
did it well.

Last week, in the Scots’ Church, Melbourne,
Mr John Dougharty (son of the well-known and
genial stock agent, Hon. J. G. Dougharty. of El-
wood) was married to tho youngest daughter of
the late Captain Lindsay, of Hobart. Six brides-
maids were Misses Telford, M’Pnerson, Pohlman,
Lang lands, Dougharty, and Watson; the first pair
in pink, second in cream, and third in green—all
of surah silk. The bride’s dress is said to have
been the handsomest ever seen in that church,
it was imported from home, and was of white
satin brocade, opening in front to show a petti-
coat of satin covered with seed pearls, side drap-
ings of richest real lace ; the bodice was cut
square, tilled with lace, and had a pearl-adorned
vest. A fashionable and numerous attendance
witnessed tho wedding.

Melbourne is setting terribly high-toned,
and the vulgar habits of such people as Lord
Rosebery we particularly distasteful to its extra
cream-laid society. So it would seem, at any rate,
from a lady’s letter to the Herald anentthe noble
Earl’s visit to the Victoria Club meeting, at
Flemington Says this cultured female: “The
Earl of Rosebery might have set a better example
to the youths of Melbourne than to mount the
box of the Governor’s carriage on Saturday, when
leaving the racecourse, with a lighted cigar in his
mouth, notwithstanding the fact of two ladies in
his own rank of life seated behind him.” Now,
we shrewdlv suspect that this lady’s ideas of “ ’igh
life in tho ‘hupper suckles ” are chiefly extracted
from sixpenny novels; but she is really very funny
when she draws special attention to the facts that
the ill-mannered aristocrat sported a lighted cigar,
and that the ladies of the party were in his own
rank of life. If the highly cultured one had hap-
pened to be a lady in “ his own rank of life,” she
wouldn’t have felt so aggrieved over that cigar,
nor have written such awful twaddle.

No one can watch the books of poems
lately issuing from the press without noticing
the tendency to picture fleshliness, and to minister
to voluptuous thought of tho broadest kind.
Well, Swinburne gives a marvellous, luminous
touch to his rhapsodies; he hai genius. Rosetti
throws a veil of dainty delicacy over the amorous
passion of his lines. Oscar, the apostle of the
purely fleshly school, without the genius of the
other two, is full of nudities and revealments that
modesty gazes at through its fingers ; yet he has
written some quaint, pretty conceits. The horrors
of Rollinat wo forgive, because he winds into the
intricate recesses of the soul, and, though coirse,
is wonderfully curious and original. But these
men are all clever. A book more remarkable in
one way than any of theirs has issued from the
press m Loudon. “Love and Music,” by Percy
Reeve, is more carnal, but not clever. It presents
love in a purely sensual aspect, with a coarse
shamelessness hardly equalled by any writer ; and
beauty as seen only by tho libertines eye. the
book is dedicated to “The Loveliest Living
Woman.” No clue is given, but as the author
“ writes up ” tho physical charms in detail of some
halt-dozen women, few would accept the dedica-
tion as au honour. One of these heroines ho
addresses as “ Most exquisite among the splendid
few.” To another he audaciously says, “ Princess,
1 care not what vour toilet be.” To Ada, he rap-
turously cries, “lam contented to die, my darling
is s > white ’; an* as he describes elaborately what
white portions principally please him, we are
i ustifled in inferring that hla carelessness as to her
toilet possibly led to its abolition altogether. Then
he addresses Venus, a lady
‘ Whose hair stings my heart’s blood,
Whose little biting teeth arc God’s mercies beneath
The rose red lips,”
who has “a whole sweet body made of loveliness,”
end whoso *• twined lips confess ten heavens in one
kiss I” Peopl° who get these ideas shouldn’t print
them. '1 hey are not poetical. Whole pages of
“Love and Music” are full of heavens made of
women's limbs and clinging kisses and other Ma-
hometan forms of bliss-kisses equal to “ten
heavens.” The book is a wholly unnecessary pub-
lication.

Last week a most interesting evening was
passed in the large hall of Randwick Asylum,
when a musical and elocutionary performance was
given in connection with the waratah Band of
Hope, and prizes were presented by Mrs. Hardie,
Mayoress, to the children. Besides several hun-
dreds of these latter, there was an extra large
attendance of visitors, and, on the dais were
Messrs. Kosoby, Graham, Davies, Alderson, and
others, including ladies. Mr. D. A. Thomas, the
Superintendent, occupied the chair until arrival
of the Mayor and Mayoress. Recitations and
songs were give \ by both girls and boys, and
several pianoforte selections exquisitely rendered
by a lady well known in Randwick for her beauti-
ful playing. One intelligent girl of some twelve
years old possessed a clear, flexible voice of good
Eower, and rarely sweet Another girl seemed to
ave great musical facility; most of the singers
were Indebted to her for their training, and she
well deserved the prize she gained. There was
nervousness in the manner of some of the reciters,
and room for more expression; but the pieces had
evidently been thoroughly learned, and the pro-
nunciation was remarkable for accuracy. Mrs.
Hardie presented a large number of prizes, and
there was a constant clatter of the juveniles’ feet
on to the platform, and off again with their
coveted books. The Mayor made a few apposite
remarks, and Mrs. Hardie promised to provide
prizes for the children next year. Visitors then
moved into another room, and. after refreshment
and conversation, fin illy moved off the premises.

To-night, Thursday, the grand Masonic
ball takes place in the new Hall, Casllereagh-
street. It is believed the floor will prove tirst-
class for dancing. Conveniences of all kinds are
provided, and the company will be a most dis-
tinguished one.

Invitation concerts (like most other gratis
entertainments) are generally well attended, and
the Beethoven Festival, held last Saturday after-
noon, at the Great Hall of the University, was no
exception to the usual rule, being numerously and
fashionably patronised. Long before 3 o’clock
nearly every scat was occupied, and many persons
were obliged to stand the whole time. It is doubt- |
ful whether, under different circumstances, such
a large audience would have assembled —for other
high-class performances lately given in Sydney
were financial failures—but then, as one knows,
free admissions have a charm for most
minds, not to add pockets. The programme of
Saturday was rather long, and slightly dull here
and there, so that some folks departed early. The
organ cannot be pronounced either a beautiful or
perfect instrument, by any means ; its tones are
rough and harsh, and there is no volume of sound.
Those who are answerable for its selection
in London are to blame. The gem of the
concert, was Beethoven's “Pastorale Sym-
phony.” This glorious composition was beau-
tifully played by a fine orchestra chosen from the
best musicians here. The concerto in C. minor, as
performed by a pupil of Herr Kretschmann, was,
on the whole, a creditable rendering, though
weak in parts. The vocal pieces wore decidedly
inferior to the instrumental, and the song “Ade-
laide” proved rather a disappointment, the voice
of the gentleman who essayed it being neither
fresh nor powerful enough for the exigencies of
the situation. The fair sex mustered in strong
numbers, and many pretty dresses were seen—in-
deed, quite a bewildering array of them met the
dazzled eye. White lawns and cream Indian
muslins wore popular; while zephyr cloths, sateens,
and brocWs were ubiquitous, and ihe redingote
and water-fall backs seemed first favourites.
Among thOoe present were Sir Alfred Stephen,
Miss Stephen, in a costume of terra cotta hue; Sir
George and Lady Allen, Lady Martin, Miss Q.
Eagar, in pale grey blue; Miss Dibbs, Miss Mac-
lean, the Misses Badhara, Miss Garran, Sir P. A.
Jennings. Judge Faucett, Mr. Paul, the Hon. John
Marks, Mrs. Marks in a splendid black ottoman
cord: Miss Marks, in dainty white; the Mayor, and
Mrs. Hardie in a sumptuous peacock brcche.

The employes of the Pyrmout works of
the Colonial Sugar Refining Company held their
annual saccharine divertissement last Saturday
down the harbour. A great number of friends
accompanied them, an A the quiet decorum with
which the picnic passed off on the spot where once
very opposite scenes were the rule showed that
“refining” influences had been at work. As the
day was fine, sports were enjoyed, and amongst the
novelties were a race for “ old fogies,” am' a gift
distribution, in which everyone secured a prize of
some sort. Dancing went on till a well-contested
programme was exhausted. An al fresco lunch
was provided for visitors, when the usual toasts
were proposed. On return in the evening, the
festivity was kept up by dancing in the Company’s
wor»s at Pyrmont for several hours.

A bright birthday party occurred at
“ Mertonville,” Balmain, last week, when cards,
dancing, vocal and other music enriched the
hours. The singing of a well-known lawyer—an
amateur baritone—was as good as always; and
the playing of a favourite Balmain planiste very
clever. Over supper a few cheery words were
spoken, and Mr. Hancock, the host, was felici-
tated on the birthdays he had left behind. The
daughter of the house was charming in pink
llama, with sashband of black; a young Burwood
lady in white raiment sang and danced well; and
a fair Balmain girl in black with military collar
looked the essence of neatness — At a late private
banquet in a Melbourne suburb there were twenty
courses; the ladies and gentlemen luxuriating in
tour hours’ eating and drinking. Heaven will be
quite a dull place to these people. ..To-morrow
night, Friday, the Burns Club will commemorate
Robbie’s birth by songs and dances in the Protes-
tant Hall Miss Nellie Veltch, whose splendid
voice has drawn notice to her elocutionary efforts
in Melbourne, is a pupil teacher in a Victorian
State school, and she comes from Ararat. It will
be remembered Miss Alice Rees came from Sta-
well in the same district Mr. T. D. M’Kay

On Saturday night, Mr. W. L. Murdoch’s friends at
Cootamundra met to drink prosperity to him ere

tained a good party in Wynyard-square, to mark
her oldest son’s return to Sydney. Dancing was
kept up all night, and many costumes were admir-
able: for instance, black silk and a solitary rose;
lavender silk, on a consistently quiet young lady;
and simple white, worn by a beautiful singer. Mr.
Huenerbein’s music was A1; and, with a brief
morning rest, most of the party started for a

Dear Belle,—Forgive me for neglecting to
write to you lately,but I promise to amend my ways
in future— so there, now I One of the events last
week was Herr Kretschmann’s Concert, which was
held at the University. The big room was com-
fortably filled, and the music was splendid. A
great drawback to the concerts held there is the
terrible scraping of the chairs on the tesselated
floor, which goes on without ceasing until every-
body is seated. To anybody possessing nerves it is
dreadful. Miss Mabel Allen, daughter of Sir
George Wigram Allen, and a pupil of Herr
Kretschmann’s, played splendidly. I thought her
hands pranced ,i ust a little bit too much, but that
will be toned down as she grows older, and after
all it’s a good fault, as it gives more freed9m of
touch. She looked so pretty, too, in a simple
cream dress, loose on her slender little figure, with
hat and feathers to match, and hair down her back,
and was perfectly self-possessed throughout the
long concert. As she left the platform she was
presented with a beautiful bouquet by a tiny
admirer. Another favourite pupil of Herr
Kretschmann’s was a Master Smith, of East Mait-
land, who violin<?d one of De lleriot’s concertos
with such brilliancy and taste that someday, unless
I am very much mistaken, he will be heard of
again. Such a memory, too! Although his
solo lasted over fifteen minutes, he did not
hesitate over a single bar or phrase. Madame
Merz looked very neat in a gray dress,
and a becoming brown straw bonnet, long brown
gloves. I can’t tell you what Madame Mardus
wore, for I only saw her head, but her bonnet was
composed of fine soft cream lace and peach pink
roses. Two sisters from Ashfleld looked their
very best in slate blue homespun, trimmed with
small checked material of same colour. One wore
a Henri Deux hat, white straw with black velvet
and white plumes tor trimming, the other a small
princesse bonnet. The Henri Deux hats are being
worn more than ever; in fact, they are becoming
quite common. The objection to them is that
one must either have the hair gathered up from
the neck, or cut quite close to the head, or else
look ridiculous.
Fancy, I only saw one lake-colour dress at the
concert on Saturday. It was composed of the very
finest cashmere, the skirt kilted at the waist, and
over all the inevitable redingoto; hat, plumes,
gloves, and parasol were all the same colour, and
you may be sure the tout ensemble was quite out
of the common. Miss Moss wore black corded
silk and small cream bonnet. Whites were numer-
ous, although the evening turned out quite chilly.
Miss May Wilshirc gave a concert in the Ashfleld
School of Arts, last week, for the benefit of the
Infants’ Home. I was sorry to see it so badly
patronised, the hall being barely half filled. Miss
wilshire worked hard throughout the concert—
rather too hard, in fact; for, besides playing
several solos, she had the lions share of the ac-
companying, which was too bad. Mrs. Foster sang
very sweetly. Miss Bull also gave two solos, nut
seemed glad when each was accomplished. The
piano and organ duet played by the Misses AVilshire
was much applauded. A beautiful dress was worn
by Mrs. Seaward: a rich black silk, the body of
which was almost covered with black bugle beads
worked in star pattern ; loops of broad cardinal
satin ribbon adorned the skirt, and the same colour
was worn in the hair, combined with small white
roses. The Misses Bull wore pale blue satin
trimmed with white beaded lace. A tvhite lawn
with gold zone was neat.
Some Block dresses were rather good this week.
I saw two sisters with sulphur-coloured skirts,
over which one wore redingote of bottle-green
velvet, and the other ruby-each having bat and
plumes to match. Peach pink is the favourite
colour just now, but I don’t care for it for walking
dresses—it Is too glaring. Golden brown is also in
vogue.
Don’t you think the way they make our watch-
pockets now, inside the body of the dresses, very
stupidV I, lor ray part, prefir the chatelaines,
although they do seem rather unsafe. I don’t
know whether you have s?en any or not.
They are made fo hook into a button-hole which
is made in the dress, instead of a watch-pocket;
the watch is attached to the chatelaine, and is
allowed to hang uncovered. You will find it
strange when first you come to wear one, but will
soon become used to it. I have only seen one or
two woi n as yet, so they arc by no means common.
Xow, I know you will want me to find out where
you can purchase the watch chatelaines; but I
only remember to have seen them in one window,
and that was at the Oriental Gold Company s, in
George-street, where thoy seem to have all the
latest novelties in the jewellery line.
I will tell you something of the dresses worn at
Theatres, in my next. So now good-bye. xr A n
Yours,
MAB.

Til MIL FRESE’8 HAMBURG- TEA
THE GREAT GERMAN FAMILY MEDICINE.
RELIABLE, SIMPLE, EFFECTUAL.
This well-known Tea has proved itself to be a
most certain and efficacious Remedy for such
diseases as Sudden and Severe Calds, Coughs,
Fevers and Ague, Asthma. Phthisis, Headache,
Bowels, Kidney, and Liver Complaints, the Piles,
Congestion, &c.. caused by an impure abate, or a
superfluity of blood. Its use removes Serofula,
Cutaneous Eruptions, Pimples on the Face,
Blotches, Boils, Rheumatic Pams, and Pains in the
Bones and Joints. It is a preventive against con-
tagion and destroys inhaled Miasmatic and Con-
tagious Vapours. It purifies the Blood, cleanses
the Stomach and Bowels, and gives to the whole
system a healthy, easy tone. It opens the bowels
in a mild and certain way. It works on the system
generally, causing little or no discomfort. It will
prevent almost any disease if used at least once a
month. It restores the appetite, it removes the
distress caused by eating hearty food or overload-
ing the stomach, and will be found effectual as a
Family Remedy where a simple purgative only is
needed.
NO FAMILY SHOULD BE WITHOUT IT. Full
directions in English, French, Spanish, and Ger-
man with every package. Sold by all chemists,
storekeepers, and medicine dealers throughout
the colonies at ONE SHILLING apacket. hole-

I HAD SALT RHEUM
■por seventeen years. I had It on my head
face, neck, arms, and legs. I was not able
to walk, only on my hands and knees, for
one year. I have not been able to help myself
for eight years. I tried hundreds of remedies;
not one had the least effect. The doctors said my
case was incurable. So ray parents tried every-
thing that came along. I saw your advertisement,
and concluded to try Cuticuha Remedies. The
Cdticura brought the humour to the surface, to
my skin. It would drop off as it came out, until
now I am entirely well. All I can say is, 1 thank
you most heartily for my cure. Any person who
thinks this letter a fraud, let them write or come
and see me, and iind out fur themselves.
WILL MCDONALD, *_
Dearborn St., Chicago, 111.*
Poiltical Points
Tho idea of disbanding the Permanent
Artillery Force because It has been mismanaged is
quite a Buchanaaian ono. We hope Parliament
will not assent to anything of the kind. If David
had a u flares ted the disbandment of the Com-
mander-in Chief, now
One-!mlf the people in the United State®
are said to be engaged in agriculture, and the
value of the agricultural interest is estimated to
be equal to that of all other pursuits combined.
What a contrast, this to th? state cf affairs in New
South Wales ! D'ye hear, Froe-selection Jack ?
Tho new Criminal Act works splendidly.
At Tamworth a sober man deliberately robbed a
tipsy man, and got two years. At the same time a
drunken man who, in his madness, annexed a
saddled horse from another, got three years. No
wonder the Judge said it was out of his power
to meet out duo justice.
Mr. Spruce Smith told the open-mouth
Guudageoso electors that tho members of the pre-
sent Ministry are all men of means, but the Parkes
combination was composed of the meanest of
men. *• For several years." continued the orator,
•• the Parkes gang had no way of obtaining a
livelihood except by pursuing politics; they were
simply men of straw, and came under certain
provisions of the Vagrant Act.” As Dogberry
would say, Write down—Sir Hal a vagrant. \v hy,
this is flat perjury to call a live Knight-a vagrant.
At the last general election in a Northern
town, a bush "spouter” was by a certain clique
put up for member, and, of course, ‘ blued’ his
Forty “quid,” or rather those of his supporters.
Shortly afterwards, a Ministerial visit took place.
Rushing up to the Minister for Education us he
alighted from the rail way can iage, the ex-candi-
date seized his hand, which, vigorously shaking,
he exclaimed : “ I did my best to get in. No go,
though, this time ; but, you b>t, I’ll be in with you
before long.” Calmly turning to the Minister lor
Mines, who was at his side, G. H. whispered :
“ Who the deuce is he ? But, never mind. J believe
myself his ‘ trout’ will carry him in some day.’
A memorial stone raised at Balmoral some
ten years ago to the Prince Consort bore the Apo-
calyptic inscription: "Ho being made perfect a
abort time fullilledalongtime; for his soul pleased
the Lord, therefore hasted He to take him away
from among 1 the wicked.** This was a little rough
on Scotchmen, so Dr. Candlish, the great Free
Church leader, said that he regarded it with the
deopestsorrow, if it is tho Queen who is responsible,
with indignation whoever else it may be.’ there
is a tine aroma of courtly casuistry in this— sorrow
if the Sovereign offended, inditfnation towards any
outsider. “ Oh, ye priests, ye priests 1” as old lom
Paine said. Tom said a lot more that wc have for-
gotten*
That tenant farmers and cotters can lie
happy and prosperous when fairly treated, was
clearly shown on the estates of old Lord Panmure,
father of Fox Maule. This eccentric old noble-
man gave his tenants life leases of their farms at
fair rentals, which were very Jow in comparison
with the extortionate rents on neighbouring es-
tates. The small farmers and eotteis of Glen Lsk
(in Forfarshire) were, in consequence, well fed,
well housed, and extremely comfortable in every
way. Poverty was altogether unknown in the
district. It a man met with accident or misfor-
tune, his neighbours were all in such easy circum-
stances that they soon set him on his leet again.
When F°x Maule succeeded, and tried to make
innovations in the estate, th« tenants could afford
to snap their lingers at him. and tell him they
were as well off as he was—they had a life interest
in the property, and he had no more.
Mr. Bucbananjwill shortly submit, for re-
jection by the Legislative Assembly, a resolution
that the practice of the English Government ot
conferring titles upon any of tho people ot this
country is inconsistent with tho spirit of our
democratic institutions and ought to be discon-
tinued. This resolution is all wrong. In the first
place, our institutions are not democratic. I he
spirit of our people is democratic, but our insti-
tutions are monarchical, or aristocratic, so long as
we have a Sovereign or a Government House. In
the second place, although the design of the Eng-
lish Government mav be antagonistic to demo-
cratic sentiment, their prnciice has been distinctly
favourable to it. A few more titles conferred as
they have been in the past, and the whole business
will become a sort of farce, in which the cold-
water interest and the rum interest will alternately
take loading parts.
This is a Free Trade colony. Make no
mistake about that lot. And yet, as a matter of
fact, cast iron pipes made from colonial ores are
carried on our railways for Id. per mile, but im-
ported pipes are charged at the rate ot jd. Ihe
extremely protected “ Cabbage Garden could
scarcely cio more than this. Another absurdity in
the way of our railway freights is that while the
public have their coal carried at the rare ot Id
per ton per mile, for 35 and not exceeding
55 miles, still the Government generously pays 5d.
for carrying theirs over tae same distance. Ibis
is simply throwing dust in the eyes ot an unsus-
pec'ing public by creating a revenue which the
legitimate trallic of the colony fails t< ? i' r< * d ! 1<
All this was pointed out by Mr. Whitton m 18*7.
In those days. Sir John, of Cloveiy, sat m the
Premier's chair, and a Lackey ruled tho Works.
So it came to pass that no more notice was taken
of the Chief Engineer s report than if it was a
Gospel tract or a Nooze leader. I
A “Socialist” procession, carrying a black
Hag on w hich “starvation” was inscribed, was not.
allowed to approach Guilihall while the Lord
Mayor and his guests were feeding. 'I hey were
known to be “Socialist” from the fact that most
of them were wasted with hunger and some carried
placards on which was written : ‘Many who will
partake ot this night’s feast have Intoned and
grown rich out, of the rents of tho filthy slums
which disgrace this city. Worse housed than the
beasts of the field, starving and wretched, our
noverty dealt with as a crime, numbers ot our
class have been done to death within the work-
house and prison walls.” Many of our bydney and
Melbourne friends whose incomes are derived
fromsimilar sourceswili agree with us in thinking
that a caval-y charge or a fusillade of breech-
loaders fsthl proper thing tor those whining
tatterdemalions who have not common decency
enough to starve in silence while those who batten
on their misery are gorging m Guildhall.
To practice upo»> the credulity of the pub-
lic to the prejudice of its healt h, is the worst form
of charlatanry. This is again being attempted by
scampish vendors of bad liquor, flavoured wit h
some cheap drug, and asserted to be similar to or
the same as Wolfe's Schnapps.
When the organs of accretion become in-
active by reason of a cold or other cause, the in-
llammatory material should be removed and
healthy action restored. Ayer’s Pills accomplish
this quickly, safely, and surely. Much serious
sickness aud suffering might be prevented by
promptly correcting such derangements which
often develop into settled disease.
Woman Items
There are nearly 19,000 more marriageable
young' women then men in Victoria. The only
outlook is old maidism or Morraonlsm.
A young student says the reason that girls
cannot play lawn tennis as well as men is because
ft girl's ribs are too small, her scapula too thin, her
clavicle too short, and her triceps extensor muscle
too large to allow of the girl being active. Then
there’s the trifling circumstance that the gin
generally shuts her eyes when she sees the ball
coming.
A young R.C. damsel up Cootaraundra
way is indignant—righteously, we think—at get
ting the sack from the choir of her church for
assistance given bv her at a concert in aid of the
Anglican church in the neighbourhood. What ap-
pears to intestify her Indignation is the fact that
some other damsels belonging to the R.C. choir
assisted at a Presbyterian bazaar, and escaped
sacerdotal censure. She should remember that
one person can steal a horse with impunity, while
another is hanged for looking over a hedge.
Down the South Coast, at holiday times,
(he favourite outings are riding parties. >t Npw,
colon ill girls flro not much ** on tne walk, but
they can rid* • and at one of these outings an
adorable lady having been left for a moment by
her cavalier, her charger bolted. She screamed.
He was bound for “ the sea, the open sea I and if
he’d once got there at the pace h« was going, they d
hive had to charter a yacht to capture him.
While a score of young men looked helpless on,
and her own Adolphus got o i his kneel to pray
(thit being easier and safer than anything else), a
horse and rider shot out from the crowd IT rged
to racincr 8peed, pell-msll over rocks and rusti s,
he puiluim? prad with a lighter ™ght gidaed
yard by yard, and just as tt o spray dashed in their
faces they reached the flyer, whica still refu ed to
be pulled un, and by sheer jockeying headed him
rhrht round and up hill again. The plucky pur-
suer was a colonial girl. The adorable ' vaa
very severe on her cavalier who had remained to
pray.”
Lately we have taken to the valuable
study of mind-reading, and having occasion to
enter a certain fashionable church (to escape the
rain), not long ago. we fixed on to the mind of a
gorgeously dressed xady in front and found her
thoughts ran as follows:-“Oh heavens ! that
dreary old dean again. Sorry I came. Wonder
who that fellow is with the Simpson girls. Nearly
time they hooked somebody. Well, [declare, if old
Mrs. Jenkins hasn’t got a crinolette as big as a
clothes basket. Wish this old fool’d dry up, and
blow away. Wonder how Verdi ’ll look os the
Count di Luna. How that Tallerman girl does lace

When a young lady enters a convent and
receives the “black veil” it is poetically said she
is dead to this world tor ever. Now, this may be
true, or It may not. Personally, we have no actual
experience in the matter whatever, and wo are
not particularly mad to gain »"uch either, but we
notice that so far as “ sweetly pretty ” or “ utterly
too too ” names are concor- ed, the ru ing passion
is strong in death with most of the ladies who are
prematurely buried behind the convent walls. For
instance, we have never yet heard of a “Sister”
Jemima Ann, and we would joyfully walk ten
miles over a newly macadamized road with dried
Eeas in our boots to catch one glance of a Lady
uperioress who willingly styled herself Susan
Jane. Au contraire, however, we read that Miss
Bridget Muldoon is “ in religion,” Sister Maroelli-
anus Eraerentiana of the Holy Cross ; Miss Polly
Potts is Sister Alphonse de Ugourl of the Passion ;
Miss Johanna O’Rourke is Sister San Vlncenzio
Bonaventura Anselmo du Sacre Cceur, and so on
to the end of this most aesthetic chapter Another
peculiarity is that the novices invariably assume
names belonging to the male persuasion, which
seems to imply they are slightly dissatisfied with
the sex allotted to them. But they do great good
in their own gentle, self-sacrificing way, and so we
can well forgive them tbis-apparently their only
little weakness.
There is a kind of society of ladies now in
London—of course a high society—who are in-
veterate players of American poker. Those who
understand this subtle, deceptive game will see

played higher than she could pay, and m one last
desperate endeavour she staked herself, bhe lost.
A PARAGON.
Her forehead it is smooth and white.
Her cheeks are rosy red.
Her coiled hair is glossy bright
And smooth upon her head.
And yet no hair-dye does she use.
No powder uses she—
On cheeks and lips the rosy hues
Will never faded be.
Her face is pleasant and serene.
She weaves no wicked wile;
No tits of frowning Intervene
Between the smile and smile.
No giddy girl. Indeed, is she.
By foolish fancies fed—
No sort, of gilded gaiety
Would ever turn her head.
Who is she ? When we tell you this,
Feel how your little axe works.
This paragon of females is
A figure in the Waxworks!
Writes the Bishop of LendonFulham
Palace, November 14, 1883. Sir, I beg to acknow-
ledge your letter of the 13th inst. I have seen Mr.
Handcock, who distinctly and indignantly denies
the charge, which appears to rest solely on the
statement of Mrs. Thomas. It Is, therefore, a case
not capable of investigation, and I have advised
Mr. Handcock that it will be his duty, in order to
clear his character, to briuir an action against you
and Mrs. Thomas if the charge is repeated. I need
not remind you that the penalty for making the
above accusation is severe.—I am, sir, your obedi-
ent. J. London. Mr. TT. C. B. Thomas.” Hand-
cock is the Vicir of St. Matthew's and Christ
Church, Hammersmith Notwithstanding his dis-
tinct and indignant denial, he has been committed
tor trial for indecently assaulting a Mrs. Thomas.
She is vounar —sweet 18 —aod comel> - It was Hand-
cock who joined herself and Thomas in marriage
on the 8tn November. Next day he called and
asked her to come to the parsonage for some
tracts. When she called (this is her statement) he
put his arm round her dear little waist and led her
to the drawing-room. In cross-examination, she
admitted that “ My clergyman where I attended
was always in the habit of putting his arms on our
shoulders and round our necks when he spoke to
us ” There 1 One thing we will always regret—
that wo didn’t -tick to «be church when we had a
chance, and not wander off into 1'terature. But it
is the Bishop's letter that is the real bonne bnuche
of the whole affair. “ It is, therefore, a case not
capable of investigation,” and I need not re-
mind you that the penalty for making th« above
accusation is severe!” Of course it is. But then
there’s a penalty for provino it also; and, in the
latter case, it is not Thomas and his wife who will
have to pay it.
Law and Justice exhibit queer anomalies.
Thus, at the Gundagai Sessions, the other day, we
learn that one Foster, for horsestealing, was dis-
charged, owing to the prosecutor being unable to
attend, in consequence of detention by a bush
fire. Hence, as long as a prosecutor is prevented
from personally nttendiog at Court, by fair means
or foul, the greatest criminal may escape. This
opens up a wonderful field for the now omnipotent
hoodlum.
It is a well-proven fact that Friday is an'
unlueky day to start on any venture of import-
ance, and there is a young man somewhere about
the Nepean district to-day who is by no means
likely to forget this all-important fact. It appears
that this rural masher was the principal spirit in
organizing a private picnic up the river, and the
gay party chose the Friday in Christmas week for
the outing. Shortly after lunch Mr. Masher
started otf to show the ladies how Hanlan beat
Trickett, but before ho had done a mile his skiff
capsized, and stood him on his head in the most
ignominious manner one cap imagine. In his
wild endeavours to right the boat he wrenched his
foot in a snag, and sent his hat and a valuable
watch and chain to the bottom of the river also.
After a desperate struggle, in which his pants
were reefed from Dan to Bersheeba and halt-way
back again, he struck th« bank, and was hobbling
across a paddock to repair the wreck, when an un-
friendly bull went for him, and caused him to shin
up an adjacent tree with a facility quite sur-
prising on the part of one so young. The branch
he perched on, however, broke, and his wrist was
badly bruised; but the bull pressed his attention*
so closely that Hanlan’s exponent had to make for
a fence, and hastily springing over this he safely
landed in the vile-smelling waters of a beastly
trench. From this he emerged just in time to
notice a search party of friends coming straight
across in pursuit of him; but as he happened to be
divested of the best part of his clothes at the time,
the searchers deemed it advisable to stroll down
to the bank once more until their lost friend had
wrung the slime out of his shirt, and repaired his
pants by the aid of a Novelty-shop knife and strips
otf his best handkerchief. Thinas are quiet now,
but Mr. Masher will start no more holiday trips on
Fridays.
It is a halcyon time for murderers in Eng-
land just now. Marwood’s successor is not yet
thoroughly aufait with the more intricate details
of his art, and, consequently, is not able to give
satisfaction even to the man ho hangs. It is said
that this is the reason that the gentleman who
murdered his five children at Walthamstow, the
other day, got reprieved. If our own Mr, Howard
were to die (which the saints forbid!), and our
Government had such delicate scruples, what a
gay old gory time we should have here, to be sure!
Woolloomooloo would riot in carnage, and Water-
loo would revel in new and unnatural crimes.
And, by the way, where is Mr. Howard ? We have
heard very little of him lately. Perhaps he is lay-
ing low for a C.M.G -ship. We see no reason why
he shouldn't get it. He has our recommendation,
anyhow. Talking of hangmen, they say there is
a mysterious fascination in the hangman’s busi-
ness; so much so, that a hangman will not change
his proiession for any other. We can almost
understand this. It must be one of the rare joy*
of this earth to put a rope round the necks of
some people. But, passing from the aesthetic (we
can venture to use this word again, now that it
has become unfamiliar to the mouths of barbers
and barmaids) view of the question, we have a
suggestion to make. It is that two gigantic gal-
lows clocks be erected with the fines received from
larrikins—one at Waterloo, the other at Woolloo-
mooloo—the pendulums to consist of such gentle-
men as those who assisted in the little tragic en-
tertainments given in those charming suburbs
lately. The other younir gentlemen of the neigh-
bourhood would be able to time their stolen
watches by these. If we had our way, they would
never lack pendulums while the larrikin popula-
tion held out. But we haven’t our way. Conse-
quently, we expect to see some of these same
youths legislating for us one of these days.
Some few years ago in a neighbouring
colony, a banker’s clerk, whom we will call Bull-
more, for the simple reason that Bullraore isn’t
his name, entered into partnership with an old
storekeeper of the place, whose account at the
bank was overdrawn a few hundred pounds. The
object of the partner-ship was clearly to put this
matter right, but Mr. Bullmore’s experience in
the bank had grounded him so thoroughly in
finance that having fixed up matters satisfactorily
with regard to the few hundreds in question, he
immediately launched into fresh business of a
wholesale nature, in which he was able to employ
the bank’s money on a vastly extended scale.
His partner, the old storekeeper, was greatly
pleased with the turn affairs had taken, and
looked on the junior member of the firm with
leelings of admiration, wonder, and delight min-
f led up together like mixed pickles in a bottle,
n a very short time the overdraft of the new
firm amounted to a great many more thousands
than the few hundreds he himself had previously
owed. It was this old gentleman’s delignt of a
Saturday night to surreptitiously abstract the
bank pass book from the safe where Mr. Bullmorc
most carefully kept.it, and take it home with him
to show his wife. "Look at that now,
Maria!’’ he would say, opening the book and
pointing to the debtor balance pencilled
on the page containing the latest entries.
"There now. Maria dear, look at that
now? What do you think of that fora hover-
draft? £15 000! And when you an’me used to
want a ten-pun-note, blowed if they’d let us have
it! Ah, that's the beauty of good book-keepin’ I’’
For many years the firm prospered greatly, be-
coming, in fact, the largest importers in that part
of the colony. The old gentleman retired at last
with a handsome fortune, and on account of his
extensive knowledge of the rudiments of the
English language he was immediately raised to
the peerage of the Legislative Assembly of the
colony, and, as a politician and legislator, took
first honours every time. Mr. Bullmore in the
meantime launched into heavier speculations, but
the bank at last gave out, and he had to surrender
his estate to his creditors, with liabilities princi-
pally due to merchants in various places, which
figured up to the " demn’d total ” of half a million
sterling. His late partner, however, whose
fortune was safe, and whose admiration for his
young friend had never abated, backed him up to
buy back the estate, which he did, for 5s. in the £,
and he is once more one of the most nourishing
merchants in New Guinea. Moral: Alwaysget
a big overdraft—when you can. Banks have no
patience with small ones.

VANITY FAIR.
A sudden und almost epidemic whim in
America Is for ladies to adorn their hats with cats’
heads. A pretty little white kitten’s head peeping
furtively out of a mass of feathers or leaves is by
uo means ungraceful, the fixed, earnest eyes hav-
ing a curious effect. What becomes of the n-sidue
of the cat, when the milliner gets its head, is un-
certain; but twopenny “rabbit pies” are now
reduced to a penny — The custom of “theatre
parties,” which seems so pleasant and sensible in
theory, is thus spoken of by one who has suffered
from them in Now York:—“Every night the prin-
cipal theatres are al-Hict .'d by three or four theatre
parties. Each numbers from, say,
people up to thirty; they take the best rows of
Seats, and chattorand oriticise the play all through
in loud and merry tones. When you are one of a
theatre party, you enjoy yourself, and look on the
rest of the audience with supercilious pity. It is
when you drop into a theatre alone and sit
beside a theatre party that you realise what
a nuisance well-bred people can sometimes
make of themselves in public places.” A fashion
paper writes: “Shoes are still worn very low."
To be shoe-r they are. Who ever heard of
them being worn high—?ay, on the proboscis or
the cranial bump of self-esteem ?....Fashionable
girls in London now-adays go about the streets
witli big dogs with collars on them, or puppies
with collars on them — Scotchmen, they say, can’t
see a joke. And yet a Scotch paper announced:
“ Preparations are being made to receive the
Queen at Balmoral, several tradesmen having
received orders to be immediately executed."
" Yes," eompiaoentiy observed a
fond mother, “ 1 think M«ud has made a very
good match. 1 hear that her husband is one of
the shrewdest and most unprincipled lawyers
in the profession, and of course he can afford
to gratify her every wish. Delightful, isn’t It?”...
Many brides now carry up to the altar, instead of
a bouquet, a prayer book bound in white velvet
and gold—A novelty is tho literary bracelet,
made of twelve tiny gold or silver books attached
by a double chain, each bearing a favourite
author’s name. The musical bracelet bears com-
posers’ names... At the Photo. Club Ball, Brighton

Many scandals have occurred through women
attempting to blackmail men In London. There
are some termini noted as the resorts of pre-
datory women, who infest them with the special
object of pouncing on any likely prey. They pick
out well-known men, often elderly ones, ascertain
their business, residence and movements, and lay
cleverly organised traps for them. A bold charge
was lately made by one of these women against a
London magistrate of h igh repute, but it failed...
A man, who is a candidate for the office ot school
superintendent in Iowa, is being opposed by his
wife, who is also a candidate. According to latest
accounts, she had given the “ole man ” fits on the
hustings, and bade fair to “leather” him “hands
down.’’ Doubtless, she had likewise leathered
him “ hands up ” many a lime before
It was tried to prevent the holding of the notori-

They were so attractively naughty that the men
who couldn’t get away from their wives and

gambling hells in Melbourne, too many influential

Steam Launch presented to Christopher
Newton, Esq.
The sketch on this page represents the steam
yacht presented to Mr. Christopher Newton by a
number of British manufacturers and merchants.
The cause of the presentation has boon al eady
alluded to, but will bear further reference. Years
ago, owing to the drawing of numerous bills by
the home partner, Mr. Newton suddenly found his
commercial progress stopped by the uncomfort-
able words, “ No thoroughfare." There was no-
thing for It but to " compound,” and I5s. In the £
performed the double office of satisfying the credi-
tors and leaving Mr. Newton with undimiuished
hopes but crippled resources. Success, pro-
nounced and uninterrupted, was the result of his
next start, until, a couple of years ago, he visited
England, where he expended £40,QUO in settling old
liabilities that had been long since wiped oil',
leually. And novv you know why the merchants
presented him with a beautiful steam yacht, and
his wife with diamonds. The yacht was put together
in Sydney—at Mr. Dunn's yards, berry’s Bay—
and the machinery obtained from Paisley,
she is one of the trimmest boats in Port Jack-
son An inscription onasilver plate tells us that;—
This Steam Banach (accompanied by a diamond
ring and silver bracelet for Mrs. Newton) was pre-
sented to Christopher Newton, Esq., by a number
of British manufacturers and merchants, as a mark
of their sincere esteem, and of their deep sense of
his honourable dealings with them during a long
and arduous commuicial career.—John Scott (ou
behalf of the subscribers). Oct. 19,1882.” And so
we trust that lor many years he and his (we are
speaking ot the Newtons now) will derive as much
pleasure from their launch as their fellow-citizens
derive irom having among them men whose stand-
ard of commercial morality differs in some im-
poitunt particulars from—others.
There are two giant intellects down Mo-
ruya way, that are very much troubled about the
purport of creation. They give vent to their
trouble in exceedingly troubled rhyme. One of
them hints, one week, that he has a dark doubt
about the wisdom of the cosmic plan, and the
other clears it up for him the next week. The
medium of this interesting discussion is the
Moritya Examiner — a paper which, we may say,
is invariably characterised by a lofty moral loi e
and supernaturally bad spefilng. it appears one
of these pensive mastodons is known as “the
Bard of Broulee.” To him the other bard:—
“ The loneliness you must endure
May bring a more sorrowful mood;
An exchange of our thoughts, I am sure,
Will result in a mutual good.”
We can quite believe it. The thoughts of neither
of them will ever do any harm. And, judging by
the following (from the Bard of Broulee), the
exchange seems to be a fair one. Hear him: —
“ This infernal vampire of my soul
Has stolen from me my thought, my all;
And has left me, in its fiendish glee,
A mere boot-jack for humanity,”
If he is a hoot-jack -which wo do not doubt, as he
writes like a boot-jack—ho should be better ac-
quainted with teetthan his verses show him to be.
But, as ho says himself :—
“ Had I fallen in with better fate,
To have known the sciences of late.
Then, with many of the day, I may
Have serious, startling things to say.”
This, of course, is modesty. We have no doubt
Darwin would have deemed it j jy to have known
him. In fact, he was always on the look-out for
him, was Darwin, We are putting the ca«e gently.
But though the Bard of Broulee had been an en-
cyclopaedia, he could not have produced anything
more startling than his poetry. Here is his vale-
dictory veise to the other bard:
“ Adieu — Christman joy* shall chase away
The bitter thoughts ot the bygone day,
But like the waves of a stormy main,
Shall too quickly heave in sight again.”
Wo have done the underlining, as the author evi-
dently forgot it. The “quickly heave” is, no
doubt, a delicate reference to the goose-stuffing,
which, with whisky and that issue of the Moruya
Examiner, we may take to constitute the "Christ-
mas joys.” By the way, we had nearly forgotten
the “infernal vampire of his soul.” He should
take an emetic for this. Ho has evidently swal-
lowed a frog at some time or other, and it is mov-
ing about inside him. This is what causes nil his
trouble about the plans of Providence. And now
a word of advice—in rhyme, as they will probably
take it better that way- to the “ Bard of Broulee ”
and ms despondent friend:—
O, bards give up your cares!
You were never made to think;
You were made to eat and drink,
Drink rum, eat Irish stew -
God will take care of His own affairs,
The devil will see to you.
We have a small book called “ The Two
Spirits, and other Poems.” The others are two.
“ Innocence ” is a weak little pastoral; and “ Ponte
Moro ” is a ballad about one Caliph Abdarahman
Ledinalla in ancient Grenada. Wo don’t see why
any man should print this in Sydney—especially as
R is not worth printing 1 anywhere. “The Two
Spirits ” is a piece of seventeen pages, describing
how, to use the author’s opening words,
“ There is a legend of the Rhine
That’s slipped between the gaps of time.”
It would be of no interest, even if it were well
written: but it Is not. In syntax, grammar, and
rhyme, it is full of faults. It’s the old mistake of
rushing into poetry while there’s plenty of room
for wrestling with pothooks.
AFTER MANY YEARS.
Young I was, and my heart beat high
With the hope that is born of youth;
A ?xr L ttie s P ai 'kle of passion it lighted mine eye,
When that optic tirst lighted on Ruth.
The maiden was fair, and her golden brown hair
Grew long and luxuriant-ice ;
Close, in clusters. It elung to her shoul iera bare—
And Ruthie clung close to me.
Old, I am, and my heart don’t beat
As it used to, some years ago;
I suffer the tortures of gout in my feet,
And my hair is as driven snow.
Ruth, likewise, is old, and for hair of gold
«he weareth a wig instead;
Rut, spite of her age, she’s a terrible scold—
1 wish I was cold— and dead.
A most interesting exemplification of the
way in which the gaols of the world arc tilled
■ comes trom a distant land; but there *s, wo Jcar
very little reason to travel far irom home lor such
a record. It appears that from a young hoodlum i
girl named “ Margaret’’—who was left adrift in a
village on the Hudson 70 yeats ago, and to grow
up as best she could—have descended 200 criminals.
1“ o* 16 single generation there were 20 children ;
of these nine served in the State prisons an aggre- i
gate term of fifty years, while the others were
frequent inmates of gaols and penitentiaries. The
whole number of this girl s descendants through
six generations is 900. 200 are on record as crimi-
nals, a large number idiots. Imbeciles, drunkards,
lunatics, prostitutes, aud paupers. How many
Margarets have we here who are on the right wav
to follow up the deeds of their Hudson sister.
The Bishop of Bombay recently ordered a
clergyman to discontinue administering the sacra-
ment to some poor devil of a sinner who had
repented and reformed, but had not made a public
confession of his sins, as the Bishop thought he
should have done. His Lordship evidently thinks
the angels who have “more Joy over one sinner.’’
&c., are easily amused. Perhaps he is right; but,
t hen, he should remember that they have not h d
the same advantages of education' as he has had.
If we were a Bishop, we should think of the angels
kindly, and make allowances for their defective
culture. It is onlv too apparent, however, that
his Lucifershlpof Bombay will, when he goes aloft,
quarrel with the cherub choir about the colour of
their wings, if he thinks they look too gaudy or
ritualistic.
A determined man can do anything. We
were reading the other day of a fowl-fancier, who
had some rare eggs hatching, and found the hen
dead on the nest one fine morning. Did this dis-
courage him ? Not a bit. He just pulled on bis
nightcap, went to bed and hatched them himself.
Now, if any accident should happen to the Vice-
regal fowls. Lord Gussy has only to put up his
finger to have the hatching finished in a similar
way. Wo know a man who would be proud to do
it. Even to be the Viceregal sitting-hen would
satisfy him, failing higher offices. And, by the way,
this human incubation idea suggests to us a use
for the members of the Legislative Council. They
are always sitting and doing nothing ; why not
therefore sit on eggs and be of some use to the
country ? And, thunder, wouldn’t it be a gigantic
idea to get, say, John Lucas to sit on a moa’s egg
and hatch it!
Mr. Gladstone went out with his little axe
and cut down another tree, the other day. This
performance was witnessed by a select party of
friends, and the information was telegraphed all
over the country. We have cut down gnarlier
trees than ever grew round Hawarden, and
grubbed stumps that would Allan average English
county, and yet nobody ever took the trouble to
telegraph the fact round for the information of
Europe. There is something uneven about all
this, but what it is we don’t just see. The fact,
however, is apparent to us that wo are neglected.
We believe it we were to go out and cut down a
town councillor, no notice would be taken of the
occurrence—except, perhaps, the casual notice of
the individual cut down. We have a good mind to
try it. We cut down a dead Chinaman from a tree
once. Even he took no notice of us. Real merit
is always overlooked In this world.

Swiss Commissioner’s Speech.
Extract from a speech delivered at the Amphi-
theatre of the Primary College of La Chaux-de-
Fonds, Tuesday, the 14th day of November, 1876,
by M. Edouard Favre-Perrel, Swiss Commissioner
and juror to the Philadelphia Exhibition:—
On the Waltham “ Riverside ” Watch.
. . . . “The Waltham Company make the
entire watch—from the first screw to the case and
dial. It would even be difficult for them to use
our products, so great is the regularity, so minute
the precision, with which their machines work
They arrive at the regulation of the watch—so to
say—without having seen it. When the watch is
given to the adjuster, the foreman delivers to him
the corresponding hair-spring and the watches
regulated. (Sensation among the audience.) Here
is what 1 have seen, gentlemen I I asked from the
director of the Waltham Company, a watch of the
fifth grade. A large safe was opened before me;
at random I took a watch out of it and fastened it
to my chain. The director, having asked me to
let him have the watch for two or three days, so
as to observe the motion. I answered, ‘ On the con-
trary, i persist in wearing it just as it is. to obtain
an exact idea of your manufacture.’ At Paris, I set
my watch by a regulator on the Boulevard, and on
the sixth day I observed that it had varied 3){
seconds. And this watch is of the fifth American
grade; it cost 75 francs (movement without case).
At my arrival at Lode, I showed the watch to one
of our first adjusters, who asked permission to
‘ take it down ’—in other words, to take it to
pieces. I, however, wished first to observe it; and
here is the result, which I noted: Hanging, daily
variation, 1)4 seconds; variation in different posi-
tions, from 4 to 8 seconds; in the ‘ heated room,
the variation was but very slight. Having thus ob-
served it, 1 handed the watch to the adjuster, who
took it down. After the lapse of a few days, he
came to me and said, word for word: ‘I am com-
pletely overwhelmed; the result is incredible; one
would not find one such watch among 50,000 of our
manufacture.’
“ This watch, gentlemen, 1 repeat to you, I took
at hazard—out of a heap, as we say. You under-
stand, from this example, that the Waltham watch
may be preferred to the Swiss, I have finished,
gentlemen, and I have told you of things such as
I have seen them. It remains for us to profit
from this sad experience, and to improve our
manufacture. Competent men are not wanting
among us; they must go to work at once.”
IA round of applause followed the speaker as ha
descended the tribune.I

AYER’S PILLS,
A large proportion of the diseases which
cause human suffering result from derange-
ment of the stomach, bowels, and liver.
Ayer’s Cathartic Pills act directly upon
these organs, and are especially designed to
cure the diseases caused by their derange-
ment, including Constipation, Indiges-
tion, Dyspepsia, Headache, Dysentery,
and a host of other ailments, for all of
which they are a safe, sure, prompt, and
pleasant remedy. The extensive use of these
Pills by eminent physicians in regular prac-
tice, shows unmistakably the estimation In
which they are held by the medical profes-
sion.
These Pills are compounded of vegetable
substances only, and are absolutely free from
calomel or any other injurious ingredient.
A Sufferer from Headache writes :
“Ayer’s Pills are invaluable to me, and
are my constant companion. I have been
a severe sufferer from Headache, and your
Pills are the only thing 1 could look to
for relief. One dose will quickly move my
bowels and free my head from pain. They
are the most effective and the easiest physic
1 have ever found. It is a pleasure to me to
speak in their praise, and 1 always do so
when occasion offers.
W. L. Page, of W. L. Page & Bro.”
Franklin St., Richmond,Ya., June 3,1882.
“I have used Ayer’s Pills in number-
less instances as recommended by you, and
have never known them to fall to accomplish
the desired result. We constantly keep them
on hand at our home, and prize them as a
pleasant, safe, and reliable family medicine.
FOR DYSPEPSIA they are invaluable.
J. T. Hayes.”
Mexia, Texas, June 17,1882.
The Rev. Francis B. Harlowe, writing
from Atlanta, Oa., says: “For some years
past I have been subject to constipation,
from which, in spite of the use of medi-
cines of various kinds, I suffered increasing
inconvenience, until some months ago 1
began taking Ayer’s Pills. They have
entirely corrected the costive habit, and
have vastly improved my general health.”
Ayer’s Cathartic Pills correct irregu-
larities of the bowels, stimulate the appe-
tite and digestion, and by their prompt and
thorough action give tone and vigor to the
whole physical economy.

Gentliimhn,—I respectfully beg leave to bring
under your notice the superior style and fit of our
Trousers, which are cut on the same unerring
principles as those which have made the name of
Hill, Bond-street, a household word amongst the
leaders of fashion in the world’s metropolis.

pearance, perfect freedom either in sitting, riding
or walking ; require neither footstraps nor braces

position in every attitude of the body.
They are designed to fit the corpulent as well .
the slight figure, and are engaged to give to all the
most perfect satisfaction.
A single trial will suffice to establish their claim
on your patronage.

' James Little, who lives up tho country,
and la esteemed a very smart man In that quarter,
brought a few sovereigns down to Melbourne to
put him over a holiday. A cab dropped him in
Bourke-atreet and he tendered one sovereign,
holding his hand for tho change. As each shilling
fell into his palm, James was doing the necessary
counting, but when he said “nineteen,” a little
lad till then unnoticed, grabbed the coins and
struck out for the nearest alley. The chase was
exciting, but James did not see the Jart or tho
coins after. That served him as a subject for de-
scriptive discourse until evening. He then wont
to the Bijou theatre, and while receiving a ticket
at tho window, he felt the purse sliding gently
down from tho breast pocket of his coat. He fol-
lowed it, and, as well as the crowd would lot him
initiated another obaso. This one lasted a Ion*
time, but with the same result as before. Then
the countryman went round his friends and bor-
rowed as much as paid his fare home, and left the
capital at midnight. When asked if he saw the
“Forty Thieves” at the Bijou, he shakes his head
solemnly and says: “Forty? Aye, hundreds. At
the bijou V Aye,everywhere, everywhere.”
We are a very childish generation, after
all. We have discovered—or some of us'have dis-
covered—that intoxicating liquor is Injurious to
the human system. Instead of giving up tho use
of It in an ordinary way, we must band together,
and decorate ourselves with badges, and call each
other right worshipful, and most noble, and the
like. Then the old yearning comes over us, and
we make a feeble compromise with the fiend by
drinking dismal decoctions cunningly com-
pounded for us by the long-headed men who
thrive on our weaknesses. The latest of these is
a beverage known as “ Blue-ribbon Beer. This
Is said to “ resemble in every particular ordinary
beer, being made from malt and hops, and yet
does not contain any alcohol.” Here is puerility
of the puerilest. As if men drank beer because
they were thirsty! As If they drank it to kill
time! They don’t. The underlying principle, the
eternal basis of blbulatlon, is to get drunk. While
temperance societies overlook this fact, they will
never prosper. The only society of this kind that
will succeed will be one which will provide its
members with a beverage upon which they can
get decorously drunk. Such a society would have
a career of triumph before it In Sydney,
This is a solid fact. In a certain town out
somewhere, lately, a lavely wife buried her “ olo
man ” one week, married her daughter “ in stylo ”
tho next, and on tho following one inaugurated a
race meeting at her hotel. Beat that, and “ tram-
ple on the Greek and Homan glory,” ye disconso-
late widows 1
Thus the Wxlcannia Times, in a quite re-
markable paragraph about an iguana 13 or 14
inches long killing a half-grown rabbit“ If an
enigma of that size could kill a half-grown rabbit,
it can easily be understood,” &c. (Wo omit the
remainder of the proportion sura.) Ever since we
first mot KoJy (erst of the Stockwhip) we have
been aware of the capacity of tho far Western
enigma to tackle anything from a rabbit to a
squattah. Moreover, there is yet another reason
why, at least by us, the rabbit-destroying enigma
can never bo regarded as an anomaly—we have
known a simple conundrum to kuock out of time
four Down and Gumtree men.
We think we shall soon give up reading
the English papers. They annoy us. Hero we
have just come across a paragraph about tho
Marquis of Bute. He has four magnificent man-
sions already—Mount Stuart, in the Isle of Bute ;
Cardiff Castle, in Glantnorganshire: Dumfries

he has rented for a term of years—and now he is
building himself another gaudy mansion at
Bilston, near Harrogate. Is tho Marquis of Bute
any hotter than wo are ? Is he as handsome ? Is
he as clever? Is he such a spoiled child of the
Muses ? is he as capable of appreciating a refined
and luxurious life ? Does ho know as much about
the nutritious properties of office paste ? Not by
leagues. And yet here are we living in a threc-
reorner with the bailiff in. There is one comfort,
however; if we have not as many houses as the
Marquis, we move quite as often. And, by the
way, he is said to be building his now houses and
restoring the old ones in accordance with Pugin’s
“ True Principles of Christian Art.” Humph ! The
true principles of Christian art used to bo to live
in a catacomb or a cave in the wilderness, and
give all your goods to the poor. But perhaps
Pugin had original ideas of his own on this sub-
ject. Lots of people have, We haven’t. But
that’s because we are the poor.

To Journalists.
A SATIRE
(After SWIFT.)
[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
Go sell the type, upset tho ink.
The quill destroy, from office slink;
How dare ye write ? Bah! sweep tho street,
A journalist is but a cheat!
For journals scandalously dare
(Even while Sir James is in the chab)
To publish, tor tho public good,
And servo up truthful mental food.
Yo know that juries will not stand
Such truths, sown broadcast through the land;
Why should a juryman decide ?
For ye may prick his horny hide.
Ye write lor gain “Stay, yet for more;
Wo fling wid.- open wisdom’s door;
To rich and poor, to high and low—
We care not which, if iriend or foe;
Why should wo fear ? What should we hood ?
Wo cry aloud: ‘who runs may read I ’
Our motto Is—‘ the pu blio weal I‘
Our satire such, that rogues may feel.
Wo know that only withers wring,
Which dread our lash, or feel our sting!
Cant, vice, and fools, our targets are.
And tolerance our guiding star;
Say, then, what gain we ? Could we not,
With vicious ease, slur, lie, and blot ?
And twice as fast, while vice we nurse.
Fill up with sordid gold our purse ?
Far bo that day, colonial scribes
Shall stab the truth, and pocket bribes,
Connive at crime, stamp honour down.
Or servile creep ’ueath Judge’s frown.
Mansfield arise! We Jive too late;
Where Justice sat is desolate! ”
What stuff! Yo err, so Judges say,
And Juries list, when Judges bray I
If ye but wisdom put within
The Judge's pates, yo cannot sin.
Be wise—and fill, with Bacon’s lore,
What was but emptiness before!
Let then your columns beat the drum,
la praise of Judges, juries—scum;
Applaud the Judge (howe’er so base),
When dealing with a libel case;
And print “ all learning’s but a straw
In contrast with His Honor’s law I ”
Why, then, not gild the horse-hair wig ?
If people chide ye, cry “ A Fig I ”
Ask “ Is it prudent crime to show.
“ When juries, o'er and o’er, say—‘No?
And pat tho juries on tho buck
(Tho’ kennels show a better pack);
Bo crafty, rich, draw tight purse-string.
And lot all villains bavc their fling !
Tom and Ned.
A TALE.
[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
How do, old boy ? Come have a drink; v-
Dost bring to mind past years, old chum,
When wo two fellows knocked about
What! Ned, old man, you don’t like rum?”
“ Ah! times are changed; we’re growing old,
No more we’ll dance and look so frisky;
You’re not cut up so much as I—
Why! what’s up Ned, you won’t try whisky 7’,
•• We’ve had, together, roaring sprees.
Away up North, at Bush Man-traps;
Ah! Ned, those palmy days arc gone.
When nuggets tilled our EhT no schnapps? ’>
“ Say, Ned, art on tho strict Q.T.?
Or, perhaps, you’ve now become a dandy ?
Hi I waiW, fill a good stiff glass
Of I’hewl What! Don’t drink good three-
star brandy ? ”
" I sec. old man, you think that grog
Will cut up rough, and make us queer,
And yet we always freely nipped ”
Oh! Hang it all, f’ou’t say, ‘no beer!’”
’• Why, Ned, you’re changed—you’re not tho mate
W ith whom I’ve Jingled many glasses.
And pitched the yarn, and turned tho whim,
And humped the drum. Ah! So life pasoesi
A year has passed: by winter fire,
Ned sits and thinks of times of yore
Ills thoughts fly back bo shanty spaces,
Ho hears the drunken crowd once more.
Once more ho sees the slobbering mouth,
Hears ribald songs that break tho night;
With reeling limbs before tho bar,
Half-maddened sots yell, swear, and fight.
His head now droops, he murmurs low;
”1 wonder what road poor Tom steers!
I wouldn’t drink when last wo mot—
1 haven’t drank for twenty years.
" Let parsons rant about our souls.
And shriek out—‘on religion think,'
What’s blaitlng mankind, day by da» ?
’Tis cursed, damning, maddening Drink! ’
Aroused, by knocking at tho door.
On opening—there, before Ned’s eye,
Pale, tottering, with white, quivering lips,
Poor Tom, his mate, moans, “Let me die!
“ Why, Tom, old fellow—cheer up, man,
You’ll get all right—then no more glasses;
Tom, dying, answers, “ Ned, don’t drink,
Good-bye, God bless you.” So life pastes.
LIFE INSURANCE.

AN ANTIDOTE FOB. SNAKE BITE.
On snake-bites, an old bushman writes:—“As for antidotes the best known is grog.
When bitten, it he has such good fortune, lot him drink as much grog as he can and as
strong as he can, whilst his friends prevent his going to sleep by walking him about
until dangerous symptoms are past.” This is almost enough to tempt oue, this hot
weather, to indulge in a bite daily. And apropos of this, listen to what a smart Eng-
lish Commercial man says, inter alia, regarding things Australian Brandy is con-
sumed in large quantities by the diggers, who find by taking it in large quantities that
they in time become impervious to the bites of venomous creatures with which the
country is tilled.”
