The Red Page
Aristotle and the Dean
“The nature of man is not what he is
born as,” said Aristotle, the wise old bird,
“but what he is bom for.” The Greek’s
message is a hopeful one and in these days
apt to be forgotten. Our friend the Dean
—it is a tribute to his personality that he
is the only Dean since Swift—has won for
himself a little fame as the clerical Cassan-
dra. We are on the downward path: we
are breeding from the unfit, we are head-
ing straight for moral and physical ruin;
but he offers no remedy.
Calamity-howling is an obsession of our
time. It is so easy, for one thing, and so
many estimable citizens whose youth is
past are certain to shake their heads, sadly
and comfortably agreeing that the present
generation is going to blazes and the next
one to whatever happens afterwards. One
set. of the howlers, seeing that the increas-
ing comforts of civilisation and the
advance of medical and other sciences have
made modern life much easier and there-
fore i'ffter, raise their wail on that account.
The obvious remedy would be to abandon
education, drop science and retrogress to
the aboriginal phase. As, however, the urge
to progress is inherent in man, the civilis-
ing process would simply begin all over
again, and in time we should find ourselves
back at the point from which we had gone
into reverse gear—that is, if some charit-
able neighbor had not taken advantage of
the backslide to push us still further rear-
ward or wipe us out altogether.
As to “breeding from the unfit,” according
to Mr. S. H. Smith, Director of Education
in N.S.W., about three-quarters of one per
cent, of children here have imperfect mental
development, and this corresponds witli
the findings of investigators in Britain and
elsewhere. While it is quite right to see
what we can do with this three-quarters of
one per cent., is it reasonable that society
should be called on to tremble in its shoes
because of the existence of the piteous per-
centage?
Most of the apostles of hopelessness are.
really victims of the Galtonian creed, that
“a child’s being is irrevocably determined
by nature,” and environment counts for
nothing. As a matter of fact, a child’s
environment is part of his inheritance, and
a bad environment is found in homes much
more pretentious than the slums. The old
argument about the relative importance of
environment as opposed to heredity is no
longer worth wasting breath about: if a
child has consumptive tendencies and is
dragged up in a poverty-stricken slum, no
doubt he will develop tuberculosis; if he
is well fed, with plenty of sunshine and
fresh air, he probably won’t. The same is
true of mental tendencies. That wise in-
stitution, the Roman Catholic Church, has
long recognised this by making every sacri-
fice to catch its recruits young. If the Dean
wants a better England he ought to lead a
campaign for abolition of the slums, for
giving to every man a trade or calling
which will enable him to do decently with
his life, for furnishing an education, of
mind or hand or both, suited to the sub-
ject. All this may mean for England Pro-
tection, or emigration or some other plan—
the finding of the plan is the job of her
statesmen and sociologists; but a mere
helpless emphasising of an obvious evil,
with the apparent assumption that the
evil is irremediable, will cure nothing.
Even the mating of feeble-minded is not
the inevitable disaster it may seem. Says
Professor Jennings, of the Johns Hopkins
University (Prometheus; Kegan-Paul):
“If both parents have the corresponding
pairs of the packets of chemicals on which
development depends defective in the
same manner, then their children will be
all defective like the parents. But if, as
may well happen, the feeble mind is due
to defects in different packets in both par-
ents, then all experimental breeding shows
that the two parental stocks may supple-
ment one another so that the defect will
not appear in the offspring No pair of
parents has a sure thing in the high char-
acter of their prospective offspring. There
are few parents among those who are not
in the definitely pathological group of
whom it can be predicted that their child-
ren must be worthless.”
If man, then, is on the downward' path,
it is his own fault. The remedy is in his
own hands. _ “Not what he is born as,
but what he is born for”—with this glori-
ous device embroidered on his banners let
him move forward to new achievement,
marching to the drums of ancient wisdom,
rather than faltering to listen to and
tremble at the croakings of the modem
ravens on their barren trees.
P. O’FARRELL.
The Next War to End War
Whatever else the last war did, it did
not teach the prophets to refrain from
describing what the next war will be like.
Before 1914 a library of books, a substan-
tial portion written by people supposed to
be experts, gave advance descriptions of
Armageddon—as it was not. Kitchener,
who could put several volumes into a
phrase, proved the most reliable prophet:
he said, "I do not know when the war will
end, byt it will not-begin. until May.” And
there had been already some substantial
skirmishes before he said that. A little
affair like Mons, for instance.
The one thing which seems definitely
settled by the rapidly growing new crop
of books is that a new war is inevitable.
The Remaking of Modern Armies (John
Murray; Angus and Robertson) does not
even think it worth while to consider the
possibility that there may not be a new
war. The author, Captain B. H. Liddell
Hart, is concerned about showing that the
machine age in warfare, which the writers
long before 1914 proclaimed, has definitely
arrived; and, arguing that the long dead-
lock in the war of 1914-18 was the result of
a mistaken dependence upon infantry he
scraps old battle principles as obsolete.
In the war of the future knighthood will
again be in flower, but the knights will be
light-armored cars capable of great speed,
and therefore a poor target for the heavy
guns alone capable of putting them out of
action; they will run through opposition
as the mailed knight ran through the un-
arniored soldiers. The mobility of these
and similar engines of war will introduce
new tactical methods. The object will be
to break through the helpless masses of
the enemy in order to throw them, how*
ever numerous, into confusion by a para-
lysis of the nerve centres. And whilst this
is happening to the armies, bombs and
chemical warfare, carried right into the
cities and administrative centres of the
opposing country, will destroy the morale
of the whole nation so that it will be glad
of peace under any conditions. The doc-
trine of Napoleon, that the aim should be
the destruction of the main mass of the
opposing army, Captain Hart says is all
wrong; his contention is that it is far
better to aim at the heart than tear the
muscles, which will be useless when the
heart is settled. And he asserts that
the Allied victory was far more the
result of the breakdown of command and
staff control than a collapse of the fight-
ing forces. Foch was planning, he says,
for a tank attack on the command centres
in just the way suggested by this book
when the armies’ successes—infantry suc-
cesses, it may be said, in parenthesis—made
the new plans unnecessary.
Captain Hart has studied the new
engines of war, both machine and chemical,
and his descriptions of them are as interest-
ing as his theories are arresting. But he
seems to have been unduly impressed (just
as before 1914 other expert investigators
were unduly impressed) by the experimen-
tal use of some of the machines on Lark
Hill. He saw light tanks leaping over
rough fields and through tangled woodland
at a big speed, and he judged them invin-
cible when tests showed that hits scored on
them were one in 22 rounds. He points
out that in naval gunnery practice before
the war 75 per cent, of hits were registered;
in battle the hits fell to per cent.
Ascribing this to nervous tension and other
battle conditions, he quotes it as an argu-
ment for almost entire immunity for his
pet machines in actual war. The argument
is unfortunate. The depreciation in effici-
ency in battle did not apply only to gun-
nery, but w r as apparent in all the machinery
introduced wfith exultation.
This disappointment dates back to ancient
history; a sufficiently remote instance, how-
ever, is the Armstrong battery, which, tested
in England, was regarded as certain to cause
demoralisation to any enemy. One was
sent to the New Zealand war under a keen
artillery officer; the other went to China
The former officer was killed whilst
leading an assault on a Maori pah after his
battery had failed to reduce it; the Chinese
battery was equally a failure. Only these
two were ever made. But the battlefields of
the Great War were strewn with victory-
winning devices which not only failed to
win victory, but often did worse damage
to the user than to the enemy. Equally
the devices—including tanks —of both sides
failed to live up to their test reputations.
The “bombing of centres of population and
administration” was equally a failure.
The author is not quite accurate about
the finish of the war, either. The increas-
ing number of the American forces spurred
the Germans to a determination to force a
decision. They got their blow in first; be-
hind the British lines the hurried prepara-
tion of hospital accommodation for a mil-
lion wounded indicated the big scale of the
operations the High Command itself had in
mind. Jettisoning the old principle that
had led to a deadlock, the German attack
started with the instruction, “The minimum
objective must be the enemy’s artillery
positions,” thus throwing out of action the
guns which hitherto had had “the bead” on
captured trenches where, according to the
old idea, the victorious forces had to solidify
their position before a new advance was
made. The German tactics—still relying on
an almost purely infantry push—came
within an ace of success; and when the
British made their attack—again an almost
purely infantry push—they adopted the
same tactics. Their little extra bit of suc-
cess came because the enemy had suffered

HAROLD MERCER.
The Pseudo-Lawson
If every township has its oddish old man
who is said to be the survived Dan Kelly,
surely another survival is the übiquitous
myth of Lawson. It goes this way: I heard
it once again just the other day. “Yes,
Lawson was here in Blankboro a good many
years ago. I often saw him when I was a
kid. Sleeper-getting he was, and he swung
the axe with the best. Then at night, in
the pub bar, he used to recite his poetry,
yards and stacks of it, never ran short. His
looks? Why, I remember him as if it was
yesterday. Big broad chap with sandy hair
and a reddish beard and blue eyes”
Exit that particular Lawson, for me at least,
though I didn’t argue with the speaker. Let
him enjoy his memories and re-read his
Lawson with the intonations of the “author”
he remembers.
Suddenly, though, I realised that this
pseudo-Lawson who turned up everywhere
for so long has given rise to all sorts of
myths apart from the redness of Lawson’s
hair. Lately I followed a newspaper con-
troversy in which one side said that Lawson
never knew the bush except for two short
trips out west, while the other swore that
he not only knew the bush up and down,
but also was a super-bushman—bullocky,
sleeper-getter, what you will! I would sug-
gest that both sides were wrong. First, these
who assert that he was a super-bushman
have probably witnessed or heard of the
feats of one or more pseudo-Lawsons. A
good many of these feats, tacked together,
would build up a heroic legend. The
sleeper-getting Lawson plus the bullock-
driving Lawson plus the horse-breaking
Lawson would combine to make a very per-
sonable whole.
On the other hand, Lawson was a bush-
man, if it is enough for a man to know
the bush as he knows his own face and
hands. Most of his adult life was spent in
towns, but what of his childhood and boy-
hood? Everyone knows they were not
urban. And it is the childhood that counts,
after all. Take the case of a writer like the
South African Pauline Smith, for instance,
who left for England when she was 12.
No one hesitates to take her seriously as a
writer about back-country life, though, as
Arnold Bennett points out, it is the life of
her childhood. Again, Katherine Mansfield
only found her real theme when she decided
to write about her childhood in Maori-
land. No, Lawson’s association with the
bush did not consist of his few deliberate
visits to it as a man. Those visits helped
him to generalise and gave him broad out-
lines, outlines that he could never have
filled in if he had not seen the life, as a
child, steadily from within. He was at least
as good a bushman as any pseudo-Lawson.
N.Q.
Toby and the Drama
Stage-drama, according to Reg. S.
Ellery (R.P. l/12/’27), is a kind of glori-
fied Punch and Judy show in which each
man finds the relief his heart desires. This
sounds clever, but one has merely to prick
beneath the surface of words to see its
pointlessness. In the first place, no man
(except perhaps a hen-pecked husband)
could find anything elevating in the cyni-
cal tale of the murdering Punch; in the
second place, drama (I mean genuine
great drama) doesn’t care a twopenny
damn for the people’s dreams: if the audi-
ence finds anything inspiring in the play
they have stumbled on it by accident,
and the author had no ulterior motive of
popularity in placing it there. All Dr.
Ellery’s remarks are perfectly correct if
applied to musical comedies and cheap
melodramas with their inevitable ingredi-
ents of lasciviousness, legs, red-nosed
comedians and moral texts; when applied
to art, he talks nonsense.
What did the Irish public find so elevat-
ing in Synge’s “Playboy of the Western
World” when they wrecked the theatre?
They saw themselves as they really were,
through the eyes of a merciless poet;
they saw the basic animal lurking in the
fairy-haunted peasant, and immediately let
that animal come to life with a vengeance.
Where are the pretty sentiments that Dr.
Ellery talks so much of to be W id here?
And even Dr. Ellery, I hope, would con-
fess the “Playboy” to be one of the great-
est modern dramas. Then there is Las-
celles Abercrombie’s “Phcenix,” the tale of
a libidinous little girl, a lust-tormented
king, a boasting prince and a mother who
would sacrifice her son to win back her
husband’s love—a great work of art told
in incomparable blank verse, but no pan-
derer to mob sentiments. No, the great
dramatist writes, like all great artists, be-
cause he must write; he tells of the world
he knows, of unconquerable emotions, of
hate, of love, and of man himself tangled
in the hopeless web of passion and circum-
stance.
Dr. Ellery, to prove his argument, makes
the really astounding statement that
Shakspeare was a commonplace philoso-
pher who “spoke mob sentiments with a
golden tongue.” Let us reverse that state-
ment and say that the mob has spoken
Shakspeare’s golden sentiments. Certainly
Shakspeare is now an anthology of
cliches, but that is not his fault. When he
wrote them they were startlingly new;
the} 7 have been made banal by after gener-
ations parroting his genius. And as for
Shakspeare writing with the deliberate in-
tent to delude his audience into the belief
that they were beautiful, and to salve
their petty hurts and worries, one has only
to read “Troilus and Cressida,” “Antony
and Cleopatra” and “Twelfth Night” to see
the absurdity of such a statement. Here,
pricked with merciless pins, are held up
for our ridicule all the weaknesses of man
and woman; the eternal j ill-flirt of a Cressida
who has made every youth’s heart break
from the beginning of time with her
duplicity and her tormenting loveliness and
cruelty; the weak, futile Antony webbed
in the remorseless agony of jealousy; Cleo-
patra, who no sooner mourns the death of
the man she loves than she garbs herself
to capture the conquering Octavius; Mai-
volio, that shameless epitome of man’s
conceit. What noble, elevating texts can
be snipped from here? Where are the
wraiths of Punch and Judy in such a world
of vivid realism?
I agree with Dr. Ellery that the dramatist
should not be a preacher, but neither should
he be a fairy-story teller, fantastically
clothing man’s dreams. He should write
psychologically and, if possible, beautifully.
That is the aim of all fine minds, whether
they write for the stage or for the book-
stalls. The Harold Bell Wrights and Elinor
Glyns of the world are popular because they
are liars. They tell man that he is a pure,
noble animal, and to teach this idiotic lesson
they spice their tales with svelte, slant-eyed
vampires who administer burning kisses. It
is for the great novelists to tell bravely of
life as it is, of courage against merciless
odds, of the occasional—the heartbreakingly
occasional —happinesses that wait by the
roadside while disaster lurks round the
corner. They give life as it truly is, not as
it should be or as the people like to think
it is. So, too, with the great dramatists
from Shakspeare to Synge and Abercrombie.
Punch and Judy is not a good simile for
Dr. Ellery, for that at basis is a cruel and
highly immoral play—but it is unpsycho-
logical, and there it suits his text. The
only actor in that company is Toby, for
being a dog, and therefore highly emotional
and charming, he is .a vital piece of life.
Punch and Judy are merely effigies, and the
great dramatist has no time for such truck;
he would show us the heroic qualities of
Toby before he would erect puppets for the
audience to laugh at or weep about.

A Book About a Gentleman
A determined request from Alan Mickle
(R.P. 15/12/’27) that Australian authors
should write about the cultured element
among our early settlers rouses once more
the question why people don’t read the
books that are written and published. I
have in mind, that is to say, a novel that
corresponds very closely indeed to Alan
Mickle’s desires. It is simply that well-
known but apparently well-neglected tri-
logy “The Fortunes of Richard Mahony,”
of which the third volume is nearly due.
The first two appeared at longish intervals,
and each became buried in the novels
of its year; so it is to be hoped that the
publisher, Heinemann, will see fit to send out
the trilogy in one of those fatly-satisfying
volumes that appear fairly often nowadays—
Galsworthy’s “Forsyte Saga,” for instance,
and R. H. Mottram’s “Spanish Farm” tri-
logy.
Richard Mahony was an educated man,
living with difficulty “on Ballarat” in the
'fifties, where he finally practised as a doctor.
Later on he was in Melbourne, entering into
musical and intellectual life as best he could
find it there, and reading with passionate
eagerness the books and reviews that came
by the mail. He was affected by all the
currents of thought in those mid-Victorian
years: disturbed by Darwin, excited by
Browning, curious about the wave of spirit-
ualism in the ’seventies. His life was deeply
concerned in these matters. Also, while he
was hostile at first to that free-and-easiness
which was called colonial, he gradually found
himself as an Australian with every part of
him, intellect and all. At any rate, you
feel that his son is harmoniously Australian.
That is the book that remains unknown and
so makes it possible for people to speak of
a book of its type as a mere dream of what
may be written some day!
N.P.
A Satchel of Books
Some Ghost Stories, by A. M. Burrage
(Cecil Palmer). A pack of stories to make
the flesh of any fat boy creep.
The First Lady Wharncliffe and Her
Family (Heinemann). A collection of
family letters extending over 80 years
brought together and put in sequence of date
by the affectionate labor of two grand-
children.
Thirteen Tips on Luck, by Herbert N.
Casson (Cornstalk Co.). According to the
author, luck, unlike the poet, is made, not
born. Every man can make his own luck
if he knows how, and Mr. Casson is out to
teach him.
Ruth, of St. Ronan's, by Angela Brazel
(Blackie). The latest volume from the pen
of this prolific writer of schoolgirl stories
has all the entertaining qualities of its pre-
decessors. Full of interest—there is mystery
in it —and well constructed.
A Naval Venture, by T. T. Jeans
(Blackie). As a surgeon rear-admiral the
writer had exceptional opportunities for
seeing gunroom life during the Dardanelles
operations, and he can depict the tragic side
of war vividly. This is a second edition.
Gorry, by Isabel Cameron (Cornstalk Co.) -
Eight short stories colored with the tender
grey of a Scotch mist. There is simplicity
and tenderness in these brief narratives,
making them a welcome respite from the
hectic sex appeal that shrieks through the
printing press of the day.
The Ship Sails On, by Nordahl Grieg
(Knopf; Robertson and Mullens). A new
school of Scandinavian novelists is push-
ing into the English-reading field per medium
of excellent translations. A cruel, stark
etching, this, of the life of fo’c’s’le ’ands on a
modern tramp.
Chums of the Golden Vanity, 6y P. F.
Westerman (Blackie). The story of two
lads rescued from a wrecked yacht by the
Golden Vanity, sailing under a skipper of the
old school who believed in strict discipline.
A book that will appeal to all boys who have
a tang of the salt in their blood.
The Perilous Quest, by T. A. Niccolls
(Fisher Unwin). An addition to the “First-
novel Library.” There is no dalliance over
literary style in the present yarn, whose
stage is the islands of the South Seas. It
goes with a whoop from start to finish, has
an incomparable villain, a charming maid
and pearls beyond price.
“C. 3,” by Ronald Gurner (Dent). “There’s
only the streets. ’Course, there’s your clubs
and things as well, I know. But some’ow
it’s the streets that gets yer. Then yer
slips” That is the story of John Peverill,
aged 19, whom the streets got, the “crimson
’and” gripped and the prison walls closed
upon. A grim story that probes into the
heart of things.
The Mystery of Diamond Creek, by Alex-
ander Macdonald (Blackie). That the
author has discovered more in Australia than
Australians know is within the license of the
fiction-monger. This is a story of the great
desert, of a mysterious tribe of blacks who
dwell in vast cavernous retreats, of the
search for a lost father and of a wonderful
motor whose record puts all other records in
the shade. It is a book for youth to gloat
over and age to marvel at.
The Shakspeare Mystery, by Georges
Cownes (Cecil Palmer). The author, who
is Professor of English Literature at the
University of Dijon, presents in a series of
lectures a summary view of the question of
the authorship of the plays and poems gen-
erally attributed to William of Stratford.
The claims of Shakspeare, Bacon. Rutland,
Derby and Oxford are discussed. “I see, ’
says the Professor, “uncertainties and gaps
in the Stratfordian theory as against incred-
ible hypotheses in the anti-Stratfordian
theories, which succeed only in replacing a
certain mystery by a mystery 10 times more
incomprehensible.” Finally he comes to the
conclusion that Shakspeare, “supported by
the entire literature of his time, and often
helped by collaborators, professionals like
himself, or even, if you prefer it, noble
amateurs, is the author of most of the works
that bear his name.”
The Chinese Puzzle, by Arthur Ran some
(Allen and Unwin). A luminous account by
the correspondent of the Manchester
Guardian of the Celestial upheaval. He
regards Nationalism as a genuine force which
will dispose of Russian influence when it
has finished making use of it. (It has just
done so, with violence.) Of the position of
Britishers Ransome says :
We must remember that we are tenants, not
proprietors, and that we are not tenants who answered
advertisements seeking such, but tenants.... who
forced their way in. It is not our presence in China
that makes the Chinese puzzle seem disproportionately
connected with ourselves, but the terms on which we
are there. These are such that they can be main-
tained only by a continuous and expensive display of
force. It begins to look as if the friction involved
in an obstinate sticking to leases obtained from the
old man in his dotage, in face of the obvious dis-
satisfaction of his successor, makes it less certain
than it used to be that the retention of such leases
.... is serving its original purpose, which was the
promotion of British trade.
That is the “Manchester” attitude to a
nicety ; but, as Ransome points out, it is also
the attitude of the present Conservative Gov-
ernment in Britain, vide the British pro-
posals of Feb. 3 of last year.
The Impatience of a Parson, by H. R. L.
Sheppard (Hodder and Stoughton; Angus
and Robertson). A plea by the late vicar
of the well-known London church of St.
Martin-in-the-Fields for the recovery of
vital Christianity. In the opinion of the
author the Church of England needs a
great reformer who will recognise the
necessity of asserting that the one funda-
mental demand which Christianity makes on
the individual is “that he should accept the
values of God which Jesus Christ revealed
and endeavor to follow the example of our
Lord in incorruptness of living.” He con-
siders it essential that ail men should think
out their Christianity for themselves, and
not merely accept it on authority; that its
presentation should be enlarged by radical
simplification; that the barriers which
separate the adherents of one church from
another should be removed without delay.
“As I see things,” he concludes, “this
civilisation will go down into the abyss
within a few short years unless the churches
can commend the way of Christ effectively
to the heart and conscience of mankind.”
“C.”: Touching on J. H. M. Abbott’s re-
ference to the printing of the MS. diaries in
the Mitchell Library (B. 22/12/’27), it would
cost several thousand pounds, and the sales
couldn't be relied on to return much of the
outlay. There is one diary, however, which
may be in print soon if the owner, just
off to London, can find the publisher. She is
Mabel Hookey, a Tas. artist and writer; the
diary is one of several kept by the erratic
R, r. Robert Knopwood, the Speck’s first
chaplain. If the matter is not sub-edited too
mercilessly it should make a more enter-
taining book than anything of the discursive
Macquarie’s.

Upon the Little Hills.
Once on the little hills I walked at eve—
The little, low-grassed hills,
YY here sweet winds wander all day long
And heave
The grass in soft, short waves; and
where the song
Of silence born of sound the free air fills.
Westward the spreading skies lay all aglow
And palely glimmering;
Caught in the sunset’s silver spell.
And slow
Out on the little hills the twilight fell,
With music slumb’ring on its folded wing.
Eastward through Heaven’s pearl one star
shone out.
A curlew called. Winds crept
Murmuring, ’mid verdure rippling rank
on rank.

The hillside sudden waiting stillness
sank.
Majestic, calm, an unseen presence stept
Out of the vast, eternal world of space—
A presence great that stirred

(The place

A tiny, tremulous, rustling noise I heard.

A holy peace, sublime

I feel—

The world’s finest type of engine
in the Falcon - Knight Six
The famous Knight double sleeve engine is recognized by
automotive engineers as the finest type of motor car engine.
The new Falcon-Knight six-cylinder engine with seven-
bearing crankshaft, is designed and built to give a su-
perior degree of performance that is always smooth and
quiet. It has a flash of pickup and instant speed not
generally found in other types of motors.
The fame of the Knight-engine is built on its record of
countless thousands of miles of service with unusual free-
dom from carbon trouble and mechanical repair—known
as “The engine that never wears out.”
The Falcon-Knight chassis throughout is designed and
constructed in keeping with the excellence of its engine.
Whether or not you contemplate the immediate purchase
of a motor car we should appreciate an opportunity to
show you the new Falcon-Knight models at our show
rooms and to take you for a demonstration drive.

by the overflowing Thames, and 17 lives were lost in Westminster. Great damage has been done to property and unemployment has been intensified.”

THURSDAY, JANUARY 12, 1928.
OVER-REGULATED AND
OVER-TAXED.
A Queensland Arbitration Judge lately
addressed some fatherly remarks to a trade-
union “executive” which had waged an un-
lawful strike for a 40-hour week and lost it,
losing its registration as well. The matter
before the Court was an application for re-
registration, and his Honor, in granting it
(such applications are always granted),
gently chided the “executive” for its mis-
conduct. Unions, he said in effect, ought
to grapple arbitration to their souls with
hoops of steel. The benefits of the system
were all, or nearly all, on their side—the
employers “got very little out of it.” His
Honor’s frankness is refreshing, but very few
wage-payers will agree with him. Their
view, generally speaking, is that out of arbi-
tration they get trouble in large quantities.
Awards are binding on them but not on the
unions, for fines substantial enough to have
a chastening effect on dissatisfied organisa-
tions are seldom imposed and hardly ever
enforced. The law can be invoked to com-
pel men to join unions and the same men
can be intimidated into striking in defiance
of the law. And under the system which
was to give Australia industrial peace there
were 504 strikes in 1924, 499 in 1925 and
360 in 1926. The 360 strikes in 1926 in-
volved 113,034 work-people, who are esti-
mated to have lo~t £1.415 B°o in wages.
* * $ $
Arbitration is a complicated business,
especially when, as sometimes happens, 40
or 50 unions are represented in one factory.
In such a case the wage-payer is rarely
without a dispute on his hands, for a dis-
pute can be created by merely serving him
with a demand for higher wages. And if
the union is displeased with the Federal
award it can try its luck in the State shop,
kept by “Good Old Piddo” or some such
person, or vice versa, while there is the
periodical settlement by both Federal and
State authorities of the basic wage. All
this comes expensive, and the worry is
worse than the expense. As a matter of
fact—and the fact is important, though
rarely taken into account—Australian manu-
facturers and others who are faced with
fierce overseas competition have burdens
and worries, arbitration among them, from
which their overseas competitors are free.
In N. S. Wales, for instance, the Lang
Government brought in a bill reducing the
working week from 48 hours to 44 and
sought to apply it, quite unconstitutionally,
to industries in which the 48-hour week
operated under. Federal law. One result
was a strike, for the employers stood on
their Federal rights; another was a costly
appeal to the High Court; and in the end
the 44 hours had to be conceded, contracts
based on 48 hours notwithstanding. The
same Government established a tribunal to
deal with workers’ compensation cases, hav-
ing greatly increased the amounts payable
—there was, of course, a thumping increase
in the rates. It introduced to employers a
tax, equal to 6-j p.c. of the wages and salaries
paid by them, by way of providing for child
endowment, and was indignant when it had
to reduce the tax to 3 p.c. It also shoved
up the income-tax on companies and the
hated middle class. (Incidentally, there
are two income-taxes, with differing rates
and methods of assessment, in each of the
six States, and two land-taxes and two lots
of death-duties as well. And in three
States there are two Electoral Departments
to enrol the same elector and summons
him if he neglects to apprise both of every
change of address.) Insurance against un-
employment was another of Lang’s schemes,
and at the same time one of Bruce’s
Royal Commissions was collecting informa-
tion for a Federal scheme of insurance
against unemploAonent, invalidity and old
age. And all this during a period when
manufacturers had to keep on reminding
the Bruce-Pages that the tariff, such as it
was, had failed to prevent a flood of im-
ports seriously in excess of exports.
* * * sfc
Australia needs new industries and needs
them sorely, as the lengthening lists of un-
employed attest. But the conditions here-
described in part do not make for the estab-
lishment of new industries or the prosperity
of those already in existence. Industry is
over-regulated and over-taxed. It- will have
to be freed from the maddening business of
preparing unnecessary returns. A complete
separation will have to be effected between
Federal and State spheres of industrial law
and taxation. And though it will be difficult
to make an end of the litigious method of
arbitration, Australians will have to frankly
consider, the unions above all, whether it
is worth what it costs. Unionism loses,
along with the rest of us, when a good
employer with a talent for industry sinks
under his accumulation of worries into an
untimely grave, or sells out, perhaps to some
overseas competitor who will close the fac-
tory as soon as it can be done with dis-
cretion, or merely retires from business.
Without intending it, the politicians who
have heaped all these burdens on industry,
and are forever suggesting others, have pro-
vided a means of escape for the good wage-
payer who is fed up with their proceedings,
and the profiteer who has made a good
thing out of the passing-on process within
its limits—they have floated many loans
the interest on which is exempt from tax.
THE LIES THAT ARE TOLD.
The captain of the Tahiti, under examina-
tion in Sydney, told the Royal Commis-
sioner that nearly all the statement he had
made to the police in Maoriland was wrong;
the police had, he said, simply terrified him
into saying foolish things. Almost simul-
taneously in Christchurch (M.L.) one
Boakes, a married taxi-driver, was charged
with the murder of a young girl with whom
he was said to be on intimate terms. The
main witness for the prosecution was a
chemist’s assistant who swore at the pre-
liminary hearing that he had supplied the
accused with drugs intended for the usual
purpose, At the trial, this witness went back
completely upon his prior testimony, giving
as his reason that the detective in charge
of the case had bullied him into making
the statement. This retraction made an
acquittal certain.
Scarcely is there a defended trial but
some confession is bitterly criticised by
either the prosecuting or defending counsel
—the one suggesting that if men are honor-
able they relate the same story to the police
as to the jury, the other explaining that it
is possible for an innocent man, under cer-
tain circumstances, to say the first thing
that comes into his head.
“That all men are guilty until they are
proved to be innocent,” says Taylor, in
his Treatise on Evidence, “is naturally the
creed'of the police, whose professional zeal,
fed as it is by an habitual intercourse with
the vicious, and by the frequent contempla-
tion of human nature in its most revolting
form, almost necessarily leads them to
ascribe actions to the worst motives.” Police
officials are not concerned with any abstract
theories of justice; they desire, like most
of us, to finish their tasks and, with that
end in view, have a tendency to frame their
testimony in a way that will close most
avenues of escape. “It frequently happens,”
said Baron Parke, “not only that the witness
has misunderstood what was said, but by
unintentionally altering a few of the ex-
pressions really used, he gives an effect to
the statement completed at variance with
what was really said.”
The argument so constantly advanced
by “the Crown,” that an innocent man must
of necessity make a truthful statement, is
at best a superficial one. No man can ex-
plain all the circumstances that may weigh
against him; and trivial, simple coincidences
may under the lash of criticism appear signi-
ficant and incredible. What are the thoughts
and feelings of a man, happy and contented
with the esteem of the community and
the love of his adult family, wrongly con-
fronted with charges of a sexual nature?
The alleged offences as such are of small
concern in comparison with the realisation
that his peace and happiness are shattered
and social ostracism stares him in the face.
To the innocent, publicity is a greater
punishment than it is to the guilty, who
have at any rate the solace that it was
caused by their own misdeeds. The mere
fact of acquittal does not wash out the
stigma of having been charged, for the
platitude that there is never smoke without
fire has long been popular with a public
that reveres a half-truth far more than it
does the whole one. Mr. Justice Coleridge
has stated that the maxim “no one is bound
to accuse himself” is as important and as
wise as almost any other in our law; but,
should the accused refuse to make a state-
ment, no one but a confirmed optimist can
expect the prosecution to take a favorable
view of the fact.
The instincts of terror and self-preserva-
tion must be present in eveiy man charged
with a crime, their strength varying with
the nature of the individual, of the offence
and of his complicity in it; and, in the
suspect, torn mentally by conflicting in-
terests, the desire for self-preservation (to
use that term in its widest sense) is in-
variably the stronger factor of the two. In
consequence, an accused person may readily
adopt the expedient of a false statement
when its immediate advantages outweigh
its future disadvantages. For instance, a
married man may have to rely upon his
mistress to establish an alibi—a course that
invites scandal as well as other and costlier
inconveniences. At the time of his arrest,
he says what is untrue, not to conceal guilt,
but to stifle inquiry.
There is no accounting for some human
actions. Vanity, misunderstanding, ignor-
ance, confusion or the lesser of two evils—
all may lead to a confession upon which no
reliance can be placed. And, as Mr. Justice
Maule has so cynically observed, whenever
there is no evidence against a prisoner, he
is at once seized with a desire to confess
something.
W. E. LEICKSTER.
PLAIN ENGLISH.
The Tahiti’s Fault.
The Bulletin’s maritime contributor has
made the law and the practice on the sub-
ject of collisions at sea very clear. A
master is not to put his ship into such a
position that a collision will be caused by
failure on the other’s part to do something.
As this paper said on November 17: —
“The whole essence of that branch of sea-
manship which deals with navigation, pilot-
age, the handling of ships and the rule of
the road is to make certain beforehand, and,
if one cannot make certain, to allow suf-
ficient margin for even the most unlikely con-
tingencies.
“The most flawless set of rules in existence
are the International Regulations for Pre-
venting Collisions at Sea, and there is
nothing more certain that that, if the facts
can be established, blame for a maritime dis-
aster can be apportioned with absolute accu-
racy. But even these Regulations admit
that they may on occasions cease to function
through either negligence or ignorance or for
some other reason, for they draw a sharp
distinction between two periods prior to a
collision or the avoidance thereof. The first
period is that in which two vessels may
possibly collide; everything proceeds nor-
mally till the one whose duty it is to do so
makes the alteration of course or speed which
obviates the collision. The second period
commences when the ship which should ‘give
way’ neglects to do so and collision becomes
‘imminent.’ In such a case the Regulations
state that nothing elsewhere contained in
the Rules shall exempt the master of any
ship from taking every possible step to avoid
a collision. In other words, the vessel which
has the right of way may not go blithely
on and allow herself to collide if there is
anything she could have done to save the
situation.”
Justice Campbell’s conclusion is that on
top of the excessive speed of the Tahiti
there was a momentary diversion of atten-
tion from what was in the vessel’s path—
a diversion caused by a passing boat —and
that the Greycliffe’s peril, which should
have been foreseen, came to those on the
Tahiti’s bridge as a surprise and a shock.
But while the Tahiti is thus held wholly
blameworthy, the admitted fact that the
master of the Greycliffe could not conveni-
ently see what was behind him, owing to
the structure of his ferry, is held to require
attention. And though he could not see what
was following and overtaking him, no other
look-out was kept. This supports the claim
made by The Bulletin hitherto: that the
masters of these ferries should not be
boxed in as they are. Of course it would
be still safer if they could be also pro-
vided with look-outs. But that is all a
question of expense. If the public will
pay, well and good. But the wages of un-
skilled labor have been so pushed up that
thousands of things that ought to be done
are not done, and cannot be done.
With one other point raised by The
Bulletin the Commission did not concern
itself. Most of the loss of life was pro-
bably due to passengers being unable to
escape from the saloons. All these ought
to be provided with exit doors opening
directly seawards.
O
The Sydney Trams.
Vague language is in the air about the pos-
sible sale of the Sydney tramways, or of
all the tramways in the county of Cumber-
land, outright or in a half-and-half way,
to a concern in which Vue Government will
retain an interest but which the other people
will manage. The ’bus interest is mentioned,
or mentions itself, as a possible buyer. The
N.S.W. Government owns, or its creditors
do, 228jj miles of tram, of which 18| miles
are closed, one mile is said to show a
profit, and the rest is nominally on the
losing list. The accounts, however, lump
118 miles of city and suburban lines
together, and reveal a deficit over the lot
without separating the sheep from the
goats.
Trams represent £11,538,595 of loan money
and £47,455 that by some accident was paid
out of revenue. Should an attempt be made
to sell them the question remains to find
a buyer who can pay in the kind of money
(not paper) winch can be used to reduce the
capital borrowed in London for tramway
construction. While Australia makes so
little and imports so much, and has the
adverse trade balance sitting, spook-like, on
its doorstep, the problem of finding real
money to meet real liabilities will never
quit.
But in wwy case a sale looks too much
like acceptance of the gospel of despair.
Is democratic government a failure? Isn’t
it possible to make it a success? If we
have failed—and we have failed only in
patches—isn’t it our own fault?
Must we burn down the house to roast
the pig?
The Three Sultans of Sydney.
Sydney still has a Town Hall, but it has
lost its Mayor and aldermen and the bur-
gesses have lost their right to elect the
Municipal Council. As a matter of abstract
justice this is as it should be. City govern-
ment for some years has been administered
from the Trades Hall, and the odor that
arose from various civic transactions was
vile. The thing had got too bad to be
mended and it had to be ended. So the
Bavinshaws have taken a leaf out of Lord
Fisher’s book and sacked the lot, placing
administrative powers in the hands of three
of their own nominees.
The men selected are of good reputation
and, though apparently weak on the prac-
tical business side, appear to be otherwise
well qualified for their job, and they prob-
ably will manage city affairs much more
economically and effectively than has been
the case for some years. Everybody realises
this, and that, perhaps, is why there has
been no really forceful opposition to the
change. But, despite the precedents pro-
vided in Dublin and the London borough
of West Ham, the change is out of tune
with Anglo-Saxon political principles. In
the United States, where city government
by commission had its origin, the commis-
sioners are, as a rule, elected by the citizens.
In Sydney, as in Dublin and West Ham,
there is now taxation without representa-
tion, government without the consent of
the governed, and a confiscation by a central
government of a right of local government
quite legally held and sanctioned by tradi-
tion and long usage.
That the right was improperly used and
had to be curtailed in the public interest
is true; that the results, in this particular
instance, are likely to be beneficial is also
true. But supposing the Slang-Whangs
had appointed the commissioners, on the
principles applied by them in so many of
their appointments! And if government
by an appointed Commission is applicable
to a badly-managed city, why not to a
badly-managed State, or even to a badly-
managed Commonwealth?
Navies of the Air.
Amid all the talk of treaties of perpetual
peace, of “renouncing” and “outlawing” war,
the nations are rearming themselves. And
every first-class Power except Britain is
giving its Air Force a substantial share of
annual appropriations. Exact figures con-
cerning military and naval air establishments
are not easy to get at, but the Morrow


Aircraft Board, set up in the United States
to collect information, says that at the
beginning of 1926 Britain possessed 1003
military ’planes and France had in com-
mission 5542. Mussolini, of Italy, has
recently announced a programme of con-
struction that will raise the number of its
military ’planes from the present strength
of 1123 to 2797 at the end of 1930. The
United States has a five years’ programme
which will give a strength of 2800 ’planes
in 1932.
Britain’s annual allocations are smaller
than those of any of the other nations
mentioned; and as at least half her military
’planes are stationed abroad, her inferiority
in air strength becomes more marked. In
1922, when the economy axe was being
wielded relentlessly, hundreds of British
fighting ’planes were scrapped and the
establishment was reduced to five squadrons.
In 1923 the Baldwin Government an-
nounced that it was going to create an Air
Force of 52 squadrons “with as little delay
as possible,” but the programme - has not
been carried out.
Commercial aviation also has languished
in Britain, which at present has only 20
machines in commercial service. Germany
has hundreds and France is covered by a
network of air-lines. French subsidies to
civil aviation last year amounted to
£1,300,000; this year £1,500,000 will be avail-
able. Britain’s allocation for the current
financial year is £464,000, half of which
goes in subsidies. German commercial air
routes cover 14,862 miles; French routes,
8304 miles; British routes, 2226 miles, in-
cluding Cairo-Basra. The United States
has already an elaborate air postal service
and many passenger routes, and the nation’s
ambition is to build up a complete airway
and airpost system. Britain sticks to the
theory that the navy is the first line of
defence and the dominions are dominated
by that policy. A strong first line is no
doubt essential; but a house with invin-
cible foundations is a poor thing to live in
if the roof leaks or the chimneys smoke.

Hard To Let Go.
America is becoming more and more com-
mitted to an Imperial policy, if such a
thing can be said about a republic. It
began with the acquisition of the Philip-
pines and other Spanish holdings which were
to be given up as soon as their manners
and morals had improved. Cuba was thus
handed over to its native citizens after
American business interests had fixed an
unbreakable grip thereon. The same thing
was proposed for the Philippines, but here
the American Government found itself in
the predicament _ of its famous citizen who,
having grabbed a grizzly by the tail, found
it inadvisable to let go. A similar situation
seems to have arisen in Nicaragua, where
America butted in many months ago, on
the plea of safeguarding the national
interests there. There is a lot of national
principal there also, and the necessity for
securing this has led to a continued
strengthening of American troops, which
have suffered a few casualties while inter-
vening between the two hostile native
parties. The original American landing in
Nicaragua was to be a matter of a few
days. It has now lasted for over 18 months,
and looks like going on for 18 years.
The whole incident calls attention to the
fact that America must eventually mop up
t.he saddle-colored republics between the
Rio Grande and the mainland of South
America. American business men are already
exploiting their immensely rich resources,
utterly neglected by the indifferent Greaser;
but they find the piebald Governments un-
satisfactory to deal with, and hard to run
on a schedule. If they could be system-
atised, under the capable eye of American
business, the profits would be as immense
as the security would be unassailable. But
nothing short of taking over is likely to
answer; and though this will cost money, the
prospective profit will justify it.
The Whole Gospel of Bodkin.
The secretary of the railways branch of the
A.W.U., Bodkin by name, has issued a
statement that his union never had, in its
previous history, quite so large a propor-
tion of unemployed. It is probably true,
or nearly so. Then he wandered away to
the hackneyed subject of public works
(loan works), and said, by way of perora-
tion, that “the unemployment problem is
one that only Government can solve.”
The intensity of this old delusion is path-
etic. Yet the facts are few and simple.
Loan works cost too much by the time they
are finished, and they cost a great deal too
much after they are finished. When a job
is built for half a million, and then demon-
strates its capacity to lose another half-
million every five or ten years, it is plain
that the national capacity for staggering
under “works” must have a limit some-
where. The money-lender is beginning to
point that out. So the time is coming, and
has almost come, when the people whom the
Bodkins represent must be content to work
more extensively for private employers. And
in order that private employers may have
work available, it may be necessary to be
more industrious—in some lines of effort
anyhow—and a great deal more reasonable,
and much less subservient to mostly im-
ported trouble-makers.
There are abundant possibilities of
employment in this country, only there is
also an amazingly thick-headed tendency to
regard employment, save the doing of un-
profitable things with Government loans, as
something to be put down with a strong
hand. In one recent year Canada exported
£50,000,000 worth more of its own merchan-
dise than it imported. Australia’s latest
record is that its purchases exceeded its
sales of merchandise abroad by £31,000,000.
The obvious inference is that Canada had
£81,000,000 worth more work than Australia
had.
The way to get Australia out of the
morass is to eradicate the whole doctrine
of Bodkin that “the unemployment problem
is one that only Government can solve.”
Government never solved it, for as soon as
one loan work was finished and had begun
to lose money the unemployed were adrift
again, and as badly in need of solution
as ever.

The Right to Live.
“Conscripted Spinster”: “The Right to
Live” (B. 29/12/’27) gives the impression
that “Eromeno” is a misogynist as well as
an inefficient unskilled worker. With
illogical ravings against “Flossie Tickle-
me,” as he calls the whole body of women
workers, he insinuates that the average busi-
ness place is really a pleasure house. Many
of the girls he is ranting about are the
daughters of dead Diggers; the more mature
of them are sisters and sweethearts of his
fallen comrades. Illogical man was ever
thus. When the surplus female—as he terms
the woman who has not caught a man to
keep her out of the struggle for a crust —
stayed at home and looked after aged
parents, or was general servant and nurse
to the children of married sisters, and
brothers, she was a “parasite.” Now that
she fends for herself she is still a “parasite.”
“Eremeno” may be interested to learn
that many of the “bare-legged hussies” carry
man-sized burdens. I know three young
girls who, on their united wages, keep a
widowed mother and a jmunger sister and
brother, and make their own clothes as
well.
I’ve never found any business house a
benevolent institution, nor come in contact
with ogling bosses, and I’ve been in the
business world since early war days. Stern
necessity drove me from the shelter of
home—sounds like a sob novelette—and the
fortunes of war kept me there. No, my
beloved is not pushing up the poppies in
a foreign land; he found the attractions of
a French Flossie much more alluring.

Uncle Sam and Labor.
One of the secrets of Uncle Sam’s efficiency
as a manufacturer is that his factories are
amply supplied with mechanical power—
U- h.p. to every factory-worker, man,
woman or child. It goes without saying that
the power is relatively cheap, and every
country that has tried the experiment has
found that cheap power not only means
the expansion of existing industries, but
the creation of new ones. The Speck and
Maoriland are instances near at hand.
Another reason for Sam’s industrial suc-
cess is that he has discovered that it pays
to be efficient, and to spend a lot of money
finding out the best and cheapest ways of
doing things. There are two Federal boards
that act as supervisors and co-ordinators of
manufacturing and agricultural research, but
the manufacturing research work is almost
entirely done in the laboratories of large
industrial corporations. One of these has
1180 men employed on experimental work
and regards the money thus spent as an
excellent investment.
The business of management, too, has
been brought to a very high pitch of effi-
ciency in America. From chief executive
down to the foreman of the smallest shop
the aim is always to do better this year
than last; this month than last; this week
than last. A great deal of attention is paid
to the training of workers. This has been
forced on manufacturers by the difficulty of
obtaining apprentices for skilled trades
owing to the fact that unskilled workers can
earn as much at 17 as at 70, and the wages
to start with are higher than those given
to apprentices. The apprenticeship system
is bj r no means universal, but in cases where
it does apply—the great rail companies, for
example—the apprentice starts at 25 cents
an hour, which is 20 cents less than he
could earn as a laborer; but in four years
he can rise to as high as 75 cents an hour.
Not only that, but if he has given satis-
faction there is a bonus of 100 or 150 dollars
waiting for him at the end of his term.
In practically all manufacturing industries
there is a wide differentiation between the
wages paid to skilled and unskilled labor.
In the motor-car trade a laborer gets 30
cents an hour and a skilled craftsman—not
a foreman, even—up to five times as much.
As to the purchasing power of wages,
Sam doesn’t base wages on the “cost of
living” to any great extent, but on the
earnings of industry. His unskilled work-
ers undoubtedly have a harder spin than
the laborers of Australia do, but trained
and industrious workers almost certainly
enjoy a considerably higher standard of
living than does the best type of Austra-
lian journeyman. Though the basic neces-
sities of living in America are relatively
dear, luxuries such as automobiles, radio
sets, piano-players, gramophones and so
forth are relatively cheap, and the worker
who has climbed above the bread line has
a good time.
Australia has no need to slavishly copy
any other country, but this country cannot
afford to disregard the fundamental com-
monsense principles on which America’s
industrial success has been founded. They
are few and simple:—
(1) You can’t contiuue long to pay wages
that aren’t earned.
(2) You must offer the workers a reason-
able incentive to do their best.
(3) You mustn’t use man-power for any
job that mechanical power can undertake.

Obsession.
“J.E.”: A grand campaign of homerbuilding
and house-provision is breaking out in
Australia. It is to be financed with money
provided by the State and Federal Sav-
ings Banks and the Rural Bank, and by
Federal loans, and by all sorts of dodges.
The advances are to be up to 90 per cent,
of the price of the premises, and even 100
per cent, has been suggested. The price is
practically certain to be a boom one. Most
prices are boom prices in these times, and
many of them are boomer.
The proposition is frequently advanced
that it is, or should be, the ambition of
every citizen to possess his own roof. Why
it should be a special virtue to possess his
house roof any more than his office or
factory ceiling is not clear. If the great
mortgage project comes off any new Aus-
tralian city or suburb will be a congeries
of low-browed shacks, a high-browed shack
being beyond the needs of an average
family, and an extravagance. There is, in
short, an intense desire in stuffy-minded
quarters to reduce freedom, motion and the
pioneering instinct to a minimum. It is
to be very difficult for anyone to move, at
the bidding of ambition, to a fresh town,
without first selling his house, and it will
be difficult to arrive satisfactorily at the
new location without buying or building a
house. These transactions involve time,
worry, legal expenses, estate-agent’s com-
mission, and possibly other forms of
brokerage and sharkage, including at times
the complete default of the agent.
No novelty attaches to the hysterical dis-
covery that perpetual happiness and pros-
perity may be conferred on people by put-
ting them into small boom-price homes,
which are all their own save for a lifetime
of instalments stretching ahead. A very few
years ago it was found out by the same
shrieking brotherhood that the same effect
was attainable by putting them on to small
boom-price farms with the same vista of
time-payment in view. The losses are still
being patiently added up.
There are even greater possibilities in
front of the public institutions which are to
lend other people’s money to home-builders
on a 10 per cent, margin, advancing £9OO
on a nominal £IOOO worth of bricks and
mortar, or possibly some more fleeting
material. Each £ which the debtor pays to
the creditor in the early stages will very
largely represent present interest, so that
even in the first four or five years the £9OO
liability won’t have diminished much. And
by that time a reaction from boom land
prices and building costs may have set in.
When he makes his exit the 10 per cent,
nominal margin may in that case have be-
come a very real deficiency.

Why Not Bank Wages?
“K.0.0.K.”: I work amongst men who earn
big wages —double and treble the basic wage.
Most of us pass the savings bank to go to
a pub, and do not put a penny away. Were
the employers required to pay a man’s wages
into the Savings Bank, a lot of us would
let it stay there. I suppose Parliamentary
authority would be needed, though Arbi-
tration tribunals might surely order it.
I was once upon a time paid by this
method. I liked it and would like it again;
and I know many another man who would.
For one thing, we know that if we did get
a knock-out drop on the way home on pay
day we wouldn’t be gone through for the
whole of our week’s pay.

Unions and the Ballot Box.
Twenty or thirty militants in a branch
union or miners’ lodge of four or
five hundred members gain control.
Contributing to this is the howling
down by the noisy few of any mem-
ber seeking to impart a little intelli-
gent thought to any discussion. Possessing
moderate views has been synonymous with
being “a boss’s man”; and in many known
cases the militants have seen to it that not
only has a moderately-minded member been
persecuted, but the vendetta has been ex-
tended to the family circle.
According to the recently-issued annual
report of the Northern (Newcastle) Executive
of the Miners’ Federation, this minority
control of meetings has lately back-kicked
in that central council. For every 25 mem-
bers a lodge is entitled to one vote; so
that a lodge with, say, 800 members has
a voting strength of 32. Yet decisions
reached at the meeting of that lodge may
be determined by no more than 25 mem-
bers, while in the case of a lodge of much
smaller membership, say, 60, there may be
50 present. Thus an attendance of 50
members in the one case has a voting-
strength of only two at the central council,
wdrereas in the other instance an attendance
of 25 carries a voting strength of 32. So
long as the inner circle could control the
small minority all was well. But lately
control has passed more or less to outside
propagandists; hence the squeak!
It is now proposed to inflict a penalty
for non-attendance at lodge meetings, with
the object of ensuring representative attend-
ances and consequent true reflection of the
views of the membership. This may be
the beginning of the end of “militancy” in
miners’ lodges; but to ensure its demise
the large majority who have hitherto been
brow-beaten would have to adopt similar
tactics and hound the noisy ones to their
proper place in the lodges. And of course
they won’t. The ballot is the only means
by which the true opinion of the whole
membership can be got; and that must be
under independent control or the big stick
will be waved over the ballot-box, too.

Should the G.F. Do His Own Surgery?
“Dr. Nil”: There are many statements in
the letter of the Macquarie-street man
“Carysfort” (B. 29/12/’27) which are of
doubtful accuracy though far from doubtful
exaggeration. Only one of them need be
taken as of any importance to the general
public, to whom he appeals in the last para-
graph of his letter, commencing with that
somewhat reminiscent phrase “Do not be
deceived.” Speaking of the “recent gradu-
ate” he says: “It is impossible for the recent
graduate to have acquired the experience
necessary for even minor operations”; and,
further on, “but he can become not only a
legally qualified surgeon, but even a Fellow
of the Royal College of Surgeons, without
ever having opened a whitlow or inserted
a stitch.” The ordinary qualification for
practising medicine in Australia includes that
of Master in Surgery, or its equivalent;
and to say that a graduate who holds this
certificate is incompetent to perform opera-
tions is practically to accuse the schools that
issue it of selling a qualification that does
not qualify, and thus defrauding the public.
$
Uncle Sam’s Navy.
“X.N.0.”: I agree with every word “Cen-
turion” (B. 29/12/’27) says about the diffi-
culty the U.S.A. will have in manning the
vast fleet she proposes to amass if and
when it materialises —provided Yankee
sentiment towards its naval service continues
as at present. But will it?
In England the navy and to only a
slightly less degree the army are given almost
always first consideration when the question
arises “What shall we do with our boys?”
The whole matter is closely allied to tradi-
tion. Yankee naval traditions are practi-
cally nil; on the other hand, the
millionaire-complex is very prevalent,
and the services receive scant consideration
owing to their inevitable financial limita-
tions. Remember, too, that as recently as
1849, a short 79 years ago, people were
pioneering the west and middle west in
covered wagons. Necessarily and rightly the
American nation has been looking inward
from the sea, and the business of internal
development has turned American thoughts
away from the desire for external or colonial
development. Naturally, therefore, pride of
place is given to shore occupations, land and
mineral development and manufacturing
within America; colonial expansion with
its concomitant navy has been out of
American thoughts, with a consequent be-
littlement, sub-conscious perhaps, of the
naval service.
What, however, is going to happen in the
future? Is there any likelihood that, with
a huge expansion of the American navy and
with the conception of overseas empire
that must result therefrom, the status of the
American naval service may not be very
considerably raised in popular estimation?
If that should happen the manning difficul-
ties referred to by “Centurion” are likely
to disappear and with them will go much
of the inefficiency and bad discipline that
have earned for the U.S.N. the soubriquet
of “The Noisy Navy.”
Americans can do big things efficiently
given the right material, and it is quite
possible, even probable, that the future
American navy will get the right material,
though it has not done so in the past.
On December 7 New York shipped £200,000
in gold to London to stabilise exchange be-
tween England and U.S.A. This is the first
gold movement to England since the start
of the Great War in 1914, and it seems to
be the turning point in a long fight. During
the years of the war John Bull dug deep into
the nation’s purse to provide supplies for
his fighting men. When the fortunes of the
Allies looked black, he had to dig deeper
still. Then the Hell’s Orchestra ceased, and
with the silence came the reckoning. The
victors counted their dead—and their pawn-
tickets. John, instead of cursing the pawn-
broker, rolled up his sleeves and set to
work to pay his debts; and so complete
have been his arrangements that London
swings back to the days of its old-time
greatness.
How far Russia is returning to the methods
of the “Capitalistic” States may be judged
from the “Economic Survey No. 9” recently
issued by the State Bank of the Soviet Re-
public. It resembles in most respects simi-
lar papers issued by other Governments
which disclaim all connection with Com-
munism. Most of the loans raised from
1922-25 were for short terms, chiefly
lottery loans, and were made a success by
obligatory subscription. As a result the
bonds were soon for sale at any price they
would fetch. By 1926, however, the reform
of the currency was completed, and the in-
vestor class increased in numbers; and the
fact that all industrial and commercial cor-
porations are compelled by law to keep
their reserve funds in State bonds accounts
for some of the success the Government has
met with. But the cost of the loans to the
State is still tremendous—no less than 13
per cent.

POLITICAL
POINTS
The amount of loan and other money lost
in putting returned soldiers on the land is a
little bigger each time the subject comes up.
The sum which the Commonwealth lent to
the States for soldier-settlement is printed
as £34,694,311 (30/6/’27), and it is noAV
stated that £19,500,000 has been lost. The
CommonAvealth has borrowed Justice Pike
from N.S.W. to inquire into the matter, as
if enough hadn’t been borrowed without
adding Mr. Pike.
The £50,000 presented to the Vic. Govern-
ment by the Bruce-Pages in lieu of 27 years’
rent of the Parliamentary buildings in Spring-
street, Melbourne, has been a grievous prob-
lem to the State legislators. One proposal
Avas to spend the money on a dome, and
another was to use it to enlarge the kitchen.
Many members were keen on the enlarged
kitchen, but the Hogan Ministry has decided
instead to extend the structure on the north-
west. The extension is to be called the Com-
monwealth Wing, as a graceful allusion to
the flight to Canberra.
The last murky row of the Sydney muni-
cipal Labor regime centred in a story that
the Lord Mayor was urged in his official
dying moments to sign a contract for the
purchase of 850,000 tons of coal. Coal pro-
blems or coalmine-purchase problems haunted
the late unlamented civic institution all its
days, and in between there were motor-car
and public-house and resumption and street-
paving-material problems, the last being
mixed up with rude remarks about “a bob
a yard commission.” The pace was too wild
to last.
Bruce’s Development and Migration Com-
mission began its operations with four mem-
bers. E. P. Fleming has resigned to accept
the chairmanship of the Sydney Civic Com-
mission, and C. S. Nathan, the Westralian
representative, has retired to enjoy a knight-
hood. If the rot spreads to the other score
or so. of Commissions the Administration may
find itself obliged to carry on the government
itself.
With a faith Avhich ought to shift moun-
tains a deputation waited on S. Australian
Premier Butler to propose a basic wage for
the unemployed, and met the reply that it
was a blank impossibility. Butler had a
deficit of £1,050,049 at June, 1927, and in
the half-year since then the public income
has decreased, by another £131,422. This
Avas one of the matters which helped to
make him the wildest Premier in Christen-
dom Avhen an Arbitration Court, which was
quite as unreasonable as the unemployed
and had much less reason to be unreason-
able, sent him instructions to put up rail-
way wages a trifle.
Bruce is planning to import four leading
representatives of “finance, industry and
transport” to “advise on matters vital to
Australia’s development.” It would be hope-
ful if the representatives would teach this
country how to finance with its own money,
and practise more successful industry,
and transport the proceeds to the external
creditor when he is wanting to be paid. But
the Avord “development” makes this paper
suspicious. “Development” in the mouth of
a Government has come to mostly mean hot
air in large quantities.
Superintendent Mankoy, head of the detec-
tive branch in N. S. Wales, has just reached
the age limit and retired on pension. He
is 59. Lucky the land that .can afford to
keep its public servants in idleness after they
are 59. The trouble is that it may not be
REFLECTED GLORY.
“Tardy recognition of Australian art is seen in the knighthood of portrait painter John Longstall
at the age of 66.”
POLITICAL KNIGHT: “Congratulations, Sir John—though ’ow they ever come to pick
on you I can't imagine, unless it’s because you’ve depicted so many of hus.”
half so lucky as hard borrowing makes it
think it is. In any case, to begin to keep
able-bodied men in idleness at 59 is a piece
of stupid wastefulness.
Sunday, Jan. 8, Avas the jubilee of Vic-
toria’s Black Wednesday, when the Berry
Government sacked public servants high arid
low. The sacking was a reprisal for the
Leg. Council’s opposition to payment of
Assembly members, and many of the victims
Avere not re-employed, though one—the late
Byron Moore, sec. to the V.R.C. —got even
by drawing a pension for 45 years. We.
civil servants still shiver when Black Wed-
nesday is mentioned. And the retrenchment
in the Raihvay Department and the suggested
reorganisation of the Lands are recalling it.
During a strenuous week or two there Avas
an abundance of employment in British cities
for the able-bodied toiler who cared to shovel
snow, but of the multitude on the dole only
a fraction offered. It was bad policy, for it
raised a doubt as to the sincerity of their
desire to toil. In nine years Britain has
handed out over £379,000,000 to its unem-
ployed, and allowed its markets to be
swamped with foreign goods, wherefore they
were kept unemployed. Considering the very
different situation of Germany, Canada and
the United States, the pauper allowance
appears a rotten substitute for a high Pro-
tective tariff.
Somebody hoaxed the Age with a yarn
that ex-Premier Harry Lawson contemplated
retiring from the Vic. Assembly with the
view of standing for the Bendigo seat in
the Uppah Chambah. A jocular remark to a
humorless denizen of the Plush House seems
to have given rise to the story, at which Larv-
son scoffed. All the same, it would be no-
thing new for an ex-Premier representing
iCastlemaine to go over to the Uppercut
House. James Service made the change 49
years ago, and stayed with the Landlords
for 11 years.
When the N.S.W, Parliament meets again
the Bavin Government intends to try its
hand at a mild form of decentralisation along
the lines sketched by the New States Com-
mission. That body recommended, not that
N.S.W. should be subdivided into smaller
States (such a thing was quite beyond it),
but that local governing bodies should have
more power; and if the State boundaries
are not to be altered, more power they should
have. But Avhile the making of raihvays to
new ports, and the opening and manage-
ment of ucav ports, and the distribution of
the loan money are all centred in the capital
of an unwieldy State, that capital will con-
tinue to bloat at the expense of the country
districts.
Demobbed Labor aldermen ol Sydney
must have sighed enviously Avhen it was
announced that the total of Greater Bris-
bane’s municipal employees would presently
exceed 5000, the G. B. Council being aboui
to take over the Water and Sewerage Board.
What opportunities for city fathers xvith
friends interested in tenders and constituents
who Avant light and lucrative billets !
Yankee protests against our slightly-
improved tariff are pouring in on the Aus-
tralian representative in NeAV York. It is
particularly objected that lower-grade pianos
may be entirely shut out, which seems hope-
> a tariff is intended to shut out some-
tlnng. Simultaneously come assurances that
Wow York is willing to take up more Aus-
tralian loans so that we will have the money
to pay for the pianos and things. But Aus-
tralia begins to get a glimmer of sense, and
to realise that it is better to have the job
ot making the piano than to be out of Avork,
and, after struggling with more interest
accounts, to leaAm another debt and a worn-
out. music-box to a dunned and jobless pos-
terity.
A ireless receiving licenses, which have
hitherto cost 275. 6d. p.a., or 30s. if paid in
two instalments, are in future to be 245.
P- a -> Postmaster-General Gibson announces.
_Uie department having experienced great
difficulties in connection with the instalment
system,” that system is to be abolished;
nevertheless, “holders of the present license
", rai have paid the first instalment will
still have the obligation to pay the second.”
In other words, the department will put up
with the “difficulties” a while longer for the
sake of the extra money to be extorted from
youngsters and others to whom every shilling
is a consideration. If payment by instal-
ments is such a bore to Gibson’s crowd, it
could be arranged to let people pay the
245. when the first instalment runs out. But
a simple thing like that Avouldn’t occur to
the dull bureaucratic mind.
The S. M. Herald is at the head of a
movement to sell the Sydney and suburban
trams to a private co. The idea, of course,
is that services in the hands of the Govern-
ment are badly run. But Avliose fault is
that? Whose fault, Avas it, for instance, that
the N.S.W. Leg. Council was so futile in the
days of Lang? Chiefly, of course, George
I 1 uller’s —when he had the opportunity he
neglected to do things. And the Bruce-
Bages are neglecting to do things now so far
as law-breaking unions are concerned. If
Governments had done what they should have
done a Civic Commission wouldn’t have been
necessary now in Sydney. And let there be
no mistake about it. That it is necessary
is something for a democratic community,
and especially past democratic Governments,
to be thoroughly ashamed of.
The Commonwealth Shipping Line has
been offered for sale in one lot with two big
anchors attached to it. It is to be bought
by Britisli-born people or by a company
in which they predominate, and the buyers
are to maintain an Anglo-Australian service
equal to the present one, with the present
or equally good ships, for 10 years. When
the offer was published the Commonwealth
was making a poor slioav at maintaining its
own serA'ice, the Moreton Bay being in the
usual trouble, while the job-controllers were
laying up the inter-State fleet. Still some
multi-millionaire Avho appreciates the idea
of being tied to a stake for 10 years to be
the sport of Walsh, Jolianson and Co. may
come forward—at a price. Australia won’t
necessarily get the use of any more ships
than if the fleet was sold unconditionally to
the highest bidder, and it will certainly lose
money—perhaps enough millions to complete
the South-to-Nortli railway.
Reshuffle of the portfolios of the Hogan
(Vic.) Labor Ministry is being urged upon
the Premier, who has the right to allot the
offices as he pleases. Slater is overworked
as Luav and Agricultural Minister, and
better use could be made of Tunnecliffe than
to place him in nominal control of two com-
missions—raihvay and electricity-—that are
virtually independent of him. ‘ If Hogan
left the Treasury and took Water Supply
only he would hai'e time for more general
supervision. Then Prendergast is entitled to
an easier job than the Chief Secretary’s,
w hich includes police, prisons, neglected
children, abo. protection, lunacy, licensing
and no end of things. Beckett, M.L.C., would
revel in such activities, and Upper House
Ministers are Chief Secretaries in South
Aus. and the West.
South Aus. has put its case into figures
and pretty large ones.. It asks for a Federal
subsidy of 255. per inhabitant per annum
or about £710,000 for the first year. A con-
densed record for six recent years helps to
shoAV why:—
1919-20. 1925-26.
Public debt £48,565,562 £81,473 62*
Interest for year .. .. 2,032,755 4,103,915
Debt per head ' .. .. £9B 811 £145 17 8
Interest per head .. .. 3 14 2 6 18 11
Interest per cent. . . . . 4 3 9 5 0 9
Taxation per head . . . . 2 19 5 4 16 5
Railway (miles) . . . . 2316 2491
There isn’t much new railway to show for
all the loan money, but in that respect the
States are much alike. In six years their
“Public Works” borrowings rose from 417
millions to 642 millions, over 50 per cent.,
while the State railways grew from 21,284
miles to 23,396 miles, less than 10 per cent.
S. Australia asks for a lot, but considering
the example of Westralia this isn’t unnatu-
ral. Unfortunately for Butler’s State, the
Federal Government has given so much, and
promised so much, including things which
were none of its business, that its wallet
has a hungry look, and it talks retrench-
ment itself.

“Prime Minister Bruce and Treasurer Page have
issued a joint appeal to the Nationalists and the
Country party to abide loyally by the Pact under
AA'hich the two parties have been co-operating since
1923. The leaders add that, if this is done, they are
confident of success in the general elections that are
due at the end of this year or the beginning of
next.”
Watch your steps, you legislators! All will
soon be gas and gaiters
In the various arenas that you more or less
adorn.
(O the savage jacket-dustings that are
coming on the hustings !
O the satire that’s a-brewing and the
brimming vials of scorn !)
Fierce as wolves in snow-clad regions,
Labor’s office-famished legions
Soon will gather for the blood-trail—ere
the year is out, in fact.
Would you give them what is due them ’fore
they know what’s coming to them?
Mind the Pact!
Would you hurl them backwards shattered,
bleeding, broken, bent and battered,
Those intent to storm the tart-shop and
its treasures to explore?
(O the schemes and plots that mull in the
resourceful brain of Scullin!
O the stubbornness of Charlton and the
Aviles of Theodore !)
Then you’ll need, for their confounding,
something more than faith abounding
In the righteous cause you fight for, some-
thing more than sav. and tact.
If you want to hold the trenches that protect
the Treasury benches
Mind the Pact!
’Ware of squabbles fratricidal, Devil’s
mischief for the idle;
All are wanted on the ramparts when the
foe is at the gate.
(O the factiousness unhalting that they’ll
bring to the assaulting!
O the venom and the passion bottled
up through ’twenty-eight!)
Nats, and Cockies, stand together and the
fiercest storm you’ll weather;
Heed the Avarning of your leaders where-

“Amity” : One of the first incidents due to
the adoption of the new “summer time” in
Maoriland was a domestic mix-up on an
Auckland wharf. On the first day of the
Sidey innovation a jealously-inclined hus-
band was about to make a short coastal trip,
and his attractive young wife went to see
him off. Unknown to her husband the lady
had made arrangements to go to the pictures
later with a pre-marriage friend, and had
asked him to collect her on the wharf an
hour after the advertised sailing-time of the
ship. Unfortunately the husband had omit-
ted to alter his watch—actually he would
have missed the boat if it had left punc-
tually—whereas the gentleman friend had
altered his. So it happened that the hus-
band, turning to wave a last farewell, beheld
his wife in the act of greeting his one-time
rival. It was the work of a moment for him
to sling his suitcase back on to the. wharf,
grasp a stanchion and clamber back into the
picture. The hurtling suitcase gave the ter-
tium quid a warning of impending danger,
and he bolted incontinently, hotly pursued.
A tearful young woman carrying a suitcase
followed in the rear of the chase,,. and the
interested spectators witnessed a crisis solely
due to the fact that one person had remem-
bered the summer-time arrangement and two
others hadn’t.

“Dr. Nil”: I read “M.G.S.’s” par. about
bird-songs (B. 8/12/27) three times before
arriving at the conclusion that he was
merely pulling our legs. Everybody knows
that no bird can produce more than one note
at a time, and thus no single bird can sing
a chord or make “harmony.” When I came
to such terms as “counterpoint” and “fugues ’
I looked eagerly forward for some reference
to figured bass and dekatonic subvolution of
the middle inverted minor fifth, but appar-
ently “M.G.S.” had not thought of that;
in any case, he succeeded quite well without
it. But the first time. I read his note I
really thought he was in earnest!

“Scot Kay” : “M.G.S.” is wrong in stating
that the late Henry Tate’s symphonic poem
“Dawn” “contained the barest suggestion of
the noises made by birds” (B. 29/12/’27).
The composition, which begins with the call
of the mopoke given out by bassoons and
basses, consists of nothing else. The writer
saw the manuscript score many times before
it was performed, heard it when it was re-
hearsed by the orchestra and. finally, wrote
it up for the Age when the work was done in
the Auditorium.
“M.G.S.”: “Malo” (B. 29/12/’27) cites the
canary as an instance of delightful bird music
(B. 29/12/’27). In a recent vaudeville turn
an entertainer had some dozens of these birds
which were supposed to sing in unison with
the piano. Actually an assistant did most
of the warbling on an instrument off-stage,
and, although he was skilled in jazz, he was
hard put to it to imitate the mindless, me-
tallic twitter characteristic of the breed. In
other words, the normal melodiousness of the
man-made instrument had to be suppressed
to simulate the alleged natural beauty of the
feathered choir. The fact is that our atti-
tude towards the birds resembles our atti-
AS NOW—AS EVER.
“Yes, but will you love me as much when we’re married?”
“Of course I will—you know I’ve always been crazy about married women”
tude towards an infant prodigy. The won-
der isn’t that they sing so well, but that
they sing at all.

“Windsor”: Like his naval brother (B.
29/12/27), the army signalman uses his
own peculiar alphabet to avoid possible con-
fusion in receiving messages. It is much
shorter and simpler, too, as this list will
demonstrate: Ack, beer, cork, don, eddy,
eft, gee, h, ink, jug, kay, ell, emma, en, o,
pip, quod, are, esses, tok, u, vik, double-u,
ex, wye and zed. It is impossible to mistake
the phonetic substitution.

“Inspector Bucket”: I read that . the
authorities at Scotland Yard have decided
to adopt the new French system of ear
identification to trace criminals.. It appears
that the ear is a distinct entity
with every individual, and as
easily identifiable as the thumb-
print. Detectives are being
taught to study the ears of their
quarry and commit them to
memory. The advantage claimed
for the new system is that the
ear is much more easily acces-
sible than the thumb, and a
note can be taken of it without
the co-operation, willing or un-
willing, of the owner. Still,
there are drawbacks to ear
identification as an exact
science. Just as a calf’s owner-
ship may be changed by the deft
use of a sharp knife, the human
ear is easily manipulated by the
ordinary surgeon, and may be
altered or clipped without
serious inconvenience, whereas
thumbs cannot be similarly
treated without handicapping
the owner. Nor are ear prints habitually left
on safes, bottles or window-panes, as finger-
prints so often are.

“Adje”: Don’t know what Digger wrote
the fewest letters, but I nominate myself as
having indited the most. For over four
years I wrote twice a week to my parents,
at least once a week to one of my four
sisters, and once a week to the girl I left
behind me. After I left Egypt for the land-
ing, I added a weekly epistle to my girl in
Egypt. After my first leave in Scotland in
September, ’l6, a further weekly letter had
to be added for my Scotch lassie. They
were genuine letters, too,, a note to my
people about my first experiences in Blighty
running to 50 pages. P.S.—I slipped on
all my fair correspondents, each of them
marrying someone else.
“Pyro”: Sydney prides itself on its sun-
shine, but as any photographer who has
snapped a shutter in both countries can tell
you, Maoriland sunshine is much more bril-
liant and has a considerably greater actinic
value. That is one of the reasons why every
Maorilander is astonished at the apparent
superior brightness of the moon in Sydney.
It’s all a matter of contrast between night
and day, and at night the Ma State’s atmos-
phere is clearer than in the daytime. Inci-
dentally, town and city street lighting in the
Shivery Isles consumes a lot more current
to the street mile than is the case in Sydney,
and Sydney streets look dark and dingy to
the visiting islander until his eyes adjust
themselves. And never, in the small Domin-
ion, do the clouds obscure light to such an
extent as often happens in Sydney, where the
shops on occasions have to turn on their
electric lights at high noon.
* * * *
“0.P.” : A paragraph I read recently about
the “improved status” of our Governor-
General reminds me of Cap’in William Henry
Tregloan, of Moonta. William Henry was in
charge of a squad of “pickey” boys and was
paid 6d. a day more than the current basic
wage of 6s. or so. In addition he was entitled
to be addressed as captain, a real distinction
in local circles at that period. With the intro-
duction of mechanical ore-dressing appliances
Cap’n’s job automatically ended, but the
manager offered him employment washing the
underground clothes of the bosses at the same
rate of pay, but without his old title. As an
alternative, William was informed, he could
retain the title by working for 6d. less.
“Plaze, sir, thank ’ee, I’ll taake the sixpence
less and kape me stattus” was the sentence
with which negotiations were concluded.

“Carisbrook, Jun.” : It isn’t quite correct
to say that not so much as a plank of the
ill-fated Koombana was ever found (B.
22/12/’27). The Bullara brought in several
pieces of wreckage to Broome; these, along
with an armchair and the top of a card-
table picked up by a pearling lugger, were
stored in the jetty-shed for years after the
disaster of March, 1912. A more notable
fact is that though there were over 180
aboard not one body was recovered. Yet on
the beach between Wallal and Lagrange
Bay, after the 1910 willy-willy, scores of
corpses were washed from wrecked pearling
luggers.
THE LADY ANGELINE.
[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
I’m a democratic Digger
’Oo ain’t shook on the Nobs;
Let the jumped-ups cut a figger,
I got no time for snobs.
But Angeline, sweet Angeline,
My beauteous ! My pearl!
’Oo taught me just what love could mean,
’Er uncle was a nearl.
She was neater than a fairy,
More lovely than a rose,
With a voice like a canary
And a little tilted nose.
Oh, scarlet lips is passing sweet
When cheeks is smooth and fair.
’Er sparklin’ eyes ! ’Er dainty feet!
’Er wondrous golden ’air!
Invited to baronial ’alls,
Us convalescent Digs
Was comforted with ’one.v balls,
With ginger pops and cigs.,
While lovely tabs of noble mien
Sat shyly by our sides.
Bli-me, but it was easy seen
They’d never be our brides.
Sweet Angeline of all the mob
Was fairest far to see,
And when wild notes of music throb
She swiftly turns to me
’Oose leg was crook, ’oose feet was slow;
But as I ’eld ’er tight
And jazzed a bit, she whispered low
“I’m all alone ter-night.”
“O lovely Lady Angeline,
’Tis wrong to tempt me so ;
A blinkin’ Digger, O my queen,
We didn’t ought to go !”....
But she was merry ’earted,
A nepitome of bliss,
And ere I’d fairly started
She stops me with a kiss.
The limousine purred to the night
As in me arms she clung,
Drenching me soul with pure delight—
Oh! but the world was young;
A LATER DISCOVERY.
GLADYS: “Was it a case of love, at first sight with you and your husband?”
ANGELA: “Oh no, dear; I didn’t know he had money until some time after.”
And I—l was her lover —
For me ’er bright eyes shone,
And no-one but a shover
To act as chaperone !
I'm a democratic Digger
’Oo ain’t, shook on the Nobs;
Let the jumped-ups cut a figger,
I got no time for snobs.
But Angeline, sweet Angeline,
My beauteous! My pearl!
’Oo taught me just what love could mean
’Er uncle was a nearl.
S.A.
WILLIAM JAMES DIGGER.


“Carisbrook Jun.”: “Bill O’G.’s” Mel-
bourne postal official (B. 22/12/’27) was
justified in refusing a telegram addressed
simply to “Burnside,” as he takes his in-
structions from Commonwealth P. and T.
Regulations. It is quite different with
overseas cables or radios; these are accepted
subject to the International Regulations
framed at Berne in 1912 and recently
amended at Washington U.S. A telegram
addressed from any office in the world to
Sydney would reach its destination in
N.S.W., but a message intended for the
town of the same name in Nova Scotia
would have to be addressed, in accordance
with International Regulations, to Sydneyns.
Similarly the three Australian Gladstones
are Gladstone, Gladstonesa, and Gladstone-
tasmania.

“Doric” : Donald was 55; when he came
to Australia he had left his fiancee behind
him, with the promise to send for her as
soon as he had made good. The process
took 20 years, but he kept liis word, and
the neighbors in the country town were agog
with sentiment and excitement when they
heard that Maggie was to arrive that day.
They were all at the station to see the
greeting between the old sweethearts, but
when a plump, matronly woman, well in her
forties, stepped off the train, Donald’s loud
greeting was lacking in the romantic note.
“Weel, Maggie,” lie boomed, “but yeir na sae
bonnie as ye used to be!” It was too
late for him to wriggle out of matrimony,
however, even had he so desired; for, possibly
anticipating some such contingency, Maggie
had brought his letters with her.
* * * *
“Old King Cole” : One of the oldest land-
marks in Melbourne' is threatened with ex-
tinction, the Mitre tavern in Bank-place, off
Collins-street. Opened back in the ’forties, it
was named after the London house that has
been famous since the days of Dr. Johnson,
and except for the absence of sand on the
floor it might have been a typical London
chop-house. It is proposed to turn Froedel’s
big prin tery opposite the Mitre into a
hotel and transfer the Mitre license across
the lane. The Mitre caters chiefly for city
men—lawyers, accountants, real-estaters,
mining investors and all the class of people
which likes a good dinner in a peaceful
retreat.
* * * *
“Gouger” : Speaking of gruesome relics on
church premises (B. 24/11/’27), Sibui Pui
(the Tree of Skulls) shades the church-door
on Boigu Island, Torres Strait. On this
huge tree the head-hunters hung their
trophies for unknown years, festooning its
branches after every successful raid. And
lying beside the church now under construc-
tion at Cocoanut Island is the sawn-off half
of a canoe. Several of the old die-hards, now
laying a brick for Christianity, will still tell
you with a certain pride how many heads
that canoe brought back from successful
raids in the good old days. .It is now used
for mixing mortar in.
* * * *
“R. 8.” : No place of worship in the Com-
monwealth is richer in artistic associations
than the Patterson Memorial Chapel on Nor-
folk Island, built almost entirely by Solo-
mon Islanders of the Melanesian Mission.
Lhe organ was the gift of Miss Charlotte
Yonge, a novelist dear to our grandparents,
lhe five stained-glass windows were designed
by Burne-Jones and made at William
Morris’s factory. The gold and silver tab-
lets and ornaments on walls and altar would
make some cathedral accessories look tawdry,
and every seat-end is panelled with beauti-
fully carved mother-of-pearl, the work of
the Solomon boys. To-day the headquarters
of the mission is at Santa Cruz, and the
precious chapel is seldom opened for service
the ordinary Anglican devotions being held on
the second storey of what was once the
convict commissariat.
* * * *
“E.S.S.” : The holiday spirit has two sides.
One is uppermost in the morning, going out,
when men gallantly help strange women
into tram and train, surrendering seats to
them and finding apparent enjoyment in
standing. If one asks for a match, half a
dozen are eager to oblige him, and the chances
are that someone will say, “Have a cigar?”
Nobody is inconvenienced by being jambed
m the crowd or having his toes trodden on :
he laughs and cracks jokes about it. The
roads are good, the weather lovely, and it is
a beautiful country. On the way home the
other spirit rules. The man who gave up his
seat to the old lady going out now makes
scramble to get there before her. Xf some-
Body bumps against him he is apt to make dis-
agreeable remarks, and if lie tries to borrow a
match he is liable to hear somebody mumble,
“Go and buy matches.” The roads are a
disgrace to the local council, the weather is
beastly, and the slightest hitch in the tram
service arouses a general desire to lynch
the Commissioners.
* * * *
“Herodot”: Mt. Gambier isn’t the only
place in Australia where well-sinking has an
extra-special risk attached to it (B.
30/12/’27). In the Mount Oxide district of
Northern Queensland a well was down about
80 feet wdien the underground cavity was
reached. In that case the luckless sinker
disappeared, as well as the tools ; the victim
could have had no warning whatever of his
fate, for he had just finished driving through
a clay stratum that appeared solid enough.
Unsuccessful attempts were subsequently
made to plumb the depth of the black cavity,
there was a faint sound that suggested run-
ning water far below. Finally tlie sinister
hole was covered over with thick timbers and
a layer of dirt placed atop.
* * * *
“Ava”: When the results of a recent
examination came out, but before they were
officially confirmed, my friend Bill, who stut-
ters lamentably, went to break the news to
his father. The old man had spent a lot of
money on Bill, and his opinion of his son’s
ability and application was not high. “Dad,
I believe I’ve f-f-f” began Bill. “What?”
roared his. father. “You good-for-nothing
idiot! This comes of not working hard
enough. I said ail along” “They say I’ve
PUNT ABOUT.
"The wharf laborers having called off their Christmas strike and promised to obey the award the
seamen have flouted their award, and started a New Year’s strike.”
WHARFIE: “There y’ are, Bill; your turn ter put the boot in.”
f-f-f-f”- “Don’t say it again,” shouted his
parent furiously. “Once is enough. Well,
it’s your last chance. You can go off to the
country next week. What did you fail in?”
“I didn’t f-f-f-f” Bill tried to explain.
“Well, what did you say you did for?” de-
manded the old man. Bill took a breath and
made a desperate .effort. “They say I’ve
finished first,” he blurted out. “Wei],'” said
the old man, returning to the paper, “why
couldn’t you say so?”

“C.” : To the list of believers in the sing-
ing qualities of birds (B. 29/12/’27) add
Josephine Heysen, ornithologist and daughter
of artist Hans, and H. Brewster-Jones,
Adelaide pianist. Josephine has studied for
some years the individual characters and sur-
roundings of the 88 different kinds of S.A.
birds; her collaborator’s part has been to
register, with the aid of bis tuning-pipe, the
note of each songster. The result is that
all the birds’ calls have been set to music.

“R. Volt”: The latest news in the art
world is that a new test, compounded of the
X- and ultra-violet rays, has been applied
to the Old Masters in the Louvre, of which
there are upwards of 9000. Of the bulk of
the results the authorities say naught but
they couldn’t help blurting out that the Mona
Lisa had stood the strain, that lady of the
enigmatic smile having been under suspicion
ever since she was stolen by an Italian
patriot and recovered in an attic. The
silence as to the rest suggests that the buyers
for the great Parisian gallery have had their
legs pulled by the picture-fakers on occasion,
too. If those learned connoisseui-s living in
the heart of things can have made mistakes,
it would not be surprising if Australian col-
lections such as the Felton Bequest had
been even more befooled. The Yic. National
Gallery should apply the test at once, and
the pictures that fail to sustain it should be
hurried out of sight to make way for a few
new Australian masters. As far as is known,
nobody has tried to make an imitation
Streeton, Ililder or Mclnnes.
* * -* *
“Tahune”: Hobart’s Cascade Brewery,
after a long monopoly, has a competitor;
wherefore the old firm has taken off its shirt
and got busy. It has expended £lBB,OOO in
laying out tlie most up-to-date plant in the
Commonwealth, not, it is explained, so much
because of the new rival, but as an effort to
arrest some of the £120,000 which Victorian
breweries have been raking in annually from
Speck fi’othblowers. The Cascade, which
started in 1824, is the oldest established
business of the sort in Australia. Its product
was exported to Sydney 98 years ago, and
might have gone to other Australian capitals
had they been in existence.
* ❖ ❖ %
“Mako” : Something unique in the way of
a motor-thief turned up in the Maoriland
village of Thames the other morning, when
a well-known doctor awoke at dawn to the
conviction that his new car was being pur-
loined. The miscreant was a Maori, who,
with all lights on, was making desperate
efforts to get the car out of the garage. To
facilitate this he blew the horn loudly at
intervals and shouted encouragement to him-
self, the commotion finally bringing the police
and various neighbors to assist in his cap-
ture. Henare fought two constables with
great enthusiasm before he was lodged in the
police-station; he is now in a mental hos-
pital.
❖ :Jc
“Amity”: Romance, of course, is every-
where, but the people who saw a young
woman faint the other day on the steps of
Sydney’s G.P.O. could hardly have known
that they were so close to it. In the war
years a Maoriland girl engaged herself to a
young corporal; she was so harassed during
his absence in France by her parents’ disap-
proval that on his return she broke off the
engagement. . The ex-corporal went back
to England, joined a firm in which an uncle
was a partner, and was recently sent out to
further business interests in Australia. The
girl recently came to Sydney on a health
trip, and unexpectedly met her ex-fiance on
the steps of the G.P.O. She promptly
fainted. On her recovery in a near-by alcove
she learned that he was leaving Sydney in a
couple of days; and while the general 'public
unlocked p.-o. boxes and licked stamps in
dusty proximity, the couple arranged a hasty
wedding for next day. Within an hour an
urgent cable informed the family in Christ-
church that their interference of a decade
ago had been wasted effort.
* H* * Hi
“C. Jumper”: “Harold Hardupp” (B.
5/l/’2B) isn’t quite right ' about “spiffs.”
A “spiff” wasn’t, as he seems to think, a
commission on any sale. Certain articles
which had been long in stock and had proved
hard to sell were nominated as “spiffs,” and
the reward for selling was either a pre-
arranged sum or everything over a certain
minimum price that the assistant could
extract from the customer.
“Nitric”: The aeroplane was put to its
latest use in Australia when a “Qantas”
machine was converted into a thief-chaser.
Four men had perpetrated several robberies
at Camooweal (Q.), and escaped from that
town by a stolen car. They made a dash
into the Northern Territory, but were located
by the ’plane containing police officers. When
bailed up the runaways objected to being
arrested by Queensland police outside of
that State and the officers of the law re-
spected their objections. They w r ere quite
safe in conceding the point, for the nearest
water was in Queensland, and thither the
fugitives presently headed, to be seized in
strict accordance with warrant.
“Strict Veg.”: Melbourne’s
New Year Eve was the most
extraordinary on record. Early
iu the morning Central Aus-
tralia arrived in the shape of
aii immense cloud of red sand
which hung over the city—and,
in fact, over all Victoria and
Bass Strait as well —all day.
In the evening it came lower,
and motor-lamps threw almost
blood-colored rays over pedes-
trians, while several cars col-
lided in the pink fog. Just as
midnight rang out the Old Year
the wind changed to the south
and rain fell. Girls’ print frocks
were converted into slimy terra-
cotta ruins, and men contem-
plated white sliirt-frouts which
looked like pavements in the
betel-chewing districts of Singa-
pore. House roofs, windows and
gardens acquired a briglit-pink
hue, and the soil of paddocks
and the surfaces of roads re-
tained it for days. One re-
ligious denomination, which had
just finished a watch-night ser-
vice when the red rain began
to fall, solemnly trooped back
into their chapel there to await
what they were convinced was
the end of the world.
* X *
“Q.N.” : There are more pro-
fits and far less risk in pretend-
ing to be a shoplifter than in
shoplifting, as some of Mel-
bourne’s big stores are having
impressed on them. This is the
simple way of it. A well-
dressed woman comes in, wear-
ing a suspiciously capacious
coat, and choosing a spot where
She is well under a shopwalker’s
feye, starts fingering the goods
in the intervals of looking fur-
tively around her. The shop-
walker keeps a watchful eye on
her ; presently some act intended
to look compromising by the
woman, who has turned her
back' to him, decides him to re-
quest her to come to the office.
She refuses ; the house detective
is called, and she is taken there.
At first she refuses to be
searched, but finally permits it.
Nothing is found on her, for
the very good reason that she
took nothing. She is ushered
out with profuse apologies, but
in due course the firm gets a
solicitor’s letter demanding dam-
ages for assault and false im-
prisonment. And the firm whose
servants have laid their hands
on the schemer, and have “im-
prisoned” her in the firm’s office,
generally finds it cheapest to
pay up.

“C.Q.” : The Pensions depart-
ment in Melbourne got the sur-
prise of its life recently when
it found itself the richer by £5O
as the result of an' old-age pen-
sioner’s will. The grateful lady
had been drawing £1 a week
since 1921 and apparently found
the amount more than she
needed.

“Fashionable London has exploited the aquarium
for its latest notion in hats.”
Man has liis lobster nose,
Youth is a love-sick prawn ;
And fatheads by the hose
Of ladies now are drawn.
So why not fishy hats
Of flounder, bream or trout?
For love is blind as bats—
Through scaly eyes, no doubt.
Why not a trumpeter
For ma-in-law’s chapeau?
A perch or skate for her
Who travels to and fro.
A lung-fish for the lark
Who trills both night and day;
A blackfish for the dark,
And for the blonde a ’ray.
For Mrs. Nagg a carp,
Or else a parrot-fish,
And then a jewfish harn
To suit the Yiddish vish.
But though each fish in rote
Will make its head debut.
There’s one they’ll never tote—-
The catfish is taboo!

“Verri” : Although it is probably unaware
of the distinction, Albany (W.A.) is the
Australian town that was marked for enemy
bombardment during war-time. After the dis-
posal of the Emden the Maunganui took

aboard, among others, a youthful German
officer -whose cheerful candor revealed several
interesting points to his Maoriland cus-
todians. He stated it was the skipper of
the Emden’s intention to get among the
troopships at night, when, remarked the
youth, “we could fire at everything and
you could fire at nothing.” To this end the
battleship had called in to do a little pre-
liminary damage at Cocos Islands. Had her
night raid come off successfully the reward
to her company was to be the bombardment
of an Australian town, and to Albany had
fallen the honor of being selected.

“Mac”: The wife of our local Boniface
had a new one put over her on Christmas
Eve. A small boy came into the bottle
department with 11s. 6d. wrapped in a piece
of paper and asked for a bottle of whisky for
dad. “What sort?” asked the lady. “I
forget,” answered the lad. “Lawfords, Blue
and Black, William the Second, Grey
Horse?” suggested Mrs. Publichouse. “I
think it was Grey Horse,” came the reply.
A bottle of that brand was duly wrapped
up and handed over; the boy returned about
10 minutes later with his purchase still
apparently intact and a piece of paper on
which was written, “The kid made a bloomer.
Please give him Lawfords.” The exchange
was made and the bottle of Grey Horse went
back to its stable. Just before 11 that night
an infuriated customer arrived to remark
that when he sent for Grey Horse whisky
he didn’t expect to get a sanguinary Grey
Horse bottle filled with burnt sugar and
water. It took three drinks and a fresh
bottle to quieten him, and a notice now
appears in the bottle department, “Under
No Circumstance Will Bottles Be Ex-
changed.”

“Henry Horsecollar”: It is alleged that
Kay, late of the N.S.W. Meat Board, will

George Y. himself, sitting on his throne in

It looks a mean proceeding, for George isn’t
so young as he was, being now
in his 63rd year, and he has
troubles of his own. Questions
are still raised as to whether his
ancestor, son of John of Ghent
and Catherine Swynford, was
properly legitimatised in 1397.
If he wasn’t the position is
serious, and it is aggravated by
the suspicion that another an-
cestor, Owen Tudor, wasn’t mar-
ried at all, but merely lived with
the lady. And a great part of
the money which Charles 11.
stole from the goldsmiths of
London is not yet repaid, so
that the throne is still in pawn, so to speak.

“Nikko”: I am still wondering if the
woman I met in the Darlinghurst tram
carried out her good intentions. Her com-
panion was a bored-looking man, and an
equally-bored company listened to her mono-
logue, which ran on without pause. “I must
do it,” she said emphatically. “I really
must. Some people mightn’t like to, but I
feel it my duty. He’s getting that dissipated
look I don’t like, and going all puffy round
the eyes. Yes, I feel I must do it. I’ll do
it to-night.” “Do what?” snapped the man
suddenly. Her reply galvanised the whole
compartment to breathless interest. “Why,”
said she, “I’m going to write to the Prince
of Wales and advise him to leave off wash-
ing his face with soap !”

“Count Drolatique”: The deadliness of
Canberra (B. 29/12/’27) adds steadily to
the sordid profits of Queanbeyan. All who
are thirsty or are heavily laden with ennui
continue to drift into the little village for
things that are
only obtainable
sub rosa in the
Garden City. The
main street of
Queanbeyan on a
Saturday after-
noon, with the
beer-pumps squeak-
ing in the agony of
over-exertion and
the Bungs raking
in money with
both hands, is one
of the sights of the
Commonwealth.
Still, Queanbeyan
is seven miles from
the capital, and
those who jib at the
journey can have
the grog in their
rooms, despite the
ukases of the Fed-
eral Capital Com-
mission. I stayed
in Canberra re-
cently, and ad-
jacent to me was a
collection of bloods who nightly hit the
bottle with enthusiasm and assailed the
welkin with blithered song.
“Mars” : The first intimation I had that
our milk-oli had disposed of his round was
last Sunday morning, when an oily-looking
Dago called to supply our lacteal needs.
Having filled my jug, lie was replacing the
measure on the side of the can when it fell
into the milk. Without a moment’s hesita-
tion he dived his dirt-encrusted hand into
the fluid up to the elbow, and after a few
seconds’ search triumphantly brought up the
measure. I was offering up a silent thanks-
giving that I had been served before rescue
operations took place when Giovanni spoiled
it. “Dat the four time heem fall in to-day,”
he told me querulously.

“Basra” : Ex-King Hussein, of Mecca, was
doubtfully the legitimate Caliph of Islam, even
if he was the oldest living descendant of
Mohammed (B. 29/12/’27L The office of
THE DEFICIT.
“I suppose you and Teddy are out a good deal now that you’ve got a car?”
“Oh, yes—pounds and pounds.”
,Caliph, or spiritual head of Islam, has always
been filled by election, and the temporal head
had the best chance of being chosen, since he
possessed the power to enforce his authority.
Although the Turkish Sultans never risked a
popular election they have always gone
through the formality of .election bv the wise
men of Constantinople. If the descendants
of Mohammed ever had any hereditary rights
to the Caliphate they surrendered them in
1521, when the Caliph Mutawakkul assigned
his claims to Suleiman the Magnificent.
Hussein, as “Sol M..” says, soon lost the
throne to which Britain had assisted him in
return for his support in the war. He lost it
to Ibn Saud, Sheik of the Wahabis, and
apparently he lost his Caliphate as well,
whatever that may have amounted to, for a
person named Abdul Mejid, of Angora, is
now generally recognised as Caliph of Islam.
Hussein’s present address is Cyprus.

“C.Q.”: Touching female impersonators
of male parts, a case has just come
Off the ice in Melbourne. The lady
clothed her mature charms of 28 years in
knickerbockers, golf stockings and the badge
of a Sydney school. She did it so well that
for several weeks she bluffed the small boys
who were her principal acquaintances in
accepting her as one of themselves. An
adult detected the fraud by the masquera-
der’s voice.
* * * #
“X.D.” : The most barefaced abandonment
of the unwanted infant to date occurred in
Richmond (Melb.) on a recent Friday
(shopping-) night. A woman was standing
waiting for a tram when a perfectly strange
lady rushed up and, pointing excitedly at
two figures in the distance, cried, “Look!
There’s my husband with another woman.
Hang on to these for a minute while I nab
them.” Then she dumped a baby and a
parcel into the other’s arms, dashed up the
street, jumped into a waiting car and dis-
appeared. The recipient of this New Year
gift has a husband out of work and 12
kids of her own,

“Gregor”: The year just closed was not
a good one for the Sydney police. There
were four murders during the latter part of
the year which have not yet been sheeted
home to anybody. In only one case, the
slaying of Ronald Leslie on the Blue Moun-
tains, were arrests made, but the suspects
were acquitted by a jury. The other three
mysteries that remain unsolved were the
killing of Norman Bruhn in Surry Hills,
the murder of the moneylender Condon in
one of the busiest parts of the city in the
middle of the day, and the brutal battering
to death of a woman at Aslifield. In each
case the police found themselves against a
blank wall. The killing of Bruhn was un-
doubtedly an act of gang-vengeance, and all
the indications suggest that the moneylender
Condon was murdered by a client rendered
reckless by financial difficulties, but in
neither case did the detectives find anybody
to put them on the. trail of the perpetrator.
There is no doubt whatever that the police
force is undermanned, one detective fre-
quently being loaded with enough work for
half a dozen.
* * * *
“Silentio”: Touching the suspicion with
which unfamiliar gold coins are regarded by
the younger generation (B. 15/12/’27). In
our local store last week a well-educated 18-
year-old girl asked for change of a pound
note, and received ten bob in silver and a
half-sovereign. She counted it twice and
then complained to the assistant that he
had given her only ten-and-sixpence. High
words followed, and the young lady refused
to be pacified until the boss came up and
explained that what she had taken for six-
pence was a gold coin worth 10s.
* * *
“Strict Veg.” : The world’s most consider-
ate suicide said good-bye to life in Mel-
bourne the other day. He wrote a note to a
friend, asking him to call, and then put a
gas-jet in his mouth. An alarm-clock,
arranged to cut off the flow when it had
served its turn, was attached to the gas.
UNITIL DEATH OR-
[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
“ ‘Companionate [probationary] marriages’ are
becoming such a vogue in New York that they may
supplant in a very short time the orthodox marriage
ceremony. The new marriage service has the words
‘until death or disinclination to live together do
us part.’ ”
Conte, lads and lasses, to your joyous mating
With never thought of penalty or pain;
Here’s wedlock sans the “lock” that you were
hating,
Here’s matrimony minus ball and chain!
(th. weary was the way our parents padded,
By stringent service shackled from the
start,
But now a few improving words we’ve
added
And swear to cling together, heart to
heart—
Till death (or disinclination to live together,
or a desire to sample someone elsc’s
kisses, or the sight of a larger bank-
book looking around for a little com-
panion) do us part.
Come, men and maidens, flat are all the
fences
That brought you croppers on the nuptial
course;
No more await the hideous expenses
Of annual or biennial divorce.
We’ve dealt it out to ritual old-fashioned,
W e’ve doctored ancient vows to make ’em
smart;
Ah, sweet, can you resist my plea impas-
sioned ?
Come live with me and be my love, dear
heart—-
Till death (or distaste for spotted ties or
speckled garters, or a one-sided parti-
ality to onions, or the dread of being-
considered really and stupidly mar-
ried) do us part!
VICTORIA.
HASEN.
MORE COURT VIGNETTES.
[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
The Clerk is just a handy man who humblj
tills his station.
Ho calls the witness and demands his name
and his vocation
And whispers in his Honor’s ear
Things we are never meant to hear,
Perhaps polite evasion.
He marks exhibits “A” and “B” and where
to be returned,
And tells the Judge what follows next, a
routine he has learned.
Dispassionate amid the fray,
His benediction ends the day,
'“This Court now stands adjourned.”
The Tipstaff shows their Honors in and out
beneath his wing
While shouting “Silence!” I confess I know
no other thing
He does, except for swank High Courts
(Distinguished from inferior sorts)
He adds “God Save the King!”
There’s no one, poor or plutocrat, that I
desire to rob.
To envy one who’s better placed but marks
the social snob;
But the Tipstaff makes me wish at times
He had the task of writing rhymes
And I his cushy job.

lAN Dto Egypt Coals to Newcastle Whisky to Australia the principle
remains the same. Egypt’s sand is as good as any. Newcastle coal is second
to none. Australian whisky has no superior. And Australian whisky means
OLD COURT Whisky.
OLD COURT claims to be the world’s pure St. It has earned the right to that
claim. In the paSt few months OLD COURT issued a £lOOO challenge to any
who could prove it otherwise. The challenge has never been taken up.
The non acceptance of the challenge has reacted in favor of OLD COURT Whisky.
Sales have grown and grown. But many Australians have yet to learn that the
whisky distilled in Australia is as fine in quality as the best imported. They are
those who have never tried OLD COURT.
Despite Old Court’s increasing popularity, Australia lost £1,875,000 last year by
drinking imported whisky. Why let this waste continue? Why let prejudice
affect both national industry and individual pocket? Shipping sand to Egypt and
whisky to Australia are equally illogical.

In comparing last year’s income with that
<>>' the previous terms it has to be remem-
bered that in 1925, when the Australian
business of the New York Life was taken
over, no less than £645,097 was received for
reassurance, and £7186 came from the same
source in the following term, whereas last
year's figures got no help in that direction.
Setting aside reassurances, the year’s im-
provement amounted to £305,356 compared
with £439,561 in 1926. Premium income
(£2,957,870) accounted for £199,802 of it,
and the balance (£105,554) came from
interest, rents, etc. (£1,420,925). Business
has grown so rapidly that the present income
is more than double that of 1919; that is
to say, in eight years the association has
doubled the income which was the result of
over half a century’s endeavor. One factor
that helped the later figures along was the
solid blocks of insurance digested when the
Australian businesses of the Equitable and
later the New York Life were swallowed.
Another is the wide field over which policies
are written. More than a third "of the
annual income is gathered outside Australia
—from Maoriland, 8. Africa, Britain. Ire-
land, India, Ceylon and the Straits Settle-
ments. Whether it is all of a quality equal
to the Australian business and got at the
same cost is another matter.
Of the £8,234,713 additional cover taken
out under 16,793 policies last year, which
is £470,803 more than was written under
16,494 policies in 1926, only 6.7 p.c. was
endowment. The average per life policy was
£477. an increase of no less than £45 over
the 1924 average. What it cost to handle
the business is shown in the next compari-
son. The calculations are based on the
assumption that old business eats up 7 p.c.
of the renewal premiums and that single pre-
miums cost 3 p.c.; the balance of the
year’s exes, is charged against new busi-
ness :

There are few offices that can show better:
<57.2 p.c. means that very nearly a third of
last year’s new premiums at once begin to
earn something against the inevitable day
when policies become claims. Here is a
costs view of the business as a whole: —-
Expenses Compared with Total Income.

1922. . 9 16 2 „ j 1927.. 8 10 2 „
That £8 10s. 2d. is an exceptionally low
rate and places the National amongst Aus-
tralia’s best. The office reserves about 181
p.c. of the annual premium income against
future exes, and contingencies. Last year
the ratio of exes. to net premium
income was 14.6 p.c. compared with 14.6
p.c. and 14.7 p.c. in the two preceding terms.
That does not include single premiums and
annuities; obviously the saving is sub-
stantial and should materially enhance bonus
prospects. Claims (£1,882,250) were £127,190
heavier, but there was over four and a
quarter million more at risk than in the pre-
vious year. The mortality, however, was only
58 p.c. of what was figured on. It was
61 p.c. of expectation in 1926. Hence the
office will receive more premiums than it
counted upon, and interest earnings will
benefit by the amount realised on the sus-
pended payments.

Most of the two millions-odd added to the
funds during the year went into mortgages
(£7,821,143, up £1,041,053) and loans on
policies (£3,757,377, up £592,762), and that
helped the year’s expansion of £105,413 in
net interest, etc. But in part because the
money put into the new Brisbane, London and
Bloemfontein properties was not earning for
the full term, the return on mean funds
slipped back 9d.: —

However, the office bases its actuarial cal-
culations on a future net return of ony 34
p.c. With the mortality margin and the
cut in exes., that simply must mean better
bonuses.

Amalgamated Textiles (Australia),
Ltd., which operates mills at Albury and
Orange, was registered in N. S. Waies in
March, 1923, with a nominal capital of
£1,000,000, of which £750,000 was offered.
After some initial difficulties that threatened
the co. with disaster had been overcome, the
top-making section of the Albury plant began
work early in 1925. But the full plant, in-
cluding the worsted and woollen sections, was
not earning until September, 1926, and at
Orange, where worsteds and a few woollens
are made, full production was not reached
until the beginning of last year. Thus
equipped, and with wool at a steady figure
and the benefit of a slight improvement in the
tariff, it was generally expected that the co.
would advance to the' profit-earning stage in
its last term, ended September 30. Paid
capital was then £442,519, and there was
£43,835 of calls in arrears, the residue of an
unpaid £87,075 on the books at September
30, 1926, mainly the result of the eo.’s fail-
ure to establish works at Tamworth. The
year’s sales climbed £62,201, reaching
£129,951; but the accounts were still ±940
short. And that was after £7BSI had been
capitalised on account of losses at the Orange
mill for the six months to March 25. Thus
the actual loss on the year’s operations was
£8829, which followed losses of £16,989 in
1926; £17,338 in 1925; £4256 in 1924.
The looms at Orange and Albury did not
consume the whole of the tops from the
Albury combing section. For a while the
surplus was sold to Japan, but during the
greater part of the year the tops market was
stagnant, so the section was run at a loss.
Then owing to delays in getting patterns out
the co. missed the season’s market, and by
the end of June there were not sufficient
orders on hand to keep the plant going. Man-
agement was the trouble, the chairman says.
The auditors were called in, a change was
made in the control and the trading position
over the last half of the term distinctly
improved. The losses for the first six months
amounted to £6295, for the next three months
£2031 and for the last quarter £503. Plant
had been neglected, and textile machinery
calls for a pretty heavy maintenance bill; •
so that chewed into the year’s earnings. Plant
is now said to be in first-class order and,
for the first time, all running. Future profits
will partly depend upon whether the pro-
vision for depreciation hitherto has been
adequate.

The new money that came in during the
year went mostly into plant, stocks and
book debts. There was nothing uneasy in the
financial position. The trade debt (£17,437)
increased £9lBB, a trifle was knocked off the
overdraft (£33,429) and to meet the two
there was £108,719 in stocks, book debts and
cash. The improvement in the more or less
liquid surplus (£57,853) amounted to
£25,992. The basis on which stocks were
valued is not stated, but the wool and cloth
markets are firm. The intangibles are con-
spicuous : they represent 3s. Sd. per fully-
paid share: and whether the remaining
16s. 4d. will be able to earn sufficient to pay
a decent div. on the full pound remains to
be seen. Subject to that the co.’s prospects
are by no means discouraging. Production
now appears to be well in hand, and pro-
vided sufficient orders can be won to keep
the plant going (and that should be easily
possible), and provided costs are kept back,
the next accounts should show further
definite improvement.

The business is growing, and the year was
really better than those figures suggest. The
1926 profits included a surplus of £1286 on the
sale of property, whereas last year the plant
replacement reserve (£3697) —it is included
with reserves above, hence movements there-
in affect profits—was drawn upon for £1303.
Including the 10 p.c. div. from the West-
ralian offshoot, in which £13,334 is invested,
gross profits moved up £2952, reaching
£45,212,. and exes. (£30.929) gobbled 68.4
p.c. of it compared with 70.1 p.c. in the.
previous year. However, the p.c. to
shareholders called for less than three-
quarters of the year’s final result (£12,980) ,
which was equal to 17.3 p.c. on capital com-
pared with 18.5, 19, IS.B, 23.6, 16.8, 5.2
and 20.2 p.c. back as far as 1920. And
£47,039 of reserves have been accumulated
to assist the £75,000 of paid capital. During
the year it was decided to extend manufac-
turing to Brisbane, where a property has
been purchased, and the new plant was ex-
pected to be at work last month.
That and other movements are reflected
in balance-sheet figures :

The book value of premises, in at valuation
(£39.203), increased a mere £4403, and
£6485 more was spent on plant than was
written off; but only £4537 was added to the
debt, making it £12,898. The co. drew upon
its own liquids for £1616; thus the more
or less liquid surplus, including stocks but
excluding shares in other cos., was reduced
to £40.335 ; and that was equal to 10s. 9d.
per share. Competition in the trade is
pretty keen, but the co. has shown that it
can win its share, and assets appear to be
conservatively valued. On the market-
buyers offer 365. for the scrip, which has a
backing of 325. ,6d. in net tangibles. The
return to the investor at that price is
6.7 p.c. on a 121 p.c. div. basis.

For the last three years the co. has been
able to ride along on an even keel. The 10
p.c. div. in 1925 involved an assault on the
reserves, and in accordance with its fixed
policy the board dropped the ord. div. to
8 p.c. in 1926, the lowest rate since the
war and British control of food prices made
meat-freezing and -export a really lucrative
business. After the Lord Mayor’s show
comes the dust-cart; but the South Island
concern is well entrenched behind its war
profits, and since it has not, like less favor-
ably situated concerns in the Shivery Isles,
had to borrow money, the deflation of values
in the Dominion during the last 18 months
has helped rather than otherwise. The
course of the market for the co.’s products
has not shown, any very alarming variations ;
and while the year’s net .earnings represent
a very modest return on the mean funds
available, they are sufficient to pay the
reduced dividend and to provide an addition
to reserves that bring them above the 1920
level.
The reduction of liabilities goes on
steadily; and while the decrease in the book
value of works, plant and land as set forth
in the balance-sheet—£699s for the year—
may be a just reflection of the general
depreciation in values, it probably errs on
the right side. The Canterbury’s investment
in war loan, its one and only venture of the
kind (investment was compulsory), stays on
the books and seems likely to stay there till
date of redemption. The following table
shows how sails have been trimmed in the
last few y.ears :

The Canterbury is one of the institutions
that help to give the South Island its prized
description of “solid.” Its directors are
all drawn from the province’s foremost land-
owning families—the Deanses and Griggs
were pioneer settlers —and it has shown
no strong desire, even amid the temptations
of the war boom, to enlarge or water its
capital. Less than £20,000 of capital has
been asked for in the last 12 years, and
while the going was good a substantial
amount of profit was tucked away where it
wouldn’t be obtrusive. Shareholders who
deemed the management unduly conservative
at a time when lamb was almost worth its
weight in coinage have now reason to rejoice,
for the Canterbury has weatherd a storm that
has sent many another apparently stout craft
on its beam ends. These be lean years for
the meat preservers, but if better times come
the C.F.M.C. will .be on deck with a couple
of hands open to salvage the golden shower.

Gross profit (£26,615) was £309 poorer ; the
year’s slight improvement in net earnings is
the result of a small. cut in exes., which
ate 77.7 of gross compared with 78.5 p.c. in
the previous year. The National does not
publish the volume of trusts in hand; but
while it appears to have a very solid little
business and has paid a long run of good
divs., sweetened by two gift issues which
make the present 12 p.c. equal to 15 p.c. to
old holders, it has never been a great money-
spinner. But things are improving: the
£5653 netted last year was 8 p.c. on capital
and reserves combined compared with 7.9,
8, 6 and 6.1 p.c. back to 1923. They must
■earn 61 p.c. to pay a 12 p.c. div. Obviously a
nice little block of business came into the
office three years ago.
For some time the co.’s premises have not
brought in a fair return on the capital in-
vested ; difficulties arising out of “ancient
lights” stood in the wav of a remedy, but last
year that difficulty was overcome by the pur-
chase of an adjoining property, and the
board went to its bankers for £47,512 to do
it:—

Freeholds are in at cost (£108.646, up

is to build up-to-date offices “as soon as a
favorable opportunity arises.” Shareholders
no doubt will be asked to assist. A little
over a year ago the board undertook to endow

Capital is £37,500 in 75,000 £2 shares paid
to 10s. The net tangible backing was ISs. 6d.

Vale of Clwydd, Litligow (N.S.W.), whose
present capital is £60,000 in 90,000 shares
of 13s. 4d. each, proposes to increase it to
£120,000 by the creation of 90,000 new
shares, also of 13s. 4d. each. Forthwith, on
acceptance of the proposal by shareholders,
45,000 of the new lot will be offered at par,
one for two. The remaining 45,000 are to
be held for issue at the discretion of the
board. The co. has been vigorously pushing
ahead with the development of its No. 2
colliery at Wallerawang. It spent £35,240
on the work during the June half of last
year, making the total outlay to that date
£65,081. The board went to its bankers
for' the money and liabilities climbed to
£25,354 in excess of the more or less liquids
including stocks. The co., which
has been uniformly successful for many years
past, pays 15 p.c., and provided a market can
be won for the output of the new colliery
that rate may not be disturbed. The market’s
opinion is that the scrip is worth 295., equal
to 235. 9d. after exercising the rights. The
return at the latter figure is 8.4 p.c. as long
as the present rate of div. continues.

The total decline in Broken Hill share
values last year was £4,360,287; the stocks
were valued at £15,944,360 at the end of
1926. This amounts to a 27 per cent, shrink-
age. The chief sufferers were Norths,
£1,456,875; Souths, £1,235,000; Zinc Corp.,
£759,341; Sulphide Corp., £368,250; and
Junction North, £49,853. In 1926 there
was an increase in aggregate values of

The rain still misses Broken Hill. Last
year’s 383 points was the lowest aggregate
fall on record bar one, and the records started
in 1888. The best was 191.7’s 1677 ; but the
best succession of years was 1910-11-12 —■
1256, 1605 and 1518 points. The last 20
years have given much better falls than the
first 20; eight of the last score years have
had over 10in.. and only six of the earlier
score. And 1916 missed by only one point.

The industrial position at Broken Hill
will be in a state of flux until the new
agreement has been signed and sealed.
The only trouble threatening is that between
the Silverton Tram. Co. and its employees.
Alex. Campbell, since dead, was pushed to
the uttermost before the agreement which,
after a 12 months’ extension, expired on
December 31 was reached at a compulsory
conference under J. B. Holme. Campbell
could not accept the principle of paying the
men a bonus according to the price of lead,
but to prevent the threatened strike finally
agreed to pay a special allowance of 6s. a
week to bring the earnings of the co.’s
employees to somewhere about the same level
as those of mine-workers. The mine men
lost their lead bonus when the price dropped
below £3O months ago, but the S. T. Co.
paid the special allowance until December
31. The loss of that 6s. is a sore point
with the men, who, like the mine-workers,
think that things should remain as they
were, and there is talk of fight which
cannot be brushed aside as meaningless or
mere bluff; but the final “no” has not yet
been received from the directors and work
is going on as usual.

Since the end of 1851, when gold was first
found near Golden Square, the Bendigo gold-
field has produced 20.562,0880 z., or 629 tons,
of gold, worth about £83,000.000. Unques-
tionably there is much more lying down be-
low, for out of 500 miles of surveyed reefs
only 50 have been exploited. But higher
costs have made gold mining at Bendigo un-
payable and the field is all but closed down.
The yield for 1927 was only 12,8660 z. com-
pared with 16,7160 z. in 1926 and it is the
lowest yield on record. Four mines appeared
on the call list and no divs. were declared.
Hercules crushed 13.616 tons for 43420 z. and
New Red, White and Blue 6494 tons for
22060 z.
In 1866 on the Wood’s Point (Vic.) gold-
field there were 51 mines at work, all gold
producing. The Morning Star hill, originally
a group of private mines, was the best pro-
ducer of the lot. Up to February, 1867, the
Nos. 1 and 2 companies won 42,2890 z. after
seven private owners had scooped fortunes.
All this gold came from above 500 ft. Now
another scene in this strange, eventful history
has been acted —the New Morning Star has
closed down. Since 1915 gold to the value
of £210,000 was raised, and £27,000 paid to
shareholders, but diamond drilling has failed
to reveal any golden stone below 700 ft.

Catamaran Collieries, near Recherche Bay
(Tas.), has passed through a bad period.
At the end of 1926 the co. decided to increase
its output of coal by breaking through a
fault to get at good' coal known to exist.
The task took longer than was expected, be-
cause the fault was extensive. Then came
trouble with the Waterside Workers’ Federa-
tion about discharging the coal in Hobart
from river steamers, so the directors closed
the mine. They state that with the in-
dustrial position cleared up the mine is
capable of making good. Eighteen thousand
five hundred and eighty tons of coal were
raised during the broken year. The total
loss stands at £19,603.

The Federal Technical Committee considers
that, as a result of the State advancing
£78,000 at per cent, for the re-equipment
and development of the Sons of Gwalia, that
mine will have an output of two million
pounds’ worth of gold during the next 10
years. In these days of heavy mine insur-
ances, increasing wages and rising costs of
mine requisites, 10 years is a long way to
look ahead. Gwalia is a capably-managed
concern and will make better use of the. cash
advance than did one of the Ivalgoorlie insti-
tutions. It is fair to the Gwalia to say that
much.

W.A. Chief Secretary Drew, in his efforts
to push the Wiluna Railway Bill through
before Christmas, read a supplementary
report on the Wiluna by Alex. Montgomery,
W.A. State mining engineer, in which that
very experienced officer states: “At the time
of my visit ore averaging 365. per short ton
was giving tailing, after treatment, assaying
10s.; but later work showed considerable
improvement on this.” A gold extraction of
about 73 per cent, can hardly be called satis-
factory. Montgomery did not furnish any
figures relative to the reported subsequent
“considerable improvement.” Thirty-six shil-
lings less 10s. shows a recovery of 265. per
ton. As Kalgoorlie working costs are 30s.
and over, the margin between profit
and loss in connection with the proposed
Wiluna operations looks extremely slender.
The bill got through the Council by only one
vote, that of the Chairman.

Gold, but not much of it, has been found
on half a dozen leases on the Glenelg (W.A.)
goldfield, but prospectors and investors are
having a pretty rough spin there. At a
depth of about 120 feet the ground is too
hard for hand-drills, and water for ore treat-
ment has not yet been struck. Two or three
promising lodes have been exposed ; but until
water and treatment facilities are provided
there is little encouragement for prospectors
to go ahead. Although no Great Boulders
have been found the field is worth a better
trial than it can get under existing con-
ditions. State assistance to new fields offers
better chances of striking something worth
while than the popular policy of propping
up dying propositions.

For a Christmas cake the owners of the
Radio mine, Southern Cross, cleaned up
3020 z. from 65 tons, which was slightly
higher grade than the average of the mine.
Three years ago Adelaide took an option over
the show on a £40,000 cash-purchase basis,
but, after doing some developmental work,
abandoned the business on the ground that
the ore deposit was too narrow. All the
same, a good little mine is better than a big
dud, and had Adelaide paid over the £40,000
not much of it would have been lost.

Guinea Gold sets a notable example to its
Bulolo rivals in the matter of development,
and the December report, which deals with
the co.’s resumption of work on the Kor-
anga and Kaile leases after the testing
of the “southern leases,” is encouraging. A
clean-up of 1500 c.y. of wash on Koranga
Creek on December 27 returned 600 oz. gold,
including some quartz specimens averaging
70 p.c. In addition, some 5000 z., balance
on hand at the end of November, has been
shipped, value being £2 12s. 6d. per ounce.
Gold _ production is steadily proceeding and
levelling for a water-race on the Kulolo
Creek, which will enable the treatment of
additional ground, has been completed. Field-
superintendent E. B. Jensen reports the sat-
isfaction of the Warden with the manner in
which the property has been laid out and
improved, particularly in road- and bridge-
making and in the provision of extensive
gardens of native food and good accommo-

“Lamia” (Penang) : The dovecotes of
Malayan brokers are fluttered. An ingenious
swindle has enriched somebody by $500,000.
This is how it was done. Some months ago
the swindler opened an account in an Asiatic
bank in Selangor. He then instructed brokers
throughout the country to buy and sell
shares. He bought large lines of shares in
small denominations and sent the certificates
for registration. Next, he executed flawless
forgeries changing the face value of these
certificates from small to large denomina-
tions. So wonderful is the workmanship of
these forgeries that the most powerful micro-
scope shows no erasure; and the forged sig-
natures are perfect. He foisted these fakes
on the brokers, instructing them to sell at
low prices or at best. He made his last
move on December 3. Singapore scrip was
sent to Penang and Kuala Lumpur and
Penang scrip was sold in Singapore. All the
scrip was registered in the names of Ng Gim It
and B. Joseph. The trusting brokers accepted
the certificates and paid out. The fraud
was not discovered till Dec. 9, when
the certificates were sent in for registration.
By _ that time the swindler was well away.
It is alleged that the brokers will have to
stand the losses; but legal opinion is being
sought in the matter. Singapore brokers
have been badly stung, and only two firms
in Penang escaped. They were wise enough
to demand references. A curious phase is
the fact that “Ng Gim It” conducted his
business through a G.P.O. box number at
Klang, and no broker has yet gazed upon the
face of the man who swindled them. He is
certainly It —a prim/3 of swindlers. The
companies whose scrip has been forged are
Rahman Hydraulic, Talam, Kundong Rubber,
Ulu Yam, Eastern Smelting, Kuchai Tin,
Membau, Allenby Rubber, Teja, Wearne
Brothers—and there may be others. In
broking circles it is thought that the swindle
is the work of a gang, and that probably
Europeans are connected with it.
* * * *
Considerable interest has been taken in a
warning issued by Sydney Stock Exchange
that big swindles in tin and rubber stock
certificates had been discovered in Malaya.
Two of the concerns whose scrip is known
to have been manipulated are Ulu Yam and
Serendah. Ulu Yam is one of Austral
Malay’s subsidiaries and a noted producer
and payer of dividends —the 16th was
announced last week —and the stock is in
frequent inquiry. Serendah was floated by
Tanah Biji, itself an Alluvial Tin offshoot,
and is not yet producing.

Stocks of tin—that is, total visible supplies
—at the end of December amounted to 14,862
tons compared with 15,004 tons at the end of
1926; 16,709 tons at the end of 1925 ; and
23,374 tons in 1924; the corresponding Lon-
don prices being £265 in 1927, £298 in 1926.
£279 in 1925 and £269 in 1924. The total
consumption during the month of December
for the past four years was :
1924 7598 tons.
1925 9629 „
1926 9496 „
1927 9228 „
The total consumption during 1927 was
116,225 tons as against 113,932 tons in 1926
and 116,988 tons in 1925. The production
during 1927 was 116,083 tons, during 1926
112,227 tons and in 1925 110,323 tons, so
it is seen that during the past year 142 tons
more was used than produced.

The dredging returns for the Austral
Malay group for December fairly maintain
the high average of these properties. Asam
Kumbang turned over 72,000 yards for 34
tons, averaging I.oBlb. October’s average
was 1.151 b., November’s .971 b. Some 135
hours were lost for the holidays and repairs.
Kampong Kamunting jumped slightly on
the previous month, with 50 tons from
145,000 yards, the November recovery being
the same amount from 150,000. Average was
,771 b., two points better than November’s
recovery, but below the October figures of
.871 b.; say, .791 b. for the quarter. Here,
again, time was lost (67 hours) through the
holidays. Ulu Yam was steady with 22
tons from .91,000 yards, the average being
,541 b. as against .491 b. in October and .551 b.
in November, while the usual lost time for
holidays must be reckoned. Thabawleik,
with 52 tons from 100,000 yards, returned
the fine average of 1.161 b. per yard, though
this was a drop on the averages of the two
previous months, which were 1.531 b. and
1.331 b. respectively. Costs for the above
shows were: Kampong, 6.3 d.; Asam, 8.04 d.;
Ulu, 6.5 d.; Thabawleik, 7.08 d.
* * * *
The new year was marked by some import-
ant developments in the Malay-Siamese
stable. The institution of the pilot plant in
the Phin Soon open-cut seems to have been
•attended with some success, but the remodel-
ling of the plant has still some distance to go.
The December return shows a recovery of
33 tons from 35,000 yards, or an average of
over 2.261 b. Averages for the past three
months have been well over the 21b. mark,
and the figures for the quarter work out at a
trifle under 2.191 b. per c.y. Costs are not
disclosed, though these might have an inter-
esting bearing on the recovery. Nawng Pet,
the co.’s sluicing show, reports 15 tons from
31,000 yards for December, or 1.161 b. per
yard. The output is the largest of the
quarter, and the December average is bet-
ter than the previous month’s, though this
was consistently over a pound to the yard.
The quarter pans out at just under I.lllb.
to the yard ; here again there is no hint as
to working costs.
More interesting even is the news that the
co.’s new dredges at the Haad Yai and the
I-luey Yot shows have begun digging. The
Haad Yai values, which vary from lib. to
2.61 b. per yard on check boring, have been
the subject of considerable dispute by the
experts who did the testing. The only report
to hand says that the dredge has run for 52
hours and was working well at 20 feet, the
average depth of the property being given at
26.5 feet. Estimate of average depths also
varied greatly, so the dredge now at work
should be able to answer quite a lot of
questions by the end of the month’s run, if
not earlier. Huey Yot is digging, presum-
ably with the new bucket dredge, which
was to have been at work in April of last
year. The co. also owns a suction-cutter
dredge with which it first started, and this
is to be converted to a bucket. Average
values over three sections of this property
were estimated at about 1.331 b. per yard
throughout the property. Haad Yai’s capital
is £lBO,OOO in £1 shares f.p. Huey Yot’s is
£140.000 in £1 shares (it began life as a
“dollar” co.), of which 70,000 are ords.
and 70,000 12 p.c. prefs., all f.p. Pliin
Soon’s is £140,000 in f.-p. £1 shares.

“A.H.” (Suva) : For many years gold has
been known of in Fiji, but mostly so fine
that it is almost impossible to win it by
ordinary rough-and-ready methods. A local
syndicate has been working an area for nine
months past, but no public statement has
been made as to values won by the sluicing
plant, which is operated by a Vic, expert.
Gangs of Fijian and Indian labor do all the
bullocking under the supervision of white
gangers and work very well. The field is
near Waimanu River, only about half a day’s
motor-launch trip from Suva, but the track
from the river-bank to the claims is very
rough, and it takes about a day for a white
man to do that part of the journey.

It is Easy to Own a PACKARD
The Packard is not a ’‘high-
priced” car. Many thousands
of Packard owners all over the
world have discovered that it
is easier to own a Packard at
a medium price than it is to
purchase cheaper cars which
must be renewed every two
or three years. They have
found that the
Packard is not
an expensive
car to operate, and that
depreciation is less because
of the longer life of the car.
They have learned that the
various models of the Packard
Six are obtainable at consider-
ably less than £lOOO. The
model illustrated, for instance,
is a Packard Six five-pas-
senger Sedan,
and is priced
at only £855.
Be sure to see the special
display of Packard models
at the Motor Show on
Stand No. 33.

With the close of 1927, Mungo MacCallum
finished 41 years’ service with Sydney Uni-
versity. He was a Glasgow M.A. when in
1887 he was selec-
ted from among 46
applicants to put
the Faculty of Arts
on a proper basis.
There were then
only eight profes-
sorships and 253
students at the
Sydney Uni.; to-
day its 217 salaried
instructors include
34 professors and
15 assistant profes-
sors, and there are
nearly 3000
students. MacCal-
lum, as Professor,
Dean of Arts, Pro-
fessor Emer it u s
and Vice-Chancell-
or, has had a lot to
do with the pro-
gress.
JOHN GARLICK,
Chairman of the
N.S.W. Main Roads
Board, one of the
new Civic Com-
missioners of
Sydney.
Brigadier-Geueral Hore-Ruthven, who suc-
ceeds Major-General Tom Bridges as Gover-
nor of S.A., has many claims on Australian
sympathy. He spent two years on this con-
tinent as military secretary to G.-G. Dudley
and took a lot of interest in horse-racing; he
fought on Gallipoli, where he gained his
D. 5.0., and his decorations include the Vic-
toria Cross, which he won in Egypt in his
’twenties. Last year he was a member of a
joint committee of the Jockey Club and
National Hunt Club which investigated the
merits of the totalisator. Fortified by his
Australian experience Hore-Ruthven favored
the machine. Ruthven, by the way, is pro-
nounced “Riven.” He leaves the command
of the Welsh Guards, at Aldershot, to enter
into his new kingdom.
Sydney’s ex-Lord Mayor Mostyn had some
exciting moments just before and just after
he ceased to be a Lord. Almost his last
official act was to sool detectives on to a
reporter who got hold of an important Town
Hall document. The reporter came up later
to punch Mostyn, who had him thrown out.
There was more excitement at a meeting of
the Electrical Workers’ Union, of which the
ex-chief magistrate was organiser. The day
after he left the Town Hall Mostyn went to
the Trades Hall and resigned his organising
job. Two members of the union tried to
prevent him leaving the building. Mostyn,
according to his own account, threw them
both down the stairs. One ran away and
the other renewed the scrap on the ground
floor, getting knocked out for his pains. And
Mostyn’s only a little chap. Being out of
a job, he intends going into the indenting
and agency business, handling electrical
goods.
It is not likely that O. F, Nelson, the
plump, cherubic gentleman who has just
been banished from Samoa for five years
by General Richardson, is shedding many
tears over his fate. For the last two years
the business of 0. F. Nelson, Ltd., has been
in the market, and news of its sale came
close on the heels of the order banishing
the head of the firm. It is an old-established
concern with offices at Sydney and Auckland
and agencies in London and ’Frisco, and the
paid-up capital, £150,600, is held by the Nel-
son family. An English syndicate in which
the Lever soap crowd has a footing has
bought the show and the Nelson family will
at least get their capital back after having-
made piles of money. The firm was founded
by O. F. Nelson’s dad, a Swede who, as
other island traders have done, took a native
wife and found it helped trade enormously.
Frank Pry ke,. now at the Edie Creek gold-
field, New Guinea, is an old-timer who
cannot keep out of the game. A Goulburn
(N.S.W.) native, he served his apprentice-
ship' to the shovel and dish in Westralia.
Later, he joined his brother Dan in Papua,
and chased the elusive speck on the Yodda,
Gira and Aikora fields. With Klotz as a
partner, he found the Cloudy Bay field, and
with Crowe and his brother jim (since
killed in France) was granted the reward
claim for the discovery of the Lakekamu
field. Prospecting later at the head of the
Vailala River, he found no gold, but a native
presented him with a souvenir—an arrow
right through him. He left Papua then, but
returned with Rupert Clarke’s expedition to
the upper Fly River, to prove there was
no payable gold there, despite an earlier
discovery of colors. Engaged in business in
Svdney when gold was reported at Bulolo,
of course he had to go, one result being
“Pryke’s Creek.”
Dr. R. S. Ellery finds outlets for his
energy besides writing for the Red Page.
Pie was selected by the Vic. medical autho-
rities to carry out experiments for treat-
ing G. P. sufferers with injections of mal-
aria. Last year at Sunbury Hospital for
the Insane he treated 14 patients. Three
recovered, five improved and six died. G.P.
being one of the deadliest diseases known, it
is pretty safe to say that the six who died
would have done so anyhow, but to be on the
careful side the hospital has suspended the
investigations in case the strain being used
is “of too severe or virulent a type.” The
complaint is such a ghastly one, however,
that alleviation is worth much risk.
“X.N.0.”: Touching the boarding party
E. R. G. R. Evans sent on to a Fritz
destroyer (B. 5/l/’2B), Evans always did
like close quarters and stoush for settling
disputes. As a midget snotty in the Medi-
terranean he struck trouble with a cutter’s
crew of 14 and cox, ring-led by a hulking and
mutinous A.B. Getting tired of the friction
and not wishing to report it, Evans ran the
boat on a beach, landed and directed the
Bolsh to do likewise. The resultant scrap
between 6ft. of A.B. and 4ift. of snotty left
Evans a gory victor. There was no more
trouble in that boat.
Charles Bonney, whose inscribed gold
watch has been found after 70 years near
the S.A. lake that bears his name (B.
35/12/’27), was second in command of the
first expedition overlanding cattle from
N.S.W. to the then recently proclaimed pro-
vince of South Aus. The trip was done in
10 w-eeks. Later Bonney became Crown
Lands Commissioner in the new State. Inci-
dentally, explorer Eyre led the second cattle
overlanding team and took the first lot of
sheep across. Incidentally (2), notice that
S.A. was proclaimed a province. It was
never a colony.
Few men worked harder or with a more
level head for unionism than Jabez Dodd,
M.L.C., who died in Perth a few days
back, aged 60. Certainly no one did
more to keep industrial peace on the
Golden Mile than the man who secretaried
the A.M.U. during the years when the
big mines found work for a regular
army of employees. Dodd never spared him-
self, and by the time he exchanged his union
secretary’s job for a seat in the Leg. Council
his health was badly broken. He held office
in the Scaddan Labor Ministry, and was one
of those who left the party over the con-
scription issue in 1916. Such breakaways
usually got little mercy from their old
associates, but Jabez was a notable excep-
tion ; out of consideration for his past ser-
vices to the cause he was given a walk-
over when he submitted himself for re-elec-
tion. A native of South Australia, he arrived
on the W.A. goldfields in the early ’nineties.
Perhaps his only real holiday in a strenuous
life was a trip to England just before the
war.
FRANK WILMOT (“Furnley Maurice"),
Melbourne poet and playwright.
Imported V.C. William Angus, who is
tackling sugar-farming in N.Q., was pre-
sented with a cheque for £lOOO by Lord
Newlands after winning his ribbon. The
benefactor is an old man without an heir,
verra wealthy and a great sportsman and
athlete in his day.
John Peerless, of Fitzroy (Vic.) who re-
cently celebrated his ninetieth birthday, did
his first large-scale scrapping in the Crimea
and, later, had a hand in the Maori wars.
He was a mere boy when he served on
H.M.S. Hannibal in the Crimean trouble,
and was attached to the sloop Iris during
the Maoriland disturbance. He received his
first shilling from the Duke of Wellington.
Francis Redwood, Maoriland’s R.C. arch-
bishop, is the oldest bishop in Christendom,
though not the oldest bishop in point of age
—there are two older men wearing the mitre
in Europe. The sprightly ecclesiastic re-
cently celebrated the 53rd anniversary of his
appointment as bishop. Born in Stafford in
the pottery districts of the Old Dart, in
1839, Maoriland caught him at three years
young. Educated at Saint diamond, in
France, he joined up with the Marist Society,
and for a time after ordination taught phi-
losophy and theology to the scholastics of the
order in Ireland. Then a petition to Rome
came from Monsignor Viard, Bishop of Wel-
lington, to have young Redwood appointed
his coadjutor, but in the interval Viard died,
and Archbishop Manning, as he then was,
consecrated him outright. Now, at 88,
Francis Redwood proposes to take his place
in Sydney’s Eucharistic Congress pageant
as its oldest mitred participant.
“L.G.”: Many readers of “We of the
Never Never” and “The Little Black Prin-
cess” have wondered why Mrs. Gunn has
never published any other books. The little
lady had another well in hand when the war
broke out. Then she interested herself in the
welfare of the dependants of Diggers over-
seas. To these activities was added the
work of providing and forwarding through
her capable sister, Miss Taylor, a priceless
supply of comforts for about 90 soldiers
from the Dandenong Ranges, wliere material
for her third book had been gathered. And
then came the Armistice. But it brought no
rest from war-work for Mrs. Gunn, and so
far the little lady (her hair is getting grey
now) has not been able to take time off from
her honorary work for the wreckage of the
A.I.F. to complete the book. This volume by
the way, deals with the village settlements
devised in the -early ’nineties, after the
burst of the land boom.
“W.D.” : Mention of N.S.W. gubernatorial
secretary Budge (B. 5/l/’2B) recalls John
Storey’s desperate struggle to appoint 16
new members to the Leg. Council. McTiernan,
Bob Sproule and McKell waited on Governor
Davidson and were turned down. Storey—
at the time a dying man, hardly able to
articulate—then made a pathetic appeal,
but still his Ex. refused. Storey was then
inspired. “I’m told,” lie said, “that Budge
has been consulted, and he agrees.” Sir
Walter at once wrote his approval and the
thing was fixed. Actually, Budge knew
nothing of the transaction, but the man who
prompted Storey was alive to the value the
Gov. placed on any opinion expressed by his
official secretary.
Percy Pook, who will succeed Gilchrist as
Clerk of the Leg. Council in Vic., is a Master
of Laws, and will find his legal learning
useful. W. R. Bastow, Assistant Clerk of
the Assembly, will come over and take a
similar job on the Council side and be
Pook’s offsider, and there will be a promotion
of two on the Assembly side.
One of the acutest memories for the turf,
the ring and the stage went out with book-
maker William Maher in Melbourne the
other day. The only Melbourne Cup m*
could not remember seeing was the first. His
reminiscences of pugilism went back to the
gory, illegal and bare-knuckle bash between
Larry Foley and Abe Hicken on the banks
of the Murray in 1878.
“Coot”: The father of Maoriland Judge
Chapman (B. 29/12/’27), Henry Samuel
Chapman, invented the secret-ballot system,
now used throughout the world. It had its
test in the 1850 Victorian general election,
was adopted by South Australia in 1857,
New South Wales and the Speck in 1858,
Queensland in 1859, Westralia and Maori-
land in 1870. The Cold Country embraced
the system in 3872.
Enrolled in 1872 and just filed his last
brief at 76, E. H. Butler was the Speck’s
oldest practising lawyer. He was president
of the Tasmanian Cricket Association, and
occupied a chair on the Racing Club com-
mittee.
A. E. P. Milner, who called in at Mel-
bourne on a holiday trip the other day, is
an Australian who has worked himself into
a decent job in Peru. He left here before
the war as a wireless operator, went aloft
with the Royal Air Force, and, joining the
Handley-Page aviation firm, crossed to Peru
as a demonstrator. He now manages Pedro
Martinto, a big engineering firm in that part
of the world.
“Huffin-Guffin”: “Clerk’s” statement that
ex-guard Jim Morrow knew Batman and
saw his funeral (B. 29/12/’27) surprised
me. Even had Morrow viewed the funeral
he could have been only about a year or two
old—rather young for such sightseeing. But
when “Clerk” adds that James Morrow came
from Ireland in ’4B the error somewhere is
obvious. Batman died in 1839.
Now in his 94th year, Thomas Jackson,
of Wingham (N.S.W.), still repairs boots
in his little shop. The Jacksons were a
pioneering family.
About the time N.S.W. fish-expert Rough-
ley decided to go south on an inspecting
expedition (B. the North State’s
expert in the same line went West. W. B.
Hamilton, as chief
clerk and account-
ant of the Marine
Dept., secretary of
the Marine Board
and chief inspector
of fisheries, was
more or less on
speaking terms
with every fish be-
tween the Tweed
River and Thurs-
day Island, and he
knew -everything
knowable about
lighthouses as well.
In his younger
days he was yachts-
man, played Rugby,
was a Bisley rep.,
a passable leather
hunter and, latterly,
a golfer. He also
found time to be a
Masonic sec., a
church helper and
a Mayor. He was
born in Brisbane
and died there —63
at the end.
E. P. FLEMING,
Chief Commis-
sioner of the
City of Sydney.
Tom Gribble, now striding out solidly on
his 99th lap, still provides wood for the
home-fires of Ooonabarabran (N.S.W.). In
earlier days he hauled goods from Melbourne
to Bendigo for as much as £l6O per ton.
He met several bushrangers, including Gar-
diner, Hall and Mann, and managed to re-
main friends with them without being too
friendly.
THE IDEALIST.
[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
Like Horace, I despise the mob
t Who buzz and yammer when they see
Unveiled by some exalted nob
A marble mediocrity.
My own half-dollar goes, I think,
A posy on the tomb to lay
Of some obscure, unflattered gink
Who helped his wife on washing day.
(And yet I’d like to be the chap
To put Australia on the map.)
Beauty that flaunts Silkarto pride,
And plies the lip-stick and the puff.
Is tawdriness personified ;
And all too soon \ve call its bluff.
Give me the beauty of a mind
In harmony with bird and tree
And sunsets. Keep the other kind.
I’m sure Bill Wordsworth would agree.
(Yet all the same I wouldn’t choose a
Mate for a lifetime like Medusa.)
Great centres metropolitan
Are doped with cheap sophistication.
Give me a Man that is a Man,
The clean type of a virile nation.
A Man who swings his axe with glee,
His hawk-eyes scouring hill and plain:
W ho raises cows, or sheep, maybe,
Instead of merely raising Cain.
(Yet give me, within easy reach,
Rail, bowling-green, and flicks and beach.)
The sordid crew who scheme and strive
To pouch—or pinch—a greasy note.
They scarcely know they are alive,
Poor galley-slaves in Mammon’s boat.
They miss the wealth that you or I
Find, broadcast in a summer’s day;
The mind’s immortal treasury
Is triple-barred to such as th@y.
(All this is true. And yet, I wis,
A “Hop” cheque seldom comes amiss.)

hap with a load of three

15 miles waterless
with 3£ ton load
Mr. H. C. Tunbridge
(St. Peters, S.A.) reported
that on a 980-mile trip
from Adelaide to Wilcannia
and return, his Brockway
was forced to travel 15
miles without a drop of
water. The engine did
that without trouble. The
return journey —49o miles
■ —was covered in 36 hours
—an average of 13 3-5

sy BROCKWAY Fleets supplied to
’’ill private owners, trading com-
panies, ’bus and transport
companies ranging from 2 to 20
vehicles each.
Over 126 firms, individuals and pub-
lic corporations operating Brockways on
all kinds of city and country transport.
Record after record established on
everyday work in the city and in the
almost roadless back country—for speed,
power and utter reliability under all con-
ditions.
150,000 Miles—No Repairs.
Here is one owner has run a Brock-
way ’bus for 150,000 miles without any
technical repairs or replacements—aver-
aging 1 6 miles per gallon of petrol under
consistent 50 per cent, overloads.
Another, now the owner of a fleet
of four, whose first Brockway ’bus, still
in service, covered 200,000 miles in just
over two years at a total cost of less than
£2O for repairs and replacements.
Some of the unsolicited testimonials
forwarded by users are published along-
side. There is an authoritative, signed
statement to back up every claim made
for Brockways.
That’s the present position in South
Australia—after little more than two
years’ trading. In New South Wales, in
Victoria, all the other States and New
Zealand, Brockway sales are increasing
likewise. And the list of performances
unequalled by any other truck is being
added to continually.
“Proof of the Pudding ”
Significant, this, for all interested in
transport of passengers or freight. For
there’s no more convincing proof of
Brockway speed, economy, reliability,
power and durability than what actual
users give. No more satisfactory evidence of
their high opinion than the steady volume
of repeat orders and the mass of volun-
tary testimony available for inspection.
The Brockway is designed expressly
to give extra service. It embodies every
important improvement that has earned
unquestioned acceptance by British and
American engineers. Such things as

Timken Tapered Roller Bearings, Over-

The Brockway on Quarry Street hill, Sydney.
An Actual Incident
10 Tons of Wool Over the Blue Mountains in One Load!
62 bales of greasy wool, packed in five tiers—lB in each of tbe lower two, 15 in
the third, 9 in the next, 2 on the canopy over the driver—brought from Bathurst to
Sydney on Mr. W. Wright’s 5-ton Brockway. No heavier load of wool has crossed the
Blue Mountains by road.
The 128-mile trip was made in 19 hours and the Brockway, with its 100 per cent,
overload, easily negotiated such exceptionally steep ascents as at Cox’s River and the
old Mount Victoria Pass. The first 65 miles of the journey were mostly up hill.
600 Feet of Rope.
That length was needed to lash the wool securely. And 32 gallons of petrol were
consumed. The Brockway has been running on the Mountain route for over nine months
and is equipped with the special gear-box which gives a range of nine speeds. The
photo shows it after climbing Quarry Street, one of the stiffest hill-tests in Sydney, on
the final lap of its journey to the wool store. The total cost of repairs and replacements
for this lorry over 30,000 miles of service amounts to 15/6 only.—F.P.L.

“What dost ’ee think av down-’long town-way, ’Zekiel?”
“Nawthin’ ’t all, Tummas! Never seed a windlass all time I was down there.”
“Yufu” : Bullocks are better “homers than
horses (B. 15/12/’27). I once took three
teams from Goff’s Harbor to Eastern Dorngo
(N.S.W.), a distance of about 25 miles, and
left them in a supposedly sound paddock
for the night. In the morning there was not
a bullock to be seen; they had found a
broken panel and trekked back to Goff s,
arriving there about ten the same morning.
The paddocks they had left at Coil’s had
been the poorest of grazing, yet they had
vacated knee-high natural grasses to return
to them. They had not followed the main
roads along which they had been brought,
but had detoured through the ridges.

“The Rumpus”: My old mother-in-law
lived along the Harrietville (Vic.) road,
right against the giant-
peaked and densely-wooded
hills. Ovens River water
was too far to carry, so
her sons diverted the
overflow of a beautiful
spring high up at the
hack of the first hill,
trenching a passage in the
shape of a falling curve
until the water reached a
spot just behind and
above the dwelling. Here
a barrel was put down
with a strainer cover, and
half-way down its bulging
side an inch pipe was con-
nected. More piping was
screwed on and a tap
placed at -the back door.
To provide for the sur-
plus water the trench was
carried on above the gar-
den and then spread in
the shape of a fan. This
scheme worked well until
an inspector came along
and the family were
served with water rates.
And they would have had
to pay them had it not
been proved that the
spring did not gurgle the
entire year round.
“Bihai”: The chief mentioned as having
nine wives (B. l/12/’27) isn’t in it with
Ipai-i, of Ukiaravi. Visiting this Purari
Delta village, I was strolling round with the
old man, who proudly pointed out his new
house. “Ilow many wives have you got?” I
asked. After deep thought he confessed he
didn’t know, and suggested “we go see, count
'em.” I found the house divided into stalls,
a double row with a clear gangway down
the middle. The womenfolk were away,
some working in the gardens, some fishing,
others making sago or gathering fuel, but
although Ipai-i couldn’t reckon the number
of his wives he knew the name of the one
who was stabled in each compartment.
Thirty-three wives there were, and a vacant
stall for Mrs. Thirty-four when lie got her.
“E.S.S.”: Choom was employed in a coun-
try store, but had droving ambitions. Every
evening he went out along a bush road for
riding exercise, and practised droving when-
ever he could find a few cows without getting
lost. One evening he set off on a trip to
A CHRISTMAS VACATION.
“And how’s Herbert getting on with his violin now, Mrs. Finnis?”
“No good at all. The new pawnbroker up at the corner won’t let him go there to
practise.”
nowhere with a small mob of bush cattle,
in which there was a sulky-looking roan
bull. Half an hour afterwards Choom was
found up a tree, under which _ the roan bull
was cavorting with the drover's hat impaled
on one horn. The sullen beast had turned
unexpectedly, and the horse, in jumping
away, had dropped the pilot overboard.
Luckily the bull had stopped to gore the
hat, which had fallen on his face; and
when dogged took it with him. But Choom
wasn’t disheartened. “I can drove cows,”
he said, “but I’m not up to bulls yet.”

“Milltrack”: “I see some bloke in The
BuiXERTEENhas been askin’where the biggest
tree in Australia is,” said Charlie the Tassie,
“and some other bloke says it’s in Vic. They
ain’t ever been in Tassie or they wouldn't
arsk sich foolish questions. I remember
wunce over there I started to fall a palin’
tree. W’en I’d been at it about four hours
I hears a faint tap, tap, tap coming from
t’other side o’ the tree. It got on me nerves,
so I ’ops down off me springboards and
takes a walk round. After I’d been walkin’
about 10 minutes, the tappin’ gettin’ louder
all the time, I rounds a spur, and blow me
if there ain’t another bloke with a big
scarf in me tree! We ’as a bit of an argy-
ment about it, but as he’d been longer at it
than me I leaves it and ’as a go at one a
bit bigger. ’E’s tree was only a little one,
anyway, as trees go in Tassie, and not worth
fightin’ over.”

“Pigcat” : “Pythos” and “AdeL.” are both
right and wrong in reference to the wedge-
tailed eagle (B. 10/11/’27). No man can
say positively what a bird will or will not
do. The only general rule about birds is
that there is no general rule about them.
I’ve seen an eagle chase a plain turkey,
catch it with a mighty buffeting of wings
and churning of air, and drop with it to the
ground. And I’ve seen an eagle which
would not tackle a turkey in the air. On
the ground the eagle would swoop at the
turkey, evidently trying for that spinal-cord
grip with its talons, but when that turkey
took to the wing the eagle shepherded it,
nothing more. As regards robbing eagles’
nests, my experience corresponds with that
of “Pythos.” They’re merely disinterested
spectators from on high. I have never
heard of anyone suffering an eagle’s charge
while robbing its nest.
* * * *
“Gouger”: “Dog’s-eye” is an abo. whose
one optic blazes red when near firelight and
melts into liquid-green in the dark. Tim
greatly-feared possessor of the evil-eye re-
cently joined a canoeing party along the
Gulf. The voyagers experienced hard times.
Hostile nomads had taken temporary posses-
sion of all the “good lands” along the coast;
and on the barren stretches the canoe-men
could find neither sugar-bags nor bandicoots,
They captured one goanna, but its ribs
stuck out like the knobs on a pineapple.
Things were looking serious, and glowering
faces suggested thoughts uncomplimentary to
the sorcerer, when a whopping kingfish leapt
from the water and plonked into the canoe.
After a second’s astonished silence “Dog’s-
eye” planted his foot upon the flapping fish;
then he lifted un his face to the and
solemnly said “Tank you for the pish, God. ’
By thus publicly renouncing his old faith
“Dog's-eye” did the missionaries a good turn.

“Phil P.” : Settlement in the Speck soon
scuttled the local emu. In the ’forties of last
century it could be found in the nor’-eastern
districts, and existed in the nor’-west, until
the old V.D.L. Co.’s stockmen and other
hunters wiped it out. Emu Plains is all
that is left to tell of it in that locality. The
large islands south of the continent—Tas.,
King and Kangaroo—each had a distinct
species. As far as I know no remains are
found in Tas., whilst at King Island there
are numerous deposits of bones, and fossilised
egg shells have been picked up. Some skins
collected by French explorers and a single
specimen in the British Museum seem to be
the only authentic records preserved.

“James B.” : The proposed road from Syd-
ney to Canberra will touch some of the most
charming spots of inland Australia. It
will pass through the historic Windera-
deen estate, once the property of Terence
Aubrey Murray; it is now owned by the
Salvation Army. The road will skirt Lake
George for several miles; this portion will
be a very attractive bit of scenery, with
the water on one side and the hills rising
abruptly 3000 feet on the other. When the
ambitious scheme of the Australian Forest
League to plant an avenue of Australian
trees from Sydney to Canberra materialises
the road will be one of the show places of
the Commonwealth.
* * * *
“Tambo”: The N.Q. sea-pike referred to
by “Bootle Lascelles” (B. 17/11/’27) is
evidently the ogo of the Fijians, a fish they
like to keep at a respectful distance. It
fears neither other fish nor man. A F'ijian,
seeing a shoal of small fish yarded up in a
corner, set about obtaining his share of the
booty. There was a flash, and a swirl of
water, followed by a yell from the Ivai Viti.
He reached land minus the calf of one leg,
torn off by the ogo.

THE BABBKING BROOK.
[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
I am the man they call the babbler
Sometimes known as the babbling brook.
At fancy dishes I am no dabbler,
But the men get fat on the food I cook.
Big-shed shearers and Outback campers
Who live by gun or by line and hook,
They are the men who enjoy my dampers
And stand four square for the babbling
brook.
Bred in the bush I was never a townie;
’Twas in the Mulga that I was born —
And I’ll boil a duff or I’ll bake a brownie
As light as the breezes at early morn.
With pack-horse camps of the cattle drover,
Where mobs are big and the kit is small,
Or the motor-trucks that go quickly over,
I’m the babbling brook that can please
them all.
I can cook a meal while the shepherds make
fast
The hessian wings for the camp at night.
I give them curry and rice for breakfast
And cold fried chops for the midday bite.
I stay awake if a round is boiling,
For water-logged beef is tough and crook.
There’s never a chance of a dinner spoiling
At the open fire of the babbling brook.
I'm at my best on a big sheep-station
With plenty of water and wood at hand.
There, every day, there’s a variation
Of dishes with names that they understand.
Meat-pies cooked in a clean brick oven,
Pannikins hung in a handy place,
A snow-white apron, for I’m no sloven,
And the tin plates shine till you see your
face.
I’ve always a feed for the hungry swagmen
When the sheds cut out and the work is
slack;
And strolling players and stranded bagmen
Will get a meal if they’re on the track.
The poets sing of the Outback drover, »
And their tales of swagmen would fill a
book;
Romance is weaved, too, round the aimless
rover....
Is there never a line for the babbling
brookV

“Pigcat” : Lately I witnessed the birth of
the young of a spotted stingray. I noticed
the ’ray lying in the shallow water of a
sandy creek when the tide was in. She was
only a little thing, no more than about 12
inches across the flaps, and was lying
obliquely in the water, partly facing me. The
way she was stirring her wings made me
think her in pain, and I lay behind the root
of a mangrove and watched. The ’ray
became a little more agitated, and then a
long, whip-like appendage protruded from
her. It grew and grew, and the mother-to-be
became more agitated. Presently she
doubled herself convulsively in travail. The
wliip-thong had gone, but in its place was a
baby stingray—a thing no bigger than the
palm of one’s hand, complete even to the
spots on its wings—swimming beside her. I
moved, and must have frightened them. The
mother went one way like a flash ; and the
little fellow, but two minutes old, went tin-
other way—straight out to sea.
❖ ❖ ■]' ❖
“Hinemoa”: My memory is stirred by
“Light Horse” (B. 24/11/’27). When I
was a kid I had a particular dislike for
pumpkin, and never ate it if I could pos-
sibly avoid doing so. One day our mother
hit upon the idea of blindfolding me. I
was to be given a spoonful of potato and
a spoonful of pumpkin ; if I could tell which
was which I need not eat the hated vege-
table again. Unfortunately I couldn’t tell,
That started the ball rolling, and on wet
days we had tasting competitions, with sur-
prising results. Only one member of the
family proved infallible on solids, but he
went to the pack on liquids; he couldn’t
tell the difference between tea with either
sugar or milk in it, tea without either or
with both. It sounds easy, but try it.
“Wungoolba”: Concerning “Wandi’s” de-
scription of the method adopted by abos. in
tree-climbing (B. 17/11/’27), our Ifraser
Island (Q.) Binghis, when using a vine,
pass the free end round and behind the knee,
then between the first and second toes. I’ve
never seen an abo. tie the vine, and fail to
see how it could be done unless before leav-
ing the ground. A lawyer-vine with the
“skin” peeled off and put through fire in
order to toughen it and add to its supple-
ness is the usual instrument here. The
Atherton blacks seldom use a toehold until
they reach the first limb.
* * * *
“Matar”: There is only one native com-
munity in New Guinea which builds dwell-
ings of stone —it lives on the shores of
Geelvink Bay, in the Dutch territory, and
is probably the only surviving remnant of a
distinct race. The dwellings are made
generally by heaping large stones against the
face of a cliff. Entrance is by a small open-
ing at the bottom, and some of the structures
are rendered passably watertight by stopping
up the cracks and crevices with mud. These
natives do not limit themselves to stone
huts, however, but make ordinary thatch-
and leaf-dwellings as well.
“Tilburina T.”: Our yearly intimation
that a grasshopper plague is imminent has
arrived in Northern N. S. Wales in the shape
of large flocks of ibis. This benign-looking
black-and-white bird is invaluable as an
insect-eater. He usually precedes the ’hop-
pers by about a week and stays till there
isn’t one to be found in a day’s march.
“The Ringer” : Living in the home of the
tiger-snake, the Murray Valley, I have killed
thousands. I have run the rule over 20
since “Bayard’s” par. appeared (B.
l/12/’27) ; not one measured more than 3ft.,
and they included some veterans. Four feet
is an outsize in “tigers.” Anyone who says
lie’s killed larger ones will have to produce
the corpse to make me believe it.
HIS GUESS.
MISTRESS: “How is it that every time I come into the kitchen I find you asleep ?"
BOY: “I think might be, Sinibada, becos’ you wear’m rubber along boots."
“The Welkin”: The most successful
‘‘hummer” I know has a system which is
simplicity itself. He stands by a gate on
the Balranald-road and saves motorists the
trouble of opening it. From smokers he
gets tobacco; from non-smokers coin. If
there’s anything the out-back motorist dis-
likes more than opening gates it’s closing
them.
* * * *
“Toonooba” : Torres Strait Islanders have
developed extraordinarily keen powers of
observation, with the result that their know-
ledge of the teeming life of the coral reefs
is profound. Whilst collecting
on one of the western atolls, our
islander assistant gathered a fine
head of Pocillopora, a coral of
branching habit. As he brought
the specimen in for appraise-
ment a grin wreathed his lips.
Pointing to a gall-like swelling
on the specimen lie exclaimed,
“My word, close up lie stop, he
finish now. Reef-cod, he no
kqikai that one.” This was my
first view of the queer domicile
of Hapalocarcinus, a small crab,
which passes through a curious
life cycle. The immature female
takes up residence between two
growing buds of a coral, gener-
ally Pocillopora. By means of
currents of water directed from
her gill chambers, the growth of
adjacent buds is regulated.
These broaden out and unite
overhead, forming a snug cham-
ber, closed, save for a number
of minute perforations kept
open for the passage of food,
by _ tne crab’s respiratory
activity. At maturity the crab
is the size of a pea. Fertilisa-
tion by the smaller male takes
place before completion of the
“gall.” The numerous progeny
find their road to the outer
waters by way of the pore-like openings
through the chamber walls.
* * * *
“Wiremu” : Henare attaches a high value
to the large earthworms he calls “toke.” If
these are suspended over a saucer in front
of a fire they will drip an oil that has been
used for aches and bruises by Maoris for
hundreds of years. The worms are about a
foot long and are plentiful in virgin soil.
* * * *
“O. W. Wadham”: Ilori had been kicked
by a horse, so I called to see what the doctor
had advised. The patient was quite cheerful.
“Py korry,” he said, “t’at toctor te knowing
ferra. He ’vise te hot fermentations, so te
wahine just gone for te whisky.”
•! : * * *
“Momokeni”: The use of the cruiser
Adelaide in the Solomon Islands brings to
mind the last time a man-o’-war was requi-
sitioned for use in similar circumstances in
British New Guinea. This was in 188 b,
when (Captain Craig, two other white men
and five Malays of the schooner Emily were
murdered by the natives of Joannet Island,
in the Louisiade Archipelago, and the vessel
was seized and burnt. When news of this was
received, Captain Clayton was despatched to
the scene in 11.M.5. Diamond. Nothing much
was accomplished except the destruction of a
village or two by shell-fire, the natives hav-
ing “gone bush.” The impossibility _of
heavily-clothed and accoutred sailors being
able to capture the natives in such country
was demonstrated to the captain when, whilst
walking along the narrow beach, his rille
was snatched from his hands by a native
who vanished in the scrub like a wraith.
On a visit to Joannet Island many years
after, I was amazed to find in a canoe a
mucli-rusted unexploded Gin. shell being used
as an anchor. The owner of the canoe, a
grizzled veteran, gave me his version of the
cutting out of the Emily. “Man-o’-war he
come, make big fella bang, mother big bang;
plenty fire along village. House he fall down,
big fire burn em up. One thing, nobody hurt,
Nobody stop along village; we run along
bush. By-em-bye man-o’-war he go away we
all go back makem new house. My word,
this big fella bang he dig up ground good,
knockem down tree, save plenty work along
Joannet man ; we makem good garden along
yam and banana.” He seemed to regard it
as rather a futile demonstration, the loss
of a house being tempered, as far as he was
concerned, by the finding of the unexploded
shell, which had served him faithfully as an
anchor for over 35 years.
* * * *
“J.G.” : The spider whose web pulled off
“Nuc-s’s” hat (B. 15/12/’27) was probably
a big specimen of the Clubionidce family,
which includes the miscalled tarantula.
Australia has no true tarantulas. I have
met veritable giants on webs stretched
between two or more scrub-trees in the bush
north of Bendigo, and have had my hat
dipped by the webs. These have to be strong,
as some of the spiders weigh several ounces.

“Moe”: During a recent ascent of Mount
Edward, the highest peak in Papua, an ex-
ploration party encountered an animal which
had not been observed before. In body it
was shaped like a dingo, but its head was
distinctly feline and resembled that of the
domestic cat. Its fur was sleek and glossy,
with black and white spots, and its tail long
and bushy. The creature’s gait was swift
and not unlike that of the dingo. As all the
members of the party were well acquainted
with the natural fauna thereabout, it is not
at all likely that it was some known animal,
such as the giant cuscus.

“Rob P.”: If “Kayeff” (B. 8/12/’27)
tries goanna-oil in a coarse-grained bottle
he will find that the penetrating qualities
attributed to it are not illusory. My test was
made with a pickle-bottle half-full of the oil,
the cork being sealed with plaster of paris.
After thoroughly cleaning it outside, I put
the bottle, with a sheet of brown paper under
it, on a bench where the afternoon’s sun
reached it. In five weeks the paper showed
a two-inch circle of oil round the base of
the bottle.

“Sucre”: As to rabbits changing their
color (B. 8/12/’27). In 1866 a number of
bunnies were let loose on Magnetic Island,
Townsville. In 12 months they were snow-
white. Another six months and they had
vanished from the island.
STOCKIN.
[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
Tlie crops is cornin’ ripe again, the harvest
days is ’ere ;
An’ I suppose I’ll ’ave ter go an’ stook the
’ay this year.
It ’elps a man to earn ’is oats an’ get ’is
smoke an’ beer.
It's out at four o’clock, me lad, an’ git the
’orses fed.
The cocky ’as been up an hour, so tumble
outer bed
An’ douse yer dial in a pail an’ clear yer
sleepy ’ead.
The ’orses go with jinglin’ chains to where
the binder stands.
I throw me old coat on a stook an’ spits
upon me ’ands,
An’ starts before the binder starts, a-tyin’
broken bands.
The sun climbs up above the ’ill, the sweat
begins to pour,
The binder in a cloud o’ dust goes onward
with a roar;
An’ outward fly the bloomin’ sheaves
a-tumblin’ be the score.
There’s thistles in the blessed ’ay, there’s
flies an’ grit an’ dust;
Me ’ands is Weedin', torn an' scratched, but
still I know I must
Put up with all these blasted things—I’ve
gotter earn me crust.
Jist ’arf the bloomin’ mornin’s gorn—it
seems like ’arf a week—
The sun is strikin’ through me ’at an’ blister-
in’ me cheek,
An’ only think —the stock lies cool beside the
grassy creek.
But soon a welcome coo-ee comes—there's
bread an’ meat an’ tea.
I puts the billy to me lips an’ drains it
thirstily.
There isn’t near enough of it to slake the
thirst in me.
Then on again until I ’ear the call to
dinner sound
I bend an’ stook, an’ bend an’ stook, for ever
round an’ round,
An’ all the while the ’azes flow above the
parcliin’ ground.
An’ all the weary afternoon in blindin’,
glarin’ ’eat
I’m stookin’ while the stubble goes “scrunch,
scrunch” beneath me feet,
An’ when the evenin’ comes at last I stagger
in dead-beat.
THE BEACHCOMBER.
MAUDE: “Did Muriel get brown while she was surfing?”
MABELLE: “No, I fancy his name was Johnson.”
I tell yer that it isn’t fun—a day at ’arf a

But any job’s a port o’ rest when it is sink

THE MAN
ON THE LAND'S
PAGE
WILD-OATS SILAGE.
“Buro” : The worst pest in farm land is
black oats, but these can be turned into
splendid silage, particularly when mixed with
wheaten hay. Dirty land can be ploughed
and sown with wheat with the silage object
in view. As the crop grows it can be eaten
back by small stock. Such fodder is far
better for sheep than expensive medicinal
licks under ordinary conditions. When
allowed to grow it should be cut fairly
green (if the object is to clean the land),
for black oats seed and ripen earlier than
wheat. A pit is necessary for the silage.
An old gravel pit will serve. When rain
threatens the deposits of hay should be pro-
tected by a tarpaulin or other covering till
the stack is completed. The stack may be
several feet above the surface —say nine or
ten feet in total depth. When covered by
soil it will sink, making the silage firm for
cutting. Where black oats grow alone the
hay made from it should be placed in layers
alternating with Algerian oaten sheaves or
wlieaton hay. The first-named can wait
in a stack till the later-maturing stuff is
ready.
A WHEAT-YIELD RECORD?
“Lily-Beale” : J. J. Townsend, of Willow-
vale, Parkes (N.S.W.), has established what
is claimed as a State record by growing a
55-bushel wheat crop.
HORSE v. TRACTOR.
“P.M.”: There are two strong points in
favor of the tractor, particularly in a warm
climate. One is that a tractor works just
as well at 110 degrees in the shade as on a
cool day. Secondly, a tractor can be worked
dav and night. I know wheat cockies who
run a tractor 18 hours a day without stop-
ping except to fill up with kerosene. They
plough with two men in nine-hour shifts
and relieve each other for meals.
PIGS AND BRACKEN.
“Benroy”: “Bill R.” (B. 8/12/’27) and
his pigs on bracken in N.S.W. remind me
of our experience in Gippsland. It was
only here and there that our porkers would
touch the bracken until a Bananalaud visi-
tor gave us a tip that worked. Peanuts
were loosely turned in here and there in the
ferns and in due course germinated and grew
well, although they did not ripen. It was a
different tale when next the pigs were turned
in on this field; they went right through it
and cleaned it up thoroughly.
DESTROYING STUMPS.
“Fred Rich”: “P.P.W.’s” advice re re-
moving suckers from stumps (B. l/12/’27)
is good, but why have stumps at all? The
following methods of destroying them are
both easy and certain. Bore a hole with a
2in. auger into the stump from the top;
into this hole pour a mixture of equal parts
of nitric acid and sulphuric acid (about one
pint being needed for a new stump). As
soon as this is done the hole in the stump
must be closed with a well-fitting wood plug.
To do this properly the plug should be first
dipped in liquid paraffin. A stump so treated
will be rotten in 30 days, roots and all; and
it will be a loose mass and may be shovelled
and spread over the land as manure. A cer-
tain amount of care must be exercised in
mixing the acids, as one of these must be
added to the other slowly, otherwise the
operator’s hands may get burnt.
A less dangerous and almost equally
effective method is to bore a hole as near the
middle of the cut surface as you can get
from an inch to an inch and a half wide and
18 inches deep. Into this put 2oz. saltpetre
and then fill with water and plug tight. This
should be done at the end of summer and the
stump left until spring. Then take out the
plug and nearly fill the hole with kerosene.
Light this and the stump will slowly
smoulder away till nothing is left but ashes.
In most cases even the roots will be com-
pletely destroyed.
.THAT ALLEGED HOP SHORTAGE.
“Brady’s Lookout”: As a grower of hops
for the last 40 years, I was very much inter-
ested in the statement (B. 17/11/’27) that
Australia has failed to produce sufficient hops
for local requirements. The facts, unfortu-
nately for hop-growers, are quite otherwise.
It is estimated by a reliable authority that
there are 3200 bales of hops on hand at the
present time. This ought to make the hop-
growers happy, especially as they will be
picking the next crop in about three months’
time. According to Customs figures, Aus-
tralian brewers’ requirements are 9800 to
10,000 bales a year. The normal production
of hops in Australia is about 10,500 bales
(nearly nine-tenths of which come from Tas-
mania), so that without importation an
excess of brewers’ requirements is being pro-
duced in Australia.
Plenty of Australian hops have been sold
(when they have been sold at all) at Is. down
to 6d. per lb. —little more than the cost of
picking! Hop-growing nowadays is just
about as big a gamble as taking a ticket in
Tatt.’s; but one thing is abundantly plain,
and that is that nobody can hang on to the
game much longer.
The Australian hop-grower is up against
foreign hops all the time. Give the hop-
grower the same protection as is enjoyed by
Australian sugar-producers, and he would
make a do of it. Otherwise it would be
better to import the lot and get the agony
over.
A BUSH-FIRE BRIGADE.
“M.A.”: On the Walbundrie Soldiers’
Settlement we have organised to fight the
bush-fires that usually come along each sum-
mer. Our brigade equipment—six Furphy
water-carts fitted with force-pumps, wire-
cutters, etc. —is not beyond the means of
farmers, generally spehking, and is, when
backed up by thorough organisation, abso-
lutely effective in dealing with grass and
crop fires. A Furphy water-cart worked by
two or three men is more effective than 30
or 40 men equipped with fire-beaters only,
and the capital cost is only £6 or £7 a cart.
THE LAST GILL OF MILK.
“Roddy”: I would like to tell “St. Raw-
berry” (B. 15/12/’27) that I have milked
cows and seen them milked at all speeds.
Any cow can be milked in four minutes 'with-
out tearing the milk out of her mercilessly
and getting her back up. “St. Rawberry’s”
extra gill of milk is only what the cow
makes while being milked slowly, and you
could sit under her and get a gill every half-
hour all day. But it is best to milk quickly,
get all the cow has and leave what she hasn’t
made until next milking.
FALLACIOUS DAIRY TESTS.
“L’Fou”: Without in any way reflecting
upon the work of herd testing associa-
tions it is well for buyers of stock to realise
that there are tests and tests. It is a busi-
ness necessity for a dairyman to know what
each individual of his herd is doing, and no
cow can do justice to herself without good
feed and plenty of it. Poor feeding as much
as poor breeding is behind the poor showing
of herds under test.
But the man who is out to sell Ids' young
dairy stock to advantage will secure the
last extra few pounds by an extravagant
use of concentrates, and this often on a
scale only made possible by prospective
fancy prices for his stock. The additional
pounds of butter secured by forcing are not
what one might call hereditary pounds.
VACCINES FOR MAMMITIS.
“Digger”: A test of a commercial vac-
cine to combat mammitis has just concluded
at Colac (Vic.), and the results are not
at all favorable to the vaccine in question.
It did not prevent cows developing mammitis,
and there was no evidence that immunity
resulted from its use. In some cases it
lowered the severity of the attack. Pro-
fessor Wodruff, in his report of the experi-
ments, said the results indicated that infec-
tion continued to spread and the untreated
group compared more than favorably with
the vaccinated animals. The Professor, who
is director of Melbourne Uni. veterinary
school, warns dairy-farmers that very limited
benefits are likely to follow vaccines against
mammitis.
BEEF EXPORT PROBLEMS.
“FY7”: The growing British preference
for South American chilled meat, matured
and marketed early, has given rise to
counsels of despair from some of our local
meat experts. One of these recently urged
Australian meat shippers to abandon the
British market and concentrate on the Con-
tinent, where they are, allegedly, not so par-
ticular as to whether their meat has been
chilled or frozen, so long as it is cheap. The
quantities of chilled meat imported by
Britain, on the last available figures, were
five times as great as the imports of frozen
meat. All the chilled stuff worth taking into
account came from South America, and most
of the frozen from this country and Maori-
land. But the fact remains that, though the
chilled meat is in much greater demand,
there is a steady consumption of the frozen
article in many parts of England, and this is
maintained because frozen is cheaper than
chilled, more convenient to handle and can
be kept in good condition much longer.
BABY BEEF OR HEAVY HIDES?
“The Welkin”: The demand for baby beef
is reacting on the hide industry. The world
wants hides; not baby hides, but heavy
matured ones. America started the ball roll-
ing by slaughtering sucklings of from two to
two and a half years old. Now this country
is following the example, not to satisfy an
Australian demand but to create one. Unfor-
tunately for the hide industry, the U.S.A.
and the Argentine have already created a
demand in England and elsewhere. Aus-
tralia has not yet fallen fully into line;
but there is a growing tendency that way.
Cattle-raisers here have the choice of mar-
keting baby beef and producing hides lacking
in substance ; or of sticking to the produc-
tion of matured beef, so gaining a monopoly
of the world’s heavy-hide market. The
U.S.A. and Argentine will find it hard to
go back to the raising of well-matured cattle.
America may seek a remedy in an improve-
ment in artificial leather; but, as in the
case of synthetic wool, they’ll find it just
not quite the enual of the real thing.
COTTON PROSPECTS.
“C.V.”: Prospects of Bananaland cotton-
growers are getting brighter. The U.S.
Dept, of Agriculture reports the damage
done by the boll-weevil to U.S. cotton crops
equalled 7.04 p.c. of the season’s crop. Texas
lost as much as 11.09 p.c. by this pest, which
is entirely confined to America and costs £3
an acre to keep in check. The estimated
cotton yield for the season was 5,300,000
bales below that of the previous year. Prices
rose from cents per lb. of raw cotton on
August 4 to cents on October 8. Queens-
land and N.S.W. have shown that they can
grow high-quality cotton, and the Northern
State has 41,000 acres under crop this
season, which, if the season continues favor-
able, should yield 2001 b. of lint per acre
and be worth over £250,000. N.S.W., which
has great cotton-growing possibilities, is not
producing one pound of the commodity,
which is in demand by the world at the
ratio of 4 to 1 of wool. Agricultural-Minis-
ter Tliorby is giving consideration to the
matter of developing the industry, thus fol-
lowing the lead set by Governor King and
Rev. John D. Lang in the days of the bulloek-
dray.
OVER-PRODUCTION OF SUGAR.
“Carisbrook, Jun.” : The 1927 Queensland
sugar-cane season, which ends with the year,
is, with the exception of the 1925 crop, a
record, and a large quantity of refined sugar
will have to be exported to dispose of the
surplus over domestic requirements. The
production of cane for this season is esti-
mated to be 3,576,092 tons, which will yield
483,000 tons of raw sugar when crushed.
Industrial disputes, particularly at South
Johnstone and Port Douglas, held back pro-
duction from beating the 1925 crop; but
with the increased area put under cultiva-
tion every season, saturation point cannot be
far off. The Australian consumer pays an
extra penny per pound for his refined sugar,
which makes up the loss on the surplus
sugar exported overseas to compete
with sugar grown by cheap labor. But
unless the price of Australian-consumed sugar
is again raised or increased production is
stopped, there will be a glut of sugar in
the near future.
The danger is recognised by the Banana-
land Government, which has set up an
Economic Survey Board, with power to pro-
hibit the sowing of any uneconomic primary
commodity. Already the Cooktown district
has been prohibited (for the present, any-
how) as a sugar area, and, when the board
visits the district, proposals for the growing
of such alternatives as cotton, peanuts, citrus
fruits and tobacco will be made.
BUD SELECTION.
“Azac” : Bud selection in the propagation
of fruit trees —or any kind of trees for that
matter—is a subject not as well understood
as it ought to be by many orchardists in
this country. Most growers accept the tree as
the unit. As long as the tree bears good
fruit they consider it a fit subject to propa-
gate from. But the bud is the unit and not
the tree. This means that when selecting
buds for propagation the best branch on the
tree should be selected and not the whole
tree. The branch originally sprang from a
single bud, whereas the tree is composed of
a number of branches, each of which had
its origin in a different bud, and the branches
are likely to show, and do show, variation,
particularly in the case of citrus fruits. The
variation is often so great as to give rise
to a new r variety altogether.
Take buds from branches which are heavy
bearers of good-type fruit, even if those
branches are found on second-rate trees. Of
course, care has to be taken to see that any
exceptional bearing characteristics of either
a tree or of particular branches on a tree
are not due entierly to favorable environ-
ment. The tree that bears well under the
least favorable conditions is the best type to
propagate from.
Autumn is the best time to do the bud-
ding, the idea being to carry out the work
while the fruit is on the tree, so as to make
certain that the branch from which the buds
are taken is bearing fruit of the required
type. From such buds the grower can con-
fidently expect a profitable tree. There is
an exception to this advice concerning
autumn budding, and that is in the case of
Valencia and Joppa oranges, which generally
hold over well into the spring, and conse-
quently the budding of those two varieties
can be held over till that season.
TREE LUCERNE.
“J.G.”: More use could be made of the
so-called tree-lucerne, or tagosaste, as a
plant for hedges, shelter breaks, etc., especi-
ally in districts subject to occasional
droughts. The tree-lucerne, with its sweet-
smelling white flowers, is a big shrub or
small tree, and grows quickly and does well
in dry situations, though it; does equally as
well in cool districts. It makes a capital
hedge if kept closely clipped, much superior
to the useless and dangerous boxthorn. In
times of fodder scarcity it could be used
for stock food, as both cattle and horses are
fond of the shrub. Horses in particular are
greedy for it, and will eat every particle
of bark off the trunk and limbs if they
can get access to it. So if grown as a
hedge it would require to be protected from
stock. But in times of drought the trees
could be cut down and fed to stock and a
new hedge could be grown in a year or two.
Tagosaste grows quickly from seed sown
where the plants are to grow, but it is also
easily transplanted during the autumn, win-
ter and spring. An ounce of seed will pro-
duce hundreds of plants. The seed ger-
minates more quickly if steeped in hot water
a few hours before being sown. This plant
provides the quickest-grown hedge or break-
wind of any that I know. The young shoots,
if run through a chaff-cutter, make excellent
green food for poultry.
MARINE MANURES.
“The Welkin”: Market gardeners fortu-
nate enough to have a holding close to the
sea might have several varieties of good
manure for the taking. Seaweed ploughed
in is a wonderful stimulant. Crushed shell,
and especially powdered cuttlefish, wall form
good manurial soil. Sea water in itself is
a good earth tonic. Then there’s the shark,
which in most cases after being caught is
thrown back. He should be hacked into
pieces and ploughed into the ground. Fish
heads should be similarly treated.
BIRD DESTRUCTION.
“FY7”: The report of the Prickly-Pear
Commission, tabled recently in Q. Assembly,
refers to the progress of the native-bird de-
struction scheme which was adopted as part
of the Commission’s campaign in February,
1926. Since that date 57,392 emus, 51,033
crows, 8247 scrub-magpies and 52,573 emu-
eggs have been destroyed. All the birds men-
tioned are notorious pear-eaters, travel con-
siderable distances and scatter the seed broad-
cast. But it would be a pity if the emu
and the scrub-magpie were exterminated. The
crow has even better claims to protection.
It is nowadays generally admitted that he is
the most effective destroyer of blowfly larvae
known, and if the spread of the pear pest is
stayed by his destruction the increase of the
blowfly, as great a danger, perhaps, to the
pastoralist as the pear, is correspondingly
assured.
STRAWBERRY GROWING.
“Max”: I farmed a fine plot of strawber-
ries near Sydney for several seasons, and
found profits to be not half so large nor so
easily obtained as “XSA” (B. 24/11/’27)
believes. He presents only the credit side
of the undertaking, and ignores the debits.
No form of small-farming is so full of pit-
falls and disappointments as this one, and
a man wdio contemplates strawberry cul-
ture should work for a few months on a
strawberry-farm before investing capital
in this tricky trade. That £5OO p.a. can be
made off two acres, portion of which is
admitted to be under fallow and succession
crops, may be possible provided labor and
water are free, and containers, transport and
commission cost nothing. City water is
necessary and costly, not only because of the
(Continued on page 31.)

actual meter rate, but because of the method
of application by pipes and sprinklers, gear
which is anything but cheap. However well
watered the beds may be, burning hot winds
destroy the pollen and keep bees off the
flowers, the results being many poorly-fer-
tilised blooms and consequent malformed
fruit. Birds also take heavy toll.
“XSA” airily dismisses fertilisers in a
word or two, but they are a serious item of
expense, and include not only super., but
blood-and-bone, sulphate of potash, and as
much fresh cow- and liorse-manure as pos-
sible, for without all these good crops cannot
be expected. As for the mulch used to keep
the berries clean, straw may have to be
bought. Pine needles and bush litter bring
with them a host of insect pests, principally
those beetle-eggs which hatch into the white
curl-grubs that find a succulent living in the
strawberry roots and cause the gradual
death of many plants. Constant war has
to be waged against slaters, snails and
beetles.
One shilling per punnet is not always 3s.
per lb., the punnet being a very popu-
lar market size, for which Is. is very grudg-
ingly paid, and only for berries of super-
lative quality. My returns over a long
period show an average gross return of 10d.
for Ijlb. punnets. One factor which mili-
tates against decent prices is that at no sea-
son of the year is Sydney without straw-
berries, as they come in from Queensland
during the cool periods, and are always avail-
able in the shops from some source or
another. I never heard of jam-makers offer-
ing Is. Gd. per lb., Gd. being more than they
prefer to pay.
Punnets, transport and agent’s selling com-
mission are heavy items, and picking also
has to be paid for unless there is a family
of young people to do this disagreeable work.
It is excessively tiring, and the difficulty
of obtaining cheap labor at the critical times
of ripening may cause the loss of the whole
crop, as the fruit is extremely perishable.
The sweet-peas, w T hich “XSA” recom-
mended as a “side-line,” are one of the straw-
berry-grower’s necessities, vegetables and
flowers being grown in the off-seasons in
order to make sure of a living.
COUCH GRASS IN DRAINS.
“Prop”: “Yabbie” asks how it is the
couch grass grows in new drains without
the seed having been sown. When sinking
a bore, thousands of gallons of water are
carted to the site to be tipped into the hole
for the drill to work in. It is possible the
couch-grass seed and fish-spawn were brought
in this water. It is quite a common thing
for bulrushes to be flourishing in a six-
months-old bore drain, but bulrush seeds
have their private aeroplane and easily
manage long-distance flights in mass forma-
tion, whereas the couch and the fish are not
so well equipped.
A CROSSBRED FOR BANANALAND.
“W.P.D.”: Queensland farmers on the
Darling Downs, the coast lands and the high-
lands lying immediately behind, including
the Atherton and Evelyn, tablelands, are
waking up to the possibilities of profit-mak-
ing from crossbred wool and lambs for freez-
ing. The best cross for country where pure
merinos are out of the question and on which
the average annual rainfall does not exceed
30 inches is obtained by mating Corriedale
rams with good, roomy western merino ewes.
But it will not do to keep the ram lambs
from the progeny and use them for mating
with the ewes of the first cross. Every
time pure Corriedale rams must be used;
if not, the flock will be very uneven in
character and the wool will be so varied in
type that its value will be low.
The Corriedales and Corriedale crosses do
not walk the feed down like merinos; they
give a better wool return than other cross-
breds, their wool is more even, and they
are splendid mothers—even ewes with their
first lambs are wonderful. For very wet
country the Corriedale-Romney Marsh cross
will do well, but one would want to be
careful to get the right type of Romney.
APHIS AND A WOOL-CLIP.
“Trepex” : Many of the Barraba (N.S.W.)
wools this year are lacking in their custom-
ary stylo. They are poorly grown, mushy on
the backs, thin and straight. Owners lay the
blame on an invasion of aphis, which, they
say, has destroyed the nutritive properties
of a lot of their pasturage. This has left
the skin cells of the sheep without the matter
on which to do their customary job of grow-
ing a nice, fine, characterful fibre. It is in
investigating the causes of such deterioration
that the wool-growers’ Council of Pastoral
and Scientific Research has a chance to show
its value. Probably a remedy will be found,
but it will be a long time before the York-
shire scientists who lecture the Australian
wool-growers from a distance of 7000 miles
will do anything to help us in such matters.
GREASY HEELS.
“Villers-Brett.”: When stables are not
regularly cleaned and manure is allowed to
accumulate under horses’ feet, the ammonia
liberated by the filth acts as a skin-irritant,
and sets up conditions favorable for the
■entry of bacteria responsible for the con-
dition known as greasy heels. The forma-
tion of vesicles followed by pustules exuding
a greasy discharge at the back of the fet-
lock joint is characteristic of the disease.
Once the disease is noticed remedial mea-
sures should at once be taken. The diet
should consist mainly of green stuff, mashes,
etc., and the grain allowance curtailed. Bed-
ding should be renewed regularly; on no
account allow soiled bedding to accumulate
under the horse’s feet. Ointments contain-
ing grease should be avoided in the early
stages. Paint on the parts the following
mixture and allow it to dry in: One part
formalin, 5 parts methylated spirit, 10 parts
glycerine. Old horses are more liable to the
disease than young ones. . Draught horses
kept in stables for long periods are very sus-
ceptible. Neglecting to thoroughly dry the
long loose hair around the pastern joint after
washing is accountable for many outbreaks
of the disease. Horses with white pasterns
appear to be more liable than those with
darker hair.
Pastern itch, or mange (so called), paves
the way for grease if neglected. In serious
cases where there is excessive granulation
(gripes), skilled veterinary attention is
necessary, as an operation may be required.
As a preventive measure never wash the
heels with solutions of strong soaps. Be
sure they are thoroughly dried. Never allow
manure to accumulate under the horse’s
feet. To guard against contagion, do not
place another horse in a stall used by an
affected horse before thoroughly disinfecting
it.
THE DROUGHT-RESISTING COARSE-
WOOL.
“Pythos”: The western N.S.W. sheep-
breeder has to consider the small and uncertain
rainfall of the State. His first aim under these
conditions is to build up a flock of sheep that
can stand the long, dry spells and live on
any dry rubbish left uncovered by the driv-
ing sand. To do this, he has to sacrifice any
idea of superfine wool, and must select rams
in the first instance by frame and carriage,
conditionally on their fleeces being not alto-
gether too rough. He cannot aim at much
batter than an average 60’s quality. Another
point in the fine-coarse controversy is that a
season like the present materially alters the
quality of growing wool, and the fleece of a
fine-woolled aged sheep becomes short and
scanty. But the worst count against the
fine-woolled sheep is that it succumbs under
trying conditions long before its stronger
brother. Obviously it is better to have a
live sheep of any description than a dead
champion.
TO PREVENT “WARTS.”
“Bobette” : Prom January to June is the
season for “warts” or chicken-pox, and poul-
try men should take steps against the possi-
bility of an outbreak amongst their young
stock, the class usually affected. The dis-
ease in itself is not deadly, but its incidence
will probably throw the birds into a hnlf-
moult, thus destroying the chances of autumn
or winter laying.
The first sign of the disease is the appear-
ance of a number of yellowish blister-like
swellings on the comb and wattles. When
these break out near the eyes and beak the
bird is liable to scratch them until they
form spreading sores which totally blind it,
causing it to die of starvation.
When the swellings appear, the best
thing is the immediate application of the
laundry blue bag. Rub it on each blister.
The best means of prevention is a course
of Epsom salts and sulphur right through
the danger period. Give Epsom salts in
drinking water (loz. to a gallon) every
third day for about three weeks, then loz.
of flowers of sulphur to every 50 birds (give
less to birds under five months) in the
morning mash for the same period. Continue
thus alternately.
Give the remedies more frequently if an
outbreak has actually occurred, but don’t
give sulphur in wet weather. “Warts” is a
blood disease ; therefore, onions, tomatoes and
a plentiful supply of green stuff will be in-
valuable.
THE USES OF lODOFORM.
“Dingo”: Although iodoform is not as
powerful an antiseptic as it was formerly be-
lieved to be, it is by far the best agent
for keeping flies from wounds in summer-
time, especially in the bush, where one appli-
cation may have to last for days. Com-
bined with equal parts of boracic acid and
zinc oxide, in powder, it makes a splendid
dry dressing, especially suitable for harness
and saddle galls. One of the rubber blowers
sold with insect powder is a handy and cheap
duster. The resulting scab should be soft-
ened with a little salad-oil before the animal
is put to work again. A saturated solution
of iodoform in eucalyptus-oil of good qual-
ity cleans up dirty wounds. Healing is ex-
pedited if any unhealthy granulations are
touched up with a nitrate-of-silver pencil
daily.
HINTS FOR THE FARM.
“The Welkin” : A simple protection against
the ravages of caterpillars in wheat or oat
fields is to plough a furrow round the field
and form potholes at intervals. The pests
will assemble in these holes, when it is a
simple matter to bury them.
“E.W.” : Although green feed is essential
for poultry, it should be given in moderation
and regularly. When fed' to penned birds
it is advisable to give it at mid-day, when it
will not interfere with the usual meal-times.
Green feed is undoubtedly as necessary for
egg-production as grit, charcoal, green bone,
etc.; and if the farmer will make a strict
habit of raking from the pens at nightfall
all left-over matter the birds will be much
healthier.
“A. 8.”: Under intensive poultry-rearing
conditions the dust-box should not be over-
looked. Make the hole about two feet deep,
and place in it ashes and sand to which is
added a little sulphur or tobacco dust. The
“box” must be kept dry and covered in wet
weather and re-made at least every few
weeks. It is the surest way of keeping
poultry free from mites and lice.
“Nota Bene” : For a good harness grease,
take 1 quart of neatsfoot-oil, 4oz. of beef-
tallow and 3 tablespoonfuls of lampblack.
Add 4oz of beeswax in summer.
“Biro”: To make a success of rhubarb-
growing the soil must be rich with well-
rotted stable or cow manure. Trenching is
necessary, but the same result may be
obtained by first digging well over the sur-
face soil, then spreading a layer of manure
and top-dressing with a cartload of surface
soil from outside. When the plants are a
few inches high, boards should be placed at
each side to encourage length of stem;
higher boards to follow as required.
“Eureka”: Many inexperienced rabbit-
trappers use a dog to locate the traps. This
is not only unnecessary but does a lot of
harm. Rabbits have a keen sense of smell
and will not venture near ground that has
been lately traversed by a dog. It is a poor
trapper who cannot locate 100 traps even in
rough country, and a dog at an experienced
trapper’s camp is unknown.

n.s.w. The Bandit.
“Fresh” : Two spiders, who had not seen
one another for years, chanced to meet on a
lawn. One was so thin that he was more
a shadow than an insect. The other was
fat and prosperous looking, and his assured
manner indicated that all was well with the
world.
“Good gracious!” exclaimed the stout
spider, “whatever have you been doing to
get in such a deplorable state?”
“It’s this way, old chap,” the melancholy
ghost explained. “When I arrived in this
neighborhood 12 months ago I was charmed
with the locality, and sauntered around
congratulating myself on having found an
ideal spot for a home. I selected this large
house standing in its own grounds, and,
entering a bright room on the ground floor,
set about spinning my web alongside some
other beautiful webs I saw hanging there.
I had been at work for about half an hour
when a pretty girl came in, made a startled
exclamation, and, with a couple of vigorous
dabs, completely demolished my retreat. As
soon as she was out of sight I set to work
to reconstruct the web, but she was soon
back looking over the silken meshes and —
down I was swept again. And this building
and demolishing has gone on ever since.
I’ve just simply spun myself to a standstill.
But you—you look as though you hadn’t
a care in the world. Whatever are you
doing?”
“My poor friend,” replied the fat spider,

choices. For instance, you can’t pick your
father, but you can your father-in-law. Now
I —l wandered into the same house as you
did. But I didn’t go into the lady’s bou-

BANDY’S MATE.
The morning traffic to and from the mar-
kets rumbled dully by; the barmaid pored
over her sex novelette in the corner; I
sipped my beer slowly.
He stamped noisily in, coatless ; his shirt-
sleeves rolled in a business-like way over
his elbows, a long whip coiled over his
right shoulder, a liberal coating of grime
on his tout ensemble.
“Gisamug, Miss,” he said,
and turning and peering
through the door he bel-
lowed : “Whoa! you stinkin'
cows, whoa!”
He gulped liis beer and
slammed the mug on the
counter as if lie meant it.
“Gisanother,” he said, div-
ing a hand into a trouser-
pocket and taking a couple
of paces towards the door,
“Whoa, you blasted wowsers,
will yer!” he roared.
He grabbed his mug, sank
the contents and put it back
on the counter. “Might’s
well ’ave another while I got
time,” he said. .“My mate
Bandy bin in yet?”
“Bandy? Who’s Bandy?”
asked the barmaid with a
puzzled frown, as she placed
the beer on the counter.
His hand still fumbling in
his trouser-pocket, he lifted
the mug and drained it.
“You know Bandy,” he
said, replacing the mug. “He
walks like this,” and he went
in an exaggeratedly bow-
legged fashion towards and
through the doorway.
When suspicion sent the
barmaid to the street there
was no sign of either a team
or Bandy’s mate.

When the band played an old Scottish air,
Mac took out his purse like a king;
With a look of remorse and despair

And tossed it down into the ring.
And the bandmaster waved his wild hair,
And struck up the “Highland Fling.”

The Wisdom of Chee Fu.
[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
ALL was not well, and in his high-
pitched, monotonous voice Chin Lee
was recounting his woes.
There was not that in cabbages that there
had been in days gone by; and, in any case,
the English infidels had ceased to buy his
cabbages and were persecuting him. And
his horse was dead, and the frost had nipped
his early potatoes, and the landlord had sold
his marrow patch by the river, and his
tomatoes had failed. Things were very bad
indeed. Moreover, the wrath of the infidels
was aroused against him. A small matter
it was —a simple game of his fathers. Chee
Fu knew it well —surely a game of skill; but
these infidels had no skill. So the shiny-
liatted police had broken into his house and
seized all his guests and, what was worse,
his money. Yes, it was money he had won
from the guests, certainly, but the Man-
darin had demanded seven hundred tael
besides. Seven hundred tael! Nearly all the
money he possessed! Truly but for the
money in the tea-box under the manure-
heap outside the stable Chin Lee had nothing.
And his horse was dead, and his potatoes
killed by frost, and his tomatoes had
failed.... , . ,
Chee Fu listened gravely to the unkind
things Fate and the infidels had done to liis
brother; and he nodded wisely, saying little.
Chee Fu had the reputation of being a wise
man, and could not say much for fear of
being found out.
From the torrent of Chin Lee’s complaint
he extracted the essence of his desire to leave
the land of cabbages and infidels for that of
his forefathers. But he wished to leave it
with the money in the tea-box u nder the
manure-heap as complete as possible, and
boat fares were expensive.
“I will think,” promised Chee Fu cau-
tiously, sandwiching the
words hastily between the
end of the third recital of
Lee’s woes and the com-
mencement of the fourth. So
Chin Lee went home to ■ his
unsold cabbages while Chee
Fu prepared to think.
* * *
Undoubtedly Fate was on
the warpath against all
things Celestial. Had Cheong
Ku been of an analytical
turn of mind, this thought
might have occurred to him
when he saw the master of
the pearler Eva Wilton was
dead.
The tap on the head
Cheong Ku had given him
was meant only to make him
see reason. But apparently
hard-headed Casher Wilton
had a soft skull, for the face
that ten minutes ago had
been red and hot and angry
had a blue look now under
its tan, and the lips that had
cursed and threatened him
showed a thin trickle of
blood at the corners.
But Cheong Ku had not
an analytical mind, and he took this last and
greatest calamity much as he had taken the
unfortunate happenings of the past month.
Carefully he dragged the body of his late
partner to the hatchway, and heard a box
crack as it landed on the stores below. Then
carefully he gathered the pearls from the
hatch-cover, and poured them into the little
chamois bag that contained more pearls —
the pearls whose disappearance had caused
Wilton to make inquiries that would have
embarrassed anyone but a Celestial. Cheong
Ku returned the chamois bag to an inner
pocket of his dirty robe, and peering over
the edge of the hatchway saw comfortingly
that Wilton’s body looked as if he had fallen.
He kicked away some of the rotten beading
to strengthen the illusion. These infidels
had strange prejudices. He recalled the fuss
there had been when the Japanese Yamamoto
had been shot—accidentally—near Darwin.
He was a troublesome fellow, Yamamoto, and
he knew too much.
Drawing his robe closer round him, he
slipped into the boat that towed astern. It
was well, he thought, he was not known
ashore. He boarded Li Wong’s ketch in the
darkness, and made an arrangement, satis-
factory to himself at least, whereby he would
be landed at Fremantle.
It was not until Li’s boat was nearing that
port that Cheong Fu remembered the tiller
with which he had hit Wilton was still on
the deck of the Eva Wilton !
t- * * *
Chee Fu was still thinking of Chin Lee
and his woes when Cheong Ku arrived,
trembling and unnerved. “They do not know
me,” he told Chee Fu, “except by name.
They know Cheong Ku was the partner of
Wilton, but me they have never seen.” And
Chee Fu saw the pearls and thought he could
do something to help Cheong Ku. “All comes
to him who waits,” he told Oheong Ku. ‘Be
patient. You must become a market gar-
dener
And thinking of the tiller that would tell
the tale of the murder, and his quarrel with
Li, who had brought him from the pearling-
grounds, Cheong Ku handed over half the
pearls and agreed. . .
So in the morning Chee Fu visited the dis-
consolate Chin Lee and found him burying
his horse as far away from the marrow-
patch as possible.
“I have thought,” announced Chee Fu.
“Where is your money?”
Chin Lee dug up his money in the tea-box
under the manure-heap outside the stable
and accompanied Chee Fu.
“You must act thus and thus,” Chee Fu
told Chin Lee, and Chin Lee was content,
for was not Chee Fu a wise man?
So it was arranged that Cheong Ku gave
up his name, which was not his right name,
anyhow, and called himself Chin Lee, and
lived in Chin Lee’s little hut at the top
of the garden. He planted more potatoes and
tomatoes, and sold cabbages to the infidels,
but never spoke a word. And one. silent
Chinaman is so like another silent Chinaman
that nobody noticed at all.
But presently there reached the ears of
Inspector Seymour tales of a strange China-
man in the house of Chee Fu. And Inspec-
tor Seymour sent inquisitorial policemen to
investigate the tale—which was just what
Chee Fu intended he should do when be
spread the rumor.
“This is Cheong Ku,” he told them blandly.
“He speaks no English, but he is clever,
and will learn soon.”
“He cannot stay here,” decided the police-
men. “He must be deported.”
And they carried this Cheong Ku, who
was really Chin Lee, the market-gardener, off
to gaol, and asked him to spell “sexagesi-
A FRIEND IN NEED.
“Th’ missus has cleared off and left me.”
“Sorry, old man. Take mine.”
mal,” and “mesocephalous,” and “paraphras-
tical,” and to read a Dutch Bible. And when
he failed, they said he could not speak English.
So the Court made an order for Cheong
Ku’s deportation.
Which was just what Chee Fu intended it
should do when he renamed Chin Lee Cheong
Ku and told him to speak no English.
But while Chin Lee, who now was called
Cheong Ku (which didn’t matter in the
least, because his name was not really Chin
Lee either), was in the infidel’s prison wait-
ing for a ship to take him to the land of his
forefathers with the money in the box that
had been under the manure heap, a particu-
larly dangerous type of infidel arrived from
the pearling grounds.
Chee Fu heard of his coming, and visited
Chin. Lee in prison. “Give me the money
in the box to keep for you,” he said ; “these
infidels are not to be trusted.”
So Chin Lee, knowing Chee Fu was a wise
man, gave him the money.
And Chee Fu visited the real Cheong Ku
and found the name Chin Lee on his cart
in big letters. And when Chee Fu told him
the man from the p-earling-grounds had
arrived, Cheong Ku trembled to his mis-
shapen boots.
So Chee Fu took more pearls, and promised
to say nothing.
“This .Cheong Ku has done murder,” the
infidel from the pearling-grounds told the
stern-looking policemen. So they gave him
Cheong Ku, who was really Chin Keo,
to take back to the pearling-grounds.
At the pearling-grounds they proved quite
conclusively that Cheong Ku had murdered
Casher Wilton for the pearls. And they
proved quite conclusively that Chin -L«ee
was Cheong Ku, which was rather clever,
because really he wasn't even Chin Lee.
And when Chin Lee protested and told them
all his woes and called on Chee Fu to prove
he spoke truth, Chee Fu looked wise and
innocent, and went to see the real Cheong
Ku again. He came away with the rest or
the pearls. But he didn’t know that, and
thought there were more. So he said nothing.
So Chin Lee went to his forefathers direct,
rather quicker than he expected, without a
sight of the land that had borne him, and
without a need for the money that had been
in the box. And lie went labelled Cheong
Ku, murderer. ,
And Chee Fu smiled, and counted the
money in the box that had been Chin Lee s,
and the money he had got from- Cheong Ku s
pearls and the money he collected each
week from the new Chin Lee, market-gar-
dener, and dreamed dreams of China and
the wealth that was his.
And everyone looked on Chee h u as a
wise man ; and he did not say much for fear
of being found out.

The Tragedy of an Expectation.
[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
MILLIE and I went to an afternoon
cabaret. We go about a great deal
together ; but up to this time we had
never thought—at least I had never thought
—of going to a cabaret. Everybody says
Millie and I will marry some day—every-
body but Millie. At any rate, coming back
from Manly after a glorious, sun-burnt day,
I, remarked “We must go to a cabaret”—
just as you’d say “I must have a trip to
England some day” after someone has been
talking of the wonders of London.
Naturally, I didn’t think that Millie would
take it seriously. But she shrieked, “Oooh,
how lovel-ly !” And some people on the boat
turned to look at the sunset. I w'as bewil-
dered, for I thought she would just murmur
“M’mm,” dreamily, and leave it at that. I
knew it was too late to retract when she
said, quite as if the matter was settled, “I’ll
wear my new frock.” I couldn’t understand
Millie’s concurrence with the wild sugges-
tion. She had always protested against»our
indulging in expensive pleasures. Millie —
but Millie keeps her reflections to herself.
Well, I thought, as she had set her heart
on going to this cabaret, we would have to
go, and hang the expense. So we decided
to go to the Whitehall one afternoon. Millie
had heard of the wonderful floor, and more
in sorrow than in hanker I listened to the
glories of this temple of Mammon, and cal-
culated mentally how many years of smoking
I would have to forego in order to balance
my ledger.
Several weeks later Millie brought the
subject up again. After much simulated
enthusiasm on my part we agreed upon a
day. Resultant upon this, the news-
papers say, I rang up the Whitehall to
inquire what the tariff might be, and nearly
collapsed into the mouthpiece when a
woman’s voice said “Five shillings.”
“Oh, no,” I said hrmly when I had re-
covered, “I don’t mean the cloakroom
charges. I want to know how much it costs
altogether.”
“Five shillings,” she repeated, and seemed
annoyed.
I didn’t believe the woman, so before I
met Millie on the appointed afternoon I
went to the bank and drew out my savings
for the last 12 months. I asked the teller
to give me the money in five single notes,
in case I had to do some tipping. Then I
made for the Whitehall and Millie. There
she was, five minutes early, and radiant with
excitement. Her joy (which always has a
delightful spontaneity) infected me. I soon
forgot all my financial worries and became
expectantly joyful myself. On the way to
the ballroom my spirits rose from the effect
of the splendor all about. We had come
much too early, of course, and were told to
wait in a luxurious “salon” adjoining the
ballroom. Millie settled herself in a chair
which commanded a view of the stairs in
order to watch the arrival of the gay youth
and sparkling beauty of a great metropolis.
Minutes passed before a few stout, plain
women climbed puffingly into the room. They
had come, I presumed, to gaze on the youth-
ful rioting. More and more age arrived,
and each newcomer seemed stouter than the
last.
“Have we come to the wrong place?” I
asked Millie.
“Oh, do cheer up,” she replied, “it’s going
to be lovely.”
Then there emerged somewhere from the
bowels of earth a man in singlet and
trousers and not the slightest vestige of
embarrassment.
“Good heavens!” I muttered. “Does the
Seamen’s Union meet here?”
Millie remonstrated again. “You ass, he’s
come from the kitchen, I suppose.” And the
man, suiting his action to her words, dis-
appeared into the earth, whistling.
“But,” I protested, “where are the roy-
stering sons of Croesus, and where the laugh-
ing ladies?”
“Working, I suppose,” Millie replied, and
went on to praise the flowers and make
facetious comparisons with our suburban
palais, in order to revive my drooping spirits.
I felt more and more like a lounge lizard
as we joined the drift towards the tables.
Millie chatted brightly over the tea and
cakes. I ate something chokingly and felt
the last word in wretches that I couldn't
agree that we were having “a lovely party.”
Never before had I been depressed in her
company. And the stout ladies went on
eating, and the bald heads still shone murkily
in the artificial light.
Then the band began to play, and there
was a stirring of large forms.
“Millie, Millie,” I said hoarsely, “these
people aren’t really going to dance?”
My heavens, they were ! Two Gargantuan
figures, male and female, approached each
other. They extended their arms and some-
how found a grip. Then they panted round
the room, carrying on a long-distance con-
versation.
I watched it all, horrified to the marrow.
Distress then burst all bonds. “Millie,” I
groaned, “I can’t stand it. Come, come!”
M’llic was now furious. She hissed: “Sit
down, you fool. Are you mad?”
But I wms halfway up the stairs by then.
I dashed out into the street, where, all of a
sudden, there was an aw'ful noise, a blinding
light, and silence.
I regained consciousness in a hospital. A
nurse told me something about a tram and
an ambulance.
And all because I had put my trust in
Hollywood.

“Mor”: Much horror has been expressed
at the information from the Solomons that
recently a native captured by some cannibals
had been literally eaten alive, his captors
having first removed some choice cuts from
various non-vital spots before giving
him the coup dc grace. The proceeding is
not at all unusual. Some years ago the hospital
at Madang, in the Mandated Territory, had
a “boy” who had actually had the novel
experience of watching both his legs being
eaten by the guests at the banquet for which
he was supplying the delicaeies. He was
rescued by a Native Police party in time
to save his arms, and, with that tenacity for
life which in the New Guinea natiye is
equalled only by the looseness of his grip on
it in other directions, he recovered.

Information Sought.
Do the phases of the moon control or
influence the rainfall? If so, in what wav?
—2742.
The Commonwealth meteorologist advises
us that the moon may have some slight in-
fluence on some phases of weather, but the
influence is so slight that it is almost im-
possible to find it with certainty, and is so
small that it can play absolutely no part in
forecasting. There is no scientific reason
why it should have any connection with the
coming weather; further, exhaustive com-
parisons have been made, and the results
have always been that no discoverable re-
lation exists.
Returned soldier, with slight weakness of
heart (war injury), passed practical exami-
nation for lineman, P.M.O.’s Dept. (1) Is he
entitled to he made permanent? (2) Is a
casual lineman,, returned soldier, with six
months’ service, entitled to preference before
a non-returned man with a longer period
of service? —2315.
(1) A returned soldier who received in
juries in the war and has passed the pre-
scribed exam, for appointment as lineman in
the P.M.G.’s Dept, is eligible for appoint-
ment in his turn, up to the age of 51 years,
provided he is certified by the Commonwealth
Medical Officer as being physically capable
of efficiently discharging the duties. The
appointment would be subject to a probation-
ary period of six months, which term may
he increased to 12 months if deemed neces-
sary. (2) A returned soldier is entitled to
preference for temporary employment over a
non-soldier, irrespective of the period of ser-
vice of either, provided the former is com-
petent for the work to be performed.
A lease common in these parts of N.S.W.
reads: “The amount of compensation (if
any) payable by the lessor to the lessee under
the provisions of the Rural Tenants’ Im-
provements Act, 1916 shall be one shilling,
and no more.” Gan the lessee claim com-
pensation for improvements in the way of
fences or buildings erected by him and neces-
sary to carry on his business as a farmer, or
can he remove them at the expiration of his
lease? —2901.
The Rural Tenants’ Improvements Act,
N.S.W. (1916), provides for compensation
by the landlord to an outgoing tenant for
expenditure on, among other things, per-
manent fencing and buildings erected by the
tenant with the consent of the landlord in
writing. You have agreed that in respect
of improvements effected by you on the de-
mised premises the amount demanded by you
shall be Is. and no more. The Act stipulates
that a contract made by a tenant of a hold-
ing by virtue of which he is deprived of his
right to claim compensation in respect of
such matters as you refer to shall be void so
far as it deprives him of that right. The
questions to be considered are: (1) Have
you obtained the consent in writing of your
landlord to the improvements referred to?
and (2) is the provision in the lease as to
the limitation of your claim to compensation
a contravention of the stipulation referred
to? The first is a question of fact (you can
answer it yourself), and the second one of
law (and only the last Court can answer it
positively). As to removal of fixtures full
information will be found in Sec. 16
of the Act, a copy of which you can, and for
your guidance ought, to purchase from the
Government Printer, Sydney. The cost is
ls. post free.
If a person writes to an estate agent and
offers a certain sum for a property that is
for sale, and the offer is accepted by agent, is
that person compelled to buy? Can the
agent get damages against him? —2B94.
If an offer by the purchaser and an accept-
ance by the vendor have been made in writ-
ing the contract is complete, and on failure
of the purchaser to fulfil his undertaking the
vendor may in N. S. Wales apply to the
Court of Equity for specific performance of
the contract; or, alternatively, he may bring
an action for any damage he may have sus-
tained through the breach of it.
7 want to take up land in Papua for the
cultivation of copra or rubber, or to buy a
developed plantation. Would £5OO be enough
for either? Are any lands available and how
does one go about it? —2611.
Agricultural lands may be taken up in
Papua on very reasonable conditions. But
any person contemplating doing it should
proceed to Port Moresby and ascertain from
the Lands Office what areas are available,
location, access to ports, etc. £5OO would
be quite inadequate to enable a person to
take up land, clear it, plant it and bring it
to the productive stage. It would also be
far too little to buy a developed plantation.
lt. takes between six and seven years for
cocoanut-palms to bear or for rubber-trees to
be fit for tapping.
Is ancient armor too big and are ancient
swords too heavy for modem man to wear?
Are the weights known? —2912.
The suit worn by Count Otto, of Hennen-
berg, and Richard Beauchamps, Earl of
Warwick, both in the fifteenth century,' were
no doubt representative of the age. Weights
were: Elbow cops, 51b.; vambrace, 61b.; rere-
brace, 71b.; corselet and body plates, 101 b.;
hip-guards and flaps, 101 b.; thigh-plates and
greaves, 201 b.; helm, 41b. and gloves, 61b. ;
the total being 961 b. But the fully-dressed
knight seldom fought on foot (in fact, to do
so was forbidden at one period), so the
weight fell upon the horse. Joan of Are,
an 18-year-old girl, wore an ordinary suit
not specially made for her. When infantry
replaced cavalry, the suit-armor was suc-
ceeded by chain-mail, worn around the lower
part of the body as a skirt and with a
helmet resembling the “tin hat” worn in
Prance during the Great War. In Roman
times the sword was short and heavy, but
from the middle ages it became lighter,
and there was never a sword weighing more
than 15 or 20 pounds. Following are some
comparisons: Scottish claymore, 17th cen-
tury, 91b ; Roman legionary’s sword, Ist and
2nd century, a.d., 121 b.; Parliamentary
cavalryman’s sword, 17th century, 61b.;
German infantryman’s sword, 16th century,
61b.; French cavalry pattern (1889), 21b.,
35in.; German cavalry pattern (1889), 31b.,
32in.; British cavalry pattern, 21b., 35iu.;
British cavalry pattern (1908), 31b., 35in. :
British General Officer’s sword (modern
time), 33in., lib. 12oz.
(1) When did work begin on the Sydney
Harbor bridge, and (2) is a definite date
fixed for the opening? —2Bo3.
(1) November 1, i 924. (2) No.
(1) Are clean pastures liable to infection
by fluke-infected sheep? (2) Are there
any signs to indicate a fluke-infected sheep?
(3) Is the flesh of an infected sheep fit for
human consumption? —2BsB.
(1) Only on swampy land where the fluke-
snail already exists. No snails, no fluke. Sheep
rotten with fluke have often been shifted to
Central and Western holdings of N.S.W and
died there without affecting the country. (2)
Not many at first, but as the complaint de-
velops the sheep becomes very pale in the
skin, dropsical and “bottle-necked.” Safest
plan is to kill a few suspects and open the
liver along the bile ducts, where the flukes
are easily located. (3) Sheep fatten rapidly
m the early stages of fluke, and if the liver
is discarded the mutton is quite safe for
human use. Later, as they begin to lose
condition the meat is best left alone.
(1) About what would I have to pay
for unimproved land suitable for poultry-
farming or market-gardening within 35 miles
of Sydney? (2) Generally, does poultry-
farming or market-gardening pay near
Sydney? —2B27.
Price depends upon situation, quality im-
provements and other considerations. Within
3o miles of Sydney land suitable for both
purposes could be obtained from £5O to £lOO
per acre. In the vicinity of Richmond and
Penrith holdings are suitable for either
market-gardening or poultry, provided there
is a well-drained site o n the farm for the
poultry runs. If land is required only for
poultry-farming it can he obtained for less
than £5O per acre, as the quality of the soil
is not so important. Whether poultry-
farming and market-gardening will pay de-
pends principally on the man engaged in it.
Around Sydney many men are making both
pay well. In both cases the land must be
suitable.
To be a wireless engineer, at what age
should one start? Is it necessary to be an
engineer? Can a boy be trained in Bris-
bane? Is apprenticeship necessary? Any
other information of use? —2BB9.
Boys may be trained for wireless officers
from age of 17, and at 18 may sit for the
Government examination. The Marconi
School, 97 Clarence-street, Sydney, provides
a correspondence course (prospectus posted)
lasting over 12 months. At the end of this
period the student must undergo a further
period of two months’ training at the school
in Sydney, after which he should be in a
position to obtain Government certificate.
Cost of training at the school, £45 cash, £5O
terms. Technical knowledge prior to enter-
ing is unnecessary. Although there are occa-
sional vacancies ashore, it is usual for
student to obtain a position as wireless
officer on a steamer, where he will acquire
practical knowledge which may enable him
to find a job ashore.
Information regarding loall-board made
from sugar-cane refuse, where obtainable, in
what dimensions made, price, and whether
cold-water paint can be used on it? —2937.
The only board we can trace is Celotex,
made from the long, tough fibres of the cane.
It is made in U.S.A. and the Australian

Is any Australian firm now canning
rabbits, and where may the canned goods be
got in Sydney? —2B69.
Sydney Meat Preserving Co. tells us that
rabbit-canning proved uneconomical and that
no local works are now engaged in the busi-
ness. Except for a few small Government
orders, it is eight years since this firm
ceased canning bunny. The bulk of the
product was for overseas consumption.

Unpublished dramatic compositions can be
copyrighted at the Copyright Office, Library
of Congress, Washington, U.S.A., by lodg-
ing one complete MSS. or typewritten copy
of work, together with application form
(Dl), with the statutory fee of $l. If the
work is later published for sale a second
deposit of printed copies for registration and
the payment of a second fee must be made
on publication. Dramatic compositions re-
produced for sale as books must be pub-
lished in U.S.A., and two copies of the best
edition of the work lodged with application
form (D 2) and a fee of $l. In England and
Australia plays may be subject to two
entirely distinct rights. As writings they
come within the general literary copyright,
and separate from this right is the per-
forming, or stage right. This right is gen-
erally assigned by the author to the theatri-
cal company that produces the play on
one of three conditions: outright sale,
profit-sharing or royalty. It 'is wiser to
retain the. performing right and grant
instead a license to perform, which can be
limited. A manager holding the performing
rights or license to perform cannot print

2592.—T0 rid a w.b. house of silverfish.
If you can afford to have the house papered,
so much the better; the scrim and paper
should be attached by the usual paste, but
with the addition ,of arsenate of lead mixed
with it in the proportion of, say, 31b. to a
bucketful. Directions for mixing will be
printed on the container. Whether you
paper or not you must have a Spring clean-
ing. Move all the furniture out of the
rooms, and while it is awaiting attention,
take up the lino and spray the underside
with arsenate of lead, using about lib. to
15-gal.-water; let it dry, and before replac-
ing, sprinkle flaked naphthalin liberally over
the floor. Don’t use the powdered stuff.
Now overhaul the furniture and spray the
inside of it with a mixture of 2oz. naphthalin
to a quart of turps; use a fine spray and
make a thorough job of it. There is plenty
of room for flaked naphthalin inside a piano
too. Now treat a lot of sheets of newspaper
with arsenate of lead by using the spray.
Do both sides and let them dry; get into the
roof and spread these all over the ceilings
And when you go to bed pin as many as
you can on the walls with drawing pins.
Keep at it and you will soon get good
results. Turn a deaf ear to anyone that
suggests carbon bisulphide ; it is very danger-
ous when used in confined spaces. Arsenate
of lead is poisonous; keep the container
away from children. Be careful that the
turps-naphtha solution does not get into the
eyes; use it preferably in the open air, or
keep the room well ventilated, and let the
fumes disperse before using a naked light.—
“RXB.” [Submitted to the Director-General
of Public Health, N.S.W., his secretary com-
mented on this: “Although the methods de-
scribed might be efficacious in ridding pre-
mises of silverfish when used under skilled
supervision and with adequate precautions,
it is considered dangerous to use arsenate
of lead in the loose manner described.”]
2723. —For a red concrete path mix sand
and cement 3 to 1. To a kerosene-tin of
the mixture add a half-pound tobacco-tin of
red ochre. Mix thoroughly while dry. Then
stir with water to the right consistency, and
spread path in 6ft. lengths, using thin sheets
of cardboard to divids the lengths.—“Rotom.”
2576. —To preserve French beans, prepare
them as if for cooking. Put them in a
screw-top bottle to about one-third of its
capacity. Then put a layer of salt. Then
put in another third and another layer of
salt, then fill right up, and another layer
of salt. In a day or so the beans will sink,
and the bottle can again be filled up. The
bottle should be airtight.-—P.P.W.
2411. —A trapper is a tradesman when
he can “pair” his traps regularly; that is,
when he can catch two rabbits a night for
every trap he sets. I have yet to find the
man who can handle 100 traps and “pair”
them for any length of time, say 15 or 20
consecutive nights. Eighty are a big fleet;
for those not in the expert class 60 take
handling; a beginner will find four dozen all
lie can manage. Of course, setting traps is
one thing; working them to advantage is
quite another. —“Toby C.”

T.W.C.: (1) Motor mechanics can obtain
technical training in Sydney at Technical College,
Ultimo, or any of many private motor schools that
advertise. (2) Yes, if you have the necessary ex-
perience and ability. (3) By the approved methods,

advertised in S. M. Herald. But try for yourself.
Chancery Court, London, issues a list of all funds
over £5O in the hands of the Court awaiting claim-
ants. The list costs ss. and is obtainable from
H.M. Stationery Office, Kingsway, London, W.C.2.
Also anyone believing he has an interest in any
specified estate or fund under the control of the
Chancery Court can apply to the Asst. Paymaster
General, Supreme Court Pay Office, London. Lists of
“Next of Kin,” heirs to unclaimed moneys, issued
by private persons, are very often misleading....
M.S.N.: It is possible to get an injurious shock
while working a transmitting wireless plant;
but accidents are few and rarely serious—and then
only in the case of high-power transmitters....

towns is Census Bulletin (1921) No. 11, “Popula-

Rights Association, 250 Pitt-street, Sydney; and
Secretary, Local Government Association, 42 Bridge-
street, Sydney, might also help... .P.G.: Although
you have supplied more data, you still omit the date
of the work; but, according to Sydney experts who

original literary work, and a registration fee of
ss. with the Commonwealth Copyright Office, Bris-
bane.... Nora P.: All depends on the precise terms
of the alleged “arrangement or agreement.” If an agree-
ment was come to it would probably have been
reduced to writing. If it wasn’t, the position seems
hopeless. The Railway solicitor might be interested.

PERFECT IN EVERY PAR
f
COMPOSITION
CONTAINERS
The material used for Exide - Monobloc
Containers is the result of the most careful
selection and trial over many years. It
is superior to the ordinary compositions
used for battery containers in that it is
mechanically stronger, will stand higher
temperatures, is electrically a better insulator,
and chemically inert. The finish is every-
thing that can be desired for running-board
mounting, and enables the expense of an
outer polished wood box to be dispensed
with. Exide Monobloc Batteries entirely
eliminate all troubles due to the use of wood
trays, and are particularly recommended for
use in tropical climates.

slump would have been as big, if not bigger,
had Epping been licensed as a two-up joint
instead of as a tin-liare joint, but the
Bavin Government should see there is no
repetition of the incident. Clubs like the
A.J.C. which build beautiful racecourses
and put all their profits back into the sport
are entitled to be protected against the
cheap and nasty competition of tin-hare
meetings run for profit. If the Government
hasn’t pluck enough to prohibit betting on
the tin-hare business, as has been done m
every other State, it should at ieast re-
strict the issue of licenses to non-profit-

S W. Biggins, the former Sydney trainer,
has had an uncommonly good spin m Mel-
bourne, and he dominated the proceedings
at Sandown Park on Saturday; horses,
trained by him were successful in three ot
the six events. Biggins started his lucky
dav in the Sandown Plate, for which Trans-
lator, despite his lOst. 71b., went out an
even-money favorite; the greatly-improved
Linacre gelding won brilliantly from Ivlang
(15 to 1) and Arclielaus (8 to 1). The next
Biggins triumph was gained m the 1 ark
Handicap through the agency of Diamond
Plume (8 to 1). Durability, a winner at
Flemington on New Year’s Day, was favorite
but was never sighted; Diamond Plume just
got up in the last stride to beat Bonnie Lob
(15 to 1), Savadeen (4 to 1) being half a
Under the Whip
Black Duchess, who is fancied for the
A.J.C.’s richly-endowed Adrian Knox Stakes,
did a highly satisfactory trial in the Three-
year-old Handicap at Warwick Farm on
Saturday. The bonny Magpie filly was fav-
orite at 7 to 4, being backed to that price
from 5 to 2, but at the turn Valley (3 to 1)
was so far ahead that the race seemed as
good as over. However, the chestnut was
bothered by the last furlong of the mile, and
Black Duchess, putting in a wonderful run
from the Leger stand, beat her by three-
quarters of a length, Tressilian (6 to 1)
being third. The scratching of Sans Culotte
will lighten Black Duchess’s task in the
Adrian Knox Stakes, and if the going suits
her—she has run some poor races on sodden
tracks —Magpie’s daughter should win.
Bravado ran prominently in the Villiers
Stakes, and his withdrawal from subsequent
races at Randwick in which he seemed _to
have excellent chances puzzled the punting
brotherhood. However, he was produced in
the Sefton Handicap at the Farm, and,
with Pike in the saddle —like other horses,
he does better for Pike than for any other
jockey—he made every post a winner. The
Pommern gelding had only Bacagi (7 to 4)
and three third-raters to beat, so 5 to 4 was
a good price. Zuleika also made a reappear-
ance in the January Handicap, for which she
was second favorite at 3 to 1, as did Lady
Buckinbar (7 to 1). First and second in
the Villiers Stakes, these fast mares were
first and third in the January Handicap,
Resource (5 to 2) separating them. Zuleika
ran out the 10 furlongs very well, and it is
rather surprising that she wasn’t nominated
for the Anniversary Handicap. Maybe Dick
Wootton has the King’s Cup in mind.
Newcastle reports as to Royal Tune being
a sprinter above the average were confirmed
by the Greenstead horse’s showing in the
Berala Handicap, for which he went out at
6 to 1 along with Boss Poppy and Boo-
nala; Roseeka, who had every chance but
failed to come on, was favorite at 5 to 2.
But Royal Tune would have been second had
King Val (14 to 1) moved away with the
rest. Taverna’s big horse was left lengths :
nevertheless, he got within three-quarters of
a length of Royal Tune, and finished wide
out at that.

Saturday from one of the tin-hare com-
panies, and there was a slump in the
Warwick Farm attendance. No doubt the
THE LOOPHOLE.
[For, The Bulletin.]
“To circumvent the law that forbids betting where
the quarry is mechanically controlled, a jockey
mounted on a racing pony will supply the motive
power for a tin hare to be chased by greyhounds
in Melbourne.”
They made a cruel law, the spoilsport crew,
The wowser heads that run the blanky
State,
Forbidding books to bellow 5 to 2
Or similar remarks ejaculate
When eager hounds are straining in the
straight,
Hot on the trail of a synthetic hare
Which automatically pulls its freight—
But what about a pony-drawn affairV
It made us Ikeys feel a trifle blue
To think activities legitimate
Should thus be cramped by the officious few;
Abruptly plunged in tribulation great
We sensed a shortage on our heaped-up
plate,
Our well-tilled larder, too, we featured bare
If self-wound hares were ruled illegal bait —
But what about a pony-drawn affair?
When war is waged each lethal weapon new
Inventive patriots serves to stimulate
“Anti” appliances to hurry through;
And howsoever rulers legislate
Lawyers will pounce on holes, as sure as
Fate,
Through which to drive a coach, with feet
to spare.
Mechanic hares are barred for bets —but
wait!
This quarry is a pony-drawn affair.

On with the bag! There’ll be a thumping-
gate. -
Though law ordains the dogs unbacked
must tear
After a wound-up prey inanimate,
We’re betting on a pony-drawn affair.

neck further back. Scanlon rode both Trans-
lator and Diamond Plume.
Biggins completed the hat trick with the
ancient Pixie Lad (8 to 1). Like Diamond
Plume, Pixie Lad failed to earn his oats in
Sydney, but the change has evidently agreed
with both. The success of Unique (12 to
1) in the youngsters’ race and Firebreak
(20 to 1) in the Trial AVelter was distaste-
ful to punters, hut profitable to young D.
Lewis, who rode them.

The gigantic Royal Feast dropped dead
while exercising at Williamstown last week.
He was the most brilliant two-year old of
his year—a good deal better than Tri-
valve. But like his brother, Mercian King,
he failed to train on, and after winning
£13,019 with him his owner, W. E. Craig,
was compelled to pull him out of training
when he had just turned three years. Among
the races he won were the Maribyrnong
Plate, the V.R.C. Sires’ Produce Stakes, the
Ascot Vale Stakes and the A.J.C. Sires’
Produce Stakes. The Randwick race was his
last success.

“Ula”: It is nothing uncommon for the
winner of a “classic” to drift into the hurd-
ling game (B. 15/12/’27). Wycherley, who
won the S.A.J.G. Derby in 1924, was put to
hurdling by a master hand in Ron Cameron —
and went from failure to failure. Sandring-
ham won the V.R.C. St. Leger in the yeai
when Wycherley distinguished himself. Alter
repeated disappointments on the fiat he was
tried over the hurdles. He has still to win a
hurdle.

when he got five winning credits. His best
year to date is 1924-25, when 28 of Ins oft-

cap horse that doesn’t mind a sea voyage is
recommended to get in touch with Jim
Coffroth, who runs the racecourse at
Tiajuna, just over the Mexican border from
California. Racing being prohibited in
most of the American States, and booze in
all of them, the Mexican resort, which has
no qualms on either subject is a big attrac-
tion to U.S. citizens. For the Coffroth
Handicap, to be run in March, added money
will be £17,000, while an extra £lOOO each
will be presented to the trainer and rider
of the winner. Last year the event was
won by an imported English nag, so there
should be a chance next year for something
from this side. Incidentally, the added
money makes the Melbourne Cup, hitherto
claimed as the richest race in the world,
sink into comparative insignificance.
* * * *
“W.F.A.”: An original method of judging
races is in use on Belgian courses. Three
cameras are placed at a fixed height and dis-
tance on each side of the course, in a line
with the winning-post. An invisible silk
thread is stretched across the course at right-
angles with the winning-post; this, immedi-
ately it is breasted, electrically operates all
the cameras simultaneously. The twin sets
of cameras on each side prevent the hiding of
one horse by another, and negatives are
ready for inspection before the horses are
back to weigh in. The apparatus can be
used by itself or in conjunction with a judge,
who can then check his own opinion by the
photographic record before hoisting the num-
bers. A few seconds’ delay before these go up
might cause complaint before unaccustomed
punters get used to it, but that often happens
with the human judge, and even then he has
been known to blunder.
* * * *
“Ike Mcßagg” : What with one thing and
another, bookmaking is a worrying pursuit.
Take the case of a brother in the graft who
sued a punter in Melbourne the other day
for money had and received. He laid the
mm ter 3 to 1 Bicolor for the Hotham Handi-
cap—£7 10s. to £2 10s. There was a dead-
heat between Bicolor and Eridanus, and the
punter, entitled to £5, rushed the brief up
and yapped “A tenner Bicolor.” A confiding
gentleman, as we all are, the Tom paid out.
Finding later he was £5 shy, he sued the
shrewdie and got a verdict, though the bright
lad didn’t appear and can’t be found —they
never can. It is a saddening story of human
duplicity, and bears out what I have always
been preaching, that the maligned bookmaker
is really a self-sacrificing philanthropist
working under camouflage.
M.Q. (and Rafferty) Rules
Charlie Purdy, a much better lightweight
than he is credited with being, outclassed one
of the newly-arrived Filipinos, “Little Cow-
boy,” and knocked him out in the fifth round
of the brown lad’s first fight at the Sydney
Stadium. Stepping out of the way of the
Filipino’s awkward swing and coming back
like a streak of light, the pleasant-faced
Aucklander cut the colored gentleman to
pieces. A whizzing whang to the point was
the finishing punch. Purdy, who weighed
9st. 91b., 21b. more than the unhappy Fili-
pino, has developed into a really good man.
* * * *
Roy Storey is proving, with every fight,
that he is not only a rattling good boxer
but a terrific hitter. Up to Friday night
Garnet Juno, the Cessnock (N.S.W.) light-
weight, could boast' that he had never been
knocked off his feet, let alone knocked out.
Then he travelled to Leichhardt and met
the comparative novice, and got both in one
helping. Storey floored him in the first
round sent him down twice in the second
and had him practically “out to the wide”
when referee Pearl called a halt. Weights:
Storey, 9st. 6|lb/; Juno, 9st. 71b.
* * * *
Johnny Curley made his Australian debut
at the Sydney Stadium on Saturday night
and gained a points decision over Tommy
Barber, who,, at Bst. ll|lb., gave the Briton
51b. less 4oz, Curley was outpointed in the
first round, but after that he fought like
Cyclone Johnny Thompson, weaving in until
his bullet head met Barber’s face or body
and then banging away with both fists. The
smaller man fought with glorious pluck, but
he was several times badly rattled. Curley
is strong, persistent and hard-hitting, and
that’s about his kit.
* * * *
Saturday night’s fight at Melbourne
Stadium —Alf Stewart, list. 71b., and Tommy
Mclrines, list. 41b., were the principals—
was rather a scrambling affair, though not
devoid of bright patches. Some resounding
thwacks were given and returned at close
quarters. And in the seventh round there
was a clash of heads from which each warrior
emerged with a gash that exuded gore for
the rest of the 15 rounds. The decision
in favor of Stewart was the only one possible,
yet a section of the small crowd expressed
disapproval in voices thickened with beer.
Referee Quirk was the hardest-worked man
in the ring.
The Ins and Outs
The meeting of South Aus. and N.S.W.
at Sydney furnished some very entertaining
cricket, especially on the part of the youth-
ful Jackson, who made two centuries, 112
and 122. He was sent in first, as he is for his
club, and the change seemed to steady him,
though when he got his eye in he scored
brilliantly all round the wicket. His first
innings feat was all the more meritorious
since none of his mates gave him much assist-
ance, save Tommy Andrews, who knocked up
a useful 44. Wall, the South Aus. colt,
impressed very favorably with his fasti-
medium bowling in getting 4 for 51. Strongly
built, with a nice free action, he flies well
off the pitch. South Aus., in its turu, struck
trouble, the earlier batsmen, including
Schneider and Vic Richardson, failing to
sight Nicholls’s fast ones. The Windsor
youngster finished up with 5 wickets for 115,
as good a debut as any bowler of his type has
made in Sheffield cricket. Ryan (41), Hack
(50), Grimmett (54) and. Alexander (58)
came to the rescue for South Aus., Alexander
giving a charming display, but the knock
ended for 248, 43 fewer than the N.S.W. total.
Davidson, a colt ’keeper from Waverley, made
a bright first appearance in Oldfield’s place,
catching three batsmen and letting no byes
get past him. N.S.W. started shakily in the
second innings, losing Steele and Andrews for
18, but Kippax (58) helped Jackson to stem
the rot. Bradman contributed a dashing 73,
and Ratcliffs and Jordan helped with 30 and
31, the innings ending at 368. Scott got the
bowling honors with 5 for 108, Grimmett col-
lecting 4 for 137. South Aus. failed by 119
runs to get the 412 required, though Richard-
son (86) and Schneider (54) put up a good
fight.

After its first-innings score of 639 N.S.W.
looked “home and dried” in the match against
Queensland at Sydney Cricket Ground. The
Queenslanders were dismissed for 276, and
following on lost Litster for a blob. But
others rose to the occasion, and the second
innings reached 590. Higgins laid the wood
on in great style for 174, and Rowe made lus
second Sheffield century, 147. With 224 to
get N.S.W. found itself sparring desperately
for time on the last morning of the game.
Eight were down for 100, Nothling having
bowled as he never bowled before —5 for
39. Somehow or other Love and O’Brien,
the Newcastle bowler, managed to survive the
last breathless overs before time saved
N.S.W. from certain defeat. It was hard
luck for the Northerners, who fought their
way out of an almost hopeless position to a
winning one. The light aided the bowlers,
and Kippax, good sportsman as he is, refused
to appeal against it. A feature of the match
was the ’keeping of the Queensland skipper,
O’Connor, who caught 6 batsmen and
stumped one in the two innings and had only
9 sundries against him, leg-byes, of course,
included.
“Centurion”: Kippax, playing for N.S.W.
against Queensland in Sydney, gave the quid-
nuncs of cricket something to argue about.
When 123 lie mis-hit a no-ball, which
knocked the bails off. Kippax being out of
his ground, the Queensland ’keeper, with
ball in hand, pulled out a stump and
appealed for a run out; The ump. said “not
out,” and Kippax went on to score 315 n.o.*
and help his side to a win. Rule 28 makes
it clear that the batsman was out. It states:
“If in running or at any other time when
the ball is in play he (the batsman) be out
of his ground, and the wicket be struck down
by the ball after touching a fieldsman, or by
the hand or arm, with the hall in hand, of
any fieldsman —‘run out.’ ” “Instructions to
Umpires” make it clear that there is to be
no differentiation between the wicketkeeper
and other fieldsmen in such cases.
* * * *
“V.D.L.” : C. J. Eady has joined the ranks
of the select few who have had a memorial
erected in their honor while still this side
of the Styx. At Hobart last week a bronze
memorial commemorating his .services to
Tasmanian cricket was unveiled in the Tas.
C. A.’s pavilion. One recalls him as a power-
ful punishing batsman, and a fast bowler who
would be nearly in the champion class to-
day. He scored a pair of centuries in the
match against Victoria in 1895, and his 566
in a club match at Hobart still stands as
Australia’s record for any class of cricket.
With Harry Trott’s 1896 side in England,
Eady averaged 13.18 with the bat and took
16 wickets at a cost of 25.50 each. It is sad
to think that in the evening of his days lie
is a member of the Legislative Council.
* * * * •
“Hotliam” : E. L. a’Beckett, who routed the
Tassies at Hobart, playing for the Victorian
seconds, is regarded by the Yarraside cogno-
scenti as likely to step into the shoes of E.
A. McDonald. He has youth on his side,
for he left school in 1925, and as he is
described as having plenty of pace, good
length and a formidable yorker. he seems to
have the root of the matter in him, provided
that can be cultivated and brought to full
flower. In the meantime, the Vies, should
not neglect the substance for the shadow. In
Morton they have easily the best fast bowler
in Australia to-day, as actual achievement
goes, and one who, without doing anything
sensational, has got a steady run of wickets
in every match.
* * * *
“Past Grammar” : The search throughout
Australia for a match-winning bowler re-
calls that the pigheadedness of selectors is
more to blame than the failure of good men
to come forward. The belated recognition
of Don Blackie by the Victorians and
the Wandering Jew journeyings of Grim-
mett before South Australia granted him a
place in the inter-State side are well remem-
bered. Less recognised was the failure of
the Australian selectors to recognise the
merits of Hornibrook, of Queensland, in 1921.
The Englishmen came back from Brisbane
loud in the left-hander’s praise; Wilfrid
Rhodes went so far as to say that he should
be one of the first bowlers picked for the
English wickets. But the selectors chose
Hendry, then an orthodox batsman in the
second class, a right-hand bowler of the
same sort, and a good slip field. Sent to
Maoriland with an Australian XI, Horni-
brook took 84 wickets at a cost of a trifle
over 8 runs each. Recently so good a judge
as Macartney has stated that the Queens-
lander should have been included in the
1926 team. Perhaps the left-hander will get
his chance about 1935, by which time he
should have matured sufficiently—he is a
mere brat of 27 now.
# * * *
“Brom”: Cricket, to Ponsford, is a busi-
ness devoid of purple patches, because he
has long since absorbed all the purple it
can have for him. After returning to the
pavilion on the completion of his four-
century whack against Queensland, he broke
through a forest of back-patting hands to ask
a newspaper colleague if a “good thing” for
the races had got home that day. Later it
was suggested that the bat which had made
the record should be kept as a historical
souvenir. “What for?” he asked. “It is
still good enough to play with!” There you
have Ponsford. In a sense, he has become
part of the implement which he wields so
freely. As a cricketer he is without nerves
and without imagination.
Racquet and Bawl
Before the Davis Cup trials began in Mel-
bourne local tennis-writers gave Harry Hop-
man a very remote chance of getting into the
team. A great surprise awaited them, for the
Sydney youth did such things with the rac-
quet as to make it impossible for the selectors
to leave him out. On Thursday he con-
quered Hawkes (1-6, 6-4, 6-2, 7-5) ; on Fri-
day he vanquished Rowe (4-6, 6-4, 6-2, 6-3),
and on Saturday he settled the pretensions of
Moon (6-0, 6-4," 6-4)—-the Queenslander had
previously overcome Kalms. The lad’s skill
and courage were highly impressive. And in
doubles he did rather better than Patterson
in tussles with Hawkes and O’Hara Wood —
each team won a match. Hawkes proved he
was no back-number by beating Moon and
Cummings, and this, with his display in the
doubles, made him certain of a place in the
Davis Cup team along with Patterson, Craw-
ford and Hopman. There are a good many
who consider that Kalms, a great doubles
player and a mighty volleyer, should be
given a run. Still they can’t all get in.
* * * *
“15.30”: Before Jack Hawkes did so well
in the Davis Cup trials he was beaten by
11. Crebbin, an A-grade pennant man who
wields a racquet for Brighton, in a South
Yarra tournament. Undisturbed by the size
SMART WORK IN THE FIELD:
SAVING THE FOUR.
of the reputation before him, Crebbin plied
Hawkes’s feeble backhand with fast, low
shots, and. though often worked out of posi-
tion by the superior tactics of the inter-
national, managed to convert many seeming
losing situations into winners by the
accuracy and expertness of his returns.
Hawkes’s slow, high-winged break service
adds to his defects as a singles player, but as
a partner for Patterson in doubles he has
great merits.
* * * *
“Saaedi”: A funny little war has been
raging in N.S.W. lawn-tennis circles. The
L.T.A. started it by threatening to disqualify
players who should take part in any competi-
tion with which a professional was connected
as promoter or organiser. Almost immedi-
ately Herbert Edwards, a veteran coach,
announced an open tournament for school-
girls. In great agitation the L.T.A. announced
that infants playing in the tourney would
be declared “black.” Some schools were thus
bluffed out of entering a team, but others
defied the association, and though Edwards
was refused the use of the Rushcutter Bay
courts the affair took place. Soon afterwards
a girl who had played in the banned com-
petition nominated for an L.T.A. tourna-
ment at Pratten Park. Its bluff called, the
association had to choose between exhibiting
itself (1) as a petty persecutor of school-
children, and (2) as a weak-kneed body too
timid to stand by its own decisions. Gnash-
ing its toothless gums, it accepted the nomina-
tion, and the war was over for the time
being.
* * * *
N.S.W. country players showed up well
in the annual matches with city _ sides at
the Rushcutter Bay courts. Their No. 1
team downed the townies by 9 sets to 7,
R. G. Spencer, Guy Williams and W. B.
Walker being the stars. Walker, a lad with
a future (he is only 18), beat A. L. North
in straight sets. The metropolitans turned
the tables in the second-team matches, win-
ning by 14 sets to 2 sets, while both the
third and fourth teams scored victories over
the lads from Outback. In the women's
games, City prevailed in the first and second
grades, but Country was too good in the
third.
The Nineteenth Hole
“Brassey”: A Bulletin man’s suggestion
that something might be done to raise a
fund for sending a couple of our leading pro-
fessionals over to Britain to compete in the
open golf championship has aroused some
attention, particularly in South A.us., where
Rufus Stewart has so many admirers. Tas-
mania’s Len Nettlefold, who himself made an
impressive showing in the last British open,
is firmly of opinion that the general run of
golf in Australia is quite as good as it is
elsewhere, and, with Bobby Jones a non-
starter, there is no reason why, given the
luck inseparable from these great golf tour-
neys, an Australian should not land the
prize. Even if that is not done, the experi-
ence gained by the pros, would tend towards
the improvement of the game on this side
when the wanderers returned.
Hs $
“Crowball”: Young Dick Carr, who was
open golf champion of Queensland in 1926,
and was later displaced by Tommy Howard,
lias won the professional championship of
the State at the Royal Queensland course.
His opponent in the final was Arthur
Spence, now professional at the Hamilton
links, who holds the record for the Ken-
sington (N.S.W.) course. Spence made a
good fight of it, but the local product
finished 4 up and 3 to play.
* * * *
“Claypan” : An optimistic writer has pro-
vided the golfer with six golden rules for
becoming the Sir Philip Sidney of golf.
They begin with advice to the player not to
be “upset” when he muffs his tee shot at
the first hole, and end with an injunction
to apologise to the secretary for failing to
keep a match appointment. So there are
still people who believe in the coming of
the Millennium.
* * t- *
“0.P.H.”: Harry Allan, retiring Vic.
Under-Sec. for Lands, declared the other day
at a luncheon that golf wasn’t a sport but
an Institution, a Ceremony. Allan is in his
66th year and, so far as his friends are
aware, has only been an observer of and not
a participant in the Ceremony, but golfers
may now make an effort to capture him for
the links. Harry was no mean hand at
cricket in the days when brother Frank was
“the bowler of a century.”
“H.S.”: “X” (B. 22/12/’27) errs in
describing that match on the Lismore
(N.S.W.) links as “a mixed foursome.” It
was a “Canadian” mixed foursome, a very
different thing, especially on our course,
where the difficult holes are made easy for
the associate members. Further, the score
of 33 was no record. The record for the
course, 9 holes, is 32.
* * =S *
“Divot Digger”: One-armed players have
been numerous in Australia since the war,
and some are notably successful. Such a
one is Rowland Dore, of the Indooroopilly
club, near Brisbane, whose cards, as a rule,
are better than those of many of his double-
handed club mates, and who is particularly
straight and accurate, rarely getting off the
fairway. Rowland has lost his left arm, and
golf moralists up his way are averring that
his proficiency is a proof, if any were needed,
that the left-hand grip is the right-hand
golfer’s bane. One enthusiast urges players
with that unhappy tendency to hang on with
the left to drop it and practise one-handed
swings. The ideal solution, of course, would
be to cut off the offending arm, but even
golf enthusiasm can hardly rise to such
heights. Indeed it would be a disastrous
precedent in the case of those players who
cannot keep their heads still. Many a golfer
would be the better for keeping his head
down, but even in the case of the worst of
’em one would hesitate to decapitate him—
not till after due consideration, anyway.
Footbrawl
The hope that the Waratahs would beat
England at Twickenham on Saturday, and
thus rival the feat of their predecessors, the
Wallabies, was dashed; the Englishmen won
by IS to 11, after leading 15-5 at half-time.
They scored four tries, three of which were
converted, to three tries and a converted
goal. The English forwards proved a for-
midable hurdle. That was anticipated, but
the superiority in pace and cleverness of the
English backs was not, for it had never
before been in evidence on the tour. The
selectors took a risk in playing Jack Ford,
and, as it happened, his injured ankle gave
again, but the forwards generally were below
their previous form. In fact, England was
the better team on the day, though the
margin was never great. The second half
saw the Australians rally in fine style, and
with only seven points separating the teams
they tried desperately to break through. But
the defence was too dogged, and so our men
lost the one match of the tour which they
most desired to win. There was a vast
crowd, and the weather was fine and the
ground in good order. Of the 10 matches
played between England and Australia Eng-
land has won eight and this country two.
“J.H.” (Lon.) : No visiting team of
athletes has made so many friends among
British sportsmen as the Waratahs. The
clean play and the personality of the boys
are the chief reasons; and the tact and
commonsense of Gordon Shaw, their
manager, have helped. Of course, the boys
have their critics; archangels couldn’t
satisfy some of the Rugby purists here.
Breckenridge is their bete noir. I have seen
all the great wing-forwards in British,
Australian and M.L. Rugby for the past 25
years—Norman Rowe, Paddy Moran, Tom
Richards, Porter and Parker, Yoyce and
Pillman. I don’t believe one of them ex-
celled Breckenridge in ability to “spoil”
opposing halves and five-eighths without
breaking the rules. Of course, Brecken-
ridge has been penalised, but not more than
Yoyce or Pillman. Breckenridge, Jack
Ford and Blackwood —the cleverest hooker
English Rugby fields have known —have
been the great forwards of the side; Ross,
Tom Lawton and Sheehan the outstanding
backs. Sheehan is a master at cutting-out
openings. Since the selectors discovered
this fact, and made the further discovery
that Wallace’s right position is on the
wing, the back play has improved out of
all knowledge.
$ $ $ $
“Shrewsbury” : In the first of the European
international Rugby Union games Scotland,
victorious over the Waratahs, downed France
by 16 points to 6. The match was played
at St. Colombes, scene of many queer football
happenings, according to our ideas, and the
Parisian crowd seems to have run true to
form. Some decision of the referee, a son
of perfidious Albion, annoyed the Parisians,
and if he had leisure to listen he must have
learned a lot of colloquial French that isn't
found in manuals for young ladies’ boarding-
schools. In addition, they demanded his
blood, and after the final whistle did their
best to get it. Thanks to police protection
and a smart turn of foot, he reached his
dressing-room about half a jump ahead of the
nearest French barracker, and was later
smuggled out of a back gate under cover of
darkness. A Melbourne final couldn’t have
furnished prettier sport.

“Bore du Chemin”: The craze for creai
ing t new motor road records between Sydney
and Melbourne continues to rage unchecked,
the latest being the “whirlwind drive” (as
one of the Sydney dailies calls it) of E. J.
Buckley and L. Bartlett. It began at Sydney
at 4 a.m. last Saturday, and the journey to
Melbourne P.O. was covered in lOhrs. Slmin.,
averaging 53 m.p.h. The previous best was

lar Carbine of a car in F. A. Parle’s 4224
c.c. Vauxhall. It competed in every event
held by the club during 1927, being the
only one to do so, and scored 1642.94 reli-
ability points out of a possible 1700 —a
splendid testimonial to skilful driving (J.
J. O’Rourke was the driver) and car reli-
ability. In addition, the ’bus has collected
numerous wins in the speed, low-speed and
flexibility sections.

“Te Ivooti”: Races interesting to all Aus-
tralasian motorists are to be held at the
end of this month on Muriwai Beach, Maori-
land. Last year Hope Bartlett and G. Mere-
dith went across from N.S.W., and Bartlett
won two events. Now C. East, the Bugatti
driver, has been tuning up his machine in
preparation for a fly at the Maoriland cham-
pions.
* ■ * * *
“Chevroford”: I travelled hundreds of
miles recently in the Mallee of Vic., S.A.
and N. S. Wales. Roads boards have
thrown barrels of money away in construct-
ing metal tracks in these districts of little
traffic. Except where ground is definitely
swampy, the motorist ignores them and
makes his own roads alongside. The earth
track an ideal surface if traffic is
not too heavy. This is well enough recog-
nised in U.S.A. In spars.ely populated dis-
tricts there two earth tracks are laid down
parallel to one another and used alternately.
* *• * *
“Control”: There has been considerable
delay in publishing the results of the N.S.W.
Motor-cycle Club’s six-day trial, which was
begun on Christmas morning. Some of the
control cards arrived late, and a number
of protests had to be considered. In the
trade section L. Harris (Norton) and C.
Jamieson (Indian and sidecar) broke even,
with a loss of one point each. In the pri-
vate section C. Graham (Indian and side-
car) was first, with 8 points lost. In the
Sir Charles Wakefield Castrol Cup for trade
teams C. Weatherby, L. Harris and G.
Walker were in the lead with a loss of
63 points.

“First Aid” : “Whizz” is only too right when
he says (B. 29/12/’27) that things are get-
ting very dull at the Brisbane Speedway.
We all hoped for an extra thrill during the
holidays, and one of the machines and its
rider did catch fire, but the blaze was put out
before things got really interesting. There
was also a spill, but it is hardly worth men-
tioning. The fellow had only his collarbone
broken.
“Bullet-out”: Opperman’s chance in the
3000-odd miles race in France should be
good, but lie will need to avoid a mistake
made by two other Australians who had a
shot at it. At stopping places they noticed
that the French riders were partial to cham-
pagne, which seemed to buck them up a lot.
So they knocked the heads off a couple of
bottles themselves. But they were unused to
such fare, and it was not long before their
legs seemed to go; in short, they would have
boen better without the stuff. Still, Munro
and Kirkham put up a wonderful ride.
Miscellaneous
On the first day of the National Games
at Manly Jim Carlton, though just off the
Maoriland boat, won the 100 metres on a
heavy track in llsec. —the performance of
a real champion. The remarkable youngster
beat Parker, the Queenslander, by inches.
Carlton did not start in the 200 metres,
which was won by A. Walker (N.S.W.),
with Parker again in second place; the time
was 22 3-ssec. C. S. Stuart (N.S.W.), also
just returned from Maoriland. took the 800
metres in the slow time of 2min. 6sec., but
was never pressed. A rail accident pre-
vented the presence of W. M. Whyte and
G. R. Hyde, the Victorian cracks. A.
J. Watson, the Victorian, won the 110
metres hurdles in 16sec., and Victoria scored
again when L. B. Mason cleared 6ft. 2in. in
the high jump, beating the Australasian
champion, E. M. Davidson. C. M. Ebert
(N.S.W.) cleared 22ft. in the long jump and
also took the hop, step and jump event with
45ft. lin., beating Nick Winter, the Olympic
champion, who was nursing an injured knee,
by an inch.
* * * *
“Centurion” : Dr. R. J. Honner, a member
of the 1924 Olympic team, is back in N.S.W.
from Britain, where he has been taking a
special course in surgery. He was amateur
broad-jump champion of England in 1925-26,
being beaten last year by a German com-
petitor. He topped 25 feet for the broad
jump in Europe.
* * * *
“The Gaffer”: llow greatly professional
running has deteriorated in England was
shown last week, when J. Duffy, described
as the half-mile champion, won the once-
famous Powderhall Handicap of 180 yards
in 124 sec. off Hi yards. In other words,
it took him all that time to cover HBl
yards. Australian Jack Donaldson ran the
130 off scratch in 12sec. dead, and there
were some rare runners in England in Ins
day. Old Harry Plutcliens registered 12fsec.
It is stated that the attendance and the
wagering were low because of the competi-
tion of the tin hare, which is killing pro-
fessional pedestrianism. On the Powderhall
showing, it deserves to be killed.
* * * *
“Backwoodsman”: The Victorians again
upheld their supremacy in Australian bowls
last week, when a rink skippered by F. Hard-
man, of Toorak, won the championship of
Australia. As in the singles tourney, teams
from the other States were eliminated before
the semi-finals, the sole exception being the
N.S.W. rink led by Humphrey, which was
knocked out by Clarke’s Prahran rink in the
second semi-final. The Vies, won the four-
rink championship as well.
“Lao-dah”: In a Melbourne newspaper I
read that ‘Tlotkin had drawn a toucher, and,
as the players crossed over, was lying shot.”
At a bowls championship, too, with hundreds
of people present.
* * * *
“Hoop”: N.S.W. was again cast into
gloom when it heard that the English cro-
quet team had smashed through the State
side’s defence in the final match in Sydney.
A press expert asserts that the wiring of the
winners was wonderful. This probably
accounts for their getting the home team so
completely tied up.
“Mallet”: That insult which referred to
croquet as “hockey” (B. 5/l/’2B) is a flea-
bite compared with another atrocious error
into which the Sydney press has dived head-
long. The president of the Victorian C. A.
—don’t, for mercy’s sake, confuse that
“C.A.” with “Cricket Association”! —has
written a dignified letter of complaint to
Melbourne Argus pointing out that the Syd-
ney press has had the insolence to describe
the recent games between N.S.W. and the
English team as “Tests.” These N.S.W.
matches “do not appear on the official pro-
gramme of the Victorian C. A., at whose
invitation the English team came to Aus-
tralia.” The only genuine Tests are those
played under the superior aegis of the V.C.A.
All othei-s are bally impositions.
VIC. RICHARDSON, captain of the
South Aus. Sheffield Shield side, who
is to lead the Australian team to tour
Maoriland.
“Swan”: H. McKenzie has won the West-
ralian 100 yards swimming championship in
58 3-ssec. —not at all bad, especially con-
sidering that few of the Westralians ever
get a chance of improving their form by
meeting the Sydney and Melbourne cracks.
N. PI. Unbehaun, who collected the State
junior title for the distance, did 60 2-ssec.
This is very fast for a boy; indeed, it is
claimed as an Australian record. But junior
records change with such remarkable rapidity
in these days of child wonders that it is
a difficult job keeping up with them.
“Blade” : In spite of the name South Aus.
has made for itself in eight-oar rowing some
Central Staters are regarding the future
in a gloomy light. Writing of the forth-
coming inter-State race for the King’s Cup,
one of these pessimists notes the absence
of senior crews from the Berri and Renmark
regattas, declares that, the standard has fallen
away considerably and suggests that the
South Aus. rowing authorities may have to
consider whether it is worth while sending
a crew to Sydney. From a State which has
recently produced such crews as the Mur-
ray Bridge eight this seems almost too bad
FRANK DOBBIE, the Camberwell (Vic)
bowler, who won the singles champion-
ship of Australia at Melbourne.
to be true. Perhaps when the effects of the
holiday season have worn off a less dolor-
ous view will be taken.
* .-K :(=
“X.X.” : Now that honors for the sculling
championship are easy, Goodsell and Barry
having won one race each, the thoughts of
enthusiasts naturally turn to the arranging
of a third match. Goodsell’s backers are
willing, and Barry is willing, but the new
champion stipulates that the race must take
place on the Thames. In this he is follow-
ing precedent, though there have been de-
partures, notably the Arnst-Barry race on the
Zambesi and the late races at Vancouver.
According to a Goodsell communique, the
Australian’s determination to settle down
in Vancouver may prevent him from making
the long journey to England. A poor
excuse, if it was meant for one. Trickett,
Beach, Searle and Stanbury didn’t boggle
at going half round the world to chase or
defend the title, and transport conditions
were not as easy then as now. Stanbury
worked his passage over in a steamer’s
stokehold.
X H*
“Lievre”: Just how much your true
“sport” thinks of the tin hare when asked
to love her for herself alone is seen in the
announcement that Queensland’s first dog-
racing co., which carried on business at the
old Woollbongabba Cricket Ground, has gone
into voluntary liquidation. The Queensland
Government interdicted betting on the so-
called sport, and though the co. was per-
mitted to race at night it could not show
a profit. If the N.S.W. authorities had had
the sense to follow the Queensland and Vic-
torian example there, would have been no
need to bother about putting a stopper on
night racing.
1 H* •*»
“Acme” : There is a lot of sporting inter-
est in the announcement that the amateur
skating championship of England has been
held on the frozen Cambridgeshire fens, for
this particular event is only possible in the
years of severe frost; the last meeting was
held in 1912. In modern times the distinction
between the amateur and the professional has
sprung up, but the; championship has invari-
ably run in local families in both sections.
Only speed skating is engaged in, as against
the fancy and figure skating of the Con-
tinent. A mighty skater of old was “Fish”
Smart, who won regularly in the .’seventies
and ’eighties of last century; he passed the
title to a son, who kept it in the family for
years. Among the amateurs, A. E. Tebbit
w r as champion from 1895 to 1905; then he
went down to F. W. Dix. Dix has now been
beaten by W. Horn in 4min. 55 4-ssee. for
the mile and a half. The best time for the
race is Dix’s 4min. 374 sec. in 1908—say,
23 l-Bsec. to the furlong. This is well short
of the amateur ped.’s record for the furlong
of 201 sec., in spite of the popular notion
that the ice-skater can travel faster than the
man on foot.
Business, Robbery, etc.
Victoria has one shop to every 48 of its
population. Seems to he qualifying to justify
Napoleon’s jibe about the English being a
nation of shopkeepers.
❖ ❖ ❖ ❖
“Clarence” : Why does the house-to-house
peddler nearly always choose soap as his
stock-in-trade? Seven callers in one morn-
ing tried to sell me soap at my Sydney subur-
ban shack. Every housewife carries a stock,
and soap is usually thought of when the
grocer calls. In Yankeeland the itinerant
salesman invariably produces some labor-
saving appliance which, even if it goes to
pieces in a few days, attracts the eye and the
spare dollar.
* * « *
“FY7”: Ice and Cold Storage, a lead-
ing London organ of the trade, points out
that it has been demonstrated that meat can
be brought in a chilled state from the Antip-
odes, and it is now up to Australians “to
improve their stock till they can provide
meat worthy of chilling.” A frank but not
an unfriendly statement of the facts. Sooner
or later Australia will have to improve the
quality of its beef product, if it is to com-
pete with the Argentine. The present atti-
tude that “it can’t be done” was being ,said
a few months ago about chilling.
**• * *
“Mei” : No doubt we women are to blame
for the troubles of Bonds (B. 8/12/’27), but
can the other sex really claim credit for
using Australian-made goods more readily
than we do? My own experience of men
convinces me that, being snobs at heart,
they are afraid to use anything if its first
merit is cheapness. The manufacturers of
a certain Australian spirit advertise that it
costs less per nip than the imported. If
they understood human nature better they
would make it a little dearer, and lots of
men would drink it for the sake of being
thought free-spenders. As it is, they leave
it alone, for fear of being thought mean.
Women will buy Australian goods if they
cost less than the imported; men, having
much less commonsense, prefer them only if
they are dearer.
* * * #
“Simon”: When is Australia going to
make her own pearl buttons? Some of the
best pearl and trochus shell in the world
is found in the vicinity of Thursday Island
and the nor’-west coast of W.A., but the
pearlers complain that they are being more
and more squeezed by American buyers. A
few thousands in a home concern would
enable them to dictate terms. The vegetable
ivory that goes to make buttons for suitings
is also a product of the swampy part of the
Mandated Territories, and the manufacture
of this line could be made the next step.
* * * *
“M.G.S.”: Clapp and Cameron continue
to light as allies in ' Melbourne. The
New Y r ear slaughter of private ’bus lines
included one which had a' weekly patronage
of 9000 people, and had. helped to develop a
large suubrban district. Thirty ex-Diggers
will be out of a job in consequence,: with
their partially paid-off vehicles on their
hands, the law prohibiting them from being
used elsewhere.
* * * *
“Der Jong”: It is idle to say that there
isn’t a menace to the wool supremacy of
Australia and Maoriland in the latest
S’African figures. Durban handled 147,957
bales between September and December, an
increase of 47,250 bales on any previous
year, while Cape Town, Port Elizabeth and
East London all show big increase in ship-
ments. Of course, the Union is not yet
within coo-ee of the tremendous Austral-
asian export figures, hut considering her
white population is little more than a sixth
of that of Australia, wool production is
coming on at a notable rate. In 1925 it was
156,969,3341 b. Australia’s production for the
period 1924-25 was 729,242,5501 b. Propor-
tionately to white population, the Union is
actually producing more wool than Australia,
and much of it, in the fine-wool classes, is
of better quality.
* * * t-
“Jim Lynch”: Despite “W.1.U.” (B.
22/12/’27) there is likely to be a consider-
able reduction in traffic over the Silverton
tramway. Three thousand tons of coal are
required weekly on the line of lode. With-
out this freight from Port Pirie to Broken
Hill rates would have to be raised for land-
ing the ore at the Smelters. The main
Broken Hill companies are now considering
the use of crude oil. The cost will be
higher, but they estimate they can get it
back in reduced working costs in three
years. Sydney interests are stalking this
oil business; N. S. Wales could concede a
lower rate, with less handling, than S.A.
and the S. T. Co. combined. The volume
of passenger traffic during Christmas week
over the new line to Sydney was also a dis-
agreeable surprise to both S.A. and S. T.
Co. officials.

AWOMAN'S
LETTER
To cheer Time as lie was finishing another
round of the track, Tattersall’s flung open
Randwick for fair women, fast horses and
men of every description. The weather be-
haved perfectly, and summer frocking had
for once this season a chance to sport on
Amaryllis in brilliant sunshine. One of the
most striking-looking girls at the meeting
was young Rachel aoy Morton. In a mauve
organdie hat and a yellow organdie frock
she glowed like a spring border. Lady Grim-
thorpe, who has been staying with the G.-G.’s
in Melbourne, frolicked out with her lord
to see the more dashing gee-gees at Rand-
wick. Her Parma-violet frocking and dang-
ling ear-rings were allied to the newest thing
in elbow-length, grey suede gloves. The new
Mrs. Ellis Feilding Jones was another of the
much looked at. Mrs. \V. R. Bertram was
a_ study in ivory tones, and Chief Justice
Knox’s lady wore impeccable black and
white. Tom Hughes and his wife, who are
amon'gst this month’s outward bound, added
their fine presence to the picture. Mrs. E.
J. Watt wore one of the largest hats pre-
sent, and Mrs. Neville Frazer (Melbourne)
flew attractive Dryad greens and fawns.
Among Sydney press men and women the
most popular of the *New Year honors was
the distinction conferred on Mr. Budge,
official secretary to the Governor. He is
kndwn to every scribe in the city, and there
is probably not one whom he has not helped
in the matter of arranging an interview with
Government House celebrities, supplying an
address or pointing out strange knuts at
official functions. His position is like that
of the Vicar of Bray ; no matter what Gov-
ernor reigns he is still the official secretary.
What a book of memoirs will some day flow
fr<»m his pen! The ribbon to Chief Jus-
tice Street, too, does a good deal to rehabili-
tate knighthoods. And while his Honor com-
mands such respect on the bench that even
the most impudent; terrier at the bar behaves
himself in the Chief Justice’s Court, his
wife is busy about Sydney’s most practical
clfarities : and of these the cause of the Deaf
and Dumb makes a special appeal to her.
After a second visit to “The Cradle
Snatchers” on its revival last Saturday at
the Royal, this Letter is once more lost in
admiration of leading-woman Olive Sloane.
It is smitten not only by her irresistible
comedy work, but by the feminine charm of
her. Of course, with such a Persian kitten
prettiness the idea of her being a neglected
wife is hard to swallow. A husband who
would leave such a wife lying about loose
must be short-sighted physically as well as
mentally. The huge white-feather fan she
uses in the second act as a sort of emotional
shutter met with commendation of the first
order. A change in the cast brought the tall
Zillali Carter, who acted with the Repertory
in “The Philanderer,” into the ken of Syd-
ney audiences again. Hers was the part of
Kitty Ladd, who had the initiative of the
trio of neglected wives, but lacked the tena-
city of the ash-blonde Susan.
Just as this Letter slips into its pink
cover Moira Brady’s bridesmaids are climb-
ing into their, pink raiment to follow the
principal lady’s ivory satins up the aisle
of St. James’s. The sleek-haired man in the
case is Captain Broadhurst, chamberlain to
the. f Governor-General, and son of Captain
Broadhurst of the 14th Hussars. Moira’s
sister, Mrs. Ernest Watt, lias-arrived from
London, for the event, and later on will take
her mother back to England with her.
Moira Brady’s much-talked-of wedding-
dress was of pearly satin built in the style
of beloved by Morris in his
decorations. It was made with a clear
square, neck and wrist-long sleeves, and
its waist was girdled with hand-embroidered
pearls and. wrought silver thread with two
pendant pieces falling to the ground in
front. The tulle veil was drawn close to
the head, swathing the throat as was usual
in days of old; after that it billowed over
the transparent train of silk tulle, on which
a. lo’osely-tied bow of pearls and wrought-
silver thread was embroidered. A crystal
cross on a chain of pearls and a sheaf of
Ascension lilies were accurate details in the
bride’s outfit. The bridesmaids—Ann
Jamieson, Elizabeth Macarthur Onslow and
Rosemary Osborne—were charming anach-
ronisms in pale-pink chiffon. They wore
their skirts in double tiers, and their
picture hats were of pale-pink crochet lace.
Armlets of roses streaming to the ground
added a luscious effect. Captain Curtis,
A.D.C. to G.-G. Stonehaven, supported
Captain Broadhurst; and after the Bishop
of Ballarat and Padre Micklem had tied
the knot at St. James’s, the wedding guests
sipped Pekoe and champagne at the Brady
home in Macleay-street. The honeymoon
takes in a tour of Maoriland and an eyeful
of Europe.
Wagga rained confetti over an eventful
wedding last week. Dorothea Garrett, whose
father rules the local branch of the Bank of
N. S. Wales, not only lent her ears to the
vows of Dr. Laurence Lennon, but promised
to transfer them into his keeping. All of
which was duly recorded by Father Barry.
Silver lace over rosy georgettes, flounced as
to skirt and tight as to bodice, formed the
wedding garment, which was worn with a
filmy old lace veil and a sheaf of pink gladi-
oli. Silver lace and powder blue were mingled
in the period frock of the one bridesmaid.
Toasts were drunk at the Grand Hotel
under the administration of the bride’s
parents, Mr. and Mrs. Camden Garrett.
The bride's grandfather was that Tommy
Garrett who was a famous Lands Minister
in grandpa’s day. And even pa can re-
member Tom Garrett, an uncle, as one of the
great cricketers he used to cheer. The
groom, who practises in Wagga, is the
youngest son of the Lennons of Melbourne,
and formerly of Townsville.
Picturesque in her Victorian-built silver
laces and white moires, Marie Gilder, from
Muswellbrook, entered St. Philip’s Church
on father’s arm one night last week with
the usual intentions towards James Spencer
St. Heaps, of Bradley’s Head. From misty
depths of rare Honiton Marie made her re-
sponses, and Padre Kenderdine o.k.’d the
passport into matrimony, while sister Freda
sang “My Prayer.” Esmc Mackenzie, of
Fiji, was the only bridesmaid, and carried
a basket heaped with red roses in contrast
to her peach-pink georgettes. Mr. and Mrs.
A. J. Gilder set the consequent reception in
the Blue-room of the Wentworth.
One of the prettiest weddings of the week
was staged at St. Stephen's in Pliillip-street.
The bride, Elsie Margaret Gillespie, looking
as sweet as the boronia which gives its name
to her Ingleburn home, wore thistledown
pinks and silvers, a sunset effect being
obtained bv the silver train shining through
the clouds of pink tulle veil. Pink and
skyey-blue tulles mingled in decorative
fashion on the two bridesmaids. The young-
man who promised to attend to Elsie
Margaret’s wants in sickness and in health,
being Dr. Thomas Small, can at least make
some claim to be able to keep the promise
so fervently given by plumbers, bankers and
lawyers. The bride’s parents spread the
cakes and ale of the afternoon reception at
the Ambassadors.
Another country bride who . came to town
for the great surrender was Ethel Price,
daughter of the D. W. Prices, of Lairdoo,
Moree. The groom was Kenrick Vincent, of
Chatswood, and the twain left St. James’s
made one, though happily this fact passed un-
noticed by the waiters at the Ambassadors,
where, in company with the wedding guests,
the newly gyved breakfasted. Bride’s
mother and father did the honors.
This picture of Mrs. E. P. Fleming, wife of
Sydney’s head
Civic Commis-
sioner, was
made last week
for The Bul-
letin by May
Moore. But the
Letter is sorry
it cannot tell
intending
callers at the
Town Hall
anything con-
cerning their
prospective
hostess. When
interviewed
Mrs. Fleming
was sphinx-like
an d declared
that even on
the subject of
her hobbies and
interests she
had “nothing
to say.”
Sara Rosenbluin and Bernie Sugerman
were linked last week at the Great Syna-
gogue by Rabbi Cohen. Both are academic
lights of Sydney Jewry; the young man
is a lecturer in Law at the Sydney Uni. The
wedding group was an artistic composition
in the Early Victorian manner. The bride’s
ankle-length frock of Chantilly lace showed a
rosy lining, the one bridesmaid was a ruffle
of tulle frills on mauve satin from ankle to
waist, and a tiny page in lilac satin chimed
in with the color scheme. The Rabbi was
the principal guest at the following recep-
tion in the Maccabean Hall.
Fort Denison—the pictorial old greystone
wart in the middle of the Harbor, known to
over convict forebears as Pinchgut—was the
scene of a wedding party last week, for the
first time in its history. The bride in the
case was Chrissie Giles, of Mulgoa, a sister
of Mrs. W. C. Sumner, the chatelaine of
the hoary old fort; her husband is the officer
in charge. The ’groom was James Herbert
Campbell, of Lidcombe.
Beresford Howse, whose father was the
late Dr. Oswald Howse, of Macquarie-street,
joined the ranks of the married men last
week. His bride was Mary Foley, daughter
of a Murrumburrah family, and the vows
were exchanged at Wakele, the Foley home.
White georgette and silver fashioned into
tiers of frills swathed this bride, and sister
Leila ’maided in daffodil georgettes. A re-
ception and dance rounded off the event.
Here is a new picture of the wife of
Australian composer Alfred Hill. The lady
is not content to bask in reflected glory, but
uses a fluent
music-building
pen herself.
As Mir ri e
Solomon she
has been re-
sponsible for
several melo-
dious songs,
and was con-
sidered by Ver-
brugghen to be
one of the
most brilliant
musicians the
Con. had
turned out.
Mrs. Hill and
her husband
are strong sup-
ports of the
Australian
Composers’ As-
sociation. The
picture is from May Moore’s studio.
Four score youngsters who had never
glimpsed the sea found themselves last week
at Manly. Shepherded by the kindly Drum-
mond couple, these kiddies of the Par West
are having the wonder fortnight of their
lives. After the first apprehension of the
ceaseless rolling turbulence of the waves had
been overcome, the travellers settled down
with a blissful sigh for the long vista of
shining blue days. For three years the Rev.
Mr. Drummond has been responsible for
leading this flock out of the wilderness into

Many of the mites suffer from eye troubles
brought on by the sand and glare of their
surroundings, and while they are in Sydney
the advice of the best oculists is at their dis-
posal. Last week Sir Dudley and Lady de
Chair flung the grounds of Government House
open to the Westerners, together with a
soul-sufficing issue of ice-cream. The State
school at Manly is the present address of
probably the happiest citizens of Australia.
Left Australia last week for their home-
town, New York, the Ernest Jenks couple.
The young Americans had been seven years
in Sydney; their three children had all been
born between Darlinghurst and Darling
Point, and they candidly own that the pros-
pect of a lifetime in Australia would hold
no hardship for them. However, Mr. Jenks
is a director of the Alexander Hamilton
Institute, of which his father was one of
the founders, and after getting the Aus-
tralian end of the business smoothly running
his job is in New York. The pair are keen
golfers, great readers and lovers of Aus-
tralian art. They took away with them as
prized possessions a blue and gold glimpse
of the Harbor by Minns and a Maoriland
scene by Haworth.
Among the notables in Sydney before
moving into a vortex of science in Tasmania
is Professor Kirk, of Wellington (M.L.).
The ruddy-cheeked, blue-eyed scientist sits
in the chair of Biology. Daughter Ethel-
wyn, a clever musician, is with him.
Even on the days when the sun was hot,
a cool breeze tempered its rays to the
grim stragglers in last week’s Country Tennis
contests. The Lenglen bandeau, incidentally,
promises to be run a close second by the jaunty
peaked-cap, known as the Jackie Coogan,
adopted some time ago by American girl
players. The Helen Wills eye-shade, too, has
its adherents, and the comfort of the woollen
ankle-sock pulled over the lisle stocking was
proved by many of the girls who strove a-t
the White City.
The littlest one of the family came home
from Sunday school last week with a beam-
ing face. This was in such contrast to the
usual pained and bored expression which
Sabbath school had previously evoked that
mother was curious. “Did you like Sunday
school to-day?” she prompted tactfully. “Oh
yes,” he answered warmly. “I didn’t know
before that Christ was an Australian.” “An
Australian!” gasped mother. “Yes, Mother,
teacher told us -wherever He went He took
twelve ’possums.”
When the news reached Sydney that Lady
Sholto Douglas was rushing to Holywood
with a contract for the movies, all Leura
gave a gasp. Heavens! here was a meta-
morphosis from the Mrs. Mendelssohn Pickles
whose wildest excitement had been leaping
even as the hart among the mountain tops
in her motor-car of good repute, or hunting
an antique even into the lair of the savage
auction-wolf. Mrs. Mendelssohn Pickles is
Lady Sholto Douglas, therefore the film star
must be she. But Leura forgot there is
a former Lady Sholto Douglas, the dashing
lady of several divorces, who was married
to a Sultan just long enough to ascertain
that the market quotation for Sultanas was
falling fast. Incidentally she claims to
have the smallest foot iii England. Her
shoes are marked 14, but the Dame in the
panto, proved you can’t always tell the size
of a shoe by the marking. Taking oft' a
pair, size about 24, you remember, the Dame
coyly chalked them “small twos” and placed
them outside her hotel bedroom door.
There’s a new industry for clever fingers
in our own country. It’s the making of
music-rolls for the electric piano-player.
One firm on Parramatta-road responsible for
Mastertouch rolls -employs a small army
of girls in the making of captive music.
Twenty machines not unlike musical type-
writers are busy every day. Most of the
demand is for jazz, but there is a steady
call for operatic and ballad music, particu-
larly from the Outback, which is one of the
nicest things this Letter has been able to
say about the Outback this year.
Romano’s, Sydney’s new jazz absorber, is a
bird of quite different plumage from either
the Wentworth or the Ambassadors. The
first has space and a home-like air, due per-
haps to the canaries and the Pekinese about
the landscape, and to the fact that Mrs.
Maclurcan lives on the premises. The
Ambassadors has a beauty of architecture,
a fineness of detail, and a dancing floor
equal, so inveterate travellers say, to any-
thing in Europe or the United States. It
is smaller than the Wentworth, but much
larger than Romano’s. The last has a com-
paratively small dancing floor, with lights
underfoot —the effect when a lass in her
dancing flimsies pauses on one at the end of
a dance is illuminating. Habitues of cafes
abroad like the small and intimate note it
strikes and say it recalls the Cafe de Paris.
Of the fittings the crystal lamps appeal to
this Letter most; but the tapestries and
upholstery not at all.
Mrs. W. A. McDonald, who died on New
Year’s Day at Mosman, could claim that,
like Leda, she had been the cause of a
shower of gold. As pretty Kitty Slattery
she was one of the sweetest singers of the
early ’eighties, and when she raised her voice
at Temora, when that town was a busy gold-
fields centre, the miners were so carried away
by the sweet purity of her soprano that
they literally showered her with nuggets.
Another notable achievement was her sing-
ing during the Melbourne Exhibition of
1880. At a Liedertafel concert the young
soloist received a wild ovation from an audi-
ence of six thousand —a record for those
days. The Liedertafel later thrust on her,
by the hands of the Marquis of Normanby, a
necklet formed of 20 lyres of gold. Her
husband was for many years a London Bank
manager. Her two sons are H. L. McDonald,
public accountant, and Steff McDonald, the
actor who lias been seen in Sydney with
several English companies.
Belmont, the Philip Charleys’ beautiful
Ivurrajong home, which daughter Nell —Mrs.
Allan Harnett—said good-bye to last week
as she set out for a new one, was in the
early days known as Richmond Hill. It
comprises several holdings later consolidated
and named Belmont by Archibald Bell. One
of the small estates was owned by the
adventurous Margaret Catchpole, who lived
there from 1806 to her death in 1819.
Margaret combined farming with selling glad-
rags to the neighboring settlers.
Captain Pitt-Rivers, son-in-law to Lord
Forster, our one-time G.-G., has caused a
stir by airing his views on marriage to the
Eugenic Society in London. Maybe these
or similar announcements are made with
his tongue in his cheek, but they had been
heard already by some of his intimates in
Sydney. An apprenticeship to marriage, as
served by some of the native girls of Mel-
anesia, was spoken of approvingly by the
gallant captain, who further added that our
present system might be modified by a “form
of concubinage.” Quite so. But ought not
a man to be able to support one wife before
he introduces a second to the harem?
Josiah Francis, M.H.R., and his sparkling
little wife spent the year’s end in Sydney
enjoying the breakers at Collaroy and the
meeting of old friends and the making of
new. Mrs. Francis spent the whole of the
Parliamentary session at Canberra, which
she lias grown quite fond of. The radiant
health of the children there has deeply im-
pressed the Queenslander. Incidentally her
husband is a fine swimmer, and about two
years ago rescued a youngster from drown-
ing in St. Ivilda baths.

Chatter
The State Governor, wearing a cigar-
brown suit, was at Flemington for the first
V.R.C. meeting of 1925. A cool breeze and
sunshine brought out a holiday crowd ; but
society was still mostly at the hills or tlic-
sea. Notable visitors were Sir Philip Grey
Egerton and his lady, who are spending a
short holiady here. She was the handsome
first wife of baronet Rupert Clarke. Her gown
of black reversible satin had a full front of
white georgette trailed in black embroidery,
a very glossy black straw hat completing the
picture. Accompanying her was her sister,
Mrs. W. St. Leger Robertson, and Colonel
Robertson, the lady wearing navy blue Avith
hat to match. Commander Ireland, from Flin-
ders Base, was there with his wife, who was
attractively attired in a reseda-green jumper-
suit with bordering of stripes in fawn and
vieux-rose, and a nutmeg-tone straw hat.
Mrs. Felix Lloyd braved the breeze in biscuit-
colored lace and georgette with interludes
of floral embroidery. Her panama hat
sported a feather mount. Miss Collins wore
1 pretty confection of two shades of sweet-
pea pink, and harmonising hat. The Fred
Payne couple, the Richard Lintons, Mrs.
,T. B. McArthur, Mrs. R. Vincent from Gee-
>ong and her daughter Sammie, and the
Maudsley lady were other lookers-on.
The Macedon Women’s Institute, an off-
shoot of the Victoria League, held a fete on
Saturday. Its president is Lady Somers,
which accounts for the picturesque lawns of
Government Cottage becoming the site of a
busy market, with smartly-frocked matrons
and maids displaying wares beneath gaily-
colored umbrellas. Lady Somers, wearing a
rust-colored kasha coat over a frock of rep-
tile-skin patterned chiffon, with harmonising
hat, drove from Black Rock to say the open-
ing words, accompanying her being Lady
Caroline Agar in a sapphire-blue suit, lemon-
hued blouse and panama hat. Both ladies
took a hand in selling toys—fascinating
fabric and plush animals made by members
of the institute. Secretary Mrs. George
Stoving introduced her Ex., who received a
posy, and Mrs. Oswald Syme, a vice-presi-
dent of the branch, led the cheering. An
original venture was a lavender stall, where
all articles were of lavender hue, and were
filled with the perfume. Mrs. Norton Grim-
wade had for sale some unusual and attrac-
tive raffia-made table-mats, and Mrs. George
Landale ran a particularly opulent bran-pie.
Among Macedon residents who were helpers
or shoppers were the Hodges lady and Mrs.
Cameron. Others who toon part were the
Grenbry Outhwaites, the Mitchell lady and
her daughter Janet, Mrs. Leigh Falkner,
Evelyn Syme, IJ. H. Smith and his wife,
Mrs. Robert Bruce, Mrs. Chris A. Cowpei
and Mrs. Bevan. The Robert Knox couple,
who had a luncheon party at their home,
Willowmount, brought their guests to the
fSte, at which Robert Knox conducted a
golf competition and his wife provided the
prizes. Their guests included Mrs. Charlie
Lyon, charming in a white silk frock with a
dash of green, the Hugh Williams couple of
the Boucicault company. Miss Dupre, one of
the English croquet players, Major Edric
Henty and Captain Malcolm.
Lady Somers told this one at the Mace-
don fete. The parson had preached on
“Charity,” and so impressed an old lady that
when, outside her home, she saw a seedy-
looking individual leaning against a lamp-
post she shyly slipped a lOs.-note into h.s
hand. “What’s this for?” he asked.
“Charity,” whispered she, and fled. A day or
two afterwards her protegfi knocked at her
door and handed her £lO. “Wliat’s this for?”
asked she. “Well, mum, yer arst me ter put
yer 10 bob on Charity for yer, and ’e won the
City and Suburban at 20 to 1!”
The Davis Cup trial matches at Ivooyong
last week were watched by great crowds, and
enthusiasm was strong. Amongst the lookers-
on were Governor-General Stonehaven, Mrs.
Gerald Patterson, the Neville Frasers, the
Rupert Downes couple, Vera de Bavay, Joan
Newbigin and Mrs. L. Bracegirdle. The
weather was sunny but tempered most of
the time by a cool breeze, and fair watchers
wisely stuck to coats and skirts or jumper-
suits of some warmth. In cases where they
did sport summer raiment they had a kasha
coat handy.
Visitors to Sassafras this Christmas had
their holiday made pleasant by the efforts
of a committee of hard-working young men
and women. These young people aim to estab-
lish a completely-equipped recreation park
at the hills rendezvous. To gather in funds
a gymkhana and other sports were carried
on daily arid nightly for a week in the
reserve, which already boasts a tennis-
court, a bowling-green, and a dance-hall
with a splendid floor. Takings will mainly
go to pay for building the dance-hall. A
golf links is one of the projects of the
future. W. M. Hughes and Dame Mary,
now quite old residents, helped, and several
youthful sports from the city lent a hand.
The annual tennis rally at South Yarra
brought forth 450 entries—a record. Honors
in the women’s singles went to Esna Boyd,
and T. E. Robinson and Miss Boyd won the
mixed doubles. Edmund Jowett handed
the prizes to the victors.
Children on the lighthouses around the
Victorian coast will begin to think that
Santa Claus has given them a miss, for the
Lady Loch, which is freighted with Christ-
mas gifts, will be very late in reaching its
ports of call this year. The vessel has got
snarled in the seamen’s strike -and must
stay tied up till the trouble is over.
Archbishop Lees waved a genial farewell
from the deck of the Moldavia last week.
He leaves his see for a 10 months’ sojourn
abroad. There was a great gathering of the
clergy and their womenfolk on the wharf, and
a wealth of flowers and other parting gifts
was in evidence.
Dame Nellie Melba’s association with the
Firm’s grand opera venture of this year
should ensure society patronage and a cer-
tinty of the guinea seats being fully re-
served, thus enabling the management to regard
complacently the opposition of the Gonsalez
company. As musical director Melba will
concentrate largely upon the chorus, but of
course she won’t neglect other details. To
freshen herself for the fray she is going
to have a short holiday in Honolulu. On
Friday night the diva, whose white gown was
concealed beneath a cream coat with a frieze
of gold, looked in at the King’s to see, “All
the King’s Horses.” Colonel and Mrs. David-
son, the latter wearing a rose-patterned chif-
fon frock and a pastel-striped cloak, were in
the party.
Though the Cold Country, according to
cabled reports, is doing rather more than
usual to justify the name Tiie Bulletin
wished on to it donkey’s years ago, the
exodus of Australian trippers in that direc-
tion this year promises to be great. The
Orama carried off the Misses Turner, daugh-
ter of the late George Turner of political
fame; Richard Fitcher, of Flinders Lane,
who is off on a buying expedition, and the
E. W. Outhwaites and their daughter Joce-
lyn. The Philip Glass couple and daughter
Nina are to go abroad in March ; and Ethel
Leon, a moving spirit in the Professional and
Business Women’s Club, is also looking
forward to seeing the other side of the globe
at an early date.
Spencer Shier here presents Mildred Hand-
ley, one of Vic.’s three women councillors.
She was mainly responsible for persuading
the Government to put the Macedon tourist
road through
the shire of
Romsey, open-
ing up a lot of
scenic beauty
to the travel-
ler. She is
equally at
home running
a business in
the city, lead-
ing a deputa-
tion to a
Minister, de-
bating shire
affairs over the
council table,
or playing
Bach fugues.
The other day
she was given
a J.P. to tack
to her name.
Her husband
is Jack Hand-
ley, of the firm of Handley and Tilley, which
is proving that Australia can turn out
watch-cases equal to the “Made in Geneva”
variety.
Lady Stonehaven, like the State Governor,
sometimes gets tired of travelling in state.
Last week she quietly slipped off on a few
days’ motor tour attended only by her sec-
retary, Miss Gillett. They set out for Kos-
ciusko by way of the Gippsland lakes, and
are expected to get home to-morrow or Satur-
day.
Curator J. T. Smith, the guardian angel
of leaf and bud in our municipal gardens,
attended St. Paul’s Cathedral the other even-
ing and handed over his daughter Lilian Amy
to the safe keeping of Arthur Bennett, eldest
son of Padre and Mrs. A. A. Bennett of
Yallourn. The bridegroom’s father tied the
knot in workmanlike fashion. Ivory georg-
ette, silver lace and white tulle formed the
bride’s array, her two ’maids making an azure
background. The kiosk at Fitzroy Gardens
housed subsequent rejoicings.
lan McEachern, one of the brightest of
our young lawyers and a shining light in
golf, found St. John’s, Toorak, very nearly
full when he went there to wait for Mrs.
George Baillieu’s youngest daughter, Vida.
The bride smiled through a cloud of ivory
georgette falling to the ankles, furnished
with three tiers of fine Brussels lace. Grand-
ma’s veil of real Limerick cascaded richly
down the length of train, and in a coronet of
pearls was glimpsed a sprig of orange
blossom. Nell Stewart, who came from
Perth with the bride’s sister, Mrs. Walter
Stewart, just in time to act as maid, played
her part in pale pink georgette showered
with jewels, and a silver gleam clung to a
drooping crin. hat. Mrs. Baillieu, amidst
pink decorations, received at No. 9 after-
wards.
Mrs. Herbert Brookes, pictured here by
Lafayette, is a daughter of the late Alfred
Deakin. For many years she. has been
endeavoring to lift musical taste in this city
to a higher
standard, and
she has. been
a valued sup-
porter of the
U niversity
Symphony
Orchestra and
a member of
the Lady
N o rtneote
Trust. When
the Mi 11 io n

was launched
she became the
leading lady of
the senior com-
mittee. When
she is not en-
gaged in pro-
moting musical
development
she casts a presidential eye over the Women’s
Hospital.
Our navy is pointing a proud finger at
lan Macdonald, who trained as a cadet at
Jervis Bay. In London, where he is study-
ing signals and wireless mysteries, he has
won a medal by topping examination results
against all comers. This is his second
appearance in the limelight. On the previous
occasion he received the Royal Humane
Society’s decoration for rescuing a woman
from drowning.
Norman Belcher and T. Ellis, who set
out months ago in search of adventure in
South America, have returned to their native
Geelong. In five months they safely covered
50,000 miles of country. The pair halted m
the central pampas to call on A. E. Belcher
at his cattle-ranch, Estance el Madron, where
they assisted the boys at a round-up.
Mrs. T. P. Dunhill, who came from Fog-
town to see her daughter, Mrs. S. McCaughey,
is homeward bound again. Before her hus-
band decided to try his luck in the Empire’s
hub he had established a large reputation
as a throat specialist in this city, and Aus-
tralia still occupies a warm corner in his
heart. Many visiting Australians have found
a cheery welcome at his fireside.
Mary Buckley has returned for one. of her
brief visits, and is renewing acquaintance
with many friends. The Buckleys’ old home,
now St. Catherine’s School, was in its day
renowned for lavish hospitality, and the
family tradition is carried on by the daughter
of the house in her London flat, where Aus-
tralians are assured of a bright welcome.
Wives of officials bound for these Shores fre-
quently seek her assistance in selecting equip-

The Lauchie Mackinnon couple and two of
their sons will put to sea on Tuesday for a
year’s holiday in Europe. During their stay
abroad they will collect their eldest son, who
has been exercising his brain at Cambridge,
where he achieved his Blue. One of the
other boys will be left in his place.
Emily Solomon, world’s president of trie
W.C.T.U., whose addresses were a feature
of the annual conference here last year, has
since her return to S’Africa been giving her
impressions of Australia, and her account of
our domestic-service problems has sent a cold
shudder down the spines of her hearers, who
rejoice in a plentiful supply of subservient
colored labor.
Surgeon Julian Smith is planning to leave
a lucrative practice in March for a holiday
in London with his wife. The family just
now is all smiles, for daughter Roma and her
brother Geoffrey returned from Camperdown
tennis tournament covered with honors.
The Wisdoms have vacated Rab'aul Gov-
ernment House to cool off awhile in this city.
The holiday has a business side, and a hast
was made at Canberra to chat with the oil
experts who are going to ransack Papua
, during the next few years at the behest
of the Federal Government. Brigadicr-Gen-
, oral Wisdom finds his job congenial, and
his lady has taken lonely settlers under her
wing, one of her efforts being the formation
of a bush library. The gold fever brought
the Wisdoms from Scotland to Westralia o 7
years ago. Not finding much gold in mines,
the head of the house went into business,
prospered and became a mayor and a member
of the Westralian Assembly. Ihe Big
Scrap gave him a chance to demonstrate nis
military talents.
Gertrude Johnson, sending Christmas greet-
ings home, says she is longing to return and
see all her old friends, but engagements toi
the coming year have compelled her to pigeon-
hole the idea for a while. A new contract
to make gramophone records for the Columbia
Company has been signed.
Domestic troubles have settled thick and
fast around Vaughan Marshall, now super-
vising the production of “Caught m the
Net,” an Australian cinema venture. An
ammonia bottle exploded its contents m the
eyes of his eldest son, and just as, parental
anxieties were allayed the producer s mother
passed out and a funeral cast a gloom over
the opening of a new year.
Sam Clapliam, the wrestler, sending greet-
ings to Melbourne friends from Chicago, says
that most of the shows he has vis.ted have
been seen in Australia, and those that have
riot made the trip across are not worth send-
ing.
Word comes from the E. J. Gravestocks,
now in the U.S. looking for concert stars,
that in Chicago they met Bob Greig, who is
playing in “Countess Maritza,” and his wife,
Beatrice Holloway, whom they found to be
a great stage favorite in those parts.
One of the sufferers under the Old Dart’s
record-breaking winter is E. J. Carroll, of
theatrical fame, who is marooned in Fog-
town with a bad attack of tonsilitis. He
writes that he would be willing to pay £lOO
for a ray of home-grown sunshine, but that’s
something that can’t be exported.
Women artists are farewelling fellow-
painter Norah Gurdon, who is booked for
Europe to seek fresh inspiration. She is
to set out with her sister next week.
Mrs. J. A. Boyd, mother of tennis-cham-
pion Esna, had a bit of bad luck last week.
Being away from her St. Kilda home for a
few days, she asked her husband to put her
jewellery, worth about £4OO, in liis city office
safe. Burglars visited there on Friday night
and took the lot. And the worst of it is that
the insurance policy was voided by removing
the trinkets from the house.
Eileen O’Keefe, who will be on her way
back from Europe in the Narkunda by the
time this gets into print, writes from Paris
that she saw some particularly fine acting
in a French version of Barrie’s play “The
Old Dady Shows Her Medals,” presented
under the title “Da Vieille Maman.” Bertha
Bovy, an actress of ingenue roles, a
triumph as Mrs. Dowey. Miss O’Keefe had
a special interest in this production, for her
pupils gave a couple of remarkably good per-
formances of the play here a year ago.
Travellers lately returned from London are
exhibiting to an envious circle the creations
of a young English designer, Norman Hart-
nell, who has discovered a _ talent for the
fashioning and coloring of feminine attire. A
Cambridge graduate, he found that the arts to
which he felt attracted had been monopolised
by women, so he neatly turned the tables by
exploiting the vanities of the nowdered. sex.
Prospective brides on the alert for new ideas
will be interested to learn that the wedding-
gown he designed for London’s prettiest
society girl, Lady Mary Tliynne, was ankle-
length. the full skirt of ivory panne velvet
being furnished with a Gothic design in silver
tissue which lined the long court train. Pearls
and diamonds were used sparingly to outline
waist, sleeves and neck. Five thousand people
waited outside St. Margaret’s, Westminster,
to see the bride.
America has adopted a fashion in coiffures
new to this generation, but popular in
France twelve decades ago, says a returned
traveller. White hair is all the rage and even
the youngest matrons are succumbing to the
charm, with the result that bleached shingles
are bobbing up in all directions. Once the
deed is done, a powder that maintains a
freshly laundered appearance is frequently
applied.
Those who remember the E. M. Bridges
couple—he was for years the manager of the
Flinders-street Savings Bank —will regret to
hear that Mrs. Bridges passed over at the
end of last year at Tunbridge Wells, Eng-
land, where they settled after his retirement.
“A.G.M.’s” note from London :
Those who have been wondering why Princess
Mary was not more in evidence with members ot
the York household are satisfied at last that all
parties are friends, for the Duke and Duchess have
been spending three days at Goldsborough Hall,
Knaresborough, with Lord Lascelles and his royal
lady, and a picture has been published of the four
in a group, with welcoming villagers in the back-
ground and the famous smile making sunshine in
a Yorkshire November. Moreover all the babies have
been photographed together.

We could pack an inferior article like the

policy for both buyer and seller to sacrifice
quality for cheapness. The enormous sale of

A fine day blessed the race meeting at
Ascot. The Goodwins were accompanied by
Colonel and Mrs. N. A. H. Campbell, and
Mrs. Isaac Moore and the Loram couple,
from Ayr, were with the v.-r. party. Lady
Goodwin wore black and white; Mrs. Camp-
bell was in pink; Mrs. Isaac Moore wore
cream georgette; and Mrs. A. V. Loram
chose petal-pink. Mrs. Cecil Palmer was
in ivory; Miss E. O’Shea wore blonde-
rose ; Phyllis Cowlishaw was in green ; Mrs.
Arthur Clark sported shell-pink; Naera
Sampson wore green and cherry, and Mrs.
Jack Fihelly chose navy and saxe. The
Cadell Garricks, the Spencer Browns and
the Frank Halls were on the lawn.
Sir John Goodwin went to Darling Downs
Amateur Race Club’s meeting at Clifford
Park, and decorated the winners of the
bracelet and bangle events. Amongst the
pretty frocks was that of Mrs. Grant,
Bowenville, a pink crepe de Chine, worn
with a black ribbon hat. Mrs. R. C.
Hogarth looked smart in leaf-green Shan-
tung, in patterns of blue and pink; Shirley
Dent, Sydney, sported white with a latticed
border of red, and Florence of
Warwick, chose shell-pink and white. Kitty
Lord, of Victoria Downs, wore white and
blue; the Groom lady selected ashes of
roses, broidered in blue and gold, and Mrs.
Campbell was in blue. Others present were
Mrs. J. H. Fairfax, the D’Arcy Wintens,
Dr. and Mrs. Spencer Roberts, Mrs. Won-
derley and Mrs. H. T. Symington, the last-
named in an almond-green race coat.
Mrs. I J . J. Syines had a party for her
niece, Grace Edmondson, of Melbourne, at
Nethercene, Ascot. Royale Journeaux,
Tessa Reading, Eve Jeffrey, Betty Anning,
and the officers and cadets of the Wangaratta
were amongst the dancers.
Mrs. T. J. Ryan organised a ball at the
Grande, Southport, with a grand march of
some fifty strong in fancy dress. Jill Ryan
and Jack Magee, as bride and bridegroom,
were adjudged the best-dressed pair.
Steele Rudd’s picture, “The Romance of
Runnibede,” is on here, and His Majesty’s
is getting ready for Moscoviteh. At Cre-
morne, “Aladdin” holds the boards. “Abie’s
Irish Rose” is at the Empire, and the Good-
wins have visited the newly-decorated
theatre. M. L. Reading received the v.-r.
party, and Barrington Waters provided
lovely bouquets for Lady Goodwin and Mrs.
Jolly, who was there with the Mayor.
The Jondaryan Kents and Lyndall Mc-
Phie have been staying at Government
House. There was a dinner party at.
which Blair, C.J., Dr. and Mrs. Kerwin
and daughter Nell, and the Glyn-Connollys,
E. K. Tulleys and H. Morts were guests.
One point on which we score over southern
cities is our suburban building regulations.
Houses can’t be huddled close together, as is
permitted in even the toniest suburbs of
Sydney and Melbourne, but must stand apart
in dignified isolation. This gives room for
trees, and our suburban homes nestle in an
array of greenery that surprises visitors.
One result of the stand-apart ordinance is a
progressive improvement in home architec-
ture. The four-walled box that will serve
for one of a close-packed row shows up
too meanly when three sides are open to
public inspection.
TASMANIA.
Hobart.
The principal social event of last week
was the wedding of Peggy, second daughter
of the G. S. Chapmans, to Ted Lines, son of
one of our medicoes. St. David’s Cathedral
was the setting, and the bride walked up the
aisle in white net encrusted with crystal-
drops followed by a long, narrow train of
white satin, edged with silver tissue and
crystal and silver embroidery, and lined with
flesh-pink chiffon. Her head-dress was of
diamente and orange buds, surmounting a
white tulle veil. A bouquet of white car-
nations tied with silver ribbon was carried.
The two Clarke girls, of Quorn, Campbell
Town, her cousins, attended the bride in
salmon-pink lace frocks over satin of the
same shade, the scalloped flounces on the
skirts being edged with heavy silver em-
broidery. Head-dresses in bandeau style of
pink and diamente and pink bouquets com-
pleted the effect. There were rejoicings at the
Imperial afterwards.
Heavenly weather drew crowds to the
Brighton race-meeting, which is a picnic
affair for Hobart folk. The course was in
perfect condition after the light rain some
days before, and the racing was exciting.
Tom Lyons added another to his long list of
wins with Prince Viol, who carried off the
Brighton Cup. Many parties went from
town by rail and motor.
Far-seeing folk who booked their rooms
in Hobart for January and February have
the laugh of those who are hunting desper-
ately for bed and board. The Science Con-
gress, opening to-morrow, has brought over
600 visitors, who will stay for a week if not
longer, and the Rotarians’ conference early
in February will bring another 400; there
will be the usual crowd of tourists, besides.
Among the visitors are Prof. Edgeworth
David and his lady, who will stay with Mrs.
Hungerford in Holebrook-place for the
Science Congress week, and Douglas Mawson,
of Antartic fame, who will be the guest of
the Arndell Lewises.
Manager Beckley, of the Cascade brewery,
celebrated the opening of the new plant by
a reception at his home, where he and Mrs.
Beckley entertained the Elliott Lewises, the
de Bavays, the Thomas Lyonses and many
visitors from the mainland. The guests in-
spected the new brewery.
The Allan Wilkie performance of “Alls
Well That Ends Well,” said to be the first
in the Southern Hemisphere, drew full
houses for three nights. Costumes and
scenery were gorgeous, and the lighting
effects extraordinarily good.
Artist Mabel Hookey and her sister Dora
have set out upon a second European tour.
During their last trip they spent some time
in out-of-the-way spots in Ireland, where
material for sketches, pictorial and literary,
was gathered.
Arthur Chanter, the Melbourne musician
who made the mistake of being born in the
right country at the wrong time —the chances
are that he will now never get his operas
produced—has been spending his vacation in
Hobart. Music-teachers and students were
invited to meet him at Heathorn’s the other
day, and he entertained them with a talk on
technique and expression in piano-playing,
illustrated by a recital of original composi-
tions, along with some little things by
Chopin and Bach.
WESTRALIA.
Perth.
New gowns and cheery sunshades paraded
at Belmont when Phoenix Park won the
Perth Cup, and a cool breeze provided a
corrective to the tradition that Cup Day is
always a roaster. Lady Campion smiled on
the winners in lace-trimmed dove-grey georg-
ette, with hat and footwear of the same
soft tone. Mrs. Charlie Wittenoom wore
sulphur crSpe, and Mrs. M. P. Durack coffee
lace and georgettes. Marion Padbury chose
an ensemble effect in smoke-grey; Maisie
Mitchell contrasted an apricot frock and a
lemon hat; Mrs. Bertie Wilkinson wore
black and a leaf-swathed hat, and white was
favored by Hilary Smith and Stella Meagher.
Maud Mitchell chose tucks and pleats in
jade-green.
Some comical garments coaxed a smile
even from persistent backers of the also
ran. A beaded evening gown was worn by
one brave lady in conjunction with a velvet
cape. Another appeared in a canary-yellow
gown decorated with swinging purple fringe,
topped by a bewildering feathered headpiece.
A tribute to heroic womankind was a
mangled georgette sleeve lying on the grass
outside the ladies’ tote. It is to be hoped
the divvy was sufficient to cover the cost
of a ruined gown.
This is Bardwell Clarke’s likeness of Edna
Cook, who for
six years has
been general
secretary o f
the Silver
Chain Nursing
League. The
sick poor are
tended by the
nurses of her
organisation
and the society
provides cot-
tage homes for
old folk. Miss
Cook travels
extensively,
forging new
links in the
chain of good
works by ex-
plaining her
mission in out-
b a c k town-
ships and bush
homes. A kiddies’ page in the Western
Mail keeps young folk interested in the
league.
The Repertory Club chose Barrie’s deli-
cate comedy “Alice Sit by the Fire” for its
latest production. Moira Tivey and Helen
Ambrose did splendidly, and Mrs. Robert
Cameron was a very fascinating Alice.
A romance which budded six months ago,
behind the footlights of “The Optimist,”
produced by Anita Fitzgerald, blossomed
early the other morning at St. Brigid’s,
when Miss Fitzgerald shed her maiden name
to become the life-partner of John Le
Tessier, who hails from Guernsey, Channel
Islands. The tall bride wore flounced cream
lace and a lace veil. Gwen Wilson attended
in cream and primrose.
SOUTH AUSTRALIA.
Adelaide. ■
To the S.A.J.C. meeting went Lieut.-
Governor Murray, who takes it as a duty,
not a pleasure. Sir Henry Cowan and his
Wife brought their daughter, who viewed the
races through a silver lorgnette. Mrs.
Whitmore Carr, wife of the chairman, enter-
tained in fawn georgette, and hat to match.
Mayoress Bonython was in black crepe de
Chine and a black hat, with a floral shoulder
posy as relief. Lady Cowan lost a bag full
of bank notes, which was picked up near
the totalis ator and returned.
A morning tea for the Cowans, given at
the Town Hall by the Mayoress, was quite
a society gathering. After cups and cakes
had been handed round by pretty Ada Bony-
thon and her young friends, there was
speechifying by the Mayor, Sir Henry
Cowan and Lady Cowan.
The marriage of an elderly bachelor, Canon
Hewgill, of St. Andrew’s, Walkerville, to
Lenna, daughter of Mrs. Richmond Baker, of
Northgate-street, Unley, filled St. John’s, Hali-
fax-street, to overflowing on a recent after-
noon, and there was a large sprinkling of
clergy in the throng. The bride, very much
his junior, has long been given to good
works. She is a niece of the Brown lady,
who was present at the wedding.
Mrs. S. J. Jacobs, of Glenelg, accompanied
by Miss Burton, leaves by the Orama for
England on a visit to three married daugh-
ters.
At the gathering of old colonists at Glenelg,
the oldest present was Mrs. E. Merrett. Her
parents, the G. McKay couple, arrived in
South Australia in 1838, and Mrs. Merrett
was born in 1839. Last year Miss Marianne
Fisher headed the list. She has since died
after scoring her century. Several of the
old ladies made brief speeches at the
luncheon. It is the one day in the year
when grandpa and grandma take the lime-
light and they wouldn’t miss it for anything.
Wives of the aldermen and councillors
assisted Mayoress Rugless to entertain the
old ladies. The male veterans lunched with
the Lieut.-Governor and the Mayor.

NEVER READ YOUR POEM IN THE
PUB.
[Pop. The Bulletin.]
Still they point the moral, still the yarn goes
round
In secluded taverns where the bards are
found.
“Never mix your verses with your beer,” they
say,
“Drinking’s done for pleasure; verse is writ
for pay.”
When his name is mentioned everybody
groans—
This is why we hated Adam Lindsay Jones:
Callously impervious to rebuff and snub,
He would read his poems to us in the pub.
Christened Adam Lindsay, Jones at tender
age
Studied elocution, soon became the rage
Spouting at the concerts all around the
place
“Man from Snowy River,” “Rio Grande’s
Last Race.”
Then he put the horsey jingle on the shelf,
Being resolved to render poems by himself.
Hideous the habit holding him in thrall,
Woe betide the stranger pinned against the
wall!
While the counter-lunches others would
devour.
Jones was blind to beauty, reading by the
hour
Reams of verse rejected by some jealous sub.;
Couldn’t dodge his lucubrations in the pub.
Came a Friday even when we heard afar
Jones declaiming ballads in a George-street
bar.
In the midst of seamen frolicsome with rum
Lo, his voice was booming like a Zulu drum.
How the riot started no one ever knew,
Or who hurled the pewter that poor Jouesy
slew.
But the moral’s obvious as a rum-and-shrub :
Never read your poems, brother, in the pub.
n.s.w. Mervyn O’Hara.
“P.1.C.A.”: Years ago I read in The
Bulletin that newsagents were in the habit
of keeping mum over the paid-in-advance
subscriptions that include Christmas Day
and Good Friday. Casually I mentioned this
to the household treasurer when she was on
the way to pay our last account. At the first
intimation of the errand, in a shopful of cus-
tomers, Mercury pantomimed for silence and
gently pushed twopence across the counter!
“A”: Archbishop Duliig, of Brisbane, is
now proprietor of two newspapers, the Age
and the Sunday Visitor. The former will
be rub as “the official organ” of the R.C.
church in Queensland. Archbishop Mannix,
of Melbourne, is also proprietor of two news-
papers—the Tribune and the Advocate. The
two Catholic weeklies of Sydney, however —
the Catholic Press and Freeman —are run
by local companies, with a representative
body of clergy on the directorate of the
former.
“Clark”: The Victorian Railways
Magazine is not to die, union officials not-
withstanding. Commissioner .Clapp fought
tooth and nail to save it when Labor Minis-
ter Tunnecliffe decreed its abolition. He
advanced schemes for reducing the cost,
and even intimated his readiness to try to
sell it to railmen. In the end Tunnecliffe
changed his mind and said the publication
could continue as a free issue, provided it
was reduced somewhat in size and certain
economies were effected.
“The Traveller”: I doubt if many Vic.
railwaymen look coldly on the V. R.
Magazin because it preaches the beauties
of hard work (B. 29/12/’27). Of the 29,000
copies presented to employees it is probable
that half are unread, and a large percentage
never ' opened. The average railwayman
wants to forget railways when off the job.
Again, the policy of praising the service as a
whole, while coming down on individuals, is
the last thing likely to popularise Clapp's
publication. My own experience is that men
who try to get on according to methods that
would commend themselves to the magazine
are generally very objectionable people. They
are usually trying to jump over seniors’
heads by working points and keeping in
with the boss.
“Lao-dah” : Except for their photogravure
sections the Maoriland weeklies are poor
things, so it has fallen on a daily newspaper
proprietary to do for the inky talent of the
Shivery Islands what The Bulletin is
doing in Australia. Some years ago the
Christchurch Sun made readers rub their
eyes by intimating its readiness to pay for
local contributions. Its offshoot, the Auck-
land Sun, is following suit. Its first Christ-
mas (1927) competition brought to light
no fewer than 700 storytellers and poets, some
of them of a high order. The first prize
for a 2000-word story (won by Iris Wilkin-
son, a promising young Wellington writer)
was 10 guineas—incredible munificence for
Maoriland, most of whose editors have a
fixed formula for native authors: “Is it a
freewill offering”—hopefully—“or”—with an
intimidating stare —“do you expect to be
paid?”
“J. M. Inverell” : “Topee” (B. 29/12/’27)
claims that he once drew £l5 14s. 6d. for a
single word in The Bulletin —the correct
answer to a “missing word” competition
—in 1594. I have never bragged about
it, but I was one of the 37 who con-
tributed words (and bobs) to the first com-
petition and scooped the small pool. Public
interest was soon aroused and the second
word was worth £315 2s. It was divided
between two individuals, and I was lucky
enough to be one of them. In the last com-
petition before the Attorney-General stepped
in I was so satisfied that the word was
“indiscriminating” that I sent it in five
times and drew five dividends of £l9 Is. each.
Even before this, my fame as a word-guesser
had spread so much that I was pestered by
people for suggestions.

Sydney Royal rocked again on Saturday
night to a revival of “Cradle Snatchers,” the
comedy where the quips are all aimed at the
husband who goes roaming in the gloaming
with a lassie by his side, said lassie in this
case being snugly fitted into a car of expen-
sive make. Sydney has laughed often already
over the absurd situations featured when
three neglected wives of three flapper-
hunting husbands decide to annex three lie-
flappers just to see how their lords will
take a dose of the medicine they thought
good enough for their lawful ladies. As the
volatile, pretty and flirtatious Susan Martin,
Olive Sloane was once again irresistibly
funny, fluttering on the edge of vulgarity
and yet always keeping just a gossamer
thread away from it. The Ethel Drake of
Bertha Belmore of the bullfrog voice is
intensely comic because it is the picture of
a humorless woman forced into saying and
doing the most ridiculous things, and never
glimpsing they are at all funny. Miss Bel-
more’s is an admirable piece of work. Zillah
Carter’s Kitty Ladd was just a trifle too
intense in the opening scene for this thistle-
down madness. The three youths bought
and paid for by the frolicsome matrons were
dull blades when they had the stage to
themselves, but bright enough in company
with the ladies. The short season ends on
the 20th.
“The Girl Friend” continues to fill
Her Majesty’s in Sydney nightly, the warb-
ling and toe-tripping of Annie Croft being
a refreshing change from the equipment
of the average musical-comedy actress.
Ben Travers’s riotous and quick-moving
comedy, “A Cuckoo in the Nest,” is keep-
ing Criterion audiences in a simmer of
merriment. Ben’s “Rookery Nook” follows
the present piece. There is no sign of the
brake being applied at the St. James, where
Elsie Prince and Jimmy Godden are steering
“Archie” to what promises to be a record
spin for this house. Well staged and well
dressed, “The Film Girl” remains firmly
entrenched at the Empire, and emotional
Muriel Starr keeps the Palace feverishly
thrilled by her dual role of female counter-
jumper and lady of luxury in “Cornered.”
“Mother Goose” preens her feathers at the
Grand Opera House. Irene Vanbrugh and
Dion Boucicault will be on view at the
Royal in Somerset Maugham’s drama “The
Letter,” on Saturday week.
St. James’s Hall, Phillip-street, Sydney,
doesn't provide an ideal stage for bovrilised
thrillers, but producer Gaston Mervale con-
tinues to serve up unusual and gripping
entertainment with his quintette of Grand
Guignol plays. Among those who are
putting in good and vigorous work are lon
Maxwell, Hilda Dorrington, one-time Allan
Wilkie’s leading lady, and Isobcl Gawler,
late of Duncan Macdougall’s Playbox.
A revue and ordinary vaudeville share the
programme at Sydney Tivoli this week. The
Philmers do their tight-rope turn with such
ease and grace as to suggest that they could
nonchalantly travel along overhead tramwires
if they were put to it. Millie Doris is an
energetic dance and monologue specialist
who keeps the house in a merry mood; and
the Big Four show themselves humorous
songsters. Hard work should come easy to
those Herculean persons, the Angel Brothers,
if they are ever out of a stage job. “Dancing
Time,” the revue that fills the second half
of the programme, is a speedy affair of whirl-
wind sketches, snappy burlesques and a large
quantity of song and dance. The Di Gatano
trio are to the fore among the toe-trippers,
and Davey Jamieson shines in his solo danc-
ing turns as well as in conjunction with the
Eight Darlings. Included in the company
are Hector St. Clair, the comedian with the
fiddle and the mobile countenance, and the
tuneful Syd Burchall. The skit on “White
Cargo” is the best humorous interlude in the
revue. :
* * *
Now that Jim Gerald is no longer under
the necessity of making a weekly change in
his programme at Fuller’s, that sprightly '
comedian is showing himself more spon-
taneously humorous than ever as Mrs. Dolly
Dimples, the dame of “Pantomime Revels.”
Anything that might pass for a plot is ;
dropped overboard early in the piece and a
few old hoary panto, tricks could join them
and not be missed.
* -r ❖ *
The romance of “Madame Pompadour”
is being re-told on the silver sheet at the
Lyceum, and although most of the dignity
and purposefulness of the lady disappears
beneath Dorothy Gish’s interpretation of
the part, much of the glamor and color of
the story is preserved. At the same house
Monte Blue dons the overalls of a loco,
engineer and pilots “The Black Diamond
Express” through a series of exciting adven-
tures.. High production expenses are appar-
ent in “Fighting Love,” which emerged from
the De Mille studio and is now at the Hay-
market. The medieval chapel wherein a
wedding ceremony is performed must have
cost a fortune to erect, but, for all the
expenditure, the film is only fair. “Singed,”
at the Empress and Hoyt’s, is the tale of a
get-rich-quick saloon lounger’s somersault
from villainy to sickly righteousness. In
“The Crystal Cup” Dorothy MacKaill is
masquerading as a member of the stronger
sex at the Empress. Under the same roof
Hoot Gibson, the “Hero on Horseback,”
turns banker without discarding his Wild
West habits and manner of dressing. Ex-
tended season features that are still going
strong are “Resurrection” at the Crystal
Palace, “What Price Glory” at the Prince
Edward, and “False Shame” at the Adyar
Hall.
At Melbourne King’s “All the King's
Horses” will display Irene Vanbrugh in a
part that fits her like a glove for one week
longer; after which the welcome season
abruptly ends. “The Alarm Clock” continues
to tick pleasantly at the Athenseum, whose
advt. in the dailies risks international com-
plications with our friends across the Tas-
man by speaking of Molly Raynor as “the
charming young Australian actress” in letters
unprecedentedly large. At the Princess the
history of “Robinson Crusoe” continues to
be told in pantomimic terms by a galaxy of
beauty and Clem Dawe.

Dreading the possibility that the public
might declare “Queen High” at Melb. Royal
a busted flush, the management imported
three dancers (one male, two female) last
week direct from the Folies, the Parisian
playhouse where nudity is more in order
than it is in the Solomon Islands. In addi-
tion, Irene North stood down from the part
of Polly Nettleton in favor of Thelma Bur-
ness. The Australian has the indifferent
voice which seems to be inseparable from
excessively yellow hair these days, but her
warble is quite adequate to the needs of the
maudlin fugues it has to share with
Leyland Hodgson. Also she is a personable

The Di Gatanos’ revue danced itself into

Melbourne Tivoli is concerned on Saturday.

Melbourne Majestic screen is this week
straining its two dimensions to accommodate
the skirts of “Madame Pompadour.” The
favorite of Louis XV.—assigned to the
fourteenth Louis in the advt.—is portrayed
by Dorothy Gish, who adds to the stock-in-
trade of the usual Hollywood flapper an
impressive repertoire of hoop skirts and wigs
waved in a manner far beyond the resources
of a pre-electric age. The. Gish girl doesn’t
even touch the romantic depths plumbed by
sturdy Beppie de Vries, who played the part
in the flesh a few months ago. Nevertlie-

less, she is arch and cuddlesome enough in
the numerous scenes in which she makes
love with the pothouse artist, Rene, who
finds no difficulty in hugging a girl sur-
rounded with sufficient wire to rabbit-proof
the Riverina. “The Fire Brigade” is being
called out twice daily at Hoyt’s, where the
eyes of the multitude are also riveted upon
the adolescent emotions of Sally Phipps in
“The High School Hero.”
Frank Talbot of the Athenaeum values the
reputation of liis playhouse as a home for
intelligent entertainment, so he was a trifle
dubious when the suggestion was made of
turning it over to the motion pictures for
a season. But a trial run of “Chang,” the
proposed flicker, satisfied him. “Chang” has
been an immense success in the U.K. and
America, where even highbrows have left
their academic firesides to see it. It is the
story of a Siamese couple’s battle with the
jungle, and the wild animal photography in
it is remarkable. It will start as soon as
“The Alarm Clock” runs down.
A cool spell since Christmas has assisted
in the success of the Nellie Bramle.y season
at Adelaide Theatre Royal. “Beware of
Widows” is playing to big houses; the ever-
green “Camille” comes later, but Nellie is
at her best in comedy. George Storey and
company are supplying amusing vaudeville
with some good vocal numbers at the
Majestic, and the ballet is particularly good.
At West’s “Hills of Kentucky” is showing
that Rin-Tin-Tin can hold his own against
Harold Lloyd or any other screen favorite.
In the second film, “Honesty is the Best
Policy,” the star, Pauline Starke, dashes
her motor-car through a stone wall and comes
out alive. The York Theatre is featuring
a thrilling trial in “The Thirteenth Juror,”
where a great criminal lawyer has to defend
a friend charged with a murder that the
lawyer himself has committed. At the
Garden Theatre Pat Hanna’s Diggers are
putting on good programmes. At the Won-
dergraph Theatre “Foreign Devils” provides
some eye-openers on the Boxer Rebellion.
The Grand Theatre features a melodrama of
the high seas in “The Royal American,” with
“The Millionaire Cowboy” for the supporting
film.
“I. Phelps”: Conrad doesn’t film well,
and no dramatist lias yet turned any of his
novels into acceptable plays. Still, Basil
Macdonald Hastings, remembered here for
the razor-edged philosophy of “The New
Sin,” is tackling “Victory” and hopes to
have a manuscript good enough for Margaret
Bannerman to bring to Australia. Margaret
will have a varied repertoire; her main suit,
“Our Betters,” is expected to make the
churchwardenish critics lay in a heavy
supply of burnt feathers.
Nero ’: "Crime,” one of the plays Leon
Cordon is to produce, is an American crook
melodrama by Samuel Shipman and John B.
Hymer; it has been a winner at the Queen’s
Theatre, London. The cast comprises 35
principals and an army of supers, so there
will be room for at least a few Australians.
fhe leading part in London is taken by
Louis Kimball, who was first seen in Aus-
traha in “Under Fire,” and afterwards with
Muriel Starr.
Hamfat : America has been celebrating
the 7oth anniversary of the production of
Lncle lorn's Cabin.” Charles W. Taylor
staged the first version of the book at the
3”° wery Nationai Theatre, opening on August
-o, 1852, but for some amazing reason he
excluded the most popular ingredients in
"Uncle Tom —Eva and Topsy—and his
show failed. The first successful version
was put on at the Troy (N.Y.) Museum
late m September. Since then various ver-
sions have been running constantly, and
there are nowadays a number of tent shows
which live entirely on the darky drama. The
Little Eva of the Troy production, Cordelia
Howard (her father was manager of
theatre and played St. Clair), is still alive.
She was four years old when she lisped the
lines of the saintly stage child.
“W. Spokeshave”: A facet of a late actor
rhat hasn’t been mentioned was his harmless
vanity. With failing physical power he
became more than ever anxious to impress
audiences with his absorption in his roles.
On the nights when he did Shakspearean
heroes a stagehand was always told off to
prepare a basin of soapsuds. As soon as
the last curtain fell the veteran would rush
to the wings, plunge both hands into the
basin and plaster his face with suds. The
next moment the audience was wildly
applauding the mummer whose superhuman
exertions in the cause of public entertain-
ment had covered his countenance with
glistening beads of moisture.
. “Goldilocks” : Lilian Harvey, an English
girl, has become the favorite screen actress
of Germany. She was bom at Muswell Hill,
London, but when seven years old went to
Germany, and the war kept the family there
—it was refused permission to leave. Lilian
made her name as a child dancer, and
Richard Eichberg, the German picture-
producer, offered her a contract. Now she
is being boomed in pictures which are meant
for world-screening—“ Crazy Mazie” is the
title of the first.
“I. Phelps”: Margaret Bannerman, the
Firm’s star offering for the opening of its
new comedy theatre in Melbourne next
March, will start in “Our Betters.” Her
baggage will also include “Diplomacy,” “The
Golden Calf” and “The Voice from the
Minaret.” Stanley Bell, originally one of
Beerbohm Tree’s young men and for a long
time manager for Val Prinsep and Marie
Lohr, will be the producer. The R.A.F.
found Bell’s war service worthy of the Air
Force Cross and the rank of Lieut.-Colonel.
“Cauboy”: If there is. such a thing as
immortality for musical comedies, “The
Merry Widow” seems to be about the only
one likely to enjoy it. Beppie de Vries
will try her Dutch accent, her charming
personality and her barely sufficient voice
on it after “The Student Prince” has shot
its bolt in Melbourne. James Liddy will
invite comparisons with Andrew Higginson
as Prince Danilo.
“Santander” : “Our Betters,” in which the
Firm hopes to introduce Margaret Banner-
man to Australia, is one of the bright
chapters in the troubled financial history of
Val Prinsep—surely one of the most cour-
ageous of all producers. Prinsep, whom our
Marie Lohr married and divorced, has dipped
heavily into his overdraft in efforts to stage
plays that no other manager would touch.
Some of his losses make ludicrous, if tragic,
reading, but the amount he cleared from
“Our Betters” must have been particularly
sweet to him, since he was the only one wil-
ling to put it on after it had made its
author footsore carting it round London. On
its initial run at the Globe it did 69 weeks to
excellent business.
’ “I- Phelps”: Sybil Arundale, still perky
and piquant on the edge of 50, has lately
relieved Marie Tempest of her leading part
in “Cat’s Cradle” in England, and has been
doing very well with it. Sybil has developed
histrionically since she was in Australia, and
though she will still do principal boys and
musicomedy parts, she aspires to exhibit her-
self in Ibsen, Shakspeara and Shaw. With
the veteran J. T. Grein she is to produca
“The Wild Duck,” “Hedda Gabler” and
“Ghosts,” and if I know my Arundale she
will be seen in one or more of the principal
parts.
“8.C,” : John Henry Clyndes, who was a
good stock actor in Melbourne 30 years or
more ago, has passed out in London at 86.
He took to the boards in 1874. and was in
the original casts of “Love and Money,” “The
Lord Harry” and other mostly forgotten
pieces.

WHISKEY
the J.J. whiskey we sell to-day is
made in Dublin by the old and ex-
pensive Pot Still method —the same
method that we used in 1780. For by
no other process is it possible to
produce the same quite unusual soft-
ness and the generous full John
Jameson flavour.

SHARES OFFERED FOR SUBSCRIPTION.
Of the 100 000 “D” 8£ p.c. Cumulative Participating Preference Shares, the issue of
which was authorised during last year, 75,000 have been subscribed, leaving only
25,000 still available. . , _ ..
Subscriptions are now invited for these 25,000 shares, payable 2/6 on application
and the balance in full on allotment, or 2/6 on allotment and 5/- per share on Ist
March, 1928, 5/- per share on the Ist June, 1928, and the balance of 5/- per share
on Ist September, 1928, at the option of the applicant. Dividends will be calculated
as from date of payment. „ ,
These “D” shares rank for dividend, and for return of capital, beloie the 1j
Ordinary Shares of the Company, and they further participate in the profits of the
Company equally with the “B” Ordinary Shares, after the B Ordinary Shares shall
have received p.c., but with a total limit to the D Shares of 10 p.c.
The following facts regarding this investment are worthy of the special notice
of investors, viz:—
The business, which has been established about a quarter of a century, is the
largest of its kind in the British Empire. It has followed a policy of liberal treat-
ment of purchasers and honest value in selling, and its name and methods are
favorably known throughout the Commonwealth. The experience thus gained,
and the reputation built up during this long period, form an asset which, while
it cannot be expressed in figures, is of far-reaching importance. .
The Company has earned an average of 11.47 per cent, on its capital dui mg
the past 7 years. The “B” Ordinary Shareholders have been paid during the past
7 years dividends ranging from 6 p.c. to 8 p.c. per annum, and m addition have
received 100,000 Bonus Shares of £1 each, representing the capitalisation of part
of the profits accumulated in the Reserve Fund. No further capitalisation 01
reserves can be made without the consent of the holders of D Shares.
The Company has made quarterly payments of the dividend on the Preference
Shares during the past 8 years. This privilege is extended to l 'D” Shareholders
When the whole of the authorised issue of 100,000 “D” shares have been
allotted and paid up, they will have a security of £380,000 to protect them,
equal to £3/16/- per share. , A , ,
The assets of the Company, as shown m the Balance Sheet, appear at cost,
or less, and have been conservatively valued, and do not include any intangible
assets such as Goodwill, etc. The City Properties alone are taken in at £35,000
less than the valuation placed upon them by Richardson and Wrench, Ltd
A return of 8i p.c. per annum so amply secured, with the prospect of an
increase to as much as 10 p.c. per annum, must be regarded as a very attractive
investment.
Those desirous of taking up shares in the new issue are invited to fill in and sign
the application, form hereunder and return to the company s office together with
cheque for two shillings and sixpence (2/6) per share. Payable on application.

Poverty
Point
“Cauboy”: Herscliell Ilenlere, the slap-
stick pianist who had the curtain lowered on
his head at a show in England, was the
same sort of oyster in Australia. Once at
the stool and with an appreciative audience,
neither the hotvls of the management nor
the abuse of other performers waiting to
come on would remove him. One night at
Melbourne Tivoli he held the fort for 40
minutes, so the next night he found himself
the last item on the bill. This was an
opportunity the French Canadian could not
let by. He played encore after encore, while
the audience missed its train, the supers
yawned and the hand grew restive. Finally
the cloth was rudely dropped and the
orchestra struck up “God Save.” But
Henlere was undismayed. The audience de-
parted, the staff locked up and the night
watchman began his rounds, but strains of
jazz and Beethoven continued to drift
through the curtain. It was 3 a.m. before
they subsided into silence.
“Frank Jay”: Twenty-odd years back
Leon Caron, one-time Williamson musical
genius, introduced me to his kid daughter
Irma. Recently, I wandered into a Jewish
concert hall in New York and re-met Irma,
now Mrs. Adams, as the star and only turn
—she married “Starky” Adams, The Bul-
letin’s old sporting man. In Maori costume
she talked about N.Z., and sang and danced
for . nearly two hours to an appreciative
audience. It was her Poi dance that really
got the crowd. The New York Education
Department sponsored the show.
“I- Phelps”: Bayard Veiller, author of
“Within the Law” and proud father of “The
Trial of Mary Dugan,” shortly to be pre-
sented by the Firm in Melbourne, received
a commission a while back to dramatise
Sinclair Lewis’s novel “Elmer Gantry,” and
with a present of 1000 dollars advance
royalties to sharpen his fancy, charged
straight at the job. He was half-way
through it when news of his industry
reached the Church and Drama Association,
of New York, which is alleged to have
threatened violent action if such an evil and
preposterous reverend as Elmer were un-
loosed on the Broadway stage. Though the
association denies that it made any such
threats, it seems significant that Veiller has
suddenly found the task fatiguing and re-
turned 4he 1000 dollars.
“J.H.” (Lond.) : No English playwright
arouses such contending passions in his first-
night patrons as Noel Coward. His wor-
shippers (in the stalls) and his detractors
(in the gallery), both lots fanatics, throw
wordy brickbats about at curtain-fall —
epithets like “swine,” “curs” and “dirty
dogs” exchanging joyously. The first night
of “Home Chat,” with Madge Titheradge
starring, was riotous enough, but the row
was mild compared with that at “Sirocco,”
which, in material and reception, justified
its name. At the close stalls and gallery
started a frenzied slanging match, while
Noel stood before the curtain hand-in-hand
with Frances Doble, his leading lady,
smiling sardonically. A few cliuckers-out
are badly needed in some London theatres.
“Tenakohe”: Joe Morris, playing the
Goose in the Sydney Opera House production
of “Mother Goose,” is as active as a tin
hare; yet I first saw him doing acrobatic
stunts at Paddy’s Market 40 years ago, and
he was the star of Fitzgerald’s Circus tumb-
ling troupe during a great season at the
Benevolent Society’s ground—where the Cen-
tral Station now stands —in 1893. Another
such durable person is F. M. (Mick) Jones,
who for years was Fitzgerald’s clown and
mighty leaper. Mick casually mentioned the
other day that if any of the charity-fund
organisations got up a show he would give
his services and repeat his blood-curdling
double somersault over 20 horses with 40
men with fixed bayonets firing into the air as
he revolved towards the mattress. And
Mick is nearer 65 than 60.
“Black Out” : “Kelby” is surely a bit out
when he says Australians “suffered” Madge
Elliott and Clarice Hardwick “with mild en-
thusiasm” (B. 29/12/’27). Madge was always
popular here. As for Clarice, this scribe on
this page predicted her London success many
years ago. Clarice was better equipped for
London musical-comedy than any other
Australian girl, but as a kid dancer with
Genee’s ballet her musical-comedy face and
manner always kept her back.
“Wood’s Green” (Lond.) : The Sitwells
have revealed themselves to a Sunday audi-
ence in a Sitwell play at the Aits Theatre
Club, a recent playhouse that holds about
200 people—all Sitwell believers. Someons
has wittily described the Sitwells as not so
much a family as a conspiracy. They cer-
tainly act up to each other, and they write
clever stuff. The play, “First-class Passen-
gers Only,” was by the brothers Osbert and
Sacheverell, who took part in one scene with
poetess sister Edith. There was not much
story, but the smart talk made up for lack
of plot, and a loud-speaker declaimed several
Sitwell poems; quite a commercial experi-
THE TRIBULATIONS OF . THE SURF.
“What sort of breakers give you most trouble , Brownie?”
“Ooh, I think the heart-breakers are the worst.”
ment. Edith Sitwell —whose picture in the
Tate Gallery shows her as a tall, thin,
ethereal sort of creature with long nervous
hands—has told the public that she and her
brothers live under the shadow of a legend.
“Hamfat”: Melba gets a mention in “This
London,” by R. Thurston Hopkins, who
loves the stones of the fog city as a seaman
loves his _ rum. Hopkins says that when
Melba paid him a business visit she always
advanced aggressively with a cry of “Hands
up !” He has never seen her serious—she
is a great humorist with a disposition to
gentle skylarking; and she uses the smallest
cheques he has ever seen. There is a good deal
of new stuff on Melba in the book, including
the information that “she makes fun of
everybody and everything, including herself.”
What a good time she must have joking
about her farewell concert!
“A.G.M.” (Lond.) : Thomas Beecham, in
detailing his scheme for a nation’s opera,
instances the difficulty an English singer has
to make headway in his own country.
Edoardo di Giovanni is a first favorite in
Italv, one of the best tenors in the world.
As Edward Johnson he was unknown in Eng-
land. Herr Piccaver, the tenor of the
Viennese Opera House, is a Lincolnshire man
named Peckover.
“Santander”: Ever since James Liddy
arrived in Melbourne to demonstrate his
loveliness in “The Student Prince” I have
been confronted with paragraphs affirming
his. wonder as a baseballsr, footballer and
swimmer, and furnishing special comment on
the quality of the left which laid out all the
amateur welters along the Pacific coast of
America. The witless reiteration of Liddy's
muscular development would not be so stir-
ring if one did not remember that various
other Williamson stars, notoriously incap-
able of sufficient stamina to catch a Mel-
bourne cable-tram, have also been enrolled
among the proud race of Hackenschmidts. I
suggest to the Firm that the next genius
it imports should be allowed to lose his
jewels or be proclaimed as one who has been
half-eaten by Bolsheviks. We haven’t heard
of any Valentino suffering in this way since
it was decided to stencil the news that
-every musical comedy actress was dying to
lead a bush life and live on damper and
billy tea.
“Cauboy”: With Owen Nares, Margaret
Bannerman and others coming to Australia
while still in the prime of life, or just over
the threshold of it, one might conclude that
the policy of fetching hither stars just as
they are setting had been changed. But no!
The real reason is that times were never so
bad in London for home-grown actors, owing
to the influx of Americans and the fact
that Noo Yojk is now the theatrical world-
metropolis. Plays are better put on there
and methods more enterprising than any-
where else. So more and more darlings of
the London boards are likely to discover sud-
denly that they have been dying all their
lives to visit these antipodes.
“Goldilocks”: There will be no big glit-
tering of musical stars in 1928. The bottom
fell out of the boom which started with the
successes of Kreisler and Galli-Curci; and
the Taits, at least, are not likely to arrange
fixtures to clash with their grand-opera ven-
ture. Last year Paderewski, Melba, Heifetz,
Friedman, Zimbalist, Frances Alda and
Hislop made a remarkable sequence. The
stars trod upon one another’s heels until
music-lovers’ finances were exhausted; then
houses slumped disastrously. It was hard
luck for Concert Tours, Ltd., a group of
local enthusiasts whose fingers were badly
burned. They came in when the goldmine
was worked out. Carrolls, the original pro-
spectors, made a fortune.
“Sam Slocum” : Recent cables from Eng-
land have enthused over a moving picture
produced by an amateur theatrical troupe at
Reading. But there is really no reason why,
with present-day facilities, amateurs should
not do as well as pros. Eighteen years ago,
when picture production was only a nipper
and methods mostly primitive, George Mar-
low, supported by a mixed company, produced
a picture at Rockhampton (Q.) in which
Elkin and Taylor, two taxi-drivers of that
city, played in roles as important as any
others in the story. And a darned good
movie it was, too.
“Snowhite”: In the amateur theatricals
in which he often appeared when a boy
J. M. Barrie always filled a female-character
part. Whether he had a preference for the
lady’s lines or whether his fellow actors
insisted on his taking them has never been
explained. Tim little plays were written by
Barrie and performed at Dumfries Academy,
so the dramatic instinct developed in him
early. Barrie was very shy and quiet in-
those days.
“C-B.”: When a foreigner tried to tell me
the other day that he had seen the Van-
brugh-Boucicault co. I realised what a wond-
rous thing the English language is. Out of
the 18 letters in the two words two similar
consonants are pronounced differently, and
four are not pronounced at all, and only one
of the seven vowels is given its correct value
—if there is such a thing.
“L. de R.” : St. Kilda has been steadily
growing in importance as a competitor with
the metropolis for the attention of the
amusement-loving throng, but hitherto it has
confined itself to the movies, dance-parlors
of unbelievable sumptuousness and thrills of
the intoxicated chair, scenic railway and
Katzenjammer-eastle variety. On Jan. 7,
the Cairo, on the Esplanade, which has been
remodelled as an up-to-date flesh-an’-blood
theatre, will present Humphrey Bishop’s
musical comedy company, described as a “dis-
tinguished company of London artists, now
in their twelfth consecutive year of trium-
phant success.” The name of the master-
piece of music and muscle hasn’t been re-
vealed yet. The co. has been seen in Mel-
bourne before.
“Kelby”: No special art is required to
play the mock-orchestras that film people
call “organs,” despite press boost to the
contrary. Any intelligent and accomplished
organist could play all that is required after
a little practice. Yet the Sydney Prince
Edward has already had two Yankees on the
job, and I have yet to learn that an Austra-
lian was even considered. At this particular
show the organist, the conductor of the
orchestra and the films are all imported.
However, I have it on very good authority
that the ushers are allowed to be chosen in
Australia.
“Rob P.”: Australian composers should
give an eye to music suitable for school
orchestras and amateur orchestral societies.
Wanting some non-technical, though tuneful,
sets recently, I found that the few available
were all American. English and Australian
publishers had only professional, which is
mostly too difficult for students. American
publishers cater specially for colleges, high
schools and even home orchestras with folios
of non-technical marches, waltzes, overtures,
etc., a complete folio being usually allotted
to one composer. The royalties from these
may not be so handsome as from jazz hits,
but there should at least be a profit. The
simplest American arrangements, I notice,
are not despised by even top-notch picture-
show orchestras.
“Csesar’s Ghost”: The film business has
enormously increased the testatory will-power
of those who make a business of entertaining
the world. Up till recently the million
Barnum left at his death was easily a
record theatrical fortune; but Marcus Loew,
the American film man, left 10 millions when
he died the other day. Loew was one of the
first men to see possibilities in the movies.
He got in on the ground floor of many new
ventures.
“Mugwumpian”: To Simon Ranter our
local parson, picture-shows were anathema,
to be ranked, with dancc-lnills, as inventions
of the Devil. Blistering sermons had been
preached by him on ‘The Evil that Walkoth
in Darkness” and “The Lamp of Iniquity,”
but when a bolting motor-car bumped
Brother Simon hurriedly to Heaven the finest
wreath on his casket bore the inscription
“In Loving Memory.—From the Local Pic-
tures.” Later it was discovered that the
girl at the florist’s had bungled the tele-
phone message. The tribute had been sent
by the local preachers.
“Hamfat” : His 53 years are not checking
Vincent Taylor’s enthusiasm for dare-
devilry. Last July the Australian hair-
raiser “shot” the Idaho falls and rapids;
and on September 5 he made a parachute
descent from the Upper Arch Bridge at
Niagara into the boiling waters of the river
below the falls. The parachute dropped on
top of him, but he succeeded in swimming
clear. Immediately after that performance
Taylor undertook to go through the Whirl-
pool Rapids in his rubber suit. He intends
to jump off all the high bridges in New
York, before going to Paris to make a
parachute descent from the Eiffel Tower.
He hopes, if he survives it all, that a
balloon race in connection with the Sydney
Exhibition will give him an excuse for re-
turning to his own country.
“L.H.P.”: “Lakme,” Delibes’s three-act
opera, is the only novelty mentioned in the
Fuller-Gonsalez list. Australians will like
the melodious music; certainly it likes the
Bell Song frequently heard on concert plat-
forms. Patti sang the title-role in 1890. The
plot is somewhat like that of “Madame
Butterfly.” An English army officer is madly
in love with an Indian girl; he leaves her
and marries an English woman.
“Flaming Youth”: In a reference to the
popularity of “Uncle Tom’s Cabin,” the
Saturday Evening Post mentions that the
drama was “playing both the Prince of
Wales and the Grand Theatres, Sydney, in
May, 1926.” The Grand Opera House,
where Nellie Bramley revived the old thing,
with George Cross as Uncle Tom, is evidently
one of the places; the other is a mystery.
The “Cabin” has not always been a success.
Sanford, a grandson of the man who pro-
duced “Sanford’s Southern Version of Uncle
Tom’s Cabin” in Virginia, just before the
Civil War, in desperation produced the play
at the tail-end of his Sydney Lyceum season,
and found it the last nail in his co.’s coffin.
“R.K.D.N.”: . Australian audiences fre-
quently complain of sliort-weight plays;
America seems to like them. Galsworthy’s
“Escape,” now running at the Booth,
N’York, doesn’t start till 8.45, and with two
intervals —one of 12 minutes—concludes its
short, eventful history at 10.30.
“Set” : The much-worried British film pro-
ducer seems to be preparing to fight the
American menace by joining forces with it.
A British combine headed by Lord Beaver-
brook and others of much financial tonnage
has joined hands with the First National
and Stanley Co., of U.S.A., for the produc-
tion, distribution and exhibition of films in
the United Kingdom. Probably the British
restrictions concerning films made in the
Empire by firms with Empire affiliations and
employing a quota of British artists had
something to do with the big American com-
bine becoming interested.
DAME NELLIE—ADIEU.
[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
•‘Damg Nellie Melba has announced that she has
decided to go into the J. C. Williamson grand opera,
but as artistic director only.”
Dame Nellie—ah, do you remember
Those days that are written “of yore,”
When you said a farewell in December,
And in. March heard the echoed encore—
And said it once more?
Years many—ah, what does it matter
How long since you said the word first;
Since you wore “Farewell” down to a tatter
In your hundredth last lyrical burst—
Not bad at the worst!
’Tis envy, mere envy most bitter,
That rankles these folks who complain
That you, Nellie Dame, as a quitter
Come forward again and again—
And somehow remain:
And somehow remain to be bidding
Your hundredth decisive farewell—
Why, they say, ah, they say you are kidding;
That you’ll yet bring your larynx to swell
A penultimate yell!
Ah, Melba, it isn’t true, is it?
You’re through, are you not, with Good-
bye—
Your lips, they will never more kiss it
To stallites who strain for your sigh,
Or gods -upon high?
And if, now and then, you endow them
With another last concert or two,
’Twill but be, will it not, to allow them
To say, once or twice, their adieu—
Their farewell to you?

Totai Repair Cost £’40.0.0 ;
Read how Alemite Lubrication will prevent
costly repairs to your car
80% of repair bills have oeen traced to one
cause which you can now eliminate and at the
same time reduce the operating cost of your
car anywhere from a half-penny to a penny
half-penny a mile.
This cause is faulty lubrication of the dust-
exposed, hard working chassis bearings, and
faulty lubrication can come from an inefficient
system just as easily as from neglect.
Alemite Lubrication Easy
and Positive
This is why the Alemite High Pressure Lubri-
cation System is in use today on more than
10,000,000 motor cars. Why 93 out of every
100 American-made cars are equipped with it
before they leave the factories.
The- Alemite System is easy to use. All the
chassis bearings on a car can be lubricated in
a few minutes. And it means positive lubri-
cation. You always know that the lubricant
gets to the spot every time and stays there.
A small sum will equip your car
with Alemite
If your car is already equipped with the Ale-
mite System, use it every 500 miles. Lubricate
the bearings yourself or have your service
man do the work for you.
And if your car is not so equipped you can
have the System installed for a very small
amount of money. It merely means placing a
small, dust-proof Alemite fitting on each bear-
ing in place of the old-fashioned grease or oil cup.
How the System Works
The operation of the Alemite System is sim-
plicity itself. The handy Alemite compressor
gun containing the lubricant is attached to
the fitting on each bearing in turn. A twist of
the wrist forces clean, fresh lubricant en-
tirely through the bearing. Old, gritty grease
is forced out at the same time. That’s all there
is to it.
If your regular service man cannot supply you
with Alemite fittings or any of the other Ale-
mite Products shown at the left, write to any
of the distributors listed.

“After having been
treated at a I+ondon
hospital for some
considerable time
for dry eczema
on my legs, I
failed to get relief
until I used Rexona
Ointment, which, I
am pleased to say,
gave, me relief from

REXONA is Simply
Wonderful for Eczema!
What a plague Eczema is—it creeps on slowly, at first almost unnoticed, until it has a
hold, then it takes some moving.
Don’t give Eczema a chance, but at the first sign of the trouble apply Rexona, the Rapid
Healer. Eczema is easily amenable to treatment in its early stages. Later, if allowed to
run on unchecked, it will be a trouble hard to bear. Intelligent treatment with Rexona will
always get the best of Eczema. Rexona promptly allays the irritation and itching, taking
away the desire to scratch the parts affected. Rexona quickly dries up any pus or exuding
matter, and eases the ache and pain.
Rexona promptly destroys all dangerous
germs and bacteria, for it is a germicide of
the highest order.
At the same time Rexona builds up new
skin tissues and cells, so that in the end a
new and perfect skin is formed where the
disease formerly existed.
There is no better treatment for Eczema
than cleanly dressings with Rexona, the
Rapid Healer. You will notice the improve-
ment in only a few days, and persistent treat-
ment will always bring its reward.

The Soldier.
[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
HE throws himself down on a grassy hill
Beside the road. About, his soldier
mates
Are smoking, laughing, swearing, sitting still,
Listening, whilst a little one relates
A bawdy tale—a care-free, happy band
Of gallant soldiers from a far-off land.
They laugh and curse the while to the dark
north,
Beyond the meadows green that peaceful
lie,
Beyond the hazy hills, great guns drive forth
Their hellish death-bolts through a riven
sky.
And on the road that stretches out before
Moves every instrument of modern war.
They laugh and curse. Like healthy dogs
are they,
Splendid and boisterous, that roll and bite
On a white sea-beach on a summer’s day,
And rush destroying waves in sheer de-
light.
Careless are they of what the Past's brought
forth,
Or what awaits a day’s march to the north.
And he has learnt to love them, small and
great,
And they have taken him into their ranks,
Tried him, accepted him ; they call him mate,
And for that little thing his God he thanks.
But is he one of them? He can’t forget
He’s something more. He loves them all, and
—yet?
They call him mate, and laugh and curse and
jest,
And look at him great-hearted, friendly-
eyed.
They know not of that being unconfessed
That all his days he strives so hard to hide,
Else they would know, these men, just what
it is,
That feared and fearful inner self of his.
A poor death-haunted thing where all are
brave,
A living lie he moves amongst them all;
He fears War’s bloody wounds and gaping
grave.
His thoughts by day and dreams by night
forestall
Its promised hell. And he is sore afraid
The Lie will leap from out the part he’s
played.
Fear of a fear! ’Tis strange that God should
use
That coward self to drive him by the way
These brave and splendid men alone would
choose.
Yet as he robbed the orchard on that day
So long ago to hide a fear he bore,
So now to hide a fear he marched to war.
They laugh and curse. He loves them,
small and great,
Those men who’ve taken him into their
ranks,
Tried him, accepted him, and call him mate—
For that one little thing his God he thanks.
But is he one of them? He can’t forget.
He loves them greatly one and all, and —yet?
A whistle blows. He rises, takes his pack,
And falls in once again to march away—
Helmet of steel, slung rifle, haversack —
A khaki one of many. But that grey
Bidden self within stares wildly forth
At the dull, sullen thunder to the north!
VICTORIA.
ALAN D. MICKLE.
The Rendezvous.
[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
FOR a man of fifty it is a perilous thing
to re-discover his youth. He had not
deliberately changed his route on his
journey through New Zealand to take in the
cathedral city of Christchurch ; the business
that this prosperous merchant might have to
do in the sleepy little town was, compared
with his more important work in Wellington,
almost negligible. Yet he had determined, on
his flying transit to the warmer north, to
put in at least one day in which he hoped to
rake among the vestiges of that almost-for-
gotten youth, to see what had survived in
his memories. For there he had been to
school, and there he had learnt to swim in
the upper reaches of the then pellucid Avon.
So this plump, though well-set-up gentle-
man set eagerly forth upon his pilgrimage
of faded memories. The city seemed to have
retained its shape, though it had spread over
the Cassmere Hills, and the straight roads
reached to the distant, plains. Instinctively
he set forth towards the Avon’s gr.een banks;
he found new, beautiful bridges spanning a
stream no longer clear. He turned a corner
and his youth leaped up to greet him. There
was the old Normal School in which he had
spent his earliest years. He felt himself
a trespasser as he peeped into the playing-
grounds and glimpsed the tin-roofed gym-
nasium—and felt his elbow. He had fallen
once upon the tan —-he still felt the tinges
in his arm, but no! it was rheumatism.
He crept guiltily away, and saw the square
in which he had played cricket. But how
the trees had grown up since those idyllic
days! How vividly he remembered that
strange episode of a horrible man chasing
two boys in the twilight along the river-
bank. Inexplicable it was to him and his
younger brother, with that terrible Fear
sleuthing them—for no cause. Youth has its
incredible terrors.
For a moment he felt a tremor through
him; but he shook that horror off, and
orientating himself set forth at a brisk walk
to re-discover the house on Park-terrace
in which he, then a schoolboy, had lived
with his parents. He gazed carefully at
each residence as he passed ; but everything
had changed. Suddenly a number flashed
into his mind. Number 78! That was the
number on the white picket-fence, which he
had once painfully painted. But only the
number remained. The house, however, con-
veyed no memories. He laughed. The whole
terrace had been re-numbered. Be went in,
sure that his memories had not failed him.
The owner of the big house told him that
No. 78 had been burnt down many years
ago. The years had obliterated his youth.
Having paid his tribute to the past the
prosperous merchant straightened up, and
with a brisk step made his way to the
Botanical Gardens. He did not potter about
the carpet of tulips and the glory of the
flowering cherries and the massed azaleas
and the dusty gold of the kowhai-trees strew-
ing the ground. Hardly looking up he con-
fidently set his steps towards a mound
whereon grew a little grove of tall pines.
Ah ! he remembered that pine grove. The
picture of that group of huge boles and
dark foliage snapped back suddenly into his
mind. Yes, there it was; there it had always
been throughout his youth and his thirty
years of forgetfulness.
He stopped. He had been walking so
quickly that he felt almost faint. Blood
pressure! His doctor had often warned him.
He looked around, and found a convenient
garden-seat. Better be careful —he was no
longer young.
He shut his eyes in the face of the bril-
liant sunlight; and then he remembered. He
felt himself borne back to his childhood days.
He pictured himself lying on his back in
Hagley Park, with his eyelids closed against
the ball of the sun. And there the boy of
forty years ago had noticed, with the curi-
osity of youth a set of markings on his eye-
balls. It was an array of black spots, curi-
ously resembling a black constellation of
dark stars, with a crooked winding streak
running through the tiny dots. All through
his life that defect in his eyesight had re-
mained unaltered. Everything else in his
body had altered; but that sign-mark had
endured without a change. It w r as a special
secret brand, a concealed sign, an invisible
hall-mark of his individuality. Other persons
had, perhaps, a similar identity mark; but
none knew that individual arrangement of
dots and a streak running like a river
through tbs unvarying stars. He had been
born with that curious marking on liis eye-
ball ; it persisted still, and would remain till
there was no sight in his dying eyes. It
might be the last evidence of his life.
He hurriedly opened his eyes; yes, the
world was still around him, rich with color
and full of life. He was himself. Yet how
far away he had strayed from his ambitions.
For in those distant years he had been a
poet; his one ambition had been to write
poetry, to give to the world anew vision of
beauty and grace. Strange that his life
had been deflected from his ambitions ; here
he was now merely a prosperous ‘business
man. How had it happened? How much
he had missed he did not know in his busi-
ness career; but he felt —this tubby, middle-
aged man—that he had strayed into a dismal
and desolate path. What did business mean
to him? Yet he had made money and a
success in his drab career. Pie had failed
somehow, somewhere. The poet had died in
him —and he had let him die.
Sharp and distinct as a picture came a
distant memory from his boyhood. He had
gone on a holiday trip from Wellington to
Christchurch. How old had he been then?
It was hard to cast back for the date. Yet
he must have been just 21. In the little
Union Steamship vessel he had eagerly
scanned the passengers, especially the girls
on board. Adventure here, perhaps? Pass-
ing up the gangway he had glanced covertly
at a row of girls clustered about the steps.
They were just girls, chattering and laugh-
ing ; but suddenly he caught a strangely
elusive glance at him, and looked away. The
others did not interest him. Instantly she
attracted him. He contrived to pass down
the gangway, and, strangely excited, had
averted his gaze as he passed. Yet in that
moment there was born a sudden seclusion ;
he and the girl had passed, as it were,
through a magic portal; and the door of
the dull commonplace world had slid silently
behind them.
He went down to dinner with his heart
leaping. After the meal he would keep the
secret tryst that had been born in that magic
minute. Pie would find her waiting for
him ; and there would have been no explana-
tions to make: they were already initiates
in love. Yet when he anxiously looked
over the passengers —he had not seen her at
dinner, a dinner that he had hurried
through—he could not find her. Yet that
girl had passed him the sign of comrade-
ship—of something more intimate. He and
she did not need any formal introduction.
Youth is always an introduction. He
searched the ship; she was not to be found.
He spent the night in fitful sleep; Fate had
tricked him, as she always did.
He woke from his fever of exasperation
almost before the dawn. The boat was
approaching Lyttelton; the trip was over.
The world was dead. They would never
meet again.
He was standing gloomily watching the
vessel approach the bleak little wharf. A
touch on his shoulder made him swing
round.
It was she.
The poet could not speak. Love runs so
fiercely through the veins of youth that the
tongue is tied.
She hovered beside him, elusive, but with
her love to give.
There was no need for explanations. Boy
and girl alone they saw in the dawn of the
day the dawn of love.
“I was so silly,” said the girl. ‘T didn’t
come on deck again. I couldn’t. Fancy, I
was sea-sick! But I meant to meet you.
You knew, didn’t yo,u?”
Youth is direct and straight like that.
There is no need of explanations when every
girl is to be loved and every boy loves.
He laughed. It had never occurred to him
that a strange elusive thing like this girl
could become sea-sick. The world has a
sardonic humor.
The bleak dawn enveloped these two. No
one saw him draw the girl swiftly to him
and kiss her. She swayed into his arms.
The rim of the hills was bronzed by the
sun. For a moment he shut his eyes, and
clear and sharp he saw the array of black
dots before his eyes. The deck was deserted
behind a heap of deck cargo. The two
owned the world. Then they were no longer
alone. A deckhand approached.

INSECT BITES. —“An insect
bit me on the leg and the sore
place became swollen, inflamed
and ulcerated. After trying
several preparations that proved
useless I was recommended to
get Zam-JBuk. The first appli-
cation brought ease. Inflamma-
tion subsided and all poisonous
matter was quickly drawn out
of the skin by Zam-Buk. It
healed perfectly.”—Miss
Fulton. 215 Caxton Street, Bris-
bane.
SUNBURNT SKIN— My
summer pastime is swimming,
and' my back got badly sun-
burnt. The skin was so very
sore and tender I suffered
severely. I always keep Zam-
Buk in the house, so I had the
balm applied to my back night
and morning. Zam-Buk quickly
allayed the irritation and took
the heat right out.”-—Mrs.
Haines, of 389 King Street,

“You’re going to Christchurch?” the youth
eagerly asked.
. “Yes. Where can we meet again?” she
insisted. “I live there.”
‘I have to go on to Dunedin to-night,” he
said. "I don t know where we could meet.”
The girl kney. She took the initiative.
“Meet me in the Botanical Gardens.
I here’s a clump of pine-trees. You can’t
nuss them. I’ll be waiting for you there
at three this afternoon.”
The passengers were filing down the
gangway. The Lyttelton train w T as almost
due to start. There was no time for further
talk.
The boy absurdly hoped that there might
be opportunity to kiss her in the tunnel.
At the Christchurch railway station the
girl was met by her aunt. He raised his
hat; that was all.
How keenly he had anticipated the meet-
ing! Ah, thought the man of 50, remem-
bering the agonies and the trepidations as
he entered the Botanical Gardens. Suppose
he could not find the right group of trees?
But, no, there was that sheltering grove.
There could be no mistake. He strode con-
fidently to the trees. In the life of this
man of 50 he had had many such meetings.
Life provides opportunities for the young;
but it was many years since he had antici-
pated such an encounter. He was 50 years
old, and where was that girl of his past
now ? . No matter, he would revive the
memories of that meeting of long ago.
The man of 50 turned into the shade of
the group of pines. But he hurriedly drew
back. In the shelter of shadow a girl and
a boy were embracing! The past had
swung back to his youth. His place had
been usurped by another generation. He
had forgotten even the color of the hair of
the girl of his past. But the girl in the
shade was wearing short skirts and her hair
was shingled. The man of 50, shamefaced
and feeling foolish, saw himself as an old
fool, worn out and useless. What girl
would kiss him now? Better get about his
paltry business at once, with a memory now
utterly destroyed. What a pity that he
had wiped out that long-cherished romance!
Those youthful intruders had killed his past.
Well, that was that. Now he could do his
business in Christchurch, free from this
middle-aged foolishness.
Silly old fool—as if the past ever re-
turned !
And as he left the grove of dark pines he
idly noted a funny old woman making her
way to the clump of trees, with purpose in
her steps, not noticing the beauty of the
azaleas and the flowering cherry-trees.
He looked idly back. The old woman
stopped beneath the shade of the pines, but
she drew back, finding the grove already
occupied. She hovered there for a few
minutes, and emerged from the shadow of
the pines; then with steady steps she made
her way back to the entrance of the
Gardens and disappeared through the gates.
The man of 50 wondered w T hat had
brought such an old woman to that rendez-
vous that afternoon.
ARTHUR H. ADAMS.
The Hill of Repentance.
[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
[This is the second of Mr. Stedman’s stories of
life in Thibet.]
NORBO had refilled the little cups con-
taining meat, milk and tea and placed
them before the image of Buddha ; had
poured some of the contents of his own cup
into the fire and scattered pieces of meat to
the four winds as a daily offering to the
gods, and thus had performed the rites as the
Law decrees. Later we sat in the sun
outside the urta smoking the pipe of peace.
Before our eyes spread the treeless steppes,
with sheep and cattle grazing peacefully,
and on the far horizon rose the famous Hill
of Repentance, with its summit hidden by
the clouds.
“Will you accompany me to yonder hill?”
I asked Norbo.
After some slight hesitation he shook his
head. “It pains me to refuse a service,”
he said, “but I cannot go thither. No Mon-
gc’. ever approached this hill since the time
of Darja.”
“And who was Darja?” I asked.
“I know the story only as my father told
it to me, and as his father told it to him,”
he answ r ered.
“Tell me,” I begged; and Norbo began
his tale.
* * * *
It happened many years ago, long before
any Mongol ever knew the taste of bread.
There lived a wealthy man called Djigmit the
Pious. His sheep, horses and cattle were
beyond counting and his goodness beyond
comparison. From distant ulus people came
to him to ask for help and advice, and never
departed without obtaining what they re-
quired. And Burchan blessed him with
many sons, but the best of them all was
Darja, the son of Djigmit’s first wife.
From early childhood Darja was destined
to become a lama and serve the gods. So
when he was five years old Djigmit sent
him away from home to be brought up
amongst the teachers and taught to read the
sacred pages and foretell the destinies of
men. And when he had attained the age
of twelve his fame had already travelled
beyond the walls of his school, and people
flocked to him to get his blessing and advice.
They brought with them the clean, dry shoul-
der-bones of mutton, well burned in the fires,
and by the cracks and marks upon them he
read their future. No Mongol undertook a
long journey without' consulting him; no
man took a wife. without his advice. And
the school in which he lived amassed great
wealth, and there was no happier man in the
whole land than Djigmit, for the goodness
of a son brings honor upon the father.
When Darja reached manhood his father
built him a home near the school, where he
could spend his time in prayer and contem-
plation, and wherein he could dwell in peace
and do good. Old Djigmit also gave a great
feast in honor of his son, and for many miles
around no human being remained at home;
men, women and children came to partake
of the good things provided for the occasion,
for they all knew of Djigmit’s generosity.
Darja was present, and distributed gracious
words and blessings.
It was on the second day of the feast, late
in the afternoon, and Darja was riding his
horse, and his mind was on divine things.
He became so immersed in his thoughts that
he forgot about everything else, and was
suddenly surprised to hear the merry laugh-
ter of a woman.
She was young and strong, her dress was
of silk and her slippers richly embroidered.
A small basket was strapped on her back,
and the pointed stick in her hand betokened
the gatherer of argal for the fires.
“Who art thou?” asked Darja.
“I am grieved to think that Darja does not
know the wife of his father,” answered the
woman.
“My father’s wife!” repeated Darja.
“Thou art very young.”
“Yes, and does not Darja admire his
father’s taste?” she laughed.
Darja picked up the reins; but just then
the woman burst into tears. Now Darja
was not skilled in the ways of women. Dis-
mounting and approaching the woman he
questioned her of the cause of her sorrow.
She lay her head on his breast, and he
comforted her while she cried.
“Yet a few days ago I was happy,” she
said. “I thought myself God’s favorite to
be the wife of Djigmit; but now I am
unhappy, for I have seen Darja, the son of
Djigmit.”
“Cease thy foolish talk!” commanded
Darja. “Dost thou not know I am a lama?”
“Darja is a lama, even a great lama,”
spoke the woman; “but is not Darja also a
man?”
“I am a servant of God,” replied Darja,
“and if thou needest help I shall give it
thee.”
“Yes, help I need. Let Darja help me to
be happy. Does Darja not see I am young
and his father is old?”
She threw off her basket and stood before
him the incarnation of the temptress, her
breast rising high and her eyes flashing fires
of desire.
And something new, heretofore unknown,
stirred within the man’s breast, a vague
feeling akin to hunger, a strange desire to
touch her hand, to feel that heaving bosom.
Hastily he began to count the rosaries,
his lips repeating his prayers.
But the woman noticed his confusion and
spoke again : “Darja is a man, yet he must
not shoot a fox; a great man, yet must
not kill a sheep; a clever man, yet must
not embrace a woman!”
Her mocking laughter rolled along the
open steppes and reached within the heart
of Darja.
“True,” thought Darja, “I must not do
any of these things because I am a lama!”
“Behold, Darja,” cried the woman pas-
sionately, “the wolf has a mate and the
crow a companion, yet thou hast none!”
The woman, speaking words that were
new to him, put disturbing thoughts into his
head. He felt troubled; and then he knew
that his longing was for this woman whn
was his father’s wife. woman wao
Like a thief he ran to his horse, and the
sweet voice of the woman ran after him.
“I shall remain here, Darja. I shall wait
for thee in the moonlight. Even as thou
countest thy rosaries I shall count the stars
I shall wait for Darja the man!”
Like the wind of the steppes flew his horse
on and on, still urged by the rider. But
the voice followed him like an evil spirit
and her words rang in his ears: “I shall
wait for thee in the moonlight.” But his
lips continued praying and his fingers moved
the beads.
The sun had long disappeared behind a
hillock and the complete silence of the
approaching night was disturbed only by the
clatter of hoofs. And suddenly Darja realised
that his unguided hors.e had brought him
back to the starting-point, and the voice of
the woman greeted him: “I knew Darja
would come, for he is wise and generous and
brave.”
In his heart Darja felt that this was a
test, and should he be weak at this moment
he would be lost; yet had he no strength
to flee. His mind spoke with one voice but
his heart spoke with another, and the voice
of the mind was silenced by the whispers of
the woman. He submitted to the command
of his flesh, drank out of the cup of pleasure
what seemed sweet wine, but was poison to
his life; reposed in her soft arms and found
them serpents that twined around his heart.
When the desire of the flesh was satisfied
and the mind was again supreme—for such
is the struggle between these two, and the
man is but a toy, now for one and again for
the other—lie clearly saw his terrible
offence; he a lama had committed the great
sin with the wife of his father!
And thus old Djigmit found them just
before dawn —old Djigmit who, troubled by
the long absence of his son, had gone in
search of him, expecting to find him engaged
in prayer.
What happened in the urta when Darja
returned with his father was never told;
but that evening Djigmit was seen riding
into the hills, his young wife accompanying
him, and several days later Djigmit returned
alone.
Thereafter Darja was not seen alive by
human eyes. On yonder hill he found a
hole in which foxes dwelt, and there he
lived, spending his days in prayer and re-
pentance, nor spoke word again to his kind.
Only in the dark nights he came out of the
hole to take the meat and water left at the
foot of the hill by charitable people. And
when he died his wasted body lay outside
the hole untouched by beasts, for so great
was his sin that a lifetime of repentance
was not sufficient to expiate it.
And in the cold days of winter, when the
wind pierces one to the bone and man and
beast seek shelter from the bitter frost, a
heart-rending moan is heard issuing from
the hole on the Hill of Repentance. It
is the voices of the man and the woman who
had broken the Law, and who are for ever
pleading for forgiveness.
