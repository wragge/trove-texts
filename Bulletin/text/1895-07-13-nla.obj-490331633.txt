listed.
A Saint, and other tales, by Paul Bourget.
The “other tales” are “A Gambler,”
“Two Little Boys,” and “Childhood
Perfidy”—all characteristic of the author’s
limpid method.
The Crime of Sylvestre Bonnard, by Anatole
France.
Dame Care, by Hermann Sudermann.
The House by the Medlar-Tree, by Giovanni
Verga.
Gallegher, and other stories, by Richard
Harding Davis.
Balaam and his Master, and other sketches
and stories, by Joel Chandler Harris.
*** With the doubtful exception of “The
Odd Number,” the stories in this series
are rather recommended by style and
sympathy than by plot or vivid interest.
Davis and Harris have considerable Ameri-
can vogue, justified by their drollery and
perception ; but the average reader finds
them tending to dullness. Verga, Suder-
maun, and Anatole France employ the
charm of simplicity, not the fascination of
strength and splendour. Bourget’s stories
are lilies, not roses of literature—unless it
be white moss-roses. De Maupassant’s
striking book can be recommended for
general purchase : the others require some
“ acquired taste,” some welcome of appre-
ciative culture. Paper, 3s. each.
Handy Language Books.
Asa language is alive it is as difficult
to bag as a cat: it slips through pen
and tongue as quicksilver slips through
your fingers. Yet, though no writer or
speaker can hope to be absolutely correct,
it is plain to everyone with eyes and ears
that some are more correct than others.
Within the last few years a tribe of little
handy-books has sprung up to point the
way to linguistic precision, and some of
them will repay purchase and study.
“How to Talk Correctly” (Bd.) quotes a
large number of common errors in speak-
ing and writing, and supplies corrections.
“Don’t,” a similar manual (Bd.), carries
censorship into the domain of manners,
and gives a large number of hints which it
is pleasant to approve without heeding.
“Just the Word Wanted” (Is. 2d.) is a
simple book of synonyms, easily come-at-
able.
“The Handy Guide to Correct Pronuncia-
tion ” (Is. 2d.) lists words commonly mis-
pronounced, and supplies the proper
pronunciation.
“ The Secretary’s Assistant ” (Is. 2d.) teaches
how to address letters correctly to C.M.G.’s
and others of touchy dignity and indignity.
“The Dictionary of Blunders” (Is. 2dQ sets
one right upon common errors of epithet
and phrase.
“Familiar English Quotations” (Is 2d) is a
vest-pocket book useful as far as it goes,
but going hardly far enough.
“Everybody’s Writing-Desk Book” (Is 3d)
is cordially recommended as the best of
the lot, covering nearly as much ground
as all the preceding together.
“Common Words Commonly Mispronouced”
(2s 4d) goes into the finer shades of pro-
nunciation, and appeals to professional
speakers rather than to the ordinary ama-
teur variety.
Tne Bronte Hovels.
In a neat and uniform pocket edition, in
half-cloth, clearly printed, the works of the
Bronte sisters and Mrs. Gaskell’s “Life”
(7 vols., posted for 12s. fid.), are one of the
best current investments in English litera-
ture. Single vols., Is lOd each, as under ;

COUGHS, GOLDS ON THE CHEST, BRON-
CHITIS AND ASTHMA RAPIDLY

Those who have taken this medicine are amazed
at its wonderful influence. Sufferers from any
form of bronchitis, distressing cough, difficulty of
breathing, hoarseness, pain or soreness in the

tion in the throat, and giving strength to the voice,
and it never allows a cough or asthma to become
chronic. No house should be without it, as, taken

and a complete cure is certain. .
“We the undersigned, have had occasion, toobtam

Very ill with bronchitis. My wife heard of your

it: he did so, and it was just as successful with
his children. You are at liberty to make wflat
use you like of this, as I consider your Bronchitis
Cure to be a boon that cannot be too widely
known ; in fact, I cannot speak too highly of it.
Yours very truly, ARTHUR G. JAMES,

for the approval of their fellow-men, and single them out

is place and pay. And in commercial life the same thing
occurs, and the same strong contrast between the few
disinterested friends of the people, and the many selfish
lookers after the big profits they would like to make, is

Soft White Hands
Shapely nails, an unblemished skin, and luxuriant
hair are produced by the Cuticura Reme-
dies when all others and the best skin doctors
fail. In the treatment of the simplest forms of facial
r blemishes, or the severest humors and diseases of the
skin and scalp, with loss of hair, even when complicated
with hereditary or scrofulous taints, they are equally suc-
cessful. Everything about them invites confidence. They
are absolutely pure, and may be used on the youngest
infant. They are agreeable to the most refined and sen-
sitive. They are speedy, economical, and unfailing;.
CUTICURA
f Remedies afford instant relief in the most
distressing of itching, burning, and scaly skin
diseases. They cleanse the scalp of dandruff,
scales, and crusts, cure itching humors, destroy
microscopic insects which feed on the hair, and
supply the roots with energy and nourishment. They
restore the pores to healthy action, and thus remove
the cause of pimples, blackheads, red, rough, and oily skin.
They heal rough, chapped, and fissured hands, with itching palms
and painful finger ends, and remove the cause of shapeless nails.

I smote Him, bub He pardoned me.
You others struck Him, too, as I,
His meekness set your passion free,
I stood apart and watched Him die;
He saw, and smiled, and pardoned me.
You change, you knaves, now He lies dead,
And see what then you could not see,
Call down His thunders on ray head ;
I hate Him, for He pardoned me 1
HESKETH.
AT EVENTIDE IT SHALL BE LIGHT.
[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
Is daylight fading, Margaret?
Are those the bells of eventide?
Does darkness gather in her neb
The stars that in the sunbeams hide?
The children’s voices, are they not
i Hushed in the garden’s dewy breath,
To whisper in some far-off spot
The simple things of love and death ?
Your hand is cold, my Margaret,
\oureyes are dim through stealthy tears;
An ! all my soul with grief is wet,
To know you not in all these years !
Sweet, now too late I see in vain,
Your heart was poured to shallow mould
That could not hold it —once again
Kiss me, and let me lie a-cold.

HUBERT CHURCH.
THE SONG OF THE DAMNED.
[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
March we along on a well-trodden track,
Hell in our front, and Remorse at our back !
Pain on each side of us,
Evil the pride of us,
Nowhere the virtue that none of us lack.
Innocence, purity, faith we have lost,
Satan’s our head, and we march in his host.
Where is the God whom they taught us to fear ?
We are too vile for Him ; He will not hear.
Knew we the way to Him
We would say nay to Him,
j There is no Being whom we would revere.
Naught we believe, for we know naught is true;
Thorns in the roses and death in the dew.
Harlots and murderers march in our van,
Thieves and adulterers, woman and man.
Lust is the whole of us,
Dead is the soul of us,
Death is marked out for us; laugh while we can 1
Sin is our portion and sin is our choice,
Foul is our lot, and in filth we rejoice.
Christ is a byword, religion a lie !
Nothing is left for us, only to die.
Life is all weariness,
Ashes and dreariness,
Yet we still cling to it : where should we fly ?
Low in the foreground the clouds blackly loom :
Heaven is not for us ; Hell is our doom.
Once we believed we would strive to the light,
Joined in the struggle to set the wrong right;
Strained at the tough of it,
Chafed on the rough of it —
All turned to failure ; we dropped from the fight.
No hope for man : he is evil and base.
Mired in the slough and fixed in his place.
Do what you may you can never do well;
All of Life’s pathways lead only to hell.
Cease then your dreaming now,
Vain is your scheming now,
Join in our throng that is surging pell-mell!
Choose the short road to the devil, and die;
You cannot flee from him ; why do you try?
Fools that are striving to reach to the good,
Aiming to conquer the tide of the blood !
Vanity, vanity !
Foul is humanity ;
Leap to sin’s stream while it rolls in the flood,
Grasp the bright coals ere they fade into coke;
Life is a comedy ; Death is a joke.
Join then with us in our pleasure and play,
Ceaseless hot thirst that we ever allay !
Fall with us, sin with us,
Groan with us, grin with us,
Follow the demons that point us the way,
Marching in line to a hell that is crammed,
Singing in chorus the Song of the Damned.
WYVIS.
TO THE BROWN HAWK.
[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
Stayed on thy buoyant wings and wide,
Adrift above the tree-tops there,
Thy keen eye roves the country side,
Thou brigand of the air.
With curve and dip and lift and sweep
Thou keepest patrol of the sky ;
Thy wheeling circles slowly creep
Down where the carrion lie.
0 keen to scent and fierce to smite—>
Not swifter doth the swallow pass—
The young quail quiver at the sight,
Under the yellow grass.
The lust of rapine all thy joy !
Thy creed, by mercy unalloyed,
To prey, to harass, to destroy—
And be thyself destroyed !
As God hath made thee so art thou
And shalt be whilst His laws endure ;
’Neath smiling lips and placid brow
Is Man more pure ?

METALLIC MUMMIES.
A leading French physician, t)r. Variot, has been demonstrating the possibility of
obtaining metallic mummies of our friends, which may be used either for street decoration
or for household purposes. These onr monts can be prepared in gold, silver, nickel, or
copper, according to fancy and the pocke* and should the idea be adopted there is a great
future for this new branch of electro-plating. To effect the metallising much elaborate
apparatus is required, and the body has to bo previously painted with nitrate of silver to
render it a good electrical conductor. It is stated that .by regulating the deposit all details
of conformation may be retained, while at the same time the image can be made of
suffic’°nt thickness to withstand external blows.
A LONG-FELT WANT.
a [?]razen image of Geo. Reid, for instance, set up in convenient place, would just now be a godsend for certain politicians to case their tempels upon.

SATURDAY, JULY 13, 1895.
Mixing the Issues.
Three weeks ago the N.S. W, Premier ap-
pealed to the country on the one clear-cut
issue of Upper House reform, and announced
that the 1895 election was to be fought to a
finish on the question of mending or ending
the nominee Chamber. It is interesting to
look back on that fresh and unsophisticated
statement of a few days back. The dissolu-
tion was solely because of the Council’s
obstruction. The one question before the
electors was to be whether the Council
should be allowed to any longer block the
way of the people’s representatives. if the
country sent the Reid Government back
with a triumphant majority, it was thereby
to be distinctly proved that it demanded
Upper House reform ; if the country failed
to send the Reid Government back with the
required majority, its failure was to signify
that it was not yet prepared for the pro-
posed change—that and nothing more. The
one thing that was especially clear was that
the election was to hinge entirely on the
question of the old,- obstructive nominees
and their removal. And seeing that, within
the last two weeks, all the old and some new
issues—Freetrade, Protection, Freetrade
with Federation, Protection with Federa-
tion, revenue tanffism, the deficiency, the
great borrowing problem, the State Bank,
Single-tax, Land Nationalisation, Land-tax
with or without exemptions, Income-tax
with or without exemptions, Local .Govern-
ment, Woman Suffrage, Prohibition with
compensation, ditto without compensation,
the Referendum, the question whether
Judge Wxndeyer shouldn’t be compelled to
resign, the cheap nigger problem, and many
others—have risen up once more, arid the
question of Upper House reform is already
almost forgotten, thb Premier’s pronounce-
ment reads now like an amusing fragment of
ancient history.
• * #
G. H. Reid’s promise to go to the con-
stituencies on the single question of the
nominee Chamber and the much-needed
repair thereof would have been practicable
if various things had happened, none of
which came to pass : (1) It was necessary
that G. H. Reid himself should really appeal
k> the country on this question only, but
instead of doing this he appealed, among
other things, on Federation, Foreign-trade
and the opening of the ports of New South
Wales to the shoddy and mungo of all
nations, on his £2,500,000 loan which is to
be floated in London, on his great project
for charging the ordinary road-and-bridge
expenditure to loan funds, on land and
income-tax, the referendum, the Dibbs
deficit, and several dozen other things.
Thus he himself knocked out his own
alleged appeal in one round. (2) It was
also necessary that all Foreign - traders
and other Government supporters should
be in favor of the reform of the
Council, and that all Protectionists and other
oppositionists should be against it. As it
happens, however, there is as large a pro-
portion of the one party in favor of
reform as there is of the other, and Upper
House reform looms as large on Dibbs’
programme as on Reid’s. Consequently,
the Opposition flatly refuses to oblige the
Premier by fighting him on the question,
despite |he fact that he has ordered it to
fight on this especial question and no other,
and if his opponents refuse to oppose him
where he tells them to, then the plan of
campaign drops through. Premier Reid’s
“appeal’’was based on the assumption that he
was to go to the country witli the amendment
of the Council as the principal plank of his
platform, and his opponents were to uo with
the maintenance of the present nominee
system in its entirety as their particular war-
whoop, and their failure to whoop as in-
structed upset the entire project at the vei’y
beginning. And (3) the plan of campaign
was further based on the assumption that
the country would forget the fiscal issue, the
endless liquor-question in all its aspects, the
Premiers deficit, which is now somewhat
over £1,000,000, his shameless “ fak-
ing of the public accounts, his abandon-
ment of the Local Government Bill, his
failure to make any attempt at retrenchment,,
and all the other things he has done or left
undone—simply because he requested it to
do so. Also, that, if it approved of Upper
House reform, it would therefore, as a
matter of course, cheerfully authorise him
to muddle the public accounts for three
years more, and express at the polls its
cordial approval of that and all the other
features nf his career. And further that his
opponents would drop all mention of these
matters and abstain from criticism thereon.
Under all these circumstances, the proposal
to definitely decide the question of reforming
the Council by an appeal to the electors
would have been possible—but not other-
wise,
• # *
As all the impossible circumstances on
which the Premier apparently relied failed
to happen, it follows that the corning elec-
tion will be a matter of confusion and mis-
cellaneous football “ scrum, ’ like every
other election under the Party Government
system. Nine-tenths of the people, The
Bulletin is convinced, badly want to do
something that will make the Upper- House
amenable to reason, and put an end to its-
ceaseless obstruction of every Democratic
measure which comes before it. There is
no means by which they can let it be known
whether Mr. Reid’s proposed measure of
amendment will suit their views, but as it is
at least a considerable move in the right
direction, it would probably meet with the
approval of a large majority. And if the
people could send the Government back to
office to carry this bill, with an assurance
that it would do nothing else in the mean-
time save attend to the routine work of
administration, and not be any more crooked
in its dealings with the public accounts than
it could help, and would appeal to the coun-
try again as soon as the Council Reform Bill
was passed, then all would be well. Under
these conditions it might, or again it might
not, be possible to run the election on this
one great issue, and to get some kind of a
definite mandate from the country. But
unfortunately, it is impossible to make any
such compact. If the Reid Ministry comes
back with the required majority it means
that New South Wales approves of all its
past doings, that it gives it full authority to
wreck local industries for the sake of a small
ring of importers, to create new obstructions
in the way of Federation, to leave the local
government question in oblivion, and to use
huge sums of borrowed money for revenue
purposes, and to do anything else it pleases
for the space of three years. In other words,
the country is invited to approve in advance
of anything and everything which the Reid
Ministry may do between now and July,
1898. And if it doesn’t care to do this, it
is invited to give a similar comprehensive
order to G. R. Dibbs, or somebody else.
Under these circumstances the present elec-
tion is just like any other election—in other
words, it is twin brother to chaos.
♦ * *
The moral of all this is that the pre-
sent political upheaval will prove nothing
in particular. If G- H. Reid comes back
with a solid majority, it may mean that the
country approves of his scheme of Council
reform, or of his fiscal policy, or of his
management of the finances, or of some of
his colleagues without necessarily approv-
ing of him, or that it has been bought
over by his recent promises of a vast
number of small public winks scattered all
over the land, or that it approves of two
or three of his measures and objects to
all the rest, or that it objects to all of
them but likes him personally, or that it
loathes him but loathes Dibbs still more, or
that he has been returned through an acci-
dental combination of the Public Service
and the Bible-in-schools party and tiie Pro-
hibition vote, or that the public-house and
land-tax interests stood by him, or any one
of several dozen other things. And if,
instead-,, G. R. Dibbs is returned, he may
come to office because of his Protectionist
principles or in spite of them, because the
nation approves”?) I; his particular scheme of
Council reform, because it thinks him a good
financier or because it thinks , that he is a
very bad one, only not quite so bad as his
opponent, because of his nigger-exclusion
policy, or for any other of a hundred
reasons or combinations of reasons. One
thing, however, that is absolutely certain is
that when the election is over no one will be
really certain about anything. Another is
that it is mere childish deception to profess,
as Premier Reid has done, to appeal to the
country on one clear-cut issue and to get a
verdict thereon If the Referendum were
established—the whole Referendum, and not
the fragmentary measure proposed by the
Government—then it could lie done by send-
ing the issue to the country by itself, but
when the Government and its whole policy
and all its past record goes to the electors
along with it, their attention is too much
distracted to decide anything.
w « •
There is one, and only one, definite ques-
tion on which a Government could go to the
country and get anything like a distinct
answer. It could appeal on the question of
establishing the Referendum, with a promise
that, as soon as it was established, the
country would be called upon to decide
by a direct vote upon Upper House re-
form, Protection or Foreign-trade, pro-
hibition, the abolition of foreign borrow-
ing, nigger and kanaka exclusion, a State
liquor monopoly, and the dozen or more
urgent problems which have accumulated
through the paralysis of the Legislature, and
w Inch even along series of elections brings very
little nearer to a settlement. By making the
decision of the referendum final for a period
of (say) five years, some semblance of a fixed
policy would be arrived at, and the com-
munity would get, in most matters, as good a
form of government as it deserved. Pending
the adoption of this business-like method—
which, seeing that politicians live and move
and have their salaries and pickings through
mixing the political issues, seems eminently
improbable— The Bulletin trusts, in a
general sort of way, that the present elec-
tion will turn out for the good of
New South Wales, without any definite
idea how that result is to be arrived at.
For politics, under the system of Govern-
ment by Contradiction, are an unreliable
science, and the unexpected generally hap-
pens, though not often enough to be counted
on with certainty. In a few weeks, how-
ever, some one will be returned to power
without knowing why he was sent there, and
the people who sent him will be equally
ignorant on the point, and will remain so.
And when he has been returned, whoever he
may be, his after conduct, it is safe to say,
will be a grievous disappointment, for among
the general confusion of issues the nation
never knows exactly what it required its
leader to do, and the fact that he doesn’t do
it makes him generally disliked after a short
trial. Therefore, the present discourse ends
very much where it began.
The Dean Commission.
Since The Bulletin went to press for last
issue the Dean Commission haspublished its
report, of which previously only the conclusion
was known. Dr. Sydney Jones and Dr.
Manning review the circumstances in a judg-
ment clear, moderate, and comprehensive.
They find, inter alia, that the theory on which
Dean’s conviction partly depended - that
strychnine and arsenic are mutually anti-
dotal poisons—is false, as fully demonstrated
by exhaustive experiments made at their re-
quest by that accomplished physiologist, Dr.
Charles Martin, of Sydnev Umversitv.
Here was one fallacy exploded. Dr. Jones and
Dr. Manning proceeded to explode others,
Carefully scrutinising the evidence in the light
of their medical knowledge, they came to the
conclusion that Mrs. Dean had net taken
strychnine at all; that she had taken arsenic,
but not at the times she inferred she had ; that
she had probably taken only one dose of arsenic;
am! that at least part of her evidence was un-
reliable. They commented on Mrs. Dean’s
“ peculiar conduct
(«) m repeatedly takin* food and other articles from
the hands of her husband, though in a condition, as she
admitu <l, to help herself, whilst believing, as she stated,
that he was poisoning her. ’
n S"
impeded cominuulcation.
(c) In refusing to have medical aid on Sunday, MarchS,
rl°;: UMt,il her hu ? b . a "d insisted, and
took,action without her consent, and in concealing all
information as to the cause of her illness from her medical
attendant, in whom she appears to have had confidence.
And, finally, they concluded that
The facts as shown are quite as compatible with the
hypothesis that Mrs. Dka.v, for reasons which we can
only surmise and hy methods of which she has cognisance,
administered the arsenic to herself nossihlv at the
prompting of her mother, and without any I,'tendon of
takinst a fatal dose—as that the poison was administered
to her by her husband, with intent to kill.
The statement that they had grave doubts
whether Dean poisoned his wife, and the
recommendation that he be released, followed
as a matter of course; aud Dean was released
accordingly.
» *
But the third commissioner, Mr. F. E. Rogers
Q. 0., disagreed in loto with his medical col-
leagues. His opinion was
. . . based on the short ground that, it set ms to me un-
reasonable to suppose that a girl on the threshold of life
(whatever may have been her early surroundings) would
risk her existence by taking a deadly irritant poison,
whether in one or more doses, for the purpose of bringing
a false charge against her husband.
Tliat is all there is to Mr. Rogers. He wisely
refrains from interpretation or amplification. It
has been suggested that Mr. Rogers, a barrister
practising before the Judge whose judicial
reputation the release of Dean has seamed
with yet another crack, would be so hampered
by social and legal influences as to have diffi-
culty in reaching an unbiassed verdict. That
suggestion, in fairness to the learned counsel,
cannot be accepted either as his explanation or
his excuse. We have to face the fact that a
jury which believed that strychnine was an
antidote to arsenic, which believed that Mrs.
Dean was a reliable witness, which be-
lieved that Mrs. Seymour bore only a
moderately-blemished character, which was
in ignorance of the grave suspicion now cast
on the evidence for the prosecution, j’et deli-
berated for 10 hours and 20 minutes, according
to the Judge’s notes, whether they should find
Dean guilty, and were only then brought to a
unanimous verdict by the Judge’s hint that a
recommendation to mercy could be added, and
by what they took as his veiled menace of im-
prisonment from Saturday night to Monday
morning. Air. Rogers, with the chief evi-
dence which supported the jury’s verdict
destroyed, comes to precisely the jury’s
conclusion ! Mr. Rogers, with the rea-
soned exposition of his colleagues’ views
before him, characterises their conclusion as
unreasonable ! And why ? Because of this
fact, or that proof ? Not at all ; the mind of Mr.
Rogers seems to move independently of facts or
proofs. He concludes that Dean poisoned Mrs.
Dean on the wholly a priori ground that no
girl on the threshold of life would risk her
existence by taking a deadly irritant poison for
the purpose of bringing a false charge against
her husband.
• • #
Thousands of “girls on the threshold of
life” (Mrs. Dean is a woman of 21) take
this “ deadly irritant poison ” every day of
their lives to improve their complexions.
Air. Rogers does not care. Other girls on the
threshold of life have committed crimes as
ingenious as that which Mr. Rogers declines to
attribute to Airs. Dean —and some of them had
no mothers. Air. Rogers does not care. Dr.
Sydney Jones is a first-class medical specialist
—he presumably knows what “a girl on the
threshold of life,” born of criminal parents,
brought up amid immoral surroundings, is
capable of. Dr. Manning has had a wide experi-
ence in the treatment of the insane and the
criminal—he presumably knows to what heights
or depths “a girl on the threshold of life”
may be moved lay hysteria, or strong passion,
or mental distress, or evil promptings, or some
or all of these influences combined. Mr.
Rogers does not care. Mr. Rogers— whose
experience as a criminal lawyer should surely
have taught him better—stands forward to
denounce the conclusion of these skilled
physicians as unreasonable. He understands
lovely woman ; he knows that she is
never guided by sudden impulse, always
by the reasons which appeal to a matine
Q.C. ; he is sure that peach cheeks and
soft eyes are the infallible index of a
soul as innocent as his own head ; he puts
himself in Mrs. Dean’s place, conceives himself
“a girl on the threshold of life”—coy, timor-
ous, alternating between giggle and blush—and
then, fascinated by the image be has conjured
up, asks himself would he risk his virgin exist-
ence to bring a false charge against his husband,
and answers triumphantly, for self and Mrs.
Dean, “ Never, Never!” There has been
nothing like it since Sergeant Buzfuz wept over
the iniquity of the monster that deceived Mrs.
Bardell.
PLAIN ENGLISH.
The Administration of Justice.
Says John Stuart Mill: “The goodness of
the administration of justice is in the compound
ratio of the men composing the tribunals, and
the worth of the public opinion which in-
fluences them.” The first of these factors is
almost a consequence of the second. Certainly,
a good Judge cannot be made but of bad
materials ; but a bad Judge may easily be made
out of good materials. To the making of a
good Judge a sane and active public opinion is
necessary. There is in the antiquated methods
of our courts of Jaw, in the brutality of many of
our statutes, in our unscientific treatment
of the problems of crime, in the almost
despotic power given to our Judges, in the
deference rightly paid them, a concurrence of
tendencies which, unless they are guarded
against, will make a weak Judge capricious and
a strong Judge tyrannical. Justice should not
run in grooves; but a Judge’s mind often be-
comes unconsciously moulded to the groove of
the law. He loses the sense of proportion, the
power of self-restraint. He loses that in-
estimable and indispensable gift, the judicial
faculty, the ability to see things clearly and to
see them whole. The flattery of his subordi-
nates seems to justify his despotism. He brow-
beats suitors, takes tits of prejudice, gives way
to gusts of passion. The kinks in his mind
show uppermost, the strong fibres relax and
weaken. His sympathy is blunted; he becomes
harsh and cruel; he tosses away his scales and
eagerly seizes his sword. Then his honor is
gone, and the honor of his office. From a
Judge he has degenerated into an executioner.
It is time he was removed from a bench which
he degrades, a dignity which he disgraces. It is
time for public op.nion to intervene. The spec-
tacle here sketched is indeed one happily rare
in Australasia. The administration of justice
is generally creditable both to “ the men who
compose our tribunals and to the public opinion
which influences or controls them.” But even in
Australasia there is sometimes met a Judge who
has proved unworthy of his judgeship. When
a Judge discards dignity and outrages decency
in his zeal as an accuser ; when his mind,
dominated by prejudice, distorts evidence into
truth or falsehood as it is given for one side or
the other ; when his anxiety for a conviction
impels him to change his ermine for the silk of


prosecuting counsel; when houses his physical
strength to force weaker men into submission,
the respect in which men hold his office to bully
a jury into agreement; then that Judge is not
a defence, hut a danger to the community. If
his conclusions are contradicted, his judgments
set aside, his foolish asseverations from the
bench rightly turned into a laughing-stock,
then it must be plain to all that the uses of
that Judge, as Judge, are ended. Let liiih
restore, and instantly, to his masters, the
public, the jewel of public justice which was
mistakenly entrusted to his keeping, and which
his hands have tarnished.
“ The Bulletin’s ” Betterment Bill.
Ex-Premier Dibbs suggests that in future no
.Stale railways should be constructed unless the
land required is given by the proprietors gratis.
This is a feeble and clumsy method of getting
at the Betterment system. First, it would
block railway construction in mapy cases. On
almost every line there would he found at least
one miserly land-owner who would refuse to
give the required strip of soil even if all the
other owners consented, his idea being that
they would combine to buy him out rather than
lose their railway altogether. And the result
would be, either that this solitary malcontent
would prevent the'construction of what was
■possibly a> much - needed work, or that he
would get “ compensation ” from his neigh-
bors, and thus levy a species of blackmail
upon them. Secondly, the proposal is wholly
inequitable. The man whose land was actually
required for the line would suffer, while the
man a few yards away, whose property was
quite as much enhanced in value, would
go free. In some cases the railway would take
the whole of a small property, and in that in-
stance the owner would get no benefit what-
ever, and would certainly deserve compensation
—at the expense of his neighbors who were
benefited—instead of being expected to sacri-
fice himself for the enrichment of the adjacent
Fat Man. And, thirdly, the proposed system,
while it would ask too much in some cases,
would exact far too little in others. There are
many instances where a large estate that, with-
out a railway, is of very small value, would
have many thousands of pounds added to its
selling-price in return for the surrender of a
strip of earth which, before the line was
r.uilt, would hardly realise £lOO. This is
altogether apart from the fact that many
other landholders would get a similar
advantage without even that infinitesimal
sacrifice. The ex-Premier’s suggestion is merely
another example of the tendency of incompetent
men to take the easiest way out of a difficulty
which is beyond their mental capacity. No
efficient Betterment Law can be built on such
short and simple principles. It requires, first
of all, a Land Tax, either for local or State pur-
poses, so that every inch of privately-owned
land shall have an official valuation put upon it.
Secondly, it should be enacted that this valua-
tion, with (say) 10 per cent, added for “dis-
turbance,” is to be the standard on which com-
pensation is allowed, and that improvements
should be paid for at cost-price less a fixed
percentage, fii the case of buildings and
fences, for depreciation. This would imme-
diately reduce .the, cost of “compensation ”
by probably 7 §■ per cent. Thirdly, a large
proportion, which might start at 50 and
go up to 75 or even more per cent., accord-
ing to the conditions of the country, should
he debited to the local property - holders
within the radius served by the line, and ap-
portioned among them according to their dis-
tance from a railway station. And, to avoid
the huge outlay on litigation which would
ensue under ordinary conditions, it should be
further enacted that all appeals against assess-
ments should be heard before a special court,
where the Crown would be represented by the
assessors who made the valuation, and where no
legal costs would be allowed —the decision of
the said Court to be absolutely final. This
arrangement would certainly not result in in-
variable justice, hut it would produce quite as
good justice as could be obtained by hiring six
immensely expensive barristers, and dragging
the case from court to court until it died
miserably of old age before the Judicial Com-
mittee of the Privy Council. Mathematically
exact justice can never he obtained except in
isolated cases. It is a substance that is unpro-
curable in large quantities, and all that man
can expect is to get as near it as he can in the
shortest and least expensive way available.
The Exemption Clause.
B. R. Wise’s organisation, the Freetrade, Land
and Reform League, appeals to the people of
N.S. Wales on the principle of land-tax with
no exemptions ; the Reid Freetrade-party advo-
cates land-tax with exemption up to £40.) or
£5OO. In this matter, the Wise party repre-
sents the theoretical, and the Reid party repre-
sents the practical aspect of things. The Wise
party is composed of people who don’t own any
land, who have constructed a beautiful gospel
by which land should hear the whole taxation
ot the country, so that lawyers and pawnbrokers
may'go comparatively I tee, and who point out
that because'land should he taxed, therefore, on
principles of abstract justice, all land should he
taxed alike. The case for the Reid party
is tiiat one great object of the land-tax is
to encourage small independent farmers, in place
of huge estate-owners collecting constantly-
increasing rents from a hard-driven race of
tenants, and “blewing” them abroad on the
Irish absentee principle. And the only way by
which the land-tax can he made to do this is
by exempting the small holder and talxing the
large one in a steadily-increasing rate according
to his size. Then he will have a direct incen-
tive to sell his land in small holdings, because
20 small properties with no tax upon them will
fetch more per acre than the same area as one
holding with a tax upon it. As a proof of the
urgent need for such an incentive, in New South
Wales, during the last 15 years, estates varying
from 16 to 200 acres have increased in number by
14 per cent., those from 200 to 400 acres have
increased by about 26 per cent., those from 400
to 1000 acres-have increased by nearly 50 per
cent., those from 1000 to 2000 acres by 105 per
cent., those from 2000 to 10,000 acres by 116 per
cent., and those above 10,000 acres by close on
100 per cent. In 1879, the estates under 200
acres represented one - twelfth of the total
alienated area of the province ; in 1894, they
represented less than one-twentieth. The area
held by the small farmers—the men with less
than 200 acres apiece—has remained almost
stationary in the past 15 years, while that of
the big estate-owners with more than 10,000
acres each has more than doubled, and that
of the estate-holders with from 1000 to 10,000
acres each has much more than doubled. Under
these alarming conditions a land-tax with
an exemption of (say) £5OO a tax
which will directly encourage the small
holder and seriously discourage the huge
estate-grabber—is essential, unless the latter
end of New South Wales is to be that of Ireland.
The academic hair-splitter can doubtless prove
that, in the interests of a certain abstract, far-
off kind of justice, all land holders should be
taxed alike, but in practice it is necessary to
deal with Things As They Are. And the
things that are just now are shown by the
above figures. Already nearly 5,000,000 acres
of the province are held by tenants who pay
rents to private landholders, so the squirearchy
has even now acquired a very solid hold on this
new country, and unless measures are taken for
its effectual discouragement there is every
reason to suppose that its expansion will be
continuous.
The Book and the Tote.
An “ Old Bookmaker ” writes to a Melbourne
paper re the alleged stupidity of the public in
expecting to get longer odds from a tote than
they can obtain from the hook-nosed philan-
thropist who carries a bag. Speaking for him-
self, this amusing creature regrets that he
hasn’t been a tote during the last 28 years.
Estimating his total receipts at “fully one
million sterling,” he says : “ At 8 per cent. I
should have therefore held £BO,OOO hack with
no risk of loss, beyond clerical, hotel, and rail-
way expenses, licences, &c., and how rich would
I he now !” This is a conundrum which The
Bulletin, for one, cannot answer; hut, judging
from the business and private expenditure of
any gaudy “bookie” who handles £35,000 a
year, we should think that he made twice 8 per
cent, on returns. Also, it is quite certain that
he doesn’t give half the money to public
charities, which is a virtue peculiar to the tote.
Anyway, the public are less concerned about
bookmakers’ warnings Than their own losses.
They have to part company with a lot more than
8 per cent, of their outlay— i.e., the average
punter who punts to the extent of £lOO per
annum finds himself more than £8 out on his
transactions. He is nearer £2B to the bad,
taking one season with another. And it is to
him a .matter of indifference whether Ikey
“ cops ” it all, or the knowing birds “ who get
their living by getting long odds outside” win
a portion of it from Ikey. Neither is he stirred
by “An Old Bookmaker’s” statement that
“ hooks could lay longer odds if owners would
try more.” Owners are not likely to try more
until the machine deprives them of the oppor-
tunity to profit by “running stiff,” and then
Ikey Mo may wade in and lay all the odds he
can bellow. Let him surpass the tote’s odds if
he can, but he can’t. The public will always go
w here they can obtain the best prices, and if
there were a glimmer of truth in this particular
Ikey’s contention that it is foolish to expect
satisfaction from the machine, or “ toy ” as he
calls it, they would discover their folly after a
month’s experience, and he, knowing the reve-
lation in store for them, wouldn’t be now writ-
ing letters to the newspapers. Experience
proves that the Book cannot hope to compete
against the Tote for the holiday investments of
punters on the course. They don’t want to get
their living by backing horses ; they merely
seek the luxury of an occasional flutter without
getting too much killed or wounded by profes-
sional “sportsmen.”
The Ballot in the Assembly.
“ Outis,” in Sydney Telegraph, suggests, as
the only effectual method of reforming the Aus-
tralian Parliaments, that open voting should he
abolished in divisions, and the secret ballot
introduced in its stead. The proposal is by no
means new, hut it is a very long time since
even the most rampant of Tory papers has
ventured to speak of it openly. The merits
which are claimed for it are somewhat obscure,
but there is every reason to believe that it
would be joyously accepted by the great mass
of politicians. Comparatively few politicians
are honest—partly because comparatively few
people in any walk of life are honest when there
is sufficient inducement to he otherwise, and
partly because the politician has more induce-
ment to be very far otherwise than most of liis
species. The existence of the average M.L. A.
is a constant struggle between his desire to
keep straight with the electors, who are
generally more or less democratic, so as
to make his calling and re-election sure, and
his longing to sell himself for a valuable
consideration to the Fat Man interest. And the
chief reason why he doesn’t sell himself to the
Eat Man interest much oflener than he does is
that the sale must be made openly, and his
name in the division-lists will he a ruinous
proof thereof to wreck him when next he has
to meet his constituents. The introduction of
the ballot, however, would enable him to keep
square with his constituents, and sell his
alleged principles at the same time. Under
that system almost every politician would be as
thoroughly democratic on the hustings as his
constituents could desire, and would till the
pages of Hansard with the purest and noblest
democratic sentiments, and would vote just
as his private interests directed. And when
fifty high-souled politicians demanded some
great reform in the interests of the country at
large, and only one actually recorded his vote
in its favor at the secret division, every one
of the fifty would go before his consti-
tuents to bewail the corruption of the other 49,
and each one would probably convince them
that he was the pure, snow-white, disinterested
patriot who comprised that lonesome minority.
As no one would ever know who it was that
went back on his professions, there would ho a
good time for the politician wbo is for sale un-
furnished, and every man would be a democrat
of the most soulful order, and yet the Fat Man
would flourish exceedingly, and the syndicate
which had a concession to engineer through the
House would prosper beyond measure. Also,
all the leading National Ass magnates would
get in on the Labor ticket. The proposal to
introduce the ballot in the Legislature is about
the thinnest device which Fat Man lias yet
invented. It is so thin that even he hardly
dares to suggest it openly, and only the un-
official “ Outis,” of the Telegraph, has the
effrontery to be its advocate.
Arthur Buck, who repeated the hackneyed
crime of slaying his mistress because she left
him for another fellow, was judicially butchered
in Melbourne last week in a manner which
evoked from tyro Sheriff M'Farland the
remark that the job was a “ magnificent exe-
cution.” In many respects the law’s victim
differed much from the ordinary variety of
assassin, who shuffles off to the accompani-
ment of much nauseous snuffle. The mur-
derer regarded his crime from a very sane
and logical standpoint. “Society,” he argued,
“ hangs a man if he kills a fellow-being.
I put myself in my present position with
full knowledge of what I was risking, and
lam quite satisfied to die. Therefore, please
don’t worry me in my last hours with a lot of
stuff that I never could understand.” Upon
the same grounds he forbade the reading of the
burial service—that final GoD-Save-the-Queeu
of all hangings —just as firmly as Marshall
Hall ignores the National Anathema at his
concerts. On the whole, The Bulletin regards
Buck as a model murderer and a credit to bis
class.
The Vic. Tariff Commission reported on th e
woollen industries without having tested
samples of the flannels and tweeds turned out
by the various mills. Therefore the debate on
said report was an eternal wrangle concerning
the genuineness, or otherwise, of samples
shown by private members in support of their
arguments. If the cotton stuff with a thin
woollen surface, alleged to be Victorian flannel,
is the actual product of local mills, the
Victorians need more protection against the
cold than they are getting from the flannel-
makers. On the other hand, if cheap imported
rubbish is falsely represented as the native
article, a prosecution of somebody is an urgent
necessity. Meanwhile the fact remains that
bogus flannels are one of the devil’s principal
devices for spreading lung - disease and
increasing the death - rate. The people’s
health is the last thing considered by
party Government. Now, if half-a-dozen rabid
Freetraders were empowered to visit the Vic.
mills and test samples of their goods on the
premises, whilst six ardent Protectionists tested
imported stuffs of similar weight and appear-
ance at the Flinders Lane warehouses, and the
results of the two lots of tests were compared,
Victoria would know what sort of legislation
was best for its health. The same with local
and imported spirits and beer, or any other
articles which bear upon the welfare of the
public liver or lungs—not to mention kidneys.
In its fatuous eagerness to justify any and every
act of the N.S. VV. Legislative Council, the
Australian Star actually furnishes excuses
for that body’s rejection of the Electoral
Act Amendment Bill, by which rejection a
number of male adults of the province,
variously estimated at from 6000 to 18,000,
were robbed of that franchise which the law
desired to confer upon them. The Star
attempts the argument that Premier Reid
appealed to the Cassar that elected him,
and that, therefore, the Council was
right in sending him to that particular
Cesar, and no other. To adopt any
such argument seriously the Star would re-
quire polling-places to be declared among the
habitats of the angels, in order that those
electors wbo have died since they were part of
“ Cesar” might record their votes. Also, to
obtain the votes of departed and disfranchised
electors ! But the Star was not serious, except
to the degree that it considered the disfranchise-
ment of some thousands of “matured youths and
shifting citizens ” only worth the flippant sneer
recognisable in the quoted phrase. As the
alleged Protectionist daily organ of Sydney,
the Star is probably the most baleful enemy
the N.S.W. Protectionist-party has to fight
against at the present time.
In its own stupid fashion the N.S.W. Council
did the country a great service by causing the
rejection of Premier Reid’s latest Loan Bill.
It had a chance to do itself a great service also,
but it lacked the necessary intelligence and let
the opportunity slip. It might have risen in a
burst of patriotic fervour and struck out all the
road and bridge and dredging and other un-
productive items (iff,ooo,ooo in all) from the
schedule, on the democratic ground that
these were ordinary items of current ex-
penditure and should be paid out of current
revenue, that previous Treasurers, had paid
them out of revenue, and that to do other- -
wise was sheer dishonesty. But instead
of this the Council feebly struck out
one or two very glaring items without assigning
any definite reason for its conduct ; it left out
the burst of patriotic fervor, and didn’t appeal
to the people as the defender of their interests
against a squinting Treasurer, and it struck no
dem icratic attitude whatever. Consequently,
Premier Reid dropped the Bill for this session
on the ground that a set of fuzzy-brained old
gentlemen had been meddling with if, and the
inherent sinfulness of the measure was never
brought before the public at all. Even the
most aggressive Tory could hardly make out a
good case for a House which so miserably fools
away its opportunities. The nominees had one
great chance to show that they were not quite
the iucapahles people take them for, and they
missed it for the sufficient reason that they did
not know enough to come in out of the wet.
Journalist James Smith read a dreadful paper
entitled “The Curse of Protection,” the other
evening. It was at Melbourne Democratic
Club, and a Madden, as usual, occupied the
chair. James Smith’s views on the Protection
v. hreetrade subject ace quite as valuable as his
opinions about anything outside of the heathen
mythology, and his arguments fully explain his
position as an Argus leader-writer of long
standing. That is to Say, the book-proud
ancient hasn’t a practical argument in
him. He prattles of the beauty of Freetrade
in encouraging manufactures in Hiugland,
and bewails the cussedness of Protection
in doing the same thing for Victoria.
“ History,” he says “ shows that Protec-
tion has been the curse of every country
upon which it has laid its blighting hand,”
whereas history shows nothing of the kind, and
the prosperity of Spain under the Saracens has
no bearing on the fiscal duties of to-day.
When the freetrading Saracens were ejected
the blighting hand of Spanish Jesuitism touched
the commerce of the country. Bigoted
Christians succeeded level-headed infidels and
. trade collapsed. History is valueless as a book
of reference for political economists. Its pre-
cedents are wildly conflicting. Some com-
munities have seemed to benefit by Freetrade,
others have fattened on Protection. But none
of them seriously attempted to build their
industries on Freetrade, even when there were
no steam marine services, ocean cables, and
railways to further the interests of the fat
importers and indenters. History reveals
merely the slow march of civilisation and the
frantic efforts of James Smiths to push it back,
and a long series of Maddens in the chair.
Hear the cry of Melb.’s chief Tory organ in its
agony! “Every country member who lends
himself to a high tariff duty helps on the heavy
land-tax cause. Mr. Turner will tell this
member that a revenue must be raised. And
it must come from the land if it does not come
from the Customs. And the bulk of the revenue
can come from the Customs without injury to
anyone by our approximating to the rule, ‘ the
lowestduty that will yield the largest revenue.
The “anyone” who couldn’t be injured by the
substitution of imports for local manufactures
is the importer, landowner, civil servant in a
sure billet, fashionable shopkeeper, or employe
of any firm that stands to gain by a sudden
abolition of high duties. A Freetrade policy
would serve the turn of all these, although it
would be rough on the main body of their descen-
dants. In the meantime, a good many thousands
of wage-earning producers in Victoria—for a
bootmaker is just as much a producer as a
buttermaker—would find their occupation gone,
and roam around seeking any sort of work,
and be compelled to take it at the lowest price
that yielded the largest revenue to capital.
But local manufacturing hands, and the working
men for whom Protection has distinct advan-
tages, are not “anyone” at all. They are
interested in the failure of Customs duties and
the success of the Land-tax principle, but they
are not “anybody” in the respectable sense of
the word, nor can they be injured in a Tory
manner of speaking.

For some time past negotiations, initiated by
the N.S. W. Justice Department, have been
proceeding between the various Australian pro-
vinces with a view to the uniform adoption of
the Bertillon and Gal ton systems of recidivi-de
(relapsed criminal) identification. The Ber-
tillon system is anthropometric, and records
the length-measurement of the subject’s head,
left middle finger, fore-arm, and foot, along
with the particulars, such as height, age, etc.,
taken under the existing method. The Galton
system consists solely in the record of finger-
prints—no two men’s finger-skin having the
same convolutions. Worked in conjunction,
and aided by full and profile photographs, it is
claimed that recidivistes can be classified in
groups of ten, thus making it possible
for them to be in a few minutes traced
and identified when they turn up again.
At present the Bertillon system is in operation
in France (where it is said to have led to the
general abandonment of aliases by criminals)
Argentina, Japan, Ceylon, Bengal, Russia,
Roumania, Norway, Switzerland, Paraguay,
and, lastly, in England. Yet, when the hum-
drum police and prison authorities of Victoria
came to report on the proposal to federally
adopt it in Australia, they loftily discounted
all that is claimed for it, and expressed the
view that the present crude methods are quite
good enough. The Bulletin , trusts that
Chief Secretary Peacock will not £ive a decisir n
on the question until he has independently
primed himself upon its important points.
The electric railway, or trolly, or aerial wire
system, as it is variously called, is coming sud-
denly to the front in the United States :
The development of electric railways in America is
heyinning to revolutionise travel, djiie steam railways
are finding it difficult to compete, with the electric trolly
lines over large parts of New England. ,An electric line
is also projected to connect Haverhill, fn Massaohusei is,
with Quebec, in Canada, a distance of “2SO miles. The
Cincinnati, Hamilton and Dayton Rahway. one of the
older American lines, is about to substitute electricity for
steam power. The competition of the electric trolly lines
has brought down the fares on the Philadelphia and
Reading, and is expected to do so on the Pennsylvania
railway; and, finally, the greatest project of all, the
Inter-Oceanic Electric Railway, has been incorporated in
Illinois with a capital of 200,000,000d01. It will construct
an elevated electric railway between Chicago and New
York, and finally from Chicago to the Pacific. American
engineers seem to be all agreed that steam railways are
doomed within a quarter of a century, so far as America
is concerned. . . The trolly laughs at embankments,
cuttings, tunnels, and bridges, and the men and machinery
required to make them. The blithe trolly sings along i s
delicate wires, dodging every obstacle, legal as well as
physical, and likewise dodging every expense. It began
as a humble servant of the suburbs yesterday. To-day
linesareprojectedandcapitalised between great cent res like
New York, Washington and Baltimore, and there is already
talk of a trans continental trolly. . . Railway companies
are looking on this hew system of traction with the feel-
ings entertained by an heirless landed proprietor for his
hostile next-of-kin. Loaded down by their vast burden
of charges and costly maintenance, there seems nothing
for them to do but wait patiently to he superseded.
The trolly is built in a night, lik an enchanted palace,
and at once begins to earn dividends —the dividends of
the railways. It is a system that appears specially
adapted for a land like this, where there are so inai y
difficulties in the way of the railway engineer.
Freetrade England pays little Denmark
£12,000 a day for butter. The. Danish fanners
understand combination and oo operation in dairy
matters, and are mostly their own landlords.
For butter, bacon, and eggs England pays the
same little, thrifty, astute nation 84 millions per
annum.

Sydney Lyceum co.’s second effort, “In
Town,” is a play that goes flying light in the
matter of plot. This gives it a distinct advantage
over the “Gaiety Girl,” which had some kind of
a story to carry, and consequently found itself
considerably encumbered, like a lone female with
a trunk at a remote railway-station. All the
same, The Bulletin's well-weighed opinion is
that the “Girl” was the more satisfying pro-
duction of the two. “In Town ”is a lot of gilded
nothing in a great hurry. It travels too fast to be
dreary, yet it is as ungraspable as a ghost that is.
doing 60 miles an hour. Its sole object is to get a
rather heavy duke and his son and daughter and
a stone-broke captain and the duke’s “old woman”'
into the green-room of a theatre, and it gets them
there with the intense vigor of Samson carrying
a penholder across the street. They are amusing
enough in a certain whirlsome fashion, but when
they suddenly remain at their destination about
10.45 p.m. the audience ought to feel glad that
they hadn’t to be conveyed any further. “In
Town ” is a pleasant picture of a world that
is all golden hair and legs, where captains live
without visible means of support, and giddy dukes,
lead a butterfly existence upon roses and lilies.
The fact that the real duke is frequently a stodgy
person who writes abysmal articles on protoplasm
in a quarterly magazine is happily forgotten.
m • •
Louis Bradfield, who had very little to do
with the “ Gaiety Girl,” is the whole show of “Ini
Town.” He is the lightest and airiest of insol-
vent captains, and the fact that he does the very
same piece of pantomime which was Lonnen’a
main support in “Faust” is graciously forgiven,
on the ground that he does it much better than
that overworked individual. Bradfield is a meteor
in a shiny top hat, and his business is to drive the
giddy little duke to destruction, and to dodge a
greenery-yallery wreck with a writ, and to beguile
a shocked chaplain into strange songs and dances,
and to swing by his tail from the branches of the
play generally. He does all these things in a joy-
fully irresponsible fashion that vaguely suggests a,
butterfly which isn’t quite right in the head, and
everything that he has to do is done well, even if it
isn’t worth doing. Bradfield is obviously going to.
be a favorite in Sydney. The rest of the company
are mere etceteras.

Miss Decima Moore’s adorable voice having
again been wrecked by a bad cold, her part,
which didn’t matter much after all, was taken on
Saturday by Miss Laura Kearney, who filled it in
a thoroughly competent fashion. Miss Florence
Lloyd (in pants) makes a truly elegant son and
heir to the giddy duke. That ducal personage is
played by Charles Ryley, and is a fine piece of
comedy, but there isn’t enough duke to seriously
attract the attention of the audience. Leedham
Bantock as Hopkins the chaplain ; and little
Fred. Kaye, with a brick in his pants for a dis-
guise, as a dishevelled call-boy ; are both highly
interesting, and are unduly crowded out by pres-
sure of Bradfield. Also, the Duchess of Muff-
shire and her lovely daughter (Miss Blanche
Massey is the daughter) fade away early in the
show and are thereafter seen only by casual
glimpses. There are fleeting visions, also, of a
number of other ladies who are seen now and then
when Bradfield is under a temporary eclipse. The
stupendous Fritz Rimma looms up at intervals,
but the still more stupendous Monkhonse is suffer-
ing from a well-chosen absence. “In Town ”is a
thing of such slender proportions that if Monk-
house leaned his vast proportions against it only
once it would break.
** * *
The Dacres and their “ Bunch of Violets ”
are being well - supported at Her Majesty’s
(Sydney), but not near so well as the excellence of
the play and the company (or most of it, anyhow)
deserve. Further inspection of Grundy’s drama
only strengthens the very high opinion The Bul-
letin formed of it last week; and Caere’s fallen
snutflebuster, who was excellent on his first
appearance, grows still more excellent on longer
acquaintance. The only touch of nature that is
missing is that the Boanerges Bank is not recon-
structed in the last act, the depositors taking 2J
per cent, extended deposit-receipts with a text
printed on the back. Frank Harcourt’s Federated
Son of Toil, and Sweeney’s red-headed brewer,
and Scot Inglis as the bony, insinuating secretary,
also merit a continuance of the public confidence
until Friday next. After that date it won’t be
required, as “Man and Woman” goes up on
Saturday.

The Kinetoscope has resumed business in
new premises opposite Sydney Lyceum, with a
fresh set of pictures which are as good in every
respect as the last collection. In place of the
skirt-dance there is Carmencita, the Spanish
dancer, who wears a rather brief costume and does
a fantastic performance on two most commendable
legs. This lady relies, however, on her arms for
the principal effect, the said arms being white and
shapely and full of expression. A most blood-
thirsty Mexican duel with knives, in which both
combatants survive, is a spectacle which beats the
Soudan Contingent badly for ferocity; and an
Indian war-dance, a Buffalo Bill shooting per-
formance, and a blacksmith's shop are also on ex-
hibition. Tub Bulletin respectfully suggests
that a chaste and refined dog-tight picture should
be added as a speciality for Saturday night.

Hamilton's circus was announced to open
at Redfern on Wednesday, and will be more fully
noticed next week. The stupendous person, Herr
Hajek, is on the list of performers, and it is under-
stood that he will hold out two ponies at arm’s
length, and will lift locwt. at once. Hajek does
these things not so much for a living as from force
■of habit. In his moments of abstraction he
frequently lifts up omnibuses and waves them
•absent-mindedly in the air, and it is quite a
•common thing with him to carry away large gum-
trees and anchors when he is thinking deeply
about something. A liberal offer has been made
■him to hold up a certain bank which will shortly
be much in need of support, but he declined it on
the ground that it would be a waste of energy on
ihis part to hold up less than two banks at once.
* * * #
Harry Rickards’ co., at Sydney Tivoli, is
■considerably strengthened by the advent of Miss
Isabel Webster, who is about as far removed
from the ordinary song-and-dauce artist as Sarah
Bernhardt herself. Messrs. Wadley and D’Eusem
likewise help to lend an air of refinement to the
programme, which is steadily getting further and
further away from the rather solemn rut of the old
style of variety.

The present bill at Sydney Empire is the
■best yet produced by the present 00. Miss Marie
Dunoon, a young and pretty vocalist who made a
meteoric appearance a year or two ago and earned
a good deal of admiration, now lends a very melo-
dious voice to the show ; and Mr. F. Wyatt, who
gets “A Hundred Fathoms Deep” every night,
seems fully capable of getting down to 1000
fathoms if wanted.
* * * *
The B. and B. barometer at Melbourne
Princess’s still reads “fair to middling.” Grundy’s
“New Woman” was rather more middling than
any previous production, and on Saturday the
management tried tire same author’s “ Sowing
the Wind,” a play affectionately remembered for
its pretty costumes and good moral teaching.
“Sowing the Wind” is severe upon the elderly
male ass who pretends to a knowledge of woman-
kind without having sought even one quarter’s
tuition in the school of matrimony. The story
leads up to the discovery by a cynical old bachelor
that he has blighted the life of iris crony with bad
advice, and his conscience smites him heavily in
the last round. The daughter of the spinster
whom this trusted adviser had maligned
turns up after many days to bring a foolish
father to his knees, whilst the wise old
reprobate of the piece, having explained every-
thing with a sealed packet, strolls away,
jaunty and impenitent, to reflect on the mis-
chievous stupidity of his respectable fellow-man.
These types of society wear beaver hats and
bottle-green coats of ancient design, but they are
as full of modern significance as Premier Reid’s
attack upon the N.S. W. Hupper ’Ouse.
♦ » *
Changes from the former cast of “ Sowing
the Wind ” are not for the better. Robert
Brough had naturally dry and chippy qualifica-
tions for the character of the shallow mentor, who
makes everybody miserable ; and Carey, although
a satisfactory successor, finishes several lengths
behind Brough. Also, Miss Talbot is not an ideal
Mrs. Fretwell, which Miss Romer certainly was ;
and Miss Faber, as the heroine, doesn’t suggest a
young woman, reared among giddy surround-
ings, who has taken to the lyric stage
and captured the town. Mrs. Brough, in
this part, acted like the actress she was imperson-
ating, whereas Miss Faber’s lack of staginess, in
appearance and style, makes her comparatively
ineffective. The one lady was somewhat too loud
in the powerful “sex against sex” scene, the
other is much too thoughtful and quiet. “Baby
Brabant’s” daughter, when her blood was up,
would surely be a more dramatic person than Miss
Faber makes her. Messrs. Titheradge, Bouci-
cault and Cecil Ward, are admirable as before.
Dorrmgton’s legs are valuable adjuncts, and Miss
Noble s maidenly giggle is now well under control.

On Saturday this clever company, rein-
forced by William Elton, will test the feeling of
Melbourne in a new direction. Serious comedy
has not been properly appreciated, and farcical
comedy*ts to get a show. The particular screamer
selected for tius occasion is “Thoroughbred,” now
running at ioole’s Theatre, and Elton appears in
the large, fat part written for J.L.T.

A timely rush of new artists to Melb.
Opera House has set the Rickards establishment
booming again. On Wednesday next, it is
announced, the remarkable Henry will produce
himself for a short season of five nights prio r to
his departure for Europe on another important
mission.
* * * *
“ A Million of Money,” at Melb. Royal, is
a rather more imposing spectacle than it used to
be at the Princess’s, when Myra Kemble figured
as the adventuress with the stormy past. The
Derby horses travel faster, and the crowd spreads
itself further in all directions, and the army is
less cramped for space. These are matters of
importance, because “A Million of Money” has
no murders or other bits of human interest to back
it up. The hero does nothing much beyond
“ blewing”' his undoubted wealth and making his
wife jealous with a cause. Neither is the wicked
Cosgrove any wickeder than ordinary men
who don’t go to church; and the" lovely
adventuress invites pity rather than scorn,
whilst her nnsober husband is open to doubt.
He comes forward and represents himself as a
badly used ruin, but the statement of any person
in a of liquor ought to be regarded with
suspicion. As far as the audience can form an
opinion he is an unsuitable husband for a lovely
woman, and his sudden decease seems to happen
all for the best. There is nothing in “A Million
of Money ” to excite particular joy or sorrow. The
unjustly-suspected plunger comes back to his un-
interesting wife; and the lovely adventuress
dies of starvation on a reef which would
seem to have some bearing upon her alleged
crimes if her second husband, a noble-minded
young man, didn’t share her awful fate. More-
over, it is not certain that either of them die.
The reef scene is an interpolated vision, as false
as Mrs. Mellon’s spooks, very likely. Whether
it is a legitimate item in the drama, or a mere
nightmare slung in for the sake of scenic effect,
there can be no doubt that it supplies a want, and
reflects credit on the scene-painter. “ A Million
of Money” will run and prosper until further
notice.

Dear BuUjßtix,— lie the alleged “quarrel ” between the
late Miss Violet Vailey and VV. and M. It takes two
parties to make a quarrel. The Firm gave the part of
Marton in “ La Cigale ” to Nellie Stewart (when she was,
for the first time, here to play It) because that first-class
artist was their one and only prima donna, and the result
amply justified the policy. Any parsing annoyance which
the other lady may have felt was not a tiling to be taken
seriously.— Ait Poou.
B.: “ Melbourne theatrical taste is sadly corrupted. In
five weeks we have had at tire Princess's this splendid
succession of plays: ‘The Case of Rebellions Susan,’ ‘An
Ideal Husband,' ‘The Masqueraders,’ ‘The New Woman,’
ami ‘Sowing the Wind ’ —two Grundy’s, two Jones’s, and
one Oscar Wilde ; result, the worst houses on record.
Down below ‘ The Union Jack * and ‘ The Fatal Card ’
have sufficed to coin money in the same time. The smell-
ful city should be left to feed on the Darrellolloway pano-
ramadrama for five years.”
II.: "The denunciation of the Gaieties by (Svdnev)

Writ sort, but his obvious mistake is going for the
Thespian instead of the audience; for the drama's laws
the drama's patrons give, as Coppin said when ‘re-
luctantly forced ’ to produce • Pink Dominoes. ’ Surely
Mr. Hill must perceive that kindly social treatment of the
theatricals tends to the improvement,of the stage, and
that the mischief is in fencing them off, making them
outlaws, in a manner. Critique Sarcey complains that
the young French actors and actresses are not so good as
they used to be, merely because they are virtuous men
and women, not Bohemians, and have been moulded by
correct society.”

Marshall Hall never commences a concert without
turning round on his conductor's pedestal and tapping
loudly on his music-stand with his baton as a signal for
late-comers to be seated quickly. The consequence of
this is that women who come in late, have the joy and
privilege of being looked at by everybody in the room.
This is being discovered by the vain. Just as a woman
with a new bonnet will hurry up the aisle of a church
just after the service has been commenced, knowing full
well that she will be on view to the greatest advantage,
so Melbourne women who have new hats and frocks are
learning that it is worth while going in a trifle late to a
Marshall Hall concert.

light, is legally forbidden to break in. It is a
cold time for the poor bailiff, and the July
westerly blows the clippings through "his whiskers
and agitates the fringe at the feet of his pants.
The staff is sealed up inside, and makes its
entrances and exits under midnight difficulties
(chiefly connected with hoisting gear), and with
an elaborate strategy which would do credit to an
autumn manoeuvre. But the paper comes out,
and the great heart of the proprietary is
still in the right place, despite its many
troubles. The other day, a well-known Sydney
pressman came round with a subscription-list on
behalf of a distressed brother of the guild, and the
beleaguered management, having luard his tale
from an upper window, promptly lowered a dona-
tion in a pannikin on the end of a string. Editor
Taylor would probably stand for Parliament at
the present election if it were not that so much of
his time is occupied in getting out and in that
there is very little left for politics. If some
modus vivendi could be arranged with the
plaintiff, the lengthy and talented journalist
might yet be able to come forward and save
his bleeding country. The Bulletin urges, the
plaintiff to consider this matter. It seems calami-
tous irony that so bright an intellect should be lost
through a mere sordid difficulty with a bailiff.
The latter person, too, is rapidly deteriorating
through exposure in the lane, and may presently
become useless through rheurnatiz. This paper
would, therefore, suggest, as the basis for a better
understanding, that he should be withdrawn on
condition that editor Taylor stands for Parlia-
ment, that gentleman pledging himself to admit
the minion of the law if he is returned.
If he isn’t returned, then the siege can
be resumed at the end of this month
under less inclement conditions. The present
mode of carrying on hostilities is an act of bowel-
less cruelty to the bailiff, an innocent third party,
ftho may, for all that is known to the contrary,
be a widower with a large-family. During the
siege there have been in the office one fire and two
epileptic fits ; also, editor Taylor, the other day,
sang out to the bailiffs: “ Hey, there ! Is there
anyone in your crowd named Buckley ?’* (A. G.
Taylor had heard there was). “ Yes,” cried one
of the baffled bailiffs, hopefully, thinking the
question a sign of surrender; ■**“ yes, why?”
“Well, you’ve got ‘Buckley’s chance’ of
getting in here, if you hang around for a
century!” Then there was grinding of
teeth. A full supply of groceries has been
hoisted to the upper windows ; likewise seven
bedsteads have been passed in piecemeal through
the iron-bars (bailiffs can’t legally seize anything
which is being passed into a beleaguered build-
ing), and the top skylight has been secured with
barbed wire. The object of the defence, it may
be stated, is to retain possession of the plant
(leased months ago by the conductors of Truth
from libel-defendant Willis) until the Supreme
Court shall have decided an interpleader-action.
And, finally, it is 40 to 1 that the plant, when
finally seized and auctioned, won’t fetch enough to
pay the costs of the siege, to say nothing of the
original libel-verdict and costs.

Interest on Australasian national debt on 81st
Dec., ’93 (Coghlan), £8,300,667. Value of Australasian
gold-yield (1894), 2,020,1800 z. fine at £4 55., £8.685.765.
Concerning the N.S.W. loan of £2,500,000,
which is temporarily suspended but is to reappear after
the election, Premier Retd states distinctly that there is
no present intention of raising the amount in the pro-
vince, so presumably the London market is to he again
resorted to. The Government stock already on the local
market is being eagerly bought in Sydney at prices
which yield the investor only £3 7s. Bd. per cent., and it
is absolutely certain that a 3J per cent, loan for 2J
millions would go off readily at par, especially if it was
sold piecemeal after the fashion adopted by ex-Treasurer
See. A Sydney banker recently said to The Bulletin :
“My hank would gladly invest a million or a tnillion-and-
a-half in such a loan, simply in order that our cash
reserve might be earning money instead of lying
absolutely dead. There is nothing else in which it can lie
invested, for Government stock is the only security which
is always realisable.” Considering that an issue on the
local market saves the tax of 12s. 6 I. per cent, levied by
the British Government and a number of other miscel-
laneous charges, that it ftlSO saves a considerable outlay
for exchange in remitting the interest to London, that
the local market offers as good a price as is
likely to be obtained in England, and that the
transaction w'ould retain in the country £87,500 a
year in interest, this paper sets down Reid’s decision to
borrow abroad to pig-headedness, unreasoning incapacity,
and a Chinese condition of mind which makes him in-
capable of getting out of an old groove. And the conduct
of the Assembly, which passed the Loan Bill without
insisting on a distinct proviso in favor of local borrowing
—if the country “must borow —shows that that body is
fully as stupid as its leaders and is incapable of under-
standing the situation, or that it lacks the courage to
assert itself.
Premier Reid’s statement that he has “no
present intention ” of relying on the local market, sug-
gests that he looks forward to some possibility of having
such an intention later on. If the present conditions are
not good'enough to induce him to try the experiment,
under what possible set of circumstances will he “intend ”
to do so 7

Victoria has got to the end of its financial year
with a deficiency of about £112,000. The total revenue
was £6.578,355.’ The deficit is by far the smallest
since 1890, and Premier Turner believes that he sees his
way to a further saving of £400,000 or so next year,
which should produce a reliable surplus. N.S. Wales
had a revenue of £4,638,000 for the half-year, equal to
£9,276,000 per annum ; and with this huge revenue it had
a shortage of £366,000, equal to a deficiency of £732,000
annually. South Australia, so far as is known up to date,
has a deficiency of £30,000. Tasmania has an awful
shortage of £93,000, which, on a total revenue of £697,000,
is about equal to a deficiency of millions in N.S.W.
Queensland has an alleged surplus of about £lOO,OOO, hut
the Government has used so much loan money of late to
fill gaps in the revenue that verv little faith is placed in
the surpluses of the Nelson Cabinet. West Australia,
which is just now on the topiffost wave Of the boom,
expects, according to the calculations of the local Gillies,
to have a revenue of £1,125,900 and a surplus of £250,000.
A truly pathetic aspect is lent to the Westralian
surplus by the remark of Randall, M.L.0., who says that,
if things go on as they are doing, it will sooti be necessary
either to reduce taxation or to pay for some,of the public
works out of revenue. Randall made this remark with
the pained aspect of a man who was facing two possible
calamities. Westralia just now is borrowing money fast
and furiously, and if it keeps on as it is doing it will, in a
year or two,'have the biggest defefrper head of population
in Australasia. There is a chance to ease the impending
calamity by constructing some of Hie local public works
out of 'surpluses, while the boom is on and there are
surpluses, and Randall is afraid that tlte country won’t he
able to “chuck away” the opportunity. It is a matter
of political etiquette to construct (Eli, public works with
borrowed money, but if the Government won’t reduce
taxation, and the surplus can’t lie fooled away otherwise,
then Westralia may be compelled to depart, in an apilo-
getic sort of fashion, from this good old system. Randall’s
attitude is interesting, partly as showing bow badly the
borrowing disease has eaten into the vitals of Australia,
and partly as illustrating the attitude of an inflated pro-
vince which thinks its surpluses are going to last for ever.

Tlte British depositors of the City of Melbourne
Bank—the depositors are nearly all British, by the way—
engaged a very eminent firm of. London accountants to
prepare a new reconstruction scheme, and that eminent
firm has evolved a plan which, as reported by press cable,
ought to make the bank weep for joy, always provided
that the depositors adopt the proposal.- The deposits are
to be divided into two equal parts. The first is to form a
perpetual 3§ percent, stock, so that the institution will
be guaranteed the use-of the money for ever at3}.per
cent. It probably won’t want the money for ever, but
it certainly will want it for a very long while, and some
time in the dim future, when the glacial era is coming on,
fresh arrangements can be made. The other half is to
form an inscribed stock, bearing interest at 1J per cent.,
SO the average rate on the whole mass’ of deposits is 2J,
instead of the present 4J per cent. When the profits
admit, the interest on the inscribed stock is to he raised to
2J per cent., which will make tlte interest all round 3 per
cent. Two-thirds of any profits earned over and above
this are to go to redeem the inscribed stock, and the
shareholders presumably can get the balance.
Thesituation, therefore, will be as follows : (l)The
deposit interest is reduo d to a minimum of 2J or a maxi-
mum of 3 per cent.; (2) one-half the deposits are never to he
re-paid at all, and the other half are to be paid at the hank’s
own convenience ; (3) the bank has now a direct incen-
tive not to inflate its apparent profits, for any inflation
only means the obligation to pay an .extra one per cent,
on the inscribed stock and to start paying off that stock.
Therefore as no hank wants to pay an extra one per cent.,
or to pay off deposits which only cost 11 p«r cent, in-
terest, the City of Melbourne will presumably devote so
much each year to liquidating its bad business that the
visible profit will just pay the minimum rate of interest
to depositors. At least that is what any ready brainy in-
stitution would do under the circumstances, and by this
process it should, unless its condition is unspeakably
awful, become strong and solvent again—some day. (4)
The shareholders will probably get their next dividend
about the year 1950.

It is announcer! with a great flourish of trumpets
that the Queensland National Batdt is about to repay the
first instalment (due in ’99) of the Government’s recon-
structed deposit. As the Q.N.B. reconstructed £2,000,000
of public money repayable in 12 instalments of £166,000,
and as the present represents only one instalment, and as
the Government has deposited since the reconstruction
almost another £2,000,000, so that it has itself provided
the funds for the repayment nearly a dozen times over,
there isn’t much to whoop about after all.

carries forward £3931, which makes the balance to credit
of profit and loss £19,106. The National-of Maoriland

Dear Bulletin, —Lawyer Gaunson’s attempt to
represent the swindling Abrahamses as victimsof Christian
persecution was something more than-mere impudence.
It was an insult to the common sense of Melbourne people.
The fact is that Jews of a certain sort are already much
too powerful in the legal and political world, and commer-
cial morality suffers thereby. Dishonest traders, Jew and
Gentile, abound in Melbourne on the strength of their
friends at court and the ’Ouse, and the most scandalous
point about this Abrahams “persecution” is its time of
happening. The four ill-looking brethren should have
been pulled up by the authorities long ago instead of
being allowed to do their worst until English firms put
the Vic. legal machinery in motion. Christian persecu-
tion of the Jews, forsooth ! An essay ou lhat subject is
written in every ledger of every fire-insurance company.—
Yours, Premium.

The balance-sheet of the Liverpool and London
and Globe Insurance Co. shows that the income from life-
premiums for 1894, from a business which extends over
most of the British empire, was £232,348, so that three
Australasian life offices are ahead of it in Hits respect—
the A.M.P. (with over £1,200,000), the Colonial Mutual,
and the Muoriland Government Dept. The L.L.
and G. also received £213,112 as consideration for
annuities. The claims paid on life policies are £268,492,
and surrenders, management expenses, &c., make up
a total outlay of over £351,000. The exact income
of the life branch is not stated, owing to the
fire and life interest receipts being lumped together,
but the life assurance funds are over £4,600,000 (£151,904
having been added in 1894), and there is also a general
reserve of £1,300,000, a large capital, and £694,000 to
credit of profit and loss, making a very solid line of de-
fence. The expenses in the life department equal about
12 per cent, of the premium income, which is a lower
percentage than any Australasian office can show. Alto-
gether the L.L. and G.’s life department seems to be
very well managed.
The fire premiums for the year totalled
£1,618,000, and the shareholders of the L.L. and G. re-
ceive a dividend of 80 per cent.

The latest move of Tas. Treasurer Fysh is to
tax appreciation value of company shares, whether
actually realised by holders or not, as income. This hits
the Tasmania G.M. Co. very hard. Its 48,000 shares in
one year varied in quotation from £2 odd to £7 odd,
though no div. was paid during the period. Fysh now
claims that the co. produced £240,000 income during that
year, and asks shareholders for ss. income-tax on every
share ! The State is just about as big a rogue as anybody
else. Fysh can have no basis of valuation beyond public
sales or quotations ; and no man in his senses will argue
that either necessarily represent the true value even of
the parcels of shares quoted or sold—much less that from
the sale or quotation of a few shares Hie value of all un-
sold or unquoted <ian be deduced. Treas. Fysh is getting
desperately hard-up, but that doesn’t excuse him. If
any divs. are produced, he can tax them ; if he can prove
profitable sales, he can tax them; hut any court of justice
that knows its business would summarily squash his
Pyshy at tempt to tax innocent and .irresponsible persons
(or the possible results of Stock Exchange booms—at the
bottom of which, to put a purely supposilitous case,
there might be a hard-up Treasurer.

Bendigo, for the half-year ended June 30, pro-
duced 83,4280 z. gold as against 89,8960 z. for the previous
six months. The calls amounted to £s9,2ssagainst £48,739
and thedivs. to £56,507 against £60,096. Compared with the
last six months of ’94, therefore; production has decreased
by 64650 z. ; divs. have declined'by £3589, and calls have
increased by £10,516. The result, so far as shareholders
are concerned, is a dead loss of £2t4B. The biggest div.
record is that, of the Lady Barkly, which paid £ll,lOO,
and the New Prince of Wales came next with £10,125.
Then follow the New Red, White and Bine (£4200), I he Sham-
rock £3750), New Moon (£B6OO , Pearl(V3oqn), St. Mungo
(£3000), New Victoria Catherine (£2231), Hustler’s Reef
(£2024). North Shamrock (£l6OOl, New Argus. (£1500),
Saduwa(£lo66), Specimen Hill (£1000). A few straggling
returns of a few hundreds each make up the balance. Tlie
New Red, White and Blue’s 55100 z. was the biggest yield,
and the Lady Barkly and the New' Prince of Wales
followed with a little over 4000 oz. each. Among the big
mines of a few years ago, the Johnston, Princess Dagmar,
Garden Gully, Great Extended Hustlers, Hercules and
Energetic, Belmont and Saxby, United D evonshire, New
Chum Consolidated, the two Shenandoahs, Ellesmere and
almost all the rest are deceased for the time being. The
only good feature about a lamentably bad half-year is that
the end of it was very much better than the beginning,
and if the improvement is continuous, 1895 will not be
quite the failure it now appears.
The last 12 months make np the worst dividend
record Bendigo has experienced since '79. The gold-
yield, however, seems to suggest that the old field is very
far from being dead. It had worse returns in ’7B, ’79, ’BO,
’Bl, ’B7, 'B9, ’9O and ’9l, and the indomitable miners and
speculators of the city only pegged away steadily at sink-
ing their shafts further and furtherdown on the intermin-
able road to perdition, and hoped for better times': It
takes a lot to make the Bendigo mining man lose heart.
In three years, 1887-8-9, the calls exceeded dividends by
£9OOO, and the mining sharks of the Beehive lived in that
time of scarcity mostly by selling shares to each other and
getting up little halfpenny booms among themselves.
But a good many of them survived even that experience.

Manager Howell’s (B.H. Proprietary) cabled
denial of his reported intention to resign came along
about a month before the actual resignation, also wired.
Probably Howell never denied in so many words; it is
easy to imagine him, ambiguous as an oracle, fencing
with the interviewer. Questioned at Broken Hill before
leaving, he would never give a decided answer. The
mine people, anyway, must have known all along that he
was not coining back —the w holesale reversal of Howellian
policy and dismissal of highly-placed officers promoted
under the old riyim.es evidence.
Michael Davitt, at Broken Hill, noted the
absence of coherent statistics of silver production. Most
of the metal is exported in the silver-lead bullion, and a
good deal in crude ore. The figures supplied annually by
the mines for State statistical purposes give tonnage and
value of these only. The only silver recorded as such is
the comparatively small quantity produced by the amal-
gamating and leaching processes. The Proprietary is the
only co. which keeps a record of its silver production
(last figures published, 65,000,000 oz.). One estimate,
necessarily vague, puts the district’s production at
84,000,0000 z.
South mine bnddle treatment of slimes des-
cribed as satisfactory. Analysis of late figures shows that
57 per cent, of lead is saved, and the zinc reduced to 5
per cent. Silver saved, not stated ; probably little.

The four Coolgardie delegates who accom-
panied. M’Cann, who reported the Lake Cowan rush,
returned and declared the business bogus. The maker of
the report sought police protection, and in his absence an
enraged crowd made for the offices of the Courier and
Got,hen Aor and threatened 10 wreck the building, when
Warden Finnerty intervened.

The last Coolgardie sensation is reported from
Frazer's Range, where it is said five men have each been
getting lOOoz. a week, and that the Lake Cowan sensation
had its origin in this. The S.M.H. says of what it, calls
the “Health of Nations,” that the nine is opening splen-
didly—the hanging-wall glistening with gold.

Dear Bulletin, —That ever-practica! explorer,
Lindsay, interviewed in Perth, had, according to report,
no trouble in solving the Coolgardie water difficulty.
‘‘Bring it from Ml. Margaret,” says Lindsay. There is
not water enough at Mt. Margaret for local consumption,
and even if the supply was inexhaustible, there is not
enough money in VV.A. to pay for cartage of pipes
and machinery from Southern Cross to Mt. Margaret.—

The Melb. Metrop. Board of Works officers have
managi d to extinguish the man who wants “ to borrow a
bolt.” A loan-bank has been formed, in which every
member deposits 10s. monthly—this entitling him at any
time to borrow at 30 per cent, interest up to the amount
he subscribes. Any member omitting to pay his periodi-
cal instalment is charged interest at the same rate as if he
had borrowed the amount of his arrears. After the first
year’s operations each member received about £B—
£6 10s. paid up and IT 10s. interest. Since the in-
auguration of this scheme it is said that no officer ever
approaches another for a loan ; men who otherwise would
never save money have it put aside for them ; and those
who never borrow relieve themselves of an everlasting
lending of shillings and half-crowns, and, in addition,
profit by interest gained from unthrifty officers. The
scheme is Hebrew and cru*l, but very effective, and will,
The Bulletin predicts, be widely adopted in the civil
service.
Yancannia station, N.5.W.—1,091,970
acres —sold last week in Melb. for .£86,500. It is
a tine property, with a well-built homestead, four
successful bores, and 150,000 sheep. “Tom”
Shaw, of Wooriwyrite, a Camperdown (Vic.) man,
was the purchaser.
Capt. Femister, late of the good ship Cimba,
which for many years traded between London and
Sydney, is dead, H« was a popular man, and
brought to Sydney, from some little out-of-the-
way Highland distillery or other, many casks of
what was probably the best whisky that ever
came into the port.
The trial of detective John Roche, com-
mitted from the Sydney Coroner’s Court for the
alleged manslaughter of Ernest Gill, the Devon-
shire-street jeweller, will be unique in its way:
the Govt, will prosecute, and the Govt, will
defend accused. The cases of alleged assault and
battery by policemen are so numerous, and fail so
often to elicit full enquiry at the police court, that
public opinion demands a very strict investigation
of the present case at the hands of Judge and jury.
The feinting of the four brothers Abra-
-1 hams, in Melt). Criminal Court, reads pathetic
until one is told how it was done. Assisted by
pluckless hearts which turned their stummicks
against refreshments in the hour of trouble, the
delectable brethren starved themselves into a state
of nervous prostration. “Fainted from want of
food ” was surgeon Fitzgerald’s diagnosis of the
case. In the gaol hospital the Abrahams en-
deavored to keep up the farce, but pressure was
brought to bear upon them—they ate and got
better immediately.
“Michael Davitt,” writes T, P. O’Connor,
“is a man whose face would stand out in bold
relief from any crowd of men, however numerous
or remarkable. He has a narrow face with high
cheek-bones, and the thick, close black whiskers,
beard and moustache make him look almost as
dark as a Spaniard. The eyes are deep-set, bril-
liant, restless in infinite lessons of hours of agony,
of loneliness, and torture in all the million hours
which filled up his nine years of endless and un-
broken gloom in penal servitude. The frame is
slight, well-knit—the frame of a sturdy son of the
people—made taut and thin by the restless, nervous
soul within. An empty sleeve hanging by his
, side tells the tale of work in the factory in child-
hood years, and of one of the accidents which too
often maim children of the poor in the manu*
factoring disticts of England. The voice is strong,
deep and soft ; the delivery slow, deliberate, the
style of the English or American platform, rather
than of the Irish gathering by the green hillside.”
The N.S.W. solid Labor-party has definitely
thrown in its lot with the Government for the
ensuing election, and an agreement has been
arrived at by which Foreign-trade and Labor can-
didates are not to oppose each other —though
Foreign-trade and Free Labor are convertible
terms. The crowd needs to keep its eye on the
workings of this arrangement. So far, it would
seem as if the Foreign-traders were to be allowed
in consequence to have a clear field in several pro-
mising Labor electorates—in other words, that a
good many Labor men are making room for
Foreign-traders, and very few Foreign-traders
are making room for Labor men. The probable
result will be that the latter party will come back
weaker, and the former somewhat stronger than
they ought to be. This wouldn’t matter if they
could rely on always working amicably together,
but if a split should arise then the Labor men will
have lost the balance of power and gained nothing
in return. The practical absorption of the Third
Party is unfortunate. It has every right to ally
itself with the Government, but between being an
ally and being eaten there is a*wide difference.
A BEAUTIFUL COMPLEXION.
It has long been known to scientists that for
improving 1 the appearance and beautifying the
face oatmeal is far and away superior to all other
foods, but it had one drawback—the tendency to
heat the blood. To overcome this defect the at-
tention of eminent scientists has been devoted to
the removal of this imperfection ; and now, after
long years of careful and diligent research, art has
triumphed, and Unde Toby’s Rolled Oats is the
result, for, by skilful manipulation in the manu-
facture, all the heating properties have been ex-
tracted, so that now a beautiful complexion of
peach and ivory may be had by anyone who make*
a continuous use of Uncle Toby’s Rolled Oats.

Mr. JOHN LONGSTAFF, Australian artist.
John Longstaff, winner of the first travel-
ling scholarship awarded by the trustees of Melb.
National Gallery, returned to his native Victoria
the other day, after an absence of eight years.
During that time the young man who painted
“ Breaking the News - a picture familiar (by
reproduction) to miners throughout Australia—
has developed into a powerful artist, and now, at
the age of 32, John Longstaff is a man with a
name, which commands respect from the Hebrew
P'Cture-dealer of Paris or London. His principal
work, “The Sirens,” enjoyed the honor of an
audience at the Salon and, later, at the Royal
Academy, before it was presented to Melb.
Nat. Gallery, as the first-fruit of the painter’s
European labor. Mr. Longstaff has casually
mentioned that in the production of “The
Sirens ” he spent more than the money value of his
i ravelling scholarship, a point which suggested it-
self to a few Melb. people when the picture was
hung, biit which has not, so far as The Bulletin
knows, been officially recognised. By sending his
chef d'wuvre, instead of a satisfactory “ pot-
boiler,” the artist proved himself a loyal' Austra-
lian, anyhow. Although he intends to return to
London early next year, John Longstaff has re-
i.iined his nationality, and will never shake the
hist of this country from the feet of his er—er —
Ids affections, so to speak.
A Vic. medico has in, say, 20 years married

Sir Alexander Cockburn-Campbell, Bart.,
lias just been appointed Clerk of Courts at Wynd-

Judge Williams, during his summing-up

be Chief Justice. ;
Louis Becke has, in collaboration with the ,

Brewer Smith, M.L.A. (S.A.), told his

Smith talks from the lofty eminence of a K.0.M.G.-
slnp, and Australian K.’sC.M.G. are now as
common, in every sense, as aldermen.

As showing how far the lives of father and
son may stretch. The father of Rev. James Bick-

Editor Bonython, of S.A. Advertiser,
claims to have arranged the first “interview ” of
the modern sort published in the Australian press.
It was with Holy Joe Cook, of Boston, on the
occasion of his first visit to the South, and was
done by Harry Evans, now of Quiz. Many papers
quoted the interview—Melb. Argus prefacing it
with some deprecatory comments.
Bookseller Mullen, on the Melb. Block,
exhibits some early sketches in pen-and-ink by
Adam Lindsey Gordon, illustrating “The Ride
from the Wreck.” They are rough, but full of
life and feeling*, and are attracting a crowd of
sightseers. Though far behind the poems, they
have one advantage—they speak for themselves
and can’t be mangled and made ridiculous for the
self-glorification of a number of ill-conditioned
reciters with large bumps on top of their heads.

Miss Blair is the “Victorian Girl” who con-

A. W. Howitt, Victoria’s new Audit Com-
missioner and late Secretary for Mines (a son of
William and Mary Howitt) led the Burke and
Wills relief-party, and brought back the only sur-
vivor, King. He has had a worthy and un-
blemished career of 40 years’ public service, and
his appointment at the age of 65, to so onerous a
post, looks like a move to increase his prospective
pension.

modest, was in many respects a perfect model of
what a detective should he. During his official
career he obtained the conviction of nine mur-
derers, of whom seven were executed,
Michael Davitt strongly opposes capital
punishment, but admits that the weight of English
popular opinion still favors it, although the oppo-
sition feeling is increasing. He points out that
people fail to see that the only persons who can
possibly be deUrred from murder by the existence
of the hanging law' are necessarily those who
would, in any case, be too nerveless to commit a
capital crime.
A back-blocks deputation once waited on
“old Jack” Robertson to ask for the establish-
ment of telephonic communication “ between our
town and Blankville.” “Stop!” said Jack with
a wave of the hand. Then, biting bis pen-handle
viciously, he asked : “ Didn’t I answer this ques-
tion before?” “ Ye-es, I think you did,” replied
the spokesman. “ Then why the lurid hades can’t
yon he satisfied ? Dye think I’m a hlanky spider
and can sit down awl -pi n telegraph-wire, eh ?.”

doctor. The two used to
sit together at church—
Ninian is a bit of a preacher
himself—and if a message
came for the medico’s at-
tendance, the undertaker—
grim humorist !—“ would
be sure to follow a few
minutes after.”
A Melbourne paper,
rooting in the dust-heap of
history, has discovered that
an ancestor of the new
N.S.W. Governor, Viscount
Hampden, was hanged or
beheaded fore oinmon, vul-
gar murder in 1541. Thomas,
the ninth Baron Daore, who
lived in the reign of Henry
VIII., and other young men
were engaged in stealing
deer from Sir Nicholas Pel-
ham’s park when one of the
keepers was killed. Thomas
and his friends were tried
for murder and executed.
Perhaps the Imperial
authorities had this inci-
dent in mind when they
appointed the descendant
of the Hanged Baron to
the Governorship of New
South Wales. It will cer-
tainly put the local aristo-
cracy at their ease to have
a Viceroy amongst them
who can’t afford to jest on
the subject of ropes.
Robert Burdett-Smith, of Sydney, M.L.C,
and attorney, is dead. Mr. Smith, “ the Cupid
of the Macleay,” was much before the public in
his earlier years, having been the president of the
so-called “ Australian Patriotic Association ”
formed just after the attempt on the Duke of
Edinburgh’s life at Olontarf ; and it was he who
conducted the defence of bushranger Gardiner,
and organised the fund for the erection of the
Captain Cook statue in Hyde Park, Sydney. The
deceased, who for many years represented a
Northern river constituency inN.S.W. Assembly,
was notable as much for the uniform kindliness
and suavity of his nature as for his amusing and
harmless vanity. He lived and died a bachelor,
having devoted his life to his sisters. .
Dear Bulletin, —Let me supplement your
par. re the fortunes made by original Broken Hill
Proprietary holders. Reid brought a crazy plant
from Wilcannia, and did the 240 fearful miles in a
bullock-dray to start the Silver Age when Pete
Taylor’s father was making a fortune out of meat-
pies, and the Umberumberka was the ideal of big
silver lodes. Walter .Sully owned the first store
in Broken Hill and helped many a-starving pros-
pector on to fortune by a little tick and tucker.
The Horns weren’t anybody, and neither, for that
matter, were the Wilsons—the latter got their
money because they couldn’t help it. If there
were any brains in the achievement at all. the
money had the brains, and not the possessors
of the money. Charley Rasp was a boundary-
rider on Mt. Gipps, and wlen he pegged
out blocks 1 to 14, he said, “ We have got
a pig mountain of tin.” And the silver had
brains enough to get then* that time despite the
men. The Brodribbs owned Poolamacca—and
Harvey Patterson may have owned Porta at (he
time of the pegging—but he certainly held Corona
for some time prior to ’B5. Of the men you
mention, Walter Sully and Reid were the only
knowledgeable workers of the crowd wot king
knowingly with an end somewhere- Ihe oilers
simply went out on dark nights and stubbed their
toes against luck, and many of thefh on many
occasions only swore at the obstruction and passed
on. All big mining prizes are per cent, fore-
sight on the part of the prize-winners and 09| per
cent., or thereabouts, of dispensation of the pro-
vidence who put the stuff there. The fashion is
to make a hero of any man who has come through
with money, and to make a more than ordinary
hero of the man who makes coin in .mining, but I
know, and you know, that in mining lea-t of all
is the discovery to the man who really won, or
the thing that is made to him that really made it.
Walter Sully and newspaper-man Reid, in that
they worked for all they got and worked know-
ledgeably, and had bowels for the men who failed,
won the prizes they had. and made the tilings
that are theirs. But the others- mostly stubbed
their toes in the dark.— Randolph the Reckless.
South Australia proposes to build a railway
from Hergott Springs to Innamincka, thus secur-
ing the whole of the Q. border-trade. This will
certainly be an effective way of settling the ear
tiers’ grievances.

“ Autumn and winter clearing sales ” are
already the order of the day with Melb. softgoods
houses, rapid preparation being made for the big
business impulse expected with the spring. As
usual, Messrs. Crawford and Co., of Flindeis st.,

F. Yale, of Myrtleford (Vic.), referring to
a recent cablegram announcing that Professor
Frazer, of Edinburgh, had discovered that the
serum of the blood of a snake is an antidote to its
venom, states that in September last he wrote to
Prof. Halford, of Melb. Uni versify, suggesting
that an examination of snake’s blood might prove
that it contained ingredients that would act as an
antidote to snake’s venom. The suggestion does
not appear to have been acted upon; consequently,
as Mr. Vale remarks, Victoria has lost the credit
of the discovery. If the discovery is genuine, it
will be the most striking proof up to date of the
truth, of the old theory of bane and antidote being
found near each other.

S.A. Govt, is making a plucky attempt to

his tail. When Dibbs came to inspect that tail it
was found to be as short as a fox-terrier’s.

The average man must have his faith in
his “ respectable ” daily newspaper shattered, or
shaken, before he can begin to grow wise. No
mind is able to expand under the influence of
party journalism.
Chamberlain advertises a splash as Secre-
tary for the Colonies. No man knows better than
he that it is undertaking a mighty voyage across
the ocean of the impossible, to try and tinker
together, or stitch up, an Empire composed of
Australia, Maoriland, Fiji, the Straits Settlements,
Canada, a hunk of South Africa, and so on—more
especially as he is shut out from the prize com-
ponent, India.
The Na-

The rumored Tasmanian Coalition, wit i
Henry Treasurer, Lewis Attorney-General, ana
Fysh withdrawing from politics to accept
the Commissiimership of Taxes ; also with Attor-
ney-General Clark Chief Justice vice Dobson,
prospective Agent-General and Privy Councillor,
is a canard, but it set the legal profession
thinking.
The desperate straits to which N.S.W.
constituencies are reduced for eligible candidates
is shown by the alleged fact that Parkes, senior,
has already received three requisitions from as
many electorates.
A. H. Jacob, M.L.C. : “Mr. Campbell,
for whom I have the utmost contempt !” W. It.
Campbell : “A nice old Chairman of Committees
you are !” (Derisive laughter.) “ The dignity of
the N.S.W. Legislative Council!”
Mr. Holman is a candidate at N.S.W.
general election. So is Mr. Rosa. So is Mr.
Hurley ; likewise Mr. Nobbs. Ditto Mr. Griffin.
Dear old familiar names! Mr. Griffin is now
understood to be a “sound Freetrader.”
It would be as fair for Premier Reid, who
proposes devoting a million of his new English
loan to “ repairing Windsor (N.S.W.) bridge,’ &c.,
&e., to float a loan in London to raise funds for
the purpose of patching the pyjamas of the
Ministry,
Some enthusiastic persons proposed, a few
days ago to run George Dean for Parliament. One
such experiment should be more than enough.
The far from brilliant Sleath is sufficient proof
that being in gaol is not reliable proof of Legisla-
tive ability.
Davitt visited and was delighted with the
S. A. Village Settlements on the Murray. The
Victorian experiment appeared to him a great
contrast. There he found that .£35,000 had been
wasted on the movement, the only result of which
has been, not to put heart into the men, but to
deprive them of the last vestige of spirit remain-
ing in their bodies.
Parkes asserts that he appointed N.S. VV.
Upper Chamber law-makers without reference to
party preferences. True enough —in part. They
were chosen from all sections of Patman. Where
is the Parkes appointment that was satisfactory
to the Democracy ? Also, has there ever yet been
a Council appointment that entirely commended
itself to that insignificant body—the People ?
Archibald Campbell, M.P. for the Hlawarra
(N.S.W.), colliery electorate, and an alleged
Freetrader, is understood as supporting all Pre-
mier Reid’s Freetrade proposals except with
regard to “coke.” There is a big coke industry
in Campbell’s electorate. Griffith, who voted
Freetrade in everything except candles, stands on
the same footing. Every Freetrader has one in-
dustry that he would like protected.
The immediate effect of Premier Reid’s
scheme of N.SAV. Legislative Council reform
would be the removal of the twelve oldest mem-
bers—G. H. Cox, L. F. De Sal is, George Thorn-
ton, James Norton, John Stewart, Richard Hill,
P. G. King, John Lucas, W. H. Suitor, Geo. Lee,
and probably Henry Mort and Edmund Webb.'
Any or all of the 12 are eligible for re-appoint-

ment, but, excepting W. H. Suttor, it is safe to say
that G. H. Reid would not re-nominate one of them.
The Bill to authorise a syndicate to annex
the water-power of the Yarra for the purpose of
supplying Melbourne with electricity is again
turning up in Vic. Assembly. This proposed
grab is several dozen times less justifiable than
the one which is being attempted in Sydney. The
Sydney municipal authorities are doing nothing
in the way of electric-lighting, so the Grose and
Cold Valley crowd can pretend that it is trying to
fill a want, but the Melbourne Council is steadily
lighting up its city with the new illuminant, and
the syndicate calmly demands that it be allowed
special facilities so that it may cut out the muni-
cipal authorities and levy toll on the city. Every
Vic. democrat should keep a hostile eye on this
ugly speculation lest it gets rushed through un-
noticed.
The Bulletin notes with satisfaction that
Chief Secretary Peacock has struck out the flog-
ging-clause from the Vic. Gaols Act Amendine-nt
Bill. The clause was originally inserted by J. B.
Patterson at the instigation of the Inspector-
General of penal establishments, who in bis annual
reports has made repeated demands for more
“ cat.”

A much - needed reform :
Appointment to the Australian

Crick’s bill to place Kanakas, Japanese,
coolies, Javanese and other cheap colored laborers
under the same restrictions as the Chinaman,
was blocked by the Reid Ministry and cast out
by 38 votes to 20, the majority being composed of
the Cabinet and its followers, with a portion of
the Labor-party. The reason assigned was that
“ the matter was one which should be dealt with
by Government.” So far, the Government hasn’t
dealt with it, despite last year’s resolution of the
Assembly that it should be dealt with immediately,
.■and the cheap nigger keeps arriving gaily. Nor
will it ever be dealt with until the Premier of the
day dares to stand up in the Assembly and declare
that he will never take an T nperial title.
Premier Reid : ‘ ‘ There
is no better investment in the
world than to forfeit office
with honor.’’ That’s what
they all say. But what they
mostly do is to forfeit honor
with office.
The British House of
Lords has passed the bill
authorising colonial Judges
to sit on the Judicial Com-
mittee of the Privy Council.
It is unlikely the Commons
will deal with it before Lite
dissolution ; but doubtless it
will be resurrected in the new
Parliament. Certain Austra-
lian Judges, who are getting
very uneasy in their seats,
devoutly hope so. But there
is still uncertainty on the
vital point of screw ; and, if
Britain does not pay this,
Australia will not. In any
case, the proposal is anti-
national and obnoxious.
Last financial year the
architectural branch of Vic.
Public Works Dept, paid in
salaries <£13,000 to 45 officers
for carrying out£2o,ooo worth
of work. The .£13,000 does
not include stipends of cor-
responding clerks, accoun-
tants and others indirectly
employed. The best private
architects discharge similar
duties for 5 per cent, on the
cost : which means that what
Vic. Govt, had to pay £13,000
for, it could have got done
equally well for <£looo out-
side.
The chief difference between Pilcher’s
scheme of N.S.W. Upper House reform, which
the Council teems willing to accept, and Reid s
scheme, which it utterly abhors, is that the former
provides that the present fossils shall hold office for
life, and the new system will only apply to their
successors. The Councillors don’t even object to
reform on principle. All they want is that they
shouldn’t be reformed ; the next batch of M.L.C. s
may take their chance. Unluckily, the country
can’t afford to wait.
The programme on which the N.S.W.
Opposition appeals to the country has for its prin-
cipal features : Protection, Federation, reform of
the Council, State life assurance in place of the
Civil Service Superannuation Fund, establishment
of a State Export Department (somewhat after
the model of that existing in Victoria), exclusion
of colored labor, local government, relief to
selectors by reduction of their annual payments to
Gd. per acre, water conservation and irrigation,
establishment of national smelting works ana
schools of mines, and sundry labor reforms.
Says Sydney Telegraph : “ The labor
that declares for land taxation knows well enough
that it must get what it wants, not with the aid
of the protectionist but in spite of him, the two
fiscal aims being widely dissimilar in design and
incidence.” In other words, Protection and
Land-tax are irreconcilable. Considering that
Victoria, South Australia, Tasmania, Maoriland,
and Queensland are all protected provinces, and
that four of them levy two separate land-taxes,
one for local and the other for State purposes,
while the fifth (Queensland) levies a land-tax for
local purposes only, and that in N.S.W. the liee-
trade party has successfully avoided imposing a
land-tax, for local or any other purposes, over 99
per cent, of the area of the province, this is a really
first-class lie.
The “Young Patriots’” association, the
juvenile branch of S. A. Ass, has elected six ladies
to its committee. Yet the Ass opposed Woman
Suffrage because “ no pure woman would forsake
the domestic hearth for politics.”
On the 24th of this month The Bulletin
v.ints to go toN.S.W. poll and vote for Australian
Federation, a thorough system of Protection, a
land-tax with exemption up to (say) .£5OO, an
efficient betterment law, reform of the Council, a
State paper currency, a State life-assurance sys-
tem, local government, a State drink monopoly,
no more foreign borrowing, the abolition of party
Government, exclusion of colored labor, and a few
other things ; and it wants to vote against Parlces,
Reid, Dibbs, Lyne, M'Millan, Gag Gould, and
about a dozen other people; also against foieign
titles and Imperial Federation, and to express its
disgust at the financing of the .crowd now in office,
and its serious doubts as to Xhe financial capacity
of the other crowd. And unless some kind of
machinery is provided by which it can vote as
above, it respectfully submits that the voice of the
country is being stifled.
The true cause of the growth of Victoria's
woollen duties is never breathed in Parliament.
When Protection stood at 15 per cent, the mill-
owners were satisfied. They turned out certain
tweeds which the lightly-handicapped importers
couldn’t equal at the price, and they hadn’t com-
mitted themselves to the folly of trying to make
all tweeds, in any patterns, without due considera-
tion of the fact that expensive fabrics can’t be
made in great variety, on reasonable terms, for a
small market. The aforesaid folly had its
day, no doubt; nevertheless the wise men of
the trade have always known that Protec-
tion is incapable of building up a large trade
in woollen-coatings, until the gradual
increase of population or the abolition of
border Customs enlarges the market.
The mills could do a certain thing with
the aid of a 15 per cent, duty, and 150
per cent, wouldn’t secure them any
fuither against foreign competition.
Yet the duty was raised by easy stages
up to 40 per cent, in 181)2. Not in the
interests of manufacturers, but for the
benefit of big importers who secretly
agitated for the “ poor ” mill-owners.
Kach increase of duty put thousands
of pounds extra value into the stocks
of expensive fabrics not locally manu-
factured, which commercial Fat Man
had stored up. Now his stocks are
running out, and the game is abandoned.
A PROTUBERANCE.
Ethel I heard Mr. Squatter say Pa had too much dignity .’
JACK : “ It does stick out a good deal in grout."
“F.”: Tory says Protection reduces prices—
to famine.* “Good boots, in Melb., 45.” Similarly.
Freetrade produces finance swindles—Jabez Bal-
four in London. Similarly, the law against
murder is responsible because it doesn’t prevent
burglary. Similarly, the hen is responsible
because the farmer let her eggs go rotten. Simi-
larly, the social system is anathema because it is
complex and not to be perfected by any single
amendment.
GUESS!
“We have a little present here,”
In accents sweet and mild
The deputation said—“ It’s yours !’’
The legislator smiled.
“What is it?” with a flitting blush,
The legislator said,
They answered—“ It’s a poultice for
A swelling of the head.”
The legislator thanked the crowd —
He hardly could do less —
And cursed them in his heart. Who was
The legislator ? Guess I

Society
Acting-Gov. Darley and family have gone
into residence at Government House, Sydney—
the first instance of the sort on record.
• mm
Acting-Grovernoress Madden’s first recep-
tion at Melb. Government House ended in a big
rush for the excellent refreshments provided. It
was the most miscellaneous assemblage of the sort
to date: thriee-diluted royalty has no terrors for
the populace. Not content with the free feast,
the “callers” rushed the tables at the last and
bore away the flowers in triumph.
* * *
A Melb. society lady, whose money went
with the banks, has taken a milk-walk in St,
Kilda; and now her carts serve milk to former
friends and associates, beginning with Govt.
House. Her old and loyal school-friend, the wife of
the Acting-Governor, was the first to set her name
down on the list of supporters. After which it
was what sporting men call a (milk) “ walk-over ”
for the enterprising lady, whose example will no
doubt be followed—the dressmaking and tea-room
ideas being nearly played out.
• • •
The Austral Wheeling Club, the Melb. lady
cyclists’ society—a feeble infant from its birtli—
has’died through sheer weakness. It was a ques-
tion right through of “rational” dress v. skirts—
and neither party has won. The majority of
members joined the Vic. Cycling Tourists’ club—
a “swagger ” coterie chiefly composed of doctors
and barristers. And the ladies of the A.W.C.
• having taken a warmer interest in the Tourists
(which had many nice men in it) than in their own
club, it was decided to amalgamate with the
Tourists.
“Rational ” dress, so say the “rational ” women,
distinguishes all the leading Melb. lady cyclists ;
and it is further asserted that the skirted crowd,
whose attenuated shanks are mercifully concealed
from the vulgar gaz“, merely potter about the
suburbs on tram-tracks. The rational women do
long distances —from 30 to 100 miles a day.
m * *
Prior to the breaki >g-up of a certain Ade-
laide college last year, (!<>v. Kintore, who had
received an invitati >n to be present at the
gathering, got a letter, wri'ten in a school-
boy’s hand, requesting him “not to attend,
as he wasn’t wanted.” The kilted Kintore
rather meanly sent the missive to the head-
master, who traced it to the son of a local lawyer.
There were, of course, profuse apologies from the
school authorities, and the offender was told to
choose between flogging or expulsion. He chose
the former, and accepted a “big flaying” without
a budge. Whether the motive was red Republi-
canism or sheer mischief, The Bulletin can’t say
for certain, but possibly the youngster regards
himself as a martyr in the cause of Australian
Independence.
» # •
The sacred slush-lamp of “ oratory ” flared
high at Sydney U.S. Consulate on the Glorious
Fourth of Clap-trap. The “Anglo-Saxon ” shriek
didn’t soar quite so wildly to heaven as aforetime,
but Sydney Amurkans were on the job with a
gorgeously saponaceous fantasia upon the surpass-
ing excellences of Colonel Tintinnabulum. Which
kind of fustian sets The Bulletin wondering why
it is that a people who have, on the one hand, re-
duced English speech to its lowest terms of
tersity —vide that star of condensed English, the
“Rough on Rats”advt. —should be so liable, on
the other, to erupt on the smallest provocation
into a tawdry grandiloquence, which is no more
eloquence than a pumpkin is a pineapple.
* m *
The latest big shortage in the funds of a
N.S.W. public company was the direct result of
pony-racing. Pony-racing is now an Australian
social cancer. Formerly men went to the devil
through keeping harems; now ponies are the
medium. Lots of men who would be afraid to
keep a racehorse invest in a pony—salving their
alleged consciences with the excuse that “it is
only a little one.”
« # *
Premier Turner (Vic.) avoids “ style ” and
lives in a modest little six-roomed wooden cottage
in St. Kilda. Attorney-General Isaacs, Minister
of Lands Best, and others, reside in more pre-
tentions residences. Mrs. Isaacs is a tall and
beautiful daughter of Israel, with a languishing
look and the air of a woman who takes life easily.
It is averred that when Isaac A. Isaacs was en-
gaged to the lady he carried his law-books to hei
mother’s house and studied, instead of altogether
wasting precious evenings in sentimentalism.
Mrs. Robert Best is a pleasant little woman with
an ambition to be thin, and is dieting herself
accordingly. She is fond of society, and enter-
tains a great deal in her fine house in Nicholson-
street. Minister Peacock is still a bachelor—
“and no wonder, with such a laugh,” say his
enemies. However, marriage might cure him. It
has cured many a man of laughing.
m * *
In the Melb. gun-frauds case Judge Wil-
liams explained the legal unimportance of con-
spiracy charges to the jury. “ Conspiracy,” he
saiil, “was a charge which seemed to have a very
ugly sound, but they would be surprised when be
told them that conspiracy was not a felony, simply
a misdemeanor. . . . For that reason he had
alluded to the accused throughout as defendants,
instead of as prisoners, as was usual in cases of
felony.” Just here it occurred to the jury that
certain influential defendants were merely charged
with a misdemeanor in certain banking matters.
• # *
Emanuel, Louis, Alfred and Edward Abrahams ap-
peared at the Criminal Court, yesterday, to answer the
charge of conspiracy to defraud certain of Her Majesty’s
subjects. . . Shortly before the Court met Edward and
Louis Abrahams were seized by fils and carried out of
court. . . Tlie foreman replied that the jury had not
yet arrived at a verdict. At this moment Alfred
Abrahams fell face downwards on the floor of the court
AUSTRALIAN I R REVERENCE AGA IN.
HER AUNT : “ Did you, remember to nay ‘my Lord ’ when you were introduced

DEBUTANTE: “ Oh, yes; the expression popped out quite naturally whenever J

and was carried out. . . The jury then retired to
further consider their verdict, and at 25 minutes past I 2
p.m. returned. In the meantime, Emanuel Abrahams,
the sole defendant who had up to that time remained in
court, was also seized by a fit, so that the whole of the
defendants were absent when the jury gave their verdict.
— Melh. paper.
After the scenes in court during the
Abrahams affair, giving a man “ fits ” acquires a
new significance.

Lex ; “ The Abrahams case revives dis-
cussion on judicial sentences. Look at the
manner in which the sliding-scale might have
been applied, and one can assume that every
Melbourne Judge would have given the four
brothers a different whack. How much more
satisfactory to have *the sentence dealt out, as in
America, by the jury, after the Judge has in-
structed them on the limits of maximum and
minimum. After all, where is the superiority of
a Judge over another man in fixing a sentence ?’’

Countess Wachtmeister is careful to re-
mark that nobody just now on earth is a Theoso-
pliist—at must, they can be only members of the
Theosophioal Society.
Theosophy is the natural ally of Spiritualism, and
must always be the easy victim of vulgar frauds.
Theosophy phis its faith to an astral body, or
something luminous, which the Wachtmeister has
seen “shining through ” a pious Hindoo when he
was so deeply engaged in prayer, for an hour at a
stretch, that a Cannon fired off at his elbow
wouldn’t have aroused him from his spiritual
state. A lady who can see such a staggering
phenomenon as this will always perceive with
gladness Mrs. M Jlon’s Josephine dematerialising
down into the floor, although she is all the time
watching the tail-end of little Josey’s white sheet,
as Mrs. M. draws it behind the black curtains of
her “cabinet.”

Sydney dailies have ceased publishing
“ wills of the week.” And thereby, it is declared,
hangs a tale.

Can it be really true that on its having
been reported that nine prisoners out of 360 in
Parramatta Gaol were medically allowed stimu-
lants daily, the N.S.W. prison department ordered
that “ white spirit mixed with a nauseous drug"
should be the only alcohol ever supplied for the
use of sick prisoners? If so, then in Lagland
may be seen at one and the same time an indig-
nant and virtuous Government prosecuting and
fining numerous publicans for selling “ white
spirit,” on the ground that it is a deleterious and,
in fact, poisonous liquor ; and the almost irrespon-
sible bosses of a defenceless element of the popula-
tion prescribing “ white spirit,’ that officially
deleterious liquor, that official and legal poison,
combined with a “nauseous drug,’ for the sick
and enfeebled unfortunately under their care.
After giving a sick prisoner some fusel-oil-cum-
noxious-drug, it may be presumed that the official
gaol humorists gag him to prevent him spitting it
out.

A Melb. man was surprised, the other
day, by his wife dropping in, after 10 years’
absence in England. She had sent out a woman,
of humble station, to take care of him.

the lady who
is now making
a happy man
cf him.
Home Chat, a London paper of the small
and recent kind, publishes an elevating interview
with Lady Kintore. The visitor found the noble
countess dusting some fine ornaments with her
own fair hands in her beautiful drawing-room.
It was probably a glorious day at the time, but
the state of the weather isn’t recorded. Lady
Kintore made no attempt to disguise her action,
“ I can see no shame in labor,” was her ladyship’s
remark. “ I honor the women who, having pretty
things, make a point of dusting them themselves.
Why should we not?” To The Bulletin it
seems that Lady K.’s character is scarcely less
beautiful than her drawing-room, and quite as
fine as her ornaments. She is proud of the spirit
of industry which impels her to polish up her
little bits of china with a cloth, and if circum-
stances forced her to pass a feather-brush across a
picture her ladyship would not be ashamed. The
Nobility of Labor is established.

Canon Tucker and Dr, Charles Strong, the
founders of village settlement in Victoria, are
understood to have got themselves into an
unfinancial state “ through guarantees” on behalf
of the needy people they placed upon “the soil.”
The settlers are not paying their way as yet, and
vast arrears of grocery-bills, &c., hang like a cloud
over the heads of the poor parsons, and their slum-
bers are broken by the bark of the mundane
bailiff, who wants his pound of flesh. Therefore,
a subscription has been started for the release of
Messrs. Tucker and Strong aforesaid. Also, a
benefit to the same good cause will take place at
Melb. Town Hall on July 16—19, or thereabouts,
and a strong programme, of a musical, social, and
scientific character, is announced.

The hardest knock Brother Windeyer has
yet received (flom S.M. Herald)
The result of the finding of the Commission in restoring
Dean to liberty will certainly give relief to the feeling of
the public, and will perhaps supply weighty reminder of
the necessity of great caution and thoroughness of inves-
tigation to those responsible for the administration of
justice.
Not much ; but consider—the Herald ! Et tu,
Brute !

A corollary of the Dean Commission is
that the N.S.W. Govt, should pay all the expenses
attached to the examination of witnesses, etc.,
called by the Dean Defence Committee. It is a
brutal law, anyhow, that a man or his friends
must pay all the expenses of proving that the
Govt, has wrongfully suspected him, although
that is a wrong which occurs every day.
IN SUCH A NIGHT
(FOR THE BULLETIN)
A flood of moonlight from the sky,
Where far stars faintly twinkle ;
And, softened by the night-wind’s sigh.
Is heard the horse-bell’s tinkle.
Above—the drooping myall leaf ;
Below—the fire-log glowing ;
And stately pines in swart relief
Against the light sky showing.
The massy bloodwoods sway and shake,
The moon-steeped box-leaves glisten ;
And e’en the wild hawk’s nestlings wake
In wonderment to listen
To lullabies (more tuneful far
Than any song of Morning !)
That night-winds sigh when moon and star
The heavens are adorning.
Young hearts may know a music rare,
When Springtide dawns are breaking,
Whilst boughs are dew-gemmed everywhere
And wanton birds are waking.
But dusky Night!—when hopes lie dead,
And summer dreams have faded,
When darkened are those lights which led,
Ere following steps grew jaded.
Her melodies the power possess,
When days drag lone and dreary ;
To lull the heart’s own bitterness,
And soothe a soul world-weary.
Warrego.
THE BREAKER.
FIT AND PROPER.
When they “ pull ” your Nibs for swindling
And the prospect groweth blue :
When yon feel, with courage dwindling,
That a sentence must ensue :
At this crisis most appalling
You must prove your native wit
By appropriately falling
In an epileptic fit.
Where’s the good in showing grit?
It
Is time to have a fit—
A dropper-dooney, “ copper’’-sooney, opportuney
fit.
Let the vulgar desperado
Gaily quaff his bitter cup,
And indulge in vain bravado
When the game is fairly up :
Let him gammon not to grumble
When he gets his “ little bit
Were he wiser, he would tumble
On the floor and have a fit.
When your hopes of freedom flit,
It
Is time to have a fit—
A sort-o’-croakey, courtey-strokey, though t-o’-
ohokee fit.

The Melbourne tradesman who was got at
by a bogus lord, the other day, says “he trusted
the gentleman because he had an aristocratic
appearance, and seemed on such intimate terms
with the nobility.” That is the sort of dealer who
is likely to rush a real nobleman into the back
drain on his aristocratic ear, deceived by the baggi-
ness of his pants and his sheep-like profile.
Dear Bulletin, —

medical staff will be
most concerned. Have
something as obscure the
matter with your liver as
Guv. Dull had, and you’ll
be, pro tern., as impor-
tant a personage with the
doctors as he was ; but be
a miserableoutcast, dying
without a friend in the
world, and all the “sym-

you’ll get from the aver-
age “ cap-and-streamers”
will be just what is com-
pelled by the regulations!

A. K. M’Donald, of New Australia, writes
to an Argentine paper :
Communism certainly renders people more selfish. Some
of its evidences here are ludicrous enough. At the general
dining-table eacli has his private bottle of treacle, which
he stows away between m als, under his pillow or else-
where as best he can, while quite a number carry their
utensils to and from the table with them knives, forks,
etc., hiving a trulj’’ amazing faculty for disappearing
through carelessness on a communistic settlement).
What is the good of true inateship when you have
to sleep with the treacle-bottle under your pillow
for fear some brother will make away with it?

whose knowledge of Ids birthmarks was really
extraordinary, and who pressed her claim again

of which be remarked that be was unequal to his

The fight for the Australian chess cham-
pionship started in 1887, when Charlick beat
Esling by half a point only. Since then the con-
tests have steadily grown in interest and import-
ance. Nearly all the metropolitan dailiis
have published every morning the scores in
the just-completed match between Esling, the
Victorian champion, and Wallace, champion
of Australia. Toe struggle resulted in Wallace
retaining his laurels, after a series of 1(1 hardly-
fought games, of which lie won 7 h. E-ding won
5,j, and 3 were drawn (one draw counted to each
player). The players were very evenly matched
Wallace, perhaps, showing himself the more
brilliant and the more skilled ; while Esling,
perhaps, played sounder chess, though he
lost the fruit of his labor through blunders at
critical points. Wallace is a Queenslander, only
22, with a natural genius for the game. Esling is
older, and was educated in Germany, where
he held his own with many leading players.
Both have justified their previous reputations.


Hygiene teaches that nothing is so bene-

J uly 9,1895,
My Dear Moorabinda—
N.S.VV. Dog-and-Fowl Society’s Show, at
Sydney Exhibition, ran four days to very badly-
behaved audiences. To the average poor, weak
woman this annual bow-wow contest is merely
the infallible recipe for a splitting headache taken
on its noisy merit alone, and when to the yap-
pings of the friend of man is added the reek of
mixed brands of ’baccy smoked in the building by
the man himself, it’s no wonder the Dog Show is
generally weak in human feminine interest. There
was nothing the matter otherwise with the well-
organised exhibition. The dogs were splendid,
ranging from bow-wows as big as ponies to dear
little fluffy handsful you could put in your pocket.
I liked the little dogs best. One first-prize English
terrier likean animated bottle-brush with big brown
eyes and a heavenly temper made me long to be
a N.S.W. policeman with power to grab any tyke
I fancied. But dog-culture doesn’t seem to be a
favorite woman-hobby—at any rate very few of
the placards bore the names of owneresses, though
the ugliest-looking hound which took a blue
ribbon—a brindled thing with a face that was a
positive breach of the peace—was owned by a
spinster. I should think such a sulky-looking
beast would represent the average husband admir-
ably.
The feathers department made a royal show —
fine, upstanding, glossy roosters, looking as if
somebody had groomed them, with wives en
suite. I don’t know whether it’s anew departure
for the poultry-yard, but it seems as if the usually
homely egg-producers were putting on more color
as the years go by. One gamecock, striped in the
gayest primal hues, was as gaudy as a parrot, and
such a combination of coquettish plumage and
solid business ability, so to speak, must make
poultry-farming a dream of beauty which also
pays the bills. I suppose the next step in fowl-
culture will be the radiant hen that will give the
nightingale’s trill instead of the usual cackle when
she lays an egg, and when she arrives the day of
the bilious canary wi IP be done. Nobody could
withstand the attraction of fresh eggs set to
music. By the way, a pair of geese valued at
.£2OO were on show. At this, rate, the descendants
of the birds which saved Rome are worth more in
Australia than many a good horse. A few weeks
ago a man I know was applied to by an industrious
laborer for assistance. My friend got him the
loan of a spring-cart and gave him £1 “ to buy a
horse.” He bought one at the bazaar for 14s ! and
with the balance purchased a very small stock of
hawkables to start with. And ever since he has
managed to make a living.
Talking of birds reminds me of a remark made
by a N.S.W. farmer the other day. His orchard
in a boy-infested district—had been pretty well
denuded of fruit, and when somebody suggested
“ birds ” as'the thieves, the farmer smiled (farmers
do smile occasionally) incredulously. “ Two-
legged birds,” he said at last, in a voice full of
meaning. In some parts of Australia the denizens
of the air are evidently four-footed.
1 had it in my heart to buy a little dog at the
dog-show—l would have if it hadn’t been for
Policeman X. The present system of giving two
shillings for every tyke a “ bobby ” skulldrags
into the canine slaughter-house is turning the
N.S.W. foorce into mere dog-trappers (not to use
a harsher word), who don’t always wait until Toby
is taking a run out of bounds to bag him ! People
who own dogs are never surprised to see a helmet
looking longingly over their back fence in the
direction of the dog-kennel. One day a Sydney man
found a man in blue hanging half-way over the back
gate that stood between him and a very special sort
of terrier, which, of course, merely represented
a possible florin to the preserver of lawnorder.
The blue minion retired hurriedly when this was
calmly explained to him by the dog’s owner !
It is very sanitary and all that to make an
occasional holocaust of diseased or disabled stray
dogs, but to have this pup-surveillance going on
like the taxes from New Year’s Day to Xmas is
a thing to be resented by everybody who owns a
barker. I think the dog arrangements of Sydney
want to be violently overhauled now that the
colony of scratchy, blotchy mongrels which used
to infest the tram waiting-rooms has been duly
sacrificed.
Another show lately billed in Sydney was the
sheep-show—more of a masculine dissipation,
altho’ Lady Darley (who is a regular mill-horse at
the patronising racket) tied the blue ribbons round
the champions. Wool is so fashionable, don’t you
know; and sheep move in the very best Australian
circles, indirectly speaking; so the s.s. was dis-
tinctly the proper thing to “do,” even if you
don’t know a lambkin from a battering-ram.
From an outside aspect it was a dusty exhibition
of jumbucks in the purlieus of Pyrmont—but,
then, how inherently pure merino !
I regret to note the death, after a lingering ill-
ness, of Mr. K. Bnrdett Smith. To those who
knew him beat he was a model of kindness and
unfailing courtesy, and his demise will be sincerely
regretted by all who ever met him on friendly
terms. His interment, tho’ private, was largely
attended, and many flowers were sent.
Sydney is having rather a bad time at the hands
of Miss Decima Moore, whose bronchial-tubes
have been playing up, to the temporary wreck and
ruin of her lovyer register. Consequently, Miss
Moore is not visible “ In Town ” in any sense,
for she is at present sojourning with Mrs. Pat
Osborne at Currandooley, accompanied by Mr.
Cecil Hope and bis brother ; so the .local stage sees
her no more until “The Shop Girl” goes up. It
is to be hoped that the change inland will set
Miss Moore on her vocal pins again, for the Gee
Gees are prima-donna- less until she comes back.
Sydney is a bad place for people whose vocal
chords are not cast-iron.
A visit to Decima Moore is a pleasant experi-
ence, not only because she makes such a lively
hostess, but partly because she has so many
attractive odds-and-ends in her wake. One of her
greatest treasures is a pale-sea green-silk tea-
gown, exquisitiyely embroidered by Chinese
hands, and there is a whole trayful of real Indian,
Japanese, and_Chow embroideries on silks of
every color, which are destined to adorn her house
in town (meaning the Big Smoke) when she goes
into double harness. There are also priceless table-
drapes, ornamented with Arabic signs—which re-
minded me of Mr. Haskett Smith’s remarks re
such upholstery. He said that some of their
queer Arabic draperies, if translated into English
words, would clear the drawing-room of ladies in
less than no time! Miss Moore’s most-prized
spoils from the East, however, are two hideous
masks representing the faces of Satanic old men
with bloodshot eyes and marks of leprosy. They
are acutely hideous and of exquisite workman-
ship ; but Miss Moore’s maid fails to see their un-
mistakeable art, and covers them over when she is
left alone with them. Live-stock has no place
in Miss Moore’s apartments (unlike Sarah Bern-
hardt s), though she hankers after an Australian
native-bear for a pet with the same hanker that
Sarah did. Miss Moore’s personal hobby is the
kodak. She has a bookful of clever little pictures,
including pop-shots of a race-finish that is full
of go.
Apropos of the frisky boarding-house story now
being circulated at the expense of a couple of
subordinate members of a theatrical co., don't let
us be too hard on the lady in tights, who presum-
ably doesn’t know any better. It is not only the
dame du theatre who plunges over the conven-
tional pole in her hours of ease. She may turn
round and quote the Sydney society barn-dancers,
or the lately-whispered story concerning a recent
society bridegroom and the stylish belle he did not
marry. And, as for cigarettes, isn’t the story still
fresh of the Melbourne belle who strolled into the
smoking-room of a swell pub. and seated herself
comfortably, to the horror of the waiter, who has-
tened to inform her she had got into the smoker?
“ Of course I have,” she replied, putting her little
feet up on a vacant chair and lighting a cigarette.
And, nearer home, weren’t some poker-minded
people horribly shocked at a girls’ luncheon-party
recently given by some of the toniest girls in
Sydney, when “the smokes” circulated after the
sweets, as a matter of course?
As the crowd that rushed the booking-office to
reserve seats for “In Town” almost razed the
premises—brass-rods were snapped like deal, and
women had to be dragged over the counter for
safety—a packed house on the first night was a
foregone conclusion. It was an abnormally big
attendance, and the clergy should feel pardon-
ably proud that their little advt. has been produc-
tive of such good social results. By the way, I
think Maud Hobson is chiefly responsible for this
clerical choler—doesn’t she say in the cynical
“Gaiety Girl”: “I make a point of knowing
deans. The clergy are occasionally dull, but
they’re always respectable ’ ’
There is only one act—the first—in “In Town,”
where the sartorial interest is up-to-date—after
that things tail off into tights. Grace Palotta
takes all the tricks in Act I. In a flesh-pink dress
flounced to the hips, each flounce edged with a
black line —a black moire bodice with pink frilled
sleeves, a pink Toreador hat with pink and black
pom-poms well to the back, and a Tosca stick
with a big flesh-pink bow, the bewitching Palotta
looked like a modern dressmaker’s ideal of the
Spirit of Carnival—she was so stylishly outre.
Laura Kearney’s meek ivory-silk with a bird’s-
eye dot looked quite milk-and-watery beside her.
Miss Kearney, who evolutes from the chorus into
Decima Moore’s part during Miss Moore’s indis-
position, is a negatively pretty girl without any
glaring histrionic ability, but possessing a taking
mezzo-soprano voice of rather uncertain attack,
perhaps, yet full of color. If Miss Kearney didn’t
paint her nose so white, and didn’t try so hard to
behave herself, I think she might get to the top of
the tree some day.
Blanche Massey dressed the Duke’s daughter,
k la “ Gaiety Girl,” in floppy white muslin, with
a bunch of pansies at the low-cut neck, and a
romantically-scrunched white hat. Miss M.
evidently gets her fashion-tips from off the covers
of fashionable waltz-music. I liked Florence
Lloyd as Lord Clanside. Asa boy, one forgave a
certain podginess of outline and breadth of beam,
and Miss Lloyd looked acceptably and neatly
masculine until Louis Bradfield turned up, show-
ing the most elegant waist in the piece, beauti-
fully accentuated by a well-cut coat. Then
Florence went to pieces as a convincing male-
impersonator, and I think the clumsy shape Miss
Lloyd (who is a fine and shapely woman) cut
beside the graceful outlines of Mr. B. ought to
give pause to those ladies who show signs of want-
ing to grab the breeks from poor, weak man.
The second act is given over to the untranslat-
able fig-leaves of burlesque—barring Blanche
Massey, who scooted through in a china-tea-oup
patterned brocade with diaphanous chiffon on the
top-end and a pink frill down below. Palotta
wore a pink garment with pink shoes and stock-
ings and a white muslin apron—also a great rush
of paint to her lips, and Laura K. suggested a
slab of the Milky Way in white and silver with a
bough of white flowers, which she held as St.
Joseph holds his lily in stained glass. Madge
Rossell looked like a dewy cobweb in the moon-
light, in soft grey draperies with glints of silver j
and Maud Hobson, as Romeo, wore black tights,
and revealed a pair of shapely legs curving down
to a neat pair of ankles. But I did not appreciate
Maud as a sort of Alabama Coon in striped breeks
and a necessary red sash. There is rather too
much of Maud (speaking behind her back) for
bifurcation. No flowers encouraged the premiere,
although it was very evident that the girls now
have somebody to wink at in the front stalls j but
then the drought has exaggerated the price of
vegetables from horse-carrots upwards.
To me, “ In Town ” seems full of suggested
situations and tableaux which never come off.
For example, the actress, closely pursued by the
Duke, gets into the joint ducal bedroom, but the
Duchess doesn’t come buck, as everybody expects,
to find her there 1 Then the ducal daughter pays
a visit to the actress’s dressing-room and asks to
fit on the actress’s stage-gowns—something with
tights in it preferred, of course—but when the
d.d. re-appears, it’s in the same familiar evening
dress, and the audience falls back into the same
old weary uncertainty as to how thick Miss
Massey’s ankles really are. Then when the gay
and piff-paff captain, who has been dodging a
writ all through the piece, has to accept it in the
last act, it isn’t a writ at all, but a legacy.
News of Governors dribbles in, and I couldn’t
help feeling sorry for South Australia when I read
the first cabled speech of Sir Tough Fowell Bux-
ton, who is going to step into the shoes Acting-
Gov, Way is keeping stretched for him. By the
way, there is great friction in the ’Oly City just
now between Guvmentouse and the city fathers,
partly owing to the haughty proceedings of the
A.G. at the citizens’banquet to Gov. Kmtore, so
believe ; and now Guvmentouse only invites the
Town Hall to grass-parties and come-one-come-all
shivoos of a high official nature. The saintly
Governor Buxton is understood to have said, in a
chastened tone of voice, that he expects to arrive
in Adelaide about October, and that he will be
glad to attend the Y.M.C. A. festival on any date
after Nov. 6. What a cheerful prospect for every-
body who is not a tea-and-toast-blue-ribbon
brigadier 1 Though society may extract some
grains of comfort from the reflection that Gov.
.Buxton, to whom the S. A. saints cry “ All hail!”
won’t be at home to the Y.M.C.A. until after
Nov. 6. Melbourne Cup is run on the 5th —which
looks as if Gov. Buxton knew a thing or two,
after all.
And it appears that N.S. Wales’ own Hampden
has been selling his unearned increment by lumps
lately, and is reported to have vended one of his
estates to the tune of =£2500, exclusive of timber-
money—for the trees went too. The total doesn’t
seem such a deal in Australia—it would have been
smiled at as a flea-bite before the boom. But a
Gov. who sells his trees before starting doesn’t
sound a promising young man—it even detracts
from his pedigree, for it looks as though, were his
family - tree honest timber, he would dicker
that, too ! Of course, it may not mean anything
particularly ominous, but 1 get all my ideas from
novels which always drop into a subdued minor
key when the duke turns his timber into faggots.
Talking of earls and governors, a London paper
has this to say of the lately-created Earl of Wen-
dover, alias Lord Carington : “The train was a
little tardy in bringing the royal saloon to just
the proper level with the personages awaiting it,
and this appeared to throw Lord Carington into
an agony, for he approached our royals with bows
of apology that jerked just like an old box-lid
shuts up when jumped upon, I never saw an
Englishman convulsed with such bows before.
The duke himself seemed quite sorry for his lord-
ship, and held out a pitying and consolatory hand,
but that only sent Lord Carington off into a fresh
spinal contortion.’’ It is significant that all this
happened before our ex-Gov. became an Earl.
The projected arrival in Sydney of Mrs. Rear-
Admiral Bridge will make Admiralty House more
commonplace—same old hostess looking as if forced
into facial amiability with a glove-stretcher and
all that. Hitherto, a visit to “North Shore”
Bridge had a piquant flavor of possible impropriety
—just the sort of mere suggestion which one has
while lunching with a bachelor who has no social
right to give woman-parties, but who gives ’em
all the same. Grass-widower Bridge’s dances and
dinners and grass-parties, without the suspicion
of a lady to drive the host in bit and bridle, were
at least uncommon.
An exhibition of fancy dancing will-be given at
the Masonic Hall, Castlereagh-street, Sydney, on
the, 23rd., by the youthful pupils of Miss Scott,
the fashionable dancing - mistress of Petersham.
The proceeds arising from the sale of tickets (at
2s. and Is.) ate to go in aid of the distressed poor
of Sydney-, who badly want all the assistance
they can get. The Acting - Governor and
Lady Dailey are patrons, and tickets can be
bought from Alderman R. Fowler, Alderman
J. W, Johnston, Messrs. Frank Grimley, Quong
Tart, J. H. Roseby, J.P., or from the Benevolent
Society.
1 regret to hear that Madame Enriquez, the
popular contralto of the Esty-Marsh Co., has
fallen on evil times financially, and so am pleased
at the action of a number of Sydney ladies who
are organising a farewell benefit concert to take
place early this month. It is good to know, also,
that Arthur Deane has got over his illness—he
has now gone Santley-wards with =£200 in his
pocket, proceeds of his big benefit concert.
Yours affectionately,
Sappho Smith.
Quietly browsing in one of the St. Alban’s
paddocks are two ostriches. The hen-bird last
summer laid twenty odd eggs, each about the size
of a football. Her ladyship used to sit on these
during the daytime, but was relieved at sundown
by her male companion. The outcome of their
patience was one “chick,” and Leslie Macdonald
lias serious thoughts of “ breaking him in.” When
the eggs were freslt, the Japanese servants wanted
to dress one to send to “Bill’’Forester at Warwick
Farm, whose performance on eggs stuffed with
force-meat and cayenne had astonished them far
more than the war with China.
An effort is being made to collect a sum
of money to provide for the medical treatment in
London of Mr. M. W. Bayliss, a young Sydney
journalist and litterateur of great promise. An
obscure nervous disease (the result of a surgical
injury in childhood) with which he was afflicted
lias resulted in partial paralysis, and he is thus
incapacitated from any kind of active work. Dr,
Victor Horsley, the eminent London specialist,
has promised to take his case in hand, and there
is e ery reason to believe that a special course of
treatment would result in the cure or alleviation
of his trouble. Funds are urgently required to
defray the cost of Mr. Bayliss’ voyage to and
from London, and all donations for that purpose
will Vie thankfully received by Mr. Walter Bethel,
of the N.S.W, Department of Public Instruction,
or Mr. John Haslam, architect, Exchange Corner,
Pitt-street, Sydney.
With the beginning of the really cold
weather in Melbourne it is strange to see the lead-
ing drapery houses sacrificing their winter goods
to make room for an early show of Spring fashions.
Such is the case, however; and it is marvellous
this winter to note the extreme manner in which
the prices of articles which one would have
thought would just be in the greatest demand—
such as furs, sealskin jackets, winter mantles,
dress stuffs, &c. —are reduced at Messrs, Hicks,
Atkinson & Sons’ establishment in Oollins-street,
during thei. existing stock-taking sale.
SPORTING NOTIONS.
About a month ago a secret meeting of serious
and comparatively sober Melb. bookmakers was held, for
the purpose of discussing the tolalisator movement and
its chances of success. Firstly it was moved, seconded
and carried unanimously that the tote would be disastrous
to the odds-laying profession, whereupon the meeting
resolved itself into a committee of ways and means to
prevent the accursed machine from coming into force.
Very little time was wasted in considering the feasibility
of defeating a Bill in the Assembly. A strong majority
for the tote in the Lower 'Ouse was assumed. Several
reports as to the feeling of the Council were then sub-
mitted. These showed that, whereas the pious element
might he depended on to vote for Ikey Mo “on principle"
as before, the worldly members, who represent a majority,
are either strongly in favor of the machine or still open
to argument. Also, the evidence with regard to these
latter was so alarming that the committee decided upon
prompt action. A substantial sum of nibney was guar-
anteed in the room, delegates were appointed to devote a
lot of their valuable time to reasoning with the doubtful
members who hold the balance of power, and further
donations to the fund (in the event of its being found
necessary to spend more money in anti-tote literature,
etc.) were promised by the wealthiest bookmakers pre-
sent. The committee of ways and means adjourned with
a light heart, confident that the Vic. Leg. Council ’will
ultimately throw out theTotalisator Bill on moral grounds.
A bookmaking political forecast is not necessarily sound,
but the facts of the case are as written, and if Victorian
property-owners wish to deliver their representatives
from Hebrew temptation, they must call upon them to
state their views without further delay.
* • • *
Atari anti-totemeetingin Melbourne, “machine-
less” N.S. Wales was pointed to as the Australian pro-
vince where racing most flourished. The fact, however,
is that racing in every Australasian province not using
the tolalisator is, and has been, retrograding fast, N;S.
Wales, next to Victoria, being the mosldeplorable object-
lesson. The A.J.C., V.R.C., and V.A.T.C. are reducing
stakes and losing revenue and entries, whilst most of the
outside clubs in both provinces are well-nigh insolvent.
In S. Australia,yvhere the tote is operating, the reverse is
the case. Racfwg flourishes, stakes are increasing, good
odds are current, the bookmaker nuisance is almost
obliterated, a substantially increased club and provincial
revenue is obtained, and a practically idle class of mea
is driven to more useful occupation.
Compare the A.R.C., S.A.J.C., and Onkapa-
ringa meetings with the A.J.C., V.R.C., and V. A.T.C. hig
events of a few years ago ; then contrast them to-day, and
an overwhelming advantage will be found to rest with the
clubs using totes as regards atakes-entries and club
revenue.
The tote is a racing-tonic, the bookmaker a
poison.

The sensational horse of the ’95 Grand National
was undoubtedly Bill. After winning a flat-race at
Mentone, he was made favorite for the National Hurdle.
Then he ran nearly last in the Caulfield Hurdle, won by
Emmalea, and consequently receded in the betting. Only
a week later, he came out at Williamstown and won the
Hurdle comfortably, and was once more re-installed as
favorite for the National. The next iriove was that he
was to be auctioned, and he was knocked down at
300 guineas. The final sensation was on the day of the race,
when the pen was run through Bill’s name—and the
gentle public was once more “ in the soup.”
Ifwas freely rumored on National Hurdle day
that the owner of Emmalea and the purchaser of Bill
were one. That would be one way of getting rid of a
dangerous opponent—buying him. By the way, the
reputed owner of Emmalea is a bookmaker, but, by way of
variation, is a Gentile. The first time for a long period
that the Chosen succumbed ; and, to make it more bitter,
tiie taker-down was one of their own profesh.
The National Hurdle makes Emmalea ’s fifth
consecutive win in about the same number of weeks.
What a regular little gold-mine she must have been 1
Baltoro, who although he only won the Maiden
Steeple by a neck, could easily have made it a dozen
lengths, promises to have a say in the finish of the
National Steeple, in which he is weighted at 9st. 101 b.
On track-form the National Steeple should go
to last year’s winner, Daimio. He is jumping splendidly,
and in a recent go on the flat, over three miles, he beat
Chesterman, who not so long ago beat Patron over the
same distance in Sydney.
But this paper plumps for Baltoro as the one
most likely to give punters a sustained thrill for their
money in the G.N. Steeplechase. Baltoro’s maiden per- 1
formance in the Maiden Steeple last Saturday was some-
thing worth considering. He jumped like a cat, and won
with ridiculous ease. It is true that the sprightly Bal-
larat nag will have to travel a mile further at the same
pace on Saturday. Judging from appearances after the
maiden race he can do it, for he then seemed ready to
gallop the course over again. A safe jumper, in fine
condition, who has just won a public trial at the first
time of asking, and is receiving two and three stone from
the other proved good ones, must be a rational tip. Fear-
less 11. won the Grand Nat. as easily as he had won the
Maiden Steeple a week before, and Baltoro may do like-
wise—
B altoro should win if he’s able to stay,
A nd doesn’t grow weary, or fall by the way ;
L ittle he lacks in the mat ter of muscle,
T aylor has got him wound up for the tussle ;
O thers may find him a trifle too fast i
R ounding the turn, when all dangers are past—
O r, perhaps, poor Baltoro will stagger home last.

There was practically nothing in the G.N,
Hurdle struggle beyond Bischoff and the winner.
Bischoff, who was primed with brandy before he went
out, ran brilliantly for two miles seven furlongs, whereat
he finished pulling and was done. Then Brewer took
Emmalea to the front, and the race was all over.

Mr. “Sam” Fielder has done so well himself
over other people’s cast-offs that he cannot grumble at
anyone taking a fall out of him at the same game. King
Orry, who so often disappointed his hackers about Sydney,
has won races since passing out of Fielder’s hands, and at
Saturday’s V.R.C. Grand National meeting just missed
winning the Winter Handicap, The Admiral beating him
by a length.

The football-match, N.S.W. v. Queensland, on
Sydney Cricket Ground last Saturday, was not a football-
match but a football spree. From the start it looked as
if the home men had put their best lot in the held,
and the Bananalanders had sent their worst. At half-
time the most serious intellect among the 9000 spectators
began to realise that Sydney would probably win—the
score being then 17 to 0. The refreshment interval
brought little change. The Sydney team looked calm,
and the visitors desperate. At 4.30 p.m., the score was
Sydney 30 to 0. At 4.40 Wickham wasstill going through
the visitors with a sliding, gliding, dodgy, deceptive
motion like lightning down a greased track ; and at 4.50
Abbott made a wild hull charge which proved a perfect
paralyser. At 5.2 p.m., when play ceased, the game was
39-3.

Melb. F.O. narrowly escaped defeat on Satur-
day, having one goal to Williamstown’s two at three-
quarter time, and Just managing to squeeze on two more
before the finish. All things considered, they ought to
go down before Geelong on 27th, if only on account of the
latter’s three star goal-kickers.
* • * *
To keep up the interest in the sick game Gee-
long doesn't meet Melb. until the end of July. The Red-
iegs haven’t been premiers since ’76 and Geelong since
’B6. It's one or the other this season/ Essendon,the
four years’premiers, can hardly rake up a team. There
are fresh deserters every week—mostly gone to Westralia.

At Sydney Athletic Club last Saturday night,
Peter Felix boxed Tom Ball a ten-round contest. Felix
is a tall, sinewy gentleman of color, very like Peter Jack-
son; Ball is a much shorter, very thick-set pug., and
second-mate of the ship Blythswood, lately in from Rio.
Sea captains and sailors mustered in numbers to see
“ Tom ” add another win to his list of 23 victories ; many
young and old Sydney amateur and professional boxers
were aiound ; and once the match began several asses in
the audience went mad with excitement and deafened
everyone with their din. The grinning black’s great
woolly head towered over his sturdier and heavier
opponent, who seemed nervous, though his face wore
an ugly scowl. The sailor rushed on to the
nigger’s glove, and after a few rushes and
punches on the nose the Britisher seemed to have
had enough, but bis Seconds kept him at it. In the
third round he pulled off his glove and said he had had
enough, hut his seconds assured him that he hadn t been
hit yet, whereupon he resumed. “The poor fellow,’’re-
marked a pro. boxer of him, “ he diinno anything about
it.” As a matter of fact, the white man was quite un-
scienced, and hadn’t the sense or the pluck to rush, give
and take, and make a real hard match of it. The
darkey never regarded the thing seriously. Smiling
all the time, he would take two minutes to get his man
into the corner of the ring, and when he had him there,
and the “ poor fellow ” stooped and covered his face with
his hands, the good-humored black stepped back into the
middle of the ring and let his foe run out unharmed. The
referee’s award went to Felix.

Wreak, on guilty necks not only,
Vengeance which is not the Lord’s,
Help us, O Lord !
When the goddess, she of Justice,
Tears the bandage from her eyes^ 1
Seeing naught but condemnation,
Innocence unto thee cries,
Spare us, O Lord !
When for hangman and for gallows,
Judges seek a hasty prey ;
When a man is brought to trial
In a foregone-Verdict way,
Be merciful, O Lord !

The Bulletin receives regularly a letter
from a N.S.W. Government Department. Its
object is to state that the department encloses a
certain printed return which has to be sent out by
dozens to nearly all the papers in the land. It is
written on a very large sheet of thick paper with
a wide margin, an engraved headline, and a coat-
of-arms. A copperplate individual has nearly
covered the big sheet with writing in order to
state that he encloses the obscure document in
question. It is initialled by an expensive official,
and signed by another expensive official on behalf
of a third expensive official. Also, there is an
intimation in the corner that all correspondence
arising out of this letter is to be addressed to the
Under-Secretary, and marked No. 175/875,369.
And yet the country wants to retrench the public
service, when it has things like this weighing on
its mind.

Dear Bulletin, —The killing by sharks of
a Japanese pearl-diver in Barrow Passage, W.A.,
reported in Sydney papers of June 4, is the first
incident of the kind on record. I remember, some
years ago, standing on the deck of a schooner
lying at anchor in Torres Straits. A diver was
engaged in putting some copper on the bottom of
the vessel. I saw a lot of sharks about and men-
tioned the fact to the man (a kanaka) when he
came up for some more metal. “ That’s all right,”
he remarked, “shark all-ee-time frightened wind
from helmet.” He shortly afterwards went down
again, and I saw a shark go quite close to him.
Billy bobbed his head and the air-bubbles went
towards the shark, which immediately swam away.
Again, after the hurricane of April, ’B7, on the
N. VV. coast of W.A., divers cleared out the stores,
&c., from the hold of a sunken schooner, and they
stated that innumerable sharks were about. In
the old days, when aboriginals were employed as
naked divers on the W.A. coast, attacks by
sharks were numerous, but since the introduction
of the diving-apparatus no accident from this
source has occurred. Honest George.

The Leader has the ingenious assurance
to declare that its reduction in price has enor-
mously increased its circulation, which “now far
exceeds that of any metropolitan weekly in Aus-
tralia.’’ If the term “metropolitan weekly”
means a newspaper belonging solely to one
metropolis, the poor old Leader is welcome to the
distinction, although its circulation is notglaringly
apparent in Melbourne.
Dora Russell, in “The Drift of Fate,”
now running in a Melb. daily, convicts a man of
murder on evidence none of which would be
admissible in a law court. In like manner,
Marion Crawford, in one of his books, upsets a
millionaire’s will because the executor is left a
legacy, whereas it is only a witness to a will who
can’t be a beneficiary ; and the only thing that
would happen if a witness were left something
would be that he wouldn’t get it.

A Wonderful Cure.
Herb Rassmussen. . August, 1894.
Dear Sir,—ln the year of 18711 was eight days in the water sheep-
washing, and contracted rheumatism and stiffness in the joints, and
have tried all advertised medicines. When I came to Sydney 1 had a
great difficulty in walking, and went to the Turkish baths, which did
no good. Passing your window I saw a testimonial from Mr. Jt. W.
O’Sullivan M.P., with the same complaint as I had, which led me to
try vour Remedies, On Thursday before Good Friday I took the first
of your Pills; since then I have used 4 boxes Special Powerful Alfahne
Vitality Pills, 3 boxes Special Powerful Alfaline Rheuniat.c Pills, with
Liver and Kidney Pills, and free use of your Alfaline Eucalyptus Oil,
and lam now, with the blessing of God, as well in health as I was 23
years ago. I can with great confidence recommend your Remedies to
anyone suffering from the same complaint. May you long be spared
under God to be a blessing to suffering humanity.
I remain, dear sir, yours very gratefully, JUliiN KltA Jf.

Ayer’s Sarsaparilla
did for the Invalid Daughter of a Prom-

“My daughter had for a long time been
troubled with violent headaches and sleep-
lessness. She was pale, had no appetite,
and was losing flesh rapidly. She took
various remedies for her trouble, but re-
ceived no benefit until she commenced using
Ayer’s Sarsaparilla. After taking half a
bottle, she began to feel better. l?y a con-
tinued use of this medicine, her appetite re-
turned, her cheeks began to fill out and show
color, she gained in strength, her headaches
disappeared, she slept better, and now says
she feels like a new person.”—F. F. Cogges-

“ it is with heartfelt grati-
tude I write to tell you of the
great benefit my little daugh-
ter Gladya has derived from
‘Benger's Food.' The doctor
and all who saw her thought
we should never he able to
rear her. We took her tothe
hospital, and the authori-
ties recommended ' Benger's
Food.’ From that time she
began to pick up flesh and
strength."
“ If every mother knew of

A Morning Song .
[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
While laughter lingers on our lips
And lightens in our sparkling eyes,
And life is full of bright surprise,
Whv take our joy in timid sips,
And find, too late, that Chronos grips
The falterer’s throat ?
If what we hold for truth be lies,
No matter ! They for us are truth.
The glorious anarchy of youth
Must fail when later cares arise ;
We know not what before us lies—
Nor care a groat.
Too early yet to say “ We’ve sinned !”
All sorts of trifles please us now ;
The rustling of a leafy bough
Of bamboo, creaking in the wind,
Makes finer music than is dinned
From church or chapel.
We have a legacy, ’tis said,
Of sin and death, from one who tore
The veil of darkness hung before
By God, and gave us light instead.
We can’t go straight since Eve was led
To eat an apple.
So be it, Mother Eve ! We’ll bear
The brunt, and all the burden take,
And love your daughters, for your sake,
As long as they are sweet and fair ;
The legacy we’ll gladly share
With them, dear madam.
What matter if the tale be true
Or false ? We care not in the least;
But, in the middle of the feast
Of life, we’ll drain a glass or two
Of twenty-overproof to you
And good old Adam.

Early in the winter Miss Ruby Madden was trying to
get a hunter. I hope she found one safe enough for a
beginner, yet fast enough to maintain the family honor in
the field.
It is really a horse that is referred to?

An Apolloesque Vic. youth has done a
brave thing. He went to Maoriland and there
secured a bride of the most advanced description.
The lady smokes, cycles, and wears “ rational ”
garb on all occasions, and intends, so she says, to
“boost the New Woman movement in Melb. all
she knows.” The beauteous youth’s friends
already begin to feel apprehensive on his behalf,
although the honeymoon is but three weeks old.
Nervous sufferers will find it worth their
while to peruse Herr Rassmussen’s advt. on page

The Ag*b on the recent case of embracery:
“Judges, jurymen, and officers of the colonial
courts have always stood above suspicion.” Sweet
unction! Furthermore: “In every instance
where the crime of embracery has been attempted
it has been promptly denounced, and its instiga-
tors severely punished.” In every instance ! Om-
niscient David ! The Melb. juries may not be
quite as “ rotten ” as the Melb. packed benches—
hut, all the same, there are men in Melbourne who
get their living as jury-squarers.

THE EARL OF GARRICK
Has successfully tried “ Homocea.” Writing
from Mount Juliet, Thomastown, he says:—
“It is the most wonderful stuff I ever came
across. Please send me three boxes. I gave
some to a labourer of mine who had a bad boil
on his leg, and was quite lame. I saw him after
four days, and asked him what the “ Homocea ”
did.for him. He said he was entirely cured ; his
wife, besides, had had a pain in her elbow, so
that she could not bend her arm for a year, and
it cured that. I also gave some to a woman with
> a.bad leg, and it is doing her good."
Instantly
Toadies I lie SPOT
Afflicted with Neuralgia, Lumbago, Pa-
ralysis, Convulsions, Bruises, Strained
Muscles, Pains in the Joints, Aches and
Sprains, Eczema, Burns, Tooth-ache,
Face-ache, Chilblains, Boils, Ulcers,
Stings, Chaps, Back-ache, Twinges, and
all kindred ills and complaints.
H
You need not put off your canter
for the sake of a premonitory cold,
with Homocea as a protector.
A cold begins with inflammation of the membra
neous lining of the intricate little passages of the
nsse (which is a Hampton Court labyrinth on a
snail scale). Homocea at once subdues the in
fl animation by reducing the swelling, and thereby
relieving the feeling of “stuffiness.” Moreover, it
firms a protective covering for the delicate mem
brane, and prevents cold air, or other irritating
vapour from getting at it. In influenza, Homocea
acts in the same way, and here the germ-killing
properties of the ointment further come into play,
Not much is known about the way in which mfiu
enza originates, but it is quite clear that it is caused
by an invisible germ or microbe of some kind.
Homoceamay,therefore, be confidently recomended
both as a cure and a preventive of influenza.
HOMOCEA v. RINGWORM CURED.
Hoylake, 19 Aug., 1893.
“Dear Sirs,—l want to thank you for that
wonderful preparation, * Homocea,' which we
use for about everything; but lately my little girl
had a bad ringworm on the head, and my doctor
said her hair would have to be cut close. But I
preferred using the ‘ Homocea,’ and in four days
it was quite well, and the doctor said I ought to
give you a testimonial, and I think so too.—
Yours truly. “ M. Aldred."
LADY Keane has much pleasure in recom-
mending Homocea as an invaluable remedy for
rheumatism, cuts, bruises, piles, sprains, &c. ;
she thinks so highly of it that she would not be
without it in the house, as it has entirely cured
her of rheumatism and other ailments. She can
also testify tothehealing propertiesof *‘Hippacea’
for stable use.—Hillside, Bracknell, Bucks.

I Don’t Go Shearing Now: A Wool-
Sited Story .
[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
So you’re off to Riveriua, where the sun is shining
clear,
And the ewes and lambs are bleating, calling
shearers far and near ;
Where the musterers are busy and the grass is
waving high,
And the July fogs are climbing up the sunbeams
to the sky ;
Where the trefoil and the crowfoot in the pens
are growing rank,
And the mud is getting sun-cracked on the falling
river’s bank ;
Where the cook is in possession and the teams are
carting wood,
And they’re patching up the oven—which was
never understood—
And the carpenters are fixing up the gates and
pens and bins,
While the pressers, just to kill time, press in bales
the winter’s skins.
And those cranky little grindstones, in the centre
hollow-ground,
How they used to jump and wobble as you turned
the handles round !
Has the boss stuck to bis promise, putting new
ones in their place,
Not too soft and not too gritty, broad and level
on the face?
I’ve been there, you know, my sonny, and I know
exactly how
Those grindstones hurt your feelings—though I
don’t go shearing now.
And you’ll travel to the shearing, up across the
open plain,
Through the salt and blue-bush country, and
you’ll camp one night again
On the sand-hills at the Eight-mile, where the
grass is always fine, '
And you’ll talk of last year’s shearing as you
sniff the burning pine
Which you know will spoil the damper, but you’ll
never care a D.
(Though you hate the taste of resin and the ashes
in your tea),
For a shearer on the travel isn’t fool enough to
miss
Decent cropping for the horses for a trifle such as
this.
Then with saddle for a breakwind and your oil-
cloth tucked in well,
You will listen for the tinkling of the little tin-
pot bell
And the “ prad’s ” persistent cropping out towards
the Old-man tank,
And you’ll fall asleep contented as you hear the
hobbles clank.
Every day you’ll draw still nearer to the summer
further north
Leaving winter’s Cold behind you, till the sweet
Spring bursting forth
In all her glistening glory, fills your soul with
wondrous joy,
And you want to cheer the sunshinei—l’ve been
there, you know, my boy—
And you sing and shout with gladness, never
oaring when or how :
Ah, I know the way it takes you—though I don’t
go shearing now.
You’ll be wond’ring what old faces will be missing
from the shed,
For some are shearing elsewhere, and some, per-
haps, are dead.
And each succeeding muster you will notice, with
a sigh,
That some, old friends are missing—and you
vaguely wonder why.
And where they’re shearing this year. Ah, I
know exactly how
These little things affect you—though I don’t go
shearing now.
Three clear days, if fairly lucky, you’ll be there
before the “ roll,”
And the glory of the Spring-time will suffuse your
youthful soul,
So ’xnong the soft, sweet grasses you will lie and
lolhabout,
And yoh’ir greet each fresh arrival with a recog-
nising shout:
“Hang your saddles on the tie-beams; get some
rushes for your bunk;
You will find some down the river, where the
steamer’s barge was sunk.”
You will pay an early visit to the dear old shed,
I’ll bet-
Perhaps upon your own old stand the oil-rag’s
lying yet;
And you’ll wander up and down the silent board
with heart quite full,
As you spiff old recollections in the smell of
greasy wool.
Ah, my lad, you needn’t smile, because I know
exactly how
These little things affect you—though I don’t go
shearing now.
Then the start!—you’re all excitement as you
slowly feel your way,
And there isn’t any hurry, as it takes you all the
day
To get the “sweet-lips” going, and the boss
severely damns
The mercenary “mouser ” who opens out on rams,
For- all are strangely awkward while the hands are
getting in,
And it spoils a good beginning if you chop both
wool and skin.
But the next day things have altered, and the
short, hoarse, “ Wool away ! ”
Replaces reminiscent jokes and latest “ leary ”
lay;
The learners awkward struggling, at which all
hands had laughed,
Forgotten is as silently you settle down to graft—
Each man his neighbor watching, noting each the
other’s pace,
As you move a little faster, feeling fitter for the
race.
If you find from those about you that you’re
gaining more and more,
Then you take to watching others, faster men
along the floor;
And as the speed grows greater, you will find that
not a few
Are anxiously, discreetly, on the quiet, watching
you.
So the pace goes on increasing, and the sweat
begins to drop,
Every man has found his pacer and is going at
his top;
But ere many days are over weak ones fall back
one by one
Hit by chips and bullets flying from the boss’s
little gun;
I’ve been there, you know, my sonny, and I
know exactly how
The fight gets fairly started —though I don’t go
shearing now.
Then in crowded huts at night-time, drinking tea
and rigging “ tongs,”
Playing poker, crib, or euchre, telling yarns, or
singing songs.]}
Men are there from cold Monaro, “ cockatoos
from further down,
Men from Maoriland and Tassy, men from every
smoky town;
Men from far beyond the Darling, some from even
further west,
All have something fresh to talk of, and all do
their level best —
Tales of love and hate romantic, some perhaps of
shady birth;
All the latest songs and dances, open-hearted,
honest mirth.
As a man each man is treated, black legs always
in the stew;
When a man belies his manhood, he will generally
rue.
That’s the style; you see I’m posted (though no
union was around
In the days when I went shearing, but I always
got the “ pound ”), . , . „
And I know the shearers temper, and can tell
exactly how
They would scorn a traitor’s action —though 1
don’t go shearing now.
Shedwards silent figures flitting in the dawning
cold and gray,
Then a rush at ringing signal, all together— fare
aw ay! . ' . . ~ „
Labored breathing, bodies straining, painfully you
turn and twist,
Small blows first, then open wider as the stiffness
leaves your wrist.
There’s the flying hurry-scurry up and down the
greasy floors
Of the pickers and the broomies; there’s the bang-
ing of the doors,
And the rattle of the wool-press, with its “ hard
metallic din,”
And the hoof-taps on the battens when the ewes
and lambs rush in.
“ Wool away !” and “Tar !” and “ Sheep-ho !
sundry growls at clumsy boys—
Are excluded from the rule of “No unnecessary
noise.”
Ever constant, ever struggling, straining o’er
th’ astonished brutes,
Too surprised to raise a protest till they’re shorn
and down the shoots.
Three smart rubs with well-oiled turkey, dab the
shears in water-pot,
Rush away to catch another —thus doth rage the
battle hot;
While the perspiration, streaming from the ringer
as he swings
Round the “jumbuck” in a circle, splashes on
the board in rings.
Smoke-ho ! Sharpen ; cobble drivers; file your
knockers down at night;—
Off again with rush and rattle, shear-blades buried
out of sight
’Neath the snowy fleeces falling, tumbling o’er
like crests of foam—
Ah, my lad ! ’tis little wonder that you love to
northward roam
When the battle is beginning; for I know exactly
how
Such a fight affects your feelings—though I don’t
go shearing now.
Then on Sundays, when the waving grass is kissed
by breezes warm,
And the clicking shears are silent, there are
duties to perform.
Sitting round the sunny wood-heap, perjuring im-
mortal souls
With tall tales of harvest prowess, while you rinse
your greasy moles.
There’s your shears to put in order, and a line to
write to Joe
(Who, you hear, is mates with Clancy, shearing
at the Overflow);
And another to a sweetheart —write this slowly
and with care,
Spelling audibly and using rounded phrases choice
and rare;
But you spoil no end of paper ere you get that
letter fixed,
Eor, somehow, Love’s soft language with the shear-
ing slang gets mixed.
You have news to tell in plenty, but she’d hardly
understand,
So you cut it short by hoping she’ll excuse your
shaky hand.
I’ve been there myself, my sonny, and I know
precisely how
All these little things affect you—though I don’t
go shearing now.
How I’d love to travel with you where the Mur-
rumbidgee flows,
Where the days are bright and sunny, where the
noisy quorking crows
Are flying round the wash-pen, and the sweating-
pens are full—
Like to have some tea and brownie and to smell
the greasy wool.
Every year I get a longing, as the shearing time
draws nigh,
To saddle up and slither, and to have another try
At the game I loved so dearly ; but that pleasure
is denied,
Eor the missus made me promise I would let the
shearing slide.
Yes, the missus made me promise—and she knows
exactly how
| The rheumatism takes me—so I don’t go shearing
now.

Dismal.
[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
The sun was sinking again over the great lonely
bush when Ned, Steve, and Tommy Masterton
scrambled up from the hell-holes of Cattle Gully.
They had ridden all day without seeing a single
hoof. The track out was steep and rough, so they
dismounted on the range and eased the horses.
The wind moaned drearily through the trees,
and all the elements of the slumbering bush
awakened into revelry.
“ We can’t go home empty-handed,” said'Ned
Masterton, “so let us steer through Boogee, and
take a sheep from Dismal’s yard. I’ll go in and
keep him company while the two of you work the
yard—then meet me at the lower hurdles.”
Dismal was an out-shepherd on the station.
The sheep-yard stood on a stony ridge at the foot
of the range, and the shepherd’s hut was close by.
“Jack,” the dog, barked, and Ned Masterton
appeared.
“Wull, Ned,” said Dismal, as the other
squatted in the ashes beside the fire—“ Wh’r’
been th’ day?”
“ Over in th’ gully—after cattle.”
“ So —be many there ?”
“ Plenty tracks.”
“ So—but hoi’ thee till I sling th’ billy.” And
the shepherd began raking the fire together.
“Darn thay—carn’t thee sit straight?” he con-
tinued, talking to the billy which he was fixing on
the fire, and then, turning to his visiter as he
brought forth the tea and sugar-bags—
“ The shugger as they've fetched —(pauses)—
thought I ’eard a rush, darn but I did—th’ shugger
as they’ve fetched me—(pauses again)—didst thee
’ear enerthun, Ned ?”
“No, ’ceptin’ th’ wind.”
“ Wull, darn me-if it ain’t simply- walkin’ clean
’live w’ grubs, thet swims on th’ top o’ th’ billy
like they ol’ yoes wots bogged in th’ dam out yon.”
The billy soon boiled; and when Dismal had
skimmed the grubs which he complained of from
off the tea with a chip, Masterton helped himself
to a pintful and to some damper and salt-junk
produced from the camp-oven. Then, thinking
the coast clear, he said good-night, and Dismal
heard the rattle of the horse’s hoofs as he cantered
away.
Next morning. The first streaks of grey dawn
broke over the ridges and were floating down on
to the timbered hollows. “Thinks w’ better let
on of ’em go, an’ feed ’em t’ th’ long moun’n th’
day.”
The shepherd spoke to the dog, which looked up
into his face as though he understood the lingo
exactly.
The hurdles were taken down, and Jaok headed
the flock towards the mountain.
The air rang with the merry notes of birds. The
hermit, with his dumb companion at his heels,
sauntered slowly forth—his hands behind his back.
The sun broke over the mountain.
Suddenly Jack darted off to where some crows
were hopping about on the ground near the foot
of an iron-bark tree. He sniffed at the spot,
looked up at the squawking birds now in the tree,
then stared back meaningly at his master. Dismal
advanced to the place, where, partially covered
over with a few dry sticks, was the head and in-
testines of a sheep. He stood for a few moments
and gazed on heap—his hands still locked
behind him.
Jack looked up as if waiting for his master to
speak. Then the man’s mind seemed to wander,
and he spoke slowly.
“ In—them—gone—days—Jack, y’ wuz —tran-
sported— fer Wull, wull—an’ this wuz y’ game,
Mister Ned I I ’eard ’em rush, too !—but’t won’t
do, me shaver, ’t won’t do !”
He turned the gory head over with the toe of
his boot and reflected again.
“ Had y’ tol’ me y’ wuz s’ clean out—y’ could —
y’ could ! —yes, a dozen on ’em had y’ liked, an’
they would neverer knowd as it wuzn’t th’ nater
dogs, but ter ” —(he turned and shook his head) —
“ter come in the night an’ steal ’em—’t won’t
wash, ’t won’t wash !”
But the sheep were spreading, and the shepherd
with his dumb companion turned to round them
up, and to wait and watch for the end of another
day in the weird and sleepy bush.
Q-
STEELE RUDD.
Spoofed: A Town Tale.
[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
The eminent specialist, Doctor X Z (late phy-
sician to H.R.H. the Emperor of Rumtifoo, and
other august but remote potentates) had failed, in
spite of lavish advts. (“on the nod ”) to convince
sufferers that ill worth of his advice and medicine
would restore even an Egyptian mummy to
vigorous health. One bright hope remained.
He had reason to believe that a German drug
firm, on his six months’ bill, would execute the
big order he had sent them for saleable drugs.
The firm’s letter had arrived. Its bulkiness
suggested bills of lading, and the doctor sits back
complacently, opens it, and reads :
Sir,—We have your order for goods amounting to £6OO,
for which we enclose invoice as well as the report we
have received respecting your commercial and moral
standing. On receipt of cash, goods shall be shipped.—
Yours, &c., F. and 00.
The “report” read: “A thorough sooandrel.
Cash before delivery only,” It was an original,
and the “society’s ” name was writ large thereon.
Now, the society was “good for anything,” and
the “ doctor ” was certain that he had done
nothing particularly queer (that anyone knew
about) for the last few years—since he came from
Brisbane, indeed. Here was his chance. A big
claim for damages. He rushed off to the Protec-
tion Society.
“ Are you the manager? ” enquired the doctor.
“Yes. Be seated,” replied the brass-faced
trade-protective gent.
“ Sir! You here say that I am a thorough
scoundrel! ” (This very loud and threateningly.)
“So I see, sir. Well? ” (Very calmly.)
“ Well / I demand .£5OOO damages.”
“ That’s far too little, my dear . Let’s
see, what’s your name now ? ”
“My name is Doctor XZ —and always has
been.”
“Capital name, my dear doctor. You don t
remember me, I see ? ”
“No, sir, but you’ll have cause to remember
me soon.”
“I do already. But surely you recollect when
we were in St. Helena together. Let’s see ; you
had five ‘stretch,’ I think, and I had two ‘hard.’
Wasn’t that it ? ”
“Eh? What? I don’t recollect you. What
were you in for ? ” (Confidentially.)
“ Oh, never mind, my dear doctor. You’re all
right.” (Heartily.)
“ You know, if I’d known you were a pal, I
wouldn’t have bothered. Oorneanavadrink.
And so they had.
B.B.
“For Ever and Ever."
In the cold, grey dawn I sit up and look at the
woman by my side. One soft white hand peeps
out from the dainty lace, and on one finger is a
gold ring. There is just such another upon my
own finger; and these two rings bind us to one
another for ever and ever. And lam tired
already.
She moves in her sleep, and buries her face
deeper in the heavy folds of the bed-clothes. ' The
little hand is still out, and lies so near me (so
temptingly near, as I should have thought only a
little while ago) that I can trace the faint blue
lines in it as I have done many a time before.
But now . . . how horrible it all seems !
She stirs again, and draws the hand into the
lace so that it is almost hidden. How pretty she
looks! . • . with her silky brown hair. Ah,
why do I find it so difficult to think of her, even
when she is before my eyes thus ? Why do I
never think of her when she is absent? Why do
great masses of tumbling black hair come into
my mind, while I watch this soft brown tangle on
the pillow before me ? I have cried to beat down
these thoughts—but they will come . . . and
how can I help myself ?
Look at her neck—how white it is ! And yet—
and yet why does a warm brown something con-
tinually haunt me? A living something which
brings with it the sun, the sky, and the sea ?
Our boy sleeps in a little room adjoining. I
creep in and look at him. He is asleep, and has
curled himself up almost into a ball, with one tiny
fist in his mouth. I dare not move it to give him
more air, lest he should wake and cry out. As I
look a horrible feeling of loneliness comes over
me. . . He is her child . . . our child
. . . I creep back to bed. Thank Heaven her
eyes are shut! . . . Those eyes so solemn and
blue.
And in the morning she tells me a curious
dream she had last night. And this is it :
“ I dreamed that a dark woman with wonderful
black hair came and stood by our bed ; and,
stooping, put her arms about you and kissed you
passionately many times, smoothing your fore-
head with her hand. And I tried to cry out, but
could not from fear. And suddenly looking up,
she saw me watching her ; and her face grew hard
and cruel. And she came round and stood and
looked at me; and I trembled. And presently
taking hold of me, she tried to pull me out of bed,
but something held me down ; and she gave up,
and went and sat by the dull, cold grate, and
wept bitterly. And I felt sorry for her in spite
of all, because she had no one to comfort her as I
have ; and I got up to go to her. But the cruel
hard look crept back into her face—and then I
woke, and saw you, and the empty chair, and the
bright sunlight darting round the edges of the
blinds, and found it was only a dream.”
And what can I say ? . . . What can I do ?
. . . How can I help myself ? . . .
—“C.S.” in “ The Yellow Book.”
“Talleyrand was rich because he sojid those
who bought him.”
“He has only one fault. He has never
been stone-broke.”
It is not generally known that prisoners
on remand are brought from Darlinghurst Gaol to
Sydney suburban polioe-oourts on foot, “ Black
Maria ” being now used only for remands from the
Central and Water Police-courts. It is true that
the constable escorting can ride on the trains free
of charge, but prisoner’s fare must be paid.
Should tiie arrestee have the money he may employ
a cab and both may ride ; if not, both must walk,
as there is no fund from which to pay fare. It is
not unusual to see a constable linked to a prisoner
wending his way to the suburbs. Sometimes the
prisoner is handcuffed solus; more often, for
greater security, to the accompanyingofficer. - One
day last week, the writer saw a decent-looking
woman marched by a policeman from Darlinghurst
through the principal streets en route to a subur-
ban police-court. It seems impossible to lay the
ghost of old Botany Bay.
Dear Bulletin, —“ No man was ever
written down except by himself,” and I don’t
object to hard words. “Cornstalk” (does he
really hail from N.S.W.?) has something!*) say
about me, and his letter bears internal evidence
that he knows better. He says, “ Having failed
to get in for a Scotch constituency to the Com-
mons, having failed as an editor of the Labor
Elector, and as an agitator, a soldier, and in
various other capacities in Great Britain, of course
he is singularly well-adapted to run the province
of Victoria,” &c., &c. Perhaps you will allow
me to remark that as a soldier I had as good a
record as any man of my standing, and only
resigned my commission because I disapproved of
the Egyptian expedition ; that as an agitator I
succeeded in making Social Democracy a power in
England; that the Labor Elector was the
most successful labor paper of its time; that
when I stood for South Aberdeen, in 1892,
I polled the record independent labor vote
of the election against Liberal and Tory;
and that I have held many enviable posi-
tions and resigned them all voluntarily. Failure
is nothing to be ashamed of. It usually proves
one is before one’s time. ■ I did fail in establishing
an Independent Labor Party in Great Britain in
1888 (see Nineteenth Century for June of that
year), from which it appears that I was then seven
years before my time. I admit the soft impeach-
ment that my forbears were not all hewers of
wood and drawers of water, but don’t feel inclined
to apologise for or to conceal the fact. If your
correspondent thinks “ it is better to govern our-
selves, however badly,” than to accept help from
new-comers, he should be quite satisfied with the
present state of Victoria. But he is in a small
minority.—Yours, H. H. Champion, Melb.
[Victoria has been governed largely by new-
comers all along, and that is perhaps just the
reason why it doesn’t feel as if it could stand many
more of them at present. —Ed. B.]
