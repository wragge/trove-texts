PIERROTS HOUSE.
i.
A street that’s neither grand nor poor;
A number quite'unknown to fame ;
Stairs ; then a door without a name ;
Then lodgings where content is sure ;
An air of luring quietude ;
A littered table ; notes, and scraps
Of writing—poetry perhaps ;
Mirror and window panes smoke-blued ;
Pictures ; a shelf of books ; a tray
Of glasses, and a plate or two ;
Some silver old ; some journals new ;
Roses ; a dancing girl in clay ;
A shrine ; a bOret; one sabot;
Wine ; cigarettes ; a mask ; a fan ;
A Persian rug ; a deep divan ;
Repose and joy. Here lives Pierrot.
ii.
All day I keep my vigil here,
My day-dream, until dusk draws down,
And out of the great noise of town
Expected eager steps draw near.
And then the shadow I pursue
Grows substance ; beauty, voice and touch,
I have so longed for, loved so much,
Dawn on me, and the dream comes true.
hi..
Come in, come in, sweetheart of mine,
And let the crazy world go by
With blare and dust and pageantry !
For here are books, and love, arid wine.
The good God here has made a place
Where it is good for us to be,
And given it to you' and me—
Lift up that merry little face j
IV.
b J r > go by, you slaving throngs,
With heavy footsteps and sad eyes.
And never guess what paradise
To one improvident belongs !
For we have eaten of the fruit
Of knowledge, and know good from ill *
i And we have chosen love ; while still-
The joyless argue and dispute.
Tut, tut! What is this idle prate
Of “ duty ” and of “ circumstance,”
Of “if ” and “ but,” and means ” and “ chance ” ?
But love, and love will make you great.
v.
There is a corner of the room
Where all his mistress’ garments be,
Hung up in order daintily,
Breathing faint odours through the gloom.
Ah, friends, for you your gardens wide,
Where you may walk the world away
In a long, meditative day,
With phlox and rose on either side.
He chooses the seclusion dim
Of four walls and a door that locks,
Where fairer things than rose or phlox
Bloom, in the scented dusk for him.
vi.
When old romance and moonlight lie
On every city square and tree,
The moonflower, Pierrette, is she;
Her lover moon, Pierrot, am I.
Children of beauty and of night,
We lie awake and babble tales
Of love, until the moonshine fails
And slumber seals our-happy plight.
VII.
Here lives the innocent Pierrot;
Freedom and beauty all he asks.
For love will guide his joyous task 3,
And truth is all that he would know.
Bliss Carman, in
THE SMART AET.
Art—and Other Things.
REASONABLY enough, the most artistic
work in N.S.W. Society of Artists’ Spring
Exhibition is the work of Chinese. It is
a collection of embroidered stuffs, figures
in bronze and porcelain, wood carvings, and other
articles of vertu “acquired by purchase and other-
wise” by a member of N.S.W. war-contingent to
China. If Australia cannot emulate the magnifi-
cence of Chinese decorative art, she can at all
events steal the products of that art from the
makers and owners under the loot-license of war—
and plume herself and her art exhibitions with the
spoils.
Longstaff’s three portraits “ Marjorie,”
“Mignon,” and “J. C. Williamson”—lead the
picture-show, and. for quality of workmanship
leave the ruck far behind. (“Mignon,” though
the identity is undisclosed, may surely be classed
as a portrait.) Julian Ashton shows his quality in
“The Coral Necklet”—a half-length study of a
woman—well-painted—well-enough-painted to be
called a picture. He loses his quality in the shore-
scape called “The Wave” (priced 2500 guineas,
or some such remarkable figure—we price our
art, in this community, according to the canvas it
covers). The setting of the Wave is well-com-
posed, but the Wave is a mere mass of white
paint, solid and motionless. Howard Ashton
publishes some humorous attempts at composing
colours—al 1 feeble, feeble. Sid Long improves in
the more profitable field of portraiture—Mayor
Graham’s robes are well painted; and atop you
see a fairly-painted face—such a little bread to so
much sack—it is a portrait of “.The Robes of
Mayor Graham.” His other portraits follow
Lpngstaff at an amateur’s respectful distance—
Longstaff and milk-and-water. His landscapes
are good —more mast Vrly—quieter, and in some
respects better than hit 'more ambitious landscapes
of 1900 and 1899.
One of the best pictures in the exhibition &
Thea Proctor’s “Birds of a Feather” —the lady
peacocking it in a glorious purple robe which out-
vies her twin peacock’s purple eyes. Harry Gar-
lick’s “Way to the Dear Old River”—a troop of
horses and foals, takes you more and more the
more you look at it. It is fresh, simple,
q U i e t_a rounded piece of Nature. Fred. Leist’s
Swagman at the end of a day is a brave
attempt, well imagined and well coloured,
yet somewhat missing its effect of tragedy—
one could be content to take the last long tramp
through such a rosy sunset. There are just two
ways of getting its proper artistic effect out of the
Final Worm—by a harmony of ideas in which
everything crawls and lowers, grim and ghastly,
or by violently contrasting the Worm with the
Joy of Life. But Leist’s back-turned swagman is
too softly pathetic ; he merges naturally in the
soothing evenglow ; and the resultant impression
is a sentiment which 'does not rise to the height of
emotion.
Two newer flower-painters, Edith Loudon and
Norah Daley, seem to get more truth into and
more value out of flower-subjects than we have
been accustomed to. P. van der Yelden has a
single figure and a composition of figures which
are full of clever, painstaking work, yet fail to
attract or interest. D. G. Reid is seen to just as
much advantage in a small water-colour as in
larger oils ; but he has nothing in particular to
show us. Garlick’s and Leist’s work in black-
and-white is good and grows better ; and Souter,
another who improves with years and pains, has
at least one fair drawing. But one usually feels
the need of a brain behind his brain, of a better
imagination to give effect to his clever technique.
There are probably other things which should
be mentioned : the Society of Artists is stimu-
lating : it encourages the young buds to blossom,
though they usually blossom in old familiar ways.
Tiiis year the Exhibition shows signs of strain;
and a few of the daubs hung are the worst that
have been seen for several years.—This impression
may be supplemented next week. Meanwhile,
note that N.S.W. Legislature has issued its fiat—
and the rival societies are to rent the same rooms
(and exhibit together?) or—no more Govt, sub-
sidy ! Who will paint that grand historical pic-
ture—the meeting of Napoleon Ashton and Wel-
lington Lister on the flooring-boards of union ?
Or will the Society of Artists—can it ? —bravely
refuse subsidy, and rely on its own efforts?
Australian Verse To-Day.
A “PERSONAL VIEW.”
THIRTY years ago and more Adam Lindsay
Gordon published in Melbourne his last
(and his good) book of ballad-verse—
“ Bush Ballads and Galloping Rhymes”—
which the eager pen of Marcus Clarke exalted
into “ the beginnings of a national school of Aus-
tralian poetry.” And, partly because Gordon was
an ardent horse-lover, partly because his verse Was
alive and strongly tinged with local colour,
Australians accepted their favourite journalist’s
dictum; though, significantly enough, it was
always the racing rhythms of “How we
Beat the Favourite ” that roused bushmen
to enthusiasm rather than the scrub and
stockyards of “From the Wreck,” or the wattle-
blossom sentiment of “ The Sick Stockrider.”
These appealed to the new-ehuni, the tourist, the
townsman, who straightway (having read Clarke’s
preface) felt themselves transported into a fantas-
tic and almost legendary land, full of trees with-
out shade, and flowers without perfume, and
flights of cockatoos shrieking like evil souls. So
the cult grew, while with Gordon men associated
Kendall—Australian indeed, but introspective,
inactive, life’s victim :
“ The world is round me with its heat,
And toil, and cares that tire ;
I cannot with my feeble feet
Climb after my desire.”
Surely there was never a “national” poet so un-
typical of his countrymen ! And, as for Gordon,
his verse is Australian just as much and as little
as “ With Kitchener to Khartoum ” is Soudanese,
or “ The Silverado Squatters” American.
But while this cult absorbed the critics, Aus-
tralians were beginning to speak for themselves.
Timidly at first, with avowed imitation of the
leaders ordained for them, the young men who
did things found voice also. Of the track and the
camp-fire songs are born ; the primitive emotions
run to verse in all climates and among all races.
One sits down to write prose; its muse is really
sessilis rather than pedestris. The tramp of
your horse’s feet or your own beats your thought
into simple but live rhythm; you hum it
to yourself as you go, you chant it—
with some bashfulness—to your mates in the
evening ; presently you think so well of it that it
goes by mail (and that way, in Australia, is not
as prosaic as it sounds) to seek favour of an editor.
And for twenty years there has lived in Sydney,
New South Wales, one editor at least with ears on
the strain to catch the note of any genuine singer,
and a hand to welcome any man who could tell
his fellows without cant what things he saw and felt
day by day in going about his ordinary business.
With the politics of The Bulletin we have nothing
to do here ; its services to Australian literature
are great, and are these—that it has consistently
chastened the ambitious writer and exposed the
pretentious, but has never refused a hearing or
encouragement to anyone who had something to
say and was unaffectedly trying to say it.
Aboutsixyearsago A. B. Paterson, known already
to all the bush as “The Banjo,” put together a
book of the verse he had been writing at odd times
for The Bulletin , and its success stirred several of
his companions to follow his example; so that
by now a good many young poets expound in print,
each after his kind, the emotions and interests of
the men they know. Paterson, and after him Ogil-
vie, speak for the bushmen mounted, the drover,
the stockman, the travelling shearer ; Lawson
knows better the life of small townships and
selections and the unhoping, unending round of
the swagman out back. The mines claim Dyson ;
Brady weavps the sailors’ chanties into fuller verse;
Adams interprets New Zealand, more romanti-
cally than his fellows perhaps, and getting not so
near the heart of things. The earlier comers,
Paterson and Lawson, were welcomed in England
as they deserved; since then critics seem to
have tired of this simple verse, and new-comers
have been received with more or less sarcasm—
“ another Australian poet ? the place must be full
of them !”
There are, no doubt, reasons for this tired feel-
ing. The Australian writer is apt to lack judg-
ment and to undervalue finished style; the
Australian public calls (or is supposed by its
publishers to call) for bulk in books; and most
volumes published in Sydney or Melbourne suffer
in consequence from undue padding. Somehow,
when a man yields to the temptation of interpo-
lating his poorer work among his better, it is
always on the padding that the reviewer’s eye
lights. Nor can a poet complain of such poetical
justice; though he, too, has his excuse, for
bookbuyers in the colonies are few in number,
and the author must appeal to all of them, to some
by style and some by subject, and some by sheer
animal-spirits. It is not exactly anybody’s fault
that our versifiers have been of late judged mainly
on their demerits ; but so it has happened, m ore’s
the pity. And if any one should ask why, ir this
age of minor poets, it is worth while to reconsider
judgments and obtrude again the work of a few
far-off ballad-singers—well, it is so just for this
reason : that while most minor poets sing of their
personal affairs and emotions, this group from the
South Seas is typical and explanatory of its home,
of its countrymen, of a race that is differentiating
itself physically and intellectually from the stock
of the home islands. One need not raise the
question, always academic, whether their verse is
really ‘ ‘ literature ”in the technical sense. To the
Englishman the best of it will remain exotic ; to
the Australian even its crudities are dear, because
they have the twang of his scented bushlands.
Only literary London studies with zeal work of all
sorts done beyond the Channel, and for reason of
race and training the Channel severs intellects far
more sharply than all the oceans. One’s own
family may be, after all, as well worth under-
standing as the people across the road.
The Australian who writes because it is in him
to write is not much of a reader—in the literary
sense, that is ; he reads all sorts of journalism,
but sustained work of good quality does not come
his way. In expressing the emotions he shares
with the world he is apt to follow cheap and
shoddy phraseologists, the only models he has (so
that his love-verse, for instance, may be either
penny plain or twopence very highly coloured);
on his own ground however, he talks in altogether
different fashion. You open on
“ You have crossed my life with your fair sweet face ; ■,
You are filling my lone heart’s vacant place ; ”
and you shut the book again hastily. But—
“ They stood aside and they watched them pass in the
glow of the sinking sun,
With straining muscles and tightened chains—sixteen
pulling like one ;
With jingling harness and droning wheels and bare hoofs’
rhythmic tramp,
With creaking timbers and lurching load the Fire Queen
faced the swamp.”
“ She dipped her red shafts low in the slush as a spoonbill
dips her beak,
The black mud clung to the wheels and fell in the wash
of the Wilga creek, r
And the big roans fought for footing, and the spreaders
threshed like flails,
And the great wheels lifted the muddy spume to the bend
of the red float rails,”
(just a dray crossing the five-mile swamps of a
flooded creek); or
“ Where the mulga paddocks are wild and wide,
That’s where the pick of the stockmen ride
At the Back o’ Bourke !
Under the dust clouds dense and brown,
Moving southward by tank and town,
That’s where the Qneensland mobs come down
Out at the Back o’Bourke ! ”
or the burden of the shearing song
“ For the Western creeks are calling,
And the idle days are done,
With the snowy fleeces falling,
And the Queensland sheds begun ! '*
Simple enough, no doubt: but so Ogilvie stirs his
mates. As for Brady and his sailors —
“ They swung across Newcastle bar
And sou’ by east away ;
They saw the Cross hung out afar
Below the Milky Way :
They saw the land die down a-lee, and heard the rollers go
Across the road, along the road, the road to Callao 1”
It may not be literature, but it has the lilt:
“ A mermaid’s not a human thing,
An’ courtin’ sich is folly ;
Of flesh and blood I’d rather sing
What ain’t so melancholy.
Oh, Berta ! Loo ! Juanita ! Sue 1
Here’s good luck to me an’ you—
Sing rally ! ri-a-rallv ! '
The seas is deep : the seas is wide :
But this I’ll prove vvhate’er betide,
I’m bully in our alley
With such verse the men who are doing much
work stir themselves to do more. For the dreamer
and the tired man there is verse of other quality :
“ There was no water in the land.
Deep in the night of each ravine
Men vainly searching for it, found
Dry hollows in the gaping ground,
Like sockets where clear eyes had been,
Now burnt out with a fiery brand.”
The West—the far, unknown, central plains
that Leichhardt vanished into, and many a man
since—is never far from the dreams of our poets :
witness Quinn —
“ ‘ And how are these wayfarers called,
And whither do they' wend.? ’
The Weary r -Hearted —and their road
At sunset hath an end.
“ ‘ Shed tears for them.' . . . Nay, nay, no tears !
They yearn for endless rest;
Perhaps large stars will burn above
Their camp within the West.”
or Ogilvie again—
“ West of the World all true hearts ride
To a further bourne than the best have trod,
Till they cross the last creek gleaming wide
And wave their hands from the last divide
Ere they drop their load at the feet of God-
West of the World ! ”
I have said little of what I meant to say. It
might have been better, perhaps, to do nothing
but quote, for there is so much left out —the work
of Paterson and Lawson and Brunton Stephens,
because England knows a little of them already ;
most of Quinn’s and Daley’s, and all Brennan’s,
because they are mainly personal, and appeal to a
smaller audience in their own country ; a dozen
others, because they write scholarly and graceful
imitations, using Australia merely as an effective
back-ground for otherwise commonplace figure-
drawing. Yet room may be found, perhaps, for
one more singer ; for in expressing her own feeling
of Sydney, Louise Mack echoes and enhances the
dragging desire of the true Australian towards his
home: —
“ Dreaming, I tell you allmy tale—
Tell how the tides that wash your feet
Sink through my heart and cut its cords
Dreaming, I hold my arms and dray>-
All, all into my heart —the flag /
On the low hill turned harbounvyvds.
“ And all the curving little-bays,
The hot, dust-riddeyy harrow streets,
The languid turquoise of the sky,
The gardensflyuing to the wave,
I drag them ,K. 0 City, save
The grave fot me where I must lie ! ”
Arthur W. Jobs in Literature (published from
London Times office.)
COMMEMORATION.
I sat by the granite pillar and sunlight fell
Where the sunlight fell of old,
And the hour was the hour my heart remembered well,
And the sermon rolled and rolled
As it used to roll when the place was still unhaunted,
And the strangest tale in the world was still untold.
And I knew that of all this rushing of urgent sound
That. I so clearly heard,
The green young forest of saplings clustered round
Was heeding not one word :
Their heads were bowed in a still serried patience
Such as an angel’s breath couM never have stirred.
For some were already away to the hazardous pitch,
Or lining the parapet wall,
And some were in glorious battle, or great and rich,
Or throned in a college hall :
And among the rest was one like my own young phantom
Dreaming for ever beyond my utmost call.
“ Oh Youth,” the preacher was crying, “ deem not thou
Thy life is thine alone ;
Thou bearest the will of the ages, seeing how
They built thee bone by bone,
And within thy blood the Great Age sleeps sepulchred
Till thou and thine shall roll away the stone.
“ Therefore the days are coming when thou shalt burn
With passion whitely hot ;
Rest shall be rest no more ; thy feet shall spurn
All that thy hand hath got ;
And One that is stronger shall gird thee, and lead thee
swiftly
Whither, O heart of Youth, thou wouldest not.”
And the School passed ; and I saw the living and dead
Set in their seats again,
And I longed to hear them speak of the word that was
said,
But I knew that I longed in vain.
And they stretched forth their hands, and the wind of
the spirit took them
Lightly as drifted leaves on an endless plain.

The News from England.
“It is about ten years ago,” says Mrs. Gray,
“that I became acquainted with Seigel’s Syrup —
a time when I greatly needed something having
healing virtue in it.
“A cousin of mine in the old country (near
London) had for years been a perfect martyr to
indigestion. His trouble was principally a violent
colic, from torpid stomach and liver.
“After years of almost hopeless suffering he
finally discovered in Seigel’s Syrup a perfect
remedy. I presume he first came to know of it
through reading some kind of advertisements. It
does not matter.
“ As I always keep up a regular correspondence
with my relatives they were aware of the dreadful
condition I was in with indigestion.
“Naturally they lost no time in letting me
know of my cousin’s marvellous recovery—after
he had vainly expended a deal of money in feeing
doctors and so forth.
“They said Mother Seigel’s Syrup alone had
restored his health, and strongly urged me to try
it.
“ I suffered from violent pains across my
stomach and under the shoulder-blades, a bitter
and disgusting taste in my mouth, want of sleep,
languor and weariness, and all the evils and ail-
ments, bodily and mental, which seem part and
parcel of that common and abominable malady.
“Finally, under the strong importunity of a
friend, I was induced to try a dose of Siegel’s
Syrup. I wish to state emphatically that even so
small a quantity gave me immediate relief, and
after I had used it for a time regularly, and
according to the directions, I was gradually and
surely restored to my usual good health. I now
believe in this famous remedy for the best of
reasons—my experience of its merits. I never
cease praising it to my friends, and always keep
it in the house against the time when it may be
needed.
“I feel grateful for what Seigel’s Syrup has
done for me; and if you desire to publish my
statement for the good of others, you have my
free permission so to do.” Jane M. M. Gray,
Ave Maria Cottage, Auburn, Sydney, N.S.W.,
October 4th, 1899.

TESTIMONIALS.
“ To the Daylesford Mineral Water 00.
“ Dear Sirs.—The Machine purchased from you is per-
fect. The stuff turned out is splendid. It is the best
speculation I have entered into since I joined the Licensed
Victuallers.—Geo. Nicholls, Royal Hotel, Swan Hill.”
Mr. Klug, Hotelkeeper, Charlton, says “It is worth
its WEIGHT IN GOLD.”
Mr. P. Kennedy, Coolgardie, says :—“ Profits saved by
making my own supplies of Aerated Waters with the
Machine pay the rent of my hotel.”
Mr. Lewis, Heidelberg, Victoria, says “ I have made
thousands of dozens of the best Aerated Waters with the
Machine, and it has not required sixpence worth of repairs.
No Hotelkeeper should be without one of them.”
Mr. W. Atkinson, Hotelkeeper, Wentworth, N.S.W.,
says:—“lt is the greatest money-maker yet discovered
for hotelkeepers.”
Mr. Burk, Yalgo, W.A., says Since getting one of
your Machines, and making my own soft stuff, I have
saved its price ten times over.”
W. H. Jones, Peak Hill, W.A., says “Machine great
SU E?Dav!S, Peak Hill, W.A., says “ Cannot speak too
highly of effectiveness and simplicity.”
G. N. Murdoch, Abbotts, W.A., says “ Value of
Machine indisputable ; quality and cheapness of stuff
unquestionable.”
T. H. Williams, Mossman, Queensland, says “ Highly
successful, and recommend to all hotelkeepers.”
J. S. Davidson, Bundaberg, Queensland, says Great
saving compared to previous cost of stock."
A profitable business awaits pushing men in many small
centres of population, where a deeply-felt want exists for
a good quality of Aerated Waters. Observe the profits.

Falling the Stars.
There is a gang that labours
Due east from Heaven’s wall,
To roll of sounding tabours
And golden trumpet-call.
They work eight hours, and frolic
Each other twelve away ;
The off-shifts prank and rollick
While on-shifts graft their day.
They have no galling bosses,
Equipped with curse and frown ;
’Mid green and golden Josses
They hew the tall stars down.
They labour in the dingles
Where stars bud forth and grow;
In sixes and in singles
I hear the axes go.
The star-trunks go up bravely
Like eastern cedar trees ;
Their frondage murmurs gravely
Upon the morning breeze.
But ringing ! ringing ! ringing !
I hear the axes go ;
When dark, soft nights come winging
The stars are lying low.
The ferns creep up and cover
Where bright stars used to glow—
When sad, long days drift over
The stars are lying low :
When pain comes to the lover,
The stars are lying low.

Berinda’s Wooing.
No man upon the Western side
Has acres half so rich and wide ;
No man upon the sunset plain
Has such a gentle, winning smile,
So true a heart, so brave a style—
And yet Berinda woos in vain.
A dozen maids of high degree,
Of beauty and integrity,
Would give their jewelled hands to own
The right, for all their lives, to ride
The great plains at Berinda’s side—■
And yet Berinda rides alone.
Alone ! Except in stolen hours.
When Whitefoot tramps the August flowers,
Hard-held beside a fourteen-two
Bay pony of a mountain breed,
A wild-eyed, wanton, flirty steed
That bears—sweet burden ! —Eyes of Blue.
And Eyes of Blue ! Oh ! passing fair !
With gloveless hands and unbound hair
That ripples back in golden waves !
She’d rather whisper, low and sweet,
Soft praises to the bay mare’s feet
Than say the word Berinda craves !
And so Berinda woos in vain,
For all his wealth of hill and plain ;
For all his worth he lacks the art—
Although his kindly eyes of brown
Won half the dames in Sydney town—
To win one wayward bush-girl’s heart!

Fate!
I know that my hands are tied by Fate,
My destined place must fill,
If I would fight I must fight with God,
Must battle against His will.
I know that I must go with the tide
That drags away to sea,
Must drift along till the surf-beaten shore
Brings peace from tears to me.
Floating along on the waves of the world,
Drifting along out to sea ;
Derelict! Derelict! drifting along !
At liberty, yet never free.
How can I fight when I fight with God ?
Away from Him can I flee ?
Derelict! Derelict ! drifting along !
The things that are must be.
I know that the God has portioned me
A birthright but of ill;
If I would strive I must strive with Him
My destined place to fill,
Till I strike on the rocks and the breakers
That guard Eternity’s shore,
Am cast by the waves of the Ocean of Life
On the Peace beyond Death’s door.
Floating along on the waves of the world,
Drifting along out to sea ;
Derelict! Derelict! drifting away
At liberty, yet never free.
How can I fight when I fight with God ?
Where from Him can I flee ?
Derelict! Derelict! drifting away.
The things that are must be.

Interesting indeed would be a history of
the influence of woman on contemporary politics.
It should deal with the small and the great —the
little marsh-lights which guide the Pedlington
politician to the fatal K.C.M.G-., and volcanic
outbursts such as that told of Crispi. Crispi was
invited to a royal dinner-party, but his wife, who
was “not quite the thing,” was neglected. The
Prime Minister went personally to the Quinnal
and spoke to the King’s secretary: “Tell your
master that if Madame Crispi does not receive
due reparation before this evening, within 48
hours the Republic will be proclaimed in Italy.
That night the lady dined at the Royal table.
“J.D.” puts in a word for his beloved
Flyspeck:
Tasmanians at last begin to realise what a splendid
asset they have in their climate. Hitherto, sunburnt
souls of tiie mainland, looking for a spot to cool-down in,
have been allowed to drift casually towards the South
Pole via Maoriland, regardless of the fact that Tasmania
is a lot nearer home and just as near Heaven as the more
widely advertised Kingdom of Seddon. But Tasmania is
not to remain the Island of Dreams for ever. In
corroboration whereof let it be noted that during the last
five weeks—Aug. 21 to Sept. 28—the Southern Tas.
Tourists’ Association increased its membership from 90 to
215. Extensive advertising of the beauty-spots of the
island is to happen immediately, and a Sydney agency' has
been commissioned to disseminate the requisite informa-
tion. The publication in Sy'dney of a little holiday paper
to advocate the claims of Appleland is also contemplated.
HAVE YOU
A BAD LEG
with Wounds that Discharge or otherwise, perhaps sur-
rounded with inflammation and swollen that when you
press your finger on the inflamed part it leaves the impres-
sion ? If so, under the skin you have poison that defies all
the remedies you have tried, which, if not extracted, yon
never can recover, but go on suffering till death releases
you. Perhaps your knees are swollen, the joints being
ulcerated; the same with the ankles, round which the skin
may be discoloured, or there may be wounds ; the disease
if allowed to continue will deprive you of the power to
walk. You may have attended various hospitals and had
medical advice, and been told your case is hopeless, or
advised to submit to amputation ; but do not, for I CAN
CUKE YOU. I don’t say perhaps ; but I WIDE. Because
others have failed is no reason for not now being cured.

SATURDAY, NOVEMBER 9, 1901.
Janus, the Importer.
All through the dreary monotony of three
weeks the Federal tariff debate dragged
its broken back and its crushed tail along
the ground on the indefinite road to no-
where in particular. It was understood
all along that nobody expected the debate to
convert anybody ; that the result of it was a
foregone conclusion ; and that when it ar-
rived at its inevitable end, after weeks
spent in repeating over again all the things
that everybody had said before, the matter
debated would be no nearer a settlement.
The same gang of venal obstructionists and
billet-hunters state proudly that they are
going to say the same things all over again
on the separate clauses of the Tariff Bill
on each separate clause, if possible—in com-
mittee. There was nothing to gain by post-
poning the division—nothing but self-adver-
tisement and aggravation. It was merely
a resumption of George Reid’s old un-
scrupulous tactics of obstruction. That
same weary babbler once blocked business
in N.S.W. Assembly for three years with 13
votes of censure, and apparently he proposes
to be the same senseless log across the path
of Federal legislation. And the supreme
absurdity of it all is that the Reid party
wastes all this time in fighting for a policy
which, it says, is ruinous, disastrous, un-
christian, contrary to all sound economic
theories, and calculated to undermine the
foundations of the State, and raise Cain
generally.
* * * »
For the Reid party, be it noted, proposes
to raise as much customs taxation as the
Barton party is fighting for. Its special
organ, the Sydney Telegraph, in its issue
of September 6th, published the Foreign-
trade crowd’s proposed tariff, and afterwards,
when the Federal tariff appeared, repub-
lished.it and set the two side by side in its
financial columns in this fashion :
Daily Telegraph Kixgston-Turner
Sept. 6. tariff, Oct. 9.
Customs .. £7,414,000 .. £7 388 056
Exclse •• 1.558,000 .. 1,*554,’345
£8,972,000 .. £8,942,401
Therefore, to be strictly accurate, the Free-
trade party demands a shade more tariff
taxation than does the Barton Govern-
ment s High Tariff party. It proposes to
make its duties rather lower, and to compen-
sate by taxing more articles, but it proposes
to get there just the same. Under its pro-
posed tariff, 88 per cent, of the imports that
come into Australia are to be taxed, and it
boosts up the advantages of this theory by
pointing to the alleged prosperity of Britain
under a system whereby only 7 per cent,
of the imports are taxed. The Reid party
proposes to raise 83 per cent, of its
taxation by duties on imports, and it
professes to demonstrate the advisability of
this by declaring that Britain is a glorious
evidence of prosperity, and a bright and
shining light unto the nations, under a sys-
tem whereby only 22 per cent, of the
revenue is raised by duties on imports.
It declares that it is the Freetrade party
because it wants to make trade free—and it
proposes to tax practically nine-tenths of
Australia s imports ; also it screams, at the
same time, about removing the trammels
from commerce, and knocking the shackles
off trade. The Reid gang has posed for
years as the one that is in favor of direct
as against indirect taxation. It refers
proudly to the progress of the United King-
dom under a system which collects less
than a quarter of the national tax revenue
by customs duties, about a quarter
by excise, the other half and all the
Local Government revenue by direct taxa-
tion.. And by way of proving, either
that it doesn’t believe in the progress of the
United Kingdom, or that it doesn’t want
Australia to progress, it proposes, if it gets
into Federal office, to raise the whole of its
tax revenue by customs and excise, and have
no direct taxation whatever.
* * * *
It is admitted by both parties that nearly
£9,000,000 of taxes must be collected by the
Federal Government in order to keep the
States solvent—in fact, not one of the six
State Treasurers sees his way to be quite
solvent even with that amount. The Barton
party proposes to find the required sum by
customs and excise, because it says that that
is a good way to raise money. The Reid
party proposes to raise the same sum in the
same way because it says it is an unutterably
bad way to raise money. The Barton party
holds that the foreigner who sends the goods
here pays a large part of the tax, and there-
fore customs are the cheapest way of raising
money, so far as the consumer is concerned ;
and in that belief it is an honorable
and patriotic thing on the part of
the Barton Government to propose
raising the requisite funds this way.
The Reid party says that the Australian
consumer pays all the import duties;
that he pays them twice or three times over
because the price of goods increases out of
all proportion to the cash received by the
Treasury ; and that customs taxation is a
most wasteful and disastrous method of find-
ing revenue. Therefore, for the Reid
party to propose raising the same amount
this way is, by its own showing, the act of a
gang of rascals and a gathering of public
enemies. The Barton Government repre-
sents the party which believes that customs
taxation (as apart from excise), in addition
to supplying the necessary £7,000,000 odd
yearly, and not permanently raising prices,
but rather reducing them in the end, can be
made to do most valuable service to the
country by establishing sound and profitable
industries—by supplying employment and
good wages—by creating wealth which
will yield extra revenues in its turn
by increasing the returns from in-
come tax, land tax, stamp duties, pro-
bate duties, and other existing imposts.
Therefore, it follows its conscience in pro-
posing customs taxation. The Reid Oppo-
sition declares that customs taxation, in
addition to raising £7,000,000 odd, not only
increases prices to such a fearful and ruinous
extent that the people will pay about
£20,000,000, but also that it doesn’t establish
any sound industries, or supply the people
with any extra employment, or any extra
wages, or create national wealth in any way. So
in propounding its £7,000,000 odd of customs
duties, it appears, on its own sworn affidavit,
to consist of a number of men who have been
hired by parties that are still at large to
damage this country all they can ; and on
that ground their execution seems urgently
called for.
* * * *
The Reid party declares, on its solemn and
unreliable oath, that customs taxation per-
manently increases the price of goods to the
extent of about three times the duty, with-
out any compensating advantage to the con-
sumer —in other words, that to raise
£7,000,000 from this source the people have
to pay, perhaps, £21,000,000, and the other
£14,000,000 is practically lost. It says that
direct taxation has no such drawback. It
tells the public that, to get the proposed £2
per head from the nation by customs, it is
necessary for the nation to pay about £6 per
head, with no indirect benefit to make good
the loss ; while, to get £2 per head revenue
by direct taxation, it is only necessary for
the people to pay £2. Yet it flatly refuses,
if it gets office, to save them the other £4,
and thus lift an unbearable burden off
the community’s shoulders, and make it
rich, and earn such boundless gratitude
that its portfolio will be safe for
life and it will be canonised after death
as the saviour of the country, and
have its bones squashed by a golden
monument. There are plenty of direct-tax
methods by which £2 per inhabitant could
be raised—house-tax, poll-tax, and income-
tax without exemptions are three that
may be mentioned. Britain raises more
than that. Even the poorest individual
would hardly object to paying £2 in new
direct taxation if he thereby saved £6 in
other ways, and if he did object his voice
would be lost in the general shout of ap-
proval. Or if the Reid party can’t quite live
up to its principles, let it at least follow the
British precedent it so much talks about,
and confine its customs taxation to spirits
and narcotics, and about five other articles,
with equal excise duties on the local pro-
ducts, and thereby definitely swear off the
curse of Protection.
* * * •
All through thetariffdebate, andall through
many other debates, the howl and groan of
the Foreign-trade party has been that Britain
has become great and rich and prosperous
by reason of its fiscal policy, that Australia
should follow that bright example, and that
the Reid party is the crowd to show it how to
do so. And this, supposing the Reid party’s
“ revenue tariff, ’’ as expounded by Sydney
Telegraph, to be adopted, and other things
to remain as at present, is how the Common-
wealth would follow Britain’s example :
Amount op Taxation per Inhabitant Annually.

Which may be summarised thus :

Customs, per head .. £0 11 6 £1 19 3
Excise, per head .. 016 4 0 8 3
Direct taxes .. .. 219 5 111 7
And The Bulletin again asks : What is the
good of the Reid crowd being the anti-tariff
party with an enormous tariff?—the Free-
trade party which proposes to levy duties on
88 per cent, of the country’s imports ?—the
direct taxation party which won’t levy direct
taxation ?—the party which says in columns
and columns of weary printed slush that
Britain’s policy is the policy which makes
nations great, yet won’t adopt it, though that
policy would supply all the money required,
and more ?—the party which declares we
should imitate Britain and always proposes
to do the other thing ?
* * • •
The Freetrade party in Australia has
always been this kind of a party. In its
time of office in N.S. W. it babbled, just as it
babbles now, about direct taxation and about
following the fiscal system which, it said,
had made England great. And even then it
levied twice as much customs revenue as it
did direct taxation, whereas Britain levies
twice as much direct taxation as customs
duties. No party has talked more about
Britain’s noble example, or avoided follow-
ing it more carefully. And now that same
gang of Foreign-trade impostors recommends
its tremendous tariff to the Australian people
with the assurance, which is put forward as
its chief merit, that it won’t create any
new industries, or find anybody employment,
or do anything except keep up imports—
to do which it must keep down local
industry—and maintain, the profits of
the importers, and take £2 or £3 from the
people for every £1 received by the Treasury.
At least, that is how the party declares that
import duties work. It appeals to the
country as the political faction which knows
what is right and isn’t going to do it—which
only sees one example in the world worth
following (that of Britain), and isn’t going to
follow it—as the party of Janus and of
Mr. Facing-Both-Ways. It is, on its
own evidence, the boss hypocrite of
Australasia. It is the combination which,
whenever it sees a new source of em-
ployment growing up, writes furiously in its
protected Daily Telegraph about the
“ ricketty industries ” of its own country,
because its importing friends live on the
absence of Australian industries and the
necessity for foreign supplies. It is
the party which carefully reserves the
right, if its tariff does, by acci-
dent, create a new Australian industry, to
alter the tariff so as to destroy it, as it tried
to do with the N.S.W. sugar industry, and
as it would have done if its courage hadn’t
failed it. In fact, its policy appears, by its
own evidence, to be based on these three
maxims :
(1) Raise all possible revenue by customs duties ; the
importer will pass them on to the public with 50 or 100
per cent, added so that he will make more money instead
of less.
(2) But carefully adjust these customs duties so that
they won’t lead to the establishment of any new in-
dustries, for local supplies would reduce impprts and
diminish the importers’ profits, and local competition
would reduce prices and diminish the importers’ profits.
(3) And don’t levy any direct taxation that can possibly
be avoided, for direct taxation falls heavily on the richer
classes, and the rich importer would have to pay.
Inebriety and Ineptitude.
After a century of treating the irresponsible
drink-maniac as a criminal, instead of as a victim
partly of its own Great Rum Tradition, partly of
the general weakness of human nature, N.S. W., in
1900, passed an Inebriates Act. The intention
was to substitute medical for penal treatment in
that particular form of disease which takes the
shape of anunreasonablethirst —to give that chance
of salvation to the drink-victim which a fine of £1
or seven days certainly did not offer. Having
passed the Inebriates Act (deliberating, by the
way, in the building once known as the Rum
Hospital, because built out of the proceeds of
State-traffic in that liquor), N.S.W. Parliament
left it to the N.S.W. Government to administer.
Progress towards practical work was, as is always
the case in Australian politics, slow. By 18th
January, 1901, the Government had got as far as
issuing a set of “ regulations ” in regard
to the Act. These regulations (in 24 closely-
printed pages of foolscap), covered every possible
point which could be suggested for the proper
control of inebriate institutions, from the con-
stitution of the ladies’ visiting committee to the
legalisation of dominoes as a means of amusement
for patients. They set forth 28 rules for the
guidance of the medical officer of such an institu-
tion, 25 for the superintendent, 35 for the assistant
superintendent, 25 for the senior attendant, 14 for
the night attendant, 12 for the junior attendant
(including a statesmanlike clause with regard to
kitchen fat), 31 for the matron ; and so on down
to 8 for the carpenter. The only points omitted
were (1) to make any provision for the establish-
ment of any inebriate institute where these
beautiful rules might apply. (2) To suggest any
means by which the inebriate might be caught and
subjected to the 460 rules set forth.
• * * *
But they were beautiful rules, and N.S.W.
Government admired them from January 18,1901,
to‘24th July, 1901, and then had them printed.
The next step was for the Judges of the Supreme
Court to draw up some more rules; and (dis-
guising them under the Latin title of Reyulae
Generates) it issued 19 of them and ■ some appen-
dices, and schedules on July 31, 1901. These rules
were designed to provide means for catching the
inebriate. Then, in October, 1901, the matter was
advanced another stage by the appointment of a
committee to visit the Inebriate Homes which
don’t exist. Having thus (1) set forth minute
instructions for the management of an Ine-
briate Asylum, (2) adopted rules for getting an
inebriate there, and (3) appointed a visiting com-
mittee, it is reasonable to suppose that N.S.W.
Government will, within the next few years,
build, buy, or rent a building, and definitely set
out on its medical treatment of the drink lunatic.
• * « *
But, as a matter of cold fact, it need not hurry
in the least over the matter. For build though it
may a splendid retreat for the dipsomaniac it will
never catch its inebriate. The Reyulae Generates
of the Supreme Court see to that. The matter
being almost purely a medical one, a question de-
manding the skilled attention of the pathologist
and the psychologist, the N.S.W. system de-
manded that it should be referred to Fredk.
M. Barley, C.J., M. H. Stephen, J., Wm.
Owen, J., G. B. Simpson, J., H. E. Cohen, J.,
Arch. H. Simpson, C.J. in Equity, and W.
Gregory Walker, J., for decision. These
gentlemen, apparently, read the Habeas Corpus
Act, the Declaration of Rights, Magna Charta,
Coke and Lyttleton, and Stephen’s Commen-
taries, and then framed rules for the apprehension
of the inebriate which reflect all the best tradi-
tions of English freedom, are inspired by the
noblest regard for human liberty—and preserve
the drunkard’s liberty so carefully that they are
cpiite unsuited to a system whose whole purpose
is to deprive him of it.
*»* * *
If the learned Judges of the Supreme Court had
taken counsel of a few medical men—if they had
inquired the opinion of an inebriate in one of his
moments of repentance, there would have been
probably in their rules less horse-hair and more
horse ; sense. As it is, the shutting up of an
inebriate is made almost impossible. Thomas
Atkins, for example, merchant, has taken to
whisky so fervently that he never goes sober to
bed ; frequently he is on a spree for a week—
“dead to the world”—the while wife and
children suffer from neglect, and brutality. The
business is going to the dogs, and Thomas to
the devil as fast as can be. To save Thomas
(under the Reyulae Generates) some friend or
member of his family must petition the Chief
Judge in Equity, prove satisfactorily that
Thomas is incapable of managiny his affairs, and
provide medical corroboration of the fact. This
is only the preliminary, not the final, step. Copies
of these papers must be served on the alleged
inebriate and seven days or more after, a Judge
or magistrate may hear the application to send the
drink-victim to an asylum. The application is
heard like a suit at law. The alleged inebriate
can give evidence, call and cross-examine wit-
nesses. His summons to the court is worded :
Take notice that an application will be made to His
Honor the Judge sitting in Lunacy by counsel for the
within-named petitioner, on the day of , at
of the clock in the forenoon, or so soon thereafter as
counsel can be heard, for an order as prayed by the
within petition to be made, on the ground that you are
incapable of managing.your affairs, pursuant to section 5
of the Inebriates Act, 1900.
And that if you intend to object to such order being
made, notice of such objection must be signed by you and
attested by a Justice of the Peace or solicitor, and filed
with the Master in Lunacy wit Kini n seven days after your
receipt of this notice.
* * * *
Supposing Thomas Atkins has no desire to be
dragged from his public-house—and that is how
Thomas usually feels—he is a very futile sort of
person if, with seven days’ notice, he cannot sober
up sufficiently to convince the Court that he is
quite sane and sensible and fit to manage his
affairs. And so he is, for the time being. The
application scornfully refused, Thomas Atkins
goes back to his drink. Contrast this method with
that adopted in dealing with lunatics. The
solemn statement of one relation, with the
independent certificates of two doctors, and
without any court procedure, is sufficient
to commit a man or woman to an
asylum for the insane. To send a victim
to an Inebriate Home should be at least as
easy. There need be no fear of abuse if the
institutions are all kept under vigorous State
control. But the Supreme Court Judges framed
their rules with the bogey of the liberty of the
subject before their eyes, and fear in their hearts
that some X.L.N.T., M.P. or other alphabetical
conglomeration of a Rechabite Lodge might be
immured as an inebriate by a conspiracy of circum-
stances. They forget that an inebriate is not
exactly the same as a lunatic. A. lunatic can’t
become sane at seven days notice and deceive the
Court, but an inebriate can become sober in that
time. The law should be so swift on its feet that
if it receives notice when Thomas Atkins com-
mences his jamboree, it can have a reasonable hope
of personally inspecting him before the said
jamboree is over. And it should inspect him
without notice. To the drunkard who doesn’t
want to be locked in, it is proposed to give
lengthy warning that he may sober-up, disguise
himself in Ins right mind and his own, or some-
body else’s good clothes, and get evidence together
to prove his complete sobriety, or else go away
and continue his drunk elsewhere. What i«


wanted is a law which will bring Atkins before it
for immediate inspection, or, better still, send
reliable functionaries to instantly inspect Atkins.
Tlius the law would find out for certain what
state he is in, whereas a week later, 20 witnesses,
and days of legal proceedings, and £2OO m costs,
and a whole stock of perjury may leave the matter
still in doubt. The liberty of the subject is veiy
good in its way, but the business of this Act is to
interfere witli the liberty of the inebriated subjec .
—not to preserve it.
PLAIN ENGLISH.
Smash!
George Reid’s motion of censure on the Federal
Government’s fiscal policy went down horribly in
a minority of 14. During the last days of the
importers’ stonewall their luckless false prophet,
the Sydney Telegraph, bellowed confidently on
two matters —that N.S.W. was rising unanimously
against the Barton Government, and that the
Ministerial majority was fading daily and blowing
away like last year’s leaves. The pitiably unlucky
prophet had got the Government majority down to
10, and every now and then it was taking off one
or two more votes in the exuberance of its own
intellect—when the division came. Then things
happened. Not only did the Barton Ministry
prove as strong as ever, but the alleged “uprising
of N.S. VV. to fight against local industry, and m de-
fenceof theforeign importers, was a very, very poor
uprising after all. Out of 23 N.S. W. members who
voted, 10 went with Barton and 13 with Reid, so
in the alleged stronghold of the importers’ party,
the majority against local industry was only a bare
three after all. If pairs were included, then
N.S.W. gave 15 votes for Reid and 11 for Barton.
In New South Wales outside Sydney —in the agri-
cultural and pastoral and mining districts where
the “natural industries” are—there was a solid
majority for the Barton Government, and Sydney
only turned the scale slightly in the importers
interests. And despite all the unspeakably weary
bunkum about the Barton Ministry being a
Ministry which represented Victorian interestsand
1 ved by Victorian support, the Government would
have mustered a small majority even if all the
Victorian private members, friends and enemies
alike, had quitted the House in a body. There
isn’t even the consolation of saying that the nn-
p irters’ cause was lost because of the absence of
N.S.W. members. Out of N.S.W.’s 26 represen-
tatives, 23 voted and three paired. Not a single
vote was lost ; the Foreign-trade interest was
there to the last man. It was a great trial
of strength, and a great downfall. Sydney
Telegraph, as the principal and most disas-
trous Balaam of the importers’ party, alleges that
three of the Government’s supporters only voted
for it because of its Kanaka policy, and not on
account of its tariff, but as there is always some-
body who voted for something because of some-
thing else, there is little satisfaction and not
much explanation in this theory. Even the
worst-licked pugilist can always explain, while he
sits on the floor with his nose bleeding, that he
would have won if the other fellow hadn’t hit him.

Thomas’s Amendment.
A MAN who had practically no friends was
Tn >mas, N.S.W. member of the House of Repre-
sentatives, when he proposed his amendment on
G. Reid’s motion of censure. Reid’s motion, on
which the House had been pounding dismally,
contained in itself no statement of any fiscal prin-
ciples whatever. It was a general allegation to
the effect that the Barton Government’s proposals
were unsound,” but it didn’t state what sound
proposals should be put in their place, Thomas
proposed to add that the House was of opinion
that a Federal land-tax should be imposed, as a
means of enabling the Government to do with less
customs revenue ; and the result was that, outside
the Labor press, he had hardly a newspaper sup-
porter. Even the most Freetrade of the Freetrade
papers spoke severely about the only man who
tried to give their alleged policy a practical leg-
up. Considering that the Foreign-trade party
has spent the best part of a month talking about
the riches, happiness, and progress of England
under its fiscal system, and the necessity of follow-
ing the same if we want to be similar, it is indeed
strange that such a blightingly cold reception
should await the man who suggested even begin-
ning to follow England’s example ! In the United
Kingdom direct taxation (national and local)
amounts now to about £2 19s. sd. annually for
every inhabitant, and indirect taxation (customs
and excise) to £1 7s. lOd. In Australia, if the
Barton tariff or the Reid tariff comes in force
the two men propose to raise almost exactly the
same amount by customs, only Barton proposes to
raise it so that it will aid local industry, and Reid
so that it won’t—the direct taxation (Federal,
State and local) will be £1 11s. 7d. annually for
each inhabitant, and the indirect taxation
(customs and excise) £2 7s. 6d. Australia levies
less taxes on the whole than Britain si triply because
it is paying a large proportion of its ordinary
expenditure out of borrowed money and preparing
an inevitable national insolvency for later on—but
that is another question. In Britain direct taxation
on land and house property covers the bulk of the
cost of police, education, and charities (poor-rates),
to say nothing of road and bridge expenditure and
many other things. The only way Australia can
follow Britain’s fiscal principles (said by the Reid
and M’Millan and Bruce Smith and Pumpkin
diTTO party to be the only true source of
prosperity) is by putting more direct taxation
on land and other property. If direct taxation
here was put up to the British level, this
country could abolish all taxes on imported
goods, except a duty on imported liquors
and tobacco. It would only require to
raise, by customs and excise combined, £1 per
inhabitant. It could cut down its customs duties
to the present English basis, and its excise below
the present English basis, and yet give the Federal
and State Governments every penny that they
will have if the Barton tariff passes ! And yet,
after all the spread-eagleism of the importers’
party about the advantages of following the free
and enlightened fiscal system of Britain, the only
man who proposes that this country should begin
to do so by shifting part of the tax off
customs and on to the land (as they do in Eng-
land), is told on every hand that his proposal is
“ inoppoi’tune. ” More than that, he is often called,
by the Freetrade papers, a Socialist, a demagogue,
a revolutionary, a Domain orator or Yarra-
banker, a person with ideas that are beyond the
sphere of practical politics, a visionary, a
coufiscator, an undesirable person, and a danger
to society. Also, there is an opinion that he
should be dispersed by the police. The first
stepi towards following Britain’s fiscal example
are to abolish free newspaper postage, to double
the income-tax, to put up land-taxation local
-and -national—to about four times its present
amount ; to largely increase the duties on house
property ; then to abolish the sugar-duty, and
practically all other imposts save those on alcohol
and narcotics. If the Freetrade party won t do
that, it had better leave off holding forth about
the blessedness of Britain’s fiscal example.

The Alleged Uprising of N.S.W.
Following on Reid’s anti-Federal-tariff meeting
at Sydnev Town Hall comes Carruthers’ anti-
tariff meeting at the high-toned Sydney suburb of
Ashfield. This patient, pathetic flogging of the
late lamented horse is described as a great
uprising l of New South Wales against the tariff,
and a sign of what that State will do when it gets
its teeth into the Barton Ministry at next
election. Which is shriekingly funny. Sydney
and suburbs (the strongholds of the English and
German importers) aren’t rising against the
Barton tariff; they rose long ago. In fact
they seem to have been born standing up
so far as this question is concerned. They won t
do anything dreadful to Barton and co. at next
election ; they have already done all they can do.
They returned a solid crowd of importers’ nominees
at last election, and these voted solidly against the
tariff, and were licked. The rest of N.S.W.
saved the Barton Ministry. It got eleven
votes from the N.S.W. country districts, and if
only eight of the electorates which voted for
Barton could be converted to the Freetrade way
of thinking, there would be no Barton majority
left. Supposing N.S.W. had gone solidly in the
importers’ interests, Reid, instead of being de-
feated by 14 votes, would have won by eight.
Therefore, the Calico Jimmy party should go out
into the wilderness and convert to the importers’
views those 11 N.S.W. electorates which at
present support the cause of Australia, instead of
pounding away at the easy job of converting the
place that has been with it all along, and
getting the city that has been up all the time to
rise. It is no earthly use for an ardent Roman
Catholic to stay in Rome and preach to the Pope
in the hope of converting him to Roman Catho-
licism, or to try and pass him off as a new convert,
and as evidence of a great reaction towards
R.C’ism. Yet that is what Reid, Carruthers
and co. are doing.

A Lost Chance.
The Federal Senate undoubtedly lost its head
and its opportunity when the motion of censure
was brought forward recently in the House of
Representatives. The Senate is supposed to be,
in almost all essentials, a body whose importance
is equal to that of the other place. It is paid,
like it, and elected on an equally liberal franchise.
It represents the people, just as do the Represen-
tatives. The difficulty is, that the Federal Con-
stitution doesn’t say whether it has the same
power of ejecting Ministries. That is a point
which the Constitution couldn’t settle; things
have to shake down by experience and the
rolling on of time. State Upper Houses, being
non-representative bodies, admit that they have
no power and no right to make or unmake
Ministries, so when business is hung up by .
a motion of censure in a State Assembly,
the Council also suspends business. The Assem-
bly wheel stops, and the Council fly stops
also. And the Federal Senate did likewise,
thereby mistaking itself for a cheap and nasty
nominee Legislative Council. The House of
Representatives had to leave off ordinary business,
for its time was wholly occupied by the censure
debate, but the Senate’s three weeks adjournment
was absolute waste of time. It was a mistake on
the part of the Senate and an equal mistake oil
the part of the Minister who proposed it. The
Senate’s attitude should have been: “We are
sent here by the people and paid by the people to
do the people’s business. We represent the
people as much as the other House. If the other
House chooses to babble for one or two or three
weeks before it gives its vote (which could be
done in one day) whether it approves of the
Ministry or not, it isn’t our affair ; we are going
right on with business. Whichever way the
debate ends, the business has to be done,
and this is as good a time to do it as any
other time. When we move a vote of censure
we don’t expect the other House to leave
off work to listen to us ; we won’t leave off work
to listen to it. If we were only the tail, like a
State Leg. Council, we might adjourn when the
dog was engaged, but by virtue of our election on
a manhood suffrage basis we are as much the dog
as the Lower House is.” The Senate had it first
chance to assert itself as a popular Chamber, and
it also had a chance to express its valuable con-
tempt for the habit of gibbering for a month or so
over a question that should be decided in a night,
and it lost both opportunities.
Pity the Poor Paper Proprietor.
The Foreign-trade papers of Sydney are making
desperate efforts to kill the proposed 10 per cent.
ad valorem, duty on printing paper—but not in
their public columns. Those are filled with moans
over the hai’dships of the washerwoman with
. starch taxed, and of the working man who will
' h ave — so b —to wear a cheap Australian-made felt
hat, instead of a dear London-made one; and
there is scarcely a whisper in them about the
sorrows of the millionaire newspaper proprietor.
But in private, whilst no one of the “oppressive
taxes on the poor man ” is considered worthy of
the slightest amount of attention, an active cam-
paign is being carried on against the paper-tax.
The Bulletin has, by chance, come across an un-
signed circular which is being distributed amongst
country newspaper proprietors who are likely to be
influenced to the Foreign-trade view of the matter
by an appeal to their pocket interests. Ihe cncular
states that printing paper is made from spruce
pine grown in America, Norway, and Sweden,
and that there is no possible chance of its ever
being manufactured here. That at the outset is
a statement which has all the beautiful vagueness
and'masterly suppression of inconvenient details
of a George Reid budget speech. All paper is not
made of spruce pine pulp—and even if paper can t
be made here then the paper duty isn t a protec-
tive duty, but a revenue-tariff duty, find the
Herald, Telegraph, Evening News, and Argus
are all revenue-tariff papers, and the duty is exactly
what they have been crying for—in theory. 1 * ie J e
is a wail of agony that the 10 per cent, duty
will tax newspaper proprietors to the extent ot
£30,000 per annum; that the press is a valuable
auxiliary to the administration of public affairs;
and that it is a retrograde movement repugnant
to the spirit of British legislation (good old spirit
of British legislation !) to tax the capitalist
who invests his capital in that particular form ot
dividend-seeking enterprise. Under the paper du y
The Bulletin will pay a heavy whack ot duty. -But
it sees no reason why it shouldn’t pay, with the
prospect ahead of the creation o| a great Austra-
lian paper industry which will give it security of
publication in the case of foreign war. As things
are at present, a foreign war might cut off Aus-
tralia from paper supplies for twelve months and
absolutely stop the publication of the majority of
Australian papers. A 10 per cent, tax on paper
would be a reasonable investment as an insurance
against that event, viewed from any other point
of view but that of short-sighted meanness. Ihe
printed and unsigned circular from the agonised
Foreign-trade newspaper interest is accompanied
by a memorandum, also unsigned, but purporting
to come from the N.S.W. Country Press Associa-
tion, urging the addressee to “ use influence with
any member of the Federal Parliament he knows
against the paper-tax. The idea seems to be to
endeavor to terrorise the politicians, through the
journals which support them, into voting against
the paper-tax, irrespective of their convictions on
the subject. If that is not so, why tins private
pressure instead of public argument ? Ihe news-
paper proprietors of Australasia draw at least
£1 500,000 a year in profits, and, even if they had
to pay £30,000 out of that, without receiving any
compensating benefit, the grievance would not be
a very great one. But since there is reasonable
prospect of the duty leading to the establishment
of paper-mills, with consequent betterment ot the
continent as a field for journalistic enterprise, and
insurance against war risks, the newspapers
should reckon that they have got off very cheaply.
-V
Larceny of Brains.
“ Wurrym ” to The Bulletin
When the Federal Parliament can find time it might
bring in a littie Bill to deal with literary and dramatic
pirates. The man who has the acting-rights of a success-
ful play is the regular prey of the snide mummer in Aus-
tralia, and with little hope of redress. There exists in
New York—and I believe in London also—a so-called
agency which obtains a short-hand note of the dialogue
of such plays as What Happened to Jones,” and copies
of this pirated script are supplied at about £1 each to
the scores of bummer-mummer co.’s that infest the
smaller towns in the States, and, in less degree, those of
Australia. Charles Arnold is one of the worst sufferers.
“Hans the Boatman” and “Jones” have both been
stolen, and the only redress he has is in imagina-
tion. J. C. Williamson has had to drop promptly
and heavily on pirates. It is not the money that the
pirate gets by his performance of another man’s plays, but
the injury he does the other man, that is the worst
trouble. When Arnold played “Hans” in Perth the
public didn’t want any, because they had seen it played—
in a way—by a co. which had no authority to perform it.
Then, to come nearer home, there is the literary pirate.
You know all about that! F’rinstance ; a few years ago
you paid for and printed a yarnlet of mine, entitled
“ Murder or Mercy,” and four months later 1 discovered
that some woman had received a prize of one guinea from
Tit-Shots or Snap-Bits or The Scrap-Heap, or something
of the sort, for her story “ To End his Agony.” Now,
that story was mine, “ word for word and letter for
letter,” with the exception of such alterations as
suited a change of locality—“gully” to “ gulch, and
“horses” for “mustangs,” for instance. There-
fore the woman was simply an impudent thief,
and Tit-Shots, her receiver, had bought what was
your copyright, and offered it for sale in Australia. The
remedy for the trouble ‘ Let the law place the larcenist
of brains on the same footing as the larcenist of boots,
and make him liable to a similar penalty. Apply the
penalty also to the bookseller who, after one warning, sells
in Australia the foreign paper which contains my yarn
which you have bought. Such legislation would doubt-
less drive from the market a lot of the thief-rags, but
there are plenty of people who could survive the disaster
with as much equanimity as would —Wurrym.

Concerning Australian Militarism.
Authorities throughout the Commonwealth are
agreed that Australia must have a system of land
defence against aggression. A number of the
authorities—anybody with an opinion at all is
quoted as an authority—want to go in for some-
thing big in the way of an organised gang of
butchers. A trained populace to them is not
good enough. They want a real standing army,
ready to go abroad on conquest and national
breaking-and-entering. It is a pity, before they
yell for a real standing army, that they don’t sit
down and do some figuring. Australia, comprised
within the Commonwealth, numbers about
3,750,000 souls. Eliminating women, infants,
male adults under or over military-service age,
lunatics, infirm people, politicians, newspaper-
men, and Hassall, the Cow-Shaker, the num-
ber of male adults within the Commonwealth fit
for military service may be put down at 375,000
all told. Under a proper system of citizen sol-
diery on the Boer plan, this would produce, at the
least, a grand army of 250,000, which, taking the
Boer war as an object lesson, would necessitate a
foreign aggressor throwing about one-and-a-
quarter-million troops into Australia to get it
down in under two years to where the Boers are.
The cost of such a campaign to the said aggressor
—Boer war again as example—would be
somewhere about £750,000,000. This ought to
convince any sane politician or other person that
with a proper citizen soldiery Australia is toler-
ably immune from invasion with a view to con-
quest. Every male citizen over 16 should be
taught to shoot, also to ride and swim and walk
long distances. The standing army idea is either
going to be an absolute farce or a vampire of the
first dimensions. Out of the 350,000 fit males how
big a standing army is required ? If we are to pin
our faith on such an army to defend Sydney,
Brisbane, Melbourne, Perth, Hobart, Rock-
hampton, &c., &c., and to keep the land lines of
communication open in time of war, the whole
350,000 would be none too many. If we want to
aid the dear old mother country in some real big
international trouble, sending 10,000 or 12,000
raw levies as we did to -the Transvaal won’t be
much use. We should have at least 50,000 trained
professional soldiers ready for the service, and
would need to keep 100,000 on hand for home
affairs. Out of our national wealth, production,
and population this is a manifest impossibility.
Even if we raise a standing army of 25,000,
which would be quite a comic - opera pro-
ceeding for a nation with 3,000,000 sq. miles
of territory to defend, it would mean a tenth of
the fit males withdrawn from wealth-production
and saddled on the already small proportion of
wealth-producers. Anything that calls itself a
standing army—not the nucleus of a national
army —of less than 25,000 will be a farce ; any-
thing bigger will be mere vampire and incubus
and national misfortune. The obvious course is
the citizen-soldier array. The numbers of ouv
people, the size of our territory, and our im-
poverished condition, make anything else numeric-
ally, strategically and financially impossible.

The N.S.W. Stipendiaries.
The demands of N.S.W. stipendiary magistrates
that their tenure of office be made more secure
have only to be stated for their justice to bo
acknowledged. The principle at stake is a great
one. At present the stipendiaries, apparently, may
be dismissed at the whim of a Minister, and that
Minister very often a solicitor who may practice
before them. There have been some grave
scandals, and rumors of scandals on account of this.
There is nothing that can more shake confidence
in the administration of the law than the sus-
picion, now widespread, that the magistrates can
be moved by motives extrinsic to the merits of
the cases which they decide. Whether those
motives be the desire to placate irascible poli-
ticians or to prevent being circularised by the
“Department” —the results are the same. Until we
can get the ideal magistrate (who will be without
friends and foibles, and as ugly as he is just), we can
take away some of the overpowering temptations
that at present beset his thorny path, and give
ordinary fallible humans a chance of doing their
duty manfully “ without fear and without favor.”
In the first place, the salaries of the magistrates
should be as permanent as that of the Auditor-
General. Next, the magistrates should hold office
onthe same terms as Supreme Court Judges (or,
at least, in the case of dismissal, they should have
an appeal to the Full Court), and, lastly, a stop
should be once and for all put to the circulars
and other more-or-less corrupt “influence” issu-
ing from the “department.”
Treasurer Waddell was asked, the other night,
in the Assembly, if it was true that New South
Wales had borrowed large sums at different times
with which to pay interest on its debts. The
questioner was Meagher, M.L.A., and Meagher,
M. put his query in the shocked and incre-
dulous tone of a man who had just been informed
that polar bears were walking along Circular
Quay, and who wanted to know if this new and
astonishing statement could be true. And the
Treasurer repudiated it with the air of a man who
was doing a superfluous act, and refuting a slander
that was too absurd to need refutation. It was
a silly comedy on both sides. Qf course neither
N. nor any other State borrows ostensibly
to pay interest with, any more than a mis-
sionary goes out ostensibly to get Copra
instead of souls. There are decent reserva-
tions about (these things. As the interest
bill grew larger, without any corresponding
expansion of the revenue, and nobody wanted to
face the difficulty by new taxation, part of
the interest had to be paid out of new loans, or
something else that was formerly paid out of
revenue had to be charged to loans, so that the
revenue it formerly absorbed might be available
to pay interest with. It is the vastly increased
interest bill which drives N.S.W. nowadays to
spend about £1,000,000 a year of loans on unpro-
ductive works, whereas, 20 years ago, these works
were almost wholly paid for out of revenue ; and
that is the same—and yet not the same—as if
£1,000,000 a year of the interest was paid out of
new loans, and the works expenditure left where
it was. The fact is identical, but the name is
different. At the same time, the difference isn’t
worth growing excited about.

The alleged determination of Edward VII. to
get himself crowned Emperor of Hindustan at
Delhi will give no comfort to the many British
jingoes who can remember a time when the com-
mon sense of the nation was opposed to florid
official assertions of the “Crown’s” importance.
Twenty-four years ago the mere proclaiming of
Queen Victoria as Empress of India (George
Titheradge read the Viceroy’s announcement to
the crowd at Delhi) excited a lot of honest ridi-
cule, even in London, where the taste for royal
pomp and circumstance is kept alive by frequent
visits of foreign potentates. The public at large
didn’t take kindly to Disraeli’s suggestion. It
was attributed to his Jewish love of display. It
was an “ un-English ” notion, characteristic of the
man who wore a black velvet coat, and ringlets on
his forehead. Furthermore, cynics remarked that
all empires have been in the first stage of decay
when they started to attach undue importance to
the symbols of imperial power.
♦
There is a possibility even now that Victoria’s
Pecksniff Government will come to its grave
over the Old Age Pension Bill, and be buried in a
cheap pine coffin at the expense of the parish.
Turner’s original Act, providing a maximum
pension of 10s. a week, was a temporary measure,
and unless a new Act is passed the pensions cease
altogether. Premier Peacock promised the
House of 48 Rich Landlords that he would reduce
the maximum pension to 7s. a week, and though
it really wanted to abolish pensions altogether, it
accepted the promise in a grudging spirit. The
Assembly passed the clause with the 7s. a
week proviso. Then it thought better of it
and rejected the clause. Whereupon, Peacock
hurriedly proposed a maximum of Bs. a week,
and carried it by a narrow majority. Then he
thought better of it, and the debate was adjourned
to give a distracted Peacock time to get his
second wind and put his tail in order. Peacock
depends for his draggled political existence on the
democratic majority of the Victorian Assembly.
At the same time he hasn’t the courage to fight the
bitterly Tory majority in the House of 48 Rich
Landlords, and he tries to be agreeable to both
parties, which is just as hopeful as trying to be a
bigoted Roman Catholic Orangeman and a
Mohammedan Baptist at the Same time, and to
kiss the Pope’s toe on the 12th of -1 uly.
Sydney Harbor Trust has decided to
abolish all wharfage charges on exported goods,
and to make up the loss by doubling the wharfage
on imports. And whether an import duty is
called wharfage or customs or fried crocodile it
helps to protect local industry all the same.
Q. Premier Philp’s proposal to give an
extra vote to the father of two or more children
leads to the conclusion that when woman-suffrage
comes, as it will come, an extra vote must also be
given to the mother of two or more children. The
fatuous Philpties himself in a knot of absurdity.
Morituri.
Though resolute as Zenghis Khan
Your hoof-strokes follow on your ban,
And strip the land of leaf and blade,
And all the prospect man hath m. do.
Though every soul beyond the V.ial
Be pent within a captive kraal,
Or like a hunted outlaw creep,
To caverned haunt or kopje steep.
What then ?
Will any kindlier order haste
To clothe a land laid wholly waste ?
And that old order, will it die
In mute, unyielding agony ?
No end can come till facts like these
Rest on performance, not decrees ;
The one must come, the other go,
Nor rest, nor respite, can we know,
Till then.
Till then, and in the prospect bared
By that stern truth, all plain declared,
What phantoms rise, what shapes intrude,
Fire-scathed, steel-slashed, and blood-imbru 3d ?
Humanity must veil her eyes
When Time shows how a nation dies,
The end is nigh the prophets tell,
Fate waits to toll the passing bell—
But when ?

The King’s illness is said to have ended ;
other accounts hint at a grave throat trouble
caused by smoking.
A collision on a Roumanian railway be-
tween a passenger and a petroleum train furnished
the most appalling horror, so far, of this century.
Scores were burned to death in the fiery furnace
of oil. A millionaire from Crajova, named Dinu,
was caught fast by one foot between two beams.
He implored the engine-driver to hack off his foot,
promising to make him a rich man. The next
moment the flames licked him up. So great was
the heat that the earth on the spot became as hard
as granite, and trees for half a mile round were
turned into charcoal.
With memories in their hearts of Kossuth,
Hungarian bishops and clergy are petitioning
King Edward to put an end to the attempt to
smother the Boer Republics. A continental pub-
lic can’t quite understand how a nation which
gave so much sympathy to Kosciusko, and shel-
tered Kossuth and Mazzini, should on its own
account attempt such a murder of Freedom. Since
another disaster is reported, with loss of guns and
a big roll of casualties, King Edward would
probably please three-fourths of the British
people if he could see some way of “stopping the
war.”

The duration of the “ Christian King,” at
Her Majesty’s (Sydney), has been wisely limited
to two weeks. “ Man and his Makers ” follows
on Saturday. Alfred the Great has excited
only a mild sample of enthusiasm, despite
the three big tableaux and the other pictorial
advantages. He would have gone better if the
pious element in his character had been less con-
spicuous. People went to see an old-time figliting-
man of a fighting age—a monarch who left the
brains of his enemy on many battle-fields, and who
knocked his foe’s head against almost every tree
in England, and knocked it hard. And the stage
Alfred, even when he heard that the Danes
had crossed his border and were raising Gain
in a land where that person had been the
most frequent crop for many years, hung
around the court, offering blameless and
first-class observations, till his character as a
fighting man degenerated. The warriors who left
a big footmark on those troubled ages—a footmark
so deep that even a century afterwards the local
cow still found it handy to drink out of on a wet
day—such men as Harold Hard-Counsel of Nor-
way, and Canute, and Rollo, and the other
Harold who died at Hastings—would have left off
in the middle of the most beautiful remark that
was ever invented, and rushed to the front with a
large beef-bone, supposing nothing better was at
hand, if they had heard similar news. And
unless history belies him, Alfred didn’t
stay behind with the limelight on him when
trouble was about. Wilson Barrett’s desire to
bring out the moral aspect of the great King
makes him go too slowly. A king with less
aspect and more axe would attract the multitude
more—especially as the author is dealing with
that end of Alfred’s life which was mostly axe.

“The French Spy,” revived by Holloway
at Sydney Theatre Royal, is the drama wherein
England’s fate rests on a thin packet of paper
which is snatched from hand to hand and left
carelessly about in various places. Miss Ida
Gresham takes the part of the Spy Lady who
blinds herself to avoid betraying her lover.
George Chalmers, as Petross Romanoff, was killed
so violently on Saturday night by Laurence
Dunbar as a matter of national duty that the
corpse had some difficulty in saving itself from
toppling over the chair into the wings. . Miss
Helene Burdette is brightly and cleverly vicious
as the nice girl who wants to annex her rival’s
diamonds that she may wear them at the other
lady’s execution. Wm. Taite, as the Russian
variety of Johnny, and Miss Roland Watts
Phillips, as a music hall singer, do their best with
some rather dreary humor, while Kronstadt
Harbor and the snow-capped Boulevard of Paris,
with its live horse that puts the buildings quite
out of perspective, are as reliable as before. The
“French Spy” is quite a temporary revival, and
“ Dangerous Women ” are to renew their career of
sin and chloroform on Saturday.

The “10.30 Down Express,” where the
incriminating photograph takes the place of the
lost document, will continue for a while at Sydney
Lyceum. Ethel Buckley’s graceful but irrelevant
attiring of herself in snow-white, sailor-boy garb
still remains a pleasing item. The calm, quiet
entrance of the Express also appears to satisfy
the gallery’s craving for excitement, though
the train has rather a bad limp when it first
appears in toy form in the far distance. There is at
least £3 7s. 4d. awaiting the man who invents a
feasible-looking train for use in the far distance,
and a horse two inches high that will really gallop,
to represent the Derby winner at the remote side
of the course. Of course the toy locomotive is
always there, but then there is the ever-present
difficulty over the lack of a reliable engineer of
corresponding sizq. If the locomotive sticks, and
the trained cockroftch in charge loses his presence
of mind, then a person 18 times the dimensions of
the train has to come on and give the affair a
push. This spoils the realism. So far the “10.30
Down Express ’’ has avoided any serious disaster,
but the stage train is a precarious vehicle at all
times.

In the American war times a daily paper
used to stop its machinery five minutes for oiling,
and all papers after that were “ second editions.”
“Said Pasha” came out with a second edition of
that character at Sydney Criterion on Saturday
last. Except that the comic men were a trifle
more “slick” in their gags, there was no percep-
tible alteration in the piece. “Fra Diavolo” was
to replace “ Said Pasha ” on Thursday night, but
comment this week is impossible. “ Wang ” will
be staged on Saturday unless the unexpected
intervenes. The unexpected hadn’t intervened
up to time of going to press. There will be a
“Fra Diavolo” matinee on Saturday and a
“ Wang ” matinee on Monday.

are devoted to comic relief. In the next scene
the foreign wife and the comic relief and

battle of marriage-certificates follows. “I am his
wife ; here is my marriage-certificate ” (produc-

Sydney Tivoli has no change of any im-
portance this week ; Will Whitburn’s screamingly
farcical sketch “ The New Explosive ” being put
so low down on the programme that, by the time
it explodes, nobody has much time to scream. Miss
Dora Taylor keeps up to date with “the Auto-
mobile Girl, ” and Miss Florrie Ranger has a new
song “Captain Lardi-Dah.” For the rest, the
Tivoli performers give some appearance of change
by having their turns at different times—the
people who used to be 1, 2 and 3 becoming 3, 2
and 1, or something of the sort.

The crowded pomps and circumstances of
Bland Holt’s show at Melbourne Royal are now
well under control, and the voice of the people
declares “Hearts are Trumps” to be a mighty
fine entertainment in more than one respect.
Nobody knows why the author gave it that parti-
cular name, though his right to seize upon a
striking catch-phrase is fully admitted. The big
drama from Drury Lane is somewhat different from
other dramas. Its lines of trouble are not ruled
by a traditional villain, who smokes cigarettes
and sneers at his victim’s downfall. A hairy old
millionaire from Australia with an imaginary
grievance against Miss Ross is partly re-
sponsible for her grief, but, seeing that
she grieves in the latest Paris fashions,
and would have had nothing much to complain of
but for her own baccarat foolishness, the hairy
capitalist doesn’t amount to a calamity. After
buying up the mortgages on Miss Ross’s estate,
and reducing her to the necessity of owing her
hotel bill, old man Walter Baker discovers that
she is his sister-in-law, and her daughter, Harrie
Ireland, is the niece he has been longing for.
Whereupon he invites the family to come to his
arms and take back all the property, and be mil-
lionaires when he is dead. The chances are that
if the drama were to last long enough one of the
sassiety ladies would marry Baker and blight his
relatives’ prospects, but this awful probability
doesn’t appear in the story.
* * * *
Arthur Styan, as a lordly brewer named
Burford, is the polite skunk of the piece. He
goes to Albert Norman’s studio to get his portrait
painted in his scarlet beerage robes, and there he
happens to get smacked across the nose by Harrie
Ireland, who is so innocent and young—only 17 —
that she doesn’t care twopence for bachelor earls
with breweries behind them. She pays dearly
for the privilege of smacking Styan. The artist
owes him money, and he “takes it out”
in a picture —a study from the nood,
which begins at a portrait of Miss Harrie’s
head and is continued in the voluptuous
“altogether ”of another girl. When the vindic-
tive beer-maker contrives to get his improper
picture into the Royal Academy, and the British
aristocracy turns its artificial back upon the dear
girl who didn’t sit for it, Miss Ross cuts it out of
the frame with a penknife, and when the brewer
demands a reason for the mutilation of his pro-
perty, Miss Ross claims the sacred right of a
mother, and the curtain comes down upon her
wrath. John Brunton’s representation of the
Royal Academy is a wonderful scene, furnished
with 300 pictures in frames, most of them being
masterpieces to all theatrical intents and purposes.
The sacred Right of Mother also accounts for Miss
Ross bursting-up a music-hall “turn” in which
her 17-year-old daughter is engaged, but seemingly
the bad brewer has no sacred rights at all. Mrs.
Bland Holt, in the course of working up her
breach of promise case against the brewer, had
induced him to dance a can-can at the artists’
studio what time a cinematograph friend was
taking photos of the revel. The brewer’s indis-
cretion pops up as a Living Picture at the music
hall aforesaid, and he immediately pays
enormous damages to have it taken off.
This ought to warn all Peers of the Realm
against the error of ever dancing in their
robes of greatness whilst a strange man is
manipulating a miniature barrel-organ on a table
hard by. Bland Holt, and the Alpine tragedies,
and other notable features of “ Hearts Are
Trumps ” are held over for future mention.
Meanwhile, Miss Lillie Bryer deserves a note of
praise for her little sketch of a deaf marchioness
who is addicted to feeling iively and wanting to
do something. Also, Miss May Hesford in a very
stout character, is commendable both for her
stoutness and for her docility in going to bed
when ordered.
At Her Majesty’s, the revival of “The
Gondoliers ” for six nights only is quite as much
revival as the present performance can carry,
even at Cup-time. Looked at in the light of other
days, and listened to in any light whatever, it is a
very No. 2 performance of an opera that has
hitherto been well treated on J. C. Williamson’s
stage. Three of the principal ladies —Misses Chet-
wynd, Grace Palotta, and Elsie Moore (as
Casilda) —can’t sing their parts in the way one
expects to hear them sung by amateurs when full
prices are charged for admission. Moreover, the
Elsie aforesaid doesn’t act with enough intel-
ligence and experience to soften the effect of
her warble. Kenningham is an artistic success,
Bathurst might be a little better and a lot worse,
George Lauri does well enough as the Grand In-
quisitor, the animation and moderately-effective
voice of Carrie Moore make her an acceptable
Grionetta, and Hugh Ward is a Duke who doesn’t
fill the bill. Saturday (9th) brings a revival of
“ The Old Guard,” which only needs Lauri and
the ballet to make any reasonable audience happy.
A week later the Italian Opera co. will return
and sing.

The Broughs are not turning any money away
from their bright little show, at the Princess’s.
Melbourne is a very uncertain quantity as regards
patronage for the 8.C.C., and somehow “Lady
Huntworth’s Experiment” has failed to get
talked about. For that matter, the tale of the
Countess who rose from a state of degradation to
be respectable cook in a clergyman’s family
is not an exciting subject, neither is the
title attractive. It gives no suggestion of the fact
that Lady Huntworth hems pudding-cloths and
dumps his lordship under the sink. Australia is
a democratic country under the surface, and if
the heroine of this simple fruit-salad comedy had
been billed as “ The Mysterious Cook,” she would
probably have drawn larger audiences. “ The
Second in Command ” is due on Saturday (9th).
** * *
Also, on Saturday, the Hawtrey Comedy
co., at the Bijou, will try a change of programme.
The red-headed men have been sorted out in a
lunatic asylum for so many weeks that the season
has only one more week to live, and a revival of
“ Message from Mars ” is expected to flourish for
six farewell nights.

The Rickards bill at the Opera House is
much about the same as last week. Also, it bears
a close resemblance to what it will be at any time
up to the 23rd, when a great burst of new attrac-
tions will occur (d.v.).

Fitzgerald Brothers’ Circus continues to
cirque with great vigor under the new iron roof.
Probably the Diving Horses will shake up the
contents of the tank for the first time next Satur-
day, but the present rush of business doesn’t call
for the production of that four-legged novelty.
Wirth’s Circus is also back in Melbourne for this
week only, or a little longer, so the ardent lovers
of menagerie and gee-gee can wander from one
show to the other and draw comparisons.

“ Been There ” to The Bulletin :
The latest tale re Amy Castles was published by the
Argus last week on the authority of “private letters”
from London.” It is to the effect that little Miss Castles
was offered “ the chief place on the programme at the
Boosey Ballad Concerts which commence in London in
November.” All the established favorite concert singers
—Clara Butt, Ada Crossley, and Melba (?) are instanced—
appear during the Boosey season, “ so the offer is a high
compliment to the young Australian.” Also private
letters from London allege that Amy “ received an offer
to appear at the celebrated Kubelik Concerts,” but was
not to be tempted. Now, when a solemn publication
like the Argus circulates a statement of that sort,
the effect on the minds of numerous “budding
Melbas” and their admiring relatives is deplorable. The
girls—some of them—get sent to London to receive
tempting offers which never arrive, and after a sad
period of waiting for celebrity, they find themselves
penniless. It is so easy for a respectable girl and decent
singer to become a penniless stranger in a strange land.
Amy Castles, so far, is only different from a number of
other Australian girls who have gone ’Ome in that she
has a pile of money to repose upon. The statement that
“ she will make her platform debfit in London, at her own
concert, during next month ” (or later), is doubtless cor-
rect, for it. practically expresses the foolishness of the rest
of the paragraph. Why should a novice refuse pressing in-
vitations to make her debfit in distinguished company,
before an influential audience, in order to have a concert
on “ her very own ? ” The Castles debfit will, presumably,
be mainly an invitation concert, with Australians in the
front seats and all over the house, and a cable report of
the young artist’s “ brilliant success ” will be the con-
cluding item on the programme.

The N.S.W. Government is still using up the
rents from the resumed area of Sydney as ordinary
revenue, and spending them as it goes along. It hasn't
paid for these properties yet, and when it does pay, the
interest on the purchase money since the date of resump-
tion will absorb most, if not all, of the rents the State has
collected. And as the State has spent these rents, it will
presumably get over the difficulty by paying the back
interest out of loan moneys —which is another handy and
surreptitious way of using loan funds as revenue. This
is the situation in N.S.W. for the four months already
elapsed of the financial year, and for the corresponding
period of last year :

New South Wales has been relieved by the Federal Govern-
ment of over £300,000 of expenditure in the four months.
It has received back from the Federal Government
about £75,000 more customs and excise revenue than its
whole customs and excise amounted to in the correspond-
ing four months of last year when there was no Federal
Government. And with ail this extra revenue, and all
this great saving of expenditure, its deficit is £40,000
more than it was at 31st October last year.

N.S.W. is having a glorious boom in ordinary
expenditure, loan expenditure, and expenditure of other
people’s rents, and even the big revenue provided by the
new Federal tariff isn’t big enough to keep the boom
going. Taking October by itself, the revenue was
£933,613, of which £27,221 was rent derived from unpaid-
for properties in the resumed area, leaving a legitimate
revenue of £906,392. This was the first month under the
new tariff, and the new tariff gave N.S.W. such a lift that
the October revenue was £200,000 more than that of any
previous month this year. And yet expenditure was
£992,278 —close on £86,000 more than even this boom
income.

write down the bank’s holding of British consols to £90 —
another of the consequences of the Boer shindy. The

funds (capital and reserves) are now £2,569,160 ; cash
reserve is £3,154,822 ; and reserve of State securities,
£1,449,786.

Uneasy must lie the head of Q. Treasurer Cribb.
In his budget, delivered early in August, he based his
calculations on a return of £1,200,200 from Federal cus-
toms and excise. Treasurer Turner, who is probably the
most reliable man in that line that Australia possesses,
says he will return Queensland £961,138, which leaves
Cribb with a visible shortage of £239,062. There is talk.
of the Federal Government lending Queensland money to
help it tide over its difficulties, but the only money it can
lend is that of the other States, and see ing that they all
impose land and income taxes, and Queensland’s troubles
all arise from its refusal to do either, and from the
hideously extravagant management of the railways since
Matheson left, the idea seems wholly unreasonable.

The Colonial Sugar Refining Co. has just com-
pleted, to September 30, 1901, what seems to be the most
prosperous half-year in its history. Results compare with
some previous figures as follows :

Sept., 1901.. 93,930 10 „ „ 93,610 421,071
The co. has also a “ replacement and depreciation fund ”
of £483,955, and if this was added to the above reserves
the total would be over £900,000. But as the amount of
the replacement and depreciation fund is deducted from
the value of the assets, it is probably all required to pay
for wear and tear.
The Colonial Sugar Refining Co. makes some
sorrowful remarks about the losses of cane through frost,
but so far the world seems to be treating it reasonably
well. It also states that it is convinced that the stoppage
of Kanaka labor will “ cause the collapse of the industry
within the tropics.” Yet at the same time it says that
it expects to be able, under the new tariff, to pay the
Queensland farmer a higher price for his cane than
heretofore, (and also to do better for the N.S.W. farmer)
and an industry generally manages to avoid collapse
when the price of the product is going up. Further, the
co. announces that it has bought the Knockroe mill, near
Bundaberg, and expects to go in for work thereabouts on
a larger scale—so apparently there are compensations.
The co. seemingly doesn’t expect any general pegging-
out of the Queensland sugar business. Possibly it moans
rather from force of habit than from any other cause.

The Westralian Treasurer estimates the State
and Commonwealth revenue of Groperland for the year
to 30th June, 1902, at £3,417,000, which is £339,000 more
than last year’s revenue. Last year’s was the biggest
revenue Westralia has ever produced, and Illingworth
bases his theories on the assumption that he will beat it
badly. Yet he only hopes, after paying off last year’s
deficit of £74,839, to have a surplus of £2484. And even
then the expenditure out of revenue upon public works
is to be again cut down. Almost every year this item is
being reduced, and more and more of the non-produc-
tive but necessary works that used to be built out of
revenue are being charged to loans. The works vote was
£805,480 in 1896-97, and even after paying this there was a
surplus of nearly £35,000. In 1901-2 it is £303,759. The fact

The co. has a paid-up capital of £250,000, of which,
according to the balance-sheet, £ISO,OJJ is “to be writ-
ten off per shareholders’ resolution, August 31, 1894.” If
this has really been written off, then the amount may be
set against the deficit, reducing it to £333,862. But
even if the whole capital was written off it would still
leave things in this remarkable state :

and if the good times of the late eighties, when M’Lean
Bros, and Rigg used to earn £30,000 in one year, should
by any chance come back again, things may not be quite
hopeless even yet. All the same, this writer would like to
know what bank holds that overdraft, and what view it
takes of the matter. True, the bank’s position has been
worse—in 1898 the amount owing to it seems to have
been £418,066 (£230,994 of direct overdraft and £187,072
of past-due bills which it seems to have been holding on
to). Profits earned since then and an extensive realisa-
tion of securities have improved the position con-
siderably.

“Perplexed ” : The concern isn’t so bad as you
think. When a co. issues life policies for, say, £7,000,000,
that doesn’t mean that it should have £7,000,000 to meet
them. It should have so much that the amount on hand,
together with the premiums it may expect to collect from
these policy-holders before they die, and the interest it
makes on the investment of these premiums, will amount
to enough to pay its policies when they fall due. All the
same, don't insure in the co. you mention.

Bt. Joseph’s Investment and Building Society
(Sydney) looks a little better on the whole. Ten years
ag’o the institution had a paid-up capital of about
£lOO,OOO, and held about £300,000 of deposits. By much
writing down the capital has been reduced to £28,588 ;
the deposits are reduced to £93,556 and are being repaid
by instalments of Is. in the £ per annum with interest at
3 per cent., and all the earnings appear to go in an in-
terminable process of writing-down. Recent results are
these:

St. Joseph’s Investment and Building Society has its
paid-up capital of £28,588 still intact (on paper at all
events), and £237 surplus. It still owes £93,556 on
deposits. In view of its own figures its allegedly lament-
able position, and the need for all this writing off, and
the despondent tone of the directors, are hardly account-
able. This is the situation, on the solemn affidavit
of the balance-sheets :

This is the net return on productive and unproductive
assets, all lumped together. The net return on produc-
tive assets only is about £4 13s. 7d. per cent. The gross
return on productive assets only is over 6 per cent. If all
the interest, &c., shown in the balance-sheet is collected
in actual cash, and none of it is simply charged against
accounts, St. Joseph’s should offer its depositors an extra
£ per cent, on condition that they renew the balance of
their money for a few years, and stop sacrificing its pro-
perties to pay them off. Properties which yield over 6
per cent, gross, and over 4J per cent, net shouldn’t be
thrown away recklessly nowadays to pay off deposits that
only cost 3 per cent. —or even 3j per cent.

He reserves, which are multifarious, consist of reserve
fund, £57,000 ; re-insurance fund, £12,500 ; reserve for
equalisation of dividends, £2000; contingency fund, £8500;
and undivided profit, £10,031. Also there is £6OOO reserved
for unadjusted losses. The writing-off is mostly off the co.’s
Sydney office premises. The United has £68,226 paid up
capital, and £157,204 of invested funds. The only feature
which doesn’t look well is the decline in the receipts
from interest and rents. Assuming that the office pro-
perty (valued at £57,060) is wholly occupied by the co.
and yields no cash return, the other investments only
yield £3 6s. 3d. per cent., as compared with £3
17s. 3d. per cent, in 1900, and £4 4s. 2d. per
cent, in 1899. The present £3 6s. 3d. per cent is a
very low rate, even allowing for the fact that only
£lB,OOO out of £lOO,OOO is invested in mortgages. Even
N.S.W. Government debentures yield £3 10s. per cent.

Gastlemaine Brewery and Wood Brothers and
Co. (Newcastle, N.S.W.), with a paid-up capital of
£260,000, is only exceeded in point of capitalisation by
two brewery companies in the
to pay 7 per oent. dividends, but, in recent times, it has
dropped to a 4 per cent, level. The latest balance-sheet
is as follows: —
The co.’s principal asset is summarised in a large
way as “Freehold and leasehold properties, buildings,
machinery, plant, goodwill, rolling-stock, &c., £215,922
It it were possible to discover how much of this consists
of .the paper item of goodwill, and to deduct that
the £41,983 mentioned above, then the real reserves
could be arrived at. Goodwill is always a dubious item,
it is especially so in the case of a co. which earns Just
about 4 per cent., seeing that the shareholders could get
an almost equally good return out of Government securi-
ties ; and when the amount of the goodwill i tem is an un-
known quantity, so far as the balance-sheet is concerned,
the arrangement is extra objectionable.
* * *
The announcement made by .the Australian
Brewerv and Wine and Spirit Go. (Sydney) that it is
advisable to write off £48,000 out of the paid-up capital
of £96,000, is somewhat of a shock when set alongside tne
co’s balance-sheets. At June, 1892, the co. had assets to
the nominal value of £207,491, though part of this—
amount not known, it being lumped in with a number of
other assets—was the purely paper item of goodwill.
Since then it has written off £51,000 out of earnings,
and it has £40,035 in various reserves available tor
further writing off. This makes £91,035, or nearly half
of the total assets as they were in ’92. If a further
£48,000 is provided that will make £139,035. The profits
for the year ended 30th June, 1901 (set down as £7 uo),
though not much more than half those of 1894,
were still an improvement on either 1898, 189 J,
or 1900. And a brewery which, only a few weeks ago,
announced that it had earned a shade over 8 per cent, on
its capital—unless it didn’t really manage to collect all
these apparent profits—certainly doesn’t look like one
with a lot of unprofitable assets to provide for. A brewery
isn’t supposed, surely, to write-down its capital until the
earnings represent 16 per cent. Australia is full of beer
factories which, if they earned 8 per cent., instead of
writing-off half the capital would pay a 5 per cent, divi-
dend, add the balance to reserve-fund, and have congratu-
lations all round. The Australian Brewery and Wine and
Spirit Go. has announced its worst year’s profits m the
last nine years as equal to 1\ per cent, on capital; its
best year’s profits as over 15 per cent. The average
has been 11 per cent. It has paid, in nine years,
two dividends of 2£ per cent, and one of 5 per cent.
£9600 in all out of alleged profits amounting to £9.>,081.
It has paid no dividends in the last four years. And m
the last two years it purports to have made £14,700
profits—yet its liabilities to the bank and other creditors
have increased by over £12,000 in that short time. These
look like pretty large discrepancies.

that thev show nowadaysis atendencydownWards. In 1896
they were £32,160, so there is an average decline since then
of a shade over £lOOO a year. Under these circumstances
it looks as if the necessity for cutting down the dividend
to 5 per cent, would have to be considered at an early
date. The present fading process can’t be allowed to go

a fifth of the capital to be raised and give big concessions.

own wool and giving employment to its own workers ?

Dear Bulletin. —“ Canip ” (B. 12/10/’01) damns
with faint praise the Oallide Goal Co. He cannot attack
the genuineness of a show which Q. Govt. Geologist Rand
officially reports to be one of the biggest coal seams in the
world, so he warns possible investors that the railway
will probably cost £300,000 and not be completed until
1904. But the first section (21 miles) is practically ready
for construction, the estimated cost being £2200 per mile.
The tunnel scheme is only an alternative one and has
never been seriously considered. Anyhow, £300,000
would not be an extravagant figure to build a railway
and equip wharves, &c., for the development of a pheno-
menal coal-seam 60 miles from the second best port on
the Australian seaboard, but from £50,000 to £75,000 less is
going to suffice. The co. has a contract to start with for
500,000 tons per annum for two years. The port of Glad-
stone is land-locked, commodious and safe : 10,000-ton
vessels enter with ease. The Callide Go. is exceptionally
favored in proximity to a world’s highway, and should be
in full swing at the end of next year or a little later. In
fact, within 10 years this will be one of the most im-
portant mineral districts in Queensland. —W.J.M.

Proposed to combine and reconstruct the Lon-
don and Globe Finance Corporation, the British-American
ditto, and the Standard Exploration Co. The first was
practically the parent of the Lake View and Ivanhoe
mines. From these it obtained all its glory. It promoted
many wild cats —Mainland Consols, Hannan s Golden
Crown, and others ; the list is too long to enumerate.
Whittaker Wright conceived the brilliant idea of putting
all the “cats” in a bag and drowning them under the name
of the Standard Exploration Co., the working capital of
which he mostly used up in boosting the share-market. Ail
the spare money of the London and Globe was used in the
same direction. That co. also played a prominent hand
in the Victorian Deep Alluvial Estates of which Vic. news-
papers said a great deal up to last year —since then they
have been quieter than a graveyard. The British-Ameri-
can Corporation was ostensibly formed to promote
American mines, but most of its money was wasted in
trying to squeeze the “ bears ”of Westralian stocks, the
official receiver has told a gruesome tale of the manner in
which the funds of all three co.’s were manipulated by
Wright, who, up to a few short months ago, could do no
wrong. Balance-sheets were cooked just before meetings
of shareholders, and the money and shares borrowed from
one co. to brighten the affairs of the other were imme-
diately after the meetings returned. Why reconstruct
the putrid dead ?

Despite the fact that 8J years have elapsed since
the banking crisis, and about ten years since the
beginning of the building-society crisis (the building
societies began to crumble long before the banks), and
despite the gradual revival in the property market, there
is little joy in being a building society, or land co. 01 an Y
kind, even now. The following list includes almost all
the building societies and land co.’s of Sydney, Melbourne
and Brisbane which still remain sufficiently above ground
to issue a regular balance-sheet, and tell the public how
they are getting along. At least it includes all whose
balance-sheets the writer can find :

This is taking no account of institutions that
have utterly disappeared or are so far gone in liquidation
that they have ceased to issue regular statements of their
affairs. The list also takes no account of ten large Sydney
institutions whose very names have almost vanished since
1892, and a good deal more than ten Melbourne ones. It
is simply a collection of those survivors whose positions
can be traced, and the method of their surviving is an
interesting study. Both in Sydney and Melbourne, the
entire reserves of those institutions which have reserves
don’t add up to a sum that would pay off the shortage of
the one awful example that staggers at the foot of the
column. And when one considers the awful examples
whose shortage isn’t known, and the possibilities of the

This small concern appears to be looking up a little after
a long period of comparative stagnation. Another decent

Merton’s East (a Yio. co.): 40,000 shares of
£l. Two 24-acre blocks on the eastern boundary of
Merton’s Reward, W.A. The co. has been testing the
property by diamond drill, and the boss lately returned
with full particulars of the boring operations. “The
directors are so satisfied with the results obtained that
they have decided to at once purchase a winding and
rock-drilling plant with the object of sinking 400 ft. to
prospect the lode disclosed at that depth, and which
is a continuation of that worked by Merton.” But what
are the results with which the directors are so satisfied ?
Are they so good that they cannot be revealed ? Bore
revelations are, for obvious reasons, always to be taken
with a little salt, for (in gold-mining) they are very, very
hard to check.

Liquidation is now in full swing among M.L.
dredging co’s; many dead cats are being heaved pain-
fully and odorously overboard. In most of the co’s
floated during the late boom power was taken in the
articles for directors to lend to the co. Before the boom
collapsed, it was common for directors to enter into
“ joint and several ” to the bank or lender, and secure
themselves by a mortgage on the dredge. Many of
the securities to directors are being called up, and on
liquidation the directors buy the dredge. A large number
of dredges have thus passed into the hands of the late
directors of co.’s. And as they naturally lent on a safe
margin, good dredges that have done little or no work
have gone for a song, with the claim thrown in. Conse-
quently, many shareholders will have the pleasure of
seeing dredges built with their capital working profitably
in private interests. “Wrecking” is now a fine art in

If it comes to a fight, as seems likely, between the owners

use of “the oxide of the alkaline earth metals;” the
others claim to use “calcium sulphate, gypsum, or cal-

included in the former. But there are also apparently
differences in appliances, though these are not expressly

Contrary to what many people think, the
control by an Anglican Bishop over his diocese is
of a very loose kind, nothing at all like the abso-
lute despotism of his R.C. prototype. Thus, the
Anglican Bishop of Bathurst has actually been
hustled out of his cathedral and forced to take
refuge in the little suburban church of Kelso. All
Saints was the parish church of Bathurst, and
also the cathedral, with the Rev. Marriott as
parish priest and dean. Bishop and dean don’t
quite play speaks. In the R.C. Church that
dean’s valedictory purse of sovereigns would'
have been _ collected the moment he began to
disagree with his bishop ; but in the Anglican
fold the boss shepherd seems to have no real
authority over his underling sheep-tenders. So
the trouble between dean and Bishop of Bathurst
continued until now' Dr. Camidge lias to make a
more or less dignified - retreat from the big
Bathurst cathedral, and set up his episcopal seat
out in a remote little township.
TWO EVILS.
“My husband is positively impossible; he knows
nothing."
“Mine is simply unbearable—he knows every-
thing.”
Baronet Rupert Clarke announces his
intention to resign from the directorate of the
Colonial Bank, owing to the institution having
joined with the other banks in charging five shil-
lin ff s P® r ha l f year for keeping customers’ current
accounts. Speaking from the chair at the bank’s
annual meeting the Bart, said he had always tried
t< ? r w i tv Y g ,t, an< f regarded this charge as
absolutely dishonest. He knew that the other
banks bad forced the acceptance of the agreement
on the Colonial; but be declined to retain his
place on the board after it came into force. In
which pompous declaration the Baronet recalls
Boccacio s hero, who gained a great reputa-
tion for sanctity by confessing, with terrible
sobs, such heinous offences as that on Friday he
had picked his teeth with a bit of mutton-bone,
Ihe plain fact about the charge is that there are
hundreds of small depositors whose accounts are
only worth a few shilling a year in interest, but
who give constant trouble and use a certain
amount of stationery. The man who can see
anything dishonest in charging these people 10s
yearly is altogether too good for this world. He
is even too pure for Heaven.

Extract from the evidence given before
the Court at Wellington (M-L.) re the wreck of
the Ariadne
Stewart Willis, Lloyd’s surveyor at Lyttelton, stated in
evidence that the value of the ship afloat was £SOOO and
she was insured for £IO,OOO. Mumford had told him that
while working on the yacht Kerry gradually approached
him as to whether he would cast the yacht away. It was
eventually agreed that he should do it for £4oo—half
when the job was done, and the balance'when the under-
writers paid up. Mumford added that it would be neces-
sary to take the vessel to Maoriland, as the insurance
policy had almost expired. If the job was successful
nerry and he were to go home and purchase a larger
vesse heavily insure her, and lose her in the Straits of
Magellan. Mumford was to get £IOOO security from
Kerry, and a much larger sum if he wrecked the
larger vessel. Freke was present when arrangements
were made. It was originally intended to wreck the
vessel on the west coast, but that was abandoned, as the
life-boat had been lost. Kerry had signed an agreement
undertaking to pay Mumford £l2 per month while he
was master of the Ariadne, and £4oo' if the vessel was
totally wrecked, and handed a copy to Mumford. Mum-
ford lost it, and Kerry-refused to pay, but Mumford sub-
sequently found it. This agreement, together with Mum-
ford’s written statement concerning the above facts, was
produced in court this morning by Captain Willis,’who
stated that he had paid Mumford the £4OO promised.
It sounds improbable enough, yet the world is
full of people who put agreements like that in
writing, and then leave the incriminating docu-
ment on a shelf with . the cheese on top of it to
prevent it being blown away. ?■

The manufacture of the
motor-tricycle has already
begun in Sydney ; it com-
menced as soonas the Federal
tariff appeared on the far
horizon. The motor-tri-
cycle, provided it can be
sold for about £30 or £40,
is bound to become popular
in this country. The ordi-
nary motor-car is beyond
the reach of the man with
a £3 or £4 per week income
who lives in the city. He
can’t afford stabling, and
there is no room in the
ordinary city dwelling for
a motor-car. Also, it wants
a small man or a large boy
to look after it. The tri-
cycle, on the other* hand,
can he kept in the wash-
house, or almost anywhere,
and as it is now being ex-
tensively made to carry a
chair in front for the wife,
or for somebody else’s wife,
it is likely to come into
much more general use. A
cheap long-distance machine to
carry two is what is needed in this
land of vast distances and diminish-
ing birth-rate.

“Melb.” : The committee
of our leading suburban Presby-
terian Kurruk was lately seized
with a brilliant idea. There was
a series of Sundae-evening com-
petitions for the billet of pastor.
You would see the preacher,
with tears in his eyes, imploring
the congregation to come and get
saved, while they sat like critical cocka-
toos with their heads on one side. When they
came out the buzz and cackle ran thus, “What
d’ye think of him, eh?” “Um—pretty fair,
considering, but not a patch on Macßunthunder.”
“Oh, dear no!” So Macßunthunder got the
billet. What glorious humbug !
George Reid’s progress from Melbourne to
Sydney, on his way to hold his demonstration and
“uprising of the people” at Sydney Town Hall,
wasn’t a very good piece of stage-management!
The alleged “ demonstrations ” at various Vic-
torian towns en route didn’t demonstrate, and the
huge, spontaneous and enthusiastic gathering at
Albury—though telegrams were sent along the
wires in ad vance urging that the population should
turn out en masse and be carried away by the
exuberance of their feelings—was a small, rather
silent gathering of about 80 people. The only
thing to be done under these difficult circum-
stances was to telegraph to the Sydney morning
papers that 2000 people were there, and that their
joy at seeing G. Reid amounted to frenzy, but
even the most persistent telegraphing was a poor
substitute for the real thing.
A point overlooked up to now in regard to
Melbourne University has been
the poor pay given to assist-
ants who do valuable.work,
but have not the rank
of professors. There
is much sweating
done under the ,
highly-paid
profs.
HER PREFERENCE .
CECIL : “Don't you think that woman , as a
rule, prefers a man who is her master? ”
ETHEL : “ Not at all. She prefers one who
thinks he is.”
N.S.W. Judges in Banco have upheld a
conviction, before Judge Fitzhardinge, which was
appealed against on the ground that that Judge
directed the jury “ to contrast the evidence of an
apparently reputable person, with the statement,
not on oath, of the prisoner, an apparently dis-
reputable person.” It was maintained that this
was an infringement of “Meagher’s Act” for-
bidding a Judge to comment on the fact that a
prisoner declined to give evidence on his own
behalf. The Banco Court held that Judge
Fitzhardinge’s instruction to the jury was not an
infringement of the Act in question.
Which decision is, of course, so ridiculous, on
the face of it, as to be worthy of a bench of back-
block beaks. N.S.W. Parliament should have
another try at persuading the judges to put in
force its decision on the point, or else should enact
that an accused, on giving evidence, shall not be
subject to cross-examination, or abolish the whole
system of accused persons giving evidence. As
things Stand now, what was meant to benefit an
accused is, by the Judges’ interpretation, turned
against him.

Yet another Sydney “ casual ” story. A
young woman, standing at her front-door, was
last week accosted by a slight acquaintance, so
slight that, beyond knowing her name was
“Millie,” the young woman knew but little
about her. A third woman, with a baby in her
arms, strolled up to the pair, and Millie intro-
duced her friend—“ You know Maggie, don’t
you ? ” She didn’t, but Maggie looked an affable
person, and so she “s’posed she did.” Soon after
Maggie announced that the baby wanted a drink.
Would the young woman hold the infant while
she went for some water? She assented cheer-
fully. Ten minutes and no Maggie, so Millie
decided to go and hurry her up. No Millie or
Maggie ever came back, and as severe cross-
examination failed to shake the baby-holder’s
story, the asylum received the little one. Should
this meet the eye of Maggie, she will hear of
something to her disadvantage at the police-
station.

Extract from Foreign-trade paper’s report
of the proceedings of the anti-tariff meeting at
Sydney
Mrs. Dalton rose to speak amidst cheers. “Barton,”
she said, “was going to tax mangles, starch, patent
medicines which we want to save life with, and all the
things the poor people use. (Cheers.) The noor people’s
boots were included ; he is going to tax* the babies’
bottles. (Laughter.) What will become of us ? What
will become of this lovely country, with its beautiful
plains and its fertile valleys—its broad expanse of en-
closed waters? (Wild cheers.) They want to drag us
all down to the level of that stinking cabbage-garden,
Melbourne. (Laughter.) I am only a washerwoman,
with a sick husband and two children to keep, and
yet I am to be taxed to help Melbourne and Victorian
industries by paying more for the things I buy. (Cheers.)
When Barton was before the country during- the
Federal campaign, he was the man—Australia’s noblest
son! What do you think of him now? Oh, you men,
you great boobies! (Laughter.) Fancy taxing the
washerwoman’s mangle! We want wise men in the
Parliament at the head of affairs—not goats. (Roars of
laughter.) While they put heavy loads on every article
which poor people will use, they are going to let the
rich people off. (Cheers.)
Mr. David Dash moved that the meeting be adjourned
till next week.
And Barton, as it happens, isn’t taxing the poor
old frantic lady’s mangle after all. Australia
manages to make its own mangle in a general way,
and, as there is no excise put on it, the weary
implement is just about where it was.
If cabbies were to start gossiping out
loud, how would society be shaken to its
foundations !

Fn.m a letter by Trooper G. H. Ann field
of Bernma(N.S.W.) published in Sydney Even-
ing News: J
We burn all the houses we come across and take the
family into the town That is if we are close; and if
not we turn them adrift.
Just turn them adrift—women, children and
babms-to starve in a desolated land. Apparently
the theory is that if the housefather, Private
bchmidt, took Ins rifle and went to the front with-
out asking questions when the order came, as
nvate kiclimidt does in every land when he is
called upon, the destroying of his house, and the
torture of his family by cold and hunger and ex-
posure, or by imprisonment in a foul concentra-
tion camp where nearly one-third of the prisoners
die inside a year, may make him surrender Of
course he may have been killed himself long ago
m which case the maltreatment of his family can't
accelerate his surrender. Or he may have been dead
before the war commenced, in which case his
widows house is burnt, and she and her children
thrown out 011 general principles. What a howl
of scorn and hiss of derision there should be next
time the British swaddy gets up in the six-act
melodrama to state that the man who lays his
hand on a woman, except in the way of kindness
is unworthy of the name of Briton !

In advertising for a fresh batch of 100
foot-constables—restricted to ex-cohentingenters
Vic. police authorities state the men will be
tested and carefully selected: “The Victorian
police are a splendid body of men, and the
physical standard must be maintained.” Nothing
is said about the moral standard. What a 'lovely
body those police will be presently when im-
proved by a choice leaven of farm-burners fowl-
sneakers, and other light laborers !

Still another returned cohentingenter has
]?® er } sen t oli ced to three months for burglary in
Melbourne, and two others burglaries are charged
against him. After 18 months of house-breaking
and arson m South Africa the average contingenter
is about as undesireable a person as anybody
could meet on a dark night.
* * *
The man held chiefly responsible by many
for “smirching the fair name of” Australian
cohentingenters, by causing those Victorian
mutiny trials, is an officer of the contingent who
overheard a camp fire remark and repeated it to
Beatson. Certainly, the eavesdropper had little
sense. But a fair name plastered over by the
letters from the front,” published in Australian
papers, can contemplate an extra fly-speck or so
with equanimity.

The young man—librarian in a Mechanics’
Institute at Norwood, S.A. —who reported that
two burglars had burst into the premises at night,
gagged him, hung him by the wrists from a ban-
nister, and dabbed a red-hot key on him till he
told them where the money—the £lO5 he had
saved up for his marriage—was located, is now an
exploded citizen and a bounced man. He
has confessed there was no burglary, and
no money lost, and that he wasn’t fired
with any hot key. The bosses of the establish-
ment have resolved to dispense with his services,
regarding him as a young man of riotous imagina-
tion who ought to be riding on a turtle along with
De Rougemont in Torres Straits. It doesn’t appear
whether he had lost his money and didn’t like to
explain to his best girl—who was, no doubt,a really

was the exact nature of the trouble. This country

an ingrowing toe-nail, or met with some other
small misfortune, and who try to account for it by
inventing a huge, wild tale of 18 armed bush-
rangers provided with dynamite and howitzers.
Wherefore there is urgent need for a Bureau of
Feasible Explanations—an establishment to which
anybody may go in his hour of need, and explain
his difficulty, and be provided with a handy lie
for eighteenpence and corroborating circumstances
for 2s. Od. An immense number of people require
such an establishment —the engaged people who
are tired of each other ; the person who has been
out late ; the person with a black eye or a stove-
in hat; the individual who didn’t answer his
inother-in-law’s letter ; the person who is short in
his casli ; the one who urged his friend to back the
wrong horse; the person whosaid he wrote the book
or article or poemthatwas written by the other per-
son ; the man who said he had committed the great
adventure which, as it transpired, really happened
to someone else ; the man whose young wife has
seen him coming home on Cup Day with his feet
out of one cab window, and his head out of |the
other while he sang “John Brown’s Body” ; the
man who has be&i sitting up all night with a sick
friend who is quite well; and Most
of all, the ordinary person, male or‘female, with a
small salary, and a deadly-dull existence, amd
cheap brown clothes, who wants to be something
unusual—who wants to get out of the rut of life,
and have an adventure, and get the commonplace
name of Bill or Mary Ann mentioned in the
papers. To all these the Bureau which will
supply a Coherent Lie for eighteenpence, or a
Feasible • Explanation for one-and-six, with
half-a-crown’s worth of corroboration, will appeal
strongly. Most people think lying is an easy and
simple art —which it isn’t. Then they invent a
story about being attacked and robbed by wild
giraffes on t..e coast of Switzerland, and wonder
why the public doesn’t believe them.

Apropos the Norwood (S.A.) Institute
bogus-burglary-and-hot-key-torture affair, it is now
remembered that only a couple of months ago the
Institute was found to be on fire, and the librarian
(wlio resided on the premises)' explained that he
had been wakened soon after midnight by a
suffocating sensation, and found the place full of
smoke. Considerable damage was done.

N.S.W. Anglican Bishop Chalmers in ex-
planation of the S’African trouble :
Whilst Britain desired to treat the African colored races
according- to the tenets of the New Testament. the Boer?
BOUGH.
HUSBAND : “ Tm not very well to-night. I think I must have
caught a touch of barcoo.”
WIFE (bitterly): “ Yes, saloon-bar-coo! ”
insisted on the right of treating the Kaffirs upon the
teaching of the Old Testament.
What a dear, simple, credulous, old gentleman
Dr. Chalmers must be if he really believes that
England was summoned to S’Afrma by the Cohens
of the Rand to fight against Old Testament treat-
ment of the niggers ! And it doesn’t look well for
a parson to thus disparage the teachings of two-
thirds of his inspired scripture. The parson says
that the Old Testament is the Word of God, and
actually complains that the Boer follows its
teaching.
The signing of a church
register in the vestry does
not, seemingly, constitute a
legal marriage in Great Bri-
tain unless the tabernacle
has been consecrated. Any-
way, the Commons lately
passed a Bill to legalise cer-
tain marriages which had
taken place in unconsecrated
churches. After all, awoman’s
safest plan is to lead her
victim into the office of a
hard, worldly registrar, and
there fix up the union in a
businesslike manner.

The announcement of the resignation of
Bisho’' Goe seems to have been the signal for a
rattling of the Anglican Church cash-box in Vic-
toria. There is even some talk of an effort to
raise a steeple for St. Paul’s Cathedral.
The Sydney City Reform Council, in its
nine months of office, has endeavoured to clear up
tliG mvstery which has shrouded lown .Hall
affairs." It has shaken up the staff, and has prac-
tically called upon every man and every system to
show cause. Those old-time officers who thought
it better to manage the aldermen than to do the
city’s work have come a cropper. The committee
system, introduced for the first time, has given
the aldermen a grip over the administration,
which was formerly in the hands of a despotic
mayor and a “ keep-it-dark ” staff. If the Council
had its powers decently increased by Parliament,
it would yet do good work in the corner of
Sydney—for it is only a corner—which it governs.

statutory powers : (1) City Corporation, (2) Subur-

Resumption Boards; the Australian Gaslight

Weights and Measures Board; the Inspector-
General of Police, the Railway Commissioners,
the Park Trustees, the various ferry co’s., the
Harbour Trust, the Electric-power co’s., and the
O’Sullivan. Oh for a combined Sydney, under
one Government !

has started to compile the medical history of every

pull a card out of a rack, examine it, and
tell you : “No 5 Nebuchadnezzar-road -on

An alleged big Melbourne defaulter, now
awaiting trial, seems in no way abashed by his
troubles, and, at recent race-meetings, appeared
to thoroughly enjoy himself among the bookies
and a following of admiring associates. At Caul-
field, he was openly pointed out to the ladies by
their male acquaintances, and surpassed all others
in point of interest, but did not appear flurried in
the least.
The Melbourne lady who seized upon
Joseph Nobbs, of Sydney, and demanded that he
should be handed over to her as her strayed hus-
band, has struck two snags. Joseph Nobbs says
that he isn’t her husband, and another man has
been found in Sydney who thinks that he (the
other man) is. Even after this evidence came to
hand the plaintiff adhered to her story, and cer-
tainly the person found in Sydney appears to be
a most casual and unfinished individual, whose
tale is partly obliterated by the haze of beer and
great distances. The man who thinks he is
married to the woman who thinks she is married
to Nobbs says that lie was drunk when the event
happened, that he only lived three days with his
wife, and that he would hardly know her again.
He only identified her by telegraph, and seeing
that the lady, after inspection of his photo.,
repudiates him utterly, it seems quite pos-
sible that he really married someone else
of the same name, or that he was wedded
to a jim-jam in a dream. Things are so
unsatisfactory that the best idea might be
to pass a short Act declaring that the lady, who-
ever she is, is divorced from her husband, whoever
he may be, and assuming that she had one ; that
everybody concerned may now start afresh ; that
all possible prosecutions and aspersions are off;
and that the lady shall receive £lO out of the
Consolidated Revenue on general principles.

Madame Melba’s “official” announcement
of her forthcoming visit to Australia, published in
S.M. Hekald, is a remarkable document. She
says:—
I believe that on many occasions rumors have been
published of my intention of going over to sing in my
native country, but they have never been authorised by
me until now.
That is to say that these misleading statements
are now “ authorised” by her. Again :
I am looking forward to a visit so full of potential plea-
sure.
Does she mean that there is no absolute certainty
as to the pleasure ? And, finally :
If by the exercise of my art I am able to add some joy
to the lives of my countrywomen and countrymen, my
happiness will be complete.

Sydney Evening News on the Ramsay’s
Bush outrage (after printing a portrait of the man
accused): —
Arrangements are to be made to enable the victim of
the outrage to see her alleged assailant.
It should be contempt of court for a newspaper
to publish the “portrait” of an accused person
until all identification proceedings have ended,
for it absolutely destroys the value of the test. Of
course, in the case of the News, it could always
plead in defence, contempt of Art, not of court,
since no one would identify the original by the
portrait.

A WOMAN'S LETTER.
__ Sydney, November 5, 1901.
Mi Dear Arini,—
In my suburb a young debating-society had on
the notice-board, as a subject of debate for this
week, “The Melbourne Cup : —A Deviation in the
Moral Standard.” The affirmative speaker that
was-to-be had made out a capital case, and had
tried his speech on the dog. A friendly animal
was the dog, and there was a lot of him, and after
the paper he said : “We shall stick where we are,
like the axis of the earth. We shan’t deviate
from the moral standard—we won’t go to the
Cup.” But the paper never came into debate
because the writer suddenly departed Cupwards,
and, when the dog asked wonderingly, “How did
he get the money to go?” the negative speaker-
that-was-to-be answered—-“He won it in a sweep.”
The exodus Cup-wards from all the capitals
has this year been unusually large. Eight Pullman
sleeping-cars, every berth occupied, slid out from
Sydney on Thursday, in addition to numerous
special waking cars. And up to Sunday night
the Hegira to the equine Mecca, by land and sea,
was numerous and swift and strong.
I do not vouch for the originality of this Cup
story, but if it is a chestnut it is in good preserva-
tion. Two girls had hoarded up their odd three-
pennies till the necessary pound was saved and
despatched to win the big prize in Tatt.’s big
sweep. First, they learned they’d drawn a horse ;
and then, simultaneously, they received a demand
from the owner to be laid several thousand pounds
to nothing, and a notification that there was
£27,000 waiting for them in Sydney. So they
journeyed down, took a room in a reputable
hotel, and went and cashed the cheque. They
brought it all home in a cab, carted it up to their
room, and locked themselves in. They were
absent at dinner-time; they failed to put in an
appearance at tea, and were missing at breakfast
next morning. So the manager’s wife went up
and knocked, and, receiving no answer, she
brought a pair of steps and looked over the fan-
light. They had spread the wealth out on the
floor, and as the bewildered manageress looked
6 lv ? r y nymph lay down and rolled right across
the glittering surface. As she got up she remarked,
‘Hurry up, Sis!” Then it was noticed that
their ivory forms were both as red as boiled lob-
sters —they had spent the previous twenty-four
hours rolling in wealth
Another—and a fact. He was a clerk where
about 25 other clerks were employed, and when
the organising spirit appealed to him to put in
his little bit of wealth to make up the £2O he
refused, saying that among such a crowd £27,000
wouldn’t be worth having. So he went “on his
own,” and when all the tickets came back it was
found that his solitary lone ticket was next to the
syndicate’s last. And it won. When the cash
came to hand the clerk handed in his resignation
with all the haughty aggression of the plutocrat,
and marched out of the office, and married more
wealth. In a week he called round and invited
his fellow-clerks to a “banquet.” They rolled up
m force, and the musical genius of the crowd sang
a paean of triumph which he had composed in
honor of the occasion, and accompanied himself on
the zither. Speeches were made, toasts were
drunk, and then, after a pause, Plutus rose to
respond. He thanked them for their kind wishes.
He had no idea he was so popular. He asked
them to consider the excellence of the spread.
He begged them to remember that he had married
almost as much wealtli as he had won, and he put
it to them as men of the world to say if he hadn’t
done the decent tiling by the “chaps.” The
chaps swore he had. He agreed, and went on to
dilate upon the utter impossibility of any man in
his financial and social position recognising every
twopenny-ha’penny clerk, and requested them as
a personal favour not to presume to know him in
the future when they met him in the street. And
the staff rose up, dusted its boots, marched
silently downstairs and home. They never pre-
sumed to know that fortunate young man again.
Melba has spoken. And nothing short of death
or mutilation will now stay her from unrolling her
in Australia. The manner of announcement
of her visit would be fitting for the queen of a
realm, let alone song. It should have read,
Epistle to the Commonwealth.” But it is to
Musgrove she comes, not to Williamson. As was
pointed out some months ago, the latter would
have had to take the Town Hall and cram it
every night to make any profit. Her Majesty’s
I heatre, at its fullest, is worth only £3OO a night
Melba asked of Mr. Williamson £5OO a night, 10
per cent, of the proceeds, and her own and maid’s
passages, and the engagement of a certain French
tenor.. If she had appeared in opera, for which
she stipulated, there would have been the army of
“others,” and the miles of scenery. As it is,
Nellie ” will appear on the concert platform
only and if Mr. M. is to make anything out of
the deal she must have come down several storeys
111 *{ er terms. People are now speculating
whether “ the series of concerts for the benefit of
the poor and sick of my beloved country,” which
Melba appears to have proffered a while ago (on a
top note) will now occur. I fear that unless prices
are much lower than those ruling in London (10s.
up in the “gods”), her compatriots will know
more of her personally than vocally by the time
she has gone again.
That sweet soprano, Antonia Dolores, gives the
first of a series of four farewell concerts at the
Town Hall on Saturday, 9th inst. She will be
assisted by Clarence Newell, the American
pianist. Last time the smiling Dolores sang to us
was at the State Concert, with the King’s son and
the King’s son’s wife in the audience. To hear
Dolores sing “Jerusalem” (the old Crusaders’
song) is to know what an acquisition she’ll be to
the warrior-crowded hall of Valhalla.
Madame Ella Russell, one of the prima donnas
of the Musgrove opera troupe, sends her latest
portrait, taken for the Gloucester Festival. It
shows the Boadicea-iike singer in an unstudied
attitude that she must have taken months to
acquire, and her gown looks as if it meant to check-
mate every other gown at the Festival. It is an
Jtmpire robe, and seems to be accordeon-pleated
panne with embroidery of flowers, leaves and
knots on the front. Talking of singers, the aspir-
i- ast ? s —despite the experts’ entreaties
to he low and practise hard ” for another couple
of years—is coming out ” at her own concert
next month.
At Sydney Liedertafel’s smoke-concert, last
week, in the Centennial Hall, the galleries were
full, and the blushes of red and flashes of blue
among the blouses made the crushed mass of
woman-kind look like bands of Liberty silk or
helds of corn with masses of cornflowers and
poppies waving among them. Above gleamed
the six great pallid arc-lights ; all around, festoon-
ing the dark, oaken galleries, the glitter of the
mcandescents. Along the foot of the towering
organ, row upon rows of faces, looking like sugar-
pops on a giant wedding-cake. The faces were
the Liedertafel. Down in the body of the hall
were red-covered tables around which sat white-
haired and bald-headed men, whole regiments of
bald-heads. Between whiles they waved tri-
colored pennants, and white-coated waiters darted
wherever the flags waved, vanished, and suddenly
re-appeared with trays and bottles. There
was clinking of glasses, spirals of blue smoke
and an odour of Turkish cigarettes floated
up, mingled with the deeper perfume of
cigars—not all made in Habana. The blue
spirals formed clouds and banks that drifted
along the galleries and made the garden of women
look more far-off—and consequently more beauti-
ful. Ihe Liedertafel sang its part-songs well
The best item was “Ever of Thee.” Other
gems were Mr. Peterson’s rendering of “Take a
pair of Sparkling Eyes,” which was enthusias-
tically encored. The audience was particularly
impressed by Laurance Phillip’s interpretation of
Sonata, Op. 7. There was no effort perceptible.
Ihe music came in clear, sparkling notes that
floated out from a masterly touch. Mr. Stevenson
roused enthusiasm with Wieniawski’s violin solo
Adagio Elegique, a beautiful piece of music
that haunts you like the memory of your first love-
affair.
The Espinasse matinee is fixed for Nov. 21.
All the professional companies in Sydney wili
assist. That pretty little piece, “ Her Good
Name, will be presented, and Mme. Elsa Buhrow
and Mrs. Espinasse will play a French comedietta
entitled, “A Lady’s Maid.”
National Gallery Trustees have bought
Reid’s “Evensong” (35 guineas), a landscape
m the gloaming, with meditating horses in the
foreground. Also Sid. Long’s “Circular Quay”
(40 guineas), and Howard Ashton’s little “ Harbor
View” (15 guineas), and some small frames of
mack-and-white work by Leist and Garlick.
From the extraordinary publicity given to
the fact that the Trust asked that certain
alterations be made in Long and Reid’s pictures
you would think that such a request was quite un-
usual. As a matter of fact, the Trust, except in
one or two cases, always demanded minor altera-
tions m the pictures it has bought from both
societies. The letter by which the Trust
informed the president of the Society
of Artists that the pictures had been
bought was not at all indefinite, yet an almost flat
contradiction of that letter was sent to the press
after it had been made public. The Trust wants
a little brumby in Reid’s canvas altered and a
cloudlet in Long’s sky made cloudier.
On Saturday next the Society of Artists will
hold a conversazione in their gallery, and in the
following week Mrs. M'Millan, Mrs. Roberts (of
Greenoaks) and Mrs. Kirkcaldie will have at-
homes. Mrs. Wills-Allen’s reception will take
place towards the end of the month.
Miss Buckey, the lady we imported from
America some three years ago to start the Free
Kindergarten, is being farewelled by her friends,
previous to her return to her own country. Mrs’
Dane, the widow of lecturer Major Dane a
daughter of Mr. Sam. Cook, of the S.M. Herald,
will probably carry on the management of the
schools. One is at Woolloomooloo, one in the
vicinity of the Rocks, and one at Redfern. Free
Kindergartens are intended for poor children
under State-school age. The charity seems to be
a pet one—for the Government voted it £5OO the
other day. A fourth ’Garten has been established
lately at Bowral. Now, does Bowral really
require a free infant school ? A number of voices
are saying that it does not.
Writes my Melbourne correspondent:—
“The Derby was a bit of a blazer, the heat un-
expected, but sunshine the much-desired thing so
chiffon and muslin led the cake-walk, and gay
parachutes cast rosy and greeny hues on the per-
ambulating flutterers. The two vice-regal pens
were packed to the utmost. The Gov.-General,
in dark-grey, button-holed with pink baby-roses,
nipped a cigarette between his gold-specked
teeth whenever possible. Small blame to him if
he did feel like ‘fleshing his tusks,’ for with nota-
bilities m need of propitiation cropping up every
second, no one on the Vice-regal premises, except
« seeraed prepared to spare an ounce of
affability. He tripped half-way down the steps
to meet Prime Minister Barton, ushering him
with pomp and ceremony into the shy, stiff
presence of Lady Hopetoun, and having got him
there, palpably wondered how to effect his
rescue. Solid, phlegmatic ‘ Toby ’ being at
last extricated from his tight corner, his
late host skipped to the partition between
the domains of Governor Major and Governor
Minor to joke, and chattered over the fence with
George Reid, who sat prattling to the Lieut. -
Governoress. Mr. Reid looked very lorn and
flabby; he limped on one leg, and was sadly in
need of a Samaritan to remove a white thread
dangling from his coat-tail. Another identity
taking his Derby sadly was dapper solicitor
Croker, who, as steward, escorted taciturn Lady
Hopetoun to be-ribbon the winner.
“ Ex-Mayoress McEacharn, in grey satin, early
relinquished the attempt to keep in line with her
restless and energetic lord. Lieut-Governoress
Madden, toqued prettily in gold-net and pink-
roses, appeared fagged by the heat, as did Janet
Lady Clarke, less noticeable than usual in lilac.
Rupert’s cousin-in-law, the stunning-figured Mrs.
Lawson, with big bright blue ear-rings, coral neck-
lace, and large black feather hanging over each
side of her hair, displayed a strong barbaric ten-
dency.
“ In the gold and blue box, the figure of yellow-
haired Miss Rawson, in white tucked muslin and
cornflower-winged hat, was the most attractive.
The Countess, in salmon pink—a sort of mayo-
naise—was a tall, bright, telling figure—but not
smart. Mrs. Corbet sat quietly in the box all
day ; the aides did her betting. At times, the
Countess grew chatty, and leaned across the
dividing rail to exchange remarks with the Wax-
elleney’s family. All round the two boxes was a
thick fringe of gazers, who glued their eyes on the
representatives of Royalty, as if they were the new
consignment of Esquimaux dogs at the Zoo. From
the terrace, too, wanderers from the Never-Never
gaped at the two boxes with open mouths. The
brood of a prominent Victorian notable love this
sort of thing—they lap it up, and pose accord-
ingly.
“ The palm for open-work frocks must be given
to the handsome daughter of a Judge, who bared
a square expanse of white neck to the sun-kisses.
It was even innocent of the apologetic scrap of net
or lace, and had none of the usual necklets and
dangles to take up the lily-white space. There
were many trellised arms, and open-work necks,
but none had the audacity of the lady in question.
Mrs. Torn I airbairn, in her grey, clinging muslin
frock, was the most rakish figure of all the Terrace
Personages. The freshest and most florid figure
in a much-stared-at contingent of Clarkes and de-
pendencies thereof was Miss Hilda Cumming,
whose muslin frock owned a multitude of French
roses.
“The dame of Rupertswood was almost eccentric
in her out-distancing smartness. She led by
much more than an intelligent nose in the race of
well-groomed frockers. Miss Vera Clarke showed
her slim figure in an exceptionally-smart Frenchy
frock of pale blue Oriental satin relieved with
slashings of lace insertion.
“Of all the theatrical trippers doing a turn on
the lawn, the well-known figure of Evelyn Muret,
of the Comic Opera Chorus, was the only one
worth a lingering look. She was in white silk,
with expensive layers of lace running up and down
and across and around, leaving only one allotment
a clear space, and that for obvious reasons—
E.M.’s figure is a thing of beauty. The Brough
partners strolled round, the versatile better-half
doing all the bowing and talking. An actress of
very festive intentions merry-go-rounded it in
a shimmering blue silk, that, made over an
American corset, left nothing to be desired. In
view of a prominent politician’s sadly-garbed
girls, it was quite refreshing to gaze upon that
chubby cherub, Mr. Gillies, and reflect that he
had no daughters to dress.
“ A picturesque woman in white was Mrs.
M. H.R. Isaacs (looking over six feet high and
under 20 years of age), her long frilly white train
sweeping out over the green grass, while her
handsome profile and pink cheeks asserted them-
selves despite her drooping rose-garlanded “shep-
herdess ’ hat. This toilette attained its aim of
showing up from a distance, and its wearer
enjoyed, moreover, the all-day companionship of
a foil, in the shape of a short lady in hot-looking
blue.
A tour of inspection to eye the extra trim-
rmngs to the vice-regal snuggery at Flemington,
on Wednesday, was mainly attended by a racing
clique, with here and there a frocky dame from
Toorak. Of the crowd, Robert Harper’s daughter,
in strawberry pink and cream fixings, took the
palm.
“The new suite of rooms for the G.G., which
the secretary_has created under the Grand Stand
at Flemington, are infinitely more vice-regal than
the old original rooms where the State Governor
sought seclusion at meal-time. The G.G. apart-
ments are situated nearer to the betting end of
the stand, and the approach to them is down a
flight of steps terminating in a spacious
hall, retiring-rooms to the right, and
luncheon saloon to the left. His Ex’s
colors are duly asserted in the amber hail,
and the blue saloon. Both color schemes are
very effective, and the plush hangings in particu-
lar a triumph of Byron-Moorish decorative art
Instead of braiding the blue plush with gold, Mr.
Moore struck what is seemingly a new idea. ’ The
embroidery pattern is printed in gold-leaf on the
curtains, and whilst a trimming would have spoilt
the hang of them, the stamping makes it perfect.
A mechanical linnet trills delusively from one end
of the alcoves off the saloon and a splash of water-
falls mingles with the popping of corks as the
lions and lionesses feed.
“There was something absolutely pathetic
about the figure of Mayor Gillott at the head of
his own hop, m the Town Hall, last Monday, It
wasn’t the sense of his unworthiness that weighed
upon his soul, but his mien showed the strain of
duty a haggard, smileiess look. He pump-
handled as many of the throng as came forward *
then, when the hop had been started and no one
was looking, sank into a chair. When the V.R.
party came in, the lines of care deepened on his
brow, and his shoulders drooped under the addi-
tional load. The Mayoress stood proudly to her
guns. Her smile, someone has suggested, must
have been glued on—it was beyond human dura-
tion. Her Worship was a stout, robust figure in
a sweet-17 pink satin, with matronly helpings of
black velvet. The M'Eacharns looked on at their
successors with just a suspicion of amusement, the
ex-Mayoress sporting a new splendid spike neck-
let of diamonds.
“ A feature of the Mayoral ball was the correct-
ness with which the opening Lancers was got
through. The flock of onlookers pressing up to
the invisible line of contact with the Set of Some-
bodies had nothing much to laugh at, unless it was
the steam-roller figure of John Forrest (whose
frontage flamed with gilt and medals) dancing
with the ‘ Cliveden ’ dowager, well buckramed
and jewelled, and conspicuous for a smile as patent
as the Mayoress’ beam. The only other pair who
earned a laugh from the gallery were Betternot
Wally, beside Alfred Deakin’s tall daughter.
Wally bent a gentle ear to her talk, and
looked more along the Rubicon of his nose than
ever. Miss Deakin is very niee-featured, and has
that attractive 18-carat colored hair. Her white,
girls’-speech-day sort of dress was the most artless
turn-out in the room.
Another noticeable circumstance was the un-
bending of the Countess. Her dress was of white
satin, with a gay pink velvet corsage, and her
snowy manner was enlivened with a pink gaiety
to match, She smiled and talked to anyone within
radius of the dais, as she sat in the midst of the
s tifny-s tarch ed W axellency family, turning' her head
from one to another, with an air of animation.
Once she caught sight of the proudest and poorest
of all the dames about, and Her Ex. actually
nodded chummily and stepped down from the
sanctuary to chat to her. ‘Think of that,
Hedda ! ’ Sassiety notices that Her Ex. bobs
her knee in the lancers, in the old-fashioned
Betty ’ style, or, for those in touch with court
circles, like the lady-in-waiting to Royalty. A
Hebrew gentlemen, who shall be nameless, made
a presentation to the Governor-General of a
button-hole of boronia during the evening. His
Ex. took it with a bow, and pinned it politely in
his coat.
A fashionable set filled the Princess on Saturday
night, when the Broughs faced a house of many
gaps. In the “ Cliveden ” party were two notable
Sydney figures -Mrs. Burdekin, handsome in
grey and white, and Mrs. Claude Macdonald, in
black, cut down almost to the waist with a turn-
over of fine lace, and in her hair a pair of Mepliis-
tophelian horns in jet and sequin. Mrs. Torn
Smith shepherded her two spruce girls and some
smart chappies. Mrs. Willie Robb, in virgin
white, languished like an Eastern exotic and
furled a fan the size of King O’Malley’s “sun-
downer.”
“The Frivolity Music Hall scene in ‘Hearts
Are Trumps ’ is the most ‘ complete set ’ that Mr
Holt has ever staged. The Music Hall is ‘ built
up with snug private boxes on either side, a
dress-circle populated by an audience partly
human, partly wax, and partly painted by the
scenic artist. Borne visitors from Government
House went ‘ behind ’ the other night and enjoyed
the novel experience of sitting in the mimic circle
of the Frivolity whilst Frances Ross leaned over
the ledge of a private box on the grand tier and
called Harrie Ireland to account for daring
to sing at such a place. Captain Corbett, Major
Willoughby, the Countess’s brother Demmolines,
and one or two other johnnie personages were the
amateur supers, on this occasion. Since then,
there has been a rush of Toorak applications for
the same privilege. It wouldn’t be a bad idea for
the management to sell a limited number of
‘double d.c.’ tickets for each performance. The
d.d.c. ticket—extra-priced, of course—would en-
title the holder to go and be a super, in the
music-hall scene and get a full view of the Theatre
Royal from the circle opposite. They do say that
His Ex. has been one of the audience at Bland
Holt s Fri volity, but his distinguished patronage
was disguised in blue spectacles and a sham beard.
“Charlotte Hemming, ‘the Australian story-
teller, at her first recital since she got back from
Ome, wore white satin, striped with lace in-
sertion. Iwo or three flat flounces smartened the
plain skirt, a knot of gold-tagged black-velvet
cords relieved the whiteness of the fussy, low-cut
corsage, and a tiara added dignity to a successful
coiffure ; but, in spite of fine feathers, the home-
coming bird looked just the same shrewd, sonsie,
humorous colleen sue always did. Just the same
with her performance. As of old, she serves up
a taste of buttery Irish brogue, or a bit of
simple Dutch pathos to perfection, but she
was born comic, and all her high-toned English
experiences have failed to make her tragic. Like
the rest of us, she wants to be an orange, though
nature meant her for an apple, and t’other night
she turned the lamps low and toiled through a
despairing sort of ballad, depicting the reverie of
a mourner to whom Death comes in the guise of
a she-serenader accompanied by a piano and, I
think, a ’cello. Not my idea of a peaceful pas-
sage ! A snug crowd filled the Atheneeum on the
night of the Hemming recital. Janet Lady
Clarke, in her coat of pearl grey brocade, brought
Mrs. Maudsley. Somewhere else in the hall,
Cesca Vollugi, in all-black, caught my eye.

Botha’s name for the British Coinmander-
in-Chief is “Lord Can’t-Catchener.”
“ J.A.G.” : He “ wireless telegrams ” (8.,
26/10/’01). The term “ airgram ” wouldn’t fill the
bill, because the messages could be sent equally
well in vacuo (as far as air is concerned). They
are assumed to be conveyed by the space-pervad-
ing “ether,” that medium of high elasticity and
inconceivable tenuity by the undulations of which
heat and light are transmitted.
No less than tons of Australian rabbits
were recently condemned on arrival in England,
and had to be destroyed. It is pointed out that
opening the refrigerators—to land portion of the
cargo at the Cape—lets in a current of warm air
which damages the frozen stock. Thus a cargo,
though despatched in good condition, will be unfit
for human consumption when landed in England.
General Hector Macdonald, on his arrival
at Adelaide, when pumped by a reporter as to
whether he had his eye on the command of the
Australian army, countered “Have Australians
really got an army ?” Which was cruel after all
our deeds of farm-burning patriotism.
Labouchere, in Truth, says that as he
feels no misgivings as to the spiritual condition
of the King, he cannot understand the necessity
for surrounding him with so large an array of
divines, and that considering the differences in
the Church of England he trusts that they will
never be called together to give unanimous advice
to His Majesty. King Edward has two reverend
deans of the Chapel Royal, four reverend clerks
of the King’s closet, two domestic chaplains,
14 chaplains in ordinary, 33 honorary chap-
lains, five priests in ordinary, and five
honorary priests in ordinary—a total of
65 spiritual guides. His mother had a
much smaller clerical retinue, her divinity estab-
lishment including one dean, one sub-dean, one
clerk of the closet, three deputy clerks of the
closet, two organists, one domestic chaplain, two
readers, and five chaplains—a total of sixteen.

‘ Smiler ” Hales, “doing” the German

Cardinal Moran has an interest, through

sold to M‘Lauren Brothers for £20,000.
THE GLORY HAD DEPARTED.
IN.S.W. Premier See has dropped the title
of Chief Secretary, which he assumed for a couple,
of months, and reverted to the old one of Colonial
Secretary. The change of designation needs, it
seems, an amendment of the State’s Constitution
Act. But if that be literally so, what comes of the
documents signed Chief Secretary during the
period of erroneous assumption ?
C. S. Dicken, who has passed a long
lifetime in Queensland’s London Emigration Office,
takes six months’ leave as preliminary to a pen-
sion. Few high officials have been kept so
systematically on a string. Mcllwraith, Griffith,
Dickson, and Philp severally promised him the
Agent-Generalship when next the office fell
vacant. But when it did become vacant, there
was always a Ministerial hanger-on dumped into
the billet.
To anyone reading the late
G. B. Barton’s forcible and caus-
tic criticism of the Herald, the
explanation of that journal’s
apology for an obituary notice
is at once understandable. In
his “ Poets and Prose Writers”
Barton wrote re “ Literature of
New South Wales ” :
Soon after its appearance a “re-
view” of it was published in the
leading journal of the colony, the
Sydney Morning Herald. The malice
prepense of the article was obvious ;
but the writer used his weapons so
clumsily that, as Rogers said of
Oroker when he “ reviewed ” Macaulay—“ he at-
tempted murder but orffi- committed suicide.’ - . . .
It is curiously true that throughout the whole of
its existence—and it has now (1866) reached its
thirty fifth year—bins journal has never possessed
the slightest reputation for literary ability. So far
from possessing any such reputation it has been a
public laughing-stock on the score of its imbecility. The
evidence on this point is both written and traditional ;
as regards the present, it may be found in the journal
itself. For the last 35 years every contemporary journal
in Sydney has ridiculed the intellectual weakness of the
Herald ; and the ridicule has been echoed by the public.
. . . From the first to the last it has possessed the re-
putation of a twaddling, narrow-minded publication,
bitterly opposing every man who has raised himself from
obscurity at the same time that it chants the praise of
wealth ; defending every abuse until it is exposed, and
then claiming the merit of its exposure ; possessing no
influence over the political destinies, and retarding rather
than advancing the intellectual development of the
country.
How different is the S.M.H. of to-day ?
Lawyer Sam. Gillott looks rather unselfish
in consenting to be re-elected Mayor of Melbourne.
Having got knighthood at his first attempt,
so to speak—in which respect he was luckier
than his predecessor, M‘Eacharn, Samuel
might have been excused for pleading that his
state of health wouldn’t stand any further mayoral
expenses. The proverb that money makes the
Mayor to go admits of two constructions. Some-
times money makes him rush out of the billet.
An amusing old man, with a thick brogue
and a thick appreciation of a joke, is Stanley,
M.L.A. (Vic.) Whenever Reid is billed to speak
in the Federal House, Stanley rolls up early to
get a front place in the reserved gallery, and
simmers over the circus jocularities of the Free-
trade idol. When G.H.R. was letting himself
loose against Barton and co., Stanley, hanging
upon every word, with his jaw slackened, ready
to get in first when the time came for a laugh,
was a memorable incident.
Prompted, perhaps, by some recent Bul-
letin paragraphs, N.S.W. Freetraders talk of a
“national testimonial” to G. H. Reid. The
result of last N.S.W. elections seemed to show that
G.H.R. is practically essential to the importers’
cause, and that without him its flag has to
be hauled down without a fight, and used
as a cloth with which to tie up a very sore
head. So, on the principle that the ox which
treadeth out the humor should have something to
smile on, Reid ought to get a solid gratuity from
the people whose cause he represents. And he
should see that he gets it ere proceeding to
sacrifice the rest of his life to the Calico Jimmy
crew.
By the death of C. E. Dekker, editor of
Sydney E. News, the Australian press loses a
bright and interesting personality. He had not
stolidly crept up to his editorial position by going
through the wnim-horse round of reporting, sub-
editing, and leader-writing, but coming to
Australia for his health’s sake, when just on the
edge of a big reputation in Europe, dropped at
once into work which gave his individuality
expression. His writing, strongly flavored with
Parisian and American influences, was always
vivid and bright; sometimes its humor was
a little far-strained, at others it made Evening
News leaders altogether delightful. Mr. Dekker
drew on a rich fund of anecdote to garnish his
opinions, and would make entertaining copy out
of the most unlikely materials. His health
had for long been a trouble to his many friends—
his good heart won for him much affection—but
the end was unexpectedly sudden. He died a
bachelor, aged 50 years.

King Edward does not share his late
mother’s respect for John Brown. The statue
erected by Her Majesty to Brown’s honor and
glory has now been carted away from Balmoral
grounds—to the stone-mill. Queen Victoria kept
all J.B.’s old apartments locked and sacred, with
brass plates to John’s blessed memory on all the
Walls. King Ned has given the apartments over
to vulgar uses, and sold the tablets for old brass,
and now there does not remain at Balmoral a
single hint that John Brown’s body was ever above
ground.
The whole truth about the recent reception
in Melbourne of a certain distinguished visitor
was too sickening for even the Argus to print.
At one private shivoo given in his honor, after the
singing of patriotic ditties by a professional song-
stress, the hero was surrounded by a squirming
crowd of men and women lickspittles, who
slobbered on his hands, and even lifted his legs
and openly and unblushingly kissed his boots ! The
songstress asked the visitor, later, how
he liked that kind of thing. “Poor
things, they think it pleases me ! ” he
answered, as if speaking of the inmates
of an idiots’ retreat, who had to be
indulged.
The Times has reprinted its issue of a
century ago, and in it is found the following:—
“ The Irish baronet who is on his way to Botany
Bay has gallantly written to take leave of the
object of his affection and his crime. ‘Other
lovers,’ he writes, ‘feel momentary raptures for
their mistresses, but show me one besides my own
self that is transported for life !’ ” The baronet
was Sir Henry Hayes, transported for life for the
abduction of Miss Pike, a wealthy Quakeress of
county Cork. Hayes lived at Yaucluse and was
pardoned after 10 years’ residence in “ Botany
Bay.”
Percy Spence, the well-known Bulletin
artist, has now a good and assured - place in the
London world of black-and-white. He has secured
a permanent position on the Sphere staff, with a
guarantee of one page weekly at 12gs. In more
than one recent issue there have appeared two or
three pages from his clever pen. He represented
the Sphere at the fleet manoeuvres, and followed
the King to Homburg, acting as artistic spy while
he drank the waters. His two-page sketch of the
torchlight funeral procession of the late Empress
Frederick of Germany was a remarkably fine pic-
ture.
Some of those proposing to raise a
national fund to enable Federal Opposition leader
Reid to retire from the Bar and devote all his
time to the importers’ propagandism, map out an
annual subscription, with trustees and treasurer
and secretary. Georgey-Porgey will not be so
silly as to endorse the project. That was the old
scheme under which constituencies contracted to
pay salaries to M’s.P. Reid must remember how
the system ate the heart out of David Buchanan,
and sickened even the strong-stomached Jacob
Garrard If, indeed, his admirers will raise and
lodge with trustees for his credit as many
thousands as will give him a sufficient annuity, he
might trade with them ; but he will run risks of
miserable days and nights if he trusts to his
admirers coming up to the mark year after year.
Reported again that Seddon is to be
appointed an Imperial Governor, this time of
Orange Free State. Perhaps it is Richard’s own
feeler. But after he has stood on the steps of the
Colonial Office long enough, Mr. Seddon will at
last know that the mere fact of his being useful to
the Empiah as Premier of M.L. will prevent any
billet coming his way. When he gets into Oppo-
sition, he may hope to be marooned on some un-
healthy tropical island or other with the bone of a
small administrative billet to gnaw ; but England
has no use for men of his stamp in any position of
real glitter. They are graciously allowed to peel
potatoes at the kitchen-sink, as the power is in
them, but they are carefully kept out of the
Imperial drawing-room.
William McMillan is a Wesleyan on all
sides. His father, Rev. Gibson McMillan, was
the son of a Methodist parson, and married a
Methodist parson’s daughter, Miss McArthur,
s sterof the late Alexander Me Arthur, who left Ire-
land for Australia many years ago with a pack of
goods, and gradually expanded into a wholesale
“rag” firm. Another uncle was William
McArthur, who rose by relentlessly hard
labor and thrift, from carrying goods with
a donkey and cart for his employer in Lurgan
(Ireland), to be Lord Mayor of London. McMil-
lan married en seconder noces the daughter of
another Wesleyan parson, who was sent to Paris
by the London Wesleyan Society asinissionary to
on vert the heathen Parisians.
There have been 17 English Princes of
Wales, but only eleven of them survived to be
Kings of England. Edward the Black Prince,
Edward of Westminster (son of Henry VI),
Edward (son of Richard III), Arthur Tudor, Henry
Stuart, and Frederick Louis Guelph all died
early. Of the eleven who reached the crown,
Edward 11, Richard 11, Edward V, and Charles I
died by violence; Henry V died young from
natural causes ; Henry VIII was a bloated gentle-
man with a bad temper, six wives and an
ulcerated leg; and George 111 was an idiot in his
later days. And Edward VII attains the crown
with, according to common report, an incurable
disease fastened upon him. The princedom of
Wales has brought no great luck to English
monarchs.

“Jaf.”: European scientists are once
more calling attention to the ruthless destruction
of insectivorous birds, and the consequent increase
of plant-destroying insects. The Australian bush
is being depleted of birds, and chiefly through the
universal use of poisoned pollard for rabbit-
destruction. In the N.S.W. western districts the
wild turkey is almost extinct, and in this (Junee)
district, where a few years ago birds abounded,
hardly any are left—magpies, pine-pigeons, &c.,
all, alas, are gone.

“ W.S J.” : Re the suggestion of “ Yia’s ”
(B. 14/10/’01) that a list of edible native plants
should be published, with their qualities :
It is wonderful how few bush-people you can get to
cook “greens” of various descriptions. At Warren, a
year or so back, when cabbages, &c., were unobtainable
at any price, a shower brought up a plant that simply
took possession of all the land for miles round. It had
not been seen for years, but was recognised by backblock
experts as “ boggabri,” and pronounced to be a dainty
vegetable and excellent diuretic. But nobody would
give it a trial, and, although I asked that some might be
cooked for me, I am still ignorant of the flavor of bogga-
bri. Again, an excellent vegetable is “ fat hen,” of a
spinach flavor, but much more delicate. So with our
wild-spinach, a coast plant, far ahead of the garden
variety for luxuriance and savor. Many wild yams also
are tasty, and worth looking after, but some poisonous
sorts are difficult to distinguish from the edible kinds.

WhUe collecting the 1901 census out Birdsville way I
passed, while following the Diamantina down, the remains
of a cattle-station, which, in early days, had been
tenanted by a lone stockman with two domesticated gins
and a black-boy. The gins looked after the humpy and
milked the cows. One morning, as they were carrying
in the milk, two troopers rode up and shot them dead-
afterwards riding to the house and demanding from the
stockman the services of the black boy to pilot them
across the Diamantina, which was then in flood. The boy
guided them across, and, as he was turning to go back,
one of the troopers fired at him, but missed. The boy
dived into the water and swam across, the policemen
missing several more shots at him. The shooting of the
unfortunate gins was professedly on account of a murder
committed by the blacks many miles away.
Again, while going from Birdsville towards the junction
of the Eyre and Mulligan rivers, I passed a spot known as
“ Mooney’s Grave.” Mooney left Birdsville with 24 bottles
of whisky and rum, on his way towards Oarcory Station,
and was found dead a week later 30 miles from Birdsville.
Round the corpse, in a circle, stood the 24 bottles—empty 1

Dear Bulletin. — Re cruel treatment of
blacks (B. 23/6/’01). Last September a drover up
this way got a 9-year-old darkie apprenticed to
him for 7 years to learn droving and horsebreaking.
The boy ran away, but the drover caught him
again, and after severely flogging him with a stock-
whip, tied him to a horse’s tail and turned the
pair adrift. Court case. Owner fined £10; boy
sent to hospital.— Westbalian.

writes this time I wish to say that, so far as
rn T experience goes, the term pre-eminently
bestial ’ is not an exaggeration as applied to the
conversation carried on ‘ after tea ’ among diggers,
bush-workers, and navvies when camped, even in
small numbers. And I don’t consider a man to
b e p rur ient-minded simply because he sickens
with scorn . for a lot of ‘human brutes,’ whose
native bestiality is for ever bubbling out of them,

MAN FROM DIM DISTANCE
(looking for missing mate,
to wayback constable’s little daughter): “Hello,

up now, ’cause they keep him awake of nights
with their row.”
New cure for sciatica —described by the
experimenter :
Couldn’t stand the pain anyhow. Drove into township
to see the doc., who gave me a liniment to rub on. Went
in again next day and told him it was no good, an’ to give
me something that would burn. Gave me a prescrip-
tion. Chemist wanted to know whether doc. hadn’t
made a mistake, and told me to be careful, anyhow, and
only apply the stuff with a feather. Went ’ome, dipped
a feather in the bottle, and rubbed it on thick. Felt
nothing. Got a rag, poured a lot on, and daubed it all
over the part. Still felt nothing. Poured some into me
’and, and rubbed it in real ’ard. Felt nothing. Took a
sip of the stuff. -Tickled my throat a bit and made me
corf, so I slung the bottle in the lire, and the darned
stuff went up the chimney in a blue flame. Went across
to the blacksmith’s, got a flat piece of iron made white-’ot,
an’ ’eld it close to the part till the skin began to peel.
Went to bed, and got up next day with sciatica gone.
It’s never come back ; and if ever you ’ave sciatica, take
my tip an’ try the white-’ot iron.
This may be no exaggeration. The actual cautery,
a radical remedy, has been used, as witness Henry
Stuart Russell’s anecdote in “The Genesis of
Queensland,” about how, smelling burning flesh
one night, he got up and went into the tent of
explorer Leichhardt, whom he found holding the
big nerve of his upper arm over a candle-flame as
a palliative for his agonising neuritis. And there
are other instances.

“ T.G.F.” : Be crocodiles in the water-
holes of the Lower Bogan (“D.8.,” 5/10/’01): —
Some years ago I was told by an Australian aborigine
on Murrawambie station (L. Bogan) that, in the old days,
the “ boowinnie,” or crocodile, used sometimes to put in
an appearance in flood-time, mostly disappearing when
the river went below summer-level. It was very rare for
one to remain until the river had become a chain of
water-holes. When the reptiles appeared the Bogan
natives used to remove from the vicinity of the river.
One tribe possessed the skeleton of a half-grown crocodile
said to have been killed in the Bogan in the early years of
last century. At Wallan Billan, Bogan River, some years
ago, I saw in a collection of aboriginal weapons and orna-
ments a well-carved image of a crocodile.
Carefully cut into a gum-tree half-way

“ Gnoram ” : Re tree-climbing foxes. Out
shooting, a couple of months ago, near Bendigo
(Vic.), I noticed a dead slightly-leaning tree,
which had scratches all the way up. My mate
climbed to investigate, and when he had ascended
half-way a big fox jumped off the tree. Measured
distance, and found it to be over 30ft. The
hollow in which the fox had been lying was only
about Bin. deep. Have since got 19 foxes ; two
from the tops of straw-stacks, and the re-
mainder out of hollow trees. The foxes in most
eases ascend the outside of the tree and sleep in
the hollow spout.

Up Quean beyan way a bush girl of
17 got into service at a pub. She had
never been to church ; and, first time
she was going, some of the funny men
told her that a plate, with money,
would be passed round for each person
to take at least one coin. When the
plate arrived the girl grabbed the
biggest coin—a shilling —which she
duly pocketed. The warden let the
thing pass until after the service,
when he followed the purloiner up and
tried to explain. But he was a long
time trying to make her begin to see
things ; and a policeman had at last to
be called before she would disgorge the
leading resident’s contribution.
A.B.C. : Be aboriginal burial customs
(“ H. 5..” 8., 29/6/01) :
The following account of the interment, in ’49, of Hong-
gong, the last of the chiefs who ruled in Queanbeyan
(N.S.W.) district is furnished by my mother, whose
father was present at the ceremony by invitation of the
tribe. Hong-gong, a man of powerful physique and
ferocious nature, ordered his tribe to take him to Cuppa-
k’wambalo, a distance of 20 miles, that he might die and
be buried there. Borne on a sheet of bark on the shoul-
ders of his men, the old savage was taken thither, and a
few days later he died. Scarcely had his breathing
ceased ere he was disembowelled, and his fat was divided
amongst the men of his tribe. The sinews of his knees
were severed, and the body doubled as closely as possible
and bound with bark cords. Meanwhile the gins, utter-
ing a loud, continuous wail, piled the materials of which
the camp had been constructed into a circle. Near the
summit of a hill, a grave was formed by making a hole
about 5 feet deep, and then tunnelling about a spear’s
length, horizontally. At the end of the tunnel the corpse
was placed in a squatting position, and with it a roast
’possum, some crushed maize, and the old warrior s
weapons. The shaft (only) was then filled with stones and
earth, and above was raised a conical mound about 4ft.
high, out of the centre of which stood an upright stake
4in. in diameter. This stake was capped with a cone of
clay. My grandfather was asked to give a name to the
hill, and he naturally suggested “ llong-gong’s Hill,” but
the blacks did not like to hear the name, so “ Chief’s
Hill ” was substituted. The tribe then left the locality,
and did not return for six months ; and none of them
would thereafter pass “ Chief’s Ilill,” by night or
day, without carrying a lighted torch, which was held on
the side towards the grave, while the face was kept
averted. <

“Trav.” : Recently, with a Yankee mate,
I struck a Victorian township on the evening
before the annual show, and after vainly applying
for accommodation at the three main pubs., we
sought a fourth, kept by Mrs. O’T. Here like-
wise we were told that no beds were obtainable, but
as tea was on the table (laudlady at the head of it)
we sat down. My mate, who sat next to Mrs.
O’T., made a great show of crossing himself before
commencing, and did ditto after finishing.
Result: The landlady gave up her own room to
us, and we slept the sleep of the just, guarded by
several saints and martyrs.

It takes a long time for an influential
criminal to reach the tomb in the U.S. Roland
Molineaux, the fashionable young man charged
with murder by poison, was first tried in
April 1899 but the case was hung up on a technic-
ality. He was tried again and sentenced to death
in Feb. 1900, but he appealed and applied for a
new trial. Now he is to be re-tried. He will
probably keep on being tried till he finds a jury
to acquit him.
At Melbourne, recently, an old-age pen-
sioner, who was run-in as “drunk and incapable,”
was found to be so “ extensively populated ” that
even the hardened bobbies stood aghast, and the
ancient was promptly sealed-up for the night. On
Monday, when the court opened, he was placed
in the most obscure corner of the yard, while
inside the court the sergeant called out his name,
and then in a stage whisper to the Bench : “We
don’t want to bring him in, your Worships. He’s
alive in more senses than one! We want to get
rid of him as soon as possible.” “ Discharged ! ”
called out the chairman, with a shudder—and the
“inhabited” one was let loose again on the
Smelbourne public. A pensioner’s pensioners !

A STUDY IN TRUNKS.
A foreign gentleman visiting the Zoo is highly amused at
that macaw’s awful beak, while the macaw wonders how on
earth the elephant could have got loose.
Writes “Lid.” re “D.H.R.” (8., 15/6/ 01:
“ Buff” does say, about the effects of forest-growth on
climate, much which may be more or less true, but which
is also certainly more or less speculative. And for proof
that his theory doesn’t universally apply, note the long-
standing droughts obtaining over large tracts of the
dense pine-forests of western and south-western N.S.W.,
just a= is aiso the case over the treeless plains of same
latitude and altitude. As for springs drying up through
denudation of forest: in many parts of the State which
have been ringbarked for many years, and have had all
scrubby undergrowth cleared away, water from springs
is as plentiful as ever, and a verdure useful to man has
taken the place of the sour, useless stuff that preceded it.
Also the forest-land springs have dried up. Present
writer, nevertheless, is not an advocate of indiscriminate
ringbarking, but believes in an arrangement of shelter-
spots of umbrageous trees, not only in charity to stock,
but for the preservation and propagation of our more use-
ful trees, as a matter of national economy. The rough-
and-tumble system of our agricultural and grazing
methods, it may also be admitted, does not reveal to the
“man on the land” any better way to get a speedy
return for his labor than by killing all the trees in his
way as quickly as he can.

“D.H.R.” : In ’94, when I was working
on Buckinguy station, Marra Creek, the emus
simply swarmed on the run. Emu eggs at that
time were bringing a good price and the station-
hands did well. Myself and another man gathered
1700 eggs, and sold them at 14s. per dozen. One
man gathered 3000 eggs, and, altogether SOOO
were taken off the station. No work could be got
out of the blacks, who spent their whole time
hunting emus, and lived entirely on their eggs and
flesh. (

weighing nearly 401bs. —was
worked by a ‘'whip” and
horse under the control of a
man )who admitted at the
inquiry that he was not a
“ practical ” miner) and a
boy 14 years of age. The
immediate cause of the ac-
cident was the slipping of
the sprag out of the whip-
wheel and the inability of
the man and boy to check
the-“rush” of the bucket.
An almost similar accident
had occurred on two pre-
vious occasions.

wards. They, in turn, trans-
ferred to a syndicate, and it,
after six months of slump,
re-sold to another party,
which got a surface-patch of
a few pounds’ weight. Then
one of the original prospec-
tors bought the claim, and,
by drawing the slabs, has,
during his first month, got

[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
When the drivin’ haze is thickest and the grey begins to
show,
It’s whistle up the cattle-dogs and for the milkers go ;
And below the cultivation, seeking shelter under trees,
The starvin’ wretches shiver with their rumps against the
breeze.
It’s a miracle they’re livin’, though the end is very near,
For the Autumn months were droughty and the winter is
severe.
Every bone you think is tryin’ to get through the
shrivelled skin,
But it’s “ Heel ’em, Tiger ! heel ’em 1 ” and it’s rush the
beggars in.
Now they’re huddled in the stockyard, and it’s get ’em in
the bails
While the bloomin’ dogs are barkin’ and a-hangin’ to their
tails ;
And it’s milk ’em while they bellow at the stacks of
toothsome hay,
Intended for a market maybe twenty miles away.
Some have cancer, some consumption ; but it’s milk the
blessed lot,
For the cocky don’t believe in “ any bloomin’ tommy-
rot.”
He is creamery director, and to boss is near akin,
And his “ test ” is always highest, so it’s rush the beggars
in.
You curse the stupid bunglin’ and the want of judgment
that
Have made him stick a stockyard in a low and swampy
flat,
For when the cattle struggle and they agitate the sink
A sewer couldn’t beat it for a concentrated stink ;
And the slime gets in the bucket ’spite of all the care you
take,
And—you swear off milk and butter for your blessed
stomach’s sake ;
But it’s milk away and bear it with a curse or with a grin.
The cocky’s bloomin’ troubles ! So, it’s rush the beggars
in.
Oh ! the callousness of cockies, it will strike you very
hard
As you cultivate rheumatics and you paddle round the
yard ;
And the mornin’ sun’s a-glimmer now and then among
the haze,
Like a streak of comfort strayin’, or a s'gn of better
days.
But it’s fill the cans and cart ’em to the creamery away
(It’s quantity, not purity, that makes the milkin’ pay) ;
They are grimy on the outside and unspeakable within,
But it's waste of time to wash ’em, so it’s rush the
beggars in.

Australians are fond of yachting they have, therefore, the
seaman instinct, goes wide of the mark. Seamanship is
hard work, long hours, bad pay. Yachting is croquet on
water. About Sydney it is croquet plus a case or two of
assorted liquors... .G.G. : That’s true. The most flagrant
of turf swindles are, often as not, performed under the
patronage of the stewards of the meeting. The stewards
know when to expect a “startling reversal of form.” It
is somebody’s business to square them with early infor-

The First Trimmer.
(A Tale of the First Federal Parliament.)
TOLD IN 1920.
[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
lie wore a hat with a steeple crown,
And a sort of racecourse brim ;
We knew him well in those old years,
For he was the first to trim.
He was the first of the medium crush
To swallow the view of things,
That lifted him up with a luoky rush
Where commoners talk with kings.
Where two ways lead to a member’s seat,
And the sweets of a member’s screw,
The man-fox goes with unerring scent
For the easier route of the two.
To promise the thing that the people want
Brings the flesh pots fair to hand,
And members can easily change their minds
When inside they safely stand.
This was the plan of our vulpine friend t
In promises up to the chin,
And a steadfast resolve to forget the lot,
He waded and waddled in !
We’ve buried a myriad Fatmen since,
Much grease lias been melted down,
And some in the struggles of those old years
Have earned an immortal crown.
But the only crown that our member knew,
Who was first of the push to trim,
Was the steeple crown that so graceful grew
From the wonderful racecourse brim.
A SORROWING CONSTTTUENT.
An old-age pensioner in a N.S. Wales
S.W. district, a cripple, cannot draw his allow-
ance because he is compelled to go 35 miles to the
nearest bank for each month’s instalment.
An interesting sidelight on a recent
cablegram :
Cabled that more irregular troops are being raised in
Capetown, and S.M. Herald infers that, as the men are
signing-on for three months only, the military authorities
consider that the conflict is nearing its end. Well, to
this scribe’s knowledge the three months’ stipulation has
been in evidence for over 12 months ; yet many who ex-
pected to serve for the short term only are still hard at it.
It mostly happens that, after a glorious jamboree, there
remain but two alternatives to the “ stony ” ex-trooper—
starvation or more service. And so he is “patriotic”
once more. By-the-wav, many of the “ indulgence-pas-
sengers ” left Sydney hop: ig to sneak off at Capetown
without joining a corps as per agreement. But it won’t
work. Many Americans came over on the horse-boats
with the same idea, but when still many miles from the
wharf the vessel was boarded by recruiting-officers, who
allotted the men to various corps there, and in case of
refusal they would not have been allowed to land. And
after the arrival of every horse-boat there is an announce-
ment in the Capetown patriotic press something to this
effect:—“The Stars and Stripes” (big black heading).
‘ As a further indication of the cordial relations existing
between England and America it is noteworthy that all
the men who came over from Boston with horses in the
steamer Delusion, which arrived yesterday, have shown
themselves eager to help the British against the recal-
citrant Boer. They left for the front last night. Such
incidents as these are a sufficient answer to the frenzied
frothings of those who assert that Americans sympathise
with the dirty Transvaaler.”
When tlie shipping interest of Melbourne
has half a day off it mostly puts it in cursing that
eminent British engineer, Sir John Coode, and,
incidenta'ly, the Melbourne Harbor Trust. Years
ago, when the city woke up to the fact that its
Yarra was a failure, it was proposed to cut a new
Yarra from the city to Port Melbourne. The dis-
tance was only about 1| mile ; the State
owned the land, so there would have been
no compensation to pay ; the new river would
have been as straight as an arrow, and there would
liave been only lj mile of channel to keep in
order. But engineer Coode persuaded the Trust
instead to dig a channel a mile loi g which only
cut off a single bend of the old Yarra. It cost
about £lOO,OOO more than the price at which the
straight channel was tendered for. It makes Mel-
bourne 4| miles from the sea by a serpentine river
instead of about mile by a bee-line capal, so
there is all that extra river to keep dredged.
The only asset it created was a low-lying and evil-
smelling island. Apparently, nothing save the
natural incapacity of the Harbor Trust could have
induced it to reject the short and cheap route,
especially as it was recommended by the greatest
of living engineers in that line. Melbourne will
have to make the direct channel some day, and
lease out the Coode Canal, which cost over half-a-
million, to somebody to keep eels in. And, as a
side-issue, the next rich Yiotorian who wants to
buy a title while he is alive, or to make a name
for himself when he is dead, might put up the
money for the new channel instead of endowing
another piano-battering department at the Uni-
versity.

POLITICAL
POINTS
Government supporters are talking of a
pending change in the personnel of the N.S.W
Cabinet.
As usual, the one man one vote (or two
babies two votes) so long promised by Philp and
co. sinks surely out of sight. Six weeks ago it
was second on the Parliamentary Orders for the
day, now it is ninth.
Strange that so many mining labor members
have a leaning to Freetrade. Would the miner who
wants cheap German and Chow and Jap com-
mit 1 ? 3 growl if the artisans asked for cheap
minerals mmed by Coolies, or Japanese, or some
other 4|d a day pick-wielder?
i • P res ident Carey, looking forlorn and
chickless, attended Reid’s demonstration in
Sydney Town Hall, and left early with C.H.R.
Sydney D.T. just now affords the touching spec-
tacle of an ordinary kind of pup which, after hav-
ing cleared out,” is trying to get back to its old
master.
A “ Women’s Progressive Association ”
has been formed in Sydney, to talk back to the
tossil Leg. Council and generally shake things up
11 the women running the new show want the
Iranehise they had better stick to the old organ-
isation ; if they only want a chance to get on the
stump it is, of course, different.
As The Bulletin predicted two issues
ago, Queensland Labor representatives decided to
u l - nk^7 l i l} '/ re . etradis . ll views and support Barton on
, 1S policy. The passage of the
tariff through the Senate will be facilitated by a
similar attitude on the part of the Labor senators.

Softgoods Sargood moves in the Senate to
amend the Immigration Restriction Bill so that
any Indian employer may annually import five or
less prohibited persons to assist him in religious
observances or other duties, all such prohibited
immigrants to be returned inside five years (if
they can then be found). Sargood’s solicitude for
the Hindu’s soul is a touching circumstance.
But it’s a queer sorb of religion that wants five
parsons to every member of its congregation.
The Jenkins Govt, after almost endless
talk, succeeded in carrying the second reading of
its Parliamentary Reform Bill in S.A. Assem-
bly. Curiously enough, Darling, who is prac-
tically Tory leader, at the last moment allied
himself with the Laborists in opposing the
measure. Most politicians secretly pray for the
defeat of the Bill, but they pledged themselves to
reform at last election, and are now wondering
how they can manage to follow Darling’s example
without turning too sharp a corner.
Ewing, of N.S.W., in the House of Repre-
sentatives :
Some of the statistics quoted have not been very clear
One member took two hours to prove that a 'bus-horse
lived longer under Freetrade than under Protection.
The disingenuous statement that Queens-
land Govt, employs no Chinese in its postal ser-
vice, but that the Federal Govt, employs fifteen,
is just what might be expected from Attorney-
General Rutledge. The Federal Govt, is anti-
alien, nevertheless, and the Q. Govt, is pro-alien ;
but the former cannot all in one jump purify the
Piebald Regions.
The S.M. Herald wept for Sydney’s
sweated tailoresses, but it thought their time for
demanding increased wages sadly inopportune.
It comes, unfortunately, when the tariff has
already sent up the price of garments, and, by
still further increasing the cost of clothing, will
weigh heavily on our poor.” The most brutal
economic doctrine is morally on a higher plane
than such snuffle busting Pecksniffism.
Rumors in Melbourne still persist that
Kingston’s personality is too strong for a subordi-
nate to make the Federal Cabinet a really happy
famdy- Even Bigjohn Forrest is more amenable
than he. So that when Kingston jocularly inter-
jected to Bruce Smith “You don’t understand
the rule of three,” the retort courteous from the
Opposition benches, “ And you don’t understand
the rule of one,” made the House smile audibly.
N.S.W. possesses two police-superinten-
dents aged, respectively, 72 and 69. They can’t
be retired because they are entitled to pen-
sions, and the Police Superannuation Fund is
insolvent—owing to the exigencies of Freetrade
finance. N.S. W., alas! which is eternally
boasting of her riches, has more bankrupt
State funds, and dishonors and repudiates more
governmental agreements than any other of the
States.
Daily Express (London Jingo— but
Jingoism sings a different tune in 1901—paper)
prints from its S’African correspondent as late as
Sept, last re the war:—
What would they say in England to-day if the censor
would allow the truth to be told that again the enemy
are on both coast lines, and some of them within 40 miles,
as the crow flies, of Capetown ; that the port of Mossel
Ray is under the guns of warships, and that not even the
intelligence Department know how many Colonial rebels
have taken up arms during the past fortnight. . . . The
capture of the loyal delegates on their return to their
homes in Oudtshoorn from welcoming the Duke of
Cornwell at Capetown—a fact which we in this country
now know for the first time—points to the activity of the
commandoes in places least expected.
Wanted, in Australia, a Government dyna-
mite monopoly. A big Federal manufactory of
high explosives would fit in with any scheme for
national defence; it would also provide the mining
industry with cheap and good dynamite, and yield
a large addition to the revenue.
Treasurer Turner will find
the figures concerning this
matter well worth
turning over.
The most urgently-wanted standing order
in the Federal Parliament is one enacting that a
motion of censure shall be, limited to one speech
by the mover, one reply from the Government
and a vote—the whole thing to end in one night’
When George Reid was Leader of an Opposition
before, fully half the time of Parliament and
i u? a </ ear ln members’ salaries, besides much
valuable Speaker and gas-bill, were spent over his
futile motions of censure. Australia doesn’t want
a repetition of that experience.

a sickly plant, and must be sheltered against
too much light. But why should Barton, in

of suppressing so vitally important a dooument ’

The English Protectionist Movement—A Demand from
Nottingham.
“ Mr. Stiebel, a leading business man, moved : That the
time has arrived when the fiscal policy of this country ought to
be based on motives of expediency, and no longer on a rigid ad-
• herence to the so-called principles of Freetrade. He showed, as
other advocates of change had done, that the conditions of Eng-
lish trade have radically altered since 1860 ; that the so-called
! principles ’ of Freetrade were based on theories, not facts ; that
m the past prosperity had come to Great Britain not through
open ports, but rather in spite of them, being founded on the
unique geographical position of the country. It was high time
that England should say that it would not be bound by obsolete
theories. The attitude of the Morning Post is a typical instance.
Says this old-established advocate of Cohdenism and vested in-
terests : ‘We have certainly lost the industrial advantage over
other nations which we possessed when Freetrade was inaugur-
ated. In respect of machinery, and our position as the chief
market for raw material, and the banking centre of the world
we are losing ground. The Protectionist nations, so far from
being extinguished, are making up on us daily. Their exoorts
are increasing in a greater ratio than ours, even to our' own
colonies. Our shipping returns, which almost seemed unap-
proachable, are actually going down.’ ”
The newN.S.W. Municipalities Bill, which
Pfemier See says he means to push through this
session, proposes one interesting change in the
law—simultaneous election of the whole of the
members of every municipal council every two
years. This is the English County Council plan,
successfully adopted in order to wake the people
to more interest in the elections. The system
hitherto has been based on the retirement of a
third of the aldermen every year, and the “elec-
tions ” have been just about as great a farce as the
Vic. Council elections are, and for much the same
reasons. Both Sidney Webb and Ben Tillett, of
London County Council, urged this reform when
here.
The Westralian Worker (whose motto
is “Tell the Boys to Pull Together”) came out,
after the manner of many other papers, with a
bitter complaint that the Federal tariff was higher
than the old State tariff, and asked if Australia
would put up with this grinding tyranny, &c.
The attitude of the average paper—-even the
purely revenue-tariff paper—on this matter is a
curious proof of the average person’s want of logic.
The Federal Government is expected to provide
the States with about as much revenue as they had
before. It is also expected to abolish all duties
on nearly half the imports—the inter-State im-
ports. It is abused for levying heavy duties on
foreign imports to make up the loss. And if it
didn’t make up the loss it would be cursed from
Hades to breakfast and back again.
Concerning the debate in N.S.W. As-
sembly on the John Norton attack upon its
“dignity ” :
It was, on the whole, a most undignified exhibition
The lamentable weakness of Mr. McCourt as Speaker was
never more apparent than when he allowed Norton to take
Up .i it bulk ofhis “apology” with an attack on Crick,
and the latter subsequently to cry out every possible
accusation of infamy against the member on trial, and
at the time, absent by wish of the House. There is hardly
a prominent member of the N.S.W. Assembly whom J.N
has not, at one time or another, savagely attacked, and
his curses came home to roost during the debate with a
vengeance. The speech of J. H'. Carruthers was the one
really dignified and worthy feature of a squalid incident.
To Carruthers John Norton has been something’ more
than cruel, but the ex-Minister allowed not a word of
abuse to escape him, repudiated the notion that Norton
should be expelled, and urged the House to vindicate
its reputation “in such a way as to show no
malice ; indeed, to temper justice with mercy, though to
a man-who had never shoived mercy to others." The last
phrase, uttered with a fierce bitterness, was the only
revelation of the repressed feeling beneath a speech
strictly judicial in tone, and reasonable in sentiment
Carruthers never spoke better, probably will never speak
as well again. The rest of the debate was mostly low
comedy. One remarkable flower of speech by Mr. Dan
O Connor brought forth an indignant protest from Mr.
Andy Kelly, who claimed that the words used were “too
low to repeat.” But Mr. O’Connor repeated them, urged
their harmlessness, and claimed that they represented as
foine a payee of English as had been uttered there that
noight. Mr. Kelly accepted the assurance. Finally, the
House decided to accept an apology and a withdrawal
from the member for Nothumberland.
Westralian Parliament is credited
by one optimistic newspaper with a
determination to compel the Midland
Railway Co. to fulfill its obligations.
But is there in Australian history a
single instance of a private la,nd-grant
railway co. fulfilling its obligations?
Midland Railway Co. contracted to
carry passengers at the rate of 20 miles
an hour, and it certainly does keep
ahead of the average cow—unless the
cow is in an unusual hurry. It en-
gaged to settle 5000 Europeans be-
tween Walkaway and Midland Junc-
tion, and has absolutely ignored this
stipulation. In addition, the public
complains of overcrowding and lack of
lavatory accommodation on the trains,
and general conditions suggesting a
railway in darkest Africa, run on
darkest African principles.
There’s a golden opportunity for
someone to baulk the flood of George
Reid’s eloquence by asking him to ex-
plain what are “natural” industries,
and wherein do they differ from “arti-
ficial ” industries ? The Dry-Dog party
seems under the impression that it is
a natural industry to tear ground up
with a machine called a plough, but it
is an artificial industry to make the
plough to do it with. It is really as
artificial a proceeding to tear up the ,
ground with a plough and other
machinery as it is to tear up wool and
cotton in a factory and put them toge-
ther again with other machines.
George Reid is himself an artificial
product, and anything but a natural
one. He was born with the artificial
aid of a doctor and nurse; he was pre-
vented from growing up a stalwart,
healthy savage with few clothes and
several wives by an artificial system
of education ; and now, instead of get-
ting his “ tucker” in a natural way by
chasing animals and tearing them with
his teeth, he eats off an artificial plate,
with artificial adjuncts, all sorts of
artificial foods, or foods that have been
made palatable to his jaded appetite
by all manner of artificial means. In
fact, there are only about three or four
absolutely natural industries in exist-
ence, and they are never mentioned
in polite society. The “ natural indus-
tries” of N.S.W. that the Dry Dog-
man enthuses over are just as artificial
as those which he snarls at.
“ F.” writes an interesting piece
of Australian political history :
Hughes, M.H.R. for West Sydney, has so far contri-
buted the best speech in support of Reid’s motion of
censure, and the two eminent humorists are popularly
supposed to be friends again. Yet it was Hughes more
than any other man who spoiled G. H. Reid’s chance of
the Federal Premiership, by a bit of masterly politics.
When the Neild-grant vote of censure was being dis-
cussed in N.S.W. Assembly the Labor party eaueussed,
and by the usual majority of one decided to support
Reid and vote against Lyne’s motion. Thereupon
Hughes and (I think) three other Labor members, of
whom Holman and Griffith were two, collogued. They
were entirely sick of Reid and all his works, but were
bound by the caucus oath to vote with the majority tor
him, and thus save his political life. They decided to.
resign their seats on the ground that their pledge-
did not allow them to vote against Reid, and
their consciences forbade them to approve of the Neild
vote. The four resignations would have left Reid in a
minority of one, even though he got the balance of the
Labor vote. Tne result would have been a dissolution.
The four resigned Labor members would go to the country
on a platform of conscientiousness and first-grade
political honesty ; the rest of the party would be forced
to appear before the electors as apologists for a “ job.”
So soon as the true inwardness of the situation dawned on
the Labor party it hurriedly held another caucus, reversed
its previous decision, and Lyne came into office with a
thumping majority. As a bit of political strategy the
manoeuvre of those honest four deserves an imperishable-
record.
“ The policy which has made Britain para-
mount among the nations,” says N.S.W. ex-
Minister Carruthers, “is the policy of the open,
door.” Yes, opening the other fellow’s door—
with a jemmy.
The Freetrade party should do its best,
when the tariff gets into committee, to see that
Chinese eggs enter Australia free. Eggs will then
be dirt-cheap, and Dirt-cheapness is the Freetrade-
god. When trade in the preserved Chow egg
(which is just as good as the preserved Australian
egg of which people eat so many during one season
of the year) gets into proper working order, it can
easily be retailed at, say, sd. per dozen all the year-
round, and will then knock into the insolvency
court all the countless strugglers who are now-
pulling the devil by the tail on little Australian,
poultry-farms. However sad their case may be,
these poultry-farmers must go, in the interests of;
economic truth. It is better that the community
as a whole should have dirt-cheap eggs than that.-
any section of the people should have their par-
ticular industry coddled-up by Protection, and'
thus be led to act the part of vampires on the
body politic. The Bulletin hopes to see George
Reid and the Argus and the Sydney Daily
Telegraph die in the last Freetrade ditch on,,
behalf of the Chow egg. Then we shall have dirt-
cheap omelettes.

To Mr. S. A. PALMER.
Dear Sir,- It is with very (treat pleasure I testify to the
inestimable value of WEBBER’S Great Herbal Remedy,.
VITADATIO.
In 1888 I had a severe attack of gall stones and con-
gestion of the liver, which confined me to my bed for
some time. The doctor who attended me said I never
would be thoroughly cured ; but I used to feel quite well
between the attacks, which recurred very often—some-
times two attacks in one week. In the year 1892 I was
very ill with my long-standing trouble, and had another
medical man, and he told me that gall stones could only
be cured by operation, which I would not consent to. In
February, 1897, I received a letter from Dunedin, New
Zealand, telling me of the wonderful cures VITADATIO
had effected there, and urging me to take a course of this
medicine. As soon as I knew VITADATIO was obtain-
able in the colony, acting upon the advice of my sister, I
obtained six large-sized bottles of the remedy, and am
happy to inform you—and, in fact, the world for the
matter of that—l have been free from pain ever since,
and am now in perfect health.

FEDERAL TARIFF PRICES.
The proprietors of Warner’s Safe Cure beg to
announce that, as they have a branch laboratory
n Australia, Warner’s Safe Remedies will not be
subject to the duty of 25 per cent., which will
have to be paid on all proprietary medicines
imported into Australia.
The wholesale prices of Warner’s Safe Remedies
have been slightly advanced in New South Wales
so as to make prices uniform throughout Australia,
but this advance is so small that it will not be
necessary for the public to pay more than two
pence per bottle over and above the prices paid
before the Federal tariff came into force.
Warner’s Safe Cure is the only leme ly known
to science which will unfailingly cure all diseases
of the kidneys and liver. The following diseases
are cured by Warner’s Safe Cure, because they all
all arise from the retention in the system of
urinary and biliary poisons which it is the province
of the kidneys and liver to expel: Rheumatism,
indigestion, gout, neuralgia, biliousness, lumbago,
sick-headache, backache, sciatica, gravel, jaundice,

Mr. C. W. WALKER. Mias IDA MAY.
“ Mr. Walker is the founder of Walker’s Merry Makers, Goats and Walker’s Minstrels, and is
credited with being the first to introduce cake walking in Cincinnati, 0. He also is an adept
with the guitar, banjo, and piano. Mr. Walker was the shining light with Wilson and Stewart’s
Minstrels, and has always evoked considerable attention wherever he has appeared. He has
always proved to be a gentleman as well as a performer.
“As for a dancer, Mr. Walker has few rivals for style and execution ; he easily carried the
honors and won the medal, whicli Manager Clark offered for artistic terpsichore.”— Kansas City
Times. ,
“In ‘On the Mississippi,’ there is Chas. W. Walker, who essayed the role of Andrew
Jackson Brown, and was the the redeeming feature of the dancers.”— Washington Post.
“Mr. Chas. W. Walker, of ‘The South Before the War ’ Co., was the claverest character of
its kind ever seen here. Very seldom you see a colored man give a correct description of himself ;
lie is really funny in his natural state, but when upon the stage he most generally over does it, so
Mr. Walker is surely deserving of some credit.”— New York Sun.
“ The cast was excellent in many respects and the colored element was given an opportunity in
buck and wing dances, and also in five speaking characters. One of these was Charles Walker,
who essayed the role of Andrew Jackson Brown. Mr. Walker was given an ovation and the
splendid portrayal of a servant’s character merited it.
“ I have known Walker since his boyhood and always thought he would get there. Well he has
dona so, for he is the hit of the show, one of the hottest boys I ever saw, and a gentleman withal.”

LETTERS and TELEGRAMS ADDRESSED to “THE
MANAGER” wiP RECEIVE PROMPT ATTENTION.
“H.S.R.”: Just been reading about
Rhodes at his grouse-moor in Scotland, and
Chamberlain spouting about Democracy at Blen-
heim, whilst drinking Marlborough’s champagne,
and somehow I can’t get Zola’s words out of my
mind. How sad to think that the most guilty
should always escape punishment, and air their
impunity in the sunlight, whilst thousands of
innocents lie rotting in the ground !
Though the JN.S.W. importers’ gang made
all reasonable haste to get together a meeting for
cursing purposes, yet almost the first, if not the
first, tariff gathering in N.S.W. was highly
friendly to the proposed duties. It was a collecting
together of Illawarra farmers for the purpose of
starting a big condensed-milk industry. The
pastoral State of N.S.W., supposed to be one of
the great cow-raising countries of the world, has
hitherto, under its miserable Freetrade system,
depended helplessly on the crowded European
c-ow for its tinned milk, which is a tolerably
ridiculous situation. Last year £BB,OOO of good
Cornstalk money, which was badly needed to pay
wages locally (enough to pay £3 a week to 560
men and maintain their 560 families) went away
to Europe for this one item, and the loss is in-
creasing yearly. All the blatant howling of the
English and Gei’man importers of Sydney about
commercial freedom doesn’t amount to a row of
pins by comparison with this one fact. It is
wages this country wants —wages, victuals, a
regular job, enough sordid cash to enable it to
marry its best girl and support the kids. And it
can’t get that by importing.
Piebald Premier Philp to a select Bris-
bane audience re the Kanaka Bill:
j n Queensland they knew something about the sugar
industry, but the Federal Government, without inquiry,
and without thecourtesy of asking the Queensland Govern-
meat for advice, rushed forward and brought in the most
drastic legislation ever directed against State On
behalf of the State Government he appealed to the people
to resist as much as possible any interference with the
sugar industry until full inquiry' into the industry had
been made.
They do know something about the sugar industry
i n Queensland, and that was doubtless why
Queensland sent such a solid anti-Kanaka and
anti-colored-labor contingent to the Federal Par-
liament. And why should the Ministry consult
the Queensland Government, any more than the
Queensland Government consults the Gogango
Divisional Board ? It consulted the Queensland
people, and their answer was definite enough,

-I-I l ® wail of the small huckster and the
frosted Freetrade Torv, who for years has dilated
on the beauties of a “ free breakfast table,” is loud
j n Maoriland just now. “Trusts and combines ”
have been springing up lately. Millers have
pooled their businesses, demolished their scat-
tered mills, and erected one substantial structure
w ith modern machinery to supply a whole dis-
trict, and also to export it's surplus. Storekeepers
have done ditto, and thesfilall huckster whosebusi-

“New Tory ” party, mostly composed of the men
on the land, support the movement. The organ-
j S ed workers, busily preparing for a great fight
f G r supremacy with the New Toryism, say no-
thing. They realise that there are still too many
middlemen, and that the average huckster spends
one-fourth of his time selling goods— i.e., distri-
buting—and the other three-fourths is ocoupied in
removing the goods from one shelf to another and
wiping the dust off them. Also, they believe
that the better organisation of the means of pro-
duction and distribution will make easier the way

POWDER.
It was Plato who said, “To educate the mind and neglect the body is to produce a
cripple.” Be careful not to cripple the action of the Stomach, Liver, Kidneys, and
Bowels by neglecting the periodical cleansing of the human machinery, which is so
necessary at this season of the year.
nature’s grand pick-(I)e-Up F r ®®
TAKEN IMMEDIATELY ON RISING IN THE MORNING a dessertspoonful of Kutnow’s Powder
in fresh-drawn spring water will be found delightfully refreshing. A cup of hot tea fifteen minutes later will
hasten its beneficial action. During spring-time two or three doses a week will so regulate the system (by
cleansing it of all impurities and by expelling the excessive Uric Acid) as to absolutely ensure a continuance of
good health and thereby prolong the span of life. HEADACHE, BILIOUSNESS, INDIGESTION, CON-
STIPATION, and KIDNEY DISORDERS cannot stand against the marvellous beneficial action of Kutnow’s
Powder. It is the most gentle of all aperients, no pain can possibly ensue, not even in the case of the most
delicate invalid. Griping is unknown, the laxative effect is perfect, and, unlike ordinary salines or salts,
Kutnow’s Powder possesses distinctly medicinal properties, which eliminate all poisonous and putrifying
deposits in the system, and at the same time invigorates and restores the organs to healthy activity, thereby
rejuvenating enervated nature.
Honest Testimony to Merit.
The Medical Journal (April, 1901) says:
AS A SUBSTITUTE for the European medicinal spring treat-
ment, many eminent medical men and the most prominent medical
journals have recommended KUTNOW’S improved effervescent
POWDER, as the same is a portable, economical, reliable, and very
agreeable remedy, extensively employed by the profession, to whose
further attention it is recommended. It exercises a beneficial effect
on the liver, gall-bladder, kidneys, and stomach. The flavour is
refreshing, and it is readily taken by women and children. It has also
been successfully prescribed in diabetes, and for the correction of the
lithic and uric acid diathesis, with or without jaundice, constipation,
acid dyspepsia, and hemorrhoids. “ Its advantages,” says a medical cor-
respondent, “ appear to rise from its possessing the power to eliminate
from the body the excess of bile and acids, thereby purifying the blood
and strengthening the general tone by improving the assimilative pro-
cesses of the debilitated system. Consequently, it has a salutary effect
in cases of hypochondriasis associated with low spirits and general
depression.”
For the above reasons KUTNOW’S effervescent Carlsbad POW-
DER has been employed, under the highest medical authorities, for
patients leading sedentary lives, and those suffering from abnormal
accumulations of fat. For corpulent women, in particular, physicians
will find it a pleasant remedy when aided by the appropriate diet. The
well-to-do classes, with leisure to command, periodically seek the
cleansing and health-restoring medicinal spas of the Continent. Of the
millions of sufferers, however, only comparatively very few are favored
by such fortunate circumstances as to enable them to indulge in the
luxury of a trip to the Continent. Therefore, as a boon to suffering
humanity, Kutnow’s effervescent Powder won by sheer sterling merit
the approval of such authorities as Sir Spencer Wells, M.D., Professor
Lawson Tait, M.D., Sir Morrell Mackenzie, M.D., Sir Andrew Clark,
M.D., and the most eminent physicians everywhere.
CONSTIPATION.
“To educate the mind and neglect the body is
to produce a cripple.” The neglect of constipa-
tion until it practically becomes habitual, is
responsible for most of the ills which flesh is heir
to. It is the foundation of disease by the storing
of foetid putrifying matter. It renders the man,
woman, or child a predisposed subject for the ac-
ceptance of typhoid and all contagious disease.
Constipation is no respecter of persons, everyone
is liable to the blocking-up of the natural sewer of
the body. The insidious trouble accumulates
quietly a storehouse of blood poison, the first
warning note of which is given by the exudation
on the skin of the hateful pimple, the painful boil,
or the more serious carbuncle. At this season of
the year (spring-time) you meet people who dis-
play a mass of skin eruptions, the evidence of un-
clean blood. The victim might think there is
something wrong with the air or that the weather
has broken its record. He has sick-headache, loss
of appetite, a foetid breath, a foul tongue, rest dis-
turbed, nightmare, fidgety, irritable, palpitation,
and bladder troubles. What is the remedy ?
.KUTNOW’S POWDER, and the way to be abso-
lutely convinced of its sterling merit is to send to
the nearest chemist for a trial bottle.
KUTNOW’S POWDER can be obtained in
capsuled bottles any chemist or medicine
vendor. Insist on Kutnow’s, and see that you get
it. Any suggested substitute is absolutely worth-
less.
CONVINCING TESTIMONY.
“ Addingham Vicarage, Langwathby, R. 5.0., Cumberland.
“I am much obliged for the sample of your powder. 1 have already
tried it, procuring it locally from my chemist. I consider it an excel-
lent remedy in all troubles connected with the Liver, etc. It has the
great advantage of being pleasant to take.
“(Rev.) T. W. STEPHENSON (Vicar).”
“Berry Head Cottage, Brixham, Devonshire.
“I consider I have now given your powder a fair trial, and beg to
say I consider it the most agreeable, and at the same time distinctly
the most efficient, aperient I have ever used. “W. MUNRO.” '
“ Whitecliffe, Monks Risboro’, Tring.
“I beg to thank you for the sample bottle of your Carlsbad
Powder. I have been suffering from the effects of a sluggish liver, and
I have derived great benefit from the short course of the powder, night
and morning. I have ordered a bottle from the local chemist.
“(Rev.) J. F. STEPHENSON”
“ 8, St. Catherine's Road, Perth.
“ I have derived so much benefit from the use of your Carlsbad
Powder that I shall never be without it. I feel as if I had got a new
lease of life. I cannot speak too highly of it, and shall certainly do all
in my power to make known the value of Kutnow’s Powder.
“ MARGARET BRUCES.”
“22. Lewis Crescent, Brighton.
“ Nurse COLLEY thanks Messrs. Kutnow for the sample and has
found it excellent. She will be pleased to recommend it whenever she
can.”

“ Many thanks for sample of your Effervescent Powder. I have
found it a great boon, and shall certainly continue its use during the
summer. “J. H. BRYANT.”
“14, Wellington Road, Old Charlton.
“The few times I have taken your Powder proved its worth
already. For the future I shall not like to be without it in the house.
It not only acts rapidly, but produces a feeling of brightness after.

words to say about Dr.
Morse’s Indian Root Pills.
He writes : —“ Owing to
irregular hours of work
and irregular meals, to which I was subjected, I
have suffered for the past two years from sluggish
liver. On arising in the morning I would feel
more tired and stiff than when I went to bed
at night, I was advised to take Dr. Morse’s
Indian Root Pills, but was loth to do so, as I had
no faith in those sort of things. But at last I
decided to give them a trial, and after taking a
few doses, was so astonished to find the good
effect produced that I continued taking them;
and now I am pleased to say that I feel as well as
ever I did. You have my full permission to use this
statement, as it may be the means of others obtain-
ing benefit from these wonderful pills.” Dr. Morse’s
Indian Root Pills are a perfect blood purifier

Revenue paralysed Melbourne Cup betting and
took away a deal from the interest usually attracted
thereto. Twos were snapped up eagerly everywhere, and
’tis said Oxy refused to lay £lOOO to £5OO in one hand.
Many good ’uns have come from Revenue’s family, but
’twould be hard to think of another able to go the full
Oup journey at top speed. Titan, the top-notcher of the
lot probably, one time gathered in a two mile w.f.a.
event run for speed, yet he couldn’t be called a stayer.

The good thing, the strong tip that the
betting market gave, and The Bulletin printed in
prose and verse, and the dogs in the street barked,
has won the Melb. Cup. Most turf scribes
wouldn’t have him because he wasn’t seasoned ;
they hadn’t seem him perform for 12 months
Three years ago handicapper Dakin rated Revenue
equal to the best two-year olds of his time, and these in-
cluded Chesney, Partheon and Reviver. Since then we’ve
seen Revenue do nothing, yet that astute follower of the
turf, Mr. McDonald, felt justified in paying out 725 guineas
for him (a gelding) at the St. Alban’s sale. At the same
time this same clever gentleman became possessed of
Wakeful, Aurous, Regained, and Kinglike : all of which
have appropriated races since. That Mr. McDonald
“ knew something ” (and he was in a posi-
tion to know a great deal) is evidenced by
Revenue’s triumph, and the fact that the Trenton
gelding depleted Mo.’s bank account to the extent of,
perhaps, £25,000 for the stable alone. Most of the public
held off the good thing because of the absence of public
form ; the market tip wasn’t good enough for them,
and yet, in the big majority of cases, it is the best,
especially when coining from such a quarter. Last year
money went on Revenue plentifully, but he didn’t finish
among the first dozen. Later, at the same meeting, his
people singled him out as good goods for the Pinal
Handicap, but he never got a drum.

Seven starters only for V.R.C. Derby, yet the
win-tie-or-wrangle system of jockeyship resulted in a
protest against the winner for “ interference.” And, as
showing that there was considerable force in the protest,
the V.R.C. stewards didn’t terminate the scandal by
giving the race to the first horse until there had been an
adjournment of the inquiry. The evidence of their own
eyesight was not conclusive. Undoubtedly Grasspan was
interfered with. One moment the Grafton colt seemed
to be winning—that was just below the distance
post—and the next moment Hautvillers had a
commanding lead, whilst Grasspan and one or
two others appeared to have got into sudden
disorder. A few seconds later Grasspan was rapidly
overhauling the favorite, who got home by a bare half-
length. As to whether the interference was a decided
breach of racing law, or only an ordinary consequence of
simple “ besting ” tactics, the public in general had no
opinion. Present scribe would say that the compara-
tively veteran Bobby Lewis outjockeyed the boy Kuhn.
Anyway, he timed his run to a nicety, and won a verdict
which, for the credit of the turf, the stewards were
naturally indisposed to upset.
• • * •
The Derby time—2sec. faster than previous
record —takes some further discount off the value of the
time test in judging “ form.” If the clock were an infal-
lible guide to merit, Hautvillers, the winner of two excep-
tionally fast Derbies, would rank as the best of a smart
lot of 3-year-olds, whereas nothing could be more certain
in racing than the comparative poorness of the youngsters
this season.
• • * •
V.R.C. Derby gossip: Hautvillers’ time (2.37)
is the speediest yet set up. Previous best (2.39) was
shared in by Martini. Henry in ’B3, Trident in ’B6, and
Carnage in ’93. Hautvillers traversed his first 4 furlongs
in 52£, the second in 51J, and the last in 53J. He looked
so light, trainer Scobie didn’t fancy his chance, and put
all his friends off with a fatal conscientiousness. Owner
Bailey, also depressed by Scobie’s view, proposed Haut-
villers should be withdrawn from all V.R.C. engagements,
but Scobie only struck out the Melbourne Cup. It was
all public money that made him the favorite, the stable
only benefitting to the extent of a few bets taken weeks
ago at short odds which could not be unloaded. Haut-
villers was bred by Sam Hordern at Wilton Park(N.S.W.),
by Haut Brion (imp.) from Narrara, by Goldsbrough
from Ethel, by Yattendon. Bought by owner Bailey for
430 gs. as a yearling, he scored in V.T.C. Alma and Ascot
Vale Stakes as a two-year old. At recent A.J.C. Spring
meet he won the Derby and Craven Plate and finished
among the “ other starters ” in San Fran’s Metrop. It is
seven years since a protest was lodged against the winner
of a V.R.C. Derby, when Malachite objected to Harvester
wearing the ribbon on the ground of interference. As
with Hautvillers, the protest was dism.ssed.
• * • »
The protest against Hautvillers recalls to mind
the scrimmage by which Aurum doubtless lost the Derby
that Amberite won in ’97. That year the field was
limited to 6, and the interference with the favorite hap-
pened before the horses came to the turn for home ; but
it was such serious interference that little Aurum needed
to be to pull himself together and struggle into
third place. On the subsequent days of the V.R.O. meet-
ing he defeated Amberite over three different courses,
7 furlongs, 9 furlongs, and 2 miles. So much for “ good
things,” even when there are only five jockeys interested
in spoiling the g. t.

The Maribymong Plate went to an outsider, in
Niphetos, rather than to a filly with an outside chance.
On her Debutant Stakes running at Caulfield, three
weeks earlier, Niphetos ought to have been about first
favorite for the two-year-old Derby. The Deb. Stakes
race was not accurately reported by the daily papers.
Niphetos had some palpable bad luck in that half-mile
scramble, but she came fast at the finish, and was only
beaten by a head by Brakpan. Everybody happened to
be watching Brakpan and Heloise at Caulfield,
because they were popular fancies. Nobody noticed
Niphetos, the 15 to 1 chance, from a small stable. The
market for the Maribymong Plate was very much as the
Caulfield betting had been. The public rushed Brakpan and
Heloise, and hardly gave a thought to Niphetos. She won
this time in brilliant style. Perhaps the price would have
been shorter than 10 to one if the followers of Bradfield’s
stable had not been staggered at the easy defeat of
Patronus in the Maiden Plate. They had reckoned on
backing Niphetos with their Patronus winnings, and
when the colt got badly beaten they lost their confidence
as well as their “ stuff.”
* *. • •
Niphetos, winner of gilded Maribymong Plate
on Saturday, is a rare beauty, by Bill of Portland from
Tea Rose, by Martini Henry from Lily Hawthorn (imp.),
by Knight of the Crescent. She is full sister to Scorn,
which annexed the same race in ’9B. Bred by the late
Mr. W. R. Wilson, she passed to Mr. W. Clark (S.A.) for
240 gs. Second nag, Farewell, was also bred at St. Alban’s,
and, as a yearling, went to Mr. J. E. Brewer for 190 gs.
She is full sister to Barragunda and half-sister to Wallace,
by Bill of Portland from Melodious by Goldsbrough.
Third, Great Scot, was bred at Widden, and, when a
yearling, brought 200 gs. He is by Lochiel from Scotch
Mary by Clan Stuart. The time(l.2J) for the race (5 fur.)
is top-notch speed, and has only been twice beaten—by
lolanthe in ’B3 and Arihi in ’94. The field (embracing
five Cornstalks, one South Australian and four Victorians)
was small. Of 31 Maribymong Plates run only two (those
in ’7l and ’95) attracted fewer starters.

Judging at V.R.C. Spring meeting opened
groggily. For Coburg Stakes Fusilette was placed second
and Miltiades third. Subsequently Beanba was made
second, Fusilette third, and Miltiades relegated to the
stragglers behind. Again the customary practice of
placing four nags in Maribymong Plate and Derby was
overlooked, but, fortunately, there were no weight
shortages or disqualifications.
One of Rupert Clarke’s horses—Paul Pry—
was deprived of third prize in the Moonee Valley Cup by
the error of the judge who placed Gauleon in front of
him. But at Flemington last Saturday, S’Rupert got
back 25 of the 40 sovs. he -lost at Moonee through another
judicial error whereby Miltiades was placed third in the
Coburg Stakes. As a matter of fact, Miltiades didn’t
finish in the first six.

Projectile’s get were well to the fore on Satur-
day. Niphetos and Ballyragon won at Flemington, and
Loveshot at Warwiok Farm (Sydney).

Best thing at opening of, V.R.C. Spring gather-
ing was the dash from the barrier to the post in the
Encourage Stakes of Bally ragan. Though backed from 10
to one down to five to two Owner Brewer had only £25
on the horse he paid 105 guineas for as a yearling. Bally
was bred by J. and W. Thompson at Widden, N.S.W.,
from Gymkhana by' Projectile, by Emulation from
Gaiety, by Talk of the Hills.

The decadence of betting : Punter and Mo alike
bewail the passing of heavy wagering on Melbourne Cup.
Phil Glenister (father of Sydney “ Tatts.”), who engineered
the Revenue commission, also put the money on Wakeful
for the Caulfield Cup, but couldn’t get more than £4OOO
in Melbourne and Sydney before offers fell below 100’s
to 6. This year’s betting is the poorest for the last
quarter century. In ’9O, Mr. Wallace got £30,000 about
Carbine, some of it at 20’s. Presumably, the nag was
backed to win £60,000. all-told, whereas 20,000 or 25,000
sovs. would skin the market now. Sydney bookmaker
Oxenham tells that, in Carbine’s year, his transactions
totalled £40,000, but he didn’t drop a thousand of his
own. He laid £43,000 against Malvolio, when he won the
Cup in ’9l, but £46,000 came along to pay it with.
This season, he has done less than half the busi-
ness. Glenister says the cause is too much subur-
ban racing, and the increase in the number of
operating Moes. Oxenham ascribes it to calling
the card, and the consequent forced competition among
layers, besides which money is scarce and backers few'.
Constant racing of Cup horses exposes their strength and
probabilities, and causes the withdrawal of inferior cattle.
All of which is amusing. Wild horses won’t draw Moes into
competition at the calling of the card, which is frequently
run through without a blow. It is absence of competition
among the Ikeys that has killed the game, and the objec-
tion of the public to take all the risks. Mo. never opens
his mouth wider than will keep his satchel secure ; and
the people are tired of it; consequently, the big backer
has vanished. Assertion re exposed form didn’t fit the
nag that paralysed this year’s business, nor any one of a
few of those before him.
• * • *
Tuesday’s Melbourne Cup field equalled the
smallest recorded since 1887, when Dunlop left 17 others
behind him. Quality of this year’s runners, as a whole,
compares poorly with those of previous years.

“Old’Un.” Didn’t take much stock in turf
scribes’ contention that because Revenue hadn’t run in
public for twelve months his prospects must be
discounted, albeit Arsenal (16 years ago) was the only one
who succeeded under like conditions. Training work
has been good enough for many first-class winners
of events over shorter distances, then why not 2 miles ? In
’77 Chester just pipped the favorite (Savanaka)prepared as
and where Revenue was, and alleged authorities attributed
the Kingston-Sappho colt’s failure to want of a public run
or two. Savanaka was fit enough, as were Lapdog, Romula,
Arsenal and Nada when they went to the post, though
their preparation was of something the same nature.
Don Juan and Gaulus only had one race each before they
scored. Some nags undoubtedly need plenty work with
the colors up, but there are others who don’t require it
at ail.

A stout and prominent Sydney citizen who, on a
recent visit to Adelaide, accompanied a leading A.R.O.
official to the races, gloats over the following experience.
A pound sweep was proposed on a race with 22 starters,
and he was deputed to hold the coin. After the drawing,
being a stranger, he mooned round- on a general in-
spection. One of the sweep-subscribers with a reputation
as a runner quietly followed him, and, accosting a friend
of the adipose one, indicated him thus : “ I say, you see
that fat cove sneaking ’bout through the crowd over
there ? I fancy he’s looking for a quick way out, and as
he’s got 21 quid of our money I’m goin’ to watch him."

All good advocates of the tote who know the
facts of a certain Victorian embezzlement case must hope
that the accused will make a full confession of his foolish-
ness. The bezzled coin was lost on the turf, the wagers
being of sufficient magnitude to “ stop the horse ” in some
cases. Betting on credit with Ikey Mo was the main
cause of the trouble that befell poor Juggins. The
temptation to do business “ on the nod ” came, in the
first place, from Ike, the Israelite. It would not have
come from a machine that doesn’t talk. The tote silently
discourages “ plunging.” It has checked embezzlement
in S.A., on the showing of the Police Dept. The same
Juggins Who “ did in his stuff or, rather, the “ stuff "
which wasn’t his—with his friend, Mr. Mo, of Melbourne,
would doubtless have been a less dishonest J. had his
billet been situated in Adelaide, where the tote is. He
was very possibly ruined through not having the tote to-
play with. The Government of bis country denied him
the gambler’s means of salvation. O, think of that, dear
friends, and li t your petitions against the tote be changed'
into petitions for the tote.

English cricketers reached Adelaide, Monday.
Maclaren talked : Australians would need the best form
he had seen here to win. His side was a “ bit weak” in
bowling, which, in England, was below the standard of a
few years ago, but no better bowlers than came with him
were left behind. In refutation of assertions that the
team was not representative, it included seven who played
against the last Australian side. If they shaped up to
’Ome form they’d prove themselves the finest fielding
lot that ever visited Australia. Jessop is a brilliant bat
and an extraordinary hitter. Tyldesley has an attractive
style. Garnett’s crisp and wristy left-handed work would
recall W. Bruce’s methods. Last English Eleven lacked
and wanted what present combination has, a punishing
bat like Jessop, a stonewaller of Quaife’s quality, and a
good variety of bowlers.
* * * •
S. A. team to meet the Englishmen presents no
novel features, except for the loss of Darling and Lyons. The
12th man was still a college boy a year ago, but the 11
are the same old stagers. G. Giffen and Jones are both
in better physical condition than usuaL McKenzie this
time beat Jarvis in their annual tussle for the place
behind the stumps.
* • • *
The Bulletin’s Londdn correspondent upon the
Maclaren cricketing co. “It would be prudent for the
Cricketwealth “ down under ” not to value too cheaply
Maclaren and his five amateurs and eight pros., for it
would not surprise me if they leave Australia the finest
team that ever left England. They are certainly in bat-
ting the toughest lot of joints that could be got together
here, though there is not a brilliant bat amongst them—
Jessop will be found delightfully vigorous. Consistency,
stubbornness, grimmness and determination will be
found their assets, and if Australian bowlers have hearts
to break they had better tie them with green-hide before-
hand. It is a team of run-getters—look at them :
In the just - concluded season’s averages W. G.
Quaife and Tyldesley came sixth and seventh to top (Fry
78'67) with 56 and 55 odd runs respectively. Hayward
50'70, McGahey 48'36, A. O. Jones 46’77, Jessop (the sure-
eyed slogger) 4075, Wicket-keeper Lilley 39-03, J. Gunn
(nephew of the famous Billy Gunn) 36'53, Braund 36-06,
H. G. Garnett 35 - 87, Maclaren 31 ”44, and reserve-stumper
C. Robson (Hampshire’s captain) 1575.
“ On paper just now the bowling looks slightly anaemic.
For the season Tom Hayward came 9th in the general
list with 30 wickets for 20-43 apiece ; Blythe, of Kent, 93
or 23-12 ; J. Gunn, the Notts ‘ pro.’ with the Richardson
pace and action, 92 for 23'41; Jones, 56 for 27*62;
McGahey, 52 for 28'50 ; and Braund, 120 for 30’62. Barnes,
a fast bowler, is practically a ‘ junior,’ and has taken
only 6 wickets in county cricket, but has performed
splendidly for Burnley, the Lancashire League winners.
He took 120 wickets for 8 runs each, and Maclaren has
a great and cocksure opinion of his (B’s) abilities.”
• * * *
“On at least two occasions this season,” writes
The Bulletin’s London correspondent, “Maclaren’s* pecu-
liar behavior ’ has caused the crowd—an English crowd,
remember—to cat-call and hoot him. It would have been
far better had he fallen into line with Lord Hawke ; then
Pry and Ranji, Hirst and Rhodes might have been your
opponents. Touching upon one of the Maclarenisms re-
ferred to, the Mornino Post said : ‘To act as Mr. Mac-
laren acted on Saturday is to run counter to the very
spirit of the game. It is not sport, and —to put it on a
much lower level —it is not policy. Let us hope, for the
reputation of English cricket, that Mr. Maclaren will play
no more of these fantastic tricks, particularly while he is
in charge of his team in Australia this winter.’ ”
* * * *
All previous English Elevens coming to Aus-
tralia have been absurdly over-rated in the “ advance
notices.” Maclaren’s team, which has now reached
Australia, will probably prove that they are now
being underrated. Among their various bowlers
who are new to Australian wickets, one, or two, or
three may develop a little talent for adapting their
trundie to the foreign conditions, which is more than
could have been expected of any of the old mechanical
pros, who topped the list of averages in England last
season. There are at least some possible surprises in the
Maclaren crowd as regards bowling. On the other hand,
the general estimate of their batting capabilities, founded
on English figures, is very likely to be discounted when
they are put to the Australian test. Ranji, of yore, was
a disappointment. The young amateurs, Druce and
Mason, were utter failures, and Wainwright, who was
going to be one of the batting “ scars ” of Stoddart’s
Eleven, gave scarcely a suggestion of his alleged smart-
ness.
* » • »
Ages of Maclaren’s team: Hayward, 30;
Cjuaife, 29 ; Gunn, 25 ; Jones, 28 ; M’Gahey, 30 ; Lilley,
34 ; Braund, 25 ; Jessop, 27 ; Maclaren, 30 ; Robson, 30 ;
Tyldesley, 28. Ages of Blythe, Barnes, and Garnett not
ascertainable. In comparison with its predecessors,
Maclaren’s team is comparatively youthful.
* * * *
from London to The Bulletin: Mac-
laren’s team includes four county captains, i.e., A. Mac-
laren, Lancashire; A. O. Jones, Nottinghamshire ; G. L.
Jessop, Gloucestershire; and O. Robson, Hampshire.
Excepting that the first has visited Australia, it would
be better for the tour’s placidity had any of the last
three been skipper.

The decision of N.S.W. Cricket Association to
revert to a sole selector for inter-state teams is the result

for Y ” business.

For the “bye” in Sydney electoral first-grade
cricket the odd team is pitted against what is called the
“ Trustees’ team ” —a collection of players financed by
the Sydney Cricket Ground Trustees. N.S.W. Cricket
Association professes to see in this “ Trustees’ ” team an
attempt on the part of the S.C.G. people to ape the
powerful M.C.O. of Victoria, and, by acquiring control
over a large number of players, to assume absolute con-
trol of N.S.W. cricket. The Vic. Cricket Association is
small potatoes alongside the imperious M. 0.0., and the
Sydney Cricket Ground is credited with a desire to
emulate the latter.

Sydney’s fourth round of senior cricket had a
faultless day on Saturday last, when North Sydney-Pad-
dington supplied the surprise. Previous week, in the
North Sydney-Sydney match, both sides scored freely to
an average of nearly 50 per wicket, but, on Saturday,
North Sydney made a very poor showing, comparatively,
notching only 95. Paddington did a little better with
112. At Waverley, five of the home wickets made 459
against Central Cumberland. Sydney had five wickets
down for 336, in opposition to Sydney Cricket Ground
team ; and Leichhardt-Balmain gathered 267 for Redfem
to have a cut at this (Saturday) afternoon.
• • * «
M. A. Noble grows effective with the
leather. He wrought the downfall of North Sydney,
Saturday last, when he bagged five for 45. For Padding-
ton against Burwood, recently, he secured seven for 49 ;
and, before that, he scattered five of Sydney’s wickets for
33 and six of Redfern’s for 41. This probably means a
heap in face of the threatened dearth of first-grade
bowlers and the advent of the English team. North
Sydney man Clarke promises big things later : four. of
Sydney’s wickets, last Saturday, fell to him for 41.
* • * *
Consider the sensational batting of Charlie
Gregory this season. Against Central Cumberland, on
Saturday, he hit up 207, not out, for Waverley. In four
innings he has scored 57,150,109, and 207 not out, 623 in
aIL On Saturday he remained at the wickets all the
afternoon.

youngster went for the runs, and hit them off without a

In a house bulging with humanity, and an
atmosphere thick enough to cut, for over 20mins. on
Saturday night at Sydney Golden Gate A. 0., Mat Mitchie,
of Broken Hill, made savage attacks on Pyrmont pug.
Frost. Mitchie had the ferocity, the brawn and the
thew ; Frost had the grit and the skill. Mitchie hurled
himself on to his opponent, and seemed about to over-
whelm him by sheer weight of meat, when the skilfully-
launched left jab, and stubborn front stayed the cj-clone
and gave the reeling Frost respite. The man from Broken
Hill began to wear an anxious expression, and after a
fierce rally, the police stopped the fight, which referee
M‘Donald declared a draw.

Australian in lustries for the benefit of them and
their kind. And if there is any sense of grati-

Reid has toiled hard to keep the Austra-

on this account. But this woman’s husband was
naturalised later, and why should not this
naturalisation extend to his wife? The Vic.
Government seems to be anxious to prig pensions
on every possible pretext. It is a loathsomely

“ Haresfoofc ” : George .Coppin is almost as old as the
Melbourne stage. The first dramatic performance ever
given in Melbourne happened Monday*2lst Feb., 1842, at
a place then called the Theatre Royal, Bourke-street, near
the Bull and Mouth, the plays being “The Widow’s
Victim” and “Lottery Ticket.” There is a record of
another performance at the same shanty, 24th Aug. 1842.
The Queen’s Theatre, owned by J. T. Smith, opened
Monday, 21st April, 1845, under the management
of Nesbitt, who was seemingly. Melbourne’s first
actor manager: Coppin, leaving England in Noy.
1842, reached Sydney in March, 1843, and promptly
established himself as a popular Comedian. When
aforesaid Queeri’s Opened, Coppin, who just then
was Kinnirig* the Launceston (Tp-s.) Theatre, brought oypr
his co. 9-nd orchestra, ahd His Melb. a6but at thfc
Queen’s on Saturday, 21st June, 1845, with “Lady of
Lyons.” Cast : Claude Melriotte, C. Young ; Beauseant,
Thompson j Claris, Coppin ; Qamas, Rogers ; M. DeS-
chapelles; Watsoh ; Pauline, Mrs: Coppin. This brilliant
actress had been the widow of Watkins Burroughs, a
Dublin manager. Thompson was the father of -Mrs. G;
Young (afterwards Mrs. Hermann Vezin) who only
appeared as a dancer in the opening programme.
“ Vet.”: George Coppin’s farewells were extended
over half a century, and his positively last appearances on
any stage whatever have been spread over about 30
years. Here’s something about one of old George’s bona-
fide first appearances in Melbourne.' “ The School for
Scandal” was first produced in Port Phillip at the
Queen’s Theatre, Melbourne (now a furniture-store), on
July 3, 1846, when the characters were sustained by
“ Coppin’s Launceston Company.” Here was the cast of
“The School for Scandal” (the Bill is before the
I Writer): —Lady Teazle, Mrs. Coppin: Mrs. Candour,
Mrs. Rogers ;' Maria) Mrs. Young ; Lady Sneer Well, Mrs.
Humbleton ; Sir Peter Teazle, Mr. Coppin J Charles
Surface) Mr. Young; Joseph Surface, Mr. Thomp-
son ; Sir Oliver Surface, Mi*i Borers ; Moses,-Mr,
Gpie; Crabtree) Mr. Humbleton \ Sir Benjamin Back:
bite, ML Itav ; Trip, Mr. Wilks ; ROwley, Mr. Watson ;
Snake, Mr. Tur.neh. Everybody in the east given above is
dead; ekcept Cdppiti Himself, and;perhaps, Mrs. Charles
Ydung; This deponent iii npt able to state the present
cdnditiori or whereabouts df that oboe faVoiite Melbourne
actress. Not iiiany years agd; she flourished oh the Lofiddh
stage as Mrs. Herman Vezin.
“Methuselah” writes:—“Re your par. about W. H.
Williams, of Melbourne, the evergreen printer and singer.
Forty years ago some playbills, sent to me in England,
bore’the Initials, ‘ W.H.W.’ in two places. It was among
the performers, and again it appeared as that of the
printer at the foot of the bill. At that time he belonged
to the A.B.C. (Amateur Benevolent Comedians) and
Garrick clubs. Another member of the clubs was Cr.
‘ Billy ’ levers, who died in ’95, and when his coffin was
taken to St. George's R.O. Church, at Carlton (Melb.),
old stage-chum Williams Was a leading member of the
choir that sang his dirge. Editor Winter, of Melb.
HmraLD, served his time as a oonip, under Williams at a
I little printing-office near the G.P.O. The office of the
, Hawklbt (Which delectable organ is published by W.H.W.)
stands on the site of the Queen’s Theatre, where ‘Mel-
bourne’s oldest printer’ sang in the.. Fifties. I have
known the veteran personally for 35 years, and during that
time I have noticed very little change in his appearance
, of his tetior voice. *’
At eminent English author-aefcor-manager has written
I a new drama, entitled “ The Creation.” The distinguished
author-playwright Will, of course, play the part of the
Almighty himself.
“ JiA.C.” : Re the late Mrs. W. S. Lyster (“ Woman’s
Letter,” B; 26 10/’Ol). Her nanle Was not “ Georgina,”
but “Georgia,” after the U.S.A. State in which she was
bdrn.
ft“ T;D,” : Australian male sirlgets dan’t Help feeling
fenvious at the way these glorious Contraltos and sopranos
work the public. There’s a tegular string of them off
’Ome—Alice Hollander, Hetty ItrtlroVd, Nellie Cook, and
more.to follow. Melbourne girls of the Castles brand get
bebefits before ever they have sung in public, but the poor
tenor or basso has to pursue t he elusive guinea for years,
and nobody ever talks of taking him up for a boom.
When the masculine Australian does manage to get away
for further study, he is generally too old to do any good.

Aii old story, but good. The electric-light

“ Right-Angle ” : Be the damages lately

phorised pollard laid on a travelling-stock route
The drovers have now established a precedent which
may have serious results to the pastoralist, who is com-
pelled by the Rabbit Act to keep down bunny ; yet he is
penalised because the sheep of the insolent drover
prefer poison to the luxurious grass that his (the
Squatter’S) flock Have eaten out of sight Weeks previously 1
By-the-way; a fcomnioii sqUattet’s dodge for moving-on

Arthur Nicholls, Vic. Parliairierikry poet,
had promised the Ministerial a rilost
delightful outing amongst the fern-gullies bf
Noojee and Fumina in the Neerim district, the'
home of big trees and the rain and mud fiends.
What Cherapoonjee is to India in the way of rain,
Neerim is to Australia. Less than 11 inches of
rain on end is reckoned droughty at Neerim.
Tracks had been cut, marquees erected, and a
glorious time was anticipated in the inspection of
the Flor de Habana and whisky plants growing
luxuriantly in the shady fern-gullies, but rain
came in torrents just when it was most needed (by
the party) elsewhere. The stock of mackintoshes,
leggings, and umbrellas at the local store was
bought up at famine prices. The party was much
impressed With the Water-supply, and recognised
that there is ft vast difference between water and
Whisky atid Whisky and water, and the poetical

“Englishman ” to The Bulletin
T. P. O’Connor, editor of M.A.P., possesses more' thaii
a genius for discovering that every notable Protestant
person of recent decease was either an actual R.C. ill
secret or a partial R;0. at heart. The persistent Tay Pay
seems to have also discovered that the Anglican Church
gets all its dignified clergy from the land of O’Connor.
Prattling re the fate of the Empress Frederick, he said :
“ When her last hour was coming she waved all the high-
titled and ribboned and medalled Teutonic Court chap-
lains away. It was an Irishman, who is an English canon,
who heard her last words of faith and hope ; it was
another Irishman, who is an English bishop, who, by her
express command, read the prayers over her remains.”
O’Connor’s journalism is amusing to any cynic who
chooses to call himself an Englishman, especially a cynic
who notes the fact that Irish members of the House of
Commons declare themselves and all Irishmen to be anti-
English and “rebels to the core.” On the one hand we
have the assertion that no true Irishman is in the least
degree English ; and, on the other hand, we have the T.
P. O’Connor sort of patriot swearing that each English-
man as he comes to the front is an Irishman. If he isn’t
Irish by name, then he is Irish by blood, or vice versa.
The hero is invariably Irish somehow —if they want him.
But if they don’t Want him, why, then, his birthplace
goes for nothing. You don’t find them enthusiastically
claiming Kitchener for one or themselves ; ai d yet it is
Open to any professing Englishman to suggest that the
brutality of Kitchener is to his having drawn
his first breath of life in an Irish atmosphere, which,
according to Irish Nationalist agitators, is full of hate
germs. Take the Nationalist shrieker at his werd, and
what a breedingqfiace of evil passions must Ireland be 1
But we don’t take the professional “ rebel ” at his word.
We prefer to think that the genuine amiable Irish kink
is in the brain of the Tay Pay O’Connors.

RAMEY’S MEDICATOR.
A great pioportion of all Australians have Catarrh in either the first stage or
chronic form. Probably 20 per cent, of all the people we meet have but one good
nostril—the other is clogged with catarrhal deposits, or by some weakness whose
parent was a neglected cold. This forces them, perhaps unconsciously, to breathe
through the mouth, and, unless attended to, will result in a life-long annoyance
and serious trouble. Home treatment with our Medicator will restore the organ
i n^ tural con( Jition, and enable it to perform its functions properly and
healthfully. It relieves and cures Catarrh, Hay Fever, Cold in the Head, and all
isas.il inflammations. It soothes, cleanses, heals; contains no injurious drugs

PHYSICIAN and SURGEON.
HAYING had 30 years experience in all parts of the
world, and also having lately made an extended trip
through Europe and America, he is in a position to
treat every case submitted to him according to the
methods of the most recent and eminent Specialists.
Every Case treated on its own Merits>
Sufferers at a distance, unable to describe their cases to
their own satisfaction, should write for Dr. Watson’s
“ Guide to Diagnosis A,”
which will enable them to give exact and full particulars, so as
to enable him to report fully as to the disease and its radical
and rational method of treatment.
Consultation Free
(Personally ,
or by Letter).
The publication of crowds of symptoms, testimonials and
puffs of one’s skill and attainments savours too much of self-
praise ; so the public should look with a doubtful eye upon all
those who “doth protest too much.”
Dr. Watson does not pretend to say that “ One Pound is
sufficient to send ,” as stated in certain advertisements, for he
considers that the public are quite satisfied to pay a fair price
for fair legitimate treatment.

San Francisco is raving—its newspapers are raving
anyhow—over Miss Hilda Spong. Thus the Argonaut re
her performance of the part of Mrs. Bulmer in Sydney
Carton’s latest:—“Miss Hilda Spong paints the fitting
mate to this portrait. Tall, elegant, exquisitely attrac-
tive in her smiling ease, equipped to the finger-tips with
the alluring graces of the queen of society, full of a fas-
cinating suggestion of unsounded depths, with a play of
feature and a trained grace of pose and gesture that hold
the eye enchained, with a charm of voice and variety and
expressiveness of tone that make the ear hunger for
more, she richly fulfils the dramatist’s idea of the woman
Who, in a half-hour’s chat, charms the heart out of the
hitherto contained breast of the middle-aged bachelor.”
■the efforts of the Monowai’s passengers to amuse them-
selves and divert their minds from the awful possibilities
during the long days when the lamed and helpless
steamer was knocking about the Pacific led to many
extempore flights of comedy, the most absurd and success-
ful of which was a glove contest to a finish between Max
Eugene, Musgrove’s baritone, the largest man on board,
and Ruhr, the jolly little fellow who blows his soul
through the French horn in the orchestra. The battle
raged furiously through innumerable rounds, and resulted
in a knock-out, Ruhr swinging his right toe on to the
boss corn of Eugene’s left foot. The baritone was counted-
out, and Ruhr was then invested with the ship’s cham-
pion belt, and took the last cake in the Monowai’s larder.
The funniest thing in Fitzgeralds’ Circus show is the
interchange of foreign language between Adelina Antonia
(a Roumanian by birth) and a swarthy gentleman who
acts as master of the ceremonies during her “ turn.”
When Adelina is ready to make her sensational back-fall
from a high trapeze into the net below, the M.C. gravely
asks her in German if she is quite ready, and the lady,
Who can nowadays talk Australian like a native, replies
with a French “ Oui,” after which she somersaults to her
destination, and the band plavs.
“ Skull": Was delighted with the way in which an
excited rabble was represented by three supers in a
recent imposing silver-coin suburban show. The stage
Was rather larger tharl a family dining-table, and the
three rushed on with much yabber and excited gesticula-
tion, and mixed themselves up to represent the infuriated
populace with such spirit as to convince the audience
there was really a vast concourse “ Mafficking ” on the
boards. The illusion was smartly assisted by the fact
that each man represented two or more persons, masks
and false beards being hung on to various elevations of
the head, so that the performer was one individual from
the front and a total stranger to himself at the rear. I
have never known a serious situation to excite such
cordial and long-sustained laughter. Two dummies,
evidently borrowed from the barber over the way, lent
material assistance in this scene.
A while ago, when the long season of Chinese “ opera”
was about to be inaugurated in Melbourne, a consignment
of Chinese orchestral goods came to hand, and among
them were some gigantic cymbals. Celestial music con- I
sists largely of cymbal-banging, and the Chows claimed in
all sincerity that these circular sheets of metal should
come in duty-free as musical instruments, like the tom-
toms, one-string fiddles, and other weird orchestral
furnishings. But the Customs, after much banging and
clanging of the articles in dispute, decided that they
were gongs— suitable for summoning folks to dinner—and
charged 20 per cent, duty on them. All things con-
sidered, the Chows in their country have good reasons to
massacre the arrogant white man as a “foreign devil"
when they get the chance.
A proposed “ pirate” performance of “What Happened
to Jones” was gallantly frustrated at Maryborough (Q.), i
by the local bill-poster, who refused to post the pirate’s
printing, and threatened to paste over any put up. So
the piratical agent had to leave town without doing any
business, and Charles Arnold rejoiced when he came to
Maryborough and played to an overflowing audience.
Mr. Arnold rewarded the bill-poster for protecting his
rights, and will acknowledge future instances of strenuous
honesty in the same way.
The British peerage has been strengthened by another
Pier of the stage, the Earl of Clonmell having married
Miss Rachel Estelle Berridge, a provincial panto, star.
During a recent production of “ Mikado ” by theN.S.W.
Railway-Tramway Society, at which the Railway Com-
missioners were present, Roko included them in the list
of witnesses to the execution, which is supposed to have
taken place as ordered by the Mikado, thus completely
spoiling the joke—the real point being merely the recital
of the various offices held by Pooh-Bah, intended, as he
says in another place, to “ give an air of verisimilitude to
an otherwise bald and unconvincing narrative.” Pro-
bably it was similar experiences by Gilbert at the hands
of undiscriminative mummers which caused him so
vigorously to veto “ gagging ” in any of his operas.
Wilson Barrett’s physical energy and capacity for head-
work are the admiration of his supporters, anyhow.
Young George Majeroni speaks of the veteran as a won-
derful stage-manager and patient “ coach.” In rehearsing
his new play, “ The Christian Ring,” he went through
every part, line for line, with every member of the co.
If they didn’t take kindly to his suggestions he gave
reasons for his reading of the text, and there was always
something to be learned from the vigilant man of business
who is himself always on the look-out for new points.
Wilson Barrett, in fact, seems to be more of a hero to his
own servants than he appears to the people in front
after they have taken the measure of his mannerisms.
The actors respect him greatly for t h • .work he puts into
his shows, most of which is out. ide of the part he plays
on the stage.
The late Martin Simonsen’s luckless importation of the
Spanish Students is recalled to mind by some recent
appearances of a Melbourne “ Mandolin Club.” The
mandolin, as poor old Simonsen learned to his cost, has
no power to move an Australian audience. The Students
of yore twanged many mandolins with excellent musical
precision, but their ping-pong melodies fetched only the
mildest applause, and finalty the house lost all patience.
Signor Vadala, who is running the new mandolin class,
doesn’t aspire to give a dozen “ turns” in a night, as the
Spanish Students did. Eight or 10 lady members of the
club perform a couple of concerted pieces ; also there is a
solo by the gay Signor, and a trio in which he shares the
twangs with Mrs. Cunningham and Miss Lambert; a
number of songs and weird variety items helping to
make up a programme. Three mandolins at a time
seems to be as much as anyone wants. A hundred of
them twanged in unison would be a wasteful expenditure
of time.
Honest and genial Louis Lohr, most tactful of theatrica
agents, having compiled enough dollars for a decent
start, means to settle down as a boniface—probably at
some pleasant waterside spot in Victoria.
Basil means sheepskin in a tanned state, and it is a
current trade word among saddlers. _ So Basil Gill, who
plays the despondent young lover in some of Wilson
Barrett's dramas, is known behind the scenes as Leather
Gills. A man can’t be too careful in choosing his stage-
name.
A Wesleyan parson, at Melb. Convention, objected to
the Pleasant Sunday Afternoons as being too lively, and
tending to demoralise the rising generation. The Bulle-
tin has hoard of a man who regarded the Dead March as
comic opera and an invention of Satan.
Looks as though Charles Arnold’s luck is likely to
remain with the co., when George Willoughby and Edwin
Geach take over the management next year. “ The
Wrong Mr. Wright,” with which the new Firm hopes, to
out-rival the “Jones” and “ Smith ” success, has been
making a lot of money for Lionel Rignold around
England, and is reckoned one of the strongest “ touring”
shows on the market. Arnold, who has sold “ Wright ”
outright to W. and G., continues to work the old reefs,
getting rich gold as before. In Queensland, the demand
for “Smith” and “Jones” has been great, despite the
heat.
The recent Melbourne revival of the “ Silver Ring ” re-
calls Bucklaw’s first night as Wilfred Denver, at Melb.
Royal, years ago. Something went wrong with the pistol
with which the Spider shoots G. Ware, so the Spider
promptly stabbed his victim instead, but .the old
servant who enters spoke the usual line, “I thought
I heard a shot.” Further on, when Bucklaw, as Denver,
had to discover the body of G. Ware and stagger back
against the table, the important piece of furniture cap-
sized and fell on top of him. Finally, as he was con-
cluding a really well-delivered recitation of the famous
dream, in the' last act, a voice of anguish from the
crowded gallery broke the appreciative silence with “ Oh,
you clumsy brute ! Get off my corns ! ” Altogether a
heart-breaking night for poor Bucklaw.
Harry Beaumont (Caesar Creegen in Woods-Williamson
version of “ The Manxman ” as played at Melb. Princess),
furnishes about the only instance on record of an actor
playing Cornelia-Carlyle in “East Lynne.” Beaumont
once played it without the local press discovering that
the part was filled by a man.
"J.A.C.”: Sydney musical critics, when referring to
somebody whose voice “wobbles,” have an irritating
habit of calling this defect “ the vibrato.” Now,
“vibrato” is not a noun, but an adjective, and, if used
in connection with “ voice,” .should, in any case, be in
the feminine—“vibrata.” Further, una voce vibrata, or
vibrante, means a vigorous voice—a voice throbbing with
power. “ Tremolo ”is what the “ critics ” aforesaid are
driving at. The French have a terse way of putting it:
“ II chevrote ” —(“ he bleats ! ’’)
An incident of the war. At Cradock, nine
girls, aged between 15 and 20, and one married
woman, were charged with harboring the King’s
enemies, and supplying them with food. Two
were discharged, but the others were sentenced to
30 days’ imprisonment.
A threatened strike of N.S. W. glass-bottle
makers suggests the utility of an Arbitration
Court. Each side to the dispute gives a different
version of the facts, and an independent judg-
ment would be welcomed by the pub.ic.
Efforts were lately made by relatives to
upset the will of an eocentric “ Hindoo hawker ”
named Phillip Lauterstein—good name for a
Hindoo ! —who left the bulk of his savings of £6OO
odd to Vic. Govt. “ for its kindness in allowing
him an annual license.” Justice Williams, in
granting probate, remarked that the family had
disowned him because he preferred busbman’s
garb to fine linen, “ but they didn’t want to dis-
own his money.” Lauterstein, by the way, was
born in Jerusalem.
Carruthers, M.L. A., at Ashfield, a wealthy
Sydney suburb, on Saturday evening:
To a man of the middle-class the tariff means a tax of
between £3O and £4O a year.
Does it really ? And what becomes of the lamenta-
tion of the Calico Jimmy party that it is a sinful
heaping of the public burdens on the shoulders of
the poor man, and a sacrifice of the down-trodden
worker for the benefit of the rich? The down-
trodden worker doesn’t live at Ashfield—so there
the Barton tariff is denounced as a sinful attempt
to make the well-to-do classes pay up.
London Undertakers’ Review, bemoan-
ing the slackness of trade, suggests that England
should follow American ghoulishness, and ship
from S’Africa for burial in England the corpses of
soldiers, “so that friends and relations could
consign them to their proper domestic tombs with
all becoming marks of sorrow.” Incidentally,
also, so that the undertakers should grow fat with
the other worms.
In 1810, in a letter to Marshal Massena,
the great Duke of Wellington set forth the mili-
tary law of defence :
What you call “ peasants without uniform ” and
“ assassins and highway robbers ” are the ordenanza of
the country, who are bodies of soldiers commanded by-
officers who are paid and are subject to military law. . .
It is a simple question of whether a country which is
invaded by a formidable enemy has the right to defend
itself by every means at its disposal. If this right exists,
Portugal is justified in putting into the field the orden-
anza, a corps recognised and organised by the ancient
laws of the country.
And Wellington went on employing Portuguese
and Spanish guerillas. But England never can i
recognise that what is sauce for another
people is sauce also for her. When Wellington
crossed the Pyrenees into France he stamped out
a guerilla movement by threats of wholesale hang-
ings. Now the Boers are styled bandits because
they defend themselves by the means at their dis-
posal. But, no doubt, it should be made a rule
of war that the enemy must fight on the lines of
the British autumn manoeuvres.

f)r. JAMES WILSON writes: “I have thoroughly examined and tested Hale’s
new Patent Electric Belt, and I am satisfield that not only is it a genuine article, but
it generates an electric current capable of ox ercoming the resistance of the body. I
consider it a valuable agent, especially for ladies and gentlemen of tender skin, as no
metal substances come in contact with the body, and I am only too pleased to recom-
mend a genuine electric appliance.”
“Dr. FOWLER presents his compliments to Messrs. Arthur Hale and Son, and
has much pleasure in stating that he has carefully examined their new improved
Electric Belt, and finds that it is perfectly genuine as to electric properties.”
Dr. DEWAR writes : “ I have examined Hale’s new Electric Belt, and find that
it is capable of generating a powerful electric current, although no metal substances
come in contact with the skin. I consider this a great improvement, as it prevents
the irritation so often caused by other appliances.”
PERCY NEWELL, L.R.C.S., L.R.0.P., writes: “There is no doubt about the
Electricity, as my patients constantly feel the current.”
“ THE MEDICAL MONTHLY,” August, 1893, says : “ The firm of Arthur Hale
and Son, of 105 Regent Street, London, W., has distinguished itself in the develop-
ment of electrical science as a medical agent. By an entirely new method of applica-
tion they have succeeded in producing an Electric Body Belt, which for comfort
efficacy, and genuineness, is unquestionably far superior to any previous invention.” ’

WHY WE ADVERTISE I Because Advertising is the legitimate means vouchsafed to enlighten people
f! 11l Bw a- «« s nwfc « to acquaint each other with their avocations and wants. If a man has a
Speciality, and has devoted years of his life and expended large sums of money in studying that Speciality and in
purchasing the necessary appliances, etc., for treating certain diseases, it would be absurd for him not to announce
the fact, and disseminate the knowledge universally, We have no apology to offer for informing the world through
this advertisement and otherwise of the means of relief we can afford to sufferers who need our help. Therefore
however opposed to your own preconceived ideas and to those of your medical advisers, our method of treatment
may be, the fact still remains that it is successful, and this is verified by the thousands of testimonials received from
grateful patients. We make no secret of our mode of practice. We only claim to have utilised in a common-sense
way the result of scientific research and long experience. If you listen to the counsel of your sceptical friends and
jealous physician you may omit consulting us, but remember if you allow the disease to run riot in your system vou
are guilty of culpable neglect, and are alone responsible for your future pitiful condition.

DO NOT BE DRUGGED TO DEATH BY QUACKS
When there are so many quacks and impudent pretenders in the field of Medicine, who arrogate to themselves

Item from S.M. Herald :
“Chemist” writes: —“Example of how the tariff
works. I purchased methylated spirits of wine before the
tariff was published at 2s. per gallon. An excise duty of
6d. per gallon has been put on, and now the price to me
is 3s. 6d. per gallon.”
Supposing that is true : excise is a purely revenue
duty, and the item goes to show that revenue
duties—the kind the Herald is always demand-
in <r are most disastrous. It also shows up the
trading community-of which the is th
favorite organ —as a conscienceless swindler.
Likewise, it reveals private enterprise as bea g
nearly synonymous with highway robbery, and is
calculated to make many people, who didn tfor
merly realise the utter villainy of the commercial
classes, begin to dre im of State Socialism.

WEAKNESS & GENERAL DEBILITY.
A Good Friend at the Right Time.
The Case of Mrs. J. DEVINE.
(BY A LOCAL REPORTER.)
Many households, scattered up and down
this State of ours, have one or more members
struggling against the most adverse
elements which beset mankind, and how
much mentil anguish’could be saved if such
facts as those given by Mrs. Jennie Devine,
of the Poultry M'art, Melbourne-street,
South Brisbane, were only tliougnt of at
the right moment? Whilst chatt ng to
our reporter the other day, Mrs. Devine
raid :—■
“When in the hotel business in Sydney
come years ago, I used to get such strange
turns that I often found it necessary to
leave the bar and go for a lie down. This
happened generally after eating a biscuit or
two, or something of that sort, and I was
deeply concern d about my health, because
mv stomach used to swell out so much with
wind that the pain was more than I could
bear, and I had to take my clothes off to
give myself a little ease. The pains were
just like the cramps, and while they lasted
I was rendered as helpless as a child, with a
nasty giddy sensation in my head as well,
and when the giddiness went away I was in
great distress with heavy aches across my
brow. I lost all my spirits, and when
customers came in they never found me in
the mood for a pleasant chat, as I was
always too low-spirited and depressed to
talk. ‘ What is the matter with you ? ’
t hey used to say. ‘ Really I do not know.
1 feel half dead,’l generally replied. And
so 1 did, for I had no vigour in my body,
and I felt fatigued before the mornings
were half over. I wished for bes time to
come, but when I retired I could not sleep,
excepting for an hour or so at intervals, and
when I got up next day my limbs were
aching for the want of rest.”
“ I gather from your remarks that your
liver was out of order,” said the scribe.
“So my doctors said ; but I was also
suffering from a severe form of nervous
complaint, as nearly every organ of my
body trembled, especially if I exerted my-
self in any way, and it became quite a
chronic habit for me to think about things
which frightened me—at night particularly.
I only ate when it was compulsory, the
taste in my mouth giving me quite a loath-
ing for my food ; but the lightest of eatables
gave me pains in the chest, and there was a
continual twitching under my shoulder
blades. My children were at a boarding
school in Parramatta, and on one occasion
when I had been visiting them I was taken
ill in the train. I fainted right away, and
'vhen I recovered my senses my fellow-
i,i.a,veilers said that I had gone perfectly
black in the face when the incident oc-
curred. The pains in my back and loins
were very bad, and I used to get so weak
that I have often had to keep to my bed for
two or three days. If I bent my head for-
ward a dizzy sensation came over me, and
everything became quite misty before my
eyes, which felt as if they were swollen. I
told you that I only slept for short periods,
but I was forgetting to mention that if the
sleep lasted for but half-an-hour it was
usually attended with the most dreadful
dreams, and when I awoke from them I
seemed so upset and frightened that for a
long while I could hardly realise whether
those hideous thoughts were real or only
imaginary. The shaking of my nerves in-
creased as my strength daily grew less, and
even my feeble appetite at length took its
departure altogether. When I looked at
my pinched face in the glass I used to
wonder, with awful misgivings, what was
going to become of me, for the impoverished
condition of my blood was shown in the
whiteness of my skin, and my body was so
thin and shrunken that my clothes were too
loose for me. Three weary years of torture
had reduced me to this dismal state of help-
lessness, and as I had been treated by
several of the best doctors during that time,
and felt no better for their physic, what
hope could I possibly have of ever getti g
my health back again? My only chance
rested on the medicines which I had seen
mentioned in the papers, I thought, and as
this belief was based on the failures of the
mixtures p escribed by my doctors, I
set about getting something from the
chemists.”
“ With abetter result, I hope?” inter-
polated the newspaper man.
“I regret to say that they were not all
beneficial to me, although 1 took plenty of
those advertised concoctions in fact, too
many, as I was getting more debilitated and
more m rvoits under the influence of those
vile drugs.”
“ Then how do you account for looking
so well now, Mrs. Devine?”
“ I will explain the mystery to you in the
same way that I have told others. It was
Clements Tome which released me from my
diseases, even after all the other so-called
remedies had no effect. For years I had
been wanting a good restorative and
curative me ticine, but I did not obtain it
until I had purchased a bottle of Clements
Tonic, a few doses of which gave me a
wonderful amount of relief from my suffer-
ings. The first proper night’s rest 1 had for
a long time was after taking Clements
Tonic, and the difference in my condition
next da was perfectly astonishing, for I
felt quite refreshed and lively, and wanted
something to eat. It was in this simple
manner that Clements Tonic carried me out
of danger, the swellings and stomach pains
drifting away by degrees till they were
completely out of existence, and the head-
aches and chest pains were likewise
effectively stopped. Each dose of Clements
Tonic improved my appetite, and as the as-
similation of my food was under the control
of that medicine, I had no trouble from in-
digestion after my meals were concluded.
The regular action of my internal organs,
following the use of Clements Tonic, had an
important bearing on the complete success
with which my ailments were overcome, for
the bitter taste left my mouth, and my
tongue lost all the fur which had cov> red it.
Thus I was set free from the sense of sick-
ness which had distressed me so much, and
my blood was enriched by the nourishment
I now took. My nerves got firmer and
steadier, till there was not a quiver in them,
and all the pains and aches about my body
went away and never again returned. My
clouded spirits became bright and cheerful,
because I was once again a healthy woman ;
and if you care to publish what I’ve said
you can do so in any way, as I have no
other medicinal friend in the world but
Clements Tonic.”

The Ways of Many Waters
By E. J. BRADY.


To British Columbia and back, with half-
a-million salmon ova, in something under eight
weeks, is an achievement that “ Sandy ” Morton,
of Hobart Museum, is justifiably proud of. He is
probably prouder of the fact that his beloved fish-
eggs reached these shores all alive and kicking—-
N.S.W. Commissioners finding in good order 80
per cent, of their share of the result of his
raid. Mr. Morton reports that his trip convinced
him of the truth of- the hitherto scouted Yankee
• yarn that the salmon were so thick in the rivers
over yonder that they could hardly pas 3 each
other without taking to the land. In the
Fraser River he actually saw the pheno-
menon —the river being all a-seethe with the fish
going up to spawn. Boat loads of splendid fish,
from 91b. to 151 b., could be bought at one
cent to five cents apiece. The Amurrikan boast
that in regard to fish, ‘* we eat all we can and can
all we can’t,” will hold water no longer; for this
year, at all events, the crop is so prolific that the
canneries can’t can half they can catch, and the
hatcheries and catcheries have so many salmon
they don’t know what to do. The “ sockeye ”is
the most valuable commercially, and as Tasmania
already has a good supply of the best sporting
varieties, Mr. Morton took care to secure the
former brand.

Zfa PIANOLA
** It is astonishing to see
this little device at work
executing the masterpieces
of pianoforte literature
with a dexterity, clearness,
and velocity which no
player, however great, can
approach Every one who
wishes to hear absolutely
faultless, free from, any
kind of nervousness, piano-
playing should buy a Pi-
anola. It is perfection *' —
I. J. Paderewski.
Has arrested the attention of the
musical world. Its claims have been
investigated and verified by the great
pianists themselves.
This verification of its claims makes them interesting and
worthy of attention.
[HE PIANOLA is an instrument by means of which any ent
can play the Piano.
This is accomplished by simply rolling the Pianola in
front of any piano, allowing the felt-covered fingers to rest
Upon the keys of the piano, then inserting a roll of perforated paper
into the sockets, and operating the pedals. Playing-directions appear
upon the roil as the music unwinds.
Thus the Pianola provides a substitute for the human fingers and
a correct technique for any piece. .
The artistic effects and vivifying personality are given to the rem
dition by the player, who controls the expression. It is entirely subject
to his will. He may vary the touch from the most delicate pianissimo
to the “ lion’s touch of Rubinstein.”
This human element is the distinctive feature of the Pianola, and
removes it from the ranks of purely mechanical musical instruments. It
taxes the credulity of all who . have not heard it, but is substantiated by
the fact that the Pianola
is the only Piano-Player
endorsed by musicians
of note.

J. C. Williamson to Date.
To interview Mr. J. 0. Williamson I had first to
see Mr. Goodman, who said to a clerk : “ Show
this gentleman the way to Mr. Williamson’s office
or he might get lost among all those girls.” The
girls were members of the Italian Opera Co. doing
morning rehearsal, and one of them broke the
hat-string she was tying as I entered the green-
room, with the result that her elbow fetched up
against iny chest with a strong back-kick. I
struggled through some scores of girls and their
ribbons, and hats, and frilled trains, and ruffles,
and roses, and finally got past their full-back, who
was sitting on the steps of the entrepreneur’s
office.
Mr. Williamson said: “I couldn’t begin to
remember how many parts I’ve played in, but
I’ve played every kind of character—old men,
young men, low-comedy parts, leading parts,
Shakespearean parts. I’ve played in every dialect —
Irish, German, French, Scotch, Somersetshire,
Lancashire, Italian, Chinese, Yankee, Negro.
I’ve been getting my living in this profession since
I was a boy of fifteen. My early theatrical edu-
cation was in the great school of its time —Wal-
laces theatre, New York. There I was amember of
a conipany that has never since been equalled (mind
you, Fm not saying that that was all my fault),
I continued at Wal lack’s theatre for seven years,
playing in old comedies, Shakespearean plays,
Robertson comedies, and all the better-class plays
of the time. Afterwards I played as star in every
city of prominence through America—East, West,
North, South. I also starred throughout England,
Ireland, Scotland, Australia, and India.
“ During my recent trip through England and
America, I saw that American acting has im-
proved more in the past eight years than English
acting has done ; but I saw nothing in the general
productions of either country to surprise me ;
nothing new or striking that we hadn’t done out
here. And I’d mention here that the Australian
{>ublic is better catered for than any similar popu-
ation in any other part of the world. In England
and America, special plays written with special
people in view are necessarily more complete, more
finished in their rendering, than are the same
plays when produced here ; for here the same
people have to appear in everything, and play a
continuous round of new characters ; while in
the other countries a manager has the
whole range of English and American actors
and actresses to pick and choose from ; and it
follows that his production is incomparably
superior to a production here with a limited cast.
But the 4 Florodora ’ production here was better
than that of New York; and no new musical
comedy company I saw on my tour can do the all-
round work that my company can. Next year I
shall keep my principal musical company mostly
for Melbourne and Sydney ; and I shall make my
touring company stronger even than at present,
using it largely as a school for the many clever
people who are waiting their opportunity.
“My Italian opera company is a better com-
pany of its kind than any I saw outside of the big
centres of Co vent Garden, London ; Opera House,
J. C. WILLIAMSON (To-day).

Paris; or Metropolitan Opera House, New York.
And in New York and London a guinea is
charged for a seat which the public gets here for
six shillings. Such a musical treat as this com-
Eany gives, the Australian public has never had
efore and is not likely to have again. Grand opera
is a luxury for managers to indulge in, and we very
seldom make money out of it. Take, for instance,
last year’s American season of Italian opera, last-
ing 200 nights in New York, Boston, Philadel-
phia, and Chicago. Melba, Calve, and all. the
great stars were in the cast. The total takings
were 950,000 dollars ; an average of 4,750 dollars a
night, or about £950. And Maurice Grau, who
was the manager, assured me that no money was
made out of it. My Italian opera company will
play 200 nights between Melbourne and Sydney ;
that is, the same time as the whole American
season lasted, and the.public can thereby form an
estimate of the magnitude of my venture. Other
heavy considerations against me are that the
company has to come all the long distance to Aus-
tralia from Italy; and the entire wardrobe and
scenery are prepared new for the season’s reper-
toire.
“Risk? Managers have to take risks out
here. Why do I take them with Italian opera ?
Because the public here has been at me a
great many years in this voice—‘ Why don’t you
do something for Art ? Give us grand opera as
you give us comic.’ I always replied, ‘ Grand
opera doesn’t pay ; comic does.’ But I began to
yield to the popular demand.. First, I tried to
arrange with my recent partner to bring out an
Italian opera company. The project fell through.
After the partnership expired I set to work to do
it myself, with the result that I am now giving
the public the best Italian opera at the cheapest
price in the world. I can’t possibly make any
money out of it, my expenses are so great; but I
am glad that I am doing what the public asked me
to do ; but while I can get six nights out of grand
opera, I get 12 times 6 out of comic. Before the
end of the year I shall produce “ San Toy,” the
most attractive and successful of all the musical
comedies and comic operas.
“ The profession here, as compared with that of
England and America, is generally much better
off. In America, actors cannot rely on the
regular season lasting more than 30 weeks, and
therefore it takes all the money the actor can save
to tide him over the long break before the regular
season commences again. It’s all very well for
people with big salaries who can take a trip to
Europe, and go to country-places for their vaca-
tion ; but it’s very hard on the rank and file of the
profession. Much the same state of things exists
in England, where they have the spring and
autumn tours. The spring season begins about
Easter and runs to June —three months. The
autumn season starts about September and runs
to mid-December. The player thus does not aver-
age more than seven months’ pay in the year.
There is always the long holiday in the summer
and the long holiday at Christmas. Some of the
people get business with the pantomimes at Christ-
mas, but, all the same, they lose the time of
the long holiday in the summer. In Australia,
actors can rely upon 45 weeks minimum. I
guarantee 45. And living here is as cheap as
it is in England, and cheaper than in America.
When I was in England I was fairly rushed with
applications for engagements, and I had the task
of selecting the people who are to appear here
later .on. The will o’ the wisp dancing in the
eyes of almost every English actor is a London
engagement, and very many clever people work
year after year, taking little outside engagements
in the hope of getting into London. And when
they do get there, unless they are of remark-
able cleverness, there is not much in it; there are
few steady engagements, and, as a rule, people
are only engaged for the run of a piece. Julius
Knight has been wasting his time waiting for a
London opening, playing at suburban theatres at
a very small salary compared with what he got
out here. This burning desire of the actor to get
into London makes it more difficult for art
Australian manager to get the best people to
come out here, but nearly all who have been here
once wish to come again.
“The worst difficulty Australian managers have
to contend with is the distance from London and
New York—the loss of timeforpeople comingto ful-
fil engagements here. Then, again, our operations
here extend over so large a territory, with such a
small number of cities large enough to play in.
However, with all the disadvantages, Australian
managers have managed to keep up to date; in
fact, with the ‘ Christian King,’ Australia is
ahead, for it was produced in Melbourne on
Sept. 21, and will not be produced in London
before the latter part of next year. By the way,
we shall produce this play in Sydney on Oct. 26,
just two days before they celebrate the millenary
of Alfred the Great in Great Britain. We shall
be ahead of London, too, with ‘Ben Hur,’ which I
shall produce some three months before the
London production next March. ‘Ben Hur,’ the
grandest of all the religious plays, will be a big
speculation with me in this country, costing me
no less than £6OOO to put it on the stage.
“That much discussed subject of the temptations
of theatre life is not worth bothering about. If
people want to be tempted they can get tempted
every place. Anybody who is out looking for
temptation can find it anywhere all over the city
and the country. But people who come into this

profession thinking they are going to have a jolly
good time, soon wake up to the fact that actors’
and actresses’ lives are ding-dong earnest business.
People have to go at it just the same as any
other business, otherwise they will soon become
useless both to the stage and to themselves.
“With regard to Melba. I’ve been in negotia-
tion with her a long time. When I was in London
seven years ago I made an engagement with her
to come to Australia. Time, dates, everything
was fixed, but the contracts were not signed.
And, afterwards, Abbey and G-rau induced her to
go to America instead. Since then I’ve had nego-
tiations with her at different times. On my
last trip I met her in Paris, and afterwards in
New York, and on each occasion I had long talks
with her on the subject. But her engagements
are so many, and the terms she asks seem
prodigious for this country. Then any terms I
could give her wouldn’t pay her. To come here to
sing for six weeks she would have to lose 12 weeks’
time. And her time is so very valuable with the
tremendous fees she gets in London and on the con-
tinent. New York is only a week’s time from Lon-
don, and at the Metropolitan Opera House, N.Y.,
she received £360 a night for the season, every time
she appeared. Where does the manager come in ?
Well, that’s his look-out. Artists, as a rule, don’t
give much consideration to the manager s welfare.
Consequently, there is great difficulty in arranging
any terms that are worth her while. However,
she is very anxious to come, as she wants Aus-
tralian people to hear what she can do while she
is in her prime, and for that reason she is willing
to make concessions. Negotiations, therefore, are
still going on with her, and, so far as I am con-
cerned, it will be decided one way or other very
“I have had many temptations to go into
management both in London and New York, but
here I know my public and believe in them. And
I think they believe in me. At any rate they
have kept me in the position of leading manager
here for 20 years ; they have stuck to me, so I’m
going to stick to them.”

SUMMER FAG.

Women are the chief
sufferers from “SUMMER
FAG-” Hard work in-
doors, lack of fresh air
and home worries, spoil
the appetite, impoverish the
blood, weaken the system, and
bring on that weary, fagged
feeling.
TO avoid this lassitude one thing is necessary —the whole system,
and especially the digestive organism, MUST be in perfect and
regular working order. For this purpose there is no prepara-
tion so effective as BILE BEANS FOR BILIOUSNESS. Acting
in a gentle manner, they do not (as many other purgatives do),
achieve a temporary abatement of the trouble, but eventually leave
the system weaker than ever. On the contrary, they strengthen and
build up the old digestive organism, purify the blood, and tone up the
nervous system. They have already proved themselves the very best
medicine for all summer ailments and are admitted to be the foremost
remedy in Australia. A course of Bile Beans will enable you to
move round this summer with a light step and increased vitality.
There will then be no lack of energy or “ Summer Fag ” to mar the
pleasures of the summer season.

The South Wind.
[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
With head that lightens in the clouds,
And feet that flash along the flood,
The South Wind oomes and shakes the shrouds
Of ships, and dances in my blood.
He clove his way through unknown skies,
Not soon to come within our ken,
Fcom that white, lonely land that lies
Beyond the world of living men.
His laughter rocks the spires ; his hand
Seizes the pine-tree by the hair ;
His voice goes roaring through the land,
And drives unto his den Despair.
The singers suave of soft delights,
At these my Great Musician mocks :
He strikes the forest-harp, and smites
The song of storm from hollow rocks.
And I who cursed my natal star,
And said of late that life was vain,
Am borne upon his wings afar
And thank the gods for life again.

As Through Tears, Seen Darkly.
[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
Some tell us that the spirits of those we love and
lose hover around us after death and guard us
from evil; and even that we may speak with them.
How you would smile if you heard this—you who
were always so much a materialist! I remember
you saying that, when you or I died, we would be
as dead as any of those bogged sheep you pulled
out of the dry tank that droughty summer. When
I saw the crows hovering round I cried that I
could -not believe we were no better than those
poor dumb brutes whom God had left to their
fate. And you laughed, pulling your felt hat
down over your eyes, showing your dear dark
head, and asked me why I should think my God
cared more for you and me than for those poor
brutes who could not help themselves—my God of
Mercy!
And now I wring my hands and call on your
name, for that seems all the hope left to me.
For if it is true that we have no after-life, where
where shall I find you again—where fulfil the
promise of those golden years ? If I had had you
really to myself for only a few months—or weeks
—or days—if I had once held the name you have
given to no other woman—if I had once seen your
grey eyes soften as your lips whispered “ Wife,”
I could have borne it better. But that you should
leave me thus—oh ! the loneliness—the bitter
loneliness of it all!
I don’t sit down and cry about you as some
women would before the world. I have no public
right to grieve more than for an ordinary friend-
ship. But the pain is in my heart all the time—
the hot, sharp pain of the tears that are burning
there, tears which my eyes refuse to free. I might
forget, perhaps, some day. Forget 1 I call on the
God we do not believe in to prove that this can
never be ? Would I wish it ? Ido not know.
If you are still alive somewhere “beyond the
bright blue sky,” as the little children say, do you
remember the day we watched the timber-getters
at work in the scrub? They were felling and
drawing trees for the big wood-cutting engine at
the station. You and I sat on a condemned log.
The white ants were in it, and we could trace their
work like filigree along one side. I remember
noticing how white your skin was above the
brown wrist-line, and just below the low collar on
your sunburnt neck. I remember thinking that
you must have been a fair baby. I think women
always wonder what sort of baby the man they
love was. It is the motherhood in them dreaming
of the past and the future, llow sweet the air
was that day ! full of the smell of the sap from
the bleeding trees and the scents of crushed gum-
leaves. A heavy waggon jolted past us, making
a path for itself amongst the fern and grass under-
foot. The bullock-driver stared at me as he
passed, and you said : “ He is only admiring my
good taste.”
I did not but you seemed to understand
that all was settled between us. You put your
hand on mine and we both laughed.
I loved all the world when I had you. I could
have kissed the dirty-faced little babies —the
selectors’ children as they crowed in their mother’s
arms. I held my breath to hear the birds sing.
I went to church—though you laughed at me—not
because I believed in any religion, but because I
must have some outlet—someone to thank—for
my happiness.
And now I turn aside from children’s
prattle. It hurts me, angers me in a hundred
ways. Igo through life as through a set and irk-
some duty.
Do you remember —I ask as though your spirit
were near me, though we have proved that could
not be—do you remember, too, the last time we
met ? The deck of the coasting-steamer was
shining and slippery through the wet. We had
to cross a yard full of drays and weary horses, and
swearing men, to get on to the gangway. I was
nearly run over, and you smiled as you said I
“ wanted someone to be always looking after me.”
. . . And now I shall always be alone. You took
me down to the saloon, and we walked past the
red-plush cushioned seats and the vivid green table-
cloths. Then we went on deck to say good-bye.
While we were waiting for the bell to ring a boat
came across the darkening sea to us. It had a
woman’s name on the prow—my name ! And you
said it was a good omen. A good omen ! And
you and I hand-in-hand for the last time.
Oh ! Life of my life ! Shall I ever look across
the grey sea again without hearing that last good-
bye, and seeing your dear eyes dark with the
sorrow of farewell ?
One day someone spoke of you to me, and said,
“ What a terrible end for so vigorous a man!”
I said “Yes,” mechanically, carelessly. I was
miles away, looking down into the depths of that
mountain gorge, seeing you lying on your face
amongst the rocks and fern, as those rough miners
found you.
What a strange tiling life is! The blood
bounding through the veins, and the light and
laughter in the eyes. And then—a false step—a
slipping of stones and earth—a grasping of strong
hands at frail shrub and fern—the fall on the rocks
below—a little mark on the temple under the
dark hair. And the light and laughter have gone
out of the grey eyes for ever, and the blood is
freezing m the veins.
The end—the end. Ah INo ! Grant, O God !
whom he proved to be a Lie, that somewhere the
parted meet again.

M. BURKINSHAW.
A Box in the ’Bus.
[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
It was a dark, wet evening when I hailed the ’bus
opposite Sydney Post Office, and when I opened
the door and stepped inside, the indistinct, muffled
forms of the passengers quite filled the vehicle.
On my right, quite near the door, sat a coarse-
looking woman with a draggled bonnet, non-
descript costume, and bare, grimy hands. Beside
her on the seat was a fair-sized trunk occupying a
lot of space. Standing near the door and swaying
to the motion of the ’bus, first I looked at her,
then at the trunk, then at her again, and, finding
she took no notice of me, I lurched down the ’bus
and squeezed in between two passengers.
I didn’t care to say anything but I thought it
mighty cool of her to occupy the seat of a crowded
’bus with luggage.
We jolted along until we reached King-street,
when we stopped, the door was opened, and a
gentleman climbed in. He peered round the ’bus
in search of a seat, until his eyes fell on the trunk.
“Will you allow me to put your trunk on the
floor, madam ? ” he inquired.
The woman looked at him, and sniffed, and
made no reply.
f “Would you mind if Lmoved yourbox, madam?”
he ventured again.
“I don’t care what’yer do with it!” she
snapped.
Thereupon he pulled the box off the seat, and
landed it on the floor, where it took up the whole
of the space.
Our new passenger took his seat, muttering
something about people occupying seats with
boxes and that it oughtn’t to be allowed.
Then the lady turned on him like a fury.
“You’re a fine gentleman ter talk to a pore
woman abart ’er box. Garn, yer bald-’eded old
cooco; I’ll bash yer bloomin’ face if yer ses any
more ter me ! ”
The new-comer backed away and subsided,
looking most uncomfortable, but the lady con-
tinued her tirade, hardly pausing for breath until
the ’bus pulled-up for another passenger at
Market-street.
The door was opened and my friend, Thompson,
came limping in with his gouty toe. His eyes
are not too good, and as he peered round in the
dim light for a seat the ’bus started and Thomp-
son lurched forward. His sore toe made violent
acquaintance with the corner of the box, and he
sat down on it as though he had been shot. I’m
sure you wouldn’t like me to repeat his first
exclamations ;it wouldn’t do, really. After two
or three startling expletives, nursing his foot
with both hands and moaning in agony, he burst
out: “ Who the put that —-—'box there ?
Oh ! Good G— ! who put it there, I say ? The
d ought to be flogged.”
“S’pose yer think it was me, don’t yer?” here
interposed our lady-passenger. “ S’pose yer think
as ’ow I ain’t good enough ter ride in er ’bus with
imitation swells like you ? Don’t sit there starin’
at me like a stuck pig, yer low, common idiot—
yer ain’t got brains enough ter keep yer ’ead
warm !” Then she fetched poor Thompson’s tall
silk hat a heavy smack and knocked it off, and,
making some remarks about the cowardice of
bloomin’ toffs, she pushed the door open and got
out on the step. The driver pulled up, and the
lady stood framed in the doorway shaking her fist
and angrily inviting us all to come outside.
“By Jove,” said I, as the ’bus rolled on, “it
wasn’t her box after all !”
“Well, who said it was?” replied Thompson,
quite snappily.
“ Wonder who owns it ?” queried a passenger in
the dark end of the ’bus.
“Somebody has a fine front sticking the thing
in here,” I observed.
“ Looks like a coffin,” said someone.
“Might be a child in it,” ventured someone else.
“Pitch the blessed thing overboard,” suggested
a passenger.
Jokes flew fast regarding the box and its prob-
able contents, and remarks not at all flattering to
its owner were freely made.
“ Must belong to somebody on top,” suggested
a passenger.
“Like his cheek to put it in here, then,” said
somebody else. And then we pulled-up at the
station.
We stumbled over the box and out of the ’bus,
and a passenger began to complain loudly to the
driver. I was looking on top of the ’bus to see
what kind of an individual the culprit could be.
All the passengers had filed out but one woman
who rose from the darkest corner, where she had
sat unobserved.
Quietly she alighted from the ’bus, turned
round, pulled her box out, seized it by the cording,
and calmly walked away.

King Edward, who does not seem to have
got quite so much of his mother’s money as he ex-
pected, and who finds sources of supply available
to a prince not open to a “ king on his dignity,”
has begun a series of small economies. Windsor
Castle servants, for instance, will, when travelling
on duty, in future, receive only third-class railway-
fares, though the right of Jeames to go second-
class has been looked upon in the past as almost
as sacred as the Constitution itself.

R. A. Price, M.L.A., the other day, introduced a depu-
tation to N.S.W. Premier See to ask him to do the eternal
“ something ” to improve the breed of horses for army
purposes. The idea seems to be that if this indefinite
“something” is done, better horses will be bred. The
deputation wanted to get that great milch-cow, the
Imperial Government, to establish a buying-agency in
the State, which it won’t do, for very good reasons. It
seems to be thought that the enormous expenditure of
horseflesh in S’Africa will last for ever, which it won’t. In
peace-time the British army has about 20,000 horses all over
the world, and does not buy more than 1600
horses a year, a number that can be easily got in the
open market in England and India. India buys
under 1000 imported horses, since it possesses a large
number of Arab, Persian, and “country-bred” horses
always available at reasonable prices, and equal to any
but the very best imported animal. For the sea-borne
horse-trade the risks are numerous, not only from the
dangers of the voyage, but from the chance that the im-
porter may have costly animals left on his hand, and be
forced to sell them for sometimes less than the actual
cost of landing them in Calcutta. As for army remounts,
many an apparently sound horse will fail, through some
obscure defect, to pass an exacting “ vet.” The Indian
Govt, is shy of stud-farms, because it has tried them, and
suffered for it. Besides, when it buys in the open market,
it can get exactly what it wants. Not so long ago the
army buyers wouldn’t look at a horse under 16 hands,
now it won’t have one over 15.2. Fashions change, but
horses don’t.


Unable to Sleep, Could Not Eat,

A Grand Family Medicine, Good for all from the Young-

Health was Quickly Restored by taking
Ayer’s Sarsaparilla

:
“ Not long ago I was extremely ill. I could not sleep, eat, or work. My heart would throb
violently with the slightest exertion. My nerves were all upset and my joints were swollen so I
could hardly take a step.
“ All the doctors failed to cure me and I was completely discouraged. A friend then per-
suaded me to try Dr. Ayer’s Sarsaparilla and Pills. In a few days I felt better and it took only
two bottles of the Sarsaparilla to restore me to complete health.
“My husband has taken Ayer’s Sarsaparilla with the greatest benefit, too. It cured him
of indigestion, general debility, and purified his blood when he was suffering from boils.
“ I have given Dr Ayer's Sarsaparilla to my children with the most wonderful effects.
It keo: s their blood pure, builds them up, and makes them strong.”
This is the testimony of Mrs. Julia Osborne, Grand Junction Road, Rose-
water, Adelaide, So. Australia. She serpls us her family photograph, which we
give above.
Good for all members of the family; hence its name
“The World'S Greatest Family Medicine.”
You must certainly be convinced that Dr. Ayer's Sarsaparilla is a most won-
derful family medicine. It takes out all kinds of poisons from the blood, fills it
with life-giving power, and is the strongest nerve-tonic you can take.

A Splendid Medicine for Children.
The cure is hastened bv taking AYER’S PILLS, a pleasant and easy laxative.
