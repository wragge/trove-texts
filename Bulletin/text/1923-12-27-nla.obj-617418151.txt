Literary Openings
Women readers are often accused of samp-
ling a novel by reading the conclusion first.
The practice, although derided, has much to
recommend it. The author of a work of
imagination who has anything in him usually
rises to his highest towards the end of his
flight. readers, however,
still sample a book at the beginning, so it be-
hoves the wise author to put his best goods
in his show-window, Few authors are wise
in this respect: they fumble the opening so
badly that the book-taster is tempted to put
down the volume in disgust. “If Winter
Comes” is a shocking example: the clumsy
and ungrammatical opening paragraph would
disgrace a schoolboy.
An effective opening, in literature as in
■war, is half the battle. How delightful is
this of Chesterton’s “Napoleon of Notting
Hill”: —•
The human race, to which so many of my readers
belong—
After that who could forbear to read the
book?
A charming opening is that of Camille
Flammarion’s “Urania” :
I was 17: her name was Urania.
For a love-story nothing better could be de-
vised. But “Urania” is not a love-story in
the ordinary sense: it is an astronomical
romance. Flammarion probably got the hint
for his opening from Napoleon. The ex-
Emperor, discussing at St. Helena the love
affairs of his life (“He has had, as he
counts on his fingers, seven mistresses”),
dismissed the Egyptian episode with Madame
Foures in one sentence: “She was 17 and
I was commander-in-chief !” That accounted
for everything: the attraction, the fatal
fascination, the easy conquest. Even Guy de
Maupassant could not have packed more into
a sentence.
The heavyweight poets do not have to rack
their brains for novel openings for their epics.
Since the days of Homer the conventional
thing has been an invocation to the muse:
“Sing, heavenly muse!” or something like
that.
Tne wrath of Pelus’ son, the direful spring
Of all the Grecian woes, 0 Goddess, sing;
That wrath which hurl’d to Pluto’s gloomy reign
The souls of mighty chiefs untimely slain.
The abrupt opening of Gray’s Pindaric ode,
“The Bard,”
Ruin seize thee, ruthless King!
Confusion on thy banners wait!
was much admired as a novelty in his day;
but as Dr. Johnson commented dryly: “It is
in the power of any man to rush abruptly
upon his subject that has read the ballad of
“Johnny Armstrong” :
“Is there ever a man in all Scotland”
An abrupt opening in interrogative form
was common in the old ballads; the balladist
started off by asking a series of questions, as
in “Kinmont Willie” :
0 have ye na heard o’ the false Sakelde?
O have ye na heard o’ the keen Lord Scroop?
How they have taen bauld Kinmont Willie,
On Hairibee to hang him up?
Modern poets cut most of the preliminary
cackle about nymphs and muses. Byron
strikes the keynote of his greatest poem,
“Don Juan,” in the first lines: —
I want a hero: an uncommon want,
When every year and month -sends forth a new one.
Historical and biographical works usually
open dully. A bright exception is Victor
Hugo’s “The History of a Crime,” which
begins:—
On the Ist of December, 1851, Charras, who had
been Under-Secretary for War under the Provisional
Government, shrugged his shoulders, and drew the
charges of his pistols.
It was Hugo’s aim to show the sense of secu-
rity that prevailed on the very eve of Louis
Bonaparte’s coup d’etat; and this he does in
a. single sentence.
The older English novelists did their best
to choke off readers at the start. Richardson
is so intolerably diffuse that he cannot be
read nowadays, although he is still worth
reading. Fielding prided himself upon the
essays prefixed to each “book” of his novels.
Scott made his readers wade through long-
winded historical disquisitions and descrip-
tions of scenery before they could get to the
story.
The Victorian novelists —Dickens, Thack-
eray, George Eliot, etc. —are almost as bad;
they believed in starting at the very begin-
ning, with the birth of the hero, or even
earlier. Chapter lof “Oliver Twist” “treats
of the place where Oliver Twist was born ;
and of the circumstances attending his
birth”; Chapter II “treats of Oliver
Twist’s growth, education and board.” The
first chapter of “David Copperfield” is
headed, “I am born.” Thackeray started off
in much the same way. The first chapter of
“Barry Lyndon” deals with “My Pedigree
and Family”the opening chapter of
“Esmond” is devoted to “The Early Youth
of Henry Esmond.” In “Ravenshoe” Henry
Kingsley goes much further back; he traces
the family for 300 years, and apologises for
not going on to Canute.
Meredith, in most of his novels, seemed
bent on boring his readers at the start by
discourses on things in general. (“The Ego-
ist,” “Diana of the Crossways” and “The
Tragic Comedians” are good examples of
a bad habit.) He could do better, as, for
instance, in the opening of “The Adventures
of Harry Richmond” :
One midnight of a winter month the sleepers in
Riversley Grange were awakened by a ringing of
the outer bell and blows upon the great hall-doors.
Midnight knocking at the door is a favorite
opening with romancers; so, too, is the
lonely horseman on a dark road, first intro-
duced by G. P. R. James.
R. L. Stevenson knew the value of an
attractive opening. “Treasure Island,” after
a few introductory lines, starts off enticingly
with the entry of “the brown old seaman
with the sabre-cut,” and his rollicking sea-
song :
Fifteen men on the dead man’s-chest,
Yo-ho-ho, and a bottle of rum!
Stevenson confessed that he had lifted most
of this first chapter from Washington Irv-
ing; but no matter.
The best examples of bright openings are
provided by the short-story writers, who
have no time or space to spare for explana-
tions or descriptions. Here are two typical
openings from O. Henry:—
There were 3000 girls in the Biggest Store.
Maisie was one of them. She was 18, and a sales-
lady in the gents.’ gloves. —(A Lickpenny Lover.)
From near the village of Harmony, at the foot
of the Green Mountains, came Miss Medora Martin
to New York, with her color-box and easel. —■
(Extradited from ‘•Bohemia.’’)
Many of O: Henry’s short stories open in
similar style.
The brisk lead-off, without preliminary
sparring, is favored by other masters of the
short-story, notably Maupassant and Kip-
ling. If our rambling, didactic novelists
would take example by such writers their
readers would be spared much boredom. A
bright opening will partially redeem a medi-
ocre book, while a dull and feeble beginning
may damn even a good book.
P. R. THOMPSON.
Why We Fight
The Fighting Instinct, by Pierre Bouvet
(Allen and Unwin), comes as a relief after
course of ponderous and dirty perman books
on psychology. The Professor, who is of
the University of Geneva, can write, and he
can put liis thoughts into a readable form
He begins by describing the fights of children
—fights with the animated verbal obloquy that
reminds us of Homer’s heroes. He considers
that these children are merely preparing foi
the more important battles of life, when
woman is to bo the prize of success; and i
is because fighting is an attribute of sex that
it is mostly the male who fights, while the
female is both the audience and the prize o:
every battle—rather, let us say, spectator
judge and prize. After describing children’s
play and its undoubted relation to the in
stinct for fighting, Bouvet goes on to show
the different sublimations of sex in modern
society, including in that description the
different forms of religion. He shows how
the Salvation Army is a means of rendering
harmless the fighting instinct. On the
analogy of Platonic love, he calls this pro-
cess “platonisation.” Freud would call it
sublimation; and it is this very term which
enemies of Freudism have used to throw
ridicule upon it. For sublimation is a pro-
cess that one applies to chemical bodies.
To sublimate a solid you first convert it into
gas; then by cooling it you receive back
your solid, though perhaps in a* different
form. To the vivid imagination of Freud this
is precisely the process that the primitive
sexual instinct undergoes while it is being
transformed and sent in pursuit of higher in-
tellectual game, such as Art or Religion. But
this seeming to consider an instinct as a
solid body has been too much for many doc-
tors ; hence, probably, came the derisory title
of “the old mystic of Vienna” that has been
conferred by scoffers upon Freud.
We know that instinct is not a chemical
solid; but the actual definition of it is not
easy. Probably Shelley came very near to
it when he wrote: “The desire of the moth
for the star.” As usual, poetry comes nearer
to transcendental fact than truth itself; and
it is extraordinarily difficult to define sexual
instinct in sober language. The great brain
of man has, according to Remy de Gourmont,
transformed crude sexual instinct, shared
by him with the beasts, into Art, Literature
and Music, not to mention Religion, just as
it has improved the work of his hands into
the work of the plough and of the lathe. Pro-
bably this is true, though I use the word
“improve” with diffidence, for what right have
we to say that anything is better than any
other? It is no doubt better for man; but
goodness and badness are entirely relative,
and when one hears a young woman squall-
ing at the piano it sometimes occurs to a
cynic that it might have been better if she
had left her sexual feelings to work out their
own destiny.
After Bouvet has described the multitu-
dinous ways in which sexual instinct may
show itself in man, he turns to the really
valuable part of the book. How are we to
prevent our boys from growing up desirous
of war? Can we educate instinct? Except
hunger and thirst, which are necessary to
preserve the life of the individual, man’s
instincts do not persist through life, but
tend to form habits rather than needs. Just
so the instincts of the lower animals differ
at different ages; and popular wisdom has
observed that no man is truly happy until
he has lost his teeth and his desire for
women, these two being the chief causes of
unhappiness in the world. War is not
nowadays a matter of the fighting instinct;
it is more a matter of the intellect, for the
soldier rarely lias to fight hand-to-hand—he
usually sits_ in a trench and lets the enemy
bombard him from a couple of miles, or
gets his own artillery to strafe back again
as hard as it can. “War is months of bore-
dom and moments of terror.” The modern
problem of education is to cultivate a herd-
instinct that will be opposed to war; and,
although “acquired characteristics are never
transmitted to the offspring,” still what is
transmitted is the faculty for learning. Our
boys are better intellectually than the Nean-
derthal man; and they can all be taught to
inhibit their fighting instincts from lasting
longer than is customary among boys. After
puberty even the most quarrelsome and
objectionable of little boys usually settles
down to being quite a decent man; and it
is during the few years that the fighting
instinct normally lasts that Bouvet con-
siders we should seriously try to develop the
herd-instinct in the direction of peace and
goodwill. After carefully going over all the
methods that have been tried —organised
games, pacifist propaganda, religious move-
ments, and other means of “platonising” the
fighting instinct—he comes to the conclusion
that the best way that has yet been dis-
covered is the Boy Scout movement. There
a boy plays while he is pretending to fight,
and finds his instinct gradually trained in
the direction oi service and self-abnegation,
while he thinks he is learning to protect his
camp against visionary Indians. Evidently
Baden Powell builded better than he knew.
It is not the first time that a man of one

The Odyssey of a Roamer
Jack McLaren, who has contributed many
good stories, big and little, to The Bulle-
nn, appears in My Odyssey (Jonathan
Cape) as a travel-writer comparable in ex-
perience and accomplishment to the Ameri-
can Harry Franck. In fact, Franck would
regard McLaren as a brother, for both show
the same inquisitiveness, the same adventu-
rous spirit, the same wistful wonder at the
beautiful and macabre. Franck did his best
in “Vagabonding Down the Andes,” and
Met jaren’s book, if smaller, is scarcely less
fascinating in its blend of the terrible and
the trivial, sardonic humor and graphic vir-
tuosity. And the Australian is equally en-
terprising in the travel-specialist’s trick of
guiding the gentle reader through some
seeming vale of innocence, wherein one’s
thoughts turn to the Omnipotent and simple
pleasures, only to confront him with a horror
that dims the day. Conjurer-like, he is always
producing a homicidal crocodile, a strange
happening or some dark rite from his anec-
dotal hat. He takes you into the noisome
Dubu houses where the lads are initiated
into the social substantialities and perils of
maturity. You are led through jungles and
mangrove swamps, you climb over mountains
that appear to guffaw in their gradients at
Man’s futility, and you are bidden to look
down into ocean chasms “of wondrous coral
grottoes shadowed in green, of tapestried
caves from which, when the light began to
fail, came forth weird piscatorial Things
with wide, staring eyes like those of men
to whom death had come with tremendous
surprise.” Sometimes one laughs at the
quaintness of the natives who have been
grotesquely inoculated with semi-civilisation
without losing any of their primitive artful-
ness, their disturbing childishness and
superstition. But soon the smile is chased
from your face by a shudder. The joke of
the unkempt magistrate who sailed in a
filthy cutter as the solitary representative of
Britain to meet a Dutch boundary commis-
sion, gaudily apparelled for a pow-wow like
a durbar, fades from your mind under the
impress of stealthy nocturnes of ash-smeared
mourners standing under tiers of corpses,
rubbing their skins with the “dreadful drip-
pings of putrefaction.” Another turn of the
narrative, and you are gazing dazedly at a
placid nigger who is serving a life sentence
for eating his mother.
The effect of this sort of contrast of frank
mirth and savagery is undeniably crafty.
The attention is held throughout, and the
reader eventually lays down the book with
the hope that “My Odyssey” will be followed
by more volumes of a like candor and whim-
sicality. Obviously, the author has only
skimmed the surface of his reminiscence.
He was in Papua, Java, the Solomons,
Thursday Island and Northern Queensland
for some years; he roughed it in all sorts
of stray corners not hitherto mentioned;
and he has been almost everything that the
Pacific can offer in the way of occupation
to a white man. He started out as a boy
of 15 on a windjammer, and there had a
front seat at a tragedy that, even after
the lapse of 20 years, still pales his voice in
fhe telling. This alone is worth a book.
What he will do as he searches his material
and perceives its possibilities, its color, its
extraordinary array of dramatic episodes
and entr’actes, its curious richness in ethno-
logical and botanic discovery, will be swiftly
shown as soon as he realises the value of his
memories. That he can write is beyond argu-
ment. Here is a snapshot of a hurricane:—
It was not like an ordinary wind. It was not
like wind at all. There was no elasticity about it.
It lacked resilience. it was hard and solid. It
was like a moving wall. There was no resisting it.
At first impact the lugger seemed to lift clean out
of the water; then she heeled steeply on her side as
she swung to meet id bow-on. The bare masts bent
as though under press of canvas. Backstays and
other rod-taut gear curved like bows. A rope-end
worked from the folds of the mainsail, stood out
stiff a moment, and thrashed into nothingness. One
of the crew was blown flat against the rail and held
there like a plaster. On freeing himself he was
lifted off his feet, thrown on his face and sent scoot-
ing along the dteck, to fetch up against the cabin-
top. Whites and blacks, we scurried below. There
was no. safety on deck. An incautious grip meant
a broken limb, if not going overboard.
.Tack McLaren has only to pour out his
past with the same modest veiling of his
personality and he will build a very high
reputation.
C. R. B.
Philosophic Croce-work
The sage tells us to be bold, and again
to be bold, and so I will venture to advise
Mr. Jack Lindsay! My advice is that lie
will give his days and nights to Cobbett.
Then, slightly altering the famous words
of Cromwell, I will beseech him to conceive
it to be possible that he may be wrong, if
only for once. Mr. Lindsay will reject both
my advice and my prayer with contempt at
least, probably with contumely; and I shall
be sorry. For there is irrefragable evidence
in his work that his artistic soul is well
worth saving if, as every line he has written
seems to cry aloud, lie is a very young man.
If lie is not very young. .. . (There really was
nothing for it but the famous four full stops
of Mr. H. G. Wells.)
The first of the mistakes—and they are
many—that Mr. Lindsay makes in his criti-
cism of “Maraud Safran” (R.P. 15/11/’23)
is fundamental and irreparable. “Maraud”
had been criticising Mr. George Lambert’s
praise of technique as a factor in the pro-
duction of artistic work. Neither of them,
says Mr. Lindsay, touches “anything like
the real problem of form and matter, tech-
nique and idea.” And he proceeds to ex-
pound for them the true aesthetic faith as held
by the saints and based upon the gospel
uncording to Croce, who has rescued sesthetic
theory from “the sterilising touch of the
Kants and the moral circus-managing of the
Haskins.” Exactly what Mr. Lindsay means
by the moral circus-managing of the Ruslans
will probably remain for ever locked within
his own breast, but we gather generally
that he has a line scorn for John Ruskin
which is hardly less becoming and edifying
than that which he expresses for John Mil-
ton, whose “Paradise Lost” he says—-in the
most remarkable piece of literary criticism
ever printed—“must always remain the ideal
of all poetasters.” Rut, however it may be
with these dicta about Ruskin and Milton,
there must surely be something wrong in
what Mr. Lindsay says about Kant. The
master and the disciple are at most startling
variance here; for Benedetto Croce attri-
butes the recovery of aesthetic theory from
chaos to this same Kant, who, he says,
definitely conquered the world of the beauti-
ful for philosophy. His .joy when he first
came upqn Kant’s “Critique of Judgment”
was like that of some watcher of the skies
when a new planet swims into his ken, or,
as he himself says, like that of Dante when
amid the terrors of the oscura selva the vision
of Virgil appeared to him.
But Mr. Lindsay’s fundamental error is
that he tries to apply the doctrine of Croce’s
aesthetic to objective works of beauty. The
very pith and marrow of that doctrine is
that there is and can be no such thing as
an objective aesthetic fact —an object possess-
ing beauty—outside the mind. Beauty
exists wholly and solely within the mind.
To put an objective aesthetic fact —poem,
picture, statue —into the crucible of Croeean
aesthetic theory in order to determine the
cause and kind of its value is exactly like
handing over a diamond necklace to an ana-
lytic chemist in order to find out the secret
of its beauty. “When,” says Croce, “we
have vividly and clearly conceived a figure
or a statue, when we have found a musical
theme, expression is born and is complete....
The work of art is always and only internal;
what is external is no longer the work of
art.” The term “expression” as here used
by Croce means what impression or concep-
tion means for the non-philosophic man—
the -original idea or intuition of beauty in
the mind of poet, painter, sculptor, musician,
before he sets to work to embody it in words
or paint or stone or sound. If you ask
Croce the question, “But does not the exter-
nal physical fact, the embodiment of the
thought in the mind of the artist, in itself
constitute a work of art?” he will reply
with a flat non possumus. “The concept of
an external work of art is impossible even as
a concept.”
It is beyond question that Croce has added
much to the theory of {esthetic as a branch
of philosophy. That, ultimately, the birth-
place and the home of beauty is the mind is
a philosophical truth of the first importance.
But to deduce from it that there can be no
such thing as an objective {esthetic fact is,
surely, placing upon it a burden greater than ;
it can bear. Dr. Bosanquet goes so far as
to say that this part of Croce’s theory is
deeply rooted in a philosophic blunder. It
isn’t true and it isn’t even new. Shelley,
for instance, advanced a somewhat similar
theory about poetry, but he pursued this
philosophic will-o’-the-wisp no farther than
that.. To me it all seems to boil down to
the old Berkeleyan idealism writ small.
Nothing outside the mind, has real existence,
says. Berkeley. Nothing material of any
kind is possible or even conceivable. Croce
narrows this down to nothing {esthetic, quite
arbitrarily as it seems to me, and Shelley
goes a step farther. If they had gone the
whole idealistic hog with Berkeley their
philosophic position would have been im-
pregnable ; but, I submit, if you begin to
pick and choose, the whole thing topples like
a house of cards.
And so we see that Mr. Lambert and
“Maraud Safran” need not worry about
Croce’s aesthetic. That it does not trouble
Croce himself is proved by the fact that he is
one of the most voluminous as well as one of
the ablest of European critics of art and
letters.
HENRY MOLONY.
Frank Morton
On December 12 Frank Morton wrote to
me: ‘‘l have a blithe life enough, but there
is little rest in it.” Now the rest has come,
come more suddenly than any of us could
have dreamed : and we remain in the restless
places to wonder for awhile at his
great mental activity. Morton wrote
flippantly of many things, heedlessly of
many things, gravely but without due con-
sideration of a few things; but of some
things he wrote passionately and earnestly.
That the things which moved his passion
and earnestness were the best things showed
perhaps more than anything else the
measure of the man.
It would be very difficult indeed to form
anything like a reasoned estimate of his
work. I believe some of the finest things he
ever did have passed almost unnoticed —
their quality recognised least of all by him-
self. Knowing the man, this was to be
expected. Morton was a journalist mainly
because he could never get away from the
idea of propaganda. He was a missionary
to the heathen of respectability; but what
he wanted to teach them was never quite
clear in his own mind. He did, in fact,
stand strongly himself on the respectabili-
ties, but invented some other more or less
imaginary heights of smugness at which to
throw his winged phrases. This resulted in
a curious and dazzling mass of contradiction
which made amusing reading and won him
hosts of admirers. All the most conven-
tional could hug Morton to their hearts be-
cause he fumed and fretted against some
terrible conventions that were not theirs.
He, imagined a hostile world and a friendly
one and set them jangling in a mimic war-
fare which seldom, if ever, tduehed reality,
though there were always hints of reality in
the picture. It was his pose to touch all
sorts of uncleanness with the delicate point
of his pen and then assert life own cleanli-
ness by contrast; and while* assuring his
readers that the unclean Mias really the
clean and the clean the unclean until he
chose to say otherwise, he would break into
a thin inky laughter, M r hich made the con-
fusion a little more confused.
Yet Morton, M-hen he forgot his mission,
loved sweet and true things; with a real
enthusiasm that had no complications. This
was the force behind all the rest that made
every reader feel the latent possibilities of
the man. His moods and changes made
appreciation of his M T ork difficult, but they
did not overstrain friendship. Whatever
Morton M’as presented to you for the
moment, there was always a kindlier Morton
near at hand. And there was a strength
there too. Morton’s best work may give
him a long life; his worst work will leave a
curious tradition among us. And we shall
miss him in the street and in our thoughts
of the living, and hunger often for the grip
of his hand.
DAVID McKEE WRIGHT.
A Satchel of Books
Poor Butterfly, by Kathleen Norris (Heinemann).
An innocuous story of two sweet girls who bring
themselves up in a small American town. And the
curtain falls on everybody happy.
Summertime, by Denis Mackail (Heinemann).
\\ ntten with a charm that Locke might be proud
of, this happy book treats of a man and a maid.
Through its pages the gav butterfly of the spirit of
youth flutters over meadows of memory lush with
half-forgotten dreams, A glad book that hasn’t
time to be neurotic.
A Triangle, by Maurice Baring (Heinemann). The
author has adopted \V ilkie Collins’s old device of mak-
ing- several unrelated characters tell the story—in
this case a solicitor, an artist and a Jesuit priest.
The styles of the narrators differ hardly at all—a
mistake Collins never made —and the reader is left in
doubt as to whether there has been a murder, a suicide
or a death from ’flu.
Dream, Harbor, by Dorothea Mackellar (Longmans,
Green). Ail the poems in this Sydney girl’s latest col-
lection have charm; many tremble on a narrow
marge between pensive wistfulness and the abyss of
deep feeling—“ Flower of Youth,” for instance, and
“in a Fair Garden.” They are full of color and are
written with the nicest choice of words ; the imagery
is clear cut and the lines are polished—there is not
a slovenly phrase in the book.
, The Foolish Virgin, by George Yane (John Lane).
A brightly-written yarn in which the mediaeval and
the modern are so mingled that only a Portu-
guese setting makes it seem possible. It concerns a
girl who writes the most abandoned love-letters to a
perfect gent, of a Consul, who is in love with the
passion-torn one’s cousin; and after the Foolish Vir-
gin seeks the P.G.’s apartment by night, the author
shuts her up in a nunnery.
The. Owls’ House, by Crosbie Carstin (Heine-
mann) . Fiction that will appeal to the crowd that,
finds joy in Oswald Pryor’s drawings. Half the
book lives in the Cornwall of a hundred years ago ;
the other half goes with hot Cornish youth into
foreign parts and has amazing adventures. Garstin
certainly knows his Cornisliman, and uses his know-
ledge very effectively. And the printer has for
once forborne to murder the dialect.
The Patterson Limit, by Madge Macbeth (Ilodder
and Stoughton). A story of backwoods life in which
a girl figures as ranger. In taking up this man’s
job she runs into danger, proves her w'orth, and in
the last page falls fainting into the arms of the
only man she has ever loved. He’s a millionaire and
owner of the Patterson Limit, which she has been
heroically guarding against bush fires during a
burning Canadian summer. Merely a book.
L’Australie et Lc Pacifiquc, by Georges M. Crivelli
(Ores et Cie). A handbook for the use chiefly of
French people who know nothing of conditions in
modern Australia. The author begins with a brief
review of all the States, and then passes to such sub-
jects as “Sheep Stations,” “State Socialism” and
“France in Australia.” The value of the book to
Australians lies in the comparisons which recur
between the Commonwealth and the countries of
Europe—-practically always to this country’s advan-
tage.
As the Whirlwind Passeth, by Mary Gaunt (John
Murray). A tale of the convict days of N. S.
Wales. The Victorian has taken explorer George
Bass for her hero, and the heroine is pretty Beulah
Lord. How an officer in the King’s Army runs off
with Beulah and marries her in spite of protest, and
how Bass and his fair lady make the best of things
until such time as a convict rising causes a bullet
to snap the life-thread of the brutal husband, _
spiritedly 'told. The book presents a clear series
of pictures of the early days,- is vividly written, and
should find a place on the Australian bookshelf.
Rube, by G. A. Borgese (John Lane). Translated
from the Italian into forceful and vivid English by
Isaac Goldberg. It is another novel of introspection,
and deals almost entirely with the mind of r ilippo
Rube, an Italian lawyer. Even the Great War is
only used to show how it affects the delicately-
balanced mind of Rube, swinging to and fro over the
abyss of insanity. A clever book. Apparently the
author has a high opinion of the women of his coun-
try.. With the exception of Celestine, the married
cocotte, the women show a strength of character and
an uncomplaining courage of heroic dimensions.
Good Hunting, by Norman Davey (Chapman and
Hall). The third novel of an entertaining author
whose “Guinea Girl,” written round the demt-
mondaine Yvonne Quesnoy, is Monte Carlo at its
wittiest and its wickedest. Here Davey makes fur-
ther lunges with the rapier of satire. Julian Carr
—young, charming, moneyed and a novelist—is the
central figure. In matrimonial pursuit are six
females aided and abetted in some cases by their
parents and —in fairness to the sex—ruined in others
by their relatives. The last episode shows Julian at
55 about to be married —a diversion rather reminis-
cent of Schnitzler’s Anatol and attended with con-
sequence no less discomforting. A distinctly amus-
ing book.
New Rambles in Booleland, by Charles Wilson
(Whitcombe and Tombs). This book of seventeen
essays on literary subjects will be the most read of
M.L. publication's this summer. Its writer, Charles
Wilson, is the Chief of the Parliamentary Library,
and a Dickensian. Only a lover of “Forster’s Favo-
rite” could have written “With Charles Dickens at
Gad’s Hill,” a thoroughly entertaining Pickwickian
excursion. The essay on Joe Miller and his jests
is good reading; so are the notes on R.L.S., Walter
Scott in 1823, and the books and ballads of Samuel
Pepys. But Mr. Wilson is not so much at home
with moderns like Galsworthy, Bennett and 0.
Henry, towards whose aims he seems lacking in
sympathy. Still, his range is wide. There are even
parodies on the Spoon River Anthology and an essay
on children’s books which is very compact, although
in effect somewhat like a catalogue. That is really
the main fault to be found with this volume —Mr.
Wilson tries to be too educative and to cover too
much ground.
S. W. Powell makes an observation :
Mr. Adrian Lawlor, in his article “Creation and
the Sub-conscious” (B. 6/12/’23), falls into a curious
error. He points out, quite correctly, that all great
art is in its origin essentially non-moral, and then
infers that, because the poet Gray was a so-called
“moral” artist, therefore he was not a man of
genius. But Shakspeare, too, was fond of pointing
morals. Oddly enough, Mr. Lawlor puts his finger
on the cause of this, seemingly without observing
that he has done so. In describing the process of
birth and development of a work of art, “the sur-
viving image,” he tells us, “is given the concrete
security of form by a craftsman whose emotion is
recreated —always with an eye to the spectator —in
the synthetic processes of composition.” Now, as
the artist composes “always with an eye to the spec-
tator,” it naturally follows that his finished work
expresses the morals of those whom he chooses to be
his spectators. It is not to be supposed that any
moral motive played a part in the conception of
“Macbeth,” any more than in the conception of
Gray’s elegy; but morality does appear in the exe-
cution of both works, for the simple reason that each
was written “always with an eye to the spectator.”
Genius certainly cannot be moral, but the man whom
genius inhabits —who is its mouthpiece—may be and
very frequently is. And if he is not, he may appear
to be, “with an eye to the spectator.”

From the unloading of the\raw material to the final
adjustment on the complete car, the visitor to the
Studebaker works sees every vital manufacturing
operation in the building of a motor car.
From the raw material
to the finished product
It can be said that Studebaker
manufactures motor cars virtually
from the raw material to the fin-
ished product, for engines, bodies,
hoods, gear boxes, axles, etc., are
all produced in Studebaker’s own
factories.
Because Studebaker manufac-
tures motor cars instead of simply
assembling them, the Studebaker
owner is benefited—
First, because of centralised su-
pervision which ensures uniform
quality throughout and the correct
correlation of various parts in
the car.
Second, by savings effected
through eliminating the profits of
partsmakers, it is possible for
Studebaker to offer the maximum
intrinsic value in its products.
“Complete manufacture” is an
outgrowth of Studebaker’s 71
years of experience in building
products of the highest quality.

The Death-Sea.
Life, like that sea-born One
Who rose into the sun
Perfect and pure, a shell beneath her feet,
Rises through veils of death
(That mesh our present breath)
Into a luminance as keenly sweet,
And hears diviner tides in whitening rapture
beat.
Oh, strong, transcendent sea!
When the leashed soul is free,
Shall it not plunge, as into love’s abyss,
Deep in your darkling stream
Whereon the mirrored gleam
Of the uptowering, bastioued coasts of bliss,
Like some bright dragon’s side, or golden
largess, is?
The swift, web-sliod sea-horse
Will need no taming force—
Reinless and glad the naked soul shall ride.
Or let me float at rest
On that smooth, blue-black breast,
So tranquil-pulsing and so wonder-wide,
God’s rosy mountains glassed within the
w'aveless tide.
Oh, spray shall toss white arms
At the cliff-base of calms,
And talking dolphins spring, and foam-rings
spread—
Joy of the curling wave,
Peace of the tranc&d cave,
And sea-stars set on many a happy head.
I dream of life, still numbered with the
breathing dead.

Lagged superfluous in my frame
Till my appetites became
Dulled with Age’s waning flame.

For the old carol-haunted tree's surprise.

Wakened by Adam on the Eden sod,

One Spirit had the daring to conceive

DARIUS.
The Voices.
I have walked within the forest when the
dawn was clear and chill
And the long rays of the morning lightly
touched each waiting hill:
Into silence dropped the bcllbirds with the
waking of the sun
And alone the blithe-heart tuis sang to greet
the day begun.
Through the green and sombre silence went
a little, wandering stream,
Where the gloom was pierced with sun-
sliafts, as a sword each golden beam,
While from out the flickering shadows and
the hush of ways unseen
With a clear, insistent calling came the
voices in the green.
Whence come they, those forest voices, soft
and gentle, shrill and harsh,
Crying as the birds of evening cry from out
the dismal marsh,
Crooning, as above a babe, a little, drowsy
song of sleep
In the monotone of waters slipping softly
through the deep'/
There are strains of elfin music in the high,
sun-dappled trees.
Laughter as of happy children rings upon
the fitful breeze;
There are voices that come sobbing through
the warm and fragrant noon
And a song of strange enchantment breathes
beneath a waning moon.
Where the rimus droop their branches,
through the gullies deep with ferns,
Drifts a faint and haunting cadence; and
the rain's red torch burns
For the spirits singing, singing, as they wan-
der in the shade,
All along the ways of wonder, through the
dark and murmuring glade.
Whence come, you, O forest voices, calling
through the nights and days?
I have sought you until wearied by the dim
and cloistered ways.
Close the tender forest holds you, eerily the
dusk-light falls;
And I leave your guarded secret to the green
and whispering w-alls.

AN IDEAL FOR A NEW YEAR.
A few days ago the Australian Industrial
Christian Fellowship held its first meeting
in Sydney. It might be thought that an
organisation composed of idealistic parsons
and Labor and anti-Labor politicians would
receive an encouraging word from a right-
thinking Christian publication such as the
Argus. Instead, the paper observed with
a curl of its nose that “politics make strange
bedfellows,” and its writer confessed that
he would “feel impishly disposed to watch
for pious hopes delivered with tongue in
cheek.” There are a few political clergy-
men in every State who habitually talk with
their tongues in their cheeks, but none of
them figured in the Christian Fellowship
list. When a righteous paper mentions a
political clergyman it is usually in terms
of commendation, for, whatever faults he
may have, he is, as a rule, whole-heartedly
active in keeping the religion of class and
political hatred alive. Clergymen of the
stamp of the Rev. P. Miciclem, who con-
ceived the idea of the Christian Fellowship,
are, on the other hand, heretics in the eyes
of party bosses and party papers, for they
practice as well as preach peace and good-
will. The divisions which are so strenu-
ously maintained by interested parties be-
tween worker and employer, Laborite and
Nationalist, “Pommie” and “Aussie,”
Orangeman and Hibernian and all the rest
look like becoming the modern man’s sub-
stitutes for the beliefs which were almost
universally entertained in the Age of Faith.
Not so many centuries ago the Caucasian
world believed in a personal Devil, and the
spiritual fervors of the race were satisfied
by abusing and hating Beelzebub, and per-
securing those who refused to do likewise.
The national spirit scarcely existed, and
local patriotisms of the sort that delayed
Australian Federation for so long were un-
known. Nowadays, even the Churches are
hedging about the existence of a black per-
son, with horns and a tail, who lives under-
ground in a furnace, and man is more and
more making a duty of hating his neighbor.
The perfect object is naturally a foreigner.
Britishers found the Kaiser a most satisfy-
ing alternative to the Devil during the late
war, as President Kruger had been through-
out the S. African disturbance. Failing a
single figurehead which is capable of being
damned by an entire empire in the name of
all that is holy and just, a number of sec-
tional hate-absorbers will serve. The world
is full of them at present.
* * * »
It is at this stage in the history of our
distracted globe—at a period when the “poor
Indian” has grown race-conscious before the
spectacle of an embattled Japan, and when
workers and employers are everywhere
organising on a class-conscious basis —that
internationalism has begun to preach the
gospel of world-unity. There is no
doubt of the stark sincerity of many of the
advocates. If the nations decline to get
together and love one another of their own
accord, internationalists of the Trotsky
type are prepared to slay and burn them
into a more seemly frame of mind. It is
the same with the Communists. Socialistic
Tamerlanes lurk in countless I.W.W.
strongholds who would go forth to-
morrow and ravage Capitalism from
one end of the civilised world to the
other if they only had the necessary capital.
This is the true proselytising spirit, which
survived in Spain in the form of the auto-
da-fe well into modern times, applied to the
political and industrial spheres. Tyrants
have often tried to force sudden and spacious
changes on a reluctant world, and misery has
always resulted; but it is hard to imagine
a fury comparable to that which would seize
on the faithful of the nationalist fold if their
creed was seriously threatened just now.
Man is an incurably religious animal, and
national patriotism is at present the creed
of millions. Magnify the sour disapproval
of the Argtjs writer above-quoted in face
of Sydney’s little Christian Fellowship move-
ment by hundreds of thousands, and some
small idea may be got of the frenzy which
would result from a constructive attempt to
overthrow nationalism. H. G. Wells used
the disingenuous argument the other day
that because the United States of America
had come into existence, in spite of many
political, religious and race antipathies, the
United Nations of the World was a practi-
cal proposition. But the U.S.A. are only
united against those whom the Chinese sig-
nificantly call “barbarians.” The one big
policy on which the nation appears to be
solid is that of holding aloof from Europe.
Remove the inspiration of exclusiveness from
the inhabitants of that part of America, the
conviction that theirs is God’s own country
and that outside it are effete, immoral
foreigners, and the Government would have
little hope of organising the Republic for
combined offence or defence in a crisis. In
short, nationalism, in the present state of
mankind’s spiritual and cultural develop-
ment, is a material and moral necessity
without which any given part of the world
would first be plunged into chaos, and next
become the property of the first predacious
rival that had been shrewd enough to keep
the farih.

It would be a gloomy dogma indeed to
propound at this season of the year that the
hatreds and distrusts born of the war are
incurable. If it were so it would be better
for the internationalist crusade to start
immediately, and swamp civilisation in its
own unworthy blood. Actually, vast
majorities in nearly all the more developed
countries are sick of many of their conven-
tional feuds, and numbers have little use for
any of them. Religious differences keep
many Christian nations apart, and produce
all sorts of undesirable and un-Christian re-
actions inside those nations. In an age
when not one of the great religions is
advancing in strength, and Christianity is
fighting for its life in several quarters, it
would surely be good Church as well as
State business for the propagandists of the
sects to drop their present barren policy of
insulting the opposition. • And instead of
Labor journals proclaiming that a moderate
Laborite is of no more value to the cause
of democracy than a Tory, and instead of
dailies of the Arglts stamp sneering at
every attempt made by Conservatives to draw
the warring classes together in amity, both
camps might profitably devote themselves to
bringing a little “sweetness and light” into
Australian politics, an effect of which would
be to remove some of those unpleasant
things that are threatening to destroy Par-
liamentary government. By tireless and in-
tensive education it may be possible to root
out many of the causes of the world’s hate
and jealousy. When that moment arrives,
and not before, the world will be ready to
try unity. But in that case it will act' not
under the impulse of fear, and at the point
of a Bolshevik’s sword, but out of goodwill.
THE DECAY OF PARLIAMENT.
If we. want to preserve Parliamentary Gov-
ernment we shall have to do far more to pro-
tect it than the last generation deemed neces-
sary. Indeed, that generation took the thing as
a matter of course, and assumed cheerfully
that it was indestructible and eternal. No
assumption could hold a greater error. Par-
liamentary Government is not even a hardy
plant that will thrive with little care. It is a
very delicate organism, and its life is full
of vicissitudes. The first Parliament of All
Italy met 53 years ago, amid deafening
applause. The other day Mussolini de-
scribed the once-treasured concern as super-
fluous and a nuisance; and again there was
some applause. In Latin America no Par-
liaments are now taken seriously save those
of Chile, Argentina and Brazil. The Chinese
Parliament or Parliaments have never been
objects of any consideration. The Japanese
Legislature and the Ministry, appointed by
the Sovereign and largely composed of peers
of sorts, has an unreal look. Nobody con-
siders the Parliamentary apparatus of India,
Persia, Turkey, Egypt or the Philippines as
more than a painted imitation. The Im-
perial Hun Parliament lived in the shadow
of the hereditary emperor and the compul-
sory-service army, and the Russian Soviet
lives in the shadow of a self-appointed oli-
garchy—the one which graciously made it,
and may unmake it—and another compul-
sory-service army. In Spain the military
machine, which is untidy and inefficient,
lately set to work at the violent reform of
the constitutional law-making machine, and
the latter was so much more incompetent
than the army, likewise so much more lazy
and slovenly, that the result really appears
to be an improvement. Among the elected
institutions that are sufficiently old and con-
tinuous to have an air of permanence the
British House of Commons takes first place.
But when eleven parties lately asserted them-
selves in that august body some pessimists
expressed the fear that it might also become
unworkable in time —unworkable on the old
basis, at least.
Australia has a Federal Parliament which
has attained its 23rd year without showing
violent symptoms of decay, though too much
secret pre-selection and too much dictation
by irresponsible outside bodies are telling on
it. It has other Parliaments, concerning some
of which the community begins to wonder if
they would be greatly missed. The first
trouble is to get a Legislature elected
honestly. Queensland owns an Assembly in
which a Ministry with a minority of 14,000
votes has a majority of 14 members, and may
be quite capable of holding on like that for
14 years. In N. S. Wales the Red
objective party, instead of being in its eighth
year of office and still going strong, went out
after two years owing to shocking leadership
and the chronic roar of dissension. But it
isn’t to be assumed that the setback is per-
manent. There are now so many powers
above and outside Parliament that, in some
States, that body is becoming one of minor
importance. Thus trades-union officials are
able to use the law courts to collect member-
ship fees, subscriptions to the official organ
and levies made for the support of strikes,
no matter how illegal and unjustifiable, so
that law is really enrolled on the side of
work-stoppage. With all this strike-power
working at high pressure, it is possible to
make “preference to unionists” mean the
total excommunication of non-unionists, and
to make unionism a secret political organisa-
tion, raising up and pulling down politicians
by secret pre-selection ballot. In N. S.
Wales, at all events, Parliament, so far as
the important matter of industrial arbitra-
tion is concerned, has been superseded. The
awards of its courts are obeyed when they
suit the Labor bosses, and scorned when they
don’t suit. And it is plainly told that it has
no ability to create any court which will be
treated any better.
* * * *
It has been declared, amid the frantic re-
criminations of the parties concerned, that
the crowd which formed the N. S. Wales
Labor Government and the Government
majority during two years consisted largely
of men who got in by crime and imposture,
and by corrupt secret ballots, the Parlia-
ment’s own authorised and official ballot hav-
ing been practically superseded. The idea
that Parliament has a right to inquire why
persons of this sort crawled into its bosom
occurs to no one. Such inquiry as takes
place is done by the party bosses themselves,
as a matter which concerns them only, and
the public learns as much of the business as
is thought advisable, the public having long
ago taken a back seat. The Legislature is
largely composed of individuals who are there
to compass its destruction and steal its
authority, and it dare not eject them and
tell them to plan their revolution outside.
It is so bogged by obstruction that the
most frequent bit of news is to the effect
that “the measure will not be proceeded
with this session.” An allegedly reforming
Treasurer explained recently why reform is
impossible, and why there is nothing for it
save to shamble along to financial destruc-
tion and a cash-drunkard's tomb : the Assem-
bly as a whole is for retrenchment, but every
individual member is against it, because if it
started in his electorate he would go out.
Yet nobody has suggested an adequate sub-
stitute for Parliament or Parliamentary Gov-
ernment. Even Mussolini, who declared
that the old treasure had become a nuisance,
was silent on this point; and as all the
known substitutes have been tried with little
satisfaction, he will probably be forced to
content himself with an endeavor to
improve the old machine by weeding the un-
educated, the people of low intelligence and
the criminally disposed out of the electoral
body to the best of his ability. And what
he will have to do we shall have to do, too.
If Parliamentary Government cannot or will
not reform itself from the inside two things
may happen. It may be strenuously reformed
from outside, as has happened in Spain, and
things may become better. Or it may be
wrecked from outside, as happened in Russia,
and things may be much worse.
SINGAPORE AND THE PACIFISTS.
Though Singapore was hardly mentioned in
Britain’s recent three-cornered contest be-
tween tariffists, Cobdenites and socialists,
the naval-base scheme emerges as one of the
Imperial proposals that are in danger of
being sacrificed to a Labor-Liberal coalition.
There are Australians who oppose Singa-
pore on principle, as they oppose every other
form of armament. They are presumably
past argument, since their convictions rest on
faith rather than on reason. But many
more are hostile because they believe the
Commonwealth can be wholly defended “on
the cheap” by aeroplanes and submarines;
or because they want the money voted by
the British' Parliament for a base to be
spent in Sydney or Melbourne; or because
they fear iest Australia may be called on
to share the Imperial naval defence bill on
an equitable basis, instead of, as now, being
given the use of the R.N. at bargain rates.
Their sentiments are already being quoted
in England by the pacifists as evidence of
public opinion here, and it may be well m
the circumstances to analyse the position,
seeing that the abandonment of Singapore,
if it comes to pass, may mean the eventual
downfall of Australia as a free white man s
country. # *
It is assumed bv many of those who oppose
the scheme that the day of the. capital ship is
done. Freetraders make the same claim in
regard to Protection, oblivious of the spec-
tacle of a world of tariffs. All the naval
powers in the Pacific are concentrating on
bigger and bigger ships. The Hood, which
will shortly be seen in Australia, is 110 feet
longer than the Renown and 260 feet longer
than the Queen Elizabeth; its displacement
is about 15,000 tons greater than that of
either of the monsters that many Australians
know so well, and its armor protection is
12in. to Sin. as against the Renown’s 6in.
to llin. The latest American battleships are
superior to the Hood (a blend of battleship
and battle-cruiser) in displacement and side
armor, and their weight of broadside is
25,2001 b. to the Hood's 15,3601 b. On the
other hand the Hood is 10 knots faster.
Japan’s dreadnoughts Nagato and Mutsu are
33,800 tons to the Hood’s 41,200 tons, but
they mount eight 16-inch guns apiece as
against the Hood’s eight 15-inch. In short,
the experts of all these nations are satisfied
that security on the sea still depends on
weight of metal combined with speed, and
their Governments have backed their opinions
with huge sums of money. And well might
the Powers rely on capital ships. The Grand
Fleet used the North Sea freely throughout
the war, and from beginning to end not one
Dreadnought was sunk by a submarine. In
the latter stages, though the Germans pos-
sessed an enormous fleet of under-water ves-
sels and handled them well, any transport
which had the protection of destroyers was
almost as safe off Finisterre as in the
South Pacific. And finally submarines were
hardly heard of in those decisive sea battles
in which ships of the line played the same
dominating part as in Nelson’s day. It is
significant that the upholders of the capital
ship are the men who held the highest seii
commands during the war (Earl Beatty
remarked at a Guildhall banquet a week
or so ago : “To the Power commanding the
surface of the sea the submarine is not a
great menace. The capital ship is a match
for- any ship or weapon that can he brought
against it”), while its leading critics are
Colonel Repington and Admiral Percy
Scott ! The Admiral has not seen any
active service at sea for over 40 years (he
was given a land job in England during
the World War), and the Colonel is a society
journalist who has never been to sea in
the naval sense, and who has not attended
a war of any sort since he served in S.
Africa 23 years ago!
It is these same “experts” who, in con-
junction with Britain’s pacifists and Aus-
tralia’s shabby defence-cadgers, have been
fulminating against Singapore as a naval
base. Once more the voice of those who are
entitled by their achievements to speak is
overwhelmingly against them. The views ot
Eord Jellicoe are known, and Lord Beatty.
referring to Singapore in the same speech
in which he stressed the value of capital
ships, said : “The place has been recognised
for many years as the best strategic position
in the Far East.” In the circumstances
the objectors have for the most part dropped
the claim that the construction of a base at
Singapore is a piece of strategic folly, and
produced the alternative complaint that it
is a militaristic move directed at the national
life of Japan. Lord Balfour dealt with
this mischievous suggestion at the end of
last month :—-
Singapore was deliberately excluded from the
Washington Treaty with the full consent of the
Japanese. Singapore could not be made effective
for offence. Its sole value lay in defence, because
any British fleet defending Australia or New Zealand
must be based at Singapore.
There is a sense in which “offence” and “de-
fence” are interchangeable terms. But the
idea of arming Singapore for a raid on
Japan, which is 3000 miles away, and as
safe from invasion as Britain ever was, does
not bear serious discussion. A defensive
offensive might, however, be successfully
executed against any Power in the adjacent
Indian Ocean, where the Empire’s trade
routes lie. If war comes to this
hemisphere, within the next generation,
Australia’s fate will no more be de-
cided off Port Phillip or Sydney Heads
than Japan’s will be within sight of Yoko-
hama. We shall live or die, nationally,
according as the enemy is able or unable to
close the main roads between us and the rest
of the Empire. Along those paths in the
late war went half the United Kingdom's
food and wool requirements, and the stocks
of cotton, minerals, jute, fats and oils neces-
sary for the prosecution of the struggle in
Flanders and Palestine. Because they were
open we and others were able to receive pay-
ment for what we shipped away, and hence
to remain solvent. Had they been closed we
could neither have sent fighting men to
Britain, nor acquired arms and ammunition
for use at home. What it amounts to is
that until this country is as self-supporting
as, say, Japan, which is now practically in-
dependent of the foreigner in every class of
armament, and until it has demonstrated its
independence by the creation of a navy built
as well as manned by Australians, the cut-
ting of the sea-connection with Britain must
represent disaster. That being so the main
tenance of it represents something well
worth a financial sacrifice. We are not
being asked to contribute a third of the sum
per head that the people of Britain are pay-
ing annually for sea defence alone. We are
not required to deliver an aggressively mili-
tarist gesture at any Power. In the most
inoffensive and inexpensive manner possible
we are to be allowed to join in a defence
scheme which, if it eventuates, should
guarantee the existence of the Common-
wealth for the lifetime of the Empire. And
almost the only arguable condition is that
those who are paying—at any rate in the
early stages—nearly the whole of the piper’s
wages, shall be allowed in the beginning to
call the tune to the extent of deciding where
and how the seas on which the lives of all
of us depend, shall be guarded.
MY ELECTORATE.
From a little west of Morven to the South
Australian border, from a little south of
Windorah to the border of N. S. Wales
spreads the region of Warrego, greater in
area than the State of Victoria. Its chief
waters are the Warrego and the Paroo, the
Bulloo, the Wilson and the Cooper; but it
covers a wide artesian belt whose western
limit should be somewhere beyond Eromanga.


Some of the finest sheep land in Australia
is there —Mitchell and Flinders grass, crow-
foot and saltbush; spinifex and blue bush
infrequently; but most of it the mulga which
never fails* for all the waste and spoliation
of it. Francis Murray, of Belombre,
father of Eromanga, and one of the oldest
hands on the \\ T estern Edge, tells me of
silver-lead shows 150 miles west; the bore
at Eromanga blew its drilling outfit
three times out of the well, and we found
there was gas pressure sufficient to light the
flow and hold the flame so long as we pro-
tected it from the unceasing wind of the
plain that gives Eromanga its name. In
the rains the lower waters of the Cooper
spread 30 miles wide and 4in. deep; and
Francis Murray holds that a dam at
Qontoo would back up the Cooper to make
a rice-field for all the world. Windorah,
too, has its oil and its rumors of oil; and
between Thargomindah and Eulo and south-
west to Hood’s Range a region 70 miles
long and 40 wide is speckled with mud
springs and banded by deposits of brine.
But silver-lead and gems and petroleum
are merely hinted at. The right bower of
the \A 7 arrego is the jumbuck, and such an
area is there for sheep pasture that, with the
large absentee’s pastoral holding resumed on
its due date, and the making of selections
on the basis of a carrying ability each of
3000 sheep, millions of money can be added
annually to tire State’s production. There
are two obstacles —the dingo and Kidman-
ism.
Kidmanism is not the work of an in-
dividual ; it is a system. Initiated
by those fraudulent, ignorant old pio-
neers who could not regard the land
as a trust and themselves as administrators,
it lasts' into our own times, often supersed-
ing the work of good men who failed in the
droughts so that worse men might win in
the rains. These initiators have monuments
all over Australia —in country eaten out by
overstocking and constant work, so that on
some Lachlan runs there is less saltbush to-
day than in Californian ranches which
brought the Australian seed and gave
it a chance. Carelessness and greed
leased State lands and worked them
to death ; Australia must now make laws to
deal with any who run the land on the fall-
down system, who overstock and overeat the
country, and who evade improvement-coven-
ants or destroy improvements existing. The
implied covenant with every lessee is that
at least he shall not leave the country worse
than he found it, and the covenant should
be loudly shouted, and forfeiture follow every
evasion of it.
The Arbitration Court makes awards, and
the System evades the awards by evading
lease-conditions that mean employment.
Sheep must employ white men where cattle-
stations may employ gins; but successful
sheep-farming means dingo-destruction, net-
ting against dingoes and the maintenance
of fences and close improvement and some-
thing like scientific operation ; and all these
the System dodges. It lets fences fall down,
and so acquires larger areas without paying
larger rental. The Law says “may,” and it
should say “shall,” enforcing the netting
of all dog-infested country; and that will
result in the country so netted being forced
out of cattle and into the more profitable
sheep.
It is not only in the Warrego and North-
AVestern N. S. Wales that the blight of Kid-
manism is felt. There are areas in the Gre-
gory as run-down as those immediately north
and south of the border fence. On Munksra,
Annandale, Kaliduwarry, Dubbo Downs,
Glenlyle—all in the Gregory—there are few
improvements worthy the name. On 10,540
sq. miles of this country there were 77,000
qattle in 1897, before any bores were sunk;
now there are 33,000. The condition of the
country was better 20 years ago than it is
now. On Sandringham, once fairly improved,
there is not a paddock nor a yard; and the
fencing on the north boundary has been
erected by a neighbor for his own protection.
There is no finer country than the AVar-
rego in wide Australia—ideal for sheep,
clean except for the dingo. There are
100,000 sq. miles that require only dog-net-
ting on the rabbit-check fences and the net-
ting of a few gaps to be ready for sheep-
selection.
There is another danger ahead, none the
less a danger because it looks remote. Salt-
bush appeared indestructible, and yet in
many parts of Western N. S. AA 7 ales it has
been eaten out. Mulga with any decent
treatment is indestructible; but when trees
are destroyed for the fodder of the moment,
the destruction is doubled by the fallen
timber preventing new growth. At least, if
the labor for lopping be prohibitive, there
should be some system of guarded fires
through the felled trees to produce new
growth. The mulga that has taken a million
years of strengthening as drought-conquering
fodder should be protected against the
holders of the land who think but for their
own day.
Also there should be closer candidature
for the selection ballot. The ballot now is
democratically open to all, and it should be
open only to men who really intend to work.
There are selections held in the names of
women who have never seen the country,
and so are become dummies, even if they
didn’t start so. The land will do best in
the hands of the men who know enough not
to be bad tenants, for their own sake; and
the station-hand and the shearer with a
knowledge of woolelassing who have learned
local conditions with their jobs are better
holders of selections than men taken indis-
criminately from outside. I know of one
selection that is typical. The selector who
won the ballot has never lived on the selec-
tion ; he never intended it to be anything
but a grass gamble; he never stocked, but
got £lOOO in agistment fees for a year and
paid his £l3l rent out of that. There should
be discrimination in the selection of candi-
dates for the ballot, a candidate having first
to pass an examining board. That would
also prevent much of the multiplication of
candidates in the one interest, and reduce
1000 candidates, mostly dummies, to prob-
ably 400 genuine selectors.
But, again, dingo destruction or segrega-
tion must precede all betterment. The losses
are appalling. There were 600 lambs in a
paddock and two months later but 20 were
left. On July 1, 1922, a Quilpie selector had
5502 sheep. For the year he marked not
one and sold none; he killed for rations
108; he had at July this year 4326 head—
a dingo loss of 1368 grown sheep in the
year, and not a lamb marked. On Kyaabva
the station-manager got 56 dogs in one nigut
from one poisoned carcase.
The prickly-pear is at AVarrego River, and
once it crosses the Paroo much of the far
western country will see the dead finish.
The Government must get to this ancient
legacy. Cochineal experiments are said to
have cleared a paddock of the pear, and the
sale of State arsenic at £lO a ton is helping
the man who really wishes to destroy pear
by poison. Most lessees are pear-dodgers,
and the law should encourage the good men
who mean business. I am told of one run
that let the pear go, and when it had control
the lessee threw up his lease and got the
country under occupation license —naturally
at a iower rental, as the reward of his
neglect. The adjoining run fought the pear
and held it back, and the rent was, in duo
legal course, reappraised at 60s. a mile as
against the 10s. a mile paid by the bad stew-
ard. This looks like a survival of the old
trick of the slum landlord- who raised the
rent on the tenant who made a garden in
the back yard; but the 10s., not the 605.,
rate is wrong, and the law hasn’t provided
for the bad citizenship of the man who let
the pear eat out the land of which he was
not the owner, but the tenant-trustee.
Western cattle have been marketed at £35
a head in Melbourne, but the cattle-grower
has had but a quarter of that. The supply for
inter-State trade could be greatly increased
by the watering of stock-routes now dry-
one dry stage from Eromanga to Quilpie is
52 miles long. Travelling stock should pay
the cost of watering by a tax of, say, 6d.
a head for 50 miles or so. But. anyhow,
cattle production will be on the blink until
stable markets are provided year in year out.
Victoria, whose anti-Federal stock tax had
to go when the Commonwealth started busi-
ness, has replaced it with tick regulations
which are senseless when applied to any
cattle but those on the far northern coastal
belt. Tick cannot exist in Western Queens-
land, and the Victorian tick regulations
merely increase beef prices to the Victorian
consumer. But that’s a small market, and
to have any effect on Australia’s beef busi-
ness the market must be big. The best
market of all is the local, but that can't
lie big enough until Australia gets High
Protection. The British market won’t come
back to us because the meat interests of
Britain are vested in the Argentine. One
Argentine concern has some hundreds of
retail shops in Britain. There is a bigger,
richer market for us in America. The U.S.A.
could take beef and mutton and butter and
jams, fruit, honey, w’ool and hides and ail
raw materials. Open 500 or so shops in
Boston, New York, Baltimore and Phila-
delphia, run by a Commissioner of the Aus-
tralian States, with the blessing of the
Commonwealth ; and those shops could sell,
all the year round, the produce of the Aus-
tralian States, representing all the climatic
zones there be. Of course, it would be
Socialism, but even an absentee pastoral
company would get over that once it saw the
trade. The latest downward trend of ex-
change, according to Mellon, Secretary of
the United States Treasury, was caused by
the loyal British investor selling British
bonds and buying American bonds with gold.
From such rats of finance whose loud loyalty
is little more than emotional flatulence the
Australian beef-grower can hope for very
little. We must find better and richer
markets; making reciprocal trade treaties
with any nation suited to the business in
hand.
RANDOLPH BEDFORD.
PLAIN ENGLISH.
Politics as a Trade.
In mockery of the principle that votes should
have the same value, the \\ T estralian so-
called Nationalist Government is about to
go to the country on an electoral distribu-
tion which hasn’t been altered since 1911.
The Queensland Labor Government has
twice won a majority of seats with a
minority of votes, yet Theodore’s arrange-
ment of boundaries was never nearly so
rotten as Mitchell’s is. There are 50
seats in the AA’estralian Assembly, and at
the latest computation there were 169.603
names on the rolls. Canning, a Perth sub-
urban division, with 10,401 electors, actu-
ally had, at the end of .Tune, 1150 more than
the following 12 provincial constituencies put
together:—
Mount Margaret . . 448 Yilgarn .. . . 768
Menzies .. .. 449 Kimberley . . 966
Roebourne .. 485 Mount Magnet .. 1006
Cue .. .. 602 Gascoyne . . 1039
Pilbara .. .. 624 Murchison .. 1042
Mount Leonora .. 653 Coolgardie .. 1169
And it is certain that the electoral popula-
tion of Canning has increased since June,
while that of Mt. Margaret, Menzies, Cue,
Yilgarn and Coolgardie, all moribund gold-
fields, has very probably declined. There
is a suspicion, moreover, that the number
of adult inhabitants in the five constituen-
cies mentioned, and in Hannan’s, Kanowna,
Murchison, Pilbara and Kimberley has been
exaggerated. However, taking the Regis-
trar’s figures as gospel, five members will
be returned by 44,450 electors in Perth —
10,401 in Canning, 9491 in Leederville,
8649 in Subiaco, 8221 in Guildford and 7688
in Claremont—and 26 by 42,974 electors in
the provinces, distributed as follows:
Twelve seats BrownMill-Ivanhoe 2502
already enumerated 9261 Geraldton .. .. 2561
Hannans . . .. 1254 Irwin .. .. 2588
Kanowna . . . . 1299 Wagin . . .. 2704
Beverley . . .. 1887 Sussex .. . . 2713
Forrest . . .. 2372 Northam •. .. 2866
Pingelly . . . . 2436 Moore . . . . 2913
Greenough . . 2499 Boulder . . . . 3129
And those 26 members, representing less
than a fourth of the total number of elec-
tors, will constitute a majority of the House.
The late Assembly debated a redistribution
scheme, but returned it to the Commissioners
because some Labor members objected to
their pocket boroughs being wiped out, and
some Government supporters to their con-
stituencies being carved up in a way they
didn’t like. When the thing came back un-
altered the Government allowed it to be
destroyed by a minority vote. It was cast
out for no other reason than that it
jeopardised the salaries and perquisites of
“Frank,” “Jack,” “Tom,” "Teddy” and
“good old George.” Politics has become a
trade, and its practitioners a guild, whose
jobs are more important—more important,
that is. to them—than the public interest.
♦
The League of Nations.
A plain statement of what it has done: —
The moaning of pessimists invariably shrills to a
crescendo when a rash observer ventures to speak
in a tone not sceptical, sneering or cynical of the
international union men call the League of Nations.
Yet, during the three years of its existence, the
League, if it has fallen short of the optimistic anti-
cipations of its projectors, has at least justified its
existence as a world-supervisor. It is easy enough,
of course, to cite instances of its failure to cope
with big situations, but it is no more difficult, and
certainly more profitable, to find examples of its
effective functioning.
Since its inception at Versailles the executive of
the League has been faced with the Upper Silesian
problem, the Baltic Islands trouble, the Polish-Lithu-
anian boundary business; it has been saddled with
the responsibility for Austrian reconstruction and
the settlement of a hundred Balkan disputes, notably
those arising out of the condition of the young
and lawless State of Albania. What success has it
achieved, and how far has it confounded the cynics?
That post-war development which resulted in the
consolidation, to a greater or a less degree, of
several new sovereign States in Central and Eastern
Europe initiated a long and bellicose controversy
between the juvenile republics of Poland and Lithu-
ania. It was by no means clear where the terri-
torial jurisdiction of the one began and the other
ended, and there were numberless wrangles in con-
sequence. Upon the reference of the matter to the
League a Commission was appointed to tackle the
situation. Incidentally, its Authority was backed
by an international force (the first of the sort)
composed of 1700 French, British, Belgians, Norwe-
gians, Spanish and Swedes. The Commission set to
work with great energy, but found it difficult to
make headway against the obstinacy of the parties.
However, the very serious prospect of a disturbing
little war was removed and the crisis passed. Later
the Allied Supreme Council fixed the disputed
frontiers.
In connection with the Silesian tangle, the Poles
and Germans were passing the time cheerfully in
murdering each other and the French and British
officers engaged in trying to adjust the differences.
The appropriate League Commission, comprising Jap-
anese, Chinese, Brazilians, Czecho-Slovakians and
others, did six months’ solid work at Geneva, finally
inducing the disputants to accept a Treaty. That
was a proud feather in the League’s cap.
The solution of the Albanian difficulty represented
another. When the Peace Treaty was completed
at Paris the status of Albania as an autonomous
nation was established. The usual frontier-skirmishes
followed upon local disputes as to the precise defini-
tion of the new boundaries, and the brigands who
constitute a considerable proportion of these Balkan
communities were fast bringing to a head a most
dangerous state of affairs. At the crucial moment
the League stepped in, despatching a Select Com-
mission to the locus of the disturbance as soon as
might be after the appeal from Macedonia. This
Commission, comprising a Finn, a Norwegian and a
Jugo-Slav, proceeded to delineate a neutral zone divid-
ing the territories of Albania and Serb-.Croat-Slovakia.
Delegates from each country were summoned, and a
tactfully-arranged oonference resulted in the re-
establishment of order. The League’s success on this
occasion was confirmed when, later, Albania applied
to the Council begging it to nominate a financial
expert who would re-organise the fiscal affairs of the
Republic. The League obliged with a Dutch ex-
colonial Governor, who did much good work. Several
subsequent discussions resulted in a mutually satis-
factory demarcation of the frontiers of the Albanians
and the Croats and Serbs.
In the Austrian chaos the League was faced
with a problem of the greatest complexity. The
first move was in the direction of getting the Allied
liens on Austria removed. The Powers agreed to
the representations of the Commission at Vienna,
but were so tardy in acting that the League’s' efforts
were threatened with failure. Opulent U.S.A. was
the worst offender, and mused upon its lost dollars
while Austria collapsed and the kronen raced
the mark to a good second place in the wake of
the thudding rouble. However, the Allies moved
at last, a foreign loan of 650 million gold crowns
was floated, and measures were taken towards some
sort of reconstruction.
As an administrative machine the League has
achieved its most notable triumph in the Saar Val-
ley, which has been governed for two years by a
Canadian, a Dane, a Belgian and a Dutchman.
Assisted by an advisory council of 30 members —
elected by the people themselves and responsible to
the League—these men have vindicated the possibility
of effective international government. During the last
year or two they have organised a comprehensive
and efficient transport service, kept the French
miners from assaulting the German population, and
have shown a surplus in their budget.
The institution of the League has not inaugurated
the Millennium, but it has meant the continued
existence of an international agency, and that of
itself is a great thing gained.
Defence and the Aeroplane.
One of our problems is to develop a force
which, while large enough to be of service in
time of need, shall not look like a menace to
other peoples in time of peace. The 15 miles
of warships which recently demonstrated at
Spithead and saluted the Dominion Prime
Ministers were no doubt a perfectly tame and
well-intentioned mass of ironmongery; but
they are hardly likely to appear so in the
eyes of nations which would bo hard put to
it to raise one mile of vessels of one-half the
power. What sort of force, then, can the
required force be? Prime Minister Bruce
asks that there shall be a fleet in the Pacific
strong enough to maintain a defensive war-
fare until capital ships arrive from the other
side of the world. What kind of fleet will
be able to maintain such warfare? The
Germans had a fairly strong squadron in the
Pacific; but that squadron was obliged to
run away from the Australia. There was
no question of its being able to put up any
sort of defensive fight against that single ship,
any more than there was a hope of the little
souadron of British vessels off the coast of
Chile maiutainirig itself against the fugitive
Germans. In the days of the Spanish
Armada it was possible for a number of small
ships to tackle one big one with a reasonable
hope of victory; but that has long ceased to
be the case. It had ceased to be the case
even in the time of Nelson ; for it is on
record that a French gunboat did open fire
at the battle of the Nile, and was instantly
blown out of the water by a single broadside
from a seventy-four. Nowadays the big
ships have both the range and the speed ; and
apart from the submarine and the possible
charge of a suiciding destroyer, there is no
hope of a small vessel even hurting a big
one. What sort of fleet, then, can maintain
a defensive warfare in the Pacific? The
game is so largely one of mathematics, and the
possibility of anything like real secrecy is so
remote, that an intending enemy would only
have to exceed the power of the biggest de-
fensive ships in the construction of two or
three vessels, and the chances of war would
be entirely in their favor. Where the better
hope lies is in the development of such defence
resources as may carry no threat to any out-
sider ; and chief among these must clearly be
ranked the aeroplane. The aeroplane does
not depend upon the establishment of huge
war organisations in days of peace. It has
plenty of civil uses, and is capable of afford-
ing pleasure to those who learn to use it. A
country full of mechanical wings, the
majority of whose people were comparatively
good pilots, could organise itself into a
destructive war power more rapidly and at
lower cost than any other. It seems almost
incredible that with the clear demonstration
of this fact those who rule in Australia should
have been so blind to our opportunities. Tak-
ing into account cost, the man-power required
and the extreme mobility, there is no other
instrument of war to be compared with it.
It is capable of increasing the fighting force
of a small nation enormously; it is
essentially an instrument which aids the de-
fender of an isolated country more than it
can aid the attacker; the existence of a mil-
lion aeroplanes with full equipment of bombs
and guns in a country like Australia could
be no menace whatever to any well-disposed
nation outside. Yet of all the countries occu-
pied by the white man, Australia seems to
have done least to foster this wing.
♦
Trade Guilds.
Another man feels the need of them:—
A tuekpointer said to me, “Look at that!” —the
wall of a noted public building. “The man who did
that,” he continued, “washed down with his acid too
strong, and the Government Architect let it go. Doesn’t
it make you want to weep ?” Another man, a boot-
maker, showed me a pair of boots he had made. “I
ought to have delivered them a week ago,” he said,
“but, tell you the truth, I can’t let ’em go. Aren’t they
beauts? Look at the curve of that instep! And cast
your eye over the stitches! Every one like every
other, and all handwork.” Those men were artists,
and there are many like them in every trade. Prove
yourself an interested listener and you will find
them.
To such men I always propose trade guilds.
“Can’t be done,” replies a member of the T. and L.
Council, “though God knows there’s lots of us would
like to see it. Why,, if I put up such a proposal in
meeting I’d be howled down —yes, and ‘bottled’
before I’d got a hundred yards from the hall. So
what’s the use of talking ?” I had suggested guilds
somewhat on the lines of the mediaeval bodies of
craftsmen, preserving all the good points arid aban-
doning those unsuited to modern conditions. The
guilds of lawyers, surgeons, dentists, and apothe-
caries exist to-day, their mere existence raising the
status of the members in the community. Little by
little the competent men in other occupations are
being shepherded into groups, partly of their own
initiative, for their own good, partly for the welfare
of the community. Take the trade of the optician
as an example. For many years unlicensed quacks
roved the country selling spectacles that mostly
were quite unsuitable. At long last one State Govern-
ment after another has come to trie rescue of the
ignorant with a bill to restrain any but qualified
persons dealing in eye-testing and in spectacle supply,
just as the same Governments by legislation prevent
unqualified lawyers and doctors from imposing on
the public. When I have been thrown 50 yards
by an unmannerly motor-car I take my broken limbs
to one who by training I know to be capable of
repairing the damage—if reparable. Why, when my
favorite armchair sustains a compound fracture, can
I not call in one recognised by his trade in particu-
lar and the community in general as qualified to
heal the ailing furniture? Because cabinet-makers
are not required to give any guarantee that they are
capable of- curing the ills that furniture is heir
to. So with every trade. I have seen an “elec-
trician” put 220 volt lamps in parallel on a 550-volt
circuit. What recourse had the employer ? None!
Some of the men who undertake to repair five-
and-twenty-guinea watches ought to be taken out and
poisoned, Of course, the unions are largely to
blame for the number of incompetents. Only a few
weeks ago I met an apprentice in the jewellery trade
who was nearly out of his time. 1 asked him if he
was going to start on his own account. “What
sort o’ hope d’ye think I’ve got?” he asked bitterly.
“I’ve been three years making chains and fixing
brooch-pins and doing small repairs. I couldn’t set
a stone. I don’t know how to buy gems. All I
can ever hope to be is what I am, a mucker-about.”
“Don’t you ever have to go up for examination?”
“Examination!” Type can’t express the scorn in his
voice. The business of all the unions is to 'see that
not too many apprentices are employed—not to see
that the youngsters starting in life get a fair kick
off.
The unions—or, rather, the Reds within the
unions—would strenuously oppose the guild move-
ment ; but if sufficient of the level-headed members
decide that the movement is good and legislation
desirable, then the time will not be far off when
we shall welcome a bill to enable sundry artificers
to establish trade guilds. The unions could still
remain on their present mainly-politieal basis.

Rinderpest and Others.
If rinderpest travels from Westralia to other
States, the Commonwealth will have a bone
to pick with the infatuated Mitchell Gov-
ernment. The first public mention of the
outbreak was made at a meeting of the Fre-
mantle Municipal Council—an entirely irrele-
vant body, since the trouble occurred beyond
its boundaries —on November 19. Three "days
later the West Australian, which is en-
thusiastically pro-MiTCHELL, announced that
“seventeen days have elapsed since the first
report of sickness was brought under the
notice of the authorities,” and it published
the statement of Maley, Minister of Agri-
culture, that “the steps taken to definitely
diagnose the disease have not vet been com-
pleted.” It was December io before the
"definite” diagnosis was conveyed to the
world. Nine days later came a press tele-
gram which gave the show away;—
A’ AD:ston, B.V.Sc., who is charged with the
task of trying* to locate the origin of rinderpest,
says that lie announced definitely to the Government
on November 20 that the disease was rinderpest, and
his opinion was supported by Mr. McKenzie Clark,
L.v.Sc., Government veterinary surgeon. The state-

ment about “no definite diagnosis” was merely a
matter of public policy. It. was made in the hope
that the disease would be quickly stamped out with-
out the State having to admit that it had ever
been infected.
The utter folly of concealing the truth in
these matters was illustrated during the
bubonic plague outbreak of 1921-22. On
that occasion a fatal case occurred at Bris-
bane on August 23, but the other States
didn't hear anything about it till September
15. In the meantime, no doubt, infected
rats were carried by sea from Brisbane to
Sydney; at all events 35 Sydney residents
contracted the disease and 10 died. A salu-
tary precedent would have been established
had the Commonwealth Government pun-
ished the guilty Administration by paying
compensation to the N.S.W. Government, the
Sydney municipalities and the dependants
of the deceased, deducting it from the
£952,000 of Federal revenue granted to
Queensland that year. But Hughes was
in power then and nothing was done. So
the unneigliborly offence has been repeated
in another State and, as far as loss of pro-
perty is concerned, on an even more flagrantly
reckless scale.

While Politicians Jabber.
“D. Empson” : “Fine piece of leather that,”
said my Digger cobbler, tapping the sole he
had put on one of my shoes. “Well, we
ought to have good leather in Australia,”
I agreed. “But it isn’t Australian,” he re-
plied with a wry grin. “At least, it was
tanned here, but the hide came from Italy.”
I didn’t quite believe him till I read in a
Brisbane paper that the Queensland Meat
Advisory Board had “arranged to receive a
deputation from the Master Tanners’ Asso-
ciation on the subject of the loss caused by
the bad flaying and branding of hides.”
When my hatter testified that there was a
great boom among the Sydney knuts in
Italian felt hats made of Australian rabbit-
fur I doubted my cobbler no longer. Hides
are coming in from Italy because it is in-
creasingly difficult to get good Australian
hides which haven’t been ruined or damaged
by bad workmanship, while there is a super-
abundance of inferior sorts. Next, a ship’s
officer told me that the immigrants aboard
his British steamer were fed with Argen-
tine beef. When I asked him why his com-
pany didn’t buy the Queensland article, see-
ing that Brisbane was its last port of call,
lie shrugged his shoulders and turned away.
Afterwards I read (1) the statement of
Priministei Bruce that supplies of Austra-
lasian beef handled in London’s central mar-
kets had declined 9086 tons since Jan. 1,
Avliereas South American supplies had gone
up 19,452 tons; (2) the assertion of a
Queensland M.L.A. that “cattle have been
sold as low as threepence a head,” and that
“if present conditions continue Queensland
will go out of the beef-export business”;
and (3) the admission of the chairman of
the Australian Meat Council that “we will
have to produce an early-maturing breed of
cattle, which must be well fed and fattened
for export.” As to that, an Australian
journalist who spent 10 years in Argentina
assures me that one of the reasons why
the Argentine ranchers are beating us out
of the beef-export trade is that they have
systematically improved the quality of their
cattle (ours have degenerated, on the whole)
by importing the finest pedigreed stock that
money can buy. Another secret of their
success is that beasts intended for foreign
markets are topped up on lucerne and other
green forage crops—a practice universal in
the Argentine but rare in Australia. Since
he made those remarks cattle have died in
Westralia from rinderpest, due, in all pro-
bability, to our lazy habit of importing
cowfeed, instead of growing it ourselves, as
all other cattle-raising countries do. And
worse disasters than rinderpest, bad as it
is, may smite this nation of careless hedo-
nists and dreaming doctrinaires unless it
wakes up.

Slaves of Habit.
Henry Fletcher considers the problem bio-
logically :
It must be nearly 40 years since The Bulletin
made its first protests against foreign borrowing and
lccal muddle in Australian finance. Week by week
during all the years its protest has continued. And
foreign borrowing is increasingly a national cult ;
and folly in Government finance is a matter of course.
As well, it seems, talk rational' finance to a punter
at Randwick who is prepared to play up every bean
till he has not the price of a tram ticket to take
him home.
As in this inatter reason does not prevail with
the multitude, it is worth while inquiring what
does prevail. What prompting is so strong as to
over-ride commonsense in our public affairs?
The biologist finds the answer in the law of habit.
We learn individually and nationally by experience,,
which, sufficiently repeated in the race or nation, be-
comes instinct. When an intelligent people have
had continuously to battle against hard times for the
mere means of subsistence, thrift is forced on them ;
it is the price of survival. And such people, the
Scotch, Channel Islanders, French or German small
cultivators, migrating to countries where opportuni-
ties are greater, rapidly attain a competence. In the
new country the thrift habit is less present in their
children, and may be absent in their grandchildren.
In the U.S.A., referring to millionaires, there is a
saying: “From shirt sleeves to shirt sleeves, three
generations.” So frequently is the wealth acquired
by a thrifty parent squandered by liis children. With
Jews the habit holds better; but not surprisingly
so, considering the thousands of years of persecution
and enforced thrift in their history.
But the mass of Australians of British origin are
not of the thrifty sections of the race ; they are of the
casual-laborer, weekly-wage-when-trade-is-good class.
For practical purposes they were wage-slaves and
lineal descendants of the feudal serfs. Such persons,
arriving in Australia, have no prompting to acquire
a competence, but simply aim to have easier times
with the better wages offering. Slaves to the squire
or the manufacturer, they have no experience of
finance in its general aspect. In result an appeal
to their financial sense fails. The opportunity that
Australia offered for a free people to remain free was
not appreciated ; the habit of being a bond-slave was
ingrained, the natural condition of life as their
ancestors had known it; and instinctively they
revert as fast as they can to that condition. For the
squire and British employer they replace the foreign
bondholder. For the tribute to the lord of the
manor we substitute an increasing interest rate to
the nation’s moneylender.
And what is to be the end ? We shall go on
borrowing till we can do so, as a mass, no longer.
Then by slow effort and much tribulation, and by
economy learned by the stress of circumstances, we
shall set ourselves free. The opportunity we have
missed was too good for us; it was a jewel offered
to a child who only wanted a penny toy. Those
who, like myself, hoped otherwise were mistaken.
A FAMILY REUNION .
“Though the Tasmanian Government is asking for ,special assistance from the Commonwealth to
enable it to pay its way, it still maintains a Parliament of two Chambers, and there. is a strong party
averse to using Government House for any other purpose than the accommodation of an imported Governor.”
TASMANIA: “Dad, I can't carry on any longer if you don't help. I wonder what
really is wrong with my housekeeping?"
DAD : “My dear, a girl mustn't think she can afford a butler and a footman just because
she’s got a house of her own.”
Evolution is not to be bustled or hurried, and an
hereditary slave takes a dashed long time to drop
the habit of servitude.
«
Prussianism in the Courts.
In a Melbourne Court a few days ago a citi-
zen of previously unblemished record was
charged with “offensive behavior and the use
of insulting words,” the complainant being a
constable. ' The constable's story was that
defendant abused him without provocation,
refused his name and address, and resisted
arrest. The inmate of the dock said that
the policeman was in plain clothes with a
lady; that he (defendant) accidentally
dropped his suitcase on the lady's foot,
whereupon she kicked it, and he reproached
her; that the constable threatened to throw
him off the tram, and, on being asked to do
so, “half-choked him and seriously injured his
arm.” The second story bears on its face
the imprint of truth—at any rate, up to the
stage where violent action is alleged to have
been imported into the proceedings by the
plain-clothes man. It describes the sort of
innocuous little disturbance which brings zest
and color and material for subsequent brag-
gadocio into the lives of thousands on every
public holiday. It was supported by a num-
ber of independent witnesses, including the
•conductor of the tram, who swore that de-
fendant’s wife “repeatedly gave the constable
her husband’s address,” and by another who
testified that “a crowd of 30 or 40 cried out
against the constable’s brutality. The P.M.
said that “defendant had been guilty of stupid
conduct. In his opinion and that of his
colleague, Mr. David Martin, however, de-
fendant’s was not such as should be
punished.” Nevertheless, the three other
lionoraries accepted the constable’s uncor-
roborated statement, and there was a convic-
tion. It is a basic principle of our law that
an accused person must be given the benefit
of the doubt. There is a growing tendency in
most of the lower courts to turn this prin-
ciple upside down in favor of the convention
that policemen must be believed against any
number of laymen. The same dangerous fic-
tion prevailed in the A.I.F. till it was dis-
credited, and Melbourne, which has just
witnessed the spectacle of hundreds of
its policemen lightly breaking the oath they
took on joining the force, has certainly no
more reason to idealise its constables than
the A.I.F. had. The truth and common-
sense of the matter is that not every police-
man is an exalted character, and. when it
comes to a conflict of testimony between a
constable and an entirely reputable private
citizen (much less a number of citizens), the
right of the latter to be believed is as un-
questionable as it is salutary. It is bad
enough that the infallibility of the police-
man should be assumed where obvious drunks
and known malefactors are concerned. Here,
however, the end may be said to justify
means which often result in individual cases
of injustice. But that the idea should be
dragged into rows between policemen in
mufti and law-abiding private citizens means
the creation of a privileged class in face
of whose truculencies no one’s reputation will
be safe.
Drought lies heavy on the North-Western
Slope and North-Western Plain of N. S.
Wales. These districts form part of the
area which proposes to set up a new State.
Last census showed that they had 3172 fewer
people than they had 10 years earlier, which
arose from the fact that, in the course of
10 years, 10,404 inhabitants left for Cum-
berland county, wherein lies Sydney, where
the political jobs and the loan money are.
The sheep and cattle diminished also, and
in fact, though it is by nature one of the
rather good parts of the State in normal
years, it might be called the land of diminu-
tion. The great hope of saving the live-
stock when drought is bad in these low-
lying regions is to send them up to the table-
land, and the chief reason why the hope often
fails to materialise is that, while it is 47
miles in a practicable line from Inverell,
which is below, to Glen Innes, which is
above, the shortest distance by insanely
crooked railway is 422 miles. The 47 miles
gap lias been preserved for 21 years lest the
closing of it should open a short cut for
trade to Brisbane or one of the northern
N.S.W. ports. This arrangement helps to
explain why both humans and quadrupeds
are diminishing in those parts. A Public
Works Committee from the Parliament at
Sydney recently sat and turned down every
proposed railway in the North that came
within its view. On the other hand a pro-
posal that is being bustled through is for a
railway from Rooty Hill, 25 miies west of
Sydney, population 300, to Tahmoor, 59
miles south-west from Sydney, which isn’t
mentioned in “Moore's Almanac” as having
any population at all. This means that
for a few miles between Picton and Tahmoor
there will be three lines abreast, and within
shouting distance of each other. This work
has been rushed into prominence on the plea
that if cows want to go from the western line
to the southern one in dry weather it will
save the journey round by Granville, which
is 12 miles from Rooty Hill. When a little
business like that, at the back door of the
capital, arouses enthusiasm on the spot,
while the North can’t get a hearing in 21
years, the New Staters can guess what sort
of a show they have so long as they keep in
the orthodox rut.

“Aerial” : As touchingly pointed out by
“N 5 West” (B. 29/11/’23), our postal
registration scheme is a farce. . About five
years ago a parcel containing £l6OO in notes
disappeared somewhere between Sydney and
Brewarrina. So useless was the alleged
registration scheme that the Department was
unable to say where the notes went missing
or who handled them last. The resurrec-
tion of the “registration of contents” sys-
tem would provide a reliable method of hand-
ling registered articles. Whatever is posted
under that plan is handed in open. The clerk
examines it, gives a receipt for the contents,
and seals it. Thereafter each official, know-
ing he is signing for articles in good order
( i.e ., with contents intact), examines them
carefully. The delivery clerk opens the
package in the presence of the addressee,
checks the contents and obtains a receipt
for them. The system is definite through-
out. Nowadays registered articles are
placed in a bag labelled to the town of desti-
nation. This bag is then placed in the ordi-
nary mailbag and is not seen again, till the
latter is opened in the office to which it is
addressed. On the way thereto the various
officials merely sign for a bag, without refer-
ence to contents. Hence the general vague-
ness when an article goes astray. The dun-
derhead department can’t even prove that
it started on its journey. It is time that
something else besides “regrets” was applied
to the situation.

In a Sydney court a few days. ago the
R.S.P.C.A. prosecuted certain citizens for
ill-treating calves. One witness said: —
I saw a truck at the Homebush calf sales on
November 7 containing 18 calves. Nine of the ani-
mals were five inches too high for the truck, and
were raw along the back and the hips. One was
ground through to the backbone. The animals had
travelled a distance of 372 miles, and had been
continually rubbing for three days.
The magistrate in fining this defendant
asked why the Society had not also pro-
secuted the Railway Commissioners. He
learned that “it was impossible to prosecute
the Commissioners, as, no matter how gross
the cruelty, they take no responsibility what-
ever.” This is only another way of saying
that the State is entitled to immu-
nity from punishment where it is guilty of
crime. A private-enterprise carrier who
attempted to profit by the anguish of animals
would rightly be sent to gaol (sentences up
to three months have been imposed on
cartel’s in N. S. Wales in the last few
months), and to be consistent the State
ought to insist on its own carriers working
lender the same salutary liability. Other-
wise Governments might as well license
their servants to perpetrate highway rob-
bery as an alternative to the recognised
taxation methods, and be done with it.

The population of Maori! and consists largely
of land-agents and lawyers wiiose life busi-
ness is to present everybody with a mortgage.
All M.L. daily papers are largely lists of
“Properties for Sale.” Nobody there ever really
buys a farm or a dwelling-house. The entire
system of disposal is by deposit and mort-
gage. The land-agents and lawyers have
been encouraged and aided by the Govern-
ment, which bases its valuations on the larg-
est amount the biggest fool has ever paid for
farm or house. The shark has followed the
lead of the Government and shown the old
original cookies how to sell their land for 10
or 12 times the price they paid for it to
people who go on paying until the Scythe
reaps them. Maybe the Maoriland system
has some advantages. One appears to be
that the ultimate man who gets the land
(and the string of mortgages) lias to toil the
clock round* to satisfy the succession of
sharks who have thrown the land from hand
to hand like a Rugby football. One-third of
the people of Masseydonia do the real work
of a very wonderful and beautiful little
country, and two-thirds stand on the pave-
ment waving the beckoning rag and wagging
the tongue to people to come and pour money
into their pockets without any exertion on
their own part. It is a rotten system; and
one of the first problems the Government
ought to try to solve is how to bring back
capital values so that they shall be governed
by productive values.

POLITICAL
POINTS
Westralian Premier Mitchell admitted the
other day that the State trading concerns
had chewed up £103,000 of his revenue last
year. The N.S.W. Auditor-General’s esti-
mate of the losses on Ma’s beautiful collec-
tion is £447,600, to which the Murrurn-
bidgee irrigation areas contributed £325,500
and the trawlers (whose manager, a good
socialist, used to plant piles of bank-notes
under his carpet) £64,300. From the start
of the fish business on July 1, 1915, to the
finish on Feb. 28, 1923, £309,000 of good
London money was chucked into the Pacific.
And that doesn’t include any allowance for
taxes or the Government’s annual contribu-
tions to the civil-service superannuation
fund in respect of the secretaries, clerks
an'd typists engaged in the smelly under-
taking ; moreover, since the capital was bor-
rowed and no sinking fund was provided,
there will be a recurring interest charge of
£lB,OOO p.a. Yet this besotted State social-
ism is still the policy of one of the two
parties which mis-rule Australia, and the
other doesn't seriously object.
The N. S. Wales Liquor Bill, which was
passed last week, is little better than a con-
fidence trick. As a result of a Leg. Council
amendment, the Licenses Reduction Board
will be prevented from cancelling wine
licenses, while hardly any of the other
panaceas on which Cold Tea sets chief store
are to be made operative. And the relega-
tion of the next referendum to 1928 makes
it certain that another Government will in-
herit this awkward problem. Of course, the
subject shouldn’t be—can’t be —a party ques-
tion at all. No real sincerity can be ex-
pected from the Nationalists, as a body, see-
ing that among their members are shareholders
in big hotels and breweries, pub property-
owners, etc., or men who have these for in-
fluential clients. About the best that can
be said for the measure as passed is that it
has given the Trade a mild jolt, the effect
of which may be to accelerate the pub-
reform movement —a movement which would
proceed if the prohibition movement went
out of business to-morrow.
The row grows thicker about the N.S.W.
Housing Board, that concern which was in
“a horrible muddle,” to use the words of its
late manager, as far back as 1919, and is in
it yet, and never expects to get out of it. It is
a mere bud on the forest of confusion that
there was no sign of a balance-sheet for four
years, and that, though there was a Board,
and the Minister wasn’t the Board, yet he
bought bricks by the million which were
never used, and ordered timber from America
as if he had a contract for a city or two, and
it wasn’t used either. Nobody has yet sug-
gested any device by which the next muddle
is likely to be any better than this one, or
the last one, or the previous 16, but
something might be achieved if the Auditor-
General (an enlarged and enhanced Auditor-
General) had power to come round for
the balance-sheet at the end of each year, and
if it wasn’t produced within, say, three
months, to suspend the responsible parties,
including the Minister.
The year ends with the outlook from a
socialist’s point of view gloomier than it
has been for almost a generation. To begin
with, socialism’s leading literary adherents
appear to be cooling off. The early Utopian
ardor of Wells has mellowed, and Robert
Blatchford recently uttered something that
sounded very like a recantation : “I am an
old socialist, and spent many years in trying
to find a way out of our industrial morass.
Mr. Ford has found out a better way.” While
theoretical socialism is going out of fashion
amongst intellectuals, applied socialism con-
tinues its deplorable custom of going to the
dogs. A cocky who has had his wheat
handled by bureaucrats would be to-day
about as susceptible to socialism as a wild
cat. Beyond the very few legitimate and
inevitable Government undertakings, it would
seem to be a sound generalisation that a
Government’s business under capitalistic cir-
cumstances is to govern and not to trade.
When it tries to do both there is rotten trad-
ing and putrid government. Incidentally, it
isn’t good for the politician’s soul, however
profitable it may be for him from other
points of view, to have many soft jobs at his
disposal. We should always observe a tender
solicitude for the politician’s soul.
The adoption by Labor of the issue of

EATER, MADAME.
“In the expiring hours of the session the Victorian Parliament passed a measure giving women
the right to stand for Parliament.”
THE LADY: “Well, I’ve managed to catch the ’bus; note the problem is to get a seat!”
posed by Lazzarini, M.H.R., and its en-
dorsement at the polls would justify the
British in announcing that their Govern-
ment would not necessarily stand behind
Australia in any more of the Common-
wealth’s difficulties. In a matter like that
Britain can afford to do what this country
cannot. Our White Australia policy, for
example, is merely a source of embarrassment
to Downing-street, and might well be repu-
diated by a British Labor Government if an
adequate excuse were provided at this end.
And what would happen to White Aus-
tralia then?
Theodore is leaving Queensland for a few
months to arrange for the renewal of loans
totalling £25.000,000. He goes to London
by way of N’York, and no doubt will make
some inquiries there before he moves on to
London to talk to J. Bull. It is just as
well for the Queensland squatter and pas-
toral-finance person to realise that Theo-
dore holds the thick end of the stick. Cer-
tainly he and his Government behaved most
improperly over the Western leases ; but if
the renewal of the loans in London is blocked
on that account, or rendered more difficult,
it won’t be Theodore that will do the pay-
ing—it will be the people whom Theodore
has already penalised. “Please yourselves,”
Theodore says in effect. “The money has
to bo got. If through hostile propaganda in
London it costs 1 or If p.c. more than it
should—well, that will be anything from
£250,000 to £375,000 a year more out of
your pockets, that’s all.”
Before fixing a date for the reassembling
of Vic. Parliament Premier Lawson will
wait for the result of the Cockies’ confer-
ence. If the Wee Frees of the party get
the upper hand, Allan, Old, Wettenliall,
Goudie and Crockett will have to either
scuttle from the Ministry or bid the Far-
mers farewell. And Lawson can’t prepare
his plans till he knows the decision. If it is
adverse to the coalition, and Allan and co.
surrender, there will be more Cabinet recon-
struction work to do.
The blackguardism of the N. S. Wales
Assembly does the State a double disservice.
It sets a bad fashion for municipal councils
and it enables an insincere Government to
blanket discussion on controversial measures.
After the Liquor Bill the most disputatious
of the Fuller offerings were the Juvenile
Migrants Bill and the one aimed at the Ne
Temere decree. The Juvenile Migrants Bill
was suspected by Labor of being a sort of
Infants’ Slavery measure, but the country
got no chance of discovering whether the
charge was justifiable, since the thing was
gagged through after a record number of
divisions. The effect of such tactics is to
nullify the whole ideal of democratic gov-
ernment through Parliament. It turns the
alleged People’s House into a Star Chamber
where the schemes of cranks and cliques may
be turned into laws behind the veil.
It didn’t add to Australia’s dignity (if
any) that Prime Minister Bruce should do
a begging act in England about a reduction
of the interest on Australia’s war debt to
the British Government —£90,388,604 at last
June. The plea is that Australia is paying
rather more to ,T. Bull than he is paying on
his own debt to the United States. But that
is only half the story. The other half is
that Britain isn’t getting anything at all on
a vast amount of the money it borrowed to
finance its valiant but often dead-broke
Allies. If the Dominions will share in that
part of the business! they might reasonably
ask to share also in the low rate of in-
terest payable to the IT.S.A.
In the glad days when the confiscated gold
and Crown jewels were still abundant, the
Government of the Red Republic delighted
in heaving insults at Uncle Samuel, that
purblind “capitalist” and “Imperialist.”
These times it is so humble that it periodi-
cally begs for American recognition, only
to be drily informed. that the matter won’t
even be considered until it “restores the con-
fiscated property of U.S. citizens, repeals its
decree repudiating Russia’s obligations to
America, and abandons its propaganda
against American institutions.” Compare
this resolute attitude with the ignoble back-
ing and filling of Australian Labor poli-
ticians who, while pretending to denounce
the Communists, are supporting their efforts
to get money for the bosses in Moscow.
Baddeley, M.L.A. for Newcastle, asserts that
the security for the Russian “loan” is as
good as N. S. 'Wales can offer. Well, N. S.
Wales hasn’t repudiated yet, though some of
Baddeley’s friends are hoping for the worst.
Alec Peacock’s Vic. Apprenticeship Bill
is still in the clouds. Three conferences
have reported in favor of “an improved
system under proper control,” but nothing
has been done. Yet statistics show that
employers are not availing themselves of
even the number of juvenile workers the
present law allows. They won’t be bothered
training them. “Hang the future!” these
bosses say; “let us make some money now.
The year 1924 is going to see lots of bricks
thrown at employers, many of whom have
become as casual as most of their employees.
A Tasmanian select committee is wrest-
ling with the question of what is to be done
with Hobart’s fine Government House (it cost
£68,000 to build when freestone was plenti-
ful and labor dirt-cheap), which has been
without an imported tenant for a couple of
years. Witnesses are divided in opinion
as to whether the house and grounds should
be transformed into Parliamentary cham-
bers, a public hospital or a university, or
applied to the original purpose. One wit-
ness doubted their suitability for legislative
purposes. “Too far from town,” he said.
“People would not walk a mile to hear legis-
lators debate.” “Yet,” ruminated a com-
mitteeman sadly—“yet they willingly walk
that far to see the monkeys at the Zoo.”
The soaring ideas of the Theodore Govern-
ment are shared by the mostly Nationalist
aldermen who control the destinies of the
Queensland capital. A late computation is
that Brisbane owes £35 per head, whereas
Glasgow, which owns numerous public utili-
ties, has kept its debt at £l7 10s. p.h. When
installations and connections are completed
the Brisbane sewerage scheme is expected to
cost six millions, and another million has
been earmarked for a town hall. Yet the
population of Greater Brisbane is only
250,000; in other words, the sewerage scheme
and the town hall will impose a burden of
£l4O on every head of a family in which
there are three children. But Brisbane
hasn’t the slightest uneasiness about the
future. Isn’t the Commonwealth Bank the
benevolent patron of all big-city local bodies
with grandiose schemes of “improvements,”
and isn’t Theodore off to N’York and Hondou
to arrange for the renewal, at ampler rates
of interest, of the 34 and 4 p.c. loans falling
due on July 1 (£12,707,000 altogether), and
to borrow further millions- —if he can get
them ?
Even half a crumb of reform is better
than no bread. The State railways are mort-
gaged for more than they are worth, judging
by the returns, and odd mortgages are always
falling due, and being renewed at exorbitant
interest. Every system lives on the edge of
bankruptcy, and will go over if anything hap-
pens and the lender can’t renew. The lines
are ageing, and there is no deterioration
fund ; and any day an invention may come
along to send the whole lot to the scrap-
heap. In any case it is a load off the mind
to be out of debt. Spurred by these and
other considerations, the Eawson Govern-
ment has decided to put the Vic. rail-
way surplus when there is one (there have
been two in the last nine years) to a special
railways sinking fund. Overcome with emo-
tion the fund, started with £1557.
“Are We Over-educated?” was a heading
which appeared in at least two papers
because Dr. O’Reilly, of Sydney, made some
pertinent remarks to the Marist College about
the undue rush of Australia junior into the
“learned professions.” The silly question is
proof that some of us, anyhow, are not. All
that is the matter is that most of us don’t get
the right education. There is no restriction
on the number of apprentice dentists, doctors
and lawyers, and the way into the unions of
these trades is simply by proving that the
applicant has learned the business. But the
way to become a learned bricklayer is so
hedged in, and the immediate inducements
held out to be something less useful are so
great, that the youth who ought to be a
builder becomes a mere barrister or bishop
when he doesn’t turn to muck-shifting.
Blakeley, of the Federal Labor party and
Public Works Committee, came back from
the Northern Territory to report that it is a
disappointing place, and that the North-to-
South line would be “insanity.” In the same
speech he pointed out that the N.T. is really
a good sort of place which “must be de-
veloped,” and that an East-to-West line
across it, to carry the trade into the land of
Theodore of Queensland, and to the very
inferior port of would be a bril-
liant idea. The fact that S.A. has paid for
the North-to-South line in didn’t
even get a mention, as usual. There are
places besides Potsdam where scraps of paper
don’t count.
WAR FRUIT.
[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
These are the fruits of war,
Borne to the ends of the earth;
Bite in them, deep to the core—
Taste them and judge of their worth!
Home have the fighting men come
From the part that was theirs,
Glad while the thundering drum
And the cheers drowned their pain and their cares ;
Seeking no more than respite,
Than an hour to forget;
Proud to have bled for a right,
To have mingled their blood with their sweat;
Feted and fed for a day,
While the fevers ran hot;
Given the last of their pay,
And patched by the quacks and forgot;
Carrying wounds that are white
With the promise of death ;
bungs that are raw in the night
And spew blood on the heels of their breath;
Eyes that are shuttered for aye
From the stars and the earth;
Cheeks that are marked with the grey
Of dead things and the lines of dead mirth;
Brains that are haunted with hells
That they cannot forget;
Fears that steal out from their cells,
Till the strongest and bravest regret—
These are the fruits of a war,
Borne to the ends of the earth ;
Bite in them, deep to the core —
Taste them and judge of their worth!
Silent the song of the drum,
And the cheers are no more;
So have the fighting men come
To the glorious guerdons of war.

The Colonial Mutual Fire has been recover-
ing from its venture in marine underwriting
in London. A couple of years ago the man-
agement became impressed with the per-
formances of others, and thought it also
could harvest profits in that notoriously un-
certain field. There was no difficulty in
writing business, and premium income sud-
denly leapt £75,000; but the co.’s luck was
out —it had picked the wrong time for the
adventure. When losses instead of profits
began to show up, the management with-
drew as quickly as it could; but before it got
clear the 1921 financial year had shown an
underwriting loss of £21,583, and that was
only £1713 less than investment earnings.
The past 12 months no doubt also carried a
little of the losses and expenditure incurred
in the experiment, but the co.’s position had
recovered sufficiently to give shareholders
10 p.c. without difficulty. The profit of
£43,117 shown by the introductory table was
made up of £22,293 surplus on underwriting
and £21,824 of interest earnings, less a vote
of £lOOO to a staff fund. This result was
highly satisfactory to old hands, because of
the £300,008 of paid capital no less than
£200,003 is capitalised profit. The course
of underwriting for many years is shown by
the following comparisons :

Last year losses and expenses absorbed 91.5
p.c. of net premium income; in the pre-
vious one 108.1 p.c. The outgo is
still much heavier than in pre-war years:
1912, 84.4 p.c.; 1913, 82.9 p.c.; 1914, 88.5
p.c. The business has not expanded ivitb
anything like the rapidity noted in most other
offices, and the higher loss and cost rates con-
sequently give smaller net profits. Neverthe-
less. the volume of business is quite sufficient
to give shareholders good returns under nor-
mal conditions.
The payment of high rates of dividends on
a capital which is two-third bonus scrip has
meant tapping profits to a greater extent
than in most offices. Take the United, of
Sydney, as an example. The net premium
income of the two is much the same ; the
United’s paid capital at September 30 was
£25,€00 larger, and £225,000 of its £325,000
capital was bonus scrip. For the past 12
months both offices paid 10 p.c., but the
United laid aside £42.339 against the Colonial
Mutual's £13,116. During the past 10 years
the United has paid £194,000 in divs. and
put £395,451 into reserves. In the same
period the Colonial Mutual has distributed
£320.508 and reserved only £91,405. While
the Sydney co.. has been strengthening its
position to assure its future, the principal
concern of the Melbourne co. seems to have
been to give shareholders an immediate feed.
To pay 74 p.c. for 1921 £20,000 was with-
drawn from the reserve of unearned pre-
miums, but for the past 12 months £12,500
was replaced. The total in that account is
now £42,500; but on the basis that 40 p.c.
of a year’s net premium income is a neces-
sary provision to reinsure unexpired risks
that reserve should amount to £104,400.
Consequently, shareholders can look upon
only approximately £38,100 of the £lOO,OOO
in the reserve fund as a true profit-accumu-
lation. However, though shareholders have
been ravenous as each year’s cake has come
from the underwriting oven and they have
left only a few crumbs, the position so far
as policy-holders are concerned looks quite
satisfactory. Capital and reserves amount
to £444,095, which is equal to 170 p.c. on
last year’s £261,060 net premium income.
That' is 20 points better than is generally
regarded as a reasonably good proportion of
funds to risks. How funds are invested is
shown next:—

The co. lias gone into new premises, and that
account has more than doubled in two years.
To finance the outlay on the new building
the holdings of public securities and cash
have been reduced by almost £72,000. Never-
theless, just two-thirds of all assets are still
liquid.

Taking the revenue account of the Ordinary
branch separately, this three-year-old life co.
would appear to have had a remarkably suc-
cessful run. It showed a surplus of £00,U48
over and above all claims and exes., the
latter including £2074 for “extension and
organisation of branches” and £517 brokerage
Oil new shares sold. The excess of outgo
over income in the Industrial branch
(£8251) was also charged against Ordi-
nary income; and £19,550 was taken as an
“appropriation in reduction of establishment
account.” Even then £22,247 was left to put
into an assurance fund. The writing oft ot
£l9 550 from establishment account at that
stage would be a notable achievement if the
happening was all it seemed at first glance,
for it would have meant the reduction of
the account to £450. Actually, it stands at
£lB 900 in the balance-sheet, because, while
£19’,550 was struck off with the aid of the
year’s “surplus,” exes, totalling £18,400 more
were incurred during the 12 months. Conse-
quently all-in costs for the period were
£88,568 instead of £70.118 disclosed by the
revenue accounts. Though the management
has done the proper thing by reducing the
establishment account, it can be regarded
only as a book adjustment, and is liable to
re-arrangement when the first valuation ot
policies is undertaken. The directors do not
mention when it is proposed to call m an
actuary to estimate liabilities under policies;
presumably the investigation will be under-
taken at tiie end of the fifth year.
Until a valuation of policies is submitted,
neither the management nor anybody else
can determine the precise position of the
P. and C. In three years the co. has wwitten
more than five millions of assurances, but
the quantity still alive is not disclosed.
To July 31 last premiums and interest had
given a*total income of £233,474; claims took
£5637; and exes., including establishment
and extension of business costs, but over-
looking £14,000 paid (in shares) to pro-
moters, amounted to £221.436. Consequently,
in three years the surplus of income over
all outgo has been only £6401. The question
is how much more than that is required for
existing actuarial obligations under policies,
and the position of the office depends on how
much of intact capital—there is £102,9;>b
of paid capital, but £14,000 was paid for
goodwill—is required for policy reserves.
The large volume of business on the books
indicates that a substantial amount is re-
quired. However, at this stage this much
is definitely visible: the P. and C- has done
much better than most of its young com-
petitors. For a start, 85 P-c. of the policies
in force are life business, which necessitates
smaller reserves in earlier years. Its cost
rate is also much less severe: even if the
whole of last year’s £18,450 extra establish-
ment outlay is charged against Ordinary
operations, that branch showed £108,141 ot
premium income to have been won at a cost
of £75.493. For every £5 of renewal pre-
miums almost £4 was received from much
more costly new business, and on the reckon-
ing that new business costs are 10 times
those for renewals, the expense rates
were 14.1 p.c. and 141 p.c. respectively.
That is a creditable performance. It
would be much more cheerful if the future of
the Industrial branch was less obscure.
Costs there last year ran into 272 p.c.;
against income of £4822 was a deficit of
£8251. borne by the Ordinary department,
and that did not take into account the lia-
bility under policies. There’s nothing in
Industrial business if handled in small quan-
tities. atid several older offices have recently
abandoned the field altogether. The P. and
C. directors talk of Industrial operations
being a “feeder" for Ordinary activities;
that certainly is the case when the business
talks in tens and hundreds of thousands,
but when operated in a comparatively small
way an Industrial department is more
likely to prove a sucker on the Ordinary
branch.
• •••*«
The P. and C.’s position so far as policy-
holders are concerned is as follows : At July
31 there were tangible assets for £109,577
and creditor accounts totalling £13,460,
leaving £96,117 available to cover whatever
may be the actuarial liability under policies.
That protection is no doubt considerably in
excess of present requirements; but what
concerns the policy-holder is the security for
the future, when policies gradually approach
maturity. That cannot be forecasted, be-
cause everything depends on how econo-
mically the business is conducted dur-
ing the years when provisions should be made
for steadily accruing liabilities. So far as
shareholders are concerned, the prospectus
anticipation that the co. would be “working
on a profitable basis" within six months of
flotation has proved quite as ludicrous as
the “Wild Cat” said it would. In three
years to July last £7599 of £102,956 of capi-
tal had become represented by intangible
assets and the balance was liable for every
penny which an actuary would decide was
required for an assurance fund to cover the
estimate of policy commitments. Assets at
the balance were: Government securities,
£30,051; mortgages, £14,837; book debts and
agency balances, £28,864; outstanding pre-
miums, £11,558; office and field equipment,
£9242; surplus of cash and accrued interest
over and above sundry creditors, £1562. One
feature of the P. and C. is that agency agree-
ments were made with co-operative farmers’
cos. throughout the Commonwealth under
which their staffs seek business for it.
These arrangements have been responsible
for a very large business having been written
in quick time at expense rates lower than
experienced by most other young offices.

The Fourth Victoria has been making the
pace a cracker. Every penny that has come
within the management’s reach has been
promptly lent on mortgage, and the volume
of advances is now practically 2& times
greater than it was only six years ago. To
reach these figures the directors have
gathered in £290,(X)0 more deposits, lent out
all cash received from the sale of premises
and foreclosed properties, and also the
£34,521 of share premiums received during
the past year on the new issue replacing the
terminating capital which had matured. The
advances business shows an astonishing
growth when the extent of the repayments
of principal during the period is taken into
account. For instance, during the past 12
months £305,000 was paid back and £388,000
of new advances were granted. No other
Australian building society has shown such
confidence in the future, or placed so much
faith in the continuance of existing high
values, as the Fourth Victoria, which is by
far the biggest of the family. While others
have struggled to attract deposits, this one,
apparently, has had no difficulty in raising
all the money it wanted. That is accounted
for by its connection with the National
Mutual Life, which is the biggest share-
holder and depositor. National Mutual
general-manager and actuary E. J. Stock and
director Edward Trenchard are both on the
Fourth Victoria Board. Whether the direc-
tors have been wise in rushing new business
as they have is for the future to disclose.
No doubt the margins between existing
property values and the advances have been
watched carefully, and the demand on the
societies has been so heavy that it has been
possible for managements to select their
clients. In this instance, too, the average
of advances is small: 12 months ago the
management announced that it was less than
£4OO.
The National Mutual’s interest in the
society gives it a standing different from
most others. One of the greatest risks of a
building society in depressed times is the
possible sudden withdrawal of deposits. The
big life office is not likely to want its money
in a hurry, and a lot of the Fourth Victoria’s
deposits are “fixed” much firmer than that
term usually implies. Moreover, if the
building society did experience a cold spell,
it would be to the interests of the National
Mutual to nurse it. The next table gives a
general view of how the society’s position has
altered in a half-dozen years:—

At October 31 there were advances and
premises with a book value of £1,138,348,
which was £515,900 more than all liabilities.
Put another way, every £1 borrowed had
the backing of 365. 6d. of assets. Paid
capital is £287,675, and there are £213,347
of reserves. That means that almost one-
fifth of tlje book value of advances could be
lost before any capital would be endangered.
The size of reserves in relation to paid capi-
tal also explains how the society manages to
pay 10 p.c. divs. and put substantial amounts
into reserve.

Twelve months ago this hotel co. was in
trouble. Its reputation had frayed, and the
naicest people were passing by its doors
with a shrug. Consequently profits had
dwindled; but the only explanation directors
gave was that they had “to contend against
circumstances over which they had no control."
In the face of the serious loss of trade and the
condition of the property, that was a lame
excuse. In desperation they called in J.
Levy, formerly many years manager of
Usher’s Metropolitan, and later of the
Grand Hotel, Auckland. His first jobs were
to restore the good name of the Carlton,
while effecting improvements, replacements
and renovations to remedy its down-at-heel
appearance. It was a tough job, but the
directors made available the necessary
funds, and half-way through the past finan-
cial year saw a definite turning-point. Con-
sidering that practically little, if any, profit
was made in the earlier months, and that
earnings were tapped to pay for renovations
and renewals, the co. did fairly well to in-
crease net profits by £2OOO-odd on the previ-
ous year. But that did not justify the direc-
tors paying 7 p.c. on ordinaries, that rate
requiring £689 more than the profit avail-
able and reducing reserves ,to a trifle of
£742. No doubt the improved earnings dur-
ing the latter portion of the period prompted
the distribution, but with a bank overdraft
of £6295, sundry creditors for £3781 and a
mortgage £47,000, there are other things to
consider besides shareholders’ divs.
Manager Levy has a difficult problem
ahead to make the Carlton live up to the
prospectus inducements which brought the
public in. The co. was promoted to take
the business off the hands of Joynton Smith,
It. P. Blundell and others who established
it in 1913. Original cost was not disclosed.
The sale price to the co. was £123,500, which
(vas some thousands less than valuations
inade in 1920, though no doubt it gave a
handsome profit on the first outlay. The
public subscribed £52,000 in ordinaries,
£50,000 was covered by a first-mortgage
debenture carrying 8 p.c., and the balance
of the vendors’ price was met by an allot-
ment of £20,000 of 8 p.c. profs. The pro-
motion consideration was 8000 fully-paid
ordinaries. Subscribers were told that pro-
fits could “be safely estimated at about
£lB,OOO p.a.” That was on the strength
of earnings for the previous 10 months only,
though why figures for five or six years were
not disclosed by the vendors was a mystery.
The present position of the concern is as
follows: Paid capital is £BO,OOO, £20,000 of
it 8 p.c. pref. scrip. There is a £47,000
mortgage on the property, and at October
31 £10,076 was owing to the bank and sun-
dry creditors. Liquid assets (including
stocks and book debts - ) totted up £Bll2,
leaving an excess of floating debt over and
above floating assets of £1964. The whole
of the capital, mortgage and a little other
money is, therefore, in fixed assets.. Besides
finding divs. for shareholders and maintain-
ing the property in good order, in the 394
years which the lease has to run the man-
agement will be obliged to lay by sufficient
to repay the £47,000 mortgage and £BO.OOO
of capital, less the value that furnishings
and movable equipment and the liquor
license may have at the expiry of the lease.
Assuming these assets to be worth, say.
£17,000 in 1963, the co. by that time would
have to make provision for the repayment of
about £llO,OOO. To recover that requires
the investment in realisable assets of about

Metals Manufactures, Ltd., of Port
Kembla (N.S.W.), helped Hampden Clon-
curry (Q.) out of the ditch during the last
six months: Hampden received 20 p.c. on its
holding there. With copper low and costs
high, mining was out of the question. This
idleness set Erie Huntley free to get things
moving at New Guinea Copper. To keep the
mines and plant in trim took £6000; almost
£3OOO more went in head-office charges. How-
ever, £10,851 dropped into the till from divs.
on share interests. There muxs a credit
balance of £2643, and it and £5500 taken from
equalisation account went into the reserve
for depreciation. Nearly all the mines are
partly or completely full of water, but a
little tributing goes on at the Wallaroo,
McGregor and Magnet. There are liquid
assets (apart from shares) of £68,469 to set
against debts of £39,964, the worst blister
being £35,499 due to the bank. Investments
include 78,715 shares in Metal Manufac-
tures, Ltd., and 6315 shares in the Electro-
lytic Refining and Smelting Co.

The old Hill End field (N.S.W.) has had
a wretched year, despite efforts to revive
some of the old shows by changes of names
and by searching for pay veins in old work-
ings. Last week the Hawkins Hill South,
which is an offshoot of Hawkins Hill, alias
Marshall’s Hill End, reported finding a reef
about Bin. wide going 340 z. 10ft. down a
winze in the tunnel 800 ft. below the cap.
The Hunter-street office has exhibited solid
blocks of white quartz with xi yellow sprink-
ling, but such finds now fail to impress the
market. The re-opening of the old field a
few years ago was followed by haphazard
pig-rooting in old workings instead of com-
prehensive pi’ospecting in likely new ground.
The best values were sighted in Pitt-street
scnp-crushings, and the attempts to make
batteries talk louder than ore reserves could
have only one ending. Hill End is again a
back-number.

Billapaloola reefs, near Tumut
(N.S.W.), which have been given a
chance by mining-engineer A. P. Penman
(B. 20/12/’23), are to be developed by
Mountain Range Gold Options, N.L., a co.
of 22,000 ss. shares, in which W. J. Lees and
W. LI. Vidler, two of the pluckiest sup-
porters of N. 8. Wales gold finds, and E. A.
Carey and W. A. Harrison arc the leading
lights. It is an option and developmental
co. only, and is to allot 10,000 fully-paids
(£2500) to W. A. Harrison and his party
for their option. It has until May 1 to
finalise work, but has to pay £5OO on March
1. If the properties are taken over, the co. to
be formed is to pay £3OOO cash and a twelfth
interest, plus 1400 shares. But all that
is for the future, and the justification for
the price asked depends on development.
Mountain Range is offering 12,000 contribs.
to the public, payable in sixpenny instal-
ments, and at least £lOOO is to be spent in
opening up and testing the reefs. Two have
been exposed; shafts down 50 and 60 feet
and a 90ft. tunnel have proved one reef,
apparently of true fissure type, to average
24ft. The Big Reef, on the adjoining lease,
has been exposed by open-cut down to 18ft.,
the gold-bearing formation going Sft. wide.
Values so far have averaged from a ’weight
to 16dwt. in the tunnel, and from 4dwt. to
3oz. in the shafts. The next step is to
prove tonnages and prospective averages of
battery feed.

J. S. Sutherland’s prospecting for the
reefs which shed the Iviandra (N.S.W.) allu-
vial has developed into a co. of 200,000 4s.
shares, of which 66,650 fully-paids and
£3500 cash go to Sutherland, who
undertakes to place 25,000 of the
133,350 conti’ibs. The vendor’s cash
consideration is covered partly by £6OO
of plant, machinery and stores on hand and
by ore at grass assayed as worth £1350. One-
third of the balance of contribs. have been
underwritten by the co.’s solicitors: Charlie
Jaques, of Stephen, Jaques and Stephen, is a
director. The leases total 100 acres. A
mainsliaft is down 69ft. on an ironstone lode
2ft. wide and making strong. C. R. Mac-
kenzie, of Cobar, made 22 assays for an
average of 50z., and the recoverable value
of a recent seven-ton parcel at Port Kembla
was well above 3oz. Mackenzie recom-
mends that the mainsliaft be carried down
to 100 ft.. and drives north and south put
in for 100 ft. Kiandra 60 years ago turned
out 150.0000 z. from alluvial, but no reefs of
value were unearthed. The Sutherland
people consider that they are on the mother
lode, and the co. now being formed will
make funds available to pi*ove if they are
right.

Lucknow 7 Gold Mines, N.L., will decide at
its annual meeting to-day whether absorp-
tion by the Melbourne-promoted Lucknow
Amalgamated is desirable. Negotiations
with W. A. .T. Marshall have been afoot
since April, and he went so far as to take up
25,000 of the forfeited shares. An under-
taking to place the whole of the 125,000
contribs. in the proposed Lucknow Amal-
gamated by December 17, however, has missed,
though holders were circularised asking them
to take the contribs. at 3d. down and 3d. on
allotment. Production for the year was nil,
and heavy winter rains and snow flooded and
silted up the tunnel workings. A new main-
shaft sunk to 76ft. proved nothing. The co.
lias been prodding old Lucknow ground in
the belief that the English cos. did not dig
out all the treasure.
A little syndicate of 20 £5O shares is get-
ting together in J. T. Walton’s Sydney
office to test Narrigundah Creek, near Moruya
(N. S. Wales South Coast), as a gold-
dredging proposition. Commonwealth Bank
Governor Denny Miller, his brother Ernest,
and S. Solomons, all dead now, were in a
little syndicate which put a £lOOO dredge
on the show. Operations ceased when the
dam broke away and so many of the prin-
cipals went on their last prospect. A lease
of 25 acres and the dredging plant are now
purchaseable for £250, and 200 acres more
can be acquired for £5O. The poorest sample
taken in a recent testing went 18d. per yd.
The new syndicate proposes to spend £lOO in
testing the areas, and if values are satisfac-
tory it will decide whether to operate the
show itself or pass it over to another co.
From £2OO to £250 is reckoned sufficient to
rebuild the dam and put the dredge into
working order.
W. IJ. Williams, a well-known Charters
Towers mining man, now runs the Brib-
baree (N.S.W.). He has sunk the winze
below the 130 ft. level to 40ft., where 2ft. of
stone in the face is described as “good
quality.” But why not state actual values V
Further work there is held up pending a
connection with Nq. 3 shaft to facilitate
haulage. A whip pole is in commission on
this shaft, the directors having wisely post-
poned installing winding machinery until
the picks prove the show. So far Pitt-street
has not had an innings in this stock.
* * * *
The tributors who decided to give the Big
Ben, Gundagai (N.S.W.), a go when the
syndicate abandoned the show have thrown
in the towel. Mining-engineer E. P. John-
son has had a look, and pronounced it a
hopeless proposition. A few pounds spent
on an independent report would have seen
the end months ago.
The Vimy Ridge (N.S.W.) Board has
been ruffled over a difference of opinion re-
specting the delay in putting in crushing
plant. The manager expected to have steam
up early in November, but transport diffi-
culties delayed the work: the battery site
is on one of the roughest spurs on the South
Coast ranges.
* * t *
The luck of the mining game. A couple
of years ago Charles Kerry had a bore put
down alongside Bartlett’s old show on
Yerranderie silver-lead field (N.S.W.), and
had the rotten luck to tap a pinched zone in
which values were negligible. Later the
area was purchased for a song, and, as the
Silver Peaks, it produced excellent returns.
In seven months £50.000 has been pulled
out of one stope, and results would have
been more glittering if sufficient water had
been available to go ahead at full speed. The
ore-body now being worked is about 15ft.
wide, and one-third of it is high-grade. The
average of the material handled has been
about 120 oz. silver and 34 p.c. lead per ton.
* * * *
With one dredge Adelong Estates
(N.S.AV.) in its latest six months’ cam-
paign netted £3126. Repairs and mainten-
ance cut deeply into gold-winnings: the
dredge is in its tenth year, and the ground
is deep and sticky. In the latest run values
averaged BAd. per yd. and costs 6',d. The
margin was insufficient to give a div. Man-
ager George considers the outlook fairly
bright: with £9200 clear of all debts he can
afford to be cheery.
Westralian Assembly in the last moments
of the session vetoed the monopoly of aban-
doned gold-mining leases given provisionally
to a private syndicate by Mines Minister
Scaddan. The scheme was to cut up the
whole of the State’s goldfields, with the ex-
ception of the Nor’-West, into 33 squares,
and give the syndicate the sole right to
work all or any of the 4000 abandoned
leases. One member declared that there
were 100 battlers seeking gold in his district,
and if the syndicate came on the scene they
would have to get out. Even dryblowing
would be barred.
X- * *
lvalgoorlie mine-workers have appealed to
the Arbitration Court, which recently cut
their wages Is. (id. a shift, for a "goldfields
allowance” of the same amount. In view
of the fact that Government employees, bank
officials and employees of many private firms
on the field arc in receipt of such an allow-
ance, the miners believe that they have a
good case.
Notwithstanding good developments, the
flotation of the Mt. Shenton Co., promoted
in Perth to acquire Jones’s concessions,
proved a tough job. But for a successful
last-moment appeal by director E. P. Mackey
to Jones’s holders to take shares in the new
venture the float would have failed. Mt.
Shenton Co. starts operations with an assur-
ance that a soz. vein is exposed on one
lease, and that ore assaying up to 6oz. is
offering on another.
* * * *
A Perth syndicate with Adelaide connec-
tions has bought the May Queen, at South-
ern Cross, for £4500. A narrow vein of
6oz. quartz was worked for years. A few
hundred tons of average-grade stone would
cover the purchase price, but that tonnage
may not be so easy to find as the buyers
believe.
* * * *
Options have been taken over many of
the best leases on the Mt. Isa field (N.Q.),
and a co. is being formed to work them.
Gouging is still the order of the day, and
high-grade parcels of ore are being taken
out—mostly fi-om depths under 20ft. The
ore is bulking 50oz. silver, from 50 to 70
p.c. lead, and there is practically no zinc
so far. Most of the workings are shallow
trenches along the veins, but on the Silver
Lena a shaft has been put down to 60ft.
and is reported to be on high-grade ore all
the way. The pick of the shows at present
are the Crystal, Mt. Isa, Black Star, Race-
course, Out-on-ller-Own and Rio Grande.
The option-taking co. has secured practically
all of them. Miles Campbell’s original lease
is a good-looking proposition, but the Black
Star runs it very close. Comparing Mt. Isa
with early Broken Hill, the outstanding dif-
ference is that here there are no gossans
worth speaking of, and on available evidence
Isa does not give promise of anything like
the enrichment at water-level.
* * * *
Mt. Coolon (Q.) has just crushed 540 tons
for 6490 z. worth £2474. Tailings took the
total value to £5041, an average of over £9
a ton. The Sydney, a promising show on
the same field, crushed 118 tons for £ll2O,
so values in bulk throughout the lode look
fairly even. Values had proved too erratic for
sampling to give a reliable guide. There are 25-
head of stamps on the field at present, and
the district has been agitating for a State
battery. Mines Minister Alf .Tones visited
the field recently, but would not commit
himself; the latest returns may be the straw
that will induce him to reverse his previous
decision.
* * * *
Brookfield Eclipse, near Brisbane (Q.), is
to get a grant not exceeding £5OO from the
Mines Department to assist it to erect crush-
ing and concentrating plant. Very little
information leaks out about the mine, but
it is certain that payable reserves are still
very small, owing to a falling-off of values
rather than the pinching out of the ore.
Most of the values are in pyritic material.
A start is being made with the plant—a Ross
ore mill and amalgamator, a new type for
Queensland.
* * * *
Blair Athol (Q.) spurted a little during
November with a coal output of 5390 tons.
But the improvement may be only tem-
porary, because the railway contracts are
for the moment going there while Baralaba
is strike-stricken. Nothing is being done
at the big open-cut except keeping the plant
in order.

Ivinta Valley Tin, floated in Sydney in
1916 to take over and work by bucket-dredge
609 acres in Perak (F.M.S.) —the area was
reputed to offer 207 acres containing 14
million yards averaging more than a pound
per yd.—has come to an inglorious end. The
concern was buffeted by the market from
the beginning: a leading broker quoted the
scrip at 2s. below its allotment value of
6s. 6d. before the ink had time to dry on the
allotment cheques. In August, 1916, a first call
of 2s. was made, and 24 years later 6d.
more was demanded, making the contribs.
paid to 9s. Altogether only £16,605, less
£402 allotment money and calls unpaid, was
put up by contribs.; the vendors collared
27,000 £1 fully-paids and £8750 cash, but
they gave original vendors 7000 shares and
£5OOO cash. Owing, to war and other
troubles, the co. did not go ahead with
equipment, and it was finally decided to dis-
pose of the property. After having been
hawked through boom and slump, it is now
passed over to a Singapore concern, Ivinta
Tin Dredging Co.. Ltd., for £lOOO cash and
60.000 dollar shares (= £7OOO face value).
The holders of vendor scrip have sat pat
throughout the proceedings, but now that
secretary Tarleton is preparing the obse-
quies. they have magnanimously agreed not
to press the contributories for the further
calls which would be necessary to effect
liquidation, provided they are presented with
the whole of the 60.000 dollar shares. They
undertake to pay winding-up costs and any
debts. The latter, wholly directors’ fees
and secretary’s salary, amounted to £533 at
October 31. The directors, however, are
pressing for payment of the £402 allotment
money and calls, most of which has been
outstanding seven years.
The monsoonal season is delaying the
equipment of the Bundi, the Malayan Tin
Corp.’s new enterprise in Trenggauu
(F.M.S.). Erection of the dredge is under
way, but the delivery of boilers depends
on weather conditions, and that probably
means waiting until April. Two lots of
boring have been done since W. B. Waring
introduced the area, and averaged values over
the whole valley at 260 z. J. M. White fol-
lowed with check bores averaging 250 z. per
yd., and lately manager Geo. Poole reported
that 10 acres at the head of the. valley aver-
aged 31oz. Poole has also just completed 90
holes in ground ahead of the dredge site for
an average of 260 z. The co. is spending
£4OOO more on dredge improvements, to in-
crease capacity to 110,000 yd. per month
and to build up a fuel reserve. A prospect-
ing license over 2000 acres of adjoining lands
has also been taken out.

“Spare Corp” : “Mowbray” (B. 13/12/’2b)

trench by a German dog; but the Germans
found other and more insidious rises for dogs
than as direct combatants. Animals which
had lost their masters or beep deserted were
driven over towards our lines when Fritz
wanted to find out just where our positions
were. Fritz no doubt watched them care-
fully ; a wagging tail would often tell when

with kind words encouraged a four-footed
derelict to approach its trench, had reason
to regret the folly a few hours later.
“Flicker” : A quaint action was brought in
an Adelaide court lately, when a suburban
barber was sued by the “next friend” of a
five-year-old girl, to whom he had rendered
professional service. It was given in evi-
dence that the kiddie strolled into the saloon
and informed the man with the scissors that
her mother wanted her to have an “Ameri-
can crop.” An amiable old gentleman who
was present —fortunately for the barber-
said, “I can wait, cut the little girl’s hair
first.” Half an hour later a very annoyed
mother dropped in and demanded explana-
tions. She refused to be pacified, declaring
that the child’s hair had been the admira-
tion of the district, “and now look at her!”
Nevertheless, the tonsorial artist defended a
claim for £l9 19s.damages successfully,calling
as a witness the complaisant customer who
had waived his prior rights. The Court held
that there was nothing to make him thing
the child lacked full authority to direct the
sort of shearing she wanted. The barber
also won on a counter-claim for Is., the cost
of the operation—the cropped seraph had
neglected to pay for it. But the next time
anyone below the age of 21 wants a haircut
in that shop he or she will have to produce
a written consent by parents or guardians.
“Tuart”: The fattest man in the A.I.F.
was a politician who never smelt powder.
Being somewhere handy after the Gallipoli
business he manoeuvred himself into the soft-
est job available on the home front, and re-
mained dug in till a post had to be provided
for an influential officer who had been un-
fortunate in France. Then Corpulence was
complimented with promotion and placed on
the retired-list. While in the enjoyment ot
his safe and lucrative command he ordered
a parade of convalescent soldiers about to
return to the miseries of the Somme. It
was a bitter winter morning in 1916, and
the Diggers were feeling as blue as they
looked. All had been wounded, and few had
fully recovered, but Pozieres had been won
and conscription lost, so back they had to
go. Into the presence of these worn and
shivering fighters waddled the comfortable
and prosperous figure of Colonel Corpulence.
“Soldiers,” he wheezed, “it almost breaks my
heart not to be going with you Over There.
It was the Dream of my Life, the highest
ambition of my Career, to lead you against
the enemy.” A tired voice interjected “Kid-
stakes. Fatty!” as the commander paused
for breath. 'Staring in the offenders direc-
tion he was assailed from ether quarters
with a drum-fire of ribald advice to. "Cheese

“Trevdee”: The sale of Monmot Estate,
near Skipton (Vic.), held in Melbourne re-
cently, must have been a record in its way.
Bidding went up to £8 17s. Gd. per acre, with
6000 acres offered. At this price there were
two bidders, the auctioneer and an assistant
having unknowingly taken separate bids. The
reserve price (£9 )was then announced, but:
it didn’t settle things, each competitor being
equally ready to give it—and a bit more. The
argument went on. shilling by shilling, until
£l2 4s. per acre Avas reached —just on

“Uloola’s” story of pluck and a big job:—
The case of the N.S.W. Attorney-General v.
Peters, in connection with the taking over and
completing by the Government of the Burrinjuck
Dam, recalls a bit of unpublished history—the story
of how Lane and Peters got the contract for the
building of the other big N.S.W. dam, Cataract,
in 1907. Up till then the firm had done nothing
big; and when its price proved to be
nearly £40,000 under the next lowest tender (that
of old railway-contractor John Aliearne) it was
not taken seriously. The Cabinet, largely influenced
by Carruthers, believed it would be waste of time
to give the job to practically unknown contractors,
seeing that their price was so far below that of
experienced men who had carried out big works and
might be presumed to know what they were doing.
When the masterful Peters saw what had happened, he
swore a great oath that he would not be beaten.
After going carefully through his calculations and
assuring himself that he had made no error, he got
a mutual friend to introduce him to the late Charlie
Lee, then Minister for Works. He took along his
figures, and so completely convinced Lee of his
ability to do the work for the price that Lee stood
up to the majority of the Ministry and insisted
that Lane and Peters should be given the contract,
threatening that, if the Ministry persisted in doing
as it proposed, he would resign his portfolio, expose
the whole business and demand that fresh tenders

be called, whereupon he would himself tender on
Lane and Peters’ figures, and get that firm to do
the job for him. Lee’s advocacy prevailed, and
Lane and Peters signed up the contract. A
good deal of preliminary work had been done bv
day-labor under O’Sullivan, and all the men on the
job (with the exception of some gangers) were
given a start by the contractors. The Cabinet's
fears for the capability of Lane and Peters were
shared by the workmen on the job, and the majority
of them gave the firm two months at most. One
Falstaffian ganger was the loudest in prophesying
a speedy and disastrous end to the young firm.
But the blocks persisted in staying in, the “dogs,'’
no one was killed, disaster failed to appear, and
finally Falstaff’s cronies, getting in better time
and earning more money than they did under day-
labor, took to reminding him of the things that
should have happened but hadn’t. The dam was
built well within contract time; 15 months after
Lane and Peters commenced work on it the wall
was sufficiently high to impound 500,000,000 gallons
of water. And the profit made by I.ane and Peters
was —well, it was more than the £40,000 by which
their price beat the next lowest tender.

“The Rumpus” : Talk about rotten luck!
A man in Perth suffered tortures because he
could seldom, if ever, get a pair of boots
to fit him. At last he fluked footwear that
gave him great relief and infinite content.
Then lie woke up one morning to find his
house had been burgled, and the thief had
taken a fancy to “the only pair of boots

a few days, and piles of stuff were identified
by various losers, among the lot the irre-
placeable boots. The burglar was committed,
and for nearly two months a disconsolate
man with sore feet pleaded to he allowed to
wear his leather. But the Law required
Exhibit X. However, “Don’t worry, Mr.
Blank,” said one detective, “we have ’em pol-
ished every morning.” And then when he
got his property back the boots had warped
beyond hope for want of use.

From a chemical laboratory:—
One effect of the recent newspaper discussions con-
cerning insulin as a cure for diabetes has been that
many of the quacks, practising medicine illegally
are putting it abroad that they treat patients with
“the new cure for diabetes,” the rest being left to
the victim’s imagination. In many cases the unfor-
tunate sufferers are induced to part with the last
penny that they possess for some utterly useless
potion. One quack lately treated his victim with
doses of ordinary flour, and extracted £3O from
him on the pretence that this was “the new drug
that all the papers are talking about.” The facts
would fully justify a criminal prosecution: but
it is so hard to get a conviction in such cases thac
the Law prefers to go for a surer thing and woi.>

VIRGINIA CIGARETTES
The Famous Red Pacßet,
20 for 1(0
ARDATH TOBACCO CO., LTD., LONDON.
“10-2-4” on the making of litigants:—
It is said that a cannibal never gets over the
longing for human flesh ; and the same applies to liti-
gation where Eastern Europeans in Australia are
concerned. Izzy Levitski, who arrived from Warsaw
20 years ago without so much as the price of
the box of matches with which to set fire to the
heavily-insured business that was already in his
mind’s eye, enters the witness-box for the first
time in a state of awe. The Judge’s robes, the
wigs and gowns of counsel, the abasement of the
court officials have had the effect aimed, at by the
producers of the show. But not for long. Izzy
presently realises that these large, solemn men,
who are brilliant heroes or villains, as the case may
be, to the underworld in which he moved before
he made his fortune, possess wits no sharper than
his own. He finds himself tripping an enemy K.C.
The Court laughs; the very Judge—the godlike
creature who sits up there beneath his canopy—with
difficulty represses a smile. It is an exquisite moment
for Levitsky. He does it again. And now the
reporters are writing busily. His riposte will figure
in the evening papers:
Mr. Blither, K.C.: You have a predilection for
the ladies, I believe, Mr. Levitski?
Mr. Levitski: A pre-watter? (Laughter in court.)
Mr. Blither: A liking—a marked liking?
Mr. Levitski: Not such a liking', perhaps, as vot
you ’ave, Mr. Blidder. (Loud laughter, at once sup-
pressed.)
But it is through his own lawyers that Izzy tastes
real delight. When he calls on the senior partner
A MOST CONVENIENT ARRANGEMENT.
“Do you know, dear boy, I have a suit for every day in the week.”
“Really!”
“Yes.— this is it.”
of Cramp and Pinch, that eminent man disregards
all else to attend to him. At the consultations in
the chambers of Roarer, K.C., he, Levitski, is the
centre of interest. He is encouraged to hold forth
at length; his opinions are deferred to, his jokes
appreciated. How' different from the casual, not to
say insulting, attitude of obscure business men in
liis suburb! Roarer is rot too proud to drink with
him at a famous bar. There is even a lunch! He
begins to speak of Roarer as “Billy” and of Blither
as “Jim.” Blither’s juniors and their instructing
lawyers are likewise friends. Are they not all famous
people together, sharers of the limelight with Mr.
Bruce and Lloyd George and Melba and Nurse Gash-
ford, shortly to be tried on a capital charge for the
third time ?
The ending of the case provides a desolating
anti-climax. Poor Levitski goes back to total
obscurity. Nothing is left him but his unwieldy
banking account. Small wonder that he soon takes
to the law again. There are degenerates who would
be healthy to-day if cocaine or morphia had not been
put in their way, and so it is with Izzy. If I had
my way anyone guilty of giving a wealthy Hebrew
of humble foreign extraction his first taste of that
deadly stimulant known as cause celebre would be
open to a prosecution under the Noxious Drugs Act.
“Whitehall” on a mystery of the war:—
No tears will be shed over Lord Alfred Douglas's
mild sentence for his libels on Winston Churchill.
But, judging by the cabled reports of the trial, the
most inexplicable and damaging feature of his case
against the Admiralty brass-hats was not
allowed to come out. No one was interested in the
proofs that Winston Churchill was honest, for no
sensible person could picture him being dishonest
in the financial sense. On the other hand, thousands
—millions, in fact —would like to hear the answers to
the allegations about the death of Kitchener. The
Admiralty explanation is that the Hampshire was
sunk by a German submarine or mine; Douglas’s
charge was that, owing to Admiralty carelessness,
a time-bomb was put into her before she left on her
last journey. In support he quoted a Sinn Fein
paper as having come out with a report of the loss
of the Hampshire, headed “Kitchener Goes to Hell,”
hours before the disaster occurred. The strangest
features of the business, however, are these: —
1. The destruction of Kitchener at the height of
his prestige would have meant the most splendid
reward at Germany’s disposal for somebody. No
German has claimed any share in it.
2. The Hampshire lies in shallow water. Divers
could quickly settle a damaging legend, which has
persisted for years —that she was blown up from
the inside —by establishing that she was torpedoed,
or what not, from the outside.
3. On this matter of great national concern there
has never been such an inquiry as was automatic
during the war when £lO worth of naval Stores
went astray; or if there was an inquiry, its findings
and the evidence were kept secret.
The British Government, and particularly the Ad-
miralty authorities, are sensitive on this subject.
Only last year a film was censored which dealt with
it. The Churchill-Douglas case afforded an oppor-
tunity for stilling the voice of rumor. It was not
taken. Why ?
“Delver”; The obelisk which is to be
erected to the memory of Hargreaves at
Summer Hill Creek (N.S.W.) is not the
only memorial the Ma State has for her
gold discoverers. In the Surveyor-General’s
Department is a
dusty, old, faded
volume, the sole
relic of the man
who gave the first
official intimation
of the presence of
the yellow metal in
Australia. This
volume was the
field-book of assist-
ant-surveyor James
Mcßrian. One en-
trv under date of
Feb. 15. 3823, tells
of a place on the
Fish River where
the writer “found
numerous particles
of gold in the sand
and in the hills
convenient to the
river.” The metal
was exported from
Australia long be-
fore Hargreaves
gave it a thought;
and as long ago as
3 846 a gold brooch
was manufactured
from the produce
of the Victoria
Gold Mining Co.’s
claim not far from
Adelaide. This co.
had a block of land
measuri n g 347
acres in the vicinity
of Montacute. At
no great distance
another co. pegged
out and worked
reef deposits in
3848 and sent the
specimens of gold
to Eur o p e —the
first after those
Strzelecki had de-
spatched to Berlin
10 years earlier.
But none of it could be called pay-
able gold. The Speck was the first dinkum
gold-marketer, and in 1850 exported dust
to the value of £3920.

“Ex-Dig.”: It was cabled the other day,
apropos of the return to his eountry of an
Italian soldier who had long been given up
for dead, that there are about 250 war
prisoners still in Manchuria, with some
Englishmen amongst them. There may be
some Australians, too. When Britain de-
cided to send an expeditionary force against
the Russian revolutionaries, a number of
Diggers rushed to enlist. Some of them
had been already discharged in England,
and others got their discharges specially for
PULLING THROUGH ALL RIGHT.
“And how is hubby?"
“Oh, he’s busy at the office, I only see him for about an hour
a day."
“Poor old thing! You have my sympathy."
“Oh, it’s all right, deal—the hour soon goes."
the purpose. During the campaign there
were some heavy losses in prisoners, and men
whose A.I.F. record was closed may even now
be working in Manchurian mines. On the
other hand, the “Russian stunt" was used
as a means of gaining discharge in England
by some Diggers who probably wanted to
disappear, and certainly did not go to Rus-
sia. One was recognised in Melbourne a
year ago by a wife he had deserted prior to
liis enlistment. He was traced into the
A.1.F., where his record closed with his dis-
charge for enlistment for Russia; but the
English authorities, had him marked as a
deserter.
“The Deacon”: Scraggs, the battalion
know-all, who was a perfect mine of mis-
information (B. 6/12/’23), reminds me of
old George Bonser, once a neighbor of ours.
Ambling up to the house one evening whilst
mum and the girls were discussing the play
they had last seen, old George caught the
name Ben Hur. “Ben Hur?” lie snorted so
loudly that mum said, “Yes, Mister Bonser,
did you know him?” “Know him!” said
George. “Know him! Why, the cow stuck
me up once at Yerranderie.”
* * * *
“Spangles” vindicates a damsel: —
Into the last train at Central floated a nicely-
dressed girl. Possibly tired from jazzing, she made
herself comfortable and quickly dropped to sleep,
unconscious of the belated reveller opposite with the
crayfish whose claws obtruded from its S. M. Herald.
Suddenly the crustacean-owner glanced out the window
and rose hurriedly. As he passed the sleeping beauty
I heard him stutter “Mind this bird, girly, till 1
come back, hie, and I’ll fetcher a chocksh o’ bocka-
lets.” The girl slept on oblivious of “the bird’’
on her lap. Late theatregoers and supper-eaters
rushed in, took two glances, one at the girl, the
other at “the bird,” and then seated themselves as
far away from her as possible. The Cray’s rightful
proprietor had not returned when the train pulled
out; maybe he was hunting for a “bockalet” shop
that was still open. The faces in the nearly-filled
car were a study; you could read as plainly as : :i
print: “Such a nice, respectable-looking girl, too,
and so young- —and a crayfish!” By the time we
reached Punchbowl all the passengers but a loud
youth, the sleeping beauty and “the bird” had left
the car. As the train pulled up the loud youth tip-
toed out, lifting the Cray en route, and, stowing it
under his coat, fled into the darkness. I write this
to put the girl right with those who sniffed and
to Jet the sozzled chap know what became of his
“bird.”
“Spare Corp.” recalls a Yule:
Christmas 1916 was a horror; but Christmas 19li
was a time when all hands decided to give 16
bovs a treat. Also the boys decided to give them-
selves a treat. The French showed their gratitude
to the defenders of their soil by selling us poultry
at five times pre-war
prices, and old and
scraggy as the birds
were they provided a
welcome change of
diet. The Red Cross
furnished Christmas
puddings and shouted
an extra rum issue.
The divisional C.O.
directed that a dixie
of beer should be served
out at his expense to
every platoon, an d
other officers, right
down to platoon com-
manders, followed his
excellent example with
liquid gifts. It took
us most of the day to
consume all the free
liquor that came our
way; and the regi-
mental canteen did a
brisk business, too.
The night became a
tangle of sentimental
songs, punctuated by
the noise of Christmas
celebrants slipping off
the duckboards and
breaking the ice on
pools of water at the
side of them. It had
faded into a chorus of
stentorian snores and
the half-whispered con-
versation of Diggers
lying in their blankets
in the darkness, when
the C.S.M. felt that it
was his turn to make
a sensation. He came
banging into the hut
with a noise that sug-
gested heavy artillery,
and roared: “Every-
body to sleep with
equipment in batt'e
order, and rifle by his
side ready to move
into the line ! Jerry
is coming over to-
night!’’ “Windbag!”
cried a sleepy, dis-
gusted voice from a
far corner. “He’s
likely to come over! Cripes, don’t old Fritzie have
a Christmas too?”
* * * *
“Cartot” : The G.P.O. is expected to pre-
serve profound secrecy with regard to the
affairs of the public which utilises it, but the
fact remains that the Telephone Department
in both Sydney and Melbourne employs
“listeners in,” whose shorthand notes of con-
versations between subscribers may be needed
in the event of disputes arising about
accounts. In one case not long since the
Department was able to prove by this means
THE POSTPONED MEAL.
THE GREEDY ONE : “What would you like
for breakfast, dear?”
THE SLEEPY ONE : “Lunch."
that a large number of the calls debited to
a city firm were private and not business
conversations. The practice is another one
of the legacies from the regime of W. M.
Hughes. During the war considerations of
public safety may have been held to demand
that the conversations of certain suspected
persons should be tapped, but there is no
atom of justification for it nowadays.
THE SURFER.
[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
The morning, like a carefree boy,
Bangs open wide the doors of sleep
To let a flood of fife and joy
Crash through the silences they keep.
The world with fresh, keen life replete
Has voices that its pleasures shrill ;
And morning’s white, unsullied feet
Are dancing gaily on the sill.
The morning is a carefree boy
With whose delight my heart is fed,
Who comes to me with noisy joy
To chide me, laughing, from my bed.
Then forth we skip o’er shining sands,
To lave in cool, ecstatic seas,
That on the beaches clap their hands,
Delighting in our revelries.
O'er cool, green deeps the big waves curl
With spray crests rainbowed in the sun;
Then break in eddy and in swirl
As shouting up the beach they run.

“Cartot”: One peculiarity of the late
Percy Brunton, known in Sydney as the
Peanut King, was that lie always took the
last minute of the time allowed him in which
to pay his police-court fines. But he always
arrived before the hammer fell, and his punctu-
ality was so well known to the police that
they never opposed

his being given
time to pay.
His electioneering-
experiences were
not confined to
W.A. Some years
ago he contested
Darlinghurst
against Speaker
Danny Levy, whom
he annoyed in-
tensely by his gibes
and jeers. On that
occasion Percy
polled only about 50
votes out of a pos-
sible 20,000. But
that didn’t perturb
him. The adver-
tisement was worth
far more than it
cost him.
“Tid’apa”: Ridden ahead of us to the
west, Jack Taverner, a good, perfervid Aus-
tralian and the very best Agent-General
Victoria ever sent to London. I say this
after having asked help or advice from
Andrew Clarke, Murray Smith, Graham
Berry, Duncan Gillies and Peter Mcßride.
The first time I met Taverner was at a
midnight in the long, ago, when my dad was
sending a parcel of new fl notes by Cobb’s
coach to old William Garden, who kept
the pub at Swan Hill, and was a good cus-
tomer of our bank. Taverner handled the
ribbons attached to four steeds which were
changed every 15 miles. Then, and always
until he died the other day at Doncaster
(Vic.), while opening a branch of the
Primary Producers’ Bank, John Taverner
was a cheery, genial “shrewdy.” He loved
liis native land, and it treated him well in
return.
The death of that one-time lively S. Aus-
tralian journalist, Harry Allerdale Grainger,
leaves only three surviving ex-Agents-
General of that State —Dr. Cockburn
and Fred Young (both in England),
and A. A. Kirkpatrick, M.L.C., of Adelaide.
Kirkpatrick will be 76 on Jan. 4. Grainger
had been living for many years in England.
After 37 years’ missioning in the South
Seas Louis Couppe, D.D., has decided to
wait for the Last Cooee in Australia. When
lit' began his Island job his vicariate con-
sisted mostly of cannibals, malaria, earth-
quakes and alligators; when lie finished it
the other day he left behind him 40 priests
and the same number of lay-brothers and
sisters, besides a community of 70 native
sisters. They look after 150 schools, 18
orphanages, 7 industrial schools, 34 churches
and 25,000 dusky Christians who have given
up making table delicacies of their brethren.
On the material side the Bishop has done much
work also, as thousands of acres of cocoanut
plantations, a fine sawmill and a fleet of
small motor-boats testify. The G.O.M. is
now 73, and is seeing out the rest of the
journey in the Sacred Heart Monastery at
Douglas Park.
“Alastor”: Jimmy Stopford, Queensland’s
Home Sec., while recently visiting the abo.
settlements met Jerry Jerome, the black
pug., well known in the Australian ring a
few’ years back.
Jerry remembered
th e Home Se c.
when the latter was
a Mount Morgan
miner, so he intro-
duced himself and
asked for a “pre-
sint ’longa. Pris-
mas.” A florin
was handed over,
whereupon the abo.
returned to liis
cam j) an d an-
nounced with a de-
lighted grin : “My
word! I bin bite

bin gettem two

TON, Lord Lever-
hulme's under-
study in the
Pacific Islands.
“Spenner”: Penned his last par, F. W.
Sleeman, known to Bulletin readers as
“Azrim” and “Mirza.” One of a Vic.
family which has produced half a dozen
medicoes, Sleeman inherited the hobby of
collecting scholarships, which paved the way
from State school through Wesley College
to the Med. School of Melbourne Uni. He
was in the final year of a successful course
when T.B. delivered the knock-out after a
long tussle.
Old Parliamentary Hand weaves a wreath:
John Taverner, coachdriver, Assembly member,
Minister in three Vic. Governments and Agent-General
for nine years, passed out suddenly the other
day when opening a bank branch at Doncaster, near
Melbourne. Entering Parliament in 1889, it was no
time before he was on the Railway CommitteeI—then 1 —then
a body of 13 men who knew • a few things about
politics. An apt pupil, Taverner could soon beat
the other dozen at their own game. In 1894 he
got into the first Turner Ministry, which lasted
five years and three months. Then he had a rest
for three years in Opposition or in the Ministerial
comer before joining Iceberg Irvine’s Government. He
continued under Bent for a few days, then took the
London job. In politics he made the most of his
opportunities, and besides power and pay managed
to get lots of fun out of it. He played pranks on
fellow members and was a philosophical victim when
they retaliated. Irvine and Ivirton are the only
survivors of the former’s team of 20 years ago.
Both of them were mourners at the funeral. The
childless widow is a sister of the late Tom Luxton,
M.L.C., of Prahran.
The new Rhodes scholar for S. Aus.,
F. L. Thyer, is a State schoolboy from subur-
ban Walkerville. He is just 21, and an
Adelaide graduate in medicine. Tennis and
lacrosse are his games; but he is also a
sound oarsman and rifleshot.
Although they suffered themselves to be
fed at a private dinner by the conservative
National Union at Menzies’, Vic. Premier
Lawson and Education Minister Peacock,
at wine and walnut time, made it clear that
they had not shed any of their Radical prin-
ciples. Peacock boldly declared that any
mark-time policy would be the ruin of
Liberalism. They had to keep the car mov-
ing, however slowly at times, and it would
be a mistake to study only the mechanism
of the brakes, as some of the Conservative-
Liberals desired. And now there is much
speculation as to what report George Fair-
bairn. the chief host, gave his fellow-trustees
of the Arcus regarding this candor.
“The Deacon’’: The new rector of St.
Ignatius’ College, Riverview (N.S.W.), is
William J. Lockington, a Maorilander, who
has twice been Provincial of the Jesuit
Order in Australia, and lately has been in
charge of the S.J. community at Richmond
(Vic.). He is a breezy person—the an-
tithesis of Father Gartlin, whom lie suc-
ceeds. At liis best, when the ecclesiastical
brass-hats are in the majority, Lockington
delights in giving a touch of I’illy Sunday
oratory. As he is quite a young man, as
Jesuits are counted, his appointment will
doubtless be for a limited period.
Prof. G. O. Henderson, who has resigned
the Chair of History at Adelaide after 21
years, started in the Education Department
of N.S.W., went through Sydney and Oxford
’Varsities on scholarships, and after a good
deal of extension lecturing in England, re
turned to Sydney for a year as Acting-Pro-
fessor of History. Then he settled down at
Adelaide, where he had charge of English
literature also till Archibald Strong took it
over. Henderson has for years been chair-
man of the Public Library Committee of
S.A., wrote the standard life of George Grey,
and established the archives department
which is rescuing the early records of S.A.
from oblivion. Health reasons are taking
him to hard outdoor work on a N.S.W. farm.
There is no rush for the job of Vic. Agent-
General, in succession to McWhae, who is to
retire in July, after spending two and a half
years in London. McPherson, Robinson and
Alec Peacock don’t want it. Merritt, M.L.C.,
and Donald Maekinnon are spoken of as
eligible. Mackinnon’s present ornamental
job, Commissioner for Australia in N’York,
was handed to him only for a year and will
end in March, so he could get over to Lon-
don if a bargain with him was struck.
Queensland loses a romantic figure:—
W. R. O. Hill, who died in Brisbane at 79 the
other day, was born in barracks of the 10th Foot
at St. Heller, Jersey, liis father had a commission
in the regiment, and later became Governor of a new
model gaol in ' Clerkenwell, London; and that is
how young Hill had boxing lessons from Tom Sayers,
who was what was termed a bail prisoner for a
period. Reaching Brisbane in 1861, after "a short
spell of jackerooing, he became an officer in the
Native Mounted Police, then Gold Warden, and
finally P.M. He was an all-round athlete, and full
of grit. At Ravenswood once, after getting a revol-
ver from a constable, he was lowered down a shaft
where Mutters, the murderer of a Mrs. Steffans, had
hidden. He collared his prisoner in an underlay at
a depth of 60ft., but on being raised to the top
he nearly collapsed when he found that the revolver
Was empty. Mutters was hanged in Brisbane —-and a
horrible job it was. Hill has published “Forty-five
Years’ Experience in N.Q.,” a volume which, while
not of great literary merit, is a compendium of inter-
esting and startling facts. His brother Cecil, also
an officer of the N.M.P., was killed by blacks in 1805.
“Yacko”: Of course we S. Australians
never had a birthstain, and are proud of it;
still the recurrence of Foundation Day (Dec.
28) recalls that it was while serving a sen-
tence of three years for abducting a school-
girl heiress that Edward Wakefield thought
out that scheme of colonisation on which
8. Aus. was built.
A story of a man who did things:—
A fortnight before Christmas, Macßobertson, the
lollvmaker, sensed the time of goodwill coming, so
he went to his cheque-book and drew £5150 for
distribution among the charities of the six States.
No doubt he could well afford to do it. Forty
years ago he began to make “sweets” in the
parental bathroom; to-day he employs over 2000
hands in premises covering 24 acres, and boxes
about 800 different lines of confectionery. And the
2000-odd are not the whole army that finds employ-
ment through his organising capacity and his belief
in Australian products. The Maize Products Pty.,
the Federal Cask Pty., the Federal Timber Pty. and
other industrial concerns have really sprung from
Macßobertson’s policy of ensuring Australian pro-
duction of all materials required in the working of
the confectionery concern. Also, there are the engi-
neering shops for making the machinery which
makes the chocolate and things. Before the war
the factory at Fitzroy (Melb.) had grown from
the original seed to a fine plant, but it had no
great name for chocolate production. Everybody in
Melbourne knew the firm’s “Milk Kisses,” but nearly
everybody with a high taste in chocolates bought one
imported article or other. Macßobertson, said the
fiction, could not produce a high-class chocolate and
never would. Then came the time when foreign
manufacturers were not allowed to make the goods
for export, and it was up to Macßobertson. Early
in 1916, not being able to get plant from over-
seas, he made his first chocolate machinery on his
own premises, improving on the model of an engine
he had imported years before. His output increas-
ing rapidly, he got a protest from Cadbury’s against
his use of the word “Mexican,” a name he had used'
for 20 years in a small way. He didn’t like the
name himself, and he had thought of “Old Gold.”
So “Old Gold” it was; and soon local prejudice died
in the last ditch. Indeed after the war foreign makers
of chocolate had no compunction about starting
factories in this country. There is no question any
longer about the quality of Australian chocolates;
and at the Empire Exhibition Macßobertson wilt
have a display with which he reckons to witch the
world’s judges.

The northern N.S.W. cow country lost
its most picturesque member of the Devil’s
Brigade when Nat Simmons handed in his
brief recently. Arriving at Lismore half
a century ago, lie had pursued Costs unceas-
ingly there ever since. lie early acquired
much property in the town, and as the cow
capital started to grow and kept on doing
it he never looked back. But he was prac-
tically an invalid for the latter half of his
Psalmist’s span.
A cousin of Lord Roberts died in Maori-
land recently—John A. R. Green sill, of Pic-
ton. Born 83 years ago at Haubowline
Island, Cork, where his father was Commis-
sary Ordnance-officer, he was one of the
very few surviving members of the lotig-
faded-out Provincial Council. He was at
one time Mayor of Picton, and held the
Dominion record of 61 years’ service as
Anglican lay-reader.

steadily; he has to thank Speaker Mason
for giving him his first lift.

Hon. Minister and Whip when Vic. Premier
Lawson got rid of Liberal colleagues to

Windsor Park (N.-W.Q.), whose waggon
wheels had rolled over most of the tracks of
N.-W. Bananaland and the Gulf country be-
fore railways were thought of. His out-
lit was once swept downstream and his
team drowned by a flood in the Leichhardt,
and his young son, who was aboard, just
managed to save himself by grabbing an
overhanging branch. The miners of Croy-
don, as miners will, got up a subscription
and obtained a tidy sum; but when they
went to present the cash old Dave chased
them over the skyline with a gun. lie was
72 at the journey’s end.
“T.R.H.”: Percy Brunton had been rather
more lurid than usual in his address from
the soapbox. “Where do you expect to go
when you die, Percy?” asked a facetious
heckler. “To a place where I can get my
peanuts roasted for nothing,” was the swift
answer.
Died in Dunedin (M.L.) Henry Edward
Williams, aged 80. He was eldest son of
that Edward Marsh Williams (of the clan
which has just celebrated the centenary of
the arrival of its first member in M.L.) who
witnessed the signing of the Treaty of Wai-
tangi. Henry Edward made insurance his
mission in life: he joined the National In-
surance Co. in 1881, and in 1802 became
general manager. It was he who withdrew
his office from San Francisco, where a
few years later other JM.L. insurance cos.
were hit very heavily.

Your graves are far apart;
lor one lies, like a white flower in the grass,
Beneath the cloud and sun of Maorilajnd,
Where, safe as it* the hollow of the hand,
The valley nestles. How the winds that pass
Stir in the pine a Hid shake the kowhaa’s glory
And bring through blossoming trees
Fragrance of manuka and memories
Of Maori lore and hdJf-forgotten story,
With solemn munnurst from the unresting seas!
And one is set up on' a far-off hill- —
So silent now that the great guns .are still,
And flown the Shadow of Fear!
Below, across the river, the • old city
Sleeps in the mist—ah, grey and haunted city!—
Motionless as your heart,
Which will not stir again to pain, again to pity,
My passionate Dear!
And one where Severn widens to the west
And daffodils dance in fields remembered well;
By dreaming tides the Dreamer lies at rest
And will not waken more,
Though from the soft and hazy English blue
The sunshine filters through
The Poet’s church; nor yet when Philomel
Sings to the moon along the silvery shore.
Your graves are far apart;
Yet are you shrined together in my heart.

“Heredot” : Recent pars, about sheep fol-
lowing leaders call to mind an incident in the
Alexandra (Vic.) district some years ago. A
farmer was driving a flock of about 300 mixed ewes
and wethers along a road which skirted the edge
of a cliff, when a young wether in the front, sud-
denly alarmed at something, dashed straight for
the cliff, which was concealed by a growth of low
bushes. Plunging through these bushes he went
over the edge, with the rest following him, and in
a few seconds nearly- all the mob was lying dead
or dying - in the rocks of the gu'ly, 100 ft. below.
The fact that the edge of the cliff could not be
seen by the sheep until they were right on it may
have had something to do with the wholesale suicide
act, but from my experience of sheep I’m convinced
they would have jumped over had it been bare of
bushes and in full view, so long as one took the lead.
* * * *
“Tedicus”: My views on the fox’s cunning
were modified when two young chaps took me out on
a “tapping” excursion. Their method is to find a
likely hollow tree and tap it with an axe. If Rey-
nard is inside he will always peep out of the top
entrance, go back to think for a while, and then as
invariably jump down among the waiting dogs. We
got three this way in the one afternoon.
“Frescott” : Re Barcoo rot (B. 22/11/’23),
I can recommend the following as a cure. Take
three penn’orth of common sulphur and a small
bottleful of white vaseline, and melt them together
over a fire. When blended well stand aside to cool.
A liberal application of this ointment morning and
night will cure “rot” of the most virulent type in
a week.
“Saaedi” : Many small birds are well aware
of the advantage of co-operation in combating com-
mon enemies. Thus you will frequently find the
nests of three or four different species of mirds in
the one tree. I have
found willy-wagtails,
twelve-apostles and
wood-swallows raising
their families among
the branches of a single
small wilga, and com-
bining when necessary
to fight off crows,
goannas, hawks, etc.
The willy-wagtail is a
particularly shrewd
customer in this re-
spect, and his favorite
partner is the peewit,
most warlike of all the
small non-preying
birds. Incidentally, the
oddest example of bird
impudence I ever saw
way a pair of tiny
diamond-sparrows who
had furnished a flat in
a huge shack of sticks
that formed the nest of
a mighty wedge-tailed
eagle. Strangely
enough, the little pair
succeeded i n raising
their family auite
safely. P.S.—T h e
eagle’s progeny didn’t
come to any harm either.
* * * *
“Parama” : Let me endorse “A.W.L’s” re-
marks (B. 29/11/’23) re the jumping powers of the
kingfish. Tile schooner was becalmed about 30
miles south-east of Port Moresby one sweltering hot
day; the “boys” were mostly asleep for’ard, and I
was down in the cabin working the typewriter.
Suddenly a 4ft. Sin. kingfish landed plunk against
the legs of the stool on which I was sitting, sending
me over with a crash and smashing the stool. The
fish, to arrive where it did, must have jumped clear
over the after-rail, over the wheel, and down
through the companionway—a leap of at least 30ft.
—probably more. I have known these piscatorial
acrobats jump right over the vessel on calm nights,
their flight being marked by the gleam of phos-
phorescence against the dark, and the sudden flurry
of “liquid fire” as they plunged into the water
on the other side. These big jumps are generally
attributed to fear —wild attempts to do a shark out
of his dinner.
THE HIGHER MATHEMATICS.
JACKY : “Mine a bonzer job! Work one plurry hour a day.”
ABO. FRIEND: “By cripcs, you too-much lucky.”
JACKY : “My word! The boss he say, ‘Jacky, you start at 6 and knock off at But mine
tinkit long-pfeller one hour.”
“X.Q.Q. Me”: Here’s my candidate for
the axe-swinging championship :
But the oak is marked for falling
That, has stood for a hundred Springs.
Hark! A blow, and a dull sound follows;
A second —he bows his head;
A third—and the wood’s dark hollows
Now know that their king is dead.
Although the author doesn’t take liberties with the
name of this human typhoon, my boodle is on him,
whoever he is.
“Jacky Roo”: The old hands of the dis-
trict have been , growling at me for using a breast-
plate instead of a collar and hames with my sulky
turnout. Summon the Abo. Council to hear my side
of the question. To begin with, the breastplate has
been universally adopted by the Army A.S.C-. and
Artillery brigades—a pretty useful recommendation.
As well as being cheaper than a collar, it can be
adjusted to fit any horse, thereby doing away with
an expensive collar for each prad. Instead of hunt-
ing for a chunk of wire to repair the hame-straps
with, one can hook and unhook the breastplate in a
jiffy. The upkeep is almost negligible, and even if
badly kept it is less likely to gall a horse than
a collar. The old hands reckon that a horse will
pull better with a collar (saying that the strain with
a breastplate catches the windpipe) ; but my sulky
horses get me along all right, and they look a lot
better than the other bloke’s. Perhaps that accounts
for the growl.
“Cropley”: The discussion in the Abo.
Council a little while ago about animals committing
suicide was recalled by a tragic incident on the
Narkunda on her latest voyage to Australia. There
were nine cats aboard —eight Tabbies and one Tom.
When the steamer was in the Red Sea an exception-
ally vociferous concert was given one night, appa-
rently by the whole feline company, and it was con-
tinued well on into the next day. After lunch
Thomas, with the air of one who didn’t give a darn
how the boat went, strolled up on deck and, stretch-
ing himself in the shade, proceeded to sleep. A
little later he was followed by a perky young lady
cat, who immediately started lovemaking a la the
Yankee film vamps. Tom stood it for a few minutes;
then, rising to his feet, he hissed and spat at the
lady, and without the slightest hesitation leaped
over the rail into the sea.
“X2X”: “Billy Brolga’s” remark that
there is prussic acid in a number of different plants
(B. 22/11/’23) recalls that some ordinarily-used
vegetables at times have so high a content of the
deadly stuff that it cannot all be got rid of, even
by prolonged cooking. The yam, which is a staple
article of diet in the Pacific Islands, always has
some hydrocyanic acid about its person. Mostly it
can be volatilised by cooking, but there are many
recorded deaths from it even though the yams hail
been cooked for hours. The natural order Solanacea
seems to be the one in which the greatest amount
of the acid is found, and also that in which it is
most stable, probably because it exists in some un-
known and unisolated combination. Even potatoes,
in certain circumstances, associated mostly with the
way in which they have been stored, can become
quite deadly from this cause, and at least one
instance is known of their having brought about
the death of several people.
NOT ON THE MENU.
MR. POM: “Say, choom, some strawberry!”
JACKY : “ Waratah mine tinKit — tixpen.”
MRS. POM : “Of course, I understand — but,
tell me, how do you cook 'em?”
“D.H.V.” : Three kangaroo-shooters in this
district (Longreach, Q.) started a partnership in
May, 1923. Their whole equipment was eight horses,
three rifles, 400 rounds of ammunition and a tent.
To-day they have a four-cylinder Studebaker and
a bank credit that a squatter would not despise.
Last week they shot for six days and bagged 520
skins. In the eight months they have collected
14,000 skins. If nothing else, this performance speaks
volumes for the .303 rifles they use, and makes still
more puzzling' to me the contention of some that
the .32 is the best weapon for ’roo-shooting.
A PSALM OF BEER AND BEEF.
[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
I have mished at Christian missions where the fervor
of the damned
Almost lifts the roof to Heaven with the force of
Sankey’s hymns ;
With the faith that bursts the mountains I have seen
the brothers crammed,
As they spoke of harps and haloes and assorted
cherubim; »
In the grand Salvation Army I have marched behind
the flag—
I have testified like thunder, filling Satan up with
grief;
But when all is said and done with —and I do not
wish to brag—
The religion of the fluture must remember Beer
and Beef.
Beef the gladsome! Beef the splendid! What a
sight to cut and carve!
Fat and lean —Lord how I love it, heaped up high
upon my plate!
Saints who think that it is pious to irepent and
groan and starve
Never will persuade Australia to adopt their fear-
some gait.
We’re a pagan folk and sinful —we are fond of lots
of food,
And in prayer we’d really rather take a large,
emphatic reef;
But we grow enthusiastic when the drinks are long
and good—
So the gospel of to-morrow must remember Beer
and Beef!
Beer the joyful! Beer the foaming! What a
pleasure to the eye,
When the pewter’s running over with the white,
half-frozen foam !
Who desires a dusty Heaven? Why, if Paradise is
dry,
Every real Australian person would prefer to stop
at home!
While we live we want the wet stuff —want the lager
and the ale,
Want the mead upon the sideboard, as an anti-
dote, in brief;
Nay, Australia cannot cotton to those gospels sad
and pale—
The religion of the future must remember Beer
and Beef!
A DREADFUL THOUGHT.
“Let's take these little chickens away.”
“No, you must not! You have to wait till all the others are out.”
“What an awful idea! Jlow would you have liked to wait till all
YOUR brothers and sisters were hatched?”
These are words to pain some parsons, but, alas, the
words are true —
The Australian is not humble, and that gospel will
not work
Which invites him to be mournful in a sad and
solemn pew —
He would rather start a harem, for at heart he is
a Turk!
Oh, how sad to have to say it, brethren of the shovel-
hat —
Take a tumble to Australia, and turn another leaf;
Give us gospels based on something we can eat, for
Ararat
Can’t compare with a religion that remembers
Beer and Beef!
Off the track and bushed to blazes—that is where
most preachers are.
Hear them bawling of repentance in Australia’s dis-
tant ear.
What’s the good? We’ve yoked our waggon to no
Prohibition star—
He who’d win us to his credo must show reverence
for Beer.
In a climate like Gehenna he cart read the truth
who runs—
Beer is medicine and mighty, with a spell that
brings relief;
Lei the curates stick to soft stuff, and grow amorous
on buns —
Our new gospel of to-morrow must remember
Beer and Beef!
I have mished at Christian missions, been a convert
and the rest,
Taken round the plate on Sundays, and sung miles
of Sankey’s hymns;
But I could not stand their conduct, so I gave their
gospel best —
They’re a female kind of people, full of strange,
unhappy whims.
In the grand Salvation Army I no more support the
flag—
Nay, 1 testify like thunder, filling parsons up with
grief:
I assert the New Religion-—blest K.B. and Star and
Stag!—
The Religion of Australia must remember Beer
and Beef !

“S. Q. Wliyffe” : “J.H.S.” (P,. G/12/’23)
says he is well south of Rockhampton (Q.), and the
starling hasn’t reached his locality yet. Well, the
bird has been at Rocky, itself for about seven years,
though it does not yet boss the country or invade
the houses. Bundaberg Town Council was lately
itched out of its premises by the lousy immigrant.
I am talking of the real English starling, not the
shining starling of N.Q. or the several wood-swallows
which many boys call “starlings.” At times I hear
its note in a fresh place, only to find that the
sound comes from our oriole mocker airing his latest
achievement.
“Pick”: I hasten to warn the Council
not to place too much faith in “Sarah’s” tobacco-
leaf cure for a wound (B. 6/12/'23). I once knew
a Tilba Tilba (N.S.W.) blacksmith who had nico-
rine applied to a bruised thumb by the local Chinese
“doctor.” Ah Fraud declared that the injured mem-
ber would be sound and well inside a week, but at
the end of that, period Vulcan was just beginning
a recovery from severe blood-poisoning, and he had
thenceafter a month of leisure during which to curse
Oriental quacks and their remedies;
NO CHANGE.
“When that horrid boy threw stones at you,
why didn’t you come and tell me, instead
of throwing them bach at him?”
“Tell you! No good you - harin’ a shot,
mother. Why, you couldn’t hit a hay-
stack !”
“Werry” : Many months ago I told a little 1
story in Tiie Bulletin of a man who messed about
with a stick of gelignite in a blacksmith’s forge and
thereby wrecked himself and the scenery ; and some
of the wdse men of the Abo. Council laughed. Well,
there have been two recent accidents at Deer Park
(Vic.) to justify me. Bast January three girls were
killed in a wrapping hut at the factory, just because
one of the girls took a chance. To unscrew a
wing-nut on the cartridging machine she struck the
nut with a spare nozzle, according to the only
survivor, and the result was three deaths. A small
particle of the mixture going through the machine
must have oozed under the nut, and the concussion
caused by the light blow was sufficient to discharge
the particle, which in turn set off the contents of the
machine. East month about 7301 b. of nitro-glyeerine
and gelignite exploded, killing three men and blow-
ing the mixing-hut and machinery into smithereens.
The cause is being sought now, but the theory gener-
ally held is that a truck bearing a load of nitro-
glycerine bumped off the line outside the mixing-
hut, the concussion being sufficient to discharge the
NOTHING BUT PRAISE.
NATIVE OF MEANVILLE (to new clergy) : “Don’t you yet down-
hearted —the people ’ere has nothing but praise for you.”
THE REV. STARVELING : “Yes —every time the collection-box goes
around I notice that.”
nitroglycerine. Trucks, no doubt, have bumped off
rails before without any explosion following; but
you never know what is going to happen when
blasting compounds are handled violently, or treated
in any unusual way. The man who will monkey
with them might at least try taking liberties with
a mule’s heels for a change.
“Billy Brolga”: Catching brumbies by
shooting them in the thick muscle at the back of
the neck, as described by “Jarrah” (B. 22/11/’23),
was a favorite practice with many Bananalanders
40 years ago. It was called “creasing,” owing,
probably, to the gash made across the back of the
neck when the heavy bullets, then mostly in use,
struck a little high. Many beautiful horses were
killed on the spot by bullets going wrong, and
many more died of their wounds after being nursed
for some days. A handsome brumby mare I once
had the pleasure of riding was “scotched” by a
bullet getting her in the nose, the bleeding weaken-
ing her so much that she was easily run down.
That particular snorter eventually became a lady’s
hack, and a good one she made, too.
“Centurion”: Tell Leonard Matters that
mate or gaucho tea (B. 29/11/’23) is not as rare
ia Sydney as he imagines. It used to be on sale
in several stores, and I have a 61b. tin which once
contained mate , the label proclaiming that the stuff
was packed by Crosse and Blackwell. The tin was
i'l this house when I took it over 10 years ago, and
still comes in handy for holding nails. My own
experience of mate goes back to the S’African War
and the gauchos who brought over and looked after
the Argentine remounts and mules. A week spent
remounting a regiment at Newcastle (Natal) gave
me an opportunity of observing these gentry, whose
knife-throwing feats attracted a good deal of notice
from us Australians. As I observed the mute-
drinkers, each man had his own private teapot, and
permitted no one else to use it. The metal spout
from which the tea is drunk projected from the side
of the pot, and, in those we saw, seemed to be a
fixture. No doubt “L.M.’s” removable bombilla is
another variety. My gauchos scorned sugar, drink-
ing, as “L.M.” calls it, mate amargo.
* * * *
“Linklater”: I can give “Yarrum” (B.
22/11/’23) another queer man-animal friendship. An
Atherton (N.Q.) farmer has a young pig that is
constantly at his heels. Fostered by a bitch rearing
a litter of pups, Porky always got. his share of the
teat, and is a dog in all but looks and bark. As
a turkey-hunter he beats the real dogs hollow, and
without any of their fuss. The sucker knows the
gun, and is in high glee on shooting days.
“W.11.K.”: The other day I killed a brown
snake 10ft. Sin. long near the 'Gilbert River (N.Q.),
and I’m wondering if any of the Council have in
their sober moments seen a brown wriggler of the
venomous kind to beat it. I’ve got the skin of my
champion to back up my figures.
“Mag” : A December, 1923, queer accident.
A youth ’roo-shooting 15 miles from Killarney (Q.)
dismounted, laid down his gun, and went for a
drink about 50yds. away. While he was drinking, a
’roo, hopping on the ridge near by, dislodged a stone
and it bounded down and struck the gun, which was
evidently at full cock, as the surprised youth received
a 50 per cent, charge of No. 3 shot, intermingled
with blue-metal, in his anatomy. As a sequel, while
he was riding for medical assistance his horse bolted
through Killarney, and ended up by tossing him.
“Kobbi" : Magpie nests fashioned of wire,
either of the ’possum-snare variety or of a stouter
kind, have of late years been rather commonly noted ;
but the other day i
located a maggie’s nest
made of wire, to which
hud been added a piece
of small-meshed wire-
netting lOin. long and
about 21in. wide. The
bird had slipped the
netting over the pro-
jecting ends of some
of the other bits of
wire, and it flapped
in the breeze like a
light flood-gate. It
could have been no
Saturday-afternoon odd-
job to carry that bit
of meshing to the top
of a fairly high iron-
bark. The number of
pieces used in making
wire nests is consider-
ably less than in the
case of the usual twig
contraptions. Once,
with nothing better to
do, I counted the twigs
in a suburban home of
a magpie that had
been blown down in a
cyclone, and the tally
was 970-odd, with \
number of smaller bits
which presumably had
been broken off in the
fall. The wire edifices
I have inspected have
in all cases not ex-
ceeded 100 wire-
lengths ; but they have
been every bit as rigid
# as the wooden cottages.
“Yoyang” : “Yacka’s” par. on Lt. Joshua
Moore (B. 13/12/’23) and the ’43 drought which
broke him, reminds me of the stories of that greatest
of long bakes—it lasted from 1838 till 1843—told to
me by one of the old hands. The dry spell was
at its worst in ’39, in which year the first bullock
team was driven across the Murrumbidgee, dry-
shod, by old Abe Wade, who did all the carrying for
Hi lev, of Cavan, between Queanbeyan and Yass. For
two years the ’Bidgee ceased to run, and all the
fish were gathered into a few deep holes—a mass of
dead and dying slimy fish that even the abos.
wouldn’t eat. The water in the holes was undrink-
able, and the few settlers and carriers had to sink
boles in the river-bed to get water. The price of
sheep dropped from 30s. to Is. 6d. a head, and
many of the squatters were ruined. Even the
banks tottered, and the Bank of Australia smashed
m 43 and disappeared a few years later. Then the
vet came, and it rained so hard and so long that
it was said if it had rained one day longer “the
fires of Hell would have been put out for good.”
This drought brought to the fore Henry O’Brien,
of Douro, in the Yass district, whose “boiling-down”
methods came just in time to save many squatters
from ruin, for they found that from a sheep worth
only Is. fid. they would get 6s. worth of tallow.
Mordi”: When will a centipede bite? I
have given two a chance, but neither of them was
having any. The first was in my shirt one morn-
ing when I put it on. About half an hour after,
feeling a tickle along the ribs, I started to scratch.
When something squashed I took it to be a cock-
roach, but investigation brought to light a 3in. centi-
pede, the latter part of him crushed. I thought my-
self lucky; but I’ve just had another try. While
sitting reading the other night I felt something
crawling in my boot (elastic sides). I didn’t take
much notice, thinking it an insect of some sort, but
about an hour later, when I took mv boot off, out
dropped a centipede about 3J inches long, slightly
crushed, but very much alive. That satisfied me,
and now I want to know do they ever bite anyone?
“AdeL’ (Gulf of Carpentaria) : “Bar-
coo’s” flock of 52 wild plain turkeys (B. 18/10/’23)
was nothing out of the ordinary. In the far
northern and western plains these birds congre-
gate in thousands in patches of country where their
favorite feed grubs, caterpillars and young grasses
is to be found, generally where rain has fallen
a week or two previously. In hot weather they lie
in among bushes or grass or again group under the
nearest tiee available. “Barcoo’s” turkevs were not
worrying themselves over the dry spell,' but, being-
loath to fly in the heat of mid-day, were much more
concerned at the approach of his car, fearing it to
be an enemy. During the summer months, in mid-
aftei noon, when the birds hide in the grass, you
can easily run a ear over one and secure poultry for
dinner without firing a shot. I have had many a
spill through inadvertently riding over a hidden
turkey, and only a few days ago I was on a colt
when he suddenly swerved and lashed for all his
worth at a fat turkey-cock in the grass. 1 had
roast turkey that evening.

Pantagruel ’; To “Nugget's” blue couch
(B. 18/10/ 23) and ‘’Billy Brolga’s” sweet potato
vines (B. 22/11/'23) I can add another common
bush plant with generally unsuspected poisonous
properties. This is the wild passion-fruit. Last!
July a settler at Struck Oil (C.Q.) lost a mare,
a foal and a gelding through it. Death occurred
a couple of hours after the first symptoms of ill-
ness, and the stomachs, after the beasts had been
opened up, were found to contain nothing but wild
passion-fruit. It is not usual for beasts to eat the
stuff; but in this instance all the grass was dead.
The fruit when ripe is eaten freely by adults and
children, and as far as I know has never poisoned
anyone.
* * * *
“Ita” : Tell “Paul Cupid" (B. 20/1 t/W)
that some tame dogs are just as finicky as the
dingo he mentions, who always disembowels rabbits
and never touches the offal. We have a greyhound
who does exactly the same thing. I don't know
why—l only know he does it.
* * * #
“Centurion”: “Treble Treble,” in support
of the contention (B. 6/12/’23) that it is possible
to shoot with uniform accuracy with a rifle from a
moving horse, cites Dr. Carver, who, while, cantering
round on a pony, used to shatter glass balls thrown
in the air. I first saw this trick done by Buffalo
Bill in a huge tent on the Manchester racecourse
in the late ’eighties. The puzzle to me was what
became of the bullets after they had hit the balls,
for sometimes the latter were well on a level with
the crowded audience when they were smashed.
Later a minor practitioner of fancy shooting told
me that dust-shot was invariably used. Without
saying that Carver or Buffalo Bill used this shot,
I am certain that my particular Wild Wester did.
The great trouble is not the motion of the object
—some U.S.A. shooters now use small-bore rifles
for duck-shooting, on the wing, too—but the motion
imparted to the rifle. Even breathing must be stop-
ped when pulling trigger. Fluke shots from horse-
back are, no doubt, common enough. But that
anyone can consistently hit his target —other than
one of haystack size—from a moving horse I'm
not prepared to believe.

“0.K.”: Blushing newspaper comments
on the supposed origin of our great Australian
adjective (with reference to its advertising value
in Bernard Shaw’s “Pygmalion”) have an air of
being specially adapted to polite society. The
Cover nor-General’s daughter was called upon to
exclaim “No bloody fear! ” which is a truly Austra-
lian departure from the author’s “Not bloody likely,”
in the character of Miss Doolittle; therefore commen-
tators have unanimously adopted the theory that the
popular swear-word must be a corruption of “By
our Lady!” It sounds like an apology for what
the unlearned have commonly accepted as a mere
low-born sanguinary vulgarism. “B’ourLady,” even
in an abbreviated corruption, is an expression that
no lady need be ashamed of using for histrionic pur-
poses. But is there any justification for this in-
genious theory of the word’s origin? “By our
Lady!” smacks of the late Shakspeare’s period, and
in his days the word “bloody” had no bad-language
signification whatever. Shakspeare’s characters used
it in its purest surgical sense, as X may say. The
knighted Andrew Aguecheek spoke of a “bloody
cockscomb,” more than once, as something that had
to be treated With ointment. The adjective that has
THEY NEVER MEET.
POMPOUS GENT. : ‘"The secret of my success,
my boy. is that I never let my left hand
know what my right is doing.”
SMALL BOY: “Gam, yer couldn't!”
achieved great Australian eminence was legitimately
born, in my opinion. If it be a vile perversion of
“By our Lady!’’ why did it not come into vogue
sometime between the late 17th and early 18th cen-
turies, when the old reverent form of polite oath was
already out of date in educated circles, as far as
literature bears evidence? In places that didn’t
move with English times the word retained its
decency far into last century, and it may still be
accepted at its old valuation in remote rural districts,
for all 1 know. My experience goes no further
back than the case of an old Irish car-driver in the
’seventies, who, without any apparent intention of
being too familiar with his British fare, assured
the gintleman that the jaunt to a certain beauty spot
would be “a bloody foine drive.”
THE BOYS’ ROOM.
FOR THE BULLETIN.]
There’s a big skillion room at the back of the store :
It’s unceiled, and the walls are not lined;
No carpet or matting- encumbers the floor,
And the window is void of a blind ;
But still it’s the pleasantest room in the house,.
And you’d think it would burst with the noise
That comes from it often—how father does rouse!
It’s the room that belongs to the boys.
Within it are bridles and stockwhips and gear
That ought to be kept in the shed,
And sometimes a blue-speckled pup will appear
From under a table or bed ;
There’s the skin of a dingo, an eaglehawk’s wi.ng3—
Both pests a keen hunter destroys;
From rafter to rafter a tame ’possum swings
In the room that belongs to the boys.
A packing-case cupboard provided with drawers
Is full of the things boys collert —-
Stamp albums and birds’ eggs and crayfishes’ claws,
Whose value few grown-ups suspect.
A shelf' contains gunwads and powder and shot
And chemical poison decoys,
W’ith a red danger signal placed oyer the lot,
In the room that belongs to the boys.
There are tattered old schoolbooks and many a tale
Of adventure by sea and by land;
A derelict “Boyproof” is hung on a nail
Near the place where the firearms stand ;
There are pliers and wrenches and bolts and the rest
Of the tools a mechanic employs;
There’s a soldering kit and a carpenter’s chest
In the room that belongs to the boys.
It certainly lacks all superfluous frill,
But lucky is he who enjoys
The privilege rare of invading at will
The room that belongs to the boys!

Words cannot adequately describe what men, car and tyres had to contend with in the
great West to East drive across the continent from Fremantle to Sydney by Messrs. J.
Burton and W. Bradley aboard a 30 h.p. Vauxhall car shod with Dunlop Cord Tyres.
An inspection of the illustrations depicted will better convey a slight idea of the
herculean task attempted and accomplished. Then visualise_ great heat, hundreds of
of miles of soft desert loose sand to be negotiated plus many hours of night driving
over roadless and uninhabited country and the fact that less han 12 hours
was spent in sleep in the 2889 miles trip md you will gain a slight idea of
the merit of this wonderful drive. Undoubtedly the brunt of this terrific test fell on
the Dunlop Cord Tyres and only Messrs. Burton and Bradley can realise what they
stood and the remarkable manner in which the 880 x 120 B.E covers (just ordinary stock
tyres, the same as supplied by us to thousands of Australian motorists) answered every
demand made on their strength and dependability. No tyres in the world could have done better and it’s question-
able whether any others as good. They stood the test—just the same as they will withstand any ordeal motorists
in this country put them to. The story of this wonderful drive is epitomised in the new record figures appended.
Fremantle-Adelaide - (1770 miles) in 3 days 15 hrs. 1 min.
(27 hrs. 19 mins, faster than previous record).
Fremantle-Melbourne - (2385 miles) in 5 days 4 hrs. 56 mins.
(30 hrs. 29 mins, faster than previous record).
Fremantle-Sydney - - (2995 miles) in 6 days 13 hrs. 57 mins.
(41 hrs. 24 mins, faster than previous record).

It is worthy of mention that every important Australian
Motor Car Record is held on “ Dunlop 99 Cords. Why?
The reason is—that their outstanding quality, strength, and dependability ensures
their selection, “Dunlops” having proved their superiority and ability to stand
up to the most gruelling of tests. For value and service they have no equal

The Midsummer meeting at Randwick did
not draw a full house on Saturday: the
afternoon saw the stands just comfortably
filled, and the organdies and georgettes had
a chance to swing and billow uncruslied and
unafraid. The liand-embroidered washing
frock had a day out; its cool charm was
ever recurring. Sunshades mostly of the
stubby kind bobbed about like carnival mush-
rooms, and a few tall walking-canes escorted
their owners with a swaggering Beau Brum-
mel effect; one beauty was tipped and
ferruled with ivory, while another reared
a tortoise-shell headpiece. The Sydney girl
has discovered how kind a shade is red, and
the brave tint flew on every breeze. The
Adrian Knox girleen, who was there with
her mother, wore silk the red of a sealing-
wax wafer, and mother’s black frocking en-
hanced the effect. The naval Mrs. Nelson
Clover stuck to black crepe; Mrs. Feakes’s
graceful frocking was the tint of milk
coffee; and Mrs. Colin Stephen’s marocain
was golden as a bride’s dream.
The Ambassadors supplies the luxury its
name suggests, and adds another charm to
the City of the Pacific. The cool beauty of
real bronze and real marble enwraps the
guest on entering; and around the dignified
vestibule the evergreen story of Cinderella
has been modelled by the facile hands of
Eva Benson. The story is broken into six
panels: the first introduces poor little Cin-
derella left at home by her two cruel sis-
ters; the next visions the arrival of the
fairy and the changing of the pumpkin into
a coach; then the drive to the ball, the loss
of the slipper, the finding of its owner, and
last the wedding. The detail work in the
panels is striking, and the general effect
rhythmic. At the foot of the shallow marble
stairs is a Roman court that opens into a
ballroom, rearing Corinthian pillars and
leading by shallow steps to the private sup-
per-rooms that circle the big room. The
central light forms an ellipsis, and through
its shade colored lights merge into one
another with the effect of a sunset glow.
Among the private rooms on the left is a
facsimile of one beloved by Marie Antoi-
nette in the Trianon. Apart from its sheer
beauty, the Ambassadors possesses the last
thing in ventilating plants, specially sprung
floors, and the Havana band that has been
the draw of the Tivoli these last few weeks.
The doors were flung wide for the first
time last Friday in the interests of charity,
Prince Alfred's being the chief beneficiary;
and the wide-eyed flapper drained the mar-
tini that was to put a glow into her even-
ing, and sighed with satisfaction: “It makes
all the other places look like home and
mother!” But to grown-up eyes it looks
like a melting-pot for bushels of the Stewart
Dawson diamonds.
Lady de Chair adheres to the teachings of
Christian Science, and doesn’t care who
knows it. The late Sir Harry Rawson was
an avowed Christian Scientist, too, and you
had a sure sign that he regarded you as a
friend when he presented you with a copy
of Mrs. Eddy’s famous book. Sydney’s own
Mr. Layton has spent a fortnight in the
heart of the De Chair family, and endorses
the common statement as to the guberna-
torial charm.
The social drought breaks on January 24
with the arrival of a Japanese squadron.
Much preparation is being made for its en-
tertainment. Lieut.-Governor Cullen and
his wife will give a garden party at Gov-
ernment House the day of the squadron’s
arrival, there will be a civic reception on
another date, and several well-known people
will spread themselves in hospitality.
The kiddies’ party arranged by clever Mar-
garet Chalmers and Mrs. William Arnott
crocheted a nice gold edge on the Prince
Alfred Appeal. Hundreds of youngsters in
costumes quaint and gay filled the big Exln-
bition Hall near the Central Railway Station.
There was a Christmas tree with a heavy
crop of gifts, a dip of unplumbed depths,
dancing, and a grand march, in which Pier-
rettes and rajahs, powder-puffs and kilted
Scots, gum-nuts and gipsies filed past
two by two, while Owen Cox de-
livered ‘ the judgment of Paris, and
found Colin MacLaurin such a bold
Robin Hood, and Betty Higgins such a
charming Maid Marian, that they plucked
each a prize. A quaintly pretty set of a
gardener and his flowers was arranged by
Mrs. Norman Rowlands.
Over 100 women rallied to the home-again
given to Mrs. Emily Bennett, who has
been away representing the N.S. W. Women s
Reform League at the International Suffrage
League Congress at Rome. The Women s
Reform League has lately changed into the
Women’s League; but Mrs. Bennett found
her old friends seated about waiting to drown
the tea-leaf in Farmer’s lounge. Mrs. Margaret
Dale, in smart black-and-white frocking,
uttered the speech of welcome to the guest
of honor, who was further repatriated with
a bouquet in which the pink of carnations and
the blue of delphiniums mingled happily.
Mrs. Bennett retold* her impressions of the
Eternal City and of the brilliant Congress
opened by the extraordinary Mussolini. • A
thousand women delegates from 43 nations
attended: their callings embraced science,
medicine, art, music and the varied trades
and industries. For the first time in its
history the pavements of Rome echoed to
the tramp of a Woman’s Suffrage procession.
Any diversion being welcome in Italy, the
populace shut up shop. Other traffic stood
still, and mostly didn’t seem at all sorry
for the excuse.
A contrast to the blase diners in the satin-
soft atmosphere of the Ambassadors were
the 400-odd seamen who sat down to a
Christmas dinner at that sailors’ hostelry,
the Rawson Institute. Here about long
tables fragrant with spoils from the gar-
dens of each hostess sat the men who follow
the sea, big Swede and Dane rubbing shoul-
ders with the smaller men of Liverpool and
Glasgow. Blue-eyed lads from Devon, fol-
lowing some seons-old instinct that leads
them thousands of miles after the tang of
the salt; cabin-boy and stoker —these and
the old sailor whose first ship was canvas-
spread come to this Sailors’ Club for the
Christmas feast that never fails. This year
the dinner was spread in the gymnasium,
and such faithful friends of the Institute
as Kathleen Doak, Mrs. Frank Lamb, Miss
Williams and Mrs. Arthur Scrivener were
among the evening’s hostesses; and though
that ministering angel, Margaret Harris,
was unable to be present, her two nieces
took charge of a table for her.
The “Messiah” of the Welsh Choral
Society sustained the musicianly tradition
of this body in all the chorus work, though
it was not so happy in some of the solo
numbers. A crowded Town Hall listened
with enthusiasm to the achievements of con-
ductor E. H. Jones’s forces. The rich notes
of Essie Ackland’s contralto sustained the
Handel music, and soprano Millie Hughes
made a successful first appearance in ora-
torio.
Turn again, Mrs. Gilpin, twice Mayoress
of Sydney! Here’s the little lady who lias
the (in these
days) unusual
privilege of
occupying the
Town Hall re-
ception rooms
for the second
year in suc-
cession. Her
husband goes
about his job
in the quiet-
est of whis-
pers : if ever
he gets head-
lines and lime-
light he
doesn’t seek
them. In the
same way his
lady goes
about her good
works, and
their name is
legion. There
is only one bitter in the sweet of the re-
election. How puzzled will that suave absen-
tee, Mr. Layton, be when he hears that the
social wing of the municipal machine is run-
ning so smoothly that a Mayoress can face
another round of receptions and tea-parties
without his encouraging smile!
There was a very interested housefull at
the Conservatorium on Friday night to hear
Hugh McCrae and Alfred Hill’s “Ship of
Heaven” —a thing of bewitching fancies.
Present: Poets Leon Gellert and Dora Wil-
cox ; artist Cecil Ilartt and his new bride ;
a bunch of young composers, among whom
the aesthetic blue shirt-fr Ont of Ramsay
Pennycuick gleamed like a sapphire; May
Moore, with a gorgeous wrap that held the
colors of a peacock’s tail—in short, all the
clever people this Letter is constantly intro-
ducing you to.
The Casino at Bondi opened with a flour-
ish last Thursday, Premier Fuller’s lady
adding social tonnage by murmuring a grace-
ful send-off to the breeze-swept house of
dancing. Daughter Gwen, in billowy rose
taffetas, supported mother’s white georgetted
form. Toots and Lorn a Pounds passed a
last glad night of freedom before making
“Rockets” scintillate, and Hugh* D. Mcln-
tosh added his smile to the gathering.
Irene Yanbrugli has hung at least one
dream on the pegs of No. 52 that is going to
catch the Sydney woman's fancy in the hot
days ahead.' It’s a frock of striped maize
and white marocain. It slips on like a
coat, and fastens low down at the left side
with one big button, and, for sole trim-
ming, it has narrow bands of finely-tucked
and folded material inset at each side of
the pouched back and encircling the low
waistline.
He is W. A. Thompson on the Education
Department’s files, for officially lie s_ a
teacher in the State schools; but the sick
children in hospital know him as the Story
Man. For years now he has been a regular
purveyor of romance to the youngsters laid
up for repairs in the city's healing houses.
Stories gay and merry are his stock-in-trade,
and all his tales end in the proper way—
“ They lived happy ever after.” For the

His magic has
been known to

only of bore-
dom but of
pain, and to
have so lulled
a sufferer who
had sobbed for . ,
over an hour that the weeping ceased and
the kiddie sat up, all smiles, to hear the end
of the story. Thompson, junior, is respon-
sible for his father’s metamorphosis. When
Daddy was demobbed lie oame back home
to find a small son whose acquaintance lie
had just missed making before he sailed
away. They grew acquainted over a nursery
rhyme, and became fast friends over the
trials and triumphs of Cinderella. Some
months afterwards father came home from
school one night and confided to mother that
to his surprise he had found that <o per cent,
of his class that day hadn’t known the story
of Cinderella. Thompson, junior, added one
remark to the conversation ; it was a musing
“What do you think of that!” Some hours
after, when Thompson, junior, was supposed
to be asleep, his small pyjama-clad form
pushed into the dining-room, his face
flushed with a great discovery. He walked
straight to father. “Why don’t you tell
them the story of Cinderella, daddy? Why
don’t you tell everybody the story of Cin-
derella ; then they’d know it!” And _on
daddy’s soothing “I will, old man, I will,”
a small boy went to sleep happy. And W.
A. Thompson changed overnight into the
Story Man.
There was an absorbing ceremony at
Farmer’s the other afternoon. During the
year the Exhibition Hall has displayed the
results of interesting competitions promoted
by the Firm —embroideries, modelling, doll-
making, drawing, painting, photography; in
short, the major and the minor arts. And
last week there was a monster prize-giving,
when dozens of small girls and boys enjoyed
the sweets of victory. The amazing part
to the grown-up was the wide sweep of the
tentacles of a big city store. These prize-
winners came from the suburbs east and
west and north and south, from mountain
and from country town. Advertising-man-
ager Collins, just returned from older coun-
tries, told the infants (and their guardians)
that nowhere in the world were children so
happy and well looked after as in Australia;
and then there was a special performance of
a radiant Christmas play.
A Claude Parbury dance last week was
small but very swish. It fluttered the veran-
dahs and grounds of Wirrian (the O. E.
Friends’ Edgecliff home, which the Parburys
are renting) into frivolity. Chiffons of
Algiers blue billowed about the blonde
hostess; and melting shades of blue were
also flown by the naval Addison and Feakes
ladies. Mrs. George Vivcrs suggested the
spirit of a mountain cascade in white
georgettes bestrewn with green leaves; and
pretty little Barbara Bowker treated her
good looks to the severity of steel-embossed
black trappings.
Dr. Norman Fenner —he’s the son of the
E. W. Fenners, once of the C.S.R. in Fiji,
and now of Elizabeth Bay—entered the com-
pany of benedicts last week. The lady he
endowed with his practice and his medicine-
chest is Kathleen White, of Woorang
Downs, Moree. The vows were exchanged
at St. Michael’s, Vaucluse —and o.k.’d by
Archgaiters D’Arcy-Irvine.
Douglas, second son of Alfred Milson, of
Kirribilli. was married early last week to
Joyce Fori est. at St. Matthew’s, Manly. The
party was quite a family affair. Two
bridesmaids in yellow taffetas, with browrn
tulle veils binding their locks, followed the
bride's ivory georgettes. Bride’s mother,
Mrs. Forrest, afterwards entertained at the
Pacific.
An interesting visitor passed through Syd-
ney the other day homeward-bound for Mel-
bourne. She is the Baroness Sadoine, a
daughter of well-known Sam MacCulloch.
Since her marriage she has lived mostly in
Pekin, where her husband is attached to one
of the Legations. Her name figures above
stories in many of the English magazines,
and she is now contemplating the publica-
tion of her first novel.
Of course, the story of the handed-on
Christmas present was bound to turn up.
It happened last week at a charity bazaar.
Two well-known matrons who are sisters met
before the fancy stall. The elder, w T ho is
just back from a sea-jaunt, remarked: “Look,
Isabel, those Chinese embroideries are my
gifts!” indicating a corner of the stall.
Isabel looked. “Well.” she replied tartly,
“the cushion-cover isn’t —it was my present
to you last Christmas.” “Why, so it was,
dear,” retorted the unruffled elder; “and, if
you remember, it was my gift to you the
Christmas before!”
The new suburb of Ilarbord has lately
tiptoed into the Manly division of the map
of Sydney, and an effort is being made to
forget that it was ever Freshwater—too
many hectic associations cluster round the
latter word. The little bay with one of the
safest beaches on the coast was originally
“discovered” by a few small parties of simple-
lifers who camped there in their holidays;
they were followed by the usual raffish bands
whose ideals are beer, noise and a defiance
of conventions. So Freshwater became the
first week-end camp-village—packed on holi-
days, empty on working days. Gradually,
however, the solid house pushed out the jazz-
camp; and now—well, it’s Ilarbord.
A Brisbane postscript:—
At the invitation of the Red Cross people, his
Ex. went to the Anzac Hostel at Kangaroo Point to
give the patients their Christmas gifts. Moonlight
and Chinese lanterns adorned the lawn by the river,
and in the open-air ward and lounge were any number
of yellow and white flowers with a backing of
asparagus-fern. Easy-chairs were put out on the
grass for visitors and Digger invalids, and everyone
was comfy. Frank Tozer’s Hawaiian band, Nell
Douglas Graham, Grizel Gibson (the medico’s daugh-
ter), Agnes Finney, Elsie Mclntosh, Jean Trundle,
Mrs. Espie Dods, singer Webb and others had a
hand or voice in the programme. Dr. Melville,
Matron Bell and a whole lot of Red-Crossers, with a
guard of honor made of Detachments 3 and 4, met
Sir Matthew, and the V.A.D.’s spread food and
drinks before the multitude.
His Ex. gave a luncheon party to Betty Wool-
nough and her young man R. Barbour, Archbish. Duhig,
and ,J. Burton from. China; and this he followed up
with a tennis party to Mrs. A. S. Rowe, Margaret
Haymen, Eileen Bell, Marjorie Byram, Alex. Mac-
donald, Lieut. lan Macdonald, R.A.N., J. Haymen
and L’Estrange.
Sir Matt, is going to eat his Christmas dinner with
My«. Lumley Hill at the Grande Hotel, Southport.
The E. J. Watts, of Sydney, are there, too.
Lennons’ was all dressed up for a farewell party to
Mrs. Ted Theodore, who goes with her tall spouse
for a trip to the Cold Country via the U.S.A. A
flattering address was read by Mrs. Lennon, from a
signed and well-bound book made by A. G. Stark,
after which the guest was handed a handsome dress-
ing-case with silver fittings. In Chinese blue mariette
and a large black hat, Mrs. Theodore said “Thank
you” prettily.
J. L. Woolcock and his bonny wife shared the
giving-out of the prizes at the Brisbane Grammar
Schools Speech Day. And a big crowd gathered to
see them do it.
Mrs. Mcßryde and daughter Sheila gave a luncheon
party for bride-to-be Erica McConnell in a color
scheme of pink. As the man in the case is in the
Aussie navy, the centrepiece was a ship.
Mrs. O’Brien, amid balloons and gerberas, gave a
dinner the other day to Eileen McGuiness, who wih
shortly become Mrs. M. Sheehan. Lennons’ was the
scene of the party, and the bride-elect was in mauve
crepe de Chine.
A lunch was given at the National by Eileen's
mother on the same day, with the same motif.
Roses and gladioli, in shades of pink, were the deco-
rations, and the hostess wore a handsome frock of
bronze crepe de Chine and gold.
Capt. and Mrs. Pike staged a tea for Freda Bage
before she left for Melbourne on her way to England.
His Ex., who, if hard work means anything, cer-
tainly deserves a spell, intends taking a trip through
the other States early in the coming year. He
expects to be away from Bananaland for three months.
The Athens Dramatic Co., which was supposed to
have gone to the U.S.A., slipped into Brisbane a
week or so ago without anyone realising it was
here. It gave a number of performances to the
local Greeks, whose name is legion, and then burst
upon the rest of the town in “Oedipus Tyrannus.”
The audience was mostly oyster-merchants and restau-
rant-lceepers, who made the sheen of their shirt-
fronts rival that of their hair and countenance;,
with a few Uni. folks (some of the girl undergrads,
had been worked in to swell the thinking chorus),
journalists and teachers of elocution. The perform-
ance was impressive, though a few lively spirits
had hard work to refrain from calling out “Beaver ’
at each fresh display of face-fungus. Anna Nezer,
as Jocasta, was superb.

Phones[?] Cantrel 1532, 1533,
The year is passing out to the din of
thousands of trumpets, drums and other
nerve-wracking noise-makers, backed by the
laughter or wails of small children, happy
or battered and weary after a day in the
overcrowded city with Daddy Christmas.
This year the red-robed old gent, has his bag
weighed down with playthings which must
surely have been originally consigned to the
Land of Giants. Wretched mothers who
have to drag the pram and kiddies round
all day have had to shoulder an extra bur-
den in the life-size doll and its gondola per-
ambulator, which are too heavy for their
small owners to handle for any length of
time. It is all a sign of unhealthy times.
So many of us don’t ask for comfortable
things. The demand is merely for expensive
filings. And naturally there are plenty to
enter that way.
State Governor Stradbroke, with his
cheery Countess, son George and daughter
Helena, went down to Port Melbourne the
other morning to be let into the secrets of
cake and biscuit manufacture, at Swallow
and Aricll’s. The vice-regal visitors were
shown round by A. J. Fuller, chairman,
0. Russell Gabb and A. Arnold, directors,
and assistant-general-manager C. Derham.
After seeing everything, from the mountains
of raw flour and currants to the finished
articles hot from the ovens, the party was
fortified with tea and factory-made cakes
and biscuits before being wafted off to the
girls’ luncheon-room, where the mid-day fod-
der was being consumed. The visitors were
moved to surprise on hearing the number of
employees who had been with the co. for
from 25 to over 40 years. Both their Exes, ex-
changed much chat with the workers, Lady
Strad. being particularly interested in the
Busy Bee Section under Elsie Holmes.
This hive, after buzzing for our Anzacs dur-
ing the long years of war, still carries on
for any good cause, and lately sent 305 gar-
ments of its own manufacture to help clothe
the ’quake-stricken Jap kiddies.
Keith Rous, of the State vice-regal family,
was kept under observation by a watchful
parent while the pudding circulated in the
Stradbroke midst. A week or two earlier
the 16-year-old had been in Windarra hos-
pital suffering from indications of gastritis
or pains to that effect. It could not have
been -the other popular ’itis, seeing that
Master Keith parted with his appendix years
ago. The patient was X-rayed by way of
clearing up the mystery, and then the Coun-
tess tried the effect of a visit to Mr. Dods’s
exhibition of moths and other alarming in-
sects at the Queen’s Hall. But even that
failed to achieve an immediate cure.
The Orient Co. staged the cheeriest whirl
of the year aboard the Ormonde on Friday
night to the joy of newly-budded damsels
who were done out of their Cup season events
by the strike. The huge liner was impos-
ingly dressed up in electric lights and bunt-
ing, and all five decks were cleared for
action, Vic. manager Arnold Johnson and
tha ship’s popular skipper, Commander
Staunton, welcomed the guests on the main
deck. Bridge tables beckoned the non-
dancers; but most of the elders preferred to
mooch round sociably, seeing people and
things. Supper, which bore pleasing testi-
mony to the efficiency of the ship’s galley,
was eaten in the dining-saloon. The Very
Nicest creamed the gathering, and everyone
was best-frocked. The Orient’s chief-clerk
Paterson, who was there with his wife and
family, was warmly welcomed back from an
English trip following a serious illness; and
more congratulations were hurled at big
Bowes Kelly and his daughter Lyell, who
lately emerged unscathed from a motor col-
lision on the perilous Darling-street curve.
The Best and Mackey dames both brought
bright-eyed daughters. Mrs. Geoff. Syme,
who had just arrived at an llth-hour decision
to make a trip on the boat to join daughter
Mardi and her husband for a brief four
weeks in the Fog, looked like a splash of
moonshine in black and silver. P. and O.
Acting-Manager Percy Alderton convoyed
his wife, who roused a screech of protest by
bobbing her wealth of auburn hair. With
F m was Auntie Isabel Millar, in black and
enviable old lace. The Lauchie Mackiunon
couple took the floor together; the Harry
Emmertons brought each other. Mrs. Gil-
bert Lodge, like a tropical sea-wave in green
eurtainings, was with her sister. The Rus-
sell Clarke pair walked the decks, ,and
Naval-Commander Hyde jazzed with his
good-looking other-half, who is continually
being mistaken for Mamie Watson. Shirley
Bayles and Elizabeth Weigall were rival
belies in early-Victorian frocks of pink glace,
while little Dorothy Langlands Jack smiled
with old-world attractiveness. The Ross
Soden widow, who lias come back from Syd-
ney for a few weeks before boarding the Nal-
dera for England, was with her medical son
and daughter-in-law, the latter silvered like a
pale sunbeam.
The James Barretts’ farewell to the presi-
dent of the Music Society, Mrs. Jimmy
Dyer, was to have been staged under a sum-
mer sun on the lawns, but was washed back
to the house by heavy rain. The hosting
knight and his dame —she in black, with
white lace on the chest region, and a hat
weighted with raven plumes —welcomed the
guests on the library threshold. Mrs. Jimmy
was likewise black-curtained, her silk lacy
hangings billowing under a wide black hat
that sprouted velvet lilies. The trio of
Barrett daughters, all wearing flattery
Spring frocks, helped their parents to keep
the party moving cheerfully. After the tea
I)r. Barrett handed the star guest a silver
strawberry bowl, in the _ name of the Vic-
torian branch of the society.
The Bulletin has a way of locating its
Melbourne offices in buildings that get talked
about. Until three years ago its golden sign
gleamed from the front of the historic Old
Exchange in Collins-street. When the ancient
edifice was bought for the site of the Com-
monwealth Bank, photos of the doomed
structure appeared in some of Melbourne s
queer weeklies with the well-beloved sign of
their contemporary carefully expunged. Jhe
Old Exchange becoming a thing of the past,
the Bulletin home was transferred to the
Empire Building, in Elinders-street, next
door to the Mutual Store, and in that
stucco-fronted rabbit-warren the staff
awaited whatever the future had in store.
The Empire Building was not a nice place
to contemplate in relation to a fire. And
along came the blaze in the early hours ot
last Thursday, when a thousand or so
workers in the numerous factories, ware-
houses and offices of the pile were out or
harm’s way. A few hours later it would
probably have caught nearly the entire popu-
lation like rats in a trap, and only a tew
charred bones might have remained to tell
the tale of where mobs of girls, the Anglers
Club, numerous Ancient Druids, and the de-
voted Bulletin toilers used to go to busi-
ness. The ramshackle building being now
a mere blackened shell, the picturesque burn-
ing whereof caused no damage whatever to
adjoining premises, The Bulletin, with
ashes in its hair, has hied to 154-162 1 lmders-
street, the address of the Herald ere it
shifted to vast new premises, a block higher
up the street. So the world goes on. Vol-
umes of bound Bulletins for 40 yea,rs, many
original drawings and other interesting
possessions perished in the flames.
This Rembrandt photo introduces you to
Marie Bremner, whose fine mezzo is being
trained at the Albert-street Con. _ The Brem-
ners are a musical family, and it is darkly
hinted that
Marie sang
before she
talked. At
one time it
was her in-
ti ent i o n to
start out as a
pianiste and
monologuist;
but three
years ago,
after carrying
off the Melba
s c h o larship,
she foreswore
m o nologuing
to take up
a singing
career. She
got her bap-
tism of lime-
light in the
little opera
launched some
time back by Dame Nellie at a benefit
matinee to swell the soldiers’ memorial
funds. As Belinda in Fritz Hart’s recent
production of “Dido and iEneas” at the
Playhouse, both her voice and her histrionic
ability came in for much favorable com-
ment. Marie, whose home is at Olinda,
on the top of the Dandenong Moun-
tains, is a typical Aussie country girl,
as much at home in the saddle as on
the piano-stool, and an expert with the
tennis-racquet. The young songbird was put
on the right singing-track by Mary Camp-
bell ; after the latter steamed off to Europe
Mrs. Browning continued the good work.
Congratulations are being mixed in with
the Yuletide wishes showered on Ronald
Forbes and the Norman Clappertons’ eldest
girl, Joan, who have just engaged themselves
to each other. But as the is
to trip off to England in March with mother
and sisters, the confetti will not be ordered
in yet awhile. Ronald Forbes, who stands
6ft. 4in. with his boots on, brought from the
war an M.C. on his major’s tunic. He was
not 18 when he went off to interview Fritz,
and during his absence his widowed mother
and younger sister (now Mrs. Frank Stanley
Dobson) kept the crops growing at his farm
near Ballan. There is nothing an English
land-girl could teach Mrs. Forbes and her
daughter about tilling the soil after their
three years’ experience as farmeresses.
The face, smiling out from this picture
belongs to Ted Dyson’s clever little wife,
Dorothy, who has composed songs ever since
she was 14 —in fact, she had barely cel-
ebrated her 16th birthday when her first har-
monic group
was published.
“A Book of
An s t r a lian
Bird Songs,”
launched some
years later, is
her star effort
to date, but
other successes
irom her facile
pen have been
"Billy Khaki,”
“A Bushland
Lullaby” and
"The Mopoke.”
F u r tliermore,
no one can
warble li e r
com positions
more sweetly
than the popu-
lar little
matron herself.
She has a fine
soprano, which was put into the best work-
ing: order by Anne Williams and Dr. Price.
The latter used to predict great things for
her, but Dorothy Boyes, as she was then,
side-tracjked her prospective musical career
when still a student to make Edward Dyson
happy. She is the youngest and the only
member of the Boyes family born in Aus-
tralia, and was the original of that charm-
ing pastel by Christine Asquith-Baker of a
demure little flapper with two golden plaits
framing her dimpling face which hangs in
the Sydney Art Gallery.
Mrs. Sep Miller broadcasted invitations to
the small pals of her eight-year-old son
Damien to come to a Christmas party the
other afternoon. It was a truly gorgeous
affair; but the rain unfeelingly censored the
outdoor bit of the jollo, leaving the merry-
go-round tenantless and Aunt Sally wilting
in the middle of the lawn—save for one
joyous interval when the showers ceased
from showering and the youthful guests
lielter-skeltered to the whirling horses, fear-
ful of losing a precious minute of the fun.
Father Christmas came, with a glittering
tree heavily laden with gifts, and more bits
of joyousness were there for the capturing of
the crowded tea-tables. Eileen Madden
helped her aunt to amuse the kiddies. All
the best babies were present, of course, and a
group of grown-ups who had been asked in
to view the pretty proceedings. Mrs. Pitt
Rivers had her two sons under convoy; Lady
Helena Rous brought brothers George and
Christopher; Mrs. Clive Leonard her trio
of small chicks, and Mrs. Seton Williams
her one ewe lamb.
Little Nellie Kelly is as beautifully dressed
as her predecessor, the O’Brien Girl —Ethel
Moar, who does the dressing, has seen to
that. Mamie Watson stars more alluringly
than ever in a trio of sartorial successes
which fit her appearance and the situation to
a nicety. One full-skirted georgette, blue
as the summer sky, which is hooped with silk
bands and flies a pink rose at the straight-
jacketed waist, is decidedly Watsonish; the
second is a demure little organdie like a
grey mist, with white Puritan collar and
cuffs; and the third, in which she dances at
the stage ball, is all waves of white georgette
crested with crystal. May Beatty has one
dress of gold lace which trails its fragile
length over rosepink; but the greatest
dazzler in her outfit is a filmy creation in
magpie effects, with a side-wash of china blue.
The show girls will provide many a ball-
dress inspiration for admiring flappers in two
distinct styles—the wired hip effect and the
slinky King Tut. The bizarre and the
absurd have been coldly ignored for this
show at least —even the ballet whirls in
delightful harmonies, mostly of the full-
skirted variety.
The crowds are rushing Merric Boyd’s
pottery exhibition in the Athenaeum Hall
and snapping up the choicest pieces. This
year he has lighted on a new glaze sugges-
tive of aluminium, which, however, has a
smack of the kitchen utensil about it. The
truly artistic are casting more appreciative
eyes on the color section of jugs and jars
spread out on hessian-clothed tables. But
Merric does not exhaust his artistic genius
on his potter’s wheel, as two small oddments
of sculpture go to prove —one a beautifully-
modelled plaster head of his small girl ; the
other, glazed in a delicate biscuit tint with
deft touches of old Chinese blue, depicts the
Boyd son and heir squatting on a mound.
Pianist Natalie Dawson staged her “inti-
mate concert” this year in the big drawing-
room at the St. Ivilda Cecil, which had been
artistically dressed in flowers for the affair.
Instead of drinking in the music from the
uncomfortable fastness of rows of cane-bot-
tomed chairs, the guests faced it cosily from
parlor chairs and sofas covered with flowered
chintz. Natalie Dawson’s smile shone out
above a foam of chiffonery, the inky >waves
crested with silver, while a silvery ripple
lapped over the lee-side. The Weedon dame,
in orchid mauve, filled the first armchair.
The music on tap was of an extra-special
vintage, and there was plenty of it, though
not a glut, as supper had been set down as
an epilogue. Natalie contributed a charm-
ing piano solo on the drawing-room grand,
and nine-year-old Gordon Mcßae followed
up with a most praiseworthy stunt. Ger-
trude Healey fiddled soulfully, and further
helped the. above-mentioned pair in a cheery
trio. Norman Bradshaw and George Cow-
ley threw in some more professional weight,
and Marie Trytlmll’s rich soprano was one
of the most joyous things of the evening.
The Alfred Hospital entertainment com-
mittee, headed by Mrs. Barry Thompson,
gladdened the kiddies’ wards with a Christ-
inas party on Friday afternoon. It was one
long thrill for the small patients. The ward
was festooned with Christmas stockings
giddily looped with soaring balloons. Lorna
lteid and Mrs. Russell Jackson’s bevy of
sweet little lavender maidens cheered the
proceedings with some attractive musical
moments, after which Father Christmas
skipped round from cot to cot, delivering
toys from the laden tree. Each child felt
the magic of the red-robed person’s presence
when he handed them exactly the things they
had yearned for. Matron Mann and her
white-capped sisters had seen to that. Christ-
mas cake was handed out before the curtain
rang down on a great day. The James
Angus, Russell Gabb and H. J. Robertson
matrons and Esmee Allen were chief con-
spirators with Mrs. Thompson, and when it
was all over Matron Mann rewarded the
tired workers with tea in her private room.
What a farce, more often than not, is
the presentation of an “interesting souvenir”
to a vice-regal person by a Mayor or similar
somebody on a “historic occasion”! The
Council of Perth received rubicund Lord
Brassey on his first triumphal entry into the
Western capital, as newspapers of the time
would put it. Mayor Alec Forrest marked
the occasion by presenting the Tic. Excel-
lency with a figured jarrah walking-stick.
Attached to it was a golden plate with the
Brassey crest and the Perth municipal coat-
of-arms engraved on it. We know of this
tremendous offering because it was lately pur-
chased by a Melbourne furniture warehouse-
man from a dealer in antiquities at Rye (Eng.),
near the late Lord Brassey’s estate. The
old vice-regal may have preserved the impos-
sible object in a cellar during his lifetime;
but his heirs cleared it out, along with other
rubbish, and the second-hand dealer offered
it for sale along with the wedding presents,
silver trowels and other superfluous belong-
ings that find their way to such places.
Some Adelaide gossip :
Little Mrs. De Castro stayed here long enough
on her way back to England to see the local branch
of the English Union firmly on its feet, with Justice
Angas Parsons as president and an impressive list
of patrons, vice-presidents, committee and the rest.
Half a dozen women go on to the executive, among
them Mayoress Glover and Mrs. Ernest Good.
J. C. Wharton, who died in Sydney recently, in
the misty past married Miss de Reyher, whose
parents came here from Russia in our early days and
were beloved by the present older generation. De
Reyher pere taught music to our grandmothers, and
his second daughter, who inherited his knack ot
handing on knowledge, taught drawing to her own
contemporaries and their children.
There was a Girl Guide party at Government
House the other afternoon, with games on the lawn
and tea, and the presentation of a decoration or
two afterwards. Christmas cards, calendars, a word
of thanks for the work done and many good wishes
were also handed out by Lady Bridges. The move-
ment was rather slow in catching on, but seems
determined to make up for lost time.
We’ve .had a couple of Christmas parties, too —
one at the Cheer-Up Hut with the S’African Soldiers’
Assoc, as hosts, the other at the Jubilee Exhibition
Oval for the children who come under the kindly
wing of the Central and City Missions. Mollie
Matters, Jean Gordon and Janet Gardner were organ-
isers of the latter show, and a wet morning and
depressing forecast added to their troubles by necessi-
tating a last-minute move of the whole affair from
the open air in the Botanic Park to the shelter of
the Exhibition. That, however, didn’t affect the
youngsters, who went from games and tea to a
wild climax of delight in a Christmas tree with a
real Santa Claus.
There was a warm welcome awaiting Dr. J. A.
G. Hamilton, who decided the other day to come back
to his old home from Westralia, where he has been
trying his hand at farming. Time was when he was
one of our most popular medicoes, and though he
has given up doctoring his popularity remains.
Girl Guides on the Murray are the latest to receive
the attention of Lady Bridges, and the indefatigable
State Commissioner recently got back from a two-
days’ trip that took her to Waikerie, Ramco,
Cadell and Morgan. Miss Judge (her Deputy-Com-
missioner) was with her, and an amazing number
of Girl Guides turned out to do her honor at her
halting points.

With Better Tractors .
ď
WITH the end of another year in
sight thousands of Australian far-
mers are hoping and longing for
that new era when better farming will
become a realisation. To the practical
farmer who is ready to seize opportunity
1924 will doubtless bring that mechanical
aid. the CASE Tractor, which means more
power, more timely operation, increased
farming capacity, better results and bigger
profits—in short better farming. Success follows
intelligent use of the CASE Tractor just as surely
as day follows night. It lightens labour, it lessens
worry, it increases efficiency, it . ensures steady,
reliable, tireless power at all times. All the weari-
ness of attending to horse teams is eliminated,
working costs are reduced and better farming gives
greater encouragement because it makes farm life
worth while.
Because of its sound construction and mechanical
excellence the CASE Tractor has proved itself
beyond question adaptable to all kinds of farm
work, dependable under all conditions and always
economical.
Link good resolution to positive action —cease wish-
ing for better farming —take the first step towards
CASE Tractor advantage —now!

PROPELY
Yilliers Stakes day was the usual book-
makers’ benefit. Certainly there was more money
for Mont Clair (B’s), the latest winner of the £l5OO
mile, than there was for Wish Wynne (25's) last
year, or for Sail On (100 to 1) two seasons ago,
but the successes of Wingjen (20’s), Trice (20’s),
V alamita (14’s), Linguist (10’s) and Teremarau
(B’s) were highly profitable to Dynamiteodds. And
he couldn’t have done any harm on Cheerful (3’s)
or El Dorado (7 to 2), for several horses were backed
in each race. Mont Clair, a nice four-year-old, by
Mountain King—Clair, is owned by Hunter White
and trained by R. O’Connor, who has had a lot
of trouble with the chestnut’s feet. He ran a couple
of good races during the A.J.C. Spring meeting, and
was artistically ridden in the Villiers by little
Sullivan, who has been very successful this season.
But Note (20’s) might have beaten him had Brown
waited another half-furlong with his run, instead of
rushing the little mare to the front at the seven-
furlongs post. Wish Wynne, The Epicure and Pop-
away were nearest to the first and second horses, who
had the finish to themselves, the mile being left
behind in lmin. 38sec. Teremarau, withdrawn from
the Villiers, won the High weight Handicap all the
way, and El Dorado’s conquest of Master _ Cagou in
the Holiday Handicap deepened the suspicion that
there is a Sydney Cup in E. J. Watt’s horse provided
he keeps right.
If all goes well with Pteropod he will see a short
price on Saturday in the Carrington Stakes. The
difficulty is to pick anything to beat the Pteropus
gelding, who has Bst. 121 b. Perhaps Otacre (fist.
31b.) will do it, for the handsome Linacre horse can
?arry weight, and his manner of beating Lady Aura at
Randwiclc on Oct. 13 was very impressive. Lady
Eva may be the best tote bet among the lightweights.
Si Dorado is not in Tatter ,all’s Club Cup, which is
a furlong shorter than the big event on Wednesday.
Barosca (7st. 51b.) and Kerryland (7st. 101 b.) look
i likely pair, the former for preference.
*** • *
Up to now it has been mares’ weather in
Melbourne this season, but a burst of heat might
spoil a lot of Standish and Bagot chances that
look good at the moment. All Serene is a case in
point, also Sonora, Switch, Wynette and Bobalight.
A blazing hot January 1, preceded by a spell of rising
temperature, would be "bad for all those dames.
Furthermore, there is young Gungool, who, despite
recent shortcomings, is worth considering for the
Bagot. One is always ready to make excuses and
hope good things for so nice a little mare as
Gungool. Anyway, Bradfield’s best candidate for the
Bagot should be worth a trifle each way. In the
sprint old Blue Cross appears to be more than a
forlorn hope. The 10-year-old has already won the
Standish twice in the course of his honorable career,
and as recently as the first week in December he
won a race down the “straight six.’’ Old Ayrland,
too, is said to have returned to his best form. But
given a guarantee that she was full of health and
hapoiness, this page would prefer All Serene to any
of them.
* * * *
“Wodgil”: Paddy Connolly, defendant in
the libel action brought by Tommy Darcy, the
Westralian jockey, is a tall, sharp-featured Queens-
lander, a bit on the wrong side of 50. He has had
previous experience of this form of litigation: in
1907 he received a shilling damages from Perth
Sunday Times for its animadversions on the running
of his horse Czarovitch, but was deprived of his costs,
which amounted to nearly £lOOO. Australia has no
sounder judge of a horse than this sporting publican,
and he is one of the few owners who have made
racing pay. Between 1904 and 1914 he had an
amazing run of success, winning the Melbourne Oup
with Blue Spec, the Sydney Cup with Dyed Garments
and Lilyveil, the Doncaster with Jolly Beggar, the
Moohee Valley Cup with Blue Spec and May King,
and every important Westralian handicap and w.f.a.
race, including the Derby on three successive occa-
sions and the Perth Cup six times in seven years —
with Blue Spec in 1904, Czarovitch in ’O5, May
King- in ’O6, Post Town in ’O7, Scorcher in ’OB, and
Jolly Beggar in ’lO. Moreover, Jolly Beggar ran a
close second in 1909, and his owner had an interest
(with the late J. O. Peterson) in Artesian, who won
in 1911 and ’l3. This record, for a two-mile handicap
in which there is always a big field, is unequalled
on the Australian turf. Since 1914, chiefly owing to
his poor opinion of jockeys, Connolly has greatly
curtailed his operations, but he never forgets the
W.A. charities when he lias a decent win. Blue
Spec landed his biggest bet, but he would have
profited as much had Jolly Beggar been placed first
instead of second in Relievo’s Newmarket, and there
are thousands who . still maintain that the judge
put. the wrong number on top.
“Country Pod” : Being a minor official of
a little country club, I am convinced that all the
owners and jockeys who race at our meetings are
rooks. There is no sportsmanship about them;
their one aim is to beat the other fellow for his
money, by fair means or foul, mostly foul. Such
tricks as stuffing the nag with a bran mash,
weighing out (and in) right and riding light—cord
breeches are handy to slip lead in and out of the
pockets or belt band when saddling or unsaddling—
taking hold at the turn and hooking the foot or
spur inside the other rider's leg are almost too
common for comment. But for downright roguery
our pony owners are in a class of their own. Beside
the ordinary tricks of the trade, they have various
ways of bluffing the official measurer in order to get
their mounts in under the proper height. If the
measurer makes it an inch over the owner’s declara-
tion that—er —gentleman will jeeringly produce a
life certificate as proof that the height is as he states.
But some of these certificates are not above suspicion,
since 1 have heard of ponies being trained to flinch
under the stick by the persuasion of a red-hot bar, and
of their being weighted with sandbags and semi
starved for about nine days—-the experience, I am
assured by an old “head,” of a pony which, at our
meeting, barely managed to scrape under 14.2, but
which now sports a 14.1 certificate. If there were no
bookmakers such rascalitv would hardly be known.
Still, the mugs who punt at these meetings deserve
all they get.
The betting was 4 to 1 against Belgium
when Siil Godfrey (9st. 941 b.) met Luis Plees (9st.
121 b.) at Sydney Stadium, and the Australian justi-
fied it by leading in every round, tie was never
in danger at any moment, and he gave the £2OOO
“house” a superb exhibition of scientific boxing.
But he couldn’t land a knockout punch on the
foreigner’s granite chin. There was another £2OOO
gate in Melbourne, where Grime, the most improved
boxer in Australia, outpointed Spargo, although his
right fist went out of action in the 11th round.
".Tamwood” : 11. G. Wells once wrote that
the demeanor of the audience at the Countess of
Warwick’s socialist meetings reminded him of a mob
of yokels being addressed by Mrs. Squire. Not less
obsequious are Australian trade-union secretaries when
the great Wren, pony-racecourse proprietor and Labor-
patron, condescends to notice their existence. For
reasons well understood in the boxing world the
supply of professional pugs is running short. Brood-
ing on the situation, “Mr. John Wren, chairman of
Stadiums, Ltd., hit upon the happy notion of sec-
tional labor boxing competitions,” i.e.j tournaments
for tyros engaged in different trades. Blacksmiths,
it seems, ,are to set the thing going (“Darcy, Fitz-
simmons and Godfrey were blacksmiths”) : then
“boilermakers, laborers and other sections will be
catered for, the idea being to have tournaments in
the same trade running simultaneously in Sydney,
RUN DOWN.
SHE : “There must be something very un-
healthy about betting.”
HE: “How's that?”
SHE : “Nearly every man I've met to-day
has told me there’s something wrong
with his system.”
Melbourne and Brisbane.” And “Trades Hall officials
have taken very kindly to the scheme.” 1 submit that
it is no business' of Trades Hall officials to assist in
the conversion of useful tradesmen into unproduc-
tive pugs and hangers-on of Wren. Anyhow, what
chance will these tournament novices have of making
more money in the ring than they can earn at their
trades ? Perhaps 1 per cent, will graduate into the
small class that gets Saturday-night engagements,
which means tnat they may clear from £2OO to
£5OO p.a. for five years, if they last that long.
Another 3 or 4 per cent, may enter the ranks of 10-
round Wednesday boxers and experience the joys of
battling for £7 prizes, with a manager to pay out
of the winner’s or loser’s cut. But the vast
majority, in the process of acquiring twisted noses
and thick ears, won’t qualify for even these paltry
rewards. And if death or permanent disablement
occurs in a contest, the promoter is not legally liable
to the extent of a penny piece. Maybe these grovel-
ling Trades Hall officials will ask Wren how much
compensation (if any) was paid to the dependants of
(1) Jack Johnson, who was frightfully injured at
the Sydney Stadium, and of (2) Jack Dunstan and
(3) Frank Soady, who w'ere punched to death on
successive Saturday nights at the Melbourne and
Brisbane Stadiums respectively. Maybe they won’t.
Against a decent N.S.W. XI the Queens-
landers made quite a creditable showing, but they
got a horrible mauling at Melbourne. Only L.
Oxenham (43) and Rowe (42) shaped confidently
against Gamble (4 for 27), Ransford (2 for 12),
Hartkopf and Liddicut, the side being dismissed
for 162. Then Ponsford and Mayne collared the
Queensland bowling. In six hours they methodically
compiled 4 56, Ponsford’s share being 248 land
Mayne’s 209. It w'as correct but desperately unex-
hilarating cricket, and the crowd frequently barracked
for something brighter. This first-wicket stand is a
long way ahead of anything previously accomplished
in Australia; but the English first-class record ef
554, established by J. T. Brown and Tunnicliffe for
Yorkshire against Derbyshire, still holds.
PONSFORD, the St. Kilda (Vic.) batsman,
who made 429 v. Tasmania and 248
v. Queensland.
Ponsford, who is here sketched by Wells, has
made a great splash in representative cricket. Last
season he got 162 v. the Tasmanians at Launceston
and 429 against them at Melbourne. He also scored
108 v. South Aus. at Adelaide, 62 v. Maclaren’s
Englishmen and 37 and 72 for Vic. v. N.S.W. (the
second Xl’s). He plays with St. Kilda, and in
pennant matches last year amassed 329 runs, averaging
36.65. Nearly every follower of the game in
Victoria discovered his worth before the selectors.
* * * *
“Tren” : Some cricketers are born with a
sense of anticipation that makes difficult catches
easy for them. Thus Braund would sometimes dash
from slip before the ball reached the bftt and
take a chance at fine leg that would be impossible
to slower-witted fieldsmen. Others grab catches by
sheer daring ; for instance, Stan Stephens of Prahran,
like E. M. Grace of old, fields within three yards of
the bat. Others, again, succeed by dint of excep-
tional agility. Two years ago, at Melbourne, Rans-
ford cut a ball behind Gregory at slip, and in
ordinary circumstances, it would have been a safe
four. Gregory, however, threw himself backwards,
and caught it—blind —with a contorted arm. G.
F. Grace once brought off the classic “waiting’’
catch —the most nerve-wracking of them all. Bonnor
got so far under a slow from Alfred Shaw that it
seemed to go straight up into the sky and hang.
G. ran along the boundary and waited, while the
batsmen, with eyes on the ball, completed a leisurely
two. The Englishman held the catch at a distance
that measured 115 yards from the wicket. But
the most surprising effort I remember was South
African Dave Nourse’s long-field catch that disposed
of Whitty in the second Test at Melbourne in 1911.
The hit looked a certain six, but the massive
Nourse thundered along the boundary and, with a
mighty bound, held the ball high in the air in
his enormous left paw. The outcry, first of sur-
prise, then of applause, has .never been excelled by
a cricket crowd anywhere.
* * * *
“S.T.S.”: The Kelleway incident in the
match that N.S.W. won at Adelaide was one of
those unusual cases in which both sides are wrong.
The crowd showed complete lack of judgment in
barracking Kelleway for letting ball_ after ball swing
away to leg without “having a go.” Half the side
had gone cheaply—mostly through hitting in the
aii—and at this point N.S.W. looked like losing to
S.A. for the first time since the war. The wicket
was improving rapidly; care and sticking in were
the obvious requirements. Also, on general prin-
ciples, why should anyone fall into a trap so obvious?
“Off-theory” solely for catches has been tried as
long back as one can remember. T think it was
Armstrong (long ago, at the start of his career)
who first discovered that it is far more difficult to
keep down a bf.’l hit to leg; and very unpopular he
was in England for a time, bowling over after over
with the batsmen standing watching it. For my
part, I always wish a bowler could be penalised
somehow if he obviously and continuously makes no
attempt to carry out the basic principle of the
game, hitting tlie stumps. The waste of time is
his, though the batsman generally gets the blame.
Or the batsman has a go, gets caught, reads in the
paper next morning that he has “fallen into So-and-
So’s trap,” and swears that he will never fall into
it again. Thus everyone who understands the game
was entirely with K elk 1 way; until he took the
not-very-dreadful barracking too seriously, and stood
away and refused to take strike while it lasted.
Then, of course, he was completely in the wrong.
The barracking changed to hooting, and the umpires
had to tell him that they and not he were in control
of the play. .
S.A. Cricket Association lias dug up the
record of the match, exactly half a century back,
with which the Adelaide Oval was formally “opened.”
The sides were British-born and “Colonial”-born,
and the latter won after the small scoring which
was usual in those days. The main interest of the
affair to-day is in the fact that three of the players
are still living—A. R. bungle., of the British team ;
T. R. Bright and Howard Davenport of the other.
“Past Grammar” : Tlie M.L. Rugby Union
team which will tour Britain next year has received
a bit of advertisement nine months ahead, the Scotch
R.U. having refused to arrange matches with it. The
cableman has a siliy yarn that the Scots haven’t
forgiven the All Blacks for getting a £lOOO gate
at Edinburgh in 1905 after they had been refused
a £5OO guarantee, but the trouble really turns on
the question of amateurism. After Caledonia stern
and wild had been defeated, it stigmatised the All
Blacks as professionals because they were each re-
ceiving a “pocket-money” allowance of 3s. a day.
When the Australian Wallabies went across in tire
following’ year, receiving the same allowance, Scotland
refused to meet them and Ireland sided with her.
Then, when the Wallabies came back to Australia and
were persuaded to turn Leaguers, with several honor-
able exceptions, Scotland said “There you are —•
we told you so” ; and it has never since budged from
its position. As far as the letter of the law goes,
the Scots are in the right. The British Rugby Union
has always stood for pure amateurism of the type
which plays a game for its own sake. Its laws
definitel.y state that no player shall receive any con-
sideration other than payment of travelling and
accommodation expenses. Of recent years, N. S.
Wales, Queensland and Maoriland organisations have
passed by-laws permitting players to receive “pocket-
money” allowances, and the Amateur Sporting Federa-
tion has endorsed this, but not the Scots. In this
body’s eyes the Maorilanders have been playing foot-
ball for an i.legal payment for years. However,
when it learns that none of the 1924 All Blacks will
receive an allowance it may withdraw its embargo
on fixtures north of the Tweed.
“Whitehall”: This Scottish refusal to play against
the All Blacks, coming on top of the proposed exclu-
sion of Lawton from the All England XV, probably
dates the beginning 0 f an era which has been threat-
ening ever since the war. I refuse to believe that
a 20-year-old row between Scotland and M.L. is the
real explanation of the present boycott. Even more
ridiculous is the suggestion that Lawton is ineligible
“because he is an Australian-born.” Australians
have been representing England, or English clubs,
for 30 years and more in football, tennis, rowing
and a dozen other sports, including the most localised
of them all —cricket. One reason of the trouble
is that Australians are not nearly so popular as
they were. The evil that a few expeditionary sol-
diers do lives after them, and in course of time is
multiplied exceedingly and placed to the discredit
first of the force and then of the nation. The sense-
less habit some of our newspapers have developed of
jeei’ing at “Pommies” and slandering immigrants has
not passed unnoticed in the U.K., and it is reacting
unpleasantly on Australians in Britain. And then
there is the creed of racial exclusiveness, the tendency
of small sections to compartment themselves, which
supplies such a derisive answer to the other war-
bred religion of Bolshevism. What with one thing
and another the spirit of suavity which distinguished
inter-imperial sport before 1914 is swiftly dying, and
unless it is revivified by generous doses of tolerance,
good temper and good manners all round, the politi-
cal unity of the Empire is likely to be adversely
affected.
“C.P.”: “D.’s” remarks on sport (B.
13/12/’23) reminded mo of my experience as secre-
tary and treasurer of a country football associa-
tion. With two clubs level for the premiership on
matches won, and one ahead on percentages, the
argument started. There were protests, appeals to
the League, rows over the cup, abuse of the secre-
tary, threats of libel by the umpire, assaults on
the same, indiscriminate fights and bad feeling all
round. And the favorite taunt of each win-tie-or-
wrangle mob (they live in two townships six miles
apart) was “Garn; y’ain’t sports.” The basis of
all the trouble was betting. Though there were no
local bookmakers, a sort of market was formed, and
its was nothing to hear of a supporter winning or
losing £l5 on a match. I have no first-hand know-
ledge of city professionalism, but betting is the
bane of country sport.
“Deuce”: Royal tennis (B. 13/12/’23) is
enjoying a mild boom in Melbourne. Wally Marks,
M.H.R., is now honoring it with his patronage, and
is urging the Sydney Automobile Club to put a
court on the roof of the new building which it is
about to erect. There was a big turnout for the
finish of the silver-racquet competition, when Douglas
George beat A. O. Henty by three sets to one. Royal
tennis is more strenuous than the grass game, and it
requires more judgment and skill, but it is essenti-
ally an indoor pastime, and therefore has no appeal
to the majority. Moreover, there is an air of
social exclusiveness about it that prevents it becom-
ing a popular pastime. If by some dreadful mis-
chance a hodman or a cabman got into the club, most
of the other members would resign.
Slip Carr, the Sydney sprinter, who was
only once beaten during his’ European tour, and
then he turned the tables on his conqueror, is on
his way back. ,1 le took a job at Australia House,
intending to train for the next Olympics. British
weather conditions do not suit him, however, so he
is returning to Australia as welfare officer on the
Ormuz, sailing on January 5. If selected for the
Olympic Games —of which there is no doubt, unless
the whole thing is dropped—-he will train out here
and go to Europe with the other members of the
team.
It is a brisk season for overlanding auto-
mobilists. J. L. Burton and W. Bradley have driven
a 30-98 Vauxhall from Fremantle to Sydney (2995
miles) in 6 days' 13hr. 57min., lopping 1 day 17hr.
24min. off the record ; and a 10-h.p. Citroen has
sped between Melbourne and Sydney in 15hr. 20min. —
new figures for light cars. And had proper atten-
tion been given to long sections of alleged road,
faster times would have been made in both cases.

“It is a usual thing for jockeys to ask each other
at the barrier, ‘Are you “crook'’ to-day V Saddle-
sitter's statement in the witness-box.
The punters blither of “form” and “class”
And gallops fast and slow,
But ever and aye, as the lean years pass,
They more insolvent grow.
For “class” has little to do with it,
And “form” is merely a snare
’Gainst the strong right arm and mother wit
Of the dwarf who sits up there.
Fantastic sums of money are boned
And piled upon tall, lean steeds.
For several weeks Hope sits enthroned
In the authors of such deeds:
They’re buoyed with thoughts of approaching wealth,
But lean on a rotten prop,
Whose strength is what has been passed by stealth
To the vengl lad “on top.”
The fav’rite’s owner distributes tips;
The trainer expresses hopes ;
The breeder talks about hocks or hips;
The vet. of the latest dopes;
But all an amazing heedlessness
On the crucial subject show
Of yon wizened moron in fancy dress,
And whether he’s “crook” or no.
Avoid the racecourse, my punting friend —
Or anyhow the ring.
All efforts made to defeat it end
In bankruptcy’s sharp sting.
Desist from skiting of “bosker spins’?
And “the oil about dinkurn goes,”
For only the bookie always wins,
And only the jockey knows.

THE IDEAL GIFT. AT ALL FIRST-CLASS
TOBACCO STORES.
Inquiries invited to Box 171 G»P.O., Sydney.
“Machete”: “Professor X,” writing from
Japan (B. 6/12/’23), told of the butchery
of a leading Japanese socialist, with his
wife and child, by a Japanese officer named
Amakasu. The cables now announce that
this individual, with others, has been court-
martialled and sentenced to death for the
murders, as well as for the wiping out, in
similar fashion, of a party of Koreans.
“Adamascus”: The Salvos in Queensland
are adopting a new method of reaching the
far Outback. Two officers in a caravan
move all over the country distributing litera-
ture, holding services where possible, marry-
ing, christening, burying, doing everything
that ministers of the gospel can do in the
Outback. They are called the Salvation
Army Bush Crusaders, and they confii'm my
belief that the Salvos are still the ringers
on the practical side of Christianity.
“T.R.H.”: As I entered N.S.W. Parlia-
ment House yesterday for the first time. 1
thought I must be going into a third-class
hotel. On the floor was shabby oil-
cloth, which did not look as if it had been
scrubbed for a month. A policeman at the
door was laughing and joking with a “cob-
ber,” and members lounged about smoking
cigars. It only wanted the smell of stale
beer, and the surroundings of a “three-bob-
bed-and-breakfast” pub would all have been
there. To a stranger the only striking
feature of this Parliament House is its utter
lack of dignity.
“Harold Hardupp”: With all the fight
knocked out of it in the 1937 strike, the
Sydney Wharfios’ Union saw preference of
employment pass to a bureau dominated by
the “loyalists” who had helped to beat the true
blues. For a long time the union got only the
crumbs that fell from the rich bureau's
table. But when the war-drums throbbed
no longer, many Diggers rejoined the old
union, which has been steadily consolidating
its position. Now the Arbitration Court
has restored its pre-war preference, subject
to the statutory preference to ex-soldiers.
Of all the unions concerned in the mad 1917
business none suffered more bitterly than the
Wliarfies, and evidently the Court's view is
that they have gone through fires enough.
“The Rumpus” : After the first scare of
the rinderpest outbreak in the Fremantle dis-
trict in Westralia, fears subsided a little
until the disease made its appearance at
Belmont, some 20 miles from its starting-
point. Since then a 30-mile land-radius
quarantine, which includes Perth, has been
proclaimed, and all cattle, sheep, goats, pigs
and dogs come under restriction. No cattle
fodder of any sort may go out of this area
without a permit, and no vegetables or
second-hand produce-bags containing goods.
The most amazing theory yet broached about
the origin of the disease is that a plague
of snails, “come up from the sea,” invaded
the grassy areas, leaving quantities of slime
in their wake, which slime was absorbed by
the cattle. A much more feasible solution
is our importing habit. I suspect maize.
“Santander”: The effort of Vic. Railway
Commissioner Clapp to make a little extra
out of advts. in his trains seems doomed to
offend the sensibilities of people who are
blind to outrages in other directions. Thus
one of the loudest critics of Clapp’s proposal
is a councillor of a suburb conspicuous for
shoddy houses and dishevelled streets. Just
as inconsistently a great journal, which
points scornfully to the liquor posters on
some of Clapp’s bridges, allows an advertiser
to stand on top of its leading article and shout
the virtues of his beer. These aesthetic purists’
search for eyesores never begins at home.
And their aesthetic shudders are nearly
always felt along the optic nerve. The per-
son who feels the need of burnt feathers
on sighting a study of a baby bursting
through feeding on Bodger’s Bosker Biscuits
will listen to a jazz band without a protest.
If only their noses and ears were as suscep-
tible to insult as their eyes, they might com-
bine to make Melbourne quite a decent place
to live in.
“Hanno”: Country lodge doctors and
chemists—the latter particularly—carry
things even further than “Country Med.” sug-
gests (B. 29/11/’23). There are chemists
dispensing for lodges who make a practice
of putting in only two-thirds or half the
quantities of drugs prescribed; and an ex-
pensive ingredient may be left out altogether,
especially when its omission makes no differ-
ence in the taste or color of the mixture.
When the dispensing is on a large scale the
cheapest kind of drugs and preparations are
used at all times; an added economy is re-
presented by the delivery of mixtures in
sauce-bottles and ointments and powders in
tobacco-tins. This tinkering with prescrip-
tions is obviously unfair to the doctor, and
a worse fraud on fhe patient. The source
of the trouble is mostly cut rates. The
lodges make their payments for dispensing
in a lump sum, often for six months or a
year at a time, and the lure of £lOO or so
in cash will tempt the struggling country
chemist to tender for the dispensing at a
rate which will not return him a fair profit
or a profit at all if he makes up prescrip-
tions faithfully. Lodges are children playing
witli fire when they set. out to save pence on
their medical benefits.
“Coot”: The granting of a liquor license
to the Federal Coffee Palace, in Collins-
street, Melbourne, must have produced a
commotion in the graves of the two Jimmies,
Munro and Mirams. The great building
was erected by Cold Tea in the boom years.
Munro being chairman of directors and
Mirams secretary. Over the main entrance
doors was a plaster cast of Mirams’s head.
When the energetic little man was used as
a scapegoat and sent to prison in
connection with the Premier Permanent
Building Society’s affairs, the head was
hastily scraped off—which really was
an ungracious thing for Cold Tea to do;
for it is pretty certain that if Little .Timmy
had been a flash champagne guzzler he
wouldn’t have been specially selected for
attack. For many years the old brigade has
fought strenuously and successfully to pre-
vent a license, being granted, but at last the
inevitable has happened. C. Smith, manager
for many years, pursues evangelistic work
on Princes’ Bridge as a hobby in his spare
time, and immediately the Court granted a
license he resigned liis managership, while
shareholders from the ancient days threw
their shares on the market for What they
would fetch —or thereabouts.

Pinero’s “His House in Order” dates as
far back as 1906, but the Vanbrugh-Bouci-
cault combination presented it at Sydney
Cri. on Saturday night with so much spirit
and freshness and sympathy that a first-night
audience was fairly carried off its feet. In
the role of Nina Irene Vanbrugh swept
the gamut of feminine emotions, and
played on her audience, sometimes stormily,
more often with quiet intensity, but
always effectively. Dion Boucicault found
equally fine scope for his talents in
the part of Hilary Jesson; it would be hard
to conceive a more vivid, clear-cut picture of
a character, into which the playwright has
thrown much that is complex, and which yet
remains essentially human. The minor
parts were handled deftly by Lena Halliday,
Ethel Wellesley, Reg Wykeham and Henry
Latimer. At the close, in response to re-
peated calls, Mr. Boucicault intimated that
lie didn’t milcli believe in post-play speech-
making, adding that it was an innovation
since he was last in Sydney, but he packed
a deal of relevance into a very few sentences.
This, among other things, that his greatest
triumph was in marrying Miss Vanbrugh.
Under the flag of that bold buccaneer,
Captain Patrick O’Gorman, the good ship
Albatross sailed the Spanish Main on Satur-
day, and the result should be, as the weeks
go on, a chest or so of gold doubloons for the
box-office at the Sydney Royal. The play
is a swashbuckling story of adventure: it
would be pure melodrama or pantomime but
for one thing—there is no comedian, unless
Mason Wood’s Chinaman is one; probably
a Celestial in the audience would laugh im-
moderately over that. Though it has no-
thing of the whimsical charm of Captain
Applejohn, the play sweeps along, all canvas
spread, merrily enough. The story opens

in the wineshop kept by the widow (Jessie
Page) of Tomaso Talavera, a once redoubt-
able pirate known as the Devilfish. To this
old virago (one of the best bits of work in
the cast) comes Pedro Malorix (Anew
McMaster), pleasingly sub-titled the Vul-
ture, to plot how to wring from Juanita,
the Devilfish’s beautiful daughter (Doris
Champion), the key to the island on the
Spanish Main in which Tomaso lias buried
his treasure. Now, Juanita, in the impetu-
ous southern cash-and-carry manner, has
given her heart to a man she’d met the day
before—Oscar Patrick O’Gorman Asche,
treasure-seeker, the man who couldn’t tell
a lie because he’d kissed the blarney-stone.
How the Vulture steals the Captain’s ship
and makes the Captain work it, and how
the clever Patrick and his broths of boys
turn the tables completely is a story threaded
together on a chain whose links are drugged
wines, cutlasses, kegs of powder, a beauteous
lady, a treasure island, a skeleton and a ghost.
As tlio dashing Captain, Oscar Asclie
moves with a lightness and talks with a
blitheness amazing to the eye and stirring
to the fancy. Doris Champion as Juanita
left one cold, both acting and voice being
too shrill; Anew McMaster, as Pedro, had
his moments of impressiveness; the rest of
the crew and cut-throats aboard the Alba-
tross were about as good and as bad as
the author meant them to be. For scenic
artists Leslie Board, W. Little and G. Dixon
there can be nothing but praise: with a few
strips of canvas they'd make any girl be-
lieve she was dwelling in marble halls when
any reputable quantity surveyor would de-
scribe the premises as a one-room wattle

When Lorna and Toots Pounds were last
in Sydney they were precocious music-hall
performers whose turn (faintly remembered
and never very thrilling) began with
“Ladies —• and gentlemen —■ with —your—
kind —attention —I—will—now—give—you—
an —imitation —of—Miss—Sadie—Mulatter—
singing—‘Lynching-time—in—Dixie.’ ” The
average child-mimic of vaudeville soon fades
into obscurity, but the Pounds sisters w r ere
made of more wearable stuff. Having
studied hard in London and endured much,
they have come back accomplished revue
actresses, with agreeable voices, educated
feet and ingratiating ways. Lorna, the
elder girl, is evidently the brains of the
partnership, and some of her work in
“Rockets,” at the Ward-Fuller Opera House,
suggests that if ever she tires of vaudeville,
revue and “revusical pantomime,” whatever
that may be, there is a future for her in
straight comedy. Toots has a wistful pret-
tiness, and her nice little soprano is very
effective in light numbers, though a bit over-
burdened in the grand-opera selections intro-
duced in the tenth of the 16 acts or
“rockets.” Which remark also applies to
the otherwise useful tenor of Arthur Lucas.
For the rest, there are Charles Austin, an
English comedian who ■ presents Cockney
types very cleverly, but who, like the other
principals, has too much to do (most of the
revues seen in Australia have had this
defect) : and Wee Georgie Harris, who
would “go bigger” if the public hadn’t taken
to its heart another Wee Georgie, and win-
some Ivy Moore, long Ddn Stuart, stout and
smiling John Kirby and Connie Milne. Also,
stunning spectacles are produced by various
happy combinations of scenery, lights and
costumed Girl; and the management provides
any amount of food for thought as to whether
stage legs look more alluring in tights or
the natural state.

Hugh McCrae and Alfred Hill’s “Ship of
Heaven” set sail for the first time in the
small hall of the Sydney Conservatorium
last Friday night. The collaboration is
called a musical fantasy. It abounds in
whimsical impossibilities, such as happen in
a dream, and nobody is surprised at a ship
being anchored in a garden of flowers; a
tree that sprouts a telephone; a mushroom
seating Columbine that grows and grows till
it disappears in the heavens; a garden path
that gets up and demands payment .for
being walked upon ; a procession of stained-
glass windows, and a skipper who reads by
the aid of a telescope. Hugh expounded the
fabulous plot, and then Alfred went to the
piano, and with the help of singers Mrs.
Goossens-Viceroy, McKinley and Harold
Tollernache ran through the big numbers of
the work. Both poet and composer have
done their best work in the pierrot lyrics,
which are full of engaging fancies. The
small hall was breathless with humans, musi-
cal, poetic and artistic.
Little Red Riding Hood in her gay cloak
came to Fuller’s New Theatre in Sydney on
Saturday afternoon. With her she brought
Sweetheart Boy Blue (good-looking Marie
la Varre). her Mother Dolly Dimples (Dame
Jim Gerald), the family dog (Billy le
Brun) and brother Willie (Lance Vane).
Mother is a hospitable old lady who keeps
open house for all and sun- (or throat-) dry,
including Lord Helpus, her fiasco. There are
merry goings-on, even while poor little Red
Riding Hood is facing tlie fearsome wolf in
the wood. Of course Boy Blue rescues her;
and then the family and the family friends
rush to Rainbow Land and Treasure Island
in search of the Porcelain Palace which is
Red Riding Hood’s inheritance. The dancing
is pretty, the singing sweet if somewhat
anaemic except for the numbers of King
Wolf (Howard Hall). Jim Gerald and
Lord Helpus supply round after round of
fun. though a few cuts in their baby-bonus
witticisms would never be missed; Billy le
Bran’s dog is the kind of animal that should
be encouraged; and Rene Barlee’s Red
Riding Hood is a winsome lass.
“A Southern Maid” continues to be melo-
dious and magnetic at Her Majesty’s, Syd-
ney. Also gay and romantic and alluring.
For breaking and entering Sydney Hip-
podrome “The Forty Thieves” (there
are really only thirty of them, all,
shocking to have to admit, women)
have been sentenced to appear there
twice daily in a phantasmagoria of colorful
dances. The robber band is aided and
abetted by a big importation from the Tivoli
circuit —the panto, being a Musgrove-J.C.W.
conspiracy—with a basket-full of starfish
trawled from all over the Commonwealth.
The panto. itself is a medley of
clean, wholesome foolery and restful,
harmonious scenes; and the wardrobe
mistress has earned her salary three

times over. The songs are sung some of
them sparkingly, others moderately well;
but few of them are worth singing even in
the bath. The dancing hasn’t much novelty
either. Of the artists the principal boy,
Kitty Reidy, doesn’t swashbuckle like most
p.b’s; her charm is in a feminine piquancy
and a sweet voice. Dorothy Rudder, the
principal girl, relies more upon a passable
warble than a stage presence; Bert Harrow
is a convivial Dame, who works off a lot
of his old Tivoli stuff; .Tack Cannot is
a hearty Ali Baba, with a good baritone
reinforcement; J. B. AtholWood presents a
really striking study of the miserly Cassini
Baba; and minor roles are filled by Millie
Darris, Vera Benson, Harry Dale, Dan
Niblo and Mollie Fisher, who secures the
first preference of the gods as Min in the
Ginger Meggs scene. A show that is easy
to endure, designed for the kiddies rather than
for the adults, and one that will be better
after the lawn-mower has been run over it.
The Sydney Tiv. is held up by four strong
columns at the moment, and it needs them
to carry the crowds that are flocking through
its turnstile. The first three, Robt. Wilton,
Long Tack Sam and Carvet and Verena, are
well-established pillars, so much so that they
scorn to trot any new tricks out of the bag.
The fourth is a newcomer, Miss Florence
Yaymen, a versatile Englishwoman, who
appears in a series of smart and difficult
impersonations. Cake is still being passed
around by Wolf and Magley, and the gallery
is cheering the bulky June Mills to greater
efforts of panting ludicrousness.
“Little Nellie Kelly,” at Melbourne Prin-
cess’s, is much the same sort of undertaking
as its predecessor, “The O’Brien Girl,” and is
played with an even more expensive glitter of
purple and fine women. It is frankly an-
other Cinderella story of artless beauty
courted by unbounded wealth; but in the
present cast Mamie Watson prefers the
mere young man she does love to the mag-
nanimous millionaire she doesn’t. Fortu-
nately Mamie is the super-shopgirl, who pro-
fits by the patronage of May Beatty and be-
comes sole mistress of the comic-opera
drapery establishment where a giddy chorus
is supposed to earn its crust. Ireland Cutter
plays the part of pet goat in attendance on
June Roberts, who forgives him for being a
tame Angora, while Mark Daly is a genial
New York policeman engaged in putting
down all the accursed drink he can swallow.
Mel Ward, disguised as a dancing detective,
has something to say which will go for much
more as he acquires ease and confidence in
saying it. Perhaps the one well-remembered
member of the old co. who now cuts more
ice than before is Leyland Hodgson as the
humble admirer who captures Mamie Wat-
son in the end. Hodgson is a variety of
Sentimental Bloke, and when he sings of love
his unrefined melody makes a commonplace
appeal to commonplace sentimentality.
The particular strength of Hugh Ward's
beauteous show is in its rich color, its
vivacity and its wealth of clever dancing,
especially the joyous chief solo of June
Roberts and the picturesque apacheonnata
duet of Hazel Harris and Wesley Pierce.
Jude Roberts’s poetic lissomeness of limb
and grace of gesture are a joy. The parti-
cular weakness of the co. is an uninteresting
principal baritone, who makes Mamie Wat-
son’s contempt for wealth seem almost com-
prehensible. Despite her costly outfit, a
cheap pretence of melodramatic plot radiat-
ing from May Beatty’s pearl necklace helps
to commend “Little Nelly Kelly” to the
sympathy of an artless world, and Mark
Daly shows an unabated capacity for impart-
ing false value to cheap witticisms. Last
Saturday night the gorgeous production went
very promisingly. One felt, among other
things, that Leyland Hodgson’s fondness for
Mamie Watson because she reminds him of
mother is bound to give the cue for a new
popular outbreak of film?' affection in song.
Mother will be in the boom again.
“Aladdin,” at Melbourne Majesty’s, has
hardly a dull moment, but it has many of
bright humor, sparkling activities and charm-
ing spectacle. As a panto, with a plot, the
show is pervaded by the spirit of Ada Reeve
—Ada Reeve at her best; Ada Reeve clothed
in glorious silken jumpers and pants, and
graced by a romantic attachment to an
Emperor’s daughter; Ada Reeve in the
sweetest of singing voices, and with the most
winsome of personalities. One would say
that Ada made the panto, if it were not a
lively, handsome uproar apart from the lady-
boy in the name part. Citizens at large in
old Pekin and unspecified on the bill are
capital in more than one item; and an acro-
batic chorus of 16 barelegged charmers who
gladden the opening of the second act are
almost rivalled in value by the Girls of the
Old Brigade, disguised as caricatures of 60
years ago. The second-act opening scene is a
chaste setting in blue and white, of willow-
plate design, as refined in taste as the close
of the first act, which is a tricky transforma-
tion of Aladdin’s Cave* into a dream of
purely Parisian prettiness.

Tom Payne, as Widow Twaukey, makes a
Dame whom many people will place No. 1.
The big face and generous features of the
little man give good scope for grave expres-
sion ; certainly Payne’s Dame is a facially-
acted widow of distinction. Besides, Payne
dances quaintly, and his patter lines,
superior among patter of the kind, savor of
wit. In respect of facial comedy and un-
obtrusive mummery, George Welch is a satis-
factory Abanazar. Hector St. Clair, with
his fiddle and his trembling, tuneless voice,
threatens at the outset to become excessive,
but kindly refrains from executing the threat.
Neville Towns is a tall, impecunious Emperor
with a fine baritone voice and sudden cyni-
cal ideas re a son-in-law. Herbert Walton,
in the helmet of a ladylike policeman, has a
lot to do at odd times and is “great” in the
Old Brigade scene; Hope Charteris is a
dimpled, melodious soprano whose voice is
heard in solos and duets with Ada Reeve;

SHAVING STICK
barring a final tableau of strutting nymphs,
the eye is rarely invited to loiter on the
scenery. Moreover, a good deal of the pro-
gramme recalls the turns of more or less
recent vaudeville artists. Two clowns
mournfully scraping fiddles in acrobatic pos-
tures, and a pair of average jugglers re-
markable for their blinding wealth of rhine-
stones, arc among the more unexciting
intruders. The whirling of a death-defying
signor on a merry-go-round of his own de-
vising is accepted as a breathless novelty,
though his business on a trapeze over the
orchestra chiefly excites speculation as to
whether he would fall on the trombonist or
the second fiddle if he lost his grip. Of the
principals the most momentous in point of
physique is the leading lady, Amy Rochelle,
who now looks like a fugitive from a weight-
lifting act. From this lady's sturdy torso issue
various ballads, apparently written to ex-
hibit the untutored lustiness of her upper
register. Clemency is extended to Dorothy
Brunton, who seems dwarfed by her meagre
opportunities. Joe Brennan, as the Dame, is
a doss-house for homeless jests. Also his
croaky undertone isn’t overburdened with
fun. Dressed as a nightmare of wayward
girlhood he has some tedious chat with a
monocled johnny in a box. Heslop’s whim-
sicality tends now and then to resemble the
corybantics of a cat on hot bricks, but there
are moments in his golf sketch and else-
where which are genuinely diverting. Squire
Hardflint is lost in the heavy personality
of Oliver Peacock, David Loffman is a
substantial Demon Vulture, and William
Hassan’s goose is excellent and is almost
the only evidence that the absent fairy-tale
is hanging about waiting to make itself
heard. It is a pity to see Mione Stewart
tucked away among the also-rans. She is
more appealing than Maidie Field, whose
manner is productive of critical unrest. A
group of infant tumblers and dancers are
conspicuous, Ivy Towe among the latter
doing some pretty solo work.

Without uncorking any pleasant sur-
prises in vocal or dramatic quality, Frank
Rigo has justified his forecasts concern-
ing his first grand-opera production,
Humperdinck’s “Hansel and Gretel,” at
the Melbourne Playhouse., Grimm’s im-
mortal yarn about the cannibal witch
who, thanks to the luck of Gretel in
annexing her magic wand, is baked in the
oven she has “hotted up” to roast the two
lost children, has been skimmed of little
of its cream in the make-over. Further, the
music is arresting, and Ivost’s Symphony
Orchestra, of 30 strong, gets nearly every
ounce of charm out of it, although they are
polite enough to mute their melodious out-
pourings when the singers are in action. The
opera is given in English ; but as most of
the stars overlook the importance of the
vowels, they might as well be doing their
little bits in Hebrew. Gretel and her stage
mother are the least guilty in this matter.
William Reid, the father, releases a fine
baritone, about which a lot more should be
heard later. Roma Phillips could not be
bettered in appearance as the little German
girl; also she acts with a certain amount of
charm and has a good voice that needs train-
ing. Nellie Lafferty, as Hansel, sings indis-
tinctly. but with a pleasing note, though it
lacks depth in the middle register. Oddly
enough, the two give no cause for complaint
in their duets, in which their voices blend
harmoniously. The Witch is a nice fat
part, in which Vera Bedford has a good,
long-ranged voice to work on. Ruth
Phillips, as the Mother, sings agreeably in
the first act, and the chorus calls for more
than honorable mention —it is the star in
the final scene. The opera is reasonably well
staged, with some excellent lighting effects.
Of “Sally,” at Melbourne Royal, there is
nothing to say this Christmastide except
to wish the brightly inoffensive musical
comedy a happy New Year and a crowded
15th week. By the popularity of a comedy
that began to run in Sydney a year ago, and
has been running ever since, criticism is not
so much disarmed as crushed.
❖ * * .-k
An advt. of “French Leave,” at Mel-
bourne King’s, states that this play disre-
sembles any in which Miss Polini has pre-
viously appeared in Melbourne; and though
woman in general probably does not desire
anything of the sort, the Polini method
being associated with a particular kind of
theatrical fiction, yet in a said-to-be festive
season of alleged peace and goodwill some-
thing different may not be altogether out of
place. Perhaps the unkindest thing sayable
about “French Leave” is that it was written
on the war, during the war —in fact, in
the war —and is out of date for the time
being. Nevertheless, it is a chirpy play, and
the new blood in the company, especially the
blood of Garry Marsh, which is not over-
charged with red corpuscles, gets a fair
show in it. The King’s, considered from a
purely business point of view, has a unique
position in Melbourne just now. Every
other theatre features music, song and dance
on the menu; and whereas the person with a
skipping spirit has a large choice of goods to
select from, the soul in quest of sob-stuff
can find it only at the King’s.

“Thersites” persists:—
Because I said that Oscar Asche as Othello turned
his back on the Duke of Venice when delivering his
speech in the Senate, the actor-manager gives me
“the lie direct.” I now repeat the statement:
Mr.Asche did, stand dead-centre of the stage with his
back turned square on the presiding- Duke.
Not all the time, certainly, but long enough
on one occasion to conceal his Grace ■ from
a section of the audience. As for the
contention that “counsel sometimes faces the jury
and not always the Judge alone,” Othello is in no
sense a “counsel,” and even if he was he wouldn’t be
permitted to turn his back on the Judge. Neither
are witnesses, jurymen, police, servants, soldiers and
the general public admitted to a court across the
Judge’s dais, as in Mr. Asche’s council chamber, nor
does the Judge himself have to come down through
the body of the court and find his way out through
the crowd, My “stereotyped mistake” as. to the
propriety of the Moor stabbing Desclemona after
protesting “Yet I’ll not shed her blood,” is
squelched with the quotation “I would not have thee
linger in thy pain. So, so.” Well, Shakspeare doesn’t
give a direction just there, although the words “he
smothers her” and “unlocks the door” occur in
the same scene. Maybe, in spite of those directions,
Mr. Asche can read a butcher’s knife and buckets of
blood into “So, so,” but it is too vast a feat of
imagination for me.
From a city consulting-room :
Oscar Asche may be a good Shakspearean actor,
but he is ,no physio’ogist. His assumption (B.
20/12/’23) that stabbing after strangulation would
cause the life-blood to career through the veins
and enable a sensible sentence like “A guiltless
death 1 die” to be uttered is all moonshine. There
is no allusion to gore by either Othello or Emilia.
The serving-woman, having her sex’s curiosity largely
developed, would at once have cried out in horror
at the sight of a blood-stained garment. Consider
these lines, which are certainly suggestive of an-
other resort to garrotting—
Ila! no more moving?
Still as the grave.
There would be no stillness of the grave once there
was a free flow of blood. On the contrary, there
would be sighing and extreme restlessness. So Oscar
Asche’s theory that Shakspeare intended the snicker-
see to be called in to finish the business is not in
accordance with physiological fact. But actor-
managers have a penchant for departing from Shafes-
peare’s instructions. In Tree’s production of “Romeo
and Juliet” in 1913, Juliet, after the poisoning, cavorted
round the bedroom on her knees, uttering horrible
groans as one would do after the ingestion of an
irritant poison ; whereas she had been told by the
Eriar that a drowsy humor through her veins would
run, and that she would awake as from a pleasant
sleep. Essie Jenyns, in the old days at Sydney Royal,
took the poison in bed, quietly, and never moved a
muscle afterwards, as the Bard intended.
“Peter”: An increasingly unpleasant fea-
ture of Australian theatrical life is the autho-
rity wielded by the female star. Certain of
these dames exploit their alleged indispen-
sableness to the extent of dictating who shall
appear with them. Though they don’t get
their own sweet will in every case, they have
minor members removed from the cast for
reasons that have no bearing on the profes-
sional ability of the person sacked. One
bright little girl had to take her pretty
voice and good looks to another management
because the leading woman was jealous of
the notice Miss Smallpart had been getting
in the press. Another clever Australian
damsel who had been announced for a big
part in a forthcoming show got the “bird”
from the proprietary because an imported
female objected to her. This sort of thing
has become so common that it is necessary
to warn the aspirant that youth, beauty and
talent are not the only essentials of success
on the Australian stage. It is necessary also
to get on the soft side of the leading lady.
“Beamish”: The Boucicaults have a tre-
mendous regard for .T. M. Barrie. There is
an involuntary hush in their tones when
they speak of the small Scot, and, in their
eyes, the appearance of a new Barrie play
has almost the significance of a royal
accouchement. Some of this worship is pro-
bably a legacy from Boucicault’s old em-
ployer. Charles Froliman, who made a for-
tune out of “Peter Pan,” and had the gift
of infecting his friends with his enthusiasms,
even to the extent of inducing them to try
his favorite supper—-raspberry syrup and
apple-pie. Boueicault, however, has another
reason for loving Barrie, and that is his
amenableness in the hands of a producer.
Hasn’t Barrie altered scenes at “Dot’s” sug-
gestion? Has he not brought the new-born

MSS. to our little visitor and urged him to

would not escape his eagle eye?
“F.A.” : The. simultaneous success of “A
Southern Maid” and “The O’Brien Girl”
gave a knock to two ancient beliefs —one
that what “goes” in Melbourne will peter
out in Sydney (and vice verm), and the
other that Sydney won’t stand two shows
of the same type at the same time. Old
hands say that the distaste of the Sydney
theatregoer for anything that made a hit
on Yarra banks began with G. V. Brooke’s
first Ilarborside season. An adverse criti-
cism of Brooke’s opening performance com-
plained of the “puffing of this good but not
brilliant actor,” and affirmed that the “tastes
of Sydney and Melbourne lovers of the
theatre are as wide apart as the towns them-
selves.”
“Mancam” : In modest praise of his firm’s
humble efforts to raise the tone of the
theatre, E. J. Tait let off some pretty colored
fire. “I saw 169 plays,” said E.J., “and to
each of them I applied the question, ‘How
would Australia like this?’ ” “We do not,”
he explained, “want a crop of dubious sex-
plays and naked-girl revues.” So now you
know why we get “Cairo,” “Scandal,” “The
Bat,” “The Cat and the Canary,” “The Bad
Girl’s Funnybone” and other highbrow gems.
E.J. “hastened to add” that “we are not
frightened of any play.” Of course, he meant
any imported play.
.Totted down in the Fog:—
“The Last Warning,” an American thriller now at
the Comedy, mixes up audience and players in a
way that has exasperated the critics. The charac-
ters bob up in stalls, boxes and the gallery, where
half a dozen stage policemen try to arrest the villain.
One writer reports that, as he was about to take his
seat in the stalls,, “the‘leading actor brushed by me
with a shout, leaped over the orchestra, and con-
tinued his performance on the side of the footlights
he should never have been permitted to leave.” This
sort of foolery ought to be left to the revue houses
and the halls.
An Evening Standard writer announces that Oscar
Asche has been doing good business in Australia,
but “not quite so good as on his previous tour,
when he was accompanied by Lily Brayton. Ihe com-
mentator add : “I can get no news of Lily Brayton s
return to the stage, and no news of her at all except
that she is in London.”
Cyril Maude is reported to be writing a play. It
is his first effort in that line, but in collaboration
with a brother he compiled an excellent history of
the Haymarket.
Eva Moore, who has been writing her reminiscences,
tells a good one of Shaw. G.B.S. once had a brief
and luckless adventure in theatrical management with
Granville Barker as his partner. Eva met him
one day and inquired how his season was progressing.
“I have lost £7OOO up to date,” replied Shaw,
“and Barker has lost his other shirt.
“Abbot I 1 '.”: What an inferior crowd are
we Australians! Good enough for the vul-
gar business of winning battles like \ illers-
Bretonneux and Hamel and Romani and
“Germany’s black day,” but perfectly hope-
less when it comes to making faces at a
moving-picture camera or singing male-chorus
stuff in Dago opera. Preference to Yanks
is the policy in one case; preference to
Italians in the other. The uproar re the
male chorus for the Melba Opera ( o. re-
calls a disturbance with the Gonsalez com-
bination in Melbourne. In that instance
choristers were engaged locally on the un-
derstanding that they would be taken to
Sydney and M.L. But during the second
week of the season a score of Italian singers
arrived, and the Australians got a week's
notice. So forcible were their representa-
tions that the management changed its mind
and kept them on until the end of the 10
weeks’ season. Then they vanished. Mean-
time both nationalities appeared in the pro-
ductions.

“Csesar’s Ghost”: Christmas is the time
when aetor-rs who have been walking in
shabby clothes and broken boots burst into
sartorial splendor. Sideshow pantomimes,
now put on by the big stores, amateur theat-
ricals staged at school breaking-ups, and
reunions for which professional assistance
is required—these are responsible. Still,
as with the “pitchers,” the old-style mummer
sees some degradation in the business, and
my friend Augustus Getbird will have no-
thing to do with what he calls “the vulgar
commercialisation of our art.” But even
Augustus has benefited: through the absence
of one of the regulars on “this sordid store-
work,” Gus has an engagement with a
suburban show which would not otherwise
have sought his services. He patted a brown-
paper parcel as he told me about it. “And
so, after all the troubles nineteen-twenty-
three has brought,” he said, “to-night we
have sausages!” I tried to congratulate him
quickly and move away; but he got in the
usual good work. In brief, two shillings for
the wherewithal to wash down the bags of
minced meat.
A missive from Auckland (M.L.) :
“The Deacon” (B. 15/11/’23) is not wholly right
about the lady who was Marion Mitchell, of Pol-
lard’s. Mrs. Davis does not “divide her time be-
tween Britain and the Oontinong” ; she merely
happens to be abroad on a trip just now. Since her
marriage she has lived at Auckland, headquarters of
the Davis brewery, and there the other day her
daughter Molly Yvonne was married to Alan M.
Smith, member of a well-known Auckland family.
Yvonne, in “Paul Jones,” was her mother’s most
successful part. Most of the Pollard girls married
early and left the stage. Bettina Denise Sharman
is another Auckland damsel whose name records the
stage successes (“La Mascotte” and “Mam’zelle Nit-
ouche”) of her mother, who was Juliet Wray, of the
Royal Comics, before her marriage to Dr. Sharman.

“While he was training at Shoeburyness for his
fight with Beckett, Oarpentier often broke out into
song, revealing a sweet, melodious voice, by which
his hardened and unemotional sparring partners
were transported into raptures, (jarpentier’s mana-
ger, M. Deschamps, was similarly affected.”
’E punched ’im on the jor, did Bill,

An’ ’anded Joe a clout.

Enough to melt a bullock’s ’eart,
Or set the soul a-wing.
“Wot tenderness!” “Wot charm!” “’Ovv

Whilst Bill ’e got ole Joe well beat,
And gently sang ’is song;
From strong men’s eyes the ’ot tears fell,
They wrung their ’ands and wept like ’ell—
Such powers to Art belong!
It was a most perthetic sight
To see men moved so deep;
But still Bill landed left and right,
Wot time he made us weep ;
An’ then ’e let an ’ottie fly
And, singing a sweet lullaby,
’E put ole Joe to sleep.

There is No Substitute for Happiness!
A ROUND the corner just out of your town
there is a land of sunshine and happiness,
of surfing beaches, all within easy reach
with an OVERLAND.
Are you going to miss these, and the
pleasure and profit of seeing new places and
people, of renewing old friendships? Can
you afford to be without the means of quick,
cheap and comfortable transport?
The OVERLAND makes distant friends
close neighbors for less than railway fares
and in quarter the time. It brings the far
away close to hand, and the out of reach
within easy touring distance.
With an OVERLAND you can make your
business a pleasure during the week, and
enjoy the out-of-doors with your family or
friends at the week-ends, without a worry
about the excessive expense.
You get more real, solid pleasure out of
the OVERLAND because more value has
been built into it. You get the comfort, power
and finish, the deep leather upholstery that
has hitherto always been associated with cars
of much higher price.
Above all, you get a COMPLETE CAR,
magneto-equipped, with five rims, tyres and
tubes, a full equipment of tools, spare lamps,
spare spark plug, spare dynamo brushes and
battery hydrometer,
For the One Inclusive Cost of . . .

An Investment
TV THEN one purchases a six cylinder Paige-Jewett,
▼V he is not buying a motor car to tide him over for
the time being, as Paige-Jewetts are built to last a long
time, built that way by the makers, from the first chassis
member to the top of the hood. The purchase of a
Paige-Jewett should be viewed as an investment.

ANSWERS TO CORRESPONDENTS.
No notice (.except of a hostile character ) will be
taken of communications insufficiently stamped.
Name and address must appear on the MSS. No
liability is undertaken re contributions volun-
tarily submitted; and no MS. will be returned
unless stamps accompany.
F.A.F.: Thanks; same to you... .Fillup:
It was Hugh George who was imprisoned in Vic.
Parliament House. The Argus? (19/3/’66) published
an article accusing McCulloch, then Premier, of
making a speech “bristling with falsehoods.” George,
the publisher, refusing to either apologise or “pay
the fees,” was kept in custody till Parliament was
prorogued three weeks later.... Spa dger: Vigorous,
but not very interesting... .F.M.E.: We believe you
could write if you tried ; but it is a waste of time
to slop on over acres of paper saying nothing....
H. : No use here or herqufter.... Kay: Don’t try
the sonnet form till you get some feeling for verse.
. ...A.G.L.: The verse is poor and the point is
blunt.... W.E.8.: Sounds like the sort of yarn a
man with two mouths and five heads would tell if
you turned him upside down. .. .Louis C.: Not
enough there... .Cecil T.: We don’t find it convinc-
ing. ...R.R.: The verse is weak and crude. .. .G. 8.:
“Mountain Lad” is a poor imitation of poor stuff.
. . . . R.R. (Sandgate) : Not a bit of use writing with-
out something to say.... Syd Swagman: An ugly
yarn badly written.... Codex: Doesn’t strike u 5....
Starter: Yon go too far round to get there....
Jack Sprat: Sing it to the lady.... S.L.S.: There is
some music in it; but much of it is too obscure. ...
I. : Chatters not unpleasantly, but has nothing
real to say. ... Jas. McG.: To get near that gate, you
must write something instead of writing about
writing it... . Victor 1).: A man was hit on the head
by a burglar and recovered. That alone doesn't
make a thrilling appeal. Now if the burglar had
been hit on the head and hadn’t recovered, there
might have been the beginning of a yarn... .Darma:
No use to u 5.... Caesar: Handed over to the office
Brutus... .M.B. (Wellington): Sorry, but they must
have something real in them....K.G. (Waikane) :
A sonnet must be much better built than that....
Pioneer: The best of it won’t carry the worst of it.
....Mombak: it has all the marks of inspiration:
“Lovest thou not me?” said the swain to the bint,
“If not, dearest, thy heart is of flint,
But- for you I’d go to the Devil.
Wouldst be my wife, divinest Ethel?”
She merrily tossed a glance of scorn,
And bit her lip, and looked forlorn
“O Harold,” she gushed, “don’t be a fool;
But if you persist, the dog I will sool.”
Bravely he stood, and took his doom.
“Fair betrayer, youTl hear from me soon.”
He tore a last kiss, and sped down the track
As if legions of devils were at his back.
.. . . H.R.F.: Stiff verses about very little.... John
S.: Utterly hopeless... .W.J.E.: Not enough substance
there, and what there is isn’t well enough handled. ...
J.8.C.: Doesn’t get nearer than the “Welcome” on the
doormat... .P.J.F.: Not much of a yarn... .F.M.P.:
As thin as a politician’s weakest excuse... .1.8. M.:
The verse is not nearly good enough to carry the
idea.... J.M.W.: Wonders and wanders and gets to
nothing. . . .L.M.B. A thing like that wanted far
more vigorous handling. .. .E.J.F.: Topical verse must
do something more than merely repeat in bad shape
the gist of the prose heading... .J. 5.8.: Not for
us R.W.W.: Can’t find a thrill in it. Nor much
sense... .Meta G.: Not up to the mark yet....
G.W. J.: Not a short story. Merely the common-
place telling of some commonplace incidents... .Nor-
man: It doesn’t hit us where we keep our stores
of bullion... .0.F.A.: A mass of words —most of
them useless. .. .H.V.T.W.: Sorry ; no use. . . .8.C.F.:
A very long way off. .. .Frank H.: It couldn’t he
much worse.... Ena C.: Feeble little flutters....
William S.: Curiously clumsy and muddled....
L.0.J.: Not enough meat in your stew. . . .Ripponlea:
Don’t know whether we prefer the matter or the
manner:—
Cockeye Smithers hated cats,
And did love to at them smite;
Seeing one reclining on the fence,
On a dark and stormy night,
He did make an unconcerned pretence,
Then swiped with all his might.
But alas, he did make a tragic mistake
As homeward he did tread,
For he’d hit his grandmother on the head.
. .. .Norem: We have said it and sung it arid whistled
it, and no way at all can we make “curse” rhyme
with “hurts”.... J.V.C.: Sounds like hysterics... .
D. : Not in the summer, please. Wait till the
Spring to send us verse like that... .A.T.G.: Don’t
agree with you. The penniless man may make a
good farmer, hut the State isn’t justified in advanc-
ing him borrowed money to acquire a farm. It would
be quite as much justified in borrowing money to set
up a brickmaker in business.... Singapore: The
rats have been at your rhymes.
TO ARTISTIC (AND INARTISTIC)
CORRESPONDENTS.
D.G.: Promising; but drawing very wobbly in
spots... .C.S.: Both ancient.... Bust ’em Up: No-
where near the mark... .8.L.L.: You shouldn’t do
a thing like that—especially at Christmas time....
J.N.K.: Try them larger, to allow for reduction....
E. : Drawing as scratchy as a pen of cockerels,
and the jokes are old M.8.M.: That sheep’s not
a sheep—it’s a miracle.... J.F.: Your dream of
Christmas beer has vanished—Tilly rang the changes
on a very venerable gag. ...8.L.: That particular
dog-fight ended months ago... . A.Y.R.: All the
humor is in the big feet; and really we have left
off regarding them as very humorous.
Passed out at Hobart, P. S. Seager,
I 5.0., who came to the Speck as an infant
in ’45, entered the civil service 60 years ago,
and ended as Registrar of the Supreme
Court. Since his retirement at the age
limit he has been a busy member of all sorts
of boards, and now dozens, of codicils will
be required in Hobart, for he was a sort of
semi-public trustee and executor.

“D.F.”: They had some queer currency
in the old days. Governor King left it on
record that he paid a sealer 30 empty casks
as postage on a letter sent to King Island.

“Te Babarantiko”: “L.W.” (B. 6/12/’23)
can rest assured that whatever loss, if any,
stand-over cane represents, it certainly is
not “a dead loss/’ For some reason or other
most cane-farmers have had cane left standing
until next cutting season. That such cane
has been then found “next to valueless” is
nonsense; so is the statement that there is
next to no sugar in it. Stand-over cane
keeps on growing, and is always conspicuous
over the one-season crop by its superior
height and the thickness of its “sticks.” And
it is undoubtedly more pest-resistant than
the other.

“S.G.”: So early as the fifties of last cen-
tury Dr. Jiang proclaimed the suitability of
parts of Queensland for cotton cultivation,
and a good many crops were, in fact, pro-
duced. One sample of “Moreton Bay cotton”
was so fine in texture that Manchester,
Scotch and French weavers successively
tried their hands at it and failed. Finally
the raw material was sent to Calcutta and
converted by Hindoo weavers into what was
described a.s the “finest muslin even seen.” It
was estimated that cotton such as this would
then return about £4O per acre. But Ameri-
can competition killed the business after the
close of the Civil War.

“Devilfish” : Whaling on the coast of the
Speck goes back 10 years earlier than the
enterprise of Captains Fane and Haggard,
mentioned by “Pohutu” (B. 13./12/’23). In
1806 William Collins set up a whaling sta-
tion at Ralph’s Bay, the first enterprise of
the kind with its headquarters in Tasmania.
The earliest whaling in the Derwent was
done in 1804 by the Alexander, Captain
Rhodes. Jorgen Jorgenson claims to have
harpooned, as mate of the Alexander, the
first whale ever captured in the Derwent.
Jorgenson was a good liar, but he may be
telling the truth in this case. Hobart was
a whaling port for nearly a century; the last
of the old-time whalers was the Helen
McGregor, which kept at the game till about
1895.

“Thurdex” : I’m not well acquainted with
lodge doctors who do their own dispensing,
but I have seen enough to convince me that
North Queensland lodge doctors where there
is a chemist provided are on a good wicket.
A few years ago my lodge had a difference
with the 8.M.A.. with the result that our
medical officers were instructed to resign, and
did so. Instead of trying to patch up the
difference we accepted their resignations, and
advised that we would pay the usual non-
lodge patient’s fee per visit (10s. 6d.). Im-
mediately we had a visit from a rep. of the
meds. A bluff old doctor blew in and re-
marked : “It’s no good t 6 me. I’d be losing
money. Why, there are a quarter of my
patients that I have never seen, and another
quarter that I just know, and that’s all.
Never mind the B.M.A. I'll withdraw my
resignation.” So the dispute ended, all the
other resignations being similarly withdrawn.
I will admit that there are a few lodge mem-
bers who abuse their privileges. On the
other hand, T know of three who have been
on doctors’ lists for 20, 15 and 8 years re-
spectively, and have never been to the doc-
tor. Notwithstanding “Country Med.’s” ver-
sion (B. 29/11/’23) of why doctors take
lodge patients, my opinion is that the real
reason is that it pays.
THE ISLAND SCHOONERS.
[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
They kick their heels to the south-east trade,
They fight with the rough north-west;
By reef and palm their course is laid
Past hills in kuriai drest.
They know no fear when the hot wind blows
And the suns of the tropics shine;
But they set their course for the N'inigos
And bear up north to the line.
With billows curling and waters swirling,
When even the trade-winds scowl,
Over the wonder of coral under
They work around to Rabaul.
And, oh, but theirs is a motley crew
As ever a trader took,
Gathered from isles where the brown men grew
And fed by a Chinese cook.
There may be with them a Japanee,
Or a handsome young Malay;
But a white man ever .must oversee,
For that is the white man’s way.
With motors chugging and sails a-lugging
On crested waves they hang,
With white foam flashing and grey seas splashing,
They turn down south to Madang.
The copra bakes in the drying-shed
And the copra roasts in the sun,
But around the seas it must be sped
When the roasting and baking are done ;
And close to a thousand palm-girt bays,
By reefs where the white seas break,
The copra waits through the sunlit days
For the trade the schooners make.
With soft winds playing by palm-trees swaying
The schooners are hasting on ;
O’er deeps and shallows that beauty hal’ows
Their fluttering sails have gone.
And, oh, but the bays are wondrous fair
Where the island schooners go,
With waters as clear as a jewel rare
And flame-red flowers that glow’!
And, oh, but the bays are wondrous still
By the reefs where the white seas break ;
And the tall trees gleam on an island hill
In the night when the fireflies wake.
With warm airs blowing and strange lights glowing,
They rest ’neath a tropic moon;
But they’re off with the morning, all soft ways
scorning,
From Vitu or Manus Lagoon.
For this is the sure, unchanging way,
The law of things as they are:
If some by home and love may stay
Then some must wander far.
And far and far brown schooners fare
From home and love and grief;
And few will know and few’ will care
When they pile at last on a reef,.
And few r will know and few will care
When they sleep by the coral reef.

Pillans, the stormy petrel of Litligow
(N.S.W.), has been elected Mayor for the
10th time. Prior to this year the canny
Scot had as tight a grip on the presidentship
of the western miners, and in that capa-
city was a thorn in the side of ironmaster
Hoskins; but nowadays the lion and the
lamb can sometimes lie down together.
“Sucre": Mourilyan (N.Q.) has put up
a new sugar record. A farmer carted his
crop to the local mill, and after the rollers
had finished the analysis was 20 c.c.s. A
special rate had to be struck to pay for this
abnormal density. By the use of a little
fertiliser this cocky hopes to be able to de-
liver his next crop direct to the grocer and
cut out the mill-middleman.
Just-dead Sir Frederick Treves, the sur-
geon who won fame by operating on Edward
VII. for appendicitis, narrowly missed becom-
ing an Australian. He was practising at Mar-
gate when the continued illness of his
wife made him decide to bring her to Aus-
tralia ; but she died just before arrange-
ments were completed. Nurse Chadwick,
who was in charge of the organisation of
the nursing stall's for hospital ships in the
Boer War days, was a niece.
William Allan Pinkerton, dead at 77, was
the last of the Pinkertons, of Yankee detec-
tive fame. Founded over 70 years ago by
Allan Pinkerton, the firm might never have
come into existence but for blind luck.
Pinkerton was a cooper living in Illinois,
and when out cutting staves for barrels
one day he blundered upon a gang of coun-
terfeiters. He informed the police, and the
1000-dollar reward enabled him to start in
the detective business. His two sons joined
him, and they made a doughty trio.
“Yoyang”: Although the late Mrs. Hey-
don, who died recently at Wagga (B.
6/12/’23), may have been one of the early
settlers, “having arrived there with her
parents (Elliotts) 66 years ago,” there
were others around Wagga long before 1857.
Franklin had a blacksmith’s forge there in
1846; J. J. Roberts built the first hotel
about ’46; and Dr. R. Davison erected the
first brick store in ’49. Gumly Gumly
station, five miles from Wagga, had been
run by Mrs. Bourke (afterwards Mrs.
Peter) for some years when 1845 dawned,
and parish registers show that there were
numerous births at Wagga in the ’forties.
“Melaleuca”: “Yacko” (B. 6/12/’23) re-
vives the story of La Perouse having visited
Tasmania. This romantic tale arose from
Captain Bunker misapprehending the con-
tents of a bottle which he found at Adven-
ture Bay in 1809. As a matter of fact this
bottle was a relic of D’Entrecasteaux’s visit
to V.D.L., and was not left by La P’erouse.
West, in his history of Tasmania, states:
“Letters buried in a bottle beneath a tree in
Adventure Bay were found by Captain
Bunker, of the Venus, in 1809. to which he
was directed by the words (in French) ‘Dig
underneath’; he supposed, from his imperfect
knowledge of the language, that they were
left by Perouse. In this he was mistaken ;
they were deposited by D’Entrecasteaux at
his second visit.” “Bent’s Almanac” (1828)
adopted Bunker’s mistake; and it was copied
by other chroniclers of the period. Recent
writers, unaware, apparently, of the early
error, have stated that there is some evidence
to show that La Perouse visited Tasmania,
but actually there is none whatever.
“Coot” : Melbourne’s bridge over the Yarra
at Spencer-street is nearly as hardy an
annual as Sydney’s North Shore structure.
In 1860 a Royal Commission recommended
that a swing bridge be built at Spencer-
street. Nothing more happened till 1881,
when the then Minister of Works called for
competitive designs; but the Government
went out before any were hatched. In 1889
competitive designs were again called for,
and this time three prizes were awarded for
a swing bridge; after which the plans were
carefully forgotten. In 1912 a committee of
engineers recommended a movable bridge.
Recommendation noted—and shelved. The
next resurrection occurred in 1918, when the
Traffic Congestion Board urged the imme-
diate construction of a bridge to carry vehi-
cular and tramway traffic. But nothing
having been done, immediately or otherwise,
another Board was appointed in 1922, and it
reported to the same effect. Beyond endea-
voring to allocate the estimated cost of the
structure between the municipalities, the
Lawson Government has, howevei% done no-
thing, and the business will go over till 1924.
“Azac”: N.S.W. Minister for Lands
Wearne, who is also spare-time Minister for
Forests, in a preface to W. W. Froggatt’s
book on “Forest Insects of Australia,” writes
in regard to the injury to timber by insects:
“If the economic loss could be estimated, it
would ax-ouse the public mind fx-orn its apathy
in regard to the introduction of the boi-er and
other pests from abroad.” Merely another
stupid platitude! It isn’t the vague “public
mind” that must be reached; it is the build-
er’s mind, the ai-chitect’s mind, the timber-
man’s mind. Froggatt, in his new job of
protector of our forests against borers and
other pests, should be in a position to reach
these. As Government Entomologist for
very many years, he talked only through the
stodgy pages of the Agricultural Gazette,
which foresters seldom read, builders and
architects won’t read, and timbermen never
read. There has been really no serious at-
tempt to remove apathy from the minds of
those who shoixld be alive to such a question.
I recently obtained a leaflet from the Depart-
ment of Agriculture on the powder-post borer
(Lyctus irunneus ) —the borer that does
most damage to building timbers —and after
reading it passed it on to a timberman
acqxxaintance. When he had perused it he
candidly admitted that he then knew a hun-
dred times more about the pest than he did
before. Yet the pamphlet, writteix by Fi*oggatt,
and issued by the Department of Agriculture
“for distribution to farmers,” I was told,
had been in existence about 10 years. As
for others’ apathy, I recently saw a valua-
tion by a leading city firm of architects in
which they mentioned: “Whether roof tim-
bers are badly or slightly infested with borers
would make no difference to a valuation, as,
in our opinion, the fact there are signs of
borers does not detract from the value of
any building.” It is this kind of apathy,
and not the apathy of that vague thing, the
“public mind,” -which Minister Wearne should
direct Froggatt to counteract.

Why Not Enjoy a
Good Complexion?
You cannot, if you do not care for tlie delicate skin of the face.
When you wash your face do you realise that it is not enough to
simply remove the dirt, but that your skin needs a soothing, healing
influence to keep your complexion fresh and free from blemish?
Scented toilet soaps are often very pleasant, hut do not, assert this
influence, as you are well aware. Many of them contain free alkali,
which tends to dry up the skin and destroy its delicate texture.
Even the better-class of such soaps do not in any way help to
improve the skin; but Rexona Skin and Facial Soap is not
only an absolutely pure Soap, but is medicated on
the same principle as the famous Rexona
Ointment, which is famous throughout
all of Australasia as the Rapid
Healer. That is why Rexona
Soap really does for the skin
and face 'what cosmetics are
supposed to do, by ensuring not
only a clean face but a pure
and healthy skin, and thus gives,
you a clear complexion.

The Wind that Blows by Gabo.
[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
\ HE wind that blows by Gabo
I Is ever kind to me;
M. It brings me songs and stories
Across tlie Tasman Sea.
When in a mystic starlight
The darkened surges break,
It tells me of Pizarro
And Cavendish and Drake.
I hear their drums a-beating,
And once, dear lads, again
Gay Youth and Glad Adventure
Go down the Spanish Main.
A cloud from distant cannon
Hangs low along the blue;
I see the cutlass flashing
In days of derring do.
The wind that blows by Gabo,
It sings a gallant song
Of proud Castilian captains
And ruffians rude and strong
Who sailed from Cartagena,
And out of Callao,
Across our Southern Ocean
Three hundred years ago.
The wind that blows by Gabo,
So cool in summer-time,
It croons a seaward fancy
That sadly falls in rhyme
Of one dear Spanish lady,
In silk and lace ashine,
Who waited for a lover
Gone south across the Line.
And, sobbing in the tea-trees,
Despite three hundred years,
It sings her life-long sorrow,
It whispers of her tears!
But when the moon is shining.
And Spring-tides leap the bars,
I see a Rover’s topmasts
All shattered ’neath the stars;
I see his oaken bulwarks
Still ragged from the fray.
Ills torn, red flag triumphant—
A victor grimly gay.
The wind that blows by Gabo
On one historic day,
It brought the old Endeavour
To Mallacoota Bay.
(Ho. ho! my Lords of England.
This ’prentice lad from Deal
Has marked a mighty roadway
With her immortal keel!)
The warships and the trade-ships
They followed, one by one;
The wind that blows by Gabo.
It bore them bravely on.
And oh ! the dandy captains.
And oh ! the dowdy crews
That beat around the corner
When Waterloo was news !
And hey ! the glossy clippers.
With British cargoes full.
That swung around the corner
To load Australian wool !
And old Colonial packets
In early days of steam —
The Gabo wind doth paint them
In pictures of a dream!
The wind that blows by Gabo,
When I am dead and gone,
To some Australian poet
This tale will carry on.
And he with broader vision
In wider ways, perchance.
Will write the splendid story
Of our great Sea Romance.

E.J. BRADY.
The Maun with the Halo.
[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
“rpALKm- about second-’and shops,
■ Alfred, reminds me that at the
time I met the man who ought
to wear a halo I was up to the usual game
—lookin’ out for mugs, an’ dressed the part.
I useter wear short trowsis an' stockin’s.
an’ a straw ’at like the son of a poor but
’onest widder-woman. Me boots useter be
nicely blacked, but cracked an’ down at the
heels, an’ me starched collar ’ad a edge on
it at the turn like a tennin-saw, an’ gave me
a sore neck. An’ I useter mix with other
office kids, seeking information for blokes
like you. Sometimes I useter get inter bars
where blokes from Back o’ Beyond flash
rolls of notes so’s Flossie, the barmaid, can
see what free-handed hayseeds they are, an'
Flossie would turn to me an' say, ‘Nipper, if
you see Spud, tell him I’d like to see him.’
My spoil was a jim or two of the wad when
Spud had dealt with the bloke from Way-
back. -
“I was walkin’ along George-street when
1 noticed a kid goin’ to pay a bill for his
boss. Funny ’ow people who ain’t useter
money like to look at it an’ flash it before
other people. Like the splay fool from
Back o’ Beyond, that dear little Sunday-
school office kid couldn’t resist takin’ the
money outer his breast pocket to look at.
Twenty-one quid it was, an’ a bill. An’ I
kep’ close beside him, waitin’ me chance.
“Nex’ thing I knoo he was sooling a
strange fox-terrier on to a cattle-dog. It
was the surprise of my life. I’d never expect
it of him, an’ him such a good little boy.
You would think to look at him butter
wouldn’t melt in his mouth. I thought,
‘What would yer ma say if I told her, yer
wicked child ?’ Then I went up to him an’ took
him by the coat an’ shook him. ‘You leave
my dog alone,’ I said. ‘l'm not touchin' yer
dog,' he said. ‘Yer soolin' your dog on to
my dog,’ I said, ’lt ain't my dog. either,’ he
said. ‘Well, why do yer want to sool any
dog on to my dog? I’ve got a good mind to
tell a John Dunn about yer. If one comes in
sight I will. Don’t you know it’s against the
law to make dogs light in George-street
‘No, l didn’t know,' he said. He couldn t
talk very well because 1 shook him so much.
•Well, i’ll let you oft' this time, but the next
time you do it, don’t do it. that's all,' 1 said.
Then* l got down a passage an' round some
stairs, an’ down a back way, an’ counted the
money. It was twenty-one pounds all
right.
“It was in a back yard where I sat, full
of empty packing-cases. Before I counted
the dough I looked round, an' nobody was
there, but while 1 counted a ’and closed
over mine. It was 11 ke nobody comin from
nowhere. It gave me the fright of me life.
I closed me fist on the money tight an
looked up.
"Alfred, without the word of a lie, 1 never
saw a more terrible-lookin’ man. lie had
eyes like gimlets borin' inter yer. He had a
week's growth of whiskers, an' hadn’t had a
wash fer as long. His face was like a
death’s ’ead in color, but the look on it of a
gunman, or the bad man of the Wild West
wot you sec in the pictures. The sight of
him made cold water run down me back, an’
give me a yearnin’ feeling in the pit of me
stomach.
“ ‘Clarence Algernon Fitzmaurice.’ he
said, ‘not a word on yer life.'
“In his other ’and was a wicked-lookin’
sheath knife. I knew that if 1 shouted it
would be the end of me. All I could think
to say was, ‘Me name ain’t Clarence Algernon
an’ the other thing.’
“He hisses in me ear: ‘lt is Clarence
Algernon. Wot I says goes.’
“He kept his ’and gripped on mine, an'
his gimlet eyes kept borin’ through me. I've
seen bad men, but 1 never thought the world
held, men as bad as that. 1 felt like a
sparrow with a snake lookin’ at him.
“ ‘Open yer ’and,’ he whispered,
“Alfred, I couldn't. Lumme, to think of
those beautiful twenty-one jim I’d earned
be the sweat of me brow, an’ had built on
havin’ such a fine time with! Me ’and
gripped ’arder than. over. He kept his eyes
borin’ inter me.
“ ‘Clarence Algernon,’ lie hissed, ‘did yer
read in the papers of the bloke found mur-
dered last Chewsday in the Domain? Did
yer read ’ow the bloke who put his light
out was reckernised an’ chased, but got
away? I’m the bloke wot got away. Open
yer ’and.’
“I never knowed I loved money so. Me
’and seemed to be sufferin’ from nervous
contraction, an’ to save me life the fingers
wouldn't come undone. His other ’and crept
down with the knife in it. It was right
under me throat.
“ ‘I killed that man in the Domain for
nothing. It is twenty-one jim you’ve got in
yer ’and. Md. I counted it. Twenty-one jim
would give me the chance to get aw T ay. Won’t
yer undo yer ’and, an’ I might let yer go?
Mind yer, I'm not promising, but I might
let yer go.’
“1 knew there never was any lettin’ go for
me. Alfred. 1 knew the bad man would get
the dough, an’ leave me balked in me own
blood. I offered up a prayer; if I got out
of this I’d get work an’ go to church reg’lar.
“ ‘Clarence Algernon,’ he said, ‘human life
is nothing to me. I’ve killed men an’ I’ve,
killed sheep, an’ I’ve felt sorrier for the
sheep afterwards than wot I ’ave for the
men. Dead or alive, that twenty-one quid is
mine, but l want no noise. Not a whisper.
Just undo’ yer ’and.’
“The knife was so close to me throat l
could feel the edge. Then I let go. All the
time 1 kept thinking. When the ’and let go
I started to cry. Not loud, but in a low
voice. 1 couldn’t help it, Alfred. 1 knew
that me last moment ’ad come, an’ 1 felt so
sorry for meself that I started to blubber
like a kid. I kep’ thin kin’ that if I'd ’ad a
widdered mother, an' me corpse wuz found
in among the empty packing-cases she'd’ve
broke her heart, an' I half wept for the
mother I 'adn’t; got.
“ ‘Wot yer cryin’ for, kid?’ he asked. He
had stowed the twenty-one pounds in his
pocket, bill an’ all, but the knife was still at
me throat.
“ ‘l’m thinkin’ of me mother. She's a
poor woman with a withered right arm an'
can’t work, an' I'm her only support. I
work in a office an’ the boss sent me to pay
the bill. I'll get the sack, an' me mother
will be put out of the ’ouse.’
“ ‘Clarence Algernon,’ he asked, suspicious-
like. ‘is this true?’
“ 'lt's gorstruth.’
“ ‘Then why are you among a lot of empty
packing-cases counting it?’
“He had me there, Alfred. For a minute
I felt floored, but when yer up against it
yer got to think quick.
“ ‘I like to look at money an’ feel wot it's
like. It is so seldom I ever get a chance to
see it.’
“ ‘Couldn't you look at it in the street?’
“‘Wot!’ I said. ‘With all the crooks to
see yer lookin’ at it!’
“lie kept his grip on me, an' he let his
chin sink on his chest. He was thinkin'.
Neither of us moved. I wanted to say more
for me life, but 1 didn’t dare. 1 mighter
said too much.
“ ‘Kid,’ he said. ‘Take yer money. I
want it, I want it more than you know how.
It means so much to me, maybe me life.
But I’m not robbin’ widders. Hun off an’
run quick before I change me mind.’
“He shoved the notes an’ the bill inter me
hand an’ let go, an’ I darted off quick as he
told me to.
“That, Alfred, is the man I said ought to
wear a halo. I thought so then; I think so
now.”
“Couldn’t you divide with him?” asked
Alfred.
“How could I divide with the yarn I
told him?” said Nipper Nugent. “It. was
all or nothin’.”
“I wonder wot became of him?” asked
Alfred.
“The John Dunns got him. He was
’anged three months later for the Domain
murder.”
“ ’Ow did they get him?”
“It happened there was a policeman in the
street when 1 got out, an’ I told him where
he was hidin’. You see. there was a reward.”

Yet to endure such misery is both foolish and unnecessary
You want to be well, and the quickest way to get well is
to find the cause of your trouble and correct it. More than
likely it’s your kidneys. That dull, nagging backache
may be Nature’s first warning of some hidden kidney
weakness. You may have headaches and dizziness, too,
with sharp, stabbing pains, a depressed, nervous feeling,
and annoying bladder irregularities. Help your weakened
kidneys before it is too late. Use Doan’s Backache
Kidney Pills. Doan’s have helped thousands and should
help you. Ask your neighbors!
A MAN’S CASE.
Mr. William Carroll, sen., ex-railway guard, 749 Harris
Street, Pyrmont, Sydney, says:—“Some time ago I strained
myself pushing some heavy trucks, and soon noticed the effect
in the small of my back. For three solid months I was unable
to work, and was laid up. I had a very lame back, and a dull
pain through the loins and the kidneys, and my secretions became
unnatural and irregular. I consulted a doctor, who recom-
mended Turkish Baths; but, though I got a little ease, I could
not work. I used Doan’s Backache Kidney Pills, and obtained
wonderful relief; in fact, so much so that I can now. do heavy
work. I am fully convinced that Doan’s Backache Kidney
Pills are a true Kidney remedy, and I .never fail to recommend
them among my friends.”
Twenty years later Mr. Carroll says:—“l am still a
great believer in Doan’s Backache Kidney Pills. They cured
me many years ago, and by taking them now and again I keep
in splendid health.”

PEOPLE
CURED OF
BACKACHE
AND KIDNEY
TROUBLE
A WOMAN’S CASE.
Mrs. M. Whitbread, sen., “Amherst,” Napoleon Street,
Mascot, Sydney, says:—“For years I suffered terribly from
backache and kidney trouble, and was at times so ill that I had
to lie up for days. My back ached terribly, and I was almost
crippled with the ailment, every movement making the pain
worse. My ankles and legs swelled considerably, and I knew
this was a sign of dropsy. I also had trouble with the secre-
tions, was subject to dizziness, and felt tired and languid. I
was really far from well, and having seen Doan’s Backache
Kidney Pills advertised at different times, it at last occurred to me
to try this remedy. I got some, and it proved a blessing, giving
quick relief, and gradually effecting a perfect cure. I feel
splendid now, and have only Doan’s Backache Kidney Pills to
thank for my wonderful recovery.”
Two years later Mrs. Whitbread says:—“My cure has
proved a permanent one, no sign of kidney trouble having
returned since Doan’s Pills cured me over two years ago.”

Fate.
[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
m WILIGHT fell as we started moving
I up to the line. In the bustle of “pack”-
staeking, foot and iron-ration inspec-
tions, and the taking over of the extra ban-
doliers of ammunition which authority had
provided, the word passed round that Joe
Hastie had the wind up. Of all men Joe had
hitherto shown most confidence. “There
isn’t a shell with my number on it,” he used
to insist.
While waiting for the “fall-in” I noticed
Joe, and walked to where he was sitting. His
face was pale.
“What’s the matter?” I asked.
“Letters from Aussie. My girl is dead.
Killed in a motor accident.”
Then I understood. Apart from his sor-
row, a fatal blow had been dealt to his
optimism. Always he had supplemented his
laughing declarations of faith in his destiny
with : “I’m as safe as my girl in Australia!”
And now she was gone.
The “fall-in” whistle interrupted my
attempts to comfort him; and we moved off
from the yard of the farm in which we were
billeted, to join up with the rest of the bat-
talion in the sand-bagged village street.
The Diggers began the customary pre-
battle banter. This was to be the battalion’s
last time in the line, because there wouldn’t
be any battalion by the time it was finished,
and so on. Hastie was ordinarily as bright
at this sort of thing as most, but to-night he
walked dumbly, his face strained and his
feet dragging. The twilight faded and the
night rushed in. The long line debouched
on to a cobbled road, on which the nails of
the men’s boots rang ; there was a clanking
of bayonet scabbards against mess-tins ; sharp
clinks as rifle-barrels, eased on the shoulders,
hit. steel hats; the steady buzz of conversa-
tion. Through it all Hastie plodded on in
silence.
Somewhere ahead we caught the metallic
clash of shells bursting on cobbles; and the
order swept back: “Side of the road!” We
crouched near a ditch and talk dropped to
whispers. But the shelling was only desul-
tory, and soon, obeying a movement, we
were up and moving on again. The next
order was “March softly, and silence!” and
one heard only the slither of feet, and the
occasional clink of metal.
Two stretcher-bearers appeared with a
prone Digger, who laughed, “It’s a Blighty,
boys!” and then gave a sudden groan. A
few yards farther on we found a wrecked
limber with its mutilated horses, which
marked where a shell had landed well on its
target.
The dark was intense. A flash of ghastly-
light soared into the air. And where the
ranks ahead had wheeled to the left we
came to a sudden halt.
“Christ Almighty!” cried someone. “Must
they always pull us up at crossroads, just
where Fritz is most likely to shell? Y’never
see the heads stopping there themselves.”
At that moment I heard a surprised cry of
“Wheryergoing, Joe?” I turned to see Hastie
pushing his way out of the ranks and mov-
ing forward. Taking his arm, I found him
shaking.
“Look! O my God, look!” he said. His
arm swept upward; and, in the green gleam
of another Verey light I saw in a niche of
the battered wall a small shrine, containing
an image of the Virgin. The light faded
swiftly, as the flare fell, but Hastie was
shuddering.
“You think me windy!” he whispered.
“Well, I am windy. So would you be if
you saw suddenly a place you’d dreamt of in
nightmares when you were a kid. That’s this
place! I’m going.”
At this stage, to my, relief, we all moved
again. I marched beside him.
“It’s silly,” I urged: “There’s shrines
like that everywhere in, France, at cross-
roads. You must have seen scores like it
before.”
“No ; not just like that one! Good God,
man, don’t you think I know the place of my
nightmare? I’ve seen it time after time, and
always the same; me down and helpless and
being run over, with those broken walls fac-
ing me, and the Virgin Mary looking down !
Night after night!”
“Why hasn’t it worried you before?”
“No other place has reminded me; this
has. I tell you, Blue, my number is up, and
that shrine is where I finish.”
“Well, you’ve left it,” I replied, “and we
probably won’t come back this way.”
He paused, so that the man behind almost
collided with him. An idea had struck
him.
“Cripes!” he said, “I’ll see I don't pass
there again. Perhaps it was only a warn-
ing, and, anyway, the danger’s past now.”
Someone whispered urgently, “Cut out the
talking!” and Joe was silent again. But I
could see that his spirit was returning, and I
was glad, for the sight of him marching dumbly
like a condemned man to the scaffold had been
chilling. Also, it did no good to the others.
It was the Diggers’ ability to jest over a
sagging heart that helped them to do great
things, and the man who openly showed fear
damped the courage of the others.
Hastie was not the reckless, death-defiant,
battler he had been. But as long as there
was activity his old confidence seemed to
live again.
He was particularly cheerful on the night
our relief arrived ; but when, having dropped
back to supports, we marched to rear bat-
talion headquarters, he slipped away for a
time. He returned in a panic.
“I’m going to dodge off, and join you
when you’re back along the old road,” he
said. “I just got hold of one of the guides,
and he told me that we’re going out the same
way as we came in. It’s no good to me,
Blue! I'm dodging it! I'm not going to
pass that corner again!”
Before I could reason with him he was
gone, and I saw his shadow, through a mist
that the moon made grey, break off from the
road and through a hedge.
There was some shelling, but it fell well
away to our right, and, disregarding it, we
quick-marched on. As we passed the cross-
roads which had so terrified Hastic, I looked
up curiously at the dark shrine in the shadow’
of the wall. But shortly we w T ere away from
it, listening to the sounds of shells falling
on the road well back of us, and glad that
wo had not halted for the passing of the
former shell spasm. I found, surprisedly,
that I had a torn sleeve and a scratch on the
arm, which would have to receive attention
at the dressing-station.
Hastie, as I afterwards learned, after
breaking through the hedge, took a path
which he judged to be a short cut to where
he could w r ait for us on the farther road.
He was making good progress when the
vicious scream of shells sounded over his
head, and simultaneously, with muffled roars,
the earth ahead of him sprang up darkly in
three places. He ducked, and then, with
thudding heart, ran. More shells shrieked
at. the back of him, and thudded to explosion,
the spray of viciously singing shell-pieces
and earth humming over him as he threw
himself dow r n again. Then there was a
yellow flash before him-—he had not heard
the scream of that shell; and when the rain
of its explosion had passed he was running
again, tw’isting and dodging, as shells fell
all about him. He knew’ now that he was
in the midst of an “area shoot,” and the
horror of being hit and lying in undiscovered
agony was in his soul. The shells seemed
to be shepherding him.
Sweating with terror and shaking with
fear, he broke through on to a roadway.
And then he suddenly knew he w r as wounded,
hit in the thigh, faint and giddy, and hardly
able to stand. Into his swaying sense came
a feeling of exultation. This would be a
Blighty, which would take him out of it
all. And still he staggered on.
His consciousness returned with the sharp
sound of shells cracking on cobble-stones.
He was lying on cobbles, and right in the
middle of a roadway. Dazed though lie was,
he caught a note which sent him cold with
terror. Amidst the crashing of the shells
there was a new sound: the frenzied beat
of the hoofs of horses stampeding, out of
control, and the rumble of limber wheels.
The din was rapidly approaching. He
struggled to lift himself, but found that
the leg he needed for leverage was useless.
A frantic agony and the memory of an old
nightmare came to him.
With the bolting limber almost on him he
looked up and saw the Virgin in her shrine
smiling compassionately down.
He was past hope when they brought him
into the dressing-station. He told me his
story in gasps.
“If you had come with us, Joe, you would
have been safe,” I blurted out in my grief.
“It was Fate,” he whispered as he died.
HAMER.

[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
"1 HE said to her own heart —all hushed
she said,
While the moon shed
Silver on all the world sighing with Spring.
Half amid wondering—
She said “Lord Love will come” ; and laugh-
ing low
Saw her breasts glow,
Rounded and white, and all her clouding
hair
Dusk from the mirror fair.
She said, “As pure as dewy lilies break
To bloom, and take
Shining the sunrise while the grass is dim,
I keep my soul for him ;
Love who will gladden all my quiet days,
Shall he not praise?”
Low-voiced she murmured; and around her
sweet
And smooth youth, overfleet,
Rose the warm flood of dream, till the still
night
Waned and the light
Of the pale dawning through her lattice wide
Streamed and the starshine died.
The Spring days deepened in the chequered
light,
Golden and bright.
Beneath green trees, swept with a foamy tide
Of bloom, desire soon cried
In maid and man. And when the evening
drew
Her veils of blue
About the quiet earth, all trembling, young
And new-vowed lovers clung.
Young girls of ivory limb came murmuring.
When the bright Spring
Was one with Summer, “Ah, did Love not
hold,
As the round moon grew gold,
You in his arms while all the amorous night
Knew your delight
And all your longings stilled and all your
sighs!
But, dreaming, her blue eyes
Gazed beyond them: and suddenly she said
“Youth is soon fled!
Oh, ere this summertide. now rising, fall
I shall give Love my all!”
Love came. w In cloth of gold Love lordly
came,
A gem-like flame
Burned on his brows. And she, all glowing,
drew
Back from her lattice, knew
Fear and delight. Her soul and body burned.
One fire, and yearned,
Desiring him more than the blue twilight
Desires the early white
Flowering of stars. And then Love, as a god.
With careless footsteps trod....
Love passed her house and came to kneel
before
The painted harlot’s door.
