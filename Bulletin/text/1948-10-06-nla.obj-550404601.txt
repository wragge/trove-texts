TIfINCHELSEA, one of the ancient
. towns of the Cinque Ports Con-
federation, is one of the very roots of
English history and from which the great
trade of the British Commonwealth has
grown and spread into every part of the
world. The Confederation consisted of
Dover, Hastings, Hythe, Romney and
Sandwich as Cinque ports and Rye and
Winchelsea added as Ancient Towns.
Seven centuries ago they were among the
busiest ports of the South of England.
Until the reign of Henry VIII these
Cinque Ports provided the only fleet that
England possessed. For these services
the Freemen of the Ports and Towns
were granted certain privileges, among
them the license to trade in any English
borough without tax or toll.
Today the original Winchelsea has
totally disappeared owing to the en-
croachment of the sea during the 13th
century, and its successor is a quiet, con-
templative little village surrounding the
chancel of its former noble church.
Edward I founded the “new” part of
Winchelsea at the close of the 13th cen-
tury. It was planned on an ambitious
scale with important public buildings,
fortified walls and gates.
The Strand Gate, pictured here, is one
of three gateways standing today. The
narrow arch is now a menace to traffic,
admitting as it does only a single line,
but Winchelsea would rather be without
her traffic than her majestic gateways.
Just above the gateway is the Look-
out, from which extensive views of the
English Channel may be obtained, and
the visitor may conjure up the romance
of the coastline at this point where the
smugglers and raiders of Rye and Win-
chelsea combined and set out on their
reprisal visits to the French coast. Be-
side the Strand Gate is a cottage, once
occupied by the actress Dame Ellen
Terry and where the Duke of Wellington
stayed when he visited Winchelsea for
the purpose of reviewing the troops
during the Napoleonic Wars.

CENSORSHIP COMMENTS.
[In a review of the Australian literary
scene in London “Life and Letters,” the
magazine with which is incorporated the
famous old “London Mercury,” Jack
Lindsay has some remarks on the way
Australia treats its authors: —
Internally, as part of the sharpening
political struggle, a quite fierce effort is
being made to attack freedom of expression.
The Victorian Parliament has savagely ex-
tended the Obscene Publications Act.
Georgian House, a reputable Melbourne
firm which had done a lot to help the
cultural advance during the war, was given
the crushing fine of £500 for publishing
Robert Close’s Love the Sailor [jic], a
work which all responsible critical opinion
has considered to be a serious bit of
writing; and worse, the author has been
fined £100 and sentenced to three months in
jail. At the moment (May) he is out on
bail awaiting the hearing of his appeal. In
N.S.W., Angus and Robertson, veteran
publishers of the highest standing in Aus-
tralia, have been fined for “offensive” pas-
sages in Lawson Glassop’s We Were the
Rats “Angry Penguins,” before its de-
cease, was lined for “obscene passages.”
Decidedly Australian authors have got a
fight on their own doormats.
Australia, while this sort of thing is
being reported, must look lamentably
provincial to an English audience; but
that is not so important as the fact that
every Australian author is at present
working under the vile threat of prosecu-
tion and even imprisonment. The Red
Page has submitted (B. 4/8/’48 and B.
29/9/’48) that the only practicable
remedy is to amend the various State
laws so that, before a prosecution is
launched, the book in question may be
submitted to the expert opinion of a
body similar to the Commonwealth
Literature Censorship Board, which was
set up to protect classic and overseas
literature from the assaults of the illi-
terate. Further comments on this plan
are printed below and others will be pub-
lished next week.]
From Dr. Frank Louat : —
I emphatically disagree with the pro-
posal for creating a new censorship board
to pronounce its opinion on Australian
publications. To set up a new arbitrary
body of this kind would be a disastrous
retrograde step. The suggested device
would afford no protection at all to Aus-
tralian writers but would simply expose
them to a further hazard —the hazard of
whether the fruits of their work com-
mended themselves to whatever culti-
vated gentlemen might be selected as the
pundits.
In my opinion the remedy for the pre-
sent unsatisfactory position is perfectly
clear and straightforward. The archaic
English statute, passed in witch-burning
times, should be repealed, leaving the
position to be controlled by the modern
Obscene Publications Act. This Act, in
its New South Wales form, provides that
nothing in it is to apply to “literary
works.” The result is that if a published
book answers the description of literature
in the just sense of that word, its author
and publisher will be no more open to
attack than the publishers of “Timon of
Athens” and The Decameron.
I would resist the claim that any
selected individual/whatever his literary
attainments, is qualified to lay down
standards for the community. Indeed, it
can be argued that the very qualifications
for which he is chosen render him un-
typical, and therefore unfitted to speak
for everyone else.
In any event, it has never been shown,
nor can it be shown, that the publishing
of works of fiction which deal frankly
with sex relations and allied matters
cause any harm to anyone. Moral de-
pravity is not the consequence of reading
and study but of habit and conduct.
From Lawson Glassop : —
The suggestion that a board be set up
to deal with censorship questions relating
to books published in Australia will have
the support of all authors who have
writhed under the present ludicrous
system.
The futility of the method now fol-
lowed is shown by several aspects of the
prosecution against the publishers of my
war novel. We Were the Rats.
Mr. Kenneth Binns, a member of the
Commonwealth Literature Censorship
Board, told me how much he enjoyed my
book—but it was banned by the Court.
Most of the text on the three pages on
which the main burden of the police case
rested was extracts from an American
book called Saucy Stories which circu-
lated freely in Australia before the war.
Saucy Stories was allowed into Australia,
but a chapter in We Were the Rats show-
ing the impact of such literature on sex-
starved men at Tobruk, a chapter with a
serious literary purpose, was used as the
basis of a successful prosecution.
If we must have censorship let it be
on the advice of a group of cultured men,
not that of a policeman who thought
Byron might be on Lord Louis Mount-
batten’s staff.
From Brian Elliott : —
The Bulletin’s suggestion of an ex-
pansion of the board may be a very good
one, if that board’s activities are advisory
only. The board should be associated
with the National Library at Canberra,
and should review every book either im-
ported or printed in Australia. At deter-
mined intervals all proscriptions to lapse
unless specifically renewed. Then let the
next step lie with the States, to prosecute.
And let it be the first power of the
prosecuting Court to order a re-examina-
tion of the book by the board, in order
to have specific and up-to-date expert
evidence for consideration. Some such
reform might reconcile present organisa-
tion with reason and also salutarily reduce
censorship by dictatorial decree. Dis-
cretion, if not secrecy, may be a necessary
part of the procedure at some stages, but
it is illogical and obstructive to keep all
decisions from the public. They need not
be broadcast, but they should be available.
As to Part II of this problem, which is
the definition of “obscenity,” it is prob-
ably insoluble. It is doubtful if the gain
in protected propriety is great enough to
warrant censorship at all. But if it is, an
enlightened attitude towards sex is not to
be expected from any board. All boards
compromise (which is why we are allowed
to have Shakspeare and the Bible). Any
such board is expected to sanction the
democratic wish—or prejudice. Sex is,
and (in spite of Freud) will remain, a
taboo. Any board—and the larger the
stolider —is bound to frown on books
which treat- sex freely, experimentally, or
(wowserio modo ) “suggestively.” Any
board might suffice to pronounce whether
Exhibit A is sound according to taboo ;
what board will you get to arbitrate upon
the sacred taboo itself?
My experience in the Ern Malley case
was that the thing lacking was not so
much a matter of administrative forms
as of the vagueness: of the purpose they
served. The magistrate who fined Max
Harris was forced to take his stand by the
definitions of indecency, etc.; and
although “expert evidence” was admitted
(mine among others) it seemed that the
Court was nervous of accepting anything
so merely opiniative and personal; what
it needed was something institutional or
“official,” which would perhaps have let
the magistrate interpret his definitions
somewhat more freely. The fiat of a
board of reference would facilitate this
without destroying the authority and pre-
cedent of law, I think the worst effects
of censorship are a'residue from the ad-
ministration through the Customs;
though possibly overconservative to
satisfy such spirits as Harris, the Courts
are sincere enough, and what is chiefly
needed —as well as but actually more
than administrative reform —is something
to establish the authority of what is some-
what curiously called “expert evidence”:
that is, in effect, literary judgment.
Two Anthologies.
Angus and Robertson’s Australian
Poetry series has had a bad year for
1947; Coast to Coast, its companion
volume of short stories, an exceptionally
good year.
The Poetry, edited by Frederick T.
Macartney, fails on the two grounds
where such an anthology must not fail:
as a book in itself and as an adequate
representation of the year’s work. Mr.
Macartney has omitted, among others,
Robert D. FitzGerald, Francis Webb,
Mary Gilmore and Nancy Keesing.
To leave out writers of this calibre is
not necessarily a fault of editorship ; it
may be an act of courage and a virtue.
And, even if these writers all submitted
poems, and all were of their usual high
standard, there may have been special
reasons for excluding them. Mr.
Macartney seems to have taken a
stand against printing extracts from
long poems: a point of view mis-
taken if the anthology is fairly to
represent the year’s work, but which
could reasonably be argued as a prin-
ciple of editorship. This would explain
the absence of an extract from Francis
Webb’s “Leichhardt Pantomime,” the
outstanding poem of 1947, and, perhaps,
the absence of Robert D. FitzGerald’s
“Fifth Day,” which, though written a
little after the period of the anthology,
might have been available.
But whatever defence may be made for
the omissions, the fact of them remains.
And so the anthology does not justly
represent the Australian poetry of 1947.
It conveys an impression of ' debility,
whereas its predecessors—especially the
volumes edited by Robert D. FitzGerald,
R. G. Howarth and T. Inglis
have shown Australian poetry urgently
alive and growing in weight, strength and
length.
The anthology is bound to vary in
merit from year to year, and it does ap-
pear that Mr. Macartney, once he had
decided to eliminate extracts from long
poems, struck an unfortunate period. The
general standard of writing in 1947 was
not high, and the anthology, like The
Bulletin and the other magazines from
which many of the selections are re-
printed, was to some extent at the mercy
of its contributors.
Mr. Macartney’s judgment, neverthe-
less, might have been more discriminat-
ing. John Blight’s “Becalmed,” for in-
stance, his finest poem to date, marred
only in the last line by his habitual
clumsiness, was well worth including; a
lovely, a strange and altogether a dis-
tinguished piece of work. But Blight’s
“Old Woman Island,” in which the poet
ties himself into a most remarkable
tangle of knots, is, though printable, by
no means one of the outstanding poems
of its year. Writers not so well estab-
lished as John Blight—promising new-
comers or minor lyrists—are given far
more space than has been the practice
of previous editors. And from verses on
this level one descends to at least six
poems among the 30-odd of the volume —
scraps of free verse or pointless analyses
of the present state of the world—which
are elementary in technique or almost
completely lacking in poetic content.
While the doubtful or worthless selec-
tions make the anthology disappointing
simply as a book of verse, irrespective
of its deficiencies as a record of its period,
there are, of course, a number of poems
included that range from mildly pleasing
to excellent. Chief among them are
Judith Wright’s profoundly beautiful
“Woman to Man” and Hugh McCrae’s
mysterious “Lome,” two poems that are
permanent contributions to Australian
literature. Verses up to the anthology’s
usual standard include Kenneth Slessor’s
“Polarities,” Rosemary Dobson’s “Coun-
try Press,” Nan McDonald’s “Trans-
migration,” Ken Barratt’s “Lapdrouse,”
Elizabeth Riddell’s “Under the Casua-
rina,” David Campbell’s “Country Board-
inghouse,” Val Vallis’s “Michael,” Rex
Ingamells’s “Sea-Chronicles” and W.
Hart-Smith’s “The Ship’s Cat.”
To make a corresponding list of the
worth-while stories in Coast to Coast,
1947, edited by Don Edwards, one could
almost reprint the table of contents. Only
two stories, both partly redeemed by a
poetry of earth, fall far below the general
level: E. Dithmack’s “Beautiful White
Duck,” in which a depressed country-
woman identifies herself with the beauti-
ful white duck, illogically and a trifle
absurdly, and Gene McCarthy’s senti-
mental and distressingly uplifting “A
Christmas Rebel.”
George Farwell’s “A Time of Ripen-
ing,” with too much “pulsing sap” in
it, like a landscape painted in coarse and
greasy oils, was very doubtfully worth
inclusion; and Margaret Trist’s “To
Town for the Day” and Arthur Ash-
worth’s “Afternoon” do not advance
beyond the atmospheric sketch —a kind
of writing pleasant as it goes along but
evaporating at the last into its own atmos-
phere.
The volume reaches its, greatest depth
and power in Cecil Mann’s “The River,”
one of those rare short stories in
which prose achieves the concentra-
tion —the single, forcible image—of
a dramatic lyric. For breadth of can-
vas, for comedy and for the full, ripe
flavor of characterisation “in the round”
the most delightful story is Brian James’s
“The Triumph of Mrs. Bolton”; the
somewhat rambling form of which is due
to its being an extract from The Cooka-
bundy Chronicles, which is a rambling
sort of novel and which, incidentally, is
taking as long to appear in book form as
did Such Is Life. Brian James has two
books published and about six others
patiently waiting their day.
John Fountain’s “The Balance,” a
prisoner-of-war drama set in Yugoslavia,
blends the qualities of both these stories,
taking as wide a field as Brian James and,
when the half-caste Salem, “the hawk-
faced young Frenchman from Algiers,”
goes berserk, attaining for a moment the
intensity characteristic of Cecil Mann’s
images of war. It is a story perfect in
form, very fine in its landscapes, strange
and tragic in its characterisation and with
something of Conrad both in its balance
of mind and its touches of wondering
humor.
Coast to Coast, like Australian Poetry,
has had its doldrums: those who care for
Australian literature must be prepared to
support the series as a whole. There have
been issues in which the commonplace,
the merely faithful description of life,
laid a patina of dullness over the volumes.
The 1946 number read like a sort of
Wharfies’ Annual. Don Edwards’s
volume reads like literature.
Not only the three stories already men-
tioned but also Ken Levis’s richly poetic
“Frog Smoke,” J. H. Melville’s “The
Black Hat,” the two stories by Gloria
Rawlinson and the two stories by A. P.
Gaskell, Roderick Finlayson’s delightful
Maori comedy “Johnny Wairua’s
Wonderland” and, as a straightforward
yarn of the sea, R. S. Porteous’s “Con-
fidence,” are likely to be reprinted in
anthologies of the future as stories good
not only for 1947 but for any year. “To
Command the Cats,” though a study of
a lion-tamer should interest anybody who
has ever been to a circus, lacks something
of Geoff Bingham’s characteristic vitality;
anC * Gann’s' “Growing Up in Chad
Street” is loose in form and has the
slightly false plebeian note of the Penguin
New Writing school; but these stories,
too, have quality.
As 3, book in itself, then, Coast to Coast,
1947 is admirable. Asa cover of Aus-
tralian writing for its period? Absentees,
among writers who should have been
available, include Myra Morris, James
Hackston and E. O. Schlunke. There is
another point worth discussing here, a
matter which caused a mild raising of
eyebrows in the “S. M. Herald” review,
in a typically chirpy Sydney “D.T.” article
and also in the valuable inch of space
devoted to the volume by Brisbane
“Courier-Mail”: Don Edwards has
selected as many as six stories by New
Zealand writers.
Since these are all of exceptionally high
quality it is with the greatest reluctance
that one would disagree with the selec-
tion : when all is said and done, it is only
art that matters, and these stories are
works of art. Better a Coast to Coast
given up entirely to New Zealanders than
a dull anthology. But perhaps, in what
is essentially an Australian enterprise,
Don Edwards should have published, say,
two of Brian James’s stories to one of
Gloria Rawlinson’s, two of Cecil Mann’s
to one of A. P. Gaskell’s, instead of, as
he has, the reverse.
The principle of including New Zealand
stories in Coast to Coast is, however, a
good one ; it was established at the begin-
ning, and it should be continued. -One
may pass over the benefit to New Zealand
writers, who have no similar anthology of
their own, as not strictly relevant. It is
the benefit to Australian literature that
concerns us. If we exclude the writings
of our neighbors across the Tasman then
we can never justly complain—as we do—
that Australian writing is, with rare ex-
ceptions, shut out of England. New
Zealand writing can be to Australia what
the Irish, Scottish and Welsh movements
have in turn been to England: the ex-
pression of a neighboring and an allied
culture from which our own, if we are *
wise, can continually take vigor and
variety.
Don Edwards’s New Zealanders should
be welcome in Coast to Coast; and, in-
deed, if Australian poetry has fallen off
in quality to the extent which would
appear from Mr. Macartney’s selection, it
would be as well to invite contributions
to that series also from the four or five
New Zealanders who matter. Whatever
nationalistic objections might be raised,
Coast to Coast and Australian Poetry are
only worth preserving while their contents
are of the highest standard.
S.
Maurice Ravel: Roland - Manuel
(Ponsford, Newman and Benson)! A
biography which dredges the diction-
ary for every possible superlative. The
author sees music only through French
eyes and Ravel only through one. The
blame for the failure as a ballet of
“Daphnis and Chloe” is placed, not on
Ravel’s music, but on the “miscalculated”
choreography of Fokine.

The Reach of the Mind: Dr. J. B.
Rhine (Faber), “It is shocking but
true,” says the author, “that we know the
atom today better than we know the
mind that knows the atom.” Rhine and
his associates at Duke University, North
Carolina, have for years been trying to
find out, by practical scientific research,
what the mind can do in the way of tele-
pathy and clairvoyance. In this book, in
addition to describing further (rafiier
dull) experiments in those subjects, he
has a chapter, of singular interest for
players of two-up, on the ability of the
mind to exert influence on matter—in
particular, to control the fall of dice.

The Commonwealth securities
listed on the right either matured
and ceased earning interest on
September 15 or will do so on
October 15. The information
given below tells holders of these (
Bonds and Inscribed Stock how
to convert their maturing securi-
ties into the Sixth Security Loan
and thereby prevent any interrup-
tion to interest payments on their
investments.
If you have lodged with your bank for
safe custody more than £lO worth of
any of the securities listed above, right,
you should have received a letter from
the Prime Minister, accompanied by a
folder explaining how your securities
may be converted.
Cash Subscriptions Also Invited
Investment in the Sixth Security
Loan is not confined to those with
maturing securities to convert.
Everyone may buy Bonds for
cash or by instalments (for £lO,
£5O, £lOO, £5OO or £1,000), or
Inscribed Stock, through any
Bank, Savings Bank, Money
Order Post Office or Stockbroker.
Interest is payable each six
months, at 3i% P er annum for
fourteen years. Repayment in
full at maturity is guaranteed by
the Commonwealth.
Save for Security —invest to-day
in the Sixth Security Loan.
If you have not received such a letter,
check the maturity dates of your securi-
ties in one of the following ways:
1. if your Bonds ore in your own
possession. Look at them at once and
compare the maturity date printed at
the top with those shown in the list
above.
2. If you lodged your Bonds with
your bonk for safe keeping. Most
banks issue a receipt or acknowledg-
ment for Bonds left with them for safe
custody. If you hold any such receipts,
compare the maturity dates shown with
the list above.
3. If you cannot discover maturity
dates. Go to your bank to-day and ask
whether they hold for you any of the
securities listed above.
HOW TO CONVERT
If you find that your securities have
matured or are about to mature, ask
your bank or stockbroker for an appli-
cation form for conversion into the
Sixth Security Loan. Fill in one form
for each series of Bonds or £tock
maturing and hand it back. That’s all.
You will then possess Sixth Security
Loan Bonds or Inscribed Stock of the
same value as your maturing securities,
and interest on your securities will
continue.

What was the Louisiana Purchase?
The transaction completed in 1803
whereby the United States purch"sed
from Napoleon for 15 million dollars
a vast tract of land west of the Missis-
sippi containing 1,171,931 square
miles, or an area greater than that of
the 13 original States. The bargain
was a great one for America. It not
only precluded all possibility of a
foreign Power getting a foothold on
the lower Mississippi; it also secured
control of the great river.

Some information about the two
feudatory chiefships of Hunza and
Nagar in India ?
They are two small States on the
north-west frontier of Kashmir for-
merly under the administration of the
Gilgit agency. The two States are in-
habited generally by people of the
same stock, speaking the same lan-
guage, professing the same form of
the Mohammedan religion, and ruled
by princes sprung from the same
family, though frequently at war with
each other. Formerly Hunza was the
more prominent of the two, because
it held possession of the passes lead-
ing to the Pamirs, and could plunder
the caravans on their way between
Turkistan and India. But they are
both shut up in a recess of the moun-
tains, and were of no importance until
about 1889, following the establish-
ment of the Gilgit agency, the occupa-
tion of Chitral, and the Hunza ex-
pedition which asserted British author-
ity over Hunza and Nagar. Popula-
tion of Hunza in 1931 was 13,141 and
of Nagar 13,672.

What uses are made in industry of
(1) titanium oxide, and (2) zirconium
oxide ?
(1) k is used in high-class paints,
enamels, lacquers and in printing ink;
as a filler for all kinds of high-grade
paper, window shades, oilcloth and
linoleum; the coloring of rubber; and
as a glaze in shock-resisting glass,
ceramics and false teeth. (2) Its uses
cover a very large field, among which
is a non-poisonous, non-discoloring
paint in great demand for baking
enamels or steel and iron utensils.
It is superior to other products, as it
is resistant to vegetable or fruit acids.
It is also in demand for pottery,
glazing, glassware and for accelerating
the vulcanising of rubber.

THE NEW HOUSE
By
CTEOFF BINGHAM
CRESSWELL SOUTHBANK is an
imposing name, and especially for
a dairyfarmer, but Cresswell him-
self was unimposing, except, per-
haps, in the mental sense, and then only
in relation to the New House, since it,
in itself, served to lift him out of the rut
of the ordinary.
There must be something in the old
contention that a man gains poise and
personality from a house. The New
House, so far as Cresswell was concerned,
came quite naturally into existence, and in
the same natural manner did its owner
gather dignity about him.
At first there was the old house. It
had been, since the beginning of the
pioneers on the North Coast, a single
hip-roofed room which was added to by
a skillion built on the northern side, after
which the generations of Southbanks
made it imperative that skillions were
added also to the east, west and south.
When I saw it last it was still remarkably
preserved. True, a regiment or two of
white-ants had attacked it at. several
points, but the same regiment had with-
drawn from the toughened hardwoods,
disappointed and discomfited.
The Southbanks had continued to live
in it with a reasonable degree of comfort,
and a generation or two might have fol-
lowed had not Tim, the only son, with-
drawn to the equally ancient terraces of
Redfern, and Mrs. Cress suddenly com-
plained about the wind through the slab-
cracks and the unlined skillions.
She contended, and quite rightly, that
thirty years of milking cows, picking
beans and peas and packing tomatoes
should have the reward of a little, com-
fort. Besides, there was the money Cress
had made from the milk and the vege-
tables —a fact Cress did not bother to deny.
The idea once planted in Cress’s head,
it grew. The gaps in the sawn timber
set his head nodding more, and the frosty
draughts of winter made him decide,
firmly, to commence building in the
spring. Also, building did away with the
necessity for renewing the guttering,
patching the roofing above the bath, and
lining the house throughout. Decidedly
it would be better to build a new house.
It was here Cress’s personality seemed
to come to life, and he changed from the
staid farmer to a man with a hobby,
and an enthusiasm which, when fed, be-
came little less than an obsession.
There were the plans. No more grow-
ing like Topsy, Cress set out each Satur-
day for Burtville, where he was wel-
comed by his town cronies, some of
them old farmers, others business friends.
They took him to their homes, and to
the homes of their friends. They in-
dulged in heated discussions upon the un-
suitability of bedroom doors opening on
space economy and area economy and
to vestibules, and argued endlessly about
the like, all perfectly intelligible to Cress,
who, by now, was too far involved to
withdraw, had he desired to do so.
AFTER the plans the builder, and in
those days there was no shortage of
builders. They. practically begged for
jobs, but not after Cress had had inter-
views with them. From being closeted
with him they withdrew, chastened and
weary men, and only Bill Toogood, of
all, emerged triumphant, which was prob-
ably because Bill had commenced life as
a farmer, and knew how to handle Cress.
The timber had already been selected,
milled and weathered. Tallowwoods for
the floor, and none of your softwoods
anywhere. Red mahoganv for the studs
and the joints and the lining, flooded-
gums for interior finishes and blackbutt
for the weatherboards, every stick of it
hauled from Cress’s property to Sam
Flannigan’s mill by the station. All this
Bill Toogood noted with satisfaction.
It was afterwards that Bill Toogood
told his Burtville friends that he had no-
thing against old Cresswell, not exactly,
anyway, and they weren’t to blame the
old fellow. He had his ideas, just as
everyone had his own ideas, and he wasn’t
saying it was Cress’s fault, but then these
cockies could be obstinate if they liked,
even about joists and studs and stays.
“Mortise this and mitre that,” mifnicked
Bill. “You’d ’a’ thought I’d never handled
a chisel or a jackplane in me life.
“So I left him,” said Bill, with evi-
dent satisfaction. “And he needn’t think
he’ll get another.”
Many also wondered how Cress South-
bank would finish that house. I did,
myself, and at week-ends when I returned
from the city I would stare at the new
construction, unfinished, on Cress’s hill,
just above the old house. Then one
week-end I saw the rafters were on, and
some weatherboards, and from that time
onwards the house took shape. Then it
was finished almost, the gleaming iron
on the roof, the place snug in yellow
weatherboards and gaping only where it
remained for windows and doors to be
fitted. It had a solid appearance, an aif
of complete prosperity, reflected, no
doubt, from the years of Cress’s successful
farming. Finished and painted, it would
easily take pride of place among Burt-
vilie’s farm homes.,
BUT Cresswell seemed in no hurry to
finish that house. At least, so it
seemed to me, for it was then I made his
better acquaintance. He wanted me to
get him a kitchen, sink from the city,
which I did. Then he needed a new
bath, and I was able to get that. Each
week-end I would bring him numerous
bundles containing special varnishes and
stains, plane-blades, chisels and sand-
paper, and Cress would always press me
to inspect the progress of the building,
and there was, indeed, a fascination in
seeing that house near absolute comple-
tion.
Mrs. Cress, a quiet middle-aged woman
with a calm face and pale-blue eyes,
never showed much enthusiasm, not the
same degree, anyway, as did Cress. Some-
times she would smile with a sort of
patient resignation, as though not be-
lieving the house would ever be finished.
The gadgets Cress bought to relieve the
drudgery of housework rarely evoked a
response. She viewed them with equani-
mity. I had, often, a faint suspicion
that they both believed the house could
not be completed.
It seemed to me impossible that any
day the house would not be finished, but
that was because I knew so little about
a house. I did not know how long it
takes to swing just one door, what there
is in plumbing, running a drain from a
kitchen, and providing septic sewerage.
Sometimes, too, even then it was difficult
to obtain certain materials. Also, there
were the alterations, the addition of a
servery between kitchen and dining-room,
and the provision of a chute to the
laundry for soiled clothes. The elec-
trician had his hold-ups, too, when Cress
wanted a power-point shifted, or light
connections altered to. allow for con-
cealed illumination.
Even then, you would say, a house is
bound to get itself finished in time, so
that it may be lived in. I thought time
would defeat Cress, and so did Burtville,
but we did not correctly estimate Cress
and the house. The house inspired some
peculiar love in the old fellow. Meet
him in Burtville and mention the house
and his eyes would light up, his expression
alter, and he would say, “Ah, yes, just
got to put the bathroom sink in and
she’s finished.”
There would be only the slightest hint
of regret, but you could see, also, that
he never believed the bathroom sink
would complete the job, I think he must
have believed that to finish it would end
a unique experience. He was the owner
of two houses, one old and the other
new.. When the new was completed the
old would have to be dismantled, and
then the new would be a home, as all new
buildings are doomed to become.
I think Mrs. Cress might have become
bitter but for her lifelong patience.
Nevertheless, she must have been upset
when Cress, inspired by some advertise-
ment, decided that corrugated - iron
should be replaced by tiles. However,
even this operation could not delay the
inevitable, and one day Cress began mov-
ing furniture from the old house to the
new.
But Cress escaped his doom. Difficult
it is to believe a new house could be
burned so easily and so quickly, and yet
it happened when the furniture was
almost removed from the old house. Cress
himself was in Burtville on the night it
happened, buying palings from Flanni-
gan for the new fence, and the fire-
brigade heard before he did, but they
were not effective, and the house was
burned nearly to the ground. There were
a few pieces of timber saved, and the
brick piles were still there.
It was the first piece of news I heard
when I got off the train. I went to Cress’s
farm and did not dare to call on him. I
could see the ruins from the road. How-
ever, that night I had an impulse to see
him, but when I walked up to the old
house he was not about. Nor was Mrs.
Cress, since they did not have any furni-
ture. I found Cress at the ruins of his
fine home and did not quite know what
to say.
I must admit I was filled with that de-
sire to console, an emotion which is
always mixed with some sense of satis-
faction on contemplating ruin, probably
the profoundest feeling within the human
soul, and so I was naturally disappointed
when Cress did not seem saddened, or
even slightly embittered. Nevertheless, I
said, with an evangelical gentleness,
“Hard luck, Cress.”
“Yes,” he said. He grunted a bit. “Of
course.”
Then he asked me, suddenly, “Know
anything about insurances?”
“Just a little,” I told him. “Can I
help?”
“Well, it was insured,” he said.
“Thank God!” I said.
He viewed this emotional outburst with
surprise. “Well insured,” he said. “What
worries me is that the policy was in the
fire.”
“That mightn’t matter,” I told him.
“Just hold you up for a short time,”
We stared at the ruins. As moonlight
became brilliant over them I had the
strange feeling that it did not much
matter. “It was a wonderful house,” I
said.
“It was,” Cress agreed warmly. He
seemed to be thinking about bathroom
tiles, walnut panelling and flooded-gum
architraves, so holy was the light in his
eyes.
I felt sorry for him as I left. He
seemed a lone figure standing, pondering
over the rubble of his former home. And,
of course, there was the insurance.
I think he came out well enough on the
insurance. I moved south from Burt-
ville about that time and never fully
heard the facts, but I believe the insur-
ance company came good, except, of
course, on the furniture, which had not
been insured. However, it was old stuff
and did not much matter, and may have
looked quite out of place in that new
house.
Mrs. Cress, I believe, made her hus-
band buy new furniture. She shifted
back into the old house and probably re-
signed herself to the old style of comfort,
shrunken slabs and all.
DUT Cress was changed. The new
' house had altered him. I believe it
was only a matter of weeks before he
began the new house, this time without
Bill Toogood. For all I know he is still
building it, although, you would say, he
must surely be finished by now. I have
the strange feeling, however, that it is as
it was before, and although I do not be-
lieve Cress burned down his own home,
I can easily visualise him, every evening,
finishing his meal, helping Mrs. Cress
with the dishes and then taking a stroll
to the hill to the unfinished new house.
His excellent lighting always showed
white ceilings and panelled walls to per-
fection, and these old Cress is sure to
inspect with immense satisfaction, gently
tempered by Mrs. Cress’s evening meal.
Probably, on inspecting the bathroom, he
will decide a hot-water system is needed,
and his mind will be filled with thoughts
of labor-saving devices, all intended for
the better comfort of Mrs. Cress, now
seated in the old house, and fine enough
they will be if ever they are installed and
the house completed and the old couple
move into the new house, away from the
doubtful comfort of old slabs and
corrugated-iron roofing.
WOMBAT.
The black swans’ convoy,
Their wake dark-damascened
Upon the steel-blue bladed river,
Leads to the tide-dim bay, leaves us
for ever.
Swan-piloted between the day and dark
Small Wombat goes,
Into the last of sun,
Her riding light a rose.
For the first swan and the last liner, dark,
Edged with the light of courage, swings
the day
Into enchantment.
Night for the first barque
Tarred and full-seasoned, made her ship’s
beauty an emprise,
Tide-wind-acco utred.
There is greatness born •
On every sea with any nightfall still.
And all earth’s wandering ships below
the sill
Of the dipped horizon weather out in
names
The fatal years that lost, them :
Argosy,
VICTORIA.
Oars banked like fires smouldering in
the sea;
Santa Maria of the gilded prow
Dividing new worlds from old with weed-
fouled cutwater,
Freighting strange, riches to that obstinate
man
Columbus (yet Spain’s unloved greatest
son );
And Lightning, canvas-crammed and
driving on
Full-bellied, moon-raked, shrouds that
meshed the stars,
Her ratlines pearled in sun, night-fanged
in ice,
Still is a blaze of beauty to men’s minds,
Though long burnt hulk-black in Corio
Bay.
And greatness comes home
To Perth or Sydney town
When ships which bear that name
In the far seas drown.
But since no man has courage
Save in small truth, he knows —
I’ll sail for night in Wombat,
Her riding-light a rose.
MARY FINNIN.
HARBOR MORNING.
All night, outside the mind the room’s
thick darkness,
The shadowy gleam of the mirror, that
the dead
Haunt dimly with their glances, clear
eyes blind now
In the rotting earth ... the clock that
woke with a start.
Gathering its rattling bones to strike on
the ears
The lead-tong hours...and the weight
pressed on the heart,
The pillow hot under the aching head.
Damp with the slow, salt bitterness of
tears.
Inside the mind the strong deep river
flowing
Out of the country lost beyond return ;
All night the drowned flowers and the
green leaves floating
Recalled that wild, bright mountain land
— oh, to hear.
Only once more, its stabbing ecstasy
Of birdsong; once, the babbling fall of
clear
Water on great smooth stones and glit-
tering fern !
And against the current, moving steadily,
The rising tide’s salt, sullen bitterness
N.S.W.
Smelling of shipwreck and the strangling
weed,
The horror of the depths, the shoreless
sea.
But at last dawn, within, without, and
now
Only the cool light of a gusty day —
Now, heavy head, the fresh grey sea
wind blowing!
Look, hot eyes, look, how the tough dark
native trees
And ragged palms ashore tackle the low
And flying clouds! How the steep,
mounting seas
Dash on the rocks, how the white fans
of spray
Burst from the plunging bows, drench
bucking decks —
No past, no future now, only flood tide.
Then sing, as down the air old sorrows
blow
And laugh to see hung out the black
gale warning —
O faithless heart! that always so amazed
Finds the night past, the holy word
fulfilled,
The joy, the joy that cometh in the

DUNLOP RUBBER AUSTRALIA LIMITED
CHAIRMAN’S SPEECH
ANNUAL MEETING, 24th SEPTEMBER, 1948
Ladies and Gentlemen,
At the Annual General Meeting last year it
was my sad duty to acquaint you with the fact
that shortly after the completion of the financial
year our Chairman and General Manager, Mr.
W. A. Bartlett, passed away after a short and
unexpected illness. He had served the Company
in a very distinguished manner since his original
appointment in 1935 as General Manager, and
from 1944 as a Director of the Company.
As successor to Mr. Bartlett your Directors
appointed Professor R. R. Blackwood, M.C.E.,
8.E.E., M.I.E. Aust., Dean of the Faculty of
Engineering in the University of Melbourne.
Mr. Blackwood, prior to his acceptance of the
Chair of Mechanical Engineering, had com-
pleted fourteen years’ service with the Company
on the manufacturing side of the business, and
was for nearly ten years Technical Manager,
responsible for the technical control of produc-
tion and design of the Company’s products.
Your Board felt that a technical manufacturing
industry such as ours should be under the con-
trol of a senior executive with a sound technical
background, and in Mr. Blackwood we feel
that we have a General Manager who meets
this requirement and who has, in addition, a
wide knowledge of the Rubber Industry in par-
ticular, both here and overseas.
Mr. R. H. Simkin, formerly Sales Manager
for Australia, has been appointed to the posi-
tion of Assistant General Manager. Mr. Sim-
kin has completed 37 years’ service with the
Company on the Sales side of the business, and
has a wide knowledge of the distribution and
merchandising of the Company’s products. In
his position as Assistant General Manager Mr.
Simkin will still be responsible for sales and
distribution.
Your Board recognises that the Parent Com-
pany and’ its several subsidiaries have now
grown to a stage where the co-ordination of
the Financial operations of the group should
be-the responsibility of a single senior executive.
Accordingly, the Directors have appointed Mr.
E. E. Dunshea as General Secretary of the Con-
solidated Companies to undertake the work.
Mr. Dunshea has served the Company for 27
years on the statistical, accounting and secre-
tarial side, and brings to his new position a wide
experience of the Financial side of the business.
Your Directors feel that in these three senior
appointments they have selected a properly
balanced management team well versed in all
aspects of the Company’s operations, and they
are confident that the management of the Com-
pany is in the capable hands of men who will
ensure continued progress.
GENERAL
During the financial year under review your
Company has manufactured and marketed goods
to the value of £7,553,000. This is the greatest
annual turnover yet achieved. That it has been
achieved in spite of the difficulties of obtaining
vital raw materials and in spite of the dearth
of available labour is all the more remarkable,
and reflects great credit on all members of the
organisation. It has been possible because
of the continued loyalty, enthusiasm and team-
work of every employee in the Company’s
service.
On January Ist last the forty-hour week was
introduced into industry generally. This neces-
sitated increased expenditure in penalty rates to
maintain a normal production level. Con-
currently with the introduction of the forty-
hour week a new Rubber Workers’ award was
made providing for substantial increases in
award rates. In addition, normal quarterly ad-
justments in the basic wage have increased rates
generally. The net effect of these changes has
been to increase direct labour costs throughout
the organisation by an average of 31 per cent,
during the financial year. Owing to the limited
period of its operation, the effect of the forty-
hour week on future costs of production has
not yet been fully assessed.
During the period under review the cost of
our principal basic raw materials has also in-
creased. Sterling rubber prices have advanced
from 9£d. per lb. as at 30th June, 1947, to
13£d. per lb. as at 30th June, 1948, an advance
of 38 per cent. Cotton and rayon tyre cord
prices have advanced over the same period by
3 per cent.
Your Company has been able to absorb in-
creasing labour and raw material costs only by
increased efficiency of its production methods,
by close attention to the most economical use
of basic raw materials in the design of its pro-
ducts and by careful buying of its raw material
requirements under the difficult conditions
associated with today’s sellers’ market. Our
production, technical and purchasing staffs have
rendered great service to the Company in these
vital matters, and your Board wishes to place
on record its appreciation of their efforts.
Under these circumstances the net profit for
the year of £535,814 represents a very satis-
factory trading result. This figure is £25,984
greater than last year, and is the highest net
profit attained by the Company since the
financial year 1928-29, when a record net profit
of £549,931 was shown. It must be remembered,
however, that at that time the heavy incidence
of taxation under which ail Companies labour
today did not apply.
Although the value of goods produced by the
Company was a record we are, nevertheless, as
yet unable to meet the needs of all our cus-
tomers. The backlog of production accumu-
lated dining the war period has not yet been
overtaken, except in a few minor lines. Further,
the increase in consumer demand for our pro-
ducts, which has taken place since 1939 as a
result of the industrial and agricultural de-
velopment of the country, calls for a production
level much higher than that of pre-war years.
With the limited labour available therefore, it
has been necessary to continue to concentrate
production on those products of greatest
national importance. First priority has been
given to tyres and tubes, and in particular truck
tyres and agricultural tractor tyres. Industrial
needs for belting, hose and similar products
have also been recognised as of prime import-
ance, and continued attention has been paid
to the production of industrial footwear. We
have not been able to resume nftnufacture of
a considerable number of miscellaneous pro-
ducts that we produced pre-war, and produc-
tion of goods of lesser importance has had to
be severely restricted. Under the present diffi-
cult conditions your Directors feel that the
concentration on production of goods of an
essential nature is the correct policy to adopt.
FINANCIAL
I am pleased to submit for your approval and
adoption the Directors’ Report, Balance Sheet
and Profit and Loss Accoqnt for the year ended
30th June last.
As I have already indicated, the turnover for
the year was £7,553,000, and the net profit for
the year is £535,814.
This profit has been arrived at after pro-
viding for Depreciation on Fixed Assets of
£170,181, Directors’ Fees of £3,317 and making
necessary provision for taxation.
Your Directors have already approved a
half-yearly dividend of 5 per cent, on Prefer-
ence shares and 3£ per cent, on Ordinary shares,
and they recommend for your approval final
dividends of 5 per cent, and 4? per cent,
respectively, making 10 per cent, on Preference
shares and 8 per cent, on Ordinary shares for
the year. These dividends require an amount of
£394,252.
The balance brought forward into the ac-
counts from 1946-47 is £51,964, and it is recom-
mended that £140,000 be placed in Reserves,
leaving £53,526 to be carried forward into next
year’s accounts.
During the year an amount of £36,308 has
been debited direct to Reserve for Con-
tingencies. This represents premiums paid in
the purchase of shares in subsidiary companies
during the year. Your Directors recommend
that this Reserve be maintained by tire transfer
of £40,000 from the year’s trading, bringing the
account to £611,820.
The General Reserve has not been increased
for a number of years, and your Directors
recommend that this Reserve should now be in-
creased to £530,000 by the transfer of £50,000
from the year’s trading profit in order to main-
tain the relationship between this Reserve and
the volume of business being transacted by the
Company.
Shareholders will recall that at the Annual
Meeting held on the 15th September, 1944, your
Chairman, the late Rt. Hon. W. A. Watt, an-
nounced the creation of a new Reserve known
as the “Development and Deferred Expenditure
Reserve.” This Reserve was created with an
amount of £250,000. At the time of its intro-
duction your Chairman explained the purpose
for which this Reserve was created. It was set
up to provide special funds for the replace-
ment of plant and machinery subject to ab-
normal usage and minimum maintenance during
the war period and to provide special funds for
the re-establishment of manufacturing opera-
tions on a sound basis in the early post-war
period. The time has now come when we shall
commence to use this Reserve. Replacement
plant, which has been on order for a consider-
able period, is now coming to hand, and a
considerable amount of this new equipment
will be installed during the coming year. Since
the time that this Deferred Expenditure Reserve
was created, however, costs of plant and equip-.
ment, building additions and alterations and
engineering work generally have very materially
increased. In order to meet this unavoidable
increase in costs, your Directors recommend
that the Development and Deferred Expenditure
Reserve be increased to £300,000 by the transfer
of £50,000 from the year’s trading profit.
The Reserve for inter-company profits in stock
valuations of the' Consolidated Companies has
increased from £15,507 to £23,901 in line with
the expanding sales volume of the group as a
whole.
The Surplus and Reserves now total
£1,519,247, as compared with £1,405,599 last
year.
The amount owing to Creditors is £487,509
as compared with £435,210 last year. This is a
normal figure and bears a normal relationship
to our volume of trade.
On the Assets side of the Balance Sheet the
Fixed Assets of the Company show an increase
of £198,938 to £1,782,101, after writing out of-
profits an amount for depreciation of £170,181.
Stocks on Hand are higher by an amount of
£790,035, and stand at £2,644,893. It has been
necessary during the year to purchase the bulk
of our cotton requirements and all our rayon
tyre cord requirements abroad, mainly from
the dollar area. In view of the world shortage
of cotton and rayon tyre cords in particular,
and the uncertainty and irregularity of delivery
dates from overseas, your Directors have
thought it prudent to increase our holding of
these raw materials to ensure continuity of pro-
duction. Although natural rubber production is
at present capable of meeting current demands,
nevertheless, the 'delays that occur in delivery
due to shipping troubles, coupled with the dis-
turbing conditions that prevail today in Malaya,
the major rubber producing country, must be
given due consideration, and here again your
Directors have considered it wise to increase our
holding of rubber and latex stocks. At this
time last year our rubber stocks were at> times
barely sufficient to maintain production, but at
the present time we are holding a six months’
stock pile of rubber bought at advantageous
prices. This stock is sufficient to ensure con-
tinuity of output.
Your Directors consider these increases in
stock holding to be vital and necessary for the
safe conduct of our business under present con-
ditions, although the purchase of this stock has
placed us in debit with our Bankers by an
amount of £303,472, whereas last year’s balance
sheet showed us in credit by £134,154.
Trade and Sundry Debtors at £1,144,922,
show an increase of £151,096, a reflection of
the increased volume of sales.
Before leaving the financial side I would
like to draw your attention to the fact that
Current Assets of £3,826,441 exceed Current
Liabilities and Provisions of £1,373,389 by
£2,453,052. I feel sure Shareholders will agree
that the Company’s liquid position is extremely
sound, and that with total Assets now standing
at £8,269,051, the Company stands on a firm
financial foundation.
TYRE PRODUCTION
During the year first priority has been given
to the production of tyres of all types. Pro-
duction at both Drummoyne and Montague
factories has continued at the highest level
possible with existing equipment yid available
labour. In spite of this, however, we have been
unable to meet the demands of the market, par-
ticularly in truck tyres and agricultural tractor
tyres. The number of commercial vehicles
registered in Ausrtalia as at 31st March, 1948,
was 364,298, as compared with 224,727 as at
30th June, 1939. This is an increase of 62 per
cent, over the immediate pre-war period. There
has been an equally phenomenal increase in
the number of agricultural tractors in use in
the country, and further large quantities will be
imported during the coming year. Your manage-
ment is fully conscious of the increased market
for truck and tractor tyres implied by these
figures, and steps have been taken to install
more manufacturing plant to meet the country’s
requirements. It is hoped during the coming
year that both truck and tractor tyre produc-
tion will be considerably increased.
The demand for passenger tyres is gradually
being met, but tyres for fitment to the large
number of outmoded vehicles still of necessity
in use are still in short supply. The heavy im-
portation of small British types and the re-
stricted importation of normal American types
has brought about a complete change in the
relative requirements of the market in different
sizes of tyre, and has necessitated production
changes to meet the growing demand for the
smaller sizes used on British cars.
With the influx of new vehicles of all types
there has been a very heavy demand for original
equipment tyres from assembly plants. Your
Company has endeavoured to meet this demand
to the best of its ability, but it has also recog-
nised the needs of the replacement market and
has endeavoured to distribute its available pro-
duction between both equipment and replace-
ment buyers throughout the Commonwealth in
as equitable a manner as possible.
Your Company was the first to market rayon
truck tyres in this country on a commercial
scale. The service performance of these tyres
has been phenomenal, and all critical sizes of
truck tyres continue to be made in rayon. Un-
fortunately, the supply position does not yet
permit all truck tyres to be made in rayon, but
this will be done as soon as rayon tyre cord
becomes freely available.
The new Super “90” pattern tyres introduced
on the market by your Company last year have
proved to be an outstanding advance in tyre
design, and their all-round performance is un-
equalled in this country. This design' is now
available in truck and bus balloon types and in
the passenger range in standard balloon and
cushion types. The Super “90” cushion tyre is
a newly developed wide section low pressure
tyre to meet the requirements of next year’s
American models.
MECHANICAL RUBBER GOODS
The demand for mechanical rubber goods of
all types has remained at a high level. Our
production of mechanical hose of all types has
been maintained at four times the pre-war level.
The market requirements for transmission and
conveyor belts and industrial V-belts has con-
tinued to exceed our ability to supply. Here
again we are planning the installation of more
equipment to increase our output of transmis-
sion and conveyor belting at Montague, and a
new factory has been brought into operation
during the year at Bendigo, where production
is confined exclusively to industrial V-belts.
Production at this latter plant will be very con-
siderably increased during the coming year to
meet the increased demand. At the same time,
the development of this plan will relieve some
of the pressure at our Montague plant and
enable the production there of other lines to be
expanded.
FOOTWEAR
Great strides have been made in re-establish-
ing our footwear production at Drummoyne
Factory, but the lack of adequate female labour
is proving a handicap. It is hoped to transfer
some of this production to a new factory
approaching completion at Bankstown, N.S.W.,
where labour is more available. This move will
also relieve the pressure, at our Drummoyne
plant and enable the production of- mechanical
lines to be expanded there.
At the present time, the demand for Welling-
ton boots is greatly above the pre-war level,
both for agricultural purposes and for construc-
tional work. Here again, we have been unable
to meet the demand in spite of increased •pro-
duction. Steps have been taken to step up
production still further in an effort to supply
the country’s needs. In the meantime, these
goods are being distributed by the Company
throughout the Commonwealth on as equitable
a basis as possible.
SPORTS GOODS
Last year I reported the completion of a
modern factory at Beverly Hills, N.S.W., for
the production of tennis racquets. I am pleased
to report that the planned production has now
been reached, and this modern unit is functioning
very efficiently. Our “Maxply” racquet con-
tinues to hold its place as the best on the
market and incorporates several patented features
not available anywhere else in the world.
Manufacture of natural gut tennis strings by
our subsidiary, Bentley Bros. Pty., Ltd., has
been limited only by the available supply of
raw materials. Bentley strings still maintain
their supremacy for quality.
The manufacture of golf balls has been con-
siderably expanded since January last, when the
Company commenced operations at a small
factory at Frankston, Victoria, Production of
our “65” golf ball is now above pre-war level.
Dunlop lawn bowls continue to be in heavy
demand and production continues to the limit
of our capacity.
CLOTHING
. Operation of our Weatherproof Factory at
Wagga, N.S.W., continues to justify our de-
cision to decentralise this section of our busi-
ness. Production is limited only by the avail-
ability of raw materials and semi-processed
rubberised fabrics produced at Drummoyne
Factory.
In the year under review we have commenced
manufacturing operations at a small unit at
Bankstown, N.S.W., which is producing high-
quality sports trousers. Production of these
and other allied lines will be increased during
the coming year, when a larger factory, now
under construction at Bankstown, becomes
available.
The popularity of the chemically treated
Weatherproof coat produced by our subsidiary,
Dunlop Weatherproofs Australia Pty., Limited,
has become so marked that we have now taken
steps to increase our output considerably. These
garments made from worsted covert cloth pro-
duced in Australia are made to a very high
standard of quality and in cut and style are
equal to anything produced elsewhere. Your
Company has made satisfactory arrangements
to ensure adequate supplies of covert cloth of
the highest quality for the manufacture of these
garments.
DUNLOPILLO PRODUCTS
Our subsidiary, Latex Products Pty., Ltd.,
has made marked progress during the year.
The demand for Dunlopillo products, particu-
larly hospital mattresses and transport seating,
continues at a high level. Priority has been
given in production to these items, although
we have been able to handle a considerable
amount of theatre seating and lounge furniture
during the year.
Immediately aftar the war the plant at
Montague for the, manufacture of the basic
Dunlopillo units was redesigned and modernised.
Today it produces at twice the pre-war rate of
output. This year \ye have brought into
operation a similar plant at Drummoyne. These
two plants have enabled us to increase output
very considerably above the pre-war level. New
premises at the Latex Products factory at
Annandale, Sydney, have been completed and
are now being used for production. We in-
tend shortly to erect a factory unit at Sand-
ringham, Victoria, to extend the activities of
this subsidiary to meet the increasing demand
for mattresses, transport upholstery and other
allied products. Your Directors anticipate that
the strong demand for these products will
continue to expand and a considerably greater
volume of business is anticipated ip the coming
year.
BATTERIES
Our subsidiary. Battery Manufacturers Pty.,
Ltd., continues to produce Dunlop batteries at
its Waterloo factory in Sydney, These batteries
have been well received by the trade and our
subsidiary is now one of the leading producers
of batteries in the Commonwealth. Last year
I announced that a new factory for battery
manufacture would be erected on a site acquired
at Sandringham, Victoria. I am pleased to
announce this year that the factory is almost
completed, that machinery and plant is already
installed, and that production has already com-
menced. This factory will undoubtedly be the
country’s most modern battery-producing unit,
and some of the machinery installed is of very
advanced design.
FLOORING
Our subsidiary, Dunlop Scmtex Pty., Ltd.,
has now completed its first full year of operation.
This subsidiary was formed to handle all types
of rubber and allied flooring and to provide a
flooring service to customers. The subsidiary
has concerned itself mainly with developmental
work on Semtex fleximer-type industrial floor-
ing, and considerable quantities of this type
of flooring have been laid in spite of the
shortage of some of the essential raw materials.
1 am pleased to announce that Semtex Mastic
Tiles are now being marketed by this subsidiary
and will shortly be available in quantity. This
type of flooring is attractive, long wearing, and
easily maintained, and should find an extensive
market for use on rigid sub-floors. That Dunlop
Semtex has completed its first year of operation
and passed through its early developmental
stages and at the same time shown a small
profit on its operations, reflects great credit
on.the staff and employees of that organisation.
YoUr Directors are confident that this section
of our business will grow tp be of considerable
importance.
DECENTRALISATION
For many years the Company’s main centres
of production have been at Drummoyne,
N.S.W., and Montague, Victoria. The Com-
pany’s heavy plant for the manufacture of tyres
and tubes, belting and hose, is located in these
two factories, as well as lighter plant for the
manufacture of a wide variety of rubber pro-
ducts. In order to increase the output of tyres
and mechanical goods at these factories where
the heavy plant is available, it has become
necessary to transfer the production of some
lines elsewhere. Since the time is not yet oppor-
tune to develop the original Beaumaris scheme,
your Directors have felt that in transferring
certain items of manufacture from Montague
and Drummoyne, that a general policy of decen-
tralisation should be pursued in order to take
advantage of the fact that labour is more readily
available away from the metropolitan areas. In
Victoria this has been accomplished by the
acquisition of three existing factory buildings,
one at Bendigo where industrial V-belts are
now being produced, one at Baimsdale where
plant is being transferred to manufacture rubber
thread, and one at Frankston to which some
of our golf-ball production has been transferred.
In New South Wales this has been accom-
plished by transfer of portion of our shoe
production to St. Mary’s and by the erection
of new factory units on an extensive site at
Bankstown for the manufacture of Weather-
proofs, Geon plastics, some mechanical goods
and some footwear production. All these fac-
tories are modern, well equipped with amenities
and with plant laid out on efficient lines.
Your Directors confidently anticipate that this
policy of decentralisation will enable the Com-
pany to achieve a net gain in labour, to in-
crease total production, and to increase manu-
facturing facilities at Montague and Drummoyne
to further enhance our output of tyres and
heavy mechanical products, so urgently required.
STAFF TRAINING
The number of employees who have com-
pleted courses of training under the Dunlop
Training Scheme has steadily increased, and
18 per cent, of our employees have now benefited
by the facilities offered under this scheme.
The cadet system, introduced last year for the
first time, has been so successful that a number
of further cadetships has been awarded to selec-
ted young men with high scholastic qualifications
during the present year. - The scheme bears
promise of providing the company in the near
future with a first-class nucleus of trained,
well-educated, keen young men for supervisory
and staff appointments.
* SHAREHOLDERS’ BOOKLET
This year we have prepared a booklet of
a rather different character to those produced
in previous years. The booklet this year takes
the form of a brief descriptive account of the
policy and progress of the Company, of its
sales and manufacturing organisations and the
financial background. The whole booklet has
been written in a simple, easily understood
style, and will be of interest, not only to Share-
holders, but also to all the employees of the
Company, to whom it has been distributed this
year for the first time.
CONCLUSION
I am sure that Shareholders will agree that
the results that have been attained by the
Company in the financial year just completed'
constitute a remarkable achievement. Our busi-
ness has been carried on with enthusiasm,
efficiency, and unflagging effort on the part of
every member of the organisation. The con-
tinued loyalty and teamwork displayed by all
employees merits our most sincere appreciation,
and I feel confident that the Shareholders will
join with the Directors in paying just tribute
to all of our 4322 employees who have con-
tributed to the conclusion of a most successful
year in the face of many difficulties.
Ilie brief outline I have been able to give
you of the activities and achievements of the
past year will, I think, have convinced you
that your Company is a live and progressive
entity, and the indication I have been able to
give you of plans ahead which are being vigor-
ously pursued will, I am sure, confirm your
Directors’ confidence in the continued growth
of your Company and its ability to maintain its
position as the leader of the Rubber Industry
in Australia,

When Winter Comes.
One very simple fact is seen
as motivating the Soviet stalling
of the Western representatives in
the long-drawn-out and, as
expected, futile talks in Mos-
cow —every day of delay was a
day gained for the Kremlin,
since it brought winter that
much closer.
British and U.S. authorities
have stated that the Berlin “air-
lift” can be and will be main-
tained as long as Russia con-
ducts the blockade, but ob-
viously that is going to be much
more difficult in winter,
especially if they run into a par-
ticularly bad winter.
“Wall-street Journal’s” able
correspondent in Berlin, Joseph
E. Evans, expects that, using
winter as an ally, “the Russians
may very conceivably hope to
stage a demonstration of workers
from all sectors of Berlin, in
which the withdrawal of the
Western Powers would be de-
manded.” And, “Since the
stated policy of American Mili-
tary Government is to remain in
Berlin as long as the Berliners
wish it, that could put the West
in a very embarrassing position.”
However, on this particular
aspect of what winter may hold,
past Russian behavior may be
remembered to the. West’s ad-
vantage : “No matter what
miseries winter may bring, Ber-
liners still have vivid memories
of the days when the city was
under exclusive Russian rule,
and it is not likely that they will
voluntarily elect to have it
again.’,’
But that, in turn, will largely
depend on the West keeping up
the supplies of food and the
much bigger amount of coal
that will be needed in winter.
The reported Kremlin view is
that it has only to hang on and
winter will do its work for it.
And if winter is not doing its
work well enough, the Russians
are certain to lend it a hand by
obstructing the air-lift up to the
point—and even beyond it—of
bringing on a war.
Incidentally, the latest Mos-
cow talks coincided with the
ninth anniversary of the Stalin-
Hitler agreement which was the
real launching of the last war.
When that agreement was being
connived at, British and French
representatives were led on from
day to day in Moscow while
Stalin was making his war-deal
with Hitler’s envoys behind the
scenes.
Ready for War.
In a “Saturday Evening Post”
article Joseph and Stewart Alsop
have described the formation,
“at the highest policy level,” of
“a war plan—developed in the
hope that it will ensure peace.”
The big decision, the writers
declare, was taken at the White
House on Sunday, June 27,
when, “for the first time since
the dark year before Pearl Har-
bor, a major American policy
decision was reached with the
explicit understanding that it in-
volved the risk of war.”
The big decision turned on
the question of whether to re-
sist the Soviet pressure to drive
the Western Powers from Ber-
lin. On the two days, and
nights, preceding June 27 both
U.S. State and Defence Depart-
ments worked on the problem.
On the Sunday they had their
decision ready for the Presi-
dent’s approval, and Secretary
of Defence Forrestal and Under-
secretary of State Lovett went
to the White House. “In his
rather offhand way,” Mr, Tru-
man was about to approve the
plans as soon as they had been
formally presented, but Lovett
stopped him:
“By beginning the air-lift to
Berlin, Lovett pointed out, we
should set out on a course from
which there was no drawing
back. For we should thus
openly declare Our intention to
be firm and unyielding. If we
should thereafter timidly yield
— N. Y. "Herald Tribune.”
“HE LOVES ME, HE LOVES ME NOT. ..."
to the Soviets, the usual penal-
ties of appeasement would be
multiplied by ten, by the ex-
posure of our feebleness and
lack of resolution. No one
could guarantee that the Soviets
would relax their pressure; and
if we also were to be firm the
possibility of a clash was evi-
dent. Therefore, the President
ought to understand very clearly,
before making up his mind, that
this course of firmness involved
the risk of war.”
Even then Mr. Truman —who,
the writers say, “is bold on such
occasions” —did not hesitate “as
a more imaginative man might
have done.” He approved,
“agreeing that the risk was
preferable to any new appease-
ment.”
Thus began in earnest the
struggle for Berlin. And what-
ever the outcome there, Berlin,
in the writers’ view, is only a
beginning. Crises of the same
kind will recur, and each crisis
will present for whomever is
President of the U.S. the same
hard choice, “between the risk
of war and the penalties of ap-
peasement.”
If anything, the crises are
almost certain to be more and
more pressing, with “the masters
of the Kremlin growing yet
bolder and more demanding as
the gigantic work of Soviet mili-
tary preparation proceeds
apace.” And whoever the Presi-
dent may be, he will find on our
side “a shocking weakness,”
though the longer the delay the
less this may apply.
In the Berlin crisis, at the time
of the critical decision, the
French, the writers assert, “were
intensely reluctant to join the
common front. Even the British
gravely hesitated to be firm, and
this was for a very simple rea-
son. At present we [U.S.A.]
have neither the men, nor the
equipment, nor the bases, nor
the allies, nor even the plans
that we ought to have in order
to meet with confidence the
threats of a potential aggressor.”
Those requirements are in
process now of being secured.
On the question of bases, for in-
stance, there is the huge build-
up of U.S. air-power in Britain,
only some partial details of
which have come out. And the
writers make no bones about
what —in the war plan decided
on in the hope of its ensuring
peace—those bomber-fleets are
there for. They will drop atom
bombs on the vitals of Soviet
industry as fast and as plenti-
fully as they can get them
there.
What the writers set forth as
the U.S. line of action arising
•from that June decision is that
the policy will be continued no
matter who shortly becomes
President. They quote authori-
tative opinion as being that the'
Soviet General Staff underrates
this determination, “as Hitler
underrated the courage of the
British.” (As a matter of fact.
Hitler actually had the greatest
respect for, and considerable
fear of, the courage of the
British, as his own pre-war
words more than once made
clear.)
“In the event of war,” the
writers further report, “it is
thought that the Soviet military
experts expect America to sue
for peace when, and if, Europe
has been overrun.” That under-
rating of the weight of deter-
mination in American policy is
probably the greatest of all
dangers in the current and im-
pending crises. The counter-
balancing hope is that the men
of the Kremlin, “if they find
themselves confronted with a
free half of the world which is
economically healthy and full of
hope and, above all, too strong
to attack.., .will come to terms.
We shall then have at last that
true world settlement, that
genuine removal of the shadow
of fear fronv the nations for
which every sane human being,
whether Russian or American,
British or Yugoslav, constantly
longs. Then at last we can boast
that we have obtained peace in
our time, which is bought not
with feebleness and self-indulg-
ence and appeasement but with
self-denial and with courage.”
Meanwhile, the White House
decision of June 27 stands as
fixed policy, along with the
plans to implement it.
Bases in Britain.
Some 30,000 Yank airmen
were based at Burtonwood, in
Lancashire, during the war, and
that’s one of the spots where
the U.S. flyers are once more
settling in, just in case.
Burtonwood, N. Y, “Times”
has reported, is rapidly being
turned into “one of the greatest
air-maintenance depots in the
world.” The present “unprece-
dented setting-up in Britain of
a major American military in-
stallation in time of ‘peace,’ with
the wholehearted approval of
the British Government, is but
part and parcel of a major—
though unemphasised—shift of
United States air-power into
Western Europe during the past
six months.”
The same N. Y. paper reports
that three fully-equipped 829
bomb-groups, consisting of 90
long-range bombers, have
settled at four bases in eastern
England. The agreement be-
tween U.S. and Britain regard-
ing the bases “was made in
much the same spirit as lend-
lease or the destroyer-bases deal
during the war. Legalistic pre-
cedents were brushed aside in
the face of necessity.”
New World’s Shape.
International Labor Office
Director Sir Harold Butler, dis-
cussing in a “Foreign Affairs”
article the new shape of the
world now beginning to emerge,
regards this present year, 1948,
as probably “a crucial year in
human history.” He takes a
more optimistic view of Europe
than that now being presented
by various U.S. press correspon-
dents.
The world’s future shape, he
contends, will be altogether
different from anything that has
gone before. Factors in its
making include, in Europe, the
“huge Russian Power, already
master of all Eastern Europe,
ruthlessly stamping out its free
institutions, replacing them by
the police rule of Muscovite
tradition,” and, on the other
hand, a Western Europe
“drained of its economic life-
blood, much of it devastated, all
of it more or less mentally de-
ranged by the strain of the war
and the internal stresses of
enemy occupation.”
Since the war the destiny of
that smashed Europe has no
longer been in its own hands;
it has lain prostrate between
“the Russians and the Ameri-
cans, facing each other on the
Elbe and the Danube.”
Other factors in shaping the
world that is now emerging in-
clude the “two great movements
which have been gathering
momentum for two generations
—the expanding might of the
United States and the political
and social earthquake swallow-
ing up the old order in Asia.”
Even before the devastation of
the last war the growth of
American industry “had been
rapidly ousting Western Europe
from its position as the work-
shop and the banking centre of
the world.” Against that titanic
growth there was no hope for, a
Europe which “consisted of 20
or more small national units, all
working not with but against
each other, making no attempt
to pool their national resources
or to develop their agriculture,
their electric power or their
transport systems on rational
lines, surrounded like medieval
castles with moats and walls to
keep out each other’s trade.
“It has long been obvious that
a continent organised or, rather,
disorganised on these lines could
not hope to keep pace economi-
cally, scientifically or socially
with the 48 States of the Ameri-
can Union, working together,as
a single unit. It was also ob-
vious that the economic power
of the United States would
some day be translated into mili-
tary power, when the occasion
demanded. This was indeed the
lesson of the First World War,
but it was insufficiently under-
stood either by Europeans or
Americans. The former made no
move toward sinking their
ancient quarrels and uniting
their depleted forces in order to
recover their prosperity. The
latter withdrew into isolation,
unaware of or unwilling to face
the destiny which their national
achievement had thrust upon
them. The second war left no
further room for doubt. The
United States emerged from it
not merely as the world’s
greatest Power, but braced to
shoulder its responsibilities.”
In the light of the American
ascent, the decline of Europe
stood out in yet sharper relief.
The same effect followed from
the upheaval in Asia, where the
stresses of the second war
knocked away the last props of
the old order. “The pretensions
of Western civilisation to lead
mankind on an upward path
were patently contradicted by
the barbarity and ruthlessness
with which the Western nations
conducted their civil war, and
by the spectacle of death-camps
and torture chambers organised
by Europeans, which outdid the
worst traditions of Oriental in-
humanity. Within two years of
the war’s ending India, Pakistan,
Burma and Ceylon had attained
national status. Native republics
had been proclaimed in Java
and Indo-China. Not only Saudi
Arabia and Transjordan but
Syria and Lebanon had become
sovereign States. The European
domination of Asia was
finished.”
In the new world taking shape
out of all this confusion, the

DRY

BY APPOINTMENT TO HIS MAJESTY THE KING
writer sees as the most signifi-
cant change “tlje revival of
Western Europe’s will to live.
The mood of apathy and despair
seems to be yielding to new
hope and energy.” For that the
Marshall Plan must be regarded
as mainly responsible. “It was
not, however, the offer of
further American aid which re-
vived the drooping spirits of the
Europeans). What stirred them
to action was the notion that
by working together they could
use this American grant to lay
the foundation of a new Euro-
pean system. The concept of a
Europe united for the first time
in its history began to fire their
imaginations. In that direction
might lie not merely the road
back to prosperity but the road
toward the recovery of the
stability and self-respect which
Europe had forfeited by its two
fratricidal wars.”
Thus unexpectedly afforded
this new opportunity, Western
Europe is seen as making a good
beginning: “Already there is an
air of confidence, determination
and optimism in Britain, France,
Italy and the Scandinavian
countries which had previously
been woefully lacking.”
The writer pins his hopes for
peace to a Western Union in
Europe closely linked with the
British Commonwealth, the
United States and the Pan-
American Union. “Together
they constitute so formidable a
group that, as> long as they work
together, the danger of a major
war will be remote. If the dawn
of better times, which might be
heralded by a good harvest this
year, begins to cheer the
250,000,000 people of Western
Europe the menace of Commun-
ism will fade. If largely through
their own efforts they feel that
the hungry 40’s are being
banished and that the 50’s will
see them back on the road to
greater political, economic and
social security, they will feel no
urge to sell their freedom for a
mess of pottage.”
Such a revival of Western
Europe, in the writer’s) view,
would be of much more than
local importance. As its strength
dind well-being developed the
effect upon the eastern half of
the Continent would be pro-
found. Thus “We are now wit-
nessing a pregnant and poignant
drama. Can Western Europe
pull itself together this year and
next, for the issue may be settled
in as short a time as that? Can
it by its own united strength
stem the tide of Russian aggres-
sion now threatening Finland
and Scandinavia? Can it offer
to its peoples the first-fruits of
an economic revival based on
common use of its resources and
productive capacity? Can it ac-
quire the dynamism of a re-
newed and passionate faith in
the freedoms which have been
the lifeblood of its civilisation?
Will the United States help the
builders to lay these first stones
of the new Europe not only by
tiding them over the first few
difficult years but by making
common cause with them in de-
fending by all the means in its
power the ideals which have
made both Europe and
America?”
Given the right answers to
those questions a Western
world will have begun to take
shape, its centre of gravity no
longer in Europe, as hitherto,
but in the United States. “It
will no longer be divided by
barren hatreds, but will seek the
path to a better way of living
together. It will abjure war ex-
cept in defence of freedom itself.
That will be the beginning of
a real United Nations, no longer
crippled by a split personality
but held together by a common
faith.”
As to another question—Are
the rulers of the Soviet Union
ready to risk everything, includ-
ing war with the Western world,
in order to crush the rebirth of
the European spirit and to
achieve a world-wide Com-
munist empire? —we shall
shortly know the answer. “If it
is negative the first step will
have been taken toward an ac-
commodation between East and
West. History is what men
make it. We are now standing
at one of its great divides.”
Moscow’s Servants.
As seen by N. Y. “World-
Telegram’s” chief Washington
correspondent, Moscow’s closing
of its Consulates in America was
so much fuss and feathers signi-
fying nothing.
Reason: “Russia can still
command the services of 18
Consulates in the United
States,” — i.e., those of its satel-
lites and puppets: Czechoslo-

vakia, Poland and the rest. In
fact, if any Soviet agents abroad
“get in bad with the Govern-
ment to which they are
accredited” Moscow can switch
to one or another of her puppet
States’ representatives, who’ll do
what’s wanted as a matter of
course.
The “World-Telegram” corre-
spondent quotes Allied Intelli-
gence as stating there is in Mos-
cow a special office for just such
contingencies. “From there
secret lines of communications
extend around the world. There
is a branch agency in every Iron-
Curtain capital—in Warsaw,
Prague, Bucharest, Budapest,
Sofia and Tirana. From these
the feelers reach out into every
country where the satellites have
representatives—a “new world-
wide system,” perfected “because
Moscow wanted to be prepared
for possible diplomatic breaks.
“Russia could recall her entire
Embassy as well as her Consu-
lar officials from any country
overnight and still benefit by the
customary information and other
services.”
King Coal.
What coal means in Britain’s
recovery and what the miners
of it could contribute if they
wished, as stated by Parlia-
mentary secretary Alfred
Robens, of the British Ministry
of Fuel and Power, urging the
miners to “stop immediately all
practices that restrict output”:
“Absenteeism'this summer has
averaged about 10 per cent, for
all workers, and an improvement
of only 1 per cent, would give
an increased output of about
2m. tons a year. In the same
way an improvement of only .01
ton in the overall output a man-
shift would give a similar in-
crease.
“What these increases could
mean is shown by the fact that
100 tons of exported coal would
provide enough foreign exchange
to buy 12,300 gallons of petrol
or nearly 1,000,000 cigarettes
from America, or 30,0001 b. of
sugar from the West Indies,* or
15,0001 b. of beef from Aus-
tralia.”

“Considerable uneasiness and
uncertainty,” reports Runner,
i.e., “prevail in many quarters,”
thou B h . “ unlike a * ear ° r s °
ago, these views are not being
given wide public expression.”
Most observers, the writer
states, believe that business ac-
tivity “will hold up well through
the balance of this year.” He
quotes, however, the President’s
Council of Economic Advisers:
“It is typical for inflationary
and speculative booms to col-
lapse while business sentiment is
still confident.”
The writer declares that some
of the think-
ing about business” even expects
a change for the worse before
this year is out; and “No one is
saying anything definite for pub-
lication about 1949.”
U.S. Wool Research.
Reported by N. Y. “Journal
of Commerce,” iF. Eugene
Ackerman, addressing as director
the American Wool Council,
declared that success of research
now to be undertaken by the .
council and the International
Wool Secretariat would mean
that textures made of wool,
“from carpet-wools to the finest
super-wools of Australia,” would
be improved.
Markets for the increasing
world supplies of medium wools,
he added, will be widened by
making them available for tex-
tures which can now be obtained
only through the use of the con-
tinually diminishing supplies of
fine wools.
The research programme,
Ackerman declared, is critically
necessary at this time for the
continued welfare of the world
wool-growing and wool-textile
industries. Owing to decreased
production and increased world
demand, prices of combing
wools for worsteds have in-
creased an average of 150 per
cent, since September, 1946, and
more than half of this increase
has occurred since January, 1948.
The outlook for total world wool
production for 1949 indicates
that fine wool supplies will be
approximately 40 to 45 per cent,
less than in 1942, and about on
a level with 1948 production,
whereas American demand par-
ticularly, and world demand
generally, will continue at pre-
sent levels.
The United States," it was said,
will consume approximately 11
hundred million grease pounds
of wool in 1948, of which more
than 65 per cent, will be fine
wools, of grades 60s, or better.
This compares with an average
annual consumption of
600,000,0001 b. annually in pre-
war years, of which the U.S.
supplied more than 60 per cent.
Today the U.S. is dependent on
foreign sources for more than
75 per cent, of its peace-time re-
quirements.
Ackerman advocated that a
long-range supply programme
with important world wool-grow-
ing centres such as Australia,
South Africa and New Zealand,
and with the Argentine and Uru-
guay, should be worked out to
assure the U.S. of a continuing
adequate supply of wools. This
programme should include stock-
piling of required qualities to
meet emergencies and to guard
against undue price increases
under pressure of sudden mili-
tary needs, he said.
“If some such basic project
is not pursued for the benefit
of the entire industry,” Acker-
man concluded, “wool cannot
hope to hold its place as the
premier clothing fibre in
America. If the textures the
public wants cannot be found in
wool, the public will take those
textures in other fibres. This is
being evidenced today in the
tremendous advances made in
the promotion and sale of tropi-
cal suits made of rayon,”
Dragnet Digest.
Diplomatic Bad Language. —One of
N. Y. “Times’s” writers on world
affairs makes a point worth noting
for whenever the fulminations that
now pass current for diplomatic
language fill the air. Formerly all
diplomatic exchanges were couched in
terms of understatement, such as this
or that country “views with concern”
or “must decline to be responsible
for the consequences,” etc. Unless
that language was understood things
always appeared better than they were.
Now the currency is overstatement,
with the opposite effect of the old
style—that is, 'it makes the situation
always look worse than it really is.

Another Injustice. —As reported by
N. Y. “Sun,” Costello insists on
being designated Prime Minister of
Ireland, not Eire: “Don’t call it
Eire —a British invention.”

More Purges Pending. —ln case the
comrades here haven’t caught up with
it, their Cominform newspaper, pub-
lished in Bucharest, gives them these
directions: “The mass recruitment of
new members to the Marxist parties
has in certain cases obliterated the
demarcation line between the party
and the masses. These facts should
serve as a serious lesson to the party
organisations in all countries. Tireless
work must be carried on to purge
the party of alien elements who have
managed to creep in.”
* * * *
United Arabs. —Predictions that if
events in Palestine turned against the
Arabs the Arab League would fall
apart and Arab unity disintegrate are
being proved false, according to a
Cairo correspondent of N. Y. “Times.’'
Instead, “the Arab States may present
to the world a front perhaps even
more united than before.” The ex-
planation is that “danger is an im-
perative unifying force, and the Arab
Governments see in Israel a real
menace.”
* * * *
U.N.O.’s Misplaced Role. —U.S.
Secretary of State Marshall apologises
for U.N.O., cast for a role a bit be-
yond it: “It was supposed to main-
tain the peace; but it has really be-
come involved in all of its early days
in trying to make the peace, which is
an abnormal situation, but which it
has f.o face. It is very difficult to
take a meeting of 58 nations, speaking
every language, with all sorts of his-
tories, traditions, customs and misun-
derstandings of each other and come
to solid agreements. Yet that is the
hope for the peace of the world, and
we must do everything we can to sup-
port it now,”
* * * *
'Nationalised Czechs. —L o n d o n
“Times” Prague correspondent, in a
long article reporting the decline of
Czech industry under nationalisation
(output decreasing, absenteeism rising,
consumers with less and less to con-
sume), concludes: “Czechoslovakia
provides proof that the phenomenon
of too much money chasing too few
goods is not confined to capitalist
countries and that wholesale nationali-
sation so far as the workers are con-
cerned simply means the exchange of
one set of masters for another much
more powerful, against which the
strike weapon is of no avail.”

Guns and Butter. —In a “Foreign
Affairs” article, Bernard Brodie, Yale
Associate Professor of International
Relations, comments on the U.S. as
the only major Power in the world
that is relatively free from the neces-
sity of choosing between “guns or
butter,” for the simple reason that
its gross production is so great that
a formidable military organisation can
be built up from only a small part of
it. There is plenty of butter for all
in the remainder. “Of course,”
Brodie adds, “we [the U.S.] can
always insist upon ‘more butter’ to
the detriment of our national security,
and are clearly in danger of doing so
in so far as our national security is
bound up with aid to Europe. But
so far as our own armed forces are
concerned, we can have our guns
and eat our butter too.”

Antl-U.S. Chinese. —Pained com-
ment by a “Wall-street Journal”
writer: “The Chinese, who would
never have regained their main cities
and their national sovereignty without
a tremendous outpouring of American
blood and tteasure in the Pacific, give
visible signs of not liking us [Ameri-
cans] very much. Anti-American
demonstrations have become one of
the chief extra-curricular activities of
China’s restless students. They don’t
seem to think it is enough that we
rescued China from Japanese occupa-
tion and poured large sums of money
into that country since the end of the
war. ITiey want us to keep Japan in
such a state of industrial paralysis
that large American subsidies will be
necessary to ward off starvation in
that country. They take it unkindly
if we show signs of wearying and take
some feeble, timid, halfhearted steps
toward making Japan self-support-
ing.”

Our welfare as a nation is directly linked with the condition of
our farm lands. The conservation of soil and water in our
restricted agricultural areas is so urgent a necessity, so vital a
concern of every citizen, that it has become the dominant feature
of the Government’s rural policy. Erosion at a rate faster than
that which caused the U.S.A.’s notorious "dust-bowl” has so
impoverished some districts as to force the abandonment of
once richly producing properties.
Foremost in our Commonwealth plan for soil conservation and
reclamation is "Caterpillar” Diesel Tractors. For contour fur-
rowing, grading, irrigation schemes, pasture improvement,
water conservation and reclamation of heavily eroded areas,
whether in the hands of Government instrumentalities or the
progressive man on the land, the most efficient and economical
method is by "Caterpillar” Diesel Tractors and Equipment.

RETREAT—OR CHAOS.
The seriousness of the situation in Europe
needs no emphasis. All the signs of a
major crisis are to be seen. It was hoped
when the Western Powers took steps to
demonstrate their firmness in the matter of
Berlin that the U.S.S.R. would moderate
its actions and show some signs of
reconciliation. But, week-end develop-
ments notwithstanding, the Russians’ atti-
tude has become more impudent and
provocative and their actions more war-
like and stubborn.
It cannot be said, in the light of ex-
perience, that Soviet actions are due to
fear of aggression and that its isolation
has rendered it timorous in the presence
of the Western world. For its stands
in certain situations have been so incon-
sistent that they can be explained only
as the product of a calculated policy of
pretence.
In 1939, for instance, the Kremlin pro-
fessed to be in a state of alarm at
the threat of aggression from little Fin-
land, and it continued in that assumed
state until if claimed that its fears had
been realised and that the Finns had
actually attacked it. In 1940 it and all
its satellite Communist parties through-
out the world, which were then doing the
work of Hitler and behaving in such a way
that —in the words of Mr. Adolf Berle,
the United States Under-Secretary of State
—some Communist bodies “were not
sure whether their orders were coming
from Berlin or Moscow,” professed to be
in deadly fear of attack from the British:
the British who were clinging by the skin
of their teeth to North Africa.
At that time the Westralian branch of
the Australian Communist party was
caught redhanded circulating a pamphlet
from enemy Vienna, issued by the Comin-
tern, which declared;
Comrades: The Communist International
warns that war may spread rapidly to the
eastern Mediterranean, the Balkans and the
Pacific. The Comintern message says that
workers must demand the return of their
husbands, brothers and sons to Australia.
Australia is controlled by the lackeys of
the incompetent bloody rulers of Britain,
and Australians must be brought home.
Yet while, at that time when France
and the small countries of Western
Europe had just been overrun by the
hordes of Hitler, cheered on by Molotov
and Vyshinsky, the Russian leaders pro-
fessed to live in dread of attack from
those who were overrun or about to be
attacked, they, in the following April,
lightheartedly pooh-poohed the warning
of Sir Stafford Cripps that Germany
would attack Russia even when he named
the specific date—June 22 —on which the
actual invasion of Russian territory would
take place. They claimed to see in the
warning only another plot by those base
aggressors Britain and France to involve
two faithful friends in war.
Now Russia professes to be in deadly
fear of aggression again, and its profes-
sions are accompanied by the usual signs
and actions. Its radio blares daily abuse
of the “new Municheers who are trying to
turn U.N.O. into a pliant tool of the
American monopolists.” It is openly and
systematically, in its European as well* as
its American radio sessions, accusing the
Western Allies of seeking to “build up a
new Imperialist to attack Russia
and plunge the world once more in the
horrors of a bloody war.”
The appeal of the Western Powers to
the U.N. Security Council has little real
significance. The Council’s permanent
members —the U.S.A., U.K., U.S.S.R.,
France and China —are all immobilised by
being parties to the dispute as makers of
the Potsdam Agreement. Messrs. Bevin
and Marshall are super-optimists if they
believe that it is possible to get the unani-
mous affirmative vote of seven members
necessary to produce any result whatever
from a body which includes the Ukraine,
a part of Soviet Russia.
Syria has already more or less become
in default to every principle of U.N.O.
by engaging in war in Palestine. The
Ukraine’s M, Manuilsky has accused Mr.
Bevin of “rattling the atomic sword at
Russia.”
M. Spaak, the head of the Belgian
delegation to the Assembly, on the
very eve of the reference of the dis-
pute to the Council, delivered one of the
most terrible indictments of Russia which
has been heard:
Russia has no need to look for compli-
cated explanations of Western policies. It
is simple....it is fear of you, fear of
your Government.... Only one great Power
emerged from the war powerful from the
acquisition of new territories. That is
Russia. You have annexed the Baltic
countries, part of Poland, Finland, Be-
cause of your audacious policy you have
reached Warsaw, Prague, Budapest, Buchar-
®t, Berlin, which you are not ready to
leave The truth is that your foreign
policy is more ambitious and audacious
than that of any other nation There is
not a single country in the world, including
Africa and Asia, in which the Soviet Gov-
ernment’s representatives have missed an
opportunity to weaken that country morally,
politically and socially... .We feel that you
are on the very brink of the Rhine. ,
The last words are the most ominous ;
they embody the crucial truth of the situ-
ation. The propaganda from Moscow
in the last week shows that Berlin is
merely a stage. Control of Western Ger-
many, allegedly to prevent its inhabitants
being trained and turned against the
Soviet Union, is now Moscow’s immedi-
ate aim. And all the world believes that,
with United States Congress embarrassed
by the Presidential election and winter
about to hang its cloak in front of Eastern
Europe, this would be a favorable time
for Russia to force its ambitions.
Thus Britain has turned from its hard
task of rehabilitation to the reproduction
of defence armament, no doubt bitterly
regretting that its Socialist Government
has incautiously destroyed so much
machinery of protection in the last few
months. The Western Powers have ap-
pointed Field-Marshal Montgomery to
command a Western defence force at a
moment when the provocations of the
Russians in Berlin have become so in-
solent as to be almost intolerable; their
bullets falling in the American zone, t their
Yaks diving in clouds in the air-corridor
in defiance of all rules and safety regu-
lations.
If there is war there is only one nation
which conceivably wants it, only one
which will have provoked it —the one
whose subsidised terrorists are murder-
ing Australians in Malaya without pro-
test from the Australian Government,
the one whose treacherous emissaries
threaten to immobilise France, Italy and
Australia equally if hostilities break out.
It is a grim fact that only one thing
can prevent war —a complete change of
attitude by Russia both within and with-
out its own borders.
For so long as it persists in its present
attitude to Germany and to its neighbors,
for so long will Western Europe lie
under the shadow of the gravest peril.
And the Allies cannot give away an inch.
They know that, even if they agreed to
share control of Western Germany, Russia
would never, on her past form, make the
slightest attempt to keep the contract.
They know that once Russia secured
control of the Ruhr the whole of Western
Europe would be as good as absorbed
into the Russian system. For the Ruhr
is the key of the industrial life of the
west.
Civilisation, this time, is at stake.
Riding for a Fall.
Those people have been proved right
who refused to believe that the Federal
A.L.P. Conference could, in the matter
of the party’s Red Objective, cut off its
nose to save its face. Sponsors of a
motion from Queensland supposed it
could, but the conference and the party
are too far committed.
Not that there isn’t urgent need to
save face for next year’s general elections
—the triennial conference met to decide
ways and means of doping the electors
for that campaign. Besides, there was
good room for argument. The case for
retaining the Red Objective was;
The electors would not believe the change
of face anyway, highly suggestive as it must
be of the leopard swapping its spots, Haile
Selassie giving himself a coat of whitewash,
or Stalin substituting the “Cominform” for
the “Comintern.”
The pledge that every “Labor” candidate
has taken binds him to dutiful obedience of
the executive’s dictation and specifically to
go the whole hog in socialisation of in-
dustry, production, distribution and ex-
• change.
Mr; Chifley has already double-crossed
the electors by going to the last elections
on a policy of moderation and stand-pat,
and then, when he won it, turning on the
heat for the Socialist-Communist revolution,
■ regardless of whether he could get a popu-
lar mandate or not.
The case for watering it down was:
The revulsion of popular opinion against
the socialises, as was shown in the Com-
monwealth-wide resentment against the
Bank Grab Act —so marked that Mr.
Chifley quickly refused to go on with
socialisation of insurance enterprises and
has refused again to socialise the coal in-
dustry (but that doesn’t pay anyway).
“Labor’s” loss of general elections in
S.A., Westralia and Victoria.
The intervention of Roman Catholic or-
ganisations to call their considerable
“Labor” following to heel, banning the
Red Objective and the Socialists’ Com-
munist allies.
The split in the party over the executive’s
easy tolerance of the Communists, as
revealed by organisation of “A.L.P. indus-
trial groups” to fight the Reds, and at the
late Victorian and N.S.W. A.L.P, con-
ferences the threats to withhold unions’
political contributions,
But the party, it was decided, has been
wading across the stream to the revo-
lutionary shore for a long time, and,
though still uncertain of the footing
ahead, cannot now turn back and imperil
its cohesion and baggage,
Mr. Clarey, chairman of the committee
appointed at the last triennial conference
to revise the Federal platform and rules,
put this argument in more acceptable
language. He and his Victorian col-
leagues have no illusions, after their
crushing defeat at the Victorian elections,
about the socialisation issue as an elec-
tion-loser. But what he told the con-
ference last week was that “the socialisa-
tion objective had stood the test of time”
(it did, in cold-storage, but each time it
was brought out “Labor’s” chances col-
lapsed at once); that “since 1921 ‘Labor’
Governments had been elected for the
Commonwealth and every State” (not
one of them on the socialisation policy);
and further, he said—and this was the
gem of his remarks:
There is no need for public alarm. No
industry can be socialised or nationalised
without the people’s consent.
The public alarm is aroused all right,
and what aroused it was precisely Mr.
Chifley’s embarking on socialisation
without the people’s consent, and his
cynical indifference towards the need to
obtain that consent. It is good to know
that Mr. Clarey admits, for the executive,
both the public alarm and the cause of it.
Socialisation being thus nailed to
“Labor’s” masthead in order to make the
best of a bad job for the 1949 elections,
the history of the ramp that has raised
it and of the Communists’ part in it is
due for recapitulation. The impudent
Sharkey, the “mimicking Molotov” who
can do what he likes under the Chifley
“Government,” has made no bones about
the origin of the Red Objective. “The
growing influence of the Communist
party,” he has written in his history of
it, “brought about the adoption of the
socialisation objective by the A.L.P.” In
that decision (made at the A.L.P. Con-
ference of 1921) the Communists’ chief
allies were Messrs. Holloway, Don
Cameron and Drakeford (still Ministers),
Scullin (who tried in 1931 the Chifley trick
of 1947), Beasley and Makin (now escaped
to fat overseas posts), various State
“Labor” leaders whose Parliamentary
careers were in Opposition so long as the
electors remembered their part in the
business, and the Kilburns, Donald
Grants and Jock Gardens of the Trades
Halls.
They all knew exactly what they were
doing. They were avowedly out to over-
throw Parliament, the democratic system
of government and all private enterprise
in the national economy. “Socialism,”
declare the heads of the Communist
party in their plan of campaign, “is the
first phase of Communist society—as it
is when it has first emerged after pro-
longed birth-pangs.” Mr. Holloway, for
“Labor,” approved: “Socialisation of in-
dustry,” he chanted in 1921, “is the cul-
mination of the teachings of Marx.” He
still finds difficulty in discriminating be-
tween Communism and Christianity. The
1921 Trade-union Congress (which he
chaired) and the A.L.P. Conference of
the same year drew up the Moscow-
inspired socialisation objective, and laid
down the methods as:
The use of the electoral machinery to get
control of Parliament and then of the Par-
liamentary machinery to socialise industries.
During the necessary interregnum the sub-
stitution of government by regulation for
Parliamentary government.
The creation of a new form of Govern-
ment by a supreme economic council, on
the lines of the Moscow politburo, “elec-
ted” (following the Russian model of
elections, of course) by worker-groups in
the socialised industries.
That is the revolution on which the
latest conference has confirmed the
“Labor” course. The programme was
endorsed by the 1931 A.L.P. Conference,
which even tried to get a plan for “Social-
isation in Three Years” adopted, begin-
ning with abolishing the trading banks,
by which means (as Lenin laid down)
“all small industries can be tied hand and
foot.” The 1931 Conference declared that
“the necessity for a non-Parliamentary
form of government is inevitable.”
At that conference the difference be-
tween nationalisation and socialisation
was also explained to many bewildered
lieges. Nationalisation, the expropriation
of private enterprise, declared the official
report, is the first step; it substi-
tutes State capitalism for private capi-
talism. Socialisation expresses the trans-
fer thereafter to a Supreme Economic
Council elected by the workers (/.<?.,
party members) only, just as Parliament’s
political control is transferred to the same
dictator body.
There was no “Socialisation in Three
Years” because “Labor” could not win
elections. But the work of organising
the unions in industrial groups and the
suppression of the old craft unionism
went on, and the Communists built up
their control of the industrial machine.
Political “Labor” was too intent upon
getting a Parliamentary majority by hook
or by crook to oppose this change, even
if it wished ; and, anyway, it was in the
socialisation programme. Then came the
war, Mr. Curtin’s attaining office with
independents’ support in 1941, and Dr.
Evatt’s prompt removal of the Menzies
Government’s war-time ban on the Com-
munist party. The 1943 elections returned
Mr. Curtin with a “Labor” majority, and
the A.L.P. triennial conference of that
year, discreetly postponed till after the
elections, ordered “a nation-wide cam-
paign for socialisation” immediately.
Mr. Curtin was pledged not to intro-
duce socialisation during the war, but the
A.L.P. State conferences acknowledged
no inhibitions. In N.S.W. it went ahead
for a “Socialisation in Ten Years” plan,
sponsored by Mr. Chifley’s henchman,
Mr. Bill Taylor; and as soon as the war
was over (and Mr. Curtin dead) the 1945
“special” Federal conference declared for
implementing the socialisation programme
under the guidance of a National Plan-
ning Council, and drew up recommenda-
tions for the 1948 conference, the one
just concluded.
Parliament is to be abolished —the
Senate first, and the State Parliaments,
and then the last remains of the law-
making body which the people have
hitherto elected. The cry is, as Commerce
Minister Pollard said at Ballarat last
April—“On and on in the socialistic
manner.” Every activity is to be nation-
alised except military service in defence
of the nation, and that is to be left to
private enterprise—that, and, as Mr.
Chifley adds, ice-cream carts. As accom-
paniment the 40-hour week is to be re-
duced to 30 hours, with progressive in-
creases in wage-rates.
Under “Labor’s” plan this country
ought to be a soft thing for any army
of invading coolies in a generation’s time.
"Send Round the Hat."
“Old-timer”: From Nullagine to the
Condamine, from Darwin down to
Drouin, sending round the hat has ever
been the expression of Australian
sympathy and generosity in the troubles
of mates, neighbors and friends. I sup-
pose if I had all the money I’ve chucked
into hats to support new-born babies,
sick toilers, bereaved women, burnt-out
cockies, sacked shearers, disqualified
jockeys and stranded barmaids during a
wandering and misspent youth I could
buy a pub for myself. If I could add to
it the cash spent on raffle-tickets, benefit
dances, button-days, bob-in funds and
office whip-rounds in city jobs, and add
to that sundry private donations, great
and small, to close personal friends in
trouble of some soft or other I could buy
enough Government loan bonds to keep
me in beer for the rest of my life. That
can be said of pretty well every Aus-
tralian, whether he’s spent all his life in
one spot or roamed the continent for
most of it. In 30-odd years of inter-
mittent toil and roaming, during which a
multitude of hats have been thrust under
my nose. I’ve never met anybody who
resented chucking in his whack towards
whatever cause it was.
Somewhere back in his railway days
Mr. Chifley had to chuck in a bob or two.
It seems to have stuck in his gizzard ever
since. Now, as Prime Minister, he appears
bent on getting even for it, just as he
seems bent on getting even for having
gone on strike away back in 1917. He
told Parliament the other day that the
“Labor” party intended to go on taxing
everybody worth taxing so it could have
millions from which to give money to
those not worth taxing. “Most of us on
the Government side,” he moaned, “have
come from poorer families and seen wives
and children in desperate need.” Then
he told the House (manfully restraining
his tears, we may presume) of how he’d
seen collections taken up for those in
trouble. And “because this is deeply in
the hearts of all,” the Labor party set
out to “provide social security and im-
proved benefits.”
To which it may be answered that as
many not on the Government side came
from “poorer families,” but lifted them-
selves by hard work and thrift beyond the
needs of charity—Government or other-
wise. Now from their hard work and
their thrift Mr. Chifley proposes to help
a lot of people, many of whom never
thought of saving or of raising them-
selves and never will think of it while
they’re led to believe that the “Govern-
ment” will take the money from some-
body else and dole it out to them. What
becomes of his scheme when the saving
and thrifty wake up and refuse to save
'money for Mr. Chifley to give to some-
one else isn’t clear.
What is clear is that the man
is suffering from too many com-
plexes embedded in his soul in his work-
ing days. He’s like the station-hand who
won Tatt’s and refused ever afterwards
to eat mutton because he’d once been a
station-hand. What Australia ought to
do is send round the hat, take up a
collection and hand it over to Mr. Chifley,
and ask him if it will square him for the
hats he chucked into in the long ago.


PLAIN ENGLISH
The Liberals.
Liberal-party supporters and would-be
supporters and wavering folk searching
through the very skimpy press reports of
the Liberals’ Federal Council conference
in Adelaide may have been disappointed.
Except for Mr. Casey, who told his fol-
lowers that though they’d won three
State elections, several by-elections and
defeated the Socialists’ Prices Referendum
they couldn’t afford to “run away with
the idea that the next elections were in
the bag,” there seemed to be a tendency for
the proceedings to get tangled up in words.
On Communism, for instance, it was
decided
to deal with treasonable and subversive
activities and to consider what amendments,
if any, should be made to existing Common-
wealth legislation.
Also, that the Liberal party
regards it as a major task to establish
publicly that the Communist party is a
subversive organisation, and to advocate
that the powers of government be used to
expose the extent and subversive nature of
Communist activities, and the identity
of the people concerned in them.
Looked at only superficially, directness
and brevity might have been more in-
spiring. Also with the defence resolution;
“Complete and constant review of the re-
sources of this country and the means
by which these resources may be directed
to defence in the event of emergency.”
And on the housing question.
But Liberal-party supporters should re-
member that good government is often
unspectacular; administration, not talk,
is the thing. The Liberals intend to intro-
duce compulsory secret ballots in the
trade-unions, coal is to be rationalised
instead of nationalised, there is to be a
contributory health scheme, the coun-
try is to have its water resources investi-
gated and developed as a matter of
urgency, and the land industries are
to have “stabilisation schemes based on
guaranteed minimum prices permitting a
reasonable margin of profit.” Taxation-
relief is planned, the middle-income
groups receiving special attention.
The country is desperately anxious
to be given leadership and respon-
sible government, being alarmed by
the Bank Grab attempt, the calculated
obstruction of production, the wide-
spread industrial lawlessness, the leaping
costs of everything, the amount of money
the Chifley Government is raking in and
the way in which it is being spent.
“Labor’s” obvious determination to stick
to socialism, the rampant insolence of the
Communists and the state of affairs in
Europe and nearer home in Burma,
Malaya and the N.E.I. add to the national
concern.
Mr. Casey has offered the community
democratic leadership; and a return to
democracy, with an awareness of the un-
happy experience of a people under a
“Labor” Government that has a totali-
tarian administrative policy, must be the
first big step in our political and
economic rehabilitation. The pre-war
method of government that Australians
knew, brought up to date by the grafting
on to it of improvements in economic
methods and legislation aimed at deal-
ing with those trying to obstruct govern-
ment of the people by the people for the
people, should be the basis of future
Liberal government.
Mr. Casey said the Liberals intended
to lead the community, not drive them.
The party believed in personal endeavor,
independence, enterprise, work and thrift.
Mr. Casey is to be praisfed for not being
afraid to turn back to the trustworthy
governmental and social principles of the
past and the necessity for upholding the
rule of law. And, himself a sponsor of a
form of social insurance under the Lyons
Government more than a decade ago, he
is unlikely to ignore much that is sound in
the way of new developments in dealing
with social and economic problems—in-
centive payments, profit-sharing, employ-
ment-control, etc. Evolution —politically
and economically—is a better basis for
the advancement of the people than revo-
lution.
The Victorian Country party expects to
be able to co-operate with the Liberals
when the time comes for preselection of
candidates for the next Federal elections.
That is encouraging. Equally encourag-
ing would be a determination by all in-
dustrialists to have no truck with the
Canberra Socialists in political matters.
Some business and beer interests appear
to have their own reasons for “playing”
with “Labor,” and for failing to join in
the common front against socialism, in-
dustrial lawlessness and Communism.
That sort of “shrewdness” has no lasting
future to it.
- Production and Politics.
Chifley’s “calls for more production”
are becoming hackneyed and rather
pathetic. The public has heard its Prime
Minister warning political assemblies,
A.L.P. conferences, trade-union deputa-
tions and a coalminers’ meeting that the
country and the “workers” were in for
economic disaster, collapse of the living
standard, failure of “full employment,”
and (this from “Fixer” Ashley, speaking
at his side) even downfall of the “Labor”
Government unless the unions give more
production in return for the “improved
conditions” received at their Govern-
ment’s hands.
But the miners continue to refuse to
raise the “darg” above a daily output that
allows many of them to go home after
lunch, the wharfies steadily reduce the
sling-load per man in their working
gangs, the brickies still lay no more
bricks than the union officially approves,
and union executives generally, sitting
very pretty, maintain the attitude of
“What’s it worth?”—what further con-
cessions will Chifley offer in return for
“more production”?
The Federal A.L.P. Conference last
week heard Chifley’s latest “call for
greater output” with reported warm
applause. It then carried two pre-
fabricated resolutions —one reaffirming
what Chifley had said, and the other
urging, as prerequisite to the desired re-
sponse, certain “legislative and adminis-
trative protection for the workers.”
Among other things wanted, as the
A.C.T.U. had some weeks before in-
formed the Prime Minister, are repeal of
AUTOMATIC, BUT APPROPRIATE.
THE PRIME MINISTER : “We are no more than the man who works the lift or sweeps
the street. Without US the country could go on."
THE SOUND-EFFECTS : "Hear, hear!"
punitive provisions under the Crimes Act,
Transport Workers’ Act, and Defence
Projects Act (and State legislation of the
sort as well); also a guarantee from em-
ployers at the mooted joint conference
that they will abandon all efforts to obtain
revision of the 40-hour week.
Other union demands have been for
amendment of the Arbitration Act to in-
clude compulsory unionism and to oblige
Conciliation Commissioners to hear plaints
even if applicant unions defy them by
remaining on strike. The A.C.T.U. is
also seeking Federal Government “assist-
ance” of the Arbitration Court towards
approving an imminent application for a
265. increase in the weekly basic wage. On
assurance of such “co-operation” by Mr.
Chifley, greater production may be sym-
pathetically considered. But “the boys”
have got to be coaxed; this is their
“Golden Age,” isn’t it?
Meanwhile the Federal A.L.P. Con-
ference laid down the new objective of
progressive reductions in the working
week to 30 hours, which would cripple
production completely and bankrupt every
Government and other employer in the
land. Every man Jack in the “Labor”
movement, the Prime. Minister and all,
Will be pledged, as a condition of pre-
selection for Parliament, to strive for this
end. It makes Chifley’s broadcast a few
weeks ago from London —the one in
which he summoned every Australian to
hard work —look completely silly.
Rut it is there now on the “ ‘Labor’
fighting platform,” along with socialisa-
tion of everything except ice-cream carts,
and freedom of action for nobody but
the Commos. With this crazed pro-
gramme the Government aspires to
develop adequate production to maintain
our standard of living, plus surplus for an
“export drive” to earn more dollars in
order to furnish this country with the
essentials which it cannot itself‘produce,
and fulfilment of Chifley’s promise that
“we must go all-out to help Britain.”
To such a pass is Government policy
reduced when dictated by synthetic
emotionalism about “crucified workers”
in this normally pleasant land and per-
petual distress over their lot in having to
earn a living by “making the wheels go
round.” That means all of us, of course.
Mr. Chifley’s appeals for more produc-
tion are always—and fatally—discounted
by his readiness to condemn as exploita-
tion and profit-chasing the motive of any
employer who requires the same wheels
to do more than just tick over.
•
Dedman in a Trap.
The Opposition caught Defence Minis-
ter Dedman in a neat trap last week. All
denials from him and the Prime Minister
henceforth that secrets of the C.S.I.R. or
other Government departments are ade-
quately guarded from Communist spies
are not worth a hoot.
The charge has been that because of
the employment by the C.S.I.R, or else-
where in Government departments of
Communists or Communist-sympathisers
—and because certain research-workers
have declared that the work on the
harnessing of atomic power ought not to
be secret —the Commonwealth is refused
the privilege of information concerning
American experiments and progress in the
harnessing of atomic energy. Ministers
have constantly denied the truth of these
allegations or that there is, or can be,
any leakage from the C.S.I.R. or other
departments. The denials have never
convinced anybody, particularly as the
head of the C.5.1.R., knight David Rivett,
in comment on them expressed a prefer-
ence for severing his Council from all
work on atomic weapons or allied mili-
tary secrets.
On the estimates late last week Mr.
Harrison initiated a debate on this ques-
tion, and drew Mr. Dedman into a snare.
Dedman denied as &lse Harrison’s re-
iteration of reports of American reluct-
ance to pass on high defence informa-
tion because of danger of leakage to
Russia through Australian Communists,
and he referred to the Opposition’s “wild
charges” about Australian security
matters. In short, his Government ser-
vices could not leak.
' Then up got Artie Fadden and read
from “confidential documents” an alleged
report by Dedman at a C.S.I.R. executive
meeting in July last of how Chifley, on
his visit to London, expressed concern to
British Ministers about these American
doubts as to the C.S.I.R. and his readi-
ness to take steps to remove them. Fad-
den also quoted from his sheaf of papers
Dedman’s own alleged remarks on the
question to the executive committee. Mr.
Chifley’s attempt to attribute the reports
as being disclosures from a British
Cabinet meeting are—rather obviously—
away from the point.
As prima facie evidence that the
C.S.I.R. can and does leak Fadden’s ex-
posure was certainly a facer. Dedman
appeared to recognise the information,
and Chifley, in a bluster, said it was
“disgraceful.” So it is: but it is also
highly salutary as showing that if an
Opposition party-leader can tap a leak,
the Communists’ ability, with their con-
tacts, to do so can hardly be denied any
longer.
A Matter of Privilege.
Whether it came from the promenade-
deck or was confided in a moment of
exasperation to a sympathetic stewardess
will probably never be known, but it
seems that a fair bit of heartburning was
endured by the Australian refugees from
politics. Federal and State, who tripped
down the Orion’s gangplank in England
the other day. It all had to do with
privilege and rank, notwithstanding -that
the crowd included mainly politicians and
their wives who are disciples, if not bene-
ficiaries, of the great “Labor” cause,
which aims, among other things, at a
classless society.
There were three Premiers aboard the
ship—the Queensland one went by air
and the Tasmanian one sent a proxy—
and a galaxy of Federal heads led by Mr.
Speaker Rosevear. It appears that Mr.
McGirr, having discovered that anybody
bearing diplomatic passports could evade
all currency. Customs and immigration
barriers in England and other parts, and
that sundry Federal members and their
wives were thus endowed by Canberra,
put the acid on Mr. Chifley, and was told
that Premiers didn’t rate that kind of
passport. Once aboard the lugger the
curious Mr, McGirr apparently learned
that his fellow-Premiers were, like him-
self, limited to ordinary passports, though
the Belgian, French and Dutch Govern-
ments had endorsed them with diplo-
matic privileges.
It then came up one of the forrard
ventilators (or maybe the third mate told
the carpenter, or was it the bo’sun’s
mate?) —anyway, somebody whispered
that Mr. Mulcahy, M.H.R., that eminent
elocutionist of the home front who put
Mr. Blain, M.H.R., ex-p.-0,-w. and
Digger of two wars, in his place, was also
armed with dip, passports, the plural
appertaining to Mrs. Mulcahy. Neither
Mr. nor Mrs. Mulcahy was attached to
the delegation in any “official capacity.”
Asked about all this gossip, Canberra
cautiously admitted that “it was possible
that all the Federal Parliamentarians” in
the party had “diplomatic endorsements.”
Still, once the travellers escaped from the
close contact of shipboard life and got
themselves scattered among the uncom-
prehending Europeans, where an Aus-
tralian politician of any rank is mighty
small potatoes indeed, it is likely that the
wounded feelings experienced that salve
which comes to the traveller in due time.
A "Voluntary" Levy.
Compulsory levies for political purposes
are not permitted in Australia, but the
Communist - dominated Ironworkers’
Association has devised a plan for a poli-
tical levy that is about as voluntary as the
unanimous vote cast for the Stalin ticket
in a Soviet election.
Each member of the union has
been sent a card on which he
is required to fill in personal details, in-
cluding his private address, place of em-
ployment and, if under 21, the date of
his birth. The card is called a nomina-
tion form, and the member is given the
option of nominating the Australian
Labor party (Official) or the Australian
Communist party to receive political levies
paid by him. He does this by crossing
out on the card the name of the party he
doesn’t wish to support. An accompany-
ing letter, undated but received by some
members late in September, states;
The payment of the levy will commence
on October 1, 1948. A member may, if he
wishes, be exempted from payment of the
levy; but to do so he must 'complete and
sign a “Contract Out” form, which must be
delivered to the branch office on or before
September 30, 1948. Any member who
does not do this is liable to pay the levy
for a full year before being able to con-
tract out. These forms are .available on
application.
Thus to avoid paying the “voluntary”
levy a member must call at the branch
office to collect a “contract-out” form,
complete and sign it and deliver it to the
office. In a union noted for its objection
to the secret-ballot and for the mass-
meeting technique of “stick up your hand,
mug: you’re in this,” it would bqginterest-
ing to know how many brave souls
breasted the office counter and asked for
“contract-out” forms.
Last week Mr. Lang asked the Prime
Minister a few questions about the card
and was told that inquiries would be
made. Apart from the ethics of the
matter a point that should interest the
P.M. as leader of the Australian Labor
party (Official) is the final sentence of the
circular:
Should both the parties be crossed out
by the member, then his levy shall be
allocated to the political fund for disburse-
ment on general political campaigns such
as bank-nationalisation, referendums and
other campaigns adopted generally by the
Labor movement.
As the Ironworkers’ Association is con-
trolled by Communists the obvious effect
of this is that the member who crosses
out both parties is placing the disposal
of his levy in the hands of the Comrades.
And since one stroke of a pen is much the
same as another no matter who makes it,
the bloke who crosses out Australian
Communist party is probably doing the
same.

POLITICAL POINTS
Comments by U.S. delegate Warren
Austin to Vyshinsky’s latest proposals on
atomic-energy control epitomise world
reaction to any seemingly altruistic sug-
gestions from Moscow. His first remark
was “They seem to be ready for agree-
ment” ; his considered verdict, “This is
just another Oriental manoeuvre of the
kind we have come to know.” In deal-
ing with countries, as with individuals,
present promises can only be judged in
relation to past performances. Time and
again kind words from Soviet diplomats
have raised high hopes, only to bring
bitter disappointment to those who placed
reliance on them. Molotov, Vyshinsky
and Co. regard diplomacy as a game of
chess played under Kremlin rules which
permit them to restore lost pieces to the
board whenever a checkmate is threat-
ened.
In the face of anguished protests from
Senator Cameron “Labor” has approved
the principle of sending a volunteer Army
overseas if the necessity should arise. But
where are the volunteers to come from?
It is “Labor” dogma, enunciated by
Calwell and supported by others, that the
men who joined the A.LF. in 1939 were
“economic conscripts”—unemployed who
signed up in order to get a square meal.
In these days of “full employment” there
will be no economic conscripts and con-
sequently no volunteers. Or are Calwell
and Co. admitting that their foul slander
on loyal Australians was only a foul
slander after all?
Chifley, defending his Government’s
social-service schemes, said in effect that
his policy had been to take from the rich
to give to the poor. “Labor made no
apology for having redistributed the
national wealth and income.” Why
should it apologise? After all, Robin
Hood used to boast of the very same
thing, and even Chifley’s most obvious
predecessor, Ned Kelly, made similar
claims and saw no shame in it.
When the High Court’s decision on
the Bank Bill was announced. External
Territories Minister Ward made a char-
acteristic remark about racehorses and
form. One thing about Ward, his form
is always predictable, especially when it
comes to speechmaking. Press him in
the right spot and out comes the same
old speech. He turned it on during the
Budget debate. All the old points were
there —the Brisbane Line, the “neglect” of
the country’s defence by the Menzies and
Fadden Governments, the planters who
ran out of New Guinea and Malaya when
the Japs came, the Depression, the in-
iquity of the Bankers and Capitalists, the
“saving” of Australia by the “Labor” Gov-
ernment and, of course, the blessings
“Labor” has showered upon the people.
Only addition was a series of quotations
apparently intended to prove that every-
one outside the Ward circle is a Fascist,
including J. T. Lang, who was Eddie’s
avowed leader until, with Beasley and
Lazzarini, the idol of East Sydney was
given Cabinet rank.
What the Pollard Wheat-“stabilisation”
scheme, upon which growers in N.S.W.,
S.A. and W.A. are voting—Victorian
growers voted for it the other week —
amounts to is that a fund created from a
tax on wheat is to be used at some future
date should the export price fall below
a guaranteed minimum price—now 6s. 3d.
a bushel, but which is to fluctuate
according to some cost-of-production
table—-to keep up a “stabilised” price.
This is not unlike the original purpose of
the petrol tax, which was to provide a
fund for the building and maintenance
of the aation’s roads. That fund should
now amount to around £165 million, but
Chifley has been using most of it “to
meet Commonwealth expenditure.”
Wheatgrowers who trust such a Govern-
ment with a wheat tax likely to grow into
millions -are very trusting indeed.
Mr. Cahill’s compulsory voting for
municipal elections hasn’t had much of a
.trial yet, but if the current campaign to
elect a council for his love-child, Greater
Wollongong, is a fair sample of how*he
A.L.P. intends to use the measure the
nasty smells' in municipal affairs won’t all
come from council incinerators and
rubbish tips. A leaflet distributed in the
Wollongong district and endorsed
“authorised by R. F. Connor, A.L.P.
Campaign Director,” stresses the fact that
voting is compulsory “just as in Parlia-
mentary elections,” lists “Labor’s” 15
candidates and says: “To avoid an In-
formal Ballot Paper, you MUST vote
for Labor’s Group of 15.” Sharp prac-
tice is putting it mildly.
Lift-drivers and street-cleaners pricked
up their ears for a moment on reading
the Prime Minister’s remark that their
work was of more importance than that
of himself and other Federal leaders. But
it was only for a moment; on Friday
they found their pay envelopes were no
heavier than usual and they had no reason
to think that those of the politicians
were any lighter. And of a rough census
among 14 lift-drivers and six street-
cleaners in a city block not one could be
found who believed the rumor that
Chifley was about to resign and seek re-
employment as an enginedriver so that he
could once again be one of “the people
who really make the wheels go round.”
Chifley’s remarks about the relative
importance of Parliamentarians and lift-
drivers must have been uttered either in
a spirit of humility or of hypocrisy. If
the former, how does he justify his party’s
sponsoring a huge increase in Parlia-
mentary salaries and allowances and its
introduction of members’ pensions to be
subsidised by taxpayers? And why a
bigger Parliament if its main effect is to
foist upon the country a few dozen more
“supernumeraries”? No, it couldn’t have
been humility.
In Victoria the Country party has ex-
pressed its willingness to come to an
agreement with the Liberals both in the
selection of candidates and the planning
of tactics for next year’s Federal election.
It has appointed a committee to confer
with the Libs. This will be bad news for
“Labor,” but worse still would be an
announcement that the two parties had
agreed not to cut each other’s throats in
N.S.W. country electorates.
The Bathurst “Advocate,” in Chifley’s
home town, says the Federal elections,
due next year, will be postponed, probably
to 1950. Hughes, as Prime Minister dur-
ing World War I, wanted to postpone the
general elections of 1917. He proposed
to do so by resolution of both Houses,
requesting the Imperial Parliament to
legislate for extension of the life
of the existing Federal Parliament. By no
other means —this not beipg sought as a
permanent alteration—could the Federal
Constitution’s provision which limits the
life of Parliament to three years be over-
come. The present Parliament is due to
expire in November, 1949. Hughes’s
war-time move failed because he had not
a majority in the Senate. Chifley’s motive
today is what —to get over the difficulty
produced by the complicated (and The
Bulletin has held illegal) arrangement
for election of some Senators for the en-
larged Parliament?
Dedman had hardly stopped talking
about “Labor’s” plans to develop the
neglected North when a Queensland com-
plaint about not getting a fair share of
German and Jap reparations machinery
arrived. Dedman said nothing could be
done, as Sydney and Melbourne were “the
main terminal ports” and the bulk of
the machinery had to be landed there.
“We didn’t make the map,” he grunted.
To which N.Q. “Register” replied that
it was about time Deddy and Co. set
about unmaking it in the way all their
decentralisation talk had implied. The
paper made acid comments on the system
of landing overseas goods for Queensland
at Melbourne and Sydney and reshipping
or railing them to their destination. But
by then Dedman was planning a new
sling-shot or something for Chambers’s
Army and wasn’t listening.
Victorian Acting-Premier McDonald
has told the National Fitness Council to
stop paying public money to the Eureka
Youth League, which he dubbed “a
kindergarten of Communism.” N.F.C.
organiser. Dr. Scholes, doubted if the
N.F.C. “had power to stop the subsidy”
to E.Y.L., and was quickly told that
if he had any doubts the Vic. Govern-
ment would “resolve them” for him.
A month ago, after the A.L.P. had
called upon Ward, M.H.R., and others,
to resign from the Australian-Russian
Society, that Communist-loving organisa-
tion “relieved” them of their membership
“out of respect and gratitude.” One
good turn deserves another; last week
in Canberra Eddie was on his feet putting
in a good word for Russia and making
the confident assertion that Communists
were not a menace to Australia.
W. M. Hughes’s 84th birthday brought
from E. J. Ward the comment “Eighty-
four years of iniquity.” Surely an over-
statement? After all, Billy was a Labor
man until he was 52.
Among the slogans carried in the
Sydney “Labor Day*’ procession on
Monday was one demanding the banning
of the B.M.A. Every sick unionist must
henceforth stay sick rather than call in
a doctor.
A fireman on a Sydney train was hit in
the face by a flower-vase as his engine
went through a cutting. Is it possible that
some maniac has been overcome by the
thought that every man on a railway
engine is a potential “Labor” Prime
Minister?
Despite a recommendation from the
last triennial A.L.P. conference in 1945
that the “Labor” party should, prepare
a treatise on socialisation “in order to
make it popular throughout the Com-
monwealth,” the 1948 conference, just
terminated, heard a report from the ex-
ecutive that “it would be impracticable”
to do so. With elections only a year
away, for “impracticable” read “unwise.”
The Miller case jn Melbourne ended in
victory for the Old Digger unionist who
fought the Communist-run' 8.W.1.U.
from go to whoa when it fined him and
banned jobs on which he worked because
he displayed some curiosity about a
union balance-sheet. Miller got a ton
of support when the union was de-
registered ; a mass meeting told the union
bosses to leave Miller alone, obey the
Arbitration Court and seek re-registration
at once. As Chandler, State secretary
of the 8.W.1.U., put it:
The committee decided to lift the fine
because it was being used by employers and
Mr. Miller in an attempt to divide the
union and make the way easier for the im-
position of lower wages and conditions on
members. The possibility of the black ban
on the Department of Works and Housing
job being used by the Arbitration Court
to prevent re-registration of the union also
caused the committee to resolve that, while
condemning Mr. Miller and calling upon
members to oppose his anti-union activities,
the fine be lifted and the ban withdrawn.
Put briefly, they can’t take it.
Out of the lOd.-a-gallon petrol tax
the Federal Government got slightly over
£l6 million for the year ended June 30.
Only about a third of it went to the States
for road work, originally the reason for
the imposition of the tax; consolidated
revenue got the rest. In the Prime
Minister’s own words, petrol tax is a
“Customs imposition necessary to help
meet Commonwealth expenditure,” which
makes it just about the most barefaced
example of sectional taxation ever
thought of by a rapacious Government.
The job of getting rid of the wheat
stored in N.S.W. country silos seems to
have everybody beaten. At the week-
end no fewer than 16 wheat ships were
waiting in Sydney Harbor, the McGirr
railways being incapable of delivering
more than 27,000 tons a week. Nearly
20 million bushels of bagged wheat seems
destined for destruction by vermin, rot
and neglect. The real culprit is Can-
berra, which openly tolerated the coal
hold-ups this year.
Sydney’s tramless Sundays are in part
a legacy of the 40-hour week. Suburban-
ites kept at home on Sundays through
lack of transport are being told through
Communist-sponsored leaflets placed m
their letter-boxes how the problem can
be solved. The solution is a simple one
—increased pay for trammies and a 35-
hour week. It might make sense to a
Marxist, but to the average householder
it brings up a picture of tramless Satur-
days, too.
Who said the Russkis weren’t co-opera-
tive? Why, they’ve just sent London
Zoo a collection of animals from the
Moscow Zoo, including a bearded
vulture! Moscow’s celebrated walrus-
moustached vulture, however, is being
reserved exclusively for home exhibition.
Western Union moved a step closer to
reality last week with the establishment
of a permanent military committee with
Montgomery as supreme commander,
and the discussion of plans for joint
action in the event of aggression. The
presence of American and Canadian ob-
servers at the discussions is important;
to be effective, any plan must ultimately
be underwritten by the two neighbors
from across the Atlantic.
Nothing definite can be expected from
Washington until after next month's
Presidential election, but Canada has al-
ready expressed its views through Mr. St.
Laurent, Prime Minister-elect. Last June
he told the Canadian Commons:
We feel sure that should war break out
that affected the United Kingdom and the
United States, we would inevitably be in-
volved and that there might be great value
in having consummated a regional pact
whereby these Western European countries,
the United Kingdom, the U.S.A. and our-
selves would guarantee each other’s
security We think this Western Union
is a good thing, but our adhesion to it with-
out the United States would add very little
to it. We are hopeful that it will develop
into something which will comprise the
United States along with those who are al-
ready members.... Our relations with
members of the British Commonwealth re-
volve around the United Kingdom as the
pivot of the Commonwealth. We do not
think anything that the United Kingdom
and the United States wpuld be in is some-
thing that we could avoid being in.
Canada’s leaders keep their feet on the
ground, and, with U.N.O. crumbling, they
see in some kind of Atlantic Union the
only hope for a harassed world.
Count Bernadette’s lieutenant and suc-
cessor in the thankless role of mediator
in Palestine, Dr. Bunche, has been out-
spoken in his report on the murder of his
chief. He finds it
inescapable that there was negligence on the
part of the authorities of the Jewish-
occupied area of Jerusalem in respect of
security precautions affecting the safety of
the mediator,
and he speaks of
an atmosphere of suspicion to the media-
tor’s efforts in Palestine, created by the
Jewish press and the pronouncements of
Jewish officials.
The rebuke is merited, and Bernadotte is
not the only victim for whose murder the
Israeli “Government” must share the re-
sponsibility with the terrorists they
tolerated.
Calwell will havd a few points to ex-
plain about his double-nationality bill —
it should be the Prime Minister’s pigeon
really, but for some reason Misinforma-
tion Arthur is carrying the baby. One
question is: Who asked for it, anyway?
Another, can he instance any case where
an Australian, either here or abroad, has
suffered any disability through the present
system?
At first glance the Soviet reduction of
the sentences of the Berlin anti-Commu-
nist demonstrators from 25 years’ to
eight years’ hard labor may seem merci-
ful, relatively at any rate. But the period
of the sentence means nothing ; men who
go to a Russian forced-labor camp don’t
come back.

“Mac Hoots”: It is possible that his
Majesty, when he visits Australia, will
enter the drive from Sydney Botanical
Gardens to Government House without
noticing the gateposts —he will, after all,
have a whole continent to inspect. On
the other hand, he may well be a con-
noisseur of gateposts: there is a lot of
lovely old stone in London. Till recently
there were four fine old posts at the
Gardens gate, but for three weeks three
men have been at work on them, scrub-
bing and chipping until the Sydney sand-
stone has altogether lost the golden-brown
patina of time and looks as raw and
startling as a tombstone. Apparently
during the chipping process a lump was
knocked off the top of one post,
so all four have now been neatly trimmed
and angled, as if with a plane. The gate-
keeper’s lodge, adjoining, has not yet
been mangled, so that the difference be-
tween mellow and raw stone is strikingly,
indeed glaringly, apparent. The stone-
masons might have spent a more profit-
able three weeks, and the Stone won’t be
fit to look at for another 100 years; but
if we are determined to make the King—
presuming he is fond of gateposts —
shudder, we have done well: the posts
will not go unnoticed.

“The Verger”: From time to time a
hopeful young artist is advised by The
Bulletin’s Religious Editor in the
“Answers to Artistic (and Inartistic)
Correspondents” to send his black-and-
white masterpiece to a parish magazine.
(An avid reader and collector of Anglican
church monthlies since the day I first
donned a surplice and cassock and made
my debut as a boy soprano, I have for
many years advocated the introduction
of humor into the pages of all parish
magazines. It therefore afforded me
exceeding joy to observe that the parish
magazine of the Church of the Venerable
Bede, Semaphore (S.A.), has reprinted in
its October, 1948, issue, a Morrissey
Bulletin joke-block depicting a trio of
“Oh, boy—the promised land!"
cannibals attired in portions of the gar-
ments of a deceased missionary and in-
forming a searcher for the departed
reverent gent, that “Well, he was here
about a- week ago.” If the idea spreads
I can see the next edition of the Aus-
tralian Authors and Artists’ Handbook
listing the parish magazine of St. Asaph’s,
Muggamulla, as being anxious to buy
joke-blocks with an eccelesiastical brand
of humor, payment to be made in illumi-
nated scripture texts.

“Becks”: These Fire-Prevention Weeks
are a great idea; they teach people to
be careful. For instance, a young girl
who was walking up Martin-place at
lunch-time last Thursday when the
Sydney Fire Brigade was giving a demon-
stration of firefighting has learnt her
lesson ; she’ll never go near such a display
again. In the centre of the roadway a
glorious blaze of burning oil and other
combustible material was sending a pillar
of black smoke up to the sky. The fire-
men were there in full force playing their
hoses upon the fire, and there was no
doubt that final victory would be theirs.
In the meantime, however, small patches
of flame were floating in the smoke as
burning matter was sucked up by hot
currents of air. One moment the young
lady was walking innocently along the
footpath; the next a passer-by was un-
ceremoniously ruffling her hair in an
attempt to extinguish the mild bushfire
that had broken out there. She escaped
with a singed topknot. During the com-
motion a lorry drove past and disappeared
around the corner. The driver had seen
the episode and was grinning. What he
couldn’t see was that other tongues of
floating fire were settling in the back of
his lorry, which was loaded with crated
straw. Whether he found out later this
writer cannot say, but from the fact that
the din of a fire-engine was heard a couple
of blocks away not long afterwards, he
has his suspicions.

“Craiser”: As usual, protests have been
made in Melbourne over the practice of
grand-opera singers singing an aria, then
rushing off to throw themselves into a
lake or something, and changing their
intention when they hear the thunders of
applause elicited by their efforts, and re-
turning to take a few bows while the
heroine changes her expression from one
of implacable hate to simpering acquies-
cence as she waits to get on with the fatal
business. It is only the new patrons of
grand opera who object to the custom;
old hands simply don’t bother. Gigli on
one occasion had sung only one line of
an aria when the New York Metropolitan
audience burst into loud applause. The
tenor was charmed beyond expression,
bowed himself double for about five
minutes, and then started all over again.
The members of the company at present
at His Majesty’s are of the one opinion—
the more applause they get the better
they like it. It inspires them to greater
effort, and if they were greeted with
melancholy silence they would be com-
pletely devastated.

“Dee”: The next great advance in
medical science will come when doctors
devise a way of turning the “tablespoon-
ful three times a day after meals” into
something which works with thera-
peutic value morning and evening only.
It’s the dose after lunch that causes all
the bother. I suppose not one man in
20 ever takes his physic to his work with
him, and the one whose wife puts it in
his pocket will probably forget to take
it, anyway. * I’ve tried ordering two
bottles, taking one to work. Invariably
that one is still nearly
full when the tide is
right out in the home
one.

“Woorndoo”; Years ago
I met Henry Lawson when
he was teaching at a Maori
village near Kaikoura —if
you could call it teaching.
Henry knew not a word of
Maori, and very little
about teaching. He would
write a sum on the black-
board and as often as not
add it up incorrectly. A
smart little Maori girl, a
cheeky little imp with a
dash of white blood in her
—a legacy from a Welsh
forebear who whaled in
those parts before civili-
sation hit the place—used
to hop out of her desk,
rub out the wrong answer
with the duster and put the
right figures in, saying
‘•That was not right, Mr.
Lawson ; it is right now.”
I used to call there with bread
a couple of times a week, and Mrs,
Lawson always gave me a cup of tea.
Henry seemed to make his own rules.
If school was in when I called he would
dismiss it and join us. I’ve had
beers with Henry, too, but I never
enjoyed them. I’m only a shandy drinker
myself, but it used to irritate me to see
the ■ way he would dwell on a drink.

“Salt Junk Joe”: If The Bulletin
Showman wants to write up a Flower
Festival let him go ahead by all means.
Pretty things, flowers, and all right in
their proper place—gardens, ladies’ bed-
rooms and, in the case of wildflowers,
down around Busselton for the big brown
’roos in their new coats to nibble. But
let the Showman stick to his geraniums
and daisies and leave things nautical to
those who have the tang of saltwater in
their nostrils. When he talks of the Roar-
ing Forties subsiding or moving south
from Busselton he is a long way off the
track, and on behalf of every old salt who

ever ran his easting down I must protest
most emphatically. The term Roaring
Forties does not refer to a wind but to
a geographical zone where the westerlies
blow all the year round. It is the belt
between 40 and 50 degrees south latitude;
Tasmania and the South Island of New
Zealand lie within it, but Busselton —no!
But perhaps I am doing the Showman
an injustice. Possibly the Roaring
Forties he has in mind are a team of
timber-cutters who, under the influence
of the Westralian wildflower season, bust
up their cheques and move south in
search of fresh stands of timber to fell.

“Glenunga”: It was in an A.L.P. con-
tribution to Adelaide “ Tiser”:
Here is another case —the married man
with two children who has had a constant
£4OO a year for the last four income years.
In 1944-45 he paid £46 taxes; the next
year (1945-46), £43; in 1946-47, £33; in
1947-48, £l2; and for 1948-49 it is proposed
that he pay £9. Look at the difference:
in 1944-45 he had £354 after paying his
tax; in 1948-49 he will have £391. His
direct taxation fell £37 a year, equal to
80 per cent., and the taxpayer now has
14s. a week more in his pay envelope.
“Here,” I howled to the missus, “what's
become of this extra fourteen bob?”
“Well,” she replied, “what hasn’t gone in
higher prices for fares, meat, vegetables,
clothing, smokes, milk, etc., you spend
on beer.” “But I don’t drink beer,” I
protested. “Exactly,” she said, “and soon
I’ll have the same answer when you

* “Minto”: Before Slyck handed over
his sales-run he gave me details of each
client. “For'years I’ve been trying to sell
old Jones, but he won’t budge from the
opposition line. He’s an obstinate old
beggar,” he said. Then his face
brightened. “But old Smith is different.
I sold him an order 20 years ago, and
he’s stuck to our brand ever since. Yes,
he’s a wonderfully loyal type of fellow.”
* * * *
“Cate”: Two businessmen of Port
Pirie (S.A.) have given a modern in-
terpretation of the old song “We Won’t
Be Home Till Morning.” M.V. Moonta on
the Spencer Gulf run made her weekly
call at Pirie on Monday evening and the
two went down to greet an old friend from
Adelaide who was on board. Their story
is that after a very pleasant chat they
made their way on deck to go ashore, but
found the ship well out in the gulf—next
stop Port Augusta. They spent the night
on board, landed next morning at Port
Augusta. Their friendly call cost them
the boat-fare between the two ports and
six quid for a taxi-fare home.

“Rex”: “Zake” (B. 15/9/’4B) is wrong
when he says “plonk” was unknown to
the Old Diggers. The word was quite
common in South Australia before the
first war, especially in the Eudunda dis-
trict ; it referred to the cheap wines popu-
lar among the old German settlers. We
used to say “When a settler sells any of
his produce the first thing he buys is a
flagon of ‘plonk,’ the next his groceries
and lastly feed for his horses.”
* * * ♦
“Pasquin”: The report that an
American has been expelled from
Russian-occupied territory for photo-
graphing war installations, although the
only snap taken was of an ox-cart, a
peasant and a stone well, is quite under-
standable to those who have studied
“Bo’s” revelations of the superb prepared-
ness of the Soviet war machine. The ox-
cart is, of course, one of Russia’s modern,
fast-moving, transport units; what is
apparently a peasant to an eye not so
expert as “Bo’s” is a Russian infantryman
in full equipment; and the stone well is,
without doubt, the very latest in deep air-
raid shelters.
* * * ♦
“W.P.T.”: Indian timber from the ribs
and beams of the 112-year-old brigantine
Marie Laure, now a derelict in Port
Phillip (Vic.), is being made into fishing-
rods. Making useful articles and novelties
from old ships has been a popular hobby
in this country. Timber from the Ly-ee-
moon, wrecked at Green Cape in 1886,
was bought by a Monaro man who made
it up into whip-handles, pen-holders, ash-
trays and similar novelties, and many of
these articles are still preserved by
families in the district. When Riverina
ran aground at Mallacoota, many of the
fittings were used in the Cann River
Hotel, where they are still a source of
interest to tourists.

“G. Iris”: Diplomacy in occupied Ger-
many, A proposal to change the name
“Hindenburgstrasse” was under discus-
sion by the town councillors of Kunzel-
sau. Asked for advice, the American
Military Government ruled “If the Hin-
denburgstrasse was named in honor of
the Field-Marshal, then it must be
changed. If named in remembrance of
the German President, it need not be
changed.”
* * * *
“Spokeshave”; A Toorak hostess
whose ideas on the customs of foreign
nations are a little hazy entertained some
of the Italian operatics at afternoon-tea.
“What do you take with your tea?”
she asked archly to a prima donna.
“Sugar—or olive oil?”
♦ * * ♦
“Smilo”; Schoolchildren are perform-
ing quite a useful civic task in collecting
from pavements the discarded cigarette-
packets which contained the multifarious
brands of imported gaspers we see these
days. The kids call them “cigarette-
cards,” and play a competitive game for
their possession. How the youngsters’
eyes would sparkle if they could see the
colored cards which accompanied each
packet of cigarettes of 30 years ago—
the sets of Australian birds, Australian
wildflowers and animals, and the more
elaborate flags of all nations and kings
and queens of England (printed on silken
fabric) which their grandmothers deftly
converted into colorful cushion-covers.
This was in the “bad old days” when
smokes were cheap! Still, municipal
cleaners undoubtedly appreciate the
efforts of the youngsters.

“M.F.”: The trustees of the Nuffield
Foundation are offering seven travelling
Fellowships to begin in 1949 (three in
medicine, two in the natural sciences, one
in the humanities and one in the social
sciences). The purpose of the Fellow-
ships is to enable Australian graduates of
outstanding ability to gain experience and
training in the United Kingdom with a
view to equipping themselves to take up
senior posts in research and teaching in
Australia. A Fellow will be expected to
resume residence in Australia on the com-
pletion of the Fellowship. Applicants
should be between the ages of 25 and 35
years, preferably holding a Master’s or
Doctor’s degree with a year or more of
subsequent teaching or research experi-
ence on the staff of a university or com-
parable institution. The Fellowships will
normally be tenable for one year, and
will be of the value of between £6OO and
£BOO (sterling) per annum, exclusive of
travelling expenses. Application forms
can be obtained from the Nuffield Foun-
dation Australian Advisory Committee at
the University of Melbourne.
UNCONVINCING,
“Mr. Clarey, M.L.C., president of the A.C.T.U.,
said that there was no cause for public alarm
[about the Labor party’s socialisation plank]. No
industry could be socialised or nationalised without
the people’s consent.”
If that were so, when some new scheme is sprung
Upon the land and headlines are displaying it,
One might assume a Labor Government
Would seek some proof of popular consent
Before essaying it.
Vox populi, which Clarey rates so high,
They’d not the least compunction about letting
it
(When grabbing banks was on their programme)
slide,
Deeming they bad, however hard they tried,
No hope of getting it.
Had they but ascertained the people’s will,
Surveyed the project from a wider angle,
What time and trouble, also what a lot
Of money they’d have saved before they got
In such a tangle!
To those who’ve learned of what they’re capable
What value lies in the assurance airy
That nothing can be socialised without
The public’s acquiescence? Cut it out!
Come off it, Clarey!

IMPERIAL CHEMICAL INDUSTRIES OF AUSTRALIA AND NEW ZEALAND LIMITED
“Bo”: At this time of the year let us
all take a commiserating thought for a
small, though stout-hearted, band of self-
less, unsung heroes who, in Sydney, are
daily performing miracles of endurance.
Of the lives their wives and children
must necessarily lead when these heroes
are temporarily relieved of their arduous
toil I mercifully pass over except to
inquire of any wife how she would like
it if her lord were to raise himself off the
piljpw at intervals in the wee sma’ hours,
hoarsely declaim “Little Miss Muffet
sat on a tuffet” or break into shrill
renderings of “Sink, Red Sun,” repeated
endlessly, and then with a hopeless
and humorless “Har! Har! ”to sink back
uneasily until his tortured brain roused
him to more outbursts. I refer, of
course, to those gentlemen who are
adjudicating in the City of Sydney
Eisteddfod. I once attended an Eistedd-
fod and barely saved my reason by rush-
ing out after the 33rd rendition of
Handel’s “Where’er You Walk.” One
of these days I expect an adjudicator to
rise up more in anger than in sorrow,
and, leaping upon little Annie Thomp-
son as she is sawing her way through
Bach’s “Air on the G String,” tear the
tortured catgut from her fiddle and
strangle her with it. I’m sure the jury
would call it justifiable homicide.

“Zake”; In the long-ago days when I
was a wire-haired terror —of the barbers
—Snips was wont to spend anything tip
to 20 curseful minutes reducing my un-
ruly mop to something resembling order,
after which he would fling his blunted
scissors aside. For this service I coughed
up sixpence, and for several days after-
wards my topknot gave forth an aroma
like that of an Eastern houri. Now, my
coconut-fibre having mostly departed, the
usurious fellow in the white coat demands
two bob to nibble at the tenuous scrub
at the back of my neck between my
ears with his electric clippers and flick

“Cauboy” : Artists have overcome all
sorts of disabilities, some of the most
harrowing description, but there are some
that can’t be surmounted. An Australian
painter of murals lost his right arm in
the A.I.F. and taught himself to paint
• • .• .r* 1... „° . „
with his left, but a stone-blind artist, of
course, couldn’t paint at all. Complete
deafness did not prevent Beethoven writ-
big magnificent music, and he actually
conducted one of his own compositions
"No, Barney—you don't sound the ‘ K' in 'knowledge .’”
when he was so deaf that he could not
hear the cheering at the finish, and had to
be turned round to face the audience
before he realised he had scored his
greatest triumph. It is difficult to see
how a conductor could conduct, however,
if his spine wasn’t at least as responsive as
his fingers. This appears to be the case
with Sir Thomas Beecham, who, accord-
ing to a cable, conducted so vigorously
during his South African tour that his
spine was pushed on to a nerve and he
had to land in England in a bathchair.
His performances in Australia were such
as required the physique and condition
of a champion wrestler. If the specialists
can’t cure him his conducting days are
doubtless over unless he can grow a fresh
thatch and conduct with his hair like
Kubelik.
MC * * ♦
“F.S.”; Canberra is a whale for
“culture,” and I am not surprised
to hear that the Standing Committee
on Broadcasting has recommended
a grant of £50,000 to encourage
the composition of Australian music.
I will be surprised if one decent
piece of music comes of it. Included in
the recommendation is the establishment
qf travelling scholarships for promising
composers, use of the A.B.C. orchestras
to promote sales of Australian composi-
tions and the giving of composers’ fellow-
ships worth £5OO a year to persons
with proved creative capacity. The snag
is in the word “proved,” Who is to
“prove” that a young composer has
creative talent? No committee saw the
creative capacity in young Beethoven.
Almost to the end of his days he had to
resort to all sorts of devious dodges to
get his compositions published. No All-
party Parliamentary committee discovered
the talent in the youthful Wagner, and
if it hadn’t been for the patronage of a
few individual rich men his operas would
never have seen production.
* ♦ * •
“River Road”: The union organiser,
out collecting the quarter’s dues, wasn’t
worried about inflation, “If a loaf of
bread costs tuppence, and you’ve only got
a penny, things are crook,” he argued.
“If it costs two bob, and you’ve got two
bob, you’re all right.” “It’s even better
than that,” my mate agreed, “Before
the war, if an article cost five bob and
you only had four bob, you spent all your
money and only got part of what you
wanted. Now the same article costs a
quid, and you’ve got the quid, but you
can’t buy the blanky article because it
isn’t procurable, so you save your quid.”

“Taswegian”: “Gravelsnatcher’s” par.
about the Aussie p.-0.-w. who pruned
the German’s apple-trees brings me in
with my pruning story. A Hobart man
went to Adelaide for a holiday. Because
he hailed from the Apple Island, a friend
asked him to prune the backyard apple-
tree. He did. Next autumn his friend
sent him a copy of a paper with a photo,
of the tree bearing a magnificent crop.
with the caption “Pruned by a Tasmanian
expert.” The Tasmanian expert was
quite tickled about it; it was the first
apple-tree he’d ever pruned.

“C.Q.”; Melbourne Zoo, St. Kilda
Beach, Como Park, the Cricket Ground,
Kooyong Tennis Courts and the Alex-
andra and Fitzroy Gardens have all had
their claims pushed as sites for the sound-
shell the Hollway Government proposes
to construct, and somebody has even sug-
gested a barge floating on the Albert
Park lake or the perfumed bosom of the
Yam. The Yarra would be an ideal
situation for a pageant, but its acoustics
would be rotten.
♦ * * ♦
“Melbn”: An unexpected effect of the
projected Royal visit is to show up Mel-
bourne’s inadequacy as the queen city of
the south. The Victorian reception com-
mittee, with a fine imaginative impulse,
selected Armadale railway station as the
doorstep to the city. Immediately almost
every other suburban r.s, was up in arms,
and photos poured into the dailies of the
charms of the various would-be debarka-
tion centres. Unfortunately, each gateway
looked just as drab as any other, and
every alternative route whose charms
were canvassed turned out to have some
disadvantage or other, and none could
be found that had anything better to
offer for an architectural background
than a view of a ‘pub or a milkbar. The
impression gained is that Melbourne’s
civic guardians have left their run too
late. They ought to have started 50 yea is
ago with city planning. It is un-
reliably reported that the Government
will settle the disputing claims by landing
the Royal party on the roof of Govern-
ment House by helicopter.

“T.F.”: That hot-dog vendor who
closed the roll on his finger (B. 22/9/’4B)
did as good a job as one I saw at a picnic
race-meeting at Patchewollock (Vic.). He
put the saveloy in all right, but forgot to
sever it from its brothers, and away went
the customer with a string of “dogs”
jumping out of the pot behind him. With
a stricken look the hot-dog man rushed
after his pack and pinned the end one
with his boot. The leading sav. pulled
from its roll, and he gathered up the lot,
dusted them on his apron and returned
them to the pot.
“S.K.A.”: “K.V.’s” hot-dog vendor
(B. 22/9/’4B) didn’t originate the thumb-
and-tomato-sauce technique. Charlie
Chaplin pioneered the stunt in one of his
old silent pictures back in the days when
a hot-dog was still a sav.-and-roll.

“Dee”: In my days of sin and sorrow
I have partaken of oysters and whisky
at one fell swoop, only to fcass through a
recovery made more onerous by waiting
for symptoms of the prescribed mixture
hardening in my stomach to cause my
demise. It hasn’t happened yet, but I’ve
never been able to get a line on this old
belief sufficiently convincing to eliminate
my post-festive fears. Not long ago,
though, I found in Tasmania, where
oysters are scarce but crayfish plentiful,
an equally strong legend that a mixture
of whisky and crayfish would lead to the
same mortal consequences. Men in
Hobart pubs whose opinion I respected
solemnly warned me against the whisky-
and-crayfish diet, accompanying the warn-
ing with the customary anecdotes about
various deceased blokes whose departure
from this life abruptly coincided with a.
whisky-crayfish menu. Wonder how
many other attractive comestibles are
grouped with whisky as the artificers
of sudden death?
ARE QUIZZES EDUCATIONAL?
“A correspondent writes to ‘S. M. Herald’ hotly
denying that quiz sessions are educational and pro-
testing against ‘the parading of mostly useless in-
formation which any intelligent man could get
from a book of reference if he needed it.’ ”
But who’ll deny some good is done
And human knowledge broadened, more
Or less, by teaching anyone
Something he didn’t know before?
With learning for our lifelong task
Of weighty things or trivial
From any source, what need to ask
Are Quizzes educational?
Where else but in that pleasant strife
Of wits can full accounts be had
Of who was Pontius Pilate’s wife
-g Or what was Napper Tandy’s dad?
?;; The subjects that you couldn’t take
At school or glean from any pal
Are surely just the things that make
These Quizzes educational.
Can cyclopaedias supply
Answers to every line that trips
In rippling interrogatory
From many a smooth announcer’s lips?
Not much, be sure. And I’ll be bound
It’s dawned on many a boy and gal,
For much that can’t in books be found
A Quiz is educational.
Can anybody know too much,
From fathoming the origin
Of Sanskrit or of double-Dutch
To how to tell a Capuchin?
One, doubtful what a cuscus is,
Plant, reptile, bird or animal,
Might find its mention in a Quiz
Distinctly educational.
For me, whatever narks declare,
I give the game its rightful dues
For all I’ve gathered ’cross the air
From these symposia—or shivoos.
For sustenance that feeds the brain,
Tickles the fancy, too, I shall
Unhesitatingly maintain
Quizzes are educational.

THE SERVICE MAN
DEFENCE AND THE A.L.P.
In various spheres the develop-
ment of defence continued dur-
ing the week —except in Aus-
tralia, where, despite all camou-
flage, our policy is really dic-
tated by the big Communist-
controlled unions.
' These unions hold control of
the defence policy by weight of
authority. The Government has
allowed them to get into the posi-
tion in which, by lifting a finger,
certain members of the Com-
munist Central Committee can
paralyse whatever activity the
defence authorities are engaged
in, just as they have paralysed
trade with the Dutch in Indo-
nesia, and made it impossible for
the feeble Administration at
Canberra to send arms to save
Australian lives in Malaya ex-
cept in military ships or aircraft.
While Britain —hard-pressed,
overburdened Britain—and the
United States are rushing their
defence programmes with a
feverishness which shows that
they know all too grimly what
is in store, Australian defence
policy is being largely dictated
by Mimicking Molotovs.
The Government does not, of
course, make its own defence
policy exc'ept formally. At the last
triennial conference of the A.L.P.
(1945) Mr, Chifley went in per-
son, cap in hand, and asked the
conference to lay down a defence
policy for him. The facts are on
clear record in the official report.
He has now so far abdicated
his authority that the Govern-
ment of the country openly
acknowledges extra - constitu-
tional governing bodies.
The Federal executive of the
“Labor” party has assumed ex-
actly the same status as the Cen-
tral Committee of the Com-
munist party in Russia. It makes
the decisions. In its discussions
its members spoke last week of
what they would and would not
allow the Government to do.
They laid down a programme
which, while it sounds on the
surface imposing, still further en-
feebles the defence of this
country, and is calculated to
make the average decent Aus-
tralian bow his head in shame.
Most of its positive plans are
illusory.
For instance, it adopted a
theory of “co-operation with the
British Commonwealth of
Nations in order to assure co-
operative action against aggres-
sion” ; and another phantasy
which read: “Co - operation
within the British Common-
wealth of Nations in support of
U.N.O. for the purpose of
maintaining international
peace.”
Its co-operation, it was made
perfectly plain—despite the fact
that Mr. Riordan, the Navy
Minister, said in Parliament the
same day that Australian defence
plans had been made after con-
sideration of what Britain and
the United States cojuld do to-
wards our protection—is to be
limited to purely voluntary
effort. And that voluntary effort
is to bp limited very strictly.
The sum total of Australia’s de-
fence plan, as set out by the
A.L.P., is that we will “maintain
Australia as an integral part of
the British Commonwealth of
Nations” —that is, “Labor” will
allow the other parts of the
British Commonwealth, includ-
ing New Zealand, which is con-
templating conscription at the
moment, to do the maintaining
if it means sending men overseas
to fight, and those men want to
stay at home while Britain,
France, the United States and the
citizens of the Benelux countries
do the fighting for them.
Next, the platform calls for
“intense investigations of atomic
and biological warfare with a
view to development of adequate
protection of the civil popula-
tion.”
This is pure eyewash. Aus-
tralia has no means of “intense”
investigation of these matters.
Anyway, its only department
capable of making any investiga-
tion won’t do it, because its
scientists don’t believe in atomic
warfare, and the overseas coun-
tries which have a monopoly of
real atomic-defence knowledge
won’t part with their secrets be-
cause they know that every-
thing connected.with the “Labor”
Government of Australia seems
to be open to Communists or
ex-Communists.
Universal Service
Sufficient investigation cer-
tainly has taken place to lay
down a technique for “adequate
protection of the civil popula-
tion.” It has been accepted by
the Government and political
parties of every civilised country
in the world except Australia. It
has been particularly outlined by
the President’s Commission on
civilian defence in the United
States. And everywhere it is
agreed, except in Australia, that
the first essential will be com-
plete conscription of the whole
population, and that this con-
scription must take place in
peace-time so as to provide ade-
quate training for those involved.
It will be no use to start calling-
up men and women when the
atom or other bombs, the bac-
teria and the paratroopers begin
to fall; but that is what Mr.
Ferguson and his friends pro-
pose:—
The mobilisation of the resources
of the nation in the event of attack.
It is difficult to believe.
Government Control
Next clause,
The Labor programme calls for “a
national survey of all industries to
ascertain their potential value for de-
fence purposes.”
If a national survey is needed
at this stage, Heaven help the
country if it is invaded even by
Tonga or the Kuku Kukus. And
if any more can be done to pro-
duce “Government control of
the manufacture of munitions”
than is proposed to be done by
the new Supply and Develop-
ment Bill, which virtually gives
the Government power to
socialise the country for defence
purposes even in peace-time, only
Stalin and Vyshinsky would be
likely to think of it. There is,
in fact, nothing which the Gov-
ernment cannot do to industry
and nothing it cannot demand
from industry.

The voluntary system, as
planned by the Labor confer-
ence, provides for “the estab-

Herald” on September 30, it was
announced that in the biggest
city in the Commonwealth only
six men —three pilots and three
ground-staff—had enlisted in
Sydney’s air squadron in five
months, this in spite of the fact
that thousands of pounds were
squandered during that period
by the Government on useless
and expensive advertising. Of
30 who had applied for appoint-
ment to the ground-staffs of the
squadron, 27 proved to be un-
suitable.
The ground forces' are in the
same position. Except for the
Scottish battalions which attract
recruits by their own means the
enlistment in the Citizen Forces
has so far been a disgrace to the
country, and is undoubtedly dis-
couraged not only by the Com-
munist unions in which any
enlistee becomes a marked man,
but by Government departments.
Most units in the Citizen
Forces are headed by men know-
ledgeable, keen and enthusiastic
—enthusiastic enough to give
their Saturday afternoons to tour-
ing the football-grounds scratch-
ing up recruits and most of their
evenings to drill, administration
and the persuasion of local com-
mittees. All that is needed to
fill the ranks is a really whole-
hearted drive by th& Govern-
ment and its party members
and a public statement by the
big union leaders in support of
wholesale enlistments. But this
support is not forthcoming. If
we became Russia’s allies in her
aggressions every Communist
leader and every “Red” poli-
tician would be stumping the
country for recruits, and prob-
ably advocating conscription for
overseas service—in defence of
the Soviet Union —instead of
voluntary service at the behest
of that moribund tea-party the
“Security” Council, which can-
not even elect a new member
without ’hine or 10 ballots and a
violent quarrel among the elec-
tors of the Assembly who do the
choosing.
It was the unwilling entry of
Russia into the war, and that
only, which secured the toler-
ance of the ironworkers and
wharflaborers for even limited
compulsory service in 1942-45.
Their leaders made this abso-
lutely clear.
Treason and Sedition
This brings forward another
feature of the new “Labor”
policy, the one which properly
illuminates its realities.
Australia is the weakest
country in the world in respect
ot powers for dealing with
treason, treachery and sedition.
There is no Commonwealth
treason law. The Government
of what Mr. Calwell and Dr.
Evatt christened “the nation”
has to go cap in hand to a
State Crown Law authority to
secure a prosecution for treason,
and so far the only time it has
done so was for the purpose of
pursuing a military officer who
was anathema to the Com-
munist party.
The sedition laws are inherent
in the Crimes Act. The only
persons against whom it is con-
ceivable that this Act should be
used at the present time are the
Communist party or its sup-
porters.
It was proposed that the
Federal Labor conference should
declare publicly that the Com-
munist party is an outlaw or-
ganisation opposed to the plat-
forms of the Federal and State
Labor parties. It was also pro-
posed that Communists should
be debarred from Government
employment, particularly from
the Security and Transport ser-
vices.
All these proposals were
laughed out of court. The
“Labor” Government could not
at present declare the Com-
munist party illegal because, if it
did, the Communist party —
backed by politicians and fel-
low-travellers —would at once
retaliate, and “Labor” would
cease to have -any financial or
political support from the more
financial key unions. It could
not expel Communists from
Government employment for the
same reason. And it could not
declare that the Communist
party is a political party opposed
to the “Labor” platform because
the immediate objectives of both
“Labor” and Communism are
the same —the introduction of
socialisation, with the requisite
destruction of Parliament and its
replacement by a “workers’ ”
Government.
So the conference even turned
down as “undemocratic” a pro-
posal that the Federal Govern-
ment should take strong repres-
sive measures against the Com-
munists, contenting itself with a
feeble declaration, at which the
Communists will laugh heartily,
that Moscow’s emissaries are fol-
lowing a policy inimical to the
best interests of Australian
workers and that Labor men
must not mix with them —a
policy which is treated with
general contempt.
Stalin’s Spearhead
In order to make it clear to
the Communists that they have
a clear run and need take no
notice of mere scolding for the
purpose of deceiving the elector-
ates the conference decided to re-
affirm almost every plank which
the C.P. has on its “immediate”
platform, including the demand
for the abolition of the Trans-
port Workers’ Act and the re-
peal of those portions of the
Crimes Act dealing with in-
dustrial and “political” offences.
No substantive move was
made to ban association with
Communist bodies. No rule was
introduced to ban the “Labor”
party from accepting contribu-
tions from Communist-managed
unions. Nothing was done to
prevent affiliated unions from
electing Communists as delegates
to A.L.P. State annual confer-
ences, at which “Labor” defence
policy is made.
The Communist party remains
an ever-strengthening section of
the “Labor” governing machine.
The Government and its party
appears to be in defence matters
at the mercy of an organisation
which, even the day after Hitler
attacked his Russian allies and
Britain and every other civilised
country had hurried to the
Soviet Union’s aid, wrote in its
illegal organ:
[Their] blows on Germany do not
alter the character of the ruling
monopolists in our own country or
any other The first duty of the
Communists today, as since 1917, is
the preservation of the spearhead of
the socialist transformation of the
world —the Union of Soviet Socialist
Republics.

“W.E.F.”: Sydney’s Swinburne Press
is getting ready a limited edition of The
Silver Branch, a collection of 27 poems
by Dulcie Deamer, for which Norman
Lindsay has drawn a handsome dust-
cover. As far back as 1907, Dulcie, then
a girl in her teens living at Wairarapa
(N.Z.), won a “Lone Hand” short-story
competition, and it was Norman, 10
years her senior and already famous, who
illustrated the story, “As It Was in the
Beginning,” a lively tale of primeval pas-
sion in the days of the caveman. There
are some readers who can still recall the
end:
j.. .The tense strength of his arms made
her green eyes swim liquidly, and their
warm breaths mingled as he fondled her.
Outside the five carcasses stiffened in their
congealing blood, and in the bleak dark-
ness the wolves lifted their noses to the
eternal stars and mourned.
Since then Dulcie’s pen has never been <
idle. She has written six novels, several
books of verse, plays, volumes of short
stories and innumerable articles. As busy
as she always is with her writings, Dulcie
engages in a whirl of social activities, and
more than 20 years ago was crowned the
“Queen of Sydney Bohemia,” a title she
still retains. A centre of attraction at the
annual Artists’ Ball—-for years she
attended the affair attired in a leopard-
skin —Dulcie is now planning a surprise
for this year’s event, which will be held
at the Trocadero on Guy Fawkes night.
Swinburne Press hopes to have the new
book out by the end of this month.
Retiring from what some citizens would
regard as a losing battle, Ansell Clarke,
foreman ratcatcher of the Melbourne
City Council. With his teams of highly-
intelligent canines, his smoke apparatus
and other devices for defeating the
rodents, which he considers not very in-
telligent at all, he has warred against the
plague for 30 years. Last year he and
his assistants accounted for 6480. His
experience discounts one popular theory
—that if female rats are eliminated the
disappointed males slaughter one an-
other.
The easiest way to describe India’s
new High Commissioner to Australia, Lt.-
Col. Daya Singh Bedi, is to say he looks
astonishingly like Ronald Colman.
Educated in pothooks at Rawalpindi, and
military strategy at Sandhurst, he was
commissioned in the Indian Army in
1921, serving therein until his country’s
Foreign and Political Department claimed
him seven years later. From then on
he was stationed mainly on the N.-W.
Frontier and in Baluchistan, at mountain
stations with names like memories of
P. C. Wren and Kipling—Quetta, Loralai,
Hazara, Kurram and Rajputana. Colonel
Bedi is the lineal descendant of Guru
Nanak, founder of the Sikh religion, and
his family is naturally held in the highest
respect by Sikhs throughout India. Aus-
tralia will be able to accommodate him
in most of his sports—coursing, polo and
fishing—but the favorites, falconry and
pigsticking, must remain nostalgic sub-
jects for reminiscences with his Sikh bat-
man, who has been with him for the
past 24 years.
“Trinco”: General George Kenney’s surprise
retirement from chief of the U.S. Strategic
Air Force Command ends the service life
of the brilliant strategist who called Aus-
tralia his “favorite continent.” His men called
him the “ ‘Hell, let’s try it’ guy.? The sobriquet
summed up pretty well the man who, given
command of the Far East Air Forces in August,
1942, with fewer than 12 Flying Fortresses, built
it up through the desperate vicissitudes of the
early New Guinea and island campaigns to the
vast air fleets that roared in unchallengeable
supremacy over MacArthur when he landed on
Leyte. Scrounging and borrowing planes and
parts, Kenney in 1942 went to work on the
Japs just landed on New Guinea. He was the
first to fit 30-calibre Brownings in the wings
of an old fighter, and eight guns plus the 75mm.
cannon in the nose of a B-25. Then he origi-
nated an air evolution which accounted for hun-
dreds of enemy planes. When MacArthur fol-
lowed up the Australians’ success on the Kokoda
Trail with assaults on Buna and Gona, Kenney
was behind him with an entire division lifted
by air without a single casualty. His most
devastating single blow was delivered by his
B-25’s, Fortresses, Lightnings and Australian
Beaufighters at the Jap Bismarck Sea convoy.
Over 90 Zeros were shot down, 22 ships were
sunk and between 15,000 and 18,000 Japs sent
to watery graves. Kenney’s initial experience was
gained in the first scrap, when he shot down
two planes and followed them himself shortly
after. A small, whipcord shape, notably un-
handsome, with a grin as wide as the Panhandle,
his numerous decorations weren’t awarded for
his beauty alone.
The Religious Editor —or it may have
been the Marine Editor —changing a book
at Sydney Municipal Library, noticed
a rich, ripe, fruity smell rising from
somewhere beneath. It led him be-
hind R. E. Lay, manager of Penfold’s
Sydney branch, down into the firm’s
extensive cellar. This, then, was
the height of a grape’s ambition. In a
huge concrete cave beneath the unsuspect-
ing feet of footpath-walkers in Market-,
York- and George-streets lies a quarter of
a million gallons of wine—from sherry
and port and muscadine to dusty bins ot
champagne and Tokay. Huge vats —one
holds 10,000 gallons—reach back into the
shadows in ordered array, and from one
hogshead a pump was pouring its liquid
fragrance into a revolving filling machine.
Some of the casks, taller than a man, are
of British oak 90 years old. Watching
over this treasure is I. D, Downey, who
knows as much about wine as his 47
years’ tasting, smelling and bottling it
should have taught him.
Dr. Frederick Morgan, who sat with
Judge Barry as “scientific assessor” in the
“Whose baby is whose?” case in Mel-
bourne, has been director of the vast
Commonwealth serum laboratories at
Parkville since 1927. Born at Glenelg
(S.A.), he was schooled at Geelong
Grammar. An early bent put him on
the path of bacteriological research, and
he has made a lifetime job of it. In the
late war his institution turned out bio-
logical supplies, and the battle against
malaria, dengue, swamp-fever and other
New Guinea enemies was largely fought
from there.
With the Melbourne Show again upon
us, so appears the name of Bartram.
Here presented by Mcßeath is Harold
of the name, whose stud-farm at Heidel-
berg produces the horses which year after
year, ridden by wife and daughter, have
collected almost enough blue ribbons
and trophies to stock a museum. A fair
idea of the Bartram clean-up in various
sections is demonstrated by the fact that
at one Melbourne Royal the trio secured
33 prizes for horse and pony events and
on another occasion mother and daughter
won in the same year the senior and
junior Garryowen equestrienne turnout,
one of the most coveted trophies of the
Australian show-ring. Daughter Mary
holds the record for the youngest
girl to ride over fences and won her first
event at three. Apart from champion
horses, the Bartram household shows, or
has shown, Shetland ponies, cattle, dogs,
chooks, Persian cats with blue eyes,
needlework and cookery, while a parrot

once entered talked himself into first
place. Son of the late H. W. Bartram,
one-time captain of the Victorian inter-
state tennis team, later veteran champ
of England and winner of Sweden’s King
Haakon trophy, young Harold was taken
to England as a lad and rowed No. 4
for Trinity, Cambridge, when it won
against Oxford in 1906. He manufactures
dairying machinery, is on the council of
the R.A.S. and served in the first world
melee.
From a “snotty” to the R.A.N.’s No. 1
communications appointment in a quarter
of a century is the record of Commander
J. L. Bath, R.A.N., who assumed the
directorship of naval communications in
Melbourne early last month. He came
ashore from a two-year command of
destroyer Quiberon, a unit of the Jap-
anese-occupation force. A specialist in
signals and radar, he was commanding
officer of the Navy’s war-time radar
school and later commanded its radar-
training base. Bath saw service in cruiser
Hobart as flag-lieutenant and squadron
signals-officer to Rear-Admiral J. G.
Grace, then commanding H.M.A.
Squadron. He received his brasshat in
June, 1946.
Author of They Struck Opal : —
“The name’s Ted Murphy, I was born 86f
years ago, and they didn’t call me Paddy. Of
course, I’m good for a while yet—brother dead
at 98 and another in Melbourne nearly 90.
Y’ know, the Red Page gave my book more
than a fair go—it brought me in touch again
with the old-timers of the opal-fields. From
all oyer Australia they’ve written in: ‘Remember
the time I brought in fifty quids’ worth of opal
from White Cliffs and you gave me a measly
ten?’ And, ‘You wouldn’t know White Cliffs
now, Ted —she’s a real ghost town.’ That’s be-
cause of the 40-hour week and flash wages in
the city—opal-gouging’s too hard for the young
bloke today. You wouldn’t recall the big Wee
Waa flood in 1910? I remember a boozer there
—no name, no courtmartial —who wouldn’t be
held back from fording the river. Down near
the bank a young frog croaked to him, ‘Only
TED MURPHY, opal-gouger.
knee-deep, only knee-deep.’ ‘Thanks, cobber,’
said the boozer, and went on. Then he met
an old frog who yelled ‘Go back, go back!’
So he did, and passed the first joker. ‘Only
knee-deep, only knee-deep,’ he was still croak-
ing. ‘Shut up, you fool,’ snarled the boozer.
‘Only for your old man I mighta been
drowned!’ Ah, yes, in those days I’d buy
fifty thousand quids’ worth of opal a year. I
bought lon Idriess’s first stone at Lightning
Ridge. He reckoned in his book there’s no
man living who knows more about opals than
Ted Murphy. That was decent of him, but —
now, young feller, if you want to draw me I’ve
got a picture here when I was about 30. If
you’d like to use that? No? Oh, well, all
right—but don’t make a feller look ridiculous.”
Rosemary Rees, author of “Sing a
Song of Sydney,” pronounced by the
London “Mail” as the best romantic
story of the year, left her native Maori-
land this month for England. She turns
out a novel every year for a wide circle
of readers who like light feminine
romance. Originally an actress, she
toured M.L. with her own company after
the first scrap, did well in the cities,
flopped in the provinces and arrived back
in Sydney practically penniless. Desper-
ate, she wrote a novel in six weeks. It
was accepted by a London publisher,
with an invitation to forward others on
the same lines. Since then she has never
looked back. A versatile lady, for a
while she appeared in silent films in
America.
The highest post in the State’s teaching
service, principal of Melbourne High
School, is now filled by George Langley,
an ex-old-boy .whose dream when he
started in the department was just that.
A soldier like his predecessor, A. H.
Ramsay, now Director-elect of Education,
Langley served in the first war, collecting
a D. 5.0., and was a brigadier in
the second. With peace, he went to
Rajputana as a Red Cross Commissioner.
Cricketer Bill Woodfull, now acting-prin-
cipal, will be vice-principal.
This is a Chester impression of T. E.
Maloney, Commissioner for Queensland
Railways, who lays no claim to meteoric
advancement —just quiet tenacity of pur-
pose that lifted him from a lad porter at
the turn of the century to Commissioner,
T. E. MALONEY, railwayman.
climbing through most grades in between.
He started well; at just under 11 years
he won a scholarship from the Cabool-
ture (Q.) State school to Brisbane Boys’
Grammar, the effort calling forth sur-
prised and gratified comment from the
Education Department. Now, after 50
years with the railways, Maloney knows
all the answers. In his day a Rugby- and
soccer-player—first-grade in the latter—
he has one son, a practising barrister in
Brisbane who heard of his B.A. and
LL.D. degrees while away on active ser-
vice in the last shindy.
The lot of menial patients has been
considerably publicised of late ; R. Shore,
hon. secretary of the Diabetic Associa-
tion of Australia, offers some informa-
tion on the country’s diabetics. In Syd-
ney five clinics deal with 80 patients every
week; and there are about 50,000 dia-
betics in Australia. Few healthy people
realise the burden diabetics must carry
with them every day of their lives. There
is no complete cure —insulin controls—
and existence is governed by hypodermic
syringes, diet-charts, urine and Weight
tests and the constant fear of fainting. It
is hoped to establish a permanent school
in N.S.W. to educate the thousands of
sufferers in wiser control of their sick-
ness ; and any undecided philanthropist
need search no further for a good cause.
Shore edits the association’s Quarterly,
“The Australian Diabetic,” in which a
panel of diabetic specialists nominated by
the B.M.A. do their best to reach and
treat country people, who have no clinics.
Into the silence:
At 93, in Geelong, the Rev. F. J. Watsford,
known as the “father of Methodism in Vic-
toria.” He worked in a warehouse and bank
before entering the ministry in 1881.
At Kilmore (Vic.), Brother Sebastian (Michael
Napier). Sydney St. Joseph’s College old boys
will remember him as the roan who coached
their football teams to four consecutive premier-
ships.
In New York, Vernon Dalhart, writer of the
well-known “Prisoner’s Song.” The tune was used
in Australian Flying Corps’ messes for their
song “Hoorah for the Next Man to Die,”
banned by many squadron c.os. in the last war.
In Melbourne, at 51, Dr. lan Thomas
Cameron. He served with 2/9 Aust. Field
Ambulance in Malaya and spent three years
at Changi caring for the Eighth Division’s sick.
At 73, H. Bremner Lewis, former president
of Royal Melbourne Hospital and a promi-
nent Presbyterian layman. A solicitor by pro-
fession, in charitable work he was indefatigable.
At Parkville (Vic.), at 83, Rev. Frank Milne,
minister of the local College Church for 35
years. He came out from Aberdeen in 1891 and
was a chaplain in the Boer War and First War.
At Ivanhoe (Vic.), Mrs. W. C. Hill, widow
of the former Federal member for Echuca
who was Minister for Mines and Railways. She
was a life governor of the Victorian Blind
Institute.
In Sydney, at 75, Major John Russell King,
g.-m. of The Producers’ Co-op. Distributing
Society. In Africa during the Boer War, he
joined up and was wounded at the siege of
Mafeking. Returning home, he helped to estab-
lish the Coastal Farmers’ Co-op. Society, and
while in London supervising its butter market-
ing joined up again for World War I. He
won a D.S.O. A forceful personality, he was
g.-m. until the end.


Women's Letters
From Sydney
Derby Day, showery in the morning,
was all sulky cloud and peevish wind
during the afternoon. Did the A.J.C.
call off the Randwick meeting? Cer-
tainly not. The show must go on, especi-
ally when there is an audience of almost
72,000. So full of faith in their own
judgment were the populace that crowds
were waiting for the gates to open, and
had lined up at the totes by 11 o’clock. By
the start of the first race you could just do
a snail’s crawl about the backs of the
stands, and without seeing them this
Letter is ready to bet that the feet of
half the men she met wdre iron-shod.
Women’s hats have never been prettier,
more demure, and more defiant of the
heavens than they were last Saturday.
All the lovely pre-war straws turned up
again. They were flower-decked and
veiling-swathed. They were tied under
the chin with tulle. They were large.
They were small. All were winners. One
dream hat was a Leghorn with one palely-
green rose at the crown, and a narrow
edging of soft-green feather around its
brim. Hatpins were large of head, pearly,
opalescent, or diamente. Gilt or brass
buttons were worn on suit and topcoat
fore and aft.
The Governor’s daughter, Elizabeth
Northcott, wore a white straw hat, small
and off the face. It was looped
under her pointed chin with veiling. Its
golden blooms toned in with her summer-
weight coat. It was a day for coats, even
for furry wraps. Debs and sub-debs took
a chance in sleeveless silks and cottons,
but suits and ensembles were prevalent
and umbrellas were carried. It was the
usual Spring meeting tussle between
wearing clothes suitable for the weather
or blooming out in all one’s new finery.
Victoria’s popular Vice-regal Dugans
were there. Lady Dugan’s large hat was
of navy straw ; her suit was of navy-and-
white check. Up from Austinmer with
her father was Mrs. Frank Rogers. Her
suit of soft woollen was hydrangea-blue,
and her small dark-blue hat was swathed
and tied on with yards of veiling. Mrs.
Del. Morrow covered her silk frock with
a mink coat; her small black, off-the-
face hat had a graceful sweep of coq
feathers. With her was Mrs. N. Somer-
field, smart in all-black. Springlike was
Mrs. Russell Catts’s outfit, and her rose-
trimmed hat was of white velvet. With
her navy suit Mrs. Woodward Pearce
wore a large white hat with dark-blue
chiffon drapes fringed with white to tie
under the chin.
Victoria Barracks stepped out smartly
in the dress parade in the persons of
Lieut.-General Berryman’s wife and Mrs.
J. Mann. Mrs. Berryman was trigness in
black and Mrs, Mann wore a soft shade
ot jade-blue in frock and hat; this was
of Breton-sailor type with upturned brim.
Mrs. B. Wright’s outfit was teal-blue. Not
to be overlooked was Johneen Johnson’s
penny-bronze moires worn with a straw
hat of nutmeg-brown. Mrs. Eustace
Hollingdale was with Mrs. John Flynn.
From Neutral Bay came Mrs. Russell,
smart in navy and white, with Sydney
visitor Mrs. T. Leitch attending her first
race-meeting at Randwick. Charm, a mole
corduroy suit and a wide straw hat were
noted on Mrs. Bill Adams. With her were
Phyllis Reid, of Adelaide, and Mrs. L.
Teece, graceful in black. Nancy Mac-
naught, in hydrangea-blues and a large
white felt hat, Mrs. Marcel Dekyvere,
Pat Bowerman, Mrs. Millard Hagon,
Jennifer Street, Mrs. Joe Coen, and Mrs.
H. R. Allen were notable. Mrs. Alan
Potter was there with daughter Susan.
After-the-races parties raged in and
around the city last Saturday, Cocktails
were handed out in lavish style in the
Macquarie Club. There was the
Bachelors’ and Spinsters’ dance for bright
young things at Elanora Golf Club. All
the shows were packed out. On Monday
night there was a full-house at the Tivoli
for the new short season of Rambert
Ballet. Last night the long-looked-
forward-to Black-and-White Ball was the
glittering star. Today is Ladies Day at
Randwick; and the late-afternoon party
is being staged by the Australian Club.
That promises to be a sort of orchid-and-
pearl partnership in parties. Also, at
1 p.m. today, at the Australian Book
Society’s lunch Clement Hosking, presi-
dent of the Folk-Lore Association, will
speak on “The Unwritten Lore.” Then
on the 11th, 15th and 18th Sydney will
have a touch of Spain in the La Joselito
company.
North Shore-liners are looking forward
to next Saturday’s fair in the gardens of
the Misses Keam, of Lindfield. This is
an American tea, but already there are
enough gifts to furnish two stalls. Y. W.'s
president, Mrs. C. P. Johnson, opens the
fete at two o’clock.
Paul Klecki, who came to this country
as guest conductor for the A.8.C., was
his gorgeous best last Thursday night. To
see him wooing the first violins, flirting
with the woodwinds, sometimes a bit
stern, not to say bossy, with the ’cellos
and the second violins, was enthralling.
Paul is a conductor who throws every
nerve and fibre into the argument, and
the Town Hall audience went wild over
him. Tschaikowsky’s “Pathetique Sym-
phony” closed the programme on an up-
roar of applause, which at length evoked a
speech from the Polish musician. His
was a graceful speech of thanks for “the
kindness and warm-hearted friendliness”
he had received during the three months
of his stay in “your lovely land.” Women
in the audience were intensely conscious
of the pianist in the “Emperor” concerto.
She was pretty and graceful Hephzibah
Menuhin, who, with her slimness, her
golden head and her calm expression,
seemed like an angelic visitation in a
frock for which any woman might, if not
sell outright, at least mortgage her soul.
It was filmy fullness in shell-pink mar-
quisette and lace lightly dusted with
rhinestones.
. The girl who gazes so tranquilly out
of this photograph is Amy Conway, of
Lake Cargelligo, who will become the
bride of Allan Stevenson, of Stratheden,
Tamworth, at St. Peter’s, Watson’s Bay,
during this month. Amy’s Army service
extended over six years, during which
time she was attached to the Manunda.
Later she was Sister-in-Charge of Dubbo
13th Australian Camp Hospital, and still
later she was attached to 2/9 A.G.H.,
A.I.F. Sister Conway saw service in the
Middle East, Darwin, Moresby, Milne
Bay, and Morotai. Photograph by Noel

If you think that all of Julius Caesar’s
correspondence was on the lines of “I
came, I saw, I conquered,” read (as indeed
every woman you meet seems to be do-
ing) Thornton Wilder’s “The Ides of
March.” The Caesar revealed by the
letters to and from him is a very different
figure of a man from the one you pain-
fully followed, in your schooldays,
throughout his Gallic wars. Listen to
this, written, according to Thornton
Wilder, at eight o’clock in the morning:
“My Dear Wife, —I ask your pardon for
having left the house this morning with-
out answering your last question.” That
might have been penned by any Rotariar
to a loved but somewhat trying wife.
Kindergarten Union’s Polly King must
have been very gratified to see the pro-
cession of people streaming into the Edu-
cation Galleries last Wednesday. Cock-
tails and the food that goes with them, a
little singing, a little dancing to a pleasant
jazz-band made up the entertainment.
Hostesses were the women’s committee
of the Royal Art Society. Those who
came early had a chance to do a tour
of the beauty on the walls, for the
R.A.S. exhibition is still showing, but late-
comers had the view blocked by a frieze
of chairs adorned by humans along the
gallery walls. Dargie’s “Irish Girl,” now
bought by the National Gallery, came in
for much admiration.

and 9.
From Melbourne
Sixty years ago the Countess of Meath,
on a visit to this city, founded a Minis-
tering Children’s League, just as she had
done in London. It is very much a live
body today. Two holiday homes are
open all the year round ; doctors, school-
teachers and hospitals keep in touch with
the League, and no child, in need of a
holiday after an illness, is ever turned
away. It takes an extra £lOOO every
year to support the Boys’ Home at
Sandringham, and to raise the money a
shop is opened for 10 days, Glen’s
Music Warehouse allows the League a
window in its Collins-street establish-
ment and space inside for selling and
wrapping. A well-stocked shop was
opened to the public last Monday, and
among the donations for sale was a 200-
year-old handloomed cashmere shawl.
On the first day the executive committee,
headed by the president, Mrs. Walter
Carnegie, the hon. secretary, Mrs. God-
frey Howitt, and the organising secretary,
Mrs. Mary Hewison, were in charge, but
the following days were given to the
various branches, who stocked the shop
with fresh goods and also provided the
sales staff.
Another “House Full” sign was out at
His Majesty’s Theatre for the premiere of
The splendors of the 16th-
century costumes worn on the stage with
their wide, farthingale skirts and bodices
slashed with the blue of sapphires and the
red of rubies had their modern counter-
part in the dressing of the audience. The
wide, full-skirted black velvet gown worn
by Mrs. Norman Spry was allied to an off-
white bodice sparkling with gold sequins.
Mrs. lan Macfarlan’s slim-fitting black
silk chiffon gown had a wide band of
cream Guipure lace across the top of the
low-cut bodice. Mrs. Colin Macfarlan
wore blue and silver lamd with her white
Arctic-fox bolero. Mrs. D. Triaca’s white
crepe Grecian-cut gown was worn with
gold accessories. One of the most
luxurious fur coats seen at the opera was
worn by Germana Di Giulio, a member
of the opera company. It was full-
length, of silver-fox.
Flashing swords held high by brother
officers of the bridegroom’s regiment, the
Royal Melboyrne, made an impressive
arch under which Lynette Ariel Lee and
Captain Kenneth Stuart McKenzie walked
after their marriage at Scotch College’s
Littlejohn Memorial Chapel. The bride,
is the youngest daughter of Mr. and
Mrs, F. R. Lee, wore a classical gown
of magnolia satin, made with a fitting
bodice which had long tight-fitting
sleeves, and a full-trained skirt. Her
veil of Brussels lace, which was lent by
the ’groom’s mother, was held by a
coronet of pearls and she carried cream
roses. Bridesmaids were the bride’s
sister Bunty, Elizabeth McCutcheon and
the bridegroom’s sister, Margaret. Their
ballerina-length frocks of white-flowered
Swiss organdie over shell-pink taffeta
were worn with pale-pink satin sashes
and they carried pink roses. The bride-
groom, who is the youngest son of Mrs.
K. A. McKenzie, of Hawthorn, and the
late Brigadier McKenzie, had Capt. K.
Newton as best man and Capts. R. Law-
rence and T. Tripp were ’groomsmen.
Capt. B. Hearn and Lieut. lan Wilton
were ushers at the Chapel.
Reception was held at No. 9 Darling-
street. Mrs. Lee, mother of the bride,
wore a honey-beige crepe frock, the
skirt being draped; her large natural-
straw hat had black straw under the wide
brim, and black velvet and veiling made
effective trimming. Mrs. McKenzie’s
dove-grey suit had a braided peplum
jacket; her off-the-face black hat was
swathed with black tulle. Mrs. Sidney
Baillieu Myer wore a blue-and-black
feathered hat with her black frock. Mrs.
Sam‘McKay’s tailored frock of navy
carried white pique revers and cuffs ; her
navy beret of taffeta had a rolled brim
of matching straw. Mrs. J. Keith Kiddle’s
beige frock, with its lace insertion, was
worn with a matching wool coat and a
small hat of ribbon rosettes. Her
daughter, Mrs. W. J. Jamieson, chose a
printed frock and a red coat with revers
of the frock material; cherries trimmed
her small red hat. Mrs. Tom Fogarty
wore a brown hat massed with pink tulle
with her chocolate-brown suit, A beige
lace-trimmed frock and black hat
trimmed with parma-violet were Pat Tul-
loch’s choice. Brigadier Bernard Evans,
D. 5.0., proposed the toast of the happy
couple.
The Melbourne Racing Club’s spring
meeting at Caulfield was held on the sort
of day over which poets rhapsodise. Mrs.
W. Pultney Mein, who hostessed a
luncheon party, wore a blue-feather-
winged small black hat and black tailored
coat with smocked shoulders. Her
daughter, Mrs. Alison Stuart, was in navy
and a small white corduroy-velvet hat
trimmed with navy taffeta. Mrs. G. H.
Davey’s jacket-suit was of beige wool, her
matching beret trimmed with brown. Mrs.
J. C. Reilly, wife of the secretary of the
newly-formed club, chose a jacket-suit of
marine-blue and a small green-velvet hat
embellished with crimson roses. Mrs.
Bob Gove’s grey tailored suit was worn
with a matching velvet hat which carried
long feather quills. Mrs. G. Pennefather
offset her grey suit with a light-amber-
toned felt hat swathed with matching
veiling. Mrs. T. Lewis had a swathing
of mink across the shoulders of her beech-
brown jacket-suit; her small natural-straw
bonnet was trimmed with bows of leaf-
green taffeta. Mrs. H. Reed’s simple
black frock was worn with a black-edged
white straw Ifat trimmed with cornflowers.
One of the most striking and beautiful
gowns ever seen on the stage of the
Town Hall was worn by Anne Ziegler
when, with Webster Booth, she gave a
delightful recital of modelrn songs and
operatic excerpts. Made with a tight-
fitting bodice with straps of diamente
and a billowing crinoline skirt, it was
fashioned of French silk chiffon patterned
in a huge floral design of deep rose-pink,
mauve and green, with the centres of
the flowers massed with opalescent
sequins. With it the singer wore long
gloves of pale-lavender suede. In the
large audience were sisters Mrs. Desmond
Hollywood and Mrs. Peter Parker. Both
wore black frocks under dyed-ermine
coats. Cecil Tail wore a formal gown of
black Chantilly lace, the skirt formed of
graduated frills of the lace ; her wrap
was of dyed ermine. Mrs. Frank Tait
was in a black gown and silver-fox fur
wrap.
Margaret Elizabeth (Peggy), elder
daughter of Lady Fraser, of Toorak, and
the late Sir Colin Fraser, has announced
her engagement to Henry Vesey, only son
of Mrs. J. L. Casson, of Sheffield Terrace,
London, and the late Mr. Casson. Peggy,
who is one of this city’s attractive girls
and an ardent worker for many charitable
causes, will marry in November at the
Toorak Presbyterian Church, and in De-
cember will leave with her husband for
England.
To celebrate the engagement of their
son Kevin to Moira, daughter of Dr, and
Mrs. Percy Shelton, P. L. Coleman,
M.L.C., and Mrs. Coleman gave an
informal dance at Queen’s-road Private
Club. One hundred guests responded to
the toast of the happy couple proposed
wittily by John X. O’Driscoll. Mrs. Cole-
man received her guests in a gown of
Patou-pink lace with the pattern outlined
with tiny crystal beads. The bodice of
Mrs. Shelton’s pale-lilac crepe gown was
outlined with deeper sequins. Moira’s
bouffant gown of midnight-blue tulle was
fashioned with a tight-fitting shirred
bodice with diamente shoulder-straps; a
wide band of the skirt was appliqued
with tiny velvet circles centred with bril-
liants. Deep-violet taffeta broadly-striped
in shades of rose and green was chosen
for the gown worn by Moira’s sister, Mrs.
W. Martin. Black Chantilly lace over pink
taffeta formed Mrs. Royden Honeyman's
gown, the off-the-shoulder bodice of
which was finished with large rose& of
black and pink tulle centred with gold
sequins. Joan Silk’s gown was of grey-
and-white-striped taffeta allied to a black
velvet bodice. Ann England’s gown was
of midnight-blue taffeta.
Mrs. Ray Joseph’s unusual gown was
of floral satin, the bodice having an off-
the-shoulder neckline and long tight-
fitting sleeves. Pat Whittam wore an
ivory-taffeta gown with the bouffant skirt
finished with a wide striped hem. Her
sister Yvonne’s white organza frock was
spotted in red, and white ruffles edged with
red outlined the off-the-shoulder neck-
line ; ruffles were also used on the full
skirt. Mrs. Frank O’Collins’s soft-green
taffeta gown had the skirt draped to the
back, to form a bustle. Her daughter
Maeve wore deep-red velvet. An
American Beauty crepe gown with a blue
crepe folded bodice was Sylvia Hendy’s
choice. Mollie Westhoven, soon to be
a bride, wore pinky-beige crepe, the skirt
cut on slim lines and the bodice lavishly
trimmed with gold sequins. A pale-pink
lace and beaded bodice and burgyndy-
velvet skirt which carried a cluster of
roses in pink and burgundy tonings made
neat effect for Mrs. C. Curtain.

It was a difficult year for the brewers,
and, in the absence of a lift in the selling
price of beer, the road ahead might be-
come even more difficult before it gets
easier. For over a decade now expanding
turnover has taken care of mounting
costs, including substantial lifts in excise.
Beer consumption per head of population
in Australia rose from 10.34 gallons in
1936-37 to 13.45 gallons in 1945-46, and
shot up to 15.94 gallons in 1946-47. It
eased slightly for the year to June 30 last,
as the following comparison of excise col-
lections on the stuff suggests:
Year to Year to
June 30. June 30.

t Federal Statistician’s figures. * Budget figures.
For the first time since 1939 the figures
turned in the wrong direction last year,
when the drop (£202,827) was 7 p.c. as
against a rise of approximately 21 p.c. in
the previous year. And since 1939 excise
has stepped up from Is. 9d. to 4s. 7d. a
gallon, which means that the Government
now makes off with 14s. 7d. of every £1
the brewer receives for bulk beer. The
other ss. sd. has to cover increased pro-
duction and distribution costs, as well as
profits, which are twice taxed, first as co.
earnings and then as dividends in the
hands of shareholders.
Last term a strike at Sydney’s breweries
interrupted production during the last
half of the period ; hops were scarce and
dear, and some had to be imported; the
price of sugar, barley and other brewing
ingredients rose, too, and so did the basic
wage and margins for skill, while the 40-
hour week aggravated the whole un-
healthy situation —apart from the effect
of the time factor on costs, the shorter
working week is equivalent to a 10 p.c.
lift in hourly wage-rates.
After providing for depreciation
(£33,810, up £1053) there was a slip of
£134,714 in gross earnings:
1940. 1945. 1947. 1948.

Exes., which include excise and an un-
specified provision for taxation, were got
back £124,905, reducing the contraction
in net earnings to £9809. The £149,164
of profit was 8.6 p.c. on capital as against
9.1, 9, 8.8, 8.6, 8.6, 8.3 and 7.8 p.c. back
to 1941, The div. was kept at 8 p.c., and
£5OOO was sent to the staff fund, leaving
£5546 to put on the shelf. Whether the
co, did any better than stated depends
upon what amount, if any, was spent on
capital account and charged to revenue.
Plant was maintained in “a high state of
efficiency” out of earnings. If the Federal
Treasurer’s estimate of an increase of
£2i millions in excise from beer during
the current financial year is realised, the
increased turnover will help offset mount-
ing costs, which have not yet reached the
top of the hill.

The co. is in the woolbroking, pastoral-
finance and agency business in N. S.
Wales and Queensland. It was mainly
the high price of wool and livestock that
put the spring of £13,955 in the latest
profit figure; increased turnover in the
produce and Brisbane machinery depart-
ments helped, too, and so did abolition
of War-time (Co.) Tax. Costs advanced
in all directions, and they haven’t been
halted yet.
The £78,341 of profit claimed —the best
yet —was 14.2 p.c. on capital as against
11.7, 10.4, 9.4, 10.3, 9 and 6.8 p.c. back to
1942. A couple of points were added to
the div., making it 9 p.c., of which 1 p.c.
is labelled bonus. Except in 1942, whSn
6 p.c. was paid, the rate was steady at
7 p.c. for the preceding nine years. The
board also considered the position and
outlook good enough to disclose £105,000
of inner reserves, which had been
accumulated against drought and other
contingencies. Since reserves are now
heaped £47,251 in excess of paid capital,
the two combined need net only 4.3 p.c.
to show 9 p.c, on capital alone. Last
term’s profit was 9.2 p.c. on shareholders’
funds.
Excepting areas north of the tropic,
pastoral conditions in both N, S. Wales
and Queensland were fair to good last
season. However, owing to drought in
the previous one, the co. put under the
hammer 6211 fewer bales wool and
64,359 fewer sheep, but sold 1591 more
cattle:

Australia’s wool cheque for the season
was the biggest ever —£ 155-odd million
(up £63-odd million), the overall average
per pound being 39.97 d., or 59 p.c. above
the previous year’s average and three
times the average for the five years to
end June, 1939.
As for the current term, good winter
rains have brightened the pastoral out-
look in N. S. Wales and in Queensland
south of the tropic. North of Capricorn
drought and all the troubles that go with
it continue. Early wools offered at
auction have been generally more attrac-
tive than those that came forward at the
same time last' season, and competition
has been keen, especially from Yorkshire
and the Continent, with welcome support
from U.S. buyers. Opening prices were
up about 5 p.c., but bids have since eased
to around the previous year’s levels. The
immediate outlook for all sound Merino
and fine crossbred wools is one of strong
demand, which augurs well for mainten-
ance of satisfactory prices, for a while
at any rate. Thus far the world
shortage of textiles has been so great
that there has been little competi-
tion between woollen, rayon and cotton
manufacturers. But in time it is certain
to be resumed. Meanwhile, the statistical
position of the staple continues to im-
prove. Total wool stocks held by J.O.
have come down from 10,407,000 bales
at mid-1945 to about 3,200,000 bales at
end June last, an achievement at one time
thought impossible before the 1950’s were
well into their stride.
The co.’s financial position further im-
proved: —

The growth of £389,738 in advances and
of £169,280 in the more-or-less liquid
surplus (£904,155) was due partly to dis-
closure of inner reserves. Outside liabili-
ties (up £442,007) include amounts held
in trust or on deposit for clients.

In 1940 this 22-year-old towelling, terry-
cloth and surgical-gauze manufacturer
made additions to its spinning and weav-
ing equipment costing approximately
£lOO,OOO, and gathered £75,000 of new
capital, which brought with it £6250 of
share premiums, for the purpose. Still,
owing to shortage of suitable labor, the
bigger plant has been unable to work at
more than about 75 p.c. capacity, thus
depriving the co. of the full benefits of
a large and expanding local market, in
which war and post-war conditions have
severely restricted competition from over-
seas.
For these and other reasons, including
official control of both buying and selling
prices, subsidies and mounting costs, net
earnings have remained on a fairly even
keel over the last seven years, and the
ords. have had a steady 8 p.c. with
moderate margins. Until production is
substantially stepped-up “it is imprac-
ticable to increase profits to a level com-
mensurate with the net worth of share-
holders’ funds,” the chairman says. To
help solve the problem the board has em-
barked upon a home-building programme
with a view to sponsorship of skilled
labor from Britain,
Although recurrent wage-lifts and the
40-hour week bumped up costs last term,
net profit was written at £17,454 (up
£297). That covered the pref. div. (£2400)
and 10 p.c. on the £150,000 of ord. capital
as against 9.8, 8.5, 10.1, 9.4, 10.1 and
11.1 p.c. back to 1942, The allowance
for depreciation was £15,270 (down £88)
and for taxation £16,800 (up £150). An
overprovision of £lO7l for War-time (Co.)
Tax in the previous term and £2294 re-
covered in respect of wage subsidies for
1946 and 1947 were sent direct to reserves,
now £20,591, after deducting goodwill
(£27,000), not treated as an asset herein.
The allowance for depreciation, how-
ever, gives the book-value of tangible
support for capital a different complexion,
and ought to enhance the co.’s competi-
tive power when the present sellers’
market is no more. At current rates of
depreciation the book-value of plant in
the weaving mill will be entirely written
off inside three years and in the spinning
mill within five years. It is a sound policy
which, speaking generally, has yielded
good results to shareholders in the past,
and should do so in the future, though
inflation and taxation are restraining in-
fluences.
The co.’s finances are comfortable:

ances for depreciation, etc., enabled the

snip £4142 off the amount coming to
sundry creditors. The more-or-less liquid
surplus (£108,867) was £20,173 stronger;

Encouraged by rising returns from
the parent co.’s finance activities and
from its expanding subsidiary interests in
home-furnishing, the board is taking steps
to raise more capital. Last term’s par
issue of £22,396 having brought the paid
figure to within £7323 of the £236,105
authorised capital, the latter is now being
raised to £500,000. Details of the new
issue haven’t been announced.
Consolidated Finance Corporation is
the reconstructed Producers and General
Finance Corp., Ltd., whose new board
had to adopt a drastic rehabilitation pro-
gramme In 1938 after the havoc wrought
in the co.’s first two years of life. Cul-
mination of this retrenchment scheme was
the lopping-away of £388,750 capital in
1945 by writing down the face-value of
the ords, from £1 to 4s. each ; pref.
holders agreed to forgo their dividend
arrears and to exchange each 7 p.c. cumu-
lative £1 share for a similar pref. of 16s.
plus one 4s, ord.
An earlier stage of the retrenchment
had entailed the jettisoning of sub-
sidiary activities, including furniture in-
terests, but since 1945 C.F.C. has made
a marked return to this field. Its four
subsidiaries now comprise two Sydney
furniture retailers (A. W. Booth Pty. and
Kellys Furniture Pty,), one removaUst co.
(Kilners Pty.), and a manufacturer (Lily-
field Furniture Co. Pty.). The latter was
acquired during last term and showed “a
small loss” to June 30, which the board
doesn’t expect to be repeated; all the
other subsidiaries “recorded satisfactory
profits.”
Latest balance-sheet figures indicate a
sharp increase last term in C.F.C.’s own
business of hire-purchase and genera!
financing. The £62,541 rise in advances
shown in consolidated figures was
entirely the result of the parent’s in-
creased loans; this item, which appears

SUNDRY SHOWS
DUCHESS OF MALFI.
Cavalier Productions put on
a skilfully-cut version (by
Barbara Jefferis) of John
Webster’s “The Duchess of
Malfi” at the Independent,
North Sydney. Since cuts
were deemed necessary, it is
not surprising that much of
the rich but minor material
has gone. But the central
theme of the tragedy of the
young widowed duchess, her
passion for her steward Antonio,
their secret marriage, flight and
the revenge and subsequent de-
struction of her brothers Ferdi-
nand and the Cardinal, is clearly
and sharply presented, as, are the
characters of all the central
figures and that of the brothers’
tool, Bosola —a double-edged
tool who, on being refused his
fee for the strangling of the
Duchess and her children, kills
off the brothers in a final scene
which, for bloodiness, rivals “A
Spanish Tragedy.”
Despite the general blood-
shed, and a general Eliza-
bethan luxuriousness which leads
to excess in all directions, there is
much within the play that has
the timeless quality of tragedy,
and this quality was best ex-
pressed by June Cornell as the
Duchess after she had become a
fugitive.
Earlier, in the courting scenes,
she had appeared a shade too
arch for a great lady forced by
her position to play the suitor to
her steward. The comment of
her maid, Cariola,
Whether the spirit of greatness or of
woman
Reign most in her, I know not; but
it shows
A fearful madness
had only an imperfect applica-
tion. Her madness was less like
the splendid folly of a queen
than the silliness of a serving
wench, and one was more in-
clined to sympathise with the in-
dignation of her brothers than
with the doomed lovers.
In the flight scene, however,
June Cornell took the part of a
great lady, hunted, beggared,
bitter and in love clear-sighted
enough to recognise the fate that
hung over them, powerless to
fight it and yet resenting it
proudly with all her passionate
being. This high note, with a
few minor lapses, she sustained
throughout the part.
John Craig, as Antonio, was a
shade too fearful. Helplessness
and fear were in the character,
but Webster’s Antonio was a
man of his hands, base-born, but
with a certain high courage—a
“proper man.” Craig’s* Antonio
was more like a schoolboy who
had been discovered raiding the
headmaster’s pantry. David
Magoffin, as Duke Ferdinand,
the Duchess’s brother, was both
good and bad. He made a
splendid, turbulent, swashbuck-
ling aristocrat, corrupted by
pride and ambition, and, in the
splendid, brief,
Cover her face; mine eyes dazzle:
she died young.
he gives the words full dramatic
content. But, immediately after-
wards, when he flies from the
body of his murdered sister and,
earlier, when he rants upon the
discovery of the birth of a child
there is too much exaggeration—
a kind of hysterical histrionics.
But Magoffin and John Kings-
mill, as the Cardinal, and, in-
deed, all the leading characters
had clear and precise diction —
without any great dramatic em-
phasis Webster’s words, at their
best, conveyed the tragedy.
Bosola, as played by Gordon
Rudd, mumbled into his beard
too much. It was a fine and
robust beard, suitable for a san-
guinary soldier of fortune, and
Rudd made a suitably vigorous
figure. But there is more to the
character than violence—conflict
and temptation are more clearly
shown in Bosola than in any
other figure, and some of the
most telling passages of self-
analysis were lost, as it were, in
whiskers.
"The Circle."
Turn Pendleton’s “Bah! ” in the
Kuringai Theatre Guild’s presen-
tation of Maugham’s “The
Circle” at Kijlara Hall is a won-
derful ejaculation. Pendleton is
Lord Porteous, who, as a young
man, dashed his Parliamentary
career and Ministerial promise
by running off with Lady
Catherine Champion - Chaney
(Eleanor Marina), who, for her
part, gave up a comfortable
home, social standing and respec-
tability to go off with him.
Thirty years later on a visit to
England they meet Lady
Catherine’s husband, Clive
Champion - Chaney (O. D.
Bisset), her son (W ins t o n
Hunter), a priggish young M.P.,
and his wife (Beth Vincent), who
is trying to decide whether or not
to.run off with a young planter
to Malaya.
Thirty years have brought Lady
Catherine to fat, overdressed and
overpainted loquacity and Por-
teous to plump, tired and almost
silent cynicism. His exclamation
comes when Bisset, rubbing in
their discomfort and disillusion
with suave, ruthless precision,
says “You don’t mind if I kiss
my wife, do you?” and with the
one explosive “Bah!” Pendleton
not only* implies “Don’t be a
bloody fool” and “What the
hell do I care,” but expresses the
whole 30 years dt disillusion.
Both Bisset and Pendleton
turn in excellent performances.
Bisset maintains his subtle,
amusing irritation tactics with
a gentle, inconspicuous insist-
ence that gradually dispels the
initial sympathy for a wronged
and rather charming husband,
and explains both his wife’s
clearing-out and his son. Pen-
dleton provides a similar revela-
tion by changing, under Bisset’s
inhuman tactics, from tired
boredom to human and slightly
courageous activity. Eleanor
Marina says all there is to say as
Lady Catherine, but she says it a
little too loudly for Maugham,
particularly beside the polished
sureness of Bisset and Pendleton.
The younger generation is
handled well enough, if not as
well. Beth Vincent makes a
beautiful, dissatisfied wife, but
to be completely feasible the
character needs more strength
than she gives it. In the early
scenes Arnold Hunter is too
cold, even for the block of ice
he is supposed to represent;
later he thaws a little to some
degree of credibility. At least
he makes the husband a figure
from whom any wife would
want to bolt, and thereby con-
siderably aids James Workman
in making a credible figure of
the planter from Malaya.
Workman also produced the
show, and it is a topnotch job; —
despite any minor inadequacies
in the acting, and despite the fact
that Bisset and Pendleton are a
long way ahead of the rest of the
cast, it runs as smoothly and de-
lightfully as a Maugham comedy
should, the only serious inter-
ruptions being some prolonged
bursts of laughter from the audi-
ence.
Formula for Landscape
Watercolors by Enid Cam-
bridge at Sydney Macquarie
Galleries are not so much a reve-
lation of Nature as the applica-
tion of a formula to it.
The paintings show no ad-
vance in technique from work
Miss Cambridge has previously
exhibited, and —though the sub-
jects must surely be different —
one has the impression that the
same landscapes are being shown
for the second, the third or the
tenth time: the inevitable result
when paint matters more than
subject to the artist, when style
is substituted for vision.
The formula, apart from its
fundamental abstraction, has
certain disadvantages: there is a
Iqoseness of form (is there a
creek in the picture bought for
the X S. Wales National Gal-
lery or are the boys with nets
hunting butterflies?); there are
too many harsh black pencil
lines showing among the trees
(this is not an art which con-
ceals art); and all hills in all
weather, presumably under the
influence of Cdzanne, are masses
of blotchy purple.
But the work, on the whole,
is by no means unattractive.
The colors are rich and decora-
tive, and earth and trees and
skies are caught up in sweeping
rhythms. Perhaps chiefly be-
cause the formula looks different
when it is located inside a room,
but also because of their har-
monious colors, the paintings
which linger most pleasantly in
the memory are two interiors,
one in warm red and gold and
the other, showing flowers
against a harbor background, in

Hephzibah Menuhin was the
soloist in the final Sydney Town
Hall concert of Paul Klecki,
Beethoven’s Fifth Concerto
(“The Emperor”) being the
work. There was nothing
greatly spectacular about the
performance. It was good,
solid playing throughout, the
set of quasi-variations compris-
ing the second movement find-
ing the orchestra in particularly
good fettle. The various dia-
logues between piano and
orchestra were never allowed by
Miss Menuhin to degenerate
into mere ragged debate —the
keyboard’s voice had authority,
even some imperiousness, with
an admirable clarity in both
hands. Paul Klecki drove the
orchestra with a strong hand.
He works harder over a score,
which he automatically turns
over at the end of each move-
ment but never looks at, than
any conductor seen here in years.

YOUR SHOUT!
AND IT'S
RED MILL RUM.
There was an attendance of 71,600
at Randwick on Saturday, with every
individual painfully aware of the
presence of the other 71,599; Rand-
wick is simply unable to comfortably
accommodate the crowds attracted to
major meetings these days.
The Derby was a thriller from the
word go. None of the all-too-fre-
quently-seen mile canter with a half-
mile sprint at the finish; they were
at it hammer and tongs from the
start. However, it was the 66-to-l
chance Foxzami who got to the front,
tried to lead all the way and failed
only by margins of a nose and a neck.
Well ridden by the Derby-expert, D.
Munro, Vagabond drew past Foxzami
inside the distance, momentarily had
the Blue Ribbon in his grasp only
to see it snatched away by Carbon
Copy. Seeing no hope of obtaining
his beloved run along the rails,
Breasley had taken Carbon Copy to
the outside at the turn and the Helios
colt finished magnificently down the
centre of the track—so wide out in
fact as to mislead the judge’s thou-
sands of unofficial “assistants,” most
of whom thought that Vagabond had
won.
The excellent Derby performances
of Vagabond and Foxzami, both New
Zealand bred, were rather in contrast
with their previous public form.
Vagabond, who was heavily backed,
had turned in some fairly promising
efforts, but has yet to win a race. A
comparative failure in lesser company,
Foxzami particularly surprised with
his front-running performance. Be-
hind the placegetters, Comic Court,
Snowstream, Royal Andrew, Bold
Duke and Bernbrook finished pretty
much in a bunch. Beating only two
home, Ungar was the complete dis-
appointment of the race.
Trained by D. S. McCormick for
Messrs. A. G. Silk and “H. J. Ascot,”
Carbon Copy is bred to stay. His
sire Helios, son of the English Derby-
winner Hyperion, produced a V.R.C.
Derby-winner (Beau Gem) and an
AJ.C. St. Leger-winner (Cronides) in
his first season at stud. Carbon
Copy’s dam, Havers, is a half-sister
to Gay Lad (AJ.C. St. Leger) and
her pedigree is studded with the names
of good stayers. Carbon Copy gets
his name from his close resemblance
to Hyperion.
Nat Gould, and a host of other
writers before and since, have realised
the fictional possibilities of the un-
known horse from the bush coming
down to win the big race at head-
quarters. Lending a touch of truth
to the oft-told tale, the Epsom went
to the little mare from New England,
De La Salle, of which, till a few
months back, not one in a hundred
Sydney racegoers had ever heard.
Although only one of her four
Sydney wins had been against open
company, and despite that only two
mares had won the Epsom in the
previous 50 years (one of them win-
ning on a protest), De La Salle started
7-to-2 favorite for the Epsom and
won gamely, if narrowly, from
Filipino and Slander. It was another
grand finish with Sir Raven and
Plausible also well in the picture, and
Titanic finishing fast behind them.
De La Salle’s rider, J. Thompson,
must have been a worried lad with
three furlongs to go, for at that stage
he was in a thoroughly unpromising
position, but a fine horseman on a
game and good horse takes a lot of
holding down.
A four-year-old by Speardale-
Fossil, De La Salle is trained by
D. L. Burke for V. J. Byrnes. Just
12 months ago she won her first race
—a Maiden Handicap at Manilla
(N.S.W.) worth £lO.
Barrier trials and the like having
pointed to nothing in particular as
outstanding among the baby two-year-
olds, the Breeders’ Plate was an un-
usually open affair, but, as frequently
happens, it was won from go to whoa
in easy fashion*. The High Caste-
Ghippia colt, High Jip, made all the
running to win by four lengths from
Count Bourbon and Aqua Regis and
gave jockey G. Podmore a win on
his first day back in the saddle since
being disqualified over the Huamight
business.
. • 4 • •
With the Epsom favorite home and
hosed, the bookies’ cup of grief fair
overflowed when De La Salle’s stable-
mate and hot favorite for the Metrop.,
Dark Marne, made absolute hacks of
Yamboon, Columnist, Courier, Proc-
tor and Silver Link in the w.f.a.
Colin Stephen Stakes of 12 furlongs.
Excuses were again made for
Columnist; “he met with interference
at the half-mile.’'’ It must have been
quite some interference; Columnist
finished a good 10 lengths behind
Dark Marne.
* ♦ ♦ ♦
Melbourne racegoers had a double
issue last week with meetings at Caul-
field (Thursday) and Flemington
(Saturday). The most notable effort
seen at Caulfield was that of Royal
Gem winning the Underwood Stakes
from Gay Saint and Hororata, in
doing which he equalled his own
course record of 1.364 for the m^e >
brought his stake-winnings to £27,480,
and his Caulfield record to seven
wins and a deadbeat from 11 starts
on that track.
Attendance on Saturday seemed be-
low average for Flemington, but those
present had a splendid day; favorites
won the first four events, and second-
favorites the next two on a card of
seven races.
One hot favorite well and truly
upset was Lungi in the Turnbull
Stakes of 12 furlongs. The race was
won by Beau Gem, and the riders
of the other five runners should be
“There'll be no arguments about the score now.”
hanging their heads yet. Shooting
Beau Gem to the, front as they left
the straight, R. Heather went for a
big lead and none of the others made
any attempt at pursuit till it was far
too late. Lungi, three lengths be-
hind the winner, finished too well for
the rest, headed by Anthelion.
The Maribyrnong Trial Stakes for
fillies, the first two-year-old race of
the season, went to Luck Penny,
which is not, as one might think, a
misprint. A daughter of Dhoti-Star
Valley, Luck Penny was ridden by
Purtell and started favorite. Favorite
also, with W. Williamson in the
saddle, was the Caithness gelding
Tartan Crest, who downed Birdman
and Hunch in the Maribyrnong for
colts and geldings.
Making up some half-dozen lengths
with a slashing run in the straight,
the Double Remove colt Sun Blast
(W. A. Smith) just got up to pip
Bartonge in the 10-furlongs October
Handicap for three-year-old colts and
geldings. Sun Blast had been slightly
preferred in the betting to Rocket
Gun, who finished third. Likely
candidates for the Oaks contested the
Edward Manifold Stakes, in which
Siren Song (E. Clarke) scored a well-
timed victory over Lady Luba and
Parlez Vous. The Manifold was
marred by a nasty smash in which
five horses came down, one was de-
stroyed, and three riders injured.
Having won at Caulfield on Thurs-
day, Sir Nolle (R. Dean) was a
natural favorite for the Bourke Hurdle
and again did the trick.
Being either devils for punishment
or else anxious to help the bookies
save something from the wreck,
punters made Lucky Robin, in the
face of his last-start failure, hot
favorite for the Stand Handicap.
Lucky Robin merely repeated his pre-
vious effort and the race went to the
10-to-l chance Royal Scot (N.
Powell) with Bold John and Black
Beau in the places.
♦ * * *
Starting off the rain-spoilt second
day of the AJ.C. Spring Meeting at
Randwick on Monday, the Gimcrack
Stakes, for the present pick of the
two-year-old fillies, was won nicely by
Rhumba (E. Fordyce), with Favour
second, Pantomime (she got away
badly) third, and Tivoli Star a close
foilrth. Course-scratching of Temer-
aire took a lot of interest out of the
Shorts, in which the South Australian
Comedy Prince got there very easily.
Despite rain-effects, Comedy Prince
lumped equal top weight, 8.12, and
that good mare Shading won the Kia-
Ora Handicap with the burden of
9.9, giving Nell Gwynne (second)
nearly 2st. But a further heavy down-
pour was the bit extra too much for
topweight Dark Marne in the Metro-
politan, the lightly-weighted Buonar-
otti Boy coming, as almost always
happens in the big doubles, to the
rescue of the books; Karachi second,
then Kerry Lad.

The Ferrier-Pickworth golf match
at The Lakes (Sydney) was a startling
affair of eagles to win and birdies to
halve. Ferrier was five down at the
37th starting the second day, caught
and passed Pickworth, who squared
it at the 72nd and won it at the 73 rd.
They’re to meet again, in Melbourne.

Out of condition after a six-weeks
let-up from training, Olympic rep.
M. Curotta was twice beaten in the
Schoolboys’ Athletic Championships
at Sydney Cricket Ground. R.
Estella, of Sydney Grammar, downed
Curotta in a comparatively slow-run
100yds. (10.45ec.), and G. Gedge
(Sydney Tech. College) downed the
Olympic lad at his pet distance of
440yds. Gedge clocked the fairifh
time 0f,50.55ec. for the quarter-mile
and also added three inches to the
long-jump record with a leap of 22ft.

If the power of observation figures
among its faculties, the N.S.W.
Cricket Association should have
learned something from the opening
round of Sydney’s premiership cricket,
restricted by rain to one day’s play.
Since time had to be equally divided,
dullness was left to the skies, and of
the eight matches five ended in swift
victory for the most enterprising side.
Heaviest walloping was accorded
Gordon (last yearns premiers), who
crashed before the bowling of Cum-
berland’s L. Benaud, taking seven
for 106. Other winners were Uni-
versity, Western Suburbs, St. George
and Marrickville. More one-day
matches seem to be the shot.
♦ * * *
The 80,000-odd who turned out at
M.C.G. for the V.F.L. “grand final”
will have to go again next Saturday
if they want to see the premiership
won. Essendon, 7.27, and Melbourne,
10.9, drew with 69 points each after
a ragged, fumbling game of play
anything but the ball. The spectacle
of a premiership side kicking 7.27
gave the crowd the blues when it
wasn’t yelling its disapproval. About
the only footballers on the ground
were Reynolds and McClure of Essen-
don and the Cordners and Mueller
of Melbourne. Melbourne just man-
aged to catch the Dons’ long tally
of behinds in the last 10 minutes.
Still, it’s all good for V.F.L. finances.

When Jackie Wilson and Nipper
O’Brien met at Leichhardt a few
weeks back Wilson received the de-
cision. In a return contest at the
same arena last week Wilson was
again declared winner on points, and
this time earned the decision. Scaling
9.44, Wilson walked away with the
first round; O’Brien (9.24) shone in
the following few episodes, but there-
after it was again all Wilson’s way.

Thrift and Enterprise
A higher productivity from
each Australian and greater real
thrift per head are both neces-
sary in the future to restore our
capital equipment and raise our
living standards in the terms of
consumer goods..
Run-down railways and trans-
port services, inadequate water-
conservation, insufficient coal,
lack of building materials and
homes and deteriorating high-
ways' are all the result of inade-
quate production (and man-
power scarcity). In some cases
we have not the plant capacity
to turn out more goods and re-
equip services. That is because
of inadequate capital investment
in the past—mainly the immedi-
ate past of war years and
“Labor” control. In other cases
manpower is not making best
use of the plant available. In
any case, the circumstances to-
gether are having the effect of
restricting the output of con-
sumer goods needed for present
requirements and delaying the
expansion of that part of the
nation’s production capacity
which calls for investments in
plant and machinery.
It is out of production per head
and thrift per head that we get
our industrial expansion. True,
there must be some kind of bal-
ance between the people’s ex-
penditure on consumer goods
and their investment in capital
assets for the production of
further goods. There must be
eventually*a consumer market
for all the products of expanded
industry. And in times of
financial boom, as now, con-
sumers , and industry compete
strongly for the materials and
services available, while in a
slump both consumers and in-
vestors show a reluctance or in-
ability to spend money.
It is in slump times that
Government expenditure can be
a help in re-establishing pro-
ducer and consumer relation-
ships, in seeing that essential
capital expenditure is not
neglected, or in seeing that any
unemployed labor is used on
national work that really needs
doing regardless of the public’s
hesitancy about investing.
Unless" we have thrift we never
have any public works or in-
dustrial equipment. A com-
munity that spends all it earns,
consumes all it produces never
has any surplus for the building-
up of capital assets —that is, re-
producing assets. And where
production to begin with is de-
liberately hampered by in-
dustrial lawlessness and Com-
munist sabotage the economy is
off to a particularly bad start,
Australia’s inadequate snip-
ping and other transport facili-
ties, as well as underproduction
of coal, other raw materials and
manufactures, will only be
overcome by greater efforts
from manpower and a bigger in-
vestment in the productive side
of industry. We must establish
a greater surplus of production
over and above consumer re-
quirements so that we can pro-
vide the machinery of produc-
tion for the basis of a higher
standard of living in the way of
consumer goods and housing.
Thrift has been discouraged
by “Labor” Governments for a
quarter of a century. Increased
production per man has also
been regarded with hostility by
the “Labor” movement. Though
“Labor” today urges the people
to save money in order to re-
strict inflation, it is in the spirit
of deathbed repentance, and its
urgings are contradicted by its
general policy. So are its last-
minute exhortations to produce
more.
Last year the Governments of
Australia, but chiefly the
Federal “Labor” Government,
levied £419 million of taxation
from the people—more than a
quarter of the inflated national
income. In 1938-39 taxation
totalled £139 million, and was
about 17 p.c. of the national in-
come. The increase in the
volume and proportion of the
national income that is being
taken away in taxation —and
especially from the productive
and organisational side of in-
dustry —is restricting industrial
initiative and placing spending-
power in the hands of a Govern-
ment that knows little about the
economics of production and
which, through its industrial
politics, has helped to bring the
present demoralisation of in-
dustry about.
There is a lot of misdirected
thought about money matters
and productivity of industry.
Profligate expenditure by people
and by Governments is a bad
thing. There must be national
thrift of some kind. Unless pri-
vate enterprise is permitted to
save from the Government tax-
gatherers sufficient of its earn-
ings to allow additional invest-
ment in new factories, new
marketing organisations, new
services, etc., on an adequate
scale the country will stagnate.
And if the Government chooses
to take the money of private
enterprise for “national works”
those works have to be well
planned and ably managed. As
yet we have no evidence that
Governments can replace private
enterprise in industry. But in
Australia “Labor” Governments
are always hindering private in-
dustry and always jealous and
suspicious of it.
Governments today not only
restrict private enterprise on the
financial side; they compete
with it for the reduced amount
of materials and services avail-
able. Thus is the effect of in-
adequate production made
cumulative and compounding.
Wasted manpower in Govern-
ment departments, in Com.-con-
trolled unions and in trades held
up by strikes in key industries
all add to the essential economic
problems of the present day. We
must return to a state of society
where private enterprise and
private thrift are respected as
essential co-partners in a healthy
economy, and where disobedi-
“The Utile pet's gained six wore ounces."
ence of fair and broadminded
industrial tribunals is outlawed.
We have learned a great deal
about the management of money
and the prevention of unemploy-
ment over the past 10 years. But
all this experience will be value-
less unless Labor is prepared to
do a fair day’s work for fair
pay, and unless productive enter-
prise is given full encourage-
ment urider enlightened political,
banking and economic policy.
The less waste there is of money,
materials and manpower, too,
the higher will be the general
living standard.
Though shares of the English-
controlled banks have, like the
others, scarcely reacted at all on
the local market either to the
High Court’s verdict or to
speculations about varying the
£A, the story in London has
been rather different. Sterling
quotations for the three English-
managed cos. and the ’Wales
(also quoted in Throgmorton-
street) have steadily risen during
the past six weeks. Overall, the
advance has been about 10 p.c.,
with the ’Wales doing somewhat
better than that and the E., S.
and A. rather less. A comparative
inertia here has thus resulted in
a discrepancy between the Lon-
don and Australian quotes that
has gone well beyond the usual
arbitrage-exchange points. Since
August, 1947, transfers of bank
shares between the English and
Australian registers have been
restricted as a matter of policy,
so that the discrepancy may con-
tinue for some time. Meanwhile,
an occasional local sale of some
classes of bank scrip is still end-
ing up in the hands of Govern-
ment nominees at the guaranteed
minimum price ; that wouldn’t
happen if the London prices
were effective here.
* * * *
From the address by Aus-
tralian Foundation Investment
Co.’s chairman:
Following press reports that the
Government proposed to relinquish
its war-time control of new capital
issues, the Prime Minister recently
stated that the control would be con-
tinued until the end of 1948, when the
Defence (Transitional Powers) Act,
conferring this and other special
powers, would expire. He indicated
that the question of the future of
the various controls now remaining
in the hands of the Government
would then be considered, and added
that he would not be surprised if
capital issues control were continued
after the end of December.
Actually, there has been no strong
objection on the part of investors to
official regulation of new capital issues.
At the same time, there has been
criticism of the practice of fixing high
premiums for new issues of ordinary
shares to shareholders in cases where
the prices of existing shares stand at
premiums on the Stock Exchange.
Shareholders do not benefit from
the high premiums charged, real divi-
dends being much less than the
nominal rate declared on share-capital
alone.
The possession by a company of
a large amount of free premium capi-
tal may also become an embarrass-

MAORILAND FINANCE AND INDUSTRY.
The New Pound
Maoriland’s new pound hasn’t
helped to bring wages and taxes
into balance with other costs or
hasten the day when red-tape
and rationing will be expelled
from the country. Leading
economist Prof. A. H. Tocker,
with 21 years’ high academic
authority and a fund of experi-
ence as economic adviser, dubs
wages and taxes as “major ele-
ments in present costs,” and
doesn’t hold out much hope of
sharp falls in costs under the
changed set-up in M.L. today.
His prognosis is that more
stability in consumers’ prices
will be paid for by “consider-
able instability in consumers’ in-
comes,” which boils down to
taking out of one pocket and
putting into the other while
running the risk of dropping
something in the transfer.
Tocker and others think the
Dominion missed a chance of
pepping - up the pound on
sounder lines by chopping taxes
to ease the load on the backs of
ordinary citizens and business-
men, but tax - cutting isn't
Labor’s strong point. If this
had been done and controls had
been given a body-blow at the
same time M.L. might have
found a safer way out of its
troubles. The catch is that N.Z.
Labor politicians and their
henchmen can’t, or won’t, tackle
controls, at least not until they
see how Australia comes out of
the swim. If, however, the
Commonwealth paddles into
smoother waters and M.L.
would like to follow, it will have
its New Look pound to reckon
with.
There was too much money in
N.Z. for the goods to be bought
before the big currency move ;
now, with the pound worth 20
p.c. more, the balance is tipped
further in the wrong direction.
This won’t make it easier to end
import-control. Somehow New
Zealand must get money down
and goods up, for it needs more
cake to go round. But it dare
not throw the door wide open
for imports. A pretty fix, and
odds are that import-rationing
will be the big headache for
some time yet.
Bank of New Zealand
Profit of the State-owned
Bank of New Zealand has
slipped back to £429,796, a drop
of £5454, in the second full yea?
(ended March) since the 8600
shareholders were bought out at
a cost of £9,140,000. Ord. div N ,
paid to M.L.’s Treasury, is
steady at 7 p.c. Gross earnings
jumped to a new peak of slightly
over £2i million, but soaring
exes, more than swallowed up
the gain of £136,000, Activity
was hectic when last summer’s
flood of imports swelled traders’
stocks and forced firms to lean
heavily on the banks. Cos. are
still grappling with problems of
unloading surpluses, with the
added spur now of a secret
“deadline date” ahead, when the
Government will declare new
price-levels based on the new
sterling parity.
Against bankers’ efforts to
curb borrowing Bank of N.Z.
advances mounted to £4O mil-
lion, £B£ million above the 1947
figure. This, bankers proudly
claim, is evidence that they’re
not being tough with traders but
are showing plenty of latitude.
Loans for merchandise get
favored treatment because
they’re short-term. There is a
battle against inflation going on
in Maoriland, with the Govern-
ment and the Reserve Bank
holding the rein on bank credit
and turning many borrowers
away to seek funds in other
channels. This includes share-
issues and property-purchases or
mortgage - repayments. Still-
buoyant payments for exports
are reckoned to keep purses
filled while banks struggle to get
money under tighter control.
Cement Shortage
Cement production in Maori-
land is sick, under
the slimming influence of indus-
trial bottlenecks. While builders,
contractors and the Government
cry out for more, cement output
falls lower each year, but
the State has first call on
supplies, so it’s mainly private
users who go short. Coal is the
biggest trouble, as cement-works
and gas cos. compete for ship-
ments that leave both scratching.
Last year chairman George
Winstone, of Wilsons (N.Z.)
Cement, Ltd., Auckland, said
output had shrunk at the rate of
a thousand tons a month —that
was 12,000 for the year —and
there’s no sign yet of anything
better.
Gold cos. in Maoriland are
far from happy about changes
that have come their way in the
past couple of months. Instead
of cheering when the gold-
export tax of 12s. 6d. an ounce
was given the k.o. in August
they groaned as M.L.’s new
pound brought down the price
of the yellow metal from
£lO 15s. to £8 12s. 3d. an ounce.
Among the hardest hit was
M.L.’s oldest and most famous
mine, worked by the Martha
Gold Co. at Waihi. It’s nearly
70 years since men started to
dig the hole where they’ve found
bullion (gold and silver) worth
more than £25 million, and
there’si a lot more still down
there, but it’s low-grade now.
J. H. G. Banks, N.Z. director
for Martha, which has its board
in London, doesn’t like the out-
look for a mine that’s on the
borderline or just beyond it. He
wouldn’t like to- see the old
mine die, because there’s plenty
of wealth that should be worth
getting—at a cost —but that’s
the rub. Costs, already a big
headache before exchange ad-
justment knocked gold-produc-
ing off its balance, are
threatened with another big
jump when the working week isi
cut to 35 hours on January 1
next, against 40 hours now.
Output will fall 12£ per cent.,
say Martha executives. Silver
gets it in the neck as well as
gold, for the price has dropped
from ss. sd. to 4s, 4d. per oz.
Martha losses are put at £2OO a
day since the jump in the
pound, and even Labor bigwigs
must see that this can’t go on
long. For Waihi closing of the
mine would be nearly a mortal
blow; the town’s heart would
almost cease to beat.


ABORIGINALITIES
“Old-timer”: Far be it for me to in-
trude with anything having the slightest
smell of politics about it, but I can’t help
wondering whether the country isn’t suf-
fering a little from this “full employ-
ment.” There was a time when the
squatter, the wheatgrower, the struggling
cocky or the contractor who wanted a
few days’ help could make for the
nearest town, bridge or riverside camp
and there pick up a man. But where are
they now, the men and boys who jumped
the rattlers, battled the towns, cadged
handouts on the track, camped under the
bridges and bore northward in winter
and southward in summer? Well, I ran
into a couple of bushwhackers in Sydney
the other day, heading for a shearing-
shed beyond Warialda. They bad their
gear packed and were waiting for a bus
to take them to an airport to the plane
that was to fly them west over plains and
rivers they had footed it by in other days.
The nomads, it seems, are no more, and
outback their absence is felt, for who is
to do the country’s odd jobs now?
jfg *j{ 5J5 jj*
“Wippegong”: The two best-known
robins, the flame and the scarlet, are
mostly birds of the mountains. When
the frosts are heaviest you’ll find them
out on the flats, but as soon as the
weather warms again they’re back where
“Keep still; you’ll unsettle the whole swarm!”
the nights are cool. With them there is
the sprite of the family, the tiny red-
capped fellow ; but, scorning the restricted
habitat of his slightly larger cousins, he
wanders also right to the back o’ Bourke.
He’s feeding chicks there now ; a con-
tinuous soft cheeping in the wilgas tells
where a couple of brown-and-white
fledglings are trailing along behind Mum,
while the dapper little cock, head on one
side, studies the ground amongst the
budda and bimble-box, the supplejack
and beefwood and cypress, gobbling his
fill but contributing also to the filling of
the chicks. That’s on the red sand; but
where the soil turns rocky and reaches
an elevation of fully 4ft, on a “ridge”
about half a mile wide and covered with
mulga, like great grey-green mushrooms
on a lawn of yellow goodenia, there’s a
soft, haunting note repeated so often that
the infectious urgency of it leads you on
till you find it, coming from a throat
blacker than even the oldest mulga trunk.
This is the male hooded robin, and if you
become one with the motionless trees he
might let you find his beautifully woven
cup, with its dark green eggs, wedged
into the rough bark where a branch is
wrenched or broken; approach it and
you’ll see one of the best versions of
the “broken-wing” act. Though more
sombre in hue than his kin, he is perhaps
the most vigilant; but he is ■ the true
migrant of the family, and suffers the
restless disorders common to those with
chronic itchy feet

“Bo”: “Lousiest cove I ever worked
for,” said Stepper Stephens, “was a cow-
cocky up on the northern rivers. One
mornin’ he tells me to go an’ pick up
a coupla bags o’ wheat at the sidin’. As
I'm shovin’ some juice in the utility he
comes over carryin’ a big wire cage with
four chooks in it an’ pokes it in the back
o’ the truck. ‘Want me to sell ’em?’ I
ask him. The cocky stares at me as if
I’d gone batty. ‘’Course not!’ he said.
‘There’s always a bit o’ seed you’ll find
spilled around a railway sidin’. While
y’re loadin’ up them hens might as well
be havin’ a feed of it’! ”
* * * *
“Salmon Gums”: Big rabbit-burrows
(B. 15/9/’48)? I’ve seen some in the
Westralian wheatbelt that measured over
a quarter of an acre, while many a
“colony” must run to the acre —easily.
Bulldozing them out seems a practical
way of handling the job, but it wouldn’t
carry half the fun Bill the Goose and I
got out of it. Took on a job fumigating
for a cocky once. We used sulphur-
dioxide, the idea being for one of us to
pumb the stuff into one burrow while
the other sniffed at the other burrows to
find out which ones connected —then fill
them in. It was uninteresting work until
we discovered that the stuff was inflam-
mable. Thereafter we pumped the
burrows full and threw a lighted match
down one entrance. The explosion
rocked the burrow and must have played
hell with the bunnies. That was before
the Goose took up rabbiting. Now if he
saw you approach a burrow with fumi-
gant he’d report what was left of you to
the R.S.P.C.A,
* * * *
“Aperist”: I sold the four “tame”
hives kept in the back garden for queen-
rearing. By an accident a couple of
hundred bees got left behind. To com-
fort them a little I placed an empty hive
where the four hives had stood. In this,
sinking all previous internecine warfare
in the face of common disaster, the
orphans gathered. And how different
their attitude .towards me! Previously I
could sit in front of the hives with hom-
ing bees cannoning off my cheeks and
never a sting. But now these desolated
insects literally chased me out of the
garden; only by wearing a veil could I
go near the hive-box. Obviously they
blamed me, the human they had previ-
ously trusted, for what had happened.

“Shavia”; Residents of isolated Kin-
goonya on S.A.’s east-west line are sus-
pected of adopting union tactics in a
request to the P.M.G. The union idea is,
when submitting a claim, to double the
amount sought and then grudgingly to
accept half. Kingoonyaites, wanting their
only public telephone enclosed to give
some slight measure of privacy, therefore
lodged a claim for a phone-box. The
department didn’t consider a whole
cubicle necessary, but promised instead
to “enclose the instrument with a
Residents are planning now to ask for
a new post-office in the hope of getting
a new telephone-book.

“Betcha”: You lose, “Murihiku” (B.
15/9/’4B). Mine’s a beer. Betcha if I had
“Those are fightin Words!”
all the money I’ve lost in cattle “in
Southland bush in a bad season” I could
shout the whole Council under the bar.
Firstly, do you think for a moment a
beast is so dumb it can’t tell the differ-
ence between the crack of a falling tree
and the chop of an axe? In a bad season
that recipe of grabbing an axe and falling
the nearest tree to feed cattle is too good
to be true ; and the idea that “in some
bush districts it’s the only satisfying meal
the poor beasts ever get” makes me bawl
for a refill. Sheoak is one of the Sbuth-
land’s best native fodder-trees. I’ve seen-
a bullock-team filled up nightly on
lopped sheoak before being topped off
with a small ration of short-supply
tucker. They worked all right on it, too.
But when it’s wanted there’s never
enough sheoak. The kurrajong is even
less abundant, and in my experience
somewhat overrated as fodder, while
wattlf scrub —especially black-wattle —is
trimmed off in bad times, but serves only
to fill up as roughage. Have listened to
a claim that cattle will live through a
bad winter on grey-box leaves. They
will; but only if they are not allowed to
get too poor in the first place and can
get a smattering of something better to
go with it. Box-hay is more acceptable
in the sucker stage, though starvers will
mop up any of it in a drought. But gum,
stringy, peppermint, apple-box, etc, —no,
sir.
♦ • ♦ ♦ *
“Yolande”: I know something better
than “Murihiku’s” axe (B. 15/9/’4B) to
attract cattle. In the early days of the
war, when cockies were rushing in with
claims on the Army for compensation
for damages, one, a Collins-sfreet
farmer who had bought a lot of cows as
a spec., put in a fabulous claim -on the
ground that the noise of firing had
scared his cows and interfered with their
condition. The board of inquiry had as
its civilian expert adviser the manager of
a large dairying estate. He emphatically
assorted that, so far from rifle (even
machine-gun) shots scaring cows, it has
the opposite effect: to such an extent
that men had to be detailed to keep the
cows away from the range while firing
was in progress. Compensation refused*
“G’roper”: Before “L, TopsTs” ex-
position (B. 8/9/’4B) I stand reproved.
Since “L.T.” is able to take that motley
collection of runaway convicts and dead-
beat sealers —well, certainly, from a legal
viewpoint they were pirates ; anyone who
steals a rowboat is a pirate. Still, it
reminds me of an apt remark credited
to the late Edward Kelly. When Ned’s
gang were making big headlines quite a
number of other “bushrangers” appeared
on the roads, many of their misdeeds, be-
ing blamed on to the Kellys. Asked for
an opinion regarding these rivals Ned
snorted; “Bushrangers? Tea-and-sugar
bushrangers! ”
« * * «
“Mat’s Mate”: “Funniest fight I ever
see,” said Mat, “was in Forbes one time.
It was pretty dry an’ all the townspeople
and the cockies round about was howlin’
for rain. I’m down from up Trangie way
with a few quid in me kick, sort o’ lookin’
for a job but not goin’t’ lose any sleep
if anyone else finds it first. Anyhow, it’s
so dry it don’t look like me getting
a job, an’ I’m in the bar o’ Flannery’s
pub one day talkin’ to a old bloke who
has a bit of a place down the river, near
Red Bend. He’s complainin’ about how
dry it is when in comes a long bloke
with a big grin an’ says, ‘G’day, Hubert,
heard the news?’ ‘No,’ says Hubert.
‘Just had a ring from home. They’ve
had half an inch o’ rain,’ says the long
bloke. He leans on the bar an’ grins
to himself, an’ Hubert goes inter the
parlor an’ I hear him talkin’ on the phone
t’ somebody. He comes back lookin’
black an’ says, ‘You always was a lucky
so-and-so.’ He picks up his beer an’ the
long bloke gives a bit of a chuckle, an’
Hubert chucks his beer at him an’ they
get stuck into it. Blimey, they’d ’a’ tore
each other t’ pieces if we hadn’t prised
’em apart: I hangs on t’ Hubert while
the crowd chucks the long bloke out,
then I let him go an’ he got his hat an’
went. ‘Strike me,’ I says t’ Jack Flan-
nery. ‘Fancy gettin’ narked ’cos another
bloke got a drop o’ rain! ’ ‘They’re nex’-
door neighbors,’ he says. ‘Have bin since
they was boys. Last fight they had was
a month ago, over Hubert winnin’ a
clock in a raffle. Lanky never even had
a ticket. That’ll tell y’!’ ‘That’ll do
me,’ I says. ‘l’m headin’ for Condobolin.
They got -more sense over there.’ An’
that’s how I come t’ be workin’ at Euglo
when y’ wrote t’ me.”

“R.K.D.”; Knowing as we did the
years Fred Chappie had spent in the far
west somewhere back of Quilpie (Q.),
there were gusts of incredulous guffaws
when he announced he had bought an
oyster-farm on the Nerang River and was
settling down to live near Southport. But
Fred was serious' and very absorbed in
the oyster business, “You’d be sur-
prised,” he said, “what I don’t know
about oysters. I’m having a bit of trouble
with a mob of weaners just now. Don’t
quite know what to do with them.” He
declined an invitation for next day be-
cause he had to go somewhere and cut a
load of spruce posts. “What for?” we
asked. “Well,” said Fred, “at mustering-
time I’ll need some sort of fencing, won’t
I? Up to date I haven’t even got a calf-,
paddock.” The wife said, “I had no idea
oysters moved about so much. How on
earth will you be able to tell yours
from other oysters?” This led to
academic discussion and a couple more
rums, with Fred frowning heavily
over the problem of branding-yards and
drafting-pens for his oysters. Ear-mark-
ing, we decided, was out on account of
the difficulty of locating an oyster’s ears.
The wife sought to console Fred and be
comforting. “At least,” she said, “you’ll
have no trouble with dipping, will you?”
Fred said, “No. It works the other way
with oysters. You have to bring them up
for air now and again.” He turned a
weather-beaten poker-face on the would-
b'e comforter and went on; “But that
will be done automatically on my farm.
Twice a day the water-level subsides far
enough to uncover the oysters and give
them air, then rises again to cover them.
All done with mirrors. Wonderful thing,
mechanisation.” He drank some more
rum. The wife luffed and tacked away,
“I’d love some nice fresh oysters,” she
said wistfully. “When can we have some,
Fred?” “Not for a while,” the new
bivalve-cocky answered. “That’s the
trouble just now. The beeves are not
ready yet on account of the drought.
Wait till we get some rain and I can
fatten them. Have some rum?”
A DROVER.
A wall-eyed dog and a piebald pony,
A roll of swag on the saddlebow —
That was the outfit of Maloney
When he went droving years ago.
Many a stormy nightfall found him
Crouched by his fire with a roof of cloud;
Many a day the heat beat round him
And fine dust fell on his shoulders bowed.
But stockmen found he never faltered
Though the long, long paddock was seldom
g00d...
No time at all and his turnout altered —•
A two-horse van with a canvas hood,
Peg and lead dogs, a concertina,
Camping-gear and a cyclone roll —
On the rambling roads of Riverina
His home was the sundown waterhole.
He prospered and wed. His wife died giving
A son to the drover away with sheep.
He vowed for the boy a better living,
Sent him to school and slaved for. his keep.
Theii word went round by mulga wireless,
“The coin is all Maloney’s care;
He lives like a dog; he’s tough and tireless;
Pay him well and he’ll get them there.”
The lambing ewes and the wool-blind wethers,
The dealers’ mobs from the flukey hills
With tender feet and fleece like feathers,
Maloney sought them to pay the bills.
The lad grew up. When the war-drums rattled
Their call to the best, they called to him.
Up past Kokoda the town boy battled
To die in the jungle dank and grim...
A station line for the northern Mallee,
Some crossbred ewes for Bribaree,
A thousand head from the Lachlan Valley,
Merino lambs for Jindalee —
What does it matter to old Maloney
Where the stock-routes end or the campfires
glow?
No roads lead back to the piebald pony
Wfth a roll of swag on the saddlebow.

“Old Camp”: I can see that “Goldie”
(B. 8/9/’4B) has had experience under-
ground —which was more than could be
said for Algernon Afleck when he
started as a miner in Bayley’s Reward,
Reconstructed. On his way out Afleck
may have read a manual, even two, on
mining, so when he got down to the
Number 4 with old Tom Brown he knew
what a hammer and drill were. With
that courtesy invariably extended to the
new man, Tom offered the choice —
“Which’ll you take, the hammer or the
drill?” Not being sure of his ability to
miss his mate’s hands, Afleck chose the
drill. Starting a hole with a short drill,
Tom laid on half a dozen or more “taps,”
then snapped, “Turn the drill, man, turn
the drill.” “All right,” Afleck said. “Just
stop a second.” Then he turned the drill
end for end.

“Old Bushman”: My vote goes to the
jabiru for the bird outback with the
peculiar disposition. He has all the
characteristics of an old boundary-
rider. Once on a vast northern cattle-
run it was my fate, day after day, to ride
a line of lagoons for bogged stock ; lone
picturesque spots they were, too, where
the black water-lily-covered surfaces
were contrasted sharply with the whites
of paper-barks, and where, each day on
each water, I found the same old “black-
necked storks”—as the jabirus were
known locally—always on their own. If
two birds happened on one waterhole
they were usually at opposite ends. Some-
times you would find the feathered giants
standing as a stork might be expected to
stand —silently on one leg ; at other times
you would see them quietly wading about
seeking prey. Every now and again the
black-and-white flier would hop along
with great strides, then he would jump
at fish with his huge black bill. These
solitary creatures did not mind anyone
on a horse, but at the sight of a man on
foot they were off. But, like old
boundary-riders, they seem to remain
bachelors, I’ve never met anyone who
has ever seen a nest.
“M.S.”: Broadley’s joke-block (B.
1/9/’4B) recalls a legend still told in a
mining township on the Speck’s west
coast. A couple of decades ago some go-
ahead citizen imported a movie, the first
the inhabitants had seen, and hired the
village hall. It was a warm night and
the side-doors stood open. The tyro
operating the projector developed a fine
set of nerves at the gala first-night, and
at times was quite unable to focus the
projector on the screen. The audience
watched with breathless awe, sometimes
following the thrilling story on the screen
and sometimes on the adjacent walls.
The operator became more and more
flustered. The film flickered through to
the point where the hero chased the
rustlers on horseback. As the nags gal-
loped madly off the screen the audience
swivelled in their seats to cheer the hero
on. Carried away by excitement one
cocky stood up and bawled, “Shut the
ruddy door or the blankards ’ll get out! ”

“Dingle”: “Lower Tops’l” is on the
wrong tack when he states (B. 18/8/’4B)
that the Huon Chief is still sailing the
seas. It is many years since the 28-ton,
65ft.-long craft traded outside the
Channel ports and Derwent. But if he
really wants a veteran, my nomination for
regular inter-State commerce is the 146-
ton iron schooner Coomonderry, still
logging her 30-odd yearly trips from
Smithton (Tas.) to Melbourne. Built of
Lowmoor iron, as was her sister-ship
the Meinderry, sunk in Newcastle harbor,
the Coom was an arrival in this colony
in the early ’eighties. Wrecked at South
Burnie in 1925, she was reconstructed and
has just had a new stern fitted. Powered
with a 240-h.p. diesel, she is now owned
“Now, Wait till I say ‘paid for.' ”
by the Kauri Timber Company, and in
this trade has already freighted over 50
million super, feet of Tassie timbers
across the tempestuous Strait.

“Shamuseen”: Despite the seeming in-
vulnerability of their hide, wild pigs are
sensitive to mosquitoes, and Cape York
(N.Q.) Binghi employs the firelighting
dodge (B. 15/9/’4B) to attract them from
their retreat in the wellnigh impenetrable
scrubs. The Captain Cookers make for the
smoke with the same alacrity as the poli-
tician for a safe seat.
■* * * *
“Zake”: Wizened old Joe Tremlett
was only around eight stone, which was
just as well for the ancient, boney moke
on which he sometimes rode into the
township. Some of the residents could
dimly remember when the prad last was
seen doing a trot; now it took Joe the
best part of an hour, with sundry stops
and periods when both mount and rider
would amble along both almost asleep,
to cover the mile or so from his place
to the town. One day Joe had tied his
horse to the hitching-rail and was inside
the Royal soaking up some tepid suds
when two of the town kids poked their
heads inside the bar door and shrilled
to Joe that his horse had fallen down.
On receipt of which grave tidings Joe
banged down his pot and shrilled back':
“A man can’t leave ’is ’orse five minutes
but what someone gets messin’ about
with ’im. Captain wouldn’t fall over on
’is own. I believe it was you young var-
mints yerselves—you’ve gorn an’ leaned
on ’im!”
* * * *
“C.E.”: Nothing startling in the
ability to recognise sheep while passing
them at speed in a car (B. 15/9/’4B). A
sheep-brand usually sticks out plainly
enough, and anyone in the game would
pick it up at a glance. Without time to
read the earmarks, and barring size and
condition, there is little to distinguish
mobs of the same breed but the brand,
though individual animals can be picked
out very often. Working with old Jim,
I’ve often seen him point casually to a
ewe and say: “X want her d’rectly.”
Then, after an hour mustering, he’d roam
through a bunch of 500 or 600 in the
yard and suddenly pounce on the ewe
he’d mentioned. “Easy enough to tell
’em,” he’d answered me, “even when
they’re culled to an even line. This ’un?
Big light ewe with three wrinkles on the
nose, Y’ might strike ’em with a darker
tinge somewhere, or it might be a couple
o’ grass-seeds on the head, or a few loose
strands o’ wool hanging somewhere.
There’s usually something about ’em.
Even if it’s only an ugly look on their
mugs.” I haven’t yet seen Jim make a
mistake.
* * * •
“The Bobuc”: The marsupial described
by “8.A.” (B. 15/9/’4B) is the mountain
possum. The aristocrat of the species,
he is found in the Alps, extending from
the Baw Baws up to the high ranges near
the Queensland border; his habitat is
along the waters flowing from both sides
of the main Divide, his favorite haunts
being the blackwoods, sassafras and
woolly butt trees,, where the musk and
hazel groves are densest. He is a nomad,
wandering over many miles by night in
quest of a varied diet. A keen bushman
will often see where he has feasted on
the hopbush leaves, chewed to a pulp
and spat out in cuds the size of broad-
beans. He climbs to the high reaches of
the woollybutts, the bark of which he
scarifies, in a powerful overarm action,
whereas the silver-grey and commoner
varieties scamper and bound upwards.
His favorite food is the heart of the tnale
tree-fern, which can only be obtained
through man’s assistance. I have often
felled the male fern, splitting it open;
the following morning the coconut-like
kernel would be eaten completely. The
easiest of all bush creatures to tame, his
vocal gutturals resemble those of the he-
goat. The aboriginals relished his flesh
as a delicacy. In the language of the
mountain tribes he was called the
“bobuc.” For beauty and quality his
winter coat is the best of all Australian
fauna.
“Anzac”: Recognised “B.A.’s” mar-
supial (B. 15/9/’4B) immediately. It’s
the “ringtailed roarer,” known to every
timber-worker in the high country. It
feeds on the corks of winebottles and
spends most of its nights stamping its
feet on the -roofs of treefellers’ huts. It
peers through the cracks in the walls
and gibbers wildly, rolling its red-rimmed
eyes and cracking its long tail like a
stockwhip. Last time I saw one was way
back in the winter of ’39, just before the
missus took out the prohibition order,
* * * *
“Bon Accord”: A human parallel to
that incident of the wheat-head travel-
ling around a fowl’s body (B. 25/8/’4B)
was that of a Bunbury (W.A.) youngster
who, addicted to chewing wheat, had a
seed lodge in a hollow tooth. A per-
sistent nagging toothache caused the
offending molar to be removed. In the
following weeks neuralgia, among other
things, was blamed for the pain in the
jaw, until finally an X-ray revealed a
foreign body along the jawbone. An
operation removed a 2in. shoot of wheat, *
♦ * * ♦
“Moujik”:,. Despite what “G’snatcher”
(B. 8/9/’4B) may have learned from an
ancient Arab writer, or from a bearded
shepherd of the Bekaa Plain, I still main-
tain that the Baalbek which he saw was
built by Antoninus Pius, and so its build-
ing and its downfall were compassed
under the full light of comparatively
modern history. Earlier Baalbek was
known to the Greeks of Asia as Helio-
polis, the Place of the Sun. Actually the
worship of Baal was a sun-worship, and
despite all the railings of Hebrew pro-
phets it was a comparatively pure
religion, as also was the worship of Isis
and Osiris. Fantastical stories such as
his bearded shepherd related concerning
the compulsory servitude of maidens to
the temple, there to sell their charms,
etc., belong to the worship of Ashtoreth,
the queen deity of Babylon. Which is
why Stead once referred to Chicago as
the modern Babylon. A. Pius adopted
Marcus Aurelius, whose literary Medi-
tations are as modern as if just off the
press the week before last. As for
Solomon building Baalbek, archaeology
has long revealed that Solomon’s temple
had dbout the same comparison to the
magnificence of Thebes and Babylon as
the modern suburban bethel has to St.
haul’s and St. Peter’s.

“Gravelsnatcher”: While the Council
was arguing about the time it takes for
a snake to die after it’s been killed (B.
15/9/’4B) the curator of the Perth
Museum was opening a parcel marked
“Dead Snake.” The consignee would
have been amazed at the speed with
which the deceased propelled itself from
the container and wriggled across the
floor. It was recaptured, identified as a
whip-snake and, later, released. So at
least one reptile-basher may boast that
snakes remain alive for a long while after
he kills them.
DREAM.
As I went walking, walking,
Along the Berwick road,
I met a girl, I met a girl,
And then I met a child.
The day was bright, the road was bright,
The wind was bright and wild,
I met a girl, I met a girl,
And then I met a child.
(The future loomed ahead so blue,
Mysterious and grey
As I walked up the Berwick road
In search of Harkaway.
The past was like a sunflower
Irradiant with gold,
I did not notice any clouds
Or loneliness or cold.)
The day was bright, the sun was bright,
The wind was bright and wild,
As I went walking, walking,
I met a girl: a child.
As I went walking, walking,
Along the Berwick road,
The magpies sang, the robins sang,
The very dust was gay,
As I walked up the«Berwick road,
In search of Harkaway.

CATTLE AT MELBOURNE SHOW
“Mr.”: Beef numbers were
only slightly in excess of last
year’s, yet they made one of the
finest displays ever seen in Mel-
bourne. As usual, N.S.W. was
well represented and won most
of the honors, though some went
to well-known Victorian studs.
In the dual-purpose section
the 190 dairy Shortfiprns made
the greatest numerical gain on
last year’s figures (33 p.c.), and
in the dairy-cattle section the
Friesians (193) made the biggest
advance, more than doubling
their 1947 total. A.I.S. were
next with 299 head (30 p.c. in-
crease), due to the large N.S.W.
invasion. The Jerseys were
strong at 471 head, but receded
a fraction compared with last
year’s entry (495).
The Beeves.
Aberdeen-Angus attracted a
great deal of attention. The little
blacks have captured the
imagination of people other than
breeders and butchers, resulting
in a large and appreciative
crowd in attendance most of the
time. The champion bull, Wal-
lah Ottoman, from the three-
year-old class, was bred by Wal-
lah Pastoral Co., Narrabri, and
had the obvious characteristics
of the breed —small proportion
of bone and offals to total dead-
weight, hardiness, well-developed
quarters and every indication of
a “good doer.” The reserve,
Booroomooka Quartz, exhibited
and bred by H. Gordon Munro,
notched a close second. The
yearling, Kahlua Sir Francis
(Kahlua Pastoral Co.), won the
junior male championship.
Polled Shorthorns are making
little headway in Victoria. Last
year’s two entries were increased
this year to five, each unopposed
in its class. In the horned sec-
tionsi, however, 104 paraded,
one more than last year’s record.
Reds and red roans pre-
ponderated over roans and
whites. The champion, Coonong
Ringleader, exhibited by Lith-
gow and Ross, and sired by
Coonong Legionnaire, was bred
by D. R. McCaughey. A beauti-
fully-balanced animal. Ring-
leader exhibited most of the
points for which the breed is
noted —ample rib-spread, deep
strong quarters, plenty of width
in front and short, sturdy legs.
The head, strong and masculine,
is carried proudly. C. P. Fair-
bairn’s Woomargarma Magis-
trate, a nicely-balanced red, is
reserve champion,
Herefords attracted an appre-
ciative gallery. Entries came
from near and far —N.S.W. and
Queensland being well repre-
sented. The male champion,
two-year-old Ardno Dictator,
bred by the exhibitor, R, L. Mc-
Eachern, was sired by Golf Hill
Artist. The popularity of this
breed is possibly due to its true-
ness to type. You never see a
Hereford that looks anything
other than a Hereford, and the
marking is always clean and
sharp, something you don’t
always find with some other
breeds. The ability of the Here- >,
ford to pass on its white face
and distinctive red coat is a
noted characteristic. In this
respect it’s interesting to note
that the Hereford Herd Book
has been closed since 1884. The
18-months-old bull Bon Spiel
Royal Highness was reserve
champion. This youngster, bred
and exhibited by H. R. Spencer,
gives promise of greater achieve-
ments. *
Dual-purpose Breeds.
Red Polls are holding their
own in Victoria, though three of
the championships went to
N.S.W. Bundaleer Stud,
Bathurst (Perry Bros.), won
champion and reserve champion-
ship sashes in the male classes
and the reserve championship in
the female section. The nicely-
balanced champion bull, Bunda-
leer Beauhead, was closely chal-
lenged by his team-mate, Bunda-
leer Bombastic. Among the
females Bundaleer Boronova
had to give way to Niawanda
Baronia, bred and exhibited byr
A. R. Beggs, Beaufort (Vic.).
Dairy Shorthorns fielded 190
head, an advance of 63 on last
year. The breed was well repre-
sented by the champion bull,
Willow Park Rosy Barrington
30th, a nice red with very little
white. This four-year-old was
bred at Willow Park Stud,
which is always a consistent per-
former in the Victorian Herd
Test. The reserve went to the
three - year - old bull Morven
Count Rubio 39th, bred by
Kerr Bros. The roan four-year-
old Morven Cressida, also bred
by Kerr Bros., took the cham-
pionship in the female section.
Reserve .was- Willow Park
Duchess 79th.
Dairy Breeds.
Dairy breeds were well repre-
sented, as might be expected,
seeing that Victoria produces
one-third of Australia’s butter.
A.I.S. were up 53 on last year’s
total (182), due to a spectacular
invasion from exhibitors north
of the Murray. The four-year-
old bull, Alne Park Glen, bred
and owned by G. E. Chittick,
took the championship, J. M.
Newton and Sons’ Parkview
Baldwin (s. Parkview Baritone)
running hm a close second.
Selecting the winner must have
given the judges a headache. The
champion cow, Tabbagong
Beauty 31st, also came from
N.S.W.
The handsome Ayrshires
made one of the most attractive
displays. Five-year-old and un-
defeated champion in three
States (Vic., N.S.W. apd S.A.),
Glengowrie Flash Baron, 1946
and 1947 Melbourne champion,
lorded it over all-comers. His
owners, A. Facey and Sons, also
won the reserve championship
with a nicely-marked brown-
and-white three-year-old , bull,
Glengowrie Baron Again, On
present indications, if the cham-
pion is ever to be defeated, this
young bull is the one to do it.
T. S. Paternoster bred and ex-
hibited the champion cow,
Uroonda Peeress,
Jerseys, in their own per-
manent ring, attracted large
crowds. Although there was the
inevitable tail inseparable from
champion, Yarraview Foremost,
owned by Dr. F. G. Stephens
and last year’s champion. Glen-
oak Morning’s Glory took the
female championship. This
mature cow (nine-year-old) was
champion at Sydney and reserve
champion at Melbourne last
year.
On last year’s figures (82) the
Friesians made the most spec-
tacular advance (193), and seem
to have gone a long way to over-
coming the Victorian dairy-
farmers’ prejudice to the breed.
Champion bull, Galaview Poli-
tician, an eight-year-old, is
owned and was bred by the ex-
hibitor, J. T. Platfuss. Kelvale
Evan (H. T. Owen) took the re-
serve. The 11-year-old cow,
Ingolston Topsy, owned and
bred by T. Gilmore, won the
female championship, with Mrs.
D. J. Edwards and Son’s Gala-
view Stately Pietertje (seven-
year-old) in reserve.
Woolclassing Standards.
“J.R.D.”: While the various
Graziers’ Associations can do
much to keep before their mem-
bers the necessity for employing
an experienced classer (B.
“Keep Strawb under observation; she's got a touch of
spring-fever."
such a big entry, the tops in
most cases were of excellent
breed, type and quality. The
champion bull, Bellavista Signal-
man Royal, came from C. S.
Walker’s Swan Hill stud.
Handsome and nicely marked,
this young four-year-old was
bred by Bellavista Estates, Ltd.
The reserve, Manuden Musician,
aged, was exhibited by R. C.
Cole (N.S.W.). Champion cow,
Belgonia Marie 21st, was bred
at Belgonia, Tongala (Vic.), by
P. J. Maloney, This champion-
ship wins for Maloney the Jersey
Herd Society’s gold cup (three
championship awards). Reserve
championship went to Kingsvale
Linda 103rd (J. Anderson and
Son).
Guernseys are gaining in
favor. This year’s 188 was a
marked advance on the 1947
figure (146), and the support ac-
corded the breed, if ringside
comment is to be taken into con-
sideration, augurs well for the
future. Yarraview blood was
again to the fore, Yarraview
Highcaste, a nicely - marked
orange-and-white four-year-old,
taking the male championship.
This handsome animal is owned
by A. H. Barclay, Tongala, and
was bred by Captain Payne,
of Yarraview. The same breeder
was responsible for the reserve
29/9/’4B), the final responsi-
bility lies with the individual
woolgrower, and far too many
of them look for a man who will
do the job at the lowest rate of
pay. .
In any case, most criticism
must be levelled at the owner
of around 1000 sheep. His only
opportunity of obtaining a good
classer is to have his sheep shorn
at a big shed or to form a depot
shed with a number of neigh-
bors so as to make the total
number of sheep large enough to
attract a good , man. The only
other alternative is to give up
all thought of classing the wool
at the shed and to dispatch it
direct to a reliable reclassing
firm.
It is to be hoped that the
criticism will be taken up by
graziers and their, associations.
There is room for a lot of plan-
ning for the better preparation
of smaller clips, and this is a
matter that district associations
can take up for the benefit or
their members.
Local reclassing establish-
ments are not necessarily the
answer to the problem, as many
flocks nowadays are too small
to give a single line large enough
to enter the Big Lots catalogue,
and any such establishment
would have to be operated on
its ability to make the most of
odd lots of wool, either by blend-
ing or by a pooling system. The
latter is the answer to most of
the problems, but can only be
done successfully on a big scale.
Thus it would be possible to
obtain sufficient of each type of
wool to make them up into
lines for arranging as market-
able lots without having to hold
part of the' clip for months be-
yond 'its normal selling date.
This is where the larger wool-
pooling units have the advan-
tage, as the more wool that is
handled the larger are the lots
made, and as the bins fill up
quicker they can be marketed
without delay.
The Merino Embargo.
“He-Ne”: Federal Agricul-
ture Minister Pollard has re-
fused to lift the embargo on the
export of Australian Merino
rams. A Canberra report has it
that the embargo is now ex-
tended to Merino semen so as
to stop overseas breeders from
evading the ram embargo by
using artificial insemination. I
can’t help wondering whether all
this isn’t likely to do the Merino
woolgrower more harm than
good in the long run.
Main reason put forward by
advocates of the ban is that it
preserves for Australia for all
time the great Merino industry.
While this might be a comfort-
ing theory, it is a dangerously
inaccurate one. The embargo
cannot protect the Merino in-
dustry simply by forcing
woolbuyers from all over the
world to come here and pur-
chase their requirements.
The most formidable enemy
the Merino industry has is not
foreign woolgrowing competi-
tion but, paradoxically enough,
the very lack of it. Lack of
local wool production in all
major industrial countries drives
the cloth-manufacturer to syn-
thetics, If the United States,
Russia, France and Germany (to
mention only four) had vigorous
Merino flocks and the wearing
of pure wool was general, it
would be of tremendous import
to Australia, because all oversea
Merino-breeders would have to
come to Australia for Merino
stud animals, just as Australian
beef-, dairy cattle- and thorough-
bred horse-breeders now have to
go to Britain to strengthen their

Townsville Lucerne.
“Agric”: Experiments at
Rodds Bay, near Gladstone (Q.),
by the C.S.I.R. suggest that
Townsville lucerne may be the
legume for incorporation in
natural pastures in summer-rain-
fall areas. Townsville lucerne
was first sown at Rodds Bay 12
years ago, seed being scattered
over a few square yards; in
1945 patches could be found for
a distance of about half a mile
all round the original plot. Ap-
plications of super, have greatly
increased the growth since trials
were begun in 1945; a dressing
of 2cwt, per acre in October of
that year increased the yield in
1946 by 120 p.c., by 145 p.c.
in 1947 and 155 p.c. in 1948.
Gallon College experiments
have shown that it is possible to
introduce lucerne into Rhodes-
grass pastures, and that the re-
sulting pasture is superior to
pure Rhodes grass. Trials with
the two classes of pastures have
been in progress for 2\ years.
Stock gained weight on both pas-
tures in summer and lost in
winter, but those on Rhodes and
lucerne made much better gains
in summer. At the end of the
first two years the steers on
Rhodes and lucerne were 2001 b.
heavier than those on Rhodes
alone; in winter weight losses
were nearly equal. Rhodes
grass has made much better
growth in . the presence of
lucerne; in fact, at present ani-
mals have had to be removed
from the pure Rhodes-grass pas-
tures, whereas the Rhodes and
lucerne pastures are still carry-
ing stock. On some soils, at
least, says Norman H. Shaw, re-
search-officer of the C.5.1.R.,
lucerne can be used to improve
Rhodes-grass pastures, but the
resulting pasture improves only
summer grazing; it does not
overcome the major difficulty of
loss of weight in winter.
Corn-sacks.
“C.S.”: The failure of
second-hand bags to stand up to
lengthy storage, particularly in
N.S.W., this year, has vindicated
the Australian Wheat Board’s
policy to accept wheat only in
new corn-sacks. Second-hand
sacks will not be accepted for
bagged-wheat deliveries .this year
in any State; there will be
sufficient supplies of new corn-
sacks available to meet the full
requirements of growers. Owing
to uncertainty regarding con-
tinuance of the board, corn-
sacks will be sold to wheat- and
barley-growers only for cash.
Hints for the Farm.
“Plane Creek”: For greasy
heel in horses, a weak bluestone
solution is ideal (B. 14/7/’4B).
Wash the affected parts with it
and they should soon dry. It
cured a case of long standing in
a Clydesdale I owned—after
fully a dozen other remedies had
failed. A bottle of the remedy
may be made up and kept in the
veterinary medicine-chest in case
of emergency.
“Gravelsnatcher”: A Perth
man has invented a D.D.T. spray
that fits on the exhaust of a milk-
ing-machine. The idea is to pro-
vide an easy way of spraying
dairies at practically no cost, and
since practically all W.A.’s
dairies are machine-equipped the
scheme should be welcomed.
The spray can also be attached
to a vacuum - cleaner. It
shouldn’t be a hard matter to
adapt a similar device to the
exhaust of a truck, and spray the
paddocks whenever the truck is
used.
“Bill C”: Arousing interest
on Darling Downs (Q.) wheat
farms, where erosion is a
problem, is the stubble-mulching
device invented by J. A. Stevens,
ot Tamworth (N.S.W.). It is
fitted to a scarifier, and its two
reciprocating rakes, which have
140 teeth between them, draw
the refuse back as the land is
worked. The stubble is left on
the surface, and the mulch is
very useful for conserving
moisture, keeping the soil loose,
and for limiting weed-growth.
The device may be used success-
fully in heavy grain crops, and
could be used in canefields if the
mechanism were strengthened.
“Ben Acre”: If sal-ammoniac
is unobtainable, tin the soldering-
iron with broken spirits salts.
Pour a shallow pool on to a
piece of tin, drop a pebble of
solder into it, and, after cleaning
the iron, rub it in the spirits,
melting the solder on to the iron
at the same time.
“Big Billy”; Some control of
walnut blight may be secured by
Bordeaux-mixture spray applied
in the spring just before female
flowers have opened, again after
the fruit has set and a third spray
10 days later. Dissolve 4oz. of
copper sulphate in 2igal. of
water in a non-metallic vessel,
mixing 4oz. of slaked lime in
another container and combin-
ing these two solutions in a third
non-metallic vessel.
“R.N.”: The Guthrie Corrie-
dale stud, Elcho, near Geelong
(Vic.), has sold the two-year-old
special stud ram, R.B. 86, to the
famous N.Z. stud Bushey Park
for the Australian record of
1250gns. A twin son of Record
Breaker, for which Guthrie paid
lOOOgns. and which, still at Bui
gandra, the other Guthrie stud,
has sired some outstanding sheep,
R.B. 86 goes to Bushey Park to
take some of the best Australian
blood back to N.Z., home of the
Corriedales.

Under the House
By LES ROBINSON
IF you five in a habitation
built on piles a few feet above
the ground and don’t use
the space underneath it your-
self you will be mildly surprised,
perhaps, after a while, as I was,
especially if your surroundings
are senv- if not wholly-rural,
by the number of occupants,
some permanent, others only
temporary (you hope) the space
between the ground and the floor
acquires.
Those among them that are
silent —ants, ant-lions and lion-
esses, centipedes, millipedes,
slaters, scorpions, lizards and
spiders merely to mention a few
—may have been using it as a
residence for a long time.
All of them, you are bound
to notice sooner or later, appear
to be imbued with the belief that
the house was built well above
the ground solely, for their bene-
fit. You will notice, as well,
probably, that your attitude to-
wards them, whatever it may be,
doesn’t seem to concern them in
the least and that they don’t
care either whether they are a
nuisance to you or not. Serves
you right for being there. You
are only an incubus, anyway.
They remind you at times, in
fact, of some of your fellow-
men.
THE usurper, or intruder, that
annoyed me most was a dog.
He was large, unkempt, ungainly,
mangy, churlish and aggressive.
Most of his time was spent in
barking and in scratching him-
self. He had the biggest bark
in the neighborhood. Bullying
the other dogs in it, being larger
than all save one or two of
them, seemed to be his hobby. I
dubbed him “Skainjy.” It
seemed to suit him somehow.
He knew that I disliked him
and used to wait until I’d gone
to bed before slinking under.
Sometimes, if not too tired. I’d
get up and hunt him out, but
always when I did he came back
later.
As he scratched himself he
moaned, whined, growled,
grunted, snorted, groaned and
made other sounds that were ex-
traordinary and not doglike at
all. They might, in fact, easily
have been mistaken for the
maunderings of an old man who
was pessimistic, disgruntled,
cantankerous and peculiar. If
“Going anywhere near Tel-Aviv?"
I had not knpwn they were made
by “Skainjy” I would perhaps
have thought that the house was
haunted.
After a while he would sub-
side and I, too, would slumber.
Then, suddenly, in the middle
of the night or later, he would
awake, often from a bad dream
I suspected, and startle me into
wakefulness with an outburst of
barking. Continuing to inflict the
uproar upon the neighborhood
he would thereupon rush out in
pursuit of foes that he was well
aware, confound him, were im-
aginary. There were times,
though, when he was elsewhere,
for he roamed about all over the
suburb.
The other dogs it contained,
taking advantage of his absence,
then carried their bones under
the house. The sound, steady,
rhythmical and lasting for hours
of bones being crunched was
one among many at night that I
became used to hearing. It was
inescapable, as I was hying over
a dogs’ restaurant evidently, I
often told myself.
Sometimes they would quarrel
about the ownership of the bones,
and their snarling and growling
would end in a brawl. Or a
pack of them, yelping excitedly,
would dash under in pursuit of a
cat, a rabbit or a bandicoot that
may, for all I knew to the con-
trary, for I never crawled under
the house myself, have been
making for a burrow.
WHENEVER for some reason
or other the dogs ah de-
cided to spend the night in an-
other part of the suburb, and
they would vanish as though in
response to an urgent summons
now and then, the cats, which
seemed to know beforehand they
weren’t likely to be disturbed
by them, would assemble under
Doletia, as the house was
named, for a vocal contest. It
was nice and dry there in wet
weather for one thing.
On hot days in midsummer a
small flock of sheep kept by
one of the neighbors —in case
there should be a meat-strike, I
surmised —would often gaze at
me with resentment and baa with
dissatisfaction, because I didn’t
give them anything to eat, I
supposed, from under my abode
if I happened to return to it
about noon.
I never reaped any advantage
from being awakened at dawn
or soon after, but couldn’t say I
wasn’t used to it, for the neigh-
bors’ fowls preferred being under
the house to being anywhere
else, seemingly, whenever they
got out of their pens, and that, I
inferred, was as often as, by en-
larging rents in, or holes under,
the wire-netting, they felt in-
clined.
When their parents, searching
for them, had stopped yelling
at last, kids I had unwittingly
been harboring who didn’t want
to go home because they ex-
pected to be thrashed for some
misdemeanor or other would
crawl out furtively and disappear
into the scrub.
THE house was close to a road
you could walk along for
miles without finding any shade.
Occasionally, even in the day-
time, for that reason, no doubt,
I would hear, through cracks and
knot-holes in the' floor, snores
which indicated that a wayfarer,
worn out perhaps, poor fellow,
by striving to lessen the work of
the world, was steeped in slum-
ber. Knowing how hard it often
is to find some quiet place in
which to have a snooze, I re-
frained, of course, from disturb-
ing him.
The man who used to own and
live in the house before the
mortgagee permitted me to
occupy it became a nomad, and
thereafter he, too, slept under
it sometimes in preference to
sleeping on the river-bank under
the railway-bridge not far away,
and we would have breakfast
together.

Much Ado.
“The N.S.W. Deputy Prices Com-
missioner announces that he has re-
fused to grant a price rise for dolls’
panties.”
The Deputy Official Prices
Examiner looked up as a clerk
staggered in carrying a 2ft.-high
file of papers, between mill-
boards and bound with pink-
tape. “There you are, sir.
“File forty-eight, stroke one
one two nine stroke seventy-
three ; Garments, nether, dolls’;
prices for the review of.”
“Good! Now that the vastly
important • job of determining
whether or not a rise in the price
of dolls’ panties was justified
has been settled, we will push on
immediately with the even more
important task of investigating
the case of dolls’ scanties. The
question of pantettes and
bloomers will be dealt with later.
I shall be very busy on this
matter for several weeks, Mr.
Dumcluk, and don’t wish to be
disturbed by anyyne seeking an
interview.”
The next four days were haras-
sing ones for the D.O.P.E. After
much browsing through the files,
looking up the latest quotations
for buttonholing, shirring and
inching, trying to find out what
proportion of time in the mak-
ing of the completed article
would be taken up if dolls’
scanties were embroidered at the
hem or tatted, plus an intensive
study of the latest fluctuations of
the American cotton and rayon
markets, he had made a pre-
liminary note to the effect that a
rise of .019 d. per pair might be
justified if the anticipated price-
rise of a farthing a dozen reels
of cotton eventuated.
At that stage his chief-assistant
pointed out, at an urgently-called
conference of senior officers,
that many dolls’ scan t i e s
carried lace insertion. He
had heard his wife mention
Valenciennes, Brussels and
Guipure. These he understood
were of varying prices. Where
these formed the embellishment,
which sometimes look the form
of two pieces the size of a two-
shilling piece, one on each leg, it
might add as much as .25 of a
penny to each scantie, or scanties,
though he advised extreme
caution in accepting that round
figure. It was decided at the
conference that it would -he
better, where there was lace in-
sertion on only one leg, to set a
separate price for such garments.
The raising of the question
whether dolls’ scanties made of
cotton or rayon and having a
scalloped edge would be more
costly to make than those made
of such material as angel-skin,
lam 6, brocaded silk or shot
taffeta, but perfectly plain, threw
a spanner in the prices works.
The D.O.P.E. realised then that
all the calculations he had made
before, which had been on the
basis of plainly-cut scanties of
organdie or perhaps Italian cloth
or haircord, were now rendered
useless. After the conference
ended he set to work again.
Within another week the first
reports of his staff of field in-
spectors, who had been charged
with the task of checking-up on
the quantity and quality of the
elastic used in holding up dolls’
scanties, began to pour in. After
these had been collated, analysed,
checked and counter-checked, it
was found that small girls' spent
quite a lot of time pulling their
dolls’ scanties up owing to the
slackness of the elastic.
The question whether this was
caused through the elastic
stretching or because t/ie makers
put in too much elastic in the
first place called for a decision of,
vital importance. The sugges-
tion by one senior officer that the
branch should buy a doll and a
pair of doll’s scanties and that
one of the typists should be de-
puted to pull the scanties on and
off the doll several times a day
for a month to test the elasticity
of the elastic was overruled, it
being thought that the matter
was too urgent to admit of any
further delay. It was finally de-
cided that the makers could do
with Ijrin. less elastic, as any
extra tightness could cause no in-
convenience to an inanimate
object, and at the same time it
would not be too tight to pre-
vent its fivelyear-old “mother”
from removing it. This figure
meant that the cost of dolls’
scanties could straightyvay be
reduced by .033 of a penny.
Then another question arose.
That figure was based on |in.
elastic. Some small manufac-
turers used yin. Would the sav-
ing on Uin, of standard |in.
elastic be more than offset by
the use of the dearer iin. elastic?
While the D.O.P.E. was pon-
dering this knotty problem his
assistant came in with another
poser; What effect on their price
would be scanties which had a
frill on each leg or perhaps a
panel of accordion-pleating?
This threw the whole of the
Prices Branch into a turmoil.
After a few more weeks a ruling
was obtained: separate prices
where frilling was on one or
both legs.
Just as the D.O.P.E. was about
to finalise the price his assistant
came in in great agitation.
“We’re sunk! ” he said
brokenly. “We’ve been working
on scanties for silent dolls. What
the chief wants is scanties for
‘Mamma’ dolls! ”

THE OTHER FELLOW'S MIND
The contributor placed first is paid
4|d. per line; all others 2Jd. per line.
“White Exploiters”
From time to time I read references
to “white exploiters” of native workers
in Papua and New Guinea. The term is
commonly used by “Labor” supporters
and particularly by the Minister for Ex-
ternal Territories, Mr. Ward, apparently
to insinuate that our island responsibilities
are the happy hunting-ground for mono-
polistic combines and big-money interests.
Consider the commercial history of the
old Mandated Territory of New Guinea
from the time Australia assumed control
after the military occupation in 1914:
All German commercial and planting
concerns were allowed to function, under
military control, from 1914 to 1920, when
a quasi-Government Expropriation Board
was formed to take over all properties
of German nationals and companies ex-
propriated under the Act. These con-
sisted of coconut and cacao plantations,
trading-stations and big commercial and
shipping firms. The changeover entailed
replacing experienced German planters,
clerks, storekeepers and business execu-
tives with Australians, of whom 99 per
cent, were returned soldiers from the
1914-18 war with little or no experience
of tropical conditions. The adaptable
Aussies soon found their level in the new
surroundings, and, with few exceptions,
proved capable and efficient successors to
the Germans in managing coconut estates,
as schooner-masters, clerks and general
commercial workers.
As the years passed these Diggers
married and regarded the Mandated
Territory as their home. When the old
German plantations were offered for
tender, many of them became owners of
coconut estates. Several Australian island
firms were also successful tenderers, and
they employed the services of those -ex-
perienced returned-soldier Expropriation
Board employees who were either unsuc-
cessful in tendering, or without sufficient
capital to start out on their own.
Thus the commercial community of the
Mandated Territory since Australia’s
occupancy had passed through three dis- ’
tinct phases before the Pacific war blew
the lid off everything. First, from 1914
to 1920, there were the German owners
under Military Occupation control; next,
from 1920 to 1926, came the Expropria-
tion Board (with the exception of a few
Australian-owned estates), and last, from
1926 to 1942, there was private owner-
ship among returned soldiers and Aus-
tralian island firms, employing for the
most part returned soldiers.
These then are the “white exploiters”
referred to by Labor politicians whenever
commercial enterprise in New Guinea is
mentioned as an antagonising influence in
Labor’s attempt for a “fair deal” among
the natives.
When the Pacific war came and the
Japanese hordes overran the Mandated
Territory, with practically no resistance
from unprepared Australia, it was these
same men (those fortunate enough to miss
the tragic sinking of the prison-ship
Montevideo Maru) who formed the
nucleus of the Allied Intelligence and, as
a result of their local experience, played
a major part in repulsing the Nips along
the Kokoda trail and supplying valuable
information on the activities of the Jap on
New Britain and Bougainville.
Calling these Diggers “exploiters” after
they have done so much to develop and
defend New Guinea is the last word in
“Labor’s” dirty political mudslinging.—
Malolo (N.S.W.).
Medical Education
American reports quoted by the “British
Medical Journal” of July 24, 1948.
emphasise the value of medical educa-
tion of the public. The reports show that,
although doctors are more likely to die
of disease induced by high-pressure work
and worry (such as blood pressure and
heart disease), they have a much better
chance than the general public of sur-
viving illnesses in which early diagnosis
and treatment are indicated.
Diseases which kill the layman more
frequently than the medico are cancer,
appendicitis, rupture, nephritis, ulcer of
the duodenum and stomach, and tuber-
culosis. In the last case the doctor’s
chances are twice as good. As these
diseases afflict all sections of the com-
munity equally, the conclusion is that the
doctor’s special knowledge enables him
to realise the significance of his symp-
toms and seek early treatment with suc-
cessful results.
Two factors would give the layman a
better chance —medical education and
freedom from financial loss through sick-
ness. Medical education is being spread
by various authorities, but with inerfeased
Government aid the result could be
greatly magnified, freedom from
financial loss could be easily overcome.
At present the man without financial
means gets the best medical service free,
while the rich pay for their attention ;
the middleman pays the same fees as the
wealthy.
If the “free”-medicine funds were
used for diagnostic services they would
help the community and the country in-
stead of producing a doubtful amount of
benefit and a known amount of mischief.
—Jock (S.A.).
Wheat Stabilisation
“Jonean” (B. 15/9/’4B) only repeated
most of the half-truths uttered by ex-
politicos and aspiring politicians of the
N.S.W. Farmers and Settlers’ Association.
He claims that concessional sales have
cost the Australian wheatgrower £7O mil-
lion or so during the past few years.
Look at the other side of the matter.
Australian wheatgrowers, since 1930, have
been directly paid £33 million in sub-
sidies and drought-relief. Other con-
cessions, such as writing-down of capital
debt, rail-freights, etc., bring the grand
total of assistance to 54,000-odd wheat-
growers in the last 18 years to between
£6O and £BO million.
As to wheatmen handling their own
marketing, I’m afraid there would never'
be sufficient unanimity among them to
even decide on its fundamentals. Wheat-
growers, as a body, never seem to agree
on anything. One has only to consider
the opinions of the three N. S. Wales
growers’ organisations on the forthcoming
stabilisation referendum. Two are urging
a No vote and the other a Yes vote,
though the three are affiliated with a body
which has affirmed, in principle, the Pol-
lard plan.
But the weakness of co-op. marketing
does not lie in divided opinion. What-
ever grower organisations might claim,
the only body which can guarantee a floor
price is the Commonwealth Government.
in those circumstances, unreasonable
for the Government to require some con-
trol on how money from consolidated
revenue is likely to be spent?
Like the wheatgrowers, “Jonean” would
keep the cake but eat it, too. When
wheat is 2s. to 3s. a bushel he claims
it just and fair that he be supported by
the taxpayer, but when it soars he con-
veniently forgets that same taxpayer and
wants to take the lot. — Waldo (N.S.W.).
Hanlon, New-Stater
Premier Hanlon has promised to recom-
mend New States for Queensland when
his Government’s development policy has
built up new industries and given the
necessary financial and economic stability
to justify such States. What is this
“Play by ear, do you? Then you Want to consult an E.N. and T.
specialist."
developmental policy? True, the Gov-
ernment has put forward a number of
proposals which seem to be strictly con-
fined to developing primary industries,
but few seem to show any sign of passing
the planning stage.
The abundance of cheap coal at Blair
Athol and elsewhere should attract new
industries to Central and North Queens-
land without much assistance. What is
Mr. Hanlon doing about encouraging
these? The Minister for Railways,
Duggan, possibly supplied the answer
when he said: “The Railway Department
is obliged to use coal (from Blair Athol)
for the running of these railways at
58s. 3d. (freight) plus 18s. 6d. (coal cost),
a total of 765. 9d. a ton, in order that
private enterprise may continue to draw
coal at 255. 9d. a ton plus about 4s. 3d.
freight from West Moreton to Brisbane.”
Thus, provided the coals are of equal
value (they are not, since Blair Athol
coal is not gas coal and has a high
moisture content), the department allows
itself 11s. 6d. per ton for hauling Blair
Athol coal 635 miles to Brisbane. Since
the normal freight charge for that distance
was then 575. Bd., a reduction of 80 per
cent, was made to assist such “private”
enterprises as the Brisbane City Council
and gas and electricity and other com-
panies.
Freights and coal cost at pithead have
since been raised, so West Moreton coal
now costs 38s. per ton Brisbane and Blair
Athol coal, which should cost 985., is still
being used to keep the price of West
Moreton coal low. The railways, there-
fore, forgo 60s. per ton to subsidise in-
dustries in Brisbane, and are no doubt
losing £3 or more on every ton carried,
since those employed on opencut mining
at| Blair Athol provide little back-loading
for the returning trucks.
We hear nothing about reduced freights
on coal to Emerald or Rockhampton,
where the price would be about 365. 9d,
and 61s. sd. respectively— too much for
the establishment of industries there. In
1915, when Labor came to power, there
were a number of prosperous foundries
and general engineering works in Central
and North Queensland; one even in
Winton. Where are they now? The one
that has prospered did so by moving its
manufacturing department to N. S. Wales.
The others have languished or faded right
out.
- Is it any wonder that Mr. Hanlon feels
safe in making his promise with those
conditions attached? Or that the last
census showed that, while the population
of Brisbane increased by 34.17 per cent.,
that of Central and North Queensland
increased by only 5.3 per cent, and 5.9 per
cent. —C. B. D. (Q.).
Men and Machines
Some of the most interesting advertise-
ments these days are those of firms
supplying equipment for factories, agri-
culture, transport, building and com-
merce. The emphasis is on man-hours.
Only by installing labor-saving devices,
the ads. suggest, can employers make a
profit on those 40 brief and highly-paid
hours,
When inviting a businessman or farmer
to invest hundreds or thousands of
pounds you must make a fairly logical
appeal. Man-hours are, of course, a very
real issue, and in the coming decade
ways of getting work done with few
workers will improve as never before.
Those who take present conditions for
granted may be astonished at how
quickly the work-shy become workless.
Over a period mechanisation of in-
dustry improves the welfare of the work-
ing class, as of others. Machines
eliminate back-breaking work and im-
prove living standards. But meanwhile
men lose their jobs, and, unless they are
young and adaptable, they may not be
able to get others. Desirable in itself,
mechanisation creates social stresses that
are undesirable.
Where the labor force is efficient and
competitive its displacement is gradual
and reabsorption of displaced workers
more feasible. With labor half-hearted
or downright cantankerous —as at pre-
sent —mechanisation is "Stalled by lack of
capital equipment. When it does get
going, however, it will bolt, leaving the
unwary waiting perhaps years for the
expanding economy to find room for
them again.— Robert Howie (W.A.).
Twofold Bay #
The reply to Victorian Premier Holl-
way by N. S. Wales Deputy Premier
Baddeley on the development of Eden
(N.S.W.) might have been more com-
mendable if it had been accurate. Far
from rejecting the proposal to develop
the Twofold Bay area, the Parliamentary
Standing Committee on Public Works in
1892 did, in fact, suggest that Eden be
linked with the N. S. Wales railway sys-
tem with a view to its development as a
seaport. This report, in the Mitchell
Library, Sydney, reveals many things
that might surprise even Mr. Baddeley.
For instance:
Twofold 8ay.... is a harbor where a
large and satisfactory trade could be carried
on with advantage to the districts connected
with it and Colony generally.
And about that railway:
Without distinctly recommending a cheap
railway from Eden to Bega, they are of the
opinion that the construction of such a
railway might be favorably considered. It
appears to the committee that it may be
15 years or more before a railway from
Eden to Bega is likely to be connected with
either the southern railway at Cooma or the
South Coast railway at Nowra.
Apparently those 19th-century poli-
ticians, far from painting a gloomy pic-
ture, erred rather on the side of opti-
mism. The committee listed the follow-
ing points as favorable for the proposed
railway:
The importance of Twofold Bay as a
harbor, which can only be properly utilised
by making it, with the aid of a railway, the
principal outlet for the districts west and
north of it.
The present importance of the Bega
district as a thriving centre of farming
operations.
The opportunity, from the fertility of the
district, for an increase of settlement and
production.
The amount contributed by the district
to the general revenue.
Even in 1892 politicians realised that
there was every justification for the de-
velopment of the Twofold Bay area.—
J. B. R. (N.S.W.).
Housing
For 19 months; I’ve been living with
my wife and three children at the Heme
Bay housing settlement (N.S.W.). Our
“flat” is one of three in what was
formerly an American hut. We have a
reasonable amount of space, but the walls
are so thin that we can almost hear our
neighbors breathe. The place is cold and
draughty, even with every door and win-
dow closed, and our baby has already
had pneumonia. '
The settlement is decidedly over-
crowded, and there is nobody I know
who is not longing to leave. Some of
the huts are in good condition; others
are very bad. That, of course, depends
to some extent on the tenant.
Within a few miles of the settlement
there are dozens of Housing Commission
cottages being built. Despite priorities,
power of direction and other advantages
enjoyed by the commission, these cot-
tages have been on the way for many
months. One group is still unfinished
after nearly two years, —D.R. I.
(N.S.W.).
Lotteries
Labor in S.A. is still toying with the
idea of a State lottery (B. 1/9/’4B), eVen
though opposition to the scheme is strong.
Two weak arguments are commonly
advanced in favor of a lottery. The first
is that inter-State lotteries “take money
out of the State.” The amount of cash
going to “consultations” in other States,
however, is not very harmful to SA.’s
economy, whereas a local lottery would
take far more ready cash from Crow-
eaters in general, to their later regret.
For the last few years Friday in S.A.
has been called “Button Day.” On the
way to work, J, Cit. is stopped by firm
but friendly young things selling
for well-known charities buttons ranging
from 6d. up to a fiver. This good-natured
badgering is held up as another argu-
ment for lotteries: “Must we for ever
endure this legalised begging in the streets
of city and country each week?” But if
a man can’t part with a zac once a week
for the “Salvos” or the U.N.O. appeal
for starving children or some other
charity, he must be hard-up— too hard-
up to buy a lottery-ticket.
A day in Sydney, Brisbane or Perth is
enough to see how the lottery and “art-
union” craze has triumphed. There are
not only the lottery-ticket merchants with
their lucky numbers and gutter-appeal
advts., but also the pest who sells “art-
union” tickets. I bought one in August
with a number in the three millions!
Even Melbourne is beset by “art-
unions,” although it has so far escaped a
lottery. A South Australian can point to
his local authorities with some pride, both
annoyances having been resisted by a
succession of Governments. No change
of attitude is apparent among Playford’s
henchmen, and even on the opposite
benches there is a strong feeling against
the proposal. — Karrimba (S.A.),


the biggest skite in its history. Having
somehow or other surmounted Chif’s
taxation fences and his armies of officials,
horses, dogs, Shorthorns, red Polls, Berk-
shires, Tamworths, giant cheeses, mangel-
wurzels, mountains of butter and other
indications of a land of plenty in a
world of shortage were pouring into the
State’s shop-window from Portland, Wan-
garatta and Cape Howe per medium of
crammed railway trucks^-160 of them —
and gargantuan floats and transports.
A tossing sea .of bowler hats and black
habits filled the vast arena where those
infallible Solons, the judges, walked
around pretending to differentiate between
one ornate piece of horseflesh and an-
other when anybody could see that every
animal was’ perfect. In the howling-dog
pavilion, where an all-time high has been
achieved in entries, Pomeranian bitches,
French poodles, Pekinese pups and other
pampered creatures were languishing in
cretonne-upholstered cages, lolling on
silk cushions or being paraded before
Mr. Marples, the English expert, in an
atmosphere heavy with the scent of
pomades and hair lotions.
In the sheep pavilion a pure Merino
which, could point to an unbroken descent
from the royal flock of George 111
through the flock of Captain John Mac-
arthur at Camden was contemptuously
comparing present-day wool prices with
the 10s. 6d. a pound its predecessors got
in 18th-century England.
It was an austerity Show, however.
Down a lane between the machinery
pavilions a gentleman was guessing the
weight of stout middle-aged women for a
fee of one shilling and lost a packet of
cigarettes or a box of chocolates if he
didn’t guess right. His gallantry was such
that it looked as if he would be bank-
rupt before the Show ended. Down an-
other lane between the pony stables
silhouette portraits done while you wait
by an l American Velasquez were selling
like hot cakes. These two were the sole
representatives of the sideshows, Mr.
Louis Monod having scourged the
world’s fattest woman, the tailed youth
from Borneo and the pin-headed China-
man from the Temple of Agriculture.
Aircraft Accidents
“Minto’s” idea of increasing the crew
of the DCS to include a radio-operator
(B. 22/9/’4B) would not help very much
to increase air safety in bad weather. The
proposed new crew member would only
have the same equipment as that used by
pilots, who, incidentally, are expert radio-
operators, possessing P.M.G. first-class
commercial radio-operator’s tickets.
Actually, a pilot navigating the aircraft
finds the added task of radio-operator
very useful, as he is able to check his
dead-reckoning position by radio with
the minimum of delay. Being at thd
controls and in telephonic communication
with the ground aeradio stations at the
flick of a switch (frequently it is a small
button on the microphone), the pilot has
"This is no time to play hard-to-get, dear !”
that feeling of security and confidence
frequently lacking when there is a radio-
operator.
However, when radio conditions are
bad a crew full of wireless-operators
could not obtain a bearing With the
equipment at present used in Australia.
Radio-aids to navigation for cross-
country flights are confined to two distinct
units in this country—the radio compass
and high - frequency direction - finding
stations. The radio compass, acclaimed
as a revolutionary piece of electronic
apparatus 10 years ago, has outlived its
usefulness. It is subject to error at night
and unsatisfactory during ionospheric dis-
turbances.
The h.-f. d.-f. stations left to the De-
partment of Civil Aviation by the
R.A.A.F., though capable of giving good
bearings and “fixes” over long distances
on frequencies varying from two to eight
megacycles,, are also unreliable during
bad weather. Electrical storms cause dis-
tortion on the cathode-ray oscilloscope,
and make it extremely hard for the
ground operator to give a first-class bear-
ing (accurate to within half a degree).
Australia needs a complete redesigning
of aviation radio aids with greater use of
the very high frequencies (above 30 mega-
cycles). Radio storms are practically un-
heard of at those frequencies, which are
being used successfully in America and
Europe. “Homing” radar beacons should
be erected in every city or town in the
Commonwealth, as they were studded
around the Australian coast during the
war.
Although D.C.A. has made limited re-
search into the very high frequencies, it
has never made a practical Common-
wealth-wide approach to the problem.
“Minto’s” presumption that the pilot
of the crashed DCS did not use his radio
could be wrong. His absence “on the
air” was possibly due to full-time use of
the radio compass which led him miles
off his course to his death. Were the
aircraft fitted with v.h.f. aids that plane
might still be flying.— Waddlin’ Willie
(Vic.).
Kosciusko
Kosciusko and the surrounding
country, including Kiandra, Jindabyne,
Adaminaby, Dalgety, Cooma and, of
course, the Yarrangobilly Caves, could
be made into one of the finest “winter
playgrounds” in the world. At present
it is an exclusive area for the privileged
few because of lack of accommodation ;
more hotels, guest-houses and week-end
cabins are needed so that the ordinary
man can take his family along for a
holiday.
At other times of the year the area
could cater for rod-fishermen, hikers,
mountaineers and families simply seek-
ing rest in ideal surroundings. There are
6000 miles of trout-streams in the
Kosciusko area, including the Snowy,
Thre d b o , Maclaughlan, Umeralla,
Bredbo, Eucumbene and Murrumbidgee
Rivers, as well as many small tributaries.
Some of the streams need restocking,
more and better roads are needed in the
area, and more attention should be given
to opening up the Yarrangobilly Caves.
When Twofold Bay is established as a
deep-sea port there could be a direct
route from Eden to Kosciusko, so that
tourists could leave the boat at Eden and
travel overland, via either the Tanta-
wanglo or Brown Mountain both
splendid scenic routes. W. P. T.
(N.S.W.).
Root of the Matter
A housing official in Victoria is being
sent to Europe to investigate unusual
building methods, with a special eye to
pise and mudbrick. Why go to that
expense when there are dozens of build-
ings within 14 miles of Melbourne built
out of the earth from the foundations?
If the C.S.I.R. wants a test of durability
they have only to look at the remains
of a house built 100 years ago and
recently demolished. The bricks -are still
sound. —C. B. (Vic.). *
Red cedar is not 'the only tree that
doesn’t flourish under monoculture (B.
15/9/’4B). Most trees do best in mixed
plantings. Countries well advanced in
forestry have practically abandoned the
practice of growing stands of one type of
tree, except, of course, when that method
is natural. Rolf Gardiner, writing on
the subject in Harold Massingham’s The
Natural Order, censured the British
Forestry Commission for currently favor-
ing the monocultural system which
countries like Germany, Austria and
Switzerland had already found unsatis-
factory. Our foresters have apparently
followed the British example.—D. An
(N.S.W.).
Chifley was on shaky ground when he
said, disparagingly, that most of the
European settlers in Malaya had gone
there “for profit.” How many “Labor”
politicians have sought election solely to
serve the community? When does a
“Labor” member ever oppose a salary
grab, or a pensions scheme, or, if turned
down by the electors, a Government
sinecure? Nor is the association of
“Labor” politicians with profit-making
enterprises altogether unknown. What
other purpose actuated the connection
of Hamilton, M.L.A., with Metropolitan
Portland Cement, Mulcahy’s pub owner-
ship, Maxie Falstein’s watch-importing
or McKell’s and Downing’s; acquisition
of landed property? —Den (N.S.W.).
I was advised by my doctor to be X-
rayed and given a letter to the
nearest public hospital. There they
wanted my name, Christian name, ad-
dress, occupation, employer, weekly in-
come. Did I own my own home? If
not, how much rent did t pay? I pro-
tested that I didn’t want the X-ray free.
All I wanted was to have it and pay for
it. “Sorry,” said the clerk, “regulations,”
and so the questionnaire went on. Finally
I was told that the X-ray would be done
in a week’s time, and the result avail-
able a week after that. Also, there was
nothing free about it —the standard
charge was 10s. 6d. I told them to keep
it, rang a private radiologist and had the
X-ray and result within 24 hours. —Mac
(N.S.W.).
“Norther” misjudges the New Eng-
land new-State movement when he says
that “stagnation is there, stark and un-
disguised” (B. 15/9/’4B). The new-State.
movement in this State is anything but
dead. Already on the platform of the
Country party the plan has the declared
support of several politicians, including
P. C. Spender, former opponent of new
States. Some 20 shire and municipal
councils in northern N. S. Wales have
also advised the movement of their sup-
port for the campaign. The organisa-
tion itself has appointed an energetic
and capable secretary in T. H. Scholfield,
ex-M.H.R., who, with Ulrich Ellis, of the
Office of Rural Research and Develop-
ment, will shortly visit centres in the new-
State area. —New-Stater (N.S.W.).
"Cavalleria" and
"Pagliacci."
The famous double bill of bucolic
realism and Italian passion prepared by
Mascagni and Leoncavallo is almost a
bit too much for one evening, especially
when it is seiAed up with the intensity
displayed by the company now in occupa-
tion of Melbourne His Majesty’s. Yet they
do it easily, as if grand opera were their
language, which, in case of fact, it is.
Halinka de Tarczynska, the young Mel-
bourne singer trained in the musical
laboratories of the National Theatre
movement, was called on at eight days’
notice to take the exacting part of Nedda
in “Pagliacci” in place of an Italian
prima donna. She turned in a remark-
ably intelligent performance—her voice
is sweet and true, although not powerful
enough for grand opera.
As with “Hamlet,” there is a play
within a play, and it is more difficult
because the principal actors in the real-
life drama of love, jealousy and hate in
the Calabrian village are also the actors
in the harlequin play, which changes
from pretence to deadly earnest until it
is not Pagliacci, the clown, but Canio,
the jealous husband, who is asking threat-
ening questions and preparing to plunge
a real knife instead of a stage dagger into
Columbine’s palpitating bosom.
Miss Tarczynska steered her impas-
sioned way through these complicated
proceedings so adroitly that there were
no awkward emotional or musical
moments between her and Rafael
Lagares, who tore his hair and beat his
breast and sobbed and brayed his feel-
ings in a rich, elastic tenor. As Tonio,
the clown, Mario Basiola looked extra-
ordinarily like George Wallace.
“Cavalleria” was another triumph of
hot-blooded drama and drnate singing.
Germane di Guilio gave Santuzza the
full weight of a majestic person and a
musical bellow which appeared to have
no limits to its compass but could be
tuned, when required, to sweetness.
Ferracuti snarled, stormed and groaned
his way through the part of the faithless
lover and bit the ear of his rival with
realistic relish. The famous Intermezzo
provided the usual grateful lull in the
tempest of emotion. Carmen Mascagni
made an appealing Mama Lucia.
"Faust."
German metaphysics, French music,
the love-story which is all that suryives
of Goethe’s mighty drama and the com-
pany of Italians at present occupying
Melbourne His Majesty’s weren’t alto-
gether a happy combination. Faust’s
voluntary choice of eternal torments,
Marguerite’s seduction, the struggle be-
tween her beliefs and feelings • and her
mental disintegration weren’t any more
convincing than her ascent to Heaven,
though not even Bland Holt himself
could have made that convincing.
The escort of chocolate-box angels
who took flight across the empyrean,
losing height every moment, were only
slightly less comic than the artless super-
natural devices of Mephistopheles Cas-
sinelli. However, after drawing a circle
of Neon lights around him and lighting
, flares in wine-cups he imparted a pleas-
ing touch of realism to Rodolfo Moraro
Faust’s return to his dressing-room via
the infernal regions by giving the gentle-
man’s reluctant head a hearty push
through the trapdoor.
The attempt of Ercole Sormani, of
Milan, to recreate the atmosphere of the
Middle Ages in the village-fair scene
wasn’t any more successful than the
efforts of the Victorian Housing Com-
mission to build Spanish mission, snd it
made one wonder why the Tails bothered
to lug a lot of extremely bad painting all
the way from Milan when their own
George Upward could have done much
better.
On the musical side the opera was
satisfying. The brightness of Faust’s
tenor contrasted well with the black bass
of Cassinelli, whose satanic laugh would
have curdled the milk in a dairy, while
the indifferent acting of the Fortunati
was forgotten when she sang those ravish-
ing duets 'with her seducer. Dora
Minarchi, in an extraordinary auburn
hair-do, sang beautifully as Siebel, and
Ferdinando li Donni baritoned impec-
cably as Marguerite’s brother. Mel-
bourne’s Wilma Whitney was admirable
as Martha.
Italian abandon was carried over into
the dressing with the result that even the
peasants looked like major-generals,
while Faust could have 'figured in a Puss-
in-Boots panto without change of cos-
tume.
Klecki.
Of the two first-Australian-hearing
works piloted by Polish conductor Paul
Klecki with the Sydney Symphony
Orchestra, “Trauermusik,” by the con-
temporary Swiss composer Oboussier,
proved to be a bloodless dirge after a
poem by Schiller. The best that can be
said of it, apart from its soporific quality,
is that a neat balance is maintained
throughout between the various choirs of
the orchestra, with the first and second
violins sharing the best of the mediocre
material. The second work, William
Walton’s Violin Concerto, gives the
soloist an opportunity to display technical
mastery of his instrument and the audi-
ence an opportunity to be bored. Both
took full advantage of the opportunities,
and Ernest liewellyn excelled himself in
the fluency of his bowing and the lyrical
quality of his tone; it is a pity that there
was such an abundance of sound and
fury and too little that was worth bowing.
Strong conducting marked the Brahms’
Symphony No. 2 in D Major. Klecki
achieved a fine repose in the pastoral sim-
plicity of the first movement. The tran-
sition in the Adagio from the stormy
passages in the brasses through the re-
statement in the oboes of the first theme
to the tranquillity leading to the coda, in
which excellent tone-color was lent by
the pizzicato accompaniment, was first-
rate. A sparkle and vivacity were in-
jected into the rustic dance of the third
movement, while the conductor swept the
final allegro to a triumphant conclusion
with vigor and mastery. Klecki obvi-
ously revels in Brahms, and here he was
at his very good best for the night.
One of the highlights of the night’s
playing was the tremendous climax
achieved in the “Egmont” t Overture—it
was a Beethoven fanfare in full orchestra
that would thrill an automaton.
In the thirtieth annual exhibition of
the Twenty Melbourne Painters at Mel-
bourne Athenaeum, most of the members
are repeating themselves or repeating
other painters. John Farmer’s land-
scapes are more individual, and his “Land-
scape near Ballarat” is a sincere piece
of painting. Alma Figuerola has some
blue sea and sunny headland in “Kitty
Miller’s Bay, Phillip Island,” and P. Hurry
has a studio interior which is faithfully
painted. In “Barbara” William Prater
presents a somewhat flat young lady, and
Miss A. M. E. Bale provides a post-
mortem portrait of the late Major-
General Vasey which is curiously subdued
in coloring but lively in expression.

There is nothing commonplace about
Lina Bryan’s display of oils at George’s
Gallery, Melbourne. The golden color of
a wattle or the dark foliage of a plum-
tree attracts her and she dashes it in with
great assurance, though without a great
deal of penetration or much attention to
tonal values. That, however, may not be
her interest, and, judged more or less as
patterns, her paintings are pleasing.

O NE of the ambitions of every housewife is to reign
over a modern all-steel kitchen. It is so nice to come
home to something to be proud of and pleasant to
work in.
Nothing contributes more to contented living than
today’s ideal kitchen. Here is a domain where steel’s
strength, versatility and pleasing appearance is at once
apparent. In the hands of industry steel has brought to
reality the plans of architects and engineers for greater
kitchen effectiveness and beauty.
t
Yes, today’s dream kitchens with their stainless steel
sinks, electric and gas cooking ranges, trouble-free
hot water services, steel-built freezers and refrigerators,
and space-saving steel storage cabinets are far removed
from the days of the hand-turned cooking spit and the
iron pot on the hob.
The use of steel in kitchen furnishings and equipment
provides evidence of the fact that steel can do more jobs
better than any other material.
B.H.P. steel—product of the fusion in the furnaces
at the Newcastle Steel Works of South Australian iron
ore and limestone and New South Wales coal—plays its
part in enabling the Australian housewife to enjoy the
benefits of modern kitchen design.
