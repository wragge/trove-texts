Tales of the Early Days.
No. XVI, (and last)—The Pardon that
never came.
(FOR THE BULLETIN.)
BY PRICE WARUNG
Port Phillip was not yet separated from
New South Wales—and, consequently, Convict
Pierre La Touche was not yet lost sight of by the
high and benign Powers in Sydney,
Those Powers were never so benign as when
they forgot a convict. When they let him slip
out of their ordinardy retentive memories, which
gripped everything about him except his virtues,
they did him the kindest of kindnesses. Oblivion
sometimes brings with it happiness.
But the System declined to be oblivious of
Pierre La Touche’s existence. It assigned him to
Mr. Landon Hughes, of Naluka Tallock, in the
western district of Port Phillip—Fire-eating
Foster Fyans was District Commissioner—and it
was so solicitous respecting him that it required
from botli Mr. Hughes and Captain Fyans an
annual certificate that Convict La Touche was
still in the flesh and handcuffable. The Powers
would not have been satisfied by the simple
assurance that La Touche was not dead. They
would not have slept o’ nights were they not
convinced also that he was conveniently situated
with respect to a suit of fetters and a pair of
manacles.
The truth was that, in the interests of the
Throne, tiro Colonial Powers were themselves
under command to specially watch over the safety
of convict La Touche. It is conceivable they
might have forgotten him and lost sight of him in
tile same Way that a thousand other transports
had passed from their ken had not the exalted
beings who held the keys of Empire dignified La
Touche with a sp cia! minute. “He is not to be
kept in close confinement,” minuted, the Secretary
of State, y but is to bo assigned to some settler in
the interior of superior station, who should, how-
ever, be instructed m the occurrence of any cir-
cumstances ” —the Exalted Being is alone respon-
sible for this elegant preciseness of phrase—“ of a
suspicious and treasonable nature, to bring the
prisoner instantly before the nearest Court, who
shall thereupon take such action as it may consider
necessary.” So the System had to watch him.
And the gods pleased that just as convict La
Touche was becoming a thorn in the side of the
Sydney authorities—inasmuch as for a whole
month’s space they couldn’t determine to whom
he should be assigned—Mr. Landon Hughes, who
had lately taken up land in Western Port Phillip,
should visit Sydney. And Mr. Landon Hughes,
being in want of a “ special ” or educated convict
to serve as tutor and book-keeper, and being him-
self of “superior station” —it was confidentially
stated by the Colonial Secretary that he was the
sdrl of a Royal bigamist—at once consented to
accept La Touche as an assigned man. The
assignment system was in abeyance. But
then over an Act of Council was, of course, the
instruction of the Secretary of State. ’Twas
neither the first time nor the last that a Minister’s
note had set aside a Local Act, for that was the
sort of thing to be expected in the epoch of the
Early Days. The notion was supremely ridiculous
that a Secretary of State for the Colonies had
time to spare for acquainting himself with the.
( details of administration. If he did that h«
would have had no opportunity for gambling al
White’s, or to pursue his liaison with her grace ;
the Duchess of Fraile-Vertu. “Dear Sir R—
once unofficially wrote a prominent Under-Secre-
tary to a college-chum who happened to be pre-
siding oyer the destinies of our Australian colony
at the time. “ I cannot transmit by this packet
the necessary instructions to deal with the matter
of yours No. 45 of this year, because the chief is
perdu. You know his old flame. . . ? He is
with her at. . And, of course, the able and
experienced Under-Secretary could not venture to
interrupt his Minister’s amorous dalliances by
drawing his attention to so bagatellish a business
as a question of a man’s life. That was the
“matter.” Should the man hang? Why not?
Why disturb the holder of the keys of the State
with such a question when he was intent on
amorous conquests ?
Now, Pierre La Touche, in spite of regula-
tions which prevented him from being assigned,
was assigned—shipped off by the schooner Grunt-
ley and in due time delivered to the agents of
Mr. Landon Hughes at Portland, Western Port
Phillip. As he was a chattel, a receipt was given
for his body to the schooner’s skipper. Receipts
were given constantly for bodies—so far as we
know, for “ souls ” never, save in one instance,
to be told hereafter.
* * *
La Touche was the gentlest soul that ever
breathed. In him all the fine qualities of the old
French seignior bloomed in a rich effloresence.
Every woman was to him a Madonna, every child
an expression of supernal innocence. Tall, slight,
refined, broad-browed, with a contour of the face
sharpening to a point that indicated not so much
weakness as a strengtli in repose that would
require an emotional earthquake to disturb it, he
carried in every line of his features, in the calm
penetration of his hazel eye, in his unstudied,
thoughtless freedom of movement, proof that he
was no degenerate scion of a once-powerful race.
It was a marvel to those who knew him in Canada
how he could have sprung immediately from the
superior peasantry. And yet (so the official penal
papers informed the authorities in Sydney) he was
but a peasant of the peasants. Perhaps in some
not distant generation a daughter of one of the
great seigniors of the Beauharnois had wedded a
stalwart son of Acadie, and thus, blending the
yeoman with noble blood, had revived in a later
day the type that might have listened to the song
of Roland as Taileffer chanted it in the ears of
the mailed knights of the Carlovingian epoch.
Clothe La Touche in mail, and no wide stretch of
imagination would have been necessary to have
pictured; him as ringing battle-axe and broad
sword on the cuirass of Saladin. Clothe him in
silken mantle, and doublet, and plumed hat, and
jewelled hose, and he would have been beloved of
ladies of high degree and the song of trou-
badours. Standing on the forty-foot jetty that
the Hentys had run out to berth their
whalers and their produce and stock schooners
from Launceston, he was still the noble, though
his costume was hodden gray and stamped with
the symbol of the slave. Number and prong were
on his garments, and the stained and torn hat
bore a mark that indicated it had once been the
head-gear of a capital offender. His official
description stated him “Farm labourer,” but he
was a gentleman always and everywhere. The
British aristocratic type found numerous repre-
sentatives among the transports, but till Canada,
in her wild burst for freedom in the Thirties,
placed the tools of Papineau and Nelson within
reach of the law of treason, the penal immigration
had included nothing so distinctly gentle as the
Canadians. ‘We cannot find their representatives
to-day. Of the three contingents of Canadian
convicts there are, so far as we can ascertain, no
survivors in Australia, because when amnesty
came seignior and dependent alike pined for their
native provinces, thirsted after the sound of the
rapids, and hungered for the balsamed breath of
the pines by the portages, and returned.
Several stayed, it is true, but freedom had come
to them in another form. Among these latter was
La Touche.
* * *
He invited insult by reason of the very
gentleness that was manifested in his manner and
speech, but he resented it by a calm strength
of disdain that was more irritating to the
affronter than contemptuous retort or emphatic
blow, and it was singular how the lower-class
convicts who had voyaged with him from Sydney
to Portland had, after venting their own vulgarity
upon him, been so conquered by his magnanimity
of self-restraint as to stand between him and
insult from the schooner hands and the jetty-men.
Crossing the _ gang-plank, and carrying his
“duds ” with him, a jetty-hand, one of Henty’s
assigned servants, gave the plank a push with his
foot. La Touche would have fallen, had not
another transport, follovying him in his passage
from the hold, caught him, and by an unusual
exercise of strength saved him from a tumble, and
possibly an immersion in the sea. As soon as the
old man, still quivering with the shock, once
reached the jetty, the fellow who had helped him,
and who had himself led an attack of coarse words
and ruder gestures upon the Canadian at the
beginning of the voyage, turned and struck the
jetty-hand.
“Don’t yer twig a swell w’en you see him.
This’ll larn yer manners, ol’ codger !” And a
fight was only stopped by Frank Henty,* then, as
ever, as brave as he was courteous, thrusting him-
self between the two fellows. Unfortunately,
when La Touche noticed this incident, he
expressed his thanks to Henty with an accuracy
and refinement of phrase that surprised young
Frank, for he took off his cap, forgetting, in the
impulse of the moment, that the man whom he
saluted was a convict.
“Mister Frank, sir, Mr. Frank !” cried one of
the station-overseers who had come down to the
schooner-side to receive the Merino Downs detach-
ment of assigned hands, “Don’t you see he’s a
lag?”
The red blood rushed to La Touche’s face as he
checked himself in the bow with which he was
unconsciously returning young Henty’s salutation.
He substituted for it a touch of his hat and a few
words, “ I thank you,” he said to the overseer,
“ for reminding me of—what I am. But, to you,
sir,’’ turning to Henty, “a myriad thanks for
reminding me of what I was.”
And then he ranged himself with the other
convicts the schooner had disembarked, who were
waiting to be claimed with the rest of her cargo.
* * *
This was the manner of the arrival of La
Touche in Portland—his departure from it took
place the day after. One of Mr. Landon Hughes’
bullock-drays was in Portland for stores, and, of
course, that commodity and chattel, La Touche,
was fastened up with other goods by the grazier’s
agent. Literally fastened, we say, inasmuch
as the bull-puncher being compelled in due rou-
tine to give a receipt to the agent for La Touche’s
body, declined to be responsible for a transport’s
safety unless he was secured to the waggon.
“No bolter for me !” he said, “ an’ I’m
told as this cove’s a swell. I ain’t no faith in
swells !” And the agent, thinking it was only a
chattel and not an atom of refined humanity with
which he had to deal, allowed the brutal, tur-
bulent fellow to have his way. A superannuated
bullock-whip tied convict La Touche, the descen-
dant of nobles, to the dray. The “fall,” a single
strip of hide, was wound round his waist; a
length of yarn fastened his hands behind him ; the
belly” of the whip was gathered round a staple,
and so, twelve feet behind the dray, convict La
louche went out of Portland. As the bullocky
was turning the track leading to what is now the
lort Fairy-road, La Touche turned to look at the
sea. The whole of his high-strung nature went
out in tnat last lingering glance. He did not
know it was his last. That was perhaps the
blessedness of it; or, perhaps, that was the horror
of it.
Frank Henty, striding after the dray with an
undefined desire in his heart to help the old man,
somehow caught the glance. He had gone up
half thinking that he would present the convict
with a dollar or two, or, what was the same thing,
“ orders on Henty’s.” But when he reached the
dray, he dared not offer the paper to La Touche.
He had seen his face. To the bullocky, however,
he was less delicately reticent, and, in exchange
for Henty’s orders, he bought the old man’s release
from the galling thraldom to the dray. Nor did
the old man suspect why the knot was so soon
undone.
* * *
The homestead of Langdon Hughes was
40 miles distant from Portland, and was situated
on the Hopkins. It nestled at the foot of low
hills, and faced a sinuous reach of the river, from
a clearing, where once a forest of acacia fringed
the banks by the ford. Across the ford was the
main approach to the house. On the third day
after leaving Portland, the bullock-puncher, who
had been a Torquemada in miniature to the un-
fortunate patriot of the Canadas, hauled up his
team on the farther bank from the house. A
little girl, still on the line which margins infancy
and almost imperceptibly demarcates it from
youth, ran down to the bank on the opposite side
of the stream. The cracking of the monster whip,
and the adjectival eloquence of the bullocky, had
aroused the attention of the household, and the
quick ears of the child being the first to distin-
guish the sounds which heralded the approaching
dray over the noise of the rumbling current of the
river, she was the first to welcome La Touche.
Not, of course, that the System provided for the
welcoming of convicts on reaching the homes of
their assigned masters—not at all. But children
those buds of Paradise blown by zephyrs to
bless the earth—have not invariably a respect for
rule and a regard for regulation. Little Alice
Hughes was doing a distinctly improper thing in
rushing eagerly across the uneven stones which
formed the foot-way of the ford, and holding out
one tiny hand, while tendering him with the other
a small bunch of wild flowers, “Youth’ teacher
isn’th you?” she lisped.
Vv hat were La Touche’s thoughts before she had
run up to him, no one can say, but certainly his
treatment from Landon Hughes himself in Syd-
ney, and from Landon Hughes’ agent in Port-
land, had not prepared him for so felicitous a
reception. The childish accents touched the well-

eccentricities of the System which placed him—a
prisoner of State—under the control of an illite-
rate and brutal “bullocky,” he would have fol-
lowed her, had not the artist in blasphemy and
beast-punching sworn coarsely at him to hold his
steps.
“ I ain’t got no receipt for ye yet, my swell
lag, an’ yer ain’t a-goin’ out o’ my sight till I
gets one. Th’ * cove ’ ken do wot he likes wid yer
then—he ken take yer in the front door and put
yer in th’ drorin’-room an’ he choose —but wi’ me
yer go till I gets a receipt for yer body ! ”
“Come on—come ’long!” said the child, “I’ll
rayth you over ! ” She turned and invited him
by her winsomeness of look and movement to
accept her challenge, but he stood as one be-
numbed. This man who had led a company of
patriots, and who was a prisoner of State, and
about whom the Privy Councillors of England were
even then agitating themselves, stood mute—
obedient —paralysed—at the order of the pettiest
of bush tyrants. The child did not understand
it—nor, we may as well confess, can we—but,
then, there are lots of things about the System not
perfectly understandable now-a-days.
“Come’long, come ’long,” repeated the child.
“ You’th to come to the ’chool-room. Prith’ner
Jim—dith you know prith’ner Jim ? ” Then she
looked in his face, and he had to find words for an
answer. “No,” he said. “No —who was he?”
“Prith’ner Jim —Oh ’e teached me, and, oh,
wath’nt it funny ? We lotht Prith’ner Jim—he
ran away to the black people, cauth Pa whipped
him. You won’t run away, wil’loo, if Pa whipth
’oo?” The inquiry cut him like the stroke of a
lash itself. “No,” he said; “but your Pa will
not whip me ”
“ Oh yeth he will—Pa whipth everybothy ! ”
* * *
The child crossed the ford somewhat dis-
appointed at not having the opportunity of show-
ing to her new preceptor the school-room which
had so charmed Prisoner Jim, for that was the
purport of the communication she had desired to
make to La Touche, but which she had broken off
to wound him with her innocent reference to her
father’s propensity for flogging. The convict,
however, was to know the school-room soon
enough.
For the bullocky introduced him ten minutes
later to the Overseer in charge during Mr. Landon
Hughes’ absence. “ ’Ere’s the new patter slinger,
Mister Trench. Give us your fist for him, sir.”
“ Right, Sam, as soon as I’ve ’dentified him.
Go into that room there, you chap—that long
lean-to by the sheoaks—and strip.”
“Strip, sir ? ”
“ Yes, a-’course ! I’ve heard of you.”
The overseer’s voice softened from its official
harshness. “Mr. Hughes wrote by last schooner
he’d been given a state prisoner, an’ special care
was to be taken.”
“ But, pardon me - why should I strip? These
clothes are all I have ! ” Under caution, he spoke
—as though he suffered inwardly.
“Well”— the steadfast look of the convict
confused the overseer who had been accustomed to
“assignments” of a different brand. “I must
know your marks—‘every pimple of you’; the
master says.”
“ I shall not run away ! ”
“ The chap before you did.”
“ I give you my parole—my word ! ”
A convict’s word ! The overseer, originally one
of Henty’s hands, imported to Launceston from a
Kentish farm-steading, smiled derisively—for a
moment. Then he rose superior to the station
traditions, and said: “I’ll trust you, Go into
that room—into the school-room, but you needn’t
strip.”
The Overseer looked after the tall figure as it
stepped towards the lean-to; was then surprised
—and yet not surprised when he came to think
over the matter later—to notice the figure pausing,
revolving on its heel and returning.
“One word, Monsieur.”
“That’s French, isn’t it? Mr. Hughes says
you are not to be allowed to speak in French ?”
La Touche smiled. “Eh! I beg pardon—l
did not know. But I will withdraw my parole—
my word—if .”
“ Why ? Do you mean as you will escape ?”
“Yes—if, sir, I am beaten —whipped, I will
run away then if I can !”
“If we flog you? Oh, I see! Well, you’re a
straight cove, anyhow. An’ if you’re always as
straight”—the figure drew itself up—“l don’t
mean as you won’t be—you oughtn’t to fear a
flogging here !”
“I never lie —therefore I tell you what I shall
do. I tell you now because I know you are good
and kind to me as you do not insist upon stri—
upon the searching of me. I shall not be whipped
—no one will whip me.” He paused to correct
his grammar. In his excitement he slipped into
unconsciousness of our idiom. “No one shall whip
me—and live ! I will murder who whips me, and
then I will go away to the black people. I have
led Indians —I will lead them !”
Theoverseer’s first impulse was to laugh outright,
the notion of leading blacks to battle was so ludi-
crous. The earnestness of the transport’s manner,
however, was so apparent, and the intense bitter-
ness of his hate for the degrading lash so vibrant
in his speech, that he restrained his merriment.
The past of the convict, a survival of the Middle
Ages, confronted the raw colonist in this patch of
newly-settled country, and impressed him.
“Well,” he said, “ there’s no beating about the
bush with you. And as far as I’m concerned, you
need never fear being flogged. As to the master,
I can’t say. You see, he’s a high and mighty sort,
is Mr. Hughes—rules everything, even the missus
and me, with an iron hand when he’s here, an’—
p’r’aps I oughtn’t to say it, but you’re different
tram the others we’ve had an’ I can trust you—he
believes in the cat for everything.”
“ That was what the little girl said.”
“ Oh, ’ave you seen missie? An’ she said so?”
“ She said Mr. Hughes ”
“Call him ‘Master!’ That’s a nile o’ the
station ! He’d flog you for not saying it!”
“I will call no man master!” replied the
Canadian, foolish and short-sighted in his pride.
“ Now ! ”
“Then, God help you, if he speaks to you when
he comes. “ It’ll be master or the cat.”
“It will be the cat then.” And bowing, not
thinking that he owed something to the magnani-
mity of the Overseer for overlooking the indirect
disregard of the System’s regulations shown by
his substitution of a bow for a salute, he went to
the school-room.

Roughly and hastily constructed bark

locally-cut timber was unseasoned, an attempt
had yet been made to impart to the interior a
Woi.kk’s Schnapps may be relied upon in all
seasons as the purest and best of liquors.
pleasing aspect. A map of the world, a few crude
drawings initialled “J.”—probably the work of
“Prith’ner Jim” —and a pair of small globes
formed the educative appliances, but some one,
most likely the child’s mother, had, with natural
taste, arranged specimens of foliage and some
blacks’ weapons, so as to relieve the bareness of
the department. Curiously contrasting, however,
with the softening influences of the decorations
were the heavy bolt and padlock on the door.
Instinctively Transport La Touche knew the
school-room was his living-room as well. And
his prison.
His prison, but before long his home. Mrs.
Hughes was one of those delicately nurtured
women who, the very salt of the earth, seemed to
waste existence on the dreariness of the bush.
And the child took after her and not after the
father.
Between them, they made his life easy and
bright till the husband and father came home.
Mr. Hughes was detained longer than he expected
by the gaieties of Sydney. Colonel Barney’s
amateur theatrical troupe was in splendid form—
and his tutor and book-keeper had almost for-
gotten the risks contingent on “master’s” arrival.
The assigned hands took their cue from the mis-
tress and overseer Trench, and the latter had
not seen reason to alter the treatment with
which he had received La Touche. So the
transport felt that his lines had fallen in pleasant
places, and had sent an oral message to that
effect to Frank Henty, who had enquired from
the bullockies respecting him. The System, he
thought, improved upon acquaintance.
* * #
However, the son of a Very Great Person-
age returned to his principality, three months after
La Touche, and the bush, which was breathing
healing music to La Touche’s wounded nature,
became sudden discord.
“Fa’ver,” said his little daughter to Hughes
one day shortly after his return, “you haven’t
been to the schoolroom. Teaoherth drawingth
isth so p’etty.” La Touche had sketched for the
child with coloured crayons first some native
flowers, and then her portrait, and the girl,
thinking of them, became eager to exhibit them to
her father—who, son of a Very Great Personage
though he was, was not wholly blind to the
winsomeness of childhood. He promised her to
visit the room.
She ran off to tell La Touche of the impending
honor.
Mr. Landon Hughes entered the, lean-to.
Convict La Touche was standing by the table
which served as school-desk, and, as his master
entered, bowed. Mrs. Hughes had always
accepted the bow in lieu of the salute; so, too,
the overseer. Mr. Landon Hughes was, however,
more faithful to the spirit and the letter of the
System, as befitted the dignity of his magistracy.
“S’lute,” he said, “Don’t you know your duty
yet, pris’ner?”
La Touche flushed and obeyed with a careful:
“Pardon, Monsieur.”
“What’s that? I am ‘master’ here —I’m
Monsieur only to gentleman.”
The moment of ordeal had come—but passed ;
the child intervening as with charming haste she
drew her father towards where, over the end wall,
her portrait hung. “Come here, fav’er, come
here, an’ see my picture.”
The father, looking up, saw a sketch of his child
done with no inconsiderable degree of artistic
skill. Standing one night on the verandah of the
homestead, La Touche had seen the child, dressed
for her sleeping cot, at her mother’s knee. He
carried the vision away with him and had trans-
ferred it later to paper with the child herself as
model. Beneath the drawing he had inscribed
the legend, “ Dieu M’ en Garde !”
The father looked at the drawing and was
pleased. He looked at the inscription; and was
displeased.
The abominable treason !—to introduce French
into a magistrate’s homestead —French, the lan-
guage of traitors, of the men who ought to have
been drawn, hanged, and quartered ! He turned
on his heel, and spoke sternly to the assigned
man. “ How dare you, pris’ner, disobey the
special regulation made in your case—you’re pro-
hibited, did you not know, from using the French
language under all circumstances?”
La Touche, paling at the tone of insult, as he
had before flushed, replied with respect, “Sir!”
he said, “ I am not conscious of offence —the
drawing of the child —’tis but appropriate to the
subject—a child’s prayer. And Madame was
pleased .”
“Madame—Sir,” retorted Hughes. “I make
my people say Mistress and Master. Even I make
my free people say that to whom I pay wages, and
I don’t intend to let you be any exception to this
rule. ” La Touche remained silent.
“Why,” went on Hughes, “did you use
French ?”
“ I see that therein I was in fault, sir.”
“Master, man, Master! That is the rule of
this estate.”
La Touche held his tongue.
“ Repeat your answer.”
“ I see, sir .”
“ Master, I say, Master !”
“ I will say ‘ Master ’ to no man !” That
improvement upon acquaintance which the System
had exhibited was not genuine after all.
For convict La Touche was ordered a dozen
then and there. The regulation prohibiting
magistrates from flogging their own hands in
irregularly-constituted courts had been in force
several years. But 800 miles from the seat of
Government there was some excuse for its being
forgotten. Anyhow, Mr. Landon Hughes forgot
it. And ordered the punishment.
# * #
During the colloquy which had so un-
pleasant a termination, the child had stood by
impatient and large-eyed. She did not under-
stand all that passed. But the procession to the
flogging-tree—the bringing-out of the cat which
hung in the stables—the calling from his work in
the home-paddock of another assigned man : these
she understood ; memorised them ; never to forget
them ; to tell us fifty years afterwards.
“ Mamma, mamma !” she ran from the school-
room to her mother’s parlour, crying out that her
father was about “to whip teacher.” Mrs.
Hughes had on former occasions interposed
between her husband and an intended victim un-
availingly. Her ill-success then would have with-
held her from interference now, had she not been
convinced that La Touche was a man of gentle
feelings and instincts. She remembered, too, what
Overseer Trench had repeated to her, and realised
that to flog the convict meant to drive him to
desperation. She went out to the group by the
flogging-tree.
“ Landon,” she said ; “Landon—one moment,
dear !”
He turned, remonstrating petulantly with her
for her presence there. “You will interfere in
these matters,” he said. “Please go inside !"
“ I shall not detain you more than a moment,
dear. Please come.”
He followed her into the house, resolved, once
for all, to take care that neither now nor at any
future time should her objection to the lash con-
trol “justice.”
Once inside, Mrs. Hughes told her husband of
Ha Touche’s threat to the overseer. Hughes
laughed. “ I think I’ll give him another dozen
for that.”
“ Oh, Landon, Landon, can you not see the
man is a gentleman ?”
“Gentleman!” he laughed. “But I will not
have the station rules disobeyed.”
“But, dear, this once ” the child here ran
in, in tears. Too young to grasp the whole
significance of the punishment, she had seen
something of the suffering and the pain, and
“ Teacher ” had won the faithful, unreasoning
love of her tender nature. “ You won’t beat
teacher, fav’er?” she pleaded.
But Hughes brushed wife and child aside, and
went out —perhaps with a view of carrying out his
order, perhaps not.
• * *
Just then the halloo of a horseman came
from the other side of the creek. It was the boy
who had been sent in to Portland for the mail
returning.
With the hunger for news that characterises
every denizen of the bush, Hughes waited till the
boy brought the bag across. What matter if he
extended the humiliation of La Touche? He
must have some idea at first of the nature of his
correspondence.
The first letter he opened was one from the
Colonial Secretary, Sydney, and informed him
that “Home” despatches had been received
which stated that, pending the final decision of
the Privy Council on the question remitted to it
concerning the legality of the sentence under
which the Canadian rebels had been transported
to New South Wales, that provisional amnesty
had been granted to La Touche and his com-
patriots. “But,” went on the despatch, “the
transport named in the margin (that was La
Touche) is not to be permitted to leave your em-
ploy till the Secretary of State’s formal pardon
has been received.”
Once, and twice, and thrice, did Hughes read
this. Perhaps— he was dubious—punishment by
the lash might be risky under the circumstances.
The man was educated—was before the Privy
Council—was a prisoner of State —the order might
come for final release at any time; so, while
cursing the officials that put him to the bother
and expense of bringing this assigned fellow all
the way from Sydney, he still thought it best to
act a merciful part. “Punishment postponed!”
he growled, and went inside to finish the perusal
of his correspondence.
* # *
The postponed penalty was never inflicted.
Nor was “Master” insisted on again. To La
Touche’s surprise, and Mrs. Hughes’ delight,
Hughes, on the contrary, showed the convict
something of external consideration, but of the
amnesty and the possibility of a pardon he said
nothing. Neither did he tell his wife of that
despatch.
He had remitted the penalty, but nevertheless
he punished the transport —consciously and of in-
tent, punished him. He had determined to say
nothing of the pardon.
Many another fine Australian gentleman of the
Early Days acted similarly.
• « #
Crave for liberty as La Touche might,
pray for it as he did, though the restraints upon
him became slighter and more and more silken as
the girl grew up and became fonder of him, the
pardon never came. So Hughes said. And La
Touche, knowing the System was often forgetful,
believed him.
Enfranchisement came, however, in the year of
the gold discovery. Free hand and assigned hand
alike had started for the gold-diggings, till the 25
or 30 men whom the station-work had kept busy
became two —La Touche and one other.
La Touche gave up his teaching and bookkeep-
ing for such rougher work as he was equal to. One
day in December, a hot and broiling day, that
recalled the grim horrors of that awful Thursday
of the previous February, he had ridden towards
the eastern boundary of the run. He did not
return at nightfall, and Hughes at last thought
that he, too, had been smitten by the gold-fever
and had gone to the diggings. Only Mrs. Hughes
and the girl knew better. For two days he was
absent, and then the girl, who knew her way like
a tracker through bush and scrub and over plain
and creek, found him a-babbling, not of green
fields, but of forests and rivers, rapids and por-
tages, of L’Acadie and the seigniorv of Beau-
harnois, and of the fatal attack upon the church
at Odell Town when he was captured. And of
one other thing he babbled ; of the pardon that had
never come—to him.
In the delirium caused by sunstroke, he won-
dered why he had been forgotten. England was
not wont to treat her political prisoners with such
utter forgetfulness—she amnestied those she did
not hang—yet she had forgotten him. And in
the babbling which told the girl of the great desire
of his heart after freedom, he passed away. The
girl wept because he did not recognise her.
* # #
Yet the pardon had come, and with it an
extract from the Privy Council’s decision in his
favour, and the girl found both when, a grown
woman, in 1860, she perused her dead father’s
papers. She knew then when the pardon had
come, and wept again—over her teacher’s loss
and her father’s shame.

SATURDAY, DECEMBER 24, 1892,
Insidious Imperialism.
The Australian people, while acclaiming
the idea of National Federation, had the
singular foresight to disclaim at the same
time, by innumerable declarations, Imperial
Federation. They applauded The first steps
as movements towards National Federation ;
they recoil from the steps it is now sought
to precipitate them into, because they begin
to apprehend that the Draft Bill of the Con-
vention embodies Imperial Federation ! The
cloven hoof can be detected readily enough,
once attention is directed to the right place.
Its existence has been concealed by a drapery
of fine phrases of a strongly democratic
pattern. The character of the draft consti-
tution is artfully disguised by its name—
“ The Constitution of the Commonwealth.”
This is a style strongly suggestive of liberty
and even of republicanism. Sir Henry
Parkes habitually delivers himself of sound-
ing sentences carrying a flavour of separatism.
He prates of an Australian nation, taking an
equal place among the nations of the world,
sending its ambassadors to every court, and
hoisting a flag of its own. Not one of these
suggestive sayings but is absolutely and
diametrically belied by the actual provisions
and tendencies of the proposed Constitution.
* # «
The Australian “colonies” are depen-
dencies now. Federated in accordance with
the Convention Bill, their dependent condi-
tion would be confirmed, accentuated, and
even aggravated. The powers allotted to the
Governor-General would be, by virtue of
various clauses of the Bill, collateral with
those which define his authority, such as no
Governor of an Australian province has ever
been vested with. Appointed by the Crown,
ho will be entitled to exercise, subject to the
provisions of this Constitution, “ such powers
and functions as the Queen may think fit to
assign to him.” The suggestion of limita-
tion conveyed in the phrase, “ subject to the
provisions of this Constitution is most
misleading. In reality, the provi ■ us of the
Constitution limit the powers of t no Gover-
nor not at all, save that ho cannot enact
laws. But in executive functions he will be
effectively autocratic. Even in those cases
in which his executive authority is ostensibly
limited by the concurrence of the Executive
Council being required, such apparent check
is altogether delusive. The members of the
Executive Council are to be chosen by the
Governor himself, and to hold office during
his pleasure. They need not be members of
either house of the Federal Parliament.
They need not be Australians. The Gover-
nor may take the officers out of a British
man-of-war just arrived and make them his
Executive Council, He could manufacture
an Executive Council out of the flunkeys
who wait on him at table or stand behind his
carriage. Lest any reader consider that
such a provision is too monstrous to be
credible, we quote the clause of the draft
bill
Chap, ii,, sec. 2; There shall he a Council to aid and
advise the Governor-General in the Government of the
Commonwealth, and such Council shall be styled the
Federal Executive Council; and the persons who are to
be members of the Council shall be from time to time
chosen and summoned by the Governor-General and
sworn as Executive Councillors, and shall hold office
during his pleasure.
• * *
An attempt has been made to huddle out
of sight the obvious Imperialistic intention
of these traitorous provisions by the poor
plea that in pursuance of the established
course of constitutional procedure, no Vice-
roy would attempt to exert the immense
powers so conferred upon him. But the
uusoundness of such extenuation, and either
the insincerity or the dulness of those who
urge it, can be perceived after a moment’s
reflection. The Sovereign of Great Britain
who retains quite as large nominal powers,
never during late reigns has attempted or
would venture to exert them. But the power
of the Sovereign and her technically constitu-
tional prerogatives are effectually held in
check and restrained by the power of the
Commons and people of Britain. That is
to say, there is a real physical strength more
than balancing the influence of the Crown.
Wei’e the Sovereign to insist on using the
full powers with which the Crown is yet
invested, the result would be insurrection
and revolution. There is a real balance and
a real check. But with respect to the
technical powers of the Crown, by its Repre-
sentative, in relation to the people of
Australia, there is no such balance and no
such check.
* * *
The situation which requires to be pro-
vided against is the possible antagonism of
Imperial as against Australian interests.
In such case the Crown would really
have the support of the people of
England, and the Governor - General
would be the exponent and the instrument
of the will of the Crown and the Commons
of Great Britain—in fact, of the whole
might of the Mother Country. Against this
the concentrated repugnance of the Austra-
lian people would probably be as naught.
The Governor-General could, without anxiety
and without straining the written constitu-
tion concocted by the Federation Convention,
exert all the powers with which that Consti-
tution arms him. With an Executive
Council, imported from England, holding all
Ministerial positions and so directing all the
machinery of the Federation, he could over-
ride the will of the Parliament and of the
nation, and govern in accordance with the
laws, but also, as to executive acts, in defer-
ence to such instructions as he might receive
from his English masters. Even the consti-
tutional safeguard of witholding supplies
would be unavailable to the Australians, for
as an industrial people they tax themselves
mainly for their own convenience and
requirements. It would be no embarrass-
ment to an English Governor-General were
the Federal Legislature to refuse moneys to
maintain the public service and the public
works. The very sums which they might
ivish to withhold would be beyond their
reach, because the salaries of the Governor-
General and of his Ministers are provided
for in the draft constitution itself, and would
be, consequently, exempt fromannual votings.
Imperial Federation peeps out from a score
of lurking-places in the Draft Bill of the
Convention, and to give a vote approving of
the main principles of that bill, as the Legis-
lature is now invited to do, would be to seal
with approbation a document which signs
away all the essentials of that national
liberty which it is the duty of every patriotic
Australian to guard.
# * #
There is an affectation now of pretending
to regard the Convention Bill as a sort of
Federation Bible—an inspired work, for
which no substitute could be provided. All
who refuse to receive this precious piece of
imposture as divine are to be branded as
heretics and schismatics. Just as the
Catholic Church denounces as beyond the
pale of Christianity all who refuse to accept
its particular dogmas, so the high priests of
the Convention pretend to excommunicate
as enemies to Federation everyone who
objects to bow the knee before their idol—
the Bill of the Convention. Unless a man
be a Federationist of the Draft Bill
sect, he is an enemy to Federation.
This is sheer impertinence and gross
audacity. It is full time that the mask
of patriotism bo pulled from the faces
of the vain fools or plotting conspirators who
strive to impose subjection upon the people
of Australia under the guise of conferring on
them national status. The clear duty of
true National Australians is to repudiate the
Convention Bill, and to indicate how very
different a measure will be that which they
are willing to accept as a preservative of
Australian liberties, and a key to open the
way to liberties yet more extended.
Government by Contradiction —Again!
The closing year leaves, so far as concerns the
five Parliaments of Australia, much the same
record as many profitless years which have gone
before. It is a record of wasted declamation,
broken hopes, lost aspirations, unkept promises,
riot, recrimination, party struggles as confused
as the battles of the kites and the crows; cease-
less debates about nothing, the weary splitting
of useless straws, the aimless shuffling of
dishonest politicians into and out of office, the
constant grabbing after Government billets and
salaries, the perennial announcement by every
party that the country will be lost if the other
party is in office, and that the country will be
saved if it is in office itself, the perpetual
formation of new cliques, which appear and
vanish again like bubbles on the sea, ipotions for
adjournment, motions of want of confidence —
everything, in fact, except actual business.
There is practically nothing to show as the
work of ten Houses of Parliament, save the
frantic struggles of every faction to harry the
other faction away from the national hog-trough,
where it is the joy and pride of the pig in office to
gorgehimself with his front hoofs in the swill; and
the complaints of the hog at the trough about
therude manner in which he is shoved by the hog
behind. The latest conflict between these two
specimens of gluttony has arisen in New South
Wales, where the Opposition animal has moved,
for the third time, or thereabouts, this year, that
it is his turn to get his forward extremities in
the swill, and as there is now little more than a
week remaining until the barren year comes to
a close, this will probably be the last motion of
the kind during 1892, But though this is
probable, it is by no means certain. Seldom
does a week pass without some politician in
some of the Australias rising to move the old,
dry-as-dust resolution, “that this Government
does not possess the confidence of the country.”
# # •
Cabinet-wrecking, or attempted Cabinet-
wrecking, is an established profession in Aus-
tralia nowadays. It is a branch of politics by
itself, and is generally followed by cranks with
no vestige of constructive ability, no originality,
no administrative capacity, and no other
capacity that is visible to the naked eye,
men who have never drafted one useful measure,
or suggested one solitary reform, or contributed
one idea of the slightest value to the aggregate
wisdom of the nation. Bryan O’Loghlen, the
bald devastator of Victorian politics —the
chaotic Broguey Man whose only inspiration is
that the country should live on “ postherity ”
—is probably the most conspicuous professor of
this profitless art south of the equator. His
no-confidence motions are never, or hardly ever,
carried, but he moves them with the painful
regularity of the old whim-horse that walks in
the same well-worn groove till death inter-
venes. G. H. Reid, of New South Wales,
though a comparatively new exponent of this
branch of the great mystery of uselessness,
probably ranks next to him as a public obstruc-
tion ; and the other provinces have also their
wreckers Of more or less note. It requires no
intelligence to be a Cabinet-wrecker ; all that
is necessary is to rise and state in a wooden
voice, and at frequent intervals, “ that this
Government does not possess the confidence of
the country,” and then there begins an un-
bounded flow of declamation that is like the
letting in of many dirty waters. When the
professional no-confidence man is not on the job
other varieties of obstructionists take his place.
There is the professional individual who nightly
moves the adjournment of the House in order
that he may babble in a solemn monotone about
things in general, from the cholera in Europe
down to the forfeiture of a selection in the
back-blocks ten years previously. There is
the individual who habitually rises to
demand a select committee to inquire
into everything, with power to send for every-
body. There is the individual—loo of him—
who wants to ask a separate question—or 12
separate questions—every night; and the one
who always wants the House counted ; and the
one who perpetually moves that the chairman
should report progress ; and the other one who
“ objects ” to everything and divides the House
on every possible opportunity. And the only
night when these assorted obstructions are not
on hand the wrecker generally rises and booms
out once more his old formula, “ That this
Government does not possess the confidence of
the country.” Whereupon, according to pre-
cedent, all business must cease until all the
time-worn speeches have been delivered over
again, and the same old result has been arrived
at by the same circuitous method once more,
* * *
All these troubles are essential features in the
absurd system of Party Government. In every
Parliament conducted under this stupid and
nefarious system the only object of the Opposi-
tion is to shunt the Cabinet out of office. The
easiest way to effect this purpose is to demon-
strate that the Cabinet is absolutely useless
and powerless, and thereby to reduce the
nation to that state of utter disgust in which
any change seems to be a change for the better ;
therefore, it is the policy of the Opposi-
tion to block every separate item of business
day and night, from the beginning of
the year to the end. Then when the session
closes in utter barrenness it is the business of
the Opposition to stump the country with
declamations about the impotence of the Minis-
try which has promised so much and accom-
plished so very little, and to point to the results
of its own obstructive tactics as proof that the
Government is effete and discredited, and that
the country will presently be lost unless it is
removed from office. The motions for adjourn-
ment, the motions for select committees, the
motions that the House be counted, and that
the Chairman should “report progress,” the
want-of-confidence motions, the questions, the
objections to formal motions, three-fourths of
the debates, the personal explanations, the
amendments, the points of order—nearly all of
them have but one object: to prevent the
Government doing anything in order that it
may become discredited because it failed to do
anything. Even the strongest Australian
Government never effects any valuable reform
nowadays except by long years of patient
effort; a weak Government, or one that is only
moderately strong, never effects anything of
value at all. The only time when the eternal
obstruction breaks down is when some gigantic
swindle—such as the Queensland Land-Grant
Railway Bill —is being put through, and there
is enough plunder to give everybody of conse-
quence a share. An honest measure which has
no plunder attached to it is invariably obstructed
to the uttermost, and the more valuable it is
the more carefully it is blocked at every stage,
because the greater is the unpopularity incurred
by the Government through its failure.
* • *
The want-of-confidence motion which was
introduced the other day in the New South
Wales Assembly differs in no appreciable extent
from the last fifty or sixty similar motions
which have arisen in the various Parliaments of
Australia. It was brought forward, as such
motions almost always are, just when the
Government, despite all other obstacles, was in
danger of accomplishing some useful purpose
whereby it might have gained a certain amount
of credit, and made its position more secure,
and thus kept the Parkes-Reid faction from
getting its turn at the public hog trough as
soon as it expected. There was nothing to be
lost by it, so far as the Foreign-trade party was
concerned, and there was a possibility that
much, in the shape of office and salary,
would be gained. If the attempt succeeded,
the Electoral Bill, the Local Government Bill,
and the Federation Bill would be practically lost
in the confusion, and then the new Foreign-trade
Cabinet would re-introduce these measures as
its own, and attempt to make its billet and re-
election sure by passing them and thus earning
the national gratitude, which gratitude would
otherwise have been wasted on its rivals. If
the attempt did not succeed there was always
a chance that the inevitable loss of time might
lead to some or all of the bills in question being
left unfinished at the end of the session, which
fact would be held up on the pitchfork of
derision as proof of the utter inefficiency of the
Dibbs Cabinet. There was not the remotest
semblance of regard for the public welfare in
the whole miserable business ; it does not pay
to have any regard for the public welfare under
the hideous system of Party Government.
# # *
There is no possible reason to believe that the
evil, bad as it undoubtedly is, has reached
its worst or anything resembling its worst.
Although, thanks to the obstruction and riot
which now pass for statesmanship, such impor-
tant measures as the N.S.W. Local Govern-
ment Bill may hang tire for a quarter of a century
(justas thatbillhasalready hung fire for a quarter
of a century), yet every Cabinet, up to date, has
managed at least to pass one or two new laws,
or to tinker one or two old ones, merely as a
proof of its existence, and has contrived to get
its Estimates put through—generally at the fag
end of the session when it was too late for any
useful criticism. But if the present system
continues it is quite within the bounds of possi-
bility that a time may come when even this will
be found practically impossible—when the Legis-
lature will get down to first principles, and the
process of disintegration will be complete, and
nothing will remain but confusion and blank
anarchy. The system of Party Government
has infinite possibilities of evil and not one
beneficial element. If it lasts representative
government is doomed. It is the road to chaos,
and chaos is the road to .despotism. The only
visible remedy is that which The Bulletin has
so often advocated—the election of Ministers
for a fixed term (say three years) by direct vote
of the House, and altogether irrespective of
parties. The triennial scramble for office might
be bad enough, but at least it would be better
than the daily scramble which prevails at
present. The difference between the two
systems is that between the United States Presi-
dential election, which eventuates every
four years, and a Presidential election which
keeps going on day and night for ever and ever
without amen. The one undoubtedly has its
disadvantages ; the other is built entirely of
disadvantages, and possesses, so far as can be
ascertained by the closest scrutiny, not one
redeeming feature to justify its continuance.
Wanted, a Radical Daily Paper.
In New South Wales Parliament two members
lately accused, with perfect justice, the Sydney
daily papers of habitually suppressing the
speeches delivered by Democratic members of
the local Legislature. As usual, the accused
retorted with insolent sneers at the men who
complained, and who had actually dared to
threaten that, if the practice were continued,
they would retaliate by having attention called
to the presence of strangers, and so exclude
the press whenever their favourites rose to
make speeches. The plea of these dailies, so
far as they condescend to plead at all, instead of
affronting their accusers by alleging that they
never say anything worth reporting, is always
the same —that they supply the public with
what the public wants to get, and that no
newspaper could afford to do otherwise. This
looks quite convincing on the surface, but it
will not bear any careful investigation. How
are the public to know whether or not they
want to hear what Mr. O’Sullivan, Mr.
Black, Mr. Fitzgerald, Mr. Cook, Mr.
Walker, or other members have to say or have
said, if these gentlemen’s speeches are never
reported at all? Judges, just as competent as
the conductors of papers who issue standing
instructions that such and such members are
not to be given more prominence than may be
unavoidable, have informed us that on the
occasion which excited Mr. O’Sullivan’s and
Mr. Fitzgerald’s indignation, Mr. Cook’s
deliverance on Federation (The Bulletin here
invites attention to Hansard) was superior in
weight, in freshness of treatment, and in
lucidity of argument to that which ex-Trea-
surer M'Millan delivered. Now, Mr.
M'Millan’s was reported nearly verbatim,
whereas not one single word of Mr. Cook’s was
published. His views were withheld altogether
from the public, which was curtly informed
that “ Mr. Cook also spoke.” Similarly
we are advised that the oration of
Mr. Walker (who is distinctly the most
highly-endowed with rhetorical gifts of any
member of the New South Wales Legislature)
dealt with the entire series of positions taken
up just before by Sir Henry Parkes in his


sentimental speech, and fairly demolished
position after position with a sequence of
logical treatment and a felicity of language and
of illustration which embellished a deliverance
that reflected honour upon the Assembly
wherein it was uttered. The daily morning
papers gave their readers no hint of this. Mr.
Cook, miner and M.P., does hot often speak—
when he does speak he does invariably speak to
good purpose. Mr. Walker is regarded as a
sort of theological and political outlaw by a
number of people. But a fine oration is a line
oration no matter by whom delivered; and a
sound argument is none the less sound because
it is uttered by a person whom you do not like.
Again, supposing Mr. Cook had not before
made any valuable contribution to the
Assembly’s debates. What would not students
of parliamentary history now give to have a
record of the uureported words of “Single-
speech Hamilton ?”
* * *
But, apart from the stupidity of refusing to
the public a hearing of a good speech under
any circumstances, the plea of business neces-
sity will not hold good. The S.M. Herald,
which on every similar occasion has slunk
behind the cell-door—we mean behind the plea
—is perhaps not aware that its own very
existence is a standing demonstration of ths
falsity of the plea that a newspaper, in
order to prosper, must supply the public
with what the public wants. At no single
period of all its money-making career has the
Sydney Morning Herald ever complied with
its own axiom. During the years when it was
the only morning newspaper of Sydney, it was
defiant and contemptuous of the public tastes.
Even now, when competition prods its fat sides
with spur-pricks, it yields but grudgingly to
the demands of the public, and is dull when
they yearn for brightness, and stupid while they
crave for talent. The fact is "that an old-
established daily newspaper, with a deep-
rooted advertising grip, can for long (though
not for ever) afford to neglect the public tastes
and aspirations to an extraordinary degree.
Men in business must buy the paper wherein
are most concentrated trade announcements
which cannot be equally found elsewhere. The
servant out of work, the employer wanting
servants, the man who lends, the man who
desires to borrow, the person with something
to sell, the person who designs to buy, each and
all must purchase the sheet in which there is
the fullest compendium and collection of that
sort of information. Such persons would con-
tinue to buy— muni continue to buy—even
although the rest of the pages were not merely
surrendered to the maunderings of dulness, but
devoted to themes and opinions which were
most distasteful to them. The S.M. Herald
is in its essentials a trader in advertised in-
formation and has the best and biggest assort-
ment. That is its pecuniary backbone. It
throws in news and comments as secondary
attractions, just as a grocer gives lollies to
customers, or the mammoth grocer distributes
coins hidden in slices of a monster cheese at
—Xmas as an inducement to customers to keep
the profitable part of the trade moving.

Moreover, in any limited community, when a
couple of journals can divide between thepi the
monopoly of early intelligence, they can create
a demand to suit their own inclinations, if they
happen to be in accord. This is just the posi-
tion in Sydney at the present time. Both
journals have for years boomed the Freetraders
among public men to the diminishment of Pro-
tectionists of equal ability ; and at present both
are concurring in magnifying the Conservative
sort of representatives and in sinking the
Democratic members out of sight. By fulness
of report, or judicious omissions when to report
fully would be injurious to their prothges, by
constantly recurring complimentary comments,
and little puffing pars, they swell out the
importance of particular men until the public
really believe that these artificially inflated
individuals are the real giants among their
representatives. And inversely, by suppression,
tempered by timely sneers, they diminish the
apparent intellectual and political stature of the
men whom they hold in disfavour, till again
their readers fancy that these persons are com-
parative pigmies, incapable of sustained thought
or coherent argument. This accomplished, it
naturally follows that the public becomes
desirous to know when the supposed giant
moves, and is indifferent about the imagined
pigmy. And thereupon the cause of this pre-
ference dishonestly and disingenuously pretends
to merely bow before and minister to it. If an
illustration be required, a single one will serve
to establish the case we have put. No one in
the capital of New South Wales can yet have
forgotten how B. R. Wise was boomed by both
the morning journals into huge political propor-
tions. And no one can have failed to observe
the utter collapse of that gentleman’s bladdery
fame ever since these papers have ceased to
pump oxygen into his political reputation.
PLAIN ENGLISH.
“The Big Plea”: by The Little Plea.
The exact nature of the purpose intended to be
served by the interview between Mr. E. J.
Welch, the just-returned ex-private secretary
to Dr. Ren wick, N.S.W. representative at
Chicago, somewhat puzzles Oraculardom. The
interview exhales either a freshness of stupidity
or it steams with spleen. Mr. Welch, who, as
an old pressman, probably understands the
value of puli'—even self-puff—opens out by
giving himself a splendid testimonial: —
“You have ” (wrote Dr. Henwick to his invalided secre-
tary) “been a faithful and useful officer, and to the dis-
charge of your responsible duties you have brought a
whole-hearted loyalty,” &o.
Immediately upon which pleasant and con-
vincing introduction follows an (ironical ?)
apotheosis of the miserable little Renwick,
who has been represented by cable—we now
learn maliciously misrepresented—as coiling
up on the doormat of the Colonial Office
in London whining for a title as a pup
whines for a bone. Mr. Welch’s version
has all the “Jesuitical” flavor of a polemical
romance. He tells us pathetically that Ken-
wick never spoke to him about a prospective
knighthood, until he, in rummaging Renwick’s
despatch-box, discovered therein a letter from
Sir Henry Parkes, who “considered it desir-
able—to emphasise the position which Dr.
Ren wick occupied as representative of New
South Wales—that he should go to Chicago as
‘Sir Arthur Ren wick,’” There was also in
that despatch-box “a copy of a letter from
Lord J ersey to Parkes agreeing thoroughly
with the proposition made by Sir Henry, and
stating that he would write by the outgoing
mail and impress ” upon the authorities at the
Colonial Office the necessity of flinging the Poor
Pup a Bone. When Welch congratulated his
boss as “Sir Arthur,” the modest Renwick
remarked, with deliciously complacent self-
abnegation (in our mind’s eye, Horatio, do we
see his deprecatory hand-wave): —“Nonsense,
it may never be ; I have no personal ambition
for it; but evidently, as you see, Sir Henry
Parkes and Lord Jersey consider that it would
very much improve my position going amongst
those democratic people with a title.” Here
bathos collapses and yells for onions. Imagine
the scene. Poor little Squashsquirt, M.D.,
aspiring to impress “ those democratic people ”
(among whom George Washington himself
went title-less) with a brand-new British
Bladder! Mr. Welch declares, on his say-
so, that Renwick “ didn’t care two straws
about this promised title, except in so far as it
might facilitate his labours on the other side.”
“ Except ! ” Oh, the martyrdom of it ! He
was prepared to sacrifice himself upon the
altar of his suffering country ! They all are !
Every huckster who finds himself by Grad-
grindery, or accident, or otherwise, spitted
aloft on some temporary political skewer,
“ doesn’t care tuppence for a knighthood,” re-
gards it as a hollow and ridiculous bauble ; hut,
should the “bleeding country” call upon him
to be so branded, he is (like Dibbs and Ren-
wick) perfectly prepared to face the awful
ordeal. As if the gibbering patriot would
accept smallpox, or anything that brings no
Bauble and no Loot, on behalf of his “ berlovid
country.” Having apologised for and explained
away Renwick, Welch prompts the reporter—
or the reporter prompts Welch —to take a rise
out of Premier Sir George Republican Dibbs,
the bearer of a “recently conferred distinction
which had only been acquired shortly before
our arrival, and which was the subject of un-
disguised mirth and scornful reference on all
sides.” Welch does not omit to eject a
venomous squirt at the apostate Dibbs’ big
swear in New York, snap-shotting it short off
with all the professional embellishment of a
true photographer. It is easily seen that
Welch cordially dislikes Dibbs. Perhaps he
has good reason for so doing ! But, the question
is—Does Welch also hate Dr. Renwick ? Had
he been the little big-man’s most implacable
enemy, he could not have devised a more
brutally effective method of holding up to
public scorn and derision the insignificant
bauble-hunter who misrepresents at Chicago
Exhibition an Imperialistically - electroplated
country which is democratic at heart.

A Superannuation Swindle.
It has been finally ascertained that the New
South Wales Civil Service Superannuation Fund
is absolutely and utterly insolvent. It has also
been ascertained that the insolvency has been
brought about by the practice of allowing
favoured individuals, blessed with political
influence, to retire on full pension many years
before the prescribed age. This is the delicate
manner in which the report expresses the situa-
tion ; if the document had been put in plain
Australian language it would have set forth
that the fund has been ruined by breach of
trust, fraudulent misappropriation, embezzle-
ment, highway robbery, and bushranging. The
Superannuation Fund was created in order
that every civil servant might receive a pension
at the age of 60, or earlier if permanently
disabled by illness, and that certain small
allowances might be made to any one who lost
his place through retrenchment. The fund is
supported almost entirely by the contributions
of the Service, and the amount of these con-
tributions was calculated to meet the demands
above-mentioned, and nothing more. The
ordinary public servant never, by any pos-
sibility, got more than his bond ; but a
large number, who were blessed with in-
fluence, seem to have retired successfully
as early as the age of 33, with full pension.
Some of them presented medical certificates
slating that they were suffering from incurable
complaints, and then went into private business
and now earn respectable incomes, while at the
same time drawing a liberal allowance from the
fund on the ground of hopeless disablement.
Others seem to have been pitchforked into the
service merely that they might presently be
“ retrenched ” out of it and draw a salary for
doing nothing ever afterwards. The Parkes
Government was by far the greatest sinner in
this respect. It had, of course, no more earthly
right to endow its friends in such a fashion
with the savings of the civil servants than it
had to confiscate the funds of the A.M.P.
Society for their benefit, or to make their pen-
sions chargeable on the reserve fund of the Q.
N. Bank, and the one act is as absolute a rob-
bery as the other. Moreover, the Superannua-
tion Fund is so convenient a means of bribery
that the evil is not likely to end here. The
only positive remedy seems to be that the civil
servants should appoint their own managers
and themselves administer the fund, each con-
tributory having a vote. It is practically an
insurance society ; each civil servant is a policy-
holder ; and the Government has no more claim
to control its affairs than it has to take over by
main force the management of the Colonial
Mutual or any other society, and get drunk
with the cash.

A Lucky Shark,
Last week, Nathan, of the Australian Banking
Co. swindle, was tried for his share in that
monstrous imposture, and being found guilty
the law squashed him with a sentence of nine
months. Nathan, upon the evidence, was the
first cause of the Australian Banking Co., and
about the most brazen and conscienceless
adventurer in the whole gang by whom it was
worked. It was he who created the institution by
selling to it an utterly worthless money-lending
business, and who took a huge amount in paid-
up shares in exchange for the “ good-will ” of a
one-room office with a table in it, two or three
chairs, and a blotting-pad. It was he, also,
who had the stupendous gall to inform the
court that when he performed this swindle he
was a mere youth—an unsophisticated child of
nature—and that he didn’t even know the
meaning of “scrip.” The idea of a Hebrew
money-lender—a man who was occupied in
making advances at usurious interest on
shares, bond - warrants, and every form
of tangible security professing to be
ignorant of the most common term employed in
every-day business is interesting, to say the
least, and it seems almost a pity that the court
didn’t cross-examine the blushing Israelite a
little further to ascertain if he knew what was
meant by ink, or if he had ever heard of
postage-stamps. It was Nathan also who,
when he quitted the Australian Banking Com-
pany, straightway proceeded to found another
bank of much the same character, which has
since burst. It was he, to all appearance, who
led Mathey to his ruin and made him a scape-
goat. Unlike Abigail, who toiled for many
years in his grindery emporium on Brickfield
Hill, Sydney, he seems never to have done one
stroke of honest work in his whole useless
existence; he was by nature a hawk, a financier,
money - lender, pawnbroker, bill-discounter,
pedlar, floater of bogus companies, usurer,
trader in scrip, and unadulterated vampire.
But he had the luck to be tried before one Judge
while Abigail had the ill-luck to be tried
before another; consequently Abigail re-
ceives five years and Nathan exactly nine
months. If the Judges had been re-
versed, the chances are that Nathan
would have got ten years and Abigail
about 26 weeks. There is no system or method
about the administration of justice; the punish-
ment doesn’t fit the crime—it only tits the liver
of the presiding Judge. If sentences were
fixed—as they ought to be—by the jury rather
than by the bench, then the sentence would fit
the jury’s liver instead. Only in the latter
case the sentence would express the mean
derangement of twelve livers instead of the
maximum derangement of one, and by this
device a much better average would be arrived
at. This is why The Bulletin wants juries to
be allowed to fix sentences. No man’s fate
should hang entirely on one liver.
A New Australian Magazine.
In the bright lexicon of Young Australia there is
no such word as name-reverence. Yet here is
a new magazine, the Antipodean (written in
Australia, published in London), well printed,
well illustrated, well got-up generally— hut run on
names. It is edited by George Essex Evans and
John Tighe Ryan, both evidently on the high road
to a glorious Cockney hyphenation. Amongst
the literary contributors are one Countess, three
Honorables (“within the colony”) two knights,
two Cabinet Ministers, one ex-Oabinet Minister.
Some of these days a man with an ordinary name
say, Smith—too ugly or too modest to print his
own portrait in his own publication, and too
level-headed to print the portraits of any adver-
tising nobodies, will arise and make at least a
decent living out of an Australian magazine.
This man Smith will look after the matter and let
the names take care of themselves ; he will jerk
into the waste-paper basket the opoponaxed MS. of
the Duke’s high-collared second cousin Mont-
morenci de Jobkins, and will proceed to apotheo-
size the scraps of tea-paper whereon are traced
the lucubrations of the nameless Bohemian whose
toes protrude from his boots. It is only the slop-
clothes of literature that fit the general-public.
Literary Tailors by Special Appointment to his
Excellency This or That have the best part of
their goods in the gold letters on the big plate-
glass window. This is mainly what is the matter
with the Antipodean : it is made of names.
The Countess of Jersey opens the ball by stating
that the “aim of the Antipodean is to form a
literary link between the Mother Country ” —we
always think of it as the Mother-in-law Country
“ and those of her children who live beyond the
seas.” Despite her ladyship’s silence on the
point, The Bulletin has reason to believe that
another aim is to supply a “ long-felt want.” The
Mother Country and her children, you see, abso-
lutely yearn to know more about good old postur-
ing, much-photographed Sir Henry Parkes, and
he is not backward in supplying the desired
information. The Brummagem bard and martyr
has two sour-grape poems in this number, the first
(“Weary”) addressed to his “Weary, weary,
weary heart,” and the second (“Solace”) also
about himself. Both are mere variants of verses
printed long ago by the writer in “The Beauteous
Terrorist” —the authorship of which latter, by the
way, was first revealed to the world in these
columns —and both ring the changes on the melan-
choly fact which sticks out between the lines that
Dibbs, not Parkes, just now (though it may not
be for much longer) sits in the seat of the N.S.W.
Colonial Secretary. The poet is—
“ Weary of the joys that pain,
Dead-sea fruit whose ashes fall,
Drying up the summer rain,
Charnel dust in cups of gall.”
Also—
“ Wrapt in a robe of thankfulness ”
which we take to be a new sort of poetic pyjama—
I bless the sick bed where I lie,
While thoughts of others sharing less
Of comfort cloud mine aching eye.”
“ Mine aching I!” Thrice-blessed consumma-
tion ! How glad the world will be to find that
Parkes feels his “ I ” ache at last!
It is one of the painful results of being a
“ cauliny ” that when any Australian produces a
piece of decent verse the cognoscenti sniff through
a lordly nose and patronisingly say : “Not bad,
you know, but too suggestive of Bret Harte.”
This is the only fault that Parkes’s poetry hasn’t
got. It isn’t in the least like Bret Harte.
Sir Henry Parkes also writes “ William Charles
Wentworth and John Dunmore Lang: an Imagin-
ary Conversation.” As an effort in the vein of
Lucian, Landor and Traill, it is a painful crudity
and an impotent failure; it is a brilliant success
merely as an exhibition of sordid vulgarity, ludi-
crous self-inflation, littleness, and insolent pre-
sumption on that public ignorance and forgetful-
ness which for 50 years have been the stock-in-
trade of the man from Brummagem. The subject
of the “conversation” is the N.S.W. Upper
Chamber. Parkes (who has filled the Legislative
Council with mere political carrion—a lot of
whom, by the way, subsequently appeared in
public as creditors of his) impudently makes
Wentworth tell about “the ignorant will of a
truckling minister” (name?). He makes Lang
say of the members of the present N.S.W. Counci
that it is better not to enquire into their ante-
cedents —“ the police, lam told, have enough to
do.” He makes Wentworth ask; “Had our
compatriots no sons?” and Lang reply; “The
thought is bitter. What is his name who occupies
your chair in the model Upper Chamber?” The
name, as a name, is unfortunate; but what of
that? “No Aristides, no Alfred, no Washing-
ton ? ” enquires Wentworth. Certainly not:
there has been too much Parkes.
* # #
Sir Samuel Griffith* who now obviously sees
the hideous mistake his political life has been,
squirms and wriggles characteristically on “The
Coloured Labour Question in Australia.” “The
continuance of Polynesian immigration,” he now
soothingly tells us, “can neither be permanent nor
assume large proportions.” The Northern Judas
may be safely left to stew slowly in his own gravy.
W. O. Hodgkinsou (has anyone of the present
generation ever read the lovely but unclean scien-
tific hoax he palmed off on the poor unsuspecting
clergy of the S. M. Herald in the long ago?)
writes a pleasant little story concerning the matri-
monial adventures of one Ah Kim. Miss Lilian
Blair grows melancholy about a Samoan girl,
Solita, who wanted to dance but died instead.
The melancholy is tempered to the sympathising
reader by a picture of a very pretty little Samoan
which stands at the beginning of the story and is
called after Miss Blair. What has happened to Miss
Jennings Carmichael, who but the other day wrote
so neat and swinging an “In Memoriara” to
Tennyson, that she should give us two such lines
as these in a set of verses ?
Lift red to my lips your bubbling wine,
Quickening the physical pulses fine !
* # #
J. B. O’Hara’s “A Forest of the Dead ” is, as
a piece of literature, perhaps the best thing in the
book, but it might be a great deal better (or
possibly somewhat worse) if Mr. O’Hara didn’t
know his Gordon and Kendall and Marcus Clarke
so well. By the way, Mr. O’Hara seems to think
that “ warrigal ” means a wild dog. We have
never heard the term so used, but have taken it as
applying to wild cattle or horses only. In Queens-
land it has been used, like “ myall,” to denote a
wild blaekfellow. Mr. H. J. Taperell writes of
“The Australian (Titheradge and ‘Bob’ Brough
and George Rignold!) Drama Mr. Price Fletcher
has something about Australian scenery. “Types
of Australian Beauty ” consist of a reproduction
of eight ladies’photographs. The first lady (the
eight are unnamed, but are all tolerably well-
known in “society”) is distinctly pretty, and so,
in perhaps a less degree, are several of the
others; but one of the group looks 15 if
a day, and two certainly have (or is it that they
ought to have?l a half-set of artificial teeth each.
We fear that Messrs. Evans and Ryan have been
selecting their beauties as they apparently pick
their contributors —on their names and addresses.
Mr. Evans writes a “ Song of Life,” founded on a
basis of solid and eternal fact, and accompanied
by a portrait of the gifted author, with sad, weird
eyes gazing out into the immensities of the Here-
after through the infinite heart-yearnings of the
Now. The veteran David Blair turns up smiling,
spectacled, and reminiscent as of yore, in “ The
Night of the Grand Debate.” But what’s the
matter with the real names of the gentlemen who
figured on that occasion ? Mr. John Tighe Ryan
writes “Ab6ut Interviewing his victims,
Parkes, Max O’Rell, and H. M. Stanley.
Jennings Carmichael has an interesting little
sketch, “The Children of the Bush,” with an
admirable mechanical illustration, “Gin and
Piccaninny.” Grace Channing Neill has firm
ideas about “The Antipodean Girl.” Accord-
ing to Mrs. Neill, “the. native daughter of
this sun-loved land ” is “ slight in figure,
small-featured, with delicate complexion and
“tiny hands and feet” (11 1). Also when she
is a bush girl she “fears neither man nor horse.” As
an expression of frantic recklessness “ fearsjneither
God nor horse ” would be a lot more comprehen-
sive. Before she marries, the Australian girl is
“ piquante, bright, and pretty,” and has a “wil-
lowy slouch.” “Willowy slouch” is distinctly
good. After she is married she “ gyrates’twixt
Rabies and bed.”
* * #
Harry I. Blake is the best-looking man in the
book. There is nothing else remarkable about his
Kanaka sketch. “ Philip Dale ” writes about
Jenny who loved a bold stockman but married
somebody else and half promised to run away with
the bold stockman, whose unhallowed proposals
were overheard by the somebody else. This
cunning individual tells Jenny that she can run if
she likes, whereupon Jenny, of course, doesn’t
like, and “ with a sigh she drew his arms about
her and pressed her head upon his breast, as upon
a rock of strength and goodness.” The story stops
right here, and there is reason to believe that
Jenny stays with the old man. Henry Lawson
has a story—not quite up to his standard—about
“Christmas in the Far West,” and about a man
(whom he curiously enough calls a “solitaire”)
humping a corpse about. 0. E. Robin,
8.A., who evidently knows his subject,
writes in a patronising and humorous way
about “The Antipodean Schoolboy.” “ Chris-
tophus” has a story about my “Gulf Hel-
met.” It is founded on fact, and supported
by Christophian imitations of Jerome K. Jerome’s
style of humour. For a taste: “ After nearly
knocking down six people and injuring a lamp-
post I took off my helmet and walked home with
it in my hand. I was not afraid of sunstroke
because my head was amply protected by three
largo bumps.” When Christophus does get hold
of a good thing he sticks to it. The Antipodean
is most excellently illustrated—mainly by Messrs.
Frank Mahoney, Percy Spence, and G. E. Minns.
It is published by Messrs. George Robertson and
Co. at the popular price of a shilling.
Again the moral of jury sentences, with
savage ones in Melbourne last week.
The Western Champion credits “The
Banjo’s” Bulletin verses, “Those Names,” to
the Peak Downs Telegram.
When does it cease to be mutinous to dis-
obey the commands of a man no longer capable of
giving rational orders? “Never,” gays the
N.S.W. “Dead Marine” Board.
It is now, after the event, easy to see
that the officers of the Port Glasgow erred
in tactics by actively participating in the peti-
tion by the crew, after the hurricane, for the
displacement of the captain. The officers should,
as a mere question of dodgery, have remained
neutral. They would have had to supersede the
skipper just the same, and then when the matter
came up for trial in port, they would have been
three unchallengeable witnesses whose evidence
would have settled the facts one way or other.
But as they threw in their lot with the men there
were no witnesses-all the parties were, from a
red-tape point of view, involved on one side or
other in the dispute. All the same, sailors, and
not merely captains, should be represented on the
N.S. W. Marine Board, which, now, is a purely
aristocratic, hodv.

Premier Dibbs, in the alleged interests of
propriety and morality, has stopped the exhibition
of the lady lion-tamer at Fillis’ Circus, and
though that harassed female called and remon-
strated, Dibbs, K.O.M.G. (the lady-tamed Re-
publican lion), presented a cast-iron front and
refused to shift his mental attitude. Dibbs
is hereby requested to explain his position. There
is nothing immoral in a lady being eaten up; there
is nothing in it that can even be called improper.
It may be painful to be bitten to death by a lion,
but a lady of the most brass-bound virtue may go
through the process without a blush. There is
nothing about the business, either, that is specially
demoralising to the spectators ; the crowd that
attends a lion-show is not nearly so far down as
that which haunts a prize-fight, or a dog-fight, or
which tries to get admission to a hanging, or that
haunts the gaol on flogging-day. The business is
dangerous, no doubt, but if the lady is willing, it
is distinctly her funeral and nobody else’s. The
right to do oneself an injury is the inalienable
privilege of every free citizen, whether the self-
injury is done by drink, opium, lion-bite, accept-
ance of a K.C.M.C.-ship, over-exertion, loss
of character through mean equivocation con-
cerning an item of <£looo for travelling expenses,
the publication of poems which cast a doubt
on the writer’s sanity, or any other foolishness.
Moreover, it is a piece of ghastly meanness to
deprive any woman of her means of livelihood.
Unless Dibbs is prepared to put a vote on the
estimates to recompense the lion-female for her
loss, he stands self-convicted of boycotting and
intimidation of a helpless woman to prevent her
following her lawful calling, also he is out on
strike and is a dog in the manger, and is dis-
locating the wheels of industry, and is preventing
the investment of capital—in the purchase of
lions—and is guilty of an outrage against human
freedom, inasmuch as he won’t either do the work
himself on union principles or allow anybody else
to do it by blackleg labour. The Bulletin is
therefore of opinion that Premier Dibbs should be
tried by a Deniliquin jury and get two years.

Wirth’s Circus —it begins to be an open
question if there isn’t too much circus about—
opens on December 23, at the York-street rink,
Sydney. The show is purely Australasian, barring
sundry Arabs and Japanese, and therefo-e it
appeals strongly to the patriotic soul of A'oung
Australia as he blasphemes with his shilling at the
side entrance. Also, it is a large sliow with an
old-established reputation, and when it bursts
forth in all its glory nothing but the pallid fingers
of Death can stop it as a financial spec.

That grisly image of decay, Sydney Opera
House, has brightened up wonderfully under the
Harry Rickards regime, and on Saturday nights
a board with the strange device, “standing room
only,” may be seen at each door, also the same
weird legend turns up about twice during the
week on an average. Nobody—not even the very
oldest of all inhabitants-can remember when
there was standing room only at the Opera House
before. Mr. Rickards has gathered a good com-
pany together, and, with the sagacity of an old
campaigner, he only allows the niggers to pro-
pound one conundrum each during the evening.
Also, he “knocks ’em in the old Kent Road”
with the same leery affability as before, and his
coster sketches are encored six times on an
average. This boundless enthusiasm of an Austra-
lian audience over the coster of the old Kent Road
is a matter which wants explanation. There are
no weak points in the company excepting the pale-
green lady in the dress that hangs straight down
like a green cataract. Johnny Gilmore is worth
special mention as one of the few'*really funny
niggers on record, and Miss Katherine Vinceni,
the lady violinist, is a huge success. The Aus-
tralians may not be prepared to devour great
masses of music at once, but when they get a
little classical melody between two blackfellows’
jokes their enthusiasm is something to be remem-
bered. Also, the “ Ta-ra-ra-boom-de-ay ” dance
by a chorus of eight ladies, with sixteen feet all
flying in the air at once, and sixteen stockings
conspicuously in evidence, and eight back-hairs
coming down simultaneously, seems to fill an
aching void and to supply a long-felt want.

The principal Christmas gorgeousness at
Fillis’ Circus is to be the water pantomime—
-50,000 gallons of the fluid which lies heavy on the
stomach being poured into the arena “in full view
of the audience.” This is what the advertisement
says, though 50,000 gallons of anything couldn’t
well be poured in without the audience noticing it
in any case. The pantomime will be conducted
by 100 artists in canoes, steam launches and skiffs,
and the clown will make his observations from a
raft, and the pantaloon will hold forth in a" punt,
and the fairy chorus will arrive by ketch and will
feed on ship-biscuit and salt-horse to lend an air of
realism to the proceedings, and the wicked sprite
will be located on a coal-hulk, and will shiver her
timbers and so on. Also the rest of the company
■will dash their tarry top-lights.
The other theatres show signs of tremend-
ous activity. At Her Majesty’s “Blue Beard”
is to be put on with even more than the usual
glory of costumes and scenery, and in this
particular variety of gorgeousness George Rignold
stands almost unrivalled. The Lyceum opens
with a burst of magnificence in the shape of
“ Little Red Ridinghood.” Misses Alice Leamar,
Cora Tinnie, Addie Conyers, and Messrs. Robert
Courtneidge, Bert Haslem, Slade Murray, the
Walhalla Family, and others have been specially
engaged, also G. L. Goodman is business manager.
At the Garrick, Fred B. Norton (take the
elevator) promises a season of comedy, with Tom
Cannam as leading comedian. Brough and
Boucicault have taken the favourite Criterion for
six months, and open on Monday with “ Much
Ado About Nothing.” All the old Criterion
company will take a hand, with Sass and the ever-
green Harwood thrown in as additional glories
without any extra charge. Also sundry minstrel
shows and other small fry are to be heard of in
various places.

Lonnen, according to a somewhat maudlin
yarn in the Argus, wept copiously when the
news that he had “gone up one” in his line of
business was telephoned to the Princess’s. Imme-
diately after curtain-fall on the Wednesday night
there came a pathetic tinkle of the telephone-bell.
“Fred Leslie’s dead,” spake a voice from the dis-
tance, whereupon the person listening at the
Princess’s machine dropped the “ receiver ” with
a moan, and the sad tidings echoed through the
theatre. An Argus man, who seems to have been
feasting his eyes upon Lonnen at the time, saw
“ tears trickle down the grease paint ” on his face,
and will never forget the harrowing spectacle. It
is not every journalist who retains such a beautiful
faith in theatrical grief. Most professional theatre-
goers have discovered that actors are prone to
“breakdown” in this manner, and can always
choke at the right time. A disposition to
be “ overcome with emotion ” is noticeable
in every stage artist when he makes a benefit
speech. An affecting sob is a part of his stock-in-
trade which he displays to the best effect on all
suitable occasions. Doubtless Lonnen was sorry
to hear of his friend’s death, but he had no more
natural cause for weeping than has any sym-
pathetic commercial man who learns that an old
pal is no more. Actors, moreover, are not in-
different to the question of salary, and Lonnen,
even while the dew was on his grease paint, could
scarcely help feeling that the demise of a powerful
rival had suddenly improved his own price on the
market. One is rather tired of the old gag about
the down and his private sorrows anyway, and
in this particular sorrow of Lonnen for the loss of
Leslie worldlings will find more artificial hysteria
than genuine human nature.

The possibility of Melbourne being left
unprovided with drama for a whole week was
obviated by a sudden opening of the Opera House
on Saturday last. A band of patriots, announced
as “under entirely new management,” took pos-
session of the premises, and burst forth in a Xmas
revival of “Current Cash.” A lurid Major, upon
whose disingenuous brow a pot-hat is jauntily
poised, seems to be the most mysterious feature of
“ Current Cash.” According to the programme
this man is “ treacherous and base”—and he looks
it. Also, he acts according. He makes a practice
of confessing his sins and wickedness to the foot-
lights, and his method of scowling upon a
bottle-nosed blackmailer (who once caught him
in the act of forging a will) is horrible to
contemplate. In the course of the even-
ing another man disguised as the Fifth
of November comes along to haunt the
Major, which causes him to grind his teeth to
slow music, and discuss with himself the pro-
priety of clearing everybody from his path. A
widow and her daughter, having been reduced to
shirt-making by the forged will, beg for mercy
from the Major; also his delicately-nurtured
niece asks him not to force her to marry a tame
parson, but the Major is obdurate all round. A
colder-blooded ruffian never made faces at the pit.
The present writer has grown old in contemplat-
ing a long line of miscreants who revel in their
infamy, and he now desires to give the Major the
cake. Fortunately, however, the Guy Fawkes
person with a dissembled voice turns out to be
the captain that had his will forged in the first
act, and this generous joke, taken in conjunction
with the timely repentance of the bottle-nosed
interloper, and other unexpected circumstances,
seems to bring the Major to grief. For such as
delight in seeing retribution fall upon the
unrighteous with a sickening thud there are worse
places than the Opera House. Moreover, if they
called at several other theatres just now they
would only find the door shut. “Current Cash”
is up to the average of desperate theatrical
ventures, and the numerous company engaged are,
no doubt, anxious to live. Some of them oughtn’t
to live long, ’tis true, but Fred Carnbourne gives
an amusing sketch of the low comedy boozer, and
Alf. Boothman deserves praise for a successful
attempt at hiding his identity every now and
then.
The Melbourne pantomimes, as it happens, will
start to knock one another out, if possible, on
Christmas Eve. At the Princess’s they are said
to have prepared a costly setting of “The Forty
Thieves.” This show, which inaugurates the new
partnership of Williamson and Musgrove, is
expected to be worthy of the occasion. Lonnen,
Alice Lethbridge, Katie Barry, Lelia Roze, and a
long list of bright visions, are billed to appear as
Thieves, or otherwise, and the rorty Snazelle has
been fetched over by cable from the Cannibal
Islands to play a congenial part.

The close of the B. and B. management
on Friday was followed by an extra special per-
formance to the honour and benefit of Messrs.
Brough and Boucicault on Saturday last. A
densely crowded house, at an advanced scale of
prices, assembled to see the last of the old regime.
“ The Colonel ” gave the company an opportunity
to contribute their valuable services, after which
Lonnen, Stockwell, Theo. Liebe, Alice Lethbridge,
and Snazelle did each a good turn for the late
lessees. Snazelle, by the way, recited a piece
from the works of one Sydney Bulletin. Finally,
Brough and Boucicault delivered valedictory
addresses in two well-contrasted styles—the
emotional and the matter-of-fact. Stockwell
struck up “For they are jolly good fellows,” and
“ Hip-hip-hip !” was the cue for the curtain to
fall.

For “The Babes in the Wood,” at the

Bashall brings her serpentine dance from Sydney,
and old friends like Gourlay, Harry Shine, and
George Carey, figure on the Coppin bill of fare.

In tones adapted to descriptions of heroic

To open the Haleck now-a-days is a solemn thing,

A Santa Claus festival, taking the form of
a gigantic musical oorroboree and a transcendant
wood-chopping tournament, promises to strike
out a new' line in booms at Melbourne Exhibition
Building. The orchestra and brass-band portion
of the festival will commence to shake the time-
honoured welkin on Saturday night, while the
first round of tiie great axe-fight is reserved for
Boxing afternoon. The music-halls wave their
holiday programmes in the Xmas air, and Jere-
miah Brown has arranged to stay and see the
Waterloo Cyolorama through its positively last
month in Melbourne. Jeremiah was 101 years of
age at latest dates, but his personal recollections
of Wellington, Buonaparte, arid the Old Guard
are more extraordinarily vivid than ever.

Cunningham, who is running an Australian yabber-

of the first phase of the dance, the doctor arose hurriedly—

There was a rush to Melbourne Princess’s on the night
following the announcement of Fred Leslie’s death. An
idea that the girls would sport tights of sable hue had
circulated abroad, and many of the audience evidently
anticipated a display of sentiment. Nothing unusual
occurred, though. Burlesque doesn’t offer opportunity
for suggestions of sorrow, or perhaps the sorrow had had
time to abate.
Fred Leslie died of typhoid fever, a disease which lurks
in sewer-gas and such things to capture men who have
“ lived high.” It was probably the effect of bad drains,
acting upon a constitution attenuated by good drains,
that removed poor Fred. His death, following upon
Nellie Parren’s break-up, sets one thinking of those cafd
dinners in Melbourne and Sydney, whereat a party of
four would “put away” some seven or eight bottles of
wine and spirits without turning a hair.
The burlesque artist can be guaranteed to make “sym-
pathetic reference” to his rival at a minute’s notice—

The craze for the manufacture of little Alice Leth-

by the hundred. This preposterous and demoralising
vanity, amid the upper ten, draws crowds. A big crop of
Countess Uussells is being raised.
Leslie must have been more than 35, the age set down
to him in some notices. He was no longer a boy 15 or 16
years ago, when he played Lantier in a travestie of
“ Drink,” at London Royalty. The writer remembers
him as a slim, serious-looking young man of, perhaps, 24,
dancing and singing just a little with Marie de Grey, and
not seeming to take much interest in a stupid part.

Spong, the Bijou scenic artist, off to England, has just

to art in this part. Spong excels in witchery of land-

his powers, while Hennings, Brunton, and Goatcher
appear rather stronger, especially Hennings, on the
architectural side.
Spagnoletti: Think of the scenic artists who have
figured in Melbourne Christmas pieces—Opie, Holmes,
Pitt, Tannett, Hennings, Wilson, Freyberger, Habbe,
Gordon, Spong. Brunton, Goatcher. A glorious muster-
roll of talent, with a few sparks of genius. What a
prodigious amount, what acreages, of magnificent scenes,
have been coolly painted out, after serving, in many
cases, only for the background of a stupendous failure,
like Miln’s “Antony and Cleopatra!”

The synopsis of the accounts of the Anglo-Aus-
tralian Bank (Melbourne), furnished by the Crown Prose-
cutor in opening the case against the directors, reveals
some remarkable figures. Of the 200,000 shares “sub-
scribed,” it is alleged that Staples, the chairman of
directors, took up 192,467 and the other directors took
the balance. One man paid up £37 10s. on his shares ;
the others simply debited themselves with the price of
their shares in the books, so that the aforesaid £37 10s.
was the entire capital of the institution. This w'as the
first issue. Of the second issue, consisting of 50,000
Shares, the chairman took 7000, and a clerk (salary, £3 a
week) took the other 43,000. Neither of them paid a
cent, both being debited with the price of the shares in
the usual manner. The profits were absolutely fictitious ;
the reserve fund was a myth ; the capital was non-
existent ; and the business of the “ bank ” seems to have
consisted entirely of bogus sales to, and bogus purchases
from, another “ bank ” of the same character, and in the
receipt of deposits. Even the “ cash in hand ” is said to
have consisted almost entirely of Staples’ I O U for £7600
—in fact, pretty nearly all the assets were Staples’ IO U
or the I O U’s of other directors.

N.S.W. Full Court has finally decided, by a
two-thirds majority (Chief Justice Barley and Justice

Sydney, was justified in going into the hotel business with
the shareholders’ and depositors’ money. The minority
(consisting of Judge Stephen) very pertinently wants to
know what there is now to prevent the directors of any
“bank” or land company or building society running a
theatre or a circus or a music-hall with the deposits, if
they happen to feel that way. Apparently they can run
all three if they want to. The public would like to hear
Judge Windeyer’s opinion upon the subject—before the
case goes to the Privy Council.

The Liberator Building Society, which smashed
a few months ago in England, now takes rank as the boss
swindle of the decade. The total funds of the concern
were £3,313,000, and of this amount £2,078,445 were lent to
one director, without any security of the slightest value.
Also, £481,950 were lent—likewise without security—to
another society, now burst, in which that director was
interested, and a third society, which is also insolvent,
got £627,000. There was no tangible security in this
case either ; in fact, the directors practically divided over
three millions among them. The present situation is—
liabilities, about £3,500,000 ; assets, supposed to be some-
where between £lO,OOO and £50,000. One director and
the society’s solicitor are in gaol; another director has
resigned his seat in the Commons, and his arrest is
daily expected. Meanwhile the usual fatherly article
about the recklessness of Australian finance appears in
the English papers with its wonted regularity.

Dear Bulletin,—One or two facts to prove that
mining business has not absolutely collapsed in Tasmania.
A month ago Dr. Gorger, the largest shareholder in the
Silver King 00. (Zeehan), cabled out to sell his shares. In
a week or two I placed them all locally, over £lOOO worth,
and rose the market on the deal. A few days ago 5600
Silver Queen shares, held in reserve, were to be
allotted to shareholders. Over 12,000 were applied for.
Early next year there will be half-a-dozen large concen-
trating plants running at Zeehan. The Silver King,
Silver Queen, British Zeehan, Mount Zeehan (Launces-
ton), and Western have all their plants ordered or under
way. As our West Coast silver lead ore is of such high
grade in lead, ranging from 30 to 50 per cent., even if
silver has a further fall, it should still pay to work. —

Exchange).

Broken Hill Proprietary mine calls tenders for
enormous lots of coke and timber. High time the N.S.W.
coke-makers cut in for their big market —though the
conditions and therefore the odds are against them.
Timber-getters are cut out by one word—-Oregon—and
why, the writer hardly knows. Can it be shown that for
mining purposes the soft and, therefore, weak timbers of
America are better to hold up ground than the best of
Australian hardwoods? When asked why they used soft
woods, an Australian manager replied that he assumed
that somebody must own the forests in which they grew.

A miner, who obviously understands his business,
writes in strong condemnation of the management of a
Peak Hill mine. He enumerates blunders and miscal-

machinery. As most N.S.W. gold mines are badly
managed, it would be remarkable if this one were not in
the category.

Another man lets day into the working of Wesb
Sunlight mine, Hillgrove. A month ago the battery was
started with much jubilation. The 10 head, it was
declared, were only an instalment, power enough having
been provided to run 40 head ; and there were to be no
more calls. But, in a few weeks, there is a mysterious
five-hour daily stoppage of the 10 head, some say to get
up steam ; and another, the tenth, call has been made.
How much of the many calls have been paid—how many
shares are really alive for calls, and how many have
perished by forfeiture? 7s. 6d. a share has been paid on
the contributing shares; a heap of cash and paid-up
shares went to the promoters.
What has become of the New Hargreaves mine?
It has the usual N.S.W. mine history. Struck a rich
patch, selected specimens displayed in Sydney, much
newspaper-puffing. Result: a few sales of shares at high
prices, patch worked out; and now we have reached the
stage when a breathless public are told “ The pumps are
working well.”

■ The “discoverer” of Queensland’s biggest
swindle rides into and about town in a carriage. Those
who invested in his show have to walk. In any other
mining community in the world some serious investiga-
tion would have been made into such a gigantic frost.
Was the claim salted, and, if so, by whom?

Big things were one time predicted for Butcher’s
Reef and the surrounding claims. The writer dissented.
Time works wonders for the man who “jumps” on a
mine. Butcher’s Reef “ went ahead so did Bear Hill,
w'hich is near it. £lO,OOO were spent in plant, and over
double in mining w ork. Shares changed hands by the
thousand, and a big comer put Bear Hills up to pounds
apiece. Sans a corner Butcher’s Reef only went to 10s.—
they were never worth as many farthings. Bear Hill
went into decent liquidation—hut poor Butcher’s was
lately seized and sold by the Sheriff for a miserable £llO.
Thus endeth, &o.

Mt. Morgan is still the gold mine of the day,
despite the ruin of many a mad Queenslander who pur-
chased at a value of sixteen or seventeen millions. Last
month it turned out 7649 tons ore, yielding 11,3290 z.
gold. In its palmy days of three years ago, it yielded
over IOOOoz. daily.
* * »
The finding of other Mount Morgans has been a
daily occurrence for years past, and it is likely to be for
years to come. The last appears at Kerr’s Creek, N.S.W.:
“Assays of bulk samples have gone 10ozs., and a 100-ton
crushing is expected to go some ozs. to the ton ’’—the
W'hole hill will probably go an oz. to the ton,”

The jnst-returned-from-England Mr. Justice
Foster, N S.W.: “ The feeling in England was favourable

satisfaction of the English investor. What matter if men
rot in gaol for an imaginary offence so long as the fat-
headed English capitalist is pleased !

The published list of Newcastle collieries form-
ing the N.S.W. United Collieries Co. (capital £3,000,000)
clearly proves that it is simply a combination of nearly
all the small pits with the object of better enabling com-
petition with the bigger ones, such as Wallsend and the
A. A. Co., who will have nothing to do with it.

Seeing that the Mt. Costigan mine is now

Cabled that the Earl of Kilmorey, at a recent
meeting of the Wentworth Proprietary, held in London,
stated that the advising board in Sydney had misled the
shareholders, but since the local management was changed
the profits were at the rate of £60,000 a year. A rich
discovery, such as the owners of the Wentworth mine are
now enjoying, will place the halo of glory around the
worst of management, while a period of barrenness will
condemn the best. At the same time the mine is now
worked on a much better system and is well but expen-
sively managed ; the writer only hopes that the run of
good gold will continue to justify it in the eyes of the
British owners.
* * #
The bulk of the Wentworth gold is contained
in rich arsenical pyrites, which are shipped to Freiburg
for treatment. It is carefully bulk-assayed here, and it
was in this direction that the advisory board made the
mistakes referred to, in London, the other day.

More newspaper eulogy re the Sir Walter Scott
mine, Oangi, N.S.W.: “Stone throughout mine averages

Then there is some puff about soz. rock in certain places
and the battery system is condemned because it only
yielded thereby loz. AH is going to be reformed by the
“hyperphoric” system, otherwise known as Chappie and
Lockwood’s process, of which the writer has heard great
things for three years, but has yet seen little in the way
of results.

846 Maoquarle-street North, Sydney, Dec. 21,1892,
My Dear Moorabinda, —
Here you have a statement of what Lady Tomnoddy
really expects from her liege subjects. lam told, on
excellent authority, that the wife of an Australian Go-
vernor confided to somebody when she got ’Ome that the
Australians are the queerest people she ever met in the
matter of salutations, “ for at public gatherings, where
we were seated on a dais—all the people passing would
stare at us but very few would respect our presence by
bowing —indeed, only those who knew us personally.”
“ Respect our presence by bowing ” is indeed beautifully
English.
The opening of the Nurses’ Home in connection with
the Alfred (named after Dr. Alfred Roberts) Hospital, the
other Tuesday, is like a phantom fashion-plate viewed at
this distance. Lady Jersey (chaperoned by brother
Rupert No. 2, who lets his eye-glass dangle when there’s
nobody looking) officiated—firstly unveiling a bust of Sir
Alfred Roberts in the main hall of the hospital—evidently
inspired (I mean the bust) when the veteran medicine-man
wasn’t so interestingly furrowed and crow’s-footed as he
is now. I suppose it’s meant as a compliment to turn
out a sculpture with a smooth, unmarked countenance as if
the model had spent a lotos-eating life of inertia, or else
had lit on a genuine wrinkle-destroyer.
The Nurses’ Home—a substantial structure with its
necessarily barrack-like air mitigated by a very feminine
drawing-room with a piano and the walls hung with
artistic gift-pictures—was opened from the balcony by
Lady Jersey, looking as smart as a new pin in a marbled
silk with diagonal lines of blue and pink tiny flowers. Her
ladyship’s opening speech was audible and apropos, but
the vice-regal lack of confidence quite spoilt the effect. If
you want to really grasp how far from reposeful is Lady
J. on the stump just watch the eccentric gyrations of the
umbrella somebody inevitably holds over her if the ordeal
is in the open air. The new Admiral and Adrairaless were
tooled out to the opening by their flag-lieutenant. Mrs.
Bovvden-Smith is a tall, jolly-looking woman with dark
hair and a florid complexion, who scrutinises objects of
special interest through a double-glass and seems Inclined
to be dressy. She sported a black and mauve pintc shot
silk spotted with pink flowers, the bodice made with yoke
and half-sleeves of pink silk veiled in black lace ; lace
shoulder-frill and bands of black moire ribbon piped
with pink (the Princess of Wales has made ribbons the
rage, by the way) round the waist; black lace and jet
bonnet with pink feathers. Miss Bowden-Smith was flop-
hatted and floral.
The engaged youth ought to have eyes in the back of
his head, if he wants to make quite sure that he is the
only swain his Angelina leans upon in the gloaming.
Somebody tells me a conversation he overheard between
two actors in a Sydney caf6 the other day which goes a
long way to prove the soundness of Alice Leamar’s
refrain, “For you can’t trust young ladies entirely, you
know.” Said Mummer the First, “You ought to look
blue, old chappie. I hear your little sweetheart is going
to be married." “Well,” said Mummer No. 2, with a
comprehensive wink, “do you think that makes any
difference ?”
But you can’t trust young gentlemen, either. A
Sydney scholastic individual was recently run down in
his trespasses and sins—as a matter of detail, he had
married two wives. But he didn’t neglect either of them
—he sent regular remittances to his English love, and
dragged a red herring over the trail by telling his local
spouse that he was only doing the dutiful to his aged
mother ! What a pity that such a domestic genius should
ever have been found out! It’s difficult enough to find a
husband who can support one wife nowadays, and so it seems
like wasting good material to convict a man who is ready
and willing to keep two going. O, loving schoolmaster,
I salute thee. Ready am I, almost, to become Number
Three.
A number of young “bankers” congregated in Rush-
cutter’s Bay Oval, the other day, and played cricket—
married v. single—to an afternoon-tea accompaniment.
I didn’t go. There’s no novelty nowadays in seeing a
bank-clerk bowled out.
It really isn’t a gaudy thing at all to be a man. Men
get all the outside seats and all the draughts and do most
of the paying. In a Sydney parsley-hunt to be heard in
February, the wife seeks to shake off her husband, a
young and clever doctor, well-known in Melbourne, who
plays the fiddle divinely, and the Doc. has been ordered
to pay over funds to enable her to carry on the case.
“ Write me out a cheque, Henry, I’m going to apply for a
divorce,” any wife may say, and if he doesn’t pay up the
law will make him. And yet women-suffragists want to
give the sexes an equal chance 1
The discovery that passages of most doubtful “morality’’
were being analysed by students in the recent junior
exams, at Sydney ’Varsity throws a lurid light on the
sweet girl graduate. In future the damsel whose maternal
parent has interdicted Zola will simply “ go up for the
junior.” What a little innocent the girl who got A for
English literature in this year’s scramble must be !
Miss Maggie Moore and Mrs. Lionel Rignold had a front
seat at the amateur performance of “ Caste,” at Waverley,
on 14th inst., and Miss Moore was deeply absorbed in
seeing for the very first time, from the front, a play in
which she had frequently disported as Polly. The ordi-
nary amateurs’ Esther, D’Alroy and the Marquise were
the usual thing. Esther was a lady who would have been
invaluable in a row over the back-fence, and galvanised
broomsticks would have played as well as the other two.
But the youngsters were very interesting. Professional
opinion was that young Titheradge always looked like his
pa—young Anson sometimes, and Emery was like the
juvenile apparition of his father. As for the first two,
their acting was a fair reproduction of the methods of
their sires. To my mind, that was the worst feature of
the show. Neither young Tith. nor Anson, jun., had a
scrap of original business, though, perhaps, the latter, in
the last act, was accidentally a little more original in his
dressing than pa ever attempted to be. Young Emery’s
Genidge was a convincing performance
I am told, on undoubted authority, that Lord Jersey
has one great Australian ambition—to help in catching a
big shark. The overtures of anybody in a position to
allow his Ex. to take part in the capture of a fourteen"
foot blue pointer will be received in a most friendly spirit
at Government House.
All the hoarse-voiced little Sydney newsboys were, last
Saturday, entertained at tea by the popular Quong Tart—
after first having paraded the city with a band and many
banners. Swarmed round the tables they looked very
poor and ragged, but their faces were clean, and their
behaviour wonderfully good. At the end of the feast one
youngster, unasked, chivalrously helped the waitresses to
clear up. In the outward rush the door-keepers handled
the small guests rather as if they wrre bags of potatoes
on a wharf, but I suppose boys are used to that sort of
thing and would feel hurt if they didn’t get it. By the
way, when three cheers for (he Queen were called for, a
good portion of the small assembly groaned with gusto.
Lord Jersey gives the newsboys a tea at Government
House on 27th instant. They’ll probably cheer the Queen
there all right enough—and it is to be hoped better
manners will prevail than obtained on last occasion—when
“Ob ! Mr. Jersey, come an’ fire this cove out! ” “ Pass
the butter, please, Mrs. Jersey” were considered by the
young rascals correct forms in which to address their
vice-regal entertainers.
Viewed strictly from a social standpoint, the re-election
of Mr. W. P. Manning as Mayor of Sydney (tor the third
consecutive time) is quite a success. Not that his term
of office has been remarkable for hospitality so profuse as
to be vulgar ; but when he and Mrs. Manning have enter-
tained, they have entertained extremely well. Since
their advent peace has brooded over the Town Hall, and
I am told that the Mayor is the most preoisely-business"
like functionary who has held sway over the civic funds
within the memory of man.
The queer New Australia movement now raging
presents a flowery chance to the woman who gasps for
matrimony and is in a tolerable state of moral and
physical repair. The leaders of the May Flower-ish crowd
who are setting forth from Australia to found a settle-
ment in the Argentine (green fields far off !), “ are ready
to take women members without payment, either with
their husbands—who pay, of course—or as single girls.
One reason for the latter is that a large number of our
members are single men, who desire to marry women of
their own race and language, to make homes for them-
selves, and to lead am honest and moral life. In the
western districts of N.S.W. and Queensland the men vastly
outnumber the women; in Tasmania the proportions
seem reversed ; in the Argentine settlement they want
a fair balance, which is natural in healthy communities,
so that every Jack may have his Jill and every Jill her
Jack.” All the women are to be “healthy and moral,”
and all the men “ strong, straight, and manly,” and
moral, too, and there are to be six of one and half-a-
dozen of the other, and the result will be heavenly—on
paper. Yes, if the new colony lives up to its posters,
Heaven will have a formidable rival in the Argentine
settlement.
Miss Louise Galvin, “ the phenomenal contralto,” made
her appearance as a child of promise in the York street
Hall, on 14th inst., in a concert engineered by Daddy
Hallewell. Miss Galvin is a slip of 16, with dark eyes and
hair as becomes a contralto, and if she doesn’t grow any
more she won’t be too continuous for the tights of Siebe)
and Lazarilloas is her facial double, Madame Yanderveer
Greene. Long legs are as great a handicap to the stage
contralto as a double chin is to the soprano. Little
Galvin’s vocalism is embryotieally sweet, rich, musical
and pathetic, and well merits persistent educating for
the highest rung. Miss Gibson, Mr. Cork and the
Orpheus Society appeared on the bill, where a bald-
headed tenor also disported on the high 0. Humour
insists that this youth is going on the stage, where Ijhope
his scalp will be concealed by a flowing wig. We have
stood the amorous shriek of the tenor with a tar-barrel
outline, and tried hard to believe the soprano really loved
him, but I don’t think we could be carried away by a bald-
headed man warbling on his knees in the limelight.
On dit that a certain ladies’ committee for the Chicago
Exhibition went up the other day to a sculptor’s studio
to view the bust of a legal Sir Somebody ordered for the
big show. The plaster presentment was sloped off (as is
the somewhat top-heavy style of busts) just at the
clavicle, but when the cultured committee females saw it
they were stricken with mortal disappointment. “The
likeness is veiiy good,” said Lady Blank, at last, in a
tearful voice, “but only look at the shoulders I—not half
wide enough. Sir Somebody has fine shoulders—he isn’t
pinched up like this!” “But, madam,” said the
astonished Pj'gmalion, “ the shoulders aren’t depicted
—it is taken off at the collar-bone”—but his remonstrance
was drowned in a war of female voices. “If those aren't
shoulders, / know nothing about art,” said one fussy old
lady, with unconscious truthfulness, and the disgusted
clay-worker (just from Hingland) knew that the Philis-
tines had indeed come upon him !
A certain committee, by the way, has been making an
asa of itself over pictures ordered from an artist to go to
the World’s Fair. First a big one was ordered, and
painted, but when it was up to framing-point, the com-
mittee femininely enough changed its mind, and altered
to a couple of small ones. These were done, and now' the
artist is waiting to hear from that committee, and the
committee has evidently forgotten all about it. The
artist-man has whole stacks of convincing official corres-
pondence, per medium of which he could make these
unbusinesslike seraphs pay up like sportswomen in any
law-court - but he doesn’t want to frighten ’em out of
their wits, and, besides, no man expects anything else
from a woman. But, mind you, there are some of these
daisies who shriek loudest for female suffrage and the
equality of the sexes ! They might pause and reflect that
if the sexes had been made equal, a lot of ’em would now
be telling their ages in the witness-box.
From Messrs. Paling and Co. I have received a copy of
their shilling Xmas Annual with a coloured picture of
Government House by full moonlight on the title-page,
and an assortment of songs within, that ought to meet
everybody’s case, ranging as they do from “ What are
the Wild Waves Saying ”to “ They’re After Me.” The
annual is full music-size ai d clearly printed, and should
appeal strongly to people who like a very wide variety of
ditties.
Yours affectionately,
SATTHO SMITH.

Residents of Mount Barker (S.A.)' are
anxious to purchase the mural tablet- (to the
memory of Captain. Barker, who was killed by
the natives in 1821$ and after whom the town was

the top of King-street, Sydney. A' subscription
for the purpose is-talked of. We presume that it
is utterly unlikely that any historical record would
be sold by the church authorities.
The other day, iniSydney Supreme Court,
Judge Windeyer told Salomons, Q.'O., to “sit
down, sir !’’ Whereupon Salomons left court
declaring that he would never again practise
before the Judge. However* mutual friends inter-
vening, the trouble was amicably squared by next
day. There has been bad blood between the pair,
dating from the time when Salomons was ap-
pointed to the N.S.W. Chief-Justiceship and
Windeyer said nasty things about him.
“Contrary to expectation, the late Jay
Gould left nothing whatever to charitable or

Blowitz, the Times correspondent, supplies
an instructive advance notice of the Austrian
prince now making his royal way to Australia.
“He has the long, wan face of the Hapsburgs,
sheepish and without character; a leaden eye, a
thin and expressionless mouth, a slow and
uncertain gait. His physiognomy is at once
timid, sly and malicious. . . He is one of the
most ignorant princes of the day. At 18, when
his professors bade him adieu, he burnt all his
books, vowing that he would never touch another
book in all his life, and he has so far kept his
word. . . He has never been able to speak a
word of English.”
There are moments in the lives of each of us
when, in the midst of unexpected, unforeseen danger, we
shall require (o exercise to its utmost extent all the
nervous power we may possess. And there is no greater
foe or danger to happiness than debility, which ought to
he cirefully warded off. In the following case Mr. E.
Robinson, of Tuniul, N.S.W., gives his experience of it:
“For the last three or four years I have been conscious
that my strength, and in an equal degree my spirits, were
waning. I was losing all interest in anything and in
everything. I could not account for it. lat last began
to suspect I might have the seeds of consumption sown in
my system, and that they' were bringing forth fruit. I
saw your advertisement in the Sydney Herald, and
resolved to try what Marshall’s Tonic Nervine could do
for me—this was five months ago. I have completed a
course of 18 bottles, and I can truly say a man in better
health and spirits cannot exist. I eat well, sleep well,
and take any amount of physical exercise, long walks,
and feel no fatigue, and my strength is apparent to me in
every movement I make, every step I tike. All this I
owe to you and yonr sovereign remedy. Let the world
know. You are only too welcome to publish this, in the
hope other poor sufferers may make use of your strength
giving fluid.’’ Will “other poor sufferers’’ lies'tate now?
Marshall’s Tonic Nervine is within the reach of all.
Economy with a vengeance. The Tas-
manian Government storekeeper has discovered iw
an odd corner of his department a bale containing

which the Treasurer has ordered to he dyed “ for

A RACE-TIME REMINISCENCE.
1ST GIRL: “How did you come off over the Cup?"
2ND GIRL: “Went down 10 bob on G’Naroo, but, pooh! I don’t
care. Serves the owner right—they should have jigged"
him for the Caulfield.”
1ST GIRL: “Well, I lost a quid on Malvolio, but you can’t expect
horses to race in a bog, and I’ll be on him again before-
the meeting’s over.”
2ND GIRL: “You let him alone and wait for the Summer Cup.
I know something good, and they’ll have to spiel him
because the stable’s stiff.”

Parkes, when not whining of His “breach
less home ” and yowling dismally about how he
“now stands in the light of the grave” (sup-
pressedl sobs from his red-headed caricature in
petto, Alfred Allen) sometimes becomes cheeky
and defiant’ and says out loud before the Almighty
that he is going to live until be is 120 years- old!
If so (we have Just been reading up the O’Farrell
business in connection with Parkes’ clumsily-
attempted self-vindication) it vvill take him all bis-
remaining days on earth to explain how it was
that he, when one of' the chief Ministers of’ a pre-
tendedly civilised State, sneaked into a gaol)
planted l a detective-reporter behind a oell-dbor,,
and entering the cell of a helpless man about to
be arraigned for his life at the bar of justice, pro-
ceeded, in > the absence of the wretched prisoner’s
counsel, and without cautioning him as the meanest
policeman would or should l have done,, to extract l
from the miserable lunatic evidence to damn him
at what was practically a drum-head court-martial.
Parkes himself is mad—on the subject of titular
glory and Imperial baubles: The unhappy
O’Farrell had shot a duke of the Blood Royal)
and the soul of the parvenu from Brummagem
went out in horror at the sacrilege. Parkes, who
now can’t have much over 60 more years to live,
professes to believe in God. Let him go down on
his knees for 50 of those years and pray that he
and all the rest of the Treason-Felony Govern-
ment may be forgiven for their horrible blasphemy
against Justice, which, with the equally hideous
Mount Rennie trial, the blood-responsibility of
which rests on the souls—if they have souls—of
still-living men, constitute “ a red-hot hissing
burning brand of shame that will never be
effaced.”
Messi’s. Frost and Shipham, “My Opti-
cians,” of 462. 474 and 587 George-street, Sydney,
issue a lengthy and very complete price-list of
photographic, optical, and electrical goods. No-
body ever realises how many things are embraced'
under these headings until he studies some such
publication as this. The list includes photo-
cameras —about 40 different kinds of them, dry-
plates, lanterns, printing frames, sensitised paper-
chemicals, stands, rectilinear lenses, symmetrical
lenses, iris diaphragms, condensers, slides, view
finders, pocket levels, photometers, aotinographs,.
focussing lenses, ruby lamp, isochromatic plates,.
films, opals, and burnishers. Then the document
gets its second wind and goes off into a great
waste and wilderness of pastes, solutions, varnish-
developers, magic lanterns - several dozen differ-
ent kinds, alum troughs, animalcule troughs,
carriers, regulators, chemical tanks, connectors,.
saturators, generators, lime cylinders, lime
holders, lime tongs, purifiers, retorts, microscope-
attachments, compressed gas, magic lantern slides,
and And after that the book
braces itself up afresh, and the way it goes on
about chromatropes, cyoloidotropes, figureotropes,.
choreutoscopes, pandiscopes, spectacles, eye-
glasses, telescopes, microscopes, barometers, ther-
mometers, hydrometers, barkometers, compasses,,
galvanic batteries, shock coils, magneto-electric
machines, telephones, electric bells, model loco-
motives and steam-boats is something awful to-
contemplate. We now sit down to have a long:

Our sorrow’s deep.

He came like a Buffalo Bill,.
Ned Kelly and larrikin, cocky,.
Rolled into one, put through the mill;.
And then, sweated down to a jockey:
Jay Gould’s last dealing with his gold
Deserves some admiration;
Unfit for place within the fold,
He would not buy salvation.
’Twixt Jayq when feeling well or ill,
We find no mean disparity—
He lived for greed, and, in his will.
Still scorned the name of charity.

All the conservative papers know the

not succeeded.” Yet Mr. Day sat in the editorial

The full secret history of the O’Farrell

write it, and will “ affix the brand of shame where

The Sydney dailies, pleading in chorus to
the charge that they systematically suppress
democratic speeches uttered in the legislature, say
that “they supply the public with what the public
wants to get.” “The worst of lies is the lie
which is half the truth.” The dailies’ plea is
founded on the incontrovertible fact that they
only supply the public with what (by a policy of
suppression and distortion) they have trained the
public to “want to get.”
One of the items of expenditure in the
Maoriland financial statement is : “ Expenses in
connection with the hamper of game sent to Her
Majesty, <£22 7s. 9d.” Sir Pat. Buckley is
responsible for this item ; he sent the game along
as a burst of jubilation when he got his title, and
charges the bill to his country. The Bulletin
devoutly trusts that the contents of the hamper
smelt bad when it arrived at the Tower of
London, or wherever Buckley addressed it to.
Ex-Premier Griffith’s private secretary
proposes, according to the Brisbane Worker, to
run for Dalby at next election in the Labour
interest. Next we will probably hear that More-
head and M‘llwraith are running on the Labour
ticket and that Pat. Perkins is going to the poll
in the republican, communistic, teetotal, and
blood-red anarchist interest. If any Queensland
worker votes for anything connected with Griffith
on such a thin pretence, the fact ought to serve as
a warrant to put him in gaol.
It is a mystery why the professedly liberal
N.S.W. provincial papers have published without
comment the countless circular letters of the
National Ass extolling the proposed bogus
“ Thrift ” vote. The Bulletin presumes that it
would have been too glaring a swindle— swindling
no objection, only the glare of it—to propose
giving the rich man one vote and the poor man
none, though when it’s boiled down the National
Ass plan amounts to pretty nearly the same
thing.
In the discussion upon the Victorian silver
coinage question, most of the daily papers speak
of the great profit to be made by that province in
the event of its being allowed to coin silver. It
should be remembered that the profit made in
silver coinage is in reality only a loan without
interest, which is repaid as the coining Govern-
ment withdraws the light coin from circulation.
In fact, by buying back the light coin at its face
value, the Government loses on the whole transac-
tion the value of the attrited metal.
Dear Bulletin, —Here is a passage from
Prof. Stanley Jevons’ work “Logic,” a text-book
in the hands of all N.S.W. University students.
Under the head of “Logical Fallacies” he says:—
It is by fallacy of composition that protective duties are
still sometimes upheld. Because any one or any few
trades which enjoy protective duties are benefited thereby,
it is supposed that all trades at once may be benefited
similarly. But this is impossible, because the protection
of one trade, by raising prices, injures another.
If Australia is not a nation of Freetraders, it
deserves to be. Jevons’ is not the only text-book
prescribed by our Universities that is steeped in
this kind of thing.—R.P.T.
The Homestead Settlement of Mylor, S. A.,
held its first annual fete 3rd Dec. in celebration of
the successful starting of a settlement of over 209
‘blockers,” representing families about 809
strong, and to raise funds for a Public Hall and
Institute. There were outdoor sports and an
evening concert. The evidences of the success of
co-operative settlement were to be seen on every
hand, and this is the first real spurt of encourage-
ment these settlements have received. There was
a little overmuch butter and patronage from
Adelaide politicians who came up to see the
settlement, but the Mylorians were too cock-a-
whoop to notice it. A few Mylors in Australia
would put an extinguisher on the Argentina
insanity;
The recent disgraceful scene at Williams-
town (Vic.) Court, when* during the hearing of a
police case, a magistrate, father of a defendant,
took his seat on the bench and strongly pleaded
on his son’s behalf, is not half so shock-
ing as are many other eases in which the
interested advocacy is secret, not open. In remote
country districts the honorary magistrate may at
times be a necessary evil. In town he is quite an
unnecessary evil and should be utterly abolished.
You might as well let a black snake bite through
the carotid artery of the goddess of Justice as
allow people to dispense “justice” to their per-
sonal or class friends or enemies and their brethren
in secret lodges. Petty court cases should be
heard by trained stipendiaries belonging to no
secret society, and Government and the public
should make heavy sacrifices to bring about such
a system.
The Bulletin has again to explain that
the term “National Ass” as applied by it to the
gang which seeks to endow every property-owner
with a double vote for Parliament, is not “short”
for “ National Association.” Ass, in this connec-
tion, really means ass, and nothing else. Ben-
jamin Franklin, in satirising the property-vote
theory, once said that if a man owned an ass (and
a vote on account of the ownership) in the tnorn-
ing, and the ass died at mid-day, in the evening
he would have no vote because he had no ass.
The vote, it was clear therefore, belonged to the
ass and not to the man. The “National Associa-
tions” and “Patriotic Leagues ” and “National
Defence Associations ” and other conspiracies to
defraud the people of their political birthright,
proposes endowing Ass-hood with votes at the
expense of Manhood. That is why the “National
Ass ’ is a name which has come to stay.

The Financial Scandals.
Never, probably, in the world’s history has an
equally young community suffered a commercial
relapse from over speculation and, in some
instances, rank swindling such as Victoria has
lately chronicled. Persons in high places—men
who were generally regarded as models of probity
and stability—are self-convicted jugglers with
other people’s money, who went in daringly for
rash speculations, little heeding that confiding
investors would have to bear the consequences of
probable failure. Permanent Building Societies
seem to have been “ permanent ” only so long as
they were not called upon to meet their obliga-
tions. Banks with high-sounding and compre-
hensive titles, by inordinate advances on insuffi-
cient security, or no security at all, have “shut up
shop ” only when the funds of their shareholders
have been dissipated. The list of widows and
infirm old men and women, of provident people
who had fondly hoped they were secure against
want, but who have been rendered dependent and
penniless by these lamentable departures from
integrity and honesty, is truly heart-rending. It
may be asked what has led to this deplorable state
of things ? Can it be innate wickedness in the
executives of the various institutions at fault?
For the sake of human nature, we will not credit
it. We would rather incline to the opinion that
the ruin has been caused by a baseless sense of
security—by that blind faith in the doctrine of
chance which prompts the almost insolvent
gambler to have one more throw of the dice, one
more hazard of all that is left in the forlorn hope
of retrieving all that had gone. This false sense
of security unfortunately extends to the considera-
tion of more important questions than mere
wealth. The advance of the crisis in one’s life is
unfelt or disregarded—we feel secure in the fact
that a state of good health has been enjoyed—
that trifling pain in the side or back is overlooked.
We have no precedent for personal disease, and
therefore it is impossible to create one. Rash
reasoning this ! —this over-speculation on the
health of the past taken as guarantee for the well-
being of the future—yet how common it is. Now
we give a truth so trite as to have become almost
an axiom. Kidney trouble is the primary occasion
of the greater proportion of known diseases. The
symptoms are most insidious in their nature—
often imperceptible in relation to the organs men-
tioned, but generally manifested in other parts of
the body in the shape of headache, neuralgia,
rheumatism, urinary complaints, sleeplessness,
&c., &c. H. H. Warner & Co.’s Safe Cure is the
one disinterested liquidator of apparently hope-
lessly insolvent constitutions. It is an investment
that pays more than 20s. in the <£, and is likely
to continue to do so until the advent of the last
man.

A man who boarded an outgoing ocean
steamer at Circular Quay, Sydney, the other day,
just as the captain was farewelling his numerous
friends, noticed that the gallant mariner, a very
handsome fello\V indeed, not having time to be
more formal or to explain matters, enthusiastically
kissed every woman (and there Were over twenty
of them) who came to say good-bye. They couldn’t
have been his sisters, or sisters-in-law, or anything
of the kind, for they were all more or less good-
looking, and were of the most diverse shapes and
complexions. When a man has so tremendous
an amount of love to distribute at high-pressure
over so wide a surface, it is impossible for him to,
in each case, enter into detailed explanation.
Kiss ’em till you raise a blister and hug ’em hard;
you can do this in 30 sec., and it saves hours of
palaver.
The amusements at Melbourne Govern-
ment House on ball-nights are rigorously restricted
to indoor pastimes; flirtations in the spacious
grounds being sternly discouraged. There is but
one open door, and no pass-out checks are issued.
In Gov. Loch’s time couples used to wander where-
soever they pleased, and lose themselves on the
Yarra’s bank for whole evenings at a stretch.
But we have changed all that now. Hopey, per-
haps, has more experience in the ways of men
and maids, or, again, the W.C.T.U. may beat the
bottom of it; but probably the escapades of those
frisky high-class dames caused this' step to be
taken.

A very well-known Australian medico is
caught on bird-lime. He married a pretty Aus-
tralienne some time ago. Now his first wife, mar-
ried in England, threatens to move legally, failing
plenty of backsheesh.
Glad news for the Rupertian branch of the
family ! “ Lady Carington has given birth to her
fifth daughter. ’ Her Majesty the Queen has ex-
pressed a desire to stand as godmother to the
infant.”

The time-expired Kanakas are settling
down and marrying in Moreton Bay. They easily
obtain work at 15s. per week, evicting the white
men wholesale. Half-caste children are gradually
becoming as plentiful as blackberries. Many go
to the kirk regularly and affect to be beastly
religious. #
Bartlett, M.P., who was summoned before
Adelaide Police Court on December 9 for the
maintenance of an illegitimate child, was defended
by Kingston, Q.C. He escaped the snare laid for
him and left the place “ without a stain on his
character.” He even had costs awarded him.
The awkward baby was born six years ago, but
action was not taken till last month, and then it
was initiated by the Destitute Board, and not by
the mother, who was in Mr. Bartlett’s employ for
a fortnight in December, 1886, but had not seen
him either before or since. “We shall none of us
be safe soon !” said Kingston, Q. 0., with well-
simulated horror.

She was a solitary teacher in a lonely
N.S.W. bush school, and the inspector called to
hold the usual school examination. When school
was dismissed, he turned his attention to the
teacher, and examined her quite closely. Then,
evidently satisfied with the inspection, he drew
her to his fatherly bosom, kissed her tenderly,
cocked his hat on his left ear, sighed deeply, and,
asking the way to the nearest pub., vanished.
The pretty teacher is wondering if all this is part
of the official routine.

Speaker Bent, of Victoria, as a councillor
of Brighton, “heartily endorses” a proposal to

The Imperial Hotel, Blue Mountains
(N.S.W.), burnt down the other day, was a
hostelry with a history. It was built by the
original seed land-boomer of modern days, Father
Deeming, who spent all his own and his sister’s
money in wild-cat schemes, and then made himself
scarce*

Many habitues of Sydney Town Hall
festivities regret the re-election of Mayor Manning.
When a return ball was given to the Mayor those
who had enjoyed his hospitality were invited to
join in. Numbers of them refused, and their

by one of the return-ball promoters.

The Melbourne P.O. authorities aro
getting aggressively virtuous since Dr. Bevan
accused them of connecting telephones to the Par-
liamentary bagnios of Lonsdale-street. A well-
known medico has had his instrument cut off for
sending the word “ Damn ” across the wires.

Victoria has inaugurated a system of
cremation by burning the remains of Gee Tie, a

Mr Arthur Way, ill a paper read before
the Melbourne Shakespeare Society, demonstrated
that Christianity is responsible for the existing
prejudice against red hair. Worshippers of Thor
venerated crushed-strawbetry-hued hair. Chris-
tianity overthrew this small deity, and brought all
his institutions into contempt. We object to red-
headed girls on religious principles.

Traversing Sir Edwin Arnold’s statement
that the Japanese girls regard chastity of body as
a matter of choice, not of virtue, and, placing
fidelity of mind higher, are ready to sell them-
selves for the sake of their parents, “Faustine,”
in Sydney D.T., says that: —
All this is very startling to decorous British minds.
Even the two or three men I have met who have lived in
Japan were shocked. They said they were longing to get
back there again ; but that, of course, was because they
wanted to do good to the poor benighted creatures they
pitied so much.
Isn’t the innuendo about these longing male
friends just a little

In Melbourne Supreme Court, in a very
fishy case, the other day, a beautiful lady dumb-
founded Dr. Madden, Q.C., by assuming too
much knowledge. She was describing the passage
in a bijou cottage where the learned counsel had
never been. She called him “Doctor,” and told
him how a certain room opened on to the corridor.
“You know, Doctor,” she explained petulantly.
“Indeed, madam, I do not; I have never had the
honour ! ” And then everybody laughed, and the
anecdote was trotted out about old Aarons meeting
a very ladylike person in a railway-carriage and
calling at her house at her special invitation to see
the chrysanthemums, and then the next day the
alleged husband called and borrowed <£6 from
him, and all was forgiven.

Government officials are prohibited from
receiving (without permission) purses of sovereigns
and testimonials when being transferred. But
the bridge is got over by the handing of the
souvenir to Mrs. G-uv’menter. _ Lately, the pro-
moter of a N.Q. testimonial cautiously interviewed
the lady—“ ’Ow will yer take it, marm? Tools?
Plate? Halbums ! Or sovs.?” “I prefer it in
sovereigns, thank you, as my husband can accept
a present from me.” And so it fell out. Which
reminds us of a case, somewhat 'opposite. The
lady wanted jewellery. “ But yer carn’t hev
joolery.” “Why not?” “ ’Ow’s yer ’usband a-
going to pay his lickcr score ter me if you don’t
take it in sovereigns? ’’ “ My husband’s personal
debts are not my concern.” “ ’Ow would yer like
me to summin him for refreshments supplied, an’
beds, an’ meals, an’ osses an’ traps, an’ ’e sup-
posed ter be chummy alius at ’ome with you ?
The lady “took it in sovs.” —or, rather, agreed to
accept it in sovs., and feelingly responded on be-
half of an empty purse.
The N.Q. Chinese lottery business was
supposed to have been put down by the police.
The latest development, however, is that a £2O-

The surrender of ex-bank-manager Ben-
nett, who got away from Paddington, Sydney*
three years ago, leaving behind a £IO,OOO to
£IB,OOO shortage, and who, though believed to
haVe cleverly escaped from Australia, has all the
time been located in a Sydney suburb, incites The
Bulletin tp several remarks. Firstly, that when
your “smart” detective has no letters from a
man’s Wife or girl to “steam” in the post-office
he is as helpless as a legless man without crutches.
Secondly, when an absconder dyes his skull-thatch
red he completely baffles the world, which contains
no one (not even a detective) base enough to
believe that any man could be so ruffianly as to
voluntarily endow himself with ginger hair.
Thirdly, that Bennett—who hadn’t a shilling
when he gave himself up—is, after all, a had
business man. Knowing that there was a £SOO
reward for his arrest he should have got a friend
to deliver him up to justice (the justice which
gave Abigail five years and let off arch-fiend
Nathan with nine months) to claim the blood-
money for the benefit of the devoted wife who has
kept her husband’s secret while the world was
being raked in search of him.

Opals ai’e supposedly unlucky, yet the
jockey who rode last Melbourne Cup winner wore
an opal breast-pin, and the man who won the

Editor Bulletin,—
In the early part of ’92
a youth steals a post-
letter, pleads guilty and
gets six months. Friends
would have paid almost
any money : but no op-
tion In October an-
other official tried, found
guilty of stealing one
post-letter, sentenced to
two years and eleven
months. Had sick wife
and a child, and no
friends at all. In Decem-
ber a well-connected
official is arrested for
stealing two post-letters
—may have stolen hun-
dreds. M.P. sees pre-
siding “Justice,” and
P.M.G. winks the other
eye. Press squared.
Pleads guilty. Justice
shuffles, says awfully
naughty young man.
Fined £2O, which he can
well afford to pay, con-
sidering how he has been
adding to his official
income and the extent to
which he is in people’s
secrets. Post-letters are
supposed to be sacred
while in P.O. In Eng-
land this heavy “swell”
would have got five years
certain. In Victoria he
would nave got four
years, and in N.S.W.
say three years. These
are good examples for
other light-fingered “gen-
tlemen ” in the P.O.—
Down .South.
The snigger at Cairns, N.Q., is against a
Majah and 16 mashahs who dolled and perfumed
themselves to go out to the expected 8.1. steamer,
because they had heard that six lovely girls
were aboard that boat, en route from Britain to
Australian “ lady-helpdom.” Several hours of
tossing about in a small steamer and —only five
chawbacon farm-labourers as a reward ! Nausea.

That is a gruesome story (the subject of a
magisterial inquiry) of a Brisbane hospital warder
and a dying patient. Another patient talks of
having seen two punches in the pit of the stomach
bring on a speedy death-rattle ; the other side s
storv is that the old man with the fractured thigh
fought fiercely and was simply made to lie down.
Anyhow, fancy even a slight scuffle between a
strong, healthy warder and a dying man ! Ugh !

Fox, a Victorian painter, has just ended
his six years’ Parisian study, and returned to
Melbourne, with a number of his works, which
rank him with Longstaff, Altson, Streeton, and
the others who have done so well. Here is another
reminder of the extraordinary neglect of French
art by the authorities of Melbourne Gallery,
although every one of their pupils goes for study
to Paris, the head-quarters of art.

Victorian artists shook their feathers and
looked proud the other day at the announcement
that John Mather had been appointed a trustee
of the local National Gallery. This was followed
by the cable news that little J. Forde Patterson
was working up an exhibition of Australian
nictures in London.

“HIS DEATH ECLIPSED THE GAIETY OF
NATIONS."
Thej’ come and go, these jesters gay,
Their lives are short and merry ;
I?hey have their fling and fade away;
Old Charon, grim, and gaunt, and gray
Rows Leslie o’er the ferry*
A tear drops in the flowing howl,
Our solemn toast is “ Rest his soul 1"
Speak kindly of the fallen star.
Whose art was ever jolly*
We mind the time he “ bought the bar ”
And lightly puffed from big cigar
A cloud of fleeting folly.
The other day the World awoke
To find him vanished, like th'e smoke*
He might have filled a foremost place
In true dramatic story ;
He might have gone a slower pace,
And lasted longer in the race
For evanescent glory.
But there—how many graves are green
With raem’ries of what might have been !
And many lives of brighter men
Than he have been more barren--
For thousands, counted by the ten,
Recall the melting moments when
They laughed at Fred, and Farren.
He earned the kindly epitaph—
“ A man who raised a real laugh.”
Heigho ! how long since Nell and Fred,
Disported here so madly ?
A year or two—and one is dead,
And one, they say, lies sick a-bed,
Her day is closing sadly.
What prophet ventured to foretell
This gloomy end of Fred, and Nell?
The game goes on, and people new
Are blowing burlesque bubbles
(Though smaller than the others blew)
And watching them provides for you
Distraction from your troubles,
But hands and feet would fain encore
The pair who will appear no more.
GONE AHEAD!
The bard he paces Melbourne streets,
His locks are long and lank ;
In musing tone he oft repeats
Those words of tailor Frank—
Of Frank, whose heart for Matthew T).
Exceedingly hath bled;
And still the bard declines to see
Where things have gone ahead.
The bard he smells the city fair
And sniffs financial stink ;
He notes fat, loafing persons there
Whose hearts are black as ink,
Who make a composition while
Their betters want for bread,
The devil take the windbags vile
Who blew the land ahead !
The bard has heard of money “ made,”
Or stolen (all the same),
And freely spent; ’twas “good for trade,”
And brought the robbers tame.
The champagne days are vanished now,
Like phantoms have they fled,
And taxes tell the toilers how
The country “went ahead.”
A curse upon the buildings tall
With scores of rooms To Let,
The buildings tall whose owners all
Live well on “ paper ” debt.
A curse on “ farthings in the pound,"
Of which you’ve lately read ;
There’s rot throughout the land renowned
For having “ gone ahead.”
They echo in the bardling’s ear,
Those words of tailor Frank,
But still he cannot drop a tear
For rogues who break a bank.
The bard he toddles home, and when
He dozes off in bed
He dreams of choking many men
Who sent the land “ ahead.”

M.L.O. (N.S.W.); “Ido
not feel strong about the
abolition of plural voting.

able lawyer has been irl

years and is still “con-

In the presence of
between six and 10 mem-
bers—the latter number
never being exceeded
S.A. Assembly recently
put through two bills
aggregating over 300
clauses, in less than two
hours. There Were more
legislators in the smok-
ing, card, and refresh-
ment-rooms than in the
chamber, whilea majority
of the House was peace-
fully at home in bed.
When the general
public has forgotten that
it’was the Shiels Govern-
ment that “sacked’*
Speight, that put a penny
on all railway - tickets,
and that endeavoured to
pass the Pascoe Vale rail-
way job on an almost
bankrupt province, the
one fact that it was they
who strenuously opposed
the bringing of the alleged
bank-looters to trial will
stand out conspicuously
as a monument of their
interested inaction.
When the culprits are
safely housed in gaol—
for it seems incredible
that even the protecting
arm of a Premier can
entirely prevent, however
long it may delay, that
consummation—the pub-
lic will more generally
realise the enormity of
the offences which it was
endeavoured to cloak,
and the Shiels Govern-
ment will go down to
posterity associated with
such recollections of fraud
and corruption as will effectually prevent any
prominent member of it regaining power when
once this opportunist Ministry has been super-
seded.
At Hughenden (N.Q.) was seen the other
day a team of 25 billy-goats drawing a cookie’s
load of two tons.
The S.A. Government has a jhuraorous
Way of trying a blackfellow for murder. He is
hauled before a magistrate, charged, and evidence
given. Then he is asked what he has to say.
Nigger (real N.T. case): “Me no killem first
time; boy killem first time; him close up dead |
me killem little bit.” A confession sufficient to
Imng even a Matt. Davies ! Then the beak com
mits the nig. for trial. At the superior court the
Crown mercifully appoints a lawyer to defend
him ! —after he has owned up in full and with
that owning appearing on the court records!
Why not appoint a lawyer to defend him before
his untutored mind is cheated out of a confession
that makes the lawyer a useless fee-snaveller ? Or
else let the beak take him outside at once and
brain him. “ Much less Christian ?” Much more
merciful 1
Minister R. E. O’Connor’s reply to a depu-
tation from Newcastle, asking the commutation
of the sentences of the Broken Hill strike-leaders
was type-written. Which recalls the fact that
when the historical Mount Rennie deputation
waited on Gov. Carington, the latter immediately
read out his answer from a MS. prepared before-
hand. “ But, your Excellency,” ejaculated Dailey
to the Baron, “ that has no reference whatever to
the arguments we have advanced.” Carington
angrily put up his hand, with “ I do not wish to
be interrupted.” “I despise such a man; not
only has he no heart—he has no brain, which is a
greater crime on such an occasion,” said Dailey
subsequently to the present writer.
Trickett, who in N.S.W. nominee Legis-
lative Council moves the emasculation of the Elec-
toral Bill by the double-enfranchisement of soul-
less Property, was formerly a member of the
popularly-elected Assembly. Would he, if still a
Member of Assembly, dare to publicly declare
in favour of balancing a man’s life against an
allotment? Never! Where is the Member of
Assembly, out of the whole 141, who dare stand
up and make such a declaration ? There is not
one. The N.S.W. House of Kidney-fits says the
One-man-one-vote question was not decided by
the electors at last general election. A fact: Only
one solitary candidate, out of all who stood for
election, dared to oppose the bedrock democratic
principle. His name was Burns, and he was re-
jected.
The Newcastle (N.S.W.) wharf labourers,
now on strike, relied to a certain extent upon the
co-operation of the steamers’ engineers. As cloth-
ing specially designed to resist the extreme cold
is never worn by the mutton-stowers, a few extra
turns of the refrigerating machinery would have
driven the hardiest blackleg to the upper deck.
Instructions were, however, issued to the engineers
not to reduce the temperature below a certain
minimum.
A CLINCHER.
QUEENSLAND LIAR : “Why, you N.S.W. chaps don’t know what heat
is. You want to go to Queensland to feel heat.”
NEW SOUTH WALES LIAR : “Well, I dunno. Some places down here
I’ve seen it 130 in the shade for days and nights at a stretch.”
QUEENSLAND LIAR: “Hundred and thirty in the shade! Why, up
on the station, we’ve had it 150 in the water-bag at four
o’clock in the morning!”
About the only reprieve Premier Griffith
(Q.) has assented to was that of murderer Johnny

Kanaka.
In Prussia it has been found that the
average duration of a Jewish life is five years

“ How easy it is for certain presumptuous persons
to orate who do not hesitate to rush in where the
very angels themselves with bated breath tread
with gentle footsteps slow.
The brig Velocity, one of the last of the
old Tasmanian whalers, was destroyed with gum
cotton the other day. The ship was built in
England in 1807 and for long was engaged in the
West African and West Indian trades —carrying,
it is said, many a load of—well, they call them
“blackbirds” in Queensland—for the Cuban
planters.
The present Kaiser, ever since his acces-
sion, has been steadily weeding out the old veteran
generals of the German army. The process is
now about complete. The great military machine
is run by a crowd of gaudy young officers, most of
whom never saw war ; and when the next trouble
arises they and the Kaiser may be very like the
tame bear that tries to drive a locomotive, and
can’t stop it again.
Cowley, Minister for Lands (Q.), has
resurrected one of MTlwraith’s old swindlecates.
Mac. wept over the ruins of Rockhampton, and
urges them to save their city by agitating for a
land-grant railway thence to Port Alma at the
mouth of the Eitzroy. If constructed, the
swindlecate will own the deep-water terminus of
the central line, a 350-mile State-railway. The
channels of the Pitzroy are being allowed to silt
up, for economy ' sake, you know. The swindle-
cate hopes to eat at a gulp 350 miles of rails
sleepers, carnages, locomotives, stations, &c.’
built at the expense of the confiding taxpayer
and fix its own price for the feed.

He came to love with a foul love,
When I loved her with a fair,

They are buried together there.
And sometimes I sit in my garden and think,

“ Ah ! dear God ! may we not pluck one rose
But we mangle our hands with thorns.”

“ George Mackay ” (Maoriland): We adore
originality, so here are your verses :
“ THU FAREWELL SMOKE BEFORE WE GO.
“ Thiet of the modern Providence—the guinea Omni-
potent—
Tallow-clothed plutocrat, with the long, cruel, tentacled
paw,
And the yawning abyss-paunch and the bottomless pit of
a maw,
Though the world and its crushed soul are in the shadow
of your claw,
In the roaring social furnace hearts are heated white with
wrath,
Which Time’s blows shall beat and shape to countless
swords to lay you low.
Blind Justice won’t be drugged for ever: sit still and
think of this
When you puff the weed-reek from the last cigar before
you go.
“Able-bodied fellow-toilers, able-minded men and true,
Nature’s filial sons and daughters, helping Nature in the
fight,
In the world-wide social battle with the darkness and the
night,
For the cause of Truth and Justice and the triumph of
the Right,
Ere the silent sleep be on us, ere we hear Time swish his
scythe;
Ere our souls pack up and bundle, w'hen the pulse beats
faint and slow,
Our pet pipe we’ll fill and to the cause the fragrant
incense blow—
When we sit and dream over the farewell pipe before we
go.
“We are the crew of the old Earth-ship and steer her
through the storm,
And tho’ our captains all are dead, ironed, murdered,
crucified,
Their charts ‘faked,’ we’ll reach some port beyond the
waters deep and wide.
Their restless spirits grasp our keel and the wreckers are
defied,
And when that port’s in sight our whole life in one big
quid we’ll chew,
And its dark, strong juice and weed upon th’ Eternal Sea
bestow.
Spray and coal may corn and grime our soul —that sea
will wash us clean !
Our last thoughts, what price? over the farewell quid
before we go !’*
■V (Tamworth): We are tired of such girls
•J.W. (Darhnghurst): Your bland inquiry about the
amount of Miss W.’s salary has been forwarded to that

-116 il 1 (kydney); Our private opinion is that he fell over
a shadow and broke his neck “ Junius ” (Norwood):
Ihe mere bald assertion that a shark was 80 feet long isn’t
humour. If it was, what a humorous thing the ichthyo-
saurus must have been, and how people would laugh at
his bones. .“The Pauper’’: If it wasn’t borrowed

female with the lime-light shining through her abbrevi-

suicide is a dismally common story . ..“1.M.A.” (New-

that it is like being measured for a happy smile...

Manly, fair Manly, loveliest retreat,
Here, secluded ’mid thy heights, Hygeia reigns complete.
“W. Crompton” (M.): “Crossing the River” under

is a meaningless phrase. He isn’t necessarily any bolder
than the dauntless cook or the valiant individual who
goes round with the tar-p0t.... “D.W.”: One verse
deserves to be written in letters of blazing ham-fat on
walls of fire:
And o’er us eternal, this Being infernal ;
Eyes blazing with love-light of rapine and death.

ment of cellars, ghosts, hidden wmlls, mad girls, corpses,
spectres, illicit whisky, and a man named'Bill—who, as
hereinbefore-mentioned, has been abolished “Julius”;
“ Hail to each fair moonbeam.” That’s enough. “ Hail,”
like “ Wot ho,” is the interjection of a barren mind.
“Childe Harold”; “Once more there where they’ll
meet again so oft before ” is the worst mixed sentiment
we ever met with “Victorian”: Try to find anew
synonym for “the prevailing depression.” It is an
aggravating phrase.... “Oswald Hugo”: The man who
is haunted by a face seen in a previous state of existence
is cheap, stereotyped mysticism. Dreams of that sort
are selling now at seven for 6d. .. “New Australia”:
Perhaps you are not aware that the banks of a river are
not necessarily a well-watered region. You can fall from

“Herr Rasmussen’s, the celebrated Danish Herbalist,
well-known Herbal Remedies have been the means of per-

numerous testimonials will prove. ’’—Sydney Bulletin.
“ Herr Rassmussen has shown us some highly compli-
mentary Testimonials which he has received certifying to
important cures effected by his remedies.”—Sydney Evening
News.

ANNA RUPPERT
AND WHAT SHE SAYS.
WHAT is more hideous than a face covered with
moth freckles, pimples, wrinkles, redness, oily-
ness, etc. ? Is it not, then, necessary to do all in our
power to remove these blemishes? It is NOT vanity,
but NICETY. Mrs. ANNA RUPPERT’S world-
renowned SKIN TONIC does this work according to
Nature. It cleanses the pores, leaves the skin free for
impure matter to exude. Is it harmful ? You may as
well say, Is it injurious to wash your scalp and remove
the dandruff? for removing the outer cuticle is of the
same nature. ■
It is not necessary to be confined to the house. Use
moderately, and you will suffer no inconvenience. Tell
your husband, your physician ; explain to them it is a tonic, a medicine—not a cosmetic, not a powder;
that it is not to enamel, but to cure you; that it is perfectly harmless, free from arsenic, lead,
bismuth, etc.; that ANNA RUPPERT uses no acid, not one drop; that ANNA RUPPERT’S
own face is proof; that she uses it on her own daughter. Would she do this if hurtful? Then, ladies
why hesitate? Surely a woman who stands to-day UNEQUALLED, with NO RIVAL-a woman
who sells more SKIN lONIC than any article offered to-day in the market for the complexion, and
can prove her assertion would not dare to risk so honourable a reputation as she has gained by selling
you a nostrum. World-renowned SKIN TONIO needs no more convincing evidence of its efficacy
and purity than has already been given to the public long since by living examples.

Legally Qualified and Registered by the Governing
Medical Board of New South Wales,
This eminent Specialist, Founder, and Chief
Surgeon of the long-established and favourably,
known Dispensary that now bears his name, re-
ceived his medical education and surgical training
in the leading colleges and hospitals of Europe.
He has devoted a life- time to the study of
Nervous Complaints.
He has by profound research thoroughly investi-
gated their origin, traced their deadly sources and
insidious dissemination, and ascertained the surest
and safest methods by which they may be eradi-
cated; with these widely recognised qualifications
combined with unswerving faithfulness to his
patients, he has during his practice, extending
over FORTY YEARS, attained a well-deserved
pre-eminence in their treatment. His practice
embraces diseases which probably cause more un-
happiness than any other class of troubles that
afflict mankind.

At Sydney California Club, last Saturday
night, two men met (in the presence of the police) to
bang and disfigure each other for a small amount of
money, and Alexander Stewart, the worst-banged man of
the pair, died. Arrests for manslaughter have been
made, and the moral press looks with a grieved and sur-
prised expression upon the incident, and says that it is a
Wrong Thing. The grief may be natural enough, but the
surprise is certainly quite uncalled for. When two men
meet to smash each other “to a finish”—which simply
means till one of them is half, or more than half, defunct
—it is quite probable that the loser may become, by mis-
adventure, a little more defunct than was intended, and
may stay that way. The principal cause for surprise is
that such an accident doesn’t happen more frequently.
Also, the legal aspect of the case is hard to understand.
The police are present at these savage assaults, and never
interfere unless one individual seems to have half his
swollen head in the grave, therefore they are either
accessories to the crime, or else it isn’t a crime at all—
up to the moment when they interfere. In the present
case the row stopped the moment _ the police
intervened, but Stewart died from injuries which
he had previously received under the authority
and supervision of the force. Therefore The Bul-
letin wants to know why the police haven’t been
arrested as well as the manager of the establishment and
six or eight other onlookers. Or, if the police were acting
under instructions from the Government, then why hasn’t
the Government been arrested.

One prize-fighter—or a dozen prize-fighters for
that matter—isn’t much loss to the community. And his
death presents one bright feature which he never pre-
sented when he was alive—it will probably put an end to
professional pugilism locally. The mangling of one’s
fellow-man for a few pounds in cash is a degrading busi-
ness, as well as an outrage on the picturesque and the
beautiful. The average bruiser isn’t lovely When
whole and unsmashed ; when freshly licked, and
painfully removing his bloated head to the
nearest hiding-place, he is a blot on the landscape
and a sin against all the rules of perspective. The Romans
did things better in the days of the Oatsars ; they had the
fallen gladiator killed and dragged away with a hook
before his ugliness had time to soak into the public
comprehension. #
The latest cablegrams concerning “Wells, the

dash out his brains against the wall of his dungeon.

Rowdy Lord Ailesbury recently cwushed the
secretary of the stand-offish Ist Zingari (London) Cricket
Club. Ailesbury drove up to the Club ground with the
precious colours of that institution attached to his hat,
and the secretary was told off to enquire by what right
the outcast nobleman assumed the emblem of a club he
didn’t belong to. Then came the cwusher. The secretary
was reminded that a former Marquis of Ailesbury had
been humbly requested to allow the Ist Zingari to adopt
his family colours, a favour which he “ graciously
granted.” There’s a moral to be found in this yarn.

“IT IS THREE THOUSAND MILES
LONG.”
We allude to the great Mississippi River in
America. For hundreds of miles of its course it
is yellow with the earth which the swift current
has torn from its banks. Probably the Missis-
sippi bears constantly in solution ground enough
to make many a rich farm, though the amount is,
of course, greater at times of flood. Thus, for
drinking, and even for washing, the water of the
Mississippi must first be purified.
It is the same with anything which either for
appearance or utility is in some way thrown out
of character. For instance, the blood in our body
is a river. From the heart to the extremities it is
of a bright red colour, but on its return through
the veins it is dark and sluggish. The reason is
that when it starts from.the heart it has just been
purified, and when it comes back it is loaded with
all sorts of refuse matter it has picked up in its
journey. In other words, the blood—which is
only food fully digested—carries life on its red
current and brings away disease and death on its
dark one.
Speaking of her own condition at a period about
six years since, a woman writes that her skin
gradually became first yellow and then of a saffron
colour. Connected with this she experienced
several symptoms of illness. She had more or less
pain at the sides and considerable difficulty in
breathing. Her appetite, previously good, began
to fail, and after eating comparatively little, there
was much distress in the region of the stomach.
There was an attendant loss of energy, both of
mind and body, and she felt tired, languid, and
weak.
Now we must observe that in ease of natural
fatigue from labour or any exertion rest is an
unfailing remedy. Sleep and relaxation renew
our powers. But there is a kind of fatigue which
rest does not relieve—for which the Angel of
Sleep bears no healing on his wings. What vile
counterfeit is it ?
She adds : “ I finally took to my bed and was
visited by a doctor, who said my liver was wrong,
and that I had jaundice. He gave me medicine,
but as it had no good effect he advised me to go
to the hospital. As I objected to this, he said I
might try a change of air and see what that would
do for me. So I gave up my place and went to
my home at Fairford, in Gloucestershire. Fail-
ing to obtain any benefit from the change, I con-
sulted another physician, who attended me for
some time, but I grew no better. Whatever I did
I could not recover my strength, and my friends
thought I was in a decline.
“I did not eat enough to feed a bird, and began
to despair of ever recovering my health. With
many ups and downs in the way of feeling, and of
fear and hope, I lingered along until July, 1890,
when an acquaintance recommended me to try
Mother Seigel’s Syrup. Indeed, so much was I
impressed with what was said about this medicine
that I sent my niece four miles to procure a bottle
of it. After taking the contents I felt better. A
weight seemed to be lifted from my chest, my
relish for food returned, and by degrees I found
myself in every way stronger. I will conclude by
saying that after having used two bottles more of
the Syrup I was able to return to Birmingham
quite well, and have had no signs of the ailment
since. It is only just to mention that I feel better
now than I have done for many years, and had I
sooner known of Mother Seigel’s Syrup I should
have avoided an amount of suffering and misery
which it saddens me even to look back upon.”
The lady referred to is Miss Sarah Hawkes, of
the “Lion Inn,” Longmore-street, Birmingham.
That yellow or saffron colour of the blood was
caused by the failure of the liver to secrete, or
take away, the bile from the blood. Remaining
in the blood it was carried to all parts of the body,
and necessarily showed itself through the skin in
the ghastly hue she names.
Understand, please, that the bile, useful to help
move the bowels, is a poison when in the blood.
The entire malady of biliousness in all its forms
is a symptom of indigestion and dyspepsia, the
source of most of our aches, pains, and diseases.
It is no new thing to say that the success of
Mother Seigel’s Syrup in reviving the torpid
digestion, stimulating the liver, and thus purify-
ing the blood, sets it apart from all other medicines
as an article to be relied upon when the use of
ordinary drugs has been followed only by disap-
pointment. The blood holds the secret of life,
and this remedy keeps that ruby river clear and
clean.
Historian : “ Madame Roland was the
intimate enemy of Marie Antoinette. ”
A memorial service was held in a London
church on the anniversary of the death of W, H.
Smith. The world needed a reminder that the
successful book-stall proprietor had lived and died.
The moment a child is born, that moment
he begins to die. Beware of disease making in-
roads into the system. Probably one of the
earliest signs is slight dyspepsia which cannot be
attributed to errors in diet, want of, fresh air, &c.
It is a nervous kind of atonic dyspepsia, some-
times combined with acidity from liver sympathy.
There is not the same relish for food, and so relief
from this state is sought for in piquant relishes,
wine, or tea. Another symptom is an uneasy or
tired feeling about the head—fulness, it may be,
or sleeplessness, and stupidity, especially after
eating. The brow is often hot, so is the top of
the head, and the hand is pressed wearily across
the eyes. Life begins to lose its brightness ; then
things begin to go a trifle wrong, and there are
moments of peevishness and irritability. Low-
ness of spirits is succeeded by want of sleep.
There is danger ahead, if not, indeed, close at
hand, and happy is he who sees the signal in time.
Recourse should immediately be had to some
genuine tonic restorative which will restore the
consumed nervous tissue, and most probably
Clements Tonic is the best for this purpose, it
having had uniformly good results every time we
have seen it used. In oases of debility, nervous
prostration, bilious and nervous headaches,
anaemia, and all diseases arising from poorness
of blood and indigestion, Clements Tonic can be
used with confidence. It is not a quack remedy,
and, unlike other patent medicines, its proprietors
do not claim that it “will cure anything,” from
lock-jaw to bad spelling. But for cases of affec-
tions of the nervous and digestive systems it is
specially serviceable. No doubt of the merits of
the article can exist after a perusal of the evidence
of John Tippet, Esq., Glenrowan, Victoria, who
writeslt is a very pleasing duty for me to
convey to you the facts of the great benefit
that has accrued to me through taking Clements
Tonic. For the last two years I have suffered
very severely from indigestion, flatulence, and
I think every other horror appertaining there-
to, being subject to uneasiness and retching after
meals, especially after dinner, which meal I had
to discontinue altogether, the nasty sensation and
retching depressed me so much. I tried many of
the advertised cures without benefit, but on read-
ing of a similar case to my own cured by Clements
Tonic, I resolved to give the same remedy a trial,
and after taking three bottles the uneasy feeling
and retching were entirely cured, and I shall not
fail to make it known as widely as possible in the
Glenrowan district, where I reside, and trust it
may be the means of relieving others so afflicted.
On rising every morning my mouth would be stuck
together. I was advised to try' ■. I did so,
bub only got temporary relief. I had made up
my mind to go to Melbourne to see if I could be
cured. Being advised to try Clements Tonic, I
did, and now, thank God, I am twice the man.
Night after night I have lain in my bed and never
shut my eyes, and would be more tired when I
got up than when I went to bed. The bad taste
has left my mouth and I feel quite a different
man, thanks to Clements Tonic. —I am, sir, yours
respectfully, John Tippet, Glenrowan, Victoria.
It is the ambition of the great Mutual
Store, situate in Flinders-street, Melbourne, to
embody every trade and industry under the sun,
and to supply every possible want' of a civilised
community. It has got very near to the realisa-
tion of this ambition. The big building opposite
the railway station now contains a grocery, wine
and spirit store, drapery, tailoring, boot and shoe,
and mercery departments, wood and coal depot,
furniture, china, glass, carpet, ironmongery, sta-
tionery, and fancy goods emporiums, grain and
produce store, chemist’s shop, livery and bait
stables, and department for of surgical
appliances. When a savings bank has been added
it will be difficult to imagine what more the heart
of man can yearn after —unless it be a “tote.”
Dear Bulletin,— Re “A. J. Miller,” supposed

him as being perfectly straight. On the faith of this I

dodge in Brisbane in 1891, and that the victims of his
bogus sweep wrecked his office. Wallace is a short, stout,
fair man, hook-nosed, with florid complexion, no whiskers

He Bought a Horse.
“My dear,” began Mr. Cityman, as he entered
his suburban home the other evening in apparently
high spirits, “ I did a good stroke of business to-
day.” “Indeed! And what was that?” archly
inquired Mrs. C., with a well-meant though un-
successful attempt to appear interested. “Noth-
ing short of a dead bargain. I arn going to utilise
the old stable where the fowls are housed, and I
mean to ride into town every day. It will benefit
my health, and I won’t have to hang around the
streets waiting for a ’bus.” “So you have
bought a horse, then?” was the acid rejoinder.
“Of course I have; you don’t suppose I’d buy a
donkey, or a mule, or a dromedary, or a locomo-
tive, or ” “ Well,” broke in Mrs. C., in con-
ciliatory tones, “I didn’t know that you could
manage a horse, and besides I should have thought
” “Oh, certainly,” snapped out Mr. City-
man, “ you’re always thinking instead of making
sure. But when you see me coming in after
a rattling good canter you’ll change your tune.
I tell you this horse is a beauty, and no mistake,
quiet as a child, no vice about him, good pacer,
and warranted not to shy or cut up capers.”
Early the following morning the steed was
brought home and handed over, and the proud
owner, after several desperate tries, finally
succeeded in climbing into the saddle and set off
for town. There was no wind to speak of that day,
and a small boy on the wayside was frantically
endeavouring to persuade a recalcitrant kite into
a recognition that it was destined for a nobler
career than scraping up road metal, when a spry
horse and a perspiring, doubled-up equestrian
hove in sight. There was a busy, exciting time for
about three minutes during which the air was
filled with profanity and buttons and things, and
then a riderless horse might be seen ambling
peacefully down the road as if nothing had
happened. Mr. Cityman took the next ’bus home,
where he humbly submitted himself for repairs.
These his wife soon effected with the aid of a
valuable family remedy always kept in stock by
her. The next day a horse was advertised “for
sale, cheap,” and Mr. C., while distinctly dis-
claiming all desire to “make an advertisement of
himself,” felt bound to admit that his wife was
right again when she preached the doctrine that
St. Jacobs Oil, for the absolute relief and cure of
contusions, sprains, and bruises, knows no rival,

the manufacturers desire to call the attention of
station-owners and managers to the latest ex-
pression of opinion they have received as to the
efficacy of their
PATENT PHOSPHORISED WHEAT
in the
DESTRUCTION of RABBITS.
“To Messrs. Felton, Grimwade, and Co.,
Melbourne.
Dear Sirs, —
“ I am laying the Patent Phosphorised
Wiieat now, and have better grass than
any in the district, still the rabbits will
take it in preference to the grass.
“I cannot speak too highly of the wheat,
and have used it this last three seasons.
Last year I did more with four bushels
than I did by the expenditure of =£2oo in
carbon bisulph, and digging out. To
quote a neighbour’s opinion, it would be
cheap at a pound a bushel. I have given
samples to a number of persons in this
district, who will use it this coming
season.
“To conclude, there is only one way to
deal with the rabbit plague—by poison ;
all the exterminators and quack patents in
the colony, among which may be included
carbon bisulph., are not worth the tins or
cases they are forwarded in. The reason
is obvious—the time required and cost.
“The use of your wheat should be made
compulsory by Government, and the
rabbits would vanish.
“ Yours truly,
(Signed)
“14/11/92.”

We Claim for Our
PATENT PHOSPHORISED WHEAT;
That it is Highly Poisonous.— By our pro-
cess of Manufacture it is impossible for one grain
to receive more phosphorous than another. Per-
fect uniformity of strength is thus attained!
Rabbits Eat it Greedily, as by this Patent
Process the wheat is made highly palatable.
Durability. —Each grain being encased in a
transparent and impervious envelope, it stands
exposure to the weather almost any length of time
without lessening its poisonous quality.
BTo Danger of Eire. —Careful experiments have
been made with wheat phosphorised to SIX
TIMES the strength of our wheat, and it cou'd
not be made to fire.

AN AUSTRALIAN LABOUR POEM, BY ALARIO.
It is the sin of sins
That one must ask another’s leave to toil,
And Labour, oft must starve when wanting work.
It is the wrong of wrongs that any man
Should seek to profit from another’s toil,
And Living Labour, made in God’s own image, be
Considered but a CHATTEL to be bought and
sold—
To-day be hired and to-morrow cast aside.
Not less a bitter wrong it is, that he
Who owns the instruments creating wealth
Can starve his brother into bondage,
But thinly veiled when masked with Freedom’s
name.
For Capital, more strong than Governments,
Holds arbitrary power of life and death,
And for a mere caprice, a trivial fault,
Or to entrench itself ’gainst glut, or loss,
May close the factory, shut down the mine,
And bar the means of work against the serfs
Whose toil created them, and who—if right
Were done—would own them still.
And thus the chattel slave of olden time
Become the wages-serf of modern days.*
Though He, who never rests, but ever steers
The stately caravels, whoso silent keels
Plough heaven’s blue immensity, decreed
The saoredness of Labour, made the earth
A workshop which our toil must sanctify,
This sacred Living Labour is esteemed of far
Less worth than Capital, a thing inanimate.
Humanity, which ever lives and learnsf
And carries in its bosom all the hope
Of progress for our race in future years,
Is valued less than minted gold ;
And men before the Golden Calf of Capital
Bow down like serfs, like serfs adore.
Whene’er depression comes, Humanity
Must first be starved, or turned adrift,
Before the “ sacred rights of Capital ”
To interest and profits are denied.
’Tis strange the “ sacred rights of Labour ” are
So seldom talked about—the right to earn
A sustenance for wife and child, to build
A cottage home and live a human life.
For God, we’re told, so loved accumulated wealth
That He created all the vast expanse
Of this revolving globe for Capital alone,
And then created man, its humble serf,
To minister unto its luxuries. +
Upon the anvil of Despair, bedewed
With sweat and tears of toiling multitudes,
Must Labour forge the mighty dollar for its use.
And swell its hoards while toiling millions starve.
Thus Capital neglects its sacred aim,
To be the heart of Industry and pump
The life-giving corpuscles of warm blood
Through all its veins ; to foster, not exploit.
But, like the octopus, it spreads abroad
Its suckers, seeking whom they may devour.
And Interest is an anti-social force
Which rends the golden bonds of brotherhood —
That sacred brotherhood of man Christ preached—
And crushes Labour to support in luxury
The few who never toil, nor spin.
Grim Architect of Poverty, it gives
To wealth created in the time of Noah
Immortal life and power in perpetuity
To suck the veins of Living Labour ;
Nor ever shares the loss arising from
Vicissitudes of seasons, drought and flood.
In plenteous years,
When Nature whispers to the bursting seed
Awake ! put forth each tender leaf and shoot
And robe the earth in loveliness ;
In cloth of gold where waves the rip’ning corn,
In mingled green and gold where zephyrs sport
Among the tasselled maize; and richest green
Where over hill and dale the pasture spreads
Its rolling billows; deck its breast with siiips
Where daisy-craft unfurl their painted sails of pink
And white and gaily ride at anchorage,
Moored side by side with clover blooms that toss
And heave whene’er the fitful summer winds
Bend low the supple masts;—then and then
Alone may Capital claim interest
In fair proportion as its uses tend
To raise the harvest. Most unjust it is
It Capital demand its pound of flesh
In years of iron skies, or devastating floods,
When all the earth is one vast wilderness.
In seasons such as these must Labour bow
His humble head to Capital for bread,
And one by one the smiling homesteads fall
Into grim Shyleck’s greedy maw, and then
The independent yoemen cease to be.
And ev’n the mind of man
That, like the eagle, seeks to soar and scan
The whole circumference of this round earth
And all the worlds beyond—e’en that
Is shackled. Who may articulate the wrongs
Of his dumb, suffering brother in words that burn
Like living coals, made incandescent with
The sense of grievous wrong, but Capital,
Wide-minded Capital, will boycott him
And call him “ agitator,’’ worse than thief,
And sentence him to starve while tantalised
By looking at the wealth he may not earn ?
But still each one must fight as Nelson fought,
His blind eye on Expediency, his eagle gaze
On that far-distant signal-post in heaven
Where Duty’s signal flies. Nor cease till Death’s
Cold fingers run the shot-torn ensign down
And waft the hero-craft into those silent ports
Where, after turmoil, there is peace.
, What tongue can voice
The children’s wrongs when Capital kidnaps
Them from their play, and forces them to toil
And sweat in grimy factories before
Their lives, like tender buds, can well have spread
Their opening petals to the breeze?
The Arab slaver well may smile and deem
His crime but as a sin most fashionable
Whed “ Christian gentlemen ” can interweave
In spools of yarn the threads of children’s lives.
The thread is long, for God upon the reel of life
Spun years a full three score and ten,
But factory shuttles flay the bobbin bare
In life’s young spring, in reckless greed for gold.
And then a little starveling finds a grave
Among the many nameless graves which mark
The paupers’ only resting-place on earth.
Ah ! once I dreamed
That Capital, in lieu of human serfs,
Essayed to harness eagles to its oar.
The harness was of finest silk, embroidered o’er
With precious stones, and decked with waving
plumes.
But they, the free-born wanderers of the sky,
Repelled with scorn the gilded chains and scoffed
At wages-slavery, “Harness the winds,” they
cried,
“That whip the ocean surges into foam,
Bridle the mighty coursers of the deep
That lash their snow-white crests against the
crags;
And cage the hurricane; but leave the eagle free.”
Yet one of them, ensnared by cunning wiles,
Was harnessed to the car. In vain it lashed its
wings
And tore the galling chains with beak and claws.
Then realising that it was indeed enslaved,
It drove its beak into its mighty heart
And tossed its life-blood to tliemigbty winds, and
cried :
“ Bear witness, ye, before the mountain crags,
And hymn it to the rocks that I chose death
Itself to slavery.” And ever since
The traveller in the rocky pass may hear
The storm wind sing—
The fetters of the slave '
Must by himself be wrought;
Heroic men and brave,
Heroes of deed and thought,
Prefer a freeman’s grave,
And on the dead men’s plains
They spurn the slaver's chains.
Ah me ! If men were men with lion hearts
And eyes that glow witli Resolution’s fire,
Like sunken coals, undimmed, unquenchable,
Oh ! what a band of Labour Knights would ride
Abroad to rend Oppression’s chains and hurl
That tyrant, Capital, from its despotic throne.
Then would the hearts of men be temples meet
For Liberty to dwell, nor be defiled.
Behind each brow would glow the noble light
Of God-like consciousness, and crown the face
With manly beauty, pow’r, and will.
THE WORKER.
* What little real difference there is after centuries
upon centuries of so-called “progress” can be seen by
contrasting the condition of the English agricultural
labourer, or the workers in the match-factories, with that
of the worst type of Roman slavery, as described in
Columella, De lie llustica, i, 8.
t Dante, Moncirchica.
J “The Church has been, since the days of the first
Edward, the will ng servant of State-craft, and hits rarely
raised its voice against wrong-doing” (Thorold Rogers’
“Six Centuries of Work and Wages”). In Queensland
to-day tins is only too true.

Here at Last 2
Some seven years ago a strange thing happened to the lady
whose photo, appeals herewith, whereby she became
A MYSTKRY
Which no one can explain or account for so far, not even her
husband. How it happened was this : She lay dying of a compli-
cation of diseases ; often she would faint off, and lie unconscious
as long as 30 hours at a stretch—frigid as a corpse and apparently
dead. The leading medical men of Melbourne were in attendance,
often at a cost of Five Guinean a day, yet she sank lower and
lower. Everything that medical science could suggest was tried ,
even morphia failed to give enough ease for two hours sleep
daily. At last, in desperation, some said, “ Try Mesmerism-.
Mr. Harle, as a Mesmerist,
Had been very successful on the public platform, and had also
saved life by private magnetic treatment; but Mrs. Harle, being
a lady of very pronounced opinions and strong mind of her own,
never could see anything in it but a hobby of his, and so, when
urged to try it, she ridiculed the very idea ; but they said, ‘ Ivy
it for sleep only— you will go mad for want of rest.” For a long
time she could not bring her mind to submit; at last, after much
prayer to God for guidance and help, she w'as willing to try.
After about half an hour’s mesmeric influence and passes, she
went off into a peaceful hypnotic state, which lasted, as was
intended, from eight at night till ten next morning; and she
awoke rested and refreshed. The experiment was repeated, when
Lo! Everyone was Startled
■
Mrs. J. N. HARLE.
To find that, whilst to all intents and purposes she was asleep, yet in another sense, the mind was far more awake,
and she commenced talking about what the servant was doing on the ground floor, what
mile awav what was happening in the home of a dear friend some few blocks away, and so forth. Then she vyas
requested’to look into her own body ; this she did, and was surprised herself, and surprised everyone else by tracm,
the cause of her trouble, which proved to be mainly an internal cancer. She then told them how to cure hei.
Crowds of Friends Came to See Her,
For she had a large and influential circle of acquaintances. She astounded all by her marvellous powers of vision-
to see into their bodies as if they were made of transparent glass, to see the members of their families, to know all
about their commercial affairs, seemed quite easy to her ; England, America, New Zealand, etc., seemed just like next
door ' The Sensation was Immense!
Drawing-room, Sitting-room, Dining-room and Bedroom were crowded with inquisitive people, and the invalid became
a phenomenTn’. The doctors were nonplussed with their patient-she gave directions how to so ten.thecancer to the
lancing state: this was done ; then, as they dare not give chloroform on acamnt of her heart, Mi . Ha her under
mesmerism, whilst Drs. Teague, of Collins Street, lanced it. She awoke without having felt anything that had hap
pened. Everyone said: “ Start and use your powers for doing good, you can
Save Lives by Thousands.”
But her health was too low. First, she cured herself—in three months’ time she was again taking her accustomed
drives on the Esplanade, in her phaeton, to the astonishment of the whole district. To properly tone the system a
change of climate was needed, and she came to N.S. Wales. For a short time she resided in Maitland ; her retreat
was known by those who were aware of her powers, and she got no peace till she agreed to start practice. Five years
ago Mrs Harle opened in Newcastle ; three years out of the five have been spent travelling in the Northern district,
and away in the bush discovering gold mines, and she seems to be able to find gold as easy as tiace disease.
Seven Thousand People Have Consulted Her
In her mesmeric state; some about business, but most about their health. Not one can say: “I am worse for your
treatment,” whilst all who have followed the advice and treatment, rejoice in restored health. Mrs. Harle describes
each diseased organ, finds the cause of every trouble, and prescribes remedies and treatment. Her wonderful mental
vision or clear sight enables her to see just what medicine, and how long it will take to cure it, often giving the
medicine three months ahead, and never changing a bottle.
Warning!
If vou wish to mortally offend Mrs. Harle, just class her along with the card-reading, palm-scanning, fortune-telling
crowd and the task is done. No such rubbish 1 Mrs. Harle is mesmerised by her husband, and when in the hypnotic
state she sees with her mind. She cannot open her eyes, yet she hears, talks, asks and answers questions, etc. When
the mesmerism is undone, she awakes, and knows no more of w'hat has happened, than if she had been chloroformed
01 It Causes a Terrible Mental Strain,
Therefore. Mr. Harle reserves the right to say when she has done enough, and may refuse any or all at such times.
The Fee is half-a-guinea for bodily examination, and a guinea for business advice. The half-guinea includes a
complete tracing of your case, and a full statement of how to cure you. Business men have voluntarily paid as high as
£5 and even £l5, for the arrangement of a business tangle. She guarantees in all cases a full value in the treatment,
and more satisfaction all round than can possibly be obtained by any other means whatever. Special medicine is
prepared for each case treated. Mrs. Harle is prepared to work with the family physician or any qualified medical
man if her suggestions are carried out. She is prepared to treat any case that can be cured, but insists upon only
usino- her Eclectic Botanic Remedies-she has no faith in mineral medicines. It is desirable to make appointments oi
come early in the day, whilst her brain power is fresh. Outdoor visits must also be arranged. .... . .

Harle’s chief reason for visiting Sydney tor some six months is to introduce her Remedies to the
Public, and open a Dispensary where people may call and see her or write for the Remedies or call for them.

412 GEORGE STREET, and STRAND ARCADE, SYDNEY. MELBOURNE and AUCKLAND
A Bushman’s Song.
(FOR THE BULLETIN.)
I’m travelling down the Castlereagh, and I’m a
station-hand,
I’m handy with the ropin’ pole, I’m handy with
the brand,
And I can ride a rowdy colt, or swing the axe all
day,
But there’s no demand for a station-hand along
the Castlereagh.
So it’s shift, boys, shift, for there isn’t the slightest
doubt
That we’ve got to make a shift to the stations
further out,
With the pack-horse running after, for he follows
like a dog,
We must strike across the country at the old jig-
jog.
This old black horse I’m riding—if you’ll notice
what’s his brand,
He wears the crooked R, you see—none better in
the land.
He takes a lot of beating, and the other day we
tried,
For a bit of a joke, with a racing bloke, for twenty
pounds a-side.
It was shift, boys, shift, for there wasn’t the
slightest doubt
That I had to make him shift, for the money was
nearly out;
But he cantered home a winner, with the othe r
one at the flog—
He’s a red-hot sort to pick up with his old jig-jog-
I asked a cove for shearing once along the Mar-
thaguy:
“We shear non-union, here,” says he, “ I call it
scab,” says I.
I looked along the shearing floor before I turned
to go—
There were eight or ten dashed Chinamen
a-shearin’ in a row.
It was shift, boys, shift, for there wasn’t the
slightest doubt
It was time to make a shift with the leprosy about.
So I saddled up my horses and I whistled to my
dog,
And I left his scabby station at the old jig-jog.
I went to Illawarra where my brother’s got a
farm,
He has to ask his landlord’s leave before he lifts
his arm ;
The landlord owns the country side—man, woman
dog, and cat,
They haven’t the cheek to dare to speak without
they touch their hat.
It was shift, boys, shift, for there wasn’t the
slightest doubt
Their little landlord god and I would soon have
fallen out;
Was I to touch my hat to him ? —was I his bloom-
ing dog?
So I makes for up the country at the old jig-jog.
But it’s time that I was movin’, I’ve a mighty
way to go
Till I drink artesian water from a thousand feet
below;
Till I meet the overlanders witli the cattle coming
down,
And I’ll work a while till I make a pile, then
have a spree in town.
So, it’s shift, boys, shift, for there isn’t the
slightest doubt
We’ve got to make a shift to the stations further
out;
The pack-horse runs behind ns, for he follows like
a dog,
And we cross a lot of country at the old jig-jog.
B.
Waiting for the Leader.
(FOR THE BULLETIN.)
O when will our-great leader come—
Our weary hearts begin lo fail,
And foes on ev’ry side assail,
In hordes we cannot sum?
We need one who will bravely bear
The heat and burden of the day,
Who will not faint upon the way
O’er-vvearied with despair.
One who will not through traitor wiles
Allow his honour to be sold ;
Who’ll scorn alike the tempter’s gold,
A ruler’s nods and smiles —
Who’ll bear a high and stainless name,
And choose the stern and virtuous part
t That bigots may not break his heart
Xnd hound him down to shame.
Who’ll lead the people into light,
And cast the greedy tyrant down,
And spoil him of his bloody crown,
And turn the wrong to right.
The millions scourged by Mammon’s whips
Are biting savagely their chains ;
Their masters tremble for their gains
And whiten to the lips.
We’re arming for the fight that comes
Sure as day follows on the dawn,
And loudly on some dreadful morn
Will beat the battle drums.
Law’s tedious course is all too slow—
Law helps the rich to spoil the poor—
The keen and flashing sword is sure
To heal the wrong we know.
They prate to us of lawful means ;
“ Make laws for your redress,” we’re told—
They buy our leaders with their gold
And laugh behind the scenes.
For centuries of bitter wrong
Have made it almost seem as right;
And all the harder is the fight
That custom’s power is strong.
But now the wide world is awake—
And, seething like a lava flood,
The fire is mounting through the blood
That soon its bounds must break.
And when the accepted leader comes
’Tis then the crimson flags will fly,
And the war cries break against the sky
With the beating of the drums.
And as the bursting thunderstorm
Will clear the foul, unhealthy air,
And leave it with a fragrance rare,
And earth with brighter form,
So with the pent-up righteous wrath,
That bursts its human bounds at last,
And seems to devastate and blast
But purifies the earth.

A world that is drenched with a rain of tears
That shut out the light of the sun,
An endless eddy of hopes and fears,
Whirling ever through endless years,
Ah, when will their course be run ?
Then out of the darkness gleams a light,
Fair, hopeful phrases fall,
And hearts are moved for a bitter fight
That will set all things eternally right 5
Then the end—a funeral-pall.
’Twas only a flash of light in the dark,
And the noble effort was vain,
And the weary life, like a dying spark,
Vanished at last, leaving never a mark,
And the world has its same old pain.
Clermont, Sept. 26.
F. E. P. McDONALD.
A very old stager, just returned from the
North-West Pacific, called in at The Bulletin
office a few days ago and gave us the particulars
of a tragedy which, although it happened away
back in the “Fifties,” is full of interest in con-
nection with the escape of convicts from Australia
and Norfolk Island, and which, so far as we
know, has not been alluded to by any writer. The
incidents of this act of piracy were related to him
by two of the actors therein. They were at
that time (1875) both old men and on their way
from the Caroline Islands to the Pelew Group
with their wives and families, when they—with
the man who tells their story—were cast away on
one of the Caroline Group and lived together for
15 months. One was a white man named Harry,
and the other a native of Ocean Island —where the
tragedy occurred—named “Ocean Island Jack.”
In or about the year 1845, Harry, with four-
teen or fifteen other escaped convicts from
Australia and Norfolk Island, arrived at Plea-
sant Island in a whaler. This whaler had
worked her way through the various groups to the
Kingsraill Group, and it was at Drummond’s
Island (Taputeuea) that Harry and two others—
named Wilkins and Brady—came on board, and
asked for a passage. To their surprise they found
five others on the ship, picked up by the whaler at
some other island; one of these was a man
formerly known to Harry on the Hunter River as
“Cow-face,” who had, on two other occasions,
escaped and been re-captured and heavily flogged.
The captain of the whaler (the Amity K.) landed
the lot on Pleasant Island. Shortly after they
were joined by seven other escapes, and they
attached themselves to the six or seven different
native clans of Pleasant Island, and lived the
usual wild life prevalent in those days. In two or
three years four of the lot had met with deaths
from violence, either by the natives or from
the hands of their comrades. Harry and some
five others, among whom were Wilkins, Brady,
Macdonald and “Cow-face” (the latter’s surname
was never known) then went tb liVe oh Ocean
Island, distant aboht a day’s sail away—Ocean
Island being in lat. 0.50 South, and long. 168.20
East; and Pleasant Island lat. 0.28 South, and
167.15 East —both almost on the Equator, and
about 3000 miles from Sydney., Here they led the
same sort of life As at Pleasant Island. One day in
December, 1852, the whaling brig Inga, of New
Bedford, IJ.S.A., called at Ocean Island, and in
the evening the convicts formed a plot to cut her
off, which was successfully carried out by the aid of
the Ocean Islanders, led by “Oceanlsland Jack.”
The captain and a boat-steerer and two others
went with Harry to get some pumpkins,
growing a few hundred yards from his house.
Harry complained of being ill and went back
fot a drink, leaving the captain with Jack,
Who, having enticed him out of sight of the
three others, stabbed him to death while drinks
ing from a cocoanut. The boat-steerer and the
other two men, and also ten men on liberty, were
all murdered, but so qiiietly Was it done that on
the ship, which was lying-to within a short
distance, not a sound was heard to alarm the
mate. Three of the convicts were on board, and
were having dinner with the mate, a man named
Nash, and other officers, when the brig was rushed
by a horde of natives, many of them boarding in
canoes, others swimming off. In a few minutes
every man of the crew was killed except the
cooper, who was in charge of the deck, and who,
after killing a native with a whale-spade, took
refuge in the main-top, where he soon died from
loss of blood and fell to the deck. The ship was
then looted and set on fire, but fearing the
smoke and flame would perhaps bring up another
whaler, she was hurriedly scuttled, and sunk irt
59 or 60 fathoms of water. For about a couple
of years after this the Ocean Islanders (at
the instance of the whites) would not hold any
communication with ships for fear of discovery of
the end of the Inga. Wilson (who killed the
second mate and steward with a horse-pistol)
went away to Valparaiso in a whaler, and died
there. Brady and “ Cow-face ” were both killed
on the island. Of the fate of most of the others
on Pleasant Island nothing is known. Harry, up
to 1882, was living on one of the Pelew Islands,
in good circumstances, and Ocean Island Jack
died on Ngatik, near Ponape (Caroline Islands),
only a few months ago. Pleasant Island is still
as thickly populated as it was in the “ fifties,” but
things are changed there now, it having been by
some curious arrangement annexed into the “Mar-
shall Island Protectorate ”by Germany. There is
a Deputy-Commissioner there, and no English or
other foreign vessel is permitted to call and trade
locally without first getting a clearance from the
Commissioner at Jaluit, in the Marshall Islands.
As for Ocean Island, its lot has been a hard one,
successive droughts having ruined and decimated
its once teeming population. The few survivors
(about 300) have barely enough cocoanuts to live
on, supplemented by pumpkins. They do a good
trade, however, in shark-skins and fins with Ger-
man trading vessels. The droves of sharks at
Ocean Island are a sight worth seeing.

THE ESTATE OF
FONTAINEBLEAU,
WEXTW(» RT li FALI. S.
THIS MAGNIFICENT ESTATE of 239 ACRES has been
* surveyed by Messrs. Miller and Lewis, of Pitt Street,
Sydney, into 138 Allotments, ranging from 1 Acre
Residential Blocks to 10J Acres, situate only 500 yards
from the WENTWORTH FALLS RAILWAY STATION,
on the opposite side of the line. It embraces all that fine
and elevated land opposite the mansion of R. M. Pitt,
Esq., whose splendid garden excites the admiration of
every passenger on the Great Western railway.
When the delightful climate of Wentworth Falls is taken
into consideration, the place may be safely described as
The Madeira «f (he Blue Mountains.
Delicate constitutions and worn-out business men are
benefited equally by the refreshing purity of the 'mountain
air, and the estate is not surpassed for residential purposes.
The FONTAINEBLEAU ESTATE
is well described by the poet, viz.;
The waratah, all gleaming red,
Lifting in pride its stately head,
Shines through the clustering ferns ;
While as the wattle’s yellow bloom
Falls in soft showers, its deep perfume
The air to sweetness turns.
Would you this haunt of beauty know?
’Tis the charming Estate of Fontainebleau !
The Blaxland Road is now being made from the Railway
fence, and, as;it runs right through this magnificent estate,
it will, when finished, be without exception the finest
Carriage Drive on the Mountains.
The FONTAINEBLEAU ESTATE is the most elevated
and beautiful about Wentworth Falls far and away
superior to the land on the other side of the line. The
picturesque views and the extreme fertility of the soil
renders the place very attractive, and specially adapted
for Fruit or Flower Gardens, Orchards or Dairy Farms,
for which Nature seems to have intended it.
Early Buyers will do well to secure their Lots at
once, as they are likely to largely’ advance in value. The
terms are liberal, to suit all buyers. For lithos., and all
