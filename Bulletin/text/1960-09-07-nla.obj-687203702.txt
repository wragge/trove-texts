PRICE WARUNG
Price Warung’s stories have been so
long out of print that, except to a few
specialists, his name is hardly more
than a legend in the literary world ;
and, to the public, less than that. Yet
he wrote too well or too intriguingly
to be dropped out of sight ; and for that
reason it is pleasing to see him
brought up again by the Australasian
Book Society in Convict Days—a selec-
tion of short-stories from several of
his books.
Who was he? A lively little article in
“The Australian Encyclopaedia” which
—the article, not the whole ten volumes
—appears to have been written by
“The Bulletin’s” old friend W. E. Fitz
Henry (and appropriately enough, since
it was in “The Bulletin” that most of
Price Warung's stories were first
printed) reminds us that his real name
was William Astley and that he came
to Melbourne from Liverpool when he
was four years old —the same age at
which, also to the profit of the arts
in Australia, Gruner was brought front
New Zealand. He worked for various
newspapers in Victoria and Tasmania,
is thought to have been an addict to
morphia, and seems to have shocked
Fitz Henry by being a teetotaller: —
Astley was a powerful writer who
concentrated on the convict period,
revealing Australia's “sordid past.”
He had few friends, it is said, and
unlike many of his Bulletin contem-
poraries was not by nature a bohe-
mian. He was inclined to be secre-
tive and suspicious and, being usually
impecunious, was driven to evasions
to obtain money.
An interesting man to reprint.
Reprints of books published far in
the past —and 60 years seems a long
time in Australia ; another world—fall
naturally into two categories: books
which are worth rereading simply for
entertainment or as historical curiosities
and books which, in A. G. Stephens’s
useful term, are fitted to become “Aus-
tralian classics or semi-classics.” No
doubt the two categories tend to merge
since if a book stays entertaining or
curious long enough it acquires some
sort of classic or “semi-classip” sta-
ture, whatever its purely literary merits.
It belongs to the life of the nation.
The present volume hardly offers
sufficient evidence as to Price Warung’s
stature for anyone to decide in which
category, so far as they can be dis-
tinguished, his stories should be placed.
He published five books of stories—not
four, as the introduction here states —-
and this is a fairly slim selection.
Furthermore, he wrote unevenly and to
some extent repetitively.
However he also wrote impressively
at his best. He has a kind of savage
individual force, a flair for striking
scenes, and no mean gift of irony. And,
partly because of his merits, partly
because of the intrinsic interest of his
subjectmatter—with its appearance, not
always valid, of authenticity—it is
difficult to imagine any time in the
future when Australians will not want
to read him. Like Marcus Clarke and
William Gosse Hay (two much more
impressive writers in the same field)
he has the advantage that he lived near
enough to the convict period for his
writings to have the appearance almost
of first-hand documents.
It is quite startling in one of the
stories to come across the sentence,
“The time is five o’clock on a Sep-
tember evening. 55 years ago”: so
close was Price Warung to those incred-
ibly bad old days, so close are we still to
Warung. Though of course his stories
were based on research, as were the
novels of Clarke and (much later) Hay,
they do not seem to have the must of
the library on them as do the convict-
novels of more recent writers, but
rather the freshness, the harshness, the
immediacy of a time when the System
was still close enough for feeling about.,
it to be genuinely deep and urgent.
It must be said that in most of the
opening stories of “Convict Days”
Warung seems a doubtful contender
for immortality, though he could still
be read for curiosity, for his flashes
of power, and for his melodrama.
“Lieutenant Darrell's Predicament”
—about how this sadistic officer fixed
some cruel, mechanical gag in a con-
vict's mouth and was thereupon
attacked by the gang—reads with some
force as it goes along; but the end-

AUSTRALIAN RACIAL UNITY
~p,IFTY years ago the problem put up
A on most political platforms was:
“Can we keep Australia white?” This
has become almost forgotten in an
age in which it is accepted (at the
hands of Leftist publicists) that any-
body who is not white is a martyr.
The spotlight of public opinion is
so closely concentrated on the colored
and the oppressed that it doesn’t focus
on the greater and more immediate
problems that every New World coun-
try faces: “Can we keep Australia
[or the United States or Canada] raci-
ally in one piece?”
There are even those who would
be prepared to argue that it is not
desirable to keep them in one piece.
Students who come here under the
Colombo Plan are often made pets of in
the schools and universities, and those
who meet them regularly seem some-
how to be convinced that they have
been done an injustice by our British
and other forebears; that in their
own countries they are very superior
persons who have yet been barred from
European association.
This myth is not one whit dissipated
by the fact that many of the Colombo
Plan students are the sons of wealthy
or influential families and have no
real economic problems themselves.
Meanwhile, on a larger scale, immi-
gration is being considered mainly in
terms of numbers under the impression
that in the world of U.N. and the
flapper press, freedom from national
molestation is supposed to depend on
having a population large enough to
ward off attackers or huge influxes of
unwelcome outsiders who might flow
naturally into our comparative vacuum.
Theoretically, except in the case of
world war, Australia today is com-
paratively safe. All round the world
are examples to prove this. Embryo
nations indulge in the queerest antics,
the most violent assaults on the patience
and self-respect of nations that could
eat them alive in conflict, but they sur-
vive from riot to riot with the assur-
ance that if anybody so much as sniffs
in their direction, Mr. Hammarskjold
will be with them mustering a force of
blue helmets to see that they are able
to continue to go their own boisterous
ways.
Yet Australia continues to pursue
an immigration policy based on
quantity rather than quality with an
almost feverish haste, as the policy
of the Government seems to be that it
needs population—any European popu-
lation.
The British cannot provide it, hav-
ing labor shortages of their own ; there-
fore let it come from the depressed toe
of Italy, Sicily, Poland or Cyprus,
irrespective of whether it will assimi-
late or what its habits may be.
The main trouble with our present
migration policy seems to be that assis-
ted passages bring, among the desir-
able migrants, a proportion of people
who have not the character or other
qualities of those who have migrated to
Australia deliberately and at their own
expense as a matter of calculated
choice. These people who don’t mea-
sure up to what is required of them
in a new country are a minority of the
total intake, but a fairly obvious
minority just the same.
/OCCASIONALLY the Immigration
Department finds itself in rather a
bad spot when some Continental goes
out, as one does at intervals, and lashes
into a crowd with an axe, or wipes out
a family. Newly arrived immigrants
may not match Australians in con-
victions for theft, jaywalking and driv-
ing on the wrong side of the road, but
in the records of horrifying crimes they
appear to figure with a remarkable
and disturbing frequency.
An even more disturbing factor of
immigration is that a large propor-
tion of immigrants are not assimi-
lating into the population.
Some are living in national enclaves
to an extent that is worrying even Mr.
Downer, Minister for Immigration.
Part of his trouble, no doubt, lies in
the nomination system. A Greek is
allowed to come to the country,
makes a little money and nominates
his relations. His relations nominate
their relations and friends, with the
result that all the time there is being
built-up one, large, happy co-operative
combination of friends, relatives and
neighbors who pool their resources to
buy businesses.
Thus, immigration from certain
southern countries of the continent of
Europe is not now feeding the Austra-
lian community so much but largely
a series of European communities, each
with its own specialities in trade —fruit
and veg., fish and chips or what have
you—each sticking to its own language
and racial and family .
familiar religions. bl s ’ lts <»

tralian-born offspring of these encfei
communities may not become At
tralians in the true sense.
Mr. Downer has mentioned tliai
only 53 per cent, of the migrants who
come here become naturalised, and,
since the number that comes is going
on for 100,000 a year over a longterm*
the effects are easy to estimate, but
not so easy to observe without peitoba-
tion.
THK United States is an example of
what the result of this sort of intake
of population is. It has a large number
of areas which to all intents ail
purposes are small foreign countries
marooned on a transatlantic shore;
communities with few sentimental nit
ional ties with the United States oril
objectives and ideals, however much
they may be rooted in their own par-

The United States, in fact, even
though it has long rationed immigra-
tion and sieved it with a fine sieve,lias
little of the deeprooted and united
patriotism to the nation as a whole®

Australia, or Germany.

ANOTHER WORLD RECORD?


PLAIN ENGLISH
Red Invasion
Khrushchev’s determination to attend
the U.N. Assembly meeting on September
20, at which Australia will be represented
by Sir Garfield Barwick, is another move
in the policy of carrying his campaigns
into enemy countries in order to divide
the peoples of those countries from their
Governments. With him will go the
heads of his six East European satellites
to act as a chorus.
Normally the head of a foreign State
does not visit another country except
upon the invitation of its head; but
the United States is now discovering that
in sucking the U.N. onto American soil
it has established an international State
on the East River into which any
enemy may come, secure in the know-
ledge that all the U.S. press and its
world news-distributing agencies will join
wholeheartedly in helping him to carry
out his propaganda job.
The more abusive of the United States
and its allies he is, the more subversive
of international order and the more
incitement to hysterical and backward
savages he indulges in, the more black
headlines his efforts will earn for him.
It seems unlikely that President Eisen-
hower will lend him importance by going
to the meeting, and it is equally doubtful
whether Mr. Macmillian will go if Presi-
dent Eisenhower does not.
Since Russia has on the menu for the
feast of gabble at U.N. a resolution to
debate “the menace to world peace
created by the aggressive actions of the
United States,” and has recently
threatened on more than one occasion to
drop bombs on America if the U.S.
dares to transgress his orders in Africa
and Cuba, the kind of debate he proposes
can easily be imagined.
Moreover, if events shape themselves
as they seem likely to do in Germany,
the battle for recognition of East Ger-
many may be fought—in its oral stages
anyway—within the Western lines, and
a fait accompli achieved in Berlin itself
while Khrushchev distracts attention from
what is going on there by his antics in
New York.
Anything might happen in ttje now
polyglot and mostly black-andmrindle
assembly which calls itself by courtesy
the “United Nations,” most of the
members being neither stable nations por
united.
Labor Floundering
[From Canberra]
Claims by the D.L.P. that removal from
Labor leadership of Dr. Evatt would not
solve the party’s problems are being
borne out more and more as each day
passes.
Labor’s showing in the Budget
debate showed that Arthur Calwell has
provided no cure for Labor’s ills and that
what is needed is a complete reorienta-
tion of Labor’s views to meet the changed
conditions in today’s world.
While every Labor speaker, from
Calwell down, has found plenty to criti-
cise the Government about in the Budget,
not one has offered an alternative solu-
tion to today’s economic troubles.
Labor’s only proposals to date have
been to give pensioners more than the
ss. increase granted and to hold a refer-
endum to grant the Commonwealth addi-
tional economic powers.
These are negative proposals, from a
negative party, floundering in deep
water.
There is little hope of Labor regaining
the Treasury benches until it brings its
thinking up to date, ceases to rely simply
on destructive criticism of the Govern-
ment, and comes up with some construct-
ive thinking to show the people that it
has a plan for Australia which will bring
better results than present Government
policies.
B.H.P.'s Bonus-issue
Broken Hill Proprietary’s one-for-two
issue of bonus shares, to be financed out
of a revaluation of assets, with “the divi-
dend next following the issue.... reduced
proportionately to two-thirds of what it
would otherwise have been,” again
emphasises that B.H.P. for the past 20
years has been a vast Australian public
utility, with returns to shareholders
trimmed accordingly.
During the war years B.H.P. supplied
steel in Australia’s war effort at cost
price, and from 1940 to 1947 the dividend
averaged 6.2 p.c. In 1948 it rose to 8|
p.c. and stayed at that figure until 1954,
creeping up to 10 p.c. in 1956 ; then,
in 1958, following the two-for-nine
bonus-issue made out of share-premiums,
it dropped to 8| p.c. (making the total
distribution immediately after the bonus
the same as before it). Last term the rate
rose to 9.1 p.c. *
The effect of these recent bonus-issues
has been to reduce the rate of dividend
on subsequent issues of shares offered
for cash. It would appear that the
maximum immediate rate likely to be
paid on next year’s cash offering would
be 6f p.c.; and it could be slightly lower
than that.
B.H.P. faces bigger expansion than
ever before. Demand for steel even now
is running ahead of supply, and plans
for greater steel production embrace not
only new plant but new methods —an
oxygen process of steelmaking, the
Linz-Donawitz (L.D.) process is to be
introduced in the £4l-million project at
Whyalla (S.A.) and also at Newcastle
(N.S.W.).
In order to fulfil its obligation to keep
Australia supplied with steel B.H.P. has
had to find huge capital sums for plant
and search the country for suitable man-
power. “We are once again in a posi-
tion where the rate of our expansion
looks like being controlled by manpower
shortages,” chairman Colin York Syme
told shareholders at the annual meeting.
B.H.P. has raised huge sums of share-
capital and external finance in paying
for its post-war expansion, and has had
great resort to ploughed-back profits.
One of its problems has been the com-
mon one in Australian industry of not
being granted adequate tax W ,
tion allowances by the Federal t preci »-
This has prompted it to set
round sums each year as S pel, large
vision for plant-replacement in P pr °-
ordinary depreciation allowances $S ° f

Apart from straightforward *L
premiums (which have tended to bed
unpopular), we have convertible 2
(even non-interest-bearing convert!
notes), options,” and a great turn t
plain, unconvertible notes. Most of
these methods of finance depend 0
popularity of the particular co/s
ordinary shares. B.H.P.’s method of
making a bonus-issue and then reducin«
the dividend-rate on new as well as old
capital enables it to finance its big ex-
pansion at a comparatively low cost in
dividends to shareholders. This, too
is an operation that depends on mtet
popularity of its scrip.
How long a stock’s sharemarket popu-
larity can be sustained in the face of a
relatively low rate of dividend ora
a long period is one of those intriguing
financial questions on which investors
are speculating at the moment. To date
“Somewhere over the rainbow, ’way up
high,” has been the theme which has
maintained a steep premium on many
low-yielding stocks.
However popular B.H.P.’s scrip may
be, no one can point a finger and say
that the 64,539 shareholders in the co,
are waxing fat at the expense of Aus-
tralian steel-consumers. In view of tie
inflation in values that has taken place,
the present dividend-return to share-
holders, and the average over the past
20 years, has been a modest one indeed,

Dr. Dux's Revolution
lx was characteristic of Dr. Cunningham
Dax, director of the Victorian Mental
Hygiene Authority, to use his selection

dims the needs of the 1500 retarded
children in his care.
About the same time, the Prime

place of the padded cell and bars came
drugs, special treatment, new techniques,
surgery; brighter rooms, therapy,
humane administration, auxiliaries, and,
very importantly, the gradual change in
the public outlook as he talked to meet-
ings in town and country, with the result
that the release rate from mental hospi-
tals has risen sharply.
One of Dr. Dax’s chief successes has
been in reducing fear and ignorance of
mental illness, and in more patients seek-
ing early treatment for what he has
insisted should be regarded as a break-
down in health. Now rising is a network
of mental hospitals in the country and
provinces where country people have
easy access to psychiatrists.

is a centre where the intolerably de-
pressed or worried person may seek
advice or talk things over with a well-
informed and sympathetic expert. This
followed the opening of the alcoholic
centre in Melbourne at which he made
known his views on the need for better
drinking conditions in Victoria —
obviously longer hours —and less potent
beer.
He has also recently pointed to the
Federal Government’s annual £ 100-
million in excise on beer and spirits,
suggesting that a penny of the excise
on beer should be devoted to the work
of rehabilitating alcoholics.
The Prime Minister - and - incoming-
acting-Treasurer made no reference to
this at the opening of the centre. Clearly,
it was too revolutionary altogether.
Dr. Dax’s work in Victoria has been
recognised overseas. He is now off to
the meetings of the World Health
Organisation as one of the expert
advisory panel on mental health.
Germany Today
As September 15 approaches concern
about the proposed meeting of the
Federal German Legislature in West
Berlin increases.
The German Government has said that
it will hold it. Last year it asked its
Western allies in Nato for their opinion,
and they were not friendly towards an
idea calculated to stir-up the Soviet
hornet’s nest.
This year, if the West has been asked,
it has issued no definite opinion, and
has had no known consultation, despite
the fact that Khrushchev announced
bluntly that if the meeting were held
he would regard it as a provocation and
sign a separate peace with the East Ger-
mans, a move that could precipitate any-
thing, since it certainly would engulf all
the routes into Berlin and raise the ques-
tion of the ejection of Allied forces.
The German Government is in a cleft
stick. It is obviously not anxious for
the meeting, which rests on the decision
of the President of the Bundestag, Dr.
Gerstenmaler. But it also sees the politi-
cal implications with the West Berliners
and East Germans of allowing Khrush-
chev to dictate where the assembly of
free Federal Germany shall meet within
its own territory, of which West Berlin
is certainly part.
The French were said not to favor
the meeting. The British have made
no comment. But the United States is
believed to be inclined to back West
Germany in view of the need to prevent
the idea getting about among the weaker
countries of Europe that Khrushchev’s
threats are effective even in a single
instance.
The position has become more compli-
cated in the past few weeks through the
emergence of Willi Brandt, Chief Burgo-
master of Berlin, as the Social Demo-
cratic candidate for the Chancellorship
of Federal Germany at next year’s
elections.
Forty-six years old, vigorous and able,
he has been the core of West Berlin’s
toughness during the past few years. With
Dr. Adenauer reaching .the end of his
tether, he has an excellent chance of
succeeding, especially since he has gained
some kudos among members of other
parties who joined him in resenting a
pamphlet recently distributed to the
defence forces which seemed to be an
intrusion of military leaders into the
politics of defence, though, generally
speaking, it only expressed Government
policy, partly unratified by Parliament.
His policy is that Germany’s Western
alliances and friendship with the United
States must remain the cornerstone of
foreign policy, and he lays particular
stress on the need for close relationships
with France and Britain.
His emergence as an all-Republican
leader and candidate for the Chancellor-
ship makes it doubly difficult for the
Legislature to ignore his wish for the
Berlin meeting, especially since a large
number of members feel that to back-
down now would be to invite the Soviet
Union to go ahead with its impudent
plans for permanently taking over Ger-
many up to the Elbe.
The restrictions on entry from West
Germany, and on the freedom of move-
ment of troops in the Occupation zones,
has gradually been tightened up, osten-
sibly by the East Germans, until on
August 30 guards on the East-West
border were doubled and West Germans
were refused permission to cross into
Berlin. At the same time East Germany
warned the Western Powers of “conse-
quences” if the air-corridor was “mis-
used.” This measure seemed to be
aimed at West German rallies of various
ex-soldier and expelled Germans from
the East German territories taken over
by the Communists.
The Western Powers have declared the
restrictions “pretentious and objection-
able and illegal,” violating the Four
Power Agreement on Berlin and a denial
of the right of West Germans to carry
on their own affairs on their own elec-
toral territory. The rallies are certainly
inadvisable in the circumstances, but if
they are provocation they are an answer
to worse provocation and threats.
The fact that Britain and Germany
have come to an agreement this month
to pool major weapons, including rockets,
tanks and aircraft, both as to develop-
ment and production, shows that the
United Kingdom at least believes that
nothing is to be gained by soft-pedalling
on German defence as part of the
security of the Western world.

OLYMPIC ADDITIONS
In newspapers of various names,
Today, we see italicised
Unauthorised Olympic Games
That might be better organised.
The nations’ talents for complaint,
Cramped by sporting opposition,
Would flourish, freed from all restraint
In a Talkathlon competition.
For those athleticism bores
I’d urge a Pass-out Festival,
A crooked judge to keep the scores,
And thugs and drugs and boots-and-all
But, judging by the emphasis
The public prints have put thereon,
The greatest need of all is this:
A real Olympic Sexathlon —
Though, as to rules, I must confess
My knowledge of the subject scant,
And merely try to help the Press
Give the readers what they want.

friend of many years ago. The Ham-
mersteins were then in Boston for the
premiere of “The Drum Song.” Mrs.
Hammerstein wrote that each of their
shows was always given a try-out in
Boston before going to New York. She
was worried over her husband’s health ;
at the time he was at their farmhouse in
Pennsylvania recuperating from a serious
operation, and she mentioned in her
letter that two of Gye’s watercolors and
a pencil-drawing of his of the Yarra were
hanging in their Pennsylvania home, and
a design for a fan was in their recently-
bought home in Jamaica. Despite his

in sterling. The pay-clerk counted out
£A.I2 10s., passed over a slip, and said,
“Sign here.” The Teuton signed there,
gathered up two fivers and marched off.
The clerk called him back, waving the
two-and-a-half quid. “Send it back to
’im,” yelled the man from the Elbe;
“I only asked for ten pounds ; I got it”;
and he disappeared, leaving the clerk with
the money. The clerk noticed my grin.

“Archaean”: A friend of mine has
been devoting spare time to a study of
old cars still in use. Those which have
lasted longest are not the high-priced
British and Continental models, but
American makes in the low-price range.
First is the Essex, in its day considered
inferior to its bigger and more expensive
brother, the Hudson, yet my friend has
so far failed to find a Hudson of com-
parable vintage in use. Running the
Essex a close second are the Capitol
Chevrolet and the 1926 Dodge. I owned
one of those Dodges myself and I ran
it more than 250,000 miles, much of it
over very rough bush tracks, with one
rebore, one new set of pistons, two
renewals of kingpins and bushes in the


steering and nothing else in the way of
repairs and replacements. It still does a
spell of work once a year on the farm
of a friend, carrying a manure-spreader
to topdress 800 acres of pasture. Among
modern makes, the improved version of
the Holden looks as if it will be another
bus with a very long life. My friend
has also discovered that car-makers of
today aren’t interested in data of this
kind. An American and a British
designer made the same comment: “Cars
which refuse to wear-out are a curse to
the industry in the long run. We want
them to give no trouble for up to four
years, then to go on the scrap-heap.”
“Tiddles”: “Tabba” (B. 10/8/’6O) is
getting rather deep in the mire himself
in his criticism of J. C. Shelley on
diesels. There is always a key fitted to
diesel trucks. This doesn’t switch-off the
ignition, but it does prevent the engine
from being started. Removing the key
prevents usually the starter - motor
switching-circuit from operating, and as
hand - cranking of high - compression
diesels is rarely possible the engine can-
not be started. The only other course
would be to bridge the switch-leads in
the manner practised by car-thieves with
the earlier Holdens.

Goodsell's Bide to Hie Top Job
Clerk on Horseback
By OLIVER FILTER
A in the mid 1920’5,
Q in the dark and tangled
rt ra in-forests over the
" scarpment behind Wol-
J (N.S.W.), the black
[/wallabies and other
L’[ inhabitants were dis-
ced by clearing-gangs
working on the upper reaches
of the Avon River.
Their purpose was to clear
I; river-banks of timber as
ike water mounted behind the
ta which was being built
a dozen-or-so miles down-
mto supply Sydney with
from the dam itself a young
man, with an armed guard,
®d to ride out on horse-
bad and somehow find his
way through the jungle to pay
the clearing-gangs. The young
clerk on horseback was John
If, 'Goodsell, now president
of the Sydney Water Board
and just appointed to suc-
cted Wallace C. Wurth in
January next as chairman of
it N.S.W. Public Service
ford.
A meeting with Goodsell
today gives no hint of his
early years in the bush. In
view of an athletic past, his
medium height and burly
%e suggest that he might
have been a lean young strip-
ling to whom the years have
a little weight while
tiffining his hair.

. » Depart-
-01 Pu bhc Works and,
after two or three years, was
sent to Avon Dam.
The man who packed him
off to Avon was A. R. Stafford,
then a Works Department
inspector, and now secretary
of the Sydney Water Board:
“I can’t remember whether
Jack liked going to Avon or
not; I know he jacked-up
when I tried to introduce him
to a typewriter. I do know
he didn’t like leaving there.
He’d met Myrtle Austin —she
was the daughter of the chief-
inspector on the job.”
Goodsell himself recalls
arriving at Avon on a four-
ton Thornycroft and, on first
seeing the rows of white-
washed hessian dwellings,
thinking dejectedly that he had
arrived at an overblown
poultryfarm. He really liked
the atmosphere of the big
construction job, however, and
the surrounding bush. He
played Rugby League on the
Southern Highlands and
enjoyed his time-off in the
South Coast towns. In fact,
he liked it all so much that
he returned, in 1932, with the
ex-Miss Austin for their
honeymoon.
j>EFORE that, Goodsell had
gone over to work on the
nearby Nepean Dam, and then
back to Sydney to work on
the Harbor Bridge in the days
when you found your way
across it on planks and with
a rope for a handhold.
He moved up in 1929 to
inspector of the Works Depart-
ment’s water - supply and
electricity undertakings, and
J. W. GOODSELL
country - town water- and
sewerage-schemes. Somewhere
at this stage ambition rowelled
him very sharply, and he took
to locking himself in the
living-room every night and
setting up his books on a card-
table.
In two years, without a
tutor and studying at home at
night, he completed his
accountancy, town- and shire-
clerk, and higher-grade public
service courses. He passed the
final exams, in all three within
a spread of eight weeks.
Brilliance was beginning to
show with ambition, and the
necessary appetite for work.
He also developed a flair for
brevity which he has never
lost; he prefers half-a-dozen
facts to a report: “Put the
apples out in front where I
can see ’em.” He also had
another characteristic not un-
common in clever people—
shyness.
Looking around for the
next rung in the ladder he
applied for the job of local-
government inspector when
Works amalgamated with
Local Government in 1936.
He was interviewed by S.
Haviland, then Assistant
Under-Secretary of the depart-
ment and now appointed
president of the Water Board,
and by R. H. Hicks, then a P.S.
Board inspector and now
Under-Secretary of the Child
Welfare Department.
They plied him with ques-
tions for a few minutes until,
with characteristic brevity, he
cut in: “All the answers are
in my application.”
■COR a couple of years he
travelled all over N. S.
Wales looking into the con-
duct of council affairs ; then,
tired of living in hotel rooms
and dissatisfied with his pros-
pects, he changed camp again.
He went briefly to the Chief
Secretary’s Department.
A few weeks ago, at a
graduation ceremony at the
University of New South
Wales (he is a member of the
University Council), a woman
he did not know approached
him. She introduced herself:

Security Council and await admission on
September 20. The dissection is 19
European and North American countries,
10 Eastern European countries (all Soviet
satellites except one), 21 Asian countries
including “nations” like Yemen and Laos,
20 from Latin America, nine from Africa
and three antipodean British Common-
wealth nations. There are 14 new African
“nations” waiting admission —among
them ex-Belgian Congo, Gabon and
Dahomey—and, in Europe, Cyprus,
which, with a population of half-a-
million, will have an equal voting-power
with the United States and Britain if
admitted. There are still six more
African countries expected to apply.
Nine countries are non-members with no
entry in the offing—including Communist
China, West and East Germany, the
Koreas and Switzerland.

[From Canberra]
Prime Minister Menzies could now be
wondering about his decision to send the
possible future External Affairs Minister
Barwick to the U.N. meeting in New York
instead of going there himself.
Still, when Menzies made the decision, who
was to know that the Soviet team would have
been led by none other than Boss Khrushchev
himself?
This would have been a meeting that the
P.M. would scarcely have passed-up, wittingly,
for all the proverbial tea in China. Here was
the big chance to rub shoulders with and
debate against one of the world's most
powerful men.
It was the P.M.’s golden opportunity to
walk onto the world stage, where he could
have matched himself against Khrushchev on
the vital matters facing the West —disarmament,
“spying” (which undoubtedly will get an
airing) and the host of other matters listed
for debate in New York. But it is too late
to do anything about it now. Menzies cannot
turn around and reverse his decision by
keeping Barwick at home and going, instead,
himself.

T abor made ground in six suburban
council elections in Greater Melbourne
(although Air Marshal Sir George Jones
failed to get in in Oakleigh, a borderline
electoral district, for Labor), which may
be due to a reaction against long years
of Liberal rule in the Federal and State
Parliaments, but is more likely the result
of the non-Labor genteel disinclination
“to introduce party politics into muni-
cipal affairs.”
Laborites have no hesitation in stand-
ing for the A.L.P., and as a result
Collingwood and Altona, which are
Labor districts but have respectable
Liberal minorities, now are entirely
A.L.P.; there is only one independent
among 12 at Coburg, and gains were
made at Heidelberg, Williamstown and
Oakleigh.
Latest developments in Indonesia
seem to make it clear that there are
two Governments in that distressful land,
both governing by ban. Last month
Soekarno was busy banning the Dutch
in West New Guinea and the once
powerful Masjumi and Sociahst parties
everywhere. This month the Army has
banned the Communists in South Suma-
tra and Indonesian Borneo and questioned
them in Java. No doubt both are hoping
that it won’t be the Communists’ turn

Garfield Barwick, Fede r a 1 Attor-

delegation to the United Nations
Assembly this month —the most impor-
tant Assembly that has been held, and
perhaps the one which will decide U.N.’s
survival or otherwise. Do coming Minis-
terial events cast their shadows before?
One problem for Barwick at U.N. will
be the proposed reorganisation of the
Trusteeship Council, especially in view
of repeated statements by our friends
and others that Australia may well be-
come “the last of the colonial nations.”
The council, according to the U.N.
Charter, must consist of nations admin-
istering trust-territories, and the list no
longer includes France and Italy,
although it does still include Belgium.
“Other” Powers can be brought into the
council, and the debate on the moves
will be of considerable importance to
Australia.

couldn’t answer the question effectively,
but he had given a great deal of thought
to a name for “the most worthless coin

in favor of it being called a Ward.” That’s
called paying him back in his own coin.

The idea that exploding rockets in

farmers in the Granite Belt and asked
E. J. White, of the radiophysics division
of the C.5.1.R.0., if he could suggest an
error the farmers might have made which
would account for their lack of success.
White said the error lay in buying the
rockets in the first place. The amount
of energy in a thunderstorm was far and
away in excess of that of an atom-bomb ;
its effect could not possibly be diverted
by rockets.

blende, which he described as “a useful
by-product of coal and an outstanding

before and after the war he supervised the
installing of vehicular-actuated traffic-signals
in Australia’s capital cities. Going over to
British Insulated Callender’s Cables, Ltd., in
1951, he managed its Sydney branch in 1954
before being sent to Port Kembla to help in
establishing the power-cable industry—a joint
venture of 8.1.C.C. and Metal Manufactures,
Ltd. —and when, in 1958, the interests of this
new company were merged with those of
Fairfield Cables Pty., Ltd., he was appointed
head of the resultant company. Main product

Blue moonlight over Lovers’ Lane?
Not as fantastic as it may sound. In
fact, it was one of the “commercial possi-
bilities” dreamed-up in America around
1938, when the establishment of an arti-
ficial “moon,” or aurora, was shown to
be possible. A little later, when the guns
went off, someone else thought of using
such an aurora for spotting enemy
bombers at night, an idea that was
shelved when radar proved more versatile.
Responsible for such ideas—he actually
started it all —Victor Albert Bailey is now
Research Professor of Physics at Sydney
University. Sketched above by Lahm, he
had special reason for welcoming the
recent U.S. Air Force grant to the Uni-
versity of New England—it will enable
further research into his pet area, the
ionosphere.
Born in Egypt, Professor Bailey was educated
in England, where son John, N.S.W. Rhodes
scholar for 1956, has just submitted his thesis
for his D.Phil.; the degree his father was the
first to take in physics at Oxford. He came
to Australia in 1924 to take-up an associate-
professorship in experimental physics at Sydney
University, holding this post till 1952, when
he was made Research Professor (“which
means I just think and talk to people”). Next
year he did his thinking in America, a Ful-
bright scholarship taking him to Pennsylvania
State University.
As he well knows, there is a great difference
between having one’s work acknowledged and
being given the money to continue it, and
the U.S. Air Force grant is in a large way
a practical recognition of his own work. The
“aurora,” by the way, is only a side-issue.
The purpose of the grant is to set-up a trans-
mitter, powerful, but not powerful enough to
produce an “aurora,” which will bombard the
free electrons in the ionosphere with gyro-
waves, increasing the electrons’ energy. One
“beam” will be absorbed, causing this dis-
turbance, another will be reflected, the
reflected beam being used to measure the
PROFESSOR OF PHYSICS
content of, and resultant change in, the
ionosphere’s atmosphere.
“In other words, we are going to learn
more about the ionosphere.” A practical
advantage? Improvement in radio communica-
tion. For example, if the best possible
operating conditions can be created artificially,
it is not too highly improbable that we will
one day watch a direct telecast from London.
Another advantage will be that rocketeers will
know more of what their toys are likely to
encounter and will have better communications
with them.

In Sydney, at 79, George Ernest Archer
Russell, War I Digger, author and journalist.
His books —of which Murray Walkabout and
William James Farrar were two of many—
reflect his love and understanding of nature,
while years spent in the bush, in African
jungles and on a Murray River vineyard gave
his writing tough authenticity.
In Perth, at 84, Charles William Hadley,
former Director of Education and author of
a number of textbooks for Westralian schools.
He started as a 14-year-old pupil-teacher at
Orange (N.S.W.) and was an assistant-teacher
at Fort Street (Sydney) before transferring to
the W.A. Education Department in 1900.
Appointed inspector in 1912, senior-inspector
in 1928, he was director for some years before
he retired in 1939, but came back during
War II as acting-headmaster of the Hale
School from 1941 to 1945.
At Wyong (N.S.W.), at 62, Walter Leslie
Carter, former Commissioner for Government
Transport.
In Adelaide, at 52, Colin Ernest ■ Sutherland
Gordon, for 15 years headmaster of St. Peter’s

1930, coming to Australia a year later to
teach at Geelong Grammar and later at The
King’s School, Parramatta. Commissioned for
special duties with the R.A.A.F. during the

In Adelaide, at 79, the Rev. Samuel Forsyth,
founder of the Kuitpo Colony, president of
Adelaide’s Central Methodist Mission from
1929 until his retirement in 1952.


ABORIGINALITIES
VI/hether or not the old bush sayings
** are dying out, the traditional say-
ings of the building-trade are still going
strong. A piece of timber that doesn’t
quite make the length is still “short one
end”; brickies are still urged to “use
the bricks up quick before they run
out”; carpenters, trusting their lives —as
they usually do —on flimsy stages sup-
ported by one nail, are advised to “stand
on it light”; and anyone faced with the
problem of erecting a scaffold iq an
awkward position, or holding something
aloft where there’s nothing to support
it, is still told to “get a sky-hook.” This
last is not now so facetious as it used
to be, as the builders of the Baha'i
Temple at Mona Vale (near Sydney)
could testify. Their contract included
the placing of a crowning-piece known
as a “lantern-light” on the top of the
huge dome. The object stood 20ft. high
by 9ft. across, weighed more than 7cwt.,
and its location on the dome was to be
130 ft. above the ground—too high, and
in too awkward a position for even the
125 ft. jib on the mobile-crane. Truly
a case for a sky-hook, And a sky-hook
did the job. Attached to a helicopter,
it picked-up the base (4701 b.) from the
ground, placed it on the dome, returned
for the spire (2401 b.), lowered that into
exact position . . . and took just 17
minutes for the whole doings!

“Janus”: Three pine-cones haveb
sent to Grey mouth (N.Z.) from the V
pine at Melbourne’s War Ment,
Shrine—the tree there that was raised
from a cone souvenired by a 24th Bat
I ?- ig ? er on G all ipoli. The original
Gallipoli Lone Pine was a landmark
until destroyed in the heavy fights
Years later the significance of the
souvenir was realised, and from it several
seedlings were raised. One of the cones
for Greymouth will go to the local ke-
turned Services’ Association branch.
There are already two specimens of the
Gallipoli pine in New Zealand—one in
the soldiers’ lawn-cemetery at Napier,
the other not far away at Havelock
North. They are reputedly over 30 years
old. Are they from the parent tree or
from the Victorian cone? The year 192!
is given as the time when the Australia
seedlings were grown, so they could I*
from the same cone ; but what see®
more likely is that publicity was gi»
to the Australian venture at the time,
and some Enzedder w'as able to weigh-in
with a similar souvenir.

Old Fred Freeman was tellin’ me about
the time the Red FI ill tribe was cleaned

All the old hands, they was asleep-like,

They drove them boomerangs an’ made
them whistle.
Them boomerangs, they teared through

The Red Hill tribe, they couldn’t make

they grabbed their boomerangs an’, half

blazed back into them till, all around,

“You couldn’t pull them barbed spears

November 8, 1944, I described how I
rescued a doe-possum from a snare, took
her home, and 12 weeks later was re-
warded by finding that she had just given
birth to a joey. Now it seems fitting
that the joey’s death should also be
recorded in an “Abo.” par. It’s ridiculous
that'a grown man should get sentimental
over the death of a possum, but during
that 16 years I had a daily habit of
stopping on my way home from work
to collect the little bloke’s tucker. Until
recent years it was always a branch of
gumtips, but as encroaching civilisation
cut-out the bush, the nightly quest be-
came a handful of dock-leaves, which he
liked much better than his natural food,
anyway. And now .... I still find myself
pausing when I see a lush bunch of
docks on the way home ; and I still fancy
I can hear the old fellow gambolling
around his cage at
night and see the
little pink nose come
sniffing to the wire
in search of the
banana titbit. Ar,
damnitall . . . but it
does leave a gap.

“Alma”: Add to
the antics of the
musk - drake (B.
17/8/’6O) the habit
of suddenly inflating
the dangling pouch
beneath his beak,
either during his
aquatic acrobatics
or when he is just
swimming about,
and also calculated
to make hardened
sinners swear off it.
“Aubithol” errs in
only one thing: it
is the drake that
does all these dilly
things ; the missus is a quiet little soul,
going about her business with a complete
disregard for the old boy’s antics, which
are supposedly for her benefit. Although
not widely distributed, they are one of
the quietest of all ducks, and those that
spent the summer on our creek never
minded a human audience. One old
drake and a couple of ducks spent several
months on the waterhole only a few
yards from the house, he carrying on
with his acrobatics and the ladies stick-
ing strictly to domestic matters.

“J.W.” First time I ever heard of
cornsack blankets (B. 10 /8 / ”60) was
from Arthur Davis (“Steele Rudd”).
We lived next door to him in 1928, and
when he was in the mood he’d tell tales
about life on the land in nis boyhood ;
there were no luxuries, and the family
blankets were mostly cornsacks. Young
Arthur never forgot the joy of his first
warm, woolly blankets. The simplest and
easiest of men to deal with, landladies
found he would allow of no shenanigans
where blankets were concerned: they
had to be the best.
t ately farewelled in a Bulletin “Into
-L' the Silence” par., Captain Frame, of
the Taiping, was on the Changsha in
1923 as mate, imperturbably at bow-
station when Captain Gambrell, coming
alongside the coal-wharf at Sandakan
with the evil combination of an eight-
knot ebb-tide and a parted mooring-
warp, rammed the Changsha’s bowsprit
fair into a scupper of the poop deck-
house of S.S. Hinsang. Three Korean-
bound missionaries judged the incident
photogenic enough to warrant them
helter-skeltering with cameras up the
fo’c’sle companion-way to snap the in-
teresting situation. The commander,
relishing neither a clutter of skirted
Presbyterians in the danger-zone nor the
prospect of numerous graphic evidences
of this nautical faux pas, upped the
megaphone and bellowed: “Mister
"He Was born informal .”
Frame / . . . Clear your deck of those
Bible-banging females, even if you shove
them overboard! ” —“Sevenelms.”

“Fuzzy Wuzzy”: Fewer Europeans
than formerly have been prospecting for
gold in the eastern-central New Guinea
highlands, and in 10 years only £195,000-
worth of the metal has been produced.
There has been a big increase, however,
in the number of native gold-seekers,
most of whom can operate successfully
on returns too low to interest Europeans.

he was worth and said nothing. Came the
second load. After the loader was
hitched-on the boss was about to jump
in the truck when Jimmy says: “Eh,

“Kelms”: The U.S. Navy claims to
have found a shark-repellent at last,
made from a substance which sea-
cucumbers exude. Could be. The sea-
cucumber ( Holothurian ) is fairly closely
related to the starfish-group, althougti
the relationship isn’t obvious; and;;
has the typical starfish-characteristic oi I
being able to discard parts of its W
and grow replacements. It even goes®
better than the starfish; it can eject its
entire internal economy and replace it,
when it appears to have retained only
its skin. Hitherto I’ve assumed to;
this act of autotomy was designed, Ife
the lizard’s discarding of its tail, to dis-
tract and delay a pursuer; but it
be that the sea-cucumber, faced with
situation in which its usual exudaW
is inadequate, throws its entire armaitfl
at the enemy. If that’s so, the repels
must be effective —Holly has been usiiy
it for millions of years.

“W.P.T.”: The Service Department (B.
10/8/’6O) says “the first direct use of

sluicing-operations on the Kiandra gold-
fields in 1860.” The waters of the Snowy
were used for power in 1847 when
“Play your didgeridoo , Blue..."
Stewart Ryrie, jnr., erected the first flour-
mill in Monaro on the bank of the
Snowy River, and this mill used the water
of the Snowy as its motive-power.

“Laetitia”: When I was up that way,
the Torres Strait islanders concocted
their “pappai” highlight of village
feasts —from taro, yam, sweet-potato,
bananas, pork, fowl, dugong and turtle-
meat, crayfish and fish, all bundled into
banana-leaves, steeped in coconut-milk
and baked on the “coppa-maowrie,” or
oven of white-hot stones. It was rather
sickly for most Europeans, but courtesy
demanded that it be eaten. More dis-
concerting was the red-hot and glowing
green coconut, looking like the baking
skull it would have been in the bad old
days, with which each “pappai” was sur-
mounted while on the cooking-stones.
Anything was —and I hope still is—an
excuse for a feast, with weddings or
deaths as the major pretexts. The feast
was the ceremonial end to the “wailing”
or “sorry” time, during which a whole
village would, sometimes for several
days and nights on end, lament the
passing of the deceased. Cynics used to
say that the marathon wailings were
either appetisers or a way of paying for
one’s supper.
“Island Aussie”: Your “New Record-
ings” scribe, discussing an Andre Kos-
telanetz collection of tropical-island
songs (B. 3/ 8 / ’6O), mentions Bali Ha’i
and says in parenthesis “which James
A. Michener placed somewhere in the
Solomons.” No, sir! Bali Ha’i borders
the entrance to the harbor of Noumea,
New Caledonia. In 1942 the Americans
landed in this French colony. It took
them little time to swarm from north
to south with their heavy equipment,
jeeps and men, to establish their very
hush-hush base for their northern offen-
sive. The peace of our own rural area was
completely altered many Army huts,
Red Cross and a fully-equipped hospital
in the hills. Also an aerodrome with a
steel landing-strip, with planes flying
north to the Solomons. Noumea’s little
island was used as a backdrop in the play
“South Pacific.” James A. Michener
please note, and let New Caledonia come
into her own.
The “New Recordings” reviewer re-
plies: “Island Aussie” is no doubt right
about there being a Bali Ha’i at the
entrance to Noumea. But the presence
of U.S. troops in New Caledonia during
the war is no proof that it was this Bali
Ha’i that figured in “South Pacific.” The
play was based on James A. Michener’s
collection of stories Tales of the South
Pacific, in which the author had this to
say about the isle:
There was another island! Bali Ha’i
was an island of the sea, a jewel of the
vast ocean ... It was green like something
ever youthful, and it seemed to curve
itself like a woman into the rough shadows
formed by the volcanoes on the greater
island of Vanikoro.
Vanikoro is in the Santa Cruz group,
which for administrative purposes is part
of the Solomons. Michener is a writer
of fiction. If he chose to place his island
paradise near Vanikoro, then near Vani-
koro (and consequently in the Solomons)
it must remain.

CONSOLIDATED ZINC AND BELL BAT
/CONSOLIDATED ZINC Was a
natural contender for con-
trol of the Commonwealth-
Tasmania - owned Bell Bay
(Tas.) aluminium - works. Its
interest in Comalco, jointly
owned with British Aluminium
(now controlled by the Rey-
nolds Metal Corp. of the
U.S.A.), gave it a vital interest
in the production of aluminium
ingots in Australia.
Comalco is the concern ex-
ploring and developing the vast
and rich deposits of bauxite on
Cape York (Q.) and in Arnhem
Land, and, although it has un-
dertaken to set-up an alumina-
plant in Queensland “as soon
as practicable,” it has not
seemed a business proposition
to lay out money on a new
ingot-production plant in this
part of this world while the
global oversupply of the metal
continues.
Consolidated Zinc, which is
registered in the United King-
dom, with active dealings in its
shares on Australian Ex-
changes, owns all the shares in
Zinc Corporation, Ltd., which
was formed in 1905 to treat
the 19 p.c.-zinc residue-dumps
at Broken Hill. Later, through
amalgamation with Broken
Hill South Blocks, Ltd., it
acquired some neglected min-
ing-leases, and is now the
biggest producer of lead and
zinc on the Broken Hill field.
Other cos. controlled by Con-
solidated Zinc include Imperial
Smelting Corp., Sulphide Cor-
poration, Titanium and Zir-
conium Industries Pty., Terri-
tory Enterprises Pty. (Rum
Jungle), and it has a 50 p.c.
interest in B.H. Associated
Smelters Pty., a 51 p.c. interest
in Interstate Oil, Ltd., and 60
p.c. of the shares in Heron’s
Creek Timber Mills Pty., sup-
plying timber to the Barrier
mines. It has a substantial
interest in New Broken Hill
Consolidated, Ltd.
As half-owner of Comalco,
Consolidated Zinc’s future in-
terest in Bell Bay has been
discussed in the market-places
for some time. The Bell Bay
Bayer-Hall combined alumina
and reduction plant had a
capacity of 12,500 tons of
aluminium ingot annually. As
a correspondent pointed out in
B. 24/ 8/ ’6O, the plant there
could, with comparatively little
further expenditure, be ex-
panded to produce up to 50,000
tons of ingot annually.
Consolidated Zinc has offered
£10.9 million far the Bell Bay
plant (later to be transferred to
a co. owned one-third by the
Tasmanian Government and
two-thirds by Con. Zinc), and,
at an additional cost of £9.4
million, proposes to raise
capacity to 28,000 tons, and
later to between 40,000 and
50,000 tons. There is to be a
down-payment of £2{ million,
with the rest payable over 16
years at 5 p.c.
Tariff protection on output
is asked for over a pefiod of
four years only.
The decision of Consolidated
Zinc to move into Bell Bay
seems to resolve some of the
questions raised by “Old Open-
cut” in B. 24/8/60. As half-
owner of Comalco, it is un-
likely that Con. Zinc would
now sponsor any early outlay
on plant to produce aluminium
ingots in Queensland, or New
Zealand, for that matter, in
view of the present world over-
supply of aluminium.
Consolidated Zinc has an
issue of 10,185,696 £1 ords. and
7,581,340 4\ p.c. cum. prefs.
For Australians it has the dis-
advantage of being a sterling
company subject to British
dividend - tax. The £1 ords.
have been selling recently at
975. (Australian currency).

The wages-cost problem has

Added-up, these factors
provide reasons for a R .
assessment of booming share
prices and a reconsideration of
investment values.
So far there has been a mild,
general decline in Australian
share prices. Against the
general trend there have been
some strong upward mow
ments and some sharp reverse;
caused by surprisingly good
or unexpectedly bad fortunes
of particular companies.
These movements against
any general trend in the share
market are likely to continue
as trading-figures for tie

is understood to have received
a report from the French In-
stitute team which completed
its preliminary investigations
two months ago.
The Minister has not yet
brought the subject before
Cabinet but is expected to do
so in the very near future,
While the contents of the
report have been closely
guarded, it is understood to
make some favorable points,
although mentioning that
much more remains to be done
before oil can be expected to
be found in commercial quanti-
ties.
It is believed at least one
member of the French team
will return to Australia, prob-
ably early next year, to carry
out further investigations.
Trust Investments
CJir Clifden Eager came up
in Melbourne with the sug-
gestion that Governments
should consider some safe
extension of the present limited
field of authorised trust invest-
ment in the interests of bene-
ficiaries in estates of deceased
persons and under trusts and
settlements.
Unless specially provided,
the scope of investment of
trust moneys is strictly limited
by law; it does not include
investment, Sir Clifden pointed
out, in shares of public or
private companies or invest-
ments of many other kinds that
are commonly regarded as
sound and businesslike.
Sir Clifden Eager is chair-
man of the Equity Trustees
Executors and Agency Co.,

former, longtime President of
the Legislative Council.

manager of Bon Marche, on
his return from America this
month said that “self-selec-
tion” merchandising is basic-
ally the grocery-supermarket
method applied to department-
stores.
The trend towards self-selec-
tion merchandising (known as
“help-yourself” shopping) is
well advanced in the U.S.,
where the old method of having
assistants behind the counter
was fast being superseded
except in stores catering for
high fashion.
Marcus Clark’s have bought
modern home-furnishing stores
at Wagga and Tumut (N.S.W.)
and plan to extend the range
of goods carried.
A lease of a large area in
the new St. Ives (Sydney North
Shore) shopping-centre project
has been taken by the com-
pany’s North Sydney store,
Hobson’s Pty., Ltd., and a new
store will be opened there.
A former showroom at Lith-
gow is being relocated and con-
verted into a specialty branch-
store.
A new finance company—
Marcus Clark Acceptance Co.,
with a nominal capital of £1
million—has been established
to handle the company’s credit
business.
The Adelaide store, Miller
Anderson, Ltd., has been re-
organised and replanned on the
most modern lines,
This month a further new
appointee to the board has

Lawler himself with the
characters. What was not fully
realised was that John Sum-
's «’$ interpretation was not the
[ only one permissible ; indeed,
j Miss Felgate’s fresh approach,
f it at all indebted to the Trust
' tradition, preserved a better
balance between the two themes
-the relationship between
Barney and Roo, and the
tragedy of Olive, with its
Bnbbi Ryan contrast. Only
the Olive story came out fully
in the professional production,

D ot more pathetic for that
very reason. Stan Smith’s Roo
was far more acceptable than
the Trust’s last Roo, who
looked as though a day’s hard
work would have terrified him.
Speaking of Roo, most
people found the ending in
earlier productions unsatisfy-
ing. This was the result of
a certain softening-up in
Sumner’s direction. Rho d a
Felgate, however, did precisely
as Lawler directs in his script,
and the result was not only
convincing but inevitably right.
Could there be another
Emma after Ethel Gabriel?
Eunice Hanger, an actress
usually given to understate-
ment, showed that there could
be. Nothing in her Emma
seemed derived from the
famous Emma; it was a
graphic portrayal in its own
right.
A word for the set. Also
following Lawler’s prescrip-
tion, it had enough drabness
when denuded of its dolls,
butterflies and souvenirs to
make one realise just how much
impact the two vital, sunburnt
northerners must have made on
the drabness of the women’s
Melbourne lives —a contrast,
incidentally, which the movie,
by its substitution of Sydney
as the locale, couldn’t make.

Societa Corelli
In Musica Viva’s Saturday
concert at Sydney Town Hall,
the glorious largo of Vivaldi’s
D Minor Concerto (Op. 3, No.
11) and the adagio of his Con-
certo in G, with its premoni-
tion of Beethoven’s way with
pastoral atmosphere—Vivaldi’s
ability to characterise music, in
short —had it all over Corelli’s
sober meditations in D,
and Martini’s academic effici-
ency in G. The adagio of the
Martini piano concerto, an
early version of the present-day
concerto (in which Mirella
Zuccarini was the soloist),
showed how far it was still to
go to the loveliness of the one-
finger slow movements Mozart
set against delicate orchestral
backgrounds.
Slow 'movements dominated
the evening ; after the “Boister-
ous Bouree” and “Playful Pizzi-
cato” of Britten’s “Simple
Symphony’’ it was a subsidiary
theme in the “Sentimental Sara-
bande,” taken nobly on Silvano
Zuccarini’s ’cello, that stopped
the work jumping up and
down, clapping its hands and
exclaiming “Goody-goody! ”
The verve and precision of
the group’s playing throughout
the evening was enhanced may-
be by their being on their honor,
without a conductor. To see
the leader of the first-violins,
second-violins or violas at
various times in the evening
bend himself backwards and
forwards into the tempo before
starting a movement was almost
to believe in musical democracy
—but one noticed that nobody
ever started anything without
first securing a slight nod from
Silvano Zuccarini, the ’cellist;
he was Mr. Big.
* ♦>
Markevitch in Brisbane
One of the finest of the
Queensland Orchestra’s recent
concerts came from its brief
association with Igor Marke-
vitch. Of late this orchestra
has been sounding a little thin
and tired, and has suffered (as
any orchestra might) from
inevitable comparison with the
unsurpassable brilliance of the
Boston Symphony.
Yet under Markevitch we
heard a richer, fuller and
altogether livelier sound than
other guest - conductors have
been able to produce. What’s
more, his programme ranged
wide, and at the end there was
the satisfaction that comes
from a long emotional journey
in music.
The most controversial per-
formance was of the Pastoral
Symphony. Markevitch took
a curiously small - scale
approach to Beethoven’s high
spirits in the first movement,
going so slowly as to give the
impression of trying to distil
the very last drop of beauty
from the simple and profound
score.
The orchestra played more
beautifully than it has for a
long time, but the essential
plan of the work had been
altered, and we had two slow
movements instead of one.
Later, in the storm scene,
Markevitch worked-up a
shattering climax, full of elec-
trical energy. The music then
fell away quite naturally to
the “Shepherd’s Thanksgiving,”
played with a swinging rhythm
that lost force only in the
closing bars.
Not the least part of an excit-
ing concert was the appearance
of Rostropovitch as soloist in
the brand-new ’Cello Con-
certo by Shostakovitch. He
played at almost continual
white-heat, tearing away at his
strings like someone possessed.
It was very gripping music on
the platform, and only time
will tell whether its repeated
hammering at rhythmic phrases
will sound inspired or repeti-
tious. No better exponent can
be imagined than this mild-
faced Russian ’cellist who plays
with a fury that quite dramati-
cally melts away into sounds
almost angelic.
A welcome performance of
the “Prelude and Liebestod”
from Wagner’s “Tristan”
showed the orchestra in another
good light, and at the end there
was the short and brassy Verdi
overture to “The Force of Des-
tiny.”

“King David”
Honegger’s modern oratorio
—it could also be called a
“dramatic psalm”—got an air-
ing last week from the Sydney
Orchestra and the Hurlstone
Choir, with four soloists and
two narrators, all under the
baton of Nicolai Malko. By
and large, the performance had
more merits than defects.
The work, tightly-knit and
charged with drama, has few
moments of that austerity
which so much of Honegger’s
music suggests. His strong
sense of realism is given play

in a whole armory of clever
instrumental devices, and the
woodwind-writing is at times
quite distinguished.'
In a note on this work the
French musicologist Roland-
Manuel said that Honegger,
among other influences,
“evoked the style of Handel.”
This could be true as to poly-
tonality ; it certainly isn’t so
far as Handel’s gift as a melo-
dist goes. The work is a
punishing one for the soloists,
who at times are forced to
sing long stretches quite bare
of melody. But some of the
choral writing has power and
•originality, and it was per-
formed with forthrightness
and balance —the male section,
though outnumbered, valiantly
stepped-up its volume as
required.
Valda Bagnall used her
clear, light soprano with judg-
ment ; Yvonne Minton’s con-
tralto achieved a good depth
in her “Handmaiden” song;
Allan Ferris lifted a strong
tenor accurately ; and boy-alto
Hans Meissner, though too
light in weight, put a voice of
quality into his brief assign-
ment.
Most of the narration fell to
Moray Powell, who, serene of
voice for the most part, put
a dramatic edge to it when the
occasion warranted. Lyndall
Barbour’s “Incantation of the
Witch of Endor” was a hair-
raising piece of shrieking emo-
tion.
The orchestra handled a
difficult score well, and Malko
suitably kept volume damped-
down whenever the soloists
had the stage.

Country Drama Festival
Last week’s finals of the
N.S.W. Country Drama Festi-
val —held at Turner Hall, Syd-
ney Technical College—showed
how important to amateur pro-
ductions is the choice of play.
The general standard of act-
ing was good, but Alan Sey-
mour’s “Swamp Creatures”
(winner of the Australian-play
“Aye, it makes a bonnie Wee noise , Jock, but wha ’ aboot
the electricity-bill?"
section), done by the Nowra
Players, and Pamela Hansford
Johnson’s “Corinth House,”
Tamworth Dramatic Society’s
choice, did not lend themselves
to cohesive performances. The
best-balanced plays produced
the best productions: Peter
O’Shaughnessy’s lively and even
production of Anouilh’s “Ring
Round the Moon,” and Astrid
McAusland’s prizewinning pro-
duction of “The Love of Four
Colonels.”
“Swamp Creatures” is a play
with five very different charac-
ters, who in the Nowra Players’
production tended to remain
individual cells of action, with
too little interplay and com-
posite effect.
Following this performance,
the evenness of the O’Shaugh-
nessy production, with its apt
and colorful set, was very
marked. It did, as adjudicator
Neil Hutchinson pointed out,
lack the sophistication one
would expect from members of
French society, but this was the
only flaw. Russell Smith
handled the dual role of Hugo
and Fredric very capably, and
Rae Linder was delightful as
the half-witted Capulat; apart
from the lack of sophistication
the only disappointment was
that Robin Gooden, as Isabelle,
could never quite convince
that she could have been the
belle of the ball.
Despite the success of this
play, first-prize went to the
Bathurst group for its produc-
tion of Ustinov’s “The Love of
Four Colonels,” and Ted Evans,
as the Wicked Fairy, took the
prize for best actor. This was
certainly a very good perform-
ance and a very ambitious one,
but it did lack some of the
evenness of the other —the
wicked fairy coming out of his
part occasionally to show the
actor as himself.
An outstanding minor per-
formance was that of Michael
Kluge, as the French colonel,
who had both a polished accent
(the Russian and American
colonels laid theirs on too
thick) and an easy manner and
movement.
Prize for best actress went to

ance as Mrs. Beauclerc in

% vy J t(le crest of the
creation a L French film-
"!s touching and
beautiful adaptation of the
Orpheus legend was written by
the Brazilian playwright
Vinicius de Moraes and made
by Marcel Camus, a director
who mixes down-to-earthness
with an extraordinary poetic
concept.
It is set in the poverty-
stricken Negro quarter of Rio
de Janeiro. Eurydice, a beauti-
ful young Negress, comes to
the city from her village to
shelter with her cousin from a
stranger who has threatened
to kill her. She meets a Negro
tram-conductor —a handsome
and gay fellow popular with the
girls—and they fall in love.
The pursuing stranger, adopting
the mask of Death at the
city’s great carnival, com-
passes her death ; jealous girls
stone Orpheus as he carries
her body away and plunges
with it over a precipice.
The pressure of the tragedy
is most cleverly built-up; the
carnival scenes are a series of
brilliant kaleidoscopic pat-
terns behind the final scenes ;
the Hades guarded by Cerberus
becomes a place where fanatical
spiritualists summon-up ghosts ;
and, as if supplying the master
cadence, drums throb to the
delirious whirling of dancers
intoxicated with the carnival
spirit.
Breno Mello is a manly
Orpheus ; and Marpessa Dawn
is demure and sensitive as his
ill-starred love.

“The 400 Blows”
A new French director,
Francois Truffaut, blends
imagination, strong realism and
an uncanny insight into a boy’s
mind in this penetrating study
of schoolboy delinquency in
Paris.
The delinquency, which be-
gins with truancy and goes on
to theft and a reform-school,
stems from a home-life in
which the boy feels himself
both a prisoner and an in-
truder. His amoral mother,
who never wanted him, makes
brutally plain her impatient
detestation of him. His father
is a moral coward who, aware
of his wife’s looseness, is too
afraid and too apathetic to
do anything about it and is
indifferent to the boy’s plight.
Skilful studies of the parents
are supplied by Claire Maurier
and Albert Remy. But the
boy himself, played with beguil-
ing naturalness by Jean-
Pierre Leaud; his mates, all
hardened prematurely to the
facts of life because of simi-
lar defects in the home ; the
hard actuality of the class-
room sequences; and the gener-
ally poetic use of the camera —
these are the chief attractions
of a film which gets its mes-
sage across with uncompromis-
ing economy and drive.

“White Wilderness”
Having by now examined in
minutest detail the creatures of
desert, mountain, sea and air,
Walt Disney, in this latest
nature-study film, turns his
'telescopic lenses onto the
fauna of the frozen wastes on
the fringe of the Polar ice-cap.
There are grim glimpses
but not too many —of the
tooth-and-claw aspect of the
struggle for survival and the
culling of the weak. The
strange periodical mass-suicide
of the lemmings is portrayed
very thoroughly ; wolves shep-
herd migrating caribou into a
narrow mountain-pass for
easier slaughtering. But these
are offset by some delightful
touches of humor, such as
Polar-bear cubs donging one
another with snowballs, and an
egg-thieving ermine trying to
push an egg uphill with his
snout.
As in “The Living Desert,”
Disney brings to light an
astonishing variety of life in an
area where one would suppose
it to be scarce. The commen-
tary is without flamboyant
embroidery.

At May 31, the latest date for which
*** figures are available, the national
h.-p. debt amounted to £416,117,000 —a
jump of £65 million in one year. It
remains to be seen if the mildly defla-
tionary Budget, and the curbs on bank-
lending, will dampen the volume of
hire-purchase transactions.
The problem hinges on supply of
loanable funds. The Reserve Bank’s
anti - inflationary credit - restrictions im-
posed on the trading - banks should
increase the aggregate demand for hire-
purchase finance and push-up interest-
rates. The crucial problem is whether
the h.-p. business as a whole will be
able to raise enough money to finance
the rising volume of h.-p. contracts.
Another question is the extent to which
possible increases in lending-charges may
curtail demand.
Competition in securing funds to lend-
out (and customers to borrow them) is
intensifying. Careful diversification of
business may pay-off in the long-run.
Custom Credit Corporation, Ltd., one
of the most dynamic of h.-p. cos., was
incorporated in N.S.W. in July, 1953.
Since then paid capital has increased
from the initial public-issue of £150,000
to £7,000,000. The co. operates a diversi-
fied h.-p. business in all the States and
is closely associated with the National
Bank of Australasia, which holds a 40
p.c. share-interest in the concern.
Subsidiaries include Customlife
Assurance, Ltd., National and General
Insurance Co., Ltd. (with a branch in
London), Pivot Investment Corporation,
Ltd., and the newly formed Custom
Credit Properties, Ltd. (builder and real-
estate dealer), and First National Rein-
surance of Australia, Ltd. (handling
reinsurance “not previously available
except through overseas interests”).
Business was buoyant last year, and
the parent and subsidiaries did well.
National and General Insurance im-
proved its net profit before tax by
£49,000 to £409,000 (up 14 p.c.). Custom-
life Assurance wrote £26,000,000 of
policies in its first year. A surplus of
£16,000 was carried forward after pro-
viding for a reversionary bonus of “up
to £2O per £lOOO assured.”
Custom Credit Properties is investing
in land and buildings, and will shortly
start work on a 20-suite luxury-motel
at Surfers Paradise (Q.).
Consolidated profit before tax for the
year ended June 30, 1960, increased by
£468,000 (or 19.8 p.c.) to £2,830,882 after
writing-off £53,916 for depreciation (up
£15,887).
After providing a generous £1,107,488
for taxation (up £168,736) consolidated
net profit was £299,868 higher at
£1,723,394:

This was equivalent to an earning-rate
of 34.5 p.c. on average capital employed,
compared with 28.4 p.c. in the previous
term, and 33 p.c. in 1958 and 26.2 p.c.
in 1957 (both on lower capital).
Div.-rate was steady at YJ\ p.c.
(£875,000). Reserves benefited by
£848,394 and also by £5771 capital
profits.
There were numerous adjustments.
Reserve for unexpired risks was down
£45,427 at £1,467,329 and £21,454 was
transferred to life-department. Another
£114,272 was deducted as income-tax
on premiums. Insurance reserve was
£2570 higher ; general reserve increased
by an unexplained £65,701, and £17,566
was added on acquisition of a subsidiary.
Intangibles increased by £92,316, leaving
total reserves and undistributed profits
at a net £4,067,574.
Funds employed registered a substan-
tial rise. Loan capital (excluding
£2,304,656 sundry creditors) jumped by
£11,698,460 to £52,490,704 (4.74 times the
shareholders funds less intangibles) in

Unearned income (including insurance
charges) almost doubled, rising hv
£8,089,677 to £19,086,168. This repre-
sents 22.7 p.c. of total outstandings on
h.-p. contracts, which increased bv
£22,897,003 to £84,024,804. The ratio
(18 p.c. in the previous term) is satis-
factory, as normally about p.c. of the
total h.-p. debt is considered adequate,
Fixed assets, shares in other cos.,
sundry debtors (non h.-p.) and cash, etc’
increased. The corporation appears to
be in robust financial condition.
At the end of last term paid capital
was lifted by £2,000,000 to £7,000,000
by the issue of 8,000,000 ss. ords. two-
for-five at par. The new capital, “issued
in order to continue the rate of growth
and expansion,” was not available for
last year’s business.
Alert management, ample funds and
diversification of interests into allied
fields augur well for the future. Past
record is impressive. A lot depends on
general economic conditions, but at
present prospects look promising. There
appears to be some long-term scope for
further capital-gains for the investor.
Sharemarket rating is high. At the last
sale in Sydney the ss. ords. changed
hands at 19s. each. The immediate yield
is 4.6 p.c. on the basis of the 17) p.c.
div.-rate.
Net tangible asset-backing works out
at 6s. lOd. for each ss. unit on the
consolidated accounts.

The Australian brewing industry, by
the middle of the nineteenth century,
comprised many small brewers scattered
throughout the various colonies. The
present century has witnessed a process of
aggrandisement, and the Swan Brewery,

the export market, and, in the long-term,
population growth.
Last term the Swan Brewery disposed
of three of its hotels. Management con-
sidered “that it would be uneconomic
to modernise them or to operate them
in their present condition.” Prospects for
the current term are favorable. The
change in licensed-hours in W.A., effected
last January—lo-o’clock closing is in to
stay, with no meal-break between 6 p.m.
and 7 p.m. —is contributing to “a more
pleasant and gracious method of living.”
The economic outlook for both industry
and commerce in W.A. is looking up
with general all-round benefits going the
way of most Sandgropers.
Balance-sheet movements indicate a
very strong financial structure back of-
the Swan Brewery, but they are, at the
same time, difficult to follow under the
new set-up:

The book-value of freeholds, leaseholds

£1,967,764 to £7,238,990. They are in
at cost or valuation, less provisions for
depreciation and amortisation and should
be reckoned as very conservatively stated.

tion provision is no longer shown, its
exclusion adding one more mystery to

Australian General Insurance
/''Originally sponsored by the Mercan-
tile Mutual, the A.G.I. has been in
business for 46 years writing fire, marine
and accident policies. Operations are re-
stricted to Australia, and this seems to
have paid-off in the past five years. Head-
office is in Sydney, and the scrip is listed
in Sydney and Perth.
Last term was highlighted by a sub-
stantial rise in net premium income and
by the issue of 50,000 15s. contribs.,
l-for-5 at par, in April, 1959. A further
l-for-3 par issue of 100,000 15s. contribs.
last June lifted paid capital to £300,000.
The board prefers to issue new scrip
rather than call-up the liability on con-
tribs. (shown as an “uncalled reserve” in
the accounts).
Gross premium income for the year
ended December 31, 1959, increased by
£162,500. Net premium income (after
deducting reinsurances) was £147,173
higher at £847,749.
Claims increased by £59,954 to
£450,899. The number and cost of motor-
vehicles and workers - compensation
claims continued to rise. Expenses, in-
cluding “taxation in all its various
forms,” went up by £43,994 mainly due
to increased business written:

1959 .. 847,749 450,899 294,158 53.2 29.5
The basic ratios improved. Claims,
although higher in volume, represented
53.2 p.c. of net premiums, compared with
55.8 p.c. in the previous term. The ratio
of expenses to net premiums dropped
from 35.7 p.c. in 1958 to 29.5 p.c. in
1959.
Income from investments was £7343
higher at £39,259. Underwriting surplus
was £4225 stronger at £21,192 after
appropriating £81,500 to reserve for
unexpired risks (up £39,000) which was
lifted to £381,500, equal to an adequate
45 p.c. of net premiums (42.8 p.c. in the
previous year).
Total net income amounted to £60,451
(up £11,568), representing 26.9 p.c. on
the higher average paid capital, com-
pared with 27.4 p.c. in 1958, 27.1 p.c.
in 1957 and 26.9 p.c. in 1956. Under-
writing surplus was equivalent to 7.5
p.c. on the average capital (9.5 p.c. on
lower capital in 1958):

£28,124. Reserves benefited by £32,327,
rising to £735,177 (including £381,500
reserve for unexpired risks).
The pattern of investment is important
because the A.G.1., in common with
many other soundly-financed offices,
tends to regard investment-income as
the principal source of dividends, and
ploughs-back underwriting-surpluses.

Barragoola, on Cape
York Peninsula, Queens-
land, like a number of
other places still shown
on maps of the region but
which, in fact, have long since
ceased to exist as human
habitations, had been quite a
town, “a 20-pub town,” to
describe it according to dis-
trict usage in declaring the
prosperity of old mining towns
of the North.
But all that remained of the
glory that had been Barra-
goola’s was a street of creaking
rusty ruins, mostly collapsed
through the ravages of ter-
mite, tempest and fire, some
splendid heaps of bottles and
a flock of lonely goats. How
the goats hung on there resist-
ing the murderous attacks of
the dingoes was a mystery.
Perhaps they were sustained
by the hope of the eventual
return of men, their only
friends. That seemed not
unlikely, the way they would
come running, crying their
joy, whenever a human came
among them.
As Barragoola lay a long
way off the main road to
Coen, the centre of such
civilisation as there is on the
Peninsula, the goats saw few
humans. That is, before the
new era of human interest in
the place with which this
narrative deals. Earlier, the
only people who had passed
that way were those going to
and from the couple of cattle-
stations away to eastward, and
odd prospectors.
Even these had become
rarer. Station people had
taken to travelling by air, and
the ranks of prospectors had
dwindled with the passing of
old-time methods of mining.
Not that the new era brought
so much consolation to the
goats, because it really didn’t
affect the town at all. Cer-
tainly Barragoola was put
back on the map as a reality
instead of a memory, but as
an aerodrome, now ; not as
a town.
The Barragoola aerodrome
owed its existence to the for-
tunes of war. It had been
constructed during the Pacific
war for use in emergency. The
peculiar meteorological condi-
tions that build-up over the
mountains to eastward and
southward often force back
aircraft flying down the Penin-
sula to Cairns. During the
early part of the campaign
planes of the Australian and
U.S. services were lost in the
vicinity for want of facilities
for emergency landing. So
an air-strip had been laid,
built with all the war-time
heedlessness of cost.
It was its very excellence,
to preserve which would entail
expense out. of keeping with
peace-time economics, that
had caused the authorities to
let Barragoola aerodrome
become extinct with the town
it was named for. In that
state it had lain for years,
slowly identifying itself again
with the wilderness through
the encroachment of grass and
scrub and ant-hill —till sud-
denly it was brought back into
seryice by him who came to
be called “A.T.C. Barragoola,”
otherwise known as Nathaniel
Ah Matt.
A -T.C., meaning Air Traffic
Controller, is the title of
those officers of the Depart-
ment of Civil Aviation respon-
sible for controlling aerial
traffic. Such officers operate
only in centres where such
traffic is concentrated.
Old Nat Ah Matt, operating
his salvaged airport away in
the wilderness, was given the
title in affectionate jocularity
by the bush-pilots whose un-
official convenience he served.
Actually he held no official
post at all ; nor, until that day
when drastic circumstances
caused him to put the Barra-
goola air-strip back into ser-
vice, had even had any part
in aviation.
It was as a prospector that
old Nat had come to Barra-
goola, to hole-up there during
the Wet-season while working
the gully for the bit of gold
always uncovered by the
rains.
One morning, at his sluic-
ing down by the old battery,
he heard an aircraft flying low,
and took a look, to see, indis-
tinct in the cloud-wrack, a
light plane circling the old
aerodrome. As he learned
later, the plane came in almost
out of fuel from battling to
cross the mountains.
Because the aerodrome was
half-a-mile away, with the
ruins of the town intervening,
he did not see what happened
when the aircraft landed. But
he heard it, and leapt into his
battered truck and drove as
he had never dared drive that
old wreck before. Had he not
acted thus, the two occupants
of the plane would certainly
have perished ; for in landing
it hit an ant-hill, smashed its
undercarriage, crumpled-up in
rolling over, then burst into
flames.
There was much more to
the rescue of those two moo
than simply dragging them
from the burning wreck. They
both had broken legs, besides
other injuries, and must o
got to hospital as soon o
possible. Travel by m*
just then, when the thyfv
were quagmires and the ere

entual| y the pilots of all
the other light aircraft operat-
ing in the region were doing
likewise. Bush-pilots are a
starved tribe, on the go as
they are from first light to
last; if not too busy to eat,
then too tired.
Nat’s culinary specialities
were camp-oven roasts of the
provender of the locality—
kid - goat, or wild - duck or
goose taken off the billabong
that had been the town dam,
or fat bustard out of the gully,
served with the sweet-bucks
and pumpkin he grew.
As a cook, he could have
made a much easier and far
more lucrative living than he
had had as prospector. In
fact, in his long pursuit of
the elusive nugget he had often
to do a spell of cooking on
some cattle-station or in some
mining-camp in order to acquit
himself financially. He might
have had a permanent job
cooking anywhere he liked,
with the best of living-
conditions. When asked why
he preferred to suffer the hard-
ships of prospecting, he would
reply, blinking his mongoloid
eyes and pulling at his lank
mandarin’s moustache, “Aw,
the outdoor life suits me.”
The fact of the matter was
that he was by nature unsuited
for cooking as a calling; at
any rate, for cooking in the
bush, where dealing with
forthright characters in the
raw state of hunger calls for
forthrightness of a special
kind. Those who knew Nat
Ah Matt for the amiable and
retiring old fellow thfit he
was should have known better
than to ask him that question.
But why prefer prospecting
to any other pursuit?
Lone prospectors, for all
their propensity for living in
solitude, are not usually of
the retiring type, as witness
the lavish good-fellowship
they invariably show when
they make a strike, and that
truculent misanthropy of their
disappointed age which earns
them such names as “mad-
hatter,” “death-adder,” “scrub-
bull.”
Prospectors are essentially
dreamers, dreaming of a state
of perfect existence to be won
with the finding of the pot of
gold at the rainbow’s end.
They crowd their solitude with
their dreaming. They do not
want company unless they may
shine in it.
Nat Ah Matt was like that,
for all his insignificance of
personality and smiling self-
effacement. Probably hi s
complex of inferiority stemmed
from his being of mongrel
breed. What exactly his breed
was no one knew. He was
not native to the region and
avoided discussion of his
antecedents. Certainly he had
Chinese blood, and some other
that made him copper-skinned,
perhaps aboriginal.
His deep need to shine was
surely proved by the way he
seized upon that first bit of
importance he had had in his
65 years and more, and per-
petuated it by framing the
evidence on his wall.
"IVat had never flown before
he became involved with
the flying fraternity there at
Barragoola. He took his
first flight off the Barragoola
runway with one of those
pilots he had rescued.
The effect on him was pro-
found, summed-up in his
comment: “To think a man’s
been crawling about the
country like a blooming
goanna, when he could’a been
flying over it like a heagle!”
It was in the style of an
eagle that he got about the
country subsequently. By the
time his friends the flying
geologists left the district,
Barragoola had become
included in the radio-network
of the Aerial Ambulance. He
had only to ask for transport
and the first ambulance or
charter aircraft passing that
way with a seat to spare would
call for him. When his job
with the geologists was
worked-out he applied for the
old-age pension. He always
flew to Coen to collect his
dues. Sometimes his flying
took him to the limits of the
region, to Cairns, to Thursday
Island.
He came to talk aviation
like one of the fraternity, so
that his cronies in Coen would
say to him in greeting: “Well,
how’s the flying-game, Nat?”
and would wink at each other
while, innocent of being
strung along, he discoursed in
his ponderous way. Not that
he was really regarded as a
figure of fun. What his cronies
truly felt about him was
revealed in their saying among
themselves that it was good
to see a lonely old fellow so
happily occupied.
He still lived very much
alone, by the general standard.
Even though he might expect
his aeronautical friends to
drop-itt on him at least once
a week, he could rarely hold
them for much longer than
it took to feed them. Cer-
tainly these brief visits, filled
with engine-noise and the
inevitable vocal exuberance
of aeronauts, were lively
enough to dispel the effects of
a week of solitude.
The trouble was that the
solitude closed in heavier than
ever for having been so rudely
dealt-with. At least, that was
how it might well seem to
anyone of ordinary sociability.
That was how it did Seem
to one of his earth-bound
visitors, a prospector named
Ben Larkin, who remarked to
Nat, after seeing the Aerial
Ambulance off with him:
“The quiet kind o’ comes down
and belts you under the ear-
’ole, don’t it? It’s a wonder
you don’t get the ding-willies
living ’ere on your Pat
Malone.”
'T'here was nothing of thd
-*■ solitary about Ben Larkin,
despite his calling.
Ben declared that he hated
solitude, that he never worked
without a mate, that he had
endured life in the wilderness
only in the hope of acquiring
means to live among people
in what he called “style.” He
claimed to have made several
rich strikes in his career and
to have lived-up every penny.
Even now, about to go on
the old-age pension, he was
planning a lively future in
some place where there would

CLOTHING LIMITED
Chairman s Address
IT GIVES ME great pleasure to present the
Accounts of the Company for the first nine
months in its existence as a Public Com-
pany. You will recall that in the original
placement of shares to the public it was
envisaged that p.a. would be paid.
The initial dividend after three months as a
Public Company was 2d. per share which
was at the rate of 13 1-3 %, and now the
final dividend which you are asked to ratify
is 4fd for the last six months, making the
dividend rate 13%. This I think is a most
gratifying result.
Since the Balance Sheet sales have in-
creased over the corresponding period of
last year by at least 50% and it is antici-
pated that the Company will have no
trouble in maintaining the present rate of
dividend.
Our Managing Director, Mr. Emeric
Rusti, visited Switzerland, France and the
United States and was able to secure some
new synthetic dloth which our Company
will show at the same time in Australia
as it will be released to stores in America.
Our Co-Managing Director, Mr. A. Menczel,
is in the United States at the moment to
make purchases for 1961 and to finalise
some pending matters. It is anticipated
from their visits that there will be many
new lines placed on the market before
Christmas.
Owing to the expansion of the business
generally, the Company will need more
capital and it is proposed later on to issue
fully convertible Notes. You will be advised
of the conditions of these Notes at a later
date.

' Products’ accounts for
year to March 31 were good,
but not especially exciting.
Profit was £130,832 up at a
record £839,600. The increase
was 18.5 per cent., against
28.7 per cent, the previous
year. It owed a good deal
to a reduction of £154,642 to
£146,894 in special deprecia-
tion provision. Ordinary
depreciation was £4161 down
at £643,214. Gross operating
profit rose by £83,135, or 3.5
per cent., to £2,428,768. In
the previous year it rose by
£96,244, or 4.3 per cent.
Other income was £53,309
higher at £160,715. Expenses
increased by £53,409 to
£314,125 and tax was £110,906
up at £645,650.
Preference dividend of 5|
per cent. takes £116,819,
leaving £722,781 to cover the
7 per cent, ordinary dividend
of £364,296 just on twice,
Buoyant trading conditions
were experienced during the
year, the chairman, Sir David
Henry, said,
By the end of 1962 the com-
pany expects to harvest and
use a million tons of logs
annually, but in order to use
the full forest crop it will be
necessary eventually to con-
vert more than double this
amount into marketable
products.
Further information on the
proposal to establish a pulp-
and-paper-making plant in
Canterbury is expected to be
available to shareholders at the
annual meeting.
A decision on the granting
of licences to Canterbury
Pulp and Paper Mills, Ltd., a
company formed for that pur-
pose, will probably be given
in October or November.
N.Z. Butter for Australia?
N.Z. butter should be sent
to Australia because Austra-
lian farmers were pricing
butter off the market, causing
dumping in England, said Mr.
Maher, Opposition Member
“Are you shipwrecked, or Writing a bestseller ?”
for Otaki, in the House of
Representatives recently.
Mr. Maher said he would
like a licence to export some
butter to Australia himself.
“It’s nonsense complaining
about European countries
dumping in England when our
sister Dominion, Australia, is
doing the same thing,” he
said.
The Minister of Agriculture,
Mr. Skinner, said there was
nothing to stop Mr. Maher
exporting butter if he wanted
to, but he would first have to
find a buyer.
‘‘l don’t know if N.Z. butter
would be sold below the
ruling retail price if it were
sold in Australia,” he said.
“The prices are controlled by
the State Governments.”

be good company as well as
good fishing and good living,
say Cooktown or Port
Douglas, his hope of the
wherewithal to do things “in
style” being centred in the
Golden Casket Lottery.
He had just parted with his
last mate, whom he had put
dying aboard the Aerial
Ambulance over at Cassowary
station in the mountains. He
had dropped-in on Nat, of
whom he had heard, while
passing through in his old
utility on the Way to Coen.
There was no winking when
Nat talked aviation to Ben
Larkin: and it was not simply
because there was no one to
wink at out there at Barra-
goola save the kites perched
on the goat-yard fence, but
because old Ben was genuinely
interested. As he put it him-
self : “I likes to learn new
things. I got no proper
schooling. My time, all they
was to learn was connec’ed
with hard yakker. Tell me,
man, what makes them things
fly with no visible means o’
support? I’ve often won-
dered.”
When Nat had demonstrated
the theory - of flight, as he had
had it himself from the
experts, using sheets of paper
to show how lift results from
the flow of air over a convex
surface, old Ben’s faded blue
eyes shone in his ruddy face
and he brought down a great
red fist, exclaiming: “Well,
what d’you know ’bout that!”
And he spent hours playing
with sheets of paper on his
own.
Ben stayed-on at Barra-
goola, right welcome in the
beginning because of his frank
pleasure in his host’s all-
abiding interest, and no less
at home there even when it
should have been obvious to
him that the welcome had
worn pretty thin.
Flattered by Ben’s seeking
to share his interest, Nat
eagerly showed him how to
make an estimation of the
weather and give the daily
report over the radio. So
interested -was Ben that he
assumed the role of assistant
A.T.C., and such his disposi-
tion that he failed to realise
that his co-operation was
being resented.
Ben also co-operated in
entertaining the visiting aero-
nauts ; or rather, took-over
that department from Nat,
except in the matter of feeding
them. It was natural that he
should do so,, being of so
much more forceful character
than Nat.
Poor Nat became simply
the cook.
As a broad hint of his feel-
ings, Nat drastically reduced
the quality of the meals he
prepared for Ben and himself.
But it had little or no effect.
Ben only said: “A man
getting hup in years hought
’o heat sparin’ly. I read
where rich food gives you
hardening the art’ries.”
Nevertheless, when the good
food was on for the pilots he
shared it with gusto.
Nat took to reminding him
of the essentially transient
nature of his interest in what
went on at Barragoola by
talking of those places Ben
had mentioned when speaking
of his retirement, Cooktown
and Port Douglas, and by
stressing the fact that Ben
would have to consider the
matter of the weather in
travelling. Nat said, “You’ll
have to get a move on if you
don’t want ’o have to hole-
up in Coen for the Wet.”
No suggestion of holing-up
at Barragoola.
Ben always answered that
he would get going when the
spirit moved him, and sounded
genuine enough in his inten-
tion to go. If further proof
were needed of that intention,
it was surely to be found in
his continual harping on what
he considered Nat’s folly in
working as he did without
reward. He would say
emphatically, “Not for mine,
man, not for mine!”
C|till Nat fretted in his
ineffectual way, perhaps
because he knew there was a
reward beyond reckoning and
it only remained for Ben to
discover it to make the usurpa-
tion complete. The reward, of
course, was flying with the
aeronauts.
Old Ben discovered it when
a charter-aircraft dropped-in
to take Nat up to Coen to
collect his pension. Ben went
along, too, not at the invitation
of Nat, but of the pilot, who,
taken by his exuberant
interest, had him up in front
with him, leaving Nat to sit
behind.
Ben had flown before, but
never with a pilot who took
him up for a peep into the
black caverns of a thunder-
head or down to see lotus-
birds running on the lily-pads
of billabongs ; who let him try
his hand . with dual-control.
As he said in the pub at Coen
after landing from that
fabulous flight, speaking to
the habitues while Nat hung
unnoticed in the background,
“I felt like a millionaire flying
me own hairyplane!”
There followed another mil-
lionaire’s flight back to Barra-
goola. Old Nat was com-
pletely out of it. Even while
he cooked the dinner, Ben and
the pilot were outside studying
the threatening sky, talking
“Q-nim,” “condensation-level,”
“super-cooling.”
Nat peered out at them with
mongoloid eyes drawn down
in misery.
When the pilot took leave
of them, it was only too clear
that he gave the thumb’s-up
sign to Ben.
“Nice laddie that!” Ben
shouted above the din of the
departure. Then, as the uproar
receded with the plane’s
running to the strip, he
added: “Nice laddies all of
.’em . . . princes among men.
If I had me time over again
I’d be one of ’em.”
They watched \the take-off,
waited for the inevitable
“beat-up,” waved a last fare-
well, and stood to watch the
silver bird climb into the sky
to southward and vanish in
the clouds.
As the silence came down
Ben said: “Gosh . . . the
quiet!” Then he cocked an
eye at a thunder-head rearing
over the mountains to east-
ward, saying: “Twenty-
thousand foot o’ Q-nim there
. . . twenty-thousand foot o’
steam and ’lectric’ty all ready
to bust. Amazing, ain’t it!”
For the first time in a long
while Nat spoke, in a voice
vibrant with repressed feel-
ing: “The storms’re coming
up. You’ll ’ave to be getting
away from ’ere this week, or
you’ll be bogged down ’fore
you gets to Coen, even.”
Ben eyed him for a moment,
then clapped him on the
shoulder, saying with a
chuckle: “I ain’t thinking o’
travelling no more, mate. I
made-up me mind to stay
right on ’ere with you.”
Nat blinked, gasped: “Eh?”
The big red hand on Nat’s
thin shoulder ground him
down with rough affection as
its owner declared himself:
“You need a mate. It ain’t
good for a man to spend all
the time you do here on your
Pat.”
Staggering under the pres-
sure of affection, Nat gasped:
“I like being on me own.”
“What, with that old town
just over there creaking and
groaning in the wind like all
the ghosts o’ all the poor
devils that must ’a’ died here
for a c°o r iXree S . Bat H

there? You’d just have to lie
there for the ants and the
crows and the dingoes. What
if you got bit be a snake!
You won’t get to no radio
with a taipan-bite.”
Ben dropped his arm about
the drooping shoulders and
gave Nat a bear’s hug, saying:
“No, mate ... I don’t want
’o go butting-in on you, if
you don’t want me. But 1
reckon you do want me. You

the other side of the story
Having regard to the success of Automatic Merchandising overseas and the huge volume of
business arising therefrom, this Company has investigated the potential of this virile
industry as related to Australia. Our research, backed by the existing response to the
industry by the Australian public, confirms our confidence that Automatic Merchandising
is on the threshold of tremendous expansion in this progressive Country of ours. The
prospects were never so bright.
0 RELATIONS WITH THE PUBLIC
We believe that the Australian public should be given the
opportunity to participate in the growth and profits of Auto-
matic Merchandising in this Country. It is our intention to
make it possible for all members of the public to invest in
the industry.
OUR ATTITUDE TO THE INDUSTRY
We intend to confine our activities to Automatic Merchandis-
ing. Our entire efforts will be confined to the industry in
which we, and the public, have so much faith. May we make
it perfectly clear that we are not financiers, nor do we intend
to apply the public’s money to ventures other than our own
particular industry.
OUR ATTITUDE TO THE LAW
The Companies Act 1936-1960, effective since the Ist June,
1960, was established to protect the public in this and other
types of investment. We have already and we will in the
future comply fully with the provisions of the Act. We do
not seek and have never sought ways to avoid or to be excluded
from the Act. All our offers will be backed by legal prospec-
tuses. Automatic Merchandising in Australia is a multi-million
pound industry. The public should and must receive the
utmost security and protection. There are many ways of
making money, the right way must, in the long run, be the
most successful.
OUR INVESTMENT POLICY

COMPANY’S ACCOUNTS
As a Public Company we are required by law to disclose
certain financial statements regarding our operations. We are
not permitted, nor do we wish, to conceal these facts from
interested parties. Further, we will publish interim trading
accounts from time to time for the Public’s information. We
feel confident that it will be to our advantage to do so. We
believe in prosperity through progress. This Company will
be pleased to keep you the Public informed about our progress.
ONE COMPANY POLICY
The sale of machines will be made by us and the leasing of
them will also be done by us. All obligations are directly
secured by Automatic Sellers (Australia) Limited, whose
balance sheets are open to inspection and must be published,
being a Public Company.
OUR POLICY FOR EXPANSION
Plans have already been formulated for early expansion to all
States of the Commonwealth. The only limits to the rate of
our expansion will be those conducive to wise and prudent
management and administration.
LONG-RANGE INDUSTRY FORE-
CASTING
Automatic Merchandising has been an active industry in the
United States _of America for some thirty years. Recent
detailed surveys show that the industry, despite tremendous
growth, still has unlimited potential. Peak development and
saturation point are not yet in sight. In a hundred years’ time
automatic merchandising in Australia will still be an expand-
ing and progressive industry. We are not here for today,
but for ever.
OUR POLICY IS BASED ON SERVICE
The very nature of the industry is based on service to the
retailer and to the public. Automatic Merchandising brings
more goods and services to the public, where it wants them,
when it wants them, at lower cost and in greater volume.
Our policy of service, as contained in our contract, extends
this theme of service to the investing public. In an age of
automation we help to provide the outlet for greater volumes
of consumer goods manufactured by modern efficient methods.
Automatic Merchandising will be the factory workers’ greatest
friend.
OUR ATTITUDE TO THE PRESS
We openly invite the Press to investigate our proposition and
we are more than willing to discuss our methods, services,
finance, etc. We make it a very important point that we have
nothing to hide and every question will be clearly answered.
The above Statement of Policy was approved by the Board of Directors
of Automatic Sellers ( Australia) Limited on the 27th day of July, 1960.

What the New Means-test Means
Pensions and Thrift
When a Labor M.P.
gets on his hobby-
horse and talks of
t h e Government’s
“callous” treatment of the
“pore old pensioner” he will
as likely as not drag in a
reference to the work of the
“pioneers” who made this
country what it is. This senti-
mentalising doesn’t help the
pensioner; nor does the
attempt to make pensions a
matter of party politics.
A man becomes eligible for
the age-pension (presuming he
satisfies other requirements) at
65; a woman at 60. This
means, at the present time, men
and women born in 1895 and
1900 respectively, and who be-
gan their working lives well
into the present century. Most
of the pioneering of this coun-
try had been done well before
they were born and well be-
fore pensioners 10-20 years
older had begun to work.
Hardworking, honest and
reputable most of today’s pen-
sioners probably were, but
they weren’t pioneers.
At June 30, 1959, the num-
x ber of persons receiving
age, invalid or widows’ pen-
sions was 647,348, and the
total amount paid out of the
National Welfare Fund under
these headings was
£140,348,574. In the financial
year 1959-60 the pay-out in-
creased to £159,142,589 and the
estimated cost for the current
year is £171,800,000. In addi-
tion the Budget provides for
an expenditure of £4,686,000
for medical benefits for pen-
sioners and £7,680,000 phar-
maceutical benefits.
It is not suggested that the
earning sector of the commu-
nity is not wealthy enough to
meet this cost, but it is desir-
able that it should realise that
it does meet it —and. that it
will have to find the additional
money to meet any increases.
The money to provide for the
aged and infirm has to come
eventually out of the earnings
or savings of the young, fit and
able.
In the absence of a National
Insurance Scheme a big pro-
blem will always be posed by
the conflicting factors of needs
and deserts. If no means-test
is applied then the sum which
will enable one man of 65 to
put jam and cream on his
bread and butter may not
ensure that another gets even
his full requirements of bread.
On the other hand if the
means-test is too stringent it
will penalise thrift and may
have the effect of killing the
incentive to save.
In recent years the tendency
in approving additions to the
pensions pay-out has been to
apply the money where it can
do the most immediate good.
Supplementary payments to-
wards the costs of rent and
payments for the children of
invalid pensioners are examples
Table showing the effect of the new “means-as-assessed” system
in comparison with the old means test. At each property-level the
top figures show the new pension payable per annum, the bottom
figures the old rate.

of this; so are the special
medical and pharmaceutical
benefits for pensioners. At the
same time it is realised that as
the system now operates the
person of modest means is dis-
couraged from saving towards
the end of his earning-life.
VJG'hen a man of thrifty habits
approaches 65 and rea-
lises that despite his savings
he will be no better off than his
neighbor who has enjoyed the
same income but has spent the
lot, it is not surprising if he be-
gins to look around for some
way of circumventing this
apparent injustice.
A trip abroad, which he
would formerly have thought
beyond his means, suddenly
becomes a way of eating his
cake and having it, too —or
at least having the same income
he would have had if he had
forgone the trip and thus re-
mained eligible for the full
pension. Another way of over-
coming the means-test has been
for a man to use his savings
to buy an annuity. Fede-
ral members haVe openly
admitted giving advice of
this sort to constituents who
have put their cases to them.
Abolition of the means-test
would be a very costly action,
but in framing this year’s Bud-
get the Government was
obviously mindful of the need
to do something to correct this
tendency towards a “final fling”
and to restore the incentive
to save. On this point the
Treasurer said:
A structural change will be made
in the means-test which will remove
what has been widely regarded as
an anomaly in the operation of
the means-test on property as
compared with the means-test on
income . . . Whereas in the past
two independent means - tests
operated—one on income and one
on property—the new means-test
will take into account one com-
posite figure representing the pen-
sioner’s “means as assessed”. . .
[which] will comprise the pensioner’s,
income, which by definition does
not include income from property,
together with a property com-
“e £l Tl ?o r P e r a ° c r Co^ t

A S an exam Ple a person wl
property valued at f 2200
(exclusive of exempted™,
perty) will now receive a pen-
sion of £242 a year, compared
with £6O a year on the old
scale. Earned income ryjj|
reduce this figure correspond-
ingly £-for-£, but income pro-
duced by the property wil/ not
affect the pension.
When the new system be-
comes operative conditions
governing age-pensions will be
as summarised here:
Australian citizens of 20 years’
residence, subject to certain quali-
fications in regard to property and
income, will be entitled to a pen-
sion of £5 a week on attaining
the age of 65 in the case of mils
and 60 for females. The Hi
shows that the pension is decreased
progressively, disappearing (in tit
case of a person with no outside
income) when the property hi!
exceeds £4620 or (in the case ol)
person with property valued at
less than £200) when the outside
income reaches £442. The no!

Caulfield
Lord, Melbourne’s best
w.-f.-a. galloper up to a middle-
distance, won Saturday’s
Memsie Stakes for the third
year in succession, thereby
emulating the great Ajax.
Lord is practically unbeatable
at Caulfield, where he has
gained 17 of his 20 wins. In
Saturday’s victory, which took
his stake-earnings to £33,744,
he took-up the running after
going two furlongs, and was
never in danger, cruising home
a length clear of Olive Branch,
who shaded Nilarco by a neck.
From a Cups’ view the minor
placegetters in the Memsie Stakes
were most impressive. Prior to
his first-up run at the Valley last
Saturday week Olive Branch was
favorite for the Caulfield Cup.
He lost a lot of friends when he
finished third to the little-known
Prince Lupus, but his grand run
behind Lord lifted him back to
one of the most fancied runners,
and he has only 8.5 in the big
race.
There was no money for Nilarco,
but there will be many anxious
to support him next start. Seventh
at the turn, he finished very
strongly. Last autumn Nilarco won
the V.R.C. St. Leger and Queen
Elizabeth Stakes. He has 8.12 in
the Caulfield Cup, 21b. less at
Flemington. The Caulfield should
be hjs target.
The much-boomed New Zea-
lander, Ilumquh, went poorly, and
he will have to put in a good run
soon to hold his place in the
Cups’ market. Smokey Jane,
fourth, and But Beautiful, fifth,
went well enough to please their
connections, but the three-year-old
Reinsman looked anything but a
Derby hope.
* • • t
Never an easy race to win,
the Caulfield Cup this year
looks like attracting an out-
standing field. For that reason
form amongst the class of
handicappers that contested
the 12-furlongs Doona Handi-
cap isn’t of much importance,
though trainer C. Cerchi
regards the winner, Malarno,
as a useful second-string to
the stable’s star, Olive Branch.
Malarno had not won over a
distance before, but he finished with
a lot of courage to score narrowly
from consistent old Royal Somme.
Malarno drops a stone from the
8.10 he carried on Saturday. He’s
at his best on a heavy track, but
even if he strikes going to his
liking in the Cup he’s likely to
find the class too rich.

Anonyme. Racing first -up
from a long spell, the huge
son of Landau was backed
from sixes to 7-to-2 favorite,
and justified the support with
a clear-cut win.
Anonyme looked to be carrying
a lot of condition, and can cer-
tainly be improved. In the autumn
he ran third in the Oakleigh Plate
and second in the Newmarket,
good efforts for a three-year-old.
A race like the Hallmark Stakes
on Derby Day, the rich (£6000) six-
furlongs sprint, looks made to order
for him. He has only 8.10 in
that event, against the 8.13 he
carried on Saturday. Trainer Jim
Pengilly expects Anonyme to get
a mile this spring, and has the
Toorak Handicap in his pro-
gramme. However, Anonyme’s
dam, La Patrice, did not like it
past six furlongs, and that may be
as far as her son will go.

Grand Print, who won the mile
Warriston Handicap for three-

by that good Australian horse
Carbon Copy, from Darling by
Le Grand Due (Fr.). It was
Grand Print’s first win, but his
courageous finish suggested it
will not be his last. However,
he is still growing, and trainer
Jack Besanko will sensibly
turn him out for a spell.

The 10-furlongs Heatherlie
Handicap has at times given a
lead to the Caulfield Cup, but
that’s hardly likely this year.
Optic Prince, who has been
rated a Cup hope, started
favorite, but he put up a dismal
performance, and, unless there
was a reason not readily dis-
cernible, he can be dismissed
from Cup calculations. The
winner, Well Spent, carried 8.4.
He has 7.11 in both Cups, but
on his record is not class
enough.

which she picked -up the

home in the first division of the

top-class miler of a few years
ago, from Valiant Caste by
High Caste from Valiant
Mate.
Dream Note, who won the
second Glen Eira, is a most
improved filly. She has run on
each of the last three Saturdays,
for a second and two wins.
She’s by Chavey Down (imp.)
from Top Note, who has some
notable blood in her veins,
being by High Peak (imp.) from
Chantant by Manfred from
Stagegirl by Comedy King

in her wins by Courtney’s 16-

ADDITIONS
RUSSIA AND CHINA
on rumors of a
deepening ideological rift
in relations between Russia
and China, which freshened
after reports of an unusually
large withdrawal of Soviet
technical experts from China,
Edinburgh “Scotsman” remarks
that “Sino-Soviet disagreements
are no less inevitable than those
which occur from time to time
between the members of the
Western alliance, but owing to
the vast differences in the his-
tory, civilisation and outlook,
and in the stages of economic
development of the two coun-
tries, it is probable that they
will ultimately prove far more
profound and far-reaching in
their effects.
“On such questions as that of
the Chinese Communes China
and Russia could easily afford
to agree to differ. The con-
troversy over the possible
diversity of the ‘paths to Social-
ism,’ which embraced this and
many other matters of internal
policy, was solved in practice
if not in theory by the fact that
each Government goes its own
way. The conflict between the
policy of peaceful coexistence
and the doctrine of the inevit-

END OF CONTRACT?
ability of war between the
Commu n i st and capitalist
worlds is, however, another
matter.
“If anything, the heat of the
controversy has increased since
the Summit failure. The meet-
ing of Communist leaders in
Bucharest in June was believed
to be partly intended to thresh-
out the question. But it can
hardly have been successful,
for the Soviet press has since
kept-up and increased its
attacks on so-called Left dog-
matists, sectarians, opportunists
and narrow nationalists. The
object of the attacks is not
mentioned by name, but the
doctrines attacked are those
which the Chinese leaders alone
are reputed to espouse.
“In public, however, the
Chinese position is, as always,
highly ambiguous. Only [last
month] Chou En Lai pro-
claimed his adherence to the
policy of peaceful coexistence,
calling for a peace-pact and a
denuclearised zone in Asia, and
the ‘People’s Daily’ followed
suit two days later. How can
this be squared with the doc-
trine attributed in Moscow to
the Chinese?
“Firstly, the latter is an un-
popular and demoralising doc-
trine in almost any country.
But, secondly, the doctrine is
not that Communist countries
should launch a war. It is that
the ‘imperialist beast’ will re-
main warlike and aggressive
and become more so as Com-
munism ‘inevitably’ spreads.
The Russian doctrine is that as
Communism inevitably spreads
it will become strong enough to
deter the imperialists.
“The battle. of quotations
from the Marxist classics, in
which the Chinese show the
skill of theologians, appears to
be vieux jeu in Moscow, where
the Khrushchev line that what
Marx or Lenin said in a par-
ticular context or set of circum-
stances cannot be applied
mechanically to the vastly
different situation of today
seems to be generally adopted.
It is clear enough that China
has the power to obstruct and
upset Soviet foreign policies,
and that the more powerful she
becomes the more effectively
she will be able to do it.”
That reports of the with-
drawal of Soviet experts from
China should be viewed in the
context of this ideological clash
is only natural, notes Victor
Zorza in the Manchester
“Guardian”:
“The official Chinese ex-
planation reported by Tanjug
[the official Yugoslav press-
agency] from Peking was that
the Russian exodus was due to
the expiry of the experts’ term
of service, but, it added, there

the kind of interpretations to
are being put on the new
the present case.
‘‘On June 2, 1954, P e%
Radio announced that far J
rallies were being held m
honor of Soviet experts in
China who _ had been recalled
by the Soviet Government to
participate in the construction
of Communism at home.
‘‘Though Soviet assistance to
China is always referred to
with gratitude in the Peking
press, there have been some
indications in recent months
that China is putting itself in
a position in which it could
dispense with some of this
assistance. The pronounce-
ments of Chinese leaders and
articles in the press now put
as much emphasis on the
development of agriculture as
on heavy industry. There has
been criticism of those who fat
tO’ see the importance of agri-
cultural development and who
are determined to put the pre-
dominant emphasis on hear;
industry.
“This new stress on agricul-
ture is not only a reversal of
the orthodox Communist order
of priorities: the Chines:
leadership might conceivaf

Spring is a glorious season, and the Australian
air is full of it now.
Life takes on a new excitement in everything
that is in and around us. The earth is starting to
be sun-warmed; flowers begin to cluster in their
colour, grass shoots, the crops are rising, and trees
that had been leafless in winter have burst into
blossom, and leaf.
The little wood lizards are pursuing the
warmth in shy corners of my garden, and Mitzi,
my dachshund, is fairly chasing herself with daily
sprees of activity.
This is a time when we can count anew the
many blessings we enjoy in this country, and set
ourselves freshly to the task of its development.
It is a truly favoured opportunity that God
has given us. Australia is nearly three million
square miles in area, and covers more than thirty
parallels of latitude on the surface of the Earth.
By its very size and situation it is a land of
wide variation in climate. Tropical heat in summer,
alpine cold in winter, as we have had this year,
are at the extremes of its seasonal scale.
Yet, through the absence of really high
mountains, and on the general geographical form
of the Australian continent, we have a more
temperate climate than most other countries, even
those in corresponding degrees of latitude above
and below the Equator.
This is the kind setting in which we find
ourselves, in a world astonishingly advancing in
knowledge and discovery, and at a time when the
years are leading us into a future when very much
will be expected of us.
They are years in which the “invisibles” of
existence —such as faith in ourselves, and our
influence on events in the world—will be of greater
importance in the working out of the human story
than material assets and physical power.
And this is the scene upon which Nature now
puts its freshness to re-touch our sense of those
eternal values which are so vividly expressed in the
coming of Spring.

The Poole Case

existed in Kenya, as elsewhere
in colonial Africa (and in some
parts of the U.S. where Negroes
have been executed for the rape

have escaped the death-penalty
for the rape of Negro women).
What is more, until lately the
Africans’ complaint has been
justified. Nous avons change

“Yesterday Poole would
have been almost automatically
reprieved because he was the
white murderer of a black man.
Tomorrow, his color and that
of his victim will be irrelevant.
But today, reasons of State
demand that African opinion
be shown that the law is ad-
ministered, where Britain’s writ
still runs, by men who know
the color of the future.
“To reprieve Poole, the argu-
ment appears to have run,
would seem like an admission
that Britain still holds white
life dearer than black. To
execute him will demonstrate
that she holds white life cheaper
than black opinion. It is a
savage irony that future genera-
tions in Kenya will be able to
point to 1960 as the year when
the equality of the races was
finally demonstrated, not by
the granting of rights to
Africans to farm on the White
Highlands, or to become mem-
bers of the white clubs, but by
the proposition that all men,
regardless of race and color,
are equal on the end of a rope.
“Justice is commonly por-
trayed as blind ; one day, she
will also be color-blind; but
not, it seems, just yet.”
Holland and Indonesia

Soekarno’s breaking of diplo-

“Ever since the independ-

Soekarno has headed every
list of post-colonial folly and

which we [Britain] have had

outstanding than our support
of the delivery, with quite
indecent haste, of so rich an

at all, it cannot be wondered
that Holland
refuses to hand-over West
New Guinea to President
Soekamo’s peculiar mixture
of tyranny and anarchy.
“Breaking - off diplomatic
relations with Holland is
hardly likely to change
Netherlands policy, since they
have not existed in any fruit-
ful form for many years.
Indonesia has already done all
the damage she can to Hol-
land, having seized all the
commercial fruits and ex-
pelled most of her remaining
citizens. President . Soekarno’s
powers of blackmail, in short,
no longer exist.
“Nevertheless, West New
Guinea does constitute an as
yet wholly unresolved prob-
lem, since Dutch plans to
grant such a non-viable entity
independence make very little
sense. Perhaps this is another
candidate for United Nations
supervision. If the experi-
ment works in the Belgian
Congo why should it not be
tried in Dutch New Guinea?”
Edinburgh “Scotsman” sees
the dispute over New Guinea
as “hopelessly mixed-up with
the resentment on other
grounds which has continued
since Indonesia became inde-
pendent and which has already
led to the severance of nearly
all other ties.
“If Indonesia were in better
shape, enjoying stable gov-
ernment and developing in
orderly fashion her valuable
economic resources, her claim
to Dutch New Guinea would
be considerably stronger. The
natural and obvious political
association of West New
Guinea is with Indonesia,
already a complex of peoples,
even if' it is true that the
primitive Papuans have in the
past had little but marginal
contacts with the Indonesian
Malays. But the Indonesian
Government have had as- much
trouble as they could handle
in holding together their
immense and scattered terri-
tory. These very difficulties
they continue too readily to
lay at the door of the former
colonial Power.
“Indonesia was certainly ill-
prepared for independence by
the former paternalistic rule of
the Dutch, and the conflict
which preceded her achieve-
ment of independence left
bitter memories. But she had
much to gain from a con-
tinued economic association
with Holland, which a solid
sense of material interest
would have led her to main-
tain in any case.
“President Soekarno’s
attempts to develop a form of
government which can im-
pose on Indonesia the disci-
pline necessary for bringing
order out of the perennial
chaos have not perhaps had
as much sympathy as they
deserve. The real doubt is
whether he is the man to do
it. His prestige among the
masses is still unrivalled and,
whatever his shortcomings, it
is likely that any leader lack-
ing his popularity would have
to go much further in the
direction of dictatorship.
“Indonesia’s financial chaos,
which would have brought a
more developed country to its
knees, has by no means
proved disastrous to a people
many of whom do not depend
on money, and who are by
Asian standards quite well
fed. This as much as any-
thing may be the reason why
rebellions, in geographically
very favorable territory, have
failed.”

effect. Since May the Ameri-

have become increasingly suc-
cessful in launching satellites ;
since May the era of recovery
from orbit has begun ; every
day, it seems, satellite instru-
ments are becoming more
accurate, more penetrating and
more sophisticated. Not only
is it becoming more and more
unlikely that either the Ameri-
cans or the Russians will seek
to conduct espionage from
high-flying aircraft. It is also
becoming more and more
absurd for either side to protest
against espionage conducted
from still higher-flying satel-
lites. Protest as they will,
neither side can do anything
about it. The U-2 was caught,
sure enough. As a vehicle for
espionage, it is already obso-
lete.”
* * *
London “Observer”: “Now
that the drama is over, Mr.
Khrushchev should think again.
He must realise that the show
of Soviet indignation over
espionage in general convinces
no one, in view of Russia’s own
record in this field. The
Powers flight and the subse-
quent American handling of
the-affair were serious political
blunders which contributed to
the Summit failure, but the U-2
flights have been stopped, and
it is inconceivable that Presi-
dent Eisenhower’s successor
should order them to be re-
sumed.
“If Mr. Khrushchev is still
seriously interested in a detente
and in eventual East - West
negotiations, he should now let
bygones be bygones and help
to prepare a better East-West
atmosphere by mitigating the
sentence on Mr. Powers and
releasing the surviving members
of the RB-47 plane (whose case
is in no way comparable with
that of Mr. Powers).
“He should also end the
sterile campaign to frighten
America’s allies and friends
into believing that the United
States Government is not
merely liable to err, but is
controlled by dangerous war-
mongers.”
Welfare and Suicide
Ts there any validity in the
A old argument that Sweden’s
high suicide-rate indicates a
malaise induced by too much
social-services security? When
President Eisenhower lately
implied that it could, Professor
Herbert Tingsten, writing in a
Stockholm paper, produced
evidence, here summarised
editorially by the Manchester
“Guardian,” that it couldn’t:
“From 1951 to 1955 the
annual number of suicides per
100,000 of the Swedish popu-
lation was 17.3, which was an
increase of 2.6 on the 1941-45
figure. But the rate has been
Stable and comparatively high
for a long time: it was 16.5
in the years 1906-15 and as
high as 17.7 during the five-
year period before the First
World War.
“Professor Tingsten com-
pares the 1936-40 figure (16.3)
and the 1941-45 figure (14.7) to
suggest that statistically it can
be ‘proved’ that the will to
live of the Swedish people grew
stronger as social democracy
consolidated its position. Most
of the suicides are elderly
people, and the recent upward
trend can be related to the rise
in the average age of the popu-
lation.
“But if the Swedish figures
prove little by themselves they
prove less in comparison with
those of other countries.
Japan, Austria, Denmark,
Switzerland and Berlin all have
a higher rate than Sweden’s ;
Ireland, Bulgaria, Poland, Hol-
land, Italy and Norway have a
lower rate. (The figure for
England and Wales in 1956 was
11.8; for Scotland and
Northern Ireland in 1957, 8.2
and 3.6 —suggesting that the
full weight of the Welfare
State has yet to be felt on the
Celtic perimeter.) Suicide is
three times as prevalent among
whites as among Negroes ; or
again, as Professor Tingsten
says, the statistics could be
used to show that oppression
and a low living-standard
stimulate the will to live. But
President Eisenhower probably
does not wish to commend
poverty and oppression.”

Department when you came
there. I never saw so much
happen so quickly.”
In fact, in his brief five
weeks in that department
Goodsell had reorganised
systems right and left, and
was just getting around to
changing furniture, amenities,
etc., when a job he had pre-
viously applied for was put
on his plate.
This was Public Service
Board inspector, and in this
he really found himself. He
had previously been restless,
looking for opportunity; he
had also been aware of his
shyness as a definite handicap
and had made conscious efforts
to overcome it. Now ambition
and ability could run side-by-
side, and the very nature of
the job ripped his shyness
away.
With the P.S. Board he
became one of a team often
referred to as “Wallace
Wurth’s bright young men.”
Others were R. H. Hicks,
already mentioned; S. W.
Ramsay, now Under-Secretary
for Justice ; C H. J. McKin-
non, secretary *of the Educa-
tion Department; N. J. White,
formerly N.S.W. Prices Com-
missioner and now g.-m. of
L. J. Hooker’s Australian
Land Trusts Pty., Ltd. ; R. E.
Garbutt, N.S.W. Land Tax
Commissioner; K. E.
Grainger, Commissioner of the
Commonwealth Public Service
Board; and Neil Thomson,
Public Service Commissioner
in Papua-New Guinea.
A fter three years as a mem-
ber of the P.S. Board,
Wurth had become chairman
at, for that position, the re-
markably young age of 43. He
was destined to reshape the
whole public service, and one of
his first moves was to gather a
young and eager team around
him. Under his leadership a
subtle change came over the
workings of the board. It had
been the custom for inspectors
to report on ills in the public
service and to seek the advice
of the board. With Wurth’s
shrewd encouragement the new
school of “bright young men”
came more and more to report
the ills —and to prescribe the
cures.
Goodsell became inspector,
and then senior inspector. He
was dynamite. He became
known as Wurth’s special
trouble-shooter, and it was
certain that any department in
trouble could expect a visit
from him.
He went through the
organisation, staffing and
method-surveys of every
department in the N.S.W.
public service. In the same
period he had a large part in
setting-up the war-time
National Emergency Services,
the State War Effort Co-
ordination Committee, the
Charcoal Production Organisa-
tion, the State Dockyard and
the State Housing Commission.
Still in the same period he
was responsible for the com-
plete reorganisation of the
Child Welfare Department, the
Treasury, Public Works
Department, Grain Elevators
Branch, Premier’s Department,
Supreme Court Offices, Gov-
ernment Printing Office, State
Clothing Factory, State Motor
Garage, Forestry Commission
and others. He also saw to
the reorganisation and integra-
tion of the Health Depart-
ment, Hospitals Commission
and Mental Hospitals into one
centrally controlled body.
When he was set loose on
the Treasury he found it old-
fashioned and bogged-down
in detail with nearly all work
being done by hand. He
mechanised it with accounting-
machines, etc., and transferred
the detail to other departments,
leaving the Treasury what he
thought it should be —the
financial and business manager
for the Government.
An account of his work
hardly gives a picture of the
man. He was ruthless in his
demand for efficiency. A con-
temporary records an illumin-
ating incident:
Goodsell —he will neither
confirm nor deny the story —
was troubled about a particu-
lar institution and, one Sun-
day afternoon, said to his wife,
“These organised inspections
are no good—everything’s
ready for you. I’m going to
now.”
He took-off by train and
taxi and arrived at the place
to find it was worse -than he
had feared. He put in a hell-
busting report, and Wurth,
impressed, decided on a com-
mittee of inquiry. But
Goodsell was after blood. “An
inquiry will go on and on,”
he said. “And these condi-
tions will go on with it. You
must clean it out now!”
And so it happened, fol-
lowed by a very comprehen-
sive reorganisation of the
entire department.
valued frankness
’ ’ from his inspectors very
highly, and he certainly got
it from Goodsell.
All trace of the shy young
clerk on horseback had
vanished ; he was more like a
galloping Nemesis throughout
the public service.
Each P.S. Board inspector
had a portfolio of departments
to watch-over, and Good-
sell’s list had a habit of grow-
ing larger and larger. Wurth
used to say to him, “See me
in the morning and I’ll take a
few off you.” In the morning
Wurth would run through the
list: “I’m afraid that’s yours
. . . we can’t give that one
to anyone else . . . you really
know about this one,” and so
on to the end of the list. Then,
“Sorry, I can’t cut it.”
His time as P.S. Board
inspector touched-in another
permanent aspect of Good-
sell’s character —almost a para-
dox in view of the stringency
of his criticisms. As an angry
watchdog over departmental
efficiency he saw the insides
of most of the State’s prisons,
mental - hospitals, welfare-
homes and othpr ;

Goodsell has always kept
the poster, and although he
shows it with a laugh these
days, there still seems to be
a faint undercurrent of worried
suspicion—as though he
regards it as some deliberate
plot and not one of those
errors, however unpardonable,
which can happen in the rush
of daily-press work.
Goodsell’s term as P.S.
Board inspector ended in
1946. He was working on a
report for Wurth one night
when he was asked by phone
to deliver it personally to
McKell, then Premier.
Goodsell had never met
McKell, and the Premier,
head down and writing, kept
him waiting for what seemed
an interminable time. Then
he looked up, took the report,
and slowly and deliberately
surveyed Goodsell from head
to foot.
“That’s all,” he said.
Goodsell wondered why
he’d been asked to deliver the
report in person, but shortly
after he went to the Treasury
as Officer-in-Charge, Budget
Branch. It had been McKell’s
way of seeing how he shaped-
up in person to the written
recommendation.
Shortly afterwards, when
McKell was appointed Gover-
nor-General, McGirr came in
as Premier. He and Goodsell
had had differences previously,
and the strain persisted for a
while. Then McGirr’s attitude
changed overnight. The
moment he made up his mind
that he had an able and loyal
adviser in Goodsell he swung
completely the other way and
rarely made a decision with-
out asking, “What does the
Treasury think?”
Goodsell became Under-
secretary when J. G. Lee
retired, and he and McGirr
developed a strong mutual
respect. McGirr transferred
the construction of Housing
Commission homes on a day-
labor basis from the Works
Department to the Treasury
and they were completed
below outside contract prices.
It was quite a triumph, but
when asked about it he always
tossed the credit to Goodsell.
Goodsell’s field broadened
tremendously. The clerk on
horseback finding his way
through the rain-forests now
had the whole field of govern-
ment spread out before him —
most major Government busi-
ness crosses the Treasury table.
As Under-Secretary, Goodsell
was at all Premiers’ Con-
ferences and Loan Council
meetings ; he was in close con-
tact with practically every
Minister and with members
of Parliament and depart-
ments ; in conferences he
became used to hearing
McGirr tell his Ministers,
“The Treasury holds your
purse-strings.”
who followed
McGirr, was sceptical of
the Treasury, and it fell to
Goodsell to persuade the new
Premier to change one or two
ideas.
Cahill sometimes told of the
meeting . . . He sat behind
his heavy desk in the Premier’s
room the lar g e, dark-
panelled room redolent with
history. ,
Goodsell held the floor,
talking, talking, talking, talk-
ing. Cahill, poker - faced,
stared, stared and stared.
Finally, with an effort to con-
trol his feelings, he said, “Are
you sure of what you’re say-
ing?” Goodsell said, “Of
course, I am.” Cahill didn’t
want to agree, but he was a
realist with the courage to
change his mind. He and
Goodsell became very good
friends, and Goodsell was
visibly distressed when he first
heard of his death last year.
When Cahill bee a m e
Premier he faced his first
Premiers’ Conference within
three months, so he used to
take Goodsell for tea in the
back room night after night
for briefing. They went to
the conference together, of
course, along with Bob
Heffron-—Cahill more-or-less
started the practice of taking
the Deputy Premier to sit-in
on these meetings.
At his first conference,
Cahill made such a good
showing that big Tom Play-
ford, until then regarded as
the leader of the Premiers,
waved towards Cahill and said
generously, “Here’s your new
leader.”
Cahill rarely praised people
to their faces; instead, he
praised them to everyone else.
He let most of his Ministers
know that he thought the
world of Jack Goodsell —
“The outstanding Treasury
bloke in the Commonwealth.”
Xlj'ROM the Treasury, Goodsell
went to the Sydney Water
Board, as president. The
Treasury could have been the
peak of his career. From
clerk on construction-jobs he
had risen to confidante of the
heads of government, able to
advise what was, or was not,
possible in the government of
the State. On the way up he
had been concerned with prac-
ticalty every Government
department in N. S. Wales, and
had reorganised a large pro-
portion of them.
A complete and satisfying
career for most men. The
Water Board, however, was to
cut another facet on his
character and thinking.
He succeeded the late Dr.
Upton, who had seen the
board through the aftermath
of the depression and the war
years, when men, materials
and money were hard to get
for construction-jobs. Good-
sell arrived at a time when
building-controls and capital-
issues controls were being
lifted, and he was almost
frightened of the industrial and
residential development that
he knew must follow, and of
the demands it would make
on the city’s water- and
sewerage-systems.
The Water Board is an
autonomous body depending
on revenue from rates for
running - expenses, and on
loans for new construction-
work. Subject to what the

THE OTHER FELLOW'S MIND
How N.G. Natives Fare
In all the surveys lately made
of Papua-New Guinea I have
yet to see anyone, including
visiting professional politicians,
give a realistic report. Most
pick out a particular aspect
without inquiring into the back-
ground..
The natives of Papua-New
Guinea are among the best-
treated in the world today—if
not the best. They have a free
medical service which includes
transport to hospital and village
aid - posts. They have free
education which includes higher
education in Australia for those
who warrant it. Every native
owns land, and usually a house
or a share in a house. His
working- conditions are in-
spected regularly, and condi-
tions are policed far more
rigidly than any in Australia.
His rations while working are
laid-down by law and also
policed regularly.
While employed, a native is
the responsibility of the em-
ployer completely clothing,
rations, medical treatment and
transport being provided. His
fares are paid to and from his
village. Inspectors regularly
visit places of employment and
ask every native individually
if he has any complaint.
No native can be proceeded
against legally for debt. In
any case appearing before the
court the native is given free
legal representation. No native
can sell or give away any land
without an inquiry by qualified
officers of the Administration
who make sure that the native
realises what he is doing or
about to do. If a native’s crops
fail he is given, free, enough
food and seed to tide him over.
Co-operatives are started and
supervised by Government
officials free.
All this and more—and all
the native pays is a recently
introduced head-tax of £2 each
for adult males. Europeans
also pay the head-tax, medical
and hospital fees, transport
costs, education costs, legal and
any other costs. The native
lives in a complete Welfare
State and will never advance
until he is made to realise the
value of the services now given
him for nothing. He is start-
ing well ahead of what it took
Australians years to gain.—
Daika (Papua).
Control of School-children
“D.M.F.’s” claim that the
responsibility for pupils’ con-
duct while travelling to and
“Go and get me some mothballs.”
from school belongs properly
to their teachers in certain cir-
cumstances (B. 17/8/’6O) seems
far-fetched.
The Act plainly states that
parents “shall cause” their chil-
dren “to attend school,” not
merely to set-out for school.
Surely this implies that the
parent is responsible until the
child enters the school and after
he leaves it.
If teachers were responsible,
how could they possibly super-
vise the travelling behavior of
their pupils? Some pupils walk
home ; others go by train, bus
and even taxi; a few in the
country still ride horses to
school. An army of adult
escorts, paid for by the State,
would be needed to do the job.
Surely the question of feasi-
bility has to come into this
matter?
“D.M.F.” mentions that the
principal of the local Catholic
school accepts responsibility
for the travelling conduct of
his pupils. This is to be com-
mended, but the public-school
principal hasn’t the same free-
dom as a private-school princi-
pal. The latter can say to a
pupil: “You can attend this
school provided you obey its
rules, arid one of them is that
you must conduct yourself in a
certain way when travelling to
and from school.”
The public-school principal
has no such freedom, although
at times he pretends he has —to
the advantage of all concerned.
—H.A.K. (N.S.W.).
The Health Scheme
“Medic” (B. 17/8/ ’6O)
appears to have forgotten that
the Commonwealth Govern-
ment’s Free Medicine Scheme
was evolved to assist those in
need of life-saving drugs, and
only life-saving drugs. This is
why certain scripts must be
endorsed “Specified Disease”
or “Specified Purpose,” thereby
preventing the frivolous and
ineffective use of these potent
preparations for

I’ve often heard “Medic's"

ceutical Benefits Act restricts
the physician’s right to pre-

far from the truth; He phar-

Dr. Canning’s letter is typical
of the man—always hard, but
fair, and willing to give credit
where credit is due. No one
has done more to make the Act
workable, and mechanics
appreciate his efforts to force
malcontents among the dentists
to adopt a reasonable attitude
towards the legislation, thus
giving the public a chance to
benefit from it. — Prorsum et
Semper Honeste (Tas.).
The Stuarts and Cromwell
I read with keen enjoyment
Norman Lindsay’s spirited
defence of Charles II and his
father (B. 10/8/’60); but in
calling Cromwell “infinitely
more evil than even a Hitler”
he goes altogether too far.
The Puritans certainly had
an almost pathological hatred
of beauty, whereas the Nazis
showed a nice taste in other
people’s treasures. But a cul-
tured taste, important though
it may be, is not the only, or
the chief, quality we look for
in a ruler ; and one side, at
least, of Cromwell was the
strong, sober, God-fearing man
with a mission to save his
country from the evils that
threatened it. And to some
extent he did. He was the
leader the English found—as
they always seem to find one—
in a time of crisis. But he
lacked what we may call “king-
liness” ; he did not know how
to rule except by force, and,
rather against his will, he de-
generated into a dictator.
I suppose that, as patrons of
the arts, the Italian Renaissance
princes rank pretty high. Their
peculiar virtues and vices prob-
ably reached their peak in
Cesare Borgia, but it would be
hard to maintain that he was
better, as a man or as a ruler,
than Cromwell.
After all, it was Charles I’s
shortcomings that made the
Civil War inevitable. Above
all else he completely lacked
what had been the peculiar
genius of the three great Tudors
—an understanding of the
common people. The most
outrageous acts of Henry VIII
were accepted because people
felt that he was only doing,
in his own way, what they
had always wanted done. But
Charles ignored popular
opinion, and if Parliament op-
posed him he dispensed with
it.
Turning now to that para-
gon of sanity and culture
Charles 11. The hounding of the
“regicides” may be excused
(though hardly applauded), but
I know of no action °f Crom-
well s so uncultured so utterly
barbarous, as the d,gging-up
and hanging in chains of his
mouldering bones by Charles
The whole point is that the
Stuarts have been judged by
history not as patrons of the
arts, not as exemplars of cul-
ture, but as kings. Due to
Whig and Puritan influence that
judgment may have been un-
duly harsh at times, but it was
not unjust.— Magnoon (Q.).
Those Sporting Writers
Sporting prowess is a short-
cut into dan sports+)urnal .
ism but whether , he , is
reached b , ha , ath ‘ r tbc
conven tional one the main
qualifications are the same—a
scorn for all sport - control
bodies, and a knowledge of
how to spell “shamateurism.”
The writers of Sydney s daily
sports - columns seem to be
wasting their talents. Obvi-
ously they could be better em-
ployed getting crowds back to
racing, brightening-up cricket,


putting boxing back on its feet,
and so on. These boys have
all the answers, parading them
regardless of whether anyone
has asked the questions.
Yes, there’s something about
sport that gives its topline
performers a feeling of omnis-
cience. A golfer-turned-jour-
nalist might never have watched
a serious tennis-match, but give
him half-an-hour at White City
and he’s ready to tell his
readers what’s wrong with
tennis administration and why
the foot-fault rule should be
changed.
Journalists in other fields
would hesitate to commit them-
selves on matters they don’t
fully understand, but the sports-
writer suffers from no such in-
hibition. This leads to certain
rewards for the discerning
reader.
Sydney tennis-fans are still
chuckling over the long-ago
blunder of a Sydney sports-
columnist who criticised at a
range of 600 miles the actions
of a tournament referee in
Brisbane.
“The referee had no business
to be on the court arguing with
players,” he thundered. “His
place was up on the high chair,
controlling the game.”
After somebody had broken
it to him that a tournament
referee was not an umpire, the
columnist refrained from com-
menting on tennis for at least
a month.
“ Don't lose your block with me, sire—I only Work here!"
Then there was that classic
comment by a Sydney scribe
on a weight-lifting dispute at
the Melbourne Olympics which
began, “I don’t know anything
about weight-lifting, but ...”
and went on to criticise a ruling
in the best traditions of the
trade.
Racing-journalists have come
up with some gems, too. It
would be hard to beat the
Sydney sports-magazine which,
explaining to punters why a
horse cannot always run true
to form, said: “We should
always remember that horses
are only human.”
A sporting scribe is always
ready to make mountains out
of molehills, and just as ready
to ignore mountains completely
if it suits him better. He never
forgets to say “I told you so”
when his prophecies come to
pass, but is content to keep
quiet when they don’t.
A cricket writer may cheer-
fully spend one season cam-
paigning for young players, to
the jibing tune of “it’s harder
to get out of the State team
than to get in”; but next
season, it suiting hie ,•

“You better hurry. They’ll

Nat disappeared through the
back door. Ben stood for a
moment, scratching the white
stubble on his red chin, then
shrugged and went back to the
radio.
The radio kept Ben for an
hour or more. When he came
looking for Nat he found him
over by the goat-yard with a
carcass hanging from a limb
of the butchering-tree, work-
ing before an audience of
kites perched on the fence.
As if nothing had happened,
Ben squatted in the shade to
relate the gossip of the air.
Nat worked on, silent, stony-
faced.
The only variation in the
routine of the morning was
Nat’s putting on a haunch and
a shoulder of goat to bake
while he grilled chops and
kidneys for midday dinner.
Usually he hung joints for
cooking next day. But Ben,
following him about, talking
all the while, didn’t seem to
notice. After dinner they
retired as usual to their respec-
tive rooms for siesta.
A t least, Ben retired for
siesta. Nat simply sat on
his bed, staring out into the
blazing yard through the
shutter that opened-up from
ground-level. He sat thus till
he heard Ben’s snore.
Then he rose swiftly and
began to gather together his
belongings, to pack them into
a tin trunk and roll them into
the swag he made of his bed-
ding. These he put outside
through the shutter, then
slipped out and took them to
his truck in the shed. There
were more things to get,
cooking-gear and food, includ-
ing the roasts when they were
done, and those framed cut-
tings, and his prospecting-
tools. He worked swiftly and
silently, evidently wanting to
get away before Ben woke.
He might have got away
without fuss, but for having,
as he found upon making a
final check, a flat front tyre.
He was flogging the pump
when Ben came into the shed,
saying, “Hullo. . . going for
water, eh?”
During the Dry-season they
had to cart their water from
the dam.
Nat didn’t answer, but bent
swiftly to release the pump,
even though the tyre was only
half-inflated.
Then Ben saw that the truck
was loaded: “Hey . . . what’s
the hidea?”
Nat pitched the pump into
the doorless cabin, and slipped
in behind the wheel.
Ben came barging up to
him: “Where you off to?”
Fiddling with switch and
choke, Nat muttered, “Going
back prospecting.”
“Eh . . . Aw, don’t be mad!
What’s bit you, man?”
“Just feel like a change.”
The starter growled.
Ben cried: “You can’t go
running 3way. You got a
job here to do.”
“You can do it.”
The old engine started with
a pop, a bang ; stuttered into
a roar, filling the shed with
smoke.
Above the din Ben roared:
“Wait a minute . . . wait a
minute ... we got ’o talk
this out. I offended you or
somepin, eh?”
Nat slipped into gear. The
gears ground, and the truck
moved. Ben clung to it as
if to hold it back. He went
with it, shouting: “Eh, wait
a minute, wait a minute. I
ain’t staying here without no
mate . . . wait . . . which way
you goin’ ?”
Clearing the shed, Nat
yelled: “Cassowary-way.”
“Ain’t nothing to find out
there.”
“Never know your luck.”
“Stop . . . stop . . . wait’ll
tomorrow, I’ll come with
you.”
“I like working on me own.”
“I know a couple o’ likely
prospects . . . wait’ll to-
morrow . . .”
“Might be raining to-
morrow.”
Ben was running, clinging,
panting: “Don’t go, man . . .
please . . . don’t go leavin’
me, mate . . . mate ... !”
“Hooray! ”
Ben was left behind, lost in
red dust.
■jVTAT drove the few-hundred
yards into the main street
of the town, to turn left and
run on northward through the
double line of ruins gaping
through broken windows and
wrecked doors, past live goats
that came forth from hiding,
bleating welcome, past dead
goats lying where the dingoes
had dragged them down by
night and left them as husks
for the kites that now, heavy
with gorgement, struggled-up
into guilty flight.
Nat drove through the town
to the junction where the road
to Lilyvale and Coen ran
westward and that to Casso-
wary station eastward. It was
to the east he turned, to run
down past the battery into the
gully, then to turn southward
and proceed along a rough
track on the western side of
the gully, heading for the
crossing to the east.
Rough as the track was, it
was not so much as to cause
the difficulty with steering he
was having. When he reached
the crossing he stopped and
took a look. The front tyre
he had partially inflated was
dead flat again. As he had
no spare-wheel, there was
nothing for it but to get out
the puncture outfit.
It was no easy job, dealing
with burred old bolts and an
old-fashioned spring-rim that
at first refused to unlock, and
then behaved likewise in the
matter of locking. The time
passed. The sun went beyond
the gully. Then the sky above
the western rampart flamed
with ruby and gold and
amethyst.
Back at the aerodrome old
Ben would be sitting out on
his favorite box, smoking,
talking this evening to the
kites gathered for the night
on the goat-yard fence.
A dingo mourned away to
southward, to be answered in
a moment by a mate away to
eastward. The goats would
be cowering back into the
ruins of the town.
At last Nat had the job
done, the wheel back and only
needing to be bolted. He was
scratching around in the dust
for the nuts and washers when
a far-off sound caught his
attention. It was a faint dron-
ing, an engine sound, coming
on the evening breeze from
westward.
He cocked his eye skyward.
But the sound hadn’t the
music in it of an aero-engine.
Apparently that dawned on
him. He turned from the
truck and began to climb
straight-up out of the gully.
He reached the top out of
breath, to stand heaving and
slavering, staring across the
town at the aerodrome.
It was from Ben Larkin’s
utility that the sound came.
There it was now, running
through the ruins and the
goats, down to the road-
junction, there to turn —west-
ward, towards Lilyvale, Coen!
For a while Nat watched
the golden dust of old Ben’s
progress. Then with a sigh
he turned his gaze upon the
aerodrome, where the white
wind-sock floated gently in the
evening breeze, strangely dis-
tinct in that roseate-aureate
glowing, and likewise the cosy
cluster of whitewashed build-
ings beneath the radio-masts,
headquarters of “A.T.C.
Barragoola.”

Retrospect on Brisbane Royal —
QUEENSLAND'S RISING ACHIEVEMENTS
By “NORTHMAN”
Queensland’s tremendous
natural resources and her
rapidly accelerating progress
in land-development, stock-
raising and in agriculture were
triumphantly unfolded at this
year’s Brisbane Royal Show.
Looking back on it now
and weighing it up as a whole
it can be said that the Royal
National Association has never
given a more satisfying por-
trayal of what is being accom-
plished by primary producers
in the North. Improvements
reflected in quality-livestock
exhibits and the rising achieve-
ments of agriculturists gener-
ally were only a foretaste of
the vast capacity for develop-
ment which lies ahead in many
fields of endeavor. In fact,
overall standards at the Show
were the best ever attained
at Brisbane, the magnificence
of the exhibits leading the

Dunrossil) to observe, when
opening the Show, that the
State’s range of agricultural
products was enormous, and
made a grand contribution to
Australia’s welfare.
Beef-cattle
One of the greatest features
of the Show was a record dis-
play of stud beef-cattle. The
“ You're putting the brakes on too hard, Miss Whipper."
overall entry of 679 head was
the greatest support ever given
to this important section ; last
year’s total of 611 was the
previous best. Even more
satisfying, in most of the six
breeds paraded the judges
were impressed with improve-
ments in breed-standards.
Keynote of the quality of
a large proportion of the stud-
stock shown was a solid con-
fidence in the future of the
beef industry. This was the
feature of the section which
most impressed Australian
Meat Board chairman J. L.
Shute, who said studmasters
were obviously in touch with
current demands, and were
breeding bulls capable of pro-
ducing the type of commercial
cattle sought by home and
export markets.
Significant of solid progress
taking place in Queensland
was that leading studs in this
State held their own against
solid competition from high-
quality cattle entered from
N.S.W. and Victoria.
Poll Herefords
For the third year in a row
Poll Herefords, with 187
exhibits, provided the biggest
breed - representation. This
was only three down on the
showing here last year, when
they established a new record
for an Australian show-ring.
The judge, R. L. McEarchern,
of Strathdownie (Vic.), hailed
the breed’s showing generally
as the best lot of Poll Here-
fords he had seen in 18 years
of coming to Brisbane. The
breed, he said, had improved
even since he judged here
three years ago. Grand-
champion bull was Springfield
Crusader 3rd, brought out by
S. T. Hawkins, of Spring-
field, Finley (N.S.W.), and
described by the judge as the
most outstanding champion he
had ever judged. He said he
had bone, substance, color,
fleshing, and a terrific ability
to carry his fleshing.
Junior - champion bull,
Sandalwood Captain Mischief
2nd, was shown by the
Queensland breeders R. and
L. Fah 1, of Sandalwood,
Meandarra, who also brought
out the senior-champion Poll
Hereford cow. Grand-cham-
pion cow, Inverary Belle 9th,
came from the Queensland
breeders J. H. Anderson and
Sons, of Inverary, Yandilla.

as well as the junior-champion’;

the grand - championship
ribbon. In all, a spectacular ;
success achieved in great com-
pany, said the judge, P. j
Snow, of Quean beyan
(N.S.W.), who hailed thei
breed’s showing generally as
outstanding. He said the bulls
were the best lot he had ever
seen at Brisbane. They stood
out for constitution, confor-
mation, color and markings,
and, taken all round, were
beautifully turned-out. The l
female classes brought out i
many good-quality exhibits.;
The junior-champion bull,
Woodlands Man-o'-Iron, went
on to grand - championship
honors, hailed by the judge asa
beautifully balanced calf, even
on top and underneath.
Poll Shorthorns
The Poll Shorthorns werej
the breed’s best showing yet
at Brisbane —an increase®
numbers, and with quality of j
a high order. The judge, N-
Ryrie, of Trangie _(N.S.W ;
said the bulls exhibited soli
breed-development, and shows
plenty of scale and fleshing.

championship was Gun®

grea ter prominence of
exotic breeds, the Brahmans,
Santa Gertrudis and Drought-
masters. These cattle appeared
in greater numbers than ever
before and attracted much
wider attention, and their
quality was praised by the
judge, E. B. Joyce, of Eids-
vold (Q.), as showing good
progress.
Santa Gertrudis exhibits were
of a high standard. The cham-
pion bull, Risdon Emperor,
shown by King Ranch (Aust.)
Pty., Ltd., Risdon, Warwick
(Q.), was an outstanding exam-
ple of the breed. The judge said
he was of a type being striven
for in Australia ; if maintained
this type would make a great
contribution to the beef-cattle
industry. This October, 1957,
bull weighed 22061 b., and was
one of the heaviest exhibits on
the Showground.
Beef-cattle Sales
Stud beef-cattle brought
record prices at the Show
auctions, values reflecting
buoyant meat-market condi-
tions and confidence of cattle-
men. Altogether 291 bulls and
21 females realised an aggre-
gate of 181,350gn5., an average
of 581|gns.. a head. Top
price was 6500gn5., for the
Woodlands Stud’s senior-
champion Hereford bull,
Woodlands Panda, purchased
by the Torsdale Pastoral Co.,
Biloela (Q.). It was a record
for this breed at the Brisbane
Show, the previous record
being 6000gns. paid for
Woodlands Saxon, from the
same stud, in 1955.
Woodlands Stud’s great
string of Show successes paid-
off in the auction-ring to the
tune of 25,000gn5. for eight
of nine bulls offered —highest
amount ever received by one
exhibitor at the Brisbane
Royal. The Torsdale Pastoral
Co. put 14,300gn5. of its con-
fidence into Woodlands cattle.
Apart from paying the record
price, the company secured
Woodlands Man-o’-Iron, the
grand-champion bull, for
4000gns., and paid 3800gns.
for another bull, Woodlands
Eden, second-prize winner in
the 18-to-21 months class.
Poll Herefords averaged
590|gns. for 84 bulls and six
females, compared with an
average of 555gns. last year.
This year’s auctions established
a new record top price for a
bull of the breed, 3400gn5.,
paid for the junior-champion,
Sandalwood Captain Mischief
2nd, bought from R. and L.
Fahl, of Meandarra (Q.), by
Henry Besch, of Prospect
Vale, Rockhampton.
Poll Shorthorns sold to
1750gn5., and averaged
517|gns. (535gns. average last
year); Shorthorns, to llOOgns.
and an average of 379igns.
(371gns.); Santa Gertrudis to
2000gns., only one sold (none
sold last year); Angus, to
1300gns., and an average of
468|gns. (367jrgns. last year);
Droughtmasters, to 625gn5.,
and an average of 470gns.
(lOOOgns. last year for only
one sold); and Devons, to
725gn5., and an average of
333gns. (291gns.).
Commercial Classes
Good progress by Queens-
land producers was strongly
reflected in the Show’s com-
mercial-cattle classes. Dry
conditions caused numbers to
drop drastically on last year’s,
but this did not detract from
the major achievement of the
exhibits the directing of
attention to solid develop-
ments in commercial herds to
improve the standard of cattle
needed for the exacting
requirements of the meat trade,
at home and abroad.
To the judge, R. S. Wilson,
of Calliope, Gladstone (Q.),
the most pleasing feature was
the large proportion of young
cattle. He said he found the
best stock in the young classes.
The whole yarding, he said,
was an impressive showing of
well-bred, good-quality cattle.
They demonstrated the indus-
try could today produce the
type of beef most in demand
for the home and export
trades, provided the nutritional
level was maintained through-
out the life of cattle. He
hailed the pen of six bullocks,
suitable for the Australian
domestic trade, as the out-
standing class of the cattle-
section. From it was selected
the champion pen of bullocks
or steers. They were six Here-
fords shown by J. T. and
J. C. D. Brodie, of Chin-
chilla (Q.).
Dairy-cattle
Queensland dairymen
triumphed over an adverse
season and a hard winter by
parading before the judges a
magnificent display of cattle.
A proportion of the exhibits
in some of the breeds reflected
the difficult conditions in many
dairying districts, but most
southern judges praised the
high-quality standards main-
tained. This was especially a
feature of the popular Aus-
tralian Illawarra Shorthorns
and Jerseys, which were by far
the biggest breed-divisions.
A.
The display of A.I.S. • cattle
could not be surpassed any-
where in Australia, said the
judge, P. V. O’Keefe, of Berry
(N.S.W.), who was especially
impressed with the females,
which he described as a won-
derful lot of the right types.
The A.I.S. parades were a
signal victory for J. Phillips and
Sons, of Sunnyview, Kingaroy
(Q.). Major wins obtained by
their team included the cham-
pion cow, Yarranvale Empress
13th; the reserve champion,
Sunnyview Little Princess 30th ;
the junior-champion female,
Sunnyview Little Princess 33rd ;
reserve junior-champion female,
Sunnyview Little Princess 35th ;
and the junior-champion bull,
Sunnyview Minerva’s Royal.
The judge said the champion
cow was very typical of the
breed. She was an excellent
soft roan, with nice head and
neck, good back, and wide in
the nostrils and mouth.
Jerseys
High praise for the Jersey
breed came from the judge, C.
B. Cowan, of Theresa Creek,
Casino (N.S.W.), who said the
quality, bloom and condition
of the exhibits were splendid
and far above what he ex-
pected, considering the difficult
season. A great victory for
females was won by J. F. Lau,
of Rosallen, Goombungee (Q.),
who brought out the champion
cow, Rosallen Handsome, to
record her third successive
championship at Brisbane. A
real Jersey aristocrat, said the
judge.

Berry (N.S.W.), said the cham-
pion cow, Inverell May, shown
by B. Goddard, of Mt. Tyson
(Q.), would hold her own any-
where ; she combined the good
qualities of udder - formation
and appearance of production
which were lacking in other
exhibits of the breed.
Guernseys
The Guernseys impressed the
judge, C. C. Drury, of Taree
(N.S.W.), as being good repre-
sentatives of their breed,
although disappointing in num-
bers. A. B. Fletcher, of Cos-
sartvale, Boonah (Q.), took-off
both the championship and
reserve for females, with Cos-
sartvale Treasure and Cossart-
vale Empress, respectively. The
judge described the champion
as an outstanding dairy-cow.
Friesians
Tops in the Friesian division
were good, but tail-enders in
several classes reflected the
adverse seasonal conditions,
said the judge, J. A. Halliday,
of Wahroonga (N.S.W.). Cham-
pion cow—Freshfields Coun-
tess Bettina, exhibited by S. E.
G. MacDonald, of Freshfields,
Marburg—was described by the
judge as a typical Friesian
and an ideal dairy-cow.
Dairy-cattle Sales
Due to the adverse condi-
tions dairy-cattle values were
substantially down on last
year’s buoyant levels, and bid-
ding throughout was hesitant.
Last year’s record Show prices
for stud dairy-cattle, especially
for young bulls, stemmed from
the demand created by a wide-
spread need to build-up herds
■—following the heavy drain on
aged bulls and other stock sold
by dairymen to cash-in on
lucrative prices coming from
the North American hambur-
ger-trade. The demand con-
tinues, but not to the same
extent as a year ago. Austra-
lian Illawarra Shorthorns made
the best prices of all breeds
offered this year.
Merino-ram Sales
The Show’s Merino ram
sales were also hit by the bad
seasons, and affected as well
by the uncertain wool-market,
though a clearance of 219 rams
realised 24,000gn5., or an aver-
age of 109|gns., compared
with 108fgns. last year. Highest
price was 1900gns. for a Had-
don Rig stud ram, bought by
Mayger Bros., of Nevertire
(N.S.W.).
Liquid Ammonia
“B ro n k”: An increasing
amount of liquid agricultural
ammonia is being produced in
the U.S.A. Although it costs
more by weight than solid
plant-food it is actually the
cheapest source of nitrogen, its
nitrogen-content being 82 per
cent., compared with 45 per
cent, in urea, 33 per cent, in
ammonium-nitrate and 21 per
cent, in ammonium-sulphate.
On irrigated holdings the
ammonia is directed into the
irrigation - channels ; elsewhere
it is injected into the ground,
usually by means of a tank
mounted on a wheeled steel
frame, from which a number
of curved metal shanks with
long blades cut into the soil.
Down shanks behind the blades
thin tubes from the tank carry
the fertiliser into the earth to
a depth of from 6in. to Bin.
The blades are so designed that
the soil, cut into narrow
trenches, falls back and im-
prisons the ammonia. In the
ground the liquid becomes a
gas and quickly permeates the
soil.
The liquid preparation saves
labor and works much quicker
than fertilisers which need rain
or applied water to become
effective. No opening, lifting
and emptying of heavy bags is
needed, while transport is easy
and transfer from tank to tank
has the advantage of being
done at the point where fertilis-
ing is to begin.
It is estimated that one man
with a tractor and applicator
can do the same amount of
fertilising with agricultural
ammonia as four men with two
tractors and spreaders could
with solid fertiliser.
About Bloat
“Vee”: In the middle of a
drought there’s nothing more
frustrating than to have suc-
culent fodder, and yet find
your cattle dying of bloat,
Apparently the incidence of
fatal bloat in Australia is only
2\ per cent., but remembering
the number of beasts run that
is not inconsiderable. With
milking-herds, loss of produc-
tion caused by moderate bloat
is a serious economic factor,
I’ve heard all the remedies
and warnings on bloat—from
a hose down the beast’s throat
and tar on its nose to a bit
in its mouth and massage on
its left flank. People will tell
you not to put cows on pas-
ture when it is wet, or when
the wind blows from the east,
or when they are hungry,
That’s all very well in theory,

REPORT FROM CROHAMHURST
(25/8/’60)
Queensland can expect light rains, generally below
normal, in September, with better falls along part of the
coast and on the central highlands. Rainfall will probably
be poor in October, although there should be good rains
in much of the State during November.
N.S.W. may have only light rains, generally below
normal, in September, although better falls are likely on
part of the Southern Tablelands, South-west Slopes and
Riverina. The coastal districts and the tablelands should
have moderate rains in October, and general rains should
follow in November.
There should he good rains in Victoria during Sep-
tember, with best falls in the north-eastern and west-coastal
districts. Light to moderate rains are likely in East Gipps-
land. Rainfall may vary from light to moderate during
October and November.
The agricultural areas and west-coast districts of South
Australia should have good rains in September, with light
falls in the interior. The agricultural areas should have
light to moderate patchy rains during October and
November.
About the Gascoyne and in the s.-w. agricultural areas
of Western Australia there should be good rains in Sep-
tember, with lighter falls in the south-eastern districts.
Rainfall elsewhere in the State is likely to be poor.

n also proliferate
new crowns from their roofs.
In addition to the strong tap-
root, a large number of roots
radiate laterally and can
develop crowns at soil-depths
from 4in. to 24in. Crowns may
extend up to 9ft. from the
original centre after three years’
growth. One plant may be
capable of producing over 300
new crowns, which are capable
of existing independently if the
parent or connecting root-stock
is severed or dies.
Varieties of lucerne devel-
oped in Canada and the U.S.A.
are poorly adapted to condi-
tions in southern parts of Aus-
tralia and of no value at all in
the north. Dormant in the
winter, these varieties produce
little fodder and soon die out,
because they do not develop
their creeping-rooted character
in Australian conditions.
A trial conducted at the
C.5.1.R.0. laboratory at Lawes
(Q.) showed that Hunter River
lucerne was 70 times more
productive than the original
Canadian Rambler variety over
a period of three years. In a
breeding-programme, started in
1956, selected plants of Ram-
bler stock were crossed with
Hunter River. Hybrids from
this cross have been selected
and intercrossed, with results
that have so far been promis-
ing. There seems no doubt
that a creeping-rooted variety
suitable to Australian con-
ditions will be developed,
though this may take some
years’ further work.
Too Msidi of a
Good Thing
“B-herd”: Since last Sep-
tember the trees have been
giving out more nectar than
even the bees and their herds
can gather. The price—for the
best honey that had been
through the extractor for 10
years!—tumbled from 14d. to
12d. overnight, then to lOd.
It’s common knowledge, of
course, that the cost of pro-
ducing a pound of good honey
is about Is. Imagine, then,
the thoughts of a bee-herder,
astride a five-ton truck which
is creaking and groaning under
the weight of a couple of
hundred tins of yellow-box,
racing to Sydney Town and
running in and out of the
shops There trying to raise an
eightpenny bid!
Some of the big men in the
game stuck to a producers’
selling - organisation and
attempted to hold their top
price of 16d. But in the face
of other honey being peddled
at Bd., the organisation kept
its doors open mainly for
fresh air.
The honey-flow continued
through the summer and into
late autumn, when even the
eightpenny market became
glutted. Around June some
in the industry approached
the N.S.W. Government for
board - control. Before this
could be made law more than
50 per cent, of producers had
to vote in its favor, and, with
such examples as the Egg
Board and the Wheat Board
publicised in the meantime,
when it came to the voting at
the end of June the decision
was: No board for the bee-
herds.
The position reached since
then is that honey-sales have
never been worse, and in
N.S.W., at any rate, there’s a
sturdy group of independent
men fighting for the right to
sell their product—and an
excellent product at that —for
half what it’s worth.
The present prolonged glut
will right itself eventually—
the trees will see to that. But
meanwhile poor export-prices
(7d. a pound), indifferent
local sales, and a glut of honey
all over the country make
things look grim for very
many bee-herders.
Two Apple Pests
“Lyra”: It’s disquieting to
learn that Australian apples
and pears had been rejected by
Sweden and Western Germany
because of San Jose scale and
infection by woolly-aphid.
San Jos6 scale attacks trunk,
branches, leaves and fruit of
deciduous trees, and usually
shows its presence by disr
coloration on the leaves and
fruit. The pests, which Suck
the sap, are most destructive
scale-insects for all summer-
fruit trees.
Control by spraying with
red-oil during the winter at the
strength of lgal. oil to 20gal.
water. Lime-sulphur, sprayed
at the rate of lgal. to lOgal.
water during the dormant
period, is also satisfactory.
Tar-distillate wash is not quite
as effective as the other two
sprays, but gives good control
of both the green-peach and
black-peach aphids. It should
be used at the same rate as on
stone-fruit trees, but must be
applied before buds begin to
swell.
For the woolly apple-aphid—
which, like San Jose scale, feeds
on the sap of the host-tree,
gathering in colonies on roots
and branches and producing
gall-like malformations nico-
tine - sulphate, sprayed under
high-pressure, gives a reason-
able degree of control, provided
that spraying—it is rather
costly—is repeated at frequent
intervals during the summer.
Introduction of a wasp-para-
site which breeds on the aphids,
has given a degree of biological
control in many districts. This
insect checks infestation for
most of the year, but two appli-
cations of nicotine sulphate—
one in the spring and the other
in late autumn —will do a lot
to help it.

H. A. Lindsay’s correction on the
last of the Tasmanian aborigines:
“Truganina was not the last of the
Tasmanian aborigines. At some
time between 1810 and 1819 four
convicts escaped from Tasmania in
a stolen whaleboat. They took
with them four Tasmanian abo-
riginal girls: Pussy, Bumblefoot,
Betty and Sukey. After a voyage
of great hardship they reached
lsland (S.A.), where there
was already a little community
of other escaped convicts, seamen
who had deserted from whaling
ships and mainland aboriginal
women. The South Australian
census of 1866 shows that these
‘four aboriginal women, natives of
Van Diemen’s Land,’ were then
still alive. Two of them were still
living in 1876, when Truganina
died, and S’lkey did not die until
1888.”
Information Sought
How did the Congo originally
become a Belgian colony ?
The discoveries of- Livingstone
and other explorers in the middle
of the 19 th century stimulated
interest in Central Africa. In
1876 King Leopold II convened a
conference which resulted in the
creation of the International Asso-
ciation for the Exploration and
Civilisation of Africa, which was
more interested in East Africa until
Stanley’s journey along the Congo
River. Leopold became interested
in the development of the Congo
basin, and formed a separate com-
mittee of the International Associa-
tion which came to be known as
the International Association of
the Congo. The Berlin conference
of 1884-85 gave recognition to this
body as a sovereign State. In
1885 the Belgian Chamber author-
ised Leopold as chief of State and
later in the same year the king
declared the “perpetual neutrality
of the Independent State of the
Congo” and set out the boundaries
the State claimed. Upon charges
of the maladministration of the
State the Belgian Parliament began
to prepare to take-over the Congo
as a Belgian possession, and in
August, 1908, adopted a treaty of
cession and a law setting out the
principles on which the new colony
should be governed. In November
the Congo Free State ceased to
exist and the Belgian Government
assumed authority.

Amendments to the age-pension
scheme as contained in this year’s
Budget ?
Under the proposed new means-
test the income and property tests
will be merged in determining a
person’s pension entitlement. The
maximum annual pension will be
reduced by the amount by which
the pensioner’s “means as assessed”
exceed £lB2. The “means as
assessed,” except in the case of a
class “A” widow’s pensioner,
represent the pensioner’s income
plus one-tenth of the value of his
property in excess of £2OO.
In the case of a class “A”
widow’s pensioner, the complete
exemption of property will remain
where its value does not exceed
£2250. Where the value exceeds
that amount, a property component
of £1 for each complete £lO of
the value of the property in excess
of £lOOO will b'e added to income
to comprise the “means as
assessed.”
The computation of income and
property for pension purposes will
continue as at present, certain
income and the value of permanent
home, furniture and personal
effects, between £2OO and £2250,
being disregarded. The proposed
alterations are not expected to come
into force until about next March.
Brief Answers
D.F.: Two kinds of fallacious
argument come under this head,
the first saying that the properties
of a whole must be properties of
each of its parts, the second that
the properties of a group of wholes
are properties of each whole. The
classic example of this kind of
fallacy is the following: the race
is disappearing; John is a
of the race; therefore John is
disappearing... .P.T.: Amy John-
son’s first and most famous feat
was in 1930, when she flew from
England to Australia in 19 days,
being the first woman to accom-
plish the flight alone... .R.W.:
The Australian Encyclopedia sug-
gests that the native companion
got its name from its habit of
associating in flocks to a great
extent, the “native” being tacked-
on by the early colonists according
to the custom of the period—as
was done with so many plants.
... .C.D.: An Executive Council
exists in each Dominion of the
British Commonwealth and in
States, being a Parliamentary insti-
tution based on the British Queen
in Council, comprising the Queen’s
representative as president and the
Ministry, its function being to advise
the (Queen’s representative) in the
Government of the (Commonwealth,
Dominion, State). The term
Leader of the Government in the
House of Representatives arose,
following the British Parliament,
from the need for a “House
manager,” and for a leader to be
present at times when the Prime
Minister was absent from the
House... .W.8.R.: The address is
Golden Casket, Government Build-
ings, Edward and Ann Streets,
Brisbane... .T.H.: Edgar Wallace,
novelist, journalist, dramatic author
and manager, died at the age of
56 (1932). He was heavily in debt
when he died, though his estate
later paid his creditors in full.

Loan Council and the State
Treasury decide,, it is em-
powered to raise its own loans,
but that is only part of the
story. A loan-allocation is one
thing; raising the money on
a market thick with other
enticements is quite another
story, and this was Goodsell’s
problem.
He set out on an almost
heroic one-man public-
relations campaign to convince
the city’s business and indus-
trial leaders that their future
depended largely on the
development of essential ser-
vices, such as water and
sewerage. There can’t be
many men in the top bracket
today who have not lunched
with him, or visited Warra-
gamba or other board works,
and heard his quick, husky
voice explaining what the
board is doing, and what it
must do.
In his time as president the
board has poured £68,000,000
into, new works.
TIfHiLE trying to teach,
Goodsell has learnt
something extra himself.
He left the Treasury rich
in experience of government
and government service. His
almost ceaseless campaigning
on behalf of the board among
business and industrial leaders
has given him a keen insight
into their problems. He will
leave the board as convinced
as any man could be —and
trying to convince others —
that the welfare of the State
lies in the closest co-operation
between Government and
private enterprise.
He will also leave the board
with a record of vigorous
administration. In his time
as president he has seen the
city’s storage-capacity increase
fivefold to 576,000-million
gallons, a greater storage per
head than ever before and
probably the greatest in any
city in the world. He has seen
the rate of main-laying
increase by more than 50 per
cent., and more than 1700
miles of sewers and water-
mains added to the system —■
now totalling more than
10,500 miles.
In this last year, after see-
ing all sewerage main-laying
records broken, he has
launched the board on the
biggest construction-pro-
gramme it has ever under-
taken.
As chairman of the State
Public Service Board, he will
take-over the top public ser-
vice job from the old chief
under whose guidance and
encouragement he reorganised
half the Government depart-
ments in N. S. Wales. He
will also be close to another
old friend, Premier Bob
Heffron, with whom he has
worked, off and on, through-
out his career, and whom he
regards as a shrewd and
capable leader.
It’s been a long ride and
a good one for th.e clerk on
horseback from the rain-
forests of the South Coast.

Another Gold Label
Winner
For anyone aiming to
make a collection of the
world’s best classical orchestral
music, with quality not sacri-
ficed despite the modest price,
Philips’s series of Gold Label
disks is a most valuable source
to tap. There is especially good
value in the latest release
Brahms Symphony No. 2 (GL
16), for on the reverse is the
same composer’s Variations on
a Theme of Haydn, the most
splendid work of its kind ex-
tant, richly melodious, graceful
music based on the old St.
Anthony Chorale. The sym-
phony is the sunniest of his
four, the lovely adagio the
only serious note struck in a
work which is comparable to
Beethoven’s “Pastoral.” Both
these Brahms works are played
ebulliently by the Vienna Sym-
phony Orchestra under Wolf-
gang Sawallish.

Transallantic
Nowadays New York’s Tin
Pan Alley successes are soon
heard on hit-parades all over
the world. But the traffic isn’t
all one way ; at the same time
a fairly steady flow of songs
from Britain, France, Germany
and Italy finds its way across
the Atlantic to be played by
U.S. dance-bands and sung by
U.S. singers. European Hits in
America (HAA 7590), a
Decca recording, features a
dozen modern German, French
and Italian songs, presented as
dance - numbers by Richard
Wolfe and his band. Most of
them have been heard before,
but the collection is well chosen
and includes “Guaglione,”
“Marina,” “Ciao, Ciao Bam-

Stravinsky Ballet
It is not surprising that after
Stravinsky composed his ballet
Petrouchka (now compassed on
an R.C.A. disk, L 16245) he
was so regarded as a prophet
of the future - music by the
other young men who con-
sidered that formalism and
tradition in art was choking
them that one of them paraded
a banner through the streets
in Rome proclaiming “Down
with Wagner! ” Long Live
Stravinsky! ” ironical, con-
sidering that in his own day
the German was an arch-rebel
against the classico-romantic-
ism as expounded by Brahms.
And certainly in this ballet
Strav. did kick-over the traces
with gusto. The music, sinewy
and often atonal, quivers
with vital energy and dramatic
urgency—music eminently
suited as corollary to fast-
moving choreographic patterns
on the stage and which illus-
trates vividly the tragedy and
cruelty and the grisly humor
attending the tyranny rife in
the Russia of an older despot-
ism. For those who like
elegance in music, no ; but for
the balletomane who can take
strong evocations this sym-
phonic suite is a distinct yes,
as here adapted from the
ballet and played with empha-
sis on its pictorial qualities by
Pierre Monteux, with the Bos-
ton Symphony.

known women.
West Australian authoress Helen
Wilson has just had published her third
novel, “Where the Wind’s Feet Shine,”
and a fourth, “If Golde Rust...” has
been accepted. In addition, her first novel
will soon be brought out as a paper-
back. Born in Tasmania, Mrs. Wilson
is a Bachelor of Arts and was the first
woman to be awarded a Blue at the
University of Western Australia, her
sport being hockey. She is also adept at
tennis and golf. She has two sons and
a daughter, all university-graduates, one
a doctor doing post-graduate medicine
in the U.S.; another is with the Austra-
lian diplomatic service in Cairo; and
her daughter, Mrs. William Hamersley,
of Hamersley Siding, York, W.A., is,
like her mother, a B.A. A prolific writer,
especially since the close of World War
II, Mrs. Wilson has had published, in
addition to her novels, nearly 100 short
stories and has written innumerable
scripts for the A.B.C.
The most colorful group of ushers
and usherettes to date were on duty at
the Diamond Jubilee Concert of the
Royal Philharmonic Society at the Town
Hall on Thursday night. They wore
national-costumes of many lands, em-
broidered red tulips on the Dutch aprons,
butterfly-sleeves on the Philippine cos-
tume (Jessis Umayam, daughter of the
Consul-General, wore a golden variety
of these), kimonos for slim Japanese
figures and cheong-sams for elegant
Chinese. Lady Woodward was welcomed
by Mrs. Walter Bunning, president of
the social-committee which organised the
concert in aid of Talking Books for the
Blind, and by Mr. Roland Foster, presi-
dent of the Philharmonic Society. One
of the highlights of the evening was the
arrival in a 1912 white Rolls-Royce of
David Gray (from the “My Fair Lady”
company) in top-hat, opera-coat, etc.,
accompanied by two glamorous girls,
Anne Martin and Lyndal Moor.
Sir Kenneth Street kept his listeners
bubbling with laughter when he spoke
at the 60th annual meeting of the Sydney
District Nursing Association during the
week, one of his references being to
the old Arabian custom when every
hospital had a troupe of dancing-girls
who also did duty as nurses. Sir Kenneth
remarked that they must have had an
enormously recuperative effect on some
elderly patients! The association, started
61 years ago to take care of people in
their own homes, began with one nurse
who went on foot around Sydney; it
now has 42 nurses whose district ranges
from Palm Beach to Sutherland, Fair-
field, Hornsby, and was this year ex-
tended to Glenbrook on the Blue Moun-
tains. Mr. R. C. Smith, who presided
at the meeting, said that more money
was needed for the work, which should
appeal as a direct and rewarding cause.

Two pretty girls from overseas,
Audrey White (London) and Mari
Monsees (New York) are here to plead
the cause of cotton as a textile, and ways
to make it up. They’re advising on the
subject at David Jones’ this week.
Audrey, a tall brunette, is fashion-editor
of an English woman’s magazine.
Mari Monsees, also a tall brunette,
expressed a keen desire to go swimming
while in Sydney and probably got a
chance during the weekend. Actually,
though the sun is hot, the water is very
chilly at this time of the year. A wool
swimsuit would solve the problem (this is
the Wool Bureau’s opinion), or a brisk
rub-down with a terry-towelling beach-
towel (this is the cotton-pickers’ pick).
You can take your own pick. Me, I
won’t be swimming till November.

Noted that there is a fashion overseas
to decorate your rooms to match your
hair. Wouldn’t it be cheaper to dye
your hair to match your rooms?

Another First to the Black and White
Committee is the pre-opening inspection
and cocktail-party to be held at the
Carlton-Rex Hotel on Monday, Sep-
tember 26. This is the completely re-
modelled former Carlton in Castlereagh
Street. The party-goers are to be taken
from basement to attic of the hotel to
see the improvements, though those who
wish to linger in the lounge may doubtless
do so. The tickets are £2-10s. each, all
proceeds going to the Royal Blind
Society.

The early-morning fashion-parade (8.15
is the time) which the Wool Bureau is
staging at Flemington shortly, certainly
shows enterprise. It is for owners,
trainers, jockeys and their wives, who
will be too busy at the Centenary Mel-
bourne Cup Carnival to watch the clothes.
However, it seems more loyal to the
nation and the wool industry than to
Melbourne to predict “True to form, Mel-
bourne will turn on typical November
weather. And for that, the seasoned race-
goer will know what to wear—wool!”


last stanzas because “The intervening
verses dare not be quoted”; the
macabre and powerful scenes when the
three convict murderers kill their three
less-evil mates so that they can steal
their rations for the planned escape;
the improbability of the killing so early
in the plot, which forces the murderers
not only to conceal the crime in their
hole down the coalmine for the next
eight days or more but also to do all
the dead men’s work when their own is
supposed to be already beyond their
capacities; the final impression that
Warung, a lover of the dark and the
bizarre, has contrived all this merely
so that he can present his macabre
scenes of the dead men propped'-up with
candles in their hands to be shown
present at roll-call.
But then we come to the extra-
ordinary story called “Secret Society of
the Ring”: sustained to impressive
length; plausible in at least one aspect
of its history, in that Captain Macono-
chie was in fact a kindly officer who
established little farms for the convicts
on Norfolk Island; fascinating if not
fully believable in its account of the
machinations and ritual of “The Ring”
(whose ceremonies are peculiarly like
the Black Mass); and, whether or not
you can believe that the secret-society
would execute a member merely for
having said he would be the com-
mandant’s “true man” (not for betray-
ing the society), quite haunting when
the man is condemned and most dra-
matic —granted the situation —when his
friend, at last bringing himself to
undertake the execution as “The
Ring” has ordered him to, goes off into
the night with his “I be off —— t’
do ut, Peake!” Here, at any rate, drama
or melodrama, Warung wrote an un-
forgettable story.
Taking advantage of Warung’s own
condemnation of the officers on Norfolk
Island in the words of the convict John-
son to Captain Maconochie—“The
System finds orl its orf’cers men, and
leaves ’em all brutes! Orl o’ we don’t
get ’ardened, but there ain’t one o’ yer
wot doesn’t”—the unsigned introduc-
tion to this selection adds, “The con-
victs came in overwhelming propor-
tion from what in those days were
termed the ‘lower orders’ and between
them and the officers existed a bitter
and ceaseless conflict.... Such were
Lieutenant Darrell, Commandant
Scragge and John Price. The ordinary
garrison soldiers, however, are not por-
trayed as persecutors and often reveal
an affinity with the convicts when
moved by pity to assist them.” But
surely there were brutes—and men of
goodwill—among all three classes, con-
victs, officers and soldiers. James Back-
house, the Quaker, who may be taken as
a fairly reliable witness, is, in fact, as
critical of the soldiers as he is of their
officers. What Price Warung really
needs, especially as so much of his
appeal depends on his air of authenti-
city, is a more scholarly edition show-
ing, where possible, how much is fact
and how much is fiction.

White Men and Brown
In the Company of Man (Harper) is
a set of twenty “profiles” of people of
many races ranging from Brazil to
New Guinea, edited by Joseph B.
Casagrande.
Though it is written by trained
anthropologists, it is likely to be some-
what misleading. The point is, if you
are going to take full and detailed
notes of the life of an aboriginal who
admits to having committed four
murders and is suspected of having
done eleven, you can hardly expect
to have a very happy story. And
similarly if you tell the story of a New
Guinea native who, as his own words
attest, got off to a very bad start: “My
mother was about to kill me in the
birth-house by the water when Ooti
came there and took me. Tabike
wanted to kill me because she had too
many children already. Tabike did not
want to give me away, and she already
had her foot on my neck to shut off
my wind.”

THE LANGUAGE OF
FOREIGNERS
Two people who are foreigners
May meet beneath the sun
And find, whatever they are saying,
The light a common tongue.
Their eyes, delicate travellers,
Knock no customs down,
Declaring all they have for giving
But smuggling half a town.
Whatever visas, dates of entry,
There are no forms to fill,
No blackened village mars the breast
And shoulder of their hill.
They meet cleanly as the process
Of grasping a thing alive,
The squeaking stems of daffodils,
A radish split red to white.
Their language is a way of learning,
The best, being made with lips
Whose language is a way of loving.
The tongue can make its slips.
Two people who are foreigners
Have no word wars to win,
And they, while the natives squabble,
dance
On the neutral grass of spring.

skirmish was the turning-point in Eng-
land’s relations with Spain and the start
of English naval tactics.
Survivors of this expedition straggled
home over many years, each with his
own tale of adventure. Many suffered
under the Inquisition—some being sent
to the stake, others to the galleys. One
band of English seamen claimed to
have walked the length of North
America before they found a ship to
take them home.
The book, carefully written and
well illustrated, includes its own select
bibliography.
Another very different adventure-
story from the same publisher is
Zahra Freeth’s Run Softly Demerara,
a record of four years spent recently
in a bauxite-mining town 50 miles up
the Demerara River in British Guiana.
It shows the results of European
influence on the Caribbean and South
America and might be read as a sort
of corollary to Hawkins’s less-inhibited
ventures.
A pedestrian book, about what may
be described as a fairly dull country, it
has a good chapter about birds, beasts
and butterflies and is interesting on the
problems of the “Amerindians,” de-
prived by civilisation of the medicine-
men on whom they relied for both
religion and medicine, and too seldom
offered anything in replacement.
Penguins
Atmosphere being a large part of
their power, few of Eugene O’Neill’s
plays read very well, and the three early
ones Penguins have chosen for the first
O’Neill volume of their admirable
drama series are no exceptions. One of
them, however, “Desire Under the
Elms,” is among his best —the nearest
he came to a pure tragic line. The
others—“Anna Christie” and “The
Emperor Jones” — are still worth
arguing about; and all three, with their
refrains and pounding idiom, seem
more than ever to be awaiting the
hand of an American Verdi.
The object of James Thurber and
E. B. White’s satire in Is Sex Neces-
sary?—i.e., the work of “sexology”—
is just as much, if not more, worth a
send-up now as it was when the book
first came out (1929). Yet, whether
because the authors’ comic styles are
not entirely at ease together or, more
likely, because their method has since
been imitated so often, it isn’t as funny
now as it might once have been. Still,
it is worth having for its occasional
passages of recognisably pure Thurber;
for the almost lyrical craziness of the
question-and-answer section at the
back; and, most of all, for the sheer
distinction of its prose.
Some other new Penguins and Peli-
cans are Five (five short novels) by
Doris Lessing, The Angel in the Corner
by Monica Dickens, Selected Short
Stories by William Sansom, The
Origins of Love and Hate by lan D.
Suttle, and Understanding Weather by

Reviewed Briefly
Mother of the Magnificent: Mary
Bosanquet (Faber). Biography of
Lucrezia Tomabuoni, the mother of
Lorenzo the Magnificent. Miss Bosan-
quet describes it as “a work of imagina-
tion rather than of scholarship”; which
means that it falls midway between
biography and historical fiction. That
is an uncomfortable position for any
book; but it sits there pleasantly and
informatively enough. For “readers of
all ages.”
* * * *
As For Italy: Jean-Francois Revel
(Weidenfeld and Nicolson). Translated
from the French by Anthony Rhodes,
this is a debunking of not only the
tourist’s Italy but the whole idea of
Italy as a country artistically alive:
“The Italians are the only people I
know who are utterly and totally
materialistic, without distinction of
class or profession.” The intellectuals,
refusing to criticise paintings in detail,
have no genuine taste in art; and if
their films —unlike painting and litera-
ture—do exist, they are “boring, turgid
and mechanical.” The mass of the
people are interested only in television
and football-pools. Revel is wrong and
right, of course, as is everyone who
attempts to generalise about any
nation; but at least it is refreshing to
see Italy getting it in the neck for a
change from America, Australia or
France.
* * * *
The Foxes of the Desert: Paul Card!
(Macdonald). History of the Afrika
Korps in the Western Desert and
Tunisia during War 11, written by a
German journalist who served in the
Nazi intelligence-service. Superficially
objective, the book produces by impli-
cation and in argument all the stock
German excuses for the plain fact of
their defeat in the field: the British,
Australians and Enzedders were lions
led by asses; the German generals
weren’t outwitted; it was Hitler’s crazy
decisions that led to German disaster.
There is much hero-worship of
Rommel.
