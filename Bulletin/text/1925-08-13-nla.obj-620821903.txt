The Red Pa ge
The Naked Barbarian
When the Greeks called a person a bar-
barian they only meant that he spoke their
language badly. He was a stammerer; and
when the language test became acute, after
the great literary flowering of Athens, to be
a stammerer was about as bad as to be a
scoundrel. The Romans carried on the idea
after their conquest of the Greeks, but with
curious modifications. Nothing in the Hel-
lenised part of the world was barbarian,
though much of it was .barbaric in our
modern sense, but the peoples of the North,
who represented the last additions to the
empire, were still lumped together under that
term. The result has been to give readers
of history a curiously false impression. It is
when we get down to hard facts —facts that
are not dependent upon the biased opinions
of Latin writers of a time when it was neces-
sary to justify the slaughters committed by
the legions in unoffending territories—that we
discover how far those writers have misled
us. Thus the travelling vehicles which were
used along the roads of the empire were im-
portations from the barbarian lands. The
reda, a four-wheeler, came from Gaul; so did
the pilentum, which carried the servants aud
smaller baggage; the lighter essedum was
almost certainly Gaulish, and the covvnnus
—-at first with two wheels and afterwards
with four —was the identical British article
which shook the morale of the legions on the
first clash with the people who are described
by writers as late as Hallam as “naked sav-
ages.” Apparently the only chariot which
Roman civilisation could evolve before bar-
barian skill came to the rescue was the coal-
shovel affair from which it was so easy to
fall out at the rear. But the Romans were
tremendous makers of roads and are sup-
posed to have taught this art to the con-
quered peoples, who presumably built fine
carriages before the conquest to run over
logs and boulders, while the Romans had
smooth paved highways to carry the pre-
viously mentioned coql-shovel.
Here again a closer examination throws
doubt on the accepted theory. Turning to
Merivale, a writer particularly careful of his
facts, we find that British roads earlier than
the Roman occupation ran from “Rich-
borough and Dover to Seaton and Bran-
caster, to the Severn, the Dee and the North-
ern Ouse, and it was through Londinium that
they all took their course.” Anybody who
will look at a map and consider what those
roads mean _ will be rather struck by the
extent of this barbarian road-making. The
road from Richborough to the Dee is, in fact,
the famous Watling-street, which has been
often spoken of as the Romans’ greatest
engineering work in Britain. On the face of
it, it looks as if those long straight roads
were the original highways for which the
carriages the Romans borrowed were origin-
ally built, and that there were some barbarian
engineers about at a much earlier date. Then
there is the little matter of London Bridge.
Archaeologists are now divided into two
camps, one claiming that it is of very early
Roman construction and the other bringing
strong evidence to show that it is pre-Roman.
As the pre-Roman roads all met in London,
it seems highly probable that this was the
work of barbarian experts also. “Naked
savages” in a cold climate who built carri-
ages, roads and bridges seem a little hard to
accept.
But archaeological investigation shows an
even stranger thing. The art of enamelling
on gold and silver is still among the world’s
best achievements. Greece and Rome could
not do it, but Gaul could; and it is shown
that, the centre of the industry was not even
in Gaul, but farther north in Britain. So
it seems that Caesar's painted savages, who
stayed naked up to the time of Hallam,
stepped down from their carriages to visit
the workshops of the skilled craftsmen who
had a lot-to teach to all ancient civilisation.
Rather astonishing barbarians these! The
Caesarian narrative that tells of the Gaulish
women pleading with the chiefs to save their
town because of its beauty reveals yet an-
other aspect of barbarism; and a still more
surprising one is shown by the adoption in
the middle of the third century—when Rome
was up against some real warfare of a deadly
and doubtful sort—of the long Gaulish sword.
Nor must the greatest of all the borrowings
of ancient civilisation from the barbarians
be forgotten. It was from the Gauls that
Rome got her trousers. Tailoring was not
a craft in early Greece or Rome. The b'are-
limbed civilised masters of the world twisted
themselves into yards of draping, mostly
woven in one piece, but the barbarian was
measured for his suit.
Looked at fairly, it would seem that north-
ern barbarism was pretty much a Dago
myth. Even the Germans were probably not
nearly the wild people they are represented
as being. We can gather a fair idea of what
the earliest Saxons were like; and the
earliest Franks were probably much the same
until corrupted by easy victory. But a pre-
Roman Britain, where, according to Caesar,
the houses were very numerous, which had
once been known to dwellers by the Medi-
terranean as the Island of Honey—honey
being a most important article of ancient
trade —where the biggest river was bridged
near its estuary, where fine carriages ran
on long straight roads, where fine skilled
trades were practised, where tin was mined
and pearl-fisheries were conducted, is not
quite the Britain which Latin writers con-
sidered as wisely redeemed from savagery by
organised bloodshed. After all the lapse of
years there is something to be said for Cas-
sivellaunus. It is just possible that he de-
fended the last remnant of a better world
than Julius ever knew.
D. M. W.
Concerning Stage Production
A vast amount of nonsense has been
written about stage production, which is
assumed to be more esoteric than any other
art. a dark mystery whose secrets are known
only to a few high priests. A great pro-
ducer is an important artist, more important
than any individual actor, just as an orches-
tral conductor is. or should be. more im-
portant than any of his first violins. But
the average so-called “producer” is not an
artist at all. The effects he achieves are
usually false, and the wonderful magic powers
over which he alone has control turn out
to be merely stage tricks.
It is surprising how many people lose
their critical faculty at a stage production
and are not disturbed at effects they
would not tolerate for a moment in a book.
They unconsciously lower their standard,
illustrating the old adage that when people
go into a theatre they leave their intellects,
with their umbrellas, in the cloak-room.
Take any scene —say one between a husband
and wife —and consider how it is rendered
on the stage. The husband stands on the
right, the wife on the left. They begin their
dialogue in that position, but after about a
minute they cross, for no reason except to
change their position. The wife is now right,
the husband left. After another minute it is
time for another cross. In a five-minutes
scene this duet becomes as exciting as a
game of hide and seek. A producer insists
on such crosses, which he considers necessary
to the “action,” though obviously they are
absurd. His one aim is “business.” People
must always be moving about and doing
something, usually the wrong thing. A
magazine left on the drawing-room table is
a useful device. When any character is
not in the immediate dialogue lie can always
take up the magazine. Even Du Maurier,
who is an exceptionally fine actor, was
guilty of this, though in a similar position
in real life he would not have shown such
bad manners.
The great producers, such men as Stanis-
lavsky, of the Moscow Art Theatre; Antoine,
of the Theatre Libre; W. B. Yeats, of the
Abbey Theatre; John Drinkwater, of the
Birmingham Repertory Theatre ; the directors
of the Theatre Guild in America; Bernard
Shaw and Granville Barker and others who
have taken part in the reformation of modern
drama will have nothing to do with these
tawdry devices and out-worn conventions.
Though they belong to different schools, and
have diverse artistic aims, they all agree
that there are no hidden mysteries about
a stage production, no tricks of the trade.
On this point Bernard Shaw is a helpful
guide. The beginning and end of the busi-
ness, he states simply, is the art of making
an audience believe that real things are
happening to real people. “Real things
happening to real people,” that is all. But
that is the last thing' the average actor
or producer ever thinks . about. Shaw has
had 40 years’ experience of all kinds of
players, professional and amateur, good,
bad and indifferent, and, what will come as
a sm-prise to many theatregoers, he has
acquired no great respect for the professional
star. The actor, male or female, he says,
wants the audience to believe that it is
witnessing a magnificent display of acting
by a great artist. “T'o your star actor
the play does not exist except as a mounting
block. That is why comparatively humble
actors, who do not dare to think they can
succeed apart from the x >lay, often give
much better representations than star casts.”
Few people will believe this. They have the
fixed idea that the worst professional com-
pany is superior to the best amateur. But
apart from melodrama and crude farce,
which depend on a number of mechanical
tricks, the average professional company is
far less likely to give a good performance
of a real play than a group of players who
have a more artistic understanding of it.
The very worst performance of a Shaw play
on record, I should think, was given in Mel-
bourne by a well-seasoned professional com-
pany. This play, so utterly different from
anything they had been accustomed to, proved
quite beyond their intellectual range, and
every theatrical effect they contrived to
achieve happened to be hopelessly wrong.
No band of university students, who usually
have sufficient culture to know what a play
is about, would have made such a hash of it.
Granville Barker compares the flashy his-
trionic effects in the ordinary type of play
with the cheap fiction which appears and
disappears month by month in certain maga-
zines. Because people have spent years on
this sort of stuff, which has no possible
relationship to life or literature, -their much
vaunted “experience” may be a hindrance
rather than a help to a sound interpretation
of a genuine dramatic work. That is why
any theatre that ultimately becomes dis-
tinctive has to start at the beginning and
develop a method of its own. The success
of the Dublin Abbey Theatre, says Shaw,
was due to the fact that when it began
none of the company was worth twopence
a week for ordinary fashionable purposes,
though some of them can now hold a London
audience in the hollow of their hands.
The Moscow Art Theatre had as humble
a beginning as the Dublin and Birmingham
theatres. It owes its success to Tohekhov,
who abolished at one fell swoop all the petty
little tricks so beloved of ‘ordinary producers,
and to Stanislavsky, the director, whose aim
was to turn acting into life, or, as it has
been better put, to bring life on to the stage.
But this is not so simple a task as it appears,
and it has taken years of serious work for
the company to reach its present supreme
position. Stanislavsky’s method is not likely
to make many converts, for it demands high
intelligence and self-sacrifice on the part of
the company. He never begins a rehearsal
till all the members of the company have been
steeped in the history and manners and
psychology of the time and country in which
the play is set. It is a slow process. The
actors feel that they have not begun till
every one of them has become lost in the
role he plays, and till they all in a body
have crossed that indefinable line between un-
real acting and real life history. Instead of
expressing his “personality,” each actor be-
comes for the time being the character in
the play.
It is said that Gorki introduced the actors
to the originals of the people in his play
“The Lower Depths; or Night’s Lodging.”

They haunted the restaurants in back streets
and studied every feature of the strange
characters, till they were able to recreate
them on the stage. This method will prob-
ably be regarded in some quarters as bad
art; but why should not an actor, like
a painter, have constant recourse to his
models?
LOUIS ESSON.
Mysterious Japan
Mysterious Japan, by Julian Street (Heine-
niann, London), is well worth perusing.
Street assures us that “mysterious” _is a
misnomer, as a kind of veiled simplicity is
the keynote to the Japanese character, but
lie certainly leaves the impression on the pre-
sent writer’s mind that the mystery is there
all the time. A land that wills to be ultra-
modern but is yet antique to the toetips;
a land that despises and yet apes the Occi-
dent; a land concerning which Lafcadio
Hearn wrote that after spending half a life-
time there he could never comprehend its
mental outlook —if such a land be not mys-
terious where shall we look for mystery?
Japan is still in some respects a Land of
Upside Down. Economy of labor, contrary
to popular belief, is little known or prac-
tised. In a railway gang men swing their
picks to the accompaniment of a song, and
the rhythm is taken from the slowest man.
(It is, perhaps, coming to that in Australia.)
In erecting a house the framework of the
l'oof is carefully built and fitted on the
ground, then taken apart and put together
all over again in its place up above. The
other parts are not fashioned on the pre-
mises; they are made elsewhere and brought
to the building to be . pieced together. The
‘tiles are fitted to the roof with mud, which is
tossed up from hand to hand, six men form-
ing a chain for the purpose. To wash a
kimono you rip it apart, wash the pieces
separately, dry them on a board and sew
them together again. The rule of the road
is driving to the left. “When a procession
of automobiles is going along a road and
one of them is, for some reason, required
to stop, the cars which follow do not blow
their horns and dash by in delight and a
cloud of dust; they draw up behind the sta-
tionary car. If it becomes necessary for
them to go on the chauffeurs who do .so
apologise for passing. This custom, which
is dying out, comes, I fancy, from the rick-
shaw-men, who never overtake and pass each
other on the road, but always fall in behind
the slowest runner.” Evidently Western in-
fhienco has not sent its roots so deep down
into the national character as some of us
imagined.
The woman of Japan is the nation’s crown-
ing glory. “Before this ethical creation.”
wrote Hearn, “criticism should hold its
breath.” Yet there is much in the position
of the ethical creation that suggests a thinly
disguised servitude. For instance, a hus-
band and father may take a concubine to
live in his house without giving ground for
divorce. On the other hand, a husband
and a wife who desire a divorce may easily
obtain it by stating the fact to the court.
Marriages for love seldom occur, and the
girls look enviously at other countries where
love-marriages are the rule. Marriages are
usually arranged by older married couples,
who act as go-betweens; family convenience
or advantage is the principal factor con-
sidered. The functions of a go-between are
very responsible. For example, a leper may
not marry, and leprosy is a ground for
divorce, not only in the case of the victim,
but in the case of his or her close blood rela-
tions. There is a terrible dread of leprosy
in Japan, and statistics are hard to get be-
cause families in which a case occurs make
great efforts to conceal it. The Home Office
puts down the number of lepers at 64,000.
init specialists say this is under the real
figure. “In certain parts where leprosy is
common,” writes Street, “there are. rich fami-
lies having beautiful daughters for whom it
is impossible to find husbands in the neigh-
borhood because of rumor that the dread dis-
ease is in the blood. Such families often
move to the cities, where the girls find hus-
bands through matrimonial advertisements.”
Not always was woman’s position inferior
to that of man. In the eighth century suc-
cessive empresses occupied the Imperial
throne, and the influence of certain able
women was strongly felt; two centuries later
came a great era of literary women whose
fame still endures. Buddhism and Confu-
cianism changed all this. The Buddhist doc-
trine called women creatures of sin. treacher-
ous and cruel. Confucius says: “When a boy
is born let him play with jewels; when a girl
is born let her play with tiles.” So it came
that woman’s position declined until a famous
moralist could write: “A woman should look
upon her husband as if he were Heaven it-
self, and never weary of thinking how she
may yield to him and so escape celestial casti-
gation.” in Japan, as we all know, vice is
frankly commercialised and recognised as
such. The shofji are segregated in certain
specified districts, and there are no street-
walkers. All autliorites on Japan agree with
Chamberlain, who sayis that “the fallen
women of Japan are, as a class, much less
vicious than their representatives in the
West, being neither drunken nor foul-
mouthed.” They have also a high reputation
for honesty. The Japanese work on the
theory that, as this evil cannot be stamped
out of existence, the next best thing is to
stamp it, as far as possible, out of the public
consciousness. It has yet to be proved that
we Europeans can show any improvement
on the Japanese system.
In Japan you buy an earthenware pot of
tea and a small cup from a boy vendor when
you are travelling and leave it in the train
when you are done with it. It always goes
back to the owner. Public property and
monuments are much respected; vandalism is
almost unknown. Such a proceeding as the
shocking despoliation of Thomas Jefferson’s
beautiful mansion at Monticello, Virginia,
would be impossible in Nippon. There
patriotism is uni versa’!, and examples of
exquisite feeling are not rare. At a banquet
in New York in honor of Viscount Shibusawa,
Hr. Finley remarked that, he had heard that
the viscount had sent a vyreath to be laid on
the grave of Townsend Harris, first TJ.S.
Minister to Japan. “Not.” said Shibusawa.
"I did not send a wreath. I took it myself
and laid it on the grave. And I wrote two
poems in memory of Townsend Harris and
hung them in the branches of a Japanese
maple overhanging his resting-place.”
Street’s style as a writer is lucid and pic-
turesque. His beautifully illustrated book is
worthy of a permanent place in any man s
library. Possibly he sees things Japanese a
trifle couleur de rose, but there are .saffron
roses, and some of them amazingly beautiful.

Facts, Fiction and Dreams
Modern scientific analysis of dreams opens
up a wide field of thought. From one point
of view it induces a wider charity. It re-
strains us from hastily branding a brother-
man as liar—he may not. relate facts within
his knowledge yet may believe lie does so.
Fact and fiction become at times inextricably
mixed in the mind. Those who practise in
law courts, or physicians who have much to
do with neural troubles, are frequently face
to face ivitli this problem. Somehow, some-
where, the brain has tucked away in its grey
matter pictures, either visualised or mental-
ised as fact, their true dockets being con-
fused. Everyone knows what a snowball,
gathering size as it rolls, a scanty bit of
scandal may become. Quite unconsciously,
in most cases, each hearer as he passes it on
adds a touch of color or an accessory or
fiction out of his temperamental self, bo
it is that the problem to a Judge is not so
much the determination upon the evidence
presented to him as an analysis of the whole
body with a view to the probabilities, of
truth. Even a > vivid dream may be seized
on and stored away with the library of re-
corded facts in the mind. So common is
this that the exclamation, “Oh, you dreamt
it!” is the frequent reproach of doubtful
authenticity. Yet the narrator may verit-
ably believe that he did hear or see that par-
ticular conversation or happening.
An interesting little book, Dreams and
lloio to Interpret Them (Cecil Palmer), nar-
rates a curious instance of this confusion
of fact and fiction in the storehouse of the
mind. The case relates to a well-known
statesman and litterateur. Towards the
close of the first Wembley Exhibition the
civic authorities of Liverpool held a festival
week in the Exhibition grounds. . Among
other invited guests Avas Mr. Augustine Bir-
rell, who wa.s asked to address those present
on the literary associations of the great
shipping city. Unable to attend in person,
Birrell wrote “a charming account of a
visit of Charles Dickens to the city to dis-
tribute the prizes at a girls’ high school.
Among the prize-winners was a young lady
who. on being asked her name by Dickens,
replied, to the immense amusement of the
audience, ‘Weller.’ Her Christian name
was Christina, and she eventually became
Lad v Butler, the painter of Avar pictures.”
Mr. Birrell stated that lie had been an eye-
witness of this occurrence, and the unim-
peachable character of the narrator satisfied
all of its veracity except the one out of a
hundred. Mr. Matz. a Avcll-knoAvn Dickens
scholar, read the account, and proceeded to
turn up authorities. He found that the
little incident of Avhicli Mr. Birrell believed
himself to have been a av it ness had as a
matter of fact occurred seven years before
that gentleman Avas born. “Yet Mr. Birrell,
though convinced by facts that his memory
had been at fault, had. in fact, fully and
honestly believed lie had been present .on the
occasion, and had often related the incident
before.”
The memory of Napoleon has been likened
to a nest of boxes or pigeon-holes, to each
of Avhicli he could Avithout even momentary
hesitation apply, and in which lay. all the
detail of any particular matter he wished to
recall. Without carrying the analogy too
far, it is possible to imagine a mix-up in
the boxes and a confusion of contents, but
the docketing as experiences of matters which
are not facts Avitliin our knowledge requires
au appeal to psychology. The anonymous
author of the book under notice suggests that
Mr. Birrell, reading of the incident, had pro-
bably often wished that he had been present
at it. so much so that he had eventually
visualised it in a dream. This dream had
been repeated time after time, until it be-
came a part of his Avaking mind. This seems
rather far-fetched. The commonscnse ex-
planation suggests itself that, as avc mem-
orise both facts knoAvn to us out of our oavii
experience and facts made known to us out of
the experiences of others, in course of time
the strict line of demarcation between the two
becomes faint and sometimes obliterated.
There are children of the present generation
who frankly regard pioneer grandsires
with their tales of stupendous* achievements
as impolite liars. No doubt as they advanced
in years the old fireside heroes did color up
the privations and endurances of the. early
days of settlement. Mr. Birrell is.getting on
in years, and the tissue-paper division be-
tAveen fact and fiction may be breaking away.
That dreams may become incorporated into
the material of recorded facts in our brain
seems to be reasonably certain. There are
times when remote memories thrust up from
the subconscious into the conscious field and
avc hesitate between. fact and fiction. We
are not, consciously, liars to ourselves, and yet
we may be, and believing Ave speak the truth
we may give false testimony. If Ave grip this
fact it' may do not a little to help others—
unconscious liars like ourselves. The ‘un-
bottled”' man is often on the Avay to dementia
or the asylum. After the Avar thousands, of
ex-soldiers dreamt bal tie-dreams. They tried
to kill them or drive them under, to thrust
the memories of those aAvful days deen doAvn
into the hidden recesses of the mind. But
when night came the grisly spectres haunted
the unhappy dreamers. Then the Avisdom of
psychotherapy came to their aid. They were
told not to suppress those devils from the
undermind but to bid them come forth. To.
in fact, “uncork” themselves, to relate their
experiences, to seize eveiw willing or unwill-
ing listener by the third button of the waist-
coat and let him suffer the upwell of flies '
suppressed emotions and memories. The
devils being cast out, sleep, sweet and unde-
filed, returned.
T. B. C,
One of Northcliffe’s Young Men
William Beach Thomas dearly loves a
lord. This is painfully evident in A Travel-
er in News, the gentleman's latest contri-
bution to contemporary history. You get an
earnest of what is to come from the title-
page; tlie book is written by ‘‘Sir William
Beach Thomas, K.8.E.” Moving on, yon
run into page after page of no particular
moment regarding “tutors at the House,” the
vagaries of Northcliffe, and the idiosyncrasies
of divers Sir Horaces and Sir Rowlands. And
there is a touching note from Lord Inchcape to
all captains on the line by which the author
was travelling, requesting them to “give Sir
William and his staff the very best accommo-
dation” ....
Coming from a casual sycophant, such rub-
bish might be ignored; but Thomas is built
of better stuff. He is a moderately-graceful
writer, doubtless a brave man, an athlete of
sorts, and something of a naturalist. Super-
ficially, then, this was about the last person
one would have expected to be priggishly
patronising to Australians, to be (on his own
showing) merely rude in odd cases, to bungle
names in a manner that would get a junior
reporter the sack, and to disseminate natural
history of an order not much better than the
amazing “facts” about Australian fauna cir-
culated by Northcliffe himself. (Shall we
ever forget the Harmsworth discovery of the
“Johanna,” the wonderful Australian rep-
tile?) I pass without comment Thomas’s
allusion to old John Burroughs, of America,
as “that delightful naturalist, Mr. Bur-
roughes,” also his shipboard discovery of
Harwell, of South Australia, as “the most
downright statesman in the Empire,” and
come to his adventures in our cultureless
land. It would appear from this book that
half Sydney was waiting to greet the new-
born knight. Through this hypothetical
throng pushed a menial with a request that
Zur William should dine with someone.
Zur William was busy with affairs of State,
of course, but he waved a princely, if absent-
minded, acquiescence, after which the matter
“left his mind immediately.” In due course,
however, the car arrived, the knight em-
barked, and a very merry evening ensued. It
was only on the way back that the wanderer
learned, “by judicious inquiry,” who his host
was—“ Mr." Mclntosh, a proprietor of news-
papers and theatres,” who “has an ambition
to be a Lord Northcliffe,” and is acquainted,
one gathers, with a certain “Gilbert Car-
rutliers, an ex-Premier.”
From Sydney the author went to Queens-
land. He was invited there, as I chance
to know, by northern ornithologists, whose
feathers rutiled when their telegram drew no
reply. But they relented later and arranged
for Thomas to see sheep and wild birds on
Alice Downs station, Blackall. 800 miles
from Brisbane. No mention of this courtesy
appears in Thomas’s book: he simply tells
the world that the news of his knightly pres-
ence had extended to a sheep-station, “over
many thousands of miles!” The host, David
Gaukrodger, is an eminent Australian
naturalist. Thomas, who stayed with him
for several days, dismisses him as “Mr. Gauk-
Rodgers,” varied by “Mr. Gawk-Rodgers.” I
suppose we must not expect a Man of
Affairs, one who has rubbed shoulders with
the Great of the Earth, to bother about
the Christian names or surnames of his hosts,
even if they are among the best-known men
in Australia. Nor must we, presumably,
expect him to know, when he writes about a
“sudden zeal for bird-protection” seizing
Central Queensland, that the virile conserve-
tion association there has been actisc for
over 20 years. ... , .
The truth seems to be that to a certain
type of Englishman Australia can never be
more than a small boy. An urchin to be
humored by tasting his lollypop, and then
patted benignantly, addressed as lommy
(his name being Billy) and urged to run
away and grow up.
PHIL ANTIIUS.
A Satchel of Books
Monsieur Rvpois and Nemesis, by Louis Hemon
(Allen and Unwin). Among the papers of the late
M. Hein on was found the MS. of the present. work,
a translation of which is submitted to English
readers. It is essentially Gallic in its sex interest,
but the author shows a fairly intimate knowledge
of London, where the plot of the novel is laid. The
graphic story of a loathsome little beast.
Memories and Reflections, by Lady Troubridge
(Heinemann). In early life the author was inti-
mately acquainted with many distinguished men,
including Tennyson, G. F. Watts and Leighton, and
in close touch with the theatrical and artistic life
of the later Victorian era. Her sister Rachel,
Countess of Dudley, was the wife of a one-time
Governor-General of the Commonwealth. The book
is written in an easy gossiping style.
The Truth About Kitchener, by Victor Wallace
Germains (The Bod ley Head). Frankly partisan
rather than critical. The writer lays himself out to
prove that it was the Kitchener armies which turned
the balance of military power in Europe, and taxes
his countrymen with ingratitude in that, when the
war had been won, there was . nobody in authority
to “suggest some fitting public monument to the
memory of the man whose strength and genius,
whose foresight and resolve had proserved the
British Empire from destruction.”
The Victories of Failure, by C. J. de Garis (Modern
Printing Co., Melbourne). Over 500 pages of tumid
stuff dealing with the author’s excursions into the
fields of frenzied finance. Some pretence is made of
using assumed names ; the central figure is Kenneth
J. Rogers, but most of the other pseudonyms are
so transparent that they were hardly worth conferring.
The characters are all addicted to expressing them-
selves in a breathless staccato ; a general air of stagey
unreality hangs over everything, including the busi-
ness ventures that peter out. Much worse than the
style is the shocking taste exhibited by the introduc-
tion of the author’s domestic affairs into the account
of his commercial mishaps.
ITung! by Frank Penn-Smith (Chatto and Win-
ders). The author, an Englishman, spent some
portion of his life in the Commonwealth, and many
years ago published a book of verses in Tasmania.
This local knowledge accounts for the all-round
accuracy of the descriptive matter in such of the
short stories collected in this volume as deal
with Australian subjects. Some of the yarns have
appeared in The Bulletin. The range covered by
the 23 tales within the covers is wide enough to
meet the tastes of many readers. The author knows
Africa as familiarly as he docs our own land and
touches a fresh interest in a number of quaintly
told animal fables.
Modern Economic History, by H. Heaton (Workers
Educational Association). A third edition, with one-
third of the total space devoted to Australia. In-
cluded in the contents is an excellent, resume of the
various legislative enactments securing the State
regulation of wages in Australia. The .movement
in this direction is dated from the maritime strike
of 1890. Looking back over 30 years, the author
comes to this conclusion: “No one now believes
that industrial arbitration can bring industrial peace
by coercion, and probably no one believes that the
abolition of the whole system would bring undiluted
good. In times of economic instability and oi
revolutionary ideas, the machinery will always ne
seriously strained. But in more humdrum days it
operates fa i rly smoothly. ”


When does your Ford
get Oil —
any old time, or at the right time?
When the car needs it—or when you think it
needs it? When the fit takes you—or do you
follow out the directions—as, of course, you
should do—given by the makers, the people
who know more about the machine and its
requirements than anyone else?
Of all the cars on the road there is none calling
for greater regularity in oiling and greasing
than the fiord.. The manufacturers long ago
realised this, and have embodied in their book
concerning the car very definite instructions
that oil must be added to the motor every
hundred miles, that oil should be added to the
oil cups and grease to the grease cups every
200 miles, and that at the end of each 500
miles oil should be applied to all bearing
surfaces.
They are not carelessly-drawn-up directions
these; they are simple and definite, and have
been compiled by men who know exactly the
lubrication requirements of the Ford, and
whose desire is to see you get the very best and
the longest possible service from the car.
This oiling and greasing of the popular Ford
becomes a simple matter when once you have
installed on your instrument-board the Stewart
Ford Speedometer, for it actually signals to you
when it is time to add some oil or to put some
more grease in the cups!
The special Ford instrument made by the
manufacturers of the world-famous Stewart
Speedometer has a number of colored dials in
its mileage recorder, and the appearance of one
of these discs is the signal that some part is due
to receive oil or grease. A glance at the neat
metal tablet suspended from the speedometer,
or a reference to the pocket-book chart sup-
plied, tells the part or parts, and whether oil
or grease (or both) is needed.
No uncertainty, no guess work, no need to
remember when you last put oil in the motor
or grease in the cups—-the Stewart Ford
Speedometer does your remembering for you
—and saves you the trouble. It’s a speed
register, a mileage recorder and an oil guide
all in one. PRICE 80/-

This Way Walked One.
In that land there is no waking,
Yet I know when leaves come shaking
Green of the sea-buds and green of the trees,
This way and that on the little wild breeze,
Dreams shall be ours for taking—
And who shall mind never waking?
In that land there is no sleeping.
Yet I feel when night comes creeping,
Soft as a spirit, grey as a dove,
Over and over low-murmuring her love,
Hope shall be ours for keeping;
And not one shall mind never sleeping.
In that land dwells God with Mis peoples,
Softly as bells chime in steeples.
He knows them, and misses not one ;
He nourished awhile with Ilis sun.
Listen! Look! There a flower-bud is
waking—
A sleeping seed. . . .hush !. .. .is breaking.

Sonnets of the Bush Flowers.
I.
Fear not my hand, sweet flowers; ’tis numb
and cold
With memories of many-sorrowed blooms
Destined to fade in dull, depressing rooms,
Where winds stray never, nor the weavers
fold
The friendly mantle of their airy gold,
Luxuriant woven on these sunset looms.
I come as one that ventures forth from tombs
Into the work that Death is famed to hold
Beyond the voiceless dust, with eyes that
strive
Vainly to grasp the boundless offerings,
Too beautiful on earth to be alive.
And, kneeling here, my waking spirit springs
Out of the trappings of its shallow clod,
And soars above the very throne of God.
it.
Symbols of laughter, love and liberty.
The song, the all of life thrice echoing!
Mow pity gushes for that prisoned thing
The orchid, doomed in hothouse, bonds to be,
Ensign of nought but cold captivity :
Mow merciless its guard, close, shuttering
Its pampered beauty from the winds that sing
Forever here the brave songs of the free.. . .
Beyond the fragrant heath I hear the tread
Of hosts that fling across the narrow world
A banner dyed with blood their fathers shed ;
Our own fair emblem o’er the earth unfurled.
And, 10, their voices chant the praise of thee,
Who taught their hearts the wealth of
liberty!
111.
Out of the west the dying day has thrust
Caressing arms to fondle thee adieu.
To-morrow, oh, how many that lie knew
.Shall be down-trodden in the secret dust!
But not this night can bitter keening gust
Bite to my heart and tear it through and
through:
Its shield is wrought of metal that not rue
Nor fear nor fate can penetrate nor rust.
No, not this night nor any day unborn —
For thou hast taught me how to live and die;
And as thy seed shall greet to-morrow’s morn,
So I have one to bear my image nigh.
Farewell, bush flowers; our lovely day has
run—-
As fragrant be thy seed, as fond my son !

Transfigured stand, O bright barbaric hordes!
Motionless, silent, flaunt no richer hue
Of amethyst or flame or purple-red!
Princes and potentates rise upon thrones
Of gold and ruby; part their streaming robes
Of royal purple, and unsheath great stvords,
Tempered and bright, from scabbards jewel

Oh. they will do ensanguined, burning deeds,
Make sport with kingdoms, dice for wheeling
worlds.
A cry! “Huzza! Huzza! Huzza! Huzza!”
A tortured face; the gleam of dark-liued flesh
Upon a sword’s point; dripping, warm, wet

That plashes into pools. O rubied realm
Of victory and hate and fire —and death !
Come then, ye jealous-blooded, dark-haired

And fill the flagons up with yellow wine!
A thousand at a time rise ye and fill
The madness-tinctured cup
That we may dream a thousand misty dreams
Of forests ’neath the moon and river-banks
Where wild beasts prowl and creatures come
to drink.
And night, like a great bat, spreads ebon
wings
Over the jungle, shrieking for her prey,
And tearing with her claws the moon’s silk
veil.
Down in the pools the lily’s silver cup
Is folded jealous o’er some secret still
That brews enchanted nectar to decoy
Anon, some painted, thirst-tormented fly.
Ah, they will dream of palaces of pearl
Beneath a silvern dawn, and slanting eyes
Peeping from peerless brows,
And waxen, waiting arms; and soother sighs
Than e’er passed carmined mortal lips shall
breathe
Upon their dreaming ears. Ay! they shall
dream
As I am dreaming now. Oh. flowers, flowers!
What are you doing here, scaring the rose
And filling this pale plot
With pain and passion and life’s beating
blood?
Oh, zinnias, die! Die quickly ere I beat
Them down, the tender, pale-lipped company
Of lovely lilied things. I am afire
With all the pent-up passion of the past!
You set me throbbing with the old, old ache
For burning words, and scimitars, and stars,
That sear the night and limn the day in gold.
“Huzza” they cry, the crazy populace,
And in my upturned face
One throws a reeking rose.
VICTORIA.

A SERMON IN A GULLY.
Literature suffered a loss in the fact that
Charles Dickens hadn't the chance to see
S. M. Bruce, of Australia, in his celebrated
character as a Prime Minister, and add him
to the unrivalled collection where he rightly
belongs. Then he might have achieved im-
mortality along with Lord Coodle and Sir
Thomas Doodle and the Right Hon. Wil-
liam Buffy, also the Barnacles and the
Stilt-Stalking s and their polite and lan-
guid kith and kin. The exceedingly unsatis-
factory Hughes, Avhen his party would en-
dure Jus freakish leadership no longer, passed
his mantle to Bruce, as a successor who
wouldn’t make his oavii record seem too poor
by comparison, and the successor fills the bill
to perfection. He is partly what he was
born and partly what his environment made
him. He was heir to a fortune made by
importing and by as much Freetrade as the
firm could obtain. The concern was regis-
tered in England, and had its headquarters
there, and the Prime Minister spent part.
at least, of his active business career in that
Freetrade atmosphere, and got the best part
of his education there likewise. Two matters
regarding which he is not accused of know-
ing much are land (which includes pioneer-
ing work and land-settlement) and manu-
factures. A third, regarding which he is not
accused of knowing anything at all, is hoAV
to put on even a colorable imitation of velo-
city, except perhaps in the floating of loans.
It is difficult to imagine a crisis which would
make it imperative to rush to the assistance
of the importing and wholesale hawking
business, for that has no fortune invested in
machinery, and is consequently not anchored
down in a particular spot nor tied to a par-
ticular industry. It can run its business
in various States, and can open in neAV fields
should the grass in the old ones run short,
and it can try trading in agricultural imple-
ments and flat-irons if tlie fluff market be
depressed. But a vast manufacturing con-
cern, employing hundreds of thousands of
Australian workers, may perish right out if
some freak in the course of exchange reduces
its Protection to less than nil and gives the
importer command of the market, and it may
do so in less time than it takes a Bruce
Government to collect its thoughts concern-
ing an anomaly in the whisky duty. There
is no reason to suppose that the affluent ex-
importing Prime Minister or his affluent
medical land-owning colleague was ever per-
sonally up against an industrial problem which
called for prompt action, and speed is not in
them.
* * * *
There is a real industrial trouble on hand,
as is evidenced by three matters. One is the
increasing scarcity of employment, the re-
sult of factories closing or working part-
time. Another is the growing difficulty which
factories experience in earning enough pro-
fit to make it worth while to keep open. A third
is the fierce and continuous borrowing abroad
(in London, and in New York when London
runs dry) to provide for ordinary foreign
liabilities, which could be met out of Aus-
tralia’s own resources if the country had
fewer imports to pay for. In such circum-
stances a pronouncement from the Prime
Minister seemed in order, and he made one.
A telegraph summary aims at giving the most
forcible aspects of a great man’s speech, and
this was Bruce in his intensive moments: —•
An indirect allusion to the tariff was made by the
Prime Minister at a complimentary dinner given to
him by the Ferntree Gully Shire Council. Mr.
Bruce said that the time had come when Australia
must proceed along the lines of sane and sound
development. In future mistakes could not be
made without serious results. Primary and secondary
industries were interdependent. It was essential that
the problems of the one class should be considered
in the light of their possible effect upon other, and
perhaps greater and more important, aspects, national
as well as industrial.
Even the notable Mr. Pecksniff, who was
non-committal in his remarks, but “fuller of
virtuous precept than a copybook,” couldn’t
have put the case better than that. The
speech, unless the report did it shameful in-
justice, was fit for a gully, and a shire coun-
cil was a fitting audience, and dinner, which
is an unromantic and often stupefying meal,
was a fitting accompaniment. It is a pity
that the Prime Minister didn’t realise earlier
that the time has always come for sane and
sound development, and that it is generally
advisable to abandon crazy and decayed stag-
nation, and chance the consequences. And
it is a further pity that there should be such
a note of doubt, caution and hesitation about
starting to be sane and sound,_ and the risk
of so many unsound loans being raised in
the time of waiting.
«. * * *
The general attitude of the allegedly Pro-
tectionist Government is that Protection is
a bad .thing, to be doled out grudgingly, like
the food at Dothcboys Hall, lest industries
should grow up strong and vigorous, instead
of being stunted and tangled in their
emaciated legs. It assumes, though it pro-
bably doesn’t know why, that free importing
is the natural state of man, and that any
departure from it is unavoidable sin. It
believes ahvays in giving the outsider and
his importing representative (who is often
an outsider himself with headquarters
abroad) the benefit of the doubt, and the
Australian manufacturer the drawback there-
of. It requires the manufacturer to prove
his case to the hilt before the Tariff Board,
while the importer’s case proves itself. The
attitude of the tribunal referred to is that
unless the local Jones shows, beyond the
hundredth part of a shadow of disbelief, that
the dog is his, it reverts to the outsider
Smith, because all dogs naturally revert to
Smith. A long timd is required to demon-
strate to the Tariff Board anything that is
of advantage to Australia. It is a slow-
moving body, and listens with infinite
patience to witnesses who have naught to
say except that such-and-such a proposed
duty will “injure the importing business” —•
as if injury to the importing business wasn’t
the one thing aimed at. Then time is re-
quired to think and report, and after that
a small ocean of leisure drifts by before the
gentleman who orates so beautifully in gul-
lies gets the Parliamentary machine in
motion, if he ever does. The present impres-
sion is that the approaching tariff reform will
finish by those industries which have strug-
gled as far as a favorable report stage hav-
ing/or some of them having, something done
for them, but as little as possible and less
if it can be managed.
* * * *
Great Britain also has its industrial pro-
blem. and it became acute the other day. If
the Cold Country borrowed, say, £350,000,000
per annum to keep the pot boiling, which
Avould be doing, in proportion to population,
as Australia does, its troubles would pro-
bably be no worse than ours. And if Aus-
tralia met its obligations as honestly as Bri-
tain does the torpid Bruce would either
have to provide some tariff or run the risk
of finding skeleton constituents outside his
suburban door. The trouble in the Ma Land
is the same as ours. The tariff lets in more
imports than the exports can pay for, and it
lets in more than the people can use without
wrecking the market for local products and
doing great damage to local industry. Stan-
ley Baldavin recognises the situation if
Stanley Bruce doesn’t. Across the Atlan-
tic is a rival whom he desires to imitate.
Within the time of persons not yet in re-
ceipt of Christian burial the United States
also had a mission to grow raw materials
and send them abroad in return for manu-
factured goods. It also borrowed in London,
and its industries, railways included, were
largely, if not mostly, owned outside. But
new statesmen arose who believed in giving
the local manufacturer the benefit of the
doubt every time —and the whole benefit. If
they were told that 20 per cent. Protection
was required they gave 40 per cent, so that
there might be a margin for trade fluctuations.
When the agent for foreign producers came
round, as he does to Australia’s Tariff
Board, with a wail that such-and-such a
duty would destroy the importing business
they replied that that Avas their mission in
life, and that they would gladly destroy the
importing industry twice over, and then once
more for luck. Freetrade wiseacres told
them, as they tell us in the Moaning Her-
ald and similar organs, that no country can
sell merchandise abroad unless it accepts
full payment in merchandise, this being a
law ever since the days of Adam, who lived
in the Garden of Eden, and whose other
name was Smith. The new men said they
would try a different doctrine, for a while
anyhow. So they fixed their tariff with an
express purpose of selling much merchandise
and buying little so long as there were happy-
go-lucky countries like England and Aus-
tralia to practise on. With the surplus Uncle
bought back his own securities till he was
free of foreign debt, a consummation which
seems unbelieA 7 able to our Bruces and the
rest of the slipshod political crew. Then he
took to buying other people’s securities till
a multitude of foreigners were in debt to
him, and he piled up an immensity of gold
and silver to boot. The process can’t go on
at the same pace for ever, but it has been,
and still is, a very interesting and profitable
process. If this country could get a GoArnrn-
ment made of men like those who created
the neiv era in the United States, and give
in exchange its collection of mild and preachy
borrowing futilities, it would be a great deed,
and, in fact, another Reformation.
THE SLOW PACE OF THE LAW.
Australian civil law is developing along
lines of long-windedness which threaten to
lead to immortality, and in the case of a
very rich litigant with a bad temper and a
good solicitor the chance of the ordinary
brand of opponent, however just his case,
is hardly worth writing home about. If
two litigants of equal resources and staying
power got together on a mixed matter they
Avould probably require a terrace of courts
to themselves, and probably complete justice
would be done, but such a combination is
rare. Two recent instances show some
of the possibilities of the system, but pro-
bably not near all of them. In the matter
of Kidman, Mayoh and Co., the Federal
Government refused to take delivery of cer-
tain ships in course of construction, having
got a report that they were an undesirable
lot. “Cross actions then arose,” as Avas
natural when one party wanted to be paid
the rest of the price and the other wanted
to be repaid what it had parted Avith already.
They were abandoned in favor of arbitra-
tion, which resulted in an award of £76,000
in favor of the Government. The shipbuild-
ers made pilgrimages from court to court to
have the arbitration aAvard set aside, with
poor but lengthy results. Then the Com-
monwealth secured a judgment in the N. S.
Wales State Supreme Court for payment of
the money, and the shipbuilders got autho-
rity from the same court to appeal to the
Privy Council against payment of the money,
and the Federal High Court, being applied
to, cancelled the permission of the Supreme
Court to appeal to the Privy Council against
its own order for payment of the money.
Then it would seem from rather scanty in-
formation that the shipbuilders appealed to
the Privy Council direct for permission to
appeal to the Pri\ 7 y Council against the Fed-
eral High Court’s action in forbidding it to
appeal to the Privy Council as authorised by
the State Supreme Court, and that it failed.
It is now reported that the indomitable firm
proposes to take the case before the High
Court on other grounds, and that the end is
not in sight, and possibly not the middle
either. All this has no bearing on the merits
of the case, which presumably exist. At the
worst the bill, however big, won’t be much
per inhabitant, and if the shipbuilding firm
is enjoying itself there is little harm done.
The casu is the rare sort in which there is
abundant money on both sides.
* * * *
A similar matter seems to have reached
finality. The N. S. AVales Supreme Court
gave to the Limerick S. S. Co. a verdict of
£19,480 and costs against the Commonwealth
and Scott Fell, M.L.A., on the ground that
the Commonwealth commandeered two of the
company’s ships during the war and let them
to the Scott Fell firm, which profited much
thereby instead of the owners profiting. Both
losers appealed, and the State Full Supreme
Court reversed the judgment of the State
ordinary (or partially empty) Supreme
Court. This is a matter of such frequent
occurrence that it is hardly worth while
calling the court “Supreme” much longer.
It also grafted to the company which had
lost its verdict “conditional leave” to appeal
to the Privy Council, and find out if the
Full Supreme Court Avas wrong in deciding
the Plain Supreme Court wasn’t right, and
it was authorised to do this without taking
the High Court on its way. The High Court,
being appealed to, cancelled the Full Supreme
Court’s leave of appeal to the Privy Council,
holding that it had to be taken on the way,
and must on no account be passed over. So
the Limerick S. S. Co. carried its case, now
in its seventh or eighth year, a stage further,
with a A 7 iew to getting the Federal High
Court to reverse the action of the State’s
Large Supreme Court in reversing the judg-
ment of the State’s Smaller Supreme Court,
or else getting the High Court’s authority
to appeal against itself to the Privy Council.
Here the company let go suddenly, possibly
for lack of patience and possibly for lack of
means to fight the Government and Trea-
sury of a whole continent and some islands
any longer, and so it lost its verdict and its
costs. It will be remembered that the Jarn-
dyce Chancery suit also ended suddenly, and
the language which Dickens used concerning
the heart-breaking endlessness of the law
Avas a fine effort of invective. There is a
jury at the beginning of snob cases as quoted,
and a jury is supposed to be a palladium or
some elderly contraption of the sort, but it
has about as much bearing on things as a
sparrow at the beginning of a forest.
* * * *
One possible mitigation of the sinful situa-
tion would be for the Commonwealth to
establish a system of courts of its own, after
the fashion of the United States with its
Federal District Courts (88 of them), Court
of Claims, Court of Customs Appeal, Circuit
Courts of Appeal and Supreme Court. Then
the litigant with a case of any size which he
intended to carry to the topmost tribunal
would begin bis fight in a Federal court, or
his intended victim would get it removed
there, and all the ruinous subsequent wan-
derings from State justice to Federal jus-
tice, and back again, and forward again, and
then all round about might be eliminated
This would greatly diminish the importance
of the State Supreme Courts, but they could
still sit in their fully-manned capacity to
reverse the decisions they had given in their
one-man capacity. Something (but not
much) might be said for the Turkish method
before it degenerated in the rottenness of the
Hamidian regime. Then the upright Judge
of a civil court prepared his decision, against
which there was very little appeal, in a spirit
of fair dealing, and sent his man to the
Avinner for the recognised fee. If it wasn’t
forthcoming he might regretfully sell the case
to the wrong party, but the fee generally Avas
forthcoming, and the expense was usually
less than under the Australian system in its
present lumbering development. The first
sign of degeneracy was noticed Avhen his
Ottoman Honor ceased to employ a man, and
called round for the fee himself, and the
second when he started to sell the judgment
to both parties.
A HERITAGE OF PEACE.
A blubbed orange sunset, confused and low,
dropped down behind the Kremlin, bronzing
the stern old walls and tipping the ancient
towers and cupolas with mellowness.
“Only the Kremlin above Moscow, and
only God above the Kremlin,” murmured
Ivan Ivanovitch, as tve stood for a moment
or two on a side street of the old city and
gazed in silent admiration at the romance
and the poetry and the loveliness of it all.
And then, as the grey veils of the twilight
fell, we turned and entered the modest home,
where, unknown to the dreaded “Chekka,”
I was staying and studying at first hand the
heart-beats of the Bolshevik organism.
Ivan, young, lovable, enthusiastic and
aflame with Slavonic fire, was a Russian
of the Russians. In him was that subtle
mingling of the East and West, that strange,
mystical, indefinable, indescribable something
called Slav. And his Moscow home and
everything in it was just as typically Russian.
The Western world seemed so unreal, so
remote, so A 7 ery far aAvay as I sat down to
supper in the cosy little room, with the holy
ikons hanging in the corner, the samovar
bubbling, and Ivan and his friends, all blue-
eyed, blonde-haired Russian students, sitting
around.
“Ivan Ivanovitch, do you honestly be-
-1 ieve in the Bolshevik Government?” I asked,
leaning over and looking at him across the
table.
“Niet!” he answered at once.
“Niet, niet!” reiterated his companions.
“Then why don’t you overthroiv it and
substitute a Giwernment you do believe in?”
I inquired.
Cool, deliberate and convincing was his
reply: “Ah, Guspodine, we Russians have
had enough of overthrowing and killing. We
have been doing nothing else for seven years,
and we are sick and tired of it all. God in
Heaven, we want peace. That’s Avhy.”
“Da,” joined in Vasily. “Overthrowing
the Bolsheviki means more killing and fight-
ing, and we don’t want any more of that.
We are home, and Ave want to stay home,
and we don’t Avant to take up arms against
the Bolsheviki or anybody else.”
“Better a bad Government and peace than
a good Government and w 7 ar.” added
Nicolai.
“Da, da,” said one of the others. “No
more war. War’s bad.”
Not only in Moscoav. but all over Russia
I heard this same denunciation of war, this
same great longing for peace and rest. I
heard it in Petrograd, where the great Peter
still sits on his giant horse, there on the
banks of the Neva, “grieving, if aught inani-
mate e’er grieves.” over the death-struggles
of his beloved city. I heard it in Novgorod,
where of old the world assembled for the
great fair. I heard it in Kiev, in Kazan, in
a dozen other cities and villages.
From Russia I went to Turkey, arriving
there when the threat of another war was
hanging over the Near East. Smyrna was
in flames, the Greeks were defeated and re-
treating, and the Turks, intoxicated with
victory, were following close and threatening
to re-enter Europe, with the sword drawn
and the scabbard hurled away. Lloyd
George was sending battleships and soldiers
to Gallipoli to stop them: and all of the
crepe-hangers and prophets of gloom Avere
shouting from the housetops that Europe
was about to burst into flames again—and
then what?
I wanted to meet the young men of Tur-
key ; I Avanted to live with them, talk with
them, and get their viewpoint. And so. after
pushing through miles of red tape and illimit-
able mazes of officialdom, I got out into
Anatolia and met them face to face, met
hundreds of them, simple, honest Anatolian
peasant-soldiers, travel-stained and battle-
scarred, and so tired and weary after a long
and hard, albeit victorious campaign, and
hungry for news of the outside world. “Toll
lis,” they said, crowding around me. “has
Britain declared Avar on us yet?” And when
I shook my head and smiled, they pressed
closer, and anxiously inquired:
“Do you think she is going to?"
“I don’t think so,” I answered.
“You don’t think so! Why don’t you
think so?”
“Because,” I returned, “I know that my
fellow-countrymen are weary of fighting and
killing. AVe lost so heavily and suffered so
frightfully in the World War that we Avant
to try to forget all about it, and re-build
our lives in peace and happiness.”
“Then it is all over,” a young Turkish
officer spoke.
“And we can go home soon,” joined in an-
other.


“Allah is good!”
“Allah be praised!”
And with such expressions of relief and
thankfulness these young soldiers of Turkey,
on their own victorious battlefield, received
my simple statement of Britain’s desire for
peace and rest.
I was surprised, puzzled, perplexed. I
expected to find them quite different. I ex-
pected to find them defiant, challenging; for
were they not the “bloodthirsty Turks?”
and, in common with all the other followers
of the Prophet, did they not believe that it
was their sacred duty to follow up their
great victory over the Christian Greeks, and
put as many unbelievers as possible to the
sword? And so I looked at them for a
moment, and then:
“But don’t you want to follow up the
Greeks? Don't you want to fight on? Don’t
you want to war against Britain?”
“No, no. no!” they chorused. “We don’t
want to fight anybody. We want to go
home.”
Standing right in front of me was a young
fellow of about 28, a typical Anatolian Turk,
straight, clean-cut. He looked—he was —
the spirit of the New Turkey; and not even
the tattered uniform nor the grime of the
long and gruelling campaign could dull the
fire of his great love for Turkey. He seemed
to be the spokesman of this group.
“We have been fighting and killing for 12
long years,” he said. “The first Balkan War,
the second Balkan War, the World War, and
this war against Greece —wo have fought
through them all. and for ages we have had
no peace, no rest, no love, no sweetness in
our lives. Only war. war, war, with all of
its horrors and sufferings; and we are tired
of it all, and we want to go home.”
As the others nodded approval, I noticed
the prematurely grey hair, the wrinkled and
furrowed brows, the bloodshot eyesi, tile
drawn features, the tired look in their faces
and the strained note in their voices. They
were all old men, old before they were young,
with the bloom of youth gone; and few of
them were over 30.
“Few of us have seen Our homes for years,”
lie continued. And then sadly; “We have
not heard from them very often of late, and
we scarcely know where or how they are;
and so we want to find them, and live with
them in peace for the rest of our lives.”
“We have beaten the enemy,” said an-
other, “and we’ve got our country hack.
Now we want to go home.”
All over Turkey I heard the same cry.
“We are tired of war. We want peace and
home again.”
Descend into a gold-mine, and no matter
how rich it is you can find dirt if you
look for it. Exactly the same with nations.
We have always looked for the dirt in the
Near East, and we have always found it.
Now. let us look for the gold, for gold there
is. The young men of Turkey are as human
as any of us; and. like all of us, they are
tired of war, and yearn and pray for peace.
Let us shape our policies accordingly.

PLAIN ENGLISH.
The Dove of Peace.
Peace of a, more or less dependable sort has
been restored on the waterside, and calm
broods to some extent along the shore. The
ships are going to sea again, which is a good
sign. A leading feature of the settlement
is that the mostly imported trouble-makers
agree, on behalf of themselves and their Aus-
tralian subjects, to take notice of the Aus-
tralian law by which the officers of a ship
engage the crew* instead of having to take
anything, good or bad or medium, which may
be sent them. Quite apart from resentment
at the bullying attitude of the dictators, the
officers, especially of short-distance vessels,
disliked having a strange crew each trip in
much the same way as a Labor daily might
object to having a new staff sent to it from
the union offices every Monday morning. In
addition it has been conceded that, if some
man, or men, is, or are, missing at the
moment of sailing, through liquor or other
causes, the gap may be filled instead of tin 1
ship waiting indefinitely till the lost sheep
reappear. The promise, given rather as an
act of grace than anything else, that some
notice would be taken of the law in future,
was accompanied by no apology for the costly
breakage of it in the past, and it wasn't
backed up by a deposit. It is practically a
repetition of two previous promises, which
were gaily scrapped. The imported strike-
makers have lost nothing, for their pay goes on
while that of other men stop, and they have
gained limelight and advt. They make no
disguise of the fact that they are quite un-
regenerate, and the new law for the deporta-
tion of non-Australian annoyances isn’t taken
very seriously, with the Bruce-Paqe Govern-
ment for driving-power behind it. The peace
apparently doesn’t include-any abandonment
of the claim to practise job-control to the
extent of declaring a ship or a line of ships
“black.” One coastal line, which was that
color while hostilities were on, remained so
after they nominally left off, and there is no
news of the position of the victimised Fords-
dale men having improved. The Prime Min-
ister has an idea about enlarging the powers
of the Arbitration Court, which Walsh
treated so cavalierly. And lie has defined
his position by explaining that, though his
Government has charge of navigation mat-
ters. the maintaining of even a marine service
to Tasmania is not his funeral. He washes
liis hands, somewhat after the manner of
Pilate, the Dago.

Getting Away from Holy Writ.
The 44-hour maximum week for all workers
has been valiantly put on the N.'S.W. Govern-
ment programme, the Cabinet being “convinced
that a shorter working week will not act
detrimentally to industry.” Nevertheless, the
Premier has been trying hard to get the
other State Premiers into conference with
a view to getting the 44 hours applied all
round. Then the detriment, if any, will
apply all round, and there will be no invi-
dious comparisons between a 44-hour State
and the 48-hour one alongside, or between
the fox who lias lost his tail and his adjacent
toiled brother. It is an embarrassing com-
mentary that Queensland, in also adopting
the 44-hour idea, has granted a special sub-
sidy to Mount Morgan, its one really big
surviving mine, to make up for the loss and
detriment which arc inevitable, and keep
it alive. The next item on the pro-
gramme is the abolition of capital
punishment. The Ministry introduced the
new policy by reducing the sentence on
Oakes, the grotesque bigamist and woman-
slayer of Toronto, from death to life, at
the same time binding its .successors in paper
and ink bonds to make it really life, and
never to let him out in any circumstances.
In these days, when a man like William
Jennings Bryan dies of pious fervor and
overeating while in defence of the literal
rendering of Holy Writ, it is interesting to
consider how far people have got away from
Holy Writ. That volume prescribes the
death penalty for murder, disrespect to
parents, profane language and witchcraft,
and it cuts divorce proceedings short by
ordering tin* execution of the respondent and
co-re. It liberally authorises fines and flog-
ging, as brief and businesslike methods; but
the old law apparently never contemplated
the building of great expensive fortresses that
a lot of people might live and degenerate
there for long terms, with other people de-
generating there for equally long terms in
order to keep an eye on them. If the
offence was too serious to be expiated by
the short-hour methods of fine or flogging,
the old law went on the brisk Puritan maxim
that “stone-dead hath no fellow.” At the
same time it had no use at all for the five-
day week, and it put in front even of the
prohibitions against theft, perjury and im-
morality the statement-, that man is to stick
to his job from Monday to Saturday, both
inclusive. So in those days there was little
chance to attend the camel races on Saturday
afternoon, however anxious , one might be to
have a shekel on both ways.
- .
In 1924-25.
For the year which ended on .Tune 30 Aus-
tralia did the biggest export trade on its
record, which was good, and the biggest
import trade on its record save that of 1920-
21, which wasn’t quite so good. When im-
ports and exports were added together the
total trade was a record. That means that
our country, being almost entirely dependent
on other people’s ships, paid away an aston-
ishing amount for the carriage of manufac-
tured goods, many of which it might have
made itself, and of ’raw materials, many of
which it might have used itself if it had a
larger manufacturing population and didn't
import so much. Exports exceeded imports
by a little over £4,000,000, which was a great
deal better than the figures for the two pre-
vious years. But exports should have ex-
ceeded imports by over £20,000,000 if Aus-
tralia proposed to do the honest and solvent
thing, and pay its interest bill out of its
own resources instead of out of more loans.
So despite the Federal surplus, which is
paper (and a ton of such paper wouldn’t buy
a bun for a tame Zoological bear in London),
and despite the record trade, the rush to the
pawnshop continued. On March 31,1925, the
Federal Government alone owed £16,000,000
more than at the previous June. There
have been borrowings since March, the
amount of which will appear later. The big-
gest increases among the exports were in
butter and wheat. Crops were large and the
prices high, and though next year the yield
may be small and the prices low. the luck is
something to be appreciated while it lasts.
Australia was due for at least one record
crop, for the State Governments have lately
spent some 70 or 80 millions of loan money
on the repurchase of land for settlement, and
a great deal more on settlement itself. A
considerable part of this sum is known to be
lost and irrecoverable, and if there wasn’t
some improvement in the cow and wheat
business there would be a fear lest it was all
lost and irrecoverable. The figures show
that, in a season when everything is favor-
able. Australia can do something really big
in those industries where man is, to a great
extent, his own non-unionist employee, and
works as much as he likes for what he can
make. As for the increase in imports,
chiefly of manufactured goods, it suggests
that the tariff is a melancholy dud. Mean-
while, it might be in order for a Royal Com-
mission to inquire if there is any possible or
impossible output of raw materials or cooked
materials, and any possible boom in exports,
which would enable Australia to get through
a year without adding another storey to its
foreign debt. It is a thrilling problem.
Child Pensions.
The Queensland Government has arrived al.
a heroic decision in the matter of child pen-
sions. The idea is to apply to families with
an income of not over £4OO a year, or some-
where in that neighborhood, and consists in
allowing ss. per week for the support of each
child after the first, until it attains the age
of 14. The allowance is to be paid to the
mother, she being less likely to spend it on
beer and horses than the old man. It is a
commendable proposition, especially if tlio
Treasurer knows where to find the necessary
£2,500,000 or so per annum. One scheme is to
put a super-tax on all incomes exceeding £IOOO
per annum. These are pretty much supered
already, for the State is the most heavily
taxed per head in the Commonwealth, and
a decline in the tax yield, in 1921-22 and
again in 1922-23. hinted that, the strain
might be telling. To add £2,500,000 on to
an extortion of £3,600,000 looks serious. An-
other proposal is the famous “levy on capi-
tal,” but to levy once a year would be diffi-
cult ; and Queensland capital is very largely
Victorian. The third inspiration is to make
every employer, in addition to paying the
old 48-hour wage for 44 hours’ work (a loss
of about 8i per cent.) add 5 per cent, to
his wage-sheet and put that into the child-
endowment fund. This faith in the ability
of the omnipotent private employer to hump
any old load is complimentary to him. but
the sugar, dairying and fruit-growing indus-
tries, and Mount Morgan and Cloncurrv
hardly look like carrying much extra just
now, let alone Chillagoe and the Government
cattle-stations. If the State could contrive
to sell its railways to that miracle-working
Private Enterprise in which it puts such
confidence, and thereby cease to lose an
average of £1,200,000 a year by botcliy Min-
isterial control, the financial position would
be brighter. A rumor is abroad that the
Gtlt.tes Cabinet proposes to sell all its eattle-
stations save three, Boiling Downs, Falling
Downs and lying Downs. But it should
really sell every enterprise it has. It is the
kind of concern which couldn’t find a ton
of pure gold without losing money by it.

The Reported Boycott.
“Bildad” : A hurried press gentleman con-
nected with the Victorian half of the United
States Fleet is accused of having cabled
that the welcome consisted in part of boycott
and part personal assault —in fact, he seems
to have made these outstanding features.
If the offender wasn’t the Fleet’s press
gentleman he must have been a realistic imi-
tation. Considering how soon the news
washed back across the Pacific to arouse a
storm of protest here, the report was based
on early impressions. One of these must
have been that local shipping was held up
by a strike organised, with complete im-
punity, by avowed revolutionists of a foreign
brand. That may have created a prejudice
to begin with. Then an early official wel-
come by a thousand or more prominent citi-
zens, which was to have met the visitors
in Hobson's Bay, didn't happen because
certain firemen wouldn’t let the vessel start
unless the Prime Minister presented said
firemen with a humble written apology for
something. This may have been mistaken
for a boycott, especially as the imported and
almost all-powerful head of the sti-ike move-
ment applauded loudly, and some trades-
unions did the same by formal resolution,
and the leader of the Federal Labor party
refused to say anything in condemnation.
As for the Federal Government, it could only
pass off the episode with an uneasy laugh
as a childish ebullition. In the matter of
assault and battery the correspondent may
have taken an over-serious view, but still
almost everybody is assaulted in Melbourne.
In the entire Commonwealth there are be-
tween one-fourth and one-fifth as many
police as in London alone. The Melbourne
force is weak, ill-paid, and more or less de-
moralised since the police strike—also before
the strike. At least one detective has ab-
sconded, and others are in gaol. As for the
Melbourne criminal, he is almost unanimously
at large, either because he wasn’t caught, or
because a harmless J.P. let him out on
straw bail. I seem to recall that some dis-
agreeable character asked a question not long
since in tin- British House of Commons about
the Victorian “crime wave,” meaning that
Victoria wasn't a safe place for British
“migrants” to go to, and I think he got an
indignant answer to the effect that there was
no crime and no wave, and that the proposed
appointment of 100 additional bobbies was
for theological and scientific purposes ex-
clusively. I don't blame that correspondent,
cabling in haste, so much as some people do.
I don’t worry so very much, either, if his
report does “create ill-feeling” at the other
side. If I could only create enough ill-
feeling at this side to diminish the sale
of 11.8. films. I would feel that I hadn’t
lived in vain.
A Holieiizollerii is Heard From.
No monarchical European family has ratted
so consistently on the rest of Europe as the
llohen zollern S. The versatile head of
the household, now reigning in the hearts
of liis countrymen at Ems, Holland, pro-
tended to a regard for the old continent’s
welfare when he had his famous “Yellow
Peril” cartoon executed. Subsequent to that
expression of solicitude for white civilisation,
lie gave the Asiatics an exposition of the
Prussian version of it by seizing Kiao-Ghow
in China, in retaliation for the murder
of two German missionaries by a mob.
Wilhelm next startled Europe by turning
up in Stamboul, just after Abdul had wiped
his knife clean of the gore of an unusually
large mound of murdered Armenians, bor-
rowing the Sultan’s fez. and announcing
himself as the protector of the hundred mil-
lion Moslems throughout the world. This
was not liis first visit, his previous call in
1892 being the first occasion on which a
European monarch had eaten the Caliph’s
salt. He next proceeded to Damascus, where
he laid a wreath on the tomb of Salaoin,
the enemy of Christendom during the Cru-
sades; an action which was too much even
for his docile subjects, who were only quiet-
ened by the display of numerous concessions
on his return. Some of liis other expressions of
solicitude for the unity of the white race in-
clude intruding into an argument between East
and West at Tangier, and between U.S.A. and
Spain in Manila Bay; and since the war
there, has grown up a suspicion that the
alleged disarmament of liis country has been
largely a process of handing the gun over
to Riffs. Turks and Chinamen. Incidentally,
during the war German emissaries spread
throughout Asia the engaging legend that the
Emperor bad been converted to Mohamme-
danism. and was now known as lla.tji Wil-
helm : and the artists of his nation pro-
duced pictures in which Australian white
barbarians, when they weren’t running away
from Turkish bayonets, were engaged in
ravaging the harems of the Faithful. Some
of these works of art penetrated as far as
mountain villages in Java. In the light of
the foregoing facts, the outburst of the ex-
Crown Prince, recently made to an English
press interviewer, is interesting;—
I fear that, unless Europe gets together and be-
comes a strong white race, she will ultimately be
oyer-run by the colored races. 1 think Great Britain
must now realise the mistake of bringing colored
troops to fight against Germany and teaching them
everything about modern warfare. The results are
seen in Morocco, India and everywhere in the East.
Evidently a funny-bone was not included in
the Hohenzollern make-up when the group
was created.
Trade-Stealing and Its Fruits.
Evidence given at the inquiry into the
Traveston (Q.) railway smash suggests that
the insane policy of dragging trade to Bris-
bane along over-taxed lines running parallel
with the coast contributed to the accident.
This is what an assistant maintenance
engineer said: —
The line was built 30 or 40 years ago, when engines
were not nearly as heavy, and when there were only
three or four trains a day. Now there are about
40 trains a day, and the increased traffic is taxing
the road to the utmost.
In the last ten years, just under half a mil-
lion bales of wool were railed from Rock-
hampton to Brisbane, the rate being less
than half that charged to haul wool an equal
distance from western stations to Rockhamp-
ton. Two harbors (Rockhampton and Glad-
stone) were passed en route • both have de-
faulted in their interest payments to the
Treasury. The amount of harbor dues lost
to them by having this lump of their trade
stolen was approximately £12,000. Since
Bowen was connected with the southern rail-
way system the local Harbor Board has like-
wise lost portion of its fruit trade, while
Townsville's wool trade with the back coun-
try is not as safe as it was before the hungry
trains pushed through. Pease, Labor mem
ber for Herbert, stated recently that it re-
quired twice as many ships to carry away
the overseas trade of Brisbane last year as
in 1914. Whereas the value of Brisbane
trade has more than doubled since 1914, that
of Rockhampton, Townsville and Cairns
combined has decreased, and it is liable to
decrease still further as more and more is
charged for sending large ships to three ports
to collect odds and ends of cargo. In 1923 it.
was worth only £1.58 of trade per ton of
shipping to work the three outports: on the
other hand, steamers collected £7.16 worth
per ton at Brisbane, with one lot of harbor
dues to meet. It therefore pays the shipping
companies to let the Queensland citizen foot
a massive bill for concentrating trade on
one port. The inevitable losses are, of course,
made up by dipping into consolidated
revenue, but every trader who can land
goods 6d. per ton cheaper by rail than
he would pay by coastal steamer is led to
believe that the railways are performing a
national function in a spirit of philanthropy.
He therefore assists to white-ant the decen-
tralising, policy laid down by long gone states-
men, who pushed the railways westward from
the coast at four points. Hence, among other
results, over-taxed and inadequate rolling-
stock begins to fall on the hapless traveller
or spill him along the decaying stretch of
permanent-way. Presently, no doubt, there
will be an outsize in loans for the purpose
of duplicating the single line south from
Maryborough. The sensible and honest thing
would be to so revise railway rates that
trade would go to its natural port.

John Higgins’s Scheme.
John Higgins, chairman of Bawra, and
oracle of those who clamor for wool-control,
was invited to formulate a scheme for the
regulation and stabilisation of wool values.
The oracle spoke, and his proposals were not
convincing. Details are subjoined :
Woolgrowers to form themselves into an associa-
tion to acquire and pool wool, said association
to seek power to prohibit the export of wool, except
under its own forms of license.
The association to finance itself to the extent of
£50,000,000 by gradual deductions from the proceeds
of wool sales. Pending the obtaining of sufficient
capital from this source the Commonwealth Govern-
ment to guarantee the pool up to £62,500,000.
Wool to be acquired at a price appraised on a
common all-round basis, to be arrived at by arbitrary
deduction from available information. Disbursements
to subscribers to consist of (a) a first payment 14
days after appraisement (to occur on arrival into
store), (b) a second payment (if any) at the end
of statistical wool year, and (c) a final payment (if
any) when the transactions for any one year’s
are completed. This to be subject to 5 p.c. deduction.
Finance is one of the weak points of a
scheme which is neither original nor clever.
An association without available funds is to
corner a commodity worth anything between
50 and 80 millions in a year. Presumably
the Australian banks would be asked, on
the strength of a questionable Government
guarantee, to finance the purchase of the
wool until the association could induce the
world to take it on the association's terms,
but no bank can be expected to show any
enthusiasm for the cut-and-come-again
method bv which its customers (who are
often its 'mortgagors) are to receive then-
proceeds. The impossibility of getting 80,000
.voolgrowers to come in voluntarily has already
been demonstrated. That means that there
would have to be Governmental restraint of
objectors, an attack on their right as citi-
zens to dispose of their property in their
own way. it is too big a job for any Aus-
tralian Government, except in war-time.
“I’d like to see any man dictate to me about
my wool,” said a Vic. pastoralist, and he
expressed a pretty general feeling. And little
or nothing lias been said as to how _ tin-
wool is to be disposed of when acquired.
Pastoralists are in the dark as to whether if
is to be rationed out to buyers when they
come (if they ever do), whether portion is to
be sold (perhaps for less than the trade is
prepared to pay) and portion held because
the required reserve is too high, or whether
the whole clip is to be auctioned. Auction-
ing would entail the vast expense of a double
operation, and possibly a large proportion
of the wool would be sent overseas for the
purpose, in which case Australian capital
and labor would be denied the right to handle
their own produce. The sale of our wool
is one of Australia’s most highly-developed
and specialised industries. Even London is
admitted by those who know to be inferior
in methods, and other countries are simply
not in the running. It wms because the con-
duct of the Imperial purchase scheme was
mainly placed in the hands of the existing
institution, in which millions of capital has
been invested, very largely by the pastoralists
themselves, that it w*as so conspicuously suc-
cessful. Because of doubts on these and
other points, the Higgins proposals have
found little favor attnong sheepmen. Asso-
ciation after association has, in fact, voted
them down, and it is expected that the
Graziers’ Federal Qouncil will next month
give them the coup tie grace.

Eve in Politics.
P. Airey closes the controversy:—
In reply to “A. de V. M.” (B. 2/7/’25) I desire
to ray that Mr. Airey did not start out “under the
delusion that woman's desire to undertake work
other than domestic is pure cussedness.” I am
well aware that in this modern world there are
numbers of positions outside matrimony for which
many women are well adapted. What I did maintain,
and do still, i; that woman as an active politician is,
in 999 eases out of 1000, misplaced. This is not a
reflection; it may be a compliment. Politics is a
rough game; a coarse game. For every man whom
it improves it debases a dozen, and for this reason
it is a very dubious compliment indeed to tell a
man you think he would “make a good politician.”
For this reason also no lady need feel humiliated if
she be told that the sphere of political life is not
within the ambit of things feminine, and I think
I am quite justified in saying that the majority of
women think so themselves. To take a refined,
educated woman and throw her into the rude
scramble and hurly-burly of legislative life is a
veritable casting of pearls before swine. Let the
Gadarene porkers rush down the steep place into
the sea if they will; rve shall not stay or tone
down the rush by any feminine admixture.
The present writer is far from maintaining that
the male voter has made a brilliant success of
politics so far. Quite the reverse is the case in
many a modern Parliament, and most thinking men
are coming slowly to the conclusion that restriction
of the franchise in the future is more likely to be
the keynote of reform than extension. But know-
ledge, experience, judgment are indispensable for the
successful conduct of government, and in all these
matters the average woman is below the masculine
average. The result is that her sense of balance is
imperfect. She is prone to see the one question ana
the one side of the one question only. Take the
drink problem. To 99 per cent, of women it appears
perfectly clear that you have only to put prohibition
on the statute-book and the drink problem is solved.
But behind the prohibition problem, and involved
therein, is the infinitely greater one of personal
liberty. If women are to legislate beer and tobacco
out of existence, possibly male reformers of similar
mental limitations may institute a violent, campaign
gainst tea-dranuning and the feminine craze for finery.
It may be an exhilarating game to prescribe your
neighbors’ meat and drink by Act of Parliament, but
the pastime has its limits. One waxes weary of this
cant of legislative abolition. When Dr. Johnson
defined patriotism as the last refuge of a scoundrel,
he evidently had not gauged the infinite possibilities
of the word reform.
I notice that my critic is not of those who
would get rid of the social evil by banishing Lais
and Phryne to Tierra del Fuego, and that these
persons are no longer “objects of mystery and
vague loathing.” If this means that respectable
womanhood does not regard the frail sisterhood with
dislike and contempt, then general observation does
not bear out the assertion. The moment the average
woman of decent repute fails to draw aside her skirts
or elevate her delicate nostrils in scorn 1 when
Aspasia passes on the prowl, 1 am quite prepared to
accept that statement as correct. Eve may have a
few daughters who take a broader view, but they
are few indeed.
The proof that men to-day are not opposed to
equitable legislation where woman is concerned is
patent to anyone. Tlae very existence of adult suffrage
throughout Australia is evidence all-sufficient. The
moment woman demands insistently a defensible
change in the law, she is bound to get it. That
“A. de V. M.” knows a few women of the sort whose
vote is not a duplication of the husband’s, father’s or
lover’s proves nothing. The fact of the general
duplication is notorious. Not a particle of evidence
has been adduced in support of the contention that the
advent of Eve into politics is going to lift up and
regenerate political life and, later, mankind. The
replies printed consist mainly in asserting that the
present writer wants to pin all women down to a
painful domesticity. But that would be a pure
futility. He or she who has the talents will always
find a use for them, and there is abundance of
opportunity for read talent outside the grimy field
of politics. Woman and politics are better apart.
After all, what is the political field as things are
nowadays ? The mere passing paradise of pugnacious
mediocrity.

“Stellsby” : Thus Melbourne Age, on the
anniversary of the declaration of w T ar:—
All the tragedy and heartbreak are behind us, and
we can look back to them with a calmness which we
thought impossible a few years ago.
Rubbish like that makes me spit blood. I
am one of a number of British ex-service
men in Australia drawing war pensions, and
one of perhaps a few mindful of the fact
that early in 1926 all pensions, unless public
opinion prove too strong, will be reduced
by 10 per cent. Winston Churchill,
Chancellor of the Exchequer, according to
an English report, has already intimated that
he expects to save the British taxpayer
several millions annually by pension-cutting.
Should this be done, numbers of totally in-
capacitated men will be deprived of the right
to live in the remotest semblance of comfort,
while the Canadian farmer who happens to
be a great-great-great-grandson of Admiral
Rodney, who probably never shed a drop
of sweat more than I did in his country’s de-
fence, is in January to receive a commuted
ancestral pension of £42,000 for work per-
formed by a man who died over a century
ago. Also coal-miners are given bounties to
keep them from striking, and the unemployed
in general are handed the demoralising dole.
ANOMALIES.
“Replying to criticism of the statutory 44-hour working week, Queensland Premier Gillies said he
was quite prepared to admit that at the outset it would cause anomalies.”
UNEMPLOYED LEADER ( beginning his speech) : “Feller-anomalies!”
By virtue of the royal warrant of 1919 the
Imperial Government is invested with the
power to reduce war pensions as from April
1 next. I personally am in receipt of a 100
per cent. British war pension. It is little
enough, God knows, but if the 10 per cent,
reduction is enforced next year I shall, if
I am above the sod, find it inadequate as a
means of livelihood. And there are many
British war pensioners in Australia in a
far worse plight than mine.

“Hopalong” : “Paradise” is only guessing
when he states (B. 23/7/’25) that a man
can receive 15 weeks’ sustenance under the
Queensland Unemployed Insurance Act on a
card with sixpence in stamps on it. The
Act only allows a man to draw sustenance
for a period equal to half the time he was
in employment and contributing to the fund,
with a maximum of 90 days in any one
calendar year. “Paradise’s” laborer would
be entitled to draw one week's sustenance on
the two threepenny stamps on his card, after
having been registered at a State Labor
Exchange for 14 days. Rates of sustenance
vary in the different industrial divisions: a
single man would receive in the southern divi-
sion 155., in the central division 16s. 3d., and
in the northern division 17s. 6d. per week.
I take it that “Paradise’s” worker is in
the southern division ; if so, he would be en-
titled to 15s. for himself, 10s. for his wife
and 4s. for his one child, a total of 295. (not
355.) per week. One of the greatest dis-
advantages of the Act, apart from its degrad-
ing influence on the workers, is the oppor-
tunities it opens up for fraud. A space is
provided on the back of each unemployment
insurance-book for the employer’s name (not
signature), the period of employment and
the amount paid in wages. There is nothing
to prevent any impostor from stamping up
his own card, endorsing the name of a mythi-
cal employer on the back and bowling up to
the nearest Labor Agency for his 15 weeks’
sustenance. When he has cut out the 15
weeks he can “jump the rattler” to some
other town and repeat the joke there. The
chance of punishment is slight, because it is
impossible to verify even a small percentage
of the claims.
“Forebridge,” in explanation :
So much has been written in the daily press
of the marvellous electrical machinery in the Ameri-
can warships that the uninitiated must wonder why the
British Navy is so backward in comparison. The
fact is that, speaking generally, electrical machinery
is out of date in the R.N. As long ago as 1910 the
British battle-cruiser Invincible was fitted with
electrical training gear for her turrets, but exhaustive
experiments proved that this type of machinery was
neither as reliable nor as effective as hydraulic
training mechanism. Breakdowns were frequent, and
it was found impossible to obtain that uniformity of
motion in training the turret which is so essential
to good shooting. The electrical gear, when it did
work, was far too jerky, and the whole installation
proved too delicate and fragile for the work in hand.
On the outbreak of war, the Admiralty lost no time
in replacing the electrical turret-training mechanism
with hydraulic macninery, and since then no ships
of the Royal Navy have been fitted with any but
hydraulic turret machinery. It must be conceded
that electrical machines have improved considerably
of recent years, but the opinion largely held by
British naval experts even to-day is that electricity
is neither a safe nor an efficient medium of power in
a warship. Electrical gear is too susceptible to
derangement by salt-water, hard usage and external
shocks. Hydraulic machinery, on the other hand,
is practically impervious to harsh treatment, and
only actual severance of a pipe will seriously damage
it. It is also easily controlled, and will allow of
the most delicate adjustments. However, it is in-
correct to imply that the Americans have a mono-
poly of electrical auxiliary machinery. A Sydney
Morning Herald writer says: “Steam winches are
used on British ships when manual work is not
relied upon for launching boats, but it is an object-
lesson to see an American bluejacket on the platform
of an electrical derrick, operating with one finger
the control which lets down a huge launch capable of
holding 100 liberty men.” Steam winches have not
been employed for such work in the British Navy, for
more than 20 years. Twelve years ago I com-
missioned a British county-class cruiser—herself 10
years old at the time —and she was fitted with boat-
hoist gear almost identical with that which arouses
the enthusiasm of the S.M.H. man. In her ease, though,
the machinery was more powerful, for it could lift an
18-ton picket-boat off the booms and deposit it in
the water alongside. The truth is that although
electrical potato-peelers and dish-washers may be
ornamental, and even useful, electrical boat-hoists,
turret training-machines and, above all, main
engines are. considered by most British naval special-
ists to be merely dangerous.

“N.K.C.” : Brunswick (Vic.) is protesting
against the establishment of a home for the
mentally deficient at Royal Park, an insti-
tution that is absolutely necessary in \ ie-
toria, although there is some force in the
objection that the proposed site is unsuitable.
In these matters the Commonwealth could
learn much from the U.S. America has its
huge Vineland Colony, a collection of cottage
homes with a nucleus of research laboratories
and an industrial school. Here, feeble-minded
children live a dozen to a cottage, with a
cottage mother, and those who can learn to
read and write, while everyone is taught
some trade. The colony is practically self-
supporting, with its own farm, its dress-
making, bootmaking and carpentery establish-
ments. The inmates are graded by their
“mental age”; a boy of 20 may have the
intelligence of a normal child of six years.
All work according to their capacity, and
concerts, movies and visiting days make life
as pleasant as it can be made for deficients.
In Victoria wc have Kew, but it fails to cater
for the moron, that type of “other-minded
child” who is nearly normal blit lacks that
something which makes for sanity. There
is the Bell-street special -school, but this is
only a day-school, cramped in a crowded
suburb, from which the children go when
they reach 16 years. Its good work touches
only the fringe of the problem.
♦
“Caractacus” : The U.S. Navy excites
admiration by its adaptation of its excel-
lently-equipped sea-fighting machine to in-
dustrial needs. Its youthful seamen are
each taught a skilled trade. Unlike the
time-expired R.N. or R.A.N. man, they may
look forward to something much better
than a job as bricklayer’s mate, fireman
or plain laborer: the gob has, in effect,
put in an extra four years at a technical
school, and emerges that much better edu-
cated. Apart from the fine moral advantage
that goes with self-reliance, the U.S. gains
through having turned out of its ship-fac-
tories each year several thousand eager young
fellows all charged with the rudiments of
seamanship and war-lore. There is a lesson
here for us. Australia has a fine ground-
work in its naval-cadet system. If it could
make the R.A.N. a national' technical
school it would take a long step upon the
path towards solving both its naval-recruit-
ing and apprenticeship problems.

“E. J.H.” : Apropos the Red Page article (B.
23/7/’25) on the revolting cruelties of vivi-
sectors, I should like to present these two
points for consideration: (1) We have no
law —in N. S. Wales, at any rate —dealing
with vivisection ; therefore the helpless ani-
mals have not even the sorry protection
afforded by the English law, which provides
for the issue of licenses to vivisectors and
the keeping of records of experiments. (2)
Vivisection is part of the training of our
doctors, and from that it follows that, even
though the practice here is not yet wide-
spread, it is only because we have so little
endowed research. While the point of view
of that section of the medical profession
which is in place and power remains un-
changed, we only need endowed laboratories
and salaried research workers to enable us
to produce a crop of horrors of our own.
♦
David Stewart writes :
The author of “Uplift” (B. 30/7/’2 5) has evidently
attached my name to views advanced by some other
speaker at a conference organised by my association.
It is grotesquely untrue to say that I regard the
N.S.W. University as “an institution financed and
controlled by the capitalistic classes.” My principal
work for the past 12 years as secretary of the
Workers’ Educational Association has been an en-
deavor to bridge the gulf between wage-workers
and the University. I think I can claim to have
been of some service to the University in that respect.

“7P.N.”: A feature of the expiration of
Queensland pastoral leases is the neglected
condition into which many of the properties
are being suffered to fall. Dams aue becom-
ing silted up, fences are falling to pieces,
water-raising equipment is in deterioration,
Bathurst burr and other noxious weeds are
in riotous evidence. Gillies and co. had
plenty of opportunities of preventing' the
evil situation that is ruling in Queensland
to-day, but they elected not to take hold
of a land settlement difficulty before the
spikes started to grow on it.

POLITICAL
POINTS
An instance of “land hunger” transpired
at Grafton (N.S.W.) when three Govern-
ment homestead farms were thrown open,
and 2230 applicants took a gratis ticket in
the gamble. Their ages ranged from 16 to
about 70, and they were of almost every
occupation, save that of diver and profes-
sional Arctic explorer. A lease for eternity,
at a rent of 21 per cent, of the value and
with elastic conditions, which may include
postponement of rent for five years and occu-
pation by deputy or absentee, is better than
a horse in Tatt.’s. The horse may never
start, but the lease runs for ever.
Following on the Westralian Labor agita-
tion for the release of Callahan, the Golden
Mile Communist who got seven years in 1923
for robbery under arms, another sturdy revo-
lutionary, whose name and whereabouts are
at present unknown, stuck up a motor-
tricycle on the Manjimup-Pemberton rail-
way, shot a bank manager in the hand, and
got away with £1985, the fortnightly earn-
ings of Government sawmill hands. The
rebel against State capitalism has been
angrily stigmatised as a bushranger. Yet he
is obviously what Callahan called himself, an
exponent of “propaganda by deed.”
Soundings are being taken as to the
chances of eight or nine ex-legislators for
the Senatorship rendered vacant by the death
of Ted Russell (Vic.). If the Cockies put
up Pickering, president of their organisa-
tion, he will have a much better chance than
White, who ran last year, especially if he has
to fight it out with Plain, of theN.F. As in Tas-
mania recently, Labor may not nominate a
man of its own, but the ?A votes it can com-
mand at the joint sitting of the two Houses
will all be cast-against ex-comrade Plain.
If Pickering has to meet Donald Mackinnon
or Hugh McKenzie in the last lap, he may
not fare so well. Others who have been
feeling pulses are Boyd, Leckie and Mc-
Gregor (Libs.), and Hall (Agrarian), former
members of Vic. Assembly.
The Queensland Government intends to sell
two more of its cattle-stations (reducing the
number to 12) if “a satisfactory price” is
offered. On the basis of present management
the only reasonable price would be less than
nothing, for a perpetual loss isn’t saleable,
but the Government evidently realises that
it is an outsize in the way of in-
capables. Australian Governments took
to building railways because railways
were wanted and weren’t there. It
was the same with schools, harbor im-
provements and the like. But in many re-
cent “socialistic” undertakings it was a case
of pushing out private experts who supplied
a want well enough, to make room for poli-
tical amateurs who supplied it badly. There
was little extra employment as a result. The
State lost the rent and taxes that private-
enterprisers would have paid. It lost shock-
ing amounts of money. It lost its business
reputation—but then it never had much.
And now the time seems ripe to sell off, and
wind up, and lose all recollection of the ex-
periment.
So poor a brand of Australianism has been
exhibited by representatives of the alleged
moving-picture “industry” in their appear-
ances before the Tariff Board that the Gov-
ernment, when overhauling the tariff, should
raise the film duty from 1-kl. to Is. per foot,
if only with the hope of improving the said
brand. Also, it cannot ignore the assertions
of 11. D. Mclntosh as to the dodging of taxa-
tion on the profits of foreign films shown in
Australia, or the explicit statements of 11. S.
Musgrove:—
In 1922 lie entered into a contract with an Ameri-
can concern to take one film a week at an average
cost of £lOOO. In 18 months he sent the American
co. £150,000. When he had established the busi-
ness on a sound footing, the American firm increased
the price of its films, and he was unable to carry on
the business. On the £150,000 which he had sent
from Australia, no tax was paid by Americans.
At least £100,060 of that £150,000 should
have been clear profit. An Australian who
earned £lOO,OOO clear in 1922-23 would have

Accepting a recommendation made by Pitt,
Under-Treasurer, Vic. Cabinet is appointing
a committee to manage a wheat-growing
stimulation fund. The money is being found,
involuntarily, by the growers themselves.
Under the Compulsory Wheat Pool Act in
operation during the war years, and for some
time afterwards, provision was made for
money not claimed or likely to be claimed to
be paid into a separate account. At present
£2500 is in hand, and £7OOO more is expected
soon. In addition, it is hoped to get £75.000
of interest from Roumania, which bought
Australian wheat after the German occupa-
tion and paid in Micawber’s fashion. As
Pitt was manager of the Australian Wheat
Board and was thus able to inform himself
authoritatively as permanent head of the
Treasury, the Cabinet felt safe in accepting
his advice, though there are people who don t
share its optimism regarding the Roumanian
money.
An old State difficulty has been revived by
the south-eastern district of S.A., which has
always felt its isolation from Adelaide. To
Melbourne lately went a deputation, headed
by Hay, Mayor of Mount Gambier, with a
petition for road-making and an incidental
suggestion that Victoria might well take
over the whole district. In the old days,
the south-east communicated with Adelaide
almost entirely by sea. There is now a
break-of-gauge branch from the inter-State
line; but a broad-gauge line through Port-
land connects with Melbourne without any
extra handling of goods. The great expanse
of mallee country, formerly known as the
90-mile desert, but now to some extent occu-
pied, has been a bar to road-making from
Adelaide, and the way through the Coorong,
difficult at times though steadily being im-
proved, is the only thoroughfare, whereas
roads to Melbourne are many and easy. Hay
reminded Goudie, the Vic. Public Works Minis -
ter, that the Mount Gambier district was first
discovered by Vic., and claimed that the great
majority of its interests are Victorian still.
“It is entirely cut off from its own State,”
he protested. Goudie replied, after the
manner of politicians, that he would see what
could be done.
The opening of the State Parliament at
Perth found Westralian politicians ready to
take anything at their neighbors’ expense,
the same as ever. Opposition-leader Mitchell
said that the people of W.A. paid for local
development work (the same as other States),
and thereby improved the Federal revenue
(which is possible with any State). Where-
fore, according to Jimmy, the Commonwealth
should hand over to his State three-fourths
of the local customs and excise revenue
(making up the loss at the general charge
of all the Federal partners). Then, said
James, his burdened land could reduce its
taxation “to the same level as in other
States.” For the last ten years for which
the “Official Year Book” supplies details
Westralian taxes have always been below
the average, and generally a long way below.
But politicians of the Mitchell sort are
too busy whining among the ruins of their
dud settlement schemes to read the “Official
Year Book.” „
Melbourne ’Varsity Council has sanctioned
the formation of students’ Labor and Liberal
clubs, but jibbed at affiliation with outside
bodies. The question of affiliation was raised
by an application from the Labor section
to be associated with the A.L.P. .Tones,
Lemmon and E. S. Eoss, the Laborites on
the council, argued that there should.be no
tag to the permissive resolution. One or
two councillors were for waiting and seeing
—it would be time enough to put up a fence,
said Cussen, ,T., if bounds were disregarded.
But Latham, M.H.E., spoke strongly for the
tag, and the majority sided with him. The
voting was 11 to 7.
Gillies, the Queensland Labor Premier,
admitted the other day that the introduction
of the 44-hour working week had “caused
anomalies,” and further “anomalies” are ex-
pected to result from the Labor child-
endowment scheme. For instance, the Gov-
ernment has numerous colored citizens in
the Straits and elsewhere. Although many
of these (where living on reserves) are under
the Aboriginal Department, hundreds carry
much South Sea and other blood, and for
the purposes of the Marriage Act and legis-
lation relative to fisheries have to be treated
practically as whites. Unless specially
exempted these coons will come under the
child-endowment scheme, and as they never
require much stimulus in maintaining the
birth-rate they are likely to look out for full
privileges. Even the Torres Strait islanders
of pure blood may be entitled to the five bob
a week per infant, after the first. A political
party bent on extracting millions from its
opponents and distributing them among its
supporters always finds it difficult to dis-
criminate.
Our American cousin lias a great name
for energy and efficiency in private enter-
prise, where he believes in payment by
results. In national management he falls'
rather flat, which is probably due in great
part to the temporary feeling created by
the shifting of office-holders every time a
new crowd comes in. The U.S. war record
was an instance. As the great struggle
toddled along there were certain- increases
in the public debt, due in part to the lend
ing of money on profitable terms to the
combatants. Then the republic waded in
personally, and got some 3000 million pounds
in debt in one year, and had little to show
save an enormous mob of men whom it
did not know how to train or shift across
the sea. But for expert foreign guidance
the Old Man at Washington would hardly
have got into the war till years after it
was over, and by that time his liability
would have been super-horrible.
“X2X”: It is unlikely that Victoria’s
new drug bill, directed at restriction of the
traffic in narcotics, will go very far in check-
ing the dope evil. The measure largely con-
sists of safeguards and regulations against
the disposal of forbidden narcotics by chem-
ists, and imposes penalties for the obtaining of
such drugs by false pretences. But the part
which the chemist plays in the narcotic traffic
is a negligible one; the bulk of the stuff is
smuggled into the Commonwealth, and is
handled and distributed by gentry in the
bootlegging line. What is really needed is
a Federal measure making it an offence
punishable by gaol without the option for
any person to have narcotics in liis or her
possession without proper authority.
“Eetired Tenant” writes :
It is understood that the N.S.W. Government will
enter on another robust struggle with the Sydney
house-shortage problem, though the last struggle wjas
a very unsatisfactory and unpayable affair, especially
out Gladesville way. There is also talk of further
discouraging the landlord by adding another storey
to the Bare Rents law. It costs a great deal in
day labor to build a house nowadays—-in fact it is
said to cost so much that the man who constructs, a
cottage often couldn’t afford to occupy it himself.
Then what is regarded as a fair maximum rent leaves
a very poor margin for absconding tenants, for un
financial tenants who lack the grace to abscond, foi
destructive tenants, and for periods of slump such
as that which happened in the nineties of last century
and which will happen again when the loan boom
strikes a rock. Then rates go out and rents don’t
come in, and the terrace becomes a sort of cannibal
eating up its owner. There was once a species of
person who loved to own rows of houses so that lie
might gloat over them, and who found genuine hap-
piness in collecting rents on Monday morning. He
is now r very rare, partly because the Government has
borrowed all his money on liberal terms and built
insolvent railways with it, and partly for other
reasons. A great many capitalists would as soon
have property with borersin it as property with
tenants. A good deal may be said for the system
whereby rates are charged to the tenant. Rents,
of course, are lower then, and in some cases the
rates are equal to the rent. When the house is
empty it pays no rates, which removes one danger
of landlordism. This method is understood to give
the tenant an active interest in municipal government,
and it gives the municipal authority some active
exercise in trying to collect a little money to go on
with. Also it enables the municipal councillor to
share with the landlord the obloquy of putting in
the bailiff.
THE DREAM LIMIT.
[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
“The official negotiations between the Finance Min-
istry of France and the British Treasury about the
war debt have again broken down.”
1 fell asleep and dreamed the sun was setting in the
east;
That all our politicians unexpectedly had ceased
To call each other knaves and worse in passionate
harangues;
That Denny fell on Harwell's neck and Fuller upon
Lang’s.
I dreamed that Johnson (Pussyfoot) had been at last
induced
To try a nip of smuggled rum before he went to
roost;
That wool was up to three-and-nine, ’mid joyous
celebrations
From shepherd-kings —and Abdul Krim had joined the
League of Nations.
I dreamed the girls were wearing skirts a foot below
the knees;
That Bruce appeared in blucher boots and ereaseless
dungarees;
That England from her tennis hordes had rooted out
a man
To take the mighty Tilden down, a maid to whack
Suzanne.
I dreamed that Bolshies ceased to plan the world to
overthrow ;
That Mussolini wore a shirt as white as driven snow;
That Oscar Asche the Channel swam, without beef-
tea or brandy,
And subsequently made a bet he’d fast as long as
Ghandi.
I dreamed the aggravating sun was rising in the west l .,-
They'd licensed pubs at both the Boles and top of
Everest.
I dreamed that Trotsky sang a hymn, and Coolidge
hissed a curse,
And poet-laureate Bridges wrote a line or - two of
verse.
I woke and groaned in bitterness and turned me to
the wall,
Then fell asleep again and dreamed the maddest
thing of all.
The most grotesque, preposterous, fantastic vision yet,
That France was paying patient Bull a trifle off The
Debt!

“Nakhoda” :“A nice home town’’ w T as one
of the descriptions applied to Sydney by an
appreciative gob. Is it any wonder it struck
him that way? Our policemen are Irish,
and already we have the makings (if no
more) of an efficient Tammany Hall. Our
chief amusement is American movies; our
theatres are dedicated to American jazz
comedies, we have sundae shops, Sunday
newspapers, radio, business colleges and the
Rotary Club—all American products. Our
citizens spend their week-ends seeing how
far they can get into the country in Ameri-
can cars on American oil, and our young
people are learning to speak the American
language. The heroes of American fiction are
their heroes, and the heroines of the Ameri-
can screen are their heroines. They are more
familiar with the horsemanship of Tom Mix
than with the poetry or horsemanship of
Adam Lindsay Gordon. Anna Q. Nilsson is
a living thing to them, and the late Rose
Scott isn’t. Lots of them probably know

(B. 6/8/’25), we were spending the even-

someone noticed a Morse lamp flashing from

be interesting to know what was being said
reminded someone that Mr. Brown, a retired
merchant of wowserish inclinations, could
read the signals, and he was hurriedly
dragged from a fireside talk to exhibit his
proficiency. In company with several elderly
ladies he proceeded to the balcony, where
in a booming voice he began to spell. “G,”
he read, “O-T,” pause, “O-H-E,” pause
(“That’s no sense,” remarked one old lady),
“LL” concluded Mr. Brown, triumphantly.
And the collection of old ladies, who had
thought they were about to listen to cabinet
secrets or plans for naval manoeuvres, faded
gently inside, convinced that Mr. Brown was
not a nice person to cultivate.

“Percy Pawnticket”: The adventurous
Australian kid stepped well into the limelight
during the Fleet visit. Three Petersham
(Sydney) youngsters, two of them five and
one only three, set out to see the warships
in the morning, and were missing at mid-
night ; but two of them, although they had
to walk it, did see the Fleet, and had a good
day, anyway. The Melbourne limit was
more freakish. A gang of youngsters, get-
ting a glimpse of a spread on which the offi-
cers intended to regale their guests, clam-
bered in through a porthole and helped them-
selves. They made a good job of it; but just
as the marauders had finished they were
discovered, and one was caught—possibly he
was too swollen in the waistline to nego-
tiate the opening by which he entered. How-
ever, nothing much happened to him except
the dollar which one of his “indignant cap-
tors” slipped into his hands before telling
him to “Get fer your life.” It may have been
the lonely captive’s sturdy refusal to give
away his mates that appealed.

“Elsie Ghee”: One of the surprises of the
Fleet visit was the visitors’ accent. Either
the ships are re-
cuited largely from
parts other than
New England and
south of Mason
and Dixon’s line, or
our preconceptions
of nasalism are
wrong. After ex-
perience of hun-
dreds of American
voices, those of
wardroom as well
as lower-deck, the
verdict must be
that the expected
sing-song was as
infrequent as the
expected chewing of
gum. American-
English diff e r s
most from Austra-
lian-English in a
broadening of the
short “o” sound
into something like

ening and thicken-
ing of the difficult,

“Schnorrer”The growth of Zionism
amongst the Jews of Australia was shown by
the observance last month of the “Yalirzeit
of Herzl, founder of the Zionist movement,
by the Sydney community. A “Yalirzeit” is
the observance of the anniversary of a death,
which every good Jew keeps for his departed
parents, and which Jews generally keep for
the great figures of the race. Rabbi F. L.
Cohen, the chief minister of the Jewish com-
munity, was absent, however, his lack of
enthusiasm regarding Zionism being well
known. Recently the two Jewish papers
published in Sydney have clashed upon the
Zionist question, the Hebrew Standard de-
claring that it is disloyal for a Jew living
under the British flag to encourage a racial
patriotism for a “National Home” in Pales-
tine, whilst the Australian Jewish
Chronicle hotly retorts that the disloyalty
lies with those Jews who refuse to give their
support to Britain’s own scheme for the
settlement of the “Jewish problem.” The
argument is likely to become warmer later
on.

“Gan”: Wasn’t Madame Blavatsky’s
“broken English” (B. ‘lO/7/25) rathei
broken Irish? At any rate, even if her doc-
trines came from the Tenth Sphere, she her-
self was of the soil, with a lot of horse-sense
and humor. An ex-disciple told me this
one. A frail young beauty had joined the
circle, but she fascinated so many men and
collected so many lovers that her amorous
affairs interfered with the higher thought.
At last Madame was asked to talk seriously
to the fair one. “It won’t do, my dear, she
said through her haze of cigarette smoke
“you mustn’t have so many lovers. You n
have to be satisfied with one.”

“Wanchai”: “X2X” tells of several
thirsty members of a Sydney stevedore s
gang who drank about three-quarters ot a
pint of “sam-shui” apiece; my experience is
that there are few, if any, beverages more
potent. The Chinese drink it from vessels
not much bigver than thimbles. I remember
a native merchant with whom I was dining
at a Chinese hotel in West Point (Hong
Ivong) cautioning me to go gently with the
liaueur-glass of sam-shui, and the suffocating
sensation which followed the first sip satis-
fied me that the warning was justified. But
a Cantonese maiden seated on my knee —this
was customary. I learned, after my first dis-
play of embarrassment —refilled the glass.
My host informed me that “sam-shui meant
“dew-of-the-roses,” a fine example of the
poetry of Chinese nomenclature.

“Geographer”: Very shortly a cairn will
mark the exact spot on the Queensland coast
where Captain Cook landed and formally
took possession of that portion of Australia
on behalf of Britain. Dr. Cumbrac Stewart,
Registrar of the Queensland University,
backed by a strong Bundaberg committee, is
raking in the funds necessary. Mr. Haly,
manager of the Bundaberg branch of the
Commercial Bank of Sydney and an enthusi-
ast in Australian history, recently took a
party to Bustard Head, between Bundaberg
and ‘Gladstone, and marked out the site for
the cairn. It is about 100 yards back from
the beach on an eminence from which it will
be visible to ships passing up and down the
coast, and may be used as a lead by small
craft entering Bustard Bay. Strange how
Cook managed to drop in near to good har-
bors without running right into them. At
Bustard Head he was only a few miles south
of Port Curtis, one of the best harbors on
the coast —and one of the least used. It
does not appear that Cook ever found Port
Curtis, any more than he found Port Jack
son.
“M.H.”: Meet illuminations may impress
the multitude, but the best pyrotechnics I
have ever seen
were the displays
which were once
given yearly in the
■little Chinese vil
lages near the tin-
mines of Tasmania.
The occasion was
the Pongs’ annual
festival, when every
hut was placarded
with red posters
to keep out the
evil spirits. I have
never seen cracker.,
like those fashion-
ed in the country
whi c h first dis
covered the use of
gunpowder. In one
village there was a
quarter-caste who
acted as interpre-
ter in tin transac-
tions with the local
buyers. Suspicion
all on him, and at
the next festival
fireworks were
secreted in his
clothes. When
furtive match was
applied later on in
the evening, a liv-
ing catherine-wheel
supplied the thrill
of the festival. He
was badly burnt,
of course, but pre-
sumably honor was regarded as satisfied.

“Nikko”: The old nautical prejudice
against sailing with a corpse may be dying
out, but ocacsionally something happens to
revive it. Some years ago the Chinese
population of Auckland spent weeks dis-
interring their deceased friends and rela-
tions from the Waikumete Cemetery, and
the steamer Ventnor was chartered to
carry the coffins to China for burial. There
does not seem to have been any trouble h<
obtaining a crew, and with some hundreds
of bodies aboard the steamer set off on her
trip. Some distance from the MX. coast
the vessel sprang a leak, and after the crew
had hurriedly taken to the boats she filled
and plunged with her gruesome freight to tb
bottom. There was much wailing and agi-
tation in M.L. in the intervals between far
tan and pak-a-pu, but as nothing could
be done, John philosophically went on wit!:

THE WOMAN OF FEW WORDS.
[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
“Shortly after the marriage his wife cleared home

times. She greeted him on one occasion when he
went to induce her to return to him, with: ‘Hullo!
Tea’s ready!’ She was a woman of few words.’’

He went to win her back, a surge and eddy
Of pleading eloquence upon his lips.
She said “Hullo!” in even tones and steady

And placidly observed that tea was ready.
Some women might have added “fish and chips.”
hot she, one of those beings rare who hold
That reticence is gold.
He went to win her back if he were able ;
Held out forgiving arms, mayhap, to her.
She froze his ardor up and dammed the babel
Of tenderness designed her heart to stir
By mentioning a meal was on the table,
Leaving him, one imagines, to infer
There waited, if he felt in stoking trim,
A knife and fork for him.
He went to win her back, that wanderer chronic,
That errant bird from the domestic coop.
She struck no pose remotely histrionic,
She didn’t spurn him, and she didn’t stoop
To ask his pardon. Her remark laconic
Showed more consideration for the soup.
At all events, it seemed to indicate
He might, that couldn’t wait.
He went to win her back, mayhap repeating,
The while he went, many an insistent plea.
It should have been a sentimental meeting,
Dramatic, too —but how could he foresee
She’d spike his guns with that prosaic greeting.
That simple statement “Just in time for tea.”
A woman of few words! He could, T guess,
Have done with even less.

“C.”: Hugh Wright’s article on Mudie’s
“Felonry of New South Wales” (B.
9/7/’25) reminds me of the old story that
John Robertson, when Premier, ordered the
complete destruction of every copy of a list,
printed in folio, of the names of persons
transported to Port Jackson, their offences
and other legal details, which had been com-
piled by some former Premier for the pur-
pose of separating the pure from the cross-
bred merinos. One copy of this record, it
Avas alleged, had been sent to every police
district in N.S.W., Port Phillip and More-
ton Bay. But, between then and Robert-
son’s time, Port Phillip and Moreton Bay
had become the centres of States quite out-
side Ma’s control. The inference is that
in Brisbane and in Melbourne this convict
record is among the archives, but not in
Sydney. Is it so, or must another bubble
he burst?
* * # #
“G.D.M.” recalls a pioneer:—
In a newspaper published at Lima, Peru, is an
article “How Hargraves Found the Gold,” by T. A.
Rickard, editor of a mining journal in San Francisco.
Hargraves Avas born at Gosport, England, in 1810.
At 14 he went to sea for three years, and at 17 he
settled in N.S.W. He engaged in pastoral pursuits,
but struck bad times in the disastrous early ’forties
and lost his station. At 39 years of age he sailed
for ’Frisco and made for the alluvial diggings. It
soon struck him that 18 years previously he had
travelled through similar country in N.S.W.—the
same rocks, slates, granite, red soil and so forth.
In March, 1850, he wrote a friend in Sydney that
lie knew of likely gold country within 300 miles of
Sydney. Eight months later he sailed for Sydney, and
in February, 1851, set out on horseback across the
■blue Mountains for Bathurst. Reaching Gulgong, he
found quarters at an inn kept by a Mrs. Lister, and
took the landlady’s son down Lewis Ponds Creek,
STRICTLY HONEST.
“I told him he was a brute, and returned all his beastly presents.”
“And what did the tor wretch do?”
“Sent me a dosen boxes of face-powder in return for what he
had taken home on his coat!”
which flows into the Macquarie River. After
travelling 15 miles they reached one of the spots
he had visualised, and with pick and trowel Hargraves
dug a panful of earth, washed it in a waterhole and
found a little piece of gold. Five more panfuls were
tried and gold panned off in four of them. Har-
graves reported his find in writing to the Colonial
Secretary, E. Deas Thomson, and showed the gold
to that official in Sydney. He asked for a bonus
of £5OO on condition he showed Government officers
the places where he found the gold, leaving the
question of further reward for future determination.
Later on he was awarded £lO,OOO. Hargraves made
no effort to peg any claims for himself, stating he
preferred to rely on the Government and the country
for his reAvard.
• • * *
“Harold Hardupp”: A recent petitioner in
the Melbourne Divorce Court is dead against
the practice of moving houses. While work-
ing on a contract
in the country he
received some news
which caused him
to send his wife an
abrupt intimation
that she would
have to get rid of
the boarder she had
taken in, and that
if he wasn’t gone
by the time he re-
turned to the city
h e vVould throAV
both of them out
bodily. His wife
made no reply, and
a fortnight later,
when the contrac-
tor arrived at what
should have been
home, he found no-
thing but a block
of bare land with
the front fence
down, heavy Avheel-
marks on the lawn,
the brick piers on
which the cottage
had rested and a
ruined vegetable
garden. Although
many people had
seen the cottage
being carted aAvay,
no one knew where
it had gone, and its
owner’s attempts
to trace it have
been in vain. It
must be the only
instance upon record in which a man not
only eloped with another man’s wife, but
with the house that contained her as well.
* * * *
“Sleuth”: The English business encyclo-
paedia which announces the completion of the
Australian North-South railway (B.
80/7/’25) has an ally in another fortnightly
published from the same house. An issue
of “Countries of the World” gives some in-
teresting “facts” about Australia from the
pen of none other than Sir W. Beach
Thomas. From it I glean that the Darling
Downs are in N. S. Wales, that a Queens-
land train is called the “Turkey Express”
because the engine-drivers stop to shoot wild
turkeys, and that mice , plagues are frequent
and fearful, the rodents sometimes devouring
the entire contents of houses, including bed-
ding, carpets and furniture. That’s enough
for one issue.
* * * *
“Flicker”: “R.N.W.” (B. 30/7/’25) must
be hard to convince if the “communication
from the S.A. Registrar-General” does not
suggest to him that the S.A. Act would not
sanction an open-air, long-distance marriage,
such as that attri-
buted to Father
Woods. True, the
Act does not say a
building; it says
the building “men-
tion e d in the
license authorising
the marriage”; but
it is absurd to pre-
tend that a tree
could come in
either category. As
for the marriage on
the Murray which
“R.N.W.” denoun-
ces as a flight of
fancy, the sceptical
person need only
write a second
letter to the S.A.
Registrar - General
to satisfy himself
that in 1922 the
incident happened.
The fact that Mur-
ray steamers used
to travel “eight or
ten knots an hour”
is interesting but
irrelevant. The
point is that a
couple were mar-
ried on a Murray
steamer by special
permission of the Registrar-General, a con-
dition precedent being that the steamer must
be made fast to the bank during the cere-
mony.

“ Jorkins”: No one is so intolerant of igno-
rance or technical errors as the flag-expert
(B. 00/7/’25). At Bathurst during the war
a prominently-displayed Union Jack was half-
masted whenever casualty lists announced
that a Digger from the district had gone
west. On one such occasion I was halted
by a stranger, whose rolling gait suggested
a retired admiral, and his terra-cotta
complexion a colonel on furlough from India.
Fie glared fiercely at the half-masted ensign,
and demanded to know who was responsible. I
suggested he should apply for information to
the ToAvn Hall. He left “to inform the lgno-

ramuses that the Union .Tack should never
be at half-mast when the Empire is at war.”
I dare say he was correct, but from what
the Town Clerk afterwards told me, he was
savagely impolite about it.

“Henry Pannikin”: “Lead-swingers” were
numerous in 1918 in France, and a common
complaint was “going dilly.” It was heard
so often that little heed was taken of it, and
when it didn’t impress the doctors there were
some surprisingly quick recoveries. But they
weren’t all fakes. In our billet, at Strazeele,
was a stretcher-bearer who had unsuccess-
fully tried to convince the authorities that
his mind was affected; and three nights in
succession he piled six stretchers against our
door. As there were six of us occupying the
room it was no wonder his behavior struck
us as sinister. Next night we decided to put a
stop to the ritual; we were only just in time.
The bearer Avas pulling the pin out of a
Mills bomb, ready to heave it through the
door. The poor fellow was sent back, but
died on the boat.
* * * *■
“Pick”: I remember another change of
role at the altar-rails (B. 6/8/’25). It
occurred at the church at Gegedzerick
(N.S.W.) ; a wedding party was killing
time until the parson’s arrival by an exhil-
arating game of kiss-in-the-ring. The climax
in one round was reached when the best
man frantically struggled with and repeatedly
kissed the prospective bride. The next sen-
sation was a cloud of dust behind a gallop-
ing horse that faded away toward the Adam-
inaby pub; the incensed bridegroom had de-
finitely withdrawn from further proceedings.
It was up to the ’groomsman, and he never
faltered. When the belated minister at last
arrived the wedding went on without the man
who should have been the principal.
«. * *
“Sclmorrer”: The cableman has been giv-
ing a few lines to the affairs of an Anglican
parson who began life as a Roumanian Jew.
After being converted he married an Eng-
lishwoman, describing himself at the time as
a widower. Actually he had been married
before, as early as 1872, but he claims that
two years later he was divorced under Jewish
law'. The argument, which affects the legi-
timacy of his three English children, is as
to whether the Jewish divorce can be recog-
nised as valid by British law\ If it had
occurred in, say, Turkey, there would have
been no doubt about it: there the Jewish
religious heads are allowed full authority in
regard to the domestic affairs of their com-
munities, and the Jew desiring a divorce
need merely serve his wife with a “Get”
(a document of 12 lines setting forth his
intention), and then go before a Rabbi to
have his union dissolved. But Roumania
has its own law's of marriage and divorce
which the Jews have to observe, along with
the rest of the population. Still, in most
Eastern European countries the Jews are
in the habit of regarding their own customs
as all that really matter; and it is quite
possible that some Eastern European Jews
now in Australia may be in the same posi-
tion as the converted Hebrew who is now an
Anglican parson.
“Nikko”: The Maoriland Government is
about to close its small leper station on Quail
Island, in Lyttelton Harbor, where the
patients are three Europeans, four Maoris
and two Chinese. Recently Dr. Frengley,
who was the great standby of the Govern-
ment in the 1918 ’flu epidemic, was commis-
sioned to investigate conditions at Mokogai,
the leper island near Fiji. He expressed
himself as thoroughly satisfied with the ex-
cellent management of the station, and the
opportunities afforded the patients of re-
covery, and the M.L. Government consulted
the nine unfortunates on Quail Island with
a view of transferring them. They all con-
sented to go, and will leave at an early date,
their upkeep in their new surroundings being
paid by the M.L. authorities. On Mokogai
life is made as pleasant as possible for the
leper, what with remunerative work, picture-
shows and educational facilities.
* * * *
“Car”: Re out-of-the-common birth-rate
achievements. There is a Burwood (N.S.W.)
lady who married when she was 19, and came
along with her first offspring, twins, four
years later. A gap of nearly three years
followed, and then another pair of twins
appeared. Two years afterwards the third
pair arrived, but, unlike their predecessors,
who were all healthy and perfectly normal,
the last lot came on the scene prematurely
and lived only a few days. A “run” of twins
of this sort is not altogether rare, and the
explanation is a perfectly simple anatomical
one, though slightly too technical for the
general reader.
* * * *
“Kerys”: A youthful motor-cyclist the
other day received a pleasant thrill when he
noticed that, fast as his pace was, another
cyclist behind was doing his best to catch
him. Putting on a good spurt, he soon
achieved 40 miles an hour, and was presently
gratified to discover that he had shaken off
the challenger. It was a much less gratified
youth who faced the beak a few days later
to answer a charge of exceeding the speed-
limit, with the other cyclist, a police patrol,
testifying feelingly to the pace that had been
set. A sporting magistrate, however, took a
lenient view, and let the youth off with a
caution, holding that when challenged to a
a race it is only human to respond. The
policeman, who was reprimanded for his
action, remarked aggrievedly that he was
merely hurrying to take the other man’s
number.

“Yacko” : It is curious to reflect that the

inside prison walls. In 1826 Edward Gibbon
Wakefield, a barrister and diplomat, coerced
a schoolgirl heiress into marriage with him;
the resulting three years in Newgate enabled
him to work out the colonisation scheme on
which South Australia and Maoriland
•were founded and developed. Wakefield’s
cousin, Robert Gouger, did most of the pro-
paganda work, which was consummated in
1836 with the settling of South Australia.
Among zealous supporters of the project were
John Brown. Colonel Torrens, George Fife
Angas and the Duke of Wellington. Colonel
Torrens had aspirations to the Governorship
of South Australia, but the Government offered
the position to Sir Charles Napier, who de-
clined, and recommended his brother-in-law,
Colonel Light. In the interim, however, the
billet had been offered to Sir John Hind-
marsh, who accepted. Wakefield never visited
South Australia, but he emigrated to Maori-
land in 1852, and died there ten years later.

But expenses bounded ahead, although the
only expansion reported was one new branch
and an agency converted into a branch. In
1915 expenses took 49 p.c. of gross profits;
last year they took 53.8 p.c. Nothing was
visibly written off premises, which were in
the books at £437,004 —£19,663 greater on
the year. Perhaps some provision was made
out of undisclosed profits. Capital needs all
the assistance possible from reserves, for
there is no interminable stock or cheap
pref. capital to assist. Reserves at June
30 amounted to £838,933, and that is of
substantial assistance; 5f p.c. on total funds
would be sufficient to pay the 9 p.c. divs.
Balance-sheet figures varied slightly, but
in the right direction :

The liquid position improved, 44.3 p.c. of
money owed to the public being within easy
reach compared with 42 8 p.c. on June 30,
1924. Security for the balance not covered
by liquid assets (£6,845,485) was in advances
with a book value of £8,790,691, and premises
and a trifle of other property totalling
£438,248, while creditors have, in addition,
the security of £1,061,250 callable on the
ordinary shares. The bank is in a position
to expand its lending business, ,but the
management is seemingly content to move
slowly. It still has no Sydney branch, Adel-
aide and London being the only offices outside
Victoria.

The management is looking for larger pre-
mises : the search seems to have become an
annual affair. Gross premiums explain the
necessity : £7329 for the first year. £26,219
for 1924 and then £57,862. Less was re-
insured last year (re-insurance is done
abroad; the eo.’s refusal to abstain from
rate-cutting resulted in its exclusion from
the associated underwriters), but the co.
deals with what it believes are select risks
and is justified in carrying a solid portion
itself. Anyway, last year its estimate ot the
“moral hazard” was confirmed, for. claims
amounted to only £6200; and the directors
“look forward to even lower claims, thougu
the Wild Cat’s idea is that, eenerally speak-
ing, claims in this branch of insurance are
goinp' to move up. Thus far results have
been splendid. The A.I.C. was formed to
handle the business of members ot the Vic.
Automobile Club (outside business was sub-
sequently undertaken), the idea being that
members’ shares should be purchased and
pass into the hands of the Club, which should
be assisted out of profits, in the same manner
as the Vic. Chamber of Manufactures had
been assisted by its insurance proposition.
Although last year’s surplus was £6900, that
included the amount set aside for bonuses
and the sum added to the reserve for un-
expired risks to maintain it at the requisite
40 p.c. In the introductory table reserves
include the latter provision, which on April
30 amounted to £3194. Of the surplus ot
£6905, £1250 was allocated for the payment
of a 24 p.c. bonus on all “comprehensive
policies in force on April 30 last. Of net
income of £26,905 expenses accounted toi
51.6 p.c., a satisfactory figure considering
the age of the concern. It has been rendered
possible, of course, by the particular advan-
tages enjoyed; but when the office has ceased
to caravan around the city and renewals arc
thrown in over the counter, exes, should be
reduced very materially and without mucli
effort, always assuming that present pre-
miums prove sufficient to carry the extra
benefits provided. Paid capital increased by
£1925 last year, 3850 £1 shares paid to aOs.
having been issued. On April 30 liabili-
ties aggregated £10,995. Gilt-edged stock
amounted to £17,832, cash and accrued inter-
est £4366, sundry debtors (these should be
itemised) £7248, and furniture, motor-cars
and stationery £1603. Preliminary exes, had
been reduced to £l6O, and the Board is writ-
ing off that and motor-cars, etc., m an
earnest manner.

The co. is not onlv maintaining its business,
but actually expanding it. The _ trouble
is that low-wage European countries have
been exporting linseed products in large
quantities to Britain, and the lower rates
there have so affected Australian prices that
margins have been narrow. Linseed cake,
which accounts for two tons out of every
three tons of seed crushed, is less of. a pro-
blem than the oil. The two commodities can-
not be separated, but oil is the central point
of the industry. Prejudice against the local
article long since disappeared. The co. has
won its market and has also successfully
propagated the idea of scientific stock-feeding
with linseed meal. It is also. stimulating
primary production by advertising its will-
ingness to buy seed—it is no credit to Aus-
tralian agriculture that £b44.234 worth ot
linseed was imported in 1922-23 and £385,585
worth in 1923-24. An increased duty on oil
is being sought, and a strong case was made
out before the Tariff Board.
In 1911 the old Meggitt business was pur-
chased, and before the table opens the co.
had more than a fair share of troubles. Un-
satisfactory plant and a fire were early diffi-
culties. There was a writing-off of capital,
later restored. From that point most of the
history is written in the figures. In 1921
the price of seed tumbled from £46 to £2O per
ton, and, as the co. had to purchase seed
three months before use, losses were inevi-
table. The effect showed more acutely in
1922 results. Thereafter, conditions im-
proved. Last year gross income was a
trifle larger, but expenses mopped up more
than in the previous term: you cannot have
expansion without expenses moving also. In
1924 the S.A. Linseed Oil and Stock Food
Milling Co., Ltd., was purchased, and the
plant modernised and moved to a better site
at Port Adelaide. This branch mill com-
menced manufacturing during the year and
shareholders are informed that good progress
has been made in the central State. The
Victorian mill is also reported to be showing
satisfactory results. Decentralisation ot
manufacturing is not generally desirable
owing to its expensiveness, but in the case
of linseed freight costs make manufacture
near market centres essential. In addition the
Sydney plant has been kept up to date, so
that the co. is well equipped to meet demand.
Balance-sheet movements were as follows: —
1922. 1924. 1925.
Liabilities .. . . £19,188 £109,688 £99,348
Premises and plant.. 99,995 141,843 164,453

Book debts .. 55,405 75,179 75,052
Cash, etc 17,251 64,903 4,248
There were stocks, book debts and lesser
items amounting to £205,208 to represent
liabilities of £99,348. Most of the latter con-
sists of drafts drawn under Eastern credit
which, at £86,300, were £7116 less on the
year. Sundry creditors showed a diminution
of £lO,OOO-odd at £6065, but the co. went to
its bankers for £6922. There was a net
expansion in fixed assets (depreciation of an
unspecified amount is provided for) of
£22,610, and this, with the reduction of lia-
bilities, is a reassuring movement. With so
much capital tied up in stocks it is not sur-
prising that the creditor items should be
substantial. The prefs. are very well secured.
After all liabilities had been covered
first prets. were secured by tangible assets
with a book value of £l3 per share and
second prefs. (which rank after the firsts)
by £l2 per share. Divs. for both look certain
enough: last year’s small profit was more
than five times greater than the necessary
amount.

There is nothing in that profit to suggest
that last season’s was a record crop. And
it might be made to look even less. The
accounts show a surplus of £33,240, of
which £lO,OOO is transferred to a taxation
suspense account; and if the Taxation hounds
take the lot, only £23,240 is left. A sum of
£BOOO has, however, been sent direct to a
replacement fund; and in the table that
has been regarded as profit, though with some
hesitation. There is no obvious reason why
£lO,OOO should be put by for taxation; but
the Taxation Department of Queensland is
very hungry and is ready to fight for almost
any bone, and dig up almost any yard on
the off-chance of finding one. But, when
all this has been said, one can’t understand
why this co. didn’t make more money last
year with a crushing of about 108,000 tons.
Certainly large additions and improvements
were made to plant; but, as the next table
shows, big sums on this account were charged
to capital:—

Fixed assets were expanded by £69,741 dur-
ing the year (working plant £11.241, mills
£20,299, and landed estates £33,708) ; and
the bank was leaned on to the extent of an
additional £65,202 to do it. The div. was
the usual 8 p.c.; or, rather, the average
8 p.c., for divs. have varied widely. But
it is worth noting that whereas 104 p.c.
has been paid in 13 years, 48 p.c. has been
paid in the past four, which suggests that
things have improved with the industry.
And so, of course, they have. If they hadn’t,
we shouldn’t be worrying now about over-
production. In that connection matters
have improved considerably during the last
few weeks. Imperial preference when Barn-
say Macdonald took office in Britain was
£4 ss. 7d. a ton ; his Government reduced it
to £1 18s. lOd. Baldwin has put it back
to the old level. This is a big thing for
Australia; it applies not only to sugar but
to sugar content of manufactures (jam, e.g.,
is 50 p.c. sugar). Counting the Australian
surplus production for the current season
at 150,000 tons —probably a conservative
estimate —the preference over (say) Java-
nese black-grown sugar will represent about
£640 000. Nevertheless, we have to realise
that that will still leave the surplus to be
sold at about £lO a ton less than the Aus-
tralian price; and every grower will have to
carry his proportion of the low-priced sales.
And that makes the future profits of the
business somewhat uncertain, though this
Column declines to take any gloomy view of
the case.

A shade better than last half-year. But
there is still nothing wonderful in the pro-
position. For the twelvemonths to March
31 profits were equal to 12f p.c. on capital,
which is by no means out of the way for a
co. handling mainly luxury lines largely on
t.-p. during a period of exceptional pros-
perity and unparalleled free-spending. Re-
serves are building up, but they have a long
way to go before the management should
feel content. For there is an inevitable end
to the widespread rush to mortgage the last
shilling of the weekly screw on lay-by fal-
lals and t.-p. motor-cars and player-pianos.
Meantime figures show a further expansion
of business on the credit basis: —

The grouping of stock with t.-p. totals is a
practice not to be commended. • The grouped
item was £46,014 greater than a year ago.
The consequent dependence on outsiders had
become uncomfortably heavy by the end of
the year. It was therefore decided to call
up ss. per share on the contribs. payable
2s. 6d. each on June 18 and August IS.
This will provide £26.294, and will increase
capital to £219.114. The immediate outlook
is untroubled. Nicholsons has passed through
dry periods before without the flicker of an
eyelash, and while there will be more shares
to feed next year, provided the evil day will
be obliging enough to keep out of sight until
reserves have been further built up, share-
holders may see their 10 p.c. divs. undis-
turbed. There are net visible tangibles
equal to 225. Id. for each £1 of capital.

The customary staff bonus was paid last
balance and that absorbed £1122 of the pro-
fits for the six months. And the progress m
trust business having continued, the directors
recommended the familiar 21 p.c. dividend.
Trusts administered expanded £440,881 on
the year, amounting on April 30 to
£4,039,989. In 1920 they totalled £2,448,598
and in 1915 £1,713.224: impressive progress.
With reserves of £42,000-odd helping capital
(£27,000) the 154 p.c. average div. is a
simple matter. Allowing that funds earn
5 p.c. p.a.—a modest figure—earnings from
the trust business have to supply less than
£750 a year to permit a continuance of re-

so the return from the hotel business was

however, by an unspecified amount of good-
will. On April 30. trade creditors and bank
overdraft amounted to £32,351. against which

Dairy companies throughout Australia have found
Pioneer AA'ood Pipe wonderfully useful. This report
from the Casino Co-operative Dairy Co., Ltd., is
typical; “We have found it an ideal pipe for the
purpose (carrying refuse water and buttermilk), and
although in use for nearly 10 years we found
on cutting it recently that the wood was in perfect
state of preservation and appeared to be as good
as the' day it was put in the ground. We consider
that it has three times the life of any other class
of pipe.” The Australian Wood Pipe Co., Ltd.,

were more or less liquid assets aggregating
£4488. Tlie value of property and fittings is
obscured by the inclusion of goodwill in the
entry, the whole being in the books at
£117,939. The bank overdraft obviously is
substantial, and the amount of goodwill
should be stated. Two years ago extensive
additions were made to the premises, but the
fact that another hotel is to be erected at
Coogee must affect the Coogee Bay, although
its position should insure it the major por-
tion of the off-season patronage, and it should
be no less crowded in the busy season. On
this latter aspect the directors report: ‘‘The
intermittent nature of the patronage is a
serious problem. The capacity of the hotel
is only taxed at Easter, [and this] entails
the maintenance of a staff larger than jior-
mally necessary.” The co. possesses a very
valuable property and should continue to
win steady money, but there is little like-
lihood of anything brilliant.

Golden Horseshoe’s (W.A.) 1924 output
was worth, with gold premium added,
£257,000. Profit, plus £12,033 brought for-
ward, was £47,107, of which a tax-free
div. absorbed £30,000. Taxation, about
£S9OO, was taken from reserves provided in
previous years. Ore reserves still exceed
the half-million mark, but under present
working conditions the grade, with no gold
premium to swell receipts, doesn’t augur well
for future profits. The co. lately applied to
the State Government for a loan in order to
work the mine on a bigger scale. Its re-
quest is still under consideration.
Lalla Rookh (W.A.) lias come a cropper.
The Bulletin said at the time of flotation
that there wasn’t enough in the show to make
divs. for a co., and, later on, remarked that
results had turned out the reverse of what
unwary shareholders expected from the pub-
lished assay sheets. The co. managed to
get along with calls for a time, but ultimately
shareholders bucked and the mortgagee’s
bailiff took possession.
Westralian lead-mining is showing a little
more activity. On its oldest field, Northamp-
ton, several mostly indigent Adelaide cos.
have lately acquired options, and others are
waiting for inducements to follow suit. In-
land from Onslow, in the Ashburton district,
the old Uarra mine is producing again, and
at Braeside, north of Marble Bar, several
parties are' at work. Glowing reports have
been circulated from time to time about the
value of this field, but from all accounts it
is too far away to be any good to a co. —
transport costs are too high.
King of Creation Co. (W.A.) has aban-
doned its search for gold, and is now looking
for lead. Options have been acquired on
two leases at Galena, and on the strength
of cheerful reports Adelaide is trying to
bring about a market flutter. This makes
the third attempt of the co. in the West to
make money. First it boomed and abandoned
a “golden” duffer near La vert on, then it
tackled a small thing on the Yilgarn field.

Lake View Investment Trust, formed a
few years ago to solve tax problems which
beset the old Lake View and Oroya (W.A.),
and now a flourishing London financial cor-
poration, issued another annual report the
other day. Profit amounted to £66,937,
which, with £7280 brought in, made £73,21 1.
The directors recommended a final os p.c.
div., making 124 p.c. for the year, less 3s. 3d.
in the £ tax; £8595 is carried forward, llie
value of the co.’s investments, which are many,
exceeds £1,500,000. This is equivalent to
255. per share. Chairman Govett announced
the issue of £250,000 5 p.c. stock at 964-_ The
issue has been guaranteed for a commission
of 14 p.c.; thus the co. will net £95 per
bond.' This £250,000 of stock will comprise
the only charge on assets. The object of its
issue is to permit of wider operations.

“Nemesis” : Perth promoters of the West-
ralian manganese float (B. 16/7/ 2o) claim
that the vendor (a Fremantle chemical co.)
is not greedy, but as it intends to grab two-
fifths of the proposed issues of shares and
debentures as purchase consideration, it
wants a lot. The prospectus asserts that
the Broken Hill Prop, has agreed to provide
£lO.OOO of the capital required. Something
is also said in the prospectus about a_ serious
manganese famine at the end of this year.
As to that, the Soviet Government has given
an American combine a concession at Chia-
tura and stipulated that the concessionaire
must export annually certain very large
quantities during the 20 years of the con-
tract.

Dr. Arthur Wade, petroleum adviser to
the Federal Government, made a flying trip
through the oilfields in the south-east of
South Australia, taking three days to look
over Mt. Gambier and Oaroline-Nelson, near
the Victorian border, where South Austra-
lian Oil Wells Co. and Point Addis Oil Co.
are punching three bores down. He was accom-
panied by Dr. G. B. Pritchard, 14 . Barag-
wanath, Vic. State Geologist; and Pascoe
and Knight of the Associated Oil Co. of Syd-
ney. Wade went overland to Fremantle to
catch a boat, and lias promised the Minister
for Home and Territories to post liis report
from Colombo. Should it be not quite favor-
able the doctor will be safely in London be-
fore the curses of the local oil-seekers begin
to crystallise.
Another shot is being made at the Mt.
Painter radium area, funds coming partly
from a Collins-street doctor and Allen Bow-
ler's followers. The end of the war saw
the blow-out of prices, and so Radium ex-
traction Co. got in fresh capital from the Mt.
Painter Radium Co. It has had Prof.
Douglas Mawson and Dr. Cooke on the job
of evolving a recovery scheme for separating
radium from the matrix. On the mine a
new rich shoot of ore has been opened up
for 55ft., and half a mile off another good
face is on view. Water is short and trans-
port expensive; but with cheaper carriage, a
fair output of ore assured, and less costly
recovery methods Mt. Painter yet may rope
in profits. Works at Dry Creek are to be
ready in a few months’ time, when 10
tons of concentrates a week will be handled.

Lucknow Pups (N.S.W.) is after another
16-acre lease to the south-east, “because
the joint position in Pups promises to con-
tinue its s.-e. course through the 16 acres.”
A subsidiary co. is spoken of. In this step
the Pups people, still call-payers, are cer-
tainly keener and more optimistic than were,
for instance, the Kdna May crowd _ at
Westonia (W.A.) in 1916. Though paying
a regular monthly div. of 6s. on their 40,000
shares, they refused to give £6OOO for the
adjoining Deeps lease, on the ground that
their reef was going down too straight to
dip into the Deeps before 1000 ft., and that
the water problem prohibited mining lower
than that. Despite this theory, and the
“saving” of £BOOO, the lode dipped into the
Deeps at 498 ft. The acquisition of the area
would have built several dividends atop of
the £9-odd paid by the May.
. Chairman Duncan, of South Lucknow
(N.S.W.), has little of immediate interest
in his latest circular to shareholders, who
have held on with great fortitude since 1921.
The large bodies of low-grade ore in sight
“will be of great value so soon as the richer
patches are located,” a truism applicable
generally in the gold-reefing industry. “We
are at present prospecting in several direc-
tions, with more or less encouraging results
while it would be premature to prophesy
immediate success, the nature of the deposits
located bear identical indications which led
to success in the past.” Duncan does not
stress where this past success was achieved.

From S. L. Strevens: —
Add to the list of 10 bores cited by “G. 0.5.”
(B. 9/7/'2O) the deep one at Portland (Vic.), sunk
by the Mines Department years ago and the 1900 ft.
Associated Oil Corporation’s bore near Mt. Gambler
(S.A.). A dozen bores in an area of thousands of
square miles! To say that the “territory has Item
well and widely drilled” is tantamount to a statement
that Australia is over-populated. Reid’s hopeful
report for Mersey Valley Co. was based primarily
on observations made in the field on structure and
stratigraphy, together with a study of the genera’
geological features of that portion of our huge
tertiary areas, in which, of course, the logs of the
bores mentioned by “G. 0.5.” played some part.
It is interesting to note that another school of
geologists, after an examination of the same gdistrict,
interprets the surface phenomena entirely differently
from the Speck’s man, and if Mersey Valley Co. s
boring programme does not end in striking oil
it should at least settle the “structure” controversy.
Rot only have the tertiary deposits of this continent
been inadequately bored with mostly rotten machinery
and inexperienced men, but the position is the same
regarding our mesozoic and carboniferous formations.
The necessity for deep drilling in the tertiaries, to
test their oil possibilities right out, arises only
where the underlying jurassic, silurian, ordovician and
other bedrocks are more than 5000 feet down.
Unfortunately, all the boring evidence to date
strongly supports the contention that our tertiary
formations are not comparable with those of the
“Australasian arc” countries, from New Guinea to
Maori]and, and it is very doubtful if even 8000 feet
of actual tertiary deposits are to be met with
on the mainland. This par. marks my vale to the
search for oil in Australia as at present conducted.
The net result of 10 years’ prospecting, boring and
agitating for a fair run in the interests of the
genuine oil-seeker is a knowledge of a score or two
of places where oil is not and a damaged reputation
because it wasn’t. But I also hope to see the
announcement in The Bulletin that oil has been
struck in Australia, deep down in the AValloons or
Kimberley carboniferous, or at a shallow to medium
depth in our tertiary; and I shall not be at all
surprised if, despite everything, it is struck “acci-
dentally.”
Clive Cooper found no difficulty in floating
Tanami (N.T.) on the prospectus issued last
week. Actual results achieved with the dolly-
pot by the Laurie Bros., and 11. I. Jensen’s
blessing, conquered the pessimism which
largely envelops the industry these days.
Motor-traction and a wireless set will help
to discount the remoteness of the area to
be exploited. It is 86 miles from the West-
ralian border, and the nearest port is the
Victoria River Depot, 350 miles away. Most
of the 80.000 contribs. went in big parcels,
and the 64,000 fully paid to 2s. 6d., though
nominally, along with £l5OO casli, the pur-
chase price of the Laurie-Beckett interests,
will be subject to considerable rake-off.

Kawarau dam is expected to be completed
in November, five months later than the
original forecast. Meantime, Alex. McGeorge,
of Dunedin, who was g.m. of the Electric
Gold Dredging Co. which operated on the
Kawarau from 1895 to 1919, is putting up a
fight on behalf of the old dredges. In a
letter to this Column McGeorge says:—
The Lady Ranfurly dredge, a large and powerful
machine, worked successfully for close on 20 years.
Far from being “a raging torrent,” as described in
some prospectuses, the lower reaches of the Kawarau
are fairly smooth flawing, and during the whole life
of the co. we had no serious accidents. The banks
consist of sandy clay, superimposed by auriferous
drift, apparently an old lake formation, and the bot-
tom is mainly blue pug of a sandy nature, ideal for
a bucket-and-ladder dredge. Big stones, one of
which we measured and found to be 6ft. long, 3ft.
wide and 2ft. thick, were occasionally met with, and
We had special appliances and lifting gear to get
these stones off the buckets. With the exception of
one or two very contracted areas that we looked on
as nests of boulders, every yard of this claim has
been worked more than once, and very little of the
bottom was missed. When the Electric started work
on the Kawarau the old miners, whose judgment I
have since proved by experience could be thoroughly
relied on, assured me that the bottom of the river
was full}' 15 or 20 feet higher than was the case in
the early days. This, they said, had been brought
about by the vast amount of tailings sluiced in years
before by the miners from the banks, and we verified
these statements by actual experience. Many islands,
consisting of heaps of tailings thrown up by the
Electric dredges nearly 30 years ago, are still to be
seen, proving conclusively that heavy tailings do not
shift far. All the gold in the Electric claims was on
the bottom, and the old tailings had all to be lifted
before we could get at it. Electric Ko. 3 claim,
later known as the Junction Electric, at the junction
of the Kawarau and Olutha Rivers and extending
three.quarters of a mile up the Kawarau, was fairly
shallow, easily worked, and was cleaned up from
bank to bank. In my opinion, as far as these old
claims are concerned, there is not even a sporting
chance of winning payable gold from them.

Malaya Tin Corporation, Selangor
(F.M.S.), will liquidate and distribute its
assets provided a majority of shareholders
are willing. There is a division of opinion
on the Board, chairman Kerry being in favor
of liquidation, and his colleagues, George
Blakemore and J. 11. King, against it. The
preliminary meeting only got as far as
the appointment of four shareholders to com-
mune with the Board and go into the pros
and cons. There are some debenture-holders
and a high field official to be considered be-
fore definite steps are possible. After that
it seems plain sailing. There are 84,000 20s.
shares in the co.. which holds 49.000 Takua-
pas. 12.700 Ratruts and 1550 Ivampar
Rivers, besides cash items running into
£lO,lBO. Against all this there are liabili-
ties of only £15,754; so that, unless the
bottom falls out of tin propositions while
formalities are in the way, distributable
assets should pan out at 17s. a share and
upwards. The co. was the pioneer of the
holding concerns associated with Australian
enterprise in Malayan tin dredging, and has
had a successful run ; but recent years have
been so lean, and suitable properties so diffi-
cult to locate, that shares for long were
quoted at about 7s. Since the present scheme
took shape there has been an advance to
around 14s.

Kota, Larut and Tupai, the high-class trio
of Malayan tin-dredging shows in the Pratten
stable excelled themselves during 1924. With
£28,560 net, Kota earned £7472 more than in
1923, treating 1,028,000 yards at a cost of 4d.
as against 994:000 at .31)44. The 345 tons
tin oxide realised £136 15s. a ton against 329
tons at £139 Bs.. yardage profit being 7.02 d.
against 5.57 d. Holders got 2s. 6d. a share,
compared with 2s. in 1923. Larut treated
1,019.000 yards of .961 b. ground and got
435.09 tons oxide against 431.48 tons from
1.014,000 yards of .951 b. ground in 1923.
At £142 10s. a ton. the product gave £62,011
gross and £43,355 net against £50.540 gross
and £32,847 net from the £ll7 2s. 9d. market
in 1923. Working costs were 4.27 d. against
4.17 d., and yardage profit 10.34 d. against
7.79 d. Holders got ss. a share, against 3s.
in 1923. Tupai turned over 1,021,000 yards
of 1.51 b. ground against 1,006,000 of 1.031 b.
in 1923. At £142 19s. a ton, gross revenue
was £96,232. against £320 365. 3d. find
£56.793. Net return at 18.65 d. a yard was
£76,241. compared with 9.61. d. and £38,718.
Working costs were higher, being 4.31 d.
against 3.74 d. Holders got 4s. in divs.
against 2s. in 1923. In the case of all three
companies, the higher cost of wood fuel is
set down as the chief reason for higher treat-
ment cost.

Takuapa Valley, Western Siam, appears to
have, at long last, commenced earth-eating
in earnest. The July yield was 45 tons oxide
from 100.000 yards, just pound ground to a
nicety. This is 2oz. better than the boring
chart averages. The plant, however, is only-
working at two-thirds capacity. The pumps
are the same as those which have done every-
thing required of them in the Kota and
Tupai plants; but physical conditions at
Takuapa demand somethin? more powerful.
The persistent delays mean that Takuapa.
whose Board visualised a clear sheet when
production began, has found it necessary to
pledge its credit for over £15,000. Divi-
dends may, of course, be paid out of current
earnings. It would not be the first time this
has been done, but a tidy co. prefers to clean
up the premises before paying out.
Field-manager R. S. Haynes, of the New
Guinea Oil Co., Orokola Bay. has a doleful
tale to tell of excessive rainfall. They ex-
pect 200 in. a year along the Gulf of Papua,
but Haynes and his corduroy road have had
an extra 75in. superimposed during the past
quarter. The countryside resembles a shak-
ing bog more than anything else; and a
period of intense sunshine must intervene
before the oil quest can be taken up again
with any prospect of progress.

His hosts never knew wliat Admiral Rob-
ison would say nfext. At one seance he was
asked if he would take whisky. Yes, he
would take whisky, and it was brought.
“What’s this?” he asked. “Scotch,” they
said. “I don’t want Scotch,” barked the sea-
dog; “I came here to sample Australia.
Haven’t you got any Australian whisky?”
The waiter returned to say he was sorry
there wasn’t any available. “Then I’ll take
Australian beer—l guess you can find me
some Australian beer.” And Australian beer
they brought him, and Australian beer he
drank.
Rev. Septimus Hungerford, Australia’s
oldest clergyman, celebrated his 100th
birthday the other day. Born in England,
he arrived in Sydney at the age of three,
and lived with his parents in a house in
Pitt-street. Then the Hungerfords moved
to the Glebe, which in those days was mostly
bush, where emus and kangaroos could be
seen. After studying the law for a while
Septimus _ entered the Church, and was
ordained in 1854, taking charge of the parish
of Armidale (N.S.W.), which stretched for
250 miles. The G.0.M., who retired in 1895,
is still in fine fettle.
Farmer Allan, Yic.’s Premier, got through
the grandstand business while Uncle Sam’s
Fleet was in Melbourne in a way that agree-
ably surprised his friends. His easy-going,
unaffected style pleased the Yanks. He was
content to attend the functions as an ordi-
nary citizen instead of as a procession, an
institution or a symbol of democracy.
The death in Melbourne last week of
Walter Madden, ex-Minister for Lands, was
no surprise, as he had been in feeble health
for some time. When district surveyor at
Horsham in the late ’seventies Walter took
a fancy to the constituency and won it in
1880. The following year he joined Bryan
O’Loghlen’s Peace-Progress-Prosperity Minis-
try as Lands Minister. He long outlived the
other 11 in that famous team which kept
Berry and Service apart for 20 months, and
whose names recall scenes and events that
prevented the tail end of last century from
getting too staid —O’Loghlen, Bent. J. M.
Grant, Charlie Young, Graves, Gaunson,
Burrowes, Henry Bolton, £ £ Smith,
Macßain and Dobson. For the last 35 years
Walter was managing director of the
National Trustees Co.
Alec Nicholson, Vie. Chief of Police, who
nas been seriously ill, resigned at the begin-
ning of the week. Ignoring derogatory
remarks about him in the Police Commis-
sion’s report, the Ministry re-appointed him
for a year from April 11. This enabled him
to march out with flying colors and six
months’ full pay in lieu of leave; and he will
draw a pension of £OOO a year. Following
the precedent established by the S. Aus.
Government which appointed Raymond
Leane, the Yic. Cabinet has gone to the A.I.F.
for a Police Commissioner, having named T.
A. Blarney as Nicholson’s successor. Blarney,
a native of Wagga, was a schoolteacher be-
fore he adopted soldiering as a profession.
One of the brilliant young Australian army
men who received part of their training at
Quetta, he went to Gallipoli as an intelli-
gence officer, and when the “cease fire”
sounded in France was Chief of Staff, A.1.F.,
with the rank of Brigadier-General. Not
yet 42, he is to get £l5OO p.a. for five years.
While England is ringing with praise for
the plucky failure of Lieut.-Colonel Bernard
Frcyberg, V.C., D.S.O. and two bars, nine
wounds and six mentions in despatches, to
swim the Channel, Australians gratefully
remember another aquatic effort of his which
was brilliantly successful. It was Freyberg
who swam from a warship in the Gulf of
Saros on the morning of April 25, 1915, and.
landing at Bulair, the narrowest part of the
Peninsula, ran up and down the beach light-
ing flares, firing shots and generally behav-
ing like an army corps. The feint succeeded,
the Turks began a concentration in the direc-
tion of the demonstrator, and the descent on
Anzac Cove was made that much less peril-
ous. Freyberg, though educated in Welling-
ton College (M.L.), was born in London. Pie
is now in the Grenadier Guards.
Syd Reynolds, the second of a famous trio
of stockbreeding brothers, has gone over
the Divide. The eldest was Frank, who
owned Tocal, and who knew everybody and
everything in the stud business, back to the
days when Tyson and Harry Bracker, the
Jenkinses and the Dumaresqs were the lads of
the village, wherever there was a village.
Syd bequeaths to a third generation a very
fine Hereford herd. The remaining member
of the Reynolds dynasty is Percy, of Hobart-
ville, the old Cox home at Richmond
(N.S.W.), once famous as Bellevue stud.
His Herefords include several Sydney Royal
champions and one English Royal reserve
champion; and in his spare moments he and
his sons breed racehorses of the quality
of Sunburst, which won the 1923 Newmarket.
Incidentally, their home has an interest for
old Bulletin readers, in that “The Breaker”
once worked and rode there.
If there’s a man who knows the South
Seas or the eastern Australian coasts, from
Melbourne to the Gulf, better than Captain
Tom Cloherty, Brisbane’s harbormaster, he
remains undiscovered. Cap’n Tom became
acquainted with the port of Brisbane in ’75,
having left his native Galway as a lad. He
gained the silver medal of the Royal Humane
Society for saving life off the Bulwer when
the Grace Darling stranded on the beach in
1894, and went coastwise for years in the
old barques Tatliam and Melton Badger,
carrying mails to the Gulf of Carpentaria.
Lionel Potter, head of the Vic. C. 1.8., has
resigned owing to ill-health, and will get a
pension. Only a few weeks ago he was in
the field against all-comers for the Chief
Commissionersliip, but High Authority gave
him to understand that there were difficul-
ties which could not he surmounted if ho
pushed his claims on the retirement of

detective force.
Nicholson. Perhaps if there had been hope
of gratifying his ambition Potter would have
got over the health handicap. He will be
succeeded by T. J. Montague, till recently
an inspector.
Though he kept clear of the fierce limelight
that beats on public men, Leonard Bakewell,
just dead in Adelaide at 70, was better
known than most of the S. Aus. lot. He was
at various times commodore of the Yacht
Club,* president of the Hunt Club, and a
member of S.A. Jockey Club committee. Lat-
terly he was a director of Elder, Smith’s,
Adelaide Steamship Co., and the Reynella
wine co. In his own business, the Law,
Bakewell and Percy Stow were originally
junior partners of Josiali Symon, K.C., but
about 30 years ago they left him and took in
a promising junior, as Bakewell, Stow and
Piper. The latter is now K.C., and carries
on the firm, with a Bakewell son and his own
son, as Piper, Bakewell and Piper.
With a fine record of public service to his
credit, Tom Smith, of Soutli and Port Mel-
bourne* passed out the other day hard on
the heels of Trenwith and Walter Madden,
with whom he had served in A r ic. Leg. Assem-
bly. Returned to the State Lower House
by Emerald Hill six times between 1880
arid 1904, Smith worked his way out of the
ruck, and was in the front line when his
constituency was wiped out 21 years ago.
He narrowly escaped inclusion in two Lib-
L. GOVERS, Director of Immigration in
N. S. Wales.
eral Governments. He was a Laborite, but
the cast-iron rule forbidding the taking of
office in a Liberal Government did not apply
in his time. Tom was not the least of the
four Smiths who were in the House in his
day. The other three were Murray, Charles,
and W.C. (the Colonel).
“lan C.”: When Allan McLean displaced
George Turner in Vic. Assembly in 1899
there was an outbreak of indignation in
Liberal constituencies, and the Opposition
thought it well to nurse this wrath to keep
it warm. Just-dead Tom Smith induced
Turner to open the campaign in his con-
stituency (Emerald Hill, S. Melb.), and the
embers were fanned into a blaze that con-
sumed McLean’s majority in the ensuing 11
months. After the memorable meeting Tom
Smith was noticed in earnest conversation
with Turner, and members looking on sug-
gested that he was saying to the Liberal
leader, “Remember me when thou comest into
thy kingdom.” Turner didn’t remember him
when he became Premier for the second time,
in December, 1900. The disgust of Smith at
seeing Billy Gurr, of Geelong, selected in-
stead was quite justified. Gurr’s inclusion
was one of Turner’s mistakes.
IL. K. Lewcock, who has been chosen from
40 applicants to study the prickly-pear ques-
tion in Mexico and those parts of the
TJ.S.A. where it is a pest, comes, as it hap-
pens, from South Aus., where the pear is
known merely as an occasional ornamental
hedge, the moisture not being enough to help its
spreading unduly. But Lewcock, though only
25, has studied the question closely since a
distinguished career at Roseworthy . (S.A.)
Agricultural College and Adelaide University.
He has held Ridley and Bagot and Lowrie
scholarships for research. His official title
will be “Travelling Mycologist to the Com-
monwealth Prickly-pear Board of Australia.”
Justice Isaacs, of the High Court, who
got a sheaf of congratulations last Thursday
on his 70th birthday, was not born with a
silver spoon in his mouth. He earned the
utensil by studying hard for the law while
quill-driving in the Vic. civil service. Twelve
years after his admission to the Bar in 1880
he was a front-rank counsel, and then began
liis Parliamentary career in the State and
Federal Legislatures. In the State he was
Law Minister four times and in the Com-
monwealth once. For some months he was
Acting Vic. Premier (1897 and 1901), and
while Adrian Knox was in England a year
or two ago he was Acting-C.J. The earnest-
ness with which he supported Peacock in and
out of Cabinet in pushing forward wages-
board legislation will stand to his credit
while there is any gratitude in the toiling
masses.
Alexander Graham, “Yarrum” of The
Bulletin, has fought his last fight about
the sports and pastimes of the white-ant and
the euro. As a school-teacher mostly in the
bush, for 40 years or more, “Yarrum” got
the material for his vivid pars, at first hand.
He was a native of Wollongong (N.S.W.),
where his people were early settlers.
Professor David is taking a ton of
manuscript to London, where his big book
upon the geology of Australia is to bo
printed. Nobody knows more about the sub-
ject. It surprises people who meet the
quiet unassuming little man with the silver
crest for the first time to learn of his adven-
tures, which include a South Polar jaunt with
Sliackleton, the tracking down of the Mag-
netic Pole, and the mining job at Messiers
which made the big 1917 advance possible.
W. F. Ilincliey, the new Ma State Deputy
Comptroller-General of Prisons, entered the
Public Service in 1895 and the Prisons De-
partment five years later. He served as
confidential and special clerk till 1922, when
he was appointed inspector. In his younger
days he was a top-notch cricketer. He played
with East Sydney and figured in a match
against an English Xl—Stoddart’s.
The wild suggestion that AY. A. Holman
may become Governor of Bananaland recalls
that, although there is no record of
a Premier becoming Governor, one very dis-
tinguished Governor afterwards became a
Premier. This was George Grey, who was
Governor of S.A. in 1841, of Maoriland in
1845, of Cape Colony in 1854, and again of
Maoriland in 1801. In 1875 he returned to
the Quaky Isles from the .Cold Country, and
was chosen as member for Auckland in the
House of Reps. Two years later he became
Premier, and his Ministry retained office
until IS7S.
For the first time a member of Vic. Uppah
Chambali has been elected chairman of the
Railways Standing Committee. Bell, who is
an ex-mayor of Ballarat, has got the job.
which, however, means only £3OO a year
instead of £240. Under the rotation system
he will pass it on to Deany, M.L.A., next
session.
“lan C.” : It came as a surprise to most
of his old friends to learn that AY. A. Tren-
with, ex-Labor leader, just dead, had married
again not long after the death of his first
wife. His second wife is a daughter of
James Sinclair, who was A T ic. commercial
agent in London and afterwards in Asia.
Frank Mauger, now president of the Vic.
district of the A.J.A., is a son of Samuel,
former high priest of Protection in Mel-
bourne. When he was a stripling, Frank
attracted the attention of David Syme, who
gave him a start in life. He is now one of
the Age’s seniors. Having an eye and an
ear for humor and a quick appreciation of
human weaknesses, he gets a lot of fun out
of life. told one day by an admirer'
of his dad that people “ought to take off
their hats to Sam Mauger for what he did
for Protection and for his work in suppress-
ing sweating,” Frank said he agreed, as the
hats would wear out sooner. His sire, he
explained, was still in the retail trade.
The L.O.L. in Victoria got a shock at the
sudden outgoing of A. G. C. Ramsay, ex-
M.L.A., who was acting Grandmaster while
Snowball was laid up in hospital. Ramsay,
who lived at AVilliamstown, drove to the
back beach at that suburb to see the fire-
works in honor of the U.S. Fleet. His hands
and feet began to
tingle. A quick
journey home, then
a paralytic seizure,
heart trouble and
the end. The minor
lights he mingled
with in life —
Orangemen, Masons
and Protestant
Alliance f o 1 k—
assembled in hun-
dreds at his grave.
He served in the 1
Leg. Assembly for
four years, but so
long ago that most
people have for-
gotten his Parlia-
mentary career. As
member for demo-
cratic AVilliams-
town he was. neces-
sarily, a Radical
Liberal, and sup-
ported advanced

Few can equal Captain Frank Hurley for
nosing out with a camera the dramatic and
sensational in life. For the last year or two
Hurley has been taking his movie, “Pearls
and Savages,” round the world; but the
genuine picture of primitive man hadn’t as
much money in it as the crudest drammer
of red-blooded cavemen in cowboy hats and
trousers concocted in the studios of Holly-
wood. Consequently he is in Australia again
as the forerunner of an English troupe which
will enact a. thriller of the right sort against
the appropriate background of the tropic
North.

Ballarat is a Hell from Ilell?
Toasting your hoofs at our hottest Jiob,
Hark to our Earth-receiver’s hum!
Swift from the ether waves athrob
News they snatch, and the choicest plum,
News that the gloom from a devil glum
Melts in the trice it takes to tell —
A parson’s word’s good enough, by gum—
Ballarat is a Hell from Hell.
Curse him kindly, that erring gob,
Spending his last beknighted thrum,
Cheered by the Ballaratian mob,
On good brown beer or a ruby rum.
Plain it is as a simple sum —-
In Ballarat did they serve and self
Can aught but the truth from parsons come?
Then Ballarat is a Hell from Hell.

Greatest of
All Essex Values
Greatest of All Essex Years
Built by Hudson, Essex not only shares the advantages of the famous
Super-Six patents, but also the value-building supremacy of their enormous
combined production* And the great Essex sales record is recognition of
a value leadership so overwhelming that it is not even challenged*
The Finest Essex Ever Tinilt
Only among far higher priced cars will you
find comparison for Essex quality, perform-
ance and riding ease. It is a totally differ-
ent type. It gives results no other car ever
gave. It is low priced, without disappoint-
ment in looks or reliability. It provides
stability and finest roadability without
unnecessary weight. It has economy with-
out sacrifice of performance.
You will enjoy driving it for the smooth
vibrationless performance of its quiet
motor. It is so easy to steer and comfort-
able to ride in that even overlong journeys
and rough roads it gives a satisfaction,
associated only with large costly cars.
In quality Hudson and Essex are alike.
The patents which account for Hudson’s
famous reputation for performance, reli-
ability and long life are responsiblejfor the
same qualities in Essex.
We believe it is the most economical car
to own and operate in the world.
After you have driven your Essex long
enough to require attention, you will find
repair and replacement costs so low as to
be almost incredible compared with the
charges that motorists are accustomed
to pay.
All of Hudson’s fifteen years’ experience
in manufacture and development of no-
table service standards are equally part of
your satisfaction in the ownership of an
Essex.
Surely you cannot be satisfied with less
than Essex offers, when its cost is but little
more than cars of the lowest price.
r T\>p POAPH The Hudson-Essex invention, and
L HIS X. more than four years’ development
of the Coach, of course, give it exclusive manufacturing
advantages in this type. No car at or near the price rivals the
Hudson-Essex Coach in actual proof of value—which is SALES.

ABORIGINAUTIES
MADE IN AUSTRALIA
BARNES LINSEED OIL
“L.E.”: I met four blacks at the Gann
(Vie.) who were walking from Eden to* Lake Tyers.
Bare-footed, but dressed in ordinary clothes, they
were pleasant-looking fellows with soft' eyes, broad
noses and shapely brown hands with tel lining white
nails. Their leader was an old man who carried
a long' spear made from the grass-tree. The others
were very shy and silent, but the old man went up
to the group on the pub verandah. He displayed a
cigarette paper, and, being handed the best part of
a plug, he carefully cut off about seven-eighths of
it and then politely handed the small remnant back.
"Nice day, mine tinkit?” someone asked. “If
it doesn’t rain,” he replied in a soft voice. “You
bin catehem fish?” came the second question. “I
caught a few,” he said, “but the fishing is not
what it used to be.” His vocabulary was limited,
but his accent was really classy, with a txmcli of
haw-haw about it. He must have learned English
from an Oxford man.
"(longer” : Why is it; that iS'ortli , Queens-
land is comparatively poorly stocked with marsupials,
whilst in southern Aussie they are numerous
Scientists say that the ’roos came from Asia across
the N.G. Islands, then connected with Australia.
If so, why isn’t rich tropical Queensland swarming
'with ’roos, and only a minority of them spindled
out at the tail-end of the trek down south? I want
to know! Also i want to know why the tree-
climbing ’roo boards in Aknth Aussie only. He
is an exceedingly intellectutil ’roo, bus developed
tile art of thoroughly and prettily clothing himself,
understands the benefit of living i»i little com-
munities and intelligently chattering about the
weather, and is so developed that he cai:
live in trees as well as, or bettor than, on the
ground. To my idea he is by fan the most highly
developed ’roo. If so, wh[y ilsnß he away down
south? Shouldn’t the tail-end of‘ evolution be more
highly developed than the top end, as it were? If
’roo emigration first hopped over the finger-point of
Aussie, then the ’roos in N. S. Wales should by this
time be planting their own grajss. “An’ a darned
pity they’re not,” says the squatter.
* * -i *
“Slam”: Australia’s moist maligned bird is
the bee-eater. Apiarists in Queensland recently failed
in having it removed from the protected list, their
plea being that it destroys gjneat numbers of bees.
The fact is that it does more good than harm to the
beekeeper. It certainly does snap up an occasional
bee, but I have seen it hawking the big reddish robber-
flies far greater killers of bees. The southern
name of rainbow-bird is ntiiich more appropriate te
this beautiful and useful native bird.
* * * *
“lluffin-Gtiffin” : We have two tame mag-
pies and a jackass
running' loose in our
garden. The magpies
are amusing little
cusses. They play like
kittens, rolling each
other over .on the
ground. Then they will
get oti to a perch and
warble beautifully.
Sometimes they wil i
approach “Jack”
and literally poke
fun at him, “Jack”
merely giving a deep-
throated gurgle.. There
is apparently an age-
long feud between
“Mag” and “Jack.”
Jack as a humorist
is an over-estimated
bird. It is Maggie
who is full of fun—
and mischief. Th c
other day I planted
some small shrubs and
an hour or two later
■went to look at them.
They were lying on
top of the ground, the
magpies near by. I’ll
swear they laughed at
me. Recently a friend's
wife put the baby to
sleep outside in its
pram. The baby woke
and started to howl.
Th e family magpie
hustled around, found
a worm, jumped up
on the pram, and tried
to soothe baby by
putting the worm in
its mouth. As an in-
teresting pet bird, give
me a magpie before a
jackass.
“FY7”: Sydney is lucky in having had two
sea leopards come ashore on local beaches within the
past couple of years. The latest was caught in a
net off La Perouse recently, and after being hauled
ashore was passed on to Taronga Zoo. His predecessor
drifted ashore on the beach north of Manly, badly
wounded, having had, apparently, a turn up with
a sword-fish. He also went to Taronga, and died
there. This formidable seal, with his powerful
jaws, full of big teeth, is a dweller in the Antarctic.
Little is known about him, save that his principal
diet is penguins with seagulls as a makeshift.
“Bunya” : I have a theory that the native-
bear’s early demise in captivity is due to the wide-
spread impression that bears never drink. I have found
them plentiful in parts of Queensland many miles
from the nearest waterhole, and they seemed to get
enough moisture from the dewy leaves on which they
fed. But every bushman knows that in dry times
bears gradually work towards water, and I have fre-
quently seen them on logs at a creek’s edge lapping
Up the liquid with the tongue as a cat does. A caged
bear cannot choose its own juicy suckers, and must
therefore have water if it is to live.
“C. Coral" : Johnny Mari’s first-hand ex-
periences of an island thrill: "East week I go walk
about night-time along that sandbeach, close up time
NOT A FIRST-CLASS JOB.
CROWN PROSECUTOR: “Isn’t it a fact that you were once charged with a capital offence?”

high-water. That moon he start come up, I can look
little bit good. By-’n’-bye I slew my eye. look along
that reef close to, I see something lay down on top.
He black, and little bit white underneath. I think
dinghy that* one: might he been lose from some
place and come float along here. I very glad for
find him ; I can report him along Protekita, and then
I get reward one pound. I go more close to now for
look proper; I come ’longside now. My word!
What name that one? He start turn round, then
that moon make good light, and that one he start,
go for me, but I more quick. That one he no
dinghy—he plurry alligator been come from Long
Island! He go off into salt water, but I see him
’gain next day, he swim little bit outside, look round
me I think. Close up I lose that trip!”
“Wingella” : "Kum Day" is rather wide of
the'mark (B. 28/5/’25), Normal white children at
birth look as if they have been parboiled, and re-
semble nothing so much as a monkey carved out of
half a brick. Nor does the red color fade for some
days; I have known it to last a month. Abo. babies
are usually yellow at birth, but darken very soon,
helped by the mother, who rubs them with charcoal
and goanna grease to make them turn black quickly.
I saw one half-caste baby within a few minutes of
its birth; it was a mottled purple, and looked like
a hideous gargoyle. Ido not know how many babies
“Kum Day” has known, nor what ages they were,
but I’ve seen a dozen or so black kiddies within an
hour or so of birth, and as many white youngsters.
As to the white mothers darkening, that is bunkum.
If they did darken, there are quite a few mothers I
know who should closely approximate the nigger
color by now; women of the brunette type, who have
had from 7 to 15 children each. If they have
changed in color at all, it has been to become light
. rather than to darken. But I reiterate that the
average half-caste woman darkens remarkably
quickly after child-bearing, and whether she be mar-
ried to white man or black it makes no difference;
she darkens just as rapidly with the one husband as
with the other. Another thing is peculiar to half-
caste children; they are remarkably quick and* intel-
ligent, and a delight to teach, when small, hut get
very dull in tlieir teens, and are then inferior to
both the black and the white. Their minds seem to
come to a full stop at the age of 14 or 15.
**, * *
“Buttenderry” : I luive shot a good many
plain turkeys, along the Barcoo, and have never noticed
the cunning attributed to them by “Pick” (B.
16/7/’25). In a good season, when the birds were
plentiful, all one had to do was to hop on a quiet
horse and -ride through any of the paddocks ami
shoot them from horse-back as they rose. They
didn’t require any stalking. As a rule, they would
rise about 50 yards off and flap awkwardly along
for anything up to 100 yards before reaching an
altitude of more than about 20 feet. On one
occasion, when l was out: mustering, a big gobbler
rose fully 40 yards ahead of me. I wasn’t carrying
a gun, but we had turkey for tea that night. I
galloped up and, as 1 passed under him, chopped
upwards with my stockwhip and brought him down.
“•Polycarp”: Australian landscape gard-
eners haven’t even yet discovered many of our own
native flowering trees and shrubs. It is not unusual
to see the elm and oak planted in place of native
ornamental trees, some of which are among the
finest in the world. The gorgeous flame-tree of our
eastern coast, the gigantic lily, the Christmas bush,
bottle-brushes, and many of the pittosporums are
popular in English and American gardens, but if on"
wants to see them in Australia one must go to the
bush. The wattle is about the only native flowering
tree which has come into its own with us, in spite
of the fact that our native flora thrive well in poor
soil and stand dry conditions.
* * * *
“W.P.T.” : The most effective rabbit-trap
1 have seen was made out of chaff-bags. Two holes,
large enough for a rabbit to pass through, were cut
in the wire netting surrounding a lucerne patch. It
took the rabbits no time to find these entrances
and they flocked in during the night. Before day-
light the chaff-bags were tied round the outside of
the holes and renewed from time to time. A dog
was then liberated in the Daddoek. The first morn-
ing we get 18-1 chaff-bags full of rabbits.
JACKY SUMS HIM UP.
“Could drink beer all day long one time,
Jacky. Can't do it note, though.”
“You like me, boss. Y’ ain't got the plurry
money.”
"F.P.J.": The clearness of the atmosphere
in certain parts of Australia is remarkable. On the
Barkly Tableland (N.T.) in the early mornings 1
have seen cattle on hills 30 miles distant, a mirage
throwing reflections under them giving the impression
of water lying there. The stars, too, can cast
shadows equal to the young moon.

A BRIGHT DAY GONE.
[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
There’s a road runs out of Ric hmond
That once I journeyed on
With a merry, merry road-mate
On a bright day gone.
It was weather made for rovers—
So sweet it was and bland;
And 'twas good to see the sunshine
On the broad green land.
Light of foot and heart we travelled,
As they should ever go
Who roam adown the long roads
Where the four winds blow.
Though we’d often drunk in taverns
And found the drinking fine,
Yet we’d never tasted vintage
Like the air’s pure wine.
It was not of gold we gossiped.
And, faith, 'twas not of pride,
But of things that little mattered,
As we strode, side by side.
With no pride at all within us,
And gold beyond our reach,
’Twas of birds and flowers and suchlike
That we talked, each to each.
(I any miles we strolled together,
And always were our words
Of the pretty wild blossoms
And the bright singing birds.
Oh, ’twas sweet to hear the thrushes,
And good to see the crops,
As we journeyed through the lowlands
To the high mountain tons
PRIMA FACIE EVIDENCE.
“You seem to ’arc a cold, Mister Sandgrain.”
“Doh, I dabbn't. I dad a berry bub code, but I'm gidding drib
obbit.”
Over lowlands, over highlands,
’Twas thus we travelled on,
Till we came among the orchards
Where the gold fruitage shone.
Orange orchards, glossy leafage!
Oh. never had we seen
Such a wealth of golden fruitage
In a landscape so green.
Sunset found us still a-roving
Through country fair and sweet,
With a mealy dust upon us
But with light hearts and feet.
Thus we took the road from Richmond
And gaily journeyed on—
Two together, merry road-mates,
On a bright day gone.

“Hnffin-Guffin” : If the total figures given
by “Pick” (B. 9/7/’25) are right, which seems
doubtful from the individual heights mentioned,
I think the six Ferrier brothers of Coleraine
(Vic.) could beat them. They totalled about 38ft.
6in., the tallest being only 6ft. Gin. The following
generation of Ferriers average only medium height,
though well built.

“Wonkonguru”: Fair-haired abos. (B.
25/6/’25) seem to be a distinct type, as they almost
invariably reproduce fair-haired children, even when
crossed with the ordinary black. When the mission
people tried to break up the Murdu, or Totem,
organisation of the Dieri and Arunta tribes they
transferred young men and women from Hermansburg
and Kopperamanna (N.T.) missions respectively, and
crossed the Arunta young men with Dieri young
women and vice versa. Some of the Hermansburg
young men were fair-haired, and the type persists to
this day. I know of several families, and one in
particular, in which the fair hair has persisted for
four generations. Samuel, now a man of about
50 years of age, was the result of a cross between
a fair-haired Arunta and a black-haired Dieri. His
hair had a slight coppery tinge, his daughter had
rust-colored hair, although apparently a pure-blooded
abo., her children were all rust-colored, and their
children are indeterminate, some having rust-colored
hair and others the straight black locks of the Dieri
BACK-FIRED, IN SHORT.
“ What’s the matter, Bill—had a smash?”
“Drove a weddin’ party yesterday and went
’ome well oiled. The missus got cranked
and flew into high gear; and when I
tried to release ’er clutch she damaged
one o’ me wings and a ’eadlamp.”
type. One thing I noticed was that the thatch of
these fair-haired blacks was very fine in texture—
rather like Chinese in appearance. I have long had
a theory that the Arunta and kindred tribes, the
Aluritcha and Urubunna, represent a far higher
culture than the desert blacks, the Wonkonguru,
Dieri, Uaurorki and the like. I am convinced in
my own mind that the last-mentioned are repre-
sentative of the indigenous abo. of Australia, and
that the Arunta and their kindred tribes obtained a
higher culture from the Melanesian and other people
who have from time to time landed in Australia.

“W.J.C.”: “Nitric” (B. 16/7/’25), com-
menting on “Jackeroo’s” query whether lucerne-fed
horses make a habit of gnawing the barks of trees,
suggests that his own horses —corn- and chaff-fed—
chew poplar bark to supplement their normal diet,
which, he considers, lacks some essential constituent.
“Jackeroo’s” horse chews willow bark as a definite
dessert, and not because he has had only lucerne;
for the bark is fairly rich in tannins and a glucosidal
body, salicin. Salicin, in contact with saliva,
has a taste which appeals to a prad’s palate. Willow
A SEER.
THE RUIN : “It’s useless for me to tell you what I want. [?]”
THE LADY: “However did you know I was out of soap?”
bark, by the way, was cnee used extensively in
medicinal preparations for rheumatism and ague on
account of its constituents, although salicin, chief
of these, has now largely pushed it off the scrip
list on account of its greater certainty of dose
measurement. “Nitric’s"’ bronchos lack nothing in
their diet, for corn and chaff give proteins, fats,
starch, mineral salts and all three vitamines ; and
such a diet falls short of none of the essential food
factors as determined by most recent biochemical
research. From poplar bark, his horses would get
an amount of tannin too small to taste, and minute
amounts of mucilage and starch insufficient to
tickle their palates. I am forced to the conclusion
therefore that “Nitric’s” horses were using his orna-
mental vegetables merely to sharpen their teeth.

“ Jim Carew”: “Lexel” (B. 23/7/’25) is
concerned over finding a platypus near Wiseman’s
Ferry, Hawkesbury River (N.S.W.). He needn’t be.
They are not at all uncommon in the upper fresh-
water reaches of the Hawkesbury, and are more
plentiful still in the upper waters of the Macdonald,
a short river which junctions with the Hawkesbury
at Wiseman’s.
* * * »
“X2X”: Little seems to be known scienti-
fically concerning the extraordinary species of fish
found in the subterranean streams of Australia, some
of which occasionally appear in the water of artesian
bores. Others sometimes turn up in deep mountain
creeks, showing an undoubted connection between
these streams and subterranean ones in the vicinity.
The fish are small, and composed of a peculiar, jelly-
like tissue, often transparent or semi-transparent in
places. Some varieties have protruding eyes, such as
are possessed by fish living at a great depth and
under enormous pressure, while others have no eyes
at all and appear to be completely blind, not even
being equipped with feelers to take the place of the
missing organs. Dissection reveals the majority to be
non-vascular, there being no signs in their bodies
of anything resembling blood-vessels. A nervous
system seems to be similarly lacking. What kind
of eating they make is unknown, but it is said that
the aboriginals of N.Q. include them in their diet with
special relish. They seem to be a form of life
different from the majority of other kinds on the
globe, and probably are as low down in the scale
separating the organic from the inorganic world as
it is possible to be.
* * * *•
“Buttenderry” : I do not find the bushman
who spoke disparagingly of gum-leaves so incompre-
hensible as “L.E.” (B. 16/7/’25) apparently did.
Most men who settle in forest country appreciate
the beauty of gums—when growing on the other
fellow’s country; but, as grass is absolutely essential
to a grazier, the trees have to give way. Nor do I
think it surprising that a man who has waged
war on the gums (and what a constant, stubbornly-
contested warfare it is!) comes to regard them with
disfavor. Four years ago I ring-barked a 20-aere
paddock, and each successive year I have gone over
the same ground knocking off suckers and grubbing
saplings. Even now I can see a dense swaying mass
of gorgeous variegated leaves beckoning me to the
fifth and, I hope, final round. Next year that 20-
acre paddock will probably grow some grass, but,
should I decide to cultivate it, the real tussle will
begin. By using a forest-devil and quantities of
gelignite, by working long hours, delving, chopping
and burning off, I’ll eventually beat the gums at the
rate of somewhere about an acre a month ; but it will
be only a temporary victory. Other men of an
older generation have gone through the same struggle,
in these parts, and some of the cultivation paddocks
which they so laboriously cleared are again ringing
with the sound of axe and cross-cut, to yield thou-
sands of pit-props. How the tough old gums must
laugh!
*■*■*«>
“Wancliai”: “Pambo” Eades, who tells
visitors to the Melbourne Zoo all they want to know
about Australian wrigglers, recently returned from
South Australia with two snakes of a species hitherto
unidentified. They were captured at Malang, are
very active, and are, it is thought, more venomous
than the death-adder. The strangers are colored bright
yellow on the back and sides, with regular green
markings throughout, and dull beneath. They
show much in common with the yellow cobra, and
even exhibit signs of a cupped hood when ruffled.
Ti.e fact that Kraaft made no reference to this par-
ticular species suggests that it was unknown to him.
* * * *
“Buttenderry”: I don’t think there is any-
thing in the suggestion to end up posts the way
they grew. Of course, capillary attraction does
operate in dead timber, but the moisture seems to
travel just as freely in one direction as the other.
“W.Y.N.” (B. 9/7/’25) can convince himself of
this by taking a small slip of wood, breaking it and,
reversing one half, standing both in ink. He will note
that the liquid travels up each half at about the same
rate. It is the knowledge of this , law that has
rendered dry-farming possible, and though most
farmers are aware that harrowing tends to conserve
the moisture in the soil, not all are cognisant of
the reason —the breaking up of the microscopic
capillaries, whereby the water is prevented from;
coming to the surface and evaporating.

“Trevdee”: Herb Blight, of Beulali (Vic.),
mast be the world’s champion wheat-bag sewer, and
there is local money to back him to do the seem-
ingly impossible number of 800 bags per day. He
threads his own needles, puts 13 stitches in each
time, and properly fills every bag. One morning durl
ing last harvest he did 350 bags ; then, after taking
an hour for lunch and a midday nap, he drove' five
miles to another farm and got through another 350
before knock-off time.
* * * •
“Bill Bowyang”: I hasten to support
“Lily Beale” (B. 16/7/’25) in her warning not to
make pets of the brolga or native-companion. This
bird, although easily reared and domesticated, is a
very dangerous pet about the house, as it will pluck
a child’s eye out in a moment. I know of one
instance where a N.Q. selector’s daughter, about three
years of age, lost one of her eyes in this way. The
brolga was reared from an egg hatched by a turkey
and became a pet round the house. One evening
the child was sitting on the front verandah, and
as the bird was passing it reached out its long
neck and plucked the right eye from the little
girl’s head.
* * * *
“V.E.”: Several variations of the porcu-
pine anteater (Echidna aculeata ) exist, distinguished
chiefly by differences in coloration. The N. S.
'Wales pore, is almost invariably a dark brown,
■ merging 1 into almost black in some examples, but
i the Tas. variety is a yellowish brown, and the
pores, found among the arid hills of Centralia
lighter still, with the spine tips brown instead of
black. The pore, turned up pretty early in the
history of Australia, for Bass and Flinders, when
at Twofold Bay (N.S.W.), early in 1800, recorded
that their dogs found one and could make
no impression on the animal, which burrowed
into loose sand, and so escaped. Some years
later two French naturalists picked up an echidna
at Hobart Town and kept it for some time in
captivity. Eventually—according to its captors—
the animal died through “washing itself too much.”
* * * *
“Anaf” : What must be a record in fecun-
dity lias been established by a Jersey cow owned
by Major P. Connolly, of Congola, South Coast
(N.S.W.). Born in 1911, she had her first calf when
slightly under 18 months old, and since then has
calved on 14 other occasions, besides being due for
another calf in a few weeks’ time. Of her entire
offspring, 11 were heifers, it seeming to be a
rule in such cases of fecundity that the majority
of the offspring are of the female sex. The cow
herself is still milaing.
* » * *
“Up North”: A cheerily noisy, socialistic
sort of cuss is the shining starling. He hangs out
in far N.Q. and travels in mighty flocks that some-
times darken the sky. When increasing the popu-
lation many of them club together and build in the
one big tree. They are very talkative when stripping
the palm fibre for building purposes, and get quite
excited when their big, finely-built nests are nearing
completion. Some colonies build so closely that
there is hardly talking room between the nests.
Immediately you get out of Stucky’s Gap on to
the Bloomfield Plain, you can, on a gentle morning,
hear easily the colony settled there, a mile away.
If you ride over to say the time o’ day, it’s like
walking into a mighty overstocked aviary when
the young birds are home. You can’t hear your-
self breathe. When you’re under the communal
tree you notice that many of the nests are blown
down and the ground is thickly carpeted with the
remains of partly-eaten fruit. You don’t stay there
long, because the fruit swarms with minute red
ticks that climb up your legs and bore under the
skin to give you “scrub itch,” which is indeed
the very devil.
“Tamornie”: In the sago swamps extend-
ing from the mouth of the Sepik along the New 1 Guinea
coast to the mouth of the Ramu and down to Hansa
Bay, mosquitoes are so thick that the natives carry
whisks made of the feathers of the cassowary, and
keep them continuously employed. Sleeping bags
are used throughout this area. Some are of huge
dimensions and, distended by cane hoops, accommo-
date a whole family at night-time. Fire is taken into
these bags on a bit of pottery to be used for pipe or
cigarette lighting. They are as closely woven as a
rice mat, and in some cases are similar in texture;
consequently the state of the atmosphere inside can
be imagined. It is the duty of the last entrant to
fold the mouth of the bag under and use this portion
as a pillow, thus preventing the ingress of the pests.
TEMPORARILY OUT OF ACTION.
“Sorry to hear about the wife's illness—not
dangerous, I hope?”
“Well — er—um, no. She's too ill to be
dangerous.”
“Hayeworray”: Whoever hears now of
the old bush-barometer ? Twenty-five years ago the
unfailing test for coming rain was the limpness of
a bunch of seaweed that was religiously kept in
every bush kitchen. I’ve seen it miles beyond
Bourke (N.S.W.), and still further inland. Another
old custom that is going out as fast as the jackeroo
is the hanging of green boughs as a foil for flies,
both in farmhouses and butchers’ shops.
SKULLS.
[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
“His mission is skulls, and he spoke enthusiastically
about some of the skulls he had seen in Australian
museums.” —Press item.
Earth’s spaces fonts of pleasure hold
In infinite variety:
For some there is adventure bold.
For others gay society.
To east and west, across the wave,
Are isles of gold-and-greenery
Where tourists yearly go to rave,
Enraptured of the scenery.
For me the world is never dull
Wherever I can find a skull.
Rich feasts of reason and of, soul
Wait those whose tastes aesthetic are,
The Davis Cup may be the goal
Of persons who athletic are.
There’s love to set the heart a-beat
And stir the pulses thrillingly
When warm eyes glow, and lips full sweet
Pant for hot kisses willingly:
1 hold them empty things and null
Beside the rapture in a skull.
Why not? Within this osseous dome
Of mine, my thought’s profundity—
All that I value has its home,
It holds the world’s rotundity
In miniature. And, so I find,
As science says, is fit to me,
Traced in the case of human mind
All human life’s epitome.
My deepest ecstasy I cull
From contemplation of a skull.

WHAT’S the use of liv-
ing if a man mustn’t
smoke as often as he
feels like it —or take a drink
when he’s thirsty? You might
as well be a slave!
The right kind of drink never
hurt a man yet —nor the
right kind of smoking; and
the right kind of smoking
can be summed up in two
words, “Matured tobacco.”
When you mature tobacco
for at least 3 years in the
wood you take away from
it all impurities, all harsh-
ness and bitterness, and if
you want to preserve your
health take my advice and
smoke nothing but matured
tobacco.

Every shade of brown, tan and crossings
thereof were feminine fancies at Caulfield on
Saturday, when the final of the Australian
Steeplechase meeting was the special offer-
ing of the V.A.T.C. The day had all the
brightness of early spring plus a frostiness
which whispered “Furs !” The new season’s
coat-frock in every hue of self-toned material,
with blendings of floral marocain or fancy
silks, was seen out walking with the usual
pushed-on-to-the-eyebrow headpiece; and
while fuchsia and brown hues had a run for
first place, with black a couple of lengths in
the rear, there seemed to be but few also-
rans of any other tones. There was
almost _ a vacuum where the aristo-
cracy is customarily found, the vice-
regal pen not being tenanted, though
the usual committee members’ fair folk occu-
pied their own particular sheepwalk in front
of the stand. The smartest bit of dressing
was featured by “an unplaced” of the social
writers, the fair unknown wearing black
of the two-piece mode, which had collar and
cuffs of ruckled black and white georgette
and diamond shapes thereof upon the skirt.
A version of the ensemble dressing appeared
also in black with cape attached to a top-
piece patterned in Chinese embroidery of
powder blue and pink. The young set —hun-
dreds of them, all snipped out upon a “hand-
me-down” pattern, all slim and all displaying
much fancy crossword-puzzle hose —aired
tailor-mades of wrap-over skirt and short
one-buttoned coat, with close-fitting colored
headpiece showing tufts of hair over each
ear—’tis a wise parent who can select her
own offspring these days from a bunch of
the modern buds. Lady Hennessy viewed the
gee-gees in a coat of mole over black frock-
ing and black millinery; daughter Valerie
brightened squirrel fur with a hat of cosmos
mauve; Mrs. Weston Pett’s all-black turn-
out had uplift in touches of ermine; Mollie
Kyan was a pastelle study in navy and amber
plaid allied to beige millinery; and Airs.
Rogers Thomson was smartly uniformed in
tan cloth. A fowlhouse had been raided to
supply the trimming for a navy coat and
skirt, collared and cuffed with dull green and
red coque feathers.
The U.S. Fleet officers one-stepped their
swansong at the Admiral’s ball, which occu-
pied all the dancing space of the Pennsyl-
vania, Oklahoma and Nevada. Flags, lanterns,
gum-tips and wattle hid the martial aspects
of the trinity. The hosts had broadcast
invitations wholesale into the democratic
ether, and there was more lass than mascu-
line knee to sit upon. In the crush the Atlas
moths of high society had their down rubbed
off against typists, sales-ladies and other
lesser lepidoptera. “Quaite as bad form, m’
dear,” panted one stout dame, wedged be-
tween a ventilator and a vane, “as the Admi-
ral making merry at a party for gobs.” The
visitors for the most part did the rounds of
flic trio of battleships tethered to Prince’s
Pier, over which the moon shed a special
radiance for the occasion. A special attrac-
tion after midnight on the Pennsylvania was
a baptism of confetti fired from the big guns.
It would be easier to enumerate the politi-
cal, professional, naval, military and social
taipans who were not present than give a
list of those that were; and the frocking
was largely that with which we are already
well acquainted—even the brightest of press-
women has been unable to disguise in her
descriptions the gowns which have braved
the radiance of a score of previous hops.
Tearful farewells were many, but by lunch-
time next day local masculine noses were be-
ing straightened; and now the girls have
ceased to wonder who is kissing the U.S.
Navy.
So far the only maiden to annex a pros-
pective husband among the officers of the
Murcan Fleet is pretty Nancy Best, who
almost tripped straight from school info the
arms of her loot at her first ball, the Golden
Pacific. The lass who wears the badge of
the engaged is the daughter of Mr. and Mrs.
E. L. Best, of South Kew, and a niece of
the Robert Best pair. The happy man is
Lieutenant Julian Wheeler, one of the navi-
gating officers of the Nevada, who hails from
Alabama of the coon song.
The streets bloomed tawny wattle to the
music of rattling collection-boxes shaken
by battalions of maids and matrons
on Friday. Flower-stalls uprose over-
night at every street corner to swell
the fund that has as its interest
the poor and sick amongst the children.
Mayoress Brunton was at her post at the
Town Hall for the Carlton Creche. Singers
showroom at the Block Arcade was a flower-
show which netted over £3OO for the cause,
and the Anglican Cathedral ground was an-
other buccaneering centre whose loot goes
to the Church of England Kindergarten and
homes.
People who had entertained the Americans
were yarded in return on the Pennsylvania,
Oklahoma and Nevada for an afternoon re-
ception and a ball. The Pennsylvania being
the grand piano of the Fleet, society clus-
tered round it until some diplomat mur-
mured, “Better tea on the Nevada.’’
Souchong, iced fruit-cup, wafers, olives and
devilled almonds —the only deviltry—were
dry America’s offerings, while the same folk
as have haunted every jollo roamed the decks
and asked their guides if the elegant mahog-
any apparatus for supplying air to divers
was the ship’s ice-chest. Mrs. Coontz hov-
ered around with chick Bertha and niece
Frances gathered under her sable plumage.
Mrs. Weston Pelt and Mrs. Rogers Thom-
son were successful exponents of the black
satin ensemble suit, and Mrs. Fleming Dun-
stan revealed a charming fawn and green
silk jersey and pleated georgette under a
wrap-over coat. The Robert Wilkins pair,
Robert Garran and his lady, Miss Bentwick.

Stanley and Walter Kirby helped to brighten

by the bleak expanse of Prince’s Pier.
Lee White adorns “Back Again” with some
stunning upholstery. A sheathing of green
chiffon velvet has crystal headings and mauve
and ivory touches. Cosmos pink with dashes
of cerise jewelled in blue and crystal is the
specification of another elaborate creation,
round which the lady of the radiant smile
and husky notes waves feather fans of varied
hues.
The gaieties of the just-concluded frenzy
were so multitudinous that long before the
Fleet had flitted nerves became frayed and
entertainers and entertainees weary. At the
Fleet’s return reception, a maiden, in speak-
ing of the hectic time she had gone through,
absent-mindedly remarked to one of the
hosts, “I shall be glad when they leave.”
“You don’t say,” calmly he replied ; and then
the lass woke up.
A product <>f the war days is that ener-
getic body of girls at Swallow and Ariell’s
factory who style themselves the Busy Bees.
Under their able leader, Elsie Holmes, they
did rare work, and, finding it to their liking,
looked for a fresh avenue for their talents in
the Peace. The other day they sent to the
Foundling Hospital and Infants’ Home. •in
Berry-street, 63 woollen nighties, for which
their firm donated the material. Two hun-
dred lucky-bags were included in a parcel
for this committee’s Wattle Day stall. The
Port Melbourne Free Kindergarten’s stall on
that day overflowed with cretonne aprons
made by the same clever fingers, and further-
assistance was given by the sale of buttons.
Veritably these lassies are well named.
Thanks to the inventiveness of Miss Lilian
Pitts, demi-semiquavers, crotchets and clefs
need have no
further terrors
for beginners
in the hard art
of music, and
teachers should
bless the lady
whose ingenu-
ity makes
smooth the
c o n t rapuntal
path even for
the infant tod-
dler. The de-
monstrator she
has devised in
her home in
M errigu m,
Vic., may be
w orkc d on
desk, black-
board or even
nursery floor,
requires n o
cutting an d
pasting, and can be used again and again.
The lady is at present giving an interesting
exposition of her scheme at Paling’s, Sydney.
Mrs. Eggleston, wife of the State Attorney-
General, has had the courage to come into
the open and express the hope that no drastic
legislation will be passed to hamper herbal-
ists. She signed a petition as a patient of
a herbalist. If statements current in high
official circles can be credited, a leader of
society, who can command the best medical
and surgical skill in Australia, consulted a
Chinese herbalist a few months ago when a
member of her family was seriously ill, but
the non-medical practitioner said that the
patient was “too far gone." He declared
that had he been given a chance a few months
earlier he would have saved the precious
one’s life. This sort of attitude won't make
it easy for Dr. Argyle to get through his
anti-quackery bill.
Findon Harriers had a Hunt Club rally
at Moonee Valley course the other day. The
smart tailor-made suit of the lass who clears
the timber in pursuit of the brush was re-
peated in the general wear of the represen-
tatives of the racing clans who sauntered
upon the lawns. Mrs. Jim Fairbairn touched
up a black ensemble suit with squirrel fur
and jetted millinery. Mrs. Fred Grimwade
was lamenting, in red and grey check and
a black hat, a diamond pendant lost at Fed-
eral Government House ball —it has since
been retrieved. Miss Aileen Dowling, Nell
Wimpole, Lorna Hiskens and Betty Fair-
bairn were of the trim coats and hats.
Even starting with the assumption that
the Government can do nothing right, one
hardly expected the grand finale to the Fleet
film compiled by the authorities to be a gob
kissing with indiscreet enthusiasm an Aus-
tralian girl. On the green outside Luna
Park, St. Ivilda, is the location of the
incident. Even as a snapshot for a pri-
vate album it would hardly be in the
very best of taste. The film had its first
private screening to an all-invitation audi-
ence at the Capitol one morning last week,
when Prime Minister Bruce patted the Gov-
ernment on the back for the excellence of
the thing. There is nothing wrong with
the photography, but a lot more interesting
incidents of the U.S. Navy’s visit have been
seen in non-flicker form in the dailies.
Familiar to many Diggers is this lady of
the decorations C.8.E., R.R.C. She is Sister
Grace Wilson,
the recently-
elected presi-
dent ot' the lie-
turned Army
Nurses’ Club
atAn z a o
House. A
whole fi v e
years of war
service stand
to her credit;
she was
matron of the
3rd AG.II. at
Lemnos, was
in Egypt and
France, and
wa s acting-
matron - in-
chief in Lon-
don. Sister
Wilson learnt
to take tem-
peratures in
Brisbane General Hospital. With Sister
Greig she now conducts Somerset House
Hospital, Melbourne.
Hugh Ward is knocking a nail into the
vestibule of the Princess to hang the illumi-
nated tribute he received, along with a silver
cigar-box at the hands of Lady Forster, from
the Friendly Union of Soldiers’ Wives and
Mothers the other day. It was Hugh's habit
of admitting soldiers’ old folk to full-dress re-
hearsals that inspired the presentation. Mrs.
Ward collected a posy, and of the listeners-
in were the Chauvel and Howse ladies, Mrs.
S. M. Bruce and Senator and Mrs. Pearce.
The Lyceum Club staged the other night
a welcome to Chuhaldin. the Russian violin-
ist ; it was arranged by the Melbourne Music
Club. Hon. secretary Muriel Campbell host-
essed the full house. Chuhaldin, who had
already appeared at the Uni. symphony
orchestral concert the previous night, played
with beautiful tone pieces by Saras ate,
Tschaikowsky and himself. Harold Elvms
was at the keyboard. In f rocking of
white satin, Constance Burt raised sweet
notes, and Gwen Proctor gracefully drew
her bow across her ’cello. Noticed in the
gathering were Mrs. Barden, Fritz Hart,
Mrs T. C. Brennan, Mal-y Campbell and the
Edgar Warwick pair—they are managing the
violinist’s tour.
Tara Hall, the stately home _of Thomas
O’Loghlin in Studley-road, Kew, is in mourn-
ing for its amiable mistress. The joy ot
spending £lOO,OOO out of his big pile to build
a church in Kilkenny, in the Onld Sod, as
a memorial to his late dad, a Ballarat
pioneer, was nothing to T.J. as compared
with being married in the building in 101 l
to Kathleen Murphy, daughter of one of the
country gentry. In recognition of his many
benefactions, T.J. was made a Papal Count
some years ago. Two bishops, 100 priests
and a crowded congregation assisted at the
requiem at the Sacred Heart Church, Kew.
Five daughters comprise the family which
T. will now have to mother as well as
father. _
At the pretty Moouee Valley course the
other day the geegees ran in the cause of
charity, the beneficiary being the Womens
Hospital. The attendance was good, but
the dresses were as the weather, dull. Mrs.
\ V Hiskens. president of the hospital,
wore black with light fur collar and black
millinery touched with gold. Mrs. James
Vis ton wore a kolinsky coat over her navy
suit. Mrs. Arthur Mould. Mrs. V J.
Earle, Mrs. D. A. Skene and Mrs. J. L.
McArthur were amongst the sports.
Philanthropists took time off from Fleet
farewellings to attend the annual launder-
ing of Queen Victoria Hospital affairs, pre-
sided over by Lady Stradbroke. From a
free and bumble dispensary for women and
children, established by three women doc-
tors 25 years ago, the thing has grown into
a great temple of healing for women and
babes, officered by the fair sex. A new block
of buildings is arising which will allow of
2000 in-patients to be cared for yearly. Out
patients the past 12 months numbered over
7000. Mayor Brunton, Dr. Georgina Sweet,
Dr. Margaret McLorinan and Dr. Constance
Ellis were of the afternoon’s speakers. Mrs.
Norman Brookes is president of the com-
mittee, of which Mrs. J. Sutherland is lion,
secretary.
The Hon. Mrs. Robert Lindsay and daugh-
ters Joyce and Rosemary are helping to
count the new lambs at the station home of
Mr. and Mrs. Reginald Power at Albury.
Later the trio go on to Sydney, and then pack
trunks for the Great Smoke once more.
The- cosy interior of the club-house at
Kooyong, home of Victoria’s Lawn Tennis
Association, blossomed with wattle, jonquils
and Iceland poppies in honor of the now
fleeting Fleet, one day last week. Vera de
Bavay, whose frocking was rose-pink em-
broidered in crystal and gold, arranged the
flowers. Mr. and Mrs. Jim Fairbairn, Miss
Alice Cussen, arrayed in petunia pink geor-
gette, and Mrs. Frank Major, who scintii
lated in sequined black, were of the gathering.
Mrs. Harry Emmerton, off holidaying
shortly with her husband to the Yeast, is
being bidden to several farewell tea infusings.
The Windsor Hotel staged one engineered by
Mrs. Groom, who was in nutmeg and brown
fur, allied to a black velvet headpiece, and Mrs.
Herbert Hewlett, who touched up black with
red. The guest of honor, in all black and an
ospreyed hat, was au revoired by some of
Melbourne’s smartest. There were Mrs. H.
M. Bruce, a study in autumn forest tones:
Mrs. Norman Brookes, coated in black satin
with a hat of beige hue; Mrs. Colin Fraser,
airing ecru lace upon a black ensemble suit;
Jessie Groom, in red crepe de Chine with
a black satin hat; and Nancy Hewlett, a
stanza in mole and brown. Mrs. Coontz
and her daughter were of the invited.
Some units of the TJ.S. Navy invaded the
home of Mr. and Mrs. R. J. Burroughs at
Brighton Beach the other night by invita-
tion. The guests danced in a marquee be-
I decked with colored lights. The hostess, in
I saxe-blue chenille, embossed with golden-
browny velvet, extended, with her hubby
and son, welcome to about 100. Mr. and
Mrs. Howard Jolley—she in draperies of
green and gold; the R. Wittmann pair, Irma
Wittmann, Mr. and Mrs. A. W. Allen, Misses
Allen, Mr. and Mrs. E. C. Ludbrook and Dr.
Bartolini were of the invited.
An Adelaide postscript:—
The excellent Conservatorium String Quartet has
given its last concert tor this yean, and what may be its
last concert altogether unless some support is guaran-
teed for next season. This year’s three concerts —all
of them delightful—have been run at a loss, and the
suggested remedy is an Adelaide Chamber Music
Society with a membership of at least 125. It is
not an exacting demand to make on a community
which prides itself on being composed almost ex-
clusively of musical highbrows. We have also had
the third of the State Orchestra’s concerts. For
the first time a vocalist was included in the. pro-
gramme—-Yalda Harvey, whose “Elizabeth’s Greeting
to the Hall of Song” came with the final “Tann-
hauser” overture and was richly sung.
Feminine members of the Country party, headed by
Mrs. J. H. Chapman and Mrs. W. G. Mills, spread
luncheon at the South Australian for Mrs. Earle
Page and her daughter as they passed through.
Another amateur musical comedy is to be staged
for charity—at the Royal in November next. The
comedy is “Yvonne,” which has already won tire
approval of Agnes Murphy arid of London producers.
Edith Ail'd is responsible for the libretto and Jack
Fewster and Tom King for the music. Nora Stewart
is undertaking the ballets, there is to be special
scenery, and Enid Bosanko —she sang with the Allan
Wilkie Co. —will play the lead, with Charles Langley
and Ray and Herbert Walsh among- her supports.
The anniversary of the outbreak of the war brings
some sharp reminders. From the Red Cross Society
comes a plea for cardigans for men in hospital badly
needing them —the society provides the wool if knitters
will supply the fingers —and the committee of the
Army Nurses’ Fund, which has spent in the last 12
’months £750 in hospital and convalescent home
fees, pensions to disabled nurses and fees for post-
war training, finds each year the demands on its
resources grow heavier. The Returned Soldiers’
Association has added to its club rooms a mural
tablet commemorative of women’s work in the war,
and it was unveiled by the association’s president,
Major McCann, recently. He said that since the
Armistice the ladies’ elbows had not slackened; but
this is only true of some. There must be a good
many knitting-pins lying idle that could take on
the cardigans.
The Palais was dolled up like a Christmas cracker
on Friday night, when about 80 guests one-stepped
at Mrs. Walter Murray’s invitation. The Murray
clan is a big one, and has intermarried with others
almost as big, so that there was a thick sprinkling
of Angas, Bowman, Ashwin, Melrose and Fotheringham
nieces, nephews, cousins and aunts. Mrs. Murray
stood up in midnight blue georgette, and her younger
daughter was in daffodil yellow. Miss Murray’s be-
crystalled green marked its waist with flowers of pink
and gold.

DELCO
WE mortals are largely creatures of environment—in gloomy
surroundings we are discontented, unhappy—in bright,
cheerful surroundings we radiate happiness.
Two of the main factors in the making of a brighter home are the
furnishing and light, principally light, for the furnishings lose most
of their attractiveness in rooms which are dull and gloomy.
The DELCO-LIGHT home is a home transformed. Your wife
and children, your friends and yourself will revel in the added
brilliance—clear, clean light, ready at the touch of a finger on a
button.
Your wife will have more leisure and will find a new zest in
entertaining her friends, because she will know that her
Delco-lighted home is being shown off to best advantage.
Your children will grow up in an atmosphere of bright, happy
evenings that will live long in their memories.
You yourself will be happy with the knowledge that electric irons,
vacuum-cleaners, dish-washers, etc., have banished the drudgery
of the home.
Electric Light is much the best artificial light, and DELCO-LIGHT
is the best electric light and power plant—simple, efficient and
economical.

On Thursday morning the American Fleet
kilted her Quaker-grey skirts and made for
the Heads. Between the clear blue of the
sky and the blue sparkle of the waters the
warships moved wi.th an effect at once de-
mure and deprecating. Of course, they had
left broken hearts behind, but then that is
the toll of the Navy the Seven Seas around.
And, anyway, weren’t they feeling a little
down-hearted themselves? From Bradley’s
Head, Kirribilli, the Domain and all the way
to Watson’s Bay Sydney watched its new-
old friends sail out of its life, and waved
while there was yet a blur on the skyline.
Then it made its way back to a city strangely
uninhabited without the moving hosts of
white-capped gobs.
The young American bluejacket entered the
canteen before 9 o’clock on the eve of his
departure. With an air of utter despondency
ho sank into a seat, and with lack-lustre
eyes gazed at the helper who was serving
him with coffee. “What’s the matter?’’ asked
the kind-hearted girl. “Nothing,” replied the
gob, dropping a tear into his cup, “onlv
I've got to leave my goil.” “Oh, cheer up,”
urged the canteen-worker, “you’ll get an-
other in Auckland.” “I know,” responded
the boy lugubriously, “that’s just it—and
have all this misery to go through again. It
always is my luck to fall in love!”
The canteen, by the way, really has done
remarkable work. The younger men par-
ticularly clung to it with fond tenacity.
There were concerts almost every night
under Bertie Kelly’s management, and there
were always some songs on the bill that
simply demanded that everybody should join
m the chorus. Anthony Horderns’ welfare
worker, . Miss Armstrong, went night after
night with a band of helpers—the girls had
mostly been working in shops and offices
all day themselves, but they gave up their
leisure cheerfully. “We’d like somebody to
look after our young brothers,” was reason
enough for them to add half a working day
to their already crowded eight hours.
Mayoress Cecilia Walsh caught one of the
final, rays of Fleet glory to brighten up her
tair in aid of the new deaf and dumb hostel.
Dated for the day before the U.S. Navy’s
departure, it had the exhilarating music from
the band of the Colorado to make spending
seem as good as a one-step. Premier Lang
made one of his rare public appearances to
declare the function open, and Gaud Mayor
Stokes and Knight Henry Braddon supported
him with more or less heavy artillery of
speech. The Chief Justice Street lady "was
one of the principal conspirators in the good
cause; and Sydney’s own Nell Stewart sold
mercery with an unexpected and disarming
cunning. By a curious irony the wife of ex-
Attorney-General Tom Bavin, who is loathed
by lottery-promoters, was in charge of the
lucky dips. The lieaped-up gold of spring
flowers was the glory of the afternoon.
Even the Rose Bay Golf Club ball suffered
the general blight last Wednesday when it
jazzed its farewell to Uncle Sam’s Navee.
The affair had been held over from the pre-
vious week in order to snare a full comple-
ment of cocked hats, and, like a souffle that’s
not served at the precise moment, it had
gone flat. Lots of the visitors had to re-
join their ships by midnight, and by lialf-
-12 the golf-house looked like the original
of Tom Moore’s banquet-hall deserted. But
up till midnight the rooms, warm with fire-
glow and massed with poppies and wattle,
were crammed to capacity, and the verandahs
had to be requisitioned for dancing. The
vice-reine, in greens the shade of Deirdre’s
cloak, brought daughter Elaine, in two tones
ot pink. Judge Rolin’s lady emerged radiant
out ot a foam of rosy georgettes, and Chief
Justice Adrian Knox’s lady mingled the purry
sleekness of black satin and grey fur. Edith
Hill’s greys and mauves stood up to the
judgment of Paris intrepidly, and pretty
Nancy Marsden’s white georgettes blossomed
into almond greens in u distracting fashion.
The American Consular Lawtons brought a
party which included the A. C. Berk couple
and their daughter. Mrs. Audette. Add to
these the Knoxs, the Brun tons, Horderns,
Levys and Fairfaxes, all wearing the utter-
most feather of their war-paint, and that’s
a flashlight of Rose Bay saying good-bai to
the Stars and Stripes.
Dora Wilcox’s Maori play, “Aroha,” got
an airing the other night within the sacred
precincts of the Lyceum Club. The play,
which is poetic rather than dramatic, got a
great hand from the audience, which, for a
Wonder, showed a heavy sprinkling of Man.
Except for a unanimous decision among the
readers never to pronounce a Maori word
twice the same way, the reading went well.
But when the chorus read out, “Enter group
of Maori maidens, their hair wreathed with
flowers, dancing lightly and singing,” one of
the four M.M.’s, who were sitting frozen
almost stiff on their chairs, burst into a
giggle that sounded clear as the tinkle of
glass across the room. “Aroha” should make
an interesting stage-production.
Youth was at the spring without a doubt
at the Ambassadors the other night. With
800 people trying to dance at the same
moment those ones who sprang the fastest
got the floor space—the slower movers got
the humps. The occasion was the ball in aid
of the Santa Sophia College within the Uni.,
and to such purpose had the committee
worked under the impetus of that whirlwind
of a young man Rupert Markham that the
building fund must show quite a comfortable
credit. Mayor Stokes squired his acting-
Mayoress to the ball. She Avas president of
the. committee, of which Eileen Stevens was
assistant-secretary and A.A. Markman treas-
urer.
Knight Owen Cox left for Europe at the
end of last week with niece Gladys Bonsor.
Everybody said good-bye in turkey and
truffle, and at one valedictory banquet at
the Australia the tables were thickly pat-
terned with deep crimson and pale pink
roses, intertwined with a broad purple rib-
bon. Ex'-Priminister Billy Hughes, ex-
Premier Fuller, Arthur Rickard and Consett
Stephen were the speakers. In the gallery
overlooking the party Mrs. William Maeleod
entertained Miss Bonsor at a dinner of the
small and intimate variety. This will be
Owen Cox's first visit to Europe since 1914.
His famous establishment at Castle Hill is
looking for a new master. His flat at Dar-
ling Point is to be the town homo of the
newly-wedded Martins—-she was Alison
MacCormick.
The Women’s Country Club buzzed like a
hive of bees on Friday when the members
foregathered to welcome their president, Mrs.
Earle Page, just returned from a tour of
the world. From the smartness of Ottoman
and sable, the Treasurer’s lady talked in-
terestingly of the woman voter in many coun-
tries. Earle Page himself smiled on the
gathering of his party’s faithful, and the big
act of the afternoon was the handing over
by Mrs. Foster Mattei of a very gold and
bine illuminated address. The afternoon was
further memorable for the unleashing of the
three remarkable voices which belong to
Virginia Bassetti, Mavis Dearman and
Gwladys Edwards, from Perth.
Mrs. Cyril Gunther, known in her Uni.
days as Jean Thomson —she is a daughter of
Dr. Thomson,
of Brisbane—
had a brilliant
career at Syd-
ney Univer-
sity, from
w hic h she
emerged M.B.
and Cli.M. She
was one of the
“Five Peas in
a Pod,” paint-
ed by Tom
Roberts, which
hangs on the
Women’s Col-
lege walls;
and also one
of the first
women gradu-
ates to obtain
a hospital ap-
p o i ntment —
she retired
from the pro-
fession when she married the son of the late
Archdeacon Gunther. Her chief interests
nowadays, outside her home, are the Day
Nursery Association and the Cranbrook
School. The alert brain and sense of humor
of the lady here pictured make her invalu-
able as an organiser. Photo from New
Talma Studio.
Studies of leafy boughs and the vivid hues
of flowers, Alfred Coffey’s Javanese scenes,
Syd Long’s fascinating glimpse of the Hawkes-
bury, a graceful girl swinging a fan glow-
ing enough for Cleopatra’s service—all these
and more turned the galleries of the Educa-
tion Department into a place of cheerfulness
and grace on Saturday afternoon in spite of
the dour day without. The Royal Art Society
had again put on its best ties, girt its waist-
line, and invited its friends to pass judg-
ment on its year's work. The roll-up was the
usual dense slowly-moving mass of humans,
most of whom had to be content with a view
of the outline of other people’s garments rather
than one of the pictures. The State Viking,
with a peaty Arran Isle sort of Cardigan
tucked under his tweeds, opened the show,
which contains an extraordinarily good port-
rait of himself by Watson Balfour —though
he modestly refrained from eulogising this.
With him were Lady de Oliair and Elaine,
aided by Captain Coote. Dattilo Rubbo and
Charlie Bryant piloted the party through oil
and water, and the council gave them a tea
party, and with a final salaam caged them in
the down-dropping lift. Like all R.A.S.
shows, it was a friendly and intimate affair.
Charlie Banks was there* smiling still in
spite of not having his customary luck of
being a first-seller. Mary Edwards’ little
Chinee maid drew groups of admiring gazers:
two strangers from Maoriland —the Bowring
couple—dropped in and announced their in-
tention of dwelling in Sydney; the England
couple solaced young artists with weak tea
and sponge cage; and so many young men
mooched from canvas to canvas that it
seemed as if half the male population lived
by the brush alone.
The Royal Philharmonic Society will cele-
brate its 250th concert with a performance
of Coleridge Taylor’s “Hiawatha” in the
Town Hull on
the 19th. The
society’s char
ter goes back
to 1885, and
many Sydney-
ites can look
back to the
youthful days
wh e n they
sang in the
P h i 1 h a r-
monic choir,
even before
the time of the
late Signor
Hazon. “Hia-
watha” is
worthy of the
occasion, and
the new Con-
s e r v atorium
O rchestra
players will be
an added
strength. Norman L. Jan son, the original
of the accompanying portrait, will sing the
baritone solos, and Arthur Jordan is the
tenor. Norman, the society’s foremost bari-
tone and a very good Australian, comes from
the studio of W. Reginald Gooud. The photo
is by Judith Fletcher.
The naval depot at Rushcutter's Bay was
one of Saturday’s high lights. Here Com-
mander Leo Quick and his lady served jazz
with a kick in it to Sydney’s dancing 400.
Programmes and bunting and guns from the
Emden and the Australia added touches of
local color. Mrs. Quick did the honors
in skyey blues.
On Saturday night the State Excellencies
gave another of their musical evenings. Wil-
liam Heuglian was the star, and William
managed to pervade even a Government
House drawing-room with the tang of the
Highlands.
Two of the Kirkpatrick girls, of Logan
Brae, Bellevue Hill —they are daughters of
the late architect for the Commonwealth.
Bank —are flashing engagement-rings. Rita,
the singing one, murmured the right word to
Keith Nelson-King, of Surrey (England),
just about the same moment that Lily
Eugene, awjfy in Ceylon, was making Harold
Beaumont Applegate the happiest man in the
world. He is of Ceylon and Ohio.
Dorothea Spinney, who flashed her pea-
green stockings on Sydney’s gaze two years
ago, has since travelled round the world and
back again with Euripides. And though the
Greek dramatist has been rather dead for
some time, Dorothea breathes the breath of
life through him, and in the lines of Gilbert
Murray’s translations presents him as a
creature of living emotions. “Alcestis,”
“Medea,” “Electra” and other Gi'eek tra-
gedies will be unfolded by Dorothea of the
cloudy hair and the tragic voice at the Con-
servatorium. The University women gradu-
ates brewed an urn in honor of the lady, who
looked like the flesh-and-blood interpretation of
Shelley’s immortal Ode in white satin, cut
a la Sappho, while a circlet of myrtle leaves
bound her dark, mysterious tresses. Presi-
dent of the association Bernard Muscio and
Professor MacCallum welcomed the modern
interpreter of Euripides from a bunch of
notes with which, as in a paper chase, tliev
kept to the right track and finally reached
home, spent but victorious. Mrs. Muscio, in
a Chinese effect of black and gold, did the
honors.
Louis Becke’s wife and daughter Niya
have struck a pile of luck in London. Niya
is in charge of the bookshop in the Austra-
lian Court at Wembley, and has had some
poems and articles published in English
magazines. Mrs. Becke has received an
appointment in the N.S.W. office at Aus-
tralia House.
Trixie Tange, of the red gold topknot and
the clever keyboard fingers, is off with
mother next month for Vienna. Hard study
is Trixie’s objective, and critics expect that
the Sydney chrysalis will finally emerge one
of the world’s noted pianists. A product of
the State Conservatorium, Trixie was one
of the youngest to gain her professional per-
former’s diploma from that institution.
They tell this story of Admiral Rodman.
One Sunday in New York he took it into
his head to go to church, and his choice
rested on one of the most fashionable places
of worship in the city.. Entering just as the
service was about to begin, he stepped right
up the aisle and into one of the front pews.
It chanced to be tenanted by a small, fussy
man who, as the Admiral approached, pulled
a card out of his pocket, wrote thereon and
pushed it under the seaman’s gaze. The
note read : “I would like you to know that
1 rent this pew for 400 dollars a month.”
I he Admiral cast an eye of stern inspection
round the woodwork, thumbed the upholstery,
pulled out his own card and wrote: “It’s a
swindle! Not worth a dime more than 200.”
Secretary for St. Euke’s Mrs. Roystone
Davey, Who, with her husband, is enjoying an
exciting world tour as an interlude in a life
literally devoted to good works, drops a line
irom New York to say that all the gar-
m<LntSu.?re ? Ilort an( * slim to emaciation. If
a healthy Australian woman even glances at
them they begin to split their seams. Canada

presented by her mother-in-law, the Lady
Latymcr. The Hon. Mrs. Tom was Pat
Morey, daughter of General Sir Herbert and

Aus in her girlhood days. Another South
Australian presented was Mrs. Ryder Tange,
of , 2 ai £ ain Ryder Tange and daughter
of the late Hon Thomas King. Part of her
Pourt dress and her veil of Brussels lace
were worn by her mother when sweeping
curtsies in the days of Queen Victoria. Both
ladies are nieces of the late .T. Wheat-
Roberts, of Vaucluse.
Lily Bernard and Florence Hinton, the
Y eteranesses of Variety who have been
charming Sydney with the songs that were
the rage 30 or 40 years ago. have had lives
full of quaint adventure. Both have been
m the theatrical game since early childhood •
Inly started at eight years of age in a circus
in Pans, and Florence was practically on
the boards as soon as she could walk. Stage-
crart and ability, not “personality” and
type, earned success in the days when
they were headliners in the halls. There
were no lighting effects, and the curtain was
drawn back or up and down by cords, so you
depended on your make-up (and that was
often put on by candle-light) and the detail
pt your costume for your atmosphere. You
sang the same songs for two and three years
—.your audiences expected it. and jolly
audiences they were. Men—ladies didn’t
frequent the ’alls in those days—who dropped
m for a pipe and a drink and a chance to
in the choruses they liked best. Lily
Bernard went all through the English pro-
i inces. and half over Europe, oil her big
hit, “Two Little Girls in Blue”; and Flor-
ence gipsied equally far afield on “Mignon-
ette." Miss Hinton recalls the first night
of Glievalier’s real success. “Everybody was
glad,” she said; “it was like a personal tri-
umph.” Slim and attractive, a mixture of
French and Cockney, he had rather the air
of a grand duke even before he became a
popular idol.
Brisbane’s jottings:—
The smell of gum leaves pervades Queen-street and
the bushman is coming to town in battalions. Re-
union is the password, and nightly dances are the
symbol thereof. The South Brisbane City Hall was
turned into a bit of Old Japan in aid of the Catholic
Seamen’s Club, with wistaria-hung bridges, jewelled
with electric lights, Japanese flags and yellow tori.
Collins’s orchestra fiddled for 700 pairs of feet, and
Mrs. Tom Ryan, in mauve georgette, presented 16
debs, to Archbishop Duhig.
At Elsa Stralia’s concert in the Exhibition Build-
ing S’Matthew sent up a special request for “The
Song of Thanksgiving,” and the singer had to do
a record motor sprint back to her hotel to get the
music, while the rest of the company held the fort.
On the Sunday evening the Savage Club supped
Stralia and her following at the club rooms. Over
her shrimp pink gown, Madame wore a wonderful
Spanish shawl in red and green, and at the concert
she suited her dark eyes with black and lacquer-red.
Society, in its best bib and tucker and with vice-
regality in the van, swarmed to see the Repertory
Society commence its crusade against lowbrow enter-
tainment, with Milne’s “The Dover Road,” at the
Royal. Grizel Gibson, Alan Devereux and a brother
of Mary Macgregor were a surprise to those who
“don’t like amateur performances.” And the stage
effects were something for Barbara Sisley to be
proud of.
Exiles of the Shivery Isles clasped hands at a
reunion the M.L. Readings arranged in the Winter

Maorilanders were the Otleys and the Matsons and
Mrs. C. E. Sligo.
Doreen Lord said she would to Cyril Scott, of the

NOTIONS
Palbi (Eaton Lad —Pixie), who won both
Randwick steeplechases in June, did it again at
Moonee Valley, was third in the G. N. Steeple at
Flemington and second in the Moondah Steeple at
Caulfield, wound up a great jumping season (tor
him) with a sterling success in the £2lOO Aus-
tralian Steeple at Caulfield, about four miles.
There were only seven starters, and the prices were
rather remarkable for McShortodds: 3 to 1 Jupiter,
7 to 2 Roisel, 4’s Minterne, s’s Silver Heart and Palbi;
15’s Master Fife and 25’s Resembler. Also it was a
thrilling race. Minterne and Master Fife made,
most of the running, and Minterne, having shaken
the outsider off, looked to have the race m his
keeping, until he blundered at the sod wall the second
last obstacle —and came down. That left Silver
Heart with a good lead, but Palbi made up his
ground magnificently, and a spirited struggle over
Ihe last furlong resulted in Palbi getting the verdict
by a “short” half-head, with Jupiter third (he seemed
to be much closer than the official thiee lengths )
and Master Fife a poor fourth. Palbi, who was in the
rear most of the way, carried his 12st. ab. like
the champion he is. Neil McKenna trains him loi
Jock McKenzie, and Pearce rode a fine race lh<;
time (Bmin. 2sec.) was slow 7 , but it was pretty heavy
going. There was another exciting finish in the
Ivnowsley Steeple, Murrell, on Repatriation (4 s),
outwitting the rider of Welcome Stranger (7 s),and
getting there by a head. Old Pengane (6 s)
accounted for several boomed horses in the Bala-
clava Stakes, 11 furlongs, in which Valiant, who has
been backed for the Caulfield Cup, finished like a
non-stayer, and Sailing Home galloped as it he
had had enough of it for the time being.

Ararat (Rlankney II. — Fedan) has a par-
tiality for Moorefield; in fact, he seldom wins
anywhere else. His not very brilliant record on the
Turf includes seven victories at the Kogarah course.
The latest w 7 as gained in the Flying Handicap, six
furlongs, on Saturday; but if Woodville had been
permitted to sail along in front for most of the
journey, instead of being worried in that position
by Ballante, it would probably have been Woodville
first, Ararat second, instead of the other way about.
Ararat was favorite at 7 to 4. Amoums (Magpie—
Loved One), who is owned and trained by J. w.
Cook, ran away with the first three-vear-old handi-
cap of the season, a six-furlong sprint. He vyas
backed from 20’s to 7’s, and though he beat nothing
out of the ordinary, he finished in a style sugges-
tive of triumphs in more important races than
Moorefield flutters. Bovvalla (s’s) won the Moore-
field Handicap, 10 furlongs, from end to end, but
was hard pressed over the last 50 yards by game
little Cesarion Chip. P. B S hlkmer owns
Bovvalla, who is a four-year-old bay gelding by
Bowman —Florence Blanche.

At the Queensland Turf Club’s Exhibition
meeting at Eagle Farm, Admetus, who, for some
reason or other, wasn’t nominated for the Epsom,
again demonstrated that he is much faster than any
other Queensland horse in the business. In the
w.f.a. National Plate, 10 furlongs, the Maltster
chestnut cleared out from the field (it included
Mountain Song and Ardglen) in his brilliant way
and won. pulling up, by seven lengths, m 2mm. 6sec.
But the meeting was darkened by a tragedy, a wild
brute called Greek Historian bolting with Donaldson,
his amateur rider, after the Ladies’ Bracelet—
he had run last all the way—and bringing him into
violent contact with the branch ot a tree. Poor
Donaldson was picked up dead, his skull haying been
fractured. He had been substituted for another rider,
with whom the mad animal had galloped twice round
the course before the race.
“Samuel Suretliing”: Mention m The
Bulletin of Charlie Eady, representative cricketer
of the ’nineties, recalls an engaging incident on the
Elwiek (Tas.) course, where Eady was officiating as
judge some five years ago. There had been a close finish
in which the favorite was beaten, and the crowd
howled its disapproval at the decision. One massive
demonstrator became abusive. “C’m outa the box!”
he yelled. ‘’And c’m on! I’ll show yer.” Eady
came out. He crossed the paddock in a few strides,
but not before his prey had backed hurriedly into
the crowd, now strangely silent. A police-inspector
laid a friendly hand on the judge’s shoulder and
whispered something. Eady nodded, as if recognising
the soundness of the appeal. “But,” lie remarked
a trifle regretfully, as he turned back, “I could
eat him!” And he probably could have.
The inter-State tennis tournament, N. S.
Wales v. Victoria, was begun on grass and finished
on concrete. There was a day’s play on saturated
courts at the White City, and another day’s play on
covered courts in the Hordern pavilion at the Show-
ground ; in the result, N. S. Wales was four matches
to the good—l 2 to 8. Generally speaking, the home
team was stronger in the singles and the visiting
combination in the doubles. Jim Willard, dis-
tinguished himself greatly by defeating O Haia
Wood at'” Rushcutter’s Bay (4 —6, 7—5, 7-—5) and
Schlesinger, who played for Vic., at the Showground
/g—6 6—4). And Haege, the Vic, colt, strengthened
the impression that he will be figuring in Davis
Cup contests before he is many years older. Though
Kahns beat him the first day (6—2, B—6, 6—3) the
youngster routed L. E. Baker (6 —4, 6—2) in his
second match, and, with Dickinson as his partnei,
overcame Peach and Willard (6 —4, 10 8) in the
doubles.
Four or five N.S.W. long-distance runners
are very much better than the rest. In the five miles
cross-country championship over the Randwiek steeple-
chase course, C. B. Weeks (St. George) had a
comfortable win in 29min. 52 2-ssec. from H. Hayden
(Botany), M. J. Mackenzie (Lidcombe), A. Gainslord
(St. George) and B. Swinbourne (Botany). Hayden
strained a muscle during the race, and the injury kept
him out of the 10-mile track championship at
Kensington on Saturday, but the others mentioned
were among the first four. After T. Lea (East
Sydney) had led for nine miles, Gainsford beat
Weeks in a rattling finish by half a yard, with
HELP!
PLAYER: “What did you blow your whistle for?”
REFEREE: “The police!”
Swinbourne and Mackenzie next. Gainsford (who
won last year) did the trudge through the mud in
56min. 9sec.
The five miles cross-country championship of Vic-
toria, held at Ballarat on Saturday, resulted in a
meritorious win for George Hyde. The little runner
was soon in the lead, and, finishing better than
his club-mate, W. M. Whyte, he got home four
yards ahead in 26min. 36sec.—record time for the
race. F. Kohlman, of Hawthorn, was 200 yards
away, third. There were 167 starters.
“We’re not going to grab : we’re goingTo
help” was the unconscious epigram uttered by Bill
Szarka at a little swarry after the opening of his
Marrickville Olympia fN.S.W.) on Monday night.
It is the boxers Who are to be helped; and it was
time. In the main opening event, Stan Thurbon lost
his newly-acquired bantam championship to Jimmy
Kelly after one of the cleverest and most interesting
contests seen in Sydney for many a day. Veteran
Arthur Scott refereed, and there was no doubt about
the decision.

The outstanding feature of Saturday’s
boxing in the Commonwealth was the knocking out
by Jack Green of the new Queensland feather cham-
pion, Herb Acworth, at Brisbane Stadium. Both
were lib. over the regulation 9 stone. Ackworth
had stopped or outpointed every man previously sent
against him, and that Green should have succeeded
suggests either that the Queenslander was over-rated
or that poor little Jack has at last got over the
cruel gruelling he received as a mere boy, and
the effects of which were painfully evident for years.
He was bantam and feather champion before he
was 18.
South Sydney had a bitter struggle in the
mud against Eastern Suburbs in the last round ot
the N.S.W. Rugby League premiership. Ten minutes
before full-time East led by 5 to 3; but South,
playing a man short (Murphy had been sent off),
responded gamely, and O’Connor, the tall forward, got
over with two Easterners vainly trying to pull him
down. Wearing goaled, and the game was over
South, 8 to 5. In the 12 matches the premiers-
scored 190 points to 87, and in 18 years they have
been on top five times and runners-up on six occasions.
West, by defeating North, 18 to 13, gained second
place with 16 points, and St. George, Balmain and
North finished level with 15 points As regards
individual scorers, B. Wearing (South) led with
76 points (12 tries and 20 goals), G. Stettler (West),
coming next with 65 (5 tries and 25 goals).

The M.L. Ilugby Leaguers are having no
luck in Queensland. Ipswich defeated them bv
points to 21, and in their second match against
Queensland they were downed again. The Msitois
led by 15 to 13 at half-time, but faded towards the
end, and the Bananalanders ran out winners by
29 to 20. For Queensland, Aynsley, who wasn t
played in the first game, got four tries.

V crowd ot’ 33,500 nnd u ot £lllO
smiles on the faces of Melbourne and Collingwood
officials when the clubs collided at the big ground
on Saturday. And the game great—clever
systematic, strenuous and clean. Neither side could
get much of a lead, but the Magpies played harder,
if anvthing, in the last term, than in the hrs„
quarter, while the Red Legs perceptibly tired In
that last spell they added but seven points while the
’Woods put on 18, and the latter finished with 65
points to Melbourne’s 52. Essendon kept its place
in the final four by scoring 101 to Carlton s 62 ; and
Geelong stayed at the top by gathering in 86 points
to Richmond’s 32. South Melbourne and 1 ootscray
had a great go-in, South winning by 92 points to
’Scray’s 87 ; and Hawthorn finally smashep St.
Kilda’s hopes by raking in a few points when the
latter thought everything was all right: Hawthorn,
59; >St. Kilda, 56. Fitzroy, which has a poor chance
of reaching the finals unless Melbourne or ’Don gets
unaccountably beaten, piled up 120 points to North
Melbourne’s 74. During the week the League’s tri-
bunal considered the uproarious proceedings at the
Geelong-North game, and stressed its disapproval
thereof by disqualifying one Northerner for life, two
Geelong men for the rest of this season and the
whole of next, another Northerner for this season, and
yet another for three Saturdays. Then various persons
went home and thought hard.
The first Association semi-final drew 11,000
people to the Melbourne Motordrome, but interest faded
out of the game in the first quarter, in which Port
Melbourne, over-running the men of Northeote, estab-
lished a lead of 50 points, two behinds being North-
cote’s only contribution to the work of keeping the
scorers warm. Northeote made strenuous efforts to
turn the tide, but it was only a question of how
far it could reduce its opponent’s lead. Port eventu-
ally won by 96 (14 goals 12 behinds) to 66
(9 goals 12 behinds). It was a rough game, and
Port’s captain, Lewis, had to be carried off with
a broken leg at the end of the first quarter. Downs,
the Northeote rover, saw the game out, although
apparently badly mauled.

“Hamer” : The last quarter of the Mel-
bourne football match had only a few minutes to
go and one team was nearly 50 points ahead; but
the man with the shaggy hair looked round with
surprise as his mate started to move with the
crowd towards the gate, “Not going yet, are you?”
he exclaimed. “Aren’t you going to wait to see
the fight?”

The South Adelaide football club, which
Used to be a strong body in the days when men
chose their own clubs, has been holding a reunion
to talk over old times. It held the premiership
in Adelaide six times in the ’nineties; but the
electorate system hit it hard, and hits it worse as
population deserts the heart of the city to reside
in the suburbs. Some of the footballers were famous
cricketers, too. The late Jack Reedman was a member
in the palmy days; so were Clem Hill and Ernest
Jones, both present at the recent meeting. Olein
made his first inter-State trip with the football team,
at the age of 15. “I was a great big unsophisticated
country kid when I joined,” Jones told the meeting.
“They used to call me the Wild Man from Borneo.”
* * * *
“Wink”: There has never been a more
elegant left-hand batsman than Billy Bruce, who was
found drowned at Point Ormond (Vic.) one day
last week. When still at Scotch College, Bruce made
a reputation, and soon after joining Melbourne he
won a secure place in Victoria’s XI. In his first inter-
colonial he was selected for his bowling, but after
a game or two he was recognised as a master bats-
man. His off strokes, particularly the late cuts, were
perfection; but no matter how well set he often
killed an innings with an unsightly village-black-
smith pull. At cover-point we have had no
greater man. On one occasion he brilliantly caught
\V. G. Grace on the grass. The old fellow character-
istically declared that the ball had bounced, and
said something about an unfair appeal. Bruce, who
had a just pride in his sportsmanship, insisted on
and received an apology. Billy played in 46 inter-
colonial matches, making 2065 runs, average 24. He
visited England twice, in 1886 and 1893, and for his
14 Tests (9 in Australia) averaged 29.25, his highest
score being 80. His best knock was in the celebrated
game in which English and Australian smokers and
non-smokers met. Bruce and Shrewsbury went in first
and put up 194 for the first wicket, Billy's share
was 131, all made before lunch. In his middle-age
he became a leading golfer.

“Iford”: The tyranny of cricket records 1
The great heart of England, stirred by the thought
that Hobbs needs only two more centuries in first;
class cricket to take his tally ahead of “W.G.’s,’
is beating feverishly every time the Surrey batsman
takes block. The question of whether he will or
won’t pull of! the coveted distinction this month or
this year is probably creating keener interest than
the countv championship itself. Yet, after all, when
Hobbs does earn his crown of glory in the Wisdens
and similar records, as he is bound to do in the
near future, it won’t prove that he is a greater
batsman than Grace. The latter (1) stayed in the
very front rank from the mid-’sixties to the end
of last century, (2) made the bulk of his
centuries when such scores were very much
harder to get than nowadays, and (3)
played for a county that was generally very low
down in the list, whereas Hobbs has played for one
that is always near the top. For these and other
reasons the place that “W.G.” made for himself m
cricket is never likely to be challenged when com-
parisons are made between players of this generation
and past ones. Nevertheless, his paper records may
be, and doubtless will be, demolished one by one.
The hollowness of statistics!
“Hamer”: Cricketers who play for the
love of the game are to be provided with numerous
opportunities of refusing money next season by the
Board of Control. Take the case of a Victorian
who may be selected for the State team in all its
fixtures, and for both Australia v. The Rest matches.
He will play against the Westralians in Melbourne
on November 6, 7 and 9; go to Adelaide for the
Vic.-S.A. affair, Nov. 13, 14, 16 and 17 ; repair to
Sydney for Australia v. The Rest, December 4, a,
7 and 8 ; and rush back to Melbourne for the retuin
match, Dec. 11, 12, 14 and 15. On Dec. 18, 19 and
21 Vic. v. M.L. will occupy his attention m Mel-
bourne: and N.S.W. will invade his territory on
Dec. 26, 28, 29 and 30. Then the S.A. team will
keep him busy on January 1,2, 4 and 5, and. with
others, he will depart for Sydney again to play N.S.W.
on Jan. 23, 25, 26 and 27. Perhaps after that, it he
is selected for the English tour, he will decide
that it is useless to get back to toil again betoie
it starts; anyway, taking travelling and practice
into consideration, he will find it very hard to jamb
any ordinary work in between his cricket engage-
ments while they last.

“Gwy”: There was a mild boil-over at
N.S.W. Cricket Association’s annual meeting when
Tommy Howard was defeated in the choice o
delegates to the Australian Board of Control,
Smith, jun., and Allan Oxlade were re-elected:
the third man, who defeated Howard by two to oiic,
was Sydney solicitor W. C. Bull, who lias had
17 years’ service as secretary at Balmain. me
player-administrator question threatens to come up
again over the appointment of manager for nexi
year’s English tour. Candidates at present m the
field are Svd Smith, E. E. Bean, Clem Hill and 1.
11. Howard aforesaid. Possibly Warwick Armstrong
would have a cut also if he thought the Board would
not remember past years. Smith’s qualifications aie
indisputable, but on the principle of passing H
round he might do worse than support a man iuw
Ernie Bean. On his record in connection witn \ >c.
cricket, Bean is to be preferred to an ex-player who
has had several trips to England and whose quali-
fications for successful management of what is la
from being a picnic party are not apparent. Hayes
do well out of English tours ; administrators, on the
contrary, are poorer by the hours they give «P
the interest of the game, although they dou t gro\
about that. A position like this is one of tin-
few opportunities of rewarding excellent sen-ice ana
at the same time selecting a man wdio can be justine
by his record. t
“Ex-Dig” : The war may have been respon-
sible for the revival of ping-pong, which is again
sweeping like a fever through the Melbourne suburb .
Over 25 years ago it had a great vogue, until earetu
housewives, noticing the wearing of linoleums an
carpets and the breakages of domestic sundries,
decreed its banishment. When the war arrived, of

rooms and sent off as gifts to the soldiers recreatioi
huts, and a new generation learnt the pastime. Ip* a .

No, scroll of fame there was, no sporting panel
To hearten up the oldster or the kid,
No launch at elbow- touch with oil or flannel,
The filling chocolate and the timely tid.
Twas just its own reward to swim the Channel
Ere history’s dawn —if anybody did.
Now? Well, at five the written record sticks.
Who’s going into print as Number Six?

Death lias called for three of the old
coachdrivers who gathered together a couple
of months ago for a re-union at the big
Motor Show in Melbourne. Hector Mclntyre
died on the eve of his 84tli birthday. He
was the first man to settle at Port Campbell,
and his wife lived there with him for two
years before she saw the face of another
white woman. C. Hussey, of Healesville,
who was a comparatively young man of 67,
and Fred Simmons are the other two. The
latter was old enough to have driven a load
of Chinamen —40 to the load —to the Fid-
dlers’ Creek rush in 1861.
E. E. Cleland, the S. Aus. K.C., whose
opinions concerning the Thousand Homes
scheme and kindred matters have been freely
quoted in the Assembly by Attorney-General
Denny, is one of those men who have risen
high in the profession without any of the
limelight of politics. Twice he has been
to England to appear before the Privy Coun-
cil as counsel for the S. Aus. Government;
the cases that took him were the S. Aus.-
Vic. boundary dispute and the wheat-pool
mix-up. During Denny’s absence at the
war, Cleland voluntarily looked after the
court side of his practice.
A. V. Galbraith, one of the Vie. Forestry
Commissioners, who was appointed on pro-
bation for a year, has been given a five
years’ extension of his term. W. J. Code,
the eldest of the three Commissioners, is to
stay for another twelve months.
The annual dinner of St. Peter’s College
old boys, in Adelaide, took a modest pride
in having Stirling, President of the Leg.
Council, in the chair. Below the veteran
sat ex-Premier Harwell and Judge P’oole, the
present S.A. Administrator. The oldest in-
habitant was Hilary Boucaut (brother of the
Judge of last generation), who claims to
have been an original scholar when St.
Peter’s was founded, 78 years ago.
“ILK.”: August 3 last, marked the 73rd
anniversary of the arrival in Sydney of the
first mail steamer, the P. and O. screw
steamer, Chusan, of 700 tons. The trip be-
tween Southampton and Sydney took 67
days. To celebrate the event a ball was
given on August 26, 1852, in the great room
at the Sydney Museum, the band of the lltli
Regiment performing. The Chusan’s out-
ward mail matter for London comprised
1559 letters and 713 papers. At this period
Major Christie was Postmaster-General at
Sydney on a salary of £BOO per annum.
“X2X” : A notable invention, and one that
should be invaluable in medical schools
is the episcope, a sort of combination
camera obscura and moving-picture pro-
jector. By means of this it is possible for
any number of students to watch the carry-
ing out of a surgical operation while it is
in actual progress. At present it is not
practicable to admit more than a few stu-
dents at a time to an operating-theatre,
hence many are unable to see and follow the
methods of leading surgeons and operators.
But with the episcope every detail can be
presented in another room. In medical
schools like those of Melbourne and Sydney
the episcope will fill a long-felt want.
“The Traveller”: The other day, at a Wes-
tern Vic. railway station, I saw a large box
divided into about 12 foot-square compart-
ments, each containing a full-grown hare.
The box was consigned to the sec. of a cours-
ing club at Adelaide, and a day or two later
I read in a daily paper that the hares had
duly arrived at their destination, and were
expected to provide good sport. Sport! I
am not squeamish, but I confess that I felt
as if I wouid like to see some of the humans
responsible boxed up in a similar manner,
sent on a 24-hour journey by train, and then,
after a day or two to freshen them up, turned
loose to be pursued by hungry carnivora.
What does the S.P.O.A. think about it?
“Nikko” : Too many M.L. industries are
falling into the hands of foreigners. The
kauri-gum trade is almostly completely in the
grip of Austrians and Slavs, the Chinese
have captured the retail fruit and vegetable
business, and the Greeks and Italians are in-
creasing their hold on the fisheries. It is
suggested that instead of allowing the bene-
fits of our rich fishing grounds to go to
foreigners, Scottish and English fisherfolk
should be given inducements to come this
way. Unfortunately the fishing population
of Britain is apt to be conservative and
stay-at-home, but the chances are they would
make better colonists and find their new sur-
roundings more congenial than many who
are being unloaded on the country.
“Topee” : In the early days of the military
occupation of German New Guinea, justice
was administered on free and easy lines.
One day a district-officer, returning from
patrol duty, learned that the Chinese in-
habitants had been playing up during his
absence, and promptly ordered all parties
to “make court” on the morrow. When they
appeared Ivwong Lee, the storekeeper,
charged Ah Loy, a trader with attempting to
break into his store. Witnesses were fairly
divided, and as some, couldn’t or wouldn’t
speak “pidgin” an interpreter was employed.
I dropped in just in time to hear the magis-
trate give his decision. After admonishing
all hands for their quarrelsomeness, he fined
Kwong Lee £5 for keeping a disorderly house ;
Ah Loy £2 for using threatening language;
and all witnesses £1 each for having been
found on licensed trading premises after 10
p.m. Finally the interpreter received three
months without the option. Feeling curious
about the workings of the judicial mind. I
asked the d.-o. later how he arrived at the
various penalties. “Kwong.” he said,
“is suspected of passing opium to some
pals along the coast, and he’ll attri-
bute his fine to that. There may be
something in the charge, so Ah Loy is well
out of it for two quid. As for the others I d
have fined them next week anyhow for keep-
ing dirty premises, so they’ll go home and
clean up, thinking they’ve only paid in
advance.” “But why three moons for the
interpreter?” “Because lie’s the best car-
penter in the place, and I want another table
and some lounge chairs made. He'll finish
them in a fortnight. Then I'll review his
sentence, and he’ll get the interpreter’s fees:
in any case, he proliably deserves a sixer for
something I haven’t found out. And, what
between fines and court costs, there 11 be
about £5O to remit next boat to headquar-
ters, so you see everybody ought to be satis-
fied.” And he took a drink with the air or
a man who is oonscir-w of having done his
duty without fear or favor.

Sylk-Arto repealed
by the SKort Skirt
THE turn of Fashion’s Wheel,
bringing the short skirt into
vogue, has brought Bond’s Sylk-
Avto” Hosiery into greater prom-
inence than ever.
None but Hosiery of the most beautifully lustrous
texture, none but Hosiery that presents com
tinuously a flawless Silken surface, unmarred by
ladders, can be worn with the present day frock-
ino. Discerning women, having discovered that
“Sijlk~Ario” offers all that is required of Hosiery
by the modes of to-day, are employing it foi
street wear exclusively, satisfied that no other
hose combines so effectively Silken qualities with
a perfect lustre and a resistance to hard wear
that is out of all proportion to its really
moderate price.
When next you admire some other womans
hose, remember that it is probably “Sijlh~Arto
and that you, too, could be wearing hose of like
attractiveness.

Dorothea Spinney is back interpreting her
old friend Euripides at the Sydney Conser-
vatorium. On Saturday night Dorothea
suggested some immortal vestal flame lit to
the glory of the classic Muse. Opening
her season with the “Alcestis,” she was
alternately (and completely) Apollo, Death,
Alcestis, Admetus, King Pheres, Heracles
and - the all-pervasive Chorus. Her voice
holds as many notes as a mountain stream,
and her every movement is poetry.

A Royal progress :
After plodding through Venice with V. Rutherford.
Java with Alfred Coffey, England with Roland
Wakelin and various parts of this continent with
numerous other artists, the conscientious critic at
the Royal Society of Artists’ show at the Education
Galleries, Sydney, by the time he reaches W. Lister
Lister’s vast pastoral lease entitled “Evenfall, Berke-
ley Hills, Onanderra” (No. 100), is short of breath.
A doubt arises whether the scaling of the monotonous
expanse of hillside with which the president of the
society has filled seven-eighths of his large can-
vas is worth the trouble, especially as at least
three tolerable pictures could be cut out of the
foreground and leave enough over to paper a fair-
sized room. A nice study by the same artist, No.
99, “A Bush Track,” inspires wonder that he should
imagine a mastodon to be necessarily more impressive
than a mouse-deer. On the portions of the wall
unoccupied by Lister are to be found some naive
“FAIR AND WARMER,” AT SYDNEY
BALACE.
Nellie Bramley and Arthur Cornell, amateur
bacchanalians, sample a cocktail of their
own making.
efforts by J. S. Watkins, who takes an almost in-
fantile joy in the extensive range of his paint-box;
some luminous effects by Lloyd Rees, who finds beauty
as well as ethics in the dust (No. 13) ; several Syd
Long’s, including- a poetically manipulated Hawkes-
bury landscape which has charmed open the pockets
of the National Gallery, and No. 31, “Landscape,
Wyndham, Northern Territory,” which has nothing-
wrong with it except that Wyndham isn’t in the
Northern Territory; some honest gums by J. Salvana,
who sometimes paints like himself and sometimes
like Syd Long-; and a good deal by Eric Langker, who
looks promising and in No. 119, “The Mountain
Pool,” has painted a gentle picture, in which a soft
Australian countryside is mellowly smoking its
evening pipe as if it had done it for a thousand
years. Tom Roberts, in No. 35, £alls attention to
the beauty of the clouds ; but Alfred Coffey, in his
Last Indian studies, hasn’t observed the interesting
fact that there is less color in the tropics under
the naked sun than there is in Cornwall, Eng., or
Woy Woy, N.S.W., under the dullest sky, for the
reason that sunshine is a great sucker-out of color.
Amongst the portraits, Mary M. Edwards’s maiden
(No. 65) has a curious sketchy charm, and Henry
Crisp’s debutante (No. 169) is a well-painted study
of a compact and very self-contained young person.
VV. A. Bowring, R. 0.1., a recent arrival from M.L.,
has a highly polished portrait of that picturesque
identity of Wellington (M.L.), Rabbi Van Staveren,
in all his priestly pomp. There is some subtlety in
the way G. Lyall Trindall has made his figure of a
lady (No. 103) rise out of rumor about the feet
into reality about the sincerely painted face. Datillo
Rubbo has the only problem picture in the show, and
the only problem in the picture is how the lady with
the crooked mouth is balancing on her head the roll of
old kapok that is doing duty for her hair. J. S. Wat-
kin’s “Kathleen” (No. 94) was painted in a vacuum
or the moon, while VV. H. Bushby has painted himself
under a theatrical spotlight, not without effect. Roland
Wakelin and G. Cossington Smith are the only two
anarchists to throw mild bombs into the Royal pro-
cession. Smith’s weapon of offence, No, 161, “Centre
of a City,” is a groggy study of Martin-place, Sydney,
and as an infernal machine is rather in the nature
of a squib.

“Little Jessie James” is still staving off
the sadness of departure for Dorothy Brim-
ton at Sydney Opera House.
* * *
Fred Bluett is back at Sydney Tivoli, dis-
sipating the heartache caused among flappers
by the departure of the U.S. Fleet with his
spirited picture of the elderly person who
becomes the guardian of a jar of goldfish.
Zaronda La Bella, the Mexican charmer who
changes her frock after every song, has not
yet begun to pall, and judging from the re-
ception that still attends the “Meanderings
of Monty” and Milton I-layes, the jester from
the Old Country appears booked for a Mara-
thon run. A troupe of apes—Bradley’s Mon-
key Orchestra —almost reaches the standard
of the average jazz band in its exhibition
of trombone trumpeting and saxophone
puffing, even with the handicap imposed by
an occasional scratch for fleas.
Norwegian tenor Oscar Beck is fring-
ing an atmosphere of fjords and sardine
canneries to Sydney Fullers’. There are no
officious traffic cops to take the numbers of
the daring motor-cyclists who do some sensa-
tional speeding on a soup-plate track; the
turn is risky enough to delight the gods.
Videau and Kirby extract some pints of
fun from their amusing burlesaue of the old-
time crook of Bland Holt melodrama, while
the clever aerial antics of the Aeda gymnastic
troupe suggest that they should be retained
by the Aviation Department -to test the
effectiveness of parachutes. The remaining
contributors to the programme are mostly
content to beef out with gusto the latest in
syncopated melodies.
At Sydney Hoyt’s “The Goose Hangs
High” (understood to be the American way
of saying that the pearls of life take some
deep diving to secure) is gratifying the simple
tastes of the film-fancier. Tom Mix has
pawned his cowboy rigout and donned the
picturesque costume of highwayman Dick
Turpin at the Lyric. As usual, Mix is in-
vested with so much glory, courage and
chivalry that there is none left for the other
characters. In “The Parasite,” at the
Lyceum, everybody is engaged in slan-
dering everybody else; on the acting side
the film is an instance of screencraft at its
worst. “The Enemies of Women,” at the
Piccadilly, adapted from the book of that
name by Blasco Ibanez, is an improvement
on the work of ordinary scenario scribes.
It is also unusual, in that the good-looking
young hero hasn’t a female to embrace. At
the Empress “The Air Mail” is carrying
bills and billets-doux from New York to the
Pacific Coast in the teeth of gales and de-
spite crooks. “Quo Vadis” is the Crystal
Palace’s lodestone, and Rudolph Valentino
struts as “Monsieur Beaucaire” at the
Prince Edward.
With loud sobs in her voice Muriel Starr
goes back to matrimony with her former
husband for the sake of their son, at Mel-
bourne King’s. The Jewish-French financier
of C. M. Hallard is the best characterisation
yet presented by that actor; but the part
itself contains one of those curious mistakes
which are liable to trip the most careful
dramatists. Before the Heriot characteris-
tics in her son are forced upon her notice,
Wanda expresses the opinion that, after all,
who is the father of a child does not really
matter so very much. Lazaun starts his con-
tradiction with “I am a Jew,” as if that
explains his opinion. Actually, the son of a
Jewish mother and a non-Jewish father can
obtain a much readier admission in a syna-
gogue than one of vice-versa parentage—the
Hebrew race goes far beyond all others in
recognition of the predominant influences of
the mother. “Within the Law” looms some-
where in the distance with the Muriel Starr
co., but “The Pelican” evidently has some
time to run yet.
“ WTLDFLOWER," AT MELBOURNE
ROYAL.
Marie Burke as Nino Benedetto, and Gus
Bluett as Gabrielle.
Violinist Chuhaldin had his first introduc-
tion to Melbourne audiences on Wednesday
of last week when he participated in the Uni-
versity Symphony Orchestra’s outbreak at
the Auditorium. His rendering of the Max
Ilrucli Concerto in 0 Minor was not faultless,
but there was real feeling in it; Schubert’s
“Ave Maria” was the encore. Four Wagner
excerpts provided the main orchestral pro-
gramme ; but although Miss Constance Ziebell
led the orchestra efficiently, there was a ten-
dency amongst some of the individual per-
formers to slip. There might have been a
greater verve in the “Entry of the Gods into
Valhalla”; some of the players seemed to
feature the gods as a bunch of highly re-
spectable tradespeople going to a theatre
party. “Wotan’s Farewell” was better. Dr.
Rudall, whose work on the horn is always
finished, scored a triumph in "The Intro-
duction to Act III” (Tristan). Edward
Goll’s playing of a Mozart concerto was
rather subdued and patchy.
Altliouse and Middleton passed on last week;
but Melbourne has still the opportunity to
saturate itself in music. Besides several local
shows William Heughan was due to open
a series of concerts last night (Wednesday),
and Chuhaldin starts his run on Saturday.
“Wildflower” is blooming bravely at Mel-
bourne Theatre Royal. Herbert Browne has
lost a good deal of the stiffness shown on
the first night, and the good impression
created by Marie Burke is repeated at every
view. The same remark is applicable to
Gus Bluett.
“No, No, Nanette” is making the New
Princess the most popular centre of night-
time activity in Melbourne. Apparently the
six weeks it has run are only the first lap
of a Marathon.
All last week the Fleet gala decorations
were an additional attraction at His Majesty’s,
Melbourne, and the extras included some very
excellently-arranged tableaux. These finished
on Saturday night, but “Kid Boots” con-
tinues to dance through its usual course of
gaiety.
With the passing of “Snap” last Saturday
darkness has fallen on the New Palace again.
Brightness prevails at the Athenaeum,
where “Back Again” skips its way through
a spriglitlier chain of levity than “Let’s Go”
—which is saying a good deal. Lee White’s
singing and dancing are nothing special; but
she has personality in tons and a fine sense
of humor. Ernest Sefton deserves most
thanks amongst the comedians. His Chris-
tian name should be Tom —or Jack.

Last night (Wednesday, 12th) the Mel-
bourne Repertory Theatre staged “Captain
Brassbonnd’s Conversion,” at the Playhouse.
The show will continue until Saturday night.
At Melbourne Tivoli Will Fyffe’s make-up
is a triumph in his “I'm Ninety-four To-day,”
and there is real art in his senile chuckles
and choked-back coughs. Reg Wykeham, with
two assistants, puts over an excellent sketch
of the curtain-raiser order, “The Bachelor”
—Wykeham himself being a gay old bird
who, having restored harmony on the hearth
where he has philandered, picks up the the-
atre tickets the husband has brought in vain
to take the other woman to a show, and
casually asks the lady’s address. Madeline
Rossiter, still remarkably thin and energetic,
is back on the programme.
Paul Warton and his company of acro-
bats and equilibrists have introduced liveliness
to the Melb. Bijou programme; their turn
runs in a crescendo of thrills. Amy Rochelle,
with a stoutness acquired in the last few
years which has in no way affected her
capacity for those shrill high notes which the
gods love, is as popular as ever, her child
impersonations being specially commendable.
George Wallace wanders into territory in
which firemen do everything but pul
out fires; and on the first showing a couple
of young ladies of the co. showed a thoroughly
realistic reluctance to jump from the window
of a blazing building into the fall-breaking
blanket below.
At the Melbourne Majestic, Princess Ran-
giriri and her Nine Maori Maids create a
turmoil amongst the pictures. The Maori
dances are well staged and make a show in
themselves. On the screen side “The Mail-
man" shows that there is romance even in
the department which (next to the Income-
tax office) is most cursed amongst mortals:
and “Cornin’ Thru’ the Rye” is a likeable
picture. “Painted Daughters,” an Australian
production, takes the screen on Saturday.
Hoyt’s De Luxe see Virginia Valli in “Up
the Ladder,” showing how a lady with money
can ruin her husband to save him from the
other woman. The supporting film is “The
Beloved Cheater.”

Thurston Hall is highly popular at Adel-
aide Royal with his attempt to bring Britain
and the U.S.A. together by scoring off both.
Australia can hold the scales and enjoy the
joke both ways. The play, however, was
obviously written by an American; and un-
fortunately Latimer, who now plays the Eng-
lish aristocrat, does not trouble to make him
sufficiently unlike the. caricature. Althouse
and Middleton are singing at the Town Hall,
and Arthur Aldridge at the Majestic; and

Katie Towers, Bert Escott and a clock.
•the old “Human Nature” from Drury-lane
is being revived at the Prince of Wales,
with George Cross and Leslie Adrienne in
the. lead, and Darcy Kelway funnier than
ever.
“Hamfat”: The Frenchiness of “Th“
Lady” recalls the fact that Australia has had
visitors who put on plays in the tongue of
Gaul. In the little Novelty Theatre, Mel
bourne —the site is now owned by the Salva-
tion Army—Madame Andree, with two
actors named Mumie and Aubert, produced
in 1880 “Jean Marie” and “La Pluie et le
Beau Temps”—good mummers and line plays
if the audience had been able to understand
them. The show went away frostbitten.
Eight years later “L’Etincelle,” “Les
Ressources de Jonathan” and another one-
acter were staged brightly in one evening at
the Freemasons’ Hall by a co. brought to
Australia by Tessero. Signora Majeroni’s
brother; but, though Mile. Dermancourt was
a particularly lively belle, and she had with
her in Blanchet a comedian who in his time
alternated parts with Ooquelin, the season
was a financial failure. Nor did the divine
Sarah make any fortune for her management.

“Satis”: As no one expects to find any
logic or consistency in the utterances of union
secretaries, it was not surprising to read
that the same Huckerby who recently avowed
that, although an Australian, he was opposed
to any restriction on imported films was
complaining a few days later that “the prac-
tice of overseas artists employing their
mothers, sisters and other relatives as dress-
ers,” denies employment to native-born union-
ists. Huckerby is too thick-headed to see
that if the film-making industry were estab-
lished here it would provide work for thou-
sands of his fellow-countrymen, and that if
all overseas stage artists were compelled to
employ union dressers the rule would only
benefit a dozen people at the most. What
has the Australian worker done that he
should have such fussy, small-visioned
leaders ?
“Caesar’s Ghost” : The stage-manager, new
to his job in a Victorian theatre, made a
complaint to his manager about the language
one of the actor-rs had used to him. “Wliat’s
the trouble?” asked the manager, breezily;
and the complainant explained that he had
been called a "blankard.” “Gosh!” said the
manager. “How long have you been on the
stage? Don’t you know that’s what every
stage-manager is?”
“Lud”: Jose Collins (B. 30/7/’25),
though many rumors of her appearance in
Australia have been circulated, is hardly
likely to make the trip; that is, unless she
changes her mind, which, after all, is an
actress’s privilege. Jose recently returned
to the “ ’alls” (she started there as the child
introduced in Lauder’s song “I Love a
Lassie”), and in a first-night speech de-
clared that she would “never go back to
musical comedy.” As she can command more
money in vaudeville Jose probably means
what she says, in which case Australian
audiences will miss seeing one of the best
comic-opera stars of recent years.
“Ilamfat” : Edgar Warwick, Maud F'ane’s
first husband, is managing the Australian
tour of the Russian violinist, Chuhal-
din. For 18 years, except for an occasional
visit to Australia, Warwick has been work-
ing an Afro-Asiatic circuit, chiefly with cos-
tume comedy show's. The circuit extends
from Cairo to Pekin, and takes some navi-
gating for more reasons than one. The audi-
ences are almost entirely “front-seaters” —-
except, possibly, for a musical comedy, the
cheaper parts of the theatre are unprofitable.
Once Warwick, having been seen talking to
an Eurasian who had been a regular patron,
was reproached by an English friend who
had white prejudices in an accentuated form.
“You can’t blame me for being polite to
the beggar,” retorted Warwick. “He’s my
entire gods.”
“X.N.0.”: No, “Fore” (B. 30/7/’25), I
w r as not referring to ships’ concert parties
when I put in my claim as the furthest-
north amateur actor. The melancholy engine-
room artificer, with his eternally mournful
rendering of “The Deathless Army,” fol-
lowed by an equally doleful version of a
child’s request that its old pot shall not em-
bark on a mining enterprise, had no place
in “Squeeze that Lemon,” which title, by the
way, was given to the piece by an Australian
army officer, then our guest in the Colling-
wood. I have the programme, perhaps the
only one left, in front of me now. We did
not depend for our humor on the “Elinor
Glyn-Ellova Grin” type of humor, nor did
.Miss Faith Ittscold find a place in onr cast.
After reading the “book” a London manager
offered me a theatre if I could get the origi-
nal cast together, but that was impossible.
“Hamfat”: Circus training saved Daisy
Alton, one of the wire-walking sisters, from,
injury when Hoyt’s verandah crashed in
Melbourne recently. Daisy w T as standing on
the edge of the falling awning, and only the
habit of balancing prevented her from going
with it. The Alton girls were born in the
business, so to speak; their mother was a
circus wire-walker, and daughter of a circus
performer, and dad, who is also an acrobat,
now runs a gymnasium in Maoriland.
“Hamfat” : “Camille” is now almost as essen-
tial a part of a touring company’s repertory
as “East Lynne”; and at least one manager
has introduced a curious addition to it. He
was partly financed in the venture by a
wealthy chemist, some conditions being at-
tached to the advance. Now the coughing
Camille is advised, by a character supposed
to be unaware that she is dying of consump-
tion, to “take Slops’s Soothing Syrup; I
have found that it cures even the worst
cold.” “East Lynne” is mutilated likewise.
In the Little Willie death-scene, the table
by the kid’s bed is decorated with medicine-
bottles having the names of Slops’s various
decoctions on them, and Madame Vine opens
the scene by saying: “Come, Willie, take
your Slops’s Soothing Syrup; you know you
like it so much!” The line which follows:
“How long will it be before I die, Madame
Vine?” impairs the effect of the advertise-
ment, but Slops doesn’t seem to mind.
“Mid-Channel” : Together, Gilbert and Sul-
livan (B. G/8/’25) did great things; sepa-
rated, they failed. Gilbert collaborated with
Alfred Cellier, composer of “Dorothy,” in
“The Mountebanks.” The book Is up to
Gilbert’s usual standard, but outside a few
melodies, such as “Put a Penny in the Slot,”
the music is poor. Sullivan turned to Sidney
Grundy, and together they produced “Haddon
Hall.” This time it was the music that
ran first. Sullivan also became associated
with Pinero in “The Beauty Stone” (1898),
Comyns Carr supplying the lyrics. There is
nothing wrong with the music, but Pinero
was far better by himself. Sullivan, how-
ever, composed a delightful little melody for
Pinero which was sung in the third act of
“The Profligate,” afterwards produced in
Sydney by Charles Cartwright and Olga
Nethersole at the Garrick, now the Tivoli.
When Gilbert and Sullivan became recon-
ciled after the carpet dispute, they were re-
sponsible for “The Grand Duke” and “Uto-
pia Limited.” Neither of these was up to
their mark. Then there was another break.
Sullivan was in the middle of “The Emerald
Isle” when the final call came.
“R.K.D.N.”: Looking in at “Spring Clean-
ing” the other evening, the thought struck
me that the comedy would be benefited by
being played by an all-British cast. The
piece is so essentially English that it loses
a lot of its effect when interpreted, in several
of its principal roles, by Americans —good
artists though they be. For example, I can-

not believe that the good hearted street-
walker, as played, is a typical Londoner, as
she obviously is intended to be. And if a
person sitting at a play cannot bring him-
self to believe in it, it’s all TJ.P. with the
play.
“Nikko”: A noticeable thing about act-
resses who have had much experience in the
movies is the way in which they continue to
register facially after the necessity for deli-
berate facial expression has passed. \\ ith
meticulous care they linger at hate, sur-
prise, annoyance or delight until the imagi-
nary camera has caught them satisfactorily.
The actress unaccustomed to the screen gets
on with her part unaffected by any such con-
sideration, with much more satisfactory re-
sults. Watching a screen star making faces
at the invisible lens on the legitimate stage,
one is driven to the conclusion that a long
course of Hollywood unfits an actress foi
the more hurried expression of emotions re-
quired in the spoken drama.
A SHORT-TERM CONTRACT.
RUPERT: “You turn me down to marry that
Yankee! Don’t you know lie’s married?”
CLARIBEL : “Why worry? He comes from
Hollywood.”
“The Deacon”: “Roka” (B. 6/8/’25) asks
why “East Lynne” is never off the boards.
Simply because of the eternal feminine crav-
ing for a good cry. Billy good
actor though he was, used invariably to wind
up a season in the bush with “East Lynne” at
a shilling admission for ladies, “so that,” he
explained, “they may have a cheap cry.
And cry they did !
“Cliarlick”: During the absence, on holi-
days, of Nellie Payne, her part in “The
Street Singer” is being taken by John Ral-
ston’s 18-year-old daughter, Mascot. Mascot s
performance is uncommonly good in every
department, and if her sweet voice fulfils its
promise a bright future is assured for the
pretty youngster. John Ralston was the solo-
ist in “The Star-Spangled Banner,” the prin-
cipal item in the tableaux at the gala per
formance on Tuesday night.
“C. Ockney” : The most sought-after play-
wright in England to-day is the 25-year-old
Noel Coward. At the moment he has four
productions on the London boards: “Fallen
Angels” at the Globe, “The A r ortex” at the
Little, “Hay Fever” (with Marie Tempest)
at the Ambassadors’, and the Charles B.
Cochran revue, “On with the Dance,” at the
Pavilion. Of this latter concoction, Coward
is also responsible for the majority of the
musical numbers. A fifth piece entitled
“Easy Virtue” was on the point of being
presented when the last mail left. By now
every London manager may be putting on
Coward plays. “Nothing succeeds like ex-
cess.” to quote Oscar Wilde.
“Sierra”: If “Fore” (B. 30/7/’25) wishes
to see a picture free from the nautical
absurdities of most Yankee sea-stories, let
him spring a bob for an eyeful of “Down to
the Sea in Ships,” with its representation ot
old whaling days in New Bedford. The ves-
sels employed are real ships properly sailed,
and the capture and cutting-up of whales
are'realistically presented. The film should
be an object-lesson to Australian producers,
who have, in the crayfishing industry of Bass
Strait, material enough for dozens of spec-
tacular, educative and exciting pictures.
Superb coastal scenery, picturesque rock.v
and wooded islets, beautiful fast-sailing
schooners, the catching of sharks for bait,
tussles with octopuses and immense conger-
eels —all are there for the taking. And with-
out stretching recent history in the slightest,
there could be staged enough authentic law-
lessness to satisfy the most exacting movie
patron.
“C.K.” announces a revival: —
There is to be a Gilbert and Sullivan revival in
Australia in March, 1926. Two performers who were
in the last company have already been engaged—
James Hay, tenor, and Charles Walenn, comedian.
The acting of a G. and S. opera is to a certain
extent stereotyped. Gilbert knew what he wanted,
and every movement is marked in the “prompt” book.
Some doubtful “improvements” have crept in from
time to time. Gilbert once said to an over-zealous
comedian: “Please don’t try to be funny—if there
is a laugh, the line will get it!” Cne thing is
essential to an adequate performance of these operas.
Every person in the cast must be a competent
vocalist. Sullivan never wrote a bar which was
not worth singing. Several of the sopranos at the
Savoy had grand-opera experience, and of the men,
Durward Lely, the original Nanki Poo, was the
excellent Don Jose of Emily Soldcne’s “Carmen”
co. when that vivacious woman played the name part.
He appeared as Signor Leli. Brown low, poor Dick
Green and Scott Fishe all had successful grand-opera
experience; and if it had not been for the disastrous
management by D’Oyly Carte of the Royal English
Opera House (now the Palace Theatre), it is doubt-
ful whether the present writer would ever have
gravitated into light opera. Anyway, competent,
vocalists are essential, and it is to be hoped that the
management will select them from those who are
already in Australia and not seek them overseas.
“C. Ockney”: Since, she left. Australia
Dorothy Seaeombe, who grew up on our
stages, has had nothing but good fortune.
She was recently selected by Godfrey Tcarle,
probably the finest leading-man in London,
for the name-part in his newest production,
“Salomy Jane,” put on at the Queen’s last
month. The bright little comedienne’s per-
formance in “Just Married” during that
piece’s six-months’ run was responsible for
her latest engagement. Talent will out in
England.
“Satis”: Wonderful how our stage favor-
ites develop after they leave Australia. Sara
Allgood, whose “Peg o’ My Heart” delighted
us a few years ago, is now playing a singing
part in London, and proving a quite capable
vocalist at that. She is the Mrs. Peachum
of “The Beggar’s Opera,” revived once more
at the Lyric, Hammersmith, where the old
piece scored such an extraordinary success
a few years back. Sara is said, by a com-
petent London critic, to have “rendered with
taste her solos and her share of the ducts
with Polly.”
“Loud.” : Australia’s old friend Mrs. Brown
Potter turns up in the reminiscences which
Chance Newton (“Carados”) is writing of
Beerbohm Tree. Tree “got bitten with a
yearning to play D’Artagnan, a part right
out of his line”; his performance was “un-
worthy of him, and the extremely ‘Amurri-
can’ accent of the haughty Miladi —the
beautiful Mrs. Brown Potter—Tree found
even less controllable than his white horse.”
But, then, “Carados” is always a bit rough
on Tree. He "even rakes up, as a piece of
surpassing conceit, the remark, assuredly
meant to be humorous if ever made, that the
searchlights thrown on the night sky during
the air raids on London were “A waste; that
light ought to be thrown on me!”
“Cliarlik”: Mention of Barry Sullivan (B.
7/5/’25) recalls another of the old Shak-
spearean brigade, Charles Dillon. A fine,
robustious actor, with a great voice and a
splendid appearance, he did not restrict him-
self to _ Shakspeare. Such plays as “Bel-
phegor” and “The Hunchback” were included
in his repertory, but it was as “Richard III.”
and “Macbeth” that I remember him best.
The late Henry Irving was at one time a
member of his company. Shortly after
Irving’s epoch-making performance of “Ham-
let” at the Lyceum, he met his one-time
manager in the Strand. “Good morning, Mr.
Dillon,” he said. “Good morning,” replied
Dillon ; “you have the advantage” “My
name is Irving, Henry Irving; I was a mem-
ber of your company—left you at Glasgow.”
“What’name did you say?” “Irving—Henry
Irving!” “Ah, yes!” said Dillon, imper-
turbably. “Are you doing anything now?”
Hector’s hectic night:—
A painful experience befell the Mephisto-
pheles in a Maoriland production of “Faust.” Hector,
a great lover, but no great hero, w,as philandering
with the barmaid in the pub adjoining the theatre,
and during an interval showed himself to her in his
full warpaint. But a brutal person who claimed a
lien upon the lady disturbed the meeting and, having
missed the mummer after chasing him through the
hotel, established himself menacingly at the stage-
door. Desperate to get back to the stage, Mephisto
emerged from his retreat, but a fierce shout warned
him that the enemy had seen him and was in pur-
suit. Happening on a bicycle, Hector mounted it
and pedalled desperately into the darkness, with
the avenger following on another bike. By the time
Hector had shaken off his pursuer, which he only
managed to do by forsaking the bicycle, he was well in
the country; and, a devil being an unexpected and
terrifying apparition so far from the theatre, all sorts
of things happened to him. He tried to get a lift
from a man who was driving to the township, but
the scared horse bolted. He knocked up the people
in a near-by house; the women fainted and their men-
folk barricaded the doors and said they would shoot
if he did not clear away. He was attacked by dogs
and threatened by market-gardeners, a primitive race;
and in the end he was rounded up by police, who
had received word about the lunatic who was roaming
the district. And then the management, declaring
that he had spoilt the performance, rubbed salt into
his wounds by declining to pay him. The distressing
night cured Hector’s amativeness for quite a long
time.

War Conversion Loan
The interest rate —5| per cent. —is undeniably
a good one. The interest is exempt from State
Income Tax, and is, therefore, really equivalent
to more than 5| per cent, as compared with an
ordinary investment.
The Investor has the Option
of investing for 6 years, or 11 years, or 16 years;
of paying at once the full amount of thb‘subscrip-
tion, or 10 per cent., or a greater percentage, as
a deposit. Interest on the amount paid will begin
to accumulate immediately at the rate of 5 J per
cent, per annum.
Advantages of Conversion
are obvious. Every holder of War Loan 4| per
cent. Bonds maturing in December next who
agrees to convert into the new Loan will begin
to receive interest at the rate of 5| per cent, as
from the date on which he lodges his application.

Why Few Escape
Tooth trouble caused by film
Why so many teeth are cloudy
You know how teeth discolour and
decay, despite the daily brushing.
Dingy teeth and injured teeth became
almost universal.
Now millions of people use a new
method of teeth cleaning. They com-
bat the film —the great enemy of teeth.
How film clouds and
ruins teeth
Film is the great tooth enemy—
that viscous film you feel. No or-
dinary tooth paste effectively combats
it, so much of it clings and stays. It
makes the teeth unclean and unsightly.
Film also holds food substance which
ferments and forms acid. It holds
the acid in contact with the teeth to
cause decay. Germs breed by millions
in it. They, with tartar, are the chief
cause of pyorrhea.
That is how teeth are ruined.
Modern science has discovered two
effective film combatants. One dis-
integrates the film at all stages of for-
mation. One removes it without harm-
ful scouring.
Dental authorities, after careful tests,
have given these methods their en-
dorsement. A new-type tooth paste
has been created to apply them daily.
The name is Pepsodent. Leading den-
tists everywhere began to advise it.
Unique results, and
delightful
Pepsodent brings unique results,
amazing and delightful.

that you and yours should always use
this method. Cut out form now.

O. : Not very interesting.. . .Stellsby :
But we pay for everything printed... .Occultist:
Yon have left it too late....El. V.: The space
isn’t available....R.O.A.: Too much like too many
other ratings T.R.P.H.: Not a very striking
nosegay... .G.J.H.: Sorry, can’t give it more atten-
tion at present.... i'oolosopher: Light weight....
Wellington U.: That crop has been well harvested.
John H.: “Actors and Life’’ holds no new
thought, and the language is often tangled ancl
sometimes comes to blows with grammar.... 1 .A.L.:
Moves very heavily... .T.T.R.: The verses are weak
and say little.... F.W.N.: As a parody it is poor
and it" doesn’t get to anything worth while
K.B.G.: There is no “poetry” worth speaking of
there E.l). (Perth): “Hating” misses. Try some
other form. It is altogether too easy to write
weak sonnets F.M. (Canterbury) : Very small inter-
est T.M.R.: You have little hope of being able
to “make a living” by verses of that sort—or any
sort.... J.M.S.D.: Horrible yarn based on too many
improbabilities... .E.M.B.; The “Plough” must go
back... .Olive P.: No use to us. .. .A.E.Y.: The
Verses are not much improved... .J.P.M.: Doesn’t
move us. Rouseabout: Not enough in it to matter.
G.M.W.: Flops about weekly and gets to no
point W.D.F.: “Barker” is a bit too obvious
Gerald D.; Instead of mildly suggesting a number of
things, why not try to say something strongly
and clearly? E.H. (St. Hilda) : The first stanza
would spoil anything. .. .M.W.M.: Choked with
commonplaces... .I.D.C.: Wanted a far stronger and
surer touch Syd S.: Not an acceptable sort of
yarn. .. .Bellerive: Very seasonable verse:—
You’ve admired within a garden a fragrant blushing
Rose ;
When smitten with the sneezes, that’s the color of
my nose. ’
’Tis awkward in a crow T ded tram to have to sniff
and splutter
Till tears doth trickle from your eyes and your
very ears doth flutter.
I burn a piece of camphor, and inhale it through
the day,
A sure and simple remedy, to drive the cold away.
.... F.Q. (Queanbeyan) : The grammar goes wild in
the first line T.E. (Townsville): Get more know-
ledge about the subjects you handle C.M. (Byron
Bay): Not well enough presented... .E.S.L.: Far
below standard.... Matai: A long, dreary attempt
to say that two people happened to do the same
thing J.O. (Glen Innes) : Has points, but not
enough.... Emanuel G.: Second-rate detective stories
are not wanted G.A.M.: A thin yarn badly tangled.
T.W.D.: Utterly futile Wizard: Horrible
John R.: Not dreadful, but without anything of
interest A.T.A.: Misses... .M.G. (Bendigo) : Hasn t
enough force for a shocking example... .J.A. (New-
market) : The goats can’t trespass here in verse like
that... .W.H.L.: The verses are heavy in movement.
They resemble a bad imitation of the poorest pass-
ages in “Paradise Regained”... .Felix W.: The yarn
doesn’t convince. Men don’t change their opinions
for such ridiculous reasons. .. .A. Q. (Brisbane): Even
as a first attempt it is poor... .B.W.C.: Not nearly
enough in it Edward D.: The barking of dogs
is not a model for literary style... .J.S.G.-. You
say the fame of the land whose “rivers are com-
posed of mud” shall “vibrate to Gehenna’s gates.”
The verse is composed of much the Same material
and vibrates to the basket. .. .A.D.F.: Limps along
lamely .C.W.H.: The lines say nothing and the
stuff can hardly be called verse.... Tarwoona ; That
kind of manufactured yarn leaves us very cold....
C. L. (Roseville) : The sketch is in fair form, but
the material is too slight. .. .M.E.T.: Not nearly. ...
M.B.S.: Wistful wonderings about commonplaces....
Dudley G.: Very weak; and not improved by the
“doth” and “dost”... .P.B.S.: You twist words to
make them fit the lines, leave out your adjectives
and pad out with print-worn phrases, but some lines
are not altogether bad....C.L. (Auckland): Some-
where on the way, but the yarn is not very clear
F.D.; The verse says nothing fresh and in the mass
amounts to nothing J.S.C.: Very poor stuff
Ripponlea: It raises an important question in natural
history:—
I’ve often wonder’d if cats could tell the time!
A cat had been dozing by the fire
Until after mother’s boarders did retire;;
Then out the door and o’er the fence did she climb.
’Twas a moonlit night that day;
There was a hint of pickle-factories in the air.
The time was midnight or there-
Abouts. The cat across the road did stray.
Much quicker than it takes to tell,
As soon as the clock struck twelve-thirty
The cat hit the air, quick and dirty;
Although as I have remarked, ’twas but twelve!
Preoccupied by absorbing thoughts, mayhap,
She sat across the tram-line at twelve;
Little dreaming that her life might end in a
squeaking squelch
Should the last tram cut short her nap.
P.L.L.: The yarn is old and tired Emel: The
verse doesn’t carry it... .A.J.S.: Doesn’t get near.
Fidus Achates: Very ragged J.M.H.: Un-
clean without being either amusing or convincing.
A.L.H.: You might get to something if you
took enough trouble, but you have some distance to
go... .L.Z. (Blackwood): Old commonplaces in weak
verse E.M.T.: No good S.S. (Innisfail) : Does
not carry enough interest.... S.B. (Ringwood) : The
yarn goes back... .C.R.S.: The ideas are too flimsy.
R.D.Y.: The burglar yarn doesn’t convince....
Leamington: The verse is of the poorest kind....
P. : The lines are crude and lumpy and the
theme is old and weary Dorothy K.: Too slight.
....Tyro; They don’t get anywhere near P.O.
MacC.: Feeble little flutters Arthur M.: The yarn
goes heavily D.P.F.O.: The mirth is too angular
and gritty F.D.L.: You’ll have to love in a
less commonplace phrasing before you see print
F.P. (Westport) : One is not new; the other doesn’t
matter.
TO ARTISTIC (AND INARTISTIC)
CORRESPONDENTS.
R.L.N.: Painlessly destroyed, as requested....
E.M.E.: Near-art, very distant humor E.E.C.:
They have traces of originality. One may do as
a suggestion. .. .A.C.: No....M.G.: “The much-
relished start” will never be made from that stable.
“Lord”: Some meddling idiot rescued that gag
from the Burning of the Books (second century,
b.c.) A.E.: One is a horrible pun, horribly
illustrated; the other is nasty, impolite and still
more horribly illustrated. The horse, which is not
such a bad horse, is probably stolen... .N.H.W.: Not
up... .T.R.F.: Only reminiscences....D.McI.: Artisti-
cally speaking, you came into this world too soon.
. .. .H.W.T.: No improvement... .M.J., T.H., R.Y.
and others: Please note the Yankee Fleet is now in
the vicinity of Maoriland.

Business, Robbery, etc.
“Alwyn”: My nominee as an all-round
utility man is the occupant ot' an unpreten-
tious East Sydney dwelling, who, per
medium of a conspicuously displayed painted
sign, pretentiously designates ids modest
abode as an “Academy of Music,” and who
undertakes for a modest consideration to
impart lessons in the following: Violin,
viola, ’cello, bass, flute, cornet, euphonium,
trombone, mandoline, mandola, zither, guitar
and voice-production. At a near-by
hostelry I heard it said that he augments
his income by clipping horses on Sundays.

"Loud : This goes' under Business and
Ilobbery. A London insurance co. lifts just
bowled out a syndicate of motor-car thieves.
It suspected the so-called garage, and sent
a private detective posing as an Australian
with a desire to take a second-hand So-and-
so car home with him. lie was pressed to
buy various other makes, but insisted on
having a So-and-so, and presently one was
produced. As anticipated, it proved to be
one lately stolen in the district. The syn-
dicate possessed hardly any of the makes
they offered, and under pressure they
admitted that they had “marked down”
privately-owned cars of various makes, and
were prepared to steal any one of them that
might be desired by a customer who was
sure to take it quickly out of the district.
* * * *
“L. 1.0.”: lie revised signs (B. 23/7/’25).
When Melbourne’s first lady pharmacist
started business, a sign painted in large
letters on the brick side of her shop an-
nounced “Mrs. Blank, Chemist.” Some
humorists got busy the same night with a
paintpot. They put a possessive “s” after
the name and altered the “t” in Chemist to
an “e.” Nowadays such an announcement
would merely be taken for the title of a new
bedroom play*
r ■* *
“Veronal”: Touching early attempts at
meat preservation, it is 60 years or more
since James Manning, brother of the forensic
William, started a small enterprise at Pam-
bula (N.S.W.). The meat was, I think, pre-
served by the sulphur-dioxide process; beef
mostly was canned. London expert opinion
pronounced the product fair, but the
company didn’t long survive. Another local
enterprise fared much better. Matthew
Munn’s Maizena Co., which transferred its
activities from Merimbula to Panbula about
the same time, won enduring fame, and liis
floury product is still in the market.

“Kritz : "Simon’ (B. 11/6/’25) may like
to know that for the past two years all the
lighters on the n.-w. coast of W.A. have
been using old motor tyres for chafing gear.
Some of these tiny craft, forced to dis-
charge ships in afl weathers on account of
tides and the absence of jetties, get a pretty
rough time, and have-found old tyres both
economical and durable rope fenders.
* . » <*
“Armchair”: If the Australian letter-
sender did follow the Yankee practice of
writing his own name and address on the
lapel of the envelope (B. 25/6/’25) lie would
be no better off. Our postal regulations re-
quire that such letters, if undeliverable, must
be opened and re-addressed, unless there is
also an endorsement asking for their return
if unclaimed for a certain period.
“S.T.S.”: Coincidences almost incredible
are not confined to the big things of life.
Over four years ago I bought my first car,
second-hand. Last week I bought a new
one, the vendors taking the old bne in part
payment. On inquiry at the licensing office,
a form which I had never seen before was
handed me for completion, “Having dis-
posed of my So-and-So, I ask to retain the
old number. Verified by (purchaser of me
old car) ” —and so on. Within one hour from
my getting this, a visitor dropped in : “You
won’t remepiber me, but I sold you a
second-hand car some years ago. 1 have
only just bought another car, and find an
application for the old number has to be
made. Would you mind verifying this?”
And lie produced—after a delay of four
years—the twin form to that of my new
experience.

Professor VVood-Jones, of Adelaide Uni-
versity, who has always taken a special inter-
est in Australia’s marsupials, has been
urging in a lecture the big possibilities of
fur-farming. There are, he says, quite a
thousand such farms in Canada and the
U.S.A., and prices are going up every year.
A fur-seal skin is now worth anything up to
£4O. Australia seems content to deal in
rabbits, of which 90,000,000 a year are sent
to the United Kingdom. The Professor
would like to see really valuable animals,
such as the Tasmanian black opossum, reared
carefully for commercial purposes, and killed
as carefully when necessary, the present
methods of shooting and trapping being all
wrong. Wood-Jones adds that Australia has
done itself a lot of harm by the destruction
of its marsupials, plagues of rats, mice and
grasshoppers being largely due' to this cause.
* * # *
"E.S.” : For a tithe of the money that is
brine spent on immigration the Northern
Territory might be prospected by practical
miners and new goldfields discovered. It was
Ballarat that set Australia going, and old
miners believe that there are Ballarats hid-
den in the Great Emptiness. Gold and othei
minerals have been found in many widely
separated places. Creeks draining into the
Katherine contain various gems, besides gold
and tin, and it was there that one of the
largest Australian diamonds was found.
West Queensland opal-gougers, too, be-
lieve that good opal will be found in
Central Australia. Much of that region re-
sembles the north-western part of N.S.W.,
which produces silver, "-old and opal, besides
a fourth (or is it a fifth?) of the world’s out-
put of lead.

“11. K." : The first insurance company in
Australia was established exactly 110 years
ago by Alexander Biley and Richard Jones,
importers. The pair restricted themselves
to marine insurance. In an 1816 issue of
the Gazette appeared an intimation of their
having been appointed as Lloyd’s agents at
Port Jackson.


The CONVENIENT, SAFE and
ECONOMICAL way to handle Petrol
*odel 364
The most efficient, one
gallon, long distance
pump on the market.
Pumps one gallon tit
each stroke of the pis-
ton, intermediate stops
for smaller quantities.
Meter optional
Wherever petrol is used in substantial
quantities, it should be stored safely
underground and dispensed as needed by
means of an accurate measuring pump,
with meter that records the exact amounts
used. Thus you can maintain a perfect
check on total consumption, as well as the
individual amount of petrol each tractor,
truck or other unit consumes.
The ideal equipment for this purpose is
Wayne Pump No. 364. It is compact
and accurate, simple to install and re-
markably easy to operate. While it is

Diamond Rings
OF IMPERISHABLE BEAUTY
Faultlessly) Fashioned in
Artistic Designs.
Diamonds differ widely in value, for Nature refuses to standardise.
For every perfect diamond to come from the hands of the cutters there
are others that approximate it in color, fire, beauty; many others which,
though less valuable, are still of authentic quality and dependable commer-
cial value ; and, finally, a vast quantity below this level —diamonds that
must be made to look better than they are in order to find purchasers.
These are not good value, however low the price may be.
It follows that the intending purchaser of diamonds must compare values
r ire carefully than in the case of any other merchandise. Fairfax and
Roberts have had me r eighty years’ experience and are glad to assist
you in making this comparison as thorough as possible.

tradition of producing the per-
fect pipe, made by hand by
skilled London craftsmen, from the
finest naturally matured briar —a pipe
which is regarded as “the best of alt ”
in the Mother Country.

WRITE FOR ILLUSTRATED BOOKLET, BOX 555 G.P.O. SYDNEY, N.S.W.
The materials for a noble smash are being
accumulated in Australia. The output of
local industry is diminished by the reduc-
tion of working hours and other causes. The
influx of foreign goods promises to be a re-
cord this year, thanks to the Bruce-Page
crowd’s futility in tariff matters, and that
also helps industry on the downward slide.
Borrowing (State and Federal) has climbed
to £50,000,000 a year or more, and interest
bills are paid in London out of new borrow-
ings. The old, reliable lender shows signs
of exhaustion, or scare. What wonder that
foreign revolutionary bodies are perking up?
S.A. Supreme Court has admitted to the
Bar two young lawyers with distinguished
war service behind them. W. F. J. McCann
has the unique record of starting as a pri-
vate with the 10tli Battalion and finishing
as its commanding officer. He is now presi-
dent of the R.S.S.L. F. M. Cutlack is an
Adelaide journalist (latterly of Sydney) who
was in England in 1914 and enlisted there,
ultimately becoming an official historian of
the A.I.F. The same day W. L. Yon Doussa
was admitted, on the motion of his grand-
father, Louis Von IX, who has had over
half a century at the Bar. Also Josiah
Symon, the veteran K.C., has, while on a
visit to London, seen his youngest son, Oliver,
“called” at the Inner Temple, after much
naval service in Australian destroyers and
elsewhere.
“The Deacon” : How’s this for varied occu-
pations? A young Yorkshireman, having
abandoned his medical career, shipped on a
limejuicer before the mast and worked up to
a mate’s ticket. Going into steam, he put
in eight months bringing out a tug to New-
castle and spent ten years on her off the
Australian coast. From salvaging wrecks
he passed to pearling; then the city called
him once more, and he finished up a Uni.
dental course and acquired a thriving prac-
tice. He gave that up to become licensee
of a. country pub. He is still only in the
early forties.
“lan C.”: As Alex. Peacock, Yic. State
Treasurer, stood with bowed head at Tren-
with’s graveside at Brighton Cemetery, I
wonder if he recalled the incident of 23 years
ago, when a mistaken act of good nature on
the part of 12 of his colleagues in his first
Ministry brought about the Government’s
downfall. The 12 signed a letter indicating
readiness to resign to give Peacock a free
hand in the reconstruction of the Cabinet.
Trenwith, who was Chief Sec. and Minister
for Railways, was not one of the signatories.
Irvine (now C.J.), who wak then Opposition-
leader, indicted the Ministry for continuing
to carry on after it had virtually committed
suicide. Of course, the House could not re-
sist a “charge” of that kind, more particu-
larly when Toutcher, the amateur Whip, had
taken the precaution to count heads and
make sure of the numbers in advance. So
Trenwith was the Ministerial martyr. It
was Trenwith’s last taste of office, as he
went to the Senate in the following year.
Of the 10 who represented Vic. at the
Federal Convention (1897-98) only Peacock,
Isaacs, Higgins and Quick now remain. Pea-
cock is Vic. Treasurer; Isaacs and Higgins
are High Court Justices; and Quick is a
Federal Arbitration Court Judge.
“Centurion”: The fate of the Sydney
restaurant patron who choked himself with
a mouthful of steak and sat at table for an
hour or so before his plight was discovered,
recalls a famous Scottish parallel. Four
old-time lairds started on a claret-drinking
bout, and carried on well into the evening of
the next day. About that time one of them,
gazing about him, remarked that the host
at the other end of the table was not look-
ing too well. He said to his neighbor, using
the territorial title after the Scottish fashion :
“Pitabrig, man, Galashiels looks gey gash.”
Said Pitabrig in reply, squinting over his
bumper of claret: “Gash, ye may weel say
sac; man, lie’s been deid these sax hoors!”
“Frinigga”: One being that surprised
our American visitors is the Australian bar-
maid, still surviving though not as invari-
able as she used to be. Uncounted years be-
fore their own country went legally Dry, it
had decided that behind a bar, at the con-
versational mercy of any more-or-less fuddled
loafer, is precisely not the place for a woman.
“Bar-tender” was the official name for the
cocktail-mixer; and any visiting Englishman
who wrote “Bart.” after his name was always
liable to be asked jokingly if it was a con-
traction for the other and more honored title.
“Ledraw” : Speakingof things that find their
way accidentally into ballot-boxes, I was
once poll-clerk at an election on the N.S.W.
Northern Rivers. The second man who arrived
to record his vote was charged with stimu-
lants as well as party enthusiasm, and
dropped in all his spending silver with his
ballot-paper. The box in this case had to
be taken to Ballina, 10 miles away. En-
couraged by an advance of two bob on
account, the inebriate made so many calls
for his cash during the day that the local
John had to intervene. The box finally re-
turned 4s. 3d. The ex-owner’s remarks
when I tried to deduct the advance were so
strong that I waived my claim on the 2s.
to get rid of him.
“Hamer”: A regular contributor periodi-
cally hires seven inches of space in a Mel-
bourne daily to voice an unusual grievance
in closely packed type. His quarrel is with
the Seventh Day Adventists, because they
say that Saturday is the real Sabbath, and
even as the Communist reserves his bitterest
condemnation for the Laborite, so is this per-
son’s wrath specially directed against those
who only go half-way in his direction: he is
convinced that Friday is the day legitimately
entitled to recognition as that upon which
the Creator rested from His labors. Accord-
ingly he addresses his argument to Advent-
ists in countless paragraphs of Scripture
bearing his own interpretations, and chal-
lenges them to confute his contentions. It
seems a profitless sort of business: but the
paper’s advertising department isn’t worry-
ing.
“Six and Eight”: Don’t know precisely
when Dubbo (N.S.W.) was named, but it
was certainly before the ’seventies (B.
23/7/’25). The N.S.W. Gazetteer of 1866
describes it as a township of 400 inhabitants
with post, money-order and telegraph offices,
a court of petty sessions, a newspaper and
two banks. There were also four pubs.

The Ballad of St. Osric.
[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
knights had sworn by throe and
three
To seek the Grail of God,
When spring was white on the liawthoin-
tree
And green on the osier rod.
A stranger knight was in the hall,
A man of might and worth ;
Ho gave his name before them all —
Sir Osric of the North.
His blue eye had a heathen look
When at the Cross he stood;
And ill his knee had learned to crook
Before the holy wood.
Yet loud he swore the questing oath
And raised his iron glove,
As if the Christ and Mary both
Had won his fiercer love.
And on the quest he rode as one
Whose holy passion glows
Beneath the stars, beneath the sun
For some strange thing he knows.
They rode the laughing springtime down
Across a land of. trees ;
They trod the yellow summer brown
And came to autumn seas.
And once at dusk of heavy day
He heard a convent bell
Far ringing through the misty grey
Of maiden faith to tell.
A comrade knight bowed low his head—
“ The Christ has all my love.”
“And mine,” Sir Osric hoarsely said,
And sternly gazed above.
Then in a tide of time they came
To golden halls and towers,
Sharp spires that lit with evening flame
And helms that glowed like flowers.
Upon the hill were cedar-trees,
With yellow lawns between,
And Paynim banners on the breeze
And spears in starry sheen.
And one with challenge bade them stay.
"We keep the Grail,” lie cried;
“If you would bear the Cup away
Look well where others died.”
Where low the hill stooped to the plain
There lay in all men’s sight
The relies of ten thousand slain,
Bones that the winds bleached white.
Yet not for these would any stay.
Straight to the onset came
That eager throng, with lust to slay
In Christ’s most holy name.
The Paynim host for battle shock
Stood'armed in iron mail.
A wall as if of living rock
That stood to guard the Grail.
Till bold Sir Osric, with a shout
T'nheard till then, bore down- —
Mahound himself had quaked with doubt
For Heathenrie’s renown.
Their ranks were cleft, their banner fell;
Such blood was there to spill
To maiden swords, the ranks of Hell
Seemed broken on the hill.
And under the red cedar-trees
Was sudden woe and wail.
As. white plumes waving in the breeze,
They rode to win the Grail.
The white plumes brightened in the sun,
Each crest a blood-red stain,
Nor reeked they that the knight who won
The hill had drawn his rein.
Bown on tlrcir knees in utmost prayer
Around the Grail they fell.
Great quiet lay upon the air ■
And scents of asphodel.
And all men knejuv the gates were wide
Of Paradise In at eve :
And Christ, through deeds, His holy Bride
Stood waiting to receive.
But in the silence came a horn
Blown hard by sudden hate.
A challenge call that seemed to scorn
The very deeps of fate.
The knights in fearful haste arose.
“To horse ! To horse !” they cried.
“Mahound alone such challenge blows
Where all his bravest died.”
Beneath the darkened cedar shade—-
For now the sun had set—
They saw Sir Osric with his blade
Yet bared and reeking wet.
“I challenge no man here,” he said;
“Bring forth the Christ ye own.
As man to man above these dead
I challenge Him alone !
“lie took my bride to be His bride
In a convent of the North.
By all I hold of love or pride
I charge you bring Him forth!”
The knights drew trembling from that word
In fear and wrath and shame.
They said “Pic tempts the mighty sword
Of Michael, red with flame.”
But. out of Heaven the far-heard voice
n OE a silver trumpet rang.
The trumpet that bade earth rejoice
When the sons of morning sang.
I nder the soft dark cedar-tree
Came One in robes of light
M ith a voice that seemed like the memory
Of music in the night.
And by His side a maiden stood,
As fair as an April day,
A ith the lilies of God on her silken hood
And her bright hair blown astray.
T'U' Knight, you have won to the Holy Grail
That stood on death’s black brink.
*" the cup of joy that shall not fail
From which God dare not drink.
l or God were the king of Heathenrie.
No other gods above,
B a man have broken Hell on bis knee
And be denied of love.”
N.S.W.

“Bloody Bill.”
[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
IT lias before been related in these pages
—in a story entitled “Joan of Jor-
dan’s”—how Lieutenant Gregory
Wicks, R.N., and Ensign Calder. of H.M.
46th Foot, had the great misfortune to be
amongst tiie victims of Authority upon the
memorable occasion when Mr. D’Arcy Went-
worth, the Superintendent of Police, acting
in conjunction with the Provost-Marshal,
employed a force of constables and soldiers
in the raiding of the cockpit conducted by
Mr. Daniel Jordan at the rear of his licensed
house, the Bold Colonial. That veracious
fragment of history explains, too. how Mr.
Pilkington, of the Commissariat, came to be
saved from a similar fate by the somewhat
passionately good offices of pretty Joan
Jordan, who afterwards married Farmer
Tony Stnrrock, of Freeman’s Reach, on the
Hawkesbury River, became the mother of
half a dozen tall Cornstalks of either sex,
and now lies beneath a quaintly-lettered
sandstone slab in old St. Matthew’s church-
yard at Windsor (N.S.W.), to which some-
times her great-great-grandchildren make
curious pilgrimage after morning service on
Sundays—not so well aware as they might
be that the old bones mouldering below were
once the framework of the comeliest Cur-
rency Lass in Australia during the middle
period of Governor Macquarie’s long reign
as its autocrat.
But it has not yet been told how Mr.
Calder came to be the proprietor of a well-
bred gamecock, and to figure very briefly
as one of the Masters of the Match—as they
used to designate the owner of a combatant
bird in cockfighting days—in the lamentably
interrupted battle which never came to a
conclusion on a certain summer night, not
long before Christmas, in the year of our
Lord 1816. That is the intention which
underlies the present instalment of the
memoirs of Lieut.-Colonel Calder, Captain
Wicks, R.N., and Arthur Moon-field Pilking-
ton, Esq., J.P., of the Upper Hunter River.
Whether it does entire justice to Mr. William
Gilhooley, who really has the principal part
in it, its compiler is a little uncertain, but may
conscientiously claim that he has tried to
be as fair as possible to that picturesque
personality.
About October, in the year above men-
tioned, we find Messrs. Calder and Wicks
seated over their wine at the hour of sunset
round the hospitable board of Mr. Pilking-
ton, in the cosy cottage wherein he dwelt
upon the Rocks of old Sydney. They had
dined well and sufficiently, and the not-to-be-
despised culinary efforts of William Larkins,
Mr. Pilkington’s versatile and efficient,
housekeeper-cook-valet, had induced that
comfortable frame of mind which renders
the debate and discussion of matters of im-
port less irksome than they might other-
wise be.
“Well, then, Patwick.” remarked Mr. Pil-
kington. refilling his empty wineglass and
pushing the decanter of port across the pol-
ished surface of the round, red-cedar table
towards Mr. Wicks, “I take it that you are
weally in earnetht about thith buthincth —•
that you have definitely dethided to twade
with thith fellow ‘Bloody Bill’ —to 'pur
cliathe hith phenomenal gamecock?”
“Right you are, Brummell, my buck —
that’s it exactly,” replied Mr. Calder, un-
buttoning his red jacket for his better cor-
poreal comfort. “I really think, apart from
any sporting considerations, ’tis a very sound
investment. Me and Pansy here” —lie pointed
the stem of his churchwarden pipe at the
blue-clad naval-officer opposite—“we’re not
such wealthy devils as you are, you know.
Poor, poverty-stricken swine, with not much
else besides our pay. So it behoves us to
turn an honest penny whenever we haye the
opportunity. Such chances as this don’t
often come our way. Dam’ foolish not to
take advantage of ’em when they do.”
“Pwav. what are you a-going to pay Gil-
hooley for the bird. Patwick?”
“Pay him? Well, it’s a sort of a trade,
you know. He wants ten guineas and my
bay mare Janet that’s out to grass with
Mr. Suttor at Baulkham Hills. Seems a
good deal in his favor. I’ll admit: but, then,
the bird’s got a pedigree as long as your
arm, and Bloody Bill says there's nothing
in the settlement will be able to stand up
to him—and lie’s a pretty good judge. I
think I ought to get my money back in no
time—even if you call the mare worth 25
guineas. Prize-money and wagers—but prin-
cipally wagers. The bird’s never been
matched before, though Gilhooley’s tried him
out several times. A born fighter, he says,
A terror. Should easily mean at least
a couple of hundred guineas to me before he’s
finished. A d—d sound speculation. I call
it. Wouldn’t you like to come in with me,
Brummell? I don’t want to be selfish
about it.”
Mr. Pilkington raised his right hand de-
precntingly and shook his head.
“No, no, Patwick, though I thank you for
your genenvouth offer. I mutht think of my
potliition, you underthtand. I have good
gwoundth for believing that hith Ecthel-
lenthy doth not in the leatlit appwove of
cock-fightin’. Indeed. Mrs. Macquawie oneth
told me ath much. But I think. Patwick —•
I think I’d hethitate about a-going into a
deal with Bloody Bill Gilhooley unathithted.
A wily fellow. I’ve had dealingth with tin*
gentleman, over wheat and maithe, to thay
nothing of pork. Wemarkably athtute per-
thon for one whoth entirely illiterwate.
Thignth hith name .with an X mark, but
ath cunning ath ten devilth, nevertlieletli.
Thuppothing, Patwick, you were to invite
Panthy and me to athitht you in the matter?
I’m thure we'd only be too glad to lend you
our morwal thupport in bargaining with
Bloody Bill —wouldn't we, Gwegory?”
, “Oh, I suppose so.” responded the good-
natured Mr. Wicks.
“Oh. well, now” —Mr. Calder waved his
pipe at his two friends in suitable acknow-
ledgment of their friendly offer —“I call it
uncommon decent of ye both. Not that I
have any great apprehension as to my treat-
ment at the hands of Bloody Bill —but, of
course, three heads are better than one in
a business like this. Could you get a couple
of days from the Commissary—say, the day
after to-morrow —-Brummell?”
“My dear fellow, I have the chief of my

“And you, Pansy?”
“Oh, yes—there's a lot of leave due to

“Good!” said Mr. Calder. “Then I pro-

* * * *
Mr. William Gilhooley, of Portland Head
—the place where stands the oldest temple
of Christian worship south of the Cape of
Good Hope, or at least of the Dutch East
Indies —had not been unduly favored of
feature by Providence. He was, indeed, one
of the ugliest men in New South Wales, and
there was something in his aspect of trucu-
lent, savage fierceness that rendered his nick-
name peculiarly appropriate. He had been
a butcher by trade in the old country, but,
for some time prior to his transportation on
a charge of manslaughter for a term of 14
years, had been employed as an attendant
at that classic home of the more gory
branches of British sport, Hockley-in-tlie-
Hole. He was an authority in the diversions
of cockfighting, bear- and bull-baiting, duck-
hunting, rat-catching and such like eigli-
teenth-century brutalities, and no man
could revel more joyously, or with such naive
abandon, in anything relating to the. torture
and death of God’s creatures, the spilling of
their blood, the agonies of their dissolution
and their final expiring struggles. He had
once volunteered to hang a man at the Toon-
gabbie stockade, and that was the occasion
when the Tlev. Samuel Marsden —no squeam-
ish apostle—remarked of him : “That man
Gilhooley! By heavens, I believe the fel-
low’d be* a cannibal if he had opportunity!”
He was a very notable breeder of gam*
fowl, of bull-terriers, and of pugnacious cats.
His little farm near Portland Head, where he
lived with a cross-eyed murderess named Sal
the Slut —early colonial nicknames in the
society which Mr. Gilhooley ornamented in-
clined to coarseness^ —was a resort of had
characters from up and down the river iu
search of those brutal amusements which had
afforded them entertainment at home before
they had come overseas at the behest of
their peers and his Majesty’s judges. The
rails of his stockyard on Sunday mornings—
when it did duty as a cockpit or as an-arena,
for dog-lights—were wont to be ornamented
with as choice a collection as it would be
possible to gather together anywhere or at
any time. And over these delightful assem-
blages of “sports” Bloody Bill presided as a
sort of Head Devil—brutally jovial and
obscenely facetious.
But it was not alone his appearance or
his personal characteristics that had earned
him his title. His manner of speech had as
much to do with the origin of the nickname
as anything else. What has been termed the
Great Australian Adjective was apparently
essential to the translation of his processes
of thought into sound-symbols. Without its
use he would have been tongue-tied.
It was a week-day when Messrs. Calder,
Wicks and Pilkington arrived at Mr. Gil-
hooley's farm, and no gathering of the
fraternity of Hawkesbury “sports” was in
progress. The little parliament assembled
before his slab-and-bark hut consisted solely
of Bloody Bill, Sal the Slut and the three
young gentlemen. The lady smoked a clay
pipe and stood looking on, her brawny arms
folded across her ample bosom, and her
squinting gaze wandering from one to the
other of the bargaining quartette as they
argued over the trading of the gamecock
for Mr. (’aider's mare and sundry of his
guineas. It was with the exact amount of
these latter to be handed over to Mr. Gil-
hooley that the debate had most to do.
Down below them the placid river flowed
between its high, wooded hills, reflecting the
Clear blueness of a cloudless sky; and the
emerald green of the young crop of maize
in the log-fenced cultivation paddock, in a
bend that had been filled during the ages with
rich alluvial, was in vivid contrast with the
sombre bush that covered the ridges and the
ranges behind them.
“We think, Farmer Gilhooley,” Mr. Pil-
kington was saying—“we art; of a unani-
mouth opinion that your termifh, with wegard
to the financial tliide of the twanthaction,
are, to put it mildly, a little eflthethive. Now
don’t yon think tho yourthelff?”
“My —- oath, I don’t, Mir. Pilking-
ton,” replied Mr. Gilhooley, nursing his
gamecock in his arms. “Not a bit
too much. This hyer bird’s a
—— swell bird, so lie is. None well
like in th’ colony. He ain’t no
dunghill breed, this covey ain’t. ’Tis
a sacrifice for to let un go at th’
price I’m namin’. My oath, it is !”
“That’s right, Bill,” grumbled Sal, spit-
ting in the dust with emphasis. “Don’t, ’ee
let un go for less, elst I’ll break y’r -
hugly ’ead wi.’ a hoe.”
“There ye well are, gents., th’ missus
’as ’or feelin’s th’ same as me. We
both of us can’t abear for to part wi’ th’
—— bird for less nor wot I well say.”
“Ten guinea’th ith too much. Altogether
too much when you take into consideration
the value of Mr. Calder’s mare. Why, he
refuthed £4O for her fworn Captain Blake,
the adjutant, didn’t you, Patwick?”
“Fifty,” corrected Mr. Calder.
“How much o’ th’ brass mought ye
be a-thinkin’ o’ well puttin’ up, then?”
inquired the bird’s owner, sdbwling at Mr.
Calder snd obviously sceptical as to the
reported liberality of the ad|utant’s offer for
the mare.
“Five gnineatli an’ five gallonth of rum—•
the betht Bengal,”
“There ain’t nio best Bengal; ’tis all
rotgut. Lqokee now, Mr., — T — Pilking-
ton —an’ Mr. Calder, sir—make it. five
guineas an* ten, gallons ’o’ West
Injy, au' I won’t go for to say as I moughn’t
well think it hover.”
Instantly Mr. Pilkington closed the deal.
“Done with you, Gilliooley. Ten gallonth
of Jamaica, five guinea tli and the mare—
and I think you’ve made a very good bar-
gain. You’ve beaten utli handthomely. But
I know Mr. Calder’th anxiouth to hsve the
bird —at almotht any cotlit. ’Tith wobbery,
of courthe, but never mind. That’ll do. If
you’ll put the bird in a bag we’ll get away.
We want to dine in Windthor and get back
to town to-night. Our leave ecthpireth to-
morrow morning.”
Mr. Wicks, during the drive back to Wind-
sor, was in high spii-its, roaring sea-songs at
the top of his voice, hailing joyously the
inhabitants of the three or four farms they
passed by on the way, and generally making
manifest his delight with the mere fact of
being alive. But Mr. Oalder was glum and
silent as he nursed the bag upon his knee,
from a hole in which protruded the truculent
headpiece of the gamecock. The possession
of the coveted bird which was to make lxis
fortune did not seem, after all, to give him
that lively satisfaction which might have
been expected.
“Look here, Brummell,” he said as they
sat at dinner in the coffee-room of the Mac-
quarie Arms in Windsor, “I’ll be d —d if
I think you made such a good bargain with
that fellow Gilliooley as you seem to think
you did.”
“And, pway, why don’t you think tho, my
dear Patwick?”
“Well, that West Indian rum. If we ran
possibly get hold of ten gallons of the stuff
’twill only be at the Devil’s own price. You
know well there hasn’t been any in the
colony for months past—except what a few
people hold for their own consumption as a
luxury. There’s not a drop to be had in
our mess, I know that. And Pansy’s skip-
per’s as likely to let me have any from the
ship’s stores as he is to present me with the
contents of the powder-magazine or the
planking of the quarter-deck. I think _ I’m
in a hole, and that you’ve put me there.”
Mr. Pilkington laid down his knife and
fork, and quizzed his friend through his eye-
glass. A little smile played about his well-
shaped mouth. When he spoke it was with
the air of one who has vanquished and over-
come all difficulties, and is justly conscious
of the possession of a degree of astuteness
that is beyond the ordinary.
“Well, now, Patwick, my dear boy—ordi-
narily I detetht thubterfuge. But thome-
timeth twickery mutht be met with twickery.
Our friend Bloody Bill ith one whom I
conthider it entirely legitimate to employ
artifithe upon. We have in the C'om-
mitliarwiat Thtoreth a conthiderable quan-
tity of Bengal rum that ith unfit for ithue, it
having been thpoilt by thea-water on the
voyage fwom Calcutta to Port Jacktlion. It
ith for thale dirt cheap. Altlio we have
thundry empty barrelth and kegth marked
‘Betht Jamaica.’ Do you follow me? Takin’
the facth into contliiderwation, I am pothi-
tive that you have got the betht of Bloody
Bill. You thee?”
Slowly a grin spread over Mr. Calder’s
countenance.- Mr. Wicks guffawed d«- 4
lightedly.
“Brummell,” he bellowed, “you’re ?v d—d
genius!”
* -* *
Out at Mr. Gilhooley’s farm Sal the Slut
was nursing a broken head, and was elo-
quent of apology to her man. “I’m sorry,
Bill,” she said humbly when he came back
from his work in the evening. “I’m sorry
I spoke rough to ye this marnin’. I didn’t
know. Ye done right to crack me.”
“O’ coorse I done Avell right, ye
baggage, ye. If that there Hensign Galder can
gePthat there bird to fight w’en he puts
’im in th’ ——• cockpit I’m a —— Dutch-
man. ’E ain’t no gamecock at. all —on’y a
—— mongrel wot’s ’ardly good enough for
th’ pot. D’ye think I’d waste a good bird
on them? Not Bill Gilliooley. let me
well tell ’ee, Sal, my gal! I’ve still
got tlr rightful bird. My oath!”

For tide upon a clock-face man’s captured
longings run.
Sense, that serves man’s hunger, chains him
to a board;
Love, that binds the savage, ties him to a
child;
Anchorage, that stays him, sends no sail
abroad
Where, whatever mast may buckle, every
wind is toward.
Summertime is ended,
Liberty is spended,
For, fetter-locked to home, sits the master
of the wild!
