“THE BULLETIN” BOOK EXCHANGE
On receipt at The Bulletin Office, Sydney, of Postal Order, Postal Notes, or Stamps equal
to the price stated, books in the subjoined list will be forwarded to any Australasian address:—
Mining' Books.
There are dozens and scores of mining hand-books, and not one that can be
wholly recommended. As a rule, practical men can’t write, and theorists don’t
know; and the result is that books professedly simple are generally so technical as
to be hopelessly beyond the grasp of the average miner, or even of the instructed
one. Then, again, the treatises extant are mostly published in America and Eng-
land, and deal with American and English conditions. Rudimentary principles, of
course, are everywhere the same ; but the Australian application of principles is, for
the most part, totally different in detail. The result is that every miner has to get
his knowledge by the painful old rule-o’-thumb process, falling into precisely the pit-
falls which have snared his predecessors, and winning his way to success, if he ever
reaches it, through difficulties and losses which previous experience should have
saved him from. The undermentioned books are defective from the Austra-
lian point of view, but all of them contain matter which can be turned to valu-
able account by a shrewd head. It often happens that one is puzzled as a prospector
or mine or battery manager for want of a little knowledge of how other people meet
their troubles; and much may be gained from the stored-up wrinkles of others,
however imperfectly set forth.
A PRACTICAL GUIDE TO PROSPECTORS, EXPLORERS, AND MINERS,
by C. W. Moore. Cloth, 15s. 9d.
This book is especially full and valuable in the matter of blowpipe analysis, and
many colored illustrations are added.
“ ELEMENTARY COAL-MINING,” by R. Peel. Cloth, 2s. 9d.
An overseer’s handbook.
“ THE PROSPECTOR’S FIELD-BOOK,” by F. S. Osborne. Cloth, 8s. 9d.
Endeavors to solve the prospector’s many riddles in simple language.
“THE HYDRAULIC GOLD-MINER’S MANUAL,” by T. S. G. Kirkpatrick.
Cloth, 6s. 3d.
Not at all bad, with many illustrations; and specially successful because it
confines itself definitely to one branch of the subject.
“A MANUAL OF MINING,” by M. C. Helsung. Cloth, 21s.
This is a comprehensive American treatise on engines and gear, mine-develop-
ment and working, suitable for managers who want to study up the question
thoroughly.
“THE MINER’S POCKET-BOOK,” by C. G. Lock. Leather, 13s.
“ THE MINER’S HANDBOOK,” by John Milne. Cloth, 7s. 9d.
Two very useful books for mine managers and students, with a wealth of
practical and tabular information. Lock’s is the fuller; but Milne is not to be
despised.
Pretty Prosers.
“ VIRGTNIBUS PUERISQUE,” by R. L. Stevenson. Cloth, 6s. 6d.
Essays now well-known, but as fresh as Spring, and perennially charming.
“ MY LADY NICOTINE,” by J. M. Barrie. Cloth, 6s. 6d.
A book chief among ten thousand and altogether lovely. The smoker who has
not read it has not smoked.
“ NOUGHTS AND CROSSES,”-by A. T. Quiller Couch. Cloth, 6s, 6d.
Surely the quaintest, sweetest stories ever penned, with art reaching its acme
in deliciously subtle simplicity.
“ IN A CANADIAN CANOE,” by Barry Pain, Cloth, 4s.
Sketches, verses and stories varying in merit, but with keen thought and a
clever style at the back of all.
“ PROSE FANCIES,” by Richard Le Galliennb. Cloth, 6s. 6d,
A recent book of idyllic essays, throwing the glamour of imagination over the
desert of commonplace, and transmuting lead to gold by the alchemy of exquisite
prose. “ A Borrowed Sovereign ” should be read at least six times.
“ POST PRANDIAL PHILOSOPHY,” by Grant Allen. Cloth, 4s,
In these articles Grant Allen brings his scientific knowledge and scientific train-
ing to bear effectively on subjects of the day. He is invariably clear and suggestive,
and his tendencies make always for progress.
Contemporary Science.
“THE EVOLUTION OF SEX,” by Geddes and Thomson. Cloth, 4s.
“ PHYSIOGNOMY AND EXPRESSION,” by P. Mantegazza, Cloth, 4a.
“HYPNOTISM,” by Dr. Albert Moll. Cloth. 4s.

forwarded immediately on arrival of next shipment.
Any book not in this list will be forwarded on receipt of price, particulars of
which will be given to enquirers.

No greater insult could possibly be offered
• Northern Kanaka than to take him for an
Aboriginal. Recently two Polynesians wanted to
»ue a Mackay photographer inasmuch as he had
taken a bad likeness of them—made them look
“like blaekfellow—not allee same white man.”
The latest escapade of a well-advertised
pressman. “ Run in ” one day recently he was
bailed out by a brother scribe, and could not be
found next morning. The man who went bail
gave a third scribe 10s, to hunt up the bibulous one
and pay the fine. When the court opened he had
not turned up. “ He’ll have to be here at once or
the bail will be forfeited,” said the court sergeant.
“Here,” said the officer to the bailsman, as an
afterthought, “ the magistrate doesn’t know you—

A certain sprightly raconteur , who has
since risen to legal, social, and legislative emin-
ence, and enjoys the reputation of being one of
the best and most generous friends on earth,
worked his way out to Queensland as a ship’s
steward, and began life in Australia blacking
boots in the streets. A man who came out per
same steamer was one day in town, when he
heard, in a familiar voice, “Hey, mate, come and
have a shine!” The voice was M ’s. The
former muttered something against paying for a
brush up, averring that he had always cleaned his
own boots. “To the devil with you !” jovially
retorted M . “ I don’t want your money !
Put up your foot! It’s the only way I can
‘treat ’ a friend just now.”

Row’s Assorted Bitters
CONTAIN
Row’s Dandelion Bitters.
We recommend these BITTERS to be taken
two or three times a day ; a wineglassful for an
adult, smaller quantity for children.
For General Debility, Dyspepsia, Rheumatism,
and Cutaneous Affections.
The action of dandelion, more especially upon
the liver and kidneys, is more reliable for remov-
ing all impure secretions than any otner medicinal
plant known.
Persons suffering from Skin diseases will find
these Bitters invaluable.
DIRECTIONS FOR USB.
One wineglass two or three times a day after
meals diluted with same quantity of water. For
young people about half the quantity twice a day.
They Purify the Blood and Liver.
See what a Medical Gentleman says
about them.
Messrs. E. Row and Co.
With thanks for forwarding me a bottle of your
Row’s Dandelion Bitters, and consider them most
excellent, and superior to many others that I have
previously tried. Yours faithfully, HENRY

=“= Biichn Bitters.
BARON BERZILIUS’ REPORT.
They are chiefly given in complaints of the Urinary
Organs, such as Gravel, Chronic Catarrh, morbid luita-
tion of the Bladder and Urethra, Diseases of the Prostrate
Glands, and Retention or Inconvenience of Urine, from
the loss of tone in the parts concerned in its evaouati n.
These Bitters I also recommend in Dyspepsia, in Chronic
Rheumatism and Cutanei us affections. The action of
Buchu on the human frame is more effectual on all
diseases of the Kidneys and Bladder than any other herbal
plant; and it also assists persons suffering from Skin
Diseases, causing a healthy action of the secretions and
inducing perspiration.
Row’s Steane’s Bitters.
STUDY HEALTH BY TAKING ROW’S
STEANB’S BITTERS.
The great demand throughout the colony for
these pure Bitters shows they are superior to all
others and equalled by none.
Facts Speak Louder than Words.
Read this sworn testimony from a well-known
citizen:—
Statutory Declaration.
“I, George Hewett, do hereby solemnly and
sincerely declare as follows :
“ That I feel it a duty I owe to the public to
state that I have been suffering for many years
from weakness of the stomach, so called INDI-
GESTION or DYSPEPSIA, and have been cured
by my taking two or three glasses of ROW’S
STEANE’S BITTERS a day in a little water, and
I hope others suffering from the same complaint
will be as speedily cured.
“(Signed) G. HEWETT,
“ 215 Pitt-street.
Row’s You’ll Do Bitters.
All who suffer from Chest Complaints, Cold, Coughs,
and general weakness of the Lungs, will gain more ease
and comfort from a wineglass of ROW’S YOU’LL DO
BITTERS than any cough medicine tried before.
Read what Medical men say about them—
BJERKIN, M.D.; —The Bitter is pure, and not like
others in overdoses. It has a remarkable influence on the
liver, promoting the secretions of Bile, and correcting it
when deranged, and restores healthy evacuations in oases
of habitual costiveness.
D. ECKSTROM, M. D. —888B—I find these Bitters a
most valuable and wholesome tonic, being pure and
strengthening; a stimulant to the liver, assisting diges-
tion. I therefore thus recommend them.
G. B. WOOD, M.D. —It is the purest of Bitters, and
exerts a peculiar influence over the liver.
Row’s Pepsine Bitters.
All who suffer from Weak Digestion will soon
be cured by these Bitters, taken three times a day
before meals.
Row’s Oriental Bitters.
A Splendid General Tonic, with a tumbler of
water makes a drink equal to any best Champagne.
Row’s Steane’s Wine
Is a safe and sure stimulant for the female sex or
children, for it raises and strengthens depressed
systems without producing a temporary excite-
ment to be followed by greater depression.
Persons suffering from loss of appetite and
eneral depression of spirits cannot do better than
take
ROW’S STEANE’P WINE.
It cannot harm you, but must do good to all
delicate persons. Young Ladies can take this
when suffering from general debility. It’s only a
pure tonic. Try it.
Teetotallers will find this newly-invented
TONIC answer all the purposes of a stimulant
without its intoxicating quality. It will satisfy
the cravings of nature and create a desire for food
instead of drink. As an anti-febrile is unsur-
passed. , , „
CAUTION. —When you call for these ask for
ROW’S, and take no substitute.

Mrs. M. A. CUMMING,

« About a year ago, I had a severe attack
of Influenza, which left me very weak, with-
out energy, appetite, or interest in life.
Obtaining little or no relief from doctors, or
from the many remedies recommended to
me, I finally tried Ayer’s Sarsaparilla and,

from that time, I began to gain health and

sults of its use. I consider it the best blood-

"The Handbook of Anarchy.”
Editor Bulletin,— l ask you, in the
interests of liberty, to print the following notes
on the prosecutions which sent me to gaol.
First, as to the legal aspect. 1. The summons
charged me with not having the name and place
of abode of the printer on first and last leaves of
a book, “The Handbook of Anarchy.” I was
the printer, and the only failure to complete
technical requirements, as per Act of Geo. IY., lay
in not having my place of abode on the front as
well as the back. I stated myself in court as the
printer.
2. The Act is obsolete, inasmuch as the pub-
lication known as Moore’s Almanac was
brought under the notice of the authorities, some
years ago, in Bear’s case, in support of the con-
tention that the Act was obsolete. It was decided
that the Act was in force, nevertheless this pub-
lication was not subsequently interfered with on
account of deficient imprint, and now appears
with no imprint at all, though it is under State
patronage. Also, most of the publications of the
N.S.W. Govt. Printer since then fail to comply
with the requirements of the Act; thus fixing
definitely that the Act ceased to be valid imme-
diately after Bear’s case. It is not in the preroga-
tive of the Government to make laws and break
them. This being a merely civil no indict-
ment could lie against the heads ot a Government
for causing or suffering it to be >-olat.-d in the
name of the State ; and their doing so amounts to
a release by the State (which “can do no wrong,”
even if it tries) of the obligation, by acknowledg-
ment of obsoleteness.
3. The pamphlet was not stitched or wired, bub
pasted, so that the different leaves could not be
separated without destroying the substance of the
paper, thus constituting it a single sheet, and,
therefore, under the Act, even if the latter were
still valid, exempt from the obligation of having
two imprints.
4. There was a substantial compliance with the
Act, as the preamble states clearly that it is
directed against anonymous publications—” the
evils arising from the printing of books by persons
unknown.” Here the name of the author, printer
and publisher was set forth three times, and not
merely on a cover or fly-leaf, but in the body of
the work, so as to be quite inseparable without
destroying the reading matter.
Secondly, as to the proceedings in court. —5. I
had come forward, thinking I was called as a
witness, to assume the responsibility in the case
of Robinson, who was before the court, when he
was sent back, and I was asked to plead to the
charge. My intention had been not to appear to
the summons, considering that the Act being obso-
lete nooffence was disclosed. I was about to explain,
when the magistrate, who, I am informed, was Mr.
Whittingdale Johnson, called to me, “Now, then,
plead guilty or not guilty; we don’t want any
anarchist speech here !” I said ;“I am not going
to make an ‘ anarchist speech ’ at the present junc-
ture, but to take a preliminary technical objec-
tion— ” He interrupted me, calling out several
times, “You have no right to publish sedition;
you must expect to be punished for publishing
sedition; you publish sedition and you will be
punished for it.” I said, “You had better read
the book before talking about it; and I am not
charged with publishing sedition, but with a
purely technical breach of an old Act of George
IV., which is ignored by Government publica-
tions, clearly showing, in my opinion, that this
part of it at least is obsolete.” He interrupted me
again, ordering me to plead guilty or not guilty. I
continued: “Therefore, I claim that the sum-
mons discloses no offence, and—” but before I
could explain how I came to seem to have
“appeared,” he interrupted : “I decide that point
against you at once.” From this out I could not
get a dozen words in edgeways for his cries of
“You will be punished for publishing sedition,”
“You have no right to publish sedition,” &c.,
till he varied the performance by saying, “ Fined
.£20.”
6. I applied to have a case reserved for the
Supreme Court upon points that I wished to set
forth, whereupon he said, “ I won’t take any notice
of you ; you have no right to publish sedition.”
7. I then said, “I give notice of appeal to the
Supreme Court, to which end I apply for a stay
of proceedings to enable that appeal to be prose-
cuted.” He said, “ I won’t take any notice of
you ; you must consult your legal representative.”
I said, “You can see that I have no legal repre-
sentative; I am conducting my own case.” He
said, “I can’t help that; you have no right to
publish sedition.”
8. W. H. K. Robinson and Charles Wolfe were
in turn brought forward, talked at by the magis-
trate and fined without any evidence being given
against them, and practically without the oppor-
tunity of calling evidence in defence.
9. The magistrate then, turning again to me,
exclaimed, “It’s a very difficult case; a very
difficult case ! But you have no right to publish
sedition 1”
10. Once imprisoned I had no facilities for an
appeal without legal assistance, which I was not
in a position to obtain, nor could I appeal at all,
not having already instructed a solicitor to that
effect, without applying to the governor of the
gaol for permission to apply to the Comptroller-
General of Prisons for permission to apply to the
Minister for Justice for permission to appeal to
the Supreme Court. This rigmarole was too much
for me, and I declined to avail myself of the
Governor’s permission to ask for permission to ask
for permission to appeal pursuant to notice,
especially seeing that it would have been a matter
of impossibility to get in the appeal in time under
such conditions.
11. Thus, as it appears to me, without even a
valid legal pretext for a prosecution, I and my
companions were sent to prison with the mere
form of trial and practically forbidden to appeal
to a more competent tribunal.
12. The sentence once served, no appeal or
motion to quash will lie, yet, by reason of the
alleged conviction as legitimising the imprison-
ment, we are debarred for life from our civil right
of visiting any of our friends who are or who may
be imprisoned—according, at least, to the gaol
regulations.
13. Is not such persecution the surest way to
breed Anarchy ?

SATURDAY, NOVEMBER 3, 1894.
Mary Brownlow and Her Judge.
The Bulletin has received this letter :
Editor Bulletin,—ln your issue for Oct. 20 appears a
cruel and malt volent paragraph relating to the late Sir
Alfred Stephen, which will give him no pain, but it has
been a cause of much indignant distress to those who
loved him, and this includes everyone who had the honor
cf his friendship. The writer endeavors to make his
point by reference to the case of Mary Anne Brownlow,
who murdered her husband on April 10, 1855. The para-
graph says: “The wound was not serious, but the man was
unhealthy and he died. The offence was unpremeditated ;
the woman was deranged by pregnancy and maddened
with insults. The Judge awarded the capital sentence,
and set his face like a stone. Mary Brownlow lingered
in gaol, with hanging in prospect, till her infant was
born.” The report of the trial in the S.M. Herald
of Sept. 14, 1855, gives quite a different account, and
shows that the crime was premeditated, for she walked
out of the house to her husband with a-concealed knife ;
that on his saving, “ Mary Anne, you have a knife to
stab me ” she denied it, but, after some minutes, sud-
denly slabbed him. On being arrested, she said “ she
had done it, and that she had promised it to him a long
lime before.” Dr. Andrew Morton, who saw the man
after lie was wounded, said that he “ saw the wound was
necessarily faial.” The woman was not pregnant, foi
Eli/.a Hiblott slated in tier evidence that she was a ser-
vant in the prisoner’s employ, and was holding “ the
baby.” She did not, therefore, “linger in gaol with
hanging in prospect till her infant was born, for she was
convicted on Sept. 11th, and executed on Oct. 11th fol-
10The"report says: “His Honor summed up with great
care and attention, reading over nearly all the evidence
from his notes, and clearly explaining to the jury the
legal distinction between murder and manslaughter.
On delivering the verdict, in answer to a question put by
his Honor, the foreman of the jury said: “We are of
opinion t hat no evidence has been laid before us to
justify us in finding that any blows were struck during
the altercation between the prisoner and the deceased,
and we are farther of opinion that when the prisoner
stabbed her husband she intended to take his life. The
pris ner was defended by the late Mr. Peter Faucktt,
who it is true, raised the point that the killing was done
under the influence of jealousy, hut the deceased in his
thing deposition said that “ on the evening on which he
was scabbed he had had an altercation with his wife about
a lease which he refused to give to some person, that he
believed she stabbed him from jealousy, but that there
was never any ground for such feelings.”
From the foregoing particulars I have but little doubt
that yourself and your readers will realise how unjust are
the strictures passed in your paragraph. It more were
wanted to prove that, as a Judge, Sir Alfred Stephen
was as merciful as he felt to be consonant with his public
duty, it may be found in the fact that at the same sittings
of the Circuit Court another woman, CATHERINE Reid,
was also tried for murder ; she having in a quarrel stabbed
a man in almost the same part of the body. The report
of the trial says his Honor summed up, and the jury
returned a verdict of manslaughter.—l am, &0., Jno. M.
Creed. Legislative Council, Sydney, Oct. 23, 1894.
Before commenting on this apology, there are
certain things which it is desirable to say. The
paragraph which Dr. Creed complains of was
neither cruel nor malevolent: it was simply
just. In its position as public commentator,
The Bulletin is, within the limits of human
fallibility, quite as impartial as was the deceased
judge whom Dr. Creed extols. That its com-
ments should occasionally “ cause much indig-
nant distress ” is to be expected. Plain speak-
ing is not so common in Australia that the voice
of Truth can fail to jar in the chorus of syco-
phancy which greets the obsequies of our little-
great-men. Yet The Bulletin is of opinion
that the climate of this country is quite warn!
enough for the lady to roam out now and again
without a muffler. Dr. Creed needn’t have any
medical alarms : Truth is mighty tough,
• * #
The Bulletin did not have “ the honor of
Judge Stephen’s friendship,” or it might also
have loved him. Friendship makes a lot of
difference. This paper is aware of a number
of highly interesting usurers —financial thumb-
screws, Shylocks raised to the nth power of
squeeze, veritable vampires of percentage —who
are the best fellows in the world en famille.
Their hospitality embraces the four winds of
Heaven —they are never so happy as when you
are eating roast-debtors’ flesh and drinking
stewed-debtors’ juice in their splendid dining-
rooms, ablaze with tapers fed by the fat of the
Gentile, hung with magnificent curtains dyed
in Gentile blood. Nevertheless, when Truth
walks into these jolly dogs’ strong-rooms and
views them in their public capacity, she fre-
quently makes some very nasty remarks-
remarks which “cause much indignant dis-
tress ” in the Mosaic social circle. The
Bulletin only deals with Judge Stephen in
his public capacity; it knows nothing of him
in any other. It is therefore able to dissociate
him entirely from his private surroundings, and
view him solely as a public figure—lawyer,
judge, jurist, lieutenant-governor, and what
not. If Dr. Greed suffers distress as a private
friend because The Bulletin points out J udge
Stephen’s public deficiencies, that is Dr.
Creed’s misfortune, but it is not The Bul-
letin’s fault.
» * *
In the little wreath which this paper laid on
Judge Stephen’s coffin it was careful to point
out that he was a just Judge according to his
lights. It added, in effect, that his lights
rather made the judicial fog thicker. The case
of Mary Brownlow was cited, not because it
was exceptional, but because it was typical.
Judge Stephen was indeed no “ Bloody
Jeffreys.” Of the hundreds whom he hanged
during his half-century of power, there is not one,
so far as The Bulletin knows, who can say at
the Day of Judgment that he or she did not
have a fair trial according to the law. Nor is
there one who can say that from him or her
was not exacted the uttermost pound of flesh
which the law permitted. The letter of the
law was Judge Stephen’s fetish. The spirit of
it, the objects of its institution, the results of
its execution, moved him never a whit. Between
the upper and nether millstones of Law and
Judge the criminal was usually ground to
dust. If the law mentioned extenuating
circumstances, Judge Stephen extenuated ; if
it did not, he recognised no extenuations of
fact. His mind was singularly callous to
suffering. He imprisoned, flogged, and hanged
with the passionless activity of a machine.
Every case was to him a theorem in mathe-
matics : given certain evidence, and the con-
clusion inevitably followed. His highest con-
ception of the law was as an avenging Nemesis,
exacting an eye for an eye, a tooth for a tooth,
a life for a life ; a Fury following close on the
heels of the evil-doer and scourging and
choking him out of existence. That is a bar-
baric, a degraded, dangerous conception ;
and, in spite of Dr. Creed, the Judge who has
no other is a curse to the community in which
•he lives.
* * *
Judge Stephen was a product of the Aus-
tralian Dark Ages. He was familiar from his
vouth up with the music of the triangles, the
clank of the hammers on a scaffold; and
he breathed continually the reek of human
blood. In the early part of this century, Aus-
tralia was a shambles where civil and military
butchers struck down convicts like bullocks,
not because they had offended, but because con-
victs, like bullocks, were made to be struck down.
Judge Stephen waded through slaughter
to his judgeship and when he reached
it the instinct of slaughter was engrained
in him. Death sat on the Bench at his right
hand, and Torture at his left. He held the
belief that law is established to punish crime ;
he knew nothing of the modern doctrine that
law is established to prevent crime. Penologists
nowadays are aware that, scientifically speak-
ing, there is no such thing as criminal respon-
sibility. The criminal is an effect of causes
quite beyond his control, and is no more to be
blamed for his actions than is a wild beast.
Society can only prevent his commission of
further offences, or so deal with him as to
deter others from committing offences. But
Judge Stephen, reared in the spirit of the
brutal Jewish code, was to the last in-
capable of receiving this view. His justice
was revenge. He shed blood like water, and
never knew that blood begets blood, that the
precious drops he spilt were like dragons teeth,
springing up armed men to reap a new harvest
of outrage and murder. When Mary Brown-
low stabbed her husband stabbing cases were
epidemic. One ghastly crime after another, in
different localities of the province, the news-
papers reported. Men stabbed women, women
stabbed men, men and women stabbed each
other. Judge Stephen hanged all the homi-
cides, or as many as he could catch, with the
same solemnity and unction. Fresh homicides
arose, breathing defiance of him. He hanged
again, and yet again ; he kept on hanging ; and
did natural conditions not set a bound to the
most consistent hangman’s capacity he would
be hanging still. But the homicide has out-
lived him ; and now, over his grave, casts down
a gauntlet which will never be taken up.
# * *
The impotence of the black cap never seemed
to strike Judge Stephen. On the contrary, a
triumph of his life was when he succeeded in
extending its sphere of usefulness. The old
English definition of murder, fixed by Coke
and cited by Blackstone, pre-supposed “malice
aforethought, express or implied.” Judge
Stephen was never happy in the thought that,
before he could hang a man, some intention of
taking life had to be proved. So far back as
1855 (S.M. Herald, April 19) he is reported as
saying:—■
I must put on record my repudiation of the very dan-
gerous idea that the mere absence ot a } reconceived
design to take life (where the circumstances show a
deliberate act with a deadly weapon, calculated at the
least to endanger life) can make the act of taking life less
than murder.
So, all through his career, Judge Stephen
fretted under this definition ; and when, at the
passage in 1883 of the N.S.W. Criminal Law
Amendment Act of which he was the chief
author, he succeeded expunging the obnoxi-
ous phrase, it gave hifii a new lease of life. To
him, dulce et decorum erat pro patria suspendere.
* * *
Of this Act the Parliament which passed it,
after 11 years’ hesitation, must take the respon-
sibility ; but Judge Stephen claimed and
deserved the credit of invention. Its bar-
barity exceeds belief. One passes, in reading
it, into a 12th-century dungeon, with its
victims stretched on the remorseless rack, its
executioner heating irons in the brazier, and its
atmosphere heavy with the smell of singeing
flesh. The branding-irons, indeed, were for-
bidden to Judge Stephen ; but he kills and flogs
relentlessly. He enumerates in 17 separate
sections offences punishable with the lash ; and
the scope of those sections is so wide, the
detail of offences is varied with such diabolical
ingenuity, that, were the law enforced, hardly
a body in the community could escape a
bloody back. To take but one example, Sec. 446
catalogues a listof offences—asspecified, entirely
new to the law, and first discovered by Judge
Stephen —for which any male person from ten
years of aye upwards may be flogged at the dis-
cretion of any two justices of the peace. This
section provides for a boy or man who may
write or mark upon any building, pavement,
wall, hoarding, fence, scaffolding, or any foot-
w'ay or roadway, in any public place, or in
view thereof, any disgusting word or form
or sign—Flogging. For a boy or man who
throws any missile, or throws, places, or
deposits any noxious or filthy matter or fluid,
so "as to endanger the safety of, or with intent
to injure or annoy any person, or so as to
create a nuisance —Flogging 1 For a boy or
man who, in any public place, park, or re-
serve, or cemetery, or any public or private
garden or ornamental grounds, wantonly de-
stroys or damages, or attempts to destroy or
damage, any road or pathway, tree, shrub, or
plant, trellis-stand, flower-stand, railing, seat,
fountain, or other structure— Flogging 1 For
a boy or man who wantonly destroys,
damages, or disfigures, or attempts to destroy,
damage, or disfigure any portion of a public
building, statue, work of art, or pedestal, or
structure belonging thereto, or any tombstone
or monument, in any cemetery or church-
yard Flogging ! Under this devilish code
the child who throws a stone at a bird
in a tree, who cuts initials on a seat, who
writes names on a building—who does any
mortal thing, in fact, that a thoughtless child
may do, can be haled before two justices,
flogged, and ruined for life. The Bulletin
makes no pretence at sorrow that the man
instrumental in so blotting the New South
Wales statute-book has lost the power to do
further mischief. Living or dead, it is best for
the individual and the community that a man
should get neither praise for the sake of praise,
nor blame for the sake of blame, but only
Truth for the sake of Truth. Judge Stephen
was a noose round the neck of Australia.
* • •
With Dr. Creed, as a friend of Judge
Stephen, these considerations may possibly
have little weight. To all others, The Bul-
letin believes they will furnish conclusive
justification of the paragraph of which he
complains. This paper judged the Judge, not
alone upon the merits of the case of Mary
Brownlow, but upon the facts of his whole
public career; and the “indignant distress”
of his friends is a trifle compared with the
distress which he has inflicted, in the perform-
ance of what he thought his duty, upon
thousands of obscure men and women whose
sufferings drew never a line from Hie papers.
And, had Dr. Creed studied more closely the
records of the case of Mary Brownlow, he
might have thought twice before resting a
defence of his friend upon it. For the Herald
that he quotes, impelled by motives which it
is impossible at this distance of time to dis-
cover, suppresses a most essential portion of the
evidence. Admeasurement of the guilt of the
unfortunate woman depends greatly upon her
condition at the time the blow was struck.
The Bulletin asserted that she was “deranged
by pregnancy,” which Dr. Creed denies. Here
is an extract from the Sydney Empire of Sept.
14, 1855, reporting the trial. Dr. Morton,
examined by Mr. Faucett, said :
The prisoner was pregnant at the time [April 10, 1855],
and has been delivered of a child during the last two or
three weeks ; there are instances of females becoming de-
ranged when pregnant; the deceased had fallen and
rolled over when escaping ; the fall might have contri-
buted to the injury or have aggravated it.
The woman, therefore, did linger in gaol, with
hanging in prospect, till her child was born ;
though the child was born before the trial, and
not subsequently. As to the judge “setting
his face like a stone,” the Empire’s report
states that he said, in summing-up, that the
case was “ one of the most foul and brutal
murders ever brought before him,” and “if
the arguments of counsel for the defence
were sound ” [that the crime was unpre-
meditated, and that the only evidence of
premeditation was the woman’s alleged state-
ment when arrested immediately afterwards,
“I promised it to him tor a long time”—a
remark which must be discounted by her
frenzied stale] then the “life of no man or
woman in the colony would be secured from
the violence of brutal rage.” The Judge pro-
ceeded to deny the necessity of proving pre-
meditation (his old fad), and appears to have
demanded a verdict of murder from the jury as
clearly as a Judge could demand it. The jury
found that the crime was premeditated. J n
spite of Mary Brown low’s subsequent denial
of this, it probably was, if premeditation be
conceived to mean the hasty resolution sum-
moned up in the fit of passion which preceded
consummation. When awarding sentence, the
Judge said he had no doubt the crime teas com-
mitted under very intense excitement, and it
appeared also that the exciting cause was jealousy
but the prisoner’s life was forfeited, and she
was not to delude herself with hopes which
could only prove fallacious. Thus he did not
think that the deed was coolly, deliberately
premeditated; and Mary Brownlow fell a
victim to his favorite legal theory that killing
was murder, whether premeditated or not. And
to the last, even when a petition for commuta-
tion of the sentence, signed by all the magis-
trates and clergy of Goulburn, and a large
number of others, was forwarded to the Execu-
tive, he hardened his heart against mercy,
» « *
Thus, even at that day, public opinion was
more humane than Judge Stephen. Does Dr,
Creed think that now, when knowledge is
widened, a woman in the state of Mary
Brownlow would be executed for her crime in
any civilised country ? Her husband denied
that there was cause for her jealousy, and no
one will ever tell the truth. But, as a
physician, Dr. Creed knows that when the
great trial of maternity approaches, a woman
needs all the sympathy, all the excuses, that
men can give. Would Dr. Creed, sitting in
Judge Stephen’s place, have uttered that
sentence, and insisted to the bitter end that it
should be carried out ? The Bulletin does
not believe it. The account of the execution,
which occupies nearly a column in the Empire
of Oct. 15, 1855, cannot, after forty years, be
read without a shudder :
EXECUTION OF MARY ANNE BROWNLOW.
(From the Empire's Own Correspondent.)
Goulburn, Oct. 11, 1855.
At 4 o’clock this (Thursday) afternoon, this unfor-
tunate young woman suffered the extreme penalty of the
law on the scaffold erected for the purpose within the
walls of the gaol. Her case has exoitf d great interest and
sorrow in the community, on account of the extenuating
circumstances in her favor—circumstances, at any rate,
calculated to engender feelings of the deepest sympathy
and pity. I allude to her youth, she being only 23 years
of age ; to the fact of her having struck only one blow,
and that, without a doubt, while in a state of frenzy ; to
the fact of her leaving three orphan infants, the youngest
of whom is a baby not three months old, and who was
born in the gaol ; and to the fact of her previous un-
blemished reputation, excepting (as it is alleged) being
addicted to drink, and the particularly quiet, and sub-
missive, and pious behaviour which characterised her con-
duct in gaol. A numerously-signed memorial had been
sent to the Executive, praying that her life might be
spared
She has, up to the last moments, earnestly asserted
that she had no design whatever to kill her husband, to
whom she was devotedly attached. She had fallen away
considerably during her incarceration, for although every
possible attention was paid to her, yet her appetite failed
more and more, and she could take but very little nourish-:
ment ; and when brought on to the fatal drop her
extremely delicate appearance deeply affected everyone
present, and caused the tears to start irresistibly from the
eyes of the hardiest
The Goulburn people are very much discontented with
the result of their p' tition in behalf of Mrs. Brownlow.
A man named Patrick Maher was convicted on the
clearest possible evidence, at the same assizes, cf Aurdet:
ing his wife in the most brutal manner imaginable. His
wife received more than one stab from him, as she was
getting into her house by the window. She was found
with her body on a table and her feet out of the window,
the room deluged with blood, a bloody knife, and her
monstrous assassin lying beside a pool of blood,
drunk and asleep. But he is saved from execution by a
petty quibble of law. He is saved merely because the
Judge committed a trifling act of irregularity in suffering
his associate to refresh the memory of an unwilling
witness by reading his police-court ’depositions over to
him in a private room instead of in open court. . . .
The offices of the Goulburn Hbralij and almost all the
shops in town were closed. . . .
Mr. Roberts, of the Goulburn Hotel and mail-con-
tractor, had despatched orders down the Sydney road
urging the mail-drivers to arrive in town, at all lisks,
before four o’clock ; and so anxious were the coachmen to
do anything which might give the slightest possible ray
of hope for rescuing the poor woman from death, that
they actually drove up to the Goulburn Post-office before
half-past two o’clock. But all was in vain; no reprieve
came; and shortly prior to four o’clock the deputy-
sheriff arrived at the gaol and claimed the body of the
prisoner. The executioner was led to her cell, where she
was engaged in earnest prayer with the Rev. Mr. Sowbrby.
Having pinioned her, she was escorted to the foot of the
platform.
Her interesting countenance and her severe debility
struck all the beholders with deep emotions of pity. Her
once fine frame was greatly attenuated ; she had to be
assisted up the ladder, not from any want of fortitude or
resignation, but from sheer enfeeblement of body
The rope was adjusted, the cap drawn over her face, the
executioner withdrew the bolt, and falling through the
trap-door she was immediately dead without a single
struggle or convulsive movement. Every spectator was
deeply affected ; and stout, brave men, who would laugh
at a cannonade, could not with all their efforts control
their emotions at the sad, sad sight.
And—The Bulletin repeats the Lord
have mercy on Alfred Stephen’s soul !
PLAIN ENGLISH.
The N.S.W. Sugar Problem.
Premier Reid’s strictly Freetrade attitude m
the matter of the N.S. Wales sugar-duty is in-
teresting as showing what an unconsciously
humorous thing a Freetrade attitude may he.
The sugar-duty, as he remarked to a deputa-
tion the other day, was one of those revenue-
duties which have gradually become protective
in their incidence. Premier Reid objects to
protective imposts, so it is part of his pro-
gramme to abolish the sugar-tax ; he does not
object, however, to purely revenue imposts, so
he does not propose to abolish the sugar-tax
until it becomes protective. When the sugar-
tax was a purely revenue duty on an article
that was almost wholly imported, it necessarily
raised the price of the commodity. Neither
Mr. Reid nor any other member of the Free-
trade party objected to the price being
raised to the miserable consumer so long
as no local industry was benefited, and
no one received any employment or any
wages through the tax, and it did not cause
anything to be added to the aggregate wealth
of the community, or did not make it in any
way independent of outside sources of supply-
But by-aud-bye something went wrong, for a
big sugar industry grew up, which furnished


employ ment to a g° o( i many thousands o
people, and distributed a good many hundreds
of thousands of pounds annually in wages. The
ne w industry made practically no difference in
the revenue, for, though it grew steadily, it
barely kept pace with the growth of population ;
therefore, New South Wales imports as much
sugar and the Treasury collects as much in
duties now as it did a good many years ago.
Adso, the internal competition forced down
prices to a remarkable extent —no less than
three separate reductions have been made in
the wholesale price of the local article this
season alone. Nevertheless, Premier Reid, who
made no objection to the raising of prices to
the consumer when prices were much higher
than they are at present, now wails bitterly
about the enhanced cost of one of the neces-
saries of life just when the cost is not
enhanced to any serious extent, and —in
the alleged interests of that same consumer
whom he cared nothing about in the days of his
real troubles under the “ Freetrade ” regime—
he proposes to practically destroy a huge in-
dustry and turn its employes adrift. Com-
paring the present time with the days of eight
or nine years ugo, when Premier Reid and his
party cheerfully acquiesced in the impost which
they now object to, the State has lost nothing,
for it gets as much income from this particular
source as before, and the people at large have
gained much, for prices have fallen heavily.
Therefore, the only visible reason for the recent
change of front is that Freetrade is so essentially
the doctrine of imports, in contra-distinction to
local manufactures, that the mere sight of a
local manufacture has come to be regarded as
proof that something is seriously wrong. The
unconscious motto of the Foreign-trade party
is “ Any person found starting a new industry
oil these premises will be prosecuted.” Trea-
surer M‘ M tlx.an demonstrated this some years
ago, when he solemnly informed a deputation
of persons connected with the tobacco industry
that the reason for certain tariff alterations
was that manufacturers had begun to use too
much of the local product, and too little of the
imported leaf—in other words, the miserable
local producer had to be discouraged on sound
Freetrade principles. The Sydney Telegraph,
about the saxne time, in a moment of gruesome
candor, enunciated the same great principle
in its commercial columns when it expressed
the opinion that the abolition of the Jennings-
Dibbs Government’s candle-duty would check
local supplies, and thereby make prices firmer
—in other words, the Telegraph’s commercial
editor cheerfully anticipated that, by the
application of Freetrade principles, the local
candle-maker would be thrown out of work,
and the cost of candles to the consumer would
l>e increased at one and the same time. And
now, Premier Reid, with his new-born sym-
pathy for the down-trodden sugar-consumer,
just when prices are falling to the lowest point
on record and the protected local industry is
booxhing, is one more example of the same great
principle : “ Any person found starting a new
industry on these premises will be prosecuted.”
The situation is so wildly grotesque that even
the fact that it was the Freetrade party which
imposed the abhorred sugar-duty, and thereby
created the local sugar industry, can’t make it
any more ludicrous than it already is.
Fourteen Hours per Diem.
The now hard-pressed Sydney Tramway and
Omnibus Co. is considering ways and means
whereby it may grind its next dividend out of the
bones of its employes. The bus-driver in the
co. ’s service is already ground down to such an
extent that it is a matter of some ingenuity to
find out how he may be ground further, but
the operation is, at all events, to be attempted.
At present he works 14 hours a day, for six days
in the week, plodding in rain and shine behind
his two horses along the dreary, endless city
streets, giving change, selling tickets, keeping
Ids eye always abroad for the breathless fat
lady with the bundles, who is waiting to board
his vehicle at the corner, and who will report
him if he doesn’t see her, and watching for the
bad coins which everyone tries to pass on him
after dark. His Sundays, like his week-days,
are mostly spent on the box, taking good
Christiaxxs to church; and public holidays only
differ with him from other days because his
load is heavier, and his two steeds are more
exhausted than usual, and it is harder to get
them along in schedule time, and the bad coins
are ~i >re numerous than is customary. He gets
from 365. to £2 weekly for this dull, incessant
grind, and the only redeeming feature in his
existence is a holiday once a week, when his
place is taken by a “ relief” driver. Now the
co., for purposes of economy, proposes to
abolish the relief drivers, and when this is done
the omnibus-man will sit on his box for 14 hours
a day during about 365 days in the year, and
will only drop off his high seat when he drops
into the grave. There are not enough of him
to make his vote a matter of consequence to
anybody, so the legislators who strive so hard
to legally enforce the eight-hour system for the
collier—who toils under the piece-work system
and has mostly got the eight-hour system
already—take no special notice of him. And,
as unemployed drivers are sufficiently plentiful,
it is almost certain that, after a little feeble
resistance, the company will carry its point.
There is no power that The Bulletin knows
of to prevent it carrying its point. But
when it does, if the people of Sydney
care a single straw for the eight - hour
system about which so much eloquence is
expended, or for anything even distantly
resembling it, they will so deal with the Omni-
bus Co. as to break it up for good and all. The
fact that the omnibuses, even under the present
system, have been so largely supported, says
very little for the capacity of the citizens in
general to sympathise with the wrongs of any-
body outside their own little circle. The low
wages and the average 12 hours per diem are
the principal reasons why the bixses compete
so successfully with the State-owned tram ways,
where the eight-hour system prevails ; and the
difference in the hours of labour is a sufficient
reason why everybody should patronise the
State vehicles for preference, even at the cost
of some personal inconvenience. The reason
will be accentuated if—as is threatened—the
12 hours average is increased to 14. And even
the individual who doesn’t care how many
hours his fellow man works may presently begin
to appreciate the danger of driving in the
dark behind a weary, half-awake spectre who
stumbles along in a dream as his two-days’
work-for-one-day’s-pay draws to a close. The
reason assigned for the proposed change is the
necessity for hard economy to supplement a
falling revenue; but, if the Tramway and
Omnibus Co. can only exist by working its
employes 14—or even 12—hours a day, ic has
no right to exist at all, and no fall in revenue
can be large enough to justify this nigger-
driving corporation in making the hard lot of
its employes harder than it already is.
Undesirable Immigrants.
It has long been suspected that Premier
Seddon hasn’t brains enough to maintain the
policy of his brilliant predecessor. Ballance
was an advanced Democrat with original ideas
and the courage to carry them out. Seddon
tries to be another Ballance, but his idea of a
Democratic policy consists of lashing out pro-
miscuously at everything. As a statesman he
is a failure ; as the hind extremity of a mule he
would be a great success. At first he got on
reasonably well while merely completing the
schemes which Ballance had elaborated before
his death, but when new conditions arose and
he had to face them himself, the fierce, clumsy,
aggressive idiocy of the man and of his col-
leagues became apparent. It is especially
apparent in a recent measure termed the
“ Undesirable Immigrants Exclusion Act,”
about the most comprehensive and elabor-
ately muddled, thing of its kind upon
record. Under the provisions of this bill
no person suffering from tuberculosis or
leprosy shall be allowed to land in Maoriland.
The bill further limits the number of Chinese
and other Asiatics to be imported to one for
every 100 tons of the ship’s register, and raises
the poll-tax to <£so per head, but, as the
Asiatic who is already a British subject is
exempted, the advantage to be gained by this
proviso is very small. The Asiatic wants to be
excluded, not because he isn’t a British sub-
ject, but because he is an Asiatic, and if he
were forty times a British subject it would not
make him a whit more desirable. Then the
bill goes on to exclude every workman im-
ported under contract, every idiot, drunkard,
every person convicted of any offence punish-
able under Maoriland law with not less than
12 months’ gaol, every pauper (a pauper is
defined as a single person who has less than
.£2O in cash, or a married person who has
less than <£3o and £lO additional for each
child); every cripple (a cripple being a person
who is incapacitated from earning a livelihood);
and every person who seems likely, for any
cause whatever, to become, in the opinion of
the Immigration officer, a charge upon the
public funds. Therefore, a perfectly healthy
British cripple of irreproachable character, who
brought with him £lOO,OOO in cash and pro-
posed to settle in the province, is liable to
exclusion under the same Act which lacks the
moral courage to shut out the British Pathan
and the Bengali. As to the drunkard, he is
difficult to recognise, and even the Act doesn’t
profess to know what a drunkard really is.
The hard and fast rule that no person with less
than £2O in cash shall be admitted is a glaring
attempt to define the undefinable. Many a
person with less than £5 in his possession is a
desirable immigrant, and many an individual
with £lOOO is not, and, as a general rule, it is
safe to admit any healthy white man, able to
read and write, and with no criminal convictions
against him, and chance the rest. It is im-
possible to tell a desirable immigrant by
the possession of £2O, or any other
sum in cash. After this the Act goes
into still wilder flights. Any tourist who stays
in the country longer than six months without
written permission from a magistrate shall
become a prohibited person, and be liable, as
such, to be fired out. Any immigrant who
becomes destitute, and applies for work or other
assistance to any charitable institution within
12 months after his arrival, must be taken back
whence he came at the cost of the ship which
brought him. Any Maorilander who has been
away from his country more than three years
is to be fired out just like a foreigner if he
comes back crippled or without the needful
£2O, or otherwise contrary to the Act. The
Act fairly bristles with £5O penalties, and is so
far-reaching that, under it, an ordinary J.P.
may refuse admission to almost anybody at his
own thick-headed discretion. And yet it fails
to shut out the British nigger; and after wading
through multitudes of forms and ceremonies
and regulations, it arrives at the imbecile con-
clusion that the Governor may suspend any
portion of the Act at his discretion, and admit
the leper and the lunatic and the drunkard and
the pauper just as he feels inclined.
The Minimum Wage and the Maximum
Tory.
Says the Australian Mining Standard
The demand for a minimum wage has taken a great
hold of the Vic. working-man. That woeful person has
been tilting (for over a generation) at economic laws,
with the usual sangfroid of a Quixote, the result being
that his country is to-day on the verge of a catastrophe.
This new will-o’-the-wisp, when caught, is to redeem the
broken vows of Protection, and convert Victoria into the
long-promised paradise. Already, to their disgrace,
several municipalities have yielded to senseless clamor,
and have forced on contractors stipulations that not less
than a certain fixed wage shall be paid to their men. Of
necessity such contracts must break down. Human
nature fights against them. Whenever an unscrupulous
contractor and a needy workman meet, there and then
such contracts become waste paper.
This is typical Tory argument. It is cynically
outspoken. Wages are not to be based on
reason, but on the bargain of an unscrupulous
contractor and a needy workman. Appalled by
starvation, the workman takes semi-starvation,
and economic laws are satisfied, if the workman
isn’t. This is good enough for China and for
the Tories, but the workman has awakened to
the fact that nothing is true till it has been dis-
proved by political economists. The minimum
wage is the protest against the noblest product
of economic science—namely, sweating. The
markets of the avorld are controlled by con-
spiracy, prejudice, lies, and cruelty, and the
result of all this is a Price—a quotation for the
financial nress —and this ultimatum of selfish-
ness is not sordid like its source, but divine.
A man’s labour is up for sale —the labour is
wealth-producing, but the man can be starved.
Let us combine against that man to pay him
less than his fair share of the wealth he can
produce. Let his hunger tell upon him ; let
the hunger of his wife and children tell upon
him—and he is ours ! This is not conspiracy
it is Economic Science? Brotherly love?—bah !
Dibbs damned Chicago—let us damn Philadel-
phia ! Patriotism ? Patriotism is selfishness
multiplied by population —let us do our share
of selfishness !
Womanhood Suffrage.
Editor Bulletin, —The modern woman is
abroad, and her cry fills all the earth. Some-
body has said that woman was born to suffer,
and that man was born to be suffered ; but the
sex which in most of the animal species is
classed as the weaker, and only in Man attempts
to pose as the stronger, is rapidly inverting
this aphorism. There is now a modern
woman’s party, which includes some young
creatures of the child-bearing sex, and many
old women of both sexes. The constitution of
this party is peculiar. The trousers-wearing
section comprises a small sprinkling of shrewd
young fellows with a political axe to grind, an
advanced woman to win, or an ancient one to
please ; many cranks and fad-mongers whose
special varieties of insanity are calculated to
appeal rather to the emotional natures of
women than to the intellects of men ; clergy-
men of all denominations and shades of belief—
for by none is the power of the church more
firmly upheld than by those whose daily
actions are alternately swayed by an ecstatic
yearning for the joys of Heaven, or a quivering
trepidation at the flames of Hell; a few golden
age visionaries of the Besant variety, and free-
thinkers of the Bradlaugh variety ; most
advocates of free love and free license; and a
certain proportion of cast-iron Conservatives
who cunningly guess that all democratic inno-
vation will be shunned by their feminine clients
with more emphatic opposition than by most
conservative men. And the alleged women who
support the movement, who are they ? In
the main, disappointed, childless creatures who
have missed their maternal vocation ; ill-
favored ones who will never get an opportunity
of exercising it; the bitter-hearted whose day
is past ; and then the cranks and the fad-
mongers ; the followers of the teetotal parsons ;
the females who fish for the souls of the
soiled in the back alleys of the slums with a
heartfelt conviction that they alone are the
light of the age, born into the world to reform
the abomination called man. They will prob-
ably succeed, they and their so-called male fol-
lowing, in achieving female suffrage, but logically
follows also female representation ; and behind
that, the dissolution of marriage and the institu-
tion of free love. “No taxation without repre-
sentation,” shout the female suffragists. Granted.
This, however, applies only to the self-support-
ing female. The married woman is supported,
in nine cases out of ten, by a legally respon-
sible husband. His political representation is
nullified by a vote-holding wife of adverse
political ideals, and doubled by a vote-hold-
ing wife of similar political ideals. He also
may take up the cry “No taxation without
representation !” when marriage and the family
will become merely a memory of the paleozoic
period.—Yours, An Unreformed Man.

Throughout Australasia the Tory “ second
chambers ” of the Legislatures are fermenting
towards their own doom. The elderly irre-
sponsibles of New South Wales are dancing
fandangoes upon popular liberties and pigeon-
holing the expressed principles of the people’s
elected representatives, until it needs but a
trivial breeze of agitation to fan into fury the
smouldering wrath of the masses. In Tasmania,
the Government has had to convene a special
session in order to devise measures to stomach-
pump the Legislative Council. In Maoriland,
the Upper House has so outrageously dis-
figured attempted popular legislation that the
Treasurer has appealed to Representatives to
defend their privileges, and a conference be-
tween the two Houses has to be resorted to as a
possible way out. The democratic Kingston
Government, of South Australia, nervously
anticipates from the Council the practical des-
struction of its latest reforms, although that body
has been regarded as more largely leavened with
democratic units than any other similar chamber
in the Australias. The Vic. House of Fat is
simply mountainous in inertia, though feeble
with past frights. In Banaualand the case is
the most hopeless of all. With a practically
bought-and-paid-for Assembly and a Kanakil-
grab dominant party, there is talk that a
high-property-suffrage chamber may be sub-
stituted for the paralysing present institution,
whose only redemption is that it could be
swamped if the democracy once captured the
people’s chamber ; and the danger there is that
this deadly wound will be inflicted, under the
guise of a popular reform, before the demo-
cratic majority of the province has time to
mobilise its representatives. Westralia is still
in the first fat choke of the plutocratic
garotters —in the honeymoon of its dishonour.
And, in England, the focal point of most of the
burning questions of reform is the abolition of
the hereditary House of Lords.
.
Justice Holroyd (Vic.) summing-up re George
Morrison, charged with wife-murder, said :
He regretted to some extent that there had not been
the testimony of medical men with regard to the state of
the prisoner’s mind, hut it certainly did not appear that
he had at any lime suffered from brain-disease, or affec-
tion of the mind.
Then the Judge gave the jury two options:
“ wilful murder” or “ not guilty, on theground
of insanity at the time of committing the
offence.” The jury refused both by disagree-
ing, though they showed a strong tendency,
by their questions, to a compromise verdict
of “manslaughter.” It would appear that
in allowing such a case to go to a jury on
such evidence, Justice Holroyd erred gravely.
A man’s life was at stake, but that life was
committed carelessly and recklessly to the
mercy of a jury which, so far as the judge
knew, might not have had a full sense of its
responsibility. The judge admitted that testi-
mony should have been called as to Morrison’s
sanity. He admitted that the crime was a
startling one in view of the man’s antecedents.
Then, instead of calling evidence himself to
clear away the doubts on the subject, he let
the case go to the jury and chance it. That
the jury disagreed, is good luck for Morrison.
Also for Mr. Justice Holroyd.

The Labor members of the Victorian Assembly
will find themselves assaulted at the earliest
possible opportunity with a sham patriotic pro-
posal to reduce their salaries to £2OO per
annum— i.e., £ 5O less than Premier Turner
will ask the House to agree to. This is just a
simple device for making political capital out
of the fact that certain Radical legislators are
not capitalists. They will be driven to vote
against the extra retrenchment, and, having so
voted, will be held up to public notice by the
Fat Man party as shocking examples of indiffer-
ence to their bleeding country’s distress. J. B.
Patterson and his Tory followers may lack
courage to speak openly against the principle
of payment of members, but some among the
“ right-thinking ” gang will probably enlarge
upon the selfishness of persons who really
need £5 a week to keep them going, and
the nobility of other persons who are willing to
relinquish that trifling amount because they
can get along nicely without it. The £2OO
proposal should be read by the light of a recent
Argus letter, which quoted £5OO a year as a
“ fair amount ” for rich gentlemen to pay for
the privilege of sitting in the House of Com-
mons. Everything considered, £3OO is a fair
all-round salary. More is too much ; less is
hardly enough. The proposal to pinch a few
unopulent members yet again in the cause of
Retrenchment is the usual device to put the
big man’s burden on the little man’s back, and
the names of its supporters can be trusted to
betray the character of their scheme.
St. Stead finds a worthy disciple in the comic
pietist who has been playing the Gospel fool to
large Sydney audiences. At one meeting this
pure-minded believer is reported to have told
his hearers :
You can’t stand and dance half through the night and
on into the early morning with more or less naked womm.
You can’t, you can’t stand it. Don’t be a fool. (Sensa-
tion).
It takes a first-class saint to properly enact the
part of the man with the muck-rake. The
diseased imagination of a dirty religionist will
smell out more uncleanness in a week than the
average man runs across in all his life. If this
kind of person can’t look at a woman in evening-
dress without boiling over with passion so much
the worse for this kind of person. And such
talk is to elevate the souls of the asses who
go and listen ! Christianity once dwelt in
“ temples not made with hands.” I'fow it
dwells in the gutter.
“ The police-magistrate complimented the
police on the manner in which the case was
worked up.” Thus daily paper reports of the
committal for trial of unionist shearers recently
for rioting, &c. Judges of the higher courts
do occasionally pay the police that compliment
after the accused have been convicted and sen-
tenced. Anyone who has resided in the
country knows that the P.M. is officially and
socially regarded as the “ voice ” of his district,
and that a large percentage of the jurors are
influenced by his expressions of opinion. The
juror who doesn’t appreciate the importance of
the local great man is generally challenged
by the Crown at the instigation of
the police. Therefore, when a P.M., in
making a committal, compliments the police,
it is tantamount to concurrence with the
prosecution in its theory that the accused are
guilty; and the magistrate who, from stupidity,
vanity, or bias, thus precludes men from
obtaining an absolutely fair trial by jury, is
unfitted for his position. Surely it is time
some democratic M.P. asked the Crown Law
office to define the duties of police-magistrates.
Are they to act as impartial judges only, or
are they encouraged, “by the non-interference
of their chief,” to pose also as handicappers in
the interest of the prosecution ?
Editor Bulletin,— Had under-manning any-
thing to do with the wreck of the Rodondo ?
Your readers may be astonished to learn that
only five or six sailors are generally carried
upon steamers of the Rodondo class, which
necessitates the look-out man relieving the
helmsman. Another practice in undermanned
boats is lashing the wheel in the 4 to 8 a.m.
watch whilst the helmsman and bridge officer
assist to wash decks. Of course, I do not say
that such were the practices on the Rodondo,
but that these things are done on board similar
coasting vessels. Also, for six months (and even
for two years) men have been employed in our
coasting steamers, and have never taken part
in the launching of a boat; nor have the boats
been lowered in that period. Hence the diffi-
culty in getting boats launched when a wreck
happens, and the awkwardness of the men—
who, in most instances, do not even know their
proper stations in danger. The duty usually
insisted upon by Marine Board authorities when
a large loss of life takes place—viz., boat and
fire-station practice by the crew—is never per-
formed, as there are not enough men carried
to launch and equip the boats efficiently. I
assert that undermanning is a source of grave
danger to nearly every coasting steamer which
leaves an Australian port, and if the public will
not protect themselves by definite legislation
they have no right to grumble that overworked
and underpaid men think of their own lives
before passengers’ when a calamity comes.—

rated Seamen’s Union of Australasia.

October 30, 1894.
Mv Dear Moorabinda—
Sydney Polo Club met at Kensington course
last Saturday, when an almost purely Potts Point
crowd patronised the rough-and-ready curriculum.
Gov. Duff was there with Lady Duff, in a non-
descript ficelle-colored garment, and attended by
a good handful of offspring. I was rather amused
at the altogether degage way in which the vice-
regal party behaved themselves —from Lady D.
downwards, all hung over the box-rail with folded
arms, d la the front row of a gallery of gods at
melodrama. It wasn’t exactly a bonnie day out
for the exiles from Fetteresso, ye ken. Mr. R.
W. Duff, in a tartan cap, never got a place, and
Mr. Pennyrnan’s boots didn’t glisten in the van
of any event I witnessed.
A needle-threading race, when a crowd of riders
had to dismount at full gallop, get a need Id
threaded by a damsel (one damsel apiece), and
bolt off again, was an amusing spectacle of hurry-
scurry and cool disregard of the “rules” that
would have turned a professional jockey green
with disgust. Miss Kate Duff, in dark blue,
threaded for Private-secretary Pennyman, but
]ollv-looking Miss Heather had the exciting job
of getting her brother’s needle under way. Sydney
belledom will doubtless score one against Duff
jun. for not going further afield for his needle-
rigger.
I didn’t care for the tandem race. Too many
leaders got face to face with their tormentors for
the tandem heats to convince an ardent sports-
woman, but there was no mistake about the way
the whips cracked. It was a regular whalebone
day. Pet gee-gees, which you intuitively knew
got hand-fed on lumps of sugar as a general thing,
must have been profoundly astonished at the
thumps they got. I thought the ponies had
rather a bad time of it altogether. They were
leathered out of all conscience on the track,
and when the card was over some of them got
harnessed into carts and things, and dragged their
masters home again.
The costume race wasn’t very comical. Most
of the Johnnies—including Mr. Duff—seemed to
have fallen back on their pyjamas in the absence
of inspiration ; one youth wore what looked like a
lady’s robe-de-nuit. Ido hope it belonged to no-
body more thrilling than his grandmother, anyway!
There was betting in the air as well as lively
music. A couple of enterprising cash-fielders, in
the Leger, shouted the odds about as loudly as
Danby used to call out “fire.” I think what
toned down the confident bellow of the ring was
the great shock to its pronunciation it kept on
receiving all day. A youth who backed Eurydice
had to go into elaborate explanations to let the
chastened money-merchant know he only meant
Yewridise —stress on the Yew —after all.
There seemed to be a good rush of dressing to
the grand-stand. Mrs. Hutton wore blue and
white and a pink rose in her hat; the acting
Governoress was all in black ; the Mayoress, in a
white gown with a black hat and feathers. “ The
handsomest woman in Sydney ” (according to
some of the men who are sole arbiters in these
matters) wore shades of brown with a romantic
hat. The lady is fat (so was Cleopatra, they say,
although Sara Bernhardt is a good enough ideal
Cleopatra for me), and when she laughs heartily
she doubles up as if green apples had something
to do with it; so I cannot say that I endorse the
verdict of more than half the clubs. Pretty Miss
Maud Roberts was there jn pale pink and a big
sort of bat. The thinness of a “ woolly ” heiress
was accentuated by a seanty muslin frock ; and a
pretty matron, who never misses a “ good ” race-
meeting, snd never forgets her little wagers
eilhe wore a frock striped in glittering gold—
allegorical of her good luck, I hope.
The spring rose-show of the N.S.W. Horticul-
tural Society, held in Sydney Town Hall so long
ago as Tuesday week, nevertheless lives freshly in
my memory as being one of the rosiest rose-shows
ever held by the society. The mere fact of that
everlasting exhibit of orchids and ferns getting
second place in the betting for the first time in
its life was a cheerful circumstance in connection
with the show. “ Variety is the spice,” &o.
Lady Duff, in a creamy-colored gown with tan
appointments, opened the festival with a melan-
choly smile after a president, or somebody one
pale-blue rosette ahead of the rest of the crowd,
had cleared his throat the regulation number of
times; but the speechifying was as short and frisky
as a rabbit’s tail. Now that “ saffron harness ”is
the latest snip for your gee-gee, I think women of
taste ought to give up trimming themselves with
tan. On single maidens especially it looks as if
they were anxious for a trial in double harness.
Two daughters, Miss Kate and Miss Isabel Duff,
in mournful shades of grey, accompanied Lady D.
to the r foot of the scaffold—platform, I mean—and
Private-sec. Pennyman did the rest. Touching
upon vice-regal doings, it may cheer the disap-
pointed exhibitress of the decorated table D. to
know that I heard, on good authority, Lady Duff
voted for its pretty pinky-saffron effects,, which
ran third in the balloting.
Miss Goodenough’s table got the most votes,
though it wasn’t paralysingly beautiful. Dark-
red carnations and lilies of the valley look fairly
well by daylight but would give a spotty effect at
night—besides which red and white aren’t aesthetic
tints for a dinner-table—they remind you too
much of raw meat. And when the guests began
to get bilious they’d imagine the lilies of the valley
sprinkled on the red flowers were little drops of
cold fat on the gravy. A table decorated in bright
yellow with ferns in little yellow-satin sacks
seemed an apropos sort of board to invite a Lon-
donderry shareholder to put his golden legs under
—but the table C, which took second prize, re-
minded me of fancy confectionery. The voting
for the table by ballot was a new departure—the
judges have had so many ugly moments with in-
furiated feminine table-fakirs that they have
instituted the ballot in self-defence. I am of
opinion that they should have it everywhere
where women do battle against each other.
Think, for instance, how fervently the horse-judge
would bless the man who introduced the ballot-
box into the equestrienne contests !
But this isn’t the rose-show —the roses scattered
all over the place, with their rich colorings,
sensuous scents, and occasionally ridiculous name-
tags. I saw one named “The tea-scented Miss
Marsden,” which was apropos, at any rate, for
the rose was just the yellowy color of the girl who
swigs unlimited tannin. Gardeners immortalise
more women than men in christening their nur-
series, by the way. I looked all over the show
for the “Whisky-scented Thomas Jones,” but no-
body had seen fit to keep his memory green. And
yet they say men have more privileges than
women!
An exhibit the women liked was a collection of
florally-adorned fans—the ugliest being like an
omelette in a frying-pan—leafless roses jammed
together on a palm-leaf fan. " The rose is certainly
a noble vegetable, but it wants a little coaxing,
like the rest of the garden, for ornamental pur-
poses. There was a table of pansies like fried
mushrooms in little paper collars —an artistically-
repressed exhibit of cabbagee and callot, flanked
by a little rush of pictures on a bamboo stand. I
will not go deeply into these works of alleged art.
They were like the Duchess of Plaza-Toro’s re-
marks—uncalled-for. A new feature of the show
was the gurgling music of a string band—rippling,
lilting music like what does duty in a play-house
for a “ waterfall in the distance ” —which livened
things up immensely.
Arthur Garner’s ’thusiastio ben. at Sydney
Lyceum last Wednesday was quite successful,
barring the grateful speech. There really is no
reason in the wide world why a benefit-taker
should ever thank an audience for being plastered
out in front of him, and take the rush of heads to
the stalls as a personal compliment—as so many of
’em seem to. It is never the object that attracts
the public—it’s the attractiveness of the pro-
gramme.' I am sure people ought to feel like
hypocrites when a pecuniary wreck rises in a long
frock coat behind the floats and tells them in
pathetic tones how good it was of them to roll up
for an afternoon’s amusement! Too much gush
cannot be poured over the good-natured artists
who assist, though some of them doit on the “ As-
you-are-so-I-might-be ” principle, of course. But
the “outside vulgar ” would go to a matinee held
for the purpose of buying a new oven for Sheol,
provided the bill was long and strong enough.
The Garner programme was neatly put. The
first act of “ Rosette,” with unassuming May Pol-
lard in the title-role. Miss Pollard didn’t fill the
pink chemise of Rosette so charmingly as Miss
Stewart can—but then it would be physically im-
possible for the latter lady to fill the tights of
Segur as Miss Pollard does. A nice thing about
Miss P.’s rendering of “Rosette” was that she
copied nobody, at all events. Brownlow sang
“Queen”of the Earth.” W. 8., in a “shop-
walker,” a white boutonniere, and with the words
in a’little hymn-book like Madame Social Purity
Sterling used to hug, didn’t look as -.brawnily
beautiful as he does with his grease-paint on and
lace round his knickers. Like a dressmaker’s
dummy, the more frills W. B. pats on the more
engaging he looks, but, stripped of all disguises,
he is a fine, upstanding youth, with a blonde, not
to say gingery footballers’ crjop, and a commend-
able habit of turning his toes out.
It may interest people to know that a certain
florist of Titipu has a deep grievance against the
Governor of his little village. His Ex. has re-
duced his weekly flower-bill from the oompara-
tively baronial sum of half-a-gui-nea to two-and-
six. The purveyor of green-stuff has no objection
to a proper economy, but when a Personage who
ought to break his neck to get the- first rose of
summer only orders whatever is florally equivalent
to a pennorth of “specked,” even the first gar-
dener himself would feel inclined to “chuck it,”
as the bad little boys say. And the most mys-
terious and aggravating part about it is that, in
spite of the reduction, his Ex.’s table is usually
ablaze with every blossom in season, though he
hasn’t worn a florist’s boutonniere for Titipu
doesn’t remember how long. A simple flower,
such as one might pick through a paling fence, has
been his sole coat-adornment, they say.
But the mystery of his table-decoration was
solved the other day. A leading Titiputian was
conversing on floral subjects with His Ex., and
expressed his intention Of buying a packet of
Somethingorother seeds to plant in his little front
garden. “But why buy them?” said his Excel-
lency, of Titipu, “you should beg them, as I do.
from the Botanical Gardens people. They will
always give ’em to you if you ask.” So that was
where the flowers cam frae !
I am told, on the authority of a lady
who saw the whole thing, that a toughened
Sydney spinster, lately promoted to matrimony,
hit on rather a novel idea to show off her wedding-
gown. But before proceeding to the storyette I
must say that I don’t wonder at her regarding the
blanched robes as a trophy, do you? They were
documentary evidence to her, so to say, that the
unexpected does sometimes happen.
She had a doll made—a three-feet miniature of
herself with her exact physical measurements
(though I suspect she knocked an inch or two off
the waist), and this she dressed up in a facsimile
of her wonderful wedding-dress, Valenciennes and
all. And then she solemnly stuck the monster up
in her brand-newMrawing-room and exhibited it
to her startled callers at her weekly “afternoons.”
But it might easily have been worse. I hear that
she was only prevented with the greatest difficulty
from “receiving,” got up herself in all the
elaborate white shroudings of her long maiden life.
Summer being here, .every woman who hates to
look hot and oily, and whom I am pre-supposing
to be cute enough to wear cellular undergear—
shapely corsets and all—simply must get a cellular
blouse in silk, wool, or cotton, the latest thing in
hygienic finery, and not expensive either. I saw
several at the Cellular Clothing Depot, in George-
street, opposite Hunter-street, and was very
pleased with both their cirr and their colours —
one in blue-and white stripes would look very
dashing on a really blonde woman. Lots of people
buy the cellular cloth'by the yard and make their
own garments, but the blouses at the depot would
tempt even an amateur dressmaker to give herself
a holiday. It’s very soothing to think that it is
possible to reconcile health and prettiness.
Yours affectionately,
SAPPHO SMITH.
Melbourne Confidences.
Melbourne, October 30.
Naval warriors have been worrying themselves
and anyone else within earshot ever since a mili-
tary lecturer cast an alleged slight upon their
branch of the service. If the “splendid seamen ”
had not taken such pains to divulge their
grievance none but themselves w>ould have known
anything about it, for most of the offending dis-
course was inaudible or otherwise incompre-
hensible to plain civilians. Considered as a
spectacle, though, the performance was amusing
to all. The modern Major-General, reading his
paper in the orthodox schoolboy-essay style,
looked as proud as a pouter-pigeon.
Somehow, ordinary attire seldom fits very
snugly over martial proportions. A uniform can
be pegged down tight'"and taut, but a starched
shirt-front ballooning above a conspicuously mili-
tary contour seems to point to the fact that even
manly chest can tee overdone.
Superfluity of padding, natural or otherwise,
recalls the Melb. wopian who affects artificial
hips, even when riding to the hunt. Once, when
the artful structure slipped right round and
added its charms to those of the opposite
direction, people went about saying that poor
Mrs. Z’s fine figure had seen its best days. They
innocently attributed her misplaced embonpoint
to natural causes, and thought old age must be
creeping o’er the base of her spinal column.
Two young doctors —one of Melb., the other of
an important mining centre—hare simultaneously
announced their engagements. More are ex-
pected to follow, for the profession is simply
booming in feminine popularity, and has been for
a week or two. Cupid owes a huge debt of grati-
tude to Surgeon O’Hara, I fancy.
The other week, Riverine sassiety received a
welcome thrill from a fashionable wedding, cele-
brated with exceptional pomp in the elated town
of Deniliquin. The pretty bride, who struck a
new note by introducing full-blown oranges among
the blossoms on her sacrificial robe, is the daughter
of a local medico and the sister of the pet prac-
titioner of a Melb. suburb. Her bridegroom’s
fame as a matrimonial prize cast a halo round his
head for several years, and it was not until certain
irrevocable words were pronounced that the divine
light flickered right out. By-the-way, this wear-
ing of real garden-produce has its disadvantages.
Don’t you remember the girl in “The Three
Clerks,” who affected natural grasses, vetch,
clover, &c., in her hair, because it looked so art-
less ? (5ne day, as she sat in a bower with the
hero of her heart, “ Mauass%r Jones,” a eow, ap-
proaching steadily from the rear/attempted to
browse off Juliet’43 horticultural decorations, and
was with difficulty dispelled. I must admit,
nevertheless, that I can’t see much analogy
between a fabulous cow and an ardent bridegroom.
If, perchance, the happy man desired one little
orange from the toilette of his loved one, I dare-
say he got it, and ate it ravenously. Not a bad
snbjeot for a sentimental nigger /melody—“ An
orange from my darling wifey’s skirt,” to the air
of “ A flower from my angel mother’s grave.”
Few of the original Mount Morganaires have
remained faithful to the land of their find. One
notable exception, however, has embellished the
local landscape by a gorgeous residence, which at
first he modestly designated “The Mansion,”
though later on he prefixed a Celtic word signify-
ing “The Great.” After all, the name is not mis-
leading, f®r the abode exactly fulfils one’s concep-
tion of a gold-king’s palace, and the imposing
entrance gates are said to be unequalled’ in Aus-
tralia.
On dit that, should Ihe division obtain Separa-
tion the canny owner hopes to get the edifice off
his hands at a profit, as the Govt. House of the
new province.
A ,p e n^ e e at of the Australian climate, Max
U Roll conjectures that "colonials” condemned
to purgatory must feel the atmosphere “down
below” somewhat chilly. This cheap joke is not
new among literary globe-trotters. In Anthony
irollope’s Australian experiences, published over
20 years ago, he says, apropos of Rockhampton,
that inhabitants of that town who by chance die
in sin suffer greatly from cold until they become
acclimatised, and constantly entreat to be allowed
to send back home for their blankets. Imagine,
therefore, the rage of Rockhampton patriarchs
at seeing this poor jokelet, their town’s exclusive
birthright, reconstructed by a glib Frenchman
into a Federal bon mot, applied impartially to
Australia at large. However, if Mona. 1 lionet
defrauded the Northerners of one story, be has
paid them back with anoi her—viz., the account of
his interview with Rockhampton Separationists.
Society’s Empress, somewhere up there,is a dame
of commanding bodily presence, who, on the
strength of unlimited funds and several trips to the
Continong, prides herself on always doing the right
thing. Some time back, at a ’ocal ball, it is said that
a cockroach ran from under the wainscot (as not (in-
frequently happens, I believe, even in the best
Bananaland circles) and into the middle of the
hall, where it posed as if meditating flight.. x
cockroach on the wing is about the most unpopular
insect extant. Its characteristic perfume and the
touch of its wiry legs combine to make men
abusive and women hysterical. Something had to
be_ done, and it was the aforesaid matron, the
principal guest of the evening, who did it. Slowly
she advanced upon the unsuspecting intruder and
with a rapid movement of her svelte foot crushed
him relentlessly to pulp. Now, a tropical cock-
roach is no gauzy insect, expiring without sound
or sign, but a muscular athlete, whose demise can-
not be accomplished without a good deal of
stromash. Asa dull squash fell upon the sickened
air and an attendant removed the mangled corpse
on a dust-pan, a shudder ran through the assem-
blage and the Lady High Executioner resumed
her seat with the air of one who has accomplished
a great deed and hasn’t got much thanks for her
heroism.
The daughters of this forceful mother are
equally'determined, and their wilfulness in lov.e-
anairs has more than once shattered domestic
peace. Pa leaves all such trifles to his wife,
knowing that any ineligible suitor, who counts
upon her as a mother-in-law, doesn’t hug his
delusion for long.
Once upon a time, a group of callers, seated in
the ornate drawing-room, were entertained by
what sounded like a paper-chase in the next apart-
ment. The younger and fleeter of the runners, so
far as could be judged by oral testimony, kept well
ahead with the bone of contention—a forbidden
letter, while Ma, stumbling and panting behind,
ejaculated, from time to time, “Don’t think it,
Miss! you'll never marry him!” “See if I
don’t!” was the rejoinder. And then the com-
pany in the next room would hear a bang on the
intervening furniture from the big stick of their
fashionable hostess.
I fancy that feminine characteristics are
changing, and if poets and novelists wish to be
up to date they must leave off ascribing to
our sex extreme magnanimity and forgetful-
ness of injury. According to Walter Scott, our
ancestresses, though not all they might have
been in piping times of prosperity, invariably
showed themselves in a more amiable light when
pain and sorrow wrung the brows of their male
contemporaries, were they friends or enemies. It
doesn’t seem so at present. I hear that a local
Abigail, whose “ boy ” is a retrenched railway-
porter, cherishes a long-standing grudge against
the ex-Minister of Railways. A week or so back
her mistress, disgusted with the bitterness and
vindictive party feeling displayed by more pre-
tentious sisters, went to this unspoilt child of
Nature and sought her opinion re the election,
hoping that here, at least, she would be refreshed
by some manifestation of traditional womanly
forgiveness. “Well, I’m jolly glad old Richard-
son’s kicked out, anyhow !” responded the damsel,
blithely, “ but don’t I just wish I could sit on
his chest, now he’s down!” And this obduracy,
mind you, is no isolated phenomenon. It can’t be
explained away by the theory that Abigail is, not
a fair specimen of her sex, because the girl is in-
tensely feminine in many ways, notably in her
veneration for the lords of creation. “Yes,
m’m,” she responded pensively, when questioned
regarding her family history, “ poor ma died 10
years ago, leaving a family of 7 girls and 5 gentle-
men !”
With Melb. carnival season began a dreary suc-
cession of callers at Gov. House, all intent upon
writing their names in the visitors’-book—-fearful
lest they should be left out in the cold, as at a
certain recent ball. The Hopetoun view of
etiquette is a stringent one. You are supposed to
call -immediately before any festivity, and take
your chance of an invite. Should you get it, you
call again; and, after the affair js over, still again.
Inferior mortals, who neglect this rule, are left to
oblivion; but those of importance, high officials and
such like, get hints that they have erred. "Quite
recently one of these received, wtth bis invitation,
a note to the effect that the Governor had ob-
served the length of time between the calls made
by this gentleman’s family. On another occasion
a lady was rash enough to express her opinion of
an indispensable official in anything but sotto-voce
fashion as she wrote her own and her relation’s
name in the book, quite too regardless of the
wooden-looking footman who stood by. A few
days later the champion of this iresome dame went
to write her own name, and, turning back a few
pages, found her friend’s and her friend’s relation’s
name struck out. Such careful study of these
ponderous tomes explains why the Govt. House
people have no time for other literature.
VAN M.


QUEEN VICTORIA'S OPINION ON
SMOKING.
Whether smoking is injurious or nob has been
often discussed. Ladies, who do not smoke them-
selves, generally opine that it is a nasty habit, it
la bad for the curtains and the lungs, it may pub
your bed. on fire, it makes one feel thirsty, &c.
Men, on the other side, believe in their Frossard’s
Cavour Cigars, and all these dangers aob on their
brave and persevering natures as so many stimu-
lants. Queen Victoria and the Earl of Rosebery
are both of the opinion that smoking is most
decidedly healthy for—the Treasury. The duty
on tobacco brought in over 10 million to the
English Government last year. It may be taken
for granted that Frossard’s Cavour contributed
largely towacda this sum.

“ Siberia,” revived at Sydney Majesty’* on
Saturday, is a Nihilist drama in six large, up-
standing acts. The scenes are mostly laid on
snow-clad plains and in deep, solemn, pine forests,
and the characters plunge around with huge, furry
overcoats on, and perspire considerably. There is
a pronounced Russian flavor about the oast, which
includes Neigoff, Jaracoff, Nordoff, Smailoff,
Partoff, Koskoff, and Khanoff, also Dorovitch,
Nordovitch, Ohristovitch, Petrovitoh, and Khato-
vitoh. Most of these people have little to do save
stand around and wear the above unpronounceable
terminations, and the balance spend most of their
time in flogging convicts and driving Nihilists
over great barren wastes on the endless road to
Tobolsk or Omsk, or Semipolatinsk, or some such
place. The first cause of the trouble is the sinful
conduct of Jaracoff, the Governor, who abducts
the best girls of Neigoff and Nordoff, and, to suit
his own wicked purposes, has the girl of the
former sent to Siberia for life. Whereupon
Neigoff disguises himself as Pulaski, and follows
in her footprints, and, after raising an insurrection
at the mines, the party escapes. During their
awful retreat across the snow Koskoff lives mostly
upon human flesh, and Stanislaus goes mad, and
the pilgrims are pursued and harried by Khanoff
as they drag themselves miserably through the
ice and frost. '

Some of the things in “Siberia” that want
to be explained a little are the impunity with
which Neigoff is allowed to harangue a revolu-
tionary mob in Moscow, and the success with
which he changes identities with Pulaski in full
view of the audience, seeing that he and Pulaski
are just about as like each other as Augustus
Glover is like Jennie Lee. Also, Neigoff
drags Governor Jaracoff about by the ears in
a manner which seems rather loose and reck-
less for a despotic Government to tolerate j
and when the haggard escapees meet on the
quay at Odessa they deliver long and eloquent
speeches to each other about liberty and similar
substances, while the minions of a brutal
and tyrannical Czar stand barely three yards
away and profess not to hear anything. This
deafness on the part of the minions is alto-
gether unaccountable. Further, the present
writer strongly objects to the funny man con-
tinuing to be funny all through the ghastly march
over the snow, and especially when be grabs the
bag of human flesh and retires behind a tree to eat
a portion ®f his frozen comrade. This comic ghoul
is moderately amusing at first, but he hangs
rather heavily on the drama after a while. The
piece is superbly staged, the view of Moscow, and
the frozen plain in act 173 or thereabouts, being
specially excellent; and Messrs. Rignold and Soot
Inglis bear the frost and burden of the day in an
eminently capable manner. Sterling Whyte,
Harry Hodson, and Lachlan M'Gowan are also
deserving of favorable mention, but the co. is dis-
mally “weak in the feminine element, and among
the ladies who go forth with their hair down to
suffer for their bleeding country there isn’t one
who 1 knows how to do it in a reasonably impressive
fashion. Otherwise, “Siberia” is a healthy,
spirit-stirring drama full of rousing appeals to
strike for freedom, and after sitting it out the
average auditor feels prepared to go out and burn
down a woolshed on the spot.

The opera season at Sydney Lyceum
indcd with a brief spell of “Mikado,” whose
object all sublime was well received. In fact,
there was a sudden boom in the oft-told Japanese
tale, which boom was hardly expected, seeing
chat the opera is now rather in the Indian summer
of its days. The'appearance of Wallace Brown-
low, as the third or fourth or 18th successive
Mikado, was in itself a solemn reminder of
this fact. There was nothing of any im-
portance left of the original Australian cast
save the fair Nellie Stewart and Howard
Vernon, but, while the rest were all more
or less new, Wallace Brownlow was even
oewer than most of them. He filled the part as
well as all save one of his predecessors, and, if he
was a trifle heavy in places, it was about the
only thing which could be alleged against his
otherwise unblemished character. Nellie Stewart’s
Vum-Yurn was as fresh and bright a little maid as
on her first appearance in the character, and the
rest of the Go., especially Tapley and the execu-
tioner, were all that could be asked for. “ The
New Boy,” with an entirely new company just
Arrived from England, was announced for Wednes-
day, too late for notice in this issue. All that is
Authentically known at time of writing is that
the “New Boy ” is said to be capable of giving
oven the “ Private Secretary ” five yards in 100,
and making a close finish of ife always provided
he isn’t nobbled and doesn’t run stiff. Anyhow,
he will be welcomed by a city
which has suffered from rather too much revival
of’late and will be glad to meet with something
fresh for a change.

Arthur Garner’s benefit at Sydney Lyceum
was an even more mixed programme than is usual
on such occasions. All the leading m'ummers in
Sydney, and a good many who are not leading,
managed to find standing-room on the bill, and
among them they produced a very satisfactory
effect. They also produced a new operetta,
“Penelope,” never before seen in Sydney, which
struck the audience as rather a happy little trifle,
with many tuneful spots scattered over it. In
the course of the proceedings Mr. Garner emerged
in front of the curtain and grew pathetic about
his financial misfortunes. The fact that Mr. G.
was badly damaged in the boom is well known,
but a man of his size can’t be pathetic with any
good effect. Neither can a short man. It is only
the tall, Apollo-like gent who can wail before a
Curtain with thoroughly satisfactory results to all
parties.

Colonel Fred. Hiscocks has resurrected his
Federal Minstrels for the third or fourth time —on
this occasion at the Sydney School of Arts. The
season opened well on Saturday night, and the
many well-wishers of the indomitable ’Murkan
warrior will be glad if it continues as it has begun.
The 00. includes a large number of new artistes,
and some of them look quite good enough to keep
the speculation afloat with a reasonable amount of
profit.

“ Charley’s Aunt ” is putting in the cur-
rent week at Melb. Princess’s, but on Saturday
that gay deceiver will remove to the Opera House
and trifle with Spettigue’s old affections some
more. A change has come over the spirit of
Auntie since her last visit to these parts. G. A.
Seagar (Penley’s under-study in London) fills the
name character vice Thornton, departed for home
on private business. Seagar is a chirpy, gentle-
manly little undergraduate, with sharp features,
and his performance, being something like what
would be expected of a lordling, contains much
less of broad humor than Thornton’s. Seagar
starts well, and in the third act he introduced a
touch of tender feeling for his auburn-haired
gyurl. As a source of outrageous merriment, he
suffers a good deal by comparison. Otherwise,
“ Charley’s Aunt ” is the same old show, moving
even faster than of yore perhaps, and, coming at
holiday-time, with special designs upon country
visitors, it is a well-seasoned production.
** * *
The Princess’s, on Saturday next, will be
made musical by the only Nellie, and re-decorated
with Brownlow’s royal legs. The Opera Company
opens a glad new season in “Ma Mie Rosette,”
under the special patronage of Manager William-
son, who is just about returning to Melbourne
with the Cup-winner up his sleeve. “ Paul
Jones”and “Mascotte” follow “Rosette,” each
opera being restricted to a two-night gallop.

Also, on Derby evening, Maggie Moore
reappears at the Royal in “Little Jack Shep-
pard,” which is another cause for satisfaction.
The advertisement casts a shadow of ‘'"coming
sorrow over this festive event by announcing a
positively farewell season of the people’s Maggie.
Seeing that she has positively fared well in all her
previous ventures at the same house, there seems
no reason why this well-beloved actress should
want to bid anyone adieu, and she will be ex-
pec tedi to prolong the agony of parting as much
as possible. Meanwhile, the Taylor-Oarrington
season is ending in a manner unspeakably slow.

Abel and Klaer’s Circus has located its
horses and things upon the St. Kilda-road site
formerly sacred to Fillis. The Coghill Bros.’
show at the Oxford was reinforced by Jennie Lee
and other variety items on Saturday. Some
changes at the Bijou include Gourlay, as “ Hamlet
in Five Minutes,” and a farce in place of the
operetta, though Miss Elster, it seems, will
reappear presently in a burlesque version of
“Maritana.” Little Cora Bailey cuts a bright
figure in the present Bijou bill with her imitation
of society skirt-dancing, which is a howling libel
on the amateur, Lethbridge, notwithstanding.

An unobserved sensation at Sydney Lyceum, the other
night, was the death of the drummer, who, poor fellow,
fell quietly across his instrument and expired. He was
removed without attracting any general attention, and
the opera went on as usual, another man pounding the
drum in the deceased’s place. There is always someone
waiting to get at the drum when the drummer drops in
front of the instrument.

The success of “The Fatal Card” has once more set
Haddon Chambers on his legs, and he is (says The Bulle-
tin’s London correspondent) as jaunty as in the prosper-
ous “ Idler ” days, during which he was really an idler.
Mrs. Janet Aohuroh Charrington was at latest contem-
plating a return to the stage, but had not decided which
of the many flattering offers made to her she would
accept. It was lately almost settled that she would appear
at the Haymarket in a play by Mannington Caffyn “ and
herself,” but that business is understood to be off. It is
not generally known that Mrs. Charrington has a rich
father living—which fact will account for several things.
The old gentleman was formerly connected with a large
insurance co., and retired with a handsome pension and a
considerable fortune to boot.
B. C. Stephenson, Haddon Chambers’ collaborator in
“ The Fatal Card,” was formerly secretary to Lloyd’s, a
billet worth £ISOO a year, which he rashly surrendered to
take up the precarious occupation of a scribbler. He has
since learned to regret his folly. By the way, Capt.
Henry Le Eatourel, of Sydney, was within an ace of
getting the secretaryship of Lloyd’s after Stephenson’s
retirement. He and the present holder of the office.
Colonel Hozier, were the two selected candidates out of
many hundreds.
Percy Grainger, the brilliant young pianist, covets but

May Cameron, the pretty little woman who could tie
herseU into knots without making a hideous spectacle of
the contortions, died in New York recently. Contortions
killed her, no doubt. When she was in Sydney with
Frank Clark’s co., some years ago, the doctors told May
that if she didn’t retrain from such habits as tapping the
back of her head with her foot when walking
stage fatal results would ensue. May Cameron leaves
children, by the way.
At the latest Vic. artists’ smoke-concert a young party,

Any burnt-cork pro. speaking the same lines at a ’all,

any other sort of mummer on earth.
A lady has appeared on Melb. Block with two dogs, big

J. J. Bartlett in the Prince of Wales Opera House, Castle-
reagh-street, when burned down in ’72. Apropos, it was
“Jimmy” Bartlett who, nearly 30 years ago, “dry-
nursed ” Bland and May Holt from England to Australia,
when they came to join their father, Clarence Holt, at

Brough and Bouoicault had only a moderate Adelaide

which she lighted a match on her knickers in “ The

It was Max O’Rell who induced R. S. Smythe to arrange
with Mrs. Annie Besant to visit Australia. The humorist
lives quite near to the Theosophical headquarters (“ The

doors of Henry Austin Jones, the dramatist, and ’Gus
Harris, of Drury Lane. O’Eell heard from Mrs. Besant’s
son-in-law in Melbourne that she wanted to come to Aus-

or otherwise? Perhaps youjwill be so good as to explain.

recalls Zangwill’s jokelet; “There are only two modern

Wilde as they did of old at Sheridan: “ His characters
speak too wittily.” The old relort does again—would
that all sinned thus! What fault does E.D. find with the
play? He can see the works 1 He admits the workman-
ship of the works is splendid. E.D. went to the theatre

art, and was disgusted.—Yours, &e., F.
The reason why Miln, as Othello, used to drag Desde-

was that Mrs. M. was a lady of rigid propriety, and

As to the idea of being dragged out in her bare feet,
Miln never even dared to suggest such realism.
There may be a few old parties in Australia who saw
Mdlle. Duvernay dance upon the London stage long, long
ago. Duvernay, a famous pirouettist in the days when a
prsmitlre d(nineuse. ranked higher than a prima-donna,
condescended to marry a banker as soon as public adula-
tion began to pall upon her soul. Duvernay, or Mrs.
Lyne Stephens, died last month, leaving the poor of her
neighborhood in tears. She had peeped into the hollow-
ness of this world, wherefore her married life was devoted
to deeds of charity and a general preparation of self and
family for the world to come. A man who weds a Bartho
from fleshly motives invariably gets left. By the time a
girl has learned to pose poetically upon one toe, her mind
has taken a serious turn, and the bouquets sent round to
her dressing-room are so many incentives to piety. “As
cold as a danseuse ,” wrote Balzac. He wasn’t, of course,
referring to skirt-whirlers, who are not notoriously icy.
Duvernay had no family and left her fortune of far over a
million to the two sons of General Claremont, an old
friend of hers.
An operetta is likely to be produced in a very exalted
locale, writes The Bulletin’s London correspondent, the
words of which are by a clever young journalist. The
name of another person will, however, appear as joint-
librettist. It comes about thus : The hard-up author was
one day sitting at lunch in the city at the same table as
the bogus-author, and, taking the MS. of the operetta out
of his pocket, said—“Here is a bit of stuff which will be
played in such and such a place, and it would be worth
£100 to any man who wants to get some kudos to have his
name on it. I want to pay a tailor’s bill, and anyone who
stumps down £26 on the nail shall have his name tacked
on with mine as the author.” No sooner said than done.
The cheeky advertiser—a now very well-known and pros-
perous person—produced the required cash, and will be
duly credited with the joint-authorship of the libretto of
an exceedingly pretty little musical trifle. This is how
many Australians in England—M.sP. and others—get
their names up. But Tub Bulletin has as little sympathy
with the man, however hard-up, cheeky enough to pro-
pose so miserable a literary fraud, as for the impostor
ready to buy and walk abroad in another man’s skin.

Venerable Johnny Toole has been guilty of a good story,
bearing upon bis awful book of “Reminiscences.” One
night, after giving a show in a small provincial town,
he took a stroll around and found a policeman, who
listened to him whilst he.made puns. The constable was
so very weak-minded that dear old Johnny thought ho
would appreciate a copy of his (J.L.T.’s) precious book.
“Do you like reminiscences'f" asked the venerable one.
“Thank you kindly,” said the policeman, “but—l'm
afraid there’s no house open.” He thought “remini-
scences ” meant something kept in the green bottle on
the top shelf.
Beaumont, the man-fish, who used to smoke under

Inigo Tyrrell, the actor-author, thus addressed a Melb.

Perhaps the one act of M.S.W. eX-Ghief
Justice Stephen’s long life which had the most
far-reaching consequences was (writes a well-
informed Bulletin correspondent) his discovery
of the non-validity of the titles to land granted
by Australian and Van Demonian Governors.
Stephen contended that the Governors had no
power to grant land in their own names, but only
as the King’s attornies. Up to that day all but a
few deeds of grant treated the respective
Governors as “ principal grantor,” and hence, he
argued, the deeds were void. The sequel of his
action need not now be recapitulated, but the
point is worth mentioning for the reason that, just
before declaring the grants void, Mr. Stephen, then
Attorney-General of V.U.L., sold a grant of a
ten-acre allotment, in Hobart Town, which had
been given to him under peculiar circumstances,
for 42700. By his own action, taken within three
mouths of sale, he pronounced the deeds of owner-
ship valueless. The peculiar circumstances just
alluded to may be inferred from the fact that this
particular block of land was the third grant
Stephen had received within four or five years.
His first grant (of rural land) was sold unimproved
by the value of one shilling, though a condition of
grant was improvement to a specified value.
His second grant was a maximum area, given
because of the improvement of the first, and this,
too, was sold unimproved. These are unquestion-
able facts, amplest official details respecting which
are accessible to-day.
John Dunn, the pious nonagenarian S.A.
miller, has bequeathed 4114,500 to charities in
such a way as to keep his name green as
long as possible. The gifts are to be doled
out in instalments ranging over many years.
John was chairman of the Mount Barker
foal of the National Ass, and his trustees
carried their political views even into the method
of publishing his post-mortem benefactions, for
they carefully boycotted the Advertiser. This
was peculiarly cruel, as that paper had devoted
five columns to the death and burial of the parsi-
monious old gentleman, and had perilled its im-
mortal soul by the nature and extent of its pos-
thumous eulogies. One story the biographer did
not tell. Long ago, when John Dunn was active
as chairman of District Council and parliamentary
representative for Mount Barker, he managed to
secure the exchange of a main road running dia-
gonally through his estate for a strip of land
round two of its sides. Then, in later days,
although he only used the paddock for gracing
purposes, he punished to the extent of fine and
imprisonment the workmen and boys of the local
foundry who tried to save an extra mile walk by
taking the beaten path across his property. On
one occasion the monopolist plaintively wrote to
the local editor that because, having caught them
red-handed, he tried to chevy some of the appren-
tices (making a short cut by stealth) out on to the
main road again, “they cald me a old , and
other probrus eppythuts.” He was no penman,
and his spelling was always ludicrously phonetic.

FLETCHER’S PILLS and CLEMENTS
TONIC are the recognised household remedies
of the Australian colonies, and every designing
quack tries to trade on their reputation and re-
nown. This is the greatest proof of their merit,
and sufferers want to be particular to get the
genuine articles, as regret and disappointment are
sure to follow the use of the thousands of “ All-
failing” remedies so freely advertised. The
reputation and wide-spread use of Clements
Tonic and Fletcher’s Pills are the greatest proofs
of their appreciation by the public. If they were
not as represented they would have passed out of
memory long ere this; but, instead, their sale is
greater and they are more esteemed day by day
and week by week, and this emphatically proves
their undisputed supremacy. Listen to no argu-
ment from interested parties ; demand the genuine
articles and TAKE NO SUBSTITUTE.

Where are the “ Duff ” terraces, “Duff” hotels,
or “Duff” neckties? True, there is the Duff
sulky. “ What’s in a name?”
The richest men in South Australia are
Angas and Barr Smith (millionaires), Gray, Elder,
Tennant, and Simms, each popularly assessed at
about £500,000. The poorest are—about 330,000
out of the population of 334,000.
A Vic. Anglican parson had to be sued for
the rates due on his house, and maintained that
the claim was illegal, because, “by statute, all
places ‘ used exclusively for religious purposes ’ are
exempt from taxation.” Clerical gall. This is
the sort of divine who eats a big dinner “exclu-
sively for religious purpose* ”
J. F. Hogan, M.P.,

Everybody has
charming recollections of
the original jin-de-sibcle
ballet in “ The Old
Guard.” Therefore, no
one needs reminding of
a certain young lady—
she of the orange-yellow
robe whose kick was
queen of all in the terpsi-
chorean poem aforesaid.
Miss Laura Healey was
that haunting vision.
Soon afterwards she dis-
appeared from Messrs.
Williamson and Garner’s
(as it was then) co., and
the proverbial old gentle-
man in the front row of
the stalls anointed his
baldhead with ashes. The
other week, Miss Healey
returned to professional
life in the capacities of
maitresse de ballet and
premiere danseuse (why
this French?) at Melb.
Bijou, where she may
nightly be seen as in the
picture. Miss Healey is
a dancer born and trained.
She had a long course of
tuition from Mrs. Royce
(herself a former pupil of
the indefatigable Mrs.
Conquest), under whose
care the Firm’s ballet
first became a bright,
partipular feature in their
comic-opera productions.
Of the ballerinas who
established such a high
standard of young Aus-
tralian dancing, none
have danced higher than
Laura Healey.
James Bell, M.L.C., was the Vic. Minister
of Defence mentioned by Max O’Rell as having
pointed out the dangers of London s exposed
position, and made recommendations for the
improved defence of the Thames.
One of the most conspicuous incidents in
the late Colonel Smith’s (Vic. M.L.A.) career
was the raffling of his residence, in Ballarat, at a
time when he was very hard up. The majah, for
such he was then, gathered together 3000 or so
participants at £1 each. He also took a chance
himself —and won the house.
levers, Yio, M.L.A. (who is about to
marry an £BO,OOO heiress), after a European trip,
a few years back, lectured on “ Europe Through
Young Australia’s Eyes." William, the “young

thereabouts.
O Melbourne Institution
(with a fine taste for tea)
Surgeon O’Hara and Attorney-General
Isaacs both employ lady secretaries. Mr. Isaacs,
whose wife is one of the prettiest women in Mel-
bourne, shares her ardent belief in the justice of
woman-suffrage. Both husband and wife play a
good game of billiards.
Mr. Henry, who showed up Mrs. Mellon,
the Sydney “spirit-medium,” is as a witness all
the more valuable by reason of the fact that up to
very recently he was a firm believer in the Mellon
manifestations, and had prepared a book entitled
“ Miracles in our Midst.”
David Syme is credited with the intention
of being chiefly concerned in starting a new even-

machinery shall not be used for starting another
paper for at least three years.
The funeral of Martin Burke, the steeple-
chase rider, filled Melb. city streets with specta-
tors. The crowd may not have been larger than
that which viewed Dean Macartney’s obsequies,
but it was different — it knew Burke, and his per-
formances were discussed all along the line. On
the other hand, there was a good deal of doubt
concerning the Dean and his duties. Nobody ,
could remember having backed the Dean’s mount.
When the late Martin Loughlin rolled
into Melb. Athenaeum Club, after being defeated i
in his effort to reach the Upper House, he was i
greeted with : “ Well, Martin, you got done ! ” i
“Yes, bedad,” replied Martin; “it was the
voting by ballast that bate me ! ”
Rev. W. Allen, the new chairman of
N.S. W. Congregational Union, was the cantata
prize-winner at Melb. Exhibition of six years ago.
Mr. Allen’s levelheadedness is proved by the fact i
that he did not regard that victory as an impera-
tive call to publish a book of poems.
With a view to the development of pork-
export, the Turner Government is strongly
supporting the pig-raising industry. As Attorney-
General Isaacs is a Jew, and Premier Turner and
Minister Best are both in partnership with Jews,
the movement is somewhat pig-euliar.
A distinguished Victorian dramatic critic,
who is also a cranky spook-hunter, is writing a
work on psychical research, his collaborator being
—Moses ! It is currently reported that St. Stead
had Jezebel as a collaborator when he scraped
together the social sewage of Ohicawgo.
Mr. Mellon, husband of the celebrated
Sydney spook-raiser, is a little man, thinner than
any of the ghosts which his wife conjures up. He
is a clerk in N.S.W. Public Works Department,
and will, no doubt, be expected to justify to his
official superiors his share in the recent sensational
seance.
The handsome Mrs. Alfred Deakin was
formerly an amateur spiritualistic medium. Deakin
himself, in his youth, was bitten with the spirit
craze, and wrote a book called “The New Pilgrim’s
Progress,” by “a writing medium.” He keeps
clear of stances now, however, and spooks trouble
him no more.
It is stated that Henry Kingsley, author of
“ Geoffrey Hamlyn.” who for a year or two was in
the N.S.W. mounted police, resigned his uniform
in disgust at having been compelled to attend at
an execution. That was about 1855 or 1856. Can
it have been Mary Brownlow’s execution? But
there were so many executions just then.
Many applications have been received for
the editorship of the new Sydney (labor) evening
journal. According to rumor, the Post, to which
will be attached a penny Sunday paper, will be
directed by an energetic and widely-experienced
scribe, lately of Ballarat and Melbourne, who,
years ago, made his mark in Sydney journalism.
Of a lately-deceased N.S.W. potentate,
who had so large a family that no one but himself
could count them, it is related that one evening at
a ball a married lady dared a certain sprightly girl
to ask the old man “ how many children he had.”
Replied the gay old warrior, fixing the girl with
his glittering eye, “Eighteenlegitimate, madam.”
An eminent pastoralist, who writes very
many letters, wrote to the non-unionist shearer
who wounded the two unionist rioters at Grasmere
station (N.S.W.), offering congratulations on his
marksmanship and the fact that he did not after-
wards seek to evade the onus of the shooting. He
also undertook to find work for said non-unionist
whenever the latter wanted it.
Mrs. Mannington Caffyn’s new novel, “ A
Strange Circumstance,” was to be published by
Hutchinson just after last mail left. A large sale
is anticipated, and the publisher has given such
big terms that it is said he will have to sell 9000
before he sees his money back. How do these
things leak out? The new book, by the way, is
not on the same lines as “ A Yellow Aster.”
Melb. Argus is getting along nicely. In
its biography of- James Anthony Froude :
In 1846 he took deacon’s orders in the Church of Eng-
land, but his intellect was too robust and his character
too independent to admit of his long remaining in it.
Which means, as clearly as can be, that the
Church of England is no place for a man with a
robust intellect and an independent character.
A Ooolgardie wire says that the local Vic-
torian miners “ are subscribing for the presenta-
tion of a belt to Dr. O’Hara, the clasp to be of
Coolgardie gold, having a laurel wreath in relief.”
Why? Dr, O’Hara is ten years younger than his
friend Purves; also, he boasts of being a heavy-
weight, whereas Purves is only a middle-weight.
It is against the laws of the P.R. for such to mill
together.
It may be objected to Louis Becke’s won-
derfully successful volume, “ By Reef and Palm ”
(South Sea stories reprinted from The Bulletin,
and published, at Is. 6d., by Fisher Unwin, of
London), that the yarns deal too exclusively with
the loves of white men and brown women. Becke
might easily plead that his stories are of the
Garden of Eden, wherein poor Adam has no
friends save Eve and the Devil.
The governor of a certain Australian gaol
has a little museum of knots of the ropes which
have done the work. He seems particularly proud
of the knot that encircled the neck of a woman
executed not long ago, as it has clinging in the
strands of the rope some of the hair of the con-
This official ghoul, when he desires to
specially honor the visitor to whom he is showing
Vis treasures, invites him to “ stroke the hair.”
Says Melb. Punch :
Mis. Annie Besant, the New Woman will be pleased to
hear, is a heavy smoker, even going to the extreme of a
biir pipe, but, like many other widows, she is fondest of
weeds.
“Many other widows,” as applied to Mrs, Besant,
is distinctly veracious. Mrs. Besant, as a fact,
does not smoke even cigarettes, and has precious
little sympathy with the “modern woman,” as
commonly depicted.
Elliott, one of the discoverers of the
famous Londonderry mine, was a milkman at
Charlton (Vic.) ere he went to West Australia 18
months ago. Also he was poor, and apparently
dying of phthisis, and his friends loudly con-
demned his folly in going to seek a grave in the
i arid West. Perhaps they were right, for poor
, Elliott is said to be dying now—but not before he
provided a handsome fortune for his wife and
family.
When Martha Needle was hanged at Melb.
Gaol, a spectator, present on a sheriff’s order,
wrote down in the visitors’ book in the column
headed “ Business ” the word “ Curiosity.” This,
at least, had the merit of honesty. But it did not
suit the official idea of the dignity of the function,
and the visitor was told to alter it. Then he
wrote “Scientific,” crossingout “Curiosity.” The
man who did this was Mr. John Watson, of the
well-known sporting family.
Pee Yung, a Chinese storekeeper who got
.£5OO compensation for the destruction of his stock
at Lambing Flat riots, is a notable member of
the Chow community in Sydney. He was at
Ballarat in ’52, and has kept stores in every Aus-
tralasian province. A big slice of Pee Yung’s
fortune is locked up in one of the reconstructed
banks, and he religiously visits the manager every
Monday morning with the oft-repeated query,
“ When you tink I get him back?”
Dr. John Donovan is the first equity
barrister who has “taken silk” in N.S. Wales since
the days of Alex. Gordon. The new Q.C. is also
a Knight of the Roman Order of St. Gregory, a
“ distinction ” bestowed upon him by the Pope in
recognition of the large sums which he has given
for religious and charitable purposes. It is a
standing joke with Sydney lawyers when applied
to for subscriptions or charity to blandly refer the
applicant to Dr. Donovan, “ who is always
anxious to assist, you know,”
There was a strong physical resemblance
between Martha Needle and Madeline Smith, the
“heroine” of the famous Edinburgh poisoning-
case of 37 years ago. Both were good-looking
women ; both had close, short, curly, brown hair;
and there was a singular facial likeness. The
present writer knew Madeline Smith a few years
ago in London, where she lived under the name of
“ Mrs. Wardle.” When her identity was revealed
she suddenly left England, and for some time lived
in Victoria as the wife of a doctor in a Southern.
seaside town.
The death of his wife some weeks ago has
given much pain to the veteran Townsend M‘Der-
mott, Victoria’s leading mining barrister. Mr.
M‘Dermott is about the best-known man in the
province, and a universal favorite from the news-
boys up to the Chief Justice. Every year he
invariably packs up and starts out for the Melb.
Cup, but on “ the day ” he has a few people to
see, and by the time the race is over he has just
about- managed to get as far as Scott’s hotel.
However, he has been known on one occasion to
journey as far as Spencer-street.

Batchelor, M.P. (S.A.), wants to extend
the eight-hours system to all branches of S.A.
public service, or, in other words, to increase the
working-hours of the “dude” departments by
nearly ten hours a week. A merciless proposal.
Reid, Kingston and Turner —the Premiers
of three divisions of Australia—are lawyers. This
omens badly for law reform, and threatens
Federation with a surfeit of verbal tricks. At
least it would if the three were very accomplished
lawyers.
Chief Secretary Gordon (S.A.) says that
in future men will grow rich, not by increasing
their possessions, but by moderating their desires.
Lop your toes off to get your boot on. It will be
a bad day for humanity when Gordon’s expecta-
tion is realised.
The frantic leaflet, full of blood and
dynamite and sudden death, which was lately
circulated in the alleged interests of the Queens-
land shearers, is said to have been written by a
Maoriland lady, one of the lights of the woman
suffrage movement.
Bibbs: “If Mr. Brunker told the truth
always he would have been hanged long ago.”
Partially true, anyhow. He mightn’t be hanged,
but Brunker or any other man who always told
the truth would either be clubbed to death or
would die in gaol for unpaid libel damages. A
habit of always telling the truth is the most
ruinous, unchristian and ungentlemanly trait that
anyone could acquire.
Gladstone, speaking once at Liver-
pool, complained that foreigners said :
“You have mounted to wealth by the
ladder of Protection. You kick it down,
and want to prevent us treading in your
footsteps.”
Patterson jocularly threatened to go
to war about the territory in dispute be-
tween S. A. and Vic., and both provinces
laughed. But Premiers Turner and King-
ston are both lawyers, and people begin to
think that war would really be cheaper
than a lawsuit.
The S.A. Railway Commissioners
originally affirmed that the cost of intro-
ducing the Eight Hours’ system in their
department would be £60,000 annually.
It has been in vogue now for nearly two
years and they say it costs £22,000 per
annum. Labor-member Batcher, who for
some time worked in the locomotive
shops, puts the extra cost at under £5OOO,
and Treas. Holder agrees that is nearer
the mark.
Victorian: “Our Education Act was
passed in a panic over larrikinism, but has
failed to touch it. There is no use trying
to introduce evangelism in the schools, or
imagine that the study of legends will affect
moral character. Higinbotham tried to
give us the right legislation. The school
must be an education of _ character, as well
as a mere paeking-in of information. r lhe
schoolmaster is a distinctly inferior man,
on the average. He ought to be best,
and best paid, in the community.”

me uhers’ ” wives, sisters, _ and cousins

The farther drop of £4OOO a week in the
Vic. railway revenue, as compared even with the
emaciated figures of last year, means dreadful

the bow.
Single-tax theories don’t fit in with facts-
Sydney D.T. asserts that “ Where the necessaries
of life are easily obtainable —or, in other words,
where they are cheap—rent rises ; where they are
not, it falls.” The necessaries of life are now very
cheap in Sydney—never were cheaper —yet rents
are falling.
The Northern Jap objects to work beside
the Kanaka. Consequently, he creeps into the
mill. Intelligent, industrious, and penurious, he

farthing in the country.
Twenty-five out of 31 Victorian M.’sL.A.
unseated at last election still retain their free
passes, and some of them, at all events, use them
for travelling purposes. It is announced that
they are to be “ written to ” requesting them to
discontinue the swindle. Any ordinary person
thus travelling on an expired ticket would be
arrested at once, hut the fraudulent ex-legislator
is only “written to.” In other words, some
person in authority takes it upon himself to
suspend the law for his own purposes, whatever
these may be, and the community is so miserably
corrupt that he is allowed to state openly that he
is doing so without anybody arising and ejecting
him from office.
Notice of motion by Kelly, M.H.R. of
Maoriland:—
To ask the Minister for Defence if his attention has
been drawn to the following cablegram: “A lunatic
rushed to shake hands with the Duke of York on the
occasion of a State entry into Leeds. One of the escorting
Lancers slashed the man’s arm and another rode him
down.” If so, will the Minister for Defence take the
necessary steps to issue instructions to the military who
may be selected to act as guard of honour to the Duke of
York, when visiting the colony, not to cut and slash the
arms of ail lunatics who may become possessed of a desire
to shake hands or rub noses with a member of the Royal
Family.”
Seddon, who expects to be ennobbled himself some
day, rose with a wild roar of indignation when
this notice was handed in. There is no sense of
humor about a man who is waiting for a title.

If there is to he a difference in N.S.W.

favor of country workmen, not against them.
Australia should try by every possible means to

A dispute has arisen at Adelaide re the
amount of probate-duty payable on a certain
6 ),000-acro estate. Government says it is worth
£25,000; the estate trustees’ valuator says only
,£6OOO. No such dispute could exist for a week
if the State had power to take over, at the
trustees’ own valuation, any such property.
Premier Bibbs, when he appointed Gov.
Duff’s ex-private secretary, the newly-imported
Mr. Galton, to write the history of N.S. Wales,
overlooked one little matter : he did not get the
appointment Executively ratified, so that the con-
tract is now declared invalid. It remains to be
seen what Premier Reid will do in the matter.
Better pay Mr, Galton reasonable compensation
and let him go, than have the history of Australia
written by a gentleman with the English fog still
heavy on his soul.

Max O’Rell on the thirsty Australian :
In the town of X. (Victoria) I had occasion to go and
see the mayor. I found him tipsy. On leaving his
presence I went to the office of the town clerk. He was
tipsy. From there my manager and I went to call upon
the director of the principal hank. He was tipsy. The
proprietor of the hotel where I was staying was in bed,
suffering from delirium tremens.
Max does seem to have had rather a drying effect
upon the Australians generally.
“ Oh for a second Daniel ! ” is the burden
of the song of N.S.W. postal-employees. When
Kidd was Postmaster-General the building was
always swarming with old women of both sexes
belonging to the Social Gimlet and Cold Water

ever a door shuts or opens it reveals either the
coat-tails or the plain and sanctified countenance
of the everlastingly-grinning parson.
Handsome “ Jim ” Coates — he is now
about 40—was offered the presidency of the
8.N.Z., at a salary of ,£2500 per annum, but his
three years’ engagement as general manager of
National Bank of N.Z.— an appointment which
he had just received—precluded him from accept-
ing the flattering offer. Mr. Coates is the
youngest son of a Govt, official who came to
Maoriland in the train of the first Governor, Capt.
Hobson.
Once when Ewing, N.S. Wales M.P., was
a surveyor, his cook left the camp without giving
notice, and Ewing proceeded to cook a “ duff ” for
Sunday’s dinner. He forgot to allow for swelling,
and the duff couldn’t be got out of the pot till an
axe was brought and the pot smashed. Then it
was found that the cloth had not been greased, so
the duff had to be oaten cloth and all. Then the
future statesman and philosopher went away and
hired a cook.
Jerome advertises that the next number of
his monthly, The Idler, will contain an original,
thrilling Australian story by Jerome K. Jerome,
Eden Philpotts, F. Benson, F. Moore, and Barry
Pain. The point of this lies in the fact that none
of these people were ever within a thousand miles
of Australia, and that Jerome is under the im-
pression that people walking on the Block in
Melbourne sometimes go too far, and get lost ki
the dense bush.
The sentencing to death for the murder of
his step-sister, of Elijah Cockroft, the Vic. jockey-
boy, stands as another awful warning to the godly
sponsors who would foist on blue-eyed babes such
cognomens as Elijah, Luke, Ebenezeror Matthias,
Just as Matthiases generally run to forgery or
trust-fund embezzlement, Ebenezers branch out
into more primitive methods for the redistribution
of wealth, such as garrotting or burglary with
violence. But to call a boy Elijah is tantamount
to consigning him to the gallows. In fact,
Elijah is “ short ” for a soaped rope and a dull,
sickening thud.
Bear Bulletin, —From your issue of Oct.
27, it would appear that Mr. J. J. Fitgerald, who
is said to have distinguished himself at the
Redondo wreck, accompanied Warburton, the
explorer, on his trip in the north-west of the
continent. On page 139 of “A. Journey Across
the Western Interior of Australia,” by Col. Peter
Egerton Warburton, the author writes, just after
the departure of Mr. Burt, who returned to
Adelaide at the last moment
The party now consisted of myself, my son (Richard
Egerton Warburton), J. W. Lewis, Sahleh and Halleem
(two Afghan camel-drivers), Dennis White (cook and
assistant camel-man), and “ Charley " (a native lad).
Lewis, who was the hero of the trip, and but
for whose presence in the party they would pro-
bably have all left their bones in the sand-hills,
lies in an unmarked grave in the far north-west,
whilst Warburton, who pushed on, simply boring
straight ahead to reach settlement, until they had
lost everything but two camels, lives in history
as an explorer of note. I am not in a position to
say positively that there was no one of the name
of Fitzgerald in the party that went back to
bring in the bodies of Burke and Wdls, but I am
almost sure that the party included no one of that
name, and in a day or two will send you a list
of the party. —D.
“Reporter”: “Ex-Premier Patterson
will be chiefly remembered by Melb. pressmen as
the bon carnarade of Ministerial trips. No

kindness on these occasions quite disarmed any
suspicion of special motive, whether it existed or
not.”

Dining at the Metropolitan with a number of
squatters who became very vinous and very up-

hour, his example being soon followed by a well-
known pastoralist. A certain burly squatter,

back to the banquet, rushed into a bedroom,
seized a sleeper, bedclothes and all, and carried
to the festive scene —the astonished Governor !
Theodore Fink,

When a close
division was ex-
pected down South,
the other day, on an
important clause of

denly found that the

emissaries looked
for him in 16 hotels
before they found
him, and when he
was found and
roped in he fell on
his hands in the
lobby and proved
hopelessly unman-
ageable. A care-
fully-devised sys-
tem of pairing the

The cabled death of Viscount Drumlanrig
(Queensberry’s eldest son) recalls Miss Braddon’s
dull story “ Thou Art the Man.” The heroine’s
lordly spouse was found lying beside a hedge with
a bullet in his heart, just as Drumlanrig was dis-
covered. Also, the tragedy was ascribed to an
accident—the trigger ot the lord’s gun was sup-
posed (like Drumlanrig’s) to have been pulled by a
briar bough—whereas the villain of the story had
waited in ambush and brought down his prey as
he prepared to get through the hedge.
When “King” Tawhiao was in London
he was taken to a big firework exhibition at the
Crystal Palace. To the general surprise he paid
no attention to the illuminations, but the crowd
seemed to fascinate him. Asked afterwards what
had interested him most he replied : “ The tramp,
tramp, tramp of the people.” Poor old Tawhiao
had never imagined before that there were so
many people in existence. All savage nations have
difficulty in understanding what myriads civilisa-
tion opposes to them. Most Indian rebellions
against U.S. Govt, were started in the belief that
there were only a few thousand whites to be killed
altogether.
By the death of ex-Judge Stephen, a
Supreme Court pension (.£1820) is saved to N.S.
Wales province. Another pension, that of ex-
Justice Faucett, lately fell in. There are but two
now “on the listex-Judge W. M. Manning
(.£2620) and ex-Judge Deffell (=£1820), the latter of
whom is spending in England the evening of his
life. The veteran ex-Judge Manning’s extreme
weakness causes much anxiety to his friends. He
is now 83, and has during the last few years
awakened much sympathy among the Democratic
party by the hearty liberalism displayed in his
Legislative Council speeches and votes.
When a man in his prime
Can earn three meals a day,
Have a pint for his supper
And a seat at the play,
Then an old man may live
If he does what he’s able
To gather the crumbs up
That drop from the table.
But when men in their prime
Can get little to eat,
No seat to their trousers
Or boots on their feet
Then old men must starve
Tho’ they do what they’re able,
There’s no crumbs to fall
From the other chap’s table.
Life! What is It?
It is interesting to know that in connection with
each cell in the body there are two channels or
passages. Through one of these canals a stream
of pabulum is constantly flowing ; while there is
carried away by means of the other what is known
as formed material. The cell itself is germinal
matter. The pabulum stream flows into the cell,
the formed material is cast aside by it after the
performance of its proper functions. The distance
intervening between each of these germinal cells
is only l/500th part of an inch. It is not generally
known that the whole of the body is not alive.
Indeed, the germinal part does not make up over
a third of the. whole body. The other parts con-
sist of pabulum and formed material, and it is
only the germinal ttia't really lives. The body is
in a constant flux, btUlding up and breaking down.
The pabulum becomes the germinal, and that in
time gives place to formed material. It will be
seen that the cells appropriate the pabulum and
convert it into germinal. If this life-giving stream
ceased its How, death would at once ensue. The
importance, therefore, of keeping the system un-
encumbered and perfectly balanced, and easy in
its great work, is apparent. If the stomach is
deranged the pabulum becomes charged with
deleterious matter, and the result is suffering and
disease. Pay due attention to the liver, kidneys
and stomach, and little danger need be feared. If,
however, they be neglected or outraged by excess
of any kind, nature, being inexorable, demands a
penalty. The safest and surest of all medicines
for liver and kidney disease and all disorders of
the stomach is Warner’s Safe Cure. It not only
combats existing evils, .but it prevents disease. It
attacks the seat of the trouble and speedily checks
further spread of nervous loss that otherwise takes
place. Warner’s Safe Pills may be taken without
hesitation, and are of such excellent worth that
no one should be without them. In all cases of
indigestion, bilious attack, flatulence, heartburn
and irritation of any kind they will be found in-
valuable.

My long- acquaintance with the Kooweemp country
justified me in then comdemning in your columns the
scheme adqpted by the engineers. V At this juncture I
again point out that the most of the money expended
w the drainage works in the last two years is wasted.
Tor the bulk of the land comprised in the Kooweemp
area is by your special reporter pron'ounced unworkable.
I have watched this work closely, seen the surveyors
“up to their armpits in water’’ laying out settlers’
blocks ; have pulled the wrenched would-be-settlers out
of the water, rubbed life into them, and fed them until
they were able to journey back to Melbourne. Ire-
member, as many will, the big woman and her little hus-
band, coming with a batch of unemployed, from Bunyip
station on to the surveyed lots, turning upon her hus-
band and saying, “ You’ve brought me to settle here,’’
then knocking the poor little chap flat on his back in
the mud, and, without another word, marching back -to

in their homes could not use stretchers for their beds,
as the legs of the stretchers disappeared in the mud ;
the men Jhafl jo sleep on fascines of ti-tree in their huts
or lose the Government work- A man, complaining
that water flowed through the hut in which he had
caught an eel, was answered by the Government
engineer—“l give you land, I givexyou work, I give
yon eels. What more doi-you want ?” I merely
mention these facts in corroboration of your reporters
statements as to the discomfort and irritation of, the
struggling settlers.

Society
Misfortunes never come singly. The cul-
•chawed section of Sydney Spiritualasses, just now
crushed by the Mellon affair, have got some bad
news from America. A month or two back a
seance was held at the house of a well-known lady,
and attended by most of the individuals concerned
in the latest exposure. No “materialisations”
were performed, but the medium, a Sydney
“Johnnie,” while in an alleged trance-state, uttered
much guttural gibberish, and led his hearers to
believe that his “ spook-control ” was a Sioux
chief. So interested were the enthusiasses, that
they engaged a shorthand-writer to take down
the sounds as uttered by the Johnnie while under
ghostly spell. The report so obtained was handed
to the ’Murkan consul, who readily expressed his
willingness to forward it to Washington, and have
the lingo examined. A reply has now come, to
the effect that the words sent were not part of any
American native dialect; also, that experts had
expressed the opinion that they were part of no
language on this sinful earth.
• * *
Perhaps the most ludicrous feature of that
spiritualistic seance exposure was the presence of
a “lady palmist,” who had a few days before paid
hush-money to stop a blackmailer’s mouth regard-
ing the inwardness of palmistry. Now, her worst
■enemy would not suppose Mrs. Mellon fool enough
to give herself away like that. Evidently there
is more in spiritualism than in palmistry, another
:Sunday-(paper industry.
• • •
The spiritualistic argument that “ mani-
festations ” are made impossible by the presence
■of unbelievers at a seance is a weak “ gag,” albeit
■one can’t think of a better. Time was when all
humanity believed in ghosts and witchcraft;
-when there were no unbelievers, as the term is
mow understood. But in those favorable times
mediums didn’t exist; classic literature tells no
tales of them, table-turning was unknown, and
the tricks common alike to “ mediums ” and pro-
fessed showmen hadn’t come into vogue.
Spiritualism is a cheap, modern invention
adapted to the wants of a few people whose
imaginative faculty is too strong for the rest of
their minds. Although able men of science are
always ready to entertain the “manifestation
theory, no strong intellect has been convinced
by the modern spook. The Asiatic races are
the most proficient in tricks that are vain, and
one of these days we shall hear of a Australianised
Chow giving stances that will make Mrs. Mellon
appear a crude amateur at the business.
* * *
For the past three months the honafides
af the “Mellon” spirits has been doubted by a
number of people who remarked that Mrs. Mellon,
when entering the cabinet fora “ materialisation,’
seemed decidedly plumper than usual.
• * •
One of the worst pieces of evidence against
Mrs. Mellon is that she struggled to free herself
when amateur-detective Henry seized her wrists.
Why did she not calmly remain “ held ” and
explain the phenomena to all present? Why
should she, whose mission it is to call up departed
souls, struggle like an irate schoolboy in a football
scrimmage?
LAW OUT WEST .
BANKRUPT: “ Wha-wha-what’ll yer charge ter
ask yer a question? ”
SOLACITOR: “ Come on , man, let's have it."
BANKRUPT: “ Waal, what’ll yer charge ter put
me through the court;"
Before Dr. M‘Carthy proceeds any further
with “ peeping and muttering,” he ought to
investigate the case of a certain Bathurst vagrant,
who was once a remarkable medium, and who,
per hap * in consequence, is now a physical and
mental wreck.
Melons, scooped out, with holes for eye
and a candle stuok inside, have been used fo r
ghost-raising purposes since the remotest antiquity.
* * •
Now that the “materialising” swindle is
scuttled, isn’t it time to put the auger into the
palmistic humbug? Whatever relation may exist
between material marks and moral tendencies,
when we come to the bastard-astrological patter
we strike rubbish pure and simple. The double
flaw in the reasoning lies in the assumption of a
connection between the imaginary characteristics
of an imaginary deity and the “influence” of a
heavenly body arbitrarily named after that
deity. The astrologo-palmist impostorsinay talk
round this logical nut till doomsday—it is abso-
lutely uncrackable !
* * *
A Vic. R.C. priest has been fined £5O for
smuggling five sets of clerical vestments over the
border. The Church is inconsistent. When it
makes the citizen pay mass-duty to get over the
wall of purgatory into its protected Heaven, the
least it can do is to hand a lictle of the cash back
to Caesar in return for the right to wear gay
clothes upon the State’s protected earth. His
reverence is a custom-house officer at the gate of
Paradise, and should have a fellow-feeling for his
kindred at the gate of Victoria.
• * •
The story goes that the aforesaid prosecu-
tion originated in a dispute between the priest
and the local sergeant of police, culminating in a
blistering letter written by his reverence to the
local Archimedean lever, wherein the officer was
informed “ that his time would be better spent in
prosecuting thieves and such like than bringing
cab-drivers and * barber-men who ran totes ’ up
to their proper bearings.”
* * •
Apropos of the bizarre daylight Block dis-
play of affection on the part of a tall and well-
known pair, it is remarked that it must be the
man who is most “struck,” for he lovingly holds
her arm. Generalisation : Before marriage, the
man holds the woman’s arm, for he has her. After
marriage, she holds his arm, for then she has him.
* * *
The champion mean man has been
found at last —by a well-known Australian
legal firm. The Scottish lover of a Sydney girl,
before dying (some three years ago), made out
his will, leaving her his all (about £5OOO in cash),
but through a sudden relapse, delayed signing
“until the morning.” He died in the night, and
so the lady could not legally claim anything, and
had to “take the will for the deed.” The solici-
tors were greatly helped by the girl in endeavour-
ing to trace the dead man’s relatives, but none
could be found, until at length she remembered
her fiance having once mentioned some far-out
Caledonian cousin. This personage was adver-
tised for and found in Scotland. He came to
Australia and called upon the solicitors, who
pointed out the accident that had given him pos-
session of the .£5OOO (which morally belonged to
tho young lady), and suggested that he should
give her a handsome share. To this he enthu-
siastically agreed, and next day forwarded a
cheque —for £lo—which was, of course, indignantly
returned ! This distinguished philanthropist is
now again in Scotland.
m * *
Apropos that Firemen’s Widows’ and
Orphans’ Fund which Sydney society is trying to
raise. Why should it be necessary to appeal to
“charity” on behalf of the family of a fireman
killed in the performance of his duty? Ordinary
Government clerks, who neither die of overwork,
nor are liable to injury or death in the ordinary
course of duty, get pensions, but firemen and
certain classes of railway servants carry their
lives in their hands and may be crippled or killed
any day. Why should they or their families not
have a regular provision made for them, instead
of being left to depend on the charity-monger ?
Owing to the opera-
tion of the “ noxious
trades law ’’ the N.S.W,
farmers and squatters
refuse to sell meat to
country people. Some
bush teachers now have
to go many miles for a
little meat, formerly ob-
tained from the nearest
squatter.
* * *
The granting to civil
servants of leave-of-ab-
sence goes by favor.
“ White-headed boys” of
departments can get leave
on almost any excuse.
Three N.S.W. civil ser-
vants, for instance, have
been granted leave - of-
absence of from three to
six months in order to
get “ cured ” at a retreat
for inebriates.
The humble mang,r of the meek and
lowly evangelist M‘Neill and his assistant Burke,
when in Sydney, was that palatial hostelry The
Hotel Australia. The godly pair are understood
to have had on hand after their Sydney crushing
a very big ball of amalgam, which no doubt has
by now been duly smelted. However, those who
preach the gospel should live (at the Hotel Aus-
tralia—new version) by the gospel. Mr.
M'Neill is probably a whole-souled saint,
whose . misfortune it is that he was not born
ascetic-looking. He who is a hairy evangelist
with a hull neck and a voice to match, and is im-
pelled by a sense of duty to his physical well-
being to mortify the flesh at the Australia, has
indeed a heavy cross to bear. Despite the sneers
of scoffers, Mr. M‘Neill may yet pan out as satis-
factorily from a self-denying point of view as did
the old Victorian clergyman whose estate, as dis-
closed to his executors a year or two ago, con-
sisted solely of two coppers in the pockets of a
rusty old black waistcoat found hanging behind
the door of the room in which he died.
» * *
Skirt-dancing left the stage to invade the
sanctity of the drawing-room, and now the living-
picture craze bids fair to follow its example. A
Melb. man, just back from London, describes
some amateur tableaux he witnessed at the May-
fair mansion of a well-gilt Australian, and,
according to his account, the maids and matrons
of high English sassiety are just beginning where
the professional poseuses left off. Possibly this is
owing to the fact that the former are not actuated
by desire for gain, but by love of art, for “one volun-
teer is worth three pressed men.” The central figure
was the wife of an Earl, who, with her husband,
visited the Australias a couple of years since.
Whilst here her figure was the feature of all
Guvmentouse balls, and the returned tourist says
that the remainder of it quite fulfils the numerous
promises given through the draperies of an even-
ing dress. The picture represented by this dame
was Solomon J. Solomon’s Judgment of Paris, and
the success was accentuated by her striking facial
resemblance to the Helen.

The chaplain charged with the saving of
Martha Needle’s demented soul seems to have
made himself unpleasant to the miserable woman
on the Sunday before her execution. Martha had
always enjoyed the idea that Otto Juncken, the
man she loved in her own arsenious fashion, didn t
believe her guilty of poisoning his brother.
Juncken did his best to soothe the doomed
creature by saying what she was glad to hear in
the accents of one who meant it, and although the
prison shepherd apparently implored him to make
Martha miserable, lie refused to change his policy.
When Otto Juncken parted from the prisoner on
g
“ TRAINED!”
“ Who's that. Bill?”
“Oh! a trained nurse.”
“ Trained nurse! Why, she's h[?]g-fat !”
Sunday morning he left her so sinfully comfort-
able that the shepherd could bear it no longer. He
went into the penitent’s cell and stated that
Juncken did believe she was guilty, whereupon
Martha reviled the bearer of glad tidings and
nearly had a fit. Nothing more came of this
miserable attempt to accomplish Martha’s salva-
tion—it merely filled her with loathing for her
ghostly comforter. Martha retired to rest with
an uneasy mind, angry at the thought that she
might have been fooling herself, but still clinging
to the hope that the parson was a meddlesome
perverter of the blessed terewth.
* * *
When Martha Needle was waiting in
Melb. gaol to be hanged for poisoning her family,
she had for attendant a woman who has for many
years past been steadily working through a life-
sentence for poisoning her husband. Possibly the
selection was made by accident. Possibly it was
intended as an obscure kind of humor. Or, again,
it might have been made with a dull, ox-like idea
of maintaining the general fitness or things, or
because the authorities imagined it would make
the gaol seem a little more home-like for the
doomed Martha.

widowhood enjoys a snug pension from the
Imperial Government, and is of the Mrs. Yates
type, but with strong views on Anglican church

Thebarton is a suburb of Adelaide (S.A.).
It used to be a good old working-man’s suburb—
what Surry Hills is to Sydney, or Collingwood to

re-christened. It aches for a more “ toney ’’name.
And its would-be sponsors want to christen it

which? If both, how? One M.P.’s name is

When you see the long, low wool-shed, the sheep
you used to shear,
The boss who once would welcome you, the
troopers standing near,
The silent, half - filled shearing - board, the
“ learner ” at your “ pen,”
The shamefaced, skulking rouseabouts (some whom
you knew as men
Forget, somehow, to greet you now), the “ roll ”
you cannot sign—
You curse the Squatters’ Union, and sigh for auld
lang syne.
When idly lying in the camp you hear the tidings
read
That so-and-so is “ giving in ” at such-and-such a
shed ; ....
Of conflicts with the black-leg mob, of triumphs
over laws,
You feel, if need be, you could die for such a
rightful cause;
You push the greasy cards aside to write your girl
a line,
And laud the Workers’ Union —yet sigh for auld
lang syne.
When riding homeward penniless, you light your
pipe and think
This somewhat like the time you “ swamped ’
your hard-earned cheque in drink ;
You picture the fair downcast face (the face that
you adore)
When telling her the long-planned home must be
a dream once more;
You give your horse a savage “dig,” you wonder
if you’ll dine,
And “ growl ” at both the unions, and sigh for
auld lang syne.

Alice Norris, described by the police as a
respectable woman, has twice been sent to gaol in

“think hard.” “The celibate system,” said
Heaton, “may be good or bad, but in it un-
doubtedly lies much of the strength of the R.O.
Church. Years ago the wills of Dr. Vaughan
and Dr. Barker, respectively the chief Roman
Catholic and Anglican prelates of Australia, were
proved in Sydney. Both wills were very short
and consisted of but a few lines. ‘I leave,’ said
the R.O. Bishop, ‘all my property, wheresoever
and whatsoever, save .£2OO, the amount of a debt I
owe t 0 , to my successor, the R.O. Arch-
bishop of Sydney.’ The Anglican Bishop’s will,
on the other hand, left everything holus-bolus to
‘my beloved wife.’ Both amounts were large-
something over £50,000 in each case.” Thus one
in his Sydney home thought only of his church ;
the other left all to “petticoats.” Apart from
the mere monetary bequest, how much one man’s
will must have done for, and how much the other’s
against, his church !
The Anglican Church proposes to start a
self-denial week throughout Australia so as to
raise another £lO,OOO to pay for missionaries to
go forth and talk the “ heathen ” into an early
grave. The Bulletin would like to point out to
these people the ghastly, hog-like meanness of this
“self-denial” business. The process consists in
pinching a few shillings off the already stunted
grocery or butchery bill, and considering _ that
prices have already been cut to about the minimum
at which the tradesman can live, it only requires a
little more self-denial to shunt him into bank-
ruptcy. Self-denial consists mostly of denying
some one else. Even self-denial for the sake of
helping the hungry women and children at our
own doors, though it is a virtue, is not all virtue,
while the same kind of economy, when practised
to circulate abroad an impossible yarn about an
ark, is the meanest, lowest, and most stupidly
wicked proceeding this paper knows of. The
present writer, at all events, doesn’t envy the
death-bed feelings of the man who has habitually
denied himself for the heathen.

Wellington (M.L.) has at last found an
English parson to accept its vacant bishopric.
The billet has been hawked round England for a
year past, and seven preachers, to whom it was
successively offered, have thrown it derisively at
the head of the despised “kawliney.” The eighth
man has taken it under great pressure, and is
coming out, when he is sufficiently rested, with
the expression of a holy martyr, to take up his
cross and screw. Considering all the abasement
which is required to obtain an English bishop,
this country—if it really can’t put up with the
local article —had better swear off bishops alto-
gether.

The case of that Melbourne girl named
Jones, who swallowed a huge dose of poison
because her brother was served with a small-debt
summons, is another evidence of the unbusiness-
like nature of woman in general. The poor girl
evidently had a vague idea that people were
crucified, or loaded with chains and thrown into
noisome dungeons, for their unpaid tailors’ bills,
and she wanted to die and get away from the
tragedy. Her own tragedy had the usual nn-
picturesque ending. She was resuscitated in the
hospital, and then the P.M. talked to her in
court like a disgusted father, and sent her home
again.

Sydney Woman’s Voice on bazaars ;
We have at the present moment, here in our great
Australian cities, hundreds of women who barely keep
within the narrow line outside which lies starvation or
prostitution. They have never been taught means
whereby to earn a living. They can do little or nothing
but needlework or fancy-work. Every bazaar undersells
them, and, in the name of Christ, asks a blessing on the
traffic—a traffic that competes with the labor of the
destitute, and coaxes the bread-money from the channel
where it might reach the starving. It is well known that
dozens of articles are sold at every bazaar at a price
barely sufficient to cover the cost of the material, and
women with an insane love of bargains will buy them,
and by so doing establish a price at which no one can
earn a pittance. A case in point may serve as an illus-
tration. Twenty years ago a woman, old beyond hard
work, and almost destitute, made a bare living by knitting
babies* boots. They were sold in the shops which she
supplied at 2s. 6d. a pair, and the price which she
received for them enabled her to earn, after paying for
the wool, a poor living. Two pairs of boots a day is good
work. The same boots are now sold at the bazaars, on
the last day, for what they will bring, or they are put
into a fish-pond, or a bran-pie, for the service of God and
the church, and the old woman may starve.
Good, But if women are learning to reason like
this, what is to become of Clericalism ?

“ Why does not God kill the Devil ?” was
the subject of a recent sermon by parson Isaac
Selby, ex-freethought propagandist, in Melb.
recently. “The Devil is kept alive,” Isaac con-
cludes, “to furnish a great object-lesson to the
universe of the inutility and the damnable char-
acter of rebellion.” Considering that the Devil’s
rebellion is the moat successful movement on
record, Nick can hardly be typical of inutility-
The Rev. Selby will probably tell us that the
skunk exists to furnish people with practical
assurance of the nastiness of bad smells. As a
matter of fact, the Devil is kept alive to propitiate
the clergy.

Dear Bulletin, —Talking of “champion
gormandisers ” : I was once at a telegraph-line
construction camp in Queensland, and among the
workers there was a mighty gorger. His camp-
name was “Silly Suffolk,” because of the English
county from which he hailed. That camp’s cook
used to give his men porridge for breakfast every
morning—actually porridge in sweaty Bananaland .
Deep tin plates—you know the style each full of
porridge. “Silly Suffolk” was, as he admitted,
“middlin’ partial” to porridge. Six of these
platefuls was a very ordinary preliminary canter
to a more solid feed of corned beef (say 2|lb._),
spuds (say 21b.), and soda-bread (better not limit
it). One day, after getting only 5 platefuls,
“Silly Suffolk” grumbled at the “short com-
mons.” An argument arose as to how many plate-
fuls he could eat, and he “ went brag.” “ I’ll bet
a note,” said Luke, the pole-dragger, “ that you
don’t eat 12 platefuls, flush and hot, and drink 6
pannikins (pints) of tea, all at one meal. ’ “A
note !” said “ Silly Suffolk,” scornfully. “What’s
a note? What’s 12 platefuls? What’s 6 pints of
tea? Not a peck and a sip for an infant!
Look here. You give me Sunday, so’s I don’t
have to yacker afterwards, and I’ll eat 20 platefuls
and drink 10 pints of tea, and get a real satisfier
for once. And I bet you a note all round _

"A MODERN BUCCANEER .”
LOUIS BECKE, author of “By Reef and Palm”
overseer —“ if you like, that I don’t cry a breath,
and I mustn’t be jewed out of my hard tack after-
wards, if I’m hungry, mind you.” Well, it was a
wager. Sunday came, and the camp s whole
boilerful of porridge was set before ‘ Silly
Suffolk,” with a gallon and a half of tea ready to
hand. The platefuls were not actually ladled out,
because everybody was satisfied that the full
quantity wagered was there. The camp stood,
sat and lounged around to watch the glutton feed.
That acclimatised ex-yokel from “ Silly Suffolk
swallowed the blistering porridge, drank the
steaming tea, polished off some ant-scented dried
horse-beef and bread, and called for_ more tea!
Then he pocketed the notes and said, I think
I’ll just do some washing and then have a camp.
I don’t care about any shooting to-day. Rouse

It’s a poor rule that won’t work all round.
If N.S.W. Govt, can afford to stipulate for a
minimum wage for the men it employs, it ought
to be able to do as much for the women—who, at
all times, earn less and are less able to fight for
themselves. Would Premier Reid dare to turn a
deaf ear to the women’s appeal if the women had
votes ?

The latest Queen’s speech gave a shock to
the Nonconformist conscience by substituting the
term “Providence” for “Almighty God.” It
had been the custom for ages to invoke a supreme
personal blessing upon the labours of Parliament.
This time they got merely the blessing of Pro-
vidence, and the religious world is expecting a
Un de sihcle Guy Fawkes to blow the Senate into
smithereens.
In India, when a native is seen coming
out of a grog-shop, his friends simply remark, “ he
has become a Christian.” They don’t spot the
Christianised native by his morality, his char-
itableness, his honesty, or anything of that sort;
they only know him by his breath when he comes
out of the hotel.
The right-thinking William Affleck, M.P.
(N.S.W.), is praying for the regeneration of the
telephone. Some rascals got the Central Exchange,
the other day, to switch on to Parliament House,
Sydney, and then called for Affieck. “I’m the
editor of the Daily Stutterer. I see that you
have several Bills before the House. I was think-
ing of sending a special reporter to interview you
with respect to the scope of your various pro-
posed reforms, and to hear your views on things
generally.” “Most happy, I’m sure.” “Well,
it’s a matter of time and convenience. Now, if
he could become your guest, say, from Friday till
Tuesday morning?” “I shall be glad to
extend hospitality to him.” “All right. Call
round to the office and pick up Mr. Splitquill and
keep him safely for three days.” Of course it was
all flam.
Perhaps the most pertinent query of all
the host which have followed the recent Sydney
spook-eruption is “ What do spooks live on ?” If
they can eat chocolate-creams they must have at
stomach to put them in, and then what else do.
they put in their stomachs when chocolate-creams,
are “off?” This question, however, was answered!
once and for all in the heyday of spiritualism 40>
years ago—when spirits first, at Home’s command,,
arose from out the azure main. Spooks cannot,
carry weight through the blue ethereal, and their
sole sustenance, apart from casual confectionery,,
is that subtly invigorating compound, the essence,
of good spirits, Marshall’s Tonic Nervine. Soldi

Mr. Louis Becke’s South Sea stories,
collected under the title “By Reef and
Palm” in Fisher Unwin’s “Autonym
Library,” charm at once by their freshness
and reality. Mr. Becke’s mind is steeped
in the atmosphere of the Islands; he is a
keen and sympathetic observer, and has
the vivid imagination which enables a
writer to identify himself with the people
he describes; and his characters are conse-
quently no puppets begotten of hasty
scrutiny or literary preconceptions, but men
and women warm with the breath of life.
“What we want,” says John Burroughs,
the American naturalist-essayist, “is a
race of writers who affiliate with their sub-
jects and enter into them through their
blood, their sexuality, and manliness, instead
of standing apart and criticising them and
writing about them through mere intel-
lectual cleverness and ‘smartness.’” Of
that race Mr. Becke is an authentic ex-
emplar. His book is a book of primal
instincts. In the South Seas, Hunger andi
Love have not yet been subtilised into,

of food is still the customary mark of.
esteem : the Samoan salutation —Talofa !
means literally “My love to you!” Mr..
Becke’s natural style of narration, adornedi
only by the poetic imagery of the Islands,,
is well suited to his themes; and it i&
noticeable that when he beats out his grain,
of gold, as in “ The Chilian Bluejacket,”’
he to some extent misses his effect. But.
his book, as a whole, shines with up icity,
, than which language has nothing stronger ;
and with truth, than which literature can
express nothing higher.
“ Oh ! that perpetual Law and Order ! I
often think it is that which does all the mischief

OF ONE.
This cup of life is honey in the mouth
Of him, in whom the hate of wrong is small
To him in whom that hate is strong as drouth.
The draught is bitter and the dregs are gall.
I knew of one who had not wealth nor fame —
Of one who loved to do good things unseen ;
I knew of one, but will not write his name,
Who did not know how great he might have
been.
Flung out beyond himself, at times he’d feel
A strength to stir the great world’s sluggish
brain,
To grind its rankling wrongs beneath his heel
In merciless exultance. But again
Flung back upon himself, he heard the days
With sullen murmurs on the black nights beat;
He heard the weeping of the world’s bye ways,
And felt the gall and wormwood of defeat.
He was a man who waged a ceaseless fight
With all injustice, in untiring zest;
A man who, when his day turned into night.
Said this with truth: “ I gave the world my
best! ”

THE MELBOURNE CUP .
CARNAGE I
I’ll pin my faith to Carnage ! If they bring him*
bright and fit
To the starting-post next Tuesday he shall bear
my little bit;
His price may not be tempting, and another horse
may win.
But I’ll have a decent reason why I “ did the
dollars in,”
Go, and back your rough outsiders; yea, remind
me, with an oath,
That we ought to learn a lesson from Tarcoolaand
Glenloth.
Go, and dump your own spondulix on some
“ handy-weighted ” nag,
And chew reflections bitter when yoursugar’s “in
the bag.”
Perhaps you fancy Patron, who will carry tons of
stuff;
No doubt he is a good ’un, but he’s hardly stout
enough.
Then there’s Ruenalf, his brother, “fairly chuok’t
in,” I’ll agree ”
He may ruin Alfs. by dozens, but he’ll never ruin
me.
Tim Swiveller lasts longer than a lot of them, and
yet
I’ll try to find a better whgn I want to ma'.e a bet.
As for Hova he’ll go h’under ore the whips begin
to crack,
And I wouldn’t follow Bruin with an angel on his
back.
A dandy horse is Loyalty, and clever at the game,
But writers for Thb Bulletin are dead ag’in his
name
(So the bard, of course, is giving an involuntary
wince
When he thinks of Royal Master and remembers
Sailor Prince).
Young Chesterman’s a stayer, on his form, and to
the eye;
One breathes the name of Dreamland with a fond
poetic sigh;
The winner of the Derby will do bravely in the
fight,
And Nightingale makes music in the bookies’ ears
at night.
I’ve much respect for Paris, though his stamina I
doubt,
For he comes up like a flower when the weeds are
dying out;
Still more respect for Devon, who should struggle
for a place,
Whilst Moscow may be burning at the finish of
the race.
There’s pluck that never faileth in the Lady Tren-
ton blood ;
Of Ronda I’ll grow fonder if they gallnp through
the mud ;
But no blood has more virtue than the Carbine
strain of gore,
And I mean to yell for Carnage till the Melbourne
Cup is o’er.
Methinks I see him leading by the distance called
“ a street ”
A-romping home with haloes roun dhis wond’rous
flying feet,
’Midst curses from the Hebrews and hosannahs
from the throng,
And chuckles from the creatures who had “ said
so all along.”
I’ll pin my faith to Carnage if they get him fit
and bright—
When the wrong ’uns try to block him, may the
Lord defend the right!
He’s a beauty, with a record, he’s the one that
ought to win,
And I’ll vow he can't he beaten till I’ve “ done
those dollars in.”
EDMUND FISHER.
SPORTING NOTIONS.
Acceptances for Melb. Cup will not be declared
flntil The Bulletin is just about going to press. This
sermon deals only with horses that seem likely starters,
and possible winners, at time of writing, and the preacher
reserves his right of ignorance concerning accidents
that may happen, trials that may alter previous arrange-
ments, and other unexpected things certain to occur
during eight days of waiting for the result. He will try
to judge “information” by the evidence of his own
eyesight, and vice versa, whilst preserving a reasonable
faith in the book. Public “form” in horse-racing is
always getting upset, but track form is less reliable, see-
ing that it is oftener intended to deceive the public.
Probably 20 owners will think they have a great chance
of winning the Cup. Fifteen of them will be enthusiastic
on the subject, and will advise their friends to have a
bit on. Consequently, the average punter, who believes
in one particular horse because he happens to have “ got
it straight from the stable,” doesn’t know any more than
either of 14 other believers who have each had something
else “given to them,” equally “straight."
Carnage was a brilliant horse last Nov. His
V.R.O. Derby time has never been beaten and only tw-ice
equalled. He made all the running in the Cup, a remark-
able feat for a three-year-old, and finished second. Two
days later he beat Patron and Sailor Prince (for the third
time within the week) overTJ miles. That was the last
seen of the real Carnage during ’93. When he reappeared
it Flemington, and again at Randwick, in the autumn, the
horse was light and fretful, and, more or less, off his
lucker. Carnage ran for Caulfield Stakes the other Satur-
day. He was big and jolly, yet no more unripe than
when he finished nowhete in the Caulfield Guineas, on
)he same day last year. A splendid - looking fellow
who couldn’t possibly get overdone before the Cup
recurs, and who gnawed the grass in the weighing-
rnclosure after his gallop, as though his liver were
active and his temper serene. The trainer has done
his best to make Carnage os he was a twelvemonth ago,
in the matter of condition. He looks a full year
rider and stronger, his people reckon him a tip topper,
and although there are no horses in the stable capable of
giving the crack a great trial, they have youngsters fast
enough to prove his speed. If Carnage does well between
now and next Tuesday he will start a warm favorite. No
mortal prophet can show cause why Patron, Loyalty, or
any other ho se that finished behind him in 1893 Cup
should reve. s (heir positions this time. Carnage card Si
9st. 21bs., and he doesn’t need to be as good a horse as his
close relative. Carbine, to win the race easily.
Neither Patron nor Loyalty has solid preten-
sions to take down Carnage, whose second to Tarcoola
made him out to be a better stayer. When Patron won a
two-mile race, the Canterbury Plate, from Loyalty, they
both “ waited ” the first mile, after which Patron gave
his rival the slip. Patron’s V.R.O. Leger was a slow race.
He was then in the pink of condition, but he couldn’t live
with Portsea at the end of the champion course five days
later. Loyalty, also a questionable stayer, may be pre-
ferred to Patron, though not with much ardour. The
Sailor Prince, delivered at the post in his last year’s
Derby form, would look more tempting than either of
them, for the Prince has only Bst. 51bs. to carry, and his
indifferent performances in the autumn were explained by
his “ off ” appearance. Talking of last year’s champion
race, no one who saw r Hova stagger home in the rear on
that occasion would take 100 to 1 about his Cup chance.
Paris has ever run like a brilliant semi-stayer,
and Tarcoola, although wound up to do a great feat last
November, has been running down ever since. Cripps
backed him at Caulfield t’other day, but he shaped very
moderately. Among the veteran performers weighted
above 7st. 121 b. Newman and Nightingale look most dan-
gerous, and of the two Newman may make the best show.
But it is nothing in Newman’s favor that the people who
backed him so heavily for the ’93 Cup were glad to get
rid of him afterwards.
Devon, at 7st. 121 b., ought to beat all the Caul-
field Cup horses, not even excepting Tim Swiveller. Tim
has never yet stayed two miles in fast company, nor does
he look quite good enough for the task. There is much
talk about the difference which a strong rider makes to
ihis big, swerving, ex-hurdie raeer. He had Tom
■Saunders on his back for the Veteran Stakes at Fleming-
Lon (weight Bst. libs.) and Thomas rode him for all he was
worth. The result didn’t lead one to suppose that Tim
can win the Cup at 7st. lOlbs. Ronda has a “leg,” and
last year’s experience of Penance, another dickey one
from the same stable, gives no encouragement to back the
horse that split Glen loth and Penance in the famous
quagmire race, two years back.
Ruenalf is the pick of the handicap, presuming
he can gallop the distance in Cup time. His recent per-
formances (and there is no earlier form to fall back upon)
don’t show that he can. In a negative sense, they suggest
speed without much stamina. Ruenalf divided Brock-
leigh and Paris in a 1J mile race, weight for age, at
Randwick, and later he ran away from Escapade and others.
With Bst. 41bs. up he ran 1J miles in exactly the
same time that Carnage took last year, when, as
a young three-year-old, he carried 9st. 61b. Ruenalf is
speedy, but not a steam-engine, on public form. His
Staying powers were certainly not tested by Brockleigh
and Paris, and the fact that he is Patron’s brother doesn’t
impress the present writer very deeply. His scratching
for the Caulfield Cup was a bit of business of the kind
often associated with horses which are being worked on a
swollen reputation. For one reason and another the idea
that Ruenalf is a “ moral ” for the Cup appears absurd to
this scribe. He may win “in a walk”; on the other
hand, he is likely to prove a flat-catcher, like Algerian, of
old. Should Dreamland win the Derby, he must go near
to winning the Cup, whereas no other three-year-
old, _ weighted at more than 7st., looks equal to
playing a big part in the two-mile race. Ohester-
man, with 6st. 81bs. to carry, may get into the
first three, but surely Devon can give 181bs. to a little
one like Chesterman, at this time of year. Dreamland’s
Cup chance has to be shown on Saturday, The writer
would prefer the handsome Ballarat horse, as a Derby
winner, to every gee in the Cup, with the exception
of Carnage. So this “tip” amounts to Carnage first,
anyway, with Devon second or third, according to how
the Blue Ribbon is presented.
A belief that Mentor’s half-brother will win
the Derby was expressed in these notes a fortnight back,
and it seems good enough to stand by. The writer fancies
Dreamland, The Harvester, Marusa and Forward, and has
very little faith in Moorite. One public idol, in Paris, has
already carried off the Caulfield Cup. The thought of
getting the popular Dreamland and Carnage “double"
on the top of that seems rather too joyful for realisation,
but it is a very likely combination, nevertheless. Sup-
posing that Dreamland wins on Saturday, both he and
Carnage will require careful guarding, for a number of
professional gents might wish they could engage the ser-
vices of Mrs. Needle, deceased, for “ nobbling ” purposes.

three." Six picks! The most cautious Hebrew that
carries a bag would have laid him 250 to 1 against the

Dear Bulletin, —I don’t like Ruenalf for Melb.

own running all the way to win. Fully 10 per cent, of the
horses that start in an average Cup are merely book-
makers’ “ milkers.” Their entrance-money and all pay-
ments have been made by ringmen, and they are simply
kept in the race to knock the favourite about in the first
mile.—Yours, Booklet’s Chance.

have stances at the stables before the various race-meet-

coincided with the stable fancies, and never came off, as
unhappily his aberration came just in the middle of a
run of bad luck which had struck the stable. Losses
caused by following spook tips made him and his follow-

own unaided judgment. Subsequently he married a

Reconstruction was a befooling of the many for the
of the few—a profitless postponement of the day
i-poknning. So far as concerns these two or three
the worst that could happen to share-
holders is happening now. They are paying their calls
without hope of seeing their money evermore, and the
Iv.om.ht of liquidation has no terrors for them. Deposits
inverted into preference shares have already been

The Victorian reconstructed banks which want
to arrange for a reduction of interest on deposits from
a to 3 per cent., and for 25 years or so in which to pay
** are still hesitating about making a definite proposal
to their creditors. It is difficult indeed to decide how to
frame such a proposal. There is no extra security to
tender in return for the tremendous concession demanded.
and no advantage of any kind to offer in exchange. The
on lv thing that can be said, in fact, is; “ You must
consent to accept this composition or we will burst,'*
arid the great mass of the creditors don t oare in the
least whether the banks burst or not. They only want
from toe Tms’t bank Mill
e-oing they will probably let them slide. Also, if they
think thev oan get even nearly as good a div., they may
do the same, partly out of aggravation, and partly to end
the agony. .....

distribution among themselves of a proportion—possibly
as much as half—of the capital in the form of paid-up
shares. No one knows what a 3 per cent depositor may
not he.capable ®f. In any of these eases the shareholders
wo.nld lose heavily, but as the only visible alternative
would be the aforementioned burst—in which case they
would lose everything—it is difficult to see how they
could refuse.
. . _ . . , ,
The only system which promises to effectually
meet the emergency is for the Vic. Government to give
the depositors 3 per cent, debentures—since 3 per cent, is
to be the order, of the day—for their deposits, to charge
the banks 3J per cent, and put the odd 4 per cent, to a
sinking-fund to cover losses, and then to boss the guaran-
teed institutions, until their obligations are met, under a
rrigime of reduced divs. —or, if needful, no dividends at
all-hard economy, and uo more British deposits. With a
fierce, red-headed Scotch autocrat at the head of each
institution such a device should answer reasonably well,
and the Government security would'be a fair equivalent
for the reduced interest and would make the'transaction
a little less like baM-and naked repudiation.
If the Australian banks get a reduction of in-
terest to 3 per cent., where will the unfortunate B.N.Z.
come in with its £2,000,000 raised on State guarantee at
4 per cent. ? There is no possibility of reducing interest
there. The new liability has a ten years’ currency, and
during,that ten years the Maoriland institution will have
a pleasant time running against the 3 per cent, establish-
ments. The awful folly of paying 4 per cent, for British
money when money could have been obtained either in
Britain or AustraKa.fer 3J will weigh down the B.N.Z. tor
many years to come.

The Colonial Bank of Australasia reports a net
profit for the half-year of £2246, as against £7900 for the
previous six months. This means a profit of about 11/9
per cent, per annum on the paid-up capital, and, there-
fore, it would be nearly five times more profitable if the
Colonial could get out of the banking business altogether
and invest its funds in British consols at 2| per cent! The
falling-off in the half-year is so alarming that the chances
of the Colonial having any profit at all to show in next
balance-sheet seem to be infinitesimal. There is no div.,
and the happy preference shareholder, therefore, drops
into the same gulf as the ordinary one. Last half-year
the Colonial wrote off £50,000 of the old reserve fund to
provide tor possible losses and bad debts, and this
half-year it appears that the amount has all been
absorbed. Therefore, it would seem to the unpro-
fessional observer that in the 12 months the new
Colonial has made not quite £ll,OOO on one hand, and
has lost £50,000 out of the assets of the old Colonial on
the other, and, so far as the net results to the shareholders
are concerned, the effect looks like a dead loss of £39,000.
The bank has £120,000 less coin on hand than it had last
half-year, and, in proportion to liabilities, it has by far the
smallest cash reserve among the 12 banks doing business
in Victoria. Government debentures—a liquid asset
which is practically as good as coin—have diminished
from £5OOO to £1000; and, despite the continued fall in
property values, the item, “ bank premises ” stands at a
slightly higher figure than in the boom days. Altogether
there is not one cheering feature in the whole despondent
document, and in almost every single item it is worse than
its predecessor. Apparently it is high time tor the
Colonial to re-reconstruct.

The unpleasant awakening which comes of being
placed on a “ B” list of contributories arrived, the other
day, to over 100 persons formerly connected with the
Caledonian Land Bank, Melbourne. Five years ago the
Caledopian was in a woefully bad way, and a lot of dis-
satisfied who wanted to get out at any cost,
threatened to make things unpleasant in various ways.
Then a director offered to take all thei.r shares in one lot,
they transferred them to”him and were content. The.
director, hoover, never registered himself as the owner,
ahd when the inevitable smash came that lot of foolish
Shareholders fgutyi themselves just as much liable
for calls as if there had never been any transfer. This
little scheme worked in three different ways. It deprived
the malcontents of any chance to inquire into the doings
of the bank, or into the overdrafts of the directors, or to
audib the accounts, or otherwise to make themselves
troublesome. It placed the “ buyer ” in a position to
annex the dividends on the transferred shares if there
ever were any. And it also placed him in a position to
avoid the calls, if there were any. Moral: The man who
makes a transfer without making dead sure that his
name is taken off the register is an ass, and the law
which fails to enact, under a heavy penalty, that every
transfer must be registered within a very brief period is a
swindle.

itself unable to find profitable investments for its money,
and which wants to reduce interest on deposits because it
!s practically impossible to earn the required 4J per cent.,
offers 5 per cent, interest on all calls paid in advance. A
concern which can hardly earn 4J per cent, and yet offers
5 in order to hurry in the cash is a weird anomaly. The
same bank admits that no allowance for depreciation has
been made on its £lOO,OOO worth of land and buildings,
while the cost of repairs had been added to the valuation
--which valuation may be on the same basis now as it was
at the top of the boom. These are pleasant things for
shareholders to reflect upon.

-the National Bank has nearly *1,600,000 of
available cash and close on £600,000 in Govt, debentures,
In other words, it has got the whole of its un-reconstrueted
deposits on hand for the board to gloat over. The craving
lor huge cash balances is very bad nowadays, just when
the bulk of the liabilities have been so fixed that these
huge balances are altogether unnecessary, and the
National has got the complaint in an aggravated
f°vm. With such a sum on hand it could _ easily
release the batch of 44 per cent, deposits due in ’9B,
and thus make a considerable saving in interest. Such a
proceeding would probably reduce the immense coin
reserve which does so much to make the board “feel
ffC9 d ad over, but if it could tear itself away from part
°r ds ‘ )! Sf stock of gold, it would probably be better in the
end for the shareholders. It is further noticeable that the
auditors’ certificate at the foot of the balance-sheet is
somewhat more definite than many such things that crop
up nowadays, and is apparently written by men who are
J 1 scared lest they should have to explain the document
later on before judge and jury.
If the weaker banks get a reduction of deposit
interest to 3 per cent, and an extension of time, their
receipts will be worth some 9s. or 10s. in the £ on
’Change. Then when they get a little money together,
and begin buying up a lot of their own paper at this
figure, what a profit there will be ! By the way, although
a lot has been said about getting the depositor to reduce
his interest by about one-third because times are bad, and
to fix himself for 20 years or so at that rate, there is no
suggestion as yet about any scheme for raising interest
again if times improve. There might be another howling
boom in a few years, and the 3 or 3J per cent, money
might be lent out at 10 per cent., but the depositor is
apparently to remain “fixed ” just the same.

Re sundry remarks on insurance matters in this
column of last week’s Issue, the Mutual Life Association
of Australasia explains that it never, under any circum-
stances, adds arrears of interest to the capital sum of the
mortgages as shown in its balance-sheet, and (hat out of
the £14,046 which appeared in last balance as “Accrued
Rents and Interest,” only £4030 was overdue. Also, of
this small amount, more than £3500 has since been paid.
These figures show that the Society’s investments must
be remarkably sound. The Mutual Life Association also
promises that, in future, arrears of interest, and interest
accrued but not vet due, shall be kept separate in its
statement of accounts, so that its position will be apparent
to every one. The Bulletin will now be glad to hear
in a similar strain from the other offices alluded to. If
they can all demonstrate that they never add unpaid
interest to the total amount of the mortgage, then this
paper must get back regretfully to its former idea that
the one office which has so enormous an amount of out-
standing interest as compared with its competitors has a
worse collection of investments than the average—unless,
indeed, it has so much better a collection than the
average that it can afford to let interest go in arrear for
long periods without any fear of being ultimately unable
to realise. Meanwhile, this paper would very much like
to hear from these other offices which haven’t yet stated
openly whether they capitalise overdue interest or riot.
* * ♦ •
It is generally understood that the National, and
probably the Victoria, will stand out of the impending
movement to obtain a reduction of interest on deposits ;
but the common impression is that the “ three C’s ”
City, Colonial, and Commercial of Australia—will all be
in it.
* « * *
If the banks with the very much “ fixed ”
deposits had sufficient faith in each other to take each
other’s deposit receipts in payment of overdrafts, and
hold a periodical settlement among themselves, a lot

The reconstrueted St. Joseph’s Investment and
Building Society (Sydney) has made £4640 profit on its
ordinary business during the year, and has devoted the
whole of it to writing down the value of its investments.
If this process is steadily continued St. Joseph will
eventually boom again, but there is probably a few years’
hard work still before him.

The winding-up charges of that historic trade-
assignee are not within 000-ee of certain Southern
liquidators’ charges. It is common knowledge that
liquidators’ charges, over a well-known society, amounted
to close on £13,000, whilst the total amount recovered
did not reach £lO,OOO. the liquidators were working the

The expected Vic. wheat surplus, unless prices
Improve, will most likely end in the screwing up of a
number of big country storekeepers, who are being
heavily supported by certain city houses. Algo, the big
advances against the wheat crop at the beginning of
the year will prove the hottest knock grain speculators
have had for many years.

Enquiries in high places regarding those Sydney

Melb. hotel trade has fallen upon evil days.
Hardly any of the houses which rely on the sale of liquor
alone are paying expenses; and probably two-thirds of
the whole of the hotels are either in the hands of the
brewers or of financial institutions. In the case of
the latter, the landlords are changed about four times a
year. The big residential hotels have managed to hold
their own pretty well during the winter and are hoping
for a big coup during Cup week.

Cabled from London that “ the Colonial Butter
Committee has fixed the price of the finest sorts at 105 s.
per cwt., and other descriptions at 90s. to 945.” That,
deducting freight and charges, will give a return to pro-
ducers of 81s. to 965. nett, or 8 5-7 d. to IOJd. per lb.
Butter is retailed in Sydney at 9d. to lid., so the export
trade barely serves to relieve the glut in the market.

English wheat, 17s. 7d. per quarter — that is,

the idea of “feeding the starving millions,” and try some-
thing else—feeding ourselves, for instance.

It is reported as probable that the so-called
Wealth of Nations will be floated in London for something
like three-quarters of a million. If so, the shareholders
will receive a shock unprecedented in the history of gold-
mining. Now, let these words be remembered.
• • * ♦
Cabled that “Lord Fingal has arrived in Lon-
don, and placed Big Ben and the other splendid London-
derry specimens on view, that intense excitement pre-
vailed, and that the traffic was blocked in the street by
the enormous crowd.” It is easy to believe that London,
having already met the Coolgardie boom more than half-
way, will now go fairly gold-silly for a month or two. It
will be interesting to see how much Fingal and Co. will
ask for their mine.
• • « *
The locality of the Empress of Coolgardie, lately
announced as floated in London, is one of the conun-
drums of that field. It has a capital of £90,000, £75,000
of which, in cash and shares, is supposed to have been
taken by the vendors, leaving £15,000 as working capital.
Perhaps it’s a mine ’locally known under another name.

“Barker and C 0.,” described as Australian
mining and investment brokers of London, take half-a-
page of the Financial News to advertise a dime-novel
gold romance and “ A Story of the Finding of Bayley’s,”
with what object is left unreported. However, here is
the milk of the coooanut: “Being in direct cable com-
munication with West Australia we are in a position to
offer the shares at 235. net cum div.” Quite so. Whose
shares, and how many, and what commission for such
costly ads. ?
* • • •
From Coolgardie comes news of the alleged
finding of the Londonderry line of reef, with rich speci-
mens, two miles further north.
* * * •
Day Dawn, 200 tons for 90oz. gold—less than
half an oz. Not good enough for a country where timber
is scarce, wages high, and everything dear.
• • * *
Assistant Govt. Geologist Goezell has completed
his inspection of the country between Coolgardie and the
Murchison. He says the reefs are very much alike, per-
manent, he thinks, in both fields. The latter the more
developed because of the presence of water. He advises
the erection of enormous central crushing works on each
field, and protests against money being frittered away in
small plants on small mines.
* * * «
Coolgardie is far ahead of other Westralian
fields in the gold output for Sept, quarter—viz.,
45,2020 z., against 11,4710 z. from the Murchison. Some-
what surprising, after reading of the great and numerous
crushings on the latter field, and remembering that the
whole of the stone crushed throughout Coolgardie would
not more than keep one 20-head battery constantly em-
ployed.
* • * •
The report of the new reef-find in Dundas dis-
trict (Norseman’s) makes it out a beauty, traceable for
miles, and gold showing everywhere throughout; it is
5 to Bft. wide, and estimated at as many oz. per ton.
And it was wanted. The official gold-return from
Dundas for last quarter was 400 z., and for the preceding
quarter only 48oz. Up to date, Dundas is all talk.
♦ * * *
The Great Coolgardie G.M. Co.’s prospectus
fills half a page of the Financial News. “ The vendors
have fixed the price to he paid for the land and all mining
rights at £70,000, of which they stipulate that £28,000
shall be paid to them in fully-paid-up shares of the Co.,
£20,000 in cash and £22,000 in cash or shares at the
option of the directors.” And for what are they receiving
this modest pittance? Twelve acres known as Block 400,
said to be on a direct line half-a-mile north of Bayley’s
Reward. Has anybody ever heard of it as a promising
property ? The indetiniteness of Mr. Begelhole’s report
is charming.
« * * *
Compare the prospectus of the Golden Bar Co.,
Gympie, issued locally, with those of Coolgardie mines
issued in London, and the public get some idea of the
difference between legitimate mining investment and the
greed and gamble of a boom when the London under-
writing-and-promoting shark opens his jaw.
« ♦ • •
“Exemptions,” writes a Bulletin correspon-
dent from Coolgardie, “ are again being applied for. One
or two have been granted, and it is feared these are only
the forerunners of many similar applications. The strike
at Hannan’s for 10s. a week increase all round in lieu of
water-supply ended in a failure. One co. (Great Boulder)
imported 50 men from ‘ t'other side.’ Wages are now
lower than formerly, being £3 10s. per week for miners
without water. Wherever possible the companies are
employing fresh hands.
“ There are many good things in the I. O.IT. and
White Feather districts undreamt of in Coolgardie proper.
M'Auliffe’s (lately floated), at the White Feather, is said
by a reliable witness to be extremely rich and a splendid
show. Dick Egan, finder of the Croesus, at Hannan’s, has
fallen on his feet again, having secured a good claim at
the Feather, three-quarters of a mile from M'Auliffe’s, on
the same line.
“ Investors would do well to fight shy of any of
Brockman’s companies at Hannan’s, viz.—Gt. Boulder,
Lake View, Iron Duke, &c. The only fair one in his
crowd is, in my opinion, the Ivanhoe, and it does not
make a fourth-rate show among the average good ones in
the district.
“ The manager of the Boulder gets -£lOOO a
year ; a couple of men under him £4OO a year, and a crowd
of miners £3 10s. per week. When you read such items
as the “Boulder crushed 80 tons for 3000 z.,” &c., please
receive them cautiously.
“ The Mt. Burgess G.M. Go., Coolgardie, ought
to appear on the div.-lisi after the battery in course of
erection has a fair trial. The Adelaide, Coolgardie, has
any amount of stone but not a visible colour.
“ The Seek and Find (MacPherson’s), Oool-
gardie, is worth keeping a favorable eye upon. Many
alluvial men at the lOU are making a good thing. The
threatened water-famine of a couple of weeks ago is not
likely to be again feared, as a big supply of salt water has
been struck at the Cattle Swamp, Mt. Burgess. Water is
sd. and fid. per gal. in Coolgardie.”—Coolgardie, Oct. 9, ’94.
* ♦ * •
At last! Westralian Government is about to
bore 3000 ft. for artesian water at Coolgardie.

The most persistently-advertised mine on earth
is Cosgrove’s. They are always breaking rich stone, but
the shares somehow don’t gee correspondingly.

Zeb Lane, his satchel filled with English bank-
notes, departs immediately for the Westralian El Dorado,
says The Bulletin’s London correspondent. His place il
taken by Begelhole, who is much sought after, and whosi
name apnears to be sufficient to float a sunken ironclad.
Zeb. is to be banqueted before his departure, and lh«
A.-G. for Westralia, Malcolm Fraser, is to take the chair.
But I don’t think North will be there, for he has had tl
take up nearly all the shares in the Big Boulder, w'hich hj
underwrote. By-and-bye, no doubt, if Zeb. should return
to Hingland, he will get a most sensational welcome.

Some Sydney speculators could, a little while
ago, have bought Mt. Drysdale (N.S.W.)mine for £12,000;
now the shareholders turn up their noses at a conditional
offer of £200,000 for that bright and shining property.
“ At the 130 ft. level the miners are taking out a body of
stone about 10ft. thick, every particle of which is sent to
the mill. The stuff goes from lOoz. to 30oz. of gold to
the ton, and if the stone was picked it would go lOOoz.”
It is estimated that there is at present at the mill £20,000
worth of gold, which, with that in hand, would pay a div.
of £l7O per share.
* • • *
The jointly-subsidised east crosscut from tha
1330 ft. level of the Extended (Broken Hill) shaft has been
stopped. The crosscut was a plucky prospecting work
projected by the Central, Block 10, and Extended Co.’s,
with Govt, (prospecting grant) aid, to test the lode at a
depth equivalent to 1400 ft. below the central outcrop.
One ore body, 30ft. wide, of worthless sulphide was passed
through, and though the crosscut has been carried nearly
300 ft. beyond that—s4oft. altogether—nothing more was
found. The body passed through was probably the
western limb of the lode. The result of the work dis-
poses, so far, of the theory of improvement of the sul-
phides at depth.

Mount Morgan gold-mine has returned to its
shareholders since ’B6, 3J millions in divs.—£3 10s. per
share. Total working expenses tor that time were IJ-
million. Broken Hill Proprietary—the biggest silver-
mine, as Mt. Morgan is the biggest gold-mine- has, since
’B6, paid nearly £5,000,000 divs., and over 1600,000
bonuses; while working expenses have totalled over
£6,500,000. Thus two Australian mines alone—and they
stand alone in the world—have paid £8,500,000 divs. in
eight years.

The Tasmania 54700 z. amalgam from 1175 tons

Dear Bulletin, — The Melb. Mining Exhibition
is a wretched jumble, a nightmare of pocket batteries,
dry-crushers, oil-engines, and alluvial washers, some of
the latter evidently cream-separators laboring under a
misapprehension. The show is very badly laid out and
managed, and visitors have to climb over one set of
machines to get at another, whilst, to the man who has
not less than a month to spare, there is no means of dis-
covering the virtues of any machine. I noticed that the
general tendency was to favor the appliance (hat secured
the best prospect after a trial, quite independent of the
richness of the different materials experimented upon. If
the exhibition was worth giving, surely it was worth
sensible management?—S.S.

All good average, while the St. George breaks its record.

Wellwood mine, Orange, has got colors on the
surface with good indications below. The Wellwood
is Harry Newman’s latest fad. He is trying to pick up
the Lucknow run of country nearer Orange. Po sibly
rich gold will be found on the contact of the serpentine
and diorite formations outside Lucknow field, but the
general absence of alluvial cannot be regarded as en-
couraging.
The Bletchington is another mine with the same
object—to find the Lucknow gold-run. Of it a Sydney
paper says“ Work has been suspended owing to some
difficulty with reference to the freehold, but will be re-
sumed at once. The mine recently gave some rich
returns.” Now, so far as The Bulletin can learn, the
mine never had anything rich to crush.
* * * *
Another start is to be made at Rivertree silver-
mine, N.S.W. It never paid when silver was up, and
great must be the faith of those who expect to make it
pay now with the metal at less than two-thirds the former
price.

Nervous sufferers will find it worth their
while to peruse Herr Rassmussen’s advt. on page
19 of this issue.
Ed. Bulletin, — It is doubtful whether
the Australian protection extended to the laugh-
ing-jackass is not a mistake. It is a serious error
to suppose the goburra confines itself to worms,
reptiles, &c. It is a notorious fact that his
majesty commits great havoc among young birds.
He has been known to attack a nest and destroy
all the inmates. What do our bush naturalists
say to this ?—L.
Premier Nelson’s idea is that Q. squatters
should combine to employ a regular body of
shearers all the year round. Take the province’s
sheep at 20 millions, and allow ICO a day to a man
with machine, then 1000 men in 200 days would
shear the lot. That leaves 165 days for Sundays
and wet weather. Then, says Nelson (the Scotch
instinct showing), the men, having permanent
work, could afford to take less than £1 per 100,
and both sides would be benefited.
Wasted Money.
It is simply wonderful, in an enlightened age like
the present, how people will waste their money on
useless medicines. There are thousands of sufferers
in this country from liver torpidity, indigestion,
kidney complaint and biliousness, who pay half-
crowns for so-called “cures,” when they could get
far better and safer results from half an ounce of
Epsom salts, costing one half-penny. Of course,
we know this chemical will not give permanent
results—neither will any of the many advertised
nostrums—but it will give temporary relief and
not injure the system, whereas the disguised
drastic purging mixtures sold by many quacks
will cause many serious diseases. Clements
Tonic does not cure or relieve disease by purging.
It is a natural tonic restorative, and acts by
stimulating the digestive and secretive apparata
to perform their proper functions. It rebuilds
wasted nerve, bone and muscular tissue, re-
stores strength to the debilitated system,
and ensures a long, happy, and enjoyable
life, as proved by the experience of Mr. Francis
Barnes, Goulburn, N.S.W., who writes on
May 25th, 1893 : —For about the last twelve years
I have been suffering from a derangement of the
kidneys. The symptoms from which I have
suffered were pains across the loins extending up
the spine. In getting up in the morning I felt so
bad that I could hardly lace ray boots, owing to
the severe pains from which I suffered in the back.
Hearing so much about Clements Tonic and the bene-
fit sufferers had derived from it for the above com-
plaint, I gave it a trial, and before I had finished
the tenth bottle, I am happy to say I was entirely
cured. My case is not the only one that has come
under my notice, as some of my relatives and
friends have derived great benefit from Clements
Tonic; I am only too happy to certify to the
above. Yours gratefully, Francis Barnes, Goul-
burn, N.S.W.
THE METHODS OF TRAINING.
TO SCULLERS.
Henry Fisher, of Drummoyne, Sydney, the
well-known amateur sculler, writing on the
various methods employed in training athletes,
observes : —“ To-day we find old and young alike
marvel at the great efficacy of St. Jacobs oil,
which is the one sure cure when rubbed into the
pores of the skin, and briskly covered with a flesh-
glove by the trainer till the skin is aglow. I
expect to find every athlete have as part and
parcel of his training paraphernalia a bottle of St.
Jacobs oil. It is my opinion, gained in my own
training experiences on the track and afloat, in
Queensland, Victoria, and New South Wales,
that St. >):.cobs oil is all that is required, I having
used it vci frequently.”
William Beach, ex-champion sculler of the
world, says:—“ I found St. Jacobs oil of great
service in training. For stiffness, cramps, mus-
cular pains, and soreness it is invaluable.”
Edward Hanlan, another ex-champion sculler,
writes : —“For muscular pains in the limbs I have
found St. Jacobs oil a reliable remedy. Its results
are most beneficial, and I have pleasure in recom-
mending it from personal experience.”

I THOS MUDIMAN, Master Tailor, of 547 George-street, Sydney, in the Colony of
New Soath Wales, do hereby solemnly and sincerely declare as follows
Whereas I suffered severely from a very troub’esome affection of the Nerves which
affected me so much that I was quite unable to at tend to my business. I tried several doctors
and many remedies, but all of no avail. Whereas I, as a last hope, obtained some of Herr
Rassmussen’s Purely Herbal “Alkaline
Vitality Pills,” Which I hereby solemnly and
sincerely declare Completely Cured Me with-
in a few weeks, and although this is over five
years ago I have remained well ever since.
The Alkaline Pills also cured my wife, and
I make this solemn declaration conscientiously
believing the same to be true.

To Herr Rassmussen.
Dear Sir,-I think it my duty to inform you

acted very beneficially on my nervous system,
and, in consequence, I have recommended them
to many friends, who have all been cured by
their use. —Yours, R. A. LUCKHAM.

Dear Sir, —I have much pleasure to inform
you that a course of your Alfaline Pills com-
pletely cured me of a severe case of biliousness,
wind and nervousness. I may also mention
that several of my friends to whom I have
recommended your remedies have derived great
benefit from them; therefore, I consider you
are deserving of success, which I do most
heartily wish you.—Yours gratefully,

the half-year just closed amounting to £57,345 12s sd, as against =£59.958 17s lOd for the previous six
months ; and if the amount tor the past year is placed against the last twelve months of the old Bank’s
existence, the respective amounts would be .£117,303 and 139,073, showing a net reduction of £2l 770
per annum in favor of the later period. ’
The Paid-up Capital has been increased during the period under review by £131,251 11s
now stands at the considerable sum of £1,690,5512s Bd, the payments in advance of calls due
for no less than £91,957 2s of this amount.
During the half-year a branch was opened at Coolgardie, Western Australia, and the offices at
lerang in Victoria, and Crystal Brook, Woodside, Mintaro, Terowie, Truro, Koolunga and Yorke
Town in South Australia, have been closed.

We certify that we have examined the Accounts of the National Bank of Australasia, Limited
for the half-year ending 30th September, 1894, together with the statement of Profit and Loss and the
aggregate Balance-sheet for the same Period (the Assets and Liabilities at the Branches are taken on
the Certificates of the Managers and Accountants), and that in our opinion the Balance-sheet is a full
and fair Balance-sheet, containing the particulars required by the Articles of Association, and properly
drawn up so as to exhibit a true and correct view of the state of the Bank’s affairs.
Certified before me, at Melbourne, this 26th October, 1894.

J. H. YOUNG.
Mrs. Needle, the Richmond poisoner, died
Very game. She refused brandy or any stimu-
lant, spirituous or spiritual, shoving away the
bottle with as much determination as she shoved
the parson. She told the hangman that he needn’t
trouble to strap her up tightly, as she knew that
she would go off slick. “You see,” she said,
“the quietest death in a ease like this is the
quickest.” She had the greatest contempt for her
drop-predecessor, Mrs. Knorr, because that lady
thought it best to meet her doom on the verge of
D.T’s.
The octogenarian William Redfern Watt,
of Bumbaldry, near Grenfell, who died the other
day while on a visit to Sydney, was amongst the
earliest settlers in the Weddin Mountain district.
He went, 62 years ago, to the Lachlan, where now
stands the town of Cowra, then a sheep-station
occupied by his uncle, Dr. Redfern, a colonist of
the Macquarie era. Soon afterwards, he settled
at Bumbaldry as a grazier. He represented Car-
coar in one of the earliest Parliaments ; married
the daughter of John Grant, of Merriganowry,
Lachlan River, the first white man who set foot
on that river at Canowindra.
A Sydney Telegraph correspondent shows
that the administration of justice in N.S.W. is
rapidly being turned into a family affair. “ Out
of the seven Judges, the Chief Justice is the only
one who has no near relative a practising barrister.
Four out of them have sons, one of those four a
son-in-law, a fifth has a nephew and a cousin, and
a sixth a brother. Moreover, another son and
another nephew are imminent.” Threeof the judges
again, are particularly associated with these advo-
cates in special jurisdictions, and it happens that
in each of such courts larger practices are enjoyed
by the relations of the respective judges than by
any other men of equal standing at the bar.
An Apology by Messrs. J, Frossard and
Co. —We have recently made a certain statement
regarding our Cavour Cigars (which are now sold
everywhere at eight for Is.), to which objection
has been taken in certain quarters. We said that,
by buying the Cavour at IJd. each, the smoker
received a cigar equal in quality to the usual 3d.
cigars, which statement we now retract, as since
then the opinion of good judges has led us to the
conclusion that our Cavours are infinitely superior
in quality to any 3d. cigar—in fact, they compare
favorably with many 6d. ones. For mildness,
aroma, and good manufacture, they have never
been approached at their price, and the sudden
and general demand for them is the best proof of
this. We beg, in conclusion, to thank the intel-
ligent public, who, by patronising our Cavours,
have done justice to us and to their own judgment.
— J. Frossard and Co., Payerne, Switzerland.
Wool and Produce Reports.
M'Burnbt, Wallis & Co. report.—As compared with
last season both greasy and scoured wool may be quoted
from Id. to ljd. per pound lower. The wretched state of
trade in England and Europe is chiefly responsible for the
low prices now ruling, and the only consolation we have
is that the London market is no better than our own. The
only course we can advise owners to adopt is to leave the
sale of their wool to their brokers’ judgment and to sell
in Sydney. Nothing is to be gained by holding over, for
the immediate outlook is not at all encouraging. At our
last sale we passed in a large portion of our cata-
logue because owners would hold out for prices
far above market rates, and by so doing we regret to say
some of them have missed a chance, and in the end will
have to sell at reduced prices. It is more important now
than ever it was for growers to put trust in their selling
agent. Among the brands we offered at our last sale
were the following: WR over triangle, from Young;
9B over NAMOI, from Gunnedah ; DKY/WAIT-A-
WHILE, from Dubbo; 3/JE/TIMOR, from Blandford;
HN/MBROOK and PN/MBROOK, from Muswellbrook;
ZZ, from Collie ; EAGLEVALE, from Coolamoon ; BILLA
BULLA/W>, from Warren; GT/F, from Forbes; JW,

lington ; OTH, from Geurie; BC, J/C, D/ROSERUN,

CAMP/CK, from Dubbo; JG/COOLAC, from Coolao;
JA/AP, from Manilla; CH/LACKLAND, from Cowra;

Sydney, Oct. 31, 1894.
That brightest of Australian books, “ A
Golden Shanty,” is now in its second edition, and
will be posted to any Australasian address for
Is. 3d. ; foreign, Is. 6d. It includes some of the
best and most characteristic prose and verse that
has ever appeared in The Bulletin —Banjo’s
“Old Pardon ” and “ Clancy,” Lawson’s “Faces
in the Street,” Farrell’s “Last Bullet,” several of
Daley’s choicest poems, and tales and sketches by
Dyson, Lawson, Titus Salt, and other popular
Bulletin writers. Everybody should own a
copy.
The Apex keyless watch, made at the
Beaucourt factory in France, has entered the
Australian market in earnest, and is advertised at
<£l post free to any address in Australasia —vide
inside back cover of this week’s Bulletin. It is a
stem short-winder, has works equal to those of the
best .£8 silver or .£2O gold watch, is set in an un-
tarnishable case, will stand the roughest usage,
and is altogether the cheapest, most reliable and
best popular watch ever made. The Beaucourt
Watch Co., Box, No. 686, General Post-office,
Sydney, will be glad to receive and publish testi-
monials from Australian buyers.
Under a thin pretence of hero-worship,
the S.M. Herald, which fiercely resents Max
O’Rell’s fleers and jeers at the odious sham saints
of Anglo-Saxondom, publishes a gruesome carica-
ture of that hard-headed, hard-fisted old York-
shire sailor, Captain Cook. The peg is Cook’s
supposed Bible, of which the Herald says:
“ The book shows the man an upright, fearless,
intensely just man, with a deeply religious spirit.”
Cook, no doubt, had a Bible—most people have
had Bibles —and he probably regarded it as a sorb
of fetish—most people regard it as a sort of fetish
—but the fact doesn’t prove anything. Cook was
upright and fearless because it was his nature, and
just about as religious as any other naval officer of
his time (see “Tom Cringle’s Log”). Why he
should be held up to public snuffle as a kind of
marine Pecksniff is one of those things which
only the Herald can understand.

Professor TODD, Anderson’s College Medical

munication on his part to Messrs. Bosisto & Co.,
writes :
It is a lighter, clearer, and more ethereal oil than any
I have hitherto used, besides being free from the heavy
nauseous odour characteristic of others.
This is particularly noticeable when the oil is sprayed
into the throat.
It is very palatable when taken internally, which places
it above other preparations, and considerably enhances its
value.

While the Diamond Bird Sings.
[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
Sing, sweetly sing, oh diamond bird,
For by thy song is memory stirred—
Thou mindest me of one I’ve heard
In summers long ago.
Her voice was very soft and sweet,
Her heart the truest heart that beat—
At least, I thought so then—repeat
Thy strain that moves me so !
The yellow charlock gleams again,
Upspringing through the growing grain ;
Again I seem to see
The face of her I thought complete,
As when in some secure retreat
She pulled the wild flowers at her feet,
And gave them bound to me.
Ah, maiden with the golden hair
And eyes of grey beyond compare,
Do you remember now
Those happy, careless, sunlit days,
By fern-enfolded water-ways,
Where, sheltered from the noon-day blaze,
We cooled hot hands and brow?
There subtle hints of sunlight break
Through overhanging ferns, which take
Such tints from lights unseen,
That times there are, when birds are still
And winds are mute on ridge and hill,
One dreams that flitting fairies fill
This home of gold and green.
The water-fall that leaps the ledge
Shoots shining o’er the moss-grown edge
And loiters long to rest
Among the waving water-weed,
Whose locks entwine the rustling reed—
Ah, those were pleasant days, indeed,
And life was at its best!
•■*•••♦
Though still the falling waters sing
Across the ledge where mosses cling—
Weeds wave and tall reeds fret,
Yet one, at least, will never cool
Hot hands in that sequestered pool,
And one—it surely shows the fool
To nurse a vain regret!

“In the trial of the Weilmoringle (N.S. W.)

was happily found loyal to their oaths.’’ In this
case, the jury brought in theaccused shearersguilty,
and no doubt acted up to their lights in doing so ;
but the Star, by the words quoted, implies that
such an incident is rare, and that other juries per-
jure themselves. In other words, men who bring
accused in guilty are a happy find; men who
don’t are oath-breakers.

. Dr. A. Mueller, of Yackandandah (Vic.),
inventor of the strychnine snakebite cure,
laughs to scorn the much-puffed chloride-of-lime
discovery. Not only is the injection of chloride-
of-hme a very old attempt at remedy, but it is
quite useless after snake-poison has entered the
blood-stream ; its only action being to decompose
chemically the venom and thus to destroy its toxic
properties. Dr. Mueller prefers—as must any
chemist—the more powerful reagent of per-
manganate of potash, but that, too, is useless
after the poison has gone into circulation. The
doctor himself relies on his strychnine injections,
but insists on their discontinuance as soon as
certain unmistakeable local spasms commence in
the muscles, and points proudly to the fact that,
wherever his instructions have been strictly fol-
lowed, there has never been failure.

The Caligraph Writing Machine,
IpQ
THE CALIGRAPH embodies all the highest
developments of applied mechanics, and its
principle having stood the test of 15 years, its
success towers above the fantastic devices of mush-
room competitors.
“ i like Caligraph writing better than that of
any other typewriter because the type comes out
so sharply and clearly.” The prominent Anglican
clergyman, who used these words, had hit upon
the chief characteristic of the Caligraph without
exactly knowing what brought it about. The
result is attributable to the fact that tha platen of
the Caligraph being bevelled the type strike
against a flat surface thus producing a full and
even impression. When you see typewriting with
only the middle of the letters clear you know that
the machine used was not a Caligraph, but one
fitted with the ordinary round platen. When you
read a typewritten letter, with some of the type
leaning to the right and- the rest to the left, you
may be sure that your correspondent has a crude
machine, with curved typebars, which naturally
become more crooked, and thus twist their type
out of perpendicular. Then remember that the
Caligraph has straight typebars which, like every-
thing else in the machine, are fitted with adjust-
able bearings.
The Caligraph manifolds 15 carbon copies at
one operation, and used with the Edison Mimeo-
graph reduplicates 1500 copies from one stencil.

FOUNTAINS IN PLAY.
Who doesn’t enjoy looking at a fountain in play ?
The bright water leaps into the air as though it
were a living, conscious thing. Then at the
summit of its aroh it is shattered into spray by
the wind, or wafted to and fro like the skirts of a
dancing girl. And all the while the roar of its
rush and the tinkling melody of its fall fill the air.
This is water having a good time—water in high
spirits. What makes it jump, sing, and laugh in
that fashion? Wait a bit. If you please, we
will have the explanation later on. Perhaps you
know already ; perhaps not. It isn’t so easy to
know things from the bottom.
Under date of March 16th, 1892, a lady writes
that for twenty years she always felt low-spirited.
Now, what is meant by “ spirits ” in this sense is
a condition of the mind in respect of our being
cheerful, happy, enjoying our surroundings, taking
delight in all sorts of minor matters, and, in a word,
making the most of life ourselves and helping
others to make the most of it. Well then, it is
both a glorious and a profitable thing to be always
in good spirits ; I wish I could be myself.
But I can’t; anyhow, I’m not. Neither is
anybody. Yet why not? What makes our hearts
sink down like a plummet, and then rise like a
cork ?
Before we answer let us read the rest of the
letter. The writer says; “For twenty years I
have suffered from liver complaint and indigestion,
I was constantly tired, weak, and languid. My
skin was a sallow colour, and I had great pain at
the back and shoulders.
“My appetite was poor, I had a bad taste in the
mouth, and much pain and weight at the chest
after eating. I was also frequently sick, throwing
up a sour, frothy fluid. I took different kinds of
medicine, but none of them gave me relief, and I
got weaker and weaker.
“ In March, 1884, I became so bad that I called
a doctor, who attended me off and on for twelve
months. He gave me medicines, but I grew no
better, as nothing he prescribed seemed to reach
my complaint. About this time I heard of Mother
Seigel’s Syrup, and commenced taking it. fn less
than a month all my pain and distress ceased, and
I have since been in good health. I keep a bottle
of the Syrup in the house as a family medicine,
and by taking an occasional dose have needed no
doctor.
“I may mention that my aunt, who lives at
West Wycombe, Bucks, was afflicted with indiges-
tion and dyspepsia. She states that in her opinion
Mother Seigel’s Syrup has been the means of
saving her life. You are at liberty to use this
statement as you may see fit. Yours truly,
(Signed) Mrs. Harriett Cutler, Burton House,
33 Kenmure Road, Hackney, London.”
No philosopher has yet been able to say what
is the exact relation of the mind to the body.
This much, however, experience constantly assures
us of; that it is very intimate, and that the
condition of the mental faculties depends upon
that of the body. As birds sing when the sun
shines, and are dumb in the dark, so the spirits
and mental powers rise and express themselves
when we are in health, and are dull and torpid
when the body is under the weight of pain and
disease. And to know that is to know all we
require to act upon.
Everything, money, influence, and every form
of success depends so largely upon health that by
universal consent we don’t expect good service
from those who are ill.
And illness, nine times in ten, means precisely
what Mrs. Cutler suffered for such a long and
weary period—indigestion and dyspepsia—the
ailment cured (when the doctors are done with
their fruitless experiments) by Mother Seigel’s
Curative Syrup.
The fountains play only when the water is
forced powerfully through their pipes by gravity
or by machinery. So the spirits are free and
elastic only when the organs within us act without
hindrance or obstruction.
REVIEW.
“Webster’ s International Dictionary."
BY WILFRED BLACHER.
Language has a tendency to go ahead of the
dictionaries. It progresses and develops con-
tinually, and although the pedant may resort to
ancient dictionaries in order to discover what the
language used to be, the man who wants to know
what a word now means will be obliged to refer to
a more recent publication. New lexicons must
supplant the old, and, recognising this fact, the
proprietors of “Webster’s Unabridged Dictionary”
have prepared and published a revised and en-
larged edition of their well-known volume.
“Webster’s International Dictionary’’ is the
title of this new, and in every way up-to-date,
edition of the “Webster’s Unabridged Diction-
ary” which was itself “international” in use if
not in name. The new title was fairly earned by
the “Unabridged Dictionary,” but the “Inter-
national ” now submitted is an immense improve-
ment on its predecessor, and is, in fact, as the
publishers announce, a “new book from cover to
cover.” The number of words included has
been very largely increased ; new definitions and
new illustrations have been added, and a com-
plete revision of the whole work effected, with
the result of making this edition as far superior to
the “ Unabridged ” as the latter was to its rivals
at the time of its first publication. The Dictionary
just fails to be an interesting volume for general
reading, but as a standard authority on all matters
relating to the meaning, spelling, or pronunciation
of words, it will secure a higher place and wider
popularity than even its predecessor enjoyed.
Cyclopedic in its store of information, it is also
concise enough for handy use and instant refer-
ence, and the system of insetting initial letters to
indicate the alphabetical and other divisions of
the matter in the book will be found to be of great
time-saving ad vantage. (“Insetting” is, by the
way, an obsolete word, but, like Geordie’s “spook,”
it may be revived.)
The objection to Webster that it is an “Ameri-
can ” dictionary has less of force now than for-
merly, because the differences of spelling anciently
existing have, to a large extent, been reconciled,
and wherever there is still a variance in this
respect the alternative method of spelling is
recorded. The extended meanings given of such
words as “ snap,” “ sand,” “ trash,” and “smoker”
still betray the American origin of the book, but as
some of the distinctly American uses of these
words, and others in like case, have already
obtained a vogue in Australia, the definitions
referred to should have a place in an Australian
dictionary. The objection referred to has obviously
less weight here than in England, and the fact
that Webster has gained a pre-eminent place
there in spite of the prejudice against an Ameri-
can dictionary of the English language is the
strongest proof of the merit of the book.
Besides the dictionary proper, the “Interna-
tional ” contains some very useful parts and
appendices, including, inter alia, a history of the
English language, a guide to pronunciation and
orthography, a gazetteer and biographical dic-
tionary, and a very useful list of words and
phrases quoted from foreign languages—quota-
tions generally described as familiar because they
are not usually understood. Taken right through
from cover to cover, the book leaves little scope for
criticism, and affords ample cause for commenda-
tion. Its merits may be best summed up in the
statement that it is an immense improvement on
the “ Unabridged ” Webster which won its way
and established its popularity in three continents.
To come down to cold commercial details, it may
be mentioned that the price is about one penny
per square yard of page area, and about four
shillings per pound of the weight of the
volume. I have not counted the words included
in the Dictionary, but 200,000 may be near their
total, and remembering that there are so many
words in the language it is a matter for regret
that some of the less thoughtful bullock-drivers of
this fertile land should occasionally, in moments
of irritation, express themselves in terms not con-
tained in Webster, and not sanctioned by use in
refined circles. In calmer moments, and upon
cool reflection, such terms may appear to those
who thus use them to verge upon impropriety,
but the fact remains that the 200,000 authorised
words available for the expression of human
sentiment continually fail to satisfy the require-
ments of a teamster who finds his cattle apathetic
when his waggon is down to the axles in a “glue-
pot.”

language, being the authentic edition of Webster’s no-

Dear Bulletin, —The proprietor of a fine
aboriginal harem had a bad knock lately. He
nourished his favorite gin for six months on
station stores, and the consequence was black as a
coal. The moment the outraged father saw it, out
went the mother with a warning that the dogs
would get her if she dared come near his place
again. All the other local Brighams are in
ecstasies. —Yours, Barringun.

Westminster Gazette lately devoured a Bul-
letin jest and reproduced it in a solemn paragraph.
Touching the fact—which it also obtained from this
journal—that “the crime of embracery has developed so
much in Melbourne,” the Westminster Gazette says :
“Now a very curious rumor comes, which has it that the
principal ‘ jury-squarer ’ there has floated his business
into a limited liability company, and that the shares are
standing at a heavy premium.” The Bulletin printed
the lie in the first instance, without pausing
to consider the awful dullness of the average London
editor. Nevertheless, the W.G. might not have taken it
seriously had the statement not acquired a color of truth
from certain notorious legal incidents in Smellbourne.
Facts relating to that marvellous city are stranger than
fictions. At the present moment Hingland is hearing of
how a Victorian magnate, at the Mercantile Finance Co.
meeting, bellowed : “Some of the other fellows ought to
be *on the roads,’ perhaps—but not me.”
• * * «
* ; A client got a bill of costs after the close of a
suit, the other day, and interviewed his solicitor. His
brief to counsel in the matter happened to be lying,
endorsement upwards, upon the table, and was marked
“ 20 guas.,” whereas the charge on the attorney’s bill was
30. The client asked for time, and tried to get the bill
reduced, and was met with the request to have it settled
at the end of the month. But it was settled immediately—
by the client, a muscular person, suddenly declaring he
would not pay a cent, picking up the brief and departing
in triumph. Gentleman One will take his gruel kindly,
and not move in the matter.

The interesting Ellis Bros, case was, presum-
ably, finally settled by Q. Supreme Court last week. Ellis
Bros, were Q. graziers who went insolvent. They
became entitled to money in England, for which Official-
Assignee Raff applied to the Court of Chancery. On
6th March, 1893, Raff learned that the Court had decided
in his favor, and that money to pay all the creditors in full
would be available. Said Griffith, C.J., in summing-up :
“ Prom the 6th of March, when Mr. Raff heard of the
decision in his favor, to 31st October, he did absolutely
nothing to make known to the creditors their good
fortune.” Messrs. G. and J. Cowlishaw approached the
creditors and offered from 6d. in the £ upwards for
their claims. The result was that on sth May claims
to £l9O were assigned for £2O; on 4th August, £2138
for £200; on Ist September, £63 10s. for £l5; on 21st
September, £l7 6s. 7d. for £1 Is.; and on 26th Septem-
ber, £9B for £27. Raff’s solicitors were Lilley and
Cowlishaw, and, said Griffith, C. J.: “It would be absurd
to affect to ignore the family relationship existing
between the junior member of the firm of solicitors and
the gentlemen who, while Mr. Raff was passive in his
solicitors’ hands, were engaged in buying up the debts in
the estate, and to whose interest it was that the creditors
should not be made aware of the decision in their favor.”
When everything was settled, however, Raff applied for
4J per cent, commission on the debt of £5552, on which
the original creditors lost so heavily, and by which the
Messrs. Cowlishaw profited so largely. The Court gave
him 1 per cent, as “ a sufficient remuneration for all the
work that Mr. Raff has done for the benefit of the creditors
in the estate.” Mr. Raff, by the way, is “the Hon.
Alex. Raff, M.L.0.”

Touching Bishop Oamidge’s statement to a
Yorkshire audience (referred to in a recent issue of The
Bulletin) “that if money were, at the present time,
judiciously invested in real estate he believed in a few
years time, if things went on improving, as was expected,
real estate would be worth four or five times as much,”
The Bulletin has ascertained some sad facts re Bishop
Oaraidge’s connection with Sydney real estate which are
here set down for the information of that Yorkshire
audience and the general public :
1. That Bishop Camidge holds 2000 £5 shares in the
Sydney Real Estate Bank, Limited, a huge land-boom
concern, which took over a number of the “ judicious”
purchases of a well-known boomer.
2. That there has been paid on these shares the sum of
£6500, and Bishop Camidge is liable to pay £3500 more.
8. That the Sydney Real Estate Bank, Limited, is in
liquidation, and its properties are unsaleable at anything
like the price the Real Estate Bank gave for them.
4. That the whole of its properties and the uncalled
capital are mortgaged !
5. That no one oulside a lunatic asylum could be found
to take Real Estate Bank shares (with £3 ss. paid-up) as a
free gift.
The Bulletin makes no comments on these facts ; it
simply wants to know why on earth Bishop Camidge
should have indirectly prompted his Yorkshire audience
to rush into a form of investment—land-booming—which
will certainly result in a loss to him of £lO,OOO unless
another boom promptly takes place
* * * »
The other week a man got a verdict for .£4O
damages against a Melb. publisher. Defendant paid into
court the damages and costs —£63 in all—and shortly
afterwards the successful plaintiff received a bill for £ll
from his solicitors. This was represented as a balance
owing to them upon £74, the total cost of the legal victory.
The matter was finally settled by the solicitors cancelling
their £ll claim and making “a present” of £lO to their
client, who at this rate had been risking £74 plus the
defendant’s costs upon the chance of getting a tenner
thrown to him. A successful litigant is, as often as not,
a mere Lazarus waiting for crumbs to fall from his lawyers’
table.

A notorious Northern money-lender got a half-
witted Scotchman into play, and, on a perfect security,
landed over 300 per cent. As the “mug” owed some-
thing to two private detectives, who do a little money-
lending as well, he was induced to file his schedule. One
of the D’s. got the appointment as trustee, and promptly
issued an examination summons on the 300 per center,
whose modest nature, shrinking from public gaze (prob-
ably in the interests of business), induced him to disgorge
sufficient to satisfy the requirements of the two D’s. The
pigeon, however, still remains in its plucked condition.

considerable quantities. Fifield is situated about 60 miles
west of Parkes, and was until recently known as Burra
Burra. Platinum can be got on any surface hill; but the
richest deposit exists in Smith’s Lead. The sinking is an
average of 55ft. ; and, although platinum is down to
16s. Bd., if it did not exist the gold would not be worth
working. If a market could be found for platinum at
even half the price of gold this would be an extremely
flourishing place. Sixty-nine loads washed here some
time ago panned out at the rate of 23dwts. 4grs. platinum
per load. And many other claims can turn out ioz. to tba
load. At present the field supports 150 miners.

“ Nearly £1,000,000 of English money is being
invested in the Coolgardie troklfield," says an Adelaide
paper. And yet, in all probability, not more than
4-50,000 of this amount will ever find its way to Australia.
The other £950,000 will remain, in some form or ocher, in
London, among jobbers, promoters, and others. iVh"n
Australia sells a million pounds worth of its resources to
the British capitalist it gets mighty little of the money,
and it doesn’t always even get that.

Mr. Ohaffey Baker, in S.A. Register of 15th
Oct.: —“On Sept. 6 last Mr. E. W. Hawker and myself
sent to Queen-street a letter which proved that a sale of
1000 tons of carbonate ores had been made to the Dry
Creek Co. for one-third of its real value, notwithstanding
the repeated advice and protests of the manager, Mr.
Adams, and our repeated and emphatic dissents and
warnings.” Baker has been at loggerheads with the

now resigned as a director.
The Golden Mountain .
(FOR THE BULLETIN.)
Scrub; black scrub I on our onward way
Jt was with us ever the livelong day.
Scrub ; black scrub ! It was all around
The base of that naked granite mound.
You might scale the sides ’till you reached the
crest,
Scrub; black scrub to the east and west.
And all was lifeless, silent and still,
When we camped at the foot of that lonely hill,
Where the rooks were marked by the wandering
blacks
With the giant tread of the Devil’s tracks.*
There was water there, in a rock-hole deep,
And the night closed dark as we sought to sleep.
Sleep ? Does one sleep when the lust of gain
Fires the throbbing heart and the restless brain ?
When one longs for nought in Earth’s plenteous
store
But the yellow gleam of the golden ore ?
Peaceful and pure the stars shone bright,
But the Devil and Death were abroad that night.
My comrade slept, but I could not sleep,
And, 0 ! how I grudged him that slumber deep.
For I saw the scrub in the darkness loom,
No longer in silence and brooding gloom,
There were wild eyes glancing from every tree
And voices ! —’twas Madness, was calling me 1
I rose and shouted, and onward tore,
Death and the Devil strode fast before.
Bast—till the day broke bright ahead
And we came to the plain of the silent dead
Where there’s nothing but skull and bleaching
bone
Round the Golden Mountain that stands alone.
Quiet and still the dead men rest
Who have come to the end of their lifelong quest.
Quiet and still; though their peace they hold,
In the sleep of death they still grasp their gold.
For, grim and fast, every bony hand
Clenched tightly a handful of yellow sand.
I laughed as I looked at them, gaunt and white—
The men stark dead, with the gold in sight.
I noted, with joy, its wondrous shine,
For I was alive and—it all was mine !
Yes ; I laughed at the poor souls passed to Hell;
And the Devil and Death laughed loud, as well.
I rated them, “Fools,” with a taunting cry,
Who had found the mountain only to die.
And the empty skulls all seemed to hold
Their thoughts as they fell when they saw the
gold.
And a wondrous power was given me then
To read these thoughts of the dying men.
How some had sought it for home and wife.
And some for the joys of a reckless life ;
And many had come, in greed, for more,
To add and add to a bloated store.
And love and lust and the craze of gain
Brought them all to lie on the dead man’s plain.
But they all were dead. Dead as dead could be,
And the golden mountain belonged to me.
I sat and played with the yellow stones ;
And in scorn I pelted the dead men’s bones,
But the Devil’s whisper was in the air—
“Your mate is alive, and he, too, must share.”
Share? Share what I alone had found ?
I started up from the heated ground, '
I crossed the plain with a frantic tread,
Though the sun beat fierce on my burning head.
The skulls mowed at me with eyeless stare,
And their grim jaws chattered, “Your mate
must share !”
Though the scrub was thick, and the sand was
hot,
Fatigue and thirst were alike forgot.
Death followed me, chuckling all the way,
Through the choking heat of that awful day.
Night fell —but westward I ever kept,
Till I reached the rock where my mate still slept.
Still slept; I gave him no time to groan
Ere I smashed his skull with a heavy stone.
Then, drunk with murder as though with wine,
“You share ! ” I shouted ; “it all is mine !”
Black darkness suddenly smote the air,
I fell by his body, and slumbered there.
The morn was grey when I woke again,
But the cloud had passed from ray tortured brain.
Then the dream of gold came back strong and
clear—
I called to my comrade to wake, and hear.
Wake! But no calling can wake the dead.
My hands were bloody—the grass was red.
* In some parts of Western Australia the natives
scratch the semblance of a gigantic footprint with six
toes, on the rocks near their eamping-places. This is the
Devil’s track, and is supposed to propitiate him.
The Otis Ore Crusher.
Since last time of writing the Otis Crusher has
been doing excellent things, both at the Otis
Co.’s works at South Melbourne and on the
various mines in the Australias for which it has
been ordered. Mr. Perry, the general manager
of the Otis Engineering Co., is now on the
Murchison arranging to fix up a plant for
crushing, amalgamating, and the cyanide pro-
cess on the claim of the Austin G.M. Co.,
which was recently floated in London with a
capital of <£50,000. The management of this
Co. is in Melbourne. The Golden Bar (Cool-
gardie) has also ordered the erection of a plant
to treat 50 tons daily by dry crushing, amalga-
mation, and the cyanide.
Glen Wills (Vic.), which was originally
worked for tin, has been taken in hand by the
right people, and now the Homeward Bound
and Maud Consolidated have ordered from the
Otis Co. a crushing, amalgamating, and con-
centrating plant to treat 250 tons per day. The
United Bros. Co., on the same field, have
ordered a 20-head battery, engines, boilers,
amalgamating tables, and stone-crushers. In
this battery the great improvement is in the
details of the mortar-box, which provides an
improved inside amalgamation and a particu-
larly free discharge. The total weight of the
battery and plant is 92 tons, and, from its
various improvements, it is certain to treat more
stone per stamp than the old type. In this
connection we might further give extracts from
the Murchison Times and Day Dawn Gazette
of Aug. 25:
A very satisfactory yield is reported this week from the
New Chum mine, at the Magnet, which lias crushed 100
tons for a yield of 4450 z. with the Otis mill.
The Queen of the May crushing of 50 tons, which was
put through the Otis mill of the Francis Reward Com-
pany, was completed on Tuesday afternoon—a pretty cake
of retorted gold weighing 90oz. being the result.
The returns from the late crushing of the Cue One stone
is as follows :—The first consignment to the Francis Co.’s
Otis mill, of 50 tons, yielded at the rate of loz. lldwts.
per ton ; 60oz. had been previously dollied, which brings
the return for this parcel up to 2oz. 15dwts. per ton ; the
second consignment of 50 tons yielded at the rate of 3oz.
per ton, and the third of 150 tons 2oz. 7dwts. A fourth
parcel was sent to the South Day Dawn battery and
yielded an average of loz. lldwts. This is below the
general average of the stone, and is accounted for, per-
haps, by the coarseness of the crushing at the battery—
the tailings from the Otis mill are finer ground, and, as a
good deal of the gold in the Cue One stone is in a minutely
divided state, it is absolutely necessary that it should be
finely pulverised in order to effectually separate the small
particles of gold from the gangue. The actual results
obtained for the total crushing, as shown above, amount
to 7600 z. for 310 tons of stone, approximating to 2Joz.
per ton.
The Normanby, about half a mile north of the Light of
Asia, have just crushed 50 tons for 120 oz. being an
improvement on the former crushing, showing that the
stone is getting better as the reef goes down. The pro-
prietors, Messrs. Scamell, Meynell & Soamell, are highly
pleased with the manner in which the crushing was con-
ducted at the Francis Reward Otis Mill.
Of the stone raised from the workings of the Anglo-
Saxon mine, one-third, or 50 tons, has been sent away—
this parcel, treated at the Francis Otis Mill, averaged
2oz. 15dwts. per ton, and the owners expect similar results
from the next crushing.
The permanence of the Murchison district is without
doubt. The surface only has been scratched—not even
tickled—here and there, but every crushing whether by
an Otis mill or more orthodox battery of stampers tells
the same tale. On all sides 2oz. reefs abound, and the
gold is of greater value per ounce than that obtained
from any other field.
The Rising Sun (Prendergast and party) have crushed a
little over 100 tons at the Otis mill for a return of 2130 z.,
approximating over 2oz. per ton. This represents the
first parcel from the mine crushed at the mill: but for
two years previous to this the owners have paid expenses
and made a profit into the bargain, gold being won by
means of the dolly pot. This is the result of the clean-up
afterwards. The average value of the stone, therefore,
must have been much higher than 2oz. to the ton.
Messrs. Prendergast and partners are so satisfied with the
result obtained that they have arranged with Mr. Blunt,
the manager of the Otis mill, to put through another 300
tons.
The Francis Mill is now engaged in putting through
some of its own stone, and Mr. Blunt anticipates a good
yield.
It is a fact worthy of note that the “ Cue
One ” people had crushings with the Otis mill
and the ordinary battery, and that the results
of the Otis mill’s working, as detailed by the
Murchison Times, gave an appreciably greater
amount of the assay value of the stone than the
battery ever got within cooey of. *
Jerome K. Jerome once more. This self
constituted literary omnipotence admits that he
reads “very little fiction,” and, lower down,
serenely : “ I think that when a novelist reads
fiction it is fair evidence that the fiction is by a
better author than the novelist himself.” Now,
how comes it that J.K. J. reads any fiction?
“Max O’Rell” compares Australian wines,
“surcharged with alcohol as they generally are,”
to the French Roussillon wines, and predicts a
great future for Australian vignerons :
As yet Australia does not produce a thirtieth part of
the wine consumed by London alone. I predict that in 20
years Australia will be sending her wines to the four
corners of the world. When all the other inhabitants of
the world are drinking it, perhaps the Australians may
make up their minds to taste what it is like.
In S.A. they are now using, with much

It consists of apple-jelly and strychnia, it wipes out
the rabbits without spoiling their skins and
will probably kill a lot of children in the back-
blocks.
An Unquiet Spirit.

I HOLD my father’s memory in the greatest
respect. I have every reason for doing so.
Although his motives of life and mine were
diametrically opposed, this was never made a
bone of contention between us. I fell into step
. and marched dutifully with his views until his
death, at a ripe ago, left me free to live in a
manner more congenial to my disposition.
My father was a squatter —a fine, healthy fellow
of the old school. That is to say, a man who
believed in the work of his own hands, and was
never happy when away from the station. He
was devoted to cattle and horse-breeding, and
although the chances had many times been pre-
sented to him of leasing a huge area, and stocking
it with sheep, by the aid of a friendly bank, he
had always steadily refused. Thanks to this, he
died fairly well-off. Many years before his death,
I am happy to think, he had succeeded to the
height of his ambition. His compact, if small,
run, was so skilfully sub-divided that it could
almost workitself. His cattle were bred to that pitch
of perfection that the D A V brand was known
throughout Australia. His horses were sought for
eagerly as hacks or stock horses. To keep every-
thing up to this pitch became the old man’s one
idea. Method and order were his fetich, and
when he died he left me instructions to bury him
in his working clothes beside the stockyard. The
familiar sound of the trampling hoofs would, he
thought, soothe him in the long, last slumber. I
am afraid this idea was not a pronounced success.
I was twenty-five when my father died. He had
been a widower for twenty years, and soon after I
la,id him in the grave, in strict accordance with
his wishes, I commenced to look out for a manager
for Braganall Station. Although I had success-
fully concealed it during my father’s lifetime, I
hated bush life as much as he loved it. He died,
happy in the thought that his son would be a
worthy successor in the management of the
station he had created, little dreaming that that
son yearned to become a barrister.
1 soon found a competent manager named Dod-
son ; took up my abode in Sydney, and began read-
ing for the Bar. I had many advantages : an
independent income, a good education, and a first-
rate physical training. I worked hard for nearly
a year; then, feeling the need of a little relaxation,
I ran up to Braganall to spend a few weeks.
Everything seemed in good working order,
although I could not help noticing a falling off, in
little things, from the severe discipline of my
father’s time; but, then, I knew he had been a
martinet, and laid little stress upon this.
One evening, as the dusk was closing in, Dodson
and I sat smoking on the verandah in that medi-
tative silence bushmen enjoy so much. Two of
the men returning to their quarters passed within
earshot. “ Bill! ” I heard one of them say in the
calm stillness of the hour. “Did yer put them
sliprails on one side? ”
“ No, I forgot,” replied the other.
“ Better go back and do it, or old Dauvers will
be around after you.”
Without a word the man turned and went back,
and the other walked on.
What on earth did it mean? “Old Dauvers”
was my father. Dodson must have heard the
remark as well; the men, evidently, had not
noticed us as we were well within the shadow of
the verandah, therefore they had not lowered their
voices.
“ What does that mean about ‘ Old Dauvers ? ’ ”
I said.
“ I am sure I don’t know,” replied Dodson.
This I felt was an untruth. “Mr. Dodson,” I
remarked in a severe tone; “ I am sure you do
know, therefore I expect a plain answer to my
question. What did that man mean by saying
that my father would be around after him ?”
Dodson hesitated, then he blurted out : “The
men have some foolish yarn that Mr. Dauvers,
your father, walks.”
“ Walks !” I repeated. “ His ghost appears ?”
“ Something of the sort. If anything is left
neglected the man who did it can’t rest —he
dreams of your father until he has to get up and
go and do what he left undone, even if it’s in the
middle of the night.”
I could not help laughing. “The ghost must
be a good overseer, I said ; “ I suppose your men
are always leaving, with this notion going about ?”
“Not at all. They are not a bit afraid—they
say he always speaks quite kindly to them.”
“ More in sorrow than in anger,” I quoted.
“ Precisely so. I saw him once myself. He
looked in at my bedroom window ; stared at me
until I had to get up. Then I found that I had
left the garden gate open, and one of the milkers
had got in.”
I scarcely knew what to think of this communi-
cation. Bushmen, as a rule, are not in the least
superstitious—they have too much night-work to
fancy that the dark hours have uncanny denizens
peculiar to themselves. Although I practised
cross-examination on Dodson I could get no more
out of him, and, of course, it was useless asking
the men. I remained on the station for another
fortnight, but heard nothing more about the shade
of my departed parent.
11.
Two months after my visit to Braganall, I was
sitting in my chambers in Sydney, intent on my
work, when, happening to raise my eyes, I saw
my father in the room. He was dressed just as he
was buried; he advanced to the table and, without
speaking, commenced to put the things on it
straight. This was an old habit of his, as lat
once recognised. Anything on the table not in
its exact place always annoyed him. When every-
thing was neat and square he sank into a chair
and smiled kindly at me. Now I felt not the least
surprise, strange to say. It seemed the most
natural thing in the world for my father to pay
me a visit, although I was fully aware that he was
buried near the stockyard on Braganall.
“Jimmy,” he said, “I don’t think you have
acted quite fair to me.”
“ What’s the matter, governor?” I asked.
“ Why did you not let me know you preferred
this sort of thing ? ” and he indicated the papers
on the table. “I thought you meant to look after
the place yourself. ’ ’
“Honestly, I should have told you,” I replied,
“ but I thought you would be more contented if
you did not know.”
My father shook his head. “ I have nothing to
say against Dodson,” he went on; “he is a very
well-meaning young man, but he is going to make
a great mistake, and I want you to write and stop
him.”
I nodded, but kept silence.
My father then went into a detail of station-
management with which I need not trouble the
reader. I could see (for was I not my father’s
pupil?) that it was just the kind of mistake that a
young and enthusiastic manager like Dodson
would fall into. I at once wrote the letter, and en-

closed it in an envelope, my father watching com-
placently. When I had finished he said ;
“ I don’t want to annoy you, Jim, but you see
*t’s this way. I’m in Kama at present.”
“ Kama? ” I said.
“Yes, Kama Loka. I am on my way to
Devachan, but these little worries rather delay
me, for you see Kama is only an astral counter-
part of our physical existence, and until I am
quite satisfied that I need not bother any more
about Braganall my entity will not be properly
established in Devachan.”
“ I understand,” I said ; but, of course, I didn’t,
My father beamed on me with his old kindly
look, and left.
He came to see me, on little matters, once or
twice after that. Several people came in and saw
him there, but they only took him fora queer sort
of client. Medicine and the law are privileged
that way.
Once, however, he put me out a little, and
forced me into the meanest action of my life. It
was at a garden-party, and a swell affair at that,
when I suddenly became aware that all eyes were
turned my way, and that my father, in his bush
dress, was standing by me.
“Jim !” he said, in an undertone, “ I can’t help
it; I’ve had no rest for a fortnight. There’s the
gate-post of the drafting-yard been pushed out of
place, the gate doesn’t hang plumb, and Dobson
doesn’t get it straightened up.”
“ I’ll send him a telegram about it at once,” I
answered, hastily.
“ You will ?” queried the old man. “You know
I’ll never get to Devachan at this rate.”
“I will,” I affirmed, and then, for everyone
was looking at us, I put my hand in my pocket,
then into his hand, as though I was giving alms
to a persistent beggar, and he went away satisfied,
Now, to pass off the shade of one’s father as an
intrusive loafer who had to be got rid of at any
price, is, I think, the greatest piece of moral
cowardice a man can be guilty of. I have never
fully recovered my self-respect since.
These constant visits, however, made trouble
upon the station. Dodson felt aggrieved that I
should be always writing or wiring up about petty
little things that might well be left to him, and,
moreover, concluded that I must have a spy on
the place who supplied me with the information,
This led to his resignation, and put me in such a
fix that, in desperation, I decided to sell the
station.
Our neighbour on Braganall was an old friend
of my father’s, and a man after his own heart. His
two sons, unlike me, were squatters to the back-
bone; so I wrote to him and put the place under
offer. Somewhat to my relief, my father, or his
astral counterpart, did not object to this. He
seemed to think that, failing me, the sons of his
old friend would do justice to Braganall. Nego-
tiations were, therefore, soon concluded, and
Manxton became the owner of the well-known
D A V herd.
I had now some peace from the constant visita-
tions of my father, and about that time I fell
deeply in love. Contrary to proverbial wisdom,
the course of our true love ran smoothly through-
out, and our wedding-day was approaching when
I received a letter from young Manxton which
somewhat unsettled me. We were old friends
from boyhood’s time, therefore he addressed me
without any ceremony. “Look here, old fellow,”
his letter ran, “ when the old man bought this
place I don’t think he took delivery of any ghosts;
at least, they were not mentioned in the agree-
ment. I wish you could induce your ancestral
spook to let me manage the station my own way.
Young Manxton had a blunt way of putting it,
but, under the circumstances, I felt I could pardon
him.
I saw fresh trouble ahead, but could do nothing
but write back and treat his letter as a joke.
11l-
Jt wanted but a week to our wedding-day, and
Laura and I were deep in confidential conversa-
tion one evening when the astral figure of my
father appeared. Laura gave a big jump and a
little shriek at his sudden appearance, then sat
quiet, whilst my father said :
“ Jim, you must do something for me. I know
you can’t properly interfere, but young Manxton
is going to sell Silverside and go in for breeding
trotters.”
At this moment Julia sprang up with a loud
cry. “ Jim ! Jim !” she half shrieked it’s your
father, I know him from the likeness you showed
me. Oh ! oh ! it’s his ghost!”—and she went off
into a faint, and I caught her and put her on the
sofa. I looked reproachfully at the old man and
he went out without opening the door, which was
contrary to his usual habit. Then Laura’s mother
came in and wanted to know what the matter was
and who was the stranger she met in the hall. I
said weakly I did not know, but would go after
him if she would look after Laura, for I was
anxious to get away before she came to,
I passed a restless night, and the next morning
the post brought me a letter of farewell from my
sweetheart. She pointed out clearly that there
were but two conclusions to arrive at. Either my
father was not dead and had committed some
criminal action which necessitated his disappear-
ance, or it was his ghost. Now, in either case our
marriage was an impossibility—she could not
marry a man whose father had served a term in
gaol; nor could she become the wife of one who
had a ghostly progenitor popping up at convenient
and inconvenient times. To this there was no
answer, at least I had none to offer ; and it was
not until I had worried my brain for hours that I
saw a ray of hope ahead.
I wrote to Laura and her mother saying that I
would offer them a satisfactory and ample ex-
planation. Then I wrote to Manxton and asked
him to delay the sale of Silverside (one of the sires
of the Braganall stud) until he heard further from
me. Then I sat and waited.
I was not disappointed; my father, looking
very penitent, made his appearance. “I’m aw-
fully sorry, Jim, but I was so upset when I found
out that Manxton was going to sell Silverside that
I came in without thinking.”
“ It’s been my own fault as well,” I returned,
for I could not bear to see the old chap so miser-
able. “However, I think I have found out a way
to put things straight again. In the first place, I
am going to buy Braganall back.”
My father shook his head; his business shrewd-
ness was evidently a portion of the astral counter-
part of his physical existence. “He’ll make you
pay through the nose when he finds you want it.
I know Manxton.”
“But I think you can assist me to get it back at
my own figure,” I returned, and showed him
young Manxton’s letter.
“ Now, can’t you make things so ghostly uncom-
fortable up there that he’ll be glad to almost give
me the place back?”
My father became perfectly luminous with de-
light. “ Bless you, boy !” he said, and was about
to vanish, when I recalled him.
“ There’s more to be done yet. I have to make
it right with Laura. lam going to manage
Braganall myself, now that I am about to be
married, but, for all that, some little slips may
occur which might worry you and delay you on
your passage to—where is it?”
“Devachan,” said my father.
‘‘ Devachan, yes. Do you think you could
materialise a letter when you have anything to
say ? I shall probably keep a room somewhere in
Sydney where you could write.”
“ Certainly I could. Why did I not think of it
before ?”
“Now, will you be here to-morrow at 11 o’clock,
and, before Laura and her mother, give me your
word that you will in future confine yourself to
letter-writing when anything goes wrong. You
see it’s this way, Dad. I enjoy seeing you im-
mensely, but the women, you know, are pre-
judiced.”
“ I quite understand it,” replied the shade and
departed.
I called on Mrs. Lyntott, Laura’s mother, who
is a remarkably strong-minded woman, and laid
the whole ease before her. She reconciled me to
Laura, and they agreed to meet my father at my
rooms the next morning.
Tiie inconsistency of womenkind ! Before that
meeting concluded they had taken such a liking to
that astral being that they both regretted deeply
the compact that had been entered into. “ I
should have been very glad to see you occasionally,
Mr. Dauvers,” said my prospective mother-in-
law, and Laura uttered a like wish. However,
the thing was done. A ghost must keep its word,
once passed; and we parted with mutual feelings
of regret.
Before leaving, my father whispered to me : “I
gave young Manxton such a night of it last night.
I expect you’ll hear from him to-day.”
It is now many years since this happened, and
as I have never received a materialised letter, I
presume that earthly matters have ceased to
trouble the good old gentleman, and my manage-
ment of Braganall has been satisfactory. His
conscious unit has, I hope, passed from Kama
Loka to the higher spiritual plane of Devachan.

To feel again the young green glinting.
So long, so long, have they been sad
Beneath the winter’s withered kisses
Their hearts run riot, and go mad
For joy of spring’s delirious blisses.
Their hearts run riot in the whirl
Of subtle spring-tide’s warm embraces;
The baby-leaves uncurl, uncurl,
Till spring can kiss their tender faces.
And, oh, the red, the wonder red,
That subtly weaves the world with glory,
And resurrects the last year’s dead,
And fires with flame the branches hoary.
What day was that, one far-off spring,
When you and I set out to plunder
The half-blown blossoms, and to sing
The sweetest song the sky-worlds under.
That spring-time was not over-long,
Not long as hearts count time together—
It may be that our broken song
Was all too sweet for earthly weather;
Earth sighed when winter slowly stilled
The tender throb of spring and summer.
But we—how long have we been chilled
And frozen as a far new-comer.
Laugh, earth, and glow in this glad hour,
Forget awhile your winter’s glooming,
Your fields blow many a time with flower,
Love’s spring alone knows one spring’s blooming,
Sydney.

Fitts v. Fitts, a recent Melb. divorce-case,
Misfits.
Maurice Holtze, S.A. botanist, pleads for
rational names for Australian trees and plants.
He enumerates 12 white gums, 10 blue gums, 8
red gums, 4 spotted gums, 8 ironbarks, 8 stringy-
barks, 3 mallees, 4 woolly-butts, 4 bloodwoods,
and 7 peppermints. These are constantly being
confused, and Mr. Holtze suggests united action to
adopt distinctive names. Then why shea-oak,
when oasuarina is no more like an oak than Max
O’Rell is like Milton ? Why not quandong for
native peach? In fact, why not simplify all round,
adopting the aboriginal names as far as possible,
and suiting others to the plant ? There is really
no opposing reason.
