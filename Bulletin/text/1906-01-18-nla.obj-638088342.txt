THE RED PAGE.
DALET
HE was Irish, to begin with ; but which
Irish? There are so many. “That
it is possible to identify a race
by their personal appearance and
dispositions,” I, with the learned Mac
Fir bis, “do not take it upon myself posi-
tively to say ; though it may have been true
in the ancient times, until the race became
repeatedly intermixed.” Yet some Irish
approximate more clearly to the Milesian type
than others; and Daley was one of the others,
a hybrid. When we talked of the matter,
jestingly, he would refer Quinn to the (possi-
bly mythical) Tuatha De Danann —the race
which includes ‘ ‘ Everyone who is fair-
haired, vengeful, large, and every plunderer. ”
He himself, with whatever Celtic admixture,
had an ancestry of black-haired Firbolgs.
And these distinctions are not all fanciful.
That curious want of homogeneity in the
Irish character, which makes many indivi-
duals seem to onlookers (and even to them-
selves) a bundle of opposites, may be traced
more than plausibly to the imperfect admix-
ture of antagonistic races.
Yet Daley was not all Irish : his mother
was a Morrison, of Scotch descent. I
impute to her the prudence and circum-
spection that warred with his impulsive-
ness. Said a man who had known him long
and intimately : ‘ ■ You think Daley is frank,
warm-hearted and careless? Would it sur-
prise you to know that he is cold, calcu-
lating, cynical ? ” I owned it would—if it
were so, But it was not so. Daley was
not reckless, he was cautious : he held
himself in reserve behind his cordial manner ;
but he simply could n’t be bothered planning
and calculating his conduct. He was essen-
tially what he seemed. True, parts of him
lagged behind the rest ; and it always
appeared that when he drank he was
endeavouring unconsciously to spur the
Scotch ancestor level with the Irish one.
Liquor made him equal to himself.
He was cold-blooded, warm-brained ; and
every day he had to raise his tem-
perature to the height of his temperament.
Of this curious duality he was well aware :
he has. pictured it in his apologue of Victor
and James. But, because of it, to represent
him as characteristically calculating and
cynical: that is unjust. The responsible
Morrison may have calculated at breakfast-
time, but long before tea-time the irrespon-
sible Daley had scattered calculation to the
winds. They were uneasy bedfellows, and
sometimes the Scotchman had the biggest
share of the bed ; but it was n’t long before
the Irishman kicked him out. He always
came back again, and so the strife went on.
J*
The contending forces were so equal that
Daley was an uncommonly sane man, an
uncommonly well-balanced man, if you took
the average of his twenty-four hours. At
any hour in the twenty-four one arm of the
balance might be kicking the beam ; but
the characteristic balance persisted, and
the weights always came even. That
quality of balance was one of Daley’s
social charms : he was sensible. Hotter-
blooded, he would have written better poetry ;
colder-headed, he would have made his
talents more profitable commercially ; —being
the amalgam he was, he did what he could,
and his outlook on life was eminently equable
and healthy. Outlook is not conduct; yet,
judged by years and not by moments, Daley’s
conduct of life was -equable and healthy
too—for him. With all drawbacks, the world
went well with him : he was loath to leave it.
To meditate a fancy, to rhyme it, to saunter
down town and be paid for it, to meet boon
companions, and presently to saunter home :
it was a daily round not without compensa-
tions for its distresses. I remember 1 a well-
placed journalist speaking of it scornfully.
I looked at him, and thought of the man lie
had been, the man wjho came down from the
Bush years ago—hearty, enthusiastic, seeth-
ing with altruistic aspirations; and I saw
the man he had become under the heel of
Respectability—with his open pice grown
narrow, his candid eyes grown shifty, his
whole appearance that of a man who dared
not lift his chin above the rut of routine, a
man cowed. And I knew that Daley had
the best of it. If his feet were in the gutter,
his head was in the stars.
Jt
Yet I would venture a paradox : Daley
was respectable too. Not with the Respecta-
bility that is a capital crime ; yet “respect-
able.” He had an instinct for conventional
decency, and abode by conventional, canons.
He shrank from foul or evil language, from
gross stories, from violence of any kind—
physically shrank and felt a physical nausea
when the offence was serious. Yet often he
risked such offence ; for he hated solitude,
was eminently sociable, and when he could
not be sociable with somebody he was
sociable with everybody. Dull souls sought
him eagerly for diversion : “ I’m entertained
at dinner and provide the entertainment,”
he said quite truly. Part of his business in
life was to exchange things spiritual for
things material or spiritual; but he did not
invariably admire his cohort of admirers. I
found him once in the street, very sick, very
pale. “It wasn’t the drink,” he said ; “it
was the company.” Victor was in the same
company next day ; and James hid his mental
reservation.
Jt
He wasn’t religious. He was Irish and
formally Catholic ; but he never went to
church, never dreamed of going to con-
fession. With priests he talked gaily, as
with ordinary mortals; and they answered
him with the same coin. One or two “made
desperate attempts to convert me,” he
related; “it seemed sad to see a son
of Holy Church aloof from the fold.” That
made no impression o; i him ; he adhered to
his non-belief that did not go as far as un-
belief. “But you’ll die in the faith,” I
told him. “ No, I won’t,” he said ; “ I ’ll bet
you anything you like.” “ Well,” said I,
“ we’ll see.' And we saw him die in the
faith, with all the unctions and solemnities.
That he died non-believing 1 have no shadow
of doubt; but I have no doubt he said to
himself, ‘ ‘ What does it matter, anyway ?
It ’ll please all these good people, and
it won’t hurt me. What’s the use of
making a fuss ? ” That was Daley precisely.:
he was sensible.
Jt
It was a pleasure to see him with ladies :
he took such pleasure with them, was so
flattering and flowery. Some of them purred
under his tongue like pussycats. Even at the
last, when he tuanked the nuns for their
kindness—and was told to thank 1 not us,
but the grace of God ” —he flashed out :
“And aren’t you the Grace of God ?”
Was n’t it pretty 'l Yet his admiration was all
according to Plato; and he told me, “I’d
sooner .talk to a man than a woman any day.
Ten minutes exhausts them.” Like others,
he had fair correspondents now and again—
lured like motns to the light of his verses.
He answered them according to their kind;
kindly ; he felt kindly, but he didn’t feel
warmly. Chiefly the Sex appealed to him
as a collection of beautiful natural objects—
or subjects of art.-
Jt
Daley always reminded me of Tom Moore
—a poet whom he had carefully read and
scarcely ever referred to. Both lacked depth
and passion to be great poets; both deco-
rated line fancies with fine verses; both
had a gay satirical vein ; both were ‘ ‘ the
hoighth of company.” I think they are
a good match, though Daley had a poorer
ear and wrote in pictures ; Moore wrote
more musically, less brilliantly. Both
were popular, and careful of their popularity.
Moore was more fortunate ; he got a pension;
but I don’t know that he was more fortunate
in living longer, and dying by years and
inches with a decaying brain. Daley lived
till the last : his strong nervous organisation
upheld him when his body otherwise had
failed. And his disease did not take him as
it took F. and H. Adams, with a rending and
tearing of the lungs into fragments. He
died gently, as he had lived.
jt
Daley was Irish and un-Irish : his sense
of humour was n’t Irish : it extended to him-
self. In that way he was very comforting.
When people praised his wonderful poetry he
spoke of “ my little verses,” and meant what
he said. “ I know precisely where I stand,”
he told me often. And he wrote : “I have
tried to make a pleasant garden of
dreams.” Thought and passion he de-
clared that he avoided deliberately:
the one made a writer dull, the
other was apt to make him raucous.
“And if you want examples, “he added
cynically, “look around.” I shouldn’t call
him witty in the sense that Sheridan
was witty : the man who said, “ when there
was some proposal to lay a tax upon mile-
stones, that it was unconstitutional, as they
were a race that could not meet to-remon-
strate. ” The hard lustre of that saying,
I think, was not in Daley. He had
a light wit, bright, but not the
keenest. His humour was characteristic,
softer and always shining : it played always
in him and around him. His good stories,
as he told them, were very good; and he
liked telling them, was jealous of his lime-
light, desired the centre of the stage and to
be the central figure of his company. And
in my experience he always was : he deserved
his social honours fully.
Jt
There’s a great deal more to say—there
always is. It all amounts to saying that he
was a good fellow ; he did good work j he
rests.

Madame, Will You Walk l by Beth Ellis (Lond.,
Blackwood ; 2s. 6d.) includes five romances of 18th-cen-
tury England, wound round a set of leading characters.
The incidents are well-invented and gay. People who
have not lost taste for “ the historical novel ” of current
commerce will find in the book an agreeable dissipation
of time and places.
THE SILENT LAND
IN his new booklet of The Silent Land and
Other Verses (Melb., Lothian; Is.) Bernard
o’Dowd writes in a mellower, softer, sweeter
tone than in Downward —perhaps in a more
poetical tone ; but he writes with gentler emotion
and less force. The book opens stiffly; as he
goes, tne author improves his work, and some-
times gives fine expression to fine ideas. More
often he is cramped by his crustacean stanza—a
regular 4-3 iambic quatrain, with alternating
rhymes ; and frequently his ear plays him false”
Apparently he feels restraint, for he has varied
his regular metre with long and short lines, not
very successfully. O’Dowd’s capacity is so good
that one wishes he would perfect himself in the
technic of verse. This book would serve well as a
subject for a lesson in prosody to senior classes
E.g.:
Boys—look at stanza 2, page 1 (remembering that one
poem can only have one soul in one body ; and that, finally
chosen, the form you choose is fixed, and its parts must
harmonise with each other and the whole).
’T is woven with the world we hear ,
In subtlest tapestry :
Our sounds are but translations clear
Of its dumb symbolry.
Never write so. Never spoil your regular iambic beat,
that regular iambic quatrain, with two weak end-rhymes.
One, if you like, to alter monotony and soothe the ear;
never two. Suppose the second line to end on a mono-
syllable : then your “ symbolry ” closes the fourth line
with a graceful fall, though the device should not be em-
ployed often. Regular iambics have their own stalwart
virtue, and a regular iambic poem must rest upon that.
Look at stanza 4 :
Our half-felt sighs some tale tell true
Of the Silent Land’s romance,
Of the Silent Me and the Silent You,
Enamoured or 'askance,
Here see our author, who formerly stepped firmly in the
iambic rut of short-long, short-long - , breaking his rule in
lines 2 and 3, endeavouring to vary his melody. A com-
mendable idea ; but does not the repetition of the-the-the
jar upon your ear ? It should. Avoid weakening mascu-
line verse «.th too many articles, trivial words, insigni-
ficances.
Again, stanza 6:
Abort in life, but full-bom there,
These interplay with fact.
Confound our courage when we dare,
Baulk when we would act.
Admire the pondered subtlety of line 4. An essential
part of art in verse, of course, is to give every word its
value, considering it in itself as well as in its context.
Here the dropped short-syllable has to be recovered by a
pause after “ baulk,” giving the word its due importance
—and “ the line too ” baulks to meet the idea. Unluckily
three unstressed words follow, and that line is scarcely
metrical at all. The measure is so short that it will not
endure more than one variation in one line. Besides,
“ abort ” and “ full-torn ” in line 1 confuse the sound-
values. One likes ; but
Presently comes a line
Alert for Circumstances sign
To incarnate again.
That full stress on “ nate ” is ugly. So is the stress on
“ when
They linger round the Artist when
—and our author rhymes “when” with “man."
They glide about our business
—Odear! Anyway you take it. “business" is one of
the distressing words in verse. And look at these linc3 :
It's is an everlasting sphere.
“Its hiss” —with a superfluous apostrophe. (And why
“ trepannes ” for “ trepans ” ?)
To Celtic harper, and unread
By Scald Tradition.
(Reminds one of the parish clerk’s hymn for Guy Fawkes’
day:
'T was on this day, this very day,
That villains did conspire
To blow up the Houses of Parliament
With gun-de-pow-de-hire.)
Again;
And the snow’s feet slow retire.
“ Snow’s feet slow ” —terrible 1 Boys, get your Swin-
burnes, and we’ll read “ When the hounds of spring are
oh winter’s traces ” to improve our ear for sibilants.
Is not that enough by way of fault-finding ?
This must be added, that (Irishly) O’Dowd’s work
grows too long : he has too many dead, emotion-
less verses, in which even the intellectual images
are poor and handled awkwardly. Surely he is
on the wrong line of metre: the sonnet is his
true form, and it is a form worthy of a master’s
study.
&
“The Silent Land” is a group-title for the
book’s leading themes: follow “Fallow” and
“Fas” in the same metre; a quaint, savoury
sonnet “Quail” (with a curious misuse of the
word “ruth”); and “Love and Sacrifice”—per-
haps the most poetical piece O’Dowd has
written.
“The Silent Land” is the world of the sub-
conscious mind, the mind of instinct, the mind of
one’s ancestors, the mind of the crowd, with
all its thronging and perplexing restraints and
urgencies, lights of marsh and Grail—that Other-
World that is everywhere in us and around us,
never seen, seldom recognised, felt perpetually—
the mystic World behind the Veil which is yet a
physical World behind the Man.
O’Dowd has brooded his idea well and devel-
oped it skilfully. “ All men live here, but know
it not,” he commences. The lost dreams, lost
deeds, are in the shadowy limbo of “ The Silent
Land.” O’Dowd transfers to that domain the
doctrine of the conservation of energy, and gives
a psychical immortality to every tnought and
emotion of the ages.
It has been written that O’Dowd’s expression is
less forcible; but his thought has grown deeper,
fuller. “ The Common Room ”is intellectually a
fine statement of a pantheistic idea—for all-god-
head readirtg all-mortality, taken as equivalent to
all-immortality.
Is there behind all men that live
One all-containing Soul,
Whose symbols, apt for each one, give
A transcript of the Whole ?
These are deep waters, but O’Dowd swims at ease
and lucently.
Our many-celled abode, mankind,
Provides each unit guest
With a cheery common-room behind
Where the Silent Archives rest...
Are any dead ? or is it but ,
'Some lea ve that room to play
At lonely games, in life’s cell shut,
And some prefer to stay ?
It is not poetry, but poetical philosophy, finely
stated. Fit readers must be directed to the book
for satisfaction. O’Dowd’s mind is lofty com-
pany, and many of his verses display it beautifully
and well. One may end quotation with some
f of his singing stanzas :
R. Bedford's The Snare of Strength has received
uncommonly good notices from the London press
—which sees in the book just the kind of crude,
vigorous romance that an Englishman expects
from barbaric Australia. The best critical appre-
ciation comes in The St. James’s Budget , which
writes that
There are few books with a stronger promise and a
more unequal performance. . . It might almost have been
written by two different hands. There is originality in
it—sometimes even, startling originality. There is the
breath of passion alternating' with feeble, almost vulgar
sentiment. There is tenth-rate dialogue, and there is
dialogue full of flashes of wit and shrewdness. At one
moment the “strong” men of the story are servants’-
hall heroes, at the next they thrill the reader with the
life that is in them. The women are overdrawn,
especially the siren, whose plaintive crudity would have
been no temptation to forewarned males with a sense of
humour. There is a craving for new words, especially
new nouns, that causes the pages to be peppered with
such fearful wild fowl as “ roborant,” “oliveness,”
“mirifleent,” “tonicity,” and so on, where more usual
words would have done as well or better.
The justice of this should be admitted by the
author himself. For its greater part The Snare
of Strength is really below Bedford’s own merit.
The last chapters would have made a dramatic
short story; and instead of building and shaping
his book Bedford has simply started some of the
characters a few months farther back, and written
them along—good day’s work, bad day’s work—
till he reached the catastrophe. The journalistic
bulk of the book is inferior to Bedford’s own first-
class work (as, for example, in the vivid and vital
impressions of London recently contributed to
The Bulletin). Bedford has a big talent, and the
way to do justice to it (in book-form, at all events)
is to take care not to strain his literary voice
farther than it will go. The ordinary tones of
that energetic voice are level with other men’s
top-notes ; and Bedford’s top-notes are steam-
whistles. When he falls just short of “ fine
writing” his writing is fine; when he goes
farther he gets into fustian. His keenness of
observation, his pungency of expression, are
always manifest; he has genuine vision and
emotion ; but throughout The Snare of Strength
he seems to need the admonition one remembers
given by a veteran manager to a young actor:
“Don’t strut. Don’t scream.”
N.S. W. Forest Flora, part 8, by J. H. Maiden
(Syd., Govt. Printer, Is.), deals with Flindersia schottiana
(the Cudgerie); Eucalyptus reg nans (the giant gum tree);
and Cusuarina suberosa (the black she-oak). The last-
named Mr. Maiden especially recommends for our deco-
rative cultivation. The article on E. regnans is interest-'
ing to the multitude, since the big-tree question is fully
discussed, and there are two fine photographic illustra-
tions of big Victorian trees at Narbethong and Dandenoug.
The singular point about a giant guni tree is that it
decreases its size the closer you get to it. Ten miles from
a notorious big tree the bush public will declare with one
voice that it is 500 ft. high. Five miles away it shrinks to
400 ft.; and when a surveyor reaches and measures the tree
it may come down to 326 feet 1 inch—which is the height
of the tallest tree yet found in Australia (on a spur of Mt.
Baw-Baw. Gippsland, 91 miles from Melbourne). Mr.
Maiden’s pages describing this remarkable procedure on
the part of big trees are worth reading. For comparison
the American redwood is quoted. A specimen of this
sequoia has been measured at 340 feet, and the Californian
“ big tree ” (S. wellingtonia) is quoted as great as 107 feet
in girth; therefore, “so far as our knowledge goes at
present, California is the home both of the tallest and of
the broadest trees in the world.” Mr. Maiden gives also
a photograph of a mountain ash forest, and four botanical
plates of the three trees dealt with—altogether a liberal
•hillingwortb.
A.Q.S.
Yea, life is thick with forms, ashins
With exiled wills of mem,
Alert for Circumstance’s sign
To incarnate again ...
They build its moral archetypes,
Cement Tradition’s walls,
Lead Inspiration’s conduit-pipes
From Higher Waterfalls ;
They glint through rosy Fancy’s sky
With transient Reason’s fires,
Flit by the face of Reverie
As callow-winged Desires...
We are not all the Self we seem ;
We are twined around loitli men
Who once performed this mortal dream ,
And dream in us again.
We are bundles of the great and good.
The wanderer, the slave ;
We are thewed with ancient hardihood,
We are garlands of the brave:
Our moods are racial ardours, woes ;
Our prides, primeval fame
Transformed into the wind that blows
On an emotion’s fiame :
Our moments, bright or sad, are ports
Whereto some old ship brings
A smile, a sigh from sylvan courts
Of prehistoric kings...
That is good philosophy, good poetry, and good
humanity.

Another Convincing Proof
THIS TIME AT MERRYLANDS.
The Gate of Mr. H. ALMOND.
(By a Local Roporter.)
Whilst much of the anguish and grief
which exist in some families as the re-
sult of ill-health is hid from the gaze
ot the outside world, and' is known
only to those who are immediately
concerned,, sufficient transpires to ex-
cite the sympathy of every genuine
philanthropist, ana to bring forth
strenuous efforts on behalf of suffering
humanity. Here is an instance in which
the reader will recognise a desire on
the part of Mr. Henry Almond, store-
keeper, Park-road, Merrylands, to ex-
tend a helping hand to any who may
be afflicted as he was some years back.
“It, was when I was living in Tam-
worth/' said Mr. Almond, “that X
fir'st knew what bad health was, and
that .must be a good while back, for i
have been living here these fourteen
years past."
“In what way was your health af-
fected ?'“ enquired a man from the
office.
“Well, for two years previous to
coming here, and for a good while af-
ter starting this business, I was al-
most mad with neuralgia, and you
may guess that having a complaint
like that so long must have had a
direful effect upon my system general-
ly. Really, sometimes I was fairly x-ug-
ing, owing to the agQny I was in, and
many a, time wished that 1 was dead
and out of the world altogether. Oh !
it was a life of fearful misery, and I
pity any poor soul in similar straits.
You may .rest assured that I resorted
to pretty, well every known treatment
in the hope of gaining some relief, but.
success evaded all my efforts. My
gums,. my jaws, the cheek bones were
the papts where the torture principally
existed; but, curiously enough, there
were days when one side of my face
and head was affected till nightfall,
and then the pains shifted over to the
other side. And as for sleep—well, do
you think anybody could sleep under
such adverse circumstances ? I know I
couldn’t, as a rule, though, at loner
intervals, when nature could not hpld
out any longer, I lapsed into a state
of unconsciousness that might be called
sleep, and whilst it lasted 1 had the
worst dreams you could think of."
“I don’t suppose you were usually
lit to do much work ?"
“Indeed I was not, and I was a)so
so low-spirfted that I did not seem to
care whether I was ever able to work
again or not. As a matter of fact I
had no interest in anything, excepting
that I wanted to get better if it were
possible, which didn’t seem very like-
ly, for instead of getting better 1 got
worse as the months wore on. Short Iv
after the neuralgia attacked mo. I no-
ticed that my digestion was getting
bad, and so it continued to fail until
eventually my internal organs were so
completely upset that even the lightest
of food! could not be assimilated. A
heavy sensation in the chest, which
made, it impossible to draw a deep
breath, was one of my daily discom-
forts, and after eating a little mv
stomach became inflated, and caused
considerable discomfort until the wind
was all belched away. My tongue had
a dirty coating, and the taste in mv
mouth of a morning was most dis-
agreeable—clearly indicating the bi-
lious state t was in; and another
thing that troubled me was my sight
—very poor indeed sometimes, while
my eyes felt twice their proper size,
and as heavy as lead. Between mv
shoulders I had more pains to bear,
and I ached so much across the loins
that it was painful to walk even a
short distance. But you’ve no idea of
the fearful state of nervousness I got
into —used to give little jumps and
twitches, as though I had St. Vitus’
dance sometimes, and the unsettled
frame of mind I was in gave rise to
much mental misery also. Simple mat-
ters irritated me, and caused undue
excitement, and 1 tell you candidly I
couldn't find a moment's peace or hap-
piness anyhow.”
‘‘Alter so much ineffective treatment
how did you manage to get well
again ?"
“This way : A new customer came to
the shop one day, and, seeing how ill
1 was, said ‘Did you ever try Clements
Tonic ?' I said : ‘Wo ; and I’m sick of
taking physics.’ He came in again, and
asked if 1 had got any yet, to which
1 answered in tne negative. He said :
‘Well, try a bottle ; it won’t break
you/ and at last 1 did, for which I
am devoutly thankful. Oh ! it was like
something you read about in a novel,
the way Clements Tonic served mo;
but it was a joyful reality neverthe-
less. To think that I had suffered for
years, and only then had got a re-
medy to do me good was something
to be thankful for, and I was, too.
Why, Clements Tonic began to sootho
my nerves when I had only taken two
or three bottles, and you couldn’t cre-
dit the amount of ease it had given me
already ; it roused the weakened ener-
gies of my system and stimulated my
appetite to such a degree that before
long I was eating as well as ever—
when the neuralgia had entirely gone, of
course you can guess how grateful I was.
It is also in regard to indigestion that
Clements Tonic is deserving of recogni-
tion at my hands, for that was, after
all, one of the principal things from
which J suffered. Yes ; my last remedy
fairly opened my eyes as to what me-
dicine really can do when it is of the
right kind, for in spite of everything
else failing, Clements Topic set to
work, and put me right in no time. A
few weeks’ use of it made such an al-
tered man of me that I had nearly
forgotten what it was like to get up
feeling half-dead with weariness. My
breath was sweet, and I had no un-
pleasant taste in my mouth of a
morning, my eyes were bright and the
sight good, .1 slept soundly each
night, every pain had gone, so what
more could any man wish for ?”
‘‘And what has your hoalth been
like since V”
"Splendid, excepting on an occasion
when 1 contracted influenza through
getting up all hours at night during
my wife’s illness. She was suffering
from influenza, too, and soon there
was a pair of us, so we had to close
shop for a while. My word, we did
have a bad time ! Wife got like a bag
of bones, but Clements Tonic made her
eat four or five meals a day, and she
was soon well again. I was awfully
weak and miserable ; mv nerves broke
down again, and once more I suffered
the tortures of neuralgia ; but not for
long though, as I knew what would
cure me, and so it did. Yes, Clements
Tonic showed its wonderful properties
again, and I’ve such belief in its cur-
ing capacities that I recommend its
use to all. More than that, you can
publish my story in any manner that
your mind may suggest.”

The Maid of the Barricade.
“ One of the barricades was commanded by a girl of 18.'
—Cable message describing the revolt at Moscow.
We bow to you as the daughter
Of Freedom in all the lands;
Comrades, over the water,
Offer their idle hands.
Mother of Change renascent!
Shame-faced we and afraid—
We in our ease complacent,
You on your barricade.
We fight for the Right as women,
You as but few men do,
With a confidence calm and grim in
The face of the odds you knew.
The puling strife of the polling,
A battle sublime we made ;
Till we see, where the guns are rolling,
You on the barricade.
We know not whether you perished,
But the heart that was free from fear,
We pray that the Fates have cherished
From the shell and the Cossack spear.
For your country will need it later
To throb with the bearing drums,
When another fight and a greater
For the Cause of the People comes.
We wish you a man deserving
To win such a maiden’s kiss,
For a wealth of love is conserving
In a heart that can hate like this;
And the fervors red it was showing,
E’er the last fierce fight was done,
Should yet through your veins be flowing
To nourish a rebel son.
Ragged, with hair dishevelled,
Smeared with the powder-smoke—
What though your ranks were levelled,
Or the last lone legion broke—
You stand at your post alone, a
Rebuke to the ranks dismayed •
A type of the Red Bellonft
Are you, on-your barricade.

Kelly in Greece.
Last week, the “ Stonewall’’ sleeping
Upon its bed of pain,
Hermes, wing-heeled, came peeping
At Kelly’s jaded brain.
Led him, as deep he pondered
In lobster dreams of peace
To Delos, whence he wandered
Through ancient, youthful Greece.
White marbled towns were flashing
Under Aurora’s glow,
As Willie’s car went dashing
By temple portico;
By statued streets that rambled
From petrol’s stench and hiss;
And shouting throngs that scrambled
Round the Acropolis
The market first he raided,
Bought fresh and select;
Gasped as small boys paraded
Salt Attic intellect;
Demetrius was clearing
The fag ends of the week,
No Stinking Fish appearing
On public barrows Greek.
Bill learned all favored greatly
In the Academies,
From jar to column stately,
Their home made industries;
From barber’s-boy to Plato
They banned the alien sleek,
First plank in each free State, “Oh!
Let Greece be white—and Greek !”
Olympic games—with side or»,
Dude-like, Jjill nobly stood

The white-robed multitude.

When all illusions fair are gone,
What keeps us still alive ?
What mocking devil lures us on
To suffer and to strive ?
Why should it fill us with despair
To watch the fading light ?
Was ever any day so fair
That we should dread the night ?
Sorrow and Joy came in the past—
Joy was a fickle bride,
But Sorrow, faithful to the last,
Stays ever at my side.
The brightest of my days are spent,
And yet I wait to see
The Master of the Dark Event
Turn dusk to dawn for me.
And still with foolish, eager eyes—
A true and bitter jest—
I watch to see the sun arise
Resplendent—in the west.
She lures us onward in the race,
Though we have knife and rope,
A devil with an angel’s face—
The devil men call Hope.

How to Address Betters.
Correspondents to The Bulletin would oblige the paper
(and, to an extent, themselves) by taking some care as to
methods of address.
Business letters (with regard to subscriptions, advertise-
ments, etc.) should in no case be addressed to the Editor,
but to the Manager. To send them to the Editor is to
invite inattention.
It is not a good thing to address editorial letters to
anyone by name. “ The Editor, Bulletin,” is the proper
superscription for "copy." Delay, and even loss, is
sometimes caused by addressing to persons instead of
officials. The person may not be there; the official
always is.

lishers. The right to reproduce or translate any part of
the contents of this number is hereby expressly reserved by
the publishers.
The Editor will carefully read and, where practicable,
acknowledge in the “ Correspondence" column all contri-
butions submitted, whether in the form of Political,
Social, or other Articles, Verse, Short Tales or Sketches
(those dealing, with Australian subjects, and not exceeding
tivo columns in length, or, say, 3000 ivords, are specially
acceptable), Paragraphs t Letters, or Newspaper Clippings.
All communications will be regarded as strictly confi-
dential.
The Bulletin will return all unsuitable MS. when the

THURSDAY, JANUARY 18, 1906.
SOME TIRED PEOPLE AND A LOST
TERRITORY AND OTHER ITEMS.
unusual coincidence occurred yesterday on board
the E. and A. Co.’s steamer Eastern prior to that vessel’s
departure for North Australian ports, China and Japan.
Five magistrates of the Northern Territory sat in conclave
and discussed Territory affairs. These were Messrs.
Bradshaw, S. J. Henderson, Beckwith, Roberts, and
Cahill, Js.P. The consensus of opinion among them
Was adverse to the cession of the Northern Territory by
South Australia to the Commonwealth, one gentleman
remarking that a cession to the Commonwealth meant
ceding the Territory to Victoria, or at any rate to
Melbourne, Mr. Bradshaw said that the Northern Terri-
tory had never been legally included in the Australian
Commonwealth, and its name had been purposely ex-
cluded from the proclamation inaugurating Federal Aus-
tralia. It was, he said, still a fief of the British crown,
and could only be dealt with by consent of the Imperial
Government.— Obscure item in Sydney Morning Herald.
When the Australian Constitution was drawn up,
it began by stating that “Whereas the people of
New South Wales, Victoria, South Australia,
Queensland and Tasmania, humbly relying on the
blessing of Almighty God, have agreed to unite
in one indissoluble Commonwealth.” That was
the preamble and commencement of things—five
States and one pious protestation, Westralia and
the Northern Territory being left out. A little
further on Clause 111. of the Constitution en-
larged the scope of things a little by stating
It shall be lawful for the Queen ... to declare by
proclamation that... the people of New South Wales,
Victoria, South Australia, Queensland and Tasmania, and
also, if Her Majesty is satisfied that the people of Western
Australia have agreed thereto, of Western Australia shall
be united in a Federal Commonwealth, etc.
That took in one more State, for Westralia did
come in, so the Commonwealth became six States
and a devout protestation, the Northern Territory
being still left out. Finally in Clause VI. there
is this further definition :
The States shall mean such of the Colonies of New
South Wales, New Zealand, Queensland, Tasmania,
Victoria, Western Australia and South Australia, includ-
ing the Northern Territory of South Australia, as for the
time being are parts of the Commonwealth, and such
Colonies or Territories as may be admitted into or
established by the Commonwealth as States, and each of
such parts of the Commonwealth shall be called a State.
All this leaves it still a trifle uncertain whether
Australia really owns the Northern Territory, or
whether it is still British property, temporarily
attached to Australia but liable to be resumed at
any time by Britain, and filled with Chinese,
Japanese, Hindus, negroes, and all the rest of the
slop and overflow of Asia and Africa.
• * • *
The more carefully the situation is viewed, the
more doubtful it seems whether Australia legally
owns the Northern Territory. It isn’t one of the
five items which, in the preamble of the Consti-
tution, are mentioned as having joined together
‘‘humbly relying on the blessing of Almighty
(jOD to form an indissoluble Commonwealth—
d P^lh a PS, all things considered, the spectacle
of the Territory humbly relying on anything save
Joss would have been a trifle too humorous.
Again, the Territory is not one of the six items
mentioned in Clause 111., which sets forth thr.i
the Queen might proclaim half-a-dozen States as
the indissoluble Commonwealth already men-
tioned. Clause VI. certainly mentions the Terri-
tory but not much more definitely than it mentions
Maoriland ; Maoriland, though it is mentioned,
isn t part of the Commonwealth, and the Terri-
tory, which is also alluded to, may not be
either—though, again, it may. Clause VI. says
that such of the places enumerated as for the
time being are parts of the Commonwealth shall
be called “ States.” Maoriland isn’t part
of the Commonwealth, and isn’t called a
State ; the Northern Territory isn’t called a State,
and therefore it isn’t any too certain that it is
part of the Commonwealth, except in a casual and
transitory fashion. The fact that the Territory is
represented in the Australian Parliament unfortu-
nately proves nothing definite; it has also been
represented for many years in the South Aus-
tralian Parliament, yet it never belonged to South
Australia—that State only administered it on be-
half of the British Government. There has long
been a hazy understanding that the Territory
would be definitely ceded to South Australia when
the transcontinental railway was finished ; but it
never has been finished, either by South Australia
or by the Commonwealth. South Australia was
too poor, and. Federated Australia was too tired
and confused in its mind. So the position is still,
in a great measure, an unknown quantity.
* * * *
It may seem an incredible thing, yet for five
years the Australian Parliament has made no
effort at all to make certain that it owns all
Australia. For all it knows to the contrary, one-
sixth of Australia is still liable to be legally
resumed at any moment by the British Govern-
ment, to be filled with Chinese and Hindu labor
which will inevitably slop over into the adjacent
States, to be jobbed away to Jew syndicates like
those which run the Transvaal, or to be bartered
with Japan in exchange for concessions elsewhere.
It is quite possible that, all these things are liable
to happen, and Australia—White Australia !—has
made no effort to make its position secure. It
hasn’t even made a serious effort to find out what
its position is. It has reached out to grab British
Papua, a foreign region of brown savages, and
hasn’t taken the trouble to fully assure itself that it
has really grabbed its own country. Of course there
are doubts about the position, and there are
different readings of the situation ; but if it comes
f ;o i a dispute between Australia and Britain as to
whether the Territory is Commonwealth soil or
not, Britain’s reading of the case will prevail if
Britain so pleases. And it only requires a great
gold find in the Territory—a thing which, long as
it has been postponed, is still quite possible-to
set every Transvaal Hebrew battering at Britain’s
door for resumption, and concessions, and Chinese
labor. .Australia can’t afford to leave such a
matter in doubt.
* * * *
There are nine questions of paramount import-
ance in Australian politics—nine questions which,
for urgency, overshadow all others—and it is a
dreadful thing to contemplate that amid the
bustle and fuss of comparatively small matters
almost every one of these has been wholly
neglected. One of the essentials is the taking
over by the Commonwealth of all South
Australia s right, title and interest in
the Northern Territory whatever these may be
worth, and the assumption of all the Territory’s
assets and liabilities. The debt of the Territory
is a huge one in proportion to its population, but
it is a mere drop in a tank to the Commonwealth,
and it will be a mere drop in a bucket to the
Territory itself when that region is populated
as it should be. By making this liability a
debt which the Territory owes to the Federal
Treasury, the Commonwealth would at least
acquire a solid mortgage on the property, and if it
didn’t actually possess the Territory, it would at
least be the man in possession. Then it should,
with all possible speed, finish the uncompleted
transcontinental line —acquiring, if possible,
the existing line from Adelaide or Port
Augusta to Oodnadatta. This would place
it in a position to demand the definite
cession of the Territory, to make it in-
disputably a part of the Commonwealth, to
pour immigrants into it. to garrison it with a
white population, to make it a solvent and acces-
sible property, and to prepare for its admission as
a I ederal State. These proceedings would make
Australia at least partially safe; they would make
it quite certain that no part of the continent could
be legally jobbed away by some British Ministry
to Japs or syndicates. But the Territory has no
friends because nobody lives there, and it. is
nobody’s personal backyard only Australia’s
backyard. If the policy above suggested were
carried out people would live there, and conse-
quently the Territory would have friends. But
just now it is only a matter of wide Australian
patriotism— not anybody’s little job. And it is
wonderful how little interest there is, compara-
tively speaking, in a matter of wide Australian
patriotism, and how much there is in somebody’s
little job.
* * • *
There are nine questions, as already mentioned,
which The Bulletin regards as of the first im-
portance in Australian politics. They are as
follows:
. (I) The taking over of the Northern Territory with all
its assets and liabilities, and the securing of its full recog-
nition as part of the Commonwealth.
(2) The completion of the transcontinental railway to
Port Darwin, partly as a means of defence, partly so that
population may be poured into the Territory, and partly
as a means to securing the full recognition of the Terri-
tory as part of the Commonwealth.
(3) The construction of the transcontinental railway to
Perth, also for purposes of defence.
(4) A Federal graduated land-tax of so heavy a nature
that it will remorselessly break up for closer settlement
the big estates which most of the State Governments
seem afraid to deal with.
(5) A Federal immigration policy to settle the lands
thus made available.
(6) A really heavy Protective tariff—the kind of Pro-
tection that will protect—to supply work for our own
artisans and for thousands of immigrant artisans.
(7) The creation of a large, well-armed and efficient
land defence force and an efficient Australian navy, with
our own arms and ammunition factories to back them up.
(8) The taking over by the Commonwealth of the State
debts, and the establishment of a sinking fund for their
repayment. And, pending the completion of negotia-
tions for the formal taking over of the debts, the imme-
diate establishment of the sinking fund. By the adoption
of the Canadian banking system, which requires that the
banks shall hold at least 40 per cent, of their cash reserves
in Federal paper money, the Commonwealth could get
command without interest of £S,OjO,OJO or £10,000,000 in
gold. If it devoted £5,000,000 or £6,000,000 of this, and
an annual vote of even as little as £250,000 a year, and
the interest derived from those sums, to the repurchase
of State securities (whatever State securities were cheap-
est), the Australian sinking fund would be doing splendid
work even while the negotiations for taking over the
State debts were still in progress.
(9) The taking over by the Commonwealth of the State
railways and the whole business of railway construction.
• * * *
These are the urgent —the intensely urgent—
questions of Australian politics. The smallest of
them is 100 times more important than the union
label, or the miserable, petty “wrongs of New
South Wales.” But the taking over of the
Northern Territory is nobody’s affair, for hardly
anybody lives there, and the Territory’s voting
power is j ust about nil. The two transcontinental
railways excite the interest of the two thinly-
peopled States directly concerned. For the rest,
they are only a question of the defence of Aus-
tralia, and defence costs money, and the danger
still looks afar off, and all-Australian patriotism
is at a low ebb, and each State wants all
the coin it can get for its own spending,
and if there is trouble in the future—well, the
future isn't here yet. The same logic applies to
the army and navy and the ammunition and arms
factory. As for the Federal land-tax, and the im-
migration policy, and the unification of the rail-
ways, they would make a grievous bruise on the
doctrine of State flights. The taking over of the
State debts would diminish the importance of the
State Premiers and Agents-General; moreover,
one State or another might lose 2d. on the deal
through the hair of finance not being split exactly
right; and in any case the idea of paying off old
debts is contrary to Australian tradition. And
then Deakin is affable and easy-going, and
Watson is affable and “moderate,” and Reid is
uncertain and slimy and engaged in pursuit of the
anti-Socialistic spectre. And except that Isaacs
and Lyne and a few more are pursuing the ques-
tion of tariff revision with real energy, there is
hardly a single large Australian question on the
present political horizon of the Australian Parlia-
ment.
PLAIN ENGLISH.
The Baby Economics of Melbourne “Argus.”
It must not be forgotten that the Return to Australia
for wheat exported from this harvest— over £5,250,000
sterling— must come to us in goods. —Argus.
And The Bulletin replies in a sad tone of voice :
Must it really ? The Argus remark is typical of
the Superior Freetrade Paper which is fond of
dropping little bits of what it calls rudimentary
instruction in the path of the Protectionist, and
the above is one of its favorite rudiments. The
Superior Freetrade Paper always assumes that
the person who doesn’t agree with its economic
theories is very old and deaf, and requires to be
spoken to slowly in a loud voice till at last his
ancient and wrinkled countenance will light up
with the lire of sudden intelligence; or else that
he is a very young infant to be appealed to by
simple words in large type. So he is fond of lay-
ing down propositions like these
(1) The surplus goods which Australia exports must be
paid for in goods.
(2) Therefore to put Protective duties on imported
goods, and thereby hinder the foreigner sending us
manufactured products in exchange for our exports of
raw materials, is merely trying to prevent ourselves
receiving payment, &c., <stc.
(3) Consequently Protection is obviously, <Scc., &c.
And in writing this kind of stuff the Superior
1 reetrade Paper never seems to realise that it is
a glaring and obvious ass, a brother to such char-
acters in fiction as Nicholas Bottom, Dogberry,
Justice Shallow, Podsnap, and Uncle Pumble-
chook, also Mr. Willett, who kept the Maypole
Inn. Australia has a lot of raw material to export
most certainly—more than it should have, for
much of the surplus wool should be used in the
woollen factories it mostly hasn’t got, and a lot of
the wheat should be required to feed the factory
operatives it mostly doesn’t possess. The Superior
P reetrade Paper says that Australia must take
manufactured goods in return for this surplus,
and in order that it may be able to absorb these
manufactured goods it must make no serious
effort to manufacture for itself, for if it .manu-
factures for itself it won’t be able to use these
foreign goods, and therefore—no other form of
payment being possible—it must give away its
surplus wheat and wool for nothing. And the
Protectionist, not being quite such a fool, replies
that the country’s exports can be employed
thus: —
(1) In paying interest on Australia’s public and private
foreign debts, amounting to perhaps £350,000,000.
• ' 2 ' 1 1, baymg such foreign goods as it is absolutely
impossible to produce here even under the greatest tariff
encouragement. There are very few of these goods, but
still there are some.
(3) In repurchasing by degrees all the Australian State
and municipal securities, bank, insurance, mining and
company shares held in England, and in buying up all the
Australian lands held by absentees—in other words, in
getting the country out of debt. This would absorb our
surplus exports for many years.
(4) When we are out of debt and don’t know what to do
with our surplus, the surplus exports can go to buy up
foreign securities so that we may become a creditor
instead of a debtor nation for a change.
The Argus theory is that no country can get into
a state of foreign debt; all goods exported are
paid for by goods imported, and they balance each
other, and to import more than we export, and
thus pile up a great foreign liability, is im-
possible. Also the Argus holds that no country,
being in debt, can get out of debt, for exports
of goods must be paid for by imports of
goods, and to have a surplus of exports with
which to reduce the foreign debt is impossible.
There was a time when the United States listened
to just such baby talk as the Argus tells to
Australia. It was a very mild little country then,
with about 12,000,000 people and very little
prospect of getting more. It vaguely understood
that if it manufactured for itself, and thus raised
a great population, and prospered through its
manufacturing industries, it would be ruined ; for
then it wouldn’t be able to buy other countries’
manufactures, and, not being able to do that, it
would be unable to get anything at all in return
for its exported wheat and cotton, and
would have to give them away gratis. But
at last a day came when the U.S. put the Argus
baby theory in the dust-box, where it rightlv
belongs, and spoke thus : “We will still export
our surplus wheat and cotton. At the same time
we won’t take foreign manufactured goods in ex-
change, except such as we can’t produce, for we
mean to manufacture for ourselves. And we will
see what happens.” And in exchange for its
wheat and cotton, and later on in return for its
manufactured exports, the U.S. got back millions
and millions worth of its public securities. It
bought back countless millions worth of its railway
bonds, and its banking, insurance and industrial
shares. It got out of debt. Then it began to
lend money to Europe and South America, and
to become a creditor instead of a deeply mort-
gaged debtor. It acquired 60,010,000 of new popu-
lation. And in doing these things it showed

Although this side issue of the struggle for'the st™„
may seem to some people a rather small and unimpoS
detail it is m reality very much the reverse, it a
indeed, only another of the many straws, all blown in tS
same direction, which are serving to illustrate the art
trary directions in which those at the Headquarter si
t>?e.Federatmn are prepared to arrogate to themselvenk
right of interference with purely State interests, and mo
particularly with those of New South Wales. ° te
For sheer muddy ignorance or wilful misrepresen-
tation this has only been beaten once—that was
when Mr. Trickett, M.L.C., wanted NSW to
secede because the N.S.W. patent records had
gone to Melbourne (which they hadn't done) and
because the Commonwealth— which has no control
over railways—hadn’t made the railways of a
uniform gauge. The Post Office is a purely Federal
affair, not a “purely State interest” as the
unlettered lout of the News describes it. For the
first five years of the union it was provided that
separate accounts should be kept for each State
therefore during that period separate State stamps
were necessary in the purely Federal Post Office
so that the purely Federal Post Office could credit
each State with its own surplus revenue. When
the book-keeping period (which probably the
News never heard of) expires, it has always been
understood that there will be a uniform stamp
and to prevent papers like the Evening News
bellowing about “Federal extravagance” (though
they will, doubtless, bellow all the same) the
stamps must be printed in one establishment. To
keep up six printing offices, all printing the same
variety of stamp, would be ridiculous. Till
the printing business can be established at
the Federal capital it was therefore proposed to
concentrate the work where it could be done
most cheaply, and the estimate of the official
printer at Adelaide was the lowest. If there is a
“wrong’’—though where it is the Lord only
knows —it is equally a wrong to Brisbane, Sydney,
Melbourne, Hobart and Perth ; but the News, in
true Sydney fashion, sees in it a special and
exclusive injury to the poor old Ma State.
Probably the News doesn’t know that Queensland,
Victoria, Tasmania and Westralia have stamps.
One of the special joys of being a Federal Minister
is this constant criticism by papers like the News,
which seldom take the trouble to learn their
subject, but just conclude off-hand that every-
thing must be a premeditated wrong done to the
poor old Ma State.
♦
Neild on the Australian Capital.
Senator Jawbone Neild, who is apparently
learning to be a rather better Australian than he
was in the days when he helped to bring about
the N.S.W.’s Parliament’s shameless repudiation
of its original Federal bargain with the other
States, said some severe things in a recent letter
to the S.M. Herald about the silly and obnoxious
crowd which is bellowing over Sydney’s “wrongs”
and injuries. Regarding the claim that the
capital should be fixed, not according to the
wording of the Constitution, but according to the
Sydney anti-Federal crowd’s interpretation of a
memo., said to have been made secretly on a scrap
of paper by the unauthorised conference of
Premiers at Melbourne, Neild says:—
Objectionable as was the secret, unconstitutional con-
clave, and the suppression of its records; unwise and
unbusinesslike as was its fixing of a minimum distance that
should separate the Federal capital from the chief city of
Australia without providing a maximum also, it was
little short of a public crime that those responsible for
this blundering- bargain should have omitted to see that
its terms were faithfully transcribed in the Federal
Enabling Bill, before it was submitted to the British
Parliament. The Premiers’ resolution, it now appears,
stipulated for the fixing of the Federal capital at “a
reasonable distance ” from Sydney. Who was responsible
for the grave omission of this provision from the Com-
monwealth Constitution ? ... It seems impossible that
this grave omission was due to oversight. This fact
remains : The Commonwealth Constitution does not con-
tain the resolution arrived at in the secret huckstering in
Melbourne !
And the other fact remains that the people are
bound only by the Constitution which was sub-
mitted to them and which they accepted—not by
alleged memoranda or scraps of paper, said to have
been left lying about by a secret gathering of
unauthorised meddlers and discovered under sus-
picious circumstances six years afterwards. Again
Senator Neild says :
The appointment of the late Mr. Alexander Oliver, as
Koyal Commissioner by the Lyne Government, to report
upon a large number of proposed sites, resulted in the
submission of a lengthy report upon almost every one of
the possible and impossible areas which local enthusiasm
suggested. These extended from Delegate on the Vic-
torian border to Armidale cn the north. This report
was placed at the disposal of the Commonwealth Govern-
ment by the then Premier of New South Wales, Mr. John
See, and when the Federal Prime Minister inquired the
wishes of the State, he was referred to the Commissioner’s
report, with a fairly plain intimation to take his choice of
the sites therein described. Whether this was a Minis-
terial or Cabinet act does not appear, nor does it seem to
have received the endorsement of the State Parliament.
Indeed, the Legislature appears to have been singularly
quiescent about the matter until a year ago.
rou^-vr~* r ,. statement of the situation.
Ihe JN.o. W. .Parliament expressed no opinion
until the capital site was selected, and then it
began to bellow in an outrageous and uncouth
fashion about not having been consulted. Finally
to quote once more from Senator Neild : '
The New South Wales Commissioner having made report
upon the Dalgety area, and the whole cf the sites reported
upon by him having been submitted to the Federal
Government by the then Premier, Mr. John See, the suc-
ceeding Premier, Mr. Waddell, went a step further bv
the issue of a proclamation, in the Government Gazette of
J une 23,1904, reserving for the purpose of the proposed ca’pi-
ai-«rown 111 the vicinity, a reservation made while
the Bill was actually passing through the Commonwealth
lai-hament. This reservation is still in force. With two
offers of the Dalgety area, and the reservation for the
capital of all Crown lands thereabouts, and with no
adverse action by the New South Wales Parliament how
could the Parliament know that the selection of the
locality- wou.d be distasteful to New South Wales?
There is only one weak point, or rather one
serious omission, in Senator Neild’s statement of


the case. He carefully begins his account of the
circumstances at October, 1898, and the facts he
Omits are these :
That N.S.W. agreed, when it asked the other States t°
federate, that the Constitution should be legally accepted
by N.S.W. if it received a majority of vqtes, and if that
majority numbered at least 50,000 votes.
The original Constitution, drafted by the peoples
ejected representatives, which left thp Federal capital to
be fixed anywhere the Federal Parliament pleased, was
accepted by a majority in N.S. W,, and the majority in-
cluded over 70,000 votes—a huge surplus,
But the then existing N.S.W. Parliament, having no
regard for truth, honor, decency or good faith, and being
a crowd of political liars, spielers and treaty-breakers,
broke the agreement with the other States, raised the re-
quired minimum from 50,000 to 80,000 and annulled the
popular acceptance, after which Premier Reid commenced
that unauthorised and secret tinkering with the Con-
stitution which has caused all the subsequent trouble.
The Federal capital trouble, as it stands to-day,
began with the lying and ill-faith of the N.S.W.
Parliament of eight years ago, and the subsequent
happenings have arisen out of the fact that the
present State Parliament is in many ways worthy
of its shady predecessor.

Shall We Sell Our Race Purity?
It is not a happy sign of national spirit that, when
a social problem is discussed, the argument that
such and such a course will bring a little more
trade or some other material advantage is always
advanced as if it were irresistible. There are
greater things in the individual’s life than the
massing of wealth ; far greater things in a nation’s
life than the growth of riches. Yet it is very
widely assumed—especially by the Foreign-trade
newspapers —whenever a political question comes
to be discussed, that the only vital consideration
is that of £ s. d. A claim, for example, is
now being made on behalf of the Chinese for a
relaxation of the laws practically prohibiting
their entry into the Commonwealth, and the
arguments put forward on their behalf as irre-
sistible amount to this :
That by making this concession to the Chinese, Aus-
tralia will be able to sell more wool and meat.
That Australia could make £BOO,OOO a year by acting as
Mrs. Todoers to Chinese students anxious to learn the
white man’s civilisation so that they may turn its
weapons against the white race.
For these benefits Australia is asked to allow free
entry to all Chinese students, merchants and
educated men; and to permit Chinese now resi-
dent in Australia to import their wives and
children —or somebody else’s wives and children,
as the case might be. In short, the Common-
wealth is urged to make so radical a change in its
policy as to destroy for ever the White Australia
ideal, and affix permanently the stain of Asiatic
blood on our race type. And all for a little more
trade and the board-money of some thousands of
Chinese students ! So far as The Bulletin’s
voice goes, not for millions of money and
millions of Chinese lodgers to assume lodgers’
privileges in our homes. Let us be poor
and honest, if we can’t be rich and honest;
pure in blood if scanty in purse, rather
than defiled in blood and fat in wealth. Race
purity is worth more than any boarding-house
gains or profits on pelts and butter. And the
only way to preserve race purity is to keep the
Asiatic and the negro and the Kanaka out —right
out. America has proved that; in spite of
a savage system of repression, which reaches its
culminating point in roasting negroes at the stake,
the black man can’t be prevented from brewing
his blood with the white man’s. We want no
racial degradation here. Nor. do we want to
smell roast nigger. Not for millions ! And we
do not even want to be a nation of hash-houses,
acting as Mrs. Todgers and her serf Mary Ann
to Chinese students.
A Maoriland Legend.
“0.”: The recent dismissal by the Maoriland
Government of the Post Office clerks implicated
in the Skddon voucher rumpus raises the question
as to whether a civil servant should be loyal to his
departmental chiefs, or to the interests of the
public he serves. The departmental chief is only
another servant, and it is Parliament and the
people it represents who are the real employers.
The three clerks supplied information to a mem-
ber of Parliament about an alleged voucher for a
payment to a son of Premier Seddon, and the
member asked questions in the House of Repre-
sentatives which started one of the boss rows of
Sei>don’s stormy career. The clerks said they
had seen the voucher, but they were the only
people who admitted having seen it. A voucher
for one Sneddon was brought to light, but whether
Sneddon was ever produced in the flesh this de-
ponent knoweth not. The Auditor-General
did his level best, but could find no trace
of that voucher, and when Parliament itself took
a hand it also failed to find any trace of the docu-
ment. So Premier Seddon and his son scored
heavily. Now Minister Joe Ward has dismissed
the three officers. The invisibility of the voucher
has convinced most people that the thing was an
invention of the Cold Tea crowd, and while
admitting that the Cold Tea crowd is just about
capable of doing anything, it must not be sup-
posed that a Government department is any more
scrupulous than the men who run it. I worked
for some years in a Maoriland Government
department, and saw some curious things
done therein. In my day, the civil servant
always stuck to the chief—it paid, and
sometimes the chief paid too. A man came
into our department, and because he was the
nephew of a mighty politician he soared over the
heads of men of greater ability and experience.
In six months he found himself where only the
brightest and brainiest found themselves in four
years, and where it took the rank and file sixty
years to reach. Then one day he made the unpar-
donable blunder. The acting-chief called him
into his presence. “ Will you resign ?” asked the
acting-chief. “No,” said the culprit. “Then
you are dismissed. I wish you better luck in your
next venture. Good afternoon ! ” But the in-
fluential young man fought for his billet. “You
pitchforked me too high,” he pleaded. “ I did not
want to be placed where my experience did not
justify me. Neither did my uncle wish it. I wrote to
you, or rather to the Chief himself, that I would
be safer lower down, and my own immediate chief
also recommended I should be put where I couldn’t
fall off and hurt myself. You took no notice, and
now that the inevitable has happened through
your office taking no notice, you sack me ! I pro-
test ! It is too bad ; I shall appeal to my uncle,”
etc., etc. Said the acting-chief: “You’resacked.”
Then the influential uncle took a hand. The
Government of the day was weak, and it appointed
a Select Committee, or something, to inquire into
the matter and ascertain if the young man
had asked to be placed where he couldn’t fall
off. It was a committee of strong men, and
it fell on the office of that acting-chief, and asked
him questions in a cold aggressive voice. Also it
inspected his re<*ord-book with startling sudden-
ness and searched his records and files. It found
nothing. The sworn statements of the dismissed
officer and his immediate superior that they had
represented his unfitness for the position he held
were declared to be either lies or imagination.
The record-book contained entries dating ha? ’
nearly three years, and in it there was
not one word of the letters which the two
officers had sworn to writing and forwarding. And
yet they told the truth. Their letters had been
burped, and the record book had been copied out
afresh into a new volume—three men who could
be relied upon to stick to the acting-chief working
three shifts day and night to get it done. They
were fair penmen, and they rang amazing changes
on their handwriting. Also, to prevent the pale-
blue tint of newly-written ink giving the show
away if the committee arrived too soon, the new
book was written in with Indian ink, which was
black as black could be from the start. The only
remark the committeemen made was to compli-
ment the record clerks on the beautiful way the
book was kept—its cleanness hit them where they
lived, but never raised a suspicion in their great
thick heads.

Stamps.
It is to be hoped that the Australian Government
will think better of the foolish proposal to put the
upper part of Edward YII. on its stamps. It
won’t do Edward VII. the least good to have his
head on the stamps, and it won’t give him a
passing semblance of satisfaction, because he is so
accustomed to seeing his head on stamps and coins
that the novelty of it has long departed. It
won’t even make him feel that Australia is in the
least degree more loyal than it was before, because
he is so used to his own head that it has ceased to
excite emotion in his breast. On the other hand,
it will aggravate his son, who is an enthusiastic
stamp collector, and who must be deadly tired of
making collections of Pa’s countenance. Most
important of all, however, the putting of Pa’s
countenance on the Australian stamps will be a,
pathetic throwing away of valuable advertise-
ment. It is agreed on all hands that Australia
requires advertisement, and it can get it
in no cheaper way than by its stamps.
A series of large scenic stamps like
those of Tasmania, each denomination with a
separate view on it, would carry a cheap and
useful advt. of this country to every place that
has a rnail service the wide world over. The
rocky gates of Sydney harbor viewed from out-
side, the Hawkesbury River, the Barron Falls in
Queensland, the Gippsland Lakes and the Buffalo
Lake in Victoria, Mount Wellington and the.
Derwent River in Tasmania, Circular Quay,
Sydney, with its maze of trams, the long vistas of
Bourke-street, Melbourne, and King William-
street, Adelaide, and patches of the Swan River
at Perth—these on our stamps would help to
persuade people everywhere that Australia is a
country worth living in. They would at least
cause people to take a second look, and to
remember that there is such a place as Australia.
On the other hand, the head of Edward VII.
will do nothing to advertise this country, nor will.
it make anyone remember its existence. It will
simply make Australia one more item iij the
great heap of the ordinary, the commonplace, and
the flat and miserable.
Concerning Busted Securities.
The Australian Postmaster-General has two wire-
less-telegraph agents knocking at his door these
days— Hamilton, of the International Co., and
Walker, of the Marconi Co. —and Austin Chap-
man thinks of putting them in the way of showing
what can be done to connect Australia, Tasmania,
and Maoriland. “But,” says he, “there are
pecuniary objections, because the Commonwealth
is financially interested in the cable service to
Maoriland and Tasmania.” Still, as the Govern-
ment sees, that obstacle must be clambered
over somehow if the new method is Ahead
of the old. And just at this point Aus-
tralia may begin to suspect what a siriking
fund is good for. The Commonwealth States
owe £234,000,000 in public debt, and Where
this is represented by anything at all it is repre-
sented by railways that are liable to be bumped
out by new forms of traction and carriage ; and
by tramways that are liable to be run off by better
sorts of tramway ; and by telegraph systems that
are liable to be knocked out by some new develop-
ment in electrical science. No. 1 engine, bought
50 years ago by N.S. Wales, was exhibited the
other day as a curiosity; and the tram-cars
that were bought with borrowed money at a
very much later date, and were run along
King-street, were put up for sale last year
for what they would fetch. The Department
didn’t know what they were any good for, but it
thought they might do for hen-houses or something
of the kind ; anyhow, it knew that, so far as the
State was concerned, they were no longer of any
substantial value. Now the wireless-telegraph
men come along, and the Postmaster-General has
doubts about some more assets. In this case, no
doubt, as the Commonwealth has protected itself
by giving the people a monopoly in all forms of
telegraphy, it might decline to make scrap-metal
of its existing telegraph lines and refuse to deal
at all with the newcomers ; but if the new system
is ahead of the old, such a decision would simply
handicap Australia in competition with other
peoples who would use the better system. In
industry and commerce, as every experienced man
knows, the only possible way to keep ahead in
the race is by ruthlessly “scrapping” old
machinery and appliances and using the newest
and most improved ; and the only way in which
that can be done is by providing a sinking fund
to wipe out the capital cost of a machine or an
appliance; and the wiping-out process ought to
start as soon as the tool is bought. If it isn’t,
then the time comes when the concern (State,
co., or individual) finds itself either struggling
along with out-of-date appliances or, if it has
bought the new ones, loaded with interest on two
lots of tools, only one of which is earning anything;
and that means either dear goods and services, or
low wages, or both. If wireless telegraphy were
introduced now, Australia wouldn’t get the bene-
fit of it, because even though it absolutely dis-
carded the telegraph lines, &c., it would still have
to pay interest on the money the States borrowed
to build them with- But if there had been a sink-
ing fund to wipe out that debt, then the new sys-
tem would only have to pay interest on its own
small capital cost; and the result would be cheaper
communication than can at present be thought of.
Every well-conducted business concern provides
for this writing-down process (a sinking fund is a
writing-down process put in another way); it is
only very foolish States that have tried to pull
through without it—very foolish States deluded
by papers that mouth moth-eaten remarks concern-
ing “great natural resources” and “permanent
and reproductive undertakings.”
The Curious Firm of Bent and Co.
Bulky Bent, the Victorian Premier, appears to
have been convicted of further political jobbery
re the appointment of Government “commercial
agents” in general, and the selection of one J. M.
Sinclair in particular, Sinclair being the
person who formerly figured as the salaried guide,
philosopher and friend in London of the Vic.
butter export trade. For some inscrutable reason,
Bent is bent on paying Sinclair a salary of
£750 a year to “look after” Australian commerce
with S’Africa or Asia. In the first place it was
announced that Asia was calling for Sinclair to
act as assistant agent to another favored iridi-
vidual, named Levien, who will also promote
commerce on a salary of £750 a year and expenses,
but owing to a loud protest from Melbourne Age,
the appointment of Sinclair underwent a sudden
change, and he is now understood to be’
destined for S’Africa. The exact locality of
fefs billet, or of any other “commercial agent’s ”
billet, is a matter of no interest to the taxpayer
seeing that Victoria can derive no benefit from the
payment of these people’s salaries. The
Australian State Governments are not trading
concerns. The States, until the Commonwealth
tariff came into operation, were as commercially
foreign to one another as though oceans divided
them, nevertheless no Vic. Premier ever had the
audacity to appoint an agent at £750 a year to
push Melbourne trade with Sydney. The pro-
ceeding would have been too ridiculous. Sinclair
passing himself off as Bent’s bagman (without a
bag) in S’Africa, Japan, Algiers, or the Holy
Land, will be equally absurd. A Melbourne mer-
chant speaks of the “commercial agent” as a
standing joke:—
On several occasions the New South Wales and Maori-
land representatives have afforded much amusement to
the merchants engaged in the Asiatic trade by communi-
cating to their respective Governments at great expense
information with regard to the special requirements of
the Asiatic markets long after the contracts had been
signed and the goods actually despatched. Whatever the
qualifications of the two gentlemen selected may be, they
will find on arrival in the main Asiatic centres that they
will be entirely dependent for information on the Euro-
pean merchants who are established there. Their princi-
pal occupation will be to make themselves agreeable at
the palatial clubs and take part in the social life of the
various cities. Their usefulness to Australia will com-
mence and end there. Outside of commercial circles in
large Asiatic cities the representatives of the Government
will never be known. The people generally will have
no knowledge of their existence. As advertisers of Aus-
tralia they will be absolutely useless. I notice that the
produce which Mr. Bent informed your reporter would
be pushed by the commercial agents was butter, cheese,
potatoes, wheat, wool, frozen meat, horses, hay, chaff and
leather. As a matter of fact, all that produce and much
more is being pushed in the markets of Asia already.
By way of commentary on these remarks, does
anybody remember anything tangible that has
come from the appointment of commercial agents
—not merely vague inquiries about a ton of lead
or a dray-load of wattle-bark or a bag of feathers,
but some real business, and enough of it to justify
the commercial agents’ salary ? And in view of
the shameful way in which Australian products
are neglected in Australia, how would it be if
Bent stationed his Victorian commercial agent in
Melbourne instead of in Asia or Africa ?

The Syrian.
“ Antis” about an undesirable race :
Within the borders of N.S.W. there are three non-
fusible Asiatic races —the Chinese, the Indian, and the
Syrian. The Chinese and his ways are familiar to every-
one ; the Indian is known to all by sight at least; but of
the Syrian, less distinctive in personal appearance and
unmarked by peculiar dress, few have any clear knowledge.
As the name implies (for the original misnomer
“ Assyrian ” has long been dropped) he comes from Syria,
and his native tongue is Arabic. He is a Christian—of
sorts—belonging to the Maronite Church, which, though
more closely resembling the Greek form, now acknow-
ledges the supremacy of the Pope, while still preserving,
as it always has done, its own forms and its own rulers.
Though an Asiatic the Syrian is certainly white, being
much of the complexion of the Southern European, with
dark hair and eyes and olive skin. He is usually a largish
man, long-bodied, loose-bellied, early inclining to corpu-
lence, with the short and generally bowed legs of the
Semitic Asiatic. His physiognomy is mostly a predatory
nose, two heavy-lidded eyes, and a full under-lip.
He is a born trader, and will do nothing involving any
physical exertion, preferring to lounge lazily all day
behind a counter, bargaining volubly over each sale,
though it be no bigger than a tooth-brush. He says that
he came to this country to find religious freedom, but
whether that be true or not, he also came to make money,
and he succeeds. Unlike the Chinese and the Indian,
who leave their women behind them, intending to return
when they have earned a competence, the Syrian brings
his family with him, and intends to stay. He does not,
marry or mix with the European, and, though he makes'
money, his standard of living does not rise ; and, though
the men dress well, their homes and shops are untidy and
squalid.
The Syrian is too frightened of work to be often found
carrying a pack, but he is deeply concerned in the hawk-
ing business, having gathered into his hands almost a
monopoly of the trade of supplying the Indians, who
traverse the country districts. He advances them goods
on credit, and is paid as the goods are sold. As the
Indians are rarely dishonest, the losses are not great, and
there is a big margin of profit to cover possibilities. The
wide use of the parcel post of late years has made big in-
roads on hawking profits, and now firms of Syrians have
established stores in many country towns, where they
have gained the whole-hearted hatred of their European
rivals. They are inveterate cutters of prices, preferring
to sell at cost rather than lose a sale.
The Syrian generally has no sense whatever of commer-
cial morality, and heavy losses through giving him credit
have caused the name of Syrian to stink in the nostrils of
many Sydney wholesalers. So keen was the feeling that
at one time there was an attempt to make an arrange-
ment among the warehouses to absolutely refuse all
Syrian business, except for spot cash. It may be noted
in contra-distinction that the Chinese, with all their faults,
bear an excellent reputation for honesty in trading.
The Syrians have been quick to perceive the distrust they
arouse, and many have anglicised their own names, or
else adopted a common European one. The writer has
met M‘Guires whose hooked noses, swarthy complexions
and strange accent would have sent Saint Patrick into a
fit.
The men of the better class are usually fairly educated,
speaking sometimes two or three languages in addition
to their native Arabic. This is owing to the fact that, in
their own country, languages are a necessity for business
purposes. Many of them have grown very wealthy, and
at the present time there are practically no poor among
them. A few years ago they erected a substantial brick
church in Elizabeth-street, Sydney, which was opened
under the auspices of Cardinal Moran. Their priests—
fat, luxuriant-bearded, black beetles of men—are familiar
figures to suburban housewives, who are constantly
bothered for contributions. As they are extremely perti-
nacious, a small sum is usually donated to get them off
the premises.
A word as to the women. When young, a bright color
glow'ing through the dark skin often renders them attrac-
tive looking, in spite of their coarse features. Occa-
sionally a truly beautiful face may be seen, but all age
quickly, and at no time do they possess a semblance in
figure to anything more graceful than a sack of potatoes.
The old women are hideous witches.
Some of the women, usually the aged and ugly, do a
little hawking, with baskets of cheap rubbish. They will
never take “No ” for an answer, and when they cannot
make a sale they become abusive.
The Syrian type is a sordid one, and its only ideal is
money; in pursuit of that object it is patient and
tenacious, sometimes blustering, sometimes cringing, but
usually a liar devoid of shame. The Syrian is a man who
does not, and never will, do any useful or productive
work, but will always remain what he now is—a parasite
and a drone. And if there be anyone still of the opinion
that the Syrian is a fit subject for gentle treatment under
the Aliens Act, a little time spent in the back lanes of a
Syrian quarter will be more effectual proof to the con-
trary than any argument.

The Immigration Act.
A champ,ON of colored labor for Australia, no
matter how ignorant his argument and absurd his
contention, can always be sure of a sympathetic
tar in Sydney Telegraph office. That newspaper,
in pursuance of its vain ambition to detach the
support of the wealthy classes from the Sydney
Morning Herald, is prepared,to go to any length
in opposition to the democratic aspirations of the
Australian people. A typical example of this is
given by the welcome last week to a letter from
an anonymous correspondent on Immigration.
This writer, who concealed' his identity behind a
tag of Latin, arrived by a perfectly logical series
of arguments to the conclusion that the Immigra-
tion Restriction Act offers these alternatives :
Either the official has an absolute right of applying the
test in whatever European tongue he has a mind to
choose, or else the right of choice rests absolutely with
the immigrant. This do I particularly wish to emphasise
—the right of choice must rest with one of the two
parties ; it must always rest with the same party, and in
the nature of things it must rest with that party to the
exclusion of the other. The Act does not limit the choice
of him who has the right of choosing ; the right of choice
then is absolute, so that whichever party possesses it,
officer or immigrant, can choose whatever European lan-
guage he pleases.
And, after examining this accurate statement, he
decides that the first alternative is absurd because
It means that every person who comes here is poten-
tially a “prohibited immigrant,” every stranger to our
shores being entirely at the mercy of one irresponsible
civil servant who claims the omnipotence to make, by a
simple contrivance, “prohibited immigrants” of-all he
chooses. Such claims may seem arrogant, tyrannical,
illegal—and they are so. v >
Therefore the second alternative is the correct one,
and the immigrant can choose his own language
test. The fallacy of the process by which this
result is arrived at is a common subject of demon-
stration in infants’ logic schools. Two and two
make four, therefore two eggs and two hens make
four chickens, and two shillings and twopence
make four sovereigns. They may appear to do
so, if you make a whole series of false assumptions.
The Immigration Act says that an immigration
officer may put any European language test
to any immigrant. Therefore, if you presume
that alb immigrants will go before the One
officer, that that officer will be quite irresponsible
and will allow' no guidance from the wishes of
Government or Parliament of the country; and
that, further, that officer will be a congenital
idiot, then all immigrants may be prohibited.
Which is absurd ; therefore the Act, can’t mean
that, and must'mean that the immigrant has the
right to choose his own test. Q.E.D. Sydney
Telegraph, with courageous stupidity, endorses
that, arid in an editorial, the Eriglish of which is
as weak as the argument, states :
If the Act is to be construed in the light of the obvious
intention of the Legislature which enacted it, therefore
(s£cj the right of selecting the test language within the
prescribed limit must rest with the immigrant.
Of course, all that is sheer nonsense. The
“obvious intention’’ of the Legislature was to
keep out colored aliens. Australia had been
warned by the Imperial Government that it would
not be allowed to do that directly, and was forced
therefore to the subterfuge (suggested by Mr.
Chamberlain and previously adopted by the
Natal Government and by Mr. Reid in N.S.
Wales) of a language test. Since it was known
that many colored aliens know English, but it
was still desired to keep them out; and that many
desirable Europeans do not know English yet it
was the intention to admit them; the language
test was fixed to be in any European tongue, at
the discretion of the Government expressed through
its immigration officer. There was no shadow of
a doubt about this purpose, to have power to keep
out the educated Asiatic or Negro. It is expressed
in every word of the Act and was announced in
every speech of the debates upon the Bill.
Our Harmless Amy.
A man who knows writes from Melbourne :
The British Army Council has justified the first year of
its existence by producing, after immense exertion, a
coat-of-arms for itself and a new button for the army, and
the Australian Military Board, a mild imitation of the
British concern, after nine months of labor, has brought
forth a new “ Army List ” and “Revised Regulations.”
In spare mordents it has, by a series of petty decisions, so
befogged the various State military staffs that they,
metaphorically, “ dunno where they are.”
Of all objects of scorn the most despicable to an Aus-
tralian is a “ messer.” Hutton, right or wrong, had a
definite object in view, did his best to get there, and saw
that all ranks marched with him. But the aim of the
Board is past guessing. Its safety lies, as a great Judge
once said of a corporation, in the fact that it has no body
to be kicked and no soul to be damned, and the members
shelter themselves behind each other, backing the most
trivial decisions by the whole joint authority, of the
Board.
Half of the permanent officers, on whom rests the
responsibility for the training of the citizen forges, are
either ignorant of their work, or just putting in the
regulation Government stroke. True, they can “ Damn ”
very smartly a ( subordinate—who dare not talk back —at
a trumpery show parade ; but smartness on parade is only
the most superficial requirement of an officer. Real
scientific knowledge can only come as the result of work.
Tuft-hunting is rampant. A puppy who apes the
English dude, and whose father is a squatter, is- given a
commission in preference to- another decent fellow, who
does not turn up his pants, and who has, unfortunately
for himself, served in the ranks. Yet a veteran English
volunteer once said “The busiest man makes the best
officer ”; and it is very true that the man who has
nothing to do never has any time to spare to learn
soldiering.
The Military Board informed Parliament the other day
that it was all nonsense to say that Australia had but
one rifle for 10 men ; and that there were 60,000 rifles in
the Commonwealth. Perhaps my arithmetic is wrong,
but if, in the event of invasion, Australia had to arm
its whole male population—of whom over 750,000 are
of the soldier’s age—it is not clear that there would
be even one rifle for ten men. Anyhow, the Board can
only lend the rifle club men one magazine rifle for every
ten members, <in addition to the second-rate Martim-
Enfield rifles, which no sensible rifleman will use. And
rifles do not last for ever, especially the barrels. How
many of the 60,000 are worn out, and not fit for use ?
Ask the militia infantry regiments in New South Wales,
whose first issue, in 1898, is now unfit for accurate shoot-
ing. The Board will not permit our volunteers to pur-
chase Government rifles, because the stock is so small.
Parliament should insist on knowing what it has got,
what is still fit for service, and what stock of material is in
hand to replace broken and worn-out parts. How
great is the necessity for a local arms factory !
The untutored African savage thought, when he loaded
up his old elephant gun with a double handful of scrap
iron, that the greater the charge the more extensive would
be the slaughter of his enemies. Following a misguided
enthusiasm on the same lines -Australian cartridges
seem to occasionally contain more than one bullet, and
burst Government rifles that can ill be spared. Hence
the withdrawal from use of a large portion of our Com-
paratively small stock of ammunition. A million rounds
sounds large, and the Military Board makes the most of it,
but a million rounds among 10,000 rifles means but. 100
rounds each—a fraction of what is-spent in a single cam-
paign. Let Parliament again ask, how many rounds we
have, how many different brands are comprised in the
total, and how much ■ has been withdrawn from use.
Then ask how many reliable rounds Australia has for its
meagre stock of mostly worn-out rifles, and how many per
head of its fighting men would have no rifles.
The execution of military works and rifle ranges costs
twice and three times as much as> need be. It is so
arranged by departmental jealousy and crass stupidity,
that five different Government departments must be in
travail to produce the repair of a rifle range at the cost of
a ten pound note. It is often “ necessary ” for skilled
representatives of three of these departments in turn to
visit the scene of operations, maybe 2QO miles from
Sydney, to report and write minutes. The job is elabor-
ately advertised in the Government Gazette and ten-
dered for by a metropolitan contractor, who has to make
travelling expenses and profits. Trifling jobs, worth a
ten-pound note to a local man, result in a £25 or £3O

contract. Months elapse from start to finish instead of
days, and the result, in some cases, has been a rifle-range
without targ'ets (forgotten)—about as useful as a fireplace
without a chimney.
The officers of our Defence Force have been taxed many
hundred pounds and the Government many thousands by
the ridiculous requirements of our “ Dress Regulations.
These have a habit of changing. Generals and Boards
all take a turn at ordering new things, pretty and other-
wise, at some one else’s expense—scarlet, blue and
kharki, cloth, serge and drill, gold, silver, brass and bronze,
feathers and rosettes, aiguilettes and breast-lines. Does
the fate of Australia depend on these? Certainly the
custom of nations requires that fighting men should
wear uniform, but the simplest garments suffice for this,
so long as they differ from the usual attire of the non-
fighting population. Now we see uniforms being built of
rotten material, the labor expended being two-thirds to
three-quarters of the total cost, and the result falling
apart in a few months. Invisibility, so strongly insisted
on in late wars, has been lost sight of, and money is still
being wasted on shiny buttons, gold lace, and other use-
less fal-lals. Can’t Australians become patriots without
being popinjays?
The organisation framed by Hutton is no whit further
advanced than when he left us. A mobilisation of the
present Defence Force —20,000 only without the un-
organised riflemen—would find regiments without food
or hospitals as soon as they moved from the towns and
railways, and guns without ammunition.
Australia needs a common-sense army, without frills
and foolishness —an army with a definite aim. But Aus-
tralia will hardly get such from any general, nor from any
military board. The cobwebs must be cleared from our
vision. Nothing will meet the case but a committee of
able citizens, unconnected with any military organisation,
to deliberate freely and fully, to call and hear all avail-
able evidence, military or otherwise, and decide how
much defence Australia needs, and the best way to get it.

The Fall of Mr. Fell.
David Fell, M.L.A., writes as follows :
Is there any special reason why I should be called upon
to make you my political Father. Confessor for any alleged
political errors, geographical or otherwise, that I may be
accused of? Your political idiosyncrasies I cannot pre-
tend to follow, any more than I do Mr. Carruthers’ ; you
appla " 4 me when I fall upon that gentleman ; you censure
me ft not “blowing” upon the assets of New South
Wales n my recent criticism upon the State Budget ;
and yon designate me as “one of the political fallen”
and alb ge that I am assisting the anti-Federal brigade,
for not ratting” on the question of the N.S.W. Capital
site ; i 4 finally, after all those kind views, you
invite u , in order that my political reputation
for horn. -,y will not be damaged, to confess an
error. If t is a fact (and The Bulletin says it is) that
Dalgety is a few miles nearer to Sydney than to Mel-
bourne, then I must be wrong. My error can either be
put down to a deliberate attempt to mislead, geographi-
cal ignorance, or a typographical error in copying or
something else ; choose whichever you like. I am not
worrying about damaging my political character, and I
hope you won’t. Whatever statements en passant may
have occurred in my interview with the Daily Telegraph,
it does not affect the main question. Clause 125 in the
Federation Enabling Act, in my opinion, embraces a
special contract with the citizens of N.S.W., viz.,
that the Federal capital shall be in their State,
and also that they shall have the privilege of grant-
ing the territory (which has not yet been done by the
State Parliament so far as Dalgety is concerned)
and, after the territory is granted and accepted, the
Commonwealth Parliament may fix the seat of Government,
or the capital site, within the territory so granted. As a
representative of New South Wales I intend to record my
vote in this case, in accordance with what appears to me
to be a purely business contract, even at the risk of being
accused of “ Provincialism” or of being a “Secessionist.”
In view of your C.O.D. principles, one would have thought
that you would have advocated the postponement of the
erection of the Federal Capital, and advocated that the
constitution might be altered to allow Sydney to have a
turn with the seat of Government, as the erection of a
capital, and the means of access thereto (especially to
Dalgety) would mean the expenditure of several millions
of money, of which N.S. W. taxpayers would have to bear
their share.
If you must have copy, and will insist on digging me
out of “ political oblivion,” please do not be too hyper-
critical, and be good enough to give me time to “ cut my
political teeth.”
I have little time to reply to all the nice and nasty
things said about me politically, but as your articles have
a “political paternal” tendency, I offer the above so as
not to appear ungrateful or discourteous.
It is remarkable how weighty and serious the
politician is when he is propping up his case with
a very incorrect statement, and how light and airy
he is when he is bowled out. When Mr. Fell
was advancing as a reason against the Dalgety site
that the proposed capital, owing to its geographi-
cal position, would be a mere appanage of Mel-
bourne, ho put down the alleged fact as if it were
as serious as a ton of lead. When it is pointed
out on the evidence of the map and of the
N.S. Wales State official who reported on
capital sites that this fiction was exploded
long since (Home Secretary Dugald Thomson
also exploded it a year ago), Mr. Fell seems to
regard the issue of incorrect information to support
his provincial view of things as a rather happy
jest. It 'isn’t a ton of lead now, but just a
’ feather, and it is a thing of no importance and a
mere side issue. As regards Mr. Fell’s view
that N.S.W. must grant a site before the Aus-
tralian Parliament can fix the capital, it is
only fair to remember that the Australian
Government took the same view until the
N.S.W. Government knocked that yiew out of it.
In a lengthy correspondence Prime Minister
Barton urged the N.S.W. Government to offer a
site, or some sites. The N.S.W. Government
held that this was none of its business. All it
would do was to “reserve” and report on certain
sites, and the Australian Parliament, taking this
as an offer (it was the only offer it could get), and
being told by certain Sydney papers that its delay
in fixing the Federal capital was part of a con-
spiracy to keep the capital in Melbourne, accepted
one of the sites reserved and favorably reported
on.. Now it seems that—
(l) It should not have believed the N.S.W. Premier
when he held that it was no part of the State’s business
to offer a site, and
(2) It should have waited, despite all the denunciations
to the effect that its delay was part of a base device to
keep the capital in Melbourne, till some N.S.W. Premier
arose who thought differently from John See on this
matter.
The trouble really seems to be that the Australian
Government hadn’t the gift of prophecy, and
didn't know that Carruthers was going to be
Premier of N.S.W. and that he would start
a new policy. The anti-Federal crowd in
N.S.W. simply denounces the Australian Govern-
ment for taking the N.S.W. Government at its
word, and fancying the State’s policy had some
kind of consistency about it.
+.. :
“ H. Drummond ” (who is in the law) writes about
a complication :
The legal profession in N.S.W. has just awakened to
find itself in an awful fix over the old-time question of
dower. It seems that by the old Common Law a wife
was entitled to a life estate in one-third of the rents and
profits arising from her husband’s real estate, whether he
had parted with it in his lifetime or still held it at the
time of his death. Then the Legislature in 1837 came
along with an Act which said that the wife was not going
to get any dower if the husband disposed of his property in
his lifetime or by his will. This left the wife in the posi-
tion of still getting her dower if her husband died with-
out making a will, and in 1890 the Probate Act was
passed by which it was enacted that if the husband died
and made no will the wife should not have any dower —a
certain part of the estate being put aside for her benefit.
This effectually did away with the question of dower
altogether, and the profession felt very thankful for it.
But in 1901, Parliament thought it would do the thing
thoroughly. The M.P.’s simply said, “ There is no law of
dower in N.S.W., so we will abolish the old Dower Act of
1837.” So they abolished it without knowing that the gun
was loaded, for its abolition simply brought things back to
the old Common Law except as it was altered by the Pro-
bate Act. And this Act has been in force nearly six years
and no shark discovered it till last week. Now the
whole swarm of them stand in the position that they
are at present liable to some millions in damages for all
the bad titles they have passed during the last six years.
And when Parliament meets there will be a wild rush to
get a Validating Bill through, and the lawyers are
beginning to be afraid already that they will not get it
through so easily, because, as this complicated law now
stands, the husband cannot make a will and dispossess his
wife of everything—the very thing that Griffith was
trying for only last session. Anyhow a man can die now
and leave no will, and his wife will get no dower; but if
he dies and leaves Carruthers a fortune to build up a
surplus, Carruthers would have to hand over to the
widow a third of the income as long as she lived.

Melbourne magistrates have a remarkable tender-
ness for the wife-beater and the man who
habitually forgets to support his family. On one
day recently three wives in three different Mel-
bourne suburbs asked for protection. One said
that for 17 years she had been married to a
creature who fed her on bread, water, and kicks ;
clothed her in rags ; and when she murmured —
shrilly, no doubt—threw her into the street. The
magistrates—one of them a P.M., the rest honorary
—told her to leave him and sue for maintenance.
They then dismissed the case. Another husband
was sued for maintenance for a wife and five
children. His family for the last month had been
living on the charity of a benevolent society and
a church. The husband was a gaidener, and had
been in constant work for 18 months past, so the
Bench ordered him to pay 10s. a week to keep his
family of six—ls. Bd. per week each. It also
allowed him to appeal against the decision. The
third case was the worst of the lot. A Fitzroy
husband kicked and punched his wife into insen-
sibility. A constable interfered, but did not lock
the man up. The Bench spoke firmly to the hus-
band, and fined him 40s. It seems about time
that Thomas Bent, who is fond of looking into
things, looked into the state of the law regarding
wife-beaters. There is no doubt about the efficacy
of the law in providing punishment for the small
thin clerk who steals a postal order for a few
shillings. There's half-a-year’s imprisonment wait-
ing for him, or for the man who breaks a window,
or enters a dwelling, or —worst crime of all—is
found by night in a warehouse without lawful
excuse. All these are provided for. They
infringe the sacred rights of proputty. But as for
wife-beaters and cliildren-starvers—the law hardly
seems to know whether it disapproves of them or
not.
Premier Bent and Minister Murray wandered
during the holidays over a good portion of the
plains of western Victoria, south of Ballarat.
They rode, or rather flew, in the State motor-
car, whose snorts sent the sheep scattering for
miles, and scared several wild ducks and a swan
to death. The car never ran over anyone, for the
excellent reason that there was no one to run over.
The writer drove for 27 miles along some of the
same country two days previously, and the only
human beings he saw on the trip were two men in
a motor-car, and a Chinaman on foot. Yet there
are huge stretches of these plains which are well
fitted for closer settlement. Thousands of acres
will grow wheat or potatoes, and there is room
for a thousand small sheep-farmers. The object
of the Premier’s visit was to see whether a rail-
way through the plains would be justified. At
present there are large areas under wheat at both
Lake Bolac and Nerrin Nerrin; but these places
are 30 or 40 miles away from a railway—a fact
which cuts a lot of the profit off the wheat. The
Premier, when his head could be seen through the
dust of the motor-car, seemed to be impressed
with the capabilities of the district, but he was also
impressed with the fact that a railway would add
enormously to the value of the big stations through
which it passed, and he inquired frequently how
much the owners of the stations would given him
to make the railway. Thomas the Fat (and
Shrewd) is always making these sensible and busi-
nesslike observations; the trouble is that few of
them ever become anything more than observa-
tions. They seem to melt away and disappear
before Thomas has had time to translate them into
action.

“ Frank C.” : Before those squatters and squat-
ting company managers who are bringing out
Dr. Danysz from the Paris Pasteur Institute
are allowed to get to work inoculating our
bright Australian rabbit with some fatal
disease, the Governments had better make
sure nothing is going to break. Unless the
specific absolutely kills off all the rabbits—if
it only kills a quarter or half—it is worse than
useless ; for, in addition to leaving bunny almost
as big a plague as at present, the disease will kill
the rabbit export trade, and that is worth much
good money to Australia these days. There is a
fatality about the squatting crowd, too, and
almost everything it has introduced—including
rabbits, foxes, and prickly pear—has been a disas-
ter. Nowadays a squatter who wants to introduce
anything should be viewed with gloom and sus-
picion.

An old friend with a somewhat new face is
“Rogues of the Turf,” produced for the first time
at Sydney Criterion on Saturday. The newness,
such as it is, of the face is achieved by placing the
features a little differently. They are the same
old features to a hair and an ear, but they have
been shifted round a bit, and this disarrangement
of a familiar countenance supplies a weird effect.
A play which wears its mouth where the ear usually
is has a tendency to weirdness. An honest
trainer, devotedly fond of his one pretty daughter
(these people always have fashionably-sized
families), a wicked woman of title and her
three living husbands (the third does not appear,
but the others talk a lot about him), the good
young man who wants to marry the trainer’s
daughter, the bad, iron-grey aristocrat who wants
her to live under his “protection,” a (stage) Jew,
a comic stable boy, several horses with their
clothes sometimes on and sometimes off, a pump,
a rose-bowered cottage, and a racing track. All
these pieces are moved by the playwright until he
has made a rather good game out of them—cer-
tainly one that causes the audience to yell for joy.
The game goes just the way the audience likes it,
and when the hero is reduced to a condition of
downfall and collapse by the information that his
wicked wife is still alive, and that his marriage with
the trainer’s pretty daughter is “ off, ” the audi-
ence weeps bitter tears into its umbrella for very
sympathy. But the trouble is only for a moment, for
THE LATE MISS LILIAN WHEELER, a clever
young Australian actress, who died recently in the
United States.

a previous husband pours into the drama and
announces that the date of his marriage to the
same wicked woman was a year earlier. “ Rogues
of the Turf ” is a very climaxy play, and the
knock-out blow which falls on the solar plexus of
Sin is a picturesque act of battery and assault.
Charles Holloway, who plays Flaxman the trainer,
and his soft, round daughter Beatrice, do about
the best work they have yet been guilty of.
Robert Inman, Ethel Appleton, Alice Deorwyn,
Godfrey Cass, and some other men, women and
horses, fill the rest of a sensational bill.

“Veronique” is beginning to be men-
tioned in the playbills of Her Majesty’s, Sydney,
and those who haven’t seen “The Girl from
Kay’s ” will only have another week in which to
make up their minds about it. Judging by the
letters of “ Sydney Citizen ” and “ 1.X.L.”, also
“A Subscriber Since 1314,” there are many vast
intellects in the city ; but a week ought to be time
enough to make up even a colossal mind. The
only right way to make up a mind concerning the
milliner from Kay’s is to decide to see the girl
personally.

To-morrow, Friday, at Her Majesty’s
Theatre, Sydney, a matinee benefit will be
tendered to the veteran actor and manager Alfred
Dampier, who, sick and tired, is about to take a
long sea-voyage in the hope that it may restore
his health. Practically every company of note
in Sydney will take part; the Royal, the
Tivoli, the Criterion and Her Majesty’s companies
will all be represented by their brightest stars,
and the theatre-goer who wants to contribute his
mite will get excellent value for his money. Alfred
Dampier deserves well of this country, for he has
been not only a first-class actor, but a first-class
Australian. He has paid royalties to Australian
authors for their works, and was, as far as this
writer knows, the first Australian manager to do
so. Also he is a pleasant gentleman to meet, and
it is to be hoped that the theatre-going public
will roll up and make his benefit a record
one. In the days when he was well and going
strong Mr. Dampier helped every good cause
which came his way, and did it with a large
generosity which has left him a much less affluent
man than he should be considering the splendid
work he has done. It is “upto ” Sydney to show
now that it doesn’t forget all it owes to Alfred
Dampier.

Sydney Tivoli bill hasn’t been changing
for the better this last fortnight or so; which is
probably the reason why the emi-
nent comedian vocalist proprietor
will once more knock ’em in the Old
Kent Road, in the new ways he
learned in his last trip north. Lately
the Tiv. has had too much of the
girl who dances a, little and sings a
lot about a Zulu—-he is nearly always
a Zulu, because you don’t have to
worry up rhymes for Zulu in this
hot weather; they just drop in on
you :
Nine times out of 10 this is tlie soft
of thing that the girl in the short
frock has been singing lately. Pro-
bably it is a deep-laid scheme not to
distract the sonl from contemplation
of the part of the lady that runs
down below the frock ; but it is a
horrible scheme, for all that. How-
ever, to make amends for that, and
some other poor features (including
a song about stockings, sung in the
poorest little voice heard for many
a day), Hill and Whitaker are there,
and quaint A. G. Spry, and Flor-
ence Challis has brought the “Bull

comedy turn and recalling times, not
so long ago, when he was making

Tivoli, breaks out in a fresh place on

The revival of “ The Sorcerer ” has come
and gone at Melbourne Princess’s, and those
people who didn’t meet the early Gilbertian opera
during its brief stay are to be pitied for their
loss. It was not a brilliant revival. The
two baritones who carried off the vocal honors
were a short, undignified man (Arthur Crane) in a
tall, starchy part, and a thin juvenile, Frank
Wilson, in a plump, elderly character. An ad-
mirable singer as regards voice and technique,
Wilson delivered his two solos in a quick,
declamatory, instead of a slow, plaintive,
ruminative style, which was presumably the
fault of the conductor, who seemed to
miss most of the humor in the orchestral
Oh, my Zulu,
Say you’ll be true;
My eyes of blue
Are wet for you ;
As I wander through
Where the goo-goos goo,

Indeed I do,

accompaniment by hurrying the items. Howard
Vernon’s conception of the name part was
antagonistic to the original performance of George
Grossmith, as directed by the author, also Ver-
non’s crude business with the fatal teapot was
a sad reminder of how Grossmith, and Frank
Thornton his imitator, used to crouch low and
circulate with the rapidity of clockwork mice.
The Sorcerer should be a dry and smileless man
of business, with the professional gloom of an
undertaken tempered by the polite familiarity of a
family grocer, but Howard Vernon presented a
John Wellington Wells who might have been a
licensed victualler at a picnic. The girls,
with an understudy in Miss Ghiloni’s
place, were rather amateurish, and two of
them looked thirty years younger than their stage
characters. All these things being admitted, it is
only necessary to add that “The Sorcerer” is a
better entertainment for intelligent hearers than
any modern musical comedy that draws crowded
audiences. And if the performance were
irreproachable it would have no more charm for
the unintelligent section of the public that mostly
stops away. “The Yeoman of the Guard” is
filling in the three nights between Tuesday a,nd
Saturday, and on Saturday the first Australian
production of “ Utopia Limited,” will give Mel-
bourne something new to talk about. It hasn’t
experienced a first production of a G. and S. opera
since “ The Gondoliers,” fifteen years ago.

Mary Ann and her canary are now in their
last nights at Her Majesty’s, Melbourne. The
boarding-house Innocent will breathe a loving
prayer to Lancelot’s boots for one more week only,
and for that further period a pale, sickly tune will
be repeated several times every evening on the
understanding that it is horribly popular in
London. The alleged popularity of Peter’s song-
tune is beyond belief, but not more incredible
than the pretended origin of Mary Ann’s accent.
Miss Tittell Brune, always a most painstaking
actress, has improved her Mary Ann performance
in all respects save the attempt to give a “Zorner-
setshire” turn to her unadaptable ’Murkan tongue.

Bland Holt’s roaring farcical tragedy at
Melbourne Royal is passing out this week to make
room for a revival of “The Lights o’London.”
Since George Rignold’s last revival of it in the old
Royal a new generation of public has grown up
which will be curious to see the popular “ Lights”
of other days. Also the new generation’s ances-
tors will feel disposed to see it for the first time
under altered conditions. Rignold and co. played
the drama almost to death, and now the Bland
Holt co. is preparing to restore its lost vigor.

A pantomime of the most painful character
came to fill the vacuum at Melb. Bijou last Satur-
day night. It came from Collingwood, supported
by a suburban co. under the direction of John
Wallace. Under less experienced direction the
same co. would not have been less feeble nor the
scenery less expensive. Many unnecessary shows
have happened at the Bijou at one time or other,
but none of the previous things were quite so un-,
called for as the poor little panto, from Colling-
wood.

Princes Court stands where it did, but
the Bostock-Womb well tents have disappeared,

probably be shown at the Town Hall.

A tented show, comprising sundry varieties
in the first part, with a brief bushranging drama
to follow, is about to tour Victoria under the title
of the State Fair. The tent is an auditorium big
enough to seat 2000 people if they rush it, and the
performance is staged outside So that, when'a part
of the tent “ wall ” is removed, the effect is that of a
circular canvas theatre w 7 ith the curtain lip. There
are many touches of novelty in the fixing' and
advertising of the show, but the most distinctive
feature of it all is the manager, a well-known
Melbourne practitioner, who is ordinarily identi-
fied with a brass plate, and who —being an expert
in wizardry and a Barnum at heart—has planned
this expedition at his leisure, and put a lot of
work and love and money into his fad, with a
view to getting a remunerative up-country holiday
from town practice. The State Fair may be said
to make a new departure in typical Australianism.

At the Opera House nothing occurred last
Saturday to overshadow the importance of the
Jackson Family, and the three cyclists whose
respective names terminate in o, and Barnard’s
Pickaninny Marionettes. All marionettes, from
the primitive Punch and Judy upwards, are
essentially amusing. Their deportment is peculiar
to themselves and their capacity for taking
punishment brings tears of satisfaction to the
hardest eye. Barnard’s Picks take their punish-
ment very humanly and their method of bowing
to the audience at the end of the “turn” is a
lesson to low comedians.

“ O.K.”:,The late “ Little Gulliver” was a midget per-
former with a pair of intelligent dancing legs, but, re-
garded as a comedian, he was a sorry contrast to Little
Tich. Viewed through a magnifying glass, Tich would
still be an amusing fellow. Gulliver was huniorous or
absurd merely in the effect of his littleness. A nimble
mannikin laboring to be funny, his antics,were obnoxious
to many people on account of the vulgarity and “cheek ”
of the whipper-snapper. He had nothing of the artist
about him. Tich is notoriously popular with women of
refinement, who can distinguish between natural drollery
and mechanical humor. The same women were disposed
to dislike poor Gulliver. They called him “a little
horror,” when the novelty of his first appearance had
worn off.
Daniel Bandmann, alleged tragedian, has gone where
his dreadful accent doesn t matter. Bandmann was an
inflated, unbearable and insulting German who drifted to
Australia on two occasions many years ago, looking as if
the world existed by his permission. He kindly allowed
the rest of the human race to remain on his alobe provided
it behaved itself, and he benevolently lent his atmosphere
to his poor miserable fellow creatures. It is questionable
if even the Almighty ever put on one-tenth the pomp of

xlulie Palmer was a vastly better actress than he was an
actor, but he regarded her as something not much better
than a door-mat and a little worse than a dog. Shakspeare
turned m his grave every time Bandmann' played one of
his characters, and as Bandmann was always playing
his characters the Bard of Avon was kept revolving
usdy. Even when Daniel the German came down to
bellowing at thin houses in the, dreadful old Sydney
Gaiety he still believed that the world tipped up when-
ever he stepped on the other end of it: When be finally
realised that humanity was too poor and ignorant to

appreciate him, he retired to the U.S. and started farm-
ing. He died the other day, and went to explain to the
Deity how Heaven should lie managed. ; An aggravated
Sydney pressman once said to the fearsome Herr : “ What
I like about Alfred Dampier is that he is everything you
are 1 not,” Bandmann, who was slow and heavy in the
think apparatus, asked four different people in the next
ten minutes the meaning of the remark, and when he got
the full measure of it lie went back in wrath to the bar
where he had met the presspian, and struck a tailor who
looked something like the pressman but who didn’t even
make clothes for him. The greatest actor in the world
was somewhatdisarranged before the matter was sorted
out.
Miss Lilian Wheeler (Mrs. Mainwaring) died, the other
day, from pneumonia, in the cold United States. She was
a Victorian girl, and her youth, beauty and stage talent
made many people fancy that she might one day rival
Nellie Stewart. A certain Desdemona which she did at
Sydney Criterion, with George Rignold painted a deep,
rich tan-boot color as Othello, and Harry Diver as lago,
was something worth remembering. Again as Milady in
“ The Three Musketeers ’’.and as the unfaithful wife of the
heavy Flemish nobleman in “ The Flesh and the Devil,”
what time Diver sat round with his forked beard as Alva
and Ordered executions generally, she did work that was
many miles above the average. But she drifted away to
London and struck worse fortune than she deserved, and
finally the land of the Timber Ham killed her.

older and more various since he visited Australia with
Garner’s Vaudeville Co. long ago—Knowles of the ’alls is
coming this way again with an entertainment that con-
sists mainly of himself. He calls it. “ The Trifles that
Trouble the Traveller,” and will introduce it to Australia
next month, starting in Sydney. Seems that Knowles is
travelling under arrangement with J. 0. Williamson, and
the business of b’ooming the glib-tongued specialist will
devolve upon W. J. Lincoln.
Samuel Hore, who died the other day at Richmond
(Vic.), aged 71, was the last survivor of Hore’s Saxhorn
Band, which performed in Melbourne in ’49.
Carrie Moore’s sudden disappearance from “The Blue
Moon ” cast is explained by the fact that she was wanted
in Glasgow for Courtneidge’s panto.—“Aladdin.” The
panto, season in Britain is a moveable feast these times,
and the gorgeous production at the Grand Theatre started
its “ Xmas ” frivol on November 30th, with Carrie as
principal boy. She hit them in Glasgow as forcibly as
she has lately struck them in London, and shook up the
Cowcaddens, and the Gallowgate, and the Trongate, and
Candleriggs-street, and other strangely-named localities
greatly. Her Australian voice, contrasted with the ordi-
nary Cold Country voice, seems to' be more remarked
than even her vivacity. A local press notice says : “ The
outstanding features are scenic display and music. . . .
Miss Carrie Moore is the Aladdin ... To an attractive
personality she adds an unusually fine singing and useful
dancing ability which won her numerous encores from a
wholly delighted audience.”
When “Tannhauser” was produced in Adelaide some
years ago, a leading resident of the Holy City booked
seats for himself and daughter. He knew nothing of the
opera, except that it was by Wagner, and was understood
to be of a lofty and improving character. But the
opening scene proved too much for his modesty. He
didn’t wait for the song tournament in which Tann-
hauser warbles of love—fleshly love—until the chorus
maidens fly blushing from the scene. The vision of the
Venusberg sufficed to fill that holy citizen \yith horror.
He held the programme before his face and glanced sadly
at his daughter, who immediately dropped her eyelids
and affected to be deeply concerned for her purity. A
few minutes later poor Papa nudged the dear child’s elbow,
and a funereal procession of two passed out of the
theatre. E. F. Benson in “ The Challoners ” relates a
similar incident. Mr. ChalloneG the purist, takes his
comparatively sinful son Martin to hear “ Tannhauser,”
but insists upon his leaving when the curtain rises on
the Wagnerian conception of the Venusberg.
“ 0.K.” : Dolly Castles, in the character of Princess Ida,
is as much out of place as May Beatty would be. And
the similarity in the form and tone of speech is very
noticeable. Dolly, like May, has a jaunty, soubrettish
way of talking, and she spoils the effect of sentimental
lines by wrong inflections and misplaced pauses for
breath. The faults of inflection are partly ineradicable.
Good readers are born. All readers can improve with
practice, but to arrive at anything like perfection one
must be born good, and moreover the voice production
must be highly skilled. Julius Knight is an actor with
a naturally fine voice and an intelligent appreciation of
the lines he speaks, but his way of producing his voice is
bad- It gets hoarse and throaty, and at the end of a long
sentence ic drops away from him. A fine elocutionist
like Maud Milton can sustain the voice for twice as long
- as Julius Knight can. “
Miss “ Milo ” Montague’s last appearances in Melbourne
anticipated to some extent the “ two halls a night ” sys-
- tern which she will possibly follow, like other vaudeville
performers, in the Cold Country (whose coldness must be
accentuated, by the way, to anyone who is playing
-statue).. “ Pa'nsy Montague ” was billed at the Cyclorama
pantomime as “A Block Johnny,” while “The Modern
Milo, at the Opera House, “ portrayed in her own mag-
nificent form the world’s masterpieces of statuary.” The
Victorian Government might do worse than hire Miss
“Milo” as a commercial agent, with a man to lecture
upon her as one of Australia’s magnificent natural
resources. “Milo” as Exhibit A, and likewise Exhibits
B aiid C, in illustration of the resources, would take well.
The statuesque beauty passed her school days at Fitzroy
(Melb.), and the stagfev title, “ Pansy Montague,” was her
property before the stage knew her.’
The Flickergraph, or Bio-Flick, or Biojumpograph, has
nowadays quite given up pretending to be anything but
a fake of the fakest description. At that holy place of
entertainment, Sydney Lyceum, they now advertise that
the Tlieatrescope (or whatever name the Flicker of
the moment goes by) will show a “ stirring representation
of Christians being devoured by lions in the time of
Nero.” For this sort of thing one or two nice, plump
■young girl Christians, in long, white robes, are essential,
so presumably the chorus girl undresses herself all but
her night-gown, to be posed before a camera, and then re-
placed by a dummy filled with raw ox and warm blood
which real lions rend and worry realistically. This is
done in order that the scene may arouse the noblest sen-
timents beneath the shirt front of piety. The Bio-Flick
of the Creation will come yet sure enough.
Two or three different managers have been credited
with the Australian rights of Hall Caine’s drama, “The
Prodigal Sop,” but not one of the early guesses fell upon
Bland Holt. As a matter of fact Bland Holt bought the
play, which came to hand, with all the incidental
“fixings,” by last mail. Bland will make a vigorous
effort to stage “The Prodigal Son ” at Melbourne Royal
before the middle of March, when his present season
closes.
“Nulla”; I viewed the Sydney A.N.A. exhibition
t’other day with a bulging chest. Everything, barring
the coon songs from a phonograph, seemed to fill a long-
felt want. Then suddenly I looked aloft, amj—well, the
two largest flags in the breeze were the Union Jack and
the crimson sun of Japan. Australia for Australians. Bah 1
“ Edvson ”: Newspaper critics are wondering why
“ Princess Ida” has not enjoyed the same popularity as
the other Gilbert and Sullivan operas, since it possesses
all the G. and S. virtues in quite as marked a degree as
almost any of them. But “ Princess Ida ” certainly does
not possess the same G. and S. virtues as “ lolailthe,”
“ Mikado,” “ Gondoliers,” “ Patience,” “ Pinafore,” or
“ Pirates ” —at least it doesn’t possess them in anything
like the same degree. It seems to me that both Gilbert
and Sullivan were afflicted with a tired feeling when they
set about the “ Princess,” and there is a visible straining
for the familiar effects of the firm, which suggests that
the work might be by remarkably clever imitators of the
gifted pair. Gilbert is not nearly as certain of his humor
as in the “ Mikado” and “ Gondoliers,” for instance, and
Sullivan’s efforts to keep up the firm’s, reputation
for bubbling gaiety are apparent. The theme of
“Princess Ida” is a burning question to-day, but the
■opera doesn’t take hold, whereas “ Patience,” although it
deals with a defunct craze, is still an undeniable blast of
merriment.
“T.D.”: Just dead in England, Howard Paul, who
with his wife had much celebrity in the middle of last
century as impersonators of big stars. Not only in make-
up but in acting and singing, they were able to imitate
the leading operatic artists of the day. Mrs. Paul, who
commenced her public career with G. V. Brooke, had a
very fine contralto voice, which, lent itself so well
to the imitation of tenor Reeves that it was very
hard to believe Sims himself was not singing.
Had she chosen, she could have held front
rank as a concert and oratorio artist. She was
probably the only woman who ever doubled the tenor
and contralto parts at a British oratorio festival, which
kind of festival is the most serious and conservative affair
imaginable, and usually keeps clear of anything remark-
able or unusual.' It was Handel’s “Messiah,” and the tenor
had,been mislaid. ..Old Parkinson,- who recently died in-
Melbourne, commenced his musical career with the Pauls
as accompanist, andsthey were responsiblorior -his debut
as a vocalist. '
“H. Drummopd” i I am afraid that Bland Holt and
Anderson are beginning to get on the public’s mind. A
man I know, a regular attendant at this form of enter-
tainment, was to ring me up the other day. He evi-
dently forgot all about it, and tendered in explanation a
remarkable statement about meeting a strange man on
his way home on Xmas Eve. He had a drink with this
strange man, and the next thing he knew was waking up
on Xmas morning in, a strange house with a new suit of
clothes and £l6 in gold gone. A second strange man
coming into the room informed him (my friend) that he
had found him lying in Rushcutters Bay reserve, drugged,
and, out of pity, had taken him honie. Now why should
a man who had forgotten all about an appointment
manufacture a weird story about a strange man who
asked him to have a drink in a strange hotel, and then
drugged him and took him to Rushcutters Bay, where
another strange man came along and, out of generous
pity, took him home? When a man is driven to imagin-
ing this sort of thing, it is quite up to the dramatists who
have driven him to it, to see thac he does not want for the
rest of his days.
Big Nance O’Neil, of the slipped-down-and-shoved-up-
again hair and the undoubted ability, has struck ban
Francisco hard. At all events, the S.F. Bulletin, for
one, is dead gone on the large emotional mummer. Of
Suuermann’s play, “ The Fires of St. John,” it says little
except that “ it is stored with poetry and pregnant with
horror,” but Nance has a good quarter of a page devoted
to herself —in fact, the admiring critic has run himself
dry in writing bewildering somethings re dreaming dogs,
sobbing women in a garden, and hands that grab you in
the darkness, in appreciation of Miss O'Neill.
“ Pro,” : Theatrical voyaging and travel in Australia,
under managerial auspices, is fair enough. Indescribable
scene at St. Pancras, King’s Cross, or Euston Station,
and something parallel at Manchester, Glasgow, Liver-
pool, Newcastle, Birmingham, &c. There are three classes
of towns; First, second, and smaller. These Sunday
trains are dreadful knockabouts. All sorts of time, and
none at all, is kept. Theatricals are usually hitched on
as appurtenances to goods trains. Then at the end of
your train is your trucked scenery, which goes by water
in Australia, whenever such can be managed. What
a book could be written on the travels of modern actors
and actresses, circus people, and the like. I’ve a bookful
in my head. I knew a circus girl with travel experiences
in Australia, Britain, all over Europe, North and South
America, South Africa, Maoriland, India, Java, China,
and Japan. Yet Walhalla (Vic.) was as picturesque as
anything, where all paraphernalia had to go up to the
abode of the gods on horses, and the people seemed to
think the circus had been letdown from Heaven !
James Hannay, a contemporary writer, penned this
pleasant little picture of R. B. Brough, father of Aus-
tralia’s popular Robert“ He was pretty sure to be one
of the promoters of the innumerable little facetious
journals that came out—and went in again. He wielded
the Tomahawk, he glittered in the Firefly ; the echo of
his voice was heard in the snap of the Cracker, and he
helped to work the machinery that set in motion the
Rack. Who so merry at the preliminary supper with
which such ventures were ushered into the world? Who
so philosophically calm when the sham capitalist had
levanted, owing a small balance to his contributors, and
a large one to his paper-maker?” Besides his bright
journalistic work, Brough turned out during his short
life (he died at 32) innumerable burlesques and other
plays, poems, and translations of considerable merit, and
a partly autobiographical novel, “Marston Lynch.”
No sooner does an Australian show up successfully in
London than she (or less frequently he) is besieged with
begging letters by the stranded variety who seem to
imagine that the mere fact of being from the same con-
tinent gives them an undeniable claim upon the gener-
osity of their compatriot. As a rule, these supplicants
merely ask for the amount of their passage money back
to the land of Bent and Nick Willis. But this sort of
thing isn’t confined to England. One big Australian star
relates some ainusing experiences which happened to her
when she re-visited her native land on a concert tour In
one case she was entreated by a compatriot to equip him
with a barrel organ “ to set me up in the music business,”
but the best-remembered request was made by a woman
who asked the successful singer to buy her a substantial
stone cottage in which to end her days in peace.
In Wagner’s first dramatic effort, a mixture of
“ Hamlet ” and “ King Lear,” written at the age of 14,
he killed 42 persons in the course of the play, and for
want of more characters had to make some of them
re-appear as ghosts in the last act.
During Irving’s tenancy of, the Lyceum, Gladstone
frequently occupied a seat let into the proscenium wall,
out of view of the audience, as he was. too deaf, to hear
distinctly if any distance from the stage. The old word-
whirler confessed that he found it very hard, sitting
within half-a-yard of the stage, to keep from rushing on
and making a speech.
When E. T. Smith, father of Melbourne’s John Thomas
Smith, was running grand opera in London, he deter-
mined to do the thing in style. No one-man orchestra
for him; he said: So he engaged two conductors, and the
musicians had to do their best to obey both batons, with
results that pleased nobody but Smith. There was general
thanksgiving when Colonel Mapleson took over the opera
branch of Smith’s business, and gave Arditi, who was one
of the dual conductors, sole charge of the orchestra, but
Smith reckoned that Mapleson didn’t know a great idea
when he saw it.
Henry Irving, like most other departed managers, left
behind him a number of dramas submitted for his con-
sideration—some of them accepted long ago but still un-
acted ; others with never a hope of being produced. He
had made out the cast for one of them, in which he was
to figure as an Indian chief. Charles Wyndham Has a
vast store of unacted plays, but most of these he has
“commissioned more or less, and paid for.” Still the
authors are growing old while waiting for production and
possible royalties. But things are not quite so bad in this
respect as they used to be. J. B. Buckstone invited a
dramatist who persisted in asking for the return of his
unacted masterpiece to take his pick out of a large Chest
full of MS. plays. Charles Mathews airily told an author
who complained that his plays were neither used nor
returned by Mathews, though he enclosed stamps, to
“continue to send the stamps; they always come in
handy.” The imported play, at any rate, is treated
better than this in Australia. For instance, Wills and
Herman received an advance of £lOO from Williamson
and Garner for “ The Royal Ransom,” in which Charles
11. figures, and as the play was not acted within a few
years, the Australian rights reverted to the authors.
Australia was not considered ripe for a Charles Stuart
boom in the eighties.
Sydney Daily Telegraph of January 15,
sympathetically quoting London Economist on
the alleged evil of “bursting up big estates,”
rejoices that the Queensland Bill to prevent land
monopoly and the S. Australian pill to impose a
progressive land-tax were rejected by the Legisla-
tive Councils of those States. That is a pretty
pass for an organ professing Badical Liberalism
to reach, and the inspiration of the paper’s volte
face is looked for with some curiosity. The last
sentence of the article hints the inspiration :
Is it essential that the State should itself purchase the
land prior to its cultivation ?
What the Telegraph aims at, therefore, is the
acclimatisation in Australia of the old world land-
lord and tenant system, the system which has
sweated the farmer and farm-laborer in every land,
and which is responsible for most of the degrada-
tion of the masses in civilised countries. In the
East all over Australia land has passed into the
ands of a few without payment or anything like
equivalent payment, and at present it may be
taken up by a capitalist or corporation at much
less than its prospective value ; so if proprietors
could be assured that they would not be burst up
or mulcted in a progressive tax, the way would be
laid open to establish in Australia the agrarian
relations between landlords and their serfs which
universal history condemns.
The Children’s Hospital, Melbourne, is
responsible for another appearance of Mr. Byron
Moore as author and publisher of a children’s
story-book. Some years ago' the sec. of the
Y.R.C., who knows little about horse-racing but
is an ardent sport as regards oratorios and church
music, brought out a tvvo-and-sixpenny volume of
up-to-date Australian fairy yarns—“ The Cruel
Imp, &c.” —for the benefit of the Children’s|tlos-
pital. The hospital has derived about £260 from
the sale of “The Cruel Imp,” which is still
inquired for. Byron Moore hopes to repeat the
success. His new book —“Her Boyal Highness
Queen Bee” (why not “Her Majesty ” ?)—better
bound than the first one, opens with a pleasantly
instructive story of bee life in the hive and among
the flowers. And there are two other stories,
illustrated by Miss Hope Evershed, of Launceston!
In some of Miss Evershed’s pictures of the giri
kiddie, Fidele, there is a very graceful expression
of the artist’s tender feelihg for her subject.
Nowadays the world is full of strange tales of
mysterious “dopes.” Some are intended to work the
drinker up to a state of frenzy, in which he can whiz past
all competitors in the race ; others fire the imagination
and make the man who usually enjoys the sordid' pastime
of making money write poetry; others are of a more
subtle nature, and their duty is to: add a flush to the
sunset, lend sweetness to the voices 'of women, and
bouquet to life generally. For all these purposes
there is only one real elixir, and that is Charles Heidsteck
champagne, old and dry. It doesn’t deprive one of
reasoning power but it strengthens the will, stimulates
the hunt, and brings the nerves into the harmonious
tranquility that wraps everything seen, heard, smelt or
tasted in a nimbus of divinity.* '"‘“‘O'

The bomb outrage at Detective O’Donnell’s,
in Melbourne, hid rin amusing sequel. The
editor of a small Melbourne weekly, a nervous
little man, has an idea that, because of two or
three anti-gambling pars full of the anger
of an elderly sheep printed in his neglected
paper, he is a marked man amongst the
gangs that engineer the “schools” and “clubs,”
and his life and limbs are in daily peril.
On the Monday morning, following the outrage
this editor was sitting in his little choked office,
writing a small pale attack on the instigators of
the. crime, when something crashed through the
window and fell on the table an front of him.
The editorial yell stirred a vast city building in all
its compartments, and the editor himself dived
clean through a thin pine partition, and fled,
hatless and coatless, into the street, with dis-
tracted hair and wild eyes, Codling for the police,
He found the police, and took them back to look
at the bomb. It was a second-hand cricket ball
that the boys employed in a neighboring estab r
lishment had knocked through the window while
playing cricket in the lane at lunch time.

No sooner had the .Victorian Government
offered a £5OO reward for the capture of the bomb-
thrower who tried to wreck Detective O’Donnell’s
house in Fitzroy than Jack Wren handed the
Herald a £5OO cheque to add to it, and further—
O’Donnell having hinted that the betting ring
had a finger in the pie—offered the detective
another £lOOO if he could prove that he (Wren)
was in any way implicated. It is a remarkable
position, and perhaps to be explained by adver-
tisement. Tlie detective was getting such gor-
geous notices because the nitro-glycerine, or the
ginger-pop, or whatever it was, exploded and
wrecked the sofa on which his daughter wasn’t
sleeping, that perhaps Wren rushes to share
the boom, and now testimonials may begin to
pour on to him from old gamblers testifying that
they have lost money to him frequently but he
never used dynamite on them. - What with Bent
and bombs and Wren, and the crying smell of the
Yarra, Melbourne is getting to be a noisy place.

A Newcastle (N.S.W.) pilot celebrated
January 11 with a brave action. On going down
to move a ship (the British barque Itata) he found
it ablaze amidships. It was laden with saltpetre,
and threatened to set the wharf on fire. It was
no part of his duty to shift a roaring volcano, but
the pilot (M‘Corquodale) collected the crew and
started. Once clear of the wharf the pilot, not
satisfied with saving the adjacent shipping, deter-
mined to prevent the confusion which would
follow the sinking of the ship in the narrow fair-
way. Ordering his tugs to go ahead, he took
the wheel himself and started across the
harbor. But the wind blew the flames
ahead so that the order could not be obeyed.
Then . the tugs were brought aft, and ordered
to butt like billy-goats at the stern of the vessel.
In this fashion the combusted barque staggered
across the channel out of deep water. As it
grounded the masts went overboard, the sides
opened out, and the scorched and half-blinded
pilot took a header (the rest of the crew had been
ordered into safety long before), and just then the
explosion occurred, and scattered a good part of
the barque over Newcastle.
'Sydney read a fine shriek in the Daily
Telegraph’s biggest type early this week. H. A.
Parsons, a comparative youngster, who inherited
wealth from the J. H. Angas family in S. Aus-
tralia, arrived in Sydney the day before, and put
up at the city’s most swagger hotel. In addition
to inheriting riches, young Parsons inherited the
job of Japanese Consul in Adelaide from his late
father, Langdon Parsons; and when the Jap.
Consul in Sydney wanted to call on the alleged
Australian who is the Jap. Consul in Adelaide,
a hotel porter said he was sorry, but the gentle-
man, not being a traveller or a lodger,
couldn’t get into the licensed pub. And there-
upon the disloyal D.T, lets H. A. Parsons rage in
big type, under big scare-heads, through two-
thirds of a column of its choicest space; and it
prints the rubbish, not as an ordinary letter, but
under the headings :
SUNDAY IN SYDNEY.
HOW IT STRIKES A VISITOR.
EXTRAORDINARY RESTRICTIONS.
RECEIVING GUESTS ON THE DOORSTEP.
Through half-a-column, H. A. Parsons (abetted
by the D.T.) shrieks Stinking Fish furiously, as
he recounts “ a remarkable experience which, in
the interests of the Queen City of the South,
should be made public, ” the shriek being directed
against the new Liquor Act. But, having
finished the shriek under the four flaring head-
lines, H. A. Parsons winds up by saying that,
as a barrister, he is clearly of opinion that the
Act doesn’t require'the pub. to do anything of the
kind that was done in this case; also that the
clause relied upon is a copy of the clause in the
English Act. In other words, the whole grievance
is against a servant in Parsons’ pub.; and yet,
apparently because it seemed to give a chance to
throw some mud at the country and its laws (State
laws in this case), the D.T. gave it all this promi-
nence. Present writer’s shirt wasn’t laundried as
wejll as he likes it, last week ; and if he gets time
• he'is going to write three-quarters of a column to
the D.T., and under six headings he intends to
give his Mary Ann “ slops, ’’ -and ask how the shirt
would impress a visitor. And when the D.T.
doesn’t print it, he is going to point to Parsons’
shriek, which it printed in big type, and ask
“ Whatfor ?” To be addressed in pidgin English
ought to soften the D.T.’s heart, anyhow. It
seems to have most use for people who can only
talk that sort of English.

The stoppage by the Commonwealth Go-
verment of opium supplies moved one irate Wes-
tralian “Naturalised Chinese” to remark that
“ Australians would yet be sorry they prohibited
the importation ” of the drug, because, although
the opium-weakened Chow only competed with
the whites in market-gardening and cabinet-
making, as soon as he regained his strength he
would be heard of in other fields of industry. In
fact, said our fellow subject, the Chow being
“ hard-working and economical, will yet, like the
Jew, be a wealthy section of society.” At this
rate Australia is doing the Chinaman a good turn
by its anti-opium law, and the yellow section of
the community should present boiled dog to
Alfred Deakin instead of being angry.

Wickedness survives long among the poor
of Sydney. Magistrate Stephen Murphy, giving
evidence as to Old Age Pensions, cited, with
ghastly humorlessness, the cases of Mrs. W., Old
Age Pensioner, who was “living in a state of
adultery ’’ with C., and Mrs. R., Old Age Pen-
sioner, who “ was living immorally ” with a man.
And the pension age in N.S.W. is 65 !
SHE ONLY MEANT HER CAMERA.
MRS. PETERSON (pouring out the tea): “I sup-
pose you're still taking 'snaps,' are you!"
MRS. DE BOOSEY : “ Schnapps, indeed! I never,
in all my life. How can you have the
audacity to hint at such a thing?” Sec.,dc.
Richard Teece, of the A.M.P., told the
Royal Commission on Old Age Pensions that
any young man of 20 who would pay his office £1 a
quarter could get an annuity of £5O a year from the age
of 65, and if he died before reaching that age all the
money he had paid would be returned by the Society.
Quite true, no doubt. Put how many young men
of 20, able to pay over £4 a year, can be expected
to realise that, after 45 years’ work, they will be
glad to go into retirement on an income of less
than £1 per week ? And if any considerable num-
ber of such young men could be found, would they
be the best type of men ? It is a very hopeless
kind of young man who feels that way.

“ F.” : What I admire in illicit love is its
modesty. It never flaunts itself in fashionable
weddings or asks to be congratulated.
A thriving industry in
Sydney just now is Panama
snatching, and the man
who walks abroad
with an expensive
leaf hat on the
top of his
nobility to
breathe the
cool air of
the midnight
hour requires
to keep a
sharp look-
out and be
ready to fight
or run as the
occasion de-
mands. The
snatchers are
mostly young
men. They
sometimes
hunt in pairs,
but mostly go
alone, wear-
ing light shoes
and close-fit-
ting skull
caps. The or-
dinary, well-
set-up, robust
citizen is sel-
dom interfer-
ed with ; the
victims are
drunks or
cripples, or
men who are
obviously un-
able to either
fight or run.
The snatch is
simple and
effective. The snatcher comes at a
run, and as he passes strikes the quarry
on the back of the head with the butt of the palm
with sufficient force to knock down either a cripple
or a drunk, and at the same time his fingers close
OD j u -fh® snatcher’s speed hardly slackens,
and before the victim has recovered from his sur-
P nse or rom the shock, the thief has vanished
round the corner. There he slips the skull-cap
into his pocket, whistles a tune and bids John at
t“® corner a cheery. “Good-night, sergeant!”
Whereat the guardian of the peace coughs,
salutes, and marches off with his chest stuck out.
Later on, when he meets an angry and almost in-
coherent gentleman with an odor of whisky about
“ im > he persuades him to go home quietly. So
far the police have not discovered the “fence”
by whom the hats are cleaned, re-blocked and
sold again to the trade or the public.

The male vanity which elevates itself on a
P a ir °f absurd high heels found a victim in
Melbourne t’other day. Inquest showed that
deceased, a railway shunter, began work in an
elegant pair of boots of the high, narrow heel type
and was hand-shun ting a truck when the vain
things caught in a V-shaped intersection of the
rails, and screwed him down. An on-corning truck
loomed ahead, and he screamed for help. But
neither he nor his mate’s efforts could loosen that
deadly grip in time.

The steamer Carlisle, which has gone to
the bottom at Saigon (China), had a stormy close
to its life. Late in 1904 the Carlisle left Vladi-
vostoclc for Port Arthur (then Russian) with a
million pounds worth of war material. ' It fell
into Japanese hands and was made a prize.
An accident to the Carlisle’s propeller led
to its abandonment by the gallant Japs,
who didn’t seem always to play the war
game with overmuch "recklessness. Then
the captain of the Carlisle—probably
named M'Tavish—brought the crippled
steamer to the Philippines. There it
was again attacked by the Japanese,
but beat them off, and got safely to
Manila, where it was “ interned.” At
Manila the crew managed to repair
the machinery and, eluding the Ameri-
can and Japanese warships which were
watching, staggered out to try to de-
liver their cargo to the passing Baltic
Fleet (Port Arthur was by then in Jap
hands). The captain failed to find
Admiral Ro. and put in at the French
port of Saigon. Then a blind Russian
Government started to raise objections
. paying for the Carlisle’s services—-
ineffectual certainly, but gallant enough
to deserve some recognition—and the row about
the bill went on whilst weeds grew over the
shell loaded with a million pounds’ worth of ex-
plosives. Something under the circumstances was
bound the happen. It happened in the shape of
a fire, and what’s left of the Carlisle, with its
torpedoes, and dynamite, and cordite, is at the
bottom of the sea.

The Syrian is becoming quite a feature in
Australian police court squabbles, and his capacity
for giving evidence is something wonderful. In
Melbourne last week, Mr. Joseph Kinnon, one of
Benhadad’s countrymen, attested quite seriously
that his compatriot, Mr. Hannah Joseph, struck
him 30 times over the eye with a stick in Exhi-
bition-street. The court inspected Joseph’s eye,
looked doubtfully at Hannah, and compromised
with a fine of £3.
THE SACKED FREETRADER.
“ Why did you leave the Freetrade League ?”
“ Didn't leave it. They expelled me for using
inferior Australian shaves instead of import-
ing them."
One Brown visited the Melbourne detec-
tives the other night with terror in his eye, and
related a story which might have been written by
Ambrose Pratt. He had been riding his bicycle
at Oakleigh, and two masked miscreants had
stepped out of the scrub and called on him to bail
up, whereupon he bailed. One disguised mis-
creant held the muzzle of a revolver to his temple,
while the other ransacked him and collected the
sum of 4s. 3d. Brown’s story contained much
wealth of detail, and hardened detectives almost
wept when he told it with appropriate gesture
and inflection. But there were several points about
the tale which did not fit in with known facts, and
after three days Brown had to tell the same sym-
pathetic detectives that the whole thing was
an invention brought about by reading Knox’s
speeches in Hansard or some such cause. It is
not often that a man is found telling such a tale
for 4s. 3d. The romancer is usually one who has
to account to his wife for the £5 he spent in
riotous living, a,nd he invariably falls in by cloth-
ing the loss with needless wealth of sensational
detail. The man who wishes to explain the miss-
ing fiver to his own little rosebud should say that
it was stolen by a pickpocket as he was crushing
through the railway wicket to bring it to her
quickly. There is no breaking down such a story
and it is not worth putting in the papers. But
the tale of a Kelly gang with masks and
revolvers, and glaring eyes like the headlights
of a locomotive, is one that is billed in the
columns of the daily press with the significant
headline “ Alleged Robbery,” and it is sure to be
blown out by the policemen who was on duty
where the outrage didn’t happen.

Vic. Government star-gazer Barrachi sug-
gests that the Australian Government should
establish wireless telegraph stations, at Cape
Leeuwin and Cape York for the reception of
weather notices from approaching steamers a few
hundred miles away, and so enable weather fore-
casts to be given a week ahead. This idea shows
how many advantages wireless telegraphy— a
movable sort of thing dancing on the surface of
the waters—has over the cable, anchored like a
mass of dead ironmongery at the sea-bottom, and
as unapproachable (unless you get hold of the end
of it), as a monarch when a beggar wants to speak
to him.

Adelaide claims that its heat wave of the
first week of the year was the worst-but-three on
the local records. The Thursday, Friday, and
baturday registered 112, 113, and 110 in the shade.
But m 1858 the end of January stayed at 103 or
over for nine days running, and, incidentally, the
weather climbed up to 116'3, which has stood as
the city s absolute record ever since.
THE GIBSON GIRL.
[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
Stated in American papers that C. Dana Gibson will
abandon pen and pencil, and devote himself to oil-paint-
ing. Is it good-bye to the Gibson girl ?
She was a sweet and splendid thing
To woo ;
Well worth the purchase of a ring
Or two.
No hag all clavicle and rib :
A churl
Were he who did not love the Gib-
Son girl.
Ever the same her rounded chin,
Her face;
Unchanged the tempting bust within
Her lace ;
Unaltered by his faithful nib
The swirl
Of silk and muslin round the Gib-
Son girl.
Long years he loved her, nor in vain
Adored ;
Gold in his hands like Autumn grain
Was poured.
Orders for pictures came ad lib. —
A pearl
Of price unrivalled was the Gib-
Son girl.
Yet that white neck that so re-called
The swan,
That eyebrow which all hearts enthralled
Are gone;
The waist that others loved to crib,
The curl,
Are in oblivion with the Gib-
Son girl.

MARY: “ Here’s an article says that widows make
the best wives.”
JIM: “No good, Mary! I can’t afford it.”
Tweed River is about the dampest spot in
N.S.W., and in 1905 more than a fathom of rain was
measured at a spot a few miles south of the eastern
corner of the Queensland border. The driest spot
in N.S.W. last year was at the western end of the
same boundary-line, where Tibooburra collected
little more than two inches in the twelve months,
The annual rainfall at the western extremity of
the border-line would only count as one decent
shower at the eastern end.
Gradually old world ideas and conventions
are being worked out of the Australian character.
N.S.W. Manchester Unity Oddfellows, at their
last annual meeting, refused to spend £lOO on a
new banner, despite the fact that goats could be
thrown through the holes in, the old one; the
general opinion was that banners and regalia were
useless excrescences on friendly society work.
This is a great departure from the British tradition,
which makes regalia, mock titles and other mum-
mery the principal aims of friendly societies. The
Britisher of lowly life finds some consolation in
such things. A gaudy apron or a quaint title gets
him away for an hour or two from the drab
monotony of life and gives him the delusion that
he is a peer or has inherited a brewery. That sort
of thing should be unnecessary in Australia, where
there is still hope that a man of. energy and intelli-
gence can rise, and where he is not yet reduced
to finding his only consolation in putting on ridi-
culous clothes, that he may play for an hour or two
at having risen or having been born in an elevated
station.

“ Bofc” writes from Victoria
“ Ed.” (writing in Bulletin of 7/12/’O5) is hopelessly out
of it when he states that the trees on the Broadmeadows
plains lean to the north. No one who had ever taken the
trouble to look at them, could be guilty of making such a
rash statement as that. They invariably lean towards the
south ; the sweeping north (not south, as he suggests)
winds that roar that way being accountable. He reckons
they are somewhat sheltered from the winds by the
Dividing Range. Not at all! If it blows harder in Sheol
than one of those northerly gales blow, then may I never
go there. .
As to south winds, they do blow hard at times, but
nothing in comparison with the other. “On this bleak,
low-lying, wind-swept plain, Bent has established his
sanatorium for consumptives,” so “ Ed.” says. I should
like to know if he has ever seen the Sanatorium. If so, it
must have been immediately after a grand and unholy
Christmas drunk. The sanatorium is established (I have
seen it often) at Greenvale, distant about three miles
from Broadmeadows, and is an ideal spot—that is, if such
a place could be found in the locality. The water supply
is admittedly shocking, being only from iron tanks, and
to drink from those in this weather would be worse than
consuming stale beer.
This paper rather admires “Bot’s” logic. The
sanatorium, according to him, is an ideal spot
with a shocking water supply that is worse than
stale beer.

“ Ne’er-do-weel ” : Trial by jury has been
a sinful failure in Queensland of late. There have
been two remarkable examples lately. One was
the Ryan case, in Toowoomba, where the jury
found Ryan guilty of murder, but recommended
him to mercy because nobody saw him do the deed.
The other was the Collins case. In this last the
Chief Justice gave a particularly clear and lucid
summing-up, and the jury, after hours of squab-
bling, found Collins not guilty of all the acts of
cruelty charged to him, but, at the same time,
guilty of one. They could not determine whether
that act of cruelty was due to his wife’s miscon-
duct or not. They said that there had been quite a
lot of perjury on one side or the other, and that
was obvious enough for a dead man to notice it.
Three of the jurymen made elaborate speeches in
an apparent attempt to show that they were not
so stupid as they appeared to be, while the fourth
threw a fit. For this miserable result the male
litigant has to pay the jury fees for an 18 days
sitting; to say nothing of the charges of Gentle-
man One, also Gentleman Two and so on up to
Gentleman Ten. In a large case nowadays the
Queensland jury hardly ever seems to make up its
mind. Either it has so huge a mind that it can’t
be made up except by machinery, or its mind is,
greased and slips like a buttered football every
time it tries to get hold of it.

The weary woolly woeful West of Queens-
land has many of the native population going
through life with the burden of “jNorman,” or
“Lamington,” or “Bowen,” or some other ex-
Governor’s name hanging to them. The
“Chelmsford ” fad is already starting. “Name
the child,” said a surpliced parson the Sunday
after Chummy had livened up the former quietude
of Government House. “Chelmsford,” gaily said
the mother, and added—“ This boy’s grandfather
was a groundman at Oxford and used to bowl to
his Ex.’s father.”

During the year just past some more or
less historical N.S.W. properties changed hands.
One, ‘ ‘ Wivenhoe, ”
near Camden, was a
public gift to Charles
Cowper in the long
ago. It brought
£lO,OOO. The N.W.
corner of Pitt and
King streets also
changed hands ; the
corner has been known
by various names.
Seventy years ago
the “ Bunch of
Grapes ” Inn, kept
by a Jew, Michael
Napthali, stood
there. Ten years
after it was the
“Rainbow”
Tavern, kept by
Alfred Too-
good; in the
roaring fifties
Mr. Toogood
had a music
hall, or “ free
and easy,” in
full swing. He kept the Rain-
bow” until 1867, when M'Grath and Punch, suc-
cessful scullers, started business there and dropped
the old name. They soon dissolved partnership,
J a mes Punch keeping Punch’s Hotel, while
M‘G r ath went to &eorge-street to the “Wine
Vaults ” Tavern. James Punch died in the old
building, and his brother Frank succeeded him.

“ L.B. : The frequent appearance m the
Russian cables of statements that trouble has
been caused by “hooligans” is partly accounted
for by the fact that Russia has adopted the Eng-
lish word “hooligans” to describe a gang of
roughs, turning it into “ khuligam.”
“ L.” : Zangwill gives us the London Mary
Ann, with possibilities of conversion into the
dazzling heiress Marian, but there is the other
kind, toiling miserably through a life of perpetual
slavery, and altogether too horribly hopeless to be
put into a play. Behold George Moore’s Emma—
not a fictitious character :
Emma, I remember you—you are not to be forgotten-
up at 5 o’clock every morning, scouring, washing, cook-
imr dressing those infamous children ; 17 hours at least
out of the 24 at the beck and call of landlady, lodgers,
and quarrelling children ; 17 hours at least out of. the 24
drudging in that horrible kitchen, running up stairs with
coals and breakfasts and cans of hot water; down on
vour knees before a grate, pulling out the cinders with
those hands-can I call them hands? The lodgers some-
times threw you a kind word, but never one that recog-
nised that you were akin to us—only the pity that might
be extended to a dog. And I used to ask you all sorts
of cruel questions ; I was curious to know the depth of
animalism you had sunk to, or rather out of which you
had never been raised. Sometimes my words were too
crude, and they struck through the thick hide into the
quick, into the human, and you winced a little ; but this
was rarely, for you were very nearly, oh, very nearly an
animal. Your temperament and intelligence were just
those of a dog that has picked up a master—not a real
master, but a makeshift master who may turn it out at
any moment. Dickens would sentimentalise or laugh
over you ;I do neither. I merely recognise you as one of
the facts of civilisation.
Emma had lived thirty-odd years, and was likely
to continue in this slavery all her life. She could
not read or write, yet went to church and pre-
tended to look at the prayer-book (poor pretence !)
till she found it “made her eyes bad.” This
typical London lodging-house slavey did not
know whether England was an island or a moun-
tain, and asked if a woman who was going to
America would need to travel all .night. Her
only travels were those to the slum in which she
was born and to the few shops at which the land-
lady dealt. At last she got a lover, but had to
give him up because she hardly ever had a spare
half-hour in which to go out with him. After
engaging her at a miserable wage, the landlady
had gradually cheated her out of sums that
amounted to £4O ; yet Emma would not insist on
having her wages, or leave if they were not paid,
as she “didn’t know how Mrs. S would get
on without me!” And Mrs. S would keep
her and cheat her till some day when she became
too ill to work, then cast her out as something she
was done with.

On top of the smothered-up narrative of
the breaking of a truck-axle on the railway line
between Sunbury (Vic.) and Sydenham, came
lately three more reports of similar accidents, in
different parts of the State and all on main lines.
Several trucks were reduced to matchwood, and a
few citizens slightly damaged ; but Commissioner
Tait orders a private departmental inquiry, and
then assures a fidgetty public that everything is
in first-class order, but that accidents will occur
even on “the best managed railway system in
the world.” Engineers, however, aver that these
frequent breaking of axles are due, not to fatal
defects in the axles, but to slight flaws which are
aggravated to sudden smash by the uneven and
unsafe condition of the lines themselves. Main-
tenance expenses have been so cut down that
many lengths of the permanent way are said t 6
be positively dangerous. That great smash-iip
comes daily nearer. # ,
A Maoriland father recently put up a hor-
rible record by getting four liquor prohibition
orders in one lot. The orders set forth that two
sons and two daughters were not to be supplied
with any more alcohol.

A police inspector handed a picturesque
rebuke to the St. Kilda (Vic.) honorariums, lately,
as to their treatment of scorching motorists. Said
he : “ Eive shilling fines are insufficient to defer
motor-fiends. In Prahran, the lowest fine in-
flicted for furious driving has been £5, which im-
poses a wholesome lesson on the wind-jamming,
goggle-clad drivers, whose speed is the hurricane’s
and whose care is the devil’s.” This gentleman
possesses a fine turn for language.

Ay ! Pray for her ! she needs it;
Pray that she go not down ;
Pray that she cleanse her from the hordes that choke
each squalid town,
Where a hundred meagre hands are stretched to clutch
the crust —the bone—
Flung from the tables of the rich ; fought for with curse

By alien spawn that come to sweat—and starve with

[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
JDE by side in the pale moonlight
Two figures sat in the early night.
One was a man who was half afraid ;
The other a timid, shrinking maid.
A friendly cloud came over the sky,
And the Johnny grew bold as it caught his eye.
Her waist he squeezed, and he turned his face,
And he kissed that girl in the proper place ;
And all was silent except for this—
The lonely echo of one small kiss.
She may have blushed, or she may have not ;
But she silently sat in that self-same spot ;
While the man not a syllable spoke aloud,
But just hung off for another cloud.
The cloud soon came , and another, too ;
And he did what anyone else would do.
And still the maiden, who hardly stirred,
Just sat there silent, and breathed no word.
At last, as he gave her one on the cheek,
He cried: “Oh, darling, why don't you speakV'
And the maiden said, with impatient sigh,
“ Not notv, let’s wait till the clouds roll by."

The meeting of A.M.P. members to decide
about pursuing' business in foreign parts, where the ex-
penses will be heavier, and the society’s interest earnings
will be lower, will be held in Sydney to-morrow (Friday).
To take business which costs more to get, and which earns
less in interest, means reduced bonuses in a mutual
office; and as the A.M.P. is a mutual office, those who
haven’t already sent in their proxies with the “Yes”
crossed out, will be wise if they rush out and do the job
forthwith, and thereby help to keep the bonuses where
they are. All sorts of good intentions won’t count in the
ballot unless the proxy is there to back up the good in-
tentions.

Just when it can do some practical good, an
elaborate paper, contributed to Biqmetrika, the European
statistical biological journal, by A. O. Powys, has been
issued by the Victorian Government Statist. It is a pro-
found examination of N.S.W. birth and death rate figures,
largely those contained in the 1901 census ; and it shows
(with the help of Mulhall’s figures) that of every 1000
born, the following numbers survive at various ages :
Age. England. N.S. Wales.
20 .. 706 .. 798
40 .. 597 .. 696
60 .. 405 .. 500
80 .. 96 .. 116
That list throws a whole flood of light on the question
why life-insurance,offices in N.S. Wales can afford to pay
much larger bonuses than those offices which are doing
business in Great Britain.

Estimates, now fairly reliable, of. the 1905-6
wheat harvest have been made, and the aggregate for the
three great wheat-producing States gives bigger figures
than for any previous year, with the one exception of
1903-4. In the latter year N.S. W., Victoria, and S. Aus-
tralia yielded nearly' 69,000,000 bushels ; but, as a set-off
against that, there was the failure of 1902-3, when the
total was only 10,200,000 bushels. This season, the har-
vest will amount to about 56,000,000 bushels; and,
though that is 13,000,000 bushels below the 1903-4
record, its effects in some directions will be
greater because it is the third of a succession
of phenomenal yields. When the i 903-4 crop was taken
off, practically every cocky in the country (outside
S. Aus., where the season was fair) was deep in debt to
the local store, and the local store was in debt to the
wholesale house, and the wholesale house was a dark
shadow that haunted the bank where it kept its over-
draft. The banker took risks (he had to in many cases—
it was a game of back up or forfeit), and charged high
rates ; hence'the swollen bank profits of 1903, 1904, and
part of 1905 ; they began to shrink in the last-named year.
But now the cocky has paid the local store, and
the local store has squared up with the whole-
sale house, and the wholesale house isn’t half
as respectful to the bank manager as it was. When
a solid-looking man is very respectful to a bank
manager just at present, it is mostly, not because
he wants his limit raised, but because he wants the bank
to take money at the old rate of 4 per cent. ; and when
he finds out that that is hopeless, he wants co leave money
on fixed deposit for two years at 3i p.c., and it is coming
to this, that the bank, while nominally quoting 3£ p.c.,
finesses to save itself from taking money at such a rate
for more than 12 months.
The banking for last, quarter are not
all in yet ; but even those published two months ago
told their tale. In the September quarter of 1904 the
deposits totalled £107,904,621 ; 12 months later they stood
at £117,316,815. The advances, on the other hand, prac-
tically stood where they were., For the last quarter, with
the results of the heavy wool crop showing up, the accu-
mulation of money will be more striking. On the 12
months the Victorian banks show an increase in deposits
from £30,727,967 t0£34,181,967 ; and advances have moved
down from £29,918,226 to £29,293,210. In N.S.W. the
Bank of,N.S.W. alone shows these figures :
Dec., 1903. Dec., 1905.
Deposits .. £10,907,660 £13,046,840 Inc. £2,139,180
Advances.. 10,431,049 10,321,211 Dec. 109,838
It isn’t surprising- under these circumstances that banks
are not at present chasing round after deposits. Now
the proceeds of the big wheat harvest will come in, and
the proceeds also of the sales of metals, which are wisely
being rushed out to catch the boom markets. There are
no heavy back bills to be paid Off as there were a couple
of years ago.. The money is free, and what is going to be
done with it?. The State Governments will absorb some,
exchanging part of the old foreign debt for some new
local debt; but it is doubtful whether, in view of the big
wheat crops and other things noted, "this will steady the
market enough to keep bank rates for deposits where
they are. It is a disgrace to Australia that, through the
absence of industries which would create a demand for
the money it has, large sums are also being shipped to
Europe for investment there. But, ' even with these
things in operation, two results seem very probable—(l) a
lower rate for deposits,. '(2) still higher'prices’ for Aus-
tralian investment securities. Perhaps, also, the suburban
land boomer will make another attempt to work up some
excitement, though he hasn’t had over-much encourage-
ment in his recent efforts.

There are 14 central sugar mills in Queensland
which have had State assistance. Eight of these, not
haying failed to meet their obligations to the State,’still
control their own affairs—North Isis, Mulgrave, Mossman
Racecourse, Marian, Plane Creek, North Eton, and Double
Peak. Six others have couie into the Hands of the State
as mortgagee, and are- now under the absolute control of
the Government, which, altogether, had advanced
£500;000 on the business. When Dr. Maxwell took charge
as Controller the six “bad” mills showed assets valued
at .£251,805 ; these were revalued and written down to
£191,716. The eight “ good ” mills showed assets valued
at £329,318 ; these were revalued at £289,724. The totals
thus stood:—
Written
Old Value. Re-Value. Down.
“ Good ” Mills .. £329,318 £289,724 £39 594
“Bad’’Mills .. 251,805 191,716 60,089
Total ..£581,123 £481,440 £99,683
The State advances and repayments to the “bad’’mills
were as follow to Dec. 31st, 1903
Interest
Advanced. Repaid. Unpaid.
Nerang .. £19,999 Nil. £6590
Moreton .. 44,565 £3OOO 9084
Mt. Bauple .. 32,481 508 '6329
Gin Gin .. 52,000 Nil. 9364
Pleystbwe .. 35,472 4089 4201
Prokerpine .. 68,100 5026 16,618
The position was this: Not only was the State losing
interest, but, as shown above, the security for the
principal was depreciating. Thus, while the Proserpine
mill had borrowed £68,100 and had repaid £5026,
leaving£63,o74 owing to the State, the assets were only
valued at £45,973 ; so in connection with this one mill
there vyas an advance of £17,101 not represented by
assets, in addition to the unpaid interest. For the six
mills the total of these two items, representing unsecured
debt, was £100,465. Apart from the fact that the central
mills were not doing the work for which they were
designed, this was the State’s justification for taking over,
control.
The State, through Dr. Maxwell, has managed
the business since January, 1904 ; and here are the
results as shown by the profit and loss accounts of each
of the six mills :

The profits are charged in every case with interest and
depreciation, the latter ranging from 5 to 8 p.c. p.a.,
according to situation, character of asset, and other cir-
cumstances. As for the loss usually shown in the half-
year Jan.-June, 1905, it has to be pointed out that in
that period but little product is going to market, while
standing charges (insurance, interest, &c.) have neverthe-
less to be paid. Only a full year’s accounts can fairly be
considered, therefore ; and, remembering that, in the
first full year of State control, the supply of cane was
irregular, many farmers having been utterly discouraged
by the old mismanagement, the financial results can only
be regarded as extremely satisfactory; the more so as,
in addition to ordinary maintenance, it is claimed that a
large amount of extraordinary work was done, so that,
turning to the balance-sheets, these figures show up :
Value of assets, Dec., 1903 .. .. £191,716
June, 1905 .. .. 230,804
Eighteen months’ gain.. .. £39,088
And this is after writing oft' £11,492 for depreciation. So
far State control has certainly justified itself; and in view
of the awful mess into which the mills and the co.’s had
got, the yarn that “ Private Enterprise can always do it
better ” is made to look very foolish.

Maoriland Premier Seddon is going to relieve
Australia of a little of its accumulated cash ; a £500,000 4
per cent, debenture issue, repayable in 1921, has been
underwritten in Melbourne by Thoneman, who handles
more of these deals in Australia than any other half-
dozen. Minimum is fixed at 101}; and the debentures
carry some options of value. The remarkable thing
under the circumstances is that Seddon should have
regarded underwriting as necessary at all ; if he didn’t get
very favorable terms for the work, it looks like giving
money away. The return at the minimum works out at a
fraction over £3 17s. per cent.

Australian fire and marine insurance co.’s had a
moderately good time last year, but not so good as in
1904, when their profits were something unusual. The
past four years’ aggregate record reads like this :
1902 .. ..£284,474 1 1904 .. ..£381,378
1903 .. .. 261,306 | 1905 .. .. 317,374
But included in the profits for 1905 is £10,559 distri-
buted among policy-holders as a bonus, leaving available
for shareholders £306,815. This amount has been dis-
posed of in this way
Dividends ‘. .. £158,084 = 51 '5 per cent.
Added,to Reserves .. 148,731 = 48-5 „
The very satisfactory lay-by of nearly 50 per cent, of the
profits is the best of proof that the Australian fire insur-
ance co. is just as deserving of respect as the Australian
life insurance co. There are two or three Australian fire
offices whose one idea seems to be to grab profits ; but the
vast majority of them are steadily accumulating reserves,
and giving policy-holders an additional guarantee that
their claims will be met, even if something abnormal in the
way of disaster arrives. It is true that no Australasian
office has funds,of two or three millions, like some of the
British and foreign offices. But the Australasian offices
■ haven’t the corresponding risks either. In nearly
every case their available resources (apart from
calls) are already' greater in proportion to pre-
mium income (and, therefore, also in proportion
to risks, assuming that the premiums are the right
size) than those of many British and foreign offices
of large figures and high repute. For comparison, take
the Commercial Union, one of the best of the British
offices. It does a general business ; but add the paid
share capital to the general reserve, and pile the two on
top of the fire fund, and the aggregate represents only
about 126 per cent, of a year’s fire premiums ; while the
shareholders’ funds of the New Zealand Co. represent no
less than 143 per cent, of a year’s premiums, and of the
South British 149 per cent. Other offices show up equally
well. Australian offices, then, even if they don’t yet
reckon their funds by millions, have already more funds
in proportion to risks than many of the foreign offices of
best repute.
As to individual co.’s, this is the position as
shown by the accounts published during last year :

Some of these co.’s have capitalised profits. The Colonial
Mutual, with an original paid capital of £37,500, has
applied £62,500 of profits to capital. The Australian
Mutual has capitalised £56,250. The Mercantile Mutual
has treated £37,500 in the same way in the past eight
years ; and similarly the Australian Alliance has increased
its capital from £50,000 to £125,000. The dividends shown
above are on the total capital no matter how provided ;
while the profits shown are net after deduction of bonuses
to policy-holders and amounts written off. In the case of
the Farmers’ Co-operative (M.L.), shareholders receive a
6 per cent, dividend and a bonus calculated on the amount
they have paid in fire premiums.

The expense rate varies to a great extent according to
the character of the business which the office pursues
with most energy. The Colonial Mutual shows a high
rate nowadays, "partly because it has been laying itself
out for accident and guarantee business, in addition to
fire and marine. The Mercantile Mutual and Australian
Mutual show high rates largely because they ferret out
the suburban property risks—which seem to be remark-
ably fine risks—at present, anyway". Generally SDeaking,
the" office with the high expense rate shows the biggest
profits in proportion to premium income. But in the
matter of aggregate profit the co.’s which don’t spend so
much in selecting risks are at the top. Of course, they are
also liable to be struck by the greatest disaster.
As mentioned just now, 48'5 per cent, of total
net profits were laid by during the year ; and the 16 co.’s
owned this virtue in the following order :

In nearly every instance the co. which is putting the most
aside is also the co. which is getting the largest increase
of business ; and that is just as it ought to be.
In connection with most co.’s it is a fair thing
for the investor to consider not only what return the
dividend gives on current price of stock, but also what re-
turn the total profits, divided and undivided, represent.
But it isn’t much use applying this test to fire and marine
insurance stocks ; fire and marine insurance business is to
a great extent a gamble, and one year’s profits, or excess
of profits over dividend, have to be set against probable
losses the next year, and the year after that. But there
is this for the comfort of stockholders : no Australian
co. has shown a loss during the past two years, and only
one in the year before that.

In spite of the much improved position of Queensland,
these figures Show little change ; in fact, the profits are
less than those for the corresponding part of the previous
two years. Gross profits' are, however, greater, but
expenses have increased, probably as the result of opening.
new branches. Gross profits show, after paying interest,
no less than £3 9s. p.c. p.a. on the entire assets, which
ought to mean that the assets are a remarkably sound
and productive lot; but it is as yet a little bank with
branches scattered from Cooktown to Sydney, and so the
expenses eat up nearly 75 per cent, of these gross profits.
Net profits are therefore pretty poor ; on the basis of
capital and reserves, they pan out as follows :
June, 1902 .. £3 12 1 p.c. June, 1904 .. £3 16 11 p.c.
Dec., 1902 .. 313 7 „ Dec., 1904 .. 4 2 0 „
June, 1903 .. 314 8 „ June, 1905 .. 316 0 „
Dec., 1903 .. 4 3 0 „ Dec., 1905 .. 31611 „
Still the balance-sheet figures indicate more progress than
that, so far as last half-year is concerned :
Dec., ’O4. Dec., ’O5.

Advances .. .. 303,829 342,567 Inc. 38,738
Premises .. .. 25,510 27,400 Inc. 1,890
The substantial increase in advances should mean better
profits. But there is apparently room for more advances,
for the liquid assets still represent 40 per cent, of all
debts to the public; and even in a conservatively
managed bank that proportion should hardly be thought
necessary, unless, of course, the amount of deposits at
call is abnormal. By reason of the high expense rate,
the Bank of North Queensland doesn’t offer anything
alluring to shareholders; but so far as the public is
concerned, a small bank in which the shareholders’ funds
bulk so large is safer than a big bank in which those
funds are only a drop in the bucket. In this case, all the
non-liquid assets could shrivel up about a third, and the
public money would still be intact.

Of the half-year’s profits £437 arise from the sale of some
of the A.D. and M. Bank shares previously written up,
which shows that the writing-up wasn’t excessive. But
even apart from that the profits show a handsome in-
crease. Some trustee co.’s make handsome increases at
the expense of subsequent periods, but the T. E. and A.
doesn’t appear to be that sort of co. A part, at least, of
the improvement is due to its rapidly-increasing connec-
tion. These figures show some details :

The profits on shareholders’ funds were so small 10 years
ago because the assets were then much over-valued, and
were subsequently written down. Whether the assets
are now worth what they stand at in the balance-sheet
(and therefore whether the reserves are real) it is not
possible to tell from the accounts, because £65,000 of
the whole £113,299 is represented by freehold property,
and only the rent received from premises not used by the
co. is shown. That means that the co. does not charge
itself with rent, which of course also partly accounts for
the very low expense rate. Nevertheless, considering
the increase in business, the expenses have in the past
five years moved up very little, the increase being more
than covered by increased interest earnings, leaving the
whole of the extra commissions as clear profit. The
substantial growth of this co.’s business is something to
be specially glad about, because it gives the public more
details regarding its position than almost any other
trustee co. in Australia.

The shareholders’ funds (capital £30,000 and reserves)
only earned £4 4s. sd. per cent, last year, and even then
nothing was written off buildings and fixtures, which stand
at £71,000. (In addition to capital and reserves, the co.
works with £21,000 of debentures.) Possibly the co. is
setting’ unearned increment against wear and tear of
premises ; but wean and tear is a certain thing, and un-
earned increment isn’t; and, anyhow, if there has been
any unearned increment the profits (mostly from rents)
should be looking up, and they are not. But if, taking
all this into account, the dividend is barely earned, sup.
posing it is even barely earned, the co. is nevertheless
doing some very good work in promoting little shows
which are calculated to give the Stinking Fish party a
better opinion of the country ; and (still to prove what
good work Australia can do> it pays its printer to turn
out the most artistic little bahmce-sheet issued in the
Commonwealth. Secretary Hayes deserves most of the
credit for these things. He’s a great worker for his city.

The capital is £962,500, of which £550,000 is in pref.
shares and £412,500 in ordinary shares; on the latter,
nothing has been paid since 1900. In addition to the
share capital, there is £79,600 of debenture stock,
redeemable Dec. 31st, 1907. The co.’s year, it will
be noted, closes on June 30; so that the year’s profits
are not swollen by the high metal prices which have ruled
during the past six months. The average obtained for
lead for the year to June last was £l2 Bs. 6d. ; and, though
that was nearly £1 per ton higher than in the preceding
three years, it is probably not above normal. But while
through the closing of the year at June 30th the accounts
do not show the benefits of the recent metal boom, they
do not show either the results of the creep in the mine
which occurred just after that date, and which has
restricted output ever since. As a result of that move-
ment, which not only disturbed the hauling shaft
but also affected the surface works, the co. has been hit
two waj's: its costs have been increased, and to a
great extent it has missed the markets when the markets
have been at their best. Besides the amounts shown
above as written off, considerable sums (not always speci-
fied, but amounting to £18,747 in the last year) have been
written off special works. The total written off looks
exceedingly heavy, and amounts to the sum spent on
capital account during the year. But, though it looks
heavy, it represents less than 7 per cent, of the book
value of mine and plant, and that certainly isn’t too
heavy. It only looks heavy because most mining
co.’s don’t attempt to write off enough from their
wasting' securities. But, though what the Sul-
phide Corporation is doing is no doubt right in
theory, it is mighty rough on ordinary shareholders, at
whose expense the directors practise this virtue. Whether
their prospects will ever be much brighter than they are
now is doubtful; certainly capital expenditure will
always be high, and, under the present policy, their share
of the profits is mopped up in providing the money to
earn divs. for the pref. shareholders. Possibly with the
metals at the top of a boom the ordinaries may get a
bite ; and there is no telling, of course, what metallurgi-
cal developments the future holds. Apart from that, the
ordinary shareholder’s chances of anything more than a
very occasional div. are cold—bitterly cold.

The Bulletin suspects the directors of being humorous
jolly millers. Last year they recommended alO per cent,
div., but the shareholders decided to take 15 per cent. Now,
with a loss shown, the directors scold the shareholders
for paying “ such a large dividend against the directors'
recommendation.” Then, having scolded the share-
holders for grabbing £2250 when £2342 net was earned,
they themselves proceed to recommend that £1125 be
grabbed, though nothing at all has been earned. Still,
the co. is in a good financial state ; its capital is only
£15,000, so its reserves exceed its capital ; moreover, no
less than £17,608 of its resources are in cash, while it owes
practically nothing. The past year’s misfortune is said to
have resulted from a slump in the markets after the year’s
stocks had been purchased ; and that raises a question as
to how co-operative the co. really is.

The comparison between the profit per ton in the two
parts of the half year is striking. The upward rush of the
metal markets has been wholly responsible. In the first
four weeks (July 1-29) the average price of lead
was £l3 10s.; of silver, 2s. sd. (fine). For the
last six weeks the averages have sky-rocketted
to £l6 13s. and 2s. Bd. Of the £1 2s. 6d. per ton profit,
the rise in metals was responsible for about 9s 9d. Like-
wise the fall in metals of the same size, which is bound to
come, will knock off 9s. 9d. From the profit shown above
(£34,323) there has to be deducted something for wear
and tear, office exes., etc., leaving about £30,000 net, not
quite equal to 4s. 6d. per share. Costs (including
realisation charges) for the early pari of the half-year were
£1 14s. per ton ; for the last part, £1 13s. 7d. Thi= ,-hows
a slight improvement ,“but there is none in the extraction
of metals or in value of ore. With lead at £l3 10s. and
silver at 2s. sd. (and even these prices are above normal),
the Broken Hill North would show a gross profit of
£28,000 and a net profit of, say, £23,000 on such an out-
put as it had last half-year, or rather under 3s. 6d. per
share per half-year.

When the metal boom breaks there won’t be a
train fast enough to take away the people who will want
to get from underneath. At the end of last week the
lead and silver markets sagged a little ; and, though the
movement wasn’t at all well-defined and a partial recovery
followed, the rush to get out was pathetic. From the
925. reached by B.H. Souths just before the Christmas
break-up, there was a topple to 80s. buyers ; from 85s.
6d. for contribs. the market went smash to 735. B.H.
Props., sold up to 795. the other day, were hurriedly
thrown at the market for 71s. If you hold Barrier stocks
and are not a very swift man, the safest thing is to camp
on the steps of the Stock Exchange.

C.S.A., Cobar (N.S.W.), still improves ; latest
assays from the south drive at 450 ft. level show 60 per
cent, lead and 7dwt. gold. It seems almost determined
that the drills shall go into the lower levels, which is a
pity ; but probably the letting of the contract before the
huge width of the ore bodies at the present level was
exposed is to blame in the matter. Seeing that
C.S.A. has caught on with the public, it might
be well, in the whirl of general excitement, to
again bring clearly under notice that there is
neither indication nor probability of the C.S.A. lode
extending over the 200,000 acres of country that either
have been or are being poked under the public’s nose.
Taking a running view of the situation, it can be summed
up this way. On the north of C.S.A.,>he North and
Trewenack’s and Doyle’s blocks are in direct line, and
hold an excellent position. On the south Andrew’s and
Central Blocks can be reckoned as being on the same
basis. Outside these blocks, which, including the C.S.A.
proper, aggregate roughly 600 acres, there isn’t,
an outcrop that can even be reasonably supposed
to have am connection with the C.S.A. lode.
This isn’t asserting that parallel ore bcvlies of value do
not exist ; but the policy of bringing disconnected areas
into direct connection with the' C.S.A. and pushing them
into the flotation stage on the reputation of a good mine
like the C.S.A., can’t be hit with too heavy a hammer.
And even the C.S.A., though it may be a huge concern,
has its possible disappointments—only the one level has
yet been probed, and it is extremely probable that the
lode is richest at that point. But, so far as the C.S.A. is
concerned, it can now be regarded as a proved mine ; it is
the litter that surrounds it that the public ought to be a
lot more careful about.

C.S.A. South, a local (Cobar) syndicate of 64
shares, had a prompt |move last week from £4O to £6O
per share. Seeing that the leases are on the eastern
boundary of C.S.A. Central, which absorbs all the ground
in that direction with a decent chance of catching the
extension of C.S.A. lode, the market move seems to have
been quite unwarranted. South is essentially a gamble ;
it may have a parallel lode, but even if it has, there isn’t
anything yet to say what the values are. At any rate,
the shaft has been sunk over 80ft. where the lode ought
to be if it is anywhere in the block, and it isn’t there.
o*oo
Budgery, Hermidale (N.S.W.), a recent
flotation, was previously referred to as going into a
limited company of 100 shares, each £l5. These shares
now stand at £4O. Like C.S.A. and others, Budgery was
abandoned years ago ; but recent assays of oxidised iron
ore taken from the dumps show from 13dwt. to 23dwt. gold
and some silver. Present shaft will be sunk a further
depth, and then crosscuts will be run out. Sorenson
worked the show years ago, and he may know how wide
the lode is, but, apparently, nobody else does. The sur-
face indications point to a big thing, but that will not be
definitely known until things are straightened out.

Again a Sydney daily paper booms the notion of
extracting gold from sea-water, but unkindly omits all
mention of its old stable-mate, the idea of getting sunshine
from cucumbers. It seems that an effort really is to be
made to get the gold from the water on the N.S.W. coast.
A good claim has been pegged out. The ore hod.v is of
remarkable extent and lives to a great depth. If the
calculations aren’t all wrong, some millions of pounds
worth of gold flow into Sydney harbor every year. And
Owe’Sullivan never floated a loan on the strength of that
magnificent natural resource !

Charters Towers’ tonnage for 1905 was 16,681
tons short of 1904, and returns were £81,500 less, partly
due to the accumulated tailings dumps having been used
up. The mills treated 224,519 tons for 171,5290 z., worth
£581,670 ; C3 7 anide dealt with 227,494 tons of residues for
£186,647 ; and 6575 tons sent to the smelters returned
45,8550 z., valued at £179,997, a total of £962,240 for the
year. The average value of stone was 18dwt. 19gr., worth
£3 ss. lid. Residues cyanided yielded 16s. sd. per ton,
making a total of £4 2s. 4d. per ton of stone treated.
* * * *
Method of handling mines on Charters Towers
has improved of late, due, no doubt, to the set-back the
field received when its boom burst. Throughout the
large properties systematic development has taken the
place of pig-rooting and gouging out rich patches. Still,
though share values have increased, as far as dividends
go 1905 does not compare favorably with previous .year ;
but an immense amount of necessary and hitherto
neglected development work has been done. Amount
paid last year was £219,610, against £399,128 in 1904, a
shortage of £179,518. Of this, that brilliant shooting star,
the Queen Cross, was responsible for £157,500 ; divs. from
that co. slackened off from £220,000 to £62,500. Brilliant
Central dropped from £60,000 to £27,500 ; Brilliant St.
George, from £70,200 to £43,200 ; Ruby P.C., from £6250
to £1250 ; Ruby United, from £BOOO to £lOOO ; Day Dawn
Gold Mines, from £2492 to calls ; and Band of Hope,
from £7500 to', reconstruction. On the other hand,
Brilliant Block paid £5OOO instead of £2500, Block and
Wyndham £24,920 against £12,460, Queen Central £6750
against £2550. Added to these are recent arrivals for
1905—Golden Alexandra, £8750; Mills United, £15,000;
New Queen, £4000; Phoebe, £14,000; and Victory, £5OOO,
Last year’s calls ran to £93,877 ; the year before the3' ran
to £83,067. The increase of £lO,BlO can be accounted for
by the flotation of 22 new and old shows.

Charters Towers’ mills for December crushed
21,430 tons for 15,8070 z., worth £62,753 ; cyanide treated
18,830 tons residues for 85830 z., worth £16,975; and
smelters’returns brought the month’s total to £86,512.
Calls ran to £6520, and dividends to £35,100. Contribu-
tors towards the divs. :—Mills United, £15,000 ; Victory,
£5OOO ; New Queen, £4OOO ; Brilliant St. George, £3600 ;
Brilliant Central, Brilliant Block, and Golden Alexandra,
£2500 each.

Day Dawn P.C., Charters Towers, got into the
limelight lately' through cutting an unknown reef at
1340 ft. vertical. The No. 2 underlie, down 1060 ft. from
the No. 3 straight shaft, was being continued to pick up
the North Australian reef * 250 ft. further out, when the
unexpected happened. Nev? find is going very flat. On
north side of the underlie shaft (Bft. by Oft. in size) there is
18in. of stone showing, but it dwindles away to 6in.
before it gets across the shaft. Nothing is known as to
the dip or permanency of the find, as a slide has tossed
the reef about. Intended to open out and prospect. A
trial parcel of 4 tons 9cwt. gave 28oz. mill gold ; this is
considered a genuine trial. Unless this new find turns
up trumps, the co. will be at a standstill for want of
stone. Last month the P.C. turned out and crushed at
its own mill 152 tons for 1540 z. Hardly enough to keep
30 head of stampers going 1
* * •* *
Band of Hope, Charters Towers, is in distress.
Last call of 2d. is about to be made, so it is proposed to
issue an additional 30,000 £1 shares liable for 10s. This
will bring' the capital to £90,000. For the past six months
681 tons were treated for £1289. The top ground has
been given over to tributors, who paid £577 in royalty on
559 tons that returned £2425. Prospecting has been con-
fined to the bottom formation at a vertical depth of
1429 ft. The underlie has been sunk 100 ft. on a large for-
mation with no stone. Two levels have proved, as far as
they have gone, that the southern ground contains
bunches of stone, but theyare unpayable—s69 tons gave
£912, equal to £ll2s. per ton. The underlie is being
continued, and a drive is to start north in search of the
payable stone now being worked by the New Queen. The
Band is the sort of co. that pays £7500 in divs. one year,
and reconstructs the next. That keeps the market see-
sawing.

O.K. township (N.Q.) mixed things a little
during the holidays. Apart from the resignation of
newly-appointed manager Gibson, whose zeal apparently
outran his many other virtues, the two-up schools were
responsible for a shooting sensation, and the local lotion
induced a marvellous crop of fights. A local correspondent,
writing in a casual vein and describing the holiday events,
says : “ The hard-pressed policeman went in for a bit of
‘ biff,’ and settled his man in three hard-fought rounds, a
victory he richly deserved ” —which seems to indicate the
difference between being run in and knocked out. While
the new raw township is gathering itself together, and the
Board is looking fora metallurgist, R. Hancorne has li.'.-u
appointed surface foreman, and J. Thompson, of Char ms
Towers, takes the position of underground manager.
Cause of Keith Maitland Gibson’s resignation will doubt-
less transpire presently. Asserted, however, that the
Board insisted upon Gibson confining development to the
rich portions of the mine, but that Gibson would have
none of that. This seems a queer tale in view of the
trouble with Gibb; but, all the same, it is not an
improbable one.
The Zinc Corporation’s latest reacli-out is after
the Mt. Garnet Freehold (N.Q.), for which, subject to
tests, the Baillieu-Robinson syndicate offers £50,000.
When Albert Vollenweider found it he thought he had
“ another Broken Hill ” ; then copper looked best, and
extravagant works were put up to get out that metal,
and over a quarter-of-a-million’s worth was shipped ; after
that, when the copper had mostly turned into zinc with-
out the shareholders getting a bean, the debenture-
holders foreclosed. There is a very big body of ore, but
it is hard, and unless it proves unexpectedly amenable to
treatment by the processes which the zinc crowd com-
mands, no business will be done.

Croydon (N.Q.) has been nearly at a standstill
for want of water ; though the first 11 months of 1905 had
an output of 64,0790 z., the total returns for December
only reached 7300 z. The aggregate from the mills,
64,8090 z., is, however, 64410 z. ahead of the previous
year’s, notwithstanding that about 7000 tons less were
treated. Total value, from mills and cyanide, was
£142,483. The mill returns give an average of £4 7s. Id.
per ton, or Us. ahead of the 1904 average. There are
some tid3 T -sized parcels waiting for water ; so, with pros-
pects of good developments at the south end of the Golden
Gate line, 1906 should show up well—always provided
the droughty field gets decent treatment in the matter
of moisture.

Morphett’s Mfc. Elliott mine, near the Hamp-
den, Cloncurry (Q.), has been snatched up by John
Moffatt and A. Linedale, and placed like hot cakes by
TOlhurst and Keats, of Melbourne. Float is also pretty
warm ; 66,000 £1 shares, and only 26,000 to the public,
while £5OOO cash trickles towards the promoters. Banana-
landers, however, were on the feed, prompted probably
by the success of the O.K. and Mt. Molloy.
What helped the float was a report by A. E. Savage, for-
merly of Cockle Creek, who works out 'the ore body as
having a length of 60ft. by 40ft. down to 105 ft. This gives
a block of 15,040 tons, and Savage thinks it will run 20
percent, copper and yield £168,000. Mining he puts at
205., smelting at the mine 455., and freight and realisa-
tion on 2800 tons of black copper at £ll a ton. Total
exes., £79,550 ; leaving a net profit of £88,450, or £5 18s.
per ton. .

W.A. gold production for December was
162,0900 z. fine, bringing up the year’s tally to 1,955,3140 z.,
'or 27,9160 z. less than for 1904. On the other hand, divs.
for 1905 pan out £2,353,815, against £2,050,559, or an
increase of £303,256. This means, reckoning from the
value of gold won, that each ounce cost 60s. lOd. in 1905,
against 645. sd. in 1904. Since 1886 the amount of fine
gqld reported is 14,871,6850 z., worth £63,170,900, and the
amount of divs. distributed £13,943,530. The cost per oz.
has, therefore, been 665. 2d., exclusive of the cash pro-
vided by Bull Cohen and other speculators.
* •* * *
W.A. divs. for January were £261,003 as against
£222,325 for same month last 3 r ear. Mines responsible
are : —Great Fingall £87,500, Associated Northern £52,500,
Ivanhoe £50,000, Kalgurli £45,000, Sons of Gwalia
£24,375 and Black Range £l6BB. Ida H. may still pay a
div., as it did last year ; but Golden Pole is, temporarily
at least, out of the running.
* • * * .
Kalgurli is in the strongest position of any mine
in W.A. Its ore reserves amount to 548,000 tons, worth
£1,096,000 net after paying all expenses on mine. Even
after pairing London exes., this would leave about £8 a
share. It will take five years to treat these reserves.
Recently a new lens of pay ore was struck in sinking the
main shaft, so everything points to a long life for the
mine. It is interesting to note that during last year the
reserves were increased by 139.000 tons, and the extrac-
tion values by 3s. per ton, bringing them up to 61s. As
compared with the Kalgurli, Hainault has four years’
reserves, and Great Fingall three years’, all the other big
mines less. Manager reckons that the new plant
will yet treat 9000 tons monthly, and that the current
year’s profit will be about £200 ; 000. It is possible that
the shares will be split into tens, and this would provide
a far wider market for the scrip, as they are at present
out of reach of small investors and speculators.
*** * ,
Ivanhoe, Kalgoorlie, has got its main shaft
down 1520 ft., and is vigorously developing all the levels
down to 1370 ft. In the upper levels the east lode cuts
off, going north, before reaching the boundary, but, as a
continuation of this lode has been pierced by boreholes
from the 800 ft. and 1000 ft. of Great Boulder’s Hamilton
shaft, only 50ft. from Ivanhoe boundary, drives are to be
put in at the lower levels to see if it exists there. Should
this prove so, mine’s ore reserves will be greatly aug-
mented. The whole 15 slimes concentrators have been
installed, and the treatment plant is complete.
* * * *
North End, Kalgoorlie, in winch some Adelaide
speculators are interested, is suffering from coo much
management. Some of the original holders, who have a
controlling interest in the show, are continually
“ chipping in,” with the result that Woodward, the
manager, has resigned, and most of his nominees have
also gone. While this sort of control continues, shares
are good enough to leave alone. Mine is all right so far as
proved, but there are no reserves opened up, and concern
can’t go on like that. It was officially stated that the 10-
head mill ran only 102 hours, and crushed over 400 tons,
or at the rate of 3000 tons a month. The figures are
wrong, as future returns will prove.
• * + *
Hannan’s Star, Kalgoorlie, has been successfully
reconstructed, and 210,165 shares have been issued as
against 212,200 in old co. Concern started with £17,300,
besides £3500 brought forward from old co. There is still
a 2s, assessment outstanding on the scrip. Mine looks a
hopeless proposition on prospects, but may provide a
gamble now and then when the market is brisk.
* • « *
Sons of Erin, Higginsville (Higgins’ new Wes-
tralian find), continues to open out well. At the 80ft.
level 60ft. has been driven, the reef averaging 2oz. for 2ft.
wide. Many leases have been pegged, and several of them
are turning out well. A battery is to be erected in the
district as soon as a supply of water is assured. In case
of urgent need Government intends laying pipes from
Lake Cowan, which is only' a few miles away.
Oroya Junior, Black Range (W.A.), a pup of
the Oroya, is being vigorously developed. Three shafts
are being sunk, and 40 to 50 men are at work. This is a
vary promising property of 148 acres, which will prolong
the life of the Oroy'a. At present the Oroya reserves tot
up about 18 months’ supply, but the bulk of the rich ore
of the wonderful shoot is depleted. On the south block
and on the Brown Hill the grade is very low.
■»•»•*
Northern Block Syndicate’s new show, the
Great Leviathan, Southern Cross (W.A.), is now crushing,
and the first return will be published next month. An
average of 15dwt. is looked for, but it is not expected
that more than 1000 to 1200 tons will be treated, as the
quartz is very hard. There are 10,000 to 12,000 tons of
ore in sight, and it is expected that this will yield
sufficient profit to repay all outlay, including the £BOOO
purchase money.
* * * #
Golden Pole, Davyhurst (W.A.), during Decem-
ber treated 1480 short tons for 16850 z. worth £6200, or
83s. a ton. The profit for the month was about £2BOO.
Sooner or later a new treatment plant will have to be
installed, as the antediluvian battery is in a chronic state
of collapse. Half the mill is shut down, so that in future
only about 900 tons will be treated monthly, and the
profit will be reduced to £l3OO or £l4OO. It will be seen
from this that divs., when resumed, will be on a very re-
duced scale, more especially as more money is to be spent
on development.

London Financial Times of December 8 has
the report of the Australian Commonwealth Trust, Ltd.
the sponsor of the Victorian deep-lead shows promoted
by Bewick, Moreing and Co. when they got the London
and Globe assets for a mere song. A chastened smile
must come over Hoover’s face when he reads the report.
He of all men must know that the water at Moolort is
almost as far from being beaten as it was when his firm
took up Whitaker Wright’s lot of deep-lead shows. Theelos-
ing down of the Moolort mine, and the shifting of the plant
to,the Loddon,Valley is not told of, though a good many
thousands went the way of the Plunger before such a
step was taken. The Trust does not dwell on matters of
this kind. Its purpose is “to secure powerful concerted
efforts under a single management, among separate co’s
covering many miles of the lead, and to undertake
financial business in connection with deep lead
co.’s.” But (jQY can concerted action be possible at
Moolort and the Berry United when about 15 miles of lead
n-v held by the Trust separate the claims? Co. has
•ri'Ms in a total of 26 miles of lead at widely separated
points on the Berry system. It can show its shareholders
nothing at the Creswick end, for the boring at the Berry
Consolidated and the shaft-sinking at the Berry United
only mean, punching the bag to get the muscle up—it
isn’t the fight with the water at all. At the Moolort
section the Trust can exhibit the Moolort shut down, the
Loddon y alley pumping and shaft-sinking to get depth in
order to cross the lead, and at the Victorian Deep Leads
partial pumping. Therefore it is as hard to guess when
the mines will get into the wash as it is to fix when Willis
will be back.
* * » *
The row over Berry Consols Extended, at Bal-
larat, went on wrong lines. It is no good to carp at a
manager getting a decent wage, as did the principal
critic. Berry Extended is a great mine in point of size,
and requires skilful handling. To hint at giving a
manager who has 300 men under his charge £3 a
week is to turn the position into ridicule —unless £3-
a-week management is wanted. As the result of
miserable cheese-paring on the part of miserable direc-
torates, the type of alluvial mine managers has not
improved, nor will it do so until it is realised that in the
big alluvial mines men are wanted with engineering
skill as well as solid practical training-. Take
the problem of stresses and strains that has
been provided in the Berry Extended, with its
heavy ground. The worry of battling with that difficulty
alone was worth the £9 a week paid to manager Ward,
even if he had not to think about opening up fresh
ground and trying to keep calls from a hungry crowd of
shareholders. Gold isn’t so easily won, nor is it so plen-
tiful, in the deep Victorian leads as in the shallow ground,
and it costs more to get. Until that is recognised,
there is sure to be disappointment and unjust complain-
ing.
* * * *
Pound Hill, Smythesdale, (Vic.), is an example
of the Victorian practice of putting a few pounds into a
mine on the strength of a few tons of crushing dirt going
a few dwt., and then trusting to luck to pick up a shoot
of stone lower down. It would never do to wait till
the No. 1 and 2 crosscuts had proved the stone to
be worth milling. No, a battery must be got. If memory
serves right, there had also to be a shivoo over the
blessed thing, at which the natives and their best girls
had to pose for the camera fiend. Pound Hill battery
first crushed 150 tons and got 16f0z., and now it turns
out 18oz. from 100 tons. Shares flopped faster than the
stampers fell, and an anxious crowd wants to know how ;t
was that the quartz didn’t turn out as well as that of the
Jubilee.

The St. Helens, one of the recently-floated Tas.
tin properties, is among the most hopeless-looking in the
basket. Top portion of the property (originally known
as Garter’s Marsh) is a small, confined, button-grass flat
of little depth, with a narrow run of tin. It has been
worked by local miners for years off and on—when water
was obtainable—and is of no value to anyone but
“ hatters,” and but tucker to them. On this flat the co.
was floated. Afterwards some other leases were included,
about 11 miles lower down, on the Scamander River.
This lower ground consists of narrow flats ; the best block
is 8 acres, and is studded and confined by rocky bars,
which diminish what little payable wash there is. A good
water supply has been brought in, and everything of that
sort done in a workmanlike manner by a hard-working
manager. Little fall is, however, obtainable for the tail
race on the lower ground, and there is only 60 or 70 feet
of pressure. It is doubtful whether the water in present
race can be brought on to the top ground at all; anyhow,
no pressure can be obtained. Yet shares have been
boomed to a premium.
* * * » •
North Farrell (Tas.) has declared its first div.—
a little one of 3d. per share, it is true, but its own. Co.
is tremendously handicapped by the situation of the mine.
It wanted a 10-ton boiler, a few weeks ago, and had to pay
something like £llO to get it carted eight miles. To get
ore away, first the lessee of the eight miles of wooden
tramway between the mine and the Emu Bay line has to
get his “ cut ” ; then the Emu Bay Co. opens its mouth,
and it is hungry ; and after that the smelters have to be
argued with, and in making up a bill a custom smelter
can beat a lawyer any day. Result is that fine
concentration is practised; a few tons of firsts are
sent away crude, but most of the ore is reduced in
bulk from tons to one ton. Concentration costs under
the circumstances are remarkably low, 3s. 1 Jd. per ton of
crude ore. And mine costs would need to be low. Last
half-year the crude ore and concentrates dispatched
averaged 61‘820z. silver per ton and 59'51 p.c. lead. Total
contents, 50,1610 z. silver and 482'85 tons lead. At 2s. 4d.
per oz. for silver and £l4 10s. for lead (under the averages
for the term), the metals were worth £12,850. As a
matter of fact, they netted £7371. The people who owned
the ore, and mined it, and milled it got £7371 ; the people
who carted it a few miles and smelted it (and it is sup-
posed to be good smelting ore) took £5479. The
profit last half-year was only Is. 2jd. per ton ; and,
though the ore-faces are looking good at present, there
isn’t, much margin there to meet a metal-slump with.
Question is whether the co. can’t market its product
better. That is its big problem.

“RavX.”: After another run round Tas. tin-
mine floats, I agree with “East Coast Tasmanian ” (B.
28/10/’O5) as to Wvniford and Abbotsford and some others,
but think he, is wrong about Weldbrook. At any rate,
the late prospecting has proved to my mind (and that of
other practical men) that it is, at par value, a sound pro-
position as mining things go. As far as the Gladstone is
concerned, I don’t see how “East Coast Tasmanian”
knows that the bore plan in the office is incorrect. lam
inclined to take the office figures. However, I can’t
swear to anything, and, of course, on this depends the
future of the mine. As far as the dredge itself is con-
cerned, as I said at first, in the face of much ignorant
opposition, it will treat the wash (on the bore figures) at
a handsome profit. St. Helens scrip is very strongly
held by good people in Melbourne, and they deserve
sympathy for having such a show put upon them.
Briseis Extended is about to make a sink, which it
intended doing before ; this will put it on much better
drifts. A few good returns can be looked for, and the
shares will have a market rise. It is true that a few holes
were put down in the outside flats years ago—some very
unsatisfactory—by Knox, Schlapp and Co. and others,
but the ground cannot be said to have been bored.
Shareholders may get their money back, but the mine
does not improve upon further acquaintance.

failed to perform. It is in the hands of high-grade busi-

Some excitement is brewing in the inter-State
carrying trade ; Scott Fell and Co., daring people who
can give points to most in the game of chartering, have
made a contract with the Broken Hill Proprietary cover-
ing two years’ coal supplies, with carriage of coke to
Port Pirie and 150,000 tons of back-loading. It means
handling 325,000 tons in all. Having gone so far into the
business, Scott Fell propose to go the whole hog, and,
with a new “ Commonwealth line,” have a mind to cut
into practically the whole inter-State trade. The “ ship-
ping ring,” though it isn’t a remarkably prosperous com-
bination, will give them a handy lever to work with for
a start ; and a battle will be put up for the improved
Queensland business which everybody expects.

Electric haulage is one of the best paying in-
vestments for every mine in which the wash-dirt has to be
hauled from a greater distance than 2000 feet. The actual
saving effected at the Berry Consols Extended Mine,
Allendale, amounts to £3O per week at a distance of 3000
feet; at the Great Southern Consols Mine, Rutherglen, it
runs into £45 per week, at a distance of 5000 feet ; in both
instances the necessary plant which was installed to
replace the manual labor has cost but £l2OO. Experience
has proved that at a distance of 4000 feet electric haulage
cost a quarter of that of horse traction and a tenth of hand
trucking. The Charlotte Plains and New Havillah Mines
at Moolort are the latest to adopt electric haulage, and
have again proved it to be highly satisfactory. The favor-
able results obtained with these installations are un-
doubtedly due in a great measure to the reliable and
smooth operation of the electric apparatus, especially the
locomotives adopted, which were all supplied and erected
by the Austral Otis Engineering Company, Limited, corner
of Hanna and Kavanagh-streets, South Melbourne, agents
for Ganz and Company, Budapest, Hungary. This firm has
devoted special attention to mine haulage problems, and
during their 14 years’ experience have brought up their
mine locomotives and other haulage apparatus to the
highest degree of perfection.* [2.]

Camping out has become quite a Christmas
craze in Melbourne, but camping is not always an
unmitigated joy, as a police court case at Min
Min demonstrates. The party of young ladies
and gentlemen, accompanied by a sufficiency of
fathers and chaperones, went to dwell in the
wilderness near a creek, and having set up their
little Eden, far removed, as they thought, from
the haunts of men, they had a good time for two
days. At noon on the third day the bulk of the
party, returning from an excursion, found two
chaperones withdrawn from the camp, one in
hysterics and the other in tears. The camp itself
was in possession of a great, red, bewhiskered
brute who had eaten nearly all that was eatable,
and had rolled on the rest of the tucker, and
was drunk and violent, and had the remainder of the
camp’s fermented and spirituous liquors gathered
about him for safety. The red ruffian defied all
authority, and resisted every attack. Once, when
the young gentlemen advanced upon him from
three directions, he stunned one with a lemonade ,
bottle, kicked another, and held a third in a
sitting position on the remains of the camp tire till
he was grievously discommoded. After that the
campers sat afar off —they had no gun—and the
young ladies wept, and prayed, and fainted more
or less, while the young men expostulated. The
red ruffian simply drank, lie had no time to
spare for argument. It ended in one youth riding
off on his bicycle for police assistance. The assist-
ance arrived next morning, with a dray, and
forind the bearded brigand still in possession and
dealing spiritedly with a small keg of beer, lie
resisted with such vigor that the police were com-
pelled to allow him to take the keg m the cart
with him. Nine weeks’ imprisonment followed,
and he seemed to think the night of wassail was
was worth it.
THE JERRY BUILDERS’ TOPHET.
“ David Richards ” : Apropos of the evi-
dence adduced during the inquest re a boiler at
Tallarook (Vic.), whereby three men were sent to
the Jasper boarding-establishment. I have seen
boilers belonging to engines on shearing sheds
(and it is a noticeable fact that the worst ones are
those on places owned by large financial com-
panies) which were a perpetual menace to all en-
gaged about the place, the plates being so eaten
away with age and rust that they were about half
the usual thickness. Almost every shed that in-
stalls machinery in place of hand-shears looks
round for a cheap second-hand engine, and mostly
gets it. Wool scours are also great offenders in
this way. What is the difference between the
owner of a station who, for the sake of a few
sovereigns, continually exposes his men to the risk
of sudden death, and the man who puts a bullet
through another for the sake of a few sovereigns ?
The Government, in place of so many rabbit in-
spectors and other superfluities, might very well
appoint boiler inspectors—men who know
the game—to visit shearing sheds and wool-
scours There are more surprising things than
rabbits to be found in the great boiled interior.
The rabbit, at all events, never bursts and kills
people.

“ Eiddal ” : Cocky for once wears the
smile of contentment. Never, to the knowledge
of the present generation, have the Victorian
crops been harvested so cheaply, or during such
even weather, while the yields have been on every
hand better than anticipated, and the best for the
last quarter-century. The New Year saw the
harvest* bagged, and the carting-in well on,
throughout the Kyabramapootra regions. Bank
balances were pretty well squared “ after harvest ”
last year (the waiting bank-managers saw to that),
and there should be some money to throw round
during ’OG. And butter cheques float about with
the frequency that gladdened traders’ hearts be-
fore the drought. Cocky is having a good time
in Northern Victoria —not a locust, not a squall,
not a bush-fire worth mentioning to mar his
profits. May he show that he deserves it !
♦ * * *
“ Chasselas ” : Re “ Nym.” on the sparrow
as an insect destroyer (B. 4/l/’O6). The sparrow
in his region must be a different bird from the
all-round curse that goes by that name here in
southern Victoria. I invested the hard-earned
proceeds of many Bulletin contributions in a
wind-mill, and went in for fruit-growing and rose
culture, but the sparrows destroyed every fruit-
bud on peach and plum trees, leaving the aphis a
very poor second in the wo;k of ruin. There’s no
reliable way of dealing with the sparrow nuisance,
as it is almost impossible to get these fowl to take
poison. Have known men to put poisoned wafer
near their roosts and never get a bird. Laying
poisoned grain results in the same failure. Have
poisoned a few by putting poisoned wheat in a
bag with a hole in it. But you need a new device
every day to get any result.
* * * *
“Mallet”: “ Wurrym ” takes exception
to statement that Westralia can’t grow its own
vegetables (B. 9/12/’O5), and says “any decent-
sized town has its vegetable supply.” Katanning,
the agricultural centre of the Great Southern Dis-
trict, has one miserable little shop, on the out-
skirts of the town, where vegetables and fruit are
retailed. The vegetables consist generally of two or
three dejected bunches of turnips and shrivelled
cabbages, and the fruit of some Tasmanian apples
and perhaps a very few oranges, at 2s. a dozen.
This, in spite of the fact that Piesse’s celebrated
orchard is only about 200yds. distant. In Wagin,
a similar state of affairs exists, and both these
claim to be decent-sized towns. In a store on the
line, and within 25 miles of Katanning, Swede
turnips (average weight 31b.) were being retailed
at 2d. a lb., and yet “Wurrym ” says vegetables
are “ cheaper than and equal to those I’ve met in
Victoria.” As a matter Of fact, nearly all the
cookies and residents in this district (Wagin) use
tinned vegetables, mostly imported from France.

“Dave H. ft. ” : In growing cereals, a
good or bad crop depends, in the outer-back,
almost entirely upon the manner in which the
crop is cared for. This fact, if demonstration were
necessary, is amply proved by the crop which has
this year repaid the efforts of Mr. J. R. Atkinson,
of Galambme, in the Mudgee district. Mr.
Atkinson is an enthusiastic advocate of the early-
sowing policy, and this season his wheat was
sprouting before most of the other settlers had
finished ploughing and otherwise preparing their
ground. Then, as soon as the young wheat com-
menced to stool, but before it had begun to spindle,
he let some sheep on to the field —between 200
and 300 to the acre—to eat the crop off. This was
repeated three or four times, Mr. Atkinson’s con-
tention being (and everyone who knows anything
of cultivation knows that it is correct) that the
repeated eating-down strengthens the roots (a
most necessary thing), and so fortifies the crop
against long spells of dry weather. The sheep
manure also does the crop incalculable good. In
this way he kills two fowls with one rock. Mr.
Anderson’s crop is this year one of the best in the
Mudgee district, and averages 30 bushels per Acre
—some of the worst parts yielding from five to six
bags per acre—remarkably good in so adverse a
season.
“D.H.R.” : i want to agree in a hurry
with “Nyrii ”'(B. 4/l/’O6) re the statement that
the sparrow- tribe keeps horticultural and other
spade-and-fork matters quite free of peach aphis,
and similar grub pests. I also want to put a word
in for that often-libelled bird, the jackass ; and I
am sure that many gardeners will fall over their
implements to. back me up. Jacky, besides
killing snakes (arid bullocks, as alleged some time
back—l believe he, also kills men) is particularly
partial to juicy grubs,: and when he lights on a
tree —and he has a habit of often lighting on trees
—soon clears it from one end to the other. As
“ Nym ” says, the way the sparrows (arid jack-
asses) devour the aphis is good to see.

“ Adelaide” : A veteran has been writing
to S. A. Register about immense snakes that once
grew near Adelaide. He grappled with one him-
self, brown, non-venomous,'lift, by 9jn. (esti-
mated), but it'got away while he went for a gun,
he having “no wish to be entangled in its folds.”
Is there any reason to suppose that Australia
(Southern Australia, anyway) has ever possessed
serpents that could hurt a man with their “ folds ” ?

S. 0. 0. Jessop writes from Lake Nash
Camooweal, too, is near The Edge. When I wrote (B.
2/11/’O5) that “ if anybody falls over the Edge of Nowhere,
it’s two years before you hear the thud,” I was going on
incorrect information. There is no thud. If a nigger be
so unfortunate as to get pushed over in fun, he becomes
desiccated, and blows drearily about in Space for ever.
He never lands on anything, for there’s nothing to land
on. There’s plenty of Space out here.
The man who founded Camooweal was blown up from
somewhere north of Adelaide. He was walking carelessly
about in a loose shirt when the eternal south wind caught
him up and hurtled him through a few hundred miles of
air. He was deposited on the site of the present post-
office, with only a tomahawk and a bottle of rum to begin
life afresh with. There was only the collar of his shirt
left, so he was considerably sunburnt. He died some
years ago, unlamented. The townspeople had a grudge
against him for discovering the place, and to show their
disrespect, nobody got drunk at his fuheral.
It’s a horrible thing, this south wind—a sort of endless
chain affair. Reminds me of a dog chasing its tail. I
believe that the for’ard part of the breeze caught up to
its tail long ago, and now cannot stop, but just goes on
whizzing round day and night. It simply won’t stop.
A man’s thoughts turn to suicide after a fortnight of it;
after that, to rum.
Every morning, before the wind gets too strong, small
boys drive the goats away—always against the wind.
There’s no occasion to go for them in the afternoon.
They blow back.
One day a Camooweal postal official noticed a strange
hat jammed against his fence. He looked inside it and
read “ Jim Redwax, Urandangie.” So he wired to his pal
, Jim, in “ The ’Dangie,” 160 miles away south, thus :
“Have you lost hat? One here. Think it’s yours.”
Back came the reply : “ Yes; blew away yesterday.
Please return by mailman.
It’s an amusing sight to see the crows walking home at
night, hanging on to the stubbles of grass with their
beaks and claws. They know that if they attempted to
fly they would be blown up to Papua in one act. These
crows know something.
A public meeting in Camooweal is a simple affair. You
just step to the edge of the pub verandah and yell,
“ Oomeanaveone.” A shout of any size is a serious
matter. Drinks are Is., and the glasses are Liliputian.
A bottle of beer costs 4s. But you can buy a fight for
nothing, and they are dear at that.
The postmaster is about seventeen different kinds of
official. About every three months he is notified that
besides his other duties he will have to be Assistant
Flagellator, Inspector of Snakes, Local Superintendent of
Shipping, and things of that sort. And yet he is always
most civil and obliging—a positive genius.
I’m sorry for Camooweal. It stands, a little shim-
mering group in a wind-swept wilderness, where
Life’s total sum
Is sleep, diversified with rum.
“AS”' Strange how the importing
mania clings to the Ma State. ,We cannot even
fight bunnv ourselves, but must import a scientist
to do battle for us. Rodier is here, and has con-
quered the rabbit on his own station m a scientific
manner. But there': is a cry for an imported
scientist with another imported disease, in Ihe
Origin of Species” (chap. 4, page 88) Darwin
wrote: — «,
And this leads me to a few words on what I call Sexual
Selection. This depends not on a struggle for existence,
but on a struggle between the males for possession of the
females. The result is, not death to the unsuccessful
competitor, but few or no offspring.
Rodier has increased this struggle between the
males by decreasing the number of females, thus
verifying Darwin’s assertion by actual practice.
He has, hence, acted on Darwinian principles, and
has amply demonstrated their efficacy. But the
able editors, and the city bushmen, and the flower-
pot farmers will have none of him. ihey must
have an imported Danysz, and an imported
disease.

“Mul” writes from beside a railway line
“Via’s" goanna (B. 28/12/’O5) is but a fair-sized one.
The record here (Hawkmount, North Coast railway) is
7ft. sin. measured from head to other extremity. Girth,
22in. ; contents, ’possum, bandicoot and sundries. He
had chased ’possum up starting signal post and was
caught by connections when signal was turning to “all
clear” for a train. I blocked train, known as No. 8
express passenger, two minutes getting goanna clear, and
had to send the cause of obstruction (i.e., the beastly
goanna) to the District Superintendent, to prove the
bona-fides of my explanation of delay. The D.S. sent it
to the Railway Jubilee Exhibition. If “ Via ” quotes B.
04/48910 Ry. he can obtain verification at either Sydney
or Newcastle offices.
Ticks fasten to goannas during the hibernating season,
and it is unusual to find one on the Coast without the
parasite. Wood-peckers in the warmer district keep the
goanna free from ticks. I have often watched, in early
spring, the goanna being cleaned of ticks by the ’pecker
Goannas will not touch wood-peckers’ nests.
This place is alive with the goanna pest. Have had to
discontinue using tallow for railway point-slides, as the
goannas sucked it and were caught in the act by move-
ment of switches when being “ set ” for a train to enter
loop or sliding. This, of course, prevented a “ true road”
until the goanna was removed.

The names proposed by the Commissioners
for the 134 shires to be proclaimed under the
N.S.W. Shires Bill make up a heterogeneous
collection. Some are Old World names, such as
Severn, Dumaresq, Bannockburn, and Gloucester,
but the great majority are of aboriginal origin,
more or less new. Among the more may be cited
Marthaguy, Titnbrebongie, Adjungbilly, Tanta-
wangalo, Goodradighee, and Cowcumballa, which
last will have a perilous escape of not being known
as Blessed Cucumber.

“Moulamein” : .Re diet of goannas (“Ed.,”
B. 16/11/’O5). Remember, in drought time, a
stagnant creek overgrown with a species of water-
plant, bearing a profusion of buttercup-like
flowers, and locally known, as “ ropeweed.” Into
this creek the starving sheep waded, enticed by the
floating green leaves, and were bogged or drowned
in great numbers. Was riding round it one day,
when, from a rotting carcass far out amid the
yellow flowers, an enormous, gorged goanna
wriggled lazily. Upon reaching the bank he
climbed a tree, and gazed slyly at me with an
“I have dined ” expression on his evil, crocodile-
like countenance. Was there again next after-
noon. Evidently made a point of swimming out
for his dinner each day, and then drifting sleepily
shoreward, filled with contentment and dead
sheep. The tenacity of life in the goanna is
aniazing, and the only thing about him that is
more amazing is the extreme age of some of the
sheep that he eats and the. extreme deadness of
his diet generally.

“ D.S.M.” : I have seen rabbits 12ft. up
in sandalwood trees, eating the bark, when there
was no feed on the ground. In the north of S. A.
once, I saw a rabbit that had evidently climbed a
tree in the night and couldn’t get down again.
He was running up and down a bough, on the
end of which was a hawk watching bunny intently.
Presently the bird worked his way up to the
rabbit, made a snatch, missed, and toppled off; but
at a second attempt he grabbed bunny by the
scruff of the neck, rose with him to a great height
in the air and dropped him. The hawk then
descended and proceeded to breakfast on broken
rabbit.

“D. H. R.” : Round about Narrabri
(N.S.W.), and, in fact, all through the district,
tlie rabbits are in millions and are rapidly in-
creasing. Bunny is making in from the plains to
the shelter of the pine-scrubs and the mighty sand-
ridges. The Pilliga scrub bids fair to become an
algebraic x before many years, on account of the in-
cursion of these predatory pests, who ringbark the
trees at the bottom, thus causing them to die. It is
absolutely unsafe for a horseman to ride in any of
the ridges, on account of the network of burrows
which extends on every side. Many accidents
have lately been reported through these cata-
combal circumstances. The newly-established
freezing works at Narrabri are in full swing ; and
some of the rabbiters are earning up to £4 and £5
per week.
AN INCONSIDERATE MAN.
“ 'Era’s the cows ready to milk, and yer father's
gone and hanged ’isself—the selfish brute! ”
“ Bunny ” : An outback State school
teacher recently received the following note from
a pupil’s mother, whom he had never seen :
I want to asked you did Annie Janie and Iserbeller tell
you that Jertie was leving- school be-couse she had to go
too service we not going to send Jertie today till we see
who carry these here yarns all the yarns are put on to
Jertie back. Plese give me the answer who told you that
Jertie was going to service did Annie Jane say that her
mother said that our Jertie was the biggest yarn carrier
at the school just tell me if she did. Plese giv me an
answer tonight by Ruby and now one elsei—Yoti'rs“Affec-
tionately, Mts. Fonvoxide;. ;
The curse of-small communities is gossip !
“D. Homfrey R.” : The new Liquor
Act will make very little difference in the grey-
and-blanky outback of N.S.W., where the only
consolation is oeer—when there is no whisky or
rum or brandy ; and where one, or the whole lot,
of them represents the sum total of enjoyment —
where .everyone drinks-to prevent himself thinking
about crow or rabbit or whirlwind, and where
everyone says “ Gr’ day, it’s ’ot ” to everyone else
in a,kind of mechanical way. Out in these realms
of spi and alcohol and jumbuck, the “ force ” finds
it much more convenient to have a drink itself at
a quarter to two in the morning, than to ask what
the publican is doing with; a light in the bar at
that hour. As for serving babies, in any out-back
town, boys of fourteen years of age can very often
be Seen drunk. The police, oh where are they ?
Ask of the servant maid on the wood-heap.

“ Nap.” : In Gippsland the mounted con-
stable who governs a large district exercises wide
discretionary powers. Was witness, the other
day, to a case in point. A man who had been on
the razzle for some time suddenly ceased liquoring
up and began “ seeing things, ” being on the verge
of d.t.'S. His friends, fearing homicidal mania,
sent for the officer of the law. The constable, not
liking to drag the sufferer 15 miles to the
lock-up on a roasting day, put his medical
knowledge -into practice. The victim was
first stripped and ordered to swim in the
creek for 15 minutes. Then three packets
of salts were dissolved in hot water, and the
snake-hallucinationist was made to swallow the
dose. A couple of stalwart acquaintances walked
him about until he became a changed charac-
ter ; then the constable returned to his home,
feeling that he had performed his duty efficiently.
Thereafter the patient was speedily clothed and
in his right mind. Had he lived in a city he
would have been lodged in gaol and had a bad
attack of what a prisoner once called “delicious
tremblings.”

“Bunny”: Be “Jimmie Parimkiri’s ”
remarks on the cultivation of native fruits and
flowers in our bush State school gardens. Note
these observations by J. H. Maiden, of Sydney
Botanic Gardens: —
It is a matter of common observation that a number of
raw vegetable products of mOre-or-less importance are
going to waste in Australia simply because our people are
ignorant of their properties and value. I can hardly cite
a better instance than that of Australian Sandofac : Here
we have a product absolutely and entirely identical in
chemical and physical properties with a well-known article
in regular demand. The price of this article at London
auction sales is shown by figures readily accessible, while
its ,cost ip Sydney is very much enhanced—yet we actu-
ally import from Algeria, via London,.at,X nig price, what
is common enough in parts of N.S. Wales, And to be had
for the gathering. '
By all mearife, let Ourchildren practise their nature
study largely upon native fruits, vegetables,
flowers, timbers, &c., for obvious reasons.
* ' * * *
“Splitter”: Some of us -had a fencing
contract near Cobar (N.S.W.), in 1878. We
devised all sorts of
schemes to prevent the
goannas robbing our camp
of the eatables, and most
of the schemes were use-
less. At last we had all
the items jointly and
severally on swaying
wires, and the goannas
even then often bested
us, leaving us without
our dinner. It was
nothing unusual when
we arrived at the tent
door to have to dodge a
whole tornado of goannas
rushing out and fleeing
like a -horizontal deluge
for the nearest tree. My
mate Sam had a cheery
habit of chasing the
beasts up the tree, and
as the hard-shell gentle-
man fiscally slackens
speed when he has got
up a ffew feet, not being
able to. see anything be-
hind him, an active man
can spring up and grasp
him by the tail, and with
a quick jerk fetch him
whack on the ground.
Samuel was usually suc-
cessful at this, and the
whoop he used to give
as he struck the earth’s
crust with the goanna's
head is something I can
hear in my dreams even
after all these years. But
Samuel fell in at last.
We came home to dinner
and the usual tally-ho
commenced. Samuel
caught his reptile all
right (a fairly large one),
but instead of being
banged on the ground it
somehow flew over his
shoulder and tried to
rush down his spine.
When Samuel’s grip on
the tail pulled it up it
naturally clawed all it
knqw at his back. If
he had let it go instantly it would have fled
down over his pants and struck out for the
Northern Territory, but in his excitement he
yelled and tried to tear it off, and this only made
it hold on harder. It took him j ust three seconds
to realise that it was cheaper to let go, but at the
end of that time his back looked as if it had been
harrowed. After that Samuel contented himself
with throwing things at the enemy.

“Ben Sun”: A variety of wine largely
sold in Vic. Mallee shanties is a fearsome com-
pound. A drunk on it has ten Stages; in this
order : the brotherly, the joyous, the argumenta-
tive, the combative, the assertive, the stony, the
cadging, the cunning, the yearnful, and finally the
recovery, during \yhich last stage a.man drops on
the bedrock of misery and is vigorously bumped
thereon for seven dkys.
They learn things early in the bush. At
Kentucky (N.S.W.), t’other day, a youngster of
twelve was bitten by a snake, whereupon a
brother, aged thirteen, scarified the wound,
applied the regulation ligature, then carried the
victim home, a mile away, for medical assistance.
Writer has seen a party of elderly city persons
suddenly and unanimously qualify for a lunatic
asylum on one of them being bitten by an ant.

“ C.X.Gr.” : A remarkable thing about
mules is their murderous propensities towards
foals. As sure as ever they get the foal away
from the mother they will kill it. A local stock-
owner in my district sold off his mules recently,
knowing that he got less than the market value
and he’s pretty keen on values. I asked him the
wherefore. He gave me the above information.
He had no separate paddock to keep his mules in,
and always found his foals dead if he left them
running with the mules. Had never seen the
mules on the job, but had no doubt by the tracks
as to the cause, the foals being literally kicked and
trampled to death.

“Eiddal”: Round the Cockydoodledo-
ville fringe in Victoria the lesson of the drought is
already forgotten. Not one cocky in 300 cut for
hay or to thresh this harvest; they relied solely
on Providence for an early grass, season. If we
have another drv year in 1900, stock stand as good
a show of being thinned off again as ever they
did. Cocky is a fitful, precarious animal when
times are good, and backs his luck more recklessly
than a two-up maniac.
In the substitution of “ mental hospitals ”
for “lunatic asylums” in its official reports
Maoriland sets a good example. The ferocious
term “madhouse” is now almost dead, and
“lunatic asylum” is under sentence. There is
more in such substitutions than a mere change of
words. In the madhouse days relatives preferred
any risk to sending, an afflicted person to a public
institution for treatment —-said treatment consist-
ing. mostly of chains, darkness, kicks and low diet.
Besides, the officials of a ferociously-named insti-
tution have a habit of acting up to the designation.
Words are influential.
Helen Davis, in. the New Idea, has been
interviewing the head of a Melbourne registry
office who was one of the first to open such a
place in Melbourne, and has been in business half
a century. Here is the gist: —
Takings up to £2O a day were common. Indeed I
thought this a poor day’s profit, when 500 emigrants were
arriving every fortnight. Whole families of children were
eagerly grabbed up for the stations. The youngsters
were of great use for keeping sheep in the boundaries of
unfenced runs. The wonderful variety of human beings
that passed in and out of the office became a fascinating
study. Emigrants were lodged in a Melbourne building
literally ship-shape, with berths and cabins. Men came
to pick wives. They would walk round as at Barnum’s
Show. Many wealthy squatters met their wives through
this office, and their names might surprise you.
There is nothing better for killing all
infectious disease germs than Little’s Soluble
Phenyle. Try it in your bath; use it generally
throughout the household if you want comfort. No
vermin can live where it is used ; has 100 different
uses. Ask your grocer for a bottle.*

THE PLAGES WE WOULD LIKE TO TRY.
[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
It’s good to hear the roaring mill
Wake, loud and clear, the echoing hill;
Day-long, night-long across the town
Its strenuous song comes rolling down.
It’s good to watch the swirling dirt
Sweep down the tables, and the spurt
Of broken water through the screen ;
The clotted lip-plate’s silver sheen —•
But out beneath the spreading sky
There’s places I should like to try.
Give me to see the beaten drill
All yellow, and to feel the thrill
Of waiting for the blast to rend
The thundering level, end to end ;
Then, through the smoky air, the gleam
Of torn gold in the shattered seam,
While, broadcast on the murky floor,
The guttering- candles flash on ore !
And out beneath the northern sky,
There places wait for us to try.
The thronging gully, and the swish
Of sieve and shaker, rattling dish,
And down the lead the ringing cry,
“Slug-oh! Slug-oh!” triumphant, high.
Snatched from its deep and rocky bed,
A hundred ounces, rough and red,
It shines to the revealing day
Through its dull vestiture of clay—
Wide-spread they dot the western plain—
The places we must try again.
It’s good to hear the roaring mill
Wake, loud and clear, the echoing hill;
But far from here old rushes hold
The secret pf their scattered gold—
It’s still to seek, the source of all
Those slugs beneath the Marble Wall,
And still the iron leaders wait
That shed their gold by Morning Gate.
They’ll call us, call us till we die—
The places we should like to try.

A WOMAN’S LETTER.
Sydney, January 16, 1906.
My Dear Arini, —
Prince Ferdinand of .Savoy is making royal con
volutions in acknowledgment of Sydney’s efforts
to entertain and overfeed him. He looks a nice,
unspoilt young man with a modest bearing and a
smile that journalese describes as W'inning. His
fair moustache and dark-brown eyes rather take
the fancy of the Unquiet Sex, and the cut of his
small-waisted, shape-filled sac coat has set the
fashion here for Italian male residents. He and
some of his gallant Calabrians motored out to
the A.N.A. Exhibition at the Agricultural
Ground on Saturday, and secretary M‘Guire
explained the meaning of A.N.A. to Ferdinand,
and showed him the home-grown hams and the
home-made maps, pianos, ironmongery and photo-
graphs. From these last the Prince had to be
torn away. They were Falk’s exhibit of some of
the prettiest women in this State, and made the
gazer pop-eyed. On Saturday evening the
Savoyard and certain officers had a box at Her
Majesty’s, but before they entered it the Prince
and manager Goodman engaged in a spine-bending
contest. Then the Somebodies sat down in time
to hear Florence Young assert that “love was
delightful, but marriage was the death of love.”
The Calabrians speak English so well, too ! There
was no hope of them not understanding. How-
ever, they’ve got the terrible D’Annunzio in their
own country, and it’s just what he would have
said—only in earnest.
In the box with the man-o’-warsmen was Dr.
Marano, the Italian Consul. When a prince of
his country comes here, the Consul looks as if he’d
invented royalty. Madame Marano is an Aus-
tralian, and the black-haired Ariostos and Fillippis
must have admired her hair, which is red gold
and abundant. The prince is a total abstainer,
and yesterday, at Mayor Allen Taylor’s banquet
to him, he got confused, rose at the toast of his
own health, and drank to himself in water.
“We didn’t know it was loaded—with that
kind of ammunition ” was the wail of one of the
nine members of Parliament who tried to “pay a
call” on friends staying at the Australia last
Sunday. Three minions guarded the entrance to
the hotel, and they must have felt like mewing
with joy when they told the tuneful nine men
who helped to pass the Act—“ The new Act
forbids it, sir; the management would be liable
to a fine of ten pounds for each person, sir,
not a boney-fidey traveller, lodger, servant, or
other inmate of this hotel. O, you are a boney-
fidjy traveller, sir. Well, where’s your luggage?
No, that little brief bag ivon’t do. You must pro-
duce Saratogas, suit cases, hat boxes, portman-
teaux, fishing-rods, guns and rugs.” Aside to
fellow-minion: “Keep your eye on the red-faced
legislator, Billy; he means to break in on your
left.”
Up came the chief clerk in a big Government
department. He was escorting a near lady relative
of his back from church. “You will stay to
lunch ?” said the lady, and he replied that he had
that intention. He got as far as the dining-room
with his relative, then he was most firmly and
courteously “fired” by the management and its
minions.
But it was Mr. H. A. Parsons, an Adelaide
barrister, who played heavy lead in the pleasant
Sunday morning comedy at the Australia. He
“has the honor to be Japanese Consul at Ade-
laide.” A few hours after his arrival here Mr.
Iwasaki called on him, and was left smiling in-
scrutably on the rubber mat while a porter went
up and told the flabbergasted Adelaidean that
Sunday “ at homes ” at the hotel were “ off,” and
if he wished to see his colleague he would have to
do it under the concave vault of heaven. Both
Consuls then retired to the Botanic Gardens, and
were talking Imperial reciprocity, when a police-
man came up and told them that “they mustn't
smoke in the Gardens. ” After that Mr. Parsons
slipped back to his hotel and wrote a letter to the
Daily Telegraph that nearly blew the roof off
the establishment.
Actresses who stay at frilly hotels are making
outcry against the new Thou Shalt Not clause.
No longer may the wine king, the mining mag-
nate, or the young man with much money and few
brains treat them to supper after the play. If he
bids them drink and be merry after 11 p.m., he’ll
have to stop at the same hotel.
As most barmaids are over 21, not many have
had to quit for the under-age reason. Isn’t it
strange : This kind and careful Government rules
that a woman must be 21 before she is a barmaid.
Yet a woman is eligible for what has been
described as “the oldest profession on earth”
at the age of 17 !
Reported that Sydney Ferries, Limited, has
bought Clifton Gardens, yclept Chowder in ye
olden tyme. Also said that the energetic mono-
poly intends to make a new suburb there which
will rival Mosman and bring more grist to the
usual half-yearly dividend of the co. That’s in
the future, and on the knees of the gods. Mean-
while the co. has started the Clifton Continentals.
Steamers will run to the gardens on moonlit
nights, and good musical programmes will
be rendered in the open air. When the actors
are resting the band will take up the running, and
the people will promenade by twos up and down
the grassy sward and along the little sandy beach
where the wavelets lap, and drink tea and
soft liquors in the tiny bush-houses. The
first of the Continentals was given on Wednes-
day evening last, but a frightful dust storm
followed by rain, spoilt it. A crowd of honest
folk gathered and listened to a good programme
which included selections from Verdi. Accom-
panist J. Edward Sykes gave the show a great
deal of dignity and rattling good music. Clifton
is a delightful place ; the vast rampart of hill that
surrounds it on the land side keeps away all winds
excepting those that come from the south, and in
all the world it would be hard to find a better
place for open-air entertainments. Many people
live in hopes of seeing the German bier-garten
acclimatised in Australia, but the .Austral tem-
perament will have to change first. A German
bier-garten translated to Australia would become
a bear-garden. There would be more riots at it in
one week than through a decade in the Vaterland.
But a place where a man can sip tea with his best
girl and gaze on the moonlit water while a band
plays “I gave my life for thee” is the place
Sydney has been seeking for a long while.
Again—for the manyth time—the husband is a
marine product. Someone sends me from Colombo
a paper with an account of the wedding of Mr.
Walter Shakspeare and Miss Jean Barnes, that
occurred on the fourth of last month. Bride is a
squatter-girl from Casino, Richmond River dis-
trict, one of a group of unusually pretty sisters.
A sister of hers was married, a little time ago, to
a. son of Mr. Weigall, master of the Sydney
Grammar School, and went to live in some tropical
region where the finest orchids grow in your back
yard without being asked. Mr. Shakspeare is a
planter, with various other laudable and money-
making annexes to his business. Miss Barnes
and he met on a voyage to England. They gob
more than a thousand wedding presents, including
a bushel of cheques, and the bride’s dress is
described as having been three months in creation.
Early death from pneumonia of the beautiful
Lilian Wheeler in the United States, fulfils in a way
one of her prophecies about herself. She used to tell
her intimate friends that she would die whilst still
young and die tragically. She was a Castlemaine
(Vic.) girl, the daughter of a somewhat eccentric
and brilliant mother who, after her husband’s
death, continued to run the paper of which
he had been proprietor. First time I met
Lilian Wheeler was in Melbourne at one
of Dr. Neild’s literary evening receptions,
and her beauty of face, figure and carriage
seemed to me to be without flaw. She and another
girl (now Mrs. W. Baumann) were resident
students at the house of one Andrews, an accom-
plished University coach, whose wife also carried
many cargoes of learning and later took to lectur-
ing on the superiority of men to women. The
two girl pupils used to rush round considerably in
a smart little dogcart which belonged to one of
them. Both had some money, and Miss Wheeler
was parentless. Both ardently . desired “to do
something.” Miss Wheeler consulted Dr. Neild
about going on the stage. He sent her portrait to
George Rignold, who was, with his company, play-
ing at Adelaide. I remember that portrait well.
It showed to advantage her proud head with its long
columnar neck, and the broad sloping shoulders,
the decolletege outlined by a great ostrich feather
boa. Rignold’s reply was wired, and was a
request to send the original. She proved a gifted
actress, and Australia remembers with admiration
her Desdemona. She married a year or so ago, in
London, an actor named Mainwaring, son of a
general.
Melba seems to be, like chess or music, never
fully accomplished. Aninterviewer now mentions
that she takes twos in shoes. She carries herself
very gracefully then on such inadequate supports.
Large women with abnormally small feet don’t
often walk well. In this, the latest official chat,
Melba says nothing of her coming to Australia.
She says she did intend to go to Monterey, but
had finally resolved to spend some winter months
at Malta and Cairo. She was to be at Malta this
month.
Miss Nance O’Neil, interviewed (in a pink
kimona) at San Francisco, says nice things of
Australia and “sends You-You for the inevitable
M‘Kee Rankin.” You-You is a tiny Japanese
maid. The artiste had recently got her in San
Fran. If she were born over again Miss O’Neil
would like to be born a South Sea Islander. “I
do like the life down there in the South Seas. I
like especially Maggie, the Maori guide, who took
me to Rotorua. Such a wonderful place. If there
were any such place in America we would make
much more of it.” Then she showed Maggie’s
portrait in “ Rough Rider outfit.” But is Maori-
land a South Sea Island ? And how does Maggie
like being called a S.S. Islander—Maggie w r ho
talks proudly of “ Maoridom,” and the destiny of
her race, and other things, as if she were a Jew
with an eye still on Jerusalem and a resolve to
build up Solomon’s temple once more ?
A big snapshot entitled “ Miss Marie Corelli
smiles ” appears in an English illustrated weekly.
The writer has just stepped from her carriage and
holds her skirts up with one hand. The other
hand and arm are out like a fin. Her eyes are
closed, her mouth open, and altogether she looks
like a Black Maria traveller who has just alighted
for the purpose of doing fourteen days for spirits,
language, and the rending of a policeman’s gar-
ments. No snapshotter ever yet caught a subject
in graceful movement. Snapshots of men walking
look like bad cases of locomotor ataxia ; snapshots
of women in movement remind one of strange sea
monsters hurrying on their tails.
The titled and ornamental widow of the Darley
family, who recently married Hanbury-Tracy, of
the Guards, showed her good sense by being
married in a travelling dress of grey cloth. A
few years ago a widow in another State than
this got married to No. 2, dressed in virginal trap-
pings of white and orange blooms, snowy posy,
pearls and an Alexandra curl. And when the
press announcement of the marriage appeared she
was “ Gwendoline, the daughter of So and So.”
No mention of the first husband. An aunt of the
bride —a lady with a face like the Athanasian
creed—upbraided her for her affectation and
trickery. “Be quiet,” commanded the bride, “ I
never looked upon my first marriage as anything
but a rehearsal.”
A few years ago a Yankee millionaire mar-
ried a small belle of Japan, took her to
his country, where she wore the dress of her
country, and N. Y. society used to rush
the Opera House to see her. Then the
pair returned to Japan and lived in a
bamboo palace, and had a daughter of the
Samurai to visit them. She all but broke up
the happy home, with its mats and little pipes,
and long-tailed roosters fighting on the black satin
screens. The hundred-year-old oak growing in a
pot as big as a cup, and the toy spaniel, and the
view of Fujiyama no longer brought joy to Mrs.
Plum-blossom, and she turned the other lady out of

All Sydney is sorry for the Ernest Milfords
(Lambton, Milford and Abbott), whose only son,
a youth of 18, died last week after an operation
for appendicitis.
“Sister Pattie,” selected by Parson Fitchett in
his rambles in England for missionary service in
Sydney, speaks better for his taste than do the
articles he picks for his magazine. She is a
pleasant woman, with outward signs of a big
heart. She has rnissionised in Manchester for
many years.
Dr. Stretch, Dean of Newcastle, leads in the
running for the late Bishop Stanton’s episcopal
shoes. Dr. Stretch has been coadjutor Bishop of
Brisbane, and, though handicapped by an eye-
trouble, is a man of restless energy. They used,
to take him for a circus, solely by reason of his
velocity, when doing mission work on Queensland
stations.
Two new private motor cars are purring (their
voice is a kind of giant purr) about Sydney—Mr.
Owen Cox’s Darracq, “ appointed,” as motor
books say, in royal crimson, and Mr. Ramaciotti’s
de Dion, a dark blue car with white lines. De
Dion, a noted French duellist, was (a friendly
lightning conductor—the right trade name for the
chauffeur—tells me) the in ventor of the big clock-
work carriage, and got his inspiration while
looking into a Parisian toy-shop at a clockwork
toy coach. Almost at the same time Serpolet,
now Mr. Frank Gardner’s partner, the engineer
then at the head of the Paris municipality, was
perfecting his plans for a steam car—the Gard-
ner-Serpolet.
The majority of the naval officers who are in-
festing Sydney and Hobart are bald. The blue-
jackets are all well-haired. Officers have to wear
their caps, I’m told, at all times on deck. At the
sight of a capless officer the very cannon would
melt. Another proof that the covered head is
presently the bald head. By the way, does any-
one know a bald butcher ? If not, another proof
of the value of grease. I pass a flesh shop fre-
quently, and see one of the men carrying fat
carcases from cart to shop on his head. He has
mats of hair. If he let it grow he might be polled
twice a year like Absolom, the sale of whose hair
brought him in a good income. By the way did
Absolom sell his hair?
Archbishop Saumarez Smith and a group of
Smithereens left by Saturday’s liner. S.S., who
is himself over 70, goes back to Smithfield, or
some place adjacent thereunto, on family business,
to help wind up the affairs of his recent] y-
deceased father. Went also Mrs. Lvster, wife of
the Victoria Barracks Colonel, and her friend, a
Mrs. Hill (widow of the youngest son of the Earl
of Scarborough), a lady who compounds and uses
a skin food that keeps her face at least in rose-leaf
condition.
Mr. Crick, of Lands Inquiry fame, left by the
Sonoma on Saturday for Maoriland.
Ex-Australian artist Condor’s house has been
burgled to a moderate extent, and they’ve caught
the burglar. Condor married a rich woman who
owned some unique furniture. Their residence in
Chelsea (England) is one of the show places of
that locality.
Grace Palotta has gone to Vienna to secure a
stage wardrobe for our benefit. She and Hugh
Ward come to play under Mr. Edwin Geach’s
management.
An interesting study in small vices is the study
of the lie feminine. A man who has a varied ex-
perience of boarding houses tells me that it is
difficult to find a landlady who has not, some
years earlier, kept a carriage, and done
European travel. She still has distinguished
relations, but now that she has to work they
ignore her. The more battered and exhausted
with battling is the lady the taller is the story.
The favorite fib of the unmarried She is her
(alleged) refusal of the (mythical) offer of marri-
age. There is in the Senate of this Commonwealth
a Senator, young, alleged to be talented, and
probably not plainer than most men. I don’t
know the gentleman at all, but I’m beginning to
feel quite sorry for him because he woos so vainly.
Met the fourth girl lately who had refused
to marry him. All four were working women.
They didn’t go out charing, you know, and they
werh educated'. But their early youth was a thing
of some years ago, and, more than all else, they
were getting their own living. Yet they wouldn’t
marry the Senator. They simply couldn’t. Al-
though they had no doubt of his love for them,
they couldn’t return it. “I dare say I’m very
silly and old-fashioned to be so high-minded,”
said one of the rejectors, “ but I would not deceive
him. I said, ‘ Are you willing to take me unlov-
ing, and trust to my learning to love you by-and-
bye?’ And he answered, ‘No, Sargominda, I
am not.’ Soweparted.” Just so. Like a man
and a maid in a novel. Perhaps it is dramatic
instinct as well as an obscure form of vanity that
prompts the telling of such tales.
The sky-scraper hat has overrun Paris like a
cavalry charge. The hair of the wearer is first
done as high as possible. Then, by means of a
big “ lift ” at the back, the hat, which is already
a very long-bodied one, is tilted up vertically
above the wearer’s eyes. High above all a bunch
of plumes soars into the welkin and catches in the
feet of the gilt rooster on the church steeple.
Periodical influenza has this year struck Sydney
in a gastric form. In London it was gastric last
year, but this year it is neuralgic, the chief symp-
toms being severe nerve pains. An English
specialist has been saying:—
I believe we are in for a repetition of the headaches
and neuralgias of the Ws. These also followed the out-
break of influenza of 1849-50. So far as I have been able
to retrace it, the disease pursued the same cycle, and
finished with an epidemic of neuralgia and headaches.
It was in the ’6o’s that every woman carried a vinaigrette
and smelling salts owing to universal and “ fashionable ”
headaches ; and something of the same sort may be ex-
pected for a year or two in the future. Quinine is the
most effective remedy for the attack.
English residents in India make appeal through
“ the columns of your valuable journal ” to new
"V iceroy Minto to allow them to forego some of

Bouquets cost £5 each, which is a healthy item to
begin with. “Unless I wish to ‘eat shame,’as
the natives have it,” wails one writer, “ I shall

few flowers for the three ladies I have to take to
the drawing-room.”

One of the M.L. postcards bears a portrait, in
color-printing, of the great Maori chief and
warrior, Te Heuheu, of Lake Taupo. It was he :

pehu to the M.L. Government as a National Park.
He was a noble-looking old savage, and died in
1888.
The worship of King Poodle in London, I’m
told by a, correspondent, grows simply revolting.
It is quite the fashion with women to send
His Majesty the Dog out for an airing in the
family carriage. When he goes out this way he
has to be nursed by his maid, and the footman has
to get down and let him out for a run and a tail
wag, and to be particularly careful not to let him
mix with nasty plebeian dogs. If the family coach
is in use, or in pawn, King Poodle is sent out for
a ride in a'perambulator, and the nursemaid has
strict injunctions not to let the sun freckle his
pretty face, or to let a drop of rain touch his sweet
skin. My correspondent has seen a carriage stop
in order that King Poodle should be carefully
handed out by his mistress to a blushing footman
for a minute or two, and the manner in which
his Majesty was fondled when he returned to
his cushioned ease - indicated how terrible the
pangs of parting had been.
Amongst those with whom the Wales highnesses
“conversed affably” during their Indian tour was

Mdlle. Rubinstein, of Yalaze fame, who
returned to Melbourne recently from a trip to
Europe is on her way to New Zealand and she
will break hfer journey at Sydney for a week or so
in order to give the ladies of this city and vicinity
an opportunity of interviewing her. She may be
consulted at Washington H. Soul’s, daily from the
22nd. She has with her many new and wonderful
beauty preparations secured in Europe. Her
visit to the Old World convinced her, after care-
ful and indefatigable inquiry, that Valaze stands
supreme and alone as a skin-food, a conclusion
gratifying to herself and to her ever-increasing
Australian clientele. Among the new prepara-
tions are—a marvellous “Blackhead and Open
Pore Cure,” guaranteed to cure the most obstinate
cases (2s. 6d.); a “Creme Promenade” for use
before personal appearance at concerts, outdoor
entertainments &c., (3s. 6d.); a delightful prepara-
tion “ Voskpasta ” (35.) to be used in conjunction
with Yalaze Herbal Complexion Soap (25.);
Yalaze Massage Rollers, for use in the home, &c.
Yalaze Herbal Skin-food is the most exquisite
preparation for removing wrinkles, freckles, tan
and facial disfigurements (3s. 6d. and 6s. posted
6d. extra). Sydney ladies are invited to make a
point of seeing Mdlle. Rubinstein during her visit
to Sydney. Washington H. Soul and Civil
Service, Sydney, stock all Valaze preparations,
which may also be had from the leading chemists
in all States, or Mdlle. H. Rubinstein and Co.,

It is generally thought that there is no
cure for stoutness, because the usual treatments
only confine themselves to combating single
symptoms instead of attacking the root of the
disease. Pyrolene Pellets remove not only the
superfluous fat, but also the internal deposits of
fat which hinder the action of the heart and lungs.
We advise a trial. Pyrolene Pellets improve the
breathing, give the heart freedom, and enable the

MELBOURNE CHATTER.
Melbourne, January 16, 1906.
Mt Dear Yarrie,—
Annette Kellermann’s success as a marine acrobat
has put notions into the heads of hundreds of sea-
side dwellers. From Brighton where Annette’s
first public revels in the blue took place, right
along the beach-line to Mentone and Mordialloc,
young women are practising in the briny deep.
One of the seven children of a lady moans that her
Mommer has got new notions through the
Kellermann example. She bought herself a giddy
scarlet French stockingette gown which clings
close to the figure, and she does the showy double-
trudgeon stroke to the bath fence and, arrived
there, perches herself up jauntily like a little
robin redbreast in the sun, while the family, in
plain brown gowns, capacious enough to hang
loose over a George Reid, have to sport un-
obtrusively.
But sometimes the mother has her yarn to tell
in complaint of the rising generation. It seems
the loves of the family start at a preposterously
early age. Her children break out into flirtations
at seven and eight, and develop into winning
sirens before they are long into their teens. They
cover advanced novels in linen or brown paper,
marking them “ History of England ” or “ Alge-
bra,” and pen warm letters of affection when
they should be at their home arithmetic.
They pinch in their waists from the first
day they wear a straight-front, and em-
phasise every small curve of the form. They
have set opinions at 13, and a whole philosophy of
life before they are out of school pinnies. They
attend the M.C.C. moonlight concerts, sit out the
programme where the music won’t interrupt, and
dab their noses with powder between attentions
from little Algernon. The she-parent of such a
family feels helpless. The kids say, “Mother,
don’t be a silly. We're all right.” And they pro-
bably are. But the exact meaning of “ all right ”
is not easily defined.
A steamy mass of people jammed itself into the
Bostock Circus tent, the other night, to see an
advertised Lottie flaunt her millinery in a den of
lions. When this turn arrived, after nearly three
hot hours of clever variety show, the intrepid
female was apologised for. The audience uttered
a perspiring groan. The Master of Ceremonies
thereupon called upon any strange She in the
congregation to enter the cage where the odor of
animal came from. None responded, but subse-
quently one was evolved from the properties, or
the neighboring Chute. She was a mere scrap of
agirleen, such an unconsidered trifle, such a hollow
mockery of a lion’s toothful, that, the raging beasties
drew off into a corner and snarled their contempt.
The Tamer and the girleen took several turns fore
and aft the cage and earned the approval of the
crowd. It occurred to me that if the large fleshy
She, who had shown her ample curves in rose-pink
tights at an earlier turn in the bill, had only ven-
tured into the presence of the lions, the steaming
audience might have seen some tragedy for its
money. A large juicy bait of that kind might
have provoked the beasties to anticipate their
next feeding time.
A dame, who is regarded as a model of propriety
and a whole volume of etiquette, visited a moun-
tainous resort at the New Year and rallied her
swagger pals round the Bridge board. They
didn’t need much encouragement. The dame won
steadily, and when she had made her hotel exes
for a few weeks she retired beamingly, like the
Duchess in “The Walls of Jericho.” And now
the sojourners of the hills are calling her a cat.
By the way, rumor has it that two infuriated
husbands who hate cards, and take; more interest
(ordinarily) in affairs of State than in the doings
of the whole feminine sex outside their own
households, are growing, gray and bald trying to
keep pace with their wives at Bridge-play. They
do it perhaps to keep the idle bachelor and
vacillating spouse off the mat, but they haven’t
yet exhausted the patience of their dames.
It is impossible to exhaust the public stock of
Dame Northcote’s patience or affability. On the
Sabbath morn, when the battalions of ’Arries and
’Arriets are on their way to the picnic stations,
the Exes, are generally driving to the Cathedral,
and it is ’Arry’s notion of brave mockery to doff
his decker airily, and always the dame nods and
spends a wreathed smile on the awkward salute.
Housekeepers are in the running just now. An
important Government officer, the other day,
married his cottage janitress; and away in the
Western State there’s a great cry about another
important professional who has done likewise.
“So if you’re looking for a husband,” as the pre-
sent Rickards tune goes, don’t forget to give a call
at the registry office, where other lonely gentle-
men may be requiring someone to darn their socks
with a view to matrimony.
The Pursey Chirnsides are clanging all the cow-
bells of the Werribee run, for unto them another
son has been born. It is highly creditable to the
beauty-dame that, while all her wool chums are
frisking over the festive quarters of the globe, she
remains at home and gives her patriotic attention
to home, country and the birth-rate.
The Mount Lyell (Tas.) Stichts had put the
family cradle in the lumber room or the wood shed,
and there it had rested for 10 years. Now it is
suddenly Called into service again. It’s a boy.
The Stichts are about the most popular Yanks
residing in the Commonwealth.
Dapper little Commander Collins of the Navy
department must have been through the mangle
while reconnoitring naval and social quarters in
the Cold Country. He ■is a shadow of his former
self, and that was quite a meagre little self. Also
he is grey, and less pink in the cheek. If it
weren’t for the little bantam strut, the socks and
the ties, none of his old she-chums would recog-
nise him.
Photographers mourn the fate of the ivory
miniature. This dainty gewgaw was a lucrative
item to them, but the cheap snapshot in a
Brummy frame killed the fashion, which was
dropped as soon as Suzette started to dangle Bill
or Bob in a gilt circle round her neck.
Melbourne is about to own a new college for
the training of Anglican parsons. The Warden
is to be Canon Reginald Stephen, once sub-
warden of Trinity College, Melbourne Univer-
sity. Stephen is an Australian, and was lauded
for his scholarship by the Argus in one of its
recent parson-praising articles. He is known in
Bananaland as well as in Victoria. The priest-
factory, to be called St. John’s College, takes over
the buildings and grounds of the private school,
Cumloden, which for years regarded itself as
quite the “naicest” of Victorian boys’ schools.
Cumloden, carried on with great success by
Martin Burn, was born of a row in the Church of
England Grammar School, but the angel of peace
has spread its wings, and the. “Melbourne
Grammar” has the Cumloden boys in its bosom
again.
A young artist, who recently carried off the
travelling scholarship in connection with Mel-
bourne’s National School of Art, has been some-
what staggered by a suggestion from his models
that the hit of his life was practically achieved
through them. “ A consensus of opinion,” wrote
one, “among ourselves and friends is that our
efforts have contributed so materially to your
success that we deserve a handsome honorarium
at your hands. This,” concludes the writer sug-
gestively, “ we must of course leave to your sense
of what is gentlemanly and considerate.” The
artist is now awaiting the oil-and-color man’s
claim to special recognition.
If the lady in question sees this she’ll under-
stand—if she isn’t aware of it already—that she is
one woman in a thousand. She stepped out of a
scarlet-tinted motor-car in Bourke-street the other
afternoon, and, as she crossed the street, all
beholders stopped to look. She was tall and
dark, and she had glorious eyes; she was all in
white, save for the scarlet gossamer motor-veil,
and she walked with the grace of Juno. Grace-
fully lounging into Cole’s book-shop, she asked,
not for the “ Droppings-in of Gwendoline ” or the
“Happenings of Elizabeth,” but for Heine,
Hazlitt, Emerson, and Schopenhauer. She was
Balzac’s dame d trente ans —and she was worthy of
her literary creator.
Mrs. J. Traill, of the Sumner clan, mounted the
Himalaya gangway last week for the backward
trip to her captain spouse. The family turned
out in full force to see its sprightliest member off,
and Aide Stephens, who voyaged by the liner,
was given a hint to turn a neighborly eye upon
the lone one and hand along the smelling salts
whenever the high seas raged.
Miss Beatrice Madden, the plumpest and
youngest hope of the Chief Justice, now gets
her first jaunt abroad with Pa. The jolly young
Beatrice hasn’t finished schooling yet, but
will round off her studies at sea and in the places
appointed on the careful chart arranged by Papa.
It seems a serious thing for a man to take a
daughter of Eve on a political campaign by way
of cheering the way and giving counsel in matters
where the masculine intellect might fall short of
subtlety. In a certain State a political candidate
had a she-chum to inspire him on the platform
way. The electors didn’t approve, and made
their displeasure manifest by voting for the man
who did not travel with a platonic friendship.
J. C. Williamson still rakes in the shining
amateur. Miss Irene Dillon is the latest. For
years she has been twirling a peculiarly flexible
toe for the public that supports amateur shows.
J.C.W.’s emissaries were out on the watch. She
is now booked with the Royal Comic Opera Co.
She is a daughter of the late dentist Dillon, of
Collins-street. The theatrical ambition is in-
herited from a Mama who had a trial of the stage
in the lung ago, and has sympathies that way
now.
The Trawalla Simpsons broke out into belated
Christmas tree revels the mother day. Miss Simp-
son had the maple tree sprouting gifts for young
and old. A high time was spent in the heat of
January 6th at the Toorak mansion doing honor
to the departed goose festival.
Beauty-expert Helena Rubenstein trips to Syd-
ney this week. The pretty Viennese has the
wonders of her new massage treatment to spread

Alas for the poor horse ! Pony skin is adver-
tised as the best material for a motor defence uni-
form. So the horse gives up both the road and his
hide to the conquering and smelly rival.
Melba was naive for once. She told an Aus-
tralian interviewer that her topmost ambition,
speaking impersonally (as if the interviewer could
be impersonal), was a collection of great paintings.
“ In the more familiar sense,” quoth the lady,
“ I like to dream of doing something for those less
fortunate than myself.”
The servants of Melba own characteristics,
according to a touring scribe, peculiar to a Court
where intrigues are rampant. “ Their speech
and expression are non-committal, their bearing
immutable.”
The Chosen tribes are getting engaged busily.
They beat the Christians at summer troth-
plighting. Paunch last week issued a balance-
sheet, or rather column, of engagements of the
Chosen exclusively. Not one fresh Christian
couple was reported as bringing its spooning by
the sad seashore to a head.
They talk in Paris of a henna tea wash for the
hair, and a long sun-drying. Top of all a violent
fit of brushing, after which the thatch is said to
actually glow and glisten dazzlingly to the eye.
It sounds all right, but think of the awful results
arrived at in the past through experiments with
hair of dull hue ! Eyes have been injured, and the
thatch has sometimes been lost irretrievably.
Bundles of the new-colored tresses havdjfallen out
without provocation, and great bare patches have
been sacred to the memory thenceforth. Better
one’s own mouse-color and a dab of brilliantine to
relieve matters than to seek a bronze glow or copper
gleam at the risk of Fortune giving you a bare
cranium that looks like the skull of your grand-
father 10 times removed.
Mr. Alberto Zelman and Miss Maud Harring-
ton are booked, not as an engaged couple merely,
but as individual instructors of strum and song at
the ’Varsity Conservatorium. The appointments
have their droll elements. The she-students will not
be violently interested in an instructor whose best
girl is training the top O in the. way it should sky-
lark in the next room. A sentimental interest is
so valuable in musical matters, and even a gay
seasoned Benedict is whole circuses better than a
very proper engaged young male. Miss Harring-
ton is a Marshall Hall star pupil, and she has had
a small dose of pantomime experience.
Three Toorak charmers fell out (and hurt them-
selves badly) over one young official with a pink
bloom in his English cheeks. The said youth
philandered recklessly with the trio, but when it
came to playing for keeps, a chubby little dazzler
(owning a brilliant sister in London) was the
winner. The two discarded darlings therewith
grew piqued, and a three-cornered feminine row
followed.
One of the Jackson Eamily girls had better
pause and consider what she means to do. A
leading Big Smoke magazine drew attention to
the fact that some Miss Anderson made a sensa-
tional debut at Queen’s Hall as a flautist. Long
personal data followed, and it was given out that
the sweet piper vows never to kiss ‘ ‘ because kissing
ruins that delicate sensitiveness of the lips which
is the chief quality of the flautist.” Is the game
worth the candle ? Eancy a musical, good-
looking She going through life unkissed except on
the ear ?
The absence of Miss Celia Ghiloni from “ The
Sorcerer ” show on Saturday night was a disap-
pointment to the local playgoer. None had
guessed what a large, cheery factor the plump
Celia was in the company till she stayed away.
The Suburban Misses who thought themselves
great shakes in their cotton kimonas have been
gazing in wonderment on the superb clothing of
the genuine Japs in the recent circus. Nothing
more scrumptious in the way of apparel has
been seen in this State. An elephant’s official
trappings weren’t a circumstance to the seven sets
of kimonas trotted out by this Jap team.
Aide G. Byng Stephens took farewell of a few
Toorakites last week, preparatory to scaling the
gangway of the Himalaya. He goes hence for
half a year, and half of Toorak has lost a meek
and cheerful chum for that time. There are, by
the way, the makings of a diplomat in Aide
Greville, the small, well-tubbed, fresh-eyed
Northcote help. He beats all his careful brethren
at management. When in doubt he lifts his lid
at a person. Even when he’s not in doubt he 11
lift it. And it delights the groveller to get this
semi-V.R. recognition.
The story goes that a capitalist has incurred the
hearty disgust of acquaintances by trading on
their common weakness. They are a gouty and
rheumaticky crowd for the most part, and they
lent a willing ear to the rich one when he
told them tales of a new and mysterious gout cure.
The specific was worth £2O a pint, or thereabouts
—he told them. But as a favor he would sell
them a small bottle, enough to cure them, at the
rate of, say, £2 a pint. The charm of the nostrum
was in the mystery of its origin, and the vendor
disposed of any number of small doses. The
lucrative business ended in the discovery that the
philanthropic retailer had been re-bottling an
ordinary patent medicine at a huge profit.
Yours Affectionately,
TRYPHENA.
This paper has just received a bulky
scientific publication from the United States
addressed “Sidney Bulletin, Esq., Geraldton,
Johnstone River, North Queensland, Australia.”
This effort of misdirection almost amounts to
genius.
Captain Forbes, who used to command
the Edina, a Howard Smith steamer that pottered
about Port Phillip, has struck England with a
new invention, which records automatically not
only the distance that a steamer has travelled, but
the direction in which it has gone. The British
Admiralty has tried the invention with much
more than its usual haste, and has found it good.
Consequently another Australian promises to
leave a big footmark in history, for a device which
will enable a ship to know its exact position in
darkness or fog is little less than a revolution in
the science which guides those who go groping
over the waste of waters in ships. As for the
submarine, the new invention puts it on a new
footing, and gives it eyes, whereas it was formerly
blind.
“ Hamer ” : The South Coast (N.S.W.) is
at present swarming with two varieties of couples,
one with a transparent affectation of not being
newly married, and the other with a sus-
picious affectation of being newly married. I
volunteered, the other day, to carry a message for
a lady who was searching for her cavalier in the
down stairs region of a South Coast hotel, and
found him lurking in an out-of-the-way corner of
the verandah, anxiously watching the arrival of
the passengers by the Sydney train. “Mr.
dßlank,” I said, “ vour wife’s dow i tairs looking
for you.” Then Blank made a r . Ii through a
window, took the cloth and various pieces of
crockery with him in his flight through the coffee-
room, and went down the fire-escape stairs in
three strides. I returned to the lady and informed
her that she would find her husband fleeing to-
wards the Blowhole.
An examination of the Victorian criminal
records dealing with pickpockets reveals the
curious fact that 80 per cent, of those convicted of
pocket-picking are hair-dressers by occupation.
Fifteen per cent, claim to be turf commission
agents, and the other five per cent, are of various
occupations. It would seem that the agility of
the fingers gained by constant use of the scissors
is a peculiarly good training for pocket-emptying,
while the practice of skimming a man’s face with
the keen edge of a razor without mutilating him
—much —inculcates that care which enables the
expert “hook” to go through a pocket without
exciting the patient. The turf commission agent
turns to picking pockets quite naturally, the gap
between the two professions being so narrow.
W. J. Spruson writes re the late Victor
Daley’s alleged disapproval of the picture which
Norman Lindsay drew for his Christmas verses,
“A Vision of Calvary ”
I am on a good wicket, as you say, because, notwith-
standing your delicately expressed doubts as to my
veracity, it happens that the story is corroborated by
two others—Mr. Rod. Quinn and Mr. P. Packham—who
were present, and heard Daley’s comments. I shall not
further annoy you by repeating just what Daley did say.
It is enough that he disapproved of Lindsay’s picture
with much emphasis, not in his dying moments, but
immediately he saw the picture, nearly a fortnight before
his death, whilst his mind was still bright. Your doubts
about the occurrence of a “ mental change ” —which I
presume refers to his receiving the last sacraments—are
as well founded as the others concerning the much
discussed picture.
Regarding which The Bulletin merely desires to
say th it it has no fresh remarks to make about
Mr, S pruson’s veracity or any other aspect of the
case.
Although Adelaide has had four Anglican
Bishops, not one of them has died or been buried
in S. A. They all left in good time for some place
where there was a larger fleshpot. On the other
hand, out of five Catholic Archbishops or Bishops,
three have found their last resting place within
the limits of the diocese. Now the first Catholic
Bishop of Port Augusta (the northern part of the
State) has died and been interred in the see.
The Shire Council of the long-settled
district of Maldon (Vic.), where the most pros-
perous daii'y farmers grow, is by way of ex-
posing its "awful incompetence—or worse—to
the public gaze. A State auditor has been
going through its books, and his disclosures are
surprising. He discovered that arrears of uncol-
lected rates date from 1873, no less ; that arrears
on numerous properties were written off without
any authority ; that one council chairman signed
for £306 of arrears in one lump as being written
off, though he had no earthly authority to do so ;
that other arrears were remitted by a council
committee entirely without authority; and that
as there are about £2OOO of arrears due, of which
about half are still recoverable, a special audit
should be made, and the council ordered to wade
in and collect. Which is a very proper recommen-
dation ; but as many of those defaulting rate-
payers are either councillors themselves or more
or less related to councillors the proposal is likely
to come to very little. Take them all round these
Maldon cow-punchers would seem to be fit mates
for the swindling Rodney farmers, who shuffled
out of their irrigation dues and shunted the debt
on to the shoulders of the public generally, and of
posterity.

brown bishop and brown clergymen for Papua.
Yet what is a brown land doing with a white
bishop?

Mr. Middleton, post and telegraph master
at Goulburn (N.S.W.), is about to retire from the
service after 44| years’ work. He was in the head
office at Sydney when the work of the telegraph
department was conducted by four operators.
The latest Victorian bank clerk to be
charged with embezzlement is a 50-year-old
bachelor, therefore the defence is awaited with
cynical interest. Devoid of wife and family, and
cut off from the plea of youthful temptation, the
accused will have to create some new extenuating
circumstances if he is to melt the judge to tears.
The last time a Vic. judge wept it was on account
of an elderly married public servant whose salary
had been so substantial that he was lured into
unfortunate investments, and naturally went
astray. A heart-rending case.

The death of Mrs. Sophia West Hallen at
the age of close on 90 years revives memories of
, , „ r . ir T , -d, , ,
her father, William Lawson, who, with Blaxland
and Wentworth, crossed the Blue Mountains in
1813. Lawson was a curious blend of soldier,
sailor, explorer, sheep-breeder, and civil magis-
trate ; and, above all, he possessed the knack of
accumulating property. The statue in the niche
at Sydney Lands Office is said to resemble him on
his way to Government House for an additional
free grant of territory. Mrs. Hallen’s husband
was an architect and surveyor, also a brisk accu-
mulator of property. Sydney Grammar School is
one of his architectural designs.
‘•Democritus”: That fine verse-writer,
Grant Hervey, has written many hard things
about Jews. Hebrews, Yids, three-ball men, Ikeys
and the like. But when he was charged with
shooting at Baker, the Gentile, we find this
curious result:—
First day at the Police Court: Mr. Wolf Marks appeared
for defendant.
Second day : Mr. Wolf Marks, representing the office of
f °r r u ef ? ndant i , , , ,
Third day : Mr. John Isaacs for defendant.
Finally, Mr,. Maxwell appeared for defendant;
and, if Maxwell’s nose means anything, there was
a shipload of Hebrews wrecked on the wild Scotch
coast some time in the Middle Ages.
The Bulletin’s old friend, Caradoc Kerry,
who suffers almost as much froin false accusa-
tions as the hero of a melodrama, has been
acquitted in London of the charge of having fed to
the sharks a consignment of holy tracts consigned
to him for the moral edification of niggers.
“ Hexham A circumstance that perhaps
has a little to do with Willis’ success in delaying
extradition is the fact that Bale, Chief Justice of
Natal, is the son of a house and land agent him-
self. Thirty years ago he used to assist the old man
in the business. Is there a feiiow-feeling among
land agents ?
An Anglican parson in the northern parts
of S.A runs his scattered parish by means of a
motor bicycle. On Christmas Day he finished a
service at 11.15, and was due to begin another
seven miles away at 11.30. The distance was done
in 12 minutes, which shows that the church can
rise to the occasion all right.
H. C. Callahan, who managed the Lake
View Consols mine (Westralia) when it was

The Rev. Fitchett comes back to Australia
to remark :
I am warmly convinced that, after all, Australia is

be a reformed character and abandon altogether
the Stinking Fish party.
The sturdiest old fellow in Adelaide is
Surgeon-Major Hinton, father-in-law of Under-
secretary Sholl. He is 93 years old, but during
the recent heat wave he started out on a 35-mile
coach journey in search of coolness in the hills, >
and, being dissatisfied with the place when he got
there, moved across country to a more attractive
resort. He is an Indian half-pay officer, who has
seen much service in China and other parts ot
Asia.
A. W. Sandford, the big dairy merchant
who recently died in Adelaide, once sat in the
Legislative Council—the Lethal Chamber, as
Kingston called it—in the Ass interest. He
startled his conservative colleagues by earnestly
advocating the compulsory repurchase of large
estates for closer settlement. So when his time
expired he was not pressed by the Ass to stand
again. The Ass said bitterly, “We have been
deceived in this man.”
Kingston gets no better, and nowadays is
seldom seen even in Adelaide. He has become a
recluse at his seaside residence, Marino, near
Brighton. He is a great loss; Australia can
badly spare the only brilliant democratic Federal
politician who had a backbone all the time.
When Kingston dies it should be put on his
tombstone, “ Buzzed to death by the loquacity of
the mosquito Pumpkin Smith.” His illness began
with the interminable stonewall over the tariff.
London Times allusion to the
cold shoulder shown by British war
officialdom to Torpedo Whitehead,
lately deceased, merely draws atten-
tion to a similar coldness exhibited for
nearly a quarter of a century to Tor-
pedo Louis Brennan, of Australia.
The war authorities in London re-
luctantly adopted Louis, praised him
grudgingly, paid him liberally, and
dropped him into obscurity-whenever
they could. The reason is just that
the torpedo is the worst foe of the
greatest warship. The British Gov-
ernment bought Louis Brennan’s
ideas merely lest some hostile Power
might buy them. When Louis, down
in Melbourne, worked his cotton reel
on an engine-room table (the first germ
of his torpedo) he struck a great idea.
Berry and Service sent him to
England. But then set in, a, time of
lingering apd exhibiting and waiting
and trying again. The British war
authorities saw then that a small
enemy with a first-class torpedo outfit
might, with luck and good manage-
ment, destroy their own gigantic fleet;
and while they paid their torpedoists
liberally, they wished such men had
never been born.
. It strikes one as odd to see
“ Gipsy ” Smith, the English revival-
ist, who has recently been threatening
a second descent on Australia, referred
to in some papers as “Mr. Gipsy
Smith,” while in the same papers the
pugilists who travel similarly on a
nickname never get “Mister.” Why
should the professional pulpit-puncher
have this advantage over the body-
smiter? Smith has become so highly
respectable that he probably carries
“ Mr. Gipsy Smith ” visiting cards,
and keeps his private motor-car like
Salv’arriiy Booth. Smith began as a
fiery, untamed disciple of Booth when the
Salv’army man was also fiery and untamed, but
afterwards took to ranting on his own account.
Both Smith and Booth have become prosperous
on the religious game.
Professor Jethro Brown, a few years ago
in the Law chair of Sydney University, goes back
to his Alma Mater, Adelaide. Dr. Brown is a
rolling stone. He is a native of S.A., and has
already held professorships in Hobart, Sydney,
Dublin, and Wales. His most permanent address
is on top of a cart of furniture, removing his effects
to some new location, and his dog’s most perma-
nent address is running behind the cart. And
Professor Jethro is still a young, man.
“ N.” : Bessemer’s autobiography has just
reached these shores. One of the worst stabs
England ever got was the invention of Bessemer
steel. The United States now make more steel
than all the rest of the world put together, and
Bessemer was the foundation of the German
Krupps, in their big development. Bessemer had
114 patents, for all sorts of things, even for sugar
manufacture. At 17 years old he invented
perforated stamps for deeds and such papers.
One official said these saved the Government
£lOO,OOO a year, through prevention of fraud.
Bessemer was promised a post office billet, but
never got that nor any pecuniary reward whatever.
He invented a projectile, but Britain wouldn’t look
at it. Napoleon 111. took him up. The necessity for
stronger guns led to his inventing Bessemer steel.
Its discovery is held to rank in importance with
those of America, the compass, printing, steam,
and electricity. Up to Bessemer’s time steel could
not be made with more than 501 b. in a crucible, but
Bessemer made five tons at once at one-eighth the
cost. Yet the British authorities were obstinate,
resting on an assurance by Armstrong that steel
could never be made into cannon. It is estimated
that British gunnery was thus put back 20 years.

DRUNK: “Shay, landlord (hie) put those drinksh

The S.A. Assembly contains at least one
humorist. He is a member of the National Ass
party, and his claim to be a humorist lies in the
following clause which he wanted to add to the
Vermin Bill of last session :
Any person who imports into or lets loose on Kangaroo
Island, or any of the other islands on the coast of South
Australia, or knowingly permits to -be set or let loose
thereon, or if found alive on any vessel touching those
islands, any fox, wild dog, rabbit, or other vermin, shall
on conviction be liable to a term of imprisonment, with
or without hard labor, for a term of not less than twelve
months.
This wild and whirling proposal that any person
found alive on any vessel should be imprisoned for
12 months, and that the rabbit should be gaoled
with hard labor, unfortunately fell through.
Joseph Carruthers has got down to "the
level at which even Thomas Bent gibes at him.

his father and mother were

this frail conveyance the
youth who was to afflict
Australia with so many

in those days.
Painter Herkomer
once applied for a position
as “bones” to an English
Christy Minstrel troupe,
but there was no vacancy,
so he continued to spread
colors on canvas. Most
Melbournites would gladly
have given sixpence to see
Herkomer as Brudder
Bones, instead of helping
to pay £945 for the “ por-
trait” by him, in their National Gallery, of
the late forgotten Queen Victoria. The picture
is said to have been painted from a statue,
or from an earthenware mug “ For a Good Girl,’’’
and certainly looks like it.
Civil engineer C. Napier Bell, who re-
cently died of dropsy at Derby (Tas.),'focussed his
theodolite in many countries. He was born in
Rothsay (Scotland) in 1835, and spent some of his
youth m South America. His education was
chiefly Scotch, but his “ ticket ” came, from the
Institute of Civil Engineers, London.- About
1869 he was at work in South America, surveying
sections of the San Paulo (Brazil) railway, and the
harbor of Buenos Ayres. Back in Europe, he was
engineer on the construction of the Baxtel en
Weselline, from Holland into Prussia, and pre-
pared plans of gasworks and waterworks for
Bereditchcheff, South Russia. He began his
Australasian career in 1871, when he did some
Maoriland Government survey work, and followed
on with the survey of some 260 miles of railway
route for Messrs. Brogden and Sons, in both
islands. Next, he appeared in Tasmania to pre-.
pare plans of harbor improvements for the Tamar
River and Launceston. Returning to Maoriland
in the ’Bo’s, he was a member of the Royal Com-
mission which sorted out the various mountain
passes to find a practicable route for a line from
the east to the west coast of the South Island, and
when the Commission had reported, he surveyed
and prepared plans of the line through Arthur’s
Pass and the Otira Gorge. Also, he planned
sewerage and waterworks for Westport. In Tas-
mania again in the early ’9o’s, he planned the
Strahan to Mount Lyell line; harbor works at
Macquarie, and a breakwater at Devonport.
Later he worked professionally in N.S.W. and
S.A. His last important public appearance was
as a member of the Royal Commission which re-
ported upon the Adelaide outer harbor' scheme '

Bank of Victoria, he entered the Education De-
partment, and afterwards had a school at Fitzroy,
1 where he helped to train the loose but eloquent
intellect of the late W. Shiels. He became. Ed-

George Brown, who has just been re-

Boucaut cross when convicted in 1903. Remark-
ing that the First Offenders’ Act was a failure, he
referred to his own'l2 previous convictions (all in
Sydney), arid suggested that he should be dis-
charged under an imaginary “Hardened Offenders’
Act,” which had “ never been tried, and might do
some good.” The scandalised Judge called him a
licensed villain and a brazen ruffian, and gave him
eight years.
Some more particulars from “ H. 8.”
about Daniel Cameron and the gold-shod horse :
Daniel Cameron, who died at Lilydale (Vic.) the other
day, in his 87th year, was once a representative of Beech-
worth in the Legislative Assembly. His supporters sub- '
scribed £2OOO to give him the qualification then required.
“Tinker” Brown, a circus proprietor, had a horse shod.,
with gold for the successful candidate to, ride the day
after the election, but on Cameron calling on Brown to
remonstrate he found that the latter had just died
suddenly.
Why Cameron wanted to remonstrate with Tinker
Brown and what Tinker Brown died of are both,
left unexplained. Possibly Brown perished sud- 1
denly from mumps. • And the reason why Tinker-
Brown spent his money on golden shoes for a,-
horse is also a mystery.

But something to delight me
And whirl the land along 1

With walks and kisses rife ;
Of merry eyes a-glancing
Afar from all the strife ;
Of bridal horses prancing—
It may be mere romancing,
But, after all, it’s Life !

To hear that music sung
In balladry elating
While yet our hearts are young ;
A ditty free from hating,
Just glad and elevating—
The song of every tongue.

Away from Vain Regretting,
And you shall still be King !

Disease-Breeding
Uric Acid.
Uric acid is the predisposing cause of Gout,
Rheumatism, Nervous Debility, and Mental De-
spondency.
Uric acid checks the efficient filtering power of
the kidneys, and leads to the development of
Gravel, Stone, Lumbago, Diabetes, and Bright s
Disease.
Uric acid, again, is one of the chief causes of
constipation, that arch-thief of health.
In short, excessive uric acid is a well-known
blood poisoner, which infects brain, nerves, tissue,
and muscle.
The grandest remedy in the world for kidney
trouble and all uric acid diseases is undoubtedly
Kutnow’s Powder.
The leading physicians of Lofidon, Paris, Berlin
and New York have tested the power of Kutnow’s
Powder as a natural solvent and eliminant of uric
acid.
The result has been a veritable triumph for
Kutnow’s Powder. They not only prescribe it in
their private and hospital practice, but use it
personally as a guard against serious disease.
PROF. F. H. GRIFFIN, M.D., wrote: “I
only wish every soul in the world used Kutnow’s
Powder. They would experience great benefit.”
Kutnow’s Powder is a most delightful, refresh-
ing health draught, nerve-bracing and exhilarating.
It is absolutely free from sugar, pleasant to the
taste, and always gives entire satisfaction. A
nation’s wealth is a nation’s health. Those who
value health take Kutnow’s Powder.
The Loss of Nerve-Power and
the Remedy.
The nerves are connected with all the organs and tissues of the body.
When, therefore, the stomach, liver, kidneys, bowels, and gall bladder are
disordered or diseased the nerves consequently are bound to suffer, and the
brilliant, energetic, shrewd and busy man gradually wanes in mental and
physical capacity. The dyspeptic individual is invariably of an irritable or
nervous nature ; his digestive organs being impaired are gradually depriving
him of nerve-power and laying up a source of trouble and life of misery for
the future. Little do people think when they complain of nervous headache,
neuralgia, restlessness, insomnia, that the trouble arises in the stomach. The
question is how to regain this nerve-power. The answer is by using the one
remedy which is now endorsed and prescribed by all the leading physicians
in both hemispheres, and also most highly praised in the British Medical
Press ; and this remedy is Kutnow’s Powder.
—— i
IMPORTANT CAUTION!
All respectable Chemists sell Kutnow’s Powder, but there are others who,
for the sake of a little extra profit, will attempt to foist upon you some cheap
imitation of their own. It is well known that these cheap concoctions are
highly dangerous, and in the case of delicate, sensitive persons, capable of
inflicting permanent injury. Kutnow’s Powder is pure, painless, palatable,
free from sugar, and absolutely harmless. See that the fac-simile signature,
“ S. Kutnow and Co., Ld.” and the registered trade mark, “ Hirschensprung,
or Deer Leap,” are on the carton in which the bottle is packed, and also on
the label on the bottle. This signature and trade mark will alone insure your
obtaining the
Genuine KUTNOW’S POWDER.

A LEADING PRACTITIONER WRITES,#
“Columbia Hospital, Chicago, June 10th, 1904.
“ It gives me pleasure to state with what satis-
faction I have used Kutnow’s Powder in my
practice. I find that it is a gentle laxative and
gastric sedative, which overcomes the most dis-
tressing symptoms so often remembered by patients
with so much dread. It soon controls the gastric
distress, keeps up gentle peristalsis and laxity, the
importance of which, surgeons appreciate.

“For some months past I have suffered very

REV. CHARLES RHODES WRITES:

“ Peterborough, May 31st, 1904.
“ After a more extended use of Kutnow*i
Powder, I can testify to its efficacy. I have been
taking it for about a month for sluggish liver, and
it has done me more good than anything else I

POLITICAL
POINTS
The decrease of exports in most lines of
British manufacture is indirectly shown in the
eagerness with which recent petty increases in
other lines are recorded. For instance, we have
the loud announcement that “nearly £200,000 of
Eottery has been shipped from Staffordshire to
’African ports within the past 10 months.”
Reported from Melbourne that
exporters of various lines of produce are evincing- a
growing desire to have the Government grading stamp
attached to their goods before leaving Victoria.
But when State grading was first proposed what
a howl there was over the “ruin of the export
trade by Socialistic interference ! ”
Lecturer John T. Brown, of Kentucky
(U.S.A.), who is doing a talk round the world,
arrived at Adelaide the other day from Maoriland,
and told a Register interviewer;—
I think if we were to adopt its (Maoriland’s) Arbitration
law it would be beneficial to us. The general method in
my country to raise wages is to strike, with what disas-
trous results to trade every reader knows.
After all the bang and blare and row about
“ the Wrongs of N.5.W.,” it was quite a relief to
come on a letter in the S.M. Herald last week on
“the Wrongs of Hornsby.” It seems that all
Hornsby’s postage stamps are printed at Sydney,
and its revenue goes to support the adjacent bank-
rupt State of Pennant Hills. A'lso the Governor-
General should have landed there first, and didn’t.
The federation of the Australian States is
a beautiful and brotherly achievement. The
N.S.W. Government refused to contribute an
exhibit of N.S.W. timber to the forthcoming
Melbourne Exhibition of Australian Products.
Carruthers officially professed deep regret at his
inability to pay the expenses of despatching a load
of wood to Melbourne. A fine Commonwealth
spirit of economy restrained him.
“P.” ; I notice from Uncle Malouf’s letter
to Deakin about Uncle Malouf’s undesirable nephew
Malouf : (1) that Uncle employs 25 white girls;
(2) that there are 7000 Maloufs in Syria. Now, if
Uncle were allowed to bring out all his relations
named Malouf, there would, I presume, be em-
ployment for 175,000 white girls right away. Has
this aspect of the case received the attention it de-
serves ?
Bung, the publican, will probably have a
member of his own in next N.S.W. Parliament.
Parliament tends to become a delegation of par-
ticular interests, each delegate prepared to crush
the rest for the exaltation of his own mission.
The Bung candidate’s mission will be for Bung 1,
N.S.W. 2, Commonwealth 3, Empire 4, the World
5 ; but the day he forgets Bung 1, out he goes,
battered to political death with tanglefoot pewters.
One very real grievance of N.S.W. against
the Commonwealth, which no one seems to have
mentioned so far, is the fact that the Federal
High Court—two-thirds of its Judges belong to
N.S.W.—has found over 75 per cent, of the judg-
ments of the N.S.W. Full Court, which have come
before it on appeal, to be wrong, and has reversed
or modified them without even consulting Joey
Carruthers, Dr. Creed, Syd. Law, or Geo. Pile’s
Dog.
The “British Australasian Society,” which
seems to consist mainly of foreign land-grabbers,
whose connection with Australia is very much the
same as that of the spider with the fly that has
got in his web, has written to Queensland Premier
Morgan protesting against the recently-proposed
Land Monopoly Tax. To talk of land monopoly
in a State of about 428,000,000 acres when only
17,000,000 acres are alienated is absurd, says the
spider. Of course it is. Also, when next any
fat member of the society wants to visit Australia,
and finds the saloon all taken up, it will be absurd
for him to talk of being able to get no accommo-
dation, so long as there’s room in the stokehole.
Some extracts from George Reid’s recent
address to the electors of Queensland on the Anti-
Socialism crusade:—
A true national basis . . . best instincts and aspirations
of the workers of this continent . . . broad aspirations
for the general welfare . . . broad basis of political action
. . . broad and general in its scope . . . broad and
shining path of true liberalism.
What is the matter with passing a short Bill through
the Australian Parliament providing that every
time a candidate mentions the word “broad” at
next election he shall be fined £10? It is so
obviously impossible for the Reid crowd to get
along without saying “ broad ” that the measure
would break it up irreparably.
Away lack la 1900, an Act passed by
Premier Holder gave the S. Australian publican
six years’ notice to quit—that is to say, after six
years he could be local-optioned out of his pub.
without compensation. The laying waste of Bung
begins at the end of this year, and both the beer
party and the anti-beer party are already girding
uip their loir s for a battle of giants. It is expected
that about one-third of the public-houses in Ade-
laide will disappear at the first shock of the engage-
ment.
The Queensland Government, to further
the White Australia policy in the sugar districts,
hoped to set aside in each centre suitable land for
small farms, upon which the white laborers could
employ their time during the slack season.
Inquiries, however, have shown that, though
there is plenty of scrub land in nearly every
sugar district, it is locked up in the hands of
private speculators. Yet the House of Fossils
said there was no need for the Monopoly Tax Bill,
and ejected that measure with contumely and both
feet.
On the same day that news came that, out
of the first batch of members elected to the new
British Parliament, four-fifths were Freetraders,
another item came to hand to the effect that an
order for 440 railway cars for the London Metro-
politan railway had go;.?, to Protectionist Germany,
to ithe great grief of British employers and work-
men. The two items looked well side by side and
made a really interesting coincidence. It might
be put thus: Election returns^—l 2 Tariff Re-
formers, 47 Freetraders, 440 jobs lost to the
British (workman.
Red tape is a great circumstance ! It is
just two months since a Home Affairs pay clerk
levanted, leaving behind him a shortage. An
ordinary business firm would have accepted this
disappearance as an intimation that the billet was
vacant and have dismissed the matter from its
mind long since, but the Public Service must do
everything in proper form, or bust. So the clerk
was suspended, a notification was sent to his late
address that he was requested to appear and
explain his conduct, and an enquiry was held into
his irregular proceedings. After considering the
matter thoughtfully, and making due allowance
for .the absence of defence, the lost clerk was
dismissed, j .
COURAGEOUS.
SOLICITOR (to his collector): “ Well, did Casey ‘pay ye that money he owes us?”
COLLEOTOR: “He won't pay it; an’ he says he’ll shoot me if I ask him for it
SOLICITOR : “Let him shoot ye, an’ be hanged, to him. Sure, Oi despise his dir-rty threats.”
Australia is going vsry
of trying electric traction, on
many (counicfes-itfeey are
isolated trains, each eafryiiig^iys:heub of,,
machinery, its own little fire, ltsowri fuel, ''aim its
own bucket of water are very wasteful affairs, and
they are making a beginning at electric traction.
The time should come before very long when a
small, brisk, perky vehicle will leave Sydney for
Melbourne every hour instead of a great hulking
train twice every 24 hours. It is a wonder Owe’-
Sullivan didn’t think of floating a loan on this
subject.
Major-General French, while on a visit to
Brisbane, where he was Commandant for eight
years, told the people some wholesome truths
about Defence: —
The best rifles and the best ammunition were necessary
—one of the first essentials. They could not rely upon
the imported stuff, for the private industrial firms could
not be trusted. Australia wanted an arms and ammuni-
tion factory of its own, run by the Government. It
would be too late to discover that they had inferior
material when they were using it on'an enemy. The
matter was more important tp the Commonwealth than
most pebple imagined. He implored AulfyAlia to hesitate
no longer, but to set about the establishment of such a
factory.
A Melbourne M * „» *«. .
The Bent Ministry has perpetrated another job in the ap-
pointment of theson of Le vien, M.L. A., aconstant supporter
of the Government, as" Victorian representative in “ the
East ” at £75(1 a yfearr Levi corns not yet 30, and his only
claim tip fame so” far-is tiiaU’he' Is Felix Levien’s boy.
But thej old man had his eye on the chairmanship of the
Geelong Harbor Trust, and Bent had fixed this up for
Holden, iM. L. A., so Bent decided to put £750 a year of State
money in little Levien’s Christmas stockings .and so-
pleased pa by being kind to pa’s son. A few days after
the Levien business was made public Bent appointed
Sinclair, the late State Agent in London, who quarrelled
with Agent-General Taverner, another agent in “ the
East,” which means the North, and people were beginning
to wonder whether Victoria was to keep a standing army
of agents in China and Japan. There was an outcry in
the press, and Bent suddenly revolved on his public
axis, and said that Sinclair was intended for South
Africa, and that he had said so all along. When it was
pointed out that he used the term “East,” he demanded
in a voice like the roar of the Bull of Bashan, “ Well,
isn’t Africa East? It’s South-east, anyhow. That’s
blooming well East enough.” And certainly Africa is East
—if you go to it round Cape Horn
An alleged “British Australasian Society,”
writing to Premier Morgan (Queensland) about
his Land Monopoly Tax proposals, said it was
monstrous to tax land in order to force the holders
“to bring their estates into the market for sale
without regard to whether there is a demand for
them or not.” The large hole in that argument
occurs just there ; for if there isn’t any demand
for the land, it hasn’t any value ; and if it hasn’t
any value the owners won’t be taxed. What the
absentee landlords meant, but took care they
didn’t say, was that there isn’t a demand for the
land at the extortionate prices they mostly ask
for it—extortionate prices which would-be farmers
can’t pay and at the same time live decently.
The lives of Bernard Hoskins and George
M‘Nair, who were mixed up in the Willis charges,
are an endless remand. Last week they were
postponed at Sydney Water Police Court for the
eleventh time; “the Crown,” as represented
by Joseph Carruthers and co., has now lingered
over their cases for five months and made no
visible progress. It is understood that “ the
Crown ” is waiting for the weary Willis, who still
lingers like the millennium and cometh not. As
for the Lands Commission, it is nominally alive
somewhere, and it is understood that it will meet
again on the sixth Friday of the month, or some
similar date. If only something would happen to
break up the dire monotony of all this waiting!
Waxellency Madden, speaking as the
guest of Bent’s Government at a send-off dinner,
dealt adroitly with the notorious Tom-foolishness
of .the red-faced man. ‘ ‘ Much criticism had been
levelled against the Premier,” said the oily
Waxellency, “because he resorted to methods
which appeal to .the hearts of the people. It was
said, for instance, that Mr. Bent ought not to go
singing comic songs about the country. (Laugh-
ter.) He knew many people sang badly—perhaps
as badly as Mr. Bent (renewed laughter)—but
then they probably did nothing else, whilst Mr.
Bent, on the contrary, was a busy politician.
(Hear, hear.)” Having scored a “hear, hear”
for the undeniable assertion that Bent is busy,
the crafty apologist broke fresh ground, leaving
the audience in doubt as to whether he meant to
say that Bent had done well in singing so badly,
or whether he ' was so busy making a mess of
things that it was a wonder he didn’t sing worse.
A corespondent, whom The Bulletin
• has discovered telling the truth hitherto, submits
■ that calls for public inquiry :
•y jCane Taruieis in N.S.VV. are entirely at the mercy of the
•* Q.S.R. Co., which holds a virtual monopoly of the manu-
facturing and refining industry in the State. The only
Opposition it has is almost nominal, and the C.S.R. Co.
simply permits it to exist for the sake of appearances.
Under these circumstances, it isn’t surprising that the
growers are Being, squeezed hard. The Australian Parlia-
ment, when deciding on the rebate, contemplated that
the whole of it would go into the hands of the growers of
“ White ” cane. But the po. has disposed of this intention
by .gradually cutting into the price paid. This season it
took advantage of the frosted cane, and paid as low as one
penny per ton for cane which would fetch 12s. if.un-
affected. This cane was worth more than the price paid,
or was worth nothing. The co. took good care it crushed
t.iie stuff. Fortunately for Queensland, there are some
State mills in that country, which render any such treat-
ment practically impossible.
The news that came to hand on Monday
about the first batch' of the British elections
(held on Saturday) suggests that the old
defunct aristocrats of England must have spent
Sunday whirling round in their graves. For that
Saturday, before the dead dukes began to revolve,
was the day when the Chinamen of South Africa
came home to roost. Ex-Premier Balfour lost his
...seat ;tafe> 'bjN Nearly 2000 votes,
and in England, where people don’t throw
out Premiers or ex-Premiers in the off-
hand way that this country threw out
George Dibbs and Neil Lewis, that means a
wonderful upheaval. It suggests that the foun-
tains of the great deep have burst “something
unusual.” Sixty-six members had been definitely
elected by -Saturdriv night of these w«-e
Tories or Unionists, and these two old
parties combined were just keeping ahead of
the new Labor party, which had captured
11 seats. The old two-party system, so dear to
English precedent, seems as dead as Job this time.
Six parties are raving at the polls—Liberals, Con-
servatives, Unionists, Unionist Freetraders,
Labor men, and Irish Nationalists ; and Tradition
—good old British Tradition —has become a gib-
bering idiot with straws in its hair. Probably
nothing much will happen even with all these
parties, but on the surface of things there is
almost chaos enough for a Greek election.
Premier Bent has started the idea of hold-
ing an international exhibition in Melbourne, and
as the dreadful Boom is always associated with the
last exhibition, the said idea should be received
with a shudder. Further, no exhibition should
be again held in Australia until a large and varied
assortment of Australian manufactures are fairly
established with the aid of a high tariff. Many
of the present lines of local production are merely
foreign-made goods put together here, and though
in a number of instances local production can com-
pete with the foreign manufacture, still Bent’s pro-
posed exhibition would be a great deal too much
of an aid to the foreign importer and a great deal
too little of a real Australian show.
In one issue of a Wellington (N.S.W.)
paper The Bulletin notices advts. from Fong
Lee & Co., universal providers; L. M. Malouf
(Syrian), draper; Malouf & Shalala (Syrians),
produce merchants and wool-buyers; J. P.
Malouf (Syrian), storekeeper; Louis Sarquis
(Syrian, but he publicly boasts that he is a
naturalised British subject), draper. One turns
from those advts. with some relief to find that one
Moses stands the brunt of the competition and
runs an I.X.L. store. The Assyrian may come
down like a wolf, but Moses is mighty and stands
his ground. The “ white trash ” generally seem
to have mostly disappeared from Wellington in
N.S.W.
“San Remo” : We have about a .dozen
councils round Brisbane, and the bos3 one is the
Brisbane City Council. Some years ago the
B.C.C. decided to wood-block the two main
streets, George-street and Queen-street (say li
miles of wood-blocking). A contract was signed
for £35,000, and work was commenced. Then
things began to happen. There were extras,
alterations of plans, things overlooked, etc., etc. —
those etceteras were yards long. The final cost
of that wood-blocking ran into £BO,OOO, and
there was a howl of anguish when the bill came
in. Fiery talk drifted round, . and bitter
things were told about papers, plans, etc. ; but,
as usual, nothing came of it—except the bill. The
bill is there yet.
General-manager Teece, of the A.M.P.
Society, giving evidence before the Federal Old
Age Pensions Commission at Sydney :
The effect must be to sap the spirit of independence
and self-reliance which had always been so marked a
characteristic of the Anglo-Saxon race. Life assurance
offices and friendly societies, which have proved such
potent agencies for self-help to the race, were still
available, and were within the reach of almost every
worker in the land. If recourse were had to these in
early life, they would find few industrious, thrifty
workers seeking the dole of the Old Age Pension office.
Of course manager Teece honestly believes that
Old Age Pensions “ sap the spirit of independence,
etc.,” but what would his opinion be if he hadn’t
happened to be an insurance potentate, who iz
paid to view life as one huge insurance policy ?
Dobson, of Tasmania, just back from a
holiday, again digs up that mysterious capi-
alist :
It was only the other day that I heard of a large capi-
talist who was desirous of establishing a large manufac-
turing business in Victoria or N.S.W. . . but immediately
he was told of the restriction put in the way of importing
skilled' and other labor he declined to entertain the
matter further.
That good old sham capitalist whose name and
address and occupation are never given, who
never used to happen along in the days when
there were no restrictions on the importation of.
labor, and whom no one ever meets except the.
Tory person away for a holiday ! He was interest-
ing at first, but as the Tory person never will give
particulars so that his capitalist can be verified,
the community in general has at last given up
believing his tale, and regards him nowadays as
a humorous fraud.
Yankee papers get hold of some curious
copy at times. ’Frisco Chronicle prints the
story of James De Conlay—“special travelling
representative of a dozen or so of Australia’s
largest daily newspapers ” /.
Municipal ownership is the bane and curse of Aus-
tralia and of all European cities in which it has been tried,
or is being tried.
In Australia 7iiunicipal ownership practically is non-
existent now, and the term is a joke.
Australia is the best possible example of the failure of
Government ownership of railroads. It has only 16,000
miles of railroads, of six different gauges, and many are
useless.
As a Stinking Fish expert and purveyor of false-
hoods, James De Conlay looks equal to the task
of representing “a hundred or so ” of Australia’s
largest dailies. Fancy a man being fool enough
to say (1) that “municipal ownership is the bane
and curse of Australia, ” and (2) that “in Australia
municipal ownership is practically non-existent
now.” And the six different railway gauges !! !
King O’Malley of the Incredible Hat made
some breezy remarks while listening, as a member
of the Federal Old Age Pensions Commission,
while Mr. Stephen Murphy, the Sydney magis-
trate, was telling of the frauds attempted by would-
be pensioners. A few extracts:—
Mr. O’Malley : “ Jerusalem ! ”
More evidence.
Mr. O’Malley : “ Ghost! ”
Evidence about an applicant with £212 in the bank.
Mr. O’Malley : “Gee!”
Remarkable statement about a pensioner who got
drunk.
Mr. O’Malley : “ Gracious me ! ”
Complicated statement about two widows.
Mr. .O’Malley : “ Well, I never ! ”
Facts about two immoral pensioners who were full of
beer.
Mr. O’Malley : “ Shocking ! ”
Remarks about a pensioner with £3OO.
Mr. O’Malley : “ Good Lord ! ”
There is no evidence that Mr. O’Malley said
“Geewhiz” or “Gosh,” but he seems to have
said almost everything else.
Two essentials to the political leader are
a strong policy and a strong backbone. But
although King Richard won through the aid of
these.appiirtenances, what he owed to his right
bower.—z/e. the right brand—should not be over-
looked. The strongest backbone and policy can
find additional strength from the well administered
offices of D.C.L., the'Whisky of the Wise.*

SPORTING NOTIONS.
J. It. M. Mackay, the Cornstalk batsman, has,
grace of Al. A. Noble and Captain Darling, achieved
***** double century in Australian inter-State cricket.
He had scored 105 in the first innings, and when he and
Noble were at the sticks in the second the Cornstalk
team required only 31 to win by nine wickets. Mackay
had made 73, and it occurred to Noble that if his vis-a-vis
made the whole 31 it would be the long-desired record.
Thereafter Noble merely blocked the balls, and when
he unintentionally slogged them he stayed in his
crease and never attempted to run. Meanwhile
Mackay slogged and slashed and drove and cut
at vi* Bashi-Bazouk on the drunk. Darling protested.
Noble never even replied to the protest, and went on
stonewalling, and Mackay got his record. But as
Ecclesiastes said of other vanities, there is no joy in it,
and its glory is utterly extinguished by the fact that had
Captain Darling liked to indulge in the same sort of sharp
practice he could have burst up the record by bowling
boundary wides to Noble. To make a record with the
assistance of your own side and by the grace of your
opponent is a hollow, hollow performance, and one that
Mackay won’t be proud of when his judgment is more
matured.
* * * *
James Rainey Munro Mackay is just now the
cricketer on whom the limelight is turned—this by reason
°‘ his bogus record. All the same, Mac is a mighty hitter,
and always has been. He is 6ft. tall, with 12st. of hard
humanity behind his weight, and he lifts the leather far.
When he played in New England in his prehistoric days
centuries were common performances with him. It was
during the 1902-3 season that he came to Sydney and
played for Burwood, and he found the turf wic-
kets vastly different from the asphalt and con-
crete ones of New England. During the season
he scored 270 runs at an average of 45. and
, 57 a ? d 37 for the N ' S - W - XIII. against the
.Australian XI. In 1903 he improved, averag-
68't? ’ but * n 1904 his average dropped to
54.9. He first represented the State in 1902, when
ou r , ~,e ! ”ht and one against Queensland. His first
Sheffield Shield match was in December, 1903, when he
scored 56 and none against South Australia. The same
month he scored two and 25 against Victoria, and two
and nine against Warner’s M.0.C., which is, so far, his
only international appearance. Last season he failed in
the southern tour, and was dropped for the Sydney
matches. Had he played up to anything like his present
form, he would almost certainly have gone to England
with the XI. After the XI. had sailed for England, he
scored 67 against Tasmania and 131 against Queensland.
At the beginning of this season he burst all over the
place : 202 against Queensland, 90 against S.A., 194
agamst Victoria, and then 105, and (by the help of Noble)
102 against S.A. in the return match. His score for the
season is 1281 for 10 completed innings, averaging 128'10
per innings.
* * * *
at “, B \” : ,. The in cident in the S.A. match when
Noble declined to run for hits made by himself, in order
to allow Mackay to achieve an Australian record for a
double century, created some ill feeling. Darling, the
opposing captain, threatened reprisals but unfortunately
Jake Reedman dissuaded him. No real good would have
been done to the game of cricket, but an interesting
situation would have been created if the fieldsmen had
sat down to discuss politics until the batsman chose to
run. Run he would have had to in order to win the
match, otherwise, having waited for a reasonable time,
Darling could have claimed the game.
A * * *
Had the Noble-Mackay incident occurred in
Adelaide or Melbourne, with the “self-sacrifice” on the
side of a South Australian or Victorian cricketer, the
Sydney papers would have brought out special editions
and demanded immediate secession on account of the
insult to the Mother State.
The S.A. habit of winning just one cricket-
match during the season—never more than one—is be-
coming quite uncanny. No matter what the apparent
chances, somebody goes down. For three years past, the
victim has been Victoria playing in Melbourne. Four
years ago it was Warner’s “amateur” team ; the year
before that, it was England (Maclaren’s XI., just off the
voyage). For three preceding seasons, N.S.W. has been
beaten, and Victoria for three before that-and that gets
back to the time when S.A. was capable of winning the
Sheffield Shield. So Adelaide people keep on hoping,
though they haven’t seen an inter-State game won on
their own ground since 1900, when N.S.W. went down
thump, by an innings.

The Kelly benefit is promising to turn out as
good as an English tour for the retiring wicket-keeper
Up to Saturday night last £962 had been collected, and
by the time the match is over the sum will no doubt have
reached four figures.
The interest evaporated, as far as play was con-
cerned, very suddenly in the Kelly Benefit cricket match.
The Australian XI. went to the wickets and scored 226 in
a quiet, unostentatious way. Darling’s 66 was the top
score, while Armstrong and Cotter supplied a couple of
eggs, and Bill Howell was caught for two. The hero of the
ball was J. A. O’Connor, whose bowling was responsible
for the fall of six wickets at a cost of 50 runs. NSW
played miserably. J. R. Mackay, who had established a
record in the inter-State match earlier in the week (by
the connivance of Noble and the grace of Darling) was
bowled by Cotter for four. Then Diamond, who had
soared up into the neighborhood of a century against
S.A., vanished for a round nought. The Rev. Waddy was
bowled by Armstrong before he had broken the ice or
blown off the froth from the goblet of runs, and Carter
Penman and O’Connor made only 15 among them. It was
an awful collapse, and it is amazing how badly these
cracks can play at times. Laver was the deadly bowler
of the occasion, taking three wickets for 16 runs, and
catching Carter off Armstrong’s bowling. As this issue
goes to press the scores are: Australia, 226 and 465;
N.S.W., 140 first innings, and two wickets down for 254 ’
At present both sides are doing their best to make the
match spin out for several days of gate money.
* • * *
Rev. Waddy, who has a charge, or a living, or
whatever they call it in Australia—at Singleton (N.S.W.)
went home on Saturday evening to preach the Word tO'
his flock on the Sunday, and started out again at 6 a.m
Monday morning to get back to Sydney and take part in
the Kelly Benefit Match.
* * * *
About the most interesting item in the Kelly
benefit match was the changed attitude of “ the Hill ” at.
Sydney Cricket Ground towards Duff, Trumper, Noble
and Cotter. Toaman “ the Hill” wanted N.S.W. to win’
and the chilling silence which followed a cut for four by
Victor Trumper had, as an Irish-Scot put it, an uncanny
sound. When Cotter was thumping them down in his.
usual dangerous fashion the crowd said “boo-hoo,” and
once when Waddy ducked to save his skull an irate
Glebeite yelled “ You cow 1” When Penman, the ’Varsity
express, copied Cotter’s tactics, the crowd was joyous,,
and expressed approval in a loud voice as Duff limped,
about his wicket, and when Noble stopped a hot one on
his leg “ the Hill ” was frantically merry.

S. Australia’s new bowler Wright, although he-
did well in the first innings of the Victorian match, does,
not strike critics as first-class, and the Crow-eaters have
yet to unearth a worthy successor to the lamented
George Giffen. Anyhow, there is not the slightest doubt
ol Wright’s capacity as a batsman. Here are his averages
tor the inter-state campaign Innings, 6 : runs 0 •
highest score, 0 ; times not out, 0 ; average, 0. A most
globular-looking record.
* * * *
Although there is another match to be played
against Victoria, it can make no difference in the destina-
w Sheffield Shield, which has again been won by
xn.b. w.—for the fifth year in succession. The most unfor-
tunate team is that of S.A., which has been defeated 11
times running.
* * • *
Joe Darling is the resurrected wonder in Aus-
tralian cricket. For a while he retired to station life in
Tasmania, but drifted back into South Australian cricket
and finally into the Australian XI. Last tour in England
has seemingly restored the batting qualities of the
veteran ; and in compiling 66 in the first innings for the
XI against N.S.W. in the benefit match, the Australian
XI captain put up the most creditable effort as well as the
highest score on his side.
* * * *
C. E. Poking made a fine 83, not out, in a total
of 188 in South Australia’s second innings against N.S. W.
It was compiled when the wicket was wet, and everything
greatly m favor of the bowlers. He has established a
claim to being the most promising batsman of the team.
* * * *
Victor Trumper has drifted very much out of
the limelight of late. Against S.A. his cricket was
awful, and in the benefit match it was absolutely
schoolboyish. The dash has gone, the smashing strokes
that used to fascinate applauding thousands are no more,
and the bowlers no longer tremble when they open to a
player who is now poor in play and weak in strokes.
Victor Trumper wants a long rest, and is likely to get it,
for his mantle has dropped from him and fallen on Mackav
with a loud bump.
Cricketer Bill’Owell figured in a new role the
other day. Fittingly named Legbreak, owned and trained
by the enduring bowler, got away with the final trot
(l£m.) at Epping (Sydney), cracking much-fancied Mum-
mell Childe up near the finish, and doing the Noses a good
turn. °

Is a paying spectator at a cricket match entitled
to compensation for damages received through the act of
a player? A ball struck by one of the S. Australian
Eleven in the recent match with Victoria at Melbourne
C.C. ground broke a boundary paling, and assaulted the
vest of an onlooker, doing hurt and mischief to his watch.
The victim wrote to the V.C.A., claiming compensation,
and the association laughed his letter out of court. All
the same, it isn’t clear that the watch-owner has no case
against the management of the show, which was either
the V.0.A., or the M. 0.0., or both. The damage was
incidental to the performance. Take the case of the
individual with the performing lion or caterpillar at the
circus. If his lion or caterpillar breaks loose and rends a
spectator, has the victim no claim V If he has, then
there is the same claim against the untamed cricket-ball.

At the opening of the Summer Nights Cycling
on Wednesday last week, Henri Mayer rode with one bare
leg and one encased in a black stocking. One foot was
covered with a shoe, the other worked in a boot. An
unsuperstitious Australian scoffed. Then said the man who
alleged he knew Mayer well: “ There’s a lot of method in
his eccentricity. His left leg was broken and badly cut
once, and the bone is hardly covered by the thin skin ; so
he wears a stocking to hide the scar. His ankle is weak,
so he wears a boot to support it.” Then writer marvelled.
What a wonder this German with the French Christian
name and Jewish family name is. With one leg dicky
one ankle weak, and his stomach full of dope, he rode
like a drunken lightning flash, and won races when he
seemed hopelessly pocketed. Marvellous Mayer !
* * * *
“The Mayer” five-mile scratch race, at Sydney
C.G., the opening night of the Summer wheel-meeting,
showed the man it was named after as a stayer of con-
siderable grit. Also, for getting out of a pocket, the
whizzing German is hard to beat. Passing the Ladies’
.Reserve, he seemed hopelessly hemmed in. Then, in the
twinkling of an eye, he appeared in the very front, with
big George Farley hurling himself through the atmo-
sphere in pursuit. Mayer won by a length ; somehow,
Parley does not seem to have mastered the secret of the
“jump.”
* * * *
In spite of the barracking of the daily press for
the mile sprints, the five-mile races continue to make for
great excitement at Sydney cycling carnival. On Monday
night, “ The Rutt ” was responsible for some splendid
racing. After three miles at a very medium rate had
weeded out a man for each mile, things began to get
exciting. Mutton went off on his lonesome. Sandberg
sprinted up to him, and it looked as though the two were
going to alternately pace. But big George Farley brought
the field up. Then Bearpark broke loose and raged away,
and Sandberg came out again to get the benefit of the
break. For a moment, it looked as though no one would
pace the field, and the people were shouting to the leaders
to go for their lives and make the quarter lap lead safe
while they could. The shouting roused Mayer, and when he
dropped the lead Pye took it up and Sandberg was headed
with only a mile to go. Big Dick Arnst, throwing his
head from side to side like a struggling bullock, his mouth
wide open and draining all the oxygen off the track, went
past the roaring stands at an awful speed and left the
field behind him. After him streaked the red j'ersey of
little Victorian Pye, and the field whizzed behind Pye. As
the bell rang for the last lap the vast Maorilander was
■still in front, raging through the atmosphere. At
the scoring board Rutt sprang to the front; then Mayer
came, but only to fall back as the indistinguishable
mass of riders reeled past him. As they came past the
stands once more 10,000 people stood up and howled as
they saw Yankee Samuelson shoot past Rutt, and Brook,
the Australian, glide past him also, with Scheps coming
fast. But the Yankee lifted himself and left Brook
behind. Rutt, with a desperate effort, came close to the
second man, but was stalled off till the line was crossed.
Had the first part of the race been run at anything like
a good rate it would have been a world’s record, so fast
did the breakers make the pace; and the actual finish
was one of the most tremendous rushes this writer has
, ever seen. As it was, the time for the whole race was
llmin. 1 2-ssec.
* * * •
The beating of Henri Mayer in the second
semi-final of the Leaaue Cup was a picturesque bit of
cycling. The pacer dropped back at the scoring-board,
and Mayer, who was in front, dashed away. Like a flash
Brook shot to the inside position, and he streaked away
faster than a land-agent making for S’Afriea. Mayer
■came with a mighty rush that brought him right on to
Brook’s wheel, and in that position they shot past the
ladies’ stand. Opposite the reserve, however, Brook
fairly lifted his machine into the air, and, with an amaz-
ing leap, went right away from the German champion
by fully two lengths. It was a beautiful bit of general-
ship, but, unfortunately for himself and Australia, Brook
could not repeat it in the final. He was so busy watching
Mayer that he forgot Rutt, and the Adonis of the wheel
is a bad man to forget. Brook made his final spurt too
soon, and by the time he reached the ladies’ reserve was
more or less pumped, and Rutt went by like the wind.
Mayer and Brook struggled for second place, and the
German got it.

The Summer Nights Syndicate is beginning to
wake up to the fact that it is the party that contributes-
■the humble “ bob ” that pays for the show. Hitherto the
band has been stationed in the ladies’ reserve, and the
vocal selections, which have been introduced to make the
show attractive, have been rendered in that quarter also,
and were quite inaudible to the “ mob.” The syndicate
has changed that. On Monday night last the band spent
portion of its time among the shilling multitude, and the
boys also rendered their coon songs there after the ladies,
had been served.

The resignation of Sammy Gillott from the
Melbourne Bicycle Club over the betting at the Austral-
Wheel Race meeting is generally received with scoffs.
Sammy is said t > follow horse-racing, and, so far, has not
threatened to do anything violent unless bookmakers and
betting are put down at Flemington. All the same,
J. R. M. MAOKAY, N.S.W. Champion
Cricketer (by the grace of M. A. Noble
and J. Darling.)
R. etc. by Talma & Co., Sydney & Melbourne.
Sammy is quite right. Unless cycling is to get down to
the, level of horse-racing—in which case it will die
suddenly—the bookmaker must be severely discouraged
® ve “ I {. it P ro ves impossible to suppress him altogether.
If betting must be indulged in at cycle meetings the
totalisator will give a fairer gamble than the bookmaker.
Ikey Noses is a curse without one solitary redeeming'
feature, and should be hit with a meat axe on every
possible occasion.

The latest method by which it is proposed to
reach the South Pole is that of the motor-skate. An
ordinary-shaped motor ear will be fitted with a steel skate
on which the weight of the car will rest. The wheels at
the side will be fitted with spikes to get a grip of the ice
and drive the car along. With this weird device it is
believed that 100 miles a day can be covered, and the Pole
reached and the return journey made without any danger
of famine. It is argued that the idea is quite possible" in
the Antarctic regions, because the ice-field is smooth and
flat, and not like that of the Arctic country, where it is
hummocky and full of crevices and fiords, with great
bergs rising and falling without warning. One thing the
adventurer seems to have forgotten is that down in the
awful cold of Antarctica oils, even the most volatile, will
freeze hard, and unless he can devise a new spray-
ing apparatus, that little fact is like Jim Jeffries* midriff
blow—a clean knock-out.

V.R.C. committee-man Bowden greatly agitated
his milder brethren by calling for an enquiry into the
running of Sylvanite at Plemington in the last race of
the last day of the Cup meeting. No committee-man
seconded the Bowden resolution when he moved it, but
since then the Syjvanite allegation— true or false—has be-
coine so very public that an enquiry is to be held. Sylvanite,
ridden by Ross, was notoriously said to have been pulled
in the interests of his stable companion, F.J.A., ridden
by Lewis, who won the race. Racing people don’t need
to be told that the allegation of dishonesty is always made
in such cases, and is usually unfounded. The strength
of tne suspicion in this instance is shown by the respect-
ful attention it has received. The owner of Sylvanite
appears to be very anxious to have the case gone into,
although he didn’t ask for an enquiry until after
Mr. Bowden had raised the dust. But the owner
is a matter of no importance whatever in many a
racing scandal. The accused person—wrongly accused
it may be—is jockey Ross, who may or may not be ac-
cused of acting in collusion with Bob Lewis, the other
principal jockey for Scobie’s stable. Jockeys and trainers
count for more than owners in Turf happenings. And
whilst the running of the Ballarat horses is being inves-
tigated—if it be seriously investigated—how about the
allegation that F. J.A. was “ stiff” for the race which he
didn t win on Oaks Day when Lewis rode him? Pre-
sumably the two allegations will be treated as component
parts of one story. Thusfar the yarn is not highly con-
vincing. Sylvanite has run like a beast of a horse on
half-a-dozen occasions when the stable expected him to
do better, and the race on Oaks day, which F.J.A. ought
to have won, was thrown into confusion at the finish by
the swerving of a nag that came in first, but was subse-
quently disqualified.

In one day lately, at Ascot (Melbourne) pony
meeting, two pony owners were summarily refused a cur-
tailment of recently-inflicted disqualification sentences ; a
winner was straightly informed that his habit of starting
two horses in one race for betting-controlling purposes
was a vile one and would have to be dropped ; the rider
of the second of these ponies was informed before the
race that if he didn’t do his level best something weighty
would drop ; another jockey, refused a license for asso-
ciating with bad characters, was given a trial for one
month on probation ; a third was cautioned for his poor
horsemanship ; and finally the stewards decided to refuse
the nomination of the pony Granny till her owner teaches
her to face the starting machine quietly. It was a hefty
afternoon’s work.

Isaac Noses had some tough figures to digest
after the Perth Cup meeting in the West —and his clients
had tougher. For a pound put on each of the six winners
Noses paid £33 13s. 4d. ; the same £6 put on the same six
horses through the tote would have brought in £72 9s.
In other words, backers had to accept a discount of about
60 per cent, for the honor and glory of putting their
money into Noses’ bag and taking their chance of the
bag leaking or flying over the fence before the last race
was finished.

A recent Broken Hill picnic race meeting was
graced with the presence of a nigger bookmaker. He was
an Afghan, and outshone all the rest of the sporting
fraternity in punctilio of dress. A magnificent headgear
was an oasis in the desert of Australian sameness. The
Barrier White Australians were liberal in their patronage,
and the dusky booky returned to town flush.

A Melbourne man, just returned from the
Perth (W. A.) Cup meeting, tells a good story of what
Nathan said unto Levy. There are two betting places at
Perth racecourse—the Paddock, where the bigger wagers
are laid, and the St. Leger reserve. Just before the start
of one of the minor events punter Nathan rushed from
the paddock and put his excited query to bookie Levy (of
the St. Leger): “What price Fifeness?” Levy’s price
was sto 2. “ Lay me 3to 1, and I’ll tell you something,”
pleaded the punter. “ Well, I’ll lay you £l5 to £5, and
how what have you got to tell me?” asked Levy.
Nathan, handing in his “ fiver ” and taking the ticket,
imparted the information that Fifeness had shortened to
6 to 4 in the Paddock.

Sydney Tatt.’s committee is chuckling over the
result of its refusal to, as usual, sell gate, race-book, and
other privileges in connection with the recent two days’
meeting at Randwick. These, it is said, panned out
something over £2ooo—considerably in excess of the
£750 rent, charged by the A.J.0., and exclusive of takings
(additional thousands) at paddock and Leger turnstiles.
The club only gave away £2350 in prize money, towards
which horse-owners contributed stiffly in entrance and
acceptance fees. Evidently Cohen has a big say in the
management.
Reckoned that current year’s tote-tax will add
between £12,000 and £14,000 to the Westralian revenue.
The recent big meeting at Perth put £2OOO into the
Treasury.

Entries for big things of A. J.C. autumn meeting
show improvement on last year’s. Doncaster Handicap

The chief sport on Saturday, as far as Sydney
was concerned, was on the water. No less than seven
races took place in Port Jackson, one in Botany Bay, and
the Royal Yacht Squadron sailed an ocean race, in which
the interest was rather damped by the third boat arriving
too late to take place in the start, while the two starters
were not anything like a match. A. J. Soutar’s 26-year-
old Oithona gave the Actea 30min. start in a race from
Neutral Bay to a spot a mile east of Botany Bay North
Head and back. Oithona rounded the mark 24min. ahead
of the Actea, and streaked home 42min. 29sec. ahead of
the newer but smaller boat. These old deep-keelers take
a lot of beating.
The boat that used to be known as Arline has
been re-christened Australian, and from the very jump
she led the Flying Squadron in the race for the 18ft.
championship. Being a championship race, it was, of
course, a scratch start. The 14 boats got going very
well, and looked very picturesque as they sailed down
the harbor together. The leader was in charge of Chris.
Webb, and that navigator had his work cut out, as his
topsail halyards jammed, and for a long while even
cold steel failed to rectify the trouble. The result was
that for a considerable portion of the time the boat could
not get on her extras. At Shark Island Donnelly
was a couple of seconds ahead, but Australian left
her hopelessly behind on the run to Clark Island. Arawa
turned turtle near the starter’s boat on the second round,
but, as it never had a hope anyhow, the act was super-
fluous. Webb’s Australian won easily, but hardly anyone
noticed it; all eyes were concentrated on the struggle
between the Zena and Donnelly for second place. The
boats seemed to be locked together, and as they forged
ahead a few inches alternately, from both following
steataers and scores of other craft went up roars and
cheers. Then the Zena made a little spurt, and finished
ahead by a fragment of a bumpkin. After that, the rain
swept down like a veil, and shut out everything. It was
like the curtain at a vast theatre, only no curtain ever
came down with such a rush.

.. Ever since 1899 the Prince Alfred Yacht Club
has been struggling for final possession of the Hordern
Cup, and on Saturday the utensil found a final resting
place on the sideboard of C. T. Brockhoff. This yachts-
man first won it in the Aoma in 1900. In 1901 he had to
pass it over to Mr. W. Marks, in the Isea, but managed to
regain it in 1902 with the Fleetwing. Then three others
took it for a year each, the last being Mr. A. W. Beach,
in the Cooya, in 1905. On Saturday Mr. Brockhoff won
it with Fleetwing for the third and last time, and will
now use it to make milk punch in on cold nights. The
winning yacht sailed beautifully on the dead thrash to
windward. Janet and Sunbeam were on Scratch, Magic
on the 2min. mark, Fleetwing 3min., and in front
of her three long markers. At Manly buoy Fleetwing had
gained nearly ten minutes on the limit boat, Kukuburra,
and was running third. At Quarantine Point, it had run
in to second place. At Shark Island Kukuburra, although
still leading, was slowly losing time. Fort Denison found
Kukuburra only 2min. 29sec. ahead, and as they beat
down the channel towards Bradley’s Head the Fleetwing
drew closer till at Watson’s Bay Pile Light the eventual
winner was in front with 65sec. to spare. Then Magic
began to draw up on the leaders, till they came close to
Carden Island when an angry southerly struck the
flotilla and a shower of rah: shut out the view. The race
finished in the midst of the deluge, Kukuburra and Magic
holding second and third places respectively.

If Donnelly were a horse instead of a
racing boat there would be talk of its remarkable
change of form. After a series of very indifferent
performances on Saturday the boat came with a
wonderful rush, and for a time looked all over a winner.
Eventually it ran into third place in a fleet of 14. The
display of ballooners was very fine, and without a doubt
boating on Sydney Harbor is one of the most picturesque
sports in the world.

Melbourne Swimming Club had a carnival at
Hegarty’s Baths, St. Kilda, Friday last, the attendance
being mostly girl. The Championship for boys under 16, dis-
tances 100yds. and 50yds., went to F. Beaurepaire, Albert
Park C., who won both events with yards to spare ; and
the greatly-improved F. Fitts crawled home first in the
100yds. Members’ Race. Most impressive event was a
50yds. Girls’ Race, contested by nine sparsely clad mer-
maids. The after effect was charming. Though they had
only the one chance to extend themselves in the water
these dripping forms were in evidence till Gorsave.
From a man’s point of view the evidence was irresistible.
ASTHMA.

Asthma is a most distressing complaint, and yet

The severity of the paroxysms depends more on
the condition of the stomach than anything else,
and it has been proved that by using Dr. Morse’s

“F.C.”: The Victorian swimming carnival, at

photo was committed in private, the other m public.
Perhaps the absence of a crowd constituted the olteii .

Messrs. Jones and Griffin put up a savage 10-
round scrap at Sydney Gaiety on Saturday mght.
Griffin’s chief stock-in-trade was a particularly virulent
species of uppercut. No matter what happened he
uppercut vigorously, sometimes with either hand, and
occasionally with both. A true and faithful account
would read something like this : Jones led to the jaw
with the left. Griffin uppercut. Jones banged both
mils to the ribs. Griffin uppercut. Jones landed three
on the mouth in succession. Griffin uppercut a couple,
which had a steadying effect. Jones crossed with his
right to the jaw. Griffin uppercut, and then went to the
floor. Griffin came up like an Indian-rubber ball and,
whirling round Jones, tried to uppercut him. Continual
upper-cutting began to make Jones dizzy. Only one ln
ten got home, but it was enough. By the 10th he was
exhausted, and unable to get out of the way of the uPP er *
cut, and was floored three times in succession, and then
his seconds, who were afraid the bottom of his face might
give way if it was uppercut any more, dropped the towel
of surrender.

Boy-of -the-bulldog-breed Hiam met Mr. ‘ ‘ Bob ”
Quigley, of Pyrmont, at Sydney National Sporting Club
on Tuesday evening' week, and the interview lasted the
whole 20 rounds to which such upheavals are limited. It
was a very straightforward slogging match, and although
there was much wild shouting on the part of barrackers,
:t was hardly justifiable. Hiam forgot that the British
tar has won all his fights by rushing in and dealing
out sudden death at close quarters, and for the major
portion of the fight he stood off and tried long range
lighting with a more skilful man than himself. The
result was disastrous from the “points” side of the
question, and Hiam got left badl}'. Occasionally he
would rush and hustle Quigley, but, as a rule, the Pyr-
mont gentleman was not incommoded by having to
endure heavy battering, and plenty of it, at close
quarters. Had Hiam boarded his enemy, so to speak, it
is doubtful if Mr. Referee Beckett would have had to
announce that Mr. Quigley was winner “ on points.”
A Melbourne teacher of pugilism announces
in his advt. that he will visit pupils at their own houses
or impart proficiency in his “ studio.” The noble art!

Maoriland chess championship has again re-
verted to R. J. Barnes, of Wellington, who won the title
previously in 1890, 1896, 1897 and 1901. The final was a
fine tussle between Mason and Barnes, but the think-
power of the many-times champion prevailed,
* * * *
An Englishman named Jefferson, being con-
sumed with a desire to do something not yet accom-
plished by any other man, recently drove a motor-car
from Coventry in England to Constantinople. When the
car reached the Servian frontier the fun began, for at
that point real roads ceased and gave way to bush tracks
compared to which the Melbourne-Sydnev road is a per-
fect Appian Way. The car was an 8 h.p. single cylinder
Rover, and was, of course, fitted with Dunlop tyres, and
the only trouble experienced was the puncturing of an
inner tube by a spike in the environs of Adrianople.
Jefferson crossed Servia and Bulgaria without any guards,
and when bandits tried to stick him up he simply ran
away from them, although they mostly ran away from
him. Oil the frontier of Macedonia, however, the Turkish
Government insisted on supplying a military guard, the
presence of which nearly cost Jefferson his life on more
than one occasion. Jefferson had previously made some
astounding rides on a Dunlop tyred bicycle, having jour-
neyed from London to Moscow (Russia), Irkutsk (Siberia),
and Khiva (Turkestan).*
A pressman writes :
Allow me, as one closely conversant with the subject,
to protest against a series of statements contained in a
paragraph in last week’s Bulletin re the Williamstown
rifle matches held last October. It is asserted that. *
“There is a pother among the pot-hunters from the
various States over the system of marking at the
Williamstown (Vic.) rifle range. It is based mainly on
the fact that any outsider can ring up the markers at the
long-distance targets on the telephone, a thing unknown
elsewhere. More than hints have been thrown out that
he who wants top score must square the marker, and that
the ’phone is often found handy to let the marker know
where the man who paid for a top score is shooting.
Comment is made on the fact that in the shooting for
the Governor-General's cup Westralia beat Victoria by
an unexpected surplus, amid loud cheering from the
other end of the range.”
“ Various States ”is incorrect; N.S.W. is the only State
that has made any fuss. No “ outsider ” dare approach
the telephones, which are in charge of non-commissioned
officers at each end, but only the responsible range officers
may communicate with the trenches. Even the ranger
had his private telephone disconnected. Not a single
instance of “squaring the marker” can be proved.
The marker never handles the telephone. ihe
Westralians could have won any prize at the meet-
ing, and were “tipped” by competent judges to
win even the Commonwealth Match, which was
much more important than the Governor’s Cup.
With regard to the term “ pot-hunters.” The average
rifleman is anything but a capitalist. To attend the
rifle matches he must forfeit, as a rule, his week s wages,
in addition to paying his railway fare and entries, which
might run to anything up to £5. His total expenses for
six or seven days amount to perhaps £lo—saved, prob-
ably, by the most drastic economy. Few—very few—
of the competitors make expenses, let alone capture
“ pots ” He must shoot well who can take £l5 back
home—and, after all, the £l5 is offered to make men
shoot well. If every man in Australia could be made to
putin good practice at 600yds. every time he tried, at an
expense of £l5, the money would be well spent.
Referring to the other matters, the facts of the case are
these. A N.S.W. marksman is said to have stated to the
chairman of the National Association that he had been
approached by a man in the final of the King s, who
offered for £2 —“ one for himself and one for his mate
to get him a possible or a 49. He mentioned this fact
exactly two months after the meeting closed. Like the
case of the capitalist who is always going to
establish the post-hole industry at enormous expense,
no names were mentioned, of course. The JN.S. YV.
Association councillors then got swapping yarns, and each
“ had heard someone say that someone else had been told
that someone else,” and so on and so on. No charge was
laid, and the only evidence to go on was the general
statement of an unnamed individual, who had made him-
self liable to disqualification for life and deprivation of
all his prizes by not at once reporting an attempt at
fraud. , .
All evidence points to the fact that the marksman re-
ferred to was selected as the most likely victim of a very
simple form of confidence ” trick. In all matches at
Williamstown the markers were moved from target to
target and group to group at irregular intervals. They
were in charge of an experienced non-commissioned
officer who guarded the telephone. The competitors
themselves did not know at which target they were to
shoot or their order of firing, until a few minutes before-
hand.’ Each group of 10 targets was supervised by an
experienced range officer. In the final of the King s,
where the alleged fraud is supposed to have been at-
tempted, these precautions were doubled. Two men
worked each target, two men guarded the telephones.
By the time the £2 had been split up amongst all in-
terested there would not have been enough left to buy
even one long beer. Only three NS W men figured in
the final:—F. Le Maitre (third), W. H. Cutler (seventh),
and H J F. Neale (21st). Which of these, if any, was
approached as a soft thing for the confidence trick all rifle-
men are anxious to know. The V.R.A., for the purpose of
rule 33 (sub-sec. b), which reads : “ Any competitor who,
being cognisant of any attempt to defraud,” &c., is also
awaiting”developments. The nasty insinuation that the
Westralians won the Governor’s Cup through changing
places with Victoria is beneath contempt. Capt. Eales’
team was composed of marksmen capable, with average
luck of winning the best prizes at the meeting. Their
victory was the most popular of the gathering. The in-
sinuations of a few jealous individuals, who didn’t win
themselves, made too late for inquiry, must be very dis-
tressing to the little band of Western marksmen, who
proved themselves thorough sportsmen throughout. But
the matter is not worth worrying about. People in other
States only smile and say, “ New South Wales again.”
Chemist Park, who lately died in Sydney
after many years residence, claimed to be
descended from explorer Mungo Park. Joseph
Banks’ correspondence states that Mungo, over a
century ago, wanted badly to explore Australia, and
offered his services to the British Government for
10s. a day ; but notwithstanding that “ his moral
character was unblemished, his temper mild, and
his patience inexhaustible,” a deal could not be
brought about. Perhaps the British Government
wanted an explorer who would explore 12 hours a
day for 9d. an hour.
The big motor meeting at Aspendale Park, near
Mordialloe (Vic,), will definitely take place on January
29th, A.N.A. Day. The track, which was laid down by
Mr. Crooke at a'cost of £l5OO, is now in first-class con-
dition, and as it is properly banked and the surface ideal,
some very fast times are certain to be put up. After a
parade of handsome cars there will be eight races for cars
and three for motor-bikes. The principal car event will
be the Five-Mile contest for the Crooke Cup, valued at
100 guineas ; a Five-Mile Invitation Race, and the Motor-
cycle Derby. Some of the wheelers have provided high-
powered bikes for the occasion, and when they are let out
for all they are worth some tall travelling is confidently
expected. Railway boss Tait is running special trains,
and if the A.N.A. is thoughtful enough to arrange for
fine weather an ideal afternoon’s sport should result.*
G. H. Mott, journalist, who lately died at
Kew (Vic.), was remarkable as the founder of the
old Victorian Anti-Customs League. The early
question of inter-State Free trade was a tangled
one. Away back in 1855 N.S.W. and Victoria
had practically the same tariff, and it was agreed
in that year, on the demand of N.S.W., that
border duties should be abolished along the
Murray. N.S.W. broke away from this agree-
ment in ’64. In 1865 inter-State Freetrade was
again started on the Murray, but N.S.W. only
joined in on condition that Victoria paid it
£60,000 a year as a bonus. When this agreement
expired N.S.W. demanded a still larger subsidy,
and finally, in ’73, the Ma State abolished the so-
called ‘‘ uniform tariff ” and broke away for good,
and then there was nothing left of the work of G.
H. Mott and his Anti-Customs League.
Bridge and Poker players who are having a bad
run at cards should drop them for a night or two and
have a try at the Dunlop Design Competition. The latter
is almost as interesting as a game of cards and is
certainly cheaper ; besides, you may win £35, £lO, £5. All
you have to do is place a of pictorial designs in
order of merit from your point of view. Booklets free

Melbourne Board of Works has long been
noted for its arbitrary attitude to its employees.
A short time ago, Edward Seitz, draughtsman
under the Board, invented a new kind of fluid
valve. He took out a provisional patent, and
assigned his rights to a big engineering firm, with
the stipulation that the Board of Works should
have free use of the patent in perpetuity. The
Board was asked to approve of his action, and to
agree not to oppose the granting of a patent to
Seitz or his assignees. Commissioner Gahan, m
opposing the motion, said that an officer should
not be encouraged to do such work. It would be
better, if a man showed superior ability, to give
him a bonus or increase his salary ; but the Board
had purchased his brains, and he was not entitled
to use them for private work. The motion to
accept Seitz’s proposal was defeated by nine votes
to five—an illiberal, not to say tyrannical, deci-
sion.
“ Caber’s ” reminiscences :
Hugh M. Nelson (just deceased) was a good fellow, but
not much on politics. Coming to Queensland in 1853 he
spent a couple of years on his father’s (Dr. Nelson s)
station, Sartha (since wiped off the map by the prickly
pear) In the sixties he managed Eton Vale for his
brother-in-law, Johnnie Watts, first member for Drayton
and Toowoomba. The firm was then Hodgson and Watts,
and when Robert Ramsay bought Watts out in 1871, Nelson
took up a part of the resumed portion of- St. Ruth—the
worst part, of course, and named it Loudoun, after the
picturesque woods in his native country, Ayr. When the
electorate of Murilla was formed out of that region ranging
from Mount Hutton to Oallandoon—some 700 miles
across—he was elected for the constituency,
he represented it until his elevation to the Fossils,
some five years ago. In 1892, when Glassey and
Hoolan formed the Opposition, the unholy alliance
placed Nelson in charge of a dozen or so hardshells to
oppose the alliance and give tone to the scramble for the
loaves and fishes. Remember reporting him at Callan-
doon where he told the manager, two jackaroos, a
friendly auctioneer from the neighboring township, and
myself, that he was going to move a vote of censure on
the Ministry, and remember reading a fortnight later that
he had joined that Ministry as Treasurer. When the
banks toppled over in ’93, and the Q.N.B. impounded all
the Government funds, Nelson set to work to take the
kinks out of things in general. He let the bank keep the
cash —it’s got the biggest part of it still —and cut down
salaries 10 per cent. Everybody who was not drawing a
Government salary voted that financing of a high order,
but it seemed quite simple at the time. However, as a
man, Hugh Nelson ranked high, and it will be as the
genial laird of Loudoun and Gabbinbar, and not as
the Premier and Treasurer of Queensland, that he will be
remembered in the years to come.
Mother Seigel in Sydney.
A Sufferer from Heartburn, Flatulency,
and Indigestion Cured by Mother Seigel’s
Syrup.
A clear, cool, logical mind is only possible when
the stomach is in a healthy condition. With the
digestive functions deranged, the whole system
becomes out of order at once, and the working
powers of both body and mind fall below their
usual standard. , _ , .
Mr Joseph F. Pitcher, of 137, Crown-street,
Wooloomooloo, Sydney, N.S.W., is one of many
people who have learned, this truth from paintui
experience. A professional accountant, accus-
tomed to accuracy, to precision, Mr. Pitcher
describes his case with great clearness. It was
in 1898,” he says, in a letter dated 4th May, 1905,
“that my health became seriously impaired by
chronic indigestion or dyspepsia. My appetite
ceased, and the little food I partook of I ate only
by sheer force of will. It had no attraction what-
ever for me, neither did I get nourishment from
it. On the contrary it seemed to form into a hard
mass at the pit of my stomach, and to remain
there for hours after I had dined, producing very
uncomfortable sensations, and sometimes acute
pain. Of course this was very weakening; but
when to it was added heartburn and flatulency, I
lost flesh rapidly, and my condition became
serious. . ,
“ I tried many specifics for my complaint that
were recommended to me by friends, but they
one and all proved useless. However, during the
Christmas season of 1902 I chanced to read an
advertisement of Mother Seigel’s Curative Syrup,
which impressed me so much that I was induced
to try what that medicine could do for me. When
I had been taking it for only a few days, I began
to experience some slight relief. In less than a
month there was a decided change for the better
in my condition, which convinced me that I had
found a real remedy at last. My appetite re-
turned, and I was no longer troubled with pain
after eating. The heartburn and flatulency ceased,
and I was wonderfully invigorated in every
respect. It took only four larg - bottles of Mother
Seigel’s Curative Syrup to affect a complete trans-
formation in my health ! I have coihmued to be
well ever since.”*
Some reminiscences from the Oldest In-
habitant :
The week’s N.S.W. obituary contains the name of Mrs.
Mary MTntosh, relict of Mr. Charles MTntosh, of Den-
bigh, Cobbitty, aged 87 years. Denbigh is a place historic
in the State. Some 75 years ago the house, which is still
standing, was built by a new arrival, who took up the
splendid land adjoining and fortified the place against
bushrangers, and lived there in great alarm for many
years. He died there, and the property was purchased
by Rev. Thomas Hassall, son of Rowland Hassall of the
very early days. Mr. Hassall was the colonial chaplain
of the locality, and had built for him in 1840 St. Paul’s,
Cobbitty—or, as the native pronunciation is, Cobbodee—
about two miles from Denbigh. Parson Hassall died in
1868, and MTntosh succeeded him, and was succeeded in
turn by his three sons, who have further bloated out the
big estate. Cobbitty churchyard contains the bones of
many grasping old pioneers. The wife of Charles Cowpei
lies there; also the Hassalls, John Norton Oxley, Bosan-
nuet of Mollermain, Doctor John Cash Neild (father of
the Senator), the Wilds of Vauderville, and many others.
A wife speaks, in the police courts, about
the happy home at Malvern (Vic.)
My husband on one occasion came home drunk. He
had a bottle of gin, which I took away while he slept;
and on waking he struck at me. He tore the lining
boards down and chased me. On another occasion he
threw a saucepan at me. He also threw a leg of mutton
at the stove, and nearly struck the baby. lam Hunter s
second wife. He has seven other children, and that
caused the difference between us. He always sided with
his first wife’s children. His daughter, Mary, aged 14,
quarrelled with me. She spat on her hands and invited
me to come on. Hunter laughed, and said : Good on
you, Mary ; hold up your traditions.”
Hubby, who is a returned S’African warrior, re-
marked that he took gin for the good of Ins
kidneys; that he couldn’t afford to get drunk
often : and that he was the father of 12 children.
When there are 12 children in a crowded suburban
house the butcher’s meat can hardly be thrown
about without hitting one baby or another. And
the wife who takes away the gin that a returned
warrior can afford only once in a while need not
be surprised if a whole dead sheep is thrown .it
her.

The Queensland Tory says there is no
need for an arbitration law in his State, because
there are no industrial disputes worth men-
tioning these times. But there is a vast quantity
of sweating in Brisbane, especially in the clothing
trade. • Sydney is a great market for the sweated
products, because the Court’s awards have rendered
sweating less possible in N.S.W. than formerly.
Une factory in Brisbane, where scores of girls are
employed at from 2s. 6d. per week up to a trifle
more, is fully occupied turning out sweated goods
at a price which is like the sale of flesh and blood.
Uther factories are joining in the wretched busi-
ness. it is time the Australian Parliament got
power by an amendment of the Constitution, to
make factory laws for all Australia.

while an Australian rector would be regarded as a
fool if he so burdened himself .
“Eor scrupulous honesty, for hdgetty
rectitude in money matters,” said the rent-collec-
tor “yoil can’t beat a lone elderly spinster who
has cultivated the habit of living Within a small
income. One of my best ‘ pays for years was an
old lady living by herself m a house at the north
etld Melbourne. When I first
Used to go for her rent, I had sometimes to make
two or three calls before I found her at home, and
this worried her a lot. So she told me that for
the future she would never leave the house with-
out putting the rent in ah envelope under the
pillow of her virgin couch, and the front-door key
Under the door-mat. I was to enter the house on
mv own, go to her bedroom, take the rent, and
leave the rent book, duly signed, on the counter-
pane. As a rule, I did find her out, and then
I helped myself to the rent. She never
forgot to leave it. I think she must have
slept with the money always under the
pillow, ready fot my next collection. Well, one
day, I couldn’t get into the house. No answer to
mV knocks, and nO key under the doormat.
Called again next day, and learned from the
neighbors that my old lady had not been seen of
late. The end of it was that the police came and
forced a side window, and found the tenant in
b e d—dead. I hurried off to tell the landlord
there was one of his houses to let, with a week s
rent owing, and he had so much to say about my
letting a tenant die in arrears that I returned to
the house to see whether the old girl had made
any special arrangements for settling her out-
standing accounts. Just then, the police were
taking the body away. I stepped quietly into
the bedroom, lifted up the corner of the pillow
and sure enough there was the rent, with the
book, as usual.”

TESTIMONIES. Mr. F. C. PAINE, of Winton, Queensland, writes:—
“Just a few lines to let you know how I am progressing. Able to inform you that I am quite myself
again ; I have never felt better, and have quite recovered from my complaint."
Mr. T. R. R , of Swan Bay, writes
“ A line to tell you that I have received your letter and parcels of remedies, and I must say that the action
of my heart has improved wonderfully from their use, and I feel certain I will be quite well again soon."
Mr. JOSEPH BLAIR, of Terang, Victoria, writes :
“I am extremely grateful for the good your skill has done for me. You are the first Medical Men who
know anything of my complaint. My dealings with you satisfy me of your skill as Specialists.”
These are only a few of scores that we receive continuously.

‘‘ Hinhen’s ” tale of sin :
* ’
George sat in the Fitzroy Gardens on Saturday night
JS* !j« r 0 i" 'thing for the big
race and’in P his soul was a vast yearning to" get to the
Austral final. But how to get rid of her?
“Why are you so quiet, dear ?’’stw asked. _
Then, as he expressed it afte v,is brain P to work.”
“ BfcosTshouldnTbe here with you,” he said.
“W-why?” inquired the her.
“Becos,” said George sadly and dramatically, “becos
I’m married.” ,
Straightway the lady rose told what s ie
never to speak to her again so long as he lived, etc.
He put her on a tram” dashed into a cab, and drove to
the Austral, patting his brain on its hack for its astute-
ness. He arrived just in time to put his £3 on the good
thing—Levey—who won. roller!-
Levey was disqualified, and
the race given to Sandberg, a wild figure was seen rushing
round the track, frothing at the mouth, and shrieking for
someone to come and amputate its brain.
“U.” : I was nearly “converted” the
other day. A sanctimonious-looking man handed
me a tract containing a story concerning “the
great forests of Australia, where many men are
engaged in the timber trade,” and another about
“ a young man leaning on the counter of an hotel
in Prahran, a suburb of Melbourne, eating his
lunch and drinking a glass of ale.” There were
many brimstone threats, but the final appeal wa3
very touching:—
I rushed after the tract-distributor to consult him
on this point, but on the way I noticed the im-
print on the tract —'“John Ellis, printer. Bridle-
smith Gate, Nottingham.” Further examination
showed that “ the forests of Australia ” had prob-
ably served formerly as “ the backwoods of Califor-
nia, ” and that Prahran was most likely substituted
for Seven Dials or Tooting Bee. With bitter
remembrance of experience as an out-of-work com-
positor. I expressed a hope that the inhabitants of
the place where I would spend eternity (if any)
would not import everything, even to their tracts
and their parsons. I tried to explain my view-
point to the tract man the next time I saw him
but he simply said my words were outrageous, and
handed a leaflet on “ The Bread of Life ” to a
starved looking woman who tottered past.
In N.S. Wales bankruptcies for the year
just expired laborers head the list with 52 cases.
Miners come next with 44. Hotel-keepers num-
ber 28, and farmers 16. There were 13 civil ser-
vants, and 13 clerks. Amongst the units were a
parson, a newspaper proprietor, and a barrister.
N.S.W. Public Service Board has decreed
that the messengers in the Public Service shall
wear uniforms henceforth, the cost to be charged
to the State. This will be welcomed by the older
class of messenger, who will be glad enough of the
free clothes. But the young generation is rebelling
vigorously. Quite 80 per cent, of the messenger
. class hope one day to qualify under the Board’s
regulations for transfer to the clerical division of
the service, and they fear that they will, in the
event of success in their examinations, never be
able to live down the livery of their messenger*
life. There is no reason given for the step, except
the snobbish one that the messengers l.ot
uniformed can’t be distinguished from the Public
Service clerks, which seems a mighty poor
cause for this expensive “reform.” The old
difficulty of distinguishing between guest and
waiter in evening dress is one of London Punch’s
steady sources of income, but no one has thought
it necessary to have that dress altered.
Where will you spend Eternity ?
Don’t say X cannot tell.
Where will you spend Eternity ?

Dr. Sheldon’s New Discovery
For Coughs, Colds and Consumption.
Of all the new discoveries in medical science, the most remarkable in recent years is one
which will prove invaluable to thousands of people, and which it is believed will take
the place of all other remedies for the cure of Coughs, Colds and Consumption. The
preparation is called Dr. Sheldon’s New Discovery for Coughs, Colds and
Consumption, and is a scientific compound of great merit. It is most healing to the
lungs and throat, and cures the cough or cold in a remarkably short time, leaving no bad
after effects. As it contains no injurious drugs of any kind, it is a perfectly safe remedy
for children, and is particularly good for croup and whooping cough. The dose is small
and it is pleasant to take.

SUFFERED FROM BLEEDING LUNGS FQR
EIGHTEEN MONTHS, BUT MADE WELL BY
DR. SHELDON’S
NEW DISCOVERY.
A grateful woman writes the following letter to the
proprietors of this wonderful remedy :
Geelong, Vic., July 12,1905.
Sheldon Drug Company.
Dear Sirs, —I had suffered for eighteen months with
bleeding of the lungs, and was given up by my
physician, who said I could not live longer than two
days. My lungs were bad, bleeding daily; also I
suffered terribly with pains in the back and swellings.
I saw your advertisement in the paper for Dr.
Sheldon’s Sew Discovery for Coughs, Colds and
Consumption, and procured a bottle from Mr. Nash,
the grocer. It helped me at once, and now I am en-
tirely cured. My lungs are as strong as anyone’s, and
I have never had any bleeding since; in fact, 1 feel
like a new person.
I have also given Dr. Sheldon’s New Discovery to
my children at various times, and I have never had
anything from either doctors or chemists which has
done me and mine the same good. I can recommend
Dr. Sheldon’s New Discovery to all those suffering
from colds or consumption, as in my case.
Very gratefully yours,
49 Butamen St., Geelong. Mrs. Elizabeth Peterson.

A little syndicate consisting- of four penmen has put its
coin and its brains into a new Adelaide threepenny weekly,
the Gadfly ; and the Ply is due to buzz about 'the time
this is printed. The new paper will be radical, “ white,"
and as smart as the four bright pens of the owners can
make it; and the proprietary pens are getting consider-
able help, besides, from a number of sympathetic nibs in
Melbourne and S. Aus.

Alas, Perth Morning Herald, which only 12 months
ago decided that it wouldn’t report race meetings and
such sinful things, had a leader on Dec. 28th on “ The
Perth Cup.” With one eye on its subscribers’ lists and
the other on the ink-pot, it wrote sorrowfully—“ Man still
clings to the primal instinct, and holds by the horse.”
Daily papers, it seems, “cling to the primal instinct," too.
their “ primal instinct ” being subscribers.

Editor Reay, of Melbourne Herald, has been taken in,
and has left for the Cold Country. During his absence,
the job of editing the Herald will be carried on by
J. P. Davidson, editor of the Weekly Times and late of
Melbourne Argus, and Percy Reay, sub-editor of the
Herald, who are to reign conjointly, like the two kings
of Barataria.
* • • *
Kate Field, an American journalist, once asked
novelist Charles Reade for his autograph. She got it
thus : “ Damn autographs.— Charles Reade ”
• * * •
“Russian Unrest” was the mild little head line that
Melbourne Argus used recently to describe the condition
of affairs in the half-Tartar empire. The items that day
included (1) a battle with an army of 4000 rebels •
(2) an estimate of 20,000 lives lost in Moscow; (3) the’
shelling of an almshouse, with the killing of eight old
women ; (4) the running by revolutionaries of an empty
train full tilt against a train-load of returned soldiers.
Certainly this seemed a little unrestful.
• * • *
Worthy of note, the large number of politicians in
Bananaland who are identified with newspapers. One
man owns seven. He is a veritable rag-planter. ' Typed
copies of one leader do the lot. They are mostly boosting
Philp and “Janny,” or crying “Secesh.” The matrices
of articles appearing in Brisbane dailies are obtained and
stereos, made for distribution. Tory literature thus gets
a good start. Each of the three dailies in Brisbane has a
director in the House of Fossils, and with unabashed in-
decency they oppose everything likely to deplete the
revenue from the festive ad.
* * « •
“ O Pipp ” 1 Alas ! that good old daily-paper institu-
tion, the silly season, is gradually being monopolised by
self-advertising politicians. What a record of stifled
“Pro Bono Publico” and “Subscriber for 75 Years”
could be cited against Carruthers, Reid, and the rest of
them 1 “ The Locust Pest ’’ gives way to “ Mr. Car-
ruthers Again " ; “ The Cursing Clauses of the Athan-
asian Creed" are replaced by “Mr. Carruthers on Fede-
ration ” ; many columns of “Do Bot-flies Sting ? ” and
“ The Cockroach Nuisance " are bumped out in favor of
a slab of “Mr. Carruthers Once More.” Then there is
the Reid-Deakin argument as to whether Mr. Reid is ‘ ‘ vacu-
ous and insincere ” or only vacuous, which takes the place
of such burning questions as “ Will the Worm Turn ? ” and
“ What is a Perfect Lady ? ’’—not to speak of “The Decay
of the Grampus.” Reid—Deakin—Carruthers 1 Who
are they, anyway* that their frenzied outpourings should
take the place of honest “Paterfamilias” and “BisDat
Qui Cito Dat ”on “ The Twelve Worst J.P.’s ” and “ The
Pun as an Art-form ” 1 If the proprietors of the dailies
only thought the matter out they would see that their
silly-season circulation must go down if this policy of
correspondent-suppression is continued. You don’t catch
a politician buying three dozen copies of the issue of the
Argus or the S.M. Herald containing his latest lucubra-
tion, and posting them to relatives and friends. When
some mute, inglorious “Fiat Justitia” or “Dismayed
Citizen ” dies from suppression of correspondence, per-
naps the editorial conscience will be smitten into a realis-
ation of the truth of the foregoing statements.

Longman’s Magazine quietly died with last October
number, at the early age of 24. As Glasgow Evening
News says, it was “ trampled to death under the hoofs of
the public which is rushing to the bookstalls and book-
shops to buy, at fourpence ha’penny, some inane budget
of amateur short tales of adventure, actress’s photographs,
belated and misplaced newspaper articles, and a dreadful
seasoning of bad drawings and photo-process repro-
ductions."
* * • ■»
Editor Reay, of Melbourne Herald* when he is at
home, conducts his office on strictly military lines
Everybody calls Reay “Kernal.” One of the most
important functionaries in the office is the small
boy who attends the Kernal to run messages
and be generally useful. Like the rest of the
Herald message boys, he wears a costume specially
designed by the Kernal—a cross between a Salvation
Army captain’s uniform and that of Ichabod Bronsoh in
“ The Belle of New York.” When he is doing nothing,
the boy, who is known in the office as “ the Kernal’s
orderly ”, stands behind Reay’s editorial chair at atten-
tion, until the commander-in-chief of the Herald says
“ Mump, mump”, or some such military formula. Then
the kid advances two steps, salutes, and makes a half-left
turn. Reay gives his order ; there is another salute ; the
boy turns right-about stiffly and marches out of the office.
As yet there is no brass band to strike up whenever the
march starts, but it is understood that the directors are
considering the matter. The military stiffness and pre-
cision of the Herald office to-day is in striking contrast
to the unconventional and breezy manner in which it
was run when old Sam Winter managed it by the aid of
bard work and blanky.
There’s a Quilpish editor in Australia who pjayed a
cruel joke, the other day, on a trusting lady contributor.
The said lady, urged thereto by editor Quilp, wrote severe
things about the females of her parish who went to the
races in gorgeous but unpaid-for raiment. The next week
appeared a stinging, anonymous letter purporting to
come from one of the females aforesaid, in which the
writer was mercilessly dissected. She went in tears to
the editor to ask why this cruelty had been allowed, and
he comforted her, and told her that that was the way to
Fame with a big “ F,” and that she had better reply to
her detractor. And for some weeks she carried on an un-
equal warfare in the “ Correspondence ” columns, finding
herself no match in claws for her antagonist. Then she
found that the other party to the correspondence was—
editor Quilp.
THE SONG OF THE SCRIBE.
[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
When hours that follow shams and shows have eaten half
the night,
And the “ bobby ” can’t be found upon his beat;
When the last late pub. has had to close, and Vice slinks
out o’ sight,
The gay reporter gent comes up the street.
You may tell him when you meet him by the smile he
hasn’t got,
As the humor of his mouth sets hard and grim.
He is striding home in freedom to his unfamiliar cot. . . .
He feels the world is very good to him.
He started work at 10 a.m., and tore along till one,
Then had a snack and rushed things up till five ;
Saw the wife and bairns (and spoke to them !), the glad
day’s work half done,
And he knew how good it was to be alive.
After tea he took some facts by ’phone about the price of
glue,
Did a lecture on a strange disease in sheep,
Wrote some pars on Early Closing, and (though yet ’tis
barely two)
He’s permitted to go home and go to sleep 1
Oh, ’tis good to mark how Labor’s foes are falling left and
right—
To hear the fatted sweater wheeze and squeak ;
And it’s grand (the pale reporter knows) to work with
main and might,
Under pressure, say a hundred hours a week !
So he strides along delighted (four pounds weekly 1 think
o’ that!),
And his eyelids they are tremulous and red ;
He s the bulwark of the nation, and the pampered slave of
Fat,
And—he’s dreadfully content to get to bed.

THE PILLS
have gained their wonderful reputation by sheer force
of merit, because every person who uses them
recommends them to others. They have positively
no equal for thoroughly cleansing the system and
putting the liver and kidneys in functional order,
without pain or griping. They are the best known
remedy for Indigestion, Biliousness, Headache,
Dizziness, and the common condition of ill-health
known as “run-down ” or “out of sorts.” Females
of every age find Holloway’s Pills an invaluable
remedy and aid.
THE OINTMENT
Is known throughout the world as positively the
best and quickest remedy for Bad Legs, Old
Wounds and Sores, and Skin Eruptions of every
kind, and should be used in conjunction with the
Fills. It is also the speediest remedy for Rheu-
matism, Lumbago, Pains and Stiffness in the
Limbs and Joints, Backache, etc. For pains and
Soreness at the Chest, and for Throat and Lung
Complaints arising from Cold or Weakness,
Holloway’s Ointment affords mo®‘ welcome relief
in a very short time.

Benger’s Food has attained
its great reputation not by
extravagant or sensational
advertisement, but by the con-
stant recommendation of those
who have used it, and of Medi-
cal men who know its value.”
A Fitzroy (Melb.) man, with a long list of
“ priors/’earnes ly besought the bench lately to
forgive his lapse into liquor on the ground that he
had been strictly sober for two years. The sym-
pathetic bealts were about to comply, when a soul-
less sergeant casually remarked that the gentleman
had been kept sober in Pentridge Gaol for the
past two years. His cheek deserved better luck.
His Majesty’s ironclad Pyramus has ar-
rived. Its boilers gave out to some extent in the
Mediterranean soon after it left England. They
collapsed again in the Red Sea, where the bones
of the Egyptians of Exodus are, and the Pyramus
was towed 500 miles. It was repaired, and gave
a concert at Perim. Then it came to grief again,
and it. took 16 days to further patch its innards at
Batavia. After that it came down the Queens-
land coast under difficulties, but at Hope Island
the officers had some good pigeon shooting. Alto-
gether his Majesty’s ironclad spent four months
in crawling out from England, but the concert
and the shooting seem to have been quite satis-
factory.
“F.C.”: After a careful perusal of Genesis,
I am persuaded that the story of the serpent and
the apple is a myth, and that Adam and Eve
were really driven out of the Garden of Eden by
the advancing tide of Socialistic legislation.
The recent rise in the price of leather,
which threatens to raise the price of footwear,
moved an infuriated Freetrader all the way from
Tingha (N.S.W.) to address the Sydney Tele-
graph thusly : ...
Sir,—We have given this industry 25 to 50 per cent,
duty, and to that they are adding another 25 per cent, or
so. Is this one of the blessings of Protection ? If so, let
us remit the duty as the internal price rises, so that we
may keep this octopus in check. At. present, the quality
is inferior. We pay here in Tingha 9s. 6d. for barium-
la/bn boots that last a month in the water, and the effect
of the chemical on the feet is remarkable.
Apart from the fact that it is the insane haste of
Australia to export its hides which is the cause
of the rise in leather, why does this man from
lingha want to. stand in water for a whole month
in a pair of nine-and-sixpenny boots? Is he an
alligator ?
A few statements from Australia To-Day
just published by the Commercial Traveller :
N.S.W. is the most healthy country in the world for
man and beast. In the large wheat districts, where
holders cultivate up to 10,000 acres, the horses are
hardly ever stabled. Six to eight crops of lucerne
are cut off the same land every year on the Hunter
River. Twenty million acres of flirt-class wheat
land, but only two cultivated. The sheep is a
money-spinning animal. One N.S.W. property
with 100,000 sheep is worth £250,000. Best beef
country is on the Upper Hunter, on the
eastern slopes of the Great Dividing Range
and Monaro. Nearly 13,000,000 acres of land
are available for occupation in Victoria.
Including indentations, Queensland has a
magnificent stretch of coastline for about 3000
miles, pierced by numerous bays, harbors, and
other inlets, into most of which flow navigable
rivers ; the best harbors are the least used, such as
Port Curtis, Bowen, and Cairns. Nature provided
snlendid harbors. Queensland preferred to dig
them out. .. South Australia produces the finest
fruit in the world.

Life’s happinesS
CAN ONLY BE OBTAINED by having a supply of Nerve Force and
Vitality in your body—the amount of Natural Electricity it contains.
Take the sap from a tree, what is the result? —It withers! Drain the
Vital Nerve Force from your system —which is the sap of life—what
do you become?—A Miserable, Puny Weakling, unfit alike for toil or
pleasure. You lose all energy and ambition in life ; your face becomes
drawn and hagged; you get irritable and restless; and you awake
each morning with the same tired feeling; truly a miserable existence.
You must always remain in that condition unless you have the amount
of Electricity you have lost replaced, and which must be injected by
means of gentle-flowing currents for a few hours each day. There is
only one appliance on earth to give it to you the in way it should be.
dr. McLaughlin’S electric belt
Forces the Electricity into every part of the body without shock or the
slightest inconvenience to the wearer. Each day you wear it you feel
vourself getting stronger in every way. ... If you suffer, IVrite
for our Book , which will show and explain this treatment to you,
and tells you the many ailments it cures, which we cannot do in a
public Advertisement. Many men and women—in every walk of life-
praise it for the great benefits they have received.
Mr. M. N. HAVARD. of Boupke, N.S.W., who suffered
from Nervo-Vital Weakness and Rheumatism, writes:
“ sirs,—l cannot cease praising your marvellous Belt for its wonderful cura-
tive powers ; it is a God-send to Australasia—it was to me at all events. The
benefit it has imparted to my system compels me to acknowledge to the
world its proficiency as a cure for auy complaint. It has undoubtedly saved
me from an untimely grave. No tongue can express sufficient words in its
praise. You are at liberty to use this statement as you wish, and any inform-
ation as to the above will be gladly imparted.”

For further information as to the value of this Great Remedy, we
publish a Grand, 96-Page, Illustrated Book, which deals exhaustively

WHAT IS CATARRH?
MEDICATOR.
dsf
Catarrh is inflammation of
the lining membrane of the
nose and adjoining passages.
If this inflammation is not
arrested it invades the pas-
sages which lead from the
nose to the head, ears, throat
and lungs. It injures the
sight and hearing, destroys
(he sense of taste and smell,
renders the breath offensive,
breaks down the affected tis-
sues, nasal car-
tileges, and rots away the
small • frontal bones of the
skull. The discharge, passing
through the lungs and sto-
mach, causes dyspepsia, also
consumption. Do you want
relief and cure? If so, try

the result that it completely cured me, and I am per-

BRONCHITIS.
A SUFFERER FOR YEARS CURED BY ONE BOTTLE
OF HEARNE’S BRONCHITIS CURE.
NO OTHER TREATMENT DID ANY GOOD.
Mr. Hearne. Sir,—My daughter, 12 years of age, had a
very bad cough that had been a trouble to her for years
I tried every cough remedy I could get, but not one of
them seemed to do her any good. Then I tried one bottle
of your Bronchitis Cure, and she has never coughed since
she finished it. lam glad to say the effect has been won-
derful.—Yours, etc.,

CONSUMPTION.
TOO ILL TO LEAVE HIS BED.
A COMPLETE CURE.
Mr. W. G. Hearne.
Dear Sir, lam writing to tell you about the wonderful
cure your medicine has effected in my case. About three
years ago I began to cough. At first the cough was not
severe, but it gradually got worse, and I became very
weak and troubled with night sweats, pain in my chest,
and great quantities of phlegm. On several occasions
there was blood in the expectorated matter. I had been
treated by a doctor, who pronounced my case to be
consumption, and various other treatments had been
tried, but without benefit. It was at this stage that I
heard of your Bronchitis Cure, and sent to you for a
course of the medicine. When it arrived, I was' too ill to
leave my bed, but I commenced taking it at once, and
gradually improved. lam glad to say that the two lots
of medicine you sent have effected a complete cure, for
i for which accept my very best thanks.—Yours gratefully

DISTRESSING, SUFFOCATING, DRY COUGH FOR

ENTIRELY REMOVED BY FIVE DOSES OF HEARNE’S
BRONCHITIS CURE.
NO OTHER TREATMENT COULD EVEN EASE IT.
Sir,—My wife was for twelve years a sufferer from a most
distressing, suffocating, dry cough, that could not be
removed or even eased by any remedy, doctor’s prescrip-
tions, and patent medicines having been tried ; but I am
happy to state that the cough, pain in the chest, and
difficulty' of breathing, etc., were entirely removed by the
fifth dose of your Bronchitis Cure. I remain, sir, yours
most respectfully',

Mr. W. G. Hearne. Dear Sir, —Kindly send me one
large bottle of your Bronchitis Cure. I am more than
pleased with the results of your wonderful medicine, as a
small bottle cured my little girl, who had been suffering
for five years, and now I do not feel safe to be without
it.—l remain yours respectfully,

CURE.
IT ACTED LIKE MAGIC.
Mr. W. G. Hearne. Dear Sir, —It affords me very much
pleasure to give you an unsolicited testimonial as to the
great merits of your wonderful Bronchitis Cure. I can
say without hesitation that as a chest medicine it has no
equal. Having had Bronchitis in a severe form it com-
pletely cured me, and now in the Winter months if I at
all contract a cold on the chest it gives me instant relief.
I have also proved its efficacy with members of mv
family, whom it has always cured of coughs, colds on the
chest, also sore throats. It has acted like magic. Sir
3ou are deserving of the best thanks of the community
for introducing to suffering humanity such a valuable
medicine.
I remain, grateful] v yours,

For twelve weeks I persevered with
these treatments without noticeable bene-
fit. I was then persuaded to give Zam-
Buk a trial. I accordingly purchased a
pot from our local chemist, and was
amazed to find that after a few dressings
with the Balm the sores were thoroughly
healed, leaving the skin with a clean,
healthy, and unbroken appearance. Since
then I have had further cause to test
Zam-Buk’s healing power amongst
the children, and can only say that it
is unequalled. No household should
be without a pot of this wonderful

ST. PURERAU’S EXCURSION.
[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
WHEN Jones was placed under sus-
pension till a Committee of Inquiry
should investigate the circumstances
surrounding his loss of one 40-ton engine, three
carriages, 19 trucks and one brake-van, to say
nothing of over 100 tons of freight, he was
relieved at Burning Plains by Mr. Knutsford.
Old man Giles, the station-master, was desper-
ately anxious to have Barclay back, and he set to
work to make a prompt transfer of Knutsford
highly desirable in the interests of the Depart-
ment.
Knutsford lasted 10 days, and at noon of the
11th he appeared “ on the eafpet ” in Manager
Mackenzie’s room in dire disgrace. It was a
humorous interview; Mackenzie demanded seven-
teen explanations, and every time Knutsford
opened his mouth to supply them the Manager
would jump to his feet and roar at him, threaten-
ing him with instant execution and subsequent
dismissal if he dared to give him “back-talk.”
The Manager said impressively :
“Now, I have formulated seventeen specific
charges against you, and you have failed to
even palliate one of them. You want a hard
master, and you shall have him. Do you know
what I’ll do with you ? ”
Knutsford, not being allowed to speak, shook
his head.
“I’ll send you down to Laurence —he’ll break
you up, damn you.”
“Well, all I want” -
“WILL you keep quiet? Say another word,
and you won’t get even the chance of going to
Laurence. Go straight down now. You’ll wish
yourself dead by the end of the week.” He
waved his hand with Jenkins-like majesty
towards the door, and Knutsford went out.
Romahapa Goods was situated in the same
building, but immediately below the Traffic Office,
so in less than five minutes Knutsford found him-
self appointed “Sheds Messenger.” It was an
awful indignity, and the fallen officer was almost
inclined to commit suicide under the humiliation.
To make matters worse, they had a better concep-
tion of the refinement of cruelty in the Goods
than in any other part of the service, and it was all
very rough. He found himself addressed as Mr.
Blanky Station-Master, and requested to do the
most menial things with magniloquent sarcasm.
In addition to rushing round the various sheds
with invoices and manifests, he had to address
the envelopes in which the monthly statements
were posted to merchants and others who had
ledger accounts with the Department, and he
was everybody’s varlet. A dozen voices would
yell for him simultaneously, and those he could
not attend to would abuse him in terms of mock
politeness. The ledger-keeper ordered him to
go up town and buy him sixpenn’orth of snuff,
and threatened physical persuasion when Knuts-
ford gave him a fervent refusal. But, worst of
all, he was subjected to a series of practical jokes
which would have disgraced an ape garden. Who
his tormentors were he had no means of discover-
ing, but he found out that the whole office
was waiting anxiously to see him do what it
called “fly off his block.” The discovery caused
him to keep a tight grip of his temper, and the
long-lodked-for satisfaction never came off.
When Knutsford got the correct view of his
surroundings he found that the bulk of the men
were decent fellows, and that all his troubles
proceeded from a coterie of seven, known as
“The Church of St. Pulcerau’s.” These ruffians
had banded themselves together into a mock
church, and the only way any new-comer could
obtain lasting peace, as far as his stay in the
Goods was concerned, was to be baptised. This
function was carried out at an office up town, in
the evening, with beer, according to the rites of
the Anglican Church. The Church would drink
the beer and pour the dregs over the head of the
neophyte, after which more blasphemous cere-
monies were indulged in, and a bottle of whisky
broached just to “burst up” the beer. The
Church continued its persecutions till the new-
comer gave way, and for the sake of peace sub-
mitted to go through the ghastly business.
Several fellows had appealed to the Manager,
but that dignitary seemed unable to do anything.
Once or twice he tried to break up the organisa-
tion by shifting its leaders, but as they were not
all-round railway men, and in most cases trained
only to Goods work, they soon drifted back. The
new men who had started the fight against the
Church of St. Pukerau’s drifted out on to the
lines again and soon forgot all about it as far as
taking any active part went.
At the end of the week there was a lull in
Knutsford’s persecution, and another messenger
asked him had he joined the Church. Knutsford
said he hadn’t, and didn’t intend to. The other
messenger, also a disrated sub-Station-Master, said
it was just as well for the sake of peace.
The Church was very angry when it heard of
Knutsford’s defiance, and reckoned it would shake
him up so that by the end of the week he would
gladly bring along the beer to save his life. Mean-
while he was laid under an interdict, and the
Church cursed him formally every morning.
But Knutsford’s hobby was chemistry, and he
made up a few mixtures for the benefit of the
Church, and when he got fairly started St.
Pukerau’s had anything but a rosy time of it.
* * * *
The Goods, as a whole, came on duty at 9 a.m.
—that was the bulk of the clerical staff, although,
of course, there were always some officers on duty
night and day. Mutrie, the senior invoicer,
arrived at his desk one morning and found his
fancy vulcanite penholder all smeared with some
pink substance that had dried on it. He let off a
string of language that caused the ledger-keeper
to turn green with envy. Then the ledger-keeper
discovered that his ink-well was empty, and he
made a few objurgations on his own account, and,
as Knutsford was not there, got the bottle to fill
the well himself. As he passed down the passage
between the desks the senior invoicer grabbed his
pen to see what was on it. Immediately he
touched the pink substance there was a sound of
a dry twig being suddenly snapped, and the
invoicer hurled his penholder towards the ceiling
with a yell, and then danced round, showing his
startled mates three fingers that were bleeding
where the skin had been split by the force of the
explosion.
The ledger-keeper stigmatised it as an outrage
when he returned with the ink bottle. He also
said it was a dog’s trick. Then he poured a large
quantity of ink into his desk-well, but something
inside shot it out again much faster, and all in a
moment his beaming countenance, snowy shirt-
front and silk vest were specked with hissing
writing fluid. The ledger-keeper held the bottle
with one hand, and with the other strove to wipe
he ink from hi 3 countenance, and swore furiously
with all his soul. The rest of the office yelled
hilariously, and reckoned the honors were with
the “blanky Station-master.”
Gordon, the abstract-clerk, amused himself by
wrapping up with the lunch in Knutsford’s desk
a rather ancient deceased pig-fish. A few minutes
later the whole office complained of the odor, and
at last Laurence himself came out and used
language which, while not obscene or profane, was
extremely cutting. The odor was traced to
Knutsford’s desk, and when that unhappy indi-
vidual arrived he found a carpenter prizing open
the desk with a chisel, while the Goods Agent
stood by holding his nose. In spite of Knutsford’s
protests, the desk was searched, and the decayed
pig-fish found in his lunch. The Goods Agent
looked at him in amazement, and then spat on
the floor and executed a rapid retirement.
The admiring glances which the rest of the
staff directed on the abstract-clerk while they
made weird remarks about fish luncheons betrayed
Gordon. He had put in three weeks’ hard work
at ten hours a day on his abstracts. They were
beautiful to see. The bold Vere Foster hand-
writing and the beautiful figures were Gordon’s
delight and the pride of the office. He kept
these documents in a large, deep, roomy desk,
under lock and key. Gordon’s weakness was
colonial stout, and with his abstracts he
always kept a number of bottles of his favorite
beverage. The morning after that pig-fish had
got into Knutsford’s lunch Gordon came down to
find porter dripping from the desk in which he
kept his stock and abstracts. He opened it in a
frenzy of fear. Two bottles had been mysteri-
ously broken, and the contents had soaked
through his abstracts and made most of them
unreadable. He told the Goods Agent he believed
someone—one of the messengers, probably—had
managed to break them on purpose; but the
Goods Agent scouted the idea. Then he looked
fixedly at Mr. Gordon and hoped that he had not
played any trick on the messengers which would
rouse one of them to take such a revenge. “ That
pig-fish incident was very smelly in more ways
than one,” he remarked, thoughtfully; “and if I
knew who had played such a horrible joke on that
young fellow I would make him change places
with him.”
At this terrible threat Gordon excused himself,
and set to work, with the assistance of two
cadets, to make out all his abstracts afresh, and
it kept him so busy he had no time for any more
practical jokes for the rest of the month.
. * * »
The correspondence clerk, who was supposed to
be the Goods Agent’s watch-dog, came home
drunk at 8.30, and held an At-Home to a choice
assortment of bar loafers in the Goods Agent’s
private room and his own office.
Laurence himself arrived at nine sharp, and
the frowsy gang which was revelling on cheap
beer in his own office roused him to such fury that
he seized his C.O. to throw him out. Then his
watch dog turned on him with the fury of a bull-
pup and assaulted him, and he was rescued with
great difficulty by the rest of the staff. The C.O.
was placed under suspension, which was only the
first step to dismissal, and the office waited breath-
lessly to hear who would be appointed to the posi-
tion, which, barring the billets of the accountant
and Goods Agent himself, was the best in the De-
partment.
Knutsford, who had been badly kicked in the
struggle, had gone home early. About ten
minutes past five a tall stranger entered the side
door in a surreptitious sort of manner, and grip-
ping the Deacon by the elbow, asked in a half-
whisper where Knutsford was.
“He’s gone. Anything I can do for you?”
asked the Deacon in a frigid manner.
“Oh, it’s nothing,” said the tall stranger.
“ I’m down for a holiday —met him at Popatunoa
—an’ I wanted him to bring some of his mates an’
have a jollo at the pub down here. I’ve got some
moneys to burn.”
The Deacon’s manner changed in a wonderful
way.
“ Oh, I see. Nice fellow, Knutsy. He won’t
be back for a month, but if that’s all you want, I
can bring his friends along. There are six of ’em
beside myself. We call ourselves the Church of
St. Pukerau, and, my son, the Church is in all
matters willing to come to the help of her children
—yea, and the friends of her children when they
have moneys to burn. Amen.”
The tall stranger gasped. “ All right. Seven
you say. Bring ’em over, an’ I’ll go and see
they’ve got some ham and things like that.”
And the departing stranger winked solemnly at
the Deacon as he glided out of the door in a Red
Indian sort of fashion.
The Deacon hurried round and spread the joy-
ful tidings among the hierarchy. At six sharp
they sailed out, found the affluent stranger waiting
up the street, and proceeded in single file to the
Shunters’ Arms, opposite the B shed.
# * * *
The Deacon awoke first. Immediately he be-
came aware of the fact that the atmosphere was
far from fresh. But he was in pitchy darkness.
He heard the sound of elephantine snores, and,
stretching out, felt a head which he knew was that
of the senior invoicer.
“ Say, Dean,” he inquired, giving his brother
ecclesiastic a kick, “are we in a heaven-blessed
fowl-house, or where ? ”
The Dean awoke and sniffed vigorously for a
moment.
“Think we’re in Gehenna. Why, damn it,
we’re moving.”
Someone struck a light, and swore vigorously as
it burnt his unsteady lingers.
“ Hullo, Archbishop, where the devil are we?’
shouted the Deacon, recognising the voice of the
swearer.
“Phew! how it does hum ! ” cursed the Arch-
bishop, striking another light, which promptly
went out.
The Deacon cautiously arose to his feet, and,
after much argument, discovered that the whole
Church was present, but not the affluent stranger.
Nobody had any more matches, and the only thing
they could be certain of was that they were in a
closed-in malodorous truck, and were being taken
somewhere they had no idea of. What it all
meant, they could not guess.
The train spun on. Occasionally they heard the
three short, sharp whistles for brakes. They
heard the clank of points as they rushed over
them. But there were no stoppages —they just
spun on and on. The driving was so bumpy that
they understood they were not on a passenger
train, and the lack of stoppages raised a terrible
dread in their minds that they were on the mid-
night goods.
They tried to talk, but the horror of their posi-
tion took all conversational power out of them.
They tried to open the side doors, but soon found
they were locked. They were all cramped toge-
ther, for all the rest of the van was filled with
wicker crates that smelt horribly.
After weary days, or what seemed like days,
the train began to slow down, and finally stopped.
There was a sound of feet on gravel.
“Hey, Guard; let us out of this! We’re
locked in 1 ”
The sounding of the feet ceased, and a scared
voice asked
“ What are you doing there, anyhow ? ”
“Somebody locked us in. Let’s out. Be
quick, man ; the stink in here is devilish.”
“ It’s pretty bad out here. I’ll see about you.”
Presently he came back, and there were sounds
of other footsteps.
“ Say, boys, how many of you are there ? ”
“ Seven ! ” they replied, hopefully.
“ Better not do it. Ten to one they’re lunatics
for Ocean Cliff, shunted on to the wrong train ;
and what chance would four of us have with
them ?” said a new voice.
“Better stay where you are, boys, till we get to
the terminus. You see there’s nowhere else you
can ride,” said the first voice, coaxingly.
“ Well, we don’t want to ride; we’d sooner
walk any day,” yelled the Deacon, while the rest
flung objurgations at the official for not letting
them out.
“Look at the truck way-bill, and see if that
throws any light on the subject?” said the other
voice; and the sound of both pairs of feet
scrunching the shingle died away in the distance,
Presently they returned.
“ What’s the number of the truck ? ” said one.
“ K 246. That’s them, all right.”
“Are you going to let us out?” yelled the
whole Church.
“How many of you are there?” queried the
first voice
“Seven. We told you that before. Unfasten
the door vou ! ”
“Well, you’ll have to stay there—you’re booked
through to the terminus. Seven reptiles, the
way-bill says, marked ‘ Dangerous, ’ and by
heavens, judging by the way you hum, you are
dangerous. Good morning, lads.”
A whistle blew, and the train started off with
a jerk. For several more weeks, or what seemed
like weeks, they toiled up grades, thundered
down inclines, rocked round curves, and groaned
and cursed as they lay on the hard floor of the
truck in pitchy darkness. Every time they
stormed at a station footsteps would approach the
truck, and someone would listen cautiously. But
there was no need to listen, for the now half-
demented seven abused the universe generally,
As for the guard, they threatened him with the
most horrible forms of dismemberment that the
human mind could devise, and the guard shud-
dered and thanked his stars he hadn’t unlocked
the door when they first hailed him. It was a
cargo of dangerous lunatics right enough.
When morning came the daylight gleamed
faintly through the ventilators and showed them
their ghastly surroundings. They were in a truck
that was devoted exclusively to the poultrj trade,
and with the exception of the few square feet in
the centre, where they lay, it was filled from floor
to roof with returned empty crates. A fowl truck
never smells very sweet, but the fiend who had
thrown them in there had added to their discom-
fort by spraying their clothing liberally with
some vile liquid, and each man was a horror to
himself and all the others.
When the light came they tried to make them-
selves a little more comfortable by sitting back to
back, and so giving mutual support, and they
made several attempts to reason out how they had
arrived at their present dreadful situation. Until
the light came the Archbishop was certain they
were all dead and gone where the originators of
mock churches are likely to go. It was such a
blessed relief to find himself really alive again,
that he felt almost happy—or would have but for
the odor. .
“ We’re slowing down, and he s whistling for
the signal,” said the Precentor.
“ Wonder if we ye any chance of being at the
offic ® at 9 th f morning, speculated the Cura e.
“Not a hope. said the Dean. Wont
Sammy perform when he finds the whole seven of
us away. What a lucky thing we re all in it; he d
hardly sack the lot, and when there are seven in
it he will believe we have been the victims of some
infernal villainy. Wish we had that long brute
with the money here ; he must have doctored the
grog.” , a
_ “ I’ll bet next month s screw, said the Super-
intendent of the Sunday-school, that thing
Knutsford s at the bottom of it. I knew you
blokes would bite off more n you could chew some
day, with your horse-play ; and you have.
The whole company made replies, but the
Superintendent relapsed into gloomy silence. He
was married, and had a wholesome dread of his
wife, and between facing Sammy and the irate
missus he felt worried. Besides, his head ached
and his back felt broken right across.
Then the train came to a standstill, but no one
came near the truck. The Dean looked at his
watch, it was 6.10 a.m. There were sounds of
shunting in the distant sidings, the whistle of
Avonside engines, and the bumping of trucks.
“Funny they don’t come and investigate;
we’ve been in this siding 15 minutes now. Say,
boys, d’you think there’s any chance of our being left
in a back siding Jail we die of thirst. Mythioats
like a lime-kiln. _ . _
This horrible suggestion temporarily deprived
the clergy of the power of speech, and before
they recovered it they heard a key in the lock of
the door. It was pushed back slightly, and when
the aperture appeared they saw a young porter
jump hurriedly away. , , , ,
In a moment they wereon their feet had pushed
the door back, and leaped out into the morning
sunshine. , „ ... , ,
A ring of solemn-faced men armed with let
weapons of every variety waited round the door
of the truck, and next moment they were rushec
and secured. . , .
The Station-master, his hands in his pockets,
came down and looked at them with a deeply
thoughtful expression. He seemed puzzled. Li-
side the cadet was calling VR, V ,
the telegraphic instrument. .
The invoicer, otherwise the Dean, was the only
telegraphist m the crowd, and the call Vtt
filled him with terror. He addressed the b.M.,
“ We re not on the Inver gar y Section, are we.
You are. This is Waimea Junction. A
you a telegraphist. ■ u „ v„„„ .
“ Oh, Lord ; we re done for . Boys, y
We are at Waimea Junction,
“ Who are you ? asked the b.M.
“We’re clerks from S. J. Laurencesothce,

played a trick on us got us drunk, or drugged us.
and trucked us right down here. It 11 be serious
when we get back. , , „
“ I guess it will, if Sammy hasn t altered

“Do you know him ? asked the Dean,
“I graduated under him. He turned to the
porter: ‘ Untie these gentlemen. Iveieported


DOH’T NEGLECT THAT ACHING BACK.
Backache is Really
Kidney Ache.
Backache is really kidney ache :
the ache comes from the kidneys,
which lie just beneath the small of
the back. When the back is weak
and lame—when it “ cricks ” if you
turn sharply or stoop—when it
burns with a burning ache, and
keeps you awake half the night—-
when you cannot bend without a
stab-like pain taking you—when it
makes nard work of the least task
—give your kidneys help at once in
Doan’s Backache Kidney Pills.
Doan s Pills are a Special Kidney
and bladder medicine; they give
strength and tone to the kidneys
themselves, and so cure the cause
of backache, gravel, rheumatic
pains, watery swellings in the
ankles and beneath the eyes, urin-
ary troubles, dizzy spells, pains in
the limbs, spots before the eyes,
sallow complexion, etc.

A SYDNEY MAN’S LASTING CURE
BY DOAN’S PILLS.
Mr. Jos. Grieve, Wood and Coal Merchant, 18
Albion-street, Surry Hills, states :—“For the past five
or six years I have suffered from kidney disorder, which
caused me constant pain. The symptoms of this ter-
rible complaint were severe backache and irregularity
of the secretions. The pain had such complete mastery
over me that at times I could not rise from my bed. I
went to doctors to see what their skill could do for me,
but gained no benefit from them. I tried medicines, with
no better results. One day I saw an advertisement
regarding a remedy for kidney trouble, and, as it was
not a nostrum said to cure everything under the sun, I
procured a box of Doan’s Backache Kidney Pills. I
felt a sense of relief right from the first dose. My pain
gradually grew less, and finally disappeared, as did the
other symptoms of kidney disorder.”
This is Mr. Grieve’s testimony, given twelve months
after: —“Twelve months ago I was cured by Doan’s
Backache Kidney Pills. lam still a believer in these
Pills, having never had a return of my complaint since,
except on one occasion, when I got wet; but a few
doses of these Pills quickly set me right again. Nothing
ever gave me relief but Doan’s Backache Pills, and

Mr. Grieve makes a third statement (11/2/’O5), fully
six years after he made his first statement. He says :
“I am still well. I always keep a box of Doan’s Back-
ache Kidney Pills in the house. I know of no other
medicine so excellent for curing disordered kidneys.
Many call at my yard to ask me about my cure, and I
never fail to recommend the medicine which cured me.”

. -The Church hadn’t, and the Dean proposed that
they should take up a collection. The old S.M.
smiled and contributed the requisite amount. As
they wandered over to the hotel, the Archbishop
said thoughtfully
Brethren, I had to deceive him. I had only
sufficient to obtain one hair of the dog for each of
us.
. they got back to the station an hour later
they felt better under the combined influences of
the ban 1 of the dog, the shower, and the breakfast.
It s all right,” said the S.M. ; “ here’s a wire
about you ” —and he passed over the slip. It
read: “ S.M., Waimea Junction. Please instruct

When the Church saw that Knutsford had got
the coveted billet it collapsed utterly, and only
hick of money prevented it drowning its grief and
dismay in liquor.

The Call of the Dream Man.
[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
? rnWAS his voice in the darkness calling—l
heard and I dared not stay,
Though as faint as a white star falling
afar from the Milky Way
Was the glimmering light he carried—too dim
was the moon to guide;
And I knew that the Dream Man tarried for none
on the way beside;
That in vain might they plead for pardon who
strayed from his haunted wood ;
Yet I stole from the scented garden where the
odorous blossoms stood,
Little caring nor whither knowing ; the sentinel,
sombre Night,
About me her mantle throwing, I followed the
Dream Man’s light.
Shadow shapes in the misty moon-rays—all sensi-
tive, shrinking things
lhat are hid from the glaring noon-rays, housed
under the brooding wings
Of the sheltering dark, to meet me came forth
with their eyes a-shine.
For the Mother 'Bush bent to greet me, and gave
me the secret sign,
And the pass to her hidden places and wondrous
things behind—
I was free of her great, green spaces, and free of
the woods and wind,
For she taught me the words they uttered in
mystical unknown tongue,
I ill I knew what the star-breeze muttered the
fluttering leaves among.
But a moon-flower wreath to weave me, I lagged
by my lover’s door ;
And the Dream Man turned to leave me as those
he had left before ;
“For the rapture of soft endearment to thee were
all boon above,”
But I clung to his trailing cerement : “O,
Master, I only love ! ”
And I turned from my heart’s desire, and followed
him through the night,
Till he whispered in words of fire, “Go sing of
thy love aright ! ”
And 1 sang as the Dream Man taught me—my
love and my song grown bold,
Till the wandering night wind brought me a
perfume I loved of old.
And my soul to its bonds returned, and passed
from the haunted wood,
And I sought what the Dream Man spurned
where odorous blossoms stood,
Till I entered the scented garden —rose wreathed,
with gates ajar....
I would plead for the Dream Man’s pardon; but
faint is his light and far.
For pity is not for pardon, though cold are his
eyes and hard,
But my soul in the scented garden is shut —and
the gates are barred.
A Voice in the darkness wailing—l hear, but I
dare not go !
And a light o’er the pine ridge failing drops into
the night below.
N.s.w.
LOLA RIDGE.
“Pinkey.”
[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
I BELIEVE you thought I was a bit
mad when I walked back those three miles
in the heat to-day, to dig out that
‘ miserable little snake,’ as you called it, that we
saw as we were coming I. • ~'e from the yards. I
always make a point of kil'b.g =nakes whenever I
see them, especially tigers, e\v.\ ■: means a ten-
mile walk. This one, to-day, was a tiger, as
savage and venomous a one as but I’ll tell you.
“Pinkey was the littlest kid that used to come
to the school. She was also the youngest, and
had the furthest to come, as her people were the
latest selectors, and every selector used to have
to get further back than the one that came before
him. I fancy they were very poor, poorer even
than the run of us, and of course we were all
hard up. And Pinkey was all there was in the
family.
“ The school was a little hut with a bark roof
and walls of untrimmed rough-split slabs, with
gaping cracks where the slabs had shrunk after
being put up. Some of the cracks were stuffed
up with pieces of bag and canvas. The floor was
of the same slabs, laid on the ground, and not
nailed or fixed in any way. In the winter we
used to lift up the slabs and catch the frogs that
were hiding underneath. One single pane of
glass served as a window, and there was a great
shingled fireplace that took up all one end of the
room. The building belonged to the station, and
was about a quarter of a mile from the homestead.
The teacher was paid partly by the Government
and partly by the squatter. There were about
nine children attending—three from the station
and the rest from the selections. We used to
think the teacher was a beast. Now I know that
the life must have been an awful one for any girl.
She always smiled on the station youngsters, and
always frowned on us, and thrashed us, and boxed
our ears with books, and kept us in, and did
everything but kill us outright.
“ Pinkey used to come to school by herself,
across their own scrubby selection and on to a
rough track, with logs and torn-up trees across it
here and there. On each side were tall yackoos,
and ferns, and sometimes a clump of ti-tree. Big
Jim Hawkins would generally wait for her on the
track, and they would trudge along together
laughing to see the kangaroos scurry away into
the bush, and often happy in the possession of a
young bird or ’possum. Pinkey generally had
boots, but the last ones she had got worn out, and
she had been coming for a week or two without
any. One morning, with a scorching hot wind
blowing, she was hurrying along the dusty track
when, in jumping over a log, she slipped and a
root went into her foot and broke half-way in,
leaving a wide gash and a great black piece of
wood in the wound. Pinkey cried a bit, then
limped along to where Jim Hawkins was waiting.
Jim tried to get the wood out with his old, blunt
pocket-knife, but Pinkey shivered and cried, so he
had to give it up with the assurance that he would
| have a go ’ at ic at playtime, when they’d wash
it at the school well, and he’d sharpen his knife
real sharp on his boot.
“ They were late for school, and the teacher, who
always seemed to have an extra ‘set ’ on Pinkey,
boxed her ears and sent her to her place with
pain in her ears and agony in the poor, swollen
foot. Why the teacher hated Pinkey I don’t
know, unless it was that she seldom cried when
caned—only stared hard at the teacher with great,
wondering, puzzled eyes, and when she was
scolded and pushed here and pulled there, the
wide eyes would look up so seriously and inquir-
ingly. I fancy it used to get on the teacher’s
nerves, especially when the children from the
station were more outrageous than usual, and she
had to vent her feelings on someone. That some-
one was generally Pinkey.
“ This particular morning Pinkey kept moving
the wounded, smarting, foot, trying to find a cool
spot for it, and got caned for it, and gazed into
the teacher’s face, and got caned for that. Then
the agony in her foot made her move it again, and
again the cane came down on the throbbing hands
and shoulders. Then she was set a sum—simple
addition, I remember it was—and got the answer
wrong, and tried again, worked hard, and got it
wrong again. She whispered tremblingly to Jim
that the figures on the slate were jumping about
and making queer faces at her, and her foot was
‘Oh, so sore.’ ‘You’ll bring the water up from
the well to bathe it at play time, so as I’ll not
have to walk to the well, won’t you ? ’ she asked
Jim, anxiously, and Jim nodded.
“Then dinner-time came, and the sum was still
wrong. ‘ You will stay on during the dinner hour
and get that sum right,’ ordered the teacher.
Poor Pinkey gazed up in her face without a word,
while the cool water and the shady trees passed
through her mind. Then her eyes travelled siftvyly
to the little calico bag with the draw-string, in
which was her dinner—not that she was hungry
though it was many hours since she had had a cup
of black tea and a scrap of bread in the morning
but perhaps dinner would take the burning pain
out of her head and foot, and then the figures on
the cracked slate might stop still and let them-
selves be added up quietly. ‘ No, you are not to
have any lunch, ’ and the teacher took the little
bag out with her and locked the door.
“Then at last Pinkey cried, smearing out the
figures on the slate and sobbing hopelessly. Ji m
looked in through the pane of glass, and tried to
console her by saying he would carry her some of
the way home, and offered her one of his emu egg-
shells. Then he ran after the others, who were
already nearly down to the old well in the hollow
near the red gums. Pinkey. left alone, sobbed
herself quiet, then carefully examined the
wounded foot, and while doing this heard a sound
behind her, and looked round just in time to see
a tiger snake slipping through a crack in the wall.
Pinkey had all a bush child’s horror of snakes.
She never left home without the warning, ‘ Now,
mind snakes,’ ringing in her ears. And to be
alone in a room for perhaps an hour with one was
more than she could stand. She looked round
for something to hit it with, but saw nothing.
Then she remembered that her stool had a loose
leg, which fell out whenever the seat was moved.
“ She hastily pulled this out, but first she took
her ragged sun-bonnet from the nail and threw it
for the snake to watch, as she had many a time
seen Jim throw his hat under similar circum-
stances. Then, running up, she dealt the snake a
blow with the leg of the stool, but with head erect
and flat, and its forked tongue darted viciously,
the snake sprang to meet her, and, as the blow
fell, it caught Pinkey by the bare foot and hung
there. With a scream of terror that reached even
the children at the well, and brought them rum
ning up, Pinkey tore the snake off and flung it
into the middle of the room.
“ ‘ What’s up ? ’ asked Jim, as his face, scarlet
with running, appeared at the window.
“ ‘lt bited me ! The snake bited me ! I want to
go home ! ’ screamed Pinkey, her face pallid with
horror.
“ ‘Cut the piece out! Here’s my knife,’ said
Jim, hurriedly throwing his old blunt knife
through the pane of glass. Pinkey sat down and
tried to cut her foot; but it was too much for her.
“ Some of the children had run for the teacher,
Jim meanwhile hurling himself vainly against the
locked door, and hearing Pinkey wailing inside
‘ I want to go home ! It bited me ! It bited me
on the sore foot.’
“ The teacher came running, followed by the
squatter, who eyed the unlocking of the door with
stern disapproval. ‘ What for need you lock the
puir wee thing up ? ’ he asked; but for once
got no answer. They all went in together.
“ There on the floor lay the snake, with its back
broken, darting its flattened head about in a vain
effort to escape, and biting its own body in blind
fury. And in the corner, near the fireplace, lay
Pinkey, now only a quivering heap of clothes.
The wide, unseeing eyes still wore their look of
wonder, and on the little brown dusty foot that
would never again trudge wearily along the rough
track, just above the cruel gash, with the broken
wood still showing plainly, were two tiny punc-
tures. The childish hand still grasped Jim’s open
knife.
“Yes, I always kill snakes whenever I see
them—especially tigers.”

Ayer’s Sarsaparilla is a wonderful medicine. We
give below the testimony of a grateful husband:
V*

y
“My wife has all her life long been
subject to rush of blood to the head
and fainting-fits. In later years these
were more frequent, ana her skin be-
came very sallow. She had scarcely
any appetite, and it was not safe to
leave her at home by herself for fear
of a fainting-fit. I may state we had
medical advice both in England and
here in New Zealand, but it did no
good; so, some months back, I sug-
gested that she take Ayer’s Sarsapa-
rilla. She protested against it, be-
lieving it to be quackery, but I pur-
chased a bottle just to give it a trial,
and the result was marvelous. Mrs.
Moul has taken five bottles, and now
she is a new creature.
“I forward yon her photo by this mail, and you can make what use
you think proper of this statement. Yours gratefully.” —John F.
Moul, Ty-Coed, Swanson, Auckland.
“P.S. I omitted stating that the photo was taken since using the
Sarsaparilla.”
Bo sure you get the right kind of Sarsaparilla —“AYER’S.” Don’t
let anybody induce you to try some other kind. You will regret it
if you do.
If you are not in good, vigorous health, if your nerves are not so
Strong as you wish, if you are feeling run down and depressed, buy
AYER’S Sarsaparilla
today and begin the certain cure.
