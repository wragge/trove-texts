Henry Handel Richardson
A new novel by Henry Handel Richardson
recently appeared, “The Way Home,” being
the second part of an Australian trilogy.
The present volume is set chiefly in Mel-
bourne of the ’seventies, as the first, “The
Fortunes of Richard Mahony,” was in Bal-
larat of the ’fifties. The trilogy is thus
well under weigh.
Henry Handel Richardson as a novelist
has had a strange history. The first pub-
lished novel, “Maurice Guest,” appeared in
England in 1908, a single edition. It won
recognition; its readers were few, but they
remembered the book. It became known in
America, in Scandinavia, and in Europe
generally. . It was translated into French
and German. At length a second English
edition was published—in 1922. The seconc
book to appear was a short novel, “The
Getting of Wisdom,” in 1910. Then came a
break, with “The Fortunes of Rieharc
Mahony” in 1917; and now, this year, its
successor, “The Way Home.”
“Maurice Guest” was a remarkable book
and one that would not go out of date; anc
its subject happened to be one that would
link it up with the people of several nations
at once. The setting was the life of music
students in Leipzig during the ’nineties.
Apart from its central theme, the book gives
fascinating vignettes of students and other
foreign residents —American (several vari-
eties), English and Continental. Considered
merely as a chatter book in the manner of,
say, "Penelope’s Adventures in England,”
the book might have had its vogue. But the
story of Maurice Guest was not a mere
thread to bind some chatter together. The
theme is one of gi’eat power, the story of a
hopeless passion, a grand passion lodged in
a frail personality, which in the end it
breaks: —
He, having neither strength nor saving occupation,
had bartered all he had, and, knowingly, for the
beauty of this face; and as long as it existed for
him, his home was beside it.
The young English student, Maurice Guest,
ended by shooting himself: the book shows
why he did it. Full of hesitations and awk-
wardness, and with a very mediocre talent,
. lie was a discord in the humming musical
life of Leipzig. A young composer gives i.
recital of a piano-cycle composed round some oil
Nietzsche’s lyrics. Maurice’s own hold on
these interests becomes visibly weaker. You
see him on the verge of his collapse: “With
the over-anxious readiness to oblige, which
was becoming one of his most marked traits,
and, in reality, cloaked a deathly indifference,
Maurice sat forward to listen.”
Having that fragment of psychological
exactitude in mind, we can turn from
“Maurice Guest” and look at the author’s
second book, a short novel called “The Get-
ting of Wisdom.” Making no great stir
when it appeared, it has unfortunately not
been reprinted. It is a brief, thorough and
sincere account of a girl’s life at a large
Melbourne boarding-school about 80 years
ago. Being unlike, say, “Little Women” or
“Teens” or other books for girls themselves,
it leaves out the usual emotional appeal and
simply represents, in vivid little chapters,
a girl’s adolescent years—lB to 18. The
book would almost seem like an enlightened
document for psychologists, if it were not so
full of a personal humor and so well-rooted
in a definite soil. A drive from Spencer-
street station across Melbourne in a phaeton,
a walk under the trees of Collins-street on
a sunny Saturday morning, a summer holi-
day in a eottage among the sandy dunes of
Sorrento —this is all too vivid for any dia-
grammatic manual.
In 1917, of all times, appeared “The For-
tunes of Richard Mahony.”’ A bad date for
a solid novel dealing with the early days in
Ballarat! It would be well if people rubbed
their eyes now and read that book, over-
looked at the time. Richard Mahony, a
West-British kind of Irishman, settles “on
Ballarat” first as a storekeeper, then, after
painful difficulties, as a doctor. You see the
panorama of the goldfields mostly through his
eyes: and he was always a stiffisk man.
Eureka is a disturbance on his sky-line;
Melbourne is a gimerack mushroom. At the
end of this very sizable book, Richard aud
his sweet little wife. Polly, are sailing for
the Old Country. The present book, “The
Way Home,” begins by showing the in-
tractable Richard fighting for a practice in
England, and finding that a “colonial” doc-
tor has no status, while his “colonial” wife’s
overflowing hospitality is taken as vulgar
ostentation. They return to Melbourne, to
opulent, restless Melbourne of the ’seventies.
Their son, born during that decade, will
assuredly make a hero for the third volume
of the Fortunes.
“The Way Home” is a book with its own
rather faded kind of charm. It may be said
to “date,” curiously enough, more than the
Ballarat volume does. In “The Way Home”
you meet mostly with ladies and gentle-
men—that is, with “persons of fashion,” and
fashions are. by definition, apt to change.
In “Richard Mahony” you met simpler people,
more roughcast. In “Maurice Guest,” again,
nearly everyone was more or less of an
artist; there arc fashions in art, but the
artist’s basic relation to life remains con-
stant. So perhaps it is natural that “The
Way Home,” as a study of manners, should
seem like a warm room with drawn Venetian
blinds : in the middle of such a room hangs
a large chandelier, made from a, thousand
pieces of cut glass; there are antimacassars;
and tlic color of the furniture is magenta.
Enter a whiskered gentleman with a volume
by a modern writer of verse named Brown-
ing. Enter a moderately crinolined lady
with needlework. They discuss spiritualism
and "'the upheaval recently caused by the
reading of Darwin. Outside in the sun there
is a well-kept carriage-drive, ending with
pine-trees, and a sandy road of suburban
Melbourne.
But it is the whole output of Henry
Handel Richardson that needs to be kept
in mind. The writing is crisp and elastic,
with few peculiarities except one or two
that suggest more than a bowing acquaint-
ance with German. “Richard was wear.v
and mm slept.” ( Vngcschlafen?) The chief
quality, though, of this author is an atti-
tude of “hands off” towards the characters:
they are presented with the least possible
interference. Such scrupulous treatment is
rare in any of the arts. Finally, the theme
of this trilogy in itself commands respect.
There are many still alive who can examine
“The Way Home” as a description of a life
and society that they used to know: they
will find the author prepared for them. The
book is no bow drawn at a venture, but
a secure, historical picture. At worst it
might be considered rather too much like a
historical picture—a little flat and lacking in
atmosphere. Yet taking “The Way Home”
together with its predecessor, we have a solid
achievement in the direction of a background
for Australian life of the present day.
NETTIE PALMER.
Dr. Charles Maclaurin
Jonathan Cape has published the second
volume of Dr. Maclaurin’s Essays tinder the
title of Mere Mortals. A name was difficult
to reach. In the beginning, when the material
was first being got together, “More Post-
mortems” was suggested. But the author
did not like the English plural form. So
that was struck out, and “Autopsy” was sub-
stituted. Naturally. Dr. Maclaurin wanted
the public to read his book, and “Autopsy”
did not seem good from that point of view.
“Mere Mortals” came then as a happy in-
spiration ; and “Mere Mortals” it was and is.
The title was not the only part of the
book that was written and re-written. Dr.
Maclaurin was not fluent. The skeletons of
many of the essays in his two published
books were first printed on the Red Page;
but there is hardly a sentence left in the
original form, and if the author could have
his way with a second edition whole pages
would certainly be re-written. He was never
satisfied with his work. No detective ever
sought evidence more assiduously; no Judge
ever weighed it more carefully. And on
those historical subjects with which he dealt
the evidence is practically inexhaustible. It
was not only that one could always learn
some little thing more about Elizabeth or
Henry VIII., but there was the medical
side of the question also—somebody or other
was always finding out something or other
new about the diseases from which his sub-
jects suffered, or the diseases from which
people who acted as they did probably suf-
fered. He had the true scientist’s passion
for exactitude. If an article of his arrived
on Monday one could be sure that by Satur-
day he would have called or written twice
at least to have this word altered and that
statement modified. No sooner had he sent
the matter for “Mere Mortals” to his pub-
lisher in London than he began to remember
sentences which did not seem to him to convey
the exact shade of meaning he intended; and
his doubts and misgivings mounted and
mounted until finally he cabled asking for
the whole thing back again. It came; the
pen went laboriously through it all; and a
month after the text, revised for the twen-
tieth time, had been posted, Dr. Maclaurin
was grieving that he had let it go out of his
hands without a further revision. Yet he
was not at all vacillating. It was simply
that he hated to appear dogmatic about any
subject concerning which all the possible
evidence was not available. And of course
all the possible evidence never is available —
to one man, at any rate.
Joan of Arc was the first subject he
studied intensively for the purpose of one
of these essays. At that time he had no
thought of making a series of them. His
thought was turned in that direction by
one of his professional jobs—at least the pro-
fessional job helped. Among other things
he was the chief medical officer of the M.L.C.
life-insurance 'office; and the medical and
other records of a case—any case—set him
speculating on the probable effects of this
and that upon th ■> life of the proponent.
From that, to a max of his very wide read-
ing, it was an easy step to a consideration
of the life-histories of outstanding figures
of the past from the point of view of the
medical referee. For this work ‘he was
extraordinarily well equipped. From in-
fancy he had had a serious impedi-
ment which,' as years went on, made
him less and ffiss disposed to join in
conversation; and this drove him to his
books —and he was driven very willingly.
Fortunately his father, the late Chancellor
of Sydney University, had not only a splendid
library, but also a fine system of reference,
so that Charles was encouraged to pursue a
subject from one authority to another. The
good habit never left him; and no father
ever stood higher in a son’s memory.
Apart from his reviews of books for the
Red Page Dr. Maclaurin wrote nothing of
much consequence outside his professional
and semi-professional studies. He tried his
hand at fiction, but with only moderate suc-
cess. One long story at least he wrote; and
for a man who declared that he had little
patience with poetry—the poets were too
inexact —there were some astonishingly good
descriptive passages in it. He had it in hand
for another of the inevitable revisions;
whether that task was ever completed I do
not know.
“Mere Mortals” is “affectionately dedi-
cated to my wife and to my daughter, Mrs.
A. P. Mackerras.” In the one he found, as
lie repeatedly acknowledged, a critic for
whose judgment he had great respect; of the
other, his one child, a graduate of the Uni-
versity. this modest, gentle and utterly un-
affected man was prouder than of anything
else perhaps in the world.

A Theory of Art
Kreisler, during his visit to Melbourne, is
reported to have said: “Art is the product
of an over-ripe culture. It is the latest
manifestation of the progress of a nation.”
From the historical point of view the state-
ment is grotesquely inaccurate. Any person
may, if he so wish, remind Kreisler of Gothic

cathedrals, Homeric poetry, Celtic folk-songs,
and in this way think to refute him. But
the great man is ready with an answer. He
was referring not to the past but to the pre-
sent. He spoke geographically, not histori-
cally. of the world as he knows it of the
world as it is to-day. “The contrast be-
tween this laud and European countries,
he went on to say, “has been softened for
me by my knowledge of Canada and the
United States.” As a result of his study, he
concludes that people in the empty countries,
“pre-oceupied in the struggle to subdue
nature, cannot produce great art.... Space
begets a race of people more simple, more
sullen, than the average, in a state more re-
ceptive of artistic impressions than actually
creative.” But even from the geographical
point of view, we are able to argue against
Kreisler. Vast, empty, agricultural Russia
lias produced some of the greatest creative
artists of our day—Tolstoi, Tcliekov, Tchai-
kowsky, Pavlova. Populous India, Japan,
China can show us no men or women (with
the exception perhaps of Rabindranath
Tagore) to whom Kreisler would be willing
to give the name of artist. The view put
forward by the great violinist is, nevertheless,
of the deepest interest, because it suggests
to us that for Europe at the present day
the artist is “the sophisticated artist, the
technician, the self-conscious artist.”
Europe has once more reached a classical
age. The artists it prefers are townspeople,
interested in the life and doings of towns-
people, anxious to reproduce them in an
appropriate technique. This week I have
been reading two books by Virginia Woolf.
Both were recently issued by the Hogarth
Press, which is not one of the ordinary pub-
lishing houses, but a non-commercial press
directed by Mrs. Woolf and her husband.
One of the books, a novel, is a panegyric
of London. The other is a volume of critical
essays called “The Common Reader.” Essays
and novel throw interesting sidelights upon
each other, upon the London literary atmo-
sphere, and upon Virginia Woolf herself.
The novel, which is not, strictly speaking,
a novel, since there is no plot and but
sketchy characterisation, deals with a well-
to-do married woman of 50, a happy Lon-
doner, who had “lived in Westminster —how
many years now? —over 20. .. . In people’s
eyes, in the swing, tramp and trudge, in the
bellow and the uproar; the carriages, motor-
cars, omnibuses, vans, sandwich men shuffling
and swinging, brass bands, barrel-organs, in
the triumph and the jingle and the strange
high singing of some aeroplane overhead was
what she loved: life, London, this moment
of June.” Unfortunately, she liked very
little else. Love and religion she hated (see
“Mrs. Dalloway,” p. 191), not with the
spiritual fury of a fanatic, but with the un-
easy intolerance of an Alexander Pope. The
fashionable London lady has been made the
heroine of a novel before now. But it is
perhaps safe to say that not since the time
of Queen Anne has she been so candidly
regarded as an ideal.
Ideal woman ! What is more, ideal artist!
The imaginary Mrs. Dalloway is not a
literary woman; she has, in fact, so “few
twigs of knowledge that she does not know
where the Equator is.” But Mrs. Woolf,
her creator, in two of her critical essays
shows us what she believes to be the correct
environment for a writer of fiction. She
reviews the books of Jane Austen and of
Charlotte Bronte. Though she admires both
these writers she is inclined to think them
a little provincial. “But, oh,” she suggests,
“what books might they not have written
had they come to London ; had they, living
in London, been associated with prominent
people and frequented literary drawing-
rooms !”
The point of view is an absurd one. Lon-
don drawing-rooms have given us Thackeray
and Henry James. But they are not good
incubators for novelists. One feels that the
work of such writers as Aldous Huxley,
Maurice Baring, Virginia Woolf, J. C.
Squire, the Sitwells. Stella Benson and Dun-
sany, though pleasing, is sterile. It is as
technically sound, perhaps, as the work of
Dryden, Pope or Addison. But it is a mis-
take to set much store by sophistication.
Kreisler is wrong when he looks on cultured
and leisured persons as the producers. These
people are merely receptive. It is to the
simple people, country folk, artisans, “Col-
onials,” that the world must look for creative
art.

There is in Australia, chiefly in Sydney,
a little school of poetry which flourishes in
spite of hard earth and a neglectful people;
nevertheless it has many qualifications to
justify its being. There are evident faults
of taste and touch; and often enough an idea
is difficult to establish, like the dragon’s egg
buried in the sand, though, perhaps, just as
vital to a future generation. The strange
word, crooked with eld, is stretched upon the
rack and made to scream until the whole
four lines of its containing stanza echo down
the corridors of time. But these are mis-
takes of youth—as a man in the dark, put-
ting out his hand to take a flower, might
first strike upon a knife or a nail. But
be gets the flower in the end. It is the right
spirit, and to he rated far beyond the tame
manipulation of worn-out poetical coin, too
thin to yield even a tiny trickling sound when
set upon a board to rhyme. The writing-
adventurer commands the interests of every-
body, and, although his endeavor be scat-
tered to the winds, yet he pricks upon a
chart the course that he has run, and leaves
his name a glorious star, to be a guide for
mariners unborn.
Man, it has been said, is only immortal
ascending from the heart; everything below
that is reaching towards, and tainted of,
the earth. As we aspire, so we rise nearer
to the gods. In juvenescence it is natural
to adore the flesh, to kiss our sweetheart on
the mouth, to mix with her, to dance, to
drink, to sing along the woods. In maturer
age we toil and find our pleasures climbed
above the breast, until, at length, when lust
is lacking in the loins, the brain begins to
burgeon, and man is to be seen inheriting
the perfectness of life. Thus I am tempted
to argue that our younger school of poets
should be measured, not so much by its pre-
sent achievement as by the promise plainly
pervading the progress of its work. Await-
ing the transition stage, we know these boys,
at least, for lovers of the Muse. Not greedy
of recompense, they open their hearts, with
their books, calling fair Venus to witness
their sincerity in songs, sometimes a little
obscure, but always of honest purpose.

Art in Auckland
The Philistine prevails in all parts of the
earth, but his stronghold is Maoriland.
Surely in no other country are such desecra-
tions committed in the name of Art. One
instance comes from the “Queen City.” The
trustees, under the will of the late Mr. Mac-
kelvie, recently paid some hundreds of pounds
for “Sweethearts and Wives,” by Phil
Morris. Then, anxious to surpass the appa-
rently unsurpassable, they bought at fancy-
prices three pictures from an itinerant
vendor. These treasures are a large Birket-
Foster in oils, a bad Leighton (possibly
spurious), and a repulsive-looking Millais —
there is no doubt as to its being- repulsive,
though there may be some as to its being a
Millais. And this outrage went unnoticed
by most, was defended by many and attacked
by only a few.
It is only typical of the way in which
artistic matters are managed here. The
theatre is perhaps in the worst condition of
all. Amateur productions have hitherto been
merely spasmodic or have quickly degen-
erated into cakes-and-coffee. The commer-
cial drama is in the hands of a few who
seldom vary the tedious fare. The players
are usually old crocks, or brilliantined young
Englishmen with the accent that comes from
Oxford or adenoids; the plays are almost
invariably the pick of the worst of three
countries- —smutty French farce, cheap melo-
drama from England, or bad “crook” plays
from America. Besides being bad artisti-
cally, this policy 7 is also probably bad busi-
ness. A good play, on those rare occasions
when it comes, gets a good audience, for
there are many keen students of the modern
masters. When Professor Shelley spoke in
Auckland on the modern drama, his audience
was large and enthusiastic. For that very
active body the Workers’ Educational Asso-
ciation, J. W. Shaw delivers weekly lectures
on this same subject to a class of some 400.
This enthusiasm had eventually to find
some way of expressing itself. Hence, in
the early half of 1025 there was formed the
Auckland Little Theatre Society—the first
of its kind in the Dominion. Its member-
ship was soon over 400. There were pro-
cured the services of 11. J. Bentley, an actor
of 20 years’ experience, who has played leads
under many great managers. Mr. Bentley
soon had the rehearsals of “Fanny’s First
Play” well on the way, and produced it in
the Operatic Society’s hall for a season of
five nights. The play is poor, but the play-
ers were excellent. In the large cast of 17
there were only three bad performers. There
was nothing crude about the staging, and
there was only one “unrehearsed effect”—
when the curtain went up on three cursing
scene-shifters. The scenery was new and
good: the production, lighting and dressing
were in the hands of experts. Indeed, the
main danger seems to be that of emphasis-
ing the business, rather than the intellectual,
side of the movement. Wilde, Shaw, Milne
and so on are pretty well known even in
M.L. It is to be hoped that later the society
will venture on something more daring.
However, we have at least a glorious
advance on the old position. The next neces-
sity is something in the nature of the Phoenix
Society, to remind us. despite William
Archer, that Shakspeare, Sheridan and Gold-
smith are not the only ones who wrote great
yet actable plays before Pinero. This might
be expected to appeal to the University stu-
dents, but they seem to be dead to cultural
activity. Yet some day, perhaps, there will
be found players to present and audiences
to appreciate such great tragedy as “Dr.
Faustus” or “Death’s Jest Book.” such fine
comedy as “Bartholomew Fair” or “The
Way of the World.”
R. K. M.
A Little Matter of Love
With dissenting self-righteousness, Jack
Lindsay (R.P. 24/9/’25) protests against
my article on Frank Harris’s autobiography;
and then in a tranced, emphatic way com-
mences to put us right on this little matter
of love. We, most of us, thank God, hold
our own views on this subject; and it is
only to bo expected that those of Jack Lind-
say do not agree with those of Frank Harris.
But, apart from this, Jack Lindsay pro-
tests against my “praising” the book “as a
frank sex-revelation”; and I am compelled
to deny the awful impeachment. I certainly
praised the book; I commended its candor; I
said it was a history of sexual development;
I said it contained revelations. But I think
it reveals more about Harris than it does
about sex, as a good biography should. No
one will deny that it is frank—it is even
rank in its frankness. And no one will
deny that it reveals, with uncompro-
mising directness, the sex-life of the author.
This may he thought both sordid and shock-
ing. But Harris is narrating facts concern-
ing himself. He is not creating idealised
abstractions; he is not competing with
Sappho, Wagner or Shakspeare; nor even
writing “Venus’s Penny-dreadful.” And
this is where Jack Lindsay slips on the lurk-
ing banana-skin and dislocates his critical
faculties. He mixes up imagination with
fact, biography with fiction and truth with
enchanting hallucination. In short, he criti-
cises Harris's book as though it were the
Police Gazette in terms of Tristan and
Isolde. lie blames Silenus for not being
Adonis. The fundamental and eternal differ-
ence between Jack Lindsay and Frank
Harris is that the former wants his women
in the Arcadian bowers of bliss, whereas the
latter is more modestly content to have them
in the bedroom.
Judging from his writings, I should say
that Harris doesn’t know anything about
“those dazzled eternities of laughter where
all lovers, from Sappho and Anactoria to
Siegfried and Brunhilde, linger.” Or, if he
does, it is only because he has read about
them. But he does know something about
the passions of ordinary men and women.
He does know something about ordinary mor-
tals who are neither pestered with the
pimples of purity nor subdued by the scle-
roses of vice. He knows their little jeal-
ousies and desires. He knows their fumbling
little intimacies, and all their messing about
witli the lights out. No doubt, he has missed
the whole meaning of that act which Jack
Lindsay assures us can be “translated by
the mind into an eternal realisation of
beauty.” But I don’t think Harris intended
to fly his kite in the breezes of Beauty.
Rather, he took that which came handiest,
and like Bessie, the gypsy, “thought that
love was glorious while it lasted.”

A Satchel of Books
The Free Lovers, by R. W. Kauffman (T, Werner
Laurie). It has none of the art and refinement
of Grant Allen’s shocker of Victorian days, “The
Woman Who Did,” but tells, to the accompaniment
of drink and American slang, a sordid story of the
amours of a worthless youth and a no-better woman,
At the end of a rocky road the precious pair come
to the conclusion that marriage is a desirable estate,
and the reader is left to thankfully wash his hands
of them.
Gaslight and Bromide Printing. G. E. Roberts and
J. Monteith (F. W. Cheshire, Melb.). A very useful
little manual to all who are interested in photo-
graphy. As a rule the amateur acquires knowledge
through dear personal experience. The authors’
design is to enable him to secure good results with-
out this waste and disappointment. The book will
be found of use to the professional also, as it covers
the whole ground from an ordinary snapshot to exhi-
bition prints and high-standard photographs. Half-
tone illustrations add materially to its value.

in to diagnose the case of William Morrow, fortune
builder and victim to invisible wounds. On the walls
of his patient’s study he sees the portrait of a
mother and son, another of the son in American
uniform, still another of the rich man himself; and
then his eyes rest on a vacant space. To fill
that vacant space is to supply the mental specialist
with a cue to the trouble he has been called in
to combat. The author is a skilled writer and
sustains the interest of his story till the problem
is solved.
Architecture (Akt in Australia). The September
number contains, among other matter interesting to
the profession, a suggestion. “The artist in sculpture,
color and line signs his work,” protests the architect;
“why shouldn’t I sign mine?” The custom of
doing so would, it is claimed, improve public inter-
est in a country’s buildings, which express the
life of the people; it is fair to the designer of
a fine piece ot work on the one hand, whilst on
the other it may, by the publication of his respon-
sibilit3% act as a chcclc on the less artistic efforts
of the commercially-minded member. It is suggested
that the signature might take the form of an
engraved plate set in the wall or of a chiselled
kke architects of Britain, the Continent and
U.S.A. are beginning to resort to this practice.

The Great Illusion, by W. E. Graham (Edwards.
Dunlop). The author, a resident of Toowoomba
(Q.), discusses capitalism, socialism and the workers.
He asks three questions; (1) Is the abolition of
the capitalistic system likely to be accomplished
in the future? (2) If so, what will take its place?
(3) Will the community as a whole, and especially
the working classes, be the better or the worse off
for the change? Each of the propositions is dis-
cussed in a judicial spirit and the writer formulates
his conclusion as follows: “What is wanted is not
a change to some new and untried economic and in-
dustrial system, but an earnest endeavor to make
the best of the one that we have to understand its
possibilities, to rid it, so far as we can, of its
injustices, its faults and its weaknesses, and give
it a fair chance, a chance such as it has never
had yet, to show its true worth,” The objects to
be kept before the capitalist he puts in the words
of Henry Ford: “To give the public the best possible

and under the best possible conditions.”
The University of Sydney, by Robert A. Dallen
(University Union). .Over a decade has passed since
the first edition of this work was published, and
au j,| lo r has now brought the material up to date.
ij, be intervening time has been one of great develop-
ment. In many respects the outlook of the uni-
versify of to-day has widened far beyond the pre-
cedents of the old country, taking on some of the
more practical aspects of new-world institutions,
This extension has been largely due to the liberality
benefactQrs and th e wise generosity of Parliament.
The deepest impression left on the mind of the
reader is of the great difference between the old
and new functions of these houses of learning. It
does not seem so 1 0 „ S since William Charles Went-
worth founded the University of Sydney with tjie
vision of rooting in the life of the new community
a sanctuary of the ancient type, for the study of the
humanities in cloistered seclusion. He probably
glimpsed a day when a new Oxford rich in academic
associations, beautiful in form, the home of leisured
learning set in a tranquil atmosphere of widespread
lawns beyond the city’s tumult, would rise upon the
site. To-day the University is girt about by the
bum of busy life. Some of the old spirit may
survive, but the mother has given birth to new inter-
est - new activities, pulsating with the practical life
of the community. The old learning still survives,
newer forces have taken possession. It is
a H reflected in this little work, irom the pictuiesque
colored illustration of the old building in its Gothic
beauty of design to the bare and utilitarian stiuctuies
that house the more modern branches of learning -
a H excellent in their way for the practical purposes
th ey serve ! significant, but inharmonious The book
is profusely illustrated and its material admirably
collected. It should have a place on the bookshelf

Picking Snowdrops.
I have been picking snowdrops in the rain.
If you should come to me now as I stand
I should forget the heartbreak and the pain
And meet you smiling, these within my
hand.
My soul has known a new and lovely birth,
Is purged of storm and stress; for I have
won
A secret from the cool, green-covered earth.
My look shall be the white look of a nun.
I have been picking snowdrops in the rain :
And the wet leaves have laid their touch
on me.
I shall not know such passionate need again—
I that have felt this peace and purity!

The Tale.
The vows men: malce beneath the moon
Are not to bind or hold;
The tale that maidens sweetly tell
When love and moonlight cast their spell
Is but a story told.
You know the lonely road that comes
Across the river winding,
The plover calling in the gums,
Seeking and never finding.
You know how once the old moon rose
And smiled upon the meadow,
Where we were standing, warm and close,
And breathless in the shadow,
While I, as artless as the birds,
Bewitched with moonlight glory,
In modern and unsuited words
Told you an ancient story.
But strange it would have been, my dear,
If with your arms around me,
And both our beating hearts so near,
No gift of speech had found me—
Strange if I had not made to yon
Vows, while we kissed and jested,
Never intended to be true,
Expected to be tested!
Because on such a magic night,
Within her lover’s eyes,
The dullest maid must see alight
The lamps of Paradise!
The coldest damsel could not fail
To give her recitation —-
Her version of the world-old tale—
With such collaboration.
You know—the shelter of your arms:
The misty moonlight streaming;
The lonely and unguessed alarms
That set the plover screaming!
You know —the starry heavens wide;
The reedy flats a-quiver;
The lonely bird that cried and cried,
And ran along the river!
Romance was gaily on the wing.
I said my piece to you
As careless as the birds that sing.
But isn’t it a funny thing.—
Stranger than all imagining —
That such a tale came true?
N.s.w.

Dryope.
What is it ails ye, mournful, wailing leaves,
Hustling and ’plaining like a heart that
•grieves
Over a lonely life or hope long spent
Or some unshriven sin it would repent?
What is it ails ye, beating the sweet air
For sorrow of a lady, lost and fair?
White were her limbs, and slender, soft her
shape
Who from the wrathful gods might not
escape!
Dost thou bewail, O lovely Dryope,
The day thou wast transformed to a tree?
Mournest thou still thy babe and lover bed?
Sweet nymph, the frightened peasants, buf-
feted,
Sheltering against thy heart, forget alarm
Under the warm protection of thine arm!
“Alas!” they sigh, the little leafy boughs,
“Alas! my love, my life, my babe, my vows
Witless I cast away in pleasure’s hour
To pluck a little red-stemmed lotus flower!
Alas ! alas! the blood ran swift and red;
And when I turned, aghast, and would have
fled
Each little, white and shapely-moving foot
Was there become a dreadful horned root!
“The bark closed fast around my shining
thighs;
And I, with pitiful, imploring cries,
Raised arms to Heaven — -‘Boughs! Boughs!
See here, and here!’
Shrieking -my loved ones fled away in fear;
Even my child turned from the sight of me.
Leaving me thus, a tree! A tree! A tree!
Sighing and moaning as ye hear me now
With leafage bound about my eyes and brow!
And I, still living, may not even spread
My shade upon my loves, now long, long
dead.” *
When you shall hear a murmuring in the
leaves
Say not “It is the wind that moans and
grieves.”
Say rather, when the nights are soft and
mild,
“’Tis Dryope’s lone lulling of her child!”
This be thy balm, then, gentle, tortured fay,
That little children under thee shall play!
This for thy comfort, lovely Dryope:
Thou shalt have lovers to eternity!

THE FEDERAL LEOPARD AND HIS
PROPOSED CHANGE OF SPOTS.
The Federal Government has expounded its
policy through the mouth of the Prime Min-
ister, and the verdict is that it is a very
large policy, pervaded with good intentions.
It suggests gentlemanly restraint, considera-
tion for the feelings of others however unde-
serving, courtesy, a desire for harmony and
a tendency to concession; it does not sug-
gest violence, prejudice, or even a stern re-
solve to cut short obstruction and get to
business when Parliament meets again, if it
ever does meet. There is room for a linger-
ing suspicion that it may not, and that some
kind of Soviet may turn up instead. The
situation is that in two States, Westralia
and Queensland, covering much more than
half the Commonwealth, acts of insurrection
have become commonplace. The Federal
Governments mails have been interrupted.
Its officials have been prevented, with threats
<>t drowning or other rude acts, from doing
their duty. When its law was put into effect
against certain offenders to the extent of
brief sentences of imprisonment, State poli-
ticians released the offenders. The K.C. who
represents the central authority before its
own Deportation Board can't force ft civil
answer from recalcitrant Witucssbfe. Its
Arbitration Courts Uftve no powet to enforce
their decisions* ftn'd have been in that condi-
tion all through the Bruce-Page period. The
Ministry has been promised, by no less a
person thail the leader of the Senate Opposi-
tion* that it will be forcibly put aboard ship
and sent into exile, without any form of
legal trial. The Commonwealth has no
Criminal courts of its own, no gaols and no
police, barring some two dozen men, and the
Prime Minister indignantly denied the pos-
session of more, as if police were a cause of
shame. Outside Canberra and the Northern
Territory, it has no legal right to protect the
people by military force from gross in-
jury except at the request of some State
Government which probably foments the in-
jury. Altogether the situation is one which
might rouse some Prime Ministers to anger,
even if anger, is a rather futile emotion.
* * *
The policy formulated in these remarkable
conditions is extensive. It is proposed to
find another £20,000,000, which is to be lent
out to people of small means, at tow .interest
and for long terms, for the erection Of homes.
Previous large ventures in the home construc-
, tion line have led to much infuriated criti-
cism, but future ones may prove better —or
worse. Dissension and conspiracy are also
to be combated with a £3,000,000 loan to the
States tor the purchase of wire-netting. It
is planned to do something Federal and com-
prehensive in the way of “social insurance,”
adding unemployment insurance to the old-
age and invalidity pension system. Child
endowment is mentioned as coming, hut a
little further off. Federal and State Arbitra-
tion Judges are to be invited to put their
heads together and see if working hours can
be made uniform throughout the Common-
wealth. As the 44-liour States are large,
and as their Governments are short-tempered
and have a brief way with public officials
who don't give satisfaction, the getting of
these functionaries into one apartment will
probably lead to nothing—or else to an order
that the 48-hour States shall leave off work
earlier. The cotton industry, which is mostly
a Queensland affair, is to be helped with a
direct bonus, just as the cane-sugar industry,
likewise mostly a Queensland concern, lias
been helped by a monopoly of the market
and a fixed price. Westralia, which is an-
other troublesome proposition, is promised
£450.000 as one year’s instalment of its pro-
posed annuity to go on with. Tasmania’s
prospective share of the good things that are
going js merely a prospect of better shipping
facilities in part of the tourist season, or
rather permission to look for better facilities.
South Australia is once more assured tenta-
tively of a narrow-gauge railway to Alice
Springs as an instalment of the whole-way
railway in consideration of which it sur-
rendered the Northern Territory over 14
years ago. Some aspirations for a uniform
gauge and certain projects for better defence,
pending the millennium of disarmament, are
not very large, but are commendable.
* * * *
It is a lavish programme: hut the accom-
plishment of even a modest bit of it depends
on the Government’s capacity to deal with
the budding Revolution, for Communism isn’t
to be bought off with benefits of any sort.
On this subject the Prime Minister’s speech
was stern and frequent, but vague. It is
intended to “defeat the nefarious designs of
extremists,” “to pass effective legislation to
deal with offences against the peace of the
Commonwealth,” and so on, and much more
to the same effect. As concrete instances, the
Federal Conciliation and Arbitration Courts
are to be presided over by full-sized Judges,
appointed for life, and with judicial autho-
rity to enforce their awards. If they de-
pend on State police and State gaolers in the
last resort, the enforcement may possibly
fall flat. Then strikes are to be minimised
by a new rule demanding a secret ballot of the
union and a majority vote before the stoppage
can legally take place. It is a commonsense
proposal : yet if the stoppage takes place
illegally, matters may not be so materi-
ally changed, after all. The whole situation
might be altered if some strenuous Federal
Government devoted itself to taking over
and administering to the full, by means of
Federal courts, all the unused and dormant
powers which the Constitution gives it
authority to use. Then the importance of
little State Premiers like Collier, who defy
the Commonwealth law while holding out
a hat for Commonwealth alms, would be
enormously diminished, and that of the
Federal authority correspondingly increased.
The latter would be in evidence everywhere,
whereas it is now hardly visible anywhere.
A giant, however somnolent, isn’t attacked
quite so casually as a somnolent dwarf or
a sleeping germ, and even the patience of a
Bbtjce couldn’t make such an enlarged cen-
tral authority of no account. Unfortunately
there is no promise in the Prime Minister’s
programme of an intention to be up and
doing in this direction, or half-way up. The
assurance given is merely that if the Minis-
try comes back with the legislative chances
that it has failed to use during 12 months
of turmoil, then the leopard will change his
spots. There being an exceedingly limited
choice of leopards, the only course is to
encourage the present animal with all the
support possible, and hope that the day of
miracles is still here.

THE GOSPEL ACCORDING TO
MATTHEW.
Last month desire of battle took Matthew
Charlton, the Federal Labor-leader, by the
throat, and warlike words issued from a
pacifist mouth. “I challenge Mr. Bruce to
do the manly thing and go to the country at
once,” lie said to a reporter. The challenge
was several times repeated, the challenger
signifying on one occasion that ho greatly
admired the courage he was displaying. But
the gage having been taken up and the elec-
tion fixed for November 14, Matthew
Charlton’s courage seems to have oozed
out of him. Last week he querulously
objected that liis opponent was appealing to
the people before there was any heed: ’Mil
my opinion,’’ he bleated, “most of tile people
will be greatly surprised at flit- reasons for
dissolving Parliament Which the Priirie Minis-
ter has put forth.” This dtoil change of
aftittidjj is probably due to the fact that the
good Charlton, whose political life, as a
rule, is cloistered and sheltered, has been
going about a bit since the dissolution and
learning what plain people really think of
the Federal Labor party and the Red
wreckers, its friends. For the last 12 months
there has been an unbroken succession of
transport strikes, most of them lawless
(since registered agreements were torn up)
and ali destructive, and not once has the
Federal Labor party stood up for the observe
a nee of contracts or taken the people's side:
On the contrary, it has boisterously eliani-
pioned the alien leaders of the Wi'eckefS, hud;
while professing to believe' iu “complete
Australian seif-govfernhient,” ahgfil-y denied
that Australia has any right to send them
back to the countries they Came ffom: it lias
also espoused tile cause Of the British Seamen
who struck in defiance Of their Own iinidn,
and whose refusal to man tile hoat§, Or to
let. Others than tlibnfi has. already inflicted
serious ilijury Oh Australia, which lias no
meaus Of removing their grievances, and
thfeateiis thousands of Australian unionists
with loss of employment. And there arc
signs that even electors who usually vote
Labor have reached the fed-up stage.
A consciousness of this fed-up feeling sat
heavily on Charlton when he was struggling
with his policy speech. The effort in ques-
tion was dispirited in manner and matter.
There was the familiar pledge of “co-opera-
tion with the State Governments in an en-
deavor to break up the big' estates” which
were to have been broken up by the Federal
Labor land-tax iti 1010. A Rural Credits
branch of the Commonwealth Bank whs
likewise promised (it has already been pro-
vided for), as also were “a comprehensive
system of water conservation hud irriga-
tion,” the “provision of moi'C up-to-date
methods of marketing our products, both
locally and overseas,” the extension of the.
strike-ridden and insolvent Commonwealth
Government Shipping Line “fot tile purpose
of securing cheaper freights,” Mid Other thill
old friends. National insurance, mother-
hood endowment, compulsory Wheat pools,
Commonwealth agricultural-implement, fac-
tories “to provide .primary producers
with cheaper machinery,” and numerous other
boons Wei'e offered in addition without any
indication as to how they were to be
financed—taxation was a subject which
Charlton dodged. And one or two strik-
ing changes of policy were announced in be-
tween tedious repetition of the old stuff.
“The Labor party,” said its leader, “will
prize self-determination, not merely for itself
but as the heritage of all men in all lands.”
Then the Labor party will presumably accord
the right of secession to Tasmania and West-
ralia, for self-determination and secession
are the same thing. When the present year
was young Federal Labor voted against the
construction of the two 10,000-ton cruisers
on the ground that a disarmament scheme
might be arranged in Washington or Geneva.
Construction having been decided upon, it
denounced the Government up hill and down
dale for not getting the job done in Aus-
tralia. Now its leader says, in effect, that
it is against cruiser construction even in the
Commonwealth, since Australia could get
16 submarines or 468 battleplanes (at least
someone has said so) for the cost of one
cruiser! This bewildering statement was
preceded by some ponderous remarks about
industry:—
Australian Labor stands for the establishment and
expansion of industry in all its forms. Industry
upon Australian soil is subject to Australian laws
and conditions. It furnishes the people with a
variety of occupations, augments the internal pro-
duction of wealth, increases the number of people
employed, and furnishes an ever-increasing local
market for the consumption of local products.
There was a lot more of this copybook stuff
but wliat the public wanted instead was a
plan for keeping the wheels of industry
moving in spite of the Walshes, Johan-
sons and Caseys, who stop them with
impunity and with disastrous success.
Charlton had no plan, nor did he say
anything to indicate that a Charlton
Government (if such a calamity can be
imagined) would not exhibit, in an ampler
field and with even more dangerous conse-
quences, the same humble submission to
mobs of work-stoppers that the Gillies
Government has displayed in Queensland
and the Collier Government in Westralia.
* * * *
There were other noteworthy omissions.
In view of the frequent assertion that the
Labor party has no connection with Com-
munism, people would have liked to know
why the said party went to Moscow for its
“objective”—the socialisation of industry,
production, distribution and exchange—and
for the idea of a “supreme economic council”
to control nationalised industries, name and
all. They would likewise have been charmed
to learn what is meant by “the constitutional
utilisation of industrial and Parliamentary
machinery,” and whether it is “constitu-
tional” to hold up Commonwealth Govern-
ment steamers, State Government railway
trains and the mails, to say nothing of
privately-owned goods. And seeing that
there have been sinister threats as to what
will happen if Australia deports Walsh
and Johanson, as America deported Jim
Larkin and Emma Goldman, it would have
been at least interesting to be furnished
with a reason for the inclusion in the new
Labor Defence “policy” of the clause speci-
fying that the volunteer whose officers are
to be chosen on selection-ballot principles is
to retain the nation’s lethal weapons. But
none of these mysteries did Charlton
elucidate.

THE COMING AGE.
If the history of the past gives any true indi-
cation of the history of the future—that is
to say, if history really does repeat itself —
it would seem, apart from any other indica-
tions to a like effect, as if the day of the
Bolshevik is dawning over the civilised
world. Human civilisation seems to advance
in cycles. Each cycle is divided into three
ages, which might be Palled dark, golden and
ted. The golden follows tlie datk. the fed
the golden. Tiieii (iOmh andtiief dark agii
:ind the beginning Of a iiiiW cjrclfe. A iieW
i’bligibn begins as a socialistic
based on emotional humanism. It is always
inaugurated in a,red age. and always in-
augurates a dark age. When it in time
ceases to be a socialistic system; when the
fervor of it cools down and is no longer its
driving and governing force; when the brain
man takes control in place of the emotional
man, then science and art come into their
own; civilisation advances in leaps and
bounds; the golden age begins. But the
golden age Is of necessity a freedom-spread*
ing age, and the spread , of freedom, means
the greater demand for freedom: foil us the
golden age turns grad 1 1 ally red—like the
setting .still; . The fed age always foretells
the pbming bf d dark age td the wbfld:
Christianity began aS ,ii socialistic sftiteiti
based bii dii btabtibhal iiiimaniSni: It Was
all .fob the Ittwly and the igudfaiit anti dll
against t.lie governing clashed and tlie re-
ligions Of its time;, In all probability the
pagan religions, that it ultimately conquered
and superseded began ages before in the
same way. Now Bolshevism comes as a
socialistic system based on emotional human-
ism. It, too, is all for the lowly and the
ignorant and all against Capitalism and the
Church. Naturally the churchman will pro-
test that Christianity is vastly different
from Bolshevism. Present-day Christianity
undoubtedly is; but, then, present-day Chris-
tianity is vastly different from the Christian-
ity that once swept the civilised world like
a mighty fire. That Christianity was aflame
with u fervor that present-day Christianity
in the main utterly lacks: And it lacked ill
turn, and did not, put ally value upon; the
culture, the wealth, the material, beauty to-
wards which tlie. modern Cjiifistiffh Church

slieyiSm’S.great menace tB tlie world. Early
Christianity Was OindtiOnai. ndt logical. Bdl-
sliffviem is Wholly emotional, tOO, and never
logical. And emotion moves the multitude;
never the thought that comes from the wise
man's brain.
Professor Gilbert Murray in his book
“Five Stages of Greek Religion” says of
early Christianity that it had a “subter-
ranean power, a humanity, a brotherhood
within its bounds, a care for the poor, and
a comparative indifference to the virtues of
a governing class —statesmanship, modera-
tion, truthfulness, active courage, learning,
culture, public spirit.” These words would
easily pass as a description of Bolshevism
as it is to-day. To the average intelligent
man Bolshevism is ugly, coarse, brutal, and
much inferior in every way to the Church
and the national constitution that it would
destroy and replace. So undoubtedly must
Christianity have appeared to the governing
classes of the day in which it came. It cer-
tainly lacked the culture, refinement, beauty
of the Olympian religion that It destroyed.
And it conquered not because of any
goodness and beauty in it. but because of
the emotional fervor in it that grew and
gathered power to itself just at the time when
the emotional fervor of the older religions
had almost died out. And once in power it
kept in power by employing much the same
methods as the Bolshevik in Russia employs
at the present time.
If the_ Bolshevik could reason he would
see that in, any hundred of his followers
he had an incipient capitalistic State. That
is to say, as the ages Wear on and the fervor
of the movement dies out, the descendants
of this hundred will be tradesmen, church
people, artists, business magnates. It is
exactly what happened with Christianity.
The time came when it ceased altogether to
be a fervor-fired socialism. It became aristo-
cratic and wealthy, with a serving class kept
disciplined and hopeful by the Christianity
the Church preached but ceased to practise.
Then gradually the governing-class virtues
formed, and a revival of culture and learning
took place; a golden age began to dawn. But
if a dark age means the expression of, and
then the gradual dying out of, the once sup-
pressed emotional energy of the lower classes,
so a golden age means the expression of and
then the gradual dying out of the so-long sup-
pressed intellectual energy of the upper classes.
Professor Murray points out how this “fail-
ure of nerve” was on the governing classes of
Rome at the time Christianity came. Fol-
lows ever in the train of this nerve-failure a
sense of sin and humility. There comes sen-
timentality, frivolity, craving for excitement;
then ultimate weakness, lack of any lasting
enthusiasm for anything—degeneracy. The
governing classes of Rome looked on, power-
less to *move and apparently almost indiffer-
ent. while the agitator grew ever more bold,
and the emotional socialism that afterwards
became Christianity, and that they knew
must oust all that they valued most highly,
began to spread as a fire spreads through
bracken on a summer’s day.
To-day there certainly are symptoms of
nerve-failure in the governing class. And it
certainly does seem as if the control of affairs
is falling into the reaching hands of the
far more enthusiastic—-the long-suppressed
ignorant and emotional. We are living in
a red age. The question is, how far off is
the next age, the dark age, that the red age
in the past has always foretold? And what
can be done to push it back? To me it seems
that the realisation of what threatens is
the first thing necessary.

PLAIN ENGLISH.
Australia’s Family Maintenance Bill.
One of the several disabilities suffered by
Tasmanians from inter-State Freetrade is the
necessity for meeting' increased competition
from mainland firms. Travelling salesmen
from Melbourne and Sydney arc every year
scooping more and more of the business which
formerly stayed with Tas. merchants. What,
troubles the Tas. merchant is the fact that,
while he has to operate under the immediate
supervision of the local income-tax officers,
and must pay local rates, his mainland com-


petitor goes practically scot free. Certainly
the increased trade prosperity of the main-
land manufacturing cities helps to provide
a better market for Tas. farm products, but
a harried Speck storekeeper, finding Ins trade
slipping away across the Straits, cannot be
expected to take much comfort from a little
thing like that. Besides, though new pianos
from Melbourne may set every spud-farm m
the district on a joyful jazz, the local shop-
keeper’s concern about his overdraft pre-
cludes his hearty co-operation in the revels.
Instead, he foregathers with Ins kind and
talks hopelessly about secession and forms
himself into Taxdodgers Associations,
Traders’ Unions or State Rights Leagues,
and denounces Walsh and Bruce and Arbi-
tration Courts and Navigation Acts, and
writes letters to the papers advocating the
flogging or deportation of persons so unpatri-
otic as to patronise foreign (meaning main-
land) manufacturers or merchants instead
of the pure Tasmanian article. It is all very
natural, and very futile and illogical. las-
mania’s low taxable capacity (less than bU
per cent, of the Commonwealth average)
and necessarily high proportionate tax bur-
den, with loss of population and loss of trade,
is caused, not by unfair competition under
inter-State Freetrade, but by the simple
fact that the State is a small and geographi-
cally isolated portion of the family estate.
Navigation, arbitration, customs tariff, with
all the faults of each taken for granted, are
part of Australia’s Protective policy, for
which all Australians must be prepared to
pay, whether they live at Broome, Bunda-
berg, Bourke, Barrier, Bendigo or Brum.
If the policy suits tlxe majority of Australian
citizens it will stand: it cannot be changed
merely because a minority in the outlying
States find it rather less beneficial and more
burdensome to them than to the larger or
more populous provinces of the Common-
wealth. That certain States would sufter
disabilities under Federation has always been
realised. Canada, the U.S.A. and Australia
herself have accepted the inevitability of
those disadvantages, and have accorded them
financial recognition by special grants to
necessitous members of the Federal family.
It is all a question of the amount of special
subsidy justly payable by the more fortunate
members to the disadvantaged ones. I hat
amount having heen ascertained by an impar-
tial tribunal (the chief statistical officials
in each State might form a permanent Board
on State Disabilities), prompt payment
should follow as a matter of course, and
without recourse to wordy wranglmgs or
party wire-pullings in Parliament. It should
be frankly recognised in Australia, as it is
in Canada and U.S.A., that certain States
are entitled to special consideration on
account of special disabilities as members
of the Federation. That the government of
a small or sparsely populated State costs
proportionately more than that of a big popu-
lous State is obvious. It is equally obvious that
the same standard of living must be main-
tained by all members of the family—-there
can be no “pobr relations” attitude tolerated
in a democratic Federation, no assumption of
superiority and no sacrifice of dignity.
Canada makes a substantial ‘‘allowance to-
wards cost of government” to the provinces,
said allowance being based on needs and not
on population, and of course varying in
amount in different provinces. The Dominion
also pays a subsidy per head of population
to the provinces, the subsidy decreasing as
the population increases. There have been
also special subsidies to certain provinces.
Prince Edward Island, with 89,000 popula-
tion, receives treble the per capita grant
allotted to British Columbia (pop. 525,000),
and Alberta (the youngest member ot the
family) collects nearly four times as much
per head from the Dominion Government tor
her 600,000 people as Ontario for each et
her 3,000,000 inhabitants. The U.S.A. sub-
sidies to States also vary; some ot the
Western States receive four times the per
capita allowance made to the older New
England States. It is understood that the
Speck’s Disabilities Committee will shortly
report in favor of a varying payment by the
Commonwealth instead of the present fixed
per capita 255. (with special grants on occa-
sion to Westralia and Tas.). It seems the only
fair and handy way to get over the difficulty
and put an effective stop to the undignified
squabbling and scrambling among the mem-
bers of the household as to their respective
share of the necessary food and raiment.

Strike Picketing.
The Bruce Government is going to se ®
there are no strikes without a secret ballot
of the unionists concerned. The chances are
that even without such legislation there
would be precious few strikes, and what
few there were wouldn’t last long, it the
common law relating to intimidation was oi,
rather, could be enforced. Because of its pre-
sent non-enforcement a dozen or two men
can prevent hundreds from taking the work
they Avan t to take, for the simple reason that
the hundreds don’t go along in a body. I ic-
keting is legal; but the picket has no right
to go to scores of places where lie does
go, and lie has no right to use the threats
that everybody knows he does use. And
since it does not seem possible to stop him
from using those threats, and for other rea-
sons, the time has come when picketing
ought to be made illegal altogether. Ihe
old argument was that the picket should be
entitled to intercept men 'who were going
to a job, tell them a strike Avas on, and,
Avitliout using threats of violence or inti-
midation, attempt to persuade them to join
the strikers. Only moral suasion might
legally be used; the line draivn between what
is arid what is not permissible is quite
rigid. But who beliei’es that that sort of appeal
is used nowadays? Recently in Sydney it Avas
announced that the British seamen who are
on strike against the British Seamen s Union
had posted pickets at various points, includ-
ing one so remote from the city waterfront
as Athol Bay. The frankly-stated intention
Avas to “spot” any man who might be dis-
covered going aboard any of the laid-up ves-
sels. They didn’t want to “spot” him in
order to argue with him, using only moral
suasion: they wanted to intimidate him,
to frighten him from any attempt at going
aboard, and to let him knoAV that if he did
go aboard his name would be taken and he
would be a marked man and subject to the
little delicate attentions that could be stored
up for him. If Bruce’s ballot were taken and
a majority voted against a strike, exactly what
has been happening in Australia could happen
again and again. For the British seamen s
strike is quite an unauthorised affair. It has
been pursued in the teeth of the big unions
official instructions. It has been continued omy
because picketing, once harmless enough and
perhaps necessary, has been permitted to
continue, though it is no longer harmful
and though it is no longer necessary. I here
are almost hourly papers now to tell union-
ists and others of what is happening; and
men don’t need pickets to meet them in dark
places to argue with them as to the rights
and wrongs of a strike. So picketing ought
to go. If it doesn’t’go Bruce’s ballot will
soon be laughed at.
How Dives Tries to Get at Lazarus for
a Trifle.
In Australia the supreme bluff of the day is
the demand of Westralia to be further
“compensated,” on a big. scale, at the charge
of its neighbors, including poor little las-
inania, for its alleged losses through
tion ; indeed, liberal “compensation has
been recommended, while the distressed
island can get the loan of hardly anybody s
official ear. One probable reason is that
Tasmania, being less than one per cent, ot
the Commonwealth in size, is never likely
to have much more voting power to sell than
it has now, while Westralia, being over oi j
per cent, of the Federal area, may. easily
have a great deal. Besides, Tasmania is a
law-abiding place, which doesn’t run chronic
insurrections, and hold up ships, and threaten
to throw Commonwealth Customs and quar-
antine officials into the sea. There are
Ministries which give less than justice it
they aren’t kicked, and more than justice if
they are kicked hard enough, and the pre-
sent Federal one may be of that sort. Of
the three Commissioners whom it sent to
Perth, two proposed that Westralia should
receive, at the cost of its neighbors, including
Tasmania, £450.000 a year pending the time
when it might be allowed to set up a tariff
of its own. The third proposed a grant of
£3,000,000 by ten annual instalments, with
a prospect of renewal. The most tangible
reason assigned for these proposals is that
Westralia is in a poor way. as evidenced by
the “drift of population, either migrants or
native-born,” to other parts. On this sub-
ject the Commonwealth Statistician gives
his estimate as follows : —•

According to the official estimates Tasmania’s
population started to show an absolute de-
crease at the end of 1923. The drop in 1924
was set down as 1235. and for the first
quarter of 1925 as 3503. The preliminary
estimate for the second quarter is to much
the same effect, and the people begin to call
it a “landslide.” On the other hand,' the
West seems to be prospering in the popula-
tion way. Tasmanians are a hardworking
crowd. The Westralian factory-worker de-
mands a higher wage than the one in any
other State, and produces the least value in
output, while the island man toils for the
lowest wage and shows a considerably
greater output. The State railways in the
Golden West yielded, at last returns, £4 18s.
per cent, on the capital invested, which was
ISs. above the Commonwealth average, while
the island lines paid 11s. per cent., or £3 9s.
per cent, below the average. Tassy tried
to honestly square its accounts by taxing its
people to the extent of £3 6s. 6d. per inhabi-
tant per annum, which means that, out of its
poverty, it collected exactly up to the Com-
monwealth average, Westralia charged its
well-paid folk £2 17s. 6d. per inhabitant,
which was 9s. below the average, and the
lowest tax figure of all. Yet big Dives
threatens to secede if he doesn’t get a hand-
some subsidy, partly at the expense of little
Lazarus! Incidentally, the pair are both
in receipt of a little aid already, the latest
available figures for a complete year being
£130,000 for Dives and £85,000 for Lazarus.
Nothing is really settled yet about future
help, but in his speech at Dandenong Prime
Minister Bruce proposed that Westralia
should get a first annual instalment of
£450,000. to give time for still further in-
quiry. For Tasmania it is suggested that in
periods when the tourist traffic is inadequately
catered for under the restrictions of the
Navigation Act, casual vessels may. be per-
mitted to assist—provided the sluggish Gov-
ernment realises in time that more vessels
arc required and shipowners care to take on
casual jobs of such very little promise, and
assuming that the regulation strike doesn’t
intervene. The cheque for Dives seems sure
enough; it isn’t nearly so certain that
Lazarus will get any relief this season.

A “Strong” Man Speaks.
Apropos of the late Queensland Govern-
ment railway strike and its development into
a Soviet victory, it is quite unfair to place
the entire responsibility on the shoulders ot
Gillies and his spineless Ministry. The
seeds of this revolution were planted quite
a number of years ago by alleged strong men
—Premiers Ryan and Theodore. On every
occasion when the embattled unions put
up a demand on these “leaders” the re-
sult was always a tardy or speedy compli-
ance —more often speedy than tardy. Theo-
dore would talk in terms of academic
approval concerning the need for immigra-
tion, for instance, but he never dared put
his theories into effect. One crack of the
whip and lie was all submission. For the
present calamitous condition of Queensland
with regard to its public “servants” Theo-
dore is more to blame than any other man.
He it was who accomplished the grand coup
whereby the public “servants” were placed
under the Arbitration Court. This was done
simply that the Labor Government might
dodge the responsibility of having to refuse
demands for increased wages and reduced
hours, thereby alienating votes, or of grant-
ing these same demands and thereby landing
the Treasury in enormous deficits. It was
pure moral cowardice that made Theodore
adopt a course oi which the weakest of the
old Tory Governments would never have
dreamed. Immediately the railwaymen came
under the Court they commenced to clamor
for every kind of concession and increase.
For some years the Court was _ com-
pliant, the annual railway deficit of
£1,250.000 or thereabouts notwithstand-
ing ; but the moment the tribunal com-
menced to demur to these demands, over-
board went industrial arbitration. The day
public “servants” came under the Court the
Ministry surrendered control of the public
service, of the Treasury, and of the right
to determine taxation. Yet when the strike
of which Theodorism was a prime cause
broke out, and the sugar farmers whom
Theodore aspires to represent in the Com-
monwealth Parliament wanted to know
whether he had anything to propose, the
great strong man is reported to have said
that it was no concern of his. “The position
does not interest me” are the words attri-
buted to him, and even his erstwhile col-
league Fiiielly joined in the jeers.
O
A Canned-Horse Industry.
Dear Bulletin,—-Ileccnt statistics quote
Queensland’s population as over 800,000, and
the number of horses as over 700,000 —well
on towards one horse per inhabitant, in these
motor times, too. The State has thousands
of horses that do nothing but worry their
owners and their neighbors. Many cattle-
stations have anything from 200 to 1000
where 50 would be ample. Should anybody
mention horses to the owner or manager, he
will spit contemptuously and say they are
rubbish and ought to be shot. One owner,
who had about 150 horses in a yard, waved
his hand and said they would not bring £1
per head in a salcyard or on the place, lie
doubted whether half of them would be sold
at any price, and asked me what was the
use of importing high-priced stallions from
the South. I at once asked him to put a
price on a certain brown gelding, and also
on a bay. x\fter hard thinking he remarked
that those particular two he had been watch-
ing for some time, and he could not possibly
let them go under a tenner each. It is
almost invariably the same. Let an owner
see you are interested in a certain animal,
and its value suddenly leaps skyward. This
sort of thing goes on everywhere, and the
holding becomes eaten out by mobs that easily
get out of hand. A number die from
old age. accidents and so on, and a number
“go bush” and stay there, probably to de-
velop into brumbies ; but the majority remain
on the holding to eat precious grass and stir
up precious water. Why not can the super-
fluous animals V There is surely a largo
enough horse-eating population in Europe
to justify a trial shipment. It is possible
that beef-canning companies would shy at
any proposal to use their works for treating
horses; and it might be reasonably argued
that Australia would run a risk of losing
her good name for canned meats if horses
were potted. But every project has its risks,
notwithstanding the earnest statements one.
sees on prospectuses. In any case, judicious
propaganda, coupled with careful advertising
and management, should, forestall any dan-
gerous notion that Jacques Crapaud or
Hans Blutwurst might acquire. I am of
opinion that those who would eat our sur-
plus horses would not at any time be buyers
of our beef, except in a very small way, so
we would have a brand-new industry. If horse-
flesh went into the poorer homes only, we
would naturally expect a lower price for it
than that obtained for beef. The point is
that we have thousands of tons of horseflesh
to sell, and we are prepared to sell under
beef prices. It is not probable that beef
prices would be affected at all. Opposition
to the scheme would possibly come from beef-
owners (who are in many cases large horse-
owners also), but a company might be formed
to prosecute the scheme. There would be
by-products, of course, such as hair, hides,
bones and oils. Every station where horses
are bred can show a percentage of unfits —-
horses that are blemished or cripples or are
nondescripts, though none the less healthy.
They are unfit for use as stock-horses, and
are certain rejects at horse-sales except at
occasional prices verging on the absurd. All
these could go into the cannery. It is pro-
bable that some right-thinking person will
rise and denounce the idea because (it is
said) Australia loves its horse too much to
tolerate thousands of them being der-riven
to the shambles, to be slain by a caitiff with
a long-handled napping hammer. Make a
market and give enough vulgar money, and
many a fat steed that now does nothing but
mock its owner will head for Europe with
pretty labels round sections of it. We would
keep our best animals to use as stock-horses
and to sell to Army buyers, and the Aus-
tralian horse would once again become
famous as an animal to ride and to stay up
under the rider at the end of a long day,
pursuing either stock or an enemy, We
do not want the culls or cast-offs. The pro-
portion of inferior horses to really good ani-
mals is appalling. Good horses make a good
stockman a better one. Bad horses are bad
property at any time. Eaten out of a can,
a man-eating, brumby would taste quite as
nice as Heroic would. Sentiment is right
enough, but it should not stand in the way
of a new and apparently necessary industry.
What economic waste it is to breed and graze
many thousands of horses yearly for no other
purpose than to let them mature and die
unused! —Yours, S. C. O. Jessop.
The Absentee Strike.
The British marine strike is now an
absentee strike, having died out in Britain,
where it never lived to any great extent,
and hanging out its exiled shingle, or the
remains thereof, in Australia, Maoriland and
South Africa. Curious aspects attach to it.
The main strength of the upheaval has lain
in Australia, where imported Communists
organised it, acting in conjunction with
Emanuel Siiinwell in the Cold Country.
Shin well was born of a Russian Jew
father and a Dutch mother, and claims Lon-
don as his birthplace. Some enemies assert
that he first saw the light in Dublin, but
doesn’t want to appear as a subject of the
Irish Free State, which has rather violent
ways with Communists, He got into Purlin-
ment for the Scottish mining town of Lin-
lithgow by 3632 majority in 1922, owing to
the anti-Labor vote being split. He got out
by 642 minority in 1924. Though a land-
lubber and a tailor, he organised the Amal-
gamated Marine Workers’ Union, which is
claimed to have 10,000 members, though 630
votes were sufficient to re-elect Siiinwell
last time. This runs a sort of “scab” oppo-
sition to Havelock Wilson’s Sailors and
Firemen’s Union with a membership of
about 100,000. It is alleged that a considerable
proportion of the strikers belong to Shin-
well’s side-show, and that another propor-
tion are. not unionists at all. One way and
another Premier Collier of Westralia, who
has helped the strike along with such cheery
recklessness that oversea ships propose to
abandon his State, seems to have plunged
into dubious company. He recently issued a
stern denial of the fact that strikers rushed
the s.s. Demodocus and drove the unwilling
crew ashore while his police looked on, and
lie used very lofty language about ‘ political
propaganda.” Soon after this the serious
nature of the situation drove him to convene
the Fremantle Laborites and waterside
workers and entreat them not to let the
fact which didn’t happen occur again, for
the row was becoming audible.

The Italian in the North.
The Italian immigrant continues his peace-
ful penetration policy in Queensland’s sugar
area. He has already advanced as far south
as the Mackay district, where the imme-
diate objective appears to be the fertile tract
which feeds the Marian mill. Several farms
have already been sold to Italians in that
neighborhood, and further transfers were
only prevented by the decision of the local
A W U. that “no cane from any farm pur-
chased by any Southern European after
August 31 last will be handled by the mills.
Whether the authority to enforce such a
decision is vested in the local union re-
mains to be seen. But, certainly, if the
figures given at the mass meeting of Mackay
unionists on September 30 are correct (it
was stated that of the 203,000 acres of sugar-
land in Queensland 100,000 acres are owned
by Italians, apart from leases and land
owned by other Southern Europeans), the
occasion calls for thought. The situation is
one of the utmost delicacy. The Italian is
a good colonist, being in the mam sober and
law-abiding. He is also an industrious and
intelligent agriculturist. But, as America
has discovered, the Italian cn masse does
not assimilate. Scattered families through-
out the empty agricultural districts ot
Queensland would doubtless prove an asset.
But the sugar area is emphatically not one
of Australia’s empty spaces. It is, m fact,
a fully-occupied and restricted area—re-
streted owing to present over-production. It
is idle therefore in this connection to talk
of the Southern European carrying out the
development of the country which the A us-
tralian lias shirked. It is easy enough to
perceive the point of view of the producer
who, badgered and hectored by continual
senseless strikes aud the ever-rising cost
of production, grasps the opportunity to sell
to the foreigner at a still figure. But it is
none the less a shortsighted policy and poor
patriotism. The abolition of Kanaka labor
on the plantations in the old days
resulted ill cases of individual loss and hard-
ship ; but who will doubt its ultimate wis-
dom V Men of vision have continually to
sacrifice immediate personal gain to an
ideal, and the domination of the sugar areas
by men of our own standards of living and
wavs of thinking is an ideal worth fighting
for. About the year 1908 the vmeyardists
in the grapelands of Fresno, California, were
faced with a series of industrial difficulties.
Pickers were scarce and wages high, and tlie
price of raisins was down. At the oppor-
tune moment a suave Japanese gentleman
stood at each farmer’s elbow offering to take
his vineyard off his hands on sale or lease.
The majority succumbed. California and
America are'still paying the price of their
shortsightedness. The Italian is not an
Oriental. He is. nevertheless, untroubled
bv n standard of living such as the Austra-
lian knows; also, the less English lie
acquires and the more he keeps to himself
the easier it is for him to evade our indus-
trial awards. No one who has watched the
tracts of virgin scrub transformed into fields
of waving cane, and the two-roomed shack
in which a little family have cnduicd thcli
initial hardships replaced by a tidy veran-
dalied homestead with a garden and perhaps
a tennis-court and other modest amenities
of life, can contemplate with equanimity the
prospect of our sugar area resolving itself
into a little Italy. In pointing out these
things the speakers at the Mackay meeting
were on firm ground, and would doubtless
have the support of a majority of the pro-
ducers; but when certain enthusiasts en-
deavored to make political capital and elec-
tioneering propaganda out of this very deli-
cate international' question by declaring that
the only way to check the influx was to
change the Federal Government at the next
elections, they were about as convincing as
Mr. Theodore when he announced that the
only party capable of stamping out the Bed
menace was the Labor party. The Italian
question has been facing Queensland for a
long time, and the State Labor Government
has remained entirely apathetic, though the
control of the Queensland portion of the
Federal immigration scheme is in the hands
of the State Parliament; wherefore the offer
of a Federal Labor Government as a panacea
looks like a poor joke.

repertoire of “wage-slavery,” “Labor’s
fetters,” “class-consciousness,” "bloated capi-
talists,” etc., but I also sigh, and wonder
why it is that we have no enthusiasm like
his on our side. It may be that my little
counter-jumping friend’s enthusiasm is in-
spired by a lively sense of favors to come if
his party succeeds. On the other hand, 1
once heard a Nationalist make a remark
that set me on the track of Fuller’s failure.
He said: “Why should I continue voting for
the Nationalists? They do nothing for us
when we put them in, whereas when the
Labor crowd get in they grab everything in
sight for their supporters.” He was a cocky
farmer, and of course took a sordid view of
politics; but, like hundreds of other country
electors, he recognised that “spoils for the
victors” is most of the game as it is played
now. Those who vote Labor, including
Government servants, are stirred to enthusi-
astic efforts by the hope of getting more
money for less work, and. incidentally, their
opponents’ jobs. The Nationalists offer their
supporters merely the negative pleasure of
preventing the other crowd from getting on
the Ministerial pay-roll. They receive nothing
themselves for helping the old diehards to
regain power, and only in a small measure
do they prevent the Labor party from getting
what they want. If the Labor party gets
in its slogan is, “Give ’em Hell!” The
Nationalists are more generous, and say:
“We’ll give these people the reforms they
want; but in our own way.” Before the
last election the Nats, were so very generous
that they granted special leave to enable
public servants to stump their electorates as
Labor candidates, abusing the Government
that paid their salaries. One can’t imagine
a private, employer allowing an employee
leave-of-absence to seek a job with a busi-
ness rival with the understanding that his
old job was waiting for him if he failed.
But the Fuller party always put on six-
ounce gloves against the bare knuckles of
the Labs., and, barring Bavin and a
few others, none of them can put up
a scrap that is likely to arouse the
enthusiasm of the electors. They owed
the support they got, not to any of their own
virtues as legislators, but to the fact that
we in the country feared the Socialists more
than we despised the Nationalists. It has
been said that the Progressives in the Goul-
burn electorate gave victory to Lang by
refusing to continue their preferences to
the Nationalists. Wrong! What turned a
sure victory into defeat in that electorate
was the asinine act of the Protestant De-
fence League in publishing full-page attacks
at the last moment upon a religious that has
more than the average number of adherents
in that electorate. Hundreds of electors
who had nothing in common with Labor
ideals, and had no intention of voting Labor,
showed their resentment by turning down the
Nat. and Prog, candidates. Moreover, the
sole candidate the Protestant Defence League
advised electors to vote for was, naturally,
the weakest man who applied for the job.

Lord Apsley, who wandered this *wa.v for
the Imperial Press Conference, made a fairly
wide inspection of Tropical Australia, and
found it wholly and entirely good. He did
600 or 700 miles of the western part of the
Territory, by rail, car and horse, and then
crossed Westralia per motor to the coast,
and flew to Perth. He describes the land he
saw as rich, well watered, well mineralised,
capable of supporting a large population, so
healthy that men are still young at 70. and
a region which has “no hardships and no
terrors.” Also he added that it wanted
nothing save means of communication, and
(in effect) that Darwin hasn’t a dog’s hope
“till the railway goes through.” Every-
body who knows anything knows that; but
unluckily the average politician can’t see
the use of building railways to bring popu-
lation unless the population (and conse-
quently the voting power) is there already.
Apsley’s young enthusiasm (he is only 30
and gained the D.S.O. at 23) is that of a
man who hasn’t yet been corrupted by the
vote hunt, though he has twice success-
fully pursued the shy elector at Southampton.
"S.H.D.”: One of the latest dodges to get
over the Customs barriers is to obtain prices
for an article that can be manufactured
locally as well as imported. The wily im-
porter places orders for a large proportion
of the total quantity to be imported, and
approaches the Customs with a request for
remission of duty on the condition that he
will order the remainder from the local manu-
facturer if the remission is granted. In a
recent case 190 articles were required, cost-
ing with duty £25 each, or £4750 in all. It
was finally arranged that 160 should be im-
ported at £2O each, and 30 made locally at
£37 each —total, £437o—the lot being de-
livered into the warehouse at £3BO less than
if duty had been paid on all. The revenue and
the local manufacturer, both lost on the deal.
If the Customs really want to get the best-
results out of these remissions they grant,
they shduld arrange that the total disburse-
ment becomes equal to the amount that would
be paid if duty were charged on the full con-
signment. In the case mentioned this condi-
tion would have been fulfilled if 134 had been
imported at £2O and 56 had been made
locally at £37, a total disbursement of £4752,
which is near enough to the previous total
of £4705.

“Lister” : One of the bright spots of medical
research relates to the treatment of asthma,
which, while not as fatal as cancer or tuber-
culosis, is about as unpleasant a malady as
a man could wish for his worst enemy. Since
1910 there has been a sequence of discover-
ies, as a result of which a large proportion of
sufferers can be cured. Asthma and hay
fever are brothers ; one complaint affects the
lungs and the other the nose. Investigation
showed that asthmatic people were sensitive
to different substances on inhaling (in some
cases swallowing) which a typical attack
was produced. Amongst the causes were pol-
lens, hairs from dogs and cats, and foods
such as eggs and potatoes. (Incidentally,
modern research is demonstratng the folly
of forcing children to eat food which they say
they don't like.) It was then found that by
preparing an extract of these substances, a
skin test could be taken and the particular
substance to, which the patient was sensitive
determined. From this it was only a step
to preparing quantitative extracts by gradu-
ated dose* of which the patient could be
desensitised and thus rendered immune. About

found to be sensitive; in about 85 per cent,
of these a cure has been effected. In the
development of this treatment a large amount
of the good work has been done in Australia.

“Nell Gray” : I travelled 12,000 miles on
one of the Bay liners —the Hobson’s Bay—•
and fared quite differently from Francis
Jackson (B. l/10/’25). I came from Lon-
don as an assisted immigrant, and, instead
of finding the stewards dirty and otherwise
objectionable, declare that those on our ship
set an example to the passengers. Further,
they treated us migrants, who were unable to
tip them, with the utmost consideration.
Nor can I credit the statement “that to be
five minutes late at table was an offence which
will most likely bring abuse upon vour head
of an offensive and vulgar kind.” On our
trip I never once saw a sign of such conduct.
Francis Jackson declares that the food
was badly cooked. This is quite contrary to
what is usually said by Bay passengers, and
we certainly found no cause for complaint on
this score. There was the strictest super-
vision with regard to all table utensils, and
the highest standard of cleanliness was
maintained aboard the vessel.

“Hambone”: It’s a wonder that the wool-
growers and their legislative friends don’t
have a smack at circumventing the wool-
buyers’ ring. Seven or eight buyers at
the Australian sales have an understanding
not to cut throats when a particular lot is
put up that some of them desire. One of
them bids and buys, and the lot is divided by
those of the ring wanting it. In a recent
case one firm of buyers was prepared to go
18Id. per lb. for a lot of 17 bales. By con-
nivance, the lot was purchased at 14d. The
grower thus received at least £5O less
than he should have got, and the season’s
losses to the growers must run into thousands
of pounds. Incidentally, the splitting-up of
lots means endless toil to the wool-buyers’
clerks in making out the necessary mani-
fests, delivery notes, etc. Instead of talk-
ing about stabilisation schemes, the graziers
might save themselves a tidy yearly sum by
combating the operations of the ring.

One of the matters mentioned by the Prime
Minister in his policy speech was the estab-
lishment of munition works which are to
be factories in peace and capable of being
diverted to munitions production in war, or
when trouble is threatening. So far as the
manufacture of high explosives and similar
material is concerned, there is only one kind
of factory which can be used for the purpose
at a moment’s notice—works engaged nor-
mally in the manufacture of chemicals and
dye-stuffs. Australia already possesses the
nucleus of an industry of this sort, but the
crippling handicaps imposed by the lack of
adequate tariff protection make it extremely
unlikely that it will ever struggle past the
point at which it now is. Considering the
huge quantities of dyes and chemicals which
this country imports, largely from America,
where Protection has been the means of creat-
ing an enormous production of such things,
there is every likelihood that adequate tariff
protection would bring into existence a
similar industry here. The example of the
United States is interesting and instructive.
Before it put a high duty on imported dye-
stuffs, it manufactured less than 20,0001 b.
of dyes annually. In 1918, a little more than
a year after the high tariff came in', the
country produced 357,662,2511 b. of inter-
mediate coal-tar dyes and 76,802,9591 b. of
the finished article; while in 1923, the latest
year for which figures are available, the
total quantity of the locally-manufactured
finished products was 122.950.1711 b.. valued
at more than £4,000,000. There is not much
doubt that the same thing could be done here
on a smaller scale were the Commonwealth
Parliament to erect a barricade against the
floods of imported stuff which enter the
country. Thereupon, apart from the value of
such an industry, Australia would possess
all the munition factories she would be likely
f o need to supply her armies in the field.
"Moreton’ : Dr. Abrams and his magic box
are getting a great deal of publicity in
Queensland. Premier Gillies, mistaking the
clamor of a clique for the voice of the people,
has promised an official investigation into the
claims made for the cure-all contraption.
Theodore, when Premier, denounced the
business as “mere charlatanry”; but the
amiable Gillies is more accommodating: he
is prepared to investigate anything provided
he is left in office. The pressure was applied
by the Labor organ, the Daily Standard.
which has been barracking for Abrams for
years past—a member of the Standard
staff arranged for the visit of the Abrams
lecturer, Marky. Brisbane has two well-
known Abrams practitioners, both foreigners
—a Pole and a Swede: neither is registered
by the Medical Board, which is a great
grievance with the Abramites. The success
of the publicity in favor of the “treatment”
campaign has encouraged a swarm of quacks
to rush in with demands for investigation
and official recognition; a lady who cures
sore legs is said to have made a particularly
favorable impression on Ministers.

A Royal Commission which has been inquir-
ing for two years into the affairs of the
Victorian ports other than Melbourne has
presented its first progress report. One of
its recommendations is that the system of
control by a local harbor-board should be
adopted everywhere, except in Portland. An-
other is that outward wharfage rates should
be charged at all ports, as in other States.
It is rather extraordinary that this latter
system has not been introduced before. At
Geelong there is very little inward traffic,
and the local Harbor Trust has to seek
revenue for the upkeep of the port and the
dredging of the channels by running a farm.
The Railway Department is trounced for
the ancient swindle of differential rates largely
in the interests of Melbourne. The rail charge
on produce from Nestle’s milk-factory near
Warrnambool to Port Fairy, a distance of
19 miles, is ss. sd. a ton ; the rate to Warr-
nambool pier, miles, is ss. 7d. From Pom-
borneit to Melbourne, 114 miles, the rate per
ton is 275. lid.; to Warrnambool, 52 miles,
it was 265. 9d. a ton, but a recent threat of
motor competition induced the Railway Com-
missioners to reduce this to 17s. 3d. Mel-
bourne, Geelong and Portland are bracketed
as first-class ports; Portland the investiga-
tors describe as “the only port to the west-
ward of Port Phillip Bay capable of dealing
with oversea trade.” Portland is a fine
natural port, with facilities quite adequate
for the shifting of the whole of the wheat
harvest of the Wimmera and the frozen-
meat production of Coleraine and the rest
of the Western District. It has ample depth
of water in safe anchorage for the largest
vessels trading in these waters. Neverthe-
less a mint of money has been sunk in
the neighboring sand-clioked port of Warr-
nambool in the effort to make it what it
can never be.

“L'Fou”: “Macquarie Street’s” article on
the maintenance and management of
hospitals (E. 17/9/’25) somehow takes
me back a few summers. I see a
Riveriua township drowsing in the after-
noon sunshine. Up the dusty main street
comes a buggy swaying in from a selection
10—or was it 20?—miles out in the heat-
haze. A frightened 12-year-old girl is flog-
ging the tired horse to a gallop to reach Mrs.
Brown's place—Mrs. Brown took in
maternity cases. There is a woman at the
bottom of the buggy. But it was hours too
late. Perhaps it was days too late. I can still
hear Mrs. Brown saying she “couldn’t have
done anything; things had gone too far.”
And next morning a motherless 12-year-old
set out to spend her girlhood tending the
rest of the family. Perhaps happenings like
this were in Andrew Fisher’s mind when
he framed the Baby Bonus legislation. But
what can a bush mother do with £5 ? She
can’t buy accommodation in a first-class
maternity hospital and pre-maternity
clinic with it. It won’t pay private
fees. It might pay travelling expenses
to some centre. But most country public hos-
pitals (in Vic., anyhow) work under a rule
which expressly debars “lunatics, infectious-
disease cases and women for confinement”
from being admitted. I’m not casting any
reflections on the Mrs. Browns. They have
done good work in their time. But this is
an age of co-ordination. Individual effort
can’t manage complicated tasks. Think of
the chaos if, instead of our admirable State-
school system, we instituted an educational
bonus of, say. £2O a year to the parents of
children of school age, and left them to find
teachers as best they could. Universal free
maternity aid, which would not be availed of
by all, would better serve those in need than
the bonus can ever do.

POLITICAL
POINTS
It has been allowed to leak out that the
British Government is quite willing that,
in Australia as in Canada, the State Lieu-
tenant-Governors shall be local citizens
appointed by „the Governor-General, but at
that point concession stops. So that ends
Johanson’B chance of being made an excel-
lency. At last advices Canada lias among
its nine State Governors one knight, one
colonel and seven who are simply his Honor
Mr. Smith. Thev are mostly native-born,
they are reasonably cheap, and they are con-
tinuous, there being no awkward gaps and
stopgaps between the departure of the Karl
of Steak and the belated arrival of his suc-
cessor, Viscount Chop. Australia might do
worse than concentrate on the Canadian
plan.
It is expected that Britain will shortly
remove the embargo on Dominion loans, and
a row of mendicants is already gathering round
the early door. N. S. Wales wants "a
minimum of £5,000,000” and won’t mind
if it’s more. Westralia is after £2,500,000, or
about £6 per inhabitant. S.A. seeks
£1,500,000 and Tasmania £600,000. Other
breathless applicants are expected hourly.
Then the Commonwealth lias a £34,000,000
borrowing arrangement with Britain for
“migration” purposes, concerning which the
Prime Minister stated at Dandenong: —
Once the terms are appreciated by the Governments
and people of the States he believed that schemes
would be submitted to fully absorb the £34,000,000.
It would then be possible to make a further agree-
ment on terms as good, if not better, to an un-
limited amount.
How much some of the States will owe when
they get to the end of that razzle is almost
past conjecture.
The Queensland Ministry is the last word
in feebleness. The position the other day
was that there was a hold-up of deep-sea
British ships. Not only were vessels loaded
with Australian meat not allowed to sail,
but by order of unauthorised and largely im-
ported persons, the supply of coal for the
refrigerators was intercepted, so that the
cargoes of meat might go bad, to the great
loss of the Australian owners. What effect
mountains of decayed meat here would have
on wages in England the low-browed parties
who run the business don’t explain, but at
last advices the Railway Department was
obeying the orders of the foreign insurrec-
tion about not delivering the coal, and the
Government was floating with the stream.
Opposition-leader Charlton seemed to be
standing on his head through most of his
policy speech, but his most beautifully cap-
sized effort was in the matter of foreign
policy;—
Mr. Bruce has strongly urged that Australia should
have a voice in foreign affairs, which, if granted,
woyld mean that Australia would be committed to
any oversea war which Britain may decide upon or
be a party to. Ever since we have had constitutional
government we have been free to decide whether we
will participate in any oversea war, and it depends
entirely on the merits of the case whether Australia
should become involved.
The Charlton idea is that if Australia has
a right to be consulted about a war, so that
its counsel may, by some unbelievable luck,
avert the war, therefore Australia will be
in that war up to the neck, whereas, if it
had no right of protest against going in,
it wouldn’t be in. Of course, Australia is
“involved” in the Empire’s wars in every case
—the Empire’s enemies see to that. But why
should it crave to play the part of the dumb
driven cow, and be involved without saying
anything?
Queensland is due to pass the hundred-
million State debt mark this year, as its lia-
bilities were £97,000,000 last June. Then it
will be one of three century-makers. The
others are Victoria, which began to owe a
hundred millions in 1922, and N.S.W., which
attained to two hundred millions of embar-
rassments in 1923, and is making giant
strides towards three hundred millions.
This is the situation in a nutshell. At the
instigation mainly of a few foreigners vast
quantities of Australian produce are unsold,
unsaleable and in many cases going bad.
This is to continue till certain employers in
Britain grant better wages to a number of
seamen here, many of whom are said to be
non-unionists or members of a sort of black-
leg union of recent origin. Two State Gov-
ernments have more or less actively taKen
sides with the hold-up. To the most active
of the pro-strike Premiers the Prime
ter, in his policy-speech, promised £450,000,
as one year’s instalment of a proposed annual
grant, and to the less militant of the pair
lie has promised a bonus on the output of
his cotton industry. It seems to pay best to
be a bad citizen when the Bruce Government
is the paymaster.
Now that Sir Matthew Nathan has gone
Queensland will be without a Governor for
a long time. The Government will not make
any move to have a successor appointed until
the British Government has said what it is
going to do about the recommendation in
favor of local men as State Governors. If
the recommendation is turned down, the
Labor party will go to the country with “No
more imported Governors!” as its battle-
cry. If the reply is favorable, the Govern-
ment will almost certainly wait until the
elections are over before making an appoint-
ment. Another appointment like that of
Brennan would settle Labor’s chances _of
success. With Theodore out of the running
THE GREASY PIG.
“The Allan-Peacock Government in Victoria is suffering a series of defeats in the House, but so far
is managing to hang on to office.”
Gillies is favorite for the cocked-hat job. He
is not comfortable as Premier; the McCor-
mack section is too strong.
Subservience to the Composite Cabinet is
not the besetting weakness of Vic. Assembly.
Last month a motion for the adjournment
of the House was carried against the Govern-
ment. Last week it was given three or four
hard knocks in the debate on the Forestry
Bill; in one case, after a brisk struggle be-
tween a Cocky and a Laborite to get in first
with an amendment, the Government was
licked by 33 votes to 20. Then Treasurer
Peacock, as tactfully as he could do it,
superseded Mackrell. who was in charge of
the bill. Flushed with victory, Laborite
Frost, tried to consolidate his gains, but Pea-
cock was too many for him. So the bill was
side-tracked for the night, and it will remain
on the siding unless a compromise is arranged
in the lobbies.
In the matter of W. A. Gibbs’s candida-
ture for the Senate, N.SAV. Premier Laug
did the decent thing. Reminded of his pledge
to the State Parliament that under no cir-
cumstances would the nominee Senator con-
test his seat at the general election, Lang
wrote to the A.L.P. executive urging that
Gibbs’s nomination should be withdrawn,
and withdrawn it was. The Ma State Pre-
mier’s declaration that the I.W.W. was “99
per cent, criminal” may now be recalled.
Donald Grant, who was one of the I.W.W.
leaders, is now’ No. 2 on the N.S.W. Labor
ticket for the Senate, and the public would
like to have Lang’s assurance that Grant is
the one-per-center. It would make everybody
feel happier, so to speak.
The annual excursion of the Fleet to Mel-
bourne, which Admiral Addison allowed to
lapse, has been re-instituted by his successor.
Commodore Wardle. In 1922 a Melbourne
paper published a photograph of the Fleet
arriving in Port Phillip with the sole com-
ment. “Up the straight for the Melbourne
Cup.” Addison swore he’d never take the
Fleet to Melbourne at Cup-time again, and
he never did. Wardle looks at it another
way. As about 30 per cent, of the R.A.N.
is recruited from Victoria, it is only a fair
thing that these men should have a week-end
or two in their native, State. The N.S.W.
contingent spends upwards of six months
each year in Sydney and gets frequent week-
ends off, beside night leave every other night;
and a call on Melbourne at Cup-time won't
do recruiting in Victoria any harm. And it
isn’t a wasted period from other points of
view; the Bay is an ideal place for gunnery
and torpedo exercises.
The strike of Vic. railway refreshment-
waitresses owing to the improper use of a
private report by an M.L.A., who was
granted access to the file, gives cause for
anxious thought to every public servant
holding a responsible position. For the pro-
per conduct of public business it is essential
that responsible heads should receive fearless
reports from their subordinates in positions
of trust. What these men want to know is
—What protection have they from the irre-
sponsible member of Parliament out to curry
favor with certain equally irresponsible sec-
tions of the community? This aspect of the
question received very little, if any, consid-
eration from Parliament.
In spite of the official statement made last
March that the cutting-up of Dillalah sta-
tion for closer settlement would not be a
prelude to a general or partial disposal of the
State stations in Queensland, it is now
announced that two more of them, Merluna
and Buckingham Downs, are to be sold.
Dillalah is on the Warrego River, in the
Charleville district, and has an area of 504
square miles. It will be handed over to the
Lands Department at the end of this year,
and will be made available for selection
almost immediately. The out-stations of Cala-
bar, Kenmore and Yena, containing respec-
tively 50,000 acres, 84,000 acres and 25,600
acres of splendid sheep-country, are also to
be sold by tender. This will still leave the
Government with 12 stations on its hands—
a dozen too many, most Queensland tax
payers think.
Of course last week’s remark that “Tom
Givens, President of the Senate, announces
that he will not seek re-election,” referred
only to the presidency. He is a candidate
for the Senate, but will not be a candidate
for the chair.
Australia is still to have the privilege of
paying ex-Lord Mayor Bill Lambert £lOOO
p.a. for helping to make its laws —a few of
them, anyhow. Bill lost the first selection-
ballot for West Sydney, now about the safest
Labor seat in the Commonwealth, but won
the second. The first ballot was upset for
the usual reasons. And, as usual,- the Gov-
ernment takes it for granted that persons
who vote corruptly for one “comrade” against
another at these Labor dogfights are too high-
minded to vote corruptly for Laborites
against Nationalists at general elections The
Federal regulations are such that a blind
man could vote in a dozen subdivisions with
precious little risk.
“Never again,” so the Prime Minister is
credited with stating in liis Daudenong ora-
tion, “must Australia be involved in a war
arising out of foreign policy in which she
had no voice.” Australia has suffered a most
disastrous industrial war which may be the
prelude to insurrection because Walsh here
hates Havelock Wilson at the other side of
the world, and because one set of Britons
wouldn’t give some more Britons another £1
a month. Where was our blessed voice?
Brisbane Trades and Labor Council made
a virtuous gesture in giving the Communist
party notice to quit the room it occupies
at the Trades Hall, but the notice was
hurriedly withdrawn. It is unlikely that
the Communists would have accepted t,
anyhow. The T. and L. Council was annoyed
because the Communists claimed, in the news-
papers, to have a powerful influence in
Council deliberations. Such a claim could
not be allowed to pass (at election-time), so
the eviction was decided upon—and counter-
manded. The affecting incident, will make
no difference in the situation ; the Commu-
nists will continue to sway the big unions,
and whatever the big unions do the T. and
L. Council Avill be compelled to endorse
under pain of being declared “black.”
Some of these Labor unions are consistent,
anyhow. In Melbourne the Builders’
Laborers have held up a hotel job in Itich-
ruond because one of the sub-contractors is
not a member of the bosses’ association; and
either because the boss won’t join, or the
Association won’t have him, neither the
Building Trades Federation nor the Trades
Hall Disputes Committee has been able to
induce the'malcontents to resume work.
Regret that the Empire Press visitors
didn’t get a longer view of one of N.S.W.s
beauty rivers led the S. M. Herald to pro-
duce a leader about “The Noble Clarence.
It made no mention of the fact that the
Clarence might be made usable by big ship-
ping, tliat it would be one of the natural
outlets for the tableland if the railway were
allowed to come through from Inverell, and
that Grafton is a centre of the promising
New State movement. But the picturesque
old city was congratulated on its progress
(Grafton and Grafton South had in-
habitants at last census, having lost 46 in
10 years), something was said about the
advantage of having railway connection with
Sydney and of the Nymboida electricity
scheme, and there was a weep because im-
ported motor-cars weren’t cheaper so that
the sparse population could scuttle around
more.
Victoria and South Aus. lately resur-
rected the old controversy about which of
them gave to the world the secret ballot in
politics. The S.A. Governor’s Speech men-
tioned it in November, 1855, and G. S. King-
ston (father of Charles) formally moved for
it later in the month. It became law about
May, 1856. Meanwhile William Nicholson
moved for it in Vic. Parliament a week
before Christmas, and carried it against the
Haines Governmenit, which resigned, but
came back with an open mind, and rushed
the ballot through in March, six weeks be-
fore the slower-going S.A. politicians finalised
their work. The subsequent improvement is
clearly Adelaide’s. All the early ballots in-
volved crossing out the names of candidates
not wanted. It was Boothby (S.A.) who
introduced in 1858 the cross-in-the-square
idea, which was soon copied in Melbourne
and eventually elsewhere.
Queensland Labor Government’s hospital-
tax bears heavily on the farmers. It is
levied on the unimproved value of the land,
and it works out that Bundaberg, for in-
stance, with a population of . 12,000, con
tributes less than the adjoining shire of Goo
bur rum, population 2000. Cane-cutters earn-
ing £8 or £lO a week contribute nothing
under this tax to the upkeep of an institu-
tion of which they make considerable use,
and one public official with £l5 a week pays
nothing either. But the cocky, though his
chance of an income may have been destroyed
by a strike which broke down his transport
—there is no escape for him!

The gentle Communist arose
With eager zeal to play his part;
The world was full of dreadful foes
To all he treasured in his heart.
If only all these men would strike
And keep on striking every day,
Each idle toiler would be like
Himself and earn an equal pay.
With perfect vision he could see
Where all the ills of earth must lurk;
Equality could never be
As long as people did their work.
This system must be all destroyed
And into wreck and ruin hurled.

There are thus liquids and semi-liquids total-
ling £808,677 against liabilities of £200,596,
including £81,753 on mortgage. The Board
got in a little more money during the year,
and a good deal more will be required to
finance building; exactly lmw it is to be done
the directors have not disclosed. (There are
£135,696 of 74 per cents, unissued; also
£lOO,OOO worth of unspecified reserved
shares.) Capital moved up by £5471 in the
past 12 months and an additional £22,421
came in 011 mortgage. On the other side
£18,906 was added to freehold and leasehold;
stock was £44,912 lighter—-a substantial
drop due in part to heavy purchases before
the close of the 1924 accounts —and cash,
investments, etc., moved up £52,997. Share-
holders are comfortably situated, and the
pref. position is a strong one. At July 31
there were net assets of £1,024.230 and the
pref. capital totalled £264,304, leaving a
satisfactory margin for the 500,000 £1 ordi-
naries, and there is no will-o’-the-wisp in the
accounts. The scrip has a good market;
ords. were recently quoted buyers, 285.;
sellers, 295.; and 19s. 6d. was asked for the
6 p.c. Ist prefs. (£150,000) and 21s. for the

At June 30, 1921, the co. owed its bankers
£274,211 ; at latest balance the amount was
£205,106 less, and the reduction had been
effected mainly by working stock down from
almost half a million to £172,533. Such
improvement since the crash in rubber ami
cotton in 1921 is a promising sign apart
altogether from other favorable factors. It
might almost be said that the co. has floated
back to prosperity on balloon tyres, which
last year accounted for 25 p.c. of total fac-
tory output. Additional plant was installed
to enable production to be increased by be-
tween 1000 and 1500 tyres per week. Mean-
time side-lines have been assiduously de-
veloped : thus for the first time in the his-
tory of Australian tennis a local ball (Bar-
net Glass) is to be used in the coming.
inter-State and Victorian championships.
And the markets have helped. The Stevenson
scheme for the restriction of the rubber crop
did not allow for the rapid growth of world
demand, with the result that the recent
expansion—mostly due to “balloons” —caught
the world's manufacturers unaware. Bar-
net Glass, however, had bought well, not
only for the past and current year, but for
portion of next, and the result lias been
profit to shareholders and benefit to Austra-
lian users.
During the year prefs., which had been going
short since 1921, were given 15 p.c., and the
directors hope to at least reduce the out-
standing amount (11 p.c. = £21,788) during
the current term. With a spring in gross
profits. last year from £139,843 to
£201,330 —and the first two months of
the current term showed the largest
turnover and the best net profits in
the history of the co. —that should pre-
sent no difficulties. Assuming that the co.
escapes the pitfalls of the erratic rubber
market, it should not be long either before
ordinaries once more get a return. Chairman
W. A. Watt told the annual meeting that
a reorganisation had made the Swanston-
street property unnecessary, and it had been
sold for £48,000 as against its book value
of £28,595. It was not a cash sale, but
the profit was to be earmarked “as the
nucleus of a reserve to be used to re-instate
ordinary capital to the old face value.” The
experience of Barnet Glass is a lesson to
other cos. which are over-eager in lifting
the div. rate and cannot see a few thousands
accumulated in reserves without itching to
make a bonus issue. Although it was the
collapse of rubber which plunged the co.
into its difficulties, it was the undue haste
in capitalisation which made adjustment
impossible except by writing down capital.
However, the tide has turned, as this com-
parison shows: —

The building-up process can be resumed as

gible assets equal to 41s. for each pref.

Chairman Reginald Black told shareholders
that reserves are to receive more attention,
and he warned them against being hungry
for gift distributions. The Board holds that
as trust funds increase the reserve fund
should be augmented because the risks of
the business are very real, very numerous
and ever present. But there is this silver
lining to the cloud which the directors paint:
The Board has decided to increase paid-up capital
from time to time, as the fact that we have sound
investments, such as Government stock and mortgages,
to offer as security must be stronger evidence of
our stability than would be the case should most
of that security consist of unpaid capital. It will,
therefore, be the policy of the Board as the business
increases to call up additional capital at appropriate
times.
And as the subscribed capital is £1,000,000
and the called capital only £150,000, there
is plenty of scope; and, even if 12| p.c. on
more bonus capital isn’t to bo thought of for
a while, there is, a lot of comfort in the pros-
pect of getting 124 p.c. on some capital pro-
vided in cash. Really the directors never
have been lavish with bonuses : the co. was
•12 years old before the first gift issue was
made, and in all only £35,000 has been
transferred from reserves. Of the latest capi-
talisation £2500 comes from investments
fluctuation account. It represents provision
made in 1021 when some of the Government
stocks held hv the co. were quoted at a
substantial discount, and no longer consid-
ered necessary.
The trustee co. is an increasingly popular
institution, and Australia’s greatest con-
tinues to move forward. The very rapid
increase of trusts in hand has been partly
caused by the rise in values; on the other
hand the increasingly heavy death duties
have impelled more and more people to make
gifts during their lifetime. These figures
show how the co.'s operations have worked
out

Although the business is profitable, the
valuable service is rendered at a moderate
charge. This column can’t say exactly what
the average coist is, because the income from
all sources is heaped together; but assuming
a (j p.c. return from investments the aver-
age cost seeme to be from 6s. to 6s. 6d. p.c.
p.a. of the value of the estate; and in
many cases it is well under that figure.
Trustees cos! have not yet arrived at the
stage where they guarantee the principal and
interest, although that is done (with cer-
tain strict limitations in regard to invest-
ments; of course) by the Public Trustee in
Maoriland. But they do guarantee that
there will be no defalcations and that the
testator’s instructions will be carried out
to the letter, and the Perpetual puts up
£327,512 in paid capital and reserves and
£830,000 in uncalled capital as a guarantee.
Its funds include gilt-edged stock and de-
posits £100,929, loans on mortgage and
other investments £117,373, and pre-
mises and equipment £115,000. It charges
one commission on the capital value
and annual commission on the income,
and follows the usual practice of re-
serving portion of the corpus commission,
taking credit for it as the estate is wound
up. Last year the disclosed net profit was
£4055 less than the figure in the introduc-
tory table. That amount represented the
corpus commission on new business added
to the reserve during the year over and above
the amount extracted. The account is
treated as a true reserve in the table, the
total reserves at June 30 consisting of
general reserve, £100,000; commission re-
serve. £64,622; investment fluctuation,
£2500: p. and I. balance, £10,390. The
amount shown as written off represents
additions of £lOOO to officers’ fidelity insur-
ance fund and £l5OO to officers’ provident
fund. In addition the latter benefited , by
£lOO4 charged against revenue.

On . the figures published by the holding co.
things didn’t look comfortable. Year after
year the reserves had been bitten into to
pay the 8 p.c. div.; and though last year
things improved revenue still only just met
the distribution. The accounts of the sub-
sidiary, however, show that last year £2714
was put by, after £6103 had been written
off against depreciation; further, there are
accumulated reserves of just over £lO,OOO
plus £5164 in insurance and contingency
funds. Thus, as there are no assets of
the sort that you can only sec with the eye
of faith, the position is a good deal better
than one would judge by the table printed
above. Presumably there are reasons: but
on the face of things it seems rather absurd
to maintain the two cos., seeing that the
assets of the holding co. consist wholly of
shares in the other co.
The last balance-sheet published by the
proprietary co. was in 1919, when paid capi-
tal was £121.500. Profits for that year were
£14,854 and the div. rate 8 p.c. Changes
since then are shown in this comparison:—-

Stocks . . . . 79,572 72.631 83,184
Conditions in this trade last year were
“unprecedently slack and depressed,” and
1924 was almost as bad. Marshall’s Pty.
really did very well to show the profits it
did, especially as a certain amount of capi-
tal was unproductive during the two terms
while the factory was being modernised. It
is now claimed to be the largest and best-
equipped in the Southern Hemisphere. No-
thing is said as to the trend of expenses, and
as a p. and 1. account of the proprietary
was published only for 1925 is
impossible. Mention has already been made
of the £6103 written off as depreciation on
plant, etc., although the co.’s early practice,
at any rate, was to charge repairs and re-
newals against revenue, and it may be the
practice still. Goodwill, £5OOO in 1919, lias
been wiped out. Freeholds on June oO
carried a mortgage of £16,000. W ith the
new plant completed the subsidiary should
do better. If it doesn’t there will be little
left to come and go on after the 8 p.c. has
been paid on the increased capital (£170,(32
up £lO,OOO on the 1924 figures).

According to chairman Kelso King, the
chief cause operating to reduce profits last
year was the “serious opposition” from
Cockatoo (Federal) and Walsh Island
(State) dockyards. And, as if that was not
trouble enough, the co. was given a bad
scare by the declared intention of the late
N.S.W. Government to build a floating dock
at Newcastle under a subsidy from the Federal
Government. The directors have put before
the Lang Government a statement which it
“trusts will influence it to abandon the
undertaking.” But whatever the. decision
regarding this project, there seems little like-
lihood of either Cockatoo or Walsh Island
being closed down, and Mort’s Dock will
have to resign itself to competition from
those sources. And it is competition which
has this advantage in fixing prices—it doesn’t
have to allow for rates and taxes. Realising
what it is up against, the co. has exerted
itself to maintain its plant at a high state
of efficiency; and with that in view the
business of Chapman and Co., Ltd., of Bal-
main, was bought last year. All this lias re-
sulted in a big rise in the chief asset. Here
is the balance-sheet position over the past
three years:—-

Book debts and work in
progress, etc.. . .. 157,339 160,104 77,663
The net movement last year was slight,
although there was a heavy increase in the
chief item and a steep drop in sundry debtors
and “uncompleted work”—the recent ship-
ping strike played its part in reducing the
volume of work on hand.
In August, 1920, there was a revaluation
of assets, and reserves were capitalised, the
two together allowing of an issue of five
bonus shares for eight old ones; and that
makes the 5 p.c. better than it looks. But
there is only a poor chance of any early
substantial improvement.

was switched on. Promoters took £20,000 of

cally the same as that of the City Electric

£24,669 and £l 9.720 in 1924 and 1923 re-
spectively, "Ample provision has been made
for doubtful debts,” the directors say; and
this Column would not start with surprise
if it was told that the depreciation reserve
—£5250 after final allocations—hid some
true profits Inside it. Liabilities on June
30 totalled £18,686, and that is very mod-
erate. But to a very great extent the assets
have to be taken on trust, seeing that ot a
total Of £109,049 no less than £54,40l con-
sists of “branch balances” and £<7,348 of
“mortgages and Investments.’ Uncertainty
as to tile realisable value of these securities
is the Weak point so far as this investment
is eoncetned, Oil paper after the final div.
had been paid there were net tangible assets
equal to £7 11s. Od. for each pref. share, or
235, Gd. for each £ of capital. The co. s
business is well controlled and still expand-
ing, and tile coming year is expected to show
good results,

lil response to many requests from anxious
shareholders, the London-controlled North
White Feather .Co.. (W.A.) has issued a
Statement regarding its Hie mine
Officials are mum, but the local inspector of
mines opines that “very great possibilities
are ahead of the eo. A Bulletin man who
knows the show declares that the inspector
is an Optimist,

. Brown’S , Beward Co., which recently
claimed, to have something good on its Field
Find silo'Wi, has just obtained a fair-sized
ounce crushing. There is a little tonnage, of
similar stuff available above lOOft., bilt
opinions are divided as to whether the shoot
will live down. The market seems to think
it won’t.

E. B. Jensen, the results of whose visits
to the Radio mine (W.A.) have been the
subject of conjecture, reckons that £5OOO will
properly equip the show. Three lodes exist
in a crushed zone of greenstone, and Jensen
decides that the shoots where bisected at
2Soft. are satisfactory. After running his
rule over the three makes of ore in the mine,
he discards the western footwall formation.
The lodes bulge and contract and carry gold
in three runs of quartz, of which the middle
one is tlie richest. A shaft has gone down
oil it, and the advice of Jensen is to open
Up thoroughly at the 280 ft. level. Then it
will be easy to decide whether to put capital
into the Radio or to list it as another blasted
hope.

As Tarcoola (S.A.) is played out Tarcoola
Blocks is prospecting a lease at Ajana, near
Northampton I W.A.). This brings a re-sliuffle
to get In capital. A new co. is to be formed
In 150,000 shares of ss. each, 100,000 of
which are to be at the disposal of Blocks
shareholders. Underwriting has been done,
the consideration being 25,000 shares to be
given the bold blade at 6d. a share upon pay-
ment of sixpence each. Only 20,000 shares
need be applied for to ensure registration,
so that the underwriter has no long road to
tMvel to obtain his reward.

If professional service can pull a show
through the new United Mt. Painter Radium
is equipped for big things. Allen Bowler
and Fred Tricks look after the practical
work, and Drs. Bull and Flecker bring in
science to entice the modest radium elemeut
from its retreat. The co.’s first job was to
get water. Then it tackled 300 tons of re-
jects left at the surface by the war-time
Radium Extraction Co. when it faded from
Mt. Painter for a cooler clime. Hand-pick-
ing gave 30 tons of ore, which assays from
34 p.c. to 6 p.c. oxide of uranium. Another
go at the same dump is expected to bring
concentrates up to 90 tons, which may aver-
age a 5 p.c. grade. If so the talk is of a
value of £23,000 from the grave by
this composite board. Nor is that all the
glad news. Another dump of 80 tons at
No. 8 workings is to be sieved, and a small
lot awaits the enterprising staff at No. 7
open cut. With, a possible £23,000 at the
surface there was every inducement to look
for more in the old workings. If chairman
W. Roberts isn’t drawing the long-bow,
mining already done shows good results.
Thus at No. 6 workings areas rich as 20 p.c. in
uranium oxide exist in a small portion of a lode
2|ft. wide, and the rich shoot has been traced
down to 100 ft. To-day the estimate of ore
at No. 6 is 1000 tons of 2 p.c. uranium oxide.
That is modestly stated to carry £lOO,OOO of
associated radium! Then at No. 7 workings
is a seam of ore which carries gummite.
How that will pan out in the market the
office computer docs not record. At No. 8
there "are indications of an immense tonnage
of ore.” What are to be its uranium-radium
contents will probably be revealed next year.
As a side-line a patch of niobium is being
wafted to Frankfort for treatment. Thus
the co. stands until 20 tons of the uranium-
oxide product goes to Dry Creek for treat-
ment. A good report thence, and to Mt.
Painter will go a dry-concentrating plant
which Roberts avows lias been tested and
brought to the successful stage.

Timor Petroleum Co., of Melbourne, an
amalgamation of Timor Petroleum Holdings,
a Sydney syndicate, and Timor Oil Limited,
a Sydney company, has just received news
from H. B. Manderson, via Darwin, that
he will land 20 tons of crude oil from Timor
in M°fi ) ourne about the end of October. The
oil has been bailed from 25 potholes from
10 to 12 feet deep. It occurs not as a
seepage, but as a saturation near the sur-
face; every shallow hole fills up with
crude oil, which is then emptied with
kerosene-tins. Natural gas. occurs all over
the area now being prospected, so there
can. be no doubt that petroleum exists in
the vicinity. Drilling with a standard rig
and casing must be the next step, and Dr.
A. Wade, late Commonwealth geologist,
thinks oil will be struck as a gusher at
1000 feet. The co. has secured over 5000
acres from the Portuguese authorities, and
Dr. Wade, it is understood, will go to
Lisbon to secure more concessions. Timor
is equi-distant from Darwin and Singapore,
being about 350 miles north-west of Darwin.
The capital of the co. is £200,000 in £1
Shares,

Henry Jones, late manager of the Golden
Lily. Aberfcldy (Vic.), isn’t such a sick
man as to lose interest in the show. So an
over-sold market curled up when he reported
that the claim has a great future. The
south level has been on the run of stone
for 386 ft. and the north level is out 140 ft. A
rise from No. 2 tunnel is on the way, and
there will be 350 ft. of backs on a reef that
ranges from ltt. to 6ft. in width. As a
side-line the co. lias the eastern reef to de-
velop. Jones says it should be reached in
another 50ft., and as a lot of stone came for
this lode near the surface his opinion is that
it can be relied on to top off the middle-reef
stone very nicely. If that is so the bears
will be still further disturbed.
After having been the main prop of Ben-
digo Amalgamated, Carlisle has gone
on supplying stone for the present co.
from the spurry zone below 1140 ft.
Although it is still about payable, search
for better-grade spurs is in hand. Old-timers
recall that the rule on the field is to
find good stone on the line of faulting on
the lower reaches of the east backs of pro-
ductive reefs. So the order has gone round
to test levels above 1140 ft. The drill when
set to work at 741 ft. cut stone, and so the
east crosscut there will be run. out to sec
what the spurs are like. Similar work is
to be done at 450 ft. All Bendigo is watching
this gamble. If pay stpff is exposed a new
field of prospecting is ahead which may again
make Pall Mall a busy resort.

Mount Bischoff Co. (Tas.) has secured
an option over all the adjoining leases held
by Smith Bros. Lindesay Clark, of Briseis,
and J. 11. Levings, manager of Bischoff, will
test the area. A drill is being secured tor
the purpose of further testing parts of
the old Bischoff.

A circular issued by Mt. Morgan con-
tains information about the lately proposed
change in mining and treatment methods: —
Present methods of mining would be discarded in
favor of the open-cut system, the ore being, extracted
bv steam or electric shovels, then concentrated,
followed by roasting the concentrates, the calcines
smelted in reverberatory furnaces and the matte blown
to blister copper in a new converter plant. An
important feature of the scheme is that the ore
amenable to treatment would be increased from
2,700,000 tons to 8,000,000 tons, and extraction
would be at the rate of 800,000 tons per annum. The
preliminary data collected by Mr. Horsburgh indi-
cate that a capital expenditure of over £1,000,000
would be required, and the scheme is based on the
amortisation of the capital involved and a reasonable
return to shareholders when full production is
attained.
Subsequent industrial war, the fire and the
flood to overcome the fire have reduced the
position, in the opinion of Chairman Niall,
to this:—
It is necessary to emphasise that irreparable damage
may have been caused to the mine by the fire and
the subsequent flooding. Not until the Are is ex-
tinguished will it be possible to ascertain the extent
of the damage and to decide whether the expenditure
involved in the thorough investigation of Mr. Hors-
burgh’s proposals would be justified. Should the
investigation be proceeded with, shareholders may
rest assured that no scheme will be submitted for
their approval unless your directors feel that it has
every prospect of success. If the proposals are found
impracticable, shareholders will be at once informed,
and the necessary steps taken to suspend all operations
at Mount Morgan. It will remain to be decided
whether the plant and equipment at the mine be
realised and the remaining assets of the company
held as investments, or whether all the assets should
be disposed of and the company Anally liquidated.
Charters Towers (Q.) refuses to throw
in the towel. The latest scheme is to pr05£24,669
pect the Black Jack country five miles*
from old quartzopolis. Clark’s Gold-mining
shareholders are expected to find £3OOO, and
a two-to-one subsidy from the Government,
if the pre-election eye of that benevolent
institution can be caught, is expected to
complete the necessary wad. The same fond
parent is to be asked to find £2OO extra to
secure and shift the necessary machinery to
the Black Jack site. Three reefs at vary-
ing dips are anticipated to join at 020 ft.
Old hands recall that Black Jack once
worked on 3ft. stone averaging 30z., but that
is a way old hands and old reefs have.
“Lead Zinc”: A Mt. Isa Prop, contributor
(B. l/10/’25) estimates a £4-per-ton profit
as available from Ibus ore averaging 5.92 per
cent, lead, 13.9 per cent, zinc and 4oz. silver,
with a gross value of £S 4s. 4d. per ton at
current metal prices, and on the basis of
Broken Hill South Co.’s working cost of
435. lid. per ton. Broken Hill South dur-
ing the year ended June 30 mined and milled
258,255. tons crude ore averaging lead 13.0
•per cent., zinc 10.7 per cent., silver soz.
The gross value of this ore at the metal
prices current for that year was £9 4s. 2d.
per ton. On the Mt. Isa contributor’s
method of appraisal, a working cost of 435.
lid. should result in a profit to Broken Hill
South of something over £5 15s. per ton.
The South Company’s working account shows
that, assuming under-valuation of concen-
trate in course of realisation and in stock
was the same as in the previous year, the
258,255 tons treated yielded a profit of
£475,860, or £1 17s. Id. per ton. Taxation
and other charges reduced this by 22 per
cent. — i.c., to £1 9s. per ton —and debenture
redemption and provisions for new plant
left approximately £1 7s. 6d. per ton as
the profit available for distribution to share-
holders. The marked discrepancy between, say,
£5 15s. and £1 7s. 6d. per ton is due to
metal losses in milling and smelting, cost
of lead smelting and zinc smelting, cost of
transporting and realising metals, interest
charges as well as taxation and other
outgoings already referred to. One thing is
certain. Broken Hill South would, even on
the very good metal prices which ruled last
year, have made a very heavy loss if. instead
of handling an ore running over 13 per cent,
lead, it had to deal with ore of Ibus grade,
viz., about 6 per cent. lead.
* * * *
The new shoot in the Sardine. Kangaroo
Hills (N.Q.). should give the mine a good
run. Payable ore ranging from a few
inches to 3ft. Gin. has been proved over a
length of 95ft. in the No. 3 stope and is
going further at both ends. A winze down
30ft. below No. 3 proves an average of ISin.
of ore, and in No. 4 North for a length of
21ft. the average thickness is no less.
Values touch 20 p.c., but all through it
should pan out between 12 and 15 p.c. con-
centrates, and in the workings above-men-
tioned will average about ISin.
* * * *
Operations on the Chillagoe State Smel-
ters (Q.) for 1924-25 did not come up to
"expectations financially, resulting in a loss
of £29,928. This despite that the lead
market was over £35 for a considerable part
of the year and that it was reported that
a good deal of the ore treated was pur-
chased at prices on a metal basis round about
£3O. For the year 1923-24 the loss, accord-
ing to the Auditor-General, was £56,897.
Latest crushing at Ravenswood (Q.) was
162 tons for lOOSloz. free gold and 53 tons
concentrates of a combined value of £5083.
Now that Mt. Morgan is temporarily out of
the picture, Ravenswood takes pride of place
in the North. But that doesn’t mean much
these days.

Tingha Tin (N.S.W.) got its turnover up
to 12,600yd5. for September, for a recovery
of seven tons oxide. The August yield was
similar, but the co. is still a long way off
the 20,000yds. forecasted for the suction
cutter in its infancy.
The anaemic New White Crystal, Ardle-
than (N.S.W.), excelled itself last week.
Of its 150,000 contribs., 99,500 were offered
at auction for forgetting about calls, and
2500 only were taken —at 3d. The Board
promptly struck a call of Is., so the next
auction should be worth while.
The oil-chasing business so far as Sydney
is concerned is still very sick. The New
Guinea Co. has nothing cheerful to impart,
but Haynes Bros, and Bob Hartwell have
not abandoned hope. Ormildah, Sepik River,
Mandated Territory, has got its 12in. drill
down to 305 ft. “in blue shale with sand-
stone streaks.” Mandated Development Co.
at Matapau has punched No. 2 bore to 661 ft.
“in grey shale.” Melbourne has no luck to
report from Taranaki either. The Tarata
bore is down 3450 ft., of which 3435 ft. has
been cased. The other hole, Moturoa, is
•MlOft., and casing cemented to 2056 ft. The
rig has been repaired while cement hardens.
Other syndicates are nibbling at options
whose only hope is a Taranaki success.
Rawang (F.M.S.) has converted its
Malayan "dollar to sterling, and the register
will contain 240,000 20s. shares instead of
2,000,000 at 2s. 4d. In order ■to make the
change, it was decided to capitalise 57,143
dollars, portion of undivided profits, but
the decimal so obtained remains a rugged
one, each new 20s. share representing 8.57
dollars’ worth of the old scrip. It is no joke
to convert a 2s. 4d. dollar into sterling, or
vice versa. An interim div. of Is. is payable
on the new issue on November 23. This,
will take £12,000.

Kamunting shares had a sharp rise of 75..
(to 00s.) last week on the news that No. 4
dredge is to be scrapped as a suction cutter
and refitted with bucket appliances. In the
annual report to Dec., 1923, it was admitted
that the alteration of No. 4 to a suction
cutter was an experiment. "But,” added
the report, "the geographical conditions rul-
ing on the property indicate that the ground
to be treated is by its nature adapted to this
method.” The onus of proving this, how-
ever, was laid on the contractors by agree-
ment. A year later the report announced
that “No. 4 dredge, converted into a suction
cutter, is now in commission. On Dec. 10
it started its 00-days’ trial run, which, the
conversion contract requires, shall be con-
tinuous and satisfactory.” Since that time
the monthly announcement of yields took no
stock of tlie part being played by No. 4 in
its new shape. Apparently it did not prove
a success, and tin at £270 does not
encourage protracted experiments with
new processes. All the same, the best that
can be said for bucket dredges is that they
are clumsy contraptions scarcely better than
makeshifts.


THEIR IDEA OF DEPORTATION.
“G. H. Mason, of the Sydney City Council’s Electricity Department, ‘an efficient and reliable man,’ after 15 years’ service has been dismissed for refusing to join the
Municipal Employees’ Union (affiliated with the Trades Hall). This involves forfeiture of all rights, including retiring allowance.”
LITTLE AUSTRALIA: “What are they doing that for, Mister?”
THE INSTRUCTOR OF YOUTH: “Oh, him—he had opinions of his own, the blighter!”

“and it's
printed with
WIMBLE'S INKS”
“Percy Piuktape”: A coming Melbourne
breach-of-promise case will apparently be
fought out on the rights of man —and woman.
The young man, who has what most modern
women will regard as prehistoric ideas of
man’s rights, asked his fair to come in to a
meeting by train, and, on her demurring,
made it an order. Defiantly she arrived by
tram, and the young man declared the en-
gagement off on the ground that a young
woman who so flagrantly disobeyed a reason-
able command would never make a dutiful
wife. Attempts have been made to heal the
breach, but the young man is not prepared
to go on with the marriage unless she gives
a legally binding undertaking to be obedient.
So far from agreeing, she has instituted
breach proceedings. If the young man wins,
it will be a greater victory than masculine
supremacy has achieved for years.

“Harold Ilardupp" : A woman in a Mel-
bourne suburb has written to the local coun-
cil asking for a stricter control of the speed
of motor vehicles, including the council's
own juggernauts. She wanted to know
whether she could insure lie)- husband so as
to get something if he was run over. If she
could she didn’t care how fast the vehicles
went; as it was, she was always afraid he
would be brought home an unprofitable
corpse owing to “the old fool’s” habit of
wandering about when drunk. The lady’s
epistle finished with a request that the coun-
cil should not let her lord know she had
written about him. An even weirder letter
was received lately by another council. It
was written by a woman who declared that
the whole municipality was acquainted with
her husband’s drinking habits and would be
thankful if they were remedied. Her sug-
geston was that the municipal dirtcart
might trundle along some night when her
husband* was drunk and incapable and take
possession of him. Her view was that being
dumped into a garbage cart and borne away
to be fired out on the muncipal tip might
shock him into habits of sobriety. The
councillors, however, were dull, unimagina-
tive people who turned down the opportunity
of making a great experiment.
* * * #
“X.N.0.”: A few weeks ago the police-
court surgeons in London put their heads
together and tried to standardise drunken-
ness, i.e., to discover some formula by which
it could be decided whether an individual
was drunk or not, and, if drunk, from what
degree of insobriety he suffered. Once more
a page might be taken out of naval practice.
The responsible authority in the R.N., re-
porting a case of which drunkenness is a
feature, is required to say if the accused
was “drunk” or '‘sober.” No intermediate de-
grees are admitted, and such expressions as
“under the influence” or “bad taken drink”
are absolutely barred at the defaulter’s table.
If the reporting authority has any doubt
about it, the standard by which he is to
judge is wdiether the individual could or
could not do his. ordinary job. If a gunlayer,
could he control and lay his gun accurately
for an hour on end? And so forth. I had
doubts about a Maltese bandsman once at
Gibraltar, and to settle the point sent one of
his compatriots down to get whatever instru-
ment he played. He returned with a trom-
bone. The Maltese w r as drunk all right, but
as the time was 11.30 on a very still night
I wasn’t at all popular for allowing an en-
tirely new rendering of a “Cavalleria Rusti-
cana” selection to disturb the slumbers of
my brother-officers.

“Windsor”: Big though the Vic. Railways
lost-property store is, it is a hard task to
cram into it all the articles found in the
trains or left unclaimed at stations. Among
the rest are a spring-cart, a harvester, a
buggy and a portable engine. This portable
engine, in first-class condition and worth a
good deal, was left unclaimed at a country
station and forwarded to the lost-property
store. After it had lain there a month, the
owner strolled in casually, paid the accumu-
lated charges without demur, spent an ener-
getic Sunday afternoon cleaning and oiling
it for removal, announced his intention of
taking it away the next day and —strolled
off again. He hasn’t been seen or heard of
since, and, eight months having elapsed, the
engine will be sold at the next' auction.

“Sixenate”; Sentimental feelings were
stirted in the Melbourne Divorce Court when
an eight-year-old decree was brought up with
a request that it should be made absolute.
The forgotten document was laid before his
Honor with an intimation that the decree
absolute had not been sought because the
parties had been unable to come to an
agreement upon alimony as directed by
Justice Hodges, who complicated the posi-
tion by dying before a settlement was
No. 2.
He waited.

THE HAT THAT ONCE.
“I say, Dad, you don't want this old hat any
more, do you? May I hare it?"
“My dear child, I can deny you nothing.
But what in”
“Never you mind; just you wait and see!"
reached; but the hint was given that now
the long-sundered parties desired to re-marry,
and they wanted to be quite sure that they
were really divorced before they faced the
altar together again. Justice Weigall cleared
up the situation for them and wished them
joy - ,
“Cue” ; The trail of the “pictures” was over
the Westralian trial of a young woman for
the killing of a ship's engineer, alleged to have
seduced and then jilted her, at a Government
House ball in Perth. There was no question
about the shooting, and had it _ occurred
in less hectic days, when the movies didn’t
put notions into silly young heads, insanity
would probably have been the defence; but
counsel for the prisoner took another line.
The gist of it was that the girl had been
publicly snubbed at the ball by her > “be-
trayer,” and that she went home and picked
up a revolver, determined to take her own life,
but thought better of it. Then she returned
to the ballroom (with the revolver), mid
sent a message to the ship’s engineer the
living embodiment of the Sheik,” counsel
explained—who again repulsed her. “Some-
thing snapped in her brain,” and she was
raising her hand to her head when she was
shocked by the sound of an explosion. It
was purely an accident. The Judge told the
jury that “unwritten law” had no existence
in Australian jurisprudence, but after three
hours’ retirement the panel returned with a
verdict of acquittal. After which, it is re-
lated, the triumphant counsel took the young
lady to her home and was there met by her
young sister, who calmly announced that she
did not require to be told about the verdict—
she had seen it flashed on the screen at the
pitchers.

“H.1.M.”: The pithiest comment I ever-
heard on Turkish marksmanship was directed
at “Beachy Bill’s” gunners when they put
one in the sea among the bathers instead of
on the beach. Quoth one exasperated
Digger as he scrambled ashore and took
cover behind a dump of cases: “You cows
can’t even hit the country you were born in.”
“X.R.N.”: “A.G.R.” (B. l/10/’25) ex-
plains the origin of the practice of lowering
ensigns at sunset in the R.N. The firing
of the gun, by the way, has been discon-
tinued, and its place taken by a round of
.303 blank fired by the sentry on the fore-
bridge. And, incidentally, the ceremony now
takes place only in harbor. What would
be interesting to know is the origin of the
“one-gun salute” which is fired at the time
colors are hoisted in the morning by a. ship in
which a court-martial is to sit during the
day. Why also does such a ship fly a Union
Jack at the yard-arm while the court is sit-
ing?

“O.B.”: Thinking that Federal Govern-
ment House, St. Kilda-road, Melbourne, was
in danger of being given over to ghosts of
former pro-consuls, Vic. Public Library
trustees asked for permission to have a look
at it to see if it was,-fit for a museum or an
adjunct of some Mud. Chief Sec. Argylo
told them there was no harm in having a
look, but explained that nothing had been
decided as to what would be done with the
place when Lord Stonehaven went to Can-
berra. Works Minister Goudie, who wilt
resume jurisdiction over the premises when
the Federals vacate it, was quick to point
out that it would be cheaper to resume
occupancy for the State Government than
to go on paying £5OOO a year in rent and
up-keep for Stonington, Malvern, after the
lease expires in April, 1928. Besides, he
suggested, his Ex. of Vic. will be a bigger
somebody when not overshadowed in Mel-
bourne by a Federal Excellency. And per-
haps he will—if there are any State Exes,
in those days.
“A.R.H.”: Talking about busy bride-
grooms, I know a farmer who milked his
cows on his wedding-day, took a load of
chaff to town, delivered it, drove the empty
waggon to church, and was made a benedict.
Then he brought his wife home on the
waggon. The same night hubby and bride
milked the cows.

“Ex-Dig.”: Photography and electric
transmission have made another advance in
preparation for the next war. Experiments
in America have shown that an airman can
take photographs, drop them at a transmis-
sion station and have the pictures delivered
by wire wherever they are wanted within
half an hour; in the actual experiment aerial
photographs of Fort Leavenworth, in Kan-
sas, were inspected in Chicago and San
Francisco within the time stated. The ad-
vance may have peaceful uses, but this sort
of intelligence makes the infantryman shiver.
The transmission of photographs by wire
had another triumph in America recently.
A young girl disappeared from her home-
town, and was believed to be making for
Philadelphia. That same evening her photo-
graph was flashed upon the screens of the
picture theatres in that city, and the child,
promptly recognised by some of the picture
patrons on her arrival the next morning, was
escorted homeward in the afternoon.

“Chancery”: Is this a record? It has
just made its appearance in the Melbourne
Divorce Court. On the wife’s return to. her
husband’s farm —she had been on a holiday
in Melbourne —she. found him with another
woman, who gave birth to a child. She over-
looked this indiscretion, but shortly after-
wards a widow called to explain that she
also had one of his children. The good-
natured wife overlooked this error of judg-
ment, too. Later on a summons arrived for
the maintenance of another child, and the
man admitted that he was its father; in all.
he said candidly, there were 13 of them.
After a moment of anger the lady readjusted
her halo and wings and poured out some
more forgiveness; but a couple of years ago
the husband floundered in the bog of his own
making, and the wife had to take her own
five children to live with her people. When
she presently discovered that hubby was still
adding to the bog she reached the bound-
aries of her forgiveness, decided that his con -
duct was something more than amiable
weakness, and commenced a suit for divorce.
“Xuaved”: The lone-handed female joy-
rider has turned up in Adelaide. Finding a
motor-car left in the street, she got in
and drove off. She had not travelled very
far before she ran the car into the garden-
hedge of a worthy citizen, who indignantly
came out and demanded an explanation.
Soft answers from flic, fair driver turned
away his wrath so effectively that an invita-
tion to come in and have some afternoon
tea was proffered and accepted. After tea
the car was extricated from the hedge and
the young woman, profuse in her thanks,
drove off again, only to meet further dis-
aster in the shape of a telegraph-post. Aid
was offered to the damsel in distress by
sympathetic passers-by, but she smilingly
declined any help and set off on foot to
ring up a garage. She has not been tracked,
and the owner is now paying for the repairs.

OCTOBER.
[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
Here walks brave October
All yellow with broom,
New flushing the sober
Brown shadows and gloom,
Where great trees lean over
The bushes that burn
And the blue-wren, a rover,
Makes shrill his return.
The winds, ill begotten,
That shrieked from the west
Are all but forgotten
This morning of rest.
The tree trunks have pleasure
From branches to roots;
The sun takes their measure
For new Christmas suits.
The bark feels like stripping
On red gum and grey;
The lyre-bird is skipping
And talking all day.
And, dry without thunder,
No rain at its heart,
The sky seems to wonder
When bush-fires will start.

BLUE TRAMS.
[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
“The Commissioners have experimentally painted a
few Sydney tram-ears blue.”
It is carnival in street-land, where the yellow tabs
appear
Like bright hornets, while the petrol meets the
fragrance of the beer.
There the gay October sunshine shines on fashion’s
garments few,
And amid the jazz of traffic comes the merry tram
in blue.
There may soon be trams in purple, trams in green
and puce and pink
And a score of other colors to make sober eyelids
blink ;
And no doubt the pride of beauty on the lines will
have its due,
Though we feel a little startled at the tram in
butcher’s blue.
By the kerbstone grey and gritty we shall see the
pageant pass.
And a stoppage will look splendid when the shining
colors mass;
But we’ll tread eai h other’s bluchers in the way we
always knew
While we hang, with azure language, to the straps
behind the blue!

“Aek" : This was quick work. A motor-
ambulance waggon was recently presented to
Horsham and district (Vic.) by the Edward
Wilson Trust. The ceremony of. handing
over was in full swung, and the shire presi-
dent was weighing out the appropriate sugar,
when a call came through that the ambulance
wms wanted some miles out. The driver
jerked the motor into action, and within half
an hour had lodged a serious case in the hos-
pital.

“Costs": Years ago children used _to be
regarded as an insurance against divorce;
it was rarely that people with large families
figured in this jurisdiction. In Melbourne
the Fouquet v. Fouquet suit, however, re-
vealed 12 children; and that must be a
record tribe to troop into an Australian
divorce court. Still, the suits in which a
number of children are mentioned are fre-
quent. Probably it is a result of the femi-
nist movement. In the old days a woman
wuth many children was prepared to suffer
what to-day is generally regarded as insuffer-
able. And it is not always the woman who
is solely responsible ; in an increasing number
of cases the children have obviously taken a
hand. Yet woman is probably less
happy with all her advantages than she was
when she didn’t have them.

“Caractacus”; Versatility, as well as
casualness, must be an Australian trait. In
our Melbourne suburb —probably typical of
many—one of the leading drapers is a bar-
rister, solicitor and LL.B.; two doctors)
started as schoolteachers; the leading parson
was once a printer. One ex-bankmanager
has a thriving business as financier and
estate-agent, another as a chaff merchant.
A carpenter has dropped the claw-hammer
for the architect’s gavel; the general-man-
ager of a store resigned to become an editor;
two ex-grocers are respectively a carrier
and a theatre-manager; one printer became
a saddler, then an auctioneer, then a saddler

again. The town-clerk was an estate-agent;
a big haulier started as a baker; the ser-
geant of police was a journalist.. An ex-
vaudeville artist is a mercer; a big timber-
merchant graduated from the tip-dray; the
owner of a universal-providery began as a
timber-merchant; a blacksmith founded a
chemical works; four stationers were re-
spectively a stevedore, a draper, a meat-
packer and a factory engineer, and another
stationer sold out to buy a wood-and-coal
business. A painter became a commission-
agent ; a butcher a moneylender ; and a rail-
way porter has built up a huge connection
as a psychiatrist and practitioner of mani-
pulative healing. A photographer and a
second-hand dealer run as side-lines por-
traiture in oils.

“Gouger”: A wedding-ring that promises
to age into an heirloom was lately slipped
on the finger of a bonny northern bush
Pride. The gold was panned off in a Queens-
land creek over 30 years ago. and an Aus-
tralian jeweller moulded it into a ring for
the miner’s wife. On the day the couple
bought their farm the ring disappeared. The
young wife had been cleaning it, and being
hurriedly called away left it on the sewing-
machine at the open window. Search was
unavailing. Sixteen years later the eldest
boy found a dirt-coated metal ring in a
bower-bird’s nest in a dark patch of scrub
a mile from the house. When her boy went
off to the war the mother sewed the ring in
a tiny bag and tied it round his neck. The
boy went through four years of war un-
scathed. Through them and the years that
since have passed the ring never left him
until a month ago. Now he smilingly says
it only left his neck to rest against his
heart.

“Clerk”: Victoria’s most fastidious
laborer has just been unearthed at the Mel-
bourne railway goods-sheds. A casual hand,
attired in a blue suit, came in with the after-
noon shift and was allotted to a gang. He
then retired to the workmen’s lockers, divested
himself of his coat, waistcoat and trousers,
and trundled his truck on to the floor of the
shed, clad airily in underpants, shirt and
boots. A shocked foreman inquired the rea-
son for such a display of lingerie, and was
told that he (the casual hand) wasn't going
to spoil his clothes for any flaming job—
or words to that effect. The foreman insisted
on a pair of trousers, whereupon the
laborer, persisting in his refusal to soil his
clothes, cast his truck from him and quitted
with disdain. If he’d only been a seaman,
the country might by now have been agitated
by a strike against the tyranny of the capi-
talist in compelling the downtrodden worker
to wear pants on the job.

“The Wowser”: The Kaiser-I-llind was
on the point of leaving Southampton with
the returning A.I.F. squadrons in May, 1919.
when a big six-foot Queenslander strolled
up the gangway. He had a bran-bag slung
oyer his shoulder instead of the usual kit-
bag, and there seemed to be something heavy
in it. But it was surprising how blind the
officials at that gangway w r ere; they saw
nothing out of the ordinary in the Digger's
load. When the bag was emptied between
decks a small Belgian lad fell out, and for a
week or two only took exercise at night.
Later, after Port Said was passed, he
appeared openly amongst the mob. The last
I heard of him lie was in the Air Force.
“Elsie Ghee”: Drowsing in a side-pocket
of the Middle Diggings of Victoria, the tiny
village of Tarnagulla is protesting against
its sliire-council’s proposal to dismantle and
sell its town hall. Tarnagulla is in the heart
of what was one of the most hectic districts
of the Roaring Days. A few 7 miles away is
Moliagul, where the Welcome Nugget, the
world’s biggest, was found; Mclntyre’s, once
a “ridge of gold”; Poseidon, scene of an
extraordinary gold discovery as late as 1908;
Dunolly, for long the terminus of the State s
main “gold-line.” In the early ’sixties Tar-
nagulla had 30,000 townsfolk and a main
street a mile long. The street is still there,
bordered with giant gums up to 4ft. in
diameter, but with only about five occupied
shops. There still remain relics of a race-
course, a town reservoir and water-reticula-
tion system, four solidly-built churches,
sports-ground and grandstand, Masonic hall,
an endowed free library and the town hall—
a remodelled hotel containing offices, council
chamber and lodge-room. The old town has
fought hard for life. Ten years ago it still
retained its quaint municipal council, town
clerk and officers, but was forced to merge
itself into the nearest shire as a mere riding.
Now it is threatened with the loss of its last
symbol of autonomy. It is well within pro-
bability that the scrub may yet wholly cover,
as it now partly overwhelms, the spot where
30,000 hard-bitten diggers roared in the dear,
dead days.

didate. Under the present system of con-
ducting examinations, especially the public
exams., substitution is easy and practically
without risk. The plan followed is to post
up outside the place where the test is to
take place a list of those sitting, with a
number against each name, this number be-
ing the only distinguishing mark placed on
the papers handed in. It is a simple matter
for some youth who does not feel that he
can satisfy the examiners to engage some-
body to whom the questions would be easy,
and all that the substitute has to do is to
ascertain his number from the list, and then
put it on the papers. Short of photograph-
ing every candidate, or recording his or her
Bertillon measurements, it is difficult to see
how the risk of such substitution is to be
removed entirely. Still, a start might be
made by obtaining a sample of the handwrit-
ing of everybody sitting, and keeping it for
purposes of comparison should any doubt
arise.
“To T.rg.'.t.’. l';a“ : “Hullin Griffin's” par.
(B. 3/9/'25) about the man who left his
Union Jack out all night reminds me of a
flag incident which occurred in Auckland a
good many years ago. James Morton, an
auctioneer of the “right-thinking” order, made
a practice of flying the blue ensign on a
staff in front of his mart. An officer from
11.M.5. Blanche, paying one of its periodi-
cal visits to the port, cast indignant eyes on
the desecrated emblem. Hastening back to
the ship, he reported the outrage, and returning
presently at the head of an armed party of
bluejackets and marines, hauled down the
flag, which was confiscated.
* * * *
“C.W.” : The recent case of young Wink-
ler, who was tried arid sentenced to death for
giving his sick father the revolver with which
he shot himself, was not the only instance
of the sort in N. S. Wales. Back in 1835
a woman at Penrith while under the influ-
ence of drink hanged herself. She was
assisted out of the world by her husband, for
his own relief and hers. He was clearly
more worthy of blame than Fred Winkler,
and the jury found him guilty of wilful
murder. James Backhouse, who records the
circumstance, in his “Narrative of a Visit
to the Australian Colonies,” says that the
man was respited until the opinion of Eng-
lish judges upon such a case had been re-
ceived. The opinion had not come to hand
before Backhouse left Sydney, and he was
unable to say how the man fared. In Wink-
ler’s case the responsibility for the verdict
of wilful murder lay with the jury, who
wanted him to be set free as a first offender.
They didn’t know that the Judge had no
option but to pass the death sentence, and it
was left to the Executive to set the youth
free.
“X.D.”: A good deal of fuss was made
by some of the Sydney papers recently over
the discovery in the possession of an arrested
thug of a heavy lead weight attached to a
length of elastic in such a way that, after
a blow had been dealt with it, it flew up the
user's sleeve. Actually this weapon has been
common in both
Sydney and Mel-
bourne for years
past, and some
time ago was em-
ployed for it s
effect in one of the
marked anesthetic
sporadic Fitzroy
(Melbourne) ven-
dettas. So far as
its hypnotic pro-
perties are con-
cerned, it is no bet-
ter than an iron
bar or a soda-water
bottle in a stocking
—probably not as
good as either of
these. But it has
the advantage of
disappearing out of
sight a second after
it has been used,
and so removing
any awkward evi-
dence should the
police appear sud-
denly on the scene.
It is not wielded
in the same man-
ner as a sling-shot,
as stated by one of
the reporters who
described it, but is
held in the closed
hand, being oval-
shaped. and just
big enough to set
comfortably in this
position, so that
when the holder of
it strikes an oppo-
nent on the jaw,
the recipient of the
punch experiences
all the sensations
of a five-storeyed
building collapsing
on his face, and
takes no more interest in what is going on
around him. Employed in this way, it
should leave no mark on the victim’s conn
tenance.

“George Street" : Who said the day of the
great cathedrals was over and the faitli that
made them gone for ever? From New York
comes a proposal to erect on Broadway a
temple taller than any of them. The build-
ing is to be 24 storeys high and to contain a
church, hotel, department stores, tvyo apart-
ment houses, public offices and dining halls,
all under a revolving cross of light. The
cathedral-builders had lofty ideas, but never
thought of anything quite like that. The
stores arc to occupy the front on Broadway,
but past the drapery counters the atmosphere
of holiness is to begin and be a “substantial
reminder of the Holy Presence,” though
flanked on each side by merely mundane flats
and eating-places. As the promoters say:
“A 5 per cent, investment in your Fellow
Man’s Salvation, Broadway Temple is to be
a combination of Church and Skyscraper,
Beligion and Revenue, Salvation and 5 per
cent.- —and the 5 per cent, is based on ethical

Christian grounds.” The cost is to bo
4,000,000 dollars; and an estimate is given
of the revenue, showing that the stores, apart-
ment houses and hotel are expected to return
125,000 dollars annually. As this amount
is far short of 5’ per cent, on cost, presum-
ably the collection-plate is expected to make
up the deficit; or is the hope that the re-
moval of prohibition will permit of the
establishment of a bar for selling holy
spirits?
TWENTY-THREE.
[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
I wonder if anyone else can be
As happy as I at twenty-three!
Voice I have none and my face is plain,
Yet 1 wouldn’t be twenty-two again—
Not for the skies and the moon therein,
Not for a comical coon therein!
(And 1 sometimes think ’tis a coon therein
A comical mouth and a spoon therein.)
J haven’t an act or a sin to rue.
I’ve done the things that I wanted to do;
And 1 couldn’t say that at twenty-two -
No, 1 couldn’t say that at twenty-two!
Oh, 1 sing my songs ; but I sing with words
The song of the trees and the lovely birds,
The sea and its ships, the stars at night,
The harvest moons that are pale and bright!
The cynics will say: “You have gone amiss ;
Why, at twenty-two you could do all this! ’
Ah, little they know of the joy of me
When I thank my God to be twenty-three ;
Yes, thank my God as 1 ought to do —-
For I wasn’t in love at twenty-two!

Prof. Wood-Jones (Uni.), Edgar Waite
(Museum) and Drs. Joseph Verco and Pul-
leine have formed a small Adelaide commit-
tee to finance David Unaipon, the cultured
South Aus. abo.. and enable him to devote his
life to studying the customs of his own people.
It is thought that he will be simply invalu-
able as a go-between, having totem and other
rights which outsiders could get only as a
compliment, if at all. He claims, for a start,
that the aboriginals have extraordinary tele-
pathic powers. He himself can impress on
the mind of his own brother at a distance the
fact that he is coming home on a given date,
but others have a power far more general.
He is positive, for instance, that smoke-
signals are not a language, but a means of
“calling up,” and that mental concentration
sends the message after attention has been
requested by the smoke.
A. B. Piddington, K.C., is assiduously
cultivating Queensland. Frequent visits,
newspaper articles and interviews keep him
before the public, so that he is better knowrn
np north than in N. S. Wales. So far he
has got nothing in return except little jobs
such as preparing the trade unions’ case for
the Economic Commission and drafting the
Government’s child endowment scheme (now
abandoned). His name was mentioned for
the Chief Justiceship before Blair was
appointed, and again when it was proposed
to appoint two more Judges to the Arbitra-
tion Court. No doubt something worth
while will be found for him in the end.

Melba talks of entering politics when she
returns. If she can win a seat she will be
the first woman to do it in Victoria. The few
—from Vida Goldstein to Jean Daley—who
have tried have failed. And even Melba may
have to be content with A.W.N.L. work; or
she might get a seat in the shire council in
which Coombe Cottage, her home beyond
Lilydale, is situate —Vic. has one woman
councillor, at any rate.
John Gellibrand, who commanded the 12th
Battalion, the 6th and 12th Brigades and
the 3rd Division between April 25, 1915,
and November 11, 191 S, is to be Laborite
Dave O’Keefe’s opponent for the Denison
(otherwise Hobart) seat in the House of
Reps., and O’Keefe is disturbed at the pros-
pect. Three years ago he beat Edward Mul-
cahy by a mere 91 votes in a poll of 11,247,
after being 389 behind on first preferences,
and the quiet Digger with the barrowload of
decorations—D.S.O. (for Gallipoli) with bar
(for Bulleeonrt), C. 8., K.C.8., Officer of the
Legion of Honor, Croix de Guerre avec
Palme, U.S. Distinguished Service Medal
and the S’Afriean Medal with two clasps—
will get support in Quarters to which Mul-
cahy, though an ex-Senator like O’Keefe,
appealed in vain. Certainly the correspond-
ing State electorate returned four Laborites
and two Nationalists at the general election
in June, but the State Nationalists w T ere a
leaderless mob.
Alfred Searcy, whose recollections of C.
C. Kingston and the first Federation draft
The Bulletin was giving last week, died
in Adelaide a day or two later, at 71, after
being a servant of the public for about half
a century. He started as a Customs board-
ing officer, in the ’eighties was sent to Dar-
win as Collector, put in 14 years there and
—on the strong suggestion of Louis Bccke
and Frank Bullen—made several interesting
books. Ever since returning to Adelaide he
has been, as Clerk of Parliament, a guide
and friend to generations of politicians.

J. A. G. Hamilton, dead in Adelaide at 70,
was one of a brilliant band of medical
brothers. He came from Ireland as a young
man, and his Ouida-guardsman style com-
bined with his great skill to make him one
of Adelaide’s most popular doctors. Gynae-
cology was his strong point, and lie' had
charge of that department at the Adelaide
Hospital for many years; also he was one
of the earliest experts in appendicitis opera-
tions. In private life he was a horse-lover,
driving, exhibiting and racing; for years he
was honorary surgeon to S.A. Jockey Club
and Adelaide Racing Club. On retiring in
1920 he spent several years in Westralia,
but came back to Adelaide, badly broken
down in health, to end his days.
The grandfather amongst the Federal can-
didates will be Edward Muleahy, 75, who is
trying to get back as a Tasmanian Senator.
Muleahy was brought to Australia when he
was four, and his political career extended
from 1891 to 1920—as a State politician till
1902, as a Commonwealth Senator up to
1910, and then again as a member of the
State Parliament (with a short interval fol-
lowing a defeat) until 1919, when he was
appointed by the State Parliament to fill
a death vacancy in the Senate.
Priminister Bruce chose as his publicity
agent for the Federal elections Cecil
Edwards, a bright man who does the Federal
political work for the Melbourne Sun
Pictorial. He is to tour Australia with the
Priminister. As a relief from the political-
dope writing, Edwards takes an interest in
the art of the theatre. He recently finished
the lyrics of a comic opera called “Alaya,”
the book written by another Melbourne Inky-
way man, Erskine Wyse; the music by Mrs.
Reck Daley, who has taken it to London,
where she hopes to have it produced. The
opera is set in Australia and Corsica.
Almost anybody who visits Macßobert-
son’s factory in Melbourne may, if Aus-
tralia’s reputedly biggest taxpayer is not too
busy to see him, interview the man who
started making confectionery in a nail-can,
using his mother’s bathroom as his work-
shop. At 66 Macpherson Robertson begins
the day by having a few turns with the skip-
ping-rope and a spar with the punching-
ball ; after that, work is his hobby. When
he received an offer of two millions and a
half for his business (he says he would not
sell it now for four millions) there was one
insuperable objection. “Where am I going
to get another job?” he said.
T. Ronayne, formerly general manager of
M.L. railways, left Wellington to visit the
Clydevale colliery, of which he was a direc-
tor, and the weather beiim rough and the
roads bad, decided to travel to the mine on
the aerial ropeway. He was in a coal tub.
and when a rather violent hailsshorerw r er came
along he tried to cover his head with a sack;
this caught the U-shaped catch that holds
the tub upright and released it, with the
result that he was flung 25-feet and killed.
Ronayne took charge of the Helensvillo
works in 1875; later he was in charge of
works at Greymouth and superintended the
first shipment of coal from that port.
Men on every goldfield in Australia and
che islands will be sorry to hear that Dan
Pryke is dead, aged 68. Dan was one of
a family of great prospectors: he himself
was a pioneer of Westralian fields, and was
also well ltnowm in North Queensland and
Papua, where he helped to open up the Gira
and other districts. He was a man of fine
physique and great courage, and he had a
personality that made fast friends.
“lan C.” : I daresay the late Tommy Bent,
ex-Premier of Vic., helped to implant the
notion in England that Australians are the
most confirmed tea-drinkers on earth. “Caf-
feine’s” yarn (B. l/10/’25) reminded me
that Bent, lunching with royalty at Buck-
ingham Palace, demanded tea when asked by
Jeames what tipple he would take. He got
it, of course, although the shock was almost
too much for Jeames.
J. E. Fenton, one of the few uncompro-
mising Protectionists in the Federal Labor
party, is strongly entrenched in Maribyrnong
(Vic.), but if Major T. White can shift him
a son-in-law of Alfred Deakin will be in Par-
liament. White, who controls an engineer-
ing firm, served in the war as a flying-man,
became a major, was captured by the Turks,
and wrote some fine stuff for The Bulletin
while in captivity. He was allowed to write
only six lines at a time; but there was no
limit to the width of the paper. White used
a sheet 3ft. wide, and his Turkish captors
were sports enough to pass it. He escaped
towards the end of the war, and got to
Russia, thence making his way to England.
Mournful was the statement of Alexander
Poynton, sometime Postmaster-General and
Minister for Home and Territories, that he
was prevented from having a cut at A. W.
Lacey for the Grey (S.A.) seat in the House
of Reps, by “the disability I suffer because of
my, operation.” However, the old man, a
unionist from 1879 till the Conscription
period and legislator for 29 years, is still
able to set down what he thinks of the
Walshes, .Tohansons and Gardens w r ho have
shot up in Australian unionism since the
war, and his opinion is not flattering. Poyn-
ton, now 72, is a native of Castlemaine
(Vie.). One of the original S. Aus. Repre-
sentatives, he was M.H.11. for Grey from
1903 till 1922.
The war didn’t see the end of the Aus-
tralian bushman’s flair for digging himself
out of a mess. The other day an axeman
named Guphart was cutting dow r n scrub at
Tully (Q.), when he tripped in some under-
growth and fell. Before he could rise the
tree he had been engaged on fell and pinned
him down with a broken leg. A mate rushed
away to telephone for the ambulance, which
arrived in due course, and took the injured
man to hospital. But before it came he
had managed to chop the tree away from
his leg and had torn his trousers up and
made ligatures to stop the haunorrhage. When
the ambulance arrived the* job was so far
done that he was calmly smoking a cigarette.
“Chliota Peg”: Stanley Lewis and J. M.
Cullity have represented the captains and the
crews respectively in the recent proceedings
against British seamen in the Melbourne City
Court. Lewis, small and almost bird-like in
his movements, strongly recalls Dion Bouci-
cault, and exhibits an air of horrified sur-
prise that the defence should think for a
moment of trying to explain or mitigate the
men’s faults. Cullity, on the other hand,
tall, dark and ascetic looking, fights man-
fully to prove that his clients have been
forced by intolerable working conditions into
the steps they have taken, and assumes in
his cross-examination of ships’ officers a hec-
toring attitude which led at least one of his
victims to express the wish that he could
have the counsel for the defence on the
quartei’-deck for an hour.
Thomas W T alter Hislop, M.L.C., of Maori-
land, dead at 75, was a rough and forceful
pioneer with Oamaru as his home town. Soon
after moving to Wellington he joined Alfred
de Bathe Brandon in legal work, and the firm
is one of the oldest in the country. Hislop
was a Minister in the Atkinson Govern-
ment, but his more notable public work was
done as Mayor of Wellington, where he
developed the suburbs of Island Bay and
Kilbirnie by pushing the tram services out
to these places. In politics Francis Beil
and Robert Stout were his contemporaries,
but they outstripped him while he turned his
attention to municipal affairs. If he had had
a more gracious manner he might have gone
further; yet at heart he was kindness itself,
and no youngster with a scheme for progress
or an invention ever appealed to him for
advice in vain, for even as an old man he
always hankered after new ideas.

ihe seafaring life of Captain George Wal-
lace, who at IJ6 still earns his crust as night-
watchman on the Williainstown-Port Mel-
bourne ferry Rosny, began 83 years ago;
he was quite a salted sailorman by the time
he took part in the Crimean War as one of
the crew of the Rodney. He was wounded
there in both legs. In the same Rodney he
had an early experience of Australia, which
expanded later when he toiled on some of
the immigrant ships. It is only ten years
ago (he was 86 at the time) that the
veteran made his last voyage, in charge of a
three-masted schooner from England to Bris-
bane ; then failing eyesight made him seek a
shore job. He is still tough ; even a fall of
17ft. when the Rosny was in dry dock re-
cently* failed to put him out of action.
Ninety-two years on October 19 since
Adam Lindsay Gordon was born at Fayal, in
the Azores. The poet landed at Adelaide in
1853, and was a member of the S. Aus.
Parliament from March, 1865, to November,
1866.
One hundred years ago on October 31 next
that remarkable Australian woman Cather-
ine Helen Spence was born at Melrose, Scot-
land. Miss Spence, who died at Adelaide
aged 84, was a notable advocate of women’s
franchise and various reforms, including
“effective” voting.
Fifty years ago this month Mother Gon-
zaga Barry led the first contingent of seven
Loreto Sisters from Rathfarnham, Ireland,
to Ballarat, on the invitation of the late
Bishop O’Connor. Three of the pioneers
are_ still living. Mother Dorothea Frizell
is in charge of the Training School at Bal-
larat ; Mother Margaret Hughes is at
Toorak; Sister Bruno is in N. S. Wales.
The Loreto nuns in the half-century have
established 11 “houses” in the Common-
wealth, and trained more than 200 nuns.
Talbot Smith’s tribute to an old namesake:
O. E. Owen Smyth (he always insisted on being
called “Smith”) dropped into Adelaide somewhere
about 1876, and took root. He brought Irish blood
with a Welsh strain, a lot of experience at sea and
some knowledge of the building trade. He was first
in the Architect-in-Chief’s department; then the post
of Superintendent of Public Buildings was made for
him, and to it he gave the rest of his career—43
years. As he was a born manager of men, all sorts
of things were left to him. Every occupant of Gov-
ernment House had to get on the right side of Owen
Smyth whenever a fresh coat of paint or anything of
the kind was requested. He was one of the only
three men who ever cared to oppose Chief Justice Way
openly, fixing the new Art Gallery site right up
against the University boundary when Way wanted
it in the middle of the Public Library block. “What
am I keeping the middle free for?” said Owen
Smyth to me. “I don’t know. But everything is
going to be different in years to come. Look here,
would you have believed, five years ago, that you
would ever see your wife riding down North-terrace
on a bicycle?” (This fixes the date as about
1896.) “Well, there are more surprising things
coming, and I’m going to keep that fine frontage
open.” And he did. A prominent citizen said to
me: “If there could be the shadow of an idea that
he did for his own benefit such things as he does,
he wouldn’t last a week ; but the transparent honesty
of the man carries him through.” He retired to
England in 1920, but could not stand either the
weather or the politics there, and was soon back
to end his days. In private life he was a pillar
of the Anglican Church, a great game-shot, and an
authority on everything connected with Napoleon.
His son fell on Gallipoli with mine. Peace to their
ashes!
THE SELF-PROTECTIONIST.
[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
“The complaint is made that some Australian
manufacturers do not themselves support Australian
- industries.”
His faith in good Australian soap
Was very strong indeed.
He made the stuff and, filled with hope,
Declared his loyal creed.
But when it came to buying socks,
He always chose a pair
From showy large imported stocks
On offer everywhere.
He always swore that English tweed
Alone would suit his style;
The local stuff looked well indeed,
But never seemed worth while.
The men employed about his place
Were all imported, too;
He liked the sons of Scottish race
As long as they were new.
Australian manufacturers must
Have men well-trained, he said.
He did not like to place his trust
In those Australian bred.
So, living ’mid imported thought,
And helping foreign trade,
He spoke his praise of those who sought
For things Australian-made.
The suds that made his wheels go round
Were still his constant care
That ready money’ might be found
To buy imported ware.

FULL MARKS.
TEACHER : “If a farmer sold 5000 bushels of wheat at 6s. per bushel,
what would he get?”
PUPIL: “Please, Miss, a Ford!”
“Kobbi” : Australia’s abo. is blessed with.
or cursed in, many aliases, from the quasi-classical
“Binghi” to the modestly plain “Nigger.” In some
icorners, especially in the cattle country of the
Burnett (Q.), 1 have heard them referred, to as
■“the Murrays.” Does anyone know what is at
the back of this title? The only solution I can
offer is that in the Narnoi dialect the equivalent for
“man” was “muree,” and national slovenliness of
speech probably did the rest. Still from Namoi
country to the Burnett is more than a boomerang
throw.
* * * *
“Din”: Whilst in search of firewood I
came upon the remains of a big ironbark which
had been splintered by lightning. I passed a vote
of thanks to the electricity for saving me a lot
of axe work and filled my cart. Next day the
missus blamed a late dinner to the wood I’d brought.
She couldn’t get it to burn, nor could I. It’s dry
and does not look different from other wood in
the yard, yet even when mixed with good burning
stuff it just smoulders to ashes. Why ? Apparently
the lightning has affected it in some way.
* * * *
“Wingella”: The jumping snake recently
referred to is probably a small lizard known
in the N.T. as the organ-grinder. It is a lace lizard
with a very long, thin, whip-like tail, and has a
habit of sitting up on its hind legs and “grinding
the organ” furiously with its right front leg.
Sometimes it stops to scratch its ear with its hind
claw and then starts grinding again. When startled
it scuttles off on its hind legs at a rapid rate,
holding itself so erect that one is constantly ex-
pecting it to topple over backwards. This lizard
clears small logs at a single jump, so possibly
it started fhe yarn of the jumping snake.
* * * *
Tips in ring-barking gums:—
“Spenner”: Finish each blow of the axe on the
underside of the ring with a flick of the handle so
that the bark is forced away from the wood for a
few inches down the trunk. This will result in
SO per cent, deaths with no shoots whatever.
“Diggeroo” : Make your blows clean and quick, but
not too hard. The ideal is to get rid of the bark
cleanly without cutting into the sapwood. The
roots of trees so treated are starved, and the
trees die slowly but surely. A few will make new
bark to feed the roots and a few more will sucker
when the axe bites too deep. Such failures will
not be the fault of the method, but of the work-
manship.
* * * *
“Elby” : A simple devic-e for the destruc-
tion of eagle-hawks, just now' proving themselves a
menace to sheep-farmeis by carrying off young lambs,
has been used with great success by a grazier near
Nevertire (N.S.W.). His plan is to make a wire-
netting enclosure about 4ft. high, to place three or
four half-grown fowls inside and to set 10 or 12
rabbit-traps, some close to the netting, and others
a sufficient, distance away to stop the hawk when
caught from flapping the traps off with its wings.
On one property alone 96 hawks, large enough to
carry a lamb each, have been trapped in a few days
by this method.
“Stellsby": I am in search of a remedy
for egg-stealing by my fox-terrier, Peter. Strange
to say, he doesn't eat the eggs, but having stolen
one streaks for the front lawn. There he rolls on
his back, gets the egg. between his forepaws and
plays with it. I’ve thrashed the blighter, and trapped
him with eggs doctored with mustard and pepper,
but all to no purpose. How can I cure him?
* * * *
“Jarrali” : Some say that white and black
cockatoos will not live in close proximity to each
other, but my experience disproves this statement.
On a broken, decayed red-gum which was a mass of
hollows and stood on a steep and rugged hill above
a tributary of the Warren River (W.A.), I saw a
great number of black cockatoos nesting. Alongside
was another red-gum in which a host of white
cockatoos had made their home. They- were all
talking volubly, but seemed to be living in perfect
amity, though each color confined itself to its own
tree.
* * * *
“Kriz” : There arc fewer deaths than there
used to be from paralysis among the Japanese divers
in the pearling fleet
working out of Broome
(W.A.). The five
deaths from paralysis
during the 1924 season
is in striking contrast
to the 33 that Occurred
in 1914. The lowest
rate for a season’s
operations over a
period of 10 years was
in 1918, when only one
passed out; next to
that came 1922, with
two deaths. The de-
compression chamber
(ashore), which used
to work overtime a few
years ago, is now
rarely used, for upon
a diver showing signs
of sickness action is
taken on the spot—-
such as suspension in
the water at varying
depths. The prompt
treatment of partially-
paralysed divers on the
vessel, instead of tak-
ing- them ashore, probably accounts for the decreasing
rate.
* * * *
“Keppel” : Telephone linesmen are having
trouble from magpies building their nests on the
lines with pieces of wire, etc., and thus short-circuit-
ing the current. The trunk line between Ulmarra and
South Grafton (N.S.W.) was recently put out of
commission in this way three times in as many
days. One obstinate magpie insisted on building its
nest on a telephone post between the wires. The
first nest, made mostly of wire-netting and galvan-
ised wire, was removed and thrown away. Next day
the nest was started again from the same material,
and when found was thrown into the river. Nothing
daunted, the persistent bird scoured the country,
found other wire and again started on the nest.
Some of the material was 18in. long-, so the carrying
must have been a strenuous job.
* * * *
“J.H.S.”: No more cruel way of taking
a ’possum could be devised than the steel-wire
snare in general use. This simple, innocent-looking
contrivance—a running noose attached to a lean-
ing pole placed against a tree —frequently not only
frightfully lacerates the hapless victim, thus seri-
ously damaging the pelt, but kills him by slow
strangulation, unless, as occasionally happens, the
wretched creature is fortunate enough to be caught
round the neck. Generally, the snared ’possum, with
a biting wire cutting deeply around its flanks or
thorax, is still alive when the trapper goes his
round in the morning. Then again, thousands of
animals break the snares, and, with the noose
drawn tight about them, crawl away to die a
lingering death in the long grass or in the hollow
of some tree. Of the hundreds of thousands of
tiny baby ’possums destroyed each trapping season,
the less said fhe better.
“Bullwhanger”: The finest island out-
riggers are those built at Stewart atoll (Sicaiana), a
small speck about 100 miles off the coast of Malaita.
Their hulls are beautifully modelled out of some
soft, white, buoyant wood, and are about 25ft. ro
30ft. long. The boat is a dugout, the opening in
the top being very narrow, and it has a strong high
coaming. The outrigger float is of the same wood
ONE OF THE THINGS SHE LEFT BEHIND HER.
FRIEND : “Gome, man, try and forget it.”
WIDOWER : “I tried, but the undertaker’s bill has woke it up again worsc than ever."
as the hull, the crosspieces being of hardwood. They
behave beautifully in a seaway, and 1 have,: come
through a nasty surf on the reef in one, with four
or five hefty Sicaiana “boys” making her fly, with-
out shipping a drop of water. The people are
Polynesians, and what they don’t know about boat-
handling in salt water isn’t worth knowing.
* * * *
“Redraw" : The black duck, as a rule, nests
in swamps, but I have seen the nest of one in a
pine-tree three miles from water. 1 have also
seen a wood-duck shift her brood from a hollow-,
limb to the water underneath. She took them on
her back one at a time and flew down.
“Numb”: The wood-duck, as a rule, nests in the
hollow of a tree, stump or log near, but sometimes
far from, water. Occasionally the black duck will
use a hollow spout adjacent to water, but usually ■
nests on the ground close to it. When brooding,
the mother bird covers her eggs with green or
dead grass before seeking food.
“Jim Carew”: Most wild-ducks build their nests
in trees. When the mother considers her brood old
enough to leave home, she calls up to them from
the ground. The youngsters obey by toppling over
the side of the : nest. As they feel nothing solid
beneath them, they instinctively flap their tiny
wings, thus arresting their descent sufficiently to
allow a safe landing. When the brood is down
safely, the mother leads the way to water.
“Coolabah”: Around the Buddha Lake, near the
Macquarie (N.S.W.), many kinds of ducks congre-
gate, and each variety has a different method of
nesting and of bringing the ducklings to water.
The wood-duck certainly builds in a hollow tree.
Her young ones would not reach the ground alive
if tumbled out of the nest, but the young of ducks
which nest nearer the earth are allowed to fall out.
Young wood-ducks are assisted to earth by both
parents and sometimes are held by the wings. Black
ducks build in the reeds, but I have known them
to settle in stumps or low hollows. Before floods,
ducks rarely build at the water’s edge. They seem
to sense the danger and go on to higher ground.
* * * *
“C.P.”: Has a sheep in full fleece ever
been shorn in two minutes? Which holds the day-
record—-blades or machine ?
* * * *
“Nitric” : A lad of 18 in the Speck, who
was bitten by a black snake while shooting rabbits
the other day, put his finger over the muzzle of
his gun and blew it off. It was a waste of good
flesh and bone if he possessed a knife or a piece
of string. A cut or even a bite at the punctured
spot sufficient to cause bleeding, a ligature at the
base of the finger and one at the -wrist, and the
lad would still be alive and whole, especially as
the Tassie black snake is almost non-venomous, the
red-bellied variety being the dangerous one. Most
deaths alleged to be due to snakebite are, in fact,
attributable to either shock or blood-poisoning re-
sulting from the improper care of the wound.
* * * *
“W.P.T.”: There may be others, but I
know of one attempt to domesticate the dingo. A
friend took the pup in hand when it was only a
week old. It became quite a pet and would run
about the house, play with the children, domesticated
dogs and cats, and even assist in mustering the
sheep. While with the sheepdogs it never attempted
to attack one of the flock, but if left off the chain
at night it was always liable to do damage among
either the sheep or the chickens.
* * * *
“1.L.1.”: Rack from Broken Hill water-
holes are few and far between. The ’Ghans used to
camp at several of these holes between Wilcannia
and the Hill. Their long strings of camels made
the water filthy for days after. To Mohammedans
pig is an unholy animal and accursed. Two porkers
were accordingly sacrificed and their heads so staked
that at some time of the day their shadows must
fall on the water. In each ease the ruse was entirely
successful, the ’Ghana never watering at those places
again, but contenting themselves ,by cursing the
infidels who had defiled Allah’s good water. Niggers
in the Territory use a similar ruse to 'keep animals
away from a favored waterhole, but with only varying
success. Their witch-doctors erect charms on the
banks which are supposed to entirely shut out a
species of monstrous bunyip ; but their success in
excluding alligators is limited.
* * * *
“Outback": The sparrow is as great a
bully as there is in Birdland. He watches the
little fairy martins making their spouted mud nests,
and, when the work is almost finished, drives the
WHILE THERE’S LIFE THERE’S
HOPE.
builders away and takes possession. I have also seen
him annex a swallow’s nest. I watched a pair of
diamond-birds tunnelling the mortar on the side oi
a stone house. When the excavation was completed
the sparrows evicted the smaller birds, which remained
near the nesting site for days, frantically twittering
their protests.

SABBATH DREAMS.
[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
My neighbor swells the straggling stream
Of worshippers with books and beads,
While in the sun I sit and dream
And follow whither Mem'ry leads.
O’er fertile farms and townships fair,
O’er river, plain and scrub-clad hill,
Across the belt of prickly-pear
My- thoughts slip back to Oharlcville.
Last night the mail car’s far-flung lights
Came flashing down the scrub-lined road;
I heard the oft-exchanged “good-nights,”
I saw the canvas-sheeted load.
I saw the shadows of the boys
The station office almost fill :
1 heard the laughter and the noise
That greets the mail from Charleville.
Beneath the sun's fierce mid-day glare
A board splits up with sharp report,
And on the noontide’s scorching air
Come voices from the tennis court.
’Midst shouts and peals of laughter gay,
A ball hops o'er the window-sill—
The Sabbath is a cheerful day
Upon the runs round Charleville.
Beneath the sun’s last crimson rays
A cloud of dust obscures the sight,
And someone at my elbow says
“The mail is right on time to-night.”
An outstretch’d hand —“That all? Good-bye!”
The load of tidings, good and ill.
Is off across the miles that lie
’Twixt station home and Charleville.
My- neighbor goes each Sunday morn
To church; I watch him passing by.
He e.vcs me with a look of scorn;
T read “Apostate!” in his eye.
Yet not in vain the church-bells rain
Their music on the air so still ;
I pray I soon may- see again
The wind-swept plains round Charleville.

“F.R.”: Scooping for river mullet is a
popular sport along the Clarence (N.S.W.). Opera-
tions are carried out on a dark night, a bottle
with a lighted candle and a reflector made of a

MISSED HIS VOCATION.
“Are you goin’ to be a lot of amorphous, gelatinous, protoplasmic,
inrertebrate proletarians?”
“ 'Struth, mate, you oughter go in for the crossword puzzles!”
“Pick” r Many yarns attach to the name
of Murdering Range, between Catheart and Bibben-
luke, on the Southern tableland (N.S.W.). One
fanciful version is that a whole tribe of aboriginal
cattle-spearers was killed there by revengeful pioneer
squatters. Another says that several assigned convicts
who had escaped from Gunningrah station were over-
taken there and shot down by overseers. Still an-
other alleges that the name was given because a
first settler, with his wife and family was slain
there by blacks. The truth is that early Monaro
wool-carriers, plugging their wearisome way through
from Monaro to Twofold Bay, found the steepish pull
and sticky black mud of the region a bit of a killer
for the energy of their teams.
“C.R.C.”: In September, 1922, I was one
of a party of five which left Darwin by lugger for
the Daly River. The attitude of the blacks was
menacing when they first saw us pitching camp, but
after their eyes had rested on our five Winchesters
lying- against a box of
copper-nosed bullets,
they made no further
delay in offering assur-
ances of friendship,
which we accepted
along with their ser-
vices. We carried with
us a portable gramo-
phone and records,
and, wondering what
they would think of
this kind of music, ex-
tended an invitation
to the chief to bring
his tribe along that
evening and listen.
The explanation that
the gramophone was
the white man’s
“dijeree-doo” aroused
curiosity. Shortly be-
fore dusk the tribe
arrived—two or three
hundred in all. Several
dance records were
played, and after the
first or second the
blacks were in a state
of great excitement.
After exhausting our
jazz records we put on
one, little expecting
it to have the effect it
had. The record was
“Home, Sweet Home,”
sung by Adelina Patti.
During the playing
there was neither stir
nor murmur from the
rows of colored figures
in front of us. At the
end of the piece the Chief stood up, walked towards
ns and asked : “What is the matter with her —has
she lost her child ?”
K- * * *
“Coot”: The ants referred to by “Wilga”
(B. 10/9/’25), from whose bodies certain Queensland
abos. concoct a drink, are known in India as
“bamboo” ants. There the natives, instead of com-
pounding a drink out of the bodies, pound them to
a paste, which is used ’as a condiment to be eaten
with curry. To obtain a sufficient number for
the purpose the natives grab a nest —spun of fibre —
in their hands and by squeezing it incapacitate the
inmates. The pounding has to be conducted with
care, otherwise the formic-acid fumes are liable to
injure the eyes.
* * * *
“J.A.” : I recently made the acquaintance
of some black beetles that appear to be closely
related to the sacred Egyptian beetle. My atten-
tion was first drawn to one that was apparently
playing push-ball, for it had a spherical mass at
its rear and was
steadily pushing it
backwards. After a
strenuous journey a
patch of loose sand
was reached, and a
few T minutes’ prospect-
ing led to the selec-
tion of a suitable site.
Then the beetle started
to grub out a hole,
and when the excava-
tion was of the desired
size the ball was
rolled into it and
covered up. I thought
that it contained the
eggs, but such is not
the case, for the beetle
buries itself with its
burden and feeds on it
until the supply is
exhausted. It then
weaves small bags of
the material, into each
of which it lays an
egg. The egg, when
hatched, becomes a
grub and feeds on the
material of the bag.
Later I had an oppor-
tunity of watching
how the ball was
gathered and made up.
The front legs of the
beetle act as feeders,
drawing the material
under the belly, where
it is teased, packed and spun by the hind legs,
finally being revolved until the desired shape is
readied. The accumulation is sometimes the size
of a tennis ball.
“AdeL”: The remnants of a once-powerful
tribe inhabiting the slightly-known ranges in from
the upper reaches of the Gulf of Carpentaria, once
a year come down for their annual eorroboree with
their half-civilised brothers employed on the sur-
rounding stations, and are joined by the salt-water
blacks. These annual festivities generally take place
during the slack season—January to March. Long
before the appointed time small parties begin to
arrive from different parts, and day by day the con-
gregation grows larger. Then the preparations
begin; young station bucks, well mounted on nags,
A WHOLE MENAGERIE.
“Yairs, he went as mad as a rabbit and bucked like a goat, but I
managed to stick on ter the hound.”
“Go hon! 'E must 'ave been a flamin' cow!”
“Too right! He was a fair swine.”
are despatched to settlements for beef, flour, tea and
sugar; the young gins are sent, to white men’s
camps to cadge whatever they can get; the hunters
in small parties go on hunting expeditions; the more
muscular gins, armed with tomahawks, hunt for
goannas and “sugar-bags”; and the oldest members,
with their yam-sticks and palm-fibre baskets,
gather delicious berries and succulent yams. At last
the great day arrives ; sham fights (real ones, too—i
Was in the thick of one once) take place in turn
with each implement of war. At night, the hundreds
of camp-fires look like a city seen at long - distance.
When the banquet is over the jazz begins, the
“pudgeridoo” of the mountain blacks, the rattle of
sticks by the salt-water ones, and the tin-whistles,
jews’-harps and mouth-organs pour forth their weird
music, whilst the gins and old men chant to its
accompaniment, and hundreds of dogs howl and fight.
“Wanchai”: Surely a bag of 4009 hares
is an Australian record for a one-day shoot by a
party! This performance was put up at Omeo (Vic.)
20 years ago when coursing was popular among
mountain sportsmen. The reason for the wholesale
slaughter was twofold. The hares had became so
numerous that they were a pest; also they spoilt
open coursing, the dogs being constantly drawn
from the original quarry to other hares crossing
the track. A “drive” on the Omeo Plains was
therefore organised. A hundred shooters assembled
on the top of a rise, and the hares were then
driven five times, with the result mentioned.
* * * *
"Jesmond”: Norfolk Island pines grow in
the poorest soil (B. 3/'9/’25). About 50 years ago
two were planted in almost solid rock on Phillip
Island (Vic.). The holes for their reception had
to be blasted out of the rock, yet, until they were
killed when the Isle of Wight Hotel was burned
down about six months ago, they were two of the
best specimens in the State. They eompletely
towered over the insignis pines which iine the shore
at Cowes.
* * * *
“Gan”: Not all bnslimen are horsemen.
Tom was a man of 50, getting a bit grey and bald
and he had lived all his life in the Gippsland bush,
Bairnsdale was the biggest town he had ever seen.
He d been all over the surrounding country and
knew it like a book, knew every tree, bird and animal
in its confines. He was a great bushman, yet
always walked wherever he went. He would walk
to a job 40-miles distant rather than take a horse.
His father was just the same, he said. But perhaps
he had a reason for it. “His horse bolted on his
wedding day,” said Tom, with his slow’, gentle,
unemphatie speech. “Perhaps it thought he was a
fool. Then he was caught and robbed by bush-
rangers, the Clarke brothers, who got £4O from him.
He saved a fiver, which was in a side pocket, and
got married that day all the same.” The Clarkes,
by the way, were hanged later on, in ’65 or ’66
But the . family never took to horses after that mis-
adventure.
“Auaf”: A feature of the plagues of mice,
grasshoppers and other pests with which different
parts of Australia are afflicted from time to time is
that, when the visitations are at their zenith, canni-
balism generally breaks out. This occurred during
the recent mouse-plague in the Bendigo district (Vic.)
and was also observed within the last five years
in numerous visitations of the same kind in western
X S. Wales and Bananaland. When first noticed,
it was suggested that it was due to shortage of
food, and that the males only were eating the females
and the weaker members of their own sex. Careful
observation, however, showed that the cannibalistic
impulses were not restricted as stated; the
females were attacking the males as readily as they
themselves were being attacked. Nor was a scarcity
of food the cause, for during one of the western
N. S. Wales outbreaks the mice took to eating
each other in the sheds in which bags of wheat were
stacked. Probably, the explanation is to be found in
some biological law governing the balance of numbers
during the sudden increase in a species’or variety,
and is really a manifestation of the measures that
Nature takes to ensure that the increase will not be
so great and unrestricted as to place a species in
danger of being wiped out.
“Sliamus”: Has any Abo. observer noticed
that the whistling hawk has added to his menu?
In Northern Vic. he has developed a taste for
piglets and become a pest to hog-raisers. His fancy
is for suckers from one to three or four days old.
After that they are free from attack. The robber
has been seen flying from the pen of a sow with
a young pig in his talons. If he starts on a litter
he will, if not checked, take the lot. The number
he is blamed for taking in my district is 11. Prob-
ably many a brood sow has been blamed for eating
her young through the doings of the rascal.
“Fana": Amongst tlie aboriginals of Cen-
tral and Northern Australia the water found in
many small desert “soaks,” especially in those unfit
to drink from, is believed to be capable of curing
skin diseases, ulcers and sores, a belief sjiared by
Many white men. Some soaks are held to possess
qualities far superior to those of others, and to
these journeys are often made over hundreds o:
miles of rough, dry country. While, no
doubt, psychic influence plays a strong part, it is
not at all unlikely that the -water does possess some
of the properties ascribed to it, due to the presence
of chemicals with curative actions. Some substances
employed in medicine for their therapeutic effect
in skin complaints are found in inland Australia,
and it is not at all unlikely that they may be present
in the water of the soaks.
‘"Coola”: In ploughing time it is common
to sec koobaburras watching the freshly-turned sods
for the larva pf cockchafers and other grubs, but
only once have I seen a blue crane following the
furrow. He was a beautiful specimen and beeame
used to the horses and ploughman, so that they could
come fairly close to him. Then two magpies decided
to build a nest close to the ploughing and became
suddenly vicious, and Bluey never returned.
* * * *
“C.M." : Has any Abo.-liar an explanation
to offer of the secret of the fire-walking ceremony of
the people on the Fijian island of Beqa ? A few
months ago there took plaee what is stated to be,
probably, the last exhibition for some years. Shrewd
observers have certified to the genuineness of the
performance, and one—-a medical man—tested its
genuineness by walking over two or three of the
stones with his boots on—and spent several un-
comfortable weeks afterwards. A doctor friend.
speaks of auto-suggestion and hypnotism, and refers
to the Indian mango-tree trick, but the proffered
explanation is too general to be convincing.

SAM’S CONSOLATION.
[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
We didn t ever strike much gold, my ole grey mate
an’ me,
But always was the life we led the best life, which
is free.
We ad our dreams an’ they were good—bright
rainbowed dreams were they—
The dreams that surely seemed to shout: “Cheer up,
there’ll come a day!”
Chaps round about us used to strike the metal good
an’ strong;
in fact, it seemed to Bill an’ me, they never could
go wrong.
But not for us was any find; our luck was counted
out.
Of -that there wasn’t, I can swear, one single clod
of doubt.
We used to nearly starve at times; but Bill ’ad
various ways
Of gettin that four-footed food which sometimes
potward strays.
An we ’ad good potatoes, too, an’ cabbages an’
such—
A lot of useful garden stuff that sometimes counts
for much.
I es, they were ’aid, them olden times gone through
by Bill an’ me,
But ’aid against the ’ardness was the fact that we
were free.
We ’ad no boss to work us like’dull oxen; an’ our
tent,
Or bunk beside a sbelt’ring rock, saved any call
for rent.
An early ev’ry mornin’, when the jacks beg-an to
laugh,
We ad, for our own privilege, a feathered phono-
graph.
Their laughter made the world seem glad an’ it
was good to ’ear;
Tt seemed to banish hopelessness, an’ broodiness
an’ fear.
An’ all the other bushland birds—with or without
much fuss—
As months an’ months passed by, became the greatest
friends with us.
They’d eat the bread we’d throw to them—an’
sodden “damper” that.
In fact, while we grew very thin the feathered
flock grew fat!
Oh no, we never got much gold: but ole Bill Blake
an’ me
At least, as I ave said before, were faet-an’-fancy
free.
An’ even if we missed the prize this solid truth still
stood :
W o found contentment, and the stuff panned cut
about as good !

-Lliere were roses at Randwick last week;
but, as there were races, too, the roses were
mostly born to blush unseen. Do poets fore-
gather with the A.J.C. ? If they do they put
I. egasus out to grass for the day. Even
Dorothea Mackellar when she shoe-horned
her head into her new Spring bonnet would
rather have been vouchsafed a vision of the
day s winners than a ride up Parnassus on
her trusty gee. Anyway, that's what she
looked like. Ina Clift, now, in her service-
able cinnamon tailor-mades and just as ser-
viceable but lighterweight georgettes of mid-
week, might be excused for saying: “Pegasus?
Who trained him, and what's he in for?”
Anyway, that's what she looked like as she
strode with beetling brow about the Ring.

boroniax and "sn a keys’- (that’s. not their
Msted name), and bush-peas- and waxen little
bells smiled'shyly from specimen-jars down
the length of the Education Gallery. The
men of the Naturalists’ Society had lured
the bush maidens to the big city, but they
were kindly villains, after all; their cajoi-
mg had been done in the interests of brick-
bound school kiddies and busli-school kiddies
of long ago now grown into rather dull-eved
business men and women. They were the
ones who loved the show, for it brought
memories of bush tracks and waterholes and
discreet waggings. The Happens!) part of
the attendance liked the Wogs best. They
hung over the tanks in which greeny thing's
sprouted and swimming creatures emulated
Annette Kellerman. Moths, beetles, butter-
flies and locusts, cased and as dead as the
kings ol Egypt, made colorful splashes
about the room.

Ol course the girls all wore the new hone-
tlun silhouette: but though, as is the fashion,
they had their outsides taken off, they had
not their insides taken out: so, anatomically
speaking, there were no skeletons at the feast
of the I ni. Medical Society on Friday night.
Ihe Wentworth was the setting for the
revels, which differed somewhat from the
historic party of Dick Sawbones. Every cell
ol the I'harmacopo'ia hive was emptied of
some o| its occupants. M.D.'s and medical
students, anatomists aiid physicians clinched
with best girls or best boys in the merry
maze,-and anaesthetics and gargles stood on
.table. The Deau of the Faculty of
Medicine brought: Mrs. Mills, who wore color-

Summer has really settled down on Syd-
ney. She made definite entry last Saturday
and the city offered quite a splurge in her
honor. At the Cricket Ground the G.P.S.
flung themselves into every known feat of
strength to her glory. The season was
declared open for the motor Yachts, and
these dashing craft took the waters of Rose
Bay in view of hundreds assembled at the
l etrol Y acht Club House; and rowing clubs
silvered their oars with the waters of Lane
Cove. Races, too, forged ahead at Rand-
wick. bringing out butterfly frocking and a
mouth-watering crop of raspberry-pink hats.
Margaret Bruce, the Sydney soprano who
is now partner of Dinh Gilly in his London
school of singing, has just become engaged

Opera at Covent Garden. Lute Drummond.
AY the way, has also found a niche in the
J finh Gilly school. She is instructor of its
grand opera classes, and in between whiles
contrives to do nearly all Ricordi's Italian
translations.

Mrs. Gilbert Wilson’s popularity brought a wealth
of beautiful flowers and a packed house to the Elite
on the Bth. In a beaded and jetted mariette, the
singer looked handsome as of old, though her voice
< - ararK fl' r d voice of the fifth generation—is
seldom heard nowadays. Lieut.-Governor Bill
Lennon and his wife were in the crowd that listened
while pupils showed their notes. Cecil Hives
especially distinguished herself; and Etta Young was
a runner-up in I'aston Cooper's “Ave Maria.”
Flags have been at hair-mast for James Milne, who
had returned only two days before from a bowling
tour of the Northern Rivers. He died suddenly of
a heart attack. Born in Scotland in 1857, 50 years
ago he joined Smellie and Co. in Brisbane’ and was
chairman of directors of the co. when he died. His
wife, who is a daughter of Kenneth McLennan,
survives him, also five daughters and two sons—
one of the daughters is Lady Orr-Lewis.

The Westinghouse Battery is a
quality product at a competitive
price. It possesses refinements of
detail and design that lift it out of
the general run into a position of
leadership.
The last word in motor-battery production, it ensures
maximum value at minimum price and the ultimate in
satisfaction.
The monoblock acid-proof composition case is the
greatest recent improvement in the construction of
storage batteries. This one-piece Case, fitted with
handles and compartments complete, has done away
with jar and wood case renewals, replacing of handles,
resealing, etc.
The cell divisions in the composition case are double
thick. Thick plates are used which are processed
according to the Westinghouse formula. Only high-
grade selected cedar-wood separators are used. The
simple, strong moulded rubber cover has an important
shock-absorbing feature. The outside appearance of
the battery is both handsome and attractive.
Insure your future investments in batteries by seeing
to it that they bear the name Westinghouse.

MISSES MONN & DOYLE
Phones Cantrel 1532, 1533,
Thursday saw the coming of the new G.-G.
and Lady Stonehaven. But Time has shorn
such events of most of their glitter. Merely
flags waved over Spencer-street station;
’planes to the number of 13 (one came to
grief and then there were 12) hovered over
the city; and a detachment of Light Horse
accompanied the State carriage—outriders
and postillions in livery of royal blue and
gold—to Town Hall, Federal Parliament and
Government House.
Lord Stonehaven, whose first Australian
office was A.D.C. in the household of Sir
Robert Duff, Governor of N. S. Wales 30
years ago, must have felt rather like Dick
Whittington when the Lord Mayor gave him
greeting and the Mayoress in a natural
kasha suit topped by rust-liued millinery
handed her Ex. a posy which streamed rib-
bons innumerable. First view of Lady Stone-
haven suggested that she had swapped toil-
ettes in Adelaide with Lady Forster. A
close-up revealed that her nattier-blue outfit
was an ensemble of crepe georgette, the
coat all fine tuckings and inlets of blue gui-
pure lace; her blue velvet hat had a brilliant
thistle ornament in front and ostrich feathers
at the side. The lady is fair-haired and blue-
eyed, doesn’t look her age whatever it is,
and owns a real complexion. The G.-G.,
dapper, alert, slightly reddish, and also blue
of eye, has no quarrel with Time either.
At the swearing-in the new G.G. pre-
pared to read a message from the King. No-
body rose. A questioning glance and an
accompanying gesture were turned on Prime
Minister Bruce —and the crowd got on its
feet. His Ex. had given his first command.
The ceremony was followed by a tea-drinking
with politicians and consuls and their wives.
At Government House the womenfolk of
the Australian Imperial League of Sailors
and Soldiers and members of the Victorian
Scottish Union and Caledonian Society gave
glad welcome. Representing 13 schools 1500
girls and boys raised their voices in “God
Save,” and the skirl of the pipes came from
the R.C.S. Boys’ Pipe band. The two lassies
of the household. Ariel and Ava Baird, who
were coated alike in golden-brown velvet
with similar hats, showed much interest in
the young folk who were cheering dad so
lustily.
Lord Stonehaven’s staff made a pictur-
esque little group—Flight-Lieutenant A. P.
Davidson in the comic-opera uniform of the
R.A.F.; Captain A. R. W. Curtis in the
trappings of the 11th Hussars; and Captain
W. R. Broadhurst, the Chamberlain, a Gor-
don Highlander. A powerful fine sight the
Chamberlain; over six feet tall and of
gr-r-ahnd build, in kilts, red jacket and
busby, keeping time with a buckled shoe to
the pipes. No wonder official-secretary Star-
ling, awaiting the coming of the G.-G. at
Government House, was moved to take out
his handkerchief and give a parting shine to
some of the jewellery which adorned the
Scotchman’s chest.
Miss Gillett, baptised Alice Margaret,
Lady Stonehaven’s secretary, should know
the ropes. She had four years’ similar ex-
perience with Lord and Lady Jellicoe in
Maoriland.
Bonnie girls in white and boys in their
Sunday best warbled a farewell at Govern-
ment House to Lord and Lady Forster on
the 6th, just before the guns proclaimed their
Exes.’ departure and the Union Jack flut-
tered from the tower to announce the G.-G.
no longer in residence. Melbourne is rather
blase on the subject of leavings and arri-
vals of vice-royalty, so it didn’t hang out
a flag save at Spencer-street, and the proces-
sion through the city in an open carriage with
postillions and a detachment of the Light-
horse was viewed w T ith curiosity rather than
enthusiasm. Lady Forster looked uncom-
monly young and pretty, a study in blue:
she carried a posy of blossoms collected from
Government House gardens and presented
by the head gardener. Navy and army rep-
resentatives. Mayor and Mayoress, and mem-
bers of several yachting clubs gathered at
the station and gave many cheers as the
party set out for Adelaide, where they
greeted the incoming G.-G. and Lady Stone-
haven.
By unanimous vote the City Council last
week made Councillor Brunton its Lord
Mayor for the third year; and if precedent
holds this means another knighthood. The
Mayor and his exceedingly popular wife well
deserve the honor the council has handed
tt? 1 ?’ f or (1 ° their joint job most
efficiently.
F °r < *? i ?, e ' as Da - V at Caulfield on Saturday
one of Melbourne’s dust-distributors led the
weather stakes, with spasms of sun and
shade, so the heavyweight dressing’s only re-
lict was a splash of flower-decked millinery,
with a flimsy frock here and there to break
the monotony of ensemble and tailored suits
««* fur coats. The racing was full of
thrills. I urple Medic was killed and a couple
ot jockeys were injured in a hurdle smash
opposite the vice-regal enclosures; in the
Caulfield Stakes Heroic, Whittier and Fuji
ban were in their worst moods at the bar-
rier; and the Guineas result, with the adored
Manfred glued to the post, brought a gust
of scorn.
The new Federal vice-regals put in an
appearance, the G.-G. being suited in nigger
brown, with a black bowler. Lady Stone-
haven's small velour millinery of vieux rose
had gold quills skidding over the sable collar
of a long black cloth cloak which covered
a frock of floral marocain. State Governor
Stradbroke, who saw his pride just beaten
by Heroic, was there with his lady, whose
black coat was fur-collared and topped by a
black hat cheered with a brilliant ornament.
Daughter Helena’s navy frock with tan col-
lar and cuffs was worn with a hat of shiny
black straws. Hon. Mrs. Pitt Rivers carried
gold flowers upon her panama above an
ensemble of fawn and brown. Mrs. Alan
Currie’s tall slimness was topped by a pic-
ture hat of golden-brown supporting a huge
mauve water-lily; her gown of cinnamon
georgette was worn beneath a wrapping of
beige. Mrs. Ben Chaffey’s fawn suit was
topped by a clierry-red hat. Mrs. Robert
Knox came in champagne-liued coat, with
dabs of deeper toned fur, covering a tan
frock and hat. Mrs. James Purves brought
daughter Valerie, a study in cream. Secre-
tary T. A. Tabart’s wife had flower-decked
black millinery, with a black satin gown;
and Mrs. Merson Cooper in black added a
purple crown.
Lord Stonehaven knows Australia’s casual-
ness about “God Save,” and is taking no
risks. After the Steeplechase a band on the
lawn struck a familiar opening chord; the
G.-G. in a flash stood to attention, hat in
hand. Folks near by arose—and then the
music turned briskly away from the National
Anthem to a fantasia.
Here is Gertrude Johnson, pictured as
Queen of the Night in Mozart’s “Magic
F 1 u t e,” in
which, singing
with the Brit-
ish National
Opera Co. at
Covent Gar-
den, she gained
her most re-
cent success.
During the
past season the
Melbourne so-
prano sang
at 70 concerts
in the British
Isles, and also
didm u c h

While lioli.-'
daying in
Paris a few*
months ago
she renewed
a c q uaintance
with charm-
ing Dolores, wlio had written to her: “I
have followed your career with interest and
rejoice with you and all your friends at
your great artistic success.”
The Alfred Hospital Auxiliary made a
regular gala afternoon of its fourth annual
meeting in the out-patients’ hall. Workers
had reason to rejoice, for their 12 months’
industry had brought in £3350, making the
four years’ record £16,000. Twenty branches
and well over a thousand women now do
their bit for the Alfred. Mr. 11. M. Collins,
the hospital’s president, gave them the de-
served pat of encouragement, and the Auxili-
ary’s chairman, Robert Knox, who presided,
echoed the sentiments. The Boutique, a mini-
ature emporium, shows a present balance of
£2OO and a benefit to the hospital of £7OO
in its short life. After tea and an inspec-
tion of the wards, there was a capital musi-
cal programme. The orchestra of the Insti-
tute for the Blind was heard in bright num-
bers—these blind players are much in de-
mand for dances because of their capital
rhythm.
Melbourne society leans to Sunday after-
noon receptions; so Dr. James Barrett, presi-
dent of the Health Congress which lately
opened here, called its members to a Sabbath
at-home at Palmyra. The hostess was in a
frock ol powder-blue and white' check crepe
de. Chine, with black picture millinery, Truby
•King, Dr. Henrietta Main (she comes from
the University of London to study the Plun-
ket system of mothercraft and child wel-
fare), Dr. and Mrs. Harvey Sutton and
Dr. ,T. S. Purdy (Sydney), versatile Dr.
Ramsay Smith (Adelaide), and Perth’s
Public Health Commissioner (Dr. Everett
Atkinson) were among the visitors.
The Hobart Lyceum Club was atlirob
when the National Council of Women wel-
comed home its president, Mrs. Emily Dob-
son, after her trip to America, where she
represented Australia at the International
Congress at Washington, and where she had
greatness thrust upon her by being made a
life vice-president of the International Coun-
cil of Women. As the venerable lady has
passed her 80th mile-post she has decided to
curtail her globe-trotting in the future.
Jessie Mclntosh’s camera has caught the
features of George Colville, well known
among Mel-
bourne Bohe-
mians of a few
years ago. His
steadily i re-
proving can-
vases are now
catching th e
eye of discern-
ing collectors.
After the w*ar
the Mitchell
Library pur-
chased the ori-
ginals of his

trench paper,
the O Pip.
He is a shy,
elusive artist,
who has hid-
den for some
years on the
working staff
of a Melbourne
daily, and the New Gallery only now houses
his first show of pictures.
“Garden Week” at Wirtins' Olympia was a
show that kept well off the beaten track.
Patrons wandered first in a miniature garden
with grass borders and sandy paths, amid
beds of gay petunias, verbenas, marigolds,
forget-me-nots and such : while rhododendrons
and azaleas glowed against a hedge which
divided this Ormond Plant Farm from other
exhibits. The City Council contributed a
gorgeous array of cinerarias set in a glen
of bush-house foliage; and the daffodils and
their near relations nodded amiably. The
Naturalists lent their aid in a wildflower
collection in which the N. S. Wales waratahs
got away with the honors. It was a fascin-
ating show in which nothing that flowered
seemed missing. Among the implements on
exhibition the most intriguing was a fruit-
grading contrivance—a box arrangement into
which the orchard’s output was tumbled, and
electricity rolled the various sizes into their
different compartments, and man found an-
other job gone. It was all done for the
Cronin Scholarship fund.
This is the Mayor’s month for gathering-
in contributions for his hospital fund. All
other appeals remain more or less dormant
until after Friday, 23rd, when collection-
boxes will rattle around the city and passers-
by will be asked to give gladly—or give, any-
way.
The picturesque eating-rooms of the Aus-
tralian Board of Missions had a morning
tea, given by the National Council and the
Housewives, to fraternise with Mrs.
Moore (“Eve Adam”) and Lady Reed, of
the Imperial Press folk, most of whom went
to Tasmania later in the day. President
Mrs. D. A. Skene, of the N.C.W., bade a glad
welcome to the visitors, who were presently
led to speech. Eve Adam begged the ladies
of Australia to offer the domestic migrants
goodwill instead of criticism; Australia pro-
vided better working conditions and better
food than Great Britain could, and the new
settler only wanted helping over the settling-
down period. Mrs. Glencross, the energetic
head of the Housewives, and Dr. Edith Bar-
rett added to the morning’s crop of interest-
ing remarks.
Victoria’s English-Speaking Union, which
now has a membership of somewhere around
the thousand, has other objects besides the
merely social. A special “common interests”
committee caters for those who seek a better
knowledge of things within our own State.
Under such auspices some hundred will be
made wise as to how matches are made
through an invitation to “lucifers and tea”
at Bryant and May’s factory next Tuesday
afternoon.
Members of the Linen League of St. Vin-
cent’s Hospital did their bit towards the
institution’s big appeal by winning over 400
folk to a dinner-jazz at Scott’s. The popu-
lar rendezvous was as gay as it generally
is on a Melbourne Cup night, with balloons,
and flowers and beautifully-frocked patrons.
Hon. sec. Mary Doyle got through her duties
with honors. President ex-Mayoress Hennessy,
who wore black glistening raiment, brought a
party of friends; and the medical profession
came with its wife and its cousin and its
aunt. Nurses from the hospital offered for
sale the most fascinating of theatre bags
and toilet-table articles, many of them
fashioned by the artistic fingers of Mrs. ,1.
Carrigan.
St. Kilda Town Hall will house some-
thing rather special in parties on the 30tli.
General Monash and brother members of the
Naval and Military Club have bidden the
elect to jazz on that date in honor of State-
Governor Stradbroke.
An effort for St. Vincent’s appeal at His
Majesty’s on the 22nd includes the last lap
of a dancing championship and a turn in
which many of our whitest liigli-lights will
be colored minstrels. Marie de Bavay sec-
retaries the drive.
To-day (Thursday) sees Federal Govern-
ment House given over to pedlars, card-
players, concert artists and jazz. Lady
Stradbroke’s appeal for the Girl Guide move-
ment promises to bear rich financial fruit.
The G.-G. and Lady Stonehaven will join
the merry-makers.
The Stork, flying over Tasmania, left a
parcel containing a wee girl with the C. T.
Butlers the other day. The parents are the
amateur Royal Tennis crack and Iveva Allar-
d.yce that was, youngest daughter of the
Speck’s late Governor. The marriage took
place from Federal Government House, the
then G.-G. handing the bride over.
Melbourne Hospital has sent out the fiery
cross to hen owners, and mentioned its need
of 160,000 eggs per annum. Last year the
appeal brought in 80,000 eggs, so that the
matron was able to put a large quantity
into store against the time when the fruit
became dear, and this year the appeal is for
an effort to beat that record. It would be a
shame to throw any but bad bad eggs at poli-
ticians when such a good cause is waiting to
receive the sound ones.
This Chatterer the other day gave credit
for too much to Roma Field, of Temora.
Her exhibit at the Show was superfine; but
the first-prize crochet cloth of linen thread
was the work of Helga B. Sudholz, of Rip-
ponlea (Vic.).
Sunday Baillieu, daughter of the Arthur
Baillieus, is the latest society maiden to
grow weary of frivolling. She has a flair for
frock-designing, and is turning her talents
to thinking out confections for Aveille et Cie.
Wedding bells rang on September 24 at St.
Pat.’s for Nell Farrar, of Rose Bay, Sydney,
and Gus Lawler, also formerly of the harbor
city, now of the Bulletin staff in Mel-
bourne. The bride is well known around
the Cowra district, her folk owning Broula’s
broad acres.
Sister Adelaide’s P.'S.:—
For the second time D’Auvergne Boxall lias won
the Melrose prize for portraiture at the Society of
Arts Exhibition, and he has taken the society’s own
landscape prize, too. lie backs his natural gifts for
line and color with untiring industry and is spurred
by a delightful modesty that tells him he has still a
lot to learn. Mr. Melrose declared the exhibition
open—one of the best the society has had—and was
thanked by Boxall not only for his prize, but for an
example that stimulated the society to do likewise for
land- and seascapes.
There will be mourning in many homes for Dr.
J. A. G. Hamilton. One of his cherished schemes was
for a women’s hospital (his own experience at the
Adelaide had shown him the bitter need for it), and
he lived to hear the present Government pledge itself
to build one.
G. A. Conner, who had put in most of his 65 years
here with the Bank of Adelaide, has gone on the long
journey. His widow is one of the Simpsons of
Ridge Park.
Community singers made their final effort for this
year at a special evening session whereat Wallace
Packer and Alfred Vardori were alternately conductors
and there was barely a vacant seat in the Town Hall.
The State Orchestra has packed away its instruments,
too, after a programme that beat its own records,
and wherein Maude Puddy’s part at the piano in
Mozart’s E-Flat Concerto won her a garden of flowers.
This State feels that it has a sort of proprietary
interest in the Stonehavens, and the Town Hall was
crammed for the civic reception as they passed
through. Speeches and addresses of welcome and a
word or two with Boy Scouts and Girl Guides didn't
leave much time on their hands, but her Excellency
made a dash, per motor, for Marble 'Hill, where “so
many happy days were spent,” and she explored
Government House inside asnd out to see what were
the changes there. They and the Forsters (who have
been the Barr Smiths’ guests at Birksgate and have
had a restful time) lunched with the Pooles at the
Queen Adelaide Club, and afterwards her Excellency
had a word with some she remembered from her
school-girl days when her ftither was Governor here.
For once we’ve had a race day that didn’t threaten
or demonstrate a blizzard, and woman left her
winter wrappings at home and emerged in sleek
satins and filmy georgettes. True, they were sober-
hued, thanks to the prevailing passion for black,
but there was an occasional oolor riot in headgear and
there were splashes of blue and green and yellow in
the more flapperish dresses. The official luncheon and
tea were hostessed by Mrs. H. D. Young.
Adelaide University, though it will celebrate its
jubilee next year, has worried along so far without
a “common seal” or coat of arms. However, Chan-
cellor Murray, being in Engl ami at present, has made
the proper application and pair! the big fees required
by the Hereditary Marsl*il of England and such
people, and acquired the proper “patent of arms.”
The device chosen is simple, an open book on a
shield, with the five stars of the Southern Cross above
it, and the motto “Beneath the cross, light”—in
Latin, of course.

Anderson, Charlton, Collins and his merry men and other
Australian Sportsmen have done more to make Australia known
amongst the world of nations to-day than her official representatives
have ever done. It goes to show the great part Sport plays in the
national life of every country.
It has been said that we Australians are too fond of Sport. Surely
a foolish statement —coming as it apparently does from one who has
not known the love of the open spaces —the wonderful advantages
Australia provides for any Sport.
It naturally follows that Australia should have “The World’s
Greatest Sports Store” to serve the needs of her great Sporting
Public —a store built upon many years of honest service, selling
every article at the lowest possible price.

NOTIONS
A horse like Windbag is a better financial
proposition these days than any Australian gold-mine.
During the A..T.C. Spring meeting, Windbag earned
£5851 for Robert Miller —£1830 in the Spring
Stakes, £2209 in the Craven Plate and £1812 in the
Rand wick Plate. The gallant bay’s victims in the
Craven Plate were Pilliewinkie, Pantheon, The Hawk
and Polycletan, and although the ten furlongs were
traversed in fast time (2min. 44sec.), he could have
reduced it by seconds had he been pushed; and he
defeated Pilliewinkie, Frances Tressady and Valamita
(a good horse spoilt for this season by over-racing
and execrable placing) with equal ease in the two-
mile Randwick Plate. He is not much to look at,
and he has a whimsical habit of loafing when he has
his field settled (he did this in the Randwick Plate,
but got up top speed in a few strides when Pillie-
winkie came again) ; moreover, he hasn’t been boomed
so industriously as Heroic or Manfred. All the same,
there will be a ton of Sydney money to say that the
son of Magpie—Charleville will beat both the Valais
horses at Flemington, whatever the distance and the
conditions.
Windbag is trained for Robert Miller (brother of
Percy Miller, the breeder), by G. Price, whose Rand-
wick stable also shelters Baldwin, who won the Gran-
tham Stakes and the Suburban Handicap for D. U.
Seaton. Kanooka, whose success in the Gimcrack
Stakes added £2204 to R. Miller’s cheque—£9883
-10s. altogether—is prepared by W. Kelso, who also
saddled up Boaster, the Epsom dead-heater, Bairn,
winner of the Shorts, and Red Gauntlet, victorious in
the Kensington . Handicap with lOst. 101b. and the
Chester Handicap with lOst. 111b.—in the latter
race he ran the six furlongs in lmin. 12) sec. In his
own company. Red Gauntlet proved himself the best
welter horse Sydney has seen for many a day. Vet
Windbag, conceding 211b., beat him in a canter in the
six furlongs New Mexico Stakes at Randwick on
July 25; and six furlongs is not Windbag’s distance,
though he is good at them all. Munro rode Windbag,
Boaster and Kanooka, and tote punters who followed
him had a good meeting, for his 20 mounts realised
[>) wins, two seconds and a dead-heat for third. He
is a very good jockey who is at his best when the
whips are cracking, but, like all good jockeys, he
rides a bad race occasionally. One of his inferior
efforts was on Pigeon Pie in the last race at
Canterbury Park on September 30, The same Pigeon
Pie is a pretty good horse, and should win a decent
handicap presently.
A blot, on an otherwise enjoyable and well-
controlled meeting was the Dowling Steeplechase, in
which three of the six starters came down and two
—Sandridge and Yandarlo—were killed, the jockeys
escaping with shock, bruises and (in one case) a
broken arm. Ninety-five p.c. of the A.J.C.’s patrons
would be relieved if steeplechases were abolished for
all time. The totalisators handled £274,911 10s., as
compared with £306,513 5s. at the corresponding
meeting last year. One explanation of the drop is
that there Is not so much money about as there
was, thanks to the strike gentry; another is that a
tote which pays only 60 p.c., 20 p.c. and 20 p.c. (or
75 p.c. and 25 p.c. when fields are small) out of a
pool from which 13.7 p.c. is deducted is losing its
attractions to the small punter. The Government
takes '9 pic., the club’s commission is 34 p.c. and
unclaimed dividends and fractions of sixpences make
up the 13.7 p.c., the average deduction last year. It
is far too much. A 74 p.c. deduction, the Government
taking 4 p.c. and the club 34 p.c. without unclaimed
dividends or fractions, would "be ample. Also, instead
of the 60-20-20 or 75-25 p.c. arrangement there
should be straight-out and place (equal-division)
.machiigs. as in Westralia. Because the tote punter
is not getting a fair spin, an increasingly large portion
of the money wagered on horse-racing flows into the
starting-price shops. And that is no good to the
the Government or the country.
Manfred was seen in another sensational
act at Caulfield on Saturday, but this time there were
curses instead of cheers. On appearance as well as
form the A.J.C. Derby winner stood out from the
six other starters for the Guineas, and he was 3 to X
on with most of the books, a few heroes offering
to take 5 to 2. Petunia was at 7’s and Manacre
B’s, with Ambassador and Redshank at 2Q’s. It took
a lot of trouble to get Manfred to face the machine,
and when the barrier went up he refused to move.
All Duncan’s efforts to induce him to pursue the
field were fruitless. Redshank and Petunia did
the early leading, but at the turn Ambassador shot
through on the rails and looked like winning easily.
Manacre, however, finished very gamely and just got
by half a head, with Petunia third; Forbes,
Who is by no means a fashionable jockey, rode the
winner most vigorously at the crisis. Manacre,
who is by Amanus—Berylacre, is owned by “F. H.
Cljcle” and trained by R. Cameron. He ran the mile
in lmin. 41-Iscc.
W.-f.-a. form has been very puzzling in
Melbourne this season, and the Caulfield Stakes added
to the general mystification. Heroic, who had been
donkey-licked by Fuji San in the October Stakes at
Flemington the previous Saturday, was always favorite
at 7 to 4, with Whittier 9 to 4, Fuji San 6’s and The
Night Patrol 20’s. Again there was bad behavior
at the post, Heroic, Bolet Satan and even Whittier
figuring in it. Kellow’s chestnut was eventually
placed in No. 1 position—he had drawn No. 3—the
clerk of the course led him to the machine, and at
the word “go” he jumped out clear of his field.
Harrison steadied him, however, and The Night
Patrol took the lead from Mercian King, Fuji San
and Heroic. The English horse galloped into the
straight two lengths in front of Heroic, and hung
on much better than usual, but Heroic finished too
strongly and won by a neck from the vice-regal nag,
who was the same distance in front of AVhittier, with
Fuji San and Mercian King next, and Bolet Satan in
his usual position—last. AVhittier was unfortunate
at the start, and met with trouble during the race ;
in the circumstances he did well to run a close third,
especially as he was conceding the winner 41b. In
the Caulfield Cup Heroic will have to give him 41b.
In the Debutant Stakes Jim Scobie Started two
youngsters, Trey lon and Cyden. The latter, a nice
filly by Cyklon—Deneb, was supposed to be better
than the colt, who had run second in a division
of the Maribyrnong Trial Stakes, and Cyden was
always favorite at 3 to 1, with Donace 7 to 2 and
Trey lon 7 io 1. Treylon, however, proved the best
bet; strongly ridden by Bob Lewis, he won by a
head from Duchess of Blankney (Blankney ll.—Melton
Duchess) with the favorite, who came from a long
way behind, third. Treylon, who ran the four
furlongs in 50jscc., is by Cyklon—Trey and is
owned by Ernest Clarke.
MISUNDERSTOOD.
WELL-MEANING LUNATIC: “AS a golfer, sir, you will he
able to tell me why those men abused me just now.”
GOLFER; “ What happened?”
W.M.L.: “When they hit their hall over here I politely
picked it up and threw it back.”
The betting on the Toorak Handicap was 7 to 2
Brimming, 4’s Ivaiwarra, 6’s Sailing Home, 7’s
Metellus and 10’s Pale Light, with 12’s to 20’s the
others. Ivaiwarra jumped out in front, and tried to
stay there; but Metellus, who had always been
prominent, cut him down at the entrance to the
straight, and, sustaining a long run with fine courage,
won by a neck from Palelight. who finished well,
With Textile a good third ; Ivaiwarra, Jimmie B. and
Sailing Home were close up. Metellus, who com-
pleted a nice double for Kellow and Holt, was ridden
by Duncan, and, with his 101 b. penalty for dead-
heating in the Epsom, carried 9st. lib. ; he will
have Bst. 131 b. in the Caulfield Cup. He ran the
mile in lmin. 40sec.
Twenty-four horses have been left- in the Caul-
field Cup. Heroic (9st. 41b.) and Whittier (9st.) are
the popular picks, but Royal Charter (Bst. 31b.),
Our Prince (7st. 121 b.), Honan (7st. 41b.), Spear-
felt (9st. 21b.), Batteryman (Bst. lib.), King of
Mirth (Bst. 31b.), Tookarby (7st. 71b.), All Sunshine
(Bst. 111 b.) and Metellus all have admirers in that
order. The subsequent victories of Baldwin, Red
Gauntlet, Metellus and Bard of Avon show that
Epsom form was unusually good, and Honan is not
to be discarded for his failure to win that race with
Bst. This page selects Honan to win, with Whittier
and Our Prince next best.
Eurythmic was fated not to enjoy his
retirement long; he died last week at Dunreatli, a
stud farm in the neighborhood of the W.A.T.O.
racecourse, established bv P. A. Connolly, owner of
Feathernest. By Eudorus —Bob Cherry, the chestnut
won £36,891 in stakes for the Westralian pastoralist
Ernest Lee Steere, who bought him at the Sydney
yearling sales in June, 1918. There was good Carbine
blood in the youngster on the dam’s side, and he
would have brought a lot more than the 310 guineas
at which he was knocked down to Lee Steere if it
hadn’t been for a swinging leg. Eurythmic’s turf
career was lucky to the extent that Artilleryman
and Richmond Main, his great contemporaries, were
out of action when he came over from Westralia in
1920—Artilleryman had died and Richmond Main had
lost his form. Also, the w.f.a. race in which he beat
Poitrel at Flemington (it was the only time they
met at w.f.a.) resolved itself into a six-furlong
sprint, and Poitrel was no sprinter. However,
Eurythmic proved himself a great horse when he
won the Sydney Cup as a four-year-old with 9st. 81b.
on his back, after looking hopelessly out of it half
a mile from home; and he was travelling like a
winner, with lOst. slb. up, in Sister Olive’s Melbourne
Cup, when he cannoned against another horse and
limped in on three legs. After that race a Sydney
surgeon with sporting proclivities said he would never
be the same horse again; and this was demonstrated
when he met Beauford in the A.J.C. Autumn Stakes—
indeed, his early death may be traceable to that
heroic attempt to rival Carbine’s achievement in
the Melbourne Cup. In all Eurythmic won
races (including the Caulfield and Perth Cups), ran
six seconds and four thirds, and was only six times
unplaced. A record* which has rarely been excelled.
Unlike most of gt. Anton’s progeny,
Ethelton, who is by St. Anton—Ethel Maude, has
shown a liking for the Derby distance. In the
S. Aus. Derby at Morphettville, the bay filly made
harks of the second favorite All Crimson (Bardolph
-Wandora) and 10 others, w'inning by eight or
ten lengths in 2min. 86]sec. Ethelton is owned
and trained by J. M. Cummings, who intends taking
her to Melbourne for the V.R.C. Oaks.
* * * *
There was a great smashing of bike-riding
records in Victoria on Saturday. Over the first
100 miles of the Warrnambool-Melbourne road race,
J. Beasley, one of the scratch men, registered
4hr. IBmin. 3see., beating the previous best figures
in the book by 6 2-ssec. In
the Colac-Melbourne event for
amateurs, Allan Quinton
covered 100 miles in 4hr.
llmin 47sec., cutting the
amateur record by 40min.
55sec. as well as knocking
6min. 16sec. off Beasley’s time.
And A. F. Quinton was only a
fraction of a second behind his
brother. The Warrnambool
affair went to Esmond William-
son, of Footscray. who had an
hour’s start from the scratch
men. Williamson passed the
further limit men after travel-
ling 95 miles, and, plugging
away hard by himself over
the remaining 70 miles, finished
eight minutes before the second
man, O. Colvin (52min.), who
was a wheel or so ahead of W.
A. King, his mark-mate. A
finishing sprint for fastest-time
honors between the scratch men
saw Jack Beasley lift his
machine ahead 100 yards from
home, but the young West-
ralian, Harold Smith, hung to
him. and. jumping forward in
the last few yards, won by a
margin which was officially re-
corded as a tyre. Smith’s time
for the 165 miles was 7hr.
25min. lsec. The amateur
handicap was won by O. A.
Pettman (10m in.) from his
Coburg-club colleague W. Mc-
Laughlin (22min.), with A.
Prietor, of South Yarra
(41min.). third. Pettman’s rid-
ing time was 4hr. 21min.
36sec.
“Roadster”; There were 174
starters in the Warrnambool-
Melbourne race and 165 lilv-
whites set out from Oolae.
The latter struck several miles
of bad road, a fact which en-
hances the merit of A. L.
Quinton’s performance and
that of his brother —they be-
long to Richmond, by the way.
There is talk of the amateurs
racing from Warrnambool to
Melbourne next year. The
pros.’ race, which was inaugu-
rated in 1895 by the Dunlop
Rubber Co., is regarded as the greatest road handicap-
race in the world.
“Simon”'f Talking of daylight robberies
(B. 24/9/’25), the smartest thing I remember was
worked on a starting-price bookmaker operating in
a shop about two miles from Victoria Park, Sydney.
While Mcßook wasn’t looking one of the usual
loungers about the shop whipped the hands of the
alarm-dock back 15 minutes. The particular race
started at 2.30 p.m. Immediately it was over a man
on the racecourse fence waved a clothes prop, on
which was a white handkerchief, three times. An-
other with a ’phone at hand read the news from the
next eminence and passed it on. Presently still an-
other idler wandered into the s.-p. place and invited
a cobber to have a cigarette, offering him a box with
three in it. Thereupon the other said: “Slowed if
I don’t have a fiver on Loop the Loop—three’s me
lucky number.” Loop the Loop started at sevens, and
Mcßook gloomily paid over £35. lie smelt a rat
but couldn’t exactly identify it. Strange as it may
seem, he decided there and then to get out of the
game, and, starting- a totally different line of business,
he was soon making a good living within the law.
“Ascot”: The punter had been backing
also-rans all day, so he listened hopefully when an
urger came up with the usual tale of “a stone
certainty in the next; you can empty out on it.”
“All right,” said the punter. “I’ll take a chance.
What is it?” “I know’ what’s wrong with you,”
snarled the urger. “You’re too blanky inquisitive.”
The Melbourne football season finished
in a blaze of glory and cheers and general satisfac-
tion. Queues formed outside the Melbourne G. G.
gates live hours before the game started. Down at
Geelong shops and factories closed at 11 a.m., and
the populace stormed the railway station, swept
away barriers and squeezed itself into a fleet of
special trains, so intent was it on seeing its ’bailers
win the premiership. Ultimately the crowd totalled
64,288 —a Melbourne record- —and the “gate” £3132
7s. 9d. The game was fast, keen and vigorous, with
the men from Sleepy Hollow marking better, showing
superior system forward and handling the ball more
cleanly. Beginning the last quarter 25 points to
the bad, the Magpies made a determined effort to get
on top, but the solid Geelong defenders kept them
off. They had got within 10 points when the bell
ended everything: Geelong, 10 goals 19 beliinds;
Collingwood, 9 goals 15 behinds. It is the first
premiership Geelong has won since the League was
formed in 1897, and the village spent Sunday keep-
ing its head in ice.
“Winkle”: Geelong’s win was a personal triumph
for its captain, Cliff Rankin. When the Collingwood
system flashed out he checked it by momentarily
crowding the play, and at the right instant worked
his own combination with speed and certainty. His
usual goal-getter, Hagger, was employed to decoy the
Collingwood defenders up a lane while Rankin himself
took the passes; the captain kicked five goals. Cliff
was custodian with the all-victorious A.I.F. Rugby
team, and turned down many offers to play that game
in Sydney and Brisbane. His talent for football is
inherited. His dad, Ted Rankin, was among the
best rovers of his day ; and his brother Bert ranked
as the greatest centre of his time.
* * * *
Broken Hill brightened the dying foot-
ball season immensely by introducing into it
the strike principle. South B. H. club condemned
all the Association’s boundary umpires, and peti-
tioned for a fresh lot. Being denied this, it refused
to play again under them, and drove its opponents
frantic by just staying away from one match after
another. At last an independent appeal-committee
of three sat on the case. They took their time over
it, and there was one hectic moment when a strike
against them, on the ground of their delay, seemed
likely. Then they said South had behaved “most
improperly and unconstitutionally, peremptorily and
autocratically”; the club was fined £5O, and its
players forbidden any touring trip, either this season
or next. The judges, however, implied that South
had grounds for its original complaint. They recom-
mended that no member of a club shall be eligible as
an umpire, and that every intending official shall
have his sight tested. Finally they decided that three
of the present boundary umpires and one goal umpire
“are by temperament unsuitable to act in senior
football, and their appointments are accordingly
cancelled.” After which, it need hardly be said,
the umpires went on strike.
* * * *
Several school records were broken at
the annual G.P.S. sports on the Sydney Cricket
Ground, and critics formed a very favorable opinion
of J. Carlton (St. Joseph’s), who is only 16. Com-
peting among the senior boys, Carlton won the
100yds.: (lOlsec.), the 220 (23sec.) and the 440
(51 l-ssee. ; the last-mentioned effort clipped 1 2-ssec.
off the figures of E. R. Cox (1911) and “Slip”
Carr (1917). There is the promise of future
greatness in this well-built youngster if he is not
allowed to overdo it while he is growing. M, 11.
Rylance (King’s) was second to Carlton in each
event; tliexr he won the 120yds hurdles in 16 4-ssee.
The distance champions are C. S. Stuart (C.E.G.S.),
who established new’ figures for the half-mile (Tmin.
59 3-ssee.), and N. Iv. Lamport (King’s), who left
the mile behind in 4min. 41 2-ssec. In the under-
-16 division S. M. Wansey (King’s) made a good
impression by running half a mile in 2min. 9 3-ssec.
(2 l-ssec. off Stuart’s time in 1922) ; and in the
under-14’s J. 11. Byrnes won the 100yds. (11 3-ssec.)
and the 220 (25 4-ssec.). For the senior school
title King’s , (49 points) had an easy win over
“Shore” (39) and St. Joseph’s (38) ; and Newington
(,334 points) led the other eight schools for the
junior title.

Englishman Danny Frush was unable to
keep his engagement with Adriano at the Sydney
Stadium, so. another Englishman in Jack Joseph got
the date and 25 p.c. of the best “house” he has
boxed before in all the four years since he u’as first
imported. lie had beaten Harry Casey (Q.) on points
on the previous Monday night, but his weight in-
creased to lOst. 41b. in the subsequent relaxation:
whereas the Filipino was trained to the minute at
9st, 81b. The brown man has no forehead to speak
of, but the grey matter is evidently in good work-
ing order, and though the Briton staggered him
twice and belabored him with bunches of rights
while holding with the left, Adriano scarcely’ ever
missed an opening for a tremendous w’allop. He
dropped Joseph three seconds before the bell in
the second round, and the sixth w’as not half a
minute old when a fiery right uppercut landed on the
w’hite man’s point and knocked him out. For a
stopgap affair it was quite exciting, and Joseph
deserves another chance.
Melbourne Stadium dished up 65 rounds
of stoush on Saturday, and some of it was worth
seeing, notably the go between Mickey Walker, of
Sydney', and the local lad, Evans. Michael secured
the verdict after 12 sultry rounds had so far put
the loser out on his feet that he seemed to have lost
all interest in the proceedings. The principal bout
w’as a meeting of Jamito, the shop-worn Filipino,
and Joe Cameron, a clever hard-hitting welterweight:
Jamito, lOst. 41b. ; Cameron, lOst. 71b. Cameron hit
straight and cleanly with both hands, but the
Filipino ducked and hung on assiduously. The
verdict for Cameron found favor everywhere except
in the MaTnilaman’s corner.
TH E BIG THREE
[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
“Tell me, my son, who would you. rather be
Of all this land’s illustrious citizenry?”
I asked a bright-eyed boy on Manly quay.
“Is Stanley Bruce your ideal,” I pursued,
“Of one who treads a path with flowers bestrewed
And roosts upon the dizziest altitude?
“Or, say, has Charlton touched your fancy more?
Or stolid Lang or massive Theodore?
Or is it Edgeworth David you adore?
“Or has some soldier cast on you his spell,
Monash or Ryrie, that imposing swell,
And made you deem him super-enviable?
“Poets and painters we have too, forsooth,
Whose art or verse may fire the blood of youth
And make you worship them in sober truth.
“Then there are squatter kings, commercial caps,
Whose weight and wealth impress us humble chaps,
Places you'd change with one of these, perhaps.”
“I’d be,” his voice came positive and shrill,
“Collins or Ryder, if l had my will.
Sec what a pull they’ve got on Clement Hill.
“Who can compare with them in power and fame,
The chosen three the cricket team that frame
To give old England slops at England’s game,
“To thrill the crowds and gather in the pelf?
And though ’tis true that one is on the shelf
Each of the other two can pick hirrtself.”

THE INKY WAY.
M. G. Mascord, 'who used to be chief machinist
for the Age (Melb.) but returned to London to be-
come works manager for the Daily Chronicle, has
been summoned to the “chapel” in Shadowland. He
loft many friends on the Syme concerns.
F. B. Riley, a Westralian Rhodes Scholar —he is
a son of the Archbishop of Perth —is these days
in the London Times office in New York. He spent
five years in Iraq and other years in other foreign
parts, and now is busy studying American conditions.
Two Bulletin contributors helped to get the latest
Adelaide University Magazine ready for the printer
—editor 1). P. Maguire, whose verse has many
admirers (incidentally, he was one of the leaders of
the Adelaide team against the Oxford debaters), and
a former editor whose pen-name is “Flicker.”
While flattered at receiving so much attention, the
overseas members of the Press Conference who run
big papers in the Cold Land were frankly puzzled at
the sense of proportion that allotted as much as ten
columns a day to their doings. Still, if the public
was bored for a few days the pressure kept out a
vast quantity of other rubbish.
The Vic. Farmers’ daily sheet, the Morning Post, is
due on Oetooer 29, just in time to have a word
from Cocky’s point of view on the Federal elections.
It is starting off with a juvenile executive staff.
Tom Fitzgerald, the editor, is just over 30; Jack
Bellevv, news editor, is 24; the chief sub-editor is
Harry Grover, bright son of Monty, who is a few
years short of 30.
“6. Ren”: “II.Iv.” (B. 17/9/’25) describes the
58-year-old Sydney Evening News as the first
evening paper in Australia. On April 10, 1857, the
Adelaide Times, which had previously been a morn-
ing issue, began to appear in the evenings, the change
resulting, according to the editor, in “a most
pleasing improvement in the circulation.” For
all that, it passed out in the ’sixties.
“Trinity”: Amongst the most enterprising of Mel-
bourne ’Varsity women students is Joan Mary Fin-
lason, of Janet Clarke Hall, who has been social
editress of the students’ weekly paper. Next year the
journal (it was christened Farrago) is to be run
as a semi-news, semi-literary publication on more
ambitious lines, and the young lady from Trinity has
been selected to guide its destinies. She will be
doing history finals next March.
“0.P.H.” : Alec Peacock grinned in the Vic. Assembly
the other morning when he saw the surprise depicted
on the faces of new members as Chief Sec. Argyle
moved that strangers be excluded. It was 3 o’clock
(a.m.), and the novices couldn’t detect any in-
truders ; but it was soon borne in on them that
reporters, official and unofficial, were referred to. In
pre-Federation days exclusion of pressmen at long
sittings was common enough—-in fact, the reporters
used to prompt Davie Gaunson to get them a spell.
More than once they were directed to pitch into
him on the following day for shutting out the light.
But Davie understood all that.
“Alwyn”; Touching on that Inky Way reference to
Footscray’s (Vic.) remembrance of the third anni-
versary' of the death of Henry Lawson and incidental
lament that Abbotsford (N.S.W.), where the poet
breathed his last, overlooked the event (B. 24/9/’25),
the indictment against the latter place cannot be
sustained. The last monthly meeting of the Abbots-
ford District Association took the form of a FLawbon
Evening.” They not only had several readings from
Lawson, but W. Jago, editor of Aussie, gave an
interesting sketch of the poet’s career. Incidentally,
it is the intention of the Association to suitably
mark the spot where Lawson died.
After running for nearly 70 years Kyneton (Vic.)
Observer has stopped, and the remains have been
acquired by the local Guardian. Up to the time
of his death in 1887 G. J. Sands had a long tenure
as proprietor of what was then a tri-weekly. He
was in the Assembly from 1564 to 1867, and he beat
John Gavan Duffy (for Dalhousie) in 1886. After
him Sam Johns, Pat Cleary, Tom Shorthill, Kerr and
Jennings (the last-named a lessee) tackled the paper
in succession. Jim Hankinson was on the paper for
40 years as foreman printer, reporter and sub-
manager. He saw the end approaching three years
ago or thereabouts, and flitted to a less precarious
job in Melbourne.
The Westralian Worker- will have to depend on
substitutes for the next couple of months, for Jack
Curtin, the editor, is standing for Fremantle, and
Andy Clementson, who runs the advertising depart-
ment, is after a Senate seat. In 1919 Curtin nearly
killed himself by editing his paper and opposing J.
M Fowler for Perth at the same time, but Groper-
land Labor is not likely to let the devoted young man
repeat the folly. It will be Curtin’s third Federal
contest and Clemenson’s also —the former opposed
W. A. Watt for Balaclava in 1914, and the latter
bounded into the ring at Fremantle in 1919 and at
Perth three years later. Both are interesting speakers
and excellent fellows, with the gift of attracting
people w’ho detest their politics.
“Rounds”: Without the co-operation or goodwill
of those who made the arrangements for the Imperial
Press Conference’s visit to Melbourne, the Vic. District
of the A.J.A. managed to get Lord Burnham to its
den in Empire Buildings. Claiming to be a
working journalist himself, the big man of the Con-
ference showed himself quite at home among fellow
members of the craft and didn’t forget to mention
that he was alone as a one-man owner of a big
London daily (the Telegraph). He pleased the
paper-stainers by telling them it was his considered
view that they, as a section of newspaperdom, had
never got their fair share of the profits ; some other
sections, he hinted, had for a long time drawn their
full share or more. To muster 120 scribes at 6.30 in
the afternoon was an achievement Lord Burnham
was not slow to appreciate, and he probably found
three-quarters of an hour he spent with them more
congenial than some of the long stretches he put in
with more important people.
“Hargo”: Met recently in a Western N.S.W. town
Jack Farrell, one of a few who are left of the old
band of itinerant compositors. The lino, sounded
the death-knell of the “tramp” in newspaperdom over
a quarter of a century ago, but what a godsend he
was to the country newspaper in the old hand-setting
days! He knew when show-time fell in the various
centres, with schedules and catalogues to keep the
printer busy; municipal and Parliamentary elections,
half-yearly meetings of mining companies and the
like were signals for him to bob up. Over 40
years ago there were three of them on the Victorian
roads at the same time, who answered to the names
of Crowe, Sparrow and Hawk ; “King” Cole and his
dog were known in practically every comp.-room;
others of the fraternity were Jim Pitt, Tommie
Pritchard, Charlie Stoy and Munro the bookbinder.
All were good tradesmen, to whom the rules of
type-setting were almost a religion. The machine
eats the copy and has revolutionised the trade; but
its output lacks the finish which the hand-comp,
put to his work.
“D.D.”: “Two. Seas” (B. 10/9/’25) is wrong—the
Lady was not the first women’s paper in N. S. Wales
(that ihonor belongs to the Dawn, run for some years
by Henry Lawson’s mother), neither was the late
Van Weenen the founder of the Lady. The founder
was Horold Tilley, who had just left the Namoi
Independent, of Gunnedah. He put the proposition
to me and the late Ernest Favene ; we agreed that it
would be good if we could get money into it. Tilley
mentioned two pals of jiis with money and a fancy
for journalism—Van Weenen and A. Chapman, a
former official assignee. They agreed to come in. I put
£lOB in as my contribution, and the other two said
Tilley could draw on them when that amount was
exhausted. Tilley came in for nix as vendor of the
idea. When time for drawing came, Van told us
he had been offered £l2OO for his stamps, but was
holding out for £l5OO. So he couldn’t pay. Chap-
man said his estate was in the name of his wife, and
she refused to "hand out. “Two Seas” says that the
Lady’s career was chequered. The printer thought it
was far too unchequered; I was the only one who
chequed.

“The Bad Man,” which made its first
Sydney appearance at the Royal on Satur-
day, is dinkum melodrammer in a Wild-
West setting. There’s an upstanding young
ranch-owner in love with the really bail
man's wife; his amazing uncle, who whirls
through and around every situation in his
invalid chair; a mortgage on the home; a
grasping moneylender waiting to foreclose; a
wicked financier coveting the property for
himself because he believes there's an oil
gusher seething behind the barn or the wood-
pile. The story opens on a mid-summer
afternoon in the living-room of Eric Maxon’s
ranch, which is divided from Mexico by a
mere hedge of cactus and a thin line of cattle.
The mortgagee is to foreclose at 8 p.m., and
meantime the cook (Cyril Wendcr) has
looked on the wine and forgotten to burn the
dinner. Into the domestic scene jazzes Uncle
Leslie Victor in his chair, petulantly craving
food. The same homing instinct brings
Ailsa Grahame and her diabolic husband
Gerald Pring and honest-cowboy Joseph
Cunningham back to the family nest. With
admirable forethought Winnington Barnes
has ridden over to be on the spot to fore-
close on the stroke of eight, and after him
comes Angela Hardy, his flapper daughter,
who thinks she’s in love with the manly
young ranch-owner. Then, the scene being
as set as a poached egg, Uncle, exasperated
at Nephew’s refusal to marry Angela, does a
furious willy-willy in his bath-chair, and
babbles his twofold discovery of Gerald
Pring’s roguery and of liis nephew’s adoration
of Gerald’s beautiful and blameless wife.
Just as Gerald, having got rid of the others
by a gentlemanly “Excuse me,” is about to
brand his wife with a spur, the Bad Man,
Pancho Lopez Post, enters with his burly
bandits. AVhen the humans have been herded

exciting, and bubbling with unexpected fun.

Guy Bates Post has one act to himself, ex-
cept for the few monosyllables necessary to
keep his chat going, and the result is a
dragging of the second act in contrast to
the quickstep of the first. As far as this
paper’s acquaintance with Mexican bandits
goes, Bates Post’s Lopez stands in the first
place, while Leslie Victor’s Uncle is one of
the funniest things Sydney has laughed over
for months. The rest of the long cast are
equal to the calls made on them, which after
the entry of Guy I J . are not many.
So popular have the great contralto’s con-
tests with the big organ in Sydney Town
Hall become that it has been necessary to
tack on three extra concerts to Clara Butt’s
season. Two memorable performances were
hive Biblical Songs,'’ by Dvorak, in which
the lighter tones of the voice pierced its
sombre depths with the effect of spears of
sunlight flashing through cloud masses; and
Gluck s ' Che Faro.” Here the great voice
ranged over all its fields. Such well-tried
lav'ontes as “The Lost Chord,” “Abide with
r- ’ of H °Pe and Glory” and “The
iveys ot Heaven” pop up as encores; and the
lady has included several of the poems of
1. ago re on her bills. One number that calls
tor a special mention is Tennyson’s “St.

Clara presented this to last Saturday’s lis-
teners with devastating effect. Mr. Rum-

tive pianist Antoinette Aussenae plays De-
bussy and Chopin with great charm ; W. F.

thunders of the organ ; and Louise Metters’s

The “Music-box Revue” is in its fourth
mad, glad week at Sydney Opera House.
■/ * *
Rupert Hazell, who is alleged to have
sent George V. into paroxysms of laughter,
bringing a rush of patronage to Sydney
J-ivoli. His method is simple. He puts on
a clerical costume and bleats a lot of non-
sense in the.manner of a meek curate, and
in a few minutes the crowd is yelling its
approval. As an offsider Rupert has Elsie
Day, who warbles a collection of old favor-
ltes to the delight of the sentimentalists of
yesterday. Also new, Jessie Benson, whose
line is character songs, and who leaves no-
thing to chance—her husband conducts the
orchestra while she does the singing. The
programme is strong in people who sing
and dance, and the standard hovers about
the middle line.
In the vaudeville section Harry Taft was
tbe only one to survive the spring-cleaning
at Sydney h uller’s last week. In place of the
departed there is, first, Sam Stern, as a
Jewish policeman, tickling the ribs of the
gods with a rich Palestinian brogue. Sam
also dons a quantity of lingerie, and. with
the assistance of a song or “two in “pidgin”
Dago, impresses the credulous with his im-
personations of an Italian damsel. Denby
and Royal, step dancers, tap the floor with
their patent-leathers much as hundreds of
others have done before; Grace and Keats
are a pair of balladists with good voices and
a confident manner; Nell Fleming, a stunning
soubrette from overseas, is a pleasant song-
and-dauce expert: and Gayle Wyer’s revue
company is blending politics and love in a
little sketch that is full of snap.

In “The Thief of Bagdad.” at Sydney
Prince Edward’s, the athletic Douglas Fair-
banks is mystifying the innocent with the
aid of a: succession of very clever camera-
tricks. But, then, without such things and a
fantastic setting the story would lose half
its appeal. The orchestra follows the twist-
ing story with a colorful score specially
composed for the picture bv Mortimer Wil-
son. “Kings of the Turf,” at Hoyt’s, is the
autobiography of a racing mare, who reviews
the events of her own life for the benefit of
her foal. She possesses none of the wisdom
of the two horses in Anatole France’s “Up-
right Judges,” and the glimpses of her life
will appeal more to the racing tipster and
horse-breeder than the philosopher. “Little
Annie Rooney,” at the Crystal Palace, is
Mary Pickford much older looking, but still
clinging to small-girl parts and juvenile
slapstick farce.
There is nothing so" fresh as the play
itself to report about “No, No, Nanette,”
except that on Saturday Lord Stonehaven
was the guest of the New Princess, and
Monday was made a gala night to celebrate
the show’s 125th performance in Melbourne.

Time does not wither the delight of
“Wildflower,” which profitable bloom con-
tinues to make Melbourne Majesty’s a
popular resort.
Noting a rich harvest still to be gathered,
and with the Athenaeum not available after
to-day, Edna Thomas has been working
overtime. For this week five extra concerts
were announced, two of them matinees. On
Saturday the Aaron Hoffman farce, “Give
and Take,” is to fill the stage, with Harry
Green and “Mo” (Roy Rene) ais the principals.
Napoleon and his wife have the knot
severed nightly at the Melbourne Royal,
before audiences which show appreciation of
the revival of “A Royal Bivoree,” even
though its east is ill-fitting; and the success
of this piece and its predecessor, “The Silver

announce that later on the Starr Co. will

“Charley’s Aunt,” who skerries about the

this is the fifth week of the farce’s revival,
the end of the season is not yet announced.

Herschel Henlere’s quickly established
popularity has given him a long season at
Melbourne Tivoli, but he is due to finish
next Monday. The only change on the bill
is a minor one caused by the arrival of Sid-
ney Clark, a dancing violinist, whose turn
is just passable.

At the Playhouse the Vic. Railways In-
stitute Dramatic Society took three long
hours of Saturday night to present Arnold
Bennett’s “Body and Sotll.” a play which
would be' better for more body. In an attempt
to break away from the life to which she
was born. Lady Ma.b Infold is helped by
Blanche Nixon, who. by giving the patri-
cian s last money away to a charity, leaves
her penniless ; but Blanche says she can get her
friend a job in an office, where the perform-
ance of real useful work will give her the
place in the activity of the world for which
she hungers. Winifred Moverley, who pro-
duced the show and made the self-possessed
Blanche one of its most convincing charac-
ters, had her people well drilled; but the
amateurs, who gave a performance somewhat
stiff in its joints, lost a good deal of the
whimsical humor, which was not of sufficient
quality, anyhow, to make the play an ideal
entertainment. Ruby May was a rather
colorless Lady Mab Infold, who is obviously
moved merely by the desire to make herself a
sensation, and J. Alexander Browne, as
Aaron Draper, was a young man who tangles
himself in twain love affairs in a stiffish
fashion. T. M. Flanagan as the Mar-
quis of Wix was quite good; and W. G.
Southwell (Ezra Clews) and Alice Best
(Mrs. Clews) brought an earnest spirit to
the attempt to extract the humor which is
intended to dwell with the Mayor and
Mayoress who are very proud of their small
greatness.

There were several new turns at the Mel-
bourne Bijou on Saturday, including Wong
Toy Sun. a Chinese “magician” who is very
entertaining, although the dressing of the
act is probably its greatest strength. Queenie
and David Ivaili, who were with the
Hawaiian co. which gave the Athenaeum
Theatre a prosperous start, are on the pro-
gramme as “Kreislers of the Steel Guitar,”
and offer a pleasing enough act; and the
Celia-Marie Duo sing acceptably. The rest
of the programme is much as usual, in-

Protect Your Dependants Against Probate Duty .
TO the man on the land preparation for Probate Duty
is of utmost The tax itself is unusu-
ally heavy. The period required for its
assessment is long. The estate with its income is not
available to dependants until the tax is paid. P. & C.
Probate Assurance meets both contingencies. It pro-
vides dependants with an immediate income, and thereby
protects them against hardships during the waiting
period; it also pays the tax, and thus avoids the frequent
and d sastrous necessity of sacrificing part of the Estate
in order to raise the large sum required, and thereby
forfeiting for always 4 the income derived from it.

MALE CHORUS : “What’s the matter? You
seem either surprised or frightened.”
BALLET: “Both; I just passed the stage-
manager on the stairs, and he didn’t
want to kiss me.”
“C.lv.”: When Clara Butt was a pupil at
the Royal College of Music she took the
name part in a students’ performance of
Gluck’s “Orfeo” in the Lyceum Theatre.
Clara was only in her teens, but the unique
quality and compass of her voice inspired
prophecies which have since been amply ful-
filled. The young singer was a pet of Arthur
Sullivan’s, and would occasionally appear
in a stall box at the Savoy ; but, whether from
a natural self-consciousness or some other
cause, she was a depressing audience. She
never smiled or appeared to appreciate the
show in any way, and any actor knows how
tlpit reacts on the performance. Our con-
tralto, Rosina Brandram, used to get quite
peevish about it. Kennerley Rumford and
I, having been associated with Canterbury
Cathedral (he as a King’s Scholar, I in the
choir), were asked by the Dean and Chapter
to sing the solo music in Mendelssohn’s “St.
I aul > which was given at the Festival com-
memorating the landing of St. Augustine in
Kent. The “St. Paul” music was all right,
but when it came to Handel’s “Hallelujah,”
which concluded the Festival, the baritone
was hopelessly at sea.
‘S.T.S.” : The natural manner on the
platform can be overdone, and Edna Thomas
overdoes it. Her artless patter with her
accompanist about each song, before it is
given, is, delivered with her back to a full
c- -i t au< hence, and is accordingly lost.
Similarly, the spoken matter of "Uncle
lxemus does not carry any distance, and
so fails of its full effect. It is well not to
11 tao conscious of audiences, but, after
all, they have the first claim.
“Caesar’s Ghost”: One of the bullets which
ny by night on the Fitzroy side of Mel-
bourne gave May Beatty a bad scare. On
returning from the theatre to her flat she
discovered a hole in her window and a re-
volver bullet imbedded in the wall. Visions
of some frenzied citizen seeking revenge
upon the actress whose stage role is that
of a slavey who is eternally giving notice
Hashed through her mind as she rang up the
police. They had to explain, apologetically,
that the bullet was from a police revolver
one of four shots fired at a Chinaman who
had been pursued through the Treasury Gar-
dens early that night.
“Mid-Channel”: “L.E.” (B. 17/i>/’25),
endeavoring to support his assertion that
"the revival of some representative play of
the past usually shows that in the art of
drama there has been progress, not reaction,”
scoffs at “asides” and mentions Pinero. I
should like him to name one single aside
of which Pinero has been guilty. He also
says that “even Pinero looks more like an
awful warning than a shining example.”
Australia did not think so when the Bouci-
caults revived “Mrs. Tanqueray” and "His
House in Order.” Neither did London when
“Iris,” originally produced in 15)01, was put
on again at the Adelphi—it has run for
seven months. On the other hand, we
were recently told over the cable that Eng-
lish audiences were fed-up with modern
plays like “The Lady” and “Spring Clean-
ing,” although “The Lady,” I take it.
represents “progress” and “Iris” “reaction.”
“Caesar’s Ghost”: Melbourne has been
furnishing weighty arguments to those who
maintain that the public is ready for a
season of “stock” drama. "On Our Selec-
tion,” a compound of melodrama and farce,
was one of the box-office successes of the
year at the King’s; “Gappy Ricks,” a brisk
story beaten out on the same lines for stage
presentment, did splendid business at the
Athenamm; “The Silver King” has retrieved
the fortunes of the Muriel Starr co. at the
Royal; and "Charley’s Aunt,” which will
run at least five weeks at the New Palace,
has put the little co. that, exploits it on vel-
vet. It doesn’t matter that Neil makes his
representation of the bogus aunt crudely
farcical, or that Jefferson Tait looks and acts
more like a grocer than a lawyer, or that
Frank Harvey is no Silver King—the old
stuff goes on its own meatiness. The man-
ager who gets in with a season of such
pieces as “Man to Man,” “The Lights of
London,” “A Million of Money” and “The
Sign of the Cross,” or even takes excursions
into such old-timers as “Uncle Tom's Cabin”
and “The Octoroon,” is likely to pick up a
hatful of money.
“Hamer”: In “The Silver King” Muriel
Starr, receiving a purseful of money after
she has been so hard up that even a begged
sixpence was a blessing, empties the purse
and practically throws the money at the
would-be evictors. One night some of the
coins flew through where the wall of the
cottage should have been, and landed in the
footlights. They do that sort of thing in
melodrama, of course, but it is not neces*
sary. Maud Jeffries used to count out the
money until she had the amount of her debt;
then, planking it firmly on the table, she
spoke _ the line: “There is your money—
take it.” Very much more effective than
the foolish _ tossing business, for which the
dramatist is probably blamed by members
of the audience.
"C.G.”: Mrs. Edwin Lionel Wilson, dead
in Melbourne, was a great-niece of Ellen
Tree (Mrs. Charles Kean) who, with her
husband, pleased Melbourne so much that
“Society” took the interesting pair to its
buzzum. And that at a time when the
pleasing tradition which classed actors with
rogues and vagabonds had by no means
vanished from the earth. The great-mece
was a member of one of the early J. C. Wil-
liamson opera companies. She left the stage
on her marriage, but continued to be known
in the musical world as Madame Millie Tree
Chapman, and did a great deal for Melbourne
charities.
“Caesar’s Ghost”: To a concert in aid of
wounded soldiers a lady brought a shrill
soprano voice with a shricky top-note that
hit the roof. It seemed to be regarded as an
asset, and polite applause followed the
several songs (she was persistent) in which
it was let loose. But the real criticism of
its quality was supplied by a Digger who
was wakened from a doze as the high shriek
cut the stillness. “Where did that one go?”
he asked, looking aloft, and the next shriek
couldn’t be heard for the laughter.
“A.8.W.”: “Caesar’s Ghost’s” sozzled
warrior-playgoer (B. l/10/’25) reminds me
of the man who, at a Marshall Hall
orchestral concert in the Melbourne Town
Hall years ago, was wakened from
’slumber by a sudden trombone outburst.
“My God !” he yelled, leaping to his feet and
shaping a course for the entrance. “The
Last Trump, and I’m not ready!”
“Mid-C.”: “O.B.B.” (B. S/10/’25), in
enumerating the parts wiric Maxon has
played, omitted one exceptionally fine, per-
formance —his handling of the difficult and
thankless role of Leonard Ferris in Pinero’s
play, “Mid-Channel,” at Sydney Criterion
on December 15, 1918. Others in the cast

"Well, no; they arc often a matter of cheque .”
were Muriel Starr as Zoe Blundell (Ethel
Barrymore's original creation in N’York),
Reg Wykeham and Arthur Styan.
"Lysander”: Whatever the proletariat’s
views may be it responds almost automati-
cally to a call to make outward expression
of loyalty. Herschel Henlere demonstrated
this at the opening of his Melbourne season.
Making a solemn speech about the League
of Nas-i-ons, he invited his audience to
sing the League’s anthem, the hymn which
drew a response from every nation of the
world. He paused, stiffened to attention.
The orchestra struck the old familiar chord.
As one man (and woman) the audience —
from gods to stalled aristocracy and evening-
dressed circle —rose. Then the orchestra
played on into the stirring appeal of “Yes,
We Have No Bananas”—and all know they
had been had. But the habit of acknowledg-
ing “God-save” as Something more than a
signal to catch trams' and trains was there.
“Satis”: The banning of plays by the
British censor is being made to look a some-
what farcical proceeding. There are many
so-called play societies that make a hobby
of producing pieces whose chief recommen-
dation is their very frank treatment of the
sex problem. Any play that achieves a cer-
tain amount of notoriety tlifough having
been refused a license “for public represen-
tation” is eagerly pounced on by these
societies and given what they term a “pri-
vate” performance. Thus “The Harem,”
which was ruled out by the Lord Chamber-
lain (B. l/10/’25), was staged last month
at the Garrick by a company known as
the Repertory Players. The event took
place on a Sunday evening, and, of course,
no money was taken at the doors; equally of
course, the theatre was crammed. The Law
null no doubt step in presently and put its
foot down on these “private” shows.
“Coppertop”: A Brisbane dance-hall is
doing its best to provide comfort for its
patrons. For the benefit of gum-cliewers
metal boxes have been placed outside the
alcoves under a printed notice: “Park your
gum here and not on the floor. By doing this
you help us and help yourself to comfortable
dancing.” Incidentally, another notice is
displayed prominently: “If you have an argu-
ment to settle, kindly take it outside. No-
body in the hall is interested except your
two selves.”
“Lysander”: When an actor-producer
takes liberties with an old play by altering
its costuming and interpolating topical gags
lie (or she) might as well go the whole dis-
tance and bring its atmosphere and machin-
ery U P to date. “The Silver King” and
‘ Charley’s Aunt” have been revived in Mel-
bourne, and it has been abundantly pro ml
that they still have their appeal. To the
seasoned playgoer, however, there are in
each case blemishes on the stagecraft of
1025 which drown the fun and jar the enter-
tainment. No amount of generosity towards
Anno Domini will make feasible to-day the
crude “aside” and galumphing sub-play and
by-play admired of our ancestors, or lessen
the distaste aroused by spotlight-basking and
preposterous “curtains” when the dead rise
and bow to eagerly-awaited applause. Nellie
Denver in a bingle and a knee-lengtli tube-
frock is not incongruous in 1925; neither is
Donna Lucia Alvadorez in sock-garters and
tt waistless and suspendered corset. But
heroics and soliloquies, slapstick and roared
asides arc.
“E.T.” i W. W. Kelly* the original pro-
ducer of “A Royal Divorce” (B. S/iO/’25).
had the reputation of being One of the cutest
showmen in tile business*
but he came off second-best
in one deal. During the old
piece’s stay in a Lancashire
town he found Oil his Idst
night that his 0 O'clock re-
turn of tire takings was just
four shillings short ,of a sum
that would, on his rising-
scale agreement with the pro-
prietor of the theatre, entitle
him to an additional five per
cent; Of the gross. He de-
cided to make sure of tin'
extra percentage. Going out
into the principal thorough-
fare, 'he met two youths.
“Would you like to see
the magnificent Napoleonic
drama, “A Royal Divorce’
he said. “Ay, we wud aii’
all,” was the reply. Kelly
thereupon handed tlieni two
shillings apiece to pay lot
admission to the pit. He kept
his eye bn, them, and saw
them turn into the entrance
of the theatre well pleased
with his little manoeuvre. But
when he got his final return
he was disgusted to find
that his share was £lO less
than he had confidently anti-
cipated, the gross takings
being still 2s. shy. The canny
lads, instead of going into
the pit, had had a shilling’s-
worth each in the gallery.
“Forebridge”: The acting in the film
version of “Charley’s. Aunt” is above the
American average, but the sub-titles are not.
Lord “Babbs,” described as an “upper-
classman” at St. Olde’s, Oxford, suggests
that 13 is a lucky number, and advises his
fiancee's father to “Go play it.” Sir Francis
Chesney, a retired Indian Army officer, visit-
ing his nephew (‘also an “upper-classman”)
at Oxford, announces himself thus: “We’re
broke; I guess you'll have to quit college.”
The stern old aristocrat later improves on
this by introducing himself to a lady with
the words “I am Sir Francis Chesney.” It’s
a wonder he didn’t end the sentence with
“kid” or “sister.”
From an Adelaide critic:—
The Society of Arts show in Adelaide has for once
brought in a lot of work from the' eastern States.
In fact, Jackson and Dora Wilson rather dominate it.
The lady’s work can now hardly be distinguished from
that of Cumbrae Stewart, unless by the extra clothing
worn by the sitters. Jackson has never before been
seen to such advantage here; he is acquiring a
Streeton touch. Bryant has the sinking of the
Australia, not so impressive as one would expect;
and Banks scores with a brilliant, tricky Fete
Nocturne. Local artists are always busy at this
show, seeking the Melrose and other prizes. Figure-
painting has received a big stimulus, and some rather
terrible things appear during the transition stage;
still, the best are pretty good. Young Boxall gains
the figure award with a self-portrait, and completes
a remarkable double by winning the landscape prize
too —a really good work, this. Giles also is im-
proving rapidly, and he gets the seascape award.
Some Art bloomings in Melbourne: —
Melancholy broods over a number of George Col-
ville’s pictures at the New Gallery. He has
chased the spirit of the bush into her fastnesses,
and the scared creature has not shown him her
delight. Perhaps if he had sat down in meditation
with her instead of hurrying after her, he would have
succeeded better. Still there is some excellent color
sense and delicacy of treatment. “Sunburst at
Twilight” (No. 26) is particularly appealing, there is
spaciousness in “Ocean from the Hills” (No. 43),
and “Silhouette” (No. 23) is well conceived. In
“Sunlight Benediction” (No. 10) a good composition
is marred by poor treatment of the shrubs; and
the massing of yellow and greens in “Riverbank,
Wyandyte” (No. 4), rather spoils that picture. The
paint in “Standing Guard” (No. 3) also hits the eye
heavily. But, although the standard of work shown
in a recent exhibition at the Athenamm Gallery
is not fully maintained, the work is good, and the
catalogue prices suggest a modesty which is amazing.
Last week Room 12 of the Equitable Building
housed an all-too-brief show of painting on china by
Miss B. B. Davis. It is all very dainty work, with
Australian decorative schemes employed where old
European designs are usual; and it was backed by
some domestic ornaments which are very charming.
“A FAR, FAR BETTER THING."
[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
“I always think if anything goes wrong on the
stage that it is far better to own up frankly, and
to start again.”—Dame Melba’s Melodies and
Memories.
The tenor tripped upon his way
(A sprightly tenor he) ;
The tenor tripped (alack-a-day !)
Upon his way which, sad to say,
Led to an upper 0.
lie made no effort, fruitless, wild
(An honest tenor he),
To smother up the slip so mild ;
Like any child he frankly smiled,
And signalled them D. C.
The tenor tripped still worse, alas
(Unlucky tenor he),
But was not quite the blatant ass
Who tries to pass a blunder crass
By cloaking it, not he!
Again, with gesture bland and grave
(Courageous tenor he),
De Capo was the sign he gave,
And not a stave lie tried to shave
That song’s entirety.
And later to that artists’ bane,
A critic cold, said he;
“To blunder on I would not deign;
1 think it plain to start again
Is better artistry.
“When something comes your part to mar,
As Melba says,” said he,
“ ’Tis better not for breath to spar;
Whoe’er you are, ’tis better far
To start again, you see.”
Oh, plain the answer that he got
(Incautious tenor he) :
“Since to have heard you is my lot,
I think, God wot, far better not
To start at all, since!”

Important
Treasury Notice.
I feel it is my duty to set out the position of the War Conver-
sion Loan in order that those persons who have not already
converted their holdings may know that their chances of getting
into the Conversion Loan are rapidly slipping away from them.
When the Loan was opened the securities to be redeemed
amounted to £67,000,000. We have since received cash and
conversion applications amounting to £51,000,000. According to
these figures, it would appear that a total of £l 6,000,000 has still to
be raised. The amount which the public have an opportunity of
subscribing is less than £16,000,000 however, because it has been
decided to let the National Debt Sinking Fund Commissioners take
up a considerable portion of it.
The end of this Loan operation, therefore, is in sight, and all
those who desire to take advantage of the liberal terms offered
should act without delay.
As previously stated, the subscriptions already amount to
£5 1,000,000. This total is made up of £37,400,000 of conversion
applications and £ 1 3,600,000 of cash applications.
The public still hold maturing securities amounting to
£2 7,500,000, and there is strong ground for belief that most of the
owners of that large amount of securities desire to convert into the
new Loan. A great many of them certainly will be disappointed,
because the Treasury will not be in a position to accept conversion
applications for even half that amount. To avoid disappointment,
immediate application is necessary, because the principle of “first
come first served” must be followed.
The fact that so much as £13,600,000 has been received by
way of new cash applications really means that new subscribers
have come into the Loan, and will necessarily push out some who
are already in it but who have been slow to take advantage of the
opportunities offered them.
When the last Loan was floated by the Commonwealth in
Australia, it was necessary to stop the receipt of applications before
the date which had originally been fixed for its closing, and many
who had intended to put money into the Loan were necessarily
shut out.
I desire that present holders of the maturing Loans, particularly
the small holders, shall understand, if they desire to convert their
holdings, immediate action is necessary, because the time for the
closing of the Loan is at hand

THE “LONGREACH” is comfortable right

ing-in period such as some saddles do. Note
how the flap is sewn direct on to the seat
without’ the usual skirt—this gives a nar-
rower non-chafing grip. The pads differ in
shape from the orthodox stock pad and are
set well up along the rider’s thighs, giving
perfect security to the rider. The workman-
ship and materials are first-class throughout
and it is fitted with folded girth, bevelled
leathers and solid nickel four-bar stirrups.

Bobs: You don’t know the man. Walsh
doesn’t lack courage, and so much can’t be said for
some others on his side... .Garner 0.: If it had been
a little less horrible it might have got through....
A.J.P.; Beyond our limit of space... .Robert W.: The
explanation of the ghosts is too thin.... Irvine D.:
A fair sonnet ending weakly. See if you can’t
strengthen it... . Frances TANARUS.: A thought in it here and
there; but rather clumsily done... .T.H.P.: Always
hungry for new and bright matter.... T. Eyk: Too
much of what it says has been said too often.. . .
X Ray: All those other things you mention had their
enthusiastic supporters too. It will be kinder to
thousands to wait for something more definite....
O. : Space not available at present. And you
come to some foolish incidental conclusions, what-
ever your judgment on the main issue may be....
P. ; The nut at dot (2) travels faster than the nut
at dot (I) to complete the circle... .C.W.; Nothing
unfamiliar in either of the long ones... .Dima: As
far as the records show, there is no such person....
William R.; Burned ; and even the flame was blue.
. ...H.J.L.: Nothing very exciting about “8i11”....
W. C. (Midlands) ; Not much story and what there
is isn’t easy to swallow... .K.A. A.; No g00d....
M.W.S.: The wifi; who didn’t run away has been
used rather often... .Marie D.: Verse slight and has
nothing fresh about it... .F.P.8.; Misses Ruby
H.; The yarns of rain coming after drought have been
told with almost every possible variation. Yours holds
nothing new....G.T. (Elstermvick): Both have
points, but miss. It is the metre that is chiefly at
fault... .C.L.C.; You say it is in blank verse. Some
is, some isn’t. The general effect is not attractive....
J. D. McD.: Very poor. .. .Ralph 0.: You select your
words badly and have a wild notion of rhyme....
... .Richard H. (Jun.) ;No use at all. .. .Mary L. L.:
Horrible without being convincing.... Swingletree:
An old trick and a mechanical sequel.... E.W.W.:
Not much use repeating old things in the cJd way.
. ...Terese; Very poor. . . .P. O. Mac; There is an
idea, but you handle it too weakly; and the verse
is clumsy... .Frank B.; The verse, though loose and
rather commonplace in phrasing, might have had a
certain novelty in 1860....L.G. (Hackney): The
point is interesting enough, but you’ve spun no yarn
round it.... J.A.D.; Some if it is good; the tram
suggestion is ugly... .Ripponlea: “The Factory Chim-
ney” has thrilling features:—
Haughtily, and at an awe-inspiring elevation,
Though containing a considerable quantity of smut
Like the average commercial traveller’s conversation,
Th’ Factory Chimney may be seen to jut!
Obviously for it in position to stick
Would of necessity be several bricks thick ;
So that we can conclude from a superficial glance
That th’ shaft isn’t as big as we supposed, perchance.
Such a chimney is absolutely necessary for a factory
fire
But for household utility more than we require.
Not only that. But beside being superfluous
Appearing over a cottage somewhat incongruous.
In Melbourne of these colossal columns there is no
dearth;
And they are as beautiful as any upon this Earth,
Both in color, symmetry and design.
In this respect Melbourne’s smoke-stacks are very fine.
How it’s cleaned I’m afraid I’ve no idea,
And consequently must refer you to a civil engineer.
... .Dubbleyu : The Bulletin wants to pay for every-
thing it prints. Make your claim to the accountant if
it hasn’t been paid for before publication....
O. (Leichhardt): Painful little tale with little
likelihood and no point... .E.B. (Melb.) : Not badly
written, but only picture show stuff.... Old Buttons:
The verse is good enough to make us sure it should
be a lot better... .0.W.W.: Not built well enough.
....Frederic H.: Very bad....M.0. (Leeton) : Too
rugged; it doesn’t match the thought C.L.C.:
“The Test” doesn’t quite hang together.... Vincent
S.; Tired old themes in thoroughly moral verse which
bumps and staggers. . . .I.P. (Northcote) : Misses....
M.T. (Cremorne) : Dull.. ..F. 11. (Abbotsford): “The
Lesson” treads old ground; “Nature” is too mys-
terious. .. .Chalcedony; Yo.ur limping lines suggest
that you have not much verse sense.... A.P.M.: A
little too thin... .E.R.N.: “The Dentist” only says
a few obvious things....D.P.M.: You get a few good
lines and then let thought and metre go mad....
P. ; Not badly handled and has some feeling,
but the idea is crude... .Kitty B.: Not up....
V.J. (Caulfield): Weak little hash-up of common-
places. .. .W.S.S.: The cat hasn’t enough interest....
C.E.L.P.: Must go back.... Horton B.: A not very
convincing bit of horror. .. .David W.: Not much of
a snake yarn 1.D.C.: The makings of a story are
there. Try to do better with the material.... Trig:
Points all too small. .. .Whistler: The most awful for
24 hours.—Telopea Boy: Nearly a dead heat
with “Whistler’s”... .Diddy II.: Impassible... .G.T.
(Elsternwick) : One might do. .. .King Olaf: Dreadful
parody... .Charles C.: A correct enough sonnet of the
second-best form, but without much other merit....
E.J.G.: Not enough skill to carry the rather thin
yarn.. . .W.E.C.: Sorry, but it’s some distance 0ff....
Yea: Of local interest 0n1y... .E.M.: In spite of a
little difficulty in guessing what it is about, we
think it has remarkable originality:—
Tn stately attitude I sit
While Justice sleeps on time a bit.
To deal his fellow man a dart
Of Wisdom from within his heart
Will be a sentence of a tart.
Man’s carnal Mind is like a Pig,
No light within for Man to dig
Out of all Wisdom’s treasure got
Which hid from carnal flesh that rot
When man hath finished up his lot.
.... Jessie M.: As slight as our own acquaintance
with the King of Abyssinia... .D.L.C.: Very mild
re-dressing of hard-worked ideas... .D.E. (Orange):
An unsatisfying yarn in poor verse... .T.A.E.: Merely
a mass of words. ...W.E.8.: Nothing has been added
to make the man and mouse yarn more interesting.
....Paul R.: The interest in King John is very
slight, but the verse could be lots worse.... Curlew:
“Orara” is pretty enough, but doesn’t get to any-
thing. .. .W.R.H.: Bad verse, mixed grammar,
muddled tale.... A.E.C.: Doesn’t stir a pulse
J.W.D.; The verse is too poor to carry it.
TO AUTISTIC (AND INARTISTIC)
CORRESPONDENTS.
J.O. : You make your perspective of blancmange
and your figures of ironbark. ... L.B.: Dreadful....
R.M.: Sell those Oxford trousers and learn to draw
with the proceeds...-F.L.T.: Your ducks look like
ham-bones going for a stroll A.D.M.: Fashion-
pi atey; but there is promise in it....B.C.: The
deformed person beneath the car doing abdominal
exercises earns you this week’s dunce’s cap... .G.S.C.:
If contributors only studied the class of drawings
we print and compared their work with them, there
would be less need for this column.

WORKS: YARRAVILLE, VICTORIA.
One of the most interesting exhibits at
the Melbourne Show was the old plough that
was brought over from the Speck by the
Hentys in 1534, and turned the first sod in
Victoria.
“A.E.Y.”: I was introduced at Boonah
< Q.) the other day to the family of a dairy-
farmer, and learned that their respective
names were Michelangelo, Voltaire, Nap-
oleon and Josephine. The children didn’t
seem to mind.
Among the slogans entreating the public
to consume this and that more freely may
now be included “Eat More Seaweed.” Of
recent years the M.L. health authorities have
been perturbed by the increase of goitre, par-
ticularly among children. Maui Pomere now
comes along with the suggestion that the
pakeha should revert to the old Maori pre-
ventive and include seaweed in his diet.
“Stellsby”: Handed over to. the ship-
breakers, the Glasgow-built 40-year-old four-
masted barque Australia, which spent the
best part of her lifetime ploughing between
the U.K. and the Commonwealth. Her last
homeward voyage from Port Adelaide occu-
pied 174 days, so it was time she threw in
her checks. In her younger days she was
for a short period on the Peruvian register
as the Elisa Lilim, and the Yanks also owned
her for a time as the Phyllis.
The death of Major-General C, W. Mel-
vill, Commandant of the M.L. Forces, re-
moves one of the Dominion’s most distin-
guished soldiers at 47. The son of a V.C.,
he started his military career auspiciously,
and linked up with the M.L. Staff Corps
under the defence scheme. After good work
in the war he returned to M.L., aiid in 1924
succeeded Chaytor as Commandant. He was
a capable and popular officer, and earned the
admiration and confidence of his men in
several big engagements.
The irrepressible Tommy Ryan is again in
the limelight. Just as he was getting a little
on the nerves of his S.A. constituency he
emigrated to Vic., and, because it was war-
time and Blackburn had “worsened,” Tommy
jumped into the Leg. Assembly for Essen-
don. After seven years there he took a trip
to Britain, and helped Baldwin to gain his
great victory. Now he has licked a big
bunch of other Nats., and has secured the
non-Labor selection for Ballarat. From
Deakin to Ryan is as far as from Dan to
Beersheba, but lie is a less of a political risk
to take than McGrath, the retiring Labor
member.
Queensland Ministers gain a working
knowledge of all departments, owing to their
accommodating habit of taking one another’s
place temporarily; it’s seldom that there
isn’t a Minister or two away on sick leave
or tour or holiday. The practice has its
advantages at times. Alf Jones, as Minis-
ter for Mines, made a recommendation to
the Home Secretary. A few days later Jim
Stopford went away to the North ; Alf Jones
took his place, and as Acting-Home Secre-
tary gravely approved of the recommenda-
tion he had himself made as Minister for
Mines.
“Jesmond” : Pinus insipnis may have the
advantages cited by “J.D.” (B. 10/9/’25),
but it is no good to the man who wants to
make money. Some years ago Melbourne
companies scoured Victoria for the timber
and paid up to £5 a tree as it stood ; but
since then it has become almost unsaleable.
During the past year or two I’ve come across
scores of farmers burning it where more suit-
able fuel was available. The explanation in
every case was that the trees were felled for
sale, but that the price now offered would
not pay freight. Though admittedly a useful
timber the market at present is limited, and
as there seems to be no certainty of improve-
ment there is some reason in the objection
to including it largely in reforesting schemes.
The Fauna and Flora Board of South Aus.
has issued a glowing report of the year’s
work on Flinders Chase reserve, at the west-
ern end of Kangaroo' Island, where it is
hoped to save from extermination the birds
and beasts menaced on the mainland. Native
bears —rare in S.A. —have lately been turned
loose; also rat kangaroos, bred by Prof.
Wood-Jones at Adelaide University. A re-
cent improvement is a 14-acre enclosure,
wire-netted though otherwise left wild. It
is to have a threefold use—keeping animals
under observation prior to complete freedom,
making available a supply for exchange with
other sanctuaries, and ensuring that admir-
ing visitors can always see a beast or two
for their money.
Conan Doyle’s spirit message about an
impending world-disaster is absurdly vague,
but an Adelaide man, Victor Cromer,
who holds a diploma in education, is supply-
ing the details. Germany, Russia and Tur-
key are to enter into alliance, and a univer-
sal war will start in October next year and
last till 1930. And Cromer ought to know,
for “in 1907, before 1000 delegates at the
International Socialist Congress in Stutt-
gart, where I was an Australian delegate, I
predicted the war of 1914.” He throws in
for good measure a prediction that during
the coming war a stupendous earthquake will
“divide Europe into three great islands, and
alter the configuration of the planet gener-
ally” : also “a large portion of Japan will
slip into the sea soon.” However, Aus-
tralia’s only share in the trouble, apparently,
is “a vast immigration as the result of the
cataclysms in the Old World.”
“Alwyn”: Apropos the N-S.W. habit of
yelling “Bushrangers!” when the “gag” is
applied in Parliament, one N.S.W. Minis-
ter did actually take to the road. A settler
was bailed up in the Pittwater district by
a man armed with a gun who, declining
money, demanded food. Some months later
the settler was one of a deputation to the
P.M.G. asking for postal accommodation.
Though he graciously received his visitors
the Minister regretted that he couldn’t supply
the deputation’s requirements. Whereupon
the settler, who happened to be the chief
spokesman, asked for a word with the Min-
ister privately. He then point-blank asked
him if he was not the man who relieved
him of a parcel of groceries near Pitt-
water. “Yes,” was the reply; “but don’t
talk about it. We were camping out and
had to get food somewhere.” That was
in the late ’sixties, when Daniel Egan, one-
time member for Monaro and a great prac-
tical joker, was the Ma State’s P.M.G.
The postal accommodation arrived soon after-
wards.

ALWAYS SAFE IN A
BIG BLOW
No matter how stiff the wind is the “Billabong” is safe. The Automatic
Governor and Speed Regulator presses the brake on the windwheel
and slows it down to a safe pumping speed. When a gale blows up,
the Regulator throws the wheel out of the wind, and does not bring
it back till it is safe to do so.
OIL ONCE EVERY SIX
MONTHS
The new enclosed gear “Billabong’’ lias doubled
massive gears working in an enclosed gear-box.
Partially fill this gear-box with oil every six
months; that is all the attention it wants. Always
safe in a gale—and no time lost in inspecting or
oiling. Instal “Billabongs.”

“Stellsby”: At the Melbourne Show a
cocky and a townie tied in the correct esti-
mate of the fat bullock’s weight (1104 Mb.).
But they weren’t all like that. Other esti-
mates ranged from 00161 b. down to 11611 b.!
Brought up at the City Court, Melbourne,
recently on a charge of stealing two bottles
of beer, a prisoner admitted to no fewer than
359 convictions since 1899. A corrective
system that can’t do better than that had
better think about a change.
“Weaver” : When the bounty on Bradford
tops was granted, some 16 years ago, it was
done with the object of encouraging the ex-
port of some of our partly-manufactured
wool. Japan at once became a large buyer.
If a similar bounty is extended to Australian-
grown locally-spun cotton, it should have the
effect of promoting an export trade in cotton
yarns, more especially in the heavier counts.
“Kay” : I can nominate another Jew who
regards manual work without hostility (B.
17/9/’25) —a resident of the W.A. goldfields
since the early days, he toiled for many years
as a miner on the Golden Mile. Finally he
joined the police force; he is the only one
of his persuasion in the State. Incidentally,
he has been presented with a watch by
Kalgoorlie citizens in recognition of con-
spicuous bravery in arresting an escaped
lunatic whose bullet ruined the timekeeper
which the constable carried in his breast
pocket.
Alf Jones, Minister for Mines (Q.), is an
instantaneous assayer whose snap judgments
on specimens sent in to the Department usu-
ally turn out pretty correct. He is the
humorist of the Ministry, and would pro-
bably rank higher than third in the order of
precedence but for his incorrigible habit of
telling funny stories against himself. After
office hours, when he is not swapping yarns
or picking winners, he drops into poetry.
Years ago one of his poems carried off first
prize at an eisteddfod, and he has never
been the same man since.
“A.8.W.”: Re parsons who came out of
bank-managers’ chairs (B. 24/9/'25). The
Rev. Sydney L. Buckley, headmaster of Mel-
bourne’s No. 2 Anglican school, Ivanlioe
Grammar, although not a bank-manager,
graduated from a Yic. Savings’ Bank stool,
via night studies and special lectures, to an
Arts degree, continuing with a theological
course at Trinity, and thence to ordination at
St. Paul’s. He enlisted as a private for the
Big Scrap, but was buttonholed in camp
for a padre, and sailed as such. Homeward
bound, four years later, he conducted account-
ancy classes on his troopship and primed
many Diggers for a business career.
“Saaedi” : Prices for store sheep may_be
high in “Jacky Iloo’s” district (B. 3/9/ 25),
but they are lower than usual in the Central
West of K. S. Wales. This has nothing to
do with the season, which is excellent, nor
with the price of wool, which is better than
had been expected, but is attributed to the
remarkably good autumn and winter lambing.
Several stations are now, for the first time
in many years, overstocked, and since most
pastoral properties are sufficiently filled the
surplus is proving rather difficult to sell.
What makes conditions worse is that the
mutton-export trade is not as brisk as it
was in bygone years; and the strike hold-
up will not improve matters.
Middle Park (Melb.) possesses a band of
hardy veterans who would sooner miss break-
fast than the morning dip even in the depth
of winter; the eldest of the Spartan 12 is 75,
and two others are 70. Recently one of the
septuagenarians, ex-Sub-Inspector of Police
R. Taylor, issued a challenge to a compara-
tive youngster for a swimming match over
a measured distance, but collapsed right at
the end, his first remark when pulled out
of the water and resuscitated being “Did I
beat him?” To recognise the oldster’s pluck,
Ins pals made him a presentation, and the
hardy tribe assembled at the baths at 7
o’clock on a nippy morning to hand over
the gift.
“Sixenate”: Victoria’s roll iof highway
accidents keeps mounting. For the first eight
months of this year there were 3194 com-
pared with 2783 last year; and 2457 were
caused by motor-cars. The fatalities were
278 (130 caused by motor-cars). Swanston-
street intersections made a fine haul; any
man who really wants to see an accident
can’t do better than hang around that busy
thoroughfare. Usually the last four months
of the year, when visitors are in for the
Show, Henley and the Cup, give the biggest
lift to the roll, and the traffic-police consider
that the tally may easily ascend to 6000 be-
fore the end of the year. It is a ghoulish
prospect, and the worst of it is there is
more talk than action about Melbourne’s
traffic problem.
James Larcombe, the bantam of the
Queensland Government, is a politician of
the second generation. His dad was member
for Iveppel. Young Jimmy was secretary of
the Carters and Drivers’ Union at Rock-
hampton (his native town) before he took
to politics. His knowledge of finance
(acquired as a lemonade carter) and his
racy speech marked him out for speedy
advancement, and he has had a long term of
office as member of the Public Works Com-
mission, Minister for Justice, Minister for
Public Works and State Enterprises, and for
the last 54 years Minister for Railways.
Jimmy’s present job is an easy one. All he
has to do is look after the deficit, give the
railway men everything they ask, and explain
away the daily accidents.
“Forebridge”: “Only Australian” ranks
Galway (Ireland) as the next-best harbor to
Sydney (B. l/10/’25). Four years ago I
was stationed on the west coast of Ireland
in a vessel which only displaced 800 tons and
drew barely nine feet of water, but she was
too big to be able to berth in Galway. Actu-
ally it is not a harbor at all, merely a
shallow haven at the mouth of a swift-
running stream. The only ship of more
than 1000 tons that I ever saw in Galway
Roads was a wreck: she had dragged her
anchors and fetched up on the breakwater
during a gale! Men-o’-war were specially
warned against this “harbor” by the naval
authorities. To sum up, as one who has been
a navigator as well as “a world-traveller in all
the seven seas,” I should rank Galway Roads
as one of the most insecure anchorages in
the world, whilst the actual port of Galway
is about on a par with Ballina or Cooktown.

The Singer by the Sea.
[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
HREE times the same dream came to
me that night.
Three times I saw, by silhouetting
trees,
A singing maiden in a moon-blue light,
Naked by moon-blue seas.
The dawn aroused me, but that vision still
Poised in my sight as daylight leapt the hill.
The tented mining-camp about me woke.
Morning grew’ populous with calls of men,
And scented spires of eucalyptus smoke
Wavered and spired again,
While here and there an axe flashed high in
ringing
Music that set some barebacked miner sing-
ing.
But through the sights and sounds of morn-
ing-rise
The vision lingered and the lonely voice—
A dream-girl singing clear before my eyes—
Until I had no choice.
I rolled my swag and through the white sun-
glow
Wandered I knew not where nor cared to
know,
By cliffy buttresses of basalt hills,
By boobyalla-scrub and belts of trees,
Down where the sunset like a rainbow spills
Over the western seas,
And on beneath the moon, where great waves
roar
In league-long thunder on a lonely shore.
There, as an outpost of the universe,
A shanty stood, one window winking slow’.
I strolled inside and slung a comrade-curse
To those I chanced to know. •
I dumped my swag and, shouting drinks all
round,
Blasted that tavern for its jovial sound.
Ten tangled voices wrangled through the
room
In song and yarn and oath and sudden
laughter.
The dice were tossed against the day of doom
Or any day thereafter ;
And wandering elbows set the glasses reel-
ing,
Or lean long men struck matches on the
ceiling.
But I was W’eary of the sight of men.
Beyond the cloud of smoke I saw that
bright
Girl of the dreams, I yarned awhile and
then
Strolled out and through the night,
Leaving the noise and laughter and the
brown
Beer that goes coolly cataracting down.
So, dream-disconsolate, I trod the lone
Beaches that curved by moon-blue reach
and bay.
The drowsy breakers droned a thunder-tone
And flashed in lazy spray;
And every while a breeze would stir and peep
Out of the warmth and once more fall asleep.
Mile after leisured mile by beach and dune,
Mile after mile between the hills and sea —
Sudden I stopped. A faint and pleading
tune
Drifted uncertainly
Out of the night, with lulls and languid
trills —
A girl-voice far along those lone coast hills.
Climbing a bouldery steepness from the shore,
I followed still the sound of that wild song.
It ceased an eerie w’liilo, then came once
more,
More near and clear and strong.
And upward on an isthmian crest I went
Wrapt in a rapture of bewilderment.
The wide warm night, the wonder of the
moon,
Shadow’s of bush, the languorous ocean-call,
While the surrendering glamor of that tune
Flow’ed softly over all!
And w’here a cliff leaned high above the seas
The singer stood by silhouetted trees.
A girl just ripening into womanhood.
Lightly she poised there, clear against the
far
Curtain of sky. Most beautiful she stood,
Nude as old statues are;
But warm and silken-soft beneath the bright
Moon that had robed her nakedness in light.
One hand caressed the rounded breasts of her.
And one held back a thunder-cloud of
tresses.
Within my heart there ran a sudden stir
Of panic-stricken guesses.
Three times my dream had seen her, moon-
light-clad,
Seen that sweet face —but not that face gone
mad.
For madness blurred the window’s of her
eyes,
Madness had tossed her garments round
her feet,
Madness was rocked upon the fall and rise
Of that wild song and sweet,
The madness born of wardering, lost, in
lonely
Ranges where no tracks load, but wild fears
only.
All unaw’are of me she stood and sang.
Note after note melodiously fled
Into the night, while through her mind there
rang
What clanging chords of dread !
I spoke; she ceased. Aaid unashamed she
stept
Forw’ard and fell and clutched my feet and
wept.
I hid her beauty in the clothes that lay
Scattered about her; and I carried her
Down to the beach and all the moon-blue
way
Back to the shanty. Tlaere
Ten tangled voices husheld their songs of
thunder
And ten men gazed in reverential wonder.
We tended her. How wliisperingly we crept,
Barefoot and tiptoe, on that gum-slabbed
floor!
And through a night and day and night she
slept.
Then, at the open door,
Suddenly, smiling to the morning skies,
She stood with reason radiant in her eyes.
I rode with her that singing morn away
Over the ranges to her far farm home,
Over the ranges where, by night and day,
Wherever feet might roam.
Searchers w T ere questing the lost girl whom I,
Dream-led, had found beneath the moon-blue
sky.
And through what singing morns and ever-
more
On through what love-enchanted hills of
life,
The bright girl-wonder of the moon-blue
shore
Rides by my side as wife!
And who more truly mine, by mystic right.
Than she who called me so through moon-
blue night.
N.s.w.
BARTLETT ADAMSON.
The Abdication of Queen Elizabeth.
[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
WHEN Elizabeth Hodges took excep-
tion to the ill-timed rcma-rks of
the foreman at Wiggins’s cake-
factory, she did not confine herself to any
mere verbal protest. With the deliberation
of one •who takes pride in a task well done,
she soundly boxed the man’s ears, put on
her hat and coat and walked out of the
packing-room. A firm believer in action, she
went straight to a rival concern, the Water-
loo Biscuit Company, made a clean breast
of everything, and was engaged on the spot;
for Jamieson, the manager there, liked spirit
in his employees, even though he would never
have admitted the fact openly.
Next morning, exactly on time, the Water-
loo girls caught their first glimpse of Liz.
She wore a hat of indeterminate color, a
short, green skirt and a blouse of some
kaleidoscopic material. The girls blinked.
They blinked a second time when Liz re-
moved her hat and disclosed a shock of un-
believably red hair, carefully trimmed in the
latest shingle. Choosing a convenient peg
for her things the newcomer crossed to the
packing-tables while rolling up her
“Mornin’, girls!” she said cheerfully. “I’m
Liz ’Odges what useter work fer Wiggins.
They ain’t got no time fer ladies over there,
so I’m ’ere t’ stay. Let’s git movin’.”
After watching her for a few minutes
Blake, the foreman, decided that Liz needed
neither instruction nor advice. Blake w’as
a very fair judge of character, and he knew
when to hold his peace. Before the end of
the week he had reported to Jamieson that
the new T girl was easily the smartest packer
in the room. She could turn out almost tw’ice
as many tins as the next-best at the tables.
Liz had established herself.
Within a fortnight she was the uncrowned
queen of the factory. By virtue of her pro-
ficiency at the tables she assumed the dic-
tatorship of the packing-room. It was Liz
who apportioned the coat-and-hat racks
among the other employees; it was Liz who
decided where lunch was to be eaten:
it w T as Liz who arranged which dance-
hall the crowd would attend, and which
men were to be boycotted and which
showered with favors. At first there
were heard mild murmurings against
this modest form of tyranny, but those mur-
murs never grew into outspoken words. In
the memories of the other girls was the time
when Liz had “pasted” that obstreperous
foreman over at Wiggins’s.
Then came Molly Callaghan. Molly, too,
had had long and varied experience in pack-
ing-rooms. At the branch factory in Bris-
bane Molly had a record ; and she had been
a dictator even as Liz was a dictator. But
when she made her first appearance at the
Waterloo establishment her demeanor was
quiet, her dress orthodox, her nature taciturn.
“Git an eyeful of ’er!” exclaimed Liz,
coming out of the dressing-room that
morning.
Molly looked at the other calmly, but said
nothing in reply.
Striding across the room wfith a sneer on
her lips, Liz stood before the new arrival
and looked her over. There was something
about Molly that antagonised Liz at once.
Perhaps it w T as her quiet ways.
“Know anythin’ about packin’?” demanded
Liz with a smirk at her audience.
“Why, yes, I’ve had a little experience,”
replied the other girl sweetly.
“Well, you’ve gotter git a move on ’ere.
They ain’t no room fer loafers, see?”
“Perhaps you’re the manager of this
place,” said Molly. “Is that so?”
“No, it ain’t so.”
“Then I don’t have to listen to you, do
I? And I don’t intend to either” —this with
frigid finality.
Letting her hands drop from her hips, Liz
bent forward and thrust her face within a
few r inches of the new girl’s.
“I want none of yer lip,” she warned.
“Don’t try no back-talk if yer value yer com-
fort. I ain’t standin’ nothin’ like that.”
“Do you know” —Molly still spoke in a
subdued tone of voice—“l’ve seen people like
you before.. I shouldn’t wonder if you’ve
got most of the girls here just scared to
death.”
“We’ll argue this out later on in the
piece!” panted Liz. her hands trembling and
her bosom heaving. “.Tes' now it’s time ter
git started. If yer know 'ow, yer better git
goin’.”
Blake, w’ho was an interested witness of
this little scene, placed the new girl at a
table directly opposite Liz in order that
they could keep an eye oh each other if
they so desired. For Blake's knowledge of
human nature was supplemented by a sense
of humor.
When the day started. Liz took a deep
breath, leaned well over the table and went
to work. She labored swiftly but carefully.
Deftly the layers were thrown into the tins
and the little pasteboard partitions placed

Why Kidney Disease Is so Serious?

A \\'
“Every Picture
Tells a S tory’
The reason kidney disease is so serious is that it
comes on unnoticed, and often gains a firm hold of
the sufferer before he knows what is wrong with him.
Doan’s Backache Kidney Pills should be used
immediately there is any sign of Backache, Dizzy Spells,
Aching Pains in the Loins, Water Troubles, Gravel,
Rheumatic Pains, Sleeplessness, Irritability, Watery
Swellings in the Ankles or beneath the Eyes, Stiffness of
the Joints and Lumbago.
Doan’s Pills thoroughly cleanse the kidneys and
bladder, and assist them in their great work of filtering
the blood. But be careful to get the genuine Doan’s Pills.
TWO COMPLETE CURES.
Mrs. S. T. Burrows, 19 Springside Street, Rozelle, Sydney,
says:—"ln common with many others I have nothing but good
to say for Doau’s Backache Kidney Bills. Some few years ago
I was suffering; a lot with my kidneys, and in consequence was
troubled with, pains across the small of my back and dizzy
feelings, besides having no energy for anything. One day my
attention was -called to Doan’s Backache Kidney Pills, and in
the hope that they might benefit me I got a bottle. After taking
them for a few days my health began to improve, and by the
time I had vised six bottles I was completely cured. I am
grateful to I"loan's Pills for the good they have done me, and
hope many ‘will profit by my experience and use this splendid
remedy. I never suffer with backuehe now, in fact, feel splendid
in every w ay.”
Six y»3ars later Mrs. Burrows says:—“l have had no reason
to alter rr y good opinion of Doan’s Backache Kidney Pills. They
cured! me some years ago, and I am still well.”
TESTIMONY
FROM
SYDNEY.
Mr. W. J. Frappell, who has been in the employ of Messrs.
Wright, Heaton and Co., Sydney, for nearly thirty years, says:
"It gives me pleasure to testify to the curative value of Doan's
Backache Kidney Pills. I had been suffering with an aching
back for a number of years, and at times it was very severe.
After trying many remedies without getting any ease whatever,
I was advised to take Doan's Backache Kidney Pills. I did so,
and from the first few doses got relief, and after using three
bottles I was entirely free of backache. lam thoroughly cured,
and hope this statement will meet the eye of other sufferers and
he the means of them getting relief through the use of Doan's
Backache Kidney Pills.”
Twenty-two years later Mr. Frappell says:—“I am still
a great believer in Doan’s Backache Kidney Pills. They cured
me many years ago, and I find by taking this remedy now and
then that I am able to keep free from the tortture of backache.”

in position. And, opposite her, Molly kept
pace with every movement.
“More tins!” shouted Liz, glancing down
(he room in Blake’s direction. “Make it
lively. I’m gettin’ cold !”
“More tins, please!" called somebody else.
Every girl turned quickly. There sat
Molly, smiling behind a stack of tins as
large as that which fronted Liz. With
studied unconcern she Avas smoothing out a
piece of tissue-paper preparatory to lining
a fresh container. She did not look up, so
she did not see the furious face that was
turned upon her from across the table. But
every girl in that room knew the significance
of her unruffled detachment. Blake, from
his position at the head of the passage,
watched the proceedings Avitli undisguised
satisfaction. It Avas a luxurious thought
that a continuation of this rivalry would be
decidedly beneficial to the firm's output. Also
it might conceivably result in more salary
for the foreman. x\ll was Avell with the
world, and Blake smiled contentedly.
Presently Liz rose from her chair, walked
deliberately around the table and faced her
rival.
“ ’Ow did it ’appen,” she demanded, “that
you go jes’ as fast as me, but no faster an’
no slower?”
“Why,” said Molly, Avitli a disarming
smile, “I knew in a minute that you were
the best packer in the room. I just tried
to keep up with you, that’s all. The work
is fairly hard here, and I wouldn’t like the
foreman to think badly of you, as he might
if I went any faster.”
“My Gawd !” Liz snapped out the Avords.
“Do I ’ear right, or am I deaf an’ dumb?
Are yer kiddin’ yerself that yer can go
quicker’n me? Can yer do better’ll Avhat
yer jes’ done?”
“Yes, I believe I can,” said Molly.
“Aav, can you?” screamed Liz, with bitter
scorn. “Well, ’ore's yer chance. Mr.
Blake’ll give us a check on a coupler dozen
tins, an’ we’ll see Avliat’s what. Get that
grin off yer face, an’ avc’ll settle this. Do yer
best, for I’m goin’ to give ycr an idea what
real packin’ is. When yer ready, Mr. Blake.”
When the foreman started them off Liz
bent to her work eagerly. She flattered her-
self that she knew Molly’s methods. Many
a time she had knoAvn new girls pack record
tins during their first morning, but they Avere
never able to maintain the same pace for
any length of time. This time Liz did not
bother to watch Molly. She wasn’t wasting
any time in looks. Slic’d show this new
arrival her right place in the universe! The
joyous prospect of her rival’s eclipse lent
speed to her flying fingers. She worked furi-
ously, her hands and brain co-ordinating
Avitli machine-like precision.
Liz reached out for the last tin. Like
lightning she threw the biscuits into posi-
tion and manipulated the pasteboard slabs.
A feeling of elation possessed her, for there
was not the slightest doubt in her mind that
she had won handsomely. Only two more
layers, the final paper-wrapping, and then. ..
“Done!” cried Molly.
Liz stopped working instantly, her hands
full of biscuits. A tier of full tins was on
the end of the neAV girl’s table; but to look
at Molly no one would have thought she had
been working any harder than usual.
Blake strolled down the passage; but Liz
Avas there first, scornful, vengeful, vindictive.
“Jes’ run through them tins,” she said
with ominous composure. “Somethin’ tells
me they ain’t packed proper.”
“That’s right, examine both lots of tins.”
For the first time that morning Molly showed
spirit. “If mine aren’t packed better than
hers, I’ll forfeit my day's pay.”
Blake ran through the tins rapidly.
“Well?” demanded Liz.
“0.K.,” was the ans Aver. “They're packed
even neater than the usual run. I reckon
you’ve met your match, Liz.”
‘'What!” screamed Liz, hurling the bis-
cuits to the. floor and making frantic efforts
to get her hands on her rival. "I knoAv Avlien
I’m beat, but that time ain’t yet.”
Blake stepped forward and ended the
argument. “Can’t have this sort of thing
going on in the shop,” he said with heavy
finality. “Liz, you’ll have to shift to the
other side of the room. I can't have you
two girls together if you can't get along
better.”
“Why pick me, then?” she snapped.
“I’m still in charge here,” Blake reminded
her. “This isn’t a debating club.”
Five minutes later the girls at the Water-
loo Biscuit Company bent over their tables
as if nothing had happened.
* * * *
Dancing Avas in full swing when Liz
checked her belongings at Professor Mellor’s
Select Academy in Botany-road that evening.
As she entered the room a close observer
might have detected faint traces of tears in
her eyes; but of repentance or sorrow there
was no sign. As she strutted across the
floor between dances nobody could help but
notice Liz. For one thing, her clothes would
not permit of indifference. And, on this
occasion, she Avas determined that there
should be no indifference.
“Is she here?” inquired Liz, stopping be-
fore a group of factory-girls and scanning
their faces for indications of loyalty or
treason.
Without speaking, one of the girls nodded
towards a corner where Molly sat surrounded
by a group of admiring youths.
A brief glance, and Liz returned to the
attack. “Can she dance?”
“She can,” replied a disloyal subject,
frankly. “An’ when she gits goin’, let me
tell yer it’s dancin'.”
“Bill Rafferty been here yet?” asked Liz.
“ ’E’s talkin’ with ’er now,” the same girl
ansAvered. “ ’E came early, an’, what’s more,
’e ’ad a coupler fox-trots with ’er. When
’e ’eard about the scrap between you an’ ’er
’e laughs an’ says: ‘Well, that ain’t nothin’
ter do with me. I ain’t mixiw in nothin’ like
that.’ ”
Liz squared her shoulders. “So ’e said
that, did ’e? Well, I ain’t the softest thing
in Waterloo, an’ I’ll show ’em both ’oav
things are.”
Turning from the group, she Avalked
straight across the room. Everybody saw
her, and at her approach all conversation
ceased except the one being carried on
between Molly Callaghan and Bill Rafferty.
At the edge of the inner circle Liz stopped,
hands on hips. Completely ignoring Molly,
she addressed Bill-
“ I’d like a word with yer if yer ain’t too
busy,” she said.
With a stammered apology Bill vacated
his chair and stumbled awkwardly through
the group.
“Don’t forget the last waltz,” Molly called
after him. But Bill didn't hear the injunc-
tion. Like a dog following its master, he
was trailing Liz to the other side of the
room.
“What d'ye want, Liz?” he asked as they
reached a window.
“ ’Erc’s the ring yer gave mo,” she snapped,
thrusting it into his hand, “an’ I’ll thank
yer t' ’and across the tiepin I give yer fer
Christmas. I ain’t scatterin’ no joolery
amongst two-faced fellers.”
“But”——— began Bill.
“Don't start lyin’. Yer danced with ’er,
didn’t yer, after kuowin’ ’ow things was be-
tween me an’ ’er? There ain't no more ter
be said. You’ve made yer choice; an’ once
I git that pin back, there ain't nothin’ be-
tween us.”
“Now, Liz” -
“That’s all! (Hood-bye, Mr. Rafferty!”
Just as Liz was returning to the group
of interested girls the next dance started;
and Bill Rafferty, walking disconsolately to
the door, demanded a pass-check and went
out into the open air to think things over.
Throughout the dance, Liz stood by the
window, and gazed down into the street. The
one heroic cavalier who was reckless enough
to ask her to dance was promptly sent about
his business. But before the next number
was called, Liz decided to enter into the
spirit of the evening with great zest. At
least it would be edifying to know that Bill
would probably be standing somewhere near
by and watching her smile into the eyes of
some of the other gallants. She would show
him how little she cared; and, at the
time, she would not favor him even to the
extent of a single glance. Yes, she would
got right into the middle of things.
Between dances she coquetted shamelessly,
entering into the general conversation with
an abandon that gave the impression that
this Avas a night of nights. And when the
orchestra struck up the opening bars of the
next piece, she modestly chose a vacant chair
to await the inevitable rush of partners.
When they came she would select Tom Pat-
terson, not because Tom was a good dancer,
but because Bill Rafferty disliked him most.
Also, there had been a time when Tom had
sought to bask in her smiles, but had been
denied that right by the forcible intervention
of Mr. Rafferty.
Liz waited. Once or tAviee she glanced
up shyly, and found nobody near her. Other
girls Avere claimed and swung out on to the
dancing-floor. Still, Liz possessed herself
in patience; but when the number was half-
way through the overwhelming fact burst
upon her that, for the first time in her life,
she was a wallflower. A wallflower! It
Avas just here that she discovered another
thing, equally humiliating. She realised that
she had lost her hold on the other girls.
Their actions showed her that more plainly
than any spoken words could have done. And
Bill Rafferty—lie was nowhere to be seen ;
even he had turned against her!
Within the next few moments Liz con-
templated revenge, murder —even suicide.
She hated the sight of the dancers, and the
music grated upon her. Another minute
found her at the cloak-room collecting her
belongings.
“Want a pass?” demanded the doorkeeper.
“I ain’t cornin’ back,” she told him. “The
crowd ’ere don’t seem ter suit. This place
is slippin’.”
Dejectedly walking out of the vestibule
on to the front steps, Liz paused there for
a few moments, and then made for the tram-
stop across the way. A lonely figure on the
tram seat took on a semblance of life at her
approach.
• LUo, Liz,” volunteered the figure.
Liz made no reply, though the look she
gave the figure was not altogether unfriendly.
"It don’t cost nothin’ ter be civil,” said
Rill Rafferty, untangling his legs and coming
towards her. “See ’ere,” he went on. “what's
crawlin’ on ycr, eh ? Sit ’ere a minnit an'
let’s git this thing right. What’s yer trouble
with that there Callaghan jane? I ’eard
about yer scrappin’ with ’er ’cause she ’ap
pened ter pack a bit quicker’n you. That
ain’t nothin’ ter fight over. What difference
does it make, any’ow?”
“The difference is that she ain’t goin’ ter
show me up, that’s all.”
“It don’t mean nothin’." He came closer.
“If yer got any sense left yer needn’t do
no more packin’, see? I got a full-time job
down at the brickworks yesterday—meant ter
tell yer before only yer never give me a
chance. Now, if yer take back this ’ere
ring, we can git married whenever yer say
the word. ’Ow about it?"
“Well, then” began Liz.
There was nobody about, so nobody saw.
“There’s jes’ time fer one dance before
they close,” said Bill a few moments later.
“Cornin’?”
When the music of the last waltz stopped
they found themselves near the corner where
Molly Calldglian still held court.
“Mr. Rafferty,” called the new girl, “you
ought to be ashamed of yourself. I’ve kept
that dance for you all night.
“You’ll ’ave to excuse me,” replied Bill
with a fine attempt at courtesy. “As it
happened, Miss ’Odges ’ere claimed me. And
as we’re gettin’ married in the mornin’ I
’ad no choice.”
“Married in the morning!” gasped the
chorus.
“Yes,” said Liz; “an’, Miss Callaghan,”
she went on with a toss of her head, “yer
can go yer ’ardest with the packin’—l’ve
done with it. It ain’t a lady’s job, fur as
I can see.”
“They’re playin' ‘ ’Ome, Sweet ‘Ome,’ ”
whispered Bill Rafferty in her ear.
“ ’Ome, Sweet ’Ome’!” echoed Liz dream-
ily. And yielding to his embrace she waltzed
slowly across to the door. A little knot of
factory-girls were in the vestibule as she
pushed past on Bill’s arm.
“My Gawd!- Wot’s ’appened ter Liz?”
asked one who had not heard the news.
“She’s that tame she’d eat out of yer ’and.”
