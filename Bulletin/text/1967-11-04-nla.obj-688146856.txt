Why the price
of the Bulletin
is now 25c
The Australian price of The Bulletin has
remained at 20c over a time when all
the costs of producing it have gone up,
when the service to readers has been
expanded, and when the price of most
other magazines has increased. To meet
these increased costs, this week the price
is increased to 25c.
We are sure you appreciate that The
Bulletin is the only magazine of its kind
that provides an understanding of what
is happening in our country and in the
countries around us and that looks at the
world from an Australian viewpoint. You
may not agree with everything in The
Bulletin, but we are sure you appreciate
its value.
And how
you can still
get the Bulletin at
the old price of 20c
To keep faith with regular
Australian readers we now
announce a special concession offer
in which you can continue to pay
only the old price of 20c for The
Bulletin. Under this special offer
Australian readers can take out a
12 months’ subscription to The
Bulletin for $10.40. This repre-
sents a saving on the new price
of $2.60. This offer is available to
Australian readers only.

BATMAN’S
MELBOURNE
PMG knocks
the mystique
out of S.E.2
FOR POLITE MELBURNIANS it
has always been terribly important to
live in Toorak. Oh, yes, Kew is good,
North Balwyn is good, Beaumaris is
good, you can even get by in parts of
Brighton, but finally and desirably,
Toorak has always been the greatest.
It has no equivalent in Australia. Get-
ting into Toorak has always been like
getting into a good club. One has one’s
Rolls or Daimler, one’s Toorak man-
sion and one’s country seat at Portsea.
The essential Toorak was always be-
tween Grange and Glenferrie Roads,
preferably in St. Georges Road, Albany
Road, or Heyington Place.
Dear Reader, it is time that some-
body admitted the ugly truth. Toorak
is slipping. There is hardly one decent,
large estate left. Nareeb has been sub-
divided, mostly into the very latest
Georgian-castironiana, Whelan the
Wrecker has pulled down the vast neo-
Tudor Knox mansion in St. Georges
Road, ballroom and all. The sub-
dividers have moved in. This has meant
the ultimate ruin of St. Georges Road.
After all, it was never quite the same
after (a) it became a virtual exten-
sion of the South Eastern Freeway and
(b) Mr. Holt became Prime Minister.
These times people are always demon-
strating outside his house, which is not
good for the tone of the street.
Then, in Toorak Road, the second
horrid towering block of apartments is
now complete. These apartments, Own
Your Owns or whatever, look down on
St. John’s Toorak, where for a century
the most financially pure names in
Australia have been coupled. Indeed,
there are now so many OYO’s in
Toorak Road, the magic postal numbers
5.E.2 don’t mean anything any more.
Anybody can get into the club now.
And that’s another thing, 5.E.2, of
course, is 3142. And what can you do
with 3142. The gracious suburb has
been torpedoed by the PMG. Frankly,
no matter how the residents put 3142
on their letterheads, no matter how
beautiful the script, it will never regain
the mystique of 5.E.2.
If Toorak is to become a suburb of
cliff-dwellers, then it doesn’t have any
advantage over 3141, alias South Yarra.
After all, 3141 has just as many Rolls-
Royces and Daimlers, and just as many
grand names. Sir Norman and Dame
Mabel Brookes live in South Yarra.
You may remember that LBJ visited
Dame Mabel in South Yarra. It was
in 3141 that he had paint thrown over
his car. He missed out entirely on any
3142 paint.
Actually, your correspondent would
like to put forward the idea that South
Yarra is now, easily, the swingingest,
most “with it” little area in Melbourne.
For years South Yarra and Toorak,
commercially, have looked sideways at
each other, but now South Yarra is way
ahead.
It has gone completely for the Vic-
torian-Edwardian cast-iron bit. Toorak
really started the olde worlde business.
It tried to kid Melbourne that it was
a typical, little Rolls-Royce-ridden
English village. It was called “Toorak
Village,” and for a time it went aggres-
sively neo-Tudor. Now South Yarra has
gone aggressively mid-Victorian, neo-
East Melbourne. It has more iron lace-
work and many more coach lamps to
the square mile than 5.E.2. It definitely
has more cast-iron columns, more olde
English fronts, and its Continental deli-
catessens outwurst the Continental
delicatessens of Toorak.
If you are running a boutique in
South Yarra, here’s some advice. Get
yourself a cast-iron stove a la “Satur-
day Evening Post,” a huge old pair of
balance scales for the counter, a vint-
age cash register designed by Ronald
Searle, old Edison cylinder records to
scatter around the window, aspidistras
all over the place, the string hanging
from the ceiling ye olde ironmonger
style, and cover the walls with Aubrey
Beardsley prints. You’ve gotta be as
fin de siecle as you can get.
South Yarra gains its strength be-
cause it is the most densely populated
pocket of Melbourne. It is also part of
Prahran, which is capital of the Greek
community. It is also, as one dis-
“Indeed! No doubt they used a
Presbyterian computer!”
tinguished resident told me, “the fairy
capital of the Southern Hemisphere.”
One felt that this was a bold claim,
but he said: “I was drinking at a place
the other night, looked over my shoul-
der and, good grief, the fellow next to
me was wearing false eyelashes. What’s
more, the place was full of them.”
Let’s look over 3141. It has five art
galleries, the South Yarra, Gallery A,
the Toorak (which is not in Toorak),
the Blue Boy, and Howard’s Print Gal-
lery. It is very nearly the most con-
centrated centre for good restaurants in
town. There’s Antonio’s, Maxim’s,
L’Escargot, Cafe Edouard, Three Faces,
just to mention a few. Oh, and of
course, there’s the Pickwick. This, too,
is aggressively olde worlde with lead-
lighted windows, wrought-iron, cast-
iron, cedar panelling, and such correct
detail as terribly bad 19th-century oil
paintings.
There are at least six first-class furni-
ture stores, both modern and antique.
What’s more, top fashion people, top
milliners, like Norma Tullo and Nanc
Bannon are in South Yarra.
The best time to see 3141 or 3142 is
on Saturday mofning. They are very
different. In Toorak the ladies wear
damned good cashmere, mohair and
camel hair. They wear superbly cut
slack-suits, beautiful tweeds, and mink
is even seen. One just doesn’t wear
anything in Toorak on Saturday morn-
ing.
South Yarra is more corduroy, black
stocking, more long - booted, with
scraggy Morticia hairdos both for male
and female.
After touring the art galleries, where
one might pick up an Arthur Boyd for
as little as $lOOO, the best place to go
is the Flea Market. This is an old
house at the back of the Regent
Theatre, a two-storey place, rather like
Miss Haversham’s in “Great Expecta-
tions.”
Every little square inch and corner
is let out to tenants, and on Saturday
mornings they are all flogging stuff.
You have to literally fight your way
through the crowd of tight pants. One
can pick up all those things one des-
perately needs, like brass aspidistra
hippybowls, candle snuffers, lorgnettes
no end, hippy dinner jackets (circa
1905), military jackets for wearing
when protesting against military, Ned
Kelly reward-notice prints, and the
very newest in protest buttons and
posters.
The Flea Market also has atmos-
phere. It stinks with it. At every stall
they are burning incense.
Oh yes, in South Yarra there are
poodle shops, fashion shops, boutiques
with cutey-pie names like “Sugar
Plum” and “Etcetera.” You can pick up
nice Corinthian columns for the garden,,
price $24 each.
Then, recently, on a Saturday morn-
ing I noted a shop that was selling'
scarlet striped mini-skirts. Dear Read-
ers, they were made from Scotch Col-
lege blazers.
And that is something that could
never happen in 3142.

Come up and
defer to me
some time
BY ROSS CAMPBELL
WALTER GRAEBNER, an American
magazine writer, was a friend of
Churchill in his later years. Like every-
one else who knew Churchill, Graebner
wrote a book about him. It was quite
a good one, and in the course of it he
made a statement that has haunted me
ever since. He said: “Churchill did not
go to see anybody; people always went
to see him.”
It conveyed the eminence of Churchill
in a most impressive way. It was par-
ticularly impressive to me, because,
being a journalist, I have so often had
to go and see people. The situation
in which everyone, as a matter of
course, would come to see me consti-
tutes a wild Walter Mitty dream of
greatness.
The right to have people come to see
you is one of the most potent attri-
butes of superior status. In fact, the
human race could be classified accord-
ing to the degree in which various
members possess it. At the bottom of
the hierarchy are lowly beings such as
office boys, who have to jump to it
when somebody presses a button. At
the dizzy summit are a few individuals,
such as the Pope, whom nobody at all
can ask to drop in and see them. The
rest of us occupy positions somewhere
in between.
Let us call this variable attribute the
Right of Audience Giving or RAG.
There is no problem in the relationship
of two people of obviously different
RAG, such as a managing director and
his factory superintendent. The factory
superintendent goes to see the manag-
ing director. But there are many other
situations where two persons have prac-
tically the same RAG. The tricky ques-
tion then arises: who should go to see
whom ?
That is what happened, at the top
level, when Mr. Kosygin was in New
York visiting the United Nations. Both
Mr. Kosygin and President Johnson
have a maximum rating in the RAG
scale, so neither could go to see the
other without losing face. In order to
meet they had to find a suitable no-
man’s land or Tom Tiddler’s ground.
Accordingly they proceeded to a place
between Washington and New York,
the • obscure town of Glassboro, in the
B-grade State of New Jersey.
On a smaller scale, a similar kind
of impasse is common in the business
world. A typical situation developed at
a big engineering firm, the Amalga-
mated Rotary Muffler Co. The produc-
tion manager, Mr. Chudley, and the
sales manager, Mr. Bingwell, had
exactly the same RAG.
One morning Mr. Chudley rang Mr.
Bingwell and said: “Is that you, Ted?
I’d be glad if you’d step round to my
office and have a look at the designs
for our new Type 118 muffler the
one with the retroactive flange.”
Mr. Bingwell stalled. “I’m tied up
just now, Les,” he said, sipping his
morning tea. “Do you mind if we talk
about it later on?”
At three o’clock he rang Mr. Chud-
ley and said: “Les, I’ve got Mr. Grum-
bell of Neptune Marine Pumps here in
my office. I wonder if you’d mind
bringing round the designs of the Type
118 muffler; he’d like to see them.”
Mr. Chudley was not to be trapped as
easily as that. “Sorry, Ted,” he said,
fingering the designs, “but the designs
are out in the gasket division at the
moment. Would you tell Mr. Grumbell
I’ll have them in my office* tomorrow?”
Their sparring went on like this for
a week. Then old Mr. McFlint, the
managing director, said to Mr. Bing-
well: “Have you and Les Chudley
worked out a sales approach for the
new retroactive flange muffler yet?”
Mr. Bingwell said: “Not completely,
sir. I was going to suggest we have a
conference on it with you this after-
noon.” As so often happens, an office
conference provided the rival executives
with their Glassboro.
Actually neither Mr. Chudley nor
Mr. Bingwell has ever been inside the
other’s office, though they take care to
have identical floor coverings.
On a slightly higher plane, Mr. Mc-
Flint of Amalgamated Rotary Muffler
has never entered the office of Mr.
Weldall, head of Universal Eccentric
Cams Pty. Ltd. To get together on pre-
paring a case for the Tariff Board, they
met in the Royal Commonwealth Golf
Club. That is a vital function of clubs
and pubs they provide the Tom
Tiddler’s grounds where persons of
equal RAG can mingle without pain.
My telephone just rang, and a voice
said: “The Editor-in-Chief would like
to see you.” For a moment I felt a
mad Churchillian impulse to say: “Tell
him to step around.” But I am no
Churchill; I shall go.

They don't all
learn it
in a hurry
By DAPHNE GUINNESS
SIX P.M. at Arthur Murray’s, pressed
between the back entrances of Banks
Commonwealth and Wales Savings in
Wynyard Lane, Sydney. “How’re you
getting on, Mr. Foster?” asks the
receptionist upstairs with a great, gay
twinkling laugh. Mr. Foster’s eyes
whirl behind his horn-rimmed spec-
tacles. Wonderful! Marvellous! But
er he has a few doubts, he’s not
quite—Laughter all round. Impossible.
Arthur Murray’s guarantee success.
What comes in like a flat-footed ele-
phant simply has to leave like a twinkle-
toed Nureyev.
Supervisor Chris Gatacre, 26, a curvy
all-in-black girl, sits in a dim office and
says this is the point of Arthur Mur-
ray’s. Sixty dollars sounds a lot for ten-
half-hour lessons; what people don’t
realise is they get group lessons thrown
in, six parties a year, including trips to
nightclubs to get the feel of dancing
in public, and surprise parties not
knowing where they’re going; last
year they ended up on the ferry, this
year aha no telling, but they’ll
love it, and if they can’t dance after all
this they get free lessons till they do.
One man had 20. The trouble with
him, Miss Gatacre lowers her Cleopatra
eyes, he just fooled around at the others.
Actually, most people come for social
dancing all kinds, from 15 to any
age; they once had a 90-year-old lady
and they join the Fun Club. They
get a lovely response. Serious dancers
graduate from Bronze to Silver to Gold
to Gold Bar to Gold Star and finally get
Diamond Pins. There aren’t many of
those.
Miss Gatacre loves her job. It’s being
with people that makes it interesting.
She got it during a stint in America
with her father, Admiral Galfrey Gat-
acre, then Chief of Joint Staff and mad
about cha-cha and stomp. (Her mother
is a Gold Medallist and comes in for
lessons.) A secretary, she was nothing
more than a machine, really. Miss
Gatacre could write the letters better
than the people who dictated them. And
there was this advertisement saying
Teachers Wanted. They never thought
she would get through the training, she
was hopeless. But, well, she did, and
here she is supervising 130 members,
judging the exams., working for an
amazing manager what Mike
Marco has done for Australia, introduc-
ing Dancerama for one thing and
one day, who knows, she may be a
manager herself.
Outside, music thumps away and
Miss Gatacre says let’s get Miss Moran
in to explain The Plan. Miss Moran,
ex-ballet, ex-stage, enters in prim
frilled dress, opens a cream-colored
examination-looking document, and be-
gins 15 minutes of complicated dance
jargon. She takes a deep breath and
adds in plain English: “The foxtrot
has something for everyone. The waltz
is very slow. The tango is very magic.
What do you say about the tango, Miss
Gatacre?” Miss Gatacre says it sends
shivers up her spine, grrrrrr-woooof,
and brings out the aggressiveness in
men. With The Plan everyone in Arthur
Murray’s 500 branches knows where he
is and what progress he is making.
A student can be halfway through his
Swing Basic Thow-Out in, say,
America and can carry on with his
Sugar-Push, Tuck-In (or optional Open
Tuck-In) in, say, London. There’s a
couple here now who left mid-Plan
in Oregon, and a soldier brushing up
his beat on a five-day leave from
Vietnam.
The studio is filling up with assorted
ages and sizes. One female teacher
shows a middle-aged man a sexy move
of the hips, followed by a swift parry
of the pelvis “ah, that’s Mr. X; he’s
here for social reasons” and on the
other side is Mr. Ross Gardner, who
packages things in the docks and is
something of a feather in Miss Gat-
acre’s cap. A year ago he was the result
of an Arthur Murray telephone call.
A year later he was an Arthur Murray,
festival winner. A world trip, they said:
how about that? Mr. Gardner nearly
passed out. He is still terribly shy off
the floor, but a demon on it. The only
trouble is when he couldn’t dance every-
one else seemed so good. Now he can
dance they’re all so awful.
Like a man possessed, Mr. Gardner
throws himself into a series of cross-
overs and passes, reverse spins into
sailor shuffles and boogies, continues
with a bit of Tango Rocks Turning
with syncopated cross-back shine, and
Miss Gatacre says what about looking
at the beginners upstairs? One man
here looks set for 40 free lessons.
Actually, there is a bit of a lull in
the dance world at the moment. The
last frantic thing that happened was
Go-Go, but that’s a trifle passe now.
So, too, is country dancing, Scottish
reels, and all that. What the next rage
will be is anybody’s guess excepting
Miss Gatacre’s. Her orders have not
arrived from HQ in America. Mean-
while, students of the ballroom can
proceed confidently with close dancing.
On the way out, Miss Gatacre says
that that picture of Arthur Murray on
the wall is a rare one. You don’t often
see him smiling.

What did Melbourne's
biggest office building
say to Alcoa aluminium?
“Colour me Duranodic”
The A.M.P. Society’s St. James project,
now under construction in Melbourne,
represents the first massive order for
Alcoa’s newly-introduced Duranodic 300
permanent colour finish for aluminium.
The architects were looking for two
qualities in the material to be used for
doors, windows,entrances,shop fronts, etc.
1. Optimum resistance to weathering
and wear.
2. An attractive bronze colour.
Alcoa Duranodic provided the ideal
answer.
Throughout the world, Duranodic 300
finishes are defying extremes of climate
and hard wear. Duranodic 300 finishes
permeate the metal’s structure to give
in-depth colour. They provide a richer,
harder finish which is colourfast,
permanent and more lustrous in colour.
They are a product of Alcoa research
specially developed for architectural
exterior and interior surfaces where wear
is excessive and maintenance is difficult.
The selection of Alcoa Duranodic,
immediately following its introduction,
for Melbourne’s biggest office building is
a quick and striking testimonial to its
superior qualities.
Duranodic 300 medium bronze is but one
of the permanent colour finishes available
for aluminium from Alcoa of Australia.

McCutcheon. Consulting Architects: Skidmore,

THE ROCKS
ONCE such a centre of Pacific Ocean toughness that it exported gangs
to terrorise San Francisco, as well as Sydney, the Rocks area is now
passing through the twilight of its long history, waiting to be
planned out of existence. Part of it was chopped away in the early
1930 s to make room for the Harbor Bridge. Most of the rest of it is
now planned to go, with remnants to be left here and there, like echoes.

ONE MORE
WEEK
Any farmers around?
“I HOPE THERE ARE no farmers in
the audience!” said Trade Minister John
McEwen when opening the Australian
Textile Council’s Fabrics of the Year
award in Sydney last week. And well he
might, for there he was, the Leader of
the Country Party, lavishing praise on
the products and management of an
industry that, despite the furious oppo-
sition of most farmers, has been heavily
tariff protected as a result of his policies.
And to make matters worse, only one
of the six Logos he presented for the
best fabric of the year went to a pro-
duct made from Australian wool.
Brontosauri in a Sydney park
“The Flintstones slide down the neck
of the brontosaurus, then through the
body, and wind up in the tail, and you
see some of it live and some of it on
film on the stage.” This surrealist
sentence was delivered smilingly by
Tibor Rudas, whose extraordinary stage
show, based on the celebrated comic
strip, promises to be, if we are allowed
to wax enthusiastic for a moment, the
most far-out entertainment ever to be
seen in Sydney. And this week, if plans
are not disrupted at the last minute,
Sydney’s Centennial Park is witness
to cane brontosauri, made in Hong
Kong, being made by clockwork to
flump about through the trees, while the
cast, in fibreglass false heads, tangle
with these creatures for a film directed
by Rudas himself.
If all this sounds strange, it’s only
one aspect of the extraordinary career
of Rudas, far and away Australia’s
most remarkable showman, whose 73
famous Rudas girls perform all over
the world: held over at the Lido in
Paris for longer than any other team
in its history, doing very well in Tokyo,
Milan, Las Vegas, and London. With
only six people on his Sydney staff, two
in Las Vegas, two in Paris, and asso-
ciates in Hong Kong and Milan, Rudas
manages to be a world-wide entre-
preneur, whose combination of live
action and film in the same show-—-
figures dancing out of the screen on to
the stage and back again in an effect
of startling beauty as seen at the Tropi-
cana in Las Vegas—is a rare Australian
first.
Rudas got the idea, he told me,
from an advertisement for toothbrushes
he saw six years ago in Grand Central
Station; the advertisement was filmed,
and suddenly broke down, the mech-
anism at the back cracking up and a
metal arm bursting through the screen.
After months of trial and error, he
finally talked the bosses of the Tropi-
cana in Las Vegas into letting him
create a screen made of elastic strips,
stretched tight between steel uprights,
30 feet wide and 22 feet tall, through
which dancers could hurl themselves;
then he plucked up the courage to
hire a sound stage at MGM, spend two
months reading up everything about
film-making (he thought a camera
dolly was a pretty girl), and arrived in
the midst of a battery of cameras, lights,
and wires to shoot a story of an apache
love affair, with the dancers hurtling
in and *out of their own photographed
actions.
Everyone in Hollywood thought
Rudas was mad, but Walt Disney
encouraged him. His greatest achieve-
ment —after years of successful shows
of this kind at Las Vegas, with a whole
succession of live-and-filmed creations—
was at the Montreal Expo, where he
worked with Leon Leonidoff, produc-
tion genius of Radio City Music Hall.
Rudas is even more agog about “The
Flintstones,” due for either the Tivoli
or Her Majesty’s at Christmas and star-
ring Peita Toppano, daughter of the
celebrated team of Peggy Mortimer and
Enzo Toppano. This will be staged on
three huge screens, and will show bron-
tosauri belching filmed and real flames,
and the family devoured by the
monster, among many other effects cal-
culated to delight any healthy child.
Colors from the pot
THE WORD psychedelic has been ban-
died about so much that very few
swingers have lived long enough to
remember the days three or four years
ago when the word was coined.
It used to mean something about
sensations created with light and sound,
simulating the effect upon the mind of
a hefty dose of a drug such as LSD.
Nowadays, the word can mean any-
thing you like so long as it’s brightly
colored and preferably gives you a
headache if you stare at it too long,
and so long as it’s got nothing to do
with drugs.
At the Sydney Cove Shop in Gold-
fields House, near Circular Quay, in
Sydney, David Letts, co-owner of the
shop with Hugh McGowan, attempted
to sort out for us the true psychedelia
from the currently fashionable
Edwardian paraphernalia,
Pie classified his posters of Moby
Grape, Jack the Ripper, and Big
Brother, imported from Portal Publica-
tions, U.S.A., as “psychedelic, cer-
tainly.”
“And our wall-hangings, lantern
lamps, cushion covers from London,
an d match covers. But then, again,
maybe the matches aren’t—they say
things like Mrs. Jones actually eats
butter, they’re really Sydney fashions,”
he said.
David decided that most of all, the

COMMENT
How not to sound
like American stooges
BY
“OBSERVER”
IMAGINE THAT Mr. Harold Holt
is the Prime Minister of the nation of
Sydney. The rest of Australia is cut
up into a number of other nations, none
of them run by people of British des-
cent, although there are commercially
important pockets of British in most
of them, some of whom are being perse-
cuted and against all of whom there
is distrust. And imagine that the Viet-
nam war is going on in Tasmania.
Concerned about the future of his
nation, Mr. Holt goes over to the
United States and he tells the Ameri-
cans that he is looking them over to
find out if they have the guts to perse-
vere in the Vietnam war. He has no
illusions about that war. He recognises
that a sudden American pull-out could
put his nation through the communist
mincing machine of terrorism, subver-
sion, and guerilla insurrection. And
although he doesn’t want the Americans
to stay for ever propping up South-East
Asia in perpetuity, he nevertheless
wants a chance for his nation and others
like it to exist without the threat of
subversion or invasion.
Does Mr. Holt say to the Americans,
as his Treasurer did recently: “Where
you will go, we will go, too”? Or does
he say: “I want to know if your com-
mitment is to the end of the world with
me? We won’t throw in our lot with
you unless we know the answer to this
question. American defeat in Vietnam
is not possible, but American weariness
and disgust is possible, particularly on
the civilian home front, where it is most
likely to happen, and that’s the reason I
am here. I suggest to you that, having-
gone this far this long, if you haven’t
got the guts to see this through, well,
you’re not a credible force.”
In other words, imagine that Sydney
was Singapore, and that Mr. Holt was
Singapore’s Prime Minister, Lee Kuan
Yew, and that he spoke to the Ameri-
cans as Mr. Lee did last week.
What is it that makes it unlikely that
our own Ministers will speak in
America as frankly as Mr. Lee? There
is one obvious reason, and that is that
we are not being wooed, as Mr. Lee is
being: we have been won, and in a
manner that is no disgrace to us. As
long ago as 1942, when the British
showed that they could not hold their
own in South-East Asia, Australia
turned, in its pragmatism, to the Ameri-
cans. But, given this, why do we feel
bound to talk like stooges, when we
are not?
There are probably two main reasons.
The first of these is that we got into
this habit of using sycophantic language
in our relationship with the British. In
the period when our older politicians
formed their views of the world our
relation with Britain was not openly
expressed as a national union of mutual
self interest, but primarily as one of
loyalty. The real tests were of loyalty
to the Imperial Idea and of gratitude
for being British. The polite thing to
say when a Minister went to London
was to express unswerving loyalty to the
Throne, to Britishry and to the Em-
pire. He did not say: “Look, we’re in
this thing together, mates, let’s make
as good a job of it as we can.” Instead
he paid homage to our common British
traditions and assured the British that
we would be there when the whips were
cracking.
This tradition has now been trans-
fei'red to America. When they go there
our Ministers have to say something.
What the American administration most
wants them to say is that we will put
up some more troops. Bit by bit, with
the Americans prodding, we meet this
request. But in their public perfor-
mances our Ministers seem to feel
bound to pop up with old platitudes, as
if the Americans were the British and
they wanted endless shots of loyalty.
(In fact, an Australian did once say:
“Where the Empire goes, Australia goes,
too.”)
The second reason for our occasional
appearance of obsequiousness is that
our governments have been privately
playing the role of urgers. We privately
urged the Americans to go bigger into
Vietnam in the first place and we con-
tinue to urge them to stay there, but
we also continue to urge them to do
more than we are doing ourselves.
Recognising that we had to put up or
shut up, we increased the percentage of
our GNP we spent on defence from its
disgracefully low level to a more re-
spectable five percent, but we now seem
to consider that this figure is sacred.
The figure was picked out of the hat
in the first place, as something likely
to satisfy the Americans: it was chosen
before we knew how we were going to
spend it. But the fact that we are now
spending it doesn’t mean that we are
using our brains to get the best value
out of that five percent; nor does it yet
match the American figure. Given the
fact that we are not getting full value
out of our five percent and that we are
spending less than the Americans, any-
way, even if our Ministers wanted to
speak up, even if they had something
to say, they might not be game to.
They would be afraid that the Ameri-
cans might come back with a quick
“Well, look who’s talking.”
The Government does not yet act as
if it realises the significance for Aus-
tralia of the new mood in America.
This new mood was accurately reflected
by Mr. Richard Nixon in his article in
a recent Bulletin when he said: “If
another friendly country should be
faced with an externally supported
communist insurrection . . . tß’ere is
serious question whether the American
public or the American Congress would
now support a unilateral American
intervention, even at the request of the
host Government. This makes it vitally
in their own interest that the nations
in the path of China’s ambitions move
quickly to establish an indigenous Asian
framework for their own future security
. . . The role of the United States as
world policeman is likely to be limited
in the future.”
The realistic approach for Australia
toward the Americans in their new
mood is to show that it can take some
strong independent initiative of its own.
Australia’s policy should be the build-
ing up of an Oceanic Alliance of
Malaysia, Singapore, Indonesia, the
Philippines, Australia, and New Zeal-
and, based on a mutual security pact,
on economic co-operation schemes, and
on a program of social and cultural
interchange. We should remember that in
this area our GNP is greater than that
of the other five nations combined. In
comparative economic terms we are a
big power. We should use that power,
in economic and military strength, to
encourage a situation in which it is
obvious that here is at least one region
in the world that is prepared to try to-
do something for itself. Instead of lag-
ging behind others in economic assist-
ance, we should take the lead, or share
it with Japan, and then send our Prime
Minister off to the former colonial
powers to lecture them that they should
come in more strongly with economic
assistance, too. Then our Prime Minister
could go to Washington and, instead
of merely expressing loyalty, he could
urge the American people to continue
to give South-East Asian countries a
chance to settle their own affairs by
continuing the struggle in Vietnam,
and he could add credibility to his plea
by saying that the independent regional
arrangements now made in the area
make it a good bet.
A sometimes stupefyingly narrow
self-interest is one Australian charac-
teristic: but a broad generosity of spirit,
an innocent goodwill, is another. We
should bring the latter characteristic
more into play. Sometimes we seem
to see the people of South-East Asia
merely as a row of minor pieces protect-
ing our own back row. We should make
it clear that we see them as brothers,
with a right to the stability and pros-
perity we ourselves enjoy; when we
speak to the Americans we should speak
up not for ourselves, but for our neigh-
bors. There can even be self-interest in
this. The world doesn’t owe Australia
its prosperity or even its existence; we
have made little impact on the world’s
imagination. We have produced no
great art or great literature or signifi-
cant body of intellectual thought to
draw attention to ourselves. But there
still exists, beneath the shabbiness of
our lingering provincialism, a great
belief in brotherhood. This is a belief
that we should now project beyond
our own shores.


How about it, all you
Collins St. farmers?
BY
MICHAEL
BAUME
IT IS REMARKABLE that so few
Australians invest in farming. Every-
one is prepared to have a go at the
stockmarket and put their money in
industrial companies that return as
little as three percent, but very few
ever think of farming as an invest-
ment. Despite the jibes, there are rela-
tively few Pitt or Collins Street farm-
ers. There ought to be more of them.
The only way the ordinary investor
gets a stake in agriculture is through
the couple of pastoral companies that
are on the Stock Exchange lists or
through the big companies like British
Tobacco and the L. J. Hooker Invest-
ment Corporation that have diversified
their activities into farming. But farm-
ing can be a good investment; Ameri-
can investors are pouring millions of
dollars into Australian agriculture while
Australians are spending their time
playing the mining market. It is true
that many of the big developments the
Americans are financing are too large
(or in some instances too speculative)
for the average local, investor. Yet
there is so much development that could
be done so profitably by local investors
without running huge risks and
which would be very much in the
national interest that the lack of
enthusiasm for doing so is striking.
Not even the good examples set by
the AMP Society in moving so strongly
(and so successfully) into pastoral de-
velopment has done anything to stimu-
late other institutional investors to fol-
low suit. And there are massive govern-
mental incentives through tax conces-
sions that make investing in the land a
more worthwhile proposition for many
people than buying a bundle of shares.
For the realities of farming are that
it is not only a way of life; it can also
be an efficient, money-making industry.
There is a mystique about the land
that tends to breed inefficiency; the
application of modern business tech-
niques and agricultural practices to
large areas of Australia would bring
massive increases in agricultural pro-
ductivity, to farm incomes and to the
balance of payments. Not even the
drought has really knocked the gloss
off farming’s real attractions for in-
vestors, particularly those whose incomes
are large enough to take full advantage
of the tax concessions allowed by the
Government in its eagerness to see
more capital invested in agricultural
development. For the cash benefits in
tax savings that come from spending
money on improving a pastoral property
are very significant. Then there is the
prospect of earning a pretty good re-
turn on the investment, as well. Broadly
speaking, primary producers can claim
a deduction for almost any expenditure
that will bring land into production
or improve the productive qualities of
land already in use. The people this
sort of thing helps most are those whose
incomes are so high that they are pay-
ing out two-thirds in tax.
One farm management company
demonstrates just how big these savings
can be by pointing out that if a pro-
fessional man has a regular taxable
income of $20,000 per annum, his
annual payment for taxation would be
$9235. If, instead of paying all that
tax, he chose to spend $lO,OOO a year
on deductible items relating to his
property, his annual tax payable would
be reduced to $3402 —a saving of almost
$6OOO per year. Over three years the
investor would have spent $30,000 on
deductible items on his farm and saved
$lB,OOO in tax. If his investment had
been prudent, not only would be have
converted $30,000 of income into at
least $30,000 of capital but he would
also have received a tax-free refund of
$18,090, which is a handsome return
on the money invested. And where a
taxpayer is on a steadily increasing
income and faces provisional tax the
moneys saved on tax outlays are even
more striking.
The Taxation Department itself goes
to some pains to demonstrate the tax-
saving advantages of rural investment.
In an official booklet it says: “If you
(as a primary producer) buy 1000 acres
of virgin land for $lO an acre and spend
$5O an acre in clearing, grassing, and
erection of a rabbit-proof fence, etc., you
would be granted a deduction of the
$50,000 spent in improving the land. The
value of the deduction, in terms of tax
saved, would depend on your rate ol
tax. Suppose, for example, that your
taxable income is such that you pay
tax at 67 cents in the $1 on extra in-
come. Thus you save 67 cents in the $1
on deductions claimed and save, in this
case, $33,334. The net cost, to you, of
the improved land would be $60,000
less $33,334, namely $16,666. If you
sold it for only what it cost you, i.e.,
$60,000, no part of your net gain of
$33,334 would be taxable. If you sell
it for more than $60,000, again no tax
is payable on any part of the proceeds
unless of course you had acquired the
land as part of the profit-making plan.
“Taxpayers engaged in a business
other than primary production, who
develop capital assets with the chance
of a capital profit as the aim, are not
generally granted deductions from
current income of the amount spent
in developing that asset. But you, as a
primary producer, are granted these
deductions for the purpose of making
it more profitable to you to develop
the rural potential of this country.”
But is the taxation concession enough
to encourage this to happen? “Given
expert advice and management, returns
from investment in rural property in
terms of both income and capital gain
can be at least as predictable and satis-
factory as can be expected from any
other sound business enterprise,”
according to a farm management group
that is now trying to encourage invest-
ment in farming as a business, on the
absentee-landlord basis, rather than as
a way of life.
It is to provide this sort of expertise
that Rural Management Pty. Ltd.,
formed by two solicitors and two farm
management consultants, began busi-
ness last month. This sort of farm
management service means that an
investor need take no more role in the
management of his property than he
would in the management of an indus-
trial company in which he had shares.
But while it is all very well for com-
panies, or very rich investors, to buy
their way into the farming business and
hire experts to advise them and manage
their properties, this sort of thing is
beyond the reach of most private
investors. The only way they could take
up a stake in the pastoral business
would be by joining up with a few
others to provide the cash. For a
property must be big enough to be
worthwhile. A year or so ago a group
of Sydney professional men (two solici-
tors, a chartered accountant, a company
director, and a stockbroker) joined
with a grazier in forming a company
aimed at doing exactly that. This com-
pany, Agris Ltd., has already set up
three syndicates with properties that are
now being developed, another is almost
ready to commence and another two
are being formed. So far, doctors and
stockbrokers have made up two-thirds
of the Agris syndicate members.
The Agris idea is to get five, six, or
seven people with similar tax problems
together into a syndicate and contribut-
ing something like $6OOO a year toward
the capital improvements to be made
to the property. The special appeal
of Agris is that the syndicate does not
have to put up any money to buy the
property in the first place; it is sold
on terms by the owner. And because
of the considerably increased value of
the property that follows a couple of
years of intensive improvements, it is
easy enough to mortgage the property
for at least as much as it originally
cost in order to pay off the vendor
(who, by the way, gets 8 percent while
he is waiting).
Of course these services cost money.
Agris gets running costs plus 20 per-
cent of net profits from operations or
20 percent of any capital profit on
sale; Rural Management charges a pro-
fessionel fee based on time spent. Both
these companies were registered at the
same Sydney address 187 Macquarie
Street. But they are unrelated! Agris’s
chairman, solicitor G. P. Bogard, is a
partner in Freehill Hoilingdale and
Page, which has offices at that address,
while Rural Management’s David
Landa has his firm of solicitors on an-
other floor of the same building.

Harold Holt’s
lucky week
BY
ALAN
REID
PRIME MINISTER Harold Holt
must have breathed a sigh of relief
last week. Treasurer William Mc-
Mahon held out to Trade Minister
Jack McEwen an olive branch so large
that it consisted of half a tree, and, in
the Senate, Holt’s new leader, John
Gorton, handled the VIP flights issue
in such a fashion as to get Holt out
of real parliamentary trouble.
Probably from Holt’s viewpoint the
more important move, long-term, was
McMahon’s quite obvious search for
peace with McEwen.
The tension between these two men
has undoubtedly been a factor in pois-
oning Liberal-Country Party relation-
ships over recent months. For quite
a period now, McEwen, these days pos-
sibly the most capable operator on the
Government’s side of politics, has filled
almost a neutral role. He has been so
preoccupied in defending Country
Party interests that he has virtually
ceased to defend the Government as
a whole. The Government has lacked
his positive support and on the nega-
tive side has seen quite deep suspicions
develop between the Liberal and Coun-
try Party partners in the Coalition Ad-
ministration.
McEwen has undoubtedly suspected
a liaison between McMahon and the
Basic Industries Group, which is out
to destroy the Country Party and des-
troy McEwen’s influence, particularly
in the field of tariff making. McMahon
has denied that there are any grounds
for the suspicion and is known to have
subjected himself to cross-examination
by Holt on the subject so that Holt
could be assured that there was no con-
nection between the Group and his
Treasurer and Deputy Leader.
In fairness to McMahon, it must be
stated that no proof of any connection
has ever been produced to justify the
suspicions. Some of them must have
arisen from the charge that McMahon
and the Treasury were hostile to Mc-
Ewen’s line on tariffs, which is that
social factors including the provision
of jobs and the ability to absorb Aus-
tralia’s migrant intake in manufacturing
industries must be taken into account
in tariff making as well as such things
as economic factors and efficiency.
These charges have been consistently
repeated and accepted.
Last week McEwen laid the social
aspect of his tariff policy on the line.
Said McEwen: “I know that in political
terms it’s pretty difficult for farm
industries which, in population terms,
provide employment for about 9 per-
cent of the workforce to persuade
the industries which provide the other
91 percent of the workforce that they
ought to have lower wages so that
farm industries can have lower costs
and that they should have lower tariff
protection so that you (farmers) may
have lower costs.
“But it is not conceivable that the
clock will be turned backwards
tariffs to a large extent provide the
essential employment for the whole
Australian workforce. It would not
be a very practical thing to make a
frontal attack on this. A Trade
Department study shows that the cost
of tariff to wool, if you take the wool-
growers’ other activities into considera-
tion, represents less than one cent a
lb. of wool. The cost burden attribut-
able to the tariff and bounty on items
directly required by woolgrowers is
.85 cents a lb.”
McMahon was immediately hit in the
Parliament with this: Asked Jim Cop'e,
Labor, N.S.W., “In view of the
Treasurer’s obvious interest in Austra-
lian tariff policy and his Department’s
role in its formulation, are he and his
departmental advisers prepared to be
counted among the supporters of a
tariff policy that the Tariff Board has
stated is more than 30 years out of
date? Does the Treasurer’s view on
this matter differ from that of Mr.
McEwen?”
Holt’s heart must have been in his
mouth. McMahon could have got up
and hedged and skirted in a manner
which would have shown to the Parlia-
ment that he was indeed in conflict
with McEwen on this subject and pro-
duced a situation which Labor could
have exploited mercilessly to exacer-
bate further feelings between the
Liberals and the Country Party.
McMahon, instead, held out the olive
branch to McEwen in an unmistakable
fashion.
Said McMahon: “I believe that the
policies of the Minister for Trade, Mr.
McEwen, are correct. For political
reasons altogether too much has been
made of an alleged difference between
Mr. McEwen and myself on tariffs.
The simple fact is that I have never
made a statement on tariffs since I have
been Treasurer and I have never ex-
pressed an opinion on tariff outside the
Cabinet Room since I have been
Treasurer. I support the policy of
Cabinet and Mr. McEwen to the limit
of my capacity.”
Whether McEwen will pick up the
olive branch, and have it out with Mc-
Mahon whether or not McMahon has
any association with the Basic Indus-
tries Group remains to be seen. In
my judgment the two men will never
be close. There will always be per-
sonality clashes. Quite clearly neither
is the other’s favorite cup of tea. But
personality clashes are far less danger-
ous for a Government than clashes on
such fundamental aspects of policy as
Tariffs and on whether either is actively
moving to destroy the other politically.
Holt must also have been pleased
with Gorton’s handling of the VIP
issue in the Senate where Holt has,
and unless he wins five States at the
forthcoming Senate elections must con-
tinue to have, endless headaches. Gor-
ton’s performance must have convinced
the Prime Minister that he made the
right decision when he appointed Gor-
ton as Government Leader in the
Senate in succession to the Supply
Minister Senator Henty, who is retir-
ing from the Senate on June 30 next.
When I say that I am not denigrat-
ing the achievements of Henty, who
during his period as the Government
Leader in the Senate got through, with-
out losing much skin, the bulk of the
Government’s legislation at times when
the Government controlled only a
minority vote, and when individual
Government Senators were determined
to display their independence of mind.
Gorton’s line was “the Government
can’t win on this VIP flights issue. As
it can’t win, the thing to do is to reduce
the extent of the loss to the irreducible
minimum.”
Gorton did this by supplying the
Senate with every item of information
that it had asked for concerning the
use of VIP flights by Ministers and
others entitled to use the flights, and
by promising that if there was anything
else the Senate wanted he would either
supply it or break his neck trying to
supply it.
This created the situation in which
the Senate and House of Representa-
tives could grumble about individual
flights and question the necessity for
some of them, but neither chamber
could complain that any information
was being kept from them.
This had the effect of cutting the
ground from under the feet of Oppo-
sition Senate Leader Lionel Murphy,
who was contemplating a move to have
the Secretary of the Air Department,
Mr. A. B. McFarlane, summoned before
the bar of the Senate to answer ques-
tions on the VIP flight, in place of Air
Minister Howson, who is overseas. Gor-
ton’s attitude paid off immediately.
Murphy did not carry on with his pro-
posal and a split immediately developed
in the hitherto solid ranks of Labor and
the Democratic Labor Party.
Senator Vince Gair, DLP Leader,
told the Senate that what he and his
colleague, Senator Frank McManus,
Vic., wanted was information so that a
check could be kept on abuse of the
VIP flights. But the DLP did not expect
the Prime Minister and Ministers to get
around Australia “like swagmen.”
For Holt it was not a bad week. Due
to Gorton he was off the Parliamentary
hook that Labor and the DLP had
jointly kept him on over the VIP
flights. More importantly, in the long-
term, McMahon had offered McEwen
an olive branch which, if accepted,
could do much to improve Liberal-
Country Party relationships.


AUSTRALIA
Where sterling goes
Australia won’t go too
A PERPETUAL TOPIC for specula-
tive talk in financial circles throughout
the world is the question: will sterling
devalue? Such talk has grown a little
louder than usual with the British
trying harder than ever to get into the
Common Market, and the closure of the
Suez Canal pushing Britain’s precarious
trade balance over into the red.
Australia is, of course, very much in-
volved because we hold some sBoom.
of sterling reserves, and despite the ris-
ing importance of Japan as a customer,
if you lump imports in with exports,
Britain is still our biggest trading part-
ner. Canberra has been taking a quiet,
intense look at the possibilities, and
there appears to be a clear contingency
plan should the British take the plunge.
The intention is not to budge to
maintain the present Australian ex-
change rate against gold and other
currencies. “Our economy is in a funda-
mentally healthy state, and we have no
long-term balance-of-payments prob-
lem. It’s as simple as that. We wouldn’t
have any reason for going down with
the British,” was the blunt way a senior
Government man put it last week.
The only possible snag could be the
woolgrowers. If Britain devalued, other
major wool exporters, New Zealand
and South Africa, would be likely to
follow. That would give them a com-
petitive advantage over us in selling
their wool, and woolgrowers could
therefore be expected to put pressure on
our Government to follow the British.
Not that the Government expects a
British devaluation now. Their view is
that two situations could produce it: a
further deterioration in the British bal-
ance of payments and serious French
interest in having Britain in the Com-
mon Market. Although the Suez
closure is costing Britain s2som. to
s3oom. a year, and there has been no
fundamental improvement in its
economy, further balance-of-payments
crises are unlikely as long as it is in
recession. And the French line on
British entry into the Common Market
is as tough now as ever. The Australian
Government thinks it will be at least
two years before there is the possibility
of any progress on the question of
British entry.
The French, meanwhile, would like
Britain to devalue, since such a move
would finish sterling as a major reserve
currency and cut Britain down to size.
The British, for their part, will only
devalue if they are forced to: Wilson
has staked so much politically on main-
taining sterling. And there is always the
danger that a sterling devaluation
would produce widespread retaliation,
eroding the advantages for British trade
while bringing big losses of prestige and
confidence. Which is a reason why few
bankers, national or international, are
seriously urging the British to do it.
Still, the Australian contingency
plans are laid. There has been a gradual
spreading of our international reserves
so that we now hold a larger propor-
tion in dollars and other currencies. We
cannot go much further out of sterling,
however, because within the next two
years we have over slsom. of London
loans to refinance. And we know that
the British Government simply would
not let us raise that sort of money if
we undermine them now by selling
out our sterling.
Australia House
Separate empire
THE PEOPLE OF Canberra never
really knew Sir Alexander Downer very
well. When in Government he spent
most of his time in South Australia on
his baronial estate in the hills above
Adelaide. In Canberra he is remem-
bered best for a quaint baroque foun-
tain he left to the civic authorities and
which stands in a courtyard in the
city centre.
As High Commissioner to Britain he
is regarded as a rather aloof figure. The
High Commission is the one overseas
post not run by the Department of
External Affairs; it comes under the
PM’s Department. It is something of
an empire of its own, notorious for its
lack of capacity for gathering intelli-
gence on the local political scene and
for the paucity of its reporting. Its
public activities run mostly to PR
stunts, such as distribution of the annual
Christmas cake made with Australian
dried fruit.
Australia House, as our High Com-
Sir Alex Downer (r.) ... PR stunts
mission in London is called, went on
longer than anyone in insisting that
the British should retain their military
presence in Asia. The High Commis-
sioner’s speeches hardly seem any more
with-it.
Sir Alex appears to many to be
adopting the role of the elder statesman
rather than that of representative of
his country in Britain. Certainly reports
of his speech last week, the third in as
many weeks, telling the British they
should stay out of the Common Market
rather than abandon the Common-
wealth, suggested it.
He went on: “If by imaginative and
determined effort we could evolve a
Commonwealth whose members worked
in close conjunction with the United
States, then statesmen could create a
force in two hemispheres of such magni-
tude that no other combination of
powers could shatter it.”
Sir Alex is completely beyond the
control of the External Affairs Depart-
ment. Whereas the head of every other
Australian diplomatic post in the world
is, naturally, under the control of
External Affairs, you have to go down
the list to fourth place before you find
the External Affairs man in Australia
House. Even more oddly, although
there are special sections with the
External Affairs Department in Can-
berra for every other part of the world,
there is no section for Britain.
Officially, relations with Britain are
not taken to be part of our foreign
policy. Communication with the British
goes through a complex system of
bureaucratic channels. For example, the
British High Commission in Canberra
formally addresses all of its inquiries
or messages to the PM’s Department,
but, in fact, always sends a copy simul-
taneously to External Affairs to bypass
red-tape.
Australia House is, of course, our
oldest foreign diplomatic post, and the
“special relationship” with Britain was


the reason for it remaining directly
responsible to the Prime Minister. But
it is increasingly spoken of as an his-
torical anachronism, and High Com-
missioner Downer’s odd behaviour is
rapidly increasing the number of
people who feel that it is time for a
change. Downer, himself, has been in
London for three years now. He must
be due for retirement soon. A re-
organisation could come then.
The RSL Congress
A realistic policy toward Asia
THE RETURNED SERVICES
LEAGUE has come a long way since
1960 when it refused to allow Mr. New-
man Rosenthal to speak against the
White Australia policy. Who could
ever have thought, just a few years
back, that before the ’sixties were done
the RSL would be promoting the cause
of the immigration of Asian ex-service-
men and calling for stronger economic
and diplomatic bonds with Japan?
It was not surprising that Mr. Whit-
lam, himself a member, thought it
reasonable to tell last week’s 52nd an-
nual national congress of the Returned
Services League that “I have been long
disturbed that so often the League
appears to be restrictive and con-
formist,” though it was odd to hear him
continue this line of attack with the
metaphor “sometimes they give the
impression of being a bunch of knights
charging in all directions.”
But the caution was surely misplaced
this time. The president of the Vic-
torian Branch, Brigadier W. H. Hall,
told the Congress: “We must do every-
thing we can and the RSL can help in
this —to strengthen our ties with Indo-
nesia to develop further goodwill . . .
Japan is the only country in the area
potentially able to hold a check on a
militaristic China. It is imperative that
the close liaison which is evolving be-
tween Australia and Japan should con-
tinue and increase .” The Brigadier was
not booed from the hall. A few years
ago he would have been lucky to escape
with his medals.
A realistic policy toward Asian coun-
tries and not just in military terms
was something, epecially when at-
tached to a re-examination of immigra-
tion attitudes, and there was even a
slight opening to the Left, in the direc-
tion of one of the Labor Party’s several
conflicting lines on Vietnam. The
National President, Sir Arthur Lee, told
the congress that the bombing of tar-
gets in North Vietnam was “as much a
political as a military operation and the
unfortunate political implications of the
bombing cannot be ignored.”
Sir Arthur addressed the Federal
Government: “The Government should
be in a position to state publicly that
it is constantly searching for a satisfac-
tory alternative.” However, some com-
mentators overlooked the fact that he
prefaced his comments on the political
implications of the bombing with the
RSL knights Yeo and Lee ... political implications
judgment: “Militarily we can hardly
question those experts who affirm the
success the bombing has achieved in re-
ducing North Vietnamese military
capability.”
The questioning of the defence and
military policies of the Federal Govern-
ment was a consistent theme of the
congress. RSL lobbying for increased
Government aid for ex-servicemen plus
a rather ritualistic kind of anti-
Communism are what are usually ex-
pected from these annual congresses,
but behind the criticisms of the recent
congress was the consistent presumption
that the Federal Government was
devoid of initiative in its foreign policy
and without imagination in its economic
and immigration attitudes to the Pacific
region.
The RSL now shows clear signs of
distrusting simplistic slogans like “All
the Way with LBJ,” and a number of
its leaders are expressing private con-
cern that the Federal Government
seems incapable of building up its own
network of influence and pre-diplomatic
alliances in Asia.
• Even the more predictable and con-
servative members of the RSL are be-
coming critical of Federal leadership.
The grand old ex-service trouper Sir
William Yeo last week accused the
Government of laziness and inactivity
in its dealings with Communist propa-
ganda emanating from Hanoi and
Peking: “These things are going on and
we can do little to frustrate them be-
cause the Government ties our hands
all the time.” Sir William again urged
the publication of a Government White
Paper naming Australian Communists
and their fields of operation. It did not
seem to occur to him that perhaps the
Government was not sufficiently in-
formed to publish such a paper. But the
idea has occurred to more than one
member of Federal Cabinet.
Airline pilots
Applying the brakes
IT IS NOT JUST Australian airline
pilots who like rocking the plane. The
latest fuss with TAA and Ansett-ANA
pilots over taking their overtime into
account when establishing their super-
annuation entitlements is part of a
world-wide pattern of pilot rumblings.
Hardly a month has gone by without
some pilots somewhere in the world
either going on, strike or. threatening to.
Last month, Alitalia pilots staged a
three-day stoppage. At present BOAC
pilots are disputing with their manage-
ment over flying time and overtime
payments. A few months ago Air India
pilots went on strike (grounding seven
of the company’s nine Boeing 7075) on
what they termed “a question of pres-
tige, not of money.” Air France is hav-
ing continuing problems because of
governmental refusal to follow a ground-
staff pay rise with a similar one for
aircrew. Sabena pilots went on strike
in May last year. SAS pilots went out
in June as Norwegian, Danish, and


“30 days hath September, April, June, and November. And
all have only 65 hours each according to the airline pilots”
Swedish pilots demanded better deals
on salaries and pension regulations.
The disruption of Australian airline
services toward the end of last month,
as pilots refused to work more than
their superannuation limit of 65 hours
a month, follows last year’s disastrous
Qantas strike. And there is every chance
that the question of crewing the DC9s
and Boeing 737 s that is at present caus-
ing such a disturbance in the United
States (pilots say three are needed; air-
lines and aircraft manufacturers say
two are plenty) could become an issue
In dispute here sooner or later.
Ansett and TAA had avoided the
threat of direct action by local
pilots last year when the Ansett group
quickly accepted the pilots’ demands
for a substantial wage rise. But since
there are only two local operators. and
they both agreed to the wage rise
they were in a far different position
from Qantas, which competes against
the world’s airlines and whose refusal
to grant its pilots their claims brought
on last November’s strike.
Airline operators all around the
world are likely to suffer even more
from the strong bargaining position of
the pilots because the pilots’ position
increases in strength as the job of flying
Bigger and faster aircraft requires in-
creasing training and skill.
How do you curb this bargaining
power? The Australian Parliament last
week passed an Act forcing local pilots
to use the Arbitration and Conciliation
system instead of resorting to direct
action. The Court is empowered to
take action against the pilots’ union.
It will have its first test in dealing with
the present superannuation dispute, as
the airlines have delayed negotiations
with the pilots on this subject, which
blew up in the middle of last month,
until after the Government’s Bill was
passed. The pilots, having become
unionists, can scarcely be surprised that
they are now treated like unionists.
VIP visitor
Souvanna Phouma
THE HE/iD OF Government of Viet-
nam’s “closest domino” arrives in Aus-
tralia this week. Mr. Holt, announcing
the visit of Laotian Prime Minister
Souvanna Phouma, pointed out that the
country is already “a victim of North
Vietnamese aggression.” In contraven-
tion of the 1962 Geneva Agreement on
the neutrality of Laos, about 20,000
North Vietnamese troops occupy the
eastern portion of the country, which
has become the major supply-line for
men and munitions being sent into
South Vietnam. Indigenous Com-
munists, the Pathet Lao, led by half-
brother Prince Souphanouphong, con-
trol considerable areas in the north of
the country, having refused to join in a
coalition Government.
Souvanna Phouma, South-East Asia’s
“man on a tightrope,” in power since
1960, has survived plots, and attempted
coups (usually followed by their
leaders’ exile to Thailand), and has
been a welcome visitor in Paris, London,
and Washington, in pursuit of the
neutralist policy he sees as the right one
for his country.
The Australian Government will be
interested to hear Prince Souvanna
Phouma’s views on the practicality of
various forms of settlement in Vietnam
and his assessment of North Vietnam’s
strength. The Laotian leader is prob-
ably well informed about the state of
the Communist insurgency in north-
east Thailand, which is just across the
Mekong River from his capital of
Luang Prabang and far distant from
the Thai capital, Bangkok.
In his public statements, Phouma is
likely to provide useful support for the
Government’s proposition that our
involvement in Vietnam has the back-
ing of the people of Asia and that a
Communist victory in Vietnam would
have profound consequences beyond
that country.
Australia’s relations with Laos are
mainly economic: we have put a Snowy
Mountains team to work doing investi-
gations for a hydro-electric scheme on
the Mekong River. We have supported
an exchange stabilisation fund which
enables the small Laotian economy to
totter along despite the need to sustain
an army of 80,000. In fact, to its credit,
Australia has proved to be one of the
half dozen or so countries in the world
most showing an active interest in this
small and divided country.

Trade unions
Breakaway?
IN MELBOURNE THIS week the
final steps are being taken either to
avert or to make permanent the biggest
split in the trade union movement and,
ultimately, the Labor Party since the
1955 disaster.
Ranged on one side is Trades Hall
secretary Mr. Mick Jordan and the
group of more than 50 unions which
support him. On the other side are 27
rebel unions led by the Communist
secretary of the Amalgamated Engin-
eering Union, Mr. Laurie Carmichael.
Both leaders are tough and wily
Jordan... concessions
negotiators and good political haters;
Jordan hates Communists and Car-
michael hates the system and union
officials who do not seek its overthrow.
The immediate cause of the trouble
is the refusal of the rebel unions to
pay their affiliation fees to the Trades
Hall. Already they owe about $23,000
and claim that they are not obliged to
pay because the recent heavy increases
in union affiliation fees were pushed
through without the large Left-wing
unions being properly consulted.
Carmichael and the three members
of the Victorian ALP central execu-
tive who are his lieutenants in the
present dispute have been negotiating
with Jordan and his supporters on a
kind of “no taxation without represen-
tation” platform. They have declared
that unless the Left gets a massive in-
crease in representation on the floor of
the Trades Hall and on the THC
executive they will not pay.
Jordan is reported to have offered
some concessions on executive member-
ship, but • will not allow the Com-
munists and their supporters any sig-
nificant increase in delegates to the
Trades Hall. He has now told them
that if they do not pay up their dues
they will lose THC membership.
Now that his bluff his failed, Car-
michael has the alternatives of allowing
his unions to drift back slowly into the
Council, paying their dues a few at a
time, or of breaking away and forming
a separate union movement.
A problem for Carmichael is' that
while he can control most of his Left-
wing ALP associates and, also, the
Peking-line Communist officials, he
may find it difficult to argue the
Moscow-line Communists into support-
ing a breakaway movement. At present
a breakaway by the Left would weaken
its influence in the ACTU, and just at
a time when things look promising.
But Carmichael has strong and mili-
tant support, including that of about
11 members of the ALP executive who
are union officials, and if he decides to
make the break most of them will
follow. Most likely the ALP would
shift its offices from the present Trades
Hall and go with the splinter group.
Such a set of circumstances could offer
Mr. Whitlam just the opportunity he
has been looking for.

Communists and Catholics
No compromise
AS REPORTED IN The Bulletin last
week, dialogue between the Communist
Party and the leaders of the Austra-
lian Jewish community appears to
have collapsed, but the Party is taking
consolation in its burgeoning contact
and increasing influence with Catholic
intellectuals, both lay and clerical.
The Communist Party leadership
gave out the message in the draft
documents adopted by its central
committee at this year’s National Con-
gress. Under the general heading
“towards a coalition of the Left” the
Party noted: “A growing contribution
to the constructive solutions of the
problems of society comes from im-
portant trends in the religious com-
munities, including the Catholic
Church (which is growing in numbers
and power). Progressive religious
trends concern themselves with move-
ments for peace and social justice and
increasingly question capitalist ethics.
Differences between conservative and
progressive trends in the Churches
express the great impact of today’s
issues upon all ideologies and institu-
tions, creating new conditions for dia-
logues between, and common action by,
all who seek radical social reform.”
A few weeks after the official adop-
tion of this attitude the Party was
encouraged in its efforts toward a Left
coalition by an article in the Mel-
bourne “Catholic Worker” in which
philosophy lecturer Dr. Max Charles-
worth outlined the rules for Catholic-
Communist dialogue.
These were neatly summarised in the
Communist “Tribune.” “Firstly, both
sides must be willing to avow their
past sins and mistakes, admitting their
mutual responsibilities for past antagon-
isms and enmity.”
“Secondly, each side must acknow-
ledge that they have something to hear
from each other and are willing to
talk to each other and not at each
other . . . Thirdly, both parties must
conduct their dialogue without any
ulterior motives, trusting, as the
ecumenists say, in the Holy Spirit . . .
Fourthly, each party should remain
true to its own principles, and not
attempt to achieve any kind of false
compromise . . .”
Dr. Charlesworth quoted the French
Communist Roger Garaudy, formerly
Dr. Charlesworth and Archbishop Knox
best known as the most articulate
defender of the Soviet intervention in
Hungary in 1956 and of the jailing of
Cardinal Mindszenty. “We offer dia-
logue without prejudice or hindrance.
We do not ask anyone to stop being
what he is. What we ask is, on the
contrary, that he be it more and that
he be it better.”

AMPHORA
Men who prefer only the finest pipe tobacco, smoke Amphora. And for
good reason. Tobacco specialists in Holland select the world’s choicest
tobacco leaves for Amphora blends. Each leaf is masterfully mellowed
and blended to make every pipeful of Amphora consistently excellent.
And downright satisfying. So pick a pouch of Amphora . . . it’s a gentle
smoke.

m
and the publication of Dr. Charles-
worth’s rules for dialogue, there have
been a number of meetings in both Syd-
ney and Melbourne between leading
Party members and Catholic intellect-
uals, most of the latter supporters of
the “Catholic Worker” and members
of the new Catholic peace group, “Pax.”
There is no evidence so far that the
Catholic promoters of the policy of
dialogue have requested Communist
Party assistance in alleviating religious,
political, and intellectual persecution of
non-Communist groups in the Soviet
Union and Eastern Europe.
However, it is clear that the policy
of dialogue has advanced some distance.
The Communist Party now seems to
have a “hot-line” through which the
latest news is delivered on Catholic
affairs. A recent issue of the “Tribune”
reported that some bishops and an
archbishop were moving to stifle dia-
logue between Catholics and Com-
munists. “Tribune” was first to report
that the new Catholic Archbishop of
Melbourne, Dr. Knox, had instructed
one of his priests, Father Ron Marstin
S.M., not to deliver a paper to the
September “Pax” seminar.
The Communist paper also reported
that Father Denis Kenny had been
advised by the provincial of the Marist
order in Australia that he could go for
a year’s study in the U.S.A. immedi-
ately. “Tribune” added: “It is under-
stood that Father Kenny then men-
tioned that he had unfinished commit-
ments including a paper for the “Pax”
seminar. He was then advised that it
would be better if he did not deliver
the paper.”
Although Father Kenny’s paper re-
mained undelivered the strength of the
Communist lines of communication
was revealed in the fact the “Tribune”
was able to quote from sections of it.
Last week “Tribune” printed longer
extracts of the same undelivered address
in which Father Kenny said, among
other things: “There is an increasing
volume of evidence that the West and
especially the U.S.A. have been to
some extent responsible for the genera-
tion of cold-war tensions: we have
been subjected to 20 years of partisan
propaganda in the interests of a cap-
italist ideology . . .”
Last week Father Marstin con-
firmed the stories in “Tribune” and
said that the Communist account of
events was “substantially true,”
although neither he nor Father Kenny
had given “Tribune” the information
directly. lather Marstin said he had
submitted the paper he had prepared
for the “Pax” seminar to Archbishop
Knox after being x’equested to do so
by his provincial superior. He said
that the Archbishop had asked him
“to refrain from delivering and pub-
lishing” the paper.
The obvious antipathy of Arch-
bishop Knox to dialogue as it is at
present has caused disappointment in
“progressive” Catholic groups, but it
is unlikely to interrupt the flow of Com-
munications now established.


THE
DRUGS
DILEMMA
What policy?
ON THE SURFACE of it the defen-
ders of some kinds of drugs seem to
have an arguable case. The community
response and legislative reaction, they
say, to the increasing use of drugs for
pleasure or private experiment is based
largely on irrational and contradictory
fears. And what right have politicians
—Andrew Jones’ statement aside
who regularly open three packets of
cigarettes a day and not uncommonly
knock down a bottle of whisky in a
night to crush those who prefer a
lash at pot or LSD?
As one agitated correspondent in the
daily Press wrote a couple of weeks ago:
“. . . even if the claims put forward
in the newspapers are true, it seems
debatable that LSD is more harmful to
the user and society than cigarettes,
excess alcohol, or cars that are driven
too fast. But there are no laws being
enforced at the moment which stop the
use of cigarettes by adults or minors
. . . There are penalties for drunken-
ness and excess speed; yet there are no
laws against providing a man with a
case of beer or a car which can do
100 m.p.h. . . .” The correspondent
avowed that he represented a minority
which Australian Governments were
using as a scapegoat to cover their own
faults. His letter and others like it have
emerged mainly in protest against strict
measures adopted against the use of
LSD. On the basis of the latest World
Health Organisation reports, the cam-
paign for liberality might be better
conducted on behalf of marihuana.
Marihuana—or pot, cannabis, Indian
hemp, hashish, kif, dagga, or whatever
of its multiple names (according to
one writer an English Police Staff
College keeps a list of more than 200) —
may mostly conjure up images of orgies
in Californian flesh-pots or stupefaction
in Moroccan cellars, but “World
Health,” the magazine of WHO, says:
“The general effects of cannabis seem
to be the liberation of certain inhibi-
tions, accompanied by mild hallucina-
tions. There is usually a feeling of
foolish well-being, often marked by un-
controllable laughter and giggling.
Cannabis does not appear to affect
sleeping habits and may mildly stimu-
late the appetite . . . cannabis promotes
hilarity, talkativeness, and increased
sociability. A sufficiently strong dose
will distort perception, particularly of
time and space, and impair both judg-
ment and memory. There is also a
warping of emotional reactions that may
take the form of irritability and con-
fusion.
“For some people the drug acts as an
hallucinogen and lowers the sensory
threshold, making paintings seem more
vivid and the experience of listening to
music more intense. Anxiety and aggres-
siveness may result from intellectual and
sensory confusion. There is no develop-
ment of physical dependence, nor un-
equivocal proof that lasting mental dis-
turbances have been produced by can-
nabis, although predisposed people may
have temporary psychoses.”
Compared with alcohol, this makes
marihuana seem a slightly milder drug,
especially since it does not damage the
nervous system or the liver, lead to
malnutrition, or induce chronic addic-
tion. But in most countries pe.ople are
jailed and fined for distributing it or
having it in their possession. In Aus-
tralia the drug is not readily accessible
to potential customers. In Victoria nine
people were charged in 1965 with
offences relating to marihuana; last year
a few less, though at least one of them
was jailed. Customs officers seized only
11.050 z. in 1965. Unlike stronger drugs,
most of it is home-grown.
Although an outlaw, the drug has
many defenders, even celebrators. A
popular song dating from the New
Orleans jazz era goes:
In her Victory Garden
The tea grows all around.
She plants, you dig,
She flips your wig.
Get help, take care,
Look out, beware
Of Sweet Marihuana Brown.
According to the latest reports, mari-
huana has replaced brandy at elegant
candle-lit dinner parties in San Fran-
cisco. It is no stranger to Paddington
and South Yarra. Although controlled
as rigidly as heroin in Australia, Europe,
and America, the drug has been cauti-
ously defended by even such an eminent
medical authority as the British journal
“Lancet,” which ran an editorial in
1963 raising the question of whether it
might be better for the Government to
legalise it and tax the sales instead of
continuing a complete ban under
criminal law.
Promoters of lysergic acid diethy-
lamide, of course, claim that if there
is a case for pot, then how much
stronger the case is for LSD, which is
supposed to induce, among other
things, religious and mystical states. In
the U.S.A., LSD devotees have their
own magazines, including the “Psyche-
delic Review,” and an active propa-
gandist in Dr. Timothy Leary, who for
a time had a thriving religious group
around him. LSD is one of a number
of drugs called “hallucinogens” and,
more rarely, “psychotomimetric” by
pharmacologists, and “psychedelic” or
“soul-illuminating” by others. Dr.
Leary encourages his followers to release
their egos under the power of the drug
and flow on a “cosmic wave” of new
understanding. Those who have won
such release lay claim to all kinds of
insights into themselves and the nature
of things. Some psychotherapists have
believed LSD to be a “wonder drug” in
the cure of psychoses. Leary and others
have praised its ability to help in the
rehabilitation of criminals. Authorities
and subjects differ on whether the drug
is habituating or addictive. One subject
who recorded the “most blissful” experi-
ence replied when offered another dose:
“I don’t think that I will take the drug
again, at least not now . . . I’ve had one
wonderful day. Maybe we shouldn’t
ask for more than one such day in a
lifetime.”
WHO is not convinced and reports
criticisms that “the subject often loses
interest in his career, his profession of
family, and prefers to drift through life
seeking more ‘cosmic’ experiences” and
that many subjects suffer severe mental
disturbance: “the subject feels himself
slipping out of his body, like an egg
eased from its shell, and may seem to be
looking at himself . . . the painfully


constructed ego or personality is bat-
tered to bits as if it were being hit
by a monstrous wave . . . they have lost
themselves and their distinctions from
the world in flux around them. This
assault not only on the ego but on the
entire personality is terrifying. Some
people crack so completely that it is
difficult for them to reconstruct them-
selves . . .”
Recently a committee of investigation
of the United Nations Commission on
Narcotic Drugs passed a resolution con-
demning the unauthorised use of LSD.
A later report by two New York scient-
ists, Hirschorn and Cohen, is that LSD
may fragment and rearrange chromo-
somes which determine biological char-
acteristics, and may lead to hereditary
abnormalities. Chromosome weaknesses
have been found in children whose
mothers had previously taken moderate
to large doses of LSD, and the syn-
dromes produced by LSD have been
found to resemble those of several blood
diseases whose victims had a high pro-
pensity to develop leukaemia and other
tumor-producing diseases.
In Australia LSD is now being legis-
lated out of non-medical existence along
with opium, cocaine, morphine, heroin,
and the rest. Legislation announced last
week by the Victorian Government will
impose penalties of up to ten years’ jail
and $4OOO in fines against those who
illegally prepare, manufacture, sell, deal,
or traffic in LSD. Any person found
in possession of the drug will be liable
to 12 months’ jail or a fine of $5OO, or
both. The Victorian Minister for Health
explained that “the Government has de-
cided to impose more severe penalties
because of the very serious implications
associated with LSD and teenagers.”
New laws to be introduced into New
South Wales after their parliamentary
reading on November 1 will impose a
maximum penalty of $2OOO or a two-
year jail sentence or both on drug
traffickers. In the Australian Capital
Territory the Minister for Health, Dr.
Forbes, intends to introduce a Bill im-
posing a fine of $lOOO or three years’
imprisonment or both. The old Federal
legislation covered only the sale or
supply of the drugs; the new will pro-
vide penalties for use or possession. It
seems certain that in a matter of months
and in all States the hallucinogenic
drugs such as LSD will be subject to
legislation which regards them as being
as dangerous as the addictive drugs
heroin, morphine, and opium. Under
present laws marihuana is regarded as
an addictive drug, a restricted substance,
or a poison, and carries similar penalties
to those for addictive drugs.
The partisans of LSD and man-
huana argue that it is unjust and un-
scientific to associate those drugs with
the chemistry of and the penalties for
addictive narcotics. So far as present
knowledge goes, the attitude and psy-
chology of the consumer of LSD and
marihuana, and the amounts taken,
are the crucial factors, just as they are
with alcohol. There is no law of in-
creasing consumption and degeneration
as there is with heroin. The comparison
with alcohol is the one which opens
most scope for debate. A recent issue
of “The Economist” used an illumin-
ating historical inversion:
“Suppose that, by the controlled
decomposition of a number of common
fruits and plants grapes, hops, grain,
potatoes, even dandelions - a cheap
method has just been found of mass-
producing a new drug. Taken orally,
it has marked short-term effects on the
human personality. In Britain the
most common production technique has
been christened ‘brewing.’ A further
chemical treatment of the brewed
liquid —a simplified version of the
distillation process used in manufac-
turing petrol will extract from the
liquor a colorless and tasteless fluid
that appears to contain its active prin-
ciple. The drug was first invented
centuries ago by the Arabs, who called
it al koh’l; it has been forgotten since
Marihuana has many defenders, like this Londoner, but most countries
punish users
A London hippies’ rally for legalised “pot”

it was banned as noxious throughout
Arabia in the seventh century. Since
its recent rediscovery it has acquired a
certain glamor among university stu-
dents and other bohemians, some of
whom claim it helps them to attain a
state of Eastern mysticism. Its critics
(few of whom have sampled the drug)
claim that ‘booze,’ as the hippies call
it, is harmful in itself, leading to irres-
ponsible and over-emotional behaviour
among teenagers. They also assert that
its use leads to indulgence in a wide
range of anti-social vices sexual
promiscuity, inattention to work, care-
lessness with money, and so forth.
Only yesterday a student was involved
in a fatal car accident after using the
drug, and the police are investigating
several similar allegations over the past
few weeks.
“Meanwhile, despite the slogan ‘Don’t
ask a man to smoke and drive,’ half-
yearly reports from the major mari-
huana companies are telling of in-
creased profits. Next week the police
will be empowered to compel drivers
to take tests showing whether they
have been smoking pot; but Christmas
shipments of choice weed from Rheims
and Cognac and Speyside are arriving
at the docks . . .”
The message of “The Economist’s”
neat trope is clear enough. It is perti-
nent for the protectors of public health
to ask themselves how much chance
would alcohol stand of being legalised
and socially regulated if it were only
recently discovered and if it were
judged by the same criteria as other
drugs. Alcohol is more likely to lead
to addiction than marihuana or LSD
and, probably, even cocaine; it damages
the nervous system, vascular system,
liver, and stomach; it leads to irrespon-
sible and anti-social behaviour and,
sometimes, to crime; it is a major
factor in the mortality rate on the
roads. There cannot be much doubt
that if alcohol were newly invented
most nations would prohibit its manu-
facture and sale, but that likelihood
does not clinch the argument for
other and less addictive drugs. Alco-
hol is a kind of habitual evil in most
societies. Most people have learnt to
live with it and a lot claim that
moderate amounts make them feel
good, though they admit to suffering
for their indulgence if they consume too
much. So far it seems that a total ban,
which would save millions of potential
alcoholics and just as many lives on
the roads, would bring with it the
evils of bootlegging, gangsterism, and
poisoning from home-brew.
But the fact that societies with a
long history of alcoholic consumption
are forced to tolerate its manufacture
and sale, its degenerative effects, and the
murders it causes on the roads is in
itself an argument against other drugs
which weaken inhibitions and disorder
the. perceptions of time and space.
Societies in which most families make
daily use of motor vehicles are not in
a strong position to accommodate the
use of hallucinogens and non-addictive
narcotics; and especially if they already
are subject to the problems of
alcoholism.
The further argument against drugs
such as LSD, marihuana, and cocaine is
that they may lead their users to try
more powerful substances for which the
danger of addiction can be 100 percent.
The great majority of those hooked on
opium and its addictive derivatives
morphine (six to ten times as powerful
as opium) and heroin (30 to 80 times
as powerful as opium) now seem to
have begun with milder drugs such as
marihuana and the amphetamines. The
social and legal taboos which associate
the milder drugs with the opiate nar-
cotics may be wrongly based, but once
the taboo is broken and the contact
with drug-pushers made the chances of
a subject moving on to the hard stuff
are strong enough to warrant legal
consideration.
Ironically the most dangerous drugs
are those that have genuine medical
usages. Barbiturate sleeping-pills can
do great danger destroying human be-
haviour and changing sensibilities, and
the kicks from amphetamine “pep
pills” can be perilous. But behind them
stand the body-shattering disasters of
those drugs that are completely, addic-
tive. Like the barbiturates and amphet-
amines, morphine, heroine, and cocaine
have genuine medical uses. But they
can nevertheless destroy people when
snuffed up, popped in the skin, and
finally shot along the main-line into the
bloodstream. Doctors have no doubts
about what these drugs do to our bodies,
whereas they are still in disagreement
about non-addictive drugs such as mari-
huana and LSD.
There are four remaining areas for
consideration: (i) Are the penalties for
the use of some drugs too high? (ii)
Does the legal lumping together of non-
addictive and addictive drugs actually
promote the process by which some
users move on from the former to the
latter? (iii) Could not some means be
devised whereby those who want to
experiment with non-addictive drugs
can do so under proper social control?
(iv) Should addicts and those on the
way to addiction be treated entirely as
medical cases and not as criminals?
On grounds of ideal justice a pos-
sible penalty of ten years’ jail for the
preparation of LSD, which the culprit
may want for himself, may seem unfair
when compared with the penalties im-
posed on the preparation of more
dangerous drugs. But the reaction of
governments was predictable. They are
not concerned so much with fairness as
with dramatising the dangers of a new
habit and a fear that it can lead to
habituation to the hard drugs.
There has been far too much in-
souciance about the taking of LSD.
In fact, the boasftul frivolity of
some of its users seems to have been a
factor in producing the new legisla-
tion. Twelve months’ jail for consum-
ing marihuana may also seem an
anomaly in a society in which drunken
drivers are regularly convicted and
suffer much smaller punishments, but
to this one rejoinder might be that the
penalties against drunken driving
should be increased.
Given their great dangers, ten years
seems a reasonable maximum for the
pedlars of the hard drugs. Punitive
measures against shipping companies
might even be considered, to give them
a greater interest in preventing the
smuggling of narcotics. On the other
hand, there is some question as to what
is achieved by big legal penalties
against people who have degenerated
enough to be hooked.
The failure of legal authorities to dis-
tinguish adequately between the various
kinds of narcotics contributes to the
sorts of misconceptions which allow, say,
heroin and marihuana to be regarded
with equal horror in the community
at large. It is therefore not surprising
that unsophisticated or psychologically
disturbed users of one drug graduate to
others which may be infinitely more
dangerous. In this area governments
could be expected to lead popular
opinion rather than both to follow it
and contribute to the problem.
On the question of whether addiction
is a crime or disease the World Health
Organisation says: “Never has the gap
between the medical profession and the
organised powers of society been wider
or more evident. The very term ‘addic-
tion,’ loaded with pejorative association
in English and discarded by WHO,
has been retained by the law and en-
forcement authorities of almost every
country. In such circumstances doctors
are understandably reluctant to treat
people dependent on drugs. Hundreds
of doctors have lost their licences for
treating patients in a manner not ap-
proved by enforcement officials. Most
doctors feel that ‘addicts’ suffer from
a deep-seated personality disorder, yet
the treatment accorded them is often
the same as that for aggressive
criminality and often more harsh.”
There should be constructive experi-
ments in the detection, treatment, and
follow-up of hard-drug addicts. This
needs money to set up new treatment
centres, but, above all, it needs the
risks of unorthodoxy for the very good
reason that orthodoxy doesn’t seem to
have worked. The use of hard drugs is
no ordinary problem, and medical
people and the police must be
prepared for extraordinary attempts to
solve it.
With such serious matters still un-
resolved there is scant hope for the
intellectual, the student, the bohemian,
or the hippie, concerned with his civil
liberties, to gain approval to use non-
addictive drugs under some set of
legally approved conditions.' The road
from LSD and Sweet Marihuana
Brown, as do so many other roads, leads
straight back to John Barleycorn.

THE PAPER
FACE OF
THE VIET CONG
By PETER SAMUEL
IT HAS BEEN THE ambition of most
Vietnam war photographers to get a
picture of the Viet Cong in action. But
despite the fact that this is a war fought
at very close quarters, it has never been
done. Not for lack of trying. Half a
dozen photographers have been killed
and scores wounded, but the best they
can get are pictures of Communist
troops as tiny black figures scurrying
into the distant undergrowth, or as
prisoners or corpses.
It is rather the same for the writer.
To get information on the Viet Cong
it is possible to interview prisoners and
defectors, but you cannot talk to the
men who still fight and struggle. The
way out comes from the fact that,
partly because of their attachment to
French clerkish traditions, partly as a
result of their relative lack of tele-
phones and radio communication, the
Viet Cong commit vast amounts of in-
formation to paper. As part of their
aim of establishing a parallel “govern-
ment” to that of Saigon, they have
created a considerable bureaucracy,
with its attendant papers and files.
In a war which is as much political
and organisational as it is conventionally
military, such documents are as much
a target as are enemy soldiers, supplies,
and weapons. The Australian intelli-
gence people at Nui Dat, for example,
now know all the Party members in the
province, which ones are behind in
their subscriptions, who pays VC taxes,
who belongs to the various front organi-
sations, and so on. It is this sort of
information which lays the basis for
operations designed to disable the entire
guerilla infrastructure of the Com-
munists in Phuoc Tuy province.
The most illuminating single docu-
ment of the war was captured by the
U.S. 101st Airborne in Khanh Hoa
province in April and declassified for
public release last month. It is the
20,000-word text of The Resolution of
the 4th Congress of The Central Office
for South Vietnam (COSVN). Classi-
fied “Top Secret” by the VC, this
resolution is an all-encompassing state-
ment of Communist strategy and tac-
tics, the program for every aspect of
their struggle, and an exceedingly
frank admission of their difficulties.
Together with about a dozen other
lesser documents, it provides a clear
picture of the present command struc-
ture of the Communists in South Viet-
nam and the current division of respon-
sibilities between different institutions.
One of the most important features
of this document is that it makes clear
that operationally the National Libera-
tion Front is insignificant. The Front
is mentioned only once in the 20,000
words of the COSVN 4th Congress
Resolution, and then only in the con-
text of calling for efforts to develop a
broader, more appealing “coalition
front.” The Communist Party in the
south, officially titled the People’s
Revolutionary Party since 1962, is re-
ferred to as the “southern branch” of
“The Party.” It appears then that
Communists in the south are members
of the one all-Vietnam Lao Dong
Party, headquartered, of course, in
Flanoi. At the very end of the Resolu-
tion in a list of factors making for
“ultimate victory” is the statement:
“We possess a Central Committee which
is clearsighted and which is headed by
Chairman Ho.”
There is specific confirmation from
several sources that major policy issues,
such as negotiations, are a matter for
Hanoi rather than for the Viet Cong
in the south to decide. They also,
incidentally, make it clear that negotia-
tions would not mean the end of the
fighting. A cadre’s notebook found in
Ninh Thuan province early this year
contains a long account of a speech
made at the COSVN Congress by
General Nguyen Van Vinh, head of the
Hanoi Reunification Department, and
according to these notes he said of
negotiations: “At present there are
several viewpoints with regard to war
and peace . . . Our policy: to continue
fighting until a certain time when we
can fight and negotiate at the same
time . . . The Party Central Com-
mittee entrusts the Politburo with the
task of deciding on the time for negotia-
tions ... We must fight to win great
victories with which to compel the
enemy to accept our conditions. If we
stop fighting no considerable success can
be achieved in negotiations . . .”
Captured documents show that most
of the mainforce war of regular units is
run direct from Hanoi, or to be more
precise, by a set of four commands
which are entirely North Vietnamese
and report to the Party Military Affairs
Committee in Hanoi. Of these, the
DMZ command has the largest number
of regular troops under its control—
four full divisions comprising 35,000
troops. These are backed by artillery
support and are engaged in textbook
positional warfare against the U.S.
Marines and South Vietnamese division
in the north of the country. They have
tied down a lot of American troops,
created a 400,000 - person refugee
problem, and stalemated pacification in
the three northernmost provinces.
In another of these commands (“the
B 3 Command”), a smaller version of
the DMZ border struggle smoulders in
the tri-border region where Laos, Cam-
bodia, and South Vietnam meet. Here,
the North Vietnamese deploy two small
divisions to tie down American troops
in this difficult country and to maintain
their major, supply line from southern
Laos and north-east Cambodia. Further
in-country from these lie three other
North Vietnamese divisions, positioned
between the heavily populated Binh
Dinh province to the south and the
“Quang” provinces to the north. These
troops, under the third Northern Com-
mand (called MRS), were very heavily
defeated in 1966 and are now greatly
under strength. Before the Americans
and Koreans arrived these divisions and
their now decimated southern predeces-
sors dominated the five easternmost
provinces, the “Street without Joy” of
the French. In 1965 they threatened to
cut South Vietnam in half, isolating
Central Vietnam. Now they are of no
more than nuisance value. The equiva-
lent of a further two North Vietnamese
divisions are thought to operate in Laos
and Cambodia protecting the roads and
trails into the south.
The Viet Cong command itself


(COSVN) has operational control of
only three mainforce divisions and
these are positioned on three sides of
Saigon. Two have had to be sub-
stantially rebuilt with northerners, and
all three are weak in numbers. The
VC sth, for instance, which is deployed
to the north of the Australian area of
responsibility, is down to about 5000
men. One regiment has been so knocked
around that it has withdrawn north to
the Cambodian border for recuperation.
These three face six full allied divisions
and their main task is to prevent the
allies from providing the protection
needed for pacification to proceed in
the area around Saigon and in the
delta.
The physical location of COSVN,
the Viet Cong headquarters, shifts be-
tween a set of bases—one just by the
Cambodian border in Tay Ninh
province to the north-west of Saigon, in
the rear of Zone C; another just inside
Cambodia to the west of Mimot; a
third, also in Cambodia up along the
border with Vietnam, at a “Camp Le
Rolland” (where the frontier switches
from running north-easterly to an align-
ment due north). It is from these bases
that it carries out its main role of
co-ordinating the Party hierarchy, which
extends down through zonal, province,
and district committees to village and
hamlet chapters.
COSVN acts both as the Viet Cong
military high command and as the local
-Party Central Committee. Provincial
committees, of which there are about
fifty, have control over “provincial
mobile” or “regional” troops, fulltime
regulars usually formed into a battalion
which operates mainly within its home
province. They number around 30,000,
in about 70 battalions.
From various sources, including the
captured COSVN 4th Resolution, it is
clear that there are tensions between
the demands of the COSVN regular
forces and the demands of the North
Vietnamese forces. The COSVN reso-
lution says bluntly: “Only half our
regular forces fought well. The regional
forces mostly did not fight well and
some of them hardly fought, while
others were so embarrassed that they
could not fight.” They are “embarras-
sed” for a variety of reasons. For one
thing they are very short of munitions
and medical supplies, since, naturally
enough, the North Vietnamese want to
keep what v they can get down the
trails for themselves. For another, their
numbers are being depleted by battle
casualties and defections. Two-thirds
of the new recruits into the Communist
forces are now from down the trail,
and, being northerners, they cannot
sensibly be integrated into regional
units. In any case, they are badly
needed for the big divisions, to which
top priority is given..
There are even greater tensions be-
tween the demands of the regular forces
and the demands of the guerilla units,
which are carrying out the guts of the
struggle in and around the villages,
rather than in the eight-tenths of the
country, where mountains, forests, and
swamps provide the necessary cover for
the regular divisions and regional bat-
talions. The village struggle is the
responsibility of about 100,000 guerillas
and 40,000 Party political cadres, and
their effort suffers as long as the order
is to “urgently increase regular forces”
and as long as these are regarded us
the top of the promotion ladder for the
keen revolutionary. One Communist
assessment, a memorandum found in
Zone C early in the year, put the matter
tersely: “Guerillas dropped to 180,000.
The requirement of this year is 300,000.
The decrease of quantity also involved
a decrease in quality. From 70 percent
to 80 percent of Party Chapters sepa-
rated themselves from the people. There
was a tendency among higher echelon
cadres to stay away from the people,
Very few Party members stayed close
to the people. About 20 or 30
percent of competent or skeleton cadres
were transferred to higher echelons. The
efforts of personnel were largely wasted,
Armed forces did not stay close to the
people to help in the community . . .
No efforts were made to take care of the
people, and cadres appeared too
authoritarian. It is desirable that ideo-
logical leadership should be revolu-
tionised . . .”
The COSVN 4th Resolution dealt
with the matter this way: “In certain
areas the combat efficiency of the
guerilla units has developed and they
fought well, but in other areas the
efficiency decreased or fluctuated so
that they could not fight the enemy,
People’s warfare was not well devel-
oped. Therefore, our effort to stretch
the enemy thin and batter him was not
uniform and carried out well.”

tures” are constantly inveighed against

little example of the sort of thing
which quite commonly occurs was
turned up at a checkpoint f near the
Australian camp at Nui Dat six weeks
ago. A woman travelling to Baria was
found to be carrying the following
letter: “To the Chairman of the Front
for the Liberation of South Vietnam,
Baria Province. We, the undersigned,
representatives of the people of Apa,
respectfully send this request and
statement to you (the Revolutionary

1967,” in Bien Hoa province, speaking
of the need to completely destroy Gov-
ernment influence in hamlets, has to
contain the qualification: “but it doesn’t
necessarily mean killing everybody,”
then some cadres have been resorting to
pretty rough methods.
On the other side it seems that,
despite their blunderings, the Ameri-
cans often win hearts and minds. Fol-
lowing a sweep operation in Long An
province, for example, a local cadre
reported, according to a captured docu-
ment: “The enemy behaved kindly to
the people to win their hearts. They
carried the children in their arms,
washed and changed their clothes. They
seemed to pay attention to the people’s
lives . . . Those who were wounded were
given thorough medical treatments . . .
in addition they assigned medics to be
on duty all night to treat the sick . . .
At the sanm time they propagandised
that after their medical treatment the
people were free to live in any place
they liked. As a result the people were
greatly influenced by the enemy’s
sinister scheme. Although the people
knew that the enemy was dishonest,
they seemed to appreciate his treat-
ments and compared them with those
performed by ours . . . While talking
about the enemy’s distribution of mos-
quito nets, some villagers stated that
the Americans were kind. Our cadres’
wives seemed. to be unhappy because
their husbands worked for us . .
A six-page document prepared by
the SVN Liberation Army Political
Department, entitled “Action against
the enemy, psychological warfare,”
starts by saying the Americans “seduce
our men with money, women, sym-
pathy, or resort to bombs . . . Such
a scheme is very dangerous . . . Our
cadres still underestimate the value
of the enemy propaganda. Our men
still listen to the enemy broadcasts and
read enemy magazines and newspapers.
The political views of our troops are
still insufficient and loose . . . The
enemy tries to increase the fear of
sacrifice and encourages pacifism. As a
result, a number of our soldiers have
been influenced by the enemy’s deceit-
ful propaganda . . . Defection occurs
frequently in various forces. Many
cases have resulted in disastrous con-
sequences. Some have killed our cadres
and soldiers, destroyed weapons, and
stolen secret documents before sur-
rendering to the enemy.” Summing up,
the report says that American schemes
“weaken our ideology, impair our
combat spirit, and finally induce our
cadres to side with the enemy and
become traitors.”
The solution, as usual, lies in severer
discipline and more intensive indoc-
trination: “When one has a deep hatred
of the enemy and a noble revolutionary
ideal, one is immune to the threat of
arms, the appeal of money and beauti-
ful women, and the lure of deceitful
tricks.”
The effects of poor morale are seen
in a number of ways. The clearest
measure is in the number of defections
to the Government under the Chieu Hoi
program. For 1966 they totalled 20,000
or just over six percent of Communist
fighting strength, and this year should
reach almost ten percent. Perhaps even
more debilitating than defection is
passivity on the part of Communist
agents in the villages. According to
COSVN: “Many Party committees at
various echelons failed to strengthen
leadership, or did not know how to
carry out leadership, or showed dere-
liction of duty or paid too much atten-
tion to details instead of trying to grasp
control over major problems.”
An interview with a Chieu Hoi rallier,
who had been a village cadre, provides
an example of what is happening in
some areas. Asked about reports he sent
to higher Party echelons, he said: “They
knew about the situation in my village
through the reports we sent them, but
they didn’t know about the real situa-
tion, because, most of the reports had
been falsified.” Asked whether the
higher echelons didn’t sometimes crit-
icise him for falling short of plans,
he replied: “Yes but we had our ex-
cuses. When we fell short, we reported
that month that we had to spend much
time on labor work, such as building
our camp, or we had to spend much
time on production work. We had to
go fishing and crabbing, and sell our
catch to the people to get money . .
The COSVN Resolution declared
bluntly that “Political struggle activities
were not brought up at the same rate
military activities and did not keep
up with military achievements . . .
Leadership and indoctrination of the
masses were weak ... In several areas
there were manifestations of the ten-
dencies of remaining aloof from the
masses, not following orders strictly,
and showing dereliction and tiredness.
All these deficiencies limited our suc-
cesses . . .”
It followed with a six-point policy.
1. More indoctrination “Only thus
can we make Party chapters capable
of functioning by themselves under
difficult circumstances and execute
policies from above without remaining
passive as before.” 2. Improve leader-
ship methods so village chapters can
“penetrate into the masses motivating
them and leading them ...” 3.
Improve the operation of chapters and
“ensure their regular operation with
practical content.” 4. Higher echelons
“must not just criticise and blame, but
instead we must be eager to provide
them with guidance and assistance in
the settlement of their difficulties.” 5.
“Red tape and a tendency to push the
workload down to the chapters must
be avoided.” 6. Village chapters must
be consolidated so that a “great num-
ber can be satisfactorily strengthened.”
Crisis may be too strong a word. But
having recently ploughed through about
200,000 words of internal documents
of the Viet Cong, I have found con-
tinuing evidence of a state of severe
disorder and demoralisation. The pic-
ture we so often get of the Communist
effort in Vietnam being a smooth-
running machine, run by dedicated
revolutionaries, prepared to make any
sacrifice, appears to be romantic non-
sense.
Most significantly, they appear to
be hopelessly confused about strategy.
They have no clear formula for vic-
tory. They speak sometimes of pro-
tracted struggle, of an effort to outlast
the Americans. At other times they
speak of the “imperative need for
decisive victories soon.” They have no
clear set of priorities, so they are unable
to -concentrate their efforts in any par-
ticular direction. They have not tried
to revert to mainly guerilla warfare,
and continue to put their best men
into regular units, yet their big divisions
show no promise of being able to
achieve military success.
The population continues slowly and
painfully, but certainly, to be taken from
their control. And politically their
credibility declines all the time. The
National Liberation Front is in the
process of being abandoned, since it has
failed. According to COSVN, a new
“united front with a platform inferior
to that of the NLF but endowed with
conditions to operate openly and attract
laborers, needy urban people, petit-
bourgeoisie and students” is needed.

Or perhaps an attempt is being made
to have it both ways again.
The September 1 “New Political
Program” of the Front promises a
broad “national union democratic
government,” which among other things
will “enforce broad democratic free-
doms,” “guarantee the inviolability of
the human person,” “enforce freedom of
enterprise,” and “encourage the capi-
talists in industry and trade,” “give due
consideration to the interests of small
traders and petty shopkeepers,” “nego-
tiate the purchase of land from land-
lords,’’ and “respect freedom of creed
and worship.” It promises pensions,
low-interest housing loans, a system of
conciliation and arbitration, an eight-
hour day and, yes, even a Vietnamese
RSL.
And yet at the same time it promises
more war. Not only a continuation of
the present “long and hard” war “until
total victory” but an undertaking “to
stand within the united bloc of the
Indo-Chinese peoples to fight U.S. im-
perialists and their lackeys” in Vietnam
and in Cambodia and Laos also. Twice,
the new program promises that with
victory it will “severely punish cruel
agents of U.S. imperialists,” foreshadow-
ing a bloodbath. If Johnson has a
credibility gap, then it is nothing com-
pared to that of the Communists in
Vietnam.
Yet, unfortunately they are sustained
by two things. One is a religious type
of faith in the power of indoctrinated
man. The other is the expectation of
success on “the second front against
U.S. imperialism, right on U.S. soil,”
where, according to the Hanoi news-
paper Nhan Dan, the American masses
are “firmly rising to demand immediate
cessation of the U.S. aggressive war.”
In Operation Cedar Falls, in January
this year in Zone C (where COSVN is
often based), a number of tapes were
picked up. One of these contains a
speech by the Deputy Commander of
the VC armed forces, Major-General
Tran Do, intended, so it appears, as a
morale-booster to be played to Com-
munist soldiers at indoctrination
sessions. It contains the following pas-
sage on negotiations and the responsi-
bility for conducting them: “The
Americans remain stubborn. They are
not yet disposed to meet our demands.
Some of you have heard they want
peace, that they will meet us at the
conference table, any time, at any place.
They are cheating us ... If we accept
the American proposals now, we will
have to fight again later on. We can
enjoy peace right now, but not for
long. We must not be confused. We
must be determined to gain military
victories. We must not be hypnotised by
the peace mirage ... to wage a war
and win the decisive victory we may
need hundreds of thousands of men, all
very determined to fight . . . Therefore
we have to be more determined regard-
ing the use of brute force, to avoid any
thought about the peace mirage, even
to stand firmly against any idea of
peace.”


ART DEALING
The very
best cop going
By CHARLES HIGHAM
“A RICH AMERICAN collector is
having dinner at a house in Sydney. As
he drinks more and more of his hostess’
excellent wine, the paintings on the
wall—the Drysdales and Dobells and
Nolans —begin to look better and better.
Finally, the collector says: ‘I must have
one, too.’ And the hostess replies: ‘Why
don’t you drop around the corner and
see Barry . . .’ ”
The words were Barry Stern’s: doyen
of the younger art dealers in Sydney,
smoothly sophisticated in a striped,
American-style, china-blue jacket. Serv-
ing tea in elegant blue cups in his “Holy
of Holies,” the expensively furnished
backroom of his gallery in Paddington,
Sydney, he was referring to the fact that
the art dealer’s real business today is
chiefly through the network of social
contacts which ensures that, when an
Establishment painter’s work comes on
the market, a dealer will hear about it,
and negotiate a private sale behind
the scenes; a gallery itself, and its show
of paintings, is often just a PR front
for the far more subtle and profitable
business of trading in the very few
painters whose sales reach the $2OOO
and over mark.
Stern is typical of the new breed
which has, in the past five years or so,
achieved a standard of almost fin de
siecle lacquered living in the midst of a
supposedly barbarous Australian city
ambience. These new men are apt to
have soft, cultured voices, wear exquisite
clothing, inhabit houses in the upper-
cost brackets, and surround themselves,
in their private viewing rooms at least,
with pile carpets and period chaise-
longues, select paintings hung in the
very best frames, walls of a peacock
brilliance, lamps casting a soft glow at
evening. In these hushed rooms, reached
only by the elect, the only sounds are
apt to be subdued recommendations of
paintings to clients (ranging from “This
will go so well with your French wall-
paper” to “This will offer you a new
intellectual experience”), the whirr of
an air-conditioner, the occasional chirp
of an ivory-white extension telephone,
and occasionally the excited cries of
a Bright Young Man who has dis-
covered that, in the gallery below, a
Very Rich Person has suddenly de-
cided to snap up half the paintings on
the premises.
We are all jealous of a good cop,
and some art dealers have, as well as
their undoubted enthusiasm, one of the
very best cops going. They dine in the
most exclusive houses, travel at least
once a year in tax-deductible grande
luxe, need no qualifications except a
horse trader’s flair and a nose for good
painting, and keep Barry Stern told
me he opens his gallery at 11.30 —-
excellent hours. Their galleries or
picture shops, if one wants to be mean
—• exude well-bred opulence: cool and
spacious, immaculately dressed young
men with soft quasi-Oxford accents
flitting about mysteriously in blue suits
or young ladies of a Bellevue Hill or
Toorak soignee air answering the tele-
phone with voices of a practised
smoothness. The inner sanctum beyond
the gallery itself is not easily pene-
trated: at the Clune Galleries, for
instance, you speak your name into per-
forations in the wall and a silver voice
answers, asks your credentials, and indi-
cates softly that you may now be ad-
mitted: a few moments later a youth
in dark blue descends and detaches a
shiny golden chain from the stairs it is
protecting.
This air of exclusiveness, of the visi-
tor entering a world where ordin-
ary everyday dirt and stress can have
no possible place, is essential to the sale
of paintings to wealthy clients. They
can imagine themselves in a more
modest replica of their own living-
rooms, seeing a painting glow in sur-
roundings that can at a pinch be said
to resemble their own. The dealer’s ex-
pert descriptive powers, soft, educated
voice, fashionable clothes, and expensive
grooming do the rest. Nouveau riche
women, in particular d’un certain age,
with more money than they know what
to do with, are responsive to the deli-
cate flattery, the expert charm of deal-
ers, most of whom are past masters in
the art of the soft sell, the technique of
piling detail on descriptive detail so
that buying the work of art becomes
finally irresistible. And of all the pres-
sures brought to bear, one of the most
recurrent is the reiterated one that
Mrs. Jones Must Be Kept Up With:
she has matching blue Cassabs, so Mrs.
Smith must have them, too.
In recent years dealing has become
so subtle and sophisticated that some
men have even abandoned the pretence
of having a gallery which shows artists
and do all their horse-trading on the
telephone or from their private houses.
Collectors themselves become dealers,
although they may need the really
steady brain of a dealer to help them
negotiate a sale to another collector.
To operate without a gallery calls for
really slick business sense, and perhaps
an added touch of personal charm,
since you have no prestige office to
surround your argument with a padding
of material comfort. But in the tight
little world of art fanciers, personal
friendship and the ability to smooth-
talk your way through cocktails and
dinner at candled tables or one late-
night coffee and brandy in plush
drawing-rooms in fake English accents
are often enough in a period when an
heiress to a fortune can quite likely
give her husband a Khmer bronze as
a birthday present, when Dobells and
Drysdales change hands for $40,000.
To be an art dealer is a condition
rather than a profession, but it pays
more than most. It was not always so
in Australia. For years the Macquarie
Galleries and the Art Lovers’ Gallery at
Artarmon in Sydney, and the Australian
Galleries in Melbourne, kept artists
going by taking rather meagre percent-
ages of actual exhibitions sales and
just kept afloat themselves; several
other galleries lost money in the early
stages.
Today, the situation is very different:
dealers get 33 l-3rd percent of the sales
of paintings (with some exceptions,
such as John Brackenreg of the Art
Lovers, who charge 25 percent and a
share of the exhibition opening’s enter-
taining costs) and are flourishing as
richly as painters, with a much firmer
hand on their pocketbooks (artists,
most dealers claim, are reckless spend-
ers). The exceptions to the rule of
affluence are those few idealistic dealers
who prefer to support the obscure, hand
out free gifts and often run their shows
at a loss, just eking out an existence
with the occasional freak sellout, one-
third of which can keep a gallery above
water for a few months.
Some dealers pay the artists exhibit-
ing with them an annual retainer, plus
the fare to travel overseas from time

Rudy Komon


to time, and most claim that the artist
is far better off here than he would be
in Paris, London, or New York, where
dealers sometimes take up to 70 or even
80 percent of sales and keep him going
on a pittance. Artists, in reply, tend to
grumble that dealers here do not suffi-
ciently promote them or push their
names (as New York dealers do) on
TV and the other public media.
It was not until the early 19505, long
before the real boom in Australian art
took place, that Rudy Komon, perhaps
the most dashing figure on the Sydney
art-market scene, combining a flair for
the market with a food-and-wine ex-
pertise, came here and instituted the
European method of paying an artist
an annual salary, getting him out of
various jams when necessary, and pay-
ing for trips abroad, all in return for
an exclusive right to show his work in
Sydney.
Friend of Kokoschka, Paul Henreid,
the celebrated cameraman Otto Heller,
and the great puppet master Jiri Tmka,
Komon was correspondent for a Czech
newspaper and for Associated Press in
Europe, attending Goebbels’ Press con-
ferences in Berlin pre-war and later
beating the world to the first report of
Masaryk’s death. In common with most
other dealers, Komon had no special-
ised knowledge of art, but his amateur’s
enthusiasm, stimulated by meeting
(through Trnka) with Czech painters
of the calibre of Spolinski and Zabran-
ski and with Kokoschka himself, was
finally able to express itself on his
arrival in Sydney. He sold Dobells
from an antique shop in Waverley (for
£25 each), and disposed of the first
and, he says, the only Kokoschka to
find a buyer here (for £600; it would
now be worth $20,000). He met Jon
Molvig, whose work reminded him of
Kokoschka, and supported him for years
until he started to sell at high prices;
he became fascinated by Bob Dicker-
son’s haunting, innocent, and primitive
paintings and took him on; later he
added Charles Blackman, Clifton Pugh,
and Leonard French to his stable. (“In
those days no one was buying French.
He was a display officer at the Vic-
torian Galleries, a young, bright boy,
and I went to his home and saw his
work, and was deeply impressed; he was
the most underrated painter in Aus-
tralia at the time.”) Later, Komon
said, he found Fred Williams in a tiny
studio; no one was interested in his
work.
None of these people was put on
formal contract (“You believed in
them, so they believed in you”). To-
day Komon has a stable of 14 painters,
of whom Fred Williams is probably the
best seller; he runs them and the
gallery with an infectious
enthusiasm.
After Komon, Terry Clune opened
a gallery in Macleay Street, Sydney, in
1958: with his partner, Frank Mc-
Donald, Clune really got going in
1961 when he bought the collection of
a director of Hutchinson, the publish-
ers, consisting of 150 paintings, two-
third European and one-third Aus-
tralian. Later the two men showed
European works of art as well as Aus-
tralian and gave a frequent emphasis
to historical Australian paintings.
When Clune went into the travel busi-
ness, McDonald took over as head of
the gallery, bought an old house in
Macquarie Street, and restored it to its
1839 original appearance.
“Terry really was more interested in
travel, anyway. I had a more intense
approach to art than he did. I realised
that if I came to this city address more
intensity still would be required,” Mc-
Donald told me. Like Komon, Mc-
Donald had no highly specialised know-
ledge of art, but he picked it up as he
went along. Art had also been his side
interest at an early age; partly educated
in New York, he belonged to the junior
section of the Metropolitan Museum of
Art. (“It wasn’t until I was quite grown
up that I realised I could make a liv-
ing at something I’d always regarded
as a hobby.”)
Kym Bonython, wealthy collector,
after the war, of Drysdales, Nolans, and
Arthur Boyds, opened his famous art
gallery in Adelaide in 1961, and in
1965 bought the Hungry Horse Gallery
in Sydney; he is about to open a new
version of this with more lavish
premises in Paddington: “The Hungry
Horse may be cute and picturesque, but
it’s got no storage space, and painters
like to show in big rooms. The new
gallery is, I think, the biggest commer-
cial one in the world. Of course the
critics especially Wallace Thornton
of the ‘Sydney Morning Herald’ are
bound to say, ‘lt’s quality that counts,
Mr. Bonython, not quantity.’ ”
Like the other dealers, Bonython pre-
fers to keep his artists on verbal con-
tracts only. He shows Nolan, Tucker,
Raft, Louis James, Brett Whiteley
among others, and represents the Marl-
borough Gallery in London here. He
has imported works by overseas artists
and has plans to exhibit Indian paint-
ing and Japanese pottery.
Barry Stern began collecting at the
age of 17, with a Margaret Olley at
20 guineas (“I wouldn’t buy it today”).
He sold a Kmit and three Passmores,
wrote reviews of art for the “Jewish
News,” and in 1961 opened up a gal-
lery in Paddington (“Everyone told me
I’d only make the basic wage, but I
haven’t looked back since”). He sold
his own painting collection, earning
enough from this to buy more; he
shows Pro Hart, David Boyd, and
many other artists, and again doesn’t
bother to have painters on contract,
chiefly because he feels it would be
pointless, as artists have a habit of
breaking agreements. Much of his
money comes not from the gallery itself
but from private deals arranged across
expensive dinner tables, and he is a
gifted salesman.
In Melbourne, galleries usually have
reciprocal arrangements with Sydney,
so that artists showing at, say, Terry
Clune would also show at the South
Yarra. The South Yarra is run by Mrs.
Robert Dulieu, probably the doyenne
of Melbourne dealers, whose career
typically started with private collection
and work in the direction of the
Museum of Modern Art before, seven
years ago, she started up her elegant
modern gallery. She regularly shows
painters like Percival, Louis James,
James Gleeson, John Olsen. Unlike her
Sydney counterparts, she does not com-
plain of artists switching stables.
Also in Melbourne is the Leveson
Street Gallery with three directors,
June Davies, Phil Waterhouse, and
Charles Bush, who exhibits and sells
from this gallery. The Strines Gallery
in Carlton was set up by Sweeney Reed
to show younger and lesser known
painters when the Museum of Modern
Art closed. He deals also in paintings
by well-known figures, and at present
has a 1945 Nolan and a Tucker for
sale.
Among the dealers who go beyond
mere trading, as well as those already
mentioned, are Frank Watters, of the
Watters Gallery in Sydney, and Max
Hutchinson, of Gallery A. (The Central
Street Gallery, financed by an artists’
co-operative and specialising in hard-
edge, also has high aims.) Watters and
Hutchinson are concerned with helping
younger artists to get a fair showing:
Hutchinson, for instance, ploughs back
Terry Clune (left) and Frank McDonald
Kym Bonython


all his profits into new exhibitions of
the lesser-known. A furniture designer,
he helped to develop an interest in non-
figurative art in Melbourne when the
Antipodeans reigned supreme, and in
1963 opened his beautiful gallery in
Sydney in an old police post.
Watters is supported by a partner
who owns the Watters Gallery in Pad-
dington; the gallery opened in 1964.
A former painter himself, Watters fre-
quently shows daringly avante-garde
shows which seldom attract the rich
collectors, who look mainly for slightly
safer works, but they do draw the
more adventurous buyers. He has lost
money on many shows, but is excited
by the stimulus of showing untried
people. Painters even use the gallery
as a studio when it is closed in the
summer months, and Watters, exhausted
by dinner-time talks with clients, takes
off for a long holiday in the head,
“floating on a rubber tube in the
Hunter.”
Watters, like other dealers, complains
of the fact that jealousy between dealer
and dealer is common, that frequent
attempts are made to poach an artist.
Kym Bonython said: “The Marlborough
people in London think it’s deplorable
that gallery owners try to belittle each
other here, while in England they’re
just amicable competitors. One report
came to me through my wife’s hair-
dresser. A dealer in Sydney was sup-
posed to have said: ‘Don’t buy any-
thing from Kym Bonython, you’ll never
get your money back.’ And, ‘Don’t stay
with Bonython, he’s got incurable can-
cer and only 18 months to live.’ ”
(Barry Stern said: “Whatever happens,
Mr. Higham, I want you to be abso-
lutely certain to print the statement
that I did not say Kym Bonython had
incurable cancer and only had 18
months to live.”)
“I feel,” Kym Bonython added,
“somewhat out of my depth in the
Sydney rat race. I’m inclined to be
enthusiastic, but not to the extent of
a well-known dealer who spent his day
outside Raymond Burr’s hotel room
when he was here buying art and
waited to get at him. Maybe that’s
how you get to be a millionaire, but
I’d rather die a pauper than operate
at that kind of pressure.”
Painters seemed equally tough, if the
descriptions of several dealers are to be
believed. They often argue over the
hanging of paintings, play one gallery
against another, become envious of each
other’s prices, and switch galleries with-
out turning a hair and regardless of
help given in the past. (“They are
honest and decent toward their work,
and that’s as far as it goes,” one
embittered dealer told me.)
Critics get short shrift from both
dealers and artists; one gallery has even
closed its doors to Wallace Thornton.
According to more than one dealer,
if a critic pans an exhibition, it will
sell better; most claim that if an exhi-
bition is followed by good reviews, and
the public buys the paintings, it is
merely a coincidence. John Bracken-
reg, of The Art Lovers’ Gallery, said:
“Critics’ reviews only affect the sales
of paintings where the uninformed are
concerned. Some people buy with their
ears instead of their eyes, unfortu-
nately.”
One gets the uncomfortable feeling,
after talking to most dealers, that
aesthetic standards, and critical judg-
ments, are becoming to some extent
irrelevant in a business that turns gal-
leries into picture shops in very little
time. And an equally disturbing sense
that, in the absence of a really influen-
tial saleroom like Sotheby’s, prices of
paintings are accidental, that the whole
structure of values in paintings here
is a flimsy paper pyramid. This goes
for older paintings, too. Whereas ip.
London, Christie’s or Sotheby’s lists
could quickly give you a value on, say,
a Gainsborough, here you have to base
your sense of the value of a von Guer-
ard or a Martens simply on how much
they had changed hands for in the
recent past. (Frank McDonald said:
“If a painting by a little-known Aus-
tralian painter of the past comes up,
you simply pay on its decorative value,
or take a stab.”) He had recently sold
Martens’ works at a much higher price
than hitherto, and hadn’t apparently-
heard a flutter of complaint. In the
absence of registered price lists, it’s
open go for everyone.
McDonald pointed out that the buy-
ing of paintings anywhere can depend
on the buyer’s whim: Tooth’s in Lon-
don had sold a Degas for £lOO,OOO
because the girls in it were smiling,
while another painting by the same
artist had sold for half that amount
because they weren’t. Part of the
puzzle, too, is that Australian prices
have no real international validity:
Robert Hughes, the art critic now liv-
ing in London, writes: “Works of art
by international figures tend to have a
stable price anywhere in the world.
Contrast Australia with this. Four
Olsens, worth collectively $3OOO in Aus-
tralia, could be auctioned at Sotheby’s
at £25 as a job lot. A Dobell would be
likely to fetch £lOO if no Australians
are in the audience; in Aqstralia it
would fetch 100 times that sum. There
are only two or three Australian artists
whose work is salable outside Aus-
tralia. The Australian impact on Lon-
don art is by now a myth.”
Hughes claims that some of our deal-
ers deliberately minimise the value of
European art, and fail to bring it into
this country, because if people saw that
they could buy, say, a 16th-century
Venetian Venus for the price of two
Blackman gouaches they would buy the
Venus: “Here it is to the advantage of
Australian dealers to perpetuate the
isolation of the Australian art scene and
to keep their clients persuaded that
Australian art buys are the best buys.”
Be that as it may, most dealers here
feel we are very far from the peak of
the boom in Australian art, which
Barry Stern believes began with the
Norman Schureck auction in 1963,
when Major Rubin made headlines by
snapping up Australiana for thousands
of pounds. The collectors among
the majors are James Fairfax, Mar-
garet Carnegie, John Lane, Charles
Rich, some of the Myers, Aubrey Gib-
son, David and Gordon Darling, Dick
Sedden, and so on are still paying
prices that Komon, among others,
claims against Hughes are low by world
standards: Clifton Pugh, for example,
hasn’t put up his prices for years. Mc-
Donald believes that, in spite of this,
artists are better off here than in
Europe, England, or America; because
living costs are lower you can get by
on $4O a week, and dealers in those
countries can take anything from 50 to
80 percent; in Paris, everyone agreed,
the position is particularly brutal.
With values rising at the rate of
10 to 15 percent a year, artists and
dealers alike are clearly in for a bonanza
in the next decade, due chiefly to the
interest here of a large group in the
upper middle-class. Frank McDonald
said: “They seem to know nothing
about music or have barely discovered
who Patrick White is. Whereas in
London one would expect them to
know what was on at the various
concerts and to have read the
‘Observer’ and ‘Sunday Times’
thoroughly, there are a lot of people
here who don’t even read the Satur-
day book reviews. But there are a
lot who do know —and that’s to my
great benefit, of course —a bit about
and are interested and excited in Aus-
tralian painting. They don’t know
about overseas art, of course. A
trustee of the Sydney gallery, who’s a
charming man, said to me, ‘Frank,
I’ve just come back from Europe and
I got on to a marvellous guy up there,
and you must get him,’ and I said,
‘Who is he?’ and he said, ‘Modigliani.’
“Epstein bronzes have been sold
here, and there’s a market for Chagall.
People here sometimes buy a picture
for the worst reason—a social reason —
but they end up liking it for a good
one. You get someone coming and say-
ing, ‘I want such and such an artist
because Mrs. So and So has one, and
it’s got to be blue, and I couldn’t pos-
sibly have an upright picture,’ and soon
you have them back, and they’re saying,
‘l’m not sure who gives me more, Fair-
weather or Godfrey Miller,’ both very
abstruse painters. And I think, ‘Well,
this is really marvellous, when I think
what you were like when you first came
here.’ So that’s redeeming.
“Eve seen people who bought paint-
ings here with really the Holy Grail
light in their eyes about what pleasure
it has given them. The compulsion to
buy is initially to decorate, of course.
Very few people come in here with a
large sum of money and say, ‘I want a
new intellectual experience.’ But by the
time they’ve bought the fifth picture
they realise that that is what lies behind
a whole compulsion, really.”
Certainly one hopes —rather faintly
—that the present situation suggests
he’s right. Daniel Thomas, curator of
the Art Gallery of N.S.W., has the last
word: “After all, Mr. Higham, Rudy
Komon started as a journalist . . .”


Dravo can design and build the nuclear power plants to light up tomorrow
Dravo Corporation, which con-
structed the world's first commer-
cial nuclear power reactor eleven
years ago, has the staff and ex-
perience necessary to design,
engineer and construct complete
power facilities—both nuclear
and fossil fueled. In fact, services
to the electric power industry
account for over two-thirds of the
engineering performed by Gibbs
& Hill, Inc., a Dravo subsidiary.
which places that firm among the
leaders in power engineering.
Gibbs & Hill's experience with
nuclear energy goes back to the
"Manhattan project” during
World War 11. Later came work
on atomic submarines and re-
search particle accelerators. In
1955, G & H designed Europe's
first operating pressurized-water
nuclear power plant. Since then,
services have been provided on
nuclear power projects valued at
more than a billion dollars, in-
cluding Europe's largest pressur-
ized-water plant near Zurich.
Dravo nuclear engineering
services include national surveys
of power potentials; technical
and economic feasibility studies;
plant design, specification and
construction ; personnel training;

How to keep one-up
on de Gaulle
IF THE British Prime Minister, Mr.
Harold Wilson, is to exploit the possi-
bilities of checkmating General de
Gaulle in the Common Market tussle
lie will have to play a long, cool game
and he will have to be ready for any
number of humiliating tactical rebuffs.
His greatest immediate danger is that
he will be hustled by an exasperated
Party and public demanding that
Britain either get in or pull out.
Already Labor backbenchers are casti-
gating the Government for belly-
crawling. They are frivolously urging
the application of a time-limit. But this
would simply enable the French to pro-
crastinate until the British application
lapsed.
For the time being, neither Harold
Wilson nor his Foreign Minister, Mr.
George Brown, show signs of yielding.
The Prime Minister has even armed
liimself against a possible veto by
announcing that he will not take “no”
for an answer. Whitehall is instructed
to take each of the French objections
at its face value and deal with it
accordingly. The aim would be to
smoke out the French, forcing them
either to declare their political intransi-
gence and face the consequences or to
give in.
But by far the hardest problem for
the British is to combine the long-term
need to stay the course with the short-
term pressures for tactical advantages.
It was partly to appease impatient
Party opinion and partly to encourage
German Chancellor Kiesinger to stand
up to de Gaulle that Mr. Wilson let it
be known that the Germans should not
take Britain too much for granted. It
might seem a shame to forgo the
obviously strong negotiating assets,
notably of Britain’s military presence
in Germany, but the Government’s best
chance of beating General de Gaulle
in the long-term battle for Europe,
which is fundamentally far more im-
portant than the immediate scramble
into the Common Market, is to con-
vince all its partners, including France,
that Britain is irrevocably committed.
Meanwhile, there is plenty to do in
order to make the country internation-
ally more competitive, which is essen-
tial whether or not Britain joins. There
is also wide scope for action bringing
British taxation, welfare, industrial, and
agricultural policies more into line with
those of Britain’s prospective European
partners, so that when the time for
entry comes the jerk will not be too
brutal. ,
But, in the meantime, it is clear that
the more patently the General obstructs
Wilson, Kiesinger, and Brown ... “Germany shouldn’t take Britain for granted”
Britain’s efforts to join, the more reluc-
tant he will find his partners to proceed
with tightening the political and econo-
mic links among themselves.
From this point of view—the preven-
tion of the emergence of a Continental
bloc closed to Britain, which could be
politically and economically catastrophic
to it the British application has
already paid off.
U.S. Congress
In revolt
PRESIDENT JOHNSON is said to
derive some comfort from the reflection
that even George Washington and
Abraham Lincoln had to fight wars
with one eye on their rebels at home.
Certainly today the view of the Capi-
tol from the White House is one of
sudden uproar and defiance. As Mr.
Johnson’s popularity has ebbed, leaders
even of his own Party have struck
out on their own, while the heartened
Republicans have resurrected their
alliance with conservative Democrats.
In the Senate the breach has come
over tariff policy: five members of the
Cabinet were thrown into the battle
before the Finance Committee to stem
a protectionist tide that was sweeping
almost every Senator along.
If all the Bills which they are spon-
soring were to pass, nearly two-fifths
of America’s imports would be re-
duced drastically, while retaliation
from abroad could wreak even greater
havoc on America’s exports, starting
with farm products. For the moment
the danger seems to be receding. There
have been sober second thoughts in
the Senate about the wisdom of attach-
ing a protectionist rider to the social
security Bill (the Senate cannot origi-
nate tariff legislation) and no other
suitable vehicle is in sight. Moreover,
there are clear hints that a presidential
veto awaits any protectionist legislation.
Yet it is to the Senate that the Presi-
dent has had to look to tame the
extravagances of the House of Repre-
sentatives extravagances of economy,
that is. In one wild session the House
voted first to forbid federal agencies
to spend more than they did during
the past fiscal year (with certain excep-
tions); then to limit total spending to
$U.5.131.5 billion, apart from any
necessary increases in expenditures on
the war. All were attached to a routine
but essential measure permitting fed-
eral agencies which have not received
their appropriations for the current year
to continue spending money. The exact


effect is impossible to calculate, but the
reduction demanded in civilian spending
is put at between SU.S.S billion and
$U.5.8.7 billion, with a third of the fin-
ancial year nearly over and most mem-
bers well aware that cuts are possible
in only about $2O billion of the Gov-
ernment’s annual spending.
Sober members were shocked by
this irresponsibility. It is one thing to
demand some economy before taxes
are increased (though in the mood of
the House it seems increasingly doubt-
ful whether the most stringent economy
will lead to a tax increase this year).
But the House has shown no evidence
itself of a will to economise; it is play-
ing to the gallery back home, where
economy is as popular as higher taxes
are disliked. The President has always
insisted that he would submit cuts when
Congress completed its work on ap-
propriation Bills. But now conserva-
tives are openly gleeful at the thought
that the President may have to gut
his own social programs, as well as
foreign aid. Fortunately Senators, two-
thirds of whom are not up for election
next year, are less vulnerable to the
economy virus, though not quite im-
mune; last week they beat off. two
schemes requiring Budget cuts, though
to secure the agreement of the House
concessions seem inevitable. It has
been a harsh ordeal for a President
whose reputation for astute political
management once stood so high.
India
Never so good
AFTER FIVE YEARS of drought and
shortage, Indian farmers will perhaps
reap a record summer harvest this year
surpassing the 95-million-ton target.
The annual food imports of ten million
tons will be halved. Prices have already
started to drop as rice from the eastern
provinces comes into the market. Prices
are even falling in States like West
Bengal, with a perennial rice deficit.
During the past six weeks the price of
millet dropped by 20 percent in the
plains of Northern India and maize by
almost 25 percent. Influenced by this,
rice prices have also fallen slightly.
According to the latest estimates
(made after the harvest had already
started in most States) this year’s
figure is up by at least 26 percent over
last year’s disastrous drought harvest,
and if the monsoon does not let the
country down as badly as it has done
in the past two years, India should
achieve complete food self-sufficiency
by 1970. The per acre yield of many
crops has doubled. India’s Food Min-
ister, Jagjivan Ram, said recently that
India’s food position is improving “day
by day.” He added there was absolutely
no chance of a repeat of the crisis which
has confronted India during the past
two years.
His confidence was not based solely
on astrological prophesies concerning
the rain god’s future performance.
Much of the past work in the way of
providing irrigation, fertilisers, and
other farm inputs is now starting to pay
off. During 1966-67 alone, three mil-
lion acres were brought under irriga-
tion and a further 3.5 million acres
have been added during the current
fiscal year. Although a lot more
remains to be done, the element of
risk and uncertainty has been con-
siderably reduced.
Far more impressive is the work done
in the field of introducing improved
varieties. The High Yielding Varieties
Program (HYP) has been introduced
in 6.6 million acres and this will cover
16.23 million acres by the end of the
current fiscal year. If all goes .well,
this alone could add another 12 mil-
lion tons to India’s total food produc-
tion. This apart, the improved variety
programs organised by hundreds of
research and extension organisations
should introduce better seeds in over a
hundred million acres in different
regions this year. Significant break-
Mrs. Gandhi... a harvest to smile
about
throughs have also been made in plant
protection an important aspect of
farming largely ignored in India until
recently. About 63 million acres were
treated with pesticides last year and
substantially more this year: the figure
will possibly be doubled by next year.
Increased irrigation and the use of
quick-germinating varieties have brought
more areas under double cropping
where only one crop was harvested for
centuries. In 1967-68 alone 7.5 million
acres will be brought under double
cropping.
Although it is difficult to break away
from the prevailing mood of scarcity
that has engulfed the nation for the
past five years, and opportunities for
hoarders and speculators are now in-
creased, the assured harvest has made
the Government’s task of procuring
grain much easier than ever before.
Punjab has already offered to procure
an additional 100,000 tons more in her
account, which is currently placed at
361,000 tons. Madras has offered to
supply more rice to Kerala, where the
deficit —even after a record harvest —
will be around a million tons of rice in
the next year. Despite an estimated 12
percent loss, Uttar Pradesh has an
excellent crop this year. In six districts
of Madhya Pradesh the Government
has already relaxed its restrictions on
the movement of rice and further re-
laxations will follow soon. The process
of unwinding the tight curbs imposed
during scarcity has already begun. If
this produces a healthy response from
the peasants by bringing more stocks
into the market, the present state of
mind governed by scarcity will also be
overcome soon.

Economic Review," Hong Kong)
Iran
Peacock splendor
NOW ONLY THE Vatican or West-
minster can compete with the un»
abashed splendor of Tehran. The
morning of the Shah’s coronation was
a morning of dazzling jewels that really
were as big as pigeons’ eggs, of
innumerable diamonds, of heavy robes
encrusted with gold and pearl, of curved
swords held high in the air at the
salute. It was Byzantine in its remote
magnificence; it was heavily military;
it was the sort of occasion which when
it happens causes people to say that it
can never happen again.
Mohammad Reza Pahlavi has been
Shahanshah (King of Kings) for 26
years, and some mystery attends the
fact that he chose only 18 months ago
to stage this lavish memorial. It is
probably that he was signalling the
achievement to his people and to the
world that Iran has moved into calm
political waters, that she is on the brink
of real economic change with a growth
rate of 9 percent a year.
He rode out of his marble palace—
a building that would pass unremarked
in some other capitals—in a brand-new
golden coach made in Vienna, drawn
by six white horses whose harness came
from England. First came a battalion of
his guards swinging their arms high and
digging their heels in behind their
colors. Then a squadron of lancers.
Then this graceful casket slung between
four wheels with walls of glass and a
replica of his crown on its roof. In
military uniform, he sat beside his
wife, whose long-necked beauty added
to the slightly Hollywood air of the
whole thing.
And then in a second coach came
the crown. This was violin-brown and

gold and the seven-year-old Crown
Prince sat alone in the back seat dressed
as a field-marshal, sashed, with a gold
chain round his neck. He is wide-eyed
and looked like a rather naughty boy
on his best behaviour—or else. Some-
times he waved, sometimes he saluted,
sometimes he pressed up against the
window to stare out like any child in a
railway train.
They moved at a walking pace
through a city that had been decorated
in the manner of a country fair but on
an infinite scale. There were vast gaudy
crowns, millions of electric bulbs, new
fountains, triumphal arches made of
hardboard, an open space ringed with
300 glass chandeliers, beflagged every-
where with the green, white, and red
of Iran.
The crowds were enormous, mostly
male and young, and most of them
shabbily dressed. They cheered and
clapped and in places were nearly out
of control, trampling down young trees
as they surged forward. A few women
set up the high ululation of the Moslem
world. Bands played and whole bat-
talions drawn up in close order saluted
and the procession made its way to the
Golestan Palace.
This was built by the somewhat
degenerate previous dynasty about a
hundred years ago. It is a confection
of enchanting vulgarity, set in a tradi-
tional Persian garden. It is used now
only for ceremonial occasions. Inside
in a white-and-gold room, lit by heavy
chandeliers, the Government, the
notables, the diplomats, and the Press
were ranged in tiers on either side. The
women wore pastel dresses down to the
ground (the regulations were explicit),
the men were in uniform or in white
tie and tails. The Soviet Ambassador
with his sash and dangling medals
looked almost Congress-of-Vienna, so
did the British Ambassador, Sir Denis
Wright. Even the photographers wore
dark suits.
At the end in a richly decorated
alcove stood the Peacock Throne, which
is usually kept in the vaults of a bank.
It is encrusted with precious stones and
has a high, awkward step leading up to
its quite astonishing ugliness. It is part
of the fabulous collection of royal jewels
which are the Iranian equivalent of
Fort Knox.
Then began a series of solemn pro-
cessions down the aisle toward the
throne. The Crown Prince came first,
guarded by officers with drawn swords.
He was chivvied a little by a chamber-
lain to keep up and then stood in front
of a chair on the left of the throne.
Then came the Queen, utterly com-
posed, in a long, white medieval dress
with a great train behind her and more
sword-bearing generals. She was wear-
ing a necklace and earrings of incredibly
large rubies. And then the Shah came
in, all at a slow and funereal pace. A
choir sang and it sounded as it looked —
In Tehran gaudy crowns... “shaped
like a wastepaper basket”
a ceremony at the Court of Imperial
Russia.
The Shah stood in front of the throne
while soldiers brought in the imperial
regalia on tasselled cushions. He listened
to the prayers of a black-robed imam
and kissed the sacred Koran. He
buckled on a rich sword-belt and a
sword, knobbly with gems. They put a
gold-and-blue cloak round his shoulders
and then they offered him the crown.
There were some 600 people watch-
ing in the blaze of television lights and
the steadily increasing splendor of
jewellery. The crown is shaped rather
like a wastepaper basket, with a tall
plume at its front. It weighs nearly
three kilos. He took it and carefully
set it on his own head. All hell broke
loose. Guns fired, bells rang, trumpets
sounded, people shouted acclamations
and a nationwide celebration began.
The Shah sat hieratic on his throne
with a great baton in his hand and
almost merged into his jewelled back-
ground. He sat still but his eyes were
darting while the Prime Minister and
the Head of the Diplomatic Corps read
their congratulations. A man in an
academic gown chanted an ode to him,
the Shah made a speech to the nation,
and then, swords still at the salute
around him, cloaked and crowned, he
moved slowly out of the chamber. The
Queen followed with her six ladies to
hold up her robe, and last went the
Crown Prince, ignoring the bows and
the curtsies that bent the audience as
the wind does a cornfield.
The three separate groups, each with
its splendid escort, moved out of the
palace and down into the garden
toward the carriages. This is a place of
water and fountains and geometrical
beds of roses and shady trees. They
stalked slowly along the path. Trum-
pets sounded, an orchestra played.
They blazed with color and points of
light. Stiff, solemn, severe, round the
town they went, sitting like benign idols
in their coach, so splendid a sight that
it stilled criticism. There are few
rulers in the world who can count on
the sort of enthusiasm that greeted this
strange sight.

"Sham democracy"
By HARVEY STOCKWIN
SENATOR RAUL MANGLAPUS,
who will be remembered for his Dya-
son lectures in Australia in 1966, is
quitting politics or, more accurately,
will soon become an ex-Senator. In this
year’s Senatorial elections in the Philip-
pines he is not running for re-election.
The Liberal Party offered him a berth
on their official slate, but he declined,
the offer. Similarly, he turned down
President Marcos’ offer of the Am-
bassadorship to the United States. Why,
and for what, he is going into the
wilderness well illustrates the current
state of the Filipino nation.
Manglapus no longer believes that
politics, as presently played and prac-
tised in the Philippines, can provide
an answer to the revolutionary situation
which is slowly building up. Just as
the population is increasing very fast
(three percent is the official figure, but
several highly informed sources suggest
four percent is more accurate), so social
injustice is failing to diminish. Mangla-
pus sees Filipino democracy as basically
a sham, in which two parties ostensibly
compete for popular support, but, in
reality, are mainly concerned to defend
and extend the interests of the small,
wealthy elite. Hence the absence of
any meaningful ideology in either party,
' the lack of purposeful planning for
economic growth, the ad hoc govern-
ment of the country by the Establish-
ment for the (greater profit of)
Establishment.
Why not a third party, then, to
remedy the situation? Manglapus has
tried and failed. In 1965 he himself ran
for President as a candidate of the Party
for Philippine Progress (PPP) and came
a bad third. “As I got less than 500,000
votes,” he tojd me, “I did not even
have the right to protest that not all
my votes were counted.” And, as he
told a Manila Rotary audience last
week: “After the elections people from
Senator Manglapus... out but not down

right here in Manila would come to tell
us, ‘We are 15 in our household, we all
voted for you in one precinct. The final
count gave you only three votes. What
happened?’ ”
From Manglapus’ viewpoint the
democratic “rules” in the Philippines
are so contrived as to perpetuate the
status quo and make third parties im-
possible. The obstacle which cannot be
scaled is the “inspector system.” Only
the Liberal and Nacionalista Parties can
have inspectors at the vote count. Since
the rule states that only the two parties
with the most votes can have inspectors,
the inspectors see to it that only Liberal
and Nacionalista votes are thoroughly
counted.
Prior to his Rotary speech last week,
many thoughtful Filipinos were wonder-
ing if his quitting politics indicated
too much conscience, too little com-
promise, a preference for ideology over
practice, for the intellectual ivory tower
rather than the very dusty Filipino
arena. Manglapus at least set these
doubts to rest. Acknowledging that com’
promise and corruption were seldorri
absent from politics, he maintained that
“compromise and corruption within a
vacuum of ideology is an incurable
cancer . . . This vacuum ... is the
most fatal malady of all . . . it results
in a people going through the motions
of democracy, but getting nowhere . . .
fundamental and organised solutions are
never reached ... it is this caricature
of democracy that I shun, not the daily
routine of compromise and corruption.”
For those wondering if he had an
answer, Manglapus raised the question,
“Can the system perhaps be surrounded,
encircled, and pressed from the outside
with such force that it will have to
change itself?”
He then proceeded to answer it with
an emphatic “yes” by revealing the
manifesto of a new Christian Social
Movement “to unite our country into a
compact, vigorous, and organic body
politic” and “to solidify a block of votes
so formidable that government execu-
tives and legislators will not reject their
demand for ideological direction in this
republic.”
The manifesto which did not
have the advantages of brevity or sim-
plicity called for a Christian
/Humanist Society and stressed, among
other things, wealth and property
imposing duties rather than privileges;
the greater use of redistributive taxa-
tion; a “militant nationalism” to be
asserted against “colonialists” within as
well as without; a “communitarian sys-
tem of production and consumption”
as against collectivist solutions; “dis-
tributive justice” between nations as
well as within them. In a country which
is 80 percent Catholic, the movement
could be a means to rally and organise
the progressive sections of the Church
and other organisations. As one diplo-
mat pointed out to me “If the
Church cannot be the means for effec-

tive and radical change here, what hope
is there?” At the time we were dis-
cussing the report of a Senate commit-
tee, chaired by Manglapus’ PPP col-
league Senator Manahan, which re-
cently revealed the presence of an
“invisible government” in the areas of
Central Luzon, long the sanctuary of
the Philippine Communists, the Huks.
Has Manglapus found a relevant
answer? In a country which, according
to one Filipino banker, suffers from
“diarrhoea in words, constipation in
action,” the words of the manifesto
will ultimately be less important than
the organisation of the Movement.
Amidst the ever-present reminders of
conspicuous consumption by the Fili-
pino few, the eternal politicking which
leaves little time for constructive
achievement, there can be little doubt
that the ideas Manglapus espouses are
in the right context.
For some critics these ideas can
only appeal to the urban intellectuals,
not to the rural masses; for others it
remains true that change in “the sys-
tem” can only come from within, not
from outside pressure; that Manglapus
is too concerned with the philosophi-
cal not the practical, and that his
movement will only serve as a John
the Baptist to a communist Christ.
Time will give the answers, but, as
Manglapus is acutely aware, time is
not on his side. In his Rotary speech
he noted the view of the outgoing
Apostolic Nuncio to the Philippines
that “in the disparity of vvealth and in
the conditions of society the same symp-
toms of revolution (exist) as those in
pre-Castro Cuba.” He also pointed out
that the humanism his Christian Social
Movement espouses enjoyed a vogue of
only three months in Castro Cuba be-
fore Communism attained ascendancy.
Manglapus, who made such an im-
pact on Australian audiences with his
theme of Australia and the Asian revo-
lution, is, at the very least, trying very
hard to create the better kind of revo-
lution for his own country. Mangla-
pus has quit political office, but he
hasn’t given up the fight.
China
The long truancy
AFTER A LONG, long vacation lasting
nearly a year and a half, during which
Chinese schools and universities were
either shut down or ravaged by warring
factions of Red Guards, the official
Peking “People’s Daily” was still plead-
ing last week for the young to return
to their lessons. Students were first
ordered back to their desks eight
months ago.
Chinese children began their ex-
tended holiday in mid-1966, when it
was announced that all schools would
close “for six months” while educa-
tional methods were drastically over-
hauled.
Under the existing “pernicious”
system, it was stressed, students were
selected and advanced purely “on the
basis of their intelligence and their
success in school.” The consequent
“domination by bourgeois intellectuals”
must end. Candidates for school and
university must in future be judged
primarily by their class background
and revolutionary consciousness. Pref-
erence should be given to the sons of
peasants, workers, soldiers, and prole-
tarian cadres.
For 14 delirious months the Red
Guards, armed with Mao’s little red
book as their passport, have long-
marched through China or ridden free
on the railways, bent on a revolu-
tionary rumpus.
In February the Government finally
banned all this travel and announced
that the schools would reopen; students
were encouraged, however, to “seize
power” from capitalistic school
authorities and replace them with
joint “revolutionary school councils.”
But Red Guards still on the rampage,
unimpressed by this sop to their rebel
spirit, simply defied the Government
and continued to play truant. Those
who returned to the classroom spent
most of the time singing revolutionary
songs and chanting quotations from
Mao there were no new primers to
replace the discredited “bourgeois”
textbooks, in any case.
The situation has been complicated
throughout by the nervousness of
teachers who were earlier damned as
“rightists” by yelling mobs of their
own students and sometimes forced
out of their lecture-rooms to sweep
out the corridors or clean the lav-
atories. Many were too frightened to
return to teach the same classes. Others
stood speechless as unruly gangs of
pupils pitched into each other.
Peking is now trying to pull a dis-
rupted Chinese society together by re-
conciling the revolutionary rebels with
the bureaucracy they were only yester-
day encouraged to denounce. “The
overwhelming majority of our cadres
are good,” the Press now claims.
The realisation that the country
needs its cadres emphasises the appal-
ling magnitude of the sacrifice China
has made. Peking has lost a scholastic
year and more, during which nearly a
million students should have attended
university and four million more should
have studied in secondary school.
Furthermore, it was disclosed last
week that in a typical secondary school
three periods out of five are now re-
served for study of Mao’s works and
for “revolutionary criticism.” In the
Peking Aviation Academy the study
of Mao’s works of the cultural revolu-
tion and communist affairs leaves only
12 out of the week’s 54 teaching hours
free for other subjects, and six of
these are then devoted to problems of
industrial and agricultural output or
to military instruction.


BUSINESS AND FINANCE
No veto for Britain’s EEC
entry, but...
NO VETO, yet. That was one small
crumb of comfort left to the British
after M. Couve de Murville had
devoured their application to join the
Common Market at its council of minis-
ters’ meeting at Luxemburg last week.
The other was the attitude of the Five.
The Dutch, did not confirm pre-
conference suspicions that they were
weakening, and, more notably, the Ger-
man delegation, headed by Herr Willy
Brandt, was patently less frightened of
offending France than the German
Chancellor seems to be.
But that was it. M. Couve’s obstacles
to British entry were massive. No objec-
tion in principle, he said; no objection
even to negotiations, but before they
start the Six must agree together that
the conditions are ripe for a successful
outcome. And the conditions he stated
could have been designed to ensure that
no such agreement is possible. Britain’s
economy must be strong and its pound
solid before negotiations can even begin,
and the pound must be reduced to a
purely national role by the time Britain
finally comes in.
If that were not enough, the French
hammer at the point that the entry of
four new countries and their extra-
continental links, plus the likely asso-
ciation of yet more countries, will
change the nature, aims, and cohesion
of the community. In the fog that
Couve de Murville... negative
shrouded the upper stories of Luxem-
burg’s glassy new European centre, M.
Couve detected the faint outline of an
Atlantic free trade area.
The issue of procedure, whether to
negotiate or not, could bring the Six to
their first test of nerves within weeks.
They escaped one last week only by
agreeing, apparently painlessly, to dis-
agree about the fundamental effects of
enlarging the community there is a
certain air of resignation about M.
Couve’s crystal-gazing—and by adjourn-
ing discussion of the immediate issues
raised by British entry to November 20.
Meanwhile, the foreign ministers’ per-
manent representatives in Brussels have
been instructed to get to work on clari-
fying the issues: something one supposed
Mr. Jean Rey’s European Commission
in Brussels had done already.
But this stage of the discussion cannot
go on for ever. The German compro-
mise that might have enabled it to do
so—the device of holding “talks about
talks” —has fallen by the wayside. The
Five have apparently decided that they
cannot sensibly discuss the substantive
issues—the pound, the economy, agri-
culture, the Commonwealth without
having Britain’s views: and that this
can be done only in negotiations. If the
Five’s nerve holds, France will have to
decide within one or two meetings of
the council of ministers whether to veto
the start of negotiations or not.
Things look grey for Britain, but they
could well have looked black. Though,
from the Continent, it is obvious that
Mr. Wilson and Lord Chalfont must
have their smiles permanently taped
on, they may well argue that their
tactics of shove, shove, shove have
worked. Yet one wonders. British warn-
ings that they, too, can play it rough
may, perhaps, have had something to
do with Herr Brandt’s remark that if
there were risks in saying yes to Britain
there were also great risks in saying no.
But if the Five are even half-ready to
risk a crisis (and who thinks Herr
Kiesinger is?) it is probably more
thanks to French behaviour than to
British tactics.
Mr. Luns, of Holland, was clearly
infuriated by M. Couve’s essentially
negative attitude. And both Herr
Brandt and Signor Fanfani pointed out
forcibly to the French guardians of the
Rome Treaty that the treaty does not
permit neutrality between admitting or
not admitting a European power to the
European community. As for extra-
continental links, some countries, said
Herr Brandt, had brought their African
problems with them into Europe.
But among community officials, cer-
tainly not all Gaullists, it is quite com-
monly felt that the British, with all
their fuss and bluster, are overplaying
their hand. The British, it is thought,
have just not got the strength to force
their way instantly into Europe like
this. Lord Chalfont has been told as
much. The British error in blasting the
French members of the European Com-
mission for the commission’s unfavor-
able report on the British economy was
not just one of public relations but of
fact. The British are so ready to see a
French plot behind any description of
the problems their entry would pose,
say the men who would have to deal
with the results, that they do not under-
stand that these problems, however mis-
used by the French, are very serious
ones.
No member of the commission takes
as extreme a view as does the French
Government of the extent Britain’s
economy must recover before anything
can move. But community officials cer
tainly see Britain’s economic weakness
as a potential danger. They see real
difficulties in the reserve role of sterling
for the common monetary policy which
the community is slowly tending
toward. They see that enlarging the
community could—though it need not —
import a real risk of weakness or delay.
On the evidence of Luxemburg, these
officials are gloomier, or franker, than
Britain’s political friends. But their
reaction demonstrates how much better
Britain’s chances would be, as it urges
its allies over the top on its behalf, if
it had something harder than optimistic
speeches to fire in their support.
Transport
A national plan
IT IS PRETTY old hat, but nonethe-
less sound economics, to keep complain-
ing about the limitations State Govern-
ments put on intrastate road hauliers
in. the interest of keeping somewhat
redundant rail services viable and pay-
ing interest on the huge sums sunk in
them in days before most of us were
born. Mr. William Kirkhope, senior
partner in Hungerford, Spooner &
Kirkhope, and more relevantly, in this
context, chairman of Mayne Nickless,
was at it again last week advocating a
national transport plan to get rid of the


intrastate restrictions and pointing out
poignantly from his company’s view-
point that a firm could ply between
Melbourne and Port Hedland without
permit or restriction, but not from Mel-
bourne to Bendigo or from Sydney to
Newcastle. The latter restrictions were
in defiance of the natural advantages
of road transport in the short- and
medium-distance haul fields, and the
country was paying dearly for them.
State road taxes are playing merry
hell with the direction of the road haul-
age business in various parts of Aus-
tralia, but hauliers are not always in
a position to take diversionary action,
such as those in Western Queensland
who late last year decided to haul wool
all the way to Sydney instead of Bris-
bane, so saving graziers 1\ percent in
haulage costs even though the journey
to Sydney took half as long again as
the shorter one to Brisbane.
This is the sort of absurd situation
the Commonwealth Bureau of Roads,
which set up shop in March last year,
should be looking into and getting the
Federal Government to do something
about in conjunction with the States.
The Bureau has so far been mighty
quiet about what, if anything, it is doing
to give answers on the co-ordination of
national road transport. Perhaps, after
all, the forecast of one MP at the time
of its creation that it would be a
“toothless and nebulous” organisation
is to prove pretty accurate, though the
chairman, Mr. T. Loxton, did warn
last year that it would be “some time”
before it made any recommendations to
the Government.
Pensions
Dynamic funds
Mr. David Parsons, the Federal secre-
tary of the Association of Superannua-
tion and Provident Funds of Australia,
at its annual meeting in Melbourne
suggested the establishment of “short-
term dynamic pension funds.” The
funds would be contributory and all
employees would join as a condition
of service from, say, age 35. The benefit
would be a pension based on the average
last three years’ final salary, with a
right of commutation up to, say, one-
third the value of the pension and the
pension would include a cost of living
adjustment. The benefit would be de-
signed to supplement and integrate
with a national pension scheme. There
would be a retirement age of 65 for both
women and men, but provision would
be included for early and late retire-
ment. There would be separate depen-
dants’ benefits for death in service
which would cover all employees from
date of joining the service of the
employer.
Mr. Parsons suggested that such a
fund would interest both employer and
employees, and that both would con-
sider increased contributions (compared
to current levels of contributions) over
the shorter period to provide an
adequate benefit. There would be little
opposition to full vesting and full
portability conditions for the reason
that from age 35 a relatively few em-
ployees consider transfer of employ-
ment. A flexible investment policy
would increase yields and this could be
undertaken if the present 30/20 legis-
lation was abolished.
Mr. Parsons also suggested that the
Government could consider the estab-
lishment of a contributory national
pension scheme which would provide
a known amount, subject to cost-of-
living adjustment at age 65 for women
and men. The fact that private funds
would not require contributions from
either employers or employees before
age 35 to 40 would provide a basis for
a reducing scale of contributions to the
national scheme and also the option that
employers who establish private
schemes may contract out of the
national scheme. Mr. Parsons’ sugges-
tions seem worthy of study at the
highest Government level.
Offshore oil
Wheeling, dealing
SHORTLY ALTER THE Eederal
Government announced in December,
1965, that it was to apply the graticular
sale principle for off-shore oil search,
Mr. J. H. Hamlin, manager of Esso,
which in partnership with BHP had
made its first Bass Strait discovery
earlier the same year, told The Bulletin
that it was monstrous for the Govern-
ment to change the search rules after
the game had started. There were
some good grounds for his complaint.
Under this principle, the Esso-BHP
group would have been obliged to select
five-ninths of its discovery permit area
for its own exploitation and hand over
the remainder for auctioning, with itself
having the right to buy it at the price
of the highest bidder. This principle
has been adopted in some other coun-
tries, including Canada, where Hamlin
comes from, but here the Government
had not thought it necessary to set any
rules. In mounting its massive expendi-
ture on the Bass Strait search, Esso-BHP
had, perhaps unwisely, taken it for
granted that, after a discovery had been
made, it could proceed to develop the
whole of the relevant permit area sub-
ject only to State mining laws, notably
in respect to royalties.
Whether the graticular principle is a
good one or not (Mr. Hamlin thinks
not, even though his native country has
adopted it), it has been sacrificed on
the anvil of political opportunism and
weighty lobbying, which would seem a
strange mixture in the concoction of
legislation on this particular matter,
even if not in the general run of things.
The simple fact of it is that Sir Henry
Esso’s J. H. Hamlin... “monstrous”
Bolte wanted a bigger royalty cut from
Esso-BHP and, with special encourage-
ment from that group seeing the aban-
donment of the graticular principle as
the price, managed to persuade the
Eederal Government, albeit against
strong objections from other States, to
get it for him. So, wheeling and deal-
ing have really decided the legislation.
What is more, even though the Victorian
Premier has contracted in an annex to
the Eederal-State agreement not to dis-
criminate against interstate trade in oil
and gas, his own interpretation of this
is that it is a double-edged sword
because it would be discrimination, in
his view, if N.S.W. was to get cheaper
gas from Bass Strait than Victoria,
something he is determined to prevent
at all costs.
Companies
Name changers
WHAT’S IN A NAME! When Vic-
torian Antimony Mines Ltd. changed
its name to VAM Ltd. in April, 1963,
hardly anybody noticed. At the time
it really didn’t seem to make so much
difference except that, by that time,
although the company’s registered office
was (and still is) in Victoria, all its
directors lived in N.S.W., and most of
its affairs appeared to relate to mining
properties and propositions in that
State. Lrom its inception in 1952, to
rejuvenate old antimony workings
around Costerfield, in Victoria, its in-
terests have widened far afield. But it
has never paid a dividend on its shares,
which at present number 1,274,850 in
50-cent units. The latter have been a
mere 37 cents at their lowest this year;
they have recently sprouted wings as
rumors of various deals, notably with
Delhi Australian Petroleum . for a


minerals lease in W.A. and also of “a
hig overseas buyer” in the market, have
been wafted around, taking the shares
up beyond the $2 mark. This oblique
but lively shell of the nickel boom is
■certainly making a name for itself with
its Very Amorphous Mix. But will it
•eventually hatch?
A few other companies have also
Been going into the name-changing busi-
ness recently, such as Dunlop Rubber,
'which is dropping the “Rubber” from
its title. This seems a bit silly after all
these years, despite its wide diversifica-
tion outside rubber products. Anyhow,
people had got quite fond of it, and
may get more so as the company con-
firms its recent improvement.
Another to change is Metropolitan
Dairies to Consolidated Foods, which
certainly better befits its diversions from
the Melbourne suburban milk rounds.
As for Motels of Australia changing to
TraveLodge, well, that’s a nice name,
which gives a superior status symbol to
the leading group in this field in Aus-
tralia. Thank goodness it hasn’t taken
on a series of initials as its title. There
are far too many of these on the Stock
Exchange lists.
Japan
New defence plan
HITHERTO SUPPLIED with surplus
or obsolete American weapons, Japan
is ordering substantial amounts of mis-
siles, aircraft, tanks, and other arma-
ments from Japanese factories, most of
them manufacturing under licence from
America. During the new five-year pro-
gram, Mitsubishi Heavy Industries will
probably manufacture 311 Nike mis-
siles at £stg.6o,ooo each, and one or
two other Japanese firms will be selec-
ted as prime contractors to produce
665 Hawks at £20,000 each. The total
installed cost of these missiles is esti-
mated at £91.5 million, or about ten
percent of the total expenditure of the
third defence plan. Ground radar and
launching equipment will still come
from the United States under reimburs-
able assistance. The Japanese have
agreed to pay an additional £2.7 mil-
lion as Japan’s share of American mis-
sile research and development costs.
Hardware spending in the year to
March 31, 1968, is expected to total
approximately £155 million, compared
with £lO9 million in 1966. In addition
there is a plum airframe contract to
be awarded for fighters before two years
are out.
Smaller companies, particularly those
firms which were once the backbone of
Japan’s imperial war machine during
the Pacific war, are also doing well
from increasing defence expenditure.
The Kawasaki Aircraft Company, for
instance, is producing 45 large heli-
copters, 46 anti-submarine reconnais-
sance planes, and 55 small gas-turbine
helicopters. There is a sub-contract
killing to be made in tanks, armored
cars, self-propelled artillery, shells,
machine-guns, rifles, and ammunition.
Under the rearmament program Jap-
anese shipbuilders are to construct two
small helicopter-carrying destroyers, one
missiles-equipped destroyer, eight light
destroyers, and three anti-submarine
destroyers. In addition, the plan calls
for construction of several submarines.
The program will make Japan the third
most powerful naval power in Asia
though still a long way behind the two
biggest, America and the Soviet Union.
Protection
Failure in Congress
AT LEAST TWO very well-qualified
observers are confident that protec-
tionist moves in the U.S. Congress will
not succeed. Mr. Bill Barton, director
of the American firm Business Inter-
national, and his editor, former Aus-
tralian journalist Mr. Ken Gott (now
living in New York), told our Canberra
man last week they thought it “most
unlikely” that many of the protectionist
moves would be successful. They
thought the moves on textiles probably
would, but that the rest would fail.
Both men saw further efforts by pro-
tectionists in the Congress next year
and a continuing struggle on the sub-
ject. The more fuss overseas the better,
since both Barton and Gott, in common
with the American businessmen for
whom they write and research, are
very much biased toward liberalisation.
But they argued that protectionists in
the U.S. feed on protectionists else-
where. At the present time they are
feeding a good deal off Japan’s restric-
tions on foreign capital. Australia was
considered by American businessmen to
be a “high tariff country,” they said,
and, as long as that remained a factor,
our trade negotiators were unlikely to
get a good hearing when asking for a
better go for our primary products in
the U.S. market.
Business International executives
are in Australia at present acting as the
secretariat for a “round table,” a week-
long series of off-the-record meetings
between 60 senior executives of Ameri-
can and international companies and
Australian political and civil service
leaders. Mr. Gott expected that busi-
nessmen would be asking some concen-
trated questions on labor relations.
Foreign firms operating here found
absenteeism and labor turnover more
troublesome than elsewhere and would
be sounding out proposals for a system
of incentives and continuity of bonuses
to overcome these problems.
The new trade practices legislation
was extremely mild by U.S. and Euro-
pean standards, but it would produce
a lot of interest in how it would be
administered and in how it might
evolve. The local “guidelines” on
foreign companies borrowing on the
Australian capital market had caused
“drastic revisions” in the financing
arrangements of American companies
here, and would, therefore, be contro-
versial.
But the main reason for coming here
is that most Americans consider Aus-
tralia, after Japan, to be the most
significant economic power in the Asian
region and therefore wanted to get to
know more about it.
Tyres
Firestones to kill off Hordie
THERE IS NO SUCH thing as a
Hardie tyre any more. The new maj-
ority owners of the Hardie Rubber Co.,
the U.S.-owned Firestone Australia
Pty. Ltd., this week began to manu-
facture its own brand, Firestone, and
decided to kill off the Hardie name
that had been rolling around Australian
roads for 43 years. Firestone acquired
a 70 percent interest in Hardie Rubber
last year from its former owner, the
Australian - owned petrol - marketing
company H. C. Sleigh (which retains
a 30 percent take in it). Firestone also
got 165 United Tyre Service stores in
with the deal (these are now to be
called Firestone stores) and it looks as
if the company, based in Sydney, will
be concentrating more on the replace-
ment market than initial equipment.
The Hardie Rubber Company had
older associations than the company
that bought it but it had not gone
anywhere as far. Firestone, formed only
67 years ago, now has sales of about
$2OOO million a year, while the Hardie
tyre operation, which had its origins
in a gin mill at Rushcutters Bay, in
1824, as the Colonial Rubber Co., had
not been doing very well at all in
recent years, under pressure of severe
competition from the rapidly expand-
ing local manufacturing industry, ris-
ing imports, and a slow-down in new-
car production.
Firestone is up-dating and reorganis-
ing the Hardie operation at a cost of
“many millions of dollars,” according
to its local managing director, 39-year-
old Missouri-born Gordon W. Weber,
The company talks of a $l2 million
improvement scheme and a possible $2O
million ultimate expansion plan for
Australia, if things go well.

Are you holding 8.H.P., Western Mining,
Peko, or Ampol-and getting nervous?
Market action shows what lies ahead for
them. Trendex is pointing it out.
What About 8.H.P.?
No stock goes up forever. From 1956 to 1961 B.H.P. was
rising strongly, and a holder saw the value of his shares in-
crease fivefold. In 1961 we took our portfolio clients out of
B.H.P. and urged its sale in Trendex. It fell heavily, and
within 12 months had lost one-third of its market value. The
low point was reached in 1965. Last year we bought B.H.P.
again for our portfolio clients and in June, 1966, strongly
recommended its purchase in Trendex at $5.88. B.H.P. has
since nearly trebled in price. This is a good run. But what
happens next? Should one hold on for further gains, or would
it be prudent to get out before the other fellows sell and push
the price down?
What About PekoP
And what about Western Mining and other similar stocks
which have been excellent investments over the last six or
twelve months? The market doesn’t value them on a dividend
yield basis. Nobody is buying Western Mining just to wait 200
years to get his money back at the present rate of dividend
or 75 years for 8.H.P., or 60 years for Peko. People are buying
or holding in the expectation of future benefits. The market
valuation is largely emotional. Buying power and selling pres-
sure are emotionally controlled. When selling pressure begins
to exceed buying power, B.H.P. will top out and begin to fall.
So will Western Mining, Peko, and all other stocks in their
turn.
The Trendex methods measure the forces in the market. Our
clients and subscribers, and the increasing ranks of those who
have learned to follow Trendex over the years, are able to use
the Trendex methods of analysing market action, to make
market gains and reduce market losses. They have learned to
buy or hold shares because market action shows that they are
likely to go up. They sell them because market action shows
that they are likely to fall. They have learned to ignore what
everybody says they “ought” to be doing.
Investment Grade Stocks
Trendex publishes an Action Table each week, keeping tabs
on about 100 stocks which have been discussed and recommen-
ded for purchase in Trendex. Twenty stocks specially recom-
mended for long-term investors are included in the table. The
table shows the action to be taken for each stock right now.
No stock is recommended and then conveniently forgotten. All
are kept in the Action Table until recommended for sale. Ask
for a sample copy.
Trading Profits
For some time Trendex has featured a weekly summary
of stocks with recommended action for Traders apd Specu-
lators. For the convenience of those trader subscribers who
wish to act on Trendex principles every day in this fast market,
we also introduced on 11th September a Special Daily Service.
This provides positive buying and selling recommendations for
a small range of active trading stocks.
Traders have jumped in and out of a few of these stocks
several times. The tabulation shows every completed trans-
action up to 23/10/67 since the Special Daily Service started.
It gives the buying price, the selling price, and the number of
days the stock was held.

THE WEEK BRIEFLY
FOr the economy : The September quarter’s produc-
tion statistics display a slowing-up in the growth rate of iron
and steel output, as well as of Portland cement; consumer
durables are better, together with motor vehicles (excluding
trucks).
The two months to August saw exports to China jump
dramatically from $10.6m. to $19.6m., due largely to wheat;
exports to Japan rose, while those to the U.K. and U.S.
dropped back; considerably less iron and steel was exported.
Over the year to June 30, oil refineries in Australia lifted
their output of refined petroleum products by 13.3 percent.
For the marhetSl Mining (including nickel) and oil
issues on Australian share markets have been brought back;
industrials showed some weakening, but finished tolerably
firm.
A brighter position for companies pushed London equities
to a peak; adverse external influences were ignored . . . Wall
Street developed technical irregularities within a fairly
narrow range of dealings.
For companies ; BHP is on the move again at Port
Kembla, where a new s2sm. mill will increase wide steel
plate output from 475,000 to 825,000 tons a year; it will be
completely commissioned by the end of 1969.
The American International Minerals and Chemicals Cor-
poration has announced the discovery of nearly 500,000 m.
tons of phosphate ore “in north-western Australia” (Queens-
land).
Miners and oil prospectors don’t lessen their vigor . . . The
first six months’ production from Barrow Island yielded

reduction, from 8 cents to 6 cents a share, comes from
Lcloma Mining Corporation.
Sydney’s sad old city retailer Anthony Hordern came to
light with its first profit since 1961—57541, against the pre-
vious year’s $399,894 loss . . . On its merry way, G. J. Coles
intends to build and own regional shopping centres instead
of leasing areas in them ... In Melbourne, the famous
Georges will be rejuvenated by the new Georges Australia

MEN AND MATTERS
SIMON HEATH HAS really come up
in the world. Two weeks ago he made
the change from a windowless base-
ment in Sydney’s Hunter Street, where
he was a stockbroker, to the top (26th)
floor in the new Royal Exchange As-
surance Building in Bridge Street
where, as managing director of the new
Rothschild-Oppenheimer International
Pacific Corporation Ltd., he sits with
a panoramic view of the harbor
behind him.
But the change from broking into
merchant banking is not such a great
one as it looks (apart from the view
and lift ride) for the 36-year-old for-
mer partner in the prestigious firm of
Hordern Utz and Bede. Two of his
old partners have a large stake in
IPC and are on its board. And Heath,
himself, had eight years’ merchant
banking experience before following his
father’s prewar example and becoming
a Sydney stockbroker.
Finance is in the Heath blood. His
grandfather, Sir Claude Reading, was
chairman of the Commonwealth Bank;
his cousin, John Darling, is a managing
director of Darling and Co., the mer-
chant banking outfit that Heath’s "new
group will riva’.
A King’s School boy who started off
doing accountancy, Simon Heath
changed his mind in 1951 and went to
London as a 20-year-old, spending half
of his British stay, which lasted until
1953, with Lazards in their merchant
banking operation before coming back
to work in Melbourne for Anglo Aus-
tralian (now merged in with Australian
United Corporation), in which Lazards
and Morgan Grenfell had a stake. Dur-
ing this six-year stint with Anglo Aus-
tralian, he got some U.S. training.
WITH THE LATE Sir Arthur Warner
alongside, the Bolte Government had
all the business expertise it thought it
needed to accomplish great economic
acts of state. Even if Warner’s presence
wasn’t quite enough to stop a lot of
people driving their coaches through the
pre-1961 Companies Act, it sufficed to
see that free enterprise got an unfettered
run to fortune and Victoria to un-
precedented prosperity. When Sir
Arthur gradually eased out of Cabinet
councils and finally departed, he left a
vacuum of business acumen which the
farmers and lawyers in it have failed
to fill. This has been felt acutely by
the Premier, Sir Henry Bolte, even
more by his eminence grise, 58-year-old
lawyer and Chief Secretary, Mr. Arthur
A. G. Rylah
Simon Heath
Rylah, who is never happy when at a
loss either in power or authority.
Appropriately, perhaps, for a politi-
cian, in a belated move to make good
his frankly admitted lack of business ex-
perience Mr. Rylah got his first seat on
a public company board last week at
Easywear. The founder of this 21-year-
old Fitzroy clothing and footwear firm,
Mr. I. A. Dabscheck (his son R. S. is
present chairman and managing direc-
tor), lives at Camberwell, just over the
rise from Kew, where Rylah was born,
bred, and went to school (Trinity
Grammar), has always lived, and, con-
tinuously since 1949, represented in
the Legislative Assembly.


THE
CROESUS
TOUCH
The background of
the Grimwade
business dynasty
BY J. C. HORSFALL
THE LATE SIR RUSSELL GRIM-
WADE is an excellent subject for a
biography, arid J. R. Poynter, Ernest
Scott Professor of History at Melbourne
University, is a notable historian. In
tackling the Grimwade biography which
MUP has published this week, it was
up to Poynter to decide how much of
Russell he would put into the book and
how much industrial history to frame
the portrait. As it happens, the frame-
work looms the larger, and what we get
is less than we were looking for about
Russell, whom unfortunately Poynter
had never met, but a whole lot more
than we expected of the building of
the Grimwade industrial dynasty. Even
if this is now diffused in the general
corporate structure of Australian
industry, it at one time commanded
some of our biggest industries and made
a substantial contribution to industrial
growth as a whole.
Poynter makes no apologies for tak-
ing a broad historical sweep of the
dynasty in its heyday. To the taunt that
the prominent industrial families of
that stage in national development have
abdicated, he answers that the financial
basis of that power has been largely
overwhelmed in the vastly extended
capital structure of the giant firm, a
structure inevitably inimical to share-
holders’ control. He thinks this is easier
to explain than, say, the continuance
of power and influence of such families
for so long, where the reasons may lie
more in social and educational than in
financial things. He sees Russell Grim-
wade as representing a particular stage
in this trend toward industrial im-
personification, because he and his
brothers were the second generation,
controlling fortunes and interests then
still undispersed by inheritance. It was
only in the third generation that family
wealth, in itself dispersed and relatively,
if not absolutely, diminished, was no
longer sufficient to guarantee positions
of economic power even if it could be
an advantage.
These days, when the overseas inva-
sion of Australian industry and mining
is more or less taken for granted, it is
well to remember that the basic struc-
ture was laid down long before the
modern invaders arrived, and also that,
contrary to the general impression over-
seas, Australia, even 30 years ago, was
not exactly an industrial infant. Subse-
quent development, in which local firms
have played a significant part, has
further lifted the platform from which
overseas capital can make its spectacu-
lar industrial advances here. Following
through Poynter’s account of the de-
velopments initiated by one or another
of the Grimwades, and springing basic-
ally from the original (1867) partner-
ship of Arthur Felton and F. S. Grim-
wade in Melbourne, you get a good
measure of both the breadth and the
depth of the locally initiated content of
such development.
In two of the most powerful public
companies to have had their roots in
the original partnership, Russell Grim-
wade, the youngest of the sons of F.S.,
had only a minor role. These were
Drug Houses of Australia and Aus-
tralian Consolidated Industries. Both
these Felton, Grimwade & Co. offshoots
were well on their way to national
renown before Russell came on the com-
pany scene in 1907, after schooling at
Melbourne Grammar (which figures
surprisingly little in the book) and some
general industrial. experience. How-
ever, the accounts rendered on these
two saplings, in their early days, at
least, are as entertaining as one might
expect, especially with figures such as
“Gunboat” Smith, to whom the later
spectacular growth must be mainly
attributed, well to the fore in ACI,
which didn’t take on its present title
until 1930. There is still a Grimwade
on the board, J.F.T., who is a son of
Russell’s second-eldest brother, Harold,
also once chairman of the company;
Russell himself had no children.
Russell’s part in the development of
Drug Houses of Australia was largely
in connection with J. Bosito & Co.,
which became a subsidiary in 1951.
Unlike his elder brothers, Norton and
Harold, whose main flairs were for
finance and management, Russell was
more disposed toward the practical
side of industry, technical innovation,
and the development of new industrial
processes. Bositos was a natural attrac-
tion for him, as its main product was
eucalyptus oil. All his life, Russell
maintained a keen interest in trees
(especially eucalypts, on which he pub-
lished a book). This interest took him
on innumerable long treks as well as
into most of the distinguished offices of
■ the Australian forestry world, and gave
him his main hobby, wood-carving, in
which he was a master craftsman, and
led him to be one of the founders of
the CSIRO.
In Poynter’s view, his outstanding
work was in bringing forward the Aus-
tralian Oxygen Company, which was
formed by the Grimwade brothers in
the year of their father’s death (1910),
and subsequently became Australia’s
leading industrial gases concern, Com-
monwealth Industrial Gases, on its mer-
ger with a Sydney firm, Commonwealth
Oxygen Company, formed in the same
year. There is little doubt, the author
states, “that without Russell’s interests
and enthusiasm the Grimwade brothers
would not have launched this new ven-
ture, the first of a series of develop-
ments in which his instinct for innova-
tion was to be fruitfully combined with
his older brothers’ experience and
acumen.” (It is surprising, though, in
Poynter’s view, to find that Russell
showed very little interest in the tech-
nical problems the brothers continued
to have with the glass-making concern.)
Another offshoot, but a much earlier
one, from the Felton, Grimwade part-
nership was the launching of acid pro-
duction in 1872; from this emerged the
fertiliser firm Cuming Smith & Co. in
1897, ten years before Russell became
a junior partner. Russell acted as
alternative director for his brother
Harold while the latter was at World
War I, during which the company
bounded ahead despite continued losses
on a wood distillation plant which was
Russell’s special interest in the com-
pany.
Between the wars, Russell doesn’t
appear to have been deeply involved
with the affairs of this firm, though
Poynter says that, as an alternative
director to Norton, he was familiar
with them. He doesn’t figure in the
discussion where the author relates the
events which led up to the formation
of Commonwealth Fertilisers and
Chemicals in 1920 merging the Vic-
torian fertiliser interests of several firms,
including those of Cum'ing Smith,
whose management seems to have been
in the hands of the Cuming family,
not the Grimwades.
Probably Russell’s main industrial
baby in the Grimwade complex was
Carba Dry Ice Limited (now Carba
Ltd.), but this was a very much smaller
show than the big three, DHA, ACI,
and CIG, and also Cuming Smith.
It was formed in 1929, and after 1935
it had the distinction of being the only
one of their companies over which
they retained almost complete owner-
ship and control. Russell had taken
the initiative in its formation; the
management was left mostly in the
hands of his nephew Geoffrey (who
died in 1961). After terrible growing-
pains, Carba has long since emerged
as Australia’s biggest carbon dioxide
group. Its present chairman is Andrew
Grimwade, who is only 37, the grand-
son of Russell’s brother Alfred, who
went into medicine ; • d wasn’t much
involved in the business side of the
Grimwade interests.
Like many of the Grimwade progeny-
over the 90 years since F.S. got to-
gether with Arthur Felton (there’s a lot
of interesting stuff about him in the
book, by the way), Carba has, this year,
turned its attention to New Zealand.
In partnership with Wright Stevenson
& Co. it is going into a project which
will use natural sources of carbon
dioxide supply in New Zealand.


Behind those fine glasses: Don Sara, Director, S.O.L.A. in Adelaide.
Confidentially,
this man exports lenses to Japan.
It’s rather like carting coals to Newcastle,
eh? To do that sort of thing you need
to be pretty confident. Well that’s exactly
what Don Sara is.
He’s confident of his product. His
company, Scientific Optical Laboratories
of Australia, makes lenses for sunglasses
and protective goggles. They’re selling
extremely well in Japan - and in the USA.
Already, 17% of S.O.L.A’s sales are
exports. And that’s only the start.
Don Sara says, “If you’re confident of
your product - of its quality - what’s
stopping you from exporting it?”
Good question, don’t you think?
Note: Exporting can increase your
turnover; can lower unit costs of your
product; can iron out seasonal
fluctuations; and can increase profits.
Your company will gain extra marketing
knowledge, and prestige.

WILD CAT PAGES
The mining men and the boys
By JASON
OF COURSE, THINGS got a bit out
of hand on the mining post; naturally,
there has been a reaction. The big ques-
tion remains: is the mining market over-
valued despite last week’s fall in share
prices or are prices soon to continue
their upward rush?
For nickel fever is not the only thing
that has been pushing the miners up;
almost every section has been bouncing
along on a boom-based euphoria. Have
a look down the oil and mining list;
hardly any stocks are down around
their lowest point for the year, and most
are within a short distance of their
peaks. Even stocks like Silver Valley
Uranium and other hangovers from the
1960 boom are enjoying a run.
Within six months most of these
should be back down around the lowest
point again. For the mining industry
in this country is now a business for
big men with big resources; the acci-
dental possession of a useful lease is
about the only way small companies
can hope to get a stake in the pickings,
and most of these small-fry are not
going to be so lucky. It takes more than
luck to discover things these days.
But it is absurd to dismiss the mining
boom as something that is just a passing
phase. This week’s projections by the
Department of National Development
dramatise the fact that Australia’s
mineral industries are going to provide
a significantly increasing amount of
income by 1971/2. The Department
shows that on the basis of signed con-
tracts for the faster developing products
like iron ore, and on informed estimates
for the others, total mineral exports
should jump in the next five years from
last year’s $384 million to $B3O million.
The impact of this sort of thing on
the balance-of-payments position is
significant; on mining company profits
it is going to be phenomenal.
Among the products that will do
best are iron ore (inevitably) and alum-
inium (in various forms). Iron-ore
exports are expected to jump from
$46 million worth to $2lO million
worth on the basis of existing con-
tracts only by 1971/2; aluminium
(and bauxite and alumina) exports
should jump by more than five times
to $129 million, rising from its present
position of seventh on the list of
major minerals export earners to
third after iron ore and coal. Coal
exports should just about double to
$135 million and this estimate is based
only on signed contracts (there are
prospects of a far greater increase
in coal exports), lifting coal from be-
ing a less important export than lead
to a far bigger income earner. Copper
should more than double its export
earnings, from $28.6 million last year
to $69 million in 1971/2.
Growth for the mineral sands in-
dustry lags behind these in the De-
MINING • SHARE LIST • BEHIND THE BALANCE SHEETS
MARKET POINTERS • SECURITY ANALYSIS • COMMODITIES
partment’s forecasts, but its 50 percent
expected rise in export earnings to
$47 million is still very healthy. Silver
exports are expected to jump sharply
from $2.5 million to $10.5 million;
lead exports should rise by one-third
to $99.8 million; zinc by 20 percent
to $6O million; and tin by 60 percent
to $6 million.
The list does suggest (with the notable
exception of products like nickel, oil,
and phosphate, which naturally do
not get a mention) just where mining
investors could be putting their funds.
The CRA group is one of the best
situated to benefit from the fastest
growing of all these sectors.
Consolidated Goldfields of Australia
has a fair stake in the growth areas,
with iron ore, tin, copper, coal, and
mineral sands among its fast-rising
minerals. The implications of the more
than doubled export income for copper
for Mt. Isa and Peko-Mt. Morgan (and
for Broken Plill South if Cobar does
as well as expected) are most signi-
ficant.
THE MARKET SEEMS to have for-
gotten that Bradford Cotton used to
pay a 12-|- percent dividend instead of
its present 10 percent rate —and that
the last time it did so, in 1961, its earn-
ing rate of ordinary capital was about
16 percent, compared with the latest
17.2 percent rate.
This year the company's profit should
be well up; at last week’s annual meet-
ing the chairman, Sir Robert Webster,
said that profits (not just sales) in the
first quarter of the current year were
“substantially” (“and I mean substan-
tially”) above those for the same quar-
ter of last year. But so they should be,
for the September quarter, 1966, was
dreadful for the textile industry and was
bad enough to cause an 8J percent profit
fall .for the group in the first half of
the year. So the profit recovery in the
second half of 1966/7 was really
significant.
If this rate of profit advance con-
tinues into this year (and indications
are that it might do), then the full
result for 1967/8 will be a corker. To
reinforce the view that there is still
plenty of scope for further improve-
ment in Bradford’s earnings, it is strik-
ing that last year’s profit was at the
rate of 7 percent on the cost of the
group’s fixed assets, whereas its earnings
in 1960 (its last year at 1 percent
dividend) were at the rate of 9 percent
on their cost. Yet in these intervening
six years the company’s plant has been
revolutionised, and, given the new
stability to the industry that followed
the latest Tariff Board inquiry, the old
The Chartist says:
McDONALD INDUSTRIES LTD. was first recommended as a recovery stock at
about 49c in February, 1967. A target of $1.20 was given, and this has already been
achieved. The stock can now be reassessed on recent market action, as a well-tested
200 percent uptrend line has now been confirmed. The possibility of a further rise
to approximately $3 is indicated. Last sale price on 24/10/’67 $1.38.

was not an unusually good year; the
company did a fair bit better in 1958.)
At present the company is retaining
about $531,000 after dividends and
has a cash flow of more than $2 mil-
lion. Certainly it has a great deal of
use to which it could put these retained

in dividends; it has large borrowings

it has four or five years’ scope yet) and

Its balance sheet looks better all round;
its current ratio is up from 1.5 times to
1.7 times cover of its current liabilities
by its current assets, due mainly to two
healthy moves —a $2 million drop in
bank overdraft and a $-| million cut in
stocks. These lower stocks were despite
a percent increase in turnover which
resulted in a four percent rise in debtors
(after deducting a. bad-debt provision
and write-off totalling about two per-
cent of debtors).
But shareholders could expect some
increased rewards this year, particularly
if earning rate breaks the 20 percent
level, which is by no means unlikely.
At last week’s 67c the shares had been
6c higher this year, so the current dis-
interest of the market appears to reject
not only the likely prospect of capital
appreciation and a dividend rise but
also the attractive (and well covered)
7,5 percent dividend yield.
THE CHARTIST provides the follow-
ing additional comments on stocks
examined earlier:
BHP is still holding a steep, well-
confirmed uptrend and could be safely
held on current market action.
GMK and HILL 50 have both
strengthened technically over the past
few weeks, and earlier upside targets
of close to $3.00 and $1.50 respectively
could still be considered.

No swing toward

A LOT OF PROFIT-TAKING in
mining shares rather than any great
swing toward industrials gave a better
balance to the market last week, com-
pared with the lopsided appearance it’s
taken on recently, but there’s obvi-
ously so much smoke around the min-
ing camps and, with the report season
almost at an end in industrials, it
could easily get topsy-turvy again. On
the other hand, with all the excitement
in the mining world these past few
months, few have had sufficient time to

“Surprising”, you might say, “where could you put the axle?” Not so surpris-

using several Olympic heavy-duty tyres to form a king-size cushion to keep
the overhanging deck of the container ship “Kooringa” from bumping against
the wharf at the Port of Melbourne’s Victoria Dock. Rather a change for
Olympic tyres and quite unlike the many thousands on cars and trucks run-
ning safely along every highway in Australia.

Hemorrhoids
It strikes 7 out of every 10 people in
all walks of life. Yet many otherwise
intelligent people know little of its dan-

vated by many factors—including
over-exertion and unsuitable diet.
Neglect—and reliance on superficial
relief—invites serious medical conse-
quences. Eight years’ Swiss research
developed Varemoid Tablets —now
regarded by overseas specialists as the
leading anti-inflammatory treatment
for piles. Remarkable improvement is
being achieved- —even with sufferers
of over 20 years. A week’s course

spare to weigh properly the welter of
news coming from industrial companies,
anybody with time on their hands now
to go back over it could find the
exercise rewarding. It could attract the
legions who have capital gains from
flutters in mining shares to reinvest and,
as well they might, think that further
essays in that direction will be in-
creasingly risky.
IT WILL SOON be quite like old
times again when Georges, in brand
new colors, is called by traders again.
It seems a long time since 1960, when
it was shouted so frantically by dealers
from Weres and Potters in one of the
classic bidding duels of the century and
the company was put in Sir Frank
Richardson’s then Cox Bros. lap.
Neither firm is concerned in the float
of the new company, Georges Australia
Ltd.; its initiation is in the hands of
merchant bankers Darling & Co., and
Melbourne broker Guest, Keen & Bell,
who will put out 2,324,000 50 cent
shares at 75 cents to raise about slf
million. The prospectus shows that the
new group, whose managing director
will be A. M. Forbes, paid $3,335,303
for the enterprise, which compares with
a valuation of $3,826,550 in Cox Bros.’
books. The company is starting life
rather in the old Cox Bros, tradition
with $1,121,311 in short- and long-term
borrowings, is going to give discounts
to shareholder customers, and, natur-
ally, is very confident.
ONE WOULDN’T SAY that the mar-
ket has revived its thirst for soft drinks
shares on last week’s intimation in the
Schweppes and Tarax reports that the
trade is going to do a whole lot better
this full year as a result of the general
increase in selling prices throughout the
industry from March last year. The
industry is beset with rising costs, of
which the latest (June) increase in
the wholesale price of sugar was a blow
to be added to the latest lift in wages
(since July). On top of these are
the continued highly competitive nature
of the business and the uncertainties of
the weather.
If, in fact, the soft drinks trade is
going to buck up, Tarax would seem
to offer the bigger scope for recovery
after last year’s dismal profit showing
which gave rise to a cut from 12 to
10 percent in the dividend, the latter,
however, being barely covered by 11.5
percent earnings (only just over half
the previous year’s 22.1 percent). The
shares are down to 78, which is 6 cents
above their low for the year, to yield
6.5 percent or about double that of
Schweppes’. The latter, around the cur-
rent price of 147, yield 3.7 (they’ve been
up to 170 and as low as 142 this year).
Of course Schweppes has the more
superior market status of the two, with
its considerably higher net assets back-
ing for the 50-cent par of both shares
(L 7 as against 1.01), its much higher
and its more superior profit perform-
ance last year compared with Tarax’s
earnings rate (18.2 compared with 11.5)
sharp fall. Schweppes is continuing its
drive into interstate markets, last
year concentrating on bottling two
South Australian firms with vari-
ous franchises and supplying some of
them from Melbourne pro tem. For its
part, Tarax mopped up a couple of
northern Victorian firms (at Sheppar-
ton and Wodonga) in cash deals and
hopes these will give it more of the
thinly populated country markets to the
north and south of the border.
THE MARKET’S LONG been inured
to the rattles in the body and shares
of Melbourne’s only listed Ford dis-
tributor, Alan Coffey Motor Invest-
ments, whose movements since the high
earnings rate of 17.4 percent in the 1960
boom year have been mostly in reverse.
After its heavy pinking in 1965-66, last
year it made some progress, but in low
gear, notching a small profit of $5950.
Nobody seemed to want the 50-cent
shares last week at the knock-down
price of 27 cents, despite the fact that
it made a combined trading profit of
$58,096 on its four Ford dealerships
and that the paucity of profit was
attributed to heavy losses on the wind-
ing-up of its dealership in Moorabbin
and a motor auctions subsidiary which
was closed down in June. Until the
HQ gets off the left bank of the Yarra
at the end of Queen’s Bridge, which
has become a backwater for motorists
since Kinpsway, few are likely to en-
thuse. Coffey seems to be going ahead
with its plans further to concentrate
there, despite the South Melbourne
Council’s redevelopment plans for the
area. But, like other dealers, it could
get a lift from better sales this year.
INVESTORS STOPPED putting thei-F
shirts on Pelaco a long time ago, though
a few were prepared to give the com-
pany the benefit of the doubt a year
ago, when, after its profit was decimated
to a mere $20,025 in the year to June,
’66, it claimed to be a victim of the
computer revolution, with rather too
many of its debtors slipping off the
punch cards. The explanation of the
further drastic deterioration to a. loss
of $182,090 in 1966-67 is much more
convincing that something has gone
drastically astray on the costing and
production sides. One suspects that
management has also been at fault, but
this isn’t mentioned by the directors.
Although turnover continues to expand
(up 8.1 percent last year), profit
margins have evaporated. Even if, as it
says, the company is now rolling up its
shirt sleeves, and attending vigorously
to the rents in its apparel, the shares
hardly look cheap at the price of 43
cents, and no final dividend (they were
up to 70 earlier this year). But it might
be worth putting a few away for later
on if, as Mr. Theo Kelly believes, cloth-
ing prices are on their way up, as most
others appear to be.

SPECULATOR’S
DIARY
This hot market
and all the
feverish tigers
PEGGY LEE’S SONG about everyone
having the Fever could have been
written about today’s investors. The
summer is here and the market is hot.
Hot with rumors; with excitement;
with profit-swollen investors; with stocks
whose prices are based on hope (and
precious little else); and with tired
stockbrokers grumbling about taxation
bills. However, even as I write, there
seems to be a slight lull coming over
the market, so who knows . . .? Act-
ually the whole business so far reminds
me of Stephen Foster. Why? Was it
not he who wrote:
De Camptown race track five miles
long,
Oh doodah day!
Gwine to run all night!
Gwine to run all day!
I bet my money on de bobtail nag,
Somebody bet on de bay.
The first stock I’m betting on this
week is Jaywoth Industries, the con-
crete masonry people of St. Marys
(Sydney) and Darra (Brisbane). This
is the sort of stock in the type of
situation I continually search for, but
so rarely find. It is, in my opinion, a
stock that is being temporarily over-
looked and undervalued by the market.
Before going into the details why, let’s
have a quick look at the company’s
history. Since listing back in 1960, the
company’s record hasn’t really been one
to write home about. During the first
three years of its life on the Stock Ex-
change, all it managed to do was turn
in three consecutive losses (consistency
if nothing else). During the next three
years, which includes the year just
ended, it finally came good and earned
profits. Not brilliant profits, however,
but profits.
Why then do I think the company
has such a great speculator potential?
Here’s why. Firstly, at 15 cents the
company is a cheapie, and has a cer-
tain natural appeal for this very reason
alone (a 3 cent rise is a 20 percent
profit). Secondly, the stock is near its
year’s low and historically has room
to move back up. Also, its price has
never failed to reach less than 20 cents
at one time or other over each of the
past two years. Thirdly, and this should
be considered in the light of the cur-
rent low price, the company looks like
having a bumper year. Its latest state-
ment, only a few weeks ago, was that
all indicators pointed to the current
six months being the best the company
has ever enjoyed. In addition to all
this the company has a reasonable asset
backing and a nice little nest-egg of
around $520,000 in tax losses. The
latter should keep the tax man from the
door for at least the next couple of
years. These are the reasons for launch-
ing out and buying 4000 Jaywoth.
My only other bet for the week
was more of a gamble than a rational
investment. It was Planet Oil. I de-
cided to give it a go because, like it
or not, the market has got the Fever.
Even though it appears, at the time of
writing, as though it’s cooling some-
what, it still looks to me like a sleeping
tiger that will again spring to life as
soon as someone finds something some-
where. I figure that if you can’t lick
‘em, you may as well join ’em (at least
for a while, anyway). I quickly add,
however, that this is one investment
I’ll be watching with more than usual
attention.
The reason I chose Planet was be-
cause of the growing interest in the
stock and its price. Its contributing
shares, which were 14 cents on Sep-
tember 1, were 19 cents a month later,
and are now 27 cents, having been
quite a bit higher, but having eased
back with the lull (which is handy).
The interest in the stock is probably
because its drilling program at Ban-
cannia, near Broken Hill, is now enter-
ing into its most interesting stage. The
latest news I had was that, at the half-
way point on the first hole, everything
was supposed to be more or less in
line with the initial seismic surveys.
So here’s hoping that the rest is the
same. I’m hoping to the extent of $l3B,
which is the cost of 500 contributing
shares in the company.
Sales for the week were both profit-
able. General Credits, which has been
on the books for six months, went off
at 70 cents and earned a profit of $29,
while the CBC rights which I bought
earlier this month came good with a
small but sweet profit of $l5.
BOUGHT
4000 Jaywoth $0.15 $612
500 Planet 10c pd. $0.27 $l3B
SOLD
400 General Credits $0.70 $282
400 CBC rights $1.65 $647
This all leaves me with $4l in kitty,
which might make handy betting
money for the Melbourne Cup.

TV recall
test.
r|3«*/°;
How many commercials can you
remember from a half hour
TV programme? Five? Ten? Fifteen?
It’s vital for all advertisers to know the potential recall of commercials
but until last week nobody knew for sure. So GTV9 and TCN9
commissioned Audience Studies Inc., a leading international research
organisation, to study TV commercial effectiveness. They showed
similarly matched audiences a current TV programme changing
the number of commercials in the programme each time.
The results proved a hunch we’4 had for years. If your commercial
is screened along with 13 others, as compared to being one of only 8,
then your chance of recall drops 53%. GTV9 and TCN9 guarantee
you greater recall because we never run more than 9 minutes of
commercials in any prime time hour although the Australian
Broadcasting Control Board allows 11 minutes.
Put your product on Channel 9 Sydney and Melbourne. Join the
list of those who realise that our uncluttered commercial policy gives
them a hidden cost-per-thousand advantage in commercial effectiveness.

Behind the balance sheets
A bad set of accounts from
Consolidated Metal
FOR A STOCK WITH such respect-
able associations as Consolidated Metal
Products, the Sydney-based metal pro-
cessor and merchant, to be selling for
only 8.7 times its latest earnings gives
it every appearance of being a bargain.
And the real prospect of a healthy
profit rise in the current year adds
strength to its apparent bargain status.
But investors considering a purchase
have little more than the group’s res-
pectability -to guide them; the latest
accounts are both inadequate and mis-
leading.
It is distressing that a board com-
prising such leaders of the business
community as Consolidated Metal’s
should have given their support to
methods of accounting that, if used by
less honorable directors, could bring
disastrous results. For the stockmarket
now knows precious little about this
company. Its accounts have little mean-,
ing for comparative purposes and its
profit and loss statement is simply
wrong. For, following a takeover last
April, most of the company’s profits
now come from an entirely new source
the scrap-metal business. Just how
much profit this new acquisition pro-
vides is one of the many mysteries in
the accounts (along with the price paid
for this business that has so trans-
formed the company). All we know is
that the company’s capital went up by
two-thirds as a result of the one-for-
three premium share issue and equal-
sized placement of shares that went
toward financing the cash deal, and that
the price paid was $3.7 million more
than the par value of the shares in the
new subsidiary.
The character of Consolidated Metal
has changed so drastically that share-
holders should be entitled to as much
information about the new subsidiary,
Adelaide and Melbourne scrap mer-
chants W. Brown and Sons Pty. Ltd,
as they would get in a prospectus.
Nevertheless, if the Brown acquisition
cost little more than $3.7 million, and
if its profits can be maintained, then
it was an excellent buy, with last year’s
apparent Brown earnings returning
about 15 percent on Consolidated’s
apparent investment. But, apart from
an assurance from Consolidated direc-
tors that there should be benefits to
come from the integration of Browns
into the group, shareholders have no
idea of the performance of Browns, or
the extent to which it benefited from
the once-and-for-all copper scrap boom,
or the strength of its accounts. A buyer
of Consolidated Metal shares is depend-
ing entirely on the board’s judgment.
Even more serious is the way the
board hides the fact that profits from
its traditional operations were falling
substantially for the second year in a
row, and that net profit may have
been down by as much as 30 per-
cent but for * the Brown buy. The
company says its profit more than
doubled in 1966-67 to $805,406. This
is grossly misleading, as it includes
$437,749 of pre-acquisition profits from
the Brown Brothers’ subsidiaries, earned
in the ten months or so before they
became part of Consolidated Metal. In
other words, Consolidated Metal paid
out capital in order to buy profits that
are taxable and, by adding these pre-
acquisition profits on to its own, it
obscured the fact that Consolidated
Metal’s profit had fallen by something
like $26,000 in the year.
On top of that, if the Brown interests
continued to earn at their 10-month rate
for the two months or so they were in
Consolidated’s hands, then it seems
that profits from Consolidated’s tradi-
tional- activities may well have fallen
to something less than $275,000 —a drop
of about 30 percent. And had it not
been for another accounting device,
the fall would have been greater. For
during the year the company sold off
enough of a subsidiary that incurred a
loss for it to be no longer consolidated
into the accounts, thus saving itself an
unstated further drain on its net profit.
This former subsidiary, Layne and
Bowler (A’sia) Pty. Ltd., which is
now 50 percent owned in conjunction
with American partners, is a fairly sub-
stantial operation, with Consolidated
Metal apparently having invested close
to $200,000 in it in shares and loans.
And Consolidated Metal has guaranteed
its overdraft up to $200,000.
Another view of Consolidated Metals
profit downturn comes from comparing
the latest stated profit of $805,406 with
the $840,000 the company says would
have been earned in 1965-66 had Browns
been included after allowing for in-
terest on loans arranged for the acquisi-
tion, and tax at public company rates.
But no matter how much Consoli-
dated Metal needed the Brown profits,
the fact remains that they have given
the company a far better appearance.
Although capital issued to finance the
takeover did not all rank for the final
dividend, the earnings of the enlarged
group for the whole year, related to the
final capital, were 29.8 percent com-
pared with 25.1 percent the year before.
Since the takeover took place within
the last quarter of the financial year,
few of the important economies ex-
pected could have been made in that
short time. A good improvement in
their newly merged activities could be
looked for this year, with group results
possibly nudging the $900,000 mark, or
something like 33 percent on capital.
Consolidated Metal’s business before
the Brown takeover was reduced to its
traditional lead smelting and fabricat-
ing operations and the Grasslands
farm equipment business. (A new
venture of the previous year into tallow
rendering was sold off for a capital
profit of about $140,000.) The Brown
business consists of collecting and pro-
cessing for resale a wide range of
ferrous and non-ferrous metal scrap. It
has made fairly steep profit increases
over the past five years, and is bud-
geted for higher profits this year,
although the rate of growth may not
be maintained. It has been largely con-
trolled by the metal market; for in-
stance, in the first half of 1966-67 the
boom in copper prices helped profits,
but the price came down in the second
half, with some profit reaction. Absorb-
ing Brown into the accounts has
changed the relation of debtors and
creditors from a rough balance to
debtors of $2.3 million (about
doubled) being now $400,000 more
than creditors. Stocks have risen 76
percent from $1.9 million to $3.3
million.
The lead business of Consolidated
Metal is not at risk on lead stocks be-
yond the work in progress (lead prices,
anyway, have been stagnant, if de-
pressed over the past year). The com-
pany tries to buy and sell on the same
market. It affirms that it is not a
trader in lead. This will gradually
apply to the rest of the business. The
aluminium scrap business has an ex-
citing future, although there is com-
petition. Consolidated Metal acts as
one of Alcoa’s selling agents. The
aluminium business has built up in the
past six months, and is welcomed after
the long-term dullness of lead.
A number of circumstances con-
verged to create unfavorable conditions
in the first half of 1966-67 in the old
part of Consolidated Metal’s business
in lead and farm machinery, but their
results for the first quarter of this
year compared well with the opening
stages of 1965-66. The drought condi-
tions which prevailed first in Queens-
land and N.S.W., and later in Vic-
toria and S.A., have not helped Grass-
lands’ machinery business, which has
had difficulty earning profits com-
mensurate with the outlay and capital
involved. Its products include irrigation
systems good enough to win royalty
agreements in California, which should
bring in significant amounts this year.
A range of sophisticated farm
machinery is made here at Villawood
under licence from two U.S. firms,
Gehl Bros, and Hesston, and other
products are imported from them, and
huge glass-lined steel silos from another
principal. The company has merchants
in all States to give nationwide cover-
age.

operation, bought to protect the com-
pany’s supplies, and, of late, lack of
water has prevented anything except
developmental work. In New Zealand
the company has a lead smelter and
lead oxide plant, and Rokfire battery
factory. Profits have all been ploughed
back into the business.
Three small par issues every second
year from 1955, followed by a two-for-
nine bonus in 1959, and a one-for-five
issue at 50 percent premium in June,
1965, provided capital growth for share-
holders up to the point of the Brown
acquisition. This event prompted a one-
for-three issue at 100 percent premium
to shareholders and an issue of equal
size, 540,000 shares, to Mount Morgan
Ltd., also at 100 percent premium, giv-
ing that company a 20 percent share-
holding. (The Mount Morgan share-
holding in Consolidated Metal did not
rank for 1966-67 dividends.) On top of
the $2.2 million these issues raised, the
company borrowed cash to pay for the
takeover; mortgage loans of $2.2m.
appeared ($600,000 the year before), of
which s2m. was repayable beyond the
current year.
Although the company collected
$1,080,000 in share premiums from
these share issues to add to pre-
acquisition profits and reserves of
nearly $2.3m., the $3.7m. increase in
excess of cost over par value of shares
in subsidiary companies meant, overall,
a decline in shareholders’ funds from
$2.30 to $1.67 per stock unit.
The company has so far made no
attempt to write off any of the intan-
gible assets totalling $4.1 million that
represent the excess of cost over par
value of shares in subsidiaries. But this
may not be as bad as it seems, for the
difference between cost and par value
of shares could well overstate “intan-
gibles,” anyway; the more modern and
sensible measure is between the cost
and the value of assets acquired. Fixed
assets of the group jumped $1.4 million
to $3.3 million after the takeover, and
net current assets rose by about
$600,000. But the uninformative way
the company values the assets it has
acquired appears to avoid the intention
of the Companies Act, which requires
the basis of valuation to be stated (at
cost or valuation at certain dates and
so on). In an inane note to the accounts
about these subsidiary assets the com-
pany reveals that “their land, buildings,
and amenities are included at the values
at which they appeared in the books
of those subsidiaries at date of acquisi-
tion.” As copies of the books of Brown
Brothers are not made available to
shareholders, this leaves them com-
pletely unaware of the basis of valua-
tion.
The $312,000 increase in investments
is accounted for by an investment in a

move as and when the profit trend
allows, although the reserves position
relative to issued capital has weakened
since this promise was given.
The chairman of Consolidated Metal,
Mr. J. H. Broinowski, is also chair-
man of Mt. Morgan, which attracted
a bid from the U.S. Power Corpora-
tion, but seems more likely to unite
with Peko-Wallsend Investments Ltd.
Mr. Brcinowski’s connections with the
merchant bank, Darling and Co., of
which he is a managing director (as is
another Consolidated Metal director,
Mr. J. Darling), should continue to be
useful to Consolidated Metal; Darlings
arranged the $l.l million share place-
ment to Mt. Morgan. Whatever the
outcome of the Mt. Morgan battle,
Consolidated Metal’s shareholders are
assured their interest will be given due
regard if Mt. Morgan’s 20 percent share-
holding has to be disposed of.
The present market price of the $1
shares at $2.60 affords a 5.1 percent
dividend return, and taking a conserva-
tive view that profits will rise to only
30 percent on capital this year (they
should do better than that), the earn-
ings yield would be 11.6 percent, mak-
ing an interesting enough performer.

Security analysis
Elders GM rather
badly treated
THE FANTASTIC MOVEMENTS in
the prices of some mining shares re-
cently makes one wonder whether-there
can ever be a return to a pricing sys-
tem based on current earnings. In
fact, in most cases where the share price
movements have been extreme, there
has been little question of “value.” The
prices paid have been determined
mainly by those old economic factors
of suppy and demand factors which
must always have a material bearing on
the prices paid in any “true” market.
However, to revert to the somewhat
damaged theory that price is at least
related to earnings, Elder Smith Golds-
brough Mort Ltd. ordinary shares seem
to be rather badly treated by the mar-
ket. I could suspect even that those

selling at the moment at prices around
$2.25 think that they are selling a share
whose par value is 50 cents rather than
$l. So far as I can see, the company is
currently earning nearly 32 cents per
share and paying 11 cents per share as
a dividend. While I am not a believer
in buying earnings unless I can see a
fair chance that they will eventually be
paid out, I would be inclined to pay a
minimum of $2.75 for Elder Smith
GM’s shares on the basis of the recent
annual report and the record of the
past five years.
This record in terms of the usual
statistics is as follows:
Year to Jme 30 1963 1964 1965 1966 1967

Share prices:
High c 272 295 270 254 271
Low c 170 245 197 200 210
These figures look quite attractive,
especially when it is considered that,
in the per share earnings figure, allow-
ance has been made for the declining
percentage that tax bears to pre-tax
profit.
The relatively low proprietorship
ratio is due to the fact that, in com-
mon with all pastoral finance com-
panies, Elder Smith GM acts as a
banker to its rural clientele. At June
30, 1967, “Clients’ balances and other
deposits” represented 38 percent of
total liabilities and 47 percent of cur-
rent liabilities.
It is equally apparent that long-term
liabilities form a very small percentage
of total liabilities. The balance sheet
divisions indicate that this percentage
would have been only about 19 J per-
cent at June 30, 1967.
The company also gives a fairly ex-
tensive breakdown of its various activi-
ties and the following schedule has been
prepared from the figures published in
the annual reports of recent years:
Year to June 30 1963 1964 1965 1966 1967
$ million
Sales of:
wool 203.4 242.0 195 2 202.0 200.8
livestock 154.3 180.1 175.7 178.7 198.0
merchandise 70.5 78.8 89.8 97.9 100.4
land 37.9 55.8 54.3 43.3 50.4
Other revenue 9.9 _ 14.6 32.1 19.1 16 0
Total sales 476.0 571.3 547.1 541.0 565.6
It must be remembered, however,
that the margins available to Elder
Smith GM on a large proportion of
these sales are quite small and a more
satisfactory figure to examine (in pre-
ference to the sales figure) might well
be the figure which is called “Earn-
ings” in the annual report. This figure
is the total of ‘‘lncome from trading”
and “Income from investments” and
the trend in these items has been as
follows:
Year to June 30 1963 1964 1965 1966 1967

exchanges fell to $507,919 from
$940,824, yet according to the balance
sheet the market value increased
slightly. I wonder if it is possible that
the income from “Australian public
securities” was included in 1964/5
but excluded in 1965/6.
While we can make some estimate
of the commissions earned from wool,
livestock, and land sales, and from
travel and insurance, the return from
other major activities, such as the
merchandise group (which handles
both rural and industrial products, of
which more than one hundred are listed
in the 1967 annual report) and the
finance division, is almost impossible to.
estimate.
Other activities where the return
cannot be assessed are the shipping
activities and property ownership.
The annual reports suggest that the
earnings of the former have fluctuated
in recent years, but no indication is
given as to the trends of the income
from the pastoral properties owned. It
also seems likely that the descriptions
given in the annual report cover the
Esperance Land Development scheme
and the shareholding in Squatting
Investments.
The figures which can be extracted
from the balance sheet and which
should give some indication in the
trend in the earnings of the finance
division would be:
Year to June 30 1963 1964 1965 1966 1967
$ million
Advances, trade
debtors, etc. 72.1 75.8 87.2 81.7 95.4
Short term
deposits, etc. 12.6 10.9 2.0 4.8 2.5
Australian public
securities (a) 5.8 2.2 20.8 25.8
Total ~ 84.7 92.5 91.4 107.3 123.7
The curious feature of these figures
is the enormous increase in the hold-
ings of “Australian public securities”
in 1965/6. The increase was of the
order of $l9 million, which seems to
have been provided by running down
“Advances, etc.,” by about $5.5 million
and increasing bank loans ($7.3 mil-
lion), trade creditors ($5 million),
and other borrowings by a total of
$14.5 million. The further increase of
$5 million in 1966/7 suggests that
Elder GM was under no great strain
in meeting the demands for financial
assistance by its clients.
To cover the sources of revenue in
a general fashion, I suspect that “earn-
ings” from wool, livestock, and land
sales have been steady over the past
four years. I also believe that the same
situation applies to aggregate “earn-
ings” from travel, insurance, shipping,
and produce sales.
There has, however, been a fairly
steady increase in “Income from trad-
ing,” and I must therefore assume that
this increase is due to the merchandise
group and the finance division. The
figures would support this, for sales of
merchandise have increased by 42| per-
cent over the past four years and
income-earning current assets have
increased by 46 percent over the past
three years. This could mean that future
growth in Elder GM’s per share earn-
ings will depend rather more on the
expertises of a merchant and a financier
than on those of a woolbroker.
Elder GM also has a few interesting
natural resources projects running at
the present time. They are the Esper-
ance Land Development scheme, the
Nabalco alumina project at Gove, and
a scheme for exporting char made from
brown coal briquettes. I doubt whether
anyone would care to estimate the earn-
ings which could be received eventually
from these projects.
One of Elder GM’s greatest suc-
cesses in the .past four years has been
its ability to control costs. Staff costs
(salaries, wages, pension contributions,
and provisions for long-service leave
and annual leave) have increased by
only 1\ percent over this whole period.
Administrative expenses (plus interest)
increased by only 4 percent. The whole
of the increases in both these items
occurred in 1966/7, for the 1965/6
figures were fractionally lower than the
1962/3 figures.
It will be interesting to see whether
the group can continue to hold down
costs, for, if it can, further increases
in per share earnings can be expected
in the future.

field for more than 100
years. They enjoy a world
reputation as manufacturers
of machine tools, pumps,
bolts and nuts and engineer-

strings include the manu-
facture of twist drills, hack-

technical services, in manu-
facturing— particularly of
Macson lathes and Ajax

division with Ajax bolts

any bigger than McPher-

Mining
Mount Lyell has
real potential
WHILE CONSOLIDATED GOLD-
FIELDS’ investment in Renison
Limited has been most unrewarding
this year, the market has perhaps
overlooked the compensating develop-
ments taking place at Queenstown by
Mount Lyell Mining and Railway
Company Limited. In fact, a volumi-
nous broker’s evaluation of Australian
natural resources, published in October,
itself pays scant heed to the potential
profitability likely to come from this
company’s current expansion. Certainly
Mount Lyell does not maintain an
exploration program outside of its
own immediate areas, and for this
reason has been bypassed by the exu-
berance of the market, which is looking
for prospectors rather than miners.
Nevertheless, there are very few mining
companies of Mount Lyell’s size which
carry dividend yield of 3.9 percent and
sell for only times last year’s earn-
ings.
The chairman’s address in August
gave details of an expansion in capac-
ity and also anticipated the mining of
higher-grade ore than that mined in
recent years. The combination of these
two developments should make quite
a big difference to future profits, quite
apart from the continued strength of
copper prices due to industrial trouble
in America, which must be expected to
come to an end in due course. This
trouble has meant that instead of per-
haps a small surplus in world copper
supplies this year, there will be a
shortfall. Local producers raised their
price by $5O per ton a little while
ago, up to $950 per ton (equivalent to
£stg3Bo), and with firming overseas
prices above £stg4oo, another local
price increase is likely should the
American strikes not be resolved soon.
Mount Lyell’s crushing plant is to
be modified to allow the treatment of
ore to rise from the present level of
around 2.2 million tons per annum to
2.5 million tons, an increase of almost
14 percent. This work is to be carried
out during the Christmas shut-down
period and will thus mean very little,
if any, loss to normal production. The
actual increase in production does not
seem a great deal, but the 1900 extra
tons of copper will bring an increase in
revenue during this current year of
some $900,000, and for a full 12 months
will add about $l.B million, with only
relatively small additional costs. These
estimates are based on the current
Australian producers’ copper price of
$950 per ton.
Until the price of copper rose a
few years ago, Mount Lyell had for
many years been a fairly marginal
operation, and regularly received pay-
ments under the Copper Bounty Act,

which guaranteed in effect a price of
$6OO to local producers. Whilst the
current copper price is held up by
industrial trouble, it has been com-
monly thought that in normal times
the price would slip back to, and
stabilise around, a level of about
£stg3oo, equivalent to £A7SO.
Although this is still above the price
the company was getting under the
Bounty Act, it is still $2OO less than
has been received in recent years, when
profits have been above the $2 million
mark ($892,000 in 1965, $2,300,000 in
1966, and $2,747,000 in 1967). On
the company’s normal production of
14,000 tons per annum, such a fall in
price would wipe about $2 million off
profits after tax. The significance for
the company’s future of the expan-
sion to be carried out is that it will
make up a goodly portion of this
possible loss—the increase in produc-
tion will mean additional mining costs,
but treatment costs should not rise
commensurately.
The other factor which places the
company in a very good position to
weather any falls in metals prices is
the move to higher grades of ore.
This was also mentioned in the chair-
man’s address last August. By the
end of 1968 financial year, that is, by
next June, the company will be min-
ing ore from the Crown Lyell No. 3
orebody. This orebody contains
3,680,000 tons of 1.6 percent copper
ore, more than twice the grade of the
ore curently being mined from the
West Lyell orebody, which contains
0.78 percent copper. The Crown Lyell
orebody also contains higher grades of
gold and silver than does the West
Lyell deposit. The increase in ore
treatment capacity of 300,000 tons will
be using ore drawn from this orebody.
Thus the increase in production will
mean a straight lift of 150,000 tons of
ore of the present grade in the six
months from next January, and after
then the extra 300,000 tons per annum
will consist of the higher grade ore.
In financial terms, profit should re-
ceive the benefit during the current
financial year of the $900,000 increase
in revenue before mentioned, and in
the following year the increase in
revenue will be not $1,800,000 (as it
would be if the grade were the same),
but $3,600,000. Such an increase can
withstand quite a fall in copper prices
before Mount Lyell’s $2,000,000-plus
profit comes into danger.
In the event that copper prices re-
main close to their current level for a
full year’s production from this higher
grade orebody, it is worth remembering
that the increase in revenue due to
higher grades will only have to bear
the cost of taxation (at 34 percent).
The increase in revenue due to greater
ore production will have to bear some
costs, but on last year’s figures these
costs should not be more than $4 per
ton, perhaps less, to leave at least
$600,000 before tax.
With last year’s profit of $2,747,000
and likely increases of $1,800,000 (after
tax) from the items described, it
is not surprising that the chairman
of Consolidated Goldfields considers
that overall results from this subsi-
diary should be satisfactory. The addi-
tion of the higher-grade ore from the
Crown Lyell No. 3 orebody should
last about 12 years at a rate of 300,000
tons per year; as the other orebodies
have a life - of only some six years, it
seems likely that an increasing quantity
of ore will come from the richer
Crown Lyell No. 3 deposit. In future
years the grade of ore mined will pro-
gressively improve as ore comes not
only from this deposit but from other
orebodies, all of which contain better
grades than the orebody currently
being mined. This takes no account of
the very large (40-45 million tons)
deposit of one percent copper ore
which reaches to 1250 feet below the
final bottom of the present open-cut.
This deposit is being tested to a depth

seems likely to contain sufficient ore
for Mount Lyell to continue opera-
tions for many years after the present
open-cut operation ends. Until that
time, however, shareholders seem
assured of good profits from the de-

being undertaken, and they should not
be too anxious about the price of
copper.
Commodities
Moves to stabilise
rubber prices
NATURAL RUBBER producers, and
especially Malaysia, have begun to feel
a little less pessimistic about the future
of their product. Talks initiated at the
Algiers conference of 77 developing
nations could possibly lead to the
establishment of some form of com-
modity agreement. At any rate, such
desperate expedients as attempts to sell
direct to consumers, noted in the Sep-
tember 30 issue of The Bulletin, may
happily be discarded.
Not that rubber is by any means out
of the wood. A considerable amount of
discussion will have to occur between
producers and consumers. The first
steps, however, are being taken. Under
the auspices of the United Nations’
Conference on Trade and Development,
the two parties will come together at
Geneva in the middle of this month.
The main impetus has derived, not
surprisingly, from Malaysia, which pre-
sented a summary and forthright paper
to the Algiers assembly. The argument
went far beyond putting just the
general position of commodity trade in
developing countries; that has found
reiteration at so many conferences.
Each commodity, of course, seems to
possess its own critical problems. These
are therefore probably best solved by
separate and individual agreements.
There is hardly any need to mention
that natural rubber’s chief obstacle is
the tremendous competition from syn-
thetic rubber. The situation has also
been aggravated by selling from stock-
piles, particularly by the U.S.A.; indeed,
Malaysia has had to make direct pro-
tests about this. Charges of dumping of
synthetic in Europe are not lacking
and price-cutting by synthetic makers
is endemic.
Among other commodities, some kind
of price stability has been achieved
(with occasional lapses) by coffee,
cocoa, and sugar; at least a foundation
for international agreement exists in
these cases. So far as rubber is con-
cerned, pricing has been outside the
range of the International Rubber
Study Group, which embraces only the

statistical examination and publicising
of natural and synthetic production and
consumption.
A reasonably stable and favorable
price for natural rubber is vital for
Malaysia, Indonesia, Vietnam, Cam-
bodia, and Liberia rubber brought
in more than 40 percent of their ex-
port earnings during 1964, for instance.
For Thailand and Ceylon rubber is the
second most important export earner.
The past six years have seen the
price fall by over 50 percent. It has
been calculated that this meant a loss
of $U.5.4172 million to the 14 pro-
ducer countries a trade loss far
greater than the financial aid coming
from the developed countries.
The producers of natural have not
stood still in the battle with synthetic.
Devices such as export taxes provide
money for research and replanting. As
a consequence, world production shows
significant increases in most of the pro-
ducer countries. Faster-maturing trees
can be tapped earlier and yields have
risen dramatically.
Standards and typing are improving
as well: rubber is now much more
exactly graded for its various industrial
usages.
The conference of natural rubber
producing countries, held at Kuala
Lumpur early in October, rather
bravely agreed that prevailing low
prices (actually the worst for 19 years)
were mostly caused by short-term fac-
tors and not to any change in natural’s
competitive positions. The relevant
“factors” made a somwhat distress-
ing bunch, however: recession in the
major consuming countries; strikes at
several major U.S. rubber-manufac-
turing plants; the Suez Canal closure;
reduced intake by Mainland China;
and “poor market sentiment and market
manipulations.” Yet, as with other
natural commodities meeting the syn-
thetics advance, the longer-term prob-
lems are daunting enough.
Natural rubber faces a huge surplus
capacity of synthetic production and a
high accumulation of synthetic stocks. A
considerable struggle to rationalise
each side of the industry lies ahead.
Something can be hoped from the
producer-consumer meeting. It may
like to recall a recent warning by
Malaysia’s Minister for Commerce and
Industry, Dr. Lim Swee Aun.
“I hope the developed countries will
recognise that the uncontrolled produc-
tion and use of synthetic rubber and its
dumping have done considerable
damage to the economy of the
countries producing natural rubber.”

Something of the steam has been taken out of the more
speculative side of the mining and oil markets; the corrections
were most noticeable midweek, yet they continued to the end
on more restrained volumes. Perhaps Great Boulder can
symbolise the process: it lost a net 10 cents over the week to
finish at $9.50, after hitting as low as $8.30. BHP shed 75 cents
in reaching $14.75, while Western Mining dropped 70 cents and
closed at $24.90. Good additions were put on by Hamersley (40
cents), CRA (46 cents), Consolidated Gold (30 cents), and
Broken Hill South (15 cents).

THE LAND
N.Z. seeks a new pesticide
NEW ZEALAND’S FARMERS are
urgently seeking a DDT substitute for
their battle against pasture pests. The
necessary properties of the required
pesticide have been outlined to chemi-
cal manufacturers in America, Britain,
West Germany, Switzerland, and Italy
by the Minister for Agriculture, Mr.
Talboys. Since New Zealand has mil-
lions of acres under treatment, an ex-
tremely lucrative market is at hand
for the right chemical.
The Department of Agriculture ex-
plains that grass grub, porina cater-
pillar, and black beetle are the major
problems. Earlier this year there were
serious infestations on lush Canterbury
pastures of the two first-named pests
and in some areas they are developing
a resistance to DDT. The effect of any
chemical’s residue on dairy products is
another problem. Mr. Talboys said
New Zealand’s need is for a long-term
product, but none at present could
meet all the requirements of cost, effi-
ciency, and residue safety. The De-
partment of Scientific and Industrial
Research has tested all insecticides on
the market. Over the past several
years between 50 and 60 new chemi-
cals have been tried.
Any substitute pesticide will have to
be stable in the soil, with a half-life of
three to six months under rainfall of
20 to 60 inches a year and a wide
range of soil temperatures; be non-sys-
tematic in pasture plants; be capable
of penetrating soil with rain; and not
leave toxic residues in the flesh or fat
of grazing animals.
Because of chemical residue tolerance
restrictions by different countries (only
a very low tolerance is accepted in the
United States for meat and dairy pro-
ducts and West Germany has imposed
strict tests on fruit and vegetable im-
ports) the use of DDT on New Zealand
farms is under very strict supervision.
In the months of May, June, and July
DDT is now banned on dairy farms
and another recent move is to make a
permit for applying the
chemical from August to April. The
permit is issued by the Department of
Agriculture and the chemical can only
be applied to a third of a dairy farm
at one time. The treated area must be
left clear of stock for a period of six
weeks. No permit is needed to apply
DDT on sheep and beef farms, but
there are certain conditions of its use
set out in department regulations.
The grass grub beetle flies between
November and December. The grubs
live in the soil and eat the roots of
plants through summer to winter if
they are not destroyed. Ten grubs per
square foot can destroy the feed for at
least one ewe per acre. The grass grub
is widespread; the black beetle problem
is limited to an area in the far north
of the North Island. And because of the
possibility of food contamination, the
chemical dieldrin has been banned as
a pest control. No tolerance for diel-
drin is allowed in foodstuffs in New
Zealand or overseas.
The Assistant Director-General of the
Department of Agriculture, Dr. A. T.
Johns, recently returned from a trip to
America and Britain to investigate pos-
sible pesticides. He said DDT will have
to be phased out in New Zealand and
this will depend on a suitable replace-
ment. So far there is no effective
replacement, Dr. Johns added, but the
ultimate solution may not be an insecti-
cide but “juvenile” hormones. He said
American scientists are working on
tests which might produce “youth”
hormones in insects to prevent them
from reaching the breeding stage.
On the field and in the labs the
plans to win the battle continue. At
Nelson, in the South Island, entomolo-
gists with the DSIR are trapping grass
grub beetles on the wing in a novel
manner. To catch the beetles in flight
a car is being used. On the front of
the car a special frame is mounted, to
which is attached six plastic pockets
which are similar in shape to ice-cream
cones.
A mild winter has resulted in record
numbers of porina moths for October.
They were flying about two weeks
earlier this year. The caterpillars
hatched from their eggs burrow under-
ground but come out to eat the surface
pasture. A department official has said,
“A farmer with two caterpillars to the
square foot has a problem. If he has
seven caterpillars to the square foot
they will destroy his pasture by the
autumn.”

Agriculture in the Australian Economy.
Edited by D. B. Williams. Sydney
University Press. $6.00.
JUST ABOUT EVERYBODY who is
anybody in the profession of agricul-
tural economics in Australia has con-
tributed to this large book of 369
pages. Fifteen senior authors have
compiled its 16 chapters. Several
are university professors and the
others are high-ranking officers in
Federal and State departments, with
one exception. Mr. G. D. A. Chislett,
economist for the Australian Wool-
growers and Graziers’ Council, has
provided a fine description of the his-
tory, purpose, and achievements of the
eight major primary producer organi-
sations.
The book was produced to mark the
25th anniversary of the establishment
of the profession of agricultural eco-
nomics in Australia and provide a re-
view of the Australian rural scene for
visitors attending • the International
Conference of Agricultural Economists,
which was held in Sydney last August.
With this being its inspiration and
intention, it is not, perhaps, surprising
that the book tends to be backward
looking. In a word, it attempts to des-
cribe how we have gotten into our
present predicament.
In the process a vast array of
facts and figures are paraded, appear-
ing often in fascinating juxtapositions,
For example, one swift sentence tells us
that, while Australia ranks 41st among
the nations of the world in population,
we are . 13th in order of the value of
our trad f an d tenth in exports per
head. This seems to put in perspective
t | ie °lt-heaxd charge that we are a
slo Y enly , and “effictent peop e. Sheep
“ d ca "! e populations presently around
lbU million and 19 million, are expected
t 0 rise ultimately to a ceiling £ ound
450 million and 85 million, respectively,
So d wou i d seem that the pastoral
industry has still developed only about
one-quarter of its potential,
The challenge confronting the man
on the land is nearly as great today as
it was 150 years ago. Almost 20 percent
of the total area top-dressed with ferti-
liser is now treated from the air. Yet
more farmers can manage horses than
pilot aeroplanes! However, the average
man on the land works 4228 acres,
Over the ten-year period 1956/65,
while the on-farm male labor force fell
11 percent, the number of tractors rose
46 percent. At the same time, beef
cattle numbers went up 18 percent, but

Almost every page has a sprinkling of
this sort of information. Since there is
a good index, the book can be used as
a reference source. Errors, typogra-
phical or otherwise, are very hard to
spot..
For the politically minded, Mr.
Chislett discusses the pros and cons of
unity and diversity among the organisa-
tions representing primary producers.
He debunks, by the way, the popular
notion that the many farmers’ organisa-
tions have strong affiliations with cer-
tain political parties. Indeed, he claims
that they have none nowadays. Alto-
gether his is one of the most absorbing
chapters in the whole book. It amounts
to a masterful, yet succinct, description
of how our primary producers have
managed, despite frequent sanguine
squabbles between their manifold fac-
tions, to organise for the purpose of
protecting their economic welfare.
There is a chapter on trade policy
which is also clear and precise, but
spelled out in tones that are too flat
to arouse the reader’s interest suffi-
ciently in this vital area. It seems a
pity that Dr. B. R. Davidson, of
“Northern Myth” fame, was invited by
the editorial committee to assemble the
material for a basically descriptive
chapter entitled “The Economic Struc-
ture of Australian Farms.” One fancies
he would have put more ginger in the
chapter on “Agricultural Development
Projects.” Its author, Mr. E. S. Hoff-
man, is a senior official in the Depart-
ment of Primary Industry, and accord-
ingly constrained to tell the bare facts
assiduously, avoiding any interpreta-
tions, because they lead inexorably to
controversy.
But it must be conceded that while
Mr. Hoffman’s presentation does not
set a torch to anything, few could have
told the story better. It covers com-
prehensively and compactly a huge
list of projects of national importance.
After coming upon this chapter,
national and international critics of the
effort that Australia is making to
develop her agricultural and pastoral
resources ought to pipe down.
It has been mentioned that the book
was conceived in celebration of an
anniversary, and on this account it is
understandable that the authors
adopted a stocktaking approach and a
historical view. But the most obvious
lesson of history is that progress,
whether social, political, economic, or
even technological, rests on farming.
Therefore, it is a pity that they did
not choose to relate existing circum-
stances with the future rather than the
past. More discussion of problems
already on the horizon, such as pro-
vision of international aid, the declin-
ing quality of rural life relative to
urban living, the formation of regional
international trade groups, the passing
of the family farm, the lack of agri-
cultural extension and rural education,
etc., would have been appreciated.


ARTS AND ENTERTAINMFNT
An event well worth recording
By DAVID SALTER
COAT OFF, collar unbuttoned, and tie
askew, Peter Sculthorpe crawled
around on hands and knees in the
ABC’s Sydney orchestral studio. Be-
hind him, neat and unruffled in his
traditional navy-blue rehearsal jacket,
Sir Bernard Heinze was patiently tak-
ing the Sydney Symphony Orchestra
through the young Australian com-
poser’s “Anniversary Music,” a work
commissioned by the ABC to mark the
completion of 20 years of the Youth
Concert series.
It became one of those very minor
races against time. If Sculthorpe hadn’t
finished stringing a set of antique cym-
bals together before the percussion
player’s cue, valuable rehearsal time
would have been lost. The task was
made even more difficult by constant
queries from the musicians, most of
which Sir Bernard passed on to the
composer. But perseverance (and long
practice at fiddling with ethnomusico-
logical bits and pieces) won through:
after a brief demonstration of how to
play the instrument, the exploration of
“Anniversary Music” was allowed to
continue unimpeded.
Although Sir Bernard had performed
the work with other State orchestras
during the year, this session with the
SSO was in many ways a completely
new venture. Revisions had been made
in the score, for once there was almost
unlimited rehearsal time, and when
everything had been sorted out the
ABC sound team would make a stereo
recording of the piece.
For these reasons, the rehearsal was
peculiarly unhurried. At one stage,
while the strings, wind, and brass en-
joyed a two-hour morning tea break
(which eventually merged into lunch),
the percussion section slowly untangled
the difficulties of their complex, vital
role. Occasionally the chief recordist
would amble in to change a micro-
phone position or discuss a problem of
balance with the conductor. There was
even time for Sculthorpe to experi-
ment with new methods of obtaining
the subde array of exotic effects he
wanted.
Suddenly, as 2.30 p.m. passed, every-
one realised that they hadn’t a bar of
the music on tape. It was the old story.
Still not enough rehearsal time. The
recording engineers started talking in
terms of “finishing it off tomorrow,”
but Sir Bernard was determined to have
the bulk of “Anniversary Music” cut
by the end of the session.
As often happens with opening per-
formances in the concert hall, Take
One was the first time the orchestra
had played through the work in its
entirety. Leaving the final touches to
the conductor, Sculthorpe retired to the
less taxing company of the recording
director, his sound mixer, and deck
operator, who were squashed into a
makeshift booth (the Chatswood studio
is still only half-converted from its
former picture theatre self) and were
using equipment brought in for the
occasion. Temporary wiring, relays,
power, and amplification systems made
trying to move an electronic obstacle
course.
Take One completed, Sir Bernard
Sculthorpe... answering questions
joined the party. It was like the
arrangement of judges and timekeepers
at an Olympic sprint finish. Ranged
along the centre-line between the two
giant speaker boxes sat the mixer,
twiddling randomly at his console, be-
hind him Sir Bernard, conducting along
with the score, Sculthorpe, half-standing
and reading over his shoulder, on toes
the recording director reading over his
shoulder, and finally the deck operator,
erect before his machine, mumbling
complaints about a weak spot in the
tape surface. The orchestra’s leader,
Don Hazelwood, stood quietly by, sip-
ping ABC tea as the playback
unfolded.
It was obvious (and previously ex-
pected) that the first cut would not be
used. There were periods of hesitant
playing in transition between sections,
and the dynamic balance existing within
the clarinet, piccolo, and flute trio was
distorted. Try again.
While Sir Bernard returned to tidy
up the troublesome patches with the
orchestra, Sculthorpe and the engineers
discussed the quality of sound obtained.
The probing, sensitive ears of a multi-
microphone stereo setup allowed the
composer to place textures and
dynamics in a clearer pattern than
could possibly be attained in a large
performance. Sophisticated modem
recording techniques have taken the
contemporary composer a stage further
toward total control of his creations.
From the outset, the second run-
through was a more intense and excit-
ing account. The ensemble seemed
tighter, the percussion alive to the
rhythmic flow of the music, and : —plop!
Sir Bernard had finished a sweeping
crescendo gesture by knocking his score
off the stand. Conductor and orchestra
batted on, but the accident had per-
mitted a general untidiness to creep into
the remainder of the performance. It
was a better take on playback both
Heinze and Sculthorpe were bubbling
with enthusiasm but it was unusable.
Everyone involved would have to
come back the following day. On the
surface there was a high spirit of optim-
ism “most probably get it in the
can in under two hours” but the
players knew that after a night’s sleep
it was often like starting all over
again.
And they were right. No matter how
earnestly he tried throughout the morn-
ing, Sir Bernard could not get the
orchestra to give a completely unblem-
ished take. Small sections were excel-
lent, superior to anything recorded
previously, but minor disasters of
intonation or timing kept interrupting
what might have been the performance.
As there was another work to tape that
afternoon, the director decided to grab
as many good sections as he could be-
fore lunch and splice them together in
the cutting room.
An unsatisfying solution particu-
larly for the conductor but one
which has become standard practice in
commercial recording. Your splendid
Bruno Walter (or whatever) LP of a
Beethoven Symphony is more likely
the product of three days’ ingenious
splicing than 40 minutes’ inspired play-
ing in the studio.
The rehearsals for “Anniversary
Music” had begun on a Wednesday.
By Friday night Sculthorpe had a
dubbed copy of the final result. In
places, a single note from a better take
had been slipped into the basic cut. It
is quite impossible to hear any gaps
or slight differences that might reveal
the jigsaw-puzzle manner in which the
recording was put together. The corn-


poser was happy (the work should be
eventually processed to disc), Sir
Bernard was busy rehearsing the Youth
Concert program in which “Annivers-
ary Music” is the special offering.
Music
A 300-year-old
" happening"
By PAUL FROLICH
“L’Orfeo,” by Claudio Monteverdi. Pro
Musica Society. Union Theatre, Syd-
ney University.
WITH INTEREST in traditional con-
cert activities in a decline, particularly
among the young, there is an upsurge
of music-making in new directions,
divorced from the cultural establish-
ment shared between the ABC and the
Elizabethan Theatre Trust. Signs of this
trend have been abundant in Sydney in
recent weeks. Evenings of “psychedelic”
music, recitals by the ISCM and “Pro-
ject New Music,” Roger Covell’s
presentation of “The Tempest in
Music” at the University of N.S.W.,
Bach’s B minor Mass performed by
Sydney University Graduates’ Musical
Society, and now, not least, the first
Australian performance of Monte-
verdi’s “L’Orfeo” by the Pro Musica
Society of Sydney University. Whether
or not such “happenings” are properly
functions of our universities (and I
rather think that they are), the trend
is a welcome one.
The Monteverdi work has long been
recognised as the first European opera,
but to most of us was little more than
a footnote in histories of music. Claudio
Monteverdi composed “La Favola
d’Orfeo” in 1607, at the age of 40,
in the service of the Dukes of Mantua,
who, far from recognising his true
genius, treated him about as shabbily
as Mozart was to be treated by his
princely patrons. The work is unique
in that it blends and assimilates every
one of the musical styles then current:
madrigal, Florentine recitative, Flemish
polyphony, and the rich Venetian
orchestral techniques are used in a suc-
cession of soli, ensembles, choruses,
orchestral pieces, and dances of the
greatest diversity.
That Professor Peart, of Sydney’s
Music Department, should have
attempted so ambitious an undertaking
with but two professional singers, a
few professional instrumentalists, and a
company which consisted of students
is indeed worthy of praise. Musical
matters apart, the occasion was success-
ful mainly because of the work of one
of our most brilliant young producers.
Rick Billinghurst, a recent graduate
from NIDA, managed to present a
stylish and authentic-seeming perform-
ance with no more than a revolving
stage, a set of spiralling platforms, a
feeling for color and lighting, and, I
should imagine, a vast amount of sheer
hard work. In the result, an imagina-
tive conception was well realised with
the assistance of six dancers from the
Margaret Barr Dance Drama Group,
whose stylised movements contributed
much to the atmosphere of the opera.
The two principals were the only pro-
fessional singers; Marilyn Richardson,
as Music and Eurydice, was quite out-
standing. She has long made a point of
studying Renaissance ornamentation,
and it was her confident style which
first enabled me to appreciate the con-
ventions of the period and to turn my-
self into a Renaissance listener. South
Australian Thomas Edmonds’ fine and
powerful tenor, almost equally at home
in the required ornaments, contributed
much to the opera’s success, even
though he (having been but recently
drafted for the part) alone sang in
English; the rest of the company had
mastered the Italian text admirably
well. All other singers were students,
who should not be subjected to pro-
fessional criticism; however, most of
them managed very well indeed, and I
was particularly impressed by bass
Frank Murphy, who sang the parts of
The first Australian “L’Orfeo”. .. “great and unfamiliar music”

Charon and Pluto with great dramatic
conviction.
The orchestra, in the manner of the
period, was ranged at either side of
the playing area, divided into continuo
and consort sections. Period flavor was
supplied by four crumhorns, a cornet,
and sections of recorders, trombones,
and trumpets. The string players, not
at ease in the 17th-century conventions,
were rather inaccurate, but this was
easily forgiven in the general welter of
fine old sound which came from an
Irish harp, double basses, a tabor,
guitar, and jingles. Conductor Donald
Peart, principal singers, and producer
apart, the real honors of the perform-
ance were due to harpsichordist Win-
some Evans, who (with an excessively
amplified instrument) gave the singers
the clues and firm support needed for
the convincing presentation of such
great but unfamiliar music.
Happy anniversary
By PAUL FROLICH
ABC Youth Concert Series. Town Hall,
Sydney.
THE FINAL Youth Concert of the sea-
son was specially significant as it cele-
brated the 20th anniversary of the first
of these concerts. Very rightly, it was
conducted by Sir Bernard Heinze, the
founder of this series for young people,
and the evening was distinguished by
the first performance of Peter Scul-
thorpe’s “Anniversary Music,” commis-
sioned by the ABC for the occasion.
The concert was, in all, a happy
event. It opened with Weber’s gay and
charming “Abu Hassan” Overture, thus
setting the mood for an evening largely
devoted to lyricism and nostalgia.
The “Anniversary Music” is quite a
remarkable work. It is, in some respects,
a direct extension of Sculthorpe’s
methods in “Sun Music I” and of his
sentiments in the “Irkanda” series, but
it differs greatly from these works.
There is a strong melodic line woven
into powerful rhythmic sections and the
main influence heard in this music is
Asian—with intimations of a gamelan
band, pentatonic tunes, bells and all
kinds of percussive devices. The strings
produce shimmering textures and bird
sounds, the trombones supply some
braying slides, the oboe sings a little
song. At a recent seminar, Peter Scul-
thorpe asserted that he wrote from the
heart, every time, and this music seems
to prove it: the whole thing is com-
pletely logical, thoroughly delightful,
and certain to charm most listeners.
Despite some minor inaccuracies, this
difficult music was well played and Sir
Bernard clearly revelled in its novel
sounds.
The concerto, Dvorak’s G minor,
was the evening’s only disappointment.
Mr. Firkusny is a truly fine pianist and
musician and he did his best; the


unfortunate fact is that the concerto
is very dull indeed, one of Dvorak’s
poorest works, and hardly worthy of
being sandwiched between Sculthorpe
and Shostakovich!
The latter’s fifth symphony, opus 47,
is indeed a great work, and I am grate-
ful to Sir Bernard for making us
familiar with it I last heard it con-
ducted by him in November, 1965.
That Sir Bernard, with other conduc-
tors, enjoys this music is understand-
able; luckily, it also appeals to most
orchestral players, and it was in this
work that the orchestra gave one of the
season’s best performances. Every sec-
tion, including the oft-maligned horns,
played quite splendidly, and the concert
was such as should ensure a good
response from subscribers when next
year’s Youth Concert bookings open.
Theatre
Three of a kind,
but no full house
By BEVERLEY TIVEY
But I Wouldn’t Want To Live There.
Phillip Theatre, Sydney.
SHOWS STAGED IN POW camps,
girls’ boarding schools, and similar
unnatural institutions must of necessity
use players of only one gender, and
allowance is automatically made by the
audience. But why limit yourself in this
way if you don’t have to?
Thank goodness the new Phillip
revue doesn’t resort to transvestism
the three actresses remain true to their
sex, and the only males on view are
three dressy tailor’s dummies. But
there’s an inherent lack of balance that
spoils its impact as satirical revue.
John McKellar’s script is patchy, at
its best sharply perceptive, but some-
times barely above the level of school
concert humor (the America’s Cup
sketch, for instance). Peter Batey’s
direction is smoothly expert, the sets
adequate, the musical score so unobtru-
sive as to be unnoticeable.
Fortunately, the players are a very
talented trio. Gloria Dawn is a fine,
versatile, gutsy comedienne who can
make even her most mediocre sketches
a lot funnier than they deserve; Ruth
Cracknell and Lyle O’Hara, though
sometimes bogged down in poor
material, can really rise to the occasion
when they’re given the wherewithal.
And the finale, when each of the girls
gives her version of a one-woman show,
is extremely droll and gives each a final
chance to show her paces.
Thanks in great part to the actresses
involved, the revue makes an always
pleasant and sometimes very entertain-
ing evening, but well, I wouldn’t
want to live there, either.
The great enigma
By MADELEINE ARMSTRONG
Incident at Vichy. Arthur Miller.
Ensemble Theatre, Sydney.
EVER SINCE the Allies broke into
the Nazi concentration camps at the
end of World War II and the facts of
the slaughter of 6,000,000 Jews became
known, the world has been asking:
“How could human beings have done
this?” But of recent years the question
has changed, and Jews have been ask-
ing: “How could the Jews have
allowed this to happen to themselves?”
This is the question which mainly in-
terests Miller in this play.
The action takes place in Vichy, the
capital of unoccupied France in 1942.
Seated on two benches facing each
other on a bare stage are seven prison-
ers. They have been arrested, singly, in
the streets by a group consisting of a
German professor, a German major,
and three French policemen. They do
not know why they have been arrested,
and they sit numbed, waiting, unwilling
to speak, all except Lebeau, the
bearded painter, who is by nature nerv-
ous and talkative. From the point of
view of the electrician, the businessman,
even the actor, Lebeau is irresponsible,
and rather childish. They, because they
have to observe times and seasons, to
present a public face, are more inclined
to accept regimentation, to think it pru-
dent not to make a fuss, to assume
that the authorities, however harsh, will
behave reasonably. At first they dare
not realise, and, later, most of them
■cannot accept, that they have been
snatched in a few moments from the
jivorld they knew, with its familiar
rewards and punishments, and trans-
ferred to a nightmare.
Through this group of prisoners,
which increases to ten, Miller examines
a cross-section of reactions to the night-
mare. Some are mere victims and do
not express an attitude: the boy is
too young, the old Jew is too old, the
gipsy is too ignorant. Of the others,
the Communist electrician has his faith
in the future to hold on to, and the
actor believes in appearances: he thinks
that if he can act the part of a man
who has nothing to hide, then he will
be invulnerable. The Austrian noble-
man and the psychiatrist, who are
men of ideas and have seen Nazism in
action in Austria, are the only two who
fully realise the danger and are able
to act, the one to sacrifice himself and
the other to accept the sacrifice.
In the early part of the play Miller
builds up the tension very skilfully and
shows the terror and helplessness of the
weak, the blindness and straw-clutch-
ing optimism of some of the others.
Charles Marowitz, writing in the
Penguin “New American Drama,” com-
plains that “Incident at Vichy” presents
a black-and-white moral conflict. Maro-
witz thinks that Miller should concern
himself with what it is in our own
natures that could lead us to slaughter
the Jews. But surely we have been
doing this for years? Miller is asking
us to consider, for a change, what it is
in our own natures that could lead us
to be trapped into concentration camps.
The moral of the play is that it is a
wise people that knows its own enemy.
Here, at last, is a play which is
ideally suited to the theatre-in-the-
Andrew Fleming (rear), Tony Ingersent,
and Kenneth Rayner in “Incident
at Vichy”
round: a play without props, intimacy
without realism. For once we are spared
that ugly sink and broken-down gas
stove which furnish the depressing kit-
chen in which most Ensemble produc-
tions seem to be set. John Macleod’s
excellent production, tense and con-
trolled, riveted my attention. Don
Reid gives a memorable performance as
the sensitive nobleman and Tony Inger-
sent is excellent as the bearded painter.

How to succeed
in funny business
By BEVERLEY TIVEY
How To Succeed In Business Without
Really Trying. Director, David Swift.
Thoroughly Modern Millie. Director,
George Roy Hill.
IT SEEMS that the musical is back
with us again. At any rate, there are
plenty of movies with songs and dances,
even if we don’t get the big production
numbers, the Albertina Rasch dancers,


or those aquatic ballets photographed
from the ceiling.
In general, the musical nowadays
concentrates more on plot development
and action than on those spectacular
“presentations.” Indeed, they often in-
corporate some sharp social comment,
like “How To Succeed In Business
Without Really Trying,” which gives a
pretty deadly picture of commercial life
without undue solemnity: I was con-
stantly amused and only on later con-
sideration alarmed by its implications.
The movie, which follows the stage
play fairly closely but not slavishly, con-
cerns an ambitious window-washer who
edges himself into a humble job in an
enormous business concern and in a
matter of days has worked himself
practically to the top by a judicious
blend of smarming, conniving, back-
stabbing, and even on well-judged
occasions •- truthfulness. He even wins
the girl he loves, though it’s made very
clear that this is a secondary con-
sideration.
The central role is tailor-made for
Robert Morse, who also ■ played it on
Broadway; the knowingness and calcu-
lation which make him a deft but
sometimes dislikable comedian are
here so appropriate, and employed with
such accuracy that they become com-
pletely disarming. A fine supporting
cast is headed by Rudy Vallee, won-
derfully funny as Morse’s bluffing boss,
and a very charming newcomer to the
screen called Michele Lee. Add some
jolly tunes, often with biting lyrics,
and Bob Fosse’s inventive choreography
(especially in the “Brotherhood of
Man” sequence) and you’ve got a
sprightly, swingy musical of the sort
I didn’t think they made any more.
We go back years with “Thoroughly
Modern Millie,” which is set in the
early ’twenties and reverts to the old
style of musical comedy, whose plot is
both over-complicated and idiotic and
is in any case constantly interrupted
by the necessity to give someone a song
to sing or by irrelevancies like Carol
Channing’s acrobatic turn, a Jewish
wedding, or an interminable sequence
in the Harold Lloyd manner of James
Fox and Julie Andrews clambering
round the window ledges of a sky-
scraper.
It’s a movie that would be twice as
funny if it were half as long, but direc-
tor George Roy Hill is determined to
wring every last ounce from every jest
though his only idea of conjuring up
period atmosphere seems to be by dwel-
ling on Julie Andrews’ wistful regrets
that she’s unable to achieve the fashion-
able flat-chested look. (Marilyn Monroe
and Jack Lemon made this joke more
amusingly in “Some Like It Hot,” and
didn’t feel the need to make it more
than once.)
The diligence of the hard-working
cast is admirable but exhausting, and
though Julie Andrews and Mary Tyler
Moore are hardly in the sere and
yellow they’re surely too old for the
flappers they have to play. Carol Chan-
ning dominates all her scenes by the
sheer force of her explosive personality;
and as the ultra-respectable white
slaver, Beatrice Lillie effortlessly takes
the rest of the players and wipes the
floor with them. Her ineffable delivery
of one comic line toward the end of
the movie gave me my one real belly-
laugh during the film.
Art
Arp and away
By ELWYN LYNN
Vernon Treweeke. Central Street Gal-
lery, Sydney.
Tony Bishop, Watters Gallery, Sydney.
Vincent Jomantas, Rudy Komon Gal-
lery, Sydney.
VERNON TREWEEKE’S paintings
are hexagonal, square, or diamond
shaped, usually of subdued and uniform
backgrounds on which cavort undu-
lating art nouveau bands which swirl
to and from the centre or which bind
tree and cloud forms that owe some-
thing to Caulfield and Arp. While the
shapes avoid the languor of art
nouveau, they don’t take formal risks
and in ordinary light the works are
uncompromisingly flat, but when the
ultra-violet lights and Indian music are
turned on, some bands expand and
glow, some colors disappear, and such
is the phosphorescent radiance that the
three separate forms that make More
Less than Less is More find a rapt
togetherness.
Indeed, the ultra-violet light gives
the works a uniform glow unobtainable
by other means and thus becomes part
of the artist’s media as it did with Col
Jordan’s recent three-dimensional work
at Watters; and it’s of interest that
ultra-violet light is used to detect varia-
ions of brush-stroke in oil paintings
and only became useful as a medium
when perfectly flat paint, showing no
signs of brush-strokes, became available.
Treweeke’s glow-worm cavern has
been compared to a psychedelic cellar,
Chartres Cathedral, and Venice’s St.
Mark’s; that would provide a quick,
cheap, and entertaining trip for view-
ers, but maybe there is not such a gap
between the Cellar and Chartres and
Treweeke’s glowing womb, because the
Flower. People, the Turned-On Folk,
and reverential tourists at Chartres all
share in Freud’s oceanic feeling of to-
getherness and all feel part of the
total environment.
“Total environment” was a phrase
used by John Olsen to describe the
artist’s immersion in the city scape as
opposed to Renaissance view of artist
as observer. Olsen was not talking about
an environmental brain washing but
about a painting where you accom-
panied the artist on an intricate and
infinite journey of seemingly chaotic
experiences, an approach allied to Pol-
lock’s. Olsen was showing what it meant
to be involved; what Treweeke and
others want is an instantaneous sur-
render to what Parmenides used to call
the ONE. In the psychedelic cellar
flashing lights dissolve walls and people
into a technicolor togetherness, and just
as cathedrals can induce a incantatory
numbness, so can most of Treweeke’s
works, which are a little dandified, as
well. What is admirable, however, is
the harsh exultance of his works on
diamond shapes with cloud and tree,
and his large Ship Trip Triptych,
which impresses in any light.
Are our younger artists growing sus-
picious of the sweet hue and the simple,
limp form? Dick Watkins’ recent re-
examination of abstraction of the
’twenties, Treweeke’s concern with
Arp’s precise awkwardness, Tony
Bishop’s glance at Naum Gabo’s tough
efficiency, and Jomantas’ turning from
monolithic forms to Ernst-like separated
objects would suggest that they are.
Tony Bishop, of Adelaide, where
there is a color-field group, has wall
plaques and free-standing works, almost
all based on discs, box-shapes, and
hemispheres. Aureola IV has three
chocolate-brown discs set in parallel
bars of stainless steel, and Aureola 111
has four of yellow-green; each disc has
painted on it wavy lines which imply
movement and you may rotate the discs
if you wish. In Aurora an overlap of
perspex, transparent discs rotates
mechanically between two black boxes
and does so with a refined uninvolve-
ment that one finds, too, in Which
Way Will the Sun Flowers Turn?
where three segments of a circle,
attached to a painting at their bases,
may be swung like window shutters.
It has an open-the-window-to-nature
feeling and so relaxed that one wel-
comes the bite in the row of scalloped,
purple teeth that cover a sharp green
expanse below a rectangle of grey in
DA DA, DE DAA. That he is on the
way to achieving a greater rhythmic
elation is clear from his set of nine,
pink bas-relief squares, the centre one
being set with a lively encounter of
white, three-dimensional Arp shapes. At
present he’s snared by symmetry.
It’s symmetry that Jomantas, a Mel-
burnian in whom some of Melbourne’s
penchant for biomorphic sculptural
forms is appearing, is abandoning,
especially in such fine works as
Awakening of Giants I, where four
laminated wooden legs, banded with
beautifully integrated pink polyester,
swirl like a cobra foursome from a base
like an inverted castle tower, and in
Giants 11, which consists of three
separate off-white, pale blue, and pale
pink undulating phallic shapes. It
sounds a little sickly, but the slow
rhythms and the genteel color are foils
to the subdued but persistent energy.
In Meeting of Nobles, with three
separated objects on a hemisphere, each
formally undistinguished, but cohering
with a slightly weird effect, he comes
closest to Ernst and even his off-white
plastic Sacrifice, with its overlapping,
interpenetrating horizontal layers sug-
gests a model for a future city designed
by a surreal architect.

bumbling confusion over her attempts
to marry off her daughter Lise to the
half-wit son of a wealthy farmer. Lise’s
affections are, of course, engaged else-
where, and her realisation of them gives
the ballet its title.
First staged in 1789 at Bordeaux by
Jean Bercher Dauberval it is seen
nowadays as a breakaway from the
formal pseudo-classical tradition, since
it has a plot of continuous action rather
than one used merely as a peg on which
to hang various ballet movements. And
its dances, flowing out of situations,
give it a contemporary quality.
The characters too, with their
touches of ridiculousness, were wel-
corned when they were first seen as
relief from the impossibly mannered
shepherds and shepherdesses of the
early pastoral tradition.

BOOKS
Shedding an Empire, with
splashes of rhetoric
By PETER COLEMAN
Macmillan. A Study in Ambiguity.
Anthony Sampson. Allen Lane The
Penguin Press. $7.50.
JUDGED MECHANICALLY against
the great events of his seven years as
Prime Minister of Britain, Harold
Macmillan would have to be called a
failure: under his leadership the British
Empire in Africa folded up, the Sum-
mit Conference he sponsored collapsed
(on the U 2 pretext), the British bid
to enter the Common Market failed,
and, at the end, the Profumo Affair
undermined the Conservative Party.
Yet this is to miss the point of the Age
of Macmillan. It is not just that he
nearly pulled it off and that, had the
Common Market bid succeeded, he
would have gone down as an historic
figure—the leader who took Britain out
of Africa and the Empire and into
Europe. He pulled off something har-
der—he converted the mood of Britain
from one of post-Suez panic and
demoralisation to one of if not con-
fidence at least “unflappability.” He
laid the necessary basis for Britain’s
final readjustment in the world. He
was the Prime Minister not of grandeur
but of style, not of Great Deeds but of
High Morale—and he at least knew the
difference.
There was little in his public life
to prepare people for the sort of Prime
Minister he became. He was expected
to be a stop-gap only, remembered as
a hard-working former Minister for
Housing, but otherwise a stuffy, aloof
figure with a “Daily Mirror” popu-
larity rating of 2 percent. Already
before World War 11, he was known
as probably the most academically in-
telligent man in politics (a first-class
degree in Honors Moderations at
Balliol), as a Tory advocate of
economic planning (one of the so-
called “YMCA” group in contrast to
the Right Wing “Forty Thieves”), and
later as one of the anti-appeasing
“Churchill Group.” But he barely
figures in the recollections of these
times and he remained another frus-
trated little-known politician who kept
busy in his publishing house, Mac-
millan’s (he published Keynes, Namier,
Carr, Cole, Yeats, O’Casey).
The Macmillan that Anthony
Sampson gets us closer to was known
only to friends the young captain
lying all day on the Somme with a
shattered pelvis, surrounded by the
dead and reading Aeschylus to keep
his mind off the shelling; the student
monk manque and friend of Ronald
Knox—called “C” in Knox’s “The
Spiritual Aeneid”—who told Knox
that he would become a Roman
Catholic (but didn’t), the young in-
troverted buccaneer, sporting a
monocle, who found in reckless ges-
tures his antidote to despair.
It was the war that gave him his
first real chance when Churchill made
him Minister Resident in Algiers—in
an American sphere of influence. He
set himself up in a “desirably vulgar”
big villa, launched himself into “the
big stuff,” winning Eisenhower’s con-
fidence, balancing de Gaulle and
Giraud, making a deal with Badoglio
for an Italian armistice (“I would have
signed a treaty with the devil to get
our boys ashore”), and committing
Britain against the Communists in
Greece despite an American opposition
which was quickly reversed (a pattern
he hoped to see repeated at Suez?).
He enjoyed himself immensely, all
the time gaily swopping telegrams with
Churchill. (When he telegraphed about
de Gaulle’s threat to resign, Churchill
replied: “You are quite right to play
for time and let de Gaulle have every
chance to come to his senses. See St.
Matthew, Chapter VII, verse 17; ‘Ye
shall know them by their fruits. Do
men gather grapes of thorns or figs of
thistles?’ Indeed the whole chapter is
instructive.” To which Macmillan re-
plied: “Doing my best. See Revela-
tions 2, verses 2-5. ‘I know thy works
and thy toil and patience and that
thou canst not bear evil men . . . but
I have this against thee, that thou didst
leave thy first love’.”)
But it did not last. In the 1945
elections the Tories were beaten and
Macmillan lost his seat! He soon found
a safe seat but he had also lost his poli-
tical faith and became convinced of
Britain’s irreparable decadence, a mood
that he never really overcame. (He told
Hugh Dalton in Strasbourg in 1950, “if
I were a younger man I should emigrate
to the United States.”)
When the Tories returned to power
in 1951, he got the Ministry of Housing.
“Winston asked me if I could build
300,000 houses in a year. I agreed on
condition I could run it my way,” and
became one of the Government’s great
successes. In 1955 Eden made him
Foreign Secretary, where he was not a
success: Eden certainly would not let
him run it his way; nine months later
he got the Treasury—and began to
talk of retirement.
Then Suez blew up. The most belli-
cose of Eden’-s advisers—he was the
Lady Macbeth of Suez. “Infirm of pur-
pose! Give me the daggers!” Macmillan
saw Nasser as Hitler all over again.
The Suez disaster destroyed Eden,
broke up the Tories, and demoralised
the country. But Macmillan became
Prime Minister, and. that night he sent
for Ted Heath, the chief Whip, and
ordered champagne and oysters at the
Turf Club.
Suddenly Macmillan, at 63 so
recently marked for retirement be-
1920 ... war hero
1951. .. Minister
1957-63 ... excitement on the edge of bankruptcy


came younger and stronger. He im-
mediately reversed the Great Power
policies he had formerly supported and
all his life believed in, and in Churchil-
lian language launched the final retreat
from the Churchillian empire. His gift
was that he saw the need for a Politics
of Gamouflagc and could supply it.
Pie made the collapse of Suez look like
a victory, and if Suez rebels like Cap-
tain Waterhouse stumped off to Rhode-
sia and Angus Maude to Australia,
Macmillan exploded Britain’s first
H-bomb to bolster Britain’s pride.
He surrounded himself with aristo-
crats and self-made millionaires (it was
only the serious middle-class, like
himself, that he did not like) and
in the following years, in splashes of
his rhetoric, Britain withdrew from
Africa (“the winds of change”), enjoyed
unprecedented affluence (“You’ve
never had it so good”) and tried to
export more (“Exporting is fun” the
least happy of the slogans).
He was never deceived (“If only
they knew,” he said to a companion
when the crowds cheered him) but he
understood and enjoyed his role. “It’s
exciting living on the edge of bank-
ruptcy,” he said, and he became the
popular unflappable magician who
alone could succeed in edging Britain
toward the contemporary world, away
from Empire toward productivity and
balance of payments. It is doubtful,
says Anthony Sampson, whether any
other politician could have made such
a dull transition seem so exciting.
Had he resigned in 1960, he may
have gone down as one of the great
Prime Ministers of the century. But
panache and unflappability can carry a
leader only so far. The camouflage
wore thin, the summits and the
Common Market bid failed, the afflu-
ence turned into a credit squeeze,
the unflappability ended absurdly in
the Profumo case; the Age of Mac-
millan suddenly ended. Bold showman-
ship could no longer be a workable
substitute for bold measures. The fact
that Britain was running down could
no longer be camouflaged by style.
Men like Macmillan usually do not
do well in the history books; he has
little to show for his seven years; and
he enjoyed debunking himself: "If
people want a sense of purpose,” he
used to tell journalists, “they should get
it from their archbishop. They cer-
tainly should not get it from their poli-
ticians.” He obviously did not give his
country a purpose, but in a necessary
transition period he gave it back morale
without which “a sense of purpose” is
a pretty fatuous set of words. The
value of Anthony Sampson’s book is
that he makes Macmillan’s achievement
as real as his inadequacy.
Dark hour
By MARIA WOLKOWSKY
Ice. Anna Kavan. Peter Owen. $3.85.
HERE IS AN extraordinary novel that
moves in a strange, glistening dream-
world of the mind the icy, rainbow-
lit fantasies chase each other, overlap,
dissolve, and re-form in a sort of
terrible compulsion. It is a story of
hallucinations which are made to appear
more real, more terrifying, and at the
same time so much more fascinating
Anna Kavan ... death-wish
than the normal humdrum planes of
existence.
The origins of Anna Kavan’s cold
nightmares are not, on the surface at
least, as easily identifiable as Genet’s
sexual “experiences,” but I would ven-
ture to guess that somewhere their writ-
ings share a common erotic basis. What
they definitely do share is the ability
to transform everything they touch into
a kind of poetry, to describe the sinister
in terms of beauty and to ennoble the
lowest human grossness with a gleam
of spiritual purity.
The author tells the fragments of
the story in the first person through
the mouth of the central character, who
is apparently a man. He is in constantly
thwarted pursuit of a frail fairytale-like
wraith, a thin, “glass girl” with
astonishing silver-white hair whose very
fragility and sensitivity has cast her in
the role of predestined victim. She is
the fluttering moth-type that comes
back again and again to be burnt by
the candle.
Through the narrator’s eyes we wit-
ness a number of disconnected scenes:
we see this girl dead, dying, tortured,
imprisoned, thrown from jagged cliffs
to a sea-monster in some ancient sacri-
ficial rite, or slowly crushed beneath
the weight of advancing mountains of
ice. Her deaths are many and frightful,
and they are embellished with details
that are compounded of part horror,
part gloating enjoyment.
The obsessed story-teller seems at first
to be there as would-be rescuer or pro-
tector as the rival of the handsome
black-uniformed villain known as “the
warden,” who invariably snatches the
girl away at his approach. There are,
however, several indications that these
two (the narrator and the warden)
could be one person, that is, two halves
of a personality which are fighting for
ascendancy. But this, too, rather like the
solution of “The Turning of the Screw,”
is deliberately left just ambiguous
enough for doubt.
The whole novel is placed against a
background of fear, chaos, and catas-
trophe: the advent of a new Ice Age.
Some nuclear disaster has so upset the
earth’s precarious balance that the
world is slowly freezing over. Militarists
seize their last moments to attack their
weaker neighbors, refugees flee aimlessly
about the globe. I have purposely re-
frained from mentioning this until the
end, because no matter how it is ex-
pressed, it must immediately arouse the
suspicion in the reader that “Ice” is
simply another, if highfalutin, work of
science-fiction. Even the cautious allu-
sion on the “blurb” cannot help giving
rise to this impression.
. Nothing could do the book less jus-
tice. This Ice Age is decidedly of the
mind, a projection of the subconscious
deep-seated fear that haunts all think-
ing people at some dark hour. In this
case it is perhaps a multiple death-
wish made manifest. It is certainly light-
years away from flying saucers and little
green men.
Like most works of art, “Ice” could
possibly bear many interpretations,
some of which might even surprise the
author. Its ultimate meaning is prob-
ably not as important as its powerful
evocation of atmosphere conjured up
in a surprisingly austere economy of
language. If there is a solution, the key
probably lies in the first line of the
novel: “I was lost, it was already
dark . . .”
The hate-fests
By FRANK KNOPFELMACHER
Teach-ins: U.S.A. Reports, Opinions,
Documents. Edited by Louis Menashe
and Ronald Radosh. Praeger. $2.45.
THIS BOOK IS AN account of the
principal teach-ins on Vietnam held in
the U.S.A. between 1965-67. As material
on the Vietnam war the book is, of
course, utterly useless. As a collection of
primary sociological data on American
academics it is quite illuminating. One
begins to see that teach-ins are too
important to be disposable by sarcasm
alone.
The current political risorgimento in
American universities, of which the
teach-ins are symptoms, is fed by at
least three different trends. First, there
is a group of frustrated courtier-
professors and their retinue, men who
were in Kennedy’s team of professorial


performing seals where they enjoyed an
illusion of power. Unlike Kennedy,
LBJ seems to respect intellectuals just
a little bit, and he leaves them alone
and does not prostitute them by flat-
tery and sinecures. This act of rough
decency has earned him the undying
hate of the unraped. Second, there
seems to be a curious claim emerging
from the American professoriat that
they have some sort of moral right to
advise and consent in matters of state.
This is explained quite clearly by one
Robert Buckhout, secretary of the Ad
Hoc Committee on Foreign Policy,
Washington University, in a letter to
McGeorge Bundy taking Bundy to task
for refusing to attend the Washington
teach-in:
. . . a scholar in whatever capacity
he may serve our society has an obliga-
tion toward the principles of scholar-
ship and that his transition from the
academic community to Government
service does not free him from this
obligation. As the Surgeon-General re-
mains a physician responsible to physi-
cians generally for the ethics and prin-
ciples demanded by his profession, so
members of the academic community
called into Government service as
academicians continue to have a
responsibility to the principles of
scholarly discourse. At the time when
the anti-intellectualism of the Eisen-
hower period was replaced with what
the nation (sic) hoped was a new era
of willingness to apply the principles
of scholarship to the basic re-examina-
tion of many of the tenets of our foreign
policy, there were great hopes that this
process would bear tangible (sic) fruit,
which now would have been visible. To
our disappointment and, we believe, to
the disappointment of the intellectual
and academic community at large, those
of its members who have joined in the
policy-making process appear to have
removed themselves from the system of
discourse which has made their new
position possible.”
An illustration of the “academic dis-
course” on politics betrayed by the rene-
gade Bundy is contained in a letter by
one Anatole Rappapport in support of
Buckhout:
“American fighting men, glorified in
‘Time’ magazine, appear to be modern
versions of the czarist cossacks. Their
bloodthirstiness, frankly and gleefully
spelled out, corroborates the parallel.
If names and dates were suppressed, the
leaders of these men could, from their
comments, be easily mistaken for the
SS.”
Third, there is the alienated Left,
bereft of its link with the workers
which attempts to turn campuses into
enclaves of insurgency against American
society.
The standards of most of the contri-
butors are unspeakable. And what is
quite outrageous is the fact that crude,
emotive tripe, which an average politi-
cal huckster would be reluctant to
touch is presented as reasoned academic
argument with consummate and curi-
ously open intellectual dishonesty.
There is one chapter which reads like
a .send-up, but isn’t, by the Berkeley
psychologist David Krech. In it aca-
demics from Vassar are invited to
cease acting like mere scholars and be-
have with passion, courage, and milit-
ancy —to be men. The following
advertisement seems appropriate: “Do
you want a real man’s job? Join the
military arm of the New Left at Vassar
College.”
The honor of the academics is saved
by a brief appeal of 20 scholars and
experts on Vietnam, in which they im-
plore their colleagues not to make asses
of themselves.
Changing emphasis
By NANCY KEESING
Australians Abroad. Edited by Charles
Higham & Michael Wilding. Chesh-
ire. $3.50.
WHEN SOMEONE HAS a splendid
notion about making something new
the resulting product is often so beauti-
fully logical that one can only marvel
that it had never been thought of be-
fore. An instance would be the in-
Gilbert Murray ... manners
Denis Warner.. . Vietnam
valuable rotary clothes hoist a much
less mundane one is “Australians
Abroad.” How extraordinary that be-
fore Higham and Wilding no one has
browsed among Australian prose opin-
ions of other countries.
Many readers will have seen some of
the books or newspaper articles of
authors represented here, but we have
not previously been able to assess, be-
tween two covers, anything like a
sequence of Australian views of the
world from the late 19th century
to the present day. Here we can watch
a changing emphasis in writing about
Europe and England, and a shift of
area toward Asia at the end of the
book. These and other matters are well
discussed in Leonie Kramer’s introduc-
tion.
In reviewing anthologies it is always
easy to grumble about omissions. I can
think of at least three but shan’t men-
tion their names and qualifications here
because I think it more important to
be grateful for the excellent and very
readable inclusions. There is much that
I, for one, would never have thought
of Hilda Freeman’s literally frenetic
“Germany, 1914,” for instance.
The only really regrettable lack is of
any piece from “the ranks.” All the
writers here (except, I suppose, Henry
Lawson) represent a well-educated sec-
tion of the community. People of
reasonable culture and objectivity are
not, of course, our only travellers, and
some others write very spiritedly.
The editors have included some sec-
tions from novels and some straight
reportage. (But what reportage!) A. H.
Chisholm’s “Berlin 1938” is superb by
any standards. A. G. Stephens “knocks”
Chicago and, half a century later, Allan
Ashbolt tilts critically at New York.
Mary Gilmore writes of the Cosme
settlement, A. B. Paterson of the Boer
War, Denis Warner on Vietnam, Vance
Palmer is in Mexico, Nettie Palmer in
Spain. Mr. and Mrs. Richard Mahony,
via Henry Handel Richardson, look at
Dover’s White Cliffs; Gilbert Murray is
bothered about his colonial manners in
an English school surely no school-
boy ever had less cause for anxiety
about anything.
Shapely lyrics
By GRAHAM JOHNSTON
An Island South. Vivian Smith. Angus
and Robertson. $1.75.
THE 35 POEMS in Vivian Smith’s
second collection, published 11 years
after his first, are nearly all short
lyrics. There are one or two attempts
at other forms satire in “Deathbed
Sketch,” for instance,. which makes
some mordant comments on “the sturdy
thinness of our cultural scene” as it is
exploited by poets manque who be-
come TV performers (no names, no
pack drill). But Mr. Smith’s accom-
plishment is clearly in the precisely
worded, evocative, shapely lyrics which
compose most of the book.
In one of them, “Dialogue,” he re-


veals his awareness of the dangers
which lurk in the mot juste and the
“brilliant image,” those successes of the
line and stanza which refuse to shape
themselve.s into an achieved poem. This
awareness makes it easier for the critic
to formulate the terms of his assess-
ment of this poet’s verse: “An Island
South,” I would say, has many verbal
felicities (and a constant admirable
craftsmanship) but not too many poems
which satisfy as a whole.
Those which do are mainly land-
scapes and seascapes, set in Hobart
and Sydney, which capture with exacti-
tude the look and feel of the two cities
and two harbors. The pleasure that
these and other descriptive poems give
is considerable, and akin to that of
good painting: one is gratified to find
quotidian Australian life in the cities so
readily making good verse, which make
the reader more appreciative of that life
as heightened by the poet’s selective
impressionism.
This selectivity is one of the most
marked features of Mr. Smith’s poetic
skill, and makes for a control and
lucidity, a general air of urbanity and
civility, which is valuable. And yet, in
an interesting way, this Gallic clarity
seems to be at odds with the poet’s
own inclinations. Underlying many of
the poems, and recurrently forcing its
way to the surface, is his fear of formal
perfection:
The inhuman has such perfect
clarity:
pebble and bone, light on the old
sea-wall:
lucidity that leaves life scoured out.
And he asserts:
It’s the abundant, varied, that
amazes.
Hence, we find, the task Mr. Smith
sets himself is at all costs to avoid
merely formal prettiness in verse,
merely formal replication in poetry of
the gnarled, resistant texture of exist-
ence. “Words aren’t wise,” he writes,
and the mind is a “disordered drawer
of borrowed knives” what is real
is “the patient strictness of the dew,
the slow intactness of the world.”
This Yeatsian insistence on dealing
with the growing tree and not the leaf,
the blossom, or the bole, means that Mr.
Smith’s most direct and effective poetic
language is a succession of minutely
observed images. In some of his poems
the image really constitutes the poem
and sustains it in its short life
“Despite the Room,” “In Summer
Rain,” “Beyond This Point,” and “Late
Autumn Dove,” for instance, are
genuine and pleasurable, if slight,
poems.
It is not easy to contrive the right
emphasis in judging Mr. Smith’s book:
the dominant impressions are the care
with which most of the poems are
fashioned, the pleasure they give (due
both to their matter and their art),
and yet their slightness.
MARION RAYMOND’S
COOKBOOK
Topping ideas
for end-of-year
entertaining
I DON’T KNOW if, like me, you look
forward with some trepidation to the
months of November and December.
Around this time of year I begin to
have nightmares. All my dreams seem
to be filled with visions of curried eggs,
salted peanuts, fried snippets of fish,
speared precariously on toothpicks,
ready to be dunked in tomato sauce—
and guaranteed to drip down the front
of my party dress. Or, even worse,
those ghastly concoctions of cheese,
pineapple, and maraschino cherries im-
paled, like so many banderillas, in some
inoffensive grapefruit.
I wake up feeling somewhat queasy
and, fortunately for my waistline, quite
incapable of eating until well into the
day; just dreading the thought of the
next cocktail party. I feel particularly
sorry for those who, at this time of the
year, are obliged to go straight from
work to cocktail parties. Often they’ve
had a sketchy lunch, and arrive, semi-
starving, to face a battery of gin-and-
tonics. What solace can a salted cashew
offer in such circumstances?
A much more appetising and satis-
fying effect can be achieved with very
little effort. True “canapes” are minia-
ture open-faced sandwiches. “Canape”
is simply French for “something which
is raised.” In culinary terms it signifies
something which is raised on bread
not soaking into it.
The art of preparing this kind of
food has reached its peak in Scandi-
navian countries. The Danes alone have
had more than a century of experience
in preparing smorrebrod, which liter-
ally means buttered bread. The bread,
however, is invariably hidden under the
generous topping. And the variety is
endless.
Anybody, I’m sure, can make appe-
tising sandwiches for everyday eating,
but to obtain true mastery of smorre-
brod culinary imagination, a good
palate and some artistic sense are
important.
It also takes some practice to get up
the necessary speed, as these delicacies,
to be at their peak, need to be
assembled not long before they’re
served.
If you are game to try to break
out of the salami-and-sardine routine,
I would suggest, for your first attempt,
a party that is not too large.
Essential purchases include a variety
of breads. Dark rye, with and without
caraway seeds, and pumpernickel are,
in my opinion, the basic necessities.
Most white bread gets soggy very
quickly. But certain goodies require
white bread, so choose a firm, crusty
loaf that can be sliced very thinly.
One other important point: cut your
bread in sensible pieces, and leave
those one-bite efforts for ladies’ bridge
parties. And for heaven’s sake pile the
stuff on; a solitary prawn is pathetic.
Next, you will need lettuce, parsley,
watercress, dill, and chives to provide
the appetising green touches. Slice
tomatoes, radishes, and ripe capsicums
for a touch of startling red.
On standby have sliced olives
(preferably stuffed with pimento), dill
cucumbers, hard-boiled eggs, and raw
onion rings.
Get all these garnishes ready in
separate bowls and cover with “Glad-
wrap,” while you tackle the main
ingredients. These will obviously be
chosen according to what you are pre-
pared to spend. Cold roast meats, pate,
salami and other sausages, ham, pickled
herrings, smoked salmon and oysters,
and chicken are only the beginning.
Remember that variety is the essence
of true smorrebrod: variety of flavors
and appearance, carefully selected and
combined. Have you tried smoked
eel? Pickled walnuts? Smoked roe?
Hearts of artichoke? Smoked tongue?
Even the butter can have its indi-
vidual flavors. Try making a smooth
spread with butter and a couple of
finely mashed anchovies, topped with
hard-boiled eggs and decorated with a
caper or two.
Butter flavored with a little french
mustard goes very well under pork or
beef. Place a piece of .crisp lettuce
under the meat, and add a prune for
pork and a slice of radish or cucumber
for beef.
Interesting varieties of mayonnaise
can be bought in tubes or jars for
decoration. If this looks like making
your creations too expensive it is very
easy to add your own flavors to small
amounts of ordinary mayonnaise. (A
dash of mild paprika, by the way, turns
your mayonnaise into a pink topping.)
Cheese should not be forgotten in
the preparation. of smorrebrod; the
Scandinavians are great cheese-lovers.
One of my own favorite party
smorrebrod toppings is based on an
Italian ricotta cheese now made in Vic-
toria (available almost everywhere, if
you ask for it). This cream cheese I
blend with a little fresh cream to make
it smooth, the juice of a clove or two
of garlic, some finely chopped chives,
and a dusting of paprika pepper. A
slice of buttered bread, covered with
lettuce and finished with a thick top-
ping of this mixture, garnished with a
few slivers of radish, is unbeatable. Any
“cottage” cream cheese will do.
Have fun at your cocktail parties—
and let’s hope we don’t meet over the
sardines on toast.


LETTERS
Are teachers overpaid?
As a secondary schoolteacher-
librarian, graduate, fully trained, with
additional extra-curricular qualifica-
tions, I strongly object to Eric Atkins’
comments (8., Oct. 14) on the work of
primary teachers. No more than super-
visors! I’ve never heard of anything so
silly. The whole framework on which
secondary-school teaching is based is
built on the primary school. I should
like to see Mr. Atkins teach 40 to 50
children at lower primary level. I did
once, while waiting for a secondary
appointment 43 Grade Ills for three
weeks—and as I am not professionally
trained for primary work I’ve never
felt so inadequate or worked so hard
in all my life.
All professional teachers have under-
gone training in the principles and prac-
tice of teaching at the level at which
they intend to teach: for infant and
primary work, from two to three years.
I have yet to meet the taxation official,
dental receptionist, or Customs in-
spector who has undergone, or needs to
undergo, before employment such a
period of training.
Entry to Teachers’ Colleges is highly
competitive. A Leaving Certificate in
six subjects, including English, is the
usual minimum prerequisite for infant
and primary teaching. A dental recep-
tionist is usually employed without any
training. Entry to the Commonwealth
Public Service (Fourth Division
Clerical Assistant) is by passing a
“simple spelling and arithmetic test” at
“sixth-grade” level. Mr. Atkins’ com-
parisons are therefore invalid.
Various factors influence the
student teacher’s choice of teaching
level. Some fully capable of secondary
teaching prefer primary work and
these people above all others command
my profound and awestruck respect.
As for reducing the basic standard of
education and professional qualifica-
tions needed for teaching at junior
primary level, this is the most extra-
ordinary idea of all. Mr. Atkins is
apparently content for children during
their most formative years to be “super-
vised” by untrained, poorly educated
personnel.
I suggest that if Mr. Atkins is on
sufficiently good terms with the head-
master of his local primary school he
offer his services for a week as “super-
visor” of a junior primary class. He
would then perhaps understand why
primary teachers deserve their profes-
sional status and salaries, and he could
add to his own general education.

Asia after Vietnam,
Thank you very much for publishing
Richard Nixon’s address (8., Oct. 14),
which, to put it mildly, was revealing,
and which will hold a special place in
history as reflecting the educated
American’s view of the world in the
late ’6os. It is a pity that it is unlikely
that a Chinese publication will reprint
it, for the Chinese could learn much
about themselves which they probably
do not know at present.
Two points stick in the mind. Dis-
cussing the economic plight of India,
Mr. Nixon says: “For the most
populous representative democracy to
fail while a Communist China, sur-
mounting its troubles, succeeded would
be a disaster of worldwide proportions.”
What a wealth of meaning there is in
those sentiments.
But his real message comes later:
“The world cannot be safe until China
changes . . . The way to do this is to
persuade China that it must change:
that it cannot satisfy its imperial
ambitions, and that its own national
interest requires a turning away from
foreign adventuring and a turning in-
ward toward the solution of its own
domestic problems.”
Surely one doesn’t have to be a
Communist or even anti-American to
see the irony of a leading United States
citizen saying that about China. In
fact, that paragraph should have been
included in your excellent section “All
Their Own Work.”

Apart from displaying the characteris-
tic naivete of U.S. foreign policy, “Asia
after Vietnam” (8., Oct. 14) high-
lighted America’s hope of Japan
assuming a greater Asian responsibility
perhaps we might be pardoned for
feeling a little hurt that Australia’s
contribution to Asian security was prac-
tically ignored, especially as not so
long ago the American Government
acknowledged Australia as her principal
ally in Asia.
Britain was the world’s policeman
for over 100 years; it has not taken
the United States long to become dis-
enchanted with the role she so eagerly
assumed about 20 years ago.
The interesting part of the article
was admission of the terrible internal
turmoil America’s conduct of the Viet-
nam war has wrought among her own
people. Only recently, and for the first
time, a majority of American citizens
have expressed dismay and doubt in
their continued involvement and
refusal to meet Hanoi to discuss peace,
except on American terms. Her policies
have been defeated in the United
Nations General Assembly, practically
all countries have censured her actions
it behoves the Australian Govern-
ment to re-examine our continued
allegiance to LBJ for may we not
be the only country out of step with
world opinion over Vietnam?
Now is the opportunity for Australia
to take a lead in Asia. She has some
influence with Washington; it is time
it was used to bring about negotiations
to end this war with its ever-present
danger of escalation by power-happy
generals.

Australian poetry
Alexander Craig’s article on Australian
poetry (8., Sept. 16) implies clearly
that he, like many others, proposes
remedies for it. He lists, however, five
“good” poets, and goes on to salute as
many others. In this he resembles other
recent surveyors, who have no sooner
done lamenting the poor state of the
art than they list a dozen stars of
supposedly the first magnitude. Who
is kidding whom?
Surely any national literature is doing-
well if it can produce half a dozen good
poets at one time. If Australian poetry
is conceded to be dull, the implication
that the best poets are themselves dull
cannot be avoided.
Rather than prescribe useless
remedies, I should have preferred to
see Mr. Craig hurl more and deadlier
brickbats, as well as bestow the sweet
mead of praise upon those rare talents
which enjoy his esteem; for it is refresh-
ing to hear the truth at least half-
spoken. What better can the critic do
than say honestly what he likes and
what he dislikes, contributing to the
fame of the meritorious and the
obscurity of the pretentious?

How nice of Alexander Craig (B. r

the “Poetic Establishment’s Younger
Set.” I’m pleased to accept. Having
made a professional job of labelling
me, he goes on to claim I “helped to
tie a label, a political one, on Vincent
Buckley.”
I have only once commented on
Vincent Buckley’s poetry in print, this
was in a review of “Arcady and Other
Places.” Politics were mentioned only
in regard to the “Eleven Political
Poems” and I didn’t choose Mr.
Buckley’s subject matter for him.
What’s more, I claimed to find them
socio-religious rather than political,
that they end with: “almost a denial
of political solution.”

trading partner, nor is it desirable. It
shows, therefore, very primitive thinking
on the part of The Bulletin when press-
ing for greater imports from Japan “be-
cause that country buys so much more
from Australia.” Japan is running huge
surpluses with a great number of coun-
tries, and I have yet to see a Japanese
Cabinet or the Japanese Press clamor-
ing at home in Japan that the Japanese
public should buy more from those
countries “because they are such good
customers of Japan.”
As for Japan being a liberal trading
partner on the world economic scene—
how about foreign investment in
Japan? I respectfully submit that highly
protectionist Australia is incomparably
more liberal by admitting foreign
capital to compete on equal terms on
the Australian market than the vastly
praised Japan, which, despite its
promises for liberalising the policy con-
trolling entry of foreign capital, keeps
foreign industrial companies strictly
outside.

Tearing into Tariffs
The letter from the Textile Council
of Australia (8., Oct. 14) follows a
familiar pattern adopted by protection-
ists one of patriotic righteousness.
What is the use of appointing Boards
and committees of inquiry into eco-
nomic matters if their findings are to
be repeatedly ignored? The shelving of
reports has been a common practice
of recent Governments, and primary
producers go to the wall through in-
creasing costs, whilst others fatten under
a high protective tariff. The situation
is infinitely worse when primary pro-
ducers have to contend with droughts.
We object that U.S.A. markets are
not accessible to us through a high
tariff wall. We complain about the
Common Market negotiations leaving
us out on a limb. We view with ex-
treme disapproval the U.K. investment
controls which deny us capital. Yet
we protect uneconomic industries and
we protect giants. This inhibits expan-
sion in industry and throws the burden
on the efficient and the defenceless.

Controlling kangaroos
Senator Mulvihill (8., Oct. 7) has com-
pletely missed the point I was trying to
make in the argument about kangaroos.
My point is that present methods will
never do more than control the ’roo.
I certainly cannot agree that the
Aboriginal with his spear was less
dangerous than a rifle and spotlight
As for “fauna carnage,” what of the
Aboriginal and his habits with a fire
stick?
It is commonsense to realise that a
professional shooter will shoot only
where ’roos are thick enough to make it
pay. Once the ’roos are thinned out,
the shooter moves on. In my opinion
this provides only a control which was
once provided by other hunters.

Educated women
In a three-page article on educated
women (8., Sept. 23) the word “hus-
band” appears once.
The frustration must be plain to the
husband, who may also be intellectual
and well educated, but who has to do
the daily round to feed his brainy wife
and her offspring, who are such a nuis-
ance to her.
These women might be happier with
something that is not taught anywhere

The RAAF misunderstood
Mr. Peter Isaacson’s article, “Is the
RAAF Misunderstood?” (8., Oct. 21)
might have specified more clearly the
main cause of widespread naval and
military misunderstanding of air power.
That casual phrase “. . . the Army
can only be successful if air superiority
has first been achieved . . . uses a
technical term analogous to the naval
term “admiralty”; it would be more
widely understood if the language con-
tained some such special word as
“aerialty” to convey the idea.
Sailors and soldiers neglect the prin-
cipal and primary function, which is
to assert and maintain aerialty: the
capacity to assert at will control of the
air space. This includes, of course, the
capacity to deny corresponding aerialty
to the enemy air force.
Until an air force has asserted
aerialty, its navy cannot assert admiralty
and its army will operate at a fatal
disadvantage, The development of un-
manned aircraft and spacecraft will not
diminish the importance of aerialty, not
even if these completely supersede
manned craft.
