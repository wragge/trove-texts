Papini
These new Italians are all alike in being
theatrical. Mussolini, D’Annunzio, Papini—
the three of them mentally skating on the
surface of events, and shrieking command-
ments as they fly hither and thither in quest
of alleluias! The terrible lure of consuming
Ambition has seldom sped-up men more tem-
pestuously than it has these three seekers
of fame greedy for power.
As I interpret Giovanni Papini he is as
Answerer a jack of all views and master of
none. In literature he is a would-be Musso-
lini gone awry. I can visualise him as a
soul tormented by the lust for greatness frcn-
ziedly “trying-out” first this and then that,
and missing honors each time. Not. in such
a heart the love of Art as all in all, before
which to bow low in humility and adoration!
Not here the radiant sense of Achievement
as such, in the spirit of virtue its own re-
ward !■ Rather in him the commercial urge
to get to the top—triumphantly there. That
it was in writing this man wished to excel
is his palliation. That his passion was for
philosophic pre-eminence is his catastrophe.
It is characteristic of Papini that his latest
hook should be all about himself, just as his
lauded Life of Christ is really a revelation
®f himself, with Jesus as footstool. That
fs one reason why this “Life” could never
be great; it is not Christ the reader sees
and hears, but Papini, cock-a-doodle-do-ing
of the author’s splendors— his music, his
magic, his might, and so ad infinitum.
Pick up Renan’s beautiful work and note
the difference of style, of effect —Renan never
seen, but just Jesus, whereas in Papini’s
rhetorical screening Jesus is a minor; even
all the preaching is Papini’s.
In the just-out IJn TJomo Finito —English
translation, A Man Finished (Hutchinson)
—Papini tells the story of the first 30 years
of his life. It is a blatant if fascinating
autobiography, with Egotism riding the high
horse . and Self-Pity weeping furiously.
Papini would seem never to have been other
than conceitedly colossal in reaching-out for
overlordship in letters. I can conceive him
an Italian John Norton furiously penning
adjectival Open Letters. Humanly speak-
ing, he does not appear ever to have been
a child, or ever to have played, laughed, sang,
loved. Stridently he opens like this: —
My fastidious friend, I warn you that nothing deli-
cate will issue from my pen as it tears across the
page. Would that instead of the pale ink that
flows from its square nib of steel, blood might run,
dark and smoking, such as drips from the breast
of the hero of a midnight brawl; would that the
steel might rend and scar the paper across which it
passes as it were red-hot, and that from the scorched
furrows it leaves an acrid but salutary smoke might
ascend to the reader’s straining nostrils!
The book is that note over and over. It
declares of the hero himself that “my one
love was the love of power; my one purpose
the possession of power; my one dream
power.”
So at 15 he started to compile an encyclo-
paedia to lick creation. Tired of it. Started
on a universal history. Abandoned it.
Started on a masterpiece of rationalism. Left
it in midair. Started on a history of litera-
ture. Tossed'it aside. Started on a rational-
ist commentary on the Bible. It followed the
rest. Says he, assertively: “Under that
shapeless greasy hat and that shock of tangled
hair there was a brain that sought to grasp
all thought, and that dreamt and reasoned
on all subjects.” His confession of failure,
however, is big; “Throughout my whole life
it has been the same—an eternal straining
towards all things, towards the universal,
only to fall back into the void or to sink
behind a garden hedge.” This is an illu-
minating sidelight: “I was always poor, the
poor and silent lad whom everyone avoided.”
Unhappily chasing impossible tasks, Papini
found no comforting compensations. He re-
cords that “the egoist’s life is a hard one ;
it knows Pot the protection of friendly walls
nor the calm of sheltered harbors, knows not
the grip of a warm hand nor any cordiality.”
Of woman he says: “If I am to be brutally
honest I must declare that no woman has
ever been to me guide, giver or inspiration.
They have taken from me, have asked of
me, and I have given them, a little of my
life, my youth, my time, my illusions and my
thoughts. But from them I have received no-
thing in return. The inner story of my spirit
has been neither enriched nor altered by
their presence.”
Apparently Papini drank —obviously not
deeply—at the well of every “ism.” Pessim-
ism, Monism, Anarchism, Occultism, all were
wanting, wanting. Incidentally, he planned
a scheme of mass-suicide that should “leave
the lonely and empty earth to rotate aim-
lessly in the heavens.” In the finish he
cried: “I am a thing—not a man. Touch
me—l am as cold as a stone, as cold as the
grave. Here lies buried a man who could
not become God.” That epitaph lingers in
the mind tremendously. Then, he says, when
Italywas saying that he was done, exhausted,
emptied, he found Christ. On that the book
ends. You may safely conclude that there
will be a sequel of I, I, I’s.
Despite the works he didn’t write Papini
did complete certain truculent books —one
of them, “The Memoirs of God,” a diarrhoea
of “blasphemy.” It is said that the war
changed him—that he read history back to
2500 b.c., and discovered that war came from
the absence of religion. His “Story of
Christ” made a sensation, selling by the
hundreds of thousands in Italy, next in
France, then in America and since in Eng-
land and elsewhere. On the strength of this
success Papini last year put into English a
volume of essays, “Four and Twenty Minds.”
It is a trenchant book, full of phrases that
cling and kisses that sting. Nietzsche’s life
is regarded as incomparable in its nobility,
purity, sadness, loneliness, hopelessness.
Papini can wield the axe. Maeterlinck is
“a fakir of facile marvels.” Herbert Spencer
is “the pedantic Hamlet of a half intelligent
and compromising bourgeoisie.”
We are to-day well in the thick of the
Papini boom. It was a wonderful inspira-
tion that turned the Signor’s thoughts to-
wards a new life of Christ. Where all else
fails the religious motif is usually a trump
card." Papini made the most of the after-
the-war rebound. In no choice did the superb
Adventurer prove himself so shrewd a judge.
He took no further chances, made no more
mistakes. He wrote pious platitudes, gaye
humanity the Beatitudes of Sophistry. He
assuredly proved himself torrentially elo-
quent—a master of movement, a conjurer of
color. He abolished artistic restraint and
reservation—knew what the people wanted
was the slap-dash of the whitewash-brush.
And he was made. He was crowned the
world o’er. He was Not thus fared
Renan. That writer of peerless prose was
branded heretic, unclean. Seeley’s “Ecce
Homo” frightened the evangelicals of his
time. But to-day those books are classics.
Papin i’s work can never be in their com-
pany.
Not that the Italian is unworthy as'
writer, for he is strikingly rich in the won-
drous use of wonderful "words that glisten
and grip. Some of his pen-pictures are as
vital as they are vivid. His imagery is as
arrestive as his imagination is fertile. His
“Story,” in a word, is magnificent journal-
ism. It is a book for the simple-minded
many, not for the complex-minded few. It is
not Literature. George Moore’s “The Brook
Tverith” of similar theme is by contrast
glorious artistry yoked with brilliant crea-
tiveness of conception. In circulation how
few its thousands! Yet in style how star-
tinted !
Thought is not Papini’s forte. Greatness
in literature is tbe marriage of Thought
with Expression. You cannot give out genius
unless it be in you. It dwells not in Papini,
Samsonian swashbuckler of the Inky Way.

T he Red Page
Editorial
The man of song went down the road;
And full of rhymes and dreams was he.
Ilis shoulders bore no other load
Save the harp of his minstrelsy.
But some were pleased to hear bis song
And gave him rings and cloth-01-gold,
And a silver chain that was as long
As his bowed neck would hold.
Not rich, but burdened, on he strode;
And with good grace he paused to sing
Where on a milestone by the road
Sat Malachy the king.
The king had water in his eyes
To hear the making of that, song;
A.nd sore he was and full of sighs
• For old things, thinking long.
He gave the singing man a place
Beside him that all men might sing
But by his judgment and his grace
When they should seek the king.
As he said well or he said ill
The kingly gifts were held or spent
And he had his own house on the hill
Made free of tax and rent.
So, listening to another’s song
And weighted with his silver chain,
The summer seemed too warm and long,
And his feet for the road were fain.
For full of rhymes and dreams was he—
And rhymes and dreams are restless •ware —
And little slips of memory
Came up the evening air.
But he sat there in his house on the hill
When the black asli-buds broke in Spring;
For surely, surely he had the skill
To know how a man should sing.
And he grew full of pride and grace
Until the song within him died ;
And they buried him in a quiet place
With his silver chain beside.
The king went down and down the road
To the milestone where he heard a song;
And his white hair was a heavy load,
Thinking long and long.

Catch Phrases
The catch phrase in the last analysis
is a kind of cant—verbal cant. In
England it often marks class distinc-
tions. The social sets have their own
characteristic jargon: you will see it set
out in the “Letters of Eve,” in the conver-
sational passages of such a book as Philip
Gibbs’s “The Middle of the Road.” In the
highly-differentiated social life of England
the catch phrase may even be the exclusive
property of a single family. Henry James
lias recorded such an appropriation of
phrases in one of his short stories. They
are on the whole, of course, coined phrases.
I knew a family in England with a large
group of words in current use that were
unintelligible except to the initiated.
After the war my lot was cast in the Lon-
don School of Economics, where a set of
young, vapid and doctrinaire socialists had
entrenched themselves. Apart from the tech-
nicalities of their talk, they had a reper-
toire of catch phrases shared by no other
group in the school. That is cant.
Even the flapper-typistes of Australian
headquarters in Horseferry-road had their
catch phrases; and if you had any dealings
with them you would remember them.
Australians are less addicted to catch
phrases. This does not mean that they
eschew them ; far from it. But such as they
use are national and universal. They do
not mark social sets or grades, as in Eng-
land. Just as Australians speak a common
tongue, with a common accent—as distinct
from the infinite variety of English enuncia-
tion—so their catch phrases are common to
the whole country. This, though it does
not except them from the charge of cant,
waters it down. The stereotyped phrase
connotes cant in proportion as it is the
shibboleth of a group or social grade.
These shibboleths probably were most
arresting in the mouth of the English Flying
Corps. The aristocratic fellows had a lan-
guage of their own which, when I left Eng-
land, was being grafted on to English domes-
tic speech. A London girl now speaks of

for dancing floors.
A WAX Finish Denotes Refinement
THROUGH all their centuries the beautiful interiors of famous European castles
and palaces, have known no finish but wax. Perfectly preserved the waxed
wood mellows and glows with the years. 7 his same beautiful finish can be easily
duplicated on the floors, woodwork and furniture of any Australasian home with
HING
Johnson’s Wax is the proper finish and
polish for all your floors. It will make
them beautiful —easy to care for—they
won’t be slippery—and will not heel-
print. And WAX is, by far, the most
economical finish and polish for floors
and linoleum. With waxed floors expens-
ive refinishing is never necessary, for
walked-on places can be easily and
quickly rewaxed as worn spots appear
without going over the entire floor.
Your Linoleum will last longer
look better and clean easier if polished
occasionally with Johnson’s Paste or
Liquid Wax. It prevents cracking, brings
out the pattern and colour and protects
linoleum from wear.
The easy way to wax floors
and linoleum is with a John-
sonWeightedPolishing Brush.
It spreads the Wax evenly—
polishes the floor easily—and
is an ideal floor duster.
n
Johnson’s Liquid Wax is the ideal fur-
niture polish. It imparts a beautiful, hard,
dry, glass-like lustre which will not gather
dust and lint or show finger prints.
Johnson’s Liquid Wax takes all the
drudgery from dusting. It adds years
to the life and beauty of varnish. Easy

doing a stunt at a theatre, or of walking or
cycling stunts. She refers to the parts of a
gramophone—or even of her knitting appara-
tus—as gadgets. She has the wind up about
prospective visitors and how they shall be
diverted. And a girl will speak of her
friend as getting into a flat spin, in respect
of a downright love-affair which began as
an aimless flirtation and was never intended
to become more. A bankrupt is said to have
crashed; and, in the case of a bad bank-
ruptcy, the phrase “under-carriage gone”
may even be added. But what was most
striking in the flying-men themselves was
that, once they had coined their phrase, they
used it more slavishly and with a more
generous lack of discrimination than any
Cockney. Anything was a gadget—the stars
in the sky or the wheel of a tender.
English people think a good deal in ready-
made phrases. The current phrase is wor-
shipped. The catch phrases are like so many
formulas; and they are formulas which cover
innumerable shades of meaning. “I felt
hopeless” may mean in modern England “I
felt sad” —or diffident —embarrassed —re-
proached—remorseful—unequal to an emer-
gency—despairing—or even resentful. It
may have a positive or a negative meaning,
as you please. Or, again, a suburban Lon-
don girl would speak of a perfectly ripping-
dress or song, an absolutely awful after-
dinner speech,- a beastly noise, a sickening
visit, an absolutely foul request (when ask-
ing a minor favor of a friend), a filthy flavor.
Even more arresting are the formulas of
the public-school men. I cull these at ran-
dom from their lingo: “Old bean,” “old
thing,” “old dear,” “a job o’ work,” “fed to
the teeth,” “bored to tears,” “the outside
edge,” “the pink limit,” “a thorough blighter”
(or, still more modern, “a thoroughly nasty
piece of work”). They dare not call a bath
anything but a tub. And they dare not call
a battle anything but a show —the Massines
show, the Beersheba show.
But Australians have their formulas. What
would the Digger have said of Marie An-
toinette but that “'She’s a bonzer”? (The
English author of “Kangaroo,” on his only
visit to this continent, was impressed by
nothing so much as Australian indifference.)
How many Australians express appreciation
of a high order by the nonchalant “Not too
bad”? And how many degrees of disapproval
do they convey by the simple verdict “Rot-
ten”? Australian speech is littered with such
stock phrases as “Too true,” “My oath,” “He’s
slipped,” “Cut it out,” “Cut out the rough, ’
“Rough as bags,” “How’s things?” “Dinkum
oil,” “Give it a spin,” “A rotten spin,”
“Make it a welter,” “Not too good.” These
catch phrases became crystallised on the fields
of France and Sinai as they never were at
home. But lam deterred from reproducing
the rugged economy of the formulas outside
their war-setting. Australians, as they are
a silent race, have not a wide range of ready-
made phrases. Englishmen, as they are
talkative (the tradition of their strong silence
is a complete myth), have an endless variety
of set phrases on which they ring the changes.
It is in the field of journalism that the Aus-
tralian outstrips the Englishman in his flair
for the ready-made phrase. The daily papers
of this country are simply shot through and
through with insipid formula —generally the
formula of description. To anyone here who
reads English newspapers this difference must
be constantly apparent. It is not amazing
that the traditional journalism of England
should be on a higher plane, as regards its
form, than that of this new country. And as
a better-paid profession in England it attracts
writers —even reporters—with better train-
ing. But that does not excuse the' crudities
of Australian newspaper English. The essence
of the language known as Journalese lies in
its use of the insipid formula, the lifeless cant
phrase. Writing that is otherwise bad may
be redeemed by its “nervous” quality—its
omission of what is ready-made. I do not
deny that English journalism is often so pre-
occupied with its manner that it loses
virility. It is sometimes verbose —and even
precious and self-conscious —in its striving
after form. (The work of J. L. Garvin
illustrates my point.) It may even, on occa-
sion, forget its matter in its manner. But
it is equally true that Australian journalism
too often forgets both. Not to put too fine
a point upon it, Australian routine journalism
is slovenly, where in England it is meticu-
lous. And the scamping consists in nothing
so much is in the use of catch phrases. It
is the short and easy way. I believe nothing-
more is needed to get rid of the catch phrase
than for editors to begin to take critical
notice of it. Some of the leading journals
of England—-including the Times and the
London Mercury— have lately offered their
active concurrence in a scheme of improved
spelling put forward by the Society for Pure
English. This means* that every page those
papers print will contain the revised forms.
The pains and precautions necessary to
achieve this are considerable. They are far
more considerable than those required to
eliminate from journalism the more hack-
neyed phrases. Any editor who made the
declaration firmly to his subordinates that
they must not use stock phrases would, have
done most of the work of reform in his own
field—so long as lie backed it up by dealing
emphatically with the worst offenders.
HECTOR DINNING.
Vance Palmer
It is a strange power, the power of a
name. Which of us in Australia, discuss-
ing our national literature, will not imme-
diately react to the names of Christopher
Brennan, Bernard O’Dowd, Roderic Quinn,
Leon Gellert, E. J. Brady, David McKee
Wright. Mary Gilmore, Dorothea McKellar?
Nevertheless, there are many writers besides
these who, without being so readily recog-
nised, have yet made notable contributions
towards the poetical output of our country.
Chief among them, and missing (I know not
how) the topmost rungs of the very highest
flight, I place, the name of Vance Palmer.
Here is no sharp, staccato-talking parrot of
the Muses, but a shepherd of Theocritus, his
cheek darkened with sun and rain—a man
who finds happiness in country roads and
pastures, living innocently, and extolling the
world about him in songs of natural joy. He
is perhaps of all our poets the one most free
of lettered artificiality : when we read in his
book we seem to move among trees, to smell
the blossoming grass, to watch the clouds
mingle with the hills, and to hear the smooth
and musical humming of the moon hundreds
of thousands of miles above us in the sky.
I have not always said so. In older days
I warmed myself over this writer’s prose and
knew his poems faintly (like flowers hidden
in a room) only by their fragrance. Then,
in 1920, Palmer published a monograph
barely exceeding a score of pages, and yet
all of it brimming with inspiration. The
deeper underlying thoughts in this new
volume held me with the inescapable power
of truth. I could not, if I would, deny
them. Llad they been written by an enemy
I must have forgotten malice and given rein
to my enthusiasm. Read “The Dandenongs” :
Blue hills that tower against the sky!
What dayspring life to you belongs?
Here where the bush lark weaves its songs
Amid the grass I lie
And dream that youth can never die.
And all is magic clear to-day.
The ringbarked trees are white as bone ;
Surely a man could throw a stone
To peaks ten miles away,
Or touch a tree-top bird at play!
The Sunday stillness of the Australian bush
lias never been more perfectly, or completely,
translated into words. The scene lies re-
flected in the crystalline surface of the verse,
and it is so fine and delicate in reproduction
that the smallest ruffle of air would destroy
the picture. I am lost in admiration when I
consider the sheer ecstasy of his fifth verse,
one of seven in a wholly remarkable poem:—-
What airy life a bird-note brings ! •
How lightly runs the buoyant breeze!
It seems as if the shining trees
Might move like wakened things,
And soar away on spreading wings.
No laureate anywhere in the world ever
thought more finely than this. The feelings
are the feelings of a child, full of belief and
beauty, and they are such that we sigh for
our own cynicism and mourn for the foolish-
ness of guile through fault of whom
young innocence was slain. The final stanza
of this poem I have deleted on my own
authority, because it adds nothing to what has
gone before, and, also, because I wish to
remain breathless —a boy upon the hillside —<
seeing trees
move like wakened things
And soar away on spreading wings.
Most of Vance Palmer’s poetry is written
from the heart; that is to say, although an
intellectual, he holds the balance between
passion and percipience so that the scale in-
clines a little always in favor of natural life.
Neither book nor brain will baulk the song
of his blood.
If there are any who doubt this man’s
capacity for thoughts- beyond a picture, let
them read—and understand —“Who Being
Dead”: —
Mourn for the myriad eyes that death has bound
In endless night: not those for whom the sun
Grew dark with anguish ere the day was done,
Darkened till in their separate hearts they found
Pity and terror, seeing a figure crowned
With thorns, and feeling foe and comrade one,
One in that web of suffering blindly spun
As in the common haven underground.
But they who watched the evil tempest pass
And saw not evil, drowning with trivial hum
The small voice speaking in the thunder’s quake,
Who watched their kindred flesh consumed like grass
And, being deaf and blind remained not dumb,
Those are the dead no trump shall ever wake.
Written during the period of the war, the
bravery of speech and truth manifest in the
lines became even more emphatic in those
days; although, at the present hour, we are
still able to remember and to commit our con-
sciences.
“Romance” publishes much in little: two
compact lines describe the torment of hostili-
ties, another two the inertia and ruthless
speculation of some who stayed at home: —
Youth herds in camp ano trench, the iron sleet
Hemming it round, crushing it in the mire,
While old men feast on battles by the fire
And hucksters raise the price of bread and meat.
A second verse prophesies the apotheosis of
poor, disfigured soldiers in times of eventual
peace :
Yet when our world is faded like a breath
Our children’s children shall lament the dearth
Of wonder in the peace that folds them then,
And turn from trees, and flowers, anu living men
To dream upon our days of war and death,
When heroes, tall and marvellous, walked the earth!
Language with so much meaning can hardly
be more beautiful.
Let me now quote you from “Easter,” a
poem terrible in its intensity, and managed
with masterful knowledge
Blessed .the dead who fighting die
Victoi'io'us in the blood and mire
In faith that the triumphant cry
Of life ne-w-born comes from the fire:
Life that shall mould the world afresh !
What though tornadoes round them roll
And thunders burst the quaking flesh!
They die with undivided soul.
The inspiration here is undeniable, and it is
only that we are spoiled vessels if we cannot
receive it. The mind is not allowed to
sleep: the verses fall, one upon another, in a
series of storm-crashes alternating with
moments of complete lightning. We remem-
ber “young men torn from the mill, and the
desk, and the mine”
shaped on the anvil of Mars
Into metal for wars,
Into rivets and bolts for the bastions, stakes for the
line
Shaped by a soulless god that is dead to pity.
Vance Palmer was doubly able to re-echo the
clangour of the bloody circus, coming to it, as
he did, clean and young out of a peaceful
land —a land of which he writes on his
return :—•
The hills are bright in the sun:
There’s nothing changed or marred in the well-known
places;
When work ior the day is dene
There’s talk and quiet laughter, and gleams of fun
On the old folks’ faces.
All wholesome short words; as English as
can be.
Now, hear the poet’s welcoming of a season
too slow in its approach:—
Spring ! You have tarried long !
Too long black Winter’s rime
Has bound the fields in sleep.
Now is our waiving time—
Slow-throbbing pulses leap
And chilled blood turns to fire;
The tang of warm earth brings
A flood of fierce desire
For far-off intimate things:
The eyes that watch the flowers
Dream of dead magical hours.
The face pressed to tne grass....
Remembers all that was....
To every bird its mate,
To every man his own—
This day no heart should wait
Sequestered and alone.
God bless such simple fervor!
This book ( The Camp, by Vance Palmer:
Sydney J. Endacott, Melbourne) is a book
apart, a book alone. One feels the authors
courage to be the courage of a whole world,
and his work to be very certainly man’s work.
HUGH McCRAF
In re Caesar ( Part Heard)
In his judicial examination of what he
calls the evidence against Caesar (R.i.
12/6/’24) “C.0.M.” is good enough to say
that he has been entertained by my remarks
upon that theme. The pleasure is mutual,
Both his articles have been for me matters
of pure joy. More than that, I cherish a
hope that, before all is said, our common
labors may even have added a little to the
gaiety of nations—or, at least, the discrim 1-
nating part of them that reads its Rea
Page carefully.
My critic leads off with the assertion that
when I say the first of his wonderful two
sentences (“There is not a tittle of real evi-
deuce that Caesar and Cleopatra ever met )
brings him up against Caesar himself, 1 am
saying what is untrue. And it is untrue,
he adds, because there is no statement in
Caesar’s “Civil War” that he and Cleopatra
ever met (the logical implications ot tins, it
will be seen, are very curious). Of course,
Caesar does not say they met. But he does
say that, when he got to Egypt, Ptolemy and
his sister Cleopatra were at Pelusium, that
he ordered them “to disband their armies, and
to decide their disputes in his presence, and
that the debate took place before him. If
“C.0.M.” sees no tittle of evidence m this
that Caesar and Cleopatra ever met, his nnnd
works differently not only from that of an
ordinary mortal, like myself, but even fiom
that of Froude. The fact that the meeting
took place is put beyond all doubt by what
A ulus Hirtius says in his continuation of
Caesar’s “Civil War.” Having made him-
self master of Egypt, says Hirtius, Caesar
settled the kingdom jointly on the younger
Ptolemy and Cleopatra, the elder Sister, who
had always continued under his protection
and guardianship.” The comments made by
“C.0.M.” about the authorship of the
“Bellum Alexandrinum” are unfortunate but
illuminating. It is the second supplement
to Caesar's “Civil War”—the “Bellum Afri-
canum” not the first, that has been’attri-
bated, probably wrongly to Virgil’s friend
Pollio. This second supplement had nothing
! ! t: Aiv/w-is nothin
doxically, in those days was not, m - > •
The alternative authors who have
gested for the “Bellum Alexandrinum, the
first supplement, are Caesar himself and his
most intimate friend, Appius : both, again,
T’rnhnhlv wrvm<dv
pronamy Y ron o iy. • j,
..Up, to this point I had been arnusi »
“C.0.M.” pretty well; but what really
“tickles him to death” is my assurance in
saying that Cicero mentions Cleopatra in
his letters. The arguments he uses anu the
position he takes up on this matter are
Froude’s. It is hard to credit, but it is a
fact that Froude, who wrote a monograph on
wqc . not aware of more than one
Crnsar, was not aware or more man one
refei ence to the. Queen . whether Lleo
patra or another—m Cicero s letters, bhe is
mentioned. I think, six times—certainly five.
In one place she is associated with Cleo-
patra’s son, Csesarion. In another, Cicero
rails at her through a whole paragraph and
says he hates her because she failed to keep
some promise she had made to him,
had treated him insolently when she was
living in her villa across the river, hive
words only, says Froude, are to be found in
Cicero’s letters that might possibly reixi
to Cleopatra: “Reginae ftiga rnihi non
molesta” —“I am not sorry to hear of the
Queen’s flight.” On these five words he
bases the arguments used by C.U.M.
I attain to my highest pinnacle of absur-
dity, according to my critic, when I cite
the historian Livy. The books of the great
“History,” lie says, that were relevant to
our subject-matter are now lost. Quite so.
But the whole work was in existence tor
hundreds of years after Plutarch, Suetonius,
Dio and the rest of them wrote their accounts
of Caesar, and was available to them. It
has been demonstrated by It. Pichon that
Lucan’s rhythmical chronicle, the ‘ 1 har-
salia” —which is a much earlier account of
the intrigue than Plutarch’s was (with, ot
course, poetic embellishments) based on Livy.
And we possess the work of the epitomisers.
Mommsen, who had more knowledge of
Roman life and history stored m his boot-
laces than Fronde and I (I will not include
“COM.”) could carry in our brains, has
not the smallest doubt that there was a
Csesar-Cleopatra intrigue, and that her son
Csesarion was one of the minor results ot
it. There is a suggestion that Caesar was
too busy in Egypt to bother about the lady.
Mommsen says that, among all his victories,
Ciesar seemed to value most those won over
beautiful women. Rice Holmes, probably
the greatest living expert on Caesar and liis
times, says the evidence for the intrigue is
not only conclusive but irrefragable.

Economical operation is still another advantage

Engine.
British built
QpSftpg T is a far cry from “the stately homes of England” to the
outback homesteads of Australia, and yet in one essential
feature they are similar. In this one feature at least, the
SMStrvk homes of many Australian farmers are as well equipped as
the country lodges of the Prince of Wales and scores of the
English aristocracy. The house is lit by a Lister Lighting Plant.
For, however their tastes may differ in other things, English peer and Australian
squatter, one consideration dominates their selection of a lighting pIant—RELIABILITY.
For the Englishman who is owner of some centuries-old ancestral hall, famous for its hospi-
tality, there must never be a hitch in such an essential of comfort as the lighting system.
Even if expert assistance is within a few hours call, a breakdown would be a calamity. He
must have the best, regardless of expense—and he instals a LISTER-LITE. For the Aus-
tralian farmer bringing to his home some of the comforts of city life, a breakdown from
mechanical trouble may mean several days’ vexatious waiting, several nights with smoky,
flickering candles before expert asistance arrives. His lighting plant must be reliable
although not the most expensive—and he instals a LISTER-LITE.
Lister Engines alone have earned the title of The Rolls-Royce of Farm Engines. No
words can express more clearly their undoubted supremacy in reliability, smooth running and
unnumbered years of service. The same dependability is built into every part of the
LISTER-LITE Plant. It is British-built throughout. There is a type to suit every country
home, hall, church or store. Let us give you full particulars.

Petals.
Out in the garden of words
We walk day on day;
And the petals rise like birds
And fly away.
Over the stones of the wall,
On the winds of thought,
They soar to answer the call
Of something sought—
Something beyond the light,
Beyond the edges of dream —■
Till on the straining sight
They are but a gieam.
And whether they fall or die
I know not at all;
For I have but a square of sky
And a square of wall.

The Lantern.
Green dragons on a yellow ground,
The Chinese lantern swayed;
There was a smell of ripened fruits,
A ukulele played .
The thin, sweet music of a dream.
I saw the fitful golden gleam
Of patterned light upon your face,
The pool beneath your chin
Of gentle shadow seemed to hint
At mystery housed within —
Your subtle, scented, swaying frame.
Your eyes green dragons on a flame!
In bamboo groves the rib-winged bats
Leapt forth from reed to reed.
Or scored the dropping purple fig
With squealing cries of greed.
“Grace before meat,” they seemed to cry—
Black pirates of the tranquil sky.
Breath of magnolias in the air,
Soft laughters from the grove,
Blue smoke blown from a cigarette,
Hot nights with nought but love!
And, swinging to the music’s sound,
Green dragons on a yellow ground!

Born Again.
The weather was right and the wind was
right,
And that was the reason we turned from
town,
And took to the track that the flower-men
And followed the long path up and down.
For over the hills and the hollows it goes;
Just where it pleases it climbs and dips ;
With bloodwoods ’tis bordered, and sheoak-
And bracken as high as a tall man’s hips.
The thrushes were voicing their morning joy,
Bronze lizards lay basking by pond and
pool;
Through sunshine and shadow the track
wound on,
And, oh! but the wine-like wind was cool!
No evil was there in that green, wild scene,
But all that we met with was fair and
good;
No blossom we gathered, no bird we scared.
For Nature had moulded our mood to her
mood.
The joy of the thrush was our joy as well.
The peace of the forest was our peace, too;
Our hearts w T ere as fresh as the hidden, flowers
That slumbered in shadow, still moist with
dew.
With cobwebs of worry our minds were
hung;
But, oh! for the miracle that befell—
Away went the cobwebs With all their dust,
And joyance was ours, too keen to tell.
Because of the thrushes that sang so sweet,
Because of the glamor of hill and glen,
Because of the flowers and the wine-like
winds,
Life’s worth and its splendor seemed born
again.
Henceforth, when I weary of slow old time,
And things that I cherish no longer please,
I’ll drink of the medicine, sweet and strong,
That Nature distils from her flowers and
trees.

Prelude—C Minor.
The spirit passes; stately, slow ascends
In solemn grandeur to the golden gate
Of paradise. Alone in silence wends
His way, majestic and deliberate,
His work accomplished and his task complete.
Behind him lies that path of life he trod
So long. Approaching now the Judgment
seat,
Unfaltering he moves to meet his God!
The chant grows richer, deeper; clear and
strong
It surges upward till the waves of sound
Touch Heaven’s high arches, till the triumph
song
With glory floods the utmost depth pro-
found.
The spirit passes'! To a splendid strain
Of wondrous music, silently he goes.
Eternity receives him : once again
The gates invisible behind him close.
Still the strong music rises, echoes, pours
Its rapturous cadences through time and
space,
Magnificently rings beyond the doors,
With sound ecstatic fills the holy place :
Then faint and fainter fades within the
walls.
Its golden harmonies arc hushed and cease.
Bong life at last is over; and there falls
A soft, sweet silence, and the end is peace.

£100,000 FOR THE GENERAL AND
A CAVE FOR THE SICK 'N.C.O.
No social phenomenon is more remarkable
in Australia than the anti-militarism which
permeates practically all classes. Setting
aside the Internationalists, who claim that
the Commonwealth should refrain from pro-
viding for its defence on humanitarian
grounds and who revile soldiers as mur-
derers, actual or potential, there are thou-
sands who, though they may not actually
express hatred of the military profession,
clearly dislike and distrust it, and equally
clearly are unwilling to raise a hand or
spend a shilling to foster it. Yet Australia
is situated very much as Belgium was when
the World War began. Our mandated terri-
tories and empty North are midway between
some of America’s chief Pacific bases and
the Philippines, which Japan would seize on
the opening of the hostilities that even
now threaten. In the event of invasion—
and the exigencies of warfare might force
either belligerent to occupy our territory—
Britain could be relied on to do her best.
But with the Singapore scheme dropped or
in abeyance her best would be little better
than the effort she put up for Belgium.
Belgium lost practically everything but a
strip of sea coast for many months, and this
country might fare nearly as badly for all
the help the British Navy could offer till a
dock big enough to take capital ships was
improvised. There must be some reason
other than congenital stupidity for Austra-
lia’s lassitude on the defence issue, and the
likeliest explanation is the incorrigible Tory-
ism of those who control armies, resulting
in a widespread conviction amongst know-
ledgeable civilians that the system in its
present form is too rotten and out of date
to deserve support. Soldiering is the Bour-
bon of the professions : it learns nothing and
forgets nothing.
* * * ' *
Some age-old conventions which maddened
the citizen-soldiers who did most of the fight-
ing in the late war, but which appeared right
and just beyond all criticism to members of
the professional-officer caste behind the lines,
concerned army methods of administering jus-
tice and of meting out rewards for good ser-
vice; and when the fighting ended there was
a fresh outburst of resentment against the
traditional treatment of incapacitated men,
thousands of whom had been induced to risk
their all on the ancient false pretence that
this was a different sort of war from all
previous wars, and that the treatment of
its heroes would also be different. The Dig-
gers were informed by authorities on Army
law that in Australia the A.I.F. came under
the Defence Act, that in Egypt and Eng-
land it was under the Army Act (except
that the Australian Parliament claimed the
right to veto capital punishment), and that
in the face of the enemy it came again under
the Defence Act. For practical purposes,
however, these were distinctions without dif-
ferences. Our Defence Act is very like the
Army Act from which it derives, and during
the war, with the censorship in vigorous
operation, it was difficult to tell the two
apart. The Army Act is the child of the
Mutiny Act, by which, as Blackstone
observed in his “Commentaries” a century
and a quarter ago, “soldiers are reduced to
a state of servitude in the midst of a nation
of freemen.” The object of the military sys-
tem is still to reduce the soldier "to a state
of servitude.” Not, of course, to strip him
of every right—such starkness would defeat
its own ends—but to deprive him of most
of those rights which he prized most in
civilian life. The right, for example, to be
tried by a jury of his peers, on any serious
criminal charge; and where his case is one
for summary treatment to have it adjudi-
cated on by a Court that knows its busi-
ness. The existing system of conferring
decorations and rewards belongs to the
period when a British king got the credit
for winning Waterloo without being there.
As_ the brilliant author of “Honors Easy”
pointed out, the surest method of winning
fighting decorations during fourffiftlis of the
World War was to keep away from the fight-
ing. Cairo, Etaples, Boulogne and Le Havre
were prolific hunting-grounds for D.S.O. s
and M.C.’s, but London was the likeliest
field of all. It is easy for the State to get
competent home-service and base-camp
office-men during a bloody war, and, once
the implications of front-line work are pro-
perly understood, the supply of those eager
to join in it perceptibly diminishes. When
the ribbon that Brown has won in mud and
misery, at the risk of his life and at the
cost perhaps of crippling or disfiguring
wounds, can be achieved with greater cer-
tainty by Smith at a desk, in a well-
warmed room, surrounded by all the ameni-
ties and none of the unpleasantnesses of
active service, it is not difficult to see which
path the average ambitious young man will
decide to be that of duty. The effect of
letting the base kings of to-day win their
Waterloos out of sight and sound of the guns
is to put a premium on shirking, and to cre-
ate a natural, but most undesirable, spirit
of exasperation amongst those who, will-
ingly or otherwise, are facing the music of
the bombs and “five-nines.” A successful
general may be granted £lOO,OOO and a par-
tially successful one half as much, while both
will get titles, for results which usually
are due to the work of a well-chosen chief-
of-staff. It is the mediaeval touch again—
another aspect of the fiction that the king
in London has done better military work
than the leader in the trenches. Like most
military conventions it assumes that armies
are institutions to which persons of position
or influence may still safely look for profit
and social advancement. The £lOO,OOO
general and the incapacitated ex-n.c.o. whose
bedroom is a cave in a public park are both
products of the same superstition.
* * • •
In the last year of the great struggle,
when public feeling was becoming danger-
ously tiro used on the subject of these and
other inequities, the military authorities
agreed reluctantly to certain concessions.
Trained lawyers were given the status of
“legal officers” and appointed to court-
martial tribunals “to assist the president and
his colleagues”; and it was decreed that
D.S.O.’s and M.C.’s should no longer be
awarded for service at bases. Simultaneously
the politicians renewed their promises to the
fighting-men : that the nation would not for-
get them, as after previous wars; that they
would be given preference in employment;
that their dependants would never want. It
is because all this old history is now for-
gotten by the authorities, and militarism is
back, to all intents and purposes, where it
was in 1914, that a war-enlightened public is
so suspicious, not to say resentful, of sol-
diers and their unchanging trade. Tell the
typical regular officer that courts-martial are
relics of barbarism and he will behave as
though heresy had been uttered. The fiction
is that officers only can deal with offences
committed in the field, and that a well-
trained officer is, at the worst, a partially-
trained lawyer. A century and more ago,
when rail and motor transport were un-
known and steam had not replaced sails at
sea, there was much to be said for active-
service courts-martial. And when army
commissions were monopolised by the rich
as their life profession, there was, anyhow,
a sporting chance that the president of a
court-martial would have a rough general
knowledge of the laws of evidence and pro-
cedure. Nowadays it is as easy to send an
accused from France to England as it was
to send a man from the trenches to a back
area in Wellington’s day, and the C.O. of
a regiment is likely to be a grocer, house-
agent or clerk without any pretensions to
legal knowledge. There is no rational argu-
ment against bringing all soldiers to trial
before the ordinary courts of the land (ex-
cepting, as aforesaid, those minor offenders
who elect to be dealt with summarily by
their C.O.’s), and there are many reasons
why the change should be made; the two
chief being that a military man is logically
no more in place on a Bench than a Judge
is in place in a battle, and that modern
armies have become sufficiently national in
character and developed in intelligence to
appreciate the point. Decorations won at
the Front should be sharply differentiated
from those won anywhere else; and it should
be established with regard to special grants
of money by Parliament that the cases of
poor heroes will in future be considered
equally with those of rich generals. The
invalid-pension question is tremendously
complicated, but one principle might advan-
tageously be laid down: that a nation is no
more justified in shirking its duty to those
who have suffered for it than it would have
been in skimping the war in which the suf-
ferers met with misfortune. The wars of the
future, whether on sea or land, will be
national wars in the widest sense of the
term, and it is hopeless to expect that they
can be prosecuteu successfully by adhering
to formulas which belong to a period when
armies and navies consisted of illiterate
slaves governed bv aristocratic despots.
THE AUSTRALIAN LOAN-ENLARGE-
MENT COUNCIL.
Tentatively, like seven partially-acquainted
cats on a roof, representatives of the seven
Governments of Australia and Tasmania
have approached each other and the great
loan problem. Through long neglect, shirk-
ing and casualness, it has become a very
remarkable problem-—so remarkable that it
is impossible to recall any country which got
into a hole of the same size and got out of
it solvent and in an honest fashion. The
matter presents many sides and many faces.
The State debts, which have nothing to do
with the war or the war liabilities, more
than doubled between 1912 and 1923. The
interest bill much more than doubled; in
fact, it came nearer to having trebled. The
pace showed an increase in the latter part
of the 1912-23 period as compared with the
early part—so much so that, while the aver-
age addition to the liability over the whole
11 years was 25 millions per annum, the
average for the first seven years was 18 mil-
lions, and for the last four 37£ millions. As
time goes on a smaller and smaller propor-
tion of the new debt is represented by rail-
ways and tramways, which are supposed to
be reproductive, and more and more by land
settlement jobs (they stood for over 53
millions in 1923), which don’t appear to
settle many people except in the principal
cities, and by “assets” so indefinite that the
Quarterly Summary doesn’t see its way to
classify them. Being so very indefinite and
various that the Statistician can’t have it on
his conscience to put them under “Rail-
ways,” “Tramways,” “Water Supply,” “Har-
bors, Rivers, etc.,” “Roads and Bridges,”
“Land purchased for settlement,” or “Public
Buildings,” he describes these loan assets as
“All Other,” and the exact amount of “All
Other” at June, 1923, was no less than
£54,724,000. The restrictions on the export
of real money are now so rigid that, no
matter how much may be borrowed in Lon-
don, none of it comes here save in the form
of goods which we ought to manufacture
ourselves in the interests of the local wage-
earner. The same difficulty applies to the
collection of any money owing to us in Eng-
land for goods sold and delivered; in fact,
it was lately estimated that there were 5U
millions of Australian money (borrowed or
otherwise) in London which can’t be got
at except in the form of goods. In the cir-
cumstances it looks like midsummer mad-
ness to continue the export of the compara-
tively little gold which the Commonwealth
still produces, sending it to a bourne from
which no gold returns; and the borrowing of
many other millions abroad in the 12 months
looks worse.
* * * *
It was amid these mixed conditions and
some minor complications that the represen-
tatives of seven Governments met the other
day, after the manner of seven polite but
non-committal cats on a roof, and opened
negotiations. The results were poor and in-
definite ; but, such as they were, the animals
dispersed to submit them to their respective
colleagues. They are to meet again very
shortly to compare results. The first item
in the report which was laid before the
public was that the parties concerned were
unanimous in their desire to restrict borrow-
ing. Possibly each State representative was
desirous to restrict the borrowing of the other
five, so that there might be more loans avail-
able for his own crowd; but the accounts
for 1919-20-21-22-23 show no trace of a
desire on the part of anyone to develop a
shred of economy himself. The increase in
the total liability, as well as the liability
per head, suggested that each Treasurer took
all he could lay hands on at almost any
price. A second proposition was that, “the
Australian Loan Council” having agreed on
“the loan requirements of the various States
and the Commonwealth for the year,” the
Commonwealth should raise the lot, giving
its own lOU to the lenders, and taking each
State’s lOU for its own security. This
should make borrowing easier, the name of
the central Government, and consequently
the support of all the six States which com-
pose it, being at the back of each and every
bill. It may also make it cheaper; on the
other hand there is no evidence that the bor-
rowing will be less, or the money be any
better spent. The idea, if carried out on a
large scale, must tend to make State default
less formidable, reducing it from the dimen-
sions of a world-scandal to a quiet family
arrangement. The Commonwealth has
already lent the States 75 millions or so,
consequently their lOU’s are familiar docu-
ments. The tentative bargain mentions that
the money is to be raised in Australia; but
after the trial canter, lasting 12 months, it
will be easy to continue the idea of putting
the Commonwealth’s endorsement on State
while dropping the restric-
tion about local borrowing.
* * » #
In short, the co-operative idea may make
matters better, but is more likely to make
them worse. So long as it gets the State
Governments more money than they consider
they could get otherwise, they, or some of
them, will probably co-operate, and when it
ceases to do so they probably won’t. The propo-
sition gives the central Government abundant
chances to incur new responsibility, and no
power to make the mudhole of finance any
cleaner. There is a way by which the Com-
monwealth might take —not merely ask or
negotiate for —a large and beneficial measure
of contx-ol over the six State spendthrifts,
and though the golden opportunity has been
wasted for a dozen years or more it isn’t
wholly lost. The establishment of the Com-
monwealth created a seventh authority to
dabble in Australian finance, and the estab-
lishment of the note issue gave it a fund to
dabble with. It had the opportunity to
give State loan expenditure a great boost,
or to institute a movement towards solvency
and economy. The latter could have been
achieved if the available money had been
devoted to buying up old State securities in
the open market, so as to provide a sinking
fund and a security against a remorseless
squeezing process on renewal day, instead of
being spent on the purchase of new State
securities, so that six Treasurers might have
about them the price of more crazy and profli-
gate drinks than they ever had before. In other
words, instead of creating 10 millions more
debt every now and then, the money might
have been used to create 10 millions more
sinking fund. The States might have had
fewer public works and jobs, and they would
in many cases be better off without them.
They might even have, under stress, gone
back to the ways of comparative honesty, and
have repaired the dilapidated road and the
decayed old schoolhouse out of revenue. But
the idea of a Federal sinking fund for State
purposes, since it implied an extension of
Federal influence and economy and (most
objectionable of all) was a measure of
originality, never got a hearing.
RECENT HISTORY IN CHINA.
There was severe depression amongst the
carpenters and stone-carvers of Shaohsing,
Chekiang Province, last year. The local
Taoist priest decreed that, as the feng-shui
of the district had been upset by the un-
toward action of some foreign capitalists in
erecting a factory dangerously near the
Wind-and-Water dragon’s tail, thereby in-
terfering with his slumbers, no houses facing
south should be built for the ensuing 12
months. As most people prefer a southern
aspect, the building trade has languished.
I mention this not because it had any par-
ticular bearing on recent history, but to
show the kind of ideas still current in
the land mat smilingly tolerates the Western-
educated Sun Yat-Sen, and to suggest the
kind of history such a China must have
“Foreign” papers, including those of Aus-
tralia, have a tendency to get mildly excited
over the fortunes of Sun, and recently they
granted him the honor of large headines on
the occasion of his alleged death. Lenin’s
record is the only one that can compete with
the Oriental revolutionary’s for multitudi-
nous deaths and resurrections ; but it really
does not matter very much. It is quite a
mistake to imagine that when Sun dies
republicanism in China will die with him,
because, as a matter of fact, republicanism
never got itself born in China. When Sun
inaugurated the miscalled republic 12 years
or so back, he went to the Ming tombs out-
side Nanking, rapped twice and informed
the spirits of the dead emperors of his pre-
sumptuous intentions, and apologised to
them in case anything should go wrong with
the new management. Our delusions about
Asia, and especially about China, are largely
due to our habit of giving Oriental things
and institutions Occidental names. A
trades' union in China is not a trades union
in the Western sense. It would be far
better to call it White Lily Society, or some-
thing equally exotic. The name would not
then deceive us. In the same way Chinese con-
stitutional government is not like constitu-
tional government as we know it? nor i s a
Chinese Parliament quite like an Australian
Parliament. Nor, for that matter, is a
Chinese M.P. quite like an Australian one.
He has better manners usually, as well as
very different ideas.
As an illustration of the different nature
of his conceptions the following story, unlike
the reports of .Sun’s death, has the
merit of being true. General Tang,
of Kaifeng, was a Yuan man, and General
Pang was a Sun man. But to be on the
right side of the fence whatever happened,
Pang affianced his daughter to the son of
Tang. Now, Yuan lost his life in a pre-
mature attempt to convert the Presidency
into a monarchy, and his party fell from
power. Whereupon Pang naturally re-
pented of his bargain with Tang, and tried
to get out of it. Meantime Tang’s son had
died, but that did not affect the father’s
rights over his prospective daughter-in-law.
He insisted on her filling the position in his
household —that of a domestic drudge—which
she would have taken up if his son had lived
and wedded her. Miss Pang had a strong
sense of duty, and, despite her Own father’s
passionate protests, she proceeded with all
pomp and circumstance to take up her abode
with the family Tang. After abiding with them
for a short time, she arrayed herself one
day in her wedding garments, and, proceeding
to her affianced husband’s grave, solemnised
a spirit wedding with her departed lover’s
spirit; that duly performed, she toiok a
draught of poison and lay down beside his
cold body, as much like Juliet beside her
Romeo as circumstance and crumpled feet
would let her. A people whose forefathers
for thousands of years used to bury live
widows with their dead lords to serve them
in the next world was not slow to recognise
the maiden’s action, and the Government has
been petitioned for permission to erect a
memorial arch to her memory. The family
Tang, as a result of the reflected glory,
regained their political ascendancy, and the
thought that he had at one and the same
time lost his daughter and contributed to
his rival’s fortune so galled the head of the
house of Pang that he ran amok, murdered
25 members of his family, wives, concubines,
maids-of-all-work, chauffeurs and cooks, and
then committed suicide, proceeding on his
way to the Yellow Springs so well attended
as to be the envy of all ordinary spirits
who had lacked the enterprise to arrange
their own obsequies before shuffling off this
mortal coil. What is the use of looking for
constitutionalism and other Western notions
in a people among whom such an order of
ideas is current?
And now there is very little room left for
the consideration of recent events. But the
foregoing will perhaps suggest why there is
really not much to record. There has cer-
tainly been a gradual clearing out of minor
leaders, leaving the final reckoning to be


settled between Wu P'ui Fu, the northern
general, and Chang Tso Ding, the Man-
churian overlord. Lo Yang, Wu’s head-
quarters, has become the real capital of
China, Peking being merely a painted-
mandarin effigy which wafts its head when
asked and opens its mouth for loans when
required. China is generally considered to
bo ripe for the restoration of a native dynasty
in place of the discredited republic. liussia
and China are rapidly joining forces as here-
tofore in defence against Western capitalism,
and Germany is coming back, regaining, it
may he important to note# more in prestige
than she lost in territorial power. The
people, as in former times, are taking to
banditry as the only means available of
expressing their grievances against their
rulers. Much of the disorder in social life
is due to the disruptive effects of foreign
industrialism, whose sphere is extending in
ever-widening circles from the strategic
centres provided by the treaty ports. Nearly
every province is planting opium, and some
commanders even pay their troops with it.
Another Christian general has appeared who
is converting his army by regiments; hut
the Millennium is not expected to arrive any
earlier on that account.

Theodore and a Prophecy.
By a political analyst:—
There is a boastful strain in Theodore, the loan-
mongering Queensland Premier. Hence his announce-
ment to the journalists with whom he surrounds
himself, and who write him up as if he were the
latest in beauty-actors, that “Labor will sweep the
polls at the next Commonwealth election” —with
himself as chief sweeper, of course. Before the pro-
phet can get his hands on the broom he will have to
beat Ferricks, M.L.A. and ex-Senator, for the Herbert
pre-selection, and that won’t be dead easy. Ferricks
is an extremist, but there are many extremists among
the cane-cutters and mill-workers of the Herbert. The
railway vote is also considerable, and Ferricks’s
opponent happens to be out of favor with the heads
of the railwaymen’s union. He and Larcombe, his
Minister of Railways, were bitterly criticised at a
recent meeting of the A.R.U.’s State council (Lar-
combe meekly attended, in response to a summons) ;
and in the following issue of the union newspaper
there was a cruel caricature of Theodore, alleging
that railwaymen’s interests had been sacrificed in
his surrender to the London capitalists, and, right
underneath it, a eulogy of Ferricks. Nor can Her-
bert be regarded as a certainty for the Labor candi-
date, whoever he may be. Although Labor has suc-
ceeded at every recent Queensland State election, it
has had remarkably poor luck in the Commonwealth
constituencies, where it hasn’t arranged the boun-
daries or made up the rolls. In 1919, for instance,
.t won three out of 13 Federal electorates; in 1922,
two out of 14. Not five months after the latter
debacle, with 64,000 more electors on the rolls than
the Commonwealth Registrar could find, and on its
own Redistribution of Seats Act, it increased its
State majority from two seats to 14. At least two
factors in this astonishing reversal of form will be
missing when the Commonwealth vote is taken.
The Opposition has 29 members in the present
House of Reps. It will require to hold these 29 seats
and gain at least ten more; and even then the
hypothetical Labor Government will be only two
votes to the good on the floor of the House. The
question is whether the thing can be done. Labor
will presumably retain Kennedy and Capricornia in
Queensland, but it has no chance of unseating
Mackay in Lilley, Corser in Wide Bay, Francis in
Morton, or Groom in Darling Downs. Mackay beat
the Labor nominee by 9266 votes, Francis by 7308,
Corser by 7190, and Groom by 5735; and such
majorities were not overturned even at the 1910
election, when the Labor vote was at the peak.
Moreover, Hunter is reasonably secure in Maranoa,
where he succeeded the late Jim Page ; he was 2121
votes ahead at the last time of asking, and Country-
party members are hard to shift. The Opposition has
better prospects in Herbert, Brisbane and Oxley,
where the Nationalist majorities were 1137, 1234 and
2406. Labor has won these seats before, and if
Charlton is to have the slightest chance of forming
a Government it will have to win all three again.
The feat will be difficult, to say the least.
Thirteen Laborites, 11 Nationalists and four Coclcies
hold the N. S. Wales seats. Labor lost Macquarie
and Calare in 1922 and gained Barton (from
Lam on d , then Hon. Minister) and Reid, a new
constituency. Macquarie it may recover, although
the electorate is very uncertain (Sam Nicholls got
in by 9 votes and was shot out by 85), but it
will take an uncommonly good man to beat Neville
Howse in Calare, where the Y.C.’s majority was
2603. Again, Cunningham is very shaky in Gwydir,
where a little-known Country-party man polled 11,914
against his 11,951, and the Labor majorities in
Hume and Werriwa, both capricious constituencies,
were only 1360 and 1431. Riverina once returned
a Labor man, but Killen had a balance of 1816
votes 19 months ago; there are faint hopes of Lang,
but it has never had a Labor M.H.R. and Elliot
Johnson ’s last surplus was 1945 ; and other adverse
majorities which will need to be wiped out in
divisions optimistically mentioned as Labor possi-
bilities are 4567 in Robertson, 4663 in North Sydney
and 4962 in Parkes. Before Charlton can go
Cabinetmaking he must gain two more N. S. Wales
seats, and where he is going to get them is a puzzle.
Two more seats will also be required in Victoria.
There the population is so distributed that 14 of
the 20 divisions are soft things for one side or the
other—Wimmera, Echuea, Indi, Corangamite and
Gippsland for the Cockies; Balaclava, Henty, Koo-
yong and Flinders for the Liberals; and Bourke,
Maribvrnong, Melbourne, Melbourne Ports and Yarra
for Labor. The Opposition has an obvious chance
in Corio, where Lister’s majorities have been re-
duced from 4800 in 1917 to 400 in 1922, and it
expects to make a better show in Bendigo, where
its last candidate was defeated by 869 after having-
been 3455 down in the first count. On the other
hand, McGrath scraped in by 224 in Ballarat,
Brennan by 553 in Batman, and McNeill by 407 in
Wannon. Wannon is really; not a Labor electorate
(of 26,261 primary votes polled in 1922 only 10,795
were for Charlton’s crowd) ; and if the local Min-
isterialists agree not to disagree, McNeill will go
out. There remains Fawkner, in which Maxwell
scored 12,472 votes and an Independent Liberal 1533
against the Labor man’s 9881. Fawkner went Labor
in 1913, and again in 1914, but Maxwell has been
strongly entrenched ever since.
Three more seats will have to come from the other
States, and there are only 11 available, excluding
those with Labor M’s.II.R. Four of the 11 —Barker
(S.A.), AVakcficld (S.A.), Franklin (Tas.) and Wil-
rnot (Tas.) —have never elected Labor men; a fifth
—Perth—hasn’t recorded a Labor majority since
1906, and in three others—Darwin (Tas.), Swan
(W.A), and Forrest (W.A.) —there were no Opposi-
sitionists in 1921, thei outlook being reckoned hope-
less. The remaining seats are Boothby, 8. A. (Min-
isterial majority 1861); Fremantle (W.A.), 2502;
and Bass (Tas.), 1460. On paper Bass is the
least difficult proposition, but the chances are that
David O’Keefe will find the going harder in Deni-
son, where he got home by 91 votes (he was 779
behind in the first count) than will David Jack-
son in Bass. Again, Watson, the member for Fre-
mantle, has shown some originality and force of
character, and men of that stamp (McLachlan, the
Lone Fisherman of Victorian State politics, is
another) have a knack of making the Labor machine
look foolish even in industrial constituencies.
Of course, a wave like that of 1910 might,
sweep the Charlton crowd into office, even though
Wan non, Gwydir, Denison, Ballarat, Werriwa and
Hume look insecure and there are heavy adverse
majorities to overcome. The party gained 15 seats
in 1910. However, many of the gains were made in
working-class strongholds like Bourke, Batman, Mari-
byrnong, Hunter, Dailey, East Sydney and Capricornia
—seats which might have been won before, and which
have never been lost since—and lots, of things have
happened since 1910. There is no sign of enthusi-
asm for the pacifist type of Labor politician, or the
pony-racing type, or the red-flag type, or the muck-
raking type—types conspicuous nowadays, though
rare 14 years ago. Many electors are obviously
weary,of stodgy old gentlemen who call themselves
Nationalists, but it is significant that they are not
supporting Labor candidates —the Labor-Socialist
vote has not increased to any extent —but are
staying away from the polls. Bruce and Page
look like being tougher nuts to crack than Mitchell
and Bauwell, who beat themselves. Indeed, Bruce
and Page will be unconquerable next year if they go
in resolutely for the Deakin and Kingston brand
of Australian nationalism, while avoiding the coali-
tion blunder that wrought De a kin’s destruction
in 1910.

Men on the Spot.
That frequently unsatisfactory witness and
often most unreliable source of information,
the Man on the Spot, has spoken again. It
is wonderful how little he is apt to know. If,
say, 20 men of long Ma State experience are
herded in a steamship smoking-room, it is
probable than 19 will swear that N.S.W.
rejected Federation by a decisive majority
until the Federal capital was fixed in that
State; a dozen will be assured that Canberra
is specified in the Constitution; 18 will know
that Captain Cook was the discoverer of
Australia; and the whole 20 will be solid on
the fact that Australia is such an over-
governed land that it has more members in
its seven Legislatures than any other coun-
try on earth. They all represent the en-
lightenment which may come through being
on the Spot. The present case is thus re-
ported :
Bishop Trower, with headquarters at Broome,
after 14 years’ experience of the northern areas of
Australia, declares emphatically for the introduction
of tropical labor. He says that both the waters and
land of the North only required development to put
out their riches. Keeping the area for the white
man only meant that this production would never
be realised.... The problem of development would be
solved by a system of indentured labor, by the Gov-
ernment allowing private enterprise* without State-
controlled opposition, and by the breaking up which
would come of the huge areas now held under lease.
What the North-West would be like with
plenty of imported colored labor the Good
Man on the Spot knows no better than any-
body else, because he hasn’t seen the place
under those conditions. Nor has anybody
else. Nor has he seen any similar place.
The world, indeed, is very short of
one-time empty lands which have blossomed
into prosperity according to the Bishop’s
recipe. On the other hand, no one has wit-
nessed the tropical North-West in process of
active development by the making of roads
and railways and without nigger labor; but
that very spectacle can be seen progressing in
a fairly large way. on the other side of Aus-
tralia, parallel with the Bishop’s diocese.
The only visible reason why a mass of white
population moved five degrees further north
on the east coast than on the west is that a
capital city was put up there, and even the
dullest and most stereotyped cleric can’t
prove that the process wouldn’t be repeated
on an equally large scale five degrees still
further north if another State and capital
were created. All the niggers in the world
don’t explain why there is a solid and grow-
ing population at Townsville on one side,
and practically a blank on the other. It is
a mistake to suppose, as many seem to do,
that nigger labor is in itself a remedy for
anything. The nigger, if he is to be of any
use to the world, is as dependent as the
white man on roads and railways to shift his
produce, the main difference being that it
is generally an inferior brand of produce. A
nigger without an outlet is no better than
anybody else, and he may be worse. Where-
fore this paper once more suggests trying
to supply the North with some more means
of communication, then seeing what white
men can do with it and them, and leaving
Colored Brother to the last.

Political Revolt, in South Africa.
On the eve of the general election an old
Bulletin contributor wrote from Johannes-
burg :
South Africa is fighting “The Revolt” over again.
Shorn of all the trimmings that go with elections,
the issue is the same to-day as it was in March,
1922. The crux lies in the encroachment of cheap
black and colored labor upon the spheres of employ-
ment hitherto looked upon as belonging exclusively
to the relatively dear white miner, artisan and
mechanic. This color problem of South Africa is
not merely a prejudice, no matter how true it may
be that white people in the main are color-prejudiced.
It is fundamentally economic. It did not com-
mence, as many suppose, with the introduction of the
Indian coolie to our sugar plantations, or end with
the repatriation of the Chinese brought here by the
mining industry. It commenced in 1658 when Van
Riebeek, as Agent for the Netherlands East India
Go., brought Malay slaves to the Cape of Good Hope,
thereby making 70 out df his original 100 Hollander
workmen the first white indigents. The descendants
of those slaves to-day throng the Cape, and have com-
pletely ousted white workers from many avenues of
employment. The later importations of Indians and
Mauritians to Natal, where they compete with whites
in every industry at coolie wages, and age found
efficient at clerical and professional work, have made
Natal a coolie country. And side by side with the
growth of this alien population has sprung up a
new race, neither black nor white, strong, virile,
industrious and intelligent, who are indigenous and
who, in the main, constitute the problem. These
“Cape Coloreds,” as we term them, are to-day
skilled workers in every sense of the word. They no
longer require the overseering which found employ-
ment previously for so large a number of whites.
But at the same time, while the function of over-
seer goes into disuse, the number of whites increases,
and so we have reached the point at which white
men similarly situated in the Southern States of
America became “white trash.”
As showing that this is no phantasy of the imagina-
tion the report recently issued by W.\i. Freestone,
Government Inspector of white labor at the Cape,
may be quoted. Dealing with white unemployment
he pointed out that the white man was originally
ousted from industry in the Peninsula by the cheaper
colored workers. To-day the colored man is being
rapidly ousted by the still cheaper black man, who
advances in education -and technical skill by leaps
and bounds. Hence the colored man is forced to
emigrate northward to the Transvaal and Or inge
Free State, where he again begins the process.
Another statement, issued by Warrington-Smyth,
Secretary of Mines and Industries, to the effect that
out of 16,000 white boys leaving school last Easter
not more than one-half at most could hope to find
employment, has created widespread consternation.
Commenting upon these reports the liberal South
African Review opines that \V a rr i n g t on - S my t i i is
too optimistic. The abnormal number of small insol-
vencies has a direct bearing upon the question, and
the fact that we admittedly have 150,000 destitute
whites, and a far greater number on the verge or
poverty, out of a total white population of 2 J mil-
lions, needs little comment. Yet our statistics prove
that we have lately grown enormously in wealth
and productive capacity.
The color question, then, is the crux of the election.
The solutions offered by both parties (for there are
but two now that the hybrid “pact” is in operation)
are about equal in merit. Both are merely elec-
tioneering- propaganda. The Smuts party proposes
to assist new industries to become established in
order to eventually absorb our redundant white
workers, meantime protecting them from starvation
in “relief” camps. The Creswell-Hertzog pact
proposes to segregate the natives, repatriate the
Indians who wish to go at £2O a head compensation,
and force big industry to employ a larger ratio of
whites to black and coloreds. The majority of the
white population, outside the wealthier farming
class, declares that things could not go worse than
they have gone lately. In the industrial centres,
such as the Rand, the pact slogan “Down Smuts I”
has caught on, and already there can be no doubt
of the result. The Communists are assisting the
pact, and, having the most popular orators at
their disposal, are fanning into flame the still
smouldering embers left from the 1922 “gevolt.
If ever there was a lesson for Australia, the con-
dition of S’Africa at this moment teaches it,

The Sort of Upper House that Might Be.
When the preliminary period of fault-finding
and personalities is over, and the legislative
institution at Sydney settles sown, with
a spoiled temper and a new crop df mean sus-
picions, to what is called business, the
reform of the Upper House is to be entered
upon, provided the scheme _ doesn’t again
perish by the wayside. Said House is a
nominee institution, and the last anomaly of
its kind left in these parts, though the
Uppers of Victoria, S.A., Tasmania and
Westralia, elected on a property franchise,
are anomalous in a minor fashion. The
reform idea is so old that George Reid
professed to fight a State election on it once,
and it is older than George ever was. Yet
the comparative, if not superlative, stag-
nation of the electorates could be changed to
excitement if a leader, neither too dry nor
too long nor too old, went to the country
with a species of reform programme which
could be presented. There is no more pro-
mising subject on which to make a stir. A
sort of ideal might be set up if the reformer
laid down this basis to work on;—
That the State Upper House should represent the
people, and the whole people, just as fully as the
Lower one, and more fully if the matter could be
arranged, the Lower body being under suspicion in
this respect.
That it should have the same chance of taking in-
young blood and getting rid of the old article as its
Lower relative, and should not consist of discarded
Lower House nun, rejected applicants for admission
to the “Other Place,” or obscurities, the reason of
whose arrival is as great a mystery as the grazing
farms at the North Pole.
That its members should be paid, and so get rid
of the nerve-racking problem of how an increasing
number of M’s.L.C. contrive to live with so little
visible support except their honorary .job.
That it should have opinions of its own, liable to
be revised by the people on election day (which
should be the same day for both Houses), and not
to be upset at a moment’s notice by the arrival of a
dozen or so of new life “peers” witli no representative
character whatsoever.
The most natural xvay to work out the reform
would be through the establishment of two
legislative bodies of equal size (the present
Assembly would have to shrink), equal pay
and equal power. They could settle their
differences by joint sittings at as short inter-
vals as the accumulation of differences
seemed to require. The new Council would
be chosen by the community voting as one
electorate, and being almost entirely proof
against gerrymandering tactics the contrast
between it and its neighbor might often be
remarkable —and illuminating. For the suffi-
cient reason that George Fuller is himself,
it is not supposed that his reform scheme
will be at all like this outline. The sug-
gestion is merely thrown out on the chance
that it may appeal to persons capable of
giving a push to the long streak of patience
and indifference who nominally runs Corn-
stalk affairs. The present may prove to be
something in the nature of a last chance.
There is always the risk that a party pledged
to one-House government, with gerryman-
dered electorates and a dubious ballot-box,
may arrive. Then it may dig itself in. and
find a way to do destructive things. It
might even make a success with the Profiteer-
ing Bill, in the amazing shape in which it
was once passed by the Assembly. This item
of the N.S.W. Labor programme is no longer
shouted on the housetops, but that may be
only because the time is inopportune.
♦-
The Campaign That Never Begins.
The chief buttress of venereal disease is the
fact that, while almost every reputable citi-
zen and newspaper is now willing to deplore
its ravages, hardly any public man or insti-
tution has the courage and consistency to
call for the only measures which experience
has shown to be fatal to its existence. Our
social reform knights mount their chargers,
couch their lances and thunder at the dragon
which has taken so many innocent young
lives, but as they approach it their eager
pace slackens, and, with apologetic murmurs
of “Decency forbids,” or “The Churches would
not like it,” they sheer warily off. The
latest to perform this disappointing feat is
Sydney Telegraph. Some time ago it
inaugurated what it called “a straight-out
campaign for a four-square national grap-
pling with the appalling evil and menace of
venereal disease,” and the inevitable I)r.
Arthur, M.L.A., was quoted as to the neces-
sity for "a vigorous and continuous campaign.”
The usual preliminary dash was made at the
brooding monster, in the form of a litany of
notorious facts —-that it is the direct cause
of most so-called “women's diseases,” and of
much blindness, insanity, etc., and the in-
direct cause of thousands of deaths yearly
which are attributed to other complaints.
Followed the recoil. If an epidemic of small-
pox appeared the Telegraph would not hesi-
tate to recommend compulsory vaccination
and rigorous segregation of the infected; if
bubonic plague broke out again the paper could
be relied on to demand an anti-rat campaign,
without regard to the feelings of property-
owners, as it did 20 years ago. But venereal
disease raises ethical and religious issues, and
ir is virtually pandemic. If the Telegraph
were to demand prophylaxis and the medical
examination of prostitutes it would lose the
support of Dr. Arthur as a moralist (he has
described such measures as “getting back
to the morals of the fowlyard”), and if it
called for wholesale notification and segre-
gation he would be alienated as a politician.
And unfortunately there are thousands of
Dr. Arthurs in prominent places. They
are willing to wound V.D., but are afraid to
strike at it. When the provision of prophy-
lactic outfits is urged they point out that
these devices, besides encouraging “vice” and
committing the State to the recognition of
it, are not infallible preventives of disease:
and to the contention that doctors should
notify all cases of venereal disease, they
reply that some doctors would be bound to
disobey the law here, whereas they would not
dream of doing so in a diphtheria or typhus
case. Any one of these objections is of
course sustainable. Vaccination is not an
infallible shield against small-pox. Some
plague rats might still lurk in a city after
the most intensive measures had been taken
to wipe their tribe out. But such varia-
tions fi-om the normal provide no case of
value against the broad proposition that in
certain diseases, where every known measure
of hostility is ruthlessly employed, success
must eventually result. Venereal disease
was reduced to a minimum in some of the
armies during the closing years of the World
War by the employment of methods that
could be put into force in civilian life, and
that would be worth the regimentation in-
volved ten thousand times over in the
improvement which would ensue in the hap-
piness and efficiency of the race. But that
glad day will never come until influential
dailies of the Telegraph stamp take their
courage in both hands, and, regardless of
clerics who are afraid of offending the
Creator, and politicians who dread embar-
rassing their afflicted constituents, treat Y.D.
as a complaint to be fought with the. same
weapons and in the same spirit as any other
complaint.
University Extension.
“Pollto” writes: —
The Senate of Sydney University says in justifica-
tion of its hostility to the policy of the Extensionists:
“The possession of a university degree, apart from
the training that lies behind it, is not so excellent
a thing in itself.” This is indubitable —if there is
any training behind it. But what training does
Sydney give? What association is there, between
teacher and student, or among the teachers them-
selves? Attendance at lectures, after all, is a very
crude and ineffective way of ensuring such contact
with others as a university should provide: it is
the constant contact of minds that is required, not
the intermittent physical contact of bodies in a
crowded lecture-room. Twenty years ago or more
professors had fewer lectures; being for the most
part unmarried, they did not, when lectures were
done, bolt from the buildings halfway across Sydney
to their homes ; they used their rooms for frequent
intercourse with the best, at any rate, of their
students, and their leisure afternoons for companion-
ship with each other. Then Sydney was. a; univer-
sity. Now it is a collection of heterogeneous tech-
nical schools.
The Senate, therefore, is practically claiming sup-
port for its centralising policy on false pretences.
In actual fact, Sydney is less of a university, than
Melbourne, whose colleges-—and whose broad-minded,
widely interested professors—give the resident stu-
dents at least more sound intellectual training than
all Sydney’s lecturers and specialists. But the
remedy is not to abandon all associationit is to
imitate London University by decentralising the
colleges. In the ’nineties Bathurst and Brisbane put
forward schemes for local colleges that should carry
country students through one or two years of then-
university course, instilling into them through per-
sonal contract with their teachers a corporate spirit
and passing the fittest of them on, full of zeal and
the power to me knowledge, to the central institu-
tion and its more highly-talented staff. A similar
agitation is making itself evident now--—more power-
to its elbow! Decentralise the teaching as much as
you can: one very desirable result will be that
examiners will have to test the candidates’ intelli-
gence, not their power of remembering a particular
lecturer’s phrases. But keep it as teaching, the in-
fiuence of one human mind directly on another. Book-
knowledge may be information, but it is merely
the raw material for teaching; to grant degrees on
it by itself—-well, the process was described to me
only too accurately by a famous but somewhat out-
spoken Indian professor: “We stuff the toothless
babe with masses of raw meat till he is sick. Then
we let him be sick all over a lot of foolscap paper,
and mark him for a degree by the size of the gob-
bets he expels.”
In reply to which :
This seemingly judicial utterance puts forward by
a side-wind the very policy with which the anti-
extensionists hope to kill the country movement. It
is pretty generally admitted that Sydney no longer
functions as a centre in which the best minds,
graduate and undergraduate, arc in constant contact.
The professors, their lectures delivered, have to
“bolt halfway across Sydney to their homes.” But
that is not to say that the University is failing
altogether as a cultural influence. It sets intellectual
standards, imposes discipline, offers rewards. Those
are solid foundations for self-improvement; and if
the ambitious N.S.W. undergraduate has to turn to
laymen for that mental friction which in supplied by
celibate dons in monastic Oxford or Cambridge, it
is possible that in many cases he does not suffer.
Most law students have relatives who are practising
barristers or solicitors; many medical students arc
the sons of doctors, and in general, even where no
relationship exists, successful professional men are

usually ready to act as whetstones for the wits of
really promising youths. Practically every man of
academic eminence in such centres as Bathurst and
Armidale has already offered his services in this
direction, irrespective of class or creed. So far,
then, as training is concerned —the enlightenment that
should proceed side by side with the spadework
of assimilating specific doses of knowledge—the
student who works for a degree in a country town
may be as fortunately situated as one who boards in
Newtown but sees nothing of his professors after lec-
ture hours, except their homing coat-tails. Nevertheless,
says “Pollio,” the correspondence-course idea is all
w rong: “the remedy is not to abandon all associa-
tion [with Sydney] ; it is to imitate London University
by decentralising the colleges.” In the first place,
it has never been suggested that “all association”
should be at once abandoned: Sydney will supply the
syllabus; examine; grant or refuse degrees in accord-
ance with the merits of candidates.; do everything, in
short, but that which at present it is not doing
adequately—namely, provide the student with cul-
tural contacts.
As to decentralising the colleges, the London Uni-
versity analogy is false. London appeared as the
outcome of a decentralisation movement, precisely
like that of N. S. Wales, except that it was directed
against Oxford and Cambridge; and the recent
astonishing growth in number and size of its colleges
merely indicates the hunger for learning that exists
amongst the poorer classes in the. world’s greatest
city. Begin correspondence courses in, say, Bathurst
to-day, and a university college will probably arise
there to-morrow as in Liverpool and Leeds, Cork
and Galway; to be followed in time by a minor
university, as in Durham, Manchester, Belfast, etc.
It will then be a matter of the city’s development—•
dependent on factors which are foreign to the issue
under consideration —-whether or no the colleges of
the new institution multiply, as in the thriving
centres of the old country, or decline. The country-
dwellers may fail —though it is significant that no
movement of the sort has failed elsewhere in
modern times—but every consideration of equity and
political expedience suggests that they should he given
their chance.

The Trade in Titles.
The Argus committed itself to a couple ot
statements last week that for innocence
or disingenuousness would be hard to beat: —
The idea that there could be a place in the busi-
ness world for a sort of honors broker could only
occur to charlatans, and would only impose upon
fools.
Persons who deserve public recognition do not
usually indulge in vulgar bargaining in order to
secure it. It is the unworthy individual as a rule
who seeks preferment by this means, and lie invari-
ably fails, because the only men who might really
help him naturally refuse to exercise their influence
in a disgraceful way.
A cloud of witnesses, including such experts
as the Marquis of Salisbury, the Earl of
Selborne and Lord Robert Cecil, gave
evidence before the English Royal Commis-
sion on titles a couple of years ago, and they
were unanimous that the lionors-broker did
exist, and that about four-fifths of the
titles conferred on business men in recent
times had been the result of his efforts. The
scale of charges for the ‘’higher honors
was mentioned: roughly, £lOO,OOO bought a
peerage, £50,000 a baronetcy, and between
£5OOO and £20,000 a knighthood, according
to the desirability or otherwise of the
aspirant. There is nothing either immoral or
undemocratic in the granting of real honors
for real services rendered to the State. But
in England the system had degenerated into
a device for keeping partyism alive, so that
it spurred the ambitious on to nothing wor-
thier than the making of large sums of
money, honestly or otherwise. And that is
what the situation was in N. S. Wales until
the change to which the Argus takes excep-
tion was introduced. Some of the most
notorious undesirables in the community had
either wangled titles or were in treaty
for them, while leaders of the professions,
and men and women whose lives had been
devoted to philanthropy and social service,
went unrecognised and without any pros-
pect of recognition in this direction. But
there is a legitimate objection to the N. S.
Wales method of applying the axe. If Mr.
Cann. M.1..A., instead of moving that the
King should not confer any more titles on citi-
zens of N. S. Wales, had moved for the
abolition of party government, he would have
begun at the right end. Unfortunately the
Trades Hall, which has nothing to get out
of the traffic in titles, hangs on to the party
system. In the circumstances the commu-
nity has cause to be thankful, on the prin-
ciple that half a loaf is better than no bread,
and it is justified in hoping that the N. S.
Wales example will be followed shortly in
other States.
“Sorrow of the Bush.”
The expression was used by a low-spirited
witness before the N. S. Wales New States
Commission, and it proceeds to turn up in
all manner of places. Certainly a great
deal of the so-called bush, thus described be-
cause so much of it grows very few bushes,
has its natural disadvantages. It is flatter
than it need be, and the rippling brook is
less frequent than it ought to be. The gum-
tree, too, with all its merits, is a homespun
herb, and not in the same category as the
baobab for impressiveness. But it is largely
the sorrows which man has himself made
that are complained off. The States have
created a new fashion in Country parties.
That of N. S. Wales exists, in part, for the
very wise purpose of splitting the big State
into smaller ones; but the most visible and
noisy present aim of Country parties in gen-
eral is to demand the admission of agricul-
tural machinery and motor vehicles free of
duty. This would destroy some promising
manufactures and reduce the number of the
customers who are of most real value to the
farmer—those who can be reached without
one-third the value of the crop being swal-
lowed up in sea-freights; nevertheless, a good
deal of the Country element has, for the
hour, got the importing craze badly. And for
the sake of the craze it has developed a happy
readiness to throw out any State National-
ist Ministry that it can get at, though
a Nationalist State Government has no more
control over the tariff than over the note-
issue. Then, not being able to make a Gov-
ernment of its own, which, if made, would
MODEST, YET AMBITIOUS.
“On his return to Australia Premier Theodor- (Queensland) said it would be preposterous if he
expected to get into the Federal Parliament and from the first pass over the heads of others who had
been working there for many years.”
THEODORE (to the Labor star actors ): “Mind you, I’ve had a lot of success starring in
the Queensland smalls; but I don’t mind going on as the hind legs of the
elephant so long as there’s a chance of working up to the head."
also liave no control over duties on agri-
cultural machinery or anything else, it tends
to put Labor in power out of cussedness.
State Labor, of course, can do no more than
any other local concern in the way of help-
ing the imposing business along, and there
is no evidence that it wants to. But it has
ideas about helping to swell the farmer s
wage-bill by extending the basic pay and the
short-hours policy to the bush. It has other
ideas—it has just been expounding them in
Victoria —about greatly reducing the farmer s
State Parliamentary representation, which is
generally much more than it would be if
matters were put on a coldly logical basis.
When this is done, Labor, which depends
mostly on the city trades unionist, will have
even less reason than it has now to worry
about the Sorrow of the Bush. The demand
for duty-free imported motor-cars turned out
by Yankee millionaire capitalists is based on
the view that one great Bush Sorrow is
lonesomeness, and that the cheap tin Lizzie
is necessary so that the settler’s family can
drop in now r and then at “the nearest town
20 or 100 miles away,” as one despondent
writer lately put it. The reason why it is
so far away is that the intermediate towns
with live industries have gone to enlarge the
metropolis, and the inhabitants whom they
should possess have gone to fill up slums. This
is also why the nearest town is a hamlet and
hardly worth visiting, and why the road to
it is so rough that the duty-free tin Lizzie
is likely to be a short-lived vehicle. If the
depressed country population would concen-
trate whole-heartedly on getting new towns,
which would probably involve getting new
States to put the towns in, and new “secon-
dary industries” to put in the towns, the
sorrow might be alleviated to some extent.
But in the main the country population has
proved a very torpid and somnolent prop of
decentralisation movements. Its inspiration
of the hour is that a bonus should be paid
out of taxes on all “primary products” ex-
ported barring wool. The principal ones are
already subsidised through being carried by
rail to the coast at far less than the cost of
carriage, but it is said that this additional
assistance is wanted, lest the “backbone of
the country” should subside into a soup-like
element, it is none too easy to decide how
the scheme would work in practice,
but it reads like a variant of the old
English device of subsidising the farmer by
paying part of his employees’ wages out of
the parish rates. There is no adequate sub-
stitute for a local market.

“Lex” : The trial of Auburn for the murder
of O’Neil ended in Perth on Saturday with
the conviction of the accused and a recom-
mendation to mercy on the ground ot Ins
youth. If ttiis stereotyped method ot indicat-
ing disapproval of some of the processes ot
justice had been abandoned in tavor ot a
direct vote of censure on the police, it would
have been more to the point. The detectives
admitted during the trial that they had been
with Auburn from 2 o’clock one afternoon
until 2 o’clock next morning. He had had
no food or sleep, and two statements had
been taken from him. So fully does the
Law admit that the average person—and
more especially one with no experience or.
courts —is not himself when first accused of
a crime that the police are required to warn
those whom they arrest against making com-
promising statements. A neurotic youth ot
the Auburn type could be got to say prac-
tically anything in the course ot 12 hours
cross-examination on an empty stomach. In
short, though he is probably guilty, the fact
remains that evidence was obtained by
methods that are contrary to the whole spirit
of our legal system, and they are methods
that might have convicted him had lie been
innocent. Unless action is taken they wall
yet be employed to ruin someone who is
indubitably innocent.

“Notseli.or” : If three candidates only are
standing for a three-member constituency
there will be no election, as all three will
be returned unopposed. That means that
the electors will have had no opportunity of
saying which of the three they prefer. Each
may belong to a different party, and to test
the' feeling of the electors —which is the
object of an election —a poll should be taken,
even if all candidates must be returned. But,
having tested the feeling of the electorate,
some use should surely be made of the result.
Having held an election, and haying (under
the proportional representation plan)
counted and allocated the first, second and
third preference votes; and having found
the electoral quota; and having taken votes
away from one man and given them to
others—having, in fact, gone through the
whole process, we find that the electorate
puts them in the order Smitii-Brown-Jones.
What happens next? Smith, Brown and
Jones all go to Parliament, and not one of
the three has a bit more power than any
other, although the majority of the electorate
said, perhaps in no uncertain voice, that
they much preferred Smith. In other
words, the three members have absolutely
equal voting power in the House, and Jones,
a minority representative, belonging perhaps
to a party holding a balance of power in the
House, may be instrumental in preventing
legislation ' of which the majority of the
electors approve. Proportional representa-
tion is not at present carried to its logical
conclusion, which would give the member at
the top of the poll more voting power in the
House than the one who got in with a
smaller number of votes. Such additional
voting power should be in direct proportion
not only to the total votes polled in the con-
stituency, but also to the total number polled
over the whole State. Incidentally, any in-
equality in the sizes of electorates would
then be automatically adjusted. Proportional
representation was evolved in order to give
the minority a voice in the House—or so it
is said. But it was never intended that the
minority should be in a position to govern.
In a House of 100 members the parties may
be divided 45, 30, 25. Evidently the electors
prefer the 45 party, but it cannot govern
without having a working agreement with
30 or 25. But if proportional representation
were carried to its logical conclusion the
members of the 25 party would have, say,
one vote each, of the 30 party two votes, and
of the 45 party three votes. The strength
of the parties would then be 135, 60, 25, and
the party most favored *by the country would
be able to govern without the consent of
either other party.

It grows wearisome to read that the N.S.W.
New States Commission took evidence at
Purgatory yesterday, and will probably hear
evidence at the rising town of Gravebottom
to-morrow. In the first place, it isn’t of
nearly so much importance as some people
imagine what any particular unit at Grave-
bottom thinks. The local member and aider-
man, and the prospective local candidate for
either billet, will turn up ; but most people
with ideas will keep away, because it is little
use expounding your case before a Bench
which can’t give a decision or a jury which
can’t bring in a verdict. It would be just
as absurd, but not one whit more absurd, to
hold a general election by sending a Judge
into each constituency to sit in court and
hear, from as many voters as can be listened
to in the limited time, whether each man pre-
fers candidate Fish or candidate Fow 7 1, with
a newspaper column of his . reasons. If
Premier Fueler desires to learn the state
of public opinion in the secession districts, it
can be ascertained very cheaply by supplying
to the electors therein, at next election, an
extra ballot-paper with a “yes” and a “no”
on it. Then the Judge, who is now wasting
his time, could stay at home and hang some-
body. But this paper begins to doubt
whether George Fuller is in earnest about
anything except his job, and peace.

POLITICAL
POINTS.
Commonwealth Treasurer Page budgeted
for a 1923-24 surplus of £47,000, and got
one of £2,657,000. The Customs revenue
exceeded his estimate by £6,100,000. That
estimate was prepared in July, 1923, and dur-
ing the ensuing 11 months shiploads of loan-
bought goods, on which duties were levied,
were imported by every State; which shows
(1) how impossible it is for a Common-
wealth Treasurer to hit the bull’s-eye with
his prophecies in a time of frenzied borrow-
ing, and (2) what a make-believe Australian
finance is.
The accumulated Commonwealth “surplus”
now amounts to just over ten millions. One
Gosling, a Ma State Labor member, has
coolly suggested that Page should lend it
to the Sydney Government, “at a nominal
rate of interest,” to “absoi-b” the Sydney
unemployed. Another proposal is that the
Commonwealth income-tax should be abol-
ished —and with it, presumably', the pay-
ment of interest on the war debt. But por-
tion of the “surplus” was eai*marked for
the redemption of Hughes’s gratuity bonds,
and most of what is left will be required for
the purchase of the two 10,000-ton crusiers
on which the Government has decided, and
which are all the more necessary since it was
discovered that the Washington Pact does
not apply to those parts of Australia not
washed by the Pacific. The Government’s
original idea was to have one of these cruis-
ers built in Britain and the other at Cocka-
too Island, Sydney, conditionally upon guar-
antees being furnished that the Australian-
constructed craft wouldn’t be obsolete when
completed. Now there is a notion of getting
both vessels from Britain and applying the
difference between British and Australian
costs to the provision of a floating dock
at Cockatoo.
After all the Labor howls about the wicked
distribution of seats in Victoria, the 28 Labor
members represent 309,804 electors, an aver-
age of 11,065, whereas the 23 Lib.-Nationalist
represent 353,533 electors, an average of
15,371. Somehow Labor-Socialism always
seems to profit by electoral distributions.
When in office it fixes the boundaries to suit
itself. When in Opposition it unites with
the customary malcontents to destroy' the
other side’s redistribution proposals, and gets
support by raising the one-vote-one-value cry
while retaining its pocket boi-oughs.
The United States has readjusted its
“quota” system. Under the new arrange-
ment only 121 Australians can enter Uncle
Sam’s territory, except as visitors, in a year,
while the Irish Free State, with only a shade
oyer half Australia’s population, may send
28,567. Australia never gave the U.S. any
bother or annoyance, whereas the Irish have
been a turbulent element ever since one of
the race founded Tammany Hall. Also,
Australia buys more from Uncle in any ordi-
nary year than from all other foreign coun-
tries put together, and more than from all
the British Empire outside the United King-
dom. It is really time some discrimination
was instituted against our arrogant bad cus-
tomer across the Pacific —just to remind him
of our existence.
An amazing slab of misinformation from a
Labor paper’s review of the Victorian elec-
tion results:—
In the great industrial electorates, where Labor
holds sway, the number of electors in each seat
ranges to as high as 63,000, while in the outside
districts, where the anti-Labor parties can most
successfully exercise their faculties of deception, the
number of electors who constitute an electorate sinks
to as low as 5800. Under such conditions it is
impossible for Labor to obtain a majority in Parlia-
ment.
In point of fact, the only district with
63,000 electors (63,123 actually) is Boroon-
dara, which Labor didn’t contest, for good
and sufficient reasons. The next most popu-
lous constituency is Labor Jika .Tika, with
41,548 electors; then come Essendon, with
37,039 (it was a Ministerial seat till June
26), Nationalist St. Kilda (35,932), Nation-
alist Hawthorn (32,143) and Liberal Brigh-
ton (30,536). At the very bottom of the
list is Grenville (4256 electors), which re-
turned a Labor member, as also did Warren-
lieip (5192), Daylesford (6185), Mary-
borough (6360), Dalliousie (6704), Port
Fairy (7313), Melbourne (7738), Bendigo
East (8204), Dundas (8256), Bendigo West
(9017) and Glenelg (9022). So far from its
being “impossible for Labor to obtain a
majority in Parliament,” the distribution
admitted of the party winning a majority of
seats with a minority of ballot-papei’s. The
minority vote it polled didn’t happen to be
big enough. 1
Not even the most clamorous Psalms of
David banged the timbrel in a louder key
than Premier Theodore when he arrived back
with Queensland’s big loan renewed at last,
though at a pretty stiff rate, with a discount
thrown in. What he doesn’t mention is that
it would have been a fearsome risk for John
Bull to refuse to renew the £25,000,000 loan
that was falling due, seeing there was only
one other spot in the world where a dis-
tracted Premier might have got the money,
EASING HIS BURDEN.
“The State expenditure in N. S. Wales for the year ended June 30 was £37,360,210, as against
£21,553 405 six years previously; and as the revenue exceeded the expenditure by £100,391, the Gov-
ernment will make proposals for a reduction of taxation. There is still, however, an accumulated
deficiency of £2,775,000.”
THE POLITICIAN: “Buck up, old man, we’ve got great news for you. We’re going to
lighten your load by cutting off one of your waistcoat-buttons."
THE BURDEN- BEARER: “Yes —and then you’ll sew a couple more on my pants, if I know
you.”
and time was short, and, failing that spot,
refusal would have brought the whole edi-
fice of Queensland’s finance down like a
drizzle of decomposed elephants on ,T. Bull’s
own head. John renewed to avoid the fate
of Samson. But he didn’t feel it necessary
to kiss Theodore at parting.
“Xox”: Whilst surveying his casualties
at the recent election, Alex. Peacock, of Vic-
toria, derives comfort from the thought that
most of the losses are temporary. Bulla was
won for Labor by Hjorth, a popular Bacchus
Marsh resident, but he collected his small
majority from the second preferences of the
F.U. candidate. Essendon has gone over to
the Trades Hall, but with more organisation
it should haul down the banner of Prender-
gast on the next appeal to the country. And
the rejection of Dr. Fetherston, * sometime
local Health Officer, doesn’t represent the
true feelings of Prahran. Wrangling in the
local branch of the Nationalist Federation
led to vote-splitting, and the apathy of
Fetherston’s prosperous supporters did the
rest. The tiny Labor majority at Daylesford
can easily be wiped out, and the result of
the Ballarat East scramble is so close to a
draw that it may be upset on the appeal by
the old-established McGregor, who asserts
that he was beaten by the “cemetery vote.”
On the whole, Prendergast has little to crow
about.
When Theodore, of Queensland, returned
the other day it was almost as a conquering
hero, instead of as one who had got his State
into a shocking mess and had merely managed
to buy it out again. While the utterly
false limelight was playing', Thepdore pat-
ronisingly announced that his services would
next be at the disposal of Australia. Prob-
ably railway earnings are as good a test as
any of a State’s prosperity or otherwise;
wherefore this comparison is interesting: —

Why Australia should angle for a man who
can do that badly isn’t obvious.
For the time being, at any rate, capital
punishment has been quietly abolished in
S.A. by the reprieve just given to Hori
Morse, * a young Maorilander who travelled
from Sydney to Adelaide to overtake a
woman who had left him to return to her
husband in England, and shot her dead
at sight. The jury made no recommenda-
tion to mercy, and it is difficult to see how
anyone can ever be deservedly hanged if
Morse is held not to have deserved it. How-
ever, there was the usual agitation for a
reprieve, partly by consistent abolitionists
and partiv by hysterical women; and the
Labor party gets a lot of its support from
that quarter.
“Clifford Snook”: As a matter of simple
justice I suggest that a country should be
allowed to protect its good name by civil or
criminal proceedings, acting through its
guardian or legal representative. For in-
stance, a coarse and violent liar lately
cabled to England for British Government
funds, on the pretence that thousands of
British migrants were perishing in Sydney
streets, and that, so brutish was the Govern-
ment and so iron-hearted the people, there
was no help for them. A slanderer like that
should be called on to prove his case, it
being a matter not of opinion but of fact,
and easily put to evidence. Failing proof
three years might meet the case, or perhaps
live, on the ground that it was not only a
gross slander, but an attempt to raise money
by false pretences.
Dear Bulletin,— -I had a dream the other
night. It seemed to me that the Presby-
terian Church was run on political lines, so
that when the General Assembly met there
was naturally a Government party and an
Opposition. The Government parsons, of
course, had the best city" churches, while the
Opposition ones preached in the wooden
shacks of the Backblocks. The latter were
an embittered crowd, for there hadn’t
been a change for years. To bring on a
crisis the Leader of the Opposition moved a
vote of disbelief in the Scripture, and after
an angry debate of two weeks the Holy
Volume was declared no good by three votes.
No disrespect was intended, and the Opposi-
tion man didn’t mean anything—no more
than a political leader does. But the losing
reverends had to start in greht rage for the
bush, and when I left the winners were divid-
ing the metropolitan churches among them-
selves, and quarrelling over them, and calling
each other all sorts of bad names.—Yours,
etc., Bildad.
From the N.S.W. Gallery:—
The two leaders understand, respect and sympathise
with each other. Both are honest men with oily traitors
amongst their followers; straight-goers, so far as a
party politician can be straight, whose jobs are con-
tinually menaced by bogus extremists. Fuller has
not a particularly penetrating intellect, but he
realises that prohibition is impracticable for any
single Australian State, much less one in the geo-
graphical position of N. S. Wales. And so, dislik-
ing humbug and mendacity, he declines to enthuse
on the question. Not so some of those who are
making sanctimonious efforts to oust him. Their
idea is to get on to the box seat at any price, and
then let the vehicle take care of itself. Lang is
being undermined in the House, at the Trades Hall
and in the gutter press by at least three sections —
the Communists and the sectarians of his party,
Protestant and R.C. In addition he has to suffer the
furtive attacks of pushing young Laborites who don’t
care a hoot for Rome, Derry, Moscow or Macdonell
House, provided they can upset his apple-cart and
pinch the fruit.
When the N. S. Wales Babble Shop re-
opened, the Opposition figurehead produced
the usual desert of words about how much
better the State would be if he and his friends
had the big salaries, finishing:—
We also desire to inform your Excellency that the
Government does not possess the confidence of this
House.
To which the Premier might have replied
My Government doesn’t take the hon. member’s
statements too seriously, and it doesn’t think h<
believes them himself, except, pro jorma and as a
matter of duty. Being aware that no amount of
debate will alter anybody’s opinion or anybody’s
vote, and being desirous not to keep his Excellency
in suspense, I move the closure of the debate so
that a vote may be taken immediately.
That would have been something bright and
new; and unhappily the bright and new
in politics is not welcome—unless it be
another subterranean passage leading to the
pre-selection ballot-box.
Shortly before the Peacock Government
asked Victoria’s opinion of itself and got it,
Holloway, of the Trades Hall Council, made
some statements which should have brought
forth a furious disclaimer, but didn’t. He
said that the venereal clinics w'hich were
opened with such a flourish of trumpets were
falling into decay, starved by a mean
economy, and sacrificed in the struggle to
make Victoria the least-taxed State of the
Commonwealth. Hundreds of patients,
according to Holloway, are being turned away
untreated or only half-cured because the
supply of drugs is only one-third of the
quantity required, and the staff and the
buildings are equally inadequate.
“Cocoanut Anzae” from an outpost :
Woodlark Island is about seven degrees from the
Equator. I was there recently testing a mine for
purpose of report, and found that the total popula-
tion, including three women, was 17. Eight of
these are diggers, whose ages aggregate 509 years,
two being past the three-score-and-ten mark, while
the boy of the family is 54 and saw three years’
active service with the capital-D Diggers. There is
another youngster of 66 who at the age of 61
thought he would do better as a cocoanut cocky in
Papua than as a poultry-farmer at Parramatta, and
so far has not regretted the change. The real baby
of the island is a chap of 27 who has been there
since he was five. I wonder what Leverhulme would
say to this!
Written in sorrow :
In Victoria only a trifle over half the electors
were sufficiently interested to vote, which is more of
a reflection on the candidates than the constituencies.
Of 63,123 on the roll in Boroondara 38,115 were
absentees. Only 49 per cent, of Toorak’s 24,441
did their duty, and 18,000 out of 41,000 stayed
away in Jika Jika, while 5501. of East Melbourne’s
10,938 were bedridden. In the country the worst
instance is that of Evelyn, 5833 voting out of
12,231; but it can be said in excuse that the con-
stituency straggles over some rough roads and in-
cludes a section of the Dividing Range. In Benam-
bra 3003 out of 6700 failed to mark a ticket, and
about the same proportion had other business on
their minds in Benalla, in w'hich the full polling
strength is 7108. In Castlemaine, Dundas and
Daylesford there was a greater show of interest.
The missing in the first two amounted to 28 and 27
per cent., whilst in Daylesford 82 per cent, went to
the poll. The struggle between the two clansmen,
McDonald and McLeod, in w'hich the former carried
the Labor banner and reversed the decision of the
previous election, v r as responsible for the great
roll-up.
“KAMERAD! KAMERAD!
[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
“Things are not what they were in Germany. A
drink of beer now costs two shillings.”
The mark went jazzing gaily down,
But that gave small concern to us ;
Four millions for a fare to town
Was nothing over which to fuss.
Uneonquered yet, we subtly tricked
A world which stood on Ruin’s brink;
But now we know that we are licked—
It costs two bob to buy a drink !
Two million marks we lightly paid
For any tuppence-worth we wished,
When, juggling millions unafraid,
All claims to pay our bills we dished,
And, laughing, shook the loaded dice,
But things are now not what they were:
Two shillings is the awful price
We needs must pay to get a beer!
At last we know our power is dead ;
The pride we gloried in is flown ;
The Vaterland bends low its head
And weeps the splendor it has known.
The worst has happened to our land—
Its tragedy our hearts must sear.
Who now against defeat can stand:
Two shillings is der brice of beer!

The prices of a few lines were a bit jumpy
last year, but “generally speaking,” the
directors report, “trading conditions of the
business ■jyere normal.” Profits disclosed
tire the best in the table, but the figures oi:
other years have to be considered in relation
to the digging out of £BO,OOO of inner re-
serves when the 1923 accounts were pre-
sented. During the period of rising prices
and the subsequent run of erratic markets,
Harper’s did much better than it had pub-
licly admitted. Surpluses in the published
accounts were, indeed, disappointing, but
meanwhile the management had made large
provisions for contingencies, and, everything
having worked out well, the addition of
£BO,OOO to visible reserves last year meant
that average profit-earning had for some
years exceeded £50,000 p.a. Hast year’s har-
vest maintained the average, but these figures,
too, had been affected to an unknown extent
by providing for contingencies. The dis-
closure of contingent reserves which proved
to be profit, and the better returns for the
past 12 months, have so far not affected the
div. rate; the visible lay-by for the year is
larger by a few hundreds than the amount
taken by the ordinaries’ 8 p.c., the Board
having “deemed it wise to adhere to their
policy of recommending moderate divs. while
concurrently building up the co.’s reserves
and strengthening its liquid assets.”
The effect of keeping the div. rate down
is plainly shown by the growth of reserves
in the introductory table—from £7638 to
£189.543 in 10 years. The next table gives
another view:—
1914. 1924.
Liquid assets .. £276,292 £364,948 Inc. £88,656

Since 1914 the only new capital got in was
£30,000 of 7 p.c. prefs. in 1918, increasing
the pref. issue to £150,000. Harper’s began
as a public co. in 1913 in order to seek pref.
capital for an old-established proprietary
business, and in the reconstructed co.
£BO,OOO of the £240,000 of ordinaries were
issued for goodwill. Returns to old pro-
prietors have, therefore, been better than
the declared div. rates, but meanwhile the
large amounts voted into reserves have added
great strength to their holdings. Instead of
one-tliird of their capital being represented
by goodwill, there are now tangible assets
with a book value of £329,543 for £240,000
of scrip. On that basis and with the assist-
ance of £150,000 of comparatively cheap
pref. capital, the earning of the 8 p.c. divs.
should be easy; indeed, if the business con-
tinues to prosper, it should not be long be-
fore higher rates become distributable. The
investing public is now interested in the
ordinaries, restrictions on transfers hav-
ing been lifted 12 months ago. However,
buyers at from 235. to 245. have failed to
locate sellers. At the higher figure 8 p.c.
divs. return only 65 p.c., but on the prospects
of better divs. and the balance-sheet position
—almost 295. of tangible assets per £1
share —that price is warranted. The mar
ket’s trouble seems to be to induce holders
to sell; most of the shares are still held by
the estates of the various Harpers. Three
members of the very capable clan who took
a leading part in the business have died in
the last few years.
The detailed comparisons which follow
show how snug the co.’s position is:—

Cash,'etc 121 22,367 72,665 85,921
Mortgages, deposits and overdraft have all
been swept clear, and the £49,034 of liabili-
ties at March 31 included £20,000 provision
for taxes. On the other side the bank held
£34,510 in deposits and on current account,
and there were also Government securities
for £51,179. The co. is, therefore, quite free
of any outside financing. The backing for
the prefs. is, of course, excellent: to secure
their £150,000 there are tangible assets over
and above liabilities for £519,000-odd—the
book value of properties is at less than cost,
plant and machinery are welt written down,
stocks are reported to have been carefully
and conservatively valued, and book debts
are “thoroughly sound.”

Since 1918, but excepting the 1922 slump
period, this remarkable Sydney cash-drapery
has been showing profits each year, after
settling with prefs., equal to almost one-half
of the money the proprietors had in the busi-
ness when the present co. took over 15 years
ago. Of course, the introductory table does not
show such magnificent harvests. Ordinary
capital at the beginning was £298,500, and
£lOO,OOO of that was issued for goodwill.
Ordinary scrip has since expanded to
£450,000, but apparently only a trifle of
£l5OO has been new cash put in, £lOO,OOO
of reserves having been transferred in 1916
and £50.000 more in 1919. Consequently, on
the allotment to old proprietors at flotation
of the present co., the 15 p.c. divs. are giving
a return of 221 p.c., and so large has been
the lay-by that every £1 of ordinary capital is
now represented by tangible assets with a book
value of 325. sd.—reserves of almost £250,000
have accumulated to help £450,000 ordinary
capital. One reason for the luscious returns
is that much of the money raised to put up
extensive premises was cheap: at flotation
the co. attracted £272.902 of fixed cumulative
prefs. carrying only 6 p.c.
In recent years Mark Foy’s has gone in
more for manufacturing, and plant and equip-
ment now have a written-down book value
of £75,885. Judging by the disclosed profits
the factories have been holding their own
very well in the erratic markets: even during
the period of slump and of heavy stocks the
co. easily earned good divs., which suggested
that stock values had been protected in the
previous good run. Twelve months back the
management was working on an overdraft of
£87,924. but, though stocks have iiot been
materially curtailed, the year’s profits per-
mitted a reduction of the bank account to
£18,120 in March. The only other debts were
£25,079 of trade creditors. The £354,161 of
properties (book value) wa‘s free of mortgage.
The co. is, therefore, very snug; it is prac-
tically independent of outside financing. In-
deed, should profit-earning continue on the
recent scale the management will be embar-
rassed by accumulations of cash if further
expansion of business or more handsome divs.

Since 1911 the surplus of stocks, book debts
and other liquid assets over and above liabili-
ties has grown £298,841; meanwhile £223.196
net has gone into properties and plant. Alto-
gether there has been a visible enlargement
of £522,000. all of which, excepting £l5OO of
new capital, has come out of accumulated
profits. Goodwill was written out of the
accounts in 1915.

This little building society is feeling very
confident about the future. It collected
£lB,(iUti of loan repayments during the past
12 months and lent out £31,379 in new busi-
ness, taking advances to record dimensions.
That “substantial progress,” as the directors
put it, was not the only prominent feature
of the year. Building societies generally
depend on cheap outside money to finance
portion of their own advances, and fixed
deposits are usually the most acceptable form
of borrowing, because interest rates are low
and managements can arrange their business
according to the terms for which the money
is tied to the office. But in recent years it
has not been easy to attract adequate sup-
plies of cheap deposits. During the past 12
months depositors in the Argus withdrew
£7OOO more than they lodged, and to find the
money for the larger advances at April
30 the society was leaning on its bank
for £11,626. As the margin between over-
draft rates and mortgage interest is slender,
the new business cannot be showing much
profit; on the other hand, the larger turnover
of loans should not have added much to office
costs. The Argus will be much better off
when it can attract deposits and pay off the
bank.
Profits were the best ever; they returned
almost 12| p.c. on paid capital, so a good
margin was left after giving 9 p.c. divs. This
rate of profit-earning is possible only because
there are now £42 of reserves to help every
£lOO of paid capital. Other building societies
are paying better divs.. but the Argus is
proud of the fact that its divs. are on “origi-
nal” capital. It struggled through the dark
post-boom days without writing down capital.
There had been heavy losses, and for a long
time the management had a lot of wreckage
on its hands; but shareholders wont with-
out divs. and losses were recouped out of
earnings.
A ten years’ survey is given next:—

Other assets. . 4,033 807 5,366 944
At April 30 outside debt amounted to £38,729
—£7740 more than 12 months back. Capital
and reserves totted up £35,593 after payment
of the year’s div., so the Argus showed assets
with a book value of almost 38s. sd. to pro-
tect every £1 borrowed. Whether the direc-
tors have been wise in expanding the lending
connection under current conditions, and in
depending on a floating debt to do it, is debat-
able. Some of the old hands distrust the
recent inflation of property values and are
restricting their mortgage business; on the
other hand, applications for loans have been
so numerous that the building societies have
been able to select new business with a care-
ful eye on margins and on borrowers’ capacity
to pay instalments regularly.

Garratts, Ltd., is one of the few motor-
agency cos. whose shares are listed on
’Change. It has had an erratic career. Prior
to 1917 practically all profits were kept in
the business, shareholders being rewarded in
that year for their patience with a 25 p.c.
scrip bonus. A run of good divs. followed,
but some of them were earned in the face of
great difficulties, owing to the war restricting
deliveries. Subsequently, when values were
declining, the co. w r as flooded with stocks,
and in the 1922 financial year, after three
price-cuts to help sales, a loss of £46.224
showed up. All reserves and £21,296 of
capital had to be written off to square the
accounts. The co. was fortunate to escape
so lightly: had the depression killed sales,
Garratts, Ltd., must have gone to the wall
owing to its dependence on outside finance.
In the 1923 financial year the co. made a good'
recovery and showed a return of 13£ p.c.
on the written-down capital of £86,182. For
the 12 months to January 31 this year the
net profit worked out at almost 30 p.c., after
providing for contingencies and deprecia-
tion ; but; the directors have voted a further
£BOOO into reserves for contingencies and
taxation. The co. has had a very active
market for Fiat, Overland and Willy..-
Knight cars. Total sales for the past three
years have been: 1922. £109.666; 1923.
£325,160; 1924. £543,543. For the first
three months of the current financial year •
sales soared to £249,774.
The brisk trading since the reconstruction
has been remarkable considering the small
funds at the management’s command. Con-
siderably more than the written-down capital
is tied up in premises and works : hence the
co. has had to borrow heavily and also
juggle skilfully with its flood of bills.
Against £86,182 of paid capital at January
31 last, the co. owed its bankers £87,089,
and there were bills and sundry creditors
for £169,671. While everything is going
well, that plaster of debt is not so serious
”as it looks; on the recent rate of turnover
it is little more than two months’ sales, and
most of the bills are on 90 days’ terms. Such
financing is, however, liable to put the co.
into a very serious position should buyers
not be found for the large stocks on hand
and on order. The co. has badly needed addi-
tional capital, but until the latest accounts
showed that the recovery from post-war
troubles had been fully maintained, Garratts
was not in a position to attract new funds.
However, an effort is now being made to
raise £llO,OOO in 10 p.c. cumulative profs.

of recent years, and shows the backing for
the new issue :

The Oamperdown works have a book value
of not quite £BO,OOO, but a recent valuation
by Richardson and Wrench gives them a
current market value of £105,000 —-that is
apart from plant, of course. Accepting this
valuation for security estimates, on the basis
of the figures in January the co. had a
surplus of £27,051 of stocks, book debts and
cash assets over and above all liabilities
after payment of the final div., and also pre-
mises and plant at present worth approxi-
mately £115,000. On these figures. £llO,OOO
of prefs. would have the backing of about a
quarter-million of assets. So the co. would
have to crash badly before prof, capital would
be lost. With this security, and the offer
of 10 p.c. cumulative divs., the directors
should not have much difficulty in attracting
additional funds. The co. nowadays has
public-accountant Fred Marks as managing*
director.

The A.I.C. is an offshoot of the Vic. Royal
Auto Club: it was formed to handle the
“select” risks of club members at as near
cost as practicable, and it was also intended
that operations should ultimately help the
parent body much as the manufacturers’ insur-
ance enterprise has aided the Vic. Chamber of
Manufactures; the A.I.C. prospectus stated
that a proprietary co. had been formed by
the Auto. Club to buy out members’ indi-
vidual holdings by ballot. The office began
business with “a new and vastly-improved
comprehensive policy” ; it made several con-
cessions not generally provided in policies
without increasing premium rates. In the first
year the A.I.C. wrote 611 policies; during
the past 12 months 1906 comprehensive poli-
cies were issued, apart from renewals. So
far the claims experience has justified the
concessions: losses last year were just one-
third of net premium income. Whether that
will be the normal experience it is difficult
to forecast; as a rule “comprehensive” busi-
ness in all insurance lines tends to show
higher claims rates as the full benefits of
the policies become more widely known, but
in this instance the “moral hazard” —a vital
factor in motor-car claims —is minimised by
the A.l.C.’s association with the Auto. Club.
The directors state that risks are not being
any the less carefully selected while premium
income is bounding ahead. They also say
that the A.I.C. “now controls one-seventh of
the motor-car comprehensive business of Vic-
toria.” It is also operating through an
agency in South Australia, and since Sep-
tember last the Vic. Automobile Chamber of
Commerce has been acting as agent to win
the insurances on new cars sold.
The co. is not overloading itself with risks.

its rate-cutting intentions, the A.I.C. went
abroad for re-insurance. In its first year it
laid off four-fifths of its car-risks; for the
past 12 months gross premiums amounted
to £26,210 (compared with £7329 for 1923),
and £19,369, or almost three-fourths, went
to buy re-insurance. The net premium in-
come was, therefore, £6850. Expenses and
commissions took £7079, which was £229
more than net premium income. Reinsur-
ances, however, are shown gross, and the com-
missions, which, presumably, are only book
entries, are treated separately as income and
are parcelled with portion of interest earnings
(together £5883). Consequently, the actual
cost rate p.c. on net premium income cannot
be computed; it seems to have been approxi-
mately 55 p.c. In its short life the co. has
had two changes of address so as to accom-
modate the staff to handle the growing busi-
ness, and these moves have pushed up costs.
When insurances grow a little larger and re-
newal business is flowing smoothly, the ex-
pense rate should be substantially reduced.
Very few young insurance offices are so well
placed to win business.
The year’s surplus, as shown by the intro-
ductory table, was £3555; but that was prior
to providing for unexpired risks. After in-
creasing that reserve to 40 p.c. of net pre-
mium income, writing off one-fourth of the
balance in the preliminary exes, account, and
providing for depreciation of equipment and
furniture, there was a net profit of £1260.
Only one-half of this profit was required to
pay S p.c. divs. on both prefs. (the co. began
with £2500 8 p.c. cumulative prefs.) and
ordinaries (£5400). Results to date encour-
age the directors to hope that next year’s
report “will include mention of a bonus pay-
able to policy-holders.” Assets at April 30
totted up £16,625: £8704 was in Govern-
ment securities; £2768 in cash and accrued
interest; book debts amounted to £3532 ;
equipment, etc., had a book value of £1381;
and the balance of preliminary exes, was
£240. The little co. lias made a very good
start, but years of experience are necessary
to show (1) how premiums will carry the
additional benefits under to some extent un-
tried policies and (2) what saving can be
effected in expenses.
The latest exciting development in the
search for petroleum is at Beaudesert (Q.).
Early this week the following wire was re-
ceived from the Melbourne headquarters of
the Australian Oil Corporation:—
Dr. Jensen wires new bore down 97ft. on Satur-
day. Oil showing from 77ft. to bottom.
Dr. Jensen has been sinking this well a
few feet away from Dunn’s bore, in which
the reported presence of oil created so much
discussion last year. Though several Queens-
land Government Geologists were not im-
pressed with the locality as a possible oil-
producer, and the Government Analyst was
not enthusiastic about the samples he
handled, Dr. Jensen persisted that the indi-
cations in Dunn’s bore were those of a true
seep. The A.O.C. backed his opinion, and
Jensen recently began work on a new 100 ft.
test-hole to seek confirmatory evidence.
Until the log readings are available and
further information as to the occurrence of
the oil is forthcoming, the value of the new
find must not be over-estimated. For the
present it can be regarded as no more than
highly encouraging to those who are mak-
ing genuine efforts to discover an Australian
oilfield.

Arthur Moore is not finding it easy to
float his Queensland Petroleum, Ltd. Lander’s
delay in producing any tangible results at
Orallo after all the optimistic talk has left
speculators cold. However, Moore is well
known throughout the artesian districts, and
it; is probable that squatting interests will
give his Mitchell enterprise sufficient back-
ing to warrant the commencement of test
drilling. The position of the area in rela-
tion to the Roma gas-field and geological evi-
dence generally certainly justify prospecting
bores. Dr. Jensen thinks the Mitchell
chances quite as good as those at Orallo.
* * * *
Westralia is wondering how Sydney and
Melbourne learned that U.S. oil-geologist
Dr. Clapp had decided against the probable
occurrence of petroleum in certain blocks
in the Kimberley district. Actually at the
time the report was broadcasted Dr.
Clapp’s expedition, whose preparations
for the investigation of the Nor’-west
resembled those for an Indian rajah’s
picnic-hunt, had not got beyond the influ-
ence of the coastal breezes. The camp of
the party was then at the head of Jugurra
Creek, 120 miles from Broome, covering an
area lying between King Sound and the
Indian Ocean, and south as far as La
Grange Bay. Every geologist so far has
reported against the existence of oil there-
abouts ; but what Dr. Clapp had seen thus far
could have no application to the Kimberleys.
By the way, the visitor disregarded all local
advice as to the best means of traversing
the wilderness, and took a vast outfit of
motor-cars and trailers, wireless plant, stores
and sundries galore, and an armory of guns
and automatic pistols. A little way out from
Broome the wireless plant was found useless:
it was continually jambed by the high-power
station at Java. Then the trailers were
found too awkward and sent back. A local
carrier was finally engaged to carry stores
to the first camp, and a good bushman has
taken command. Westralian oil-sharehold-
ers have so far not been told whether the
Sydney crowd who sent Clapp to the West
have signed the option agreement with
Freney’s.

The present boring-site on the Okes-Durack
areas (W.A.) has been condemned by Dr.
Wade. He says that the geological maps
for the area are full of errors, and that for
the Wyndham area, further north, “is not
a map at all.” Country classified as car-
boniferous, Dr. Wade says, belongs to the
upper Cambrian age, and others thought to
be devonian are very much older. He sums
up:—
The bore has penetrated the upper eambrian, and
round no oil. It is hopeless to expect supplies
either in the basalt or in the beds beneath, which
are distinctly metamorphosed. Any oil supply would
be the first thing to vanish during the changes , n
tailed by metamorphosis. I believe ages ago there
may have been an oilfield here, but it has gone,
leaving only traces of its existence [in the form of
bitumen]. This area can be definitely condemned.

Nearly all the deeper shafts on Mt. Isa
Mines (Q.) are now in soft, more or less
leached ore, and a number are quite gossan-
ous. The opinion is growing among the
leaders directing the work on the field that
there is going to be a rich secondary zone at
water-level, and the point now of paramount
interest is: At what depth will this level be
reached? The tightly-bedded veins of galena
and lead carbonate at the surface seemed to
promise little in the way of enrichment, but
this, first-formed opinion has been reversed
by indications in recent underground work.
A couple of shafts to a few hundred feet
are already being discussed with a view to
determining the water level and depth of pri-
mary ore, and what enrichment, if any,
occurs. Chief Geologist Duustan is proceed-
ing to the field next week, and the work
now done should enable him to express an
independent view on this aspect. As the
period for which Government Geologist St.
Smith was loaned to the co. is expiring, he
is being relieved of the work of superintend-
ing development to enable him to prepare
his second report for the Government. Ernest
Vails, formerly of Westralia, has been ap-
pointed g.-m., and Geo. Beard will continue
as mine-manager.

The crowd behind the Isa Proprietary is
out with a new float, Mt. Isa Central, which
is to take over options on eight leases. The
co is in 400.000 shares of ss. each, and
100,000 are offered for subscription. Ven-
dors and promoters take 100,000 fully-paids
and £7500 cash within four months, "and if
the options are exercised £13,330 more cash
is to be paid. The principal lease is the
Spider Ant, a block of 10 acres in the heart
of the field and carrying the southern exten-
sion of the Mt. Isa lode. E. J. J. Rodda
says this formation can be traced on the sur-
face for 10 chains, and where opened up has
shown 12ft. of lode formation. In the Um-
slopogas, 10 acres adjoining the Spider Ant
to the east, there are “several strong lines of
formation,” but prospecting has not got past
the trenching stage. All the other leases
are said to show formations “well worthv of
prospecting.” Mt. Isa Central’s job is to
push ahead with development (it will have
approximately £17,000 after the first pay-
ments to vendors) to ascertain whether the
properties are worth the £45,830 in shares
and cash which is to be paid for them. Sub-
scribers are to receive one fully-paid share
for every 10 subscribed.

“Cyanide”: A couple of mining experts
who have inspected the Mt. Coolon field (Q.)
more than once don’t agree with “C.F.D. 1 ’
(B. 3/7/’24) that there is ample work for
a public battery. “C.F.D.” talks confidently
of 3500 tons blocked out on the Sunbeam
group, but I’ll lay odds that he does not
know the. true average value, or whether a
tenth of it is rich enough to go to the ore-
breakers. Similarly for the 400 tons in the
Horseshoe. Some of this ore has been on
the surface for years, and whether it will
pay to crush is doubtful. But this at least
is certain: much of the ore included in
“C.F.D.’s” estimate will never see a mill.
* * * *
Westralian Mines Inspector Phoenix, who
was. sent to see how S’African mines are
ventilated and how miners’ phthisis is com-
bated, has returned full of ideas and recom-
mendations.. He was very impressed with
what organisation and co-operation have done
for low-grade mining on the Rand. Phoenix
says that, although wages, materials, etc.,
are much higher than in 1914, as a result of
increased efficiency mining and treatment
costs are very little more than in pre-war years.
For the first three months of this ' year
7,000,000 tons of 30s. stuff were treated at
a cost of 20s. per ton. Westralian costs,
despite wider ore bodies, are 15s. per ton
higher than the Rand average. Kalgoorlie
is suffering from “that tired feeling,” and
the importation of a few Rand mining men,
with power to reorganise the industry, is
probably the best that could happen to
Westralian goldmining.
The Lake View and Star-Ivanhoe merger
(W.A.), which is designed to revive the
latter in its declining days, prompts a review
of Ivanhoe’s great record. For 11 years
output averaged over half a million sterling,
and for 25 years more than £400,000. ' The
peak div. years were 1899 and 1900, in each
of which £250,000 was distributed. During
the next 13 years an average of over £200,000
p.a. was paid. The great bulk of this
wealth came from the East lode, which was
for many levels the backbone of the pro-
perty, and in places was of great width. Of
the other ore-bodies, the Middle and New
lodes were the best. Nearly half of the
visible reserves left in the mine are in the
New lode, and most of the balance is in the
East lode workings.
* * * *
The flitting of Golden Butterfly from
Siberia (W.A.) was recorded several weeks
ago, and the “Wild Cat” then predicted that
hard country and dwindling values at depth
would beat other cos. pottering about there.
Paringa has since given up, and Lanarkshire
is expected to follow suit. By sinking a
series of shallow shafts on good values there
was a flutter in scrip, but already Siberia
has become a has-been that never was.
* * * *
Empire Extended, alias Lass o’ Gowrie
East (W.A.), has been raised from the dead
as a result of a far-outback gold find, and
the sale to a crowd of early-birds of 40,000-
odd forfeited shares has put some money
into its previously almost empty till. The
values reported are good, but so far there
has been nothing to justify the claim that
the co. has at last backed a winner.
* * * *
From a man on the spot:—
Brilliant Co. reckons that it has got hold cl
something good at Gnow’s Nest (W.A.). The show
has been opened up to a depth of 285 ft., and all
payable ore has been extracted to that point. As
no work has been done below 285 ft. the Brilliant
is taking it for granted that the reef will be struck
big and good in deeper ground. There is an inflow
of a quarter of a million gallons in the mine daily,
so that sinking and crosscutting will be costly;
£2500, cash and 10,0uO shares, plus developmental
costs, seems a big price to pay for the show.
* * * *
After a year’s silence, except for occasional
postings of yields which made Australian
holders wonder what was wrong with the old
show, Briseis (Tas.) is out with its annual
report explaining some of the difficulties with
which Lindesay Clark has had to contend.
One way and another, Briseis had a poor
run, notwithstanding that, after two years’
wait, while the Ringarooma River was
diverted, Clark was at last able to move into
the North Ringarooma ground, where a tun-
nel went into the lead for a 41b. average. He
is now working on the eastern side of the
bend of the gutter, and gets good drift. On
the western side pug bands feet thick are
an abomination. Between the two faces
boulders are as large and as troublesome as
in a big Ararat lead. So Clark has been
kept going to pick out the good patches of
drift. His bottom is now 150 ft. below the
Ringarooma’s old river-bed, and a lot of extra
water-power is required for elevator work.
From this troublesome gutter he sluiced
397,000 cubic yards for 252 i tons last year.
From a four months’ spin on 120 200 yards in
1922 he cleaned up 91 tons. With the metal
market good, last year’s clean-up gave a
profit of £18,896. This is the first credit for
many a long day, and it has reduced the 1922
debit from £33,526 to £14,628. Cash assets
have been improved, and stand at £33,827
against £12,342 a year ago, so divs. should
not be far off if the drift yields better and
the tin market holds up.
* * * *
Christmas Gift, Cootamundra (N.S.W.),
continues to maintain a better appearance.
Working one shift, for June the battery put
through 201 tons for 1930 z. across the plates.
The winze in Baulderson’s lode contributed
101 tons, which gave 1411 oz. The lode is
too flat to continue the winze, but stoping
is proceeding to the north-west, where two to
four feet of good ore is showing. The Federal
lode below 200 ft. weighed in with 100 tons
for 51|oz. This make is showing a “fair
percentage of ore of good values.” varying
from two to six feet wide, and quality is im-
proving as work goes east.
* * * *
“Old Tin”: Certainly, as “Allendale” (B.
3/7/’24) says, alluvial shows when in the
shallow ground did not want much working
capital; but when the leads deepened and
the pumps had to be kept going, £50,000 was
about the average cost of opening up a mine.
Madame Berry West is not so far down the
gutter, and it ate up a lot more than that
sum. Spring Hill Leads did ditto, and so
did its neighbors. The lower Chalks mine
went the same financial way until it wound
up with the costly Duke and Main Lead
Consols. Rutherglen costs were much the
same. Not having the figures by me of
the Madame Ristori I cannot contradict
“Allendale” as to the called-up capital which
permitted it to dig out £430,918 of gold;
but it is clear that “Allendale” should belong
to the Ad. Men’s Club when he links up the
new Ristori with that old-timer. Madame
Berry West, like the Madame Berry, had
plenty of potholes, but it did not pay, while
Madame Berry did. More than similarity
of names is needed to produce divs.

Asam Kumbang (F.M.S.) continues its
good run. For June 104,000 c. yd. were
treated for 79 tons tin, giving an average
of 1.71 b. per yd. The dredge recovered 3211 b.
tin every working hour. Proceeds, with
oxide averaging £123, totalled £9720 for a
working cost of £2005. Meanwhile Ulu Yam,
working fib. ground, won £4636 of tin on
an expenditure of £lBl5, and old Kampong
Kamunting, in material going only slightly
more than earned £5912 at a working
cost of £2990.

it was, tli£ lady explained: “I am writing to

Will you please tell me?” After the question

“Alex. Val”: Whiskers climbed into a
first-class carriage of the mailtrain and
seated himself opposite a couple of modern
flappers who were enjoying a smoke. “I
hope you don’t mind,” one of the sweet-
young things said. “Not a bit, miss,” re-
plied Whiskers; “I’m used to it. I come
from the Gulf, and all the blacks smoke up

“S.T.S.” : King George, receiving the Aus-
tralian Boy Scouts at Buckingham Palace,
reminded them of his visit to Australia 43
years ago, “when I was about your size.” A
high-spirited middy at that time, he showed
a curious contrast both to his own later
gravity and to that of his elder brother,
Prince Edward, who died 10 years after-
wards. As it chances I have just turned
up among the papers of my father, who was
Mayor of Adelaide at the time of that 1881
visit, a half-sheet with “Albert Victor” and
“George” scribbled on it a dozen times —the
former being the name by which Edward was
always known till he grew up. Evidently
the two boys had been trying their hands with
a pen before signing something of import-
ance. As a souvenir it seems unique. Royal
autographs are not usually provided in bulk.
“Sturt” : Governor Bridges of S.A., at the
annual dinner of the Limbless Soldiers’
Association in Adelaide, told the mutilated
men to “keep on kicking,” and quoted Tom
Hood’s old rhyme of Ben Battle: “But a
cannon-ball took off his legs, so he laid down
his arms.” His Ex. is one of the very few
who could decently do this kind of joking in
that company, for he lost his own leg in the
war, and does so well with a substitute that
he still plays golf. He also cited the case of
a friend whose war service ran thus: (1)
lost an eye; (2) returned and lost an arm;
(3) returned again, was shot in the neck,
and won the V.C.; (4) returned once more
and was shot in both legs—ll wounds in all;
(5) went as head of the military mission
to Poland. “And he still hopes to win the
Grand National Steeple on his own horse.”

“Kyver” : Here is my entry in the queer
war-casualties competition. Portions of
Lone Pine were unpleasantly close to Abdul’s
front line, with the result that both his and
our engineers were continually sapping, lay-
ing mines and blowing up trenches. Very
often the rival engineers broke into each
other’s saps, and made underground connec-
tions between the two front lines. We
always blocked these holes with sandbags,
leaving a steel-plated loop-hole in each block-
ade. A rifle was then poked through the
loop-hole, and the sentries were instructed
to shoot immediately they heard sounds.
One September night, soon after relieving a
mate, a sentry heard a movement on the
opposite side of the barrier, and pulled the
trigger. The rtfie kicked, and smashed liis
jaw. On being examined the barrel was
found to be blocked with earth. A light-
footed and -fingered Turk had gamely played
the trick.
“Anzac Still,” Imperial War Graves Com-
mission, Dardanelles: —
“Billy Cann” mentions and queries (B. 13/3/’24)
a statement that Prime Minister Bruce while on
Gallipoli rode from Anzac to
Chanak on a waler, I’m sorry to
be so long in clearing the matter
up, but after Gyppo and Turkish
P.O. officials have finished with
The Bulletin, it takes about
seven weeks for it to reach the
Dardanelles. If “Billy Cann” will
look at his map he will see that
Anzac to Chanak is a bit im-
probable even for a waler, owing
to the Dardanelles. Actually Bruce
rode from Kelia Liman to Anzac
on a waler which once belonged
to the 7th A.L.H., and previously,
as his brand shows, to the 6th
A.L.H. The 7th A.L.H. were
garrisoning the Peninsular side of
the Dardanelles in December, 1918,
and January, 1919. The graves
in Chanak Cemetery are evidence
of this, and so is Bill the waler.
It was Paddy Ryan who did
Hughes, of the Australian Engi-
neers, a good turn when he
swapped Bill for Hughes’s Tommy
mount. Bill is still going strong.
Princes, Prime Ministers and Ad-
mirals have all ridden him, and he
knows Anzac better than many a
Digger. He has been at every
25th April Commemoration ser-
vice held here. We will back him
to rob any Turkish cocky’s melon-
patch and give the local pound -
keeper the slip every time.
“Gunnedah”: Sydney’s annual carnival of
St. Jumbuck was set going last week by the
State Governor, and attended by many sun-
burnt gentlemen, traders in dips and shear-
ing machines, John Macarthur, Esq., of the
Cow Pastures, Captain Waterhouse, R.N.,
and the Rev. Samuel Marsden. It was a
good show, quite as exciting as a Methodist
Conference, and well stocked with blue-
blooded representatives of the foolish breed
of animals which Messrs. Macarthur, Water-
house and Marsden introduced to these
shores. Unfortunately I could obtain no
expression of opinion regarding the quality
of the exhibits from these worthies. Mr.
Macarthur was too much occupied in de-
nouncing Admiral Bligh, and boastfully re-
counting his part in the ejection of that
profane sailorman; Captain Waterhouse
spent the days belittling the use of steam
at sea, and Sam Marsden would talk of
nothing but the mission to Maoriland. So I
left them and wandered gloomily through
the pens, to wonder what this fair land had
done, in the unrecorded ages of its exist-

ence, that it should be given over to the
most stupid, cowardly and uninspiring of
God’s creatures. It cannot, of course, be
doubted that to the sheep we owe nearly
everything material and moral we possess
—but it is not a cheering thought. Those
good Australians, the kangaroo and the
dingo, who have been mercilessly persecuted
and expatriated on their behalf, do possess
some engaging qualities: these other over-
dressed quadrupeds have neither intelligence,
fidelity, morality, good manners nor orna-
mental qualities. They have enriched
and ruined many, but no man has
ever been moved by genuine affection for
these silly creatures who can only overeat
themselves and wear warm overcoats. As
legs of mutton, lamb and mint-sauce, pairs
of trousers and blankets they are tolerable
and ever admirable. As their plain selves
they are abominable. I don’t wonder that
Macarthur, Waterhouse and Marsden
wouldn’t discuss them.

“M.” : Touching the late Edmund Fisher’s
writing-desk, it was Judge Redmond Barry,
not Stawell, who leant over it 44 years ago
to hand Ned Kelly his death-warrant, thereby
bringing much obloquy upon himself from
the underworld of the period. The writer
retains a vivid recollection of a monster
procession which invaded Government House
with a demand for Ned’s reprieve, on the
ground that he had been driven to crime by
the persecution of the police. They got a
cold reception; and as there was no Labor
party then in existence to take up Kelly’s
cause, the gallows duly claimed its victim.
Barry himself died about a week later, and
in his sudden demise many people professed
to find evidence that the Divine wrath had
been kindled against the man who had be-
stowed the martyr’s crown on the last of the
big bushrangers.

“Nimshi”: Pars about a jilt’s legal right
to retain engagement presents remind me
that a probationer nurse in a Queensland
country hospital, where I was a patient,
showed me seven engagement-rings and a
varied assortment of trinkets garnered from
love-sick swains during a flirtatious career.
Being a well-educated and very presentable
damsel, she had evidently found suitors
plentiful. She told me, without making any
bones about it. that she was the despair of
a respectable family—papa bred jumbucks—
and was in receipt of a small allowance on
the understanding that the same would lapse
should she duck under the homestead fence.
She eked out the pittance by probationing
(she’d been at that stage 10 years!). As for
returning the rings, etc., she pooh-poohed
the suggestion. These were the trophies of
her bow and spear, and she gloried in them!
“Country Ped”: When I went to school
the old alphabetical method of teaching
reading was in vogue. It had its drawbacks,
but reading was better than it is now. Spell-
ing certainly was. Since I have been a
teacher I have employed the phonic method,
and as the years go on I am more and more
convinced that
reading is not
advancing, and that
spelling is getting
worse. It is only
within the last 10
years that business
men have begun to
loudly complain of
the very poor know-
ledge of spelling
exhibited by clerks
and typistes. Not
having been taught
anything about
letters qua letters,
eighth-grade child-
ren are found writ-
ing “witch” for
“w hie li” and
“whith” for “with.”
It looks terrible, I
know, but what
difference, notable
by children, not
elocutionists, is
there in the pro-
nunciation of each
pair of words? An-
other curious re-
sult of the phonic
method I have
noted in recent
years: upper-grade
children have great
difficulty in under-
standing the lay-
out of a dictionary.
Having no clear
conception of the
alphabet, they are
absolutely at fault
when looking for a
word, turning over
the leaves in a
blind endeavor to
strike the right
place. It seems we
will have to go back on our tracks.
“G.8.L.” on Jutland as a gunnery-test:—
“C.H.R.’s” conclusions upon British and German
naval gunnery (B. 26/6/’24) are only partly borne
out by the official figures for the Battle of Jutland,
as given by the late Sir Julian Corbett in “Naval
Operations,” Vol 111. “C.H.R.” says, comparing
the methods by which each nation controlled its
firing, that “a British ship would be hit by four or
five shells all at the same time, say every 20
minutes, whereas the German ship would be hit
by one or two shells, but at more frequent inter-
vals.” The Jutland statistics show that 14 British
ships were sunk as against 11 German; that British
total casualties numbered 6784 as against 3039 ;
and that British ships registered a total of 158 hits
on German ships compared with the latter’s 123 on
British vessels. “C.H.R.’s” contention that the
British system of fire produces most hits was thus
confirmed, but his argument that “the material
damage might be much the same” is demolished by
the fact that, although German gunners registered
35 hits less than the British, they sank three ships
more and caused over twice as many casualties. The
German navy may have become disinclined for a
further trial of strength as a result of this fight,
but the fact remains that it gave more than it
received in the one great naval battle of the war.

A DISTINCTION.
[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
“It would be idle to pretend that many people
did not make munificent donations for the purpose
of obtaining a title, but a contract for the purchase
of such a thing would be tainted and illegal.” —An
English Judge last week.
If you’re affluent and ambitious of a title,
Just slosh your cash judiciously about;
If you give enough, you’ll get it in requital,
There isn’t any reasonable doubt.
But you’ll make a bloomer and you’ll be a goner
And your simple soul is like to get a jar
If you think that you can purchase such an “honor,”
Like a fellow buys a drink across the bar.
That would constitute a most erroneous notion,
An idea to be condemned in terms severe
In that parent isle of ours across the ocean —
Aye, or here.
If you think the royal fount, distinctions spraying,
Is a sort of penny-in-the-slot machine
Whence you pull your title out by simply paying,
Well—you ought to be in moral quarantine !
When you’ve subsidised such meritorious causes
As to men of public spirit make appeal,
Sit back and wait till general applause is
Forthcoming for your philanthropic zeal.
Don’t expect to have a contract, signed and solid,
That your quid pro quo instanter they will sling ;
That indeed would be a sordid and a squalid
Sort of thing.
You may count if you pursue your aim intently
On your recompense for service to the State,
But you want to chase it tactfully and gently,
Not the way a bull goes charging at a gate.
You must zigzag, as it were, towards your quarry,
Like a turkey-shooter on his tortuous trail,
For ’twould make no end of patriots sad and sorry
To admit (or think) that titles are For Sale.
Still, life is largely humbug and flapdoodle,
And if you’ll only pull the strings aright
And are game to spring the necessary boodle
You may yet, although reputedly a noodle,
Rise a knight.

“Schiiorrer”: Jews really have an Esper-
anto of their oavll ill Yiddish. Avhich more
than half of the race not only understand
blit use, Yiddish is merely a base German
which lacks any grammar or regular rules;
amongst the Jews in America, who derive
front all parts of Europe, it is not only the
common language, but a number of news-
papers are published in it, and within the
last half-century a very extensive Yiddish
literature has sprung up. Contrary to a
common impression, Yiddish has no associa-
tion with Hebrew, which, as a matter of
fact, is known by comparatively few Jews,
except in Small patches for religious pur-
poses, The East End of London is the only
plaGe In the British Empire where Yiddish
is . COtnmonly spoken, and tile Chosen who
pride themselves Upon being “British Jews”
are inclined to look down on it.

“Silas Snell’s” balcony scene:—
Things happened rapidly at our boarding-house the
other evening, when Peter Chester asserted himseii.
The trouble arose over a marked preference Mrs.
Chester had been showing for a bachelor
boarder named William Green. Mrs.
Chester smiled on AVilliam, and cast in-
sinuating glances at him, and AVilliam,
being a susceptible man, Chanced the
ducks and responded in kind. Meanwhile
Chester remained in the background
glowering horribly. Green should have
taken warning from that glower; but
Mrs. Chester was young and handsome,
and William’s vanity was inflamed; so
he continued to offer chivalrous atten-
tions, and Chester intensified his scowl
and brooded in the middle distance,
though drawing visibly closer. One night
last week the storm broke. Chester
found Airs. Chester and Mr. Green out
on the balcony in close communion. He
offered no remarks, invited no explana-
tions, but waded in. He led with his
right and crossed with his left, and botli
blows connected. Green went over back-
wards, taking his chair Avith him, and
Chester took advantage of his prostrate
position and trampled on him. Then he
pulled his adversary up and knocked him
down again, and fell upon him. Finally
he rolled him up and down the balcony
till he was a collapsed and helpless object.
Then Chester arose and, still without
apology or comment, departed for his room.
There was now a ring of interested lodgers
around the recumbent AVilliam. Some-
body raised his head and Mrs. Chester addressed him
in ecstatic tones. “Oh!” she cried, “it’s just splen-
did to make Peter jealous. He’s just lovely when
he’s jealous. I love to make, him jealous— don’t you?”

“Tarwoona” : I was in charge of one firing
party during the war and present at another,
besides having at least five others described
to me. In none of these cases was a revolver
used; only once Avas it referred to. That
was when I was in charge of the proceedings
and had explained to a firing party of 14 that
the kindest thing they could do for the con-
demned man was to aim straight. From
all appearances every bullet went home —
the piece of paper pinned over the heart was
torn to shreds. It was when the A.P.M.
asked the doctor to pronounce life extinct
that the trouble began. The unhappy M.O.
had turned grey-green and couldn't arti-
culate a word. Tne A.P.M., after repeating
the question several times, and getting no
answer, turned to me and said “I’m afraid
you will have to do your duty.” (I after-
Avards found out that it was his, the A.P.M. s,
duty, anyAvay.) But when the doctor saw me
unbutton my holster, his tongue was loosened.
He choked out: "Of course he is dead,”
and turned round to be violently sick. There
are other popular items about firing parties
which are quite erroneous, such as that which

corded, he was obliged to replace the broken

siles hurled overnight by young hoodlums.
The stress that was laid upon his soul may
be gauged from this quaintly-worded adver-
tisement Avhich appeared over his signature:

“Norbell”: In my matutinal wanderings
around the Western "Suburbs of Sydney with
our faithful Carlo, the monotony of “Tlielma-

names of desirable 30-bob-a-week homes, is
occasionally broken by an aberrant title like
“Niagara Falls” or “Y Worry.” But to my

covered the real pick of the basket, the neo-

A SONG OF SUBURBS AND SAFE CRIME.
[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
“Alderman Payne, at a meeting of the Randwick
(.Sydney) Council, drew attention to the shortage of
police protection. He stated that there was an average
of a burglary a night in the district. It was said that
one policeman at night controlled the area from
Maroubra to Centennial Park.”
Beneath the immutable stars
Is a home that’s the pride of Bondi:
Here Brown and his several cars
And his wife and his progeny lie,
Protected by shutters and bars
From the gaze of the rude passer-by.
.Now hark to the cries of despair
That proceed from the mansion of Brow n !
A burglar is working in there ;
Its defences he’s calmly torn down ;
The shutters swing wide to the air,
And no bars on the neighborhood frown.
The jewels of poor Mrs. 8.,
Her silverplate, well-kept and bright—
With these he is soon seen to flee
In a car that was Brown’s chief delight;
And none grabs the masked refugee
As he scorches off into the night.
In Coogee, where surfers take tea,
In Clovelly and Kensington snug
Where Waverley dips to the sea
And in Randwick, prime haunt of the mug,
The burglar makes equally free,
And the sneak-thief, garrotter and thug.
Maroubra, however, contains
On the night we are dealing with now
A constable furnished with brains,
likewise brawn: his intelligent brow
Contracts, and his sharp ears he strains
At the tiniest hint of a row.
Around that still suburb he tramps
While far Coogee re-echoes with yells,
As hold-ups and safe-blowing ramps
Make its mansions and cottages hells;
And thieves explore Botany’s camps
And Little Bay’s hillsides and dells.
This laborer well earns his hire,
But to Boyle Roche’s bird’s wondrous ways
He clearly can never aspire.
No cop on ten diff’rent beats strays
All at once, howso great his desire.
Though he’s monarch of all he surveys,
Yet he can’t survey more than a shire.

John Allan had to fight for the leadership
of the Vic. Parliamentary Cocky party, but
he won. The majority of the 13 in the
Assembly and the half-dozen in the Council
have a good conceit of themselves, and are
ready to take anything from the Premier-
ship to a seat on the Railway Committee.
The venerable Downward, who has had only
six months of office in 30 years* was made
deputy-leader, and Mackrell secretary. Labor
didn’t have any contests. Prendergast
(leader), Billson (deputy-leader), Lemmon
(sec.) and Jewell (Whip) were all re-in-
stalled, with the fervent hope that they
would get better jobs when the Peacock Gov-
ernment was fired from the Treasury benches.
W. G. Layton is Sydney’s eighth Town
Clerk. The first was Charles Henry Cham-
bers. a solicitor, whose daughter Lucy was
a famed vocalist in her day. Chambers was
selected from five candidates, all lawyers, in
November, 1842. and resigned in July, ‘43.
He was followed by John Rae, a Scotch
FRZNC B.S. FALICINER, president Sheep-
breeders’ Association of N.S.W., whose
annual show has been held in Sydney
during the week.
M.A., who held office until 1853, when the
City Council was abolished; three Commis-
sioners being appointed—Rae was one. In
1857, when the Council was restored, he
became secretary and accountant in the Rail-
way Department; and four years later was
made Under-Sec. for Public Works and
Commissioner for Railways. He died 24
years ago, aged 87. The new City Council,
with George Thornton as Mayor, elected
Charles H. Woolcott, who had been in the
service of the city since the first ’forties, and
he" held the Town Clerkship for the record
stretch of 30 years. Next came Henry J.
Daniels (1887-98), then John R. Palmer
held the job for 14 months, after which R.
McC. Anderson had it for 15 months, and
was succeeded by T. H. Nesbitt in 1901.
Woolcott’s salary was £440; Layton’s is
£2lOO.
Judges are a long-lived race. The Ma
State is now paying pensions to five of them
—Rogers (82), Fitzhardinge and Heydon
(78), Sly (76) and Backhouse (74) ; and
Hamilton (70) will shortly be added to the
list.
Some century-old legal history has been
dug up by the well-versed Aubrey Halloran
for the Australian Historical Society. In
1818 .the practising solicitors of Sydney were
Thomas Wylde, T. S. Amos, James Norton,
W. H. Moore and Frederick Garling, the
last two being Crown Solicitors. George
Allen, who founded the firm which became
Allen and Allen and is now Allen, Allen and
Hemsley, was trained in the office of Fred-
erick Garling. James Norton was the
founder of Norton, Smith and Co.; he
bought the practice of W. 11. Moore for an
annuity of £lOOO, which went regularly to
England, whither Moore retired, for many
years. Charles Windeyer and John Stephen,
founders of two other notable legal families,
came very soon after these.
Councillor Coulson, who has just retired
from the Collingwood (Vic.) Council after
a quarter-century’s
service, was run-
ning a store at
Everton in the
’seventies, and was
stuck up by the
Kelly gang, then
on the way to hole,
up the Jerilderie
bank. Coulson
didn't like the ex-
perience, and had
t h e satisfaction
later of being pre-
sent when Ned was
captured.
CHARLES
MISCAMBLE,
third Vic. Rail-
way Commis-
sioner, who takes
over the sole
control of the Tas-
manian railways
at the end of
the month.
Passed out at Woollahra, Sydney, W. F.
Brennan, one. of the oldest solicitors in the
State. He was the inventor of the Brennan
break-of-gauge switch, and had been for years
hammering at Australian Railway Commis-
sioners to get them to adopt it, but without
success. The loss of a son and a daughter
during the war was a blow from which the
veteran never recovered.
Big, smiling .John Stinson, who came off
a farm at Blayney (N.S.W.) to study law
and for 20-odd years has been part of the
Pigott and Stinson firm, died last week.
There have been few law offices with more
politics in them; Pigott was an old Parlia-
mentarian, and Stinson was for years presi-
dent of the National Assoc. Yet he never
stood for Parliament himself. With a clear
head and a good Scots heart lie had of late
years done fine work. as : chairman. of Sydney
Hospital.
Col. Snowden, who shortly goes to London
to relieve A. H. Aslibolt as the Speck’s
Agent-General, said the other day that he
refused to believe mining in Tas. was down
and out. It recalls the almost forgotten
story as to how Snowden pdre founded the
family fortune. According to the ancient yarn,
when he had a humble job with a city brok-
ing firm, Snowden, sen., was given the free-
dom of an urgent telegram adumbrating a
phenomenal rise in Mt. Bischoff shares. The
quiet youth, hitherto unsuspected of specula-
tive ginger, somehow raised the means to
plunge on the share market, and scooped
thousands in a night. Solid investments in
drapery and freeholds led to a fine house
on a hill, aldermanic honors and a family
“sociable” which, with its pair of high-
stepping and well-caparisoned horses, was
for many years the most conspicuous equip-
age in Hobart.
Sister Mary Alphonsus Warded, of the
Monte St. Angelo Convent of Mercy at
North Sydney, who died recently, had been
in the Order for 36 years, and for the greater
part of that time had been Reverend Mother
of various branch houses, being looked upon
as an authority on conventual management.
Edward AVardell. her father, was a man well
known in ecclesiastical circles, but is best
remembered as the designer of the plans for
St. Mary’s Cathedral, Sydney, and St. Pat-
rick’s Cathedral, Melbourne.
J. J. Simons, who founded the Young
Australia League before he had a vote, is
planning to take 100 boy-tourists to Europe
next year, and has visited Sydney to arrange
with the N. S. Wales applicants. Primin-
ister Bruce has given the project his bless-
ing, and Ramsay Macdonald has sent word
that he will be glad to see the travellers at
No. 10 Downing-street if he is still there
when they reach Cockaigne. Simons was
born at Clare (S.A.), and has lived most of
his life at Perth, but Australia is one and
indivisible as far as he is concerned. He is
idolised by his Leaguers, 500 of whom fought
on the battlefields which the tourists will
visit, and the worst that has ever been said
about him is that he was in Parliament for
12 months.
“The Deacon”: Sydney’s veteran solici-
tor, William Francis Brennan, who will
pursue Costs no more, was educated at Lynd-
liurst College, and must have been very nearly
tho last survivor of that first effort to estab-
lish an R.C. clerical and lay seminary in
Australia. It was an extension, first of all,
from Woolloomooloo, where Archbishop
Polding transformed his own residence into
a college, beginning with four students. That
was in 1835. In 1838 a temporary building
in the cathedral grounds was occupied, and
finally the Lyndhurst site was secured, and
the college that was to educate so many
prominent public men of N.S.W. was opened
in 1852. It flourished for some years, but
gradually faded, and was finally closed down
by Archbishop Vaughan.
“Rienzi”: Barrister Phil Jacobs, who
failed to capture Greenwood's stronghold,
Boroondara, in the Vic. elections, is a
County Court man with the reprehensible
gift of faithfully mimicking his fellow law-
yers. He could get a vaudeville engagement
on the strength ot his impersonation of the
late C. J. Madden delivering one of his lec-
tures from the bench, and there are rumors
of a convulsing imitation of his esteemed
brother-in-law, Isaac A. Isaacs, of the High
Court. I am not sure whether Jacobs lias
ever appeared in public, but somebody like
him took part in an amateur Sunday-’after-
noon concert at Pentridge gaol a while back,
and burlesqued some of the Judges whom the
audience knew only too well. The turn
was the hit of the bill, and a couple of old
hands risked boiling oil with their vociferous
demands for an encore.
George Pelham Shipp, the Sydney Uni.
graduate who won the Cooper Travelling
Scholarship in 1922, has improved on that
achievement. The Cooper scholarship was
only for two years, which he spent at Cam-
bridge ; but after winning a first-class in
the Classical Tripos with special distinction,
he. has been given a grant from the Cam-
bridge University Scholarship Funds to
enable him to put in another year on re-
search work.
Mrs. Kate Dwyer is due to get over the
strange feeling of being off the N. S. Wales
A.L.P. executive, and it is likely that her
sister Annie Golding wall join her shortly.
The latter is fourth on the list of “alter-
native members” elected by the last Labor
Conference, the whole quartet being strong
supporters of the industrial section. Can-
didates for Parliament have to relinquish
their executive seats, and on this account the
passing out of J. J. Lynch, P. V. Stokes and
I). McLelland is certain. The Golding sis-
ters, including another, Belle, made history
when the womanhood suffrage movement was
on. They were recognised leaders in the mili-
tant section which, objecting to her quiet
methods, at one time tried to take the reins
from Rose Scott, a move which culminated
in a meeting at which some hapless men
who were interested in the cause had um-
brellas broken over their heads, and one poor
chap was stabbed with a hatpin.
Michael Cole,, recently dead at Ballarat,
aged 82, accompanied his father when the
latter drove the injured Peter Lalor to Gee-
long in a dray after the Eureka Stockade
light. As a price had been placed on Lalor’s
head, they had to travel by night and hide
by day.
By going to the Speck as sole Railway
Commissioner, Charles Miscamble will in-
crease his income by slightly over £6OO a
year. At present he draws £1750 as third
Vic. Commissioner. In Tas. he will get
£2OOO, but he is also entitled to a pension
of approximately £360 a year from Vic. in
respect of his 36 years’ service (1883-1919)
before he became one of the trinity of heads.
The Smiths who so much ran S.A. about
20 years ago that The Bulletin suggested
“Smith Australia” as an alternative name
for the State have mostly moved on. One
of the last of the group now goes out of office
—R. W. Smith, Commissioner of Taxes. He
entered the service half a century ago and was
in the Taxation Department from its start
in 1885. E. H. Cornish takes the post,
combining with it his former job of head of
the Stamp Duty Office.
“Ringer”: “T.P.” (B. 12/6/’24) refers
to Wing-Commander Goble being turned
down in 1914 for defective eyesight. Re-
minds me that at Enoggera (Q.) “Big Jim”
Hawkins, a well-known western hors^-
breaker, was being put through the riding
test for the Light Horse. While he was
cantering around his hat blew off, and he
wheeled and picked it up without drawing
rein. The Majah in charge immediately re-
jected him—they didn’t want circus riders.
“Big Jim” took no more chances; he went
away in the infantry.
T. If. NESBITT, who relinquished office as
Town Clerk of Sydney at the end of
June.
The versatile Bill Plain is trying to secure
election to the Senate by a vote of Vic. Par-
liament to fill the vacancy caused by Barker's
death. Pie was formerly Labor member for
Geelong in the Vic. Assembly and was in
the short-lived Elmslie Government as Minis-
ter for Lands. Leaving the Labor fold lie
lost the Senate seat which he next held; and
now he. isn’t a strong favorite with many
Nationalists who count. He is head of the
Nat. Fed., and, whatever the reason (short-
age of cash or what), it has had nothing
but disasters lately. A. W. H. White, a
last-century Conservative member of the
Assembly and now a Cocky, is the nominee
of the Country party, and Labor is running
a man. If there is, preferential voting,
Labor’s No. 2’s may give the seat to White.
“Jimmy Possum” : Went west at Bunda-
berg (Q.),-aged 65, James Conway Langdon,
who had been in charge of several important
cattle stations in Bananaland before a stroke
drove him to a less strenuous life in Bris-
bane a couple of years ago. In 1906, when
in charge of Taunton, on the coast between
Bundaberg and Gladstone, Langdon with
three of his men put up the still-unbroken
record of branding, cutting, ear-marking, de-
horning, bangtailing and numbering 87 calves
in 60 minutes. The game old boy was
stone blind at the end, which came suddenly.
“Naklioda”: J. T. Beckett and Prof. Wood
Jones met in the Centre of Australia lately;
Beckett was there looking unsuccessfully for
Griffith Taylor’s desert spaces; Wood Jones
was at his old game of measuring human
eraniums and studying hoppers, and crawlers.
His first visit, to Australia was made 20
years ago, when he was doctor on one of the
Eastern Extension co.’s cable-repairing
steamers which had underwater business in
Botany Bay. He used this appointment as
a means to get to Cocos Island, where he
studied coral and the history of the famous
Ross family, owners of the group, about
whom he Avrote a fascinating book. Later
he found a job which took him to the middle
of Africa, and that produced a valuable work
too —mostly about skulls. His present pro-
fessorship in the Adelaide ’Varsity is only
a smoke-screen to hide his latest work on
Australia’s queer fauna.
“Ex-Dig.”,: Captain “Gipsy” Smith,
due in Sydney this month, is a religi-
ous enthusiast of a type not uncommon
in the British regular army. But I
met only one such evangelically-inclined
officer in the A.I.F. —a lieutenant whose
passion for religious meetings and praters
made the padre look like a careless
worldling. He was not as popular as he
might have been with the bulk of the men
because of his frequent intercession on behalf
of lead-swingers, who would gain his sym-
pathy by hypocritical profession of religion ;
but three hard cases who had gone a.Av.l. had
reason to be thankful to him. He prayed
with them while they were on their way back
to camp to pay the price of their holiday ;
and it was his subsequent guarantee that they
had found grace and would walk the straight
path in future that enabled them, to escape
a penalty. He died in action, and was found
with his Bible in his hand : he had evidently
been reading it whilst lying mortally
wounded.
Though a distinguished educationist, that
well-known Vincentian, Fr. J. Slattery, is
likely to be best remembered as a scientist.
A pioneer in wireless, to him belongs the
credit of despatching the first message in
Australia—from Bathurst to the neighbor-
ing village of Kelso, a distance of about two
miles.
FIDDLER’S GREEN.
[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
I came one dusk to Fiddler’s Green,
Set in the blue that lay between
The hazy earth and sunset sky,
Beyond the reach of human eye.
In that sweet place ’twas always day.
The pipers piped that we might play.
They flung me smiles, and called me queen,
For I met my love in Fiddler’s Green.
From flowery fields I wandered back,
But now I cannot find the track
That leads past purple hill and plain
Unto that land of joy again.
“Oh tell me, little rosy child,
With dancing feet and hair flung wild,
Which is the way your feet have been--
Which is the way to Fiddler’s Green V”
“My little feet grow weary soon,
And far from morning is the noon ;
1 may not find till 1 am old
The path that loops that world of gold!’’
“Oh, aged man with locks of snow
And stumbling steps that are so slow,
Vour eyes have viewed the distant scene—
Oh, tell me where is Fiddler’s Green!"
“My sight is dim, and all the way
Is darker than a winter's day.
Unto that land your lips have sung
Alone may pass the joyous young!”
Oh, who can lead me back once more?
My heart with longing lieth sore.
“Only across death’s dart; demesne
You’ll come again to Fiddler’s Green!”
victoria.

“Billy the Bird”: One promised feature
of the Millennium is to -be seen daily in Samoa;
here the cat lies down with the chicken and the dog
contemptuously passes by. Sot isolated eases, mind;
so far as my four years’ observations go, the rule is
unbroken. Nor is it due to lack of sporting in-
stinct ; the Samoan dog is a canine Flock Keys at
“mixing-it,” but he fights only his own species, and
puss is welcome to stay and see the tussle. Amidst
dozens of dogs and cats, the hens lead their progeny
abroad and return at night with full tallies. But
other incidentals of the Millennium are lacking; our
hens and plump cockerels disappear, inexplicably and
soundlessly. I questioned a Samoan j'oung man
about this. “Saina setella,” he said promptly
(Chinamen steal them). But when I asked Ah
Fat his dictum was: “Samoan he come stealem!”
* * * *
“Gill Guy”: Text-books notwithstanding,
here are some particulars re botfly w r hich sit as
close to the truth as the feathers on a duck's breast.
The ’fly is a family group of three distinct varieties
—one attacks the horse, one cattle and the other
sheep. Differing from “Nugget” (B. 12/6/’24), I
have seen the eggs adhering to the hairs on horses’
chests, shoulders and forelegs, and under the jaws
is a specially favored place. These eggs hatch on
the hairs, and the movement of the embryo tickle:;
the sensitive nerves at the hair-roots; hence the
horse licks at those within reach, and so they are
swallowed and take up their home on the lining
membrane of the stomach. Many fall on the pas-
tures or into the feed of stabled horses, and arrive
at their interior abode that way. They don’t live
at the expense of the stomach tissue;; all nourish-
ment required comes from the secretion of the mucus
lining in which their heads are well buried. Treat-
ment is by fumigation. Bisulphide of carbon is
administered in a gelatine capsule, which dissolves
in the stomach, liberating the fumes, and as the
hot is. a breathing beast he gets it in his only vulner-
able department. The sheep botfly deposits its eggs
on the nostrils of the jumbuck, and the embryo
crawls up the nostrils and locates itself in the
sinuses of the head, where it finds mucus of such
quality that it grows nearly twice the size of the
equine fancier. The bot which lives under the skin
along the back is the largest of the family, and
common in Europe among cattle, but not horses.
Cattle imported to N. S, Wales are quarantined at
Abbotsford, and carefully watched and relieved of
these passengers before being allowed to join our
herds. The two branches of the family in N. S.
Wales are pest enough, and it is hoped Govern-
ment measures will continue successfully to exclude
the hide-destroying bovine cousin.

“Verde Gris” (N.T.) ; About 10 years
ago one of the Le Souefs brought to the Northern
Territory from Melbourne Zoo a few Asiatic deer.
They were liberated in the vicinity of
Port Essington, where their progeny
now flourishes. A Malay trepanger,
who still knocks about the bays of
the Coburg Peninsula, was given a
sort of guardianship over them, and
the blacks were cautioned that
if they interfered with them all
sorts of debbil-debbil things would
happen. The original contingent con-
sisted of about six pairs of red deer
arid a buck of the larger Samba kind
accompanied by a small harem of does.
This old buck was quite domesticated
by his Zoo experience, and soon made-
himself at home. He would stalk into
a niggers’ camp at night, scare away
the sleeping occupants by rooting at
them with his antlers, and then settle
down comfortably by their fire. An-
other of his pranks was to swim
out to a canoe-full of niggers and
scramble to get in by putting his
forefeet on the gunwale, and so over-
turn the whole show. Administrator
Gilruth once sent a man down to
Port Essington to manicure the tomb-
-t.unes of the 1838 settlement. The
man picked out a camping-spot, and
pitched his tent, but the old buck
ia me along, and, taking a fancy to
such a form of shelter, dug himself
in as star-boarder. The only time
he was ill-treated was when he
boarded a beached lugger and started
to eat the jib. The enraged owner of
the vessel shot him through the
• shoulder; but the buck’s Malay god-
father faithfully reported the occur-
rence to the police at Darwin, and
the marksman was fined a fiver with
costs under that part of the criminal
law which relates to domesticated
animals. This was in 1914. The
buck was lame after that. He has
not been seen much since, but the natives of the
district say he is still alive.
* * * *
"F.R.K.”: “Moran's” owe which reared
three lambs besides her own (B. 5/6/’24) reminds
me that at Guntawang (N.S.W.), in ’B7, a Clydes-
dale mare had a foal, and when two other draught
mares died leaving foals she reared the three.
About the same time another draught mare on
the same station died leaving a foal, and in that
instance a thoroughbred mare with a foal took the
orphan and reared it. So in the one paddock
we had two mares* rearing five foals.
* 44 * -X-
-“lnver G.”: I agree with “Centre” (B.
12/6/’24) that the magpie’s notes take some beat-
ing, bnt Maggie at her best is only an amateur
by comparison with the tui of Maoriland. That
silky-feathered, white-wattled warbler (a bird of
peculiar grace of form and movement, by the way)
possesses notes of a quality and variety unrivalled
by any other songster on earth. The phrase
“liquid notes” is peculiarly applicable to the tui’s
song, which is rich in the most delightful trills and
cadences. These birds are early risers, and anyone
who has heard them welcoming the dawn will
never forget it. In the South Island they have a
“bell'bird” that enthusiastic but misguided inhabi-
tants sometimes mention as a rival; but this dull
green singer is only a poor imitation of the tui.
Incidentally, what’s the matter with the musical
efforts of our cheery friend the wagtail—efforts
which the generous little chap is prepared to turn
on either in the daytime or at night?
PURELY DEFENSIVE.
PORKY (smiling): “Whatcha got all them on for, Baldly?
Goin’ t’ ride somethin’ at 6.7?”
LITTLE MAN: “Cut it out, Porky. Th’ missus’s mad on jumble sales, an’ I 'are t’ wear
me clothes aroun’ with me t’ know w’ere they are."
“Bouragi”: “Cartot” (B. 5/6/’24) says
the ancient Egyptian mummy-makers had to tie the
toe- and finger-nails on with string'because soaking
the corpses in natron loosened the nails, and that
the Torres Strait mummy-makers do similar tying
(using the same knot as the Egyptians), and have
no reason for doing so save that “it is the custom.”
But this isn’t good enough evidence to establish a
connection between New Guinea and Egypt. Soaking
in natron or anything else is not necessity to loosen
the nails of corpses. That happens inevitably by
natural processes. The allegedly similar knot may
be due to the fact that 99 per cent, of men, and ail
women, fasten a tie with a “granny.” As to
similar body incisions to those made by the Egyptians,
the two fine Torres mummies which once reposed
in Brisbane Museum showed no indications of inci-
sions for removing internal organs, as the inscription
on the case used to point out.
* * * *
“Mde”; “Alastor's” friend is probably cor-
rect in his suggestion of an alliance between, the
Queensland tiger-snake and the brown lizard (B.
12/6/’24) ; other observers have noted the close com-
panionsliip between the two. The
animal world contains many examples
of this curious association of en-
tirely diverse species, an association
which in most cases is based upon a
mutual advantage of some sent,
although often it is difficult to say
just what the benefit is. In New
Guinea there is the crocodile and
the small bird that is frequently to
be ’seen perched on the saurian's
back. The little chap is believed not
only to warn the crocodile when dan-
ger is about, but. also to act as an
animated toothpick, removing bits of
food which become wedged between
the reptile’s tooth. Another instance
is that of the shark and the pilot-
fish. But perhaps the most remark-
able of all is tlie frequent alliance
between the American rattlesnake and
the rabbit. These two totally dis-
similar creatures have been encoun-
tered living side by side in a rabbit-burrow, neither
apparently interfering with the other. In this case
the thing is the more extraordinary because the rabbit
is the natural prey.of the rattlesnake.
“A.F.”: “F.'s” mean man (B. 22/5/’24)
reminds me that soon after we went on the land and
before I (a city office-girl) had learnt to milk, my
husband was called away on urgent business, and
we arranged with a neighbor that if we ran our three
cows down he would milk them and keep the yield
for his labor. They were in full profit—l had been
making 251 b. of butter a week. My husband re-
turned a few days later, and when he went along to
collect the cows our neighbor intimated that as his
bull had paid some attention to one of the. visitors
(a courtesy we would rather not have had extended)
he would be obliged if my husband would hand over
10s. He got the 10 bob —and 1 learnt to milk.
“Cartot”: The allusion in the works o£
the Roman writer Lucian to the animal which “uses
its belly like a pouch” may have been meant for the
kangaroo, as suggested by “G.8.L.” (B. 12/6/’24) ;
but it is much more likely, that it was not. Some
years ago a writer in the Journal of the Royal Geo-
graphical Society advanced the opinion that it re-
ferred to a small marsupial, something like the
Australian and American opossum, which once iu-
habited parts of India and the F.ast. Thither
adventurous Roman galleys had made their ways long
before Lucian lived, and, in addition, there was
communication between the Roman Umpire and the
East by means of the caravan-routes, so that news of
an animal such as is mentioned could have been
obtained from a score or so different sources. While
there is some evidence which seems to suggest that a
Roman ship or ships actually made the long journey
from the Mediterranean or the Northern African
coast right down through Malaysia to New Guinea,
or perhaps Australia, one thing is certain —that the
adventurers never, got back again. Had they done
so, the whole world at that period would have rung
with their exploit, surely the greatest of all maritime
'feats. And if any of them had seen a kangaroo,
there would have been detailed reports of the animal,
instead of a vague reference in a more or less obscure
writer like Lucian, and an equally uncertain passage
in a poet like Manilius.
“H.0.F.” : I attended the other day to the
testamentary requirements of a middle-aged bushie
whose fingers and thumb on the right hand are ail
POST-A ND-RAIL POLITICS.
“Heard of the latest split in the Cover’meat, Bill?”
“No —anything leak out?”
half bent —permanently. He has been an axeman
since his youth, and medieoes tell him that ;iie,
sinews are “worn out.” The index finger of the left
hand is also bent, and the rest of the fingers have
already started inwards. He has never experience 1
any pain in either hand. The right now occupies
the exact position taken in swinging an axe, and the
owner philosophically states that the left will in due
course do likewise. Still toiling—but what com-
pensation is he due for ?

f Coot” : In the journal of Arthur Bowes,
surgeon on the Lady Penrhyn. one of the First Fleet,
thdre is an entry dated Feb. 16, 1788: “An alligator,
about Bft. long, was seen close by the camp, and has
beau amongst the tents at night.” Presumably the
“alligator” was a goanna. Is this the first appearance
of the go. in Australian history ?

THE MEN THAT UNDERSTAND.
[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
1 am no classical Red Page rhymester ;
1 sing my songs to the old bush hand.
The dwellers of bush camp, hut or hovel,
W ielding the axe or the pick and shovel,
By fire or hurricane-lamp they read me—
Simple rhymes of our own great land.
Those are the men that clothe and feed me ;
They’re the men that can understand!
The men that go by the stock-routes droving
Through unfenced bush with its silence grand,
Where the heat-waves race like mounted legions
Of Devil’s imps from red-hot regions,
Or sleepy autumn noons are drowsing,
And saltbush plains on the sight expand.
Deeply they think while the stock are browsing—
Those are the men that can understand!
And those that follow the roads for shearing,
And mingle sweat with the oil and sand,
While engines throb with an even drumming,
And combs and cutters and belts are humming;
And stooping low till their backs are aching—
The metal warms till it burns the hand—
Their forearms cramp till they’re almost breaking:
Those are the men that can understand!
The exiled waif of tlie inland station,
Wasting a life on a lonely strand,
With one wild week in the township yearly—
One week’s liberty, paid for dearly—
With hope and ambition all a-seatter,
He holds the reins in a shaking hand.
The years slip by, but it does not matter—
He’s still a man that can understand!
A DISGRACE TO HIS SEX.
VOICE FROM UP- STAGE: “ Strewth, Bill, where’s yer
blinkin’ manhood? Why don’t yer kick ’er in
the stummick !”
Hectic seekers of phantom fortunes—
They-are strong as lions in heart and hand!
Where the crashing battery-heads are stamping,
On every “new find” field they’re camping—-
Old sailors and soldiers, restless thinkers, •
Awaiting their mistress Luck's command,
Out-back hawkers and nomad tinkers —
They’re the men that can understand !
Shed-hand, jackeroo, boss and teamster—
They are the men that can understand!
Self-taught scholars and baffled dreamers,
Bronzed barge-hands of the river steamers—
They are the men I love to heed me
(Let furious critics reprimand)-
They are the men that clothe and feed me ;
And I’ll sing the tune that their ears demand.
N.s.w.

MALTHOID ROOFING
“Siwash”: Re “Pedro” and liis red cod
(B. 5/'6/’24). When in British Columbia I often
caught these finny fatheads, always in very deep
water and only at locally-known spots, but 1 never
saw one show any inclination to jib, either on being
hooked or when landed. The local theory was that
the decreasing pressure of the water as he was hauled
up affected the victim, and left him helpless when
landed. This seemed good enough to accept, in view
of the cod’s bulging eyes and dopey appearance, but
I never heard any suggestion as to why the fool
remained so passive and unresisting when first
hooked. Incidentally “Pedro” needn’t be shy if he
bags another —a feed off one compensates for the lack
of sport in landing him.
* * * *
“Wob”: All fish with distended mouths
are passive resisters. They attempt to swallow the
bait, nor bite it. The hook fastens in the throai.,
the mouth is opened wide, and the inrush of water
renders the fish hors de combat. Flathead come in
the same way if they are skull-dragged the first
few yards. I know “It’s not true” will be the chorus
to that, but try it, and then chip in.
“Baromi”: “Ex-Dig.” (B. 15/5/’24) and
Bill Carson, in writing of axeman “Jim McNully,”
evidently referred to Jim Mclnolty, one-time cham-
pion, whose record for two 2ft. logs still stands.
Old Bill Carson also erred when stating that Jackson
sailed in the Waratal) —it was Matthews and Calder
(of the Speck) who set out on the ill-fated trip.
Jackson and Peter McLaren took over their engage- .
ment, and after they had astonished the London
natives their co. shipped them to U.S.A., where they
are—or were until recently—receiving ovations from
Yankee audiences. Poor Jim Mclnolty went west
in Kew (Vic.) a few years ago; but the others
of the old crowd referred to by Bill are still going
strong.
* * * *
“Orney”: Re strange companionships
among animals. Our next-door station-owner has .1
doe-kangaroo which fraternises at mealtime with four
kittens. A week or so ago she and one of the
catlets disappeared for a whole day. In the evening
the ’roo came hopping home, and from her pouch
protruded the head of the kitten looking with ludi-
crous content upon the world.
* * * *
“H.G.D.” : A while ago some Abo. com-
mented on the drought-resisting power of the merino.
How’s this for an instance of the jumbuck’s endur-
ance? In February a farmer in south-west N.S.W.
was ploughing, when the horses took fright at a
deep hole 2ft. wide and 3ft. long. Looking down
he saw an eye shining in the darkness, and on
jumping in to investigate found a merino ewe. He
rescued the jumbuck, which he recognised as one
that had been missing for over a fortnight. She
was in the last stages of exhaustion and seemed
paralysed in the legs. It was with the greatest
difficulty that she was persuaded to swallow a few
mouthfuls of water. In five days, however, she was
eating well and had almost regained the use of her
limbs. Now, although still poor, she is as healthy
as the remainder of the flock.
“D.J.McL.” : Nine miles west of the dead
town of Milparinka (N.S.W.) there is a beefwood-
tree the bark of which has been chopped away to
HIS PEDIGREE.
“I Ihink I know that colt, Jacky. What name that
horse he’s by?”
“Mine tinkit you drunk. Can’t you see he’s by hisself?”
permit of a name and date being deeply carved on
the trunk—“ Poole, 1845.” Poole was a member
of Sturt’s party when he struck these parts in mid-
summer, and the tree marks his grave. There is a
more modern monument near the tree. This is a
sandstone column about 6ft. high which was cut and
polished by a station-hand of the district named
Dowd. He also carved Poole’s name and the date of
his death on the stone, but how long ago I cannot
discover.
“X.N.0.”: One of “Bouragi’s” explana-
tions of the littering of a South Coast (N.S.W.)
beach with young dead leatherjaekets (B. 12/6/’24)
cannot be accepted—the possibility of a Gin. shell
during target practice having been the assassin. War-
ships do not fire live shell at target practice, but
only shot of the same weight and shape as the shell.
The latter are reserved for use in action, and only
one or two are fired yearly from each gun, always
at an uninhabited rock. The object of this firing
is not to hit any particular spot, but to observe
the burst of the shell —deterioration, if any, is
NEAT.
“Water or soda, old man?”
“ Nothing, thanks. I hate to have my spirits
damped.”
betrayed by the color of the smoke. An isolated
rock near Wilson’s Promontory is used by the R.A.N. ;
and unless the fish climbed the rock during the
firing, the shell-bursts would leave them unper-
turbed.
“Murkali”: Here are two astonishing
examples of alluvial soil deposit. On the Hawkes-
bury (N.S.W.) flats recently, a farmer while grub-
bing a tree came upon an old survey-mark at a depth
of Cft. The average height of such marks being
3ft., a soil deposit of 9ft. in approximately 60 years
was indicated. The second example was on the
site of the famous Palmer gold-rush (N.Q.). At
a depth of 60ft., in what he had taken for virgin
country, a miner came across a winch in position—
proof that the overlaying 60ft. of soil had been
deposited there since the golden days of the Palmer
(i.e., the early ’seventies). This gives an average
rate of over a foot per annum. Sixty feet of soil
is in itself an astounding circumstance; but I saw
that bettered at Bacchus Marsh (Vic.), when workings
in connection with the damming of the Werribee
Gorge disclosed soil up to 115 ft. in depth—ripped
out of the mountains in the centuries by the tear-
ing Werribee River.
“Wee Bobbie”: The cheerful magpie
doesn’t take kindly to exile. A few years ago some
were let loose on the island of Guadalcanar (Br.
Solomons). The old birds seemed to hang on fairly
well, but the dinkum islanders were feeble and short
lived. I tamed two of them, but they lived only a
year or so. Somehow they never seemed at home,
never fitted into their surroundings ; but it was good
to hear their, cheery whistle when malaria made bne
low-spirited of a morning.
* * * *
“Morob” : I would be glad if “Te Baba-
rantiko” would tell me what are the words for
“cruelty” in the majority of native dialects spoken
along the north-eastern coast of
New Guinea, since he asserts that
this word has an equivalent in
even the most obscure island dia-
lects (B. 12/6/’24). In 1918 I
spent six months or so collecting
native vocabularies in this part of
New Guinea on behalf of an Eng-
lish scientific body, and never once
did I come across “cruelty” in any
of the dialects there. Most of
them are extremely restricted,
some having as few as 40 and 50
words in them, and in practically
all of them the terms deal with
simple and primary objects, it
being rare to find one of an ab-
stract nature, as “cruelty” is. It
is possible that there is such an
expression in the languages of the
Southern Pacific, since the people
there are of a comparatively
higher culture, having reached
that part of the ocean by another
migration-stream; but I am sure
there is no such word in the majority of New Guinea
dialects, simply because the idea expressed by it
does not exist in the minds of the natives.
* * * *
“The Rumpus”: A wire-nettirg fence is
a greater wind-shield than you would think. I was
going home me night with an old bushie, when an
easterly sprang up and blew so hard that my com-
panion had to hold on to his whiskers. I tried a
few 7 times to light my pipe, but was unsuccessful,
so the old chap suggested getting in the lee of
a wire-netting fence. 1 laughed at him, but found
he was in earnest. The next minute he had ranged
alongside the fence and had a light going—jumpy
certainly, but burning.
“Kobbi” : “Billo C.’s” Mrs. Boniface Mio
used to irrigate her best geraniums with stale beer
(B. 15/5/’24) recalls an old Pittsworth (Q.) public-
house man —he gave a beery hand to a young pepper-
ina alongside his horse-rail. The result was one of
the finest trees in both size and shape in Queensland.
Its diameter was a little under 3ft. The pub has
since vanished, but the tree still flourishes, thus show-
ing the persistent virtue of beer. Allot tier “house’"
up the street has something of a rival. Whether it
was brought up on the bottle, too, I don’t know,
but it is certainly stout enough to be a descendant
of Bung.
* * * *
“Hayband”: In 1918 a Parramatta
(N.S.W.) man sent a basket of homing-pigeons tor
release at Bathurst. The last one reached home a
week ago, bearing the marks of long caging. Appa-
rent lv it had escaped and homed — after six years.
Another odd case of homing after a long interval
concerned a Bathurst-bred horse. For 13 years he
worked and wandered unchecked about Blacktown
(N.S.W.). Then one day his homing instinct ex-
humed itself and he left for Bathurst, 130 miles
away, and reached it in due course.
“W. 8.5.”: Talking of queer foster-
mothers. In this district (N.Q.) a sow that gave
birth to six piglets showed her maternal affection
by eating two. The surviving four were taken from
her, but after a time two of them were returned
and she mothered them with evident pleasure. In
no circumstances, however, would she have anything
to do with the remaining two ; so an old cattle-slut
took on the job, and the way she performed her
new duties was a credit to her. But now comes
a curious fact. The two youngsters reared by the
sow, having grown up, have had a couple of litters
each, whereas those reared by the dog are barren.
* * * *
“Veedee H.”: At Gisborne (M.L.) re-
cently a horse was seen wandering along with a
rider clinging on, his arms around the animal’s neck
and the bridle trailing on the ground. Thinking it
was a case of “drunk again,” a passer-by called for
help to remove the inebriate from the saddle, and by
the time the horse 1 had been stopped a small crowd
had gathered. Someone slapped the rider on the
back and demanded what he was doing. To the
surprise of everyone, he sat up quickly, rubbed his
eyes, and inquired “What’s the game?” Everyone
was astounded when he explained that he must have
fallen asleep as he rode along. The man was per-
fectly sober, and, digging his heels into his steed,
made off at a gallop.
* * * *
“Terrick Terrick”: In reference to
“FY7’s” remarks about the savage horse on this sta-
tion in 1891 (B. 15/5/’24), it may interest him to
know that the man who was maltreated by the stal-
lion is still employed here. He is almost part of
the station, having seen many changes and worked
under many managers. He can neither read nor
write and does not know his own age, but is a good,
trustworthy hand. He recently asked the boss for a
holiday, saying, “A coupla fortnights will do me.”
* * * *
“Liss”: The staggers was responsible for
100-odd casualties in a mob of 3500 wethers I was
once droving to Bourke (N.S.W.). As it was a
particularly dry spell there was none of that juici-
ness or succulence about the herbage that “Lily-
Beale” writes of (B. 29/5,/’24). A heavy shower
of rain fell as we drew on to a stretch of black
country, and the jumbucks, who were perishing for
water, raced about a great deal in spite of our efforts
to put them together and camp them. The deaths
all Occurred within the next hour. Bleeding at the
nostril and eye-veins proved ineffectual.
* * * *
“Yardley”: “Brud” (B. 5/6/’24) jests
about the smell of shark’s-liver oil. I shall never
again think of it as a joke. I was once one of the
crew of a ship becalmed in the Bay of Bengal, and
our skipper sought to lighten the tedium by allowing
an occasional spell at shark-fishing. The livers were
exposed to the sun, and the oil soaked into the
timber of the decks. A day came when the stink
■would have stopped a clock; the following day it
was - suffocating; later, it grew so terrible that we
began to talk seriously or taking to the boats for a
breath of air.
* * * *
“Deejaybee”: The other day near Kerang
(Vic.) I saw a small flock of crows and another of
magpies mixed up in a battle royal in mid-air.
While I watched, a big hawk soared close to the
battle area, and suddenly, as if by a signal, the crows
and magpies had forgotten their differences and joined
forces against the newcomer. In a short while they
had compelled him to make a forced landing and
take shelter under a bush not 20yds. from where 1
stood. Taking no notice of me whatever, the newlv-
allied force maintained the offensive and eventually
pursued the hawk out of range of my vision. Are
these sudden alliances common?
“Scapa Floe”: While out mustering the
other day I kicked aside a lump of manure and
discovered a weird-looking specimen making a meal
of an earth-worm. It was much the same color as
the worm, rather slimy, and its body was not unlike
the top portion of an old-patterned rubber tobacco-
pouch, while the head and mouth resembled the
sucker of a sucker-fish. It appeared to have no
eyes, but lost no time in endeavoring to recede into
its hole. I unearthed it with a stick, and, not
liking to handle the loathsome thing, left it on the
ground while I obtained an old tin. When I got
back it was gone. Can any Abo. tell me what it is ?
“Te Pana”: Anyone who has seen the
giant canoes in use in Pacific Islands can easily
credit the stories of long voyages made by Poly-
nesians in their migrations. At Tabutanea, in the
Gilberts, there is one sea-going dugout 78ft. long,
and on its trial run it carried 97 passengers in
comfort. It has a beam of 6ft., and is about the
same from keel to main deck. Outrigger canoes are
common in all Pacific Islands except Samoa, where
they have been discarded in favor of whaleboats.
Some of these are fine craft, seating as many as
30 rowers.
“Billy See” : Round about the W.A. gold-
fields grows a timber which for want of a better
name is called native pine. Being chockful of
turpentine and resin, it is a perfect resistant to
white ants, and is largely used for fence-posts, etc.
It has a stringy bark, resembling the noted eucalypt
of that name, and is very inflammable. In the early
days a woodcarter, perched on top of a loa.l,
carelessly threw a lighted match behind him. The
whole caboose took fire. It was broiling summer
weather, and the flames spread so rapidly that he
was hard pushed to save his horse. The dray, which
wasn’t a tip, was reduced to axle and tyres.
* * * *
“Dave Shep”: How is this for a record
murder? While inspecting some pastoral country
west of Townsville (N.Q.) I came across a dingo
camp, and snugly huddled up therein was a healthy
family of 11 pups. Their execution had just been
completed when the parents appeared from a gully
where they had been having an early dinner with a
cocky’s calf on the menu. Two shots from a .32
Winchester completed the casualty list. Has any
Abo. ever collected a bigger bag before breakfast?
DEUCED INCONVENIENT.
MATE: “Newehum, eh? Bet you miss your
little mattress.”
CHUM: “Too right! I can’t no way keep
my trousers pressed.”
“Adamascus”: At Rockhampton (C.Q.)
the other day, two men were fishing from the bank
of the Pitzroy River, when a large sea-hawk alighted
quite close to them. It showed no desire to move,
so they made a rush and captured it after a sharp
tussle. The bird had evidently just gorged itself
and was too full to fly. On being measured the hawk
was found to be 6ft. 9in. from tip to tip. Rock-
hampton is 30 miles from the sea.
*'* * *
“Wee Bobbie”: Has any tropical Abo.
ever noticed malaria fever in animals ? I had a
half-bred bulldog who got it as regularly as I did
myself. He was a humorous, laughing-faced old
chap until an attack came on; then he hung his
head and drooped his tail, and all the cats in Poly-
nesia could sing their love-songs on the back fence
and not make him lift an eyelid. All that tyke
wanted when he got fever was to be left alone. He
ran a temperature and moaned in his sleep like any
human sufferer with the plaguey disease. Five
grains of quinine soon had him right again.
MORNING MUSINGS.
[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
Scrape ! scrape! scrape!
Each morning I have to shave;
And then with a tonic to coax the hair
The top of my head I lave.
And this is the song I sing
While giving the blade a shove:
“Why can’t I be bald upon the chin
And have whiskers that grow above ?”

Polo in Sydney is not the esoteric rite,
conducted amidst a well-bred hush, that
Ranelagli and Hurlingham know. It is be-
ginning to rival League football in popu-
larity and uproar. The “right people” have
taken it up; and intense local patriotisms are
aroused by the district team system—an
arrangement that identifies the women with
the game to a far greater extent than the
inter-regimental matches which prevail in
England and India. And to give the game
its due it is intensely exciting when played
by two such sides as Cressbrook and Mus-
wellbrook, who were in the Dudley Cup finals.
Sydney enthusiasts included the G.-G. and
Lady Forster; Mrs. Pitt Rivers, looking
like a tall Greek goddess disguised in a coat
and skirt; the Dudley Gibsons (who are no
longer country folk, having settled at Rose
Bay ) ; Mrs. Jimmy Burns, Mrs. Otway
Falkiner (who was with the vice-regals) ; all
the younger members of the Knox and
Arthur Allen families; Ken Austin, the
organiser of the show, and the imperishable
George Lambert.
State Governor Dudley de Chair and his
lady gave another happy party last week.
This time the guests were bidden in the even-
ing, and there was music and a wireless pro-
gramme (in one of the smaller rooms) and
dancing. It was, as usual, one of the least
formal of gatherings, from the minute the
delectable Captain Coote announced the
names till the owners tore themselves away.
Lady de Chair, who might have been Queen
Maeve dressed by Paris, flew grass-green,
whose shoulder-panel effect merged into a
drawn-out thread of train that wriggled
seductively. Her lasso of pearls and emerald
ear-rings rounded off the whole. Sir Dudley,
with all his medals gleaming, dodged the sta-
tionary handshake, and wove a long trail of
charm, moving from group to group the
length of the room. Polo-players were there,
some with their scars upon them, others with
merely their wives; and an interesting four-
some were the Ross brethren. Toti dal Monte
and Phyllis Archibald, both wrapped about
in gaily broidered shawls, made a notable
entry; Prince Obolensky and O’Shea were
others from the aviary.
In spite of radiators and the avenue of red
carpets and glowing poiusettia that skirted
the dancing spaces, the air of the Palais
Royal had an edge to it on the night of the
Queen’s Club Ball; but the hardy sex wan-
dered about in the jazz intervals bare-necked
and bare-armed, the Club’s immortelles being
more debonair in the matter than the debs,
of the latest blossoming. The electrics in
the funny little pens wore black and white
shades proudly blazoned with a Q that at
first glance suggested an advertisement for
“life-savers,” and every second one or so
had a distance-breaking bannerette of
streamers at its entrance. In addition to
these splendors, the vice-regal lodge had a
ruby carpet. The State Exes, arrived at 9.40,
Lady de Chair in a trained Worth gown of
silver lame, just low enough at the back to
reveal a flashing pair of dimples. Five min-
utes later the Forster entourage entered. The
G.-G.’s lady was in black and gold brocades
and was diamonded about head and throat;
Mrs, Pitt Rivers wore cloth of silver with
an embossed lilac flush.
The crowd was immense, subbuban and
country members having rallied in force.
Clever women with real money in their
frocks didn’t seek the obscurity of boxes, but
made a possy for' themselves on the outer
rim. Mrs. Sep Levy, looking like a piece: of
Persian red glaze in her velvet frock, flashed
its diamond buckler in the rays from a jazz
umbrella. Others who sought the pro-
menade were the attractive Mrs. Wills-Allen
with her guests, the good-looking Winter-
Irvings from Melbourne. A late-comer was
Mrs. George Yivers, in the grey of a twilight
cloud warmed by a lingering sunset. Lady
Lawford (she was once Mrs. Toby Watt),
whose dark shingled head and shoulders
emerged from orange georgettes, was another
of the night’s good-lookers. Melbourne was
represented by the Wertheim couple and by
Mrs. Harry Whiting, whose panelled opal-
escence was outstanding even in a night so
beaded that the Melanesian Mission could
have collected enough clothing for the whole
of its native population.
The returned soldiers of the Union Club
entertained their brothers in arms of the
Australian Club on Saturday night, and about
150 ex-warriors roared a hearty “No!” to
the “Any complaints?” with which General
Eyrie prefaced his after-dinner speech. Brig-
adier-General George Onslow, who responded
for the Australian Club men, intimated that
the merry gathering would probably be an
annual affair; and then the guests dispersed,
some to fight their battles over again in
the smoking-room, and many of the younger
men to Merioola and the last of the polo-
week dances.
The Palais Royal Ball on Friday night in
aid of the Kambala purchase fund will
drop a big sum into the coffers. Girls past
and present mustered in great force and
brought plenty of partners. The frocking
was smart, gay jazz-caps made the scene
look more frolicsome, and lucky bags yielded
a Noah’s Ark supply of weird animals and
much merriment. The supper was arranged
on long tables which Mrs. Edmund Playfair
had decorated with colorful Iceland poppies.
The principals of the college, the Misses
Roseby, came to help with the fun, and
looked very happy as one after another of
the old girls greeted them. Mrs. John Dent,
president of the committee, danced in a
gown of black marocain with a big fringed
sash and touches of deep rose pink. Doreen
Young and Jessie McMaster were treasurers ;
the former was in silver and the latter in
black.
The toast is Maggie Moore! For 50 years
the sunny personality behind this Howard
Harris picture has created living, human
women upon the Australian stage. As a
slim brunette
she won hearts
in the long
ago by her
sparkling in-
t erpretations
of comic-
opera hero-1,
i n e s. The
older genera-
tion still tell
of her charms
in “S truck
Oil,” which
was the key-
stone of the
fortunes of J.
C. William-
son. Never
grumbling at
Time or Fate,
Maggie Moore
has stepped
from the tiny
dancing - shoes
of long ago into the more comfortable ones
that fit the low comedy she now plays. Her
work has always been perfect of its kind;
and she has had the priceless gift of comedy
that is a rainbow mixture of smiles and
tears. And her heart is so big and her dis-
position so helpful that of the profession
to-day she is the most beloved! The benefit
which her brothers and sisters will ask her
to accept in celebration of the fiftieth anni-
versary will be made something to remember.
In spite of there being no chickens at the
Polo Ball—this applies to the supper, not
the dancers —the flutter came nearer to
thoroughly warming up the Palais than any-
thing in all its previous history. A jolly
affair —nearly 2000 strong, though sounding
more like 200 when the chantey part of the
programme was set going. The vice-regal
party came on from the opera, and smiled
on the money-spinner for the Country
Women’s Association. Lady Forster was in
black, with an overdress glittering with
emerald fires. Mrs.' P’itt Rivers, president of
the function, wrapped herself and her
blushes in geranium pink, and made a beam-
ing excursion from loge to loge accepting con-
gratulations on the evening’s success. Lady
tie Chair was with her Viking, in a shimmer
of black velvet, sleeveless, and moored with
jewelled shoulder-straps. The Association's
secretary, Marie Irvine, kept blue satins
cosy under her fur coat; and Mrs. P. Minell
was an eye-opener in shot mauve and pink
marocain, with a deep band of ostrich feather
billowing about the skirt. Mrs. Sep Lev\
received her court in Rose du Barry up-
holstery. Poet Harry Lawson’s daughte”
was in the throng, pretty Vivienne Manchee
weighted white georgettes with crystal, Mrs.
Edward Ward’s frocking was a nocturne in
black lace and silver, Mrs. J. J. Smith turned
on old gold and fine diamonds, and Mrs.
George Sly was in black panne. Muswell-
brook foregathered at her bit of the Palais,
which boxed Mrs. Pearse and Mrs. H. White.
Mrs. Jack Playfair flew almond-green dra-
peries; and busy Mrs. James Ashton’s blue-
and-gold frock was the will o’ the wisp of
the evening—and her three tall sons showed
an active foot in the jazz and a discerning
eye for beauty in partners.
Grand Opera audiences so far show no sign
of getting frayed at the ears. Circles and
stalls are still tightly packed. The Vice-
Regal soul bathes in waves of melody each
first night; glittersome Mrs. Jimmie Burns
and Mrs. Sep Levy, wrapped in her really
and truly Russian sable (not mink, as mere
people believe), are others of Sydney’s musi-
cally starved who pick at least an olive from
the banquet; and Mrs. Pitt Rivers puts in
a regular if sometimes belated appearance.
Bertie Kelly is always with us, and clever
Josie Melville brought her slim body and her
tiny scrap of a face to the first night of "lhe
Barber.” Shawls are as thick as thieves in
Vallombrosa, and many of them as beautiful.
As the nights grow colder there is a tendency
to burrow into furs and wraps, and let the
onlookers take the beauty of one’s arms for
granted. The Tait girls, down from i ren-
sham, were boxed with father early in the
week, and everybody who was in town for
Polo “took in” at least one night of the
opera. And always the upper circle is
crowded with the real music-lovers —Conser-
vatorium girls and boys and business lads
and lasses having an orgy.
The week closed in a blaze of social fire-
works on Saturday evening, when the Aus-
tralia, the Wentworth and Ussher’s simply
crackled with diners and dancers ; but many
of the diners went straight on to the big
ball at the Arthur Allen home, or to the other
at the Rose Bay Golf Club.
Louis Nettement, the new Consul for
France, who arrived by the Niagara, is no
stranger to Sydney. _ About 20 years ago he
was Deputy-Consul in the reign of M. Biard
d’Aunet—he who afterwards married a rich
Sydney widow. Associated with him when
last in these parts was the picturesque young
Count Peretti de la Rocca, who was after-
wards drowned in Central America. As
Nettement is the son of a French father and
an American mother, and was born in Eng-
land, his birth notice must have read like
an Allied communique.
Good Americans and others celebrated the
Glorious Fourth at the Ambassadors with
turkey and cranberry and—and things that
it isn’t so easy to get “back borne.” The
big room was crowded. Lots of the polo
visitors were scattered about—one English-
man plaintively exclaimed, “I came here to
facet Americans, but they seem hard to
find !” But Consul Lawton was there, and
Colonel (or is it Captain?) Evans, the
nice ex-Governor of Pago.
Breathless news from Cockaigne:—
High Commissioner Cook’s wife is seen in quite
a new r6le these days. She holds rehearsals for
Australian debutantes who are to make their bows
at their Majesties’ courts, and shows them how 10
make the curtsey so there will be no danger of
falling in front of the Throne.
On the eve of the Queen’s Club Ball
the engagement of Mary Mort and popular
Dr. Barton, of Wellington, was broadcasted.
Mary’s people are the Arthur Morts, of
Bananaland, and she is a sister of Mrs. Hill,
whose husband was Lieut. Hill, of “The Road
to En-dor” fame. The Hills, by the way,
are spending a furlough in Australia.
Dainty Ronnie Bourke, from Bananaland,
is showing a diamond ring which Noel
Slacken, of Baklry, Cumnock, slipped on her
finger this week. There will be a wedding
in the spring.
Pretty and much-travelled Fay Ainsworth
has capitulated to the Irish blue eyes of Harry
Hardy—he’s Seymour Hicks’s six-foot-odd
manager. It was a shipboard romance, and
the wedding is fixed for a not-too-distant date.
Phyllis Archibald had a surprise the other
evening when the heart of a bouquet flashed
into a diamond bar-brooch. The Delilah lady
is to be Lady de Chair’s guest at Govern-
ment House towards the end of the operatic
season.
.Here is Gerald Walenn, leader of the new
string quartet at the Conservatorium, which
is giving Syd-
ney a taste of
its powers at
a series of
vivid chamber
concerts. Mr.
Walenn hails
from London,
where he
studied at the
Royal Acad-
emy with Pros-
per Sainton
and later with
Emile Sauret.
He has toured
Britain, Can-
ada and the
United States,
and was one
of the first
violinists to
play at the
Queen’s Hall
Sunday - after-
noon concerts. As a student lie was com-
manded to play for Queen Victoria and
her Court, and was afterwards congratulated
in the most flattering way. In 1917 Adelaide
chose Mr. Walenn for her Conservatorium,
and there he stayed till the energetic and
discerning Arundel Orchard plucked him for
Sydney.
Tenor Charles Hackett is raising his fare-
well song on behalf of the new Catholic
Women’s College within the Uni. Clever
Mrs. Toohey netted the bird for this cause
when he was telling her he’d like to help
some charity. July 24 is the date fixed, and
Dame Nellie has been given a gentle hint
to see that no operatic first-night clashes
with the Town Hall concert.
Nellie Stewart will preside at a meeting
of the committee for the Artists’ Ball in the
banquet hall of the Australia to-morrow (Fri-
day) at 3. The Town Hall will again house
the revels, and the slogan is: “Let’s all be
kids again !”
Riverview is scouting for funds for its
war memorial. The River school had over
350 enlistments, and GO of them stay on in
France and Gallipoli. The form of the
memorial has not yet been decided: it will
either be a new study hall or a monument
on the foreshore which will be visible for
miles around. Meantime the Rainbow Dan-
dies and other entertainment committees are
embarking on a series of frivols for the
cause.
The girls of Monte Sant’ Angelo will hold
their second annual dance at the Wentworth
next Tuesday. The object is to endow a
bed at the Mater Misericordise Hospital.
Margaret Jaye has come back from her
travels with a riot ot gay designs in her
mind’s eye. The first thing she intends to
do is to unload lamp-shades, cushions, cur-
tains and bedspreads upon Sydney, and in-
cidentally give an art show. Her specialty
is designing stage sets, and her schemes for
making the home beautiful should appeal
to every just-beginning bride, or bride about
to begin again.
The clever Titheradges are busy making
sunshine for London. Madge, looking child-
like and wearing beautiful clothes, is
acting in company with the brilliant Du
Maurier at Wyndham’s. Borther Dion’s last
revue, “Puppets”—music by Ivor Novello —-
is one of the season’s successes. He has
just bought and moved into “If Winter
Comes” Hutchinson’s house in St. John’s
Wood.
Incidentally, Mrs. Herrick Knowles has
given up the Rose Bay flat while her doctor-
husband is looking into some special medical
work in Europe, and is putting up at the
Green Gate in Gordon. She is also giving
the benefit of the beautiful Titheradge diction
to Janet Stephen’s little salon in the T.
and G.
A Brisbane postscript:—
His Ex., with A. F. Partridge to explain matters,
has had a tour of the irrigation works out Dawson
Valley way. Camboon station housed them for the
week-end, and they were entertained by the Com-
missioner for Irrigation, and inspected the weir-to-be
at Delusion Creek (inauspicious name!) before going
on to the Glebe property. The Nathan dam site was
also looked over by tne Governor, and a visit to
Black Brother at Taroom finished the tour.
At His Majesty’s the Vanbrugh-Boucicaults are
having a royal season, all our smartest gathering
there nightly. A party to Irene Vanbrugh was giveii
by the members of the Brisbane Women’s Club. Miss
Highficld voiced the welcome, and the star was handed
violets and an address book. Music backed the
afternoon tea, and there was a big roll up of members
and friends.
The Biggs-Foster wedding was a very gay affair.
St. John’s Cathedral staged the first part and the
Bellevue the second. Bride Dorothy was in silver
crgpe tissue under an old lace veil caught with
orange blossoms. The ’maids were Jean Widdis
(Melbourne), Hilda Hudson and Marjorie Woodhouse,
and best-man F. Biggs had the assistance of Errol
Campbell and V. Grenning. Over a hundred guests
disported at the Bellevue amid jonquils and rosesj
silver doves and Iceland poppies. The beams of the
’moon will be shed over Sydney and Kosciusko. : :
Bob Cummings carried off the Queensland Wattle
Day League prize for architecture with a fine piece
of work. He is now’ off: to London, and a farewell
tea was staged for him at Finney’s.
An interesting Toowoomba wedding was that of
Mary Grant to Bob Sword, of Ascot, Brisbane, at
St. Stephen’s Kirk. Minister Reid, of Dalby, did the
job. The bride, who is a daughter of the Brig.-
General Grants, of Bowenville, was in ivory bro-
cade, and carried a sheaf of arum-lilies and white
gladioli. Jean Grant bridesmaided in blue with
pink rosebuds, and Donald Sword best-manned. The
reception was at the Club Hotel. Mary Grant, by
the way, was one of the Prince’s chief jazzing part-
ners when he was here.
Much wattle went to the decorating of the South
Brisbane City Hall for the Anzac Club Ball; yellow
streamers and red poinsettia also did their bit, and
the R.S.S.I.L.A. did the rest. Among the crowd
of 300 jazzers were the William Lennons, the
General Bruches and Mrs. Tom Ryan.
In rose-pink the H. C. Morrow dame tea-ed about
70 in honor of daughter Gladys’s approaching wed-
ding. Iceland poppies and nasturtiums lit the recep-
tion-rooms, and Constance Buchan sang.
The Craigend Old Girls and the Law Students fixed
their dances for the same evening, the first in St.
Andrew’s and the other in the South Brisbane Hall,
Craigend had a lot of gold, blue and red (their
colors) in the decorations, while the Law Students ran
to black and white and balloons. There was a record
attendance at both.
The C.T.A. spread a tea on the lawns at the Club,
and president and Mrs. Twamley said “How d’ye
do” to a big gathering after past-president McKay
had handed Mrs. Twamley a bunch of roses, camel-
lias and hyacinths tied with pink.
Everyone sported her best furs at Tattersall’s
races. Mrs. Levien’s >vere worn over a black maro-
cain. Mrs. Cecil Palmer was in grey and Mrs, Tully
in navy with hints of red ; brown furs were donned
by Mrs. A. R. Menzies over her navy, while Mrs.
Glyn Connolly wore navy mixed with grey.

"Phones, Control 1632, 1633.
Big' crowds went joyously in an unexpected
burst of sunshine to Flemington for Satur-
day's first Grand National outing. The big
vice-regal pen yawned emptily, however.
Governor Stradbroke and his brown-garbed
Countess were out, of course, but after a
very brief occupation they tied from its
emptiness to the horsey end of the stands.
Their Exes.’ racing hopes thudded cruelly
when their Spearsum, a hot favorite for the
Irimoo Stakes, finished an also-ran. Most
of the best-dressers hid their frocks under
furs, but a handful of the sex, out for notice,
gambled with pneumonia in spring-like rig.
One, bare-armed, shivered in silks of Tut-
tishly-patterned green. The Hymn of Hate
was raised in the grandstand by a group of
angry early arrivals over the casual workmen
who had forgotten to fly a “mind-the-paint”
notice on some of the seats.
ITiminister Bruce’s wife warmed a black
outfit with squirrel furs. Mrs. Alan Currie
topped sand-colored tailorings with parrot-
like effects on her hat. Admiral Hall Thomp-
son's wife had astraehan-grey trimmings on
her green frock, and the William Leonard,
Dick Casey and Byron Moore matrons,
who foregathered in the committee box,
were all in black. The silver-haired Millie
Carter sported a black velvet picture-
hat feathered with blue. Mrs. Sep
Miller was tartaned under a brown
toque, Mrs. Norman Falkinor moved round
coated in brown with gold embroidery, and
Mrs. Clarke’s fairness emerged from mole-
colored dressings. The Simon Fraser
widow, in workmanlike tailorings of brown,
was in the stand. One woman carried jvhat
looked like a parrot in rigor mortis on her
head. Incidentally, the up-to-the-minute
craze for lurid colors was trumpeted by
several loud millinery blasts, crude blues,
cruder greens and hectic reds and yellows
being all jumbled together deliriously.
Dr. Crawford Mollison’s elder son, Derek
(his late mother was a daughter of Rolf
Boldrewood Browne), claimed the E. 0.
Ludbfokes’ second daughter the other night
amid wattle decorations at the Melbourne
Grammar Chapel. The bridal satin, which
trailed its creamy folds above a side-panelling
scattered over with pearls and silver, had a
fragile back-curtain of Brussels lace. A
headache band of the same lace moored the
frothing tulle veil, and green orchids fluttered
amid the whiteness of her sheaved roses.
Sister Beryl Ludbroke and Enid Hodgson
’maided in mauve taffetas bronzed with
gleaming lace, and had mauve tulle billowing
from floral headgear to match their hand
posies. Two mauve-frocked tots, niece Joyce
Wittman and Bottina Bowen Jones, divided
their infantile interests between the bridal
train and the elaborately dressed dollies
cuddled in their arms. Gerard Noel and
Neville Whiting took charge of the ’groom,
whose six-feet-two failed to entirely over-
shadow the bride’s graceful height. The
cake was cut at No. 9 Darling-street, where
Mrs. Ludbroke topped honey-colored lace
with a black hat, and the bridegroom’s half
sister, Dorothy Mollison (one of our golfing
champs.), stood by in pink crepe with a
beaded glitter. It was a pleasant, cheerful
gathering with a jazz ending.
Mrs. Edith Waterworth, the Tas. publicist
and a possible inheritor of the Assembly seat
of the Speck’s Agent-General-elect, Colonel
Snowden, is at present holiday tripping in
the U.S.A. The good lady seems to dis-
approve of Uncle Slam’s railway sleepers.
“The sexes are mixed in a manner to scan-
dalise a respectable Tasmanian,” she says,
“and a woman travelling alone may very well
have a fat, unpleasant, snoring man in the
berth above her. Of course the passengers
are all separated by thick curtains, and every -
body is used to the arrangement—but it
leaves a great deal to be desired.” This page
hastens to blushingly mention that Mrs.
Waterworth is not travelling alone, and is
therefore unlikely to have had actual personal
experience of a horror in the top bunk. Her
highly-respected optician husband is holiday-
ing with her, and he is neither fat nor un-
pleasant—-also his Hobart neighbors have
never publicly complained that he snores.
At Salt Lake City the Waterworths met a
daughter of Brigham Young’s sixth wife.
“She believed polygamy was right,” remarks
Mrs. W., “and was a virtuous and cultured
woman It seemed very strange to me;
but I must confess to a breathless interest
in it!”
That nice-looking English girl, Rita Selby,
who made such a host of pals during her
long stay here, coo-ees from London that she
is to be married in September to one Lionel
Reuben. Before she left for England Rita
farewelled her friends with a wonderful
dance at Carlyon’s.
Lady Stradbroke’s Direct Giving appeal,
which filled the city walks with big pillar-
boxes on Friday, yielded £4700. The Gov-
ernor and his wife arrived at the Town Hail
early in the morning to post the first cheque,
and Lady Helena I'ous had a busy time
visiting the suburban pillars as understudy
for her vice-regal mamma. The silence of
the appeal was broken by several misguided
women shaking collecting-boxes under the
noses of passers-by. One giver, describing
himself as a working-man, deposited a
nugget of gold worth £25 as his mite.
Only relations and a few special pals were
asked to the chapel to see the Queen’s Col-
lege chief, the Rev. E. Sugden, seal daugh-
ter Katherine to John Woodhouse. Tlr;
latter’s clerical brother Herbert lent a hand
with the job. The bride was in snowy satin
draperies, angel-sleeved with georgette, and
had a top-dressing of very ancient real-lace
veiling clamped to her head with orange
flowers. A tiny niece, Muriel Gardner, all
pink and white with a flower-bordered cap
on her baby curls, trotted importantly behind
Auntie Kath, who was further ’maided by
sister May and Prof. Berry’s daughter
Muriel, in mauve marocain with pink side-
frillings and mauve veils a-flutter from head
anchorages of pink flowers. Two more of
the bride’s nieces led the wedding march
down the aisle, showering rose petals before
the newly-weds. Red vers Vickery and M.
Burtinshaw attended to the bridegroom.
The wedding-tea was held in the Sugden
home. The bridegroom, who is the second
son of Methodist-pillar Joseph Woodhouse, of
Sydney, will carry Mrs. John off to Young
(N.S.W.).
Meet actor Kay Souper’s charming daugh-
ter Irene. The damsel made up her mind
early to follow
dad’s foot-
steps, and got
her baptism
of limelight in
Cairo. She is
now continu-
ing the climb
to stage fame
as understudy
to Mary Mac-
Gregor at the
King’s. Lately
she discovered
herself to be
the possessor
of a clear,
nicely-
volumed sing-
in g voice,
which is now
being shaped
by Theophilus
Roberts, so
there is just a
chance that the little lady’s dramatic aspira-
tions will be swamped in comic opera. The
photo was made by Ruskin.
Inigo Freeman Thomas, Lord Willingdon’s
son and heir, has just engaged himself to
the Forbes-Robertsons’ eldest daughter,
Maxine, a beauteous young thing who is
Blossom in the home circle, to avoid con-
fusion with her actress-aunt Maxine Elliott.
Blossom has some talent as a water-colorist,
a gift from her dad, who was earning some
success as an artist before he changed his
brush for the grease-stick. Like her youthful-
looking mother, Gertrude Elliott,,the bride-
elect is keen on sport, and usually works up
an appetite for her breakfast bacon with a
brisk canter in the Row. Sister .Tean is
on the stage under mamma’s wing as
Anne McLean, while the baby of the family
trio (there is no son), a bobbed-haired chick
of nine or thereabouts, promises to become
a caricaturist. The lion. Inigo, who is 34,
spent some of his earliest years in this State
when his dad gent.-helped his vice-regal
father in-law, Lord Brassey.
Brassey, by the way, was the despair of
his officially-minded aides. He had homely-
tastes, and, the legend goes, would fre-
quently give his helps the slip and trot off
on his ownsome to breakfast with the Buck-
leys and such. Society of the late ’nineties
still grins over Brassey’s first official hop,
thereafter known as the Coffee Essence Bail.
Supper for the guest-in-ordinary consisted
of assorted cakes, washed down with coffee-
essence seasoned with condensed-milk. Pre-
sumably the then vice-regals learned a thing
or two between that shivoo and their next,
at which champagne flowed freely through the
mariy-coursed menu. Another little happen-
ing which helps to keep the memory of that
first ball green was the refusal to open the
doors before the hour mentioned on the in-
vitation pasteboards. Even in those days
of a more studied politeness, local society
had contracted the habit of arriving at a
function fully half an hour before it had
been bidden. Still, Melbourne failed to take
even such a broad hint, and apparently the
Brasseys decided against repeating the effort
to enforce the golden rule, as the next time
the invited put in a too-previous appearance
they found the doors wide open.
Just before her return to the West singer
Violet Concannon was cheered with a tea-
drinking at the Oriental, hostessed by Mrs.
H. J. Robertson. The cakes and pekoe were
reinforced by songs from the star guest and
tenor Victor Baxter, with Natalie Dawson
at the piano and some elocution from Bertha
Collin. Violet Concannon, who was called
across the Continent by Dame Nellie to play
small parts in grand opera, is tracking back
with- a feeling like that of the King of
France of the nursery-rhyme, and his famous
men who “drew their swords and put them
up again.” After rehearsing four or more
roles she was only once called on—at the
opening performance of “Faust,” in which
she earned much favorable comment as
Seibel. Victor Baxter, whom Russell en-
thused over, also found himself left behind
when the co. moved over to Sydney.
An £BO cheque goes to the Alfred Hospital
from the crowded variety entertainment
launched by Mrs. James Angus in the Frail
ran Town Hall on Thursday night. The
hundreds who were turned away from the
booking-office will get another chance to see,
the show;, as it is to be re-staged at an early
date. A group of medical- students, led by
Archie Aitken with some bright assistance
from Jack Barry Thompson, were the main
stay of the programme.
The Mermaid Repertories fdled the Flay-
house on Thursday night for their first
production of Milne’s “Dover Road.” The
Best Known were heavily sprinkled about
the stalls and circle. Artist George Bell’s
attractive wife, as leading lady in the Milne
play, aired a succession* of fine sartorial
effects, beginning with a biscuit-colored coat-
frock furred on the collar , and pocket flaps
with squirrel, aud a dinky little hat of black
velvet bandaged with henna tissue carrying
a silvery glow. From this she switched over
to a brown cloth sandwiching side widths of
brown and gold, patterned like a draught-
board. Dusky waves of shimmering crepe
surging together on the port side to an
anchorage of brilliants provided the princi-
pal dress thrill; and she took her last cur-
tain in navy tailorings.
Sir Aurelian Ridsdale, according to a letter
from his brother, Dr. Arthur Ridsdale, died
of cancer of the stomach in England a few
weeks back. He was chairman of the British
Red Cross Association in England during
and after the war, and came to Australia a
little over a year ago, principally to visit
Tasmania, where he had land. A sister is
married to Stanley Baldwin, lately Primin-
ister of England. Arthur Ridsdale is well
known in Sydney, which he often visits on
his journeyings round the world. Malaria
nearly claimed him in the Gilbert and Ellice
group, where he was engaged with Dr. Frank
O’Connor in tropical-disease research a year
or two ago.
, There, was a warm greeting for Charles
Hackett when lie started his season at the
Town Hall last week. State Excellency
Stradbroke, a slim daughter and a boyish
aide tried to fill three of the four fat chairs
reserved for vice-royalty, but something went
amiss with the arrangements for their en-
trance, for they had started bowing to the
fluttered congregation before pianist Clarence
Raybould could dash to the piano to lower
them into their seats with a few bars of Gor-
save. Hackett and his small fiddler, Bratza,
captured the ear of the populace from then-
first numbers, but the cartwheel of laurel-
leaves handed up to the tenor was not a
more earnest token of approval than the
“Bravo!” that frequently assailed the young-
ster. In fact, he gave as many encores as
his senior, the multitude developing an in-
satiable hunger for some of his prettily-
embroidered airs.
Those who saw' Kitty Reidy’s golden head
in the second row of chairs at Charles llae-
kett’s first concert in Melbourne wondered
what had Whirled her into the Happiness of
an evening off. It transpired presently that
the Australian girl had had some w r ords
with the management concerning her part
in “The Lady of the Rose,” presently to
burst into bloom, and, failing to get satisfac-
tion, had granted herself a holiday. The
worst of such incidents is that the other
party is sometimes willing to let you take
a longer holiday than you really want.
Mrs. W. M. Robins had a party at her
Hawthorn place the other day to bid <iu
revolt' to her particular pal, the Tallis lady,
who, with daughter Biddy, is about to cross
to Sydney to join her husband and second
son, and start out on a year’s trot around
the globe. Mrs. Saddler Gill came armed
with twin posies, one for the hostess and
another for the star guest, and the occasion
was gladdened by song items from Elsie
Dickenson and Phyllis Thomas and fiddle
solos by Avis Morcomb. After cups had
been downed, Mrs. Robins arose and hurled
a verbal bouquet at the parting guest, which
the latter briefly acknowledged after she
had been acclaimed “a jolly good fellow”
by the whole roomful.
Singer Charles Hacketf was called in to
the Artists’ Galleries on Friday night, and at
the hands of president Thomas Brentnall
received the blessings of the Music Club.
The tenor was under convoy of his wife,
opulently enveloped in ermine above misty
blackness. All the lights had turned up to
meet the pair, and everyone was fed on
cakes and coffee before the taxis headed
homeward.
This Broothoi*n-made picture introduces
you to Mrs. James Gatehouse, who, though she
has held the golf championship for some time
is still very popular in gawting circles —she is
President of
A s sociates,
Itoyal Mel-
bourne Club.
She was a
Geelong Aus-
tin, and most
members of
that woolly
Western Dis-
trict clan are
keen on some
form or other
of sport. In
fact, another
of the tribe,
Mr s. Bowie,
threatened to
rival her
champion
cousin before
she packed
her clubs to
accompany her
husb and to
London, where
he manages for the Goldsbrough firm. But
Mrs. Gatehouse by no means gives all her
attention to the game. A husband aud small
son demand much of it. and then as presi-
dent of the Sandringham branch of the
Women’s National League a good slice of her
time is taken up with local politics, while an
ever-growing share is devoted to her activi-
ties as president of the Society for the Pre-
vention of Cruelty to Children.
At the J.C.W. firm’s plunge into vaude-
ville at the Royal on Saturday, none of the
stars threw in any striking dress features,
though one or two achieved some arresting
undress effects. In the dance turn by
Solanges and .Tulls the lady evidenced the
charm of the full skirtings of great-grand-
mamma’s-day, in yards of white flounces with
red roses poised on the hip and shoulder. Alice
Lloyd, sister of Marie, came on in crino-
lined flounces of glowing pink and mauve,
topped with a tight jacket of the latter
shade, and a little shepherdess hat in the
same colorings. After a couple of other
changes she aired a ravishing geranium-
tinted silk shawl, veiling tricky pink bath-
ing togs, and had her golden head bound

in white fur coat, inhabited the right-hand
pen with her attendants, and the Charles
Taits were boxed below, while the Mayoral
Bruntoiis viewed the scene from opposite.
The age of the now-defunct Robertson
Moffat firm was demonstrated at a smoke
night recently held by its late employees.
One of the relics of the big rag-shop's early
days, in responding to a 'toast, admitted
nearly 60 years’ service, and became reminis-
cent on the subject of the late W. T. Moffat.
“I remember,” he said, “the foresight lie
showed at the outbreak of the American civil
war” —the old chap said it as casually as if
it had been the Boer War —“when Mr. Moffat
bought every piece of calico he could find in
Melbourne. Later the Lancashire mills shut
down through lack of supplies from America,
and the firm sold the goods back to the Lane
houses which had supplied them—and had
laughed at his madness —at many times the
original price.” Few of the old hands chose
to remain long after the house was absorbed
by the overwhelming Bourke-street firm.
A few lines from Adelaide
Over £630 was cleared at the Children’s Hospi-
tal Ball, and the matrons responsible for the frivol
put their hands into their own parses to meet the
expenses. The street collection in aid of the same
fund netted nearly £6OO, and the expenses for
that were £4. House-to-house collectors are now
at work in the suburbs, and it looks as though the
Government will be asked to pay its £1 per £1
subsidy up to the full £lO,OOO asked for. ;
The French Government has made Alderman Fran!;
Moulden an Officier d’Aoademie. He has been Con 1
sul here for some time, and he and his wife are
great workers for any money-raising scheme for
France that comes along.
Kooyonga, our new golf club, had its 18-hole
course opened by the Governor the other day. It is
only about two years since the scheme was mooted,
but already £20,000 has gone in improvements,
there is a membership of over 300, and further im-
provements are already planned. About 90 per cent,
of the scheme’s success is due to the club’s captain,
Herbert Bymill, who is a kind of godfather to golf
in this State.
Adelaide is patting itself on the* back again over
the two Fantin Latour flower pieces in its Art
Gallery, bought in 1899 and 1908 for 75 guineas
each. About a dozen similar things have just come
under the hammer at Christie’s in London; hardly
any went under 1000 guineas, and for three of the
best one buyer gave 6900 guineas.

Had Halida won the G. N. Hurdle, his
nigger-owner would have collected anything from
£5OOO to £30,000 in bets. The estimates are
those ot horse-reporters in whom big punters invari-
ably confide, knowing that the news will be broken
gently to the income-tax commissioners. The brown
(6 to 4 at the death-knock) made a great effort
to enrich Coleman, but, clouting the second last
obstacle with some force, he failed by a length and
a half to reach Jackstaff (15’s), and was being
overtaken at the finish by Groganite (16’s), whose
late run, under punishment, was- impressive. After
Chrysostom and Loja had made the running for a
mile and three-quarters, Glennon took Jackstaff to
the front, and the lead then established he never
lost. The winner, who carried list. 51b., a weight
rarely exceeded in National Hurdles, has been an
excellent investment for H. E. Connelly, his owner-
trainer. There was little public money for him,
and the stable commission was small, but the Tyn-
Corteen-Godby-Cairns alliance deprived McShortodds
of some of his profits by landing a double with
Irish Rhythm—a fine stamp of a Eudorus colt that
showed promising form at Randwick in September
—and Coolah, another three-year-old, by Cooltrim-
Eulita.
The new handicapper was on good terms with
himself when Irish Rufus and Tarmoola ran a dead
heat in the Kensington Steeple after entering the
straight on terms. Tarmoola will get a 31b. con-
cession when the pair
meet again in the G. N.
Steeple, but Haoma will
carry this page’s con-
fidence in addition to
12st. 4lb. It is a big
burden to lift over
three miles of Fleming-
ton timber, but the
South Australian is
built on sturdy lines,
and his jumping is
superb. The Chrysos-
tom people showed poor
judgment in running
their neddy in Jack-
staff’s race. He may
win the steeple, but he
is just as likely to
break his neck.

SHAM, a success-

trainer.
Hitherto the Buckwheats have been re-
garded as sprinters, but Buckra (6’s) showed stamina
in winning the 12-furlongs Warwick Handicap at
Randwick on Saturday. True he was receiving 311 b.
from the Queenslander Royal Howard, who ran one
of his erratic races, but the manner in which he
ran past Bungarly and Houdini suggested that
another stone wouldn’t have troubled him. Two
other winners at Randwick were Encre,- a four-
year-old half-sister to David, and Sea Risk, a
brother to Purser and Note. Although each had
shown encouraging recent form Encre went out at
10 to 1 and Purser’s relative at 12’s. It was an-
other good day for McShortodds.

“The Deacon”: Jack Higgins, the new
chairman of stipendiary stewards at Sydney regis-
tered courses, is proving a thorn in the sides of the
unregenerate in more ways than one. Having a
clear morning or two lately, with no ramps to be
investigated, he did a surprise round of the suburban
training stables. What he saw in several instances
pleased him not at all. One successful trainer was
pertinently asked to explain how it was that his boys
were occupying a stall between the feed-room and
the horse-boxes, and striving to keep out the freezing
cold with Wagga rugs (i.e., cornbags sewn together
and lined with chaifbags)—this while there was
ample accommodation in his house.

“Tel” (Shanghai) : The biggest tote divi-
dend I ever heard of was paid out on Feb. 8 after
the New Year Stakes, a mile race for Manchurian
ponies, at liiangwan, Shanghai. There were only
two tickets at five dollars (11s. Bd. in English
money) on the winner, and each holder collected
5/30.70 dollars (£668 11s. 7d.). One of them,
an English police inspector, bought a few 10-doliar
tickets in a cash sweep, drawn the same afternoon,
and bagged the first prize, £9089 10s. Splendid
force, the police!

“Rita”: Adelaide sporting scribes certainly
work hard for their money. From my morning paper
1 learn that although numerous horses galloped six
furlongs yesterday morning, no two did it in the
same manner. . One steed “covered six furlongs”:
another “left six behind” ; others “easily accounted
for six, ’ “did six,” “ran six” ; “strode... .bowled
• .•.- dashed... .spurted... .spun... .worked .... trav-
elled.... and went strongly over six.” Others, again,
executed,” “contributed,” “negotiated” or were
‘ responsible for” the blessed numeral. Yes, the
game requires brains.

Muswellbrook beat Cressbrook in the final
round of the Dudley Cup on Saturday—a victory for
combined excellence over individual brilliance. The
N. S. Wales men have been playing together for about
15 years, and what they and their admirable ponies
rm k now about the game is hardly worth learning.
The Queenslanders, who were favorites when they
came on to the field—partly as holders of the ’23 Cun
and partly on their form—looked like having a run-
away win till the end of the second chukka. At that
t'me the score was. two goals to nil in their favor
and they seemed incapable of making a mistake.
Afterwards the luck veered; meritorious Cressbrook
shots hit the goal-posts; and above all the Muswell-
brook team got going. Working together like a
machine, and hitting and hooking with precision, the
eventual winners fairly dominated the game, and f.t
the finish the scores stood: Muswellbrook, 6 goals 8
behmds; Cressbrook, 3 goals 6 behinds. The teams
were not so far apart as this result suggests, but
the better won on the day.
Jacky Roo”: If I’m not mistaken, Australia
possesses the only one-armed polo-player in the
world. He is O. Winter-Irving. from Melbourne, and
/u a rattling srame despite his affliction. In
the Dudley Cup tournament he did sterling deeds
with the polo stick for the Wanderers. His bridle-
fS lns t. are attached to the stump of his arm, and
though riding strange ponies while in Sydney he
always seemed to have wonderful control of his
mounts. Incidentally, he suffered a nasty spill while
playing against the Cromarty team.

“Saaedi”: One reason for the popularity of
two-up is its comparative fairness. In most other
gambles there are endless opportunities for swindling
(tins is particularly true of horse-racing and
pony-flogging), but in two-up very simple precau-
tions will ensure a fair game between gentlemen,

The Olympic Games began inauspiciously
tor the Australians. A week ago it looked as if
blip Carr would be exceedingly dangerous in the
sprints, so well was he travelling on the track, but
unfortunately Carr strained a tendon in one of his
thighs and competed in the 100 metres against
doctor s orders. He ran in bandages. In the cir-
cumstances he did very well to reach the semi-
hnals. The vdtimate winner was Abrahams, the
Englishman, who beat Carr bv a vard in his heat
Second to Abrahams was Scholz; the third man was
Porritt, the Maorilander; and Paddock, who took
the honors for America at Antwerp in 1920, brought
up the rear. On Porritt’s showing Carr would
have fought out the finish with Abrahams but for
“’ s accident; he has equalled the Briton’s time,
10 3-ssec. Australia’s hopes now centre about
Charlton; Eve, the diver; the Murray Bridge crew •
and Winter, the hop-step-and-jump man.
* * * *
“Venturino”: Donald J. R. Sumner, who
won the pole-jump (10ft.) at Stamford Bridge for
Oxford Dm., is a Mount Torrens fS.A.) boy At 13
he gained a scholarship at the Adelaide High School
and that led to a medical bursary and the “Rhodes.”
He was school champion at tennis, and was in the
Adelaide Uni. lacrosse team. In spite of his academic
and sporting successes Don wasn’t too proud to help
the elder Sumner during vacations by driving a
motor bread-van.

“Gobble G.”: Clarrie Grimmett, Victoria’s
best slow bowler, is again packing up, this time for
Sturt (S.A.). He began his cricket in Maoriland,
but soon migrated to N.S.W., where, in 1915, he
shared with Arthur Mailey the season’s record for
most wickets in a match—i 4 for 115. In Victoria he
played for Stoush Melbourne before becoming with
Prahran the most consistent and destructive bowler
in the State. Week after week and year after year
Grimmett led the pennant averages, yet he was never
properly tried in big games. True, he was given
six overs against N. S. Wales in 1918; and against
the Englishmen in 1920 he got only 1 for 104 ; but
that was a match in which but three English wickets
fell (Patsy Hendren made 271 and Douglas 133 n. 0.),
so the average wasn’t bad for the day. Clarrie was
not tried again until the last inter-State match last
year, when, with the Shield won, several of the
regulars refused the trip to South Oss. With no
assistance from the wicket he took 1 for 12 and
8. for 86. Now Grimmett is going to a State where
his talent will be better appreciated.

The Rugby Union code got a great lift
when N. S. Wales defeated the All Blacks in the
fastest and cleanest representative match Sydney
has witnessed for many a day. Thirty thousand spec-
tators cheered the Ma Staters on to a 20—16 vic-
tory, and there would have been 10,000 more at
least had the Cricket Ground been the venue instead
of the less capacious and less comfortable ■Show Ground.
The professional League has a winter monopoly of the
Cricket Ground —-a monopoly which should never be
renewed. Brilliant features of a game that was
strenuous always, but never unsportsmanlike, were
Crossman’s try for N. S. Wales—getting a neat pass,
the Randwick winger broke even time for 25 yards
and dived, with Nepia inches away—and the passing
which enabled Masters to score for the visitors just
before time. The Blacks handled patchily and
crowded the wingers too close to the line. However,
Cooke, Badely (five-eighths). Brown and Lucas
(three-quarters) showed splendid form, and Munro, the
Brownlies and Richardson were conspicuous among
the forwards, who recalled a charge of cavalry when
they got going. Nepia, the full-back, is a sure
mark and kick, but too often he failed to gain
ground before booting the ball. In that respect he
O. C. CROSSMAN, who scored a fine try
against the All Blacks.
suffered by compari-
son with the fair-
haired Nothling, who,
deputising for Toby at
the last moment,
played the game of his
young life. The Blue
scrummagers were all
good, and in line-work
were superior to the
M.L. six-footers. Davis,
Thom and Greatorex
(always prominent in
the pack), Walker
(half), Stanley and
Wogan (three-
quarters) were
factors in a
success which
was full of
merit.
“Centurion”; In my judgment, H. W. Brown, the
laranalci centre-three, was the outstanding member
ot the All Blacks. He is a racing centre who very
much recalls Prank Mitchinson with his dashing
straight running, though he is lighter than the
famous Wellington centre. He is only 19. C. G.
Porter the Wellington wing forward, put up some-
thing like a record for a first match in Australia,
inasmuch as no barraeker audibly thirsted for his
blood. With vivid memories of M.L. wingers, from
“Offside” Mackenzie to Beilis, this is a thing to
marvel at. Poor Dave Gallagher, dead in France
roused such a frenzy in Britain by his methods as
wing forward in 1905 that the expulsion of Maori-
land from the Empiah was discussed in exclusive
circles. The present side shows no arresting foot-
ball personalities to compare with W. J. Wallace,
George Smith, Fred Roberts or E. Booth among the
J 905 backs, or Seeling, Glasgow and Casey among
the forwards. The most attractive section of the
Black team on Saturday was the threequarter line
when it found its feet in the second half. Forward,
the side was irresistible in the rucking and loose
rushes, but that failure to take the ball cleanly
which often marks a new combination caused the
game to go against them at the finish. The Welsh-
men ow'ed much to their clean hooking in the first
term and to Stanley’s exceptionally good work as out-
side centre. The invaders were finishing much
better than our XV, and I tip them to win the
rubber.
“Machete”: The Maorilanders can certainly boast
an amazing Rugby record (B. 3/7/’24). Not count-
ing their Service team in Europe and South Africa in
1919-20, the All Blacks have, in the course of 40
years, played 151 matches against Australian,
British, French, S’African, American and English
teams. Of these they have won 133, lost 13 and
drawn 5. There is consistency, if you like.
* * * *
“Centurion”: Larry Wogan. the stocky
centre-threequarter of the N. S. Wales side against
the All Blacks, has played close on 60 representa-
tive games since he went to California in 1912 with
the Waratahs. In his day he was one of the greatest
centies Australia has produced, and this season he
has been playing* at his top. Wogan*s record must
be unique, Even m England, which now plays four
internationals a season, they have been making a
fuss over c. N. Lowe’s tally of 20 “caps.”
* * * *
“Lexite”: A Sydney League footballer,
noted for his artistic shinning and elbow-work in
the scrums, was ordered a few weeks’ holiday, for
which a referee was mainlv responsible, and decided
to spend it in a Blue Mountain boarding-house. Tht
dear old ladies, his hostesses, must have had a
feeling that the life of their establishment was dull
for such a celebrity; in fact, they said so. “But,”
remarked one of them, hopefully, “the young people
will be home at the week-end, and then things will
be bettah. They have such wonderful games. Which
pastime do you prefer, Mr. Shinki’ck—ping-pong or
roundahs ?”
* * * *
“Bill R.”: The Courtneys, of Western
Suburbs, are not the onlv father and son who are
playing Rugby League football in the same team.
Arthur Winter and his son Milton—uncle and cousin
of the Olympic hop-step-and-jumper—have belonged to
the Bungendore (N.S.W.I XIII for three seasons.
Arthur, a forward, owns up to 45, and Milton,
a winger, is 22.
* * * *
“Harold Hardupp”: The most earnest on-
looker at the Sydney League game in which South
Sydney obliterated Easts was an individual who
introduced himself to the crowd with a yell of
“Kick ’im in the stommiek, Oxford!” Thereafter
he adjured sundry Eastern players, but particularly
“Bluey” Watkins, whom he appeared to admire as
one who could stoush the universe, to “Plug ’im in
the nose,” “Bite ’is ear off,” “Put ther boot in,” or
commit other unkindnesses upon bodies clothed in
the red-nnd-e-reen jerseys. At half-time, when his
frenzy subsided for a while, an elderly spectator
remonstrated with him upon his unsportsmanlike
exhortations. “I wouldn’t care if it was anv

The Melbourne football season has
advanced so far that one can safely forecast Sou h
Melbourne, Essendon or Fitzroy as ultimate nil
miers, with a shade of odds on South. On Saturday
the red-and-whites downed ’Roy by 64 points to it -
Essendon ended with 79 points to Carlton’s 62 • Rich
mond walloped Geelong after a great struggle in
which force played a larger part than skill ran t
62), and St. Ivilda gave ’Wood another drubbing
(112 to 52). Whatever the cause there is obvious
dissension in ’Wood’s ranks.
“Wink”: Another case of money in football The
day after Keith Miller, an 18-year-old star signed
up with Richmond, the Footscray Association eluh
offered the youth £6O cash by way of opening neeo
tiations. How high the club was prepared to sro m
salary and “spiffs” is not known, for the initial hid
was refused.
Several Vie. Association clubs are Irvins' their
darnedest to become the tenth club in the Leasue
The evening papers are taking referendums as to which
should be admitted, and P’ran council has risen in
white heat to demand P’ran’s admission—P’ran heiny
the most incompetent of the 10 Ass. teams At
which everybody smiles. The League has ’ lately
thrown hungry glances on the new motor-racing track-
on Yarra Bank, a saucer which is served by an
electric tram, is within easy walking distance of the
city, can accommodate 70,000 spectators, and could
be made to accommodate 100,000. The around
lessees, who can’t run motor races every Saturday
would like to see huge football crowds there especi-
ally in the finals, and the League badlv wants to
keep anyone else out of that ground. For all these
reasons there is a movement to start a Public Service
F. C., and as this could draw on many star players
in other clubs, without cutting into the districts
these now monopolise, the movement promises to be
successful.

The Wimbledon tennis tournament was
full of surprises this year. Following on Brookes’s
victory over the American crack, Hunter, came Ray-
mond’s win in three sets over another burly Yankee
Watson Washburn. The last-named, who came to
Australia with Tilden and Johnston after the Davis
Cup success in Auckland over four years ago is
generally classed as a doubles expert, but he plays a
fine singles game too; so Raymond’s achievement of
beating the experienced warrior in three chapters
the last of which was carried to 17—15, is some-
thing to blow about But the sensation of the
meeting was the punishment inflicted on Vincent
Richards by the young Frenchman, Jean Borotra
This youth, who is by birth a Basque, was reckoned
too jumpy to face the Australians in the U.S.A. last
year, nor was he among the early favorites at
Wimbledon, yet his figures against Richards were
B—4, 4 —6, 6 —o, 6—3, which amounts to a
majority of nine games in a four-set battle. Borotra
overcame Richards by his terrific pace, which kept
that young man from hugging the net for his
favorite volleying game. By knocking out Raymond
Borotra became eligible for the final with his coun-
tryman, Lacoste, who had added to the depression
across the Atlantic by accounting for Norris Wil-
liams in three 6ets to one, and the Basque won a
five-set duel in which speed was the deciding factor.
Earlier in the tournament Lacoste badly hammered
the much-fancied Jap, Okamoto, and got the verdict
against the Spaniard, Manoel Alonzo. All which
suggests that France has a great chance of reaching
the Davis Cup challenge round, more especially as
Patterson and O’Hara Wood are losing with depress-
ing regularity to Yanks who are not in the same
class as Tilden and Johnston.
* * * *
After five years the ladies’ singles cham-
pionship at Wimbledon has been recovered for
Britain by Kitty McKane. It must have been a
remarkable struggle when the Englishwoman, with
one set to the bad and a leeway of I—4 to make
up in the second against such an opponent as Helen
Wills, doggedly wiped off the deficit by taking five
games in a row, and followed up this feat by captur-
ing the decisive set at 6—4. Probably Miss McKane’s
experience and pluck were superior to the American
girl’s, but she also had the* emotional impetus of
bringing off an almost unprecedented recovery be-
fore some thousands of her cheering countrymen.
Kitty McKane well deserved her win, and American
critics like Vincent Richards cannot claim that their
little champion wasn’t acclimatised. Her figures up
to the turn of the tide showed that she was well on
her game.
* * * *
“H.S.”: Norman Brookes’s sudden decision
on Monday to call up the Old Guard, in the person
of himself, for the assault on the Davis Cup, sug-
gests the impression his performances at Wimbledon
have made on his imagination. Also, possibly, the
effect on it of the performances of the Frenchmen.
He is a first-flighter still—on his day. But nis
health is poorer than ever; bis eyesight is failing,
and he is 46. For a long time past he has oniy
been playing mild Sunday tennis in Melbourne. The
odds against another blaze up of form such as lie
showed last month appear tremendous. Neither
Borotra nor Lacoste is an authentic champion, but
they are young, steady and improving. On their
Wimbledon form they might very well down Patter-
son and Wood in America. But eoidd either of them
beat Patterson in the singles and then win the doubles
against a Brookes-Patterson or Wood-Brookes com-
bination? Brookes evidently thinks not —always
assuming he can recapture the skill and staying
power that were his a few weeks ago. In any event
liis decision to go to the U.S. is a matter for rejoic-
ing in Australia. He is not likely to select himself
unless satisfied that he is at his top; and his trip
will cost the Tennis Assoc, nothing, since he is rich
enough to be able to pay for his indulgences.
For nine or ten rounds Tommy Uren,
now in the veteran stage, boxed beautifully at the
Sydney Stadium against the English-born Newcastle
welter, Collins, who is a slow beginner. Then the
younger man took charge, and Thomas was soon in a sad
plight. In the 11th round he stopped an awful smash
with his left eye. In the 15th he was floored by
a snappy left to the temple—a wicked place to take
a punch. The old ’un tried hard to regain his feet,
but he was still down when “Out” was sounded. As
kindly hands bore him away he was heard to murmur
that he would apply his 25 p.c. of the “house”
( £714) to the purchase of bees and silver wyandottes
for his Penrith farm, from which never more would
he roam.
THEN AND NOW.
[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
athletes of 45 nations, representing the
gi eatest (sporting gathering in history, marched
iouna the arena of the great stadium at Paris
Games » people gathered for the Olympic
Ihe world has seen its twenty-seventh cent’ry
Go drifting, so to speak, adown the sluice
Since Hellene stewards took the primal entry
For sports in honor of Olympian Zeus,
And teams of iron-thewed and hefty gentry
At various trials of skill and strength cut loose
To make their bid for the supreme renown
Inseparable from an olive crown.
They leaped, be sure, and wrestled, boxed and
sprinted,
liundled the bowl and heaved through air the
stone.
(No fault of theirs there were no programmes
printed)
The javelin was hurled, the discus thrown.
They may have skipped. ’Tis doubtful if they
shintied;
That pleasant sport can hardly have been known.
And in those golden years, that glowing clime,
For lack of watches none could take the time.
Still, ’twas the genuine parent of athletic
Meetings. ’Twas Greece that gave us dance and
song,
Accomplishments pictorial and poetic,
Bacchus and his exhilarating throng,
And Lesbian Sappho with the charm magnetic,
Author of verse which wowsers reckon wrong—
The home of all the arts she was, in short,
And at Olympia first she mothered sport.
It seems a decent stretch in rolling ages
From sev’n-sev’n-six b.c. on Elis’ plain
To the Olympiad that now engages
The pick of all the nations by the Seine.
But hats are in the ring once more, and gages
Go down, and runners sweat and pant and strain.
Yet not for parsley wreaths to deck the brow,
ho records would be cut for greenstuff now.

THE INKY WAY.
When J. J. Hall, the newspaper man of the Vie.
Jocky party, went up to Benambra to try to capture
the Assembly seat from Hon. Minister Beardmore he
knew he was on a forlorn hope. Beardmore (who,
by the way, owns eignt sons and half a dozen daugh-
ters) licked the carpet-bagger, as he called Hall,
by three to one.
“Coot”: Inkywayfarers who have been complaining
of the lack of preference for home-made serials in
the Australian daily press can exempt one capital
city from their strictures. Every Melbourne daily,
morning and evening, is just now publishing a
serial by a local writer.
“Macquarie Street”: Tested by the number of
translations of his books into French, Conrad is fast
overhauling in popularity Galsworthy and Arnold
Bennett, the most Gallicized of all English authors.
Four of his novels have already appeared in French
dress, viz., “Almayer’s Folly,” “Lord Jim,” “Under
Western Eyes” and “Within the Tides”; the next
will be “Victory.”
“The Deacon”: The N.S.W. South Coast lost one
of its best-known identities when William Boot died
at Moruya. the other day. The son of a pioneer
medico of the late ’forties, he began life as a bank
clerk, but soon deserted finance for journalism, and
after some years’ apprenticeship launched out as the
proprietor of the Bega Budget. As a side-line he
made several unsuccessful attempts to get into Par-
liament. He was past the allotted span when he
signed the Book.
“Sturt”: Adelaide Herald, which started in
1910 and was for some years the only Labor daily
in Australia, has given up the struggle at last. F.
F. Ward, chairman of the Board of management, talks
at' the result as lamentable but inevitable: “Great
financial difficulties started with far too small an
amount of capital... .We have been denied many
advertisements on account of our policy.... Had
assistance at periods from unions, but not for some
time now The Board has accomplished a miracle,
almost, in maintaining the paper so long.” So, just
as a Labor Ministry arrives in office, what should be
its journalistic mouthpiece gives up the ghost.
“S.S.”: A story is told of a drunken reporter, dis-
missed from the Age staff, who found his way into
the upstair office of David Syme, and, becoming
rather insolent, was ordered out. He ignored the
direction and went on with his tale of woe, telling
David what he thought of the family of Syme, past,
present and to come. “If you don’t get out 111
throw vou from the window,” said brawny Syme.
“You’lf throw me from the window?” echoed the
contumacious one. “Yes, I will.” “That window;?
“Yes, that window —the first window from the
right.” David made an aggressive movement. It
you’ll excuse me,” said the reporter, “I would much
rather walk downstairs.” And he walked.
“Lex” • The publisher of the South Western
Times (W.A.) has been fined £5O, and ordered to be
imprisoned till payment is made, for an article on
the O’Neil murder. But a dozen articles of the
sort that Australia’s ghoul-press has taken to featur-
ing everv time a hideous assassination is perpetrated
are likelv to be less damaging to the accused than
the Coroner’s-inquest reports which appear in the
most reputable papers, and which must go on
appearing till Parliament decides to the contrary.
No good purpose is served by the broadcasting of
the roving commission undertaken by coroners, in
the course of which unfortunates who turn out to
have had no connection whatever with the crime are
often implicated: to allow such investigations to be
reported, while deprecating later allusions, is a
marked case of swallowing a camel and straining
at a gnat.
“Ex-Englishman”: “S.T.S.” is not likely to find
safety in calling his imaginary character Nebuchad-
nezzar Bulwiggle (B. 29/5/’24). He’d better stick
to Jones and split up the risk, so to speak. To
concentrate is to avoid trouble for a good while and
then strike it hard. Pinero thought he was safe in
inventing- an unlikely Mrs. Ebbsmith to be Notorious;
but a real live person of that name turned up and
made things unileasant for him. The worst luck was
that of the London journalist who commented on
the behavior of Englishmen abroad, instancing an
imaginary K.C. and churchwarden, Columbus Copper,
of Clapham (that was not. it, but it was something
equally unlikely), who while on a. visit to Paris
had behaved in a quite unehurchwardenly way. And
promptly there came from Lancashire a libel action by
a churchwarden of that precise name. True, he was
not a K.C., and he did not live at Clapham ; but he
argued successfully that the slight change looked
like mere camouflage, and that all his neighbors had
no doubt whatever that he was the hypocrite.
“H.J.T.”: The American advocacy of Thomas
Hardy’s claims on the Nobel Prize for Literature is
an example of the occasional great generosity of the
Yankees ‘toward British literary men. When Carlyle
was more than ordinarily hard up, and not a penny
had been realised by him in his own country for his
“French Revolution,” American money for the book
poured in and was hailed by the old man as sent
almost by miracle.” Bitterly he contrasted English
results “Above a thousand pounds has been gathered
from England from that book,” wrote the angry
Tammas, “but none seems to belong to the writer,
it all belongs to other people —the sharks! Visit-
ing Americans might pester him with their inquisitive
intrusions, but he was pathetically grateful to the
nation “One prays that the blessing of Hun that
was rather ill off may be with them, these good
friends ” Dickens had so caricatured Americans that
it was" considered unwise for him to make a second
visit But he was received with unstinted cordiality,
and is said to have netted £30,000 from his lecturing
and reading tour —an immense sum for those days.
Also it was the Americans who actually enabled
London to enjoy Henry Irving; for Irving has left
it on record that “if it had not been for the un-
stinted generosity of the American public in my
support I could not have maintained my theatre in
London as I have done.” Yet American publishers
were unblushing and unscrupulous thieves of novels
and other literature so long as there was no copyright
law to deter them, and many a play that had been
a success in England or France was. scoffed at for
stale stuff when produced in the States, pirates having
already done it to death there.
HEDIVIVUS.
[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
To-day I took old rhymes that I had written,
And read them through, each one unto the end ;
When with a swift nostalgia was I smitten,
As with sad memories of some old friend —
Some happy, wayward man I used to know
Long since. Alas ! (And, by the way, heigh-ho ! )
All his, it seemed, these sudden, cheerful spasms
Of humor poured from an untroubled mind,
These old ambitions, old enthusiasms,
When all the world seemed true, and men most
kind ;
When roseate skies were never tinged with grey.
Ah woe! (And, so to speak, alack-a-day!)
All his these views so unsophisticated,
These thoughts so innocent and yet so wise.
Such min is as mine have never contemplated
A world so free of guile, so free of lies,
A world of woe and wickedness so free.
Oh misery! (And, as it were, ah me!)
Not mine this intricate, yet careless weaving
Of joyous rhymes? Not mine this happy twist?
Surely not mine ? ’Tis far beyond believing!
Such songs came from some youthful optimist
Who gaily danced along life’s primrose way.
And yet- (Well, once again, alack-a-day!)
Yet they are mine, these merry, lilting phrases.
Never again shall I pen such sweet lays!
Never again shall I....But why the blazes
Shouldn’t I? (Odds fish! and spare me days!)
Why shouldn’t I ? The time is surely ripe
For verses far surpassing this old tripe!

In a week of repetitions “The Barber”
sparkled at Sydney Majesty’s on Thursday
night. Rossini’s score is brimful of delicate
charm, and is as indestructible as the spirit of
youth in which it was conceived. From the
first wave of Paolantonio’s baton the over-
ture w r as a winner, and the dainty aperitif
was drained with obvious delight. Later,
when the curtains drew back on the action
of the play, the gaiety and frank enjoy-
ment of the company were worthy accom-
paniment to the sparkling cascade of melody.
Toti dal Monte, looking like an alluring
though very plump doll in her old-time
Spanish frocking, bubbled over as the much-
sought Rosina. The part just fitted her win-
someness and merry eyes. As for her
singing, it was a whole family of canaries
in the morning sun. Such roulades and
trills —it was a spring morning broidered and
prinked by Nature in most decorative fashion ;
it was sweetness through and through; in
the singing lesson where her choice fell upon
the old “Carnival of Venice,” with variations,
it wms a very rapture of sound. Dino Bor-
gioli, singing from a recovered throat, was
more fluent and pleasing than heretofore; in
the serenade he made a fine figure of a Senti-
mental Bloke, and later showed a happily
humorous mood. Grandini was bustling, im-
portant and gay as Figaro, and took his ever-
green numbers at the right whirlwind pace.
Di Lelio, in a wondrous make-up, made
Basilio a melodious and likeable rogue. But
Azzolini was the surprise-packet of the even-
ing. He was a fine figure of fun as Bartolo.
Another happy event w T as the opening male
chorus.

“Good Morning, Dearie,” the new’ musical
comedy at Sydney Royal, is not likely tr out-
rival “Sally.” It resembles that play inas-
much as Josie Melville has the part of a
“CARMEN,” AT SYDNEY MAJESTY'S.
Don Jose (Nino Piccaluga) being vamped
by Carmen (Aga Lahoska).
pore American working-girl who marries
into the aristocracy—English on this occa-
sion—but the music is not so attractive;
moreover, the supply of American slang,
prohibition jokes and “crook” stuff is exces-
sive. This kind of humor has been overdone
in the pitchers, and Australians are losing
the taste for it in spoken plays. Miss Mel-
ville is at her winsome best in tender pass-
ages with George Yollaire, but she has few
opportunities to score compared with those
which “Sally” afforded her. Vollaire, a young
Englishman with a fetching smile and a
pleasant- speaking voice (his light baritone
is also tolerable, though doubtfully worth
writing to London about), justifies his im-
portation. Two other clever newcomers are
George Crotty and Percy Le Fre, dancing
comedians both. Crotty has a weakness for
shouting his lines, but it is an amiable weak-
ness perhaps; Le Fre’s methods are quieter,
and his eccentric dance is a gem. Dan Agar
helps the interesting pair when help is
needed. Rosemary Rees makes an arresting
figure of a sentimental costumier whose.
French was learned in the Bowery; and
Thelma Burness, as an English girl engaged
in acquiring American experience, is dainty
and appealing. (This young woman is stead-
ily qualifying for a leading part.) But the
outstanding feature of “Good Morning,
Dearie,” is the dancing. That of the Sun-
shine Girls—J6 shapely and lissome young
Australians—is extraordinarily good. Also,
Doran and Rivkin do an exhilarating apache
dance in a hall called Hell’s Bells, where
Linn Smith’s jazz band makes barbarous
noises.

At Sydney Opera House “Old Bill, M.P.,”
still pursues his chequered way.
sss ;]{ V
“Lilac Time,” the course of true love set
to the music of Schubert, will last only six
nights more at Sydney Cri.
There is nothing startling about Sydney
Tivoli’s latest reinforcements, and old hands
still claim most of the applause. The Moli-
naris, the best of the newcomers, bring grand
opera within reach of the. proletariat. Jock
McKay, a product of the Lauder school, was
born in 1880, the programme says, and it is
time his humor got a kick in it. Arthur
Prince and the hard-working Ruth Astor
maintain their previous good impressions.
Carter the Great is still working miracles
in the most matter-of-fact way at Sydney
Palace. And Evelyn Maxwell tears aside
the veil that hides the future as if it were
nothing more than butter-muslin.
“Lucretia Lombard,” at Sydney Lyceum,
has all the luck. First her husband, whose
vice is morphine, dies; then the wife of a
man who loves her terribly frizzles providen-
tally in a fire, making the track to the happy
ending all clear, “The Man Next Door”
centres in a dogfight that breaks up a placid
bridge-party. The Globe has “West of the
Water Tower,” a tirade against wowserism
and a vanning to young m.c.’s that it is as
v.i'U i-> puritanical burg to have your mar-
rue !>.'•; upon you. Golden-haired soprano
D; u s' .-ton, who sang with the R’go
Op t < uplifts her well-trained voice
daily ,ie same house. Hutchinsonians are
crowding to see the depressing “This Free-
dom” at Crystal Palace. “North of the
Yukon,” at the Lyric, introduces a marvel
who scraps with packs of wolves; and at
Hoyt’s “The Storm Daughter” is wild and
willing, and “The Temporary Husband” is
not as good as he ought to be. But, then,
what husband is?
** * *
“Neryda,” from the pen of Miss Weather-
ill, adds a bright if conventional romantic
opera to the credit of Australia. The story
is stereotyped, nor does the score rise to
heights of great originality; but some of the
lyrics are attractive, and the whole is tune-
ful, and can be effectively handled by ama-
teurs. So much was indicated by Saturday
night’s performance at the Conservatorium
when the Randwick and Waverley Musical
Societies staged it to a crowded house. Bari-
tone Harold Tollemache and Evelyn Willis
sustained most of the weight of the per-
formance: and the orchestra under, J. G.
Cocks was more than creditable.
A youthful Sydney show:—
The surprise of the exhibition of the Younger
Group of Australian artists, at Horderns’ Gallery,
is the big “Satyr” in bronzed plaster by Frank
Lynch, son of a Vic. stonemason, who spent his
youth in Maoriland, went to the war, and then
put in two years at the Polytechnic School of Art
in London. It is well conceived, surely modelled
and vital, and suggests that Lynch is definitely on
his way to some really notable work. In general the
show is mainly interesting for the freshness and vigor
of many of these younger artists. Though they may
not have turned out anything of real distinction,
their outlook is clear and their fingers are not
fumbling. The best craftsmanship is shown by
H. C. Gibbons in his portrait of a blonde in a
black dress —sincerely painted and effective work.
“Autumn Gold” catches the eye among Herbert R.
Gallop’s small landscapes, but his big “Canberra,”
though it achieves spaciousness, is jolty in its color
values. Of W. R. Johnson’s panels the most note-
worthy is the little, short-ranged “The Camp,” in
which shadow-flecked canvas amid the foliage is
admirably touched in. Grace Crowley has some
promising animal studies and a well-executed group
of turkeys. Norman Lloyd’s 18 oils strike an in-
sistent note on the western wall, and his overworked
blues and flattened foliage become monotonous. Still,
he has put some commendable work into “Port of
Newcastle,” though the coherence of the composition
is marred by the spottiness of its pattern. Fred
Finley gallantly essays a couple of grouped figure-
subjects, and in “The Smuggler’s Recruit” has
achieved an interesting result, though his draughts-
manship and technical equipment generally are un-
equal to the demands of such a task.
Two concerts at the Town Hall last week
apprised Melbourne of Charles Hackett’s
importance in the world of song. He owns
a tenor of great range and flexibility which
rapidly loses its Anglo-Saxon color in the
lyric Italian mood. He warbles such
voice-worn things as “Che Gelida M an in a"
(“Boh&me”) and “E Lucevan le Stelle”
f“Tosca”) as only an operatic performer
should, but it is in the rare legato work of
a number like Mozart’s “II Mio Tesoro”
from “Don Giovanni” that he stirs the pro-

fessors to tumult and proves the quality of
his education. Also in the lighter concert
items one is impressed with his skill. It is
a treat to hear him release the fragment of
sentiment imprisoned in Beethoven’s air of
“The Kiss” and then to have him swing
into the heroic manner and picture in John
Ireland’s delightful “Sea Fever” bellying
canvas and driving spray. Forceful or plain-
tive, voluptuously Italian or dropping into
the simplicity of a drawing-room ballad, he
is an artist of too wide and original an
achievement to be cheaply pigeonholed as
“the second Oartxso.” The dead Caruso, un-
approached as he was in his particular
vehicles, could never have attained Hackett’s
interpretative flights in purely English sing-
ing. Bratza, the violinist, excels in ~bijou
pieces in the twilight style, but his tone all
through is inviting, and he is noticeably free
from tricks. At his first concert he produced
some fine stiletto notes at the top of the
scale and romped through some dances like
a Slav possessed. Clarence Raybould, who
accompanies like an angel, might well be in-
vited to show his paces in some solo items.
Eight turns sufficed the Firm for its
modest dip into vaudeville at Melbourne
Royal on Saturday, and Bransby Williams
is the best of them. A Dickens interpreter
and a sound actor in other directions, he
requires something more than the ordinary
vaudeville attitude to appreciate his finer
points. Allied to his talent for mimicry is a
genius for achieving with wig and grease-
paint a strikingly acceptable likeness of the
eiiaracter lie is portraying. His Uriah
Heep, Dan’l Peggotty, and vivid burlesque
of an old-time showman are all artistically
convincing; in each he completely obliter-
ates himself. Alice Lloyd, the second star
on the bill, hasn’t the larky tone and insidi-
ous personal address of famous sister Marie,
nor are her ditties superlatively fascinating.
Couched in terms of Cockney humor, they
are conspicuous for the emphasis of certain
lines with a wink of raffish jollity. Cyril
Key is the paiixstaking nut of a duet with
Jenny Keyworth, who counter-attacks his
frivolity with heavier raillery of the average
music-hall patteni. Landry and Julls open
prettily in a dance act which works through
an Apache inteidude to an eccentric finale;
and one Louis is grotesque all through his
whimsical musical engagement with his smil-
ing partner Anna. Teddy Stream meanders
through well-known fields as a burlesque
comedian, and Ed. Marcel’s fallabout skat-
ing act shows all the characteristics of its
numerous relations. Victoria Carmen
warbles in a glittering outfit, but her only
remarkable feature is her superb self-confi-
dence. The orchestra, under the command of
Ernest Oram, leads, a quiet life.
After the sudden departure of Kitty Reidy
from the cast of “Whirled into Happiness,”
at Melbourne Majesty s last xveek, the Firm
searched its waiting-list and found a sub-
stitute in Nora McManus. Nora, who satis-
factorily filled the gap at short notice, is,
however, to make way this week for Maggie
J arvis.
“Bain” ceases at Melbourne Palace to-
morrow night. On Saturday it will be the
turn of “The Wheel,” a new drama by
•fames Bernard Fagan.
The brightest scene of “The Garden of
Allah,” at Melbourne King’s, continues to
be the flashlight of Sin in the back streets
of Beni-Mora, while the most depressing
feature is the return of Brother Antoine to
the monastery after his little crowded hour
of glorious wife.
Eddie Russell, an American dancer, has
found a place in “Battling Butler,” at Mel-
bourne Princess’s. In his line Eddie is a
citizen of some renown. He has a cleverly
haphazard way of throwing himself about,
and always leaves the audience wondering
what his wayward feet will do next.

Melbourne Tivoli is livelier for Marie
Kendall, a red-headed comedienne who dis-
penses musical chutney artfully. Another
graduate in the same school is the restless
Jack Edwards, who is fairly bright, though
in Marie’s vein of philosophy he is only cut-
ting his teeth. Barker and Wynne combine
effectively in song and chatter, and Howard
Rogers is an impersonator who can still find
the curate humorous. Cecile, a danseuse who
isn’t so significant as her dressmaker, part-
ners a Yankee gent named Eldred, who
prances cleverly on a large golden ball, but
isn't a brilliant pattermonger. In the aero-
batic sphere Weyman and Companion do a
deft balancing turn.

Thea Proctor’s show in Melbourne:—
Thea Proctor’s art, revealed in Melbourne after an
absence of 10 years, retains all its old magic of
draughtsmanship and design. The most imaginative
part of her work is seen in her fans, wherein
dainty grotesques prance and shy maidens disclose
lines that are oddly reminiscent of Botticelli. In
these drawings also she demonstrates how seemingly
hostile colors can be thrown together into strangely
bewitching harmonies. It is astonishing to notice
how she juggles with raw washes without giving
offence. The nude bather, postured against an orange
wrap in No. SO, would seem bizarre if depicted by-
anybody else, yet Miss Proctor manages to invest the
picture with a queer fascination. But the charm of
artistic assurance is perceptible in all her efforts.
Even in the simple pencil studies of ballet dancers
the appeal is irresistible —the drawing is so good
and the vitality so surprising.
“Tangerine,” at Adelaide Prince of Wales’s,
is a riot of color, costume and dancing; also
of humor, in the making of which Mark Daly
and May Beatty work hard and with suc-
cess. Leyland Hodgson makes a firmer mark
now as hero, and Wesley Pierce, the dancer,
is developing a welcome vein of humor. Ire-
land Cutter has returned to America, and
will not be seen in Sydney. Robert Greig
enjoys himself thoroughly in “Baby Mine,’’
at the Royal, a rollicking, old-fashioned farce
which turns on the enforced production of a
baby— becoming twins presently, and finally

three of a kind. Beatrice Holloway is, of
course, the mother. In pictures nothing goes
better than the odd mixture, at the Pav., of
Fay Compton, in “This Freedom,” and the
Dempsey-Firpo fight, which latter confirms
the written suggestions at the time that with
fairplay the championship should have gone
south of the equator.

“Singemoine”: Nothing at Sydney Ma-
jesty’s is more diverting than Melba’s domi-
nation of the suburbanites. The atmosphere
on first nights is rather that of a cathedral
than a theatre —an English cathedral. In
Italy opera-going is a care-free, everyday
function, very like churclx-going, except that
smoking is forbidden in La Scala, whereas
it is permitted in the near-by cath-
edral where Carlo Borrommeo sleeps. Italian
patrons of opera like to applaud the num-
bers of which they approve, and to pass
brief remarks, derisive or otherwise, on the
appearance and methods of the players. (The
same practice was favored, incidentally, in
the Omnibus Box at Covent Garden when
Melba starred there in Edward YII/s day.)
In Sydney, however, it is good business to
differentiate the opera from every other sort
of entertainment; and the greatest show-
woman Australia (find for that matter any
modern country) possesses has done it to
some purpose. A number which has bees
familiarised by the gramophone has been
efficiently rendered, but not a sound follows.
Hundreds are gazing with dog-like attention
at the Diva ; b lien- place among the vice
regals. She remains motionless. Neverthe-
less a sacrilegious oaf in the circle claps.
His prototype in the stalls whispers: “Fine
—dam’ fine!” A lady wearing goloshes and
a magnificent string of synthetic pearls
hisses at the person in the circle like an
enraged serpent. Culture-lovers in the stalls
turn and glare at the whisperer as at a bomb-
thrower. Amidst a deadly hush the service
proceeds. It is great publicity stuff, of
course. Apart from putting this in truth
somewhat mediocre combination of foreign-
ers on a pedestal, it gives the liissers and
rebukers a cultural glow, as satisfying as a
Sabbath gossip over the back-fence concern-
ing the latest lapse of the local Messalina.
But to the mere entertainment-seeker such
Cromwellian regimentation is out of the pic-
ture, and induces a longing for the profes-
sional claque that goes to the other extreme
at the Paris Opera House.
“Flute” : Americo Gagliardi is the flautist
who puts in the frilly bits for Toti dal
Monte when she is jumping up and down
the scales in “Lucia.” His mellow tone and
accuracy of pitch and time make it diffi-
cult now and then to say which is the de-
mented Lucy and which the flute; but Gag-
liardi tires before Toti, and near the end of
the Mad Scene his notes are apt to get
scraggy. However, Dal Monte is thoroughly
satisfied with the little man’s work. Gag-
liardi, an Italian by birth, has lived in Mel-
bourne long enough to have played in many
J.C.W. orchestras, and acquired John
Amadio’s army of pupils when John went
abroad. Also, he has helped numerous con-
cert warblers to apostrophise the Gentle
Lark.
“M.D.”: When I consider the horrible
drivel operatic tenors have to warble I don’t
wonder at them getting touchy in the throat.
Many so-called lyrics, in the old operas
especially, have no more poetry in them than
the city clerk’s daily ode to Betty, the
shingled waitress —“Pie, roll and tea.” A
case in point is “Recondita Armonia,” the
opening song of Cavaradossi in “La Tosca.”
It sounds passionate enough for anything, but
the lyrist takes two lines to convey the in-
formation that Tosca has an ardent dis-
position, and a dark complexion ; two more
to explain that her eyes are black, whereas
another dame’s are blue; and three to an-
nounce that the tenor, now thoroughly
warmed up, thinks of Tosca only:—
11 mio pensiero,
Ah, il mio sol pensier sei tw 1
Tosea sei tu !
Bawling out stuff like that two or three
times a week for half the year would give
anyone chronic laryngeal catarrh, or what
Melba calls corns on the vocal chords (we
call it Chorditis nodosa, which sounds more
imposing). I can quite understand why John
McCormack inveighs against opera lyrics
and sticks to the concert platform, where
there is at least some scope for poetic ex-
pression.
“Santander” : Charles Hackett has a record
unapproached by any of the tenors in the
J.C.W. co. In the eight years of his operatic
career he has sung with Melba, Galli-Curci,
Geraldine Farrar, Battistini and many stars
of lesser brilliance. He was the hero of
“Traviata” 18 times in one month at the Cos-
tanzi Theatre in Rome, where Battistini
voiced the ruffled feelings of poor old Ger-
mont. The same baritone was Rigoletto
when Charles appeared as the Duke at the
Paris Opera House. Melba was Ilackett’s
Mimi when lie did Rudolfo in “Boheme” at
Co vent Garden ; and as Romeo in Gounod’s
sugary tragedy he went to the tomb with the
brilliant Galli-Curci at Chicago. As for
Geraldine Farrar she fell on his body when
he was shot on the battlements in “Tosca.”
Hackett made his debut in “La Traviata”
at Genoa, and has sung in every opera house
of note in the two hemispheres.
“S. Gumm”: I haven’t seen any comment
on the fact that the Newcastle (N.S.W.)
Steelworks Band, playing a setting of the
94th Psalm in competition with the best
bands in Britain except the Besses o’ the
Barn, lifted the first prize—a cup lined
wuth £l5O in Bank of England notes. Bert
Baile, the successful conductor, used to be
a grocer in Perth. His band is rarely men-
tioned in the musical columns of Big City
dailies, but on one occasion it was engaged
by Verbrugghen to supply half the pro-
gramme at one of the Belgian’s Sydney
Town Hall concerts. The experiment would
have been a rousing success had the conduc-
tor been advertised as one Benno Bailovitch
and liis steelworkers as White Russians just
escaped from the Bolshevists. As it was,
the takings about paid for the lights.
“Naklioda”: Since Australians will flock
in their thousands to opera sung in foreign
languages and acted with a conventionality
that borders on the ridiculous, they should
have no difficulty in tolerating Chinese
drama. Mei Lan Fang, the greatest star of
THE WAY IT HAPPENS.
“I wonder why you get an encore every
night?”
“Oh, I suppose one good turn deserves
another.”
the Chinese stage, has been invited to
America, and a movement is on foot to take
her to England; so Sydney may yet see a
Celestial rival to Dal Monte. As she never
makes a profit of less than £3OO a night in
her Shanghai theatre, and often exceeds
£5OO, the inducement will have to be
good. Once one has accepted the Chinese
stage convention one must admit that Mei’s
acting is superb. She is one of the few per-
formers for whom a Chinese audience will
stop chewing melon-seeds, sucking up tea and
eructating, to listen; although, like Sydney
audiences at Italian opera, three-quarters of
them do not understand a word of her classi-
cal diction, even when the din of the orchestra
allows it to be heard. Her Lien Chin Feng
sword-dance, performed on the bottom of the
sea in a cloudy atmosphere of goggle-eyed
fishes and ambulatory clams, is considered a
masterpiece of elegance. There will be no
stage-door business or green-room frivolity,
however. Mei Lan Fang, though always
seen in woman-parts, happens to be a man.
“Caesar’s Ghost”: Harry Muller succeeds
Harry Musgrove as director of the Tivoli
circuit. Twenty-two years ago Muller was
clerk to the firm which owned the quaint
old theatre in Palmerston North (M.L.)
an affable, bespectacled young man, who had
a way of overcoming difficulties for visiting
shows, and didn’t mind obliging when extra
gents, were wanted. On those occasions the
audience invariably identified him by his
specs. Dix spotted him as a useful man
for the show business, and the Fullers made
a branch manager of him. Now he has
climbed to the upper storey of vaudeville
management under the Firm, which has
taken over the circuit.
THE SPENDTHRIFT.
STELLA: “ What, you turned him down!
How do you know he’s extravagant?”
BELLA: “Oh, easy! When he came to pro-
pose to me he told the taxi to wait!"
“Norbell”: Talking of horses on the stage
(B. .3/7/’24), Alfred Dampier loved to have
them in “Robbery Under Arms.” Many an
old crock, carefully rugged, figured as Star-
light’s thoroughbred Rainbow in the “smalls,”
and most of Alfred’s actors and actorines
appeared as mounted outlaws, cops and bush-
girls, but I don’t think he was ever seen on
horseback in Australia himself. An accident
in his youth precluded it. He began his
professional career as a circus-rider, he told
me once. Any Pointer know about that?
“A.P.”: Melb. Philharmonic’s recent per-
formance of Elgar’s “Dream of Gerontius”
was the second local hearing this fine com-
position has had since the late Ernest Wood
introduced it nearly 20 years ago. The
other was the Sheffield Choir’s rendering in
1911, unforgettable for its treatment of the
Demons’ Chorus. In “Gerontius” Elgar had
a subject that possessed him thoroughly, and
the music is great. When Richard Strauss
heard it he referred to Elgar as “Master.”
Yet I suppose the name conveys nothing to
the peculiar people who rave over the latest
long-haired pianist and accept any dreary
rubbish as a work of genius provided the
perpetrator is a ’ski or a ’vitch.
“10-2-4” : Sydney dailies recorded that “at
Taree recently the first Sunday moving-
picture service attracted a large attendance.
The local clergy witnessed a private screen-
ing of the picture (‘The Silent Voice’)
during the week, and pronounced a very
favorable judgment. The Rev. Mr. Russell
preached a sermon on it.” Then the kill-
joys got to work : —-
A sermon has been preached in the Methodic
church against Sunday pictures, and the theatre pro-
prietary has been approached by the clergy and re-
quested not to open again on Sundays for pictures
or' any kind.
Apathy amongst electors and churchgoers is
due to the same root causes. There is no
apathy when a Dean Inge or Canon Barnes
is in the pulpit, or when a forceful political
candidate is on the platform. Unfortunately
the supply of interesting preachers is limited.
Why, then, not search for adventitious aids?
If sermons are to be got out of stones it is
certainly possible to base them on good travel-
pictures. A film such as “Crossing the
Sahara,” which is now the rage in England,
might serve as a text for many sermons. It
will never reach Australia, apparently, un-
less the churches help to create a demand for
such productions. We shall be left with
the imbecilities and obscenities that emanate
from Hollywood.
“Adelaide” : Visiting players have just had
two unpleasant experiences in Adelaide. One
of them, William Mollison’s bad ankle-sprain,
was ingeniously incorporated by him with
his part in “Enter, Madame,” which he had
to take for two evenings while limping on
sticks. The other mishap didn’t get into the
papers. The next-door neighbor to June
Roberts, at the South Australian Hotel,
heard a muffled but continuous knocking one
evening, and at last felt bound to go in to
see if anything was wrong. Something was.
The little lady had entered a clothes-cupboard
which closed on her, and had no handle in-
side. And there she remained till rescued,
with no air to speak of, and a performance
in which she was absolutely required less
than an hour away.
“Ancient Prompter”: The play was Sheri-
dan Knowles’s “Virginius,” and the old mum-
mer east for the part of Numitorius was
causing the boss some anxiety at rehearsals.
Invariably “fluffy” in his lines, in this par-
ticular character he found it difficult to re-
member the name he bore. This was awk-
ward, for at a critical moment he had to
rush on and say, “Hold ! 'Tis I, her father,
Numitorius.” The friendly stage-manager
advised him. “Think of the Book of Num-
bers in the Bible, Dad. Numbers—Numi-
torius. See!” Dad did, and spent hour
after hour repeating to himself the words
“Numbers, Num-itorius.” But on the first
night he dashed on and bellowed, “Hold!
’Tis I. her father, Deuteronomy!”
“E.T.”: A small-part mummer had the
temerity to accost the Dramatic Critic of a
great daily. “It’s a little matter of busi-
ness,” he explained apologetically. “You
said in your notice that Mr. Kean Siddons
—that’s me—‘will give a better performance
of the broker’s man when he is more
acquainted with his few lines.’ ” “Well,
what’s wrong with that?” asked the scowling-
critic. “Oh, nothing much,” Siddons hastened
to assure him. “Only I didn’t play that part.
My name was down for it, but I got ’flu and
couldn’t appear the first night, so the under-
study went on.” ‘*Oh, I see,” said the
critic in a kinder tone. “If you could just
mention the true facts I’d be obliged,” Sid-
dons insinuated. “Well, I don’t mind point-
ing out that there was an error in the pro-
gramme,” said the critic graciously. “That
will do nicely,” returned the mummer, over-
joyed. “Now, far be it from me to bribe
the press, but will you come and have a
beer and a bite of counter-lunch ?”
“D.D.”: I like that report from Mayenee
about the police-inspector who was attacked
by five men “for political reasons.” The
political reasoners seized his person and tied
him to a railway-line. After a tremendous
struggle the police-inspector managed to drag
himself to the middle of the line, and the
train passed over without injuring him. So
is truth proved to be as strange as melo-
drama, and in this wise are 500 picture-
plays justified.
“T. 0.1.” : Australia has had scene-painters
who were good actors, notably Ben Tannett
and W. J. Wilson. Ben was usually Banquo
to G. V. Brooke’s Macbeth; moreover, he
was the Australian original of Grazebrook in
“The Unequal Match,” which introduced
Ellen Mortyn to a Melbourne audience. She
and Fanny Cathcart were Brooke’s leading
ladies. Wilson, who died in Sydney, was
fine in country-yokel parts, and was the ori-
ginal Robin Wildbriar in Edmund Falconer’s
“Extremes, or Men of the Day,” produced
on the second opening of Melbourne Olympic
Theatre (the Iron Pot) after the split be-
tween Brooke and Coppin. Rosa Dunn was
the Lucy Vavasour of that production.
“0. Ockney”: The newest and probably
the youngest theatrical manager in London
is Martin Lewis, who gave some bright
examples of light-comedy and “juvenile” act-
ing in Australia with the Julius Knight-
Irene Browne co. Lewis has commenced
business at the Savoy with a play of the
“Cat and Canary” type called “The Lure,”
and all his friends are hoping that the title
will prove prophetic. In the cast is Cecil
Humphreys, here last year with Oscar Asche
in “Cairo” and “Julius Caesar.”
“L.H.P.” : The elephant in “Round the World
in Eighty Days” (B. 3/7/’24) was borrowed
from the old Moore Park Zoo. The piece ran
from Feb. 10 to March 6, 1894, at Sydney
Lyceum, and among those who shared the
limelight with Jumbo were George Ireland,
Teddy Sass, Harry Leston, Bob Courtneidge,
Plenrietta Watson, Polly Emery, Emma
Gwynne, D’Orsy Ogden, Fred Dark, A. G.
Poulton and Mario Majeroni.
“Orb”: “Wilfrido’s” dear old lady who
thought “Carmen” so “Italianesque” (B.
3./7/’24) reminds me of a lady who sat near
me at Her Majesty’s, Melbourne, when H. B.
Irving was doing Dubose in “The Lyons
Mail.” After the show she sighed happily
and said to her male escort, “Ah, ain’t ’e
love-er-ly! I see ’im in King Lewis (Louis
XI.) an’ now in this, an’ if you ask me ’c
can play Shakspeare better’n Dan Barry.”
THE MODEST VETERAN.
[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
A veteran of fifty years’ experience am I,
A man of many parts, and learned in technique
and convention.
Without egotism I may say that anything I try
Is excellently realised and noble in intention.
There is nothing that I touch but i, improved quite
out of sight;
I lend distinction to the part of Hamlet, I may
tell you ;
My Romeo is subtly and exquisitely right;
As lago my performance would artistie’ly repel you.
I’m the finest Wilfred Denver that’s been seen on
any stage;
My Othello is unequalled in the present genera-
tion ;
My gift for comedy has set its mark upon the age,
And Toby Belch has won for me full many an
ovation.
As Malvolio I think I show a talent quite unique,
And my Cassar’s a performance that’s refined and
most appealing ;
With resonance and beauty Shakspeare’s lines I
always speak,
And my physical perfections, I may add, there’s
no concealing.
But I’m just a simple actor, void of vanity and pride,
A man, although I say it, who is listened to and
heeded ;
The severest forms of criticism I soberly abide
Provided that the foregoing facts are righteously
conceded.

Merited Progress
FROM a small beginning, with 200 workers in 1886, Westing-
house has steadily progressed. Its history forms mile-stones in
the march of civilization.
It has served the world by doing its work well. The world
in turn has approved the product of its labour. Today
Westinghouse is an organization of 50,000 workers with 24
separate works covering 600 acres.
Be it a fan, a table-stove, or a powerful locomotive; a
hydro-electric plant, a motor-driven machine or an electric
supply station, if it bears the mark of Westinghouse, its users
will declare it good.
In arranging for Ihc distribution of its products
Westinghouse will be pleased to hear from firms
acting as distributors.

MISS ELSIE PARKES,
the Beautiful Australian Actress and
Dancer appearing with the “Tons
of Money” Co., at the Opera House.
A Dainty Advocate of Mercolized
Wax for the Skin,
FOR A
BEAUTIFUL SKIN
Wash your face in warm watei.
and while the skin is still damp
lightly smear a little pure mercolized
wax over your face and neck, and
leave on until the morning. After a
few nights of this treatment the
blemishes on your skin should dis
appear.
Mercolized wax dissolves away
the old, dry skin and leaves behind
a new, healthy complexion. Beauty
is but skin deep—mercolized wax
brings it to the surface. It is empha-
sised that this wax is quite harmless,
and contains only the purest ingre-
dients, being free from any poison-
ous mercury salts
The meaning of the word "mer-
colized” is “active,” and its activity
is obtained from its oxygen content,
which is Nature’s own beautifier. As
a general facial cleanser mercolized
wax is unequalled, being in universal
everyday use by up-to-date, dis-
criminating women. Husbands also
find it beneficial for use after shav-
ing, especially if the skin is chafed.
It should always be used before the
application of powder, as the wax
will prevent the pores of the skin
from becoming clogged and un-
healthy.
All Chemists can supply you with
pure mercolized wax, in neat,
original tins, containing sufficient to
last from six to eight weeks. Price,
5/6 per tin, or post free from

WHY NEW CAPITAL IS REQUIRED.
The Directors of the Bank have been much impressed with the great and substantial developments
of Western Australia, which they are confident will continue. This opinion is based not only on the
general progress of the State, but on the increased volume of new business offering, and the growing
demands for accommodation by the Bank’s customers. . ,
In order that this new business shall be handled effectively, more capital is required, and tne
Directors have accordingly decided to issue 122,000 £1 shares, being the balance of the 200,000 Shares
authorised by the shareholders. , .. , .. .
100,000 of these Shares being underwritten in London, the Directors have decided to call ict
applications in Australia for 22,000 £1 Shares at a premium of £1 10s. each, providing the Bank,
altogether, with £305,000 new funds.
DIVIDENDS.
Whilst in no way making any promise or guarantee in connection with future dividends, the
Directors are of opinion there will not be any difficulty in distributing profits to the extent ot n
per cent, on the existing capital of £378,000. together with the new capital now being sougnt.
Dividends will be payable in any Australian capital, Auckland, Wellington, Dunedin or Bondo i,
free of exchange. Dividends will be payable half-yearly in May and November. ...
■All new Shares will rank for dividend, and in all other respects pan passu with tne exKtin„
ordinary Shares of the Bank, except that the shares are only entitled to receive dividends pro rata Horn
the Ist July, 1924, for the half-year ending 29th September, 1924. c ,,„ ov „ {cJn „

Hayband: That stocks were in use in
York-street, Sydney, is in no doubt; what that con-
tributor wanted to know was whether they lasted
down to the ’fifties.... Per C.: He means well, but
his figures are wrong, because the people examined
were not representative... .F.S.T.: As dull as 2cwt.
of pig-lead... .F.W.R.: Regret we haven’t the space
to keep that discussion going. .. .Phon: Sorry. As
it was printed that Red Page sentence was wrong.
A “whom” strayed in where a “who” should have
been... .P.M.8.; Too vague.... Pahiatua: Not quite
interesting enough... .Senex: Yes, but is the lady
herself still alive?... .Aitape: Too much of it fol-
lows old furrows... .C.A.N.: Far too wordy, and
mostly a crackling of dry sticks.... Guilberto: Very
well done for your age.... Murrawee: He was a fre-
quent contributor 20 years and more ago. .. .8.C.P.:
You are six months late... .R.C.8.: You made it
very dull. .. .R. F.mpty: Thanks, quite right. That
accountant, like many of his tribe, expresses himself
so badly that a dash had to be made at his meaning
And it wasn’t caught. The actual cost of getting a
sheep’s wool off seems to be about 7d. to Bd. in the
,li of the value... .Shanghai: Too many rhymes
dragged in by the whiskers... .L.O’N.: Its meaning
is too obscure... .W.8.R.: Far too many warts on
«it C.C.G.: Not quite... .8.D.: Both miss, but not
by a great distance.... Tramp: Five times you say
that you want to go back, and each' time you say
it a little less attractively.... Deni: Glad to hear
you “have been very well educated in the English
language.” But why don’t you write it?....
McG.N.: Doesn’t get near... . Embee: Shocking waste
of good paper and passable ink... .'Alary 8.: Not
bad ; but the same thing lias been doit- dozens of
times. .. .Charity P.: You say you want to “show
something to the world at large. - ’ It would oe
difficult to guess what it is from the screed you
send... .F.D.D.: Try us with something simpler and
more direct. .. .Ripponlea: “For Such is Love” fills

And I treat you with despision;
I don’t care a bally brass
Farthing for caste or class!
With Love my head is dizzy,
And I’m going to marry Lizzie.”
And so when Spring was blooming,
With senses swooning,
In the Organ’s roar,
When the ceremony was o’er,
With radiant smile,
Adown the aisle
Did he lead with pardonable pride
His abo. bride.
. ...Nollig: Very slight and would need a lot of
sand-papering. .. .H.0.J.: The “Zephyr” is a good
first attempt, but it does not say enough that is
new. Try again.... Stan H.: The verse walks along
in short jerky strides with a jolt to each line; the
matter is weak and thin. .. .Mariner: It has no
grammar worth speaking of; and generally it con-
sists of imitation flowers thrown about on a shovel.

hidden.... Harold T.: It falls by the wayside

clumsily.... J.P.R.: The verse isn’t strong enough
to carry it through.... Rolfe S.: Not up....5.H.
(Stanhope); The tramping person is a bit short of
interest.... Bellerive: So realistic that even the read-
ing of it made us a little squeamish:—
The sailing yachts of Hobart,
In beauteous array,
Present a charming picture
On a summer day.
Tossing-o’er the bosom
Of the Derwent wide and free,
Followed by the prancing gulls,
Bird rovers of the sea.
The sailing yachts of Hobart,
In beauteous array,
Danceth o’er the waters
Till the close of day.

bad.... A.A.G.: The little yarn there is has been

skill C.L. (Maldon): Empty and badly written.

Couldn’t be much worse E.S.H.: Not for this six-

Royal Cord Tyres Are
Now Made by Three
New Processes Which
Have Revolutionized
Tyre Making
THE development by the United States Rubber Company of
three remarkable new processes of rubber manufacture now
gives to Royal Cord Tyres a quality never before reached by
any tyre.
1. The New Sprayed Rubber. A method so effective thai
a virgin rubber of a quality never known until now is made
available to the world.
2. The New Web Cord. Of specific application to the art
of cord tyre making. A process of treating fabrics and cords
with latex, making it possible to manufacture tyres and other
articles with a degree of strength hitherto unattained.
3. The New Flat-Band Building Process. A method of
building cord tyres which is revolutionary. Finally and af
last assuring uniform cushioning and resistance in cord tyres.
Taken alone, either of these new discoveries would be regarded as
of the utmost significance, but together they are hailed as the most
important advance in the field of rubber manufacture since the
discovery of vulcanization nearly a century ago.
These three basic discoveries, fully protected by patents in the
U. S. A. and other countries, are the exclusive property of the
United States Rubber Company, makers of Royal Cord Tyres.
Obtainable at all Garag'es.

Women have learned that the carpet
sweeper is for the many-times-a-day
sweeping—to pick up litter, threads,
crumbs, the daily dust.
And that the cleaner is for periodic
cleaning which no woman does every
day. So even where there is a cleaner
the Bissell is still indispensable—the
easiest, most efficient and durable
sweeper made. And, lasting 10 years
or more, on the average, it is obviously
the most economical.
A Bissell “Cyco” Ball Bearing Carpet Sweep-
er is much more than a box, four wheels and
a brush. It is a perfect mechanism, with ex-
clusive features that ensure thorough work,
easy running, long life.
There are Toy Sweepers for the little ones
too and at small cost.

where. Booklet on request.

“Edo”: Consumers are complaining bit-
terly of the shameful way in which Mel-
bourne butter is overloaded with water. The
water is worked into the butter, because the
sale of water at Is. 6d. per lb. is a distinctly
profitable transaction. Those misguided
people who say that grease and water will
not mix Know little of the subterfuges of
butter-dealers.
* * * *
“Fitz”: The timber used on the trig, sta-
tions on the N.S.W. central coastal area is
Oregon pine. Around one trig, station are
growing splendid ironbark, grey-gum, _ white
mahogany and other good Australian timbers
that last, but apparently past Government
departments have preferred the imported
article. The Education Department used im-
ported timber in a public school in one of
the biggest timber centres of the North Coast,
and even had to fell trees to get the imported
wood on to the site.
* * * *
“Sturt”: Governor Bridges (S.A.) has
given a strong hint to local motorists, as
the Admiral did during the Fleet visit, that
Britain produces just as good cars as the
U.S.A. After being shown over the Holden
motor-body factory (the largest of its kind
in Australia) he told the directors: “I
should like to feel that the 33,000 bodies
you have contracted for were for English
chassis. The Commonwealth is paying away
every year from eight to nine millions for
American cars —though we pretend that
some of them are Canadian.”
* * * *
“Bill o’ Costs”: Jacobs v. Davis, which is
supposed to have established the right of the
jilted swain to recover from the inconstant
lady the presents made in anticipation of
marriage (B. 19/6/’24), is noteworthy for
a neat bit of satire on the part of Justice
Shearman, who tried the case. Thus his Lud-
ship : “The plaintiff alleged that on the day
of the engagement he gave the defendant a
ring on the express condition that it should
be returned if the marriage did not take
place. If I were dealing with the psychology
of a class of people with whom I am more
familiar than I am with Jews, I would not
hesitate to disbelieve the story.” It was also
a dexterous way of intimating that the
Judge himself was not one of the Chosen,
although his name might expose him to a
slight suspicion.
* * * *
“Yardley”: Re the attempt to foist used
stamps on the Post Office (B. 5/6/’24).
Last week a married woman of my acquaint-
ance received from Spencer-street, Mel-
bourne, an insistent demand for the address
of X Y , of Z . The demand hav-
ing been ignored as surely a blunder, the
letter-carrier called on the lady and explained
that a cancelled stamp had been attached to
a letter addressed to her, and that the Postal
authorities intendeu to prosecute the addres-
sor. My friend spent half a day in travelling
to discover that a mother had told her chil-
dren that they might write a letter to their
former neighbor. One of the brood, a nine-
year-old believer in thoroughness, had
secured an obliterated stamp, attached it to
the envelope and posted the missive.
* * * *
“Sturt”: A. C. Macdonald, stationowner
beyond Broken Hill, says motor transport of
stock as well as of supplies is going to re-
volutionise things out there. One lorry lately
landed 45 rams from Broken Hill on his
station, 245 miles out, within 24 hours and
in perfect condition. Droving the same num-
ber. he says, used to take about eight weeks,
with a probable loss of a dozen head and the
rest temporarily unfit for use on arrival.
The return load of wool, too, went dow'n in
a day; it would have taken five or six weeks
per camel team. Also to be scrapped is the
inconvenient old system of getting in half
a year’s supplies at once, the camel team-
sters not caring to start with anything
under a five-ton loading. But the biggest
saving is expected to come in drought time,
with the expeditious shifting of stock. Tracks
will have to be improved in the sandhill coun-
country, Macdonald admits, but “within two
years there won’t be a single camel on the
track.”
* * . * *
“G. Moses”: The Queensland cotton boom
is less boomful than it was —in the South, at
all events. First, the weather being dry,
much of the crop never came up, which is
always liable to happen when the herb is
ploughed in and replanted every year. Then
unexpected frosts killed a good deal in its
youth, which is equally liable to occur when
the herb has a fresh youth each year. There
were more insects and less labor than were
expected. Also the Government, which had
ordered under heavy penalties that the
cotton-plants should be ploughed in and re-
planted every year, found it was short of
gaols to accommodate the law-breakers, and
took to burying the past. And the men
who ploughed in their old plants, and got
nothing because the new ones didn’t come
up, want the vacillating Ministry to pay
what they estimate they lost by being so
darned foolish as to obey the law. With
decent management the future should be all
right, but the present is chaotic.
* * * *
“X.Y.”: Beside the “butcher-boat” (B.
12/6/’24) there was a class of craft first
pi’oduced in Sydney that deserves a word of
mention. This was the Sydney whaleboat,
which combined more useful characteristics
than any boat afloat to-day. Of about the
same length and beam as the butcher-boat,
it was unexcelled for speed and seaworthi-
ness. Eight oarsmen provided the motive
power. The boats were sharp at both bow
and stern, with a very strongly-marked sheer,
and built of cedar. They combined light-
ness with strength and a surprising amount
of stability for a craft of that beam. Having
proved their worth in the whale trade, they
were adopted as sea-going boats all along the
coast wherever the necessary man-power was
available, and especially for pilot service.
Designed originally for use in the rough
Antarctic waters, where the Arctic whale-
boats had been tried and found wanting,
they attracted the attention of the cedar-
getters, who used them to open up the im-
mense sub-tropical brushes of the North
Coast, and to establish an export trade be-
fore the advent of the farmer or grazier.

Old O. J. Scrutton, the last of Frank
Jardine’s expedition to Cape York in 1864,
can still, as a rider, beat many of the
younger stockmen in the McArthur River
country, where he has a small cattle sta-
tion ; and although he is 88 he can read with-
out glasses by the light of a slush lamp .with
the rest of them.
“H.K.”: As an instance of the rise in Syd-
ney suburban land values since Queen Vic-
toria was crowned, consider a block at
Bondi which later became the Junction. Ori-
ginally a 60-acre block, it was granted by
the Crown to one Hatley, jun., in 1837. He
valued his piece of earth hut lightly,, selling
it to William Foreman for an old horse.
The new owner doesn’t appear to have
thought he had made much of a bargain
either, for he parted with it to Daniel Bevy
for a cask of wine. A couple of years ago
the State’s Valuer-General appraised it at
approximately £2,000,000.
Drunkards with convictions rivalling crack
cricket scores are many, but men convicted
100 times or more for breaches of borough
hy-laws are rare owls. One such passed out
the other day at Kaiwarra (MX.). lie was
a genial'soul, with the front name ot Patrick,
and faced the Court over five times every
year for a quarter of a century. While wait-
ing to hear once again the S.M.’s familiar
dictum that “this practice of letting cows
run on the road must be put a stop to, iat
fell forward on a court table and died a tew
minutes later. In death he did what he had
failed to do all his life —saved his fine.
From an old union secretary: —
The Tammany boss who strikes trouble has various
ways of crawling back to safety. One of them is
called “Special summoned meeting.” Blather, having
been sacked or expelled as an undesirable, appeals
for a rehearing of his case at “a special summoned
meeting.” The date is fixed by the executive, in
which Blather has friends, and soon members who
had been congratulating themselves on having got
rid of Blather, are astonished to hear that Blather
has been reinstated. Their summonses to attend
the special meeting didn’t arrive until that function
or swindle was over, but the Postal Department can
be blamed for that. Somebody—presumably the same
Postal Department—sees that Blather’s friends get
theirs in plenty of time.
“Kowsara”: An enterprising person who
was recently arrested at night in the door-
way of a South Brisbane shop and subse-
quently charged with having house-breaking
instruments in his possession, told rather an
ingenious story in court. His version, which
was much the same as he had previously given
to the police, was that lie was waiting tor
his girl, to take her to a dance. lor this
reason he carried white gloves. I Ini ham-
mer was to repair his kitbag, _ and tne
revolver to protect himself and his inamorata
from the hooligan bands which have lately
been prominent in Brisbane suburbs. Ihe
electric-torch was to find his way to his
room without disturbing his fellow-lodgers.
The jury disbelieved him, but he managed
to get the benefit of the First Offenders
Act.
Dr. J. A. Leach, the* new Assistant Chief
Inspector (Vic.), is the outstanding* special-
ist who has made Nature Study and loving
care of native flora and fauna part of
the curriculum in State schools. His new
book, to the preparation of which he gave
all his leisure for years, compasses the whole
of his subjects. Leach went about Ins mis-
sion tactfully; he taught teachers how to
teach his pet subjects, organised tens of
thousands of adult Victorians into Nature
Study excursionists and students, and asked
for a definite five minutes a day of school
work. He jambed home to cockies and
orchardists that the birds as a body were
their salvation, abolished the shanghai, and
evolved a moral tone among the kiddies that
made the private box of birds’ eggs and the
festoons of magpies, parrots and laughing-
jack’s eggs on school walls impossibilities. As
a result of all this and his successful work
as an inspector in the field, he is now No. 3
in the State’s education system.
“J.H.M.A.”: During the comparatively
short lifetime of Sydney the points and coves
of the Harbor have undergone so many
changes of title that one wonders what they
may be in another 100 years. The trams,
for instance, which embark and disembark
hundreds of thousands of passengers daily on
and from Sydney Cove, have their destina-
tion-boards marked “Circular Quay,” and
newspaper shipping columns give the his-
toric little bay its proper title only when they
refer to the hours of high water. Great Sirius
Cove is always Mosman Bay, though for
the first 40 years of British-Australian his-
tory it bore the former name, which had
itself superseded the aboriginal Gorane-
Bullagong-Bullagong. Taking the north of
Port Jackson side first, the native name for
Middle Head was Cubba-Cubba. and Brad-
ley’s Head was Burrogy. The lengthy title
of Mosman is referred to above, and Cre-
morne (or Robertson’s) Point was M al-
warra-Jeeong. Part of Milson s 1 omt is
still Kirribilli; but nobody ever hears Laven-
der Bay spoken of as Quibcree. On the
southern side, Laing’s (or Green) Point
close to Camp Cove, was Ivabungharra, and
Watson’s Bay—re-named after the Robei t
Watson who was appointed chief pilot in
1811 and not after Captain Thomas Watson,
who was a pilot in the ’thirties, and sub-
sequently Harbor Master, and lived down
thoro had the aboriginal title of Kootti.
Vaucluse was Moring. and Steel Point (fool-
ishly re-christened Nielsen Park, after a
transient Minister for Lands) was Baam-
billv Point Piper’s original Willara still
survives in Woollahra. Rose Bay was Pan-
npr-romr Darling Point was Yara-nabe, and
still has its Yarranabe-road, whilst Potts
Point was Carrajeen. The earliest name of
Woolloomooloo was too original and striking
for alteration, though its curliest phonetic
spelling was Wulamulla. Mrs. Macquarie s
Point —often erroneously styled Lady Mac-
quarie's—was Ynrong. and Benelong Point,
named after Governor Phillip s dusky pal,
was known by the natives as Jubugbalce.
Dawes Point, across the Cove, was Tarra.
Tt is sometimes referred to m early records
as Maskelyne Point, because the astronomi-

Astronomer-Royal, had originally been set up
there.

[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
* GAINST the sunset’s streamers
\ The headlands seem to be
Like bows of giant steamers
All ready for the sea,
Yet held by frothy cables
That tie them to the land,
Where bays in greens and sables
Wear lace along the strand.
Out northward, in the distance,
Where dusk the coastline dims,
A steamer’s swinging pistons
Are singing ocean hymns.
Far south the rollers thunder
With tossing crests in line,
And through a night of wonder
The lights of steamers shine.
From Tweed Heads they are steering,
From Twofold Bay they steam,
On courses set for clearing
The lofty capes o’ dream ;
And when the night spreads over
The headlands and the bays,
Her mantle cannot cover
The coastwise lanterns’ rays.
They are as headlights crowning
These stranded landward bows
That face the surges, frowning.
Perchance one night they’ll rouse
From age-long roles as dreamers
Until they are in truth
The bows of giant steamers
Earth dreamt of in her youth.
Hoarse cries on Barren joey
Would tell of lines let go.
Though thick the night and blowy,
Out she would move and show
The biggest, blackest vessel
That ever left the beach....
Hark, how the great seas wrestle,
Each shouting unto each!
Ben Buckler’s bows are stirring,
Maroubra will not stay;
With mighty engines purring,
Old Avalon’s away.
She moves to sea by inches—■
Ah, what a night ’twill be
When to the clank of winches
The headlands put to sea !

Arbitration and Conciliation.
[FOR THE BULLEITN.]
Micky, being an honest working-man
and no time-server, unconsciously
put himself on his honor to toil
harder while his employer, Denny Deneen,
was absent at Warwick. The early sun was
making the granite beautiful, and the massed
forest behind it, and every garden gay with
bloom. It was a shining day, breathing
easily as if it slept without weariness, and
Micky sang at his work on the boots, and
laughed at the vagaries of a certain buff
Orpington, the comedian of the feeding fowls ;
and milked the cow t s gladly, and hummed as
he revolved the handle of the cream separa-
tor. The day was one of those days when
all healthy men think with the timorous
despot:—•
On pain of death, let no inan say the name of Death
to me.
It is a word infinitely terrible.
In such beauty the meanest habit is gilded ;
the humblest work finds its dignity and its
pleasure, habit and health making the sauce
for the feast; nothing in life is common or
unclean, and the meanest office is very dear,
as in the time of the Norseman Garth, the
Thrall of Atli, who when offered a warrior’s
fame wept because he was ordered from his
beautiful life of herding swine.
Micky s work was done so early that in
mere pride of energy lie seized an axe and
attacked the woodpile. Leaving five or six
hundredweight of fireside lengths as evidence,
he then went to breakfast, and afterwards
lighted a cigarette and crossed the road to
the hotel. On its verandah was Mrs. Cleg-
horn’s Uncle in a devotional attitude—Uncle,
like a kangaroo bent the wrong way, groan-
ing as he perfunctorily scrubbed the veran-
dah.
"Enjoyin’ y’rself ?” inquired Micky.
Enjoyin’ meself!” groaned the aged man.
My Gord ! I just like t’ see you enjoyin’
yerself scrubbin’ boards. It’s hardwood, too;
an’ big splinters get up y’r nails if y’r don’t
keep awake when y’r scrubbin’.”
‘‘How much d’ye get?”
A pound a week and tucker.”
i , th,'”, sa id Micky. “I on’y get ten
sinHm s. An I bet I’m as good as five Uncles
wit white whiskers.”
<ir? on ’t be impident, me lad.”
. Gerrout!” said Micky. “Impident! “I’ll
give y a punch on the nose.”
Diplomatic relations being thus suspended.
Uncle returned to his work of groaning and
scrubbing, and Micky walked down the sunlit
street thinkin . Presently he met the barber
who was the politician of Quart Pot—not
the only politician, but one of the three,
the other two were, naturally, the local tailor
and the local bootmaker; for from sedentary
occupations come revolutionaries. Micky
got into the chair and ordered a shave, mean-
ing thereby that he wished the removal' of
the down upon his face. The barber gave
him a real man’s lathering, and scraped off
the raw silk that Micky regarded as a beard
And then Micky told the barber of the con-
versation with (Leghorn’s Uncle on the sub-
ject of Industrialism.
t “ The ol<l b,oke ’ s right,” said the barber
Its a question of Labor versus Capital-’
fin Denny Deneen’s pullin’ y’r leg. Why
ten shillin’s a week is sweatin’! Ain’t Jr
old man a unionist?”
“My oath! My old man’s one of the
oldest bush-workers there is. He was down
Dt Eulo with Harry Coyne. Unionist*? Mv
oath! He was one of the first in the
Union before the A.W.U.”
Y’r father is a good unionist, an’ you
take ten shillin’s a week? I don’t know
wliat the award is, or if there’s an award
tor your .job; but, by cripes, Mick, if you
take a job at ten shillin’s a week you’re a
scab.”
"No fear; I’m no scab! An’ I get me
tucker there, an’ sleep at home.”
“No good, Micky! That old loafer Uncle
gets a pound a week and keep, and you get
ten shillin’s and tucker. Micky, you’re a
scab!”
"I'll hit y’ in the teeth if y’ call me a
scab,” said Micky, and having waited a
decent minute for hostilities, walked away
with all the honors of war, but sick at
heart. He badly wanted the increased wages
he knew he had earned; but as against that
he liked Denny, and was also afraid of him.
But a .“scab”! He thought all day, and
thought as he did the evening chores, and
when he went to bed he had decided. A
‘scab” ! How shall a man prove he is not
a “scab”? There is but one way—the strike!
Next morning the pigeons twittering in the
dewy eaves to call him from his nar-
row bed. He heard the call of duty,
visualised the waiting fowls and cows
and tne boots vainly appealing for blacking,
and he hardened his heart, and turned to
sleep again to signify the strike was on.
* * * *
On the day the strike was declared Denny
Deneen, who had returned the evening be-
fore, rose early as usual, and at 7 o’clock
was at the kitchen for his early cup of tea.
Something strange was in the air. There
were the boots with last night’s mud on
them, and others merely dusty; there were
the fowls quarrelling and shrieking, their
world disjointed because they were unfed;
the calves silent because there had been
yet no separation from their mothers. Then
Denny became conscious of the absence of
Micky.
“Micky not here?” he asked of his wife,
with the tone of one who relates that the
axis of the world has slipped in its bear-
ings. “The poor lad not here! He would
be dead, then, or maybe typhoid faver, or
run over be a horse, or bit be a dog.”
His wife, remarking that these specula-
tions would lead nowhere, and that the ex-
planation of Micky’s absence was to be
found in an inquiry of Micky himself, Denny
took his hat and stick, and walked up the
white road to the house of Micky’s father —
a little house almost concealed by weird
forms of weathered granite-rocks that made
Micky’s father’s property appear as the
skittle-alley of giants; here a granite skittle
and there a granite cheese.
Denny rapped with his blackthorn upon
the cottage-door, and Micky’s mother opened
it. She was the sinewy bushwoman to the
life, all wire and whipcord, of tissue inde-
structible ; and with the merry heart and
the sense of humor of the aboriginal to hide
her femininity the more.
“H’lo, Mister Deneen,” said Micky’s
mother. “You’re up early this way.”
“An’ I am that. I kem up because Micky
haven’t kem down.”
“I called him, but he said he wouldn’t get
up this mornin’.”
“Oh. he wouldn’t, wouldn’t he? Is he
sick, then ?”
“No, he’s all right. But he says he wouldn’t
go to work to-day.”
“Oh. he wouldn’t, wouldn’t he? Would
you ask him to come out here?”
“I’ll tell him. Hey, Micky! Put on
your pants and come an’ see Mister Deneen.”
Micky appeared, his trousers held up by
one suspender, the other in his haste left
dangling.
“H’lo, Mister Deneen.”
“H’lo yourself. Why is it you’re not down
doin’ the boots an ’the cows an’ the chooks
an’ the firewood?”
“No good to me. I’m on strike.”
“Oh, ho, ho! You’re on slitrike, are you?
Since whin?”
“Since now.”
“An’ what might you be shtrikin’ for, may
I make bould to ask you?”
Micky knew this deceptive calm, and feared
it; but he was made of good stuff and was
steadfast, once decided.
“I’m on strike because- I ain’t gettin’
’nough wages. An’ blokes called Tne a scab
for workin’ for ten shillin’s a week, and old
Uncle the Loafer gets a pound.”
“Oh, you’ll fix your own wages, will you?
Now, may ye slitarve before I give you an-
other tuppence a mont’. Shtarve, an’ I’ll do
the thriflin’ little jobs meself. An’ don’t let
me see y’r face ag’in—an’ don’t ye walk in
front of me house. Shtarve you, me proud-
stomached buck. Shtarve!”
He strode dowm the garden-path, and was
almost hidden by the gigantic granite skittles
between the house and the road when Micky’s
merry mother hailed him.
“Mister Deneen !”
“Yis?”
“Mister Deneen”—-and her air held an
exaggerated respect —“will you let Micky
stay in Australia to-night?”
“Grrrr!” said Denny and hurried away.
Walking down the hill he made up his mind
to fight the Micky Strike to the finish. Not
only his carefulness for money—the result
of the bitter poverty of his training in his
native village—but his authority as Price
Fixer, Determinator of Wages and Lord of
Employment had been attacked. Who was
Micky that he should fix his own wages or
indeed have any say in such a matter? The
ideal relations of Capital and Labor were
those providing that Capital should say
“Here be broken meats” and Labor, bowing
its head in gratitude, should reply—“ Praise
God from whom all blessings flow.”
But these Australians'had a code of their
own ; when a transplanted squire looked for
the forelock that should be pulled in Squire s
respect, lie found that they had maliciously
cut their hair short in front.
“I’ll do his dam’ little jobs meself,” said
Denny, and began with an ill-tempered
energy and a hatred in his heart that en-
sures for any effort a faulty performance.
He discovered that he hated cleaning boots,
that fowls are the last word in stupidity
(although the foolishness of calves is a
strong rival), that the turning of a cream
separator makes the arms ache, and that
Pigs are tractable only when converted to
bacon.. Incidentally, he found a new respect
for Micky’s efficiency growing in him. But
he was stubborn and lie fought himself, the

Old People’s
Kidneys
Many Elderly People Suffer
from Some Form of
Kidney Trouble
WHEN past middle age there frequently
comes a noticeable weakening of the
organs of the body, and resulting danger
of quick decline. It is quite necessary to give
prompt help to any part that first shows signs of
wear. kidneys often bring constant back-
ache, lame back, stitches and twinges of pain,
annoying urinary troubles, and the danger of
serious kidney disease. Doan s Backache Kidney
Pills are gratefully recommended by many aged
people. Read these Sydney testimonies.
CONVINCING PROOF FROM
SYDNEY.
A MAN’S CASE
Mr. Frederick Bradd, Crump Street,
Mortdale, Sydney, says: “I caught a
severe cold, which settled m my kid-
neys and caused severe backache. I
suffered intense pain, and could not
stoop or move about freely. I did not
know what to do to get ease, for the
remedies I used did me no good. See-
ing an advertisement for Doan s Back-
ache Kidney Pills led me to try them.
They gave me relief right from the
iirst dose, and in a short time I was
cured. I have no sign of backache
now, and attribute my cure solely to
Doan’s Backache Kidney Pills.”
Sixteen years later Mr. Bradd says:
“I have been free from backache since
Doan’s Backache Kidney Pills cured
me sixteen years ago. I am still a
great believer in this medicine, and
often take a few doses, as I think the
kidneys need a tonic sometimes.”
A WOMAN’S CASE
Mrs F. Osmond, No. S Gilbert
Street, Manly, Sydney, says: “I was
a martyr to backache, and the pain at
times was almost unbearable. I also
had several other distressing- symptoms
of kidney disorder, such as headaches,
dizzy feelings and sleepless nights. 1
was" always trying one remedy or
another, but derived no benetit Iroin
any of them. One day a friend urged
me to take a course of Doans Back-
ache Kidney Pills, and this medicine
proved to be the very thing I wanted.
There was a marked improvement alter
taking the first bottle, and by the time
I had finished three bottles of the_ pills
I was quite cured, all sign of backache
having disappeared entirely.”
Nine years later Mrs. Osmond says:
“I am still free of backache and kidney
trouble, and have been since Doans
Backache Kidney Pills cured me over
nine years ago.”

SYDNEY MAN CURED OF PILES BY
DOAN’S OINTMENT.
Mr. W. Solomon, Wentworth Street, Parramatta, Sydney, says: “About
20 vears ago-1 had a very severe attack of Itching and Bleeding Piles, and
underwent g an operation. I was right for about eight years and ■ then Bie
complaint returned. The agony was terrible. TSot wanting^
another operation, I started using Pile remedies. The number I used ”
astonish you, but they gave me no.benefit whatever. I.readlot Joans
Ointment eurimr others, and decided to give it a trial. Attei a tew appnca
lions I obtained B relief and one pot cured me. I always keep Doan s Ointment
in tL house! mul shall never be without it, for I know what a thoroughly
good remedy it is.”
- Ten years later Mr. Solomon says: “I have still the same good opinion
of Doan's' Ointment. It cured me of Piles many years ago, and I never
suffer with this complaint now.”

pigs, the calves, the fowls, the boots and the
cream separator for two days; going to bed
with a heart of bitterness and rising up with
curses not loud but deep.
On the afternoon of the second day he
saw Micky in the street, and choking down
his pride called him almost sweetly, striving
to hide his rage at the revolutionary infant.
“Ivem here, Micky, me lad.”
“Bonzer day,” said Micky, resolutely
keeping off the subject of strikes.
“ ’Tis, then. Now, look here, Micky,
when I tould you you could shtarrve I
didn’t mean a worrd uv it.”
.“Oh, forget it!” said Micky. “I am t
starvin’.”
“Ye dam’ little —niver moind. Now, Micky,
me lad, in industhrial disputes there
must be arbitration and conciliation. Now,
ye provide the conciliation —that s Labors
part. An’ me, bein’ Capital, will provide
the arbitration.”
“No good to me. I want a quid.” .
“Ye want! Ye’ll want hell, wont you?
Well, niver moind that. Now, Micky,
you’re Labor an’ I’m Capital. Now, who
fixes your wages, Micky?”
“I do.”
“You what? You fix your wages? You?
You dam’ little whipper-shnapper, you will,
will you?”
“That’s enough,” squeaked Micky, moving
off with great dignity. “Conference is
closed.”
“Micky, come back. Now, ye must know
y’r behavior is too impident. The confer-
ence is closed, is it?. ’Tis closed when I say
’tis closed!”
“I got me rights, Mister Deneen. . I
“Will you dliry up wid y’r rights? Now,
Micky, listen you to me, an’ I’ll listen to
you in a spirit of conciliation. Y’ve been
a good lad, Micky. Boots to see y’r face in,
and continted cows an’ pigs, an’ a clean
separator, an’ happy, happy chooks.”
He paused to see if praise, dear to the
soul of every artist, had its effect, or whether
it had been so thick as to be revolting flat-
tery ; but a glance at Micky reassured him.
Micky was eating it, yet not softening m
decision.
“Now, Micky, ye’ve been led away. One
of these Thrades Hall agitators have been
talkin’ class-consciousness to you—inshtimn
a feelin’ of hatred agin the mastlier class.
Micky, ’tis no good to you. Sowin’ the seeds
o’ dissinsion in th’ community is a bad
t’ing, an’ Socialism is agin’ the Empire—
an’ that’s the only good t’ing I iver heard
of Socialism. But take you no notice of
them Thrades Hall agitators who would take
away a man’s pigs an’ cut them up shquealin
an’ shcreamin’, to feed men that won t work
an’ say ‘T’ank you’ for the wages the kind
employer would give them. Come you out
wit’ them. Micky—come you out. We 11
now go into conference an’ go to arbithration
an’ conciliation. An I’ll be arbitlirator,
“No good to me.”
“No good to vou? Where's your concilia-
tion? Here’s my arbithration, but where s
your conciliation? Now, Micky, 111 give
you twelve shillin’s an’ sixpence ivery week
—niver the Satlierday night shall come wit -
out your takin’ your twelve shillin’s an’ six-
pence coin of the reallum firmly in your right
hand an’ goin’ home wit’ a thankful heart
and a grateful breath in your breaslit. There
you will be Satlierday nights—fifty-two
Satlierday nights in the year, Micky; an
twelve an’ six in your pocket, an Jimmy
Tyson wit’ a million cattle you’ll a
quick man could say ‘Crack.’ then.”
“Twelve an’ six is no good to me.
“No good to you ! Thafe of the worrld !
Pirate an’ bushranger an’ loafer —a bad end
you’ll come to. Out o’ me sight! I’ll see
you no more this side your funeral Out
wit’ you—vou dirty little impident Socialisht.
Shcum of the Thrades Hall agitators!”
“No good to me!” squealed Micky. ‘You
oughter get y’r head read; talkin’ like that,
an’ a J.P. an’ all. Take a pull at y self!
“Out wit’ you ! Out!”
“I’m out—in the road; an’ it’s my road.
Good-bye, Mister Deneen —take a pull at
y’self!”
Micky left his old employer choking.
For three days more Denny suffered phy-
sical discomfort as well as mental pain and
loss of dignity. He was now quite certain
that pigs, boots, fowls, calves and cream -
separators are inventions of the Devil, and
enemies of public and private peace. Came
a stage when he trampled on the remains ot
bis pride and watched for Micky for all of
one long day. But the strike was stronger
than ever. Micky refrained from showing
himself near that district of Quart Pot
devoted to Denny’s numerous businesses, but
instead sat at Strike Headquarters in per-
manent session.
But Denny could not face another day
of boots, pigs, fowls, calves and the cream-
separator, and in the deep violet night
whose field was sown thickly and care-
lessly with stars, Capital climbed the
hill and waited on Labor, hat in
hand. They had the conference in the
sitting-room —Micky’s mother sitting by, sew-
ing, a silent umpire prompting Micky with
winks and nods and lifting of the eyebrows.
“Now, Micky,” said Denny, making heavy
weather of the hated passage, “I come to
you wit’ an open moind. You have the Labor
an’ I have the Capital. An’ you have the
whip-hand o' me because Capital engaged in
perish’ble c’modities must conshider the loss
of sushpension of industhry. Boots must
have polish ; pigs an’ calves an’ crops is per-
ish’ble. an’ dirty separators is rust an hell.
Now. then, Micky, I’ll give you nineteen
shillin’s an’ shixpence a week, an a big, foine
pum’kin to take home wit you Satherdays.
I wouldn’t give you a pound a week if I liad
to kill the chooks an’ t’row the boots an’ the
pigs down the well; but nineteen shillin s
shixpence I'll give you and. a pum kin, .an
then* you'll he Satlierday nights wit nine-
teen shillin’s an’ shixpence in your pocket,
an’ a big pum’kin under your arrrm goin
home to your mother as proud as Billy-bc-
Damned.”
“Nineteen an’ six”
Micky looked at his mother, and Micky s
mother' flagged acceptance. “All right.
Mister Deneen,” said Micky. The strike s
off.”
“Bight, then; an’ good-bye to you, Mis-
thress. An’ come you out, Micky, into the
night for your instliructions.”
Mickv followed him from the house, and
Dennv stopped in the shadow of a gigantic
granite skittle and gripped Micky s shoulder.
“I have promised to give you nineteen
shillin’s and sliixpence an’ a pum’kin, Micky,
an’ I’ll keep me worrd. But let me hear
from you agin a worrd of raisin’ your wages,
an’ let you inshult me dignity agin be talkin'
in that Lord-King manner of callin’ the
shtrike off, and I’ll shtrike-off you so harrd
in the tail of your trousers wit’ me fut that
you’ll fall over the edge of the east where
the pigs root up the sunrise.”
“No good to me,” said Micky. Forget it.”
“You’re a good lad, Micky, an’ a good
mother to you. When you have anny more
indushtrial feelin’s, Micky, come to me an’
I’ll arbitrate agin.”
With his dignity restored in that he had
modified the striker’s claims. Denny went
down the starlit hill knowing that industrial
peace had come again to Quart Pot Creek.
RANDOLPH BEDFORD.
The Man with the Whistle.
[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
IT is a gracious thing to know that there
is a low cost of living in Sydney as
well as a high cost, and that the low
cost isn't at all discomfortable if you know
the ropes. The Man with the Tin-whistle
gave me a once-over of some of them in a
couple of excursions I made with him; and
others I have investigated for myself.
■ The Man with the Tin-whistle doesn't
work—-has retired, he says. After a good
night’s sleep he saunters forth to tootle for
breakfast. No legless soldier he; no uni-
form or subterfuge for such. Without choice
of stand he stops, and starts a merry lilt.
Pendant from his musical instrument (and
as lie plays it it is musical) is an Australian
or (mostly) a small Chinese dragon flag.
The Chow bannerette, he explained, draws an
inquisitive and payable crowd quicker than
the Australian device. Suddenly, in the
middle of a bar, he stops short and rings the
mob round from the hack with the hat. More
than breakfast, fags and a morning-glory
are always the result. After that, why worry
until the counter-lunch comes on at 10.30
(some houses) or 11 o’clock? Here he and
thousands less business-like have a wealth
of choice of food.
From all accounts Sydney isn’t anything
like it was in gone-by years in the way of a
free counter spread for the man who bought
a drink; but it’s no small potatoes to-day,
however you look at it. Nearly every house
has its distinctive menu and, naturally, a
more or less distinct class of customers
attracted by the particular feed offering.
Some houses, however, cater for all and sun-
dry. There is an old land-mark in George-
street where the table is laid in the sixpenny
bar at 10.30 a.m. Some of the hardened
habitues will tell you that there has always
been on the marble good, hot fried fish, hot
sausages, assorted sandwiches, corned beef,
crumbed cutlets, “German” sausages, salad
(celery, lettuce, shallots and radishes) and
bread. All you have to do is buy sixpence
worth of grog and eat your fill. The story
is told of one of the oldest and most until 1-
able customers that one morning, finding
that the crumbed cutlets had been forgotten
by some varlet, he stamped straight to the
manager’s office and threatened to withdraw
his patronage from the hotel if the default ever
occurred again. Apparently that put the
fear of God into the manager. Anyhow, the
cutlets and cutleteer are daily features of
the place.
But it isn’t with the high-grade bars we
are dealing, so we’ll pass along to some of
the “fourpenny joints” with our friend the
Man with the Whistle; by this time he has
done his little jig and stowed away his
flageolet and emblem of a busted dynasty.
The first port of call is another old land-
mark of the city. It has no sixpenny bar,
but the room where the drinks are served is
cosy and clean with its sawdusted floor,
shining bottles and burnished pots and pans.
In the corner two cauldrons are a-steam
side by side, and on a handy table are plates
and spoons. One of the pots contains a
stew (“Good as you could get on a magenta
mailboat,” affirms the musician) and the
other a soup. You can have soup, or you
can help yourself to stew, or you can have
a go at both of them, one after the other.
On the counter are bread, salads and slices
of big sausage. You do your worst with the
lot; there’s no stint nor any hint that a
fair thing for fourpence is a fair thing.
My friend assured me that a deadbeat,
say, could for four browns feed sufficient
into himself once a day to last him 24 hours,
and come again day after day and not a
word said about it. At that same caravan-
serai a similar banquet is set up again
between 5 and 6 p.m., so that on Bd. a day
and Is. for a bed (it can be got for less)
a week of six days could be got through com-
fortably for 10s. on the vital necessities.
On a quid a week you might do yourself
proud t j ie most bounteous fourpenny
counter-lunches is on the board in a pub
not far from the Trades Hall. Here you
can consume any of these or a helping ot
all of them: A big saucerful of boiled peas
or boiled peas and curry, corned beet,
sfiusftgo salad, sliced onions in vinegar and
bread. The way some of the men who rise
early and work hard in that locality put
a hole in the provisions is a treat to a man
who yawns over gin and truffles.
Another old licensed building, one of the
most ancient around Miller s Point, is famous
for the enormous meat-pie that keeps the
waterfront crowd quiet for a spell in between
blistering lies of stevedores and other ——s,
so-called in the friendly way of the ver-
nacular. There is a smgleahsh house, too,
on the Rocks. Curry and rice is that speci-
alty and many a man who takes a half-dollar
lunch and a half-tankard of lager as a mere
interruption of business or pleasure is fre-
quently run up there in Ins motor-car tor
a plateful of it—help yourself from the
tureens, and shell out 4d. Men who know
curry say it is curry; but it’s all the same
to the poor hungry bloke (and there are
too many of him in this city, which, on its
part is devouring the bowels out of. the
State) who by its solid, wholesome aid is
keeping his ribs from rattling as he runs.
