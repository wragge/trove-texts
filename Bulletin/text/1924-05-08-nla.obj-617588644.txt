The Poetry of Eileen Duggan
Maoriland is the most beautiful country
upon earth. Nature has given her color and
form, with every grace and every charm to
delight the eye and win the heart. She has
snowy mountains reaching up to the blue,
transparent sky, rolling hills, green and inti-
mate valleys, jthe space and freedom of open
plains; all these things are set in a
sea ever-changing under cloud or sun.
Nature has given her, too, a climate with
sufficient “tang” in it to set the blood flow-
ing swiftly and make movement a joy.
Finally she inherits the art and poetry, not
only of the dominant Anglo-Saxon race, but
also of their dusky-skinped forerunners, the
Maori. For Maoriland, like the older coun-
tries of the world, has its legends and its tra-
ditions. There are fairies hiding amongst the
flowers of the Bush—a merry people always
singing and laughing, and blue-eyed and
fair-haired like the pakeha. Then in deep
caves by the lakesides hide those hideous
monsters, those dragons known as Taniwha;
and everywhere throughout the islands
abound those mysterious presences the Atua.
There are gods and demi-gods in Maoriland,
and the same stories that Homer told appear
now and again in Polynesian guise. In short,
there is both the material and the setting for
a great poetry, though, so far, that great
poetry has not been produced in Ao-te-Rangi.
We are a practical rather than an imagina-
tive people, and our genius seems to express
itself more easily through science, and
through an orderly and healthy art
of living than through verse-making.
Alfred Domett remains our most outstanding
poet, and he was an Englishman. English,
too, are Arnold Wall and Blanche Baughan ;
while, so far, amongst the younger genera-
tion of the native-born, no one has done
better work than fiery-hearted Jessie
Mackay, or that fine artist, Arthur. Adams.
It is, therefore a great and unexpected
delight to read the 30 or 40 Poems by
Eileen Duggan contained in a modest paper-
covered volume published by The Tablet
Company, of Dunedin. • These lyrics, natu-
rally, are not all equally successful, but all
are worth reading, either for idea, or for
musical lilt, or for subtlety of workmanship.
And through them all runs emotional sin-
cerity which is the true mother of passion.
There are some amongst us who would have
us believe that passion is purely physical, of
the earth earthy—or' rather, of the flesh
fleshly. But surely passion is rather as a
burning flame, as a white light, which en-
velops any object and lends it unearthly
color. The most passionate sonnet in the
passionate Italian tongue was not addressed
to a woman. Art and emotion have no
homeland; they belong to every country.
But Eileen Duggan often uses as their sym-
bols the things that to her are homely, the
things that lie near at hand —the raupo in
the marsh, the singing tui, the golden kow-
hai of the bush —and she weaves them into
poetry with the silver thread of Celtic
imagination. Here is a verse from her
“Maori Lullaby,” with its suggestion of the
native karakia:—
Hush, oh hush, my little wild one.
Hekr the stirring in the hollow;
With thy restless little crying
Thou wilt wake the small sea-swallow.
Dearer than the bread of raupo,
Dearer than the sweet lconini,
Dearer than the dead to Tane,
Yea, so dear art thou unto me.
Sleep, my bud of Koromiko
Sleep, my wild karaka berry,
Sleep, my red-lipped rata-blossom,
Ate! Ate! Ate! Ate!
“The Broom” brings back a hundred memo-
ries of those savage Maoriland hills where
the wind sweeps across its golden masses and
scatters its perfume far abroad: —
Since thou hast set her body here
In exiled ways,
’Midst hills that fleer,
And since her soul, her gypsy soul,
Is all of hers that stays;
And even that on shadowed days
Must pitch its caravan
Far from Orangi, loved of gorse and man,
Nay, hear the whole!
Since here the grass lies brown in rings,
Nor cloud runs red,
Nor tui sings,
Above her lifted head,
Send thou to light her gloom
The knotted seeds of broom;
Its gold from every part
Will blow" into her heart
And be to her a dearer thing than bread.
Eileen Duggan has, however, wandered
further afield than Maoriland to gather
material for her poetry. “Yvonne” has a
French mediaeval setting, and “Rosa Luxem-
bourg” is a fine tribute to that wild,
intrepid woman who was butchered with
Liebknecht in Germany during those days
that were so vital, and seem now already so
far away:—
For some the shuttle leaping in the sun,
Laburnum leaves above the quiet door,
And song that drips like water, cool and slow,
And when the hands are still, and day is done,
The swaying crib upon the firelit floor —
Ah, how could you those gentle things forego?
For you no threaded spool, no singing time,
No young bees flying through laburnum boughs,
No little rolling head upon the breast,
But now, beyond the bourn of flower or chime,
May He who set the storm between your brows
Pity your broken bones and give them rest.
The most beautiful of her lyrics (though it
would have been improved by the omission
of one or two verses) is called “Sea
Prayers,” and begins, with Blake-like sim-
plicity, thus: —
God send a shining wind to blow
Upon a little town I know ... .
It is too long for full quotation. Here is,
instead, the tiny second verse of a tiny poem
called “The Poet” :
The peasant has shoes of wood—
Why are you shod with dreams,
Poor feet that wander here?
God makes His roads too sharp,
His stones too sheer,
For one whose shoes are dreams.
Aye, the road of the poet is rough and beset
with stones, and the feet of Eileen Duggan
arc surely shod with dreams. Yet she will
go along the difficult way singing to make
glad the hearts of those who hear her.
DORA WILCOX.
Padraic Colum
It would be difficult to imagine a more
alien figure in New York than Padraic
Colum, the Irish poet and dramatist, who
has just published his first novel. Coming
to Dublin as a young man from the centre
of Ireland in the early days of Abbey
Theatre, he was recognised at once by “A-.E.,’
W. B. Yeats and J. M. Synge as a poet with
something to say. They all felt sure of
Colum’s future. Synge, who seldom referred
to other writers, said at once that he would
arrive. Yeats thought that his early lyrics,
such as “The Plougher,” “The Drover, The
Poor Scholar” and “The Ballad Maker,
were charming; and “A.E.” wrote m his
extraordinary journal, the Homestead, which
mingled poetry and philosophy with agricul-
tural economics, that Colum s name would
some day be among the best-loved m Irish
literature. His first play, ‘ The Saxon Shil-
ling,” which he has never published, made a
stir in Ireland; and a little later Broken
Soil,” which he has since re-written as I lie
Fiddler’s House,” was selected with the
early plays of Yeats and Synge for perform-
ance in London as one of the representative
examples of the new Irish drama.
Colum, a country man himself, was closer
to the soil and the life of the fields and
villages than any other Irish writer. When
he wrote “Wild Earth, ’ his first book of
lyrics, he had never been to London, and
even Dublin he saw through innocent coun-
try eyes. Less aloof and aristocratic m his
outlook than either Yeats or Synge, he had
political as well as literary interests. He
even learned Gaelic, though, as it happened,
he never seemed able to master that lan-
guage, but he knew the ancient Celtic
legends and the fairy tales and folk-lore of
the country side. He was that rare bird m
modern literature, a real folk poet, with a
fresh and original note. A welcome figure
in the literary life of Dublin —eager, spon-
taneous, sympathetic, humorous, with a rare
charm of speech and manner —it was a curi-
ous turn of fortune that sent him to London
and later to the noisy, cosmopolitan world
of New York. Though he is obviously out
of place there, a country poet in the midst
of a mechanical civilisation, he speaks well
of the American people and is interested in
the development of American literature. In-
deed, he is now recognised as one of the
Republic’s foremost critics. His one fault
may be an excess of sympathy and gener-
osity, but this never affects his literary
judgment. His articles and essays, which
are only a small part of his work, have done
a great deal to raise the standard of Ameri-
can literary criticism.
Even in Fifth-avenue he was, when I
met him, still the Irish country poet. As
the automobiles whizzed past, “I had no
idea,” he remarked with a smile, “that there
were so many motor-cars in the world.”. lie
was most amusingly un-American in his in-
souciance and preoccupation. In the ele-
vated railway he would take from his pocket
a book of poems he was reviewing for the
New Republic, and quote some verses,
quite unconscious of the rattle of the train
and the gaze of the other passengers. But
he was not impressive in bearing. Small
and slight, he had no commanding presence,
and Americans judge a lot by appearance.
I remember going with him to see the final
rehearsal of his play called “Grasshopper,”
which was to be produced the next night at
the Garrick Theatre. The doorkeeper at
first refused him admission, and he had to
wait until the stage-manager appeared. He
was not a bit like a doorkeeper’s idea of an
author, certainly not an American author.
All Irishmen, except George Moore, are
speakers. I went one afternoon to the Prin-
cess Theatre to hear Colum deliver a lec-
ture on “The Democratic Movement in Irish
Literature.” He followed Wilfred Wilson
Gibson, who had given a reading of some of
his own poems, with comments. Colum is
no conventional orator, florid and flamboyant.
He strolls easily on ito the stage—an hour
late usually—and speaks quietly and inti-
mately as if to a few friends in a room. He
depends for his interest entirely on his mat-
ter. He began with a contrast between the
Celts and the Japanese. While the Japanese
had attained a national unity the Celts had
become a scattered race. He then traced
the modern development of Irish literature,
indicating its essentially democratic charac-
ter. “Let each man speak for himself!”
was the motto of the younger writers, who
favored the form of the dramatic monologue.
Yeats, a great poet and a great critic, had,
he said, restored the {esthetic element to
Irish poetry. Restored, not created it, for
the older Irish writers had recognised the
distinction between poetry and oratory which
in later times had become confused. He
quoted characteristic poems of “A.E.,”
Yeats, Douglas Hyde. O’Sullivan, James
Stephens and others, giving a simple explana-
tion of the distinctive character of Irish
prosody, and sometimes telling a good story
of one of his Dublin friends. Seumas O’Sul-
livan, a charming lyric poet and a prose
essayist superior to Stevenson, had just pub-
lished a new book. The next day Colum
met him in the street. “I’m going to get
your book,” he said. O’Sullivan shook his
head. “It’s withdrawn,” he replied; “I
didn’t like the look of the people who were
buying it, so I withdrew it.” Colum used
to dine every night at a little Italian cafd
called Moli’s, “the least Anglo-Saxon place
in New York,” he explained. One night
I heard him at the ’phone arranging about
a meeting of some Gaelic league, and he
ended with some fine-sounding Irish. I was
greatly impressed—till Mrs. Colum, who her-
self is a writer of distinction, said that they
were the only words he knew.
Folk writers are rare in America, and
Colum’s re-telling of many old Irish tales
gained him sufficient reputation to be selected
by the local government to go to Honolulu
to collect Hawaiian legends. These have
since been issued in two volumes by the
Yale University Press. His plays, which

LOUIS ESSON.
Adjectives that Are Not Padding
Harry Dean (R.P. 24/4/'24) declares that
the use of adjectives and adverbs is the hall-
mark of the second-rate poet, and attempts
to make his chse good by quotation from
Roderic Quinn and myself. In no case does
he show that the adjectives in the verses
quoted failed to carry the exact meaning;
and if he suggests that the passages would
have had the same meaning without the
adjectives his contention is obviously absurd.
But let us see what some of these second-
rate poets have been doing. Here are one
or two examples from that second-rater John
Milton: —
All the while sonorous metal blowing martial sounds.
Him the Almighty Power
Hurled headlong, flaming from the ethereal sky
With hideous ruin and combustion down
To bottomless perdition.
In notes, with many a winding bout
Of linked sweetness long drawn out,
With wanton heed and giddy cunning,
The melting voice through mazes running.
Terrible padding all this; though foolish
literary opinion has placed the lines quoted
as among the greatest in the language!
But that other second-rate poet, William
Shakspeare, is an equally bad offender. He
simply loads his verse on occasion with
adjectives—all quite unnecessary if they did
not happen to carry his meaning. Here
are three examples from his second-rate
sonnets: —
The humble salve which wounded bosoms fits.
The guilty goddess of my harmful deeds.
For precious friends hid in death’s dateless night.
Here is one shocking example from “Venus
and Adonis” :
Were I hard-favored, foul or wrinkled old,
111-nurtured, crooked, churlish, harsh in voice,
O’erworn, despised, rheumatic, and cold,
Thick-sighted, barren, lean, and lacking juice,
Then mightst thou pause.
All padding, mere padding, according to Mr.
Dean! The “Rape of Lucrece” has things
almost as bad :
What is the quality of mine offence,
Being constrained with dreadful circumstance?
May my pure mind with the foul act dispense,
My low-declined honor to advance.
In the plays the form does not lend itself
greatly to adjectival treatment; but, of
course, such a second-rater as Shakspeare is
bound to do some adjectival padding. Here
are some of the dreadful instances: —
The tyrannous and bloody act is done,
The most arch deed of piteous massacre.
—Richard HI.
The hollow passage of my poisoned voice.
—Henry VI.
1 do not think a braver gentleman,
More active-valiant or more valiant-voung,
More daring or more bold is now alive _
To grace this latter age with noble deeds.
—Henry IV.
Wherein X spoke of most disastrous chances,
Of moving accidents by flood and field,
Of hair-breadth ’scapes in the imminent, deadly breach.
— Othello.
What was’t
That moved pale Cassius to conspire? And what
Made the all-honored, honest Roman, Brutus,
To drench the Capitol ?
—Anthony and Cleopatra.
I had else been perfect;
Whole as the marble, founded as the rock,
As broad and general as the casing air:
But now I am cabin’d, cribb’d, confined, bound in
To saucy doubts and fears.
— Macbeth.
These examples will no doubt fairly estab-
lish the claims of Shakspeare and Milton to
the second-rate rank which Mr. Dean
awards to Roderic Quinn and myself.
But let us turn to Coleridge for a little
further light on the use of the adjective in
verse. By entirely ignoring the metre and
inserting a number of words, Mr. Dean tries
to show that Coleridge would have written
very badly if he had used some of my adjec-
tives. But what about leaving out his own
unnecessary adjectives in one of the loveliest
passages of the same poem. Take the stanza :
It ceased; but still the sails made on
A pleasant sound till noon,
A sound as of a hidden brook,
In the leafy month of June,
That to the sleeping woods all night
Singeth a quiet tune.
That treated in the Dean way would make:
It ceased; but still the sails made on
A sound till noon,
A sound as of a brook,
In the month of June,
That to the woods all night
Singeth a tune.
Mr. Harry Dean is quite entitled to his
opinion in these matters; what he is not
entitled to is the making of bald assertion
without explanation. Thus when he says
“foolish” is a “terrible bolster of a word,” I
want to know why. It exactly says the
thing I want to say; and without it the
thing could not have been said. The fact
that Mr. Dean might want me to say some-
thing else has nothing to do with the ques-
tion. Again, when he says “ ‘Pleasant’!
What a bump!” I may reasonably ask
where the bump comes in. The word is a
good one: it exactly carries the idea; it is
used in that sense by the acknowledged best
among our English writers. Mr. Dean’s
mode of criticism is utterly unfair in that
it suggests something which cannot, be main-
tained. Nothing would be easier than to
take any good line of any writer and say
“What a bump!” to some word in it. A bump
can only mean that there is some mental or
rhythmical irregularity which makes it diffi-
cult. Where does any such irregularity .
occur in my line
The' pleasant company of eager minds .
I can only conclude that the irregularity is
with Mr. Dean himself; and that the bump
is either in his hearing or his mental pro-

The over-use of adjectives is a thing to oe
objected to on general grounds, not because
there is anything wrong with the adjectives
themselves, but because an idea is less
sharply conveyed by them than by the use
of nouns and verbs. But that is one of the
very reasons why their use is often neces-
sary in poetry. Frequently the sharpness of
an idea is not the thing to be aimed at. Ihe
writer does not desire an angular statement
in black and white, but uses the color and
roundness of the adjective to carry tne
thought which is beyond expression m nouns
and verbs. In plain fact, any and every use
of language is fair in verse if the verse-
maker can say what he wants to say. Verse
thought is rhythmical, and many ol our
finest rhythmical words are adjectives, let
because I use those words Mr. Dean accuses
me of ‘-padding.” Padding, I should say,
means the introduction of words and phrases
which have no real relation to the. thing
which is said. My critic has not given a
single instance in which I have done this;
he has not shown that my writing is more
adjectival than that of tin; acknowledged
masters of English verse: he has not been at
pains to find out by comparison that it is
generally less adjectival than that ot most
modern writers.
DAVID McKEE WRIGHT.
A Late and Never Victorian
Some of us know H. H. Asquith only
as an ex-Prime Minister who frequently
considered it better to be never than
But others will remember him as a graceful
historian and essayist whose style endea-
vors to conceal a classical education. In
Studies and Sketches (Hutchinson) he re-
veals himself standing poignantly at the
death-beds of various literary and political
eras that, if not superior to, were at least
different from, ours. With a bowed head he
watches the last moments of the Victorian
age, and while placing a wreath of immor-
telles on its clammy brow looks back at the
men and women who proved that it had
taken an old lady’s name in vain. Belong-
ing to it and an ornament of it, he talks
of the epoch as if it were a coup by the
Omnipotent after icons of pardonable inactiv-
ity. Perhaps it was a wonderful time.
With his passion for turning dates into data,
he alludes lovingly to the stretch, 1809-1819,
which must be the golden decade of genius.
In 1809 Darwin, Gladstone and Tennyson
were born : in 1811 little Makepeace Thack-
eray saw the light; next year heard the first
cries ot’ Charles Dickens, while tiny Robert
Browming was caught in the throes of try-
ing to say something; a gap to 1816 and
then Charlotte Bronte was lustily squealing
for her future; three years more and George
Eliot, Buskin and Charles Kingsley pre-
vented Victoria having 1819 all to herself.
Mr. Asquith speaks of them and the others
who came after with the just appreciation
of one who has had the opinions of his con-
temporaries to confirm his judgments. He
is comfortably complimentary to the writers,
thinkers and scientists, but, like many more
learned gentlemen, he is uneasy on the sub-
ject of Art. So he “will only venture a
word” on the art of “the Victorians.” and
when he declares that “an age which pro-
duced Millais and Watts, and in a later
generation Frederick Walker and Cecil Law-
son, can never (to put it at the lowest) be
treated as a barren interlude in the annals
of the English School of Painting,” he simply
scurries for safety behind a hazy generalisa-
tion. He might just as well have remarked
that the people who produced the ukulele
are not entirely unmusical, or that the onion
hasn’t the meanest place in the vegetable
kingdom. In this passage the essayist’s
“word” is too little —and too much. In
other parts of his very readable volume he
inspects the religious and other frenzies of
the eighteenth century, and contributes a
delightful chapter on Dr. Johnson and
Fanny Burney. Then there are some
opinions on Tacitus, who, despite “his tricks
of style,” yet “handles the Latin language
in a manner and with an effect entirely be-
yond the reach of his contemporaries.” Else-
where we are whisked away to the “age of
Demosthenes” ; we learn the writer’s views
on Joseph Chamberlain and Campbell Ban-
nerman, and are presented with the sub-
stance of an address at Eton on “Reading
and Writing.” This opens with an
allusion to the author of “Coningsby,” who
“had not the advantage of being educated
here.” It seems a belated slap, but Dis-
raeli wouldn’t have resented it. Was it not
he who remarked somewhere that many a
Prime Minister was lost on the playing-fields
of Eton?
C.R.B.
“In Their Own Country”
It is deplorably true, as protested by G. 0.
Dixon (R.P. 10 ,/4/’24), that Australian
daily newspapers publish a lot of slushy
imported fiction to the neglect of the better
work of native writers. But all the blame
for that is not rightly to be put on to the
proprietors. A large share of it belongs
to what an exasperated Frenchman called
the ignorant pig of a public. Most of the
people who read newspaper serials like
slush. I know of one suburban rag which
remained alive for no reason that was
imaginable until it developed that the women
of the neighborhood took it in because they
“liked the tale.” the same tale being invari-
ablv either a sickly “love story” or a rub
bishy “romance,” usually scissored out of
some other rag. Sydney papers have tried
home and outside authors of quality, and
been discouraged from keeping on trying.
Ethel Turner is about the biggest seller, all
round, among Australian novelists. The
D.T. has published some of her best books, but
none of them ever made the circulation-
needle wag a bit faster. It was the same
when the paper took on other authors of
recognised worth —Besant, A. E. W. Mason
and Phillips Oppenheim, for instance. If
the readers showed any delectable prefer-
ence, it was for the sloppier stuff of the
cheaper craftsmen.
As for the short story, one paper tried
to encourage home writers by publishing
nothing but their work. The outcome was
not encouraging. Many stories were received
and many used, but 9t) per cent, of them
might have been written in Stoke-on-Pogis
or Keokuk for all the distinctiveness they
showed in theme or expression. A big pro-
portion were atrociously Yankee, teeming
with “the copious Corinthian baseness of
the American reporter.” To have published
these would have been to pander to that
seeming desire of some Australians to be-
come what TAe Bulletin editorially
abhorred the other day as “a nation of syn-
thetic and second-class Yanks.” Also it
would have been dangerous, for the further
reason that only an editor debased into
wallowing in Yankee fiction of the lowest
degree could have protected himself against
abetting theft by some equally degraded
native pirate. Stevenson has defended and
even championed the practice of imitating
great writers as a useful way of acquiring
a literary style of one’s own, but it seemed
to that editor that the Lord had delivered
his servant into the hands of a class of copy-
ists who, having picked the worst model,
had been permanently arrested at the imitat-
ing stage. Probably there are two reasons
for this —(1) that one or two Australian
papers have acquired command of all the
sliort-story purveyors who can write, and
(2) that, owing to the mushiness of the
present-day English short-story, Australian
mimics have been attracted by the picture-
show flashiness of the American article.
After its dreary inanity, what outstands
from the typical newspaper serial is its
popularity. More than one daily journal
has tried" to drop it, mainly for economical
reasons. Not so much to save the price,
which is inconsiderable. A long story can
be bought from an agency for such a paltry
sum that for anything over £lO super-stuff
is expected—deeds of blood and mystery cal-
culated to make the feminine hair curl, or
love-making so hectic that it scorches the
begonias, as when George Ade’s Rupert Ban-
siford led Sybil Gray into the conservatory.
So that the fee needn’t fidget even the flin-
tiest flint-skinner. But “the tale” takes up
a column or more per day, and space i. s*
worth money. Yet at each attempt to cut
it out, subscribers have risen in mass and
intimidated the newspaper with threats of
no story no subscription. Accordingly, the
serial has been continued. And as the cus-
tomers obviously prefer tripe, tripe it is.
H.J.T.
“Brian 0. Fitzpatrick”: I do not wish to discount
the truth of anv of the facts upon which “J.8.D.”
bases his pessimism (R.P. 10/4/’24). I only deny
their cogency. There have surely been instances
enough in history of the power of the better part of
human nature to overcome the worse to make an
enumeration quite unnecessary to the informed. For
example, I objected to the very sweeping assertion,
“society lacks the will to be Christlike,” not because
I thought for one moment that society is Christlike
(as “J.8.D.” truly says, that would be blasphemous),
but because I believed, and still believe, that society
can become Christlike. And, indeed, that is the only
view to take. If society can never improve, if pro-
gress is an illusion, life is not worth living, and all
philosophy, all hope, all thought, all service, all that
is true and beautiful and good, must be discarded
as illusory and unreal. If “J.B.D.’s” eye perceives
“cant and humbug masquerading as idealism” in
my expression, his vision passes understanding, and
I could wish that philosophical jaundice were a
complaint less epidemic among those who to
call themselves students of life. It is a far beMei
thing to be a True Believer, whether one’s belief
centre in Mahomet, or the Ideal, or the eternal
truths of philosophy, than it is to be a weary sceptic
mocking at all things human and divine. Let us
recognise, by all means, in “J.B.D.’s” words, “Uat
in the mass we are predatory, selfish and not particu-
larly honest,” but let us recognise too that there is
in the world a force making for the betterment
of the world ; and of that force —call it a spiritual
principle, or the Form of the Good, or what you will
—the harness is Education.
“C.0.M.”: No book by an Australian has been
pushed off with so good a word from its publishers
as “Daughters of the Seven Mile,” a Queensland
novel by Zora Cross. Under the heading “A Wonder-
ful First Novel,” Hutchinson and Co. declare it to
be “among the few contemporary novels destined to
go down to posterity as a classic.” And further:
“Several well-known critics who read the original
MS. are astounded at its originality, its daring, its
deep sympathy with the fundamental passions of
men and women.” They add that they “have seen
nothing like it for many years” and that it “stands
apart from other novels of to-day.”
“0.K.M.”: Anna T. Brennan (R.P. 17/4/’24) seems
to regard psycho-analysis as a sinister move in
the direction of corrupting the morals of the young,
whereas it is simply a method of medical treatment
for the mentally afflicted. Freud has done great
work in opening up for psychology vast regions
of the “unconscious” mind hitherto unexplored, ite
has shown that dreams, for example, are actually
disguised expressions of the subconscious intelligence
welling up into the conscious life. Each dream has
its manifest content, the chain of absurd, fantastic
and unreasonable events and actions which we re-
member on waking; but underlying this superficial
jumble is a wholly rational content comprising our
desires and thoughts concerning matters in which
we feel vital interest. A dream, says Freud,
always represents the fulfilment of a wish,
and, fantastic and meaningless as the dream-fulfilment
may appear, it is there in a disguised form, since
“disguises are necessary to enable the dream to pass
the censor.” The outcome of this conflict between
desire and will-power, resulting in the repression ci
a strong wish or desire, is nervous disorder, and it
is this type of disease which Freud’s method sets out
to cure. The Freudian over-insistence on the import-
ance of the sexual factor may be a Tittle unpleasant,
but never let it be said that psycho-analysis means
nothing more than this.
The latest number of Art in Australia contains a
reproduction of Victoria’s National War Memorial,
and several of the Archibald Prize pictures of the
year But the most inspiring feature to the Aus-
tralian inkv-wayfarer is the announcement that a
£5O prize is waiting for the best 3000-word story
that reaches the Sydney office of the magazine inside
three months.
The April issue of the Australian Museum
Magazine is one of the most readable numbers to
date; with such articles as “Wild Life m the Mallee,
by Charles Barrett; “Ana Island,” by Capt. Pitt
Rivers • “Some Australian Insects Injurious to Man, ?
by Anthony Musgrave; “Cannibalism Among Snakes,
by J R. Kinghorn: “Boomerangs, by \\. W. Thorpe ,
and so on. A fine lot of illustrations go with the
letterpress. There is a melancholy interest in the
editor’s plea for more funds for the Museum,
which is hopelessly short of space, has to stow
priceless stuff away in cellars, and has no chance
of doing continuous field-work, which is the very
life of an institution of this kind.

CUT DOWN YOUR HOT-WATER BILL
Appreciation
I
AN “IDEAL” OWNER WRITES:—
“Dear Sirs, —
“Some little time ago you sup-
plied me with, and went to some
trouble to advise me regarding the
installation of, your ‘ldeal’ Hot
Water Service. After six months’
experience I wish to say that I am
obtaining the utmost satisfaction.
I have the system connected up with
two plunge baths, two showers, two
hand basins, kitchen, two tubs, and
copper. We are never short of
really hot water at any point at
any time. We only stoke twice a
day (morning and night), the Are
never goes out, and the trouble in-
volved is not worth considering.
The amount of fuel used—Gas Co.’s
Breeze—is one bucket per 24 hours,
a running cost of under 1/- per
week. Of course there is a very con-
siderable saving in the gas bill, as
hot water is literally always on tap
and used liberally throughout the
house.’!
Now that an efficient hot-water supply is practically obligatory
in establishments patronised by the public, it is good business
to instal a system known to be effective and economical on
five continents.
The Ideal independent hot-water boiler is heated by coke,
and supplies hot water to as many baths, basins and sinks as
required. There is always hot water at the taps when required
by guests and servants.
Ideal * [deal
1 Radiators 1 Boilers
The “Ideal” Boiler requires little attention, and the saving
per week compared with other systems soon pays for the boiler.
Where soft water prevails “Ideal” Boilers can be supplied
treated to supply water free from rust. “Ideal” Boilers used
in conjunction with “Ideal” Radiators provide the cheapest
central heating system available. With this system the average
cost of heating an ordinary-sized room is less than one penny
for 24 hours. Whether it’s a heating or a hot-water system
required, first investigate the “Ideal” and get a price for an
installation.

It has been the unvarying policy of the Packard
Company, for twenty four years, steadily to im
prove its products.
In pursuance of this practice, it is our privilege to
announce a new model of the Packard Single-Six,
including many important uew featnres ana
refinements.
A New and Improved Model of the
Famous Single-Six
IN the fundamentals of Single-Six engineering
and manufacture, we agree that no desirable
changes are possible.
We recognise, however, in four-wheel brakes, an im-
portant advance in motor car design.
In fact, Packard Straight-Eight was the first promi-
nent American car to carry four-wheel brakes as
regular equipment.
From this time, all Packard cars will be equipped
with four-wheel brakes, and two additional brakes
on rear wheels, a total of six.
To ensure greater durability, long life and economy
of upkeep, the new Single-Six is provided with a
newly designed and heavier transmission. It is ex-
ceptionally quiet and smooth in operation.
Artillery type wheels of heavier construction contri-
bute enhanced appearance.
To make the battery more accessible, it has been
located on the the running-board, as in the Straight-
Eight, and enclosed in a theft-proof box.
There are several important refinements in regular
equipment, including:
Petrol gauge on the instrument board.
The use of adjustable window regulators
on the rear windows of Sedans and
Sedan-Limousines.
The adoption of an efficient stop-light
for all cars.
Larger steering wheel.
A more beautiful instrument board,
with walnut finish.
An interior tonneau light for all open
models.
Toilet cases, smoking sets for closed cars.
The brilliant beauty of design and color, which has
made the Single-Six the most notable—and the most
imitated — car on the market, remain unchanged.
With these important improvements, the Packard
Single-Six is, in our opinion, an even more out-
standing value than in the past.

Inconstant.
My heart, beloved, has been false to you:
For all alone this morning while you slept
I watched the first pale sunbeams as they
crept
Slantwise amid the trees, and saw the dew
Wake in a million points of light. A few
Small sleepy birds were chirping; and love
swept
Across my heart and thrilled it, and I wept,
As once before, and was a bride anew.
Let me, belovSd, fling my heart away.
The earth is lovely beyond human speech —
To lie on the warm grass and feel the breath
Of apple-blossom faintly scent a day
Still young! ’Tis then my instincts teach
That Beauty reigns—and after Beauty
Death.

Ars Ignota.
All sights or sounds that move the human
heart
By ear are caught or rifled with a look.
Breen-bannered boughs, the treble of a brook.
The arrowy glances loving women dart,
Issue again in works of conscious art,
Shaped, sounded, painted, symbol’d in a
book;
But sweets distilled in some rich flowery
nook.
Inviolate, have no such counterpart.
My delicate-greedy sense, inspired to thieve
When lily-virgins and expectant 'grooms
Whisper together at the marriage-pve.
Would steal the breath of these delicious
blooms
That I from deft similitudes might weave
In floating scents a sonnet of perfumes.

The Leaning Storm.
One storm is on the northern hills,
And one upon the plain ;
And all between through sunlight spills
A shining golden rain.
A rainbow spans the valley green.
And o’er the mild wet air
The nearing thunder seems to lean
To reach a place so fair.
Thus, leaning over Paradise,
The great sword-angel stood
Watching the fruit that was the price
Of peace and human good.
Doom to the north, doom to the south,
Flame on the sword’s red steel!
Joy on a woman’s raptured mouth—
The serpent at her heel!

My Ladye.
Rose-leafed rustle of clinging gowns!
What is my Ladye wearing?
She the belle of the brilliant towns,
She of a gracious bearing!
Shimmering satin? Old brocade?
Cloth of a peacock’s feather?
How do they stroll on the balustrade,
She and her love together?
Is she in jade or marble white
With lips as red as coral?
Hist! A cry on the flowery night!
Do she and her lover quarrel?
I see the light of a hundred eyes—-
The gems on her fingers, maybe;
I hear a voice that is sooth and wise,
For Life is a fine, fine ladye!
She wantons far in a place apart
From Time her constant lover;
And the secret she holds in her roving heart
He will never discover.
For there is one that she would pursue—
How long will he evade her?
She flirts with the point of a jewelled shoe
And mocks the gods that made her.
Sweet as a rose is her perfumed breath.
What is my Ladye wearing?
Waxen she lies in the arms of Death,
Naked and past all caring.
VICTORIA.

A Tarantelle.
Superb is ray Lady in tissue of gold
And ropes of rare pearls her white bosom
enfold,
Embracing her. lacing her beauty of mould.
My Lady would walk on the terrace with me
Where cluster red roses and poises the bee.
Trifling and rifling the nectar with glee.
My Lady would flirt; and with consummate
grace
Waves her fan of fine silvery, cobwebby lace,
Concealing, revealing her beautiful face.
My Lady would dance. Oh, her small, lat-
ticed feet
On half-Louis heels keep the music's soft
beat.
Beguiling and smiling with lips scarlet-
sweet !
My Lady is weary and stifles a sigh.
I lead her where glimmers a bright starry
eye
Which lingers where fingers like butterflies
lie.
While Night brushes moonbeams from cut
her long hair.
I murmur rny passion in ears that are fair
And willingly, thrillingly float upon air.
O flowers embalmed by the delicate dew.
I’ve kissed the dear eyes of my Lady-love
true;
And listen: they glisten like stars in the
blue!

DISCRIMINATORY LAWS.
The hallmark of all ultra-righteous legisla-
tion of a prohibitive nature is its tendency
to discriminate against the less fortunate.
The legislator, if he is to be judged by his
deeds, looks upon the working and middling
classes as irresponsible beings, half fools* half
knaves, who must be shielded from the results
of their evil inclinations. The capitalist is
of finer clay. He can be trusted not to over-
do things in the drinking, gambling or any
other line; and the richer he is the more the
State is justified in leaving him to his own
devices. This convention flourished at the
beginning of last century, when wealthy
M’s.P. did much of their work for the nation
in a condition of more or less blind-drunken-
ness, and when the gambling that went on at
White’s, the Cocoa Tree and other resorts of
the nobility and gentry shocked Europe;
it was transferred to Australia with so many
other British institutions, and is with us
still. It is permissible for those who can
afford the expense of a day at Flemington or
Randwick to gamble in thousands: the fan-
tan or two-up player is guilty of a punish-
able offence. The street prostitute is liable
to arrest as a vagrant; her equally dangerous
sister who is too affluent to be “known to the
police” may pursue her calling unchecked
till thq inevitable day when she gravitates
downwards and joins the class that is looked .
on coldly by the Law. Nowhere, however, is
the rule that it behoves the State to devote
all its energies to keeping the poor virtuous
while neglecting the morals of the rich more
in evidence than in liquor legislation and its
administration. In some of the big cities of
the Commonwealth the situation amounts to
a travesty on justice and equity, is turning
good citizens into law-breakers, and is damag-
ing the country in a material sense as well.
It is safe to say that 6 o’clock closing has
caused more illegality amongst people who
respect the law in its other aspects, more
irritation amongst those who have been deniei
the chance to break the liquor laws by lack
of means, and more joy to professional
fomenters of strife than any one other ordi-
nance of the past half-century. In some of
the States which adopted it it has been
modified ; in N. S. Wales the way it works
out is, in the first place, that any restaurant
which pays the Treasury nothing by way of
licensing fees may have as much liquor on
its tables after the fateful hour as it pleases,
provided the diners have ordered it before-
hand or are so well-known to the manage-
ment as to make that formality unnecessary.
But a first-class hotel which pays close on
£BOOO a year in licensing fees may not supply
a drop of drink after six under any circum-
stances except to persons resident there.
Now, no modern hotel can live by lodgers
alone. There are periods when it is almost
empty. In order to get back from the swings
the losses on the roundabouts, and maintain
an efficient staff and a due standard of com-
fort year in year out, it has to look to an-
other trade. An important item here is the
restaurant business. If the whole city were
teetotal after 6 o’clock the position of the
licensed houses might not be so disastrous;
but in point of fact no city is anything of
the sort, and it is right and natural that this
should be so. If man is to drink at all (and
very few T British communities have so much
as attempted to do without alcohol) it is best
that he should do it with his meals, and of
all meals the one most suitable for the pur-
pose is dinner, which by a very large propor-
tion of the inhabitants of Australia is taken
after six. An effect of a strict reading of
the 6 o’clock rule has been to practically
empty the restaurants and dining-rooms of the
licensed houses, great and small. The diner-
out of means (one who has no objection to
spending a couple of pounds on a meal for
himself and his Avife) is not inconvenienced.
He transfers his patronage to a restaurant
which enjoys the advantage of being without
a license. As a quaint example of the boon
that this represents, a leading hotel in one
of the big cities has built an annexe in which
dinners and luncheons are served. A hole
in the wall between annexe and hotel would
inflict a license on the former, so waiters
dodge round a screen with liquid refresh-
ments, and the legal requirements of a Gil-
beptian State are met. Elsewhere the lave is
evaded by one of the diners (veho may or
may not be the host, but who serves in that
capacity for legal purposes) taking a room
for the night, and so becoming technically
entitled to buy liquor. But comparatively
few, even in this loan-enriched land, can
afford such costly meals and subterfuges,
and in consequence , thousands go thirsty
every night whose tempers and digestions
would be all the better —to make no men-
tion of the revenue—for a modest stimulant.
* * * *
The big hotel is hit hardest, on the whole.
Its rivals in the restaurant business are
able to outbid it as regards waiters, chefs,
foodstuffs and so on, for their meal charges
are usually higher and their profits on drinks,
since they pay no licensing charges, are
always so. This causes deterioration in the
hotel as an accommodation-house. Old
patrons begin to find the waiting and attend-
ance generally not so good, and turn to
boarding-houses where, in many cases, drink
can be had at all hours by almost any-
body. And with every such defection the
deterioration of the hotel increases. Most
of the smaller hotels have gone out of the
dinner-providing business altogether, so far
as the general public are concerned. They
frankly cater for their handful of lodgers,
and let casual seekers after meals know
that they are unwelcome. The type of re-
spectable though far from affluent suburban-
ite who used to visit their dining-rooms in
pre-war days is not in a position to send
special messengers by day with consignments
of liquor to the only class of unlicensed rest-
aurant he is in a position to patronise, nor
is he able to secure reservations of alcohol
over the telephone. So the more modest eating-
houses have practically given up attempting
to supply drinks with meals. This is no
triumph for temperance, however. Sly-grog-
shops, licensed and otherwise, provide the
liquor at all hours which, under a rational
system, dining-rooms would be legally en-
titled to serve _ during meal hours, and no
shame is felt either by those who break the
law or by those who are caught breaking it.
In most cases, in fact, it is considered a
commendable action to show the tyrants in
authority that the down-trodden poor are
not prepared to let the rich monopolise all
the amenities of life.
- * * *
The remedy for a glaring social evil is
the institution of meal licenses. Without
them our hotels will develop more and more
into mere attachments to bars—seedy and
understaffed places having no more accom-
modation than is imposed on them by law,
and showing would-be guests that they are
reluctant purveyors of even that much.
Without them one class of unlicensed rest-
aurant will make huge profits, from which
the State will not benefit to the extent of
a shilling, by selling the socially prominent
all the strong drink the latter want, while
another class will sell nothing in its dining-
room but all that its customers care to de-
mand in the back yard—-again without any
profit to the State. A license to sell drinks
with meals between stated hours should be
given to all hotels and to any restaurant of
repute. It would, of course, be separate
from and superimposed on the ordinary bar
license, thereby denying the hotel an unfair
advantage over the restaurant, which fulfils
an urgent public need at present, and which
is going to be in greater demand than ever
as the Servant problem grows with intensi-
fication of our free educational policy. The
nation would benefit vastly from this reform,
not merely in licensing-fees, but in improved
morale, in bettered health (a matter of less
sly, which is to say inferior, drinking) and
in the saving implied by diminished police
activities. There is nothing at all to be
said for the existing arrangement except from
the standpoint of those who are concerned
to turn the evasion of the law of the land
into an act of heroism —a section that no
country can afford to encourage these days.
THE OCCIDENTAL BULL AND THE
CELESTIAL CHINA SHOP.
China is at present in one of her periodical
crises of disturbance. Missionaries are being
chased out of their missions, foreign property
is destroyed by brigands, foreign ships are
seized and pillaged by pirates, and civil war
is affecting foreign business. The central
Government is impotent, and all that can
bo expected from it in the way of repara-
tions is an expression of polite regret. In
these circumstances it is only natural that
the hoary cry for intervention should be
raised anew. It is an ancient remedy which
lias been proposed before, and has even been
tried in a modest way. It is an attractive
remedy because it appeals to the Occiden-
tal’s temperamental belief in the efficacy of
force in dealing with the pacific Oriental—
the same belief that makes a planter kick
an argumentative coolie. It also appeals to
the Occidental love of loot. There were
pretty pickings for generals as well as pri-
vates in the Boxer business. There are
pretty pickings for nations as well as indi-
viduals in this one. A little European nation
like Portugal, if she joins in with a file of
soldiers and a sergeant, may pick up a rich
province, with a population of 70 millions,
like Szechuan. A nation which prefers dip-
lomacy, alias treachery, may, by ratting on
her sister nations, obtain valuable conces-
sions. There v are perfectly unspeakable
eventualities which might eventuate. A
world war. for instance, or a Bolshevik China
allied with Soviet Russia, both armed to
the teeth by way of Germany.
Four hundred years ago Antonio Galvan
proceeded to Tidore, and with 400 men, 170
of whom only were Portuguese, attacked the
allied princes of the Moluccas, whose army
amounted, by the Portuguese computation,
to 30,000, and defeated them, killing the
King of Ternate and losing but one Portu-
guese slave. The advocates of intervention
in China visualise the enterprise as a sort
of butchers’ picnie of that nature. They
forget that times have changed, and that the
art of scientific murder has become inter-
nationalised. They forget that their busi-
ness friends are busily engaged in teaching
Chinese generals how to make the very latest
kind of poison gas. Antonio Galvan’s
famous victory was probably won by sheer
prestige. The superstitious Oriental ran at
the mere appearance of the terrible white
men. To-day the European’s prestige is very
nearly nil in China. His moral prestige
never was of. any consequence, but after
Britain’s various little wars over opium and
other things, the Chinese realised that “the
white ape” had, by some illegitimate means,
acquired the use of weapons far beyond
his intellectual deserts. That only lasted
till the Japs destroyed the legendary power
of Russia. After that tremendous feat be-
came known in the bazaars of Asia, the white
man’s stock fell once more to zero.
Intervention is a very different proposition
to-day from what it was when the Boxers
rose armed with spears and bows and arrows,
and fortified with gymnastic exercises which
were supposed to grant the gymnast immu-
nity from foreign bullets. The future Boxer
will probably perform his mystical eurhyth-
mies in bombing ’planes. The intervention-
ist* forgets that China has been busily occu-
pied in militarising herself since 1912. To-
day her regular army probably amounts to
more than a million and a half, and her irre-
gular armies and her locust-cloud of bandits
amount doubtless to as many more, Some
of the units of the regular army are as effi-
cient as any European corps. They have
aeroplanes and motor transports. Feng Ytr-
hsiang, the Christian general, and Wtx Pei-
Fu, the Chinese king-maker, are clever stra-
tegists who have been fighting off and on
for the last 12 years. The smuggling of arms
into China is the profitable industry of Euro-
pean firms of high repute. It probably
began 50 years ago, and has been going on
ever since. There are in consequence vast
numbers of rifles, good, bad and dangerous
to their owners, ready for use in China; and
the bandit pest has compelled hundreds of
little villages all over the country to organise
in their own defence. Even if the foreign
Powers were able to adopt a common policy
towards China and keep to it for a fortnight
at a time, they would require, not an expedi-
tionary force, but a large army to subjugate
such a country. They would be embarking
on a campaign the end of which no man could
foretell. They might be providing the stimu-
lus required to weld the immense population
of 400 million people into a national entity.
Stimulus from outside has done such things
before to-day.
There is another aspect of the question not
without interest to Australia. Talking re-
cently in Java with Chinese merchants and
students, and reading their vernacular papers,
I got the impression of an awakened national
spirit. Like most colonies in alien countries,
the East Indian Chinese are more patriotic
than the home populations. There are
800,000 of them, and they form the wealthi-
est section of the people, not excepting the
Dutch themselves. Those European Govern-
ments which harbor under their protecting
wing large Chinese communities—like
France in Cochin China, Britain in
the F.M.S., and the Dutch in Java—
should think twice before starting too non-
chalantly on a career of intervention in
China, lest they stir up a hornets’ neSt in
their own colonies.
Constructive solutions, involving sacrifices
on both sides, are not attractive to the advo-
cates of intervention. The crux of China’s
problem is, of course, finance. No Govern-
ment can be expected to function properly
when its Treasury is yearly emptied to pro-
vide the interest on foreign loans, advanced
by unscrupulous concession-hunters to irre-
sponsible subordinates. No Government can
be expected to retain its prestige when this
year’s generals, who may be next year’s ban-
dits, are able to pledge the resources of the
country in order to maintain their own revolt
against the central authority. There is
room, too, for modification in the Western
attitude to China on the social question. No
Government as weak as China’s should be
asked to extend protection over its vast
dominions to every foreign missionary who
cares to engage himself in preaching ethical
Bolshevism in any lisien, fu or chia he likes.
When the missionary informs the Chinese
that the worship of their ancestors and their
devotion to their mothers-in-law are sins
against the Holy Ghost, he should be pre-
pared for trouble; and when trouble comes
his way, according to the tenets of his own
faith he should not claim the protection of
foreign bayonets. The Powers should make
tlm clear to all the missionary bodies.
The removal of some of these points of
friction and the lightening of the burden of
indemnities incurred by the ignorance and
folly of former absolute rulers would help
to mollify the situation. The ..demand for
intervention has, however, the stronger back-
ing, and because of its dire potentialities it
deserves the closest attention. The Euro-
peanisation of the most pacific nation in the
world, whose people could be recruited in
their myriads for aggression of their neigh-
bors, is an eventuality too horrible to con-
template. It might well be the beginning
of that militarisation of Asia from which
Australia particularly has most to fear.
FENG-SHUI.
PLAIN ENGLISH.
The Levy on Capital.
The craving for a “levy on capital,” or a
“levy on wealth,” has got into the soul of a
section of Australian Labor also, and is be-
ing chattered about by all manner of ama-
teurs in all manner of corners. A few hold
in a general way that it wouldn’t damage
industry. Others hold that it would and want
it to, these being professional damagers pure
and simple, with an instinct for prowling in
search of valuable pickings among the ruins
of civilisation. The levy has recently been
tried in Russia; and as it was accompanied
with a repudiation of all foreign debt, it
should have been a success there, if it was
likely to be anywhere. It wasn’t exactly a
triumph. Turkey has had it ever since the
Turk eventuated —especially Asiatic Tur-
key, where Abdul Fez has been longest and
been strongest. The levy is simply a spas-
modic exaction, which may happen once, or
may become a habit and happen at irregular
intervals. It happens irregularly in the
Turk's country, wherefore no one, save a
foreigner who occasionally takes the risk,
feels it worth while to have much capital,
and rags and hovels are the customary dis-
guise. The scheme was mooted once by the
Socialist party in Switzerland, and the
struggle to remove portable wealth and shift
portable businesses out of the country gave
the place a shock from which it was slow
in recovering. The referendum squashed the
proposed Swiss levy flat beneath an over-
whelming majority. Australia has no refer-
endum, and shows no sign of getting one.
Labor has long since ceased to desire the
thing, preferring tactics and ballot-hoxes
with sliding panels. The Communist element,
which doesn’t want to know what the
majority thinks, or to let the majority think
at all, but dreams of government by a violent
minority, would certainly use violence, if
necessary, to keep the referendum off the
Statute Book. As for the saner section of
the community, it is too slow and stodgy to
make the matter a front plank in its plat-
form, or to realise that it is vitally concerned.
So one day, when the Upper House is dead,
and the Lower House is packed and gerry-
mandered out of all knowledge, and when
the majority wants to express itself about a
levy on capital, or a general confiscation of
land, or the repudiation of debts, it will find
that it has no means of expression, and will
be rightly served by the discovery. Com-
munism scored a big enough vote at the
A.L.P. Conference to show that it may be
the coming power which will very soon cap-
ture the Labor movement, and the referen-
dum and initiative would be very handy
weapons in such a case. Unfortunately the
first isn’t a holiday and the second isn’t a
horse race, so it is as difficult to rouse any
real motion about them as it is to get a fly
out of a pot of glue. Men of the Fuller
and Lawson and Barwell type talk elo-
quently against the Bolshevik movement, but
the simplest precaution is beyond them.
♦
The Pharisaical Fuller Government.
Replying to a deputation from the New-
castle racing clubs, which want the Govern-
ment to reduce their taxes, Cocks, the
N. S. Wales Treasurer, mentioned that his
revenue from the totalisator was slumping.
“It is because there is so much illicit bet-
ting,” said one of his visitors. “If that is
the case,” Cocks burbled, “I will refer the
matter to Mr. Oakes, the Chief Secretary.”
Perhaps he didn’t mean to be jocular, but
some of the illicit-betting brotherhood must
have regarded the allusion to Oakes as the
joke of the season. Oakes was acting-
Premier when certain big shop-bookmakers
were raided by the Sydney police. There
was ample prima jade evidence that the
raided parties had been carrying on an un-
lawful business, and presumably dodging
the tax-gatherers; but for some mysterious
reason they were never brought to book, and,
rightly or wrongly, there has always been
an impression that an order not to prosecute
was issued. The Bulletin has seen a let-
ter sent from a Sydney bookmaker’s office
to a dissatisfied country customer who, fail-
ing to interest the racing authorities in the
matter of a disputed bet, talked of placing
the facts befoi*e the Crown Law Department.
McShortodds remarked, in choice McShort-
odds language, that the man with the griev-
ance would merely waste his writing
material, for this reason: —
All the leading bookmakers’ places -were raided
last November (i.e., 1922), but the Government
stepped in, and told the police that it wasn’t reput-
able men who took commissions to be executed on
licensed racecourses they wanted to stamp out, but
hairdressers and others.
Since that was written proceedings have
been taken in numerous cases against “hair-
dressers and others,” but the influential
gentry who loaf round notorious Sydney bet-
ting shops and clubs have pursued their
useless calling untroubled. Last month,
moreover, a small country bookmaker was


prosecuted at the instance of the 1 olice l)e-
-■ partment for advertising his business in the
local journal, and the magistrate fined him
£3. Far bigger advertisements are inserted
hy far more important operators in Sydney
daily and weekly newspapers, but the i olice
Department is as torpid as a hibernating
toad. From a crowd which thus discrimin-
ates in favor of the big lawbreaker and
tax-avoider, it is idle to expect any measure
of reform. A Government which gave
earnest thought to the monstrous evils that
have grown out of the betting business m
N. S. Wales, and was bent on remedying
them as far as is humanly possible, would go
in for the following reforms: —
(1) Abolition of proprietary racing in all its forms.
(2) Restriction of meetings to Saturdays and
public holidays.
(3) Totalisator licenses to be conditional on clubs
installing two machines, one straightout, the other
place. The present 60-20-20 implement is a rather
stupid “concession”-betting device which drives
many punters to the bookmaker, especially where
there are small fields and only two or three horses
fancied. A straightout tote would pay larger
prices, particularly on outsiders, than are obtainable
from Dynamiteodds, and a place machine, with
equal percentages, would enable the backer to
cover a straightout bet, which is seldom possible
under the existing system at Randwick. The Gov-
ernment would gain revenue thereby, and numerous
odds-crampers would find their occupations gen '.
(4) An embargo on the publication of nomina-
tions, handicaps and acceptances until 11 o’clock on
the morning of a race-meeting. By this means bet-
ting w r ould be virtually restricted to the only place
where it may be legally carried on— i.e., the race-
course—and the clubs would get more gate-money,
the Government more income from the totalisator.
The proposal would involve no hardship to any
deserving class, and it would administer a deadly
blow to the nefarious starting-price business, which
has become a real danger to the State a source of
crime, misery, economic waste, industrial inefficiency
and unrest. On Wednesdays, when the ponies race,
half the working population of Sydney can’t do a
decent day’s toil for wondering whether Oyster will
break it in the Urgers’ Welter or Paddymelon in the
Galloway Garrotte. The Government forbids the
publication of anything relating to sweeps, although
no one ever ruined himself by purchasing sweep
tickets, and has made it an offence to print ante-
post prices, thereby playing into the hands of the
odds-cramping fraternity. Were this interdict shifted
to nominations, handicaps and acceptances there
would be no such thing as ante-post betting; also,
a multitude of fools would be saved from their folly,
and a legion of loafers would have to look for work.
However, The Bulletin lias doubts
whether it is any use suggesting racing re-
forms to the present Nationalist and Labor
parties. In one way and another both are
mixed up with the gambling interest and
appear to be in abject fear of its vote.

Ambition Overleaps Itself.
The National Defence League has done great
work for Australia in the past 15 years, but
its just-published programme is too much
of a good thing altogether. The Federal
Government is requested to adopt this
policy:—
(1) Provision and maintenance of a naval unit in
southern Pacific waters at least as effective in its
main ships as the visiting Imperial Special Service
Squadron, any capital ships to be provided by arrange-
ment with the British Government.
(2) Provision of an Australian naval base for
bases) capable of docking, etc., such a naval unit.
(3) Full development of our land and air forces
and munitions to defend such bases, as well as the
important coastal cities and commercial harbors of
Australia, and to repel invasion.
None of the Powers can afford the amphibian
standard which brought ruin to Germany.
Even the plutocratic U.S.A. has cut down
the enlisted personnel of its army to 125,000
men, representing an effective force of about
25,000, to balance its 18 capital ships, 2o
cruisers and 309 destroyers. France has the
biggest army in the world and 1000 farst-
line aeroplanes to Britain’s 100, but her
navy, relatively to the R.N., is negligible.
Japan, the most militaristic of the nations,
with a number of disaffected colonies to con-
trol, has reduced her army to about 200,000,
and is concentrating on sea-power. Aus-
tralia has two defence alternatives. It must
choose one. If it attempts both it will pro-
bably go bankrupt and have neither, lue
cheapest and safest is co-operation, by means
of a national fleet, with a British squadron
in the Pacific. If Britain is once enabled
to fight with capital ships in the Pacific,
Australia will automatically become as
secure from attack as the British Pacific fleet
is from defeat. At present the British Navy
is no more mistress of the Pacific than of one
of the oceans on Mars. Australia’s safety
rests not on international morals (seven-
eighths of Britain’s 60-odd possessions over-
seas were acquired by conquest), not on what
a pacifist politician recently termed ‘ the
strong arms of its native sons” (we have
practically no weapons to put into the arms
of our native sons), but on the chance that if
Australia were occupied the British would
come to the rescue later—say in two or three
years, which is the minimum_ time in which
a capital-ship base could be improvised. If
the Singapore or some equal scheme is gone
on with, the only land-defence organisation
required here will be a skeleton force suffici-
ent to train the C.M.F. and provide a nucleus
of staff officers for any future expeditionary
army. If not, then a truly desperate posi-
tion must eventually be faced. By institut-
ing military and industrial conscription we
could perhaps put into the field an effective
army of 60,000, consisting not of school-
boys, nor yet of heroic though debilitated and
untrained native sons, but of physically fit
and fully trained and equipped men of a
fighting age. Under no circumstances could
we do better even by cutting out naval-
defence expenditure altogether. The pre-
sence of such a force might scare off a
potential invader; on the other hand it
might not. It would have nothing to say,
for example, to an enemy ship capable of
shelling such a city as Sydney with 16in.
guns from below the horizon. And it could
do nothing for our trade routes. It goes
without saying that an invading army would
be given a bad time, but the price of vic-
tory would be the destruction of our richest
regions—and we might not win. In brief,
naval defence is the only practicable defence
for a country situated as Australia is, and
to attempt to associate it with land defence
on a large scale is merely to weaken patriotic
effort, and put a weapon into the hands of
those who are opposed to every form ot
defence.
The New Imperialism.
One fact established by the Snowden bud-
get is that almost all classes in the U.lv. are
tired of the old Imperialism. For genera-
tions the autonomous Dominions m their re-
lations with Britain have been guilty ot
the traditional fault of the Dutch—-of giv-
ing too little and asking too much. Ihe
World War, which flooded Britain with
large, often affluent and occasionally arro-
gant Dominions warriors, began the process
of disillusionising the people of the U.K. as
to Australians, Canadians, etc., being strug-
gling settlers in need of the financial and
naval protection of the Motherland; and the
peace has completed the lesson. 1 lie chief
contribution of the Imperialists of the
Dominions to Britain’s social, economic and
other problems has hitherto consisted of pro-
testations, spoken and choral, of love and
admiration. These fine words were
accepted as butter for Britannia s parsnips
till recently, when, with 22 per cent, ot the
nation’s skilled workers unemployed, and
an annual relief and sustenance bill of
£100,000,000, it began to be widely understood
that a lot more was needed. Butter becomes a
superfluity when there are. no parsnips to
put it on —and more specially when it is
synthetic butter. Yet the old-style Im-
perialists doggedly refuse to face the new
facts. It was cabled last Thursday that
Canada (the Dominion which has refused
all its life to take any part worth mention-
ing in the naval defence of the Empire) is
disgruntled at the British Government’s de-
cision to drop the McKenna duties after
August 1 next: —
Under the McKenna duties, Canadian motor manu-
facturers enjoyed in the British market a
preference of 33-J per cent, over their American rivals.
The latter were so handicapped that they had been
compelled to establish branch factories in the
Dominion. Consequently during the past few years
the export of automobiles and motor-trucks from
Canada to Britain had reached an unprecedented
volume. .
Now one of the missions of the Special Ser-
vice Squadron to the Dominions was to im-
press on them that. unless Britain can sell
more goods to the only customers able to
pay for them —such as the wealthy mhapi-
tants of Canada, Australia and M.L. ner
already forbidding situation is going to get
a great deal worse. Instead of whining at
the prospect of selling fewer cars m Britain
a genuine Canadian Imperialist would (1)
deplore Britain’s short-sightedness in not
protecting this valuable and vulnerable
market against all competition by a tariff
at least as large as that of the U.S. and
(2) resolve, anyhow, to buy British in pre-
ference to foreign goods, where possible, and
to persuade his friends to do likewise. It
is significant that the Empire Leagues and
Empire Unions which used to utter such
challenging cries at every election of the pre-
war period (a happy epoch when Britain
had no need of the assistance of any over-
seas political organisation) are either dead
or gone to ground. The typical citizen
who used to make party capital out of them
may now be seen driving to his business
(consisting largely of Yankee agencies) in
a U.S. car, wearing a suit of ready-made
American clothes, an Italian hat and a
German shirt and underclothes. If the pro-
paganda which was employed so busily a
dozen years ago to the discredit of the Aus-
tralian Navy were now applied to the boom-
ing of British goods of a type that Australia
is at present importing from America and
the European continent, some constructive
work of great value might be accomplished.
There is tremendous scope in the film indus-
try alone. In one Australian State there
are 2000 picture theatres with seating accom-
modation for a million persons. During
Britain’s recent film week 4000 British
films were shown, featuring such artists as
Owen Nares, Nina Boucicault, Russell
Thorndike and May Brough. We shall
never see one of them in this country while
America’s monopoly of “custard-pie comedy
and sin drama’’ endures, and it will endure
until a move is made by those who consider
that Australia’s debt to Britain is greater
than any obligation it is under to the U.S.A.

Seething with Discontent.
The Maoriland railway strike was over in
eight days. Its utter failure ought to
moderate the belligerence of those transport
union officials who have been talking strike
in Victoria and issuing threats m N. b.
Wales. All large-scale strikes of Govern-
ment railwaymen collapse miserably. As
motor transport develops and public opinion
hardens against organised hold-ups on the
part of Government employees who receive
Arbitration Court wages and numerous privi-
leges, the chances of their succeeding grow
less every year. Yet there are always union
bosses who thirst for the glory to be gained
by striking a bellicose attitude and getting
their ranting utterances reported in the
papers; and if grievances are wanting at the
moment they can be manufactured. Ihe
Victorian Commissioners have been threat-
ened with sectional strikes because, in the
words of one Sheehan, a union organiser,
they are “offering large sums of money to
workmen in the form of bonuses and merit
increments.” What they have introduced
is merely a profit-sharing system, but their
mild innovation is described by Smith,
general secretary of the A.R.U., as un-
bearable tyranny,” while another worthy
declared at a Melbourne meeting that
employees who took extra money for good
work instead of demanding that the bonuses
should be distributed among mediocrities, in-
competents and loafers in the form of higher
wages, were “traitors to the organisation and
to their class.” Had the exuberant Smith
kept his eyes open when lie made the pil-
grimage to Moscow, he would have found
the Soviet Government experimenting with
the hated Taylor card system, cause of, or
pretext for, the 1917 N. S. Wales strike.
More observant visitors have testified tin at
every Bolshevist railwayman who exceeds
the average daily output of toil is specially
rewarded —maybe with a second ticket foi
the Karl Marx lecture or an additional
dead rat. It is odd that this feature of the
Bolshevist system should be condemned as
“unbearable tyranny” while others are so
profoundly admired. For example, at the
recent A.R.U. convention, which “extended
fraternal greetings to Soviet Russia,”
obscure delegates who objected to huge
levies being struck by union officials without
reference to the members were reduced to
silence by the withering remark of Buck-
ley, secretary of the N. S. Wales branch,
that “Lenin and Trotsky hadn’t put the
question of the Revolution to the Russian
people.” Buckley is the Labor politician
who was expelled from the party last year
on the ground that he had been privy to the
making of ballot-boxes with sliding panels.
His appeal was dismissed at the late A.L.P.
Conference, Willis, the president, assert-
ing that the sliding-panel expert had been
paid with Buckley’s cheque after that
gentleman had received the money from the
A.L.P. But he is still privileged to speak
for 63,000 Government employees and to
menace the Ministry with their mass vote,
while keeping a gun pointed at the N. S.
Wales taxpayer. It is alleged with tedious
iteration (the dreary old phrase is trotted
out every few months) that “the railway ser-
vices are seething with discontent.” The
real trouble is that they are seething with
Buckleys and Sheehans.

Taxation Bandits.
In the levying of Australian taxes, direct
and indirect, landsharks, bookmakers and
American film companies are treated with
peculiar tenderness. But a special sandbag
is kept for the few mining prospectors—a
useful but perishing class —who happen to
make a modest rise. Gregory, M.H.R. for
Dampier, has a constituent who joined the
search for oil in Northern Westralia, a rich
but neglected region. His party struck indi-
cations which enabled them to sell their
ground for a consideration of which one-
fifth was paid in cash and the balance in
shares. Never imagining that his portion
would be regarded as income within the mean-
ing of two Acts, he omitted to supply par-
ticulars until the Westralian department,
which assesses and collects for both Com-
monwealth and State, wrote demanding them.
In process of time he learned that his income
for the year in question was as fololws: —
One-fifth share in sale of oil leases.. .. £1,700
8500 shares at £1 .. .. .. •• 8,500
One-fifth of 17-20 of £3OOO, being sale
price of portion of original holding . . 510
Total income .. .. .. .. £10,710
Nothing was allowed for his expenses in
earning the alleged income. Accompanying
the statement was a demand for payment of
taxes, as under :
Commonwealth.
Tax on £10,710 at 61.056 d.

When the £5207 18s. 6d. was peremptorily
required the victim’s shares, which were
never disposed of, were quoted at 9s. on a
sagging market. If he could have sold the
whole parcel at 9s. net (a most unlikely con-
tingency) he would still have been £1382
18s. 6d. short. Perhaps he will solve the
problem by going insolvent. That was the
expedient forced on another Westralian, who
sold a bit of a gold-mine and was ruined in
the process by the remarkable rulers of a
country in which prospectors are bled white,
while horse-gamblers, film-exploiters and
other parasites flourish.

Thomas in Search of a Compromise.
The Irish situation becomes no more lumin-
ous as time goes on, and the elements of
quarrel are many and mixed. These are
some ingredients in the soup:—
Lloyd George fixed the boundaries of the two
Irish States (six counties in the North-East and
26 in the Free State) for all time. Then he did
one of his slides and revoked. The new arrangement
was that the boundary was to he fixed by three
Commissioners, one appointed by each of the Irish
States and one by the British Government.
With his usual acrobatic agility he didn’t make the
appointment of the Commissioners compulsory.
Whether the Dublin men noticed the point is not
certain. The Belfast men did.
The Belfast men lay down three propositions:
(1) They weren’t consulted about the new arrange-
ment though the Dublin men were, so they are not
boon I by it. (2) In any case they needn’t select
their Commissioner for a few centuries, and haste is
undignified. (3) They aren’t going to part with any
territory to please anybody, and if Britain leaves
them in the lurch they will line the existing border
with their own troops and bid the enemy do his
darnedest.
The Dublin party claims that the Free State should
take from the North two counties (Tyrone and Fer-
managh) and one city constituency (Derry) in
which there are Roman Catholic, and presumably
Sinn Fein, majorities. It is put as a plain case of
self-determination.
The Belfast party replies that the Sinn Fein
trouble prevented the taking of an Irish census
in 1921, and so many things have happened since
1911 that the existing figures are useless. Owing to
Sinn Fein’s own act Belfast says it does not know that
there is any R.C. majority in Tyrone and Fermanagh
and in Derry City, or in any other Irish county or
city, or in Ireland itself. In 1911 the R.C. majority
in Tyrone was very small (5139 Roman Catholics to
4861 non-Catholics per 10,000 inhabitants). It
may have wholly disappeared since then, Belfast
argues, especially as the 1911 census showed that
non-Catholics were becoming a larger percentage of
the population of the island generally. Anyhow,
even on the old figures, Tyrone could be given a
Protestant and pro-British majority any day by
extending its boundaries across Lough Neagh to
take in a bit of Armagh, where Protestants are
going to waste —where there are Protestants to burn,
so to speak.
Latest reports were to the effect that British
Colonial Secretary Thomas was working in-
cessantly to find a solution of the problem
which will be acceptable to both parties. It
is an easy problem to state, at all events.
The Law wants to hang Smith, and smith
wants to be acquitted without a stain on
his character. How arrive at a settlement
satisfactory both to the Law and to. Smith.
If Thomas succeeds lie deserves a big statue
and a pension. Possibly he will propose to
set up the two disputed counties as a separ-
ate State, and get himself disliked by all
parties. If the matter could be allowed to
sleep for a few years, it might settle itself;
for if the Free State became highly pros-
perous under good government and a Protec-
tive tariff, the North-East might join up
voluntarily in order to get on the right side
of the Customs barrier. Further, the North-
East’s present Government of liardshells will
in time be replaced by men who have for-
gotten the civil war —always provided there
isn’t another civil war. But apparently the
Free State isn’t prepared to wait on the
chance of these things happening.

The Unlicensed Estate Agent.
Dear Bulletin, —Ten more estate agents
have lately opened business between my
house and the one a mile away that Smith
lives in. (You may not know Smith, but it is
a pleasure to live that distance away from
him.) They include “realty experts,” “flat
specialists” (I suppose these let special flats,
or specially let flats, or possibly they look
out for flats, and specialise in them because
they are easier than sharps), “property and
financial agents,” and the common or garden
agent. Most of them seem to think I want
to buy a house, which I don’t, or to sell my
present house, which I can’t, for it isn’t mine.
They are a busy, buzzing lot. They all
“manage estates,” though the number of
estates betwen my place and Smith’s is
limited. They also offer fire, life, marine,
accident, hail and employers’ liability insur-
ance. What I want to lead up to*is that
this tribe should be licensed, as it is in pro-
gressive spots where it is quite usual for the
police to oppose the renewal of the land-
monger’s certificate on the ground of fraud,
gross misrepresentation, overcharge, failure
to account for the money, etc. This system
tends to keep down the number of agents,
and to improve the quality. I don’t know
anything less indispensable than a superflu-
ous estate agent, and I know few things less
pleasing than an absconding one, except one
who remains. A development of recent
origin is the itinerant dealer in allotments,
who collects small deposits, gives a sort of
contract, and furnishes an oral assurance
that the view is marvellous and that the
ground is next door but one to almost every-
thing. It is not only on rising ground but
in a rising neighborhood, and its future is
sufficiently assured by the fact that land in
Sydney has recently gone up £2OO per inch,
or something. When the buyer comes from
the bush to see his acquisition, by which time
he has almost forgotten the vendor’s name,
he generally drops the subject. The way
I would run a business of this sort
would be to sell highly undesirable proper-
ties for a quick forfeiture and a quick re-
sale, and not to take so much from any one
man that he would think it worth entering
on horribly expensive litigation on the
plea of misrepresentation. I really see
no reason, provided the property is suf-
ficiently undesirable, why a brisk trader
should not take a chance, and sell the same
block several times at once. He could always
blame the wandering agent, who would
naturally wander off the map. To my mind
the buyer’s remedy, though it certainly
exists, is of little more practical value than
the one a citizen would have against, the
push if the police were abolished. That is
to say, he could proceed against the pushites
for damages, and carry the matter to the
Privy Council if necessary. But it would
be simpler if a land investor could just leave
his address and his case with Police-Sergeant
Murpiiy, who would pass it on to higher
quarters for research, so that when enough
case accumulated the dealer could be em-
phatically closed up for the whole Common-
wealth, and prohibited from even dealing
with earth in a flower-pot for the rest of his
days. He shouldn’t even be allowed to sell
shrubs if soil was attached to the roots, or
potatoes unless they were washed clean. I
once wrote a descriptive bit to help a friend
who was making his maiden effort by cutting
on a countrv “estate.” Part of the truthful
effort ran like this:—
The eminently desirable property known as Bare-
bones Vale is at last being put on the market in
medium-sized areas, suitable for any purpose to which
purchasers may successfully adapt them. The
property is situated half-way between Hillbottom and
Top Hollow, and six miles from each. These may
be confidently regarded as rising towns, because they
haven’t risen yet, and it is hardly possible that they
can stay so far down as they are for ever. They are
both places of unexhausted possibilities.
The land under offer is at least as elevated as
any similar land of the same height in the world.
The views are fully as splendid as any buyer has the
right to expect, and are replete with all the features
that could be reasonably anticipated. The adjacent
railway runs east and west, so that when the night
train is late it catches the morning sun. The high
road runs through the centre of the Barebones Vale
estate. It is so called because it is high time it
was repaired. The climate is healthy, being wholly
free from cholera and many other serious diseases.
All the water in the neighborhood has been boiled
(see Genesis, chapter ii., verse 6), which tends to
prevent germs.
That and much more to the same effect was
really a better description than the Yale
deserved, though the vendor didn’t use it, but
wrote one for himself. The place sold
well, and is now thickly settled with wild
dogs, and when the name is changed it will
doubtless sell again. I don’t think there is
any sort of place that an unlicensed estate
agent can’t sell —with impunity, too. —Yours
ever, Clifford Snooic.

And the Cock Crowed Thrice!
Freetrade, like pacifism, internationalism,
Communism and so many more hifalutin
aspirations, is a creed that is constantly being
denied by its own followers. A Protectionist
is what the word implies—a person who be-
lieves in the tariff defence _ of industry.
No one in a responsible position has advo-
cated genuine Freetrade anywhere since the
world started definitely to turn towards I ro-
tection ; and nowadays it is hard to see where
Cobdenism begins and the other policy ends
even in England. The position was stated,
though in a different connection, by that
clear-headed thinker, Lord Birkenhead in
a recent character sketch of the British
Labor Minister, J. 11. Thomas :
I am persuaded that, whatever he once believed,
he knows now that for this country to socialise the
means of production, distribution and exchange,
whilst other countries adhere to individualist sys-
tems, would at once involve us in devastating ruin.
During the World War, when defeat and
the disintegration of the Empire were possi-
bilities, no Protectionists became I i ee-
traders, but even such eminent Cobdemtes
as Lloyd George and Asquith turned Pro-
tectionist, arid the Safeguarding of Indus-
tries Act was one of the results. The
“McKenna duties” were imposed in the in-
terests of British motor-cars, musical instru-
ments, films and clocks by one who has
been a professed Freetrader since he entered

public life 30 years ago. The Macdonald
Government claims to be “Freetrade or no-
thing,” so it had to make a show of abolish-
ing them. However, it did not rush the
business after the manner of reformers re-
moving a burden from the nation’s afflicted
shoulders. According to a Budget cable:—
The Cabinet, at the eleventh hour, was still
divided, a number of Ministers being - impressed with
union fears that industry would be gravely imperilled
if the duties were instantly allowed to lapse.
And finally the lifting of the Protectionist
curse was postponed for three months.
When the Chancellor of the Exchequer
finished his speech last week Lloyd Geoege
walked over, wrung his hand, and later
applauded the Budget for its Freetrade quali-
ties. Yet only a few weeks previously Lloyd
Geoege had written in a London weekly:—
Even with trade showing a distinct improvement,
our exports are 25 per cent, less than before the
war, yet the population is 2,000,000 higher, so
that our trade should be 5 per cent, more than in
pre-war times. Post-war problems, including ex-
change, have forced other countries to develop their
own industries, and they are making goods that were
formerly bought from Great Britain. The number of
foreign ships has greatly increased, while British
ships are carrying less.
The chief reason for this calamitous state of
affairs is the poisonous Freetrade dogma
that whatever is cheapest is—other things
being even approximately equal—best. As an
example of the rule in operation, the Indian
Stores Department recently handed an order
for five locomotives to a German firm, Ger-
many’s tender being 20 per cent, lower than
Britain’s. According to Whitakeb’s
Almanac (1924) :
During the first eight months of 1923 Germany
bought 509,644 bales of cotton, against 443,343
bales bought by Great Britain, while for the corres-
ponding period of 1922 Great Britain took 195,000
bales in excess of Germany’s purchases. German
manufacturers appear to have reorganised their
businesses, and instead of purchasing British textiles
in various stages of manufacture, the German cotton
mills are engaged on the raw product.
Not only are all the countless divisions and
subdivisions of Lancashire’s chief industry
hit in the overseas markets by this competi-
tion, but it is felt with equal force in the
unprotected home market, adding ever to
the frightful economic burden of unemploy-
ment, and to the resulting deterioration in
the national moral. But the Freetrader
holds his head up and remarks in effect that
things might be worse, and that it will take
another war to induce him to betray Cobden
again.
♦
Disease Regarded as a Crime.
Dubing a debate in the Representatives a
few days ago on the disabilities of returned
soldiers, the Treasurer, Dr. Eable Page,
remarked: —
I personally would have a distinct objection to my
medical history being recorded in Hansard. My
private ailments concern no one except myself and my
doctor.
The reference was to the military custom
of treating V.D. sufferers as malefactors.
On active service a man who develops V.D.
—it matters not whether the disease was
contracted before or after attestation—has
the fact entered in red ink in his paybook
and put in the official record, and is de-
prived of his pay while in hospital. The
fiction is that he is so treated because he
has committed a breach of discipline. But
a soldier may injure his health in innumer-
able other ways—by soaking himself with
alcohol, by neglecting his teeth, feet or eyes,
or by associating with known or suspected
sufferers from infectious or contagious dis-
eases—and run no risk of being penalised.
The truth is this is a mediaeval survival,
like the R.N. habit of saluting the quarter-
deck. Its basis is a _ monkish fury against
unehastity. There might be some justifica-
tion for the convention if all men of fight-
ing age were natural celibates. There
would also be something to be said for it
if the Army authorities, recognising the
absurdity of aspiring to enlist so much as
one battalion of St. Anthonys, laid them-
selves out to keep V.D. from the soldiers by
every means known to science from the first
moment of war. In the last war the fight-
ing had been raging for three years before
any serious. organisation was established for
the protection of men on leave; and even
then the Army heads had to be spurred on
and helped with both cash and service by
civilians. In the circumstances the sooner
the military view as to the contraction of
V.D. being a form of crime is dropped the
better. The modern army—educated, fully
articulate and liable, in the case of Aus-
tralia, anyhow, to be a volunteer organisa-
tion—-has a much clearer perception of the
meaning of a fair thing, in the disciplinary
sense, than its predecessors. Few things are
likely to be more prejudicial to recruiting
in the years to come than the knowledge,
disseminated by Parliamentary debates, that
a man who enlists for overseas service, and,
no matter how, acquires V.D., is going to
be shown up, so far as the authorities can
do it, in his unit and his home, and deprived
of both pay and pension rights. The rational
and equitable thing for the State to do if
it wants results is to jettison the religious
aspect of the question, and treat sufferers
from V.D. in the same way as those who
have contracted other complaints. V.D.
would then become a problem to be tackled
like typhoid and the rest of the dirt diseases.
It would then be not a thing to be cured
merely, but one for drastic prevention. If
the State once acquires this point of view
the day should not be far off when the ap-
pearance of a Y.D. case in an army abroad
will result in the carpeting not of the victim,
but of the regimental M.O.

From a skipper’s cabin:—
The Commonwealth Government has taken its
three Billy Hughes ships off the Java line and
begged the Ellerman people to carry on. They may
be able to do it without showing a loss even though
the Commonwealth has been losing £3OOO a trip.
It is chiefly a question of manning, though, of
course, the ships on this run ought to be oil-burners,
and Billy's boats are not—they are just ships, which
may fetch one-fifth of what they cost. The Eller-
man line will probably have a native crew. Any-
how, the boats won’t be registered in Australia, and
therefore won’t come under the Commonwealth Navi-
gation Act and Commonwealth rates of pay. These
rates are for seamen approximately two and a
half times greater than those paid on British boats,
and the master’s pay is about double. But it is not
the seamen’s £2O a month that is the most deadly:
it is the overtime. You say, of course: “Well, why
don’t you arrange things so that you don’t have to
pay overtime?” It can’t be done—the unions see

to that. A boat is timed to sail first thing in the
morning. A couple of the firemen, say, haven’t got
over the night before, and at the last moment throw
their bundles ashore. You try to get two men to
take their places: you find you can’t —the rest of the
crew won’t let you; anyway, not for some hours.
So the ship doesn’t get away till late at night, per-
haps next morning. Time-schedules had been pre-
pared ; all these are thrown out. Overtime then has

by the mistaken loyalty of their mates, will cost the
line three or four hundred pounds—they have done so
dozens of times. There are other lessons to be

under present Australian conditions you can no more
do a foreign trade at a profit than you could success-
fully run a steam yacht as a collier.

“Bronco North” : Re the ratoon-cotton con-
troversy. Last Spring, in the Dawson Val-
ley (Q.), upon 45 acres of land which had
been prepared carefully and early, I planted
seed five different times, only to have the
whole lot destroyed upon each occasion by
the usual light showers followed by hot sun.
It was the end of December before we got
a “strike” from the sixth planting. These
tender and still delicate plants looked ridi-
culous compared with a few strong, healthy
ratoon bushes growing a few feet away.
The latter had dozens of bolls already burst-
ing with good cotton, and (owing to their
earliness) without insect pests of any kind.
Like good and obedient damned fools, we
hoed up the good bearing plants (as per
Government orders) and left the little weak-
lings. Now that good rain has come and
the cotton plants are bearing, the native
pests are so firmly entrenched that they have
destroyed every boll and flower on the lot.
This is our third similar experience. Do
you wonder that we want to fight?
«
On “credits” and things:—
When an Australian Labor paper takes up the
cudgels for the Red Republic it gets into all sorts
of difficulties. Arguing that “Russia must have
credit in London,’’ it being “necessary to the wel-
fare of both countries,” the leading A.W.U. organ
is indignant with those British bankers who pointed
out that the Soviet Government must first create a
favorable atmosphere by acknowledging its debts
to British subjects and respecting private property.
The Worker regards this as a Monstrous Misuse of
the Money Power; and the remedy suggested is the
Nationalisation of Credit—“nationalise credit, abolish
private banks and the whole hierarchy of High
Finance and the end of Capitalism will be very near!”
The joke is that these identical measures have been
tried for years by the Bloodstained Republic whien
“must have credit in (capitalist) London,” being
now broke. In the same issue of the Worker there
is a long list of union representatives who, it is
alleged, have failed to account for sums collected
cn behalf of the railway workers’ branch of the
A.W.U., together with the information that “a num-
ber of warrants” have been issued and one man
imprisoned for three months. It seems brutally in-
consistent, but there it is—capitalistic credits for
the defaulting Red Russian; capitalistic gaols for
the defaulting A. W. Unionist •
„ ♦
R.G.G.” suggests a remedy for one ill:
“J.E.” in the “Ways of the Law” (B. 10/4/’24)
puts his finger on a scandal which makes our claim
to have a democratic government ridiculous. Of
what use is it to declare that all men are equal in
the eye of the law when Smith, a poor man, cannot
defend his civil rights against Jones, who is pre-
pared to spend thousands before giving up the fight?
As the matter stands, after the first few appeals
the parties become as gamblers, losing sight of the
oi iginal issue in a desperate attempt to get square
by obtaining a final decision that will leave Costs
to be paid by the other side. This could be remedied
without prejudicing the cherished right of the sub-
ject to bring his grievance to the highest tribunal
m the land. We should provide means whereby a
person, when commencing or appearing as defendant
in any civil action, could make a declaration that
he would not appeal against the decision of a certain
Court, naming either that before which he was pri-
marily to appear or any higher to which he thinks
his pocket can carry him. The other party could go
as high as he liked, but would be compelled to
pay his own costs in connection with the appeals
to any higher tribunal than that mentioned by the
first man. Nothing, of course, would prejudice
the right of the defendant to name a lower tribunal
than that named by the plaintiff when instituting
the suit. Thus poor but honest A sues the rich and
arrogant B, but declares that he will not appeal
from the Supreme Court’s decision. If the Supreme
Court decides for B, A must pay up and look pleas-
ant. If A is declared the victor, B has still the
right of appeal to the High Court, or even the
Privy Council. But the knowledge that, win or lose,
he must pay the piper will restrain B from avail-
ing himself too freely of his right to call the tune.
Hardships may appear in practice; but in view of
the known hardships of the present state of affairs,
the scheme should at any rate be worth a trial.

Dr. Richard Arthur, M.L.A., writes:—
There are certain forms of cancer (among others
sarcoma) which sometimes respond in an almost
miraculous way to treatment by what is know'n as
deep X-ray therapy or by radium and radium emana-
tions. Other inoperable cases are greatly relieved,
and have pain lessened by exposure to these rays.
The lamentable thing is that, as far as I am awaiv,
there is as yet no public institution in Australia
where patients can receive free treatment by this
method. I believe a public subscription was being
raised to supply the necessary apparatus to the
Melbourne Hospital, but I cannot say if it has
materialised. I have tried to induce the Minister
for Health in N.S.W. to do something for this
State, but he has evidently more important matters
to attend to. .It seems deplorable that poor persons
are denied the help which some, at any rate, could
obtain, were this treatment available. A few private
medical men have the apparatus, and very kindly
treat a certain number of indigent patients; but it
is not fair to impose this tax upon them, as the
cost of installing and running the plant is very
considerable. I would urge that every State Govern-
ment should equip an institute—say at a cost of
£25,000 —where any persons in their State who
cannot be relieved by surgical means, and who are
unable to pay private fees, should be given the
chance of cure or alleviation of their condition by
treatment by deep X-ray therapy and radium.

“Wellow” : Re “Murder Trials and After-
wards” (B. l/5/’24), and the suggestion that
juries should be allowed to return a verdict
of murder in the first, second or third de-
gree, one of the States, Westralia, has moved
a step in that direction. The Criminal Code
there recognises two sorts of murder, one
with the prefix “wilful” and the other un-
adjectived. The way in which the differen-
tiation is worded has always seemed to me
unfortunate, because it may be argued that
murder with the “wilfulness” taken out of it
is really nothing more than manslaughter; but
the intention of providing a half-way house
between manslaughter and the blackest sort
of murder is plain. And the object has been
achieved to the extent that juries know —or,
at all events, may rest satisfied —that a mere
verdict of murder, though the death sentence
must follow it, will not send a man to the
gallows, simply because the sentence indi-
cates that the condemned is not in the same
category as, say, a Deeming or a Butler,
IN one the less, if the distinction had been
made between murder in the first and second
degree, Westralian Judges would have been
saved a lot of trouble in trying to explain to
juries, and to reconcile with jurisprudence,
that killing with malice aforethought isn’t
necessarily wilful.

Jhe U.S. Congress has adopted the clause
in the new T Immigration Bill shutting out
Japanese. It has thereby created the valu-
able precedent that it is legitimate to dis-
ciiminate against the people of a particular
nation, because it is impossible to compete
with them in the matter of cheapness or for
other unspecified cause, and it must be
equally legitimate to discriminate, by special
tariff rates or otherwise, against the goods
ot a particular nation, because we can’t com-
pete, or for other cause. It may be a dis-
grace that we can’t compete with manufac-
turing Uncle Sam, but neither grace nor
disgrace comes into the argument. The point
is that Australia has to dig un from
£10,000,000 to £18,000,000 every year to pav
the trade differences with its bad customer-
one who believes in selling every kind of mer-
chandise and taking practically none in re-
turn. The matter being a special one calls
lor special treatment—say 100 or 200 per
cent extra duty on U.S. goods, to last until
Uncle otters us an adequate measure of recipro-
city. An all-round increase, which would strike
equally at good customers like France Italy
and Japan, wouldn’t meet the case. ’ It is
clearly one for discrimination, and the U S
immigration precedent shows that discrimi-
nation is not only respectable, but amounts
to a positive virtue.

The number of State Labor politicians
with designs on Bruce’s job is becoming an

poor old Matt Charlton grows quite testy
when the subject of Theodore s transfer is

There’s many a slip ’twixt the pants and

cruellest of them in Victoria the other day.
When Lawson threw up the Premiership to
take the Speakership, ex-Premier Bowser
saw a chance to pay off an old score—five
years ago Lawson pushed Bowser out of the
'Liberal Cabinet because he dared to call a
meeting of the economy section of the party
and discuss balance of power m the Minis-
try. His antipathy sent him into the Cocky
party, and when the Hayseeds, prodded
on by Dunstan, decided to make Lawson
bite the dust for kicking Allan, Old, Goudie,
Wettenliall and Crockett out of the com-
posite Cabinet, Bowser accepted a nomina-
tion for the chair. Of course Labor glee-
fully joined in and polled its full strength,
and Lawson went down hard. Now Peacock
is wondering what is going to happen to
him.
Humiliation of Lawson was not wholly
Labor’s reason for helping the Cockies to
put Bowser in the Vic. Speaker’s chair.
Pledge-and-caucus wanted to emphasise the
waning power of the Nationalists and the
“undependableness” of the Agrarians, who
were so recently the auxiliaries of Lawson,
Peacock and co. Besides, there was a tit
which Labor wished to give the Libs, for
two tats in the last 20 years. Beazley,
Labor member for Abbotsford, who had
acquired a sort of mortgage on the Speaker-
ship by being the ailing Duncan Gillies s
deputy, was put in the chair by Premier
Irvine and the Opposition combined after
the veteran’s death. Seven months later
Beazley was tossed aside to make room for
Frank Madden. Then, in 1913, when Elmslie,
Prendergast, J. W. Billson, Lemmon and
other Laborites fluked into office, the Libs.,
led by Willie Watt, wouldn’t wait till Min-
isters could get re-elected to Parliament (as
was then required) before blowing the Gov-
ernment up. So Lawson, as candidate, and
Peacock, as present head of the withering
Libs., had to suffer for the sins of Bent,
Watt and other whilom strutters on the
State’s Parliamentary stage.
From “Galleryman’s” windowed niche: —
Lawson took his licking in the Vic. Assembly like
a sportsman. Not so some of his journalistic sup-
porters, who charged his opponents with “petty
enmity” and “not playing the game,” or F. IV.
Eggleston, who remarked bitterly at a school dinner
that the ex-Premier had been “victimised” —all be-
cause the majority of members exercised their right
“TEARS, IDLE TEARS!”
“Tn his important speech on the future of our trade relations with Great Britain, Mr. Bruce intro-
duced a regrettable note of personal pique at the failure of the part he played at the recent Imperial
Conference.”
THE KID: “Is that all you’re crying for? I thought maybe your conscience was Prick-
ing you over the size of the hill.”
to say who the Speaker should be. The fact that
Lawson was pre-selected by the crowd in office and
prematurely installed in the Chair by the newspapers
gave him no title to the job. Even if Allan and
Prendergast were actuated by a desire to achieve a
party triumph and administer a slap to the hectoring
dailies, there was nothing improper in voting as they
did. If Lawson was “victimised,” as Eggleston urges,
then Allan, as Cocky leader, was no less “victimised”
when Lawson ended the Composite Ministry without
consulting Farmer John. But the angry newspapers
won’t admit Allan’s right to feel hurt. Chivalry to
a political enemy hasn’t got that far!
Lloyd George lias written an article in
the Nation on Britain’s lack of work and
downheartedness. Britain, he says, requires
larger foreign markets; in other words,
wants foreign nations to buy more of its
goods. The idea of saving the local market,
in which imports exceed exports by some
£200,000,000 a year, so that local factories
are shut while everybody goes round in
foreign clothes, would be Protection, and
Generality George only skirmishes on the
fringe of that yet. Friendly foreign States
might lower their barriers against Britain’s
cloth and iron, and give it better foreign
markets, if Britain lowered its own barriers
against their pet products, for reciprocity
treaties are quite common; but until
Britain has big barriers to lower it has
nothing to bargain with.
The S.M.’s decision to fine two of the
chief Sydney hotels for “having allowed
liquor to be consumed on the premises after
6 p.m.” reduces the demented liquor situa-
tion in N. S. Wales to greater chaos than
ever. The gravamen of both offences was
that visitors to the hotels had given dinners
on the night they engaged their rooms. (One
host occupied his room, the other went home,
but neither was accepted by the Court as a
bona-fide lodger.) It is clear that if this
decision stands, no hotel will be safe in allow-
ing a guest to entertain on the night of his
arrival. But will it be permissible for him
to do so on the second, or even the third
night? There seems to be no means by which
the hotel can know when a given patron
leaves the bogus and enters the genuine lodger
class. Princes had whipping boys in feudal
times: it may be practicable for Govern-
ments which propose to entertain visiting
admirals and business men who find it useful
to foregather occasionally to instal dinner
boys at the leading hostelries. But the
proper solution is for Nationalism to take
its courage in both hands and rectify a posi-
tion that has become a public scandal.
A bit of Peacockery:—
So many radical changes are proposed in the redis-
tribution of seats scheme submitted by Peacock’s
Ministry to Vic. Assembly that it is not likely to
pass this Parliament. Afraid to lessen the numbei
of rural electorates (44), the Cabinet has merely
reshuffled them and added three metropolitan seats
—24 instead of 21. Peacock’s pocket borough (Allan-
dale) disappears, and if the plan is ever adopted he
will have to fight Labor for Talbot, which takes in
Maryborough. In the metropolitan area Jika Jika,
Abbotsford, Fitzroy and Flemington, all Labor strong-
holds, are wiped out, as also is East Melbourne,
which the Libs, have hitherto managed to hold. For
these five, Coburg, Footscray, Heidelberg and North-
cote are substituted ; and the number of metropolitan
seats south of the Yarra is increased by four—ltew,
Caulfield, Elsternwick and Malvern. Berwick, Gee-
long East, Geelong West, Mildura, Talbot, the
Grampians, the Mallee and Wonthaggi are to take
the places of ruled-out Geelong, Allandale, Gun-
bower, Maryborough, Ovens, Stawell-Ararat, Warren-
heip and Eaglehawk —-if the bill passes.
Queensland’s one House of Parliament
will do all its legislating this year in day-
light. Sittings will begin at 0.30 a.m. and
end at 5.30 p.m.; the Speaker will then
“automatically” leave the chair, unless he
has been bombed out of it sooner. 1. lie
innovation will be awkward for Ministers
who have a press of work in tlieir depart-
ments; but the point that is worrying ora-
tors is that young working people will
be unable to improve their minds by
listening to the debates. A heartless depri-
vation, but the young working people will
survive it. And if they find they can t, what
easier than for Parliament to proclaim a
three-day working week for all classes ot
wage-earners?
Ex-Minister Arthur Griffith lately _ made
the mistake of applying for re-admission to
the N.S.W. Labor party, but was informed
that anybody who had advocated compulsory
enrolment in the army (as distinct from
compulsory enrolment in a trades union)
was out for life. Compulsory service was
the proud invention of an early Labor Gov-
ernment, but now it is the one unpardonable
sin. There is room in the Labor movement
for Communists, and they swarm there like
rabbits, for no one requires that an appli-
cant for admission shall not be a Commu-
nist-only that he shall not be such a fool
as to advertise himself. There is room in
it for Black Australians and Yellow Aus-
tralians, who say that all men, especially
the worst sort, are brothers. Pro-Huns can
get in, and pro-Russians. But there is
very little room for pro-Australians.
There never was a time when sheep were
such good national property as they are
to-day: the world is clamoring for our wool,
and nowhere can better wool be grown in
quantity than in Far Western N. S. Wales.
But owing to Government neglect the West
is incapable of carrying one-third of its old
flocks, and the wild-dog curse is making
havoc of even the sorry remnant. The
Lands Department in Sydney is indifferent
and the Western Lands Board is impotent.
Between these two the country is losing
millions a year. The State on the western
side of the border-fence dealt with its wild-
dog pest satisfactorily; but it means money,
and because the State Government can’t
see how it can get effective votes in return,
the money isn’t available. Wherefore the
time has arrived to consider whether the
Commonwealth shouldn’t take that territory
over, and enable it to earn some of the mil-
lions that are now annually flung away.
Sydney owns a Henry George Club,
though the institution doesn’t seem to run
to a telephone. It retorted on Prime Min-
ister Bruce the other day with a resolution
to the effect that Freetrade is a fast-growing
movement, and that people are rising in
wrath against the Protectionist tariff because
it “abnormally increased the number of fac-
tories.” The Georgeites seem to mistake
factories for death-adders.
Dr Raymond Pearl, head of the LhS. De-
partment of Vital Statistics, announced last
week that “moderate and steady drinkers
had a better expectation of life at all ages
above 30 than total abstainers. Heavy
drinkers had the poorest expectation of life
between 30 and 65, while after 65 heavy
drinkers and total abstainers had about
equal expectation.” His findings were
“based on many years’ study of the drinking
habits of thousands of Americans through-
out their lives.” But there was little bad
drink in America before 1917. The nation's
whisky, for example, came chiefly from Glen-
livet, or Dublin, or Kentucky’s Blue Country ;
and the distillers had a reputation to main-
tain. The modern Yank of any age who
has so much as one drink is, on the other
hand, liable to be poisoned. What can be
said, therefore, is that a drink or so a day
prior to prohibition was likely to prolong a
man’s life; under prohibition a drink any
day is liable to end it. Dr. Pearl’s records
prove the first part of the statement; the
police and coroners’ records prove the second
part.
The Federal Treasurer has been sitting be-
side bags of money, telling the holders of
soldiers’ gratuity bonds that if they hand in
their claims for verification they can be paid
a month ahead of time, with full interest up
to May 31; but the Australian, who is sel-
dom late for the first horse race, has made a
Avretched response. Probably the last-moment
rush will be so great and so late that some
doubtful claims won’t be paid till the glad-
some Spring.

“Mr. Lawson, who resigned the Premiership in the

But what with storm and stress,

And calumny and blame,
I ultimately came

When venomed tongues cut loose,
I hankered for a truce
From shrill detraction.
And here I fondly viewed
A chance of quietude

Nay, pedestal—for which

They lured me to mishap
From ambuscado.
I see myself—and groan —

The dog that dropped the bone
To grab the shadow.
And so I muse perforce,
By knavery gross and coarse
Undone, by vain remorse
Consumed and smitten ;

After making provision for depreciation, bad
debts, internal insurances, losses and sundry
contingencies which do not come within public
scrutiny, the directors admit that there was
still £178,663 in the bag as the result of 12
months’ trading to the end of March. Though
that was almost 16 p.c. on paid capital, it
cannot be taken as the full measure of net
earnings. In the introductory table £3694
visibly added to an insurance fund and to
sundry reserves (now together totalling
£408,686) has been tacked to the profits dis-
closed by the management, but large amounts
written off for “depreciation, bad debts and
losses” almost certainly include true profits
which are being stored for contingencies and
to strengthen the co.’s very solid interests.
The following table shows the amounts which
have been so written off for a number of
years:—•
1916. . £74,719 | 1919. . £68,664 | 1922. . £106,587

The notable feature, of the depreciation policy
has been the. expansion of the votes in recent
years, notwithstanding that Island assets
with a half-million book value were trans-
ferred to a subsidiary in 1919, and that
meanwhile only £lOO,OOO of new cash-paid
capital has been introduced.
When dividing Pacific interests the parent
co. retained those which came under Com-
monwealth control (Papua and New Bri-
tain), and the subsidiary took over trading
in Fiji, Tonga, Samoa, the Solomons, Gil-

The parent co. holds two-thirds of the South
Sea Co.’s paid capital, and its profits were
helped last year by £25,000 of divs. from
the subsidiary. Crediting the parent with
its two-thirds interest in subsidiary earnings,
profits for nine years, prior to providing for
depreciation, etc., have been as follows :
1916.. £193,302 | 1919. .£296,152 I 1922.. £302,171

The figures have been maintained at remark-
able heights considering the troubles which
shipowners have experienced since the war*
boom collapsed, and in this instance results
have been more astonishing because the co.
has depended for much of its earnings on
trading in island produce, the values of
which slumped horribly a couple of years
ago.
One important source of income which is
never mentioned by 8.-P. reports and
accounts is the subsidy received from the Com-
monwealth Government for maintaining ship-
ping and mail services to the Pacific Islands.
Exactly how much is received by the co. in
this way is not ascertainable even from
the Auditor-General’s report, which states
the total amount paid, though all of it may
not have been received by 8.-P. • 1922
£49,167; 1923, £46,805: and for the year
ended .Tune 30 next Parliament appropriated
£53,200. These figures are so big in rela-
tion to the co.’s disclosed profits that the
investor must consider the likelihood of a
continuance of the subsidies on their present
scale when measuring prospects of the busi-
ness. It is unlikely that Parliament would
indefinitely pay substantial subsidies to the
co. if it is proven that the management can
earn reasonable profits without that assist-
ance. Perhaps there is not so much in the
Western Pacific trade as some people,
especially island customers, believe; any-
way, only those inside the office can
know how Papuan and New Britain
activities contribute to aggregate results
from the widespread business. Gen-
erally, the position looks more satisfactory
for the co. than it did a couple of years ago
when the mandates allocated by the Peace
Treaty threatened to strengthen Japanese
competition in the Islands trade. In the
reports of both the parent and subsidiary
cos. the directors are on this occasion much
more cheerful; a new passenger, and cargo
steamer is being built to replace the lost
s.s. Mindini, and the South Sea Co.’s fleet
and trading stations have been “further aug-
mented,” and are expected to be satisfactorily
employed during the current year.
The 8.-P. Co.’s paid capital is 11 million,
and so much of the reserves which are visible
make total funds £2,069,000. Adding the
interest in the subsidiary’s reserves gives an
approximate total of £2,091,000. There is
not the slightest doubt that there are large
internal reserves: the fleet and other assets
have been written down year by year, and
the figures were in no way inflated by -yvar-
boom values. The market, however, values
the enterprise at £2,125,000 : £l-paids were
bought last month, with a 2s. div. in sight, at
an average of about 345., and at that price
10 p.c. returns 6 p.c. Considering the health
and strength of the big concern and the gen-
erally improved condition of trade, and not
overlooking how well the co. did during the
period of depression, the price is a moderate
one—that is, when measured by the assets.
Unfortunately, the investor is not allowed to
see precisely what he is buying. Here are

That table states the position for share-
holders only; actual earnings have fre-
quently been much larger than the figures
given there. The business was established
by the Wunderlich brothers 37 years ago,
and the present co. took over 16 years back.
Early in the new co.’s career, the Wunder-
lichs, being more imaginative and far-
sighted than most manufacturers, realised
the advantages to be gained by giving their
employees a substantial interest. They in-
troduced a comprehensive and liberal staff-
partnership scheme based on a 10 p.c. re-
turn on actual cash put up by shareholders,
so the amount which becomes available for
employees in the form of divs. and partner-
ship certificates (which are payable at full
face value at death or on retirement after
lengthy service) depends on how much the
factories earn for shareholders. For the
past 12 months the co. had a splendid run.
Net profits amounted to £62,240, and as
shareholders have received 12J p.c. divs
staff-partners have been voted 7% p.c. on
their certificates (5 p.c. in 1923) and £16,175
has been taken for the issue of new scrip
for employees and to make additions to a
superannuation fund, compared with £1935
appropriated 12 months ago. The year’s
profits were, therefore, divided as follows:
pref. holders, £5600; ordinaries, £37,500 •
employees’ divs. and certificates, £18,700 •’
balance available for reserves, £440. Those
figures give striking evidence of the genuine-
ness of the Wunderlich profit-sharing scheme.
(Jne feature of the allocation of profits which
may give shareholders some concern is the
smallness of additions to reserves, but as
practically the whole of the amount applied
to buy certificates (£16,175) will remain in
the business for many years, that can also
be treated as an addition to reserves subject
later on to what, in practice, will
be equivalent to life-endowment pay-
ments. Altogether, employees’ scrip and the
superannuation fund now tot up £50,000
Shareholders’ paid capital is £380,000, and
there are visible reserves over and above
goodwill amounting to £43,196: goodwill still
stands in the books at £65,702, but in 16
years £108,898 of surplus profit has accumu-
lated. The next table shows the annual
votes to employees for the past eight years:

The only guide to the business given
investors is in the published figures; Wun-
derlich directors make no comment what-
ever on operations in their reports, which
are confined solely to allocating profits.
However, disclosed earnings (net profits
only are given) and comparisons of balance-
sheet figures disclose solid progress and a
generally healthy condition. The latest
suggest that all troubles which
'were experienced in the post-war slump and
during the subsequent period of depression
have been satisfactorily cleared, though even
during the few difficult years the div. rate
did not fall below 10 p.c. The average div.
rate for 10 years has been 9.7 p.c. p.a!
-balance-sheet comparisons over 12 years

The co. won its reputation with artistic
metal-work; nowadays there are factories
producing asbestos-cement sheets, terra-cotta
tiles and numerous side-lines. The total
book value of factories, plant and all fixed
assets on February 29 last was £305,262
and there were stocks, book debts, cash and
Government securities totalling £250,135
Liabilities amounted to only £55,220. After
payment of final divs. there w r ere net tan-
gible assets with a book value of 225. lOd
per £1 ordinary share. There are 300,000
of them; the balance of paid capital is in
two lots of £40,000 each of 7 p.c. prefs
On the strength of the latest 12$ p.c. div.’
and of consistent good returns in previous
years, the shares are popular: at the current
middle price of 295. 6d. the p.c. div
rate returns slightly less than 8| p.c., and
a fall to 10 p.c. would give only 6f p.c.

Taxes have to come out of that £13,238, so
the year’s actual earnings are not quite so
good as the published accounts suggest. How-
ever, a comfortable margin should be left
after the State and Federal Treasuries have
had their divs., and that will compensate
for the co. having lived a little beyond its
income in the previous two years. To pay
15 p.c. for 1921 and 8 p.c. for 1922 reserves
were drawn upon for £391. Considerable
additional capital has been introduced since
the co., which began in the ’eighties, became
a public concern and was listed on ’Change.
Here are some comparisons going back four
years:—.
„ . ' .. ~ 1920. 1922. 1923.

oash . etc 253 551 1,450
Gross profits at £43,462 last year were only
£l2OO larger than those for 1920,
though £29,100 of new capital had been
introduced; but some of the £15,000
raised during the past 12 months was
not in the business long enough to help
earnings. In several ways the wine trade
is not quite so easy as it used to be; restric-
tion of trading hours of saloons, strenuous
competition and, more recently, pressure by
the breweries, who insist on being intermedi-
ary agents for wines for their tied houses,
have narrowed profit margins. The wine
trade would be bigger had "those in control
in former years not allowed the saloon trade
to become disreputable; some of them
thought more of encouraging casual sales in
filthy dens than of building up a clean trade
which would popularise good Australian
wines and ultimately be more profitable for
grape-growers and distributors.
Though 15 p.c. divs. were paid for two
years and 8 p.c. for 1922, Caldwell’s scrip
has been under a cloud: prior to the pre-
sentation of the latest accounts and the de-
claration of a 10 p.c. div. sales of ordinaries
ranged from 16s. down to 14s. 3d. As 2s
per share is immediately distributable, the
buyer at 16s. is in a 14J p.c. proposition
if 10 p.c. divs. are maintained, while even
7 p.c. divs. would return 10 p.c. There are
tangible assets with a book value of 20s. Bd.
per £1 ordinary share: goodwill stands in
the balance-sheet for £25,000, but is covered
by accumulated profits with £2704 to spare.
The introduction of new capital has con-
siderably reduced indebtedness: £34,380 at
December 31 last, compared with £68,390 in
1920. Most of the security.for capital, however,
is in fixed assets and book debts, and much
of the value of the former is dependent on
the success of trading. Stocks and cash at
December 31 were £12,927 more than all
liabilities, £49,777 was tied up in vineyards,
cellars and plant, £48,813 of advances and
sundry debtors were secured and £21,773 un-
secured.

When the 1923 accounts were presented
stocks were heavier than usual, the manage-
ment having bought extensively in a market
which it regarded as “favorable.” Retail-
ing prospects were misjudged, and gross
profits for the past 12 months were only
£18,095 compared with £25,130 for the pre-
vous year. Apart from taxes paid in
respect of 1923 trading, there was a loss of
£2610. (The drift has continued since the
financial year closed, because in April the
directors said that “the best interests of share-
holders would be served by writing down
stocks wherever considered necessary.” They
also propose to make “considerable altera-
tions in the method of conducting the busi-
ness,” and several departments, ladies’ sec-
tions in particular, which have shown losses,
are to be closed down. No doubt there will
be sacrifices in clearing some of these stocks.
The management has also decided that it is
bad business to accommodate workrooms in
costly city properties, so they are to be
transferred to a less expensive area, and
portion of the city freehold premises are to
be remodelled for letting. Until the re-
organisation is completed and stocks are
cleared, shareholders evidently cannot hope
for a recovery. Fortunately, though £lO,OOO
of reserves were capitalised in the 1921
financial year, there is still an accumulation
of £5036 to tap if required. With stocks and
book debts practically at normal on January
31, the co. was working on a small bank over-
draft, on £9500 mortgage on properties and
owed £2930 otherwise. The management
will, therefore, have to seek new funds to
pay for the factory and to remodel the city
premises. The latest balance-sheet compared
with those of 10 years ago and of the peak
boom year as follows:
IQI4 1 Q9l tqoq 1Q94

At January 31 last there was a surplus of
stocks, cash and book debts over liabili-
ties (apart from the mortgage) of £47,478.
Provided no serious losses ai’e incurred in
stock realisations, the co.’s position is not
uncomfortable. Its future, however, depends
on how the smaller business responds to
re-organisation and on whether rents justify
the expenditure on the new building and re-
modelling of the old. The co. has through-
out given only moderate divs.
Australian Gaslight is in the market again
seeking additional capital; on Monday, May
19, 30,000 shares of £6 each will be auctioned
in lots of five (with the option of taking up
16 in each parcel) by Richardson and
Wrench. The Gas Act has been chopped
about, and is not as clear as it might be;
but for present practical purposes the maxi-
mum div. payable on the shares is 8 p.c.
p.a. ; they are virtually guaranteed that rate
by the Act allowing for the revision of sell-
ing prices to give sufficient profit for that div.
and for providing adequate depreciation.
The Electric Light and Power Supply Corp.,
which has exclusive rights to supply elec-
tricity in five suburbs not served by the Syd-
ney City Council enterprise, is seeking
£150,000 new capital. The directors require
£50,000 to pay off debentures maturing on
May 30, and the balance will be invested in
additional power-house equipment and to
provide for extensions of supply.

On Friday, at Liverpool (Eng.), the last
small parcel of the 2,691,833 bales of wool
for the marketing of which the British Aus-
tralian Wool Realisation Association was
formed in January, 1921, was sold, so Bawra
woolselling activities have ended. Concur-
rently, the association’s third annual report
and accounts up to December *>l last
were being circulated, and speculators have
been making guesses at. the amount or the
final clean-up. Neither the published
accounts nor statements of sales since Decem-
ber 31 (209,614 bales were then held) give
any definite clues to the prospective final
div.; but possibly by the time shareholders
meet (Thursday, May 29) information will
be available as to likely net proceeds from
the six series of sales in England which m
four months have cleared all stocks. Even
when all the cash from these sales has been
remitted to the Commonwealth, several mat-
ters affecting the amount available at liquid-
ation will remain to be settled. Foremost is
the liability for taxation : last year’s good
markets established beyond all doubt that
realisations would ultimately produce some
millions over and above the book value
which had been given stocks, and which
determined the amount of scrip issued. John
Higgins and a team of taxation and account-
ancy experts are endeavoring to convince
English taxing authorities that Bawra “was
founded, and has been conducted, purely as
a realisation co. —that it is not, in any _ re-
spects, a trading concern, and therefore it is
not assessable for taxation.” Pending a deci 1
siou, :1| million, equal to 2s. Id. per Is.-
paid share, had been reserved in. a taxation
contingency fund at December 31. How
much more is involved in the “profits” on
the balance of stocks since sold is a further
contingency to be considered. Bawra has
certainly a good case to present to the Courts
should the taxing authorities make the raid.
The fixing of capital at 22 millions was solely
an accountancy expedient to provide a basis
for adjusting individual interests in the
stocks; they were taken in at prices
appraised by the Wool .Committee less 40
p.c. allowance for depreciation.
Other matters awaiting adjustment are
the final disposal of the £1,447,381 held in
trust by the Central Wool Committee in con-
nection with the famous wool-skin case, and
£286,940 more also held in trust by the Com-
mittee in respect of wool-brokers’ commis-
sions. Neither amount is included with
Bawra assets, and the Wool Committee has
yet to receive and consider the voluminous
judgment of the Privy Council given in its
favor in March. Even if Bawra receives the
whole of the £1,447,381 held in trust in
respect of the skin-wool deals, there is one
knotty problem to decide —that is, whether
or not only original holders of shares and
priority certificates are eligible to partici-
pate. Their interests in the association, it
is argued, were adjusted after making pro-
vision for settlements with the claimants
had they won their cases, and at no stage
have the assets so held been taken into Bawra
accounts. The latest report throw’s no light
on the matter; it merely states that the Vv 00l
Committee “will not determine the disposi-
tion” of the funds until it is assured that
there is no possibility of further litigation.
At December 31 the trustees held £346,201
of Bawra scrip, but this has since no doubt
been reduced to £34,620 by the return of
9s. per share in February. In that case the
trustees now hold 692,403 ls.-paid Bawra
shares and £1,699,702 of public securities
and cash. So far as can be estimated the
position of the shares is as follows: —
(1) At December 31, after allowing for the pending
return of capital and assuming that no taxation what-
ever was payable, the Bawra balance-sheet showed a
surplus of £8,621,173 of Government securities,-
property, book debts and cash over and above, lia-
bilities.' That was equal to not quite 6s. Od. per
share, including 25.,.1d. per share held in a taxation
contingency fund.
(2) There were 209,614 bales,nh hand at January
1 last, and this has since been sold. The total was
made up of . 47,223 bales Maoriland wool and 162,391
bales Australian wool. The whole of the M.L.
47,223 bales and also one-half (81,1951 bales) of
the Australian wool belonged to the British Govern-
ment ; Bawra handled John Bull’s holding under
agency agreement. Bawra’s proprietary interest
was thus in 81,195! bales. Until a statement of
net proceeds is available and the taxation liability is
determined additional interests which have accrued to
the shares during the period cannot be definitely
ascertained. On the reckoning that the 81,195*
bales Bawra-owned wool have realised £2O per bale
after deducting all charges, approximately £1,624,000
has been harvested, and in addition are the com-
mission earnings on agency transactions and also
interest earnings of investments. To give another 3s.
per share £1,777,200 would be required. That seems
a reasonable expectancy.
(3) Assuming that the whole of the skin-wool and
other trust funds revert in full to Bawra, £1,699,702
of liquid assets would be transferred, together with
692,403 of its own shares. Cancelling this scrip,
there would be approximately 3s. per share to cut
up among the 11,155,638 shares remaining.
Assessment of the value of the scrip is de-
pendently on three gambles: (1) taxation;
(2) the Wool Committee’s (and, in the end,
perhaps the Courts’) disposal of trust funds;
and (3) net earnings from 1924 sales. Allow-
ine 3s. for earnings since December, 7s. sd.
looks a minimum value *° investors who
bought scrip from original holders; but it
other factors all go their way, there are pos-
sibilities of an approximate maximum: ol
12s6d. Only last month there were buyers
in Sydney at 13s. 2d., but the market gamble
is now down to a few pence more than 10s.
One point to be considered is that a y
period may be necessary to effect liquidation,
not only because of the taxation and trust-
fund complications, but to permit the sale
of millions of public securities.

One of the most likely-looking of Papuan
oil-ventures is the New Guinea Oil Co., Ltd.,
in 200,000 £1 shares, which is offering
100,000 contribs. to the public and handing
50,000 paid-ups (but no cash) to vendor
parties. The co. has secured concessions
over 500 sq. miles which have be ® n intro-
duced by the Haynes brothers (R.b. and
L.T.), both for more than four years geolo-
gical-survevors on the Anglo-Persiajts .Papuan
staff. That co. alone spent in Papua at
least £60,000 in the five years to 1923, and
the Commonwealth Government approxi-
mately £75,000, but under the Bruce Gov-
ernment’s policy the Crown monopolises only
1000 sq. miles, including the Popo bore site.
When the true story of the Commonwealth s
participation in the Papuan oil-hunt is told
—how Melbourne officialdom failed to grasp
opportunities or even* follow the advice ot
the costly experts it engaged—-it will make
one of the worst chapters in the volume ot
failures of Government enterprise. How-
ever, P.E. may benefit by the mass of techni-
cal data which has accumulated from the
Government effort. _
The objective of the New Guinea Oil Co.
is the Hohoro anticline, a few piles from
the coast and near the Lailala River. Alto-
gether this area has been recommended by
13 geologists, and has in no instance been
condemned. Dr. Wade, on March 28 this
year, reported
The whole occurrence compares almost exactly in
type, structure and age with the conditions presen
in the oilfields of Sumatra. The presence of oil m
the anticline is proved by numerous seepages ol oiL
and gas along the crest of the anticline so that the
onlv thing in doubt is the quantity ot ml that is
present at depth. Oil is got in commercial quanti-
ties from similar pinched anticlines im Sumatra.-^ 1 n
Louisiana the presence of a .major; pult
structure is regarded as a favorable piece of evidence,
so that .taking, everything together the co i ld^“ n *
such as to,:, encourage the expenditure of money in
testing therstriseture to depth. While it is rnipossible
to say that Hfefn commercial exist
before drilling:' is done, it can be said ttapall the
conditions are present . w ’” ch „ w ? uld , v luitlf
assumption. The drill is the final .aml oidy. arbiter.
1 can certainly recommend the Ilohoio site foi drill
ing of a test- well for oil.
A detailed survey is ready-made for the co.,
W. G. Langford, geological-surveyor, having
completed that work for Dr. Wade- some
years ago. There are 500 known seepages
on the concession, and at least. seven auti-
clines which geological examination suggests
are capable of holding _ commercial pools.
Capital is being raised privately, ana a party
of four is already on the way to Hohoro to
arrange preliminaries. The site for the'first
bore has been selected, and the co. s experts
expect to strike oil first at 300 ft. and to
tan a pool, if a commercial one exists, at
1200 ft. Total cost of equipping and com-
pleting the first hole is estimated at £l(,OUO.
Eight cos. have taken up 6000 sq. miles
around the Hohoro venture, and two ot them
are registered in the name of Burns, I hup
as agents. •' >-
* * * *
Instead- of the producing oil-well which
early reports from the field and an over-
optimistic Mines Minister had anticipated,
Lander Oil’s No. 1 bore at Orallo (Q.) has
so far given only a peck ot trouble. The
cementing and re-cementing of the hole,
which was to have permitted the staff to
explore the 115 ft. of oil-safids met at 2233tu,
have not been successful, and work is held
up pending the importation of a special oil-
well cement. Cementing is a difficult pro-
cess • it is. in fact, unusual for the work to
be completely successful at the first attempt.
It is advisable that the sands should be
thoroughly tested before the drill punches
down to 4000 ft., where the main body of oil-
sands is expected. Meanwhile Bander is
preparing to sink a second well about three
Liles away, and 20,000 contribs. are offered
to put in drilling plant and provide funds.
* . * *• *
Geologist Jensen has made a further ex-
amination of the Tewantm bores (Q-) ™
the Coastal Oil Concessions. The first bore
stopped at 305 ft. through bad drilling. The
second bore at Pandanus Gorge is dqwn
240 ft., and is passing through shale with
traces of oil. North Concessions has a bore
down oter 400 ft. about four miles north,
and it also has been passing through shale,
and at 400 ft. gave an iridescent oil-film ot
sufficient interest to keep Jensen on the |pot
watching operations closely and testing
samples. His samples ot the film were
analysed by Government Analyst Hender-
son, but the best showed only 0.027 p.c. tree
oil and any shale chemist would probably
say that that was nothing unusual for an oil-
shale. In fact, rarely is an oil-shale found
entirely devoid of free oil. Nevertheless,
Jensen says the chances east of Noosa are
bright indeed. His latest report is more
optimistic than the one he made last year.
Port Phillip Oil, which has been shoving
down a shallow bore at Back Beach, Wil*
liamstown, is the latest Vic. oil co. to talk
of “encouraging results.” Whilst operations
were suspended awaiting the delivery ot
casing, “light crude volatile petroleum
seeped into the heavy water sands being
drilled.” When drilling restarted a violent
gasi blow” sent the tools speeding up the
borehole, and 65ft. of. sands ran up the
casing. J. L. Strevens is hopeful of bring-
ing in a well” within the next 200 ft., and o,
dousing the Vic. Geological Survey officers
and U.S. geologist Clapp with the liquid they
say doesn't exist in the Cabbage Harden
Meanwhile the Boola Boola Co., down 990 ft.
at Traralgon (Vic.), is suffering from tre-
mendous gas and sand pressure.
Lake View and Star (W.A ) announces
that for the five months ended February
working account showed a profit of
and that approximately £4OOO of gold pre-
mium will be collected. The earnings,
however, include £5565 won from a clean-
up around the old plant. I rom the tota
has to be deducted £4648 for development
and £4198 spent on plant, so that apart from
the old plant’s contribution the profit for
the period amounted to less than £4OOO, or
at the rate of about £9500 per annum. To
holders of the co.’s 1,000,000 issued shares
who have been waiting for more than three
years for a div. the figures are not cheering.
Directors of Ives’ Beward (W.A.) are
still optimistic. Their latest aunualreport
estimates that there are about 50 000 tons
of payable ore on hand, of which 1500 tons
are at grass. Developments are described
“satisf actory.” To date tlic co. faas
receiS abSrt £30,000 from contributing
shareholders, and £3OOO-odd from gold won.
Its cash resources on December 31 last
amounted to less than £lfc>o, and against that
were a debenture debt of £6OOO and
a Government loan of £1535. In addition
a treatment plant now m course of installa-
tion had not been paid for. The co hopes
shortly to crush its way to prosperity, but
The Bhixetin has doubts on the matter.
Cheery Billy Cundy, of Bendigo, has run
the rule over the Devon (W.A.), which from
time, to time was thought to have good pros-
pects, but proved only a pit in Vfhich share-
holders’ cash became buried. At JMlft. the
reef was driven on 300 ft., and while yields
averaged fairly well they were infrequent.
Plant was a patchwork, and cash for develop-
ment was scarce. Cundy’s plan is to get the
incline shaft to the surface, have decently
high poppet-heads, instal a rock-breaker and
open up the mine. If £5OOO is spent m this
wav he considers that the Devon will become
payable. If not the machinery merchant will
have the final say. The tape shows 9000
tons ore available, and Cundy w ants the
wheezy 5-hd. battery increased to lo head.
The next move will be an attempt to squeeze
the necessary cash out of shareholders who
have been wearied by numerous disappoint
ments,
* *
W The public is to be given another chance
to buy Sutherland’s Lode, Iviandra (N.S.AV.).
This time the register will contain <o,OUU
shares, of which 45,000 will be
6d. down and 6d. on allotment and 30 000
paid to 2s. for vendors. The £2OOO-odd to
be raised is reckoned to be sufficient to
unwater the shaft to 69ft. and continue it
another 30ft. and learn something of pros-
pects by driving both ways on the reet.
Vimy Ridge (N.S.W.) has been very slow
with its first clean-up from 5-head. C. K.
Mackenzie, who is now the mine manager,
expects to announce results at the .end o
this week. After that he will run the bat-
tery three shifts, and add five head to it.
When things are shipshape for the 10-head,
and better arrangements made tor delivering
the ore, Vimy backers expect the show to
fulfil some of its early promise.
# * * *
Crown South Options (N.S.W.) has been
given a fresh lease of life by the. cutting ot
12ft. of quartz in the tunnel. Assays give
7dwt. to iOdwt. in bulk; and manager Rolfe
speaks of “specimen stone” at one point. The
unearthing of 12ft. of quartz a* 200 ft vor-
tical and nearly 200 ft. into the side of Bom-
bandy Mountain is easily the best develop-
ment on the Crown field to date.
* *
Clark’s, Charters Towers (Q-), is work-
inf< only one shift rfow and is winning a
little ore from tho stopes above No. 6. Calls
are being devoted to prospecting the Hidden
Treasure at 426 ft., where there is a small
hanging-w r all formation which Clark s tapped
in a crosscut some years ago without any
luck. It yielded a few good shoots near the
surface in the early days, but was a small
thing compared with the North Australian
and the old Moonstone. If prospecting does
not unearth anything, Clarks is almost cer-
tain to put up the shutters.
John Brandon has had the 60,000 contribs.
in his Mt. Isa Sontli fully subscribed, and
A. 04. Campbell, formerly g.m. ot B. u.
Block 10. has left for the field to map out a
campaign of prospecting and development.

WIMBLE'S INKS"
“Spare Corporal” : A recent cable reported
that 700 subscribers to the St. Barnabas
Pilgrimage Fund, “drawn from all parts of
the Empire,” are visiting the soldiers
graves in France. This is doubtless the
organisation which stipulates that pilgrims
must travel second-class or steerage, with no
more luggage than they can themselves carry,
and abstain from joining in social recreation
or taking part in any profane sightseeing
or pleasure whilst on the sacred mission.
Details of the jaunt were circulated in feyd-
ney but the idea failed to arouse much
enthusiasm, although I know ot one man who
joined the “pilgrimage. And I ot
another who forestalled these people
bv making the trip a penance tor
himself when he went to visit Ins
son’s grave almost immediately aftei the
Solstice. His wife and daughter travelled
saloon while he went steerage, and more-
over he subjected himself to all sorts of fast-
ing and deprivations. This was his way of
atonement; he had quarrelled with his son
and the boy, enlisting under an assumed
name, had fallen in France. The physical
suffering which the father added to his men-
tal trouble was such that on his return h
was a broken man. ,
“Detective Dogwatch”: “T.R.H. (B
24/4/’24) sighs sympathetically for tffe
“mere lad” who broke into Geoffrey Syme s
house at Kew, and who was so seared that
his gun went off “in the course ot the thrash ;
ing he got.” As a matter of fact, Ginger
Moore was old enough to have establishe
his reputation as an audacious and brutal
crook. He nearly fixed Syme by tearing his
flesh with a burglarious, pmcer-like tool.
Before that event he carried out a series ot
robberies around Darling Point and Eliza-
beth Bay, Sydney, using a borrowed rowing-
boat both coming and going, so that he lett
no tracks. More than once he fired when
seen; that he killed nobody was due more
to bad marksmanship than to lack ot intent.
He had just got out of a N.S.W. gaol when
he turned up at Syme’s place m Victoria
He was, by the way, born at Glebe, and
lived many years at Darlinghurst.
“X2X”: I cannot agree with “T.R.H.’s”
plea for Owen Moore (B. 24/4/ 24 ), now
serving a life-sentence in Pentndge tor the
attempted murder of one of the Syme family.
Though Moore was but a youth at the time
of the affair he had already a sinister record,
and had done his best to kill a Sydney detec-
tive. Some years ago, during professional
visits to Pentridge, I had several conversa-
tions with “Ginger” Moore, and the most
charitable impression that I could form was
that he was a criminal of the most dangerous
type, who, if released, would assuredly be
subject to recidivist impulses.
“Delver” on an old-time Argo
The first vessel to pass through Bass. Straits after
Flinders’s circumnavigation of Tasmania was the
Lady Nelson, 60 tons, an armed tender to H.M.S.
Investigator. Her commander, Lieut. James Grant,
made the first presentable charts
of the southern coastline of this
continent. He sailed from Ports-
mouth in March, 1800, and sighted
the coast somewhere near the pre-
sent boundary between S.A. and
Vic., in December. Cruising east-
ward he named Capes Northumber-
land, Nelson and Bridgewater;
also Otway and South Cape, which
last was to become Wilson’s Pro-
montory. Cape Liptrap was an-
other of his christenings; like-
wise the much photographed Hole-
in-the-Wall and the Devil’s Tower.
At Glennie Island his investiga-
tions touched those of Matthew
Flinders, and he reached Port Jack-
son on December, 16, 1800. Two
months later the same little ship,
commanded by Lieut. James Mur-
ray, R.N., entered Port Phillip.
Murray named the big expanse of
water Port Ring after the third
Governor of N. S. Wales; but King
modestly disclaimed the honor in
favor of his predecessor. A month
later the Lady Nelson, with Grant
again in command, was surveying
the Victorian coast in the vicinity
of Wilson’s Promontory. The
second vessel to make the Straits
was the Harbinger; Captain Black
took the risk in January, 1801,
and named King Island en route.
Three weeks later the Margaret, a
ship commanded by John Byers, took the shoit cat '
and thenceforward the south coast of Tasmania passed
out of the track of ships of commerce.

“Hasen”: There was an animated discus-
sion going on in the small shop;
Hegarty, the large shopkeeper, summed it
up as “a cryin’ shame!” and her audience
agreed with her. Mrs. Smith said *lt is
that,” and Mrs. Perkins “Terrible! Mr.
Perkins w T as there, too, but so openly ignored
by the council as to appear unreal, it a
had to do with Mrs. Benoni over the way;
Mrs. 8., it seemed, had had twins and
delirium tremens. At least, so gathered Mi.
Perkins, meekly listening in. The twins
were undoubted. The second part of tli
diagnosis was based on a story about-the
underdressed Mrs. B. With a naked tw
under each arm tearing along the Street on
a cold night insisting that she was pursued
by a blue-eyed tiger. ■ Also there was a sup-
plementary yarn of curious neighbors findin o
the lady unpleasantly hysterical and refus-
ing to be convinced that the twins were not
really a two-headed pink snake that hissed
at her. The twins, it seemed, were only
three months old, which made it worse.
“But,” said Mr. Perkins with amazing
temerity, “w’hat's her husband doing? Why

"You are the first man who ever kissed me!”
“Well, somebody had to start the darned thing.”
doesn’t he look after ’em?” “ Lsband!
cried Mrs. Hegarty with fine scorn. In
America ’e is and ’as been f r the last five
years. What’s ’e got to do with it? And
Mr. Perkins said, meekly enough, \\ hy,
nothing; nothing at all.”
“P.X.”: Though Australia suffers a good
deal from eye troubles it has astonishingly
few people born blind. In N. S. Wales the
average age of the blind is over 45. People
who see the Industrial School for the Blind
in Sydney probably think of it as a place
where 150 or so afflicted people make mats
and brooms, and 300 call in to exchange
their Braille books or have a game of cards.
But the work of the teachers is spread over
a vastly greater area than that. Recently
so recently that it is almost the present—
they were teaching reading to five old people
whose average age was 82. And it is not
only ordinary print they teach. One lady,
for instance, felt that, when she went blind,
she could do no more in the world because
she had always been a music-teacher. Within
a few weeks, however, she had learned to
read music written in Braille, and she is
carrying on her lessons as usual.
CAT S’ COMPLIMENTS.
“I really must get rid of this hat. It’s so
utterly out-of-date-looking.”
“Oh, dear, don’t —it does so become you.”
“F.A.”: Apropos of military executions
(B i.7/4/’24), I remember going into the
“Officers’ Club” in a H.Q. town in France
one night towards the end of 191 <. It was
a dismal night and there was nobody to
swap lies with till a captain of the sub-
staff. a man of about 40, arrived on feet
that seemed a trifle
unsteady. He gave
me a distant kind
of nod in response
to my greeting,
and flopped into a
chair. I watched
him closely, and
saw that he was
laboring under
some kind of ner-
vou s ' upheaval.
There was a de-
cided tremor in his
voice as he asked
me to join him in
a drink. He
gulped liis brandy
as though he
needed it, and
lapsed into silence.
Then he started up
suddenly and asked
me to pardon his
apparent rudeness
—he had had a very
nasty experience.
After a couple
more brandies he
became more nor-
mal, and I found
him a fairly soci-
able companion. As
he left, about an
hour later, two
staff men came in.
"By Jove, old X
stands it well,”
one of them said.
“Damned if I’d
like his job.” “An-
other to-day?”
asked the other.
“Two,” replied the
first speaker, as he
lit a cigarette.
“Yes, two; and he
had to finish one
of them off him-
self. Rotten job.”
X was the man
who had just gone
out. I learned that
his particular
branch of the Adjutant-General's department
dealt with C.-M. sentences in which firing
parties were needed; and he was responsible
for the efficacy of the proceedings, even to
the use of his own service weapon.
*** * '
“J. 8.”: With the sailing of the light cruis-
ers of the Special Service Squadron Austra-
lia lost a host of new-made friends. Fore and
aft, what a many-happy-returns-of-the-day
crowd they were! The Duke of Wellington,
had he walked aboard the Hood or any other
of the worships that have just left, would
have had a far different opinion to express
than he had when he inspected a man-o’-war
of his time. All the guns and brasses shone
like the sun. “Very pretty to look at,” said
Wellington, “but there is one thing wanting.
I have not seen a bright face on the ship.
Those were sad. bad days in the Navy, as
the Admiralty Petitions can affirm. “Our
Captain obliges us to Wash our Linnen twice
a week in Salt Water, and to put 2 Shirts
on every Week, and if they do not look as
Clean as if they were washed in Fresh Water
he stops the Person’s Grog which has the
misfortune to misplease him; and if our
Hair is not tyd to please him he orders it
to be cut off.” That was from the crew of
the Reunion. On the Amphitrite “flogging
is our portion.” The seamen of the Win-
elielsea “would sooner be Shot at like a Tar-
gaite than to Remain.” On the Glory they
“couldn’t humanly bear the beating, black-
ing, tarring, putting our heads in Bags and
I'orceing men to drink half a Gallon of salt
water.” Aboard the Nassau the treatment
was “above humanity, and we cannot face
the enemy with a chearful Heart.” One com-
pany in a petition set out that “when En-
gaged with the Enemy off Brest they [the
officers]' even Beat us at our Quarters,
though on the Verge of Eternity.” We’ve
come a long way since then, and are still
moving quickly.

“Light Horse”: “O.G.C.’s" Central Ameri-
can method of execution (B. l/5/’24) by drop-
ping a large rock on the patient’s head is
new to nip. They had rather an effective
method of hanging on the Klondyke in
the early days, stiid to have been introduced
by the N.-W. Mounted Police. The leading
nian stood on the ground and the rope from
his neck went over a crossbar. To the end
of the rope was tied a heavy sack—of flour,
usually, though sand would do —balanced
on the bar, with about three feet of slack.
When the sack was pushed off the bar, on
the side opposite to the prisoner, the law’s
requirements were invariably complied with
in quick time.

THE SUNLESS CITY.
[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
Gone west for more than forty years,
At last I’d learned to flv,
When sounds of childhood shedding tears
Were audible on High;
And presently there smote my ears
A boy’s distressful cry:
“I’ve never seen, the blessed sun
Shine bright upon this earth;
A daily course ’tis said to run—
But what’s the statement worth?
No scorching- sun has yet begun
To scorch me since my birth!
“Last birthday I was ten, and Tim,
My brother Tim, is seven,''
The youngster sobbed. Mine eyes grew dim,
And, leaning out of Heaven,
I dropped an angel-tear on him
Who soon would be eleven.
“Why was I born in Melbourne town,
Where skies are ever grey ?
The sun comes up, and then goes down,
I’ve heard my parents say ;
I think some angry cloud must frown,
And scare the thing away.
“The trouble started long ago;
The Glass seemed loath to move,
But Hunt, the bloke at the Bewrew,
Had got into a groove,
And always said —Dad told me so—•
‘The weather will improve.’
“At length the blessed sun got riled,
And hid hisself from sight.”
A cry of grief rang loud and wild.
I spread my pinions white,
And, having sorrowed for the child,
Resumed my angel flight.
It is, alack, as I foresaw
Whilst Melbourne held me fast:
Its deadly days, so damp and raw,
Are horrors of the past,
When mostly by Contrary’s law
Went Bureau Hunt’s forecast.
AFTER THE MOTER SHOW.
HER: “Surely we can run to a Ford, can't we? With a
different sort, of body people would never recog-
nise it.”
H IM: “Yes, I know—a Camouflord.”
Grey mists have settled on its chest;
Its climate is unkind;
The seasons have lost interest,
And blotted it from mind.
To feeling dismal and oppresst
Poor Melbourne is resigned.
I had gone West some forty years
Ere thus the truth was told,
Fulfilling all the blackest feays
I’d ever voiced of old,
Before I dwelt among the spheres,
And twanged a harp of gold.
VICTORIA.

“Lobjc” : The Criminal Investigation De-
partment of Melbourne has found a child
of seven too many for it. Little Johnnie’s
mother w’as wanted for lots of things, con-
sequently when P.C. Plop recognised the
youngster among the patients at the Child-
ren’s Hospital lie went home and told his
chief all about it. Several guardians of the
law ambled along and put searching questions
to Johnnie, but were met with a bland pro-
fession of complete ignorance as to his
mother’s whereabouts. At last came a suave
gentleman who chatted most affably to all
the kids, and dealt out lollies galore. He
asked each nipper a few questions, but
Johnnie turned him down cold and stiff.
Later, when his nurse asked him why he
was so rude to the kind gentleman, “Gwan!”
was the surprised response—“couldn’t ye.r
tell from a mile off that he was a cop?”
“Harold Hardupp”: A cable says that
Britain spent £193,000,000 on beer last
vear, as against £93,000,000 on milk.
The message to a friend was shown
Who never in his life was known
An alcoholic thirst to bilk.
“When a big nation’s to be fed
That’s very little beer,” he said—
“ But who the blazes bought the milk?”
BUSINESS BEFORE PLEASURE.
NOODLE ( someone’s husband himself): “If you love her,
old fellow, why don’t you marry her?”
BOODLE (bachelor doctor): “Marry her? Why, she is
one of my best patients!”
“M.M.8.”: I saw it recently chronicled in
The Bulletin that the figurehead of the
clipper Samuel Plimsoll is preserved in the
Perth museum. It seems worth adding that
the bell of the same craft hangs in the
Church of England Girls’ Grammar School
at Geelong (Vic.). It still performs active
service, too, by calling the pupils to lessons
and meals.

“Anaf”: “Macquarie Street” writes di.s-
couragingly on the prospects of women in
the medical profession (B. 24/4/24) ; never-
theless, I believe that the majority of
them in Australia are doing fairly, well. For
some reason Queensland is their favorite
State. Many have remunerative practices
in the country districts; I could name several
who are above the £lOOO-a-year line, and in
the coastal regions there are a few doing
even better. Of the 30 or so who are prac-
tising in Sydney and the suburbs, practi-
cally all are getting at least a decent living,
and the same is the case in the country towns
of N. S. Wales. There are proportionately
more women graduates than men who never
intend to practise because of private means, or
who go in purely for research work; yet ft
is a queer thing that hardly any specialise
in some branch of medicine. I fancy they
lack the confidence to push in among the
heads. But that will pass.
SHE GET!S IT WITH BOTH HANDS!.
“I think the girl who thinks herse If too good for most men is right.”
“Yes —and mostly left, too!”
“Centurion”: “Herodot,” on the margin of
error in military executions (B. l/o/ 24)
due to faulty aiming or tender conscience m
the firing party, is a reminder that the
authorities woke to this weakness fairly early
in the war. After that, all really well-done
executions were carried out with a machine-
gun. The man to be. shot was seated,
strapped or otherwise, in a chair, and a
“short-burst” from the fixed gun brought
merciful extinction.
“C arto t” : J. 11. M.
Abbott’s suggestion that the
name “Australia” should be
perpetuated in the Austra-
lian Navy in the future (B.
17/4/’24) makes no appeal
to me; it looks as if there
was a hoodoo of some kind
on it. The P. and O. Aus-
tralia was wrecked near the
entrance to Port Phillip, the
E. and A. Company’s Aus-
tralia struck a reef in Torres
Strait and is still there, and
the Messageries Maritimes’
Australie ended her career
somewhat similarly. All
these are comparatively
modern happenings ; in years
more remote three or four
other Australias of varying
tonnage have been lost in
one way or another. About
five years ago a New Guinea
syndicate purchased a fine
auxiliary schooner, which
they re-named the Austra-
lia ; three months later she
caught fire while at her an-
chorage, and was burned to
the water’s edge in a few
minutes.
Ida Dawson’s note from the Argentine:—
Leonard Matters’s par. (B. 29/11/’23) advocating
the introduction of yerba and the mate-drinking
habit to Australia incites me to second him, and
also recommend two other Argentine customs which
should suit our climate well. The first is the more
extensive use of olive oil. In cooking fish and the
various omelettes it here takes the place of butter or
dripping, and is tasteless; with the addition of
vinegar, pepper and salt it makes a dressing for
the S’American salads and boiled vegetables. On
hot summer days, when the national (and standard
daily) dish, puchero, is placed before one, and
the appetite is not much tempted, a sprinkling of
oil and vinegar gives the necessary relish. Puchero
is beef or muttcn and every vegetable available
boiled in a pot, and brought to table in one dish.
A well-made Argentine puchero is not to be despised.
The second custom is that of drinking in the open
air, instead of in bars. Everywhere in Buenos Ayres
one sees under awnings, or under trees on the pave-
ments fronting the wine saloons, a double row of
chairs and tables whereat groups sit and chat while
they drink their wine or beer, or eat ices (the
Argentines are great on ices), making it a pleasant
social custom instead of something to be done behind
closed doors. I have not seen a drunk in Buenos
Ayres, yet in every street are to be seen these
open-air cafes.
“Yacko” among the fathers of our Navy:
I suggest that the distinction of having built the
first sea-craft in Australia (B. 27/3/’24) belongs
to the Dutch crew of the Zeewyck, wrecked on the
Abrolhos (W.a.) in 1727. They got away to Batavia
in a sloop they managed to knock together out of
the remnants of their
vessel. The schooner
Providence, built by
Raven’s men at
Dusky Sound (M.L.)
in 1792, was launched
three years later by
some of the crew of
the abandoned En-
deavor, and in com-
pany with the Fancy
she sailed for Norfolk
Island. The men left
behind built a 60-ton
boat, the Assistance,
and reached Sydney
the day after they
had exhausted their
food supply. Though
roughly constructed
and leaky, the Assist-
ance found a buyer at
£250. The first Syd-
ney boat built of local
timber (Oct., 1789)
was known as the
Lump, and was chiefly
used for lightering.
The only vessel, a 25-
ton schooner, which
early Norfolk Island
could claim as her own
was christened the Nor-
folk, and was launched
in May, 1798. It was
in this craft a few
months later that
Flinders and Bass cir-
cumnavigated Tas-
mania. Sydney’s first
vessel of dimensions
fit for deep-sea going
was the armed schooner Cumberland, 29 tons, des-
tined in 1803 to carry Flinders to his long exile on
Mauritius.
“The Rumpus”: A recent cable featured
the grief of Paderewski, pianist and ex-
President, at the death of his dog. One
may wonder whether he would have done
as much for it as some young and totally
undistinguished Australians are prepared to
do for their four-footed and generally quite
unpedigreed favorites. At Perth on Easter
Sunday a boy, in a desperate attempt to
save his Towser from being rqn over by a
motor-lorry, was himself hit and killed. Curi-
ously enough, there was a second tragedy
directly due to dog on the same day. A lad
threw stones at a dog because, the animal
annoyed him whilst he was bicycle-riding,
and the owner promptly engaged the stone-
thrower with his fists. According to the
statement of the first boy, they were both
fighting hard when he hit his adversary in
the face, and the blow proved fatal.
“Flicker”: The luck of the man on the jag!
At the Goodwood (Adelaide) police court a
man was charged with “being drunk while in
charge of a motor-car” —there was a minor
charge of trespassing on railway property,
and the story of his hilarious drive sounded
like the boost of a new Yankee film. One
evening about f) o’clock he tired of the prosaic
roadway, and dashed into the railway goods-
yards at Mile End. After indulging in some
fancy stunts he set off along the main South
line —the Adelaide to Melbourne track—
and drove for about two miles on the perma-
nent-way, taking cattle-pits in his stride and
bellowing cheerful greetings to two trains
which passed him on the opposite set of rails.
At Goodwood crossing he halted —possibly to
invite the horrified signalman to a crayfish
supper—and was removed from the track by
perspiring officials about two minutes before
a southern train flashed down the rails. In
the circumstances a tenner fine and the sus-
pension of his license for three months ought
to have struck the offender as a very reason-
able penalty.
* * * *
“Oxmead” : “You wouldn’t be game to do
the job yourself; you’ve got to hire a dirty
pervert to do it,” remarked one of the speak-
ers at the deputation which sought to get
Premier Fuller to commute the death sen-
tence on Williams. Yet if Williams hadn’t
been hanged he would have been imprisoned
for the term of his natural life, and the
speaker, being a Labor politician, would
probably be indignant if it were suggested
that all the gaolers and warders engaged in
depriving the man until he dies of every-
thing that makes life worth living were
tarred with the brush of “dirty perversion.”
If killing a murderer legally, however atro-
cious his crime may have been, can never be
anything less than a loathsome and degrad-
ing job, why is it that no taint is held to
attach to those who co-operate, as servants
of the State, in legally torturing a criminal
—what less is it?—by keeping him behind
bars and within walls for 20 or 30 years?
I’m not putting in a word for the hangman,
albeit he receives all the obloquy for killing
a man whom the Law has decided is unfit
to live, and law-makers, Judges, Crown
Prosecutors, juries, police, detectives,
sheriffs, gaolers, warders, gallows-builders
and the rest none at all. But it does puzzle
me that there is not a scrap left over for
the instruments of the Law whose business
is to indict any punishment, however pro-
tracted, that stops short of breaking the
malefactor’s neck.
* * * *
“Machete”: As to the best method of
carrying a pistol to ensure a speedy
draw (B. 24/4/’24). I once spent a period
of Cape Town leave with a party of Stratli-
cona’s Horse, all Western Canadian bor-
derers, and found they pinned faith to the left
armpit. The long 44’s of the period were
easily concealed there; the flat automatics
which, I am given to understand, are most
favored by expert gunmen nowadays, should
be hidden even easier. But a later innova-
tion is credited to “Bat” Masterson, who
succeeded “Wild Bill” Hickock as Sheriff
of Tombstone City, Arizona. He was a mild
little man, and his practice was to carry two
guns down the front of his trousers. If an
argument started “Bat” never made the dan-
gerous move to the hip expected by his oppo-
nents, but nervously slipped both hands under
his vest and down his pants —a very common
trick with Australian bushmen to-day.
Whether standing or sitting, the adversary
was always liable to take two bullets through
the abdomen.
“Herodot”: I suggest that it is only in
books and on the pictures that American gun-
men carry revolvers in their hip-pockets (B.
24/4/’24) ; in real life the bad man keeps
the wcapon under the armpit or tucked into
the belt, between trousers and shirt. It may
not be more accessible, but it comes clear
much more easily. The Australian gunman
affects the coat side-pocket, from which he
can fire without drawing, although this is not
good for the coat, and sometimes it is un-
healthy for the wearer. When the Fitzroy

vendetta was at its height one of the feudists
was thoughtless enough to appear in a bil-
liard-saloon wearing a raincoat, and with his
hands in the pockets. He happened to be
unarmed at the time, but the enemy had been
caught that way before and were taking no
chances. Therefore they got in first, and he
went to the hospital.

ITEMS
Next year the P.M.G. will be looking for
new deputy-chiefs in all of the States, bar
South Aus. Charles E. Bright (Vic.), the
first to retire, goes to a comfortable farm at
Frankston. Seventeen years ago he was
fished out of the deputy’s chair in Brisbane
by P.M.G. Mauger and told to grease the
wheels of the Vic. postal service, which were
then creaking badly. Bright is descended
from a prominent Cromwellian colonel and
the brilliant engineer, Sir Charles Tilson
Bright, who laid the first ocean cable between
Newfoundland and Ireland. He inherited a
bag of money, and long ago could have put
his official vexations aside and lived on a
handsome income.
“The Deacon” : Arthur McHugh, the R.C.
chaplain who attended Williams, the Pad-
dington child-slayer, in Long Bay Gaol, is
a good dyed-in-the-wool Australian. His
father was Patrick McHugh, who laid the

Sussex-street the
business is now in

of the other sons—
and he is a pro-
duct of the Chris-
tian Brothers’
High School at
Lewisham
(N.S.W.), a pro-
lific nursery for
R.C. padres.
McHugh, who is
a particularly
active member of
that hete noir of
the Irish clergy,
the militant Manly
Old Boys’ Union,
is a talented musi-
cian and a man
with big human
sympathies.
John Bowser, who becomes the 13th
Speaker of Vic. Assembly, owns and edits
the Wangaratta Chronicle. He is not the
first Inky Wayfarer to sit in the chair;
Charles Gavan Duffy did some writing in
Ireland as well as in Vic., and Graham
Berry had an interest in one of the Gee-
long papers when he was well on his way
to be the People’s Tribune. With all his
culture and 30 years’ experience in the
House, Bowser has a shyness he cannot con-
quer, and his hand shook with obvious ner-
vousness when he spoke for the first time on
the Speaker’s dais.
Archbish. Duhig, of Brisbane, who has put
up a proposition for child endowment to the
Theodore Government, is Irish-born, though
Australia caught him young. His first port-
folio was in a Queensland butcher’s shop,
where the pious young writer of a clerkly
hand attracted the notice of the late Arch-
bishop Dunne, who later sent him to one of
the vacant bursaries of the Missionary Col-
lege of the Propaganda at Rome, and in the
fulness of time appointed him second in com-
mand in Brisbane. Thence he was assisted
to the Rockhampton see when Bishop Hig-
gins, one-time coadjutor to Cardinal Moran,
was translated to Ballarat (Vic.). Finally,
when extreme old age forced Dr. Dunne to
call it a day, he had Duhig appointed his
coadjutor, with right of succession. With
some reluctance Duhig accepted the northern
job: till then he had dreamed of ruling in
Sydney.
“Te Pana”: One of the results of early
missionary efforts in Tonga was a serious
split in the ranks of the Wesleyan Church
and the establishment of the Tongan Free
Church, Shirley Waldemar Baker being

Sidney Kidman and Joseph Timms have
sold a big batch of their West Darling sta-
tions. The auction was at Broken Hill. John
Tennant bought Hamilton and Capon sta-
tions at 2s. 51d. an acre; also Mount Mur-
chison, a big place with 50 miles of river
frontage, at Is. 9d. Sid Reid, who is Kid-
man’s son-in-law, got Purnanga at 6|d.;
also, at Is 1-Jd., the biggest proposition of the
lot, Momba, 658,000 acres, with from 3000
to 4000 head of mixed cattle and 150 horses.
The total acreage sold was nearly 1,400,000,
all leasehold land except 5000 acres of Mount
Murchison; and the total price paid was
£70,000.
“Rienzi”: Ballarat College, which cele-
brates its diamond jubilee next month, sup-
plied officers for each of the first four bat-
talions that left Australia in 1914. An old
boy was the first Aussie to capture the D.S.O.
against Abdul Fez, and another was one of
the two officers who dodged the shrapnel and
clambered up to their objectives at the Land-
ing. An ancient desk formerly showed the
initials “G.G.,” which are a memento of Guy
Gaunt, one of the two Australians to reach
flag-rank in the British Navy. The extra-
ordinarily versatile Arthur Lynch, whose
variegated career included a term in the
House of Commons, also pursued Caesar
through “De Bello Gallico” in the old school.
“Pohutu”: Another master in the identi-
fication of coastline was old John Bernech,
who for years commanded the U.S.S. Talitne.
John was an Austrian, with only a coastal-
master’s ticket and an indifferent knowledge
of English, but he knew every lump between
the Bluff and North Cape. Once when be
was feeling his way up the M.L. east coast
in a thick fog, a passenger asked him where
they were. “I t’ink ver’ near der Boverty
Bay. I vait to ’ear der bleats of der
sheeps. Dey speak different to der sheeps
at Dunedin—nod so Scotch.”
J. 11. Betheras, who has stepped into
Alfred Fussell’s shoes as Chief Inspector
of the Education Department (Vic.), is an
upstanding veteran athlete who has led the
physical-training movement since Tate intro-
duced it. He comes from a Cousin Jack
clan that was on the Jim Crow diggings
(now Daylesford) back in the ’fifties. In
those days the Betheras brothers were known
as giants among men, skilled boxers, cham-
pion Cornish wrestlers and untiring and
skilful workers. One, Jack, had an uncanny
skill with his fists, but got converted, and
gave up pugilism. Shortly after that hap-
pened a middle-weight champion landed in
the diggings looking for him, and kicked
at his door one midnight. Jack rose to ex-
plain from liis side of the door that he’d
got religion. “Azackly,” rumbled the
bruiser; “ ’eard of me cornin’ —and made
for the penitent form.” This was too much
for Betheras; he sallied forth, a fearsome
object in a flannel nightgown, and belted
his visitor through every door of the house,
ending by pitching him out the back. After
that he carefully gathered up his battered
adversary, carried him inside and lovingly
tended his injuries. The “champion” ex-
plained afterwards that he didn’t mind the
hammering; but he reckoned it the dizzy
limit when the big Cornishman prayed with
him and asked his forgiveness. The present
second in command of the youth of Vie. is a
polished replica of his fine old hard-fisted
ancestors.
Jack Bean, M.D., who as general sec. for
Australia has since he came back from the
war steered the Theosophical ship through
more or less turbulent waters, resigned the
other day and handed the office over to
Josephine Ransom. The latter left Armi-
dale (N.S.W.), her native town, 20 years
ago, as Jo Davies, and in England edited
and managed Theosophical magazines,
wrote books on educational philosophy, lec-
tured on psychology, and sat in conclave with
Indian reformers at the House of Commons.
Incidentally, she married Sidney Ransom,
a Government official now at Pretoria, and
passed on some of her capacity to a daughter
who is studying at Retch worth. Bean, after
contributing brains, money and influence to
Theosophy, returns to medicine. He is a
brother of Charlie Bean, the official war cor-
respondent, and, like that long rufous scrib-
bler, is beloved for his chivalry and idealism.
H. T. Wilson, who, as general-manager, has
made the Royal Bank carry a high head
for many years, took into retirement with
him the other day an illuminated address
from the staff, with a blackwood casket to
keep the dust off it.
“Ex-Dig”: The youngest soldier in the
war was probably John Llewellyn Pugh, who
saw fighting with the A.1.F., although not
on its strength, when he was 13; but the
youngest nurse was almost certainly a lady
who died at Coonabarabran (N.S.W.) last
week. At 16 she was serving in a hospital
in France, and she went right through the
Avar, subsequently marrying a Digger, Frank
Wilkins, with whom she came to Australia.
She Avas a god-daughter of Lord French,
and only 25 when she died.
William Ness, a retired dairy-farmer on
the N.S.W. North Coast, Avas an engineer on
the cable ship Edinburgh, which in company
with the Hibernian laid the cable from La
Perouse to Blind Bay (M.L.) in 1883. In
a H, 1700 miles of cable was used, and the
ships met halfway and spliced up the ends.
Before going doAvn to the sea in ships, Ness
was a railway-engine driver in Scotland.
I °rsaking blue water again, he joined the
N.S.W. railway service 40 years ago,
and stayed there six years, mostly on the
Mountain section. It was a long day’s run
in those days from Redfern to Bathurst, on
a single track, Avith the chances of a head-
on collision never quite negligible. Ness had
one, but came through safely.
“Skyrider”: W. J. Bartlett laid the foun-
dation stone of the Goulburn (N.S.W.)
War Memorial on Anzac Day. The table-
lands city has waited a good many years for
its monument to the Diggers, and would
probably be still marking time if it had
not been for William J., who bought 40
acres of land surrounding the city’s most
prominent hill, handed over the place to the
council, and told it to get on with the job.
In addition, he planked down £lOO towards
the memorial and spent the same amount in
the laying out of a road through the new
park. Though he is 85, he climbed the rocky
hill as nimbly as the rest of the big crowd,
among Avhom were many Anzacs. “Bill”
Bartlett is an old man-o’-Avar’s man, and was
with the fleet in Russian waters when the
British took Sabastopol. For many years
now he has been turning out a highly-
regarded brand of stout; he attributes his
youthfulness to a daily glass of it.
Sydney Grammar is able to puff out its
chest this year, not only over winning the
eights, but because of the brilliant work of
two old boys who came first and second in
the finals in Medicine. M. S. Earlam headed
the list; J W. S. Laidley was on his heels.
Their student career has been a neck-and-
neck race; they have cut up most of the
prizes between them.
“H.S.” on sovereigns and centaurs:—
Charles Sims, R.A., is being attacked for what
London Daily Express calls “his astounding portrait
of the King-”-—a picture which is said to present the
Sovereign as “a short-sighted man, with pale and
undistinguished features.” Sims’s defence is virtu-
ally that that is what the King looks like: he has
followed the Cromwellian precedent and “put in the
warts.” It will be a historical as well as an artistic
boon if this episode leads to honesty in portraiture
where eminent persons are concerned. One of the
most frightful examples of sculptural mendacity (the
modern sculptor is an even more shameless flunkey
than the painter) is provided by the equestrian
statue of Edward VII. near the gates of Sydney
Government House. Edward never looked more im-
pressive than a sandbag on a horse: he Avill go
down to posterity as a centaur. The statue of
\ ntoria at the other end of Macquarie-street is
equally untruthful. Now that the cinema is con-
tinually showing elderly royalties as they are, it
merely tends to make fools of the dynasty to present
them as Ajax-like figures endowed with the com-
plexion and eyes of one who has successfully under-
gone the Voronofif treatment.

cable, has been lecturing in Copenhagen on
“Plastic Surgery,” and has received the glad
hand of Denmark’s Sovereign, is ah illus-

Two good Adelaide men closely related to
each other have died within a few days. Dr.
Melville Birks, who went out comparatively
young to a lingering illness, did his best work
as superintendent of Broken Hill Hospital,
The other was Charles Birks, his uncle, who
came to. Australia 70 years ago as a boy of
10, and in 1864 started in drapery in Hindley-
street. Later, foreseeing a future for Rundle-
street, he shifted thither (though his partner
of the moment declined to “go exploring”),
and built up the big Birks business which has
latterly been run by a company.
Dr. G. B. Pritchard, of Melbourne ’Varsity
and Working Men’s College, and one of the
world’s authorities on fossils, is going to a
well-gilded appointment in the U.S.A. He
met a group of American geologists at the
Pacific Science Congress last year, and his
departure for the land of flivvers and oil
deals is probably the result of that meeting.
He will be missed by Harry Connolly, who
formed the Torquay Oil Wells Co. and the
Point Adds Oil Co., to bore at Torquay
(Vic.), upon reports made by Pritchard,
who is a sturdy believer in the existence o'
petroleum in Australia.
Capt. T. E. Wardle, the new commander
of the R.A.N., who will hoist the pennant of
a first-class commodore on the Melbourne,
played the chief part in the historic scrap
between the auxiliary cruiser Alcantara and
the German raider Greif, in 1916, which re-
sulted in both craft going to the bottom.
The British skipper was swimming for
nearly half an hour before he was rescued
by a light cruiser. In the North Sea he was
afterwards in command of a unit in the 10th
Cruiser Squadron, under Admiral de Chair,
now Governor of the Ma State.
John Anderson, of Brighton Beach (Vic.),
who passed his 92nd milestone last week, used
to turn out hand-made bricks on part of the
Kew Asylum lands in the ’fifties. For a
while he was foreman to Melba’s dad, David
Mitchell, in building-construction work, and
afterwards branched out on his own as a
contractor.
“One of Them”: The late George Mac-
donald, of Glendarriwell (Vic.), was not the
only survivor of this long-lived family, as
suggested by “Adamascus” (B. 24/4/’24).
There are still two sisters living, both hale
and hearty—Mrs. Ramsay, of Epping
(N.S.W.), and Airs. Mclvor, who is at pre-
sent visiting South Africa.
J. S. Rogers, M.A., M.Sc., a returned sol-
dier, who graduated in Melbourne, has been
appointed lecturer on natural philosophy by
his Alma Mater. Rogers won two scientific
research scholarships in London, besides the
Dixon and Kernot bursaries in Melbourne.
He studied under that brilliant Maorilander,
Ernest Rutherford, and gained the degree of
Doctor of Chemistry at Cambridge. Among
other things he is an authority on radio-
activity. And 32.
The nation-builders who secured for
N.S.W. her Constitution have long been dust;
but there still lives a man who had some
hand in the affair. Born in 1834 in then
fashionable Goulburn-street, the son of a
skipper who had arrived nine years before
and set up as a surveyor, Edward Knapp,
because of a prize he had earned at school
for handwriting, was given by Wentworth
the job of transcribing the petition from
the Council to Queen Victoria which resulted
in the introduction of representative govern-
ment in Australia. Mr. Knapp received his
own surveyor’s certificate in 1863.
SITTING TIGHT.
[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
“Mr. Nesbitt, Sydney’s Town Clerk, states ‘without
the slightest hesitation’ that he refuses to surrender
his job under the compulsion applied by 18 aider-
men ; he will resign when he thinks fit.”
Your Baldwin or Ramsay MacD.,
Your Barwell, your Bruce or your Hughes
Can never afford to decree
They’ll go whensoever they choose.
A Premier can hardly refuse
A definite notice to quit
As soon as he finds that he’s been undermined
And a crucial division has left him behind.
But Nesbitt will not
From his billet be shot
Till he deems that the moment is fit.
They may clamor around him and chide,
A surging and ravening swarm,
Grim bloodhounds of Labor allied
With mastiffs of Civic Reform;
They may threaten and bluster and storm,
He won’t be affected a bit.
They may holler and whoop like a vaudeville troop,
But they won't make him fly the municipal coop ;
He’ll never be stirred,
This downy old bird,
From his perch till he reckons it fit.
They may howl like a ravening pack
Of merciless wolves for his gore;
They may press on his notice the sack
In signed requisitions galore—
In truth they have done it before
But when did they know him submit
To Bumbles’ duress or to yells in the press?'
You take it from me that he won’t acquiesce;
In fine, to resign
Will flatly decline
Till he thinks such a course would be fit.

Parama”: “C. Coral’s” way of putting
things re deep diving (B. 10/4/’24) may be mis-
leading. Even with dress-divers anything over 30
fathoms is not sought for. He says that in Torres
Strait the dress-divers do their 40 or so, and
adds: “With the respirator they’ve been down to well
approaching 50. I don't say it’s healthy; but it’s
done.” This sounds as though these depths were
done daily. The dress-divers are practically all
Japs, and the Jap is a fatalist. He doesn’t go
out of his way to find trouble for himself, but
THE REAL CURSE OF EVE.
“Going down for the grand-opera season, darling?”
"What a thing to ask! You know very well I haven’t a thing
to go in.”
when there’s any about he doesn’t think it worth
while trying to avoid it. Tell “C. Coral” to read
—if he understands Japanese—some of the scores of
posts marking the graves of Jap deep-water dress-
divers who have been taken ashore on Darnley
Island and buried in the graveyard on the hill
behind the mission station. Most of the islands
have similar proof of what the 40-fathom dive
means. I’ve seen the ' “boys” hauled up, sometimes,
dead, sometimes as good as dead, from close up to
the 40-fathom depth, which they had risked after
trying the shallower beds without success. Divers’
paralysis is the certain result of these deep dives,
and those who do live after a bad dose of that
would be better dead. That’s why anything over
30 fathoms is left alone if the lugger can possibly
be filled up with shell collected from shallower
depths, even though the quality and size may not
be quite up to the deeper-water stuff.
“Bad Australian”: I know nothing about
those Western District (Vic.) Anglo-Indian officers
mentioned by “H.W.” (B. 10/4/’24), but I had
one for a neighbor at Mentone. Among other live
stock he had a lot of white leghorn pullets penned
in a corner of the paddock. He had made no pro-
vision in the way of nests for the birds, and, notic-
ing a couple of eggs on the ground, I mentioned the
matter to him. He waved a gardening glove at me
in a deprecating manner, and replied: “Eggs? No,
no. Mai deah old chap, you raly mustn’t try to put
that ovah me. Whai, Ai haven’t put the bally
roostah with them yet, y’know!”
* * * *
“Werrimee”: Here’s an entry for the
longest mob of cattle not hemmed in a lane. The
beef hailed from Kini (Q.) and were bound for Mus-
wellbrook (N.S.W.) in charge of drover Cassidy.
There was no feed till the Barcoo was left behind,
consequently a big proportion of the mob was tottery.
Good grass began about 10 miles out from Tambo,
and the object was to get the starved brutes there
as quickly as they liked to stretch out for it. The
leaders were on the grass before the tail of the mob
had got three miles from Tambo. A squatter’s
wife, driving in from Landsdowne, remarked witn
astonishment that she had never seen a seven-mile
mob of cattle in her life before.
“Micalo”: “Cobba Cobba” (B. 20/3/’2I)
puts forward yet another cure for banana borer in
Queensland in the shape of the centipede. One
cannot help wondering how he saw the centipedes
devouring the beetle larva, for anyone who has had
to battle with this pest knows that the grubs lire
their whole life inside the plant, and that their
tunnels are so tightly packed with waste fibre, etc.,
as to make the task of coming up with the grub
a pretty tall order, even if the predator could squeeze
himself into the small burrow. I have met with
many centipedes in old rotting butts and stems
with any number of the beetles close handy, out
the ’pedes did not appear to regard the “hard backs'’
as an epicurean dish. Does “Cobba Cobba” know
anything about the banana borer himself, or is his
information umpteenth hand?
* * * *
“E.S.S.” : If some adequate protection is
not soon given, the dugong will be gone from
our northern shores as completely as it has from
Botany Bay. Long ago it swam in those southern
waters, as evidenced by a deeply-embedded skeleton
that was dug up a few years ago at Cook’s River.
There is no denizen of the sea more interesting than
the dugong, from which originated the old-time
tales of mermaids and sirens. Its family name
is sirenia. Seen when it rises gracefully out of
the water to breathe, with its breasts in the position
of a woman’s, and its baby held under the flipper,
one can easily understand the ancient mariner’s
belief in mermaids; and it would be a great pity to
allow the old woman of the sea to be exterminated.
* * * *
Herodot ’: Not long ago an amateur
fisherman landed a fine big cat-fish from an out-
back (N.S.W.) dam, and was removing the hook
from its jaws when he
received an electric
shock which all but
knocked him over. His
companions laughed at
his statement that the
shock had come from
the fish, and one of
them touched it in dis-
belief, whereupon a
shock also went through
his hand and arm, but
of a much less severe
nature. A third, on
placing the tips of
his fingers on the fish
about 10 minutes later,
could feel only a gentle
tingle at first, and
after a minute or so
even that could not be
noticed, the electricity
in the fish apparently
having been exhausted.
Subsequently the hand,
arm and shoulder of
the first man became
swollen and extremely
painful, and remained
in that state until the
next morning, accom-
panied by feverishness
and restlessness in the
victim. Electric eels
are, of course, well
known, and even a
lizard capable of giv-
ing a shock has been
reported, but this is the first I’ve heard of a fish

“Nitric”: Tell “Hope On” (B 10/4 /’94\
that those three potatoes of his weighing 111 b. are
maibles compared with some exhibited here (Killar
ney, Q.) last show time. Two of them scaled over
4 b. each, and a freak “double” one weighed nearly
51b. The Bft. stalks mentioned are a record, I should
say, but Hope On” is surely referring to sweet-
potato stalks, which are usually cut back to give
the fruit a chance. I lately visited the farm of
my friend 0 Toole and remarked on the curious-lookino-
outsize cow-pumpkin in his yard. “Get away wid
Yf’ he nitorted. “That’s a swate spud. It’s the
5 f p V k Se f?> ° U L iV ° ireland and as ‘lean as the
?° Ul , . , abl i lC ?- But 1 thought they grew only
English” potatoes in Ireli nd. .
“IOZ”: Tell “Oxmead” (B. 13/3/’24)
that if he likes to go up the Georgina (Q.) he will
see plenty of camels semi-wild on some of the
stations. They are apparently doing well, so much
so that on one run that I know of they are being
shot to keep their numbers down. I have seen as
many as a hundred in one mob—all sizes, from
calves to old bulls. Though “Oxmead” seems doubt-
ful whether camels would take kindly to the Aus-
tralian bush, they at any rate apparently like
the Georgina country.
THE CURIOSITY OF THE SEX.
MRS. H OGGAN: “Shure, phwat’s wrong wid yez, Mrs. Riley?”
MRS. RILEY ( dejectedly ): “Oi don't know. The docther says only
a post-mortem will tell, that, Mrs. Hogan.”
MRS. HOGAN: "Faith; poor darlint! Oi suppose yez are anxious
to git it over.”
“Min Yip”: “Helegraf’s” par. (B.
S/4/’24) re Mulligan’s experiment with an over-
charge of ballistite in a rifle reminds me of an
experience I had with Walsrode smokeless powder
nearly 30 years ago. I was using a 12-bore shotgun,
firing from the shoulder, and was testing the choke
barrel at an object about 60yds. distant. As I pulled
the trigger there was a violent explosion and t
dropped the barrels on one side and the stock on
the other of a sod fence on which I was standing at
the time. I escaped unhurt excepting for a small
splinter of wood which punctured the palm of my
hand. The breech block was torn off ■ and hurled
about 60yds. past my head, both locks were burst
out, the trigger-guard and top straps were broken
where they were fastened to the stock with screws,
the stock was blown to matchwood right up to
the grip, and the left barrel was blistered just be-
yond the chamber. On investigating I found that
my brother, who had loaded the shells, had put in
50 grains instead of 40. Anyone loading his own
cartridges should be careful when using nitro powders
to have the exact quantity, as a few grains over
are liable to burst any gun. This does not apply
to black powder, which if overloaded in a shotgun
will merely give a bad pattern, and in a rifle will
render your sights useless unless adapted to quantity
used. I once as a boy tried to burst an old Enfield
muzzle-loading rifle with black powder, using a lan-
yard to pull the trigger, but I did not succeed.
Most of the powder, I learned afterwards, would be
blown out of the barrel before ignition.
“F.A.”: Re record sheep journeys (B.
10/4/’24). I was in the trucking yards at Carra-
thool (N.S.W.) one evening at about 6 o’clock
yarning to the manager of a run up on the Lach-
lan. Ive got a mob of ewes coming in about
2 o’clock to-morrow afternoon to be trucked,” he
said, “and I just came along to have a look at
the, yards and see how the accommodation would
be.” Just as he finished speaking a cloud of dust
showed up on the other side of the line. “Dammit 1”
he spluttered, “here’s another mob —I thought I’d
have the yards to myself.” In another five minutes
he was mounted cn the rails and making the
welkin ring with rude remarks. The lads who were
droving his jumbucks had brought them in from
Gunbar town (28 miles) since daylight. They lost
30 sheep—and their jobs.
* * * *
“430”: Whether cats like swimming or
not, there is a kitten at Long Bay Gaol (Sydney)
which makes a regular practice of taking a Turkish
bath first thing in the morning. Just outside the
cookhouse there is a grating through which steam
emerges from a condenser, and the young puss has
made the discovery that it is warmer on cold mornings
to sit in the escaping steam than in the ineffectual
rays of the belated sun. Any morning you—meaning
no offence —may see her cuddled up in a cloud of
steam, whilst mamma cat and the rest of the family
look on askance from a safe and steamless distance.
This performance usually lasts till about 9 a.m., by
which time the combined effect of sun and steam
must become rather stifling. Something resembling
a dazed dishcloth then emerges from the steam and
sits in the sun to dry. Mamma cat inspects this
sorry little bundle distastefully, and finally lends a
helping tongue to lick her bedraggled offspring back
to respectability.
“Perdix”: I’m with “Wax” (B. 3/4/’24)
when he says it is rot to talk of never finding a
platypus in shallow water. When a youngster I
caught many by trapping, and an ideal place to set
the trap was at the junction of two shallow creeks.
Again, I recently tossed one out of water only a
few inches deep, as he was having a snack, at 11 a.m.
* * * *
“Ragar”: Re dog defending dog against
man (“Uramao,” B. 10/4/’24), it’s always a toss-up
whether another dog, seeing the row, goes for the
man or the tyae.
When I punished an
Irish terrier for theft
and he retired howl-
ing across the yard,
his half-brother took
a hand in the game,
and it was all I could
do to pvll him off
his already-whipped
cobber. Another time
I gave a foxie a lick-
ing for persisting in
chasing a neighbor's
cat, and, as he yelped
his indignation for all
the world to hear,
three ordinary dorgs
of no particular breed
converged on him
from three different
directions and rolled
into him. Only once
has a dog turned cn
me for hurting an-
other, and that was
when I stumbled over
a sleeping mongrel in
the path and kicked
him to relieve my
feelings. As he let
out a startled yowl
another dog ' appeared
from somewhere and
sampled the calf of
my leg. Dogs will at
times start to flgnt
among themselves
when they hear other
dogs fight, or some
dog in distress, even
though they cannot see
the disturber of the
peace. It looks rather as though the ordinary
t.oig easily flies off the handle and goes for
whatever is on the spot, regardless of the rights or
wrongs of the case.
“To Babarantiko”: I don’t mind telling
Dobjc (B. 10/4/’24) that I am the best shot I
ever knew. One of my most brilliant performances
was put up at Cardiff (Old ,South Wales). After
I had picked off empty eggshells bobbing and leap-
ing on a jet of water, the broad-hipped Cockney
proprietress of the gallery, possibly in fear of
running short of blown eggs, and because each hit
meant a free shot, suggested that I should turn the
lifle on to the empty bottles standing on tiers of
long shelves against a wall. I did, and at the
first shot all the shelves and every bottle came to
the ground in one almighty smash. It was like
a scene in a cinema story, though movies were
then unknown. Harriet feelingly and emphatically
recorded that she’d never seen “another blanky
blank shot” like me; and I seconded the motion.
* * * *
Caesar” : A while back some remarkably
precocious heifers were featured by the Council; but
one has turned up at Logan Village (Q.) that has
easily broken all records. She is a purebred Jersey
owned by a local farmer, and she began making
eyes at the gentleman of the herd at three and a

Now, at nine months, she is giving two quarts of
milk a day, and it is impossible to dry her off.
Does anyone know of a similar case of an uncalvcd
heifer milking ?

THE HAUNTED HIGHWAY.
[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
As down the road to Windsor
I walked a long day through,
My fancy went a-roving
As Fancy loves to do.
I did not see as others,
Nor hear as other men ;
Things dead and gone and buried,
They rose in dreams again.
Oh, strange and quaint the pictures
That Vision can reveal!
I saw not car nor horseman,
I heard not hoof nor wheel.
I saw but bygone people
That stood at wayside doors,
To watch and cheer the passing
Of old-time Governors.
All glittering were the bridles,
The sword-hilts and the spurs,
And nigh them gravely cantered
Red tuniced officers.
With shoulder knots and sword-belts
Oh, bright and brave they showed 1
Yet further west than Windsor
They all have ta’en the road.
Yet if you’ll let your Fancy,
As I did, have its will,
A down that haunted highway
You’ll see them riding still.

design of rear suspension accounts for that. It starts
instantly in any weather. Steers easily as a bicycle.
Gears shift noiselessly at a touch. It has HUDSON type
crankshaft, clutch, transmission and axles.
Even those who keep but casual track of petrol mileage
are astonished at its economy in this respect, and many
owners report mileages ranging from 26 to 30 miles per
gallon.

Flinders River’ : Recently, while muster-
ing sheep along' the Flinders (N.Q.), I witnessed
the very unusual spectacle of two kangaroos fighting.
I noticed them first from a ridge about 300 yards away,
and at that distance it looked as if they were embrac-
ing each other, swaying from side to side, then
parting and immediately coming together again. I
watched them for about lo minutes, and then
decided to try to get a closer view. Keeping a
clump oi supple-jacks between them and myself, 1
was able to ride to within 15 yards of them. The
pugilists, both big fellows, were very evenly matched.
One, a red, seemed to be bent upon getting some
hold on his opponent, who very effectively countered
by throwing his head well back, balancing himself
neatly on his tail, and poking his legs sharply into
Big Red s tummy—in fact, using him as a sort of
kickboard. Then, locked together, they would
struggle and sway until they fell over. They must
have been fighting some considerable time before I
spotted them, for they were both breathing heavily,
though neither showed any signs of weakening. 1
cannot decide which of the two would ultimately
have won, as they both appeared to give as good as
they received, but my fool horse blew his nose
and the argument was suddenly adjourned.
Liss : It doesn’t always require the
stagger-weed which “Nitric” (B. 27/3/’24) mentions
to knock out travelling sheep. If, after a shower
of ram, starving stock are allowed to gallop from
puddle to puddle and from tussock to tussock, they
are liable to develop staggers and die in an alarm-
ingly short space of time. It is a curious fact that
this usually occurs on black-soil country. Why?
Pedro : That the Samoan calls the soul-
saver “missinaly,” as recorded by “Te Pana” (B.
17/4/’24), instances his lingual "dissimilarity from
his blood-brother the Maori. They speak the same
language with variations, which have been curi-
ously induced by differences of environment. The
Samoan man is a “kanaka” ; the Maori is “tangata.”
The Maori equivalent of Binghi’s bunyip is, or was
THE STOWAWAY.
AIRMAN: “Struth! No wonder I’m top-heavy. Hop
off or I’ll make it warm for yon when I get
yon down.”
iii less sophisticated times, the “taniwha,” a fear-
some, never-seen beast legended to li\'e in water , or
near water, and to make a shark look a pacifist by
comparison. In Samoa there is some sort of little
shark that is found in pools, the “tanifa.” Kangi
seems to have lost his f’s after arriving in Maori-
land, also his w's and l’ s, and to have settled down
to use only the harsher and easier consonants, such
as the abrupts and gutturals. He couldn't say
“tanifa” now, because the / would be beyond him.
As for “missinaly” he would be twice biocked, by
the * and the l. His inability to wrap his tongue
round consonantal liquids and sibilants explains
why it was a standard joke, during my young time
in a semi-Maori town, to ask Hone to say “split six-
pence,” and quite safe to offer him what he called
“hickapenny” to do it.
“Larry Longun”: I don’t know whether
iodide ot potassium will cure swamp cancer on
horses, as claimed by “H.L.S.” (B. 27/3/’24) ; but
I’ve heard of cures being effected by the use of
aisenic. This is merely dusted on the growth from
time to time, the poison seeming to eat the cancer
away. Care, however, must be taken not to apply
the remedy too thickly and at too frequent intervals,
as arsenic is a blood poison. Warts on either cattle
or horses can also be successfully removed by arsenic;
but, as in the case of swamp cancer, the treatment
must not be overdone.
“Saaedi”: I hate to have to suggest it,
but what about insisting that Abo. scribes read a
par. before replying to it? Some of them certainly
need restraining. 1 have in mind the repeated offences
of one “F.A.” in particular. This impetuous pen-
pusher just now rebukes me majestically for stating
(as he says) that barley grass “is confined to black-
soil” (B. 3/4/’24). What I actually said in reference
to Central Western conditions was that “barley
THE MODERN BUSINESS OF BOOST.
Another functionary arrives for duty.
grass thrives on the rich blacksoil plains” (11.
6/3/’24). Now, I put it to the Council for judg-
ment. If I were to state that I thrive in a pub,
would anyone infer that I am never to be found any-
where else, or, for that matter, never thrive any-
where else ?
* * * *
“B. See”: A sft. Gin. black snake was
shot near Perth the other day, and, after being
skinned, the body was placed on a soldier-ants’ nest
in order to procure an unbroken skeleton. Two
days later the bones had been plucked clean. There
is nothing unusual about that; but what I want to
know is: What did the ants do with the meat? Did
they eat it at once or store it away for winter? And
if they placed it in storage, how do they preserve it ?
I haven’t found anyone game to dig deep enough into
a soldier-ants’ nest to find the answer.
* * * *
Morob”: “Ortiala’s” Papuan delinquent
who, when asked in court what he had to say, sug-
gested that he should be made a policeman (11.
10/4/’24) isn’t such a curiosity as might be
thought. In the Mandated Territory some 3'ears ago
the native police were frequently recruited from
the local gaols, and I know of two murderers who
were released from serving one a seven- and the
other a ten-year sentence in order that
they might join the police. Usually
such recruits made good John Hops,
and both those mentioned became ser-
geants within a year or two. It has
to be remembered that to a Papuan
being in quod is not such a disgrace
as is the case among civilised people,
and that often a native is given a
stretch for doing something which,
though forbidden by the white man,
has been a nigger custom since time
immemorial. It 'Was;-William Mac-
gregor who first struck the idea of
picking out. the hardest doer in a
village and entrusting him with the
job of preserving law and order
here; and as usual the old Scot wasn’t
far wrong.
I a Ariki : Are queer accidents still on
tap? A resident of Wanganui (M.L.) sent his dog
across the paddock to bring in a cow for milking
While shaking her head at the dog, the animal
struck her top-piece against a tree and fell dead.
On investigation the owner found that she had broken
her neck.
H.G. : Snakes are rare in the Fiji
Islands, so the imported mongoose is deprived of
much sport. On one occasion, however, the alien
was able to exhibit the subtlety of its methods. A
small tree-snake was reclining upon the end of a
blanch, well out of reach, when a mongoose spied it.
The latter disappeared for an interval, then re-
turned and, climbing the tree, made its way along
the bough until its weight caused the necessary oscil-
lation. With a plop the snake was precipitated
to earth, and at the instant it landed a second
mongoose obviously by arrangement—sprang from
the jungle and pounced on it. Mongoose No. 1, with
apparent pride in a job well done, descended to
enjoy its share of the prize.
“Hopalong”: Now that the Council has
wet all its cats, what about dogs that can’t swim ?
A friend of mine, thinking he would give his wife's
poodle a lesson or two, dropped the “little dear’’
overboard from a dinghy. It promptly sank in 10ft.
of water. Fearing the wrath to come, my friend
dived in, clothes and all, and rescued the useless
bit of fluff.
“Billo C.”: Near a main road within 40
miles of Adelaide stands a big gumtree with an old
oval wound on its stem, which the well-informed
point out to the
novices as a record of
the ancient abo.’s skill
in the canoe-making
craft. Yet this was
the work, 48 years ago,
of my brother aged 14
and myself, a full 11.
Without any by-your-
leave we invaded a
neighbor’s paddock,
and with no better
tools than tomahawks
hacked out and prised
oil a quite serviceable
canoe from a slight
bow in the butt of a
redgum. We knew
nothing of the fine
arts, related by Abo.
correspondents, o f
wedging up, drying-on-
the-tree, caulking' and
so on; but—by luck,
1 suppose—-levered it
off green and whole
(no easy part of the
job, by the way),
carried it half a mile
to the creek, dried it
after a fashion and
launched it. A perilous
craft enough, but it
would hold one boy, or
two if they held their
breath and balanced to
a hair. We made pre-
carious voyages in it
until the novelty wore
off; but we overlooked
the necessity of keeping- such a boat under water
when not m use, and the next summer’s sun
cracked it up.
* *. * #
“Liss”: Tell “Darby” (B. 27/3/’24) that
there is a bore on a western N.S.W. run where I
as oierseer not long ago which increases its
delivery when the moon is full. The bore is on
top of a stony mulga hill and the water flows
down two drains, one each side of the hill The
difference in volume can be plainly seen in each
drain. This is the only case of the kind I have
come across.
‘Te Pana”: The luscious green turtle
haunts the reefs of the Friendly Islands. The court-
ing season is the time to catch ’em, and the natives
wait patiently for the lovemaking to commence.
\\hen the greenback is seen, an islander leaps into
the sea with an iron hook attached to a rope, and
grapples the turtle between the front flipper and
the neck. Another native hauls on the rope and
lands the catch. Then the village rejoices.
H.V.E. ’: That chaste, snow-white fowl
known as the spoonbill has appeared recently about
N.S.W. South Coast waterholes and lagocni, quite
near the towns, dining on slugs, small frog.s and
snails. The bird is
apparently not gre-
garious in habit, and
usually appears singly
or at most in odd
couples. It is much
rarer on the Monaro
highlands above, but
odd ones are seen occa-
sionally about the
lakes. They are there
known as white cranes,
and often in the bad
old days were shot out
of sheer wantonness.
Now, thanks be, the
useful birds are pro-
tected by legislative
enactment. These
spoonbills have yellow
beaks, but in another
and somewhat rarer
vari e t y, sometimes
called the royal spoon-
bill, the bills are black.
None of the family
appears to nest in
civilised localities, pre-
ferring remote and
desolate swamos. The
peculiar spatula, or
spoon-shape, of the bill, of course, accounts for
the name.
bette? 1 !™ u, ar ’ V Sydney rose gardeners had
ettei lav in a stock of air-guns and ammunition.
This morning I noticed near the hou,se a large bird
that could be none other than an English haw-
nneh ; later I saw two or three together. Some
weeks ago I had one of these birds in our back-yard
aviary, and when he escaped one -day I did not
trouble over him becoming a pest, as by himself he
could do no harm. When I saw the birds in numbers
this morning I began to think things. In England
the staple food of these finches— who can be told
immediately by their huge broad beaks—are the
haws on the rose bushes. They do a lot of harm
to the plants, and I hate to think what Sydney sub-
urban rose-growers will say when they wake to And
their best blooms lying all over the garden. The
hawfinch has brown wings set off with white figures •
his breast is dirty white and his head brown. His
main feature is his beak, which is like an over-
grown sparrow’s bill, huge and yellow, with the
edges and mouth marked with blue. He is about
as big as a starling, but not so noisy. His call
is a musical whistle something like that of a reed-
warbler, and is a really fine piece of music. Ho*’
he got here is doubtful.
“V 7 eronal”: Maoriland is credited by
some of the early voyagers with a wild dog, black
and white in color, which the old-time Maoris some-
times killed and ate. But it was probably an intro-
duced animal, as scientists hold that the only
indigenous quadruped is a species of rat. The
Maori name for this dog was “pero,” which bears
such a family resemblance to the Spanish “perro” as
to suggest that the animal may have been introduced
b. v a Spanish navigator. Captain Cook, as is well known,
left some hogs in Maoriland, from which a stock of
wild pigs was produced. The Maoris called these
pigs porka,” evidently from hearing the sailors refer
to the cloven-foots as “porkers." In just such a
way might “pero" be a corruption of the Spanish
word.
“Colub”; Among the diseases to which
snakes are subject is a curious on e whose outward
manifestation is a frosty-white substance around the
mouth and a bloated neck. Some years ago nearlv
every snake killed in N. Queensland was suffering
from this disease. On rare occasions the malady
has been known among snakes in captivity, one of
the names by which it is called by animal-dealers
being “woolly-mouth.” Whether it is due to a speci-
fic organism is not clear—-there does not appear to
have been any research done in connection with it.
A man who had lived in the Gulf country for many
years told me that at one period dead snakes were
frequently to be seen in the bush, and that almost
every one had the characteristic white fringe around
its mouth. This suggests that the disease is epidemic.
“H.V.E.”: There is an ancient record of
a brown snake with red belly, said to have been
seen mostly on French Island, in Westernport Bav
(Vic.), which the abos. described as being exceed-
ingly venomous—so much so that, when a binghi
was bitten by the reptile, he, as they said, “no more
walk about, only lie down and die.” One speci-
men seen taped about sft. The snake-books are
silent as to this brow’n snake, but mention several
freak varieties, one having an orange belly, a part
which, in the common species, is a dirty white.
Many of the rarer Australian snakes are known and
described (if any description at all is given) from
single examples only, and little is known of their
life-history or habitat, the ways of serpents being
secretive.
"Nitric”: Some men can take care of a
horse, others have difficulty in differentiating be-
tween a prad and a rattlesnake. A cobber of mine
in the Light Horse (Q.) had a mount which served
him faithfully in Palestine through the campaigns
of IQI6-17 w’ithout even a day’s sickness. My cobber
died at Damascus in 1918 and another cove took
over the neddy. AVithin a fortnight the poor brute
was done and had to be shot. It w T as a case of
ill-treatment rather than heart-break, though I’ve
seen horses pine away when their masters took the
count.
THE STALWART.
“Take a hand at euchre, Bolsh?”
"No, brothers. I refuse to -play with kings and' queens.”
“Gouger” : A while back the Council was
arguing as to the best way to rid your hut of fleas.
\V e know one way of doing it thoroughly. First
time a horseman comes along with a nice clean dog
(his tail must be mast high, ears pricked, eyes
speculative-like, and coat covered with an air of confi-
dence if his tail droops he’s flea-stricken), call the
cove over, admire his horse, then invite him inside
for a drink of tea. Call his dog in, too, and make
much of the tyke. Give him a bit of stale meat
and a lot of kid, and encourage him to stay in
the hut. But don’t let the owner take a tumble
unless there’s a hospital handy, because this flea-
confidence trick is about played out in the bush.
FRIENDS.
[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
When the reign of the Summer is ended
And a shrewdness appears in the breeze,
\\ hen Winter is throwing her splendid
t\ hite mantle o’er mountains and trees,
Though the thoughts of dull days bring a measure
Of saddening regret in their train,
The sadness is fraught with the pleasure
Of meeting a fire once again.
Right gladly I sit down beside it,
When the day and its duties are done;
Right gladly with food I provide it
At fabulous prices the ton;
Bend o’er it, an amateur stoker,
Whose zeal for his task never ends,
And fetch it a crack with the poker
To show we are genuine friends.
VICTORIA.

The Society for the Prevention of Cruelty
to Governors looked over the vice-regal time-
sheet last week, and called a stop-work
meeting. At any rate, there’s been some
sort of brake on the social round for the past
seven days. Even marrying anti giving in
marriage has apparently begun to pall. Only
the departure of the Boy Scoixts and the
G.P.S. l’owing championships put a dash of
color into the week. One morning a hun-
dred palpitating Scouts from Queensland and
N. S. Wales swirled through the city w'ith
dnxm-beat and flying pennants. Followed
mothers, sistei’s and brothers in fluttering
hordes. The lusty infants finally were
stow'ed into the Largs Bay, and in a flash
the. w'harf became a jungle of paper stream-
ers, gi’een and blxxe and red, yellow and
purple, like some exotic growth. Vice-
l-oyalty had said good-bye to the youngsters
the night befoi’e at the Town Hall, and the
Arncliffe Scouts, with band and bugles, were
responsible for keeping time for the fare-
well march.
Incidentally, don’t you wish you had in-
vented the colored-paper streamer? A little
Darlinghurst foresight like that is what
makes the Darling Pointer of to-morrow.
No Australian snapshot that you can show-
in England is looked at more curiously.
They don’t know' anything of such things
there.
That great annual benefit for the Ferry
Co. and the launch-proprietor and the ven-
dor of ribbons, the G.P.S. Head of the River
regatta, happened on Saturday; and every
G.P.S. boy w'itli several flappers apiece got
there somehow. And there was the usual
upi’oar, w'hich must have made the old Aus-
tralia cock up one ear and turn her mind
back a few years. No one saw' much of the
race—in fact, xxo one could see much more
than the crowded ferry or launch tied up
in front of his particular craft; if thex’e
wasn’t one tied up there one moment there
was the next. Gov.-General Forster was
busy elsewhere opening a Boy Scouts’ hall,
so missed seeing Grammar win the eights
for the third year in succession and Sydney
High ixxake its debut in the regatta by win-
ning the first fours. Everyone was liappy,,
except one lass who fell out of a launch,
and the crews themselves, who provided an
excellent reason why the course for the
eights is too long for schoolboys. It looks
like leaving a lot of damaged hearts iix after-
years.
The National Council of Women held its
Peace Conference on Monday and Tuesday
of this week, the Governoi’-Generars consort
being in the forefront the first day, and
Lady De Chair the second. Dr. Elsie Dal-
yell, Mrs. Muscio and Mrs. Jamieson Wil-
liams w'ere among those who contributed
lectures on several ways to avoid war; and
others who spoke true w'ords were presi-
dent Mi’s. MacCallum, knight Henry Brad-
don and psychology-expert Lovell. A lunch
at Farmer’s refreshed speakers and listeners
on each day; and the gentle lamb w'as
butchered that the talkers on the prevention
of bloodshed might reach more spiritual
heights.
“Great Scott, it sounds like the Somme!”
the young man exclaimed as he dropped off
the tram at King-street on Friday morning.
But it w'as only the rattle of the machine-
guns that were holding up the l’ush to the
city and relieving it of £15,000 to keep the
w'olf from the door of the hospitals. It took
over 6000 women and children and a small
army of entertainers and mere males to
glean this silver harvest, woi’king non-union
hours —8 a.m. till after 10 p.m. Just on 10.30,
ixx the market-place opposite the Customs
House, one enthusiastic goddess on the wdieel,
her feet set amid a glitter of aluminium pots,
was auctioning an Indian rupee. This new
bazaar was one of the most picturesque of
the collecting strongholds, with its flagged
floor, its twinkling lights and the sombre
bulk of the Customs looming above the awn-
inged stalls. Martin-place, of coui’se, was
the Mecca to which all traffickers finally
di’ifted. Here a stall piled with the silks,
the fans and the preserves of China did a
roaring trade. And everywhere chocolate-
wheels lured the gambler in sweetmeats to
his destruction. In short, Chai’ity had spread
her net, and the feet of a city w’ere entangled
therein.
With misguided enthusiasm the Femin-
ists have been making the welkin ring over
the affair of Polini and her child; and even
w'hile they were knocking at the Ministerial
door Emelie was on her way to Europe.
Surely if she had been so agonised over the
separation from her baby she’d have stayed
on to fight for possession of her off-
spring. The new' job the Feminists
are tackling is a much more worthy
one. Its main object is the establishment of
a Chair of Midw'ifery at the University, and
the extension of both students’ and nurses’
training in obstetrics. And while they are
about it they might do the greatest possible
service to their sisters in the country—the
real country—by getting the Government to
make it obligatory on State-aided hospitals
to u'eleome the little Australian.
Details of Girlie (Gertrude Pati'icia)
Toohey’s w'edding in S’Africa readied Sydney
last week. Father Reily tied the knot in
the R.C. Church at Cumnor, where Girlie’s
pink-and-wliitehess emerged from a troth of
silver lace that glow'ed like a rosy shell from
the pink tulle foundations. A veil of Car-
rickmacross lace, orauge buds and orchids
completed the outfit, w'hose sartorial splen-
dor was reinforced by the ivoi’y tulle and
satin frocking worn by the ’gi'oom’s two sis-
ters, Margaret and Denise Pargiter, w'ho
’maided. There wrns a great gathering of
Cape Town notables for the cake-cutting,
which took place in the Pai'giter home,
Kenihvorth, a few miles from Cape Town,
where bride’s mother and aunt (Mrs. Wes-
ton) did the honors. Justin, the ’groom,
besides being one of the rich Union Castle
shipping family, is related on mother’s side
to w'liole pages of the peerage. Among the
w'edding presents w'as a dessert service from
the Earl of Mar and Kellie, w'ho is the
young man’s uncle.
Good-looking Vera Bogle, of Mossgiel,
murmured the usual promises that made
her Mrs. William Spoonei’, of Manly,
midway through last week. The bridegroom
is a w'ell-known member of the staff of
Tooth’s, and the bride was given away by
genei’al-manager Cleary, of the big brew'ery
co.—he’s an amazing young man who lec-
tures at the Uni., and keeps up an easy
acquaintance with vai-ious languages, be-
sides running the vast concern. The wed-
ding w'as of the quiet and intimate order,
at which the bride’s sister ’maided and
Gordon Bell best-manixed.
Inez Eckford, of Cremorne, became Mrs.
R. de Wolf Heai’d at St. Philip’s the other
night, with all the trappings Convention de-
mands. The toasts were drunk at the Went-
w’orth.
Major Edgar Booth, president of the Uni.
Union and second in command of the Uni.
Scouts, conferred the whole box of tricks
plus his heart and name on Kitty Wilcox at
St. Mark’s, Darling Point. Kitty, who is the
only bud of the Murray Wilcoxes, of Darling
Point, rose to the occasion in the glory of
vellum chiffon velvet that drew' a heavily-
beaded train of the same material. The im-
memorial veil and orange-buds completed a
fascinating picture. Two bridesmaids, sug-
gesting Arcady in pale pink organdi looped
with mauve ribands, w'ere balanced by best-
man Lt.-Commander Sinclair, R.N., in his
naval outfit, and groomsman Dr. Rex Money,
in the well-i-emembered khaki. Bride’s
parents afterwards did the honors in their
ow'n home, Mrs. Murray Wilcox hostessing
in mole georgette embossed with gold.
This is Dorothy Mischell, the fascinating
girl w'ho has won the first Dalcroze scholar-
ship in eui’liythmics open to all Australia.
Doi’othy is a State-school teacher, and hails
fro m Ne’w-
cas t.le. Her
musical know-
ledge, wffiich is
extensive, was
gained from
pianist Find-
ley Evans; and
Mary Wlxid-
born e, the
first Dalcroze
teacher in this
State, has
trained her in
the art of the
E u r h y thrni-
ticians. The
scholar-
ship holds for
three years,
and a condi-
tion is that
its beneficiary
shall come
back to Aus-
tralia and teach the Dalcroze method for an-
other three years. The first effort of the
new'ly-formed Dalcroze Society will be to
raise £4OO for Dorothy’s upkeep in London
during her apprenticeship. May Moore took
the picture.
Journalist Fred Cahill was riveted in
matrimony the other day to Madeleine Man-
ning, the job being done by Monsignor King
and Father Halpin, who had both been over
the top with the ’groom in France. The
bride brings a very swagger canteen of cut-
lery to the union, the same having been
handed over to her by the Director-General
of Public Health (Dr. W. G. Armstrong),
with a mountain of good wishes from fellow-
workers in the Department.
Cloth of silver embroidered in pearls
swmthed on classic lines, with a break-
away in one of the new' side-trains, formed
Alix Mackay’s w'edding-gown, and a cascade
of tulle veil and orange-blossom completed
the outfit in which she exchanged the usual
vows with Dr. Cuthbert Verge, of Fiji, while
Padre John Ferguson blessed the union.
Joyce Ireland, of Toronto, has pledged
herself to Rex Chateau, of Warialda % Rex
is the eldest son of the late C. W. M.
Chateau and of Mrs. Chateau, of Darling-
Point.
Out of a w'eek of social gloom the St.
Vincent’s Old Girls’ dance at the Wentw'orth
shone radiantly. This yearly re-union of
the big Darlinghurst College girls is always
an intimate affair buzzing with reminiscences
and the renewal of selioolday friendships.
Chrysanthemums of autumn colorings
glowed on a hundred-odd tables, and the
evening sparkled along, a heady brew of
prettilv-frocked girls and quick-footed men.
Mrs. Hatfield, Mrs. J. J. Smith and Nellie
Casey were vice-presidents of the flutter,
w'hich had Faith Quinlan for treasurer and
May McLellan for secretary.
Judith Fletcher presents Dr. Clubbe to
you, and if you don’t know who he is ask
anyone who has been in the Royal Alex-
andra Hospital for Children any time in
the last 39
years. II e
has through
tli a t 1o n g
period served
the interests of
ailing child-
hood w r it h
splendid devo-
tion : some of
the lads and
lasses wffiose
limbs he has
straight-
ened a n d
whose health
he has built
up are now
stalwar t
fathers and
mothers in
whose ears his
name still
rings like
magic. Under
his care the hospital has grown to the second
largest in the world —only beaten in size
by the Paris institution. When the doctor
first joined the staff the cots numbered 55;
now they total 380, and the attendance of
small out-patients last year ran to .40,000.
Baby clinics, the District Nursing Associa-
tion, the Bush Nursing scheme —in short,
every plan for the : betterment of children
has Dr. Clubbe among its most notorious
instigators.
The enthusiasm at the yearly meeting of
the big Camperdown hospital spoke for itself.
The State Governor presided, and civic coun-
tenance was given by Mayor Gilpin. Secre-
tary Clarence Moss shyly disclosed that an
interested public had dropped £42,000 into
the treasury during the year; but it will
have to be £OO,OOO this year if the committee
is to do for sick children all it has planned.
The Mosman Amateurs carry off another
laurel wreath for their “Duchess of Dant-
zig.” “Full house” was the sign every night,
and Dorrie Ward, as the Duchess, and Eric
Howell, as Napoleon, deserved it. Christina
Ormiston, too, earned a special mention for
her Renee, and Spencer Barry for his eagle-
eyed "production,” while A. H. Norman had
his orchestra as responsive as genii to the
wave of his baton.
Clarence Raybould, the accompanist with
the Charles Hackett company, hails from
Birmingham, which tries to show' its neigh-
bor Manchester that it still leads the cold
half of England in culture. He was first a
student and later on the professorial staff of
the Midlands School of Music. From there
he went to London, fell in with Beecham,
and was engaged to conduct at Covent Gar-
den —his first job was on “Falstaff,” for
which he received such flattering notices that
he continued to conduct alternately with
Pitt till the financial collapse of the pill-
king’s enterprise. He conducted “The Beg-
gar’s Opera” at the Hammersmith Lyric,
and left that to conduct Boucicault’s pro-
duction of “Lilac Time” in the West End
Lyric. He spends his spare time compos-
ing and building up a reputation as a bril-
liant solo pianist.
At the Playbox Studio (Rowe-street) on
Sunday evening Duncan Macdougall will
deal with Robert Browning, measuring him
against the Pagan ideal.
The Dominican ex-students are preparing
for their yearly foregathering at the Went-
worth the w r eek after next; and ticket-
holders are w'arned to earmark their tables.
A popular worker in good causes, Mrs.
Roystone Davey, has rallied strong support
to the Woollahra banner of the District
Nursing Association. A fete in aid, at
Eynesbury—the Albert Goulds’ home —on
Saturday afternoon, is being skippered by
Mrs. Lang Campbell, backed by Mrs. Walter
Brunton, Mrs. Ken Austin, Miss Fairfax,
Mrs. Ellison Rich and others. The fair is
going to specialise in side-shows and enter-
tainments for kiddies under the trees of the
old garden, and be cheered to revelry by the
Metropolitan Band. Gates open at 2.30, and
the money goes tow r ards the new home for
the nurses.
Attorney-General Bavin's wife organised
a cheery frivol in the club-house at the
White City courts on Friday night. The
gate-money is for the building fund of the
new hostel for the deaf and dumb. Pink-
shaded lights made fair women look fairer
and the not-so-fair look passable; and the
decorations combined gaiety with thrift, and
consisted of many-hued streamers. The
Attorney-General came with his wife and
daughter Shirley, and the knightly Braddon
squired his lady and Yalerie, who ruffled in
blue taffetas and silver lace. Mrs. A. B.
Shand was treasurer, the roll-up was excel-
lent, and the company unimpeachable.
One of the most interesting art shows
ever held around Sydney should be George
Collingridge’s exhibition in the Masonic Hall.
Turramurra. The veteran artist, besides
steeping himself in early Australian history,
has adventured with brush and pencil in
France, Italy and Spain, and the story of
his early years and his drawing of the
sword against the armies of Garibaldi sounds
like a John Barr McCutclieon novel.
On an evening of last week passers-by in
Macquarie-street were edified by the sight
of struggling masses bombarding the Con-
servatorium —the musically-starved hot-foot
on the trail of the orchestral feast that con-
ductor Arundel Orchard was advertised to
spread within. But something having gone
wrong, somebody had ordered closed doors,
with the result that even vice-regals were
left outside to cool. But it’s a democratic
age; and when the barriers were down per-
sonages like Jack Cannot and Leo Cherniav-
sky were seen rummaging for their own
chairs. Fortunately the musical brew was
sufficiently potent to cheer every heart. The
second concert is announced for June 4.
That good trier, Florence Fourdrinier, has
founded the Everywoman’s League, whose
object is to fight “sickness, suffering and
crime” by getting the community to give
more attention to domestic economy. To
this end Miss Fourdrinier intends to hold
daily demonstrations and talks on food-values
and mothercraft. The headquarters of the
league are at Daking House, where the
founder gives her interesting lccturettes in
a model demonstrating kitchen. For one
shilling you can be a member of the league
for 12 months.
A Brisbane postscript:—
A feature of the Uni. students’ procession this year
was a youthful Chancellor in cap, gown and false
moustache, whose back bore the explanatory label
“Sir Matt.” For the rest the Commem. march was
on the usual lines, one of the biggest hits being
made by a hint to new Mayor Barry about a “Roads”
scholar. Brisbane turned out to laugh and cheer.
On the last day of April, Freda, daughter of the
Southport Pagans, gave her hand and heart to
Bertram Delpratt of the Tambourine House Delpratt
family. Jean Cran bridesmaided in ivory and a black
hat, Maurice Delpratt best-manned, and Brisbane
and the South will see the honeymoon.
Splendid weather was turned on for the opening
of the Queensland Golf Club. Mrs. Coe’s team beat
Mrs. Anderson’s, and then everybody drank a dish
of tea. Walshes, Perrys and Thompsons were among
the players.
In a setting of gerberas, Mrs. Sowden hostessed at
the Graeeville Croquet Club, and during the after-
noion T. M. Hall arose to unveil a picture of the lady,
who is also the club’s champion.
About 300 jazzed or looked on at a fancy-dress
ball at Coolangatta. Most of the crowd were Bris-
bane folk, the Mark Harrises, T. C. Beirnes, and Dr.
Gray being among them.
There was a good roll up at Tattersall’s races:
among the most notable dressers were Mrs Garrick,
in paisley with a black turban; and Mary Power,
a recent deb., in navy.
The rooms of the Women Relatives of Soldiers and
Sailors’ League were among the places visited by
Lady Forster when she was in Brisbane. Their
Exes, took their departure on the 26th. Commander
Mutton, Lachlan Wilson, Canon Garland and Colonel
Cameron saw them off at the Central Station.
All the kirks lunched their particular brand oi
soldier on. Anzac Day. Quite a thousand went to St.
John’s Anglican Cathedral, where a marquee was
filled with food and flowers. Officers and men from
the Di'agon were included. It was the same at St.
Stephen’s, where fighting-priest Father Barry presided.
Archbishop Duhig and Brisbane’s new Mayor were
also on view here; and Gus Hughes (who served on
Gallipoli with the artillery) contributed to the
oratory. Gum-leaf calendars and monkeys-on-sticks
made by maimed men were given to the Dragon men
as souvenirs of Brisbane. The Methodies and the
Kirk also did their bit in feasting the returned men,
and at the St. Andrew’s luncheon Jock Thompson of
the Diggers Co. sang lustily. The march past
brought out a good many sightseers. During the
day the G.-G. laid the foundation stone of the nev>
Anzac Club in Elizabetlx-street, and in the evening
he and she went to the Exhibition Concert Hall for
the Commem. affair.
Mrs. A. B. Stark took a concert party to Ardoyne
the other day to sing and play to the invalid Diggers,
and besides thanks from Billjim they got tea from
Matron Macdonald.

Chatter
The Occidental
Collins St. Melbourne.
Melbourne has gone grand opera mad.
Even the office-boy and -girl palpitatingly
declare they would rather pawn their boots
than miss a new production. The fashion
was started by the biggest advertising cam-
paign ever launched here; but, seduced by
grand opera’s own provocative charms, the
crowds now swarm thither for love of the
thing. On Friday night the management
was nearly driven to frenzy turning people
away from “Faust,” and the rush for “Sam-
son and Delilah” on Saturday night was
only a little less terrific. Dame Nellie made
a comely Juliet in the usual grey frock and
yellow plaits, and an avalanche of vegetation
descended on her after the second act. One
bit of floriculture didn’t, however —it landed
on the head of the first trombone, who sub-
sequently heaved it stagewards, and the diva
neatly fielded it with a joyous schoolboy
chortle.
If the Biblical Delilah was as seductive
as Phyllis Archibald, then one could almost
forgive Samson for being such a silly ass as
to share his strong-man secret with the siren.
Phyllis’s first garments of misty white were
captured at the hips with a beaten silver
scarf, and a cloud of white on her head was
hemmed in with pearls, while more pearls
rosetted the ears. An apple-green under-
dress gleamed faintly through the white
draperies. Her second enfoldment of green
was held in by a hip sash of a deeper shade,
and a gossamer length of biscuit color fell
from one shoulder. Finally she appeared in
white net, encrusted mid-front with pearls;
a jewelled butterfly spread its wings across
her chest, and a veil falling from the back of
her head shrouded her whole figure. Delilah
was accorded an imposing ovation after the
second act, and her fellow-artists sent along
a mammoth bouquet which blotted out half
the stage.
McNamara, V.C., came into the limelight
again last week, when he climbed back into his
war trappings to claim his Belgian bride,
Helene Bluntschli. Her mother had brought
her across-seas to hand her safely over, and
her brother-in-law, John Roth, came over
from Sydney to give her away. Ostrich
feather-tips fluttered on the bride’s snowy
draperies, and orange blossoms coroneted
her tulle veil. Sister Gertrude McNamara,
in primrose taffetas and black velvet hat,
tended her, while Flight-Lieut. Howell’s tiny
daughter Elaine, looking like a little pink
fairy, kept the bridal train out of the dust.
Airmen Frank Lukas and Murray Jones
combined to look after the V.C., and a con-
tingent of birdmen supplied the usual arch
of steel in the church porch. Madame Blunt-
schli held an after-reception at Ardoch Man-
sions, St. Kilda, where she welcomed her
guests in the usual all-black fixings under a
decorative scheme of aeroplanes in flight and
corps-color streamers.
V. H. Casey, an insolvent who applied to
Judge Moule in Melbourne the other day for a
certificate of discharge from his debts, is the
hero of an interesting romance. Ten years
ago he deeply disappointed a tailoress named
Gourlay, and the Court awarded her £470
for breach of promise. She is still waiting
for the money, and has made another claim
for £286, an amount which is alleged to
cover sundry loans, the cost of clothes made
for him and his brother, and various sums
spent on shouting him dinners, theatres, etc.
One little item in her claim is for a refund
of the hire of chairs in the Fitzroy Gardens,
where they presumably held hands, whilst
one dreamt of a future that hasn’t come to
pass. The lady is now opposing his appeal
for a clean bill of financial health on the
grounds that “he has been earning consider-
able sums of money under his brother's
name, and has been spending money and liv-
ing at expensive hotels.” He will get a
chance to answer these allegations before
Judge Moule on the 28th.
John Sanderson, who is re-packing for
London after several months here, chin-
chinned a big group of pals over the after-
noon teacups at Menzies’. Mrs. Archie San-
derson, lately from the West, shouldered the
job of hostess for her brother-in-law. Dame
Nellie, with son George’s wife, rushed in for
a few minutes, bewailed the fact that she
couldn’t stay, and then rushed off again.
Among John Sanderson’s male supporters in
a sea of petticoats were Ernest Watt, from
Sydney; Ted Fitzgerald and S’Henry Parker,
also big Bob Simpson, lately back from an
oversea trip with his family. Another Syd-
ney visitor was violinist Du Boulay’s musi-
cal wife, who has dropped in here to see her
daughter, Mrs. Abercrombie.
Collindena station, Riverina, where for
half a century the Hays have been making
it while the sun shone, was sold last week
to Mr. Carroll, a Melbourne building-con-
tractor, for £130,000. This nice, fat cheque
did not buy the Hays’ stud stock with the
rest of the belongings. It has ever been the
new owner’s ambition to mix squatting with
contracting, it seems. His wife artlessly
gave to a newspaper reporter the evidence
of building being a fine game these high-
rent times. “My husband is a self-made
man,” she said. “We started 18 years ago
and worked very hard, and I helped my hus-
band with his business in every way I could.”
Heigho ! Lots of people must have worked
hard for 18 years without winning the where-
withal to buy 15,000 acres of station land.
And 10 of those 18 years have passed since
the beginning of the war which made so
many non-builders poorer in body and estate.
Vera Gee and Vernon White exchanged
their vows in the Melbourne Grammar
Chapel the other afternoon. The handsome
bride, all dewy white, silver and diamente,
with pink roses blushing on her arm, was
led to the sacrifice by her step-father, Thomas
Gill. The ’groom’s godfather, Archdeacon
Hindley, helped school-padre Arnold to
shackle the pair; Manus Larkings saw the
bridegroom through the ordeal, and Mabel
Longden ’maided in blue and silver under a
black velvet hat. The bride’s god-daughter,
Vera Johnson, and the bridegroom’s tiny
niece, Marjorie Brodribb, wore similar frock-
ings as assistant maids. Wedding tea was
dished at Menzies’.
This year’s Head of the River race having
been transferred to Geelong, the crowds
philosophically flooded the Yarra banks on
Saturday afternoon to howl themselves
hoarse at the Public Schools’ second and
third crews. Melbourne Grammar pulled off
the double, and no one was more thrilled over
the victory than the Tom Millears. One
son, Spencer, pulled an oar with the Seconds,
while a Fellows nephew helped to make up
the Thirds. The squatter, by the way, is
now carrying off his wife, daughters and
son Jim for a look round Uncle Sam’s land,
with possibly a peep at Eastern Asia to
follow. On Friday night the Australian
Club, of which he is president, gave him a
send-off dinner-party.
Melbourne showmen were not going to be
robbed of their annual Boat Race outbreak
merely because the college boys had to go to
Geelong to row. The Tiv. announces screen
pictures of the heats and the final. “The
Cabaret Girl,” at the Royal, promises a gala
and threatens vaguely that members of the
crews will be present (“In the Presence and
under the Worshipful Patronage of the
Crews,” it ought to read), while Hugh Ward,
at the- Princess’s, has secured an uproari-
ous reception for a special “Nellie Kelly”
night by selling the theatre to Old Scotch
and Old Wesley. For this occasion only
tickets may be bought from Arthur Robin-
son, at Collins House, or the Old Wes-
ley agency at Table Talk office. And all
on account of six lots of lads engaging in
an aquatic tournament! But then the cus-
tom of getting furiously noisy on Boat
Race Night is “so English,” and sanctified by
Oxford and Cambridge precedent.
Francie Young supplies this photo of
Ralph Warner, whose show of decorations
at Miss McLean’s secluded studio, 125 Col-
lins-street, has been praised by the critics.
He is a 22-year-old native of Geelong, and
cultivated his
taste for art
under A. E.
Anderson at
the Gordon
Technical Col-
-leg e, subse-
quently com-
ing to Mel-
bourne and
the life classes
of the Vic.
A r t i s t s’
Society.
Warner has
derived his
method from
Japanese
cloisonne
work, his aim
being merely
suggestions of
lovely land-
scape and
atmospheric
effects by the simplest treatment in body
color. Water-colorist Harold Herbert thinks
a lot of the youth, and showed his interest
by heading the line of buyers at the exhibi-
tion.
John Bowser, the new Speaker, is a very
good journalist, a more than passable talker,
and probably the best-read man in the State
Parliament, the erudite Tunnecliffe not ex-
cepted. Unfortunately he has the desiccated
look of the student, and big, cheerful men,
repelled by his reserve, don’t take the trouble
to discover the kind heart that beats within.
Though he is regarded as dry and humorless,
he is actually something of a wit. Probably
he has forgotten his first meeting with George
Reid, when the latter, discovering an eloquent
listener, expatiated on the beauty of hope,
and said he was the greatest optimist of a
singularly optimistic family. “I’m sure I
don’t wonder at it,” commented Bowser
mildly. “See what a lot you have to look
forward to.” Reid’s only answer was to
gaze fondly on his lower chest and smile
gaily.
Patricia San Miguel swore herself away to
her English fiance, Leslie Henwood, last
Thursday evening at Our Lady of Victories’
Church, Camberwell. Her white georgette
draperies over rosy underskirts were a regu-
lar Tom Tiddler’s ground of pearls and
crystal, while a veil of old Limerick flowed
from a Spanish head-dress of lilies-of-the-
valley and orange blossoms. The back sweep
of her gown was held by Consul Montero’s
youngest infant, whose fascinations were
curtained in a pocket edition of the bridal
togs. Sister Inez and Connie Lumsden sug-
gested twin roses in pink chiffon and satin
draperies, with white ostrich feathers on the
ledges of their pink picture-hats. The newly-
weds are off by the Diogenes for an English
honeymoon.
Geoff Anderson, portrayed here by Rem-
brandt, is another of the little army of young
Victorians who are trying to daub their
names on the
scroll of fame
with a paint-
brush ; and in
his case, at
least, he seems
to have some
warranty for
the effort in a
very consider-
able natural
ability. He
has been
splashing color
since his in-
fancy his
years total
only 22 now—
but until he
enrolled as a
Gallery st u-
de n t a few
months back
he had practi-
cally taught
himself all he knew. The other day when
he exhibited his work for the first time in
the little Queen’s Hall, the paintings in
general, and his watercolor ’scapes in par-
ticular, came in for much commendation
from the critics. Young Geoff is a grand-
son of the late pastoralist politician, Andrew
Anderson, of Tottington, St. Arnaud.
One of the pretty Duckett girls, who mar-
ried the Russian doctor Ivlatchko, is back
from Vladivostock with a saddening story of
disaster in her husband’s family. It seems
that all of his closest relatives, bar one
brother, were caught in the teeth of the re-
volution. A favorite sister was shot dead
in the streets of Petrograd, and disease and
starvation finished the others. The brilliant
Australian girl is here for a few months,
and then hastens back to her man in Shang-
hai, which has become quite a dump for
Russian refugees.
A fair-sized gathering of mixed social pre-
tensions accepted Lady Stradbroke’s call to
a tea-drinking to launch the District Nurs-
ing Association’s £15,000 appeal. The cups
rattled after Archbisli. Lees, Mayor Brun-
ton and A. T. Danks had assisted the Count-
ess to vocally boost one of the most deserving
charitable efforts in this city. As no one
seemed to have any valuable suggestions to
offer anent raising the oodle, little business
was done. However, her Ex. later sent a
letter to the morning dailies suggesting that
the public should’ for this time, at least, fol-
low the golden rule of direct giving, and
her call has already been replied to with two
100-guinea cheques, one from the ever-gener-
ous Tom Millear, the other from John Grice.
A sneak-thief furnished the sensation of
the evening at a charity bridge-party in a
St. Kilda-road flattage the other night.
Under cover of the hilarious Dutch-auction-
ing of a ham and chicken the vandal broke
into the larder and made away with the
goods that were being sold, as well as other
comestibles. His exploit came to light only
when someone trekked kitchenward to col-
lect the chook and the ham for delivery to
the man who had topped the bidding at
£.3 3s. The joke of the thing balanced the
wrath of the company over the theft, and as
the auction had been run on cash lines the
charity didn’t suffer.
The O'Brien Girl and her fellow-conspira-
tors had unpacked new outfits when they
came back to Nellie Kelly’s place at the
Princess’s. The house showed a top-dress-
ing of the Best Known, Priminister Bruce
with his wife and his wife’s sister (Mrs.
Alston) and the latter’s husband being boxed
on the right. Mamie Watson had two new
frocks of the billowy-skirted, straight-
jacketed kind she seems to have marked
down as her own. The first was of blue silk
with gold and silver waves and double scal-
loped edges over filmy petticoatings of bluc-
and-silver lace. But swaying hip wires rob
the draperies of their gracefulness. In the
second act she floats round like a green-and-
champagne-colored orchid, with two-decker
skirtings of apple-tinted georgette flowing
over a lacy under-dress. More lace falls over
the top edge of the green straight-
jacket, and brilliants glitter at the
hip-line. May Beattie gets home with
a wonderful set of new silken curtain-
ings in orange color toned down with side
sandwich-boards of ivory, and billowing
under- an ivory jacket turned back with
orange. Later she is a positive riot in lime-
colored cashmere de soie, heavily weighted
with gold lace; a soul-stirring wrap of the
lace shawls her shoulders and flows away
into panels at each side. Twin trains of
cloth of gold trickle from her waist along
the ground, where they are held at anchor
with a giant pincushion of gold and fur.
The Bard’s birthday was celebrated in the
Masonic Hall, where the dynamic Charlotte
Hemming presented a Sliakspearean menu,
with three scenes from “Macbeth” as the
principal dish. Charlotte herself was Mac-
beth’s unfortunate lady, and among other
stars of the evening were Lorna Forbes,
John Hopkins and Mostyn Wright. Singers
Edwin Hooke, Joe Foster and Jessie
McMichael assisted on the vocal side, while
Billy Burrell occupied the music-stool and
Charles Daly had something quite flattering to
say about the late lamented Bill and his
works.
The Clive Leonards gladdened the 10th
anniversary of their wedding the other even-
ing with a jazz party in their South Yarra
home, Airlie, the iron-balconied white house
which has successively sheltered the Tom
Halls, George Chirnsides and Robert Har-
pers. A big group of the Best Known hus-
bands and wives was reinforced by flappers
and their dance partners, among the young
things being Lady Helen Rous.
On Friday afternoon Mrs. James Angus
roped in the end of Menzies’ lounge for a
send-off to singer Muriel Benton, who is off
to England under convoy of Henry Russell
and his wife, with an eye on a grand-opera
career. Both the Anguses spoke a few fare-
well words, to which the little singing girl
modestly replied.
A new restaurant had a private unveiling
at No. 9 Collins-street the other day, when
the proprietor entertained a gathering of the
Very Best at a midday feed. James Cocker-
ton, the host, was imported 12 years ago as
butler to the George Chirnsides, and his
clever little French wife came as Mrs.
Chirnside’s lady’s maid. For some years
they have been running the ultra-smart South
Yarra hashery, Yarra House, and would be
doing it still but for the Norton Grimwade
pair having swooped down and acquired the
place for a home.
A few lines from Adelaide: —
A sale of disabled , soldiers’ work at the Lady
Galway Clnb House, Henley Beach, was opened by
LacK Bridges. Some of the things on sale were
really exquisite, and £l3O goes to the men as the
result of the afternoon’s business. Incidentally,
there was music, and tea overflowed from the bil-
liard and dining rooms on to the wide verandahs.
The Students’ Dance Club held its first
frolic of the season on Saturday, when over 100
footed it in the Elder Hall. Harold Davies and
his wife did the hosting, and the affair was run
by a committee of students, with a Harris damsel
and a Cotterill young man as joint secs. The boat
club had its night out at the Palais on the Thurs-
day—an affair mostly of the younger set. There’s
been a dance at Glenelg, too, where the H. P.
MacLachlans put up a marquee on the lawn for a
ballroom, closed in the verandahs for sitting out,
set aside a bridge-room for non-dancers, and did
everything else to make the affair go with a swing.
There was a tea-party at Government House the
other afternoon, with the Mayoress, the Barwell,
Kidman, Edmund Bowman, Charles Hargrave, Nut-
ter Thomas, Osborn and Fenner matrons among the
guests.
A gold-bedecked church was a fit setting for
a cream-clad bride at the Angas-Good wedding, to
which all society turned up as guests, and at
which the local populace so crowded in that the
inviteds were hard put to it to make their way
into the church. The bridal dress was a sheath of
ivory crepe with a flounce of lace and a square
train, maize-lined and silver embroidered, hanging
from the shoulders, and a crystal filet caught the
tulle veil across the back of the hair. The ’maids
were Esther Legoe and Lilias Hawker, in beige
marocain with black hats, while the ’groom, who
is the youngest of the Charles Angas sons, had lan
Hayward as his best man and Dick Legoe as
’groomsman. Mrs. Good’s black frock had a drape
of ivory lace and a black georgette cape hung
from her shoulders. The ’groom’s mother was in
black and ivory too—lace and georgette and a
plumed picture hat.
Langdon Bonython, of the ’Tiser, left last week
to call on London —and Cornwall, of course. Mitchell,
for so long Professor of Philosophy at Adelaide
’Varsity and still Vice-Chancellor, has returned from
his jaunt. Prof. Rennie, who was acting-Vice
in Mitchell’s absence, will be acting-chairman of the
School of Mines while Bonython is away.

Munson, the Sydney trainer, whose
charges have a knack of winning “first up,” has
had a . profitable season with Prince Bardolph’s
brother, Barosca. When the going is a bit heavy, as
it was at Randwick on Saturday, the gelded son ct
Bardolph—La Mosca takes a lot of; catching, and in
the race for the £lOOO City Tattersall’s Cup there
was always daylight between him and his pursuers,
The Cypher and Corncrake being nearest to him at
the finish. The Cypher was favorite at 2’s (Barosca
was at 6’s) and four other 2-to-l chances failed
during the afternoon. However, it wasn’t such a bitter
day for backers as when King of the Forest, Munson’s
other meal-ticket, got home (in the Cup it was) at
20’s, two others at the same price, two more at
12’s and one at 10’s —all at the same club’s 1923
meeting. "

“Machete”: Someone writes (B. 24/4/ 24)
that Australia is the only country in the world where
owners of racehorses reckon it fashionable to affect
pseudonyms. The practice was common enough in
England and still is. “Mr. Fairie,” mentioned by
the paragraphist, was not an Australian, but an
English jackeroo who was lucky enough to get in
on the original Broken Hill Prop, before he led in
his two Epsom Derby winners, Lemberg and Gay
Crusader. Two famous English instances of the
“registered” name were “Mr. Manton,” otherwise the
late Duchess of Montrose, and “Mr. Abington,” whose
Merryhampton won the Jubilee Derby in 1887.
Neither had reason to hide their blushes, for the
Duchess was the most terrible old termagant of her
day; and Abington Baird, sole heir of a millionaire
Scottish ironmaster, was as unsavory a specimen of
a gilded ruffian as the Turf or the Fancy has ever
boasted.
“K. J.R.”: That Adelaide dividend ot
£135 14s. (B. 24/4/’24) was puny compared with
the £453 10s. collected on Karamu when that noble
animal won a hurdle race at Avondale (M.L.)
on April 26. There was only £7 on Kara-
mu, and £1 10s. was risked by a Hindoo
hawker. Two days before the meeting Hooshta
Mahomet had called at the stable with fruit,
and was told as a special favor that Karamu was a
stone moral. It was reckoned an exquisite joke
among the muckers-out, as the animal had only been
a fortnight in from the paddock, and was really
expected to run nineteenth in a field of nineteen.
The joke was on Hooshta’s side when that grinning
alien took his winnings home in a taxi.

The luck of racing has been strongly illus-
trated in the case of the Bobadil gelding Socratea in
Adelaide. For the late Charles IrWin he could not
win a stake, though placed second or third in an
exasperating succession. Of big events. RasheecJ
bought him last : September, and since then he has
won four races, worth £1215.
“H.W.S.”: Mrs. A. M. Tucker, who rides
trotters in the Speck, has had better luck lately than
that Melbourne matron who was disqualified for sus-
picious practices. The Tasmanian lady got two
winners home at Devonport, and backed them both.
On Dilma, who paid £6 12s. for 10s., she had £lOO,
and the entire profit went on Stella Patch, who'
returned a 6 to 4 dividend. The. dashing dame
comes from Winnahah, on the east coast.

Poor little George Mendies, the cleverest
flyweight eve? seen; in an Australian ring, has heard
the gong sound for the last time. In the fifteenth
round of a punishing fight at Sydney Stadium, the
stronger afid heavier Harry Gordon landed solidly
with a left body punch. As “Dixie’s” legs came
together the Victorian put everything he had into a
right which got home on the chin. Mendies fell
heavily, the back of his head meeting the canvas
with a thud that could be heard-in every part of
the huge- bliilding. The referee started the count, but,
seeing - t hat George was insensible, had him carried
to his corrieT and thence to his dressing-room. From
there he was taken to St. Vincent’s Hospital, where
he died on the third morning after the fight, having
never regained consciousness. He had beaten Gordon
in five rounds 14 months before, and was slightly
ahead on points until the last and fatal round.
“S.P.C.P.”: In a trifle more than six months three
Australian boxers have been borne dying from
Stadium rings—Jack Dunstan at Melbourne, Frank
Soady at Brisbane, and now George Menzies at Sydney.
The Melbourne butchery culminated in the eighteenth
round, the second in the seventeenth and the third
in the laist minute of th>e fifteenth. Do the languid
authorities require any more evidence that 20-round
contests —which have been legally abolished in the
U.S.A. and banned by;public opinion in Britain, the
home of Queensberry Rules—are dangerous? Must
other poor devils be bashed into their coffins or
into the lunatic asylum*, (the fate of at least three
pugilists who have foifght in ‘ Australia' in recent
vears) before bo'tits are restricted to 10 rounds, or
12 at the outside? Hfid a 10- or 12-round limit
been imposed after the Dunstan and Soady tragedies,
which occurred within a . week of one another, Mendies
would, in all probability, be alive to-day. In .each
case the damage was done when the boxer was so
exhausted, as a result of fighting for three-quarters
of an hour or thereabouts, that he couldn’t get
away from a punch. To a man in that condition,
which seldom arrives in 10-round bouts, the knock-
out blow (generally quite innocuous in other circum-
stances) is deadly, especially if he falls head first, as
Mendies ; did. It has been said that Wren, the
Stadium boss, , has promised to ' look ' after Mrs.
Mendies and her child. Very good of - him, ■no
doubt, but the relatives of dead boxers shouldn’t
have to defend on the caprices of the promoting
gentry; in such cases Employers’ Liability or Work-
men’s Compensation should protect them. It would
be interesting, by the way, to know what, if any-
thing, was done for the dependants of Dunstan and
Soady. ■ —

Tex Rickard has announced the match-
ing of Dempsey and Wills for a championship bout,
next September. Even if the long-delayed event is
brought off there will be doubts as to its genuineness
unless Wills wins. There is little, if any, money for
a. black champion nowadays: the more obviously
formidable he is the more religiously possible oppo-
nents who can claim to be white draw the color line.
It would pay Dempsey’s supporters to subsidise Wills
to lie down, and it would certainly pay him to
accept the offer if it was a generous one. The people
behind Burns approached Johnson with this end in
view (Burns knew from the beginning that he had
no hope) and Johnson agreed. -But Johnson merely
wished to make sure of getting His man into the ring.
His colossal vanity would have debarred him from
losing voluntarily even if there had been a fortune
in it. Wills, who has been working on wharves for
a living of late, may he more anxious for money
and more indifferent to glory than the obliterator of
Burns.

With a vigorous sprint over the last stretch
of the lj-mile Parramatta course, Sydney
Grammar School won the head-of-the-river title
for the third successive year. As in 1923,
they were beaten in their heat, but in the
final they carried too many guns for the lighter
“Shore” (Church of England Grammar) eight, and
had a little more in hand than the three-quarters of
a length that separated them. St. Joseph’s went well
for a mile, but finished three lengths behind “Shore.”
They had won their heat in 9min. 33sec.—10 3-ssec.
faster than Grammar’s time for the final —but the
effort palpably told cn them, which was also “Shore’s”
experience last year. Grammar, who were stroked by
R. C. Caswell (he pulled the same oar in the 1923
boat), were a particularly powerful lot of young fel-
lows. In the aggregate they weighed sst. 111 b. more
than the Queensland crew that carried off the inter-
state race at Adelaide. Sydney High School, making
a spectacular entry into these contests, won the First
Fours brilliantly "from St. Joseph’s and Scot’s, and
“Shore” took the Second Fours, St. Joseph’s being
second again.
“Harabone” : According to all accounts,
the inter-State eight-oar race was wretchedly handled
by the Port River (S.A.) authorities, but their
arrangements couldn’t have been worse than the
“facilities” for anchoring boats at the finish of Sydney
G.P.S. regattas. Every year it is the same; all
sorts of craft anchor in column of lump on either
side of the finishing point for 100 yards or there-
abouts. The ferryboats draw for positions, but the
last to leave town finds its allotted position poached
on by launches, public and private, and other vessels.
The result is that half the people who pay for a
view of the races from the ferryboats see nothing
except masses of shouting and frequently ill-mannered
school kids. But why the heterogeneous mass of
boats at the finish? Personally, I’d rather see an
interesting mid-portion of a row than see nothing
of the finish. The people who manage these big
regattas should insist on spectators’ craft being dis-
tributed along the whole length of the course.
“McNiblick’’: Melbourne golfers expect
A. W. Jackson to make a name for himself. Possess-
ing a long drive, though inclined to fuddle his
putting in close competitions, the youngster gave
the brilliant Ivo Whitton one of the runs of his life
WALTER
MILLER, the U.S.
wrestler. He has
beaten Meeske,
and is to meet
Weber.
the other day. Whitton
eventually got home
three strokes ahead,
but the youth made
him play for every
hole, and actually led
by three on the morn-
ing round. A streak
of bad luck, however,
spoilt one of Jack-
son’s best drives. He
struck a lark on the
wing, and the dead
bird and ball fell al-
most together in the
rough—surely one of
the oddest mishaps in
the history of the
game.
“H S ” • If Tiklen stands to Ms guns in
his row with the U.S. tennis authorities, he will make
things awkward for promoters all over the wouct.
Anv step tending to clarify a position which has
always been kept as vague-and undefined as possible,
lest the rickety empire of amateur status should
collapse altogether, must have this effect. \ ictoi
Trumper, for example, kept a shop in which he sold
cricketing material —chiefly bats named after himself.
He exploited his genius as a player to advertise
his wares, just as Tilden does, but was accepted ail
over the w'orld as an amateur. Needless to say he
was not, in the sense that an F. S. Jackson, a Lord
Dalnieny or a Lionel Tennyson can afford to interpret
the title. But how many are. nowadays? It there
is one : competitive sport more-; exclusive than an-
other, one pastime which, till recently, it would
have been heresy to suggest might be professionalised,
it is polo. Yet of late, rich enthusiasts such as
the Duke of Westminister have been financing mter-
mtional and other teams, and leading players have
been using their fame to make money on the side as
horse-copers and pony-dealers. Even more idiotic
than the convention which allows a gladiator to be
carted free all over the world without injury to his
honor, but makes a social outcast of him it Jie
journalises about his experiences, is the rule forbidding
participation in certain specified sports The finest
all-round athlete in Australia, an ex-officer m the
A I F and a tvpical amateur in the true sense, was
recently labelled a professional for having boxed
with pros., and Oxford’s best Rugby footballer (aiso
ail Australian) was threatened with the same fate
because he had once played the League game! in
short if Tilden is definitely established as a pro.
practically all outside the millionaire class are pros,
too—and," as Gilbert noted, “when everyone is some-
body. then no one’s anybody. ... .
* * * *
“15-30”- Tilden promises the Australians
a memorable tussle, and probably a defeat, when (or
if) they meet the Japs in the third round oi the
Davis Cup series. Last year the American champion
was similarly pessimistic, but the Aussies gave the
Nipponese a notable hiding, Anderson knocking out
Shimidzu in three straight sets, whilst Hawkes and
he defeated Fukuda and registered a wm in the
doubles. Personally, I can’t see Patterson and Wood
being beaten by any possible Japanese combination
in the doubles, and, however much 1 ukuda has
progressed since last year, I don’t fancy nis chance
of licking Patterson, who in good form is capable
of extending Tilden himself. Fukuda may beat Wood
but I doubt it; indeed. Wood’s deadly volleying and
network should make even Shimidzu go for his life.
Tilden has always been filled with an extraordinary
admiration for Shimidzu, possibly because the latter
nearly blew him out in a remarkable match two or
three" vears ago. But on that occasion Tilden was
playing Shimidzu’s game of steadfast defence from
the baseline, instead of working for the openings
which would enable him to bring his volley mtouise
at the net. As soon as he changed his tactics,
Shimidzu was done for. Patterson is never afiaid
to come to the net against a man with a slow
drive like Shimidzu, and Gerald s fast first bal ,
followed, if faulted, by a top-spinning backhander
more than head high for a man of small stature,
will, one fancies, sorely trouble little “Shimmy.
* * * *
“Tkairty-fawty”: Gerald Patterson is a
player of moods, but if he reproduces in America
the form he showed in Geelong recently, Ins opponents
will find him the sultriest of propositions. Geelong
beheld the tall fellow at his top. Nothing could stop
his express rush to the singles final, in which Hawkes
failed to produce a purple patch. The local cham-
pion sagged ‘under the onslaught, though it can be
said in excuse that he has played no first-class tennis
since his return from America last year. He has
assumed new responsibilities as one ot the heirs to
a vast estate. Wertbeim played pretty well, but his
technique was occasionally too dowdy to be effective,
whilst Miss Boyd was nowhere like the girl 01 lz
months ago. She has had a depressing season.
Norman Brookes failed to go far in the
hard-courts tournament at Torquay (Eng.). He was
finished in the second round of the singles by
Leighton Crawford, who scored a three-sets-to-one
victory The fact that Brookes was 5 and 4 games
down in the second and fourth sessions suggests that
he was decidedly off color, or was beaten by the
pace of the court. Partnered by Colonel Dudley he
reached the third round of the doubles, when he
was set upon by Crawford and Cameron, who got
home in three sets, though two of them were carried
to 10—8 and 9—7. Brookes will probably enter
for other provincial contests to tune himself up for
Wimbledon, where, by the way, it seems unlikely that
Tilden will join him in the doubles. It is also
improbable that Miss Lenglen will be available for
the mixed, so the veteran will either have to retire

The Olympic team, now on its way to
France, has been joined at the eleventh hour by
J. M. Bayley and Jim Willard. It will cost £7OO
to take the pair to Paris and back, but £5OO was
made available from the money raised for oarsmen,
swimmers, track athletes and the like, and the lawn-
tennis authorities, who have got barrels of easy lucre
out of the Davis Cup business, allowed the hat to
be sent round for the balance. A poor offertory
resulted, the public taking the view that some of
the Davis Cup profits should be disgorged, and if
a couple of enthusiasts hadn’t come to light with
a guarantee, Bayley and his partner would have had
to stay behind. In the raising of the Olympic fund
a fine spirit has been shown by supporters of rowing
and other pastimes, which are not gate-money pro-
positions, but certain lawn-tennis gentry have cut
a miserable figure.

The Sydney football season began in
showery weather, and the crowds were mostly at
Randwick and the boatrace. However, 18,000 bar-
raekers are estimated (generously) to have seen the
considerably strengthened South Sydney score 18 to 5
against Western Suburbs. The best man on the
ground was the veteran Harold Horder, who got 10
of the winners’ points (2 tries and 2 goals), but
Blinkhorn’s exhibition was rather disappointing.
Eastern Suburbs, for whom Oxford scored four goals
and a try, downed Newtown by 14 to 13; North
Sydney were playthings for Glebe (12 to 5), and
’Varsity and St. George finished a strenuous lj
hour with the board showing 13 all.
“Lexite’s Deputy’*: Uni. played Darragh as hooker
in place of Evatt. A grave situation has thereby
been created, for members of the Evatt family have
an uncommonly good Press. Indeed, one Evatt-
boosting organ “authoritatively” denied the nefarious
report that “the State’s Best Hooker” would not be
included in the team against St. George, adding that
“close inquiries are being made by officials of the
club to ascertain who is responsible for misrepresent-
ing the position, and drastic action may be taken.”
A selection committee impervious to such arguments
deserves only to be hit on the head with a bound
volume of puff-pars, about the Evatts.
Over 30,000 persons betook themselves to
South Melbourne to watch the local team play Fitzroy.
Mindful of their narrow squeak a week before, tile
Maroons gave no chances away; by superior marking
and better system they got ahead of South and
stayed there—B6 to 57. Carlton, finishing as stoutly
as against Fitzroy, managed to make a draw with
Essendon—7 goals 14 behinds all; and Collingwood,
getting into their stride in the last quarter, ran
away from St. Kilda—77 to 57. In a rough game at
the Pivot, Geelong downed Richmond by, 75 to 53.
Richmond had badly wanted to get Sharland; Gee-
long’s reply was that he would play with them or
nowhere. He played all right, but the fact seems
to have annoved the Tigers, for they made things
extremely willing. ■ j,
“Wink”; Fitzroy have obtained a fine forward in
Jack Moriarty. In his two games with them he has
bagged 14 goals and taken every opening With the
coolness and craft of a veteran. Heredity is on his
side, for his pa, Geoff Moriarty, was one of the
giants of the Australian game. Dad started with the
Britannias (who afterwards-became Collingwood). but
in 1892, with Fitzroy, was the-best centreman play-
ing. Then he had as team-mates such famous, warriors
as Worrall, Grace, deary, Melling and Banks. When
most men retire he took the nosition between the
posts, and for years shone at full-back, .as he had in
the centre. Then on the side were such footballers
as Trotter, Sharp, Brosnan, " Milne,’ Beauchamp, Fon-
taine and Bailes. Jack is clever and a sure kick,
but it will take a lot to convince old-timers that
he is as good as Geoff.
“0.K.” : Has the once-famous name of
Lillywhite disappeared from English cricket re-
ports? It was still an honored name of some im-
portance when I was a nipper, what time the three
Graces were in full flower of notoriety. The Lilly-
white of those days was a bowler of repute, but he
was not, of course, the original celebrity of the
family—James was his baptismal name, I fancy—
who invented round-arm bowling. James used to
do the “hat trick” when men played the game in
tall beaver bell-toppers. Before the first Lillywhite
revolutionised cricket all the bowling was under-
arm, but he introduced swinging of the ball with
elbow uplifted, and set the pattern for what was a
deadly “round-arm,” until “over-arm” supplanted
it. Small boys learning to bowl round-arm would
assume the title of Lillywhite as though it were the
proudest in the land. Nowadays the memory of the
old innovator is kept vaguely familiar to a limited
public by a marble monument in Highgate (Lond.)
cemetery, the inscription whereon is surmounted by
a carving of three stumps displaced by a fatal
cricket ball—life’s wicket taken at last. The
allegory in stone is effective, but the inscription,
which used to enjoy an early Victorian reputation
for impressiveness, has deteriorated into an offen-
sively absurd relic of the dark ages of social class
distinction and pious piffle. As an illustration of
how the ancient cricket world went round, Lilly-
white’s epitaph in Highgate Cemetery should be
framed in every cricket club. It is priceless:—
“This monument testifies to the respect of the
Noblemen and Gentlemen of the MaryleSone Cricket
Club, and of many Private Friends, to one who did
his duty in that state of life to which it had pleased
God to call him.”
And whilst that inscription is not yet a hundred
years old this impatient young country persists in
wondering why annual matches between “Gentle-
men” and “Players” are still announced in the old
land of the same old M.C.C.!

THE BETTER RING.
[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
“Joe Beckett, the heavyweight champion boxer,
has taken up bookmaking. He was a prominent figure
when shouting the odds in Tattersall’s ring at the
Epsom meeting.”— -London cable.
I strove with lots. In many a willing fray
My mark upon the foe I set and sealed,
Till twice, before Carpentier, felled 1 lay.
And now I lay the field.
1 sought to box my way to wealth and fame,
But in the end too oft I struck a snag,
And so determined to acquire the same
Per medium of the bag.
Encased in four-ounce gloves this massive fist
Of mine has peppered many likely lads,
But pugs encounter risks that don’t exist
For those who pepper prads.
Within the ropes 1 met my match, ’tis true,
And the k.o. incontinently took —
Show me the Dempsey among punters who
Can hand it to a book!
Dazed in the brain-box, spinal column jarred,
I dropped beneath the agile Frenchman’s blow —
But where’s the man can hit me half as hard
Here, where I keep my dough?
In war-time if you saw a better ’ole
To leave the one that held you was the; thing.
And this appears to me, upon my soul,
A vastly better ring
Than that wherein falls on each bruiser’s frame
According to deserts his whack of lash,
Here where the only punches that they aiip
Are in the form of cash.

Ben Tillett, M.P., is reported to have fol-
lowed the example of Tom Mann, and gravi-
tated to the retail-liquor business, having in-
vested £20,000 in a London pub. Ben is 64
now. He has been in the union-secretary
line for 37 years, but was late of arriving in
Parliament, which he reached only in 1917.
Tom O’Callaghan, Victorian Police Chief
till he retired 14 years ago, entered on his
80th year the other day. When .he retired
most people thought he was foolish to prefer
a pension of £6OO to a lump sum of £4000;
but he has doubled the £4OOO already. He
was the first president of the A.N.A. under
its new form of government introduced in
’77.
“Facet Spera” ; I believe I hold one of the
most singular army-discharge certificates. It
reads; “J— M- M— served no days em-
bodied service, no days active service, is
hereby discharged medically unfit!” The
explanation is that the doctor passed me into
the army under the Derby scheme for Home
Service, and I duly collected a day’s pay
and one day’s ration money, but a later
medical board threw me out again.
Ex-Attorney-General. Daugherty has ex-
plained why President Coolidge called on
him to resign, and why he complied:—
The Communist movement began in the United
States three years ago to destroy confidence in the
American form of government. To this end, con-
fidence in men of both political parties had to be
destroyed at any cost.
It recalls Horatio Bottomley, who attributed
the interest in his doings shown by Liberty
Bond holders a couple of years ago to the
machinations of Little Englanders.
“H.K.”: Reggie Black, N. S. Wales
M.L.C., had more than a passing interest in
the visit of the British squadron to Sydney.
His grandfather, John Black, was the origi-
nal skipper of the vessel which afterwards
became Australia’s first man-o’-war. She
was the Harbinger, an armed brig of 56
tons, with six guns, carrying a crew of 2(1
and general merchandise. She was the first
trading ship to reach Sydney through Bass
Strait, arriving in Port Jackson on January-
-13, 1801. Governor King bought her for
£7OO and re-named her the Norfolk.
“Gin Sling’s” note from Samoa: —
Ex-German Samoa’s first Parliamentary election
was held in January, when three members were
returned to the Leg. Council; the six other members
are nominated by the Crown. The elected three
consist of a half-caste merchant, a trader and the
local tinsmith. The new members have pledged
themselves to try to have prohibition lifted, but
it looks as if they are up against a stiff proposi-
rion, in the present temper of the M.L. Government.
Meantime, methylated spirits and home-brewed hect-
are the most popular tipples. An overdose of the
former is supposed to have had something to do
with the recent theft of an auxiliary ketch carrying
a full cargo, valued at some thousands. But .the
missionaries blame the moving-pictures.
“Dido”: The vagueness of these country
lovers! A wedding was under way at the
little weatherboard chapel at Wanderers'
Rest, and Watty Dodd was betraying a
strange and painful reluctance as ’groom. At
a crucial point in the service he broke away,
but two or three hefty brothers of tne briue
intercepted him, and advised him not to be
shy. “You might get your back lamed,
\\atty, old man,” said one. “Or your neck
bruck,” interjected another. So Dodd re-
turned to the altar and the ceremony pro-
ceeded. But again the man jibbed at the
definite word. “I can’t do it, mister,” he
said to the parson. “This is the wrong sis-
ter!” “The wrong sister!” said the pastor
helplessly. “Yes, this is Mary, and I wanted
Sue.” Fortunately there was still time to
meet the bridegi-oom’s wishes. In the “ves-
try” Mary doffed the orange-blossoms and
Sue donned them, and the marriage ceremony
proceeded to a happy close. All the reject
said was : “Well, why didn’t the fool say
which of us he wanted?”
“Zanthus” on an ancient horror: —
In the latest volume issued of the Historical
Records of Australia (No. 19 of tiie series) will be
found the despatches of Governor Gipps relating to
the Myall Creek massacre, perhaps the blackest of
all the atrocities perpetrated on the aboriginal
owners of the continent, and also memorable as one
of the comparatively few cases in Which white men
suffered the extreme penalty for the murder of
natives. The massacre occurred on Sunday, June
10, 1838, at Henry Dangar’s cattle station on the
banks of Myall Creek, in the far north of N.S.W.,
and then on the very edge of settlement. When
rumors of this deed of blood reached Sydney, two or
three weeks later, Gipps at once sent Day, a stipen-
diary magistrate, and a party of mounted police in
search of the murderers. Day returned to Sydney
at the end of 53 days bringing back 11 out of the
12 men concerned in the massacre. Though Day had
laid his plans carefully and fallen unexpectedly
on the station, one of the wanted men,
named John Fleming, had escaped him. Tradition
says that Fleming rode night and day to Sydney, a
distance of 350 miles, and took ship overseas. He
was a free man born in the colony; the other II
were all ex-convicts, though some of them had served
their sentences and earned their freedom. For some
weeks before the massacre about 50 natives —men,
women and children—-had been living peacefully and
harmlessly at the stations, but chiefly at Dangar’s.
On the Sunday afternoon, for what reason was never
clearly Established, the white men surrounded over
30 of the blacks, tied them with ropes and took
them to a hollow-, where all except a woman and
four children w-ere killed. Next day the murderers
scoured the country on horseback trying to find 10
of 12 blacks who had left the station on the Sunday
morning, and so escaped. These blacks were not seen
or heard of again, but it was not clearly proved
that they had been murdered. When Day arrived,
the remains of the slaughtered natives had been
burned, but undeniable evidence was obtained that
more than 20 human heads were counted on the spot
a few days after the massacre. The 11 men were
charged with the murder of a native man called
Daddy and all were acquitted. Seven of them were
then charged with the murder of a child called
Charley, and were found guilty. After condemnation
none of the men attempted to deny his guilt; but
they w-ere uhanimous in regarding it as an injustice
that white men should be put to death for killing
blacks. Many others shared this sentiment, for Gipps
received four petitions in favor of the murderers
from Sydney, Parramatta, Windsor and Patrick’s
Plains. At Patrick’s Plains £3OO was raised to
pay for the defence, and Robert Scott, a magistrate
of the district, visited the men in prison and advised
them to stick together, as there was po direct evidence
against them. Gipps, however, refused to interfere,
and on December 18 the seven men were duly
hinged. Gipps says it w-as pretty certain (his own
w-ords) that one of the four who escaped was the
most guilty of all.

Gounod’s “Faust” remains most popular
of operas amongst the merely moderately
musical, and Melba as Marguerite had the
multitude massing around Melbourne Ma-
jesty’s last Thursday. Moreover, the multi-
tude enthused immoderately, although this
was in only one respect the best treatment of
the opera the city has seen. The ballet in
the second act was that one respect. Instead
of a self-conscious dozen of adult coryphees
dancing their way into the Nuremberg
market-place, a lot of madchens romped upon
the scene like schoolgirls. Others thinly
disguised as boys came after them, and they
danced in couples or individually until the
stage seemed possessed by the spirit of. youth,
and the opera received a needed impetus.
Till then proceedings had been slow.
Huberdeau is the dullest of Mephistos. His
basso voice, which may have been rich once, has
lost some of its velvet pile; his appearance
is solemnly elderly, and his manner dispirit-
ing. He offers no excuse for the sale or
barter of Faust’s soul. There is nothing of
the breezy tempter about him. A sluggish,
stodgy Devil—dignified, but forbidding. Led
around by so mature a gentleman in red,
Borgioli never was an easy, debonair gallant
(smiling not being Borgioli’s strong suit in
any character), while an unbecoming
fifteenth-century costume probably put the
shapely tenor out of conceit with himself.
A profusion of grease-paint distinguished
Borgioli’s face early in the season, but now
that it had been too severely wiped off he
was no longer lovely. However, his agree-
able tenor voice left no cause for complaint,
and as a sorrowful Faust in the closing scene
he was quite all right. Alfred. Maguenat
made a good Valentine, his diction singu-
larly easy to follow. He is even more French
than Huberdeau. and his ringing nasal tones
proclaim the baritone from La Belle France.
Aurora Rettore was a sweet and mild Siebel,
Vera Bedford a capital Martha as
usual, and the chorus charming on the female
side; but the soldiers back from the war
looked as though they had lost the flower of
their army. Frank St. Leger conducted cap-
ably, and Melba was a Marguerite who sur-
prised old admirers by the sustained force
of her warhle right up to Marguerite’s death-

knock, as well as by the art of an inter-
pretation which is undoubtedly more con-
vincing than it was a dozen years ago.
Everybody knew that time has made Melba
a wonderful woman among great singers.
But she is eVen more than that —she is a
marvel in the circumstances.
* * * ©
“Samson and Delilah,” by Saint Saens,
arrived on Saturday. The brief and gloomy
opera has a more appealing moral than
“Faust,” for whereas Goethe’s story chiefly
excites pity for an old dodderer who sold
himself to perdition for a physical trans-
formation which can now be bought with an
infusion of monkey gland, the temptation and
undoing of Samson remind us that Delilah
was mother of all Vamps. Furthermore, tne
collapse of the Philistine temple, when Sam-
son pushes two pillars at once, shows that
shameful profiteering by building contractors
was prevalent in 1150 8.c., or earlier. The
music of Saint Saens is tuneful and appropri-
ate to the theme. Still it encourages depres-
sion. Once in a way “Samson and Delilah”
is welcome, yet it might drop out of fasnion
without being missed. “The Sign of the
Cross,” set to music, would be more enter-
taining. Phyllis Archibald, with an attrac-
tive personality and a seductive wave of the
arms—a sort of longshore mermaid in old
Gaza —scores a popular success as Delilah,
though she strikes one as being a mezzo
singing in contralto strains, and not a power-
ful mezzo at that. She sang very sweetly
on Saturday the song that helped to lure
Samson to his doom, the job being completed
by a clap of thunder which sent him scurry-
ing into her house to escape the coming storm.
With a different lover than Marques she
might have been happier in a duet. But
Marques, the tremolo tenor, makes a difficult
Samson to duet with, nor was he an interest-
ing Biblical character before or after the
cutting of his hair. Perhaps he was most
effective when posing in the tableau ending
of the first act. Luigi Ceresol, in excellent
voice, did well as the baritone High Priest.
Also the work of the fresh: girl choristers, and
the men who are not so fresh, suggested that
it will be still better after further rehearsal,
a remark that applies equally to the ballet of
youthful Philistines who had been so spon-
taneously gladsome as frauleins in “Faust.”
Picturesque stage setting keeps the eye busy,
but the orchestra often becomes rather too-
too. It is deafening at its loudest, and too
loud in its accompaniment to the leading
lady. Indexed, it is now a common complaint
against conductor Paolantonio that he allows
the orchestra too much license at moments
when voices cry aloud for consideration.

but the fiery young woman loves him at first

acted as before. The only new production

There is nothing doing at Melbourne
King’s until Saturday this week, when Oscar
Asche will produce Galsworthy’s “The Skin
Game.” Galsworthy’s play threatens to up-
lift public taste, and the unlooked-for return
of Asche is an interesting event to begin with.,
At Melbourne Princess’s one more week
remains for “The O’Brien Girl” ere “Tan-
gerine” comes due for revival. Meantime
the smile of Mamie Watson amounts to a
benediction, May Beatty retains authority
over Mark Daly except for five minutes of
glorious insurrection, and the activities of
June Roberts, Hazel Harris and Co. are
beautifully limber.

“The Cabaret Girl” is still the same old
musical comedy with gleams of difference at
Melbourne Royal. This show improves on
acquaintance, in so far that a madly improb-
able plot reveals itself to close observation,
and an author’s purpose becomes dimly per-
ceptible amidst the medley, like the designs
of Providence in an earthquake.

The bill at Melbourne Tivoli includes more
items than Arthur Prince, the ventriloquist,
and Bert Coote and Co. in a farcical melo-
drama ; but these are the things that most
matter when the jury retires.
At Hoyt’s Melbourne house this week
Hoot Gibson, after taming a wild hoss in
a sensational manner, cuts out the most
notable girl from the mob and has kisses and
doughboys ever after. He is fondly termed
“The Ramblin’ Kid.” The Russian Revolu-
tion and the Jap earthquake are heavy supers
in the drama of “Torment” which follows,
and they monopolise so much film that it has
been found impossible to squeeze in the war
and the Melbourne tram-men’s strike —the
latter sadly interfering with the week’s
shows. The Majestic’s poser, “Wlmt’s
a Wife Worth’?” ought to be decided
by secret ballot. The film doesn’t
afford the slightest enlightenment on
the subject. “The Country Kid,” also
on the Majestic screen, is Wesley Barry dis-
guised by another crop of freckles and a hat
in which ferrets have held a gymkhana. It
is a humble out-back story, in which a crusty
uncle shows a hard heart. “In the Name of
the Law,” at the Britannia, features the.
latest bank robbery; while everything pre-
viously lovely in the garden at the Melba is
voted inferior to “The White Rose.”
The Vic. Artists’ annual show:—
A disagreeable feature of it is the casual drawing
of the portrait-painters. W. B. Mclnnes has a pleas-
ing study of a Titian-haired girl toying with an
amber necklace, but the thumb of her right hand
is almost as long as the forefinger and appears to
have two knuckles. Equally perfunctory painting of
tfie neck and shoulders, which seem to be welling
over the edge of the corsage, spoils the same artist’s
otherwise admirable portrait of Mrs. Arthur Young.
A little further down on the same wall George Bell
appends his signature to a view of Daryl Lindsay, whose

pants are so flatly painted that'it is hard to 'believe
they contain legs. The" placid lady on whom Tom
Carter lavishes much pigment and 'canvas has a
defective right arm, and the uncommonly studious
youth in J. Henness>-’s “Hofrre-Lessofre” is wearing
, more cheek on the left side than js anatomically
allowable. Charles Wheeler, who : is generally a sound
draughtsman, cannot possibly be satisfied with the
throat shadow in K A Study” (No. 111). His'picture
of a: young lady, posed on a fallen tree, is technically
correct, but it is almost as pretty and artificial as
the highly embellished snapshots of suburban life
which Hardy Tiarks hangs gin the central gallery.
F. G. Reynolds is represented by a self-portrait, which
is more attractive than his impression of actor Allan
Wilkie, while C. Swinton Diston’s head of a young
woman suggests pre-Raphaelite influence. In land-
scape work improvement is definite and distinguished
in the case of Victor Zelman, who is keeping his
art unsullied by academic conventions, while achieving
an almost lyric intensity with his cool, true color.
W. D. Knox remains a gifted reporter of summer
haze and ispacious vistas; J.'Beament :maintains:'his A
standard of uncompromising realism; and W. S.
Wemyss gets a mention for his sketch of the Croy-
don Valley. C-. -E, Mudie is a new-name- in the
catalogue, and his three or tour efforts deserve .a
better position than has been allotted to them. Harold
Herbert, R. W. Sturgess and George Benson head
the field in Jfie "water-color section. Herbert'“con-
tinues his ingratiating grey manner, and Sturgess
finds contentment in his romantic visions-'.:pf still
days, whereas Benson, differing strongly from both
in method, produces something as solid and satis-"
fying as a good landscape in oils.
As far as his Sydney season has gone,
Charles Hackett was on the seventh wave of
his art on Thursday night. The “Tosca”
numbers with which he met his audience
were probably his best efforts of the week,
and from the kick-off to the goalpost his
work was of "the carry-all-before-it type. Be-
cause of the “Questa 6 Quella” encore, the
inclusion of the cloying “Because” must be
forgiven him. The tenor sings the music of
I-landel with dignity. Rosa’s “Star Vicino”
and the haunting “Duna” continue two of
his best interpretations. But the.lrish bal-
lad is beyond him —on Saturday night he
contrived to make “Nora O’Neil” another
injustice to Ireland; and in some of his
numbers he gives the impression of fumbling"
for his words. The Schubert Serenade and
Massenet’s Elegie, with positively dangerous
support from Bratza’s fiddle and Raybould’s
keyboard, won’t get an opportunity to be
moth-eaten during the Australian tour, judg-
ing by the loud hand they received on Satur-
day. Bratza has overcome his initial coy-
ness about letting his violin be heard in its
most tender moments, and the result is an
increased richness of tone appreciated by
backseaters. The big works from the pens of
Beethoven, Grieg, Schubert, Kreisler and
Corelli have been drawn on by the gifted
youngster—his repertoire seems as inex-
haustible as his modesty.

There’s a week more to be glad in, and
mirthful too, and mad in, ere taking leave
of Ada Reeve, that scrumptious boy “Alad-
din.” It’s at Sydney New Palace; but there
isn’t a handy rhyme for that.
“Tons of Money” is in its last jingling
weeks at Sydney Grand Opera House.

“The Garden of Allah,” at Sydney Royal,
is still featuring the Sahara swept by a
devastating simoom, and Muriel Starr and
Frank Harvey racked by soul-searing emo-
tions.
“Ma Mie Rosette” has another eight
nights to run at Her Majesty’s, Sydney:
tuneful Gladys Moncrieff’s next booking is
for a holiday trip to Europe. The play was
robbed of its pastoral-romantic flavor on
Saturday night when youthful celebrants of
the G.P.S. boatrace converted it into some-
thing more like a pantomime.
Sydney Cri. houses continue to rock with
hilarity as the curtain falls upon the comedy
and the title of “Aren’t We All?” The
Vanbrugh-Boucicault combination was never
shown to more advantage.

At Sydney Tivoli Steppin and Scea juggle
with more than average adroitness: Jay
Laurier sings the touching ballad of “Dirty
Little Emily Brown” with cmpressement and
full facial accompaniments; Florence Smith-
son brings het tuneful voice and glittering
presence from Cockaigne; and Will Hay
makes the hit of the evening with another
of his “schoolmaster” sketches —a bit of
wholesome, clever fooling, with Alfred Gar-
cier and Bert Platt as capital offsiders. The
closing item, Bailey’s posing dogs, is Clevel-
and original.

“Anna Christie,” a Swedish damsel, left
in the lurch by a cousin and wooed by a
brawny coal-shoveller, is at Hoyt’s, in Syd-
ney. “Shadows of the North",” Hoyt’s other
lodger, is a course of lessons in claim-jump-
ing and canoe-wrecking. Bill Hart has a
lease of the Empress, where as “Wild Bill
Hickok”. he gives demonstrations five times
daily in quick shooting. ‘Tn the Name of
the Law” keeps'the Lyceum restless; each
succeeding sub-title precedes a bigger thrill.
“Good Women,” at the same house, has a
cosmopolitan flavor. An American heiress
elopes with a Russian pianist to Italy, but
the romance ends in the land of black-shirted
Fascisti, ~and the heiress prizes her return
boat-ticket above all other possessions. The
Lyric Wintergarden has---“ The Eleventh
Hour”; the blowing-up of an island fights
for pride of place with a battle with lions.
“A Woman of Paris” still has her meals at
the Crystal Palace.
Some good pictures have been seen in
Adelaide lately. “Penrod and Sam,” at
the • York-, is not as - funny as the book,
through deviating into sentiment oyer the
death of a dog. Another unboomed item in
-the same programme,“Arabia’s-Last-Alarm,
with, a well-trained dog and a comic nigger,
is one of the funniest things lately seen on the
screen. On the other hand, the York’s

pre-war Vienna, is quite disappointing. Won-

chantress, and the “Virginian” mixture of

“Fax”: Last week an alteration in the
programme told of trouble in the Italian
opera camp. The second performance of
“Trovatore” had been announced for Thurs-
day night, and many seats were booked. But
on Tuesday the early-bookers were told that
“owing to unforeseen circumstances” the per-
formance of “Trovatore” would not happen,
and people who had paid for their seats could
have their money returned. “Tosca” would
be substituted. The “unforeseen circs.” were
apparently due to the fact that the success
of Phyllis Archibald as the gipsy had been
as conspicuous on the first night as the dis-
satisfaction of the Leonora lady, who took
the “calls” frowningly while Phyllis was
smiling hard. The cast for the next per-
formance of “Trovatore,” when it comes to
pass, will doubtless differ from what was
previously announced.
“0.K.”: Hugh Ward (who, by the way,
has decided on “Cinderella” for his next
Melbourne panto.) is counting on a longer
winter season in Adelaide than the S.A. city
ordinarily provides for a musical comedy co.
It will be Ward’s first managerial venture
there, and he will stage the three comedies
the co. has done in Melbourne within IS
months —“O’Brien Girl,” “Tangerine” and
“Nellie Kelly”—with every attention to
detail.
“S.T.S.” : Adelaide Repertory Theatre has
issued with modest pride a list of well over
100 plays it has staged since its start in
1908. The list includes 11 by Shaw, five
each by Galsworthy and Arnold Bennett,
four each by Synge and Yeats, and nearly all
the serious playwrights are represented.
From outside Britain Ibsen was drawn on
for six, Maeterlinck'for three, and Strind-
berg, Sudermann, Turgenieff, Rostand,
Brieux and Schnitzler for one each. Aus-
tralian talent had a look in with four plays
by Arthur Adams, four by the Adelaide law-
yer who writes as Alec Somerville, and one
by Louis Esson.
“Up Stage”: Allan Priora, whose fine
tenor was praised in the P.P. column,
lias an important part in Shubert’s
latest New York revue. Delysia heads a
huge cast, and among the also-rans is
Frank Greene. Frank was imported by
the J.C.W. firm to play leading rdles, but
the best Priora was offered was a job in the
chorus. Now it is the other way about, or
nearly so. I saw Priora in the J.C.W. office
looking wistfully at closed doors, and advised
him to try some other country. He has done
so, and the closed doors have been opened.
Yet the dreadful publicity bird persists in
squawking about what the management does
to encourage local talent.
“Tito”: Conductor Paolantonio and bari-
tone Granforte, of the opera co., hail from
Buenos Ayres. Paolantonio was born there,
and Granforte emigrated to the sprawling
capital, there to toil in a brewery and eke
out his midget income by singing in cafes.
Paolantonio is above the average of even
Italy’s high standard as a conductor and
composer. Though only 36, he has been
guilty of three symphonies, which have been
mentioned in musical despatches from Milan.
Incidentally, he is said to be the double of
THE BUSINESS TAINT.
ARTIST: “Of course, it depends upon how
much money you are going to give me.”
EDITOR: “Money! Goodness me, I thought
you were an artist, not a business
man!”
Norman Lindsay, but on searching liim for
points of resemblance I find nothing but
the slight physique to recall the Australian.
“Pedro”: I hold it truth with him (“Old-
tyme, B. l/5/’24) who sings that Harwood
was one of the drollest of comedians. In
“The Private Secretary” Thornton was ad-
mittedly a perfect copy of Penley, recog-
nisedly the funniest English exponent of the
part; but when Harwood played the iras-
cible uncle it was impossible to say which
actor was in the star role. Harwood was
also a very fine stage-manager, though so
strict as to prompt one old stagehand to
say, “I don’t deny that ’Olloway is flinty,
very flinty; but ’Arwood—’Arwood’s a per-
fect marionette!”
“First Robber”: I can’t say whether
Miln ever alternated lago and Othello with
Leake (B. 24/4/’24), but he certainly did it
with George Ireland at Hobart in 1889.
Alfred Dampier used to swap the roles with
Ned Holloway. Ireland also played Othello
at Melb. Royal in ’B6, to the lago of George
Titheradge. He did King Claudius about
the same time to Tith.’s Hamlet, Leake being
the Ghost (I think), Billy Elton the Grave-
digger, and Mary Weir (now Mrs. J. C.
Williamson) the Player Queen.
“Santander”: Concerning the Carmens
that Melbourne has seen (B. l/5/’24), I vote
Agnes Janssen the most melodious, and
award the prize for vixenish realism to our
present visitor, Lahoska. In her way La-
hoska is more
truthful to the
type than even
Calve, who radi-
ated a luscious
seductiveness, but
always seemed a
cut above Car-
men’s station in
life. Blah e h e
Arral, who was
once Micaela to
Calve’s Carmen in
Paris, was another
who played Meri-
mee’s heroine in
Melbourne, but she
had no gipsy blood
in her veins. It
was rather the
pale fluid of the
Faubourg St. Ger-
main. De Cisneros
was not exactly a
keg of gunpowder
in the famous part.
She was really less
desirable than
Russ, whose rather
worn mezzo was
exhibited with the
Gonsalez Co., and
Russ sang With
the finest Esca-
millo I have heard,
the gallant and
energetic Sca-
muzzi. The first
Carmen to sing in
the Vic. capital was Rose Hersee, whose hus-
band was responsible for an English version
four years after the original’s premiere in
Paris.
“Royce Rolls”: Eleonora Duse, who has
died in America* Was Bernhardt’s greatest
rival, and many good critics, including Bern-
ard Shaw, considered that she was the finer
actress. Her habit of dispensing with make-
up, and even with corsets on occasion,
seemed the acme of naturalism to Shaw in
1893, when he had the pleasure of compar-
ing her with the famous Frenchwoman in
“Magda,” and noted that the Gaul’s blush
was painted, whereas the Italian could pro-
duce the real article at an embarrassing
moment of the drama. Both Duse and Bern-
hardt won their earliest successes in “Tosca,”
“Camille” and “Fedora,” though the Italian
was later on to show a more mature talent
in “Hedda Gabler.” “The Lady from the
Sea” and “A Doll's House.” She appeared
once in “Othello,” and was urged to copy
Sarah by doing Hamlet. Her reply was
that enough had been done already to unsex
the Dane.
From a London first-nighter:—
Sardou’s “Diplomacy” has been revived at the
Adelphi, chiefly to give the reigning stage beauty,
Gladys Cooper, a chance of starring in a Bernhardt
part. Gladys is riot equal to requirements. Aus-
tralia’s old friend Irene Browne makes a much more
commanding and artistic success as the Countess Zicka.
In a public debate with Cicely Hamilton, the
dramatist, Marshall Hall, K.C., mentioned that
“Charley’s Aunt” travelled so badly during the first
few weeks of its presentation in London that W. S.
Penley wanted to Sell it. “You can have the d—d
thing for £500,” he said to the barrister. Luckily
for Penley, the man of law didn’t bite.
Marie Lohr arid her husband have migrated to the
Comedy, where they announce for early production
a new play by Sutro, “Far Above Rubies.” Marie
Tempest is to help the younger Marie.
Australians shouldn’t miss “Lilac Time,” which
recently scored its StTOt'h consecutive performance at
the Lyric. It was turned down by eight successive
London managers, arid its first reception was frosty.
But it soon caught the public fancy, thanks largely
to Clara But ter worth.
“Box and Cox,” Which used to amuse our grandads
and ’mas, has been resurrected at the Coliseum, and
is drawing great houses. The old farce was a
familiar after-piece at Melb. Royal when Coppin,
Harwood and Stewart ruled the roost. Then it
was the fashion to start with a comedietta, in which
the junior members df the co. appeared; then came
a full-sized dratria in four or five acts; finally
“Box and Cox” or some other farce. Those were
the good-measure days. Now it is a case of more
pay and much less quantity, leaving quality out
of the argument.
“Buz Fuz”: The Hippodrome management
having lured Maude Fane from that “little
farm in Surrey,” the lady is billed in London
as a “soprano from Australia.” Non-
Australian actresses are wonderfully kind in
adopting this continent for advertising pur-
poses. Wasn’t it the ’Frisco-born Tittell
Brune who was introduced to the Fog as
“Australia’s Greatest Dramatic Actress”?
“T.P.”: My memory has a longer span
than “O.K.’s” (B. 24/4/’24), for I can
recollect “Richelieu” being done at Melb.
Bijou by William Creswick. That was years
before the Brough and Boucicault production;
it ante-dated even the arrival of the elder
Boucicault with young Dot and little sister
Nina. G. R. Ireland was De Mauprat, to
Creswick’s Richelieu, and the night I saw
the play, in the scene where De Mauprat, in
full armor, has to show his grim visage to
the astonished Cardinal, the hinge of his
helmet wouldn’t work. Ireland tugged and
tugged, ripping out some very audible
THE FILM AND THE HERO.

SYLVIE: “Then why doesn’t your chest move up and down like
they do in the pictures?”
damns, and Creswick grinned hugely when
an obliging galleryite expressed his willing-
ness to introduce the pair, seeing that George
was having trouble with “ ’ees ’at.”
“L.H.P.”: “V.V.” (B. 17/4/’24) is wrong
in stating that “Les Cloches de Corneville”
and “The Crown Diamonds” were staged for the
first time in Sydney by the Lyster Opera Co.
in November, 1880. “Crown Diamonds” was
first given by Lyster at the old Prince of
Wales’s Theatre in 1863, with Rosalie
Durand as Caterina. “Les Cloches” was
first staged at the old York-street Opera
House in February of 1880 by the Kelly-
Leon combination. Leon, a great impersona-
tor of females, played Serpolette, Emma
Wangenheim was Germaine, Kelly was the
miser and Vernon Reid the tenor fisherman.
“Very 0.T.”: “Oldtyme” (B. 10/4/'24)
is less than just to Nellie Mortyne. The
“foggy tones” which are alleged to have
handicapped her histrionic career did not
prevent her from getting engagements with
Tree, Wyndham, Alexander, Mrs. Patrick
Campbell, Bourchier and Edward Terry, or
with Grossmith and Laurillard, in be-
tween her many appearances with J. C. Wil-
liamson companies. As for Nellie’s “periodical
absences,” one of them was to have been the
last, but the Great Adventure (not Arnold
Bennett’s) intervened, and the lady returned
to do her duty to the son who had suffered
in doing his duty to his country. Nor did
she find herself “almost forgotten” by a
public w r hich she has served loyally and well.
“Up Stage” : “0.K.” (B. 24/4/’24) is not
correct when he says that Bill Leake
played Othello to Miln’s lago at Melbourne
Opera House in 1889. Dampier was the
Moor. Also, Richelieu was done by Miln
(he was the Cardinal, and Douglas, Ireland,
Cathcart and Greenaway figured in the pro-
duction) ; but it was put on as a stopgap at
the tag end of the season, and did not com-
mand much attention. Probably that accounts
for “O.K.’s” missing it. Miln took extraordi-
nary liberties with the text, and delighted
in playing tunes on his really marvellous
voice—a habit of his when business
was bad. In an oft-misquoted sentence
Richelieu has to say to Francois: “In the
lexicon of youth which fate reserves for a
bright manhood there is no such word as
fail.” One night, looking hard at a par-
ticularly bad house, Miln made it: “In the
lexicon of youth which fate reserves for a
bright manhood there is, by Gad, such a
word as fail.” He walked up stage and
down, and patted Francois on the head.
“But, of course, as you would say, there is
no such word as fail. Brave boy, brave
boy.”
HISTORICAL ROMANCE IN AN AMERICAN
SETTING.
[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
When Edward Sparks from Kandahar
Set out on foot for Turkestan
He found a village set afar
Between green hills, below a star,
Where half a pleasant river ran.
The village walls were all of mud —-
Most gentle walls of sunburnt brown —
And soft-eyed cattle chewed the cud
Beside the ripples of the flood
Watching the yellow sunbeams drown.
The gate was not a gate at all,
Judged by the plain use of the word,
But just an opening in the wall
Where sat a patriarch hoar and tall
Beaked like a heavy desert bird.
His beard was trailing on the ground;
The hairs upon his head were few.
He made no sign, he made no sound,
But Edward, after looking round,
Asked the plain question “Who are you?”
The ancient raised his sagging chin
And gazed on him with heavy pain,
As one who nurses ancient sin ;
And then his voice came hard and thin
As breaking cinders, “I am Cain.”
“What, the old chap we read about
Who smashed his brother with a stone?”
“That’s me,” he said, “without a doubt,
Although I really broke the lout
With a thick-ended mammoth bone.”
“What was the row about?” said Sparks.
Cain shrugged his mighty shoulders high—
“He was the chief of all the narks.
He sang of moonbeams, dawns and larks ;
And so, of course, he had to die.”
“But tell me,” Edward said in haste,
“After the finish of the strife,
When you went out to learn the taste
Of misery in the outer waste,
How did you come to find a wife?”
“A wife?” the hoary patriarch cried —-
His rugged brow was seamed and bent—
“ Why, don’t you know, when Abel died
The girl was standing at my side?—
I took her with me when I went.”
Cain rose and shook the dust like chaff;
He raised aloft his mighty head.
A Titan leaning on a staff,
Ten feet of him began to laugh—•
“The girl, of course, was English bred.”
“English!” cried Sparks. The purple dusk
Was falling on the Asian land.
He breathed a scent of rose and musk ;
A thin moon, like a dragon’s tusk,
Above the mountains seemed to stand.
“English ! Well, British, if you like.
I took her to my desert tent,
Then bore her on a motor-bike
Some other, happier vale to strike—
I told you that she came from Kent.”
“Are you the Sheik of Araby?”
Cried Edward with a sudden joy.
“Ah, tell me, tell me you are he
Whom all the women throng to see.”
The ancient said “I am, my boy.”
So on each other’s necks they fell
With pleasure that was half a groan ;
And from the palm-girt village well
A harsh voice rose into a yell,
Directing through a megaphone.
Then Alexander, Kublai Khan,
Clive, Adam, Zoroaster, Ming,
Confucius and another man
Came out just as the lights began
A radiance on the walls to fling.
Eve strolled half naked through a grove
Of oranges that looked like soap ;
And Jacob with an angel strove,
While Cyrus in his chariot drove
A hundred yards along the slope.
And all the while the moral stood
Where all might read it at a glance.
There in that village drear and rude
Was seen the triumph of the good
Set in historical romance.

does away with friction
between one part
and another
because LISTER design provides for a more
thorough and more positive system of oil
distribution to all moving parts. Thus the
main spindle in the LISTER handpiece runs
in a long oil bath —there is no friction, there-
fore no running hot, and only a minimum of
wear. Further, the oil-returning grooves on
the spindle keep the oil from running out the
tail of the shear, so that lubrication is certain
and waste is cut out. On the overhead
bracket a siphon-feed to the friction-arm
bearing—instead of the more usual needle-
feed—not only ensures that oil does get
through, but also that only clean oil gets
through.
between shearer
and expert
because LISTER Handpieces are easier to keep
up to the mark. Perfectly level tension—
seldom obtained with other pattern Crown
Plates, and the source of constant trouble
between shearers and expert—is automatically
guaranteed by the LISTER Patent Crown
Plate. Tension Nuts give no trouble when
the LISTER Adjustable Split Lid-Bush is
fitted, and so with many other parts of the
Handpiece. LISTER Combs and Cutters take
a keener edge and hold it longer than any
others. Apart from the grinding, shearers
using LISTER machines very rarely have to
trouble the expert from first blow to cut-out.
between manager
and owner
because the shearing expenses and the annual
repair bills are ever so much lower with
LISTER than with other machines. Shearing
costs less because LISTERS are on the job the
whole time—no vexatious or expensive delays
because a stand i§ out of action every now
and then. Shearers are kept in good humor
and work quicker and cleaner. Repairs are
less because, firstly, LISTER Machines are a
British-built product of the highest standard,
both in material and workmanship. That is
a guarantee of longer life. Secondly, the
LISTER design allows for so many more “on-
the-spot” repairs than other machines that
the expense of sending work away hundreds
of miles is avoided.
Altogether, LISTER is the “one best bet” for anyone needing shearing machinery, whether
of the standard overhead type or for a portable outfit. Our Bulletin 145 will remove any
hesitation you may have about the value of LISTER machines. Write to the nearest of us
for a copy.

To Get the Best and Pay the Least for It
is the aim of every sensible person. We exploded the old idea that to get the best-
quality goods it is necessary to get it from a big shop, as any reasonable-minded person
can understand that big firms, with expensive shop fronts, high rentals and heavy upkeep,
must add a bigger margin to pay for this unnecessary expenditure. Now as we have only
an upstairs showroom, our rent and expenses are extremely low. We sell you the same
article at least 20 per cent, below any shop or catalog prices. If we had shop rent to
pay we could not possibly give you the same-ouality goods at the price. Besides, vye
"ive you a written guarantee .with every purchase, also an undertaking in writing to
refund your money in full if you are not satisfied, or can buy cheaper elsewhere.

N.G.W.: Probably the Sepik, in New
Guinea. That river is navigable for 300 miles by
steamers drawing 10ft Forestall: You dawdle too
much for a paper that has to get right round
Australia once a week.... J.S.M.: “Autumn,” though
well enough done, is not for u 5.... Flagstaff: Too
vague and general. You ought to put in those

She loved in vain,
For she was plain,
And he was fine and fickle;

He’d soon be caught

In desperate hurry,
Awful flurry,
He rushed across the street;
A motor-car
Went too far
And killed him at her feet.
Half-fainting girl
All in a whirl—
“O love! we’ll meet again!”

And down she flopped
Raving and insane.

“He’s beckoning me
To come and see
The sights beyond the clouds.”

And drive a tip-dray along.
For I sit for hours, and wait for Inspiration,

Wallowing in words and rumination.
Brushing off th’ flies and trying to think
How to forge each conjecture link by link.

mon. ... A.N.D.: Far too much froth on your beer,

against Rockhampton (Q.) for the push-bike
stakes (B. 24/4/’24). The two-wheelers ar(
so thick in the irrigation town that a track
has been worn on either side of each main
road, and worn so hard that it’s better than
any footpath in wet weather. The High
School, with about, 250 boys on the rolls,
has had racks built to accommodate 20(1
“grids,” and it is rare to see one empty. Also
it’s common- to see .two or three

EVERSHARP,
Companion to

ONCE used, Eversharp becomes
as essential as your watch.
It is as beautiful, equally reliable
and as often used.
The patented tip—which pre-
vents the leads from wabbling or
loosening—makes Eversharp a dis-
tinctive pencil, not to be compared
with ordinary pencils.

A train 400 miles long
IF the Studebaker motor cars sold dur-
ing 1923 —more than 145,000 cars —
were packed in goods waggons, two to
a waggon, they would form a solid train
over 400 miles in length—approxi-
mately the distance from Melbourne
to Adelaide. The tremendous demand
for Studebaker motor cars has but one
answer —widespread recognition of
the high quality and value of the
Studebaker product It will pay you to
see the 13 Studebaker models—each a
“six,” and each backed by Studebaker’s
72 years of manufacturing experience.

Business, Robbery, etc.
“Alwyn”: Apropos the conversion of vari-
ous Sydney churches into commercial houses,
etc. (B. 3/4/’24), a one-time tabernacle at
Lithgow (N.S.W.) is now used as a
printery. Incidentally, within its walls,
years ago, was born a Labor weekly called
the Democrat. It was a very short-lived
venture. Nowadays there is still a hint of
the one-time sacred atmosphere of the place
in the signboard “The Do Good Printing
Works.”
“Saaedi”: Has anyone noticed that the
artesian flow—in N. S. Wales at least—is
almost everywhere diminishing? Not only
that, but the supply in sub-artesian bores
seems to be falling off also. The supply,
whether artesian or sub-artesian, is appa-
rently by no means inexhaustible, and it is
on the cards that a dryness will set in
before very long that will make grazing an
even more precarious proposition than it is
at present.
“Cfesar”: There will be no big ’possum
cheques in Bananaland this year, as Gillies,
Minister for Agriculture, has decided that
the season shall remain closed. This will
be a knock to those bad Australians who
hunt the furry one with flare-lamps and
cyanide. The snare is now regarded as a
primitive method of trapping. ’Possum-
lights and cyanide are prohibited, of course;
but the local John Hop can’t camp at the
foot of every gum-tree. If we are to pre-
serve the ’possum from extinction the season
might well be kept closed for a few years.
Even then a good deal of killing would go
on, the skins being stowed away against the
day of release.
* * * *
“Amapu”: Memories of the “good old”
whaling days in M.L. were awakened by the
recent arrival at Stewart Island of the Nor-
wegian expedition to the Ross Sea. There is
a parent ship of seven or eight thousand
tons and five small whale-chasers: the outfit
belongs to the Larsen Co., of Norway, which
has obtained from the M.L. Government a
three-year permit to operate. The ships have
just come up from five months in the Ross
Sea. Business was not very good, as a very
cold spell had driven the whales away from
their usual feeding-grounds. Nevertheless,
the total bag consisted of 221 blues, besides
numerous finbacks, which yielded 17,000
barrels of oil. The biggest cetacean gave
180 barrels, or 30 tons.
* * * *
“H.H.”: Although land values have
jumped enormously in Sydney of recent
years, some of them have even now hardly
reached the figures of 35 years ago. An ex-
ample is the block adjoining Holdsworth
Macpherson’s in George-street, near Bridge-
street, which was sold the other day pri-
vately for £5OO per foot. That is exactly
the price given in 1888 for it and all the
land down to the Bridge-street corner. To
finance the deal the purchaser borrowed
most of the money, and the mortgagees fore-
closed in 1908. They sold in 1909 and
could get only £312. In 1917 the purchaser
resold the block, but kept the pub on the
corner. He got £275 per foot. The block
was always a favored one; 90 years ago it
brought £35 per foot, which was then a
staggering price.
“R.F.K.F.”: How long will it be before
we begin to turn the shoals of sharks that
patrol our surf shores and estuaries into
commercial goods? Other countries are
doing it; some time ago the Australian
Bureau of Science and Industry received
from America samples of tanned shark-hide.
These hides vary from an inch in thickness
to paper-like fabric from the baby fish, and
make good leather for all sorts of purposes.
Dr. Gruvel, of France, says shark’s flesh is
rich in proteids and phosphoric acid, its
liver holds better oil than the cod’s, its bones
powder into fine fertilisers, its intestines
give gut for musical instruments, and its
head is full of glue. Sounds like puff-lines
in a mining prospectus; but when other
nations are working the shark for all it is
worth, why not Australia, which has such an
abundance of the raw material?
* * * *
“Adelaide”: The difference in State laws
causes an odd position here in South Aus.
over the lotteries so common in N.S.W. and
Queensland. One well-meaning affair went
so far as to send me a book of 25 shilling-
tickets, with an almost pathetic hope that
1 would return £1 to support the good cause
a town band in this case. Besides being
completely illegal here, this sweep bad no
attraction either as a gamble or as a charity,
so the book lay unnoticed: but a month later
came a follow-up letter, and there seemed to
be a possible liability by default if one did
nothing. So I simply handed tbe corres-
pondence to the police, who undertook to
point out gently to the promoters that a
thing that is all right on one side of an
imaginary line can be all wrong if it pokes
its nose oil the other. About the, same time
an Adelaide man who innocently tried to
sell some of the tickets in a similar affair
was hauled up for the offence and fined.
* * * *
“Parama”: I don’t know the present
value of ambergris—it was about £6 an
ounce in 1914 if I remember rightly—but
bait a ton of it in one lump is something
well worth picking up. Such a find is re-
ported to have been made off the coast of
Natal, S’Africa, while a whale was being
cut mi. 1 have often wondered what is the
largest find of ambergris off Australia. I’ve
lucked up fragments on the beaches of N.
Queensland, the adjacent islands and about
(lie Barrier Reef, but they were nothing
more than fragments. About five years ago
two white men missed a fortune through
ignorance. They’d been exploring the
Barrier Reef while their host remained on
board the lugger “working” trochas shell.
On their return to the boat they were hav-
ing a “spot” before feeding, when their host
showed them a piece of ambergris, a lucky
find made during the day, worth about £75.
Alter examining the stuff the two friends ex-
plained that they had seen a lump of the same
thing about the size of a man’s body, and
had kicked it, remarking that it was queer
coral rock. The skipper haunted the vicinity
for days, and went inch by inch over acres
of the reef, but the waves and tide must
have got in first.

An Achievement in
Simplified Construction
THE six cylinder Paige-Jewett is so
constructed that it will receive the
endorsement of the most expert
mechanic —yet so simplified and care-
ful in its engineering principles that a
motor car owner need have no knowl-
edge of mechanical details in order to
drive it year in and year out with little
or no trouble.
The longer one is associated with the
Paige-Jewett motor cars, the greater the
confidence in their ability to carry on
under all situations. Whether the road
be rough or the hill steep, the Paige-
Jewett will perform its bit without
labor or difficulty.
Arrange for a personal experience and
trial run.

MISS ELSIE PARKES,
the Beautiful Australian Actress and
Dancer appearing with the “Tons
of Money” Co., at the Opera House.
A Dainty Advocate of Mercolized
Wax for the Skin.
FOR A
BEAUTIFUL SKIN
Wash your face in warm water,
and while the skin is still damp
lightly smear a little pure mercolized
wax over your face and neck, and
leave on until the morning. After a
few nights of this treatment the
blemishes on your skin should dis-
appear.
Mercolized wax dissolves away
the old, dry skin and leaves behind
a new, healthy complexion. Beauty
is but skin deep—mercolized wax
brings it to the surface. It is empha-
sised that this wax is quite harmless,
and contains only the purest ingre-
dients, being free from any poison-
ous mercury salts.
The meaning of the word “mer-
colized” is “active,” and its activity
is obtained from its oxygen content,
which is Nature’s own beautifier. As
a general facial cleanser mercolized
wax is unequalled, being in universal
everyday use by up-to-date, dis-
criminating women. Husbands also
find it beneficial for use after shav-
ing, especially if the skin is chafed.
It should always be used before the
application of powder, as the wax
will prevent the pores of the skin
from becoming clogged and un-
healthy.
All Chemists can supply you with
pure mercolized wax, in neat,
original tins, containing sufficient to
last from six to eight weeks. Price,
5/6 per tin, or post free from

Complainant "in a south suburban (Melb.)
court, asked by the Bench if she was de-
fendant’s wife, answered with complete
assurance: “Practically, your Worship.”
“Yacko”: One has heard of places of
worship that have been turned into taverns,
but South Aus. can show a tabernacle that
was once a pub. The first licensed hotel in
the State was at Yilki, Encounter Bay, and
the very room wherein whalers used to make
merry is now utilised for church services.
“Babbling Brook”: To the list of Austra-
lian women workers who lost their lives on
oversea service during the war (B. 3/4/’24)
there might be added the name of Mrs.
Costello, of Queensland. She was not a
worker under the Red Cross, but did her
bit at No. 14 A.G.H., Abbasia. She was
a very early war bride, who left Queensland
for Egypt in 1918, and contracted typhoid in
the library of the hospital—it is supposed
through handling books used by patients —
and died a few days later.
“The Deacon”: Native-born R.C. clerics
are passed over when it comes to the episco-
pate, and the Irish graduate is always a safe
bet; still, to ease down natural resentment,
an occasional sop is thrown them in the way
of a minor dignity. The latest recipient is
Eugene Brauer, a Western Suburbs (Syd-
ney) . native, who, after being Dean of the
Cardinal’s College, was recently made Rector
of St. Columba’s Missionary College, at
Springwood (N.S.W.). Rome has made him
a monsignor, which carries the right to wear
purple robes on state occasions and a purple
“dicky” for week days.
“T.P.”: “Fax’s” reference to Frank
Brophy, letter-carrier and Labor candidate
for Ballarat (B. 10/4/’24), brings to mind
Joe Kirton, who early in 1889 walked
from a similar job into Parliament. Kirton
was mournful, oracular, took life seriously,
dieted himself and tried hard to clean up
the scandal of free railway passes to mem-
bers, their wives, families, cousins, uncles
and aunts. He represented Ballarat West
with the redoubtable Dicky Yale. In due
course poor Joseph went and is forgotten;
but his mate, Bob McGregor, is still the elect
of Ballarat East.
“H.G.”: It happened in the bad old
days of N. S. Wales, when convict
prisoners were largely employed upon
farms. This one was in the Hunter
district, and the owner, a retired mili-
tary man, was sometimes forced to leave
the place in charge of his wife, whereupon
the convicts would seize the opportunity for
a general loaf. At last the old lady, unable
to do any active overseering, bought a
telescope, and announced her intention of
watching operations from the house. The
next move was with the prisoners, and it
was an effective one. They put the telescope
out of commission by stripping to the buff.
“T.R.H.” : “Hanno” complains of the in-
sufficient protection against outsiders
accorded to Australian medical men. Haven’t
Australian actors and actresses a similar
grievance? About 75 per cent, of the much
boosted. English “stars” who come here do
not arrive until they are on the wane. Not
long ago I saw an English pantomime
“principal boy”—well over 50 to my personal
knowledge— getting all the good songs and
“fat” while a young and really charming and
clever Aussie girl had to play second fiddle.
If the two had exchanged parts the panto
might have done more than just about pay
expenses. It is the same in the music-halls;
the played-out English comedian gets all the
advt. and most of the salary when he
ought to be in the Music-hall Artists’ Benevo-
lent Home.
‘H.E.R.’s” story of another reformation:
Drinkers may have been coerced into sobriety by
having their transgressions magnified (B. 10/4/’2),
but Brown, a friend of mine, leapt on to the water-
waggon because of his wife’s touching faith that he
was incapable of imbibing to excess. He stumbled
home one evening so much under the influence that
all the neighbors came out and ducked back again
to peep from behind curtains; but Mrs. Brown ran
out, full of anxiety, called him by his pet names,
engineered him inside, and finally undressed and put
him to bed, murmuring wifely sympathy. Also she
nursed him for three days until he regained normality.
The question of drink never once came up until the
next-door neighbor foolishly asked if Brown was
over his jubilee. A few minutes later Mrs. Brown
came into the bedroom. Her hair was awry, but
her face was flushed with a strange triumph. “That
woman next door had the cheek to hint you were
drunk the other night,” she explained. “But I
think she will never say such a wicked thing
again. ’ Brown choked out a “No, darling,” and
when she left the room swore off drink forever.
“Ah Poo” : Australia is faced with a grave
problem owing to the policy of buying out
experienced men who are a fine asset to the
country, to put in inexperienced men who
have to be spoonfed. There is not a sheep-
owner in Australia who does not know the
high class of the Trawalla (Vic.) sheep.
Such flocks have taken upwards of a hun-
dred years to bring to their present per-
fection ; yet the Government ruthlessly
sweeps all that valuable experience away
by one Act. Australia’s first sheep were im-
ported at the beginning of the 19th century,
and the rams would yield about 3|lb. of
wool. Now, as the result of years of scien-
tific breeding, aided by climatic conditions,
the yield of the best merino ram is up to
401 b. of wool. There, is not only the growth
in quantity; there is also the growth in
quality to be reckoned with. Such wool as
Australia produces to-day was undreamt of
a century ago. Yet the shrinkage in the
number of sheep in Australia amounts to no
less than 20,000,000 since 1891. Sheet are
practically, responsible for half the wealth
of Australia; yet Governments persist with
their asinine policy of cutting up sheep
country for wheat farms or orchards. The
wheat farmers have to take any price offer-
ing on the other side of the world for their
wheat; and now that Russia is producing
again prices will drop still more, as by
taking Russia’s wheat Britain has its only
chance of being paid a vast debt. The
orchardist is in much the same position. If
the Commonwealth would cease importing
farm laborers for a while—as if Australia
wasn’t overstocked with laborers now—and
try to induce a few of the manufacturers of
woollen goods to emigrate to Australia, with
their staff and plant, the result would be
far more satisfactory and productive of
wealth to Australia.

"I find Rexona Soap
delightful for the skin
and as a shampoo for
the hair it has no
equal.”
Miss MARCIA BUTHVKX.
Rexona Soap Gives Natural
Beauty to Skin and Hair.
That natural beauty of skin and hair which cannot he imitated can be
obtained by regular use of Rexona Skin and Facial Soap. Ordinary toilet
soaps do not assert this influence. Many of them contain free alkali, winch
tends to dry the skin and destroy its delicate texture. Even the best ot such
soaps can only cleanse; they cannot heal and protect the skin.
Rexona Soap contains the same soothing, healing, antiseptic balsams as
Rexona, the Rapid Healer, the value of which in the treatment of skin affections
is known throughout the world. Simply use Rexona Skin and
Facial Soap regularly once or twice a day and see
if it does not quickly soothe and cleanse the pores,
lessen the tendency to pimples and leave the
complexion clear, fresh and velvety.

The House of Poesy.
[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
I’D like to dwell with Poesy
In a small house alone,
Where everything should always be
Still as a mossy stone.
I'd like a little garden near
Where I should walk myself
\nd never even softly hear
A singing flower-elf.
The young Spring might come visiting
On noiseless, dewy feet.
And at my gate' the morning smg
Her carol cool and sweet.
Hushed whispers of the blue-robed night
Perhaps I’d gladly share,
While through her starry valleys white
The moon moved wise and fair.
But no one else should come at all
Within my singing gate,
Lest such disturb a leaf s brown fall,
A flower about to mate.
So could I dwell with Poesy,
Be glad for evermore —
That’s if the gods were kind to me,
And made Love live next door.

with the rest of the tribe. How quiet they
~11 were! No loud talk of the young men,
no laughing chatter of the gins, no squeals
from the piccaninnies.
His favorite hunting-dog, too, was not
sleeping by his side.
Angrily Wnrrigal sat up. Ills fierce eyes
instantly saw on the side nearest liis heart,
where his dog should have been lying, a
little round, flat stone. The Death Stone!
For long breaths Warrigal sat silently
staring in the gloom of his gunyali, a rugged
black statue, midway between beast and
man. His'brain could grasp only one thing
at a time. Some unknown enemy had
‘•pointed the bone” at him. Then the, spirits
of the dead had brought the Death Stone to
bis side by night. And now he must go
away and die.
He crawled through the gunyah-openmg
dazedly, and stood upright in the new; morn-
ing air. The birds were trilling with the
sweetness of freshly-awakened life: the big
Sun-god was peeping over the grey moun-
tain range that hid the sea.
Mechanically Warrigal grasped his spears
and womera, and started off slowly .towards
the grey range and the burial-ground of his
people. From the tribesmen clustered
motionless around the cooking fires came no
sound of farewell. Only a young gin wept
bitterly. But as Warrigal strode on with
all the litheness gone from his sinewy legs,
his mind was bitter only against his hunting
dog. It had not followed him.
When the Sun-god shone fiercely in his
domed home Warrigal came to the base of
an old grey mountain which towered far
above all else of the big, grey range. Around
him lay in confusion fallen granite boulders
often as big as the gunyalis the strange
white men build. Far away towards the
Sun-god’s world, where the big. wliite-tufted
eagle was circling, the grey boulders were
piled in numbers like the sands of the sea.
No trees, no vegetation grow on those boul-
ders or among the caverns in between. But
on the flat summit, where lies a little
loam, there cling stunted, gnarled trees,
twisted and wrenched and tossed by the
fierce winds of the sea, bent and bowed like
the forlorn crosses on lone graves of white
men.
Without hesitation Warrigal began slowly
to climb the mountain, choosing a zigzag
course which picked out the interlocking
boulders in such a way that a man could
step from one broad surface to another.
Black men had climbed the grey mountain
that way long before white men had learned
to hew a club out of stone. Warrigal never
paused, but his steps grew slower, his heart
sank lower as he climbed in the footsteps
of the ghosts that had gone before.
At last he reached the broad, flat summit,
and, never pausing, instantly concentrated
his gaze on the far-flung sea. He did not
glance at the dwarfed trees. He knew what
was there. Those hungry roots were deep
in dust, brown dust, human dust. Around
their twisted butts lay skulls, old skulls
of blackish-grey with little earth-colored
holes where air and rain and sun had bored
through. There were many brown, and
some a dirty grey-white, and others that
glistened from the kiss of the sun; these last
the eagles had picked clean, and the rainstorms
had bathed them milky-white in their crude
framework in the twisted branches. Two
were skeletons hanging downward, where
they had been blown through the branches,
fhe wind swayed them now, and they made
a curious sound as they kissed together, like
a snake rustling through dry grass. For
this was the burial-ground of his people.
Warrigal stood on the mountain-edge
gazing far out at the foam-billows playing
along the Great Barrier Reef. For the sea
was Life. And though he was soon to die
. amgal, like all things both wild and
civilised, wanted to gaze on life to the last.
He could see the squat shape of Nobel Island
hke a black toad close inshore, and far out,
over rugged Cape Melville, the tall, needle-
hke peak of the largest of the Howich
'Troup.
He climbed a little way down the moun-
tam-lip. He dared not rest on the summit.
At night all the spirits of the depd people
would play there. Warrigal shivered. He
chose a gloomy, narrow-mouthed cavern
whose rough walls were furred by the scrap-
ing past of rock wallabies. The animal
smell of this home of wild things pleased
his nostrils. He sat down with his back
to the mountain summit, staring stonily out
to sea—waiting.
I ar below him, right in the bowels of
the mountain, he could hear the splash of
running water among the piled-up boulders.
Hie lilting gurgle was the laughter of the
spirits at play, waiting for the cloak of
night to cover them on the mountain-top.
The Sun-god, sinking to sleep far behind,
drew his blanket over the world. So came
the hush hour when the live things of day
retire and those of night get ready to prey
over the earth. The wind died down until
only the spume of its breath came with the
softening boom of the rollers on the rocky
shore below. The black of the sky was
pierced with a fast-spreading net of stars
that twinkled brighter and brighter. With
a sudden, stiff catspaw came the jangle of
bones from the branches of a tree.
The black man, motionless in the cavern,
hunched his shoulders and hips so close that
his body shrank by half. His mat of coarse
hair straightened upright and stayed there.
He thrust a wrist in his open mouth to
stay the snapping of his teeth. Livid, un-
seeing eyes glared out over the vast, slow-
moving bosom of the sea. The spirits of
the dead had come out to play.
A piercing shriek rose from the summit.
Its fearful echoes rang through and through
the honeycombed caverns. Again and yet
again the laugh rang out. Then silence
spread over the world, and muffled wings
beat the air. The night hawk, sitting in the
burial trees, had called his mate for the even-
ing meal.
Late on the third day Warrigal sensed
the death spirit very near. His instinct,
razor-edged, could feel it coming closer,
closer.
Noiselessly in the playing sunlight at the
cavern’s mouth stepped lissome Wy-wee, the
young gin. Her lips were parted in the ten-
sion of breathing without noise; her big
violet-black eyes were wide with jfright.
She held tightly a freshly-killed flying
squirrel.
Long she gazed at the crouched form of
the black man, whose wild, fixed eyes stared
past her far out over the sunlit sea. Then
she knelt on the cold rock and edged up to
him, looking into his unseeing eyes, rub-
bing her forehead against his. calling softly
his name. With tender hands she brushed
his stiff, grizzled hair that was only a few
days ago so curly and black, but now a
tangle of bristles with white patches.
Beseechingly Wy-wee held the squirrel to
her man. He made no movement; he might
almost be dead.
Quickly she glided from the cavern and
ran upward towards the summit, jumping
the rocks like a wallaby. In unspeakable
terror she snatched dry sticks from beneath
the grizzly trees, trying fearfully not to
see the dead things among the dead wood.
With a cloud of black hair behind her and
a host of unnameable things snatching at
her heels, she fled down the rocks to the
cavern. Shivering violently she bent over
the sticks, rubbing two together with a
twirling motion of marvellous rapidity. Soon
they gave out the faintest breath of smoke,
then a stronger breath, then a puff’ with
warmth in it, then a quickly-increasing
spiral of hot smoke that suddenly burst into
bright flame.
She arranged the fire and laid on it the
squirrel. A smell of burning fur filled the
cavern, to drift away through the open
spaces between the rocks. As Wy-wee
turned the tiny animal on the blazing coals
an appetising odor of roast meat mingled
with the incoming sea breeze. The cooking
completed, she invited Warrigal to the rneat.
But he sat like a thing of black stone'. Tear-
ing off a hind leg she pressed the warm flesh
between her man’s lips. It met only a
flashing line of set teeth.
Throwing the animal from her she sobbed
on the chest of the doomed man.
The following noon three black shadows
fell across the mouth of the cavern. Two
of them, charm-painted, seized Wy-wee and
dragged her screaming from the motionless
Warrigal. Eurahah, the dreaded wizard
doctor of the tribe, stood a long silent
moment, gazing with snake-like eyes into the
wild eyes of Warrigal. now fixed with the
stare that comes just before the death-film.
And Eurahah, who was very old and had
many wives and was yet not satisfied,
grinned evilly as he glided from the cavern.

[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
MRS. CLEGHORN’S Uncle was doing
14 days’ hard labor for Denny
Deneen. He scrubbed floors,
cleaned boots, played scullion and carried
the pig-bucket—which is not a bucket of
pigs, but the vehicle of their refection.
When scrubbing he gripped the brush des-
perately and low down as if it were his only
protection from drowning in the suds, and
used vile language. Mostly he spoke under
his breath, because Nemesis, in the form of
Denny, was ever imminent —Denny, smok-
ing at. his ease and extracting pleasure from
his victim’s pain. Now the dreaded voice of
the commercial magnate of Quart Pot smote
his ears again.
“There you are! Down on your knees and
groanin’ as if there was more wather in the
knees than in the bucket. Sayin’ y’r pray-
ers, are you? Wit’ your slicrub-brush held
in your little hand an’ the hatred of all good
min in your little heart, burstin’ wit’ rage
and shpite! Shcrub, you divil, shcrub, or
the sargint will be takin’ you to the Bashteel
ag’in. An’ let me tell you you won’t get
out of there in a great whoile this time, be-
cause he wants his garden dug and his chook-
houses white-washed, an’ he’d kape you there
best part of a mont’ doin’ the jobs he have
for you. Aye, groan, me little loafer, in the
tribulation and confusion of your dishtracted
moind.” ,
“O my Gawd!” moaned uncle.
“Prayin’, are you? What would you
pray to? A Choinyman will pray to his
joss an’ burn a shtick an’ beat the gong to
kape his joss’s moind on his work; but
Choinymin do be good min an’ grreat workin’
min, growin’ the shpuds an’ the pumpins
and the cabbage, an’ the parshnips early
and late, an’ the beetroot and rhubab in
their sayson, too. But you wouldn’t have
a joss. Divil' the shtick would you buy to
burn for the best joss betune Ingham and
T'ursday Island, then. You’re not prayin’:
an’ why do you make noises like shupplica-
tion ?”

Never Neglect a Wound or Sore!
Promptly Apply Antiseptic ZAM-BUK.
YOU hear of limbs being crippled and even lives lost through
neglect of a simple cut or tiny scratch—trivial wounds and
injuries which simply needed prompt attention.
When you or your children sustain a cut, burn, scald or bruise,
prevent infection by quickly dressing the injury with antiseptic
Zam-Buk, otherwise disease-germs are likely to infect the damaged
tissues and set up blood-poison.
Zam-Buk is the discovery which has
revolutionised the treatment of all skin
troubles. Zam-Buk has antiseptic powers
which quickly purify a wound and kill as
well as exclude disease germs, and so pre-
vent festering and blood-poisoning. At the
same time Zam-Buk’s powerful herbal
essences induce a natural healing process
which quickly knits the severed parts to-
gether by growing healthy, new tissue.
For the treatment of cuts, burns and
scalds, eczema, ulcers, sore feet, abscesses,
ringworm, and poisoned wounds, Zam-Buk
should be kept handy in every home.
“When on a river up the North Coast,”
says Mr. J. Nicholson, 25 Edward Street,
Redfern, Sydney, “I had my hand pierced
by a noxious weed which stuck nearly half-
way through and caused a very painful
wound; so excessive was the agony that I
nearly fainted. Knowing the ever-present
dangers of lockjaw and blood-poison from
such injuries, I promptly applied Zam-Buk.
This grand healer quickly drew all the
poison out, subdued the inflammation
and healed up the injury rapidly and
thoroughly.”

( I got a splinter in me hand.”
. , Moind you’re not med to pay for Idamag-
m me verandy, tearin’ it up wit’ your hands,
then.”
Uncle groaned again.
“Aren’t you liappy?” demanded Denny.
Didn t I pay your flne an’ bring you here
an thry to make you a man before you die,
so s people would respect you an’ go to your
funtheral?”
“Yes, y’ did, Mister Deneen; but ain’t I
near worked it off?”
“Y’ have; and what d’ye want to do then?”
I want a ’oliday.”
“A holiday! Isn’t life all holiday, then?”
I want to go away for a trip.”
A thrip! Go an’ have a thrip. Walk
down be the crik there anny night an’ you
can thrip over a cow in the dark. An’ if
that won’ do, do y’ see that big slitone
there ? He pointed to the highest of the
great r ocks spilled on the summit of the
high hill to the west of the township.
“Yes.”
. “As socßi as you have finished wit’ the
pigs go yc'u up there an’ thrip over that.
’Twill cost you nothin’, ’cept your life, an’
that’s nothin’. Thrips you want! —an’ you
wit’out enough money to cross the road if
return tickets' to Brisbane were t’ree ha’-
pence each! .Thrip! Get you to your
worrk. There’s no place in the worrld for
a loafer, an’ that’s what a tourisht wit’out
money is—a loafer wit’ the exhpensive
tashtes of a king and a bookmaker, an’
them do be loafers' too. Look you out there,
be the chookyard, an’ there’s me dog Pat
that do his worrk an’ niver a tashkmashter
to dhrive him to -Jit. Whin the chooks get
out uv the yard ia to the shtable, ’atin’ out
o’ the mangers an’ I foulin’ the good chaff, do
I go to that dog an’ say to him, ‘Pat, you
loafer, moind the chooks!’ Do I, then?”
“No, Mister Dcnden.”
“No, I don’t. But about every half-hour
that dog go round 1 to see if the chooks are
behavin’ themselve.?, an’, whin he finds them
in the shtable don ? t he worrk them chooks
back into the yard Kike sheep, an’ not hurtin’
a feather of thim—not even little shuckin’
fowls a day out, but just shusssssssliing
them back to their bit of a house, wit’
the broody mother goin’ mad and thryin’ to
scratch the eyes out' ; of his head? That’s
what a dog can do—shtick to his job wit’-
out a tashkmashter beadin’ him wit’ a shwitch
behind the back.”
“But I ain’t a dog, Mister Deneen!”
“Thrue for you, an’ God bless you for
the grashious ways you learned at Buck’n’am
Pallis. Maybe you’re not a dog. Niver
did I see a dog thryin’ harnessin’ a horse in
the plough-handles an’ getting the braces
kicked off him. An’ niver did a dog get
dhrunk an’ currse the majisty of the law,
with the Jaypee unbewknownst to him; an’
niver a dog was fined wan poun’ an’ pre-
tended to worrk it out in shcrubbin’ floors
an’ chazzyin’ wit’ the pig bucket. Arrrrh,
I give you up! . Finish whin you like; but
go. A bit more uv your exhample an’ the
sun will shtand shtock shtill, an’ water will
get tired uv runnin’ down-hill. Go you
now! Lave the bucket where it is an’ get
out. Insultin’ me good little blue dog Pat
wit’ the long tail an’ one eye! Get you
gone! An’ here’s two shillin’. Get you
gone!”
At the gift of money Uncle left the bucket
where it was, pocketed the coin so insult-
ingly tendered, and began to talk with all
the dignity of the new rich.
“Thank yer, Mister Deneen. But if you
knoo hall! It ain’t me fault—l wasn’t
brung up to work, ’cept on me uncle’s farm.”
“That was whin he reaped a forrty-bushel
crop off the lorruns at Buck’n’am Pallis,
was it then? Shpare me your farrmin’ in
London, will you, me poor lazy man? What
did you do in Brisb’n’ before you come here?”
“I used to work at the Dutch hockshuns,
biddin’ against the blokes that was buyin’.”
“Dutch ’ockshuns! That’s where they
shtart bids at foive pound an’ then sell to
you for t’ree an’ shixpence, is it?”
“That’s it. I useter stand near the hock-
shineer, lookin’ very quite and respectable,
an’ when the biddin’ stopped I’d buy—an’
they’d give me the money back to buy again.”
“A good honest way uv thievin’! An’ did
you do anny good at that?”
“Didn’ I? Many a time I’d come down
without a copper an’ go ’ome with three
shillin’s an’ a pocketful o’ cigars, an’ plenty
beer, an’ carryin’ ’ome faggits, an’ pickle
onions an’ mutton-trotters.”
“God help you!” said Denny. “Get you
away or the south wind will catch your lazy
fit an’ shtop blowin’.”
Denny himself lifted the bucket and went
through the hotel. Uncle, astounded by his
tremendous luck, hurried to his little lean-
to by the lamp-room, packed his wardrobe—
not embarrassingly large^—in a cabin-trunk
made of a 701 b. sugar-bag, and ran to the
front of the hotel to resume his duties at
the bar —interrupted but 16 days ago by
the sergeant and his little prison.
“A long beer!” gasped the reprieved one,
and seized the glass before it could struggle.
Denny Denejen looked in. “At it ag’in!”
said he. “At it ag’in, are you? Hand to
mout’—hand to mout’! An’ don’t care whose
hand it is so long as it is your mout’! You’ll
be hanged yet.”
Uncle gulped the beer and fled from Bil-
dad, the gloomy prophet. Then did Denny,
seeing his late employee proceeding leisurely
up the winding street, send swiftly a mes-
senger to the sergeant by the straight track
through the paddocks.
Thus, half an hour later, when Uncle
reached the wayside, hotel by the upper settle-
ment, where he might spend his substance
free of Bildadism, he saw a lion in the path
—a sergeant-lion dressed in khaki.
“Hullo, Uncle!” said the khaki lion cheer-
fully. “How’s the game?”
“What gyme, sir?”
“Your game, whatever it is. Anything
from pitch-and-toss to manslaughter.”
“I never did,” said Uncle indignantly, won-
dering what new charges had been trumped
up against him.
“Left your job?”
“I was sacked.”
“Is that so? Well, I’ve got another for
you, and if you’re a genuine unemployed
you’ll take it.”
“Is it hard?”
“It isn’t hard ; it’s soft. And you needn’t
soil your hands—it’s just limewashing. Nice
white limewash and a nice brush; splodgin’,
that’s it. Just about take you the rest of
the day, and I’ll give you half a crown and
two meals be better than bein’
vagged.”
The argument being all in the tail of the
remark, Uncle accepted. He could imagine
the limewashing of the fowlhouses—crouching
under the low roofs, limewash falling into his
eyes, his fingers aching with the weight of
the brush, his back cramped by bending;
but anything was better than further en-
counter with the law.
“They took the blackfeller’s land, but they
don’t myke him work. I never had no
land, but if I don’t work they get me for
fragrancy,” he whined.
“Good enough!” said the sergeant. “Make
a good job of it, and I’ll get you constant
work,” he added hastily, seeing the objec-
tion in Uncle’s eyes—“a lasting job, that
is, with not much to do and good pay.”
“That ’d do me,” replied Uncle, but with-
out gratitude. “Where’s the limewash ?”
The sergeant led him to the fowlhouses by
the police horse-paddock, and Uncle plucked
new hope from the discovery that the lime-
wash was already prepared.
“Y’ had it all ready for me, sergeant,
llow d’ya know I was cornin’ this way?”
“I didn’t have it ready for you partieu-
larly. The job wants doing, and I thought
I might get hold of somebody to-day.”
“Get hold—you mean?”
“I mean, run ’im in till the job’s done,
But I just’s soon pay you.”
As Uncle seized the bucket and brush and
made for the fowlhouses he broke into a
sweat much colder than that promised to
the sons of Adam to eat their bread in.
The sergeant, having work to be done, and
failing labor in the open market, would have
arrested any vagrom man to do the job. The
terrible people in the world!
“Czars! Despocks! That’s what they
are. Tyrinks! Slave-drivers—that’s what
they are!” said Uncle, using the brush with-
out ease, delicacy or precision.
* * * *
The sergeant, donning his official hat, went
out into the road to stop Denny Deneen
as he rode to the upper settlement.
“Did that divil of energy come to you,
sergeant?”
“Yes. I put him on to the whitewashing.”
“And are you payin’ him good Comm’n-
wealt' coin, then?”
“Yes. I couldn’t vag him till he’s refused
a job. And there’s a job for us, Mister
Deneen.”
“What’s that, sargint?”
“Inquest. Joe the Bellman died last night,
I’ve sent for the doctor, but he won’t be
ready with the post-mortem till late. In-
quest in the courthouse at five this after-
noon—do?”
“YeS. Why’s the post-mortem? Was it
sudden, then?”
“Yes. He was all right last night. They
want a bellman for to-night, too. There’s
the pictures and a political meeting. What
about Uncle for bellman?”
“Why not? But will he do anny work
for more than two minutes by a fasht clock?”
“It isn’t work. And if it is, it looks like
loafing.” .
“At anny rate it will be savin’ a good man
from it. Well, it’s only sprruikin’ an’ r’arin’
‘T’night! T’night!’ an’ maybe lie’s a good
actor because he’s a damn loafer. An’ I’ll
be coroner for ould Joe at foive.”
In the dusk, Denny Deneen having directed
a verdict of death from natural causes in
the inquest on Joe the Bellman, the sergeant
and the doctor drank their whisky in Denny’s
hotel-parlor.
“I app’inted Uncle, Mister Deneen,” said
the sergeant. He worked this time—lime-
washed all the fowlhouses, and the ground,
and himself too. Roofs looked a bit streaky,
but that won’t matter.”
“Looked streaky, did they? I’ll bet Uncle
didn’t use the brush. He just t’rew a bucket
of limewash on each roof and let it run and
got himself covered that way. Lishten!”
Without, a Cockney voice and the moon
came to earth at the same moment.
“Lishten!” said Denny again.
A bell—father of all the cracked bullock
bells that be; a bell making the night ugly
—and then the voice crying in the wilderness
and mixing up the political meeting and the
pictures.
“Ter-night! Ter-night! Ter-night! Mary
Pickfood and Gillyan Pish. Picshurs Ter-
night ! Ter-night! Ter-night! P’lit’cal meet-
in’ ! The Honble Bisher Flip an’ Rober’
Barnes. Ter-night! Ter-night!”
“Uncle!”
“Yes,” said Denny Deneen, “an’ loafin’ on
the job, an’ couldn’ help it. There he is,
mixin’ up politicians an’ Bishops talkin’
for pro’bition. Bisher Flip an’ Rober’
Barnes. God help you! He would get the
town arrested for crimin’l libel if a township
could be arrested. But Quart Pot’s safe.”
“Gillyan Pish an’ Rober’ Flip! Bisher
Pickfood an’ Mary Barnes! Ter-night!
Ter-night! Ter-night!”
“Grayvious bod’ly harm on the English
language,” said Denny. “Lishten! Why
have he shtopped? Is he waitin’ for us to
angkore him?”
They heard Uncle’s heavy bluchers on the
verandah; the noise dwindled in the direc-
tion of the bar.
Denny Deneen opened the parlor door and
looked in to the bar-room. And there he
saw Uncle the artist resting from his labors,
and therefore drinking beer.
“Hand to mout’,” said Denny, “hand to
mout’.”
So it was in more ways than one. Having
disbursed the reward of virtue dealing with
whitewash, Uncle wiped his mouth, took up
his cracked bell, and sought the street again.
“Ter-night! Ter-night! Mary Pickfood.’’
“And where at, you misfortunate poor
dunkey?” said ,Denny Deneen. “Where at?
Say you ‘To-night, to-night, with Mary Pick-
ford at Deneen’s Hall!’ ”
“Gord ’elpus,” said Uncle. “Orright. Ter-
night ! Ter-night at Deneen’s ’all. Mary
Pickfood. Ter-night! Ter-night!”
So with hand to mouth the artist who had
found himself at last roared to the risen
moon.
“Ter-night! Ter-night! Ter-night! Pick-
food. Fish, Barnes and Flip. Ter-night!
Ter-night! Ter-niglit!”
Beer, the sub-editor, had used his blue
pencil. Roaring his revised version Uncle
went upon his way.

Wet-proof Shotgun Cartridges
Factory Loaded.
VICTORIAN PIGEON CHAMPIONSHIP.
At the Melbourne Gun Club’s Grounds, Brighton, Vic., on the 7th
March, “Rowsley,” using REMINGTON UMC “ARROW” grade shotgun
cartridges, won the above championship, killing 20 out of 21 birds from
the 30-yard mark. C. B. Meadway, using REMINGTON UMC “NITRO
CIAJBS,” from the same mark, tied for second place, killing 19 out of 21
birds.
Cartridges have long been made of so-called “waterproof” paper, but our
exclusive process is distinctly different. All REMINGTON UMC cases are
thoroughly “wetproofed”— top wad, crimp and body; and are the only loaded shells
on the market positively sealed against wet. Smokeless powder necessarily contains
a certain amount of moisture. REMINGTON UMC “wetproofing” seals in this
moisture, thus preventing the powder from drying out or deteriorating.
In case of difficulty in procuring these high-grade factory-loaded shells, either
for Field or Trap shooting, please refer to the Australian Representative.

Good health, no doubt, is often a heritage, but \
it is just as often a matter of cultivation.
Many healthy families have not been endowed
with exceptionally strong constitutions and the fact that
their members keep remarkably free from disease and
live to a good old age is largely due to the sensible way
in which they attend to questions of health.
They keep their digestive organs in good order. Any |
sign of stomach trouble or constipation is immediately =
dealt with by means of the World’s Family Medicine. i
Keep a box of Beecham’s Pills in the house and =
make use of them whenever your health or that of any =
member of the family needs attention.
