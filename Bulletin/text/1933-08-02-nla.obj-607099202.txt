HIS
BOOKS
Is This England?
* From time to time our Customs ban
classics like Huxley’s “Brave New
World.” The principle seems to be that
a book is only morally dangerous when
it is constructive or critical as well as
plain-spoken. Modern novels or plays
which -depict the new hedonism are
passed, irrespective of the behavior and
language of the characters, provided they
take degeneration for granted. In con-
sequence, thousands of Australians are
given a one-sided idea of social develop-
ments on the other side of the world.
They are allowed to see England’s rot-
tenness, but are debarred from seeing
how English writers of genius are react-
ing to it.
The three books dealt with this week
give descriptions which are no doubt
accurate enough of the way some
rich English people live. Any of them
may be studied by future generations
who wish to know something of fashion-
able fife at the heart of the Empire in
1933. But future generations will be able
to turn from the bane to the antidote,
from writers who merely record to those
who record and interpret; which is where
they will have a big pull over us.
Wasters
Maurice Richardson’s My Bones Will
Keep (Collins; 7s. 6d.) is one of those
plain tales from the sewers which are
to be found by the dozen in most good
bookshops. It is the story of a public
school and Oxford product from infancy
to early manhood. About a third deals
with Thomas Swayne’s schooldays, which
were no different from those of boys in
a score of novels, such as “The Loom of
Youth.” He has just gone up to Oxford
when the 1926 strike begins. He leaves
for London “to play at dock-laboring.”
In a shabby night club he meets “a dull,
stupid woman, quite flat and dead, no
character,” who presses her cheek against
his while dancing. “This ought to be
easy,” he thinks. It is. His next love
is Nancy, the sister of an alcoholic
friend. He and Nancy get the friend
drunk and spend the night together.
Shortly afterwards Nancy’s engagement
is announced in the “Times.” She writes
to say that it won’t make any difference
to their relations, but he is annoyed, and
begins an affair with Evelyn, an Ameri-
can.
And now he meets Joe, a dipso-
maniac, and takes definitely to drink him
self. Joe is the best-drawn character in
the book ; a well-bred young drunk with
a passion for the gutter and a strong
sense of the humor of fantastic phrases.
An appreciation of the comedy of cer-
tain words, as words, is a literary quality
which is often found in English youths
of Joe’s type. Joe certainly lives.
Thomas’s next affair is with Elizabeth,
a Jewess, who wants him to marry her.
He no more cares for her than he did
for the others—his feelings for women
are a blend of lust and boredom; Joe
is the only person he is really happy
with —yet he is on the point of marrying
her when he is ordered home by tele-
gram. His father has found out about
some money he has stolen, and he is
“sent to the colonies in disgrace.” The
author doesn’t attempt to explain
Thomas; merely puts him forward as
one who he is clearly satisfied will be
recognised.
Puritanism Debunked
Smite and Spare Not, by Lance Sievek-
ing (Cassell; 7s. 6d.), is a far worthier
effort than the other as regards tech-
nique ; the dust-jacket by Paul Nash is
a measure of the artistry of much of the
writing. The theme is the folly of Puri-
tanism.
Quentin Mandrake is censorious.
He suspects his friends of all kinds
of sins. The war comes, and he is shell-
shocked. In a series of moving and im-
aginative chapters the unfortunate lad is
shown storming about unregenerate Eng-
land, on the wings of his delusion, as
Cromwell. Vice
is ruthlessly
stamped out.
Then he recovers
and gets engaged
to Naomi, whom
he had suspected
in his puritanical days of trying to seduce
him. As they sit together in a smart
restaurant he thinks about her.
A virgin until the other day—he did not ask.
Rather, with a shake of himself —he hoped
not. After all these years—poor darling. Her
own affair —unless she chose to tell him.
One Tuft, whose habits had revolted him
at Cambridge, trips over to their table.
As Tuft departs, Quentin smiles: “Those
chaps are quaint, aren’t they? They
have a language all their own. Some
people dislike them frightfully—but I
don’t know.” He is like that about
everyone and everything; all his old
moral standards have vanished with his
personal inhibitions. He is completely
sane at last.
Bright Young Men
Noel Coward is said by his admirers
to be England’s most civilised citizen.
No dislikes except of cant and stupid-
ity ; no prejudices, ethical or racial; a
cosmopolitan. “Cavalcade” caused him
to be condemned in some quarters as an
Empire mhn, but his friends didn’t worry.
They could read between the flag-wav-
ings of his box-office triumph the scorn
that he feels for patriots. His latest play,
Design for Living (Heinemann ; 65.), is a
reversion to his early manner ; a registra-
tion of amused disbelief in the desire or
capacity of the only kind of young Eng-
lishmen he knows well to save England
according to the Marryot formula.
Gilda is living in Paris with Otto.
While he is away, Leo, his friend, arrives
unexpectedly, and she and Leo spend
the night together. Otto finds out and
leaves in a huff, and she goes to live
with Leo in London. One day Otto
arrives unexpectedly while Leo is out,
whereupon she betrays Leo with Otto.
Then she marries Ernest, and Leo and
Otto go off to live together, well pleased
on the whole. Two years pass, and Leo
and Otto arrive at Ernest’s New York
flat. Next day Gilda tells her husband
she is going away to live with Leo and
Otto ; that if she doesn’t her “heart will
be heavy and sick and lonely for them”
till she dies.
Leo: “J knew it. I knew it last night”
Otto: “We both knew it! We laughed our-
selves to sleep.”
The curtain falls on Gilda, Leo and Otto,
helpless with laughter at the indignation
of Ernest. Most of the wit consists of
Wheeler-and-Woolsey wise cracks done
into English. Of course, there is a drunk
scene:—
Otto {handing Leo his glass'): “Now what?”
Leo: “Now what what?”
Otto ( giggling slightly): “Don’t keep say-
mg what, what, what —it sounds ridiculous.”
A note on the cover says the play “is
scoring a great success in America.” It
would. Leo and Otto are Englishmen
who appeal immensely to foreigners.

Critics’ Critics
A sentence in a review of two books
by doctors (R.P. 5/7/’33), “It is remark-
able that only one great figure in English
literature has been a doctor,” brought
the critics’ critics out in droves. They
nearly all took some argument that
hadn’t been used and demolished it.
One objector supported his case by
smarting a passage “Not only in English
literature,” and going on to quote such
illustrious French or German and Russian
doctor-writers as Rabelais, Schiller and
Tchekhoff. The same authority bracketed
Max Mordau with Sir Frederick Treves.
The favorite tactic was to put arbitrary
interpretations on the term “great figure
in English literature.” This enabled
scientific writers such as Oliver Lodge
and Havelock Ellis to be quoted, and a
host of poets, novelists and dramatists.
One list contained the names of “Thomas
Lodge, Thomas Campion and Arthur
Johnson in the sixteenth century ; Henry
Vaughan, Abraham Cowley and William
Chamberlayne in the seventeenth cen-
tury ; John Arbuthnot, Bernard Mande-
ville and John Byron in the eighteenth

century,” and such nineteenth- and twen-
tieth-century celebrities as “W. H. Drum-
mond, the Canadian poet,” and ‘ John
McCrae, who wrote the exquisite war
poem ‘ln Flanders Fields’.” Also Dr.
Miller (“author of ‘A Night Out,’ ‘Marry
the Girl’ and numerous other plays and
sketches”) and Harold Dearden, “best
known by ‘lnterference,’ which he wrote
with Roland Pertwee.”
Worthy practitioners, no doubt, both
in writing and in doctoring, but emphati-
cally not great figures in English litera-
ture.
The names of Keats, Goldsmith and
Smollett appeared on all the lists. These
men are indeed “great figures in English
literature,” and the number of doctors
who believe the popular legend that they
were doctors is amazing. Keats was
apprenticed to a surgeon at Edmonton, in
1810, when he was 15, but he never took
a doctor’s degree or practised. Smollett
was also apprenticed to a surgeon, and,
“when reduced almost to starvation, he
was fain to take the situation of sur-
geon’s mate on board a ship of the line.”
He “soon quitted the Navy in disgust,”
and maintained himself for the rest of
his life by writing. Goldsmith’s only
claim to the title of doctor was founded
on his unsupported statement that he had
been given a doctor’s degree by the Uni-
versity of Padua. Research has failed to
reveal any verification of his boast, and
he was a notorious romancer. He cer-
tainly studied medicine for a while at
Edinburgh ; but “he left that celebrated
university,” says a biographer, “the third
university at which he had resided, in his
27th year, without a degree.”

Roosevelt and the Future
When one knows that Franklin D.
Roosevelt’s Looking Forward (Heine-
mann ; 7s. 6d.) is composed of articles
and speeches prepared before he became
President of the United States, it is easier
to forgive both his apparent simple
trust in human nature and his salesman-
like literary style. Candidates who do
not openly and eagerly credit mankind
with Olympian ideals and selfless aspira-
tions rarely become presidents ; and the
art of imparting a fine literary flavor to
election publicity waned with Canning
and died with Lincoln.
Unfortunately for the reputation of
the distinguished author and of his
schemes, history had already begun to
screen the scenario of his plan before
the world had time to read about it in
this book. As always happens, the pic-
ture is very different from the written
story. While the President-elect believed
that the “rulers of mankind’s goods have
failed through their own stubbornness
and incompetence.... and have abdi-
cated,” they appear to be cumbering the
earth in hordes to the great embarrass-
ment of the President de facto. And a
very rough passage they are giving the
dishevelled hero as he rides among the
high-souled but grasping populace on his
way to “restore the temple to the ancient
truths.” None of his constituents, indeed,
seems to be impressed with his theory
(which seems oddly familiar) that
“happiness does not lie in the possession
of money.” The technique of avarice is
being strained every day to convert his
visions to the purposes of the specu-
lators.
It sounds easy to double the value of
all goods by halving the gold in the
dollar, to abolish unemployment by
shortening hours, to make farming profit-
able by wiping out unpayable farms, to
minimise crime and hasten its punish-
ment by sweeping judicial reforms, and
to end duplication as between the govern-
ments of the nation, the States and the
cities. But in the path of the innovator
of modern times always stand the oppor-
tunist and the vested interest.
The President’s book is interesting as a
revelation of the sort of dreamy com-
munism which democracies will swallow
in times of economic stress. It is un-
likely to improve his reputation with
posterity as a statesman or as a writer.
M.E.
Let’s Grow Up
Australia has had the misfortune to
reach adolescence at a time when the
world was growing self-conscious.
Adolescence is largely self-conscious-
ness, which in individuals is modified
and held in check by the superior
balance of grown-upness in those with
whom the adolescent comes in con-
tact. There is little grown-upness in
the world to-day, and so there is little
superior balance to steady an adolescent
country. The good old doctrine of “spare
the rod and spoil the child” has been
overruled by the Ethel Mannins and
Bertrand Russells of society, and though
the child now keeps his dignity intact
and his trouser buttons inviolate, it is
doubtful whether his ultimate benefit is
secured.
Self-consciousness in the individual or
country must be overcome before intel-
ligent manhood and nationhood can be
attained. Just as a child “shows off” in
front of its elders, so Australia shows
off before the older nations. It knows
it possesses droughts, kangaroos and
bushfires, and in its books and movies
—its works of the imagination—it
parades these things. It forgets that
elusive substance atmosphere, but daubs
the local color with a slapstick.
As the loutish adolescent resents
adverse criticism, so does Australia re-
sent it. A few weeks ago a Red Page
writer referred incredulously to the fact
that D. H. Lawrence’s “Kangaroo” was
taken in England as a true picture of
this country. It is a true picture. No-
thing written by Lawrence in “Kan-
garoo,” except an unfortunate reference
to God’s own country, is untrue ; no-
thing is even exaggerated. Lawrence
didn’t like Australia. It is improbable
that Lawrence or any man with at least
a streak of that wild-fire genius in his
make-up would like any country, but
he wrote unselfconsciously of it, and the
specifically Australian portions of “Kan-
garoo” make truer reading than any book
by an Australian that it has been my lot
to discover.
Let us forget that Australia possesses,
or did once possess, bushrangers, buck-
jumpers and bandicoots (Russian novel-
ists don’t splatter their pages with the
mammoth, no* Provenqals with the ele-
phants which Hannibal wafted across
from Spain) and tell our stories for their
own sake. Fiction is the representation
through print of the reaction of certain
people to certain circumstances. There
must be a relevant background, an atmo-
sphere, but for it it to overwhelm the
subject matter proper is thoroughly bad
art. Louis Stone’s “Jonah” is one of
the best —Australian —examples of a
book which has atmosphere and little
local color. I read it years ago, and
have forgotten the name of the Sydney
street in which the heroine lived, but I
can see the gutter and the back yards in
that street, the children playing there,
and hear a voice singing “White Wings
that Never Grow Weary” to this day. I
have forgotten on which particular ferry
Jonah and his illicit lady-love fared in
search of romance, but I can feel the
breeze on the water and see the sun-
shine still. There must be many Sydney-
ites who, when they see a bootshop, a
slum street or a ferryboat, think of
Jonah, “a character in a book.” Per-
haps there are some residents of the
South Coast who, like myself, think of
“Kangaroo” when they look around
them.

From a freelance:
The casualness of the commencing freelance
(Henry Bateson, R.P. 12/7/ ’33) is not restricted
to his use of shock tactics. He shows it far
more in neglecting to make a systematic attempt
to discover his forte. He should try his hand
at everything, from pars to short stories. Even
then he can only tell by the number of accept-
ances where his strength lies. The next thing js
to submit his wares to as many markets as pos-
sible ; otherwise he may continue getting rejec-
tion slips for MSS. that would be taken in a
quarter he hasn’t tried.
Money spent by the freelance in posting
rejected MSS. to other offices is well spent; for
with it he buys —and buys cheaply—knowledge
of his own forte, and of the subtle differences
in the requirements of editors.
From a sub-editor:
For nearly ten years I have had to peruse
offerings for a weekly newspaper. During
all that time I have received but two or three
efforts which were of such a quality that they
didn’t require anguished attention. Sometimes,
fearing that I might be applying too lofty a
standard and be denying expression to genius
unrecognised, I have sent submitted stories,
articles and drawings to the High Command;
but invariably its judgment confirmed my own.
I have long pondered over this, and I have
at last come to the conclusion that the average
freelance prepares himself for his job by inten-
sive study of the journal to which he wishes
to contribute. In fact, some freelances never
seem to have read anything else. This results
in a dead level of mediocrity. If a painter
spends his time looking at other people’s pic-
tures instead of at life —as, indeed, many of
them do —the result will be the same.
If I were again a freelance I would write
only what I liked writing. I would try to define
my impressions of the contemporary scene, and
I would be my own critic first. Most of my
stuff would doubtless awaken horror in editors
and end in the w.p.b., but some of it might not,
for most editors prefer their papers to be inter-
esting. The freelance who works on these lines
may not see much of his output in print but
he will develop himself. Always provided he
evades starvation.

A Satchel of Books
The Lovely Lady, by D. H. Lawrence
(Seeker ; Robertson and Mullens ; 7s. 6d.).
Of this posthumous collection only
“Mother and Daughter” approaches Law-
rence’s best, but his capacity for endow-
ing inanimate things with an uncanny
life of their own is present in “The Man
Who Loved Islands.”
This year’s summer number of
“Punch” is exceptionally strong in illus-
trations. There are 40-odd pages of
them, 16 of which are in color. “Fou-
gasse” (whose caravanning item is a gem).
Lewis Baumer, George Morrow and
Ernest Shepard are among the many
famous British artists whose work figures
in this elaborate shilling issue.
Keith Winter’s The Rats of Norway,
which has been published by Heinemann
as a play at 3s. 6d., reads more con-
vincingly in its new form than it did as
a novel. Yet the whole of the action
takes place indoors ; Jane and Sebastian
only talk about their woodland love-
making. Sebastian ends his deplorable
career, as in the book, by dying in Jane’s
bedroom, and the last curtain falls on
a scene of Slavonic misery. It was an
ingenious idea on the part of Mr. Winter
to stage all this anguish against the futile
background of a provincial preparatory
school ; the contrast greatly intensifies
the horrors.
Lady Help, by Sigrid 800 (Heinemann;
7s. 6d.), is an astute study of a Scan-
dinavian Bright Young Thing who-is, in
point of fact, identical with any British
B.Y.T. Or it may be that Naomi
Walford’s colloquial-English translation
makes Helga, the heroine, appear more
English than her creator intended. It all
began when fascinating Jorgen Krogh
bet Helga a diamond ring that she
couldn’t hold down a domestic job for a
year on her merits. Of course she did,
and of course another man won her.
Brightly written, and full of nice people.
Pound Foolish, by Renee Shann (Col-
lins; 7s. 6d.), opens with disaster in the
pleasant suburban home of Henry Sey-
mour, business manager. He is given the
sack by letter. His pretty wife wins £lOO
in a chocolate slogan competition, gets a
£5OO-a-year job, and is made love to by
her American boss in a thoroughly “nice”
way. A boss in a million. Henry also
wins a job and the love of his boss,
naughty Sara Mumford. The young
people are almost parted, but all ends
satisfactorily. The principals are a little
too good to be true, but it’s an entertain-
ing yarn for all that.
The Australian and New Zealand Ski
Year Book for 1933 is bigger and better
than ever. It has over 300 pages of
articles and paragraphs about the snow
countries of Australia and Maoriland,
many excellent photographs and deco-
rations, and—by no means an unin-
teresting feature —30 pages of advts.
Percy Hunter, the editor, hasn’t put his
signature to anything, but his associate,
Stewart Jamieson, is represented by the
introduction to his projected “History of
Australian Ski-ing” and a couple of short
articles. Other well-known ski-ers who
contribute are V. G. Wesche, C. M. E.
Gifford and T. W. Mitchell, of M.L.
The Story of Sydney, by C. H. Bertie
(Shakspeare Head Press ; 25.), tells how
Phillip’s camp on Sydney Cove has de-
veloped through 145 years into its pre-
sent bloated proportions. It is possible
to walk with Bertie along George or
Pitt street, between Circular Quay and
Central Station, and learn from his
lips what sort of building has stood
in any particular spot ever since a
gum-tree or a bottle-brush grew there;
who the successive owners have been,
and what sort of people they were: his
knowledge of the city is almost un-
canny. No one living knows so much
about Sydney, and it is doubtful whether
any of those dead men and women who
made the place possessed quite so much
knowledge of it, even in their own time.
He is never inaccurate, and this book,
though necessarily limited in its scope, is
characteristic of him.
Pacific Peril (Wynyard Book Arcade;
2s. 6d.) is by E. George Marks, of Syd-
ney. He regards Japan as the Germany
of the Pacific, and a Japanese-American
war as inevitable.
Japan’s navy is more efficient now than at
the battle of Tsu-shima, notwithstanding the
scrapping of battleships in accordance with the
Washington Agreement; her army is the most
formidable in the world —not excluding that of
France.
He concludes that if there is war in the
Pacific it will be difficult, not to say im-
possible, for Australia to remain neutral.
Always assuming it is navally and mili-
tarily so weak that it may be bluffed into
participation by one of the combatants.
The remedy is for the Commonwealth
to put its defences in order without delay.
The author, who as his admirers know
has been a close student of war for up-
wards of quarter of a century, produces
a mass of documentary evidence in sup-
port of his theories.

THE GOLD-PASS RACKET.
Side by side with the question of how
the cliques already formed to divide con-
trol of the new N.S.W. Leg. Council will
fare at the election of the 60 members
stands that other query, so important
to the 58 or more persons who will be
passed out: “Shall we keep our gold
passes?” If public opinion were con-
sulted, the answer would be “No.”
In a sense, public opinion was con-
sulted at the referendum. One of the
Ministers, Drummond, went about the
country declaring that a reformed Leg.
Council would cost less, since members
who failed of election would cease to
travel free on the Government railways
and tramways. It was assumed that he
spoke with authority ; certainly none of
his colleagues publicly contradicted him.
But as soon as the people had declared
for a House of 60 members, it began
to be whispered that the not-wanted
brigade would still be privileged to travel
on the nod, at least for periods corres-
ponding to their length of service.
It is pleaded that retention of the gold
passes was part of Bavin’.s reform plan.
As if Bavin or any other bygone Pre-
mier had a right to give away what
didn’t belong to him, and plant a host
of deadheads on the taxpayers!
To give “honorary” lawmakers whose
services have been dispensed with the
same privileges as are extended to mem-
bers still actively engaged in saving the
country would represent a present of a
minimum of £l5O p.a. It would be equal
to handing many of them £l5OO to £2OOO
in hard cash. Some of these gentlemen
werei rarely ;seen in the House. Others have
used their free tickets to an outrageous
extent. They have got and kept positions
because, as was said, they could “save
the company railway fares.” They have
ranged the Commonwealth on their
passes ; for, since these “courtesies,” as
they are called, are “reciprocated,” a Ma
State pass is good for the Government
railways and tramways of all Australia.
One M.L.C. went round selling shares
in a concern which has since gone bung.
Many Westralians, in particular, wish
they had never seen him.
Most countries have long since aband-
oned the expansive deadhead system.
European nations either pay their mem-
bers salaries graduated according to the
distance of their electorates from the
capital, or, as happens in Britain, the
Irish Free State and the U.S.A., allow
them travelling expenses between the seat
of government and their constituencies.
Australia, always lavish where politicians
and the noisier type of public servant are
concerned, has made such statutory pro-
vision for the handing out of passes that
all members have them, and any railway
commissioner with a stroke of the pen
can hand out more.
When the latest list of holders of all-
lines passes was issued in 1931, it was
discovered that in N. S. Wales 14 high
officers and 9 retired officers of
the railways had achieved permanent
baubles. Fourteen Maorilanders, 11
Queenslanders, 16 Victorians, 11 West-
ralians, 9 Tasmanians and seven Com-
monwealth employees or ex-employees
are also entitled to rove the continent at
will without paying a penny for rail
transit or sleeping-berths. Apart from
these, and nearly 700 Federal and State
members and Lord Mayors, 105 ex-
Ministers and ex-Judges in N. S. Wales
alone have the same right. Every
time a Sydney Premier is heaved
out after two years in office, or a
member of the N. S. Wales Executive
Council after four years, or a Speaker
or a President of the Council or a Lieut.-
Governor retires after one year on the
job. or a Chief Justice after three years,
he is given something for his watch-chain
so that he may not have to pay his way
like other men. Of course, there must
be added to this list in each State “distin-
guished visitors” from other States, and
the large and gleaming range of local
officials not in the Railway Department,
who have free travelling on annual passes
only. Among these are minor function-
aries whose duties never take them out-
side the front gate of Parliament House.
Annual-leave passes are granted to
railway employees on a huge scale. De-
siring to know the cost of these boons
in N. S. Wales, The Bulletin mildly
asked for the following information:
What free travelling privileges are granted to
servants of the Railway Department, including
wage-earners?
Do the passes take them beyond the State?
What was the value of concessions as a
whole during the last year for Which figures
are available?
It was told that the matter had been
referred to the Commissioner, and that
the Commissioner —a new man—had
given a specific instruction that “no in-
formation whatever” was to be supplied.
An official, however, admitted that all
N. S. Wales Government railwaymen and
their families, within limits, have the
right to a free annual jaunt at the coun-
try’s expense ; and, since there are 40,000
employees, this probably costs the coun-
try £200,000 a year. And in the cases
of both Parliamentarians and public ser-
vants, ex- and otherwise, every free jour-
ney made carries its load of liability in
the event of accident.
The N. S. Wales Auditor-General re-
ports that £18,546,500 has been lost on
the Government railways in seven years.
A start will have to be made with freeing
the undertaking from the vast weight of
deadheadism which oppresses it, and it
should obviously be made with Leg.
Councillors whom the people have pro-
nounced superfluous. They accepted
their positions without pay, and with the
determination, in many cases, to abol-
ish the Chamber without reference to
the people. Very deservedly in these
cases, they are themselves to be abol-
ished, and it will be an utter scandal if
they are to go on being carried free over
an insolvent system, and the six other
insolvent systems, as if nothing had hap-
pened.
IT HAS HAPPENED BEFORE.
Civilisations have a way of achieving
a certain amount of freedom, only to
find it has gone rotten on their hands.
Shortly before the Saviour was born
the Romans began to face problems like
some of those we are facing now. The
first electors had been bribed about a
century earlier. Within 50 years vote-
buying had become an institution, and
the country was crowding to the city for
its social services and amusements.
Consulships were intrigued for as
rotten boroughs were in the eighteenth
century, and as safe Parliamentary seats
are in our day. And, as in our day, a
politician often started with nothing and
became rich in a few years.
In order to support the ever-increas-
ing demands of the politicians and their
friends, more and more taxation was im-
posed, and the middle classes began to
disappear. Long before the barbarians
arrived Rome consisted largely of pro-
fiteers and dole-drawers.
Democracy did much to make Rome
great when every politician was honest,
and when even a Scipio was poor. In
modern times democratic government
went from strength to strength, checked
by occasional periods of corruption,
which were quickly countered by reform
bills. But now a stage has been reached
which seems to be inevitable in human
institutions.
The democratic system is founded
on the fallacy that all men are
equal. A fool is presumed to have as
much right to vote as a genius, an illiter-
ate as much right as a Bryce or a Dicey.
Hence, logically, universal suffrage. The
system, to quote Aldous Huxley, is one
“whereby confidence tricksters, rich men
and quacks may be given power by the
votes of an electorate composed in a
great part of mental Peter Pans.”
When democracy was in its prime
Bagehot propounded his comfortable
theory of the transferability of labor. If
an industry failed the employees auto-
matically got work in some other indus-
try. Demagogues have stopped all that.
Counsel for the C.S.R. appeared before
the Full Bench of the Queensland Arbi-
tration Court a few days ago, and argued
that the Court “ought not to prohibit a
man from working because he was not a
unionist.”
Justice Webb (president): “How can prefer-
ence to unionists be obtained if the Court does
otherwise?”
So, as in other countries and ages,
modern Australia has its “two nations”:
the sheltered aristocrats of trade-unions,
and the dole-drawing helots.
Sacrifice of freedom of speech and
action is the price that must be paid by
those who want to remain members of
the privileged class. The orders of the
officials who attend to the enforcements
of the Court’s awards must be obeyed,
and the policies and candidates decided
on by inner groups must be supported
under penalty of expulsion. And expulsion
may mean destitution. Under this device
for putting supreme power in the hands
of a few political bosses, men are no more
equal than soldiers are on active service
or than the English were under feudal-
ism or than the Romans were under the
Caesars.
The depression has made the world
distrustful of democracy. Even the
democrats don’t seem to believe that the
mess can be cleaned up on democratic
lines. Most of the great European coun-
tries and the U.S.A. have dictators, who
are proceeding on the assumption that
mankind is not equal, and that elected
persons are liable to be menaces. Says
W. M. Hughes, who once handled the
catchwords of demagoguery as readily
as any man: —•
Either democracy must prove that it can
grapple with these problems of government,
or it must make way for some other form
of government.
The obvious and only remedy is to take
the vote away from the Peter Pans, who
don’t want it anyhow, and confine it to
those who are mentally qualified to exer-
cise it. Voting tests are at least as de-
sirable from the standpoint of public
safety as, say, car-driving tests.
AUSTRALIAN TYPES.
Australia is beginning to produce dif-
ferent types and accents, as England has
done in its counties. Although the
casual observer may miss the points
of difference that are arising, they are
none the less obvious to those whose
duty takes them from State to State.
The Westralian is a type, and a very
attractive one, for all his grudge
against the Eastern States. He feels
that he is cut off from his fellows
to an unreasonable extent and he
fears that the separation is doing
him no good. Hence the secession vote:
a vigorous expression of opinion that
he is quite well able to do without his
patronising Eastern brothers, thank you!
You arrive in Perth a stranger, and in
a few days you have open invitations
to homes, and are offered a friendship
as sincere as it is spontaneous.
The Adelaide man has a reputa-
tion for conservatism. He tells you so
himself, and is rather pleased about it.
This denizen of a city which is so very
like an English university town is not
prepared to embrace you on sight; he is
English enough to want to know some-
thing about you before he commits him-
self. But, once having decided, he is
yours, provided you do nothing to dis-
turb the relationship. “Adelaide for cul-
ture,” said the wandering Scotch jour-
nalist ; and Adelaide insists on your
recognising it.
Melbourne? Its solidity strikes you ;
it looks as if it had been built to stay. It
has dignity. The Melbourne newspapers
are dignified ; the City Council is digni-
fied ; St. Kilda-road is dignified; and
dignified is the Melbourne man. Belong-
ing to the coldest corner of the continent,
he must inevitably be a home-lover. Mel-
bourne homes are charming places, and
Melbourne family life is very satisfying.
The Melbourne public-school man is
more English than anybody else in Aus-
tralia.
The Sydney man is distinct in type, and
so is his city. A sort of Naughty Sister,
looked on with a certain amount of dis-
approval by other members of the family,
but secretly admired. She doesn’t care
much whether you say you like her or
not; she knows you do, anyhow. One
would expect the semi-tropical position of
Sydney to produce a certain listlessness in
the population. Nothing of the kind: the
Sydney man is brisk, and fertile of new
ideas. Tradition means nothing to him.
He produces the most radical school of
politics in Australia, and most of the
magazine section of Australian journal-
ism ; he finds a home for Australia’s out-
standing artists —many of them Victorian-
born. He has a spontaneity of welcome
that is the nearest thing to that of the
Westralian.
The tropics are weaving their spell on
the Queenslander. He is an easy-going
individual, none the less shrewd in busi-
ness, and has an air of happiness. On
a boat he is prepared to join in any-
thing and do anything. At times he does
not quite understand the reserve, as he
calls it, of the Victorian and the South
Australian. He attaches himself more
readily to the Sydneysider; there is a
strong bond of friendship between them.
Sit on the top of a London ’bus and
you can pick an Australian nine times
out of ten. His physical appearance is
already distinct: lean. long ,and lithe,
with eyes that sit well back and are nar-
rowed. He sees no point in hiding what
he thinks. Kindly and generous, he offers
a hospitality that is sometimes embarrass-
ing to an Englishman, and resents stand-
offishness. Like all young people, he is
super-sensitive to criticism, and is desper-
ately anxious to have himself and his
country liked. He looks to the future ; he
believes that every man has a right to
get some enjoyment out of life. For the
rest, you must take him as you find him,
and if you don’t he is sufficiently sure of
himself to feel that the loss is yours.
SHIP’S SURGEON.
PLAIN ENGLISH.
Historic Chartered Companies.
History has a ready answer to those
who suggest that giving powers over
areas in North Australia to chartered
companies will sell sections of Australia
into perpetual economic slavery.
In an earlier day chartered companies
were established on terms which no
modern Government would dare to con-
cede. The Van Diemen’s Land Co., for
instance, which opened up the North of
Tasmania and had its headquarters at
Circular Head, and the Australian Agri-
cultural Co., which secured large tracts
on the Hunter, with headquarters at
Stroud and Gloucester, were quite amen-
able to public opinion and to legislation,
even though they held freehold grants,
and though the A. A. Co. had vast coal
holdings, where the northern companies
will have only leaseholds and no internal
fuel supplies. The roots of South Aus.
development sprang from G. F. Angas’s
South Australian Company.
The Van Diemen’s Land Co. gave us
the first known pedigreed shorthorn
cattle. Its herds, descended from the
Van Amburgh tribes, in time permeated
and revolutionised the quality of nearly
the whole of the beef stock of Aus-
tralia. The company brought out hun-
dreds of hardy Yorkshire and Midland
emigrants and settled them in Tasmania
and elsewhere. They developed the cul-
tivation of the potato and fixed the seed
of some of the earliest varieties.
The Australian Agricultural Co.,
founded in 1826, imported the second
shipment of pure Durham cattle to N.
S. Wales, and some of the best of the
early rams and horses, and did more
towards establishing the technique of
the pastoral industry than any other con-
cern or individual, John Macarthur not
excepted. More than that, it gave us
some of our finest pastoralists. Dawson,
its first superintendent, was guide, philo-
sopher and friend to many an early
stockbreeder.
The first Dangar was an A. A. Co.
employee. So indeed was the first of
the Whites, whose pastoral operations
now extend from the Hunter to Brunette,
in the N.T., and who have a hundred
years of unbroken pastoral experience to
look back on. The Learmonths, too,
were connected with the company, and
many another well-known pioneer family
which came out with only experience as
capital.
The A. A. Co. still exists, but its in-
terests have largely been merged into
those of other concerns. It continues to
own fine properties like Warrah. But
what modern demagogue fears its clutch
upon the nation’s throat?
♦
Melbourne’s Milk Merger.
An important step in efficient distribu-
tion of food products is being taken in
Melbourne, where the leading milk cos.
aim at completing a half-million-pound
merger to simplify deliveries and ensure
purity of supply and standardisation of
equipment.
It is years, almost ages, since the
ordinary citizen marvelled over the
wastefulness of having six suburban
homes each visited by a different milk
cart, and the consequent danger of im-
pure milk due to the multiplication of
small dairies with insufficient capital to
instal hygienic plants.
The ordinary citizen’s mystification has
been echoed through the ages by the
politicians, the press and all the other
Great Leaders of Public Thought, but
they have simply deplored the position
and left it at that. Now somebody—
possibly spurred on by the depression,
which is certainly having the effect of
making industries efficient —has been
game to cease deploring and get busy ;
and, at time of writing, it looks as if
the merger will be consummated.
If it succeeds in functioning success-
fully, it is likely that the butchers and
the grocers and the vegetable Johns will
also form mergers and that the traffic of
spring carts in suburban streets will be
greatly reduced, with beneficial results in
speed of delivery and reduced costs to
the householder.


Figures Tell the Story.
The Australian banking figures for the
June quarter give a fair idea of what
Lang’s expulsion from office last year
meant to the Commonwealth, and par-
ticularly to the State which he would
have destroyed.
In Victoria the contraction in bank
deposits compared with the same quarter
of 1932 was £7,588,443. N. S. Wales
deposits rose £4,416,367 ; changes in the
other States were small: there was
£3,000,000 less of customers’ money held
as a whole. All this seems to mean
that capital which trekked across the
Murray for safety has returned home,
and that a lot more of it is working
instead of lying idle —though some of the
decrease is due to money export follow-
ing the fall of the dollar.
The expansion in advances and secu-
rities held as between June last year and
June this year was £14,000,000;
£6,347,000 was accounted for m Vic-
toria and £3,866,000 in N. S. Wales.
Some of this is the fruit of better times
and increased industrial activity. The
rest is partly explained by the recently-
floated Australian internal loan.
In every State except Westralia, bank
clearances show expansion. Sydney
figures from January 1 to July 10
increased over the same period of 1932
by £159,712,327, or more than 50
per cent. ; those for Melbourne by
£26,189,996 ; for Brisbane by £1,313,120.
Business everywhere is beginning to
behave as if it had had a good feed of
corn, and were passing out of the con-
valescent stage. So that with the possi-
bility that the U.S.A. wheat crop will
be the smallest for years, and with wool
prices sticking their heads above the
undergrowth of depression with a cheer-
ful grin towards the future, Australia
may soon be her old self again, with
no financiers miserable except those who
lend money on mortgage to socialisation
newspapers.
In a year or two we may even be
able to afford once more such almost-
forgotten luxuries as strikes.
♦—
Who Are the Reformers?
Dear Bulletin, —It makes me laugh to
listen to Reds and Pinks who attribute
every reform which has been achieved in
N. S. Wales to their own peculiar poli-
ticians. They need to study local history.
Every really important bit of democratic
pioneering done in N. S. Wales and most
other Australian States has emanated
from “Tories.”
Triennial Parliaments date back to
1874, before there was a Parliamentary
Labor party ; free, secular and compul-
sory education owes its existence to
Parkes. Old-age pensions in N. S. Wales
and Victoria were introduced by Liberal
Governments. John See, a produce
merchant, established the first N. S.
Wales Arbitration Court, a closer-settle-
ment policy and the women’s franchise,
and he reduced the membership of the
State Parliament from 125 to 90, besides
initiating a series of reforms which demo-
cratised education.
Carruthers abolished school fees,
founded the children’s courts, arranged
the first regular organised medical in-
spection of school children and provided
the first invalidity and accident pensions
paid. Wade went out with a Saturday
half-holiday established, a Minimum
Wage Act passed and wages boards and
subventions to friendly societies intro-
duced ; his Government also passed the
Pure Foods Act,
The two years of McGowen are vir-
tually a blank, though Holman opened
baby clinics and implemented the first
scheme introduced to make State
advances for home-building. To Hol-
man, too, in his last Labor days, were
due the Fair Rents Court and the Eight
Hours Act and the extension of workers’
compensation to all workers. He added
to his performance (after he had become
a “Tory”) by putting the Poor Persons’
Legal Remedies Act on the Statute Book,
passing the Women’s Legal Status Act
and initiating the State housing scheme,
leaving it for John Storey to give us a
stillborn Profiteering Prevention Act, the
44-hour week and compulsory school
attendance.
I was nearly forgetting Lang. But I
can’t think of anything the workers owe
to “Labor’s great leader” but tin hares,
fruit machines, lotteries, milk at seven-
pence a quart, the 5 p.c. wages tax and
11 shillings in the pound for those who
had to sell their deposits in the Savings
Bank that he burst. —Yours etc., Colo-

An Actor Writes “History.”
A London journal is publishing the
reminiscences of Frank Gerald, an actor
who played to Australian audiences. A
recent instalment has a heading three
columns wide: “For the Term of His
Natural Life.... Among the Victims
of John Price, the Human Monster.”
Gerald’s story is that, having staged
“For the Term of His Natural Life” in
Brisbane and Sydney (this was in 1895),
he felt that it would be only courteous
to allow Tasmanians to see their earlier
selves as he and Marcus Clarke conceived
them. So in the time of “Lord”
Hamilton —who wasn’t a lord and had
returned home two years before—our
author appeared upon a Hobart stage
in the guise of Lieut. Frere, whose ori-
ginal, he says, was John Price. Price,
he explains, expected his floggers to be
ambidextrous so as to get a nice, criss-
cross pattern on their victims. History,
more veracious than Mr. Gerald, records
that Price had left Tasmania 42 years
before with the reputation of having
been one of the few humane Van Die-
men’s Land convict superintendents.
Of course, all the old lags who had
suffered torture at the hands of Mr. Price
turned up to see a lifelike representa-
tion of “the brute under whom they suf-
fered.” Gerald conceived him as one
who “when in a fit of passion would
tear his hair out by the roots until the
blood poured down his cheeks.” A sea
of “most appalling and murderous faces
from which all trace of humanity seemed
to have disappeared” stared from behind
the bars of the pit—the hardy and
enduring ex-convicts ; and as soon as the
villain was recognised “like a sudden
crack of thunder, like the roar of cages
and cages of wild beasts suddenly let
loose upon their prey, came the yells,
oaths, screeches and curses from those
inhuman faces behind the bars.” It was
a “ghastly... .horrible sight. A storm of
blasphemy swept the house”.... Ladies
fainted. “Lord” Hamilton mysteriously
appeared and shook the actor by the
hand.
Hobart atoned by taking the outraged
visitor to see Jim Crow, the companion
of Clarke’s Gabbett. Gerald found him,
“his head but a yellow skin stretched
across his skull... .eyes like pin-points
.... a mouth which gibbered” ; but that,
of course, was only to be expected of
anybody who (1) had been invented (in
common with Gabbett) by Marcus Clarke
for the purposes of fiction, (2) had appa-
rently in his unreal state been tied by
the leg in a Hobart dungeon, the prey
of successive villainous superintendents
for 73 years.
The liar at large in London can be
interesting in his fashion, but this sort of
thing is hard on the mild Tasmania of
the ’nineties.

A Tramwayman’s Indictment.
Dear Bulletin, —Mr, Bruxner need not
feel so gratified about the Sydney tram-
way finances (B. 26/7/’33). Any child
could have got the same results with the
same methods —working the employees
longer and harder and cutting down their
wages. Some firms have not taken
advantage of the lowered wages, and yet
have paid dividends ; that shows man-
agerial ability. A departmental witness
in the 44-hour case said the estimated
deficit for the year was £llO,OOO. Thai
statement was made six weeks before the
end of the financial year, which showed
a credit balance of £lB9B. It leaves a
nasty taste in the mouth.
The N. S. Wales Department of Trans-
port has the worst rolling-stock in the
Commonwealth, and shows the worst re-
sults. Gross tramway profits for 1931-32
(1932-33 figures are not available) were
3.4 per cent in N. S. Wales, 9 per cent,
in Victoria, 3.3 per cent, in South Aus.
and 9.17 per cent, in Queensland. A
comparative statement for drivers and
conductors:
N.S.W. Vic. S.A.
Passengers carried 66,416 62,710 56,753
Revenue collected £766 £738 £760
Those results were achieved in 44 hours
in N. S. Wales and 48 hours in the other
States. Average fare paid in 1931-32 was
2.7 d. in N. S. Wales, 2.8 d. in Melbourne
and 3.2 d. in Adelaide.
During the past year fare reductions
to the extent of £500,000 were made to
N. S. Wales tram travellers. But what
about the employees? Services have been
speeded up 18 per cent., wages reduced
25 per cent, (exclusive of special State
taxation), hours increased 9 per cent. In
September 300 men of the traffic branch
are to be sacked to pay for those “re-
placements.” Meantime the system car-
ries the biggest percentage of salaried men
in Australia. The men continue to walk
a plank that brings about an average of
one accident a day. An employee has
now to wear a wet uniform till it dries
on him. We see the strongest of men
going off with t.b. and kindred com-
plaints, and traffic employees have a
chest history that puts many so-called
dangerous trades out of the argument.
If Mr. Bruxner is really gratified, he is
not hard to please.—Yours etc., Con-
ductor.
The Federal-aid Roads.
Dear Bulletin, —Whether the Wadda-
mana (B. 19/7/’33) or some other route
is the best to join up Launceston with
the West Coast road is of little interest
outside Launceston. Owing to the per-
sistence of Queenstown, which wanted
a holiday outlet for its citizens, and of
Hobart, which wished to filch trade from
the North-West district, Tasmania was
saddled with a road connection which
cost nearly £200,000. Launcestonians
opposed it, with solid reason, till it was
completed, and then turned round and
demanded an additional outlay of £25,000
to give them a quick connection through
the mountains to the road.
The whole business is pretty sordid,
but its wider interest lies in the fact that
only the Federal Aid Roads Act made
it possible. This Act was passed in 1926,
when the Federal Government was roll-
ing in easy money. It provided for dis-
tribution among the States of £20,000,000
in ten years. The States were to find 15s.
for every £1 received from the Common-
wealth (they had to be relieved from this
obligation), and road-construction had to
conform to Federal plans.
Reckless construction was a natural
corollary. Specifications were rigid, and
so you had grades and widths suited to
the flat country of other States but most
unsuited to the mountain regions of Tas-
mania. If there is one job which the
States can do better than the Federal
authority, it is that of making their own
roads. Amid all the follies and ex-
travagances of Federation none stands
out more flagrant than this intrusion into
the affairs of the States, this exaction of
tax-revenue not essential to Federal needs
and squandering of the excess on idiotic
conditions. Yours etc., Hartwell
Conder.

Free Speech and Privilege.
Reform of the laws and customs govern-
ing Parliamentary privilege is long over-
due. Except that their behavior is a bad
advertisement for themselves and the
system, it matters little what politicians
do to one another. Members will be
members; and if the representative of
Dead Dog Creek calls the chosen of One
Horse Gully a putrefied abomination, the
assailed one can safely retort with re-
flections on his traducer’s ancestry or
cross the House and hold him by the
weasand until he retracts.
At the worst, on such occasions, little
harm is done to anybody except the
offenders. The Speaker will always guard
the sensibilities of an outraged House by
demanding apologies all round ; and if
apologies are not forthcoming the offen-
ders may be suspended. There is redress,
and plenty of it, to meet such emergen-
cies.
It is only when the private citizen is
assailed that the application of privilege
becomes rank injustice. The private citi-
zen who retorts to the member for Dead
Dog courts an action for slander, but the
abusive owner of a gold pass may say
what he likes inside Parliament about
the private citizen. He need not
worry about good faith, truth, public
benefit or the other pitfalls which beset
the way of the private adventurer in
libel. All he needs to do is to think up
something venomous, beef it out and see
that it gets into Hansard ; or, if he is a
Minister, have it embalmed in a Parlia-
mentary paper.
The “Labor Daily’s” mortgagee, J. T.
Lang, is addicted to making privileged
attacks on rivals in the newspaper
field. In his latest assault he used
the words “crookedness,” “this gang of
respectable thieves,” “swindle,” “scur-
rilous rags which issue from this cesspit”
and “swindling humbugs.” Challenged to
repeat his charges “outside,” he did not
reply. Nothing can be done about
it by those whom he assailed, any
more than by those civil servants against
whom Senator Reid made insinuations
in the Senate. That old gentleman
alleged corruption in the Customs.
Having found himself mistaken, he with-
drew the charges. Had he made them
anywhere else he might not have got off
with a mere withdrawal.
Of course, members of Parliament
should not be trammelled in exposing
public abuses and inveighing against
wrongdoing. But they should have no
license to throw mud with impunity.
There should be a parliamentary com-
mittee of privilege, charged with the duty
of receiving petitions from private citi-
zens against whom allegations of turpi-
tude are made without supporting evi-
dence, who are attacked maliciously and
injuriously, and of recommending to the
House that they should be placed in a
position to vindicate their reputation in
the courts.
These Revolutionaries.
Countries which indulge in the luxury
of revolutions always fall into a period
of decay. It is because the practical
people who do things and like doing
them are turned out, and people who
only talk about doing things replace
them. France was in a pretty bad way
before the Revolution. After that event
it nearly collapsed under the gentle min-
istrations of the idealists. Russia passed
through the same experience until the
idealists were ousted by the realists.
China is still in the initial stages of re-
volutionary disintegration.
The Manchus were not as degenerate
as is commonly supposed. They were far
more seized with reforming zeal than
the conservative Chinese subordinates;
it was actually their tentative attempts at
Westernisation which caused their down-
fall. When they went, order went with
them, and the idealistic blatherskite came
into his own. Ever since 1911 China has
been relapsing into barbarism.
The idealists were too busy framing
Utopias to bother about strengthening
the dykes that kept back the Yellow and
the Yangtse rivers, and floods have de-
vastated the country. In 1931 whole cities
were inundated, and 20 million people
were reduced to famine. Another similar
catastrophe is threatened at the moment.
The peasants have helped by chopping
down the trees on the ancestral estates
of the big landowners. The Government
started various grandiose schemes of re-
afforestation, but somebody always
pinched the money. Plague prevention,
which a brilliant Chinese scientist had
developed under Manchu direction, has
also been neglected.
Chronic failures of the food crops have
caused terrible privations. Most of the
provinces are under military dictator-
ships, in a state of civil war or Com-
munist convulsion, but the politicians at
Nanking are still working out fancy pro-
jects for finding the millennium round
the corner, and any glib person with no
knowledge but plenty of assurance is
certain of a hearing.

A Little Powder.
A learned Judge mentioned in the
Divorce Court at Sydney recently that
when he was a boy he would not look
at a girl who powdered. If girls had
powdered then as they powder now, he
would have looked at them all right and
have liked doing it.
After all, the urge of young woman-
hood to improve on nature is only akin
to the vanity which leads Bench and
Bar to cover its domes with horsehair
and its lounge suits with scarlet and
ermine. Among older and more dis-
cerning races than our own, the deco-
rative instinct of the weaker sex is capi-
talised so that man may benefit by it.
The Central African, for instance, per-
suades his fair that she looks lovelier
with her lower lip stretched round a
soup-plate, because he wishes to limit
those powers of conversation which every
husband dreads. No lady can be effec-
tively critical or even wheedling when
the lower half of her mouth flaps during
speech like a banana-leaf in a tornado.
And she dare not snore, because the
slightest facial movement turns her pro-
truding glory into a natural punkah
which fans her into wakefulness.
The Australian savage knocks his
bride’s front teeth out at the wedding,
not, as he avers, for aesthetic reasons, but
really because he knows that a wife with-
out front teeth cannot eat steak. Hence-
forward, she must confine herself to soup
and leavings, while her lord dines off
luscious kangaroo. The abo.’s South
Sea neighbor hangs his hard-won cash
in his lady’s ear to keep it in sight.
No dame of Vanikoro may make free
with her housekeeping allowance without
afterwards displaying a certain lack of
balance in her facial adornment; and
the absence of click and rattle about
her as she turns the latchkey tells her
watchful partner when she has had a
bad afternoon at bridge even before he
perceives the gaping vacancy of her
lobes.
Even if a Hitler preferred female faces
an naturel he would have to consider
economic effects before he banned
powdering. He would need to ask him-
self : “How many millions would I throw
out of work if I succeeded in this
crusade? How many Chinese mothers
would die through the slump in the rice
crop which I would cause? What would
be the effect on the fuller’s-earth market
and on female employment when every
typist was able to devote herself fully
to her keys without the now customary
titivating intervals? How many shops
which live on the cosmetic trade would
cease to exist?”


Society
"AND IT'S PRINTED WITH WIMBLE'S INKS"
“This is no time to come home, dear.”
“I know, Granny, but it was such a dud dance that I got fed up.”
“D. Empson”: What becomes of de-
feated politicians? Where have the show
people gone since the decline of the circus
and the music-hall? I can answer that
one —into the aviation business. There,
in new settings, are to be found all the
limelighters we knew in simpler days:
the trapeze artist, the clown, the lion
comique (who was such a devil among
the women), even the saucy soubrette.
The rewards differ tremendously, as be-
fore, and few get regular engagements,
but their hunger for the applause of
crowds and newspapers is more or less
satisfied. Mrs. Miller and Captain Lan-
caster are perfect music-hall characters,
of the sort that was “resting” most of the
time (Lancaster, poor devil, hasn’t been
seen since his unsuccessful appearance
in one of the Nigerian “smalls”). And
the Mollisons, Amy and Jimmy. Don’t
they take you back to the sawdust and
the flaring lights? Can’t you hear the
ringmaster saying, “Ladies and gentle-
men, with your kind attention, the Fly-
ing Mollisons will now do their death-
defying dive from the top of the tent into
that tank containing six feet of water. 1
thank you!” And their trans-Atlantic
stunt was just as useless.

“E.C.A.”: The wording of the tele-
gram which the Cue progress committee
sent to Queen Victoria in 1894 (B.
19/7/’33) was Biblical enough for a
synod. The version of Psalm cxxix given
in the Book of Common Prayer contains
the following words: “The Lord prosper
you; we wish you good luck in the
name of the Lord.” From this one may
deduce that the pioneers of Cue included
at least one man well versed in the Angli-
can liturgy. The Authorised Version
gives a different translation.
* * * *
“Nakh”: It is a queer fact that the
modern mechanised human being seems
to hate Nature. If he is given the chance
he will choose artificial rather than real
wool, silk, soup and fruitjuice. In the
houses he builds he tries to make wood
look like stone, stone like wood and lino,
like marble. He buys radio sets resem-
bling shelves of books, and his middle-
aged wife does her darnedest to make
mature charm into callow flapperdom.
Australians are alleged to love their
national flora, but I prophesy the time
when they will buy it in a Japanese imi-
tation. As a first step in that direction
Melbourne florists’ windows have lately
been flooded with synthetic heath, and
flower-lovers show such a preference for
the factory product that the growers of
the natural bloom are clamoring for a
boycott. The artificial article has it all
over Nature because the manufacturer
can let his imagination run riot amidst
color combinations old Mother hasn’t
yet thought of; and he does it to some
purpose.

“Der Jong”: Reference to the Boer
objection to census-taking (B. 26/ 7/’33)
reminds me of an experience in
the Provisional Mounted Police, which
was the start of the South African
Constabulary. With Pretoria taken, the
war was supposed to be over, and a
beginning was made to take a census of
humans and stock, the job being given
to the police. My station was in the
north-east of the Free State, close to
Basutoland, a district where the real old-
style Boer flourished. The first visit was
to a wild upland farm, all the men from
which were out with De Wet. The only
white occupant was an old and very
stout vrouw. She sat on the stoep making
candles by dipping dried vegetable fibres
into a tub of melted tallow. For an
hour I and my Cape-boy interpreter
sought information. The old lady never
answered a word or looked at us, going
steadily on with her job as if she were
all alone in the wilderness. That was
my only experience, for I was transferred
to some other stunt the next day.

“M.H.E.”: The site at the corner of
Bridge and Phillip streets, Sydney, on
which the N. S. Wales Government pro-
poses to rear an ungainly mountain of
office buildings is hallowed by the pro-
fanity of early Governors who found
the agglomerate Government House,
which grew there from Phillip's begin-
nings, inadequate and too leaky for
their needs. Of old, it looked out across
the pleasant headwaters of Sydney
Cove to picturesque Dawes Point, with
“At the party last night they tried for half an hour to get me to sing."
“REALLY, dear! Yet I suppose you were doing your best?”
its two half-moons of sandy beach, and
the uninhabited fastnesses of the North
Shore beyond. Many historical associa-
tions cling round the now disfigured spot.
Thither came early guests in scarlet or
muslin, carrying their own bread during
the “days of short allowance” ; thither
marched Johnston to tuck o’ drum to
find Bligh under the bed. There Mac-
quarie planned the first real roads, the
first street lighting, the first interior settle-
ment, the first presentable churches and
public buildings and (with his secretary,
Campbell, who had been in the Bank of
Ireland) the first bank in Australia. The
first Legislative Council was born there
in 1824. The only extant link with it
is the Blue Bell Inn behind the Union
Club in Phillip-street. Now sunk to
laundry level (about as far as a pub can
fall), it was once the haven in which vice-
regal servants drank their tots and
smoked their clays.
* * * *
“El Verdugo”: The Duke of Con-
naught, who was still hale and hearty
enough to officiate at the inauguration of
the new Masonic Temple in Lon-
don the other day, forms a curious
link with the illustrious past. Thack-
eray chronicled his arrival in 1850
in a slightly derisive ballad, and he
was the last godson of the Duke
of Wellington, on whose birthday
he was born. The long lives of
godfather and godson already
stretch over 164 years, so that there
is a man living to-day who walked
through Apsley House with a
friend of the younger Pitt—with a
soldier who was gazetted to his
regiment (the 73rd, afterwards
commanded by Macquarie) the
year before Australia was founded.
It is a record not equalled often,
though the lives of two Earls of
Leicester stretched from 1754 til?
the early years of the present century,
and the present chief of Clan Gillian
(Maclean of Dowart) is the son of an
intimate friend of our own Governor
Macquarie.
* * * *
“Soso”: In 1923 a warrant was issued
for a Ma Stater charged with disobey-
ing a magisterial order for the support
of his wife. Defendant evaded service
until a few days ago. Now he is in quod
pending police inquiries as to what his
wife wants done. The charge against
him is failing to pay £1374, and the Law
provides imprisonment for one day for
each 4s. due, so this man has earned a
sentence of 6870 days, close on 19 years.
But even a deserted wife would hardly
press for that.

“X.S.”: For sheer phlegm it would be
difficult to find anyone to beat Stanley
Kelly, aged six years and ten months,
and his brother Maurice, five, who were
lost in the thick forest around Orbost
(Vic.) for three days. Their mother had
sent them across to a neighbor’s to
borrow tea and jam and on the return
journey they thought they would take a
short cut. Four hundred men, accom-
panied by reporters and press photo-
graphers, went after them, and finally
one of the searchers came on the miss-
ing pair as they were walking down to a
stream for water. They expressed
innocent surprise that any fuss had been
made about them. They had been quite
all right, they said ; although their feet
hurt a bit —as a matter of fact, stone and
gravel were embedded in the soles and
their clothes had been torn to ribbons.
They had spent one bitterly cold night
under a fern: the other two nights they
had made nests in hollow logs and had
been quite warm, they said. They had
been making a fresh home in a log snug
with leaves and bracken when their
rescuers found them.

“C.Q.”: Even the sternest protag-
onists of freedom are not immune from
vanity. A Melbourne Communist, a Uni.
product, flung himself into the contest
for liberty of speech which lately raged
round General Blarney’s somewhat ill-
advised efforts to prevent political
spruikers addressing the Friday-night
crowds in Sydney-road, Brunswick. He
was grabbed and flung into the watch-
house. A Trades Hall worthy went bail
for him, and told him so. “How much?”
inquired the victim of oppression. “Only
a fiver,” replied his benefactor. “A
fiver!” cried the horrified martyr. “It’s
a deliberate insult. I expected it to be at
least a hundred!”

“Idle Imp”: Ever noticed the technique
which the depression has developed in
fag-butt collectors? A stub glimpsed on
footpath or gutter and the searcher non-
chalantly pauses, glances covertly round
and then, unless the coast is clear, finds
a recalcitrant bootlace that needs atten-
tion and makes his grab for his find
less apparent. In Elizabeth-street, Syd-
ney, I even encountered a seedy indi-
vidual who dropped a brown every time
he came to a fag-end, palming the butt
as he stooped for the coin. There’s no
surer test of the depresh down-and-out;
the oldtimer tackles the job blatantly and
with no feeling of shame.

“Univ.”: It looks as if the N. S.
Wales Anglicans had at last picked a
winner in Bishop Mowll. Their previous
Archbishops have been colorless ; for all
the impression they made on the com-
munity in general they might have been
in England. Bishop Mowll seems inter-
esting, even exciting, as far away as
China is. The quality is as elusive and
indefinable as the universal appeal of
some movie stars. Dean Inge, who is
highly intellectual and combative, and
the Rev. Dick Shepherd, who is neither,
have it; the Archbishop of Canterbury
hasn’t, great man though he is. A
number of Sydney Presbyterians have had
it. Dr. Lang interested everybody in his
day, and quarter of a century ago there
were few Sydneyites who didn’t know all
about Dr. Dill Macky. R.C. prelates
have mostly attracted the public eye in
N. S. Wales, whether they have
been mild Englishmen like Archbishop
Vaughan or belligerent Hibernians like
Cardinal Moran. The largest denomina-
tion in N. S. Wales has been ill-treated
—particularly in regard to its cathedral
—for the best part of a century largely
because it has never had a striking per-
sonality at the head of affairs who was
capable of making his protests resound
through the State. Bishop Mowll strikes
me somehow as being the kind of cleric
whose complaints will be attended to,
particularly by politicians, the moment
they are uttered.
THOSE GOLD PASSES.
[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
O, it stings the same as a stockwhip might, it
cuts like a butcher’s knife,
To lose a job that you fondly hoped to hold
the rest of your life!
But there’s more than half ofrns booked to go
—no getting away from that —
And there’s little use in chewing the rag and
less in whipping the cat.
Meantime the thing that worries us most,
while we’re waiting the coup de grace, is
What will the final fiat be about our golden
passes?
O, those golden passes we’ve been wont to wear
Tacked to our weskit chains,
Those emblems rare that were good for fare
On all o’ the trams and trains,
Those sesames for M.L.C.’s
To travel in deadhead style:
Will the spoilers strip us of even these
Or let us keep them awhile?
O, ’twas fine to sit in the Council hall while the
placid hours slipped by!
It made you feel like the gods of old upon
Olympus high.
We met and mixed it in sage harangue, we
bandied the lightsome word,
Far, far away from the madding crowd, remote
from the vulgar herd.
We drew no pay, like the M.L.A.; our hearts
were not where the brass is;
There was never guerdon for statesmanship
save only those golden passes.
We served the State as patriots should, and we
had no need to care
Who picked us out for eminence and why they
sent us there.
’Twas Liberty Hall for most of us, as you may
well suppose,
Where a chap could come when he darned well
liked and vote as he darned well chose.
There were some from what, in the Sydney
“Dom.,” they call the “ruling classes,”
And more from the horny-handed ranks; but
we all got golden passes.
Ah me! but here was a haven snug and a
mighty pleasant place,
With never a dread of election time and con-
stituents to face.
Now out. to a cold, hard world we go, from
seats where we lolled at ease,
Deprived of letters behind our names and shorn
of our dignities.
At the good old home that is ours no more we
gaze through tear-dimmed glasses
And wonder mournfully what they’ll do about
our golden passes.
O, those golden passes we wore with pride,
To save us many a wad
And let us ride o’er the countryside
On what they call the nod;
Those guarantees we were once grandees
Who basked in Fortune’s smile:
Will the reivers strip us of even these
Or let us keep them awhile?

T. THE R.


“Black Mountain”: Recently a com-
petition was instituted for a coat of arms
to be adopted by the University Asso-
ciation of Canberra. Prizes were
awarded, but none of the designs is
likely to be used. Canberra is unfortu-
nate in these matters. John Butters, when
Chief Commissioner, called for designs
for a coat of arms to be used by the
Administration. I accompanied a news-
paper man on his rounds on the day the
winner was to be announced. “There
will be no winner,” said the Chief Com-
missioner. Holding aloft several plasters
he exclaimed, “Look at them! Designs,
for coats of arms! For jam-tin labels
rather!”

“Cauboy”: The fact that Melbourne
composers made almost a clean sweep
of the prizes in the A.B.C.’s musical com-
petition is a fresh demonstration of
Rodin’s dictum, “Beauty is Slowness.”
The tempo of material existence in the
southern city is definitely slower than in
Sydney. We still cling to our remaining
cable-trams with a tenacity that suggests
that there is some principle involved. We
are going so slowly to work at our cen-
“Gosh! You look lovely!”
“I’ve nothing special on.”
“But look at all you’ve left off, my girl!”
tenary celebrations that the date will be
past before we have decided what we are
going to do about it. We were slower in
getting into the depression, and will per-
haps be slower in climbing out of it,
than our Sydney brothers. The legisla-
tors of Spring-street slumber longer be-
tween bills than the lawmakers of Mac-
quarie-street. Compared with Lang and
Garden, our Don Camerons and such
other mild revolutionaries as we have are
incorrigible slowcoaches. It took us a
long time to succumb to the talkies,
and there is still a considerable public
for the legitimate theatre and the
symphony concert. The Melbourne citi-
zen has a better chance of growing old
than the Sydneyite. In 1930 there were
894 deaths from senility in N.S.W. as
against 1000 in Victoria.

“Crutch”: The walking-stick is by no
means the back number that “D” (B.
26/7/’33) suggests. The day I read that
par. I counted half a dozen in a short
walk down George-street, Sydney. To
many people a stick is a means of em-
ploying otherwise awkwardly empty
hands. To others it serves as a useful
support in many circumstances, especi-
ally to those who avoid crowded
grandstands at race-meetings and foot-
ball matches, and have to stand for hours
at a time. Further, a stick is a useful de-
fence ; a well-delivered “point” will lay
out the most determined tough. Inciden-
tally, a stick should never be used to
strike with, it being too easily parried.
In the hands of a fencer, it is capable of
killing a man.
“Pomegranate”: The Army long agt>
realised the awkwardness of hands;
hence the swagger-stick. So, too, we have
the police officer with his cane or crop.
Thinking the cane flash, Australians
reject it, thus elevating unreposeful too-
large hands into a national characteristic.
* * * *
“Guardee”: One has to leave home to
learn the news, as witness this in Sydney
“Sun”: —
When the 10th Hussars —the Cherubims —
pride of the Army List, gave up their beloved
horses and became a unit in the new mechan-
ised army, old men in club windows foretold
the end of the horse.
The Cherubims are the 11th Hussars,
and the 10th are only the pride of the
Army List in a social sense. Just as the
Americans were once too proud to fight,
so the 10th were once too proud to dance.
“The 10th don’t dance” was the super-
cilious slogan which caused them to be
dreaded by hostesses from end to end of
Mayfair and Belgravia. The 10th haven’t
given up their horses, and neither have
the Cherubims ; the only change is that
some details, such as their machine-gun
sections, have been mechanised.
* * * *
“Hamer”: When the war came, Aus-
tralia suffered from a severe fit of re-
pentance about the German goods it had
received with open arms. A great deal
of the prejudice was directed against
pianos—previously many people had re-
garded no piano as a good one unless it
had the name of a German or Austrian
maker. Patriotic citizens made haste to
get rid of such instruments at any price,
and others employed expert workmen to
remove the obnoxious brands. A few
went even further. One Darling-Pointer
called his friends to a party at which
each guest was handed a tomahawk and
invited to do his worst with the German-
made grand piano. At the conclusion of
the orgie it occurred to someone to look
at the brand on his tomahawk. It was:
“Made in Germany.”
“Remove your clothes, please.”
“Wot! An’ you’re the bloke I bin se ndin’ the wife to!"
“F.S.”: Melbourne Working Men’s
College proposes to take advantage of
the centenary celebrations to ask the
King to grant a charter so that it can
call itself “The Royal Victorian Insti-
tute of Technology.” It is said that art
students are reluctant to join the art-
school end of the institution while its
name conveys the stigma of toil and
horny-handedness. It is now up to the
Trades Hall to ask his Majesty for per-
mission to change the name to the Royal
Victorian Mansion of Socialisation (de-
ferred indefinitely).
* * * *
“Larrapinta”: Whenever anyone men-
tions the King to Bulletin artist Oswald
Pryor, he is likely to be told. “I didn’t
meet him when he toured Australia, but
I feel that I know him slightly, for I
have often worn his trousers.” He did,
too, and this was the way of it. When
George Windsor and his elder brother
visited Aussie in the early ’eighties they
included a visit to the Moonta mines in
their itinerary, and special suits of over-
alls were made for the Royal pair to
wear while they had a look over the
underground workings. Later on these
suits were handed to Pryor, then a
draughtsman employed by the company,
to use whenever he had to go down
below. They were just his size, but were
too small for any others on the staff.
* * 4= *
“San.”: A recent query re “Scotty the
Wrinkler” reminds me of a dust-up be-
tween Scotty and J. F. Dwyer, then a Syd-
ney freelance, later to become a popular
story-writer in American magazines. It
was in the days when Archibald was
editor of The Bulletin, and Abo. contri-
butors included Ernest Favenc, Harry
Stockdale, Phil McCooey, “Jimmy Pan-
nikin” and the inimitable Scotty himself.
J.F.D. had the temerity to flatly contra-
dict one of Scotty’s statements, and the
latter, from his stronghold at Hollow
Log camp, proceeded to castigate Dwyer
severely. He wound up by challenging
his critic to a duel, giving him the choice
of single-sticks, rapiers, foils, cavalry
sabres, pistols or rifles. Then Scotty’s
sense of humor came to his aid, and he
wound up his outburst with the remark:
“But what a fool I am to take any notice
of this fellow. J.F.D. — just flapdoodle.”
* * * *
“C.Q.”: A new kind of snobbery has
grown up in the practice of people who
subdivide suburban estates putting all
sorts of covenants on them. I live on an
estate which was cut up. There may not
be erected on it shops, cinemas, churches,
charities, schools or any form of build-
ing for making anything useful Build-
ing materials were prescribed and a
minimum cost fixed for a dwelling—
boom figures, of course. The notion of
the covenant-framers was to create an
“exclusive” suburb, but the only result
is a dull uniformity of bad architecture
and a great deal of inconvenience for
residents, who have to travel outside
their own boundaries for their packets
of fags, amusements and place of
worship. The trouble about these coven-
ants is that they try to crystallise
a fashion, and once they are applied
there is no means of changing them ex-
cept by expensive legal processes. Good-
ness knows what the ideal suburb will
be 50 years hence. It might be one vast
communal house made of rubber,
* * * *
“c. 8. ”; One of the most sensible sug-
gestions yet made to the Melbourne cen-
tenary people has come from the Heidel-
berg Council, which wants a natural
amphitheatre formed by an old bank of
fo e yarra used as a stadium. The arena

“Flimsy”: Comments on the new Aus-
tralian 10s. note have been numerous,
but no one seems to have noted that the
two blank white spaces which it bears
offer unrivalled opportunities to those
people who delight in inscribing vale-
dictory and Rabelaisan remarks on the
paper currency which passes through
their hands. In old Western Queensland
days when every bank issued its own
notes (and made a profit by letting them
remain in circulation until they fell to
pieces), it was a common thing to find
notes covered front and back with
scribbled philosophy and other things,
Now, I understand, the Commonwealth
at once withdraws such notes from cir-
culation. I am tipping a busy time for
the officials when the new issue gets into
full swing.
BALLADE OF THE SHRIEKING
SISTERHOOD.
[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
“According to Judge Curlewis, it is the womenfolk
of hardened criminals who shriek and make scenes in
court when their men are sentenced.”
He knows, as only a jurist can,
His Coke and his Blackstone through and
through,
But just as closely he’s studied man
And he’s learned a lot about woman, too.
He can spot the flirt and detect the shrew
And no one better has understood
The kind that makes a hullabaloo;
O, he’s Wise to the shrieking sisterhood!
He has stern reproof for the legal clan
Colloquialisms who don’t eschew;
The blague of the racecourse brings his ban;
The slang of the pubs he holds taboo.
He’s a way of sifting the false from true
And the bad at heart from the sound and good;
And he knows as much as the Wise Man
knew
Of the ways of the shrieking sisterhood.
Since ever his reign on the bench began
He’s had obiter dicta abroad to strew.
You may value some not a pinch o’ bran,
But there’s shrewd discernment in not a few.
They never alter his Honor’s view,
As peradventure they hoped they would,
The screaming janes who make such ado.
He’s measured the shrieking sisterhood.
He knows the sinner has got his due,
The crook has copped just what he should,
When the Court resounds and the air grows
blue
With the wails of the shrieking sisterhood.

POLITICAL POINTS
The World Economic Conference has
dissolved, leaving behind it a conviction
that the day of all such gatherings is
dead. After the Napoleonic wars there
was a similar rage for conferences, and
it was only when their continued wrang-
ling about reparations and boundaries
brought Europe to the verge of another
war that Governments returned to the
older ways of diplomacy. Wellington
gave his opinion of international spout-
ing contests in terms which if might do
some good to repeat —if they could be
repeated.
It won’t be long before the Conserva-
tives drop Ramsay MacDonald. Many
of them were never keen on his blessed
conferences, at which he looked so im-
pressive and made such resounding
speeches; now this mistrust will settle
into the conviction, fatal to Rammac, that
there is nothing in the man but gas and
good intentions. When Rammy and
Roosey were burbling at Washington
about the miracles that were to be per-
formed at the World Economic Confer-
ence, Snowden denounced them as a pair
of platudinisers who had no programme
and were filling simple minds with un-
realisable hopes. How right the dour
Yorkshireman was!
Australian wheatgrowers are not to be
dragged into any Yankee crop- or ex-
port-restriction scheme, and in striving
against these fancy proposals Bruce did
well. But Bruce, it seems, offended the
State Agents-General by not acquainting
them with the progress made at the
World Economic Conference (as if there
were any progress to report!) and they
held an indignation meeting about it.
“What are we here for?” one aggrieved
functionary said. The Bulletin will be
the mug ; what are they there for?
Dairy farmers are getting 3d. a gallon
for the milk they send to butter factories.
In Sydney, however, the morning milk
is 7d. a quart. This is the retail price
fixed by the board that Lang appointed
and Stevens has kept on; and the
workers are expected to be thankful to
“the greatest leader Labor ever had.”
The Vic. Ministry’s Street Meetings
Bill, which has the approval of Labor-
leader Tunnecliffe, arises out of recent
proceedings in which it was ruled that
speakers were committing an offence if
their meetings caused even a potential
obstruction of the road. Macfarlan told
the House that the new legislation would
be on all fours with that covering negli-
gent and dangerous driving of cars. The
police will have to satisfy the Courts
that there is actual undue obstruction
befqre a conviction can be registered.
Two hundred of the 317 British settlers
who, as a royal commission reported,
were victims of optimistic Vic. politicians
are to get new holdings or have then-
present ones enlarged—that is, if the
Federal Government will assist. Finan-
cial compensation will probably be made
to some of the others who have gone
into other jobs or have none. The argu-
ment is over 10 years old, and has grown
long whiskers. So some of the
victims.
Twice in recent weeks elderly Federal
politicians with Freetrade tendencies have
made charges of corruption against Cus-
toms officers and run away from them.
Senator Reid retreated on being asked
to produce his evidence, and when it
became clear that Gregory was to be
called to account the Westralian M.H.R.
explained that he had “used the word
‘corruption’ in a political and not a per-
sonal or an individual sense.” Thirty-four
years ago a Westralian Assemblyman,
one Robson, put up a similar defence
before a royal commission appointed to
investigate charges of “rottenness and
corruption” against the Forrest Govern-
ment. It didn’t avail him. Robson, at
least, had the grace to resign his seat.
From Senator Dunn, with a “Hansard”
proof of a speech —his own, of course:
In a recent issue of your paper reference
was made to reduction of the beer duty
being debated in the House of Representatives.
This is not facts. The next move for a correc-
tion, if any, is up to The Bulletin.
There will be no correction. As here
stated, E. C. Riley, M.H.R. for Cook,
suggested a 25 p.c. reduction of the
excise on beer, and was replied to by
Minister White; their remarks were
made on May 24 and are reported in
“Hansard,” pages 1685-87. Perhaps Mr.
Dunn’s study of “Hansard” is confined
to his own speeches.
Strange how these political consciences
work! Until a month or two ago every-
body in the N. S. Wales State A.L.P.
seemed to be satisfied with Lang rule.
Now, after the miners and other power-
ful financial unions show signs of defec-
tion, a member of the executive has
begun to inveigh against “the huge dis-
bursements of party funds at Bulli.” The
gentleman added that, “as your represen-
tative on the executive,” he hadn’t
“the slightest knowledge who receives
GLANDLESS MONKEY : " I hope the first nut he eats chokes him!”
and who disburses large amounts of
party funds, nor of any details of the
source or destination of such money.”
Yet the same executive (including the
shocked gentleman who is now shout-
ing) has asserted for years that it stands
for the sacred principle of rank-and-file
control.
The N.S.W. Railway Board of Inquiry
has found that the accident to the Albury
mail was due to the breakage of a switch
rail in the catch-points, and the mainten-
ance ganger, the inspecting engineer, the
resident engineer and the sub-inspector
are to be “drastically reduced in status.”
Satisfied, perhaps, that it has made a
great impression, the management is
now out with a grandiose plan, not for
reconditioning the permanent way, but
for electrifying the lines between Sydney
and Newcastle. If that bubble is not
pricked, N.S.W.’s good opinion of Brux-
ner will be seriously shaken.
Victoria is at last to reform its weights-
and-measures system. Under the present
law, as expounded by Chief Sec. Mac-
farlan, scales must be kept correctly, but
a cheat can escape punishment for giv-
ing short weight or measure ; generally
speaking, it is not an offence. Instead of
apathetic municipal control, a central
administration, to be financed by fees, is
to be provided for. To a large extent the
N.S.W. Act has been copied.
Undeterred by the disastrous failure
of all Government fish-marketing experi-
ments, Queensland Labor is again coquet-
ting with the handling of Brisbane’s fish
supply. Minister Hynes talks of setting
up another board: prices are to be fixed
and fish “properly inspected and distri-
buted.” This suggests that a lot more
good money will be lost, but there should
be jobs for Government supporters while
it lasts.
Appropriate to Lindsay’s drawing on
this page is a story of a fine old poli-
tician who is still on deck. He was hav-
ing a go at the Government, and Min-
isters were leaving for refreshments.
“Luk, Misther Shpaker,” he said, “luk
at thim, lavin’ loike baboons fer the tall
timber av safety wid the natural color av
their aftherthoughts meltin’ into the blue
cerulean av a Hivin sh potted with shtars
an’ comets. Shpotted, Oi repate, wid
great big yillow shtars an’ comets an’
saffron planets.” “Order!” the Chair
interposed. “You must not say that!”
“Will, thin, and ’tis roight ye are, Misther
Shpaker,” acquiesced the orator. “ ’Tis
so yillow the rear view av them wud
be, Misther Shpaker, that ’twud be all
star-rs an’ no sky.”
Good rains in Queensland have en-
couraged stockbreeders to hang on to
their sheep and cattle, with the result
that meat prices at the saleyards are the
highest for years. Retail prices have gone
up in Sydney, but Brisbane butchers have
to sell at fixed prices; and a depu-
tation has asked Tom Ferry, the Com-
missioner of Prices, to do something. He
sparred for time with a request for
further particulars and the promise that
he will then consider the question of
decontrol.
Forgan Smith has offered the Queens-
land Police Union extra pay for
working a 48-hour week, in lieu of the
44 hours in force for trade-unionists
since July 1. Brisbane constables are
agreeable, but some of the other
branches, notably Toowoomba, object.
The Hops are to get six hours’ overtime
for the additional four hours, in addi-
tion to the full week’s pay for 44 hours.
In less advanced parts a policeman is
legally never off duty. If a Queensland
police unionist is called on in his leisure
hours to help a mate, presumably he will
charge extra overtime. Anyway, the com-
promise is going to cost Queensland
£17,510 this financial year.
Crocodile tears are being shed at the
failure of the World Economic Confer-
ence, and the moisture bears a strong
resemblance to that poured out over the
various disarmament and peace confer-
ences. The fallacy in all these schemes
for burying the hatchet is that no coun-
try goes to them with any intention of
giving up anything. Any Government
suspected of sacrificing national interests
wouldn’t live a week in a modern demo-
cracy.
Vic. Leg. Assembly is debating a bill
tc increase the borrowing powers of the
Metropolitan Board of Works, which
have been exhausted at £22,750,000. The
Government pleaded for a speedy pass-
age of the measure, so that the board
might put unemployed-relief works in
hand ; but Tunnecliffe, remarking that it
was the innocent-looking sort of scheme
which often came forward in the early
hours of the morning, said that he wasn’t
going to allow a non-representative body
which had never been economical to
enter on another orgy of mortgaging. So
the bill will not get through without a
lot of talk.
Doubtless because our Treasurers have
never thought of it, Australia has
no man-servant tax. Britain has had
one since the ’sixties; every house-
holder who keeps a man-of-all-work pot-
tering around has to ante up 15 shillings
a year. Now there is an outcry against
it; and certainly when so many are work-
less it looks queer to penalise those who
do employ men and might otherwise
employ more. Still, the exaction amounts
to only about 3|d. a week, and British
Chancellors are always reluctant to let go
anything in the nature of a class tax.
The King is to be asked to appoint
Victoria’s next Governor. Hogan has
asserted that one from overseas would
cost the taxpayer an extra £15,000 p.a.
Argyle’s reply is that a Lieut.-Gov.
costs £5605 p.a. and the imported variety
£9055.
Senator Brennan complains that the
Customs department is using, as a
matter of everyday routine, powers in-
tended for the tiding over of emer-
gencies. The ukase and the edict have
long been in fashion; a young Sydney
Barrister, Louatt, got his LL.D. the
other day with a thesis devoted to in-
stances of government by regulation in
Australia. In England the power seized
by Ministers since D.O.R.A. gave them
a thirst for despotism has been the theme
of many protests. Hewart, the Lord
Chief Justice, wrote a book about it,
and the outspoken Scrutton, J., has illu-
minated the subject with his sarcasm.
Britain has a great institution in its
Post Office. The British Post Office has
a turnover of £760,000,000, sells nearly
7,000,000,000 stamps in a year, runs a
savings bank with 5,500,000 depositors
and holdings of £300,000,000 in money
and £200,000,000 in securities, and has
all sorts of sideline departments like the
new samples section, which deals with
20,000,000 packets a year. Round about
London it delivers letters at regular
intervals from 8 a.m. till 10 p.m.—so
promptly that overseas mail can be ex-
pected at the door in metropolitan sub-
urbs two hours after it arrives at the
G.P.0., instead of 48 hours, as happens
in Mosman or Albert Park or Coorparoo.
And its operations show a surplus on last
year’s working of over £10,800,000. In
short, it is a help to the taxpayer instead
of a burden on him, as our P.M.G.’s
department generally contrives to be.

Both the first and the last bridges with
which J. J. C. Bradfield, who retires from
the N. S. Wales State Public Service, had
anything to do are arch bridges. The
first was the little overhead way which
runs over the railway line just outside
the entrance to Roma-street station in
Brisbane. Nobody disputes with him the
honor of designing it, and nobody would
have dreamt when he did design it that
he would one day be planning Sydney
Harbor bridges.
Australian girls will find Prince
George, the King’s youngest living son,
quite the beau-ideal of what a prince
should be. He is tall, more like his
father perhaps than any of his brothers,
and a very mediocre speaker compared
with the Prince of Wales, but he has all
the social qualities of the younger gen-
eration of the Windsor family. His
naval training and trips to the U.S.A.
and other countries have made him a
good mixer who is not likely to grow
pale at the sound of the Australian
accent or haughty if some simple demo-
cratic soul asks him to drop down to the
corner and have a quiet one.
Jack Warrick, for six years general
manager of the Great Boulder, and for
30 years before that underground manager,
can show some figures which look like
a record. During the period he has been
with the G.B. 4,409,0000 z. of gold has
been recovered and shareholders have re-
ceived £6,110,000 in dividends. Warrick
reached Westralia from the effete East in
the mid-’nineties. He walked most of the
way.
Eighteen years over the Stevens age-
limit, but still as mentally alert as many
a man half his age, Joel Fox has resigned
as manager of the Equity Trustee Co. He
is a Melburnian through and through.
Born in King William-street, Fitzroy, he
became a solicitor in 1868, then common-
law manager to several important legal
firms. He drew up the articles of the
JOEL FOX, who retires from the man-
agement of Equity Trustees ( Melb .)
after 46 years in the job.
Equity Trustees in 1888, and managed
the company from its inception under
a series of boards which included in their
memberships John Madden, George
Fairbairn, Hodges J., Donald Mackinnon,
Edward Mitchell, “Iceberg” Irvine and
Latham, the Commonwealth Attorney-
General.
The mild and dapper Brackley, who is
Imperial Airways’ superintendent, arrived
unobtrusively in London after the Astraea
flight. He was 12 days out from Dar-
win, and his quiet statement of his experi-
ences suggests that the days of pioneering
adventure on the London-Australia air
route are over. The only incident he
could rake up to thrill the London press
was the story of two Senators who stowed
away in Canberra and overloaded the
ship.
Philip Lindsay, the youngest of
Norman’s three sons, went to London
four years ago, married beautiful Jean
Bellon, and helped to add a bouncing
daughter named Anne Cressida to the
population of Britain. Phil read history in
the British Museum from dawn till dark,
and found publishers for three novels —
on Henry Morgan, Marlowe and Henry
PHIL LINDSAY, who has become a
literary authority on Henry VIII.
VIII., succeeding increasingly with each
new book. Following in the footsteps of
G. B. Lancaster, he has been signally
honored by having his novel on Henry
VIH. “selected” by the Book Society.
Also he has been appointed adviser to
Charles Laughton, who is producing a
movie of the Matrimonial Monarch.
Phil’s real ambition is to return to Aus-
tralia and write a book on Governor
Bligh and early Sydney.
U. R. Ellis, who will prepare the
case which the Riverina will pre-
sent before the New States Commis-
sioner, is old in political experience
although he is only in his late twenties.
His separationist tendencies were born in
him in Central Queensland, always a hot-
bed of subdivision, and survived both the
mellowing influences of education at
Brisbane Grammar School and experience
on the Sydney and Melbourne press. He
has been Earle Page’s secretary for five
years. His book on the New State move-
ment will shortly be published by the
Endeavour Press.
Patricia Hacked, daughter of news-
paper proprietor John Winthrop Hackett,
to whom W.A. owes its University, estab-
lished a South Australian precedent at
the Bar the other day when she defended
a Syrian in a murder case. Miss Pat
went at the job with all the calm of an
experienced K.C., and saved her client
from the rope. He was convicted of
manslaughter and given 12 years.
R. A. (“Dick”) Hopkins, dead in Syd-
ney at the ripe age of 87, was prominent
in old-time pastoral Queensland. For a
long time he managed Wellshot, near
Isisford, in the Barcoo country —one
of the largest runs in Queensland in his
day, and later the first in Australia to
have a road exclusively reserved for
motor traffic. In later years, till he re-
tired, he was associated with the New
Zealand-Australian Land. Co. On the
Darling Downs he was associated with
many young fellows who afterwards be-
came noted in pastoral and other walks
of life. One of them was W. H. Traill,
subsequently editor of The Bulletin.
London is wondering why Sir Ernest
Clark accepted the Governorship of Tas-
mania. He was formerly secretary to the
British Royal Commission on Income Tax
and big enough as an economic autho-
rity to be brigaded with magnates like
Sir Hugo Hirst. Whatever the reason,
Tasmania acquires one of the best finan-
cial brains in the Empire—fresh, too,
from a keying up as Permanent Secre-
tary to the Treasury of Northern Ireland,
a State in which the bawbee clings to
its private owner with extraordinary ten-
acity, and is imprisoned in an extremely
tight clutch when it falls into Govern-
ment hands.
Just-dead William Lowrie, formerly
Professor of Agriculture at Rose-
worthy (S.A.), and W.A. and S.A.
Director of Agriculture, left a legacy
of valuable knowledge to the wheat-
farmers of two States. He estab-
lished the need in S.A. of fallowing
a year ahead of seeding, and of water-
soluble phosphate dressings. Perkins, now
S.A. Director, says “no individual did
more to make S.A. farming payable.”
Lowrie, who was born in Galashiels
(Scotland), in 1857, was a rare example
of a teacher of farming becoming a
farmer. He retired to his own property
at Echunga, where he grew wheat and
bred Border Leicesters. He refused the
Chair of Agriculture at Sydney Univer-
sity in 1909. A sister married Newton
Moore, M.P., ex-Premier of Westralia.
Dr. A. Grenfell Price is doing good
unofficial publicity work for Australia in
the U.S.A. during his lectures at leading
universities. Price became principal of
St. Mark’s College in the University of
Adelaide after taking his M.A. with
first honors at Oxford, where he was in
Magdalen. In spite of heavy collegiate
duties, he finds time for authorship—
his “Causal Geography of the World”
ran to seven editions. He is an associate
member of the Australian National
Research Council, and is something of an
athlete.
Nobody acquainted with P. J. O’Shea
could fail to recognise him from this pic-
ture, though the artist has caught him in a
solemn moment. Normally, his immacu-
late felt hat and his cheery smile seem
to be part of him. At one time he and
his brother had about the largest prac-
tice in the northern State, but this was
no bar to the social side of their lives.
No Q.T.C. meeting for 40 years was
reckoned complete without them if they
were in Brisbane, and P.J. bred horses ;
he is still a Q.T.C. committeeman. He

is a very real patron to the Great
Public Schools Rowing Club, his special
interest in the youngsters deriving
from the fact that he learnt his own
rowing at Brisbane Grammar. His father
was a great figure in the dairying industry
and owned one of the finest Jersey studs
in the State.
James Espie, dead in Adelaide at 70,
was a leading sharebroker in the Kal-
goorlie boom days, his firm being Silver
and Espie. Before that, and again after-
wards, he was secretary of the Adelaide
Stock Exchange.

cession to the late H. A. Curtis. It is
not his first essay on the Tasmanian job
—he was associated with the construc-
tion of the multiple-arch dam which pro-
vided the original power source in the
Great Lake section.
R. J. Rudall, the Gawler lawyer, who
has become one of the members for
Barossa (S.A.), is following in the foot-
steps of his father, S. B. Rudall, who won
Barossa in 1906 after having been defeated
in 1905. RJ. was an Adelaide Rhodes
scholar and collected the degree of
Bachelor of Literature at Oxford for a
thesis on “The Founding of South Aus-
tralia.” On returning to S.A. he went
into his father’s legal practice at
Gawler, where he has remained ever
since, except for three years in France
with the 50th Battalion, in which he
finished as a captain and an assistant-
director of the A.I.F. educational scheme.
He lectures at the University on consti-
tutional law.
After 53 years on the roof and box
old Bill Edwin Lee, who was probably
the most aristocratic cabman in the
world, recently retired. Bom in 1858, at
Port Fairy (Vic.), he is a son of the late
Dr. Joseph Lee, who practised in London
and Auckland. His mother was a niece
of the Duchess of Gordon, while his
grand-uncle, Sir George Gunning, led the
First Dragoons at Waterloo. The veteran
was a lad of 12 when he shipped aboard
the Glengarry as a cabin boy, and for
the following ten years travelled the
world in various ships, one being the
Canopus, which caught fire in the Indian
Ocean. Lee was one of the crew who
drifted for 13 days in an open boat.
Subsequently he was wrecked in the
schooner Prince Arthur, off the Maori-
land coast, and was later employed
on the barque Williams when that vessel
rescued the survivors of the ill-fated
Dandenong. He was the first man to
drive a rubber-tyred hansom in Victoria.
After half a century’s service as a
Government official H. R. Way, Com-
monwealth electoral officer for Vic., will
retire in September. He joined the Vic-
torian Postal Department in 1883, pass-
ing to the Federal service at the open-
ing of the century. Since 1914 he has
been in the electoral branch. He was
divisional R.O. in three Vic. constituen-
cies and electoral officer in W.A. before
he was appointed to his present job in
1930.

The Victorian pup handed on 2} p.c.,
but the Queensland and W.A. subsidi-
aries have declared nothing to date of
accounts. Of the parent’s funds, £82,200
is represented by these inter-State off-
shoots, and £70,000 of the reserves in
the introductory table came from the
sale of trade-marks and goodwill. Last
year £12,000 was written off the holding
in the Vic. subsidiary, which hacked off
Bs. per £ of its capital.
As to the parent, it still has a strong
grip on whatever business there is to be
had in N. S. Wales, and considering the
semi-luxury nature of its products, last
year’s declared profit (£32,266, up £9487)
is indicative of careful management.
However, the unexplained addition
(£19,434) to “general, taxation and de-
preciation reserves, £465,044,” was
£13,048 lighter, so that the year’s appa-
rent improvement may not be all it
looks.
Boom-time expansion sent paid capi-
tal from £150,000 to £425,835 by par
issues. The new money and most of the
surplus earnings were invested in prem-
ises and efficient plant, which are now
in excess of trade requirements. But the
reserve mixture quoted above is £893
in excess of the book value of all plant,
and investments are cared for by another
specific lay-by of £47,565. The intro-
ductory table takes in all reserves and
p. and 1. balance, less goodwill (£25,250) ;
the position would be much clearer if
what the board has earmarked for de-
preciation was shown separately.
Though it has shown practically no
increase over the past two years, plant
has been kept in “the very best possible
condition and repair” :

tinguished. Cash amounting to £28,389
was distributed in this operation. Though
the fall of £8742 in debtors (now only
£8859) last term indicates trade slackness,
it also means small chance of bad debts.
Stocks are high at £23,954 (up £10,463).
The more or less liquid surplus (£68,923)
was £9955 stronger, allowing for the re-
turn of capital.
The final div. was at the rate of
7}d. per share, as against an interim of
6d. The 7.8 p.c. averaged over the term
is reduced to 4.5 p.c. to the buyer who
paid 245. for the scrip. Including depre-
ciation, etc., reserve, the net tangible
backing is 445. 6d. per £1 of capital.
Being mainly plant, it is worth what it
can earn.

1933.. 34,105 8 „ „ 24,133 9,972 227,815
The position is snug, and the steady 8
p.c. is free of income tax, excepting the
unemployment-relief impost. The man-
agement has never been talkative;
hence the disclosure last year of
£86,000 previously tucked away in inner
reserves came as a surprise. The co. was
formed by the Carpenters in 1914, and
it quietly built up a sound Island
trading and finance business, concentrat-
ing principally in New Guinea and the
Solomons.
Until slump knocked copra prices to
the lowest recorded level (£lO last year),
it was the invariable practice to put by
more of the disclosed earnings than was
distributed. Over the past three years the
margin over 8 p.c. has narrowed —last
year’s net profit was equal to 11.3 p.c.
on capital compared with 11.1, 12.5, 14.6,
20 and 19 p.c. back to 1928. The year’s
£1786 improvement in gross profits
(£45,354) seems to have been mainly due
to merchandising activities on the gold-
fields ; the co. started its own aeroplane
service between Salamoa and Wau last
January, and freight costs were reduced
substantially. To the close of accounts
500,0001 b. of merchandise was carried.
Altogether results have been remark-
able, the returns on the new capital put
up by shareholders, who have trebled
their stake in the business over the past
decade, being astonishing. Visible re-
serves stand at £227,815, and the chair-
man gave his assurance that the inner
strength brought to light in 1932 was
over and above ample provision for con-
tingencies. The outlook for the current
year remains uncertain, but the directors
say the co. will be able to hold its
position.
To reduce costs the co. has been re-
placing its steamers with . small Diesel-
driven vessels, with satisfactory results.
Two recent additions to the fleet are
reflected by a growth of £12,000 in the
book value of shipping property since
1931: —•

The co. invested part of its spare cash
in plantations, etc. ; they were purchased
at “bedrock values.” These deals and the
cost of two De Havilland ’planes are re-
flected by a growth of £23,242 in “branch
balances,” an item which is more elastic
than specific, movements therein not
being of much significance to outsiders.
Investments (£127,698, up £7041) include
the co.’s interest in its Solomon Islands
subsidiary, whose £112,000 of ordinary
capital the parent largely controls. The
pup paid 6 p.c. on its ords., as usual.
With only £15,501 of disclosed liabili-
ties, covered more than twice over by
cash, the parent’s position is very com-
fortable. Branch balances, of course,
may include other commitments, and
much depends upon the soundness of
book debts covered up under this blan-
ket. But the board is not the kind to
overlook much when providing for pos-
sible losses.
Visible backing for the shares is 355.
per £1 of capital. The scrip stands at
425. on ’Change; it stuck around 28s.
for years, but mounted rapidly over the
past 12 months. Returns at the current
price is 3.8 p.c.

The 5 p.c. was a comfortable matter
after striking off £3OOO more than was
spent on fixed assets and charging con-
siderable renewals, etc., to revenue. Only
taxation actually paid was debited up,
but there is a reserve of £8750, not in-
cluded in the introductory table, to cover
future assessments, if necessary. Trad-
ing profits (£15,798) were only £2647
better, but taxes paid (£2276) were £2070
lighter, largely due to adjustments which
will not be available next term ; thus the
net figure improved £4717, being equal
to 6.4 p.c. on capital, compared with 4.9,
3.7 and 11.4 p.c. in the three preceding
years.
Trading improved in every depart-
ment, but was spasmodic. The Bridge
has affected the bar trade ; though it is
taxed for the upkeep of this expensive
utility the co. is a loser by its diversion
of traffic. Hopes are for an increase
in profits during the current year —mod-
ernisation of the old building is still going
on —but the only certain thing in the
outlook is that next year’s taxation bill
will be heavier.
The £3022 of the year’s profit carried
to reserves lifted them to £68,203 ; in
1932 the chairman hinted that part of
the lay-by may be earmarked to write
down properties. The latter are being
maintained in good condition, and figure
at £305,317 in the accounts:

Finances are comfortable, the debt
(£20,092) having been steadily reduced
over the past few years. A new wing
was added to the building about five
years ago, making accommodation avail-
able for 500. The additions were mainly
financed by raising £60,000 of new capi-
tal, which brought in £15,573 of share
premiums.
The market, satisfied with the pros-
pects, notes particularly that the interest
bill is light and prices the scrip at 255.
The return is 4 p.c. on a 5 p.c. div. basis,
and the backing 265. 6d. in net tangibles.

This, on appearances, is one of the most
favored gas cos. in the Commonwealth.
but that 13 p.c. div. is not all it seems.
It is worth no more than 6.1 p.c. on
the average auction price (£lO 10s. 3d.)
of all shares sold by the co. during the
last 55 years. In the circumstances, the
market considers the co. reasonably safe
from legislative interference, and prices
the £5 shares at £13 —they were never
higher— at which figure the return is
5 p.c.
The co.’s charge for gas has been re-
duced from a maximum of 7s. 6d. per
1000 c.f. a couple of years ago to an
average of about 6s. 2d. last half-year.
But, as a result of the times and of com-
petition from the Electricity Commis-
sion, sales have not responded, and
overhead has made itself felt, as this
analysis of sales and exes, clearly shows':

Exes, over the last two half-years include
two allocations of £20,000 each to help
pay for alterations to the co.’s Flinders-
street freehold. A drop of 68 million
c.f. last half in the total gas sold (1,855
million c.f.) is largely seasonal.
Net profit was £12,863 lighter at
£95,517, but the 13 p.c. was a comfort-
able matter, and after charging to re-
venue £9BOl spent on plant, £1216 was
carried to reserves (£961,028, including
£819,201 of share premiums). No specific
allowance is made for depreciation;
much therefore depends upon whether
expenditure upon repairs and renewals
(£153,503 during the last half) proves
sufficient. It has not been enough to
cover obsolescence, on account of which
£173,486 was struck off during the 34-
years to June 30, 1931.
Like other gas cos., the Metropolitan
is a large borrower on debentures. In-
cluding £500,000 costing 8 p.c., total in-
debtedness under this head was
£1,997,300 at June 30. During the six
months to that date £19,061 was spent
on new buildings and plant, and £39,802
was written off old machinery con-
demned as obsolete. The book value of
the undertaking now stands at £3,952,523,
and sundry creditors total £272,097. Cash,
investments and book debts total
£462,287 ; stocks and stores, £200,116.

The co. received 3645 less bales of wool
(113,545 bales); sales (118,084 bales) were
4473 lighter. But it is still Brisbane’s
leading broker. Considering that only
13 years have elapsed since the co. took
over John Bridge’s Queensland business
these figures are remarkable:

over for the time being. Profits available
for shareholders and reserves were thus
£2751 lighter in respect of the term to
June 30 last. The distribution to share-
holders was lowered to 6 p.c., and £3034
was carried to reserves (£35,817).
Clients have done very well in the
past. Out of profits shareholders are
entitled to the first 7 p.c. ; then clients
begin to benefit. The business, very
soundly managed, forged ahead rapidly.
By 1926 branches had been opeiied at
Rockhampton and Longreach, next year
activities spread to Charleville, and a
further outpost was established in Towns-
ville in 1932.
Over the past seven years the co. has
put on £120,053 of capital (now £234,712,
up £4939 last term). Most of the new
money and borrowings from outsiders
went into advances, which mounted
£201,364 over the five years to 1931:

Last term the co.’s debt (£424,112, in-
cluding provision for taxation) jumped
£159,277; but £199,137 was in respect
of advance payments by wool buyers, and
against this £124,368 was held liquid at
the bank. Advances to clients, etc.,
(£412,065) moved up £39,885 during the
year. In 1931, in order to cope with
business, a new woolstore was put up
at Bulimba. After a growth of £43,405
in freeholds that term, there has been
a reduction of £2939 over the past two
years.
Advances are nearly all in wool liens,
a good class of security. The board is
more hopeful of the industry during the
current year; good rains have fallen
over most Queensland pastoral areas, and
the outlook for prices is brighter.
North Kalgurli, which has announced
in the one breath a sixpenny div. and
an increase in capital by £25,000 to
£lOO,OOO, is breaking ounce stone over
a width of Bft. in stopes above the 366 ft.
level. In a winze below the 700 ft. level
lOdwt. material has been proved for 52ft.
On the 962 ft. level the lode is 14ft. wide,
assaying 10-13dwt. It is a great pity that
such rich ore is to be treated at the rate
of only 5000 tons monthly when the
Boulder Perseverance plant is duplicated.
The mine could easily deliver 20,000 tons.
An ultra-conservative policy never reaped
rich rewards in mining.

On the Moonlight leases at Wiluna,
which are being developed by Goldfields
Australian Development Co., in which
W. S. Robinson and Colin Fraser are
the moving spirits, four prospecting
shafts are being sunk and two diamond
drills are operating continuously. Two
lodes, one 3+ft. wide, assaying 225., and
the other, 7ft. wide, worth 385., were
recently located. These are believed to
be the continuation over a distance of
4500 ft. of the Wiluna No. 2 West lode.
The Swedish Co. is carrying out an elec-
trical prospecting survey. The Moon-
light yielded 50,000 tons of lldwt. ore
in the early days, but treatment was a
difficulty then. Shareholders in Gold-
fields Co. include Consolidated Gold-
fields of S’Africa and the Transvaal
Agency. Capital is £300,000.

Granites Development, a Melbourne
co., will shortly commence unwatering
the Dark Horse at Wiluna. There is
supposed to be 10,000 tons of lOdwt. ore
ready for stoping below the water level.
The co. has also pegged a lease
at Misima, New Guinea. To a depth of
60ft. this lode is 10ft. wide, assaying
lldwt. There are good facilities for
transport, mining and milling.

From London: Recent rise in Wilunas,
first attributed to a probable early div.
and a substantial increase in ore reserves,
is now said to be partly due to a pos-
sible new issue. Wiluna Gold Corpora-
tion operates through Wiluna Gold
Mines, the latter a co. registered jin
Westralia which has a share capital
of £BOO,OOO and a note issue of £275,000
in 6 p.c. seven-year notes. The Corp.
owns the entire share capital of the
Westralian co. Some of the notes of
Wiluna Gold Mines have been repaid,
and now the suggestion is that Wiluna
Gold Corp. may elect this month to re-
deem the balance (£200,000), financing
the operation by a new issue of its own
shares at a price which would compare
attractively with current quotations.

South Kalgurli shareholders are to get
back another 2s. 6d. a share. Co.’s
accounts to March last showed a profit
of £82,556, after deducting the shilling
interim div. Balance of the property
account was written off, and a final div. of
Is. 6d. and special bonus of 2s. 6d. a
share were paid on July 25. Co. unex-
pectedly struck telluride ore the other
day at depth in the Croesus Prop.
Block. Croesus is at the extreme north
end of the Golden Mile, and is
being worked by the South Kalgurli on
a profit-sharing basis with the owner.
North Kalgurli, Ltd. Apart from its
prospective value in the Croesus block
the strike is important inasmuch as it
is in calc schist, hitherto regarded by
geologists as unfavorable to payability
or permanency. If these experts can be
confounded, further work will be done
on a hitherto neglected portion of the
field. South Kalgurli has just acquired
five 24-acre blocks south of the Lake
View, and means to spend £5OOO in
boring.

Gt. Boulder’s net profit from gold pro-
duction last year was £70,950, and from
the sale of a parcel of Wiluna shares
£7463. Two threepenny (sterling) divs..
less English income tax, were paid, and
a similar interim for the current year
was handed out on July 14. Balance
sheet shows a large excess of cash assets
over liabilities. Ore reserves, actual and
probable, show on the basis of present
output about six years’ work for the
mill. A profit of at least £200,000 is
expected from the treatment of old
dumps. Directors state on the authority
of Trewartha James, who visited the mine
some months ago, that a saving of
£48,000 a year in the cost of dealing with
144,000 tons will be effected when the
new plant is in operation. Mention is
made of the part local director Dick
Hamilton played in the rejection of Lake
View’s offer to buy the Boulder mine.

Sons of Gwalia’s latest annual report
contains some information regarding the
ore reserves, which, it is estimated, are
now equal to about three years’ supply,
grade being about 30s. a ton with gold
at 85s, Though shareholders were de-
prived of larger divs. for a while in order
that the loan of £76,132 from the State
Government might be repaid, they re-
ceived Is. 6d. a share last year, and, with
the maintenance of prices, they may look
forward to 35., perhaps 45., during
the current year. Because of the interest
taken by the Westralian Government in
the welfare of the Gwalia mine, the
board is conducting exploratory work on
two promising areas on the eastern fields.

On the Phoenix, Norseman (W.A.), a
crosscut on No. 6 level has shown 30in.
of ore assaying 20dwt. On the No. 7
level a winze is being sunk in 13dwt. ore.
Several working places are available for
stoping above the No. 6 level, where the
shoot is payable over a length of 400 ft.
* * * *
On North Kalgurli Central a lode
has been met in a crosscut 300 ft. from
the 400 ft. level. At a distance of 250 ft.
in the crosscut a formation assaying
6dwt. has been driven on for 7ft. The
co. has a capital of £30,000; its lease of
22 acres is a mile n.-e. of Great Boulder.

Princess Royal’s latest fortnightly
clean-up was 181 oz. The winze below
No. 5 level is improving with depth ; the

The Kunanalling Gold Co. crushed 33
tons from the Melva Maie lease recently
for 102 oz. over the plates. This lease
has returned several rich parcels since
the present co. took over last November.

district the company has started break-
ing ore.

Prospects of Hawkwood Gold Mines
(C.Q.) are greatly improved by striking
of the ore-shoot in the 100 ft. south level.
The drive is in 7ft. ore making to 16in.,
and backs now look a certainty to the
surface. At grass 130 tons of good ore
is ready for crushing.

Cairns at last has two goldfields that
look likely to stick. Kamerunga is a
large lode averaging sft. over a quarter-
mile length, but crushings have run only
sto 8 ’weights. It is cheap mining ;
there is a local mill, and about 6dwt.
should pay. Mt. Peter still sends high-
grade ore to Chillagoe Smelters, this com-
ing from the Talisman, but the big low-
grade Peter is worked only occasionally.
The local mill has been a handicap to
the field and a cause of disagreement
amongst the miners.

The Wonbah (Q.) molybdenite pipe is
again being worked in a small way. The
pipe was premier producer in Queens-
land for several years, and the owners
are hanging on while negotiating for
capital to explore the bottom level and
erect a plant. When concentrates touched
50s. a unit it was thought to have sound
speculative interest, but the price is now
445., and financiers are not rushing the
metal.

Great Northern Tin, Herberton (N.Q.),
the mine that had the biggest tin pipes
on the field, has pegged away for the
last three years with great consistency
but without luck. It is now follow-
ing a low-grade body down towards
700 ft. depth, getting nice small patches
but nothing permanent, and on present
indications dividends are not likely
till luck changes. Small crushings of
5 p.c. to 10 p.c. ore have been the order
lately, but the last big pipe returned over
£50,000 of tinstone. Of the other shows
the Canberra is turning out high-grade
ore, but the Wild Irishman, lately re-
opened after lying idle for years, does
not seem to have picked up the lost shoot
of ore.

United Options, which is developing
a property at Reid’s Creek, Queensland,
has sunk three shafts and carried out a
considerable amount of driving. No. i
shaft, 61ft. deep, and a drive 15ft. near
the bottom have been in ore assaying
l|oz. No. 2 shaft, 900 ft. east, and of
similar depth, has proved ore carrying
lfoz. No. 3 is 18ft. deep at present, and
in high-grade ore. The lode averages
6ft. wide, and has been exposed by
trenching for 2000 ft.

Queensland Government has been con-
sidering the report on lead-poisoning at
Mt. Isa, and has agreed to pay compen-
sation to employees affected. The re-
port submitted by Dr. J. V. Duhig recom-
mended the appointment of a medical
board to investigate all claims for com-
pensation, the chairman to be permanently
at Isa. Complete elimination of lead-
poisoning will probably be a lengthy and
expensive job. Experience at Port Pirie,
where at one time there was a lot of lead-
poisoning, should be a great help.

On the True Blue, at Yarrol (Q.), a
party is engaged in sinking six shafts on
new reefs; they range from 6in. to
6ft. in width, and assay from Bdwt. to
3oz. A recent crushing at Chillagoe of
8| tons gave 19i0z., valued at £l4B. The
gold being won is high-grade, running
from 86 p.c. to 90 p.c. fine. A small
ball-mill and pumping plant are being
erected.

Golden Treasure, once the Limonite,
on the old Gilberton goldfield (N.Q.), has
crushed two parcels aggregating 16 tons
from the underlie for 123y0z. gold and

£lOOO. The reef is 14in. thick. Several
other promising claims are being worked
in the vicinity, and Commonwealth
Mines Preliminary Syndicate, which
holds a 15,000-acre lease on the field, is
sinking a series of trial shafts. On the
Rocky field the Victory recently crushed

SHADOW SHOWS.
“Cabin in the Cotton,” at the Regent,
just misses being one of the outstanding
films of the year. It is spoiled by
obvious stage-sets and an unnecessary
love interest.
The theme is the enmity between
America’s lordly cotton planters and
their miserable tenant farmers. The
planters are, in the eyes of the “poor
whites,” a set of tyrannical scoundrels
rolling in sweated wealth ; in the eyes of
the planters the “poor whites” are a loaf-
ing, thieving and incendiary collection
of degenerates.
Richard Barthelmess is the son of a
“poor white” who, on the death of his
father, is patronised by one of the
planters (Berton Churchill). Churchill
sends him to school and later employs
him in his store, to which all of Church-
ill’s tenants are hopelessly in debt, due to
exorbitant charges and faking of the
accounts. While he is Churchill’s trusted
confidant, he is also a confessor into
whose ears his own people pour their
tales of woe and misdeeds against the
planter.
Barthelmess is torn from both sides.
He doesn’t wish to appear ungrateful
to his employer, yet his natural sympa-
thies are for the underdogs. His boyhood
sweetheart (Dorothy Jordan), a ragged,
pinched-face little maiden, and Church-
ill’s daughter (Bette Davis), a pampered
but lovely shrew, complicate matters.
A lynching on the part of the planters,
arson on a grand scale by the “poor
whites,” a threat by the “poor whites”
to kill Barthelmess, and Barthelmess’s
discovery that Churchill had swindled his
father bring matters to a head.
The climax is a get-together meeting
at which Barthelmess suddenly becomes
articulate, berates both sides, and exhorts
them to co-operate. His miraculous
acquisition of a dominating personality
is unconvincing, but it makes for an
emotional ending.
Barthelmess is too old for the part, but
he is effective otherwise. There are no
complaints with regard to the other
members of the cast.
“The Little Damozel,” at the Plaza, is
a melodrama fedeemed by good acting
and better directing than has been seen in
an English film for a long time. James
Rennie, sharper, has known better days
financially and socially. He frequents
the Cafe Angelique, whose cabaret star,
Anna Neagle (“The Little Damozel”),
loves him unrequitedly. Comes the vil-
lain Athole Stewart with an offer of
£15,000 if he will marry Anna. The lady
whom Athole wants to marry loved
James in the long ago, and in this type
of play fashionable girls remain true even
to insolvents. -
The climax arrives when Anna finds
out why she was married and leaves
James for ever, though by now he wor-
ships her as much as she does him.
James Rennie doesn’t talk like a
member of the class he is supposed to
have belonged to—a sign of bad staff
work somewhere. The last thing an Eng-
lish wrong ’un parts with is his public-
school voice ; in fact, as a rule, he tends
to accentuate it as he descends in the
world. Anna Neagle is completely right,
both as a vulgar vaudevillienne with a
preposterous blonde coiffure and a trucu-
lent manner, and as a woman whose de-
fences go down when she is happily
mated. The cafe scenes and modernist
flat interiors are equal to anything of the
sort done by Hollywood, and there isn’t
a false note in the brisk, up-to-date dia-
logue.
“No Funny Business” is a bedroom
farce, with some amusing lines and situa-
tions and two or three songs for May-
fair’s idol, Gertrude Lawrence. A victim
of jealousy, she puts a beautiful girl-
detective on to her husband (or, rather,
Potterton’s Agency does it for her, and
she is much annoyed when she
discovers how good-looking the girl is),
and the husband puts an exquisitely-
tailored young man-detective on to her.
But it is the detectives who do the love-
making, and, after the usual wavings of
underclothes and dashings from bed to
bed, all misunderstandings are happily
cleared up.
Miss Lawrence has a rather thin part,
but it enables her to show once more
what a fine light-comedy artist she is.

As a conscientious attempt to demon-
strate that America has successfully
divorced itself from morals of any sort,
“The Billion Dollar Scandal,” at the
Capitol, has many points of interest.
Hero (Robert Armstrong) is the ex-con-
vict Fingers Partas. While celebrating his
release from gaol, the car in which he
is being driven by a drunken flapper
collides with that of a millionaire finan-
cier (Frank Morgan). Fingers gets a job
as masseur to the millionaire, and his
young brother falls in love with the mil-
lionaire’s dipsomaniacal daughter Doris
(Constance Cummings). He listens in on
the millionaire’s private conversation, and
gets market tips of which he makes good
use until the millionaire finds out and
ruins and fires him. For revenge, he
spills the beans about the great oil scan-
dal. He survives attacks on his life by a
professional murderer (Sidney Toler), and
brings about the downfall of the million-
aire and his associates, but when he goes
to the editor who has used his informa-
tion and claims his reward he is told that
there’s “nothing so cold as yesterday’s
news.” That’s the fade-out.
if anybody put such stuff forward as
a picture of national life in England,
or Australia, or Kamchatka, there’d be
trouble, but the U.S.A. seems to be differ-
ent. The story is, of course, founded

tT talkie version of Peg oMy
He ft at the Lyceum has been garnished
Wlth tuneful songs and nice voices, and
Top: James Rennie, Anna Neagle and Alfred Drayton in “The Little Damozel” at
Sydney Plaza. BOTTOM: Warren Hymer, Bob Armstrong and James
Gleason in “The Billion Dollar Scandal,” and James Dunn in “Hold Me
Tight,” both at Sydney Capitol.
Marion Davies, as Peg, mimics the Irish
brogue prettily. The cast is ideal, and
the story ripples along so smoothly that
there’s no occasion to challenge its proba-
bility. The director has put the soft
pedal on the pathos, yet there were quite
a lot of hankies absorbing feminine tears
at the premiere.
Mexico in 1848 is the setting for “The
Man from Monterey,” at the Haymarket,
and John Wayne is given the chance,
when sent there on a mission by the U.S.
army, to look stunning as a Cabal-
lero. He meets a lovely senorita, and in
the final bust-up, which is a feature of all
his pictures, he displays his well-known
virtuosity as a swordsman. Nor has the
director omitted to provide a fat part for
John’s horse.
During the filming of “The Death
Kiss” at Hollywood the star is murdered.
Suspicion falls on Adrienne Ames, de-
ceased’s divorced wife. The audience
knows she is guiltless, and so does David
Manners, hero, but things look black for
an exciting half-hour or more. It was
rather foolish of David not to appre-
hend the villain before he had time to
suicide —and David seemed such a bright
young man, too.
Sundry Shows
Peter Dawson has decided to stay in
Sydney till the end of the week, the pub-
lic having shown no sign of wearying
of his singing. “I Travel the Road” and
ditties of that ilk are still hailed with
rapturous tumult, but Mr. Dawson
manages to sandwich in some of the
classics. On Saturday night he declaimed
“The Trumpet Shall Sound” (with organ
and trumpet) and “The Erl-King,” two
fine efforts, and for extra variety threw
in Moussorgsky’s “Song of the Flea” and
Leslie Stuart’s “Bandolero.” Tapia-Cabal-
lero, after demonstrating his contempt
for Chopin in a performance of the B
Flat Minor Sonata that defied all pre-
cedents, went back to his beloved De-
bussy, Granados, Albeniz and De Falla
with an almost audible sigh of relief.

Melbourne would have gained a better
impression of the Isobel Elsom co. at
Melb. King’s if it had introduced itself
per medium of “Private Lives,” which
happened on Saturday. It is a wildly
amusing farce which only needed the
touch of the Shakspeare to whom Noel
Coward is frequently compared to be-
come a brilliant comedy. Master Noel
may be described as a playwright who
observes the How of Life without under-
standing the Why. Two people get
divorced, marry again, accidentally meet
on the first night of their respective
honeymoons, revive the old quarrelsome
affection and bolt from their new spouses.
As regards the acting, a company of
archangels could hardly have improved
on the spoilt-beauty voluptuousness of
Isobel Elsom, the tired Don Juanism of
George Barraud, the pomposity of
Harvey Adams and Charlotte France’s
exhaustingly animated good woman. The
final quarrel between the two last-named
established a record in high-speed vitu-
peration. Curtain-raiser “Op-o’-Me-
Thumb” was an engaging bit of Cockney
fantasy, best remembered for the per-
formance of local Agnes Doyle as a
laundry girl whose mental mansion is
papered throughout with sixpenny novel-
ette wrappers.

Three sable heads bent over a ’cello,
a violin and a piano respectively at Mel-
bourne Town Hall last week and drew'
out of them such a harmonious concord
of sweet sounds as Melbourne had not
heard for a long time. The melodious
Schubert trio, op. 99, was an impressive
demonstration of teamwork, in which
Tossy Spivakovsky’s violin was never at
odds with brother Jascha’s piano or
friend Kurtz’s ’cello. Tossy’s solo appear
ances caused most excitement. His play-
ing of the Preludium e Allegro of Pug-
nani-Kreisler was an exhibition of first-
class musicianship ; he cracked a musi-
cal joke by Rimsky-Korsakov very
neatly; but all that can be said about
his serving of the sea-pie from “Carmen”
is that now we know he can do it. There
was a brilliant programme on Saturday,
there will be another this afternoon and
a fourth to-morrow evening.
* * *
Madame Orff-Solscher, whose first per-
formance of herself and her newly-con-
stituted choir took place at the Central
Hall, Melbourne, shows a preference for
the not-so-well-known Schubert songs,
which she sings with exquisite artistry.
Instead of the mawkishness with which
that dead and defenceless composer is
usually presented she emphasises all that
was living and significant about him.
Ernst Wilson and Freda Northcote gave
good voices to their solos but showed
a tendency to drag. The choir was ener-
getically hustled out of the same ten-
dency, and its singing was excellent,
especially in the “Fairy Queen” part.
Brahms was almost the sole subject
for discussion on the agenda paper of the
Sisserman string quartette at the Melb.
Assembly Hall last week, and a large
house listened to some delightful play-
ing. With Henri Penn at the piano the
combination essayed the lovely quartette,
op. 25, and brought out a great deal of
its charm and gaiety. In the sonata for
’cello and piano, op. 99, Sisserman was
more declamatory than subtle, but in the
final quartette, op. 51, the four displayed
their teamwork almost to perfection.
There is no better bow or more painstak-
ing artist in Melbourne than the leader of
this organisation, which looks like the
nearest thing to an orchestra Melbourne
is likely to have this winter.

Daphne Cockburn, a young Queens-
lander with a formidable string of letters
after her name, gave a demonstration of
her powers as a pianist at Sydney Con.
Hall last week, on the eve of her de-
parture to pursue her studies abroad.
Miss Cockburn, who is not yet 20, has
been playing in public for 15 years, and
her confidence and courage are superb.
Bach flows from her fingers with facility,
Beethoven and Liszt with gusto, and
Brahms with assurance. She commands
a full, rich, warm tone, and deals
out broad effects in a manner reminiscent
of Hambourg. There is plenty to quarrel
with in her interpretations, but they have
fire and life, and that’s more promising
than milk-and-water correctness.

The orchestra at the Sunday afternoon
concert at Sydney Town Hall was under
the baton ,of Andrew MacCunn, who
steered his band through the “Flying
Dutchman” overture in a manner that
showed he hasn’t allowed his long pro-
fessional devotion to light music to im-
pair his appreciation of Wagnerian dra-
matics. Frank Sale (of the “Music in the
Air” co.) sang Siegmund’s love song from
‘Valkyrie,” and followed it with Handel’s
“Silent Worship,” both very impressively
delivered. Marie Bremner’s light soprano
was well suited to an aria from “Figaro.”
The organ, under the hands and feet of
Ernest Truman, sweetly pealed forth the
Rimsky-Korsakov “Song of India,” the
Easter hymn from “Cavalleria Rusti-
cana” and one of the organist’s own com-
positions, an Adagio in E Major.
If “The Quaker Girl” is on its last
legs at Melb. Royal, the legs are still
worth viewing. Magician Chefalo will
make his final disappearance from the
Palace stage on Saturday, but the box-
office barometer is still set fair for
“Tout Paris” at the Princess.

Armed with a handful of press-tickets
the Showman made a grand tour of Syd-
ney’s amateur shows on Saturday even-
ings. He discovered half a dozen in full
swing, and doubtless there were others.
A peep through the doors of the Savoy
Theatre revealed that Doris Fitton’s In-
dependent Players had got away to time
in Moss Hart and George Kaufmann’s
“Once in a Lifetime,” a satire on Holly-
wood.
At St. James’s Hall in Phillip-street the
Players’ Club was staging James Bridie’s
“Tobias and the Angel.” The author,
who is a Scots physician, has taken the
story told in the Book of Tobit in the
Apocrypha and made a plain-sailing dra-
matic transcription. The dialogue has
been modernised, and is droll and witty.
Producer Jack Appleton seems to have
made an excellent job.
At Bryant’s Playhouse Sutro’s gay
comedy “Uncle Anyhow” was well on
its way. Joan Hayman was making the
best of her part as a bad-tempered, inter-
fering old aristocrat, and Beryl Davie
and Kit Dewar were delightful as the
sisters.
At the Tom Thumb Theatre in King-
street the Australian Theatre Society was
getting towards the tail-end of a pro-
gramme of four morality plays by Dulcie
Deamer. Miss Deamer had cleverly
linked each play up with the others, and
the dialogue represented her at her
brightest. Noela Marienthal, Alwyn
Samuels and Vern and Mona Cunning-
ton were among the stars of the evening.

ABORIGINALITIES
“Tenrag”: Henare, from up-country,
was a regular visitor to Dunedin public
library. Every day he went to the same
shelf, took out the same book, opened
it at the same page and burst into peals
of laughter. This aroused the attendants’
curiosity to such an extent that one day
one of them peeped over Henare’s
shoulder and saw the picture of a bull
chasing a little boy. Henare was chuck-
ling : “Py korry, he ain’t caught him yet.”
!fc * ' * SC
“Bush Loafer”: Awakened by a fren-
zied clucking from the fowl-run I seized
my shotgun and went out to investigate.
I found a Black Orpington hen edging
her way along the netted fence in a
seemingly drunken manner. She had a
grey, furry thing on her neck, which I
made out to be a brush-tailed bush rat.
As I watched it became clear that the
rodent was driving the hen. The rat had
its hind feet snug at the base of the
hen’s neck, on the back of which its
body was stretched so that it was able
to clamp a forepaw over each eye.
It seemed to be nibbling at the back of
“McTavish drinks like a fish.”
“Yes—never been heard to shout”
the bird’s head to urge her along to the
gate, which was nearly closed, but had
enough space between it and the post
for the rat to get its mount through,
which it did cleverly. It then guided the
hen along a bush track with many loud
protests from the stupid thing, who could
have shaken her incubus off with half
the energy she wasted in squawking.
They stopped at the foot of a big dry
tree. The rat, lifting its snout, gave vent
to a piercing squeal, and five little rats
clambered down from a hollow limb.
The whole performance was explained.
Mother rat had brought victuals, on the
hoof, as it were, to her offspring, who
were now invited to come down and
fasten on to the hen’s jugular. At that
stage I let fly with my shotgun, the hen
escaped in the subsequent flurry, and so
did mother rat and two of her children.
* * * *
“Bioko”: She came over to ask if her
husband could have the loan of my hay-
rake, and proceeded to tell me of her
brother-in-law’s illness. “You know,” she
said, “he had terrible pains in his stum-
mick and awful giddiness in his head,
and he went to every doctor in town, but
none of them did him a bit of good.
Then, at last, he tried a Chinese herbalist.
The herbalist got a bit of raw meat
and held it to my brother-in-law’s nose,
and, after a while, out came a great, big,
long, white worm. The Chinaman ex-
plained that this worm used to crawl
up into my brother-in-law’s brains and
then down into his stummick, and this
was the cause of all his trouble. He is
well as any man now.” So now I know
something about the way miracles are
managed.

“E.S.”: Bricky had no schooling, but
he could draw fairly well, and when he
opened a shanty at Long Gully he kept
accounts by means of an illustrated
ledger. Squatters were represented by
their registered brands; stockmen by a
horse’s head, a long-necked spur, stock-
whip or broad-brimmed hat, with the
station brand alongside for reference. A
pigtail and a saucepan stood for the
Chinese cook, and a pigtail and a carrot
for the Chinese gardener. A customer who
caused Bricky a lot of thought was the
magistrate. Bricky put him down as a
broad arrow.
‘“Elaps”: That story of the two-headed
snake which frequently quarrelled with
itself and ended by either murder-
ing itself in turn, so to speak, or com-
mitting double suicide (B. 19/7/’33) is
full of interest. Since snakes cannot be
poisoned by their own venom, though
they will succumb to that of another
species, it follows that the thing was
a combination of viper and colubrine, in
which case, each head must have bitten
the rest of it in turn to produce fatal
results. Or the freak must have called in
the assistance of another snake definitely
of a different species, in which event the
tragedy resolves itself into murder.
* * * *
“Reformed Ananias”: How’s this for
coincidence? I read last week in a Syd-
ney daily that a cow which had lost its
calf rushed into a Denman (N.S.W.) shop
where a gramophone was playing a
“crooning” record and wrecked the place
under the impression its calf was vocal-
ising there. The same evening in an
American comic monthly I hit upon a
drawing of a crooner in a roadhouse
somewhere in the woods. He has in his
hand a conical megaphone, and is
staring aghast at a large bull moose
climbing through the window. Moose-
hunters in the U.S.A. make a cone of
birch bark and bleat through it in imita-
tion of a moose cow to lure their prey
within gunshot.
* * * *
“Raeakiaki”: The Maori has little
need these days to lay in food supplies
during the
summer for
winter use, but
custom dies
hard. I was at
Lake Rotoiti
towards the
end of the
year, and on
the day of my
arrival a good
haul of fresh-
water crayfish
had been made
in a dredge
net. Not being
wanted for im-
mediate use,
they were
closely packed
in a row over-
lapping one
another, stones
being piled on
to keep them
in position.
There they
were left until
dead, when
the shells were
stripped off
easily, it being
unnecessary to
break even a
leg or a feeler.
The bodies
were then
neatly trussed
up and hung
in the open. I
didn’t see the
rest of the
process or
taste the fin-
ished product,
but I was told
that when
t h o r o ughly
dried by sun
and wind the
koura would
be packed
carefully and
tightly into
flax baskets, ready for use when required.
They were reckoned a far more delicate
morsel treated in that manner than eaten
fresh —the Maori likes his fish high-—but
the custom must have originated from
necessity.
* * * *
“How”: The Maori can be a very
terse letter-writer. An Auckland firm to
whom some book debts had been
assigned wrote to Henare Matua about
his little lot. This was the prompt reply:
“I do not owe Smith Brothers any money.
All repairs has been unsatisfactory, there-
fore repairs has been paid for.”
* * * *
“Goburrra”: On a recent visit to the
Ovens district (Vic.) I had conclusive
evidence of the fox’s ability to become
a vegetarian. In their dens —hollow logs,
caves and burrows —I found apples,
quinces and even walnuts which Reynard
had carried from adjacent orchards.
There was evidence, too, that blackberry
bushes had been stripped of their fruit by
the same agency. On the summit of Mt.
Bogong one of the chief diets of foxes
is the moth which issues from crevices
and fissures at the approach of night.
Foxes lie in wait at the exits and take
their fill as the moths come forth. The
abos. in bygone days also feasted upon
these moths, and gave the name Bogong
or Bugong, meaning “big moth,” to the
mountain.
* * # *
“Badilla”: Most of the N.Q. sugar
towns have lost a lot of their snap since
they started closing up the pubs in time
to get the bars tidied up for breakfast,
but there was some mild excitement at
Giru, on the Northern railway, the other
day. Two elephants attached to a travel-
ling circus fell out about something and
set about each other in royal fashion.
One was a lady elephant, but she held
her own against odds, for the gentle-
man had long tusks and she none. The
row they made and the noise of the
encounter roused the community, which
rushed out of its abodes in the belief that
another cyclone had arrived. Each fought
itself to a standstill, but the cause of the
quarrel remains a mystery. Both were
sober and there was not another male or
female elephant to complete the eternal
triangle within five hundred miles.
* * * *
“Sailor”: Seamen, as a rule, are men
of initiative and resource. Not so the
survivors of the wreck of the barque
Spirit of the Dawn, which piled up
on the rocks of the main Auck-
land Island (south of M.L.). A num-
ber of the crew managed to get
ashore, but without provisions. E.or
five months they lived in a shallow cave,
subsisting on penguins and shell-fish
eaten raw, for they had nothing with
which to light a fire. One day they
were overjoyed to see a steamer stand-
THEW COP: “Hey, wot’s this mean?”
THE COPPED: “Two years, I expec .'”
ing in toward their refuge. In response
to their signals, a boat was sent ashore,
and from the boat’s crew they learned
that the ship was the Government
steamer Hinemoa on her half-yearly
visit to re-stock the shipwreck provision
depot. The castaways had lived for 20
weeks within a mile of a cache stocked
with good food, matches and other
creature comforts. Their language was
terrible.

“Homfrey Beale”: When I was a small
boy in the Walgett (N.S.W.) district I
suffered from recurrent conjunctivitis,
which medical treatment failed to alle-
viate. One day an old fellow of the
Namoi tribe dropped a few spots of
liquid into my eyes. It smarted con-
siderably, but the blight decreased till in
three weeks my eyes were well. In 40
years I have had no return of the com-
plaint, though I’ve been in some badly
blight-stricken parts. My abo. friend said
the liquid was a distillation of meat-ants
and their eggs, and that it was a com-
mon remedy for eye affections among
his tribe.

“Saxon”: A problem that puzzled the
freight-computor of the air-mail service
between Perth and Adelaide arose when
he found in the passenger-list two tiny
insects bearing the noble name of Bis-
carus lapidarius. They were consigned
to S.A. to help eradicate the lucerne flea.
* * * *
“Plankton”: All fish aren’t cold-
blooded. The tunny ( Thunnus maccoyii )
which attains a length of seven feet and
visits Australian waters in large shoals is
unique among fish by reason of the warm
blood that pulses in its veins. Two
smaller species have been caught on our
coasts, both under three feet long. The
tunnies are members of the mackerel
family, but the rest of the mackerels are
as cold as the seas they inhabit.
* * * *
“Pit-Sawyer”: Recent discussions on
tall trees in The Bulletin, especially by
those boosting the American variety, in-
dicate that the parties to the dispute
might do worse than to refer to old
Baron von Mueller’s claim that the Vic-
torian giant gum ( Eucalyptus amygda-
lina) is the daddy of them all. In a
monograph on the subject, Von M.
quotes one tree 471 ft. high on the Baw
Baw mountains and another 415 ft. long
which was felled in the Cape Otway
ranges. He also states that karri of the
Leeuwin bush ranges to over 400 ft. in
height.

Observe him, as he squats beside his fire,
Th’ untutored savage! No, he’s hardly that.
Some contact of the lower with the higher
Is indicated by that battered hat.
Still, ’spite his hapless race’s slow progression,
Maybe he’s happier than you or 1
In that the evils of the world depression
Pass him so lightly by.
What is he thinking of? It needs no wizard
To postulate it isn’t bodyline,
As with a practised hand he toasts the lizard
On which ’tis in his simple mind to dine.
He runs his close-to-Nature race untroubled;
He has no grievances re doles to nurse;
And if the unemployment tax were doubled
He wouldn’t care a curse.
What do they mean to him —the things that
vex us,
The world so palpably being out of joint,
With trade donged hard upon the solar -plexus
And commerce stopping one upon the point?
What should it bother him if credit’s frozen?
Or Moscow’s five-year plan is in a fix?
Or Hitler has a derry on the Chosen?
Nix, obviously nix.
Here’s one at least with no financial worries,
Budgets to balance or accounts to pay;
No income tax to lash him into “plurries”
Or any other swear-words abos. say.
No fears or doubts are sticking in his gizzard
On currency that’s for inflation booked;
He’ll do his own inflating with the lizard
The moment that it’s cooked.

“Walkabout”: Mention by “Vic” of
early artesian bores in Queensland (B.
28/6/’33) recalls the classic instances. At
Springleigh, on the Barcoo (W.Q.), is the
deepest bore in Australia ; the casing goes
down 7500 feet. The bore on Coongoola
station (S.-W.Q.) had the biggest flow,
over 4,000,000 gallons being emitted in its
first 24 hours. Elderslie station, near
Winton (W.Q.), yielded a supply of boil-
ing water.

“Arrubog”: A peculiar case of resusci-
tation of the apparently-drowned hap-
pened at Croydon, Sydney. A butcher
ordered one of his employees to drown
four pups. They were placed in a kero-
sene-tin of water, covered over and left
for two hours. Taken out apparently
dead, they were buried in stable refuse.
Next morning the pups were ambling
about the yard, quite well and happy.
"I’ve decided to chuck art.”
“Going for a divorce before marriage, so to speak.”
Apparently the warmth in the stacked
manure was sufficient to reinduce circu-
lation and respiration.

Te Babarantiko : Lizards are vora-

perience are the unattractive Tabureitabu-
rimai, equatorial house lizards, drab in
hue and with topaz-bright luminous eyes,
Near Teareareke village, on Butaritari
Island, from a half-grown palm a large
Tabureitaburimai thudded to the road
right in front of Captain R. Cable and
myself. Half its tail broke off and
danced fantastically. Otherwise unhurt,
with food uppermost in thought, tne
lizard stared at its performing tail and
made sudden croC odile-like rush.

“Pick” : In the Orara, a northern
affluent of the Clarence River (N.S.W.),
several sharks have taken U P theif habi *
tat in fresh water. Attracted by refuse
drifting downstream from the meatworks
on t fl e r i ve r’s banks, the .sea scavengers
first foraged in the tidal area below the
junction. When, however, usage ot waste
products at the cannery lessened their
supplies of tucker, the lawyers sought the
deep waters under the factory walls. The
jaws of a 6ft. specimen hooked at this
spot were forwarded to the Sydney
Museum, where they were classified as
the denture of a Port Jackson shark.

“Wainui”: Has any Aboliar ever come
across a genu i ne Maori carved figure
with more than three fingers ? Ive
searched Maoriland’s museums, but,
apart f rom WO rk executed within the last
£ years? Fve never i ocate d a specimen.
The commonly accepted story is that the
originator of the art possessed but three
fin B ers » but this won’t hold water - Three-
fingered carvings are found elsewhere,
the widespread notion that they re pecu-
liar to the Shaky Isles is rubbish. Some
f +h Rniwlrminn imaopc aro nns-
° * oldest Babylonian images a po
sessed of only three fingers, whilst the
same anatomical error has been noticed
in New Guinea, Peru, Antioquia (South
America) and a dozen other localities, so
that, whatever the explanation, it lies a
lot deeper than the M.L. yarn.

“Bush Boy”: While I was walking
along a Vic. bush track a scrub quail
emerged from the bushes that bordered
the path. It stopped a few feet from me,
picked up a dead leaf by the stem and,
swinging it on to its back parallel to its
body, crouched close to the ground, be-
coming invisible. I moved forward
quietly to assure myself it was really
there. It got up in a flash and whirred
o fl, This explains how quail can rise off
Q p en ground and not be visible till in
flight

“Mulyan”: A marble tablet at Swan
Hill and the William Randell lock at
Blanchetown commemorate the achieve-
ment of Skipper Bill Randell, of the
Mary Ann, the first ship built on the
Murray. Randell built her himself, with
timber from the hills behind Mannum;
and he got a local blacksmith to make
the boiler, which was known as “the
concertina,” on account of the way it
expanded under steam. It was wrapped
around with chains to prevent it bursting
The contraption is one of Mannum’s
most cherished relics. Randell, with his
brother Tom as mate, an engineer, two
deckhands and about 12 tons of stores
for sale along the riverside, set off in his
ark to win the reward offered by the
S.A. Government for the first ship to
navigate the river. But the Lady Augusta,
which had been brought round by sea,
overtook him above the junction of the
Murrumbidgee and beat him in the race
to Swan Hill by three hours. The Mary
Ann, however, was the first to carry
cargo on the river, and the first up the
" Cripes, if she had any sense, Dave, she’d close the door until she comes back.”
Murrumbidgee. Until that historic trip
Randell had never been on a boat in his
life. Mannum, the name of his home-
town, means “to do something,” and
Bill certainly lived up to it.

“Frigid”: A peculiarity about the
breeding methods of the crocodile is that
when the young are newly hatched they
are provided with a store of food, which
is yolk, irrthe form of a knob attached to
the stomach, and gradually absorbed.
The egg is about 3|in. long and about
the same as a duck’s in circumference.
Not having the warm breast of a bird,
the female croc, has to leave the eggs in
a hole to be hatched by the sun’s heat.
When born, the babies are about Bin.
long, but they grow very rapidly. For
some reason best known to themselves
they swallow stones, and have done so
from time immemorial, as fossils prove.
* * * *
“Wandi”: Ever bump into a cough
bush? It is a low-growing bushy tree or
shrub with white flowers, found in some
of the Queensland scrubs. When you
find it by blundering into it or striking it
with an axe, you wish you hadn’t. The
under surface of the leaves is coated with
a fine powdery stuff, which is dislodged
in showers at the least disturbance, and
causes violent coughing and sneezing, be-
sides making the eyes run and smart —a
natural equivalent of tear gas. Scrub-
cutters are more wary of it than they are
of the stinging trees. So apparently are
the furred denizens of the bush. You will
see _ the beaten pads of the wallabies
deviating from the bushes, sometimes
sharply, sometimes making a wide detour.

“Amity Point” :> Reference to serving
dugong flesh in a Brisbane restaurant (B.
12/7/’33) is a reminder that when the
century was a lot younger dugong pro-
ducts were on sale in most Brisbane
grocers’ shops, lard and bacon speci-
ally. Both were supposed to be the
last word in nutritive values, but the
fashion passed. The writer several times
sampled the bacon, but the fishiness
always present in the meat of warm-
blooded amphibious creatures was too
prominent to make it palatable. Even
the black duck, most delicious of Aus-
tralian gamebirds, is meat only for a
hungry man if it has been feeding in salt
water, as it often does when dry condi-
tions inland send it coastwards.
* * * *
“Waranbini”: Though very few people
have seen the red snake, that reptile
creeps into the conversation around thou-
sands of campfires. It is the nightmare
snake, the demon of all the dreaded
wrigglers of the bush —according to the
blacks. One was brought into the office
of Glenova station (Q.) by a cat —the
only specimen ever found in the district
—and went to Brisbane Museum. In
1895 H. J. McCooey sent a specimen,
found somewhere in N.S.W., to Sydney’s
Museum. Previously the red snake
(Hoplocephalus superbus) had been met
with only in Tas. and the mountainous
parts of Vic. “Superbus” refers to its
beautiful carmine hue; there is nothing
else superb about the slithery villain ex-
cept its speed. Richmond River blacks
used to tell weird tales about a red snake
that inhabited Wyan Mountain. When
angered, they said, the red streak would
pursue a blackfellow like greased light-
ning. No white man that I know of ever
saw one in the district, but Binghi’s
legend is some evidence that it existed
there.
H*
“M.L.C.”: The naturalist La Billar-
diere, who was with an expedition sent
in search of La Perouse, describes how
the Tasmanian natives “attempted more
than once to charm us by songs, with the
modulation of which l was singularly
struck from the great analogy of the
tunes to those of the Arabs in Asia
Minor. Several times two of them sang
the same tune at once, but always one
a third above the other, forming a con-
cord of the greatest justice.” It was a
far cry in ancient days from Asia Minor
to Australia, but there exists a tradition
that the Babylonians once traded to Cey-
lon and China by way of the E. Indies.
If so, it is not unlikely that they may
have landed on the Australian coast
when adverse winds drove them from
their course.

“Akeake”: Ever tasted seaweed jelly?
At the pah at the Christchurch (M.L.)
Exhibition years ago I tried some green
ulva and purple seaweed, which had been
boiled slowly with sugar. Much prefer-
able is the hard, cold jelly of karengo
(Durvillcea sp .) and the juice of the tutu
o Coriaria ruscifolia), still figuring occa-
sionally on Henare’s menu. Two other
seaweeds ( Gigartina sp. and Gracilaria
sp.) are also used, but they don’t make as
tasty a dish. My first experience of
karengo jelly wasn’t a happy one. My
Maori host, a practical joker, mixed the
seaweed with tutu berries instead of the
juice, and produced a powerful purgative.

“Wainui”: Few countries are richer in
buried forests than Maoriland, the latest
one having been struck by a mechanical
ditcher at New Plymouth at a depth of
30ft. It must have been covered thou-
sands of years ago by an eruption of
Mt. Egmont, but the timber is wonder-
fully well preserved, and a strip of totara
bark looks as if it had just been torn
from a tree. When a similar forest was
discovered at Awapuni, near Palmerston
North, someone, with great labor, con-
verted some of the timber into half a
dozen trays. Every one looked as if it
had been polished and as if different col-
ored woods had been worked into it, but
it needed no inlaying or oiling. Stripped
of the outer covering, the wood exhibited
a dozen different shades of brown, and
gleamed and glistened like polished stone.
One so took Lord Bledisloe’s eye that he
passed over a cheque for ten guineas.
BUSHLAND SPELL.
[FOR THE BULLETIN. ]
These forests that have never known the plough,
Trees that were old before the white men
came,
Uncouth attractive flowers, strange beasts
ah, how
Can such a land be docile and grow tame/
Our older home a richer compost bears
Of human blood and tears; and human lore
Peoples each foot of earth with hopes and
fears,
And binds the present to the days of yore.
There stream and valley, height and windy
down
Have their accustomed spirit; and you may
Find trace of goblins in the heather brown,
And fairy rings on any dewy day.
Here the quick shadow of our tall spare trees
Falls on no age-old fields of human care;
In our abundant light all mysteries
Of airy fancy vanish into air.
Only at times among the ringbarked trees
Some grey primeval dryad-things may roam,
Moaning on cloudy nights along the breeze
At the rude desecration of their home.
Or when the wintry moon is full, perhaps
Some ghostly aboriginal may creep
To peer and wonder at the dingo traps
And flicker through the flocks of alien sheep.
Legend has hardly touched with magic hand
This old mysterious country. Bellbirds yet
Ring their unstoried peal of fairyland,
And plovers cry their unexplained regret.
Yet when the wide dark falls, and hides in
shade
The woodlands wild, the great gray plains
and bare
Beneath our Southern stars, on hill and glade
A still unhuman presence chills the air;
A presence from an older age than ours,
Before our restless kind disturbed her reign,
Watching among uncouth attractive flowers
Till the primeval silence falls again.

eelin6 Too Old At
Vitality comes this
simple way
THE unforgivable sin to-day is to be too
old.” Yet young women —men, too —find
themselves just “worn-out” when they
should be at the zenith of a happy, healthy
life.
You want to enjoy life. You want to let
others find you fit and vigorous. Yon don t
want to be an “always-ill” wife or an “ever-weak’
husband.
Young men and women, finding capacity for
work or pleasure destroyed by constant down-
dragging pain, weakness, back-breaking body
pains, agony to move or turn, bad nights perhaps,
and serious worries such as bladder trouble; most
surely you should realise that the kidneys lie at the
seat of your trouble.
Rheumatism, too, “the illness with a hundred
symptoms”; starting perhaps with sharp twinges
of pain in the muscles, the trouble, if neglected,
will develop until every movement of the body
seems just sheer agony.
Joints swell and become stiff, muscles ache t
and burn, the back seems almost ready to break—all day there is constant down-
dragging pain and at night the tortured nerves refuse to sink to sleep.
Modern science has conclusively proved that the cause of rheumatism lies in
the blood. Poisons, such as uric acid in excess, harmful bacteria and toxins, are
carried through the system. In the case of uric acid, the tiny razor-edged crystals
are deposited in joints, etc., which flash to the brain their pain-struck symbols of
distress.
Weak kidneys, what misery they cause. If they are not filtering and purifying
the system they are allowing uric acid and other poisons to accumulate. That
is why you have pain night and day. That is why you feel and look "too-old.”
It is no use doping the system with drugs, pick-me-ups or purgatives in the
hope of getting back new vigour, when the trouble lies within the system, through
faulty kidney action. There are thousands of men and women suffering daily
“untold agonies” because of kidney trouble in one form or another who could
end their trouble in a very simple way. The only possible means of doing this
is to cleanse the body of pain-giving poisons, and that is a function the kidneys
must carry out.
k \
Years Roll [Back
It is the testimony of not one but thousands
of one-time sufferers which enables us to state that
if you will commence a course with a simple
straightforward remedy, De Witt’s Kidney and
Bladder Pills, your pain and weakness will be
ended.
It does not matter how long you have suffered
or what disappointments you may have had in the
past—get a bottle of De Witt’s Pills to-day and
start strengthening the kidneys, toning up your
nervous system and building once again the real
foundations of health.
Why forego the pleasures of life? Why
continue in constant nerve-destroying pain? Why
be weak and ailing?
If you persevere with this tried and trusted,
40-year-old remedy, you will find your old, tired,
“worn-out” feeling replaced by new vigour and
vitality. Your day’s work will be a pleasure and
your spare-time pleasures doubled. No more
sallow, spotty complexion, no more sleepless
nights, no more stabs in the back. No more
rheumatic pains, bad back, bladder troubles.
Try just one bottle of De Witt’s Kidney and
Bladder Pills and prove this. If within 24 hours
from the first dose you cannot see (from colour of
urine) that they have started their health action,
return the partly-used bottle to the manufacturers
and your money will be refunded in full.

LIFE—A BUSINESS
It is a paradox, perhaps, that while Home Life is a refuge from
business, it is itself a business.
Money enters so largely into everything that it must be planned
for in every phase of life.
; I*- I s * n business that money is earned, in the Home, chiefly, that it
is spent, and there is no sound reason why the spending should not be
regarded as being just as important as earning. In fact, it is far more
important, for earning is difficult, and must employ wisdom, forethought
and energy, while spending is easy, so easy that there is temptation to
spend unwisely.
Every Home, then, is a business, and needs an economic system, of
which the Savings Bank Pass Book can be the valuable basis.

THE MAN
ON THE LAND'S
PAGE
THE
STUFF TO GIVE 'EM
MEGGITT'S LINSEED MEAL
BACON OPPORTUNITIES.
“El V.”: Denmark, with an area of
17,000 square miles—say, three-fifths the
size of Tasmania —and a population of
about 214 to the square mile, has time
for sidelines in farming after it has
pushed our butter, eggs and other leading
products partially off the British markets.
But its biggest trade with Britain is in
bacon. The value of annual exports to
the U.K. of that product is about
£27,000,000 sterling, or £33,750,000 Aus-
tralian. In other words, its bacon trade
alone was worth more than the total
1931-32 exports of all commodities, in-
cluding wool, from Queensland, W.A.
and Tasmania together, and 22 per cent,
more than the value of Victorian exports.
There is only one State in Australia,
N. S. Wales, whose total exports are
worth more than Denmark’s bacon trade,
and that only by less than £900,000 Aus.
We are told that we cannot get the
overseas bacon market because swine
fever is too prevalent here, because in
this climate we cannot grow the kind of
bacon that the overseas markets require.
But won’t would be a better word, for
Denmark has shown us the way.
It is exactly the same tale as with beef.
The Danes have standardisation. They
have established a national breed—a
cross of the local Landrace on the Large
Yorkshire —and their grading is rigid.
We, on the other hand, have half a
dozen breeds and a good many that are
no breed at all. They realise that pig-
raising is an intensive, feeding-and-fatten-
ing proposition and not beset by any pro-
blems of disease which cannot be over-
come by work and strict regulation. We
have no standards, as standards are
understood in European markets, and
we are paralysed by the very thought of
the initial problems.
Canada has taken up the Danish chal-
lenge already, and has long since estab-
lished compulsory grading. All Canadian
pigs marketed publicly, either in sale-
yards or abattoirs, must be sold accord-
ing to official grades, which number nine.
They range from select bacon, which
covers hogs of from 1701 b. to 2201 b., un-
fed and unwatered, long-sided, full-
hammed, properly-fatted and light in
shoulder, jowl and bone, to the under-
fatted or over-fatted types, rough hogs ;
thence to bred sows and stags. A pre-
mium of 10 per cent, is paid on the
prices realised above second-grade aver-
ages, and the Government graders act as
farm instructors when not otherwise
employed.
The Danes, however, go further than
this, for they add a testing system to
minimise grading losses, one of each
potential breeding litter being fattened,
killed, cured and cut up so that the
tendencies of the rest may be judged. As
a result there are in Danish export lines
none of the blemishes which mar our
bacon—-no unevenness in quality or size,
no short, coarse bone, no seedy cut. The
Danish pig is white right through.
If Australian farmers will only begin
to realise that they need to run their
piggeries on factory lines, manufacturing
pork to a pattern instead of letting it
grow in any old shape, we can not only
make an inroad into the Danish market,
but we can absorb a lot of fattening
grain which is going begging.
WOOL ADVICE NOTES.
“Jumbuck”: When you consign your
wool mention in the advice note where
each different line of ages commences
and finishes. For instance, 40 bales of
wool branded AAA wethers may have
been shorn from sheep of different flocks,
of ages from 2-ths to the full mouths.
Note number of bale where each flock
was started and finished. This knowledge
in a broker’s hands invariably means
better prices, because the broker will, if
necessary, catalogue the various ages in
separate lots.
Advise brokers, also, of the numbers
of mixed bales and the kinds of wool
they hold, so that the various contents
can be sorted into their proper places
in the clip.
If advices of this sort are not given,
a grower cannot expect the brokers to
find out such facts for themselves.
DUSTY BACKS.
“Murrawong”: As a result of the dry
year in N. S. Wales, especially in the
West, the 1933 wool clip will carry
much more dust than for several years.
The bulk of the sand or dust lodges on
the sheep’s neck or back. When shorn,
these portions should be removed and
pressed as a separate line. If they’re left
in the fleece, dust will permeate the entire
bale and reduce its value considerably,
since the difference in yield between
shoulder and back wools may amount to
20 per cent. In addition, dusty backs
are wasty and tender.
When the fleeces have been skirted, do
not roll in the usual way. Throw one
side of the fleece across the table,
doubling it so that the edges meet and
the fleece is folded down the middle.
Then, while one man rolls from the
britch, his mate on the other side of the
table combs the dusty wool towards him
with his fingers. Don’t try to tear it
out or you will lose a lot of clean wool;
by combing, as suggested, only the dusty
wool will come away. If possible, dusty
backs should be scoured locally before
marketing. On an average they yield
only 25 per cent., so the owner pays
freight on 751 b. of sand out of every
1001 b. of backs he sends by rail.
DISEASES OF SHEEP.
H. A. Veron, whose veterinary re-
searches are well known, has just pub-
lished “The Diseases of Sheep,” a logical,
well-indexed, -glossaried and -tabled trea-
tise, 460 pages in length, which deals
with every phase of sheep hygiene.
Mr. Veron takes a wide view of the
meaning of the word “disease.” He inter-
prets it to mean “any condition which may
interfere with, disturb, or inhibit normal,
strong and vigorous development of the
young, efficient economic production and
normal physiologic reproduction in adult
animals.” From this premise, he pro-
ceeds to discuss the relationship between
diet and disease, the influence of pas-
ture on the health of animals, with a
simple lecture on maintenance and wool-
producing constituents of fodders ; thence
he turns to physiology, to diagnosis and
the technique of administering medicines.
In the section on prevention, he
sets out ten commandments which would
save a good many thousands of valuable
animals every season if they were obeyed.
Briefly: (1) Do not overstock. Overstock-
ing makes pasture “sheep-sick.” (2) Pro-
vide drinking tanks and clean water. Do
not allow sheep to drink at stagnant
pools and swamps. (3) Never bring
diseased sheep on to a property. (4)
Watch the flock when disease appears.
If you can’t diagnose, be quick in getting
somebody who can. (5) Quarantine sick
sheep at once. (6) Burn all dead animals
promptly. (7) Don’t own wet or swampy
country. Drainage saves lives. (8) Dirty
yards breed disease, so clean regularly.
(9) Keep all marking instruments, etc.,
clean; ditto the shearing board and
shorn-sheep pens. (10) Don’t store dead
wool and skins in the shearing shed.
The medical and surgical section is
excellent. Each disease is sectioned
tersely so that an unaccustomed reader
can grasp its features and understand its
treatment in a few minutes ; and there
are a useful series of gestation and other
tables and weights and measures, and a
sound, short chapter with ration calcula-
tions on drought-time feeding. Sixty-one
photographic plates give clarity to the
text. Those dealing with sheep physio-
logy and post-mortem work are particu-
larly useful for the novice. This is
a book for which (as Sidney L.
Officer, secretary to the Victorian and
Southern Riverina Graziers’ Association,
says in his foreword) sheepowners have
long felt the need ; and it is so cheap
that if the knowledge in it saves a couple
of good lambs it will show the purchaser
a profit. (Our copy from the author.)
MONEY FROM FAT LAMBS.
“Golightly”: The rain came too late
this season to prevent a setback to the
majority of autumn lambs in N.S.W., but
luckily the check to the merino wool-
grower is not as serious as it would be
for the fat-lamb raiser. Fat lambs
affected should be shorn at once. It helps
them to recover on the fresh feed now
provided, and it will be found that they
can go forward to market a few months
later than usual.
In 1912 at Illabo (N.S.W.), I was stuck
with 700 Romney-cross youngsters
dropped in November. The summer was
bone-dry, but the break came at the end
of March. I shore them immediately,
and in June they were snapped up by a
Coolamon butcher.
In average years it pays to drop the
principal crop of lambs in March-April;
but remember that this practice places
all your eggs in one basket, and it is
possibly wiser to drop a few truckloads
in every month of the year —of course,
provided some clean lucerne paddocks
are available for suckers while the grass-
seed is falling.
Fat suckers can be marketed all the
year round from this district (Merriwa,
N.S.W.), at any rate, if Dorset Horn rams
or similar breeds that will mate at any
time are used. The practice eliminates
dry ewes, and many will lamb twice a
year, if given the chance, helping to build
up phenomenal percentages. Also, it is
consistent with the bulk of lambs being
dropped in March as usual, if a line
of early-shorn ewes off-shear is bought
each season —this is vital to get full
profits from fat suckers. Breeding his
own ewes only hampers the fattener.
Under a buying policy the numbers are
kept even by trucking with each lot of
lambs a percentage of the oldest ewes,
which have been mouthed and cull-
branded after shearing.
THE USEFUL WILLOW.
“Lion”: It is curious that more
graziers have not realised the uses and
value of the weeping-willow. Where
there is permanent water, either in small
lakes, lagoons or springs, these beautiful
trees grow readily. All that is required
to start a plantation is a limb off any
willow, old or young, from the size of
a little finger upwards. All will grow,
but the thicker the limb the quicker and
better the tree.
I have now planted some 300 on the
banks of the creeks flowing through my
property, and I shall continue until all
my available space is occupied, because
they are already giving me good fodder.
They provide shade and cool drinking
waterholes in summer (I have noticed the
stock always drink under the willows in
preference to anywhere else); they
beautify the property, and greatly add to
its saleable value.
The more they are lopped the better
they grow ; in fact, one must lop them
to make them perfect. All stock like
them and thrive on them, and lambing
ewes immediately develop an increased
milk flow when fed on their leaves.
The tips for successful planting are:
(a) Cut the limb 14ft. to 20ft. long if
you can, and trim it to a nice shape, leav-
ing little limbs growing off it after the
first 6ft. or so, but no leaves. ( b ) As
soon as cut down put one end in a water-
hole and leave until able to plant—but
no longer than two months. The slip
will grow little roots in the water, (c)
In dry weather sink the holes about 4ft.
or sft. deep to insure a damp soil,
and 50ft. to 70ft. apart. Pour 4gal. of
water into the hole. ( d ) When planted,
staple the trunk with any old netting
to prevent big stock eating the bark
off and killing the tree. ( e) If saplings
do get bitten and barked, paint timber
with pure white-lead oil paint, and then
cover with netting. (/) From March-July
31 is a suitable time for planting, but
August will be quite O.K. this year.
KILLING WHEAT-ROOT GRUBS.
“5.N.0.”: A wheat-grower’s problem
which seems far from being solved is
how to deal with the wheat-root grub,
which has been found in general N. S.
Wales districts this year on farms which
never before were troubled, and in black
soil in which it was believed that it
would not flourish. Many methods of
eradication have been tried, including
the use of poisons such as cyanide, but
they are too costly.
Some farmers have tried rolling with
rollers and cultipackers to crush the
grubs, which are usually about 2in. under-
ground, but this is of little use, especially
in deep-cultivated land.
A good stubble burn seems helpful.
The more straw there is to burn the
better, as the heat will destroy a lot of
the grubs. Just before fallow some
farmers run large mobs of stock over
the field to crush the pests. Grubs do
most damage in July and August. So
it seems that turkeys or fowls following
the cultivator immediately before sowing
might mop up a lot of trouble. At that
time the grubs are fairly small so the
birds can eat a larger number than
when they are fully-grown. Unfor-
tunately, the beetle is not highly-prized
as an article of diet by many birds.
When grazing is required, it is a good
plan to eat off the badly-affected crop
in about late July and sow lucerne some
time afterwards. The insects will not
touch this crop, and the farmer will reap
a paddock of good feed instead of only
a couple of bushels of wheat to the acre.
VIRGIN-SOIL DEFICIENCIES.
“A.C.8.”: Most farmers taking up new
blocks do not have their soils ana-
lysed ; they distrust “these new-fangled
methods.” However, most soils are poor
in some constituent, and many settlers
lose through not finding the weak spot
at once.
The forest soils of N. S. Wales are
mostly short of nitrogen, potash, lime
and phosphoric acid. This is why a light
burn over them is often beneficial. Red-
dish soils contain a large proportion of
iron oxide and are generally well
drained. For these soils a mixture of
3cwt. of super, with 2cwt. sulph. of
ammon. per acre will help most. Ground
should be well limed, but lime should not
be used in conjunction with nitrate of
soda or kainit.
The wheat soils of N. S. Wales mostly
are stiff blackish brown and contain much
alumina and a fair amount of potash.
They are mostly lacking in phosphoric
acid and lime. Shell lime does good to
this class of land. Peas sown in soils
deficient in nitrogen and turned in are

15 PER CENT. SAVING
IN PETROL
Test by Car Owner
To prove that new spark plugs actually
do increase peti-ol mileage, a comparative
test was made by a car owner-driver.
Here’s the report:—
“A very interesting test was held in the
presence of witnesses. On Leggetts Spark
Plugs the petrol consumption of my
LEGGETTS*!
Chrysler “52” was 3
miles on 16 oz., equal
to 30 m.p.g. After re-
moving your plugs a
test with the original
plugs yielded 2.6
miles on 16 oz. These
plugs were of a not-
able standard make,
and apparently in
good condition. On
Leggetts Plugs, petrol
consumption was im-
proved by 4 miles per
gallon, a saving of 15
per cent, in petrol.
Both tests held under
identical conditions
and accurate re-
cords.” Signed

most beneficial. Calculated in pounds
per acre of crop, peas supply 1091 b. of
nitrogen, 621 b. of potash, 681 b. of lime
and 121 b: of phosphoric acid. A mass of
falling leaves usually provides most of
the necessary constituents for the soil
during the first two or three seasons after
virgin scrub soil comes into use.
TASTY FOODS AND PRODUCTION.
“Bahb Dwyer”: Even the sight or smell
of well-liked feeds stimulates the flow of
saliva and gastric juices. Palatable
feeds are digested best, though there are
other factors. Animals used to certain
feeds will at first turn up their noses
at more nutritious and equally tasty
fodders, which, after a while, they will
consume with relish. Production, how-
ever, will suffer during the change-over.
The wise feeder makes dietary changes
carefully, securing gradually increasing
production without check. It is often as
harmful to suddenly introduce a good
palatable feed to which the animals are
unaccustomed than it is to change over
to one which is actually unpalatable.
Many excellent feeds are unpalatable,
whilst some which are keenly relished
cannot give good production results
because of their unbalanced nature.
Others, again, which stock like, are a
menace to their health.
Feeds such as molasses and maize-
' meal, highly palatable but very un-
balanced, should be used judiciously in
conjunction with other richer though less
relished ingredients. They have the same
place among fodders as sweets in the
home menu.

QUESTIONS ANSWERED.
(Transferred from Service Department.)
The soil here contains sulphates and
chlorides of lime and magnesia. What
effect has this on crops and grass ? What
is the difference in this respect and the
nutriment value to stock between sul-
phate of lime and carbonate of lime? —
6624.
Small amounts of sulphates and chlo-
rides of lime and magnesia in the soil
are absolutely essential for the growth
of crops and grass. If these substances
are present in excessive quantities, the
growth of the crops is retarded or en-
tirely prevented. These ingredients have
no nutriment value, but supply the min-
eral requirements of the animal. Car-
bonate of lime is the lime compound
usually fed to stock. There is no infor-
mation available on effects of feeding
sulphate of lime to stock.
(1) Any artificial food that can be re-
commended for sheep-dogs ? (2) What
food do the well-known trial dog-
breeders use for their animals? —6837.
(1) No. (2) Usually mutton and sheeps’
hearts (roasted). Meat, boiled, for dogs
is meat spoiled. Best food for work-
ing sheep-dogs is whole wheatmeal mixed
with fresh meat scraps (no offal, such as
“lights”) cut up and mixed with warm
water to a stiff mash and then baked
hard. Pollard or bran mash is useless,
not being digested. Roast breasts of mut-
ton are good. Roast bullocks’ hearts are
ideal. Raw fresh beef bones are the
best tonic, containing soluble iron and
sulphur. If whole meal is not available,
buy a small mill (275. 6d.) and grind your
own wheat. All meat must be fresh. Bad
meat causes worms and gastric troubles.
(1) Number of acres devoted to dairy-
ing and to grazing in the following
N.S.W. divisions: (a) Coastal, (b) Table-
land, (c) Western Slopes, (d) Central
Plains and Riverina, and (e) Western
Division? (2) Number of acres in the
whole of N.S.W. devoted to wheat and
number of acres devoted to sugar? —6Bo4.
(1) ( a ) Dairying, 4,783,201 acres; graz-
ing, 7,407,892 acres. ( b) Dairying, 354,150

acres; grazing, 32,620,800 acres. (<?)
Dairying, 7634 acres; grazing, 77,462,510
acres. (2) For 1931-32 the area sown
with wheat was 3,682,945 acres for grain;
292,234 acres for hay and 20,008 acres
fed-off or used for green food. For the
same year 8272 acres of sugar-cane were
cut for cane and 800 acres for green
food; 67 acres were used for plants; and
there was an area of 7647 acres of stand-
over and newly-planted cane.

What sort of soil is most suitable? (2)
Method of propagation? (3) Climatic
conditions required? (4) Would Tas-
mania be suitable? (5) How much sugar
is produced per tree? (6) Where, in
Canada, can / obtain further informa-
tion? —6687.
(1) Deep, rich and moist. (2) From
seed. (3) Practically any climate in the
temperate zone will do. (4) It should
be. (5) With 30 trees to the acre the
average yield in Canada is about 1001 b.
per acre. The trees continue to flourish
even after 40 years of tapping. (6) Try

HINTS FOR THE FARM.
“Dimon”: A home-made spring mat-
tress? Use four pieces of light wood for
the frame, bolted together at the ends,
and No. 8 fencing wire. Bore small holes
all round the frame 3in. apart, run wires
through lengthwise and strain; then in-
terlace the cross wires. The result doesn’t
sag, is springy and lasts for years.
“Bunny”: An ordinary boot-hammer
makes an excellent rabbiter’s hoe. If
the blade at the back is sharpened it is
very effective in digging out the “set”
for the trap, and the hammer portion is
quite heavy enough for driving the peg
in. Bore a hole through the handle, make
a loop of stout string, and carry on the
wrist.
“Carben”: Pig-droppings, though rich
manure, are apt if used entire to flavor
vegetables and even to affect corn and
tobacco. The droppings should be rotted
into mixed, dry earth or sawdust, and
the compost thus formed should be
ploughed in from the surface. Three or
four cartloads per acre thus used pro-
duces the best results.
“Tim Tywire”: If rain catches you
with no covering for your bales, they
will “turn” inches of rain set on end,
bottom up. If you can set them on
sticks or piping so much the better, for
you’ll soon have burst bales if the white
ants start on them.
“Sheepo”: Dry heavily stained pieces
and daggy locks well in the sun, and clip
off and burn the dried dags. Don’t press
the dagless stains and locks too heavily,
because heavy pressing will make buyers
think they contain dags.
“Cow Cocky”: The various treatments
for scours in calves can be rendered un-
necessary by reserving a patch of that
curse known as Paddy’s lucerne. The
calves will nibble the leaves, which have
a medicinal value, and either cure the
complaint or keep them free of it.
“Pick”: A worn-out tank with a side
opening cut out flush with the bottom
makes a safe fireplace for wash-boiling
or cooking out of doors. Stood on
levelled stone or bricks, it can be screwed
away from any wind and the danger
from licking flames thereby greatly
lessened.
“Kariah”: Stamp-edging will keep a
badly-cracked lantern-globe or lamp glass
together for months.
“sth Battalion”: “Elgar” (B. 12/7/*33)
is wrong about the price of super. Dairy-
farmers can buy it for £4 2s. 6d. cash
around Murchison.
“Gardener”: The present pruning-time
is opportune to attend to trees that do
not bear well or fail to set their fruit.
For the former, I dig a circle out round
the tree about a six-foot radius and 18
inches deep, and mattock or axe all the
roots I can find, except the tap. Later, tip
in a few barrowloads of garden rubbish
and re-earth. For the non-setter, belt the
trunk and major limbs with the back of
the axe and bruise the bark till ii bleeds.
If only a young tree or slender trunk,
score a deep cut from the ground right
into the limb.
“Alia”: L. Scofield, of Ellangowan
(N.S.W.) owns a Tamworth-Berkshire
cross brood sow which recently produced
a litter of 23 pigs, only one of which was
born dead. The mother later crushed one
to death, but the survivors are strong and
healthy. Fourteen were left with the sow,
the remainder being raised by hand.
“Silo”: On the recommendation of the
Bureau of Industry, the Queensland Gov-
ernment proposes to establish a fodder
conservation authority with power to
buy, hold and sell pastoral fodders. If
it comes into being the body will be inde-
pendent, managed by the subscribing in-
terests. The Government would supply
£30,000 through the Agricultural Bank,
pastoral organisations throwing in
£30,000. These are to consider the pro-
posal, and on them depends the launch-
ing of the scheme, which is intended to
provide a reserve for times of drought.

SPEAKING OF PEWTER.
“There are many collectors of English, Scot-
tish and Irish pewter.”— Brisbane “Telegraph.”
But what a fractional minority they
are compared to the number of English,
Irish and Scottish collectors of what a
pewter contains! In point of fact,
pewter-collecting was even
more popular years ago
than it is to-day, when so
many have adopted the
ancient Scottish custom of
chaining the pewter to the
bar-counter.
How many know that the
Chinese were the first to see
the possibilities of pewter?
Under the Kum Sing
dynasty many a carrot-
grower was swinging a
nimble pewter what time
our hairy forefathers were
having a boulder each way
at the Diprotodons.
Many antiquaries say
that pewter.is a corruption
of Pu Tah, a great War
Lord and founder of the
enormous Hop clan.
As every keen student of
market-garden carts is
aware, China is a land
overflowing with Hops, such as Hop War,
Hop Kow, Hop On and Hop Off, etc.
Even the Great Wall of China owes its
existence to pewter. It was built to keep
out the collectors.

Preparations for the spring divorces

panied by the cash) for something with

Baer is considered by American experts to be
likely to take the heavyweight champion belt
from Camera. He stands 6ft. lin., weighs
14st., and was born at Omaha, Neb., on Feb-
ruary 11, 1909.
(1) Is “motor-car radio” a commercial suc-
cess ? (2) Name of a reliable set obtainable in
Australia and where obtainable ? (3) Will
these receivers operate with a reasonable degree
of success under varying road and weather con-
ditions and at high road speeds ? —6993.
(1) Yes. In America many manufacturers
equip their cars with built-in aerials and pro-
vide cut-outs in the car floors for battery cases,
so as to make the installation a quick and inex-
pensive procedure. (2) The “Roamer” five-valve
automobile receiver, obtainable from Harring-
tons, 266 Collins-street, Melbourne. This set
employs valves which obtain their heater cur-
rents from the car accumulator and their B
supply from dry batteries. The cost, including
installation, is £32 10s. (3) Yes, provided they
are within range of a broadcast station.
What is the process of (1) photogravure, and
(2) lithography ? (3) What constitutes the special
value, if any, of lithography ? —7045.
(1) An intaglio process of reproduction, in
which the design is incised into the plate by
acid. The incisions are filled with ink, which is
drawn out on to the paper by mechanical pres-
sure. (2) A process in which the artist makes
his own plate or block. The design is drawn
in reverse on stone, or a plate of zinc or alu-
minium, with a greasy crayon, and highlights
are scratched into the crayon with a knife. The
block is lightly ptched and prepared for the
press by damping. An inked‘roller is passed
over the block and the crayon takes up the ink
while the damp stone repels it. The inked stone
is then impressed on to paper. (3) It is the only
modern process, bar artists’ etching, in which
the artist himself prepares the stone or plate
to be printed.
(1) What is the correct name of the bird,
plentiful around Canberra, locally known as
a woodpecker ? It has a discordant cry and
pecks the trunks and boughs of trees. (2) Cor-
rect name of another bird, commonly called a
jackdaw, rather larger than a magpie, with
greeny-grey feathers, and clumsy on its feet and
in flight ? —6875.
(1) Probably the white-browed babbler. (2)
Possibly the grey bell magpie. In both cases
the description is not sufficiently detailed for
definite identification.
How can the age of trees be computed ?
6966.
No reliable method is known applicable lo
growing trees. The rings on the cross section
of flie stem at the base of the tree are annual in
the case of many species, but there are many
Australian trees to which even this method can-
not be applied.
What steps should be taken to have the name
of our town, Mosman, registered so that it
will be included in all atlases ? The town is
centre of a sugar district 40 miles north of
Cairns (Q.) with a population of approximately
3000 people, but is not shown in any atlas. —
7081.
Although Mosman is a private township, the
name is shown on a number of maps published
by the Queensland Lands Department. Pos-
sibly representations made to such map pub-
lishers as Phillips, Bartholomew and Bacon
in London and H. E. C. Robinson and Ken-
neth Craigie in Sydney would get recognition
for your town in the future publications of
these geographers.
I understand the N.S.W. Government is going
to spend £25,000 on boots and clothes for the
unemployed. When and how will the distribu-
tion be made ? —6900.
The distribution will be made at an early
date and will be effected through food-relief
depots in the metropolitan district and through
the police in country districts.
(1) What is the nature of the fairies delineated
by Shakspeare in “A Midsummer Night’s
Dream” ? (2) What is the essence of Joseph
Conrad’s style of writing ? (3) Why is
Coleridge’s “Ancient Mariner” considered
great ? (4) What is Barry trying to express in
“Peter Pan”?— 7oll.
(1) See “Fairy Mythology of ‘A Midsummer
Night’s Dream,’ ” by Halliwell, and “English
Fairy Poetry,” by Floris Delattre. (2) A fusion
of psychological intricacy with a sumptuous
vivid style. (3) Because of the deep intensity
of its feeling and expression, the skill with
which the story is made to emerge clearly as
well as dramatically, and the inspired high level
of the technique. (4) It is regarded by most as
an expression of the value of retaining a youth-
fulness of spirit throughout life.
How to treat frangipanni and hibiscus shrubs
which are badly frost-bitten ? —7225.
Remove the affected parts and leaves and
cover the shrubs each night. Keep the soil
stirred at the base of the shrubs and mix with
it a little blood and bone fertiliser. There will
be fresh growth when warmer weather arrives.
Is the fire caused by contact of flint and
steel an electric spark ? —-7210.
It is not regarded as an electrical pheno-
menon, but it would be a brave physicist who
would dare to declare that any dynamic effect
had no electrical significance.
(1) Number of convictions in Australia for
murder, attempted murder and manslaughter
during the last five years ? (2) Executions in
Australia in same period ? —7137.
(1) Figures are available only to 1930 and
are: Murder and attempted murder, 1926, 24;
1927, 30; 1928, 25; 1929, 33, and 1930, 21.
Manslaughter, 1926, 13; 1927, 15; 1928, 17;
1929, 15, and 1930, 8. (2) From 1926 to 1930
there were no executions in N.S.W. (there was
one in 1932), Q’land (where capital punishment
has been abolished), Vic. and Tas.; there were
3 in S.A. and 6 in W.A.
Is it true of the painter J. M. W. Turner that
he went to Christie’s and bid for and bought
his own works ? —7193.
Yes; at the sale of Lord de Tabley’s collec-
tion in 1827. He bought back three.
How to test for a leaky slide-valve in a single-
cylinder steam engine ?■ —7178.
Block the fly-wheel when the slide valve is
in the middle of its stroke as seen by the posi-
tion of the eccentric, which is in mid-position
a little before the piston reaches the end of
its stroke. Open the indicator taps or the
relief cocks, or examine the exhaust pipe. A
steady escape of steam indicates a leaky valve.
(1) What is tea-tree oil used for ? (2) What
is its value ? (3) How is it distilled ? (4) Where
can it be sold ? —7040.
(1) The oil is marketed by Australian Essen-
tial Oils, Ltd., under the proprietary names of
Ti-Trol (oil) and Melasol (water-soluble form).
Details of its use for dental and surgical prac-
tice can be obtained from that firm. (2) About
30s. per gall, at stills. (3) By a steam process,
details of which can be obtained from the
Curator, Technological Museum, Sydney. (4)
Names and addresses of buyers can be obtained
from the Curator.
(1) I have a D.C. milliammeter having a full
scale reading of 10 ma o resistance, 13 ohms).
Could I use this instrument as a voltmeter ?
(2) If so, what alterations would be necessary
for a full-scale reading of 100 volts ? —7159.
(1) Yes. (2) Connect a resistance of 10,000
ohms in series with the voltmeter. Each milli-
ampere division on the scale will then represent
10 volts. The accuracy of the meter will
depend upon the accuracy of the resistance,
whose value should lie between 9980 and
10,000 ohms, the correct value being 9987
ohms. If only approximate readings are re-
quired the resistance may have a greater toler-
ance.
(1) How to find the- electrical resistance of
copper conductors, knowing their area and
length ? (2) What is the area of conductors
1/.036, 1 /.044,, 1/.064? (3) Does the resistance
of a copper wire increase as its temperature
rises ? —7150.
(1) Multiply the area in sq. in., by 42,087
and divide the product into the length in
yards. For example, 1000yds. of copper wire
having an area of .001018 sq. in. (1/036
gauge) will have a resistance of .001018 x
42,087, equals 42.8, which, divided into 1000
gives 23 ohms. (2) .001018; .001521; 003217
square inches. (3) Yes, slightly.
(1) Prospects of employment as a radio
engineer-operator ? (2) Particulars of salary ?
(3) Avenues of employment open to a radio
engineer-operator? (4) Would an electrical
engineering certificate be of any use ?— 7lOO.
(1) Not bright at present. (2) Depends
on what branch of wireless you take up.
Marine wireless operators receive from £lO
12s. 6d. to £27 2s. 6d. per month including
board; shore operators, from £240 to £450
per annum. (3) In any of the branches of the
radio profession, such as broadcasting, operat-
ing, etc. A certificate of proficiency issued by
the P.M.G. Dept, is necessary in most cases.
(4) Yes.
(1) What was the date of the taking over of
German New Guinea by Australia ? (2) How
long was it under military administration ?
7200.
(1) Sept. 17, 1914. (2) From date of seizure
until the establishment of civil government
in May, 1921.
(1) Full size of double and single tennis
courts ? (2) Are twelve feet on the back lines
and six. feet on side lines sufficient outside
spaces for grass courts ? (3) Should the court
slope from net, either to base lines or side lines
or both, and, if so, how much ? (4) Is ten feet
sufficient height for wire netting on grass court
with above outside areas ? (5) Can couch
grass be satisfactorily grown from seed and is
it desirable to mix other seeds to give a surface
while couch is establishing itself ? —6785.
(1) Tennis court size is 36 x 78 feet; service
court, 21ft. on each side of the net. Difference
between single and double court is 9ft., 4ft. 6in.
on each side. (2) Not sufficient. Champion-
ship regulations provide for 21ft. at each end
and 12ft. at each side, but less is often made to
do. (3) Drainage is generally arranged by a dif-
ference of 4in. from one end of the area (court
and space at end) to the other. (4) 16ft. is
more generally used. (5) The best plan is to
plant couch grass, roots and all, just under the
surface when completed. It comes more quickly
than seed, and ensures a clean court. A mix-
ture is not desirable.
(1) In what year was the wireless telephone
service opened between Australia and Eng-
land ? (2) To what other countries does it
extend ? —7207.
(1) 1930 (April 30). (2) U.S.A., South
America, Java, M.L. and some trans-Atlantic
vessels at sea. Any telegraph office will give
you details.
(1) Why was Bradlaugh refused entry to the
House of Commons ? (2) What was his parent-
age P—7189.
(1) When elected for Northampton in 1880
he refused to take the oath, claiming the right
to make an affirmation under the Parliamen-
tary Oaths Act. He was rejected by the
House, his subsequent offer to take the oath
“as a matter of form” being regarded as in-
sulting. After being re-elected four times he
was permitted to enter, on his own terms, in
1886. (2) He was the son of a solicitor’s clerk.
(1) Are there opportunities for employment
in the Northern Territory, preferably motor-
driving or repairing, on Government construc-
tion work or other undertakings ? (2) Where
can information be obtained ? (3) Any prefer-
ence to ex-Diggers ? —6990.
(1) No Government jobs available; can’t
say as to private employers, but chances in
that direction seem slim. (2) So far as Gov-
ernment work is concerned, from the Secre-
tary, Department of the Interior, Canberra, or
the Administrator, Darwin. (3) The Public
Service Ordinance of the Territory provides
that preference shall, subject to competency, be
given to returned soldiers.
(1) Who was the first Governor-General of
Australia ? (2) In what year was he appointed ?
—7224.
(1) Sir Charles Fitzroy. (2) July 1, 1851.
There is a distinction between Australia and
the Commonwealth of Australia. Lord Hope-
toun was first Governor-General of the Com-
monwealth (1901).
My rhododendrons are making poor head-
way. (1) What’s wrong ? (2) Can the shrubs
be propagated, and how ? (3) Manures which
can be given ? (4) When to put in shrubs
bought in pots from a nursery ? —7252.
(1) Probably there is lime in the soil, which
is death to the shrubs. Lift them, dig out the
soil and replace with fresh earth: taken from
pasture-land. (2) Rhododendrons can be pro-
pagated from layering (for preference), cuttings
(placed in sandy loam) and grafting. (3) Mulch-
ings of rotted stable manure in October. (4)
Up to the end of October new stocks can be
set out; but make certain not to disturb the
roots when doing so. With rhododendrons cool
climate and cool situations are most suitable.
They need plenty of water.
(1) Every morning my couch-grass lawns have
masses of raised earth mounds. Cause and
cure ? (2) When should top-dressing be done
in Sydney ? —7238.
(1) Earth-worms are eating the roots of the
grass, and throwing up the soil. Brush the
mounds away with a fine broom and spray the
sections with lime and water or with insecticides
obtainable from seedsmen. (2) In August.
Make sure that the surface is thoroughly levelled
before top-dressing, then work the soil into the
grass with a board or the back of a rake.
When the new growth shows up in September
the roller can be used. A further light top-
dressing can be given in October, mixing into
the soil sulphate of ammonia or blood manure
(2oz. to each kerosene-tin of earth).
(1) What are the races of mankind and their
numbers ? (2) Number of people that the earth
is capable of maintaining ? —7107.
(1) The main racial divisions and their esti-
mated numbers are: Mongolian, 680,000,000;
Caucasian, 725,000,000; negro, 210,000,000;
Semitic, 100,000,000; Malayan, 104,500,000;
Red Indian, etc., 30,000,000. (2) It has
been estimated that the earth can maintain a
population of 6,000,000,000, a total which
should be reached about a.d. 2100 if the pre-
sent rate of increase continues unchecked.
Who was George Vertue, the engraver, and
what are the “Vertue manuscripts” ? —7090.
He was born in London in 1684 and was
apprenticed to a French engraver. Later he
became a pupil of the Dutchman Van der
Gucht. His engravings and book illustrations
are well known to collectors and his contem-
porary portraits have considerable value. He
was the compiler of a history of art in Eng-
land, and some 34 of his manuscript notebooks
are extant. From these Horace Walpole evolved
the four volumes of his “Anecdotes of Paint-
ing in England.” The Walpole Society is print-
ing the manuscripts at the rate of one volume
every two years.
What is Amager work and who makes it ?
7179.
An ancient traditional embroidery craft made
by the inhabitants of the island of Amager
near Copenhagen. The designs are almost
invariably floral, in clusters, wreaths and
clumps, in which the floral motif is always de-
picted full-faced. In old specimens the dyes
were concocted from the flower and herb
gardens. The designs are essentially Dutch
in character and the natives of Amager are of
Dutch extraction.

Vision in Banking
The urge to build is visible
in all the works of Austra-
lian men with breadth of
vision. It is visible in Bank-
ing. The great banks, like
the pastoralists and manufac-
tures, are pioneers. They
went out where they were
wanted and established those
services and facilities which
are needed to-day and will
be needed to-morrow.
The growth of the National
Bank’s four hundred and
thirty offices and the exten-
sion of its departments until
it can serve its clients in a
thousand intimate ways, has
been planned on the fore-
knowledge of the work that
can be done by a staff of
financial specialists inspired
by a code of public service.
Its arrangements for transacting Foreign Business have been widely
extended, and, in addition to the two offices in London, the Bank
has Agents in every city of business importance in the World.

SPORTING
NOTIONS
Under the Whip
The Australian Hurdle of 3| miles and
50 yards is to be run at Caulfield next
Saturday. Last year the race was won
by P. Grant Hay, brewer of Richmond
beer, with Lord Darnley; the favorite
this time, Poidale, is also owned by Hay.
Through Poitrel, his sire, Poidale in-
herits stamina. It was no disgrace for
him to be beaten at the week-end by
Zetheus in the Jumpers’ Flat at Moonee
Valley, as the Claro gelding performed
well as a galloper before being put to
service over the battens. Zetheus belongs
to P. S. Barrett, an aerated-water manu-
facturer.
Eleven horses survived first accept-
ances for the Australian Hurdle, but Far-
lure, being somewhat amiss, has been
scratched and F. W. Hoysted intends to
Withdraw Lynden. Twelve months ago
Sarocto was second in the marathon
hurdle. He is again engaged, but may
have a preferable chance in the Aus-
tralian Steeplechase. Phocis, who rested
while the Grand Nationals were being
disposed of, has acquitted himself bril-
liantly in recent hurdle trials, and, even
with list. 101 b., must take a lot of beat-
ing. He concedes 81b. to Belar. Latter
had an outing in the Glen Orla Handi-
cap at “The Valley,” but was at 25 to 1,
and ran as the odds suggested. Pitoota’s
third to Farlure and Disney on July 22

is a recommendation. Zygon won the
Doutta Galla Hurdle in fast time, but
was a poor third to Poidale and Dark
Dawn at Caulfield subsequently. Poidale
ought to hold him safe, and may win
on Saturday from Phocis and Pitoota.
Prominence of Poitrel progeny as
jumpers in Victoria is most remarkable.
The Grand National Hurdle was annexed
by Belar, with Lynden second. Poidale is
favorite for the Australian Hurdle. At
Moonee Valley the Gellibrand Trial
Hurdle went to Poitreux, a gelding by
Poitrel from Treux. At one period the
dam of Poitreux was owned by A. V.
Hiskens, secretary of the Moonee Valley
R.C., who bred from her. Treux is by
Bobadil, and goes back to the famous
brood mare Sappho. Like the Grand
National Hurdle victor, Poitreux hails
from the Western District, but originally
he was raced by T. J. Hayes in Mel-
bourne. Short odds had to be accepted
about Poitreux on Saturday ; any price
was good, as he simply romped home.
There used to be a time when a race-
horse was automatically disqualified if
the jockey exceeded the limit of over-
weight, but stewards now are vested with
discretionary powers. Brown, who won
the Derrimut Handicap at Moonee Val-
ley on Watchful, proved to be 2|lb. over-
weight, due to having donned a sweater
in which he did not go to scale. A fine
of £5 was imposed on the lad for care-
lessness, but Watchful got the race, which
the little son of Drake well deserved.
Just when the favorite, Press Gang,
seemed to have victory assured, Watch-
ful put in a splendid effort, and got up
in time to score by a neck. Tampa Bay,
the dam of Watchful, was imported from
England by Dr. A. E. Syme, and is from
a mare by Bayardo. Earlier in the sea-
son Watchful competed in events for
ponies. Valmist will win very soon. He
disputed control with Kaoota as far as
the home turn, but the track was very
heavy and he tired.
Divisions of the Sunset Welter were
captured by Duality (a daughter of Two,
by The Welkin) and All Joy, respectively.
The second-division finish was particu-
larly thrilling, half-heads separating All
Joy, Last Court and Lou Robertson’s
Top Gallant gelding Maharatta.
Protea is getting back to the form
which enabled her to win the Oaks. This
daughter of Equator timp.) was unlucky
to lose at Ascot (Vic.) on July 26. Three
days later she had a great tussle with
Prince Leo in the Glen Orla Handicap
at Moonee Valley, and prevailed by half
a neck, with Gladadder a close third.
High Brae, favorite, did not have a good
passage, and finished rather far back.
In this race the horses were formed into
three sections at the post by the erection
of special barriers, consisting of a single
rail, erected on two posts sunken- into
the turf for 2ft. 6in. Object, of course,
was to prevent the runners from shifting
about, and the device served its purpose.
Immediately the start took place the bar-
riers were removed and the holes safely
refilled before the field came round again.
This system is to be adopted at Caulfield
and probably Flemington as well.
* * * H=
Newcastle people dropped heaps of
money at Victoria Park on Sir Duninald,
Rotary and Speldon. Speldon got a place,
but Sir Duninald and Rotary never
looked like winning. Sir Duninald was
handicapped by drawing No. 17 at the
barrier, and he was wide out for most
of the way in the Zetland Stakes. He
worked into a good position at the turn,
and his owner. H. T. Lucerne, and trainer
Fahey smiled when the chestnut made a
dash at the Leger. It was short-lived,
and Sir Duninald was well beaten when
the judge was reached. The winner, Sky
Brightener (8 to 1), is in the Epsom with
6st. 101 b. He was lucky to defeat the
Cessnock-owned Milantheon, who has
come into the boom for the spring handi-
cap as a result of his close second. His
tote div. for 10s. was £lO Is.
A few seasons ago the Victorian trainer
M. Crossey paid a successful visit to
Sydney with Beauhania and Alligator.
He made no mistake with the Heroic
filly Porcia in the first division of the
Nursery at Victoria Park. She had
shown pace in her races on the southern
tracks, and the bookmakers knew all
about her ; they opened her favorite at
5 to 4. The result was not in doubt, as
she jumped into the lead at barrier rise,
and won with her head on her chest.
The second division went to the Tippler
filly Rona Valley, who carries the colors
of Mrs. J. S. Bovill. Like Porcia she is
on the small side, but is so brilliant that
she should win more races for her
owner.
The progeny of imported Catmint are
noted for their ability to handle soft
going. Fairway, having his first run this
side the Tasman, was the medium of
a successful plunge in the Highweight
Welter; from sixes he was backed to 7
to 4. He won easily from Winrose and
Cherbourg; the early favorite Double
Dutch only beat a couple home. Flushed
with success Dominion sportsmen went
solidly for Desert Star in the Victoria
Park Handicap. He started favorite in a
keen betting race, but never worked into
a prominent position. Dalmatic (6 to 1),
who is trained at Warwick Farm, and
is owned by the pastoralists T. and A.
Sheil, won nicely from the topweight
Magnetic, who ran his race in patches
and appeared to be troubled by the
going in the early stages. Old Luck’s All,
a stable mate of Rona Valley, was third.
The late Fred Williamson had a good
opinion of Baltimore before the Cyllene
More gelding won a novice race at Rand-
wick. T. Summers, who was his foreman,
took over Baltimore, and the gelding’s
superb condition stood to him at the
finish of the first division of the Encour-
age Stakes. With East Molong and Mol-
vius out of the way, form pointed to
Baltimore, who was favorite at 5 to 2.
He made his run in the straight after
the jumper Yarrawin had set the pace
to the Leger. The second division
brought joy to the bookmakers, as the
Wallace Isinglass gelding Fickle Wallace
(14 to 1) finished too strongly for Earl-
minster and the favorite, Speldon. When
Speldon got to the front in the last fur-
long he looked as if he would win, but
old Donald’s stablemate has not much
dash. He may do better in longer races.

Australia’s sprint champion, Winooka,
made his first appearance in a race in
America at Tanforan in California on
Sunday. The original match was against
Frisky Matron, a performer of average
class, but injury necessitated her being
withdrawn in favor of a Hawaiian-bred
unknown named Hueu. The race proved
an exercise canter for the Australian,
who is said to have started at 10 to 1
on. Winooka ran the five furlongs in
Imin. 2-ssec., or two-fifths of a second
slower than the track record. The prize
is variously stated at 10,000 and 5000
dollars.
R. J. Adams, whose sudden death sur-
prised his wide circle of acquaintances
last week, was one of Sydney’s best-
liked racing pressmen and at the time
of his death was sporting editor of the
“Labor Daily.” For years before his
connection with that paper he had been
a contributor to The Bulletin. N.S.W.
born he was educated at North Sydney
Grammar School and in England. He
was only 51 at the finish.
* * * $
“Shell Out”: The A.J.C., finding that
tote betting continues to fall off, is talk-
ing of putting in a ss. machine to catch
the small money which is nowadays
eagerly accepted by chastened book-
makers, who once scorned anything less
than a quid. The estimated decrease for
the season just ended is £136,000, most
of the drop being in the paddock enclo-
sure where the minimum is 10s. In
Sydney, Rosebery, Ascot and Kensing-
ton have changed from 10s. to ss. with
gratifying success. The leading race
clubs in all the other Australian capitals
feature a ss. tote in their paddock en-
closures. In England, the Betting Control
Board insists on a minimum 2s. fote,
M.Q, (and Rafferty) Rules
The Leichhardt “wrestlers” still have
their public, though their methods don’t
vary much. Bill Beth and Walter Brown-
ing had the latest date, and Browning
did some brawling with Lurich, the leader
of the fortunate band, after each wrestler
had thrown the other out of the ring in
the sixth round. Biting, butting, kick-
ing and punching were witnessed before
Beth upset Browning seven or eight
times with standing over-arm headlocks,
and then body-pressed him for a fall,
in the third. Then Browning’s rabbit-
killers rattled Beth, who fell a victim to
a Boston crab in the fifth. Falls were
still even when hospitalities ceased. An-
other draw.
Footbrawl
Saturday’s League football in Mel-
bourne was mostly one-sided, but South
and Collingwood, battling for their last
chance of reaching the finals, provided
thrills right to the finish. Better teamwork,
more pace and anticipation gave Colling-
wood a fair lead, the Magpies starting
the last quarter with 24 points in hand ;
then South, seeing its hopes fading and
urged by the roars of its barrackers, put
in a burst that, bit by bit, brought the
scores level. The Red-and-Whites made
a last dash and, even as the bell rang,
Brain marked in front. The resultant
goal put 'Wood definitely among the
also-rans: South, 89 points; ’Wood, 83.
Down at Geelong the locals found the
conditions to their liking, their fine pace
and straight kicking putting it all over
Carlton’s Blues and landing them home,
117 points to the other’s 44. Fitzroy,
hanging grimly to fourth place, took
no risks with St. Kilda and trounced the
Saints adequately with 124 points to 44.
Richmond likewise accumulated 124
points against Footscray’s 65. North
Melbourne downed Hawthorn with 74
points to 62, and Melbourne with 106
points defeated Essendon with 91. As
things are, Fitzroy, South Melbourne and
Footscray all have hopes for the four,
and it’s a toss-up which gets there.
* He * *
The Wallabies won the fourteenth
match of their tour against Border Pro-
vince, one of the strongest of South Afri-
can sides, at East London,' by the
satisfactory margin of 24 points to five,
or six tries, three converted, to a con-
verted try. The tourists led 11-0 at half-
time. Outstanding was Malcolm, who
went out in the third match with a dis-
located shoulder, but proved in rare form
after his long spell on the sideline.
Kelaher was again in great buckle on
the wing, scoring twice.
* * - * *
Western Suburbs and Manly kept their
leading positions on the Rugby Union
competition table as the result of Satur-
days matches in Sydney. Western was
supposed lo be in danger from Northern
Suburbs, but the meeting of the pair at
Concord showed Western the winner,
after a rare forward tussle between two
good packs, by 8-3, or two tries, one
converted, to a p.g. Western’s score
would have been heavier if Barnes had
kicked in his usual form. Manly v.
Drummoyne provided another forward
battle with the backs idle half the time.
Manly won 16-12. Randwick trounced
St. George, 22-0, and Uni. frolicked over
Eastern Suburbs at Uni. Oval with a
score of 48-9.
* * * *
In the Rugby League competitions
South Sydney took another setback,
being beaten this time by its old rival
Eastern Suburbs 26-3. East now leads
with 14 points. South, Balmain, New-
town and St. George are bracketed to-
gether in second place with 13 points.
In the other games Newtown easily beat
University 13-5, Balmain defeated St.
George 17-7, and North Sydney won
narrowly from Western Suburbs 11-10.

Racquet and Bawl
France’s long tenure of the Davis Cup,
begun with a win over America in 1927,
has ended at last, the British challengers
winning at the Roland Garros Stadium
in Paris by three matches to two, with
the result hinging on the final singles.
When Perry and Austin beat Cochet and
Merlin in the opening singles, backers
of Britain counted their men home and
dried. Brugnon and Borotra took the
doubles from Hughes and Lee, the latter
replacing Perry, alleged to have col-
lapsed, but in reality resting for his next
singles game. Then a dour battle between
Cochet and Austin saw the Frenchman
win by three sets to two. When Merlin
took his first set from Perry in the second
singles British stocks slumped. However,
Perry won the next three, 8-6, 6-2, 7-5,
and Britain regained the Cup, the first
win since 1912.

Footbrawl
“Hotham”: What’s up with Australian-
rules football? Lately the Rugby Leaguers
of N.S.W. and Queensland have been
professing a desire to amalgamate with
the Australian League. Now the lid goes
on with a letter from Russia asking for
a book of the Australian rules, and ex-
pressing a wish to teach the proletariat
the game under a five-year plan. The Aus.
League would do better to give the Soviet
a miss. If the latter is keen on adopt-
ing a football code, it can turn attention
to the Rugby League, which is looking
for a means of enlarging its limited hori-
zon if there is any money in it.
* * * *
“Cash Amateur”: One aspect of the
proposed amalgamation of the Rugby
League and Australian-rules codes is the
utter ignorance of the first-named code
displayed by newspapers which ought
to know better. One Melbourne jour-
nal of repute points out that the
Rugby League is willing to waive
its rights “as senior body.” An
Adelaide journal gravely comments that
as the Rugby League is purely amateur
there may be trouble over joining up
with the paid A.R. players! Though it
doesn’t know it, apparently, Australian
rules is the senior of all the recognised
codes, antedating both the Rugby Union
and the British Association. The League
is many years junior to all three, having
been evolved in Lancashire as the North-
ern Union in 1889. The game, of course,
is a purely professional organisation, both
in the North of England and in Aus-
tralia.
* * * *
“Squeak”: Manly, one of Sydney’s
leading Rugby Union clubs, has pre-
sented an ultimatum to the N.S.W.R.U.
demanding a return to the Rugby-
League rules governing the kick into
touch. In a wet season, Manly has found
its gates falling off. It blames the return
of the old rules as slowing up the game
(there was not much sign of this at Dur-
ban the other day, by all accounts), and
threatens that if it can’t have its own
way its officials will resign in a body.
To return to the League rules would
mean losing touch with M.L., the Inter-
national Board and all the overseas
unions. Even the certainty of retaining
the Village officials at their posts could
hardly make up for that.
* * * *
“Past Grammar”: P. L. (“Puss”) Hart,
who has been appointed temporarily to
the Queensland Supreme Court Bench,
and is in the running for a permanent
Wig, was a Rugby Union player of parts
in the years that the locust hath eaten.
He was a front-row specialist and a
smart all-round forward. He dropped
out of the game early or he might have
found a regular place in the Queensland
side. As it was, he repped in 1897 in a
third match played against N.S.W. that
season.
* * * #
“Stand Off”: Reference to the possi-
bility of an American Universities Rugby
Union team visiting Australia (B.
19/7/’33) reminds me that a side from the
same sources most surprisingly cleaned
up the Olympic championship at Paris
in 1924, when it beat France 17-3 to
the tune of the most terrific barracking
ever heard at a Rugby match. The men
came to London a raw lot, and were
coached by several leading English play-
ers, one of them being Australian Tommy
Lawton, then at Oxford.
The Nineteenth Hole
“Divot Digger” : The dissatisfaction in
N.S.W. golf with the method of playing
the amateur championship in vogue at
the recent meeting has culminated in a
petition signed by many of the leading
players and addressed to the State Golf
Council. This asks for a return to the
old method of qualifying rounds over 36
holes of stroke play, the 16 leading
players to meet in match play over 36
holes. The Council’s excuse for the
change was that in June the short days
would make it difficult to run a 36-holes
stroke event, but it does not seem to have
occurred to it to change the date to an
earlier or later one. However, the buck
has been passed to the match committee,
which will have the blame or credit for
any action taken.
* * * *
“Mid-iron”: Yet another N.S.W.
golfing prodigy of tender years is a can-
didate for future big golf. This is 15-
year-old R. Davies, who recently won the
championship of the Cammeray club.
The player he beat was J. S. Macqueen,
for six successive years champion of the
club, and a man who knows every blade
of grass on it by its Christian name.
There is an ironical touch in the fact
that when Macqueen first won the title,
the man he beat was J. H. Davies, father
of his latest conqueror.
* * * *
“Baffy”: The proposal to invite a team
of British amateur golfers to Australia
has taken a step forward. The Victorian
Golf Association has asked the Austra-
lian Golf Council to issue an invitation,
the visit to be made during the Mel-
bourne centenary celebrations. Further,
the Vies, have promised to back the bill,
which should be a strong recommenda-
tion to some of. the other States which
have been hanging back in the collar.
* * * *
“Bit o’ Common”: That complaint
about the ball-stealing crows at Binalong
(N.S.W.) makes me tired (B. 26/7/’33).
FOOTBALL UMPIRE'S WIFE : “Just fancy your being able to walk home again
this week! Thank goodness you re becoming more popular!”
If a man hasn’t initiative enough to guard
his property, “good enough for the
crows,” I say. For instance, one of our
members at Guyra has no qualms. He
has a pet magpie, and when he drives off
Maggie travels with the ball. If neces-
sary she tackles the crow and, even
when the latter has been in possession,
has made him drop it. What between
her scrapping powers and her language
there isn’t a crow round Guyra that
doesn’t give her and her human offsider
a wide berth now.
Car and Cycle
“Formula” : From the United States
come reports of successful trials of a
steam-engined aeroplane, weighing 1801 b.
and developing 150h.p.: a two-cylinder,
compound, double-acting V-type. The
flight radius is 400 miles on 10 gallons of
water. A successful aero steam-engine
means a practicable car engine. The
throttle control and reverse has made
landing at almost a stop possible in the
’plane. What it would mean in the case of
a car needs no explaining, while the petrol
problem would vanish entirely, the boiler
being fired with crude oil under pres-
sure. There have been several successful
steam-cars in the past, but we hear little
of them to-day. One of the obstacles
was the difficulty of obtaining pure water
for the boiler. If this can be overcome,
Australia has a great future for the
steam-car.
* * * *
“Methuselah”: The new eight-cylinder
double-opposed Ford car which has been
attracting so much attention had a long-
forgotten forebear on somewhat similar
lines. This was a 1904 model with the
Bh.p. two-cylinder engine horizontally
opposed, and placed under the driving-
seat, the car having a dashboard instead
of a bonnet. It was advertised as a
special feature that, by loosening six
bolts, the entire body could be freed from
the chassis. Those who have driven the
famous “Lizzie” which succeeded this
machine will recall that the later model
mostly loosened its own bolts, and wasn’t
particular about the number, either.
* * * *
“Kick Starter”: British motor-cycle
experts have been complaining of the
Australian practice of holding endurance
trials over 24 hours, saying these are
more speed events than endurance and
reliability trials like those in Britain held
over a much shorter period. The truth
is that the British trials are largely trick-
riding stunts with elaborate difficulties
created for rider and machine. The Aus-
tralian trials on roads left in their natural
state and under all-weather conditions
are severe enough for anything.
*l*
“Hotham”: Victoria is confident it has
found a push-bike champion to step into
Hubert Opperman’s shoes when that
worthy gives the game best. This is the
15-year-old Jack Dowling (no relation
to the Wild Colonial Boy), who has
cleaned up most of the opposition. A
rider for only two years, he recently
won the Victorian junior championship
on the roads, and has followed that up
by taking the Australian junior title over
15 miles in four laps, of which he won
three.
Racquet and Bawl
“Top Spin”: The experts were stag-
gered when selector Rene Lacoste picked
22-year-old Merlin as the fourth man
for the team to defend the Davis Cup
against Britain. France hoped Borotra
would repeat his singles comeback of
last year, but the Basque was determined
to stick to the doubles with his old
cobber, Brugnon. Merlin’s past record
is by no means an impressive one, judged
by first-class standards, but Lacoste evi-
dently thought him the only possibility
in sight.
* * * *
“Rev. Knucklebone”: The America-
Britain match for the Davis Cup ended
unhappily for Vines, for not only did he
faint on the court in his match with
Perry, but a specialist has announced that
in future he will have to play his tennis
in specially-made ankle-supporting boots.
Students of barracking might note that
when the fainting Vines was helped from
the court a Frenchman accused him
of squibbing, a happening that caused
Borotra to talk fight. The expression
used was chique, which in ordinary
French means a quid of tobacco. What-
ever the slang equivalent is, it set Borotra
chewing.
* * * *
“Cut Shot”: The new system of elim-
inatory matches in the European zone
for the Davis Cup was nearly thrown
out by the representatives of the par-
ticipating nations at the meeting held last
week, the proposal only winning through
by seven votes to six. Britain, Australia,
Japan and Czecho-Slovakia are all set for
1934, but the others have to fight for
places. Already Germany has knocked
out Ireland by three matches to nil, while
Denmark has cut out Greece by four
to one.
Miscellaneous
“Davos”: The arid, sun-smitten wastes
of Australia beheld a sight unheard-of
overseas last week, when the Victorian
Ski Club held its annual championships
on the snows of Mt. Buller. At the
same time, the Alpine Club of N.S.W.
foregathered on the slopes of Kosciusko
for its meeting. These winter sports are
becoming increasingly popular in those
Australian States which can furnish the
right conditions. In ice hockey this coun-
try has turned out several champions,
one or two of whom have done well in
first-class European company. Some day,
perhaps, we shall have ski representatives
at an Olympiad.
* * * *
“Bonspiel”: Curling, revived in Mel-
bourne some months ago, is making good
headway, regular matches being now
played at the Glaciarium. The clubs
have been hampered by a shortness of
stones, but a consignment has arrived
from Scotland and all is well. A better-
game for winter can hardly be imagined,
and since the average stone weighs
between 351 b. and 401 b., there is plenty
of exercise in it. Maoriland is the only
other country south of the Line where
the game is in being. Curling derives
its sub-title of “the roaring game,” not
from the bellowing of its excited devotees,
but from the booming of the stones on
the ice rink. The game should be fol-
lowed by a dinner of corned beef and
cabbage with hot whisky and water.
After that, call in the doctor if you are
not a Scotsman.
* * * *
“H.H. & B.”: The Riverina side is
seething with secession—not politically,
but in a cricketing sense. The Albury
and Border C.A has notified the
N.S.W. body, which has never been re-
markable for its regard for the game as
played along the Murray, that it desires
to go over to the Victorian body, as a
section of the Australian Rules footballers
has done. Ma has suggested a con-
ference at Wagga to talk the matter over
on August 19, but the general trend of
opinion among the players on that side
of N.S.W. seems to be strongly in favor
of cutting the painter.


A GALLERY OF GOLFERS.
No. 2.
Low and Long-markers at The Lakes.
The Lakes club has its habitat by the
shores of the Botany lakes on what was
once part of the catchment area for the
city water supply. It is a comparative
pup among the more important metro-
politan clubs ; the idea of it originated
only four years ago, and play has been
in progress some three years.
George Solomon conceived the notion
and became the first president. He en-
listed a group of enthusiasts, among
whom were J. R. Lee, M.L.A. (then Min-
ister for Justice), T. E. Watt, C. U. B.
(“Cubby”) Garnett, F. B. Richards,
Gordon Booth, Gordon Noble, Eric
Rowley and Arthur H. Wright; and when
the Water Board put up the area for
lease by tender, the pioneers grabbed the
chance with both hands.
An unusual proviso was tagged to the
lease ; the club had to lay out and main-
tain at its own expense a public course
in addition to its own property.
A limited liability company was
formed and debentures of £25 were
offered to intending members: every
man had to take up two, and every asso-
ciate one. The necessary capital of
£25,000 was soon available. There are
at present 320 full members, 10 country
and 13 non-playing members, 10 juniors
and 140 associates.
Club course (6126 yards) and public
course (slightly over 5000) were designed
by Eric Apperley and Tom Howard.
Eighteen-holes both, they run side by
side, separated by the chain of lakes.
The public course is known as Eastlake ;
it is open to all-comers under the usual
conditions but, iike Moore Park, has a
private club (the Eastlake G.C.). The
greens are grassed with creeping bent and
the fairways are mostly couch. Both
courses are perfectly drained.
Par for the club course is 72. The
country is open and rolling, and the
course a picturesque one in all respects.
The clubhouse is an exceptionally fine
one, a special feature being the double-
decker locker-room, and it is very com-
pletely equipped for social as well as
golfing requirements. The professional is
Arthur East, whose experience during his
years in America has proved invaluable.
Membership has steadily increased until
to-day the committee is considering clos-
ing the list.
There are two outstanding trophies.
The ’Tween Decks Cup, donated by
Adolph Basser, is played for twice a
year by teams representing the upper and
lower “decks” of the locker-room. This
is always followed by a leg-of-mutton
supper with trimmings. The A.I.F. Steel
Helmet Shield is competed for annually
by Digger members of golf clubs.
First in the array of manly beauty that
Frith has limned is Harry Ferguson. He
is an advertising expert, as one can per-
ceive from the fact that he wears the
uniform of the brigade, horn-rimmed
spectacles. He is a middle-marker with
a very fair command of his game, and
a notable yarn-spinner withal. He served
in the war with the Maoriland forces,
and is naturally a Rugby Union en-
thusiast. Monty Chambers, whose pol-
ished brow gleams at the observer, is
chairman of the house committee. Off
the links he is managing director of
Bebarfalds. As a golfer, he is never
off the fairway. He holds all club records
for slow dressing in the locker-room, and
more than once it has been suggested
that the club might boast a world’s cham-
pion in this field if a challenge were
thrown out to the golf clubs of creation.
George Mason, whose bright smile
haunts all who meet him, is No. 3 on
Frith’s parade. One of the new men, his
plus-fours are justly famous, and he has
no trouble in maintaining the fashionable
slimness for which some other members
strive in vain. He is a regular member
of the B-grade team. George Mason is
a chemist. Bertie French, No. 4, is
champion of the club and a dentist in his
working hours. On the 7 mark, he plays
a strong, consistent game. He is noted
as the noisiest member in the locker-
room, but the subject-matter is usually
worth listening to, since he is a wag.
Allan Black, No. 5, is a long-hitting
left-hander, and a low-marker. He is
young yet, and is expected to improve
into a class player. He is a Mick
Simmons man, and his attire is as that
of the lilies of the field. George Brown,
who comes after, is a well-known electri-
cian and does good service on the com-
mittee. His cubic content is remarkable,
and no one will be surprised to hear he
was a Q.M.S, in the A.I.F. He is a surfer
of note, and in golf hits a long but
slightly-erratic ball. On a middle mark,
he considers he should be on the limit,
but you know what handicappers are.
Next comes Dr. Yorke Pittar, of
Hampden Court, a sound golfer, playing
off the 11 mark, and a quiet, likeable
member. The doctor is one of those who
are beginning to realise that any ambition
they may have had to become light-
weight jockeys may now be dismissed.
No. 8 is Tom White, another com-
paratively recent addition to the club.
He is of an incurably jovial disposition,
and, sad to say, extends his sense of
humor to golf, which, as all the elect
know, is heresy. Anyway, he doesn’t
lie awake at nights because he is a long-
marker. He, too, is approaching the
Camera class, but that doesn’t faze him
any more than his golf.
A. T. (“Toby”) Barton, is secretary.
His picture, No. 9, shows him as wear-
ing a worried look. Though he has to
run two clubs at once this is far from
his usual expression, for he has a good
poker face, which he perhaps picked up
in the A.I.F. For years “Toby” was a
Manly alderman, and he was president of
the Village Rugby Union club before the
siren of golf seduced him away. He is
a useful golfer, playing from the 11 mark.
No. 10, Bill Roche, of Texas Oil, might,
if he weren’t Bill Roche, have been sus-
pected of playing under wraps, for his
handicap had recently to be cut from 17
to 9. The explanation is that he had to
drop out of the game for some time;
he is now reaping the reward of his
earlier training. In the last club cham-
pionship he came from behind and made
a splash with 79 off the stick. The cow-
lick curl which Frith depicts is a notable
feature of Bill’s get-up.
No. 11 is H. B. Whitham, president and
chairman of the club committee. He is a
medium-mark golfer, and is never known
to use a wooden club; and he is an
excellent host. An Englishman, he is
managing director of Western News-
papers and president of the Country Press
Association. Jim Black, No. 12, has
J.A.M. for his full initials, but there is
no evidence of it in his demeanor. Popu-
lar with all hands, he is an engineer, and
is, of course, a Scot. Note the Jardineish
determination in his portrait.
Alan Kippax, who has drawn No. 13
marble, needs no introduction to a world
which follows cricket. He is a better
batsman than golfer, but there are signs
that, like other great batsmen, he will
develop his golf to a higher pitch. He
is a sporting outfitter, of course, and as
well liked on the links as on the cricket
field. Ward Booth is a son of Gordon
Booth, and is in his father’s printing
business. Only 21, he plays on the 11
mark and shows promise of going much
further back. He has just returned from
a trip to Ceylon, where he found the
manhood maligned by the poet and the
golf far from vile. W. D. (“Bill”) Mc-
Clure is connected with Dalgety’s.
Another of the younger members, he is
as keen as mustard on his game, though
he is still high on the handicaps.
No. 16 is Gordon Booth, one of the
founders of the club and original com-
mitteemen. He is a steady player off
the 12 mark, and his work on the social
side of the club has much to do with its
success. He is a keen member of the
Royal Automobile Club. Frank Tollett,
who is next in order, is one of the best
of the middle-markers, and it is probably
his characteristic modesty which has pre-
vented his entering for a beauty com-
petition.
Dr. D’Arcy Williams, the Mac-
quarie-street eye specialist, plays a good
game and is the most inveterate golfing
theorist in captivity. A Hercules in
physique (he is No. 18), he is another
member of the Royal Automobile Club.
Frank B. Smith comes next. He plays
on one of the forward marks and is not
likely to drop back far. He is a bosom
friend of Adolph Basser ; in golf, as in
this drawing, the pair are never separated.
F.B.S. has oil interests and spends much
time in Java and Malaya. A good host
and a generous friend.
Adolph Basser, last on the screen, but
not least in the matter of club standing
or in plus-fours, is managing director of
Saunders, the jewellers. To the fore in all
club activities, he donated the ’Tween
Decks Cup. He is a long-marker, but
takes his golf seriously, spending most
of hi„s spare time on the links under pro-
fessional guidance.

The severe economic stress that from time to time affects
the whole world comes in cycles. The progress of Aus-
tralia's economic development has been temporarily
retarded by three periods of acute depression.
Upon the Bank of New South Wales, as the leading financial
institution in Australia for the past 116 years, has fallen
to a great extent the responsibility of safeguarding the
country's financial structure during these periods.
By the consistent application of proved principles of sound
banking practice the Bank has always completely safe-
guarded its depositors and on all occasions has extended
the maximum possible assistance to trade and industry.
Bank of New South Wales

The Other Fellow’s Mind.
“Lao-dah”: Here is a tip for the Mel-
bourne City Council in its rat-catching
activities. A box of oysters was con-
signed to a man at a shipping office.
Some of the oysters relaxed while wait-
ing, and some rats began to explore their
possibilities. In a few minutes half a
dozen of them were surely grasped by
bivalves and fell a prey to the office-boy.

“H.N.J.”: Australian timbers, cor-
rectly seasoned and milled, are equal to
the world’s best; but air-dried timber is
sold as kiln-dried, and thus the trade
suffers. Every piece of timber purporting
to be kiln-dried should be branded as
such, and the percentage of moisture it
was dried to should also be given. Kiln-
dried timber will hold its size and shape
indefinitely ; the air-dried stuff will warp,
shrink and check.
H= * * *
“J.D.”: Tas. Rotarians have set a good
example by running a “Spend for Em-
ployment” campaign. They aimed at the
securing of definite promises to spend
£20,000 on new work or material in
four months. Within a week they were
able to announce that the mark had been
passed, and it has since been distanced.
* H: * *
“Arogun”: Quick freezing has arrived,
and I suggest that it has a great future
if we make the most of our opportuni-
ties. A Sydney concern of meat ex-
porters is disposing of its canning plant,
but it has butchers cutting orders for
the islands and another gang freezing
and packing joints and prime cuts. And
other concerns are getting their share of
the growing business.
* * * *
“Clerk”: Depresh hasn’t stimulated
the back-to-the-horse movement in Mel-
bourne, though it has in the country. A
12-hour census taken at Prince’s, Queen’s
and Spencer-street bridges gave 36,232
motor vehicles, 6151 bicycles, 2530 trams
and 2629 horse-drawn chariots. The
increase in 12 months was 9.6 p.c. for
cars and 36.6 p.c. for push-bikes. The
gee-gees had dropped back 16.7 p.c.
ii<
“D.E.”: N.S.W. Transport Department
has been struggling for months with the
question of fixing a flat rate for Sydney
taxi rides, but can’t make up its mind —
or hadn’t done so when this was written.
Meanwhile, the charges vary from Is. 6d.
at flag-fall and Is. 6d. a mile to 9d. and
9d. I have never been able to under-
stand the flag-fall exaction, and Is. 6d.
a mile is sheer extortion with petrol so
cheap. A shilling seems a fair thing.
* * *
“Raeakiaki”: Forgan Smith’s Govern-
ment has allocated £250,000 for the erec-
tion of 450 workers’ dwellings, princi-
pally because of the urgency of provid-
ing jobs for persons in the building and
allied trades. Maoriland has tackled the
problem more satisfactorily. Its unem-
ployed board pays a subsidy up to one-
third of award wages in respect of all
workers engaged on buildings ; on dwel-
lings costing £650 or less a 50 per cent,
subsidy is payable. The men work a
40-hour week.
* * * *
“J.H.McD.”: If it is right to shelter
the sugar-grower, it must be right to
shelter the producer of butter. There
are thousands more families depending
on the cow than on sugar-cane. Does
the city man realise that to-day the dairy-
farmer gets on an average ss. for 20
gallons of milk at, say, 3.6 butter-fat
test; that is, around 3d. per gallon?
What is wrong with a fixed minimum
price at the factory for the producer,
side by side with a fixed retail price to
the consumer?
* * * *
“Te Kapo”: It should be part of the
Commonwealth’s copyright law that
every book must bear the year of
publication on its title-page. Street maps
and tourist guides rarely give this infor-
mation, with the result that out-of-date
works are foisted on the public Assured
by the assistant that they were the very
latest, I went through a bundle of Syd-
ney maps and guides. Only two contained
a map showing the street alterations con-
sequent upon the erection of the Harbor
Bridge.
* * * H:
“Jeviel”: The landing of that Italian
squadron at Chicago from the other side
of the Atlantic (B. 26/7/’33) shows that
our isolation is now an obsolete protec-
tion against air attack. Considering its
population, Australia probably has more
young men willing to take to the air than
any other country. When the R.A.A.F.
called for cadets in 1931 the required
dozen had to be chosen from an eager
3000. Yet our Air Force consists mainly
of empty hangars and obsolete ’planes.
In a comparatively brief period the
R.A.A.F. has written off ’planes to the
value of £50,000 through crashes and
deterioration. There have been no re-
placements.

NORTH OF
TWENTY-EIGHT
Townsville on Progress
“Magnetic”: “Pundi” (B. 19/7/’33)
said a few words for the progress of
Cairns. Now let me speak of the growth
which has taken place in Townsville,
despite its much-advertised railway
strikes, parades of Bolshies in Flinders-
street and occasional alligators on the
G.P.O. verandah—which, by the way,
never bite tourists.
Thirteen years ago we had a popula-
tion of 21,348 ; in 1932, 31,000 was the
number. Our exports grew from £880,538
in 1920 to £1,810,557 in 1931-32. Cus-
toms and excise revenue developed
between the same years from £92,625 to
£214,754, while imports came down from
£440,422 to £325,048. Our outgoing ton-
nage has increased two and a half times.
Cultivation in the Petty Sessions districts
of Townsville, Ayr, Charters Towers and
Ingham has grown from 53,292 acres to
98,095 acres. The total area under crop
has more than doubled, and 800,000 tons
of cane will be cut hereabouts this year,
against 323,000 in 1920. And are we
going to take any notice of the puling
people who shout that the only way of
saving the world is to reduce production?
No, sir.
One of our leading commercial
bodies the other day urged “that we
should set ourselves the task of doubling
our figures for production again in the
next decade,” and adds:
The most important lesson we have learnt
from the depression is the tremendous influence
the agricultural and pastoral industries have
on the solvency of the nation.... We, in Aus-
tralia, are not suffering from the effects of
over-production but from under-consumption,
if we can live up to a “double-it-each-
decade” programme we’ll have a bigger
export trade than the present one of
any of the States of the Commonwealth
(bar N.S.W. and Vic.) passing through
Townsville by the year 2033, and Towns-
ville will have a population of 400,000.
“Limestone”: Ipswich has always
looked on coaly Bunaamba next door with
horror as the place where strikes happen,
but it can no longer crow. An alderman
of its City Council has suggested a muni-
cipal strike against the local electricity
supply authority, which is in difficulty
with some section of the burghers, in the
form of shutting off the city lighting for
a week. Such a stoppage would do less
harm than in most places. Virtue is the
other name of Ipswich, which once

aspired to be the port and capital of
Queensland, and the main danger would
be that one might in the murk wander
into the wrong church.
*.* * *
‘ Seebi : Some people have hard luck.
An 18-year-old lad was killed at Long-
reach last week who deserved a better
fate. Securing a union ticket at Mildura
early in the year, he set out to find work,
He travelled 2000 miles before he found
it on July 18, at Bexley station. The next
morning his horse dashed him against
a tree and killed him. If he had been
content to sit at home telling the Gov-
ernment that the dole for single men
was inadequate, and filling in his spare
moments with housey-housey, he would
still be alive, and the agitators would
love him , but fortunately, Australia, and
particularly the North, has thousands of
self-reliant lads like him.
* * * *
“X 238”: In case any of the fraternity
feel like calling on old friends when they
go up to work the Brisbane Show, they
had better know that Police Head-
quarters has been moved from the
St. John’s Cathedral Church House, in
which it has lived from the time when
half the police force were guardsmen
and honorables, to the more plebeian
headquarters formerly occupied by the
Prisons Department, in the Treasury
Block, a locality which in itself is a
broad hint to the wicked. The quarters
are more commodious than the old ones ;
but pity the poor inebriate who has to
reach them. Anybody who can climb the
front Treasury steps and then repeat
without tripping the words “Does the
Home Secretary’s indispensable Police
Commissioner reside in this edifice?”
is indubitably sober.
* * * *
“Tanumbirini”: I forgive “L. R. Russ”
(B. 5/7/’33) for misunderstanding me on
the question of water and settlement,
because he evidently has a practical
knowledge of what he talks about. The
lands I have in mind for more intensive
settlement through water provision are
not around Coward Springs or south of
Lake Eyre. All that country is a problem
for the thirtieth century rather than the
twentieth. In fact, I doubt if it will be
worth settling then, if the experience of
the Persian Lut, the Sinai and the Bikanir
deserts, which are no worse, go for any-
thing. Neither do I think that the coun-
try north of Alice Springs and south of
the Tennant will be much use. But I do
believe that there are areas on the north-
ern tableland of the Territory, and in the
pastoral west of Queensland, plus some
parts of Central and Northern Queens-
land inside the Dividing Range, which
could be turned to profitable agricultural
use with irrigation. It is only the plums
which should be developed first—the
blocks 100 miles square.

R. W. Robson, who edits the “Pacific
Monthly,’ has completed the 1933 edi-
tion of the “Handbook of the Western
Pacific” • (Pacific Publications ; 2s. 9d.),
a reasonably-priced vade mecum of 208
pages of detailed information about
every phase of island life. Prefaced by
a short historical and descriptive section,
it includes complete Governmental direc-
tories of the chief territories, lists of
Government employees and residents of
the various groups and of Papua, the
New Guinea Mandated Territory and
Norfolk Island, and trade, Customs tariff,
radio and shipping information. It is
an indispensable little volume for any-
body who wishes to trade with the Pacific
communities.
* * * *
“Herbertshohe”: One of the problems
confronting the Mandated Territory is
the future of the Chinese boy. There
are twice as many Chinese in Rabaul as
white people in the whole of N.G., and
the number reaching school-leaving age
increases yearly. Some find jobs as
clerks; others follow the trades and
occupations of their relatives, tailoring,
trading, cafe-keeping, car-driving and
carpentering. There is still a surplus,
and it has been suggested that this turn
its attention to domestic service. The
New Guinea houseboy or cook is easily
the world’s worst, while the Chinaman
is famous from his own country to Peru
as the ideal domestic servant. Employers
would have to pay the Chinaman higher
wages than the average native ruffian
gets, but he would be well worth it in
trouble and money saved in housekeep-
ing. It would not be a dead-end job,
either.

Bob Crane has called it a day at 74
after 50 years with the Rockhampton
“Bulletin,” the first newspaper on which
James Edmond was employed in Aus-
tralia. Crane arrived in Rockhampton
from Langport (Eng.) in 1883, became a
“I believe your boss is sending you to the Dogs’ Home."
“Ho! An’ where’ull they send him, I’d like to know, when I bring up about
my unpaid license?”

Mrs. Agnes Brown, who recently died
at Beaudesert (Q.) in her 101st year, was
Queensland’s oldest female inhabitant.
Born in Scotland, she arrived in Queens-
land in 1883 with her husband, the late
Alexander Brown, who was one of the
Beaudesert pioneers.

“Doondi”: The Queensland nut is at
last coming into its own, and so soon as
commercial type can be fixed it is cer-
tain to prove as popular as the old-estab-
lished pecan. Hawaii already has several
hundred acres planted with the trees,
some of which are eight years old. Now
Nyasaland has asked for specimens. The
ideal nut which is being aimed for is
large with a thin shell, but so far seed-
lings cannot be relied on to produce a
standardised article.

“Goode Island”: Thursday Island’s
lightship, the Carpentaria, is becoming
almost as much a terror to seamen as the
Flying Dutchman. Thanks to the Torres
tides and winds, she refuses to stay put.
Not long ago the Nieuw Holland found
her 18 miles off the Proudfoot shoal
which she should have been guarding.
A little while afterwards she was re-
trieved by the Clan Mackay 60 miles
from home—and a nice time the Clan
boat had getting her in seeing that she
has no steering gear. By the time she
had fouled the rescuer’s propellers a few
times and broken three or four hawsers,
everybody on the Clan Mackay wished
her at the bottom of the sea.
Gals’ Gossip from Brisbane
Tom Bavin, ex-Premier, was amongst
the throng invading Queensland in search
of sunshine. He arrived on the same
train as Comrade Scullin —so far as is
known, without any serious disturbance.
Over 300 dancers turned up for the
Dunlop-Perdriau ball at the Trocadero.
Officials on the list included Melbourne
director Daniell and visitors from Mary-
borough, Bundaberg, Rockhampton and
Toowoomba.
It was just too bad that rain fell so
heavily the day of the annual meeting
of the Creche and Kindergarten. The
committee had arranged tea for over 200.
but the hall was very sparingly filled.
Nevertheless, those who did don rain-
coats and attend were thoroughly inter-
ested in the Governor’s speech. Although
at present he thinks there is no one so
deserving of money as the Boy Scout,
he did admit that kindergarten work was
important. A. E. Moore, ex-Mayor Jolly,
Home-Secretary Hanlon and Dr. Bostock
all made pretty speeches.
Lord Mayor Greene decked his recep-
tion-room in poinsettia, and invited a few
citizens, political and otherwise, to greet
the Scullins. The guest of honor said
nice things about Queensland’s hospi-
tality ; then Percy Pease spoke up in
place of Forgan Smith, who is away, and
then Moore had his turn. It was a
happy gathering, with politics hardly dis-
cussed.
Mother and daughter, Mrs. W. F. Gar-
diner and her Janet, again met in the
championship finals on the Royal Queens-
land golf links. This has happened for
the last three years. In 1931 mother beat
daughter ; in 1932 Janet beat Mrs. Gardi-
ner, and this week Mrs. Gardiner was
again the champion. On the Shirley links,
Christchurch (M.L.) some years ago a
competition took place between grand-
mothers and grandfathers, showing what
a great game this is for people of all
ages and both sexes.
Philip Hargrave has had crowded
audiences at every concert he has given.
After each performance crowds wait at
the stage door to peep at the unperturbed
wonder. When he steps into his car
(usually hugging a gigantic box of candy)
he slowly waves and bows, and the crowd
disperses thoroughly satisfied with such
recognition. It is a solemn sight.
Sir Leslie Wilson’s Scout fund is to
benefit by a Scout Week carnival in Sep-
tember. Soon after his Ex. gave a gentle
little hint to the public that he was going
to open a fund, pounds, shillings and
pence rolled in. Now Mrs. A. E. Moore
is putting in all her energies in running
the show.
The late Nell Douglas’s friends intend
to establish a scholarship for elocution
in her name. The Art Theatre, which
she founded, put on “Berkeley Square”
at Cremorne Theatre, and Mrs. P. J.
Symes, Mary Kessell, Marjorie Mant and
Walter Pym appeared.
Colonel Dan Evans and his missus
spread the table at a big dinner party
at the Bellevue for the Blaikie-Websters,
who are having a great fuss made of
them. The W. F. Gardiners fed them
with waffles one morning, and the George
Mocattas gave a cocktail party in their
honor.
’Midst Iceland poppies and gum-tips
the Brisbane Women’s Club got together
the members for bridge, and thereby the
Adult Blind, Deaf and Dumb Mission
will greatly benefit.
Dickensians love to meet to listen and
read the works of the great writer. Bar-
bara Sisley stage-managed an evening’s
programme of dramatic work which in-
cluded scenes from “Barnaby Rudge,”
“Oliver Twist” and “The Old Curiosity
Shop.”
Dr. Alan Vickers, the flying doctor
(he’s the pioneer of the Australian In-
land Mission’s aerial medical service) of
the far north-west, sprang a surprise upon
us the other day when he announced his
engagement to Lilias Whitman, of Clon-
curry.
Knowing his India well and truly—he
held down a gubernatorial job in Bom-
bay for five years—our Ex., Sir Leslie
Wilson, gave the Victoria League a de-
lightful hour’s talk on the conditions and
problems of Gandhiland. Ex-Premier
Arthur Moore moved the vote of thanks,
rounding off a pleasant evening with
some characteristic whimsicalities. The
League is doing very good work in Bris-
bane. Besides the Moores there were
present Lady McCaul, W. E. Graham (in
the chair), looking amiable and venerable
as is his wont, Lady Mayoress Greene
and the League’s secretary, Miss Coch-
rane.
A. S. Hicks, Queensland Bank of New
South Wales inspector, is gathering
valued clients and others to dine with
general manager A. C. Davidson at
Lennon’s on the sth, there, no doubt,
to discuss the late World Economic Con-
ference and the present rate of exchange.

The Truth
About Catarrh
Remedies Galore
You have, no doubt, tried dozens of
remedies, but you are still looking for the
one that will give you happy relief. The
one remedy you have not tried is waiting
for you—a preparation containing vola-
tile oils known as Catarrk-Clysmac. This
new volatile oil treatment has proved a
boon to thousands of sufferers through-
out Australia. They have found its value
for chronic cold in the head as well as
for Catarrh in its more serious stages.
Tt has been so thoroughly tested and
nroved so consistently true that the
monev paid for the first package will be
refunded if it does not do what is
claimed. Catarrh-Clysmac can be bought
from any chemist for 1/9 or nearly three
times the quantity for 4/6.
A WOMAN'S
LETTER
The show at the Royal seems to have
started it, and now there’s music in the
air wherever you turn. Last week, the
arpeggios, the cadenzas and the gargling
larynxes ran amok, and, not content with
the studio and the student, the Conserva-
torium and the musicianly-minded citi-
zen, they thrust themselves under the
very nose of the city’s most prosperous
and most glitteringly manicured. On
one night alone, the Mayoral Hagons
threw open the civic drawing-rooms for
a musical; the Royal Empire Society
forgathered in gorgeous frocking against
a lavishly-beflowered background for the
express purpose of listening to music ;
up at Paling’s the members of the Sver-
jensky Club, many of them students by
night and city toilers by day, put on a
Beethoven programme in excellent style,
and at the Prince Edward the star turn
was Dagmar Roberts at the piano. Earlier
in the afternoon, Peter Dawson’s concert
had filled the Town Hall.
At eight-thirty last Wednesday night
the Wentworth presented, as it were, a
curtain-raiser to the Lewisham Hospi-
tal Ball. Over the vice-regal table
to the left of the dais Miss K. Egan
and Dr. Walter Burfitt hovered, seeing
that every particular was just right. On
the middle of this table were banked lily-
of-the-valley and pink camellias that
glowed aloof, yet provocative, against
the dark lustrous green of their leaves.
The noonday sky-blue of Miss Egan’s
feather boa which gambolled across one
shoulder-strap of her trigly-fitting black
moire was in strong contrast. Across the
room walked Mrs. Walter Burfitt, presi-
dent of the committee, carrying the fan-
shaped posy that later decked the hand
of Lady Game. It was a delicate thing
of lily-of-the-valley, violets and pink
camellias; but its coloring failed to dim
the Chinese embroideries on Mrs. Bur-
fitt’s coat. Esmey Burfitt, down from
Queensland for the occasion, was slim
and attractive in rose pink ; Mollie and
Eileen Hollingdale were busy collecting
their party ; Dr. Witton Flynn and his
wife presided over the long, flower-
decked table at the end of the room ;
railway chief T. J. Hartigan and Mrs.
held court just inside the door-
way.
At nine o’clock Sir Philip and Lady
Game arrived, the latter looking crystal-
cool in silver lame. Italy’s Consul-
General, with his black-velvet-clad Mar-
chesa, and the Mayoral Hagons (the
civic hostess’s peony crepe frock was
much admired) were other social heavy-
weights of the night. Doctors were on
every side, both male and female of the
species. Nor must the frock worn by
Dr. Langdon’s wife be overlooked. It
had red velvet roses embossed on a paler
ground, and was worn under a white fur
coat.
Novelist Helen Simpson has lost, by
death, an aunt whose memories of other
days no doubt helped to germinate the
seed of “Boomerang.” The lady was
Martha Margaret Simpson, widow of
Justice George Simpson. She had lived
in Darling Point-road for half of her 90
years. A niece, Sister Millicent Steuart
Cobcroft, of Summer Hill, one of the
splendid A.I F war nurses, predeceased
her aunt by a few days. Sister Cobcroft,
who was a trainee of the Coast Hospital,
served with the 14th Australian General
Hospital at Abassia.
The Music Week teas will have an
international flavor if the arrange-
ments of the committee’s president,
Charles Philp, and co-worker Frank
Hutchens run to plan. The idea is to
have one of the consular ladies to act
as hostess to each session. The red-
gold nimbus of Ray Fox’s hair will
shine above her mellow fiddle when, with
Charles’s piano and Athos Martelli’s
’cello, it sings through a programme of
modern music. There’s an absolute feast
of harmony to be spread from the 21st
to the 25th. Alfred Hill’s Cavaliers, Voss
Janssen’s string quartet, Cyril Monk,
Constance Burt, Daisy Mangan, Trixie
Tange and Lindley Evans are among the
glittering galaxy of names on all-star
programmes.
Sydney has been making the acquaint-
ance of an attractive visitor from
Queensland. She is Alison McPhie, the
youngest doughter of Alec McPhie,
of Toowoomba. Alison has been stay-
ing with Mrs. Hubert Fairfax, but, since
that lady is setting out on a trip to West-
ralia, the young Queenslander goes off to
Mrs. Gordon White at Point Piper.
Mrs. G. C. Veal, who arrived here
last week from Maoriland, where she
had been private secretary to Lady Bledis-
loe, wife of the Dominion’s G.-G., was
shown the sights of Sydney (natural, not
human) by Lady Game last week. Mrs.
Veal put up at Government House dur-
ing her stay, and went off to England
last Saturday. One of the plays she saw,
under vice-regal escort, during her Syd-
ney holiday was the Independents’ pro-
duction of “London Wall” in aid of the
Far West Children’s Health Scheme.
Olma Osborne and Bill Gordon, whose
marriage was dated for St. Mark’s at
Darling Point just as this Letter was
getting into its pink sheath, had many
cocktails drained in their honor last
Week. The Osborne clan gathered
around with the pre-nuptial shaker, and
the city’s smart young things (many of
them, by the way, do not look on the
wine when it is red) were present at all
the mild whoopees.
Our fourth annual music week is just
around the corner, and violinist Eve
Pascoe (Mrs. Kenneth Hungerford) is
busy organising the musical exhibition
and the morning- and afternoon-tea pro-
grammes that are to be served with it.
The Blaxland Galleries will house the
exhibition and the accompanying frivols,
and two of the interesting turns will be
Miss Pascoe’s recital of early English
music and her lecture on the development
of stringed instruments, illustrated by pas-
sages on such variations of the tautened
bow-string as the viol d’amour, the viol
da Gamba and the Hindustani Sarinda.
The body of the last is a hollowed gourd
showing the lotus design and its sym-
pathetic strings are the same as those of
the viol d’amour. Which suggests that,
as far. as the serenading troubadour was
concerned, the colonel’s lady and the
dusky belle by the Euphrates were sisters
under their skins. Photo from Falk.
Evelyn Perry, just 19 and the eldest
child of the George Perrys, of Gunning-
bar, Mullengudgery, out near Nevertire,
has just engaged herself to Dugald Ken-
nedy, who has a station property at Gil-
gandra. Dugald is an old Geelong Gram-
mar boy and the son of the Kennedys,
of Wandinong station, Urana way. The
Perry family are among the big wool-
growers of the State. Many of them live
round about Warren, but Evelyn s branch
of the family is nearer to Nevertire.
Grace Simpson, the Sydney girl with
the coloratura soprano, sang to Peter
Dawson the other day, and Peter
declared the voice to be the best he had
heard in recent years. Grace, who is a
pupil of Leslie MacCallum, will make
her first public appearance at the Con-
servatorium to-morrow night.
Herewith Dulcie Cohen, who won the
prizes for the N.S.W. song and the two-
part song section for children’s voices in
the A.B.C. competitions for composers.
Dulcie is a daughter of Sydney’s Rabbi,
who is an authority on Hebrew music and
is himself a composer of merit. This
popular Sydney girl has been writing
music since her girlhood ; some of her
early works are still being sung by
Dorothy Helmrich to London audiences.
In the Verbrugghen regime at the Conser-
vatorium she was considered by the Bel-
gian director one of his most brilliant
students, and he, who allowed no liber-
ties, even permitted Dulcie to imperson-
ate him and conduct an orchestra in the
Verbrugghen style as one of the draws of
a charity matinee. As well as being a.
writer of music, Dulcie is an actress of
talent, one of her best performances
being Lady Beaconsfield in the Indepen-
dents’ production of “Disraeli.”
Last week A. Smith, in whose work-
shop in Hunter-street hundreds of beauti-
ful violins have been born, told the his-
tory of the instrument with such a
wealth of detail as only love of his sub-
ject could inspire to the members of the
Musical Association. The drawing-room
of the Forum Club was crowded for
the lecture, which was complete with lan-
tern slides showing violins from the
earliest to present-day models. The audi-
ence felt linked with the families of
Stradivarius, Amati and Guarneri when
it saw in shadow the handiwork of these
great artists which such concert favorites
as Balokovic, Zimbalist and Kubelik had
played in our midst. A picture of a
violin made by Stradivarius when he was
91 was one of the breath-takers of the
evening. Cyril Monk and Gerald Walenn
illustrated the tone not only of violins
by the old craftsmen but of one made by
Griffin, a pupil of Mr. Smith, whose
daughter, incidentally, is being initiated
into all her father’s secrets.
There’s to be an Artists’ Ball in the
early spring. It was decided on last
Monday afternoon, when no fewer than
200 artists, near-artists and mere soolers-
on gathered at the Australia. Here over
the teacups plans were discussed, and
one of the most amiable meetings on
record (perhaps the hot buttered crum-
pets lubricated the working) ended with
the decision to go gay in David Jones’s
and to let Fred Leist, Rayner Hoff, Dave
Souter, Charlie Westmacott and many
others loose on the decorations.
Young couples will be interested in
the way the J. M. McPhillamys, of
Bathurst (she was the eldest daughter of
the Bertie Kellys), announced the arrival
of their first-born. A white card, in the
top left-hand corner of which an adven-
turous baby swings by its shawl from
the branch of a cherry-tree in bloom,
announces in cherry lettering
The safe arrival of a little daughter on July
22, 1933, weight Bj-lb., whose name will be
Veronica Beatrice.
The card is sent out in the name of the
parents and of the fond grandmother,
Mrs. Bertie Kelly, who arrived from
Italy to be on the spot to greet the new-
comer.
If you were air-minded you went
along to the Blaxland Galleries last week,
to the Aero Club Ball, and wore the jazz
cap in the two blues and red of the club
which a thoughtful committee had pro-
vided. There were tiny-models of aero-
planes on each table, and at the end of
the room was a glittering array of
trophies won by members during the
year. These were handed out later in
the evening by the club’s president,
Flight-lieutenant S. J. Moir, accompanied
by appropriate remarks. The Mayoral
Hagons came on to this happy meeting
after they had paid their respects to the
Lewisham Ball ; Major de Havilland and
Mrs. de Havilland, whose frock was
vividly patterned in red and black, the
Kingsford-Smiths, the Geoffrey Hughes
couple, she very sparkling in parchment
satin edged with mink, and Mrs. Geoff
King, whose white frock flowed out be-
neath a white velvet coat, were a few
who swayed and stepped under the drift-
ing shower of blue and red and green
balloons. The Squadron-leader Wacketts,
the S. C. Bridglands—he’s secretary of
the club—and Mrs. S. J. Tyler, president
of the women’s committee which helped
to organise the dance, were others who
caught the attention.
The youngsters all declare that “Shore”
Old Boys’ dance was the best of the
season. And a lot of the gaiety they gen-
erously credit to Cec Morrison, who,
just back from his travels in America and
Europe, led an orchestra as effervescent
as a new siphon of soda water. There
were new tunes to lure the feet of youth,
among them some of Gee’s own composi-
tions. The Blaxland Galleries, where
the party raged till about three o’clock
last Saturday morning, simply seethed
with dancers, who kept two bands going
their hardest.
A latticed canopy of blue and white
streamers waved above the heads of over
a thousand joyseekers; and “Shore’s”
banner and torch were repeated 'again
and again in the decorations. On the
official table three goldenly-glowing
torches rose from a base of gumtips, gold-
lacquered for effect. Gordon Turnbull,
president of the 0.8. U., was accompanied
by his mother, who acted as hostess, and
at their table sat a great company of
representatives of the city’s G.P.S. Head-
master Robson and his good-looking wife
were among the night’s hosts ; there were
groups of young doctors, hoping there’d
be no sudden call from the women’s hos-
pitals ; Adrian Curlewis and his wife
brought many friends with them ; Elise
Budge was a picture in camellia-pink
organdie, her little tight velvet jacket
having its sleeves of the frilled material;
another who looked like a pink sugar-
plum fairy was Cyris McColm, of Bris-
bane.

Moonee Valley got a little sunshine at
a week-end that threatened to be wet, but
racegoers didn’t make it a dressy occa-
sion. White or putty-colored macintoshes,
topcoats and tailored suits, largely tweed,
were favored with the most sedate of felt
hats or toques. A wintry touch to the table
decorations of Iceland poppies and white
heather at the committee luncheon were
trails of holly. Among the guests at the
midday meal were General Chauvel and
his lady, she in a brown wool georgette
gown with a matching felt toque and a
long fawn cloth coat; Colonel and Mrs.
H. Cohen ; Dr. and Mrs. F. Clendennin ;
Mrs. B. O. Sullivan, whose black suit
was finished with a collar of snow leop-
ard ; Mr. and Mrs. A. G. Hunter ; Mr.
and Mrs. C. J. Coles of Adelaide ; Dr.

The Vic.. Scottish Regiment, founded in
1897 by Malcolm McEacharn, had a
birthday dance in the drill hall in con-
junction with an exhibition of historical
Scottish relics and the cups and other
bits of silver won in service sports by
the brigade with which this regiment is
linked. Prominent among the exhibits was
a silver statuette of a Gordon Highlander,
a gesture of comradeship from Sir lan
Hamilton. Scarlet mess jackets and other
uniforms made a bright showing. Glanc-
ing upon the kaleidoscopic parade of
feminine dancers, an officer recalled that
in the long ago it was an understood
thing that women attending a military
ball should wear either black or white,
leaving it to their partners to supply
color. Lieut.-Col. W. H. Mathieson, C.O.
of the regiment, brought Mrs. Mathie-
son, who wore a gown of black velvet.
The lady was deputed to cut the birth-
day cake with its 36 candles while pipers
played. Major H. A. Campbell was
there, also Brigadier-General Brand and
his daughter, Brigadier-General McColl,
Lt.-Colonel Armstrong, Colonel D. A.
Luxton and Mrs. Luxton, Major and Mrs.
R. T. A. McDonald and Lt.-Colonel and
Mrs. T. W. White. An ex-Gordon
Highlander present was G. R. Whitton,
who was accompanied by his daughter.
Major T. P. Cook, organiser of the suc-
cessful dance, was there with Mrs. Cook,
whose draperies were black. It was
announced during the evening that after
nearly four decades of unsuccessful
pleading the regiment had won the right
to wear the kilt.
This is Dorothy, daughter of Dr. and
Mrs. H. V. Mattingley, of Camberwell.
She is a Mus.Bac. of Melb. Uni. and a
talented pianist and ’cellist. She was firstly
a pupil of Ada Freeman at the Albert-
street Con., having won an exhibition
there, and later passed on to the Uni.
Con., where her teacher was Edward
poll. For four years she played the
cello in the Uni. Symphony Orchestra,
I now merged in the Melbourne Sym-
phony Orchestra.
For the Commercial Travellers’ hop
St. Kilda Town Hall was prinked up
with verdure and festoons of colored
lights, the badge of the association stand-
ing out in clear illumination. Official
guests were George Grant, president of
the Vic. association and also of the
United C.T.A. of Australia, who was
accompanied by his wife, whose frock
was cornflower blue, and his daughter,
whose ice-green angel-skin gown sported
a dash of poinsettia red. J. B. Wallace,
president of the Ballarat C.T.A. Social
Club, was there with Mrs. Wallace, who
wore a black lace gown. The general
secretary of the U.C.T.A., C. A. M. West,
came with Mrs. West, whose lace gown
was of leaf-green shade.
The Old Paradians’ dance at St. Kilda
Town Hall was attended by about 600.
Thirty-six debs, carried posies of purple
pansies and soft green foliage—the
school’s colors. There was a set of
lancers for the buds and their partners,
supervised by Mrs. J. A. Gorman, who
was in a lace gown of ficelle tint. The
comers-out made their curtsies to the
president of the 0.P., G. L. Belleville,
who was accompanied by Mrs. Belleville,
in begonia-pink velvet.
Past students of Genazzano Convent
danced at No. 9, the organising com-
mittee being headed by Mrs. G. Ren-
wick, whose dull satin crystal blue robe
had a small cape of velvet. Secretaries
were Mary Condon, whose gown was
tourmaline-pink chiffon, and Mrs. F.
Trinca, whose draperies of lace were of
a deep biscuit tone.
Broothorn here pictures the wife of
Dr. N. A. Albiston, of East Malvern, be-
fore her marriage Margaret Sutherland,
well-known as pianist, teacher and com-
poser. Hailing from Adelaide, she re-
ceived her first lessons in composition
from Fritz Hart, and later studied in
London under Arnold Bax. Much of
her work has been performed in Mel-
bourne and has earned high praise. In
the A.B.C. competitions she won three
prizes, one a “special.” Mrs. Albis-
ton has been chief pianoforte teacher at
the Uni. Con. since Edward Goll became
seriously ill some months ago.
The R.A.C. Ball at the Wattle Path,
St. Kilda, was attended by about 400.
Among the guests were Walter Leitch
and his lady (she in black lace), Colonel
and Mrs. T. W. White, Mayor and
Mayoress Johnson, of St. Kilda, Mr. and
Mrs. Archie Michaelis, Major-General
Blarney, Mrs. E. W. Cox, in grey-blue
georgette, and Mrs. H. J. Robertson, in
draperies of lapis-lazuli shade. President
George Ramsay, with Mrs. Ramsay, who
was robed in deep blue velvet, welcomed
the guests. The jollo was on cabaret
lines and the entertainers were per-
formers in the “Tout Paris” revue.
The Association of Headmistresses met
for dinner at the Homecraft Hostel, Mal-
vern, on Friday night to do honor to
Elsie Morres, for many years head of
The Hermitage, Geelong, who has re-
tired. The colors of The Hermitage
School, green and gold, were to the fore.
At an afternoon bridge party at the
Quamby Club given by Mrs. Leonard
Higgs, au revoir was said to Mrs. Her-
bert Hicks, who is off to England this
week, and a welcome home was extended
to Mrs. A. Cato, back from foreign
travel.
Lud Mayor Gengoult Smith, who is
likely to have a third term and the knight-
hood that usually rewards such service,
is in civic harness again after a very
serious illness. He had a birthday on
the 25th, his forty-third. His fiancee.
Cynthia Brookes, was 21 on the 22nd.
Miss Brookes’s anniversary was cele-
brated with a theatre and supper party.
The young lady’s grandmamma, Mrs.
Harry Emmerton, staged rejoicings at
Raveloe, since Mr. and Mrs. Norman
Brookes, with their other two daughters,
are at Honolulu.
At their Hawthorn home, Tay Creg-
gan, Mr. and Mrs. W. Mortill had
a party in honor of Madame Anna
Elischer and Mrs. Bryson (Florence
Hood). Beautiful flowers decorated the
reception and ballroom and the hostess
wore a caped gown of petal-pink
crinkled crepe. Mrs. W. M. Finley, in
crystal-green satin, and Mrs. Burnett, in
draperies of black lace, were the even-
ing’s vocalists, and Madame Anna
Elischer and Henri Penn the pianists.
Among the listeners were the Hood and
Spencer ladies, the Rene Vanderkelens
and painter George Bell and his wife.
At Rumpelmayer’s members of the
Society of Australian Authors had a
dinner to mark the society’s sixth birth-
day with Bernard Cronin presiding. Molly
Harrison, who sang, and Joan Joske, who
danced, provided entertainment, which
pianist Mauricette Macgillicuddy supple-
mented with some prettily-played Chopin.
Georgie Rivers, who has had a book pub-
lished in England just recently, flitted
around in a pale green taffeta frock with
a velvet coat. Myra Morris sported a
persimmon-colored velvet frock, and
Doris Kerr, in red frock and scarlet vel-
vet coat, assisted hon. sec. A. R. Goode.
Shirley Tweddle, who is in England
with her parents, has embarked upon a
career as an interior decorator with a
London firm.
Gaieties (and solemnities) of Perth:
The Mitchell knight, in his new capacity of
Lieut.-Governor, declared Parliament open. If
the speeches were cold his lady kept herself
warm in a fur coat. Black was the Wittenoom
lady’s choice, and Mrs. Angwin’s; the Nathan
lady chose a wine-red ensemble and Mrs. Kerr-
Pearse black and a fur coat of her favorite
grey. On behalf of President John Kirwan,
Mrs. Geoff Mclntyre, with suggestions of
beige and red relieving her navy-blue rig,
handed teacups around. The Panton family
was at-home in the Speaker’s apartments, Mrs.
Panton wearing Robin Hood green and her
daughter cobalt-blue in a checked pattern.
Song-bird Zoe Lenegan enthralled her audi-
ence in G.-H. ballroom. After several years’
study abroad she has emerged with a mezzo-
contralto of rare beauty. The singer has a
penchant for French composers, 10 Gallic
numbers appearing on her programme. Bur-
gundy lace was her choice for evening gown.
Mr. Leckie accompanied.
The Westralian Bar has swung wide its doors
for Kathleen Hartrey, the fourth young woman
to become fully fledged in law this year. Kath-
leen joins Margaret Battye, forming the second
feminine legal firm in Perth.
Ailsa Nairn and William Carl Robertson
chose a morning wedding in Perth College
chapel. The bride was in Wedgwood-blue
angel-skin with a flower-trimmed diminutive hat
of a matching shade. Her footwear was pearl-
grey and her fingers were hidden in a blue tulle
muff. Attendant ’maid Edna Humphries car-
ried on the color scheme with her crinkly maro-
cain frock. Intimate friends gathered at the
Palace for toasts.
Thrifty women dashed through their bar-
gain-hunting and swarmed to the Town Hall in
search of tips on scientific dressmaking. Such
was the interest in the McCabe School’s demon-
strations that latecomers had standing room
only. Mrs. McCabe and her two male assistants
expounded in theory and practice the virtues
of their system. Awards were made for recent
sewing competitions, special praise being given
to the junior section.
The engagement is announced of Nancy
Riddell, of Claremont, and John Bird, of
Cottesloe.
George Reading, of Bunbury, with vivacious
daughter Mollie under his wing, is off on the
Oronsay for the New Hebrides. Betty Wood
and Barbara Clarke are Perth maidens who
have embarked on the same holiday cruise.
The law students made a night of it at the
Embassy. Supper was spread among wattle and
roses in the restaurant, and a "shower of
balloons embarked on short voyages later in
the evening. Mrs. Lavan chose a black toilette
with white embellishings; Catherine Davies
danced in lemon chiffon and Pat Davies in
crinkly black velvet; Mary Forrest was be-
frilled in shell-pink georgette; scarlet made a
lively dash upon Mrs. Henry Moseley’s ivory
lace; Joye Morrison chose cobalt-blue satin;
Pat Leake and Joan MacLeod were in black;
Grace Drummond’s velvet gown was of glint-
ing brown tones. Feminine legal lights were
Kathleen Hartrey, in blue satin; Mollie King-
stone, in inky velvet, and Sheila McClemans,
in carnation-pink taffetas. -
Adelaide’s parties:
The Kindergarten Ball at the Palais Royal
drew a big crowd. Mrs. H. J. Lipman {presi-
dent) and Nina Sutton (secretary) received Lady
Hore-Ruthven and presented her with a sheaf
of mauve stock. Her Ex. was gowned in
black lace, with sable-trimmed gold brocaded
coat. Mrs. Lipman wore pink flat crepe
trimmed with brown fox fur.
The same night a dance was given by Dr.
and Mrs. William Ray at their home Innisfree,
Glen Osmond. The garden was gay with
multi-colored lights. The host and hostess re-
ceived in the lounge with their son John, for
whom the party was given. The ballroom was
massed with pink roses and the supper tables
arranged with mixed flowers. Mrs. Ray was
gowned in flame-toned marocain. Elder folk
played bridge.
Old Collegians of Scotch College had a
cheery dance at Torrens Park. Huge wood
fires blazed in the picturesque old fireplaces
on either side of the ballroom. The head-
master, N. M. G. Gratton, with his wife, who
wore powder-blue angel-skin lace, and his
pretty daughter Barbara, in wine-toned ting
velvet, saw that everyone had a good time.
Supper was served in the college dining-room,
the tables being decorated with golden poppies
and blue irises, the college colors.
The Junior Red Cross gave a performance
of Quality Street” at Australia Hall to raise
money for maintaining a cottage at the seaside
for children from outback. Thelma Baulder-
stone produced the play and sales of flowers
and sweets helped to swell the funds.
A jigsaw puzzle afternoon was held at the
Piccadilly, organised by the Country Women's
Association to help the Junior Red Cross. Over
170 were present. Mrs. W. T. Mortlock donated
the prizes.
Henry Barwell and his lady have taken a
Furnished house in Hewitt-avenue, Rose Park,
foi a few weeks. They have been paying a
round of visits since they returned from Eng-
land.
Horace Trenerry’s show of oils and water-
colors at the Argonaut Galleries was launched
by Mrs. Lavington Bonython. The artist struck
an original note by putting cream mounts and
frames on his oil paintings.
Mrs. Hedley Todd entertained about 30
guests at afternoon tea at the Wentworth,
prior to leaving for Sydney on a visit. Iceland
poppies and sweet-peas decked the tables.
The Speck whiles away its winter:
“Old Hobartians” frolicked in fancy dis-
guises at the City Hall. A parade was held
and first prize went to Ethel Bowden's “Nursery
Rhymes” party. Supper was served on the
stage.
The South Hobart A.W.N.L. celebrated its
fourth birthday in the evening at the League’s
rooms, which were gay with early bulbs and
greenery. Little tables were set about, and the
platform at the end of the room made a stage
for two one-act plays, read under the direction
of Mrs - Howard Buchanan. Branch president
Mrs. Amy Lewis, who is holidaying on the
mainland, sent a wire of greeting and congratu-
lations, and Mrs. Raymond Barker received the
guests and did the honors. Mrs. Mary Parker
president of the Tas. A.W.N.L. cut the cake
at supper time.

©“Synchro-Mesh, the easy gear change,
is a great boon and absolutely fool-
proof,” writes a married man. “My
wife and I have just completed a 2,000
miles tour, and on steep gradients, hills
and corners, we found the ease of
changing gear most useful and delight-
ful. To change gear suddenly used to
be a nightmare to my wife, now she
delights to take the car anywhere at
any time; Synchro-Mesh, the easy
gear change, has banished all terrors
for her.”
The magic Synchro-Mesh gearbox is a joy
to lady drivers, because it makes gear changing
so absolutely simple. Just a movement of the
lever, no pausing in neutral or double de-
clutching. Never was there a more reliable
iron hand in a smoother velvet glove!

Subsequently, he settled in the Mana-

“Picker-up”: A Lancashire weaver has
patented what promises to be a notable
advance in cotton manufacture. Cotton
has naturally a beautiful lustre, but the
spinning process crushes this out. The
weaver devised a way of making the
thread without spinning, but though it
retained the lustre, it broke in weaving.
He then coated it with a rubber solu-
tion. This solved the spinning problem,
with the result that when the rubber
is removed the woven cloth retains the
lustre. The mills are now getting in
special machinery for the process.

that has not got into the cables. On one
occasion when Australia’s then Pri-

country’s hotels a high compliment on
their service ; and a faithful chronicler
recorded it. “Service be biowed!” snorted
a Queensland publican ; “the fellow never
had such service as he got in my house.
Why, the night he arrived he put his
spats outside his door and, believe it or
not, we had them soled and heeled and
ready for him to put on the next morn-
ing when he got out of bed.”

“Green Tape”: Reference to curious

as a standard sample—that of Nicholas
Gimcrack, a famous Yorkshire antiquary
and naturalist of the eighteenth century.
John made a careful will, but when he
died it was found that he was an annui-
tant, and that the property left to his
wife and descendants consisted solely of
birds’ eggs and botanical specimens. The
will closed with a bequest typical of all
the others. To his favorite daughter was
left three crocodile eggs, and if she
married with her mother’s consent she
was also to inherit the nest of a hum-

“Black Elliott”: I am afraid “Heres-
one’s” ingenious attempt to prove that
Scotland was settled by Celts from Ire-
land-known as Scotia from the sixth to
the thirteenth century —doesn’t carry him
very far (B. 5/7/’33). Lowland Scotland
—that is, from the Forth of Clyde to the
present Border—was part of the Anglo-
Saxon kingdom of Northumbria from
the eighth century, to go no further back,
The Celts never established themselves
there. True, there was a Celtic infiltration
to Galloway -from beyond St. George’s
Channel but it was soon absorbed by the
Anglo-Saxon type which exists in the
“Stewartry” to-day. Similarly, the Nor-
man immigration from England was
speedily merged with the Anglo-Saxon
element, just as had happened in Eng-
land, Lowland Scotland retaining the
Anglo-Saxon fibre as opposed to that dis-
tinguishing the Celts of the Highlands
and elsewhere.

“C. 8.”: Having recently paid a fly-
ing visit to Port Moresby, I feel in duty
bound to draw the attention of Ernest
C. Rolls to the almost unlimited possi-
bilities of the Papuan ballet. The
Hanuabada ballet has the merit of being
probably a few thousand years older
than the Parisian model Mr. Rolls sets
before him, and it still keeps in touch
with its original ritual significance, as a
means of whetting the savage appetite
for human flesh or stimulating the head-
hunting proclivities of a native audience.
For the rest, the Papuan costume-designer
is in no particular inferior to Mr. Rolls,
and some of his masks and headdresses
are amazing confections. The music only
requires a little decoration, and the
dancers more discipline. Whether the
Papuan Administration would allow Mr.
Rolls to import a corps de ballet from
Port Moresby is doubtful, but a trip
north would be a source of inspiration
to Australia’s leading dealer in theatrical
novelties. The highlight of “Tout Paris”
is the “Rumba,” an extraordinarily
arresting performance by a remarkable
terpsichorean, Patricia Nelson, and the
Rumba is Central African sister to one
variety of Papuan dance.


The Ring’s Birthday.
BY STEELE RUDD.
CCT* HAT’S all there’s to do to-day,”
Dad said when the morning’s
work was about through. “I’m
going to take it easy till evenin’.
The rest of y’ can do what y’ like when
you’ve done what you’re doing.”
“Well, I’ve on’y to cut th’ cows in th’
b-b-bottom paddick, an’ pen-up S-s-silky’s
calf,” Joe stuttered gleefully, “an’ then
I’m d-d-done, too.”
“But I’ve to scald the cans and do
all th’ dairy out before I’m finished,”
Sarah protested; “and I don’t see why I
should do it all by myself.”
“Not on th’ King’s Birthday, gal,” Dad
agreed. Then he called to Dave, who
was shuffling off to his quarters (Dave
had a habit of shuffling off somewhere
whenever the cleaning up was being dis-
cussed): “Here, give her a hand in th’
dairy before you go. It won’t take th’
two of y’ more’n a minute or two.”
“Cripes!” Dave grumbled, “more’n a
minute or two? More’n a hour or two!
An’ I was wantin’ to get away to th’
township.”
“That won’t stop y’ from gettin’ to th’
township. Th’ township won’t run away
from y’,” said Dad.
“An’ to h-h-help in th’ d-d-dairy,” Joe
grinned, “will be a h-h-honor inferred on
y’ on K-k-king’s Birthday, D-d-dave.”
“He’ll be made a M.A.,” Dad added, in
appreciation of Joe’s humor.
But Dave didn’t see the humor of it.
“Cripes, you needn’t say much,” he re-
torted, turning on his parent. “You
wouldn’t if y’ had heard them talkin’ at
th’ fact’ry yesterday about how you
was goin’ to be made a K.C.N.G.”
“What!” Dad gasped. “Who was
tellin’ that I were to be made a
K.C.N.G.? Maloney?”
Dave looked pleased now.
I didn’t say it were Maloney,’’ he
grinned. “All of ’em were saying it.”
“Oh,” Dad snarled, “was they! An’
wouldn’t I be as good a K.C.N.G. as any
o’ themselves, an’ a lot better?”
Dad advanced aggressively on Dave.
“Cripes, who said you wouldn’t? —I
never! ” Dave stepped back a pace.
“An’ it wouldn’t be them who would
make me a K.C.N.G., would it?” Dad
asked.
“It would be th’ K-k-king, hisself,”
Joe put in learnedly.
“Th’ King, o’ course it would! You
know more’n th’ lot of ’em put together.”
Dad bestowed a look of approval on
Joe, who shook his head proudly.
“But what’s a K.C.N.G.?” Sarah, who
had been listening learnedly, asked.
No one answered.
“What is it, Dad?” she repeated.
“A K.C.N.G.? Well”——Dad paused.
“A knightship, ain’t it?” Dave sug-
gested.
“A n-n-night shift, y’ m-m-mean?”
from Joe.
As night shift meant a “night shirt”
to the members of our family, Sarah
broke into mirth. Joe. with increased
pride in himself, joined in heartily.
“Cripes, listen to them ! ” Dave sneered.
“They don’t know what they’re laughin’
at, neither of them!”
“Dammit,” Dad rebuked, “don’t y’
know better ’n to be laughin’ at what y’
don’t know anythin’ about on King’s
Birthday? Go an’ do what you got to
do ; then sit down an’ be quiet.”
Then he addressed Dave, as the latter
turned to enter the dairy with Sarah:
“What were you wantin’ to get to th’
township so early for?”
“Oh, I dunno” Dave hesitated.
“You dunno?” curiously from Dad.
“Well, there’s iaces.”
‘Wh-aht, goin’ to races are you?”
“I was thinkin’ to. It’s a good while
since there was races”
“An’ that’s what you come to me for
five shillin’s for this morning? To go
bettin’ an’ squanderin’ on dam’ horses
an’ thieves! Losin’ my money ”
“By cripes!” Dave broke out so loud
that he startled Sarah. “You’re a caution,
you are! You didn’t give me five bob!
Y’ told me I had to wait till I got it!”
“And haven’t I been tellin’ you a hun-
dred times,” Dad stormed on, “that races
is no good to anyone, on’y fellows who
haven’t got money. Haven’t I?”
“Y-y-yes,” Joe bravely put in; “but you
used to g-g-go to races once yours-s-self,
didn’t y’, D-d-dad? You r-r-raced old
Bess at Sh-shingle Hut, didn’t y’? I
mean before she d-d-died, an”
Dad jumped out at Joe.
“Clear to hell out o’ this,” he bellowed
unbuckling his belt, “an’ see to them
cows.”
Joe cleared like a scalded cat.
“Oh, what’s th’ good o’ standin’ here
talkin’?” Dave sneered, finding his voice
again. “Come on, Sarah,” and off he
went with his sister into the dairy.
For a moment Dad stood with shoul-
ders squared, head erect, staring after
them ; then he grunted and strode heavily
into the house.
Inside he threw his hat on the floor
and sat brooding in silence on the sofa.
Mother, coming from the kitchen,
asked him what was the matter.
“It’s nothin’ but ’orses an’ racin’ with
him, an’ spendin’ money!” Dad growled.
“Do you mean Dave?” from Mother.
“O’ course I mean Dave, woman!
You don’t think I mean th’ ducks, or
th’ kangaroo-dog, do y’? Though they
got more sense than ever he have!”
“He shouldn’t spend money on races,”
Mother agreed feelingly. “How much did
you give him, Father?”
“It isn’t how much did l give him,”
Dad grunted evasively; “it’s him goin’
there an’ spendin’ it an’ gettin’ into bad
company” -
“But I’m sure Dave won’t get into bad
company,” Mother said softly. “And he
knows the Anderson boys, and the
Maloneys will be there, too ; and all of
them like to see horses racing. So did
we all one time.”
“When Maloney comes here again to
borrer anythin’ from me,” Dad, shifting
ground, snorted, “I’m goin’ to tell him
what I think.”
“What has he done, Father?”
“He’s been talkin’ about me an’ laugh-
in’ because I might be made a
K.C.N.G.,” Dad answered, rising and
hanging his waistcoat on the door.
“Goodness, a K.C.N.G.!”
“A K.C.M.G., you mean,” Kate said,
coming from the bedroom with yards
of sewing material in her hand. Kate
was the well-informed one of our family.
“That would mean being knighted, and
you would be ‘Sir Murtagh Rudd,’ Dad,
and Mother would be ‘Lady Rudd.’ ”
“Oh, mercy!” Mother threw up her
hands. “Goodness forbid that anything
like that should ever happen!”
Then she and Kate laughed.
“Orright, orright!” Dad objected.
‘‘Laugh if it amooses y’. ’Cause a man’s
got a farm, do y’ think he can’t be a
‘Sir’ as well as them stoopid members o’
Parliament an’ Lord Mayors?”
And off he went to his room, leaving
Mother and Kate to their sewing.
Meanwhile, Dave and Sarah talked
matters over while they cleaned the dairy.
“Oh, I don’t care a fig,” Dave grinned.
“I got a quid of me own to go to the
races with; but if I’d got th’ five bob
from th’ old man it would have done to
enter Charger in th’ Flutter for th’ grass-
fed hacks with.”
“But if Dad found out he’d go off
about it, Dave,” Sarah warned.
“He won’t find out.till it’s over,” Dave
chuckled, “and then it won’t matter.
It’s for a noo saddle, an’ there’s no grass-
fed hack about here can come within
coo-ee of Charger for half a mile.”
“Gr-gr-grass-fed hacks, is it, Dave?”
Joe, re-entering the dairy out of breath,
gasped. “But I s-s-seen you feedin'
Charger on kuk-kuk-com/”
“What if y’ did; that’s nothin’, is it?”
came sulkily from Dave. “An’ you
needn’t put your spoke in about it if
he wins, need y’?”
“N-n-no,” Joe agreed; “but if he g-g-
-gets excited when you’re on him they
m-m-might see for themselves that he’s
been f-f-fed on corn.”
“So might you get excited,” Dave guf-
fawed. Tossing the milkcans aside, he
left hurriedly.
Sarah also laughed, and a row started.
Then Sarah calling “Mother!
Mother!” fled into the house, Joe in
pursuit.
Dad emerged from the bedroom in
his bare feet, and shook the newspaper
as if it were a weapon. “If there’s any
more o’ this dam’ noise,” he yelled
“I’ll”
“W-w-well, it was ’er,” Joe whined.
“It was her, was it? Well, it’ll be you
this time,” and, dropping the paper, Dad
reached for Joe. But Joe ducked, and
darted out of the door.
Dad. scowling at Sarah, lifted the
paper from the floor and retired again.
Kate started turning the handle of the
hand sewing-machine.
“But can you measure me right with
these clothes on?” Sarah, becoming her-
self again, wished to know.
“You can take your skirt off,” from
Mother; “there’s no one but ourselves
here.”
“Well, shut the door then so as that
fellow cant come poking his nose in,”
Sarah, unforgiveness in her heart, stipu-
lated.
She stepped out of her skirt, and
straightening herself up, stood in bared
arms looking proud and pleased.
“Think there’s enough material in it?”
Mother asked of Kate.
Kate thought there would be.
Next moment a slight noise came to
the door, to which Sarah’s back was
turned. It slowly opened, and Joe in
whiskers and moustache made of dough
put his head in and grinned.
Sarah, who had twisted her head
round, saw the intruder.
“Look at him, Mother,” she com-
plained; “he’s standing there at th’ door
—I knew he couldn’t keep out.”
“Oh, don’t notice him. Keep quiet till
we finish with you!” said Mother.
Joe, emboldened, came right inside.
“Dad!” Sarah cried desperately, “come
here to this fellow!”
Joe curled his “moustache” with his
fingers, then took up Sarah’s discarded
skirt to step into it.
“Dad, Dad!” Sarah let out.
In a bound Dad re-entered the room
in his bare feet.
“What’s up with y’ now?” he roared.
Joe dropped the skirt and rushed for
the door again, with Dad after him. The
“whiskers” fell at the door. Dad planted
his bare foot on them, and they clung to
it. He must have thought he had trodden
on a reptile of some kind, for he stopped
suddenly and kicked his foot about and
struck at it with his hand. Some of the
“whiskers” clung to the hand.
The others began to laugh. Then Dad
understood and sat frowning and glaring.
“Tell him to come in here,” he roared
to Sarah. “I want him.” And he un-
buckled his waistbelt determinedly.
“Don’t take any notice. Father,'
Mother pleaded. “The boy has no one
to play with on King’s Birthday, and
hardly knows what to do with himself.”
“He won’t know what to do with him-
self when I finish with him,” Dad snorted.
“Sarah, go an’ tell him.”
“I’m going,” Sarah answered, making
for the door. She had scarcely reached
it when Joe himself burst in again.
“The n-n-new rooster we got from
Cuk-cuk-carey’s,” he stammered, ad-
dressing them all, “has got th f-f-fishin’-
hook with th’ b-b-bait on it that D-d-dad
set to c-c-catch th’ s-s-snake stuck in his
n-n-neck, and is jumpin’ like mad.”
“There now, see what you’ve done! ”
And Mother turned accusingly to Dad.
“And such a fine rooster!”
“Where’s my boots?” broke wildly
from Dad. Kate got them.
Joe bolted out again to the yard, fol-
lowed by Mother and Sarah. There they
found Gabriel, the new rooster, lying
flat in the dust at the barndoor and
uttering pathetic croaks.
Joe gave the line a tug. At the touch
the rooster bounded high, squawking and
beating time with its wings.
“Don’t pull it! Don’t pull it!” Mother
cried, wringing her hands all about Joe.
Joe gave the bird the slack.
Dad arrived at the run, his boots half-
laced.
“Dammit!” he said, taking the line
from Joe. Then, addressing the rooster:
“Why didn’t y’ keep out o’ th’ barn and
leave th’ wheat alone?”
He handled the line as though playing
a fish on it. Dad caught a cod once in
the Condamine, and knew a lot about
fishing—so he reckoned.
“Get behind it, some o’ you,” said
Dad, “an’ catch it, an’ hold it.”
Sarah and Joe surrounded Gabriel,
diving at him with outstretched hands.
Joe clutched a handful of his tail—and
a fine tail he had, too —but, missing her
grip, Sarah collided with Joe and
knocked him off his feet.
“Oh, look what they’ve done! ” Mother
moaned again; “pulled all the feathers
out of it!”
“Dammit,” Dad shouted, “you’re only
a pair o’ fools !”
Then the rooster’s spurs became en-'
tangled in the slack, and when Dad
pulled the line suddenly it fell on its back
kicking and croaking.
“Keep away!” Dad roared to the
others. Then he grabbed Gabriel.
“N-now how will y’ g-g-get th’ hook
out of him?” Joe questioned, as Dad
held the captive in his arms. “Cut th’
1-1-line an’ let him s-s-swaller th’ bait?”
“That would be worse than ever,”
Mother protested. “Can’t you get it out
with your finger, Father?”
“Cut his dam’ head off, an’ eat him,
would be best!” said Dad.
“Ah, no !” Sarah appealed.
“He’s f-f-fat, too!” Joe observed, feel-
ing Gabriel all over; “an’ his croup’s
f-f-full o’ s-s-somethin’ or other.”
“Full o’ my wheat that he’s been
stealin’ out o’ th’ bags! ” said Dad. “But
here; one o’ you open his mouth while
I’m holdin’ him, and see how far down
th’ hook is.”
'7 w-w-will!” And, pushing Sarah
aside, Joe opened the beak.
“I s-s -see it,” he stuttered. “It’s not
f-f-far down; b-b-but it’s s-s -stuck in
him! ”
Kate appeared on the scene.
“Here, Kate,” Dad said, “you’ve done
a bit o’ nursin’; get th’ hook out o’ th’
dam’ thing while its beak’s open.”
Kate with her slim fingers worked at
the hook till she extracted it, bait and all
“Dam’ y’, go now,” was Dad’s bene-
diction, as he tossed the bird to the
ground, “an’ perhaps you’ll leave th’
wheat alone after this.”
Dad had hardly reached the door of
the house when Dave, his horse a lather
of foam, came galloping into the yard.
“W-w-what are y’ cornin’ back so
q-q-quick for, Dave?” from Joe.
“Did Charger win?” from Sarah.
“By cripes didn’t he?” said Dave ex-
citedly as he dismounted; “but they
wouldn’t give me th’ prize.”
“I hope you weren’t racing him,
Dave?” Mother said gravely.
“Cripes, yes,” Dave admitted, patting
Charger proudly, “an’ do y’ know what
happened? Me an’ Paddy Maloney was
leadin’ th’ others all th’ way, an’ turnin’
into th’ straight I was cornin’ up gettin’
ahead of him, an’ he run me inside a
post; but Charger won. Cripes he did!
And old Maloney entered a protes’, an’
they give th’ prize to Paddy—a brand-
noo saddle! An’ that’s what’s brought
me home—to tell th’ Old Man about it!”
“I wouldn’t say a word to your
father,” Mother advised. “Let them keep
their saddle, and don’t go near their
races again.”
“Y’ w-w-won, an’ they wouldn’t
g-g-give it to y’!” Joe patted the puffing
horse sympathetically.
“But it’s not fair, Mother,” Sarah
reasoned. “If Dave won he should have
got th’ prize, and not Paddy Maloney.”
Dad, with his boots laced, came out
again to see about the milking.
“Oh!” he said, seeing Dave anu
Charger; “back again—after spendin’
your money, and got no more left, I
suppose?”
But Dave was full of courage now.
“Cripes, did I?” he grinned. “I won
a noo saddle—that was th’ sort o’
spendin’ I did.”
“Charger w-w-won th’ gr-gr-grass-fed
hacks, Dad.” Joe put in.
“Wh-aht?” Dad’s manner changed
quickly. “Won a noo saddle, did y’?”
“Cripes I did!” Dave kicked up dust
with the toe of his boot. “He was too
fast for all of ’em, but”——
“Well done; good lad,” Dad enthused
before allowing Dave to finish. “And
did y’ bring th’ noo saddle home with
y’?” Dad looked about in search of it.
The others looked feelingly at Dave.
Dave cleared his throat and explained.
“Oh, that’s it, is it? Well, it were
won on a foul an’ th’ prize can’t be
give to Maloney. It’ll be yours.”
Dave looked surprised.
“But it were never a noo saddle,”
Dad went on. “Did y’ see it?”
Dave shook his head.
“They didn’t see it, neither,” Dad said.
“I gave that prize. It’s there in th’ barn.”
“Cripes, what?” Dave’s jaw fell.
“That old one o’ yours?”
“What’s wrong with it? When it’s
done me for twenty year it ought to be
good enough, oughtn’t it?” And Dad
walked off.
Dave turned to Joe. " Cripes, he’s an
old goat!” Dave said.
And Life Goes On.
I did not know how much of you
1 found in stars,
In hills and rain;
I did not know your slender hands
From my clear skies
Could take the blue.
Pure almond-white against the sea,
The gulls still swing,
The shells are there;
Sandpipers run along the sand
Like little balls.
And still for me
Far gulls stand motionless upon
The wet grey sand,
Like spilt white beads.
I did not know how much of you.
I found in these
Till you had gone.
1 did not know the fragrance spilled
Upon the earth
I revelled in
Was but your presence undefined —-
Your self indeed,
By love distilled.
I know you will not come again,
And life goes on;
The same tides bring
The bright wet seaweeds to my feet.
I, only I,
But go in pain,
And not complain—and not complain.

The Pagan.
BY J. A. HETHERINGTON.
IT had rained without ceasing for two
nights and two days. Steady, drench-
ing, vengeful rain. It drummed on
the iron roof like the beating of a thou-
sand finger-tips.
Like a devil’s tattoo, Alexander Mc-
Kenzie thought, as he stood at the win-
dow. Night would fall soon, he sup-
posed ; it was hard to tell with this rain.
Morning, noon, evening looked alike, no
more than grey smudges, with the smoky
horizon of rain shutting you into a world
a dozen feet square.
He heard his wife come in from the
kitchen. She moved heavily, treading
unevenly on her right foot. The limp
was a legacy from a broken ankle years
before. They never talked of it. Alex-
ander McKenzie said it was the will of
God.
There was a ring of glass on metal as
she lifted the chimney off the lamp. A
match scraped, and yellow light sprang
from the wick. The grey dusk outside
suddenly took on a shade of darkness.
McKenzie turned and surveyed his
wife. She had aged in the last two years.
Her face had gone slack, and the tiny
wrinkles had lengthened and deepened
into furrows. Her body had thickened
into fat shapelessness. She had lost the
last remnant of youth.
McKenzie had aged, too. His mouth
had receded, drawing nose and chin
closer together. His grey eyes had faded,
and the wrinkled lids had fallen lower
round them with a kind of weary pro-
tectiveness. Only in his body, lean, spare,
bent slightly from much work, but hard
as seasoned jarrah. youth lived on un-
impaired.
“No sign of the rain lifting, Alec?”
Her voice was drab, colorless.
His face darkened. “It’s the will of
God.” The smoulder in his eyes leapt
to a savage glow. “Or the Devil.”
He moved forward towards the table,
but he had taken only three steps when
his hands sought a chair-back. He stood
there, breathing heavily, lips pressed
tight.
His wife moved round the table. “What
is it? The pain again?” Terror, thinly
veiled, colored her voice.
McKenzie waved her aside. “Nothing.
It’s nothing. Leave me alone. It’ll pass.”
He stood for a moment longer, grip-
ping the chair-back till his knuckle-bones
showed white in the light of the lamp.
At last he relaxed his grip and slumped
into a chair. .
She moved towards him. ‘Alec,
you’re ill. You should see a doctor ....
He cut her short. “I need no
doctor but the Almighty. It’ll pass, I
tell you. Doctor! What would we pay
him with, and the crop rotting in the
ground?” He laughed jerkily. “Anyway,
1 couldn’t reach him. The river’s oyer
its banks, and every bridge for fifty miles
is gone. Let be! No man could cross
the river to-night.”
“There’s the mountain road.”
He gripped his side. “Thirty-nine mile,
an’ this pain tearing me apart. If there
was a motor I. might go, but it d take all
night in the buggy.”
She sat down in a chair on the other
side of the table and picked up a black
woollen sock. Automatically her fingers
threaded wool into a needle. She watched
her husband secretly. He had drawn the
great family Bible towards him, and his
hands, with black hair gleaming on the
knuckles, were resting on its open pages.
He was not reading. His eyes stared un-
seeingly at his hands. His mouth was
clamped tight.
He was looking on the ruin of his life.
It was subtle torture, after twenty years
of back-breaking labor, twenty years of
effort and stubborn purpose, to see his
simple plan of life crumble and fall apart.
Last year, the blight; now, the rain.
They had said prices might rise. It would
have pulled them out of the quicksand.
But now the rain, a month before the
crop, meant the end of things—of all
things. .
McKenzie’s hands closed convulsively.
Bryant had brought this on them;
Bryant, the pagan, the godless one. Mc-
Kenzie could see no other explanation.
Since Bryant had come, just two years
ago, the luck had changed, the Almighty
had withdrawn his favor.
McKenzie lifted his head. “The Book
says the innocent suffer with the guilty.
His wife did not reply. The years had
accustomed her to her husband’s habit
of quotation. .
“It shouldn’t be,” McKenzie said. His
eyes were staring at her, but they did
not see her. “It shouldn’t be, I say.
The pagans must be punished, but why
should the true servants suffer, too?”
“Now, now, Alec,” his wife said gently.
Her needle flashed in the lamplight.
That was it. Bryant, the pagan. This
was God’s punishment on Bryant. Yet
it fell on him, too, on him, Alexander
McKenzie. Last year, the blight; this
year, the rain. What was it Bryant had
said?..-.. “You can have your religion.
Give me my two hands. You can’t grow
spuds on religion. To hell!” He had
said it with a laugh. He always laughed,
confident, reckless, in his youth. To
hell! Profaning the very altars Alex-
ander McKenzie revered.
The rain beat on the roof like a fusil-
lade of soft bullets. McKenzie could
imagine it sinking into the brown earth,
wrapping insidious fingers round the
roots of his being, destroying him.
Again, the pain bit at his side like the
jab of a steel knife. He clutched with
his hand at his body. Sweat broke out
round his mouth. It would pass, he told
himself grimly. The sharpness of it
went, leaving a dull ache.
“It shouldn’t be,” McKenzie said.
Abruptly his voice rang out with furious
strength. “It shan’t be.”
He came to his feet and stood, sway-
ing slightly. His wife stared up at him,
fearful for what he might do. Her
hands, holding the sock and the needle,
were stilled. His long body had a sini-
ster appearance in the yellow light with
the dark shadows behind.
“Alec! ”
He seemed not to hear. He bent for-
ward and closed the Bible reverently.
Without a word, he turned from the
table and walked to the corner. His
step was a little uncertain ; he breathed
between his teeth, with a whistling sound,
like a man who fights pain. From its
place in the corner, he took the shotgun.
He broke it, and, turning, pointed the
barrel towards the lamp and looked
through it. After a few seconds, he
snapped the breech shut and came to
the table.
A white flame had replaced the smoul-
dering fire in his eyes. A mad, fanatical
flame. He propped the gun against the
edge of the table and said, “It shan’t be.”
She sat motionless while he went into
the bedroom. She heard him moving in
the darkness, the sound of a drawer
opening. He reappeared, clutching some-
thing in his hand. All except one cart-
ridge he dropped into his trousers pocket.
He slipped the remaining one into the
breech of the gun.
His wife caught his arm.
“Alec! ”
He shook her off.
“It’s the will of God.” He gabbled the
words wildly.
Again she caught at him. He swung
away, and her hand brushed the cold
barrel of the gun. She clung desperately,
terror touching her heart.
“Let go,” he said. There was no anger
in his voice, only command. “Let go.”
Still she clung. He took one hand
from the stock of the gun, and the long,
hard fingers closed round her two wrists.
With a jerk, he broke her hold and put
her aside. She stood back against the
table, hands gripped in front of her
breast.
He went to the door and threw it open.
It let in the steady, dead sound of the
rain. He stood looking back at her. His
face was white, and she could see from
the bending of his body that he was suf-
fering intense pain.
“You can’t stop me. No one can stop
me,” he gabbled.
He swayed forward, clutching at his
side. A groan burst from his lips. The
gun, suddenly released, clattered at his
feet and lay with the barrel protruding
into the rain beyond the doorway.
He crumpled forward on his face. His
breath came stertorously.
It was years since Janet McKenzie
had made a decision for herself. She
had, as long as she could remember,
allowed her husband’s personality to
submerge her own.
Now she moved to where he lay ana
sank on her knees beside him. Her hands
passed over his face, felt the stiff stubble
of beard. Something like hysteria gripped
her. Life without Alec was unthinkable.
Slowly an idea formed in her clouded
mind. There was no one but Bryant;
he would help her. He was a pagan,
Alec said. That might be. There was no
other help within seven miles.
McKenzie’s body, for all its spareness,
was heavy. It was two or three minutes
before his wife, half-lifting, half-dragging
as well as she was able, could move him
across the room and lift him on the
old hair sofa by the open fireplace.
At last his eyes opened. The mad flame
was gone from them now. Only the
shadow of intense suffering was there.

“I was going out,” he said slowly,
dully. “What was I going out f0r?....
Oh, it hurts!”
She soothed him, her hand on his fore-
head.
“Lie easy, Alec. You’ll be all right
when the doctor comes.” She tried to
speak brightly. “I’m sending someone
for him now.”
“Someone! Who?” He jerked out the
words. “Not Bryant? Not him?”
“No.” The lie came with surprising
facility. “I’ll harness the horse in the
buggy and drive to the Jenkinses’.”
“Seven mile,” he said. “All right. I
don’t want a quack, but if it’ll make you
any easier I don’t mind.”
He looked away. He could not meet
her eyes. He knew that, by the time
they had gone round the mountain road
and brought the doctor back, it would
be to-morrow night. He couldn’t last it
out.
Janet McKenzie did not stop to har-
ness the horse in the buggy. The
shortest way to Bryant’s place was across
the paddocks.
She pressed forward into the rain. Her
feet sank to the ankles in mud. Each
step was a conscious physical effort. She
could hear the sucking noise her feet
made as they left the mud. Her ankles
were heavy with wet ooze.
She stopped for breath and looked
round her. No light broke the darkness.
There was nothing but the soft music
of the rain. She had no fear. She knew
the way perfectly. She fought her way
on. Mud clutched at her like animate
fingers, rain filled, blinded her eyes.
The dividing fence halted her with a
jerk. She had not realised it was so near.
The sound of her impact with the tight
wire strands went thrumming away into
silence. She stood for a moment pant-
ing, gripping the wet wire with her hands.
Her right leg, the one that had been
broken years ago, throbbed with hot
blood.
She stepped through the fence on to
Bryant’s place.
The going was easier now. Or perhaps
she only imagined it was easier. Bryant’s
hut would be dry ; a fire would crackle
like a friendly voice in the open fire-
place. A lamp would burn there.
The light.... There it was, dim as
the last flicker of a candle. She had
borne too far to the left. A few more
yards and she might have missed it, gone
walking on into the wet darkness. It
sprang to meet her. Her hands felt the
rough-hewn planks of the door. They
reminded her of rough tweed.
The door came open and Bryant stood
there. His face was half in light, half
in shadow. The line of his jaw was
straight as a blade, and his skin was
brown from the open air. His wide neck
reminded her of a column hewn from
dull oak.
It was a long time before he said any-
thing. By then she was sitting at the
log fire, sipping hot whisky and water
from a thick, chipped glass. She looked
at her'feet and laughed. They were comi-
cal in their sheaths of brown mud. She
must have been talking, because Brvant
said:
“It must be appendicitis. We‘ll have
to get the quack. Fast, too. I’ll take
you back in the buggy. Then I’ll go.”
“If you go by the mountain road you’ll
be back by nightfall to-morrow,” she
said.
“No time.” His voice was brisk. “I’ll
go across the river. We’ll come back by
road in the doctor’s car. We’ll be here
by morning, p’raps earlier.”
“Alec says no man could cross the
river in this flood.”
Bryant’s shoulders moved aggressively.
To hell! he said. Then : “I’ll get the
buggy harnessed.”
McKenzie woke to a consciousness
that buzzed like the inside of a machine
shop. He was aware of voices in the
room ; low voices. He did not want to
listen. He wanted to shut them out.
plug his ears against them. Each mut-
tered word was a hammer-stroke on his
brain. Someone soothed him. He slept
When he woke again the roaring was
gone from his brain. He tried to move,
but sharp pain in his side checked the
action before it was properly born. The
door of the bedroom was open, and he
could see out through the window of the
living-room. The rain had stopped, and
sunlight gleamed on the glass panes of
the window.
A woman’s voice said authoritativelv,
“Lie quiet. You’re all right now.”
No, he said. "I’ve got to get up
and see to my spuds.”

cuffs and collar, of the district nursing

He lay silent for a time.
“The crop” he began.
“Never mind,” the nurse said. “The
neighbors will look after it.”
He was aware of a shadow in the door-
way. A man stood there, one hand rest-
ing against the doorpost. It was Bryant.
The nurse said: “Here’s the man
you’ve got to thank for your life. He
swam his horse across the river the night
before last and got the doctor.”

THE GENTLEMAN ON THE COALS.
BY KATHARINE SUSANNAH PRICHARD.
PADDY had mixed the flour and
water, added a pinch of salt, and
worked the dough with his hands.
He carried his tin dish to the fire and
squatted there to stow his damper in the
camp oven.
Over a tin dish, on a wooden box fixed
to the end of a sapling post, Mick was
washing the red dust of a day’s shovel-
ling dirt and dry blowing from his face
and hands. His tent, at the end of a
row of bough sheds and tents made of
bags sewed together, showed white
against snap-and-rattle, camel bush and
sandalwood along the brow of the ridge
behind him.
Long Bill Morrissey, standing down
there by the fire, gazed into the sunset,
the musical-box in his breast beginning
to wheeze as cooler air, wafted over the
widespread earth, struck through his
grey flannel shirt and the faded blue
dungarees on his legs, the long bowed
legs of a horseman and camel-driver.
They were shy of tucker that day on
Wren’s rush, and, as Paddy raked away
embers of the fire to set the camp oven,
Mick called:
“How about ‘a gentleman on the coals,’
Paddy? And we needn’t wait for the
damper.”
“Right.”
Paddy broke off a lump of dough,
stowed the rest in the camp oven, and
settled the lid over the squat black pot.

handle he lifted a layer of white ash

Mick Wren and his mates were on
gold. They had been prospecting in the
ridges and scrub country round about
the Salt Lakes for three months when
Mick specked a twenty-ounce slug in
likely country about fifty miles out from
Coolgardie. The news flew like wildfire.
Claims were pegged east and west, north
and south of the prospecting area and
mining lease Mick had applied for, with
Bill Morrissey and the Bunny brothers.
“See Joe Hegney’s pegged alongside the
Dook!” Mick said, as Paddy, squatting
on his haunches like a gin, laid a couple
of flat scones on embers.
Taking a tin of tobacco and a folder
of papers from his trousers pocket, Mick
rolled himself a cigarette and lit up.
“Hoofed it from Norseman.” Jack
looked up through the soap and water he
was sluicing his face with. “Not a bean
to bless himself with.
“Scotty says The family turned
him down a couple of years ago. Said
he was a dirty old blackguard. Didn’t
want to have anything more to do with
him —though Joe did the decent thing by
them when he had money. The boy’s
a doctor somewhere East, and the girls
married well.”
Paddy stood up from the fire.
“He’s a hard nut to crack, old Joe,”
he chuckled. - “Made and lost more
money than most of them in the early
days on Coolgardie. Been chasin’ the
weight all his life; and can’t leave off
now... .unless he’s on the booze.”
“Joe Hegney?” Long Bill came out
of his abstracted gazing into the sunset.
“We was mates on a prospecting trip
up Nannine way. Lost our camels.
Nearly done a perish. We got good
gold. But after a bit Joe was fidgety
about the missus and kids in Coolgardie.
We had to come in ; and he was right,
sure enough. One of the youngsters had
died while we was out. After that Joe
started running a poultry farm out of
the town, milking a few cows. Said it
was no good to a man trapesing round
the country with a young family to rear.
There’d be time enough to go after gold
when his family was grown.”
“A great prospector, Joe,” Mick said.
“He’d spot colors where another man’d
walk over them.”
Bill nodded, deep in his reminiscence.
“He was a good mate but the
heaviest hand with damper ever I knew'.
He’d pick a loaf off the coals and toss
it into the scrub to cool. You had to
watch where it fell and run after it, rub
the dust off, and there was your meal
.... if it hadn’t broken to bits.”
Peter Tierney, who had come for
water, put his kerosene buckets down
beside the tank.
“How is she, Peter?” somebody asked.
Peter slumped down on a box beside
Mick.
“I wouldn’t be saying she’s not there,
Mick,” he said. “But I haven’t seen her
yet.”
“You young chaps! ” Paddy went over
to the tin dish to wash the dough off
his hands. “You’re always in such a
hurry.”
“Hurry, is it?” Peter stooped for a
dry twig and stirred up the ashes in his
pipe. “Three months to-day we been
shovelling dirt, me and my mate, and not
seen a color, though they’re getting her
all round us. I hear Joe Hegney’s
come in.”
“Blew along this morning,” Jack volun-
teered. “Near done a perish. Hadn’t the
price of a meal. Pegged down beside the
Dook. Banged holes in-a kerosene-tin
and rigged a shaker with a bit of wire-
netting and sticks he had in his swag.
Been shovel! in’ dirt and shakin’ like
blazes all day.”
“Remember the time his goat got into
the manse in Coolgardie?” Peter asked.
“Rooned the garden and flowers, and set
to makin’ a meal of the hymn-books.
The parson sued Joe for damages.”
“Joe swore it wasn’t his goat,” Paddy
said.
“Everybody knew it was Joe’s goat,”
Peter went on. “The magistrate him-
self knew.
“ ‘Of course, he’s your goat,’ the magis-
trate said. ‘Of my own knowledge I
can say he’s your goat.’
“‘He’s not, y’r Worship!’ Joe stuck
out. ‘He was my goat, but I disowned
him when he turned Protestant.”
They had heard the story before, but
they laughed loyally.
“Soon afterwards he started that chook
farm,” Bill said, stirring the gossip
again.
Peter nodded, eyes aglow over his pipe.
“You ask Dick Flanagan, the publi-
can —he knows all about that. Flana-
gan’s was the smartest house in Cool-
gardie those days. Driving out, Dick
saw Joe’d got some cows and vegetables,
and the fowls were running wild. s
“ ‘Fine cockerels you’ve got there, Joe,
Dick said. ‘What are you selling them
f° r ?’ . .
“ ‘Seven and six to you, Dick. Eight
bob to anybody else.’
“Flanagan wanted to pay for the
birds on the spot. But Joe says: ‘No ;
it’s safer with you than with me, Dick.
I’ll come for the money when I want it.
“After a few months, when the
cockerels had been delivered and eaten,
Joe goes into the pub, strolls up to the
bar where Dick’s busy serving the drinks,
and says:
“ ‘How about payin’ me for those
chickens of mine, Mr. Flanagan?’
“ ‘Right, Joe,’ Dick says. ‘A dozen
pair at seven and six.’
“ ‘Ten shillings a pair, Mr. Flanagan,’
says Joe ; and he wouldn’t take less.
“It went on for months like that.
“Then one day some of the Perth
nobs came up. They stayed at Flana-
gan’s, and Dick showed them the sights
and the mines. He was strolling along in
his best clothes as smart and polite as
you please, yarning to John Forrest,
George Throssell and the rest, when
along comes Joe Hegney and hails him
from the side of the street:
“ ‘Hey, Mr. Flanagan,’ he yells ; ‘how
about payin’ me for those chickens of-
mine you’ve got in your belly? D’ye
think these respectable gentlemen would
like to be walking with ye if they knew
ye’d not paid me for those chickens?’
“And next day, when Joe strolled into
the taproom, Dick was waiting for him.
“ ‘Here,’ he shouted. -‘Take your
money, Joe. A dozen cockerels at ten
bob. You win, Joe.’ ”
“Hey, youse! Who’s takin’ me name
in vain?”
A tall, scraggy figure heaved out of
the gathering dusk. Closer inspection
revealed him to be an old man in dark
trousers and a greasy grey flannel shirt,
heavy with red dust. Grey hair, coarse
as a goat’s, stood on end over his bony
skull. One eye was closed ; the other
darted like a silverfish in the small red
hole of his withered face.
He drew himself up and his legs
straddled gamely. “They tell me you
chaps are gettin’ all the gold on this
rush, and keeping your mouths shut.”
“Go on, Joe, who’s been tellin’ you
that?” Mick asked.
“Well, it’s a lie!” the old man shouted.
“Look at this! ”
He fumbled with a piece of grimy
flannel held in one hand, unwrapping it
with the other. He thrust out his arms,
and there lay a pancake of gold with
red dust on its crisp edges.
“Cripes! ”
“You got her this time, Joe!”
“What do you reck’n she’ll go?”
The men clustered round in their ex-
citement and admiration. The slug
passed from hand to hand, balanced and
weighed.
“Sixty ounces if she’s a ’weight.”
“Sixty-five.”
“Nearer seventy.”
“Tried her against four pounds of
sugar,” Joe said, “and there’s nothing to
choose between ’em.”
“On the first day, the old devil! And
some of us have been here three months
and not seen a color.”
“I was just knocking off for the day,
loosenin’ a bit of odash dirt with me
pick ; and there she was, layin’ in the
‘cat,’ ” Joe explained gleefully.
But Paddy had his weather eye on the
camp-fire, which was giving forth the
balmy fragrant odor of baked bread.
He was hungry and he wasn’t forgetting
his “gentleman on the coals” for a sixty-
ounce slug even. Squatted back on his
hindquarters before the embers, he
flipped half a dozen of the large white
scones on an enamel plate, and trotted
off to the bough shed with them.
Jack dropped a handful of tea into a
billy of boiling water, lifted the billy
from its hook over the fire, and fol-
lowed Paddy.
Mick and Bill strolled after them with
Joe and Peter in tow. Seated on boxes
round a table of bush timber in the shed, .
they settled down to the meal of “tinned
dog” Paddy had served out with “a hot
gentleman from the coals” beside each
plate.
When the mugs were filled with tea
Bill lifted his old hard-doer of white
enamel, chipped and rusty in every crack.
“Here’s to you, Joe,” he said.
“Here’s to us and dryblowin’,” Joe
shouted, his exuberance overflowing with
the tea which slopped on to his shirt.
“And I wish it was beer.”
Paddy stood up, striking an attitude,
pompous and aldermanic, holding his
mug aloft.
“Gentlemen, the dryblower!” he
shouted.
“When he dies to Heaven he flies,”
Mick warbled, and everybody joined in,
singing lustily:
“With dust in his eyes fit to blind him.
What a rattle he’ll make
As he goes through the gate,
Dragging his bloody old shaker behind him.”
Sunset was fading out behind the far
wave of the snap-and-rattle ; a grey dark
sea of slight closely-growing trees to the
horizon; yellow and saffron lying across
a green sky. Speculation veered from
Joe’s slug and what he would get for
it in Coolgardie to prospects of the rush.
Whether .they would peter out, as the
promise of so many an alluvial rush had
done before, or whether the reef from
which the big slugs had floated down
would prove so rich that the low ridge,
along which only a few prospectors’
tents gleamed like shells in the twilight
now, would be torn some day by the
shafts and poppet-heads, the stacks and
dumps of a lively mining township.
