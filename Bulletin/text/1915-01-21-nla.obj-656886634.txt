Other Australian plays have been
produced by amateur organisations not of a
repertory character.
On the general question of the support of
Australian drama, some interesting expres-
sions of opinion may be quoted. Gregan
McMahon incidentally remarks: “I have
grown tired of the Australian Play contro-
versialists here in Melbourne. I see' so
much of them in print and in ink. I shall
be more interested in them when they
materialise on the empty benches at Aus-
tralian performances.”
Perce. A. Cameron, hon. sec. of the
N.S.W. Theatre League, writes: “I regret
our list is not bigger. Our trouble is that
whilst the quantity of Australian work is
unlimited, its quality is very limited. We
are staging work by English dramatists
because—ahd solely because—we do not gets
suitable local product submitted. Our main
avowed object is to produce Australian plays
by Australian playwrights featuring Aus-
tralian players; and we will revert to it as
soon as we can get the plays. My experi-
ence in this and other movements is that they
don’t help themselves. We are prejudiced in
favor of local work: when we read" it, in
most instances, we are prejudiced against
it.”
Wilfrid Neill, of the Adelaide Repertory
Theatre, reports in the same strain: “Not a
single Australian author is represented in our
list of productions this year, which is a fact
for which I take no shame, except that,
being an Australian, I should share in the
obloquy which should be poured upon the
heads of the audiences like hot oil. They
simply will not come to such a play; and
since our very existence depends upon the
public pocket we must give the public what
it wants—to a degree! Again, I have seen
no full evening bill Australian plays, fear
those of Adams and Esson, so you see how
little is written in dramatic form which is
procurable by us.”
The Sydney Repertory Theatre’s experi-
ence is slightly different. “Of the sad fact
of the general hopelessness of the majority
of Australian plays submitted there can be
no palliation. Quite 30 plays have been
submitted during the year, but the majority
were essentially undramatic. The fault
seems to lie in the authors’ lack of even
elementary knowledge of stage technique, and
though the importance of stage technique is,
in commercial circles, enormously over-rated,
the essentia 5 'invariably necessary. As
to the support of the public, our experience
has been that though Australians did not
give house-full audiences to Australian pro-
ductions, at least their support was better
at Australian plays than at the productions
of imported plays. It must be remembered
that the Sydney Repertory Theatre has had
several seasons of six nights for one play.
The policy, in the future, is an energetic
encouragement of the Australian play, in the
belief that the audiences for such produc-
tions are steadily augmenting.”
The British Government is publishing a
100-page pamphlet entitled Great Britain
and the European Crisis, containing corres-
pondence. statements in Parliament, and a
succinct introductory narrative of the events
leading to the present international unhappi-
ness. This authoritative work is published
at the amazing price of Id. It is a useful
statement of the Empire’s position. Other
recent war publications include the Russian
White Book (3d.) and a list of all the Gov-
ernment’s war issues (gratis.)
Poems by Chris. U. Brennan.
After many years of much labor the moun-
tain has brought forth a masterpiece, Poems
—just that—by Chryptic J. Brennan. The
mountain explains the discrepancy between
“105 pieces printed in 1913, but only a dozen
dated later than 1902.” In 1597 appeared
21' Poems Towards the Source. “The poem
‘Liletli,’ approached in 1897, begun in 1898,
served as a focus for the grouping of certain
early pieces and for the generation of
others: so grew the plan of ‘The Book of
J.ileth,’ a plan communicated in full to
friends before the beginning of the century.
Eight pieces of ‘The Wanderer’ appeared
in 1902. Nothing, then, seemed to prevent
the early completion of a book containing
at least 93 of these pieces. There inter-
vened what humanity is accustomed to call,
with equal vagueness in either case, ‘Life,’
or the ‘circumstances’ which it likes to
imagine, as ‘beyond its control’; pendebant
opera interrupt-ay. the fault was the author’s.
Interest came back slowly : much had to be
reduced, torn down, rebuilt, much completed,
much written that had not been as much as
begun—and some was written as late as
last June: the original plan had been carried
out.”
Here is Poetry! Chryptic J. Brennan is
at heart a poet—or was at heart a poet—
for his explanation does not make it clear
whether the Poems are to be dated 1902,
whether, in effect, he has ceased the writing
of poetry and has devoted the years between
to the revising of the original inspiration.
Certainly his best poetry is his earliest.
This critic, reading the huge volume care-
fully through, marked a score or so of poems
that seemed to him poetry, and fine poetry,
and found when he looked up the index that
in practically every case he had selected
pieces dated years ago. There is the heart
of poetry in Chryptic J. Brennan, but it is,
or has been, overlaid by a sheathing of lab-
ored affectation. There are pages and
poems that remain utterly unintelligible to
this critic,
Yet obscurely stirs a monstrous worm
in the rear cavern of his dazzled thought.
That, the poet might say, is the fault of
the capacity of this critic’s mind.
Yet consider: —
Twice now that lucid fiction of the pane
dissolves, the sphere that winter’s crystal bane
still-charm’d to glass the sad metempsychose
and futile ages of the suffering rose—
what, in its halt, the weary mood might show.
Doubtless Chryptic J. Brennan, means
something by this opening, even if merely
the expression of a mood—and in many
isolated poems he has set himself this diffi-
cult problem and triumphantly solved it —
but would not it be better art if it were
more lucidly expressed? He cannot plead
that he could not get his effect by a little
more clarity: we are left with the conviction
that he wilfully prefers his sonorous
obscurity.
Consider again :
0 thou that achest, pulse o’ the unwed vast,
now in the distant centre of my brain
dizzily narrow’d, now beyond the last
calm circle widening.of the starry plain,
where, on the scatter’d edge of my surmise,
the twilit dreams fail off and rule is spent
vainly on vagrant bands the gulfs invite
to break away to the dark: they, backward sent,
though dumb, with dire infection in their eyes,
startle the central seat: O pulse of night,
when the noon-world is fused in fire and blent
with my then unattained hero-mood ;
what will with me the imperious instinct
that hounds the gulfs together on that place
banishing utterly out of mortal trace,
the citadel where I would seem distinct —
if not thou ween’st a vanity, my deep,
unlighted still, the which thy refluent sweep
intolerably dilates, a tide that draws
with lunatic desire, distraught and fond,
to some dark moon of vastness, hung beyond
our little limits of familiar cause,
as though the tense and tortured voids should
dash
ruining amorously together, a dash
portentous with some rose of thinnest flame,
secret, exhaled in the annull’d abyss,
that, with this goul, passes in that fell kiss
and to the soft-sprung flush of all sanctity
surrenders, centring in the blossom’d Name,
as the dark wings of silence lovingly
hover above the adventurous song that fares
forth to the void and finds no lip that shares
its rapture, just the great wings spreading wide.
As a single sentence this is magnificent,
but is it poetry? If it isn’t poetry why
does it find place in Poems? Is there any
reader of this page, including Chryptic J.
Brennan, who understands what the poet
was attempting to express? This page is
seriously worried about this poem, and will
welcome any assistance in deciphering its
meaning. And the same poet wrote thus: —
The spaces of the waters of the dawn
are spiritual with our transfigured gaze;
the intenser heights of morning, far withdrawn,
expect our dream to shine along their ways....
I cannot tell what god is in her gaze,
such depths of slumb’rous passion drown my breath,
but where the charmed shadow clings and stays
Fate cowers before that high disdain of death....
And sudden, ’twixt a sun and sun,
the veil of dreaming is withdrawn:
10, our disrupt dominion
and mountains solemn in the dawn....
Behind the veil of burning silence bound
vast Life’s innumerous busy littleness
is hush’d in vague-conjectured blur of sound
that dulls the brain with slumb’rous weight,
some dazzling puncture let the stridence throng
in the cicada’s torture-point of song....
The trees, that through the tuneful morn had
made
bride-dusk for beams that pierce the melting shade,
or through the opulent afternoon had stood
lordly, absorb’d in hieratic m00d....
If any murmur that my ’sdainful hand
withholds its sacrifice
where ranged unto the Law the peoples stand,
let this blown word sufliee:
The gift of seif is self’s most sacred right:
only where none hath trod,
only upon my secert starry height
I abdicate to God.
Yes, there is enough of the purest poetry
in this work permanently to set Chryptic J.
Brennan on the ambitious pedestal he
reared for himself so long ago. The reader
will be well content, will be, indeed, grateful
if he is allowed to dig out the poetry and
let the affectations go. Poems is more than
a considerable contribution to the literature
of this continent, to be the more cherished
since it seems likely to be Chryptic J.
Brennan’s last.
We sat entwined an hour or two together
(how long l know not) underneatli pine-
trees
that rustled ever in the soft spring weather
stirr’d by the sole suggestion of the breeze:
we sat and dreamt that strange hour out to-
gether *
fill’d with the sundering silence of the seas:
the trees moan’d for us in the tender
weather
we found no word to speak beneath those
trees
but listen’d wondering to their dreamy
dirges
sunder’d even then in voiceless misery;
heard in their boughs the murmur of the
surges
saw the far sky as curv’d above the sea.
That noon seem’d some forgotten afternoon,
cast out of Life, ivhere Time might scarcely
be:
our old love was but remember’d as some
swoon;
Sweet, I scarce thought of you nor you of
me
but, lost in the vast, we watched the minutes
hasting
into the deep that sunders friend from
friend;
spake not nor stirr’d but heard the murmurs
wasting
into the silent distance without end:
so, whelm’d in that silence, seem’d to us as
one
our hearts and- all their desolate reverie,
the irresistible melancholy of the sun,
the irresistible sadness of the sea.
Gf old, on her terrace at evening
—not here-—in some long-gone kingdom
oh. folded close to her breast!
Our gaze dicelt wide on the blackness
(was it trees? or a shadowy passion
the pain of an old-world longing
that it sobb’d, that it swell’d, that it
shrank?)
—the gloom of the forest
blurr’d soft on the skirt of the night-skies
that shut in our lonely world.
Not here —in some long-gone w0r1d. ...
Glose-lock’d in that passionate arm-clasp
no word did we utter, we stirr’d not:
the silence of Death, or of Love.
Only, round and over us, f
that tearless infinite yearning,
and the Night with her spread wings rust-
ling,
folding us with the stars.
Not here —in some long gone Kingdom
of old. on her terrace at evening,
oh, folded close to her heart!
I sorrow for youth — ah, not for its wildness
(would that were dead!)
but for those soft nests of time that enticed
the maiden bloom
of delight and tenderness to break in delicate
air
—O her eyes in the rosy face that bent
over our first babe!
but all that was, and is gone, and shall be
all forgotten;
it fades and wanes even note: and who is
there cares but I?
and I grieve for my heart that is old and
cannot cease from regret.
Ay, might our harms be liaven’d in some
deathless heart:
but ivhere have I felt its over-brooding
luminous tent
save in those eyes of delight (and ah! that
they, must change)
and of yore in her eyes to whom we ran
with our childish joy?
0 brother! if such there were and each of
us might lead each
to lean above the little pools where all our
heart
lies spilt and clear and shining along the
dusky way,
and dream of one that could save it all and
salve our ache!
The land I came thro’ last was dumb with
might,
a limbo of defeated glory, a ghost:
for wreck of constellations flicker’d perishing
scarce sustain’d in the ‘mortuary air,
and on the ground and out of livid pools
wreck of old swords and crowns glimmer’d
at whiles;
I seem’d at home in some old dream of
kingship:
now it is clear grey day and the road is
plain,
I am a wanderer of many years
who cannot tell if ever he was king
or if ever kingdoms were: T know I am
the wanderer of the wavs of all the worlds,
to whom the sunshine and the rain are one
and one to stay or hasten, because he knows
no ending of the way, no home, no goal,
and phantom night and the grey day alike
withhold the heart where all my dreams and
days
might faint in soft fire and delicious death:
and saying this to myself as a simple thing
I feel a peace fall in the heart of the, winds
and a clear dusk settle, somewhere, far in
me.
I said, This misery must end:
Shall I, that am a man and know
that sky and wind are yet my friend,
sit huddled under any blow?
so speaking Lett the dismal room
and stept into the mother-night
all fill’d with sacred quickening ,gloom
where the few stars burn’d low and bright,
and darkling on my darkling hill
heard thro ’ the beaches sullen boom
heroic note of living will
rung trumpet-clear against the fight;
so stood and heard, and rais’d my eyes
erect, that they might drink of space,
and took the night upon my face,
till time and trouble fell away
and all my soul sprang up to feel
as one among the stars that reel
in rime on their rejoicing way,
breaking the elder dark, nor stay
but speed beyond each trammelling gyro,
till time and sorrow fall away
and night be withered up, and fire
consume the sickness of desire.
“S.T.S.”: Looking through the prize
sonnets of a whole Australian year, one is
struck by the curious dread of Winter.
Either this is an inheritance from British
writers, or Winter in our happy, but, on the
whole, unpoetical, south of the continent, is
a different thing from that experienced on
the east coast, where bards are more fre-
quent and more fluent. April is spoiled for
Herbert Tracey by a thought of “the dingo
Winter creeping nigh.” Nina Murdoch has
heard May lamenting, “Alas ! the winter is
already here!” And the same-lady cele-
brates in August the fact that winter has
been “robbed of its sting.” Now, down Adel-
aide way we reckon things in exactly re-
verse style. April, pleasant in itself, is
doubly welcome as heralding seven months
at least of (pretty nearly) the finest weather
the world has to show. Beautiful October,
on the other hand, reminds one that drying-
up time is coming; not having the skill to
express it in verse,' we must borrow and
adapt Tracey’s phrase, and call it “the dingo
Summer creeping nigh.” Elliott Napier is
the poet for our money, with liis “scorpion
Summer.” As for winter, there is none in
these parts; none, at least, of which to feel
the faintest dread. No doubt, when the
Northern Territory becomes .more articulate,
the Wet Season and the alligator and other
local phenomena will be celebrated in verse.
Evidently no one poet—or even batch of
poets— can sing adequately for a whole
continent.
Rosnagh B. Massereene: As a reader who has fol-
lowed the “Month” Sonnet Competition with much
interest, I should like to suggest that upon its
conclusion you announce which was; considered by
the judge the finest sonnet the cycle produced. [No
hope!] Personally I place top the June sonnets of
Helen Power and Lilia Gormhuile McKay, anj the
October of Gladys Kernot. Of course, given correct-
ness of form, preference remains very much a matter
of individual fancy. For instance, I cannot understand
anyone’s preferring Nina Murdoch’s August sonnet to
that of Elliott Napier. His struck me as a fine
thing—the other —well, apart from the Tennysonian
echo, there was Gladys Kernot’s October idea and
Lilia Gormhuile McKay’s July form. (I lately came
across a little poem by Nina Murdoch—the best of
the new war-poems I have seen—entitled simply
“Socks.” It had heart-throbs in it.) By the way,
it came as something of a shock to us Maorilanders
to find that .The Bulletin, which we thought made a
point of counting Australia and Maoriland as one,
should have disqualified the best of the July sonnets
for its Maoriland atmosphere.
[A sonnet of Australia was a&ked for, Maori-
landers were not disqualified from supplying one. _ A
M.L. sonnet was not asked for, because the intrusion
of a sonnet dealing with M.L. flora and fauna and
weather would have spoiled the continuity of the
series. Some day, maybe, a sonnet series of the
M.L. months will be required. In that case Aus-
tralians will not be debarred, provided they picture
M.L. conditions. —R.P.]
“Montales”: “M. 11.” (B, 3/12/T4) de-
fends the “dawn-morn” rhyme on the ground
that “awn” and “orn” are “two different
shots at the same sound.” The sounds are
not identical, and the confusion of the one
with the other is a rank Cockneyism that has
unfortunately made its way far into general
English. “If the ear is not offended,” writes
“M. 11.” Precisely; but, if “M.H.” takes
“hawn” as an equivalent of “horn.” and
“dorn” as adequately representing “dawn,”
he would probably perceive no orthoepic dis-
tinction between “father” and “farther,” and
is consequently out of court as far as “ear”
is concerned.
Mary Gaunt, author of Alone in Wes#
Africa, has no such interesting adventures as
befell her in that book to tell in A Woman
in China (Laurie). Mary Gaunt went to
China by the Siberian railway, saw as much
of China as it is given to a white woman
to see, discourses pleasantly upon her experi-
ences, makes some acute observations upon
the Chinese, and provides a well-illustrated
volume for the discursive reader.

PERFORATED
RAZOR HONE.
Y The secret of Easy Shaving is proper Honing.
The PERFORATED RAZOR HONE puts into
the hands of every man the secret of Automati-
cally producing that perfect, Smooth-cutting
Edge which makes shaving a pleasure -
The regular row of holes in the Perforated Razor
Hone have an undercut effect, shearing the wire edge
smoothly off.
Why the Perforated Hone
is so Easy to Use.
As the razor-edge gets thin and sharp, a Wire-edge commences to form, but as the
razor is drawn slantingly forward across the regular rows of holes, their deftly-
rounded edges have a sort of undercut effect, shearing the Wire-edge smoothly
off as fast as it forms, and dropping it as fine steel dust into the holes.
Give six strokes or a hundred—-you simply can’t hurt your razor if you keep it
fiat on the hone, which is a specially hard but very fine stone; it leaves a
smooth, keen cutting edge that is a revelation even to a barber. Perforated Razor
Hones will last a lifetime.

Dear Sirs, —I am pleased to bear testimony to the merits ot your “Bonning-
ton’s Irish Moss,” which, personally, I have proved to be a valuable and safe
remedy for all bronchial and throat affections.
I have never failed to recommend it to my patients and friends, in coughs

Every Woman Can Have
A PERFECT
BUST
It matters not if you have been thin and scraggly for years, even if you
never were properly developed your measurements can be increased to normal
and your figure nicely rounded out to pleasing, plump proportions. It is
lone every day for others —why not you?
Mrs. B. Driesden wrote from Armidale, 25th May, 1913: —
“I do not require any more of Dr. Falliere’s Flesh-Food,
as I am developed as much as I desire. My measurements
have increased satisfactorily, and my health has improved
wonderfully. 1 will tell my friends of your treatment, and
will always recommend it, and I wish to thank you for your
kindness and prompt attention to my wants.”

“It gives me great pleasure to inform you that I
have been completely cured of the Tobacco Habit by
your wonderful Tobacco Specific, after using tobacco
heavily for seven years, sometimes Boz. to lOoz. in
the week. It is now 12 months since I last used
tobacco, and, although I am continually in the com-
pany of smokers, I do not have the least desire to
smoke, therefore I consider the cure permanent.
“My general health is now perfect; all my former
complaints, such as irregular Heart Action, Dizzi-
ness, Nervousness and Stomach Trouble, which I
have every reason to believe were caused through the
use of tobacco, have entirely disappeared, and are
onlv remembered as a hideous nightmare. I eat
and sleep well, and feel fit to face the world again.
It will give me great pleasure to recommend your
remedy to others.”

[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
The Ne’er-do-well.
Beside the road to Berrima
He stayed me with a greeting smile;
And, by my troth, I was not loth
To rest and smoke with him awhile.
In truth he seemed a robust rogue,
Too old to mar, or mend, or make —
A tough-grained tree which Destiny
Had bent and bruised, but could not break.
’Twixt puffs he spake: “There’s makes and
makes
Of men. and men of many kinds —
There’s he that sleeps and he that reaps,
And he that seeks and never finds.
“There’s he that struggles for the best
And he who staggers ’neath the worst,
And he who flies to zenith skies
To fall derided and accurst.
“There’s he who drains the bitter cup,
With mouth awry and eyes that shine,
With stinging tears, who in the year
May find it medicine divine.
“There’s he that cries, ‘alack, alack!’
And shouts for stars beyond his reach;
And there are some whose lips are dumb
For that their anguish passes speech.’’
The smoke rings circled round his head
And vanished in the quiet air;
“And there are those who, win or lose,
Alike exult not, nor despair.
“ ’Tis this or that that fever-heats
Our blood and spoils our hours of ease,
With some ’tis wealth, with some ’tis health,
And other some have memories.
“Aye, memories! In silent hours
The old grief comes, the old regret..
What right has she to trouble me
Who loved and lost and would forget!
“Out, out on memory, I say.
Let all dead things that buried be!
Let who will sigh for days gone by,
For me the world wags joyously.”
All this was when I paused to talk,
What time the long tree-shadows fell.
To one whose earth was gay with mirth.
A bronzed, grey-headed ne’er-do-well.

RODERIC QUINN.
Rot.
I’ve patiently listened at small debates to
Rot in its varied guise—
Absorbingly startling new ideas of folk who
are almost, wise;
Beautiful thoughts of the female brain,
subtle and soulful guff,
And numerous fads that hide defects with
very artistic stuff.
The zeit-geist crank, and the seance crook,
and the Christian-science bore,
The spiritist, and the altruist, and the
student of occult lore,
Have each of them gripped my buttonhole,
explaining the thing to me
With awfully cogent arguments that anyone
ought to see.
And I’ve been a bit of a crank myself, in a
modest and tinpot way—•
One cannot avoid the kinks of thought that
ever will have their day—
But I’ve lost my faith in the superman, and
the ultimate human al,
And the doubtful dealings of Providence,
and the doubtful talk of a soul.
I’ve lost belief in a deal of rot that busied
us while it stayed,
Until we found it was really dead, and alto-
gether decayed;
Though when we buried it out of hand, being
just what we are,
We looked about for some newer brand to
hail as a guiding star.
Great is science, and grand is art, and noble
the clean, clear brain,
When each is free from the turgid stuffs
that cumber the truths writ plain;
Aloof from heavens austerely cold and hells
that are flaming hot,
And scorning the fungus fads that swell the
ruinous ranks of Rot.
VICTORIA.
C.G.A. COLLES.
Aloof.
I live un somewhere near the sky,
And when at daybreak I awake,
From one small window I can spy
In colors bright the morning heat,
Yet, when elate, my poetry seems
To find its feet —its rhythmic legs,
A smell is wafted from below
Which makes me think of ham and eggs.
And I can watch at night the stars
Splashed on the heaven’s purple tent,
Until my soul through ether swims
On wings of soulful sentiment;
But something through my nostril brings
A fancy most compelling that
The stars have strong resemblance to
The gleaming sprays of sausage fat.
The house-smells all to me arise,
Like plenty’s spectres, up the stairs,
And in my best poetic thoughts
The low brutes take me unawares;
They wake m,v drowsy memory,
And say: “It was on such a night
The balcony had Irish stew,
And later on got very tight!”
Up here I have the wide, wide heavens;
The stars that in the evening glow;
Yet I would pawn them, if I could,
For tripe and onions down below.
It is not lack of sentiment.
Though stars and dawns are very well,
I’d sooner live three storeys down
Than dine on poetry and smell!

THEY WHO DIVIDED THE SKIN
BEFORE THE BEAR WAS RIPE.
The censorship appears to be a more casual
affair in Germany than it was a few months
ago. It may be that the long arm of
Authority has grown tired. It may be that
there are now so many people bursting with
information or opinions that it is difficult
to keep track of them all. It may be that,
by a judicious putting of the blind ear to
the telescope, the news of imminent disaster
is being broken to the nation unofficially.
Anyhow, things are written which would
have seemed impossible when the war was
young. The story of Prussian miscalcula-
tion and unpopularity which leaks out by
degrees is a wonderful affair. A profound
belief in his own plausibility and an equally
profound belief in his destiny and in his
junior partner, the Lord, have led the Pots-
dam heathen astray. Yet if his schemes had
succeeded —and they might have succeeded
but for his enlarged- head, and his sudden
impatience, and his spiked helmet, and his
mailed fist, and his huge feet, and his loud
voice—it looks as if the British Empire
would have been hanging by the skin of its
teeth to the verge of a precipice. It might
even have been over the precipice. The
Prussian’s courage and industry and capacity
for organisation are beyond question. In
these matters he is magnificent. Apparently
the preparations of 26 years or so were
spoiled at the last moment by hurry and big
trampling extremities. When the case required
most careful handling the man in charge
proved to be only a pair of thicksoled boots
crying in the wilderness.
The war, it is alleged, was to commence
in this fashion :' On one side there were to
be Germany, Austria, Italy, Roumania, Bul-
garia and Turkey. On the other side there
were to be only France and Russia, Servia
being wiped out; and the odds were to be
hopeless, both on land and sea. Belgium
was to recognise the position as impossible
and raise no objection. Britain was to let
everything slide because Belgium slid, and
to be so deeply absorbed in commerce that
it didn’t see- where things were drifting.
Later on, when France and Russia had come
to terms and handed over their navies as
part of the indemnity, Britain, with all the
other fleets of the Old World against it,
might be manned down by the dead weight
of ships, and blockaded, and starved into
surrender. So Australia and Maoriland
would become German possessions, and the
Gerhog would own most of the world, and
dictate terms to the rest. Where he ruled
the Gerhog was to be sole landlord, and a
landless race was to minister to his wants
and fetch him his beer. Many years of toil,
of deep thought and of masterly arrange-
ment, had led up to the great event. And
it is surprising to consider, that, if the Prus-
sianOiad been a little less loud and arrogant
and offensive and blinded by conceit, and a
little more diplomatic, the conspiracy would
have had a chance. The slow and wonderful
industry with which the mine was laid was
in strange contrast to the unreasoning haste
with which it was exploded. Possibly the
Kaiser’s ear was worse.
* * * *
The excuse for the war was badly chosen.
The quarrel with Servia aggravated Italy,
for it had already pegged out in its own
mind large areas for itself on the eastern
side of the Adriatic, and it hated to see a
bulky and dubious ally jumping its pro-
spective claim. The ill-selected shindy
caused Roumania and Bulgaria to cool down,
and it made Greece hostile, for these States
all have ah eye on the remaining waste
lands of the peninsula, and they objected
bitterly to any further Austrian intrusion.
Then the Servian disturbance made Austria
a house divided against itself, for its Slav
population has a great deal more sympathy
with its blood relation at Belgrade than with
its German boss or political partner at
Vienna. If an ultimatum had been served
directly on France, on the ground that
Germany didn’t.-like-the smell of the oil
which the President used on his hair, the
proceeding would have been ridiculous, yet
it might have panned out better. An incur-
able quarrel with Norway might have panned
out better. Still the fact remained out-
standing that Italy was pledged to fight
alongside Germany and Austria to the bitter
end, provided these countries were attacked.
And if they had simply proceeded to wallop
Servia good and hard, the Czar, whose
people take their religion and their Slavonic
brotherhood very seriously, would have been
forced, by the pressure of popular opinion,
to make the attack. Then Italy must have
come in, or be a public liar and a shameful
traitor. The Kaiser, his ear being probably
worse than usual, broke in first with his
declaration of war against Russia, and by
being the assailant instead of the assailed
he absolved Italy from its obligations. No
country was more glad to be absolved. The
aid of the big Italian fleet —which is imposing
and allegedly efficient, whatever the Italian
. army may be —was essential to any scheme
of world-wide conquest. Nowadays em-
bittered Germans are saying that, after 26
years of subtle engineering, the best ally
was fooled or blundered away in a moment
of excitement.
* * * *
It was always understood that, when “The
Day” arrived, France must be crushed with
one stupendous effort, and after that the
slower-moving Russian could be dealt with
separately. To put the fear of death into
France the capture of Paris was regarded
as essential. There are two roads to Paris
which avoid the almost impregnable chain
of fortresses on the Franco-German frontier.
One is through the neutral territory of
Switzerland; the other through the neutral
territory of Belgium. These are both
martial countries, but they are very small.
Regarded as obstacles there was little to
choose between them on “The Day.” But
on one hand the occupation of Belgium was
liable to rouse Britain to premature fury,
for J. Bull could have no pleasure in
German settlement so close to his own
coasts; whereas be was hardly likely to take
the remote troubles of Switzerland much to
heart. On the other hand, the road to
Paris via Switzerland is rather the longer
of the two. The question of the route is
said, by German writers, to have been
anxiously debated, and the decision was
disastrous. In the day when Germany, after
a generation of intense thought and drill and
worry, flew off the handle all in a second,
it was decided to throw a brick at the largest
and richest empire on earth, merely to save
a very few days on the road to Paris. An
insane belief in speed at any price appeared
to possess the Kaiser about this time.
Naturally Germany’s three anxiously-looked-
for allies, who were already hanging back,
hung back harder than ever when Britain
was needlessly brought into the trouble on
the other side. They propped so violently
in the harness that their hoofs dug up great
furrows in the ground. And about this time
the Dual Empire, or Empire of the Two-
headed Penny, must have concluded that it
had gone into business with a robust lunatic.
■ir * * *
Whether Prussia was hopeleslsy ill-served
by its diplomatists, or whether it has no
diplomatists at all, but mere arrogant bag-
men ; or whether its foreign agents weren’t
allowed to report anything save what was
calculated to please the Kaiser, no one can
say as yet. But many intelligent Germans
begin to remark that no country was more
grievously deluded than theirs. It was per-
suaded that Belgium wouldn’t oppose it;
that Britain, partly through apathy and
partly because of its troubles in Ireland and
India and Egypt, would lie low; that Russia
was crippled by Labor disturbances; that
Italy was reliable ; that Roumania and Bul-
garia were moderately reliable; and that,
because France has some five or six parties
in its Legislature, it was hopelessly divided.
The Czar was dismissed with contempt as
a mild and peace-loving man. And among
the other estimates the Grand Duke
Nicholas was set down as an amateur
soldier, and a rather faded gambler, and
a man of fashion and pleasure. He
may have posed as a fashionable loafer
in days of peace, but in his present capacity,
as the first commander in history who has
superintended, with fair success, a battle
line 1000 miles long, he seems to be another
evidence of the mistake that was made at
Berlin.
* * * *
The last of the miscalculations which is
now eating into the Prussian vitals is the
over-estimate of Turkey as an ally. Turkey
lias been dry-nursed by the Kaiser and his
entourage for many years. William has
posed as the patron and protector of Islam.
Jerusalem is disfigured to this day because
an ancient gate was torn down and a large
section of the old wall demolished in order
that the megalomaniac of Berlin might ride
in 1.0 abreast, like a Great Jest mounted
on an ass. The churches he founded, and
the places where he condescended to the
Apostles, and the localities where he
approved of the Disciples and disapproved
of Pilate and Judas, are still on view, ine
spots where he prayed are shown at the
usual price. The-Turkish army has been
trained by Germans, and despite its iU-luck
in the recent wars it was apparently held
that an army trained by Germans must be
of the best. Enver Pasha, Minister ot
War, was of German education, so he was
also of the- best. Enver, son-in-law of the
Sultan, and the inveterate pensioner ot
Germany, has been one of the false alarms
of Europe. He has been hailed by all
manner of foreigners as the great organiser,
the regenerator of Turkey, the man who
overthrew the old despotism, the founder of
the Young Turk party, the creator of the
Ottoman Parliament, regarding which noth-
ing is heard nowadays; and as a patriot,
legislator and soldier who was above the
average. He ranked in popular estimation
above such men as Shevket and Nazim,
and in the flurry of self-advertisement nobody
seemed' to remember that, unlike them, he
had never commanded an army in the field,
or done anything wonderful, or in any way
delivered the goods. The fact that this
German pensioner was to lead the Turkish
forces was hailed as an assurance of
triumph. The quality of the army was
guaranteed by the German general von der
Goltz, likewise the quality of its com-
mander. Enver led his army into a hole
and was wrecked, Disasters of that sort
are common enough, but the British or
French or Russian or Spanish or other
European commander, no matter how in-
capable or superannuated he may be, gener-
ally stands by the ruins of his force, and
tries manfully to drag something out of the
ddbris. Enver did nothing of the sort. He
fought his first, and probably his last, battle.
Then he handed over his position to a
German officer and left. If he had put his
reputation into a bag along with a boulder
and two wild cats, and sunk it in deep water,
it could hardly have been more completely
lost.
* * * *
So a feeling grows in Germany that its
loud and arrogant and spike-hatted
diplomacy has beguiled it. Its ambassadors
are so bumptious and self-sufficient that they
get little real information. They are so
purely Prussian in their outlook that they
fail to understand any other nation’s outlook.
They have such a profound faith in corrup-
tion that they are the easy prey of people
like San Giuliano of Italy and Enver of
Turkey. Yet it took the German a long
time to realise that he is a disliked person.
Only when three expected allies fell away
and began to drift into the other camp, and
two unexpected enemies rose up against him
did this tremendous individual comprehend
that nobody regarded his society as indis-
pensable.
THE WAR AND THE COOMA MAIL.
By pretence of the poor old war —which is
quite a new war, and Kitchener is
credited with saying that it won’t really
begin until May—and by the sham or
apology of a very mild and temporary
drought, things promise to happen to certain
N.S.W. railways. A wail comes from the
South, where. it is proposed to abolish the
cheap and unobtrusive daily mail train to
Cooma. This isn’t an express, but merely
a humble plodder, made up of old rolling
stock; yet apparently it will give way to a
“mixed,” otherwise a “Limerick.” On some
smaller lines in the same fertile district tfie
one-train-per-day service is to change to three
trains a week. It is a pity that trouble
should start so early. The business seems
to reflect discredit on the proud Ma State,
with its boast of its boundless natural
resources, its permanent and reproductive
works paid for out of loans, its sound credit,
its brilliant government, its powerful Low
Tariff tendencies (which it has managed to
impose on the Commonwealth), its posses-
sion of the biggest city and the biggest State
population in the Commonwealth, its land
settlement, its industrial legislation and its
general tendency to be a-bright and shining
light. The drought hasn’t been really bad,
except in spots, and the Cooma district
wasn’t one of the most malevolent spots.
There have been worse droughts before, and
there will often be worse ones again. The
war hasn’t cost the State a penny in new
taxes ; all the bill has been met out of loans.
The European disagreement has even been
used as an excuse for bigger loans and a
greater razzle-dazzle than ordinary. Then
the State, having in recent years borrowed
harder than ever before for “reproductive

lation at the date of last census. This is why

works” — i.e., works which not only pay
interest but yield a profit—should be feeling
good and affluent. If its works show a
tendency to burst at the first time of asking
something must be amiss.
* * * *
At June 30, 1914, N.S.W. owned
miles of railway, and over 2000 miles were
worked at a loss. In most cases the loss
was old and chronic. It is a poor business
for all these “reproductive” works to be a
bad debt, but under the present system this
seems inevitable. It is possible to mark off
something like two-thirds of the State as, a
region that was losing population at the date
of last census. The map attached herewith
appeared in The Bulletin a couple of years
ago and it shows in black the fading area.
No apology is offered for its republication.
* * * *
In the circumstances the war is a hollow
mockery of a reason for cutting the Monaro
railway service down to zero. It may be an
excuse or a snuffle or a hypocrisy, but it
isn’t a reason, and the world-wide struggle
has good grounds for a libel action against
somebody. The Cooma railway showed a
dead loss of £38,000 in 1912 and £50,000 in
1913, though these were years of peace and
good crops and good prices. This section is
merely an item in the 2000 miles of N.S.W.
railways which many harassed officials would
gladly shut up and abandon to the moths
and rust, but for the fact that such a deed
would give away the loan policy and the
plausible yarn about “permanent and
reproductive works.” The obvious ambition
of the Sydney Government being to denude
the country districts of population, and!
concentrate everything in the metropolitan
area, it would be well to close the unpayable
railways, and carry the scheme with a slam
and a sudden yelp to its logical conclusion.
The loss on the 2000 miles (to be accurate,
2092 J miles) of non-paying Cornstalk lines
increased from £415,000 in 1913 to close on
£455,000 in 1914. This —also the loss of
population and cattle and sheep and pigs,
and above all the loss of hope, over a vast
section of the State —is a big price to pay
for the gospel of dragging everything to
Sydney. The deficit is made good out of
loans that are charged to posterity—includ-
ing Sydney posterity; out of increased rail-
way charges; increased taxes (which fall
on Sydney as well as on other places) ;
increased city rents (caused by congestion) ;
high food prices (because the food has to
be dragged so far in order that it may reach
the one centre of population), and other
direct and indirect imposts. The business
is a grievous commentary on —well, on some-
thing.
* * * *
The railway to Cooma and Nimmitabel
should be a profitable semi-suburban line
connecting with cities and big oversea ports
at Twofold Bay and Jervis Bay. It should
yield enough profit to make the new income-
tax of 3d. in the £ quite superfluous. It is
about the worst sample of all, because the
better chance a district has of opening up
ports which will compete with Sydney the
more that district must be suppressed. The
tableland is so very far away from the
capital that the wheat and the cow eat their
heads off in transit. By the time they arrive
they cost almost as much in removal
expenses as they are worth. So Sydney
is levied upon to pay for the railway
shortage until it is almost up against the
problem of closing half the existing lines,
and abandoning the larger section of the
State to the crows and rabbits. Perhaps it
might be well to appoint a Royal Commis-
sion to find out why the Ma community is
such a failure. In this matter the war
should be ruled out. The country, as already
mentioned, hasn’t yet begun to pay for that
worry, in cows or wheat or damage or
money; nor has it yet paid much in paen.
Let us be just to everybody—even to a war.
The simple explanation may be that Aus-
tralia isn’t a fertile country, so a city of
800.000 people in Australia has to draw its
food supplies from three or four times the
area which would support a similar city in
Europe.. The transit costs being too great,
Australia shouldn’t have cities of 800,000
people.
PLAIN ENGLISH.
Friends and Borrowers and Loafers and
Importers and Sundries.
This country has too many friends, and
they rally round it too much. They do
nothing for us that we really want done,
but they give us good advice and moral
support, and assume the attitude of Mrs.
Micawber, when she hung round her hus-
band, Wilkins of that ilk, and declared
quite needlessly that she would never desert
him. Australia has just received a business
deputation from Japan. Powerful expres-
sions of business cordiality from the
United States are as plentiful as ants. Both
these countries are of opinion that—one of
them being an
ally and the other
being filled with
the best intentions
towards us we
should buy their
goods in preference
to those of our
inveterate enemies,
Germany, Turkey
and Austria, which
is quite reasonable.
They also consider
that we should
make an extraor-
dinary dash for
their goods. This
isn’t reasonable.
According to this
theory it is plainly
our duty to buy, in
the first place, all
we can from
Britain, Belgium,
France, Russia,
Servia and Montenegro, which are
hard-fighting members of the Alliance.
And as Italy and Roumania and
Portugal are friendly., and Persia has
been dragged into the war on the
British side, everybody who believes
in the importing disease can see
clearly that they also have claims on
our commercial support. Unfortunately
we haven’t enough support to go round.
The supply is limited. Australia is
already importing a great deal more
than it can pay for, to the great detriment
of its own industries and its own chance
of accumulating population, and the struggle
to borrow money with which to meet the bill
for the foreign goods and to renew the old


Joans that are falling due has become terrible.
This nation doesn’t want Japanese or United
States bagmen who will open their samples
and make the sentimental appeal. What it
requires is _ someone who will tell it how
to run big industries of its own ; also some
one who will lend £10,000,000 or so to go
on with. Unfortunately nobody has seen
anybody who looks anything like that per-
son around lately. At present the position
is something like this: We are appealed to
in a strenuous fashion to buy more goods
from certain allies or friends. Unless we
refuse flatly to do anything of the sort, and
also knock £2O,OGC,COO or £25,000,000 per
year off our present imports from allies and
friends, we must keep on borrowing from our
father Bull in order to make ends meet, he
being the only person outside Australia
who lends to us. If Bull is unable to lend
to us on account of the war- 1 nstralia, on
the present system, will apparently go plain
broke or bankrupt within a year, and the
parent in the North Sea will strike a very
serious loss just when he is least able to
stand it. The question is, whether this is a
fair and reasonable way to treat any parent
in the North Sea. Unless Australia is pre-
pared to put its tariff sky-high, and to
greatly reduce its supply of foreign (and
British) luxuries, and to do a lot more
work for itself, it must needs make it clear
to the old man, in the midst of his responsi-
bilities, that unless he puts up more money
the money he has already put up will be in
great danger. This is a case of bushranging
the progenitor. Only a low-tariffist or a
hardened borrower or a born loafer or a
German spy would treat the progenitor like
that.
A System Which Ought to be Dead.
The Liberal press, which opposed compul-
sory service for as long as it dared, and is
largely to blame for the immaturity of our
trainees, is now engaged fighting what it
vails “conscription.” One paper says that
“because of a higli tradition of liberty,” it
is inadvisable to compulsorily train, arm
and equip men between 21 and 35, though
that sheet, in common with the local Liberal
party, has long since dropped its objections
to universal service for lads under the voting
age. Another supports the voluntary sys-
tem because “on the whole it gets the best
men.” All the world over the voluntary
system gets in peace-time the worst men.
Without question, it gets in war-time some
of the very best. Each of the Expeditionary
contingents contained numbers of youngsters
who had cheerfully abandoned pleasant, not
to say luxurious, lives. To say, however,
that all the flower of the community’s youth
and vigor was included would be to state one
of those frothy things which go well enough
at aldermanic banquets, but only make clear-
visioned folks feel tired. The case of the
Broken Hill unmarried men who were re-
fused Government jobs is significant. At the
beginning of the war they believed in the
brotherhood of man, and were prepared to
assault anyone who scoffed at the doctrine.
Then a couple of Turks raised the green flag
of Islam, and conducted a Holy War for as
long as a train-load of picnickers was within
range of their rifles. The young men of
Broken Hill at ohce abandoned their brother-
hood principles, slew the Turks, and helped
to burn the local German Club —an irrele-
vant proceeding, this last, whichever way it
was regarded. Later, being hard up, they
tried to blackmail the tradespeople. That
failed, and at latest advices they were pre-
paring to volunteer for the front. Does this
represent large-souled patriotism on the part
of the bachelors? Or is it rather the bache-
lors’ notion of making the best of gloomy in-
dustrial prospects? Under the “voluntary”
system you get men who, like those of
Broken Hill, are driven to it, and who
arrive so late that, but for good luck, the
Empire might have been dead before they
turned up; and you get too few brave
and efficient Australians who risk their
lives in a pure spirit of patriotic altruism.
The most valuable soldier —other things
equal—is the most valuable citizen ; the type,
that is to say, who by his intelligence,
energy and resource is rising to the top. In
thousands of cases this type would be de-
lighted to fight, but he has already risen so
high, and in doing so has incurred so many
family business and other liabilities, that he
is loth to leave. Who can argue, seriously,
that the system which misses this huge class
is a good one? As soon as the press ceases
from chloroforming the public with ultra-
optimistic war-news, and as soon as it sum-
mons up the nerve to tell its readers that the
war is not nearly over, and that the nation’s
life, is still in danger, the sooner two desirable
things will happen. In the first place the
politicians will be driven to foster industries
which will enable the Commonwealth to
equip and arm itself for War, on a large
scale. And above all, compulsory service, on
a broader scale than we have known hither-
to, will be brought near.
Useful Work for the Censor at Last.
Party Government takes no more account
of Patriotism than burglary does. Both
businesses continue unaffected by war or any
other national menace. The Liberal party,
being out of office in the Australian Parlia-
ment, is acting in the customary manner.
It is contending, directly and by means of
innuendo, that Australia is “failing in its
duty to the Empire,” that the Common-
wealth’s “poor response” has rendered it a
byword among the Allies, and that the Gov-
ernment, by its inaction, has lost the confi-
dence of the electors. As a side-line, Liberals
are claiming that “the very class which
should volunteer” (namely, the working
class) is not doing so; that tire Britisli-born
in our midst are surging forward in dispro-
portionate numbers; and that the rank and
file of Australians are poltroons. This paper
has never had any use for the volunteer system.
If its ideal of years back had been fulfilled,
Australia would have been in a position to
meet the present crisis with a trained and
equipped army capable of going anywhere
and doing anything. But to insist on the
value of universal service is not to say that
the bulk of the youth of the country will
shirk fighting when the need arises. The
party politicians know perfectly well that
there is no shortage of volunteers, and that
there is not likely to be so long as the
Empire is in danger. They know that the
Britisli-born are no keener than the Aus-
tralian-born, and that the working classes
are as courageous as the shop keeping or
clerking or importing classes, if not more so.
But it is considered to be bad party business
either to admit it or to hint at what every-
body knows is the real embarrassment. That
being so, the Censor’s Department might
take a hand, in the interests both of har-
mony at home and the Commonwealth
reputation abroad. It is not permitted for
Australian papers to reflect in any way upon
one of our Allies or even upon a possible
ally. If a journal went completely mad and
suggested, for example, that King Albert of
Belgium was a mean-souled craven, it would
be leapt upon, not for being a ridiculous liar,
but for the graver offence of creating discord
where sentiments of an opposite nature are
desirable. Punishment would likewise follow
if a newspaper reflected on the morale of the
British or French or Russian troops, or in
a.ny other way assisted to raise the fainting
spirit of the enemy. Why should this variety
of charity only begin abroad? Where is the
sense in forbidding offensive remarks about
Cossacks and the like, who neither read our
papers nor are interested in our opinions,
while allowing every Liberal leaguer in the
community to heap scorn on Australians and
insult them at will?
The Loafing; Patriot.
Whenever a certain class of Imperial
patriot in Australia wants to help the
Motherland, his notion is to export some-
thing in a raw and unfinished condition, and
then sit back and protrude his chest and
give himself three cheers for his spirit and
keen understanding of the needs of the
situation. This class of Imperialist has
always been readier to send the Common-
wealth’s wool, hides and metals to be treated
abroad than to deal with them here. His
disingenuous argument was that no true
patriot would raise a tariff wall against the
Motherland. Yet effective Protection in the
last 10 years would have helped the Empire
now by attracting to Australia many of the
British-born emigrants who, for lack of the
industries which a tariff creates, have
settled down as U.S. citizens. And, further-
more, Australia’s raw products have played
an important part in building up the
manufactures, and hence the wealth, of the
nations which are now striving to deal the
Empire its death-blow. When the naval
scare arose half a dozen years ago, the
Empire Day patriot’s conception of the
Commonwealth’s duty was the despatch of a
naked and unmanned Dreadnought to the
North Sea. Joe Cooic said, in effect, that
he was prepared to borrow the money for
20 of these craft, if necessary. The old
spirit still lives. Senator Millen, having
pointed out that there are. difficulties in the
way' of equipping and training large bodies
of troops locally, the Sydney ‘Telegraph—
the sternest Freetrader and frothiest Dread-
noughter of them all in the past —had this
typical suggestion to make :
It would be well to enlist all the suitable men who
offer, and send them for Lord Kitchener to train and
equip—at Australia’s charge.
The Telegraph might have mentioned that
Australian manufacturers, if given the
encouragement of a high duty, and an assur-
ance that the tariff would not be lowered
at the end of the war, might fall to and do
the equipping themselves; while the training
difficulty, acute as it is, can be overcome
by organisation. But that is not Liberalism’s
way. When it wants to be helpful and
patriotic its first thought is to borrow money,
hire British transports, fill them with
unarmed men in civilian clothes, deliver the
lot at Kitchener’s embarrassed feet, and
go home proudly, making contemptuous
remarks about “conscription.”

How He Died.
“Petronius Earriter” and his curse: —
“Death.: —Sometime during 1914, at Sydney, in
the State of New South Wales, the venerable party
known as PUBLIC OPINION, of senile decay, com-
plicated by machine-politics and other ailments. A
colonist of many years’ standing, brought out by the
very late Dr. Lang and other energetic citizens.
PUBLIC OPINION had endeared himself to the whole
community of free Australians, but of late years he
was altogether overshadowed by modern and un-
scrupulous competition on the part of certain daily
newspapers, which took up an impostor known as
SPURIOUS PUBLIC OPINION, and constantly pre-
sented him to the people as the real party. Unable
to face the fierce competition, and being totally in-
articulate for years, the deceased gradually sank, and
died at Parliament House, between Hunter and King
streets, Sydney. The doctors in final attendance on
deceased were Unblushing Jobbery, Unlimited
Loans, Axe-Grinder, Government Stroke, Standing-
In, Apathy, Ignorance, Sheer Bluff, Hu&hitup,
Damthexpense and other distinguished medicoes.
The funeral will take place immediately. If the war
lasts long enough a happy resurrection may be ex-
pected.
The above advertisement, or something like it,
ought to be inserted in every paper in the Ma State.
Under cover of the war, which, seemingly, is vastly
wider than the cloak of Charity, and thicker than
the Magic Carpet of Bagdad, every sin of omission
and commission committed and omitted by the
McGowen-Holman-Bull-Coiien Government is being
passed over, condoned, palliated and forgiven. This,
of course, is great and strong and chivalrous and
altogether magnificent, but it isn’t going to help
Ma in her coming times of trouble and tribulation
and hustling to find the interest wherewith to meet
the awful bills that must presently come rolling in.
The first absolutely unmistakable evidence of the
death of Public Opinion was given at the close of the
last session of Ma’s deplerable Assembly, when all
the Estimates were rushed through without pretence
at discussion, or even apology! The next Was the
bestowal on that talented galaxy of Strong Borrowers
f —Holman, Griffith, Carmichael and co. of free-life
passes (gold) on the Railways, each pass inscribed
on the back : “For Distinguished Service to the State.’’
Not a word of protest came from any quarter. Yet
these politicians are now in the happy position of
being well able to pay for their railway travelling,
When —if ever it should unfortunately happen—they
are slung out of Parliament. Of course, 20 years
ago things might have been different —probably they
were different —but considering how well they have
done out of the country (as distinguished from doing
well by the country), and considering how hard up
N.S.W. is getting and is likely to get, largely owing
to their craze for foreign loans, it might have been
thought that Holman and co. would have nobly
declined the golden offering, and thereby have set a
. good example to poor, dead-broke Posterity.
The Free Pass system on the Ma State’s railways—
the railwaj'S that cost so much to build and run, and
that pay so badly, even with the increased freights
and fares —has assumed the proportions of a public
scandal; but, as Public Opinion is dead and buried,
nobody worries. Yet, perhaps, the handing-out to
affluent Ministers of gold free passes for life may
prove to be the last straw that sprained the jaw of
the ass. Years ago the Melbourne Age published the
Victorian “free list” under Speight’s glorious regime.
It ran, I believe, to over 10,000 people who, in the
vast majority of cases, were perfectly well able to
pay their railway fares till Kingdom Come ! That
settled the popular Speight in the public mind. The
Boom had burst and money was tight—just as Ma is
finding things now—and an infuriated proletariat,
headed by an indignant press, demanded reform —•
and get it. But, as already mentioned," in the Ma
State poor old Pub. Op. is dead. In the sacred name
of the War the Holman crowd can do anything, from
appointing three enormously rich firms to seize wheat
on a lavish commission to declaring beer a necessary
of life.
♦
Which Is It?
A forgotten ghost wakened again in Sydney
last week, when a question arose about the
lighting and drainage of Calico Town. Most
people thought that both Calico Town and
the State wheat-growing business were dead,
along with the Holman Government’s
scheme for handing over the construction
of public works and the flotation of loans to
the Private Enterprise firm of Norton
Griffiths and Co. The Holman crowd
has so many sudden schemes, and they drop
so suddenly down so many sudden holes,
that the deadness of Calico Town was almost
taken for granted. The place was started
because, so it was said, the teeming popula-
tion of the State couldn’t be provided with
sufficient house accommodation by the
private landlord, or by the simple process
of building its own cottage on day labor
principles. Now it is proposed to cut down
the railway services on many country lines,
the plea being that the population doesn’t
teem sufficiently to keep the old services going.
Something ought to he done by way of
restoring a balance. What with Socialistic
wheat; the transfer of the whole Socialistic
wheat-buying business of the State to three
rich Private Enterprise firms at an
exorbitant commission ; the proposal to hand
over the building of Socialistic railways to
Private Enterprise at a big profit;
the proposal to reduce the service on the
Socialistic railways; the proposal to house
a section of the people in Socialistic calico
houses, which are semi-transparent, so that
Private Enterprise outside can watch the
lady Socialist going to bed ; the raising of
Private Enterprise loans; the wholesale
importation of foreign cheap-labor goods on
foreign Private Enterprise ships; the
enthusiasm for the Private Enterprise book-
maker as against the Socialistic tote, and a
few other things, N.S.W. has a dazed feeling,
and is holding its aching forehead with its
hoof. It really doesn’t know whether it has
the most Socialistic Government or the most
Private Enterprise one on earth.
Now that the first enthusiasm has worn off,
and Belgian heroism is a rather ancient
tale, people begin to say that the admiration
was overdone, and that Belgium, in propor-
tion to its population, isn’t putting as many
soldiers into the field as Britain. The latter
statement is absolutely correct. Belgium
might even be quoted as a horrible example.
It was a peaceful country like Britain, and
though it raised a few troops by the com-
pulsory process it depended mostly on volun-
tary enlistment. So far as circumstances
would allow, it trod in Bull’s footsteps.
When war struck the two countries each
badly wanted to improvise armies. The dif-
ference lay in the fact that Bull had time
to improvise armies because the sea is a
useful barrier, and Belgium, with no sea
barrier, hadn’t time. Half the population
was unavailable for recruiting purposes in-
side a fortnight—in fact a great deal of it
was unavailable inside three days. And
very soon nine-tenths of it was not only un-
available, because the Gerhog had got it
down and had sat on its head, but it was
being looted of money and supplies for the
support of the invader. The little army
fought splendidly, and the little corner of
the country which is still Belgium has done
all that humanity could do to keep the forces
un to fighting strength. But the country
which followed in Bull’s footsteps wasn’t
ready. And Bull, following in his own foot-
steps, might have struck precisely the same
disaster but for the fact that God, in a
happy moment, put the sea between him and
his enemies. Probably both Bull and Bel-
gium will have compulsory training after
this. For want of it the latter lias struck
the great disaster of modern history, and
the former has had the sc~_e of his life.
«.
The present year will be remembered in
history as the time when the Turk Went
Mad. That fezzed and tarbooshed person
gaily took on Russia in the North, and
Britain in the Persian Gulf and on the
Egyptian border. He did this on the incite-
ment of a stunted Pole who was educated
in Germany, and who had crowned his wild
career by marrying the Sultan’s daughter.
Then Turkey began to look for new enemies
by expelling Greek residents and confiscating
their property, and by threatening a general
massacre of foreigners, who are mostly
Greeks and Italians. And just when Persia
was buried in sleep as usual, and. trying to
avoid all annoyance, it was wakened by an
inrush of Turkish soldiers who were feeling
fresh and looking for more trouble. Appar-
ently some ghost arose and hung out the old
flag of the Blacksmith’s Apron; for the
astonished Persians, though they were licked
in the first encounter, seem to have argued the
point hard, and a local governor is reported to
have stood on the bridge at midnight with 400
soldiers, and covered the retreat of the local
population until lie had only four men left.
The only possible inference is that the Un-
speakable, finding he has committed suicide,
has filled himself up with drugs and is kick-
ing everybody and everybody’s dog and cat
promiscuously. The two Turks who
declared war against Australia at Broken
Hill probably represented the national feel-
ing with accuracy.
“A.C.P.”: The title of Boss Shark, so
long the possession of Gent One, threatens
to change hands in N. S. Wales. The new
claimant there is the land agent who makes
a speciality of land ballots, and he has
been gorging himself among the flatheads.
The present Government has made numer-
ous subdivisions, and the usual method is to
ballot for the blocks. That’s where the
quid-shark comes in. First of all the cocky
or farm-hand who wants land gets a large
blue paper. Like all Government blue
papers it is a formidable document with ter-
rible threats about the Oaths Act, and from
15 to 20 questions which must be answered
and the whole signed in the presence of a
J.P. The cocky or farm-hand is beaten be-
fore he starts, and is mostly on the verge of
a nervous breakdown before he is half-
way through it. Then enters the agent, who
will fill it in—for anything from 10s. 6d. to
a guinea. Then next thing is the Land
Board, which usually sits so far away from
where the applicant lives that there’s no
hope of his appearing. Not that there’s ever
much necessity for him to appear; but
there’s the chance that the chairman will
ask a few questions. So the agent consents
to put off an important job and appear in-
stead—for another fl. The Land Board
sits with the applications in front of it.
Those that look O.K. are put into the ballot
without a word. Any that look hopeless are
thrown out, also without a word, whether
the applicant has paid his fl to the agent
or not. If there’s a doubtful case the cocky
is called upon to answer a few questions
on' oath. If the agent is appearing he is
asked the questions.. But as he has very
probably never seen the applicant and knows
no more about him than is on the form, he
might as well be at home or in gaol or dead.
One agent who specialises in this line
bandied as many as 1300 applications in a
single case. In Tatt.’s the party who col-
lects the ticket-money pays out the prizes;
but in this gamble the agent pockets the
money and the Government hands out the
prizes, if there are any. The Government
seems quite satisfied to let things go on as
they are; so does the agent. Here and
there a cocky wakes up and growls, but
the cocky is far away from Sydney; and
anything that is far away from Sydney
doesn’t matter.
A Moving Appeal to the Censor.
[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
Great Personage, needless to say I approach
you with all due deference and humility,
Respectfully toning down my usual ferocious
language to the best of my mediocre
ability ;
For I understand, or at least partly appre-
hend, or adumbrate, the extreme delicacy
of your position
In this time of War. or in Springtime, or
any old time. Be pleased, therefore,
favorably to consider this my humble
petition.
Imprimis , honored Sir, I wish you to under-
stand distinctly that lam not pro-
Teuton, #
Nor am I anxious to afford, or impart, infor-
x mation calculated to aid or help the
quaint Germanic brute on.
The Fog of War, as far as lam concerned,
may lighten or may grow even denser,
But may I ask, with the greatest respect,
why—• (Remainder of line eliminated
by the Censor.)
Further, on behalf of the public, which
seems to be too tired, or cowed, or in-
different, or all three together,
I make obeisance, and remark politely, even
ingratiatingly, that we are having extra-
ordinary weather;
Indeed, a freak season, for which there
appears to be neither rhyme nor reason.
Why is it, and whence, Sir?
You will earn our undying gratitude if you
will allow us to know—■ (The rest is
deleted by the Censor.)
Again, with awe and proper appreciation, I
would implore you to lift momentarily
the dread curtain
Which shrouds things from the view of Aus-
tralia and leaves her quite amazed and*
highly uncertain;
And, if I may instance one thing more than
another, I would urgently request you
to state why it is that all our politicians
just now are sitting astride of the fence,
Sir,
None daring to speak the truth or openly to
censure the mysterious and uncomfort-
able things that are going on— (The
rest struck out by the Censor.)
I learn from the S. M. Herald, otherwise
Grandmamma —or, rather, I am told by
her —and also the D.T., affectionately
called Aunt ’Tilda,
That the Germans are still in Berlin and
Belgium, and a few odd ones at Potts
Point and St. Kilda ;
That a great battle is raging at , and
that the situation in is steadily
growing much tenser,
And, these serious things being so, I woidd
ask with courtesy why on earth they—
(Conclusion of line suppressed by the
Censor.)
As already remarked, I comprehend some-
what of the enormous difficulties of your
. unparalleled position,
Which strikes me vibratingly as between
that of the Kaiser and that of the head
of the Spanish Inquisition,
Plus a soupeon of super sub-editor who
“cuts” quite regardless of all trouble
and expense, Sir;
But do you not think that even omniscience
and omnipotence should at times per-
mit- —- (Remainder of sentence excised
by the Censor.)
In conclusion, I trust that you will forgive
my regretful persistence and degraded
thirst for information
Regarding the things I have alluded to; and.
with your gracious consent, I should
like to add a small query concerning
our beloved Lord Mayor and Corpora-
tion ;
Also a few unworthy and insignificant ques-
tions to your honored Self about our
State finances and the Federal Capital
- —continually assuring you that my
admiration for you is immense, Sir;
For I recognise to the full that we can only
beat the Germans and save the Empire
by indomitable, unprecedented courage,
determination and secrecy in prepar-
ing—- (Rest of this matter sternly
prohibited and rigorously excised by the
Censor.)

the facts.
Our Managing Director when in
Sheffield some months ago had ordered
some thousands of lines from one of
the great makers of silver goods, and
casually remarked, “if in slack times
you could turn out a 10-inch Entree
Dish of the best nickel, hard-soldered
throughout, so much deposit of silver
at so much we could order them by
the hundred.”

War lessened the silver manufacturing in England. Machinery deteriorates if idle.

wear like silver for a lifetime.

The Shindy of the Butcher of Potsdam.
The week has been one of snow and frost
and mist and misery over most of Europe.
There have been thaws in between times,
and then there have been floods. The Ger-
hog has enjoyed the first large and definite
success which has come his way*since the
battle of Ostrograd. A French force seem-
ingly took reckless chances in the fog in the
hope of surprising the enemy; and found
altogether too much of the enemy. A thaw
and a sudden rising of the rivers cut off its
reinforcements, so it fought a magnificent
but hopeless battle and lost heavily. This
isolated event was so greatly exaggerated at
Berlin that for one wild beer-stained minute
the capture of London seemed imminent.
Then it was probably realised that the vic-
tory looked big merely because victories are
rare. On the Russo-German border the Bear
makes a little progress every day, amid
appalling burial. On the Russo-Austrian
border the Austrian defence has almost
ceased, but the snow-drifts in the Carpa-
thians have hung up operations. Austria
takes advantage of the respite to try to
back out of the war. Berchtold, Minister
for Foreign Affairs, has thrown in his port-
folio with the advice that his country should
make peace on the best possible terms, and
thus avoid utter ruin, and that it
should leave William of Potsdam in
the lurch. This, move is calculated
to hurry up Roumania and Italy to
join the Allies. Both of them apparently
intended to come in just too late to do much
hard work and just in time to assist at pick-
ing the bones of decrepit Austria. If Austria,
even at a great sacrifice, can get clear of its
German alliance, and of its war with Russia,
France, Britain, Belgium and Servia, it may
be able to tell Italy and Roumania that
they won’t get any of its bones without a
sheol of a fight. The whole business is
full of complications, but the position seems
to be that Austria must make peace quickly
and the other two Powers must make war
quickly. An earthquake has devastated
Italy, and delayed its military preparations,
which fact may help in the end to save the
ruins of the Two-headed Empire. The
Russian still plods through the snows of
Armenia in pursuit of the broken Turk. In
Palestine a large, shambling army, full of
camels and muddle and deserts and dis-
affection and quarrels between German and
Turkish officers, is endeavoring to take the
dry road for Egypt, but the Egyptian in-
vasion appears to be a joke these days. The
Turk never was a road-maker or a well-
sinker or a tank-constructor, and he finds
himself hampered by his deficiencies. The
Kaiser’s fleet fails to show itself on the
high seas. All the nations at war —except
the cold-feet empire of Austria —are ad-
mittedly preparing for a gigantic effort _ in
the spring, when the weather becomes mild,
and the wild flowers come out, and the
trees put on their garniture of green, and
the small bird lays its small egg in its small
nest. Then the world will probably know
whether this is to be a three years struggle,
or whether the bottom is going to fall all
of a sudden out of the Kaiser’s devices,
because the last coin has been spent and the
last sausage eaten. Meanwhile everything
is a dreary* record of slush and corpses—
except, of course, about Jerusalem, where
the Ottoman army has probably finished the
contents of the pool of Hezekiah and the
pool of Siloam, and most other drinkables,
and would welcome some slush.
When Holman, the barrister, dasFed into
the job of being a New South Wales wheat
monopolist, he fell over more obstacles than
he expected. This is one of them: The
Cornstalk, farmer is forced to sell his scanty
crop cheaply to the Government, per medium
of the Government’s highly-paid Private
Enterprise agents. He can’t even fill orders
from Victoria, though Victoria may offer
a better price. Then the wheat is sold
cheaply to the N.S.W. miller. The miller
sends flour over to Victoria and undercuts
the Victorian miller by a trifle, and so gets
the business, yet he makes, at the expense
nf the N.S.W. farmer, a bigger profit than
does the Victorian miller. This makes the
Victorian miller almost as wild as the
N.S.W. farmer. The N.S.W. baker on the
border, being helped in his wild career by
cheap wheat taken compulsorily from the
N.S.W. farmer, is said to be carrying bread
across the Murray, and cutting out the. Vic-
torian baker, and the Victorian baker wants
to brain him with a stale roll. As a result
of all this confusion, some Victorians are
acquiring flour mills, or interests in flour
mills, in N.S.W., so that they may get cheap
wheat from the Government’s Compulsory
Wheat Purchase Bureau, and send the pro-
duct across into their own State. There is
anger, and confusion, and complication, and
jobbing, and speculating, and making of
money, and losing of money, and joyful
millers and bakers, and infuriated millers
and bakers. The one man who plods drearily
along the level track is the N.S.W. farmer.
For him there is no excitement and no
gamble.

It’s unfortunate for a section of Sydney
theatre-goers that the Palace is not in their
line of vision. No matter what is put on
they don’t see it. Hence they miss such
good things as the Beaumont Smith season.
Sydney has not been offered two more
entertaining comedies than “Who’s the
Lady” and “The Chaperon.” Both of them
are refreshing, quite unlike the stock comedy
that perennially appears wearing new store
clothes and a fresh name, smart and well-
played ; yet, instead of the house being
packed every night, it has been —well, not
so packed. “The Chaperon’’ is, perhaps, a
little more farcical than its predecessor,
while being more feasible (if feasibility has
any business to be mentioned in the same
sentence as farce-comedy). The story
whirls round the substitution of one of the
“nuts” about town for the professional male
chaperon at a gay restaurant. We’ll say
that you, being a staid, highly-respected
importer, are led astray and turn up at the
Star and Garter with Junette de Villiers,
from the Royal chorus. You are made free
from further trouble (for the time being)
by the chaperon. He is “Mr. Jones.”
Junette is “Mrs. Jones.” You are their
guest. .Here, then, enters, Christopher Pot-
tinger,' M.P., with Rosy Gaythorne ; _ and
Hilary Chester (late attache at the British
Embassy, and a hard nut) does the chape-
roning in the unregrettable absence of the
professional hand. It’s a joyous evening
that follows, and Tom Shelford, as Chester,
is the two ends and the middle of it.

To-night (Thursday) Nellie Stewart will
revive “Sweet Nell” at Sydney Royal. The
season closes with the second performance

“The Babes in the Wood” panto, is still
on view at Sydney Adelphi, _ and though
prices are the same, the show is, of course,
better than ever. Still, the job of saying so
is beginning to grow wearisome, especially
as there is no prospect of the Babes being
driven out of the wood, or growing into
flappers and flying out to find a soldier of
their very own to hang on to. Meanwhile
the writer has no option but to keep on
imploring everyone to book a seat and watch
Miss Elsie Sloan, the charming fairy of the
panto., deal it out to the Kaiser. She is
armed only with a small electric light and
two principal boys, while Kitchener and
Joffre have unlimited money and men; and
still they don’t win nearly as much success
as she does.

Except that Wright and Dietrich have
returned from the other States and Isabelle

was last week. In fact, it isn’t violently
unlike what it was the week before that.
Next Saturday night ( January 23) _the
White City, at Rushcutter’s Bay (Sydney;,
will introduce the star thrill of the swsmj,
when a high-diver will project himself from
a burning skyscraper into a tank ot ware •
This is reckoned to be one of the riskiest
forms of earning a crust m the show bus
ness. Nevertheless, there will be no extra
charge. The thrill is thrown in gratis witU

“THE CHAPERON," AT SYDNEY
PALACE.
The menu for the week at Melbourne
Princess’s is “A Girl’s Temptation,” in four
hashes, the wickedest ingredient whereof is
one Klaw. This sinner’s object is to marry
the leading work girl in a lawful manner,
he having stolen the easy and accessible
papers which prove that her dejected father
is the rightful owner of the Warren mil-
lions. Meanwhile the wrong millionaire s
son has eloped with the work girl, and the
hot curses of their respective parents scorch
the track they have _ taken. The wrong
millionaire, accompanied by an evil Lady
Constance and a flabby Cholly of noble
lineage, goes in quest of his offspring and
discovers him at a cottage. Further temp-
tation is then offered to the Girl. She is
always getting temptation and turning it
down. Firstly, the evil Constance offers her
500 golden goblins on condition that she
“gives up” her lover, and nextly the old
man promises an income of £2OO a year,
plus a baby bonus. But nothing, can induce
Kate to relinquish her lugubrious young
man. Finally Klaw bursts upon her in a
bedroom scene and smothers her with burn-
ing kisses, of which the chuckle-headed
author of her prospective infant is an eye-
witness, owing to a forged telegram. The
hugging incident puts the lid on Kate’s pot
of sorrow. By the time her own dear babe
is born its co-parent has taken to drink to
drown his false impressions of the bedroom
scene, and she —poor Girl! —is adrift on a
cold world. Two or three other “drunks’
manage to save Kate from the clutches of
Klaw. A festive bloke in a gaudy jersey
has something to say about the stolen papers,
and a chronic inebriate named Annie makes
a point of falling helplessly behind a hedge
whenever Klaw and Constance are plotting
mischief. Also a small panto, policeman,
whose baton resembles a stolen sausage,
always does his best for Virtue in the harle-
quinade episodes. Klaw when last seen was
being led to retribution by the comic bloke
in the garment of many colors. After which
the real stonebroke heir to the Warren
millions- told his brother that he didn’t want
’em, and Lady Constance was warned off
the premises.
* * * *
The quaintest absurdity in “A Girl’s
Temptation” is the fact that the lovers are
shown by the stolen papers to be half-brother
and sister, and their baby, therefore, is half-
nephew to both parents. But the story
otherwise is a maze of droll happenings in
its non-comedy passages. Among the serious
people Miss ■ Dorise is a graceful young
heroine, who spaaks feelingly and looks as
though she meant it, but always in a rather
underdone style. She will want another
year, at least, in the- fire of bellowdrama, ere
her talent is quite cooked. Roland Conway
is a doleful hero who reminds one of prayer
and meditation, though he bucks up like a
good sinner when he is required to wipe
the floor with Beckett the Base. The
saddest of the other serious people is billed
as Harry' Gold, though he hasn’t a dwt. of
precious metal in his mummering. Kelway
and Kehoe are humorous as an impossible
policeman and a convincing Cholly, whilst
J. Kirby, a young actor, gives a highly active
and intelligent presentment of a son of Beer.
Next Saturday the inevitable girl will be
“Brought to Ruin.”
$ $ $
“Cinderella” is now in its fifth week at
Her Majesty’s (Melb.), and a panto, no
older than that is not yet past its
prime. Thusfar it shows no change to speak
of, except that the angels of the ballet smile
more sweetly and one or two of the gags
seem the worse for wear. The hand of Time
puts finishing touches to all pantoic things
—bar the jokes that were finished before
they came into the business. For instance,
the reference to Kaiser Bill and St. Helena.
*
The above remarks apply also to the panto,
at Melbourne King’s, where the ladies
of the royal harem seem to love as
they please, and Sinbad is carried out to
sea aboard his mother’s back-yard. Five
weeks ago that shapely mariner started to
burgle the Diamond Yalley, since when it
has been added to the British Empire eight
times a week.

“Bought and Paid For” continues to go
strong at Melbourne Royal, and Robert
Stafford will knock a hole through Virginia’s
bedroom door every evening until further
notice.

The re-appearance of George Hall, anec-
dotist, was the only change in the
Melbourne Tivoli bill last Saturday. Odiva
and the Seals are revelling in the wet as
before, and the tank is now open to swim-
ming contestants of both sexes on dates
stated in the advts. Mixed bathing comes
due on Friday (29th). Also genial Laura
Guerite is still singing and burlesquing;
likewise the Randell-Jackson Co. Kingston
twines his spinal cord around his neck, and
the Ascots step-dance for the last time.
* * * *
The Lessos are the brightest constellations
in the Melbourne Bijou’s firmament this
week. The feminine side of the turn is
addicted to rifle practice, while the mascu-
line part works hard in divers feats of
jugglery. People still retain good opinions
of Ella Airlee, and' the novel Davies and
Gledhill cycling act _ mixes muscle with
mechanics in engaging quantities. As
regards the Brown and Lawson cullud duo,
the best that can be said is that the lady
has a gift for throwing herself about, while
the gent, is merely an average coon suffer-
ing from the conventional niggah comedian’s
emphatic foot and mouth.
“W.A.R.”: I am getting tired of the cheap
German buttock war-cartoon of the daily
papers. The cartoonist invariably shows
a fat, frightened Hogman, running from
a triumphant Highlander or Tommy
or Cossack or Pioupiou, who. is in-
variably thrusting a bayonet into the
tempting German hindquarter. The Hog-
man is not running from the bayonet; he
is running with a bayonet to meet a bayonet,
and in any case he hasn’t for many months
run very far. The picture, of an
Australian pig-sticking a fleeing Hog-
man is, in any case, not calculated to stir
enthusiasm in the heart of an Australian.
Let us have cartoons of Australians bravely
making and meeting attacks, bayoneting a
brave foe somewhere else than in the fleeing
pants, and the enlistments would improve,
for the Australian wants to go fighting, not
hog-sticking. Besides, a bayonet-wound in
the enemy’s last resource is not likely to do
much harm, except to prevent the Hogman
sitting down comfortably. And the Hogman
is too busy just now to think about sitting
down.
Certain N.S.W. farmers are trying to get
the Inter-State Commission to injunct the
Holman Government from proceeding with
its Wheat Bill. They have reason. The
Bill airily declares all wheat contracts void,
thus affecting to save either party from
being sued for breach. But suppose a wheat
contract were entered into in June, the
buyer being in the Victorian jurisdiction.
What will happen if the seller owns pro-
perty in Victoria, and the buyer sues him
for breach in the Victorian Court, gets
judgment, and executes on his Victorian
assets? Or suppose that somewhere
between June and December the buyer
wanted cash and got financed by a bank out-
side N. S. Wales and gave a lien on the crop
as collateral for the loan. How many law-
yers will it take to wrangle out the points
of law involved ? Gerrymandering with com-
mercial contracts is always and everywhere
the straight road to perdition. Here it has
been done so recklessly that the effect on
contracts entered into with buyers in juris-
dictions outside the State has apparently
not been thought of.

The Florence Young party, including Reg
Roberts, Claude Bantock and Edmund
Sherras, are doing well enough in Maori-
land under the Stephenson-Linley direction.
The attraction is “The Climax,” which min-
gles comedy and pathos, and provides three
song opportunities for the leading lady.
The art of puff-paragraphy has made a
further advance in the case of Dolly Castles
and her lost jewellery. Dolly’s diamonds and
things were not stolen or burgled in the old,
orthodox, dramatic way. No. “Some valued
pieces of jewellery slipped through the Port
Melbourne pier when she was meeting her
sister, Miss Amy Castles.” That bit of
luck allowed Dolly and Amy to be dragged
in.
“L.H.P.”: I think Australia’s finest pro-
duction of “Sinbad” was at Sydney Royal
in the Easter of 1889, under the direction of
Teddy Royce. Royce played Tinbad, and
the massive Edith Blande was Sinbad.
Others in the cast were Johnny Gourlay,
Fanny Liddiard, Fred Dark, Harry Leston,
Sophie Harris and Bert Royle (now manag-
ing for Williamson in M.L.). Mary Weir,
now Mrs. J. C. Williamson, made a fascinat-
ing Columbine to the clown of Johnny
Gourlay and harlequin of G. Matthews. The
“book” was in three acts, and John Brunton
and George Gordon painted some superb
sets. Marie Reddall, of the London Gaiety,
did the ballets. Then Charles Westmacott
put up a capital “Sinbad” at Sydney Her
Majesty’s in the Christmas season of 1896-7,
with Bert Royle as librettist and Johnny
Wallace as producer. Stella Esdaile was
the mariner, and others were Ada Baker,
Will Crackles, Joe Tolano, D’Arcy Stan-
field, Frank Lawton, Eva Clements. Gor-
don’s transformation scene was wonderful.
This feature was omitted in subsequent pan-
tomimes.

“D.” : Gen6e has come back to the stage.
They always do. The calls of the East and
the Wild and the Blood are nothing to that
of the Boards. Patti has retired 40 times.
I was at one of her farewell concerts in
the Albert Hall (London) 20 years ago.
As she sang “Home, Sweet Home,” a
musician, who accompanied her said sadly:
“The remains of a great voice.” She is re-
ported to have sung in Wales only the other
day. Sims Reeves retired so often that
people got dizzy, and he wound up by appear-
ing as a septuagenarian in a music-hall.
Bernhardt, Ellen Terry and countless other
stars have left the stage and almost immedi-
ately thought better of it. One of the. in-
finitesimally few who have subsided into
private life and stayed there was Mary
Anderson. She married at the height of
her fame and beauty, and has not been
heard of, in a professional sense, since.
When Lewis Waller got back to London
he made his reappearance in “Monsieur
Beaucaire,” with Miss Evelyn D’Alroy as
Lady Mary. The Madge Titheradge engage-
ment ended when Waller dropped “A Butter-
fly on the Wheel” from his repertoire. One
wonders how the old specialist in romantic
hero characters ever came to mix a modern
society play with “Henry V.” and “Beau-
caire.”
“Private Boxer”: Re first-night speeches
from the stage (B. 31/12/T4). One effort
by the author of “Broadway Jones” and
“Seven Keys to Baldpate” will take some
beating. George Gohan was a youthful
mummer of 20 appearing with the family—
Popper, Mommer and sister Josephine (now
Mrs. Niblo)—in a piece called “April Fool.”
At the fall of the curtain on the opening
night the volatile comedian stepped out and
orated thus: “I am glad you like our play.
My father thanks you, my mother thanks
you, my sister thanks you, and I” — By
that time the house was in convulsions, and
the oraL r thought it best to “dry up.” By
the way, the remarkable young man (he is
still on the right side of 40) is not, as might
be inferred from his surname, a member of
the tribe of Cohen. Cohan’s antecedents
were Irish. Over in Ireland, two or three
generations ago, they spelled it Kohane.
What agonies the ape trainer has to endure
in the sacred cause of Art! A recent Sydney
court case revealed just a little of the pathos
of his life. The defendant was the owner
and trainer of Casey, the educated chim-
panzee which escaped from its devoted
owner’s yard and cuffed the police sergeant
who tried to arrest it. The owner, _ though
he had himself lost an eye in a preliminary
scrimmage, tearfully implored the sergeant
not to shoot the gibbering thing, adding that
it had slept in his bed for months and was
worth £3OOO. His terror could only be
equalled by that of a violinist who saw a
Gerhog about to murder his precious Strad.
“Vic”: The Sydney couple who publicly
wept because a policeman shot their chim-
panzee remind me of Mr. and Mrs. Pagel, in
Melbourne. They bought a baby lion from
the Zoo, and reared it in their house, like a
pet dog. When big, it was caged, and they
could do so much with it that it was their
livelihood. At last, however, there was a
row over the lion, in the household, and the
family party was broken up. The first
elephant seen in Victoria was brought to
Melbourne by two Hindoos, who leased _ it
to Cremorne Gardens; but a dispute with
Coppin led them to take it away, and they
then exhibited it about suburban streets.
There was no Zoo then. The elephant was
stored behind Tilke’s music-hall in Bourke-
street, now Melba Theatre, until there was
an outcry, and that happy family was
smashed too.
“Masetto”: The classic-featured “Czerny”
(A. G. Lumsden) fixed up the greater part
of the book for the “Sinbad” panto. What
branch of business or art hasn’t Czerny
perched on? Fifteen years must have passed
since he first did conjuring under his norn de
plume, and he worked the act through some
long tours. He has dived into press
work, song writing and kindred jobs; also,
he has contested some stiff Parliament seats,
and on one occasion gave Frank Madden
quite a cold sensation by getting within a
dozen votes of him. Lumsden is said to have
two or three plays in his cupboard ready for
action.
Some successful melodramas are seized
for burlesque purposes almost as soon as
they are born. “Drink,” for instance, was
elaborately parodied at one London theatre
whilst it was first booming fit another.
W. G. Anson, the brilliant comedian who is
still dear to middle-aged Australians, was
the dipsomaniac in the “Drink” absurdity,
and the original Fred Leslie, then a very
young man, played the singing villain. “Sil-
ver King” was feebly burlesqued as “Silver
Guilt,” and the Brough-Boucicault Co.
brought it to Australia. Mrs. Brough took
the part of the Spider. But “East Lynne”
escaped travesty for many years. Only lately
has Mrs. Henry Wood’s mawkish story been
comprehensively ridiculed: a four-act “skit”
was worked into a revue at the Ambas-
sadors’ Theatre (London), and the little
Japanese actress, Hanako, appeared as Lady
Isabel, the dreary penitent who returns to
the dear old home in blue. goggles and drops
tears on poor Little Willie. - To think that
the most wept-over heroine of British melo-
drama should have lived to be sport for a
Jap. lady in a Cockney playhouse!
“0.K.”: Amy Castles, in her teens, was a
remarkably lucky girl to get the mainly-
sectarian boost, which her voice was able to
renew in later years. But it strikes me that
her sisters were luckier; for if Amy had
been the youngest instead of the eldest, she
would have been of no use to the family for
boosting purposes.
“Jermyn Street”: London Mail’s mission
in life is to supply the “provinces” and sub-
urbs with floating scandal. The King,
Asquith, Churchill and Kitchener have all
had their turn. Churchill is a confirmed
duellist and Asquith a dipsomaniac. For
over a year past Gladys Cooper—that rare
thing, a musical comedienne who is charming
both “on” and “off” —has been a Mail sub-
ject. It was almost shouted that she was
about to be divorced, with scores of co-
respondents. A visit to the files of the
Supreme Court would have proved that it
was a lie, but everybody was too excited to
go. 'Now she has got £l2OO from the paper;
for putting it too definitely. Or, to be more
accurate, she has got a verdict for that sum.
Died on Monday, at the age of 68, Wil-
liam Rann Kennedy, wrongly called in one
of the dailies a Law Lord, actually one of
the Lords Justices of the Court of Appeal
in London. He served on the High Court
Bench the 15 years which would have
entitled him to a pension of £3500 on retire-
ment, and then moved up to the Court of
Appeal, where he spent seven more years at
£6OOO a year. He was one of the great lawyers
of recent years—ranking with such men as
Pickford and A. T. Lawrence. The general
public was not interested in him, nor he in
it, but lawyers know his judgments well.
The sort of cable that the Australian Free-
trade papers are printing nowadays:—
London, Saturday. —Mr. Albert Spicer, the well-
known Freetrader, seconded a motion which was
adopted by the London Chamber of Commerce, urg-
ing the establishment of aniline dye factories by the
guarantee of adequate tariff protection for at least
a decade after the termination of the war. The
recommendation was on non-party lines, as the
matter is of vital national" importance.
Great Britain gets into its first storm since
the Fr-eetrade fanatics took charge, and not
only has their precious doctrine to go over-
board, but its alleged friends give a guar-
antee that they won’t so much as attempt
to resurrect the corpse for 10 years—by
which time they will be prepared to swear
that they never knew it.
You can’t call the Labor party the Bow-
yang party any longer. In the rush for the
Labor nomination for the Grampians seat
in the Reps, there are a couple of barristers,
one of them belonging to a family of mining
magnates; a managing law-clerk; a mining
investor; a journalist; a couple of farmers
and a grazier or two; a school-teacher; Alf
Lumsden, who has been many things ; and
the general sec. of the Miners’ Association.
Soon there won’t be a “laborer” in the
House except King O’Malley.
The argument between the Defence
Department and the Victorian Public
Works Department about the fitting up of
certain transports has concluded, so pre-
sumably the job will now proceed with less
talk and more caulk. When Pearce gave
the contract to State Minister Hagelthorn’s
department he expected that the preference-
to-unionist policy would be applied to the
job; but when he found that out of one
batch of 27 painters 16 were non-unionists
and two unfinancial unionists, he reckoned
that the policy was being fractured in too
many plates to be seaworthy, so he decided to
give the remainder of the work to a private
firm, which has guaranteed to keep the
policy afloat. The affair may be likened
to a three-cornered game between Pearce and
Hagelthorn and Private Enterprise; and
each won something. Pearce won some-
thing because he upheld his party’s prefer-
ence policy, although in doing so he had to
kick its policy of supporting State Enter-
prise in the neck; Hagelthorn won some-
thing, inasmuch as he upheld his party’s non-
preference policy, although in doing so he
had to kick a profitable job to Gehenna;
and Private Enterprise ' won something,
because it scored the job.
“Kodak”: When the S. M. Herald in-
formed me that some of the Sydney news-
boys made between £lO and £l2 a week, I
re-cast the last chapter of my three-volume
novel, “The Duke of Stifleshire, or Cadge-
crawler Towers.” Here is part of it:
The day was dying and the bleak wind was hiccup-
ing in the chimney like the last inebriated mourner.
The Duke, in sombre mood and with white hands
clasped nervously behind his back, paced up and
down the library between two lines of frowning por-
traits.. He was followed closely by his favorite
hounds, the butler, the first and second footmen, and
a crowd of importunate creditors armed with writs.
It was a wonderful yet terrifying spectacle —to see
the vengeful but cowed masses sweeping after the
proud and defenceless nobleman, whose very aloofness
forbade any direct approach from the front. Up and
down he went attended closely by his enemies, ser-
vants and hounds, and one shuddered to think what
anguish would have been theirs if he had slipped on
one of his own banana-skins and been trampled on by
the whole gathering.
The Duke’s passion for bananas was well known;
he always kept his cellar well stocked, and had a
staff of Chinamen to ripen the new shipments by
sleeping and smoking opium on them. His tail-
pockets bulged with them, and it was his habit when
thinking deeply to take a length of fruit from his
pocket, peel it, throw the skin over his shoulder with
a graceful action and push the rest into his face.
As he walked now he peeled one of the things and
the flying skins slapped the perspiring faces of his
retinue. They did not flinch, but pressed steadily
after him; others, more incautious, tgpd on the
things and fell with dull thuds.
Suddenly the door was flung open and a footman
appeared with a silver salver on which rested a card.
“What is it?” the Duke asked in a harsh voice.
The servant extended the salver' with the card.
The Duke took it up. It was the King of Diamonds 1
The Duke reeled and would have fallen but for the
solid wall of creditors behind him. But, if he noticed
them at all, he gave no sign as he recovered his
balance by pushing the hot face of one whose bill was
marked, “To account rendered —-£79 Bs. sd. A
settlement will oblige.”
“Show him in here,” he commanded.
The servant bowed and retired, and, after a slight
pause, a pleasant, crystalline jingling was heard; it
suggested sleigh bells or an agitated glass chandelier
with a dash of icecream cart. Then the door was
flung open and a young man stepped in hung with
diamonds. He had a bucket of diamonds in either
hand, and behind him was the footman bearing a
large black trunk, on the side of which was painted
in large white letters the one word—DIAMONDS.
While the creditors leant against one another for
support the old Duke gazed horror-stricken at all
this vulgar ostentation. “So!” he thundered. “So,
sir, this is the result of your farming in Canada!”
The young man’s lean, aristocratic face flushed and
his diamonds flashed angrily. “No, father,” he said.
“I have not farmed in Canada! These poor gems
that you see I earned by selling papers in Sydney
before they raised the price from 14 for Bd. to 12 for
Bd. Now, sir, you will be able to pay off all your
debts! You will be able to clear the estate
and”
But the rest of his speech was drowned by the
shouting and trampling of escaping creditors who
saw themselves in imminent danger of being paid in
full and finished with —the most terrible thing that
can happen to an English tradesman.
There was a crash amongst the cinders in the grate
as the Duchess, her face wreathed with smiles and
soot, fell out of the chimney uttering cries of joy.
“Charles! Charles, my dear child 1 I couldn’t wait
to slide down the banisters!”
“Mother!” The diamonds tinkled musically as he
sprang to her assistance. But, quick as he was, his
-father was before him and helped her out of the
ashes with the old-world courtesy for which he was
famous. Then at last mother and son embraced rap-
turously and stood gazing into each other’s eyes. The
Duke, wearing a benign smile, stood by slowly peel-
ing his fifteenth banana since dinner.
“Charles —my dear boy!”
“Mother! So you are still my dear mother!”
“Dearer than ever, Charles!”

SONGS FOB ANCIENT SINNERS.
[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
I am sick of the query: “What are our young men
doing for the Empire?” What, I want to know, are
the old men doing? How many of them are making
sacrifices worth mentioning, monetary or otherwise?
I see that theatrical artists have started singing re-
cruiting songs at youthful males. How about this for
deliverance at elderly importers?
Low Duties.
(The Importers’ Marseillaise .)
We know it will annoy you:
But we think they ought to go.
They’re rotten to the core, that’s manifest.
They help the foreign worker,
The sweater and the shirker,
And though, of course, you think they are the best,
When nations start to break things,
Well, others have to make things,
Or else they’re bound to get it in the vest.
- Chorus :
So jump on the importing trade like blazes,
And please to do the jumping here and now ;
The man whose boots and trousis
Are made in foreign houses
Is no more patriotic than a Cow.
The following is designed for use against the indivi-
dual who objects to compulsory service for adults: —
It’s a Good Way to Help the Empire.
What matter, old man, if your shop is short-handed?
What matter the fact that your customers swear?
When all our vast Empire’s unitedly banded
To hurl back the foe to his lager-stained lair,
What’s anything matter? So let them go gladly,
And threaten them not with the loss of their jobs,
And do not howl: “This strikes at Liberty!” madly,
And do not observe: “It’s Conscription!” with
sobs.
Chorus:
It’s a good way to help the Empire,
It’s a fair thing to do-o-o ;
It’s the best way to biff Von Squarehead
And his swanking legions, to-o-o.
Don’t think about your cheque-book,
Trade will come back when
We have introduced the dashed old Kaiser
To some more Australian men.
This one explains itself: —
Sons of the £.s.d.
They’ve cheered the British Empire in a thousand
pubs and clubs;
They’ve drunk its health with unexampled zest;
They’ve cursed as low pro-Boers, and snakes and
worms and grubs
The crowd that said: “Give Mafficking a rest.”
But when the Empire asked for something more than
beery cries—
In brief, when it said, “Make some sacrifice”—
Their answer was, in tones of rage, diluted by sur-
prise :
“I’ve given fifty quid ! Don’t that suffice ?”
Chorus :
Sons of the £.s.d., all British born.
Waving their glasses, laughing foes to scorn.
The soldier lad may fight like mad,
And give his blood and such ;
But you can’t get cash from the Bank-book Breed;
They know too blanky much.

Writing from Britain, “Londono” tells of
the German’s terrible revenge:—
While this befogged country is still riddled with
Germans, and the Englishman boasts of the effective-
ness of his methods because his Vienna Cafe now
masquerades as the West Central, in Berlin even the
French name “mayonnaise” is banned. It appears on
the menu now as “oleiertunke,” which is to say
oil-egg-sauce.
MONISH SIEAKS.
RACHEL : “I dink I hear a noise in the shop, Ikey."
IKEY: "it's all right, Rachel. It vos only the segurities aggumulaling inderest."
Probably the less that is said now of the
missing Endeavor the better. It w T as a small
craft. It wasn’t a great favorite with
marine experts, for it had a lumpy fashion
of falling from the top of a wave into the
furrow or hole of the sea. It went out into
wild and cold and cheerless waters with no
wireless apparatus—and it has wholly
neglected to come back. When a vessel
which is fitted with wireless neglects to come
back and sends ho report, everybody knows
what has happened, and a vast amount of
money that would otherwise be spent in
research is saved. When it neglects to come
back, yet sends a report, people know when
and where it sank, and where to hunt for
the survivors. So the search is prompt and
economical and efficient, when otherwise it
would be a belated looking-for a prawn in
the haystack of the sea. Incidentally, it is
to be hoped that the vessels which are
reported as keeping a look-out for the
Endeavor are all fitted with wireless. One,
the name of which has been mentioned, is
none too popular itself with hardened
travellers. In fact, there are valiant and
godless bagmen and others who used to speak
of it with disrespect, or even worse.
“W.D.” : The Germans have their stories
of atrocities, too; and this is an instance of
how they start. Shortly after the Devil got
loose I was chatting to a French sentry by a
bridge near Yvetot. I asked him why he
hadn’t got his bayonet. “They’ve taken all
our bayonets to the arms, factory,” he said ;
“they’re doing what ought to be done to
them.” “What’s that?” I asked. “Poisoning
them,” said lie. The sentry was a Norman
peasant and so a member of an extremely
imaginative class. The bayonets were really
taken to be greased—just as one has a gun
greased before taking it through the tropics
or any other damp climate —and the yraissc
militaire on the returned bayonets repre-
sented, in this sentry’s mind, an extra
precaution of his country’s War Office. The
only faint justification for this theory is that
the grease may be more septic than the metal.
In the South African war bullets accounted
for 8000 and bacilli for 14,000. Maybe the
grease on bullets as on bayonets houses
bacilli. But of course that’s not what it is
there for.
According to the untrustworthy cable,
Kitchener, asked when he thought the war
would end, replied that it “would begin in
May.” Simultaneously Rome, which is
untrustworthy too, reports that in the spring
Germany will take control of all operations
on its side of the row, and will make a
supreme effort to pulverise all its enemies.
Furthermore, letters from Italy indicate
that that country, whose operations must
necessarily lie chiefly in the icy Tyrol, will
declare war against Austria —and ipso facto
against Ilogmany “w’hen the snow melts.”
Altogether it does look as though there may
be some unpleasantness in April or May.
By “Henry Horsecollar” :
Among the Indian princes who have made a special
declaration of their resolve to stand by the Empire
to the last, mention appears of the Nawab of Tonk.
India is a strange conglomeration of affairs. Most
of the country is under direct British rule, but some
700,000 square miles are governed by native poten-
tates under British direction. These potentates are
of many races and many degrees of importance, and
the number of guns which are fired in their honor
when they turn up at the Governor-General’s after-
noon-tea is carefully graded. The biggest one
rules over 84,432 square miles, and the
smallest one bosses 161 square miles. The
Nawab of Tonk is an intermediate sort of person
who governs 2553 square miles, and has 303,000
subjects. He is a Pathan, and is reputed to be a
AGRICULTURAL.
CLERGYMAN (at conclusion of marriage ceremony): “ Brethren, we will now. all unite in
singing that appropriate hymn , 'Oh, what will the harvest be.?"
good soldier. There is nothing cronk about the little
State of Tonk, in Rajputana, close up to Ajmere,
and not far from Bhurtpur. If by any impossible
chance the war goes against us, and George V. and
the Nawab of Tonk put up the last fight before the
sun of civilisation sets and the Gerhog comes into
the inheritance of the earth —if they put up that
fight with their backs to the wall of Jaipur and all
the desert in front of them and all their hopes
behind them —the name of the Nawab of Tonk will
go down in history until history comes to an end.

“The Old Soldier”
Henry Lucy has told the S. M. Herald that “of
those German officers who a little more than three
months ago gaily crossed the Belgian frontier on
their way to Paris, 70 per cent, are killed or miss-
ing,” and he suggests that many of them have been
shot in the back by their own men. It is only
another repetition of history if it is so. The brutal
discipline of the old Prussian army in the 18th cen-
tury is notorious ; also, that of the French army at
the same time under its Adjutant-General Martinet,
who punished crimes against military discipline with
mutilation, and has left his name in every European
language. At various times all the armies, of con-
tinental Europe have been disgraced by savage punish-
ments inflicted by those in command, and murderous
reprisals by the rank and file. The British army has
been far freer from this sort of thing than the rest.
Its officers, even when they were handiest with the
cat, would not hang ana shoot as others did. There
is one recorded case of a Prussian dragoon in Frederic
the Great’s army who was thrown from his horse,
whereby his leg was broken. He was instantly tied
up to the triangles and flogged for awkwardness.
There is no parallel to this in British military his-
tory ; on the other hand, there is the case of Governor
Wall, who was convicted and hanged for having had
a sergeant (Armstrong) flogged to death at Cape
Coast Castle. The Indian Mutiny was perhaps the
worst strain ever put on a British community; yet
even then no native was executed who was not proved
to be either mutineer, deserter or murderer of Euro-
peans. I sat on numbers of courts-martial, and the
patience and care with which any defence that was
offered was considered was surprising, remembering
how short-handed we all were. Generali}', by the
way, there was little attempt at a defence. Most
prisoners simply gloried in what they had done, and
followed the example of Tantia Topee, who spat in
the face of the president of the court that tried him.
What may be called the tip direct appears
in a well-known Sydney shipping office these
days. It reads :
NO POSITIONS VACANT.
Applicants for employment should apply to Vic-
toria Barracks.
The boss was so pestered for jobs that he
evolved the notice, which has already secured
some recruits for the A.E.F.
A recent case of suicide-cw/H-attempted
murder at South Melbourne shows that the
eternal triangle is not bound to have any
naughty sides to it. John Allan lodged long
years with Mr. and Mrs. Lawson without
having revealed any serious tendencies to
impropriety. But then the husband died,
and John’s fondness for the widow became
most embarrassing. He pursued her with
offers of marriage even when she was hang-
ing out the washing in the back yard. She
objected that she was too new a widow, any-
how, the funeral being only two months old.
But John was not open to reason. He fol-
lowed her to the cemetery when she was tak-
ing flowers to the late lamented Lawson’s
grave, arid vowed in that sacred spot that
he would sooner marry her than any other
woman though all the others were hung with
diamonds. At last the widow, deciding that
John needed cooling down, threw water over
him in a sisterly spirit. Then John, giving
way to despair, fired two revolver shots at
her (with no results to speak of), and killed
himself. The lodger of 11 years’ standing
who carries on like that is certainly paying
his landlady a great compliment.

Some fragments of the Real Thing—from
the letters of a young Australian with a
British regiment in Belgium :
We have been under canvas for more than
two weeks. We live in the trenches night and day.
The last two mornings I have seen the great coats
of my sentries rimmed over with fr05t....1 am now
dressed in kit nearly all belonging to killed and
wounded brother officers, as their parcels from home
are divided among those that remain. . . .There are
seven dead Germans in front of the trenches this
morning, and I hope to get them in at dusk, to see
if they have any papers on them. “dropped”
one, and is now full of enthusiasm at the thought
of looting something off him, as a souvenir for his
girl at home. I want them moved, because in a
few days they become almost as objectionable dead
as alive... .We lost Major . I can’t imagine
how any of us managed to escape. Of course, this
is all history now, but we want at least 500 dead
Germans to wipe that out, and if they continue
attacking this position we will bag the number before
many days... .One man came to me and said: “Sir,
I’ve been hit and the blood is pouring down my
side, and yet I feel all right.” He had a water-
bottle filled with red wine, and the shot had struck
that. I saw one man struck in an ammunition-
pouch and get blown up.
AND THE MORNING AND THE EVENING WERE
THE 16,325th DAY.
[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
White morning in the mountains dewy sweet,
The nibbling sheep in thymy pastures stray,
The blue smoke from the world about our feet
Creeps through the green of woodlands, and the fleet,
Bale clouds are blown along the sky’s wide way.
At noontide we shall rest us from the heat
Where the tall beechen stems are silver grey ;
And I, with one brown arm about your hair.
Shall blow a reed-song- of our shepherd care.
(Green morning seen through a Venetian blind,
One bath and twenty boarders in a row.
Although a fellow need not really mind
If only Smith were somewhat more inclined
To hurry. Huge and grampus-like and slow
He snorts and splashes at his hairy rind,
Till in unclean despair we turn and go.
Breakfast, a crowded tram ten minutes late,
And noon shall bring the luncheon crush we hate !)
The evening deepens and the warm winds creep
Up from the valleys to our ferny dell.
Above our couch the stars a still watch keep
While the long dark is whitened with our sheep,
And every leaf has some faint tale to tell.
Dear heart, the cloud-kissed mountain is asleep,
The wood folk far below us slumber well,
Only the stream is singing in the night
Its crystal dream-song of a world's delight.
(Chatter of voices, steam of men and beef ;
The hot hours languish and we sit to dine.
The airs are stagnant as a widow’s grief
That, haunted by her parted love-in-chief,
Still heaps perspiring black upon her chine.
Dinner soon ends, thank Heaven 1 But what relief
May close a day as thick with stodge as mine?
The fresh mosquito piping to be fed
Shall wave his sting obscenely round my bed.)

NO MORE FAT PEOPLE.
Most fat people seem to think that the
only way to take off fat is to use dangerous
drugs, follow a starvation diet or take
strenuous exercise. But all this is nonsense,
and, thanks to the recent discovery of an
eminent scientist, thousands of men and
women are taking off several pounds of
useless fat a week by simply rubbing on to
the fat part —hips, arms, chin or abdomen —-
a simple lotion made by pouring a cup of
hot water over a dram of quassia chips; let
it stand for a minute, then strain through a
cloth and add three ounces of Cirola Bark
Extract. Pour the mixture into a bottle and
apply night and morning, rubbing it in with
the hands for about 10 minutes, using a
circular motion, and the fat will almost
seem to melt away before your very eyes.
The ingredients, which are inexpensive, may
be had of any chemist, and the results to he
obtained are really remarkable.*

A Sydney firm of military tailors, trading
under a martial name, and advertising itself
! with battle pictures, has, of all people, just
been convicted of sacking an employee for
j complying with the terms of his military
i service . The peculiarity of the offence
ihas, by the way, been missed by the dailies.
! It is that the guilt of the defendant is assumed.
All the prosecution has to prove is the dis-
-1 nnssal. The firm with the martial title
tailed to show, that this dismissal was un-
jc’aled to military service, and was fined
4-h. Lnder the Act it might have dropped
£IUU. .It says something for Australian
patriotism that the case is the first of its
kind, though several others are pending.

The Public Service Association of N. S.
Wales .is . considering the question of
registering itself as a Trades Union; and,
although the Ass. stands shivering on the
brink, it will probably take the plunge. The
circumstance that is driving it forward is
the tendency of members to drift away to
other organisations in order to gain the
benefit of the Arbitration Act. As it is,
only 4000 of the 12,000 persons eligible are
now members of the P.S.A., and the Ass.
naturally feels that it can’t afford to risk
losing any more, even if it has to shed a little
dignity and come down to the level of a
beastly rnion. But there is no reason why
it shouldn’t set to work to raise the level
of the beastly unions. For instance, having
joined the throng, it might earnestly explain
to its union brethren that go-slow and ca’
canny are no good to a country which has a
big interest bill to pay, besides having to
earn its own current supplies of beer and
other tucker.

“Constant Writer” : This bit from Wilde’s
middle-aged story of “The Canterville Ghost”
seems almost topical:—-
“I don’t think I should like America.”
“I suppose because we have no ruins and no
curiosities,” said Virginia satirically.
“No ruins! No curiosities!” answered the Ghost.
“You have your navy and your manners.”
THE HAPPY MEDIUM.
“Why did you leave your last place!”
“People'd only been married three months—
couldn't stand the canoodling.”
“ Oh, we’ve been married 13 years.”
“Too long. I like peace and quietness.”
THE RETURN OF THE SAINT.
“ Y’d better drop round t-night, Mrs. ’Iggs. Me son’s cornin’ out t-day, and we're givin’
a little evenin’ . ’E ’ad 12 months took off ’is sentence fer good be’avor.”
“My! ’Ow thankful you orter be, ’avin’ such a good son!”
“Gordon G.”: I refuse to forgive the
villain who was guilty of writing the par
(B. 24/12/’l4) alleging that lawyers are
benefiting by the War. He opined that
people now haggle more than ordinarily over
odd fivers and tenners,
and consequently that
litigation is more rife
and lawyers’ purses
more swollen. Also, he
remarked that com-
poundings and compo-
sitions and arrange-
ments and assignments
and insolvencies are
on the increase, and
that Costs is having a
joyous time in conse-
quence. All of which
leads me to observe
that a ton of conjec-
ture is not worth an
ounce of fact. Assum-
ing that litigation is
more rife (which it
isn’t), lawyers, like all
other business men,
have to take less
money for their work,
on the principle that
only a small quantity
of blood can be de-
rived from semi-stony
clients. Debtors-and-
ereditors’ rows are
certainly more fre-
quent ; but that doesn’t
compensate for the
general depression in
all other branches of
the profession. Pro-
perty is not being
bought and sold to the
usual extent; sequitur,
money is not being ad-
vanced to finance pur-
chasers, and that means
a famine in transfers and conveyances and
mortgages, which are all big and profitable
items. Let any layman ask any lawyer “How’s
biz?” and nine times out of 10 the truthful
answer will be bitter.
“Reefer”: Here’s a flower of German
culture plucked close home. One of the
plantations in what Avas German Papua
employed a number of Malayan and
Javanese men and women to roll the cigars
in their factory. There was a long dormitory
for the married folk. The big, high wooden
beds, decked with gaudy patchwork quilts,
were only partitioned off from each other
by their own mosquito nets. I never slept
ia there, but it must have been a diverting
doss-house at times.
Archbishop Wright, of Sydney, has been
on strike. Soon after he arrived from Eng-
land he found that the salaries and allow-
ances of some Australian bishops were
wretched, and he made it known that, as
Primate, he was out to stop sweating. As
some rectors are not strong unionists it was
easy to see that they might simply grasp an
offered bishopric on the old terms and treat
Dr. Wright as if he weren’t wound up to
shoot. The first case, however, has come to
a head. The Anglican diocese of Willochra
(S.A.) was reported to need a bishop, but
the cash value of the job was doubtful.
“Well, then,” said the Archbishop, “my sig-
nature, as Primate, to the documents con-
stituting the bishopric is essential, and that
signature you won’t get until there is an
endowment to provide a bishop with a mini-
mum of £5OO a year and a travelling allow-
ance of £85.” It took some time to get the
employers to realise that they were up
against it. They explained that they could
be trusted to do the fair thing, and so on,
but his Gaiters demanded that the endow-
ment should be posted, and to make sure that
wobbling unionists would not sidle up to
Willochra he, as Primate, declared the shed
“black.” That fetched the employers. They
tumbled up with an endowment of £7OO and
a full travelling allowance, so that as a
unionist organiser Dr. Wright comes out of
his first strike for more pay for bishops
with flying colors.

For a week or so a calm has prevailed in Syd-
ney. No longer has the untidy boy at the street
corner leaped up at the ear of the passer-
by and cried out: “Evenin’ Howl ! Terri-
ble battle in Afghanistan !! Eighteen mil-
lion Jews killed! !!” The trouble began
when the midday or lunch papers decided to
supply 12 copies for Bd. instead of 14. This
was a sort of strike. The loud infants at
the street corner decided to boycott paper
No. 1 and only sell paper No. 2; and, when
paper No. 1 capitulated, it would be‘sold
while No. 2 was boycotted. This was partly
a strike and partly an artful sowing of dis-
sension in the enemy’s camp. But the papers
which cast a gloom over lunch decided that
the boys must sell both organs or neither,
and also laid down certain rules, of doubt-
ful legality, about badges, licenses and the
like. That was partly strike, partly Trust,
partly lock-out, and partly hisrh-handed in-
terference with the liberty of th« subject to
shout when or how he pleases till the police
intervene, and to sell what he pleases. The
boys ceased to sell both papers. That was
plain strike. Then the proprietaries put up
the price to 12 copies for ltd., which was
partly bloated capitalism and partly aggra-
vation. Tiie Bulletin’s idea is that there
should be little kiosks at street corners, and
that in these respectable, aged people should
sell papers, while the vociferous boy who
declares that one 'billion Babylonians have
been butchered in Belgium should learn a
trade. At the same time, it doesn’t want to
be unpleasant to the vociferous boy because
he pushes the sale of this paper, which is
worth a lot more than the price charged for
it. In that respect it stands alone. Every
other publication is worth only half its price.
The earthquake in Italy can be read as a
sign, wonder, portent and straight griffin in
the following ways :
(1) The Kaiser is lot a back-number yet. He has
got his Partner on the job, and the earthquake is a
warning to the Dagoes to keep out of a scrap in
which they might be badly trodden on. (German
view.)
(2) The God of Right punishes Italy for not hav-
ing sooner taken the side of Justice and Humanity.
(View of a devout Belgian.)
(3) The D— reckons it is time to give the centre
of the Roman Catholic world a gentle hint that the
time is ripe. (Strict Orange view.)
(4) An earthquake in the Holy City is sure proof
that the D — and all his legions are still persecuting
the Church, the saints and the faithful. (A sort of
Archbishop Kelly-view.)
(5) The earthquake is due to an earth-tremor of
unusual' severity; it may not recur; on the other
hand, it may. (Scientific explanation.)
* * Mr *
In November Field-Marshal von der Goltz,
chief organiser of the German army and
regarded as the Germaif Kitchener, gave an
interview to the Hamburg Fremdenblatt.
Said he: —
Turkey is this time splendidly arnled, and, most im-
portant of all, Enver Bey is at the head of things.
He is an extraordinary officer, with* amazing offensive
spirit, and the soldiers idolise him.
Early in January Enver got his first chance.
It was at the battle of Sarykamish. He led
his army into a trap and witnessed its anni-
hilation ; then he burst into tears, took the
train home and gave up soldiering for ever.
The Germans may knoiv how to die, but they
are rotten seers.

“Melb” : There’s a lot made of the mighty
work done by the Y.M.C.A. and the churches
in benefiting the soldiers at Broadmeadows
and in Melbourne. Without undervaluing
such “work,” I contend that the National
Government ought to provide for the social
wants of the soldier, instead of giving him
merely a shakedown and a donkey’s breakfast
of straw and assuming that its responsibility
ends there. Just at this moment there is a
jubilation and great ceremonial over a bit
of a tent put up on the Cathedral ground in
Flinders-street. Why should any soldier be
beholden to any religious organisation? This
is making the army a sideshow to the Con-
venticle —to display the great good we are
doing, brethren, and bring money to the
general church schemes. The Government
ought to be a complete father to the soldier,
deprived of his mother —and his wife.

RECIPE for BALD-HEADS.
Well-known Politician Nearly Bald Now’
Has New Growth of Hair.
Tells How He Did It.
A popular politician, well known on account
ot 'us bam ness and his ready wit, surprised
liis friends by appearing with a new growth
of hair. Many of his friends did not know
him and others thought lie had a wig. On
being asked how he did it, he made the
following statement: “I attribute the
growth of my hair to the following
simple recipe, which any lady or gentle-
man can mix at home: To a half-pint
of water add loz. of bay rum, a small box
of Orlex Compound and ioz. of glycerine.
Apply to the scalp two or three times a
week with the finger-tips. It not only pro-
motes the growth of the hair but removes
dandruff, scalp humors, and prevents the hair
from falling out. It darkens streaked, faded
grey hair and makes the hair soft and
glossy. These ingredients can be purchased
at any chemist’s at very little cost, and
mixed at home.”* [7

ABORIGIN-
ALITIES
THE FORGIVING NATURE OF WOMAN.
MAGISTRATE: “And your husband gave you those black eyes also?"
MRS. ODDJOBS (anxious to shield him): “Ho, no, your , Worship. These ’ere black heyes
is consiitoolional-like. They comes an' goes, sir."
“Foe”: After all, it is not the distant
battle that stirs a man’s blood ; real heat is only
generated by the anno.yance that he can see or hear
or smell. As the Old Year was dying to an accom-
paniment of Empire calls and cannon thunder a
Sydney man wrote furiously to his morning paper
about the yelping of the cur next door. “I would
as soon think of scratching my neighbor with a
rusty nail,” he said, “as of tying up a dog in my
back yard to rack his nerves with aimless barking.”
A man like that, on fire with hate and ripe for
murder ought to be told that in some parts of Papua
dogs’ teeth are currency, and that with a bucketful
of them a complete velvety-black Mary Ann may be
purchased outright. Actually he isn’t being kept
awake by a dog at all. It is money that’s yelling at
him to come and collect it.
“Marinoa”: I’ll back Braidwood against
any other town in N. S. Wales for pessimism, rheu-
rnatism, rabbit-ohs and public-houses. (If you read
it over again you’ll see the connection.) Every man
in Braidwood will tell you, with a hollow laugh
that has no mirth in it, that the place has been on
the down-grade since 1870, and that if it wasn t fo.'
the rabbits tliere’d be no Braidwood. The local freez-
ing works have packed close on 21 million rabbits
for export during the past five years, and I estimate
from data collected on the motor-trip from Tarago
that there still remain 21 billions to be dealt with.
A 10 per cent, dividend was paid to shareholders last
year, which shows that bunny isn’t always a cuise.
Old residents, who are nearly as plentiful as the
rabbits, take pleasure in telling you that way back
in ’5B the place was booming—ah, them was the
times! In those days the big squatter hadn't cast
his blight upon the country, and ordinary bushrangers
like you and I had a chance to earn a crust.

“Peter Patch”: “Paddy Melon’s” method
of branding calves in the open by means of his
“twisted greenhide rope fitted to a special surcingle
and all the rest of his paraphernalia, is as out-of-
date as a peace society. Out on the Maranoa they
can show him a point or two. Seldom more than
two stockmen go out together. The catcher seizes
the beast by the tail, overturns the animal, and
squats on its neck while his mate applies the brand.
The operation takes about a minute and a half or
two minutes.
* * * *
“Outcast”: One of the first attempts of
women to emancipate themselves from the thral-
dom of man occurred on the Gira River, Papua, away
back in the misty past, just after the great sorcerer
Peu smote a passage for the river through the hills
with his limestick. The men of a certain village
used to go out hunting all day ; but instead of bring-
ing the pigs back to their wives they gorged them-
selves in the bush, and after dragging themselves
wearily home would explain that their luck was dead-
out, and that the bait had been blown overboard,
and so on. At last a small boy discovered them in
■ the middle of one of their feasts, and gave the show
away. Headed by the Pankhurst lady of the day the
women determined upon revenge. They decided to
clear out! Starting down the Gira in canoes they
were followed by the men, who ran along the banks
pleading to them to come home to Bill Bailey. When
they reached the sea a storm arose, and all the
canoes, being thrown together, formed one big rock,
while the women were emptied out into the waves
and were transformed into little rocks. When the
husbands arrived and could not find their wives they
turned themselves into birds. Even to this day, just
across the boundary of British Papua, on the big rock
Bau, gulls, jack curlews and sooty terns are known
to be the transformed husbands seeking their wives,
though if you were uninitiated you might think they
were merely birds searching for food along the shore.
“Bull Ryan” : We rushed out and left our
beer on the bar. Sounds of a fierce scrap outside
caused the exodus. Whiskery George and Wee Mack
were engaged in mortal combat. A round-armer on
the left ear and Wee Mack measured his length on the
road —sft. 4in. exactly. “It’s no use ’im fightin’ me,”
said Whiskery George. “I can beat any man in
Middigang.. I’ll take on the whole blanky lot o’
yer! Come on now!” Wee Mack was up again
and sparring round. Skilfully evading another corn-
beef rush he somehow left his No. 6 in the way of
Whiskery’s No. 10, and 6ft. 2in. of bushman was
sprawling in the dust. George slowly sat up and a
pained expression was visible through his whiskers,
while a strong odor of rum pervaded the atmosphere.
“Y’ cow,” he said. “Yeh been and broke me mate's
bottle o’ rum, and he'll wop outer me when l
gets back to the camp.” The said mate, Mad Mick,
proved on inquiry to be sft. 2in. We sorrowfully
returned to our beer, thinking hard.
“Vigilans” : Be camel or dromedary-breed-
ing in Australia. Both Afghans and Assyrians
breed them on the tracks. The Assyrians wean
the young beasts early for the sake of the milk,
which they use largely. The Afghans, on the other
hand, do not drink dromedary juice. At birth, the
calves are very helpless, with grotesquely long legs:
but they soon gain strength. As three-year-olds
they are ridden short journeys; in their fifth year
they attain their full stature and vigor. If well
cared for they live to about 30. When travelling,
the young calf is usually slung in a net hung on
the side of an adult. The most peculiar thing
about the camel is the hardness of its mouth, and
on that account the driving gear is rigged through
the nose. No matter how thorny the boughs or
leaves of a tree may be, they are all one to the
dromedary; it is simply marvellous how the animals
are able to eat such fodder without injuring the
mouth." But camels soon break down on an inade-
quate food supply or on a supply which consists
entirely of branches and leaves. The gait of a
riding beast is seven miles an hour. Once on the
track from Euela to Israelite Bay I rode a drom-
edary 100 miles at a jog. I wouldn’t do it again
to save a Mormon missionary from a tribe of
cannibals.
THE “THINGS."
(Or the gentle art of suggestion.)
THE DINER (jocosely): "All things come to him who waits."
THE WAITER : “They do indeed, sir. They give us sixpenny tips."
“Circle”: Mr. and Mrs. Fiesnap, the quiet
theatrical couple who used to do clever little potted
bellowdramas at the halls, disliked pubs., and used
to take a furnished house wherever they happened to
be showing. Years ago they struck Melbourne, and,
as usual, got a furnished house and hired the sleepi-
est female in the city to “general” for them. They
patiently prised her out of bed for the first week;
but it got wearisome, and on the eighth day they
struck and arranged a sort of tragedy instead. The
morning calm was suddenly broken by the explosive
opening of the Piesnaps’ bedroom-door and a medley
of shrieks and bloodthirsty yells of “I’ll kill you!”
Down the stairs fled the couple, Mrs. Piesnap with
hair and nightrobe flying and red grease-paint pouring
from a wound in her arm. Behind her leaped her
husband, flourishing his stage revolver and howling
his murder-promise. They coursed in and out of the
rooms, overturning a few cheap things that didn’t
matter, and making so much noise that they couldn’t
hear what the maid was contributing to the uproar.
Then, having made a stirring demonstration, they
coursed back to their room, slammed the door and
subsided. Half a minute passed, and then the door
of the sleeper's room was heard to open cautiously.
“Wos that th’ milkmun ?” yawned a perfectly calm
voice, still thick with sleep. The great scare had
failed.
* * * *
“Turnips” : England’s famous skylark, the
standby of the spring poet, has been declared a pest
and a noxious animal within the meaning of the Act
made and provided in Victoria. Imported by a well-
meaning enthusiast 50 years ago with the idea that
it would pour forth its liquid notes on the lower
perches of Heaven, so to speak, it has gone on multi-
plying, and now devotes most of its time to agricul-
tural pursuits on earth. By following the Victorian
farmer who has planted cabbages and cauliflowers and
similar crops and uprooting the seedlings, the lark
has so enraged that bucolic person that the official
anathema has gone forth. In some portions of Eng-
land, Australia is known as the country where coarse
persons kill foxes. What will they say in England
when they hear that their skylark is now denounced
as a noxious animal?
“8.T.”: The show was a recent importa-
tion, and was particularly and peculiarly awful. The
two plain men who had come to town to enlist stood
as much of the stuff as they could ; then said Brown:
“This is getting me down.” “It’s got me dizzy
already,” said Smith. “If we stay another ten min-
utes you’ll have me screaming.” “Let’s sneak out,”
said Brown. “Righto,” said Smith. “There's no one
looking. Anyhow, if anyone tries to stop us we can
maim him and plead self-defence.” They stole out,
and fell into the bar next door in almost a fainting
condition. There was a row on. Three youths had
taken exception to the extreme stiffness of the white
shirt of a dapper gentleman in evening dress, and
were thinking of killing him. Smith and Brown in-
tervened and prevented manslaughter. The dapper
gentleman in evening dress was most grateful.
“Here,” he said, “you might take these as some slight
expression of my obligation to you.” He pressed cards
on his saviors and went out. “Who’s he?” asked
Smith. “Manager of the show next door,” said the
barman. The cards were “stiffs” for the entertain-
ment from which Brown and Smith had just fled for
their lives.
THE PATRIOTIC MENU.
COOKADINER: “ What I do this pheliow?
Him British."
KING TUM TUM : “Better send him to the
Patriotic Fund. And cook me a German."
“Jacko” : Be blacks’ camps. On the
N.S.W. North Coast there are, or lately were, two
white women teaching morals ( ?) to the blacks. One
is married to a full-blood ; the other has been turned
down bv two half-castes and a full-bred black as not
being “class” enough. She is, I believe, still in
camp. The Law lays hold of a white man who “goes
black” and shoves him in gaol. Can’t anything be
done when a white woman “goes black” ?
WHILE DIGGING POTATOES AT PORTER’S
RETREAT.
[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
While digging potatoes at Porter’s Retreat,
James McKinnon, son of the postmaster, was bitten
by a snake on the leg. He managed to get home;
and his uncle applied a ligature, cut a piece out,
and applied permanganate of potash and salt. Young
McKinnon is now progressing favorably.
—Country news item.
True, the world is at war; still the people must eat.
So away in the country of silence and sun,
A youth dug potatoes at Porter’s Retreat,
And, compared with the trench-work, you’d reckon
it fun.
As the breeze stroked the grass and he toiled in the
heat,
All was peace and potatoes at Porter’s Retreat.
Did he think of the war as he levered them up
From the sweet-smelling loam where they’d bur-
geoned and bloomed ?
Did he love the potatoes on which he would sup?
Did he hate them and sigh for the cannon that
boomed ?
Ah, whatever his thoughts, sure his labor was sweet
When he dug his potatoes at Porter’s Retreat!
Was he glad to be there in the paddocks of peace ?
Did he fret to be gone with the riflemen brown ?
Did he envy the spuds as he gave them release,
And desire just like them to be railed into town ?
Did he hear in the wind a far drum’s steady beat,
As he dug his potatoes at Porter’s Retreat ?
Never mind what he felt! Do not ask what he
heard !
If he longed to see Death in his blutwurst array,
Then a venomous sausage, obscene and absurd,
Slily crawled like an army behind him that day,
And it struck like Von Kluck from the ground neai
his feet,
As he dug his potatoes at Porter’s Retreat.
Many go to the front and return without scars,
Yet we honor them all as they march up the
street;
But we utter no cheers and we empty no bars
For the wounded spud-digger of Porter’s Retreat.
There is danger all round ; life’s a question of luck ;
And a snake is as bad any day as Von Kluck.

THE HEAVY JEW.
[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
“There was a heavy joo last night,”
The slipshod talker said ;
She cut wet roses with delight
While others lay abed,
And gave the good King's English lip
With many a slur and many a slip.
“There was indeed!” her dad replied.
“I heard him coming down.”
The girl at plucking roses shied
And wore a puzzled frown.
“You heard !” “Oh, yes, my dear !
It's true.
I heard last night’s tremendous .Tew!
“The bookie, Marks, who lives next door,
Won thousands yesterday.
He cabbed home singing songs at four
In quite a joyous way.
I knew when corks and taxis flew
The night had brought a heavy Jew.”

AN INTERESTING
EXPERIMENT.
If you would like to see the alteration Grey Hairs
make, just lay a piece of paper over each of the two
halves of the above portrait. The Grey “half” will
then be seen to have the appearance of 45 years of
age, whereas the other half looks only 30. Dr. B.
Allen’s (U.S.A.) Mexican Walnut Stain will make
all those years of difference if you are grey or prema-
turely grey. It is perfectly harmless, easy to apply,
and will quickly restore the Hair to the natural shade
of youth, or younger years.
Dr. B. ALLEN’S <u.s.ao

“Hamer”: A wedding feast, or beano, or
shake-up which finishes with a violent argument as
to who is boss is not a promising start to any mar-
riage. However, there is this much to be said: the
row didn’t occur between the principals, but' only
between their brothers. It had been arranged that
the brothers of the bride and bridegroom should act
as M’s.C. ; and they evidently took it upon themselves
to decide which half of the new partnership was to
take the reins. Hence, if the bride’s brother
announced a dance, the bridegroom’s relative immedi-
ately proclaimed a song. This naturally led to ill-
feeling, and words, and demands to know who was
boss, and blows, and a broken jaw. The broken jaw
was the gift of tl.e bride’s brother to the brother of
the ’groom, who had been best man at the nuptials
but was only second-best man at the fight. The
trouble led, moreover, to the police-courts, and seems
bound to lead to unhappiness ; for, with her brother
committed for trial on a charge laid by her brother-
in-law, the bride is bound to feel some soreness, while
hubby isn’t likely to feel exactly elated about the
initial triumph of his bride’s forces. It is an un-
happy thing when relatives insist on an attempt to
settle the inevitable struggle for supremacy before
the parties really concerned have even realised that
the struggle is inevitable.
Adelaide Museum has added to its collec-
tion a 25ft. plaster cast of a basking shark, lately
caught on the S. Aus. coast. Director Waite made
colored sketches of the original before it became too
high to approach, and he claims that the cast,
colored accordingly, gives a better idea of life than
any stuffed skin. It is believed that this is the
largest cast of a fish in the world.

“The Emu”: Some more Sydney Tele-
graph :
On Saturday morning, at Broken Hill, a crowd
about 2000 strong attempted to climb the flagstaff of
the German Club, which had been left standing, and
after a few attempts a young man succeeded. Amidst
thunderous cheers he hung out to the breeze the flag
of Australia.
It’s lucky it ended that' way. If the whole 2000 had
managed to climb the pole there would have been no
one left to cheer, and what would have happened to
the Empire then?
A REAL HORROR-DAY.
“ Hello, Jacky! What’s up with old Mick?”
"Mine tinkit him bin havin' a horrorday .”
A CLOSE-SEASON SOLILOQUY.
OLD SPORT: "By jingo! If I only had those teeth and them ducks what a time I
could have! ”
“Wandi”: So much is heard about the
“silent solitudes” of the bush that the inexperienced
would think it had no voices to break the stillness
of night, or to strike a sympathetic chord in the
heart of the wanderer by day. I allow it is a lonely
place where nobody lives, but the wildest regions
are seldom if ever silent. The dry interior most
nearly answers to the description of “silent soli-
tudes” ; yet the interior itself knows only inter-
mittent lapses of silence. There is a peculiar hum,
such as one may hear when standing a few paces
from a beehive; a low, throbbing, palpitating sound;
a continual murmur like the rushing of distant water,
even when there is not a breath of wind stirring.
Certainly, if nothing more than this ceaseless hum
could be heard, one would be excused for calling it
silent. But from the horizon wings the omnipresent
crow; from the dry gullies the black scavenger
sends forth his blatant calls, and where there is
prey he makes the air vibrant with his cries. The
place at first seems more befitting to the eagle—a
bird whose shrill whistling note is not often heard
—than to the crow. But when the chattering and
screeching galahs and corellas sweep over in the
mornings and evenings, one’s preconceptions of a
quiet place are rudely shattered. Besides these noisy
cockatoos and besides cooing doves and forest
pigeons, the inland plains are frequented by those
favorite little parrots, the quarrian, budgerygar,
blue bonnet and bullen bullen, their pleasant notes
cheering alike the backblock dweller and the lonely
traveller. With the exception of the bullen bullen, a
greenish bird with blue and yellow markings,
which obtains much of its food in trees, and is
very partial to wilga berries, all those named are
ground feeders subsisting mainly on grass seeds. In
the real bush, the timbered hills and flats and
scrubby ranges there is absolute silence neither
by day nor by night. A thousand voices break on the
ears from all around, some so pleasant and sweet
that one catches himself listening attentively for
them, while breathing anathemas on the medley
that all but drowns them. Men who have been
horse-hunting, holding their very breath in the effort
to distinguish the tinkling of their bells from the
multitudinous sounds incessantly droning in their
ears, know what that medley is, and how very noisy
the bush can be in its sober moments. Travellers
usually get up before daylight, when there is some
chance of locating their bells before the myriad
life of the bush awakens. If they can discover
where the horses are they go back to the “naps” for
another sleep. At other times they have to walk in
a wide circle round the camp to locate them, know-
ing they will have comparatively little chance of
hearing the bells once the day dawns. Though never
quite silent the hour after midnight and the hour
before dawn are probably the quietest in the bush.
And these are the hours when the drover’s mob
becomes restless, when you hear the dead twigs fall-
ing like stealthy footsteps.
It happened when troops were marching
down to join the transports. He stood on the kerb,
thoughtfully stroking his moustache. “Brave boys!”
ho murmured approvingly. “Brave boys! Good, luck
to ’em!” Then he chuckled confidentially, “If I
was going where they are bound for, I know what I
should have in my kit! I’,d have a white flag, a
bottle of Red Cross whisky and a pair of running-
shoes !”
The Rev. Dr. J. D. Jones, boss of the
British Gongregationalists, who was recently in Aus-
tralia on a flying visit, has been telling the Cockneys
that the champion sheep-shearer of the Common-
wealth is a despised black-man. Jones struck the
aboriginal wonder at Poltallock, which is a station
on the outer suburbs of Adelaide. While watching
the shearing he was astonished at the “marvellous
quickness and skill” of this particular black, and,
making inquiries, ascertained that he was the holder
of the Australian record, with 154 shorn in a single
day. Zimmerle, the Darling Downs barber, who did
336 in a day, is accordingly written off as a myth;
and all the stories of all the tallies from 321 down
to 310 are merely whale-and-Jonali yarns. It was, by
the way, at this suburban station, less than 100
miles from the Adelaide G.P.0., that the weird Jones
saw “emus, pstriches, kangaroos and endless files
of sheep,” and revelled in the “freedom and spacious-
ness” of station life, and realised that the “actual
authentic Australia is to be found in the bush and on
the vast silent plains, where men are taming and
subduing nature with infinite labor.” Actually about
the only bit of real bush the poor fellow struck was
the bushman’s incurable habit of pulling the parson’s
leg.
BILL AND THE BANANAS.
[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
Big Bill came down from Cooringap
To spend his Christmas weeks with me.
He was a large, ungainly chap ;
llis -pants stopped short ’tween hoof and k.
His feet were wonderful to see;
And mooning much in city jambs,
He held up motor-cars and trams.
I went to show old Bill the rounds,
I led him out to see the play ;
And many strange, derisive sounds
And grins and gibes of cows and hay
Assailed us glibly by the way ;
But narked was I to see him fall
On big bananas, skins and all.
This was too much. I said to him:
“Sweet Will, ’tis not considered meet
(I know you do it for a whim)
The tough banana skins to eat.”
He peeled the next. It seemed a treat.
“You’re right,” he told me with a grin—
“ They’re just as good without the skin!”

Unto the winds, and Faith must reign
If this is true ; for then ’tis plain
There really is a better world !

Becomes a place of terrors new,
Full of “Established” churchmen and

To live there, ’midst immortal cant,

Simeon Doyle’s Ram.
[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
[("TV OYLE, a quare, lone man, difinded
1 himself wid a ram,” said Flynn.
“Annother would rear a dog t’ look
afther his belongin’s. Doyle, reared a ram
most pugnacious, a quar’lsome he-sheep wid
a black muzzle like iv O’Hoorigan there
short iv a shave —wan quick off the mar-r-k
V most dext’rous wid his head. The name
iv this onsociable ’n’ disthructif baste was
Ramesus 11., afther a gintleman in Ayjipt,
wan greatly gifted in battle, rist his soul.
Simeon Doyle had shmall taste fer comp’ny,
him bein’ bachelor be habit ’n’ mistlirustful
iv weemin’. But havin’ a broad shweep iv
green hills ’n’ a nate far-rm, t’ say nothin’
iv an inviable reppytation fer financial
shtability, the poor man was a dale sought
after be the sext, till the time when Ramesus
11. was educate ’n’ ar-r-med wid two hor-r-ns
would knock chips off a gaol.
“Afther that, when the Widdy Corcoran
called t’ commiserate wid Doyle consumin' a
wide-shpread rumor relatif to rheumatical
symptims in the back, Ramesus 11. met her
in the front gar-r-den, ’n’ the poor woman
drained fer the moment she was run into be
a mothor-car-r iv thriminjis veelocity. Dish-
coverin’ the misconception, Mistliress Cor-
coran went fer sanctclioory in an, apple-tree
convanyint; but Ramesus butted her off, V
wint on buttin’ till she was rolled in wan
eor-rner, squealin’ vocif-rous, ’n’ fearful iv
death. The widdy sued Doyle fer bodily
damages done be Ramesus; but the law sez:
‘Whereas a dog bein’ permit wan bite, be
these presents a ram is not t’ be held li’bel
fer his fir-rst butt, but afther that, bein’ a
known butter, he butts et his own risk, so
t' spake.’ Ramesus 11. was not influenced
fer good be the judgmint iv the Coort. Re-
butted elderly Miss Cane whin she would
have called on Doyle wid a tin iv soup t’ do
his ar-rm good, him bein’ bit wid a hornet;
’n’ he chased Mistliress Done ’n’ hit her liead-
fir-r-st to a hawthorn hedge, where she shtuck
wan hour, heels up, not flarin’ to appeal fer
assistance above a wliishper be rayson iv the
onseemly attiehude.
“Then Doyle put on Ramesus t’ war-r-n off
them usin’ the thrack ’cross his paddock t’
Pills’ Bridge, ’n’ the rare unpopularity iv
the ram increased ’n’ multiplied. The thrack
’cross Doyle’s land saved a long thramp
round, but yiv maybe thried the butt iv a
young ’n’ vig’rous meriny ram. There kim a
day whin never a wan iv us all cared a bit t’
cross. Doyle’s paddock, ’n’ ha’f the popyla-
tion iv Rafferty’s-road was goin’ wid a crutch
in each hand. There was mamly invintions
fer the killing iv Ramesus 11. Canty fed
him wid wan ’n’ twinty fut iv wall-paper
decorate wid green flowers iv pure arsenic;
but he cared nothin’ for ut. Finney had
him shwally a shmall detonator fer blastin’
rock ; but nothin’ kim iv that ayther. Then
Malone, wid the assistance iv a shmall shlip
iv an artist, put up a practical joke on
Ramesus. Malone had the artist dthraw
the like iv a man on a length iv white paper,
’n’ this he set in a wood frame be the edge
iv the deep quarry holes ’n’ in the mor-r-nin’
the ram dishcovered ut, ’n’ he dthrew off, ’n’
sez he: .Tis a threspasser,’ he sez, ’n’ he
butted at it wid dreadful impetus. Ramesus
fell on the rocks far below. Did ut kill
him? Divil a bit! He was up ’n’ buttin’
again wan hour afther, ’n’ the first man he
tuck to'was Malone.
“ ’Twas et this stage Martin Hagan in-
thervened. Martin was wanst a seller iv
t’bacca ’n’ ceegars, ’n’ had by him an Injin
carved wid an axe frim a red gum log. The
Injin had a shoot iv clothes put on him
wid glue, ’n’ feathers to his hair, ’n’ Hagan
tuck him wan mornin’ early, ’n’ set him up
erect in Doyle’s paddock, ’n’ went home to
his bed. The Injin was buried to the knees,
’n’ rammed tight, ’n’ so Ramesus 11. found
him whin the day come. Ramesus ap-
proached frim the rare, as was his habit, ’n’
sez he : ‘ ’Tis a fine gintleman, ’n’ I’m open-
in’ the day good ’n’ well.’ he sez. ‘l’ll iot
go round in front to disthraet his attintion.
’Twill be an agreeable surprise.’ The ram
never in the coorse iv his busy career got in
a finer lead. He hit the Red Injin fair V
har-r-d ; then buckled up like a wad iv dough
trown agin a wall, ’n’ reciled, failin’ over
himself backwards. Ramesus got up, shakin’
himself, wid a sore crick in his neck. A
solid man,’ sez he. ‘l’ll thry him wid wan
more.’ ’N’ lie dashed in unther the Injin’s
guard.
The Red-gum Injin wore a sad, shweet
slunile, ’n’ niver budged. ‘ ’Tis most un-
usual,’ sez the ram ; ‘but if yeh don’t at
firsht succeed butt in,’ sez he, ’n’ he thried
annother shot, putting his whole hear-r-t
into it. Nothin’ shifted, ’n’ Ramesus II
lost his timper, ’n’ he wint in t’ bustle the
Injin. ’Twas a ding-dong go, I’m tellin’ yeh,
but the t’riffic efforts iv Ramesus to get in
his celebrate’ knock-out punch was all in
vain ; ’n’ the ram ran riotchus. widout sinse
’r dishcrimination at all. Be midday Doyle
kim upon his ram lyin’ he its victim. The
Red Injin was over-turned V greatly dish-
figured, but Ramesus 11. was dead wid the
head butted clane off him. ’Tis said be some
he went on buttin’ wid his neck wan hour,
’n’ it’s thrue maybe. Doyle hadn’t the
hear-r-t t’ train annother ram, ’n’ these days
the people iv Rafferty’s enjoy free access t’
Pills’ Bridge, ’n’ Doyle is married wid the
widdy Corcoran.”

“F.L. J.” discourses about the dead : —-
Joseph C. Dillon, member of the Melbourne City
Council, who died a few days ago, was son of “Bob”
Dillon, who for a generation was a well-known figure
about the Melbourne Law Courts when Stawell, Barry,
Williams (two) and Higinbotham were on the Bench.
Bob was a sheriff’s officer, but wholly unlike the
sheriff’s officers one reads of in novels. Despite his
job, he remained a “good follow.” For a while his
boss, as sheriff, was Colonel Rede; and the Irish
bailiff was as big-hearted and big-minded a man as
even the Colonel could be. If a poor, deserving devil
wanted time Bob always somehow managed to get it,
and sometimes he got advice, too, as to how he’d get
out of the scrape he was in. When Dillon retired
from the sheriff’s office he became landlord of the
Royal Oak Hotel, opposite the Melbourne Town Hall,
and this place became a club for attorneys, attorneys’
clerks and lawyers’ clients, and (he son kept up the
connection.
WHITMORE
CARR, Chairman
of Adelaide Stock
Exchange, and a
prominent sports-
man.
Melbourne City
Council lost “Joe”
Dillon last week.
“Joe” succeeded his
father as the host
of an ancient city
pub, and was presi-
dent of the Licensed
Viet. Association
before his health
failed. In the cant
sense of the term
he was a “sport,”
inasmuch as he was
chairman for some
time of Melbourne’s
principal betting
club, and could play
a better game of
billiards than most
of the members.
Also he helped to
start the Co.-op.
Brewery, which
strengthened his
claim to the title;
for a Joseph who
sold beer both
wholesale and re-
tail couldn’t help
being reckoned a
sporting character.
Old Archibald Currie, the Melbourne ship-
owner, who did well for Australia in opening
up trade with India and the Malay States,
died worth £332,335. A verra calitious man
was old Archibald; and the way he used to
overhaul his .ships’ pantries—the captain’s
with the rest —was probably responsible for
the odd £35 being saved from the waste.
“V.” : The last of the oldest inhabitants of
tlie Northern Territory to go is “Jack” Symes,
who settled in the North 28 years back, and
for many years monopolised its law business.
He was into everything going in the way of
sport, and was noted for his stag hounds
and his after-dinner tales of his Chinese
clients. One Christmas the writer was
shown a room full of goods, comprising
cases of spirits, wine, beer, tea, cigars,
tobacco and many other things, all “eum-
sliaw” from grateful clients —and tributors.
Not unnaturally Symes was a great believer
in colored labor and the tribute system. To
prove his theories he went there in middle
age and lived only 28 years. Ilis friend,
Paul Foelsche, snuffed out at 82, after a
mere 44 years of the devastating climate.
And W. G. Stretton, the numerous Browns,
Cleland and others are liable to die any
minute, after anything from 30 to 50 years
of the same curse.
READY TO PROVE IT.
RECRUITING OFFICER: “Ever done any fight-
ing?”
THE RECRUIT: “If there's anyone in your
bloomin' army, General, as says I even't
I should like to give him my kind regards."
Died, aged 74, Robert Hudson, one of the
founders of the Clyde Engineering Works
and of the big timber firm in Red fern that
bears his name. He commenced work-life as
an apprentice in the joinery trade, and his
first job was on the Great Hall in Sydney
University. Long after, when the Botany
water supply gave out, Hudson, then
an engineer of note, raced a water
famine that threatened Sydney. lie
won easily, and the Prospect dam was the
monument thereof. Public positions had no
attraction for him, although on one occasion
he acted as Ha’s Commissioner to the Chicago
World’s Fair.
In points of resemblance between John
Farrell, who wrote “How He Died,” and
once edited the Sydney Telegraph, and E.
C. Day, lately Inspector-General of N. S.
Wales police, who died last week, there was
one too many. Both of them started off in
serious business life in a brewery; then
though uncommonly successful, both of them
suddenly threw that line overboard, and
broke out in an utterly different place—
Farrell as journalist and Day as policeman.
Farrell reached the editor’s chair of a city
daily in a few years; Day was the youngest
superintendent in the service, which he only
joined in 1883. when he was appointed
Inspector-General. And both died years
before the time looked ripe.
Passed over the Jordan at the age of 84,
Vice-Admiral Nares. He is chiefly remem-
bered because Britain made one attempt to
find the North Pole by means of warships,
and Nares was in command. That was in
1875. Nares got further north than any
previous recorded explorer, but he didn’t
quite arrive. There is serious douut if any-
body has yet quite arrived, for the two
Yankees, Cook and Peary, who both claimed
to have got there, had more discrepancies
in their narratives than any successful ex-
plorer ought to have. Amundsen’s finding
of the South Pole was verified when Scott
discovered his tent and flag and his old
abandoned clothes and his discarded boots
and his empty meat tins on the spot, but
Cook and Peary have always been matters
of suspicion.
The Rev. Howell-Price, who for many
years has talked Paradise and peace at
Kiama, the home of Henry Parkes’s old
ghost, has done his duty to Australia. Four
of his sons are already at the front, and a
fifth is clamoring to get away. If the age-
limit hadn’t debarred the old man he’d have
been off himself.
The proposed statue to C. C. Kingston in
Adelaide is very gradually materialising.
Too long a time after his death was allowed
to elapse before anything was done in the
matter ; the hostility of certain bitter enemies
had time to simmer down, but the enthusiasm
of supporters had time to evaporate, too.
The business has now got so far. however,
that the City corporation has agreed to grant
as a site a corner of the centre of Victoria
Square, opposite the old Queen.
A really brilliant female impersonator has
just got into trouble in Adelaide, after having-
been about the city for some weeks. Even
in the dock he dressed the part and looked
it. Policemen who had been thoroughly
deceived gave evidence. Prisoner’s counsel,
in fact, said a bet that the police could be
taken in for two months was the cause of
the frolic. No immoral intention was
proved, and an amused Bench thought a
£2 15s. penalty would meet the case.
Professor Wallace, who a while ago was
imported from Scotland by Melbourne Uni-
versity to be Professor of English, is among
the recent volunteers for service with his old
regiment,' the Gordon Highlanders. The
brilliant Walter Murdoch, who sat in the
chair for some time before Wallace’s arrival,
won’t be available as a convenient stop-gap
this time; he is in the University of Perth
now.
Died the other day at Fitzroy (Vic.), aged
80, William John Allen, who 65 years ago
helped his father to bite a piece out of the
bush beyond Collingwood. The part is now
Fitzroy. His father, the Rev. John Allen,
was the first secretary of the original City
of Melbourne Gas Co., and was also the first
secretary of the Melbourne Hospital.
Lieutenant-Colonel Alfred Hillary Neale,
Chief Inspector of Schools in South Aus.,
one of the most charming men the Education
Department of that State ever had, died on
January 10, aged 60. A remarkable fatality
has attached to the administrative heads of
the Education Office at Adelaide of late years.
J. A. Hartley and Alfred Williams, succes-
sive directors, and Mr. Whitham.- formerly
of the old triumvirate Board of Directors,
have gone; and now Colonel Neale, who has
often been acting Director. Colonel Neale
was a brother of W. L. Neale, who came into
conflict with the authorities when he was
Director of Education at Hobart. He died
a couple of years ago.
CATTIAL DECIDES NOT TO LEAVE
THE COUNTRY , AFTER ALL.
The Lands is the hoodoo portfolio in N. S.
Wales. It is an amazing thing, but there
isn’t in active politics a single man who has
held the job—except as a stop-gap. Trefle
is dead. Beeby fell out. Nielsen slipped
out. Sammy Moore went out through an
accident. James Ashton got tired and
walked out. E. W. O’Sullivan is dead.
Crick is dead. Hassell left —to go to a rich
uncle or- something. J. 11. Young is dead.
All these have gone through the office in
the past 15 years. Behind that there were
Carruthers, who nowadays merely barks
occasionally in the Council ; Henry Cope-
land, dead ; .T. N. Brunker, dead ; and Ojm
Bill Lyne, dead. As against that lot put
the Attorney-Generals of the same period—
Barton, and G. B. Simpson, and Heydon.
and J. H. Want (dead), and Geo. Reid, and
Wise, and Jim Gannon, and C. G. Wade,
and “Jock” Garland, and W. A. Holman,
and now David Hall.
Died a few days go, at Moruya (N.S.W.),
at the age of 84 years, William Hawdon.
whose father was' the original owner of
Bodalla, made famous by T. S. Mort and
cheese. One of the Hawdons, Joseph, was
the first to take cattle overland from N. S.
Wales to Port Phillip, and the just-dead
William accompanied the same hard case on
various other historical pioneering trips.
DR. ARTHUR ,
M.L.A, of
N.S.W. , in
Jocular mood.
Dead in Adelaide Ross Reid, at 83. He
was one of the first South Australians to
take up River Darling stations, and in the
old days shore a quarter of a million sheep on
Tolarno. The beautiful Rosstrevor estate,
near Adelaide —now a public pleasure-resort
-—was his, and the gossip of the day used to
credit him with having spent £30,000 on
one European trip. Drought and the bank
smashes hit him heavily, and he tried a fresh
deal in South Africa ; but for the last seven
years he had been back among old friends in
Glenelg.
Archie Peake, Premier of South Aus.,
who was 56 on the 15th, was born in London
and was brought to Victoria in infancy. He
schooled himself politically while he was
district council clerk in Narracoorte (S.A.),
and now sits for the district which Adam
Lindsay Gordon and the wealthy squatter
Riddochs used to represent in Parliament.
Clarence Goode, carrying the Labor banner
into this south-east constituency, is en-
deavoring to oust Peake from his old strong-
hold.

Son of our enemy ! Flown and sold!
Ass of the far-flung battle-line,
Before whose feeble hand we hold
The lands for which you arm and pine,
Young man of Boasts, be with us yet,
Lest we regret—lest we regret!
Your tumult and your shouting dies ;
Your captains and your king depart
With booty of our sacrifice —
French treasures, Belgian works of art.
But Youth of Boasts, be with us yet,
Lest we regret—lest we regret!
Far-called, your navies melt away ;
On open cities falls your fire ;
Our ships are waiting for The Day,
And making your poor Dad perspire.
But, Clown of Battle, don’t forget!
We need you yet, we need you yet!
If, drunk with sight of power, we loose
Gay, tongues that have not thee in awe,
Or mock Tirpitz, the Kiel recluse,
Or call poor Dad “the Lord of Jaw”—•
Still, Prince of Fools, be with us yet,
Lest we regret—lest we regret!
For Teuton heart that puts its trust
In heathen risings, it is hard
To find all calculations bust,
And guarding, finds but you to guard !
For you, Comedian of the Sword,
We pity War’s most wretched Lord!
Ah, well!

[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
All festivities on the Kaiser’s 56th birthday
(January 27) have beep forbidden by the Prussian
Government, which recommends that the day shall be
devoted to religious observances.
No fireworks on Wednesday next
Shall splutter in Berlin ;
No kid shall set a sparkling wheel
Revolving on a pin ;
No flaunting flags, no blaze of light!
No other thing shall be
Than sadness, morning, noon and night
In Berlin on the Spfee.
On Kaiser William’s natal day
They’ll pray, pray !
No fountains running Rhenish wine,
No oxen roasted whole ;
No asking Fritz to come and dine
And quaff the flowing bowl ;
'*3 winter games amidst the snow,
No sing-songs round the hearth ;
They reap who sow a crop of woe —•
And then *he aftermath !
On Kaiser William’s natal day
They’ll pray, pray !
And well they might who visioned war
And saw the dream come true !
The dead are dead, they dream no more ;
The living yet shall rue
Their country’s crime. How vain, how vain
Their “Hoch the Kaiser!” now!
The mark of Cain, a bloody stain,
Is printed On his brow.
On Kaiser William’s natal day,
Aye, let ’em pray!

This matter of extra insurance premiums
payable by Australian Expeditionaries is
evidently a good deal misunderstood. There
are all sorts of policies; yet because a man
has been called on to pay an extra pre-
mium on one kind of policy, it is assumed
that that office charges extra on every kind.
The idea is quite wrong. The special charge
is made only on a special policy.
Generally speaking the special policy is
one of two kinds. Either it is taken out
now, because the' man knows he is taking
an extra risk ; or ft was taken out in pre-
cisely the same circumstances 12 or 14
years ago, at the time of the S’African
war. In the first case the extra premium
is undoubtedly justified. The offices have
been chasing people to get them to insure,
and some haven’t done it. If they had, they
could go away now and the extra risk would
be covered without extra payment. Smith
was canvassed for a policy for years, and
he wouldn’t take one. He was all right
then. Suddenly he developed pneumonia.
What sort of mad office would it be that
would then accept Smith’s proposal? An extra
premium to cover the extra war risk on
new policies is equally justifiable. ,
The case of a policy issued at the time of
the S’African or any other old war is differ-
ent. If a man took out a policy just before
the S’African war, and didn’t go to S’Africa
and didn’t think of doing it, and therefore
didn’t have his policy specially endorsed, he
could go to the present war and be covered
without paying an extra premium. But if
he went to the S’African war, and a speci-
ally-endorsed policy was issued to him in
view of the extra risk he was then taking,
some offices have now been charging an
extra premium for the present extra risk
also. This is distinctly unfair to the policy-
holder. He should not be put in any worse
position than any other policy-holder of
12 years’ standing. There are offices which,
recognising this, are not collecting any extra
premium on similar old policies. One of
the chief officers of the Sydney is a gainer
thereby. He had an old policy, taken out
when he was quite a youngster. Under it,
technically, he was liable for an extra pre-
mium when he set out to smash the Emden.
But the claim was waived. And that was
quite right. When an office issues a policy
to a professional soldier, it shouldn’t hit him
with an extra premium when he goes
soldiering.
It is doubtful whether a life office, doing
only life business, ought to issue War Risk
policies at all. That is to say, it is doubtful
whether an office ought to insure anybody
who is just on the point of taking an extra
risk any more than it should issue a policy
to a man who has just gdtte into hospital
with appendicitis. The policy in such a
case is primarily to cover accident; and, in
view of the absence of data, the office which
issues it goes in for gambling rather than
insurance. The proper authority to cover
the risk is the nation: and it is satisfactory
to know that Australia is doing its proper
work by its system of pensions.
The chief lesson taught by the whole
business is to do it now. The young fellow
who insures in peace is covered in war.
The. one who waits till he is on the point of
leaving for the front can’t reasonably com-
plain if, having neglected his opportunities,
he is called on to pay for his imprudence.

The co. was formed in 1884, with a capital
of £27,27G, to carry on business in Dunedin
under the eye of the founder, Mr. Bendix
Hallenstein. The original Hallenstein has
gone; but the family is still represented on
the Board. Nobody who knows what Maori-
land went through from 1889 onwards will ex-
pect that the co. made much progress for the
first 10 or 12 years. A young co. did very
well then if it saved its life. The D.I.C. did
more than that: it steadily widened its con-
nection. Then, in 1905, when it had got
nicely round the corner, a fire wiped out the
premises and stock at Wellington ; and two
or three years later the co. was one of a
dozen sufferers by Christchurch’s biggest
blaze. These disturbances, or rather the first
of them, led to the issue of the preference
capital. The table covers the subsequent
period, and the tale it tells is one of con-
tinuous progress which of late has been so
much more rapid that, though the dividend
has been put up, more profit has been laid by
in the past five years than in the previous
25.
The progress of the co. is in one respect
much more satisfactory than the progress of
the country; for, while the country has been
bloating on borrowed money, this co. has been
actually reducing its liabilities. This view
of the matter is shown hereunder:—
„ „ 1907. 1913. 1914.
,Pref. capital . . £125.000 £125,000 £125,000
Ord. capital .. 105,707 115,849 116,708
Liabilities.. .. 94,388 66,441 66,002

Premises, plant .. 152,26-1 162,765 157,532
Cash, etc; . . .. 215 2,793 2,393
Nearly all the liabilities are described as
sundry creditors,” so probably they are
mostly trade debts. Whatever they are they
are not serious, considering the size and
nature of the business Certainly the sheet
would look still better if the book'debts were
only £40,000 and the other £Ol,OOO was lib-
erated, thus allowing the co. to get the fullest
benefit of trade discounts. A co. catering
for a certain class of country trade must, no
doubt, carry pretty heavy book debts. Still,
1 armer and Co. of Sydney, who carry a
rather bigger stock than the D.I.C. and pro-
bably have a rather larger turnover, had only
£37,470 outstanding on July 31 last. One
has, of course, to allow for the M.L. habit
of borrowing and owing; but even then
£100,996 is a lot of money to he on the books
of a trading co. with a capital of £241,708.
The extraordinary thing is that, having so
much on its books, and owning so much free-
the co. can pull trough with so few
liabilities. It couldn’t do it unless it turned
its stock over quickly. Farmer’s, mentioned
just now, carry stocks of £174,659 and have
book debts of £37,470; the D.1.C., with book
debts of £100.996, carries stocks of onlv
£122,754. 9
As for the future, the steady increase of
the profits is an excellent sign; and since
Maoriland has had downs as well as ups
during the last few years, it is pretty plain
that the co. is making progress apart from
the progress of Maoriland. No doubt it has
been possible to rake off a greater percentage
of profit than usual during the last few years.
But, though local conditions may be tempo-
rarily unfavorable, there is no reason to ex-
pect that good times are past for ever. On the
contrary, foods and (when the war is over)
wool are likely to command excellent prices
for a long while to come; and M.L. will have
a good time in consequence—provided it can
make satisfactory arrangements with Mr.
Cohen.

It is the most profitable winter half-year the
co. has had. The war hasn’t made much dif-
ference to Westralia —less difference, in fact,
than to any other mostly-mining country in
the world. That’s the beauty of gold-mining:
you haven’t to wait for a market till some
mad king shifts his guns away from a smelt-
ing or manufacturing centre. But the fixed
price has its disadvantages as well as its ad-
vantages, and the disadvantages have been
showing up lately. For the old £4 per oz..
or whatever it is, a gold-mining co. can’t get
the old quantity of labor or stores. This in-
crease of costs, which has exactly the same
effect as the cheapening of gold, is affecting
Westralia more and more as the mines are
robbed of their cream. And so far it can’t
be said that agriculture to gradually take
the place of mining has been a success ex-
cept in patches. Westralia has such a tre-
mendous area of dependable rainfall that the
opening-up of prosperous districts is certain
enough ; but it seems unlikely that agricul-
tural development Will do much more than
keep pace with mining shrinkage. It
may not even do that. In any case, the
change over isn’t going to do this co. much
good. You can safely back a mining popu-
lation of 25,000 to put away more brewery
goods in one month than the same number of
cockies would in six.
Swan Brewery shareholders are, however,
scarcely likely to be perturbed by the out-
look. Even if there isn’t now the prospect
of any large and rapid development; if, on
the contrary, Westralia doesn’t ask the
girl to fill ’em up again so often, the co.’s
position is still very cheerful. In the past
three years it has shown £58,096 more net
profit than it has divided. This means that
it could have paid 50 per. cent, more divi-
dends than it has done, and have had be-
tween two and three thousands to spare. A
margin like that allows for a whole lot of
shrinkage. And then there is the security
for the capital to comfort the shareholders.
The liabilities of all kinds total £69.351.
More or less liquid assets, including book
debts and stock, understood to be written
down very hard, total £115,137. In addition
to that and a few leaseholds and furniture
—comparative trifles—the co. has this hold-
ing :
Brewery lands and buildings at cost.. £85,226
Plant and machinery . . . . . . 68^561
Hotel property at cost .. . . .. 268,278
Other properties at cost . . .. . . 1’872
£423,937
The watered capital is only £252,900, in
162,320 shares of 255. and 50.000 pref. shares
of 20s. Properties are in at cost, it will be
noted; and that isn’t generally a good fea-
ture. But less complaint than usual can be
made in this case, because without doubt
some of the earlier purchases are worth far
more than was paid for them. For all (hat,
since some of the revenue comes from the
use of buildings which naturally decay, ,the
replacement of those buildings is a proper
charge against the revenue; and a specific
replacement reserve ought to be built up out
of written-off profits.

V ith customary caution the management
prefers to add about the usual amount to
reserves rather than pay the usual amount to
shareholders. It can’t do both. Still, not so
much is cut off the dividend as to seriously
disturb anybody’s finances. That the bank
has suffered in its visible profits to the extent
ot only about one-eighth is highly satisfac-
tory, seeing that for almost the whole of
the period the very profitable exchange busi-
ness with Europe was almost entirely sus-
pended. Indeed, the fact that, with so much
to depress them, visible profits have sunk so
little suggests that the disclosed profit used
to be whittled down, and the whittlings
dropped into an inner reserve or contingency
fund. No doubt such a fund will have some
bad debts to meet during the present financial
disturbance. Yet we have come through the
most dangerous period with simply remark-
able success. There was no crisis, no panic,
no slaughtering of securities. The banks
were in a position, in spite of a bad year, to
nurse their weaker clients; and Australia’s
resilience can be relied upon to do the rest
—always provided that the European trouble
doesn t end in something that we simply
can t believe to be possible.

suppose that it was just preparing to enter

ous five months of it.

Under the stupid Gas Act passed a couple
of years back this co. is free to do very
much as it likes, while its neighbor on the
other side of the street must present its
accounts in a certain way, which is. on the
whole the right way, and must charge no
more than a certain price for gas, and may
not stuff profits away or practise any other
of the more obvious tricks known to gas
cos. in order to make it appear that the/
are doing only middling, while in fact they
are doing splendidly. As a result, Manly
and its suburbs pay much more for their
gas than any other section of Sydney
although their works are right on the Har-
bor, and the coal can be pitched almost
from the colliers into the furnaces. This
injurious differentiation, as Chidley would
say—or it may be Bruce Smith—can’t be
expected to last; and investors must make
allowances for the inevitable. But this
doesn’t necessarily mean that the dividend
will be cut below 10 p.c., though there is
no sound reason why a young gas co., with
a solid suburban field, should pay 10 p.c It
certainly shouldn’t if it doesn’t sell gas for
much less than the Manly Co. is doing at
present. Its neighbor at North Sydney
has not yet reached the 10 p.c. mark; and
it may pay investors to remember that when
the Manly Co. is brought under the Act its
selling price may be fixed at something that
won’t any more allow of an immediate 10
p.c. than it does in the case of the North
Shore Co.
If the published accounts are to be taken
seriously the 10 p.c. div. shouldn’t be paid
in any case, seeing that for last year it
ate up some of the insignificant reserves.
But, as suggested above, the accounts of
unregulated gas cos. are not always to be
taken seriously. Ostensibly to cover depre-
ciation such cos. may put large sums into
so-called renewals and extensions. If, how-
ever, only enough profit has been written off
to cover actual wear and tear, then the
(hyidends have been grossly extravagant,
hor the rest, this comparison about covers
everything:—

The war has made a mess of that last line
war and drought. The Metropole is a
favorite inter-State and oVer-sea house. For
some time after the beginning of August
inter-State traffic by water shrank to almost
nothing, and over-sea visitors are rare birds
still; so the Metropole had one of its props
knocked from under it. Add the wretched
wheat harvest and the hanging-up of the
wool clip, which between them have led to
the cutting out of many an annual fly-round
in town ; and pile on top of that the compe-
tition of a new house which catches some of
the flying visitors by rail, and you get one
end of the Metropole’s tribulations. The
other end is the same old labor worry. These
big residential pubs have fallen in in a
rather oueer way. There are wages boards
w r ith representatives of the pub-keepers. But
nine-tenths of the pub-keepers of Sydney
don’t worry about any pub labor outside
their bars. As a matter of fact, three-fourths
of them are willing to “spring a few bob”
to people whom they don’t employ in order
to appear before the bar customers as fine,
open-handed fellows. It is ridiculous that
the mere drinking shop and the big residen-
tial pub should be herded together like this,
and that the tail should wag the elephant.
Considering the slump in the second half,
the first half must have been very profitable ;
so the 10 p.c. dividend is paid without calling
on the reserves —which are still fairly sub-
stantial, in spite of a couple of transfers to
capital a while ago. But if in the current
•Y^ 1 ' the profit falls below the necessary
±32,000 nobody need be very much surprised.
L eople no doubt are travelling a bit more
than they did a few months ago; on the
other hand, prices of provisions have been
racing up, and that, besides the direct effect,
adds indirectly to the cost of the labor
which “lives in.” The immediate outlook
isn t therefore very bright. The position,
nevertheless, is very solid. The co. is in
position of owing merely a trifle—
±-d>7o—on trade accounts; while apart
from the freehold (£104,000) and the
machinery and furniture (£15,000), there
are assets, mostly liquid, totalling £31,569.

The capital is £250,000, in £1 shares, half
ordinary and half preference. The sub-
stantial assets as shown above total £207,690,
from which the current liabilities and the
half-year’s dividend have to be deducted.
Further, machinery, and to some extent
stock, depend for their value upon the
maintenance of the business. For breaking-
up purposes you might have to write off 50
p.c. The shares can’t therefore be re-
garded as a gilt-edged investment: the prin-
cipal is not well enough secured. On the
other hand, the profits are very fine, and
for anybody who is in a position to take a
risk the ordinaries are attractive. The
prefs., limited to 6 p.c., are, of course, only
for widows, old gentlemen and people with
a weak heart. They give you nothing to
look forward to; and from them you have
practically nothing to fear.
Shipment of ore from the Iron Knob
(S.A.) to the Broken Hill Prop.’s iron and
steel works at Newcastle has commenced;
and the co. has opened its books to cus-
tomers for its manufactures. S. Australia
is the first to place a good order for steel
rails.
Town Properties, a London co. which for
many years past has tried and failed to make
its fortune out of land and buildings in Perth
and suburbs (W.A.), had a meeting in
London the other dav. The report for the
year ended July last estimated the value of
liquid assets at £38,904, and intimated that
£8515 of debentures had been redeemed
during the period. Land sales effected
during the year aggregated £9203. The
co.’s principal assets now consist of
metropolitan bricks, mortar and vacant
allotments. It also has a few properties on
the goldfields, but they are not worth much,
and the land which it has unbuilt upon there
is worth less. It is, however, impossible to
either confirm or dispute the valuations put
by the co. upon its belongings. '
The Meteor Igniter Ltd. meeting called
in Sydney to consider liquidation decided
against it for good and sufficient reasons.
The £6O callable on each of the 100 shares
(£6000) would have to be divided among
all shares, including the swag held by the
inventor (whose invention has been proved
a failure) ; and so the meeting decided to
leave the thing in suspense until the rope
breaks and the corpse falls from the gallows.
Bovril Australian Estates, Ltd., of which
Oornthwaite Rason, formerly a Westralian
politician, is chairman in London, has
entered into an agreement with Vestey
Brothers by which the latter will treat the
whole of the co.’s output of cattle from the
Victoria Downs station, Northern Territory.
Vestey Bros, will erect meat-works at Dar-
win, and the Commonwealth Government
has undertaken to extend the Pine Creek
railway to the Katherine River, so that the
railhead will be only 60 miles from the
Bovril Co.’s cattle-stations. At the Darwin
works that part of the Bovril cattle which
is suitable for it will be turned into bovril.
The co.’s own experts will supervise this
part of the process. The rest of the meat
will be turned into frozen carcases for ex-
port. The co.’s estates comprise 9,250,000
acres in the Victoria Downs district and
1,000,000 in the Northcote. They owned
116,000 head of cattle in 1913, during which
year the co. paid a divvy of 6 p.c.
Broken Hill Prop, will be able to turn
out 120,000 tons of iron and steel a year
with the plant now nearing completion; and
the scheme provides for a six-fold develop-
ment.
* * * *
General-manager Delprat, of the Broken
Hill Prop., is back. Evidently he didn’t
find anybody in Europe anxious to take their
zinc concentrates off his hands. They are
turning out about 100 tons of metal per
week at their own works at Port Pirie, and
Australia is buying the lot. But they have
no hopes of yet producing spelter in Aus-
tralia at a price at which it can compete
with low-wage stuff; so they are looking
for a market for concentrates in the United
States.
* * *
The Stanthorpe Prop, bucket dredge,
working near Emmaville, on the N.S.W.-Q.
border, started again with the new year, and
good results are reported. It is said that
the Grampians dredge, about seven miles
from the township, is also to have another
trial. Y Water is also starting up again after a
long spell. This should to a large extent
abolish unemployment in the Emmaville
district. The Y is settling down as a com-
fortable bread-and-butter proposition; the
pick of the ground was put through first.
All the same, given a reasonable tin market,
a big extent of payable ground remains, and
there should be no need to feel downhearted
for a long time yet.
* * * *
Vegetable Creek, working with a reduced
staff, is opening up satisfactorily. The main
crosscut from Skinner’s shaft (between
Chandler’s and the Rock shaft) shows a
good width of lead, with values, in the main,
well up to the average. At the date of the
last annual report available reserves were 32
tons, and unavailable 349 tons, with a cash
balance of about £5OOO. Much of the “un-
available” should before long be blocked out.
Strathbogie shaft, on the western end of
the co.’s area, is not sufficiently advanced
to provide any information. A good devel-
opment in that locality would mean much
to the mine, as the distance from Chandler’s
to Strathbogie shaft in a straight line is
15,000 feet. The total unworked length of
lead is over 20,000 feet, in a straight line
from shaft to shaft, and owing to the twists
the lead is probably twice as long. During
four years of life the Rock shaft (now
worked out) yielded 3264 tons tin oxide,
worth £39,705, averaging 7141 b. per foot
driven.
* * * *
The Outcast, which at one time looked
the best of the Ardlethan (N.S.W.) shows
outside the Carpathia, is in the hands of a
small party of five tributors. They are not
starving; but so far they don’t feel justified
in running a horse for the Melbourne Cup.
Nothing much is doing elsewhere —except
that the Crystal has got out a few tons of
ore from the rich shoot and is going to use
it to sweeten a crushing from the big out-
crop. There’s an idea locally that by pulling
together Crystal, Wild Cherry and Car-
pathia may make a bit of a market flutter
presently.
More trouble is looming on the N.S.W. South
Coast coalfield. For three or four months
past the men have worked when they liked
and knocked off when they liked. This
meant so much loss and inconvenience that
the managers are at last getting busy, and
are issuing summonses. Fines of from £3
to £7 were recently inflicted on a number of
wheelers at Clifton, and these important
youngsters now swear they’ll go to gaol
rather than pay up. Well, perhaps a few
weeks in the cells might do them good.
South Coast wheelers certainly need medi-
cine of some kind; they are exasperating
enough to make a saint lose patience.
* * * *
In the first nine months of 1914 N. S.
Wales, which means Broken Hill, exported
283,315 tons of lead concentrates, valued
at £2,525,357, and 345,167 tons of zinc con-
centrates, valued at £977,126. Thus the
local value of the lead concentrates was
just under £9 per ton, whereas the local
value of the zinc concentrates was only
about £2 6s. Bd. per ton. Now, the metals
in the lead concentrates were worth approxi-
mately £l4 155., while the zinc alone in the
zinc concentrates was worth approximately
£ll. That is to say, about £5 15s. is
allowed to cover labor and other exes, and
metal losses in connection with the lead con-
centrates, whereas over £9 is knocked off
the metal value of the zinc concentrates to
pay for the vastly greater amount of labor,
etc., required in producing the metallic
spelter. Plainly, then, since Australia wants
to provide itself with remunerative labor,
the metal which it ought to aim at produc-
ing is zinc (spelter) ; the production of
lead, since that requires less labor, is of
much less importance. Yet, as a matter of
fact, it is the lead concentrates which we
have been handling in Australia, while the
much more important zinc concentrates have
been shipped to provide the Germans with
employment and wealth.

Westralia produced 81,000 oz. less gold in
1914 than in 1913 and 49,6810 z. less than in
1912, whose total was the smallest for many
years. The Ivanhoe fire, the Bullfinch creep
and the Associated Northern’s stoppage at
Ora Banda are blamed chiefly for the past
j ear’s drop; but the extinction of a few
producers and a shrinkage in the grade
of the rest had quite as much to do
with it. Had the Edna May, Queen of the
Hills and one or two other serviceable pro-
perties not come to light the falling off would
have been much greater. The year’s obituaries
included the Associated Northern (Iron Duke
lease), Mountain Queen, Marvel Loch and
Lancefield ; but the last-named was subse-
quently raised from the dead, and efforts are
now being made to keep it alive. Those now
preparing for the Hereafter are the Kalgurli,
Great Fingall and North Kalguri; but several
dividends are likely to be paid to shareholders
in the first-named show before it passes away.

Chaffers (W.A.) was before the Perth
Supreme Court the other day to show cause
why it should not be compulsorily wound-up.
Several local creditors appeared in support of
the petition, but at the request of counsel for
the company and mortgagee (who asked for
time to raise further working capital) they
agreed to stay their hands for a fortnight.
Meantime the mine is shut down, the staff
has left, and the manager has volunteered
for the front.

Upwards of 700,000 tons of firewood were
consumed on the Westralian goldfields during
1914. Of this quantity 483,000 tons were
burnt in and around Kalgoorlie and Boulder,
312,000 tons on the Murchison, 33,500 on
the scattered fields between those two centres,
25,000 at Yilgarn, and the balance in other
auriferous parts of the State. The industry
gave employment to between two and three
thousand men, most of whom were Dagoes.
The mining (underground) timber used up
during the same period was, approximately,
9000 tons.
Great Boulder (W.A.) is having another
go at the Gamble North lode, in the north-
east section. A good deal of money was spent
on this formation in the early days, but as
results obtained from shallow development
were not considered good enough the co. gave
it up. However, the recent discovery of two
makes of ore by the drill at 1300 ft. induced
the management to try again, and so far two
costeens put down have exposed sft. of ore
assaying from lOdwt. to 12dwt. The find may
develop into something, but past experience
in this part of the property has been dis-
couraging.

Queensland gold figures keep shrinking.
For 1913 the yield was 263,3430 z., worth
£1,118,609; for 1914, 248,3950 z., worth
£1,055,114, a decrease of 14,9480 z. Divi-
dends paid during 1914 were less than half
of those for 1913 —£128,414, as compared
with £266,827. Most metals ended the year
badly; but the gold figures for December
showed an increase over those for the same
month of 1913—respectively 24,9640 z. and
22,3960 z. Mount Morgan (98840 z.) and
Charters Towers (79820 z.) were at the
head of the December list, with Gympie
(44660 z.) a good third. There was no
fourth worth mentioning.
General-manager Corbould has been called
to England to tell the directors how Mount
Elliott (Q.) can be made a bright and
shining star again. The chances are that
Corbould will say that the co.’s only hope is
to blossom out as a benevolent ore-buying
and smelting concern, unless it can get hold
of the ore-producers themselves for a mere
trifle. Fortunately the co. is in a solid cash
position. At June 30 last it held nearly
£ISO,OOO, besides about £25,000 net of liquid
assets.
* . * * $
Mount Cuthbert (Q.) will call up its
unpaid Is. per share. This will put the
present shares on a level footing with any
reserve shares that may be issued in compli-
ance with the co.’s agreement with bond hold-
ers, who may convert their debentures into
paid-up shares. Cuthbert has some rich face
prospects to talk about ; but, after all, a
shallow lens of rich ore doesn’t make a
mine. The good things are spread over
three leases, and the development of three
mines simultaneously is expensive. The
parent Mount Cuthbert is idle because it
is wet and rather siliceous at the 350 ft.
level.
* * * *
Last year Gympie crushed 121,100 tons
stone for 52,4850 z. gold. The Scottish Gym-
pie, after spending money very freely on
equipment, is now paying dividends from
stone worth less than 6dwt. per ton. During
the year it crushed 86,800 tons for 25,6970 z.
and paid 44d. per share (£12,875) in divi-
dends. No. 3 Columbia had a good year in
its own little way; it handed out 3s. per
share (£9600). Yet the market price rarely
climbed to 3s. The output was 6202 tons for
54380 z. No. 1 North Columbia crushed 4067
tons for 19440 z.; and although this was
below lOdwt., the co. managed to pay £BOO.
Dividends for the field totalled £23,703 and
calls £33,316. No wonder the local share
market felt poorly.
* * * *
Corella Copper (Q.) has a furnace ready
to blow in, and if the copper market keeps
steady something may be done. Reserves are
estimated at 17,800 tons, containing ISOO
tons of metal. There are also 16.000 tons of
low-grade calcitic ore estimated to contain
480 tons of copper. Equal quantities of the
calcitic and siliceous ore would average
p.c., or (say) 5 p.c. recoverable.
* * * *
According to George Meudell, the Aus-
tralian oil industry, like the war in Europe,
“will begin in May.” He has just formed the
Kingston Oil Wells Co., which has been
granted four oil leases at Kingston (S.A.),
covering 1360 acres, and four oil licenses for
11,440 acres. Three blocks are under offer
to London, and four to oil people in Cali-
fornia. Meudell hopes to have at least four
drilling outfits going at Kingston within
three montl/s. T. J. Whaley has formed the
Ocean Oil Co., mostly in Brisbane, to put
down an oil well near his first bore at the
same place. Another Melbourne group is said
to have juit about completed the sale of five
square miles to a ’Frisco oil crowd.
*- * * *
The S. Aus. Oil Wells Co. has its derrick
up on its ground near Kingston, and, as the
casing is now being landed, it expects to
“spud in” by the end of the month.
■f- * * *
It is quite usual for Mount Morgan’s
blister copper to be worth over £lOO per
ton. The latest 231 tons were valued at
£24,240. Last half-year’s profit (£63,836)
was less than 13 p.c. of the revenue
(£502,352) ; so costs must have taken over
80 p.c. Now, 80 p.c. of the value of a ton
of blister worth £lOO means £80; and costs
amounting to £SO per ton are simply crush-

Being interested in regard to two policies,
I communicated with the Queensland office
of the society, and got this reply : “Members
of the society volunteering for active service
will not be called upon to pay any extra
premium unless their policies bear an en-
dorsement regarding naval or military ser-
vice. As your policies are not so endorsed,
you may engage in active service either in
the Commonwealth or abroad without pre-
judice to the assurance or payment of extra
premium.”

“Mica Street, Broken Hill, 24/1/13.
“For months past I have been pleased to notice
nurses from all parts of Australia expressing in the
press their sentiments regarding your valuable medi-

and keep to it because I love to help the sick. In
earlier life I was ASSOCIATED WITH SOME OF
ADELAIDE S CLEVEREST SURGEONS, and nursed
their patients. Until twelve years ago I was nursing
in S. Austrlaia, but since then I have been nursing
at Broken Hill. I have had lengthy experience and
can endorse every word other nurses have sa-'I about
Clements Tonic. In forty years I have her the care
of hundreds of poor sick people, I hive been a close,
observer of the effect of medicines, and years ago I
was satisfied Clements Tonic had 1.0 equal, and still
hold that opinion.

Uct Of
A WOMAN'S
LETTER
Sydney, January 18. 1915.
My Dear Arini, —
By the Sonoma on Saturday, James Ash-
ton, M.L.C., and his friend Arthur Eedy went
tripping to America with a family party.
Ashton was a director of the Widows’ Fund
when the more progressive Citizens’ Insur-
ance Office swallowed it a few years ago;
and, Eedy being the Citizens’ secretary, the
two were thrown much together, and they
found one another’s company so congenial
that now you can scarcely tear them apart.
After vigorously looking for a Manly Car-
nival from the middle of last week to the
final crowded gasp of Saturday night, one
came to the flat conclusion that, like Mrs.
’Arris, “there ain’t no such pusson.” There
were miles of Chinese lanterns that danced
in the air when the evening breeze whistled
around their paper walls, and the candle
grease melted in the purple night. There
was one procession of grotesque and floral
motors, and it processed frequently. Portion
of the crowd occasionally stumbled on it by
accident, and knew by instinct that it had
a long human tail, of both sexes, in fancy
togs. There were infrequent bands that burst
into loud noises in sudden and unexpected
blasts. But there was no head or conclusion
to anything except the gigantic goggle-eyed
prawns that were piled up in baskets
near the pier-head. There was no
programme to be bought, so far as the general
public knew. Even that usually unfailing
encyclopaedia of local information, the
normal Boy, w r as a hopeless guide. “Don’t
arst me, missus,” he said. “I dunno what
they’re goin’ ter do —they dunno their-
selves!”
The Venetian Carnival was the one clear-
cut event in this Manly effort for the Patri-
otic Funds. As the Corso was more or less
eaten out of its food supply by 5.80 p.m. the
aimless wandering of the crowd —mentioned
as _ touching 80.000 on Saturday—settled
down on the harbor side to wait for the
water display. An illuminated fish darted
across the night, visibly propelled by oars,
An Indian canoe was about the best of the
small water-fry, and it won the white squaw
lady in charge, Miss Wootten, a first prize.
Furious arguments as to the right of a
limited section of the public to squat on the
ground for nothing in front of others who
had paid Is. each for the right to fall off
ricketty canvas chairs, enlivened the carni-
val.
Two or three hundred thousand visitors
must have squeezed their way into the village
during the week. If only £lOOO is the net
profit to the Patriotic Fund it goes to prove
the chaotic management of the affair. Gener-
ally speaking, the crowds spent most of their
time either amid the surf or watching youth
and beauty shoot the breakers. Two things
will stick in the mind of observant persons
who browsed by the seashore: First, the
priceless debt the gilded surfing youth owes
to his tailor for hiding his arms and legs.
Secondly, the beneficent smile of a hugely
stout lady, who sat. day by day, in the shal-
low water, like a female Gibraltar, while the
Pacific Ocean broke helplessly on her broad
back, and her offspring wallowed cheerily in
damp sand.
The Commissioner for Irrigation, Mr. Leslie
Wade, passed out suddenly on the day his
friend, Mr. Trefle. was buried. One of the
most genial and unselfish toilers, the late
Commissioner was easily the most popular
person in the Yanco irrigation area. Yanco
and Burrinjuck were the crown of his long
and useful career in the engineering branches
of the Government service.
It may be mentioned, without indiscretion,
that the arrival of the Rabaul contingent
occurred on Saturday morning, with Colonel
Holmes in charge.
Adrian Knox, K.C., and Mrs. Adrian
bustled hotne the other day. Some places
that they wanted to go to were too busy to
be even moderately civil, and in some others
the guests were being dug out of the ruins
of the hotel after the earthquake, and else-
where the motor-cars and provisions were be-
ing seized, and even where things looked
peaceful the visitor had to cook his own
food because the cook and waiter had gone
shooting.
Geoffrey Elkington, the youthful sport who
owns a sheep-run in Maoriland, has annexed
the charming Ella Young. She was
“Bunt.v” who Pulled the Strings in the play
with the steep Scotch accent. Just now
the M.L. runholder is in this town, and he
hopes to claim “Bunty” permanently in a
few months. Ella Young has been behind
the footlights only about a year. She is
the daughter of an Edinburgh lawyer and
this is nositively her first engagement—ex-
cept as Bunty. The Moffatt Co. is expected
to bounce this way in about a fortnight.
The long and beautiful Roy Potter, who
once took up about 7ft. of Sydney’s space, is
now married and has also gone to the frosty
front. He belongs to the Federal Steamship
folks —Birt, Potter and Co.
The Mooltan brought back a number of
Sydney folks who had flitted to the other
side before the war broke out. Mrs. Denis
Garvan, who used to be Dorothy Owen, re-
turned to her native town in this craft, and
was welcomed on the way by her father,
H. P. Owen, the clever youngish-looking
Master in Equity.
The Edgecliff heiress. Miss Annie Ducker,
who went off with architect Tom Cosh and
his missus on a world tour last autumn,
clipped some of her wanderings short, be-
cause so many countries are suffering just
now from a lack of holy calm and good hotel
accommodation. She stepped off the last in-
coming P. and O. liner and is now camping
at the Australia.
The Pyramids, which are suffering in stony
silence the shrill calls of the bugle, and the
popping of beer corks, are likely to come
once more under the withering notice of
Marie Corelli. This good lady always ob-
jected vociferously to the ordinary tourist’s
habit of munching ham sandwiches beside
Pharaoh’s tomb, and desecrating the 'vicinity
of the Sphinx with lemonade bottles. The
present rush of Society and others to the
Egyptian cemetery selection will possibly
incite the author of “Sorrows of Satan” to
ride round the sandy premises and describe
the sorrows of the late potentates of Mem-
phis. Still, the Society rush shows no sign
of slackening. Marjory Squire, the one-
time Sydney girl who was engaged to Rex
Rabett for a while, is reported to have gone
from England with a chaperon. Mrs. Rabett
packed up for the same address, to have a
look at son Rex. who is flinging out his chest
with the Australian Expedition. She must
he nearly half-way there, weather and other
oddities of travel permitting.
Lord Dicky Nevill sends greetings from
Canada to his Sydney friends. lie bound
them up in photographs of his present quar-
ters, Government House. Ottawa. The place
is a good deal like a very large old-fashioned
police barracks, with a flag fluttering over
the topmost peak of the shingles.
.T. A. Fitzherbert, who had the most
brilliant “pass” from Sydney schools a couple
of years ago, has thrown off his trencher
and left Cambridge for the usual address.
The first four Australians to be mentioned
in despatches will each get a cheque for £25.
The South Australian man, R, B. Clarke,
who made this offer, threatens to hand the
lot to the Patriotic Fund if claimants don’t
turn up. The average Australian doesn’t
consider the reward before he does a dashing
deed. Still, as the Income Tax Department
will admit, cash is a silver lining to any
cloud, and a pearl is none the less welcome
because you only expected an oyster.
Leonard Brown, 8.A., the 1909 Queens-
land Rhodes scholar, who was finishing his
fifth year in medicine, is helping the Admi-
ralty in its healing branch. Brother Bob, a
full-fledged sawbones, has joined the
R.A.M.C. The sporting young men are the
sons of Traffic-Manager Brown, who looks
after those of the railways of the Northern
State which fade out from Townsville into
the copper haze of the Far West.
Do you want a menagerie? If you do,
don’t waste a moment; you’ll most likely
never have such another chance. It isn’t
every year that there’s a bargain counter
on which the giraffe lies down with the
boa constrictor, and the rhinoceros combs the
mane of the lion in a sisterly spirit. William
the Prussian is, of course, responsible: he’s
a convenient sort of sacrificial he-goat, any-
way. Hunters of wild four-legged beasts
in Africa didn’t know what William was up
to, so they have been sending their catches
down to port as usual, only to find out that
Europe is much too busy discussing German
culture to think about such insipid things
as tigers and pythons. Despairing of get-
ting their hauls into Europe, the collectors
yarded a big shipment for Australia, Sydney
being regarded as a handy place from which
they could be shipped to America or Asia,
supposing local buyers couldn’t he found.
As usual the Sydney Zoo was hard up.
and went to the bargain-sale with a very
light purse. Melbourne was much better off.
The Melbourne Zoo owns the freehold of
its big park ; so when there is a chance to
benefit by a windfall it can go to the pawn-
shop and pop its grounds for the necessary
money, if its purse happens to be empty at
the time. For under £lOOO it bought what
most times would cost nearly £3OOO. Syd-
ney, having no uncle whom it can approach
like that, has to let its chances slip. So,
though the remnant of the African haul has
been camping in director Le Souef’s back
yard in Moore Park, probably all he will be
able to capture will be a few monkeys—the
indispensable low r comedians of every zoo.
Some of the escapes are really the most
thrilling features of the embittered front.
F< r instance, a Maorilander, Captain Mel-
ville, who has been invalided back to Eng-
land, was blown through the roof of a farm-
house at. La Bassee by the bursting of a
shell which killed two of his companions
and a number of horses.
( Major Maxwell Bruce, a cousin of Mary
Grant Bruce, the lady who spins such
pleasant Australian yarns for youngsters,
was killed towards the end of the weary old
year. Mary Grant’s husband, George Bruce,
is girding up his cartridge-belt before asking
the German for an explanation.
That long, sun-tanned streak of energy, Sur-
veyor Scrivener has retired from active duty
and goes on the land in the western district
of N. S. Wales. It is his own land, by the
way. During the last few years Surveyor
Scrivener was usually by the screech
of a motor bike and a cloud of dust, as he flew
across the Canberra plains to round up his
understudies in the baby capital city’s theodo-
lite department.
Melba will be in Sydney on January 22,
unless she changes her mind. She has been
staying at Gunning for the wild excitement
(or otherwise! of picnic races. The Voice
owns up that she is too restless to settle
down for more than five minutes or so in
one place. Any statement that appears in
print about our migratory skylark’s move-
ments has therefore to be taken with a
bag of salt. It seems fairly safe to mention
that, at present. Mrs. Melba is thinking of
leaving Australia in March. Why not
another concert here before she goes?
Major Digby, who makes Sydney his home
in time of peace, has been doing all kinds of
useful military jobs. Recently he was sent
to a northern county to arrest, if possible, a
hostile spy (all spies are hostile) who was
suspected of being very useful to the Father-
land. His instructions were to use his own
judgment, even to the last desperate remedy
of shooting the salary and the German
sausage of the suspect, rather than let him
escape. Just here, however, the weird in-
tricacy of the English law stepped in. It
says, in effect, that while a suspicioned per-
son’s house and belongings can be rigor-
ously searched, the cause of the trouble, need
not so much as have the back of his collar
inspected to see if his name is Smith or
Hohenzollern. In this instance the spy’s
inner knowledge was too good, and nothing
was found that incriminated him or his
family. What they might carry inside their
attire the Law protected. So the search
party had to withdraw. That night the
enemy family vanished, and tin' house was
left locked up and deserted, while circum-
stantial evidence went black in the face at
their escape.
For the heartening up of golfers who are
considering a jaunt to the Kosciusko carni-
val, the remark is here made that the
greens are in first-rate condition. After
shaking off the winter snow, the fairways
are the color of emerald, as the result of
last year’s re-sowing of English grasses.
The competition opens on January 25. with
a men’s 18-hole bogey handicap. Tennis
and croquet events will be sandwiched into
the goff happenings.
Solicitor Theo Mich ell, Mr. Hugh Wor-
mald and Mr. C. 11. Crossman are going to
petrol up to Kosciusko for the golf cam-
paign this month. Dr. Jock Morton, who is
a keen player on the Rose Bay links, and
his friend, Dr. Mills, also contemnlate a
journey to the same frost-bitten heights,
where the polar bear hibernates in the gum-
tree and the iceberg lightly turns to thoughts
of thaw.
A son of Mr. Hanson, of the Llanson and
Lawrence electrical people, may be able
to have a game of football in seasonable
weather. He is reported well, but apparently
interned at Ruhleben.
The medical profession is taking as much
fresh air as its patients will permit during
the present month. The golfing section is
herding at Kosciusko. Dr. Roland Pope is
going to motor up with Pastoralist J. 11.
Bettington and his sons. Bettington is the
enthusiast w r ho keeps links on his own sheep
walk.
Engineer Howarth, who is usually in
charge of the N.S.W. Government dredging
department—no I don't mean the Income
Tax office —is still in England on leave.
Sydney artist Ruby Winekler is in Bos-
ton, where the big publishing firm of Ginne
and Co. has just issued a new edition of
the “Arabian Nights,” illustrated with 46
of her clever drawings. She had great luck
to strike work in which her peculiar talents
could be so congenially employed. The
Sydney girl, who was something of an in-
valid in her teens, spent hours that stronger
uamsels devote to outdoor sports, propped
up on a sofa, practising her fine, web-like
strokes. Since she reached Boston in 1013,
under the proud parental wing. Ruby has
developed, by virtue of medical treatment,
into a tall, bonny young woman.
Captain Hancock Steele, who died sud-
denly at Wahroonga last week, had been 13
years on the John Williams, and previously
held a commission on 11.M.5. Dart. He was
only 38 when he returned from his last
voyage, on the 31st December, and wanted
to get back to the Navy, but malaria put in
the last word. Palmerston said once that
when he wanted a reliable all-round man
for an important job abroad he sent for a
captain of the Navy. Steele was that kind
of man. A first-class navigator, he knew
the Pacific, and had charted many reefs and
islets for the Admiralty. He doctored his
own crew, established and worked a wireless
plant, and was a very fair carpenter and
electrician. lie was well acquainted with
the customs and traditions of many of the
island tribes, and had an eye for character
and a sense of humor.
Manly is thick with surfers, though the
heart of the seaside landlady thumps with
chastened joy owing to the uppishness of
the breakfast chop. The Les Willsallens,
who had their continental scamper hit in
the middle, are sheltering on the sea-front.
So are squatter Francis Bacon and his wife,
Mrs. and Miss Meagher (of Forbes), the
yellow-tressed Mrs. C. Waters and her
hubby. Mrs. Hugh Gordon (Inverell), the
Fred. McMasters and their two youngsters.
Dr. and Mrs. McMurray (she is the large
lady whose frocks rouse fierce spasms of
envy in women who only clothe themselves),
Mr. Pockley (a Queensland man), the Nettle-
tons and Brooks’s (or should it be Brooks
or Brookses ?) of Wahroonga, and the Fred
Smiths, who hail from the velvet lawns of
Darling Point.
Mr. Charlie Regan, a Tamworth business
man, has gone to Adelaide to see what is
doing thereabouts. His eldest daughter flits
off with other birds to summer in Hobart.
Does anyone remember the able-bodied
Mrs. Martel, who was always determined to
recite something or other? She is still re-
citing, or was when the December mails left
London. But she has descended from the
political ran-dan, and now elocutes on the
glories of recruiting. Cornwall had the
privilege of hearing some of these orations
in the intervals of hauling in its fishing nets.
The W. F. Buchanans, of Mosman, are
hiding from the gloom of London at Brigh-
ton, where daughter Lurlie is peering into
her school-books.
Mrs. John Brimacombe, wife of the Yass
lawyer, has been introducing the Manly
surf to her intelligent infant. Mrs. John,
who use:! to be Miss Serutton, of Wah-
roonga, puts in a few days in the parental
nest before packing up for the town which
is approached in an ancient bone-shaking
steam tram.
Miss Brace, who farmed land for a while
in the Glen 1 lines district, writes from Eng->
land of the generally dolorous condition of
life in the agricultural areas. Hodge, the
laborer, and Giles, the hedger and ditcher-
have torn off their smocks to go to the
war, and nearly every country house around
which the Ilodge-Giles landlord used to
chase the elusive fox is in mourning for its
sons. “I am staying with friends near Lon-
don, and almost regret that 1 came home,
for most of my little circle of friends are
either losing half their relatives at the war,
or have been killed themselves. Everyone
here admires Australia tremendously, not
only for the way her sons have volunteered
for the front, but for the fine organising
powers she shows in her numerous war
funds.” Miss Brace adds that the
land is still “over-run with German spie£,
both men and women. We quite expect
many enemy raids, or attempts: all street
lamps are shaded at night, and trains run
with their blinds d0wn....1 must own I
love Australia, and don’t think I shall long
be happy away from its glorious sunshine.
The weather here is one grey pall.”
The E. D. Townsends booked their return
bunks on the Orsova. This craft was timed
to leave London on January 15. They’ve
rushed round Caledonia stern and wild
with its haggis on a thousand hills, and had
a look at Erin’s blarney-stone and all the
potheen thereof, before finishing up in York-
shire.
Bob Neild, a local baritone who has been
doing reasonably well on the other side for
the last five years, has recently gone into
the music-hall sketch business with Marie
Studholme. Not that the vaudeville treasury
bulges much more than the theatrical, or
the still harder-hit concert manager’s, in
London. The war has knocked a large hole
in the British amusement columns. Most
music-hall artists are working for a per-
centage on the profits, and the profits can
often be covered by an egg cup. A Sydney
girl who went to England with a voice
writes: “I have been offered 255. a week to
sing in the chorus at . My board
costs 305., so I’m considering the proposal
unfavorably.” The trouble is that the board
will cost 30s. whether she considers it favor-
ably or unfavorably.
The Sydney correspondent of a London
theatrical journal has flung a few cheap
gibes at the much-harassed N.S.W. Govern-
ment on the score of its “disloyalty.” He
remarks that “in the ponderous totals of
National Funds we see not one penny from
a Labor Minister or any Labor member of
Parliament.” If the alleged journalist who
sends this drivel to the Era will look up
back files of patriotic lists, he’ll find quite a
number of Labor guineas in the hat.
Yours affectionately,
VANDOKIAN.

MELBOURNE CHATTER
Mei/boukne, January 18, 1915.
My Dear Arini, —
The Munro Fergusons gave an impromptu
or telephone party on Saturday. It origi-
nated with that Y.W.C.A. Convention at
Upwey i Upwey is a little place in the Hills)
which the two Governors’ ladies attended
the other day. All the Conventional were
asked and likewise a number of other de-
serving people.
Lady Helen met her guests on the front
lawn, regardless of the sizzling heat, like
the dauntless Daughter of Empire that she
is, and then steered them round to the
rather less tropical back door. The back
door opens on to the shadiest, lawn and the
rose garden. Also it has a porch and some
small, cool sitting-rooms near by. Most of
the party kept to the lawns, but some got
lost in the. corridors. One batch drifted in-
quiringly into the doorway of Governor-
General Ferguson's most private writing
den. The Gee-Gee had just arrived fur-
tively, like a thief by afternoon, in a motor-
car, and was hiding from the manifold de-
lights of his wife’s festivity. He had flung
oft his helmet and was mopping his brow,
the heat being pairfectly awfu’, ye ken, when
lie gasped to see six white-frocked wowsers
nervously gaping at him from the doorway.
An aide lured them from the presence; and
simultaneously there might have been heard
a sound as of aerated water connecting with
ice.
Lady Stanley was a cool, lovely circum-
stance with a Miss Muffit muslin cap and
a blue misty voile dress. Lady Helen
was draped in petunia like a bougainvillea
creeper. Mrs. P. H. Pearce, who is Presi-
dent. of the Convention, looked large and
dignified in black, and Mrs. Howard Berry
was a perfect iced-peach in fawn-color, with
droopy white feathers in her hat.
Miss Snelson, an energetic woman with a
business-like blue gossamer tied round her
hat, engineered the Y.W.C.A. members
through their paces. Their strong suits
seemed to me to be giggling and successful
juggling with tea and ices. Relays of food
had to be hurriedly ordered in for late
comers, and after each replenishment the
tables looked as if a plague of locusts had
been over them.
A pageant and pantomime occurred after-
wards with the lawn for a stage and the
circular rose-walk for a background. The
actresses were , the star pupils of the Audi-
torium open-air gymnasium, and the leg-
development of the girls did the gym. credit.
They wore knee-length skirts and each re-
presented a country mixed up in the pre-
sent war. The wordless pantomime was a
sort of resume of the war from the beginning,
and was tremendously effective on the big
stage.
The audience sat in a large semi-circle
under the trees. Lady Stanley carried out
her own chair by the leg (the dearth of
aides is shocking, my dear), and Lady
Helen managed to find lawn seats for most
of. her friends. Heated and worried footmen
Iried to carry chairs and act as scene-shifters
at the same time. There were treaty-tables
to place and flags to dump at corners, so
you can imagine the distracted condition of
mind of the unhappy serving-men who are
not used to brain-work of a trying order.
The pageant was so splendid that Di Gilio
and his band stopped playing, and rushed
‘ rom the terrace to the rose-garden theatre,
leaving ’cellos and bass fiddles to lie down
like lions , with the grass-roller and other
lambs. Miss Murray was stage director.
. And, finally, the visitors were shown the
pictures, and one of the little sitting-rooms
had a wonderful collection of miniatures—
mostly family portraits. There was a por-
trait of Nelson among them, and in a minia-
ture frame a bit of leather labelled “piece of
Nelson’s hat.” I fancy the hat was torn off
the great seaman in a row. Anyhow, in the
same frame was a small bunch of hair tied
tightly together and inscribed “Nelson’s
hair.” In conjunction* the two fragments
looked distinctly significant.
By the. way, a guard at the gate presented
every visitor with a small envelope. “To put
in Red Cross collection” was the curt advice.
The number that didn’t get into the collec-
tion surprised me. There were small and
empty envelopes all over the lawn by the
time the party dispersed.
Ratu Ivadavu, of Fiji, whose biography I
supplied you with last week, was a great
music-lover. He heard Melba sing while be
was in Melbourne, and unhesitatingly pro-
nounced her to be It. In fact, in tlie ver-
nacular of his. country, he averred that slie
was the Dizzy Limit. He offered her the
freedom of Ban and innumerable presents!
The only thing she took was a weird neck-;
lace made of sharks’ teeth. Ivadavu men
tioned. as he presented it to her. that its
acceptance involved a Treatv. One greaC
chief gave it to another great chief on the
understanding that if war happened the
receiver could he called out to help. Melba,
to whom “scraps of paper” are sacred, has
kept a boomerang'ready at Coombe Cottage
ever since.
t Mrs. Cowper, who is a sister of Dr.
Nyulasy, continues to honeymoon far, far
from safe Australia. She and her husband
are at the Langham Hotel, which is a large
and rather gloomy London establishment,
situated about a gunshot from Oxford-circus.
Freda, • daughter of Colonel and Mrs.
Burston, is engaged to marry John 11. Mur-
ray, of Bri Bri, Glenthompson. His father
is named William Murray, and abides in the
ai-one-time festive locality of St. John’s
Wood-road, London.
Mrs. Alfred Deakin is going to the Panama
Exposition, not merely as her husband’s
wife, but as an accredited representative of
Australia at the huge Women’s Conference
which is to sit during the Big Show:.
‘‘Billy” Schutt (who sounds German, but
isn’t) lias taken his wife for a holiday to
California.. The lady’s mother died about a
month ago, and the idea is that new scenes
may cheer her up.
Ambrose Patterson is chucking Art for
Art’s sake —or even Art for a living. The
war is to blame. The picture market being
dead and money as much a necessity as ever,
he has turned to photography and journal-
ism. Patterson had a record , bit of bad
luck, by the way. He prepared for eight
months for his Adelaide show. The opening
day was August 4. August 4 happened to
be the most prominent day in modern history.
The show was a frost.
What a lot of unnecessary things are said
in this life, my dear Yarrie. I sec that a
number of German women (the worst
frumps, you may depend!) have started a
movement to boycott the Paris hat for ever.
Rubbish ! We all know that German women
never wore Paris hats; that, anyhow, at
present they can’t get them; and that pre-
sently they won’t be able to afford them.
Really, my dear, if many more stupid things
like this are said, I will contrive somehow
to break into Germany and show them what
can be done with a British umbrella in the
hands of a Girl of the Bulldog Breed.
From my Adelaide correspondent:—
The week’s sensation lias been provided by a
French youth, who successfully posed as a woman for
a bet. The town is full of lies about the supposed
victims of his charms. Almost everybody whom one
knows to be elderly and respectable is said to have
succumbed. The most convincing disproof is the fact
that the police ultimately found the masquerader out.
The man that can’t deceive, a policeman is indeed
hopeless.
the Maloja removed Dr. and Mrs. Brummitt, who
are bound for Colombo ; and Eric Murray, of Mount
Crawford, who is bound for King Edward’s Horse and
the war. A few South Australians have come over
from the Broadmeadows camp for a farewell, in-
cluding Major lievnell, one of the Butlers, and a
son of Dr. Yeatman, from Auburn ; and the Colonel
Deans have been over to Melbourne to say good-bye
to their son there. Their daughter, Mrs. Duncaiv
Hughes, and her husband are with them.
Ross Reid, who died on Sunday, first took up
pastoral country on a big scale near Menindie. It
had a 30-mile frontage to the river, and extended
back as far as Bulla Bullen Lake —about 50 miles.
In one season a quarter of a million sheep belonging'
to this principality were put through the shearing-
shed. Mrs. Ross Reid is in England, but two of her
daughters—Mrs. Eversley Thomas and Mrs. W. F.
Driscoll are in Adelaide. Another old identity who
died during the week wqs Mrs. Everard, widow of
the late Mr. C. J. Everard, who came to the State
in ’36. Brother William Everard was once Commis-
sioner of Crown Lands and Minister of Education.
Margaret, only daughter of Mr. Herbert Hughes,
of Boovoolie Station, near Gladstone, is—barring
accidents—to marry Roy, the eldest son of the W. L.
Davidsons.
K. L. Duffield, second spn of the Walter Duffields,
of Glenelg, has a coiiimission in the Royal North
Devon Hussars.
Ex-Minister F. W. Young; leaves towards the end
of this month to take up liis duties, as Agent-General
in London. Still on the morning side of 40, he will
be a young man four or five years hence when he
comes back and seeks to re-enter State polities. Pas-
toral property, a lucrative legal business and mar-
riage to the eldest daughter of the late John Darling
have made him a very wealthy man.
News comes by cable of the marriage at
C airo of Rex Rabbett, a Major in the first
Expeditionary Force, to an English girl
named Squiers. Another example of the
horrors or war! Our eligible young men
leave us and are immediately commandeered
by British maidens. Major Rex was very
well known in Melbourne, and so was hi’s
brother Bobby, who has just got.-a commis-
sion in a British Horse Artillery Regiment.
Rex, who is slight and smallish and dark
and as . good looking as a military beauty-
actor, had some sort of romance before. The
girl was coming out to Australia to marry
him. On the way she met and fell in love
with another. She wedded the new man
leaving his predecessor lamenting. He didn’t
Lament for long, apparently. The exasperat-
ing wretches never do.
Clever Katherine Prichard, who used to
attend to the evening Herald’s women’s
page, and who staged a playlet of her own
in Melbourne* a while back, is now playing
ministering angel at Lady Dudley’s Aus-
tralian Hospital in France.
Betty Paterson, daughter of Hugh, the
artist, has won the single-subject medal of
the Conservatoire of Music. She not only
sings but plays the violin, and there is an
impression abroad that she is threatened
with a Career. Her sister Esther is an
artist in the same sense as her dad and her
uncle John Ford P.
One of the Gillespie girls has just been
married in Colombo. I don’t know the
man’s name or what lie is or what she sh‘w
in him or where he went to school or whether
he is an Anglican, a Baptist or a Plymouth
liock. Only that he is an Anglo-Indian, and
has left for the war.
A Melbourne boy on the Flagship was one
of the. night-guard that looked after the
Kaiser’s relative who was captured on the
Emden. He —the Prince—snores. Yes, my
dear, absolutely snores like any wharf-
lumper. By the way, another princeling
who was here some years ago incognito (he
was a son of the old Duke of Braganza)
used to sniff. In fact, he was the most per-
sistent sniffer I ever met.
Vi Weatherly, the heiress of Billilla, has
presented a motor-ambulance to the military
authorities. One of the sporting Reid girls
of Balwyn has followed suit; also another
Manifold (a brother of the one I told you
of last week), and likewise Edmund Millar.
Meanwhile there are lots more vehicles of
the sort required, and a number of wealthy
people who haven’t donated as much as a
wheel.
Edward Dyson has carried out his
recently-expressed threat of getting married,
and is now honeymooning in Sydney. Ted
did not don white gloves and a frock coat
for the occasion, nor were there bridesmaids,
pages, tasteful decorations, the Wedding
March, photographers and other unnecessary
adjuncts. It was, in fact, a quiet but pretty
wedding,.;-,the prettiuess being supplied by
the bride, who neglected to hide the light of
her smile beneath a bushel of lace, or to
burden herself with a load of superfluous
vegetables. The said bride was, of course,
Dorothy Boyes, the fair-haired, blue-eyed,
»St. Kilda angel who composed the music of
the war chant, “Billy Khaki,” the words
whereof were by Edward.
Melba leaves for London in March. She
is paying visits on the N. S. Wales side of
the Riverina, previous to staying with Mrs.
T. 11. Kelly for a while at the Pacific Hotel,
Manly.
The Mount Sehank Clarkes, who startled
Melbourne with their numerousness no less
than with their magnificence, at Cup time
before last, are in London. They have been
trying to get back to Melbourne, but they
all want to travel together, and it is difficult
to find a boat capable of the strain. The
girls own a private maid apiece, and as to
their mother —well, she probably runs to a
suite. When they left here last their father
took one bunch round by the Japan-Siberia
route, while the other section went with
their mother by the Bed Sea. I don’t know
for certain whether their idea was to avoid
embarrassing any one steamship co. by over-
taxing its accommodation, or whether they
wished to sidestep the creation of jealousy
in the mercantile marine by not plumping
invidiously for any one line. A little of
both possibly.
News comes of Willy Lawson, the affluent
young man who has been dead to us for so
long. He is reported—by a thoroughly rotten
authority, I don’t mind telling you—to have
enlisted in the French army. Not visited
it in a specially-heated and provisioned
Limousine car, accompanied by a valet and a
chef, but enlisted in it. For years now he
has been living in Paris. It has made him
more Parisian than the boulevardiers. He
had taken, latterly, to a moustache and dia-
mond rings, also bracelets. And now he has
put all such frivolities behind him and has
gone into the ranks, where the pay is about
a farthing per diem, and the food dreadful.
One who lias had a chance to observe the
Prussian officer in captivity tells me that
liis contempt for his men is boundless, lie
would rather herd, seemingly, with animals
than with them. And he makes not the
slightest effort to conceal liis feelings. It
is this sort of thing which explains the brisk
fire of hatred which rages in the German
ranks, by all accounts, against the officers,
and more especially the younger ones who
are the more offensively arrogant. The
officers who are friendliest with their men
are the French. There is literally no class
distinction at all between the man in the
ranks and his. superior officer. The whole
French system has aimed to achieve this for
years. An officer may, in private life, be a
grocery the private who holds his horse mav
be the son of a nobleman. It Ims its embar-
rassments in the piping times of peace, but
it is a great system when war comes. Aus-
tralia has unconsciously got something
resembling it. Plenty of young men from all
the States are in the ranks who this time
last year were regarded as acquisitions to
any party. Their officers are often earnest
soldiering youth whom our haughty party-
givers have never heard of.
Melba and the -George Armstrongs have
been pervading the Goulburn district of
N. S._ Wales for the last few days. Goul-
burn is en fete; not because Melba is there,
but because this year is the 50th (or it may
be the 500th) anniversary of the Tirranna
race meeting. Goulburn wakes up witli the
advent of Tirranna. Old residents say it
never looks more truly Parisian than on
these occasions. The entire neighborhood
dashes out to the wind-swept and somewhat
dusty downs near the town. There is fierce
racing and fiercer betting. A bail occurs in
the Town Hall, which is the local equivalent
of the Tuileries. The excitement L- intense.
Melba didn’t turn up at the ball, but pretty
Mrs. George Armstrong did, and so did son
George, who is always thoroughly at home
in an environment which contains horses.
I hear that Captain Gale, one of Governor
Stanley’s old helps, will return to liis
Stonington job again. He has left an arm
on the seat of war, so to speak, and is
therefore unable to fight any more.
Mrs. Vera Clarke Landale has left with
her family in the wake of her military hus-
band. Fie has rejoined his old regiment, and
expects to be sent across Channel in the
spring.
The Charley Ryans’ only son Rupert,
who is in the R.H.A., got engaged just
before going to face the foe. The girl is
the daughter of a British General named
liammersley.
Tom Grice is off to the place where most
of the young men, are heading. Tom, who
lost liis elder brother in the S’African war.
was a lieutenant on the army list before he
returned to Australia and sheep-farming.
His wife is accompanying him as far as
London.
Geoff. Kiddle, the local polo-player who
got a lot of military experience in India,
is at the front with a Territorial Regiment.
His sister Rita has settled down temporarily
in London.
The matinees at Her Majesty’s are a
withering reply to those who mourn for a
declining birth-rate. The theatre is packed
to the ceiling every Wednesday and Satur-
day by nippers. There were 20 in one
stage-box last week, crowding each other
like fledglings in a nest. When the Clown
applies a red-hot poker to the police the
atmosphere reeks with innocent gladness in
which the one faint element of regret is
the fact that the malign official’s trousers
are not burned completely off him. The
great attraction, however, is the sausage-
machine. The little angels yell ecstatically
at the sight of Pantaloon throwing babies
and nursemaids, police and messenger-boys
into it, while his accomplices sneak off with
the resulting sausages.
Yours sincerely,
JOHANNA.

What is the Best Beauty Soap
for the Complexion ?
There is at present a great controversy
going on in the English newspapers about
the best soap to use for the complexion.
Some advocate the use of one and some
another kind, but they are all satisfied on
one or two points, and those are that for a
soap to be beneficial to tlie skin, must be
one without coloring matter, and without a
lot of strong, coarse, irritating perfume being
added, and also that the soap must be made
from good ingredients without a preponder-
ance of soda, which makes the skin hard.
An English soapmaker has been able to
combine all the above good qualities in a
soap, and at the same time to incorporate
some of the pu'ritol wax, which is so much
in demand as a complexion beautifier and
protective, sc that on washing with Puritol
Wax Soap there is a trace of the wax left
on the skin, which, by its continuous sooth-
ing and corrective action on the skin and
its pores, keeps it in a healthy and pure
state, and prevents the formation of pimples
and blemishes on it.
THE HOWARD: Exact.
In 1829 EcHvard Howard was apprenticed to
Aaron Willard, Jun., the descendant of a long
line of English Watchmakers, who settled in the
Massachusetts Colony about the middle of the
eighteenth century.
In 1840 he started in business for himself. UP
to that time watches had always been made by
handwork exclusively. Howard’s plan was to
make automatic tools that should perfect the
parts of a watch, leaving to the hand the task ot
assembling and finishing the parts.
In 1842 the first Howard Watch was produced
—a thoroughly practical watch. The Howard ot
to-day is the" finest practical timepiece m the
world for a man to carry in his pocket.^
It has a patented hard-tempered steel balance,
which will not knock out of true with the jolt
and jar of the severest service. _

POLITICAL
POINTS
The Victorian Government has promised
to introduce a Bill restoring political rights
to railway servants, and undoing at last an
act of gross injustice. The fact that it has
not been undone long ago shows the remark-
able patience with which the democrat can
put up with tyranny —next door.
THE WATCHER.
PRESIDENT WILSON : "I could stop him run-
ning amok if I like. But I don't like."
“F. Born”: David Gaunson once said in
an inspired moment: “Coalition is corruption
said softly.” But Party Government is
corruption, blatant, naked and unashamed.
The German is struggling with the tea,
coffee and cocoa problem. Supplies of one of
the three are urgently required in the
trenches. His best-loved coffee was long
since cut off. Then he took to tea, which he
got through Norway, Sweden, Denmark and

hibited export to all ports except those of

back on cocoa. In October, 1913, he con-
sumed 131.9201 b. of it. In October, 1914,
lie accounted for 1,238,61111). Then that was
cut off. Over a million sacks of coffee were
still stored at Hamburg as collateral for a
loan. At latest advices lie had persuaded
himself, as he did of the French wool, “that
the hypothecated coffee ought to be sold at
prevailing prices, in order to relieve impend-
ing famine, and the proceeds applied on the
loan.” What will he do when-the Ham-
burg coffee runs out? Maybe, in the spring,
his fancy will turn to grass.
IN VINO VERITAS.
It is pathetic to find a man of Fisher's calibre —•
or what was supposed to be Fisher’s calibre —drawing
“a clear line” between what he really believes and
what he has professed to believe because it is a fea-
ture of the party programme.
THE BULLETIN (7/1/'15).
THE LASSIE: "Come along home, Andy.
You've broken you're pledge, an' I’m sorry
I married you.”
FISHER : "Pledge! (hie) be biowed! I only
signed it just to catch you, you little
duck."
South Wales finds itself in shameful
rivalry with New South Wales. In New
South Wales the disgrace happened at
Cockatoo Dock; in South Wales at Neath
Municipal Gas Works. Still the Dock holds
a comfortable lead in the matter of
ingloriousness, as the maximum of damage
done at Neath would lie inconvenience to the
troop trains passing through.
“Marc Antony” on a disgrace: —
In these days when We hear so much about the fillip
the war will give our industries, it would have done
an Australian good '’to go down and sec the freak
steamer Annum unloading. In Sydney I saw 500 cream
caiis, made iif Norway, being unshipped. A cream can
for our State-aided cow-cocky is a thing that any
plumber in any country town could make, and make
better. I didn't find out the names of the consignee,
but I'll bet lie is a flag-flapper on Empire Day, and
is at present telling Australia it ought to send 100,000
men “to help the Empire.”
Certain unions have served notice on the
Australian Government that they expect all
labor required/ for the fitting out of trans-
ports to be engaged through the Trades Hall.
It would be a noble idea if only the Trades
Hall would reciprocate by promising to bog-
in strenuously at fitting out the transports.
But when the Cockatoo Dock toilers at
Sydney refused double pay to work in the
country’s interests during the Christmas
holidays, and declined to care one hurried
damn for the country unless they got triple
pay, and the Trades Hall didn’t interfere,
that institution lost some of its reputation
for speed. These are times when speed is
wanted.
Percy Hunter, the official who does every-
thing and goes everywhere, has returned to
N.S.W. to see the Government about immi-
gration ! Now, what does N.S.W. want
immigration for? Two-thirds of the State
is losing the population it already possesses,
and half the railways aren’t paying, because
the Government policy has made the country
unfit to live in. No decent person would
send immigrants there. And in Sydney a
semi-pauperised multitude is being shoved
into tents bought with loan money because
the place is so full that it can’t hold immi-
grants. Why not drop the subject, and toll
Percy to get work?
Wonthaggi, Victoria’s State coalfield, hav-
ing decided to quit the vicious “club” system
and go in for decent hotels, made a start just
after the New Year. The district is entitled
to 15 pubs, but the Court decided that seven
would be enough to go on with. Of the
seven successful applicants only one was a
woman ; but she got off the mark easily first.
Having a boarding-house suitable for an hotel,
she chanced it and laid in a stock of liquor;
and 15 minutes after she got her license
the beer-pumps were at work. There was,
by the way, no application for a license for
that State hotel that Peter Mcßride —or
was it John Weary or Johnny Fawkner?—
promised long ago. Yet Wonthaggi offered
the finest opportunity in Australia for show-
ing the beauty of State or municipal control
of liquor trading.
Strike trouble, threatened by the New
South Wales Boilermakers’ Union, which
wanted more wages and found that the
Industrial Court had directed Wages Boards
not to make new awards during tin; currency
of the war, has been dodged by the Industrial
Court turning a somersault and agreeing
that the Wages Board might consider the
grievances of the men. This illustrates one
of the weak features of the Industrial law
under the truckling Holman-llall Adminis-
tration. The intention of the Act was to
put an end to the strike foolishness; but it,
generally speaking, is only the union which
is prepared to strike that gets what it wants.
When a union goes to a Board with a
bludgeon more or less ostentatiously bulging
under its coat, the employers’ representatives
mostly yield, but weak unions are fearlessly
fought by the employers. The powerful
Boilermakers’ Union obtains an award as
the alternative of a vexatious strike, while
scores of other unionists, with as strong a
grievance but a weak organisation, have to
sit still and chew coke.
Cann, probably the most well-meaning
man in the N.S.W. Ministry, found a ghost
on his doorstep last Friday. It was the
spectre which might have been exnected. This
is a record of its ancestry:—
(1) The Labor Government wants to mollify, with
high wages and easy times, everybody who can be
expected to vote for it.
(21 It is much easier to mollify with loan money
than with plain honest work. At bootmaking or
tailoring no man can get more than the value of his
output. On public works he may get 20s. for build-
ing 10s. worth of railway leading to nowhere. It all
.•.depends on how the loans hold out.
So a lot of unemployed, instead of asking
Federal Minister Tudor for a new tariff
which will promote boot-factories, rushed
State Minister Cann with a demand for
more loans and more public works. And
Cann, knowing that N.S.W. has already
2000 miles of insolvent railway on its hands,
and maddened by the impossibility of getting
blood out of a post, said the sort of things
in last Saturday’s papers that George Dibbs
might have said 20 years ago. He alleges
that he offered work in the country at 10s.
per day, and that the offer was turned down
(1) because the applicants wouldn’t sleep
in a tent, and (2) because they wouldn’t
leave Sydney. This ought to have made
Cann give three cheers, it being the steady
policy of his Government to drag all popula-
tion and industry to Sydney. Strange to
relate, he didn’t cheer worth Old.
THE RAT-HOLE.
Another instance of State interference has
greatly annoyed Private Enterprise in Mel-
bourne. A Malvern confectioner was
charged with selling lollies badly infected
with—the analyst called them caterpillars.
Private Enterprise pleaded that he had sold
quantities of the goods to small boys and
“had had no complaints about the things.”
Perlraps not. But the trouble with these
adulterators is that they will insist on doing
the mixing themselves. If they think people
like caterpillars why not sell the caterpillars
separately and let the people mix them to
suit their own varying tastes? Failure to
follow this simple rule of fair dealing cost
the Melbourne man £5.
The struggle to pay Paul with Peter's
lOU is a dreary business. S. Australia,
being hard up, got the brilliant idea of bill-
ing the Australian Government for £750.
being alleged wear and tear of a wharf
where the mails are loaded and unloaded.
The Australian Government tottered a little,
and said that it thought the £22,000 a year
which it paid to S.A. for the carriage of
mails included the wharf. Then it presented
the Crow-eater State with a bill amounting
to about £50,000 for the use of Federal tele-
graphs for the conveyance of State shipping
news. Now the £750 lion and the £50,000
lion roar along the strand, and each says
the other is a fraud.
WILLIAM'S BIRTHDAY HAPPENS
THIS MONTH.
According to London Daily Matt, the
Germans say - “the United States are the
next on greedy Japan's list.” On the other
hand, Winston Churchill says that if Britain
goes down the United States are the .next
on Greedy Germany’s list. Uncle Sam is in
for a bad time whatever happens, if the
prophets know their business.
Premier Holman’s recent illness and his
suggested retirement to the Agent-General’s
office caused a fierce struggle among the
partisans of those who are considered to
have a kind of lien on the N.S.W. Labor
leadership. There is a Cann faction, a Hall
faction, a Carmichael faction and even a
Griffith faction. Carmichael is making the
pace hot, and is bidding for the support of
the Tote party ; but Cann, despite his scorn
of syntax, is more popular in the Caucus, at
present, than any other member. Hall’s
plausibility and complacency, and his “keen
eye for the main chance,” may, however,
enable him to elbow Cann out.
The latest idea of the N.S.W. Education
Department, where the Labor Government
is doing its best administrative work, is to
establish a bureau from which boys will be
drafted into vocations most suitable to their
talents. It should save a lot of waste and
misery and failure. The man who would
grow potatoes with enthusiasm is too often
put to a desk he detests, while those whose
enthusiasms are clerkly may be fastened to
the job of carting bread or planting bodies.
Even the job of planting bodies would rouse
the enthusiasm of some people, but they
are mainly people who have been put to
other jobs.
The liquor referendum to be taken in
South Aus. on March 27. simul’ meously with
the general election, is on a principle novel
to Australia. The question at issue is the
hour at which the pubs shall close. Electors
may vote for G, 7. 8,9, 10 or 11 p.m. Votes
in favor of any time before G p.m. and after
11 p.m. will be informal. Such votes as favor
G p.m. will be counted first, and if they are
a bare majority. 6 p.m. has it. If not, they
are added to the votes for 7 p.m. If still
no majoritiy, the 6 and 7 p.m. lots are added
to 8, and so on. Bung will, of course, plump
for 11 o’clock and Cold Tea for 6. Between
them will be a vast and struggling herd of
puzzled citizens.
An anonymous person, who said she was
a lady, was permitted to burst forth in
Sydney Sunday Sun with a statement that
the Germans perpetrated none of the atroci-
ties charged against them, and, even if they
did, the Russians and Belgians, when they
captured a foreign town, were as bad, or
worse. Unfortunately for the story, the
Belgians haven’t captured any hostile town
in which to dp atrocities, so the clumsy
Prussian correspondent is the same uncon-
vincing liar, as per usual.

In the olden days, so the poets sing,
The peasant paid up to his church and king ;
While he slaved at field-work and dulled his brain
His betters called round for the oxen and grain ;
And the serf of the Soil, the Crown and Cross
Dared make no moan for his grievous loss.
With arrogant bishops and wastrel kings,
The toilers’ substance grew falcon’s wings,
And flew from the kennel where naked brats
Played round in the litter or starved like rats;
But the bondman, ever with eyes cast down,
Toiled on like a Briton for Cross and Crown.
Then Freedom came with a flaming brand
And fired all the hovels throughout the land,
And the years brought ease and the fair towns soared,
And the serf gave less to bishop and lord,
And the kings grew civil and well-behaved,
And reformers cheered for a land well saved.
Now the Trust is bishop and baron, too,
And the hind must give it its dreadful due.
It doesn’t arrive with a cross or sword,
Like the old-time bishop or swaggering lbril ;
But it roars for gold like the hungry sea,
While we dream like slaves that at last we re free.
And it only proves to the wise, my brother,
That we lose one master to gain another.

PHONOGRAPHS
When buying a talking machine it is wise to get the best in the first in-
stance and enjoy the most beautiful music from the outset. That the
Edison Phonograph is the most satisfactory instrument is an established
fact the world over. It runs smoothly and perfectly, and reproduces clearly
and correctly. The highest expression of technical and artistic perfection
is maintained.
An Edison Phonograph is invaluable when you have company, and indis-
pensable when you are lonely or gloomy. It meets all moods and all
occasions. Even an impromptu dance is easily arranged at any time, and
the Phonograph will provide the music for Waltzs, Polkas, Two-steps,
Lancers, Tangos, etc.
Because of the non-wearing surface of the Edison New Blue Amberol
Records they may be played indefinitely.
It will pay you to call on your nearest Edison dealer and examine a few
models, or write direct to us for a free copy of Illustrated Phonograph
Catalog.
No advance in price.
The increased Customs duty on Phonograph goods will not at present affect
the prices. It is to your advantage to select a model immediately, because
we cannot say definitely how long the prices will remain so low as they are
now.

NOTIONS
Totalisator figures for Maoriland, Tas-
mania and South Aus. —the only Australasian States
where the machine is legalised—supply interesting-
comparisons. During the past year Maoriland had an
increase in investments of £74,308 and Tasmania had
a lift over the previous figures of £53,720. On the
other hand, S. Australia showed a tendency to betting-
soberness Jjy a decrease of £15,147. The betting-
turnover for N.S.W. and Victoria isn’t procurable.
If it was, the parsons and others who have howled
the tote down would drop dead to see the size of the
cake they occasionally get a crumb from.
There were mysterious doings at the
Trafalgar (Vic.) meeting the other day. Lady M.
was made a hot favorite by her owner and that guile-
less section of the public which wagers on “form.
Then she went back in the betting with a rush. The
owner, being puzzled as well as alarmed, told' one of
the stipendiaries. Even as he was talking the mare
receded four or five points more. She was now at the
post with her jockey up. The owner got permission to
substitute another jockey—not that he doubted his
jockey’s bona fides, but on general principles. He
went to get his mare from the rider, but the latter
was so anxious to ride that he had to be almost;
dragged off. A touching instance of a man’s devotion
to his profession. Another jockey was hoisted on to
the mare. And now a strange thing happened. The
betting changed from any odds against to two and
even 3 to I on. After a hostile demonstration
on the part of the superseded joc-k, which several
bookmakers loudly applauded, the race was run, and
Lady M. won in a canter. A section of the ring
hcoted her vigorously as she was being,led in. It Was
all very mysterious—so much so that the local
authorities have laid the ease before the V.R.C., who
are well known to be interested in psychological
mysteries of the kind.
“O’Cork”: The success of the imported
Dollar Dictator in the recent two-mile Perth Cup
(17 starters), when he was backed to the extent of
only £39 10s., and paid £lB for every 10s., is
easily the brightest incident in the horse’s career.
He has been entered for the Australian Cup (2J
miles), run at Flemington early in March, despite the
fact that Sydney papers omit his name from the list
of nominations. Similarly ignored in Sydney are the
W.A. entries for the Aus. Cup. of the well-performed
. Corstep anil of Camballo. Dollar Dictator, now syrs.
old, was bred in the Cold Country by Jones-Nowlan.
He is by Earla Mor (son of the noted Desmond) from
Lady Strathmore. A. E. Cockram (W.A.) bought
him in England for 55gns., plus about £lOO in for-
feits due in connection with events in which the
horse was to engag'e. A few months ago Dollar
Dictator was on offer for about £3OO, but found no
buyer. After winning the Perth Cup lie was again
put up for sale. This time the highest bid was
725gn5., which was refused. The appearance of
tile W.A. trio at the V.R.C. Autumn meeting should
add interest to that fixture. The . Dollar Dictator
is half-brother to Shining Way, a good performer
in India, and third in last Viceroy’s Cup.

That good horse. Sir Alwynton, who with
Bst. 51b. in last Melbourne Cup, gave the winner,
Kingsburgh, 211 b. and was beaten by only half a
neck, in the record time of 3min. 26sec., is again
leased by J. S. Agnew from R, W. Clancy. The
prad has been moved from R. A. Campbell’s to J.
Burton’s stable, and is on the training track again.
Ross Reid, who died on January 11, was
one of South Australia’s most prominent sports in
the ’7o’s. Best of his good horses was Pride of the
Hills, winner of the S.A. Derby in 1876 and of the
Champion Stakes in 1877.
With a prizeless record since 1912, a
horse called Sandstream was started in the Borough
Handicap at the recent Woodville (M.L.) meeting.
There were 10 other runners, and the general
opinion of Sandstream was represented by four £1
tote supporters. General Opinion was annihilated.
Sandstream won and paid £lBO dividend.
Francis Foy (N.S.W.) was a fairly exten-
sive buyer of blood stock during his recent visit
to England. In addition to some private purchases
he invested as follows: A colt by Marajax from
Auntv Hilda, 50gns. ; filly foal by Marajax from
Powderplay, 30gns. ; Powderplay (foaled 1908), by
Jeddah from Wheelabout, and covered by Marajax,
90gns. ; filly foal by Ouadi Haifa from Emigrant,
90gns. ; October, four-year-old horse by Rock Sand
from Octoroon, 400gns.Patapan, two-year-old colt
by Polvmelus from Maya, 270gns.

known stallions have died or been destroyed in:
England: Martagon. Zinfandel. Ladas, Collar, Gold-
finch, Matchbox, Carbine (Maoriland-bred), Mer-
man (Australian), Rock Sand, Sir Visto, St. Frus-
quin.

Australia was a generous buyer at the
last blood-stock sales in England. The Victorian
sport, J. N. McArthur, purchased five promising
animals —Lady Victoria, four years, by St. Frus-
quin from Lady Cynosure (sister to Polymelus)
covered White Eagle, 650gns. ; Clarissa, four
years, by Cicero from Lobeite, by St. Frusquin,
covered by Catmint, 250gns. ; a three-year-old filly
b.v Neil Gow from Prune, by Persimmon, 320gns. ;
two-year-old filly by The White Knight from Van-
rienne, by Galopin. 95gns. ; White River, four-year-
old mare by The White Knight from Gyp, bv Graf-
ton, 140gns. Among many other purchases for Aus-
tralia two of special interest were Niekle Neck:
(foaled 1906), by Carbine from Imperious, covered
bv Grey Leg, 105gns. ; and a yearling filly by
Fitz Grafton from Comedy, 20gns.

The British Government has seized some
valuable foreign racehorses undergoing training in-
England during the past few months, but it seems to
have made a particularly gorgeous scoop when it
commandeered the well-performed Adular (Bogdany—
Duczi), owned by the Hungarian Government and!
raced by Baron Springer. Last season, in England,.
Adular started eight times, had four wins and ran .
into two minor places. His weights ranged from
7st. 71b. to lOst. 21b. Many qualified sports declare-
that Adular is worth £20,000.
The fight between N. S. Wales and South-
Aus. for the Sheffield Shield brightened up too late-
to arouse much enthusiasm in Sydney’s breast. (In-
cidentally, Sydney’s breast as a receptacle for cricket:
enthusiasm appears to be becoming less expansive.)
N. S. Wales won by 16 runs, but the Xl’s luck in:
having a weak strategist in charge of the enemy was
the main factor in the victory. No doubt can be
entertained that Mavne’s method of attack had on
the South Oss. team a disheartening effect, which
resulted in some slovenly field work. Lives and runs
were given away in a manner that calls for dis-
courteous language to an Australian State representa-
tive eleven. Bar’dsley, who made over the century in
the first innings, was dropped twice before lie had
scored 30.
Why Mayne over-worked Whitty and James at the
bowling creases is not clear. In Ma’s first innings
Whitty howled 37.1 and James 42 overs, while the
other four trundlers sent down only 25 overs between
them. In the second innings Whitty propelled 40
overs and James 20, while five others accounted for
30 overs. In the match, therefore, Whitty bowled
77.1 overs, James 62 overs and the other trundlers 61.
No doubt Mayne had a reason for this that appealed to
him ; hut, so far, it hasn’t made much of an appeal
to anybody else.
In 23 years’ struggles for the Sheffield Shield
N.S.W. has won 14 times, Victoria six, and S. Aus-
tralia three. Ma has won 33 matches from S.A. and
lost 14 ; while against Victoria she has a credit of 53
wins and a discredit of 40 losses.
-X- * -X-
While N.S.W. wicket-keeper A. Ratcliffe
has not shown better than ordinary form behind the
sticks in inter-State cricket this season, he has turned
a broad bat to the ball. In six efforts he has scored
146 runs (twice not out) —an average of 36.5 ; and
the smiting of 29 and 59 against S. Aus. should keep
his place warm for the match against Victoria, which
completes the round.
W. J. Whitty lias an unusual howling-
record in this season’s Sheffield cricket. Against Vic-
toria he got two for 112 and three for 101 ; while v.
N.S.AV. his labors panned out at four for 113 and
six for 102—15 wickets for 428 runs. Even allowing
for the disheartening dropping of catches, Whitty’s
arm appears to be going on strike.
Schoolboy J. M. Taylor’s meteoric rise in
Australian first-class cricket is well-nigh without
parallel in New South Wales. From college, cricket
he was lifted over the intermediate stages into the
State XI, and in this season’s turmoil has scored 159
runs in six innings—a promising start with the big-
fellows.
Westralia has been angling for a visit
from a N. S. Wales XI at Easter. It offers 75 per
cent, of the net profits. The N.S.W. Association
doesn’t reckon the prospects good enough.
Canterbury continues to hold the fort in
Maoriland cricket. Successive onslaughts for the
Plunkett Shield by Otago and Auckland were re-
pulsed ; and, last week, Wellington followed the in-
glorious example of the other assailants, and was
crushed by 92 runs. Canterbury’s grip on the shield
is very tight this season.

of Maoriland cricket. Playing for Wellington against
Otago he scored 222 not out. This is the highest
individual score in the big-match records of the
quaking islands. He gave one chance at 219. There
was some tall scoring in the game, which was un-
finished. In its first strike Wellington tallied 498.
Otago replied to that vote of censure on its bowling
with a mere 138, and was sent in again. It was still
in when the time limit was reached and the books
showed 428 for seven wickets.

-.. Some bright bowling averages in Sydney
senior-grade cricket last Saturday: Dupain, for
Western Suburbs, against Middle Harbor, five for
19 ; Bull, for Middle Harbor against W.S., seven for
130 ; Wall, for Balmain against Paddington, six for
64. Middle Harbor was mowed down by the Western
Suburbs bowling, scraping together only 54 in its
innings (the first).
Billy McNabb, of Weston (N.S.W.), had
the unique experience of being knocked clean over
the ropes and out of the ring at Sydney Stadium
•on Saturday night. Fritz Holland supplied the
momentum. At other periods of the contest Holland
smote Billy on the jaw and dropped him for eight
•seconds, and under the left ear, which caused the
lad from the North to remain in a thoughtful atti-
tude on his hands and knees for six seconds. Alto-
gether, Holland punished the game and rugged novice
severely before the acrobatic finish above mentioned.
Frequenters of the Stadium had been led astray by
McNabb’s hurricane victory over Jimmy Fitton a
few weeks ago. They said, in their haste, “The
lad who can do this is a Coming Champion.” In
point of fact, McNabb is little more at present than
a violent jiuncher with a notable capacity for assim-
ilating punishment. If the hiding he got from
Holland hasn’t injured his self-confidence, and if he
is satisfied to put in six months or so with a Master,
such as Dave Smith, he may do something yet.
Such Spartan valor as he possesses is a valuable
asset.

It looks as though the meeting between
Dave Smith and Ben Doyle for the Heavyweight
Championship of Australia will be fixed up, after all.
Dave has been standing out for 30 per cent., and the
consensus of public opinion is, that as an indubitable
local champion, he ought to get it. The idea is that
Dave and the ex-shearer with the considerable waist
and the benevolent face shall clash some time next
month.
Ex-amateur champion light-weight of Aus-
tralasia W. Sliutt met P. Cook, of Maoriland, in a
professional way recently at Timaru. Fifteeen rounds
was the distance, and Cook cakewalked it. Purse,
£4O.
A New York sporting paper says: “If
Mike Gibbons can be induced to tackle Jimmy
Clabb3 r , with a referee’s decision at stake, there
shotild be no difficulty in deciding to whom the
middleweight title rightfully belongs,. TJiese Hw.Q
miclf]leweights stand out from all the others now that
Clahhy has disposed of Georfje Chip.” Not a word
about Jeff Smith, who fairly defeated Clabby in a
20-round bout in Sydney, and who would do it again
every time he was in condition. There must be some
basis for the Yankees’ dogged refusal to swallow Jeff
as a champion, and the likeliest explanation is his
apparent lack of a convincing punch. In the U.S.
they like a man who can go in and finish matters,
and incapacity or disinclination to do that is the
one’ chink in Smith’s glittering armor.
Lord Kitchener said to Irwin Cobb, of the
U.S. recently: “There is no better fighting man than
the Scotchman anywhere!” \Ve all know the Scotch-
man as a pursuer of money; and that there is money
in pugilism is best evidenced by the way Jews have
crowded into the profession in the last half-dozen
years. Yet there is hardly one Scotchman, or person
of Scottish lineage, in the front rank of the game.
Can any expert sociologist explain why?
A queer match lias just been fixed up—
Dave Smith v. Fritz Holland. Dave is Australia’s
champion heavyweight; Holland is a mere welter.
Dave has nothing to gain but his cut of the gate-
money if he wins, and a vast cargo of prestige goes
by the board if some hideous accident happens and
he is defeated. Arid the smiling, bald-headed Fritz
knows so much about the game, and is so strong, that
he is liable to defeat almost anyone.
The mystery concerning the sculling move-
ments of ex-champion Richard Arnst lias faded, and
the burly MaoriJander, who has been training regu-
larly for rnanv weeks, is said to have recuperated
sufficiently to find supporters for more matches. Aus-
tralian champion Jim Paddon will probably be the
first target, and, win or lose, Englishman Ernest
Barry is to have overtures made to him concerning
the- world’s championship.
The sculling match for the Maoriland
championship between the holder, Webb, and Hannan,
appears to be definitely fixed. As previously stated in
The Bulletin, Wanganui River will be the scene and
£2OO will be the lot of the victorious mariner.
Webb suggests the end of May, and Hannan’s anxiety
to meet the champion is such that he’ll probably
raise no objection.

Another Wilding has moved into tennis
championship limelight. This time it is the famous
Anthony’s brother. With Ollivier he took the doubles
championship of Maoriland last week. Curious that
Anthony has never figured in the doubles champion-
ship himself, although he has three years of singles to
his credit. F. Wilding, pa of the two brothers, and
R. D. Harman were doubles champions of the shick-
ery isles in 1887-1890-2-4. Racketing is evidently
the; family failing.

Narromine takes the N. S. Wales country
Tennis Cup for 1915, but it won’t be able to admire
it in the local tobacconist’s window without thinking
how close Trundle came to winning it. In both of
the semi-finals and the final only three games in eacli
case separated the teams, the score for the final being
four sets 38 games to four sets 35 games. Tenter-
field took the ladies’ championship rather easily from
Bathurst. Jimmy Anderson is country singles cham-
pion, C. Todd and K. Bloomfield doubles, and Miss
Case (Lithgow) boss lady.
The usual last act of the country tennis week in
Sydney is Metrop. v. Country, four matches (two for
ladies and two for gents.) Metrop. took the lot. But
the agricultural backbone of the community
didn’t let the city have everything its own
way. H. Moore and C. Todd beat A. B. Jones
and Wright and also Marsh and L. Todd, and J. O.
Anderson and N. Heath beat Marsh and Todd after a
hard fight. H. Rice showed that he still has a kick
left, and with Dr. Pockley won his three rubbers.
Victorian bowlers are endeavoring to get
their N. S. Wales brothers to reconsider their
decision to postpone the Easter carnival. There is not
the slightest hope of the Ma State Officials altering
their minds. The conclusion was come to after
months of deliberation, and those responsible are
quite satisfied that they will not countenance a
time of genera] rejoicing amongst bowlers until the
European outlook warrants it. The money that
would have been spent for the carnival has been
added to a fund of £l5OO dispatched to help tire
patriotic fund, and players have promised to double
this amount if necessary. After the trouble, the
jubilation; till then no hallelujah, as far as N.S.W.
is concerned.
When American motor-cyclists race, they
do race. In the 300-miles road-race, held at Savan-
nah at the end of November there were 33 starters,
Early in the proceedings one rider skidded and
killed himself on the spot. Another hit a tree and
died on the morrow. Lee Taylor, on an Indian, was
the winner, in shrs. 2min., an almost exact 60 m.p.h.
average. But you can’t imagine 60 miles an hour
for five hours on Australian roads and only two
deaths!
N.S.W. Cyclists’ Union has taken the axe-
handle to the Barwons who have chanted. Israel’s
national anthem at bike meetings in Sydney. The
Union alleges that the books have been offering
“bribes” to the pedallers, and thus causing pollu-
tion. The arm of the nearest John Hop concluded
the argument. The efforts of the Union to keep its
pastime out of the slush are commendable, particu-
larly if it is anxious about its own interests. If
from the Sydney cycling tracks another unpleasant
odor arises, that may be the Finish.

Kahanamoku showed Brisbane a turn of
liis speed on Saturday in the Dry Dock. In the
100yds. Invitation Race he did the distance in
56 l-ssec., and finished second. The time was not his
best (his . record —a world’s- —is 53 4-ssec., made at
Sydney recently), but it mightily cheered up the
large crowd that watched the big human fish. The
winner was K Pierce, who had a 12sec. get-away.
His time was lmin. 6 l-ssec. Kahanamoku and his
friend Cunha won the 200yds. brace relay race fairly
easily, as they won the relay in Sydney. The Hawaiian
ripped through his 100yds. of water in 57Jsec., his
partner doing the distance in 60sec. #
Two swimming championships were got
off on Saturday—the half-mile of Victoria, at Mel-
bourne, which G. W. Morris won by three yards in
12min. 15sec. ; and the 100yds. (country) of Queens-
land, won by T. Dowzer, of Rockhampton, bv six
yards in lmin. 7 4-ssec. As records go the times
were slow.
F. M. Ilalforcl is dead at the age of 70.
He invented a new sport-—that of dry
and wrote agreeably on the subject which was the
absorption of his life. The Fly Fishers’ Club—a
quaint little London eyrie—possesses ’ a unique cab-
inet of examples given by him of the flies to be
found on dry-fly streams. The “Halford Dry Sly
patterns” are still recognised as the best in the
world, and though they are almost double the usual
price they easily hold their own on the market.
Maybe it was because of this that he was able to die
worth £77,862.
N.S.W. Rugby League has again outbidden
fhe opposing armv of winter sports and secured the
lease of the Sydney Cricket Ground for the cold
seasons extending till 1918. The League also keeps
its monopoly of the Agricultural Ground, and more
than a passing interest in the Sports Ground and
suburban enclosures where it is possible to gather
a “gate.” The struggle for a livelihood among the
other brands of football in Sydney is, therefore, cer-
tain to be strenuous. The Rugby Union will, as last
season, hold its big fixtures on University Oval, the
Soccerites will boot at Epping, and the Australian
Rulers at Erskineville as of yore. That’s the inten-
tion. How it will all pan out depends on how much
more thumping Kaiser Bill is looking for.

Touching the alleged unwillingness of the
sporting section of Australia to go to the front.
W. W. Hill, of the N.S.W. Rugby Union, supplies the
official figures for his State, and they are nothing for
our flannelled oafs to be ashamed of. Over a thud
of the first-grade cricketers are either gone or m
camp. And it has to be remembered that by no
means all of the first-grade men are of the age the
authorities want. Among Rugby players one XV has
lost 10 of its men. Twenty-six have gone from the
Manly Swimming Club, and 14 from the Sydney
Club. Eighteen professional boxers are on their way,
and more are going, and there are enough golfers to
fill a transport on their own.
A Scotchman who recently arrived in
Maoriland has been showing the local talent some-
thing about weight-hurling. The other day ,he heaved
the 221 b. shot 35ft. Sin. The same-weighted hammer
he swung 86ft. 7in. He stands over 6ft. in height,
weighs 15st., is under 25 years of age, and his name
is Peter Munro.

“R.S.V.P.” : Bill Williams was our dis-
trict’s champion pigeon-shot, and when he departed
to compete in a big metropolitan shoot, we sent all
our spare cash to a city agent and heavily backed
him to return with the gold mug, or whatever the
prize was. News of the results duly arrived, but
Bill had come nowhere, and we were depressed at
the thought that we hadn’t even had a decent run for
our money. In a day or so Bill returned in a new
rig-out and with the triumphant air of a man who
had done things. AVe demanded an explanation. “Oh,
/ did all right,” said Bill. “In the big sweep the
fellow in front of me was chopping up"the birds a
treat every time. I picked up one of his eases and
found it was a 10-bore, carrying about an ounce
and a half of shot. Protest? Not me. I backed
him and won 40 quid!”

A FEW HOMELY
. . HINTS ON . .
BEAUTY
By RITA MOYA.
Every woman should take pride in her personal appearance. If it is not possible to
be beautiful in the fullest sense of the word, at least you can have the attractiveness of a
pleasant expression, glossy, well-kept hair, eyes shaded by long Joshes, well
brows and a clear, natural complexion. My first advice is to avoid most manufactured
“beautv preparations.” Use simple, pure, natural ingredients. Lse these regularly, and do
normake constant^changes and experiments. The various things I use and advise can be
bought in original packages from any reliable chemist. If they are not in stock he can at
once procure them from his wholesaler if you insist. %
How I Discarded an Unsightly Complexion.
—How many women exclaim as they hen out
their ugly complexions in the mirror: It l
could only tear off this old skin!” and. do you
know, it is now possible to do that very thing:
Not to actually remove the entire skin all or a
sudden; that would be too heroic a method
and painful, too, I imagine. The worn-out
cuticle comes off in such tiny particles, and
so gradually—requiring about 10 days to com-
plete the transformation —it doesn’t hurt a bit,
Day by day the beautiful complexion under-
neath conies forth. Marvellous! No matter
how muddy, rough, blotchy or aged your com-
plexion, you can surely discard it by this
simple process. Just get some ordinary mer-
colised wax at your chemist’s, apply nightly
like cold cream, washing it off in the morn-
ings.
New Painless Way to Remove Hairy
Growths.— lt now transpires that the mys-
terious white paste used so successfully by
many beauty specialists for ridding the skin
of objectionable hairy growths is nothing
more than powdered pheminol, which can he
found in any chemist’:* shop. With pheminol
and water make enough paste to cover hairy
surface; apply, and in two or three minutes
rub off, wash the skin, and it will be free
from hair or blemish.
Shampoo and Hair Beautifler. —You complain
of brittle, faded hair. You will find that keep-
ing the scalp clean and healthy is the most
effective way to restore the natural beauty
and softness, but in selecting your shampoo
avoid soaps or mixtures containing “free”
alkali. By dissolving a teaspoonful of stallax
in a cup of hot water you will have a mild,
soothing, cleansing mixture that makes the
head feel fine and removes all dust, dandruff
and excess of oil, leaving the scalp clean and
pliant, and assuring a beautiful growth of
long, lustrous, fluffy hair.
No Powder Necessary.— Yes, powder has
ruined more complexions that it has aided,
and while you use it you can hope for nothing
better than an imitation of a real complexion.
Take my advice. Get from your chemist some
ordinary cleminite and dissolve in a little
water, then you will have an ideal yet inex-
pensive lotion, which seems a part of the skin
The result lasts all day long even under tlu
most trying conditions. To prepare the face
and neck for an evening in a hot ballroom
there is nothing to equal this simple and harm
less lotion.
If Eyelashes are Short. —Eyelashes will b
greatly beautified if mennaline b<2 applied af
lash-roots with thumb and forefinger. A
few such treatments make them grow long
silky and curly. Thin, straggly eyebrows will
grow thick and lustrous by merely rubbing
mennaline on, but be careful and don’t gei
any where no hair is wanted.
Wonderful Growth of Hair. —Long ago 1
made a resolution to tYy and concoct a real
hair grower. My own formula, now perfected
after tedious experime?iting, has had the effect
of giving me a wealth of hair that is surpris-
ing. Obtain from your chemist an original
package of boranium and mix with this i-pint
of bay rum. Rub this into the scalp night
and morning with the finger tips. It sets the
hair roots tingling with new life. [6

Carson’s recent advertising howl at
Bangor (Wales) about the Irish Home
Buie trouble being merely held over
until the War is finished shows how
the barometer has risen since the
heavens fell last August. It is the dis-
contented A.B. saying that he will kick
up another row about the grub when the
gale has blown itself out. No sailor has time
to make those promises while the old hooker
is still in danger of foundering.
“Hi” : The N.S.W. prisons have a library
run on the principle that anything of an
exciting nature may damage the morals of
the inmates. When Burglar Bill has got
through the period during which he is sup-
posed to meditate in seclusion on his sins, he
has a month’s mental diet of religious litera-
ture, and then “may be given books of a
secular nature.” They are books like “A
Diary of Two Parliaments,” by Lucy, and
they don’t appeal to Bill. If he can get a
piece of leadpencil he expresses his con-
tempt on tiie margin or across the letterpress.
He uses the pencil and the margin for other
things, too —for instance, to send messages
of cheer to other prisoners. One sentence in
Lucy’s book concludes with the words, “for
a very long time,” and the marginal com-
ment stands : “My Cod, yes ! One thousand
fore hundered and thirty to days to goe.” But
a terser criticism ran : “This book is as dry
as six months in quod.”
“Briner”: Now, ho! for Jervis Bay and
the Naval College. Fine old Gregor McGre-
gor could not see much, but he had a hand
in picking this site. Already there is a big
grey college with workshops and etceteras.
All Powers recognise now that the greater
part of a man’s naval training can be done
on land more cheaply than at sea. West
Point (IJ.S.) was the model of Duntroon,
and Annapolis (U.S.) is in part the model
for Jervis. The college stands on the
north-west of the bay, near Captain
Point, and the foreshore is dotted
with long slip-ways, boat-sheds and
bathing-sheds. There are extensive green
playing fields, with a parade ground. Vt
Captain Point there is a breakwater, and a
long sea wall is being built. Roads link up
all the edifices. The cadets’ quarters are in
four blocks, with airy classrooms, dormi-
tories, recreation and dining-rooms, and a
good kitchen. Finally, beside an administra-
tive block and quarters for married and un-
married officers, for- petty officers and for
seamen, there is a large and well-fitted labor-
atory and a machine shop; for engineering
enters more or less into the scheme of train-
ing for every officer. And skiffs and gigs
and cutters and a gymnasium. And —but
shorten it, and say that altogether it’s the
best place in Australia, and the most signi-
ficant.
“The Oldest Inhabitant”: The presenta-
tion of an oil portrait of himself to Richard
Teece recalls a group of fellows who attended
S. 11. Belcher’s Grammar School at Goulburn
(N.S.W.)—C. E. Maybury (Sheriff), Charles
11. Walsh (prothonotary) and Richard Teece
(A.M.P. Society). Belcher had his Gram-
mar School on the site of the present Supe-
rior State School, and was the leading south-
ern dominie of the ’6o’s. Maybury, leaving
there, went into the Justice Department, and
was C.P.S. at Bathurst when he was ap-
pointed sub-sheriff by his father-in-law,
“Bob” Wisdom, the Attorney-General. Than
Mr. Walsh no law officer in N. S. Wales has
a better record of painstaking service, As for
“Dick” Teece, his best testimonial is the pro-
gress made by the society of which he became
secretary 20 years ago, and general manager
and actuary in 1890. There are professional
people, of course, who wonder how he would
get along if he were left on his dead-own as
an actuary ; but all agree that he has a per-
fect genius for steering both his ship and
himself into smooth water.
The Bulletin doesn’t know whether it
was cause and effect; but it’s a fact, any-
how, that the son of one of the parties to
the last duel of any consequence fought in
Australia was the first Australian to become
an archbishop. Stuart Alexander Donaldson,
who was first Premier under Responsible
Government in N. S. Wales, and whose son
wears the gaiters at Brisbane, had ad-
versely criticised the Estimates of Surveyor-
General Mitchell, and Mitchell promptly
challenged his critic. One shot put a hole
in Donaldson’s hat, another just grazed
Mitchell’s ear and then the seconds stopped
the combat. The duellists were never friends
afterwards. The pistols used on the occasion
once belonged to the Rev. Henry Fulton,
the Anglican clergyman who was sent out
for his share in the Irish national effort of
1798.
“Scorpio”: The Australian is everywhere
but in Australia. There are colonies of him
in London, Paris, ’Frisco and Capetown.
He is among the horses in India and where
indigo, tea and coffee are raised. In
South Africa he churns out amalgam from
the banket formations, and in West Africa he
is sinking shafts, adding up figures, control-
ling machinery and defying the climate.
There is even a little Australian hamlet in
old Cornwall, teaching the natives how to
save tin economically. And the British
investor in Australia is the first to employ
Australians, Most of the big mines of
Westralia are manned by Australians. They
have been given the task of tickling out
profits, from propositions that were robbed
or rattled in their initial stages by foreign
invaders. And yet the Government must
have foreigners in important State jobs.
The Westralian Government motor-cars are
shod with German tyres, though Australian-
made ones are available. Jack Scaddan
let a contract for a German electrical
plant. Johnston let a foreign contract
for water-pipes for the Goldfields Water
Scheme. He explained his bad Austra-
lianism by pleading that he wanted
pipes in a hurry. As a matter of fact,
Mephan and Ferguson, the original con-
tractors, were prepared to manufacture them
in Australia as cheaply and as quickly.
Admittedly the pro-foreigner craze is easing-
down, as an outcome of the war; but unless
we can kill the unpatriotic idea that “the
foreigner can do it better,” I’m afraid it will
rage as fiercely as ever as soon as the howl of
battle dies away.

CATARRH CENTRES OF THE HEAD.
"Kat-ar-ah" Treatment provides an enlarged
supply of medicated air to soothe and heal
these discharging surfaces.
THE MENACE OF
CATARRH!
There are few human ailments which create such
discomfort and misery as Catarrh —the mother of
all disease. It pursues you at work and at play;
it is with you everywhere, threatening Deafness,
Throat Diseases, Bronchitis, Asthma, Dyspepsia,
Neuritis and Consumption; making you down-
hearted, ruining your hopes, wrecking your life
and holding a weapon of greater suffering
always before you.
Those offensive discharges from the nose, the partial loss of
hearing, the irritating head-noises, the dry “ stopped-up ” feel-
ing in the nostrils, the constant sneezing, the husky throat, the
frequent headaches, the continual hawking and spitting todislodge
the mucous secretions, the heavy tired feeling when you awake —*
these are as nothing compared with the fact that you are
inviting the entry of some worse affliction if you neglect Catarrh.
Free to Sufferers.
To all who are afflicted with Catarrh in any form I offer a FREE
TRIAL of “Kat-ar-ah” Inhalant. It gives immediate relief to
the inflamed membranes, clears the head, nose, throat and.
lungs, conveys health-giving, purifying and germ-destroying
medicated air to the affected parts and cleanses the nasal
passages of accumulated mucous. No matter how many remedies
you may have tried do not consider your case hopeless until
you have tried “ Kat-ar-ah ” Treatment.
When writing give your full name and address; be sure to
mention this paper, and enclose 3d. in stamps to cover cost of
postage. The Trial Bottle will be sent you by return mail,
together with a copy of my new and interesting booklet: “Catarrh
—its Cause, Symptoms and Treatment.” Send at once to

“Solomon Malaprop”: On New Year’s
Eve in Sydney 17,001 more passengers paid
11220 more in railway lares than on the
corresponding date in 1913. And New
Years Day showed an increase of 1067 pas-
sengers and £1265. Wherefore a lot of san-
guine folk say that the alleged war depres-
sion isn’t so bad, after all. It is curious
logic. The war is only five months old.
Already the Australian Government has
made it an excuse to borrow £18,000,000 or
£19,000,000 from the British Government,
and to arrange a loan of £10,000,000 from
the banks. The beginning of the war has
been the reason for a bigger burst than
usual. We are having the funeral feast on
credit to-night, and we will have the corpse
and the bill to-morrow, for these loans are
not likely to be repeated every five months
while the war endures. Last New Year’s
Eve and New Year’s Day were really paid
for with the money which John Bull lent
us for military and naval purposes. When
lie learns that it was, to a great extent, ex-
pended in beer at Leura he may lash liis tail
considerably.
Though the armies ravaged the champagne
district of France, and though Rheims,
the biggest centre of the industry, was still
being bombarded on Christmas Day, the
vignerons’ business seems to have gone on
much as usual. Charles Heidsieck, in his
26th annual report, says :
The vintage took place at the end of September,
and, thanks to fine weather, the grapes had matured
well, and the quality of the wine was assured. In
spite of all the unfavorable circumstances caused
by the departure of the able-bodied men to the
army, the old people and women, aided by the
owners, picked the grapes in a satisfactory condition.
The yield will be short in quantity, for there
will be only 4,400,000 gallons of wine fit
for champagne ; but Heidsieck thinks it will
be quite equal in quality to the average of
1904, which was an exceptionally good year.
“F.S.S.”: The Victorian Government
scatters between £7OOO and £lO,OOO a year
in what it calls “unforeseen” expenses. For
the past year the smallest item, £4 2s. 9d..
was paid for a presentation to Lady Stanley,
most likely a nosegay; while vaccination of
public servants cost onlv £7 Is. lid., which
seems cheap considering there are 36,000 in
the Railways alone, and over 25,000 in other
departments. Professor Skeats’s visit to
sample the Hepburn mineral springs at
Daylesford cost £94 125., and Peter
Mcßride’s visit to Paris to attend the Inter-
national Congress on Forestry ran up to
£127 15s. 9d. A reception in London to
Lady Fuller cost £202 55., and inaugurating
Sir A. Stanley ran into £638 odd, besides
the £6B it cost to lunch him in London. Then
the Premiers’ Conference absorbed £Bl6,
while late sittings of Parliament involved
£7l for taxis and crayfish suppers, and
numerous gratuities were given to public
servants for acting as secretaries to ail these
receptions, conferences, inaugurations, trips,
parties and picnics. Parliamentary officers’
services, inter-State Conference, £ll4 15s.
Allowances were also made to the Railway
Department to reimburse it for the following
services : Freight on water supplied to settlers
at Yatpool and Carwarp, £llB iOs.; printing
booklets on industrial efficiency, £36 4s. 3d.;
special trains for State Governor and Par-
liamentary parties, £173 55.; special tram
for visit of Anti-Sludge League to Ovens
River, £l2 12s. To members, opening and
prorogation of Parliament, £823 Bs. sd. ; to
members. Parliamentary visit to irrigation
areas £4 18s. ; to members, arrival of State
Governor. £lO7 12s. 3d.; to visitors and
others, £B6l 10s. 7d.; to British delegates,
Empire Parliamentary Association, £l6O 125.;
to officers, etc., Belgian training ship,
£65 Us.; to members of the Australian
Fleet £3l 10s. 9d.: to Warrnambool Boy
Scouts £7 7s. 7d.; to Gheringap to Maroona
Railway Construction Trust, £6 7s. 3d.; to
officers'of Parliament, £59 195.; to recipi-
ents of awards, Royal Humane Society,
£7 15s. 9d.
The Hawthorn (Melb.) Tramway Trust,
which is building an electric line to Bur-
wood, has taken a step which ought to be
the rule, instead of a novelty, by stipulating
for the exclusive use of Australian woods in
the construction of its cars. It reckons
these woods are more beautiful, stronger,
more durable and cheaper in the long run
than the soft imported tripe.

“U.S.”: Germans call the English “the
robbers.” Recalls a yarn. Somebody said
to Richmond, of the New York Central
Railroad: “You ought to shunt all your con-
ductors. They have all got diamond pins
and gold watches, and could only obtain
them by robbing travellers.” Richmond:
“Yes, they’ve got ’em: but the new chaps
would have to get ’em.”

“D.” : These are hard times for the N. S.
Wales citizen who desires to live the spec-
tacular -life. Champagne has gone up about
fiy.e shillings a bottle. A £3O tax has to be
paid -oil « high-powered mOtor-car —the sort
rlmt the.gay and care-free dashed up to,Med-
lowSih for lyhiiblv in the ' peaceful' past.
WhiSky, brahfry, 4flid -;o%er spirits are tip,
and so is beer. Cigars and cigarettes are
becoming almost unbuyable. The Tote has
been again shunted by the Government, and
a few Saturdays ago the bookies at Randwick
closed their bags and refused to bet any
more. If this sort of thing goes on, a, man
will have to walk to race-meetings, and not
only will he be precluded from getting
drunk when he gets there, but he will even
be debarred from the satisfaction of doing
in his money over the stiffened contestants.
“Take My Seat” : I crowded on to-the back
platform of a “Dreadnought,” and wedged
myself in amongst the picnic hampers. A
party of blokes fought their way on. Along
came a collector. “All fares paid here?” he
inquired from the road. “Yers!” growled
the nearest bloke, and looked carefully at
the horizon. The collector went away like a
lamb, leaving me with a penny in my hand
and an uncomfortable feeling that I was go-
ing to make the Sydney trams more unprofit-
able than ever. As soon as the cove was out
of earshot, the bloke remarked scornfully to
nobody in particular, “Wot th’ell d’ye want
to,.,pay yejpsfare for on an’ 'oliday? Got too
much mt&tfey with yer?” I fingered my
penny and said nothing. At the first stop,
the (collector, who had compared notes with
his mate, appeared again alongside the bloke.
“Show tickets, please!” he requested crisply.
The bloke slowly extracted a coin from his
vest pocket and paid up. Then the rest of
us paid up, shamefacedly, like detected
swindlers. Seems to me the revenue might be
substantially improved if young conductors
were instructed never to ask the bloke, as
gent to gent, if he has paid. The bloke has
only one answer when it is put to him that
way.

“The Germ” : Lately the papers chronicled
the fact that the State coalminers at Won-
thaggi (Vic.) had “bucked” against using
explosives branded Nobel’s, Glasgow, “Made
in Germany.” Poor innocents! Have they
never heard of the Nobel Dynamite Trust 1
The Beef Trust is a myth compared with it.
Modesty it knows not, and anyone walking up
Old Broad-street, London, may see its sign
carved in letters of gold. “The Nobel Dyna-
mite Trust.” Its troubles! Underneath it
sets forth the different companies it controls,
including the Nobel Hamburg Co, and the
Nobel Glasgow Co. When the Glasgow
workmen get saucy, and want a rise in
wages, the Trust “slows down” the factory
there and manufactures “Nobel’s Glasgow” at
Hamburg. If Hans, of Hamburg, strikes for
extra pfennigs the Trust reverses the pro-
cess. Unfortunately, the British Board of
Trade makes the crowd put the tell-tale
“Made in Germany” on the cases, and on
the paper wrappers round every plug. Other-
wise it would probably pose as a fine old
British company, and deduct saxpence per
week from its employees’ wages to send to
the Prince of Wales’ Fund. The outrageous
behavior of Mad Willie in Europe has cut
off the cheap-made article from Germany, so
the Trust raised the price of gelignite ss. a
case recently, on top of the already tropical
charges. The late Meat Trust Commission,
when requiring another job, or the Trading
With the Enemy Board, or some other old
thing, could dig up quite a lot of interesting
evidence as to the language the Trust uses
when it proposes the health of its Chairman,
after counting the profits squeezed from Aus-
tralian mines.
WASHING.
[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
The sky is like a tub of blue
Where soapsuds softly melt away;
The day, for those with nought to do
Is sweet; for me it’s washing-day.
A gentle breeeze blows from the sea,
But I must stay at home to scrub,
To rub the linen angrily
And drown my longing in the tub.
The sun streams in the laundry door
Upon a hill of dirty things
Which rises from the concrete floor ;
For every Monday morning brings
The same old pile to wash again—
To boil and rinse, to starch and blue.
I know each tear and inky stain
That passes through the weekly brew.
The fire is like the glowing sun,
The water’s ..frothy as the sea,
boiling bubbles lightly run
% Aropnd the copper buoyantly,
fbr the boiling! In they go!
sheet, a shirt, a baby’s dress:
’Twere hard to think (’tis shrunk up so)
How any garment could be less !
The starch to make —the fire to stoke —
A hundred different things to do!
The boiling clothes must have a poke
And then be dipped into the blue.
It’s nearly noon ! How old the day
Has ; grown while I’ve been splashing here!
And see iny hands. That is the way
We women lose our charm. Oh, dear!....
Pegging the clothes. The sun sends down
Upon my head a red-hot ray,
No wonder that my arms are brown—
But it’s a splendid drying day!
The clothes are flapping merrily
Like eighteen-footers in a gale ;
Their whiteness is a joy to me—
I love to stand and watch them sail.
And to and fro I watch them race —-
Until a tiny muslin dress
Flaps backward on my sunburnt face,
And leaves a scented, cool caress.

BEFORE A RUINED EATING-HOUSE.
[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
Before a ruined eating-house
At eventide I stand,
And think of those who held carouse
Around the noisy band.
The “To-Let” sign clings to the pane
That used to guard the sweets,
4rid heavy cakes that must have slain
The young in their retreats.
There’s nothing now but dusty boards
Behind the flaring sign :
Beyond no parties drink like lords
The sweetened wedding wine.
There’s only peace where riot dwelt
And laughter wild and shrill
Rang out, while dishes smoked and smelt,
And waiters scrawled the bill.
The brides are at the washing-tubs
Who flaunted here in white,
Attended by frock-coated cubs —
A mad and madd’ning sight.
Confetti litter that they threw
Has long been swept away:
Perchance their ghosts insanely strew
The path outside to-day.
Lord roast the cook who cooked in there,
A criminal was he!
I ate his crimes with nervous care,
And paid reluctantly.
But he lias gone! Gone ail who seired,
And she who rang the cash!
Some of the girls were nicely curved,
But most were bags of hash.
I feel, I say, no grief at all,
As, full of thought, I go
And leave that ruined eating-hall.
’Tis dead—’tis better so.

Some people do nothing for constipation and allow themselves
to be costive for days at a time. A more foolhardy thing cannot
be done as a constipated person is liable to all sorts of diseases.
To be indifferent to constipation is as unhealthy and uncleanly
as not to wash or bathe, for a bowel movement is to the inside of
the body what bathing is to the outside.
Instead of trying some make-shift that gives but temporary
relief take Chamberlain’s Tablets for the stomach and liver.
They regulate the bowels gently and scientifically and perfect
relief is brought about in the most obstinate cases.

There is little to show for a
Holiday without a KODAK.
What will you have to show for a holiday spent without a Kodak?
The sunburn on your face, the sand in your shoes, the smell of the sea and of the gum-leaves in youl*
clothes—these will remind you of your holiday for a few days. But none of these things last for long.
You soon forget all details of your holiday.
Your holiday memories will fade almost as quickly as your sunburn if you do not take a Kodak. But
take a Kodak and your holiday will last for ever! A holiday without a Kodak is a holiday wasted.
Don’t Waste your Holidays this Year: Take a Kodak!
There are Kodaks from 30/- to £l5/2/-
No. 1 & No. la FOLDING POCKET KODAKS.
These are wonderfully simple to operate, and are extremely popular with the
beginner and with those who wish to make pictures with the least effort.
No. 1 takes pictures 2J x4i inches. Price 50/-

A FEW QUERIES
that are of interest
Are you sure that the Grain Drill that you are
planning to buy is the one that is best for you
Is it the one that will sow the most evenly aftd
cause you the least annoyance and stoppage
Can you get it at the right price and on the
right terms
?
Have yon seen the new
used only on “Deering”
«IH C” Chain Drive Grain Sowing Device
and “McCormick” Drills
xvcxvc
If you can answer all these questions “yes” then we have nothing of interest
to you —But if not it will be greatly to YOUR advantage to write us for gratis
pamphlet explaining this new Sowing Device and to find out where you can
see one at work. "We only want you to see it.
We think it will SELL ITSELF,
Hadn’t you better write NOW ?

IN BANANA LAND
The Fat politicians avlio hold that the Meat
Trust in Queensland is inoffensive when it
isn’t actually benevolent may be right. But
something is wrong. Week before last cattle
prices at the Enoggera (Brisbane) sales had
been exceptionally high ; but last week’s were
as much as -£3 per head higher. Live beef
sold up to 70s. per 10011 )., and one bullock
was knocked down at £25 55., a Queensland
record. “Successive short yardings” were
blamed. But who is to be blamed for the
“successive short yardings” ? Beef Trust or
no Beef Trust, it is becoming pretty clear
that two things will have to be done: (1)
the slaughter of cows will have to be regu-
lated ; and (2) something will have to be
done to stop the murder of young calves.
The influence of the Great Daily is a
marvellous thing. For months past Bris-
bane’s two morning journals have been
hammering away at Digby Denham and tell-
ing Liberalism the time was “ripe and rotten
ripe for change.” Last week the Liberals
met and re-elected Denham, in despite of
their own great organs; and the gnashing
of teeth could be heard in the colonnades of
Camooweal.
From the Gallery :
Queensland Health Department has placards up in
the streets forbidding, citizens to spit on the pave-
ments. Will it please make use of the recess to
nail up a few in the Assembly Chamber, mentioning
“carpets” as a prohibited cuspidor?
From “The Understudy” :
The Liberal party’s pre-election meeting took place
last week ; but, as everybody knew that Premier Den-
ham had a majority in the bag, excitement was nqt
violent. After the shadow-sparring had lasted two
hours Hugh Macrossan moved that Denham retain his
job.' Twenty-five voted for and 21 against. The
reconstruction of the Cabinet has been left to the
leader. Railways Paget has definitely decided to
retire,* and John White, whose furry head makes him
uncannily like Norman Lindsay's native bear, will
probably go out, too. Colin Rankin, who knows a
lot about sugar, is almost sure to come in.
IN EGYPT.
PRIVATE BILL (off Dingo Gully): “These bloomin' warm socks ain't no good to us here,
Jim. They was made for the winter in Europe.”
PRIVATE JIM (of Woolloomooloo): “ Bli’me if I don't send mine to the Kaiser. He’s
got the coldest feet on earth."
Last Parliamentary session, though it
spread itself over 2829 pages of Hansard,
was one of the most barren on record. Even
the leading Tory journal wailed: “Important
measures promised were either not brought
forward or jostled out of place by a lot of
insignificant Bills.” Friction in the ranks
was the trouble, of course. With factions
tugging him this way and that, Denham com-
promised by marking time, though he knows
lie must soon Avear a hole through the thin
ice that way.
Died at his own IpsAvich, “Jimmy” Wil-
kinson, at the unripe age of 60 years. Jimmy
was the most truly representative man
Ipswich ever possessed. He was born in
that town, was a railway man and a jour-
nalist there, did a lot of early political
bullocking there, and represented the district
in the .Federal Parliament. In one respect
only did he differ from the true Ipswich
breed : he could never make a success of the
art of canting. Fie was an inveterate poli-
tician, and if there be a Workers’ Organisa-
tion on . the Further Shore he will be up for
selection as secretary or president within 12
months.
One E. J. Metcalfe, a director of the
British New Guinea Co., who recently
arrived in Australia to take stock of his
co.’s possessions in Papua, moans as he
contemplates the restrictions put upon cos-
mopolitan finance by the Australian Govern-
ment. He says that the native races are
being “pampered” to the detriment of Pri-
vate Enterprise, and that the ideal method of
handling them is the German one. From
Metcalfe’s standpoint this is correct. The
more the natives are allowed to be harried
by Private Enterprise the quicker the Em-
pire’s Metcalfes will be able to set up
in Park Lane or the Champs Elysdes. But
that prospect does not enthuse either Aus-
tralia or the Empire. The Commonwealth
has its money wrung out of it to be spent
elsewhere, qnd the Empire has its niggers
disaffected. If Metcalfe were more intro-
spective, he might even now be pondering
the ultimate value of the German way. It
has already brought tens of thousands of
natives into this war, filled with a fanatic
desire to see the German annihilated. It
will bring, if necessary, hundreds of thou-
sands more. And the impulse prompting all
ot them will be a wild horror of “the ideal
German methods for handling the native
races” which Metcalfe longs for.
The first Australian aviator has given
his life in the Basil Ash,
born at Southport (Q.), while his father
was Anglican rector there 24 years ago. Ash
was gazetted flight-lieutenant in the naval
Aving of the Royal Flying Corps some nine
months ago, and with a comrade set out in
a seaplane on a scouting expedition from
the Orkneys. The machine was afterwards
picked up far out to sea in a damaged con-
dition, but no trace of either aviator was
found.
Ilulton Sams, who combined soul-salving
with amateur boxing in the Queensland
backblocks, has got a commission in the
Duke of Cornwall’s Light Infantry. A
humorous feature of the case is that, while
lie was here, the wowsers freely accused him
of a lack of Imperial loyalty on account of
his enthusiasm for Australian defence, and
more particularly the navy.
“North Queenslander”: In reporting the
Huddy workers’ compensation case, which
has been before the Courts for a couple of
years, all the southern papers report that
the miner who made the astonishing recovery
was mended at the Cloncurry Hospital. It’s
a ; fair thing to say that the astonishing job
was done at the Friezland (Hampden) Hos-
pital. The doctor there at the time was
James Hunter, now at Gosford (N.S.W,).
The Little Garden.
[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
The city is mine—the streets and streets,
Crooked lanes by a twinkling sea,
Smell of the tarry ropes and brine,
Sunlit square, and clock tower — mine....
And the Avind.ow’s witchery.
Windows! How they glitter and sparkle,
The goAvns behind them! What shimmer
and shine!
Where are the women to wear so many?
And I can choose the finest of any
To fashion myself more fine!
The city is mine I have gold to buy it!
Noisy music that bangs and thrums,
Picture galleries and painted faces,
Stately mansions and modish places
And caf6s and lanes and slums.
The city is mine. After all the longing
I pace its highways with restless feet,
And a sheeted thought shall sue for pardon
That I remember a green old garden
With lavender bushes sweet.
Do penance, you foolish thought! Take
candle
• And walk barefoot to some tear-stained
shrine
To make a jest for the gay and witty;
How dare you come to the splendid city
To sorrow this heart of mine !
Miles and miles of stone and railing,
Acres of park set prim and square,
Thin clock tower and shining steeple,
And, oh ! the terrible hosts of people!
Faces—and everywhere!
There were only" ourselves in the little
garden.
A whiff of Spring in the bee-filled air,
And I wore a clumsy winsey gown,
But a red rose petal came drifting down
And lay like a jewel there.
You in your shirt sleeves, spade in hand,
Shabby and brown and glad and shy.
Why can’t you look in the old, old way?
Or is it only, since yesterday,
That happiness goes so high?
QUEENSLAND.
M. FORREST.
QUEENSLAND GOSSIP.
Brisbane, January 16, 1915.
My Dear Tiiargomindaii,—
The engagement ring is one of the most
common of our great natural resources just
now. Amongst others amassing satisfactory
results from it are little Miss Norma Wil-
kinson (who is that rare combination, a
Bachelor of Arts and a Master of Frocking)
and a mere man named Sachs. Likewise
Connie Bouchard, the fair-haired daughter
of .-the South Brisbane M.L.A., has listened
to the persuasive eloquence of a Beenleigh
resident named Petersen. Matrimony also
threatens to take from us our one feminine
LL.B. —Irene Winifred Paten —just after
we had been reading of her successful
appearance in blue crepe de chine when the
Victorian Bar announced its perfect willing-
ness to have her take a seat and join the
Costs banquet. Queensland does not want
the lady, lawyer, and rudely chases her away.
Victoria is more diplomatic.
The Paten family included a quartette of
clever sisters. One of them, Lilian, is an
authoress. Her book, “Frances of the Farm,”
is quite widely distributed. A third sister
is a nurse with, the first Expeditionary Force,
and a fourth is a successful masseuse who
has taken up globe-trotting as a sideline.
The news of the death of Mrs. Alex.
McNab was not' altogether unexpected. The
gentle-voiced lady had only* just returned
from a trip around the world when she was
stricken with the fatal illness. She had a
tactful and happy personality, and the young
folk will miss a sympathetic friend and an
indulgent hostess.
All arrangements having been made,
Dudley McNab was married to Jean Tait
last Saturday; but in consequence of his
mother’s illness there was no fuss. Only
the members of the two families were pre-
sent. This was the second marriage in the
Tait family, of Toowong, within a few days,
that of son Archie having, taken place in
Sydney. He and his wife have since
returned to Toowoomba, where he directs
the Tait interests on the Downs.
Surveyor-General Spowers will lose a
daughter on January 27, Macaulay Turner
being the pirate. Cousin Hilda Love pro-
vided joy-tea to a number of girl friends
this week by way of celebration. ■
On Monday Harry Scales, of the
“Dandies,” married Miss Maisie Redgrave.
Mr. and Mrs. Claude Dampier were acces-
sories before and after the fact, the former
saying “I do” when the tradesman asked
“Who giveth away this woman?” and the
latter presiding over the reception champagne
in a frock and hat which moved covetous-
ness to quiver in its hidden lair. The bride-
groom and his support were in white flannels,
and this sensibleness earned them more
attention than is usually wasted on super-
numeraries. Another item of interest about
the newly-branded husband is that he was
at one time trumpeter to Kitchener.
The refreshment served in Mabel Wool-
cock’s honor is causing the local trade to
boom and shout joyously. Mrs. William
Ahles and Miss Fitzgerald have been the
latest hostesses. The latter hurried her
friends along to a theatre party and supper.
The hand of congratulation is being
extended to Dr. Ernest Martin, who
returned this week after getting to close
quarters with German culture in a concen-
tration camp. Anxiety as to his wife’s
safety and the hard manual labor required
of prisoners (there’s no Hotel Daniell for
prisoners of Avar in Hogmany) took heavy
toll of his health, and he has returned weigh-
ing 2st. less than when he left. His wife
was pretty Nina Walker, a sister of Mrs.
Espie Dods.
Lena Hammond, our best contralto, should
be in Sydney ere this. Lena’s voice is much
in demand from the Towers to the border,
and her concert engagements have been so
many that a rest is necessary before she
warbles at Gympie in March.
Arnold Weinholt, who was rejected by
the Wide Bay electors in favor of Andrew
Fisher, has been hunting in S’Africa. Know-
ing the country well, he offered the South
African Government to guide a party into
German Africa on a foraging or punitive
expedition or something. But the offer was
declined. Then he said in effect: “Oh, dash
the expense; I’ll foot the bill.” But the
cold eye came his way again. So he is
sailing home. Home has its advantages at
times.
Yours affectionately,
AUSTRALIA JANE.
Hydraulic-engineer Henderson is taking
his hat down from the office-peg for the last
time, after supervising the sinking of more
artesian bores than any other man in Aus-
tralia, and incidentally earning the undying
enmity of numerous graziers, against whose
buccaneering tendencies he has continually
defended. State interests. It cannot be said
that he is retiring for “age reasons,” for no
Ministry has ever been able to ascertain
how far behind or before him lies the fatal
three-score years and ten, and the mysterious
Scot has no exact information on the ques-
tion. In him, anyhow, the Queensland
Public Service loses a fine, weather-beaten
landmark.

A. W. Appleford: Your
the single man must “fight, starve or marry” (which'
presumably means that he is to loaf while his wife
takes in washing) is unutterable ‘degradation in this
country of “unlimited natural resources” (the re-
sources which we borrow all the money on). It is
possible to get a decent tariff ; to stop £20,000,000
or £30,000,000 worth per annum of the cheap-labqr
imports that are paid for out of loans ; and to supply
honest local employment. What is the good of
being a country of boundless natural resources if our
wives have to take in washing while we buy slop
clothes made in Germany ?... .A. ITowe: You say:
“For goodness sake, do, in this war, as you did so
finely in the Boer war —stand for the honest and
the chivalrous thing, for which I loved the paper.”
We are doing it. Britain assailed a little nation 15
years ago, and though the agga-ult was almost benevo-
lent by comparison with Germany’s performances in
Belgium, The Bulletin did the ‘ honest and the
chivalrous thing, and attacked the attacker. There
is hardly a pro-Boer outside Germany who isn't an
anti-German to-day. Get on to the right side of
the fence... .O’Phimerty: “Concertina” doesn’t
rhyme with “gleaner,” nor “meaner,” nor “keener,”
nor even with “leaner.” Give the instrument a

“Billy Blue”: Apropos of Parson Mars-
den’s readiness with the whip (B. 31/12/’l4),
his grandson, the late Itev. J. S. Hassall, has
placed on record a story. Marsden once
called at a farm on the Hawkesbury River,
and inquired how the wife, whom he had
married to her husband, out of “the factory”
{the convict women’s workrooms), was get-
ting on. The husband said she was “no good,”
and wouldn’t work ; whereupon Marsden took
his gig-wliip and gave her a thrashing, and
added the warning that, if she didn’t behave
better he would have her returned to “the fac-
tory” when he next came that way. Months
after, when the parson called again, the man
told him that from that day his wife had
turned over a new leaf, and now there
couldn’t be a better one anywhere.
John Sands’ 19.15 Directory of N. S. Wales
weighs 81b., and if it were sirloin it would
be worth 7s. But no one can .blame the
country—-which, of course, means everything
out of Sydney. For while Sydney has added
50 pages this year, the rest puts on only an
extra 14 pages. In the Sydney section there
are now 284 columns of Smiths ; of Browns,
18 cols.; of Williamses, 17 ; of Joneses, 124 ;
of Johnstons, 12; of Thompsons, 114; of
Wilson, 104; of Whites, 94; of Walkers,
8|; and of Thomases. 74- In the. color sec-
tion Brown taps the list, with White second.
After that come Green, 54 columns; Gray,
44 ; Black, 2 ; and there are a dozeh Blues
and five Pinks. Cohen fills 24 cols., -but
Moses is squeezed into half a column, which
is another injustice to Ireland.

Affected Head, Wrists and Ankles.
Soon a Scaly Rash, Two Tins of
Cuticura Ointment Cured.
Mooroopna, Vic. —“I was suffering from
an attack of eczema for about one month.
The eczema affected my head, wrists and
ankles and the itching was horrible. I
could not get a good night’s sleep for more
than a week, and soon it came out on the
parts mentioned above in a scaly rash. I
tried other ointments for a time but they
did not seem to do me any good. I saw the
Cuticura Remedies advertised, and thought
I would try the Cuticura Ointment, which
I bought and applied as directed, and I am
glad to say it has completely cured mo after
using two tins.” (Signed) F. Chadaneau,
November 23, 1912.
SEVERELY BURN f ON FOREHEAD
Wonnerup, West Australia.—“ My daugh-
ter was severely burnt on forehead and arm,

tensely irritating. She was treated for two
months and every time the burns were
dressed the skin came away. I brought her
home and using Cuticura Ointment for
anointing, and Cuticura Soap for bathing,
as directed, it has entirely renewed the parts
affected.
‘ ‘Another daughter also hurt her knee when
skating. She also could not get relief until
she applied Cuticura Ointment, and I hope
always to keep it available.” (Signed) Mrs.
J. B. O’Leary, November, 1912.

AN/EMIA
and Debility
IF you are run-down, easily exhausted and out
* of breath—if you feel slack, depressed, or
“out-of-sorts,” start a Course of Iron
‘Jelloids’ at once. Iron ‘ Jelloids ’ are the
finest and most reliable tonic for all cases of
Anaemia or Debility. They quickly restore
vitality, and produce the rich healthy blood so
essential to good health and vigour. Iron
‘Jelloids’ are a perfectly safe remedy under
all conditions —pleasant, inexpensive, do not
harm the teeth, and are non-constipating.
Dr. Andrew Wilson wrote:—
“It can be definitely stated that Iron ‘Jelloids’
constitute the most effective and desirable
treatment for the cure of that common com-
plaint, that insidious and weakening condition,
no matter from what cause arising, known
as Anaemia or Poorness of Blood.”

A fortnight's trial (Price 1/6) will convince you

should rule their choice, since Fashion recog-
nises their dress value and insists that they shall
harmonise with the rest of one’s attire. Thus, by
following the lead of Fashion, a very distinctive

More Harmsworth enterprise. The
French “Yellow Book,” giving all the inner
history of the 10 days preceding the out-
break of war, appeared simultaneously in
France as an official document and in Eng-
land as a two,-shilling volume published
from the office- of the Times. On the front
page of the original French publication it
is announced on the authority of the French
Foreign Office that “all rights in the English
language for all countries have been as-
signed to the Times.” So that in the strict
letter of copyright law not a single quota-
tion from the English volume could legally
be made by anybody—not even by the Brit-
ish and American Governments —without
the permission of the Times. However, it
doesn’t matter much. Wholesale cuttings
were promptly commandeered by all the
other papers, and the Ilarmsworths didn’t’
warn them off the grass.

“J.F.H.”: London Times has been cele-
brating a centenary. It. was on November
29, 1814, that a steam-driven printing
machine, invented by a foreigner, Freidrich
Konig, got a-going in its office. Ivonig on
coming to London found a good and profit-
able patron in John Walter 11., the then
chief proprietor of the Times, who had for
some time been cogitating how he could
accelerate the production of the paper.
Taken with Ivonig’s theories he gave him
every encouragement, and finally started
steam-printing in spite of strong opposition
and the objections of a variety of assorted
cranks who considered steam-printing “fly-
ing in the face of Providence.” It was this
John Walter 11. who also invented the lead-
ing article. Previously papers had confined
themselves to the provision of news, and
had not regarded themselves as purveyors
of opinions.
* * * *
“Jermyn Street”: “Pitcher,” formerly of
London Pink ’Un and latterly of Town
Topics, is dead. A while ago John Corlette
sold the Pink ’Un to de Wend Fenton for
£30,000. Fenton naturally understood that
he would take over the staff. lie was so
certain of this, and Corlette was such a
genial old gentleman, that he omitted to get
it put into writing. Immediately the cash
had passed the staff resigned. As one of
them chuckled to me, “He’s got the cage,
but all the bloomin’ singin’ birds are gone.”
Nobody ever had two opinions about the
morality of it, but somehow no one seemed
sorry for Fenton. The absconding staff
issued Town Topics, and in such an imita-
tive “get up” of the Pink ’Un that Fenton
started Chancery proceedings, and the
Topics changed its form. It is a testimony
to the durability of the “institution” and
the value of a name in Anglo-Saxondom that
even the migration of the “singing birds”
didn’t shake the power of the Pink ’Un.
Its reptile counterpart lags far behind it.
“Pitcher’s” successor in the editorship of
Town Topics is Colonel Newnliam-Davis,
who is supposed to know more about dinners
and suppers than any other man in London.
“Hamer”: From Sydney Evening News
(2/1/T5) : —-
Miss Wynne, 17, was shot dead at her home at
Toolern, Victoria, on Friday, with a shotgun. An
Italian whom it is said fired the shot turned the
weapon on himself. The top of the girl’s head was
blown off.
That represents about the limit in bad
shooting.

A curious protest has been started by
certain wowserish shareholders of London
Times against the Sunday war edition,
which they call “an innovation without pre-
cedent in the history of the paper, and a
new departure in English daily journalism.”
Furthermore, it - is “a distinct breach of
the laws of God,” and the “greatest curse
of the United States” —where, by the way.
the seven-day journal had its origin in the
Civil War. Finally they call on Lord North-
cliffe to “withdraw the Sunday edition
whether it pays or not” —and of course con-
tinue the Monday morning edition, which
involves about five times more Sabbath labor.
“T. 0.1.” : The recent death of one of the
Bathurst (N.S.W.) Muttons at an advanced
age recalls an exploit of the more or less
famous Lick Thatcher. Forty years ago
the Western Independent, of Bathurst,
was owned and edited by a Scot named Rae.
He wanted a holiday and engaged the
racketty Bohemian to be editor pro tem.
Somehow while Rae was absent the head of
the Muttons came into notoriety, which
caused Thatcher to paragraph him. The
chances are Dick had never seen his victim;
so when he spoke about tears chasing each
other down Mr. Mutton’s classic nose, how
was he to know that Mr. Mutton had no
nose? A suit for libel followed, and natu-
rally enough the verdict was against the
newspaper, damages being assessed at £2OO.

Mary Gaunt’s new book is to be called
“A Woman in China.” It is to be published

A new form of book-booming this.
THE MISSING LETTERS.
[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
I search my paper for a single par.
Above those pen-names which should now be flitting
Across each page, since Courts and Houses are
Not sitting.
Alas! the voice of “Worker’s Wife’’ is still;
“Mother of Ten,” his weary round to vary,
Has now become an expert on things mil-
itary.
Silent the scribe who wields a weighty pen
In exposition of the laws of Moses ;
And readers are not asked to name their ten
Pet roses.
The bores of yesterday are put to rout,
With their array of figures, facts and fables;
Each space-devouring blackleg’s crowded out
By cables.
Some thanks, at least, we owe to Potsdam Bill;
Though talk of German culture sounds like treason,
To it is due the absence of the sil-
Ly season!

The Suffering and Pain Endured by Many Women
is Almost Beyond Belief.
T'HERE are thousands of Australian Women whose duties call them out in all
weathers, often to sit with wet feet or stand all day, thus undermining their
health. Many women, however, spend their lives at home, and these are
ambitious that their homes should be kept neat and clean, their children well
dressed and tidy, and they often do their own housework and sewing for the entire
family. Truly, the work of such women “is never done,’’ and is it any wonder that
she breaks down at the end of a few years—the back aches, there is a general
depression, and the struggle to continue her duties is pitiful? The reason is that
the kidneys are not doing their duty. If they were, the blood would be kept pure
and would nourish the whole body; but, if the kidneys are inactive, the blood
carries pain and disease throughout the
system. Dr. Sheldon’s Gin Pills are the
great corrective for all Kidney ills, and in
making the Kidneys well will soon remove
such symptoms as Backache, Headache,
Nervous Depression, Dragging Pains, Sleep-
lessness, Lassitude and other distressing ail-
ments which women are so often subject to.
Diseased Kidneys & Gravel.
“I have good cause to be
grateful to Dr. Sheldon’s Q n
Pills,” writes Mrs. M. Moore,
The Avenue, Croydon, N.S.W.
‘‘l suffered from diseased kid-
neys and gravel for the past
two years. I got so bad that I
had to lay up for two weeks,
my back was so painful. I could
not sleep for the burning feeling
all over me. To do my work was
out of the question. I was really
helpless. I tried numerous medicines,
and wore a plaster for months, and I have
been under two doctors ; but they all failed to
give me any relief. One day I went to the
chemist’s to get something to give me a little re-
lief, when I saw Dr. Sheldon’s Gin Pills in the window.
Being a new pill, I thought 1 would give them a trial. 1
bought a bottle, and after taking the contents ! felt greatly
relieved. They are far better than all the doctors and medicines
put together. I took ti e pills for three months, and after that
fme I felt a new worn; n, and have not hcd a pain or an ache since.”
Dr Sheldon’s Gin Pills are procurable at all chemists and storekeepers in two
size glass containers. Small size at 1/6, large size at 2/0, or six bottles of the
large size for 13/0. Or, if not obtainable locally, will be sent post free upon receipt
of price in stamps or postal note by Sheldon Drug Co., Ltd., lo O Connell Street,

Young Kings and Old.
[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
Young King fights in the trenches
I and the Old King fights in the rear —
Because he is old and feeble, and not
for a thought of fear.
The Young King fights for the Future, and
the Old King fights for the Past —
The Young King is fighting his first fight
and the Old King is fighting his last.
It is ever the same old battle, be the end of
it Beer or 8100d —
Or whether the rifles rattle, or whether a
friend flings mud - ;
Or a foe to the rescue dashes, and the touch
of a stranger thrills —
Or the Truth —or the bayonet flashes; or
the Lie —or a bullet kills.
The young man strives to determine which
are the truths or lies,
And the old man preaches his sermon —and
he takes to his bed and dies ;
And the parson is there, and the nurse is
(or the bread is there and the wine)' —
And the son of the minister curses as he
dies in the firing line.
And ever, and ever, and ever, as it was in
ages untold,
The Women grow still more “clever,” and
the young know more than the old ;
Till the seer on the hill cries “Treason !”
and the witch grins out of her hole —
And a clarion voice shouts “Reason”!—-
and the Drums of Destruction roll.
The young bard bounds to the office, with
eyes and with cheeks a-gloW,
And he meets the old on the stairway, with
tottering knees and slow.
And ever the Cowards of Conscience, or
Envy, or Greed —or Trade
Are forcing Us back from Antwerp, or forc-
ing us back from Belgrade.
But courage! By hut or steeple!— and
courage for old and young 1
No song for the sullen people has ever been
left Unsuhg!
And the Crudest note that wdS worthy has
. never gone by unfeit—-
I shall die in peace by the Danube, while
you shall sing by the Scheldt!
N.s.w.
HENRY LAWSON.
On a Dry Track.
[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
ONE fine day in October I set out from
Merrivale (which lies nearabouts
between the head waters of the Daw-
son and Maranoa rivers) for the Warrego.
At first I strapped my swag in front of me,
but Brownie, the plodding old moke I be-
strode, was so long, and there was so much
superfluous space bellihd, that a pack in
front made us look ridiculous. So I stuffed
everything into a wallet (a bag sewn at
both ends, with a slit in the middle), and
threw it across his loins,
I had been compelled to swap a good
hack-—which had gone lanie and got dog
poor—for him at a scalper’s camp near
Merrivale. He was a big brown animal
with a tremendous hollow in the back of
him. He had the head and hoofs of a cart-
horse, and had been young in the days when
I was going to school. He looked sorry, as
though he had some great family affliction
on his mind. He wasn’t a quadruped that
one could take a pride in, or become fond of.
He was too ill-shapen for that; and no
amount of grooming would make him look
even decently dressed. The only way to
improve an angular beast like him was with
a squaring axe. There was nothing vicious
about him. He was so quiet that it was
impossible to frighten him. He was a great
horse to meditate. He Would stand under a
tree and meditate for hours. He had two
good points—according to his last owner —
inasmuch as he was a weight-carrier and a
good camper.
I reached Womblebank that afternoon, and
next day headed for Tooloombilla, twelve
miles distant. Hitherto I had been travers-
ing country where one had no need to bother
much about waterbags, and I had got into
careless habits. In ordinary seasons the
Dawson-Warrego region was good country.
One could take almost any track with safety
without inquiring about the location of the
next waterliole. But this was an unusual
season.
I lunched on the bank of a creek within
one mile of Tooloombilla homestead —with-
out knowing it. Went on through a scrub,
across a couple of rough ridges, and down
a flat traversed by a long dry gully. I knew
now I had passed the squattage, and went
on in hopes of reaching Forestvale, or find-
ing water. Followed that gully for twenty
miles, and continued following it till long
after dark, walking along the bed, half-lead-
ing, half-dragging my unwilling horse. Let
him go at last, and went to sleep under a
tree, supperless and full dressed. I did not
trouble to light a fire, and that camp was
as lonely and cheerless as ever a traveller
experienced. In the silence of the night I
heard a snake glide by through the long
grass, but it did not disturb me. I only
wondered if the reptile knew of a beautiful
pool somewhere and was going for a drink.
I got up before dawn, feeling feverish, and
horse-hunted _by starlight. There is one
benefit in going to bed with your clothes on
—you lose no time dressing in the morn-
ing. Continued down the gully till I came
to a road running at right angles into a
paddock. Followed it to the foot of a hill.
There I pulled up and considered what
course to take. The abrupt rise in the land
didn’t please me, and I was about to turn
away from the hill when I heard a dog bark
on the other side.
Riding to the top. I saw a selector’s
house and sheds in a little valley that was
almost wholly surrounded by steep hills. I
hurried down, and soon impressed that selec-
tor with tire magnitude of my thirst. Three
times he filled a pannikin, and three times
I drained it. I could have enjoyed a little
drop more, but he looked at me so hard the
third time that I asked for a drink for the
horse instead. There was a boggy spring
in a little paddock near the house, and while
Brownie refreshed himself in a trickling
stream, I dropped on my hands and knees
(behind a bush where the selector couldn’t
see me), and had another good swig.
After loosening my belt a couple of holes
I rode back to the house. I was at Clara-
vale, 35 miles from Mitchell and 20 from
Tooloombilla “by the short cut.” By way
of consolation I was informed that “lots of
people” took the wrong turn near the latter
place, and one unfortunate had perished a
few days before on the track I had come.
I was invited to breakfast. Though I
had fasted for twenty-two hours, the hot
scones and butter did not appeal to me. The
teapot did. I emptied it twice.
The whole family was impressed by this
time.
“You’re not eating much?” the selector
remarked kindly.
“Perhaps the poor man can’t,” his wife
said, eyeing the expansible part of my
anatomy. “Would you like another pot of
tea?”
It may have been a slip; hitherto she
had asked me if I would like another cup.
I got ashamed of that thirst; it didn’t seem
respectable.
I hurried to Ivilmoree, over six miles of
scrubby hills, assuaged some more of it at
an iron tank, and inquired about the next
drink. It was ten miles away—in a fenced-
in hole 10ft. by 6ft., and only eight inches
deep. By the time I reached it the sun heat
was insufferable. The water was black and
green, and alive with insects. Two dead
cows lay half-buried on one side, and a dog
lingered just out of the water on the other.
The odor of that hole was a power in the
land; but anything wet just then was not
to be passed with contumely. I dipped a
billyful with the pannikin, put hot charcoal
in it, boiled it, skimmed it, strained it, and
made strong tea. It was hard to take.
Jogged along on to the creek at Tooloom-
billa. Delicious, limpid water flowing with
the sparkle of champagne! I embraced it
with the ecstasy of a sportive frog, while
Brownie pumped it into him till he breathed
With difficulty. I was worried about his
health. He. looked bad.
After letting him go I went down to the
hole to have a bath. All the liquid I con-
sumed seemed to evaporate within a few
minutes. The best remedy for that was a
good soak. I was soaking accordingly in a
sheltered nook when I heard voices at the
crossing. I kept quiet, thinking the owners
would soon pass on. Presently, however,
there was a splash, and the next instant a
lady of middle age who had forgotten her
bathing costume bobbed up alongside of me.
She and her companion—who was younger
and plumper—belonged to the homestead.
I don’t know if she screamed or said any-
thing ; I dived promptly and did not come
up till I had got round the bend. When I
returned for my clothes, half an hour after-
wards. they had disappeared—the women,
not the clothes,
I rose with the sun next morning and had
a drink. Pretty well recovered by this time.
But Brownie appeared to have suffered a
relapse during the night, and took some per-
suading to get a move oil. Nobody at the
homestead except women, who eyed me
with ail aggressive Interest. They didn’t
smoke, So for the first time I took to smok-
ing tea, having run out of the comforting
weed. It is a smoke that makes bad tobacco
a delight and a joy for ever by comparison.
Tea is a common substitute for tobacco
on the track. Dry bark and leaves are also
used, and I once saw a swagman smoking
something else about which I will not go
into particulars. “First rate for cigarette
blokes,” he remarked, “but too mild for
me.”
Struck the Maranoa at sundown. Being
tired of smoking tea, I went forth on a
tobacco hunt after dark. Found three men
in the hut at Forestvale. One was cutting
the bottom off a bottle to make a lamp
globe, and didn’t speak; the second was
washing a pair of pants in a bucket, and
looked sulky; the third had a white shirt
spread out on a gin case, and was busily
smoothing it with a heated stirrup-iron.
This party resented my mentioning tobacco.
It seemed he was making heroic efforts to give
up the filthy habit to please the housemaid,
who had announced that she would never
marry a man who smoked. It also trans-
pired that the other two had recently buried
their pipes, which accounted for the un-
sociable humor they were in.
10 p.m.: Quiet night in the cypress pine.
Much concerned about the tobacco industry.
Brownie indisposed.
In the morning I had the honor of meet-
ing Manager Lethbridge, who inquired if I
wanted a good cattle-dog. I was suspicious.
“What’s the matter with him?” I asked.
“Well, he’s a bit too fond of poultry for
me,” was the reply. “He was left here
alone, with nothing to eat, and he took to
killing the fowls. Now we can’t break him
off it.” „
I didn’t carry fowls, so a little defect
like that would not matter if his general
appearance was satisfactory. There'are dogs
that a respectable man would be ashamed
to be seen with.
The owner whistled and called to the
miscreant, but the miscreant didn’t come.
He had come before and got hammered.
So we went in search of him round the
house, and the store and the kitchen,
assisted by the cook and the housemaid
and the blackboy. The housemaid was a
dear little confection in striped pink, and I
hoped we would be a long time finding that
dog. I searched assiduously in her vicinity,
and did all the stooping for her whenever
she seemed to think he was under anything.
It ended before we had got off the weather
topic. The poor wanderer in a lonesome
land has few chances of enjoying the smiles
of pretty Eva. Even a domestic dog-hunt
proves disappointing.
We found the poultry-slayer under the
wood-heap, playing with a frog. I was
favorably impresse'd at once. A dog that
could find amusement in frogs was as good
a brute companion as a man could have on
the track. He was a white dog with floppy
ears. I held him while the manager hunted

When a Woman has Backache, Headache, Rheumatic Twinges,
Urinary Trouble; when she has Aching L.mbs and Swollen Joints,
WEAK KIDNEYS ARE THE CAUSE.
A woman has more than her share of burdens in life.
The care of the house, the needs of the family, the making
and mending —and constant anxiety for everybody round—
except herself.
It is not surprising that women are subject to kidney
weakness—their kidneys cannot stand the strain that’s forced
upon them.
Backache from morn till night, worn and. tired before
mid-day with headache, dizziness —to stoop is painful, and to
rise again is torture.
Sallowness, weak heart, sleeplessness, sciatica, rheuma-
tism, dropsy, gravel, stone are outcomes of diseased and tired
kidneys.
Doan’s Backache Kidney Pills act diredtly upon the
kidneys they help them to filter the blood —to take out the
uric acid and impurities that cause the aching back— they
give relief in cases of dropsy, heart palpitation, neuralgia,
lumbago, rheumatism, sciatica, stone, gravel and all urinary
ailments.
SYDNEY WOMAN CURED.
Mrs. W. J. H. Richards, 16 Cook Road, Marrickville says: “For
about seven years I was a martyr to kidney trouble, and only those w o
have suffered in this way have any idea what I went through. i J
hack used to often ache so much that it felt like breaking, and eve .
movement was positive torture. When the pains were _ very _ seveie
was impossible for me to stoop, and I was almost crippled. ■
symptoms of kidney trouble were dropsical swellings on my legs
ankles, and disordered secretions. During the time I suffered i w >
treated by doctors and others, but they failed to do me any good. - "
six months ago'Doan’s Backache Kidney Pills were brought line ei y
notice, so I made up my mind to give them a fair trial. Alter u *
the first, bottle I realised I had at last got a medicine that was benenting
me, so I continued taking the pills until I was quite cured, using 1
six bottles.” , „ T , . ,
Two years later Mrs. Richards confirms the above: I have had no
trouble with my kidneys since Doan’s Backache Kidney 1 ul& eIU( „
over two years ago—a fact that speaks well for this splendid reined y.
Doan’s Backache Kidney Pills are sold by all Chemists and
keepers at 2s. 9d. per bottle, or will be posted on receipt of price y

A Lasting Cure by

Mrs. G. Gavin, 57 Briggs Street, Camperdown, says: ‘ Three y

or
up a greenhide rope. He poised first on
one leg. then on the other, and scratched
himself with great vigor the whole time.
So I called him “Scratclier.”
With this new asset in tow I took a
short cut across the deep sandy bed of the
Maranoa, and continued, my itinerary.
The little activitv Brownie had started
with was becoming exhausted. I damaged
a lot of switches on him without any notice-
able effect. Then I got a stout waddy. This
made a deal of noise when it landed about
his rib parts, but made no difference in Ins
pace. I was glad I wasn’t meeting any-
Scratcher kept me interested. I fastened
the rope to the stirrup-iron, _ thinking he
would trot alongside. _ But it was a hot
morning, and as Brownie followed the wind-
ings of the road he threw his scant shadow
all over the place. Scratclier tried to
follow it, and when he wasn’t tangled
round Brownie’s front legs lie was half-
strangled and howling among his hind ones.
Once he sat down midway between the four
to scratch himself. Brownie planted a hoof
on his tail and things happened. Scratclier
bit the offending hoof, and Brownie kicked
up—slinging me and the \vallet on to the
road. I had been looking down at
Scratclier.
While I was getting on, the dog took a
couple of turns round those hind legs again.
I didn’t notice it, and tried to start Brownie
with the waddy. But he was hobbled with
too much dog, and landed on his nose. He
stood, and, looking back, stamped his foot
and snorted. It was the best attempt he
could make at swearing, I dismounted about
fourteen times per mile to disentangle that
dog.
Twelve miles landed us at I ossession
Creek. There was no feed, but plenty of
water. That was mostly the way. Where
water was plentiful there was no grass, and
vice versa. In that sort of country old
hands watered their horses late in the after-
noon, then rode on to the grass. One needed
a waterbag to do that. I hadn’t raised a
waterbag yet, having vegetated in a wet
part. Another thing, I felt lonely and lost
if I camped away from a waterhole or a
creek. Water and fire in conjunction repre-
sented home. I was used to those elements,
and could not' dissociate them from night.
My camping place turned out to be densely
populated with ants. The ground was liter-
ally alive with them. They swarmed on to
my bed, dived under the blankets, crawled
up under my trousers and shirt, and drove
me frantic. I got up and burnt the ground
all round me. In the comparative peace
that followed I lay under a glory of stars,
smoking delicious tobacco. Scratclier was
tied up close by. He jumped up hurriedly
at times, and whirled round after his tail
u at a tremendous rate. Their he would sit
down and scratch himself with despera-
tion. He passed a restless night.
Brownie was a disreputable animal next
morning. Examined him carefully, felt his
pulse, and sounded him—sounded hollow:
but couldn’t decide about the diagnostics.
He was very despondent. His heavy sighs
cat times and languid optics suggested melan-
cholia with complications. I had no anti-
dote for melancholia. Tried riding him;
it was harder than walking Digging my
heels into him was useless; it only made
him grunt. He never was a Cup winner,
but latterly his pace was nearly at a stand-
still. Got off and drove him, leading the
dog. It came out very hot, and Scratcher
felt it severely. He tried to travel side-
ways to keep all of him in the thin shadow
I threw across the road.
I carried a pickle-bottle of water in the
wallet. This got lukewarm, and was con-
sequently useless except to moisten the lips.
Old Brownie was everlastingly looking for
a camping place. When he wasn’t turning
off at one side he was sidling away on the
other. If I touched him on the jaw with
the stick 'to put him straight he turned delib-
erately and methodically round and started
back the other way. Loss of memory was
another symptom.
Camped near a small squattage of un-
pretentious appearance. An old man with
two horses, bound for Tambo, was just leav-
ing the waterhole for the homestead. His
horses were in splendid condition. He fed
them on damper, which, he said, was very
fattening. A small damper would do a
horse all day, and keep him sleek and
spirited. He had given his nags. the last
bit, and had to go oh for more rations. He
inspected Brownie, and was positive the
beast’s complaint was dropsy.
A visit to the homestead occupied a con-
siderable portion of the following day. Not
that there were any sights to see. A young
girl in a short dress was in the kitchen.
She informed me that the missus would be
out in a few minutes. Waited two hours,
and sent the girl in again. Same reply.
Waited another hour, and commissioned the
little maid again to refresh her memory.
Brought word that the missus would see me
at the front. Found her nursing a baby and
admiring the scenery.
I wanted to replenish my meat supply.
“There’s no one here to attend to you,”
she said with much vituperative snap. “Eve
got my children to mind.”
I joined her in studying the landscape,
and took an interest in the frolics of the
baby. After a while she relented.
“Will vou hold my baby for a minute?”
I took the cherub and marched off with
him to the meat-house. I was delighted with
that little bundle of humanity, and dandled
it about until she appeared with a bunch of
keys.
“It’s threepence a pound,” she said, lift-
ing a huge junk from the cask. “How much
do you want?”
The price staggered me. It was more
than double the usual charge in that part;
and my current cash had dwindled to four-
pence—which was in postage stamps. I
coughed behind my hand to hide my blushes.
“Er —one pound,” I said, avoiding her
gaze.
My gentle lady tried to keep back a smile,
and remarked : “A pound isn’t much.”
“It isn’t,” I admitted —“for thripence.”
She hacked off a lump and weighed it.
Being a quarter over the pound she cut a
slice off. I tendered a pair of twopenny
stamps.
“I haven’t a penny,” she said. “Will you
take the other piece of meat for the change?”
“Yes—if you cau spare it.”
She threw it on the bench without looking
at me.
I slunk by the kitchen, holding my pur-
chase so that the girl in the short dress
would not see it. .
I had left Scratclier tied up with Brownie
at the sliprails. When I returned I found
a station-hand squatting on his heels, with
his back against the post, patting him. He
was a good-natured, voluble sort of person,
who seemed to have had a lot of experience
with dogs. He spun dog yarns all the time
that it took me to strap up my meat and
readjust my pack.
“It’s a wonder you scored a bit of scrag
for them here,” he said finally. “It’s a
hungry hole this.”
Approaching a waterhole in the afternoon
Scratclier made a bound and broke the rope.
He plunged in, and there he stopped.
Whistled to him, called him “poor Scratclier”
and “poor old Scratclier,” and walked round
the hole coaxing him all I knew. But
Scratcher reckoned it was better in the water
than doing a perish after me. I rode on,
thinking he would follow later. But
Scratcher —the base deserter —went home.
Dark —and no water. Left Brownie under
a tree, and walked a mile down a dry
gully. Only found a much-dead cow. The
girl in the limited garment had told me of
water at a Twelve-mile YaM. Followed
another dry gully, looking for it; then cut
across a bight, and back on to the road.
Here the gully was running out, and before
me was a stony ridge. I gave it up and
camped.
Was gathering wood when I noticed some
dead cattle, evidently pulled out of a bog.
Inspected, and found the gully widened and
deepened the farther I went. Followed it
into the bight I had skipped, and there found
a long, deep hole of clear water. Hastened
after Brownie, and led him down to it.
Then I lit a fire with my last match, and
made a meal of salt junk and tea. Two
gins turned up just afterwards, and when
they had filled their billies they came back
and shared my camp fire.
We were travelling along the Hogan-
thulla, a tributary of the Warrego, when
Brownie knocked up. A swagman I met
said he had “wasting disease.” He had
certainly shrunk a good deal since we
started. I coaxed him and patted him, and
deplored my inability to make him under-
stand that “it was only a little farther to
the land of plenty.” We had crossed several
stages of grassless country, and a perish or
two had not improved matters; but five
miles ahead there were splendid grass and
flowing waters. I took the bridle and
pulled him, with the reins over my shoul-
der, till he wouldn’t come any more: pushed
and zigzagged him; then got on him by
way of giving his neck a spell. Bv dint of
hard riding, driving and dragging, I got him
within a mile of Killarney, and there let
him go. He did not go far, thou eh he fed
about for awhile as though he was enjoying
himself.
At dusk a cold drizzle set in, and this
affecting his weakened constitution he took
shelter under a tree. He was still there in
the morning, only he was lying down with
a straight neck. When I approached him
with the bridle, a gohanna crawled leisurely
away from his legs, and overhead the crows
were gathering.
There was no doubt as to what was the
matter with him now. He was dead.

Mullet Point.
[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
AT Mullet Point the nectarines are ripen-
ing in the sun,
While here I strive for place and pay
and comfort hardly-won.
The day is nearly done,
And the clouds draw close and weep
Upon the brown-clad valleys and the hills so
sere and steep.
But I know the blossoms keep
Dreaming gaily as they sleep
Near the orchard where from morn till eve
the sky’s a laughing blue,
And the wavelets ripple to
A melody exultant ame old glamor dances
through.
Oh, our hopes are mostly barren and the
times are out of joint,
But the sunset on the water coos delight to
Mullet Point.
At Mullet Point the tui sings and rosy hours
keep time
To the magic of the rhyme
Of his silver bells that chime.
There is purple in the shadows and the trees
are whispering green,
Aud there’s no abhorred intrusion of the
ugly might-have-been;
But the dear sea-swallows curvet o’er the
azure of the bay,
And the fantails in the manuka are insolent
and gay
As they flutter, flutter, flitter,
As they flash and frisk and titter.
Here life’s somehow hard and bitter,.
And the ashen shadows stay;
But the bees croon through the gold at Mullet
Point the livelong day.
This going back to collar seems a very dubi-
ous matter,
And the train’s insensate clatter
Sets one’s dearest dreams a-scatter;
So I feel like that old rufiian (whom you’ve
heard of, I dare say).
For the battle jars me rudely,
And the lance's pierce me shrewdly.
And although I dare the devil still I perish
in the fray.
Morn and night one’s face is ground
In the same unending round,
While the creditors and prowlers and the
prudes that peer and bawl
Do make cowards of us all,
Great and 5ma11....
Ah, the hopes that so uplift us, and the facts
all out of joint!
And the devils that betray!
And the faiths that slip away !....
But God comes close and genially smiles on
Mullet Point.
