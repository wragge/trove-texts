complete, 11s. 3d Columbus: Our opinion is
pretty well summed up in a recent Saturday
Review : “ America has produced a crowd of
accomplished versifiers, one or two imperfect
writers of verse in whom there is something of the
stuff of poetry (Emerson, for instance, whose
verse, by its intellectual quality, is unique in its
interest) and, in the final result, exactly one poet
and a-balf ; that is to say, Poe and Whitman.
Had Whitman possessed the ‘ faculty ’ as he
possessed the ‘ vision, it is difficult to soy how
great he might have been ; as ic is, he is a great
poetic force, but not, in the proper sense of the
term, a comp’ete poet. In Poo, on the other
hand, America has certainly produced a poet, and
a poet who, within his own range, was of unique
excellence, of consummate originality, and who
remains to this day, within his own range, unsur-
passed. ” Only we would give a little more credit
to Whitman, whose chaotic poe ry-stuff often im-
presses one more than the finished product.

SOME RECENT BOOKS.
The Story of a Modern Woman, by Ella
Hepworth Dixon (cloth, 4s), is some 12
months old, though it has only just reached
Australia. The book owes its (moderate)
interest to photographically minute ob-
servation, set forth with some descriptive
deftness. Ella doesn’t say laboriously
nasty things about the men ; but her
attack, though insidious, is just as vicious
as Sarah Grand’s. The story sharply con-
trasts modern men and women—the men
being without exception ugly, or foolish,
or depraved ; while the leading women are
types of high moral and intellectual excel-
lence, and good-looking into the bargain.
Occasionally a sentence strikes one —as
this :
I wonder if any man alive really knows how
dreadful it is to be a woman, and to have to
git down, and fold your hands, and wait.
Or this f
A woman, especially in her own house, should
always smile. It is on that acquiescent
feminine smile that the whole fabric of civilisa-
tion rests.
(The author is so pleased with this remark
that she says it all over again a few pages
further on ).
The Justification of Andrew Lebrun, by
Frank ,Barrett (cloth, 4s), is a stiffly-built
story about “arrested animation,” managed
by a manipulation of liquids which keeps
you, as it were, “on ice ” for 100 years or
so, when you are resuscitated by more
liquids. The development is awkward,
and the details lack verisimilitude.
The God in the Car, by Anthony Hope
(paper, 3s ; cloth, 4s), has average in-
terest, but no particular force or merit.
Willie, Huston, the hero, apparently
travesties Cecil Rhodes—a man of power,
“ the god in the car,” riding over human
lives in the path of African exploitation,
Huston’s intrigue with his friend’s wife
takes up most of the book : one wonders
if that is travesty too.
The Sphinx of Eaglehawk, by Rolf Boldre-
wood (cloth limp, 2s 3d), is a short tale of
life on old Bendigo bowdlerised to suit
respectable English families. The episodes
are familiar, and the author has described
them better before. By the way, London
Daily Chronicle’s notice of “ A Modern
Buccaneer ” —the best thing Rolf Boldre-
wood has done, &c.—is repeated in an
advertisement at the end of the volume.
No reference to the fact that Louis Becke’s
brains created that best thing. Rolf
Boldrewood is the Bayard of literature.
Wybert Reeve’s Theatrical Reminiscences
(paper, Is 4d) are reprinted under the
title, “From Life,” and are good, read-
able value for the money.
The Investigations of John Pyra, by David
Christie Murray (paper, Is 3d) are an
attempt by that hard-up shuttlecock of
letters to win the fame and fortune which
“ Sherlock Holmes” brought Conan Doyle.
The book will pass an hour or two plea-
santly.
Darwinism and Race Progress, by J. B.
Haycroft (cloth, 3s), is one of the most
interesting and valuable books that have
appeared in the “ Social Science Series.”
It insists strongly on the duty of indivi-
duals to the race, and ably discusses the
conditions of healthy life-building.
Isis Very Much Unveiled, by Edmund
Garrett (paper. Is 3d), is worth every
intelligent man’s perusal. It is a detailed
exposure of the bogus Mahatma of W. Q.
Judge, with special reference to the gulli-
bility of Annie Besant; and flutters the
theosophical dovecots so vigorously that
the doves must change into geese if they
wish to stay there longer.
The Yellow Book, Yol. IV. (cloth, 6s 9d), has
considerably more blue than green in its
composition. Almost every story deals
with sex-relationships, and there is nothing
so simply unabashed as “Theodora” in
recent literature. You read it
hurriedly with delightful little frissons, and
when you get to the end you sigh a little,
and smile a little, and read it carefully
over again. Next day you read it once
more, to make sure. Of course it is good.
Conventional people say it is immoral; but
it is neither moral nor immoral, it is
merely natural. The rest of the number
is written with brains —which is a great
comfort in these days of dullness. Space
unfortunately forbids quotation of many
interesting fragments. (Vols. I., II,, and
III. can also be had, 6s 9d each).


Medical.
THE “KEEPER" PILE PILL
(Registered).
The PROPRIETORS of these Pills are well aware that
there are many remedies (some of them really beneficial)
for this painful disease already in the market, hut know-
ing as they do the wonderful success of the “ KEEPER ”
PILL they have no hesitation in placing it in the very
front rank of Curative Medicines.
For years the medicine had only a local and limited
use, but now arrangements have been completed to make-
its merits more widely known, and the Australasian
colonies will have an opportunity of sharing with the old
country the benefits of this valuable remedy.
The medicine will be sold on its merits, in confident
assurance that its beneficent action will be a real boon to
sufferers.
It will not. cure Piles in old and chronic oases by a single
dose. It will not cure every disease that flesh is heir to,
but it will cure Piles if taken in reasonable time, and
IT WILL GIVE RELIEF IN ALL CASES,
however stubborn and chronic, and the proprietors are
continually in receipt of most flattering and unsolicited
testimonials. Price, 2 6 per box (red label).
The “KEEPER” LIVER PILL.
We constantly find cases of Hemorrhoids which are
complicated with liver trouble, and we have therefore
perfected a Liver Pill to be used alone, or in conjunction
with the “Keeper” Pile Pill. We do not claim tor this,
or for any of our preparations, any marvellous curative
properties. We simply advise you, if suffering from slug-
gish or torpid liver, to spend 1/3 in a box of “ KEEPER ’’
LIVER PILLS (blue label) and you will not regret it.
The “KEEPER” HEALTH PILL.
If you are worried in business, if you are jaded by over-
work, if you are generally run down from any cause, TRY
THIS PILL. It is a prince of pick-me-ups. In one size
only (brown label), 6 6 per box.
The title the “KEEPER” PILL is registered as our
trade mat k throughout the colonies, and any infringement
thereof will be promptly dealt with by the sole proprietors,

Gb R. Sims revives the tragic story of a
man convicted of murdering a policeman in Man-
chester, some 14 years ago. The evidence was
purely circumstantial, but absolutely crushing,
and the renowned Charley Peace, wearing blue
spectacles and a Quaker hat, came to hear sentence
of death passed. When the Judge said, “Hanged
by the neck till you be dead,” Peace —the real
murderer, as he afterwards admitted, with honest
pride—turned to a policeman standing beside him
and chuckled, “He richly deserves it!” The
prisoner was taken back to the place from whence
he came, and there he proceeded to go mad—so
awfully mad that the Law couldn’t with decency
hang him. He was removed to Broadmoor prison
as a criminal lunatic. In due course, Charley
Peace murdered one fellow-creature too many.
The nice, old musical gentleman had a bit of bad
luck with his last burglary, and he got sentenced
to death. When the game was clearly up, Peace
told the warders all about the Manchester murder
—how he heard the innocent man sentenced and
laughed when the fool went mad. Nothing was
done in the matter. Peace’s word was worthless,
even if they had put him into the dock to confess,
whilst the other man was incapable of explaining
anything again in tins world. So the innocent
victim of circumstantial evidence is still babbling
and raving the hours away at Broadmoor,

A BIG BIZ!
Our Trade is Big! Our Store is Big 1
Our Ideas are Bigl
We get bigger every day; on Saturday night
we are bigger than on the previous Monday,
and on the Wednesday following we are bigger
still. We can’t help growing. We have all the
elements of growth. The soil we are planted in
is good, the climate propitious, the people kind.
We are continually watered by the lifegiving
showers of a nation’s approval. Can anyone
wonder that we grow?
Our growth is a wonderful thing. People
describe it as magical. There is no magic in it.
Anyone, or any set of people, can do the same if
they do as we have done. But they don’t; they
can’t find the way, charge too much for the privi-
lege of doing business with them, and generally
and deplorably make a mess of the whole affair.
That’s the mischief.
Most People Like Us I All Believe in Usl
Not a Pew Swear by Usl
It’s cupboard love. We suit them, make their
money go a lung way, and generally render the
path of life an easy one. There’s no sentiment
about it. It’s real biz, and no mistake. In that
way we are beloved throughout Australia, the
measure of affection each one bestows upon us
being gauged by the amount of benefit received.
The more you buy at our store the greater your
liking for us will become, because the more you
invest with us the better dividends you receive.
If living IN THE COUNTRY, send for our
Catalogue and Patterns of anything you require;
if in town, call every day.

HOW BABIES SUFFE
From Torturing
When their tender Skins are literally On Fire with Itching and
Burning Eczemas and other Itching, Scaly, and Blotchy Skin and
Scalp Diseases, none but mothers realize.
To know that a single application of the Cuticura Reme-
dies will, in the great majority of cases, afford instant and complete
relief, permit rest and sleep, and point
to a permanent and economical (because
so speedy) cure, and not to use them
without a moment’s delay, is to be guilty
of positive inhumanity. [No greater leg-
acy can be bestowed upon a child than
a skin without blemish and a body nour~
ished with pure blood.
CUTICURi
Remedies are the greatest skin
cures, blood purifiers, and humor reme-
'V,
'X
dies, are absolutely pure, and may be used from pimples to scrofula,
from infancy to age, with the most gratifying and unfailing success.
Treatment. CuticurA, the great skin cure, and Cuticura Soap, an exquisite
skin purifier and beautifier, externally, instantly allay the most intense itching, burn-
ing and inflammation, soothe and heal raw and irritated surfaces, dear the skin and
scalp of crusts and scales, and restore the hair, while Cuticura Resolvent, the new
blood and skin purifier and greatest of humor remedies, cleanses the blood of all

Cobb and Co.
[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
By North and South, and East and West,
By dawn and dark and day,
By swamp and plain and mountain crest
They take the foremost way ;
And where the slanting sun-rays dip
And underneath the stars
Is heard the thunder of the whip
And creaking of the bars ;
And out beyond the reach of rail
As far as wheel-tracks go
The drovers round their camp-fire hail
The lights of Cobb and Go.
The settlers wait at death o’ day
To hear their rolling wheels,
Where faintly through the twilight grey
The far whip challenge steals ;
They take the messages of love
And bring them safely through—
The faithful sun that rides above
Is not more loyal-true—
They bear the lines of shame and sin,
The words of weal and woe;
And life itself is trusted in
The hands of Cobb and Co.
Their holdings stretch afar and wide
O’er range and blue-grass rood—
They know them on the Queensland side,
And all their cheques are good ;
Their drovers through the Border ply
South-east from Mulga town,
And whether tracks be green or dry
Their mobs are moving down—
While feeding with a half-mile spread
The lazy wethers go,
The notice reads : “ A thousand head
Of fats from Cobb and Co.”
The bullock-driver scarcely feels
His way on new-cut track
Ere Cobb and Co., with lighter wheels,
Have run the marks out-back ;
And while the seasons come and go
And through the changing years
All flags are dipped to Cobb and Co.,
The Western pioneers;
What reck if all the creeks are dry
And hot winds blight and blow,
We’ll meet and fill our glasses high—
“ Good luck to Cobb and Co.!’’

A Sydney newspaper office has this notifi-
cation where all concerned may see it : “No Allu-
sion to Frankenstein for the next six months.”
A Melb. Herald correspondent;—
There are only two papers in the colonies worth read-
ing. One is the Herald. The other is the Sydney
Bulletin.
But, as Whistler said about Velasquez, why drag
in the Hkrald?
Dear Bulletin, —lie “Sappho Smith’s’
ballet-girl who danced her best when drunk, such
cases are not very uncommon. I once knew a
pressman who never wrote so well as when you set
him going with a skinful. But you had to keep
on stoking him. Omit the rhythmically-adminis-
tered nobbier and over he’d go in a second and a
heap. After which all the grog in the universe
wouldn’t get a line out of him.—A.M.
Browning’s “Sludge the Medium” was
taken from Home. This impostor entirely deluded
Mrs. Browning, and persuaded her he would
make her dead baby appear. The lights were
duly lowered, and the baby appeared over theedge
of the table. The infuriated Browning made a
grab, and, as he said, “I seized the obscene
naked foot of the ruffian,” who was forthwith
kicked out, and his boot and sock followed him.
Victoria’s powerful war-vessel, Nelson, is
now old enough to be draughty and cool, and it
has been decided that the Defence department’s
proposal to stop her cracks with a coat of paint
would spoil the ship as a butter-cooler. The
Nelson is now in charge of a watchman in a quiet
corner of Hobson’s Bay, where the water is
thickened by Melb. drainage and affords safe
flotation, and where the fish are too comatose with
sewage-gas to knock an old ship about. By the
way, there is supposed to be a navy somewhere
about Sydney Harbor. Premier Reid is hereby
recommended to appoint a commission to enquire:
(1) Whether there is such a navy.
(2) Whether any portion of it could be utilised for the
culture of oysters and stout.

According to N.S.W. grog-secretary Bevill
there appears to be nothing to stop any licensed
N.S.W. spirit-merchant from selling single glasses
of spirits or wine or beer. The Act says he is to
sell not less than 2gals. of liquor atone and the
same time, but if he does otherwise he cannot be
punished, since there is no fine stated, and no
mode of procedure indicated. Two-direotly con-
flicting decisions have been given by two different
Supreme Court Judges on this point. And even
if the N.S.W. cold-water brigade succeeded in
closing up the pubs., they would be powerless to
deal with the wholesale licenses without compen-
sation, remarks Sydney Licensing Guardian, as
the Act does not provide for the cancellation of a
spirit-merchant’s license when once granted, and
it especially states that such a license shall be
renewed upon application and payment of the fee
at the Treasury.

SATURDAY, MARCH 23, 1895.
Chiefly Concerning Second Chambers.
In an essay on “ Second Chambers,” Grant
Allen utters a captivating fallacy. Progress
is uphill work, he says. Therefore we are
careful to provide a drag beforehand—for an
uphill journey. That is the whole philo-
sophy of Second Chambers. And the average
reader is so tickled with the metaphor that
he never bothers to ask himself, or Mr.
Grant Allen, whether all legislation is pro-
gress. Which is lucky for the neat little
fallacy, for the answer is inevitable that it
is very doubtful whether even half the mass
of legislation is progressive ; and if Second
Chambers prevent from passing only a tithe
of the harmful legislation that actually does
pass, they more than justify their existence.
The Bulletin recently printed a summary
of Maoriland legislation, showing that of the
Acts passed between 1853 and 1876 it has
already been found necessary to repeal 95
per cent., and of the Acts passed between
1876 and 1894, 53 per cent. Since most laws
have a restrictive tendency, what a hin-
drance to the free play of effort, the natural
development of industry, must so much
mistaken legislation have been ! What a
“ drag on progress ” in the fetters with
which those repealed laws bound the
community before it gathered strength
to shake them off! A good law, once
its goodness is generally understood,
cannot for long be kept off the statute-book ;
buc when a bad law is on the statute-book,
how long is it before it can bo taken off!
We are expiating now, for example, the
folly of the-Parliament which passed stupid
Sunday-observance laws in the reign of
Charles 11. In spite of ridicule, in spite
of reason, Sunday recreation is illegal, and
the man comparatively free for six days in
the week is on the seventh a slave to the
institutions of 300 years ago.
The statute-book of every Australian pro-
vince bristles with similar enactments, which
are every day a cause of loss, or annoyance,
or injustice ; and which yet have a force of
inertia sufficient to resist all attempts at
removal. Are we any wiser than our ances-
tors ? Is it not reasonable to suppose that
our posterity will groan in the bondage of
laws which we are now in our unwisdom
making, just as vainly as we groan under the
bondage of laws made by those whose pos-
terity we are 1 Every generation finds out
that the previous generation mostly
spent its time in doing very foolish
things; and no generation ever dreams
that the things which it commends
itself for doing are often precisely those in
which the next generation will discern most
ground for blame. Cobden and Bright
congratulated themselves on having made
England a Freetrade country and laid the
foundation of her eternal prosperity ; but
one finds to-day that their policy has ruined
English agriculture, destroyed the race of
English yeomen, and made deer-parks and
game-preserves of millions of acres formerly
under tillage, while the population has
crowded into cities become huge war-
rens for breeding starved and stunted
laborers in the service of Mammon, and a
war which stopped for one week the im-
portation of food from foreign countries
would kill hundreds of thousands by famine.
In addition to this, such a change has come
over public thought that, in the view of the
most capable of present-day Freetraders,
a return to a Protective policy is only a
question of time.
• * •
Seeing, then, that the whole course of
legislation is full of blunders which admit
only'of slow and painful atonement ; that
any single step is at least as likely to be a
step backward as a step forward ; and that
the cost of possible retrogression is likely to
outweigh the value of possible progress : is
anything lost by employing a Second Cham-
ber as drag on a journey of which it is
impossible to predicate beforehand whether
it will be downhill or uphill ? A Second
Chamber representative of property only
is a monstrosity to be destroyed as soon
as possible ; but a Second Chamber
elected by the proportional or contingent
votes of the whole community, formed into a
single electorate on an adult-suffrage basis,
would be likely to give a far more valuable
decision on any question than any Austra-
lian Legislative Assembly can give under the
present system. Take an illustration from
New South Wales. The Assembly, last
week, approved in a thin House an Eight
Hours Legal Labor Bill, which punishes
with tine or imprisonment a workman or
employer, belonging to certain trades, who
works or permits to work for more than
eight hours a day, except in certain specified
cases.
• * *
Now, this Bill is spoken of by its sup-
porters in press and Parliament as express-
ing “the will of the people,” since it has
passed through what is called “the popular
House and should it be thrown out by the
Legislative Council (as there is little doubt
will be the case), the circumstance will be
referred to as another misuse of power by
the unrepresentative Second Chamber, in
defiance of the people’s wishes. It is worth
while, therefore, to see whiit in this instance
that glib phrase, “the will of the people,”
really means. The 46 members who sup-
ported the Bill were elected last year by
some 39,000 voters. Therefore, so far as
the evidence goes, only 39,000 voters out of
203,000 are in favor of the Bill, and the
voice of their representatives utters “the
will of the people ! ” Possibly other voters
approve the Bill ; but of that there is no
proof. Their representatives either opposed
it in Parliament or stayed away from the
division because they wished to oppose it,
yet did not care to risk possible loss of popu-
larity. At all events, so far as there is any
warrant to suppose, only 19 per cent, of the
voters on the roll at last election, only 7 per
cent, of adult men and women, wish the Bill
passed, and it is at the instance of such an
insignificant minority that we are to under-
take a most momentous interference with
the personal liberty of every individual in
the community. On this ground alone, the
Legislative Council is justified in declining to
discuss the Bill.
* # #
If the Bill be examined, one’s opinion of
the good sense of the minority falls consider-
ably. If there is any country on earth where
“ the working-man,” as organised in trades-
unions, is well off, that country is Australia.
Times of depression, of course, occur in all
countries ; but, generally speaking, this
statement is correct. The eight-hours rule
is recognised in every trade to which it can
profitably be applied ; and wages are, pro-
portionally, at least as high as anywhere else.
These advantages the associated trades have
gained by effort and combination, assisted by
the sentiment of the community, which has
rationally decided that eight hours is a suffi-
cient day’s work wherever the nature of the
work permits of arbitrary limitation. Every
Ist of May we hold a workmen’s holiday,
when there are processions, and banners,
and banquets, to commemorate the victory.
And now, having secured their right by per-
sonal struggle and the force of public opinion,
it is found that the right has no value unless
the community is compelled to give by law
what it has already given without law !

It is not contended that all interference
with the hours of labour is wrong, or that
non-interference is necessarily to be com-
mended. But The Bulletin’s judgment is
that, in Australia at the present time, an
Eight Hours Legal Labour Bill, such as that
which has passed the N.S. W. Assembly, would
create evils worse than those it attempts to
remedy. To prevent over-time or further to
shorten hours would not solve the unem-
ployed problem, for, even granting that the
unemployed are temporarily absorbed, the
first period of depression will bring them
again to the surface. On the other hand, by
tending to make labor more unprofitable to
the employer, the chances are that the pro-
posed changes would throw still more men
out of employment. The N.S.W. Bill, too,
is class-legislation—chiefly for the classes
which least need it. The agricultural and
station laborer, whose work is quite as
laborious as that of the tradesman, are, with
a host of other laborers, placed outside the
scope of the Bill. And, if shop-assistants
are to work no more than eight hours, why
should not the law in the same manner pro-
tect clerical-assistants ? Finally, the idea
that the position of the workman is im-
proved by decreasing production, so that
it will take two men to do the work of
one, is thoroughly unsound. The position
of the laborer in any community depends
chiefly upon the aggregate wealth pro-
duced by the community. The more there
is to divide, the greater is his average share;
the less there is produced, the less he gets.
• # *
The restrictions of the Bill would so cer-
tainly prove unbearable by the workers
themselves—although a team of 32 bullocks
could be driven through every one of
its badly-drawn clauses —that it is almost
a phy its doom is sealed beforehand.
A little wholesome experience of the
unexpected developments which follow
such indiscreet legislation would do good
to those individuals who believe that
every flaw in human nature, or in social
justice, can be mended by passing a big Bill
or a little Bill to set things right. Yet one
sees in the circumstances some ground for
the belief that a Second Chamber has its
uses. When a majority of members of the
First Chamber shirk their duty of discussion
and voting from fear of angering an extreme
section of constituents, when the Ministry
similarly allows the control of public busi-
ness to be taken out of its hands in order to
placate an extreme section of supporters, it
is something to be able to rely upon a
Second Chamber acting uprightly, even from
doubtful motives. And if a Property
Chamber can occasionally do the community
such a service, what might not a People’s
Chamber do, elected periodically upon the
broadest and safest possible basis ?
PLAIN ENGLISH.
Grief and Grovel.
Everybody was truly sorry to hear of the death
of Governor Duff— a stranger in a strange land
—dying, indeed, among family and friends, but
far from home and kinsmen, and from all the
associations that soften the bitterness of the
parting pang. The suddenness with which his
illness developed, his position as titular head of
the New South Wales Government, the always
striking exhibition of the impotence of wealth
and power in the face of Death, all contributed
to impress the popular imagination and soften
asperities of criticism upon the ended life. It was
generally recognised that Gov. Duff deserved
well of the community, though his relations
with it were almost entirely unfortunate.
Cultured, able, and upright, he had yet no
social adaptability ; and his age and character,
if they did not prevent him from comprehend-
ing the radical difference between Australian
and English thought and conditions, at all
events hindered him from moulding himself to
suit his altered circumstances. Consequently,
he was never a “popular” Governor: he was
always a man aloof from, out of touch with the
people ; and the consciousness that this was
so made his attempts at conciliation even more
supremely unsuccessful than they would other-
wise have been. He was never so happy as
when permitted to retreat to his country
residence at Moss Yale, and shut his door for a
brief space upon the weary formalists, the
fulsome sycophants, and the petty, squabbling
politicians, who made his life at other
times a burden. Gov. Duff’s Australian
career opened inauspiciously, for the official
mouthpieces demanded a peer, and sulked in
the newspapers when a newly-dubbed knight,
bebaubled expressly for exportation, was thrown
to them. His 22 months’ tenure of office
bristled with social and political misunder-
standings ; and his sad experience has now
ended in the saddest climax. But it is
one thing to make frank expression of
the general sorrow, and to utter the honest
sympathy with Gov. Duff’s bereaved family
which The Bulletin is convinced is felt by all
its readers; and another thing to affect, as
does the S.M. Herald, to consider the loss in
the light of “a national calamity.” The occa-
sion gave the Herald an opportunity for
grotesque and incongruous grovel which has
not occurred to that respectable journal before,
and which, in view of the near approach of the
Australian Commonwealth, may never occur
again; and the Herald fell to the occasion
ignobly.
Dailey’s Monument.
The casual autumn ass proposes to enstatue
Plain Bill Dalley in immortal bronze, and the
Soudan donkey leads a chorus of hee-haws which
distinctly specify the only standpoint from which
the proposal can be commended. In truth,
this business of modern statue-making grows
continually more ridiculous. When sculntors
crowded to model the beautiful body of
Alcibiades, Nature justified and Art acclaimed
them. Nude, he was perfect; clothed, he was
hardly less perfect, for the poetic garb of his
day did its best to give an added grace to
beauty. But with moderns, who have for-
gotten the culture of the body, and daily defile
“ the temple of the living God ” with in-
numerable abominations of diet, and drink,
and dress, the statuary is only a vulgar parodist
who degrades his art to the level of Ins un-
speakable times. Conceive the horror of
Scopas jer Praxiteles, commissioned to adorn
an Australian landscape with a figure of the
genial little hero of the Soudan ! Dalley’s sex
would be in his favor, for every true artist finds
his pleasure in the equal, delicate outlines of
the unspoiled male, rather than in the gross
curves of his short-legged, disproportionate
complement. But strip him ! —the fat, little
legs ; the ugly, protuberant trunk ; the head,
massive and strong indeed, but with a flabby,
round face swelling over a twinkling Irish nose
—how far all these from the idealised Apollo !
Clothe him ; accentuate his shapelessness with
the stiff coat, the execrable trousers ; and
all the boasted opulence of the Grecian
tongue could never yield imprecations enough
for the artist to fling at his model ! And
then to mar the beauty of a charming garden
with such an outrage, for the mob to pass
languidly, incuriously ; for the few to pass
swiftly, shuddering ! —no doubt the inartistic
sense of Australia would endure even this, as
it has endured already outrages even more
atrocious. But Dalley’s friends, if they are
well-advised, will seek to perpetuate the
memory of the brilliant wit, eloquent advocate,
and ever-generous man by collecting and pub-
lishing his speeches and writings, with a
memoir of his life ; or, better still, by endowing
an educational trust which will live and give
scholars reason to bless his name from genera-
tion to generation ; or, if they must caricature
his ignoble body, by seeking a niche for another
Sydney Post-Office carving. But a statue of
Dalley, or any other politician, in a public
place—Art forbid ! There are already some
funds in the committee’s hands ; let them be
used as the nucleus of a Dalley scholarship
fund, which The Bulletin will help to com
plete.
Direct Taxation.
The Land and Income-tax Bill is practically
through New South Wales Legislative Assembly.
Only the unimproved value of land is taxed,
with exemption to .£475. The provisions in
case of mortgage are a little intricate. The
mortgagee is taxed on that part of the amount
of the mortgage which bears to the total amount
the same proportion that the unimproved value
bears to the total value of the land, if improved.
Thus, in the case of land worth unimproved
£lOOO, improved £6OOO, and mortgaged for
£3OOO, the mortgagee pays on a-sixth of his
mortgage, i.e., £5OO, and the owner on the
remaining £25 of the £lOOO after £475 exemp-
tion has been deducted. Were the mortgage
for £4200, the mortgagee would pay on £7OO
did not the exemption make the maximum
liability £525 in the £lOOO of unimproved
value. If owners, therefore, have been anxious
in the past to get as high an advance as possible,
they will be still more anxious when Mr.
Reid’s Bill passes, for the higher the ad-
vance the more tax paid by the mortgagees.
The income-tax gives exemption up to £3OO,
and property charged under the land-tax is not
liable for income-tax. The National Ass, by-
the-by, is up on its hind-legs again to save
“ the poor farmer” from ruin. It is touching
to see how eager the representatives of
absentees, the gorgers of country freeholds, the
financial sharks and the banking crocodiles, are
to save “ the poor farmer.” Never a thought of
themselves ! Now, as the farmer whose land
(without improvements) is worth £475- is a
moderately rich farmer these times ; as he is
not to be taxed until his land is worth £475;
and as he is only taxed Id. in the £ after that,
so that unimproved land worth £lOOO would
only pay £2 3s. 9d. per annum, it is
pretty clear that Fat Man is merely
endeavouring to save his own precious
skin, and no one else’s whatsoever. Any-
body who takes the trouble to think can
see why the defenders of Property are so
anxious to avoid direct taxation of land and
wealth and to maintain indirect 1 taxation
through the Customs. Property can’t escape
the direct tax ; but every additional Customs
impost gives it a chance to dodge its fair con-
tribution to the finances. Of tea and sugar
and flour and other necessaries of life a poor
man consumes about as much as a rich one.
But the duty the poor man pays is, in propor-
tion to his income, much more than the rich
man pays. Say duty on the necessaries con-
sumed by a single individual is £4 per annum,
the man with £lOO a year is taxed £4 per cent,
of his income, but the man with £lOOO a year
is taxed only Bs. per cent, of his. But an in-
come-tax of Id. in the £l, with exemption to
£3OO, taxes £lOOO a year £2 18s. 4d. per
annum, while £lOO a year comes off scot free.
No self-respecting Fat Man can be ex-
pected to acquiesce quietly in such injustice.
Were Customs duties on the necessaries of life
entirely superseded by the equivalent in direct
taxation, the policy of Protection would not in
the least be interfered with. Customs duties
and Protection are not at all synonymous. A
much simpler way of protecting any local
industry is to prohibit the importation of any
competitive products whatever, or of such pro-
portion of requirements as local industry is
incompetent to produce. This is true and
logical Protection. Customs duties are kept in
force partly because they are easily collected,
partly because they let Fat Man oft’ a great
part of the load which he ought to bear, and
his parliamentary representatives accordingly
defend them with might and main, and partly
because there is a common objection to direct
taxation because it is “ inquisitorial,” and
because a lump sum paid away in cash appeals
to the imagination more than the duty pennies
paid away on every article bought. But once
the mass of the people see how much better
is direct taxation, how much easier to the
poor man, Customs duties will be practically
abolished.


Pap for Sharks.
The Vic. Supreme Court has, for weeks past,
been brought up on the bottle, so to speak. A
Judge and jury of six have sat sucking milk
diet from a select family libel-case, known as
Lange v. Bage. Mrs. Lange, the widow of a
wealthy and respected Melb. merchant, was
accused of mental crankiness by her son-in-
law, Dr. Bage, and she is suing him to
recover <£looo damages for libel and slander.
The modesty of her claim bears out the good
lady’s statement that she didn’t want to take
proceedings on her own account, but is merely
doing it for the sake of her grandchildren, who
wouldn’t like to be associated with an eccentric
grandmother. Therefore, the private history of
Mrs. Lange’s relations with Dr. Bage and half-
a dozen other members of the family is let loose
upon the world in order that sundry children may
not entertain a thought which would probably
never have occurred to them in after days had
the history aforesaid remained in its proper
place. The question as to Mrs. Lange’s com-
monplace sanity will cling to the tribal name
'or a quarter of a century. Nobody who reads
, casual column of this long-drawn-out narra-
tive can blot the remembrance of its awful
puerility from his brain. Each witness in turn
has been examined and cross-examined re such
matters as the alleged bristling of plaintiff’s
h iir when Mr. Sachse, M.L.A. —another son-
in-law—unexpectedly flung his hat into her
sitting-room. On the one hand there is a con-
flict of family evidence concerning the amount
of bristle in Mrs. Lange’s locks ; on the other
band the jury are asked to consider whether
the hair, being “ rolled,” was able to bristle even
if it felt so disposed. And when the contending
counsel have discussed the possibilities of Mrs.
Lange’s scalp from their respective points of
view, and the Judge has summed up for and
against bristles, the jury will remain densely
ignorant as to the effect which any sudden
apparition of an M.L.C.’s flying cadey might be
expected ti have upon some people’s hair. The
rast of the evidence contains nothing of more
importance than the “ bristles ” incident. It is
merely a detailed account of a family unplea-
santness, with no apparent malice in it. The
case of Lange v. Bage could, and ought, to have
been settled at a family picnic by an all-round
admission that everybody in this world is mad
more or less. Instead of which the lawyers are
enjoying a picnic at the family’s expense.
lie’s but one more. The shivering soul turns
sick
To think of him, a ghastly, shapeless thing
Amongst the damned, who, neither dead nor
quick,
Are cursed with all that life and death can
bring,
As though the sense of life were bid to stay,
And for long years, with dim, dull, dreadful
eyes
To watch the stealthy process of decay,
Whilst, bit by bit, the shrouding body dies.
Where next will fall the Plague’s infernal hand?
Will’t smear with poisonous taint the fair,
sweet face
Of some dear daughter of the rich, or brand
A master of the people in his grace ?
We feel the monstrous presence, and we shrink
With eyes all wide with fear, and teeth hard-
set,
And strive to put it from us —not to think,
But only to be restful and forget.
’Tis well to lead the thoughts of men awhile
To that dread hospice of the leprous clan,
And make them know the guests so grim, so
vile—
The festering heap there that was once a
man,
The limbless wretch whose filmed eyes discern
No sky, no sun, whose prayer is to the sod :
A sight is this to make the holiest turn
With cries of protest to the passive God.
Anr| yet we knew whence came this, how
’twould breed,
And let it come to slake the greedy thirst
Of those who talk of Cheapness as a creed—
Nor bared the arm and dared to battle first.
And still the stream pours in to taint the sun,
To sow infection in the scented shade,
And of those gangrened victims is each one
An offering to the ghoulish god of Trade.
Melb. Edward Dyson.
The Bulletin is not surprised at the develop-
ment of leprosy in the Brisbane schoolboy
whom Minister Tozeh has escorted with such
touching care to the lazarette. On the contrary,
it has expected and prophesied for a long time
that the province which lias labored so hard to
acclimatise yellow races will not miss a single
one of the consolations that close association
with yellow races is calculated to confer. The
only pity is that the son of some mongrel-wel-
coming Crown Minister was not chosen by an
unwise Providence as a subject of leprous
infection. Then there would be a hope of a
sudden change in Kanaka]a vjapchowcoolieland
policy. As long as the leprosy selects as vic-
tims merely the children of insignificant white
working-men, Boodlewraith and the Banks will
probably be permitted to disseminate Asia! .c
tilth and disease unchecked. The commund v
of Townsville, for example, where hundreds of
people have suffered, and scores have died,
during the last few months from what is known
as dengue fever, prefer to see in the plague
rather the hand of God than the direct effect of
importing hordes of Javanese for the sugar
plantations. The Bulletin congratulates the
northern province on its docility. With the
Boodlewraith banks steadily soaking up its
assets, the Boodlewraith land-grabber assimila-
ting its territory, and the Boodlewraith plagues
decimating its inhabitants, it still licks the
hand that throttles it, and tries to shout once
more before it chokes, “ God bless Boodle-
wraith ! ”
Pastor Frackelton, of the Presbyterian
way of thinking, reports that the failure of
Australian village settlements, whenever
they have failed, is mainly owing to
“ the want of religious unity among the
settlers.” Plain, ordinary people imagined
that the failure was owing to the fact that the
settlers knew little or nothing about agricul-
ture, or had no capital, or were badly supplied
with tools, or were dumped down on bad land
which no one would buy, or had no convenient
market, or were tied to the tail of an impractic-
able theory. But it seems that it was all owing
to the want of religious unity. If the settlers had
possessed religious unity they could have grown
corn whether they knew how to do it or not,
just as the man who is solid on religion can
make a watch or a chest of drawers even
though he doesn’t know how to make them,
while the irreligious man can’t make them even
if he does know how to make them. These
facts are so well-known that there isn’t the
slightest necessity for proving them; they
simply demonstrate themselves. The church s
capacity for explaining things is marvellous ; it
has only one reason—the want of religious
unity—and that accounts for bankruptcy,
drunkenness, caterpillars, droughts every-
thing.
Why is a determined effort not made by Vic.
democrats to capture the municipalities? Once
done, the minimum-wage question would be far
on its way to solution ; monopolies such as gas-
works and tram-lines would be acquired and
worked for the benefit of the inhabitants;
nefarious occupations benefiting the present
crowd would be stopped by the help of
stringent health laws ; early closing, &c., if
desirable, could be insisted on ; contracts for a
man, horse, and dray, at 4s. lid. per day,
would be unheard of; and the wretched and un-
democratic J.P. system would disappear when
democrats were thought likely to get hold of
the ropes. The work is not impossible. Organi-
sation alone is necessary, for the bulk of the
ratepayers, if their interest is roused in the
matter, are sound enough. There are vague
clauses, too, in the Local Government Act,
under which brainy democrats could do social
work of a nature that would probably bring
about a silent revolution on, say, the unem-
ployed difficulty. At present, the municipal
council system is a grave danger to the success
of progressive work. Its position is practically
that of a Third Chamber working in the
interests of those whom the Second Chamber
represents, and by whom the First Chamber is
wheedled and, usually, euchred. Capture is
not impossible ; Reform Bills have been won on
a far more restricted franchise.
John Wordsworth, Bishop of Salisbury (Eng.),
now visiting Australia, appears to be an in-
effectual ecclesiastic with no very definite ideas
about anything—except tire paramount neces-
sity of teaching in State schools the religion
which supplies J. W. with £5OOO a year and
pickings. “He that is not with me in the
matter of education is against me,” misquotes
the bishop. What ancient Jewish ideas might
be about modern Australian education wouldn’t
much matter; but, seeing the ancient Jews
didn’t discover Australia, and didn’t know
there was such a place, and had no ideas what-
ever about systems of education in operation
2000 years after they genuflexed about their
’Change-cam-temple, the point of the misquota-
tion isn’t clear. The Bulletin takes this
opportunity, however, to ask Bishop Words-
worth what he thinks of that text about the
rich man and the camel, also of the parable of
Dives and Lazarus, together with the injunc-
tions to poverty which Jesus gave His disciples.
What does Bishop Wordsworth consider his
Master’s greeting would be to a rather stout
and not-too-well-favored disciple who explained
that he really couldn’t serve Him decently
under £lOO a week or so ? Probably something
choice and warm in the original Syriac.
The Age, which, though professing Liberal
views in Victoria, is addicted to misrepresent-
ing and belittling Liberal movements in England
and elsewhere, screams ridiculously about the
progressive work done by the London County
Council: “There has been extravagance and
more than a suspicion of corruption in the Pro-
gressive administration,” it says. Now, the
bitterest enemies of the London Progressive
party have never said it has been in the faintest
degree corrupt, and its fair critics have never
alleged that it has been extravagant. Its worst
faults have been an unfortunate leniency
towards priggish prudery and the cant of the
Nonconformist conscience. The Progressives
have at least made London a little more habit-
able for the decent workman, and a little less
of a field for the operations of the sweating con-
tractor, the slum jobber and the jerry builder.
The Age is probably ignorant of these
things ; but as its ignorance suppresses the
fact that the Council has, under the Pro-
gressives, abolished the contract system and
established a minimum rate of wages for its
employes, the democratic readers of the Age
have a right to feel dubious about the sincerity
of the organ.
The advocacy of State control of the drink-
traffic grows apace in Australia. Sydney
Presbytery, the largest body of clergy in con-
nection with N.S.W. Presbyterian Church,
some time ago appointed a committee to con-
sider the question. This committee, which
comprised some of the most hard-headed and
advanced thinkers belonging to what is
probably the most intelligent and best-
educated body of Australian clergy, reported in
favor of the Gothenberg system, whereat some
of the dreary “pillars” stood petrified and
aghast. The report was last week submitted
to the annual assembly of ministers and elders.
Much discussion followed, and about the only
tangible objection was that of the gimlet brigade,
who objected to being made compulsory share-
holders in the debasing drink-traffic. Which
is no real objection, as they are now, along
with every other member of the community,
shareholders to the extent of the benefit derived
from the duties on alcohol. This is the sort of
person who, while horror-stricken at the idea of
Statemanagement of public-houses, will cordially
hob-nob with the fat church-subscriber who
draws his weekly rent from the pub. where vile
compounds of white spirit are traded off as
honest grog. The Bulletin derives satisfaction
from the fact that the motion for the adoption
of the report-was only lost by a majority of 10
in a House of close on 100; and ventures to pre-
dict that the majority will be still narrower
when next the subject is discussed.
“ It is questionable whether a desirable man
will ever be kept from the post of Governor by
a reduction of his salary.” Thus the S.M.
Herald when Victorian retrenchers were
hacking at the salary of Gov. Hopetoun s suc-
cessor, and it is to be hoped that it will con-,
tiuue to so express itself when New South
Wales retrenchers avail themselves of the first
chance to cut down the salary of Gov. Dupe’s
successor. Press unanimity is needed on this
matter, as fully one-third of the present Legis-
lative Assembly, and more than six-sevenths of
the Council, may be counted on to resist a reduc-
tion of salary on the sole old ground that
if New South Wales wants a good man at
Government House, the established price must
be paid for the luxury. Whatever in the future
it may be necessary to pay a Governor elected
by the people, and invested by them with high
powers of administration and control, it should
be insisted that only a tithe of that sum is
honestly earned by the ornamental personages
who now play at Governor. When New
South Wales first claimed the right of managing
her own affairs, the British Govt, endeavored
to impose on her a civil list of .£Bl,OOO, and,
at a later stage, one of £73,000, the idea being
to discipline the small community into the
Imperial habit of raiding the taxpayer for the
special benefit of those “in high station. The
endeavor, though abortive in one way, appears
to have succeeded in another, for from that day
till now Australasia has been paying more per
annum for ornamental figureheads than popu-
lations 12 times as large have paid for highly-
gifted, hard-working Presidents, with national
cares and world-wide responsibilities on their
shoulders.
Room for the Leper.
A considerable sensation has been caused in Brisbane
(,y the discovery that a bright, intelligent lad, aged 11
v ars, attending the Normal school, is suffering from
leprosy. . . . No theory can yet be formed as to how
he contracted the disease. Both parents are Europeans.
. After due consideration the parents decided, in
the interests of the boy’s sisters and brother, that it
would be better for the Government to take charge of
him. It was, therefore, arranged that he be removed to
the lazarette. —Daily paper.
Gone to the horrors of a living death,
To rot, and be consumed with loathed disease,
Yet have all agonies of sense and breath —
To feel the worm, to crumble by degrees,
Abhorred of kin, and prisoned in a den
Apart from love and hope, to herd with none
iJut hideous shapes, vile, fragmentary men,
Persistent nightmares creeping in the sun !
Max Hirsch’s Superstition.
Editor Bulletin, —Sir, —Under the above
caption you have published an alleged review
of “The Fiscal Superstition,” which, in the
choicest Balletinese, accuses me of having in-
vented the statistical material contained therein.
Fortunately for me, you have descended to
details and thereby enable me to disprove your
allegation, provided you have the fairness to
publish this letter.
* • *
To begin with, I am constrained to admit
that my book does contain two errors, one of
which has been correctly spotted by you —viz.,
instead of one paper-mill and one candle-works,
there are two of the former and three of the
latter in Victoria. Everyone of the many
other inaccuracies, or inventions, with which
you charge me has, however, no existence.
* » •
You allege that, instead of “one ammunition
and cartridge factory,” and “ one dynamite
factory,” as~ stated by me, Hay ter’s Victorian
“ Year Book,” 1893, pp. 275-279, registers six
each of these kind of works. In spite of the
assumed accuracy in quoting the pages, Hay ter
does no such thing, as the following verbatim
copy of the entry (page 275), on which you
base your case, will prove :
“ Blasting-powder, cartridge, dynamite, etc., manufac-
tories, 6.”
Of these six factories, only one makes car-
tridges, and only one other manufactures
dynamite. The others are engaged in the
manufacture of other blasting materials.
* * *
Similarly, you quote Hayter as reporting the
existence of 33 candle-works, whereas the pas-
sage on which you rely, page 278, reads:
“Soap, candle-works, 33.” Of these 33 works
only three make candles, the others confining
themselves to soap. This sort of misquotation
may be smart, but it cannot claim to be honest.
* * *
You accuse me of falsely averring that Pro-
tection has killed the fellmongering and meat-
preserving industry, but you conceal that this
statement is made by me on the authority of
the Protectionist Age, as quoted on page 60 of
my book.
* * *
You further state : “ On page 56 he says that
the protective period in Victoria was from ’73
to ’93, and on page 58, when it is convenient to
fix things differently to support a new batch of
statements, he puts down the beginning of
‘ effective ’ Protection at the year 1880.” This
is a misrepresentation, for the statement on
page 56 is a quotation from Sir Graham Berry ;
is his fixing of the protective period and not
mine ; is specially pointed out as a quotation
from this Protectionist authority, and is quoted
by me solely for the refutation of deductions
made by him.
# * *
You state: “He seemingly reckons in his
table only the number of persons employed in
factories as the term is defined by law, while
professing to reckon all persons employed in
factories using the word in the widest and
largest sense.” This is another misrepresenta-
tion. I nowhere “profess” to reckon any
other persons as employed in factories, than
those “employed in factories as the term is
defined by law,” and as supplied in Hayter’s
Year-Book, and for the purpose of giving
color to this misrepresentation you misquote
the provisions of the law as stated in Mr.
Hayter’s letter to me, quoted on page 49 of my
book.
* # •
You also allege that “ for 1888 he seems to
have tacked nearly 6000 non-existing operatives
on to Hayter’s figures,” whereas the number
stated by me for that year, viz., 54,488, is
exactly in accordance with that reported by
Hay ter for 1888-9, page 283, Year-Book,
1888-9. Altogether you have got into a muddle
over the number of operatives employed,
apparently because you did not know that the
Victorian returns relating thereto are made up
to March Ist of each year, and, therefore, refer
principally to the industrial condition of the
previous year.
* * «
You further state : “The export figures for
New South Wales have been taken with toler-
able accuracy from an ancient Customs return
—a more recent one, by Coghlan, which reduces
some of them considerably, has been carefully
avoided.” This is not the case, the figures
being copied, with absolute accuracy, from page
130 of Coglilan’s “ Wealth and Progress of New
South Wales,” 1893, to which edition Mr.
Coghlan himself referred me in reply to an
enquiry for the latest information.
# # *
Still harping on exports of home produce,
you say: “The Victorian figures, when com-
pared with Hayter’s figures, look as if Mr.
Hirsch had deducted .£1,500,000 to .£3,000,000
each year.” I expressly slate, page 48, “Notes
to table A,” that I have made such deductions,
for the reason that Hayter avowedly includes a
portion of the wool and gold produced in other
colonies, and sent through Victoria for export,
in the amount of our export of home produce.
(See re wool-note, page 68, Year-Book, 1893.)
These deductions have been made separately,
by a friend, an able statistician, and myself,
and, on comparison, the result was found to be
the same ; therefore, correct. Your statement
that “it looks ”as if I had done a thing, the
doing of which I have expressly notified to my
readers, is manifestly an attempt to discredit
me at all hazards.
# # *
It is not correct to say, as you do, that
Coghlan (page 248 of “ Seven Colonies ”) states
that “ Victoria, with a smaller population, finds
work for 7000 more males and 18,000 more
females ” than New South Wales. The table
to which you refer merely enumerates, in
Coghlan’s own words, “ the distribution of the
population into characteristic divisions,” and
has nothing whatever to do with actual employ-
ment. For all that this table teaches or pro-
fesses to teach, one half or even all the men
and women enumerated in it might have been
engaged in inspecting the streets.
• * #
The allegation, “he understates the culti-
vated area of New South VI ales, in 1880, by
4000 acres and overstates it in 1890 by 250,000
acres,” is false, according to Hayter. I have
copied the figures, and copied them correctly,
from “ the summary of Australasian statistics ”
attached to the Year-Book for 1893.
# • *
It is true that I have not relied on Hayter
for Victorian wages in 1893, for the simple and
sufficient reason that on this particular subject
the information supplied by him is absolutely
unreliable. This is proved by the fact that,
according to the Year-Book, the wages paid in
the clothing and similar trades in 1892 were the
same or higher than those paid in 1889, which
“every schoolboy” in Victoria knows to be
wrong. The New South Wales statistics, on
the other hand, being based on the inspection
of thousands of wage-books, are reliable.
* * * ,
So much in reply to your accusation that
“ Hirsch apparently makes his own statistics.”
The fact is, as I have here shown, that on this
occasion you have manufactured your own, and
then have attributed them to the Government
statisticians and to myself. Your other critic-
isms are either cavils at deductions on which
a legitimate difference of opinion is possible, or
mere general insinuations of want of veracity
on which I decline to touch. — Yours, Max
Hirsch. Melb., March 11, 1895.
In reply to which Thk Bulletin wishes to make a very
few remarks. (1) This paper is glad to see that Mr. Hirsch
admits his papermill and candle work figures to be incor-
rect, and the only difference of opinion now seems to be
as to the degree of incorrectness. (2) Mr. Hirsch asserts,
quite correctly, that his first statement as to the date
when Protection commenced was a quotation from Graham
Berry. But underneath he says, “ The facts as stated are
true,” therefore Berry’s assertion is also his assertion, and
when he makes quite a different assertion on the next
page this paper has every right to point out the dis-
crepancy. (3) Mr. Hirsch doesn’t point out where or how
The Bulletin misquoted Hayter’s letter on page 49. In
one respect, however, he is right; he doesn’t “profess"
to muddle up the figures ; he simply does it. The Bul-
letin’s figures are supported by Coghlan in his “Seven
Colonies” (page 265).' (4) The Bulletin simply states
that the number of Victorian employes set down by
Hirsch for 1891 are those reported by Hayter for 1892 and
so on. And Mr, H. himself acknowledges that the figures
he gives for each year are those which Hayter gives for
March of the succeeding j ear, so there doesn’t seem much
here to be said. (5) Mr. Hirsch may be right in making
deductions from Victorian “exports of domestic pro-
duce ” to allow for exports which are not domestic
produce, though how he gets his deductions, or on what
authority, isn’t stated. It is not sufficient to say that the
calculations were carefully made “ by a friend ; ” the
question is: On what data did the calculations begin, and
who was the “friend?” But when Mr. Hirsch made
these deductions for Victoria, why didn’t be make
similar deductions for New South Wales? He takes
the gross exports of one province and compares
them with the net exports of the other, said
net exports being arrived at by a process which
he doesn’t explain. Then he whoops. (6) Mr. Hirsch
says that Tub Bulletin’s charge that he over-stated the
cultivated area of N.S. Wales “ is false according to
Hayter.” It is absolutely true according to Hayter. A
foot-note to that gentleman’s tables states that in one
particular year fallow land was reckoned in as “culti-
vated ” in the N.S.W. returns, and Mr. Hirsch picks out
that special year for purposes of comparison. He takes
the figures correctly enough, but ignores the foot-note.
The real figures can be found in Coghlan’s Statistical
Register, but where Hayter and Coghlan disagree Mr.
Hirsch doesn’t accept each one as the best authority in
his own province ; he simply takes the one who supplies
the best case for himself. (7) As to Mr. Hhsch’s explana-
tion re the wages question, it simply amounts to
this: Hayter’s figures don’t suit his case and he
reports that Hayter is incorrect. Coghlan’s figures
do suit his case, and he reports that Coghlan is
beautifully accurate. If he was going to rely on
“ careful personal inquiry ” in one case, w hy didn’t he do
likewdse in the other? (8) The Bulletin’s other state-
ments are not “ mere general insinuations,” &c. The
Bulletin points out that Mr. Hirsch’s deductions from
his own figures as to the prices of cement and other
articles are incorrect; that his freight statistics are built
on a glaring inaccuracy ; that he insists on representing
New' South Wales, for his own purposes, as a Freetrade
province, which it isn’t; and that his assertions re the
comparative fertility of the two provinces are not borne
out by the agricultural statistics.

March 19, 1895.
My Dear Moorabinda—
People who believe in omens will find something
to feed their faith on in the death (from blood-
poisoning caused by liver-abscesses) of the late
Sir Robert Duff, the first N.S. W. Governor to die
in harness. The omen was the falsely-reported
death of Tasmania’s ex-Governor, Sir Robert
Hamilton. Gov. Duff first fell ill at Government
House, Hobart, and people who believe in un-
canny connections will probably consider the
foundationless report of Sir Robert Hamilton’s
death as the courier in advance.
Governor Duff seems to have been most popular
with his intimates, but you can hardly expect a
man coming to a strange country at the age of
nearly three-score to adapt himself to his new sur-
roundings as thoroughly as a young man might
do. Somehow I always thought that the Governor,
whom New South Wales now mourns, had sorrow
and bad luck written on his face, and Lady Duff
also seemed to be inwardly depressed and to feel
thoroughly out of her groove. Perhaps the only
bib of brightness that illumined the vice-regal
existence in Australia was when the late Gover-
nor’s eldest son won a horse-race or two at Rand-
wick and elsewhere. In these moments a wave of
sunshine would pass over the melancholy-looking
vice-regal group, and a flickering gleam of gladness
would set in for some time afterwards. Every-
body felt after the first day or two of the Gover-
nor’s alarming illness that the case was really
more serious than was represented, and those who
had felt the gloom which environed His Excel-
lency’s personality had a foreboding that he was
not of the hopeful material from which good rally-
ing patients are made.
The funeral of the late Governor took place last
Sunday, and the route from Government House to
Waverley Cemetery (where the body was interred)
was thronged with sightseers, some of whom were
so out of touch with the occasion that they wore
St. Patrick’s-day green ribbons in their hats. But,
though the population was sincere in its regret at
the Governor’s death and full of sympathy for
Lady Duff and her grief-stricken family, a State
funeral is a garish procession at best, and does little
more than afford a chance for the numerous self-
advertising class to see their names in the papers,
as “noticed amongst those present,” or to send
funeral flowers with clearly-written cards attached
with the same object. There were a great many
flowers. Following the hearse (which was drawn
by four horses and draped all over with blue cloth,
but with no funeral plumes on either hearse or
horses) came a gun-carriage completely smothered
with advertisements —I mean wreaths—some of
which hung from the Artillery horses’ traces, each
driver also having a wreath round his arm. As
the flowers were not all arbitrarily white (one
wreath was tied with red ribbons), the floral
waggon was a very pretty sight. Lady Duff
attended at the grave, accompanied by her
four daughters, while Lady Darley and Mrs.
Edward Hutton were also on the stiflingly hob
dais, draped in black cloth, which was erected in
the cemetery for the accommodation of the vice-
regal mourners.
The funeral was not a very melancholy spectacle.
Richly-dressed military and naval men, horse and
foot, strings of carriages and vehicles, made quite
a pageant, the surface brightness of which was
enhanced by the absence of crape on the whips.
The most repellent feature of the death and
funeral of His Excellency is the cold-blooded
aggressiveness with which all conditions of people
have seized the occasion as an opportunity for
reclame. Even in the mock-eloquent newspaper
accounts of the Governor’s dying moments the
vulgar trade-advertisement boldly obtruded itself.
This is certainly an age of advertisement. For
instance, when, the other day, a person of con-
siderable importance died in the South, the local
Mr. Mould, who was to manage the obsequies,
constructed the coffin in full view of the shop-
window, round which was gathered the usual
street crowd passing criticisms on the progress of
the work. In some countries, by the way, the law
expressly forbids undertakers from displaying
their hideous wares.
The swearing-in of Acting-Governor Darley at
Sydney Treasury last Saturday morning was a
short, formal ceremony at which the comparative
absenoe of women in the crowd was fully compen-
sated for by the splendour of the principals. I
always find official full-fig amusing, and really,
when men laugh at the spectacle of a woman in
knickers and a hard hat, they should try to re-
member how some of their number look dressed in
things like Japanese tea-gowns, and with ambro-
sial false hair on, too. One Judge, especially, in
scarlet (like Chinese mourning) has a bad figure
for a skirt; faced with the same convexity of out-
line below the belt, a woman would let out a tuck
or something.
His Honor Judge Simpson, all in scarlet, with
what looked like one of the new golf napes, had
an Empire sash accentuating the established fact
that he has the smallest waist on the Bench. One
wooden-image sort of potentate wore black silk
richly trimmed with gold that would “cut-up”
afterwards into lovely window-curtains, and Chief
Justice Darley (Norman makes up just like him
in “The Fatal Card”), in a dark-blue suit with
gold edges, looked the part of Acting-Governor to
the life. By the way, why, I wonder, does a
Lieutenant-Governor, when he is being sworn,
want more trimming on his clothes than a real
Governor does under the same circumstances ? A
cocked hat and a yard of ribbon are, so far as I
remember, all the extra finery,Governors wear on
these sacred occasions. Why, then, has the lesser
light to crowd himself into a tight fancy suit ?
A new horror now shakes its gory locks at Aus-
tralian Governors who have the temerity to be
popular—l mean the neigh boring-State-in vita-
tion-to_-eomplimentary-farewell-banquet business
for which Lord Hopetouu’s departure has created
a precedent. It may be a compliment to expect a
jolted, travel-weary potentate to fall out of the
train after a 573 miles journey, and patronise a
quarterly luncheon with the Mayor and his
“suite” (as Josef Battenberg called the Sydney
aldermen); but I do hope that the new style of
over-the-border adieux will stop at Gov. Hope-
toun, Surely a Governor has quite enough jaw-
jaw to face in getting away alive from his own
particular cannibals, without making oratorical
tours to express his grateful sensations to rows of
boiled shirts without legal right to a scratch-back
speech from their neighbours’potentate !
I thought Lord Hopetoun’s farewell to Sydney
very neatly put. At the luncheon he paid a stag-
gering compliment to the little handful of N.S.W.
devotees who make an annual pilgrimage to
Melb. Cup. “It seemed to him,” he said, “that
the brightest and pleasantest citizens visited Mel-
bourne at what was the brightest and pleasantest
time of the year—Cup time.” What a “dis-
played ” ad. a talkative Governor can give, to be
sure ! But I don’t understand about the brightest
and pleasantest citizens! Does his Ex. particu-
larly remark them after the Cup is run and the
fields have been chased home by the favorite?
And how fickle the crowd is ! Only the other day
Lord Carington was spoken of as the ideal
Governor-General of a federated Australia, but
John Louis Adrian Earl of Hopetoun is the cry
just now.
I can’t help thinking that a large factor in the
secret of Lord Hopetoun’s popularity is that he is
very sick at sea. Unlike Gov. Kintore, of the
blotting - paper - pink complexion, who wasn’t
troubled that way, and consequently didn’t let
the water wall him in, Lord Hopetoun has been
tied to Victoria’s apron-string for the whole
stretch. This absenoe of absenteeism about Gov.
Hopetoun was one of the strongest points in his
favor. Even though it may have been occa-
sioned by a dread of “Oh, my,” a Governor
who can point proudly to the fact that he has
always been on hand at the opening of Parlia-
ment is somewhat of a rare bird. In Lord Bras-
sey, the Melbournians will have quite a different
man to deal with. They will need to be careful,
for his barque will always be handy on the Yarra
and he may sail away for a “rest” at any moment.
Whoever does the catechising of possible Gover-
nors before shipping them out should ask, “Are
you a sea-sick subject?” The peer who turns
moonshine-green at the idea of the ocean blue to
get the job.
By the way, the imminent Lord Brassey is
coming with quite a cavalcade, and Victorian
belledom should certainly get a look-in this time,
matrimonially speaking. There is the Earl of
Shaftesbury (Anthony, Ashley Cooper), aged 26.
Lord “Richard Plantagenet Nevill ” looks more
valuable on paper than he probably is, for the fifth
son of a not very considerable marquis is the sort
of forlorn matrimonial hope that any well-regu-
lated chaperone would glare side-ways at, and
authoresses of even unconvincing society novels
would relegate to stolen interviews behind the
ash-heap.
, Lord Strington (Charles Henry Gordon Lennox)
is a Duke’s grandson and an Earl’s son. He is 24,
but is out of the hunt, being Lord Brassey’s
nephew-in-law, though the circumstances are miti-
gated by the fact that he will be a grass-widower
when he gets here. Mr. and Mrs. Freeman
Thomas (Mrs. F. T. is Lord Brassey’s youngest
At the Tasmanian International Exhibi-
tion one of the prettiest sights is undoubtedly the

requisite, “ Amykos,” which has of late got such
a popular name amongst the people of Aus-
tralia, and is getting a good hold of the Tas-
manians and their guests at the Exhibition.

daughter) tail the procession, which has something
the look of a family party.
Bowler Richardson, of the English team, is, I
hear, engaged to an Armidale girl, the daughter
of a settler in that district, and the marriage will
happen at ’Ome. Perhaps the alliance, in which
Mr. Richardson and his bride will have the
good wishes of all Australia, may have the effect
of inducing him to “deal it out more softly ” to
our boys when next he confronts them in battle
on the greensward. By the way, it takes the
Australian girl to bowl the British heroes over.
Miss Maud FitzStubbs, the composer, was ten-
dered a complimentary farewell dinner at Paris
House the other evening by a number of friends
and admirers prior to her departure for England.
The affair went off most smartly. The guest of
the evening wore a sort of fairy gauze blouse,
white with flecks of pale-pink and blue over a
white silk bodice, the skirt of soft white lace—a
get-up which became her excellently. She sat at
the left of the chairman, Mr. G. Russell-Jones.
who, as an old friend of the family, proposed her
health in a kindly and clever speech. Mr. Jerome
(one of the efficient hosts), Mr. Walsh, and Dr.
West also toasted the guest of the evening. The
whole function was a great success, and when
Miss FitzStubbs rose to reply to the shower of
compliments the enthusiasm was exhilarating.
Miss FitzStubbs goes ’Ome per Ophir to-day
(Saturday), and with everybody’s good wishes for
success.
Yours affectionately, Sappho Smith.

At Sydney Lyceum “The Masqueraders”
continues to set forth the limilations of the Eng-
lish four-act drama. An Auslralian audience can
well bear its drama unlimited and French fashion,
without any foolish fig-leaves ; but so long as we
import our plays from England it is vain to try
and wriggle from the clutch of Mrs. Grundy.
Mrs. Grundy rules Britannia, as Britannia rules
the waves; and the British dramatist knows very
well that whatever he does in the first three acts
he must never omit to appease the respect-
able goddess in the fourth. For three acts
he may flirt with the improprieties and hint
occasionally that conventional commandments
are even sillier than they seem, but in the fourth
act all loose characters must be thoroughly
punished and the superiority of Sunday-school
morality decisively established. Thus nearly all
the recent notable plays end illogically, unsatis-
factorily. The writer puts as much rational sense
and sentiment as he dares into the early scenes of
his story. In the dosing scenes he takes it all
back, and bows his brains to write the smug
hypocrisies of the society fetish. Then Mrs. G.,
whom he has shocked as much as he dares, is
pacified. “Everything ends so nicely.”
* * *
Oscar Wilde, indeed, ventures to give his
wicked women a chance of happiness when the
curtain falls finally. But Pinero is afraid to leave
“ The Second Mrs. Tanqueray ” alive and enjoying
herself. She must be killed off as a sacrifice to
Mrs. Grundy, and an awful example of the fate
which follows failure to march with the regiment.
What a chance is lost for a magnificent speech
from Aubrey Tanqueray, rising in wrath to pull
down the whited sepulchre of mean little sophis-
tries reared by his daughter and his friends, before
flinging his arm round his wife’s waist as a man
should, defying the currish pack, and marching off
to lead a rational life with the woman he has
chosen ! Jones, in “ The Tempter,” his best play
(not yet seen in Australia), cowers similarly at
the close. “The Tempter” enters the lists with
the conventional Deity, and, thanks to human
nature, succeeds brilliantly for three acts. In the
fourth act, human nature remaining precisely the
same, an impossible miracle is worked, a few pious
platitudes uttered, and priestcraft enjoys an
inconsistent triumph in a weak and unconvincing
ending.
• * *
In “ The Masqueraders ” the ending is
even worse. The first three acts might pass,
thanks to Jones’s stage-craft, though they are but
dubious melodrama veneered with a pretty thin
coating of smartness. But the bad taste, the bad
sense, the bad morality of the fourth act are
astounding. Helen Larondie’s adjurations to her
sister not to degrade her sex, Eddie Remon’s
horrible interjection, “That is the voice of God
speaking to you now, Davie,” simply mean that
Jones dare not exhibit to an English audience the
spectacle of a man going off to enjoy a comfort-
able future with another man’s undivorced wife—
no matter how good the character of the pair, how
they have loved, what they have suffered, or what
the villainy of the husband. That would be “ im-
moral.” Throng a court with salacious idlers, let
the newspapers wash a sufficient quantity of dirty
linen ; let a judge formally affirm—what is already
admitted —that the husband is unfit to live with ;
and the union becomes “ moral ”at once. Mean-
while, it is the woman’s duty to discard the man
who loves her, and whom she loves, and go and
live with the brute of a husband whom she hates.
To all whioh The Bulletin says—Bah !
** * *
“The Fatal Card ” has entered upon its
last nights at Sydney Royal, and anyone who
wishes to ruminate on what might happen to
Bland Holt with his clothes off if the tree fell
suddenly, or somebody raised an alarm of “ Fire !”
had better hurry up. On Saturday “ A Million
of Money ” will be revived, and Bland Holt will
dress himself again.*
The Bulletin called at Sydney Tivoli the
other night, in the hope of seeing Larry Dooley
and other eccentricities, but it was met on the
staircase and in the lobbies by a large and excited
crowd who trod on its feet, and breathed
aromatically down its neck, and endeavoured
to clamber over its back in order to see
an invisible performance proceeding half-a-
mile in front; so it took for granted that there
was reasonable cause for so much enthusiasm, and
contented itself with congratulating the manage-
ment, which admitted that Mr. Dooley was dooley-
ing nicely, thank you, and the others were as well
as could be expected. H. Rickards announces that
his transcendent company has accumulated more
lustre in the rounded shape of Horace Wheatley
(not unconnected with a certain mysterious
MTntyre), who will be visible in the latitude of
Sydney about the end of April.
** * *
Of the Dacre season plays, at Melbourne
Bijou, The Bulletin has already remarked that
they cannot be expected to flourish much under
the present system of treatment. On Saturday
night, Sydney Grun ly’s excellent work, “A
Bunch of Violets,” was presented to a half-empty
house in a half-satisfactory style. Yet three
changes in the cast might have made it wholly
satisfactory, even in the absence of Miss Roselle,
who was rather suddenly unable to appear. Clever
Harrie Ireland filled the vacant billet worthily, at
a few hours’ notice. The star’s indisposition
was not nearly so great a misfortune as the fact
that some other ladies were able to appear, and
appeared unequal to their duties.
* * *
The chief personage in “A Bunch of
Violets ” is a dazzling chairman of brittle banks
and energetic stiffener of Nonconformist building
societies. He has but two weaknesses—his senti-
mental attachment to a small, mechanical
daughter, and his blind faith in a lugubrious con-
fidential clerk who records the various swindles in
a note-book, and debits any bad deals to the
Widow’s Mite Provident Society. The boss-
financier is a suggestion of Jabez Balfour, but he
doesn’t slink off with a ton of specie when the
crash comes. The confidential spectre manages to
clean his master out, so there is nothing left for
the poor man save a dose of prussic acid. In his
death agony he clutches his bunch of violets, the
daily token of his daughter’s love, and then the
busted sinner retires to a place of eternal
torment where the Widow’s Mite depositors
can presently drop hunks of Golden Shore on his
throbbing head, and his Judas clerk, having built
a church and found grace, will chant moral pre-
cepts at him from the realms above. Jabez has
enjoyed a fairly rough time before he swallows
the acid. His high-bred wife knows him for what
he is, also their domestic relations suffer from the
unexpected arrival of a former wife. This other
one is a bold, bad serio-comic enigma, addicted to
vivid green and red costumes. There’s no rest
for the bigamist after his old love turns up again,
notwithstanding that she has married a brewer in
the meantime and could well afford to forget the
past.
* * *
Miss Mabel Hardy undertakes the impor-
tant character of the wife. She doesn’t overtake
it at any time; that is to say, Miss Hardy fails to
catch hold of the woman she wishes to represent.
Her acting generally is green and red, like her
lobster-salad scheme of decoration. Miss Harrie
Ireland, William Elton, H. H. Diver, Frank
Cates and Wilfred Shine do credit to the play,
and Arthur Dacre, as the bank-promoter, is an
interesting central figure in every scene. Both he
and Miss Ireland are hampered by the incapacity
of Mias Robertson, the diminutive recruit who
impersonates their daughter, Violet. This young
lady is specially supported by a young male
amateur (her stage-lover) no taller than herself.
Such novices are out of place in such a play, and
their presence is unaccountable. “A Bunch of
Violets ” is quite a different thing to a bunch of
turnips.
* * sif *
“ The New Boy ” seems to be getting on
well at the Princess’s. He is a wholesome joke.
He diffuses a feeling of suet-pudding, French
exercises, and other youthful joys, also the tender-
ness with which he sits down, after a stormy
first-night in No. 1 dormitory, is generally ad-
mired. The comedy might have been strengthened
by a good stand-up mill between Miss Watt-
Tanner’s lion-hearted Archibald and his natural
foe, Master Bullock, terminating in a victory for
the married man. In default of a visible basting
for Bullock, the audience are given to understand
that Nemesis waits upon his crimes in the next
room, but the incident could easily be shown in a
Living Picture, anyway.
** * *
At Melbourne Royal there was a change
of bill on Monday night, but one Irish drama is
so invariably like another that the points of differ-
ence are not worth noticing in detail. Probably
‘‘Conn O’Mara” is a drama devoid of gallows
interest, in which case it will be less wildly absurd
than Charles Erin Verner’s previous entertain-
ment. Verner is a hearty, likeable actor, and the
woes of Ireland are always in fair demand at
popular prices.

The little Cambridge Theatre was opened

A burst of hot weather almost persuaded
Rickards to despair of his show at Melb. Opera
House at the end of the first fortnight. Business
was not good enough, and ’Arry is too old at the

half the audience he had calculated on. However,
he valued Melbourne heat by Sydney experi-
ence, in this instance. The show was rushed again
as soon as the wind changed, and Rickards, the
pessimist, withdrew a number of remarks which
he made in his haste.

Looking after the Haunted Swing is no
sinecure billet. A MaoMahon, or a deputy, must
be always in the little room before the illusion
starts to work. Also, he is doomed to get upon
the swing every time and experience the sensation,
which custom doesn’t stale, along with the people
who are paying for it. One duty of the acting-
manager is to grab hold of anybody who attempts
to leave the swing whilst it seems to be in motion.
A pretty frequent trouble, too, is the cautious cus-
tomer, invariably of male persuasion, who thinks
he will just remain in the room and see how the
others like it before he ventures into the swing
himself. The management can’t explain matters
thoroughly to this cautious customer, so if he
declines to either seat himself or leave the
room it becomes necessary to “chuck him out.” At
Melbourne, the other day, operations had to be
suspended for about 15 minutes, all along of a 16-
stone ass who felt certain he knew how the swing
acted, but meant to stand beside it and make
sure.
THE HAUNTED SWING.
Fate sent an angel young and sweet,
A graceful, fawnlike, artless thing,
To sanctify a back-row seat
Beside me, on the Haunted Swing.
Up, up we went—or, so it seemed—
Until the ceiling came in sight;
The fair one caught my wrist and screamed.
O, ecstaoy of brief delight !
I live again, the while I sing,
That moment on the Haunted Swing.
Forgotten then my own alarm,
My secret fears had taken wing ;
Around her waist I slipt an arm
To hold her on the Haunted Swing.
And higher still we slowly rose—
Our heads passed underneath our feet.
I saw the angel’s eyelids close,
I heard her lips a prayer repeat.
Incited by her tender cling,
I kissed her on the Haunted Swing.
Not long may life’s illusions last;
Too soon she made an icy spring
From out my grip; she stared aghast
And left me on the Haunted Swing.
“ Mamma was in the outer room
We parted with a formal bow—
The heavens closed, and horrid gloom
Enwraps my love-lorn spirit now.
Except when Fancy deigns to bring
Me visions of that Haunted Swing.

That Yankee institution, the railway-ticket
“ scalper," has fairly settled down in Australia. He
lives chiefly on return tickets. The average return fare
is equal to one single fare and a-half, so on a journey
where the single fare is £5 the return is about £7 10s.
Therefore the scalper buys return tickets, sells one-half
at £4 10s., and sends the other half to the town at the
other end of the journey to be sold there for £4 10s.
Profit to each purchaser, 10s. ; profit to the scalper, £1
10s. ; dead loss to the Treasury, £2 on each transaction.
The drain doesn’t amount to much at present, but it is
bound to grow to large proportions, and though the
transfer of return tickets is nominally illegal, the law
seems a dead letter. The only visible remedy seems to be
the abolition of return tickets, and out of the saving
thus effected a small reduction in fares might be made
all round.

Melbourne City Council, which refuses to fix a
6s. minimum wage, the other day refused a tender for the
provision of horses, drays, and drivers, at 4s. lid. per day
for the set, on the ground that the price was too low.
T ie council has not the courage of its conviction, which
is that it is its duty to expend the ratepayers’ money to
the very best advantage, starve who may. The refusal of
this tender means that the council believes 12s. a week to
be too little for a common corporation laborer, which is
another lamentable proof of the growing prevalence of
pestiferous socialistic ideas.

Durham bullocks averaged £2l 6s. A rough estimate
gives the total exp uses so far at about £l2 per head, but
the alleged d cision of the London underwriters to im-
pose a 20 per cent, premium comes as a damper.

granted if the bank can show that it is likely to earn the
lesser amount. Mr. Loader seemingly believes in his

Last week three land-mortgages were effected in
Sydney, the mortgagors binding themselves to pay the
amount of the land-tax if that measure be carried, and
•the amount of the income-tax on the mortgagee’s profits
if a tax on incomes be carried. Once the tax is fixed,
however, this device will not avail the mortgagee ; for the
rate of interest is settled by factors independent of taxa-
tion, such as the quantitv of money seeking investment,
the character of security, the average of profits. In
Maoriland, where both land and income taxes are in
force, money is to be obtained from private holders
just as cheaply as in N.S. Wales, which as yet has neither

ably more than their premium income.

Some two years ago a Melb. trade-assignee, as
trustee in an estate which consisted partially of an un-
realisable brick-tower, 150 ft. high, hit on a scheme for
‘‘distributing ” it, with a certain villa residence and a
few hundred feet of ‘‘desirable allotments,” by means of
a consultation (styled a ‘‘Property Building Society.”)
The trade-assignee was chairman of the scheme, and
another accountant—a paid employ^—was appointed
secretary at the “ head office” in Brisbane. The show
was bust up on being declared illegal by an unsympathetic
Vic. Judge. The subscribers, after waiting some months,
are now clamoring lustily for return of their cash, or for
information as to what has become of it. The “ chair-
man” writes (from Hobart) that his “firm” “had
sent their account with vouchers to the society’s

moneys collected in Victoria. The ex-secretary simul-
taneously writes from Brisbane stating that ‘‘the chair-

the wall of the old man’s room. The old and distrusted
cashier puts it in the safe—which is also in the old man|s
room —every night, and it is transferred, without his
knowledge, and shitted back again in the morning. The
old man keeps all the keys. Some day either the cashier

“ The Lane ”is feeling bad. When a man was
doing a fair biz., some house he did not “do with ” would
promptlv start a rival—a man without capital—whose sole
aim would be turn-over. Cutting prices would begin, and
as the original man was trading on his own capital, he had
to cave in and leave the field to the other. Bad times
have changed this. Wholesale houses, with their own
credit restricted and discounts curtailed, cannot carry on
their puppets, and assignments are the orderof the day.
A shopkeeper, trustee of a church, latelv became

The gentle mortgagee was in evidence at the
Criminal Sessions, lately. He had distrained for interest

flaws in the warrant, retook some. Unfortunately, the
farmer was not well up in the black-letter law of Charles
11. -8 time, or he would have known that “ pound-breach’
is a common-law misdemeanour. The mortgagee had
civil remedies for any wrong done him, but to his mind
criminal remedies were good enough for such trash as a
defaulting borrower, and, of course, the farmer was com-
mitted for trial. But the Judge happened to have a little
common sense, and promptly quashed the information on a
technical point relating to the mortgagee’s power of dis-
traint under the Transfer of Land Act. Another warning

A jewellery firm, charged with the usual eva-
sion of duty,’’ is alleged by the Customs to have paid
duty during the last year on a total import of under
£l5. Said authorities now reckon that, hy invoices
seized, they can prove the firm to have imported £4OOO odd
worth of jewellery during the period in question, and to
have done the Treasury out of £lOOO in duty. The Cus-
toms got on the track through accidentally coming on a
secret and well-" planted ” consignment of gold watches,
&o. and not through any brilliant person being struck oy
the idea that £l5 worth of imports in a year was rather a
small amount for a firm which did a large trade in watches
and other goods of European and American manufacture.
The same obtuseness seems to characterise the authorities
of several provinces. If every important Customs House
had attached to it a person capable of drawing an infer-
ence to the effect that when one Arm imports, say, £lO,OOO
worth of goods in a year, another equally large firm in the
same line should import more than £lOO worth, quite a
lot of things might come to light. It is practically im-
possible for one firm to pay 25 per cent, duty, while ft is
undersold by half a dozen others which a fool of a depart-
ment allows to pay no duty at all. Smuggling, therefore,
becomes compulsory.

Dear Bulletin, —Your correspondent on “ joint
stock ” companies is "way off.” Anyone, for a shilling,
can, in Victoria, inspect the share-register of any limited
liability co. registered in Victoria, either at the titles-ofnce
or at the registered office of the co. The register has to
be corrected every 1% months at the Titles, but the daily
corrections are available at the company s office, and,
what is more, if the register is inaccurate or unavailable,
the searcher can lay an information and get half the
penalty inflicted for every day that the inaccuracy or
failure to produce has existed. I may add that in no part
of the world are the public facilities for investigating the
position of limited liability co’s. so cheap or simple as
they are h*ere t and it is a pity that this fact is not more

A venture that ought to have created a great
deal more talk is being quietly pushed in Ballarat. An
enterprising dozen have pegged out the whole of the
territory between Stiirt-street and Macarthur-streets
north of Creswick Road, and they are now trying to
induce the fickle capitalist to come in. This ground was
partly worked by several co.’s in the early days. One of
these was the famous Leviathan Don. At least seven dis-
tinct reefs are known to run through the strip of country,
and, granted sufficient capital, it is no doubt one of the
openings of the future.
The pall seems to have fairly settled over
Steightz. Week by week the number of companies at
work grows beautifully less. One reason for this is to be
found in the share-juggling carried on by legal managers

A healthy feature at Block 10 (8.H.) is that
sulphides from the 1215 ft. level are being treated with the

as rich nor as tractable as that from the higher levels, but
it nevertheless pays for treatment. Also, there is a good
body of it, which, it is practically certain, goes down to
limitless depths. Block Tens lately doubled in price in

Dear Bulletin,—.Re par. in your issue of Feb. 2.

expedition, though I can’t say what has been mopped up
by gas and flotation expenses. (2) The only money I got

about my alleged extravagance with this vast sum. (3) I
had the greatest difficulty in getting my scrip and agree-
ment, and when I did get them the agreement wasn’t
stamped or registered, and some of the scrip was in-
formal. (4) Money to pay for the camels was only sent
after long delay. (5) Money to provide for other neces-
saries of the expedition I only got three months after I
could have been in the field. (6) Money on account of
salary and for expenses caused by delay in Perth (not my
fault) was advanced me, and is accounted for. (7) A clause
of my agreement says the board of directors is liable to
me for the £4OOO subscribed. Is this the cause of the
"signals of distress?’’—Ernest Giles, Southern Cross,

That troublesome mineral, “bournonite,” though
seldom met in the main Sunlight and West Sunlight lode,
is plentiful in some of the outside reefs in these properties,
and forms the great bug-bear of the West in its Magazine
reef. Finer and more friable than antimony, it “ slimes ”
exasperatingly, and, as much of the gold is associated
with it, the loss is severe. Yet the Melb. board hangs fire
over the concentrating question.
The West Sunlight, like its neighbour, finds
mineral in the stone increase inordinately with depth.
The Sunlight enjoyed comparative immunity from mineral
down to its third level; then tailings which had hitherto
gone 4dwt. sprang suddenly to 16dwt., and free gold sank
from 15dwt to Bdwt. The co. abated its output and
worked as much as possible on stone from upper levels
throughout a long dispute with the freehold owners for a
reduction of 10 per cent, royalty in return for putting up
concentrating plant, and only since that w'as consum-
mated has it indulged in an unrestricted output from its
great reserves of highly mineralised stone.
Rather than lose gold freely, the West Sun-
light minager (himself a large owner in the mine)
seems disposed to hold his hand also and turn to surface
work and the comparatively clean stone of his new reefs
till profits accrue, or bankers unbend, or a concentrating
plant is obtainable. To work his Sunlight lode without
the latter is tantamount to seeking grapes from thistles.
The falling-off of free gold in the yields from the main
lode may dismay shareholders, but theirs can barely com-
pare with the manager’s dismay at the roll of real gold
down the creek.
Concentration is the “oriflamme” of gold-
mining in N.S.W. Out of concentrates must the owners
look to find their butter, assuming that the free gold
enables them to buy bread. In how many cases in the
province is free gold per se paying profits? There are
more just now than usually, and yet how few altogether,
and how strictly phenomenal are the chief instances :
Baker’s Creek, Wentworth Proprietary, Mount Drysdale,
the Bushman’s Hill (Parkes), which was nowhere till it
was on tribute, the Gibraltar (Adelong) with a century
between each div., and the Occidental (Cobar) with a few
long-drawn-out threepences.
The North Cornish (Daylesford) and South
German (Maldon) revolutionised their yields by the intro-
duction of vanners. Seven years ago there was not such a
device-of-the-devil as a Frue vanner in all Vic. The old
N. Cornish cautiously pioneered its introduction. The
original one quickly grew to 14, and the mine (which had
humbly endured the sterility of 3dwt. stone till its spirit
was broken) suddenly found itself shedding Is. monthly
divs.
The South German is of later and even more
brilliant growth. Chairman Grey, at Hi recent meeting,
announced that, of 19dwt. average saved per ton for the
half-year, lOdwt. was in free gold, but 9dwt. odd were
from pyrites.
The South German was having Is. monthly
divs. in the beginning of last year. It attained Is. fid.
midway in the year, and achieved 2s. before it closed.
The means employed were its own concentration and
chlorination plant, and an ever-vigilant yfbairman, never
off the spot.
Chlorination cost the South German .£1 6s. 9fo.
a ton for the last half of ’94. For the first half it was
reputed to have cost slightly over 245,
The sooner N.S.W. claims wake to the neces-
sity of chlorination plants of their own, the sooner will
div. notices be descried and the red flag bedizen various
poppet-heads in the bowels of the bush.

New Royal Standard, Stewart’s Brook (N.S.W.)
—32 tons for 1540 z.; vein six to seven inches. This is a
case of mining pluck rewarded, and is an example to
N.S.W. mining. Eight years ago the mine paid a few
divs., the gold-shoot was played out, and the co.
liquidated. A few of the original shareholders tackled a
1000 ft. tunnel and a rise of about Xsoft., and the mine is
on its feet again.

An Australian co., to be called the Vincent
Dredging Co., is being formed to acquire a lease on the
Olutha River, M.L. Tne claim immediately below got
130 oz. for one week ending 2nd Feb., and if the Vincent
reaches anything like this there is plenty of profit in the
venture. An average yield of only 3grs. gold to the ton
is estimated to give a clear profit of £lO,OOO a year. The
vendor takes £5OO in cash and the balance in ordinary
shares, while 10,003 preference shares of 10s. (4000 already
subscribed and 2000 exchanged for a dredge) are offered
to the public, with a prior claim of 10 per cent. dhs. per
annum on amounts paid up.
The question of the amount of compensa-
tion to be paid in connection with the deplorable
railway accident which occurred at Redfern,
Sydney, on 31st Got., ’94, has now reached a stage
of important public interest. Twelve people, in-
cluding a fireman and an engine-driver, were
killed, and some 18 were more or less injured.
The widows of the fireman and engine-driver
have been helped according to the system
prevailing in the Railway Department, by
which those dependent on officials who lose their
lives in the execution of their duty receive
compensation as an act of grace from the
Commissioners. The other 28 cases are cases
of the Railway Commissioners v. the injured
members of the public of N.S.W. Fourteen
have been already settled by the Commis-
sioners paying sums ranging from .£lOOO to £25.
As for the remaining 14 cases, the Commissioners,
in the public interest, are anxious to pay com-
pensation that will make generosity compatible
with justice. In several instances, however,
demands have been made which are considered
exorbitant, and the damages will probably have
to be decided at law.
A BEAUTIFUL COMPLEXION.
It has long been known to scientists that for
improving the appearance and beautifying tin-
face oatmeal is far and away superior to all other
foods, but it had one drawback—the tendency to
heat the blood. To overcome this defect the at-
tention of eminent scientists has been devoted to
the removal of this imperfection ; and now, after
long years of careful and diligent research, art has
triumphed, and Uncle Toby’s Rolled Oats is the
result, for, by skilful manipulation in the manu-
facture, all the heating properties have been ex-
tracted, so that now a beautiful complexion of
peach and ivory may be had by anyone who make*
a continuous use of Uncle Toby’s Rolled Oats.

MAN HIRSCH, the Vic. Single-tax Apostle.
The Earl of Pembroke writes to Louis
Becke that “By Reef and Palm” has been “a
blazing success ” in England. No other Aus-
tralian author has ever yet got for his work so
widespread and spontaneous a circulation.
According to Port Denison Times (Q.),
the prince of Australian Civil Service Pluralists is
F. W. Myles, of Bowen. This gentleman com-
bines in himself the offices of police magistrate,
clerk of petty sessions, gold warden, land com-
missioner, &c., &c., &0., to the number of 21
billets, for the modest remuneration of £330 per
annum.
Max Hirsch, the Single-tax apostle, was
born in 1852 at Cologne, and educated at the local
gymnasium; attended lectures at Berlin Univer-
sity. Went to England in ’72; then travelled for
English commercial houses over Europe, North
Africa, and Western Asia for six years. Came to
Australia in ’79, and, with the exception of two
years in Ceylon- has been here ever since. Was
converted to Single-tax by George’s “Progress
and Poverty,” and entered on propaganda in Cey-
lon in ’B9. On returning to Victoria, took the
lead of the Single-taxers and has retained it ever
since.
Countess Wachtmeister, who comes to Aus-
tralia to “boost up” Theosophy, is said to be a lady
of fascinating personality, and is the widow of a
late Swedish ambassador at the Court of St.
James. This ought to “ fetch ” society.
Bruce Smith must have been sadly dis-
appointed last week at being deprived of the
chance to cross-examine his parliamentary friend

Out of 200 appa-
rently sturdy Japs who
landed in Fiji last May,
as p’an tation -1 aborers, 92
have died of beri-beri, a

before their advent. As
the Jap Government is a
paternal one, that will
probably be the last ship-
ment of Japs to Fiji.
The S.A. Govt, is
looking for a suitable
island off the North
Coast in which to es-
tablish an asylum for
aboriginal lepers. Some
of the Northern Terri-
tory tribes are badly dry-
rotted with this disease-
no one knows how badly,
for it isn’t worth while
runningdown thediseased
nigger until there is some
place to put him after
capture. But, in a casual
sort of way, it has been
ascertained that some of
the tribes are very far
gone, and when the lazar-
houseis ready the “force”
will go out in pursuit of
the patients. Then there
will be some exciting
sport in the Far North,
for the fastest policeman
will catch the most lepers,
and the fastest leper will
get away from most pol ice-
men, in consequence of
which the slow leper will
be run in, and the slow
policeman won’t be pro-
moted. Someone ought
to go up North and run
a tote on the principal
events.
The great “M‘Meckan will-case” has now
taken another turn. It was expected, a few weeks
ago, that the matter would be settled by the
Privy Council one way or the other, but a new
trial has been ordered. A re-trial will' mean the
squandering of more thousands.
At the valedictory banquet to Gov. Hope-
tounin Western Vic. the otherday, aci vie magnate,

“ ’ls Hexcellency ’as been a real good man in

laying the foundations of young men.”
Lord Carington, it is stated, will be made
an earl on Queen’s Birthday, and will take the
title to which the first Lord Carington aspired
Wendover. It would really be wise for the
glorified stable-boy, Carington, to change his
name. > “ Carington ” reeks of Mount Rennie.
Somebody lately besought Parkes to make
it up with Dibbs. “Come to his room,” they
said. “ What!”exclaimed the cynical old warrior,
himself chilled‘by the blasts of political adversity,
“You don’t mean to tell me that Dibbs has a
room all to himself ! What does he do in it ?”
Baronet O’Loghlen had a rather rough
time in the Carlton South election. He was in-
terrupted whilst speaking at a recent meeting by
an illiterate and not too sober elector, who in-
quired insinuatingly, and with a diabolical leer—
“ Say, what about Nelly Proseky, ole man ? ”
Judge Windeyer, N.S.W. senior puisne
Judge, and first graduate of Sydney University,
has been elected as Chancellor in succession to the
late Mr. Justice Manning. Mr. Windeyer has
now but one more peak to climb. The Chief
Justiceship is his goal, but Judge Darley is tough.
To-Day, the pompous little English news-
paper run by J. Klapta Jerome, proposes to send
to young Hewison (who rescued his brother from a
shark at Newcastle, N.S.W., recently) “one of
our silver Pluck medals.” Highly commended by
the author of “ Three Men in a Boat ! ” Hewison
may as well die now : his life has reached its
climax.
Among N.S.W. Governors, Macquarie still
holds, and is likely for ever to hold, first place in
point of tenure of office. He bore the burden for
11 years, the nearest to him being Gipps and
Fitzroy, each with over eight years; then came
Loftus, Robinson, and others, with six or seven to
their credit.
A few days ago, Robert Orr, the veteran
Ballarat sportsman, while crossing the yard of his
bijou villa on the shores of Lake Wendouree,
tripped and fell, breaking three ribs in the fall.
Not all the years of cross-country riding in the
daredevil days of Lindsay Gordon, Holgate and
others, were able to break him up so badly.
The gritty Michael Davitt, holding the
same old saucer, is billed to reach Australia in a
couple of months. Davitt has done much solid
work for Labor, as well as for Ireland, and will
be well received here. It’s time, anyhow, that a
wild hurroosh was heard in the far-back town-
ships. Things have been very dull since John
Dillon worried round.
There is a delicious story about a Mel-
bourne genius who lately patented a more or less

and Several other potentates, and solemnly pro-
ceeded to unpack his sample

•). D. Rockefeller, of Standard oil fame,
the richest man in America, who is worth
.£30.000,000 ( not dollars), and has probably a
yearly income of .£3,000,000 sterling, is 55 years
of age, and, save for his heavy jaw, is in appear-
ance very like Frank Suttor, of N.S. W. He lives
simply and cleanly, is practically unknown per-
sonally to the world, is a great walker, never

institutions with millions, and is the financial
backbone of a big Baptist church.
Russian timber-merchants have written to
the Consulate in Melbourne for samples of red-
gum blocks. The late M. Poutiata wasn’t in
Melbourne a month before he forwarded to St.
Petersburg a glowing report of the red - gum
street-paving. It was the best he had seen in any
part of the world, he considered. He got seeds
from Baron Von Mueller, and talked of raising
eucalypti in the Caucasus as soon as possible.
Unfortunately, the little man couldn’t live to have
the pleasure of shipping the samples now applied
for, but if a timber-trade with Russia should
result the credit will be Poutiata’s.
Thus the London correspondent of S.A.
Advkhtiskr ; —“Lady Hopetoun’s action in
frigidly ignoring Lord Yarmouth after that foolish
young man’s idiotic gambols in feminine attire at
Hobart is said to have been cordially approved by
the Queen, who was much shocked at Lady Gor-
manston encouraging such tomfoolery. His
lordship appears, from our society papers, to excuse
the affair by blaming his hostess. He says he was
urged to the folly by her, and supposed the party
to be a private one. Lord Hertford likewise blames
Lord and Rady Gormanston. Yarmouth, he
points out, is only a boy, and not unnaturally
thought it all right to do what they approved.
Lord Hertford’s parent (or grandparent) was, you
may remember, said to be the original of
Thackeray’s ‘ Lord Steyne ;’ in fact, the portrait
of the latter in the first edition of ‘Vanity Fair ’
so strongly resembled the Marquis of Hertford of
that day that it had to be suppressed. Lord
Steyne, it may be recollected, had a penchant for
the ballet, and took up with a famous danseuse
after his quarrel with the bewitching Mrs. Raw-
don Crawley.”
Apropos of the recent cable re Cecil
Rhodes’ blackballing at the London Travel-
lers’ Club, and the consequent resignation
from the Club of the Prince of Wales
and other notabilities. “Rhodes is such a
bigwig now,” writes The Bulletin’s London
correspondent, “and his lieutenants derive so
much reflected glory from him, that Wales’
assiduous greaser, Somers Vine, is said to be
considering a scheme by which his chum,
the gilded Charley Gibson - Millar, shall annex
the Northern portion of Australia and run it
as ‘ Milleria. ’ It is said that Rhodes,
when Vine made a poor mouth about the ex-
pense the Imperial Institute would be put to in
consequence of a change of date of Jameson’s
lecture on Matabeleland (or Rhodesia, as the
country is now called) and the previous dinner at
which Tummy presided, said—‘Oh, don’t mind
expense-/ will pay everything.’ To a man who
has bitten hunks out of a continent, the idea of
a big institute not being aide to afford the few
pounds which were involved in making a change
in the date of a dinner seemed too absurd. And
so it was. But leave Vine alone for begging. He
never seems happy save when he is going round
with the hat.’’
H. H. Champion’s father, Major-General
Champion, died in England last week. He was a
doughty old warrior, and had fought in India and
in Afghanistan. Champion, an ex-artillery officer
himself, has a brother who is a captain in one of
the hussar regiments. He himself is still in Mel-
bourne, where he delivers occasional lectures. He
issaid to hanker after a newspaper in which he
may preach socialism.
Orator Bell, U.S., was in a false position,
lecturing in Melbourne, announced beforehand as
“One of the six greatest orators of America,”
wherefore everybody came to pick holes; for
while America is in many ways a glorious model,
the one thing hateful is its oratory, that purple-
patched laborious mosaic of Spreadeagleism where
all the tinkering ficelles are so painfully evident,
and everything is abominably unreal.
Of Lord “ Bill ” Beresford this yarn is
told. At an Indian Viceroy’s levee a second
Beresford, a snob, sought and obtained an in-
troduction to Lord Bill. “We are from the
same county, your lordship, so we might be
related, dontcherknow.” “ Quite possible,” quoth
Bill, genially; “of course I have no personal
knowledge on the subject, but I’ve heard it said
that my father was a perfect devil of a fellow in
his youth.”
It was the recently-deceased N.S. W.
Justice Manning who made use of the historic
expression about “ standing by a brother Judge.”
The words were uttered in connection with the
prosecution of a Sydney newspaper proprietor for
libelling one of the Judges. The present Chief
Justice, then at the Bar, said that the words
were unfortunate, and the newspapers would get
hold of them and use them to some purpose—and
the newspapers did.
Judge Backhouse, vice-chancellor of Syd-
ney University, vaulted over by Justice Windeyer
when the chancellorship fell vacant, did most of
the late chancellor’s duties for many years, and
was considered by many to possess a natural right
to the promotion. In Melbourne, the promotion
of vice-chancellor Brownless provoked scores of
battles ere it was realised. Deas-Thomson, chan-
cellor Manning’s predecessor, was promoted from
the vice-chancellorship.
“Lord Brassey,” The Bulletin reads,
“never goes on a cruise, however short, without
taking with him one or two elaborate typewriters
and a very costly barrel-organ. He plays on the
latter regularly for some time every evening, as
he finds it a congenial form of exercise and amuse-
ment. The former are used for duplicating the
ship’s log, a record of weather, and a concise but
often amusing narrative of his daily life at sea.”
Musician and litterateur ! How charming !
Josh Lake, the picture-agent man, tells a
horrifying story about Dr. Neild and the Deeming
case. Lake was under agreement with the Illus-
trated London News to send them sketches of
the trial. He enclosed a photo, of Dr. Neild, the
temporary Coroner, but forgot to label it. In due
time cheque arrived, and acknowledgment of
sketches received “and a photograph of Deem-
ing !” The little doctor was not to be exempt
from the Curse.
Fraser Smith, editor of Hong Kong Tele-
graph, is dead at last. He was a man of a thou-

THE TWO
GENUINE ARTICLED :
CLEMENTS TONIC,
FLETCHER’S PILLS,
IMITATED!
BUT UNRIVALLED
AND UNEQUALLED.
CLEMENTS TONIC is a scientific chemical
food and restores the tissue wasted by the voca-
tions of every-day life, is a prompt and safe
remedy for neuralgia, nervousness, weakness,
debility, liver complaint, dropsy, and chronic
indigestion.
FLETCHER’S PILLS cure heartburn, back-
ache, headache, liver torpidity, dyspepsia and all
complaints of the stomach and bowels.
These two remedies have been thoroughly
tested in all the hot countries of the world. They
are sold at a price within the reach of all people.
Evidence is forwarded free on receipt of name and
address that will satisfy the most sceptical as to
their virtues. They are sold everywhere, bub
care must be taken that the genuine are obtained,
or the money and time are wasted and the disease
made so much the more serious.

POLITICAL
POINTS
It is enough to make anti-Democrats
snigger when the man of “ hard-graft,” after a
short spell at law-making, settles down in a pub.
Both N.S. Wales and South Australia are
now without Governors, and Victoria will, in a
few weeks, also be “governed” by its Chief
Justice.
Gov. DufTs death spoils Premier Reid’s
little game of bluff. He hasn’t a promise of dis-
solution from Lieut.-Gov. Darley up his sleeve,
anyhow.
Under the M.L. Shop Assistants’ Act a
wife may assist her husband only if she is under
18 years of age—for then she counts as one of her
husband’s family !
Will Brassey, who crosses the ocean in his
own yacht, be invited to charge “expenses?” A
Victorian politician in Sydney last week said that
such an invitation will be made.
Vic. Commissioner Lochhead says that if
the population of Victoria were only 200,000
greater, the railway deficit would be wiped out.
A bonus on triplets might meet the difficulty.
The new N.S.W. Coalition party, at pre-
sent very far below the horizon, is bound to be
based on Federation alone. Federation is patriot-
ism, and patriotism is the last refuge of hungry
politicians.
The present Libel Act, which O’Sullivan
now tries to displace, was drafted and introduced
to N.S.W. Legislative Council by Richard Win-
deyer, father of the present Supreme Court Judge
of that name.
The New Woman canvassed vigorously for
the labor candidate—he was successful—at Carl-
ton, South Melb., even though there was a baronet
candidate. Unfortunately for the cause, the New
Woman is not kissable.
Sydney D.T. paragraph : —“As (diphthe-
ritic) anti-toxin can be readily obtained from Eng-
land, it is not intended for the present to pre-
pare it in the colony.” A perfect compendium of
the great Freetrade policy !
By making himself impossible as a consis-
tent member of any party and, at the same time,
destructively criticising all parties, J. P. Abbott
established an irrefragable claim on N.S.W.
Speakership. Dibbs, by persevering in present
practices, may similarly qualify himself for the
Agent-Generalship.
Job Boardman, over 80
years of age, who died last week
at Evans’Plains, near Bathurst,
N.S.W., was one of the first free
men to settle in that district.
Over 60 years ago he was coach-
man to General Stewart, who
had taken up his splendid grant
at Mount Pleasant, near Bat-
hurst, after a short term as
Acting-Governor of N.S.Wales
Boardman occupied a farm on
the Stewart estate at Evans’
Plains for 55 years.
A yarn of the “ 11 Bondo-
eani” class concerning Lord
Hopetoun. One day, while on
a visit to the Manifolds, he
went out shooting in Beeoh
Forest and got bushed. After
tramping about till he was very
tired and thirsty he came to a
small clearing, in the centre of
which was the humble home of
one of the Beech Forest settlers.
The mistress of the house —a
stalwart young woman with two
urchins clinging to her skirts —
came to the door in answer to
his knock. “ Will you be so
kind as to give me a cup of tea ?”
said his Excellency, smiling
affably. The young woman took
stock of her visitor, and, seeing
that he was a slender, quiet-
looking person, with no outward
signs of the Truculent Tramp
about him, replied, “Come
inside, mister, and sit down,”
She made some tea, and, while
he was drinking it, went into
the other room, “Did I scare
you away?” laughingly en-
quired the Governor when she
returned. “Not you, young
man,” she answered, drily, “ I
only went into the to
load the gun.” Then, observing
the look of astonishment on the
face of her guest, she added
apologetically—“No offence to
you, mister, but my husband's
away, and there’s such a lot of
bad characters prowlin’ about
these times that it’s always well
to be on the safe side.”
Several Sydney residents received during
the past few weeks enclosures of shamrocks per
mail from Ireland. In one case there was talk of
demanding an ad valorem duty on them, as such
goods are not mentioned in the specific schedules
of the Dibbs tariff.
The election of W. J. George, Opposition
candidate for the Murray, W.A., in nowise pleases
the Forrest crowd. George is a t’othersider (pay-
master on some big works in Vic. a few years
ago); an expert in figures ; and a nasty antagonist
for cooked finance to front.
“’Che great hobjection Hi take to Mr.
Reid is his hincompacity, his hinoapability of
comprehending the principles of hour Govern-
ment, and his hutter hindifference to the rules
which have been established for his guidance by
the wisest men hof our country, so long has he can
retain power.”— Parkes.
The head of a certain big firm, lately let
off with a heavy fine for defrauding the Customs,
is the smuggest stamp of professional Christian,
and staggers to church twice a Sunday with fab
Bible, upturned eyewhites, buried-grandmother
expression, and the whole box of pious tricks.
Let’s see — he can’t be put to the credit of “ that
godless education system ?”
Waddell, M.P., moves in N.S.W, As-
sembly against granting pensions to future Judges.
The Bulletin hopes to see the motion decisively
rejected, but trusts that some strong member will
begin and stick to an agitation for the appoint-
ment of all Judges and stipendiary magistrates on
some such terms and conditions as those fre-
quently indicated in these columns.
Q. Boodlewraith loves the Education
Department. It has retrenched that branch un
sparingly ; it is preparing the sharp axe of deno-
minationalism to lay at the root of the State-
school tree. The latest move is a quiet litth
request to parents to pay in a small, regular con
tribution towards school repairs. The thin end ol
the wedge to burst up free education.
“H.”: Charles Bright, in Cosmos, men-
tions that the first Victorian Parliament sat only
in the day-time. I was not aware of this, but have
often argued that Parliament should meet only in
business hours, like the U.S. Congress, the sittings
of which are denoted by the flag over the Capitol.
In these awful times why should men bring only
the fag-end of their minds to legislation?
Statistician Hayter has received his congd
from Vic. Government—being superannuated. He
will be succeeded by the officer next in command.
This comes as a relief to certain taxpayers who
considered it probable that ex-footballer Jack
Gardiner might be given Hayter’s shoes if Govt,
were compelled to cancel his appointment .as
storekeeper at Condah extension works.
Judge Hood (Vic.), in re yet another J.P.
case, has enunciated the rule that no man must
sit in judgment under circumstances which admit
of reasonable suspicion of bias. This is a highly
consoling view for unionists charged before
squatter justices—and a nice chance the unionists
have of getting its protection. The whole
“ honorary ” magistrate system is under suspicion
of bias, anyway.
Is it humor?' “ A retired draper’s assist-
ant named Wickens, aged 56,” says Sydney E.
News, “was taken to the hospital this morning
with a self-inflicted wound in his throat. He had
just received a bound volume of last year’s Han-
sard, and went into the sitting-room to peruse it.
His son coming in half an hour later found him

with his throat cut, bleeding profusely. The

‘Pmtem et circenses.” The N.S.W. un-
employed get every day from Govt, their daily
inead, and a circus whenever a Governor dies.
The empty parade at Gov. Duff’s funeral will cost
the State, say, £4ooo—including the expense of
special trains and parade-pay for the troops.

The omission of the little word “and ” in
Parkes’ letter to Sydney Telegraph spoils
the sense of the last paragraph. This should
read :
Hi make no secret of my desire bin the lasting mnterest

petent Ministry, and Hi hinvite men from hall sides who

Seeing that about half the board appointed
by Vic. Government to settle the minimum-wage
question were aggressive Tories, it was only to be
expected that “difficulties” would arise to pre-
vent anything genuine being done. The board’s
dissolution because of alleged inability to under-
stand what a minimum-wage means is absurd. A
(paid) Parliamentary Board would sit for a year
in order to understand anything. But the
V.M.W.B. was not a “paid ” board.
It is officially stated that the “ new and
humane ” N.S.W. prison gag is of “nickel-plated
steel,” but the Lasrland Govt, refuses to say how
many have been ordered, who is the manufacturer,
whether the gag is a patent one, and, if so, whether
the Govt, owns the patent. The Bulletin hopes
the Government does own it. If London Stock
Exchange only knew for certain that a patent gag
was amongst the Botany Bay State assets, Con-
victoria would be able to borrow at per cent.
The hungry Parkes’ vituperative allusions
to Treasurer Reid to-day are the same in spirit,
and often couched in the same words as his
allusions to Treasurer Holt, who held office in the
first N.S.W. Ministry. “Holt is a man,” cried
Parkes passim, “ remarkable only for crude
opinions, and who possesses no single qualification
for the successful conduct of public affairs.” It
must save a man a lot of mental work and worry
to find all his enemies so alike that one set of
epithets will fit the lot.
Baronet O’Loghlen took credit to himself
before a South Carlton meeting the other night
for being largely responsible for the so-called
“Rolls Purification Act,” which has politically
slaughtered so many democratic innocents. A
brave, but chuckle-headed, confession, and O’Logh-
len (beaten by the labor candidate) might have
expected the howl it raised. When the shrieks
had subsided, a terrible voice cried from the
back : “ You come here askin’ for our votes,
you ! an’ you’ve robbed us of them already.”
Fitz Gibbon came before Vic. Tariff Board
with his complaint re the tax on cement. There
are good reasons why all the cement required
should be made locally—there are also politico-
economical reasons. Cement is principally a
matter of labor—Vic. has at present a plethora of
unemployed labor. If the cement be obtained
abroad, the unemployed ha.ve to pay part of the
cost, somehow. If their labor be applied to
cement-making, they have at once the means of
living and of tax-paying. Therefore the cement
should be obtained locally.
Kingston’s caustic reply to Turner on the
reciprocity question was well-deserved, as far as
Victoria is concerned —but Turner’s responsibility
does not extend over the 30 years concerned in the
complaint. That Vic. has carried parochial pro-
tection to an absurd pitch is true, but S.A. fol-
lowed her with the Stock-tax, and this surely was
condonation to an extent. But the ethical, his-
torical and controversial issues should be buried.
The practical necessity is inter-Australian Free-
trade with Protection against the world.
The likelihood of Queensland standing out
from the first Federal Constitution is perhaps a
matter for no regret at all. America settled the
slave-question after the Union by a disastrous
method. Australia may think it expedient to
settle the slave-question before the Union.
N.S.W., Vic., and S.A. consume enough sugar to
give them great leverage in dealing with Queens-
land. If these sugar-consuming provinces insist
that the Kanaka difficulty shall be reformed out
of existence at once, and offer the alternative of
prohibition to Q. sugars, how can Queensland
stand out against them ?
A London paper enthusiastically remarks
re Victoria’s new Governor: “If Lord Brassey
can pull through a colony which has an enormous
internal debt and diminished resources he will be a
very clever man indeed.” To which Victoria —
which didn’t know before that Brassey was coming
out to pull the province through by his own un-
aided exertions, else it wouldn’t have reduced his
salary—cordially responds that he will. Evi-
dently Brassey was selected because he comes of a
family which is accustomed to shoving immense
loads on a wheelbarrow, and it was felt that the
occasion demands a man of muscle who can pull
things through.
The Price libel-case, in which Tom Price,
Labor M.P. (S. A.), was defendant and Cave & Co.
were prosecutors, ended in a nolle prosequi. There
was much excitement over the case in Adelaide,
as members of the prosecuting firm are among
the chief bolsters of S.A. National Ass. The
firm retained Symon, Q.C., and prosecuted Price
for criminal libel, instead of seeking damages
for slander civilly. They also applied for a special
jury, an unwarranted proceeding, promptly sat
on by Judge Bundey. The jury at the first trial
disagreed, and the case was to be tried again, but
Cave and Co. cried enough. Although it is
generally believed Price’s remarks were untrue,
public sympathy was entirely with him.
Angus Cameron’s notion of running a
Govt, tote on every racecourse in N.S.W., and
persecuting spurious imitations with the utmost
rigor of the law, is admittedly the noblest notion
that erratic member has struck for a long time.
Founded on a sound principle, too —the principle
that Govt, should regulate and profit by habits of
the natural man which it can’t prevent. The
Bulletin’s hat is up for Angus as first Minister
for Totes. Why shouldn’t all the other social evils
be dealt with in the same wny? Why not John
Kidd, Minister for Pubs., and Joe Cook, Minister
for —well, Sunday stools, if you like?
Ex-Mayor Manning looks
forward after his trip to Eng-
land to a Treasurership in a
N.S. Wales Protectionist Go-
vernment, as promised by
Dibbs.
Mr. Knox, of the Colonial
Sugar Co., says : “In re the
Civil service, compared with
private business, N.S.W. Go-
vernment pays 25 per cent,
more wages for 25 per cent,
less work.” Whereupon Syd-
ney Sunday Times: “Knox
is perfectly right
What a scandal it is on the
country when an authority
like Knox can say that the
Civil service costs double what
<t should.” But then Knox
Qidn’t say that, or anything
like it. He says that the pri-
vate employe does £lOO worth
of work for £1(;0, while the
State employe does 25 per
cent, less—that is, £75 worth
of work for 25 per cent, more
money, which is £125. Even
in the bright lexicon of gro-
cery journalism twice £75 is
not £125, or anywhere near it.
It should interest N.S. W. gaol authorities
to know that no corporal punishment whatever is
permitted in the prisons of Japan. One prison
there maintains an average of over 2000 criminals,
and, according to the latest report, the strictest
discipline is preserved merely by employing- a
sliding-scale of food and confinement.
“Oobden and Bright were cuckoos, who
plundered Villiers of his credit as the father of
Freetrade.”— Randolph Churchill.
“A Sunless Heart ” (sent The Bulletin
by Ward, Look and Bowden) is a morbid feminine
novel, displaying some originality and imaginative
power, but of little interest and without permanent
virtue. The gruesome characters occasionally
strain themselves to the point of impressiveness,
but the general tone of t ie book is one of crude
unreality. Under these circumstances, it is not
surprising to find that the conventional Ensdish
press professes to be greatly struck with “AS m-
less Heart.” Mr. Stead, in particular, reffrs to
“the singular glow and genius of its author,”
having naturally found the episode of the outraged
12-year-old girl peculiarly attractive.
Mrs. Threlfall (wife of Professor Threlfall,
of Sydney University), whose “Starlight Songs ”
have just been published in Eng and, disposes not
undexterously of the old poetic properties. H*T
references to love and the spring, to sun, moon
and stars, to day and night, leaves and roses, sky
and sea, are made with a fluency and melody which
are frequently far to seek. Two or three of her
pieces “ Waltz Music,” “Fern Tree Spring,”
and the address to baby “C.R F.T.”—are specially
worth commending. The first-named, which
originally appeared in The Bulletin, aptly weds
fine thought to musical v use, and is most effective
of alb The second (also from The Bulletin) is
not improved by the ch nge from melodious
“Wyoming” to “rougher “ Fern Tree Spring,’’
but has a sweet, haunting cadence of its own. In
the pretty lines to “C.R.F.T.” the images are
natural, if not novel, and the ideas are sufficiently
strong. Occasionally Mrs. Threlfall’s verse has
less meaning than melody, but to a sympathetic
soul her little book is fitted to give much pleasure.
The thirty-ninth anniversary of the Mel-
bourne Eight-Hours movement is announced to
be held at Melbourne Exhibition on 22nd April
proximo. The great feature of the festival will be
the art union, in connection with which prizes to
the value of ,£1650 will be distributed. There are
six cash prizes for the following substantial sums :
■£7oo, <£2oo, .£lOO, £OO, £3O, and £2O. Tickets
may be purchased in all the leading Australian
cities and in Tasmania ; and the amiable secretary,
Mr. Charles Harris, will be happy to furnish any
and every information on application.
Mr. W. T. Foxlee, who was engineer-in-
chief for N.S.W. existing railways, after five
years’ service, left With his family for England,
per Rome, on 2nd inst. He was first engaged as
deputy-engineer at £BOO per annum, but since
Sept., '9l, has been chief at £l2OO. Though
pressed by the Commissioners to re-engage, he
declined, as be wished to establish himself as a
consulting-engineer in England. His action in
resigning so substantial a post affords a useful
commentary on a recent N.S.W. Assembly dis-
cussion. Mr. Foxlee, who was universally re-
garded by his professional brethren as a most
brilliant engineer, had the value of his services
assessed at £3OO a year by several all-wise legisla-
tors—of the kind who, if they were A.M.P. policy-
holders, would like to cut the salary of Secretary
Teece from £2500 to £250.

The most stalwart instrument of torture
yet invented for use in Sydney is the big bass
hour-hell of the General Post-office, christened
“Great Parkes” by the ever-cornplimentary Dan.
O’Connor. On the day of Gov. Duff’s funeral
this bell tolled at minute-intervals with a marrow-
freezingness which may possibly be rivalled but
can never be ou'done by the Last Trump
itself. Life or death, in fifty out of a hundred
serious cases of illness, is merely a matter of
nerve Let the practice of tolling “.Great
Parkes " at “ important ” funerals once be firmly
established and 10 per cent, will at once be added
to the city an 1 suburban mortality. It’s true that
a Governor does not die every day, but don’t let
it be imagined for a single moment that, now that
“Great Parkes ” has proved himself such a hair-
raiser, his blastiferous bom-bom will be reserved
exclusively for dead viceroys. Great Parkes, it
may safely be predicted, will yet slay his scores
and hundreds at the obsequies of every civically-
glorified publican, and pig-slayer, and tin-pot
politician.

The references made by Gov. Hopetoun,
in his farewell speeches, to the wife of his bosom,
have a certain pathos. “ Lady Hopetoun has
been perfectly happy here since she has come to
understand the country.” The real truth is that
the poor woman’s life has been a burden to her.
She wasn’t built for being ogled and criticised and
made public property of, and seemed to suffer cold
shivers down the back whenever she was forced to
assume a gtaciousness she did not feel towards the
undoubted “lydies” who, for the most part, con-
stitute Melb. “ society.” Lady Hopetoun’s
“GOOD FORM IN CYCLING."—From “Life."
eooiety smile was harder than that of a China
doll. It was a smile that looked as though it
would crack if touched, or as if it were the out-
side of a refrigerating chamber. Everything
colonial went against Lady Hopetoun. She could
not even take up a newspaper withoutencountering
some offensive paragraph about the development
of the pork and bacon industry.
# * ' #
“You know I was very young when I
came to Australia,” said Hopetoun pathetically
at the Sydney banquet. The Bulletin has been
under this impression for a long time, only it
didn’t like to mention it. By the way, Lord
Hopetoun is still young.

The ladies’ cricket-match, at East Melb.
ground, was a thing to see once and make a note
of for future warning. Proceedings opened with
a thrill of disappointment. When Captain Trott
led her team into the field they were found to be
dressed to kill, in the natural and barbarous sense
of the term. From neck to waist their figures
were bags of mystery, whilst the outward visible
skirt was a dreary tract of white flannelette ex-
tending to the ankles, or further. Enough black
stocking to emphasize the easy fit of the white
shoes, and a straw hat with a blue or red ribbon
round it, completed each sad picture. A faint
touch of humor was supplied by the wicket-
keeper’s pads, but otherwise the entertainment
seemed anxious to be taken seriously. The
wicket-keeper may have been intended as a low
comedian, feigning exaggerated respect for the
bowling. She didn’t need pads. The lob trundlers,
as a rule, barely succeeded in putting on enough
pace to kill a fly at 18 yards—the length of a
ladies’cricket-pitch. The round-arm artistes, whose
delivery was suspicious, restricted themselves to
slow “wides.” Under such bowling conditions,
the batting of Miss May M'Donnell could only
shine by comparison with the wondrous awkward-
ness of her rival sloggers. Percy M'Donnell’s
sister represents lady cricket at its best seemingly,
and she couldn’t vanquish a smart 12-year-old hoy
in a single-wicket match. But the girls, here and
there, disproved the ancient assertion that they
catch husbands more easily than they can grab a
flying missile. Also, one or more of them threw
the ball about in vigorous, manly style. These
were bright exceptions. It the leather wobbled
to the boundary —the boundary, by the way, was
adapted to the occasion—it usually travelled back
to the impatient Richardson by easy stages.
Several darlings formed an irregular line and
gently passed it on.
# # #
The female cricketers aforesaid presented
the ball with which they played to Lady Hope-
toun, “as a memento of the first ladies’cricket-
match played in Australia.” Now, it wasn’t the,
first ladies’ match played in Australia; and, in
the second place, what species of lunacy or
egotism was it that prompted the giving of a dirty
piece of leather to a woman who is about to leave
the country ? Do the female cricketers flatter
their silly selves that Hersee Hope, Opuntess of
Hopetoun, is going to wear that battered buffi
next her heart to hurt John Adrien Louis’ manly
chest when he bestows upon her the fond embrace?
Not much !

The Melb. female cricketers are negotiat-
ing for a match with their Sydney sisters.
Four “ladies of the theatrical ” profession*
j i- , . , . , , 1 , ■
dressed in natural togs, invaded pious and ciroum
speot Geelong on a recent Sunday, and simply
paralysed Mrs. Grundy—who lives at Geelong—
by racing round the town, exhibiting their knioker-
bookers and their ballet-legs to elderly married
gentlemen coming home from church. Elderly
gentlemen in Geelong are not used to that kind of
thing, and the shock to the system is expected to
have a disastrous effect—perhaps the re-establish-
ment of burlesque in that frost-bitten town. A
mothers’meeting has been called to consider the
matter.
AN EDITOR'S TROUBLES.
BORE : “Are you the editor? Well, I
want you to give me the answer
to this riddle—A man is looking
at a photo, on the wall and ad-
dresses it thus, ‘ Uncles, brothers,
cousins have I none, but -."
[Then something happens .]
“ Rational Dress ” showed up at Melb.
Princess’s Theatre one night last week in the form
of four shapely-limbed damsels clad in cycling
garb and riding “ bikes ” astride. The effect was
distinctly pleasing, and the straight-out develop-
ment of well rounded, tweed-draped leg decidedly
preferable to the lace-edged suggestiveness of a
previous exhibition of the same class. But the
free length of stocking displayed accentuates one
fact. The universal knioker will only be a favorite
with the possessors of good calves. The owners
of pipe-stem extremities below the_ knee had
better stick to the enshrouding skirt, which
leaves all to the imagination.
In the Sydney breach-of-promise case,
O’Donnell (milliner) v. Doherty (civil servant),
Judge Backhouse remarked that two years of
plaintiff’s life had been wasted in the engagement,
and verdicted for £2oo—which definitely fixes the
value of “ middle-class ” blighted affections at
£lOO per annum, or £1 16s. Bd. per week. But
the Judge was very much astray when he called
engagement - time wasted. Certainly the girl
generally wastes away in the process, if it be pro-
tracted long enough ; but consider the usual com-
pensations—the tender gurglings into her shelly
ear, the thrilling hand-clasps, the melting glances!
And then the kisses, the fierce, rapturous
squeezes !—not to mention the moonlight rambles,
and so on. “Waste of time,” indeed! Judge
Backhouse must be getting old.

Wilkinson’s will has been up again before
Melb. Full Court, which upholds it in giving the
property to the Salvation Army as against the
widow. Such a victory is worse than a defeat,
and takes more money out of pocket than it puts
in. Here is the widow, beggared at law by an
allegedly religious body, left at their mercy.
Cases often occur in the secular world where a
legatee refuses to accept if he thinks an injustice
lias been done, but religions are not built that
way.

That Narandera (N.S.W.) hospital-case,
in which a patient died, allegedly through the
neglect of an attendant to supply him with beef-

Some miserable and almost incredible
stories reacli The Bulletin re Coolgardie
typhoid. For instance ;
A man named Brockman was, on or about 9th Feb.,
taken ill in his tent, which is located on the West h uindary
line of the township. The police were at once applied to
for relief, and in town all the authorities were approached
with the facts of the case, but all to no purpose. He died
a week afterwards during the night in a very unclean
state, unattended by nurse, doctor, friend, or clergy.
Then the authorities provided a coffin, into which they
y packed the poor clay, just as he breathed his last, and
hurried him underground without an inquest or anything
to betray the fact of there being the remains of a fellow
man Inside their official box. And they have allowed hU
tent to remain in the filthy state he died In, greatly to
the risk, dread And annoyance of the people living ill the
immediate vlolulty. It is supposed he died from typhoid
fever. Strange we have so much fever where the authori-
ties are so careful in their sanitary arrangi ments, isn't it?
Why don't tire diggers straighten up thou©
“authorities,” or create better ones? Oaidt
pressure be brought to bear on the Town domicil
—or is the fashion in Coolgardie that easy Auo-
tralian fashion of leaving all the unpleasant jobs
to “ the Government ” — i.e„ the pohoe?

A case of castor-oil and a case of salad-oil
were among the “ rations ” requisitioned for a
certain State-fed labor settlement. Enquiry
elici ed the information that “the ladies uses it
for their ’air.”
Lawyers prefer
men to women liti-
gants, though, of
course, they like all
kinds. A solicitor,
called upon “in re a
gent one” by the
Court, and shown to
have preyed upon a
female client, thus
put the ease: “Ask
any s Heitor of the
Court what women
are. Women are most
unsatisfactory. I
generally refuse to act
for them altogether
now. I have never
had a row with a
man over my man-
agement of his affairs.
As regards women, I
have had quarrels
with nearly every one
I have had to deal
with. Nearly every
solicitor yet born
would say the same.”
And a court-full of
lawyers grinned en-
dorsement.

It is stated that
one reason for the
appointment of Mr.
James Vicars, of Syd-
ney, to be City Sur-
veyor of Adelaide, is
that he is engaged to
the daughter of an
Adelaide alderman.
He gives up .£4OO a
year to take a less
salary, and this makes
his choice all the more
galling to applicants
now without billets.
Twenty cases of fever had to be refused
admission to Coolgardie hospital, in the last week
of February, for want of. room. One came from
Mount Margaret (120 miles) and two from
Kurnalpi (65 miles). Another case was “dumped 1 '
down by a teamster at the hospital secretary’s
door, in Bayley-st., and there was nothing for it
but to take the sick man into the office. This
being the actual state of things, it is hard to
believe that the Govt, is doing its duty by the
unfortunate of the gold-hunters.

At Coolgardie “all drinks” have been
lowered to 9d., and, The Bulletin’s informant
adds, “there is some talk of their coming down
to 6d.”

None of the ladies concerned in the
“society” libel-case —Lange v. Bage—in Mel-
bourne are very pretty, and nearly all have a passion
for dowdy and frumpish clothes. Mrs. Gertrude
Bage (wife of defendant) and Mrs. Sachs© (wife of
the Legislative Councillor) are twin sisters—tiny
little women with sharp features and thin, firm
lips. The young widow, Mrs. Edward Bage, is
buxom, and facially more attractive than any of
the other members of the family. It is, by the
way, a somewhat remarkable and not unpleasing
feature of the case that, since the action was
brought, Mrs. Lange, the plaintiff, has (so goes the
story) made a new will, under which she leaves
her large fortune to be divided equally between
her six children, including those who are concerned
against her in this case.
« » #
The Melb. public are being edified just at
present by the Lange libel-case revelations of life
at Oxford—where they won’t let “Second Mrs.
Tanqueray ” be played for fear it should corrupt
the undergraduates ! And yet a good many
mammas would be horrified were it suggested
that their own medical school is a very pro-
mising microcosm of the classic mother of cads
and puppies.

A recent alleged Vic. defaulter and his
wife would have got clean away but for their love
for their pet dog. It was a beauty, and the lady

At Bathurst (N.S.W.) recently, a man,

Mr. “Dick” Meagher’s sartorially gay
appearance before N.S.W. Justice Windeyer in a
recent capital case has led to the N.S.W. Judges
ordering that no minor practitioner of any sort
shall appear before the Court unless clothed in
black gown and snow-white “bands.”
“THE NOBLE ART.”
Man of Tracts (log): “Rash man, by frequenting these
degrading resorts, what condition are you in to meet
the Great Unknown?”
BLUDCER SMASHEM (the pug) : “Condition! Well, Pll tell yer —
I was up all larst Friday night darncing, and on the
Sat dy I gets as drunk as blazes, and in the night I fights
a dror with the ‘ Pyrmont Stranger ’for 20 rounds. So
that’ll show you wot sort o’ condition I’m in. You jest
bring along your Great Unknown.”
The vogue in Smellbourne just now is the
Christian Endeavour Picnic down the Bay, It
promises “ healthful Christian relaxation, no
dancing, no intoxicants, and sacred selections.”
As far as The Bulletin has been able to learn,
most of the male Christian Endeavour is expended
in the healthful Christian relaxation of trying to
entice the maiden Christian EndeAvourers into
shady nooks along the beach. The scriptural in-
junction, “ Lover one another,” is worked for all
it is worth.
Victorian W.C.T.U. publishes on its pro-

Rev. W. G. Taylor, a Sydney Wesleyan
parson, just returned from a begging tour round
the world, brags that he received promises of
.£3730, of which .£2184 has been paid. His ex-
penses were <£B63 —nearly 40 per cent, of cash
received to date, which would be reckoned a
pretty stiff commission outside of evangelical
circles. The whole performance is a disgrace to
the church, seeing that Australians are the richest
community in the world in proportion to popula-
tion ; and the failure to get the required “ beans”
locally shows how little real grip religion of the
sustentation-fund variety has upon the rationalistic
cornstalk.

“ Fired two shots over his head, and, as
he wouldn’t stop : shot him in the leg.” If this
doesn’t simply mean two misses and a chance hit,
it means good judgment and good shooting. But
the constable who can make decently sure of dis-
abling instead of killing, is too lonely a pheno-
menon to justify the fire-arming of the policeman
who aims with the back of his neck.

A N.S. W. State-school
inspector, on visiting a
northern school, found that
the teacher had neglected
his records for three
months. He was about to
report the pedagogue, but
mercifully decided to give
him another chance. At
next visit the inspector
found that matters stood
as on the former occasion,
and remarked : “ I let you
off last time, but I shall
really have to report you
now.” “You’re not game,”
replied the teacher, “if you
did I’d report you for
neglecting your duty be-
fore.” The inspector wrote
out the report, handed it
to the teacher to read, and
asked the latter to accom-
pany him to the P. 0.,
which he did. Ejaculating
“I’m not game!” the
inspector dropped the letter
into the box. The teacher
was dismissed, and the
inspector censured. These
are the teachers who make
it hard for others in the
service.

Justice Windeyer de-
fines cruelty, in a divorce-
court sense, as “ assault
and battery.” English di-
vorce - courts long ago
decided that a man may
be found guilty of cruelty
who maintains an un-
broken and contemptuous
silence towards his wife.
The latter may not be
N.S.W. law, but it is sheer
common-sense.
Unvarnished advb. from Melb. Argus :
ly/TIDDLE-AGED gentleman, good position and in-
M come, having little time and less inclination for
frequenting ball or concert-rooms, garden-parties and
other assemblages where marriageable women are
usually on view, takes this means of making his
wants known. He desires to meet a suitable lady,
spinster or childless widow, age 21 to 45, with private
means. Write in fullest confidence to Lothair, Post-
office, South Yarra.
Nice husband the writer of that advt. will make 1

Dear Bulletin, “Australia
for the Australians.” While canvass-
ing recently a back-block town, the
inhabitants whereof are of assorted
types, I received a bad snub. It
happened this way. At one shop
where I attempted business I was—
man is but mortal ! —fairly over-
whelmed by the personal appearance
of its young mistress—in short, I
coveted my neighbour’s wife. Pre-
sently there entered from the back
premises the “mister” of the estab-
lishment, and as I looked from him
to his better-half, huge scales dropped
from my eyes. The woman, who a
moment before I had regarded as the
embodiment of each and every fas-
cination, now seemed to me to be
the possessor of every repellent
quality. Sensuality and wickedness
I could read in her every look and
feature. Her husband was a China-
man ! A few moments later I stood
in another shop a few doors higher
up the same street, conversing with
the matronly proprietress, and had
to await the return of her lord and
master ere proceeding with my busi-
ness. Naturally my thoughts reverted
to the Chink’s bride, and I remarked
to Mrs. that it was a pity such
a fine-looking woman had thrown
herself away on a “ Chow ” —at which
remark my listener fired up, and in
a tone of voice which made me feel as
though 1 was switched with nettles,
“ supposed that Mrs. So-and-So could
please herself; anyway, a Chinaman
was quite as good as an Australian any
day.” With this unexpected sentiment
I could not agree, butthelookwhichaccompaniedits
delivery warned me that it would be unwise on my
part to debate the matter with a lady whose temper
now blazed from her eyeballs. A light was cast on
her championship of the “heathen Chinee” by
the entrance of Mr. Blank —for he was a black-
fellow ! —O., N.S.W., l/3/’95.
In N.S.W. country court. Before his
Honor the Acting-Judge, Judge (to counsel,
sternly): “Did I hear you say, sir, that Judges
usually behave with courtesy towards the Bar .
Counsel: “I did, your Honor.” Judge (indig-
nantly) : “ How dare you make such an assertion,
sir? Unless you withdraw it and apologise I
shall adjourn the court.” Counsel: “Your Honor,
I regret to have made such an imputation ; and
now that your Honor has shown its impropriety,
I willingly withdraw it.” (Scene ends, and har-
mony once more prevails.)

There’s some queer reasoning over this
venom-proof business. Shires is proof because he
has been several times bitten ! But, as he eouldn t
have been bitten before the first time, why
shouldn’t he have survived the first bite because
he is constitutionally immune, and all the other
bites for the same reason ?

A N.Q. drapery clan boasts a son and heir,
who was at Cambridge with everyone worth men-
tioning, and was quoted, some months ago, as the
prospective brother-in-law of a peregrinating
nobleman. Young Haberdashery has only a few
years returned to the bosom of his family, who,
’tis said, are disappointed to find that his sole
ambition is to live down the accusation of “ purse-
proud parvenu,” or “ gilded counter-jumper.” In
pursuance of this idea, he dresses shabbily, and at
society functions sits about in a fat way, showing
as much gone-over tan-boot and wrinkled sock as
possible. Judging from appearances, he cuts off
his shirt cuffs to avoid any suspicion of vulgar
ostentation, and if, as some people think, he
sleeps in his hat, it is, no doubt, with a view to
depriving it of its aspect of shoddy spruceness.

It is the proper caper now, if you happen
to be rich and desirous of catching a Lord to more
or less temporarily adorn your household, to throw
your net as far as Albany. There is now such a
demand for Lords in Australia that they are
actually “ sold to arrive.”

S.A. Wesleyan Conference recently affirmed
that the State should not encourage the wine
industry, as it destroyed the morals of the com-
munity. On the day this resolution was carried a
citizen found a slug eight feet long in his water-
tap ; and, the two paragraphs duly appearing side
by side, the moral was so obvious that Adelaide is
still as unsober as usual.
DISILLUSIONISED.
[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
I marked the whiteness of her satin skin
And saw, too late, the making-up begin ;
I played with tresses of a golden sheen,
And knew not that another’s they had been ;
Pearls flashed on me from lips of coral hue ;
The pearls were false, the lips by nature blue ;
The splendid figure that my arm had graced,
Above was padded, and below tight-laced ;
In short—my idol was not gold, but clay,
And I have learnt the bitter truth to-day.
Gunned ah.

Mr. P. Johnson, Australian Hotel, Yass, N.S.W.,
who writes on June 7th* 1893 As a matter ot
justice I think it is nothing but right that I should
add my testimonial to the great curative properties
of Clements Tonic". I have been using it for the
last two years. Hotel-keeping entails a great loss
of sleep, and consequently there are other disagree-
ables attached to it. As I have been in business
for a number of years, I consider there is nobody
better able to speak on the subject than I am.
The symptoms brought on by overwork and want
of rest were the following:—Loss of appetite; and
extreme nervousness ; I also found that my eye-
sight was impaired, that is, when I attempted
to look at anything it seemed to be moving. I had
tried every remedy in my own house without
deriving any benefit from them. Seeing Clements
Tonic advertised so much in the local newspapers,
I started taking it, and found from the first bottle
that I regained my usual rest, in fact it \yas a
perfect stimulant or invigorator when I was quite
unstrung from want of rest; I am still using it
and intend doing so, it is the best pick-me-up in
the world, and as an appetiser it be
equalled.—l remain, yours, &c., P. Johnson, Aus-
tralian Hotel, Yass, N.S.W.

saved me much misery from colonial fevers, indi-
gestion and impaired appetite to which I have
been subject during 11 years’ residence in the
tropics. It is invaluable to travellers as a pre-

' Edward Solomon, composer of “The Vicar of Bray,*’
died the other day. He had much of Arthur (Solomon)
Sullivan’s talent, but very little of his training. Sullivan
got his grounding in classical music as an Abbey chorister,

had sung in bis young days at Evans’ supper-rooms. He
wasn’t quite forty when he died.
M‘Q.: Saw little Ada Delroy in the serpentine-dance at
Melb. Opera House the other night. She’s the cleverest
that has shown at Melb. so far, bar none, and gets effects
with the sticks in her skirts that neither Mary Weir nor
any of the imported girls approached. The only jar-
ring note was the eternal portrait of Her Gracious thrown
on the front of her skirt at the end of her evolutions.
Ada is too shapely to be disfigured thus.
Addie Conyers, at latest dates, was ablaze with dia-

says The Bulletin’s correspondent, but she must have a
better adviser than poor Cellier was. She was far too
exigeante last time.
Williamson and Musgrove have smiled upon Australian
art. The tableaux-vivants at Melb. Princess include re-
presentations of F. M’Cubbin’s picture “Down on his
Luck,” and “Eight Hours,” a piece of statuary by the
clever young sculptor, B. E. Mackennal, now in Paris.
Elwood, whom Dion Boucicault has just brought to this
country, and who made his Australian d£but at Sydney
Lyceum as David Reraon, the blighted astronomer, in
“ The Masqueraders,” is a mummer of experience. In
April, ’9l, he created the part of Ejlert Lovborg, the
arrant literary poseur who twines vine-leaves in his hair,
in Ibsen’s “Hedda Gablerand, according to one critic,
he made the “ hit of the evening ” as Philip Tenby in
Haddon Chambers’s great failure “The Honourable Her-
bert.” Mr. Elwood played one of the gallants (Salanio)
with playright Pinero (Salarino), who was then mum-
ming', in Henry Irving’s production of “Shylock” at
London Lyceum in ’79.
Signora Majeroni has had the same aversion to her sons
following the stage which marked Kean, Macready, Yates,
Vandenhofl, Jefferson, and Irving. What embittered her
more than anything was the lack of appreciation of the
really superb talent of her husband, the noble Eduardo,
as tine a character as ever adorned the boards. However,
George Majeroni proves worthy of the father’s socks and
buskins, and now Mario Majeroni has come out, even
stronger, to prove that Scotch College education
was only intended for young G. V. Brookes or Barry
Sullivans.
Mrs. L. L. Lewis, Rosa Dunn of yore, decided to unmis-
takeably challenge public recollection in the prominent
r6le she took the other day with some Melb. amateurs.
In Mario Majeroni she had a lover 30 years her junior,
and yet the audience were not particularly struck by
the incongruous, although she hardly took the pains to
make-up. The snowing of age only appeared in stiffness
and angularity, but she was strangely amateurish, even
to the teapot attitude.
Melbournian : “In my suburb, some showman got up %
successful kind of illumi ated f6te last night, in the
Public Gardens—with brass band, horse-jumping, Punch
and Judy, roundabouts, &c. Only to-day it transpires to
have been for the funds of the Church of England. Circus
soon.
Many American States are legislating against high hats
in the theatres. We have many cases of Jones or others
versus the Crown, but the high hat is not abated.
During “Romeo and Juliet,” at Dunedin, Romeo
Greenaway had backed off and Juliet Flora Ross re-
appeared to lure that beauteous youth back again. She
called for him, but, instead of Greenaway, an understudy-
stalked on in the shape of a large mastiff. Juliet wanted!
to know wherefore he was Romeo ; but, before he could-
explain, an arm (presumably Tybalt’s) shot out from the-
prompt side, and he was collared by the scruff of the neck
and exiled ignominiously. Then the real Romeo came on,
and the audience wiped away a tear.
Emery has more than the ghost of a show, opening
Melb. Cambridge as a vaudeville theatre, for little plays.
There is the precedent of the triple bill in London, and
Emery had American experience with Wilson Barrett’s
similar programme, through one-night stands.
Maggie Moore’s first night of “Struck Oil ” drew the
largest house ever seen in Broken Hill.
Another fete for the benefit of the Distressed Actors'
Fund is to agitate Melbourne in May, when the new
Gaiety Co. ladies will be on the spot. A gorgeous fgte,
conducted on the most improved principles as regards;
booth, barriers, and beauty show, and with plenty of
genuine entertainment included. For the matter of which
a cup of tea from a pretty actress is also a genuine enter-
tainment. Life is mostly made up of vanities far less
pleasing.
Claude Hermann, the tall and deserving music-hall
vocalist, whose voice has deserted him in the hour of
trouble, was to take a benefit at the Victoria, Melb., on
Wednesday night of this week, the purpose of the ben.
being, in the first place, to pay his passage back to Eng-
land. Elton, Shine, Marie Luella, and many other pros,
put their names on the bill ; also, Isidore Kosminsky, a.
bright young amateur, promised to do a kindly act for
the good cause.
A certain Australian variety entertainment will soon
lose the good name it started with if the latitude of a
certain indifferent comedian is not curtailed in some
degree. The coarsely-disgusting strikes a responsive
chord in none but the few vicious schoolboys and ancient
satyrs.
Janet Achurch had arranged to come to Australia again
with hubby Charrington, when Elizabeth Robbins, who
has bought the English rights of Ibsen’s “ Little Eyolf,”
offered her the leading female part in it. Janet then
cancelled the Australian engagement; but it is only
deferred.
A Melb. paper says that W. and M., in their new series;
of living pictures, have, in their anxiety to placate Mrs.
Grundy, “ quite covered up the interest in one or two
pictures that might otherwise have been telling.” The
interest? But, as Gautier says, if there is any nakedness
in a picture or a book, certain virtuous people go straight
to it like swine to the mire.
The ever-popular Fillis, now in S. Africa, has turned
over his circus to a limited co., and intends building, at-
Johannesberg, the finest circus and theatre combined
ever seen that side of the globe. His luck lately has
been Al.
F.: “ Has it been noted how close a resemblance
‘Sweet Marie’ bears to ‘Wearing of the Green?’ As
Elton-Fourcanade says about something in ‘ Esther
Sandraz’ —the air is the same though the phrasing may
be different. ‘ Sweet Marie ’ may be a plagiarism, or a
complimentary imitation, or an independent work—and
the same thing may be said about Gordon’s alleged piracy
from Byron. . . Melody and poetry still defy the
dictionary—and musicians are not very bold with theories.
But ‘ popular melodies’ are born in shame—are the un-
recognised children of hasty, thoughtless passion. What
the ‘ squib ’ is among racers the popular song is in music.
It runs lame after a splendid half-furlong. . . This is
the place to restore a distorted aphorism to shape: Let
me write all the laws of a nation and I will take care no
one sings its popular songs.”
The critics vote Grundy’s “Slaves of the Ring” un-
satisfactory. The plot deals with a marital “ hard case.”
A. and Mrs. B. are in love, but B. loves Mrs. 8., and A. is
loved by Mrs. A. Three acts pass in mutual torments.
and—nothing follows. Everybody stays in the path of
virtue; everybody is "as you were.” The knot is no
nearer untying at the evening’s end than at the begin-
ning. Consequently, people go home now from
London Garrick with an uneasy feeling that their evening
has been wasted. There is nothing so aggravating to the
average person as a play which marks time for three
hours and doesn’t “ get any forrarder.”
Max O’Rell’s book on the kawlinies has reached its 17th
edition in Paris and its 30th thousand in London. Max
admits his income is about £2500 a year, and is making
his farewell tour of America, where he is to deliver 100
lectures at 200 dollars each. This is better than teaching
irregular verbs.
Edith Bland, of the beauteous form and sweeping stride,
is in London looking for an opening.
Miss Talbot, one of the B. and B. new actresses, played
the Countess of Ripstow in Edward Terry’s first pro-
duction of “ The Times.” Miss Talbot does well, but cer-
tainly no bettsr than Miss Romer, who, in The Bulletin’s
opinion, was the best “oldlady ” Australia has seen for
a long time.
Henrietta Watson is the daughter of a North of England
theatrical manager.
“ The Importance of being Earnest ” is the title of
Oscar Wilde’s latest comedy.
Ada Delroy, now of Melb. Opera House, whose portrait
The Bulletin published last week, claims to be
absolutely the originator of the overdone “ serpentine ”
dance. She says she got the idea years ago from a nautch
girl in the palace of the Rajah of Putiala, and danced it
on the West Coast of South America, long before Loie
Fuller was heard of.
SPORTING NOTIONS.
“The new bowlers, A, E. Trott and M’Kibbin,
were certainly out-classed.’’—Argus.
BrockwelPs narrative of the Englishmen’s
wicket tour is very dry hash. He doesn’t even offer a
reason why some of them, including himself, fall short of
their English batting average on the easy Australian
wickets, w hereas others, notably Stoddart, score so much
more heavilj’ here than at ’Ome. There are many
points of difference between Austra ian and English
halting, although the difference in results is very small.
Our fellows seem to play a heurt-hreaking game. They
keep the ball down, and score freely off clever taps.
The Englishmen show a superiority in the art of placing
their hits, and, generally speaking, lay more “ wood ” on,
but their play is always uppish by comparison with
the Australians, and, therefore, less trying to the
patience of the field. Brockwell has nothing to
:say on this matter. Cricketing experts note an
effect, which may be quite as apparent to non players as
to the recognised authorities, but they don’t find the
cause. Perhaps there is a double cause for the compara-
tive uppishness of English batting—the frequency of bad
wickets, where quiet safe play is out of the question, and
the rule of three-day matches. If a county eleven win
the toss and want to win a game they don’t hang on to
’their first innings as though time were no object.
* * » *
The North Tasmanians soon took the measure
of Humphreys’ iobs. His record for their first innings
was 98 runs -10 wickets. Second innings—47 runs—no
wickets. But Humphreys was brought out chiefly as a
curiosity.
• * * *
A difference which always strikes an English
visitor to Australian cricket-grounds is the absence of
printed cards at the fall of each wicket, and the up-to-
date poet. Both are advantages. In the one case the
raucous cries of “ krect kyard o’ mitch” from myriad
juvenile throats, and the necessity of paying Id. every
time one wishes to be up-to-date are done away with, and
in the other one is not subjected to the torture of the
irrepressible “A. Oraig ” reading doggerel odes from
inside the ring on conspicuous incidents of the play. As
a rule, the Australian onlooker is more comfortably pro-
vided for and gets better cricket for his money than his
English brother.
* * * *
As an example of the all-engrossingness of the
final test-match: two New Guinea pearl-fishers took a
month’s holiday and visited Melb. for the sole purpose of
seeing Stoddart taken down, while dozens of bronzed
Coolgardians pervaded the Block during the few days
preceding the match.
* * * *
“Giffen is indeed a wonderful horse to be able
to win the Champion, make 260 not out, run 100 yards in
9secs., kick 10 goals in one quarter, carry off the Austral
wheel race, beat Billy Beach, and make a break of 4000 1”
That’s the sort of nightmare they have down South,
just now. It is the disease of “sports” suffering a
recovery.
• » ♦ ♦
One of Sydney’s finest batsmen dreamt, on the
might before the last day of the deciding test-match, that
Australia lost—through a wonderful stand made by two
■of the Englishmen. He communicated his dream to a
few friends, who barracked badly when Stoddart’s wicket
fell in the first over of the day, but later on they looked
■upon their dreaming friend as a prophet risen up indeed,
to see visions and dream dreams, and to tell of ohe Fate
to come. This batsman has more than once had a dream
before an important match ; has dreamt that he made a
big score the next day, and has gone in as one inspired by
Providence and has warmed opposing bowling as if
it were schoolgirls’ stuff. As a dreamer, he has not yet
been caught asleep.
• ♦ * ♦
“The Australian spectator of cricket,” says
Brockwell, “is impatient and intolerant because he is
overstrung.” ■ That is bad. “ All nervousness points
■deathward.”
♦ ♦ ♦ ♦
No Australian team should visit England until
at least one first-class bowler has come forward. At
present our best men are only fit for change bowlers.
• * * *
Miss M. M‘Donnell (sister of Percy) made 62,
wot out, in the Melb. ladies’ cricket-match—scoring 18
runs more than the whole opposing eleven. If this lady
■continues to show such good form, her chances of in-
clusion in the next Australian representative team will be
very rosy.
Some fMnellbournites’ ideas of “ sport ” and a
fair ttst, during the last England v. Australia crioket-
match, consisted in telephoning urgent messages from
the members’ pavilion to the Observatory, when the
English were making a stand in the last innings, asking
fit nun might be expected! A chorus of jubilation greeted
Ellery s (as usual fallacious) reply that a downpour might
be looked for in two hours. In effect— 11 Only let us win
never mind how.”
* * • *
George Giffen says he will go to England with
the next Australian Eleven. It is to be hoped George
will not make Walter Giffen his price next time.
• ♦ ♦ *
Joe Darling, the S. A. crack left-hander, is very
anxious to be in the next Eleven for ’Ome, as it would be
the making of his cricket business, and,., moreover, his
father, Darling, ex-M.L.0., has promised him t’soo for
expenses. Joe has given up football in view of his cricket
prospects.

The English team’s match against Northern
Tasmania was drawn for want of time, scores, Tas., 178
and 219 ; Eng., Ist innings only, 291. The Englishmen
didn t bother about loading for bear, though the local
team was very much in earnest, and played for all it was
worth. In the match against Southern Tasmania the
foreigners hardly bothered to hit the ball, and only made
91 in a first innings. The local men then went in and
made 189 for 13 wickets, when the match died of inanition.
Great offence was given by the failure of Stoddart and the
other non-professionals to turn up at lunch on either of
the two days.
'* • • *
Dear Bulletin, —I often read that these inter-
national cricket-matches serve strengthen “those
bonds," and to “draw us closer,” &c., &c. Now, the
effect observed by me on the E. Melb. ground during the
five days of the last contest was decidedly otherwise. The
spirit engendered is fiercely partisan, and the Australian
sentiment comes out on top with a decidedly anti-British
flavor, expressed in bloodthirsty Australian patois. It
may not be particularly rational, but is certainly more
healthy and convincing than the hybrid Imperialistic
emotions with which the respectable right-thinking press
endows young Australia.—Yours, S.S.

Sydney D.T. ridicules cricket enthusiasts and
enthusiasms. In the same issue five columns are devoted
to a report of the test cricket-match, while only 2J cols,
are given to the proceedings of both Houses of N.S.VV.
Parliament, and only 1J cols, to the proceedings of the
Wesleyan and Presbyterian Conferences combined.

N.S.W. autumn campaign begins this week
with Rosehill meeling. For each day the management
has good entries. The comparatively small acceptance
for Rosehill Stakes is to be regretted, but yet over ten
horses may be seen at the post, of which Moorefield,
Playmate, and Bethel should provide the winner. Bat-
talion, His Reverence, and Pharamond read most dan-
gerous for Rosehill Cup, which bids fair to blossom into a
race of some importance.
* * * *
The time-honored Hawkesbury meeting will be
well patronised, coming as it does again before the A. J.C.
fixture. Euroka, Spinning Jenny, Division, and Aeolus
have accepted for the Rowley Mile, and the first nam'd,
a hummer at a mile, may win. The Handicap shows
Burton, Aeolus, and Division as having good chances.
A first glance at the weights for the Doncaster
Handicap and Sydney Cup points to the undeniably strong
hands held by Messrs. Kelso, Payten, and Forrester, and
if to their representatives we" add Lady Trenton and
Loyalty, N.S.W. horses will probably be capable of keep-
ing these two valuable prizes in that province. Gaillardia
will be the most dangerous visitor.

Unlucky Idolater! Third in the Newmarket
Handicap; led into the straight in Australian Cup and
didn’t get a drum, and third in Free Handicap, at Y.R.C.
meeting. At the V.A.O.J. he ran second to lolanthus in
the big event, and was left at the post in the Ventr.y
Stakes through the machine not acting, but even then
ran fourth.

Nordenfeldt’s stock accounted for four good
races at the big Melb. meeting, a fact that should gladden
the heart of Mr. S. Hordern. 'Twas about time the pro-
geny of this high-priced sire showed up in winning form
—and as something more imposing than ponies.
♦ • * »
The “complete list of Carbine’s performances”
is no doubt a fine and well-arranged bit of statistical
work, but spoilt by excuses made by the compiler
for the races in which his hero was beaten. No
excuse is needed for any horse, even a Carbine,
being beaten by the aptly-named Marvel over a
mile; the ideal Abercorn over a mile and a-half; or
the bulldog Melos over three miles. As well might the
editor of Form at a Glance compile a list of Progress’
performances, and say that if Grand Flaneur had not
been foaled the same year, Progress would have won all
his races.

The fate of Surcingle and Killarney in the

The programme for the V.R 0. “ Complimen-
tary Meeting to Lord Hopetoun,” due on March 23rd, is
choice reading. It contains six events, all of them dedi-
cated to the vice-regal personage and family. The Hope
Stakes, named after the Earl’s heir, Lord Hope, if you
please ; the Neddy Hurdle Race—Neddy being another of
the family titles : the Holywell Steeplechase : the Ormis-
ton Handicap, which suggests that Hopey is more or less
related to old Mrs. ’Ormiston Chant, the social purist:
the Countess of Hopetoun’s Bracelet Stakes : and the
Hopetoun Cup. The V.A.T.C. was less lavish with its
compliments, but the farewell bill of Saturday (16th) in-
cluded a Hopetoun Handicap, and a Ventry Stakes, in
honor of the Countess’s papa. Strange to say, neither
club thought of presenting a Mullins Purse.
♦ ♦ ♦ ♦
A Melb. bookmaker seriously proposed to pay
only half wagers over the Australian Cup, as the stakes
had been reduced owing to the time-limit not being
equalled. “ Why, said he, “if bets foller stakes, only arf-
bets foller arf-stakes.”
* * * *
The Y.R.C. now decrees that every horse shall
be entered by his owner, and does not permit of the old
method of “ nominating.” The senior partner of a Melb.
firm owns a rather good ’chaser, but not wanting his own
name to figure on the “card,” gets one of his employes
(who hardly knowsahorse from a camel) to sign the entry-
form. The is, consequently, harassed greatly
by touts anxious to know whether his neddy is fit or not.
It won a race the other day, and since then he has been
continually assailed with reproaches by his friends for not
having put them on the good thing.
Albert, you were once a hero,
Hero much too hot to last—
Now your fame is down to zero.
As a bowler you’re “ outclassed.”
E’en the Monarch’s late lamented
Spouse’s shade began to pale,
Loyal subjects went demented
Over Austral’s batting “ tail.”
Papers praised your scoring splendid
Here and o’er the briny main,
When another match had ended
Albert stock was down again.
Had the world beheld your equal
In respect of skill and pluck?
Not until it heard the sequel—
“ Albert Trott has made a ‘ duck.’"
Found to-day and lost to-morrow
Are the idols of the crowd ;
Wisdom strikes its roots in sorrow,
Cricket-star behind a cloud.
Albert, you are jet a learner,
Quite a newchum on the earth:
’When you grow as old as Turner
You will know what fame is w orth.
Then you’ll stand aside and ponder
On the rot of cricket writ,
You, the recent vaunted “ wonder,”
Who “can’t bowl a little bit.”
Knowing then the fickle million,
If, perchance, they wildly cheer
.As you march from the pavilion,
Calmly raise your cap—and sneer.

THE property of the Company consists of a
mining lease for 21 years of 45 acres of river
and bank, extending about a mile in length of the
Clutha (or Molyneux) River, at Clyde Township,
Vincent County, Otago, New Zealand. The
claim is moat highly reported upon as BEING
ONE OF THE BEST ON THE RIVER FOR
GOLD DREDGING, and capable of yielding
EXCEEDINGLY RICH RESULTS. It is
situated in what is known as the old lake beds,
just below the rocky gorges of the river at Clyde,
where the rich alluvial fiats (through which the
river runs some seven miles) begin.
This form of gold-winning is one of the most
profitable in the colonies, and, as will be seen, the
mode of working is singularly cheap, the cost uf
management being made dependent upon profits.
The profitable nature of this investment is
shown by the following facts, and, taking into
consideration the known returns, it is but a ques-
tion of RAISING THE QUANTITY OF
MATERIAL AND TREATING IT EFFEC-
TUALLY to get surprising results. To enable
this to be done, it is necessary to obtain a dredge
and machinery of the latest and most approved
design, eschewing all obsolete and worn-out plant,
A steam dredge of latest pattern will raise from
eighty to one hundred tons of stuff per hour, and,
taking the lower amount (80 tons), it is equivalent
to 576,000 tons per year of three hundred working
days. Reckoning the minimum amount of gold
obtained from each ton as three grains (equal to
sixpence) IT GIVES A RETURN OF 3Goooz.
GOLD WON —SAY .£14,000.
The Directors have been fortunate in securing
the offer, of a powerful steel dredge (nearly new)
for the sum of £lOOO (one-fourth its value), to be
paid for in Preferential Shares. This will absorb
2000 shares, leaving 4000 to be issued to the public
to provide for placing dredge on the Claim, and
the necessary preliminary incidental expenses.
The cost of working, repairs,
oil, fuel, wear and tear and
depreciation of plant, &c., is
covered by £4O per week ...
Office expenses, Melbourne and
New Zealand, say...
and for services of management,
on net returns.
Wit!) a greater quantity of material raised, and
a larger percentage of gold won (six grains being
considered a very low return), the profits will
show in increasing proportion. .
The returns from dredges working in adjoining
claims give from 30 to over 100 oz. per week, anil,
with the improved plant to be purchased, there is
every reason to believe that from 80 to 100 oz. per
week should be obtained from this claim.
It is proposed to utilise the tailings, which
hitherto have been wasted, and by efficient treat-
ment they will bring in additional profit. China-
men, by their crude system, are making good
returns from discarded tailings.
The large amount of attention now being
directed to this form of investment has caused
nearly all the most valuable sites to be secured,
and leases, before long, will become of very con-
siderable value. ... , ...
I Immediately the necessary capital is subscribed
the plant can be placed on the claim, wheh returtis
will be immediately forthcoming.
( It is considered by experts that there is suffi-
cient ground and depth of material to keep a
dredge going for the full term of the lease, the
quantity of stuff being practically inexhaustible.
It is not expected that more than six shillings
per share will be required on the present issue of
Sh As illustrating the advantages offered by Prefer-
ence Shares, it may be instanced as follows :
Say Preference Shares are paid up to 2s. 6d. per
share, then they are entitled to first charge on
dividends to the extent of 3d. per share per

annum, after which they rank equally with the
paid-up shares irrespective of the amount paid per
share. It will be seen that the ordinary shares
paid for Vendor’s interest do not participate in
dividends until Preference Shareholders are paid
at rate of Ten per cent, per annum, and after that
only equally with other shares irrespective of
amount paid up.
One great advantage that claims special notice
is that Lignite, for fuel, can be obtained close at
hand for from 13s. to 15s. per ton. The consump-
tion is three tons per day of twenty-four hours.

The epic about a jockey who loses to order and
never blabs is not yet written. To lose, to be suspended
bv the stewards, to be repudiated by the owner for being
found out, and, after all, not to blab—this surely is a
net-tain kind of heroism. Loyalty to the owner is usually
not hard to overtask. But the dog-fidelity which returns
faithful service and silent loyalty for lies and insult this
sometimes is discovered in a shrivelled jockey^

Six riders in the Newmarket were Melb. Cup
winners. *
On the day of the Newmarket a certain bookie,
of unsavory reputation, anxiously awaited the result of
the race afar off. A fellow metaliician prepared a nice
surprise. “ Bill,” he said, “ Bill, I’m ruined—Yanitas!
“ Vanitas ? ” said Bill. “My God, I’m a broker-1 can’t
pay out! ” He disappeared and emerged awhile later
from his hotel apartments with all his trunks packed.
“ Don’t say a word, Jedediah,” he whispered, “ but I’m
landed for £5OOO, and I’m going to clear right out.”
“What struck for five thou, by the Laundress? said
Jedediah. “ The Laundress 1 " blurted out the bookie.
“ I’m a millionaire. This is a free pub. all night at my
expense! ” * * *
How many Australian bookies pay out when
the favorite comes home ? In some cases the liability is
not cleared off lor months. The writer knows one pro-
minent Southern bookmaker who, when he recently got a
skinner over the Newmarket, paid a prominent mining-
man £5OO balance of a heavy wager over Fortunatus’
Standish Handicap. The name would surprise the public.
After all, it isn’t the bookies’ fault. Busted boomsters
still bet, but they don’t pay up.

Why claim that Slavin is now “as good as ever”
because he has beaten Craig ? The latter defeated
Pritchard, but so did Jim Hall. That leaves Slavin much
as he was. And it must not be forgotten that Hall went

ntfianly assault, or the pug. who in cowardly fashion
p iramelled a youth who couldn't fight, there are scores
of professional and ex-professional boxers like Jackson,
Pdev Choynski, Jem Hall, Tom Williams and others who
live decent lives, and, knowing their strength, restrain
it. The best-known Australian boxers are all men who
have never seriously offended against the law.

A tug-of-war between the Fitzroy lorry-drivers

Vir. 19min. The Fitzroy men gained 2ft. in the first

The recent boating accident at Perth, whereby
four well-known gentlemen were drowned, and a similar
accident on the same day in M.L., where an artist with
his wife and child went under, both arose through a puff
striking the sail while the sheet was fast. The tendency
to make fast the.sheet, to save the trouble of holding it,
seems to be incurable. Every sailing man knows the
danger of this practice, but everyone reckons that the
puff isn’t coming just then. And in most cases it does
come just then, and only then.

The third edition of the pamphlet on
Sharp’s new Cannalin remedies for piles is now
ready—free copies on application to the depot for
Australasia, 257 George-street, Sydney. Note.—
These remedies have cured where operation and
all other means have failed.*
As a universal antiseptic and disinfec-
tant there are few things which have so
enduring a reputation as Oondy’s Fluid. It
can be used internally or externally. It kills
microbes, destroys foul or decomposing matters,
and, while itself free from odour, it obliterates all
manner of unpleasant smells. For horses it is a
most valuable remedy in cases of thrush, grease,
cracked heels, abcesses, ulcers, sore shoulders or
backs, wounds, farcy, glanders, and eye diseases.
It is strongly recommended for distemper in dogs,
likewise for sores, canker, ulcerations, worms,
mange and bites, and it is a useful wash
for animals whose doggy odor is too pronounced
for comfort. In the case of cattle, it does good
service in black quarter, sores, murrain, rinder-
pest, catarrh, cowpox, foot and mouth disease,
pleuro-pneumonia, &c ; it cures rot, scab and fly
in sheep; hog typhus, diseases of cats, poultry,
cage birds, &e., and kills parasites on plants, and
is of value in many other ways. A pamphlet,
giving full instructions for use, is enclosed in the
wrapper of each bottle.
When all her old-time heroes are for-
gotten, and the kilt is extinct, and the bag- pipes
have exploded, and the pibroch is dead, and the
name of Mac. has dropped into oblivion, Scotland
will still be famous as the place where they make
the best whisky that ever gladdened the soul of
man. Scotch whisky is old and historic, and a
thing to be treated with reverence. One Scotch
distillery, that of Rankin and Son, has been turn-
ing out the well-known Kilmarnock whisky for
115 years, and all that time its reputation has
been steadily growing. The local agents for this
historic liquor (Metayer and Co., of 8 O'Connell-
street, Sydney) announce that in future it will
be published in ordinary round bottles instead
of the rather fragile flat ones as hitherto, but
otherwise there will be no change, save that the
liquor will grow still better with extreme old age.
The “extra special ” whisky of this firm is known
by the “ ship brand ”on the label. Metayer and
Co. are also agents for Gonzalez and Co.’s brandy,
a well-known brand of high repute which has
gained sundry gold medals for its excellence, and
for Ihler and Bell’s Guinness stout, another liquor
which is a dreadful stumbling-block in the path of
prohibition.

Th® recent Oavlll-MoUings swimming me®
for the 100 d yards’ amateur ohftmplonshlb ot N.B.
Wales was ft eontest between a game bey who
taught himself to swim, and a sinewy young
athlete, trained by brothers who aro leading pro-
fessionals, and ft father who swam the English
Channel on the night this son was born. A man
can swim 1000 yards with confidence when he
knows that his whole family, if thrown into the
middle of the North Sea, on a cold, dark night,
would in all probability get ashore somehow.
Seen before the race, Hellings related
how he learnt to swim, in Woolloomoo-
loo Bay, Sydney, when he was five years
old, Low he used to paddle on a plank
all over the Bay; how he bathed regu-
larly in its open waters, with his brothers,
for 14 years, without once seeing a shark;
how he five times steered the Sydney
(ight-oar crew in interprovincial con-
t< sts, and how, “ worse luck,” the best
1 lace he had steered into was second.
He first raced Cavill when he was
i even jears old. The course was 50
5 ards, and Cavill won ; three times after
that they swam the same distance, and
three times Cavill was beaten. This
season they raced over the different
distances of 100, 200, and 500 yards.
In the 100 yards’ race Cavill was third ;
Hellings, who came first, established the
Australian costume-record—viz., Imin.
5 l-ssec., and in a private trial, with-
out costume, he equalled Gormly’s record
for a similar test by swimming the 100
yards in Imin. 2 2 ssec. The 200 yards
race he won from Cavill by two yards;
the 500 yards he lost by a “ touch ”
it was the severest race of his life;
he knew nothing for the last lap —his
senses were spinning; the shouts of the
excited crowd, heard through the water
rushing round his ears, were only an in-
distinct buzzing. He was lifted out,
“done for.” He twisted his knee play-
ing football last year; if he walks for
three or four miles now it gives way
under him. His trainer, rubbing him
down with bare hands in the dressing-
lox, ex; label that “Jack” had had
but three weeks’ training, but both Hel-
lings and his trainer spoke with cheery
confidence of the result. But the boy
had small chance against the human
seal in the box near by who spends his
days half in the water, half in the
sun.
Mr. “ Tom ” Slattery, the presenter of the
prize, a gold-medal, came at 9.30 p.m. He stood,
pistol in hand, beside the boys. “Are you
ready ?” he shouted. Bang 1 The boys went off
with the pistol, and Ernest Cavill, the big pro-
fessional of the family, rose from amid the
Cavil! circle and stood on the bath-edge to coach
his man and brother.
Up and down, down and up, the boys swam
together at great pace. There were other com-
petitors ; but nobody saw them. All interest was
concentrated in Hellings and Cavill as they
struggled side by side. And all the time Ernest
Cavill directed the tussle with a wave of the hand.
There was a moral in the scene. He did not
share in the travail of the toilers ; but he
made their struggle bitterer by a stroke of the
finger; he did not feel the pain and weakness
which Hellings did, when, long before the dis-
tance had been swum, the boy’s tiring limbs gave
out their last ounce of strength and his plucky
heart could pump no more blood into the ex-
hausted muscles. No ! the fat man sat down then
and smiled. The fat man had won. He always
does—anyhow, he wins so often that the other
fellow’s successes “ don’t make no difference.”
Hellings had tired first in the right fore-arm,
next in both thighs, then in every muscle of his
body. Talking after the race, Ernest Cavill said
that in “Turns,” as his brother is familiarly
called, the family had a world-beater for all dis-
tances from 100 yards to one mile. “ I think he
will be the best swimmer of our family, if he is
not so now; he is only 18 years old. After the
race he was as fresh as a lark.”
All honor to young Cavill; though one’s sym-
pathies go naturally with the beaten Hellings.
For, as one of the crowd put it, “I cheer the
winner; but I’d like to walk home with Jack.”
“ Few women oar® for the ballet.” One.
“ Let no“woman marry a man who cannot
on his wedding-day pin a life-insurance policy on

freak in fleece, out from a black sheep which
repented, and turned white immediately. The
change of colour is so abrupt that the wool seems
to have been dyed half-way up from the skin.

“ Fireside and Camp - Fire Song ai d
Story” (sent to The Bulletin by Geo. Robertson
and Co.) is a collection of verses of slight interest
and no value—the work of H. J. White, an
elderly Adelaide gentleman, who seems, like Mr.
Wegg, to naturally “ drop into poetry.”
A fight in a Sydney street arose the other
day from a man saying “Norway and Sweden.”
A red-headed, long flaxen-bearded man passing
interjected, “Schsveden und Norvay.” And
thereupon the patriots went at it, Schsveden und
Norvay coming out on top at the finish.
The Year-Book of Australia, for 1895,
is a more invaluable publication than ever, if that
be possible. The editor doesn’t) merely hash up
the Govt, statistical authorities, but collates and
tabulates his information and figures at firsthand,
and the current issue takes one up to June 30, ’94
—which is six months ahead of Coghlan’s latest
deliverance, and from six to 18 months ahead of
Hayter, who, on some points, is a very far back
number. The insurance and banking section of
the Year-Book is very full and interesting ; and
the chapters which deal with art, music and the
drama, with education and with sport, together
with the reviews of every branch of Austra-
lian industry, are remarkable for telling ex-
actly what one wants to know in the
fewest possible words. In this year’s special
prize essay, James '.Smith discusses “ Viti-
culture and Wine Production ” in the weighty
fashion which the subject deserves. There is also
an eloquent map of each province (though one
looks in vain upon that of N.S.W. for Wyalong);
and the volume now comprises 723 pp. of very
sound literature. Altogether the 1895 Year-Book
deserves unqualified praise, and reaches in its
line about the highest excellence which it is pos-
sible for a single volume to attain.
On Victoria Bridge, Brisbane, a toll of Id.
is levied upon every foot-passenger. The same
charge is also fixed upon pigs and goats. The
praiseworthy modesty of the Brisbane public is
apparent to the meanest intellect.

than by any other investments.”
Essentials to Success 'with. Patents. —(1.) A good and novel invention. (2.) Capital to
protect and develop the invention. (3.) Experience in appraising the intrinsic merits of an invention,
its prospects of success, and, after securing protection, in developing and introducing it on the world’s

COMPANY is projected to provide the third equally
The success attending the privately conducted PATENT INVESTMENTS Nos. 1 and 2, and
u n “ merc ? UB flattering applications from inventors and investors alike, convinces the management
that there is room for the extension of its operations over a much wider field than was at first contem-
plated.
The Company’s modus operandi is as follows: Selecting the first essential, viz., “a good and
novel invention,” from amongst the many offered for examination, the Company invites subscriptions
to a development fund —in this case of ,£lOOO in 1000 shares of ,£1 each. This provides the second
essential, “ Capital to develop and protect the invention.”
The business relations established throughout the world in dealing with their other valuable
patents, and the experience of the Company’s officers and experts afford the third essential, “ Business
Management. ’
The Management can confidently recommend their No. 3 investment to subscribers as a thoroughly
safe speculation, and one certain to bring in very handsome returns. It is anticipated that the sales
of patent rights and licenses to manufacture the invention selected (which is an article of everyday use
in every household) will produce a nett return of from one to three million pounds sterling, and that
it will commence to pay handsomely immediately the patents are fully secured, giving a dividend
exceeding the original subscription within six months.
It is intended to secure patents in every part of the world. The funds subscribed are to be used
exclusively for this purpose and in absolutely necessary cash expenses in forwarding the common
interests of all concerned. No part of the fund goes to inventor until nett profits are declared, when
he takes one-third.

Row’s Assorted Bitters
CONTAIN
Row’s Dandelion Bitters.
We recommend these BITTERS to be taken
two or three times a day ; a wineglassful for an
adult, smaller quantity for children.
For General Debility, Dyspepsia, Rheumatism,
and Cutaneous Affections.
The action of dandelion, more especially upon
the liver and kidneys, is more reliable for remov-
ing all impure secretions than any other medicinal
plant known.
Persons suffering from Skin diseases will find
these Bitters invaluable.
DIRECTIONS FOR USB.
One wineglass two or three times a day after
meals diluted with same quantity of water. For
young people about half the quantity twice a day.
They Purify the Blood and Liver.
See what a Medical Gentleman says
about them.
Messrs. E. Row and Co.
With thanks for forwarding me a bottle of your
Row’s Dandelion Bitters, and consider them most
excellent, and superior to many others that I have
previously tried. Yours faithfully, HENRY
CHARLES CURTIS, M.R.C.S., England.

Baron Berzilius’-
=“ -Bnchu Bitters.
BARON BERZILIUS’ REPORT.
They are chiefly given in complaints of the Urinary
Organs, such as Gravel, Chronic Catarrh, morbid Irrita-
tion of the Bladder and Urethra, Diseases of the Prostrate
Glands, and Retention or Inconvenience of Urine, from
the loss of tone in the parts concerned in its evacuation.
These Bitters I also recommend in Dyspepsia, in Chrome
Rheumatism and Cutaneous affections. The action of
Buchu on the human frame is more effectual on ail
diseases of the Kidneys and Bladder than any other herbal
plant; and it also assists persons suffering from Skin
Diseases, causing a healthy action of the secretions and
inducing perspiration.
Read what Medical men say about them
BJERKIN, M.D. :—The Bitter is pure, and not like
others in overdoses. It has a remarkable influence on the
liver, promoting the secretions cf Bile, and correcting it,
when deranged, ai d restores healthy evacuations in cases
of habitual costiveners.
D. ECKSTROM, M.D.-BBBB—I find thtae Bitters a
most valuable and wholesome tonic, being pure and
strengthening; a stimulant to the liver, assisting diges-
tion. 1 therefore thus recommend them.
G. B. WOOD, M.D.—lt is the purest of Bitters, and
exerts a peculiar influence over the liver.
Row’s Steane’s Bitters.
QTUDY HEALTH BY TAKING ROW’S
STEANE’S BITTERS.
The great demand throughout the colony for
these pure Bitters shows they are superior to all
others and equalled by none.
Facts Speak Louder than Words.
Read this sworn testimony from a well-known
citizen;—
Statutory Deci aration.
‘I) George Hewett, do hereby solemnly and
sincerely declare as follows
1 hat I feel it a duty I owe to the publi-i to
state that I have been suffering for many years
from weakness of the stomach, so called INDI-
GESIION or DYSPEPSIA, and have been cured
by my taking two or three glasses of ROW’S
STEANE’S BITTERS a day in a little water, and
1 hope others suffering from the same complaint
will be as speedily cured.
“(Signed) G. HEWETT,
“ 215 Pitt-street.
Row’s You’ll Do Bitters.
All who suffer from Chest Complaints, Cold, Coughs,
and general weakness of the Lungs, will gain more ease
and comfort from a wineglass of ROW’S YOU'LL DO
BITTERS than any cough medicine tried before.
Row’s Pepsine Bitters-
All who suffer from Weak Digestion will soon
be cured by these Bitters, taken three times a day
before meals.
Row’s Oriental Bitters.
A Splendid General Tonic, with a tumbler of
water makes a drink equal to any best Champagne.
Row’s Steane’s Wine
Is a safe and sure stimulant for the female sex or
children, for it raises and strengthens depressed
systems without producing a temporary excite-
ment to be followed by greater depression.
Persons suffering from loss of appetite and
eneral depression of spirits cannot do better than
take
ROW’S STEANET WINE.
It cannot harm you, but must do good to all
delicate persons. Young Ladies can take this
when suffering from general debility. It’s only a
pure tonic. Try it.
Teetotallers will find this newly-in vented
TONIC answer all the purposes of a stimulant
without its intoxicating quality. It will satisfy
the cravings of nature and create a desire for food
instead of drink. As an anti febrile is unsur-
passed.
CAUTION—When you call for these ask for
ROW’S, and take no substitute.

It la with heartfelt grati-
tude I write to tell you of the
great benefit my little daugh-
ter Gladys has derived from
‘Benger s Food.' The doctor
and all who saw her thought
wo should never he able to
rear her. We took her to the
hospital, and the authori-
ties recommended * Eenger’s
Food.’ From that time she
began to pick up flesh and
strength."
“If every mother knew of
Its value no other would be

Melodious voice of butcher-boy heard in a long
drawn “Y’ee ep! ” Young lady, with bright red
hair, leans carelessly out of the window. “ What
ver got ’ ” “ Beef, mutton and corned-beef, Ada,
my dear.” “Pooh! ’Arf of it’s goat, yer know
that.” “ You git inside 1 you bin runnin’through
’ell with yer ’at off.”
Dear Bulletin,— ■“ Tom Collins” wishes
to prove “ The Voice from the Bush ” is Gordon’s.
'I'o select parallels between two writers determines
nothing. The Baconians say Shakespeare is
Bacon—for one thing, because each misquotes
Aristotle’s remark with regard to philosophy not
being good for young men. Yet both Bacon and
Shakespeare stole from a third—William Bawd-
win author of “A Mirror for Magistrates” and
„t “ A Treatise on Moral Philosophy.” Literature
abounds in parallels — sometimes deliberate
plagiarisms, sometimes unconscious echoes, some-
times the accidental coincidences which two men
of the same generation so easily fall into when
treating the same subject. Gordon is full, not
only of Swinburne, Shelley and Browning, but
also of Burns, Scott and Tennyson. E.g., from
•‘The Old Leaven” :
Be a Christian for once, not a Pagan Turk,
Nursing wrath, and keeping it warm.
From “ Tam O’Shanter ”
Where sits our sulky, sullen dame,
Gath’ring her brows like gath’ring storm,
Nursing her wrath to keep it warm.
A poet may profit by another poet, or by a
prose writer, provided the raw material be not
shown. The crib quoted above is an offence
against Art. Suggestions are often allowable.
‘ r VVolf and Hound” and “The Sick Stockrider
are fathered by Ohilde Roland ; “ Laudamus ” by
‘ Evelyn Hope; “From the Wreck ” by “How
they brought the Good News,” and so on. But
this is my point : If .Gordon wrote the “Voice
from the Bush,” he plagiarised himself (not un-
usual). If Morris wrote it, he plagiarised Gordon.
Suppose, as in the Shakespeare and Bacon case,
the true writer plagiarised a third, and perhaps
even a fourth—Tennyson and Browning, or both.
E.g., take these lines from “The Miller’s
Daughter ” : —
Yet All my glass : Give me one kiss :
My own sweet Alice, we must die.
There's somewhat in this world amiss
Shall be unriddled by and by.
The italicised lines are coped in “Wearie Way-
farer.” And here (from the same poem) is the
germ of one resemblance between “Stockrider”
and “Voice”: —
Have I not found a happy earth ?
I least should breathe a thought of pain.
Would God renew me from my birth
I’d almost live my life again.
There is also some ground for the contention that
both “Stockrider” and “Voice” were modelled
on “ Childe Roland,” and a keen critic will note
many slight similarities. Nowadays, Australian
•‘poets’’tax Gordon and Morris with crudeness,
and with numerous other faults. Each, however,
was on the right track ; and neither ever mistook
vulgarity or obscenity for wit. Gordon, too,
possesses an individuality recognisable every-
where. He has always something to say ; what
he says is worth hearing ; and he writes to gi ve
pleasure. The bush he found to be a field for
more or less dramatic work, which contains passion,
feeling, imagination, taste and beauty. Modern
writers see only a ground for that fatal facility
which, in their case, may be cal ed Bret Hartean or
Yankee smartness. In the past there lies on -Aus-
tralian poetry the taint of Swinburne. But
poetry it is. The present Australian “bards
put a prose tale into sing-song metres ; and, on
the day of publication, they tramp the streets
with the red cover of The Bulletin dangling
from their pocket. Whether it be drawn fiom an
on a station or a pressman, a B. A. or a
■clergyman, the poetic stream has but one level
now. Baroroft Boake was perhaps an exception,
but he is not with us. —W, L. Ckaig, M db.

RESTORED TO HEALTH
BY THE USE OF
Ayer’s Sarsaparilla
Mrs. M. A. Gumming, of Yarraville,
Victoria, Australia, says:
“About a year ago, I had a severe attack
of Influenza, which left me very weak, with-
out energy, appetite, or interest in life. Ob-
taining little or no relief from doctors, or
from the many remedies recommended to me,
I finally tried Ayer’s Sarsaparilla, and from
that time, I began to gain health and strength.
7^3
/
I continued the treatment until fully recov-
ered, and now have very great pleasure in
telling my friends of the merits of Ayer’s Sar-
saparilla, and the happy results of its use. I
consider it the best blood-purlfler known.”

BLAKE PUMPS.
In addition to the original SINGLE BLAKE PUMP, we also
make two different styles of Duplex Pumps—the “STANDARD oi

Duplex Pumps are constructed with Composition Piston Rods, Stuffing
Boxes, Valve Seats, Valve Bolts and Pump Cylinder Linings. The Water
.Pistons are also made of Composition, and are suitably packed with
Adjustable Fibrous Packing, adapted for Hot or Cold Liquids.
The “ Special,” although not of so high a class as our “ Standard ’
Pattern, are nevertheless well and faithfully made. They are through-
out heavier and stronger than other
makers’ pumps of same class and
selling for same price, and we
guarantee them to give thorough
satisfaction. For contractors’ work,
and where a more expensive pump
might not be justifiable, they are
specially suitable.

pensive twilight, and then keerlessly pro-
ceeded, makin’ no account what we did —
To wipe up with his person casual dust upon the
floor.
Now a square fight never frets me, nor unpleasant-
ness upsets me, but the simple thing that gets
me —now the job is done and gone,
And we’ve come home free and merry from the
peaceful cemetery, leavin’ Cutter there with
Sutter—is that mebbee just a stutter
On the part of Mr. Cutter caused the loss we
deeply mourn.
Some bashful hesitation, just like spellin’ punc-
tooation —might have worked an aggravation
onto Sutter’s mournful mind,
For the witnesses all vary ez to wot was said, and
nary a galoot will toot his horn except the
way he is inclined.
But they all allow that Sutter had begun a kind
of mutter, when uprose Mr. Cutter with a
sickening kind of ease,
And proceeded then to wade in to the subject
then pervadin’ ; “ Is Profanity degradin’?”
in words like unto these :
“ Onlike the previous speaker, Mr. Cutter of
Yreka, he was but a humble seekeit —and not
like him—a cuss ”
It was here that Mr. Sutter softly reached for Mr.
Cutter, when the latter, with a stutter, said :
“ accus-tomed to discuss.”
Then Sutter he rose grimly, and sorter smilin’
dimly, bowed onto the Chairman primly—
(just like Cutter ez could be !)
Drawled “Heguessed he must fall back as—Mr.
Cutter owned the pack as —he just had played
the Jack as ” (here Cutter’s gun went
crack ! as Mr. Sutcer gasped and ended)
“ every man can see !”
But 'William Henry Pryor—just in range of
Sutter’s fire—here evinced a wild desire to do
somebody some barm—
And in the general scrimmage no one thought if
Sutter's “image” was a misplaced punctoo-
ation—like the hole in Pryor’s arm.
Eor we all waltzed in together, never carin’ to
ask whether it was Sutter or was Cutter we
woz tryin’ to abate ;
But we couldn’t help perceivin’, when we took to
inkstand heavin’, that the process was relievin’
to the sharpness of debate.
So we’ve come home free and merry from the
peaceful cemetery, and I make no commentary
on these simple childish games,
Tilings is various and human —and the man ain’t
born of woman who has got enough acumen to
say wot’s another’s aims !

Fred Douglass, ex-slave, the well-known
black orator, died the other day without seeing
the negro free. When, not long ago, he was
nppomted U.S. Minister to Hayti, “the black
republic,” and a man-of-war was ordered to be
placed at his disposal for the voyage, the captain
thereof declined to sit down to table with the
black man although he was a U.S. Minister !

The ever-fragrant society person of Sydney
Sunday Times makes a few learned remarks on
Bad Breath :
You remember how I pointed out the danger of kissing
some time back in the Sunday Times. Dr. Edward
Berdoe now rises in the Westminster Budget to declare
that "kissing, no doubt, is answerable for much throat
mischief, and it is quite as well that the cheek should be
substituted for the mouth, as in France/* That is exactly
what I contended, for I could never imagine how girls
can bring themselves to kiss the lips of the majority of
men. Take a man who imbibes in his club in the after-
noon, or smokes bad cigars or a foul pipe his mouth
must be horrible. And yet when he goes home he
expects a woman to put her pure lips to his, and sicken
herself with his breath I It wouldn’t be so bad, you
know, if he just kissed her on the cheek, for she could
wash off the effect. If a microbe gets into the throat, or
finds a home in the mouth, all the water in the harbor
could not wash it out. I think it is time a number of
ladies made up their minds to resist the custom, and I
would suggest that a club of young women be formed foi
the purpose. Lip-kissing is just as barbarous as the nose-
rubbing of the Maori landers.
Yet the two worst breaths the present writer ever
met belonged to a pair of good men who neither
drank, smoked, swore, chewed tobacco, or other-
wise misconducted themselves. They were part-
ners in an iron-foundry, and belonged to the
heavy-breathing variety of person—they didn’t
breathe through the nose like respectable people,
but blew violently through their open mouths.
They used to get one on each side of their miser-
able clerk and blow on him while giving him
instructions, and after a few years he died of it.
Then another man took his place and was breathed
upon for a year, at the end of which period he
left in search of a purer atmosphere. Tue firm
got into difficulties about this time, and its banker
put his young son in as clerk, so that he might
keep an eye on things. The firm breathed on him
also, with the very best intentions, and he went
away and reported the matter to his father, and
the father called in one day to look at the books,
and the firm sat on each side of him, and breathed
and discoursed on the state of business with such
good effect that he foreclosed a week later. All
of which hasn’t much to do directly with the
question of kissing, but it has an important bear-
ing on the theory that it is only the man who
smokes and drinks who is unfit to be used for
kissing purposes.
Oscar Wilde thinks it a burning shame
that there should be one law for men and another
law for women. “ I think,” he says, that there
should be no law for anybody.”
It is now denied that Mr. Munro Ferguson
is to succeed Lord Kmtore as S. A. Governor. Hi’-
Secretary for id bate has had ‘‘a large number or
applications' for the position from noblemen and
others.”
Two Americans and two Englishmen, who
got up a burlesque insurrection the other day at
Honolulu, have been sentenced to 30 years im-
prisonment apiece. As the little filibustering
state isn’t likely to last for 12 months, this is
probably intended for clumsy humor.
A cleric attending the General Synod at
Nelson (M.L.) called at a shop in. “Sleepy
Hollow” where soft drinks were retailed. He
drank half-a-bpttle of hop tonic, and ordered the
balance to be delivered at his lodgings 1 Next day
he called again, in company with his wife and
demanded why his order had not been fulfilled.
“We are not in the habit of delivering such large
orders !” Whereupon the divine demanded two
glasses, and he and his spouse finished the
beverage.
Mrs. Besant leaves India for England Apri 1
6th. The attack made on her and on the society
in the Westminster Gazette, while she was
lecturing here under the wing of the “most-
travelled,” has so disorganised the faithful in
E igland that all propagandist work is at a stand-
still, and “ the nucleus of a universal brotherhood ”
is still “ in the astral,” in the words of the occult-
lore. Much is hoped for on Mrs. Besant’s return ;
but her intellectual capacity is now so hopelessly
discredited, that for all but incorrigible idiots the
last word is said regarding the mahatraic mystery.
I A man who turned Queen’s evidence in
j the Melb. tobacco-robbery case was finally in-
I formed by Chief Justice Madden that “the Court
I couldn’t negotiate for mercy on any such terms,
I and his treachery aggravated his offence.” Five
1 years’ hard labor proved to be his reward fo
i peaching, although there was a time when it pal J
a criminal to “peach.” In the English case of
Burke and Hare, who murdered all sorts and con
ditions of people for the sake of their corpses,
which were sold to hospital authorities as “grave-
snatchings,” one of the dealers betrayed his
associate to save his own neck. In the language
of the Tussaud Waxworks catalogue, “ this men-
-1 ster of wickedness was let loose upon the world.
Queen Victoria, seemingly, has renounced thedoj-
I trine that one good turn deserves another.

Jessop’s Coat.
[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
Jessop wore a new coat —a gorgeous garment be-
decked with astrakhan, and beautified by moon-
like buttons. It must have cost six pounds.
Lucky, luxurious dog, Jessop !
Very different was the condition of Judson and
Robins. They were two chronically bankrupt
bank-clerks, with a holiday, a “dead bird for
the Anniversary Handicap, and not a copper to
back it with. Standing at a street corner they
discussed the situation and every financial possi-
bility, concluding reluctantly that they had
neither cash nor credit. Suddenly Judson said,
“Look at this blessed Croesus coming along 1
“ Who? ” queried Robins.
“Why, Jessop, with a coat on him like an
angora goat.”
With an air of envy and resentment, Judson
and Robins watched the fine-feathered Jessop till
he entered a lodging-house near by.
“ I suppose we couldn’t tap him again? Robins
murmured reflectively.
“ Tap him I No, indeed 1 If Jessop don t know
us no one does. But, by Jove, I’ve got an inspira-
tion. We’ll borrow his coat.”
“ You’re a genius, Judson, I know,’’ remarked
Robins, “but I don’t see what good that would
be to us on a sweltering day like this.”
“Couldn’t we put it up the spout ? Oouldn t we
get three or four quid on it ? Couldn’t we back
Caravan with the stuff, make a ‘ pony ’ each, and
redeem the coat after the race ? Oouldn t we, eh .
broke out Judson like a dynamited note of inter-
rogation. , , . ,
“We could, we could, assented Robins, hum-
bly ; “ but how’ll we get the coat? Jessop would
know wo had no need of it on a day like this.
“He wears it to show off. Why shouldn’t one
of us? But I’ve got a oat that will jump better
than that.” _ , ,
Having thus sanely delivered himself, Judson a
stock of sanity seemed exhausted, for he began to
act in a way which Robins liked as little as he
understood. First, he wet his hand in the gutter,
then he made for it a sort of mud glove by diving
it into the dust. That done, he deliberately
printed a filthy impression of his paw fair in the
centre of Robins’ shirt-front. Robins was just
about to move round and curse at large, when the
eccentric Judson remarked :
“ Now go and borrow Jessop’s coat to hide your
dirty shirt.” . , ,
“Judson,” said Robins, feelingly, you are
indeed a genius. Let us go together.”
They went, and Jessop laughed very much at
Robins’ shirt-front, and said Judson was a wag.
He was in a fine humor, and when Robins men-
tioned his wish to have a loan of the coat, Jessop
“Certainly, with the greatest of pleasure,” and
in a minute Robins was arrayed in half-a-
hundred weight of coat. _
“ Are you fellows going into town ? said
Jessop. They were in South Yarra.
“ —yes !” said Judson, “we’re going to
walk.” He thought that might choke Jessop off,
it he had a design to accompany them.
“Oh, I’ll walk,” said Jessop.
There was no escape, so Judson and Robins
hyp'critically ejaculated, “ That’s fine.”
Long before they got to town Robins felt the
weight"of Jessop’s coat, and perspired freely. He,
however, consoled himself with the prospect that
they would soon get rid of Jessop, and, soon after,
of his coat.
When they reached the city they all stood,
Judson and Robins expecting that Jessop would
go his way, and so determine theirs. They were,
therefore, greatly perturbed when Jessop re-
marked, “ Where are you fellows going to-day ?”
“Er—er,” began Judson, desperately, “we
were thinking of taking a stroll out to Coburg.’’
That classic and compulsory resort of Victoria’s
criminality is a distance of five miles from Mel-
bourne, and Judson mentioned it with a view to
Jessop’s possible wish to join them. Great was
the horror of the conspirators when Jessop said
“ Well, I’ve got nothing else to do to-day, I’ll
go with you,”
To groan or make any other conventional de-
monstration would have been to betray themselves.
They suffered, and Robins sweated, in silence.
Their only hope was to get it over, shunt Jessop,
pawn the coat, and rush away to Williamstown
in time to back Caravan for the Handicap. They
resigned themselves to Fate and started upon the
walk to which they had been so calamitously com-
mitted. Jessop was in jubilant spirits, and
rallied his friends upon their sudden depression.
• * *
That tramp will live in the memory of Jessop,
Judson, and Robins all their days, and it will be
among their choicest reminiscences of earth when
they meet in “ the great Perhaps.” For the first
couple of miles poor Robins got the worst of it,
with the result that Judson, simply through see-
ing another man in a more unpleasant plight than
himself, gradually recovered his characteristic
cheerfulness, Robins perspired and grew very
bloody-minded under bis affliction. He knew
there was a creek at Coburg, and he commenced
to plot a scheme whereby Jessop might be drowned
in it. Several other murderous methods he dis-
cussed, mentally, while Jessop and Judson made
jokes and laughed. His condition was truly
dreadful, but it was beautifully and almost com-
pletely compensated by Providence.
A thunderstorm gathered. The relentless,
roasting sun became veiled by heavy clouds big
with their terrible triplets—flash, crash and splash.
There was a mighty kick-up, and the rain came
down as if the River Jordan had found a crack in
the sky. Robins revelled in it. Jessop’s coat was
watertight.
Jessop and Judson were dumb and depressed.
Jessop was particularly annoyed. He oast furtive
glances at his coat, and once or twice seemed about
to say something. At last he blurted out :
“Look here, Robins, I don’t see why I should
get wet through while you’re keeping yourself dry
with my coat. You might be gentleman enough
to return it now that you see I have need of it.”
“ That be hanged 1” retorted Robins. “You lent
me the coat, and I want it as much as ever I did,
and a great deal more.”
This delighted Judson, who made remarks calcu-
lated to make the disputants very angry. They
warmed up until Jessop said that Robins was
“ nothing but a low cad.”
This was altogether too much for Robins, who
impulsively took off the coat, flung it to Judson
(who immediately put it on), and violently attacked
Jessop. A fierce fight ensued, in which both
belligerents got wet through, while Judson, cosy
in .Jessop’s coat, looked on, acted referee and im-
mensely enjoyed himself. Finally, Jessop con-
quered, which perhaps was only just.
The elemental strife ceased almost simul-
taneously, and when the sun came out again the
steamy exhalations from the soaked ground made
the heat more oppressive than ever. Judson
wished to return the coat to Rooms. Rooms
couldn’t see it. He was covered with mud as a
consequence of his combat with Jessop, but as
they were in the country he did not mind that.
Nothing would induce him to again wear the in-
fernal coat in such an atmosphere. It looked as
if there would be another fight, when a friend of
Judson’s came along driving a covered wagonette
and offered them a lift to town. This they joy-
fully accepted, and soon were once more in Mel-
bourne. _ .
The necessity to get rid of Jessop was as strong
with Judson and Robins as ever, and Jessop un-
expectedly came to their relief. He said he was
going to have a shave, and asked if they would
come in and wait. They went and watched
Jessop get lathered. As soon as he was thus
secured Judson slipped out. Robins followed.
* * *
At last they were free, and they hurriedly
repaired to a pawnshop. Judson took charge of
the delicate business, and when safe within the
curtained recess he exhibited the coat with the
usual formula. The Hebrew proprietor closely
examined the garment, and then turned and ran
his swivel eye down the stolen-property list, ihen
he called out “ Nebuchadnezzar 1 and a
juvenile Jew came, to whom the ancient one
whispered a mission. , „ ~ _
The unsophisticated Judson and R,obms re-
garded all this as business, and were patient.
At last the pawnbroker asked them Vadt dey
vandted on de goat ? ” „
“ Four pounds is a fair thing, I think I re-
turned Judson. , ,
Thereupon followed the inevitable haggling,
which was harshly interrupted by the entrance of
two policemen, who exchanged a few words with
the Jew and then took the excessively protesting
Judson and Robins in charge for “larceny of the
Chief Justice’s coat.” This was, in two senses, a
bolt from the blue,” and gladly would the
astonished adventurers have made it so in a third
by a bold dash for freedom. But that was put
out of the question by each constable seizing his
man by the collar and running him to the lock-up.
Judson and Robins were grievously pained by
this indignity. They thought of Caravan, ihey
also thought of Jessop, and wondered in what
mysterious fashion his coat was connected with
that of the Chief Justice. This suggested to Jud-
son the idea of sending for Jessop and getting him
to explain. He accordingly detailed to the ser-
geant a statement of how they had borrowed the
coat from Jessop, who had given them permission
to pawn it. The sergeant listened with that
incredulous air which does much to create an
impression of official wisdom in the minds of an
awed public, and, with lightning rapidity, based
a “ theory ” upon the prisoners’ story. He decided
that Jessop was an accomplice in the heinous
crime of stealing the Chief Justice’s coat, and,
having obtained his address from the too-confadmg
Judson, promptly ordered his arrest.
In due course Jessop joined his former com-
panions of the day, who explained that they had
been walking along the street when the policeman
arrested them. In return, Jessop narrated how
he had been struck with the Chief Justice s coat
and had obtained one exactly like it. This J ud-
son and Robins rather resented, and they
reproached Jessop with having indulged his vanity
in a direction which had brought them to such
tr What might have been the fate of the unfortu-
nates is not nice to surmise. What did happen is
painful to relate. It gave the sergeant such a
shock that he had to be pensioned shortly after-
wards, Standing at the watch-house door and
looking along the street he saw being hustled
along by a constable, but vigorously resisting and
protesting, that Holy of Holies —the Chief Justice.
None other.
The sergeant, however, had his duty to perform,
and with every expression of pain he enquired the
charge. . ,
“Larceny of the Chief Justices coat, which
he is at present wearing,” quoth the last man to
join, and the sergeant sank down upon a seat and
begged to be excused.
There was no need for the learned and outraged
dignitary to explain. The sergeant divined all.
The coat had been recovered and restored to its
owner, who upon again wearing it had been run
in by the raw recruit.
It took a great deal to pacify the big gun of the
law, but he finally departed in peace. Shortly
afterwards, Jessop, Judson, and Robins were
released, Jessop keeping possession of his coat;
and in much amazement at the ways of the law
they went home.
• • •
That night Judson and Robins read in the
evening papers how Caravan had been beaten by
a bare head. Then they silently shook hands,
and as one man blessed the frustration of their
plot to hypothecate “ Jessop’s Coak”

[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
I You have preferred to gulp your pleasure as it
flowed,
At one pull; .
You have revelled in your glory as it glowed,
To the full:
So, since you’ve spent in days
What was meant to last for years,
You must leave your pleasant ways
And must walk the Vale of Tears.
You have looked upon the wine when it was red,
Strong and red ;
You have joked and sung until you are as dead,
And instead
Of pleasant sunshine fleeting,
The grey shadows premature
Even now'do give you greeting
To the pangs you must endure.
You toyed with Phryne’s charms when you were
strong,
Without pause :
And you dallied in your love-joys overlong,
So, because
You have frittered in such haste
All your lifelong share of youth,
You must wander through the waste
Of the joyless, loveless Truth.
