SCENE OF THE MACDONALD MASSACRE, SINISTER GLENCOE, SCITLAND
rjXENCOE, signifying “Glen of weeping” in Gaelic, was the scene on 13th
February, 1692,- of a massacre, carried out ostensibly under the orders of
William 111 by Campbell of Glenlyon and his soldiers, who stayed as the
guests of the Macdonalds of Glencoe. The reason for the slaughter was the
alleged failure of the Macdonalds' to take the oath of allegiance to the king
by the end of the year 1691. Every clan took this oath except the
Macdonalds. Maclan, their chief, held out till the last moment, but finally
set out through the snowdrifts to swear loyalty before the magistrates at
Fort William. When he arrived there he discovered that this oath had to
be taken before the sheriff of Inveray, which he reached on January 6th,
took the oath and the papers were sent to Edinburgh, where they arrived
a few days later than the time of grace allowed.
The authorities in Edinburgh—and notably Sir John Dalrymple, Secretary
of State—were anxious to stamp out the Macdonalds, and consequently when
the register was passed to the Privy Council the name of Macdonald
of Glencoe was omitted, thus leaving the clan formally liable to punishment.
In early February, 1692, a detachment of 128 men of the Earl of
Argyle’s regiment, all Campbells and hereditary enemies of the Macdonalds,
set out from the garrison at Inverlochy under the command of Campbell
of Glenlyon. They marched into the Glen, where they expressed friendship
for their victims and were received with true Highland hospitality. The
signal to begin the massacre was given at five o’clock on the dark winter
morning of 13th February. In every little hut throughout the Glen the same
treachery occurred as guest murdered host and his family. When at length the
dawn came, thirty-eight Macdonalds had been murdered and the Campbells
marched out of the Glen driving before them two hundred horses, nine
hundred cattle and many sheep and goats. There had been for centuries
many savage blood-feuds in the Highlands, but none were more inhuman
than that of Glencoe, commemorated by a monument which stands near the
green salmon pool of the River Coe seen in the above picture.

AT SEA WITH McLAREN.
Jack McLaren’s My First Voyage
(Quality Press) is something more than a
book; it is an experience.
The cook of the sailing-ship on which
the autobiographical story is set, having
quarrelled with the captain, has been im-
prisoned in the ship’s lazarette. McLaren,
who has sailed as cabin-boy and, pro-
moted to cook, has concocted a terrible
curry, also falls out with the captain —
to the extent of knocking him down —
and joins the cook in his dungeon, the
pair of them handcuffed and chained to
stanchions. The cook welcomes his com-
pany ; —
He told me that he had never been so
glad of anything as he was of my presence,
for the loneliness had been getting on his
nerves a bit, as he put it, especially at night,
when, because of the chain, sleep was any-
thing but easy. He told me that during
those dark and lonely hours he tried to
cheer himself up by singing every song he
knew or partly knew, and when he couldn’t
recall the whole of a verse he made up
words for himself. He told me it astonished
him how good were some of those words
of his —“Real first-class stuff, miles better
than the proper words.”
When he had exhausted the songs he
went through all the prayers he knew, and
then on „to poems and scraps of poems,
among them being a bit of “Casabianca,”
a verse or two of Longfellow’s “Psalm of
Life,” the whole of “The Miner’s Dream
of Home” and some verses of a poem whose
name he could not remember, but which
was concerned most sentimentally with a
lass, her lover, and moonlight, and brought
to him vivid recollections of a lass that he
himself had loved in moonlight long ago.
The cook, “the contents of whose
mind,” as McLaren says, have thus art-
lessly been revealed, is an endearing char-
acter. He has, so he later confides, three
great ambitions —to become an actor, or
to win a prize with a model in confec-
tionery of the Houses of Parliament, or
to open a boardinghouse in some busy
dockside district—and at least one of
these dreams comes true, for McLaren
discovers him, many years later, as the
proprietor of a seaside boardinghouse: —
The good trade he did was among
holidaymakers and tourists, and his experi-
ence of seagoing had developed so that
he wore a peaked cap and called himself
Cap’n, and expected other people to call
him Cap’n too, and always was ready with
stories of wild nights at sea when only by
the exercise of grand seamanship did he
bring his good ship safely through the
storm. Watching him then, it struck me
that his belief in his talent as an actor had
been considerably well-grounded.
As McLaren gets to know the little
cook in the lazarette, his hopes, his
dreams, his aspiring soul, so does the
reader: the character is drawn to the
life. And the whole experience of that
imprisonment is as vivid as the element
of comedy supplied by the cook. It is a
picture of the human mind alone in the
universe, for when, in the later part of
the night, a lamp in a cabin above, which
throws a little light through a grating,
is put out, McLaren, listening to the
sound of the sea below and around him,
cannot see his companion or even his own
hand: —
Never, indeed, had I been in a darkness
so complete. It seemed astonishing that
at no spot was the least vestige of light.
The eyes sought for some alleviation, how-
ever small, of that darkness, and continued
to seek. It was as though they couldn’t
believe it. It was a darkness that seemed
to be thick and close about me; not only
a darkness that could be felt, but a dark-
ness that seemed to feel me. Often I
could have sworn I felt it actually pressing
on my face. It gave me a feeling of suf-
focation. I wanted to push it back, keep
it away from my mouth and nose. I came
to welcome the first sign of returning day
through the grating much as a really suf-
focating man would have welcomed air.
I knew now acutely how my companion
felt when he had been driven to going
through his poor little songs and poems.
My special fear, however, during that dark-
ness, was that I had gone blind. I had
no means of telling that I hadn’t gone blind.
No matter how close I put my hand to my
face I couldn’t see it. As the dark hours
went on I would fear that the time was
later than I thought—fear that daylight
had come and I could not 'see it.
McLaren is not digging up his youth
here for the purpose of sympathising
with the shade of himself at the age of
17 ; on the contrary, his theme is the con-
quest of fear. But the picture of isola-
tion, claustrophobia and that unreasoning
terror which made him, when his com-
panion would reassure him, suspect that
“maybe he saw I was sightless and out
of pity was keeping the truth from me”
is memorable indeed. It has the night-
marish conviction of Koestler’s Darkness
at Noon.
But My First Voyage is not all dark-
ness and nightmare. The imprisonment
is, if one may use the term, the highlight,
but even that episode changes to the
most delightful comedy when McLaren
finds that he can slip his hand out of
his handcuffs and he and the cook, who
have been fed on weevilly cracker-hash,
weak gruel and washy coffee, raid the
ship’s stores that are stowed with them
in the lazarette: —
So it was that in due course, there on
the floor of our rolling, noise-filled prison,
one of us still chained to his stanchion,
and the other with a loose handcuff dangling
from one wrist, we two had one of the
meals of our lives. A one-pound tin of
roast beef we had; a tin of asparagus,
a bottle of pickles, some herrings in tomato-
sauce, a plum-pudding and biscuits —not
hard ship’s biscuits, of which it was said
no man could eat one right through with-
out a drink, so dry were they, but proper
biscuits, crisp, and with sugar in them and
on them.
As a whole the book bears a strong
resemblance to Conrad’s masterpiece. The
Nigger of the Narcissus. First published
in 1933 under the title Blood on the Deck
and revised for this second edition; it is
the story of a voyage in a sailing-ship
from Australia to South Africa. Inevit-
ably McLaren’s general pattern is much
the same as Conrad’s, and the incidents
that take place during the voyage, if
different in detail, are alike in kind —feats
of skill and strength and courage in
storms, and the quarrels that spring from
too-close companionship, from exaspe-
rated nerves and outworn patience.
McLaren’s narrative may be read as
a novel as well as autobiography, and,
though his central theme of the feud
between a second-mate “with a profound
instinct for battery” and a huge Finnish
sailor nicknamed Sails is different from
Conrad’s drama of the sick or malinger-
ing njgger, there is a coincidence in the
fact that McLaren’s Sails could have been
drawn from the same model as Conrad’s
giant Wamibo.
It is unlikely, however, that McLaren
owes any direct debt to Conrad. One
voyage in a sailing-ship, no doubt, was
very much like another —and just as
fascinating—and more than one giant
Finn sailed the seven seas. And if Mc-
Laren’s book is rather like Conrad’s, that
may be taken as a high compliment to
the Australian writer: for, at some little
distance —the drama is less intense, the
prose lacks Conrad’s full richness — My
First Voyage could take an honorable
place on the same shelf as The Nigger;
or, as the publishers suggest, it might be
compared with Dana’s Two Years Be-
fore the Mast.
It is a swift, clean-moving, compact
story, capably and humorously written,
rising to peaks of drama not only in the
imprisonment scenes, but memorably and
movingly again when, on a night of storm
after the men have been aloft, there is a
roll-call and one man fails to answer.
Above all, the book is convincingly and
compellingly authentic. The author sails
his first voyage again in a rich distillation
of memory, and, so faithful are the details,
so clear the pictures, so lifelike the
characters, and so exciting is the
adventure, the reader goes sailing with
him. Here, as in My Crowded Solitude,
Jack McLaren has written a book that
will last.
More on the Murray.
Professor Macdonald Holmes’s Murray
Valley (R.P. 12/5/’4B) is an admirable
book in itself, but no Murray man could
read it without wanting to add a supple-
ment: a chapter, for instance, on the
Chaffeys.
As for the real romance of the Murray,
Professor Holmes hardly allowed him-
self space to do it justice. He doesn’t
give the picture of the River and the River
people in the days before motor-cars,
telephones, radio, ice, railways and Jack
De Garis; and you can’t separate the
River, or the treatment of the River,
from the stamp those early years—a good
half-century —laid on it, any more than
you can free the run of Sydney’s streets
from the character put on them by
Phillip’s bullock-carts.
Irrigation is all right; Australia cannot
afford to let the Murray water run to
sea, unused. But irrigation also makes
fanatics, especially of Victorians ; I being,
I need not say perhaps, a South Aus-
tralian. The Victorians made up their
minds they had got a nice little cabbage-
patch, and by heck they were going to
water it; if any galoot wanted to main-
tain that the River was a traffic-highway,
too, well, let them fight.
That was after Cadell and Randell had
opened the Murray to steamer-trade, and
a great blessing it was to the Murray
and Darling graziers, whose only other
transport was per bullocky to Sydney or
Melbourne. And not the early graziers
only. When the Victorian gold-diggings
broke out, the Victorian Government pro-
hibited the export of “black sand” (tin
ore) except from Melbourne and Portland,
though bullock-cart freights were up to
£7O and £9O a ton; while from Echuca
it could go by Cadell’s steamers for an in-
significant charge to the Murray mouth.
Cadell’s freights, too, knocked silly the
Melbourne flour and spirits trade to the
diggings. Governor Mac Donnell, of S.A.,
went up to the diggings with Cadell and
was reported as addressing the miners in
these words:
I have frequently witnessed [in Mount
Gambier district] long lines of drays laden
with tobacco and spirits and other dutiable
articles crossing the Victorian frontier
{frontier, please observe]; but I never
thought of putting a Customs-house officer
on the frontier to stop the trade—[cheers]
—and compel the parties engaged in it
to carry it on through a more expensive
and less suitable channel. I never dreamt
of compelling men to turn in a south-
easterly direction for hundreds of miles
when their interest led them in a northerly
direction. »[The northern Victarians cheered
to the echo this reference to the black-
sand exports]. This is the spirit in which
I would like to see your [Government’s]
commercial policy guided and conducted,
more particularly since the peculiar posi-
tion of a large portion of your population
and your geographical relations invite such
forbearance towards your neighbors.
Then the row really started. In order
to cripple the river trade, the Victorian
Government had imposed tonnage dues
and licence fees on trading steamers —that
was what Mac Donnell was talking about
—and even special taxes on passengers
passing the Victorian Murray “frontier.”
Mac Donnell touched off an explosion. In
a formal note a Victorian Minister
accused S.A. of “retracting a pledge” on
customs duties and S.A. promptly
demanded that Victoria disown the note,
as a result of, which the offending Minis-
ter “returned to England.”
Right up till Federation South Aus-
tralian Murray trading steamers would
discharge at the Victorian border all their
goods into store, pass to the Victorian
side, and then' take on from another depot
Victorian-purchased goods, rather than
pay-the Victorian Customs dues.
There was, too, an old animosity
against the lower River settlements as the
" sanctuaries of gold-robbers and other
fugitives making down-river, as they
generally did, from Victorian justice. In
quite recent years old-timers, getting some
new “hunch,” would fossick again in the
Spring Cart' Gully and Chowilla areas
for gold alleged planted by thieves levant-
ing from the Victorian fields. The
smuggling traffic in defiance of the Vic-
torian Customs was extensive ; it was not
only very profitable, but also “stirred the
possum” in men who regarded the Vic-
torian laws as a challenge to free enter-
prise.
Federation cured that, but it did not
cure the dispute between S.A. and Vic-
toria over use of the River. Thus came
the 1915 agreement and the locking of
the Murray to preserve both navigation
and irrigation.
Certainly the miserable apology of a
mouth of the .River handicapped S.A.’s
early stand ; and then later Adelaide and
Port Adelaide interests made common
cause with Melbourne to prevent any
development of a Murray-mouth port. Old
Admiral Creswell, Australia’s first Naval
Board head, maintained till his last day
that a river seaport could be made along
the Coorong at Robe.
The idea the ■ old-timers of the River
had, and it is still valid and worthy, is
that the River waters are for something
more than irrigation ; that the River as
a developed highway will produce indus-
tries of its own that do not depend on
Government subsidy and foreign markets,
and will stimulate closer-settlement
founded on something more than fruit-
growing. That broader conception of it
will infallibly return as population in
the valley grows. The river steamers are
already coming back, with the new tourist
traffic.
If only the planners would let the
“region” develop in its # own way! They
have already necklaced the Murray about
with railways in order to kill it as a water-
way. Now Professor Holmes wants to
necklace it about with six new State boun-
daries for scientific “regional control.”
A new River State? Yes, that would
be something. But six of them! And
Sydney and Melbourne scrapping for
control of them! Professor Holmes is
too optimistic in his faith that dominating
Big-City interests will be induced to make
any concession whatever to local self-
development of the Murray Valley. He
cannot advance a step from his plan for
any such development without running
right up against the barrier on either side
of which the old-time conflict formed its
lines.
Professor Holmes seems not quite to
have the hang of the socialistic village
settlements’ failure on the lower River in
the late ’nineties. They were not “Com-
munist” in the modern interpretation of
the word ; and the “snake in the Eden,”
as Michael Davitt recognised when he
visited them, was that no liquor was
allowed in them and no wages, either. As
soon as these Utopian gardeners appreci-
ated that not far off on the same River
were to be had liquor and work for
wages, the rot set in.
Nor is the Professor correct in deduc-
ing that the community hotels of the
River developed from that community-
settlement scheme. For many years the
first and only Community Hotel was at
Renmark, and it came about there —after
the proposal had been rejected in Mil-
dura—from the determination of the free
settlers in that place to end the sly-grog
traffic by applying for a licence to be
controlled by a Trust. (The Chaffey
Brothers’ settlements forbade any liquor
trade within their limits.) It was many
years before the Renmark example was
imitated at Berri, and only lately have
others followed. The credit not only for
the idea but for the resolution which
rallied fainter hearts on his committee
(when the difficulties of winning Parlia-
ment to the scheme began) is due to one
man, a journalist, Christopher James
Ashwell, who came to Renmark from
New Zealand via Mildura, and was editor
of the first printed (earlier roneoed)
Renmark “Pioneer.”
.Professor Holmes and his disciples will
have some fun when they come to locking
the Darling, and to old-timers along that
river it would be easier to sell the Town
Hall clock than to sell that scheme.
Modern Menindee vegetable-growers may
think it a grand idea; lots pf newchums
have thought so in the past. Or do the
scientists mean to arrange that the Dar-
ling shall never come down again as it did
in the old days? What is the Anabranch
but the scar of the alternative route by
which the Darling once decided to run,
ahd may run again?
There Was “regional development” if
you like!

THE OLD FIELD.
What will he do with his old field,
the old burnt acres under the blue sky—
what will he do, this old man
in the old white hat with his thumbs
wedged
thoughtfully into his sagging waistband ?
“What shall I do with this now?”
Someone lit a match by the old field
when the leaves of yellow maize were
dry.
This match enlarged as only a match can,
spread on the field, yellow and black-
edged,
a hungry butterfly that the old man’s hand
could not frighten and smash low.
“Shall I plough in and fallow the old field
with hate ? Shall I damn it and let it lie ?
Shall I eat flies and use my hat for a
fan ?”
The old man saw once more how the fire
raged
with calm greed across his bit o’ land,
enough to keep him and the old wife and
a cow.
The black teeth of the corn in the old
field
snapped at the frozen air. Corn hates to
die
N.S.W.
Before its time, but this time the flames
ran
down the slope the quarry, never
assuaged.
“Whoever lit that match wouldn't under-
stand,”
the old man said as the sweat tickled his
brow.
The old wife hung on the gate of the old
field
with sagging arms and sunset in her eye.
She watched him fill her painted watering-
can
from the dry tank, empty and smoke-
smudged,
and scatter a dreamed water, his face
grand,
his eyes telling the black old stubs to
grow.
“The cow wants milking,” she told the old
field.
“The man wants feeding again and so
do I.
The field wants ploughing again before
the rain.”
The old man swung the can , and the sun
dislodged
a shower of ruddy seed for him to sow.

(1) Has Mt. Wilhelm, New Guinea,
ever been climbed, and by whom ? (2)
Height of mountain ?
(1) Mt. Wilhelm (original German
name), now known as Mt. Williarh
or Yendere (native name), so far as
is known, was first successfully scaled
by Leigh Grant Vial on August 15,
1938, when he was a patrol-officer of
the New Guinea Administration. He
was bom in Camberwell (Vic.) in
1909; attended Wesley College, repre-
sented Melbourne University at ski-ing
against Sydney; reached rank of F / Lt.
in the R.A.A.F* and was awarded

What is Australia’s national debt
and its rate of increase? (2) Does it
ever decrease? (3) Can it go on
increasing indefinitely? (4) What
means could be used to keep it within
safe limits if further wars caused fast
increases ?
(1) At March 31, 1948, it was
£2,778,175,411. The rate of increase
in the national debt depends upon the
requirements of Governments and the
operations of the National Debt Sink-
ing Fund. These vary from year to
year. During the war, of course, the
rate of increase was substantial. (2)
Yes. Between June 30, 1947, and
March 31, 1948, it decreased by
£11,051,585. (3) It is subject to re-
demption by the operation of the
National Debt Sinking Fund, which
is designed to extinguish debt in
approximately 53 years from the date
such debt was created. Since the
Sinking Fund was created, redemp-
tion of the national debt has been
effected to the extent of £260,748,731.
(4) It is impossible to foretell what
effect further wars would have on
the national debt. Much would de-
pend upon the methods of finance
adopted to meet the costs of any such
wars.

In N.S.W. what metals must be
used in containers or wrappings for
food and toilet preparations ?
The N.S.W. Pure Food Act pro-
hibits the use of containers or wrap-
pings for food if they contain lead,
zinc or other dangerous substance
which may come into contact with
such food. The usual container or
wrapping is made of tin foil or
aluminium foil. There is no pro-
hibition of the use of lead or other
containers for preparations such as
shaving-cream or toilet preparations,
as danger only arises from actual in-
gestion of the substance.

How many times was Dave Smith
heavyweight champion of Australia ?
Did Smith ever meet Bill Lang or Bill
Squires? What is Smith’s age?
Dave Smith won the Australasian
amateur heavyweight championship in
1908, then the professional heavy-
weight title in 1913, and again in
1917. Smith beat Bill Lang on points,
20 rounds, for the Australian cham-
pionship in 1913, and knocked out
Bill Squires, 10th round, in 1916.
Smith (born Dunedin, N.Z., on May
10, 1886) was 59 when he died at
Mosman on May 29, 1945.

UNCABLED
ADDITIONS
NEXT U.S. PRESIDENT.
“Every week it becomes more
likely that the next President of
the United States will be Senator
Vandenberg.”
Thus London “Times’s”
Washington correspondent re-
cently began a column report
on the Presidential campaign ; a
prophecy that few responsible
observers in the U.S. would be
prepared to make so confidently,
though most of them would
probably as soon have their
money on that tip as on any
other.
On one thing the great bulk
of them are agreed: that who
is to be next President will not
be decided next November but
next week —at the Republican
party’s national convention,
which gets going at Philadelphia
on June 21. That is, they don’t,
at this stage, give Mr. Truman
the bolter’s chance, though con-
sidering him certain to get the
Democratic nomination.
Not much is heard here of
possible alternatives to Mr.
Truman, but David Lawrence,
in N. Y. “Sun,” has named two:
“There is no gainsaying the fact
that Mr. Truman is by no means
the strongest candidate the
Democratic party could name.
Chief Justice Vinson would
easily win the contest this year
if given the party nomination.
So would Senator Harry Byrd of
Virginia.”
Lawrence has also touched on
what could well be Mr. Truman’s
fatal weakness as a candidate —
flhat he “has failed to perceive
that the United States is today
Aon-radical.” Says Lawrence:
“A majority of the voters leans
away from fake liberalism and
radicalism, and Mr. Truman has
completely misjudged the temper
of the country by aligning him-
self with the labor-union bosses
and other radicals. The Congress
today reflects the popular will
expressed in November, 1946, not
only through the Republican
majority but the substantial
number of Democrats who voted
for the Taft-Hartley [labor-
control] law. Yet Mr. Truman
clings desperately to the foolish
political strategy which ties his
kite to the C. 1.0. stars. Mr.
Truman might have been a
popular figure and might have
been regarded as a sure winner
if he had not chosen to cast his
lot with the radicals.”
Dismissing Truman —as most
of them do, with enthusiasm -
whoever is the Republican choice
becomes next President. The
chief Republicans in the run-
ning are Vandenberg, Stassen,
Taft, Dewey, Warren and Mar-
tin. From here, on a sampling
of a vast amount of comment
and report, it seems that Van-
denberg and Dewey would
make an exceptionally powerful
Republican team.
The campaign tactics of the
various prospects provide re-
markable contrasts. Apart from
the comparative unobtrusiveness
(by American Presidential-elec-
tion standards, anyway) of War-
ren and Martin, nothing could be
quieter than Vandenberg’s stand
throughout. He has—as already
made an “Uncabled Addition”
—positively not sought the
honor, and N. Y. “Times’s”
chief Washington correspondent,
Arthur Krock, quite recently
quoted intimates of Vandenberg
as expecting he would, even now,
decline. On the other hand,
Stassen was actually the first in
the field, having announced
his candidacy in December,
1946, and been actively cam-
paigning ever since. As to this,
applying differently to each of
them, there is the strong Presi-
dential tradition that “the office
seeks the man.”
Vandenberg has one consider-
able disqualification, which goes
also for Truman and was prob-
ably fatal to MacArthur —age.
This has been touched on by,
among many others, Walter
Lippmann in N. Y. “Herald
Tribune”; “There is no doubt
that J/andenberg is now the man
on whom the active candidates
could most readily come to-
gether. Of no other man can it
be said that there are so many
Republicans who trust him, so
few who are deeply opposed to
him. His choice would, how-
ever, present a special problem
which, considering what is at
stake in the next four years,
needs to be faced calmly and
frankly. Senator Vandenberg
would be nearly 65 when he was
inaugurated, and although his
health is good, it is not so perfect
but that it has to be taken into
account.”
Vandenberg, however, is held
to have been helped greatly by
his comparatively non-active
tactics—not only because of the
tradition referred to, that “the
office seeks the man,” but be-
cause the active campaigners are
reckoned to have been fatally
damaging one another. This
has been in the Nebraska, Ohio,
Oregon and other “primaries”
(as already explained here, these
primary elections are concerned
with appointing the delegates
who will now shortly select the
Republican-p arty Presidential
candidate and his Vice-Presi-
dential team-mate). For ex-
ample, in Ohio (as seen by the
London “Times” correspondent)
Stassen did much to ruin Taft’s
chances by securing a number
of delegates. The result of this
was that “Even the party leaders,
who would prefer Senator Taft
to all the other possibilities, now
admit regretfully that he lacks
political sex appeal and realise
that they must choose someone
who has either more chance of
arousing popular enthusiasm, or,
at worst, has not yet demon-
strated that he arouses only
apathy.”
On the other hand, Stassen, by
having thus invaded Taft’s home
State, was also considered to
have greatly damaged his own
chances: “This is a matter of
political manners which the code
of the party old school tie does
not allow. His enemies can now
point out with justification to
wavering delegates at the con-
vention that with Mr. Stassen in
the White House there would be
a deadlock between the executive
and the legislature. Senator
Taft would still be the leader of
the Senate, and he would hardly
be human if he did not make the
new President’s life a nightmare.
Mr. Stassen may in Ohio have
won nine delegates, but he lost
the nomination.”
The other most active Repub-
lican contender, Dewey, has
certainly tried hard enough.
According to a N. Y. “Times'’
report, Dewey “offended a lot
of people” at a rally in Wyoming
last year “by refusing to don
chaps and a cowboy hat.” It’s
wonderful what goes (and what
counts) in Presidential campaign-
ing ; kissing babies is nothing to
it. As N. Y. “Times” has further
reported on the now-wiser
Dewey: “At Coos Bay he let the
local pirates draw blood from
his arm, with which he signed his
passport to the city. At Grant’s
Pass he ate-raw beef with the
Oregon cavemen.”
Dewey is under one very
heavy handicap. He has
already had one chance for the
Presidency, and if there’s one
thing Americans do not fancy
it’s a loser.
On one thing practically all
are agreed at this moment —that
the contest due for decision
in a smoke-filled room in Phila-
delphia next week is wide open,
to the extent that Warren and
Martin are not looked on as the
outsiders they might seem from
here. It’s anybody’s race.
To U.N.O.’s Credit.
While U.N.O.’s record of
failure in matters political could
not be worse —unless they let
Dr. Evatt do another partition-
ing job—a N. Y. “Herald
Tribune” writer, Peter Kihss,
rightly points out that in other,
specialised, fields U.N.O. is do-
ing some fine work; as, of
course, the League of Nations
also did.
For example, Dr. Brock
Chisholm, of U.N.O.’s World
Health Organisation, lately
claimed that that body worked
up international co-operation
which first confined and then
halted the Egyptian cholera
epidemic, and more recently has
helped check a similar outbjeak
in Syria. Dr. Chisholm reported
it had built defences against a
possible influenza pandemic
such as struck the world after
the 1914-18 war —a system of
rapid notification, collection of
pathological specimens, central
laboratories to identify types,
then arrangements to move in
with vaccines.
Also, it has joined the Inter-
national Children’s Emergency
Fund to fight tuberculosis, which
has sapped the war-devastated
nations. The two organisations
are in process of examining
50,000,000 European youngsters
and vaccinating 15,000,000 of
them against that white plague
—the largest single mass-im-
munisation programme ever
undertaken. The work is being
extended now to China and
India. '
Again, the International
Refugee Organisation has kept
finding homes for displaced per-
sons —200,000 war victims re-
settled or repatriated since last
July 1 ; 900,000 still to go. The
children’s fund has fed 4,000,000
children and nursing mothers in
a dozen European nations, and
is starting in China. The U.N.O.
Appeal for Children has
gathered individuals’ contribu-
tions for the fund in some 50
countries —what Kihss describes
as*“a vote of confidence in U.N.
which saw little Iceland’s
127,000 people, for instance, con-
tribute an average $3 apiece,
plus five tons of clothing.”
These are merely typical
examples of what is being
achieved in a dozen fields, very
much to the credit of U.N.O.
“Iron Curtain” Film.
Australian Communist and
Communist-front reaction to the
20th Century Fox film “The Iron
Curtain” could be forecast now
with absolute certainty.
It will follow the lead of the
squealing fraternity in America,
where, as a N. Y. “World-
Telegram” staff writer puts it,
“the first to scream ‘suppres-
sion!’ when their own activities
are brought to light,” the Corns
have launched a campaign to
have the movie suppressed.
The' picture tells the story of
Igor Gouzenko, young cipher
clerk for the Russian Embassy
in Ottawa, who broke with Com-
munism three years ago and fled
with a sheaf of incriminating
documents. It is based on the
report of the Canadian Royal
Commission.
The yelp, of course, is that it’s
“war propaganda.” No doubt
Australian Corns and fellow-
travellers are practising already.
Recognising Israel.
On one of the sudden, not to
say hilarious, U.S. Palestine
twists, London “Times’s” Wash-
ington correspondent drily com-
mented : “It seems probable that
Mr. Truman the [Presidential]
candidate has once more taken
precedence over Mr. Truman the
President of the United States.”
N. Y. “Daily News” columnist
John O’Donnell declares that,
abandoning partition’s effects on
his candidacy for re-election
having later become ominously
obvious, Mr. Truman moved so
quickly on “recognising” Israel
that he took even the Jewish
leaders of that new State by
surprise.
The report quoted by
O’Donnell was that “White
House Assistant Clark Clifford
phoned Tel Aviv headquarters
from the White House and broke
the surprising news that if a
formal request for recognition
could be made at once, it would
be granted instanter, and it
was.”
On which O’Donnell com-
ments in baseball terms: “No
tipping-off the elaborate State
Department set-up handling the
Near East problem, no consulta-
tion with defence experts study-
ing the scene, no consultation
with U.S. representatives at
U.N., or U.S'. allies. Harry
Truman just stepped in and
pitched his fast ball —taking no
chances of being asked by his
own diplomatic experts to warm
up before he stepped into an
internationally dangerous box
to face some long-distance
sluggers.”
“Cold-War” Victory.
Reviewing progress in the
“cold war” to date, George E.
Sokolsky, N. Y. “Sun’s” very
sound writer on the international
drama or vaudeville, sees it as
“now obvious that Soviet Russia
has lost.”
Sokolsk,y, who himself hailed
fiom thereabouts originally,
basSs that finding on what have
been Russia’s objectives in the
“cold war”:
(1) To consolidate Russia’s
control of European countries
east of the Elbe; (2) to weaken
the Anglo-American position on
the continent of Europe; (3)
to lay the foundations for estab-
lishing Communist States in
Western Europe ; (4) to isolate
the United States diplomatically
while impoverishing the Western
European countries economi-
cally ; (5) to maintain disturb-
ances throughout Asia, from the
Mediterranean to the Pacific;
(6) to isolate Chiang Kai-shek
and to drive the Americans out
of Korea; (7) to eliminate
“majority rule” in international
councils, particularly wherever
it may appear in U.N., and, fail-
ing that, to kill off U.N., which
the Russians regard as a bloc of
Western nations anyhow; (8)
so to increase the cost to the
American taxpayer that he
would (a) refuse to support his
Government’s policy ; ( b) that a
neo-isolationism would develop
in the United States which would
mean the withdrawal of the
United States from Europe and
Asia, leaving both areas to
Soviet Russia.
There has, the writer points
out, been Soviet failure “in every
phase of this policy except the
consolidation of Soviet control
east of the Elbe.”
On the other hand: “The
relations between Great Britain
and the United States have never
been on a friendlier basis nor
more co-operative nor closer to
the Western countries of Europe.
Not even during the actual war
have the American people
accepted the partnership with
Great Britain more willingly.
“In Western Europe Com-
munism is receding very
actively receding. Ditto for
Central and South America.
“The United States is not iso-
lated diplomatically but, fumb-
lingly, it is true, continues to
lead the Western World.
is no longer
economically impoverished but
has received a goodly share of
dollar credits.
“While disturbances continue
in Palestine, no important group
of Arabs or Zionists is pro-
Russian, and Iran is, for the
moment, safe.
“Whereas Chiang Kai-shek is
in difficulties, he has survived
the onsfaught of the Communist
armies and the machinations of
the fellow-travellers. And the
Stilwell - Marshall policy for
China, never correct, is now fully
rejected.” (The China-policy re-
ferred to included Chiang Kai-
shek’s bringing his enemies, the
Chinese Communists, into his
Government.)
As well, though “no American
enjoys the cost of all the U.S.
activities,” the nation has stood
behind all the Army, Navy and
Air Force expansions ; “in fact,
Congress has gone further than
the President in support of the
armed forces.” And, instead of
any revival of isolationism, “the
country is united in support” of
a non-party foreign policy (de-
finitely aimed at stopping
Russia), which “will not be
affected even slightly by the
Presidential election.”
What, in Sokolsky’s view,
Russia has been about in repre-
senting the U.S. as asking for
peace talks has been trying itself
to “recede from an iintenable
position without losing ‘face’.”

thau’s revenge-feeling towards Ger-
many, etc. Yet another example,

as well be said publicly, that U.S.
Secretary of State Marshall is deeply
influenced in his views on China by a
sharp personal distaste for General-
issimo Chiang Kai-shek. This distaste
is the no doubt subconscious root of
Marshall’s wholly negative approach
to the China problem.”

Beats Hitler Hollow. — N. Y.
“Times” measures them: “Stalin’s
acquisitions already amount to more
than four times those of Hitler prior
to the war.”

Hirohito Adored. — A while back
Hirohito was put on tour as a
“democratic monarch”; part of the
programme for converting the Japs.
Total result, as recorded by “United
States News and World Report”:
“The idea is boomeranging. A
public sampling shows that the Em-
peror is more adored by the Japanese
now than before the war.”

The King’s "Salary.” — Quoting
British Information Services, N. Y.
“Sun” has pointed out that “the in-
come of the Royal family constitutes
no burden on the British people”:
“If the annual cost of the Royal
residences and salaries is balanced
against the annual from Royal proper-
ties voluntarily surrendered to the
Exchequer the nation makes a profit
of £703,470 a year. This assumes
that the King draws his full income
of £110,000 a year, which he never
does. During 1942 and 1943, for
example, the King drew no salary
at all.”

Fine Rationing.— They cut the meat
mighty thin in Britain these days;
10d.-worth per week (or one chop),
and it’s no use going to restaurants
to fill up, because they (as Charles
Graves mentions in a “Saturday Even-
ing Post” article) “are allowed to
spend only one penny per pre-war
customer for meat.”

U.S. Industry Looks Ahead. —For
the third year in succession, reports
N. Y. “Journal of Commerce,” Ameri-
can industry is spending more on new
plant and equipment than ever before,
even with due allowance for the higher
price level. Upwards of $16,000,000,000
will be expended for new plant and
equipment this year. It means about
8 per cent, of the whole national out-
put of goods and services going into
producers’ durable equipment, a higher
percentage than in any past year.

Little Country, Big Aid. —Greece
has already received more foreign aid
a head of population than any other
country. J. Bull took over from
U.N.R.R.A., and when he could give
no more Uncle Sam stepped in. Lon-
don “Times” reckons the total aid
so far at $1,000,000,000, without
which “the Greek State would have
foundered months ago.”

Russia’s Army. — According to
former Moscow correspondent of
N. Y. “Times” Drew Middleton, the
Soviet Army (“the adjective ‘Red’
has been abandoned”) is at present
the most formidable in the world
from the point of view of manpower,
tanks and guns, with one important
qualification: “In 1948 it is probably
the finest army in the world for the
warfare of 1945.” Middleton quoted
evidence of a strong belief among
Soviet leaders that what was good
enough for 1945, or even earlier, will
be feood enough for 19 —.

"Safe” Jobs for Coins. —Thus Mr.
Wallace’s U.S. Presidential team-
mate, Senator Taylor: “While
Communists should not be placed in
Government jobs which give them
access to official secrets, there are
many public jobs in which they would
be useful.” Chicago “Tribune’s” com-
ment : “Sen. Taylor recognises, in dis-
qualifying Communists for jobs hav-
ing access to confidential information,
that Communists are spies. In plead-
ing that they be given ‘safe’ Govern-
ment jobs, he would have the public
forget that whether a Communist has
any opportunity to conduct espion-
age, he is always an agent of a
foreign Government and that he will
use any position he can get to serve
his alien masters to the detriment of
the country that trusts him*”-

"NO-BALL" IN MALAYA.
Mr. Macmahon Ball has been dumped
again by Our Foreign Policy. Dumped
after a dazzling Evatt somersault in Japan
last year, Mr. Ball resigned on the spot.
It was his first experience of Our Foreign
Policy’s “larrikin strain,” as his colleague,
Mr. Hasluck (also resigned), had just
called it, citing, in another graphic
phrase, its' disposition to “change its
plumage, even in mid-flight.”
For some six months nothing more was
heard of Mr. Ball. Apparently he
somehow expiated his fault and was
restored to favor, for last month
Our Foreign Policy announced that
Mr. Ball would head a five-weeks
“goodwill mission” bearing gifts “to
Java, Malaya, Burma, Indo-China,
China, the Philippines and possibly
Siam.” His companions were “an educa-
tion and supply officer” and a cadet from
External Affairs Department. .The gifts
embraced:
£410,000-worth of relief supplies, “mainly
clothing and footwear,”
£30,000 for “educational aid, chiefly text-
books” [no doubt stacks of Information
Department pamphlets about Australia’s
“Golden Age”],
And the offer of £60,000-worth of scholar-
ships for “about 25” selected Asiatic students
in establishments variously described as
“universities, technical colleges and teachers’
training colleges,” and “institutions where
emphasis will be placed on education in
engineering, veterinary and agricultural
science.”
Dr. Evatt described the mission as
“part of the world-wide programme of
U.N.E.S.C.O. to bring about greater
understanding between nations”; its
object was “educational (for the Asiatics)
as well as goodwill,” and “he hoped it
would strengthen ties of friendship be-
tween Australians and the peoples of
south-east Asia.” This seemed to allow
Mr. Ball some latitude. Dr. Evatt ex-
pressed confidence that “neither the Gov-
ernment nor the people in any country
visited by the mission would do anything
but welcome it.”
Canberra’s hopefulness notwithstand-
ing, the storm that struck Mr. Ball on
arrival in Malaya was one of those Singa-
pore busters of wide renown. Some ad-
vance wind of it reached the mission, for
it appeared two days late from Batavia,
“cutting the visit to Malaya from four
days to two.” Arrivals just ahead of it
had been some 30 Asiatics repatriated
from Australia by Mr. Calwell, in-
cluding two Chinese (non-Malayans) with
Australian wives, these refused landing
permits as non-Malayans and ordered to
be returned to this country.
In Mr. Ball’s honor the U.K. High
Commissioner, Mr. Malcolm MacDonald,
gave a dinner at Johore Bahru, where
the Australian Eighth Division made its
last stand on the peninsula in 1941. Mr.
Ball must have felt like one of that com-
pany.
Speaker after speaker arose and attacked
Australian policy. Mr. Ball at the con-
clusion shook hands all round and thanked
Mr. MacDonald for “an unpleasant even-
ing.” In the same strain Mr. MacDonald
replied, “It was one of the most unpleasant
we have had for a long time.”,
At a press conference Mr. Ball, re-
sponding to feelings expressed (as he
said) “with brutal frankness but great
personal courtesy,” commended a sugges-
tion that a Malayan political mission
should go to Australia to hold discussions
with Dr. Evatt and Mr. Calwell. On the
“misunderstandings” which he was un-
able to iron out Mr. Ball delivered his
opinion that these were “the result of
individual administrative acts, not a
matter of principle.” Earlier at Kuala
Lumpur, being questioned about the
White Australia policy, he said:
There is a new consciousness in Aus-
tralia that she belongs to the Pacific. It
is very likely there will be a change of
Australian opinion in the coming decade.
At Canberra the storm ensuing may
yet equal the one that hit Mr. Ball in
Malaya. Dr. Evatt, looking like Atlas
carrying the weight of Calwellian “ad-
ministrative acts” on his shoulders —and
missing, surely, nothing of the vocal in-
flection with which Mr. Speaker Rosevear
revealed his cynical enjoyment of the
situation—told Parliament “without any
equivocation whatever” that Mr, Ball’s
commission was strictly limited to carry-
ing gifts and doing goodwill. What he
did not explain—and Australia will now
want to know —is: Who does prescribe
Australian foreign policy, and what is it?
Mr*. Ball’s remarks about “a new con-
sciousness in Australia” were no very
obvious departure from Dr. Evatt’s own
views. In Japan he had been the loyal
instrument of Canberra in supporting
Russian opposition to General Mac-
Arthur’s regime. Again, the Russian
policy for Australia, as constantly
asserted by the Communist party here —
voicing what Mr. Chifley and Dr. Evatt
call a “philosophy”—is abolition of
immigration restrictions against Asiatic
peoples. And that means abolition of
this country’s traditional White Australia
policy.
This present mission of Mr. Ball’s
is being sent around a circle of the
very countries in south-east Asia which
the Soviet is at present making its best
efforts to bring under Moscow’s influence.
There have been ample warnings to
Canberra about that. And only last
week the chairman (Mrs. Herbert
Brookes) of Dr. Evatt’s latest pet, the
United Nations Association in this
country, made these comments in Mel-
bourne on Mr. Calwell’s deportations of
“men and women married to British
subjects”:
There is already a change of feeling
among some Australians towards the White
Australia policy. The deportations are
against the British tradition of keeping
homes together. Australia’s immigration
policy does not need radical changes, but
it does want modifying to stop grave in-
justices.
Mr. Ball’s naivete seems to mar him for
distinction as a diplomat, though it will
have done a service to Australians if it
unmasks some of the crudeness of what
passes in Canberra for administration of
External Affairs. His real political
“boner” was, of course, his reference
to “individual administrative acts” as
the cause of misunderstandings, for that
definitely associates Mr. Calwell with
Dr. Evatt in Our Foreign Policy, and
the two have not seen eye-to-eye in that
domain except in that now-painful busi-
ness the support of the Zionist agitation
in Palestine.
Mr. Calwell’s clumsy and unneces-
sarily offensive deportation of the
Malays and Chinese immediately in ques-
tion came promptly on the heels of the
storm he aroused by expelling, or trying
to expel.
The Chinese wife of a Perth man,
The Tongan-born wife and children of
another,
And refusing to admit a Maori soldier
married to an Australian.
The last evoked from the Prime Minister
of New Zealand —perhaps acutely con-
scious of his Maori mandate —a retort
that “any Australian discrimination
against our citizens will be indignantly
and bitterly resented as an unforgivable
insult to our country,” and Mr, Calwell
had to climb down. Does he think
Malayan leaders did not observe it?
By the manner of his treatment of the
Malayan cases he has now angered a
whole sub-continent just to the north of
us, people with whom Dr. Evatt talked of
strengthening “ties of friendship,” and
he has got another Malayan, named
Ibrahim Bin Ahmet, locked up in
Sydney’s Long Bay jail, to be kept there
without trial till he is deported, “probably
about the end of July.” Ibrahim was
arrested on a Grafton plantation, where
his employer had given him five acres
and a house. What would Canberra say
if an Australian were imprisoned in
Singapore without trial for months till
he could be deported?
Burma, too, is in Mr. Ball’s itinerary.
In the House of Commons the other day
a spokesman for the British Government
declined, as not wishing to interfere in
Australian concerns, to protest against
another Calwell deportation order against
a British subject, Joseph Addison
Martin, because his mother is a Burmese.
Our Foreign Policy seems to think that
the gift of a few bundles of Disposals
Commission shirts and boots can smooth
away such “misunderstandings.”
Apart from the consideration that this
blundering will undo years of good work
in the interpretation of our vital White
Australia policy before this cockeyed
and offensive “Government” of today
came along, one important call now is
for definition of just what people this
Chifley Cabinet bars from recognition
as British subjects, or, to follow the de-
scription under the new legislation
accepted from the Socialists in Britain,
as “Commonwealth citizens.” The
British Government is working hard to
develop in Malaya a self-governing
British Dominion. Malayans, like Indians
and Pakistanis, have not ceased to be
British subjects. The French, Dutch
and American Governments, whom
Dr. Evatt is trying to bind within
his Pacific region co-operative body, are
none of them likely in the least to sym-
pathise with this harsh and clumsy
treatment by the Chifley Government of
individuals belonging to the Pacific
peoples within that region.
With U.S.A. facing the Soviet in the
sharpest political hostility over the future
of Japan, and Manchuria, Korea and
Northern China fast going into the Com-
munist melting-pot, what is Australian
“policy”—leaving the policy dictated by
wharfies aside—doing but playing flag-
rantly into the hands of the Soviet’s Far
Eastern “Cominform” at Bangkok, from
which centre agents are out in great
numbers on the job of trying to pro-
selytise all those countries on Mr. Ball’s
visiting list? Where does Calwell finish
and Evatt begin? And where —oh,
where! —does Mr. Macmahon Ball fit in?
Not Annihilation—New
States!
Negotiations for amalgamation of the
Liberal and Country parties failed last
week, as they had failed before. They
might have had a chance had the dis-
cussions been left to Premier Hollway
and Deputy-Premier McDonald, with Mr.
Playford called in quietly as a mutual
friend and a very successful exponent of
unity in his own State, where there was
never much of a Country party ; certainly
they would not have collapsed so swiftly.
But other gentlemen. Liberals, insisted on
presenting the Agrarians with their views,
and hectoring counsel, also unsolicited,
came from the Sydney morning papers.
The Country party is older than the
Liberal party (People’s party in Queens-
land), and, as Mr. Fadden pointed out
in a shattering reply to the Sydney “Daily
Telegraph,” “the leader has no power to
extinguish it at will by merging with an-
other political group.”
That power rests in the hands of the
members of the party, and it can be ex-
pressed only at representative conferences,
where all members and branches have an
equal voice. Rural workers, farmers and
people in country towns who form the back-
bone of the Country party have the final
say. ,
Elementary and irrefutable; yet sur-
render of the body without reference to
the backbone was proposed. This in
supercilious contempt of the facts of
history and the irresistible pressure of
common needs.
When a crisis develops because
“Labor” goes off its head or yields
dangerously to its wild men the Country
party invariably co-operates with the
Liberals, or whatever they choose to call
themselves, for the restoration of respon-
sible government and the rule of law.
It did so in Victoria after the late erup-
tion of Communist strikes; in the Com-
monwealth for long periods (1923-29,
Bruce-Page; 1934-39, Lyons-Page); in
N. S. Wales for the nine years 1932-41
(Stevens-Bruxner), and in Westralia after
“Labor” went to pieces during the con-
scription period. Of a certainty it will
do so again in the Commonwealth next
year when the Chifleys collect their issue
and cease to be in a position to subsidise
immigrant Communists, who ought to be
deported (and would be if they had gone
to America instead of coming to Aus-
tralia), out of the public funds.
That there will be another friendly and
fruitful association cannot seriously be
doubted, least of all by Mr. Casey, who sat
with Dr, Page in the Lyons Cabinet for
nearly five years. And, if city controllers
of his organisation can be weaned from
their curious notion, expressed by Mr. W.
H. Spooner in Sydney, that it is their
group’s mission “to proceed unaided to
provide for all sections the truly national
party that Australia wants,” they will see
Country-party men win seats that Liberals
could not possibly win.
There should be no mistaking the
temper of country people. It was ex-
pressed to some purpose on May 29,
when the greatest relative majorities
against permanent Canberra domination
of prices and charges were cast in country
electorates, except those which are mainly
industrial. Country people are fed-up,
not only with Canberra “controls” but
with Big-City “controls,” which nowadays
so often mean wicked Communist attacks
on land and sea transport, fuel-supply
and industry, attacks never resisted
at Canberra or Sydney by those whose
duty it is to keep the wheels moving and
enforce respect for industrial law.
Resistance was offered by Mr. Hanlon,
who has since blotted his copybook by
taking Canberra’s side in the prices-and-
charges argument and proposing to repeal
his emergency strike legislation, but it left
outback Queenslanders cold. Speaking
at Townsville, Ernest Evans, the State
member for Mirani, said “The people of
Brisbane did not suffer as a result of the
railway strike and the Communist boy-
cott of shipping and ports, but country
people, particularly in the north and west,
were deprived of the necessities of life,
and it will be a long time before the losses
inflicted on primary producers and small
business people are overtaken.”
These strong remarks were made at the
annual conference of the northern
Country party, held in Townsville and
“attended by delegates representing the
north, from Mossman to Sarina and from
Townsville to the far west,” which re-
sulted in the party “placing itself firmly
behind the move for a North Queensland
State.” The same leaven is working in
New England and other neglected parts
of the Commonwealth, and it is all to the
good.
These isolated Australian communities
see in the formation of New States a
means of protecting themselves against
the crimes of Communists —all centred
in southern cities —against the audacities
of southern bureaucrats and against the
weakness and greed of southern poli-
ticians, who aim at giving the Big Cities
predominance in the Parliament at Can-
berra for all time. They see in it also
a means of bringing population to their
stagnant towns (for, as the census figures
dismally show, population throngs to the
cities) and prosperity to their industries,
now the sport of Sydney and Melbourne
wreckers. They know that the proper
and healthy working of a federal union
depends upon the admission to Statehood
of provinces and territories fairly
entitled to local self-government, and that
there have been 10 of these admissions
in the U.S.A. since 1889, with two more
projected, and not one in Australia since
1901. In short, they have the right idea.
And city Liberals other than Mr. Spender
should show some interest in it.
Servicemen Dumped.
More than a month has passed since Mr.
Holloway assured the House of Reps, that
he and Mr. Dedman would make it their
business to find out why the Building
Workers Industrial Union is killing the
Commonwealth Reconstruction Training
Scheme for ex-servicemen.
The scheme stalled early this year. At
the time the R.S.L. in N.S.W. declared;
It is being deliberately sabotaged by the
Communist-run 8.W.1.U. Training as
bricklayers and carpenters of young ex-
servicemen is halted because that union’s
representatives on the mixed industrial com-
mittees governing it object to further train-
ing because there are “no jobs” for those
trained. That the decisions of the com-
mittees have to be unanimous enables the
union veto to prevent training.
In Victoria, where precisely the same
thing has happened, the R.S.L. executive
has published a scathing report declaring
that the prospects for the scheme “could
not be worse without completely collaps-
ing.” Placing of ex-service tradesmen, it
declares, has) become nearly impossible.
Apart from the thousands unable to start
training, now turning away in disgust,
there are 1000 young ex-servicemen who,
“through some circumstance,” have either
reached the required 40 per cent, effici-
ency and cannot get jobs in the building
trades, or who have actually been placed
and now find themselves turned off.
Fundamentally the trouble is outright
Communist opposition, in the interests of
“full employment” of existing members,
to any further functioning of the training
scheme. The employers, on Holloway’s
admission, have been “playing the game”
loyally. One minor obstacle is declared
to be official delay in the passing of
trainees’ papers between the Common-
wealth Employment Service and the Post-
war Reconstruction Department; “a lag
of a month between these departments
has often occurred,” says the Victorian
R.S.L. On May 6 Dedman in a statement
to Parliament dressed up the union argu-
ments to look like something reasonable
—shortage of materials was its burden —
but Holt promptly exploded this by re-
vealing that the 8.W.1.U. committeemen
had, under their veto, refused to approve
employment of trainees in any establish-
ment owned by members of the Timber
Merchants’ Association and gave the
reason:
In 1946 Judge Kelly, of the Arbitration
Court, deleted certain clauses from the
carpenters and joiners’ award as the result
of breaches of the law by that division of
the 8.W.1.U. and as a disciplinary measure.
The clauses in question granted to the union
the right of entry, the right to post notices,
and the right to inspect employers’ wage-
sheets. The Judge told the union that it
could apply for reinsertion of the clauses
upon its giving satisfactory assurances to the
Court that it would in future abide by the
Arbitration Act and awards thereunder.
In August, 1947, the union made such
application, but on September 1 the Judge,
deeming the assurances were inadequate,
declined to grant it. Since that time officials
of the union have not had the right of
entry to premises of any member of the
Timber Merchants’ Association. The union
has taken this particular action in re-
taliation.
And so when one of the members of the
T. asks for a trainee the 8.W.1.U.
veto on the committee running the ser-
vicemen’s training scheme refuses the re-
quest. And the union says the supply of
trainee labor is outrunning supply of
materials!
Holloway, replying to Holt, admitted
the justice of his comments, and that
“there is no cause to warrant the continu-
ance of the present position.” But if he
has carried out his promise to drag the
reluctant Dedman along with him to “in-
terview the committee,” there has been
no sign of it. Dedman’s answer to a
Victorian R.S.L. deputation the other day
was a lemon.
Yet Dr. Evatt has been campaigning at
U. against the veto as a matter of
high principle, High principle, forsooth!


PLAIN ENGLISH
Plums For The Reds.
Mr. Strachey, the British Food Minister,
has repeatedly stated that the difficulties
of the situation with which he has to
cope have been increased by strikes and
slow-motion handling of ships in Aus-
tralian ports, and last week another
appeal for acceleration of the snail’s
pace was issued at his instance. A single
day saved in the turn-round, it was said,
would mean a saving of 100,000 tons of
shipping.
Simultaneously the Food for Britain
people announced the exhaustion of
supplies in the London depot from which
10s. express-delivery parcels are distri-
buted, and gave “the slower shipping
turn-round” as a cause. And the C.S.R.
chairman at the company’s annual meet-
ing said that “very heavy financial losses”
had been imposed on North Queensland
canefarmers, and further losses which
might run to “several millions of pounds”
were threatened, because the handling
rate in North Queensland ports had
fallen to “less than half what it was
before the war” ; this with “40 per cent,
more tonnage” employed.
The Chifley “Government,” of course,
was not interested. Its Food Controller
and its Mr, Dedman tried to turn people
against the Food for Britain movement
when it was launched. The general atti-
tude of its Mr, Ashley is that all com-
plaints of waterfront delays are un-
founded.
But Healy, general Secretary of the
Waterside Workers’ Federation, came in
with a characteristic outburst of Com-
munist prevarication. He denied that
the sturdy fellows in N.Q. ports were
working below capacity, and alleged that
those in all ports gave the maximum of
effort in the minimum of time to Food
for Britain, a cause dear to their honest
hearts. This when it is notorious that
the union under his direction, between
March, 1947, and March, 1948, engaged
in lawless strikes which held up great
supplies of foodstuffs consigned to
Britain —held them up for two weeks in
the port of Sydney and for four weeks
in Queensland ports.
With no directions, and no questions
asked, Canberra put this Healy on each
of its Stevedoring Industry Commissions.
It is on record that, during the Com-
munist blockade of Queensland, the
Manchester Irishman expressed his con-
tempt for the No. 2 commission, now
headed by a Judge, and his hatred for
the institutions of the country which has
been too kind to him, in terms which,
under any Government worthy of the
name, would have been immediately fol-
lowed by his arrist under the Crimes
Act, as a preliminary to deportation;
Notwithstanding any order from the
Stevedoring Industry Commission or any
law, the Waterside Workers’ Federation still
intends to defy the Queensland Govern-
ment and see that no cargo is moved in
or out of Queensland.
In his useful role of watchdog, Mr.
Lang has brought it out that this ruffian
was paid —paid out of the bloated tax-
revenue—for attending the meeting at
which his declaration of war on Aus-
tralia and Britain was made. Canberra
allows him “30s. a day sitting fee” and
“30s, a day travelling expenses when
absent overnight from his home.” Since
April, 1942, he has claimed and received
£ll21 —far more than has been doled
out to any widow of a serviceman who
fell in the Middle East,
Nor is Healy the only immigrant Com-
munist leader whose “claims” on the
public purse have been recognised by
the Chifleys. Elliott (Seamen’s Union),
Healy’s confederate in the blockade of
Queensland, has drawn £543 “as a
member of the Maritime Industry Com-
mission.” Thornton, the Ironworkers’
boss, that advocate of a Hitler peace, was
given £533 for “two overseas trips as a
trade-union delegate.” And the clutching
hand of Williams (Miners’ Federation)
pulled in £llß3 for a year’s “work” on
a “board of inquiry into the coal in-
dustry.” In the plight to which Victoria
has been reduced by the strikes and go-
slow pranks of Williams’s union, with
55 p.c. gas cuts added to 30 p.c. railway
cuts and spreading unemployment be-
cause “coal stocks are exhausted,” this
particular payment has sharpened the
public resentment expressed so forcibly
at the prices-and-charges referendum.
Many Victorians would like nothing
better than to grab Williams by the scruff
of the neck and the seat of the pants and
ride him on a rail to a vessel bound
for his native Wales.
But to the Chifley “Government” all
Communists are devotees of a
“philosophy” which must on no account
be interfered with, and their leaders,
whose counterparts in the U.S.A. are
being expelled as enemies, have special
qualifications for public employment and
for rewards from the purse that was once
the people’s.
Universities and Congestion.
“El V.” on our centres of learning and
culture:
Australian universities are very overcrowded.
Sydney’s, a typical case, has reasonable accom-
modation for teaching 3000 students, with staffs
and equipment to match; it has to cater for
about 12,000, many of them ex-servicemen
and -women. In numbers its student body ex-
ceeds great American universities such as the
universities of Pennsylvania, Harvard and
Boston, and dwarfs Princeton and Yale.
The true function of a university is the pro-
motion of culture and learning and the develop-
ment of inquiry and research. Australian uni-
versities have become in the nature of huge
technical colleges in which the main purpose
is to enable students, by a breakneck course of
lectures, to absorb enough book- and bench-
work to scramble through examinations.
There is no tutorial service as there is at
Oxford and Cambridge, no research except in
the strictly utilitarian departments in which
research provides the incentive of enabling its
pursuer to become a “specialist.”
In the bustle of the factory atmosphere of
these institutipns there is no time to teach
students to think except in a strictly utilitarian
way. History is taught in the sketchiest fashion
and usually only with enthusiasm where there
is a political end to serve. Australian history,
understanding of which is necessary for a
balanced understanding of progress, is taught
inadequately or scarcely at all.
At Sydney University Bishop O’Brien, an
outside lecturer, has been doing his best to
instil a love of Australian history into an
all-too-large class of students with all-too-little
time to devote to the subject.
It is almost unbelievable that any country
with the standing of a nation could possess so
little in the way of efficient textbooks and
dissected historical work, especially in view of
the rich stores of material available in the

archives.
The average Australian graduate in history
knows more about Stalin and Henry the
Eighth’s wives (even if .not very much at
that) than he or she does about Parkes, Deakin,
Macquarie and the development of our own
country. 0
In literature the universities of Australia are
not a flowering field. Where are the poets,
the novelists, the essayists of Sydney University,
which for a generation or two has been as big
in numbers as Oxford and which now has about
four times the normal membership of that great
English university and of Princeton and Yale?
An odd island like Chris Brennan is about all
the land visible in a wide ocean.
There seems to be a good deal of argument
in favor of the dismembering of our greater
universities, with the remission of training for
at least some of the professions to technical
colleges or institutes, leaving the core of re-
search and culture to form the basis of the
universities, which could then perform their
true functions.
There is, also, an argument for more univer-
sities. If Brisbane could afford one when it
could muster only four professors and about
150 students, so could a lot of other centres
in Australia today if they were given the oppor-
tunity. These new bodies would relieve existing
corporations in the great wens from such un-
satisfactory expedients as that to which Mel-
bourne has recently resorted in transferring a
number of its students to a makeshift annexe
at Mildura. And it would break down the
congestion in some faculties and allow the
central bodies to devote their funds now dis-
persed over many faculties to concentrate on
the few which call for great expenditures and
wide scientific resources. t
Semple on Communists.
In contrast with the Chifley crowd at
Canberra, the N.Z. Government is taking
off the gloves against Communists.
Robert Semple, its Minister for Railways
and Works, fortified by a visit to Aus-
tralia, where he observed “the Queens-
land Labor Government fighting against
a Communist-inspired and -directed in-
dustrial strike which threatened the State’s
economic existence,” has undertaken a
strenuous lecture tour of N.Z., and has
written a striking booklet. Why I Fight
Communism.
Prime Minister Fraser writes a fore-
word, extolling Mr. Semple’s spirit, and
declares; —
He is determined that, so far as he can
influence public opinion the trade-union
movement shall be entirely freed from the
danger of Communists, who would use it
for their own evilly-designed purpose and
wreck it in the process; and that, above all,
N.Z. and its people shall be saved from
even a semblance of the fate that has over-
taken so many European peoples and coun-
tries.
Mr. Semple dedicates himself to a fight
for the “freedom of peoples privi-
leged to enjoy the British way of life”
against “an enemy sworn to destroy the
things we cherish.” His documented in-
dictment of the gangs which Moscow is
planting in many countries, including
Australia and N.Z., to disrupt society,
overthrow democracy and introduce civil
war is comprehensive and convincing.
He quotes Elliott, Communist boss of
the Australian Seamen’s Union (whose ex-
penses on overseas missions the Chifley
Government actually subsidises out of tax-
payers’ money), as praising “the wonder-
ful job the Communists are doing” in
turning eastern Europe into slave States
and their Governments into a despotism
ruled by secret police and maintained by
means of systematic murders and slave
camps for the elimination of all objectors.
As Field-Marshal Smuts has just said:
“This is the form of the war currently
being waged, and as deadly as any.” To
Canberra it is just a “philosophy.”

£30,000,000 That Wasn't.
A wintry Sunday being the kind of day
in Canberra when to the general week-
end somnolence of the place is added a
predilection for hugging fires, it is not to
be wondered at that anybody trying to
display an unwonted interest in the
nation’s business should be caught half-
napping, as it were. Anyhow, something
must have bitten Mr. Pollard, the Minis-
ter for Commerce and Agriculture, or
one of his offsiders, on Sunday, June 6,
for on that day the reporters found
themselves with a startling news item.
On Monday the nation’s morning
newspapers shook the breakfast-tables
with the momentous announcement
that Mr. Pollard proposed to “hand back
to woolgrowers about £30,000,000 from
profits on the resale of surplus war-time
wool stocks.” The notion that Mr. Pol-
lard’s colleagues would give anything
back to anybody, however much they
(Continued on page 10 .)
FINANCE AND “PHILOSOPHY.”
“Mr. Chifley, while admitting to increased revenue of £46 million for the current financial year, and to the Government’s
paying over £3300 to four Communists in ‘fees and expenses’ since 1942, has declined to offer overburdened taxpayers any
prospect of tax relief.”
“On second thoughts I think it best,
To keep YOURS in the old oak chest.”

MADE SPECIALLY TO PREVENT SORE THROATS
were entitled to it, was in itself so in-
credible that everybody interested made
another reading. It was plain enough,
as printed in Sydney “Herald”:
Canberra, Sunday.—Profits estimated at
£3O million will be distributed to graziers
whose wool was acquired from 1939 to
1946 under the war-time wool-purchase
agreement.... Mr. Pollard said today that
brokers were now helping to prepare a
list of growers, and that distribution would
be in proportion to growers’ contributions
of wool during the purchase arrange-
ment—
There was more |bout whether the
cash would be paid in one year or spread
over seven in order to break down the
income-tax blow. A sort of a restrained
cheer went up from the wool country
a Queensland graziers’ federation an-
nounced a plan to reinvest their share
of the doings—and a lot of people began
wondering how much they’d have to
spend.
Then somebody—it might have been
his leader or a Treasury official or a tax
commissioner—got hold of Mr- Pollard,
and two days later Mr. Pollard was tell-
ing the House that the press reports were
“misleading”:
The Government would distribute what-
ever profits would be available, but the
figure would not be known until all war-time
surplus wool had been sold.
Earlier he had told reporters that it
would take two to five years to wind
up the J.O. scheme ; there would be legis-
lation next September to provide for
distribution of the profits when J.O. was
wound up. After which a cold silence
fell upon everything, and woolgrowers
went sadly back to cutting burrs or chas-
ing crows, feeling like the man who faded
to locate the pea under the right thimble.
POLITICAL POINTS
Ruritania, perhaps ? Baritana ? Nay.
The land is Australia, Australia today.
Chifley to the N.S.W. A.L.P. delegates,
who—Pinks, Reds and all—greeted him
as a conquering hero:
I ask you, in this period between elec-
tions, never to let yourselves be sidetracked
from the great ideal for which the “Labor”
movement stands.
Well, what about putting up a sign with
three letters in which the “ideal” will be
always visible : the letters L.S.D.?
More trouble has come to industries
and essential services because N.S.W.
coalminers refuse to dig enough coal.
This favored section is now demand-
ing • a “working” week of 35 hours,
and the southern fields have threatened
to close because of a wrangle as to who
should have the job of looking after pit
ponies. In Victoria the Government —
partly because the Gasmen’s Union, to
spite Conciliation Commissioner Black-
burn, V.C., refuses to work overtime—
has had to impose severe restrictions on
gas-users and railway travellers and con-
signees, and industries may have to limp
along with a four- day week.
Justice Davidson, after exhaustive in-
quiry, told the Canberra and N.S.W.
Governments two years ago that the only
hope for immediate relief from the
chronic coal shortage was to work a
second shift in the N.S.W-_ mines. That
the Communist-bossed Miners’ Federa-
tion will not permit, and neither Chifley
nor McGirr nor their “Joint Control
Board” would dare to suggest it.
A Sydney businessman filling in the
Fuel Board’s latest questionnaire began to
think of other petrol-consumers he had
heard of. He rang the board and in-
quired as to the classification of Healy,
Thornton, Elliott and others who haunt
Marx House, Sydney, which has figured
in the purchase of a fleet of Catalinas,
The answer?. “Don’t be silly. We can’t
tell you that.”
Launching of the 17th vessel built by
B.H.P. at Whyalla (S.A.) was followed
by an Essington Lewis announcement that
the company had decided to establish
steelworks there. A fine example of
B.H.P.’s zeal for decentralisation of in-
dustry and population and a tribute to
the confidence inspired by Tom Playford’s
honest and steady administration of his
State’s affairs.
Chifley,'it seems, did not have anyone
in particular in mind when he said he
would uphold Ward against a “larrikin
lawyer.” Neither did Paul last
year when he condemned “the larrikin
strain” in Our Foreign Policy. Presum-
ably Canberra regards itself now as all
square.
Hollowayhas not been called to
account for having allowed Garden to
haunt Ward’s office as a privileged
member of Ward’s staff when he was
nominally part of the Holloway outfit,
Labor and National Service; part of it
from September, 1943, till Garden’s en-
forced exit in December, 1947. There
was a disposition to spare Holloway be-
cause of his age and quavering courtesy.
It should not survive his refusal of an
inquiry into the proceedings of Urquhart,
also part of his outfit, and his affectation
of ignorance of Urquhart’s evidence as
to “Bill’s” six bank accounts, his private
safe, his punting “in hundreds” —some-
times on the Randwick flat —his exemp-
tion of “certain barmaids” from the call-
up and his use of hire-cars charged up to
the taxpayers when engaged on Ward’s
“electoral work.” Consideration for
Holloway’s infirmities should not deter the
Opposition any longer. It should think
only that he is a Minister of the Crown,
even if its private opinion is that, like
some of his colleagues, he is not a Minis-
ter’s bootlace.

With about 10,000 ballot-papers outstand- /

polled in the State and so was the adverse
majority (234,301), This with “Labor” in
office at Canberra since October, 1941,
and at Brisbane since June, 1932, and for
14 years before that, and with both
crowds shouting “Yes” till they were
black in the face.
“Argus” line over a message from
Singapore:
Malayans do not judge Australia by its
Government.
Well, that’s a comfort!
This will be a fateful month for Tas-
mania’s Cosgrove Administration. The
State Parliament meets on June 22, and
the Leg. Council, in which “Labor” has
only D’Alton, of dogracing celebrity, is
expected to refuse Supply, though not
before the new “controls” are arranged.
The Government should have gone to
the country of its own volition after the
proceedings which ended in a 10-to-2 jury
verdict for the Premier.
The Country party has rejected Liberal
overtures for amalgamation. It has a
lively sense of what Shakspeare wrote:
“An two men ride a horse, one must
ride behind.”
Yielding to union pressure, the Han-
lons are repealing their anti-Communist
strike legislation, designed to- stop savage
intimidation of workers and their women-
folk, Hollway is sticking to his anti-
Communist strike legislation. Union
pressure doesn’t put the wind up him.
The umpteenth grand “drive” to con-
serve petrol, accompanied by the familiar
threats to all and sundry except the new
privileged “Labor” aristocracy has been
called off. The “Government” now
“hopes” to save 10,000 tons a month by
an “economy drive, rather than by mak-
ing a further cut in the ration,” and the
usual “spokesman” did his stuff:
We cannot tell what may have to be
done if the dollar position deteriorates.
At the moment we are trying to tighten up
by preventing leakages.
One obvious method of saving the juice-
making ticket currency continuous, in-
stead of forcing motorists to fill up with
unwanted petrol at the end of each
month —won’t be entertained. But then,
every gallon used means another
for the overstuffed Commonwealth
Treasury.
Whether they like it or not, farmers
are committed to the International
Wheat Agreement, their only hope
of escape being the faint possibility of
non-ratification by the U.S.A. Argentina
and Russia are not parties to the thing,
and either or both could knock it end-
ways with a dumping programme. Re-
vealing that members of the Wheat Board
did not share his views, Pollard, the
“responsible” Minister, sneered that he
did “not bother very much about the
board,” and alleged that two members,
Teasdale and Armstrong, had refused to
■treat correspondence on the U.K. wheat
deal as “top secret,” although “leakages
on international agreements meant gamb-
ling and nefarious practices.” “Gambling
and nefarious practices”! How high-
minded.
In 12 months there has been an exodus
of 250 people from the Atherton Table-
land, one of the parts of the earth favored
by nature, and Carpentaria, which em-
braces all the vast Cape York peninsula,
has lost 250. Small figures, perhaps, but
chilling frontier facts. Brisbane and all
the other Big Cities incessantly gain.
“The information is being obtained,
and will be furnished to the honorable
member as soon as possible.” That was
Ward’s answer to a series of questions
about Timber, asked by Archie Cameron.
He was not in this cringing mood when
tackled by Tommy White on the griev-
ances of New Guinea public servants ;
as expressed in a cablegram —bogus,
Ward sneeringly suggested. Tommy was
equal to the occasion:
White: I hope the matter will be looked
into, and I anticipate that the Minister
won’t be believed, either in court or Par-
liament or anywhere else.
[The member for Balaclava put a ques-
tion as to Australia’s petrol position.]
Ward; Who signed that message?
White: E. J. Ward, on behalf of J. S.
Garden.
Going to the “Labor” conference in
Sydney, and vomiting threats as to what
he might do to newspapers and unnamed
parties to “the anti-‘Labor’ plot,” Ward
was comforted with a vote of confidence.
Nobody asked him why, if he found it
necessary to have a safe-deposit box, he
didn’t* hire one in the Commonwealth
Bank, reachable by lift from his office,
of which Garden had the run, instead of
in one of those nefarious trading banks
some distance away.
It seems likely that as a result of the
Lords’ rejection of the Criminal Justice
Bill the death penalty will be retained in
Britain, at least for cases of premeditated
murder. Sentimentalists in the Commons
—most of them “Labor” —who were re-
sponsible for the attempt to abolish hang-
ing might profit from a study of crime
statistics in Australian States where
“ ‘Labor’ Governments” shudder at the
thought of carrying out the death penalty
on even the most brutal murderer. Last
week two more killings were added to
Sydney’s long list. One victim, a criminal
with a brutal record, was no loss to the
community. The other, an elderly room-
seeking widow, was battered to death
in circumstances so frightful as to set
shocked people wondering if it wasn’t
another case of decent womanhood being
destroyed by a monster who should not
have been at large.
When it seemed that the A.L.P. con-
ference in Sydney might come out strong
against the Communist conspiracy, dele-
gates from the Communist-controlled
Ironworkers and Building Workers
walked out. An unnecessary shuffling or
feet, for the president, Facing-both-ways
Ferguson, who was a party to the Com-
munist blockade of Queensland, depre-
cated “loose talk about banning
minorities,” and allowed that the depart-
ing delegation had “a perfect right” to
walk out; “we will respect their deci-
sion.” And Maloney, M.L.C., found him-
self in a hopeless minority when he
objected to “a long motion on inter-
national affairs,” ending in a demand for
outlawing of the use of the atom-bomb.
Said Maloney:
If this motion is carried you will link
yourselves up with Russia. I move an
amendment: “We condemn the continuous
use of the U.N.O. veto by the Soviet Union
and urge that it discontinues its sabotage
of the Atlantic Charter and the settlement
of the problems of peace.”
The Maloney amendment was rejected
and the link with Russia accepted.
From “Punter Once”:
Hughes rarely speaks nowadays, but he ripped
out an embarrassing interjection when “p°or
old Holloway” was trying to wash his hands
of the Urquhart affair. To old Parliamentary
hands it seemed that Billy was about to remind
the “Government” of the action he took in
the Jensen case; and perhaps the reminder will
come.
Jensen was a member of four Ministries
—three “Labor” and one “Nationalist”—in
which Billy was top dog. In 1918 a Navy
Commission reported on “a very calamitous
transaction for the Commonwealth dating back
to 1915, when Jensen was “Labor’s” Minister
for the Navy: the purchase, for £55,000, of
the Shaw wireless concern. The £55,000 was
paid to Shaw’s credit in a Melbourne bank.
He drew out £5200 “in notes of large de-
nomination.” Going straight to Parliament
House, then in Melbourne, he handed a roll
to “Labor” Senator Long, who presently paid
£2400 into his account. Three years later Long
said he had received £1290 from Shaw and
had “won £IIOQ at the races” from unspecified
bookmakers —in these “Labor” cases book-
makers are never specified.
Public opinion, a real thing then, was strongly
moved by the Commission’s report. Jensen
pleaded that he had been “exonerated from
any corruption,” and refused to resign. Hughes
dismissed him (December 13, 1918) and, a
week later, Long resigned. What a change has
come over the political scene, though not in
all features.
“KNOW YE THE LAND?”
There’s a land where the thrifty are
savagely taxed,
Incentive is stifled and industry axed;
Where a fourth of the folk who in jobs
can be found
Are paid by the others for m pushing them
round;
Where Communists boycott, betray and
blockade.
With impunity all, and their leaders are
paid ;
Where Honor and Duty and Law are
“all rot,”
The slacker exalted, the soldier forgot;
Where Booze and Blackmarkets and
Betting are “tops”
And cities are pockmarked with lottery
shops;
Where the Leader one moment a Golden
Age guides.
The next, on the whirlwind Depression he
rides ;
Where foreign affairs, bringing ugly
rebuffs.
Are “managed” by tyros and waterfront
toughs;
Where tribunes award themselves rises
and pensions
And other such prizes of stunning
dimensions;
Where the test that J. Ccesar applied to
his wife
Is suspended for pals when suspicion is
rife —
The Leader declares, with a visage of
wood,
If HE don’t suspect them then nobody
should. ,

PERSONAL ITEMS
Seven Australians were included in
this year’3 Birthday Honors List. Albert
Dunstan, former Premier of Victoria,
received a K.C.M.G., and the half-dozen
who became Knights Bachelor included
two other Victorians —Dr. John Newman
Morris, a surgeon in the top rank of his
profession, and John Medley, Melbourne
University’s Vice-Chancellor —two West
Australians, Norbert Keenan, K.C., and
C. G. Latham; Justice Mayo of South
Australia’s Supreme Court and G. B.
Rolph of Launceston, Tasmania, manag-
ing-director of the “Examiner,” member
of Launceston Hospital Board, the
Northern Tasmanian Development
League, the Crippled Children’s Society,
Red Cross and a host of other organisa-
tions.
Keenan was admitted to the West Aus-
tralian bar 52 years ago —he was already
a Barrister-at-Law of King’s Inn, Dublin,
and of the Middle Temple—and took silk
in 1908. He was Mayor of Kalgoorlie
at the beginning of the century, repre-
sented the goldfields in the W.A.
Assembly for some years, and was
Attorney-General in the Moore Govern-
ment from 1906-09. He came back to
the Assembly in 1930 as member for
Nedlands, and is still there.
Charles George Latham, an Old Digger
of the 16th Battalion, has been in Parlia-
ment most of the time since he came back
from World War I, He represented
York as Country-party member for 20
years, was Deputy-Premier and Minister
for Lands and Health under Mitchell
from 1930-33, and led the Opposition
from then until 1942, when he was sent to
the Senate for a year. Since 1946 he has
been a member of the Legislative Council,
and during the war he was Deputy-
Director of Commonwealth Loans in
W.A.
The sturdiest knight in the Victorian
Birthday Honors list is Albert Arthur
Dunstan, who wouldn’t look absurd in
compleat armor with lance at charge spur-
ring on an outsize in Clydesdales. One of
the toughest warriors an Opposition ever
had to deal with, he took office in 1935
as head of the first Country-party Gov-
ernment ever known in this country; was
told he would not last a month, but
reigned for 11 years —except for a
humorous interlude of nine days—never
once had an absolute majority and was
never known to lose his temper. A
Wimmera, Mallee and Queensland
farmer, he is weight-for-age the most
energetic of Victoria’s politicians as well
as a masterly tactician —the Opposition
word is cunning. He has lately done good
work as Minister for Health under Holl-
way.
Vice-Chancellor Medley, Melbourne
University’s new knight, is an organiser
rather than a scholar, though he was born
in academic cloisters. His father was an
Oxford don, and he was born at Oxford.
Educated there and at Cambridge, he
served with the British Army in 1914-19,
worked with Gibbs, Bright and Co. for
10 years, was eight years headmaster of
Tudor House School, Moss Vale
(N.S.W.), and then succeeded Professor
Priestley in his present office, which in-
volves administering the affairs of a huge
educational factory with upwards of 9000
students. Accommodation has been his
post-war headache, and it was his drive
which produced the Mildura offshoot.
Medley is a member of the A.8.C., a
trustee of the National Gallery and an
ardent Red Cross worker and isn’t averse
to opening art shows.
When it comes to an argument between
writers and publishers George Sutton,
sketched here by Heth, has a foot in each
camp. He is a writer and composer him-
self, talks books and dogs over Melbourne
radio-stations and is a director and the
Australian representative of Hutchinson’s
of London. The composing part of his
make-up is in the blood; he’s a director
of the old family firm of music-publishers,
Sutton’s, Ltd., and tlie dog talks derive
from the fact that he is Australian chief
of the Tailwaggers’ Society and a vice-
president of the Society for the Protec-
tion of Animals. Born in Ballarat 55
years ago he served four years in World
War One, first with the A.1.F., then with
the R.F.C. In Hitler’s war he was
attached to the Australian Military Mis-
sion in Washington and London, and after
the German collapse he had a good look-
see of the Occupied Zone, including
BOOKS AND DOGS.
Berlin, where, among other places, he
visited Hitler’s air-raid shelter. Heth
made this sketch while Sutton was intro-
ducing to the Sydney book world Lord
Mountevans and June Wright, both of
whom have recent books on Hutchinson’s
list.
First-lieutenant of destroyer or frigate
—known to friend and foe as “Jimmy the
One”—can fairly lay claim to title of
hardest-worked man in the Navy. Duties
range from leave-giving and -taking to
running the canteen, dealing with com-
plaints, cleanliness of the ship and re-
sponsibility to the captain for its fighting
and seamanship efficiency. Lieutenant
David Nicholls, King’s Medal, of frigate
Condamine, still likes “the boats.” Son
of the Speaker of the S.A. Assembly, he
joined Flinders on New Year’s Day, 1936.
First ship was Canberra ; first action was
sinking of two raider supply-ships in the
Indian Ocean a few hours after they had
fuelled Admiral Scheer. Followed de-
stroyer time in Vampire, Norman and
Napier, the last as Fleet destroyer with
the Eastern Battle Fleet, when Napier
landed a Marine Commando Group on
Madagascar. Sticking to “the boats,”
last year of the war found him No. 1
of frigate Gascoyne, charting, sounding
and buoying Leyte Gulf a few hours
before the landing-craft swept ashore*
The battleship bombardment actually
started before the last buoy was laid.
Ashore for a spell at Flinders College,
Nicholls joined Condamine and will sail
shortly for New Guinea, taking Queens-
land’s Governor on a north-coast inspec-
tion tour On the way.
“S.K.”; Any international cricketer
over 40 years of age who runs into a
“patch” is liable to be advised pungently
by the “Hill” to retire into his bathchair ;
but no such exhortation was ever tendered
Sep Carter, who died in Sydney last
week; for at %2, when he made his final
tour of England, he was ’keeping as
well as at any time in his brilliant career.
Incidentally, in getting into that 1921 tour-
ing side under Armstrong—it was Sep’s
tip to Warwick that started the famous
Lord Tennyson incident over the
wrongful closing of the English Test
innings and the unexampled sequel of the
burly Australian captain, after squatting
resolutely on the pitch till the hubbub
died down, bowling two successive
overs —Carter smashed a time-honored
tradition of Australian Test cricket.
Collins, anxious to have Oldfield, his
A.I.F, XI ’keeper, in the team, pressed
successfully for his inclusion in the first
nine picked. It looked as if Sep would
be dropped, for no touring side previously
had included two ’keepers from the same
State. But in the Australia v. The Rest
match which was to determine the balance
of the touring side Sep Carter pulled
down a magnificent catch which rocked
the ground and led to his preference over
the Victorian ’keeper, who was thought
to have had the second ’keepership sewn
up. Sep went to England and “kept” in
four of the Tests. Regarded by many
as the greatest ’keeper of them all, and
in particular a wizard at anticipation on
a turning wicket, Sep Carter was a grand
fellow by any standard.
J. O’Keefe, Inspector-superintendent of
Police in Melbourne, who will be Acting-
Chief during Commissioner Duncan’s
absence in Europe on the International
Police Commission, owns a most
amazing memory. In a murder inquest
on one occasion he spoke for one hour
40 minutes without a single stop, ■ mis-
take or repetition and without notes,
although nine-tenths of his evidence con-
cerned dates, times and places in one of
the most baffling cases in the history of
Victorian crime detection. He had memo-
rised the whole business. He has been
the chief sleuth in most of the State’s
major crimes over the last 20 years, and
it was he who solved the dreadful Sode-
man murders,
Australian concertgoers remember
Hubert Eisdell, the English lyric tenor,
just dead in Canada at 65, as a>highly-
artistic singer of ballads. He toured here
in 1920-21, arriving on the heels of John
McCormack, who, centre of a public
storm over the playing of the National
Anthem, abruptly cancelled his remain-
ing concerts. Eisdell took over the
vacant dates and his tour was a tremen-
dous success. Bom in London, and edu-
cated at Highgate and Caius College,
Cambridge, he was an all-round athlete.
He played soccer and cricket and was a
noted shot and an expert fly fisherman.
As well as being in great demand for
oratorio work he was a familiar figure
at the great music festivals and with
orchestras under all the top-line con-
ductors —the Queen’s Hall was one of
his favorite stamping grounds. He
toured the U.S. and Canada with Liza
Lehmann and, to show his versatility,
shared the honors with Marie Tempest
in the satirical play “Midsummer Mad-
ness.” His sales of recordings for those
years were phenomenal enough to cause
even a modern Tin Pan Alleyite to lift
a respectful eyebrow—so,ooo of Tosti’s
“Parted” in the first two weeks. Joining
the Volunteer Reserve of the R.N. in
1912, Eisdell served at sea almost
throughout the 1914-18 war. He married
a Tasmanian girl, Kitty Parker, a grande
daughter of Joseph Cleary, Minister of

About the time of the depression, G. F,
Knowles appeared on the Liverpool
(Eng.) waterfront asking ship captains to
allow his organisation, the Seafarers’ Edu-
cation Service, to supply their ships witb t
books. He was regarded mostly as a*
crank, the general opinion being that sea-
men in the mass didn’t want books, but
presently fo’c’sles began to have books
lying about in them, and by last year 1200
ships of 130 companies carried libraries
totalling 180,000 books of all kinds.
Knowles and his wife cast up in Bris-
bane the other week aboard a Blue Funnel
liner, enjoying a world cruise given him

Dead in Queensland, ex-Senator
Thomas William Crawford, who survived
practically a generation of service in
Canberra’s upper chamber. In his prime
he was one of the strongest personalities
in Queensland public life. A printers’-
union official, he took to sugar-farming
and, as president of the then all-powerful
Australian Sugar Producers’ Association,
shared the kingship of the industry with
the association’s remarkable secretary,
Pritchard. Crawford’s stablemates when
he stood for the Senate were Mat Reid,
a juvenile vegetarian, aged 68, who had
been boss of the Brisbane Trades Hall
and turned against Labor on war issues,
and Harry Foil, fresh from the A.I.F. in
the Middle East. All who went through
it remember that fight as the campaign of
their lives Reid stayed in the Senate
until 1935, when he retired still full of life
and vigor at the age of 86. Crawford
retired unbeaten in June, 1947, in ill
health and the shadow of his former self,
and Foil was somewhat ungratefully
dropped by his Queensland supporters
at the 1946 elections. S. M. Bruce had
a high opinion of Crawford’s administra-
tive ability and had him in his Ministries
from 1923-25, his main job being that
of “trouble-shooter” and manager of
difficult situations arising in administra-
tion.
Into the Silence:
At Young (N.S.W.), at 100, George Spencer
Whiteman. Born at Camden, he had lived in
Young for 60 years and was at one time Mayor
of the town.
In Sydney, Tal Ordell, radio story-spinner
and before that a well-known stage identity.
He toured Australia with Marie Tempest’s
company and was Ginger Mick in the stage
version of “The Sentimental Bloke.” He also
played in a number of films, his best-
remembered role being Dave in. “On Our Selec-
tion.”
In Perth, at 81, Edmund Shelley Barker,
chairman of Swan Brewery and former manager
of West Australian Trustee, Executor and
Agency Co., which he founded in 1892, two
years after he arrived in Perth from Scotland.
In Brisbane, at 80, R. M. Gow, founder of
a firm of wholesale merchants and manufac-
turers of foodstuffs. Ex-president of the Cham-
ber of Commerce and Constitutional Club,
Foundation Councillor of the Institute of Public
Affairs, he was responsible for the first cargo
of wheat from Queensland to England. He
played championship tennis, inter-State Rugby
Union, held many Queensland championships
for bowls, and was a keen golfer.
In Salisbury, England, Dr. H. C. Taylor
Young, formerly well-known on Macquarie-
street and in Grafton (N.S.W.). He served in
the First World War, and while in Sydney was
an active member of the Highland Society. For
some years he had lived in Switzerland.
In Melbourne, at 91, William Haslam Edgar,
“Father” of the Vic. Legislative Council. He
represented the old Melbourne West Province
and later East Yarra Province for 44 years and
was Chairman of Committees for 26 years. A
pillar of the Methodist Church, he was a draper
and, later, an estate-agent.
In Sydney, at 74, Robert James Napier
Franki, co-founder and a director of Warbur-
ton Franki, Ltd., electrical and mechanical
engineers. One of Sydney’s leading consulting
engineers, his advice was sought by councils
all over New South Wales in connection with
installation of electricity in country towns.

"AND IT'S PRINTED
WITH WIMBLES INKS."
“Becks”: So Chicago “Tribune” artists
have adopted the figure of a little pig as
a symbol of Henry Wallace’s third party
(B. 9/6/’4B). The donkey and the
elephant as emblems of Democrats and
Republicans are part of the stock-in-trade
of all American cartoonists. The donkey
is the older of the two ; its history goes
a long way back, but it was almost dead
from neglect when Thomas Nast came
along about 60 years ago and revived it
in “Harper’s Weekly,” at the same time
inventing the Republican elephant. Nast
also created the Tammany Tiger, now
dead with Tammany. I doubt whether
the Wallace pig will last as long. Aus-
tralian black-and-white men are handi-
capped by the lack of easily recognisable
symbols. We have, for instance, no Aus-
tralian figure corresponding to John Bull
and Uncle Sam ; half-a-century ago Hop
created The Little Boy from Manly and
used him to symbolise sometimes New
South Wales, sometimes Australia. But the
Little Boy could not truly symbolise Aus-
tralia, and he did not long survive Federa-
tion, though Norman Lindsay did employ
his equivalent in the 1914 “War God”
cartoon. Nor are there any universally
accepted figures for the Liberal, Labor
and Country parties; artists have to
make-do with likenesses of the leaders of
the day. I suggest it is time Australian
artists got together and agreed upon
symbols that would not be the property
of one cartoonist but part of the
common stock-in-trade of the craft.

“Hamer”: A columnist says that the
mere thought of a cold shower these
days makes him shiver. The best way
is not to think of it. Just go into the
bathroom thinking about what you will
do with the lottery prize when you win
it, or that Alsoran will probably win at
20-to-l on Saturday; wrapped in your
warm thoughts you will hardly notice the
removal of your clothes. Then turn on
the shower and, taking yourself by the
scruff of the neck, hurl yourself under
the running water. It’s all over in a
minute and you are a better man for it.
I have been recommending this method
for years and one of these days I in-
tend to try it myself.

“Frijole Biter”: My paper told me that,
according to himself, the Dominican
Consul-General made “some pleasantry”
about dogs to the wife of the Argentine
Ambassador in Ottawa, whereupon the
Senora gave what the Dominican took
to be an “offensive answer.” Later, the
Argentine didn’t invite the Dominican
to a party, so the D. challenged the A.
to a duel. It intrigues me, since I’m re-
minded of the Frenchman who appeared
in London with a black eye, mourning
the “barbaric and incomprehensible Eng-
lish tongue.” He went to a London card-
party and was astonished to hear a winner
called a “lucky dog.” However, it was
explained to him that in England the
term was not an insult. A fortnight later
he, determined to be as English as pos-
sible, congratulated a lady winner at a
bridge-party in the same manner, and
naturally used the female gender. Hence
the black eye.

“Horseless Horseman”; The phenome-
non of calm water in all weathers at ex-
posed Cape Jaffa, the site for South Aus-
tralia’s new port (B. 26/5/’4B), recalls
that this occurrence is one of the mari-
time wonders of the world. Although
the edast from Cape Jaffa north is un-
protected from the seas that sweep from
Africa and the Antarctic Circle, open
boats can ride at anchor there in any
gale. The reason for this has baffled
authorities from the Admiralty who have
come out specially to observe the phe-
nomenon, though contributing factors
are the gradual shelving of the seabed
from 20 miles to seaward, the pre-
sence of wire-weed on the bottom and
underwater currents. At Kingston, 10
miles north of the cape, a wharf has stood
for 80 years, and in bygone days U.K.
wool clippers used to load there in the
bay from lighters.

“F.S.”: Most Australian painters are
very susceptible people. Lately they seem
to have gone barmy on slums. In 25
years of attending art shows I have sur-
veyed millions of gum-trees, but of recent
years I have scarcely seen one. Instead,
"But, constable, I haven t been more than five minutes !”
I have been bored to extinction by brick
slums. I have seen enough bricks in
representation to solve the housing Short-
age. The best thing that can be said
about them is that they look like bricks,
and if real bricks were substituted for
them, as has been done in modernistic
exhibitions in Paris, nobody would know
the difference. This, of course, isn’t art,
but it is interesting as showing how deter-
mined most artists are by fashion. It
used to be gum-trees, a la Streeton; now
it is bricks, d la Drysdale. Because Drys-
dale once painted a brick slum and was
praised by the critics no artist can now
paint a picture and leave the bricks out
—and they must be slum bricks. As a
Bulletin critic said, Drysdale can make
a slum even out of a paddock. It is
frightfully boring, and the reason it is
boring is not,because of the slums but
because of the poor quality of the paint-
ing of these brick-artists. Turner painted
lots of slums, and his Battersea land-
scapes are concerned with some of the
worst slums in the Empire. But his pic-
tures are not boring.

“Plop”: I admit our bath-heater was
overlooked in Lempriere’s Classical Dic-
tionary, but nevertheless it is very, very
old, cranky, and caked with its green
patina of the ages. Recently I intro-
duced an overnight guest to it and began
to explain its workings. I should have
known better, for this guest was an “ex-
pert”—during the course of dinner he
had told me how to rearrange my house-
lights, what to put on my books to prevent
mildew, and how to get the scorch-marks
off my suit. He waved me away, claim-
ing that he had never seen such a simple
gas-circuit, so I left him to it and resumed
my possie by the fire. He whistled for a
while and I heard the creak the heater
gives when someone turns the gas on.
Then it blew up. I found him sitting in
the middle of the floor, spattered with
verdigris. His patronising air had vanished
with his eyebrows and the heater was
fatally injured, but not in vain, for the
expert shakily announced: “The whole
trouble was that the left-hand split-pin
centrifugal screw had loosened in its cam-
socket —I think.” It was the first time
I had ever heard him express a state-
ment qualified by any doubt, so I knew
he was on the way to being cured.

“Findy”: My tram-ticket story (B.
9/6/’4B). Homeward bound on the last
tram Adelaide’s “lasts]’ leave at 11.30
p.m. with the laudable intention of get-
ting everyone home by midnight—and
anticipating my waiting cot, I was dozing
peacefully in a corner. “Tickets,” a
raucous voice crashed in on my slumbers,
and I opened my eyes to see an in-
spector standing beside me. I groped in
a pocket and handed him a ticket.' He
compared it with his numbered list.
“That’s an old one,” he growled. So was
the next one I pulled out, and the next.
I gave up turning out my pockets and
started prospecting among the tickets on
the floor, with a vague idea that even
if my own two-penn’orth wasn’t there I
would sooner or later strike a number
that would satisfy him. There wasn’t a
prizewinner among the first half-dozen,
and the inspector's glare changed to a
gleam of triumph as he prepared to add
my name to his fist of victims. The bloke
opposite me could stand it no longer.
He tapped me on the knee and said,
“Excuse me, mate, but haven’t you got
a, monthly pass?” “Hell, yes,” I said as
my head cleared. I pulled out the for-
gotten pass, the inspector gave it a sear-
ing glance that almost scorched the print
off the pasteboard and walked away mut-
tering. I don’t know whom he hated most
at that moment —me or the Good Samari-
tan who rescued me from hia clutches.

“Bosco”: Adelaide’s tram service is
like a woman’s operation—always coming
up for discussion. In letters to the press
motormen and conductors are regularly
assailed and equally often praised.
Fares are always fair game for
the critics, and when recently the fare
went up to a threepenny minimum the
response was immediate, persistent and
vehement. Now the Lord Mayor has
inadvertently had himself reported as
saying that the time-table under which
the last trams leave at 11.30 p.m.
was typical of the people, and asks,
“What respectable person woulcf be
travelling after 11.30?” Even his cheer-
ful, phlegmatic calm should be punc-
tured by the reports “respectable people”
have made through the paper.

“Exdig”: The man who is most senti-
mental about home is usually the nomad
who won’t stay in it when he has one;
but I did think an old cobber of the
First War days in France to whom I
helped to say the last farewell recently
might have been an exception to the
rule. He was always talking “Home,”
and in sing-songs he would sing with
■ nostalgic tears in his eyes lyrics that re-
membered the roses round the door, the
fire in the hearth, and other appurten-
ances of the home ballad. So, when, at
the obsequies, I met his wife and his old
mother, a remark that I had always re-
garded the deceased as a good homebird
seemed right. His wife told me that he
seldom spent more than one night a week
at home, and his mother declared that
even from his toddling days he was a
constant anxiety owing to his fancy for
sleeping in other people’s houses or even
in stables rather than his own bed, until,
when he was in his ’teens, he ran away
for good. The earbashings about home
I had endured from him in France had
only been the ebullitions of a chap who
regards home merely as a place to e
sentimental about from a distance.

“Clooter”: According to Sir John
Latham I am fast going “entertainment
mad” because of the number of times 1
listen to my radio or go to the local
talkies. His Honor didn’t name me speci-
fically but Australians generally when he
laid the charge before a Melbourne con-
ference of librarians, and he went on to
remark that most of the books we read
are “rubbish and trash,” whereas, accord-
ing to Russian statistics, of the 100,000
books published in the Soviet each year
since 1938 only about 4 p.c. were “enter-
tainment.” Which seems to infer that
Australians are a long way behind the
Russians. It’s an unfortunate comparison,
since the Russian reads only the books
which his masters permit him to read,
while we can range at will from the
lightest whodunit to Shakspeare or the
Bible without consulting anybody. Up
to a point Sir John is right, especially
on the radio and talkies; all the same
there is again the same freedom about it,
and though I’ll admit that far too much
radio, screen and printed stuff is trash,
the fact remains that I’m not forced to
take it, and I’m all for freedom of choice
plus rubbish as against compulsion with-
out choice. In the past few years Aus-
tralians have been literally snowed under
with official prints and radio talks and had
their national Parliament broadcast.
Imagine being compelled to absorb all
that stuff under the watchful eye of State
officials! No wonder the Russian has
lost his capacity for laughter—except
cruel laughter.

“Kelms”: In Perth a householder
sought an injunction restraining his
neighbor from using his tennis-court at
night, and claimed damages on account
of the glaring lights and the noise from
which night tennis seems inseparable. He
said it occurred six nights a week; his
neighbor said two. The Judge said prob-
ably four, gave the plaintiff a fiver
damages and told the owner not to use
the court between sunset and 7 a.m. In
addition, players are not to fox balls on
the plaintiff’s property.

“Brolga”: No doubt London-type
taxis may be a success in Sydney’s
traffic, but I doubt the desirability of one
advantage claimed for them by an expert
quoted by the Sydney “Sunday Sun.”
He stated that they would be able to turn
in Pitt-street without backing, even if that
narrow thoroughfare was lined on both
sides with parked cars. I still have
scrambled memories of the time I tried
to turn in Pitt-street and go against the
one-way traffic.

“Nakh”: If Inspector-General What-
more has anything to do with the matter,
prisoners in Victorian jails will not be
allowed to have access to the public ear
per wireless after the example of the Goul-
burn (N.S.W.) jail inmates who recently
broadcast a concert over Sydney and
country radio-stations. He said that, al-
though one long-term man recently
gained highest honors in accountancy,
he did not know of any outstand-
ing musicians, singers or composers in
local prisons. An early inmate of
Pentridge was responsible for one
of the best examples of public
sculpture in Melbourne. He was
a young man lagged for assault and rob-
bery, and the governor noticed he was
skilled at carving. He was commissioned
to execute the fountain with the beauti-
fully modelled boy above it which stands
alongside the Adam Lindsay Gordon
statue by Paul Montfort in Spring-street.
It is a much less academic work than its
neighbor and has a quality conspicuously
lacking in the rest of the city’s sculpture.
The author got a remission of his
sentence, but, sad to relate, his artistic
bent didn’t keep him long on the path of
virtue.

“Wildo”: Theatre-ticket queues?
About 25 years ago I determined to get
good seats for Toti Dal Monte. I arrived
before daylight and was pleased to be
first in line. I soon had company when
the police-patrol arrived. Then I
was for it. What was I doing there
and wasn’t I trying the door-lock?
Where did I live and what was my
name? After some time I was satisfied
I had convinced them that I was respect-
able and the resident officer of a Collins-
street bank. The patrol was not so satis-
fied ; it was back in a few minutes to see
if I had started anything. After being
told to stand back from the door I was
left in peace. When you queue-up don’t
envy the first in line; in all probability
he has earned that position by going
through the third-degree.
COURT DRESS.
“The question of whether aldermen should wear
Court dress at official functions during the Royal
visit next year is agitating City Councils in all
State capitals.”
Coming events, you hardly need reminding,
Their shadows far ahead are apt to throw,
Sometimes a month, sometimes a year. No
binding
Rule can be quoted about this, you know.
Lord Mayors already are engaged in finding
What sort of clobber will be comme il jemt
When Royalty, with attendant retinues,
Arrives to grace municipal shivoos.
Court dress, albeit admittedly de rigueur,
Is tough on citizens of ample girth
Who ply their knives and forks with vim and
vigor,
And, if they haven’t got it, where on earth
Is it obtainable, and at what figure?
You hear them ask, from Brisbane round to
Perth,
The chaps who rest on cushioned chairs their
rumps
And grip the handles of our parish pumps.
Court dress! How few of those who fain would
render
Their rightful dues to gracious Majesties,
Symbols' of sovereignty of either gender
Who’re coming to us from across the seas,
Have ever basked in the sartorial splendor
Of pants that terminate below the knees,
And every other frill therewith that goes
From silver-buckled shoon to silken hose!
All well for belles and beaux whose thoughts
are turning
To what stern fashion’s arbiters allow
As needful in a curtsy, or who’re learning
The way to make a ceremonious bow
To Royalties, but spare a thought concerning
Bumbles who’ve no Court dress and know
not how
Or where to find a snip in days like these
To meet their obvious deficiencies.

“Bamekaw”: As one of the big fellows
who would be penalised by “Findy’s”
sliding-scale for suits (B. 2/6/’4B), I must
get in early with my protest. Any advan-
tage the O.S. chap may get from inches or
poundage is cancelled in many ways. If
half of one of those tram- or bus-seats
allegedly built for two is vacant I must
let it go to some skinnier bloke, as it is
easier to stand than perilously overhang
the passage, meanwhile getting violent
cramps in the leg used as a stabiliser.
Seats in picture-shows and concert-halls
do not allow for the long fellow; no
crossing of the legs is possible, and the
only way to get a little comfort is to
sit on the end and sprawl one’s legs out
in the aisle for latecomers to trip over.
Also the big fellow is a mark for {a)
those who hurl witticisms at his bulk,
trading on his good nature to take them
amicably, and ( b ) the half-baked jiu-jitsu
expert who wishes to demonstrate that
“the bigger they are, the heavier , they
fall,” And how often have you seen a
little drunk pester a big man, knowing
he is safe? If his belligerence is tolerated
he can boast of scaring someone twice his
size, and if he gets a well-earned thump
on the ear he can always turn public
feeling against the other for hitting some-
one smaller than himself. Yes, it’s a
hard world for genial giants.

“Zake”: Of all military men Jan
Christiaan Smuts must surely be the, most
deserving of the world’s sympathy—less
because of his being a victim of the poli-
tical wheel’s turn than of the perpetual
uncertainty that must be his as to his true
rank. Just before the South African
elections my morning paper confidently
accorded him full generalship. My after-
noon paper blithely promoted him to
field-marshal, but the A.B.C. a few hours
later, apparently dissatisfied with his
handling of politico-military affairs, de-
"My fool of a husband's been trying to fix it for hours."
moted him to general. The general—no,
field-marshal—no, dammit, general—
enjoyed only two more demotions and
restorations until last week, when he
invited further pay cuts and rises by mak-
ing a speech at Cambridge University.
While reading my morning paper’s report
of General Smuts’s warning on Soviet
ambitions I switched on the radio, to
near that Field-Marshal Smuts had made
a speech warning against Soviet, etc.
Holding down two such high military jobs
simultaneously no doubt has its ad-
vantages, but one thing has me puzzled:
Does his dingbat, to save constantly
changing them or in deference to our
radio and daily press, put both crossed
swords and crossed batons on the old
gentleman’s tunic?

“Ex-C.G.”: Melbourne is faced with a
catastrophe beside which a wet Cup Day

of meat-pies may have to cease for lack
of suitable meat. Pause, ere you laugh
thp thing is really serious. A pieless Aus-
tralian city is a far worse thing to con-
template than a gasless one. What would
the office flappers of both sexes do for
lunch? Where would the harried clerk
go between 1 p.m. and 2 p.m.? What
of the woman-shopper shoving into the
ragshop cafeteria and being compelled to
eat fish or curried chops? To me, who
revelled in other days with a meat-pie
and pot o’ beer in the old Royal Mail,
at Hosie’s and Young and Jackson’s, the
sign “No Pies” is a more dread vision
than the familiar “No Beer,” And the
prospect of rushing from a Victorian
train at Murtoa, Maryborough, Wan-
garatta or any other “refreshment”
station and not being able to yell “Pie
an’ tea” is enough to empty every pas-
senger train in the Cabbage Garden. Be-
sides, what are the makers of tomato-
sauce to do?

“Kelms”: News that a British inventor
has been awarded £125,000 may stimu-
late a friend of mine to continue an
experiment that was interrupted by an
M.O, in a p.-0.-w. camp in Bavaria. This
chap developed a rash on his leg and, in
the absence of ointment, applied a poul-
tice of melted cheese —Argentine make,
tinned, and as high as a Cabinet Minister’s
self-esteem. When he removed it the
hairs came with it —painlessly—and when
they showed no signs of regrowth an
awed look came into his eyes. “Pve got
it,” he exulted. “The perfect no-razor
shave-cream.” He applied some to his
face and within a few minutes was clean-
shaven. The facial growth didn’t re-
appear, either, but within a week that
chap had the most painful and heaviest
crop of pimples the quack had ever seen.
It took six tnonths to cure him, and by
that time he’d acquired an aversion to
all things Argentine. But inventors are
hard to discourage, and £125,000 is a lot
of money.

“Hoop”; When a Sydney daily
carried a photograph of a horse being
petted by a girl and immortalised as yet
another “well-known character” I reached
for my doorstopping Webster to see just
what was meant by it. The big book
pegs the colloquial “character” as “a
unique or extraordinary individual,” and
thereby makes a fibber of the paper’s cap-
tion-writer, for it would be hard to find a
newspaper shot of a stationary horse that
isn’t being petted by a girl, and, by the
number of “well-known characters” who
daily inhabit the columnist corners, Syd-
ney must be bulging with unique or ex-
traordinary individuals.

“High Tide”: Those red-hot needle-
like pains experienced by “Shot Line”
(B. 7/4/’4B) during his first six-fathom
practice dive were more likely psycho-
logical or due to some inherent ear
defect than to an increase of pressure
within the dress resulting from a stumble
in a hole in Sydney Harbor. The air
pumped to a diver is at a pressure of
approximately lib. for every 2ft. of depth
at which he is operating—just enough to
balance the pressure he is subjected to
by the water. In breathing the
compressed-air, the diver uses up the
oxygen, but the nitrogen—or most of it —
dissolves in his bloodstream and tissues.
If the diver rose suddenly from consider-
able depth the dissolved nitrogen would
burst through his bloodstream and tissues
in the form of bubbles. The result at
best would be acute pains in all muscles
and joints, fainting and at worst per-
manent paralysis. That’s why it takes
nearly four hours to surface a diver from,
say, 200 ft. depth. He has to be rested
for increasing periods for decompression
“How about a rest? This frame's dashed heavy!”
as he approaches the surface to get the
dissolved nitrogen out of his bloodstream
and tissues,

“X.S.”: Gaming police in Melbourne,
solicitous of the public welfare, have
issued a double warning, on the one hand
to punters with winnings not to join
“mushroom” two-up “schools” after leav-
ing the racecourses lest they fall into the
clutches of owners of slotted kips and
double-headed pennies, and on the other
to said owners that the use of such un-
patriotic apparatus renders the user liable
to be kicked to death if found out. A
slotted kip (a lannet) usually has two
genuine pennies placed on top of it with
a double-header (a Jack) inserted in the
slot. When the coins are tossed the spin-
ner palms one of the pennies and, with
a deft twist of the lannet, allows the jack
to spin in the air. Sergeant Murphy,

a man who used a similar kip at North
Melbourne was shot in the stomach.

“Dong”: Screen advertising has come
a long way since the old-time hand-
written slides that bore messages
like: “Buy your veal from Harry Seale,
Sausages a specialty.” These days it has
developed into a “pick the product”
puzzle, A typical scene might be in a
night-club with a couple sitting at a table,
the woman frowning. You haven’t a clue
what is coming next. The uninitiated
probably think that her feet are hurting ;
educated filmgoers know there is more
to it. She has a headache and should be
taking some brand of aspirin. She is
tired out because she used an “old-
fashioned bar soap” to do her weekly
washing—or because she didn’t. Maybe
she’s not getting enough sleep and should
invest in a “Springo” coiled-coil mattress.
She might have eyestrain because the
light-bulbs in her house are inferior. You
are on tenterhooks. Finally she leans
across the table to her husband and
speaks: “You know, Kevin, I’d feel like
dancing out' there with the others, but
these days I have no energy.” “That’s
strange,” says Kevin ; “it’s the same with
me.” The lady continues: “Well, Jean
told me yesterday just what the trouble
is. We’re suffering from a protein defici-
ency because of the poor-quality meat we
buy. Tomorrow I’m going straight to
Harry Seale.”

“Matros”: One invention urgently
needing perfecting in Australia is a news-
paper-rolling machine. During the last
few years several machines have been
patented, but as yet there is not one on
the market. Thousands of newsagents
throughout the Commonwealth spend
weary hours folding or rolling millions of
papers daily. Those of us who start
rolling the morning papers for delivery
long before dawn are anxiously waiting
further developments.

“Mr.”; Those two theories regarding
Helen Keller’s reaction to the photo-
grapher’s flash-bulb (B. 19/5/’4B and
2/6/’4B) sound feasible enough, but I
have another. As the eye is merely an
enlarged nerve-end, carried to its present
stage of development by evolution
through the ages, two French experi-
menters reasoned that if they were to
direct a powerful light at a section of the
skin where an important nerve termi-
nated it would be only a matter of per-
sistent application to make that nerve,
in a blind person, capable of registering
and conveying to the brain its reaction to
light. Just before the war they were
claiming an encouraging measure of
success. It’s my guess that Helen Keller’s
reaction to that flash-bulb had to do with
the amazing sensitivity of her skin to
light.
“Laetitia”: Almost as intriguing as the
designs with which our birdmen adorned
their kites were the mottoes. Sheer im-
pudence was the most popular motif in
the slogans, hence the spate of tags like
"Deadeye Dick,” “One-shot Mulligan”
and “Halitosis.” My favorite was the
caption emblazoned all over the port
and starboard fuselage of a Kittyhawk at
Milne Bay in 1942. In huge capitals the
slogan ran “I FEAR NOBODY” ; then
in tiny characters, tailing away to invisi-
bility, was the word “m-m-m-m-m-uch.”
The shy young pilot hurried to explain
that he had borrowed the motto, with
permission, from the C.O. of a R.A.F.
Spitfire Squadron in England—apparently
in such matters there was a strict code
to be observed.
* * * ♦
“Muskeen”: Those dummy boxes of
chocolates (B. 28/4/’4B). I had just dis-
embarked from the Middle East at
Fremantle in 1942. Lured by an attractive
window-display of sweets, I asked for
a box, only to be greeted with a snigger
ing “I s’pose'you know there’s a war on.”
Nothing could have made me feel more
at home.
* * * *
“Bungle”: Apparently it’s the latest in
advertising. The script becomes verbal
with Billy wanting something, “I wanna
ride,” he bellows —or a balloon, or a
battleship. It matters not what he wants
—the crux of the thing is that Billy must
be immediately sidetracked and soothed
by the bestowal on him of two bars of
the advertised sweet. After which there
is a fadeout on the note of delighted
murmurings by Billy, My reactions to the
set-up were (1) never to buy that par-
ticular sweet, and (2) (taking note of a
calculating gleam in the eye of my listen-
ing Hopeful) to place in a handy and
most obvious place my discarded razor-
strop.

“Waddlin’ Willie”: Old Diggers living
in the Victorian Housing Commission’s
new Ashburton Estate, just out of Mel-
bourne, will have little opportunity of
forgetting the Middle East. The new
railway station has been named Alamein.

“Blue P,”: I was deeply moved by the
plight of an Englishman named Hugo
Daniels who, under the will of his
brother-in-law, was left £30,000, payable
in six-monthly instalments of £lOOO.
Hugo protested that his benefactor did it
that way because he had the instincts of
a dictator and yearned to control people.
“I can’t do what I like with it,” he com-
plained, meaning the principal sum. I
wept with him until I learned that he was
83 and began wondering what he would
have done with it anyhow,
* * * *
“Blackout”: Stage fights aren’t always
failures (B. 14/4/’4B). Oscar Asche and
Gerald Kay Souper, both experts with
the foils, made such a success of their
duel in “Count Hannibal” at Her
Majesty’s, Sydney, that one evening Asche
actually pinked Souper, who finished the
show with his wrist bandaged,
* * * *
“Pat”: Having at last got a house —after
three years’ hunting—we were obliged to
wait for workmen to do plastering, paint-
ing and other odd jobs, including the
replacing of a fuel copper by a gas one.
One morning I found the old fuel copper
had been demolished, but the “head man”
informed me that a gas replacement
wouldn’t be available for five or six
weeks. “Why did you knock out the
fuel copper, then?” I asked. “Well, it
wouldn’t have been any good to you,”
he pointed out. “You haven’t any wood.”
THE ROAD TO FAME.
“Christian Dior, creator of the most spectacular
fashion in a quarter of a century—the so-called New
Look” —is a shy Parisian bachelor of 46, pleased jet
modestly surprised at his own success. News ite .
Some men are bom to fame, but more achieve it
By ways and inodes too numerous to ten,
Inventions and ideas which —believe it
Or not —you’d hardly reckon possible.^
They range from leading armies and designing
New means for mastery of the sea and air,
And curing fell diseases, to divining
What women want to wear.
Some win to eminence and fill their purses,
A feat as dear to most of Adam s sons,
By writing stacks of memorable verses.
And rather more by scoring stacks of runs.
So many avenues there are to glory,
So many pathways to celebrity,
Each may explore his own one suo more,
Including you and me.
And now, fruit of one more outsize invention,
Another name across the world is borne
To be acclaimed with honorable mention
From the lone Orkneys to the storm-tossed
Horn.
Here’s to the very latest beautifier
Of female frames, from Frisco to Japan!_
Come, drink a toast with me to Christian Dior,
The shy Parisian.
By subfile artistry and rare acumen
He rose the envied title to annex
Of fashion’s benefactor to the human
Species—or anyhow the distaff sex.
Some gratitude to others may be owing
For making Parliamentary votes their biz,
But they should ne’er forget that the bestowing
Of the “New Look” was his.

To give policyholders and the public—
there are no shareholders—a clearer and
crisper picture of the business, the City
Mutual has abandoned the old standard-
ised form of presenting assurance
accounts and adopted the modern ver-
tical, or single-sided, method, with “run-
as-you-read” headings. The manage-
ment is to be congratulated on the
change, which is the first of its kind in
the assurance field in Australia. It is a
definite step away from obscurantism
and indigestibility (the two main objec-
tions to the old form of presenting the
figures) and toward clearer and more in-
formative accounts, in which the elements
depicting progress and strength are de-
lineated with greater precision and in
logical sequence, thus making for ease in
reading and understanding a type of
accounts the implications of which are
not always readily grasped.
In common with other life offices, the
co.’s story last year is one of marked
progress. Activities are confined to the
Commonwealth, and no industrial con-
tracts are written. New business and total
income 'both reached record levels; the
surplus available for distribution substan-
tially increased ; most policyholders got
slightly increased rates of bonuses; there
was a satisfactory margin between the
assumed and actual rate of interest
earned; sale of some assets realised
£226,278 more than their book value ; a
large amount was added to reserves
(apart from actuarial liabilities); and the
already sound financial structure was
further strengthened. Still, cheap money,
high taxation, inflation and a restricted
field of investment are an unholy com-
bination for a life office. They have not
only bitten deeply into pre-war bonus
rates, but also stand in the way of restora-
tion of these rates to their old levels.
New business put on the books
(£5,574,129, up £794,228) was more than
double the 1939 figure, and the average
per policy (now £571) has increased by
more than 52 p.c. over the same period.
Inflation, which has had the effect of
lowering an assured’s life cover; the
growing popularity of subsidised staff
superannuation schemes, which has
bumped up the proportion of endowment
assurance; and “full” employment, high
wages and scarcities are the chief factors
responsible for the leap in the figures.
The year’s income, where it came from,
the amount absorbed in outgoings and
charges, and the resulting surplus com-
pare as follows:
Income — 1946. 1947.
Premiums, etc £1,366,469 £1,511,638

Total £1,721,268 £1,795,355
Surplus 350,672 549,844
* Includes taxes, depreciation and contribution to
staff fund.
Owing to the large amount of new busi-
ness and continued rise in costs gener-
ally, too much notice need not be taken
of the growth in exes. Excluding taxes
(£61,717) and depreciation (£28,485), exes,
took 13.2 p.c. of total income (less non-
recurring items) as against 12 p.c. in the
previous year.
Together with £20,854 brought for-
ward, the surplus was dealt with in this
way;
1946. 1947.

To write down assets .. 10,000 26,278
To carry forward .. .. 20,854 24,357
The year’s bonus additions (£285,063),
together with the growth in actuarial
liability (£652,958), lifted the actuarial
reserve to £15,091,188. This reserve,
calculated on a net premium basis
with interest at 2\ p.c., is the amount
necessary to meet future claims as they
arise. It has the support and assistance
of £724,357 of other reserves, up £200,000-
odd last year. The reason for putting
such large amounts in the cupboard, in-
stead of distributing them as bonuses, is
mainly to protect future bonus-paying
capacity against the effects of cheap
money and inflation.
The net effective rate of interest earned
last year (after deducting rates and taxes)
was £3 16s. p.c. (down 3s. 6d. p.c.) on
the mean actuarial reserve. There is thus
a margin of 1.3 p.c. above the assumed
rate, whereas 1 p.c. is usually considered
adequate for maintenance of existing com-
pound reversionary bonus rates.
The actuarial and other reserves, to-
gether with £474,764 of sundry liabilities
(largely claims in course of settlement)
were held in this form:
1946. p.c. 1947. p.c.
Govt, securities £9,902,799 65.6 £10,961,155 67.5
Mortgages, etc. 1,581,162 10.4 1,557,939 9.6

'Cash and sundries 152,166 1.0 202,405 1.2
The year’s growth in total assets was
£1,182,732, of which £1,058,356 was
channelled into low-interest-bearing Gov-
ernment securities, which now account for
67.5 p.c. of the balance-street total as
against 23.2 p.c. at end 1939.

* Pref. div. arrears (now £113,212) included in
deficit until 1945.
Formed in November, 1915, to take over
the old Q.M.E.’s cattle runs in the far-
west and nor’-west of Queensland, where
rains are uncertain and the beasts slow-
maturing and a long way from treatment
works, this co. paid a run of divs. aver-
aging 8.4 p.c. over the next five years.
No ord. div. has been paid since. And
at end November last payments to the
prefs. were £113,212 in arrears, while
£111,721 of the £325,579 of capital was
represented by a p. and 1. debit. Capi-
tal is in 107,249 8 p.c. cum. prefs. and
218,330 ords., all of £1 each. The prefs.,
put out in 1923, received their 8 p.c. for
each of the first three years, nothing for
the next 14 years and then a regular 6.2
p.c., except in 1946, when they were
passed by again—the rate was reduced to
the lower figure under the Queensland
Mortgagors’ and Other Persons’ Relief
Act.
During the ipid-1930’s it was proposed
to write off the whole of the ord. capital
(then unrepresented by tangibles in the
books), cancel arrears of pref. divs., con-
vert the existing prefs. into ords., and
issue £70,000 of new 5 p.c. prefs. in satis-
faction of a debt to the Q.M.E. The
co.’s memorandum, however, stood in
the way of sanction by the Court.
Meanwhile, a run of better seasons, and
then war and assured markets at good
prices, enabled the co. to show annual
profits for 11 out of the last dozen
years. The exception was 1946, when a
loss of £14,587 showed up, owing to the
Queensland meat strike. The average
net return for the dozen years was
£14,568, enough to pay the prefs. 6.2 p.c.
and show 3.6 p.c. on ord. capital. But the
co. had been forced to lean heavily upon
outsiders during the bad years; so, after
payment of pref. divs., the balance of
earnings was used to reduce the debt,
which has been worked down from
£206,996 in 1933 to £53,760 at close of
last accounts. Among other things, it
all demonstrates the unwisdom of en-
tirely eliminating the equity of ordinary
shareholders in a business, no matter how
hopeless the position might appear.
As the board sees the position at the
moment —and the co.’s history suggests
that the view is not a pessimistic one —
there is little prospect of cleaning the
pref. slate and paying an ord. div. inside
about 20 years. So, to give the ords. a
chance of coming into the picture at an
early date, they will be asked, on lune 29,
to (1) write off 10s. of each £1 share, and
then (2) transfer one-third of their hold-
ing of 10s. shares to those on the pref.
register. In return the prefs. will be asked
to cancel arrears of pref. divs. (£113,212)
tq end November, 1947. At that date
86,288 of the pref. shares were* held by
persons whose name also appeared on
the ord. register.
If adopted, the proposal will reduce
paid capital to £216,414 in 107,249 £1
8 p.c. cum. prefs. (reduced to 6.2 p.c.
under the Act already referred to) and
218,330 ords. of 10s. each. On that lot,
average net earnings over the last 12 years
would show 7.3 p.c. on ord. capital, after
payment of 6.2 p.c. to the prefs. On the
basis of market bids (3s. 6d. a share) for
the ords. before announcement of the
board’s proposals, and assuming payment
of a 4 p.c. div. to the ords., the holder of,
say, 99 prefs. could see an immediate
capital gain of £l7 6s. 6d., plus a lift of
approx. £2 in dividend receipts, making a
total of 8.2 p.c, on the face value of his
pref. holding alone, with prospects of
further improvement in the market price
of both classes of shares. A month ago
245. 9d. was offered for the prefs.
The £109,165 of capital to be written
off is to be used to rub-out, or nearly rub-
out, the p. and 1. debit of £111,721. Out-
side liabilities and the book value of
tangible assets will remain unchanged:
1939. 1945. 1946. 1947.

An independent valuation of assets at
the close of accounts showed an excess
of £176,594 over book values, mainly on
account of livestock, which the board
rightly takes into the books on a con-
tinuing-to-trade, not immediate market-
value, basis.
The co. owns four big leasehold
properties, but doesn’t say upon what
terms and conditions, or when the leases
run out. Last year’s profit was below
average, owing to seasonal conditions,
which also resulted in decreased brand-
ings. The situation in Britain and the
dollar position promise an assured market
for Australian beef for some years ahead.
Meanwhile, seasons and costs look like
the biggest problems growers will have to
contend with.

Once again shareholders of York Motors
(Holding) can estimate pretty accurately
their net profit for the term which has
still six months to run. Of the £159,335
earned by the subsidiary last year all
but the odd £335 has, since the close of
accounts, been transferred as dividends
to the holding co. —constituting the
latter’s gross profit for the year ending
next November. Of this sum (nearly
treble the previous figure) the board says
£lOO,OOO will be packed away in reserves.
Allowing for administrative expenses,
something like £55,000 should remain as
disposable profit, but the precise amount
to be distributed among shareholders
depends on the board’s estimate of the
trading outlook in November.
The foregoing table covers the full
career of the holding co. since it acquired
the seven-year-old York Motors Pty.,
Ltd., in 1939, paying £6 for each of the
52,000 £1 shares. Soon afterwards
vehicle imports were affected by the war,
but York was not only quick to adopt
temporary expedients, it repeatedly signed
up new permanent members for its team
of distributing agencies. Thus it has
emerged from the war with an exception-
ally wide repertoire: besides the original
N. S. Wales franchises for Chrysler and
Morris cars, it distributes Singers, Stude-
bakers, Willy's, Rolls-Royces and Bent-
leys, as well as Dennis, Fargo and Mack
trucks and Howard tractors. In Queens-

Whilst shareholders have had no reason
to complain about their receipts, visible

Imported chassis are still piled up await-

first time stocks are shown after deduc-
tion of a £50,000 reserve for price fluctu-
ations. To carry the net increase of
£340,267, and £116,307 more debtors’ bal-
ances, the board used shareholders’ funds
and £370,479 extra credits. The liquid
position is now being relieved by an issue
of 88,000 £1 ords. at a 20s. premium.

THE
A.M.P.
SOCIETY
Chairman’s Address at the 99th Annual Meeting
★ ★ ★
Presenting the 99th Annual Report and
Balance Sheet at the Head Office, 87 Pitt
Street, Sydney, on June 4, the Deputy-
Chairman of Directors of the A.M.P.
Society, Sir Frederick H. Tout, gave an
account of the Society’s growth.
New Business, 1947:
“Total sum assured amounted to over
£61,520,000”, said Sir Frederick, “which
was 5% above 1946 figures, an all time
record, and some 40% of the New Busi-
ness written in the Ordinary Department
came from existing policyholders.”
Payments to Policyholders:
During 1947 the Society paid a total of
more than £9,949,000 to policyholders
. . . more than £27,000 daily!
Low Management Expenses:
By care in management, the expenses
rate for 1947 in the Ordinary Department
was reduced to 17.35% as against
18.37% for 1946. The Society has always
had one of the lowest expense rates*
among life offices throughout the world.
Interest Earnings:
In 1946 the rate of interest realised by
the Society was £3/17/5%. The rate
for 1947 being £3/16/3%. At present,
Government authorities could largely in-
fluence the rate of interest earned. There
were obvious advantages to a Govern-
ment, as a borrower, in securing a reduc-
tion in interest rates. On the other hand,
any attempt to fix interest rates at too
low a figure would certainly lead to un-
desirable effects on our economic life.
The investment of savings in Life
Insurance remains, irrespective of interest
rates, the most satisfactory method for
the average citizen to make provision for
his dependents in event of his death,
and at the same time to save for his own
financial security in later years.
Investment of Funds:
The Society’s investment in Preference
and Ordinary Shares increased by over
£1,869,000 and Debentures of Companies
by over £410,000. The holdings in these
investments now stood at £2,052,000 and
£2,063,000 respectively. The Society’s
investment in Government and Semi-
Government Loans was increased by
£8,647,000 during 1947.
Valuation Basis:
The reduction of the Society’s valuation
rate of interest from 3% to had
been carried a further stage. Over 97%
of the Society’s liabilities was now valued
on the more stringent basis.
Bonus to Policyholders:
Bonuses to policyholders in both Depart-
ments would be allotted at the same rate
as for the previous year. The surplus
available for distribution provides re-
versionary bonuses of approximately
£6,000,000 in the Ordinary Department
and £530,000 in the Industrial Depart-
ment.
Staff:
The rapid growth of the Society in recent
years had resulted in a corresponding
increase in the work of the staff, who
at all times had efficiently and willingly
carried out their duties.
Directors:
Owing to indifferent health, Sir Samuel
Hordern resigned from the Board on 6th
August last. The Hon. T. A. J. Playfair,
M.L.C., was appointed to fill the vacancy
and Mr. C. H. Hoskins was elected Chair-
man and Sir Frederick H. Tout Deputy
Chairman. The retiring Directors, Mr. C.
H. Hoskins and the Hon. T. A. J. Play-
fair, M.L.C., had been duly re-elected
at a ballot held on 17th May.
Executive Appointments:
In conclusion, Sir Frederick said that, on
the 31st December, 1947, Mr. S. Osmond
had retired from the position of General
Manager. Mr. M. C. Buttfield succeeded
him, and Mr. L. G. Oxby, F.1.A., had fol-
lowed Mr. Buttfield as Secretary to the
Society,
The Australian Mutual Provident Society
Head Office: 87 Pitt Street, Sydney.
Studebaker imports are now in
the air. It isn’t easy to assess the
prospective demand for U.K.
models, but the post-war rush of
applications hasn’t spent itself
yet. Both the Morris and Austin
manufacturers are establishing
their own body-making units in
Australia to speed up supplies ;
each has increased its chassis
output and introduced improved
models, whilst the cut in export
prices announced by Morris this
year (at an annual profit sacri-
fice of £1 million sterling,
according to Lord Nuffield) is a
further sign of Britain’s deter-
mination to hold its markets.
For the first half of the current
term York reports a sustained
turnover, and another very suc-
cessful result is likely. Com-
petition from the new General
Motors locally-built car will be-
gin to be felt in 1949.
Latest ex-rights price of 535.
for York’s £1 shares offers a
yield of 5.6 p.c. on the basis of
last year’s 15 p.c. div., of which
5 p.c. was labelled bonus. On
the increased capital, a full
year’s div. at that rate would call
for £60,000, and the shares will
have net backing of 255. sd. each
—which allows nothing for the
value of franchises.
Victoria’s principal gold pro-
ducers, and their output in fine
ounces for 1947, are:
Oz. Fine.
A 1 Consolidated (Gaffney’s Ck.) .. 22,808
Morning. Star (Woods Point) .. 11,805
North Deborah (Bendigo) .. 8,910

Outstanding feature of the A 1
mine is- the rich Victory reef,
which has yielded consistently
high-grade ore since it was dis-
covered in 1943. Ore treated by
the co. (paid capital £36,000 in
90,000 10s. shares paid to Bs.
each), yields obtained and divi-
dends paid since the Victory
reef was cut are as follows:
Ore, Gold, Dividends.

The diamond drill is now at
work on No. 16 level (1663 ft.)
in search of what lies ahead.
Morning Star has deepened its
shaft 61ft. below No.- 16 level
(Lancaster floor), and some
high-grade ore over good widths
has been exposed in recent cuts
on the Achilles and Stirling
floors. Average grade of ore
mined last year was 13.3dwt.
For four weeks to March 27 co.
treated 1157 tons for 8640 z. fine
gold, an average of 14.9dwt.
* * * *
“Goldie”: There’s a strong
case for a lift in the Australian
price of gold to £2O an ounce,
especially from the viewpoint of
mining cos. and prospectors. It’s
needed now if the industry is
to exist. Cost of production
has almost doubled since 1939,
without any appreciable rise in
the price of the metal, which is
a valuable commodity ■ that
speaks all languages. At £A2O
an ounce, which is about the
level in Asiatic markets to-
day, continuance of goldmining
at the 1939 level would be
assured. A gold boom isn’t
desirable, and is unlikely to
occur, considering the rise in
price of other commodities and
shortage of manpower. Can-
berra now has the oppor-
tunity of making up the differ-
ence between the present price
and the figure stated, or of pay-
ing dearly for a revival later on,
when the industry has dwindled
to negligible proportions.
* * * ♦
From London: Great Boulder
Prop, dolefully reports that
during the March quarter ton-
nage treated was only 75 p.c.,
and development footage 60 p.c.,
of normal, the contraction being
due to a five-weeks closure of
Edwards shaft for repairs, to
winding engine dislocation re-
sulting from phenomenal floods
in February, and to shortage of
labor. Co. adds that current
throughput is still below normal
because of labor scarcity. A
new lode exposed last August
in the Edwards deep workings
is stated to be looking well. To
date it has been proved for a
length of 150 ft., and averages
S.s"dwt. over a width of 58in.

don concerns the balance. J.

ing director and chairman of

If Chifley Goes
On present public reactions
the Chifley Government is
doomed at the next election,
provided the redistribution of
electorates now being considered
does not achieve the Caucus
objective. And with the passing
of each week the public regard
for this jumped-up, cocksure
crowd of small ability and poor
standards grows lower and lower,
one chicken after another flying
home squawking to the party
roost and embarrassing the entire
Government.
Mr. Chifley is a defiant, stub-
born man, as was shown in his
attempt to blast his way through
public opinion in the matter of
the Bank Grab Act. He is a
bad loser (evident after defeat of
the Prices Referendum) and
faces the public as little as pos-
sible these days— not that he
ever had much of a way with
the people; but his retiring
habits are now regarded as in-
difference more than merely the
kind of life that high office
forces on to a busy man.
For a long time Mr. Chifley
was able to rely on a pet theory
that the people have short
memories in matters political,
and he was encouraged in his
reliance by the manner in which
the Ministry got away with some
outrageous injustices against in-
dividuals, classes and organisa-
tions. But from now on Mr.
Chifley is likely to find that
public memory, so far as the
Canberra “Labor” party is con-
cerned, is long and lively.
Defeat of Canberra “Labor”
would be beneficial in the fact
alone that the A.C.T.U. no longer
dominated Government policy.
And to he relieved from the
“Labor” hangover of war-time
“controls” and socialistic intent
would be something in itself.
Australia has been under a
series of Federal Labor Govern-
ments since October 7, 1941.
Early in 1942 Labor Minister
Ward introduced his new man-
power control and called it “an
instrument of total war,” becom-
ing abusive and threatening to
political opponents almost at
once. He quickly suggested that
the Opposition should be man-
powered, and, when he failed to
ride roughshod over the em-
ployers’ representatives in the
Industrial Relations. Council
(which he himself sabotaged) he
threatened to “fit” them “into
some vital war work.”
So early did “Labor” Minis-
ters begin to show their hands.
Even in midst of a horrible war,
in which Australian nurses were
being brutally slaughtered by
Japanese and captured Austra-
lian soldiers treated barbar-
ously, some cock-a-hoop mem-
bers of the Government were far
more interested in playing the
political game they had been
trained for and preparing for
the day when they could convert
the country to socialism than
they were in the fullest, most
efficient and united prosecution
of the war.
“Labor” introduced a political
—Socialistic —bias to the con-
duct of the war early in the
piece. There was scant con-
sideration "for middle-class
families with sons in the services.
Preference went to militant
trade-unionists, especially trade-
union bosses with Communist
leanings, and political bludgers
and Government hangers-on
multiplied in a manner that is
only now being revealed.
There was never much moral
fibre in “Labor’s” war-time poli-
tical behavior, and little moral
justice in its economic planning.
The A.C.T.U. didn’t like the
idea of conscription for over-
seas service, so the Government
bowed to the A.C.T.U. Pressure
politics likewise dictated the
shape of the Government’s eco-
nomic policy and the- gradations
in its taxation scale. There was
no comparison between the re-
wards of “militant” seamen —
militant only in a political"" sense
• —and those of R.A.N, rank and
file. And the “Government”
acquiesced, if it did not connive,
in the reduction of output per
man-hour and shorter working
week that was the objective of
most of the influential trade-
unions.
These Canberra “Labor” Gov-
ernments have had a rotten
record during and since the war.
There has been too little re-
gard for standards of decent
conduct in high and low places,
a sordid, selfish materialism has
been preached to “Labor” fol-
lowers, and political standards
have been degraded. The efforts
of those hard workers and
thrifty citizens who have played
such a large part in the develop-
ment of this country to its pre-
sent state are ignored or treated
with contempt. It would appear
that Australia and all the work,
faith, enterprise and bloodshed
that have gone into its creation
was to be a political prize for a
crowd of socialistic adventurers
and their followers. But any con-
tribution, by this generation of
“Labor,” of hard work, more
thrift, further creation? Well,
three years after the war we are
still facing the economics of
scarcity.
If Chifley goes it will be a
great thing for Australia to
know that the selfish and ob-
structive A.C.T.U. is no longer
cracking the whip over the
Government of the Common-
wealth —a Government that has
grown greatly in powers and in-
fluence for good or bad since
1939. It will be equally refresh-
ing to realise that the experi-
mental policy of Socialism,
standing in the way of all free
enterprise, will be thrown out.
Whatever other merits they
“Help! I'm being robbed!"
may possess or lack, the present
Opposition parties in Canberra
stand for greater production for
the community benefit under
processes basically related to
free enterprise. And Menzies
has a record of firmness when it
comes to trade-union larrikin-
ism ; it is for this, and no other
reason, that the larrikins have
tagged him with the title “Pig-
iron Bob.” Looking at things in
reverse, it was noticed that the
mere taking of office by Federal
“Labor” in 1941 quickly affected
industrial morale in N, S. Wales,
and probably most other States.
The Liberal and Country
parties are fully aware of the
need for increased production at
lower costs, both to be achieved
by greater efficiency. They are
equally aware of the desirability
of wage-earners receiving the-
highest possible real wage, as
opposed to the paper-money
prosperity of the Chifley Gov-
ernment. The Liberals advo-
cate incentive-payments and
profit-sharing, both opposed by
the A.C.T.U. on the ground
that good-feeling between em-
ployer and wage-earner takes
the latter out of the control of
the trade-union boss.
The Opposition parties stand
for the upholding of the dignity
of the law, and for the rule of
law in industry and elsewhere.
The importance of this is now
being more generally realised
after almost seven years of
“Labor” rule, Rafferty has had
too much sway in the Common-
wealth during that period.
Any development in unem-
ployment-control through finan-
cial control that may appear to
have been developed in Aus-
tralia during “Labor’s” term is
a world-wide development, and
has not been so politically abused
elsewhere. Except that it has
gone to extremes and created
excessive inflation, “Labor” has
contributed very little to the
technique of employment-crea-
tion, and its administration in
this respect has been accom-
panied by a heavy fall in output
per man-hour.
Any Government, Liberal-
C.P. or “Labor,” will find its
job in 1949 still subject to over-
seas influences. Dollars will re-
main a problem, though perhaps
a diminishing one, and as it is
evident that the United States
would sooner do business with
a Churchill than an Attlee, the
same sort of sentiment might
apply to Australia.
Marshall aid becomes less and
less like what it was originally
represented; that is, peace-time
lend-lease, with no economic
obligations. Various conditions
have been imposed on various
countries receiving Marshall aid,
and Britain has refused to
accept, in the form of a loan,
any aid that is to be applied
toward the purchase of con-
sumer goods. The U.S. House
of Representatives has also cut
the size • of Marshall aid to
Europe, while extending the
period over which the restricted
aid shall be spread. Senator Van-
denberg’s opposition to this re-
duction became the major issue
before Congress last week, and
public opinion (as well as the
Senate) was inclined to support
the Senator.
* * # ♦
Masonite 20s. ord. shares had
a strong rise to 50s. 3d. in the
market last week. The earning
capacity of this concern is such
that it has reduced the price of
its product several times in recent
years in spite of the unsatis-
fied demand. Benefit of the
duplicated plant is now being re-
flected in p. and 1. account in
spite of price-control. Harder
competition from G.S.R. wall-
board products is imminent; but
a wide market exists for all avail-
able plant output, and masonite
has a multitude of uses. Present
ord. div. rate is 8 p.c., but there
could be a good deal more than
that for shareholders under less
rigid conditions of Government
control.

A couple of Bundaberg sugar
men got hold of Senator Court-
ice recently and hinted that an-
other id, a pound on the price
ol refined sugar was sticking out
a mile. Since the last price in-
crease sugar fieldworkers’ wages
have jumped 11s. a week, cane-
cutters’ (on day-labor) 19s. a,
week, and contract cane-cutting
costs by Is. a ton. Greatly-
increased costs of farm imple-
ments, fuel and freights had to
be added, and, under the fixed
price, increased costs between
mill and consumer, such as jute,
handling, refining, etc., bounced
back on the raw-sugar producer.
Last year, with the overseas price
at around £29 a ton, only 14 p.c.
of the crop was Sold abroad,
the remainder going at £24,
which is actually less than
the 1932 price (£27) for home-
consumption. On present esti-
mates for the 1948 crop and
home and overseas consumption,
the average price for the coming
yield looked like being about
£26 a ton. But it would take
275,000 tons exported to do that,
otherwise the price would run
out about £23. The Minister
listened and appeared slightly
thoughtful; but any comment he
may have made wasn’t reported.


The many duties of an
Executor of a Will
THERE are many different matters to be handled
in administering an Estate. Each one requires
prompt attention, specialised knowledge, careful thought
and wise decision. If a trust be created, these responsi-
bilities may continue for years.
An inexperienced executor will find these duties
burdensome and his lack of experience may be very costly
to the Estate,
Perpetual Trustee Company Limited has over sixty

SEASONAL FORECASTING
By "Altera Merces."
[The seasonal weather forecasts of S. H. Ebery have a large
following among graziers and other landmen, and the writer of
this article is anxious to extend and establish securely for the
future the availability of services similar to those now rendered
almost single-handed by Mr. Ebery.]
Mr. S. H. Ebery, the subject
of a sub-leader (B. 28/1/’4B),
needs all possible help to get the
required meteorological data
from strategic points throughout
Australia in order to realise his
aim and ideas of the seasonal
forecasting which is absolutely
necessary for the economic effi-
ciency of pastoralists, graziers,
farmers and agriculturists.
Working alone, this man has
evolved, since he was a boy of 12,
a scientific system concerning the
movements of cirrus clouds and
their relation to the influences
governing droughts and bounti-
ful and average seasons. More-
over, he has demonstrated over
a great number of years his
ability to make seasonal fore-
casts 80 p.c. correct over a vast
area of Victoria, S.A. and
N.S.W. from his own cirrus
observations at Black Rock, near
Melbourne, plus temperatures
and barometric pressures gleaned
from the Government meteoro-
logical reports. Discussing
Ebery, one grazier said to me;
“If I could be given seasonal
forecasts that are 10 p.c. correct
it would do me.”
Mr. Ebery now has a few
voluntary observers like myself
who are enthusiasts and not only
have in their minds the help they
are giving him but the fact that
they are doing something essen-
tial to the welfare of our primary
industries. He holds a secret
knowledge of vast importance,
and has to make his living from
the farmers and graziers who
are his clientele; but he is a
scientist first, and wants to ex-
tend his seasonal forecasting to
cover the whole of Australia.
Until Governments recognise
him this can only be done by
voluntary observers, and the
only way to get them, in my
opinion, is through the pages of
The Bulletin.
I visualise that with this
assistance Mr. Ebery will be able
to make seasonal forecasts for
the different zones throughout
Australia that will be 95 p.c.
correct, or even better. Also, I
visualise that when farmers and
graziers of all States hear, and
benefit by, his forecasts a com-
pany will be formed on the lines
of a club, with an entrance-fee
and yearly subscription, and the
shareholders’ dividends will be
these forecasts. The voluntary
observers could then be paid for
their 20 minutes’ work a day,
and better instruments could be
provided, resulting in more effi-
cient and quicker observations.
Mr. Ebery would be manag-
ing-director and chief meteoro-
logist, with a staff of selected
and enthusiastic young men
whom he would train in seasonal
forecasting, and they could carry
on this important scientific
achievement after Mr. Ebery has
retired. Headquarters in Mel-
bourne and, say, 43 observers
at strategic points would entail
a yearly expenditure of not more
than £20,000. I ask, could there
be a sounder, cheaper and
better proposition for the
farmer? The Government this
year has voted £750,000 for
meteorological projects, and so
far, to my knowledge, their re-
ports cover 24 hours and are in-
variably altered, sometimes in
six hours—and then one can
never be sure of their correct-
ness.
I maintain that we graziers
and farmers should take it into
our own hands, and, when Mr.
Ebery is ready, form a seasonal-
forecasting company on the lines
I have envisaged and be inde-
pendent of Governmental in-
difference. Mr. Ebery’s is a
one-man show, and if he gives
up there will be no more sea-
sonal forecasting.
The type of men who are
needed as voluntary observers
are retired or active mining en-
gineers, geologists, surveyors,
sea captains and laymen with
a good education; but they
must all be enthusiastic. My ex-
perience is that watching for
cirrus each day is a fascinating
occupation, and has become
quite a pleasure. Mr. Eberys
instructions are lucid and
simple, and when one has
made the simple nephoscope and
has a watch, small compass and
pair of dark glasses one can
begin taking observations.
Attached is a rough map
showing 43 strategical points
where volunteers are needed for
this project.

SUNDRY SHOWS
"Traitor's Gate."
Although he makes no appear-
ance, the English king whom the
late James Edmond dubbed
“Henry the Horrible” domi-
nates this play by Morna Stuart,
put on by Newman College D.S.
at the Union Theatre, Univer-
sity of Melbourne. Henry is off-
stage busily engaged confiscating
monkish property and divorcing
Anne Boleyn, while Sir Thomas
More, his former chief adviser
and world champion and now
his noblest and most distin-
guished accuser, is on stage re-
fusing to endorse his master’s
actions.
More is shown in the bosom
of his family endeavoring to
shelter behind the law of silence,
being mentally tortured by
Thomas Cromwell, Lord Nor-
folk and Cranmer, being
marched to the Tower and in-
carcerated in a cell where he
has a perfect view of his future
place of execution, and being a
daily witness of the bumping-off
of other eminent statesmen who
have incurred Henry’s august
displeasure. One long act is en-
tirely given to the struggle be-
tween Sir Thomas’s writhing
flesh and his religious con-
science.
For some reason or other—
possibly because of the ineffec-
tiveness of Miss Stuart’s writing
or the general stiffness of the
actors —one never felt the plight
of Sir Thomas half as much as
one felt the presence of bis un-
seen persecutor who was prob-
ably so occupied with Anne’s
successor that he wasn’t giving
a thought to his ex-Lord High
Chancellor’s unfortunate posi-
tion.
Sir Thomas was a distin-
guished author who had fore-
stalled Marx by 300 years with
his Utopia and had reintro-
duced or bowdlerised Plato for
Europe, but nowhere does
Miss Stuart make one feel
his intellectual distinction, and
in his interpretation lan Mac-
Donald didn’t help her any. He
might have been any politician,
for that matter. There was
nothing in the opus in the nature
of a criticism, and that put his
death in an entirely different
category from the death of
Socrates as depicted so nobly in
the “Phaedrus.”
Some of the lesser characters,
Maureen Christie as the second
wife of Sir Thomas, Elaine Cop-
ley as his daughter, and Joy
Youlden as Peg Clement, his
adopted son’s wife, infused some
humanity into the proceedings,
but the rest of the cast was life-
less. Henry, however, lopping
off heads on Tower Hill, or
removing entrails without
anaesthetic at Tyburn, does live,
despite his non-appearance.
Anything stranger than the
decor —blessed word—of Nor-
man Wister it would be diffi-
cult to imagine. There might
be some justification in the text-
books for the sentimentality of
Sir Thomas’s domestic relations,
but there is none for Myer
Emporium chairs and tables in
a Tudor drawing-room, and if
any sixteenth-century craftsman
had executed the window in Act
I, scene 11, he would have suf-
fered the same fate as Sir
Thomas.

Alan Tory’s “Festival for
Simon,” at Sydney St. James’
Hall, is a play with a message.
Attempting to delineate the
transformation of Simon of
Cyrene, a strong-willed, venge-
ful Jew who, fulfilling his life
ambition to visit the land of his
fathers, carries Christ’s cross
part-way to Calvary and is con-
verted to one of His humble fol-
lowers, the play is cluttered with
superfluous characters and
flowery dialogue. Only a know-
ledge of the Bible gets the “mes-
sage” through. Edgar Yardley’s
unconverted Simon is played
with emotional force, but he and
his shrewish mother-in-law con-
verted to forgiving Christians
are about as convincing as the
very dead fish he catches off-
stage as a boy. Reg. Lye as the
serf Philemon is the best of 30
characters; the rest of the cast,
though enthusiastic, remain
amateurish.
Moiseitistsch.
Only a handful of the world’s
pianists would tackle with the
complete equanimity displayed
by Benno Moiseiwitsch at his
third Sydney recital, a pro-
gramme which included two
Beethoven sonatas, Moussorg-
sky’s “Pictures from an Ex-
hibition” and five Liszt Studies.
Of these the Moussorgsky is
the most exacting in terms of
interpretation.
The Russian poured into his
“Pictures” all the mordant wit
and sardonic humor that could
be expected from the composer
of the “Song of the Flea,” and
it was these qualities which
Moiseiwitsch’s playing, of a
sustained brilliance rarely heard,
brought vividly to the surface.
Some of the “Pictures,” such as
the Kiev Gate and the Ox-wagon
Scene, are merely adventures
into impressionism; in others,
such as the Castle picture, the
composer’s inventive edge wears
ragged. But the canvas is a vast
one, stark and at times barbaric
in the Oriental manner. Not all
are easy to listen to. But the
pianist made of them scenes of
intense interest.
Beethoven’s “Moonlight” and
“Pathdtique” sonatas gained the
dignity that is their due in read-
ings in which tenderness never
became weakness.
The all-Chopin of the fourth
recital had as its chief offering
the 24 Preludes, played with only
an almost-imperceptible pause
between each of the miniatures.
In these the whole gamut of
rhythmic paces and moods was
run.
In the Allegro of the B Flat
Minor Sonata Moiseiwitsch built
up with great skill the brooding
ominousness which spilled over
into the even greater degree of
imminent catastrophe of the
Scherzo. The great threnody
which follows became a monu-
ment of majestic solemnity.
The short finale, which is almost
an anti-climax, was tightly-
controlled and taken at a great
tempo.
Melbourne Music.
At the third “celebrity” con-
cert in Melbourne Town Hall,
’cellist Lauri Kennedy had to
retire backstage to repair a
broken string. Professor Heinze
turned the incident to advantage
by telling a story.
He related how an eminent
conductor had directed a new
symphony which the audience
received in a very lukewarm
manner. “Obviously,” said the
conductor, “you haven’t under-
stood this great work. I will
play it again,” and the audience
had to listen for another 50
minutes. Professor Heinze fol-
lowed this procedure in the case
of Bloch’s “Schelomo,” so the
packed house got part of it twice
over.
It was worth it. Coming after
the sweet, melodious, placid
Unfinished Symphony of Schu-
bert, it made an effective con-
trast in subject-matter, if not in
the quality of the orchestration.
Bloch’s concerto is a sort of
musical Wailing Wall in which
the Jewish spirit expresses its
savagery, sense of justice, sensu-
ality, despair, inordinate ambi-
tion, and, above all, its self-pity.
It is the antithesis of the soft
Schubert, though both composers
were equally tortured indi-
viduals. Kennedy’s ’cello-play-
ing, with its exactness and its
delicious sensitiveness, made it
glow and sparkle, and the audi-
ence gave him a great ovation.
There was similar applause
for Bertha Jorgensen, who took
her place officially for the first
time as the first woman orch-
estral leader in Australia. ,
Durack Paintings.
Elizabeth Durack, who is
having her second Melbourne
exhibition at the Velasquez Gal-
leries, has all, or nearly all, the
necessary ingredients. She has
the feeling and lives in Broome
solely because she can be in the
presence of her subject-matter,
which is almost exclusively the
abo. Her feeling for the abo.
isn’t sentimental or histrionic, and
she obviously tries to paint him
as he is, as in “Storm Around,”
in which a crowd of Binghi
children are caught on the hop
standing on a red road in very
natural postures ; in “Morning,”
in which more kids are depicted
playing on a mud swamp as
kids do play; in “Windy After-
noon,” with a lubra and a pic.
battling home against a head-
wind, and in “Goats,” which
animals, with the abo., seem to
form the bulk of the population
of the nor’-western outpost.
Miss Durack doesn’t subscribe
to any of the current fashions,
and that gives her a certain sim-
plicity and directness. All she
needs is to know the language
better, artistically speaking.
Rembrandt, with all his enorm-
ous skill, would have thought
twice before tackling the masses
of human figures she attempts
to deal with, and her lack in
this direction is most obvious
when she turns from her rapid
sketches to paint an aboriginal
Madonna like “Mother and
Child,” in which the paint is
tortured.

Bette Davis’s “Deception,” at Syd-
ney Century, wouldn’t deceive a
maiden uncle. In a house crammed
with costly furs and furniture, gifts
of sugar-daddy Claude Rains, she
uses all the Davis jugglery —outflung
hangs, voice-catching in mid-sentence
and swivelling eyes. But husband
Paul Henreid, talented ’cellist just out
of concentration camp, swallows her
explanation of rich music-pupils’ gifts,
which allows both men, to get on
with some excellent acting. Rains
writes concertos, Henreid plays ’em,
and Miss Davis goes the censor’s way
of all murderesses.
“B.F.’s Daughter’'’ (Sydney St.
James) is an interminable dirge con-
taining one real actor in Charles
Coburn as the maligned father. He
shows remarkable judgment in dying
of heart-failure long before the end,
and not waiting for boredom to do it.


Women’s letters
From Sydney
Up at Government House in the
square hall leading to the reception-
rooms there is a table made from the
reflector of a Japanese searchlight. On
it last Thursday night there was a Pekin
green bowl filled with roses. The pink
and dark-red and cream beauties were
reflected deep upon deep, to infinity it
seemed. Bending above such particular
and meticulous detail the gazer wondered
that any nook or cranny of Darwin sur-
vived the would-be invader. But it did
survive, and the King of this far-flung
bit of his Empire was being felicitated
on another birthday, a victorious one, a
glorious one, too, if you count the spirit
of his people. The reception at Govern-
ment House, the glittering chandeliers,
the massed flowers were to honor the
occasion.
The Governor, Lieut.-General North-
cott, and daughter Elizabeth stood in the
middle of the drawing-room receiving the
guests, Elizabeth’s deep-red velvets the
right toning for the fire glow, the masses
of winter foliage and flower. Later, Mrs.
Northcott, not well earlier in the night,
came down to greet guests informally.
With her long skirt of heavy white crepe
she wore a fitting jacket of the same
material closely embroidered.
From the gallery above the ballroom
the band played gay and free. Diplo-
mats and their wives were numerous.
Buoyant black tulles, shimmering with
gold sequins, and an off-shoulder neck-
line, softened with layers of the tulle,
were worn by Mrs. Alzate, wife of the
new Consul-General for the Philippines.
Mrs. L. A. Robb’s frock of soft black
crepe was draped and showed a touch of
jade-green.
Two graceful guests were Mrs. Basil
Foulds and Mrs. Alan Potter. Blue in
soft misty tones was chosen by both.
State Premier McGirr and Mrs. McGirr
were present. The Consul-General for
France and Mrs. Henri de la Croix, in
silvery greys, Dean of the Consular Corps
Dr. Vrisakis, knight Leslie Morshead and
his wife, Hubert Fairfax, Mrs. F. H. Berry-
man, Eugene Goossens, were in the chang-
ing groups. Mrs. Alexis Albert, in softly-
falling white-silk jersey, the skirt printed
in pink and blue ballet dancers, the
shoulder blooming with three white
roses, Mrs. Lars Jorstad in swaying black
taffetas, were pictorial. Dryad-brown
was Mrs. Charles Lloyd Jones’s frock.
This was of rich faille, the skirt cut slimly
at the top, flowed out in panelled full-
ness, each panel appliqued in brown
velvet. Finishing touch a shoulder scarf
of the velvet.
What the perfect short story is' to litera-
ture, so is “Cavalleria Rusticana” to
opera. ■ This one-acter has everything in
it. The Easter hymn and the drinking
song alone would make the work even
without the nobility of Santuzza’s out-
pourings of unrequited love. Lola, the
other Sicilian village beauty, is a baggage.
You spot this at once by first the swagger
of the hips, and then by the rose she
holds between her lips, and which she
flings to Turridu, who, frankly, isn’t
worth the bother. The Con. Opera School
put on this show last Saturday, linked
up with the other half-pint measure of
devil-to-pay, “I Pagliacci.” Here and
now both shows were good. Gloria Read
was the Santuzza who, singing with
musical and dramatic fervor, was, in spite
of the pious little crosses on her gala
apron, doomed by the composer from
her opening notes of “Mother Lucia.”
Margaret Kerr was an alluring, if a
sometimes shrewish, Nedda of Pagliacci.
It’s a pretty certain bet that there never
has been a Nedda with a trigger figure
and neater ankles. Both operas showed
great progress in acting and ease of man-
ner by the students. The make-up of the
girls in the chorus was not good. But
they were a spirited and neighborly lot.
The same villagers bounced across from
Sicily to Calabria, and in friendly
fashion contrived to be in at both deaths.
Director Eugene Goossens was in the
audience; so was Mrs. Roland Foster,
though Roland himself was missed. He
didn’t manage to get back from his health
trip for the opening. Hilda Mulligan
was on stage to take deserved applause.
Others applauded were conductor Florent
Hoogstoel, Frederick Foxley and Bill
Constable for his lovely sets, pulsating
with color, and washed through with sun-
shine.
The hearts of 5000 aged and disabled
ex-servicemen in England will be warmed
by the knowledge that the ex-servicemen
of Australia remember them. It has been
resolved by the committee of the R.S.L.
Victory Ball this year that from the pro-
ceeds of the celebration night at the Troc.
on August 19, 5000 express food parcels
will be sent to the same number of old
and young ex-soldiers. The president of
the British Legion, Colonel C. G. Larking,
has been asked to nominate the recipients
and to airmail their names and addresses.
On the great night debs will be presented
by Mrs. Fred Tinkler, whose husband,
Colonel Tinkler, is a veteran of World
Wars I and 11.
Vibrant and attractive Frances
Moran, from Perth, showed a crowded
Town Hall at last week’s A.B.C.
“Youth” concert what a very good pianist
she is. Nineteen-year-old Frances has
just won the A.B.C.’s three-year scholar-
ship to the Juilliard School of Music in
New York, and her playing with the
orchestra directed by Eugene Goossens
gave over 2000 listeners real delight.
Among the 2000 was brother Bryan, who
is stationed at Ingleburn. Rachmaninoff’s
Piano Concerto in C Minor was the work
chosen. The pianist’s frock was ankle-
length, full and swaying softness in misty-
blues, Frances embarks very soon for
her American studies.
Enid Savage, of Hunter’s Hill, only
child of Mr. and Mrs. A. H. Savage, be-
came the wife of Dr. Harvey Chester-
field-Evans, only son of Mr. and Mrs.
Chesterfield-Evans, of Bellevue Hill, last
week-end. Enid, tall and fair, wore a
frock of white marquisette inlet with
bands of lace. Her tulle veil was softly
frilled. Her flowers were stephanotis and
white hyacinths. ’Maid was ’groom’s
sister Elizabeth Chesterfield-Evans. The
bride, who was an occupational thera-
pist, has been at various rehabilitation
centres in Queensland. During the war
she was one of the keenest helpers at the
Air Force House information bureau run
by the Overseas League and was presi-
dent of the Overseas League Twentieth-
Century Group. Future home will be
Brisbane.
There’s a big job ahead on June 21 and
22 for Ailsa Aplette. On each night
this clever musician will open the Folk
Festival in the Town Hall by an organ
recital of British folk tunes. Ailsa, who
collected her teacher’s diploma for
piano at the Con. last year, is
quite up to the big recital ahead of her,
and early arrivals will be captivated by
this Sydney girl’s spirited and sympathetic
interpretation of old and forever-loved
airs. The Folklore Association of Aus-
tralia is organising the festival, which will
benefit the Sydney Day Nurseries. The
State Governor, Lt.-General Northcott,
and Mrs. Northcott will be present.

Madame Chiang Kai - shek’s War-

young China in Australia. Last night
the Trocadero was the scene of the
eleventh Dragon Festival in aid of this
great cause. The foyer of the Troc.
was transformed into a brightly-colored
courtyard scene, with gold pagodas for
background. The title of the ball was
emphasised by gilded dragons in the foyer
and ballroom. Thirteen bright-eyed debs,
were presented to the Consul-General
for China and Madame Woo Shih Ying.
Two of the debs., Gloria Gee, of Kya-
bram, Vic., and Gertrude Tong, of Bris-
bane, arrived by plane last week.
From Melbourne
Grand work has been done for the
Children’s Hospital in this city by the
American Women’s Auxiliary, which re-
cently celebrated its 17th birthday
by giving a party at the Australia.
Dominating the scene was an American
eagle fashioned of tawny-toned chrysan-
themums and autumn foliage with the
wings spread over a three-tiered ice-cream
birthday cake. A feature of the party was
the ceremonial pouring of tea by the
president, Mrs. Harold Rabling, and
Mrs. S. J. Fletcher, wife of the U.S.
Consul-General. Mrs. Rabling wore with
her black tailored suit an attractive veiled
black hat finished with pink roses
at each side. Mrs. Herbert Allen
was tailored in grey. Mrs. D. J.
Lampard effected contrast with deep-
mauve frock and small black halo hat
trimmed with gold feathers. Mrs.
W. Graves’s black hat, worn with a black
suit, was high-crowned and featured
black ostrich feathers. Wife of Col. H. B.
Hester, U.S. Military Attache, is a new
member of the auxiliary; scarlet coat
and black snood were her snappy choice.
Mrs. W. W. Killough, just returned from
the U.S., was busy handing out news of
the folks back home.
This year the Fourth of July Ball, to
be held at St. Kilda Town Hall, will be
“Up in Central Park.” Mrs., Harold
Hillman, who smiles at you here, is one
of the ticket-secretaries. She hails from
Vermont, U.S.A., is a graduate of Bin-
nington University, has done designing
and modelling for ski clothes in New
York and is an ardent skier. Last year
her husband won the Australian skiing
championship.
The ’flu prevented Sir Laurence Olivier
from attending the late-afternoon party
given by Garnet Carroll and his wife at
their Domain-road home, but Lady
Olivier had recovered sufficiently to be
there. The guest-of-honor wore a deep-
grey Scots mole-fur wrap over her ankle-
length black frock ; her small Regency
hat of black panne velvet was swathed
with Patou-pink ostrich feathers and
green veiling. Mrs. Carroll’s afternoon
gown of black silk faille was fashioned
with an overskirt at the back edged with
a deep border of black broderie Anglaise.
The deep neckline of the bodice was filled
in with similar lace. Mrs. T. Hollway
wore a navy ensemble and matching hat.
Lady Hyde’s beige jacket-suit was
trimmed with brown fur and her brown
hat with velvet ribbon. Bob Menzies and
his wife, she in brown fur-trimmed coat
and small brown hat, took time off from
packing for England to come along. Mrs.
Bernard Heinze was in ermine coat and
brown hat. Lady Blarney’s black suit was
worn with a small hat swathed and tied
under the chin with white chenille-dotted
black veiling. Mrs. Paddy Moran added
a tip-tilted avian head concoction to her
brown fur-trimmed suit. Mrs. Harold
Wootton topped her fur-trimmed tailored
brown coat with a hat in the same ton-
ing.
Sir Laurence Olivier had the greatest
difficulty in entering the foyer of the
Athenaeum Theatre when a huge crowd
of admirers pushed and jostled in their
efforts to catch a glimpse of the man
who took the role of the “gloomy Dane”
in “Hamlet,” which was having its
premiere. Frank Talbot Theatres Pty.,
Ltd., lent the theatre for the afternoon to
the committee of the Lord Mayor’s Hos-
pital Fund ; the’ film was lent by British
Dominion Films, A distinguished audi-
ence included the Governor, Sir Winston
Dugan, and Lady Dugan, Mrs. J. O.
Haselden and Mrs. George Maxwell.
With Mrs. George Griffiths, who was
wearing a navy suit and small navy hat
embellished with white roses, was her
daughter Carole. Mrs. Alex Finlay’s
peacock-blue wool suit was worn with a
leaf-brown felt hat trimmed with match-
ing velvet ribbon bows. Mrs. Bon Guest
chose a brown suit and sage-green hat
highlighted with brown ostrich feathers.
With Mrs. Wallace Mitchell were her
daughter, Mrs. Dudley Gordon, and Mrs.
Jeffrey McLachlan, the former Betty Jess.
Mrs. Eric Fowler, in black ensemble and
small hat trimmed with gaily-striped
taffeta ribbon, was with her daughter,
Mrs. Peter Parker, her deep-brown wool
coat featuring a brown-fox collar, her
large off-the-face hat trimmed with
velvet.
Quietly married at the Hotel Windsor
by Chaplain-General A. H. Stewart were
Shirley, elder daughter of Mr. and Mrs,
Mclntosh Grant, of Auckland, and Dan,
son of Mrs. T. B. O’Connor, also of
Auckland —Dan is handling the tour of
the Old Vic. Co. on behalf of the British
Council. Shirley’s beige lightweight
woollen frock had black faille collar and
pocket lapels. Her mushroom-shaped felt
hat and fox-furs, in which was pinned a
green orchid, completed her ensemble. A
small cocktail party gave friends an
opportunity of offering their felicitations.
Sir Laurence Olivier was there to toast
the bride; indisposition had prevented
Lady Olivier from attending. Brian
Jones, of the British Council, and his
wife, Mr. and Mrs. Garnet Carroll and
their son John, the ’groom’s cousin,
Arthur Van Towsey, and his wife, and
singer Peggy Knibb made up the rest of
the party.
The flowers that bloom in the spring
will not be more colorful than the fabrics
women will wear after the furs and the
tweeds have been parked among the moth-
balls. This was the impression gained
at the Douglas Cox preview of spring
fashions worn by leading mannequins.
The light woollen Australian-made crepes
were featured, as well as Swiss prints,
Canadian fabrics and American cottons
made up into a wide variety of styles
from the formal to everyday wear. The
“new look” was still to the fore, but was
made becoming with soft pastel prints ;
the bold, hard florals were absent. A
Merrie England print which had a pattern
of castles, knights in armor and similar
medieval motifs had charm, while the
woodlands and undersea scenes made in
Swiss prints were also a delight. New
sidelights on spring fashions were skirts
13in. from the ground; ankle-length
evening and dinner gowns and coats
which have graduated lapels, shawl
collars and shoulder capes. Out of the
past comes the highwayman’s coat with
its triple-collar. Pleats are in the news,
mostly of the unpressed variety. Neck-
lines on frocks are scooped out, have
drawstrings or are deeply square-cut.
Waistlines are stressed with cords or have
deep inset bands of contrasting color;
the hems of black cocktail frocks show a
dainty frilling of white Swiss lace match-
ing little vestees on the bodice and frills
at the edges of the short sleeves. After
the preview Douglas Cox and his wife
entertained at a cocktail party. Mrs. Cox
wore a black coat with silver-fox collar
and small black hat, velvet-ribbon
trimmed. Creator of the fashions, clever
Australian Mrs. Dudley McLaughlin, was
in a smart black new-look frock.
The last performance by the Old Vic.
Company of Thornton Wilder’s “Skin of
Our Teeth” ended in a triumphant tribute
to the players, who have over the two-
months season given such pleasure to
the audiences of this city. Cheers and
applause and, from the “gods” on
Olympus, dozens of colored streamers
which were caught by those on stage,
came at the final curtain. Both Sir
Laurence and his wife made appropriate
speech. Brian Jones and his wife brought
a party which included the Premier and
Mrs. Hollway, the latter wearing a lovely
hyacinth-blue gown under her fur wrap,
Mrs. Rupert Downes, in a soft-rose-pink
gown beneath her dyed-ermine coat, and
the recently-honored Sir John Medley,
Vice-Chancellor of the ’Varsity. Sir John
Latham abandoned horsehair in favor
of the boiled shirt. With Mrs. S.
Baillieu Myer, who has just been given
the 0.8. E. for her splendid war work
with the Red Cross, was her daughter
Marigold. Mrs. Philip Dare, who brought
a party which included Alice Adcock and
Esther Kent, wore a black frock, dyed-
squirrel coat and small black hat which
carried a cluster of black flowers at the
side.
Mrs, Garnet Carroll’s lovely bouffant
frock of black chantilly lace dotted here
and there with black sequins featured an
off-the-shoulder line and elbow-length
sleeves finished in points over the wrists.
With artist Daryl Lindsay was his wife,
whose black gown glistened with sequins
which matched the gold flowers in her
hair. Mrs. T. J. Dowd’s gown was of
hyacinth-blue crepe, her cape of white-
fox. Mrs, Frank Tak covered her hair
with a glittering rhinestone-and-black
net sari; her slimly-cut black gown was
worn under a dyed-ermine coat. Nancy
Cooper’s pastel-blue and silver-lame gown
was worn with a hip-length silver mus-
quash coat. Pat Christie added a beige
fox cape stole to her grey white-patterned
gown. Jim and Betty Poore, she in a
black gown and black-velvet tailored coat,
were enthusiastic applauders.

THE SERVICE MAN
Danger in Europe.
“Ek Dum”: It has always
been realised among those who
study the situation closely that
the months between June and
September this year would be the
most threatening that the world
has seen since 1939. In that
period many matters must reach
their crises, and all those crises
centre round the stands taken
by the U.S.S.R. and the United
States, particularly the former.
There is no question that Rus-
sian intentions f are aggressive.
There is no doubt that if the
Kremlin dared and the stake
seemed to be within reach it
would strike with military force
and call for the support of its
fifth-columns irr every country
to destroy non-Communist Gov-
ernments and to begin insurrec-
tion.
The ambitions of Communism
are set out clearly in every
basic pamphlet, book or leaflet
which is published. The only
reason the authors and issuers of
these declarations of policy are
not dealt with is that the com-
munities in which they operate
are lulled into a sense of false
security because the traitorous
elements have a cunning tech-
nique. Themselves the haters of
freedom of expression, which
would die a sudden death if they
ever achieved power, they
clamor for the very rights which
they aim to destroy violently as
cover for their operations.
“Right of free speech” is a
slogan of every Communist plat-
form until Communists become
the arbiters of whether it shall
reign or not. It then becomes
clear that it means right of free
speech for Communists only.
Field-Marshal Smuts, installed
as Chancellor of Cambridge
University on June 10, and
shorn by the loss of office of the
need to be diplomatic, has de-
scribed the position as every
public man on all sides in Europe
must know it. He said;
The hour has struck to call a halt
to this fifth-column and to say to
the Great Power behind it: “Thus far
and no farther! ” The new technique
of conquest without war has proved
so successful it has all but proved
a substitute for war itself.
So it has, even in Australia. If
the public of this country could
be made to understand the extent
to which trained Communists
are exercising control in public
affairs they would be shocked
and astounded and would have
no doubt about the reason why
Moscow, through great trade-
unions, can dictate our foreign
policy in matters such as the In-
donesian question, can decide
what ships shall come to the
country and which shall not,
and whom we shall trade with
and whom we shall not.
Field-Marshal Smuts con-
tinued :
Russia is exploiting Western Europe’s
fear of war, and will continue as long
as she thinks she can play the game
without the risk of a real war
Pacifism, disarmament and unpre-
paredness act as direct incentives to
this form of aggression. They form
great temptation to the would-be
aggressor The new technique is
dangerous because of the political
disguise under which it advances. War
is an open affair, easily recognised
as a horrid thing, but its new sub-
stitute is insidious and secret, work-
ing under cover and camouflage. It
is a negation of all we fought for
in the war, with Soviet Russia sub-
stituted for Nazi Germany. The
future of Europe is at stake. Things
may happen which neither blood nor
tears may wash away afterwards.
Salvaging Europe or at least Western
Europe and its physical and spiritual
values is our first priority.
In every country in Europe—
in the eastern ones in a. stage
of absolute conquest by the
U.S.S.R., in the west only a step
or two behind —Communism is
on the move to a degree which
will make it presently a neces-
sity for various Governments to
decide whether they will remain
Western, free and civilised or
spill over into the East into the
barbarism of slave camps and
police States. *
It seems that it will be very
difficult to settle the problem of
Germany without various coun-
tries, and particularly France,
deciding the matter firmly and
unequivocally. The crisis has
already arrived for France with
the six-Power decision in favor
of setting up a Western German
State with international control
of the Ruhr.
Division of Germany, unfor-
tunately, is an almost physical
impossibility and would only
have been thought of by theorists
of the Attlee-Evatt type.
The whole economy of Europe
depends on German coal, Ger-
man metal industries and Ger-
man communications being
the heart of Europe, all the
great river and canal steamship
systems run through Germany.
Western Germany cannot exist
with its present population on a
“Never mind about her, doc. —she’s healthy enough
stable economic basis without
the foodstuffs of eastern Ger-
many. These are in Russian
hands and will remain in Rus-
sian hands as captured materials
unless Russia is forced to dis-
gorge.
And eastern Germany can
scarcely live without either de-
pendence on Russia and satel-
lite eastern Europe or integra-
tion with industrial western Ger-
many. France has real reason
to be alarmed at the prospect in
front —and so has the rest of the
civilised world, more immedi-
ately the Scandinavian States,
not to mention Austria, which
must be blotted out if eastern
Germany goes permanently be-
hind the Iron Curtain.
It is going to take something
close to a miracle to settle the
present world problems—of Ger-
many, Japan, Korea, China and
southern Asia, without further
recourse to arms. That horrible
alternative is only escapable if
the Russians can be compelled to
alter their present policy, which
they show every sign of intensi-
fying rather than abandoning.
"Peace" in Palestine.
“Ek Dum”: After much
manoeuvring, an uneasy truce
was arranged between Jews and
Arabs, and became operative on
June 11, as the result of the
manoeuvres of Count Berna-
dotte, the U.N.O. mediator.
The scheme, which supposedly
provides for a month’s perfect
peace while the combatants are
brought together on main issues,
does not hold much promise.
The extremist sections of the
Jewish organisations are opposed
to the truce. The Arabs as a
whole declare firmly that any
settlement will be dependent on
the liquidation of the State of
Israel and the maintenance of a
united Palestine ; and the Trans-
jordan Premier, Tewfik Pasha,
has added to the difficulties by
stating that Count Bernadette
had given him an assurance that
he had power to scrap past
U.N.O. decisions and to leave it
to the Arabs and Jews to come
to an agreement.
Such an agreement will be
difficult to arrive at, since the
Arabs will stand out for their
united Palestine ideal and
U.N.O. will have difficulty in
dealing with their arguments.
If Palestine is united the Arabs
have a two-to-one majority of
votes and the right to dictate
policy by ballot, irrespective of
the other rights which they con-
sider themselves to possess
through immemorial occupation.
The truce did not come about
until the Arabs had established
superiority from a military view-
point, despite the Jewish claim
made by the Israelite Premier,
Mr. David Ben-Gurion, that
“our fighting forces hold not
only the area allotted to the
Jews by the U.N.O. partition
plan last November, but have
conquered areas outside these
boundaries.”
There seemed very little hope
for a maintenance of the truce
from the beginning, since within
an hour of laying down arms
accusations of aggression were
made mutually. Already on
June 12 each side was accusing
the other of breaches, and the
mediator, Count Bernadotte, was
(according to the press) “blaming
the Jews for truce breaches.”
R.N. and R.A.N.
The section of the British
Naval Estimates which deals
with 1948-49 construction is de-
pressing beyond words.
Harland and Wolff, in Bel-
fast, are at work on a fleet air-
craft carrier about 40ft. longer
than Implacable and Indefatig-
able—Bo3ft. 9in. long, 112 ft. 9in.
beam, 16 4.5 in. and 61 other
guns. This is the nearest ap-
proach to a capital ship under
construction in spite of the
wiping-out of several battleships,
leaving the heavy fleet at its
lowest level in modern history.
There is nothing on the tapis
to match the 65,000-ton carrier
which has been planned by the
United States Navy, Next come
Centaur and Albion, roughly in
the same class as Formidable and
Indomitable. These were
launched in April and May last
year. Another full-sized fleet-
carrier is planned—it has now
been placed under way on the
stocks.
Six light fleet-carriers are in
process of construction —some
of them about finished —695 ft.
long by 80ft. beam. These be-
long to the Majestic (Colossus)
class, round about 14,000 tons.
Their names as they stand in the
Navy lists are Terrible, Magnifi-
cent, Powerful, Majestic, Levia-
than, Hercules ; but two of them
are to come to Australia —one
as H.M.A.S. Sydney. It is
curious to note that although
the Commonwealth Govern-
ment last year produced the idea
of these vessels triumphantly as
if it had just then taken a stern
resolution to do something
desperate and revolutionary in
building them, they were
actually on the stocks as far
back as 1944. They are obvi-
ously the R.N.’s left-overs from
the war.
Three new British cruisers are
on the way—Swiftsure class,
very serviceable, heavily armed
(nine 6in. guns, 10 4in. and two
quadruple tubes). Their names
are Defence, Blake and Tiger,
and there are a couple of de-
stroyers round about the battle-
class in fighting weight—Alamein
and Broadsword—and eight
more planned.
It certainly is not a very im-
pressive programme. But Aus-
tralia cannot criticise. The
Royal Naval Estimates provide
for as many commissioned
officers and midshipmen as there
are personnel in all ranks in the
R.A.N. With about six times
Australia’s population, the U.K.
envisages a total service of
144,000, not including 18,150
Royal Marines and the W.R.N.S.
British defence cost in this
lean year, amid the gloomiest
comments from those who see
a dark future for peace, is
£692,000,000 sterl i n g—
£865,000,000 Australian or
equal to nearly 18 years’ expen-
diture as planned by the Chifleys.
It seems that it is about time
this country threw overboard
some of its squandering social-
service schemes, which it cannot
afford, and went in for some
national insurance obtained
through pulling its weight in
British Commonwealth defence.
At present, as usual, it is loafing
on John Bull and Uncle Sam in
every defence department.
Australia First Cases.
“Ek Dum”: Dr. Evatt, de-
fending himself when Mr. J. T.
Lang demanded that he should
waive the Statute of Limitations
and allow one of the innocent
Australia First men, Keith Bath,
to sue the Commonwealth for
damages for false imprisonment,
took credit to himself in that
when he took over the Security
Department he reduced the per-
sons in internment from 8000 to
a few hundreds. He said that it
was preposterous to say that any
attempt had been made to de-
prive Bath of justice. He was
“one of a group of persons
whom the Army detained in
March or April, 1942, on the
recommendation of Army In-
telligence.” When he came into
office, Dr. Evatt said, he re-
viewed the Australia First cases
and immediately ordered the
release of Bath and several other
men.
What he failed to say was:
(1) That the first demand for the
internment of the Australia FijJst
men came from the Communist party.
(2) That immediately following this
demand, on December 6, 1941, he
himself told Mr. Falstein in the
House that he v.as having the move-
ment investigated.
(3) That his department was re-
sponsible (a) for stopping all prose-
cutions of Communists pending at
that time, ( b ) for making it possible
for the Communist party to carry on
its illegal operations openly, (c) for
suppressing in March, 1942, the meet-
ings of the Australia First movement,
at which nothing illegal was being
advocated and with no demand for
its suppression except from the Com-
munist ' party, (d) for arranging the
employment of an agent provocateur
in Western Australia who untruthfully
presented himself (on official instruc-
tion) as an agent of the innocent
Australia First men in Sydney come
over to organise treasonable activities.
(4) That his [Dr. Evatt’s] virtuous
determination to release the A.F. men
unjustly interned was arrived at very
slowly and only after he had faced a
surge of public opinion which forced
his hand; also, that it took months
to get the Australia First men out,
but it took him only 10 days to re-
lease Ratliff and Thomas, two Com-
munist officials, when Mr. Ward took
a petition into Cabinet from a body
called the Council of Civil Liberties.
This body was one which was
wildly indignant at the suppres-
sion of the Communist party
and its official organs and which
had devoted itself to the salvag-
ing of imprisoned and interned
Communists during the war—it
rarely tried to salvage any
others. The Council found it-
§elf “well placed to take up with
the new [Curtin] Government
matters involving civil liberties
not only was its vice-presi-
dent, Mr. Ward, a member of
the Cabinet but Dr. H. V.
Evatt, K.C., M-H.R. for Barton,
was Attorney-General and
Minister for External Affairs..
he had often advised the general
secretary.”
It was this curious organisa-
tion to which he had been
adviser which pressed Dr.
Evatt to cease the prosecution
of Communists, to withdraw
pending prosecutions and to re-
lease large numbers of “anti-
Fascists” who were interned, and
thus earn the right to pat him-
self on the back as one of the
heroes of liberty. Large num-
bers of those whom he released
had been sent to Australia from
Britain for internment during
the blifz —foreign Communists
who were considered to be too
dangerous to keep in the intern-
ment camps there with every
Communist in Britain yelling
for peace with Hitler and inva-
sion threatening.
Dr. Evatt further does not
say, when he takes credit for the
release of the Australia First
men, that, though he released
them because they were inno-
cent, they were treated for
months afterwards as if they
were residents of a police State.
They were hounded by detec-
tives day and night. They were
forced to confine themselves to
certain localities. One, a sick old
man, 74 years of age, whose only
crime appeared to be that he
had given largely to patriotic
funds just before his intern-
ment, was awakened after mid-
night suddenly by Dr. Evatt’s
minions and ordered to go to
Picton, 50 miles in the country,
and stay there. Not a word of
evidence .worth a moment’s con-
sideration was produced against
him before the commission of
inquiry.
Bath, a sedentary worker and
ill, who had been completely
ruined by his internment —
though about the only incrimi-
nating thing which was found
among his effects was a Union
Jack was, upon his release
from internment, at once
conscripted and sent to work in
the wet mullock at the bottom
of the Sydney graving dock in
the face of the production of a
doctor’s certificate showing him
to be a diabetic whose life would
thereby be endangered. It took
strong pressure to save him from
his fate.
Dr. Evatt says nothing about
the case of the soldier Harley
Matthews, a friend of the late
Chief of the General Staff, Sir
Brudenell White, who was in-
terned and then subjected to sur-
veillance under Doctor Evatt’s
orders, after he had been shown
to be completely innocent.
He does not mention the case
of the young soldier, Downe,
who was actually appointed, on
the personal intervention of the
head of the Military Intelligence
Department in Eastern Com-
mand, to the secret cipher de-
partment of the Army at the
time when Dr. Evatt’s represen-
tatives were holding him up be-
fore Mr. Justice Clyne as a per-
son whose internment was justi-
fied. And he does not explain
how this man came to be ap-
pointed to the cipher department
without his Security Department
knowing it, and how, if they
knew about it, it came about
that this salient fact about this
young fighting commando was
suppressed before the Commis-
sioner, to his virtual ruin.
Furthermore, he says nothing
of poor Watts, pronounced in
court a loyal and decent citizen,
who was interned, thrown out
of his employment, dogged,
ruined, broken in health and left
starving till he finally died in
the Prince of Wales Military
Hospital, Randwick (N.S.W.),
while the hearing was in pro-
gress, without knowing that his
name had been cleared.
The Government is still hear-
ing echoes of the Mulcahy-Blain
incident. At the Queensland
State Congress of the Returned
Soldiers’ and Sailors’ Imperial
League at Rockhampton it was
agreed unanimously:
That this Congress deeply resents
the vile and slanderous attack upon
the honor and integrity of ex-Sergeant
Blain by Mr. Mulcahy, M.H.R., under
the cloak of Parliamentary privilege,
and records with disgust that no
apology was tendered either by Mr.
Mulcahy or by any member of the
Federal Government, notwithstanding
that the Parliamentary Committee
completely refuted the slanderous
charge levelled by Mr. Mulcahy,

AND IT'S
RED MILL RUM.
Despite the fair prizemoney of
£2OOO, only a very ordinary bunch
of sprinters faced the starter for the
June Stakes (6f.), run at Randwick
on Saturday, the first day of the
AJ.C.’s Winter meeting. The much
larger prizes on offer at the forth-
coming S.T.C. meeting, and in Bris-
bane, influenced owners of the better-
class animals at present in training
to give the Randwick fixture a miss.
Hopping straight into the lead, the
Law Maker gelding Trover (A.
Ward) made a one-horse act of
the Stakes, though favorite Earl
Pentheus, and this page’s selection
Proud Monash, came on the scene
to enliven the finish; Trover, how-
ever, battled on to beat Earl Pentheus
a half-neck, with Proud Monash
close-up third. With a couple of
others, Trover started at 12 to 1;
six of the ten other runners were
at shorter odds.
Small fields contributed to the tight
betting noted throughout the day and
reflected also by the tote. Of the 21
place-tote dividends produced by
seven races, only one was in excess
of £l, Proud Monash paying £1 4s.
—a most unusual happening, particu-
larly at Randwick.
Ever since he swapped his jockey’s
licence for that of a trainer, Maurice
McCarten has always had one or two
useful middle-distance gallopers in his
stable to keep the pot boiling. In
the past year or so he has bagged
a number of races with the Midstream
four-year-old Herbert River, and on
Saturday added the 10-furlongs Elles-
mere Handicap to the score. Herbert
River was ridden a model race by
McCarten’s apprentice A. Richard-
son to down New Cashmere and
Alkestu. It was Richardson’s first
metropolitan success. Favorite Fres-
cano was unsuited by the muddling
early pace, and was boxed in on the
rails when he might have made a race
of it.
Though it is usually bad policy to
attach too much importance to winter
form, the Speardale filly De La Salle
looked a bit of real class as she fairly
toyed with other three-year-old fillies
in the St. Aubin’s Handicap of a
mile. She has done most of her
comparatively little racing in the bush,'
this being her second outing in Syd-
ney—and her second win. Carrying
topweight of 9st. on a softish track,
she took charge at the distance, and
won by six lengths from Nechi.
Another very easy winner was the
three-year-old Karachi (W. Cook),
downing Yamboon by-five lengths in
the Trial Stakes (10f.). Karachi
started favorite for the A.J.C. Derby,
but disappointed, as he has done on
other occasions. He certainly looks
the part—a fine big stamp of a horse
—and he’s exceptionally well bred,
but he was very leniently treated by
the fixed scale of weights in the Trial.
Other Randwick winners were
Revenir (J. Thompson) taking the
June Nursery for fillies; Meteor (N.
Sell wood) adding the Juvenile for colts
and geldings to his growing list of
successes; and Strathdarr (R. Pearse)
taking the mile Exeter Handicap and
showing that he had benefited by
being saddled up twice at Randwick
the previous week.

Usually the forte of Melbourne
punters, jumping events were, at
Flemington on Saturday, disastrous.
Gordon Fox (40 to 1) and Bronze
Laddie (12 to 1) gave doubles bookies
a clean skinner, and took little but
speculative nibbles from the straight-
out men.
It would be unwise to dismiss
Gordon Fox’s win as a fluke because
of his starting at such long odds in
the York Hurdle. Actually his win
was full of merit and he is nicely in
the Grand National with only 9.6.
Gordon Fox is an aged black gelding
by Charles Fox; he finished with
plenty in reserve to defeat Sun Eagle
and Glenriven. Favorite for the York
was the National-favorite Lugano,
having his first go at the jumps for
nearly a year, and the way he drifted
in the betting didn’t suggest real con-
fidence in the camp.
Though he won not loqg back over
the fences at Flemington, Bronze
Laddie subsequently failed at Moonee
Valley, which accounted for his price
in the Hopetoun Steeple. However,
he must be partial to Flemington, and
a record of two wins from four starts
on that course enhances his National
prospects. Short ,of a run, Benarca
was a good second in the Hopetoun
and old Tente third.
Attley, who recently changed hands
for a consideration of 4000 guineas,
gave his new owner, R. Sackville,
some encouragement by lumping a
plaster of 9.10 to win die first Lan-
caster Handicap (7f.) from Viceroy
and Clipper. The second division of
the Lancaster saw Harold Badger
score his first win since he came a
nasty cropper on Columnist some
weeks ago. Badger rode the ex-
Sydney galloper Decorate and had
to extricate him from a difficult posi-
tion at the half-mile to defeat Kep-
lerian and Law Case.
A mass of two-year-olds—33 of
them in all —charged up the straight
six-furlongs course for the Rothsay
Handicap, and favorite Trellis was
lost in the bun-rush. Spoor (F.
Dummett), at 20 to 1, scored well
from Narella and King Simeon.
Rather more palatable was the result
of the Sandringham Handicap (13f.),
won by Clatterbag (A. Breasley) at 7
to 2, though the favorite, Britisher,
finished only third, behind Prince
Charles. The Buckingham Handicap
went to Meadower (J. Gilmore).
* * * *
Just to make it more difficult, the
powers that be thought up a fog
for the Marlborough Hurdle, the first
leg of the jumping double at Fleming-
ton on Monday, but it didp’t prevent
Latani lumping top weight of 11.2
to win from The Feline, who jumped
riskily, and John Masefield. In the
other leg, the Royal Steeple, David
Star gave a nice exhibition of fencing
out in front to beat Bronze Laddie
(finishing extra well) and Garofil.
* * * *
At Randwick the snag on Monday
was a track so heavy that it took
Romany King I.l l\ to cover the six
furlongs of the first event, downing
Cognac and Lone Duke—all no doubt
appropriate enough for a King’s
Birthday. In the next event, for
two year-olds, lolanda took 1.3 If
covering the seven furlongs; Flume
and Persist in the places.

Passed on in Sydney last week
Hanson (“Sep”) Carter, who kept
wicket for Australia from 1907 to
1921, and was one of the best ever.
He was born in Yorkshire 70 years
ago, and when he played for Aus-
tralia at Leeds in 1921 had the dis-
tinction of being the only Yorkshire-
man on the Yorkshire field. In busi-
" When ARE you going to buy a new golf-bag?"
ness as an undertaker, Carter made
a lot of money, and he was all through
most generous with it.

The first Test:
After putting Sussex through the
mill in two days (another innings
victory), the tourists shifted to Not-
tingham last Thursday for the first
Test. In the face of the visitors’
undefeated record, the English selec-
tors chose nine players with previous
Test experience and added new blood
in Laker and Young to strengthen
the bowling.
Yardley won the toss and chose
to bat, but rain interrupted proceed-
ings until lunchtime, though in one
brief spell of play Hutton was clean-
bowled by Miller for 3. The weather
lifted after lunch, but the procession
proceeded, good wickets falling cheap
until Laker and Alec Bedser got to-
gether to add 89 for the ninth wicket;
the side was all out for 165. Only
74 overs were sent down, and Bill
Johnston, making his Test debut on
English wickets, took 5 for 36.
Painfully slowly and methodically,
Australia set about consolidating its
position. Morris went for 31; Barnes
was out to a magnificent catch by
wicketkeeper Evans after scoring 62;
the crowd heaved a sigh of relief
when Miller went for a duck, and
the stodgy Brown for 17. Meanwhile
Bradman was playing a grand cap-
tain’s innings to be 130 at stumps,
with Hassett 41, and 293 on the
board for the loss of four wickets.
Resuming on Saturday, Bradman
soon went (bowled Bedser, caught
Hutton) for 138 —his 18th Test cen-
tury v. England, 28th in all Tests,
and 110th in first-class cricket; and
he notched up the first 1000 of the
season. lan Johnson got 21, Tallon
10, and, after Hassett (137) and
Lindwall (42) had added 107 for the
eighth wicket, Toshack (surprising
with 19) and Johnston (17 n. 0.)
rounded off the innings at 509. Up
to this stage the hero of the English
effort had been the last-minute in-
clusion Laker, topscorer his side
and taking four valuable wickets for
138. The Australians badly overdid
their cautious play; it is difficult
to believe that Young’s bowling
was as good as is implied by his
remarkable figure of 26 maiden overs,
including 11 in a row.
With a leeway of 344 to make up,
England began dismally with two
down for 39; then Hutton (C 3) and
Compton (36) settled in and had
121 on the board at stumps on the
third day.

For the holiday weekend V.F.L.
followers had their sport spread over
two days. On Saturday a crowd of
20.000 saw “Sowth” beaten on its
own ground by Fitzroy; Fitzroy
was on top all the way to win 15.11-
9.12. There were 18,000 to see
Essendon untroubled in downing
North Melbourne 12.14-4.8, and
15.000 watched Collingwood lick
Hawthorn 12.27-8.8,

N.S.W. Rugby Union team beat
Queensland 22-6 at Sydney Show-
ground in what may be described as a
“dour” game. Most of the dourness was
on the Queensland side, centres Burke
and Bridgman keeping N.S.W. centres
Davis and the brilliant Allan well
bottled up, although Allan, playing
a correctly orthodox game, managed
to get the ball out often for Tonkin
to make a number of dashes, which
were stopped, and for Walker, also
playing on the wing, to score three
tries. Walker played a pool and
clever game; Tonkin had nothing but
his speed to recommend him.
Campbell, as five-eighth, was spas-
modically penetrating, but dropped a
lot of passes, Burke, the half, played
brilliantly, and Broad played a solid
five-eighth game for Queensland.
Richards, N.S.W. breakaway, was
outstanding among the forwards.

In his match with Johnny Davis
(9.1) at Leichhardt Ted Sprouster
(9.2 i) irked the mob by appearing
to take things very leisurely for the
first four rounds, Davis fighting him
all over the ring. Thereafter Sprouster
scored repeatedly with lefts and rights
to the chin, and, despite taking a
count of eight in the ninth round,
had the fight well won at the finish.
Meeting at Melbourne Stadium,
Sydneysider Tommy Ward (10.8) and
Victorian Ken Murphy (10.8) seemed
mutually off form. In a dull bout
Murph. was somewhat the more
aggressive, but Ward gave him a box-
ing lesson to win on points.


ABORIGINALITIES
THE UMBRELLA.
The lion came home trembling to his mate
With shattered nerves, yes, in a pitiful state;
She and her cubs must sheathe expectant claws
For he had brought no breakfast in his paws.
And he at length, sadly, with puzzled brows,
Told his affecting story to his spouse:
“Prowling at eve along a jungle track
I met a missionary, clad in black,
Young, plump and fresh, as delicate a dish
As any hungry beast of prey could wish,
Alone, unarmed, defenceless as a chick.
Carrying nothing but a short black stick.
And then, as I crouched ready for the spring,
The fellow did a most amazing thing—
He held his feeble wand before my face,
Then suddenly he vanished from the place.
Lo, what I saw before me was a sphere
Of lustrous jet which filled my soul with fear;
Flashed out of nothing by some magic art,
It froze the very cockles of my heart,
As sinister, mysterious a sight
As ever burst forth from the womb of night.
In face of that, my dear, what could I do?
I turned my tail and scuttled home to you.”
mx. Arnold Wall.

“Bybren”: For six years Joe had been
“keeping company” with Jenny Simmons
from Farminer’s Rock. Every second
Tuesday evening his ancient Chev.
could be seen chugging up the incline
beyond the Timpara pub on its
eight-mile trip to see Jenny and
the travelling picture-show that always
came to the Rock on that day, rain or
shine. Local interest in the ro-mance had
long since died out, to flare up occasion-
ally, such as when Joe made two trips in
the one fortnight, or when some visiting
young blood took a fancy to Jenny and
tried to barge in. When old Simmo’s
nephew from the city arrived for a couple
of weeks speculation was rife as to
the bona fides of the visitor, and when
Jenny was seen leaving the hall in the
middle of the show with the “nephew,”
leaving Joe to sit out the movie on his
own, interest reached fever-pitch. The
word, as always, spread back to Timpara,
and Nobby, by way of consolation,
approached Joe and spiritedly denounced
all city-dwellers, with particular refer-
ence to the one staying at Simmo’s place.
“Gripes, no,” said Joe, a little puzzled at
the outburst. “Jenny’s cousin’s all right.
Why, when we was at the pitchers the
other night and Jenny said she felt crook
that cove took her home so that I could
stay and see the show! ”

“Bosun’s Mate”; Bougainville lays
claim to more than natural beauty (B.
2/6/’48). I saw there a display of that
seamanship skill which prompted old Ad-
miral Bougainville, the French navigator,
to name the island the “Isle of Navi-
gators.” The tide was flooding, and across
the bar at Sohana’s harbor-mouth the
rollers were heaving, A speck of black
appeared on the vastness of blue, resolv-
ing into a long canoe oared by six natives.
Standing braced in the stern, hands
grasped round the loom of a long sweep
oar, the helmsman watched his chance.
The wave reared up behind them, he
leaned forward and shouted an order.
Sinewy backs bent and straightened and
the boat shot through the water. An
instant later it was lifted like a cork and
hurled at bullet speed for the beach, a
spurting fan of spray in its teeth. Almost
up to the shore, then the mound of water
collapsed to a smother of foam licking at
the sand, and the boat grated gently
ashore. It had been a tree-trunk, 2ft.
wide.

“Benbow”: “Gravelsnatcher” (B.
12/5/’48) considers that the Koombana
was a “topheavy” ship at the best of
times. There is no such thing. Prior to
construction a vessel’s drawings are care-
fully calculated to ensure positive meta-
centric height, i.e., stability, before she is
laid down. This is done to the satisfaction
of the underwriters and the Board of
Trade. Superstructure of light construc-
tion but impressive appearance often
gives a false impression. The Koom-
bana may have had loose water in her
double-bottom tanks but could not have
had negative stability at the time of her
loss, particularly having part-loaded an
ore cargo. It was seamanlike action to
claw off the land and get to sea with
cyclonic weather approaching.

“C.E.”: Dad flopped into his chair
with a worried frown. “Hanged if I
know,” he puzzled. “The clover isn’t
growing like it should, after all that rain.”
“It’s because the ground is too cold,”
Mum told him, as she dished up the
spuds. “The vegetable garden is like it,
too.” “Don’t be silly,” came the retort.
“Too cold in sunshine like this! Besides,
the perennial grasses are right enough.”
“But they’ve got big roots already,” Mum
pointed out. “It’s the annuals just starting
that it’s too cold for.” Dad dismissed the
suggestion with a what-do-women-know-
about-it snort, and turned to scowl
silently through his meal. He was still
worrying when he met Ben in town. “I
don’t know whether it could be weak
seed,” he remarked. “What’s your grass
like?” “No good,” came the reply. “I’ve
been wondering if the ground wants
manure. Here comes that Chap from the
Agricultural Department—he’ll know.”
They called the expert over, and presented
their trouble. “Why no, it is just the
ground too cold after the heavy rains,”
he explained readily. “You see, the grass
likes a few weeks’ kick-off while the soil
is still warm. The perennials do a bit
better, being already established.” “So
that’s it.” Dad nodded solemnly. “Sounds
reasonable too, once it’s pointed out, only
a man doesn’t think of these things.
Gripes,” he said gratefully, “I’m glad we
met you!”

“Bo”: The boss had told the new hand
to take the dray and bring a load of gravel
from the river, advising him that the best
place to get it was across the stream and
about 100 yards up from the bridge. The
hand asked what he would do if the horse
refused to cross the bridge. The boss
told him to get down and walk it across.
Then he wanted to know what he was to
do if the horse wouldn’t back when he
got it down to the dry river-bed. Thrice
“Two can play at this game!"
more he sought instructions on what was
to be his move if a variety of contin-
gencies were to crop up, to all of which
the boss replied with increasing im-
patience. Finally the hand grudgingly
supposed he might be able to manage it
without undue mishap, but just as he was
about to go he wanted to be told
what to do if Captain couldn’t pull
the load up the bank. The boss
ground his teeth. “Take a blasted
rug down with you!” he barked. The
hand looked at him in wide-eyed surprise.
“What would I use that for?” he asked.
“To wrap yourself in and go to sleep!”
yelled the boss. “Someone might
appear to you in your dream and tell you
what to do! ”

“Alpine Willie”: There are nesting
lyrebirds in this deep, scrubby Victorian
gully, and the male’s song is clear and
ringing. The wizardry of the mimic is
carried through the calls of currawongs,
black cockatoos, coachwhip-birds and
numerous others, plus Menufa’s private
repertoire and a collection of sounds from
the camp. Brownie is much confused
these days. He hears my whistle from
a granite knob 50 yards off and looks up
to see what I mean by it. Having no way
of explaining the mystery to a dog I’ve
got to let him go on believing in my
ventriloquy.

“X.E.D.”: Gongalong is noted for its
wandering stock, best known of which is
Rickson’s house-cow, which combines
the happy knack of insinuating itself
through a five-wire fence with the un-
canny ability of sensing when the owners
of any of the township’s gardens are
likely to be absent. Also celebrated are
Ted Harmer’s efforts to dodge his missus’s
eagle eye and go with the boys for a
couple of drinks at the ->pub opposite,
for she’s a holy terror for days after when
there’s suspicion of Ted’s having had a
beer. Though he had strict instructions to
stay and keep an eye on the place, Ted
took advantage of her absence one Satur-
day afternoon to step over the road for a
quickie. He was headed off on the road
west 40 miles away next morning. “What
else c’d I do?” he grizzled when per-
suaded to return. “She was on’y gorn
half an hour. I did me errand in fifteen
minutes and had time up me sleeve t’
chew a bit of garlic. When I get back I
see by the eaten-orf potplants on the back
v’randah that Rickson’s cow’s bin there.
She’d gone in t’ the kitchen by the open
door, et two loaves o’ bread, knocked
down and trodden on the photer of Uncle
Herb in the livin’-room, wandered into
the bedroom an’ had a go at her reflection
in the big mirror, an’ left by the front
door. Howinell was I goin’t’ explain t
Martha that I hadn’t bin over the road
f’r a beer?”

“Esk D.”: The clouds hang low in
the valley with gloomy and depressing
effect. Outside the small weatherboard
house a fitful drizzle prevails, and the
green-tinged land is saturated and muddy.
Though it is near midday a kerosene
lamp burns in the living-room and the
logs in the fireplace glow with red coals.
At the fire four men are seated in varied
attitudes of comfort. Conversation has
flagged, and there is irritation, written
in their expressions. The quiet is punc-
tuated regularly with a faint plop and
sizzle as old Ned spits in the fire. His
accuracy is unquestionable, which is just
as well for Joe’s stockinged feet toasting
at the side. But it is Tom who takes up
the challenge. “Will y’ stop that blasted
spittin’, Ned!” he roars suddenly. The
changes of expression that flit over Ned’s
dial are worth watching. First it is
shocked surprise, then blank dismay and
rising anger. He gets up without a word
and leaves the room. “Now y’ve done it,”
Harry growls. “We won’t have Ned f’r
the rest o’ the fencin’. Whyn’t y’ leave
him alone?” “Aw, it got on me nerves,”
Tom says. “The old goat’s bin doin’ it
steadily f’r a day an’ a half. I wouldn’t’ve
minded if he’d varied his shots or misfired
an’ hit Joe’s foot occasionally, but it got
too damn monotonous him hittin’ the
target ev’ry time.”

“Goldie”: The blow-off valve on the
air-tank was faulty, the engine ran in fits
and the compressor needed regular atten-
tion. The newchum kept an eye on the
works while Alf handled the jackhammer
underground in the Golden Bell. The air-
tank hadn’t been tested above a doubtful
1201 b. pressure and was kept up to
around 901 b. for working. The gauge
registered up to 1001 b. When Harry came
on the scene the needle was flickering in
the uncharted region above fhe 100 mark
and the newchum was reclining against
an oildrum gazing at the racing engine.
Harry hurriedly switched it off. “Don’t
y’ know them air-tanks burst with enough
force t’ sling y’ fifty yards when they get
over pressure?” he bellowed. “Do y’
want t’ kill y’self? Y’ shouldn’t have
the pressure above the limit o’ the gauge.”
“Aw, she was okay,” the newchum
drawled. “It was on’y the second time
round f’r the needle. Alf said there
wasn’t any need t’ worry till she was
gittin’ past the hundred on the third lap.”

“Bon-yi”: Nearest approach to spring
steel for fishing-rods is the N.Q. ghittoe
or saffron-heart. Better than the famed
greenheart rods, ghittoe improves with
age, and its oily springiness and extremely
tough grain is ideal for the purpose, elas-
ticity not turning to brittleness like other
timbers. Botanically known as Halfordia
scleroxyla, it thrives in the wet, high
Atherton Tablelands. The trees average
about 60ft., with a girth of 50in. to 60in. ;
the timber has been used a lot by district
cockies for firewood and fencing timber,
the logs splitting well and remaining a
long time in the ground as posts. My
first contact with the wood was with an
old abo. on a hunting trip near the Tully
Falls, The scrub was saturated after
weeks of heavy rains, and prospects
of boiling the billy with anything
dry in that sodden, mossy wilderness
of scrub seemed very remote. The
abo. chopped at the fungi-covered log
with a cane-knife, exposing the oily,
saffron-colored solid wood of ghittop,
which burned readily. Queensland
Forestry tests with a fin.-square piece
of wood on supports 3ft. apart stood up
to a weight of 1301 b. to 1501 b. hung from
the centre. It is also excellent for golf-
sticks.

“L.K.E.”: Spotted the old fossicker
with his ear to the largish burrow in the
bank of the alluvial wash. “Ferreting
wombats?” I inquired. “Wombats
nothin’,” he retorted. “But y’ might
call it ferretin’ a bit o’ gold. Y’ see, me
mate’s dead keen on minin’, an’ he’s down
there workin’ a run o’ washdirt f’r our
sluice at the crick.” The underground
rumblings grew louder. A muddy ap-
parition with candle in its hat backed
out dragging a butt of fine gravel, tipped
it on the heap and crawled back in the
hole. “Well, why don’t you cart the
dirt down and sluice it as he gets it out?”
I asked. “That would be more profitable
than waiting around, wouldn’t it?” “Per-
haps,” said the grizzled one. “I useter
when me last mate was alive. That
learned me t’ be careful. There’s more
in ferretin’ gold than meets the eye. I
waited too long to get another decent
ferret to lose him through not bein’ on
the spot t’ dig him out any time the.
bank caves in.”

“Horseless Horseman”; Few bush pubs
give you better value or a better meal
than the little hostelry at Laura, at the
rail terminus of Cape York Peninsula’s
only train, 67 miles west of Cooktown.
At the picturesque, whitewashed, corru-
gated-iron hotel shaded by huge mangoes
we sat down to good broth, roast beef,
fried bananas, sweet potatoes and stewed
fruit, all locally produced—cost half a
crown! Then tea was served with the
kick of a mule. At “The Laura” I was
informed that, despite rationing, they still
drink tea and not colored water! It
takes more than a Chifley to alter customs
in those parts.

“Waddlin’ Willie”: Manuring Vic-
toria’s lakes with superphosphate to grow
giant fish and breeding millions of them
as carefully as racehorses in a £lOO,OOO
research and hatchery programme is only
part of the five-year fishing-investigation
programme facing 33-year-old biologist
A. D. Butcher, Victoria’s chief fishing and
game inspector. As most of his time
is spent out of his office, he knows prac-
tically every fisherman from Gabo to
Port Fairy and frequently goes out to
sea with them. When Professor Wood
called these men “sissy” early this year,
Butcher was the first to defend them and
extracted an apology from the professor
next day. Last summer he spent the
evenings tagging shark in the waters
around Port Phillip, and is now giving 2s.
reward for tags returned. Each is care-
fully recorded, and when more are sent
in he hopes to solve the mystery why
shark-fishermen who made their catches
off the Victorian coast 12 years ago now
have to go 120 miles out to sea.

“Lower Tops’l”; Green, the first-
grazed and only freehold island in the
Furneaux Group, Bass Strait, is surely
the most fertile in the Commonwealth.
Lying only two miles to the westward of
Flinders Island, the low, treeless, grassy
expanse of 250 acres today carries
1000 sheep besides 25 head of cattle all
the year round. And it has done so for
just on 80 years.

“Nepenthes”: As a student of vege-
table convolution “Jemac” (B. 26/5/’4B)
is in good company. Leonardo da Vinci
was one of the earliest on record to be
attracted by plant spirals; three cen-
turies later the industrious Darwin found
time to give them an extensive study.
Later still the great Indian botanist, Sir
Jagadis Bose, gave them his attention.
Heliotropism, or the quest for light,
governs direction in most twiners, but
tendrils can, and do, move indifferently
in any direction, horizontally or up and
down. As I am only up to the first
spiral myself, can any member of the
Council offer a theory for the refusal
of many climbers, quick to shin up shiny
sticks, to twine on glass or smooth metal
rods?
* * * *
“Croweater”: Accustomed to the
strong and continual gully winds of the
Adelaide foothills I had up till recently
regarded an avenue of tall-growing Tas-
manian sugar-gums along my fence as a
potential danger. During recent ferocious
week-end gales only one small low-grow-
ing bough fell to the ground. It was a
different story only a few hundred yards
away. Streets were littered with branches,
large and small, from the wider-spreading
and more massive red-gums. Left to
grow naturally, the Tasmanian sugar-gum
shoots upwards i'n one single, slender,
lofty trunk. Lopped, it simply dupli-
cates the effort. Perfectly blended, their
satiny-grey, fawn and white trunks are
a delight to the eye.

“Old-timer”: I see where a Mt, Gam-
bier (S.A.) shearer has dropped the hand-
piece and moccasins for the scissors,
comb and white overalls of a ladies’
hairdresser, and it sets me wondering
whether or no habit will be his downfall.
Should his scissors accidentally nip a
piece from a dainty ear will hd be able
to resist the instinct to yell “Tar”? Will
he survey the assembled customers, men-
tally decide which is the cobbler and
work to dodge her, and, if called upon
to reduce some luxuriant locks to an Eton
bob or wljat passes for it these days,
can he control himself sufficiently to
refrain from shouting, “Wool away, an’
jump back quick ; I hate the smell of
rouseabouts”? It will certainly be a new
experience to have the shorn com-
menting on the quality of his shearing,
and, if they do, he won’t be able to
blame the expert for the state of the
combs and cutters. But what of the day
when, his mind in the past, he finishes off
some skittish young ewe, whirls her from
the chair, points her head for the door
and with a firm hand on her rear propels
her “down the chute” and cries, “Gripes,
more burr an’ sand than a Wilcannia
billygoat! ”

“Zake”; The whiskered old hatter was
sitting in the sun,, his back against the
slab walls of his entirely roofless hut,
reading a tattered book. “Short of bark
hereabouts to* roof it?” I asked. He
looked up and thought for about half a
minute. “No,” he replied. “Plenty o’
stringy around. Just can’t be bothered.”
“But how do you get on when it rains?”
I asked. He screwed his eyes up against
the sun. “Look,” he said, “the only time
it ever rains around these parts it comes
down properly. Then the crick here” —
he pointed to the creek a few yards away
—“comes down a banker. When that
’appens I got to shift to a holler log up
on ’igh ground. So wot’s the flamin’
use of havin’ a roof on me kipsy, any-
way?,”
“I wish you Wouldn't he quite so impetuous when you hear the dinner-
gong, Mr. Stephens!”
“Salmon Gums”: The discovery of
gold near Kendenup, in the lower sou’-
west W.A., has revived the old claim
that you could expect to find some gold
almost anywhere in the Big State. It
seems to be pretty well distributed, and
while Golden Miles are not scattered
around indiscriminately, some well-worth-
while finds have been recorded at unlikely
spots. The first gold discovery in W.A. —
yes, before the Kimberleys—was near
Kununoppin, now a thriving wheatbelt
district in which no one would seek gold
below the ground. As early as the late
’6o’s Kendenup yielded some rich ore.
A creek out from Toodyay, some 60
miles from Perth, is visited each winter
by alluvial seekers, and some shafts near
the creek show promise. As a lad I heard
tales of an old convict who was allowed
some freedom. Every now and again
he would cross the river at Guildford and
vanish for a few weeks. He always
returned with a few ounces. If he didn’t
get it from the alluvial workings near
Toodyay there’s anothen-rich find waiting
to be stumbled on, ;
* * * *
“Blime”: The news spread over the
district, reaching old Bob on his back-
creek holding. “Y’ know that pasture
bloke that’s been stationed in town these
last coupla years, Bob?” the mailman
yelled at him. “Well, he’s cornin’ out
this way t’morrer t’ give a lesson in
Wilson’s paddock on how t’ get rid o’ y’r
weed pests.” Bob came to life enthusias-
tically, and next day, armed with a liberal
sample of his particular trials, he became
one of the crowd in Wilson’s paddock.
“Now take horehound,” boomed the
visitor. “I find most people favor cutting
and burning. And this red grass. Mr.
Wilson tells me he uses super, on it and I
agree it’s a good thing to do.” “What
we want to know is how to get rid o’
this here peppercress,” called Bob eagerly,
“It’s smqtherin’ all our best paddocks.”
“Peppercress?” The visitor inspected the
exhibit with a puzzled frown. “Can’t say
I’ve seen it before,” he murmured. “What
have you done to combat it?” One after
the other, the locals explained at length
of unsuccessful ploughing, cutting, burn-
ing, grubbing and attempted poisoning.
“Yes, yes, very interesting,” agreed the
expert. “I would certainly advise con-
tinuance along those lines. And now
before I go, is there anything else anyone
wants help with?”

“Nubis”: Fifteen years ago, when Jim
was the proud owner of one cow, he was
wont to say “Nice bag old Strawb’s got.”
Ten years later, when he had a good
grade herd, he'said “Beautiful udder on
ol’ Diamantina.” A few weeks ago he
invited me over to inspect his herd of
pure-bred Jerseys, and I remarked on one
fine beast. “Yes,” said Jim, “that’s Jardine
Princess Royal the Fourth. Note the per-
fect balance of her vessel! ”

“Alec”: Reclining on the verandah
of a country homestead, I noticed a
slight disturbance among a patch of tall-
growing and full-flowering Madonna-
lilies, obviously not caused by the breeze.
Investigating, I found a brown snake
taking his fill from the calyx of a wide-
open flower. I killed it. A few days later
there was a repeat performance; this
time another brown selected an attrac-
tive pink hollyhock and began imbibing.
Is this usual?

“The Pirate”: News that the crew of
the Flinders Island trader Loatta won’t
man the ketch and that request has been
made by the islanders for a freight-plane
service recalls that air-transport is already
rivalling shipping to these lonely Bass
Strait islands Whitemark, the strange
little capital, is now served tri-weekly by
a mail and passenger plane from Launces-
ton, while a “crayfish bomber” also regu-
larly picks up fish there for Melbourne’s
Mostly these' days crays are
caught in small boats by resident families
instead of from fishing ketches. The
Wheatleys—a family of five—who live
in the shadow of bald-faced Mt. Killie-
crankie on the northern shore, caught in
one year 2500 crays. “The Bomber” en
route flies over these outposts to learn, by
means of blanket-signalling, of catches. A
red cloth spread on the grass means
“ That's better—I Was nearly frozen out there holding that hose!”
“catch ready tomorrow,” and so on. In
recent years, because the Loatta has
mostly worked only the all-weather port
of Lady Barron, a distance of more than
40 miles from some holdings, a syndicate
of farmers on Flinders last month
launched a new 67-ton ketch of their own
at Port Cygnet (Tas.) to serve northern
outposts and beaches. Bill Dunn, a
veteran among Strait sailing-ship salts,
last week left his job as mate of the
sailer Argonaut to take command.

“Gravelsnatcher”; There’s a scientific
explanation for the clockwise rotation of
cyclones in the southern hemisphere. A
cyclone is caused by air rushing into a
low-pressure area. The air moving from
the north coming from a faster-moving
portion of the earth’s surface overshoots
the mark and is drawn back in a circular
motion. That from the slower-moving
south lags behind and is drawn forward,
also circularly. This applies to air from
every direction except due east and west,
so the circle is completed. In the northern
hemisphere the position is reversed —
the south is the faster-moving area —
so anti-clockwise cyclones prevail. But
I think ftie theory breaks down when
applied to water gurgling out of a bath.

“G’roper”: Maybe it is as “8.A.K.”
says with regard to sparrows (B. 19/5/’4B),
but I know that magpies will kill any of
their own kind that has submitted to the
protection of man. Knowing many of
the habits of the pied birds I one day
captured a young one just past the nest-
ling stage and learning to fly. Such birds
may be identified by their lacklustre
plumage: it is the older birds that
display the sharp contrast of black and
white. Taken to the ground in the pro-
cess of learning to fly, these young ones
may sometimes be caught by hand. Mine
I reared until we both were on the friend-
liest of terms. On my quarter-acre fenced
with 6ft. netting Maggie had sanctuary.
But she was often menaced, and
occasionally attacked. All around were
wild bush magpies, and at certain times
they made a concentrated thrust at my
garden, with clamor and much alarmed
squarking from Maggie. But they wouldn’t
venture too much into the enclosure.
Nor would Maggie spread wings to fly
out. Then one day the gate was left open
and she wandered out. Her enemies were
watching. Inside half a minute a dozen
had arrived, had startled her into flight,
heading her with much clamor to the
nearby bush, diving at her savagely all
the way. I found her later, featherless,
bleeding and dead.

“C.A.L.”; “I hear you want a dray-
man,” the prospect said to Sampson, the
road contractor. “Yes, the job is yours
if you can drive straight,” Sampson
replied. “I sacked the last bloke because
he couldn’t. For a long time it had me
tricked why the road formations didn’t
look quite level. Then one say I spotted
him run the wheel of the dray over one
of the pegs, knocking it a bit further
into the ground. Fired him on the spot
when I saw him do this, as I didn't
want my roads uneven. They were only
out of plumb about an inch in a quarter
of a mile, but still I could see with my
eye that they weren’t level!”
“Sou’-west”: My mate had a habit of
dumping hjg duds on to the earth floor
of the tent when crawling into bunk,
Rising one morning, the tent being
pitched on a limestone surface, he had
the fortunate thought to give his pants a
preliminary shake before diving his legs
into their recesses. Out dropped a four-
inch, nearly-black scorpion. Full of fight
at being disturbed it sparred up at the
cobber’s bare feet. From the blucher he
hoisted to settle its hash dropped the twin
of the black demon on the floor. At the
sight of each other both instantly sparred
up, claws elevated, tail with its vicious
sting brought high over and along the
back ; on the tip of each sting a minute
droplet of venom glistened. It looked
like being a ding-dong go. But nothing
happened until the mate, tired of watch-
ing shadow-sparring, deftly swept both
into an empty kero.-tin. Instantly, find-
ing themselves imprisoned, both flew into
a rage, grappling like a pair of wrestlers.
Inside a few minutes both had stung each
other to death.

“C.A.L.”: Twenty years ago a strug-
gling cocky married a well-to-do squat-
ter’s daughter, and today he is one of the
wealthiest graziers of central-western
N.S.W. During a recent shearing at one
of his stations he sacked a man; but the
wife, seeing the shearer walking to the
office to get his cheque, stopped him.
He told her that he had been
“tramped,” and added for her sym-
pathetic ear that he was a married
man with a large family. “Go straight
back to your stand and tell my husband
that you are shearing for me now,” she
ordered, adding “It was my money that
put him where he is today.” Resuming
work, he was questioned by the boss.
“I’m shearing for your wife, not
you,” he retorted. The boss walked away
and said no more about it during the
shearing. At the “cut-out” the shearer
lined up for his pay with the rest.
“Don’t know you,” said the boss, briefly.
“You’re on the wife’s payroll. Get it
from her! ” It was too late to start a
strike.

“Jemac”; Those turpentine steps in
“Macnell’s” Man o’ War Steps (B.
9/6/’4B) are of a wood with durability
unequalled forwharf-piling and shipbuild-
ing. The turpentine-tree, endemic to
eastern Australia, is rung well before fel-
ling, which shrinks its bark in a tight pro-
tective cylinder, and logs are carefully
snigged to keep the bark undamaged.
The pile is driven with bark on, and a
layer of resin beneath it effectively balks
the teredo. For a borer that treats copper
sheathing like cheese that is protection.
Fire will only char turpentine, and before
concrete replaced wood to a large extent
in warehouses it was used extensively for
beams and timbers. Exported all over the
world, from Tokyo to Valparaiso,
greatest demand was in the Thames.
Here miles of wharves stand on Australian
turpentine legs.

“W.T.E.EStray dogs had become
a nuisance in the town, and the local-gov-
erning bodies had decided to declare war
on all unregistered tykes. Unaware of
the ukase, Vic was strolling up the main
street, his kelpie at his heels, when the
cop bore down on him. In answer to the
constabulary catechism Vic deponed .that
he had registered Tiger only the week be-
fore ; that the kelpie had recently won
a medal, which he had affixed to the
dog’s collar. The law looked down. “I
can’t see any collar on him,” he grunted.
“Well,” said Vic, thinking fast. “Lemme
see, what’s today, Monday. Yair, that’s
it—it’s in the wash!”
TRAIN WHISTLE.
♦
You’re travelling the country
In a secluded spot,
The stumps and trees the only
Bright company you’ve got;
All day you’ve seen no traffic,
-You’re sick of trees and crows,
But it doesn’t seem so lonely
When the train’s shrill whistle blows.
You’re camped in bushland silent,
‘ Your mate has left you flat,
You’re talking to the rabbits,
You’re raving to your hat;
There’s not a sound about you,
The silence sort of grows;
But you start to feel quite human.
When the train’s loud whistle blows.
You’re sitting in your humpy
Or in a lonely house,
With not a soul to talk to
Bar dog or bat or mouse ;
And then you hear it blowing,
As through the bush it goes;
You feel there’s someone with you
When the train’s deep whistle blows.
By roads and quiet places,
By flat and plain and hill,
Whenever man feels lonely
' And talk is standing still,
It’s good to hear the whistle
For in a way it shows
You’re still among your people
When the train’s far whistle blows.

TH E MAN ON THE LAND
"DON'T WO RRY, I'M SENDING IT OT GRAZCOS."
SYDNEY SHEEP SHOW
“Bungaree”: There were over
450 Merinos, and their general
quality was very high. “Tail”
was less evident than usual; tops
included some of the classiest
sheep seen in Sydney. For the
first time there were classes for
polled Merino rams, and
although their quality was a long
way below the show standard of
the horned rams there is no
doubt that they will become
popular.
Soaring prices of fine and
superfine wools should have en-
couraged strong representation
of those types at the show, but
it was not so. Superfine classes
were very small, and after some
were relegated to the fine wools
they were smaller still. Once
again Merryville stud did particu-
larly well and won both ram and
ewe championships and reserves.
In fine wools competition was
better. There was some diver-
sity of opinion regarding type
among breeders; in fact, ram
championship and reserve rib-
bons went to Tuwinga for sheep
originally entered in the super-
fine section. This stud, practi-
cally a newcomer to Sydney, did
remarkably well. The Eshcol
ewe champion is rising four and
was particularly well covered.
Medium wools produced some
of the best classes ever seen in
Sydney and competition was
keen. A feature was the success
of comparative newcomers, and
the quality of their sheep was a
revelation. Kirkby Pastoral
Company have been building a
high reputation at shows in
north-west N.S.W. for a number
of years and their success was
merited. Another newcomer
from the Moree district —Yumoo
—made an impressive first ap-
pearance in the company of such
well-known studs as Mungadal,
Raby, Burrabogie and Bunde-
mar. Merryville collected top
honors for rams and Eshcol top
honors for ewes, both studs being
hitherto regarded as fine and
superfine breeders. The Merry-
ville ram went on to become
grand champion against strong
competition. He is a particu-
larly fine sheep big-framed,
very deep and plain-bodied, with
a beautiful head and front and
a dense, long-stapled fleece of
typical 64’s, even in quality
throughout.. The Eshcol ewe
is a beautiful animal, and in the
final line-up for superfine honors
won reserve grand-champion
ribbon.
Strong wools were particularly
good, and awards were widely
distributed. Plain bodies, big
frames and density of covering
were apparent. Ram ribbons
went to Rangari, Mungadal,
Bibbenluke, Merryville, Uardry,
Mullengudgery, Dalkeith,
Kirkby, Raby and Somerset.
Champion was a big-framed
Mullengudgery ram, Mungadal
showing the reserve. The ewes
were of consistent high quality,
and a surprise champion was a
ewe from Somerset (Jerilderie),
practically a newcomer to the
open classes. She became grand
champion and is a big-framed
ewe, barely two years old, with a
long-stapled even covering of
lustrous 60’s.
Extra-strongs were patchy and,
although their wool was defined,
as “60’s or less,” some of it was
mighty close to straightout
crossbred. The tops, however,
were full of quality. A ram
from Stradbroke (S.A.) was
champion, the reserve was from
the Kirkbys, who also won the
ewe championship.
Judging of the Merino grand
championships brought a sur-
prise reserve ram champion
from Mungadal, a big, stylish
ram, deep-bodied and wide in
the thigh with a densely-packed
60’s fleece, produced from a pen
of five to beat the strong chal-
lenge of section champions and
reserves.
Competition was limited in
novice classes, particularly in
fine wools. Ewe classes were
better all round than rams;
Yumoo did remarkably well and
won ram and ewe champion-
ships and ewe reserve. Small-
graziers’ section deserves better
support, though the small man
seldom has time or opportunity
to prepare sheep for show.
Somerset stud did well, particu-
larly in the ewe classes, and
Murlingbung won ram cham-
pionship and reserve. • Merry-
ville’s group of three rams and
two ewes won the Stonehaven
Cup. A notable feature of the
big line-up was the insistence of
all breeders on plain bodies.
Mungadal and Tuwinga were
runners-up. Merryville was most
successful exhibitor in the
Merino section.
Corriedales and Polwarths.
Corriedale entries were more
and better. Sheep varied in size
and covering according to the
districts they were bred in, but
there was less tail than usual.
Gundowringa had a magnificent
team and won ram championship
and reserve. The champion’s
fleece was densely packed on, of
wonderful length and staple
formation, soft handling, very
even in quality and full of char-
acter. Reserve ram was very
deep and thick through and par-
ticularly good on the points, but
his fleece lacked the bright, even
color of his studmate. A Eurella
ewe beat Killamey’s 1947 cham-
pion. • There was very little be-
tween them, both being hard to
fault either in conformation or
covering. They handled particu-
larly well and carried themselves
with lots of style.
There was less variety in
fleeces than in the past. Some
fined up to 56’s and a larger
proportion were on the strong
side of 50’s. Discoloration of
fleeces, stariness and poor staple
formation were to be found, but
on the whole breeders had every
reason to be proud of their
sheep. Other prizewinners in-
cluded Redbank, Old Redbank,
Rocky Ridge and Beulah.
Polwarths were not so strongly
represented, no Victorians being
present. Champion ram, shown
by J.E. and T. Jelbart, embodied
ideal Polwarth characteristics in
conformation and covering. Ewe
championship went to another
third year in succession, Law-
rence’s ewe in reserve.
Southdown entries showed a
considerable increase, apparently
due to the revival of export lamb
raising. Two Victorian studs
did very well, Letts Stud eventu-
ally coming out as most success-
ful exhibitor. The Brunskill
Southdowps were hard to beat,
particularly on the male side, and
won ram championship and re-
serve, while Letts won the cor-
responding ewe championships.
The increased popularity of
Dorset Horns was evident. The
Dawkins sheep from S.A. re-
peated their triumphs of previ-
ous years and won both male
and female championships. Re-
serve ram was bred at Lindsbury
and reserve ewe at Broughton
Brook. There was very little
tail in any of the classes.
The Ryeland section was
almost a walk-over for Patrician
Stud. These big-framed, chunky
Downs sheep are not nearly so
well known as they deserve to be.
The Fleeces.
“Murrawong”: N.S.W., which
pastures more than half the
“ Yoohoo — smoke-oh !”
Jelbart —F. E. —for a neat com-
pact animal. Both reserves went
to A. J. Kendall.
British Breeds.
“J.R.D.”: Romney entries
were fewer but their quality was
excellent. The Glasson sheep
were missing, but the breed was
ably represented by Tertandra
Park, Milton, Curraweela, Teas-
dale Park and Chatsbury. The
first-nqmed was most successful
exhibitor, and Milton won cham-
pion ram and both reserve
honors with a very strong team.
Champion ewe came from Teas-
dale Park. Some sheep were
not quite up to standard as re-
gards covering and were inclined
to be harsh and coarse to handle.
Border-Leicesters showed large
classes, keen competition and
high all-round quality. Victoria
was represented by Kelso Park,
Barford and Bonnie Dooh.
N.S.W. breeders were in force.
Most successful competitor was
C. Squire, of Bumbaldry, ex-
hibiting in Sydney for the first
time. The sheep were more of
a type, fewer bearing the stamp
of fashions prevailing in other
parts of the world ; there is still
a lot of leg, but each year they
are gradually being brought
closer to the ground. Kelso won
the ram championship and W.
Lawrence the reserve. Kelval
had the ewe champion for the
sheep in Australia and which
claims that its Sydney sheep
show is the biggest and
best, can still attract only 30
fleece entries. Many suggestions
have been made, here and else-
where, with a view to making the
fleece section as important and
as representative as the sheep
classes, but little or nothing has
been done, and one can only
commend the public-spiritedness
of the handful of woolgrowers
who made up the exhibit.
The judges had more ribbons
to bestow than fleeces to put
them on, and anything that
didn’t get a championship was a
poor type of fleece. The general
standard was decidedly poor,
and, with the exception of two
or three fleeces that were really
good, the display was disappoint-
ing. Many entries looked like
the survivors of country shows,
and had been pulled about so
much that it was very difficult to
show them to advantage.
Merryville collected most of
the awards. Grand champion
fleece, (ewe or wether) came from
the medium-wool section, and
was on the fine side of 64’s, but
was nevertheless a beautiful
fleece with good length of staple,
good character throughout and
plenty of bulk. The judges’
standards appeared to be on the
fine side; one exhibit awarded
strong-wool championship was
on appearance an average
medium type leaning towards
66’s.
The Corriedale section was
represented by two fleeces, one
of which could not have found
a place in the top line of an
average XB clip and certainly
should never have been sent to
a show. Although the sole entry
in its class, the judges refused to
award a blue ribbon, but gave
it a second prize.
Something must be done to
“pep-up” the fleece competitions.
Sydney sheep show attracts
visitors, and publicity men who
retail the highlights to the rest
of the world, yet scores of
country shows have fleece sec-
tions that knock Sydney’s dis-
play bandy. The show fleeces
should be truly representative in
quality and quantity of the lar-
gest wool-producing State in the
most important wool-producing
country in the world; at present
they mean nothing.
Value of Shows.
“Ayrshire”: While the re-
marks of “Waver” (B. 19/5/’4B)
are true, the implications which
he draws are false. A prize-
winning dairy bull is most likely
a worthy animal because the
ribbon has been given to him
by an expert who certifies that
out of the bulls shown he is the
nearest approach to a perfect
animal. Admittedly the breed-
ing test is the most important
one, but the buyer of a young
stud animal cannot wait until he
has been bred from and his
female progeny have proved
themselves at the milk-pail. Still
less can he wait to see how the
progeny of the bull’s sons turn
out.
A show is not “chiefly a place
where farmers may gather for
discussion.” It is of great eco-
nomic importance to the dairy-
ing industry. Its function is to
keep the breed up to standard in
type, constitution and appear-
ance. All of these qualities in-
directly “go into the milk-pail.”
All of them are of great import-
ance in the progress of the
breed.
Rigging the Engine.
“Oiler”: While it may be
satisfactory sometimes to retain
gearbox and clutch in the set-
up of a car motor as a stationary
engine, it doesn’t follow that the
practice should be considered

Architect’s plan for
Sydney Hotel . . . Mudgee.
Planning
for Tomorrow
TOOTH’S PRE-WAR RECONSTRUCTION
POLICY resulted in the modernisation of
many hotels throughout New South Wales.
During the war this programme had to be
greatly curtailed, and it cannot be resumed
until the urgent need for homes has been met.
However, Tooths are planning now for the
future, and the illustration here shows the
design for rebuilding the “Sydney” Hotel at
Mudgee. This is one of many examples of
the programme to improve hotel facilities
that will be implemented as soon as materials
and labour are available.
TOOTH I CO.LIMITED.
SYDNEY
Makers of good beer since 1835
generally the best. There are
several good reasons why it is
usually better to discard these
parts, even though it may be
found easier to rig the engine
with the assemblies intact.
In the first place, the shaft
with fixed and loose pulleys is
much less complex than gearbox
and clutch and should never
wear out or need replacements.
Anyone who bothered to work
out the ratios in the various
gears from engine back-wheels
of a car would quickly see how
mechanically unsound it is driv-
ing from the tailshaft in first or
second gear. Undue stresses are
likely to cause most gearboxes
and clutches to crack-up in a
very short time. In most cars
past their road life that have
been put to work as casual units
gearboxes and clutches are
then far from perfect and re-
placements aren’t warrantable.
It isn’t recommended that car
engines should be used in place
of other types for constant work.
Rather are they more suited to
casual or emergency power for
pumping, chaffcutting, etc.,
where the initial cost of recon-
ditioning and fitting the heart-
and-lungs of the old, discarded
flivver is much less than the
price of a stationary engine of
equivalent horsepower.
Hints for the Farm.
“C.A.A.”: Except in districts
subject to heavy frosts most trees
will thrive if planted during early
winter months. In frost-suscep-
tible areas delay until late winter
or spring. For permanent plant-
ing select trees 6in. to 12in. high
having sturdy tops and stems
and an abundance of fibrous
roots. Use larger ones on land
where there is much weed
growth and smaller plants in ex-
posed situations. Don’t plant
trees where water lies. Young
trees must be protected from
stock.
“Bumble”; Take advantage
of bleak, cloudy days for clean-
ing-up around beehives. If the
bees are disturbed an angry
knot of them hangs out at the
entrance ready for fight, but
this can be avoided by quietly
stuffing the entrance with paper
beforehand. Chip the grass
away from the boxes with a
hoe and straighten those that
have become shifted from an
even keel. Weeds and grass
allowed to grow unchecked pro-
vide harbor for numerous pests,
as well as promoting damp con-
ditions and forcing the workers
to battle through wet foliage on
dewy mornings and after rain.
“Sarina”: C.S.I.R. has been
looking for a good legume for
North Queensland grazing lands,
sadly deficient in protein-rich
herbage. Puero, a relative of
Japan’s kudzu vine, has given
promise of mixing satisfactorily
with Para grass in tests at South
Johnstone. Townsville lucerne
(a legume) is well distributed
through the north, but it does
not grow well with strong grasses,
keeping to areas where the
grasses are grazed very short,
or where the soil is poor.
“Bill C.”: Rotational grazing
of pastures brings weed
problems. The shorter any grass
is kept the more nutritious it is
to stock grazing on it, but the
more vulnerable it is to weeds.
Weeds ignored by stock soon
spread through short pasture
and gradually beat it. There are
always weed-seeds in the ground
ready to grow at the first chance,
but many weeds are established
on new territory when new
horses or cattle are introduced.
Get rid of weeds before they can
seed. One paddock with weeds
in seed this year means a weedy
farm next year, for moving stock
from paddock to paddock broad-
casts seed everywhere.
“Malo”: To prevent second
growth in potatoes make sure
that there are plenty of eyes
left in the seed when cutting.
Contrary to general belief,
numerous stalks are necessary
for a heavy crop. The strongest
and healthiest single stalk will
produce only one or two tubers,
which are likely to be spoilt by
second growth should rain fall
when they are ready for digging.
“Bai”: Broken, rocky and
scalded land should not be
allowed to remain a wilderness,
but should be reclaimed and
beautified by tjie planting of
trees and shrubs. The former
will be valuable when grown, and
the latter will help to hold the
soil together and prevent it
flooding away during heavy
rains. Both will add to the land’s
value.
“W. Court”: When repairing
a punctured or blown-out bicycle
tube use car-tube patching. It
makes the repair more lasting
and does not affect the position
of the tube in the tyre.

“Although Sydney’s City Council
aldermen are unlikely to wear Court
dress for the Royal visit, the Health
Committee is considering designs for
brighter street fruit-barrows; they
will have metal and glass fittings and
colored awnings.”
It had been the biggest sensa-
tion in Foveaux-street since
the night old Joe Skinner had
come home dead sober.
Residents stepping out on to
the footpath from their front-
doors had stopped popeyed at
sight of ’Arry the Dill’s new
fruit-barrow. Painted red, white
and blue, one end was enclosed
with louvred windows to keep
out the blowflies. The roof
carried guttering and downpipe,
and awnings in tasteful ox-blood
and canary-yellow sprouted
from three sides. On the inside
uprights were two vasefuls of
pansies, and lilac satin draped
the side which would face the
gutter. On the end was his
silvered monogram and ’Arry’s
personal crest, two half-crowns,
which he maintained equalled a
crown.
’Arry’s eruption from his men-
age created an even greater sen-
sation. He wore the new regu-
lation clobber prescribed by the
Health Committee: Grey egg-
boiler, red-and-green striped
football guernsey, draughtboard-
checked morning-coat and grey-
striped trousers, Army-disposal
boots, lavender gloves, spats and
silver-handled malacca dog-
walloper. In his buttonhole was
an outsize in pansies.
At the markets, perambula-
tion to which place developed
for the Foveaux-street hero into
a triumphal procession, itself
almost of Royal proportions,
’Arry, fixing the louvred win-
dows so they would allow a
breeze but no dust to blow on
his wares, filled up with oranges
and bananas. As a special ges-
ture to his clients to mark the
Royal visit he put all the large
ones at the back, from where he
would be serving, placing all the
small, bruised ones in the front
“Awfully sorry —I thought it was the ashtray !”
to face the customers on the
footpath.
What looked like a peripatetic
Christmas-tree being pushed
along at first staggered the
traffic-cop at the Haymarket;
then he left the traffic to tangle
itself up a bit more and came
over to speak in terms which at
once proclaimed he had been a
former member 4 of the Traffic
Courtesy Squad.
“What’s the meaning of this! ”
he barked out of the slit at the
side of his mouth. “This isn’t
an undergrads’ procession. Who
the hell gave you permission to
push that thingamegig around,
or to get around dolled up like
a sore whatjamacallit?”
’Arry put down his barrow,
drew himself down to his full
sft. 4in., fastidiously flicked a
speck of imaginary dust from his
sleeve, and, gazing coldly at the
' cop, spoke —but not like the
old ’Arry, for he had been to
the special elocution-class pro-
vided by the City Fathers against
the imminent Royal visit.
“I happen,” he said haughtily,
“to be legitimately engaged in
the vending of those comestibles
which your indubitable powers
of perception will have informed
you are stacked with mathemati-
cal precision on this movable
platform which I was propelling
towards my chosen rendezvous
with the general public until
your oral crudeness placed a
hiatus on my progress.”
The cop looked puzzled for a
moment or two; then light
dawned on him. “Oh, a barrow-
tman, eh? Where’s your stand?”
he demanded.
“Its location,” replied ’Arry
gently, “is at the intersection of
Darling Harbor, the Observatory
and Centennial Park. Now with
your gracious constabulary per-
mission I will proceed.” He
raised an arm. “ ‘Charge, Chester,
charge! On, Stanley, on! ’” he
declaimed, then took up the
shafts and pushed past the still-
dazed cop.
Later that morning, just after
he had finished sadly rubbing
himself down after a hefty
woman had squeezed a bit too
hard on an orange she was test-
ing for soundness, ’Arry let down
a collapsible board attached to
one end of his barrow. On this
he set out shaving-mug, brush
and soap, and was busy strop-
ping a cut-throat razor when a
City Council Health Inspector
came along.
“Put that away!” he ordered
peremptorily. “You ought to
know licensed barrowmen aren’t
allowed to shave themselves in
public alongside their fruit—it
isn’t hygienic. I’ve a good mind
to”
A pained look lit on ’Arry’s
already perfectly-shaven face,
and deep emotion wrought on
him so much that not only did
his Ronald Colman moustache
twitch but temporarily he lapsed
into his pre-Royal-visit jargon.
“Strike me roan!” he began.
“Me china-plate’ll be lobbin’
along any tick”—then, remem-
bering his new status and what
was expected of him, he checked
himself. “I am expecting,
shortly,” he began again, “my
esteemed colleague with several
cases of gooseberries. Patently
it would be unseemly to have
Their Majesties’ eyes offended,
should they come past my place
of business, with the sight of
gooseberries with a horrible
stubble still over them. It is
them I am preparing to shave!”

THE OTHER FELLOW'S MIND

4£d. per line; all others 2|d. per line.
Counting the Costs
In all the talk on “price-control” too
much emphasis has been placed on the
effect (price) and far too little on the
cause (costs). Prices are far too high for
our incomes, but “price-control” implies
that prices are out of all reasonable pro-
portion to costs. That, definitely, is not
the case. Prices (except blackmarket
prices) are high only because costs are
high, so that “cost-control” should be
receiving even more attention than price-
control. And those who should be most
actively interested are the workers them-
selves.
In the final analysis, costs represent
“output per man-hour.” The family
breadwinner should be able to exchange
his wages for 40 man-hours of produc-
tion of goods and services each week. If
he can do that, he is well off. But he can
do it only if he, with every other worker,
including employers, is giving 40 pro-
ductive hours per week.
If some workers are giving only 20 pro-
ductive hours per,week while being paid
for 40, then they, and all their kind, are
simply reducing the real value of wages.
The breadwinner, who needs the output
of 40 productive hours per week, is actu-
ally receiving considerably less than 40,
and so his standard of living is lowered.
Consider a few examples:
In December last, the N.S.W. Railways
announced that the reduction of hours
from 44 to 40 per week had resulted in
output per man falling by 35 per cent.
Elementary arithmetic shows that if re-
duction of hours by four caused a drop
of 35 per cent., then the number of pro-
ductive hours in 44 must have been 12,
reduced to eight in the 40-hour-week.
Fantastic, but that is the only possible
interpretation. It emphasises how small
a proportion of the time spent “at work”
is really productive, and explains why
our standard of living is low.
This is not the only case—it is common
knowledge that it now takes two
men to do what was done by one before
the war.
Another illustration: The Metro-
politan Water Bpard recently estimated
the cost of fibre cottages at Warragamba
to be in the vicinity of £2OOO, say £2150
with land. That, or better, is a type of
house which should be the right of every
working man. But consider the annual
charges:
Capital value .. ».. .. £2150
Interest, say, 3 p.c £64 10 0
Depreciation, say, 5 p.c. on £2OOO 100 0 0
Repairs and painting 15 0 0
Rates and taxes 15 00
Total annual charges £194 10 0
or £3 15s. a week. Obviously beyond
the means of the average man.
But, if we could revfirt to our pre-war
standard of working, that house could be
built for half the cost, repairs and paint-
ing could be done for half the cost, and
rates and taxes could be reduced, so that
the weekly charge would come down to
something like £2 and thus within the
reach of the working man. That, surely,
would be an improvement in his standard
of living.
One final disturbing matter which must
receive constructive attention is the
tremendous turnover of labor and the
tremendous loss of production it involves.
On my own particular construction job,
the annual turnover is 800 per cent., and
conversations with other engineers on
similar work confirm that figure as an
average. On one important construction
project in Sydney the average number of
men on the job over the last three years
has been 200. Of those, about 100 have
been “permanent.” To provide the other
100 3600 men have passed through the
job—a labor turnover of 1200 per cent,
a year.
Two facts are important in seeking the
cause of this tremendous turnover. First,
no employer willingly loses a man who
does a fair day’s work, and, second, the
majority of these itinerant employees
leave the jobs of their own volition —
usually when required to do a reasonable
day’s work. They pass on to one of the
hundreds of jobs hungry for men and last
a week or so there. And so they circulate,
lasting a lazy week or so oA each job and,
in effect, doing as much as any man can
to lower the standard of living for the
community in general. It is a. tragic fact
that the majority in this categoiy are
young men.
The workers must be educated to the
knowledge that they have a responsibility
to their fellow-workers to do a full day’s
W'ork. The best way of educating them
would be for union officials to regard
them as “scabs” and for their fellow-
workers to recognise them as “bludgers”
and treat them as such were treated in
the Army.—K. M. C. (N.S.W.).
Melbourne
There is something crazy about the
development of Melbourne. Paris is a
small city that has been built upwards.
It contains a large population who
live, work and eat in its confines, and
it is surrounded by farms which provide
it with subsistence. Melbourne is a very
small city surrounded by a vast sea of
suburbs composed of exclusive little units
of husband, wife and family in separate
little houses.
Scarcely anybody lives in the city
proper—it’s regarded almost as a sin to
do so. Nine-tenths of the population gets
into trams, trains and buses and cars and
converges on the city every morning,
rushes out of it for dinner and then
scrambles back to look at Vivien Leigh
or Betty Grable. It is like a vast ebbing
and flowing tide trying to get into a
bottle.
Melbourne obviously should grow up-
wards and become residential like Paris,
“The matron said We Were the image of the old man. Wouldn't it ?”
but anybody who made this suggestion
would be up against the prejudices of'
wowsers who regard Hell as a city much
like Paris.
The other day the City Council took
a moment or two off to discuss
the town-planning of the future, and
it was proposed that the Board of Works
should be made the town-planning
authority. The Board of Works! It has
already ruined the Yarra with its schemes
of “beautification,” and it has put the
upper part of the river out of commission
by building bridges so low that it can’t
get its own dredges under them. So the
river is steadily silting up, and will soon
provide the space for the car-park which
is so urgently needed.
The planning of a city is not merely a
problem of engineering ; it is an aesthetic
problem, and it would be interesting to
know what the B. of W. has learnt about
aesthetics from making sewers and build-
ing little bridges which are menaces to
traffic as well as ugly.—M. G. S. (Vic.).
The South Coast
For years the far South Coast of
N. S. Wales has been deprived of a rail-
way on the ground that it is too difficult
and expensive to bridge the Shoalhaven
River. The Shoalhaven is a mere creek
compared with the Hawkesbury, and the
North Coast railway crosses not only the
Hawkesbury, but the Hunter, Manning,
Hastings, Macleay, Clarence and Rich-
mond. :
Years ago Sir Henry Parkes promised
a railway right down the coast and
on to Melbourne, and an extension
of the Monaro line from Cooma
to link up with it at Wolumla,
just south of Bega. So optimistic were the
local people that the hotel at Wolumla
was named the Railway Junction Hotel.
That was over 50 years ago. The name
of the hotel has since been changed to
the Wolumla.
Twofold Bay is regarded as the second-
best port in N. S. Wales, but it is little
used, and the town of Eden is barely more
than a hamlet, instead of being the busy
coastal city it should be. Not only could
Eden become a great port for the direct
shipping of wool, wheat and other pro-
ducts from Southern Monaro, but it could
be made the centre of newsprint, timber,
whaling, fishing and canning industries.
Given a railway line the South Coast
would carry a much greater population ;
farrps could be subdivided to produce a
maximum instead of a minimum as at
present.
Some years ago the far South Coast
people felt so neglected that there was a
move to form a separate State. A similar
agitation at present might awaken poli-
ticians to the potentialities of this part of
the Commonwealth. —W. P. T. (N.S.W.).
Community Living
Lord Beveridge asserts that the average
housewife wants to go on being a drudge
and that she herself is the chief obstacle
to any improvements in the task of house-
work. Well, as a housewife, I’m all in
favor of vacuum-cleaners, electric-stoves
and coppers, and similar labor-saving
devices, but I’m certainly in the “obstacle”
class where Lord Beveridge’s suggested
community-living is concerned.
Community laundries, nurseries and res-
taurants may be all very fine in theory, but
in practice they would tend to break up
home life and take away the personal and
individual aspects of our homes.
Before marriage I was a career girl in
the fullest sense of the word, with no inter-
est in things domestic; now I find run-
ning my home far more intriguing and
“glamorous” than working for somebody
else ever was. I’m not house-proud, or
overfastidious, nor do I enjoy drudgery.
It is simply that running a home is so
satisfying.
Almost everything about housework is
creative, from making a room attractive
and pleasant to live in to cooking a nour-
ishing and tasty meal. I have no “boss,”
and everything I do is for the benefit of
my family and myself. There is no rush
for a morning tram or ’bhs, and I don’t
work routine hours. Although my day is
longer than it used to be, I know I can
have an hour off if I really want it. De-
spite shortages, rationing and so forth, I
don’t think the average woman would
give up her home for any other job.
With so many forces at work to take
away our individuality and personal
liberty, Australians—-both men and women
—should continue to be “obstacles” to
ideas that involve community living.—
Housekeeper (N.S.W.).
Spain and Australia
Professor Salvador de Madariaga’s The
Rise of the Spanish American Empire is
worth reading by thoughtful Australians.
He shows that processes at work in Aus-
tralia today were considerable factors in
the economic decay of Spain in the
sixteenth and seventeenth centuries. One
significant chapter, “Inflation Without
Production,” records in effect:
After the acquisition of the South and
Central American colonies, and the -dis-
covery therein of huge deposits of the
precious metals, Spain suffered a sharp
inflation of prices. Had the influx of gold
and silver been accompanied by a corre-
sponding increase of industrial activity this
would have been rectified, and Spain might
well have antedated Britain as Europe’s
foremost manufacturing country.
The reverse happened. Not only did
extensive emigration to the colonies reduce
the country’s manpower, but those who re-
mained tended to prefer an easy time to
hard work. The bullring was more popular
than the workshop. Land went out of
cultivation. Elements who favored price-
control unaccompanied by wage-pegging
also won the ear of the Government. As
an additional assistance to the checking of
price rises there was prohibition of the
export of many lines of goods, while im-
portation of foreign-made articles of the
same kinds was encouraged. This policy
had a ruinous effect on Spanish secondary
industry.
Hence the gaining of such a vast, rich
empire meant for Spain, not enhanced pros-
perity, but progressive impoverishment,
which eventually brought about political
decline.
Some features of that disastrous policy
are integral to the programme of the
Australian Labor party. The trade-union
movement, which virtually dictates policy
to that party, favors price-control not
allied with wage-pegging. There has
also been an increasing inclination to
idleness among Australian workers. They
listen too eagerly to Labor leaders who
advocate shorter hours, and too many
loaf on the job. Production in all essen-
tial industries has fallen substantially
within the last decade. Lavish spending
on drink, gambling and amusements has
become more pronounced. Through ex-
pansion of credit by the Federal Labor
Government —there are four times as
many bank notes in circulation as in
1939 —Australia is moving along the road
to inflation.
Unless production is increased to bring
it in line with the increase in currency,
Australia will eventually suffer in the
same way as did Spain.— Kanimbla
(N.S.W.).
How to Lose Trade
“Australia has lost chilled-poultry
markets in Palestine, which are worth
about £1,000,000 a year, through ship-
ments of poor-quality poultry and care-
less packing.”
That statement, by the secretary of the
National Poultryfarmers’ Association,
brings to mind several other cases of
markets lost to Australia through similar
carelessness. American canned fruit
brought four times as much as Australian
in Malaya because our tins had rusted and
had their labels half-off. Yet the quality
of our fruit was far superior.
Australia also lost valuable egg markets
in Malaya last year through shipments
of unusable eggs.
When Sir John Latham was our repre-
sentative in the East he was asked to
investigate a complaint that cargoes of
flour shipped by us were short-weight
He found that the gross weight*delivered
was correct, but that there was a varia-
tion of as much as three pounds over
or under the weight we had contracted to
supply in the bags. The result was that
China changed Australia, with her “near-
enough-is-good-enough” policy, from
first to last on her list of flour-importing
countries. —F. P. (Vic.).
Root of the Matter
Why did the British turn down the
Churchill Government in 1945? No
previous leader in a victorious war was
defeated in the constituencies. Collin
Brooks, in Devil’s Decade, offers an ex-
planation :
The exuberant gestures, too-lusciously
enjoyed cigars and changes of picturesque
garb, the too-responsive welcome to hazard
and danger, had become a weariness to
the suffering flesh of bombed and battered
citizens.
It is, at least, an interesting theory.—
Balaclava (Vic.).
In a declaration to the Taxation De-
partment a Newcastle enginedriver
claimed to have saved £lO,OOO in 36
years. The disclosure may stop the rush
of ambitious young enginedrivers to fol-
low Chifley and Drakeford into politics.
—Nob (N.S.W.).
Mr. Forde has been heard of again, this
time from Vancouver, where he burbled
that British, Canadian and American
“interests” had invested £A49,000,000 in
Australia since the war and that the
country was on the verge of a “golden
era” —“age” was Chifley’s word. The
only “golden era” in sight is that beheld
by “Labor” politicians, who have
been busy with salary grabs and pensions
rackets and are trying to multiply their
numbers. The “golden era” for taxpayers
is the one they left behind in 1939. —
T. O. (Q.).
I don’t know who is responsible for
the present flood of radio advertising
urging us to use more eggs, but why
waste the growers’ money on advertising
when the poor old housewife has almost
to go down on her knees to the grocer to
get a couple of the precious things each
week? When there were plenty of eggs
about there was no publicity, but now
that they are as scarce as bottled beer,
the radio is blaring out a thousand reasons
why we should use more of them. —
Simple Simon (N.S.W.).
In the main, Australian place- and
street-names are the dullest collection
imaginable. The latest masterpiece is the
naming by Marion district council (S.A.)
of a street after a horse which won a race
called the Chairman’s Handicap. Com-
pare our place-names with those in
England and the U.S. —names like Dela-
ware, Tennessee, Wyoming and the like.
We have States with two- and three-word
names which are not only dull but a con-
founded nuisance. Imagine an author or
songster or poet letting himself go on
romantic expressions to rhyme with New
South Wales or South Australia? Even
Shakspeare wasn’t* that good.— Camsa
(5.A.).-

One of the ambitions of every housewife is to reign
over a modern all-steel kitchen. It is so nice to come
home to something to be proud of and, most
importantly, to work in.
Nothing contributes more to gracious living than
today’s ideal kitchen. Here is a domain where steel’s
strength, versatility and pleasing appearance is at once
apparent. In the hands of industry steel has brought
to reality the plans of architects and engineers for
greater kitchen effectiveness and beauty.
Yes, today’s dream kitchens with their stainless steel
sinks, electric and gas cooking ranges, trouble-free
hot water services, steel-built freezers and refrigerators,
and space-saving steel storage cabinets are a far cry
from the days of the hand-turned cooking spit and the
iron pot on the hob.
The use of steel in kitchen furnishings and equipment
provides evidence of the fact that steel can do more
jobs better than any other material.
B.H.P. steel —product of the fusion in the furnaces
at the Newcastle Steel Works of South Australian iron
ore and limestone and New South Wales coal —plays its
part in enabling the Australian housewife to enjoy the
benefits of modern kitchen design^
