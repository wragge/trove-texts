If you’re wondering how we manage to cover that
many miles an hour, the answer is really
very simple. We do it by going so many places. All
at once. Just as we’re about to take off in San
Francisco, we’re landing in Hong Kong, circling over
Manila, approaching Zamboanga, serving
cocktails above Honolulu, fastening seat belts in
Australia and taxiing in to Taipei. You
can see how a thing like that adds up. So there’s
really nothing new about flying
6,000 m.p.h. We do it every day.

Wynns have taken the
unusual step of making
the 1964 vintage
Coonawarra Estate Hermitage
concurrently available with the
’63, released earlier this year.
This is a somewhat fuller wine
than the ’63, matured 2 years in
oak and 12 months in the bottle,
and makes satisfying drinking
now.
However, it makes an even
better investment. Particularly
at this year’s reasonable price
and in the light of possible
future shortages.
If you’ve got the space, and
the willpower, lay down some
1964 Hermitage now. This
simply means it continues to
mature in your cellar instead
of ours. Apart from the
economic advantages, the fringe
benefit is an undeniable smug
sense of possession and
security. And by buying ’64
now, you gain some 20 to
30 cents a bottle each year.
Coonawarra Estate
’63 Hermitage
The ripening period of 1963 at
Coonawarra was unusually
humid, which seems to have
added subtlety to the wine,
giving it greater delicacy yet
with a deeply satisfying full
flavour. It may well prove to be
the best Australian Hermitage
ever.
Coonawarra Estate
’62 Cabernet
Following the 1960 vintage,
the 1962 is a bigger wine in
which the oak-maturation and
Cabernet Sauvignon character
form a well balanced soft
symphony of flavour. The
Cabernet is bottled only in
outstanding vintage years, these
have been ’54, ’57, ’5B, ’59, ’6O
and ’62. The 1962 vintage is
now available but only in
limited quantity.

By day the
loafers, at night
the scoundrels
OUR GPO was described by the Vic-
torian Gazetteer of 1879 as “by far the
handsomest and most magnificent
structure in Australia.” Right now we
are celebrating its centenary. Actually
the PMG has been a little churlish
about it. At no time during the celebra-
tions has anyone mentioned that
actually the entire construction of the
building was purely a Victorian
Colonial affair, and it had nothing to
do with a non-existent Commonwealth.
And it’s interesting that the Victorian
PMG detided to open it on the long
weekend of June 29-July 1, 1867.
You see, July 1, was a full holiday in
honor of separation. July 1 was like
July 14, Bastille Day the day when
we rejoiced in our freedom from the
terrible yoke of New South Wales.
Thirty thousand went through the
building on the Saturday and a similar
number on the Monday.
You must have seen this vast build-
ing on the corner of Bourke and
Elizabeth Streets. The architecture
would best be described as Mid-
Victorian-Italian-Manchester-Super. It’s
downright interesting that it came
about as the result of a competition.
There was a first prize of £3OO for the
outer design, with lesser prizes for
second and third, and £3OO for the
inner design with lesser prizes. This
explains a great deal. The outside is
over-columned, over-fussed, clearly gee-
whiz style, but the inside is beautiful.
There are, perhaps, three really
beautiful rooms in Melbourne—the ball-
room at Government House, the Chan-
delier Room at Menzies, and the mar-
vellous red plush Legislative Council
chamber, with all the plump topless
Victorian ladies prancing about the
ceiling. The postal hall, though, at
the GPO is something to see. Accord-
lng to the 1867 figures, it is 85ft. by
40ft. with a ceiling 70ft. high. All
around on the first-floor level there are
arched cloisters where one could
almost picture, instead of scudding
messenger boys, nuns quietly reading
meir rosaries.
But the outside is a bit much. And
1 one were compiling for the tourist
uses a list of Melburnian atrocities
ln architecture that people must see,
then one would put down Flinders
Street railway station, the Shrine, and
the GPO. Unquestionably there is a
lesson for all humanity that these
buildings were the result of architec-
tural competitions.
Actually our GPO took nearly nine
years to build. It was begun in
January, 1859. As the “Argus” said,
men went grey, ministries came and
went in that time. Really it was an
unbelievable effort, because the only
other decent permanent buildings about
were Parliament House, the Treasury,
the Melbourne Club, and the Princess
Theatre. They had to put up a new
building, because the old wooden post
office, in the wisdom of our fore-
fathers, had been built over a stagnant
swamp, and all the PMG employees
were going down with disease.
But enough of that. Let’s give you
some of the euphoria which appeared
in the “Argus” on June 29, 1867: “This
building is no makeshift stuccoed,
tawdry and temporary. To climb the
beautifully cut and fluted bluestone
steps and walk down the vista of the
colonnade under a succession of vaulted
roofs, and upon an elegantly laid out
pavement of encaustic tiles, red, blue,
and yellow, will be to some the realisa-
tion of pictures out of the ‘lllustrated
London News.’ The thing is built for
ages, not for generations, and a cen-
tury’s wear and tear would scarcely
give such a building an air of maturity.
If the police did not interfere, the
cool shades of this piazza would be a
paradise for loafers by day and scoun-
drels by night until the year 2000 and
more.”
Oh, yes, according to the “Argus”
there was not only every conceivable
comfort in the building, there was also
protection for the morals of employees.
Up aloft there was a glass screen
through which detectives could watch
sorters below.
Some time before the opening of the
post office, flag signals displayed at
the top of the tower indicated the
“The first time it’s struck in 100 years!”

arrival of mails, different colors for

But for the 1867 opening, they had
constructed “a monster lamp filled with
12 gas jets” to be hoisted to the ton
of the flagpole at nightfall. It was
visible from all directions and colored
slides were used to correspond with the
flags during the daytime. We regret to
say that this Commonwealth show has
no such service now.
In 1888 we added another floor and
raised the clock tower to 188 ft. In
1890 the original clock was replaced
and we added another seven Glasgow-
cast bells to the carillon. This carillon
used to play tunes automatically night
and day. Indeed, it was estimated that
it gave 32,496 performances a year.
There were such numbers as “Rule
Britannia,” “Home Sweet Home,”
“Last Rose of Summer,” “Men of
Harlech,” “Jesus Lover of My Soul,”
“Coming Through the Rye,” and
“Jenny Jones.” This bracket was
judged to create patriotic fervor in
almost every breast. By 1907 there were
so many complaints from insomniacs
that the carillon was stopped for 27
years until it was revived in 1934. We
have similar tunes now, but we only
set patriotic hearts beating between 9
a.m. and 9 p.m.
The chime is noble and Big Bennish.
It is broadcast over Radio Australia
every day and we. always gather there
to see the New Year in. Undoubtedly,
our best effort was at the birth of the
new century on December 31, 1900.
There were 15,000 outside the post
office. The city was blazing with
light and, incredibly, all the leading
stores were open. There were whistles,
trumpets, euphoniums, bells. As the
big hand approached midnight there
was an eerie hush. First came the 16
bells that heralded the striking of the
hour, then there was a tremendous
burst of cheering. A man with a
cannon, on the veranda of a shop
opposite, put a match to the blowhole
and a boom rang out. Then, as the
chimes rang, the crowd, according to
the “Argus,” reverently bared their
heads and sang the National Anthem.
A beacon on top of the post office
bathed everything in a red glow, there
were Roman candles, fireworks, and
later the crowd sang “Soldiers of the
Queen.” What with the boys battling
with the Boers, we were most patriotic.
Now with all this history behind us,
last week we had a ceremony in that
grand postal hall. The Lord Mayor
declared a Postal Exhibition open. He
pressed a button, and those same chimes
which rang out on December 31, 1900,
rang out again. Neither he nor any
other official mentioned that in the
midst of all this marvellous progress,
we were also in the midst of a postal
strike, or that the Senate was defeat-
ing the Government over postal charges.
It makes you wonder why these things
come about.
Maybe the place is a paradise for
loafers by day and scoundrels by
night.

SOMETHING
NEW
WITH GRAHAM KERR
A cook's tour
of kitchens
round the world
IN EUROPE, during my recent tour
of the world’s great eating places, I
uncovered an international problem of
real severity for people who enjoy
good food and wine. To paraphrase
the song title, it has to do with “Where
have all the good staff gone?” And the
answer is to America, that’s where.
We are used to hearing about the
shortage of skilled kitchen staff and
poor dining-room service in Australia
and New Zealand. We’ve been told
for years that because careers in the
hotel and restaurant industries carry
overtones of servility and lowered
social standing, young people here
prefer to look elsewhere for jobs. But
what of the Old World, the last bastion
of fine service and fine food?
The situation is that the old Euro-
pean standards are under tremendous
strain. In Paris, in the famous Hotel
Meurice, I found the manager lament-
ing: “We are fortunate to have our
chef de cuisine. He is of the old
school. He understands that good food
requires time. But the young people
understand time only, and not the
pleasures of the table.” When you find
the French in trouble like this, you
know things are serious.
In London, at the Savoy, the maitre
chef de cuisine, Silvino Trompetto,
was a trifle more cheerful. “It is an
honor to work in the Savoy kitchens,”
he said. “Practically every one of my
kitchen staff is a potential hotel direc-
tor. But they are, in fact, purely
transient so thank God it is an
honor!”
It was in Italy that I first discovered
the immediate reason for the dis-
appearance of good service in Europe.
Antonio Prantera, chairman of a res-
taurant association which covers all
cafes, eating houses, and fine restaur-
ants in Italy, told me that in his
famous Rome restaurant, Hostaria
dell’Orso, he trained three excellent
wine waiters only to have each one quit
in less than six months. The reason:
they had been offered jobs in the
United States at nearly three times the
money he could pay.
It’s a new brain drain f ronl
Europe’s great kitchens. The Ameri-

cans can pay for their pleasures the
Europeans must suffer.
prices in Europe aren’t exactly cheap
either, though it’s hard to know whether
this is because of the high cost of
tradition or simply the result of a bit
of clever cooking of the books. There
is also a monotony about the food.
The dishes are classical, most having
been served continuously for 100 years
or more. But the selection offered has
narrowed down to the dishes that can
be served quickly. The reduced
variety is accompanied, in my opinion,
by reduced standards.
Originality was once part of the
attraction of the great restaurants.
Today you could almost collect a
menu from the immigration authorities
on entering a country and, save for
alteration of a few prices, use it for
any restaurant.
Europeans, to some extent, are also
trapped within their traditions. Those
who can afford to dine out want the
dishes they know by reputation and
don’t like venturing into new cuisine
country. They are unlikely to be
tempted by any specialty placed on
the menu by the chef. This is even
truer of the American tourists, who
seem to me practically to control the
eating habits in European restaurants.
The locals find it harder every year
to afford to eat out.
In America, the situation is quite
different. Since they have nabbed the
good staff from Europe, you’d expect
to find excellent service and you do.
In fact, it is superb. The Americans
expect perfection, as a matter of habit,
and are prepared to pay for it. For
my tastes, though, the sumptuousness of
the decor in some of their restaurants
makes the food, by comparison, seem
a poor offering.
But Italy, for one, is not prepared
to let its cuisine reputation be
eclipsed by the Americans without a
fight. Last year the Italians ran a big
competition to find new dishes which
would put Italian cooking back on
the international map. Emphasis was
put not merely on taste and presenta-
tion but equally on simplicity of
preparation in commercial quantities.
The idea was that this way the strain
would be taken off kitchen staff and
it would not be necessary to employ
skilled chefs. In a way it was a com-
promise between the elaborate cooking
of the past and the methods of today’s
high-class American restaurants.
In Australia, through our quest for
“Great Australian Dishes,” we are
trying to encourage the same sort of
cooking creativity. I admit I expected
to receive some haughty looks when
I suggested to some great restaurateurs
abroad that they put Australian dishes
on their famous menus, but I was
delighted to find that they all (Ameri-
cans included) agreed enthusiastically.
Having discovered that my task is
n °t as difficult as I had imagined, I
am now concerned that we should
come up with some really original
and characteristic Australian dishes to
show the world.

By DAPHNE GUINNESS
IT IS 8.30 in the evening and 200
people are here in the Darlinghurst
Galleries, Crown Street, pressed hip
to hip, drinking champagne. This is
the $3 social crowd, which has turned
out for the N.S.W. Art Gallery Soc-
iety’s show, The Woman Collector.
Earlier, at the first showing, about the
same number drank aperitifs, tickets
$1.50. They maintained they were the
smart ones.
Earlier still, around 10 a.m., the 30
women collectors converged on Crown
Street carrying paintings and objets
d’art of various shapes and sizes. Any-
one not knowing what was going on
might have thought a massive art bur-
glary was taking place. On an earlier
occasion when the gentlemen collectors
went on display, their works of art
were collected from their homes. But
Sir Warwick Fairfax’s butler invited
the people who came to do the picking-
up to “help themselves,” so perhaps now
security is tightening up.

There’s the Hon. Secretary, Mervyn
Horton, passing round little oblong
sandwiches, saying, of course, that Dick
Watkim disturbs you, all art should dis-
turb. And everyone re-examines Mrs.
Noela Yuill’s painted wood relief. Fer-
vently. And there’s Daniel Thomas, a
curator of the Gallery, placating one
pained collector who’s complaining her
work of art is not shown to its best
advantage, and sweeping another off
to prove hers is brilliantly hung on the
best wall.
Over on the far side, people are
paying court to Lady Lloyd Jones’
Utrillo. It’s examined both front and
back by everyone, including Mrs.
Hanne Fairfax, whose contribution to
the show is a Godfrey Miller. “You
know,” jokes a girl, “no one’d have the
nerve to tell Lady Lloyd Jones if it were
a fake.” Well, it’s not a fake, replies a
shocked, sharp voice. It’s very real.
This exhibition is in honor of the
Australian woman collector. What sur-
prises Daniel Thomas is that she is a
different sort of collector from the Aus-
tralian man. More adventurous. He had
his job cut out deciding what to hang
from whom. In the end he selected 30
women who collected without the aid
of husband or anyone, the unprofes-
sional, the girl who did it for pleasure.
And what he’s got here tonight is in-
teresting, mark you, but peanuts com-
pared with the Gentleman’s exhibition
they ran the year before last. That was
worth a fortune. This is insured for
$lOO,OOO. Never mind. It’s interesting.
He expected naive paintings like Miss
Ann Cotter’s Henri Bastin, and luxuri-
ous abstracts like Mrs. Philip Jeffrey’s

Mrs. John Lewis have alarmed their
husbands by an increasing addiction to
giant abstractions. It might be relevant
he suggests, that advanced art is usually
less expensive.
Mr. Thomas is indulging in some
pretty advanced art himself tonight.
He’s wearing a Chicago gangster tie
huge wide red-and-blue silk affair*
which he pulls out and arranges care-
fully outside his jacket. It belongs to
Robert Hughes, who left it in a room
in London. Mr. Thomas wore it the
other day for a lecture, and quite by
accident the spotlight stayed on it all
the time. No one heard a word he
uttered, all they looked at was his
tie. “Oh, you spoke beautifully,
Daniel,” says Mrs. Paris, “of course
they heard.”
There aren’t many Women Collec-
tors here, most came for the first
showing well, doll, that was the
smart one but, after all, it’s not
them people have come to gaze at . . .
A mesmerised art lover peers down
at Miss Alice Mills’ feet encased in
gold-strapped black wooden sandals,
the latest thing from London. “. . .
they rest my poor tired feet and
everyone’s wearing them. John Boii-
ney’s got a pair, Dean Dixon’s got two
though, of course, not for conduct-
ing in . . .” There, adds Miss Mills,
clumping up and down, aren’t they
marvellous? Who is Miss Mills? A
Gallery Society member, and she sort
of does publicity for this wooden foot-
gear in Australia . . .
Over on the other side a glass
breaks behind Peter Young, the ABC
man who says quippy things between
records on Sunday afternoons. He’s
here under false pretences. Robert
Shaw, the Hon. Treasurer, asked him,
and where is he, he’d like to know?
What Peter Young thought he was
going to see was a collection of nude
women paintings owned by men.
Another glass breaks. There, bad luck
wherever he goes.
It is nearly ten. Mrs. Paris tells
Mervyn Horton she’s getting a paper
and board exhibition of clothes and
furniture and things. What, asks Mr.
Horton, do we do with it? He knows
what Daniel Thomas will do, try to
light a dress to see if it’s inflammable.
On the stroke of ten someone starts
flashing lights off. Mr. Horton comes
out with a broom and starts sweeping.
Somewhere in the gloom a couple be-
gin to dance.
All that Daniel Thomas wants to add
is that Tom Gillies designed the orange
ribbon number tags on the pictures
(wasn’t that brilliant?) and the next
excitement will be the biggest exhibi-
tion since Captain Cook set foot in
Australia, followed by something folk-
loreish connected with Ed Clark, the
American Ambassador. He is f°lk-
loreish, isn’t he?
Oh, and Sir Kenneth Clark, the
English authority on art, says t e
Gallery’s got stored away some of t e
best pornography he’s ever seen.

It's "Sidewinder", the revolutionary new
ducting for Vulcan heaters. And cleverly
processed Alcoa aluminium makes the
heating system just about the quietest
thing in your home.
As warm air is circulated at speeds
higher than normal through the insulated
aluminium ducting, noise (a major problem
until now) is absorbed through thousands
°f tiny perforations in the aluminium.
The faster flow of heated air and
the elimination of noise add considerably
to your comfort.
There are several good reasons why
Vulcan chose Alcoa aluminium. The
m etal’s ductility, for one. The aluminium
ducting is so flexible it curves around
obstructions under floor level without
having.to be specially bent or hand-fitted.
This speeds installation and cuts costs.
Aluminium is heat reflective, too, so
there’s a minimum of heat loss on the
way to your furthest room.
And since aluminium resists corrosion,
the ducting system can be fitted and
forgotten. It's maintenance free.
Vulcan has a good idea; versatile Alcoa
aluminium makes it practical.

The Wayside Chapel
The Wayside Chapel is a rebuilt block of flats in a side street of Sydney's noted
Kings Cross. It was opened in 1964
THE WAYSIDE CHAPEL at Kings
Cross gets a lot more inches in news-
papers than St. Andrew’s or St. Mary’s
Cathedral.
One day it is opening a free employ-
ment bureau for young men with long
hair or beards whose hairiness makes it
difficult for them to get jobs. Then it
is opening its own drug referral centre.
This, the first in Australia it is claimed,
is a clinic at which addicts can receive
advice, then be referred to hospital for
treatment.
No sooner do happenings begin to
happen than the Wayside Chapel pre-
sents Jim Sharman’s “An Inevitable
Happening.” We have just learnt to
spell “psychedelic” when the chapel’s
discotheque becomes a psychedelic dis-
cotheque. A “topless” dancer is
smuggled in to appear in a university
revue there, but the minister, the Rev.
Mr. Ted Noffs, rules that she is not
“sensuous.”
John Llewellyn reads Dylan Thomas
there; for an extended season there are
late-night performances of Genet’s “The
Maids” and lunch-hour presentations
of Albee’s “The Death of Bessie Smith.”
There is a presentation of Samuel
Beckett’s “Happy Days,” with actress
Leila Blake up to her neck in sand.
Jane Powell gets married there with
2000 people waiting outside. (“Isn’t it
just like Hollywood?”) Andrea drops
in for a few moments’ meditation after
a hard day’s talking at the radio station;
then she has written the first verse of
a hymn for the Chapel.
There is always something doing, but
it isn’t often that the sermons of Mr.
Noffs get into the church columns of
the Monday morning newspapers.
In much the same way that other
churches have been so busy with ritual
or organisation that they have forgotten
their mission, so the Wayside Chapel
sometimes seems so busy being a coffee
shop, a theatre, a disco that you forget
it is a Methodist Church with three
services on Sundays.
However, for most of the people who
go there it is the only sort of religion
they are ever likely to know, and,
perhaps, it is more than enough.


The Chapel attracts all age
groups and all hairstyles. The
Upper Room is open from 8
o’clock to midnight every night
Left: Discussion group in the
theatre, which is attached to the
Chapel, with the Rev. Mr. Ted
Noffs at the rostrum
Right: Service in the Wayside
Chapel, which is run by the
Methodist Church, is helped with

Pictures by Roderic Hulsbergen


“Happenings” happen every Sunday afternoon at the
Wayside Chapel, with various popular music groups taking
part. A committee of 60 lay people help at the Chapel
Below: Swami Venkatasananda, who has been lecturing
in Australia, visited the Chapel. Mr. Noffs has said that
Buddhism seems more fashionable than Christianity
Right: The Upper Room at the Chapel is also used as an
art gallery, with contributions from many of the young
artists who visit the chapel, either for church or coffee


ONE MORE
WEEK
Many happy returns
SEEING that Melbourne is our
financial capital one expects these things
to happen. Batman reports that he
received cards from six different firms
this year wishing him a “Happy and
Prosperous Financial New Year.” They
are now sitting over his mantelpiece.
Capers Restaurant in Collins Street
even had a Financial New Year’s Eve
party. The menu was printed on a
Form S Income Tax Return. There
were streamers, balloons, funny hats,
roll-up blowers, and free champagne.
The stroke of midnight was a deeply
moving occasion. The guests held
hands, sang “Auld Lang Syne,” and
respectfully remembered that at this
point of time every grand Melburnian
company died financially and was again
horn anew.
Holy smoke
CIGARETTE BRANDS proliferate,
and as each enters the marketing fray
it stakes a claim to a different social
sub-group. With tattooed outdoor types,
elegant jet-setters, and clean-cut sports-
lovers already spoken for, the latest
brands are aimed at very esoteric con-
sumer profiles indeed.
Grenadier ignored the tide of anti-
British opinion by appealing to smokers
of Imperial sentiment, while this week
saw r the launch of a cigarette called
Churchman. While the announcer
murmurs about the product in reverent
tones, the soundtrack features “Trumpet
Voluntary”; this happens to be the
theme of Victorian radio’s long-running
Catholic Hour.
Out of Bond
THE WHIMSY of some real-estate
advertisements occasionally spills over
into the Used Car columns. A few
days ago a Sydney firm was selling an
Aston Martin DB4, a sister car to the
James Bond model, minus a few extras
which J.B. needed. The “Sydney Morn-
ing Herald” advertisement read: “Only
reason for sale is that our elderly
managing director collected so much
crumpet, and attendant benefits, with
the car that his doctor has ordered
complete rest for six months, the dis-
posal of the Aston, and a return to
his 1926 Austin tourer.”
However, this was hardly the whole
tr uth. The owner has now bought an
ho Rivolta for $14,800; this is an
halian-made car with Chevrolet com-
ponents. The Aston was a 1960 model,
has done 50,000 miles and cost $14,000.
There had been more than 100 inquiries
for it. We don’t know how many phone
calls the “SMH” classified section had
from people anxious to fill in a gap in
its knowledge of slang.
Ex machine
OUR ENTHUSIASM for Postcode
is tempered by the fact that while the
code numbers are useful for mail pass-
ing through the electronic sorters in
Sydney’s mail exchange they will serve
no purpose in other centres until
similar equipment is installed; in
Queensland, for example, that will be
at least three years. The Post Office
says the time lag will allow the public
to become familiar with the system, but
this seems a long familiarisation period,
or a poor excuse for very slow action
by a Government pledged to take
additional millions from the public in
postal charges come Budget time.
Shedding light
STRATA TOWN HOUSES at present
being built in Sydney will be enriched
by the addition of infra-red lights over
the bathtubs. No sooner had rival pro-
ject builders Pettit and Sevitt heard
this when they countered with ultra-
violet lamps over theirs, in both bath-
rooms.
This competitive spirit is exciting,
but which bathroom would you choose?
Infra-red Strata or ultra-violet Lowline?
The Australian Medical Association
says that ultra-violet gives the best tan,
infra-red gives the most warmth. But,
whether you want warmth or a good
tan, you look like missing out if you
take a shower.
Coburn in wool
THE FIRST THREE tapestries de-
signed by an Australian artist and
woven at the noted Aubusson centre in
France will be on display for one
night only at Kym Bonython’s Hungry
Horse Gallery, Sydney, on July 13.
The Clune Galleries have recently
held their second exhibition of tapestries
by John Olsen, which are woven in
Portugal; the Hungry Horse hopes to
develop its “stable” of painters design-
ing for tapestry, and hopes that the
friendly rivalry between galleries and
artists will induce more architects,
business houses, and private collectors
to appreciate the possibilities of
tapestry.
Mr. Coburn’s work was chosen by
Aubusson’s representative in Australia,
Mr. Lucien Dray. The edition of each
tapestry will be limited to three; prices
are around $3OOO.
Mr. Dray hopes, in association with
the Hungry Horse, to run an invitation
competition among Australian artists;
three artists will have two paintings
selected to be sent to the Aubusson
works for weaving.
In any case, artists selected to design
tapestries can be sure of their work
being available on the international
market. Mr. Dray also hopes to secure
the interest of the Australian Wool
Board. Aubusson tapestries use Austra-
lian wool exclusively, and since the
tremendous revival of tapestries, set in
motion by Lurcat, consumption of
wool for this purpose has risen sharply.
Chain letter
A LETTER received this week begins:
“The middle-income group, in the
main, is composed of persons who ex-
hibit those facets of individuality and
ability which, taken overall, are the
necessary factors for the development
and progress of our country.”
The letter then goes on to claim
that the middle-income earner in Aus-
tralia is harder hit by income tax than
in almost any other country.
The final paragraph suggests that if
you make ten copies of this letter and
post one to ten responsible persons of
your choice, you “may be the means
by which the present taxation system
could become more equitable,” which
suggests that the sender is a person
who exhibits those facets of individual-
ity and ability which are necessary for
the development and progress of our
country.

MICHAEL BAUME WRITES OH THE
ECONOMY
There's even more
to come
from BHP
IT IS OUR FIRST billion-dollar com-
pany; last week it reported our biggest-
ever public profit; it has, jointly,
found Australia’s biggest oil and gas
fields; it has discovered “significant”
deposits of nickel, the latest “in” metal;
It is the major partner in Australia’s
biggest iron ore export development
at Mt. Newman in Western Australia;
it produced in 1966-67 a record amount
of steel (and promises to produce even
more next year); it is a major exporter;
It is spending more on even further
expansion than any other company in
Australia.
'lt is BHP, the company that repre-
sents in one group* all the exciting things
that are happening to the Australian
business scene.
But only 15 months ago, the share
market did not like BHP one little
bit. Its $2 shares were selling for only
$4.66 and its profit was falling as last
year’s mini-recession knocked the rate
of local steel usage quite sharply just
at a time when BHP had brought in
extra capacity to meet what it had
expected to be increased demand
with the result that it had to sell off
a great deal of its steel at the cheap
rates current in export markets.
Now, the stockmarket is taking a
very different view of BHP; last week
its shares hit $lO each, more than
double their price of 15 months ago,
making the company worth $1.3 bil-
lion dollars (more than double that of
its nearest rival). What has hap-
pened to make the market change its
mind? Just about everything. And
there is plenty of evidence to suggest
that BHP shares could rise quite a lot
more before the end of the 19605.
The main reason for the big rise of
$5.30-odd a share (or $690 million in
market terms) over the last 15 months
has been oil and gas. The discoveries off
the Victorian coast have fired the imag-
ination of investors (particularly in
Melbourne, where the giant group
eccentrically insists on having its head
office despite the fact that the only
things it makes in Victoria are
decisions). And so these discoveries
should. The facts of the oil and gas
findings are not yet fully known. But
what has already appeared suggests that
BHP could have oilfields holding at
least 500 million barrels to share with
its partner Esso, as well as huge deposits
of natural gas which are to be turned
into cash by 1969, when Melbourne is
to be supplied in a deal that is a very
good one indeed for BHP.
If the BHP-Esso partnership ended
up making as much as $2 a barrel from
this oil after meeting operating costs,
this would mean that Bass Strait oil
was worth $5OO million to BHP alone,
or about $4 a share. Add the value of
the gas to this and these two things
alone could justify BHP’s price rise to
$lO.
If oil and gas can alone explain the
price rise for BHP, there are still
plenty of other things that could justify
even greater increases in this company’s
profits and share prices. One of them
is its stake in the massive Mt. Newman
iron ore development, the details of
which were announced only a few
months ago, but which the share market
has not so far seemed to comprehend.
BHP owns 30 percent of this (CSR
heads a consortium that has another 30
percent, and U.S., British, and Japanese
interests have the remaining 40 per-
cent). BHP is also the manager of
the project, which will export 100 mil-
lion tons of iron ore to Japan, at prices
around $8 a ton, and will take 70
million tons itself at a net cost of only
$1 a ton in capital outlay. So the impact
of Mt. Newman on BHP from 1970,
when it is scheduled to receive its first
Newman iron, should be very signifi-
cant, indeed; possibly $2 a share worth
of significance.
Then there are the nickel prospects
that BHP has discovered in Queens-
land (where it has gone into partner-
ship with International Nickel on a
detailed testing program) and near
Kalgoorlie, in Western Australia (where
it began test drilling last month). None
of the nickel fever that has done so
much for stocks that cluster around
Western Mining (which the market
now thinks is worth $220 million)
seems to have rubbed off on BHP.
Confirmation that BHP had a good
commercial deposit or two could add
a dollar a share to the stock.
But what about BHP’s main line of
business, which is still steelmaking.
Last week’s profit demonstrated
dramatically just how important the
company’s basic job will continue to
be, despite all the new developments
that have made BHP one of the most
attractive oil and mining stocks on the
lists. Not that the 17.1 percent rise in
net profit should be taken as an indica-
tion of the sort of things to come in
steel by any means; $2.3 million of the
$6.2 million profit rise was simply to
recover the profit fall of the previous
year. Forgetting about that, it me an s
that over the past two years, BHP’s
profits have risen by 10 percent, which
is remarkable at a time when the AuS-
tralian economy was in a most hesitant
stage of development and when major
steel users, like the motor trade and the
appliance industry, had been goi™
through such difficult times.
The implications for BHP’s steel
profits in the current financial year are
therefore that there should be a further
significant rise. For the latest big in-
crease was despite the fact that the net
profit per ton of steel produced was
only around the $7.05 mark. It is true
that this is well above the dismal level
of $6.56 of the previous year, when so
much of the company’s output had to
be sold overseas at depressed prices.
But it is well below the average of
$7.27 that was obtained over the past
seven years and which is more likely
to be restored in the current year.
Add to that the impact of further
increases in production as existing blast
furnaces contribute more to the year’s
total (No. 1 at Port Kembla was out
being relined for some weeks until the
end of April) and as the new Kwinana
plant comes on stream, and it seems
likely that steel production could rise
by a further million tons this year
to reach about million tons. So
BHP’s steel profits could well rise to
better than $47 million compared with
the latest year’s $42.2 million,' if, as
seems likely, it gets its average earn-
ings per ton back up to its old levels.
This would lift the earning rate to 18
percent from the present 16.3 percent
and would provide an opportunity for
BHP to increase its dividend from the
present uncomfortable 9.33 percent to
a more rounded figure.
More important, it dramatises the
significant growth element in the com-
pany’s basic steelmaking activities; the
latest profit is about 60 percent higher
than the boom-year profit of 1959-60.
There are few companies in Australia
that can point to that sort of growth.
Almost as important, in view of the
amount of cash that BHP is going to
have to put up for all these develop-
ments, is the amount of cash that the
company is retaining for its own use
from these high profits; its “cash flow
for the latest year was $93 million and
seems certain to be over the $lOO mil-
lion mark in the current year.
With Esso having offered to lend
BHP the money necessary for keep-
ing up its contribution to the Bass
Strait oil search, and with last years
debenture issue raising $4O million,
there may be little need for the com-
pany to raise much more cash to
finance its massive expansion. Never-
theless, it would be a nice gesture to
shareholders if BHP did make some
sort of share issue, probably at a modest
premium. The company is now rich
enough to make just this sort of gesture.

One of Way man Earthmovers' 10-yd. Model D Elevating Scrapers
on road construction project in South Australia’s "Tiger Country"
MDIIE
WITH 1 MIGHT Of
TOURNEAU-WESTINGHOUSE
Wayman Earthmovers Pty. Ltd’s two WABCO model
D’Pulls and 10E2 Elevating Scrapers fitted with wide
base tyres are self-loading sand on road construction
jobs in the Keith, Pinaroo and Lameroo Areas of South
Australia. These important projects will open up new
access roads to newly developed areas of farm land.
The roads have to be cut through sand hills up to 60
feet in height, presenting high rolling resistance and
poor flotation. In spite of these difficult conditions the
two WABCO Elevating Scrapers are performing excellently
obtaining heaped loads of this difficult to handle
material, with fast hauls all the way. As a result Wayman
has cut construction costs by 13% per mile!
Like all Australian made WABCO construction equipment,
the three sizes of WABCO/LW Elevating Scraper are
designed to produce profitable performance.

The round-table discussions: an
important or empty gesture?
THE GOVERNMENT MACHINE in
Canberra is being cranked slowly up
to its annual task of producing a
Budget. Within the departmental com-
plex the job is proceeding rather more
unevenly than usual, with the PM’s
Department giving others only three
days’ notice to prepare their submis-
sions. They were to be in by last Friday
but there are a good many stragglers.
Politicians are more used to operating
from the seat of their pants. They are
going through the usual motions, and
last week one was their round-table dis-
cussion with representatives of indus-
try. These six-monthly talks are often
the subject of ribald cynicism in
Canberra.
Originating in the Government’s near-
defeat in the 1961 credit squeeza elec-
tions they are regarded by many as a
mere gesture of Government interest in
the views of industry. They are held
between members of the Cabinet Econ-
omic Sub-committee (Holt, McMahon,
McEwen, Bury), and the titular heads
of farming, manufacturing, and com-
mercial interest groups. There were
present in the Cabinet room neither
Government public servants nor “pub-
lic servants” of the private interest
groups.
The submissions put are very varied.
In style there is the tongue-in-cheek
humor of the Primary Producers’ Union
in saying, before its comprehensive list
of requests for Government assistance,
that “the forthcoming Budget will not
Treasurer McMahon ... “ burdensome”
be an easy one for the Treasurer and we
do not propose to make his task un-
necessarily burdensome”; and also the
obsequiousness of the Chamber of
Manufactures with its deep apprecia-
tions of the opportunity to join in
shaping national economic policy.
However, Manufactures came up
with the most sophisticated analysis
of the economic situation. It argued that
considerable slack remains in the
economy despite the upturn of the
financial year just ended. “It is im-
portant to ensure that the upturn is not
checked but rather strengthened” it
said. “We believe that there is nothing
to suggest that boom conditions are
imminent” —and in evidence pointed to
the failure of unemployment to fall
from its present moderately high level.
And, because of excess capacity in in-
dustry, any recovery in factory expan-
sion spending is bound to be delayed
until well into 1968.
The other groups were pretty happy
about the balance of the economy. The
Chambers of Commerce, in a hedged-
around statement, put its view this way:
“The economy by and large is moving
toward a more satisfactory level of
operations.” The Woolgrowers and
Graziers’ Council said bluntly there was
no case for any further stimulus to con-
sumer spending. The motor vehicle
people were, however, unhappy with
their level of sales, castigating the Press
for an over-optimistic assessment of re-
cent statistics.
None of these views are very
startling and they do not differ greatly
from the spectrum of views represented
within the Treasury Department and
the Cabinet.
Industry leaders, however, tend to
discount the cynical comments some-
times made about the talks. One said:
“If members of the Cabinet weren’t
interested, they’re very good actors.”
Cabinet Ministers, he said, were keen to
use the occasion as an opportunity to
judge business feeling, and to compare
this with the Departmental papers.
The interest groups for their part say
it is valuable for them to be forced
to form a view, since the various State
organisations make some sort of an
effort to sound out their member and
hammer out a consensus.
As usual, the special pleas were made
—bigger fertiliser subsidies for farmers,
export incentives for manufacturers,
and so on. Some organisations put their
T. B. C. Walker, Woolgrowers’ ...
keep costs down”
claims in a broader context T. B. C.
Walker, of the Woolgrowers’ Council,
developed the theme that every effort
must be made to keep costs down, and
said the main obstacle at present was
a “combination of restrictive trading
practices and protective tariffs.” It also
argued for an incomes policy, especially
the gearing of wages to productivity,
the very policy the Government unsuc-
cessfully argued before the Arbitration
Commission.
The Chamber of Commerce sounded
off more loudly than ever about the
“disparity in growth rates between the
public and private sectors.” Higher
defence spending was accepted as neces-
sary, but the rapid expansion of public
spending elsewhere restricted the scope
for general economic expansion.
Tariff policy, although hardly rele-
vant to the preparation of the Budget,
was inevitably a subject for discordant
pronouncements. The Primary Pro-
ducers’ Union wanted a reduction of
tariff duties on Japanese goods, both to
make that country more inclined to
accept greater quantities of our exports,
and also to provide Australian industry
with the opportunity to buy cheap
equipment.
With other groups echoing this theme
the manufacturers were stung into
issuing a special “supplementary state-
ment” telling the Government it
“should not be influenced into abandon-
ing its long-established policy.” They
assured the Government “much of the
criticism was ill-informed” and in fact
we were not a high-tariff country after
all.
Coining the most notable phrase of
the consultations, the president of the


Chamber of Manufactures said that a
great contribution to rising costs came
from “an extreme burden of idleness.”
He was talking about the number of holi-
days, sick leave, and long-service leave
-—“all of which is granted on full pay.
“The idleness factor is a hard load
for industry to carry when struggling
to compete with highly industrialised
countries operating on lower cost
structures.”
External Affairs
"No Jamboree"
External Affairs Minister Hasluck ...
no proposals
THIS WEEK SAW the story of our
involvement in Asia unfold just a little
more, and it showed once again what
a passive role the Government is play-
ing.
At the ASPAC meeting in Bangkok,
the cautious Mr. Hasluck took with
him no proposals for expanding the
effectiveness of the organisation. It
transpires that we are going to provide
a clearing house for technical experts
in the region, but this was a Philippines
suggestion.
The Department of External Affairs
was not enthusiastic about the Taiwan-
ese proposal for a Food and Fertiliser
Bank either, or the Korean Cultural
Centre.
The Australian delegation is under-
stood to have sided with the more
neutralist inclined nations such as
Japan and Malaysia against the hard-
liners (Korea, Taiwan, and Vietnam)
in opposing the proposal to make the
organisation a more effective anti-
Communist alliance.
In the language of the Department
of External Affairs officials: “We don’t
want an anti-Communist jamboree.”
Australia wanted to keep ASPAC
scrupulously non-military to attract
nations such as Indonesia, Cambodia,
and Burma.
And our diplomatic efforts to cloud
the fact of the British military with-
drawal from Singapore took a heavy
knock when the Singapore Prime Min-
ister said that such an “eventual with-
drawal is a fact of life.”
In the past, people in Government
in Canberra have often told journalists
they should not write about a British
withdrawal from Singapore because of
the effect it might have on the Sing-
apore economy in undermining the
faith of foreign investors. With Mr.
Lee having spoken so frankly, these
warnings look rather ridiculous.
The ACTU
Under attack
“THE GRAVEYARD OF industrial
disputes” was a description of the Aus-
tralian Council of Trade Unions given
by the Federal Secretary of the Amal-
gamated Postal Workers’ Union, Mr.
George Slater.
Mr. Slater, who recently returned
from a trip to Communist China and
is known to be fond of the works of
Chairman Mao, was putting in dramatic
language what the leadership of the
ACTU has known for some time: if the
Communists and the Left Wing can-
not control the ACTU they are going to
attempt to destroy its power.
The postal strike, which was based
on a genuine industrial grievance, may
be seen as one move in the game of
increasing union militancy and chal-
lenge to the ACTU. Another move
last week was the announcement of
the amalgation in the near future of
three of the biggest building unions;
an act which has been called by its
opponents a takeover by the Left Wing
Building Workers’ Industrial Union.
The most important sources of dis-
content for union leaders at the
moment are the “total wage” decision
of the Arbitration Commission and the
Metal Trades margins inquiry being
ACTU President Albert Monk ...
lost cause?
conducted by Commissioner Winter
The ACTU leaders are justifiably con-
cerned with the announcement that the
Commissioner cannot personally recom-
mend wage rates as a result of his in-
quiry and that his findings will have to
be put to the Full Bench of the Com-
mission.
The Communist-influenced Metal
Trades Unions have used the margins
delay to recommend to the ACTU a
national four-hour stoppage. If the
ACTU president, Mr. Monk, and secre-
tary Mr. Souter persuade their execu-
tive this week against supporting such
a stoppage it is likely that, as in the
case of the Postal Workers, strong
efforts will be made to by-pass their
authority. The Left will then attempt
to discredit the ACTU for both its lack
of militancy and its failure to control
its membership.
Disinclination to support stoppages
will be the basis of a strong Left Wing
attack on the present ACTU leadership
at the September biennial conference.
The hint will probably be passed, that,
if the ACTU does not support the
policies of the Left-wing unions, a
rival and more militant organisation
could be set up representing the Metal
Trades, Transport and Maritime, Fuel
and Power, and Building unions. At
present the Communist Party and its
followers are not united on the ques-
tion of how and under what circum-
stances such an alternative should be
established but recent negotiations in
both Melbourne and Sydney suggest
that the Moscow, Peking, and ideologic-
ally neutral factions of the Party are
re-establishing industrial harmony.
Mr. Monk and his executive will
have the support of the powerful Aus-
tralian Workers’ Union, which will be
attending its first ACTU conference, its
170,000 members represented by about
70 delegates. This delegation will ensure
that Mr. Monk wins the voting, but it
may influence the Communists and
militant Left to abandon the ACTU as
a lost cause.
Whilst all the industrial strategies
are being drafted, there is not much
evidence that the union movement is
looking as closely as it should at the
opportunities presented by the total
wage decision. Whilst the decision has
obvious disadvantages, (e.g. it prevents
leap-frogging from wage decision to
margins decision to wage decision etc.),
it also offers the opening for work
value cases in which the unions may
have more to gain than under the basic
wage and margins set-up.
The few work-value type cases which
have been fought in recent years have
won most substantial rises, the latest
in the journalists’ case.
The difficulty with work-value cases
is that they cannot be fought collec-
tively and they demand the kind of
research and presentation for which few
union officials have the time or train-
ing. Yet it is in this area rather than
those of strikes against the total wage
or in collective bargaining that unionists
will gain most.


The States
New taxes?
Premier Brand...over estimates
TASMANIA HAS LED the field in the
now-annual scramble for new State
taxes to fill spaces left in the coffers
after the yearly Commonwealth out-
pouring. Less than a week after return-
ing from Canberra, Premier Reece
offered his Parliament a new Bill to
amend the Stamp Duties Act and re-
turn $500,000 of the $700,000 current
shortage, through taxes on car registra-
tions, moneys on fixed deposit, “main-
land” cheques, mining-company share
transfers, hiring or rental agreements
for TV sets, vehicles, etc., running
more than two years, and regular pay-
ments by transfer from banks.
Over on the mainland, Sir Henry
Bolte, left to find much more ($l2-14
million) to prop up his Budget, was
considering less costly ways to collect
it. A nifty idea from Western Australia
had seized his fancy, the turnover tax.
Since last February W.A. has collected
l-3c on every $lO received by anyone
from a wage earner (employers pay)
to the biggest companies, with the
beautiful possibility of a growth rate
up to ten percent each year. Sir Henry
has let the idea be publicised and is
“looking at this as well as other pro-
posals,” with an ear open to public
reaction.
By now most of the States have seen
the $1 total wage rise flow to their p.ub-
Bc servants, adding millions to State
expenditure; in Queensland for in-
stance about S3J million. Some
Premiers have renounced any State tax
grab for the present. Mr. Askin of
N.S.W. is one, asking his Ministers to
cut down on works, but still determined
to continue Sydney’s Eastern Suburbs
Railway. South Australia’s Mr. Dunstan
rs another; and in the West, Mr. Brand,
already 50 percent over his estimates
of $600,000 for five months to June 30,
should be well satisfied with his turn-
ov e r tax. Queensland well,
Treasurer Chalk has said there will
be no reductions in State taxation,
even after finishing the year with $J
million, ten times the surplus he had
Budgeted for.
Brisbane
$40m. Bligh Plan
REJUVENATION of the aged and ail-
ing hearts of Australian cities is going
on slowly, with many stops and starts.
Finance is the drug most needed, and
because it seems to have to be “outside”
or overseas finance, it is hard to come
by. Sydney people, waiting for redevel-
opment of their Rocks and Hotel Syd-
ney areas, know this very well. Bris-
bane, looking very 19 th century overall,
has two imaginative plans to shoot
much of the city ahead the Wilbur
Smith traffic plan, and the $4O million
Bligh Plan for a massive new develop-
ment from the City Hall around to the
Roma St. railway station.
Brisbane architect Arthur Bligh began
his planning in 1964 when the city’s
municipal markets were moved from
the Roma St. area, leaving 2J acres
vacant. From there he conceived a
15-block redevelopment including the
markets site, with a hard core of three
blocks on which resumptions would cost
about $5l million. He would see a
State Arts Centre where the markets
were, and further redevelopment toward
City Hall, with an international-class
tourist hotel hard by that building, and
a private hotel (a circular tower build-
ing) nearby.
Bligh’s plan was received enthusi-
astically by the City Council (which
acts and speaks for all of Brisbane, not
merely the central city), and State
Cabinet. Some of the finance was
promised. Bligh’s firm prepared one
of the most elaborate and thorough
presentations, a 180-page illustrated
“feasibility report” which took in
Brisbane’s, Queensland’s and Australia’s
backgrounds so that overseas investors
might know exactly what they were
being offered.
This has been sent around the world,
and most recently Bligh has followed
it in person. He is due back this month.
And Brisbane is waiting to see how he
fared against the world’s financiers.
The Bligh Plan would mean more to
Brisbane than any of theirs to other
Australian cities because it would be
the motive force from which general
modernisation would flow. The city is
already committed to certain resump-
tions; in fact, some are under way. But
demolished buildings must be replaced
with new ones before hopes become
facts, and even those are going to be a
long time coming.
The multi-level Arts Centre is
planned to be built over a 10-15 years
period, financed from public funds
and Government subsidies. It will have
200,000 square feet of space, including
80,000 for the new Art Gallery.
Other elements of the Bligh Plan
would give the Queensland Railways a
place for centralised administration, a
better feeder services terminal, and
better adjacent passenger facilities. The
Bligh Plan would complement the Wil-
bur Smith Plan in its aim to give
Brisbane about 4J acres of traffic-free
walking and shopping space, some-
thing the hearts of most cities badly
need.
Around the complex would be three
multi-storey office blocks, high-rise
flats, and a department store with a
youth centre on the roof, many elevated
concourses, and some landscaped park
areas. A “living heart” instead of a
dying one.
A “living heart” for Brisbane... he $40m. Bligh Plan has an improved City
Square and an international hotel adjacent to the City Hall (left)


By-election
Holding Corio
THERE IS A CERTAIN amount of
unease in the ALP about the by-
election in the Federal seat of Corio.
Mr. Whitlam and the Victorian ALP
State executive would both like to
command the applause if the Labor
vote improves, or if by some chance,
their candidate, Mr. Scholes, wins.
On the other hand, each would like
to blame the other if Labor loses and
loses badly. The question is whether
to campaign the more strongly for the
applause, or campaign quietly and pre-
pare for the inquest. Keen students of
form would urge the latter.
Of the three most recent Federal
elections Labor polled best in 1963.
In the 1961 election when the Govern-
ment’s House of Representatives
majority shrank from 32 to 2, Labor
was defeated by nearly 6000 votes, but
in 1961 when the Government won back
20 seats its majority in Corio dropped
to 3000.
The two major reasons for this un-
representative electoral behaviour were
that in 1963 Labor had a very strong
candidate in Mr. Bob Hawke, the
ACTU industrial advocate and at the
time unemployment in the city of Gee-
long, which is the heart of the Corio
seat, was worse than in 1961. Geelong
is heavily dependent on retail spend-
ing on Ford motor cars, tractors,
trucks, and their parts, and in 1963
Ford was having a lean time. As a re-
sult, more than 20 percent of Victoria’s
long-term unemployed lived in Gee-
long.
In 1966 Corio returned Federal Min-
ister for Immigration, Opperman, with
a majority of 8000, not a great deal of
which should be put down to his per-
sonal popularity in the district. Now
that Mr. Opperman is off to Malta the
Liberals expect to hold the seat, even
Air Marshal Sir George Jones. .. his
third party.
if with a slightly reduced majority.
Ford are doing well enough and none
of the candidates stands out much as
likely to get a personal vote.
A gentle note of relief is supplied
by the candidature of Air Marshal Sir
George Jones. Sir George is running
for the Liberal Reform Group. After
he retired from the Air Force in 1952
he joined the Liberal Party and stood
for Liberal pre-selection a couple of
times. He resigned in 1958 in protest
against Parliamentary pay rises. In
1961 he stood as Labor candidate for
Henty and was defeated. A few weeks
ago he joined party number three. Sir
George thinks that the UN should be
allowed to establish a peace-keeping
force in Vietnam.
Canberra
Chairs and stairs
THE CRACKS IN Commonwealth-
States relations that flowed from the
Premiers’ Conference appeared in sym-
bolic form in King’s Hall, Parliament
House, last week.
Two months ago, amid great pomp
and ceremony, in the presence of
Prime Minister Holt, President of the
Senate Sir Alister McMullin, Acting-
Speaker of the House of Representatives
Mr. Lucock, and the national president
of the RSL Sir Arthur Lee, the RSL
presented to Parliament two carved
wooden chairs for public use in King’s
Hall the League’s 50th anniversary
gift-
Sir Alister emotionally assured Sir
Arthur the chairs, each backed with
three panels incorporating the carved
replicas of the State symbols, would
always have a place in the present
Parliament House and in the new,
when built.
Last w 7 eek two overalled removalists
stole through dimly lit King’s Hall
late one afternoon and disappeared into
the fast descending dusk with both
chairs and the League’s pride. But not
before our man had pounced and
found both chairs had suffered in the
heated confines of King’s Hall. The
glue had dried and the panels had
cracked.
Could he be justified in seeing a
sinister connotation in the fact that the
longest, deepest, and widest crack cut
right through the N.S.W. waratah?
But while Parliament House lost its
chairs last w r eek it gained something
else two new r bronze railings on the
front steps to help aging politicians,
visiting dignitaries, and (the powers
that be are most insistent and vocal on
this point) aging tourists to navigate
the first steps in the climb to the seat
of powder.
All this for $35 a foot, as the total
cost of the contract for the specially
cast railings to help the aged negotiate
the 13 steps into political life was a
mere $1385.
Young Liberals
Got to be kidding
THE YOUNG LIBERALS have done
it again. First, in Queensland, they
pushed through to the Party conference
a resolution favoring legalised abortion
in limited circumstances, for instance
after rape; in Adelaide they encouraged
Mr. Andrew Jones to venture into pop
lyrics; and now, in Western Australia,
they have amazed their seniors by
swinging the vote at State conference
for a motion to legalise prostitution.
Andrew Jones. .. pop lyrics
It has staggered even close Liberal
followers that this apparently frivolous
measure got so far being passed
105-97 after two shows of hands, and
finally after delegates had been asked
to stand and be counted. At this stage
the proxies held by the Young Liberals
who put forward the motion with
the backing of one of the lesser parlia-
mentary figures, Dr. Guy Henn
swung the vote.
One of the main speakers to the
motion was 22-year-old Miss Jean
Angus, who claimed that “there are
men, who, because of their circum-
stances of employment, cannot be with
their wives or are separated from
female companionship. I feel these are
the reasons why prostitution is going
to continue.” The Young Liberals
president, Anthony Pestell, in half
heartedly bringing the motion forward,
said that because prostitution exists it
should be controlled. Mrs. J. W. O’May,
president of the party’s State Women s
Council, pointed out that prostitution
was equated by the United Nations with
slavery; she strongly opposed it.
But it went through and has been
greeted with a “they’ve got to be
kidding” attitude. If the Government
or any member were bold (or stupid)
enough to give the motion legislative
framework, they would be cut to rib-
bons by the Opposition.

Lloyd Dumas of the ‘Advertiser’
By DAVID McNICOLL
IT WOULD BE a difficult—perhaps
an impossible task to find a person
in Australia who disliked Lloyd
Dumas. To be able to say this of an
ordinary citizen in business is most
unusual; to say it of a newspaper chief
is phenomenal.
Sir Lloyd Dumas, who retires this
month as boss of the Adelaide “Adver-
tiser,” has always been by nature a
placator. His voice is oiled with that
particular lubricant used for pouring
on troubled waters. His deprecatory
gentle manner is designed for turning
away wrath. His ruddy cheeks are
always at the ready—one or other—
to be turned as the Gospel directs.
Over the years he has stood—looking
benign and slightly puzzled as his
fellow proprietors have quarrelled and
argued. And often, in the end, the
Placator has managed to draw the
lusty dissenters together the soft
voice of Adelaide soothing the turbu-
lent giants of Sydney and Melbourne.
Sir Lloyd Dumas ... placator
There are three Lloyd Dumas’: one
is a really fine newspaper man; a
second is the Adelaide clubman-and-
host par excellence; the third is a
passionate family man, for whom life
lost much of its savor when an adored
wife died a few years ago.
The newspaper man? Well, Lloyd
Dumas has built his own monuments
in his own city. A journalist of dis-
tinction, he had not only a great
capacity for hard work but he had
imagination and resourcefulness. It
was 61 years ago that he came from
Mt. Barker to join the “Advertiser” as
its most junior staff member.
In 1915 he left Adelaide, and did
not return until 1929 when he came
back as managing editor of the “Adver-
tiser.” In the intervening years his
career was varied a stint on the
Melbourne “Argus,” as Federal rounds-
man; a trip to the Imperial Conference
with Billy Hughes in 1918; editorship of
the “Sun-Pic” in 1924; and in 1927 sent
to London to manage and edit the Aus-
tralian Newspapers Cable service, from
which stemmed the Australian Associ-
ated Press.
Back in Adelaide Lloyd Dumas not
only consolidated himself as a fine
newspaperman he also established
himself as a most important piece of
Adelaide life. Everyone knew Lloyd
Dumas. Everyone with a problem, a
suggestion which might benefit South
Australia, beat a path to his door. What
might to outsiders seem a parochial
aura which wraps Adelaide and South
Australia was a desirable cocoon so far
as Sir Lloyd Dumas was concerned.
Like Sir Thomas Playford, he held the
view that anything South Australia
did must be right.
His profit-making ability was never
in question. It is a comparatively easy
task in a city with a morning paper
monopoly, but even so, Sir Lloyd never
allowed unnecessary lavishness to cut
into dividends. He was to the fore-
front in pioneering Tasmanian news-
print, he was one of the earliest appli-
cants for a radio licence, and when
TV came, his station was first on the
air.
Inasmuch as the “Advertiser” was
a Murdoch paper, Dumas was a Keith
Murdoch man. A close friend, a board
member of the Melbourne “Herald”—
but nevertheless Dumas managed to
keep an independence about the “Adver-
tiser,” which gave the lie to anyone
accusing him of being a Murdoch
lackey. Lloyd Dumas had unshakeable,
Adelaide-style convictions, and nobody
ever undertook the unrewarding task
of diverting him from them.
Those who gently smile at Sir Lloyd
see him as the embodiment of the
Adelaide Club. Well, he is a club-
man, and proud of it. And if the
Adelaide Club side of him brackets
him in the observer’s mind with Barr
Smiths, and Hawkers, and Downers,
and Bonythons - well, it is merely
that in the rather insular little world of
Adelaide, Lloyd Dumas is, with the
others, part of The Establishment.
His reputation as a host is prodigious.
He loves good wine and knows a lot
about it. He is never happier than when
entertaining. His kindness is a legend.
I, for one, will never forget his
thoughtfulness and generosity, his
encouragement to a young man fairly
newly launched in journalism. In his
own paper he has always been
approachable his door open to any-
one on his staff, his temperament such
that he is happy to help people with
their domestic or economic problems.
This facet of Lloyd Dumas’ charac-
ter probably stems from his having had
a fantastically happy private life. For
those fortunate enough to have met
Sir Lloyd and his wife and his three
daughters it was quite an experience
Their obvious enjoyment of each
other’s company used to warm anv
room in which they were together
Sir Lloyd will be 76 when he gets
off the “Advertiser” board. But al-
though he leaves the paper, he will still
be a big wheel in Adelaide affairs
business, civic, and cultural. Retire-
ment from all that is a long way off.
If he were 20 years younger, he
would have been a natural for
appointment as an Ambassador
perhaps to the Middle East. That un-
pleasant business between Egypt and
Israel just wouldn’t have happened if
Sir Lloyd had been about.
Western Australia
Fish and Meat
BEHIND THE WEST’S mineral dis-
coveries lies another story with aspects
important to Australia’s future—W.A.’s
growing part in producing protein food,
especially beef and fish, to help feed
the people of the world.
Optimists of the industry believe
that, just as prawns are beginning to
rival the traditional crayfish, tuna will
eventually outstrip them both. This
assumes that the tuna sighted from the
air in schools of up to 15 tons can, in
fact, be caught. To do the job Fisheries
has imported South Australian Ken
Tidswell, said to be Australia’s ace
tuna skipper, and chartered the 82ft.
South Australian tuna boat Estelle Star.
The British-owned Ross fishing
group, confident of tuna’s future, is
working on a basis of 200 tons from
this boat over the next few weeks. Early
next month the company’s managing
director, Mr. Theo Kailis, goes to Japan
and America’s west coast to negotiate
firm markets. He believes that next
season more than 2000 tons of tuna
can be caught in the State’s far north,
attracting fishermen from inter-State,
notably South Australia.
Ross Fisheries are working with Syd-
ney builder Eric Clementson’s Norwest
Development Corporation Ltd., using
the group’s meatworks at Wyndham and
Broome for processing tuna. From there
they can be sent direct to market.
If catches are up to expectations,
Ross will build their own works in the
north. The Clementson group, mean-
while, is locked in a tough competitive
battle with the rival meatworks at
Katherine, whose owners Northern
Meat Exporters Pty. Ltd. they out-
bid for the formerly State-owne
Wyndham meatworks. However, the
Clementson owned Broome meatworks,
in the West Kimberleys, is standing up
to competition from the Derby wor s,
and hopes to maintain last y ear
throughput of 23,300 despite an overa
weaker season.


New Guinea
With the wind
Territories Minister Barnes ... mending
ALTHOUGH THE NECESSITY for it
is demonstrated almost daily, it seems
that old assumptions are not so easily
shed. Territories Minister Barnes
proved it with his statements in New
Guinea last month when at one stroke
he managed to antagonise “loyalists”
like the member for Wewak-Aitape,
Mr. Simogun Pita, and “nationalists”
like Mr. Oala Rarua and the supporters
of the Committee of Thirteen.
While Mr. Simogun’s reactions have
not been reported, Pangu Pati spokes-
men were obviously bitter. “It is a
pity,” said a statement from its interim
executive, “that a man in Mr. Barnes’
position should repeatedly make these
blundering and uninformed pronounce-
ments about us and our country.”
The next day the entire executive
of the Papua-New Guinea Police As-
sociation resigned in protest against
alleged attempts by the Administration
to conrol their union. These events may
be only a foretaste of what is to come.
Last week Mr. Barnes tried to
mend some of the rips in the canvas
by stressing that his earlier “no seventh
State” view had been “for the time
being,” that Territorians might really
be thinking of some looser association,
short of absorption within Australia,
when they referred to a “seventh State,”
and that it would be best not to be too
n gid in planning for an unpredictable
future.
Meanwhile in tiny, far off Nauru,
recently promised independence by
January 31, the locals learned that
their delegation, led by Head Chief
Hammer De Roburt, is flying to

straws in the wind, of course, but all

increasing number of our colonial sub-
jects are already anticipating the joys
°f independence.
COMMENT
Without big brother
AUSTRALIANS USED to see the development of their nationhood
in military terms. We “became a nation” when our expedition proved
itself in the Gallipoli campaign. However what Gallipoli established
was something different: and that was that we saw ourselves as a minor
expeditionary power, allied to a Great Power on whose strength we
ultimately depended, but we were ready to pay the price of this alliance.
This “little brother” role was confirmed in later wars, but now events
are making a new demand on us and these demands provide another
test of nationhood, of brotherhood without big brother.
The leaders of the Governments of both Singapore and Malaysia have
now publicly indicated that they are looking to Australia and New
Zealand to make up some of the weight that will be lost as the British
pull out. In this case we are not being asked to come to the aid of a
Great Power, in whom we hope to find our own security. We are being
asked instead to help nourish security in two powers that are smaller
than we are (but whose security is nevertheless related to our own).
Although this is the first time in our military history that we have
been asked to be a power-in-our-own-right, the politics of major power
alliance nevertheless lie behind it. If we expect America to be a military
ally of ours, the Americans may very well expect us to do for smaller
powers some of what they do for us. In this way, by accepting respon-
sibilities of our own, we make ourselves a better ally. So far as the
British are concerned, it is in our interests that they should keep
strength of some kind in the area, even if it is only naval and air strength,
but we are not going to have much of a case in dealing with them if we
ask them to do what we are not prepared to do ourselves.
There are those who, puzzled by the problems involved in commit-
ments in South-East Asia, contemplate a disengagement, in the insular
manner, and a concentration on Australia’s own defences. This might
appear to make some kind of hard-headed sense if it involved a massive
increase, at very great economic and social cost, of Australia’s defences,
but even then it risks precipitating that complete abandonment by the
British which otherwise might not happen. And where would it put us
with the Americans?
However, in urging a more complicated involvement in Singapore and
Malaysia, one should not ignore its dangers. One of these is that we
might be developing a special relationship with two powers in an area
in which we also have a general interest and that this might pull us into
situations which for the moment we cannot foresee—into being expected
to take sides against another nation with which we are also friendly, for
example, or, in an extreme case, to take sides as between the two
nations with which we are allied. There would have to be some honest
discussion between the Anzac powers and Malaysia and Singapore about
the purposes of our commitment.
It seems particularly important in our part of the world that the
nations in it should learn to be friendly even when they differ. Mr.
Hasluck was right last week when he told the Asian and Pacific Council
that there should be room within it for widely differing points of view,
that it should not try to do everything itself and that building a sense
of regional co-operation was best attempted through a diversity of
institutions.
It should nevertheless be the hope of Australian policy that finally, at
some time or other, there should be a common concern with their own
security among the nations of the Malay Archipelago and the South-
West Pacific, even if they differ on other matters or are engaged in
other alliances. Perhaps this could finally be formalised as an Oceanic
Alliance, between Malaysia, Singapore, Indonesia, the Philippines,
Australia, and New Zealand, but it should not be pushed too quickly,
and it must come from discussion between these nations, not on outside
initiative. If we enter into special relations with Singapore and Malaysia
we should do so with the aspiration at the back of our heads that such a
wider alliance should be the desirable end of policy and that any special
arrangements made in the meantime should not hinder it.


HENRY
BOLTE
The boy
from the bush
By BRIAN BUCKLEY
A LABOR MEMBER of the Upper
House told me, “The man has a cruel
streak in him”; a well-bred anti-hanging
lady said, “The fellow’s a twentieth-
century throwback, a savage”; a
younger member of the Parliamentary
Liberal Party said, “He acts the tough
guy at times, but he’s basically a
generous sort of bloke”; a boyhood
friend reckoned, “As a kid he was a
natural leader, with perhaps a streak
of the larrikin in him, too”; a member
of his Government staff claimed, “He’s
a marvellous chap to work for, efficient,
relaxed, and very considerate.”
In part, politicians act as screens on
which people project their fears, affec-
tions, and fantasies. For these purposes
Sir Henry Bolte serves his State better
than most Premiers, and, more un-
usually, serves the nation. Even before
the Ryan hanging he had emerged as
the Premier of the day. In the general
pool of rather mundane State leaders
there always seems to be one around
who rises into focus as a special
national figure. In the ’3os it was Jack
Lang in New South Wales, more
recently Sir Thomas Playford in South
Australia, and now it is the unlikely
turn of Victoria’s Sir Henry.
Unlikely because when he won the
Premiership of Victoria—“the greatest
little State in Australia,” he calls it
he was dubbed “Billy from the Bush”
by his parliamentary opponents and
“Caretaker Premier” by the political
correspondents. Nobody could see in
him then the qualities necessary to
achieve a record period of office. It
was generally agreed that he had won
the No. 1 desk in the Treasury more
by chance than good politics.
To his opponents the chain of cir-
cumstances must seem almost anti-
providential:
• While Bolte was well down in the
ranks, the Leader of the Parliamentary
Liberal Party, Mr. Tom Hollway, was
deposed in one of the Party’s intermin-
able faction fights and replaced by Mr.
Les Norman.
• The Liberal Party had a tradition
of meeting challenges from the Country
Party by electing both a city and a
country member to the two leadership
positions.
• Since Norman was from the city and
there were few country members left
in the Party, Bolte was elected to the
Deputy Leadership.
• Norman was defeated for the seat
of Glen Iris at the next election in a
grudge match with Hollway.
• Mr. Trevor Oldham, who was
elected Leader in place of Norman,
was killed in a Comet air crash on his
way to the Coronation in 1953 and
Bolte became Party Leader.
• The sudden fight between Dr. Evatt
and the “Movement,” split the Labor
Party in Victoria, and the minority,
which later became the DLP, deserted


Premier John Cain and forced an
election.
• The Labor Party lost heavily in the
1955 election and the Bolte-led Liberals
increased their numbers in the Legisla-
tive Assembly from a mere and little-
regarded 11 members to 34 in a day.
Much to the surprise of most citizens
of the State, a Western District farmer
was their new Premier.
In his clear-eyed agricultural way the
new Premier had noticed an important
factor in Australian politics. Today, he
puts it in these words: “The most im-
portant thing I learnt in my early days
was that you are rarely defeated from
without. Mostly, if not always, you are
first beaten from within. The electorate
simply comes along and confirms the
fact that the rot has set in.”
“Look at the Hollway Liberals,” he
says as he reaches for yet another small,
cork-tipped cigarette, “look at Labor in
’55 and since and they’re a mob that
mystify me and look at Hughes and
Lyons and Page and Bruce and the
early Menzies. All the same, beaten
from within. Well, when I became
Premier I wasn’t going to let it happen
to me.”
He grins in acknowledgement of his
own conceit as he adds, “And it won’t.”
The task of remaining in office has
not been so difficult. On the inside
there are few strong and destructively
ambitious men in Cabinet; the back-
benchers are more tractable than their
Federal counterparts. The Labor
Party’s parliamentary wing suffers from
the utterly discredited Executive
machine which chooses its membership,
and even a strong Labor Opposition
could never overcome the barrier of
DLP preferences.
He is proud of his ability to keep the
Party together, though he does it less
with forethought than with the instinc-
tive application of the permissiveness
and psychological force of the natural
leader. But his greatest pride is in what
he calls “State development.” More
than any Premier in Australia’s history
he has set himself to bring national and
foreign capital into his State. His trips
overseas, he explains, are to “sell Vic-
toria”; the Opposition agrees with the
term, but changes the emphasis.
But to most liberal and some Liberal
opinion the economic achievements
count for little when balanced against
his penal policies. To these he is the
man who allowed the flogging of
O’Meally and Taylor, who tried to
hang the insane Robert Peter Tait, who
hanged Ronald Ryan. One is still often
asked the questions: Is he some kind
of sadist? Is cruelty to criminals a
weakness in Bolte just as the hounding
of allegedly dirty books is a weakness
with his Deputy, Mr. Arthur Rylah?
More illuminating than amateur
psychoanalysis is the exchange which
occurred in the Victorian Lower House
over the Police Offences (Trap Shoot-
lng) Bill in 1958. The Bill had been
introduced as a private member’s mea-
sure by Mr. John Galbally (ALP) in
the Upper House and then proceeded
to the Legislative Assembly, where it
was handled by Labor’s Mr. Val Doube.
Mr. Doube talked of some cruel
incidents in which gaiahs had been
released from their cages and shot at
and then fluttered away wounded, some
to be finished off by boys who were paid
to jump on the birds’ heads and others
to flutter around in pain for the rest
of their lives.
Mr. Doube continued: “I suppose a
decision on what is cruel and what is
not cruel so far as the treatment of ani-
mals is concerned depends to some
extent on the standard of civilisation
in the community . . . what definitely
has altered is the attitude toward these
matters.”
Mr. Bolte (interjecting): “The law
of the jungle has not altered.”
Mr. Doube: “. . . The law of the
jungle is not tolerated in our com-
munity.”
Mr. Bolte: “It operates in the animal
kingdom.”
Mr. Doube: “. . . It is interesting to
note that in the jungle there is no
cruelty.”
Mr. Bolte: “Rubbish. Cats eat birds
every day.”
Mr. Doube: “. . . Most animals eat to
obtain food.”
Mr. Bolte: “Cats kill for sport.”
Mr. Doube then referred to the out-
lawing of cruel sports such as bull bait-
ing and cock fighting, a statement which
earned the rejoinder from the Premier:
“What is the difference between a
couple of birds and a couple of men
having a scrap?”
After this unexpected exchange the
Premier rose to the defence of the
sport of trap shooting. “I believe,” he
said, “the sport should be allowed to
continue. The day I am convinced that
it is cruel to the degree of or in excess
of normal field shooting or the ordin-
ary way of life of the average country
person, I will support its being banned
. . . If one lives in the country one has
a constant battle against the elements.
Fire, flood, tempest, drought, pesti-
lence, and other things mould one’s
character . . .
“One has to live by the elements,”
he concluded, “to understand the real-
ities of life. Unless people have ex-
perienced life in the country . . . they
do not fully appreciate what is and
what is not cruel.”
Mr. Galbally, the Labor MLC who
had promoted the Bill in the Upper
House, he dismissed with the contemp-
tuous observation that he probably
“never had a gun in his hand in his
life.”
In that parliamentary episode, more
than in anything else, the character of
Henry Bolte may be seen: his philo-
sophy of nature and life, his simplicity,
his visceral logic, his rustic realism.
“Rubbish! Cats eat birds every day.”
His tone indicates that anybody who
can’t see that is a sentimental fool. His
parliamentary language is rather the
same. To the former leader of the
Opposition, Mr. Stoneham, he said a
few years ago: “When the Honorable
Member was a Minister he stood by
his officers also and accepted their
recommendations. If he did not he is
a greater mug than I take him to be.”
He often accuses the men on the Oppo-
sition benches of “squibbing the issue.”
The bucolic cliche rolls off easily: to
a query I made in a recent interview
he laughed before replying: “I’m bug-
gered if I know.”
In the same interview he revealed his
lack of concern for oral logic. “As a
man who has made four extensive trips
abroad and three or four minor ones,
what do you think are the differentiat-
ing features of Australian national
character?” I asked.
“Well,” he said, “my analysis is a
bit critical. The average Australian is
inclined to be pretty smug and self-
satisfied—though we have some reason
to be —and Australians are certainly not
bashful, though because of this they
are well known.”
A minute or so later he told me that
Australia was handicapped by a lack
of a sense of self-importance.
The explanation for such a contra-
"HE ACTS THE TOUGH
GUY AT TIMES, BUT HE'S
BASICALLY A
GENEROUS SORT OF BLOKE"


HENRY BOLTE
THE BOY FROM THE BUSH
diction is largely that what he knows
he knows well mostly things like
names, places, figures—and the rest he
doesn’t care about much. It can be
amusing in the parliamentary gallery,
watching some of the more cerebral
members of the Opposition trying to
come to grips with the Premier’s argu-
ments. It is a forlorn task, like trying
to hold natural gas in a net. There is no
deductive logic to be grasped, only a
strongly stated position and rather ran-
dom examples produced in support.
I asked him if he thought his Govern-
ment should do more in the field of
social welfare and social services; was
it hampered in this area by lack of
finance? He explained that he was
opposed to an excess of Government
control and Government interference,
that people should not come to rely
on Governments too much: “I would
hate to think that social services were
the basis of a man’s thinking, and the
need for them will diminish as society
grows more prosperous.”
As an afterthought he added: “Any-
way, politicians can’t campaign on
social services and benefits these days.”
A while later he mentioned rather
ineptly, exemplifying another point, the
aphorism: “It’s a bit like the poor.
They will always be with you.”
Yet the Premier has a reputation
for personal kindness. A former Labor
member of State Parliament remembers
that when he lost his seat some years
ago he was invited into the Treasury
offices and offered financial and per-
sonal help to tide him over a lean
period or to set himself up in a small
business.
There is a strong rumor in parliamen-
tary corridors that Sir Henry has
established some kind of fund to assist
defeated State politicians, and on a non-
Party basis. He gave not the slightest
hint of it when I asked him if he wor-
ried about the fate of defeated par-
liamentarians who had no private busi-
ness, farm, or profession. He spoke
for some time on their plight, and
sincerely, but suggested no solution. In
passing he contrasted his own position
as a successful farmer who “was in
Parliament for a week before it
occurred to me to ask someone how
much we got.”
Henry Edward Bolte, who was 59
last May, is fond of calling himself a
son of the soil. He was born at Skip-
ton, an old gold town of the Western
District. His parents had a hotel there
until he was about 16, when they moved
on to a small farm. The education
of young Henry took place at Skipton
State School, Ballarat Grammar, and
various shearing sheds and sheep runs
(he once joined the Australian Workers’
Union) in the west of the State. One
of the myths about him is that he was
a dud at school and left early because
he was advised to. In fact, he was
good enough to win two scholarships
in the days when they were hard to
get. He left school because he wanted
to be a farmer.
In 1934 he bought the property of
1100 acres, which he still owns, at
Bamganie near Meredith “for less than
the cost of an average home today.”
“Kialla” then carried 600 merinos. To-
day it shears about 4000, and nearly
four sheep to the acre is considered to
be highly efficient farming in most
parts of Australia.
He and his wife worked from 1934
until the outbreak of war trying to
“survive” on “Kialla.” He topped the
local market prices for wool in 1935
but says that things were pretty tough
for some time. He volunteered as a
gunner in 1940. Flat feet ruled him out
of consideration for overseas service
and he served as an instructor at
Puckapunyal. Like Mr. Askin, Premier
of New South Wales, he finished the
war a sergeant. ,
In the local district he had captained
the football and cricket teams, and
been the secretary of both the Anglican
Church and the racing club. It was not
surprising that the lion of Meredith was
persuaded to stand for State Parliament
at the end of the war. A born winner,
losing must have come as a shock. But
two years later, urged by his former
schoolmate Tom Hollway, he stood
and ran more truly to form. He entered
Parliament in 1947 without much poli-
tical philosophy “but opposed to con-
trols, and a conservative with a great
admiration for former Prime Minister
Bruce.”
His first speech in the House has
been christened by one wag the “More
Power to the Local Brigades” speech. It
began: “I had no desire to make my
maiden effort this side of Christmas, but
on travelling in the country I find the
fire danger so great this year that those
of us who represent country areas must
stress the importance of fire control
and prevention. I have had practical
experience of fire-brigade work. I am
president of Meredith fire brigade . . .”
(the House might have guessed). There
followed a plea for more power to the
local brigades and landowners for
burning-off. The speech lasted about
ten minutes, but the future Premier
managed to use the singular personal
pronoun 25 times in that period.
A year later he was Minister of Water
Supply and Mines under the direction
of Hollway. For the next six years his
speeches were devoted almost entirely
to country matters: water, soldier
settlement, wheat stabilisation, rural
roads. Not much of national impor-
tance, but one on an international, or at
least a Commonwealth, topic: “. .. in
a very small district I had the pleasure
and pride of running a Meat for
Britain campaign. The results were
outstanding and astounding.” Despite
his partly Germanic origins he con-
stantly referred to Britain as
“Mother Country.”
There followed the sequence of events
which led to the Premier’s desk i n
Treasury Place. He broke Sir Albert
Dunstan’s State record in 1965 and has
now been in office for 12 years, work-
ing 80 hours a week, smoking 40 cigar-
ettes a day, drinking ample on the rare
occasions he can find the time. A senior
Labor member claimed last week that
anybody could have done the same
given Sir Henry’s advantages.
The advantages of a booming
economy, a fractured Labor Party, and
a tractable Parliamentary Liberal
Party certainly must be granted, but
few men have the Bolte brand of burn-
ing yet not unattractive egoism, relent-
less energy, shrewd grasp of men’s
weaknesses, and natural bluff. Treasury
officials are in no doubt that very
few have his quick arithmetical abilities
and insight into the direction of statis-
tics.
Despite his love for the land and its
products nobody could have kept him
down on the farm for ever, and the
first three months of his first Ministry
immediately displayed the driving
energy which had brought him to the
State capital. In that time almost 99
Bills went through the Lower House.
Some of his Ministers found the pace
more than enough.
The Premier was busy not only with
legislation but with planning his first
overseas “sell Victoria” trips. In the
trips since, he has met most of the
Western world’s industrial and political
leaders. “America’s Nixon,” he says,
“was the most impressive politician
among them. I felt that he was the
kind of man America needed. He had
the right kind of background and know-
ledge. He was most impressive.” There
was a note of scorn in his attitude to-
ward some of the leading Englishmen.
“Let’s just say the English politicians
were typical English politicians. Some
of them let you down.”
Challenged on his own front that
he makes a lot of noise about the in-
justice of Commonwealth-State finan-
cial relations without using any long-
term strategy toward changing things, he
shrugs and says: “You do your best to
point out the inequities, but at the
Premiers’ Conference and on the Loan
Council you get out-voted by those
getting a better deal than Victoria. The
Government can buy off the smaller
States if they cause too much trouble.’
Although his record as a State
developer is outstanding in any com-
pany, Sir Henry is conscious of his lack
of success in winning a sound financial
base for State Government finances. He
feels he is caught two ways: by the
Commonwealth and other States on
one side and by the electors’ refusal to
tolerate a new State tax on the other.
He knows that the only solution is for
the Commonwealth to hand back one
of its taxing powers to the States but
cannot devise a strategy to win this
objective. In this regard, as he himself
might say, he is not Robinson Crusoe.

THE TIES THAT BIND FOREVER
Harold Holt ...
Wesley

Sydney High

Timbertop
ONCE A MONTH the English Public
Schools Association meets for lunch in
Sydney. One of their members, now in
his late eighties, went to Harrow with
Winston Churchill. This Old Boy
doesn’t make it every time and he
doesn’t go to mixed social events,
because his dancing days are over, but
he wears his badge and his old school
tie.
There are still several Old Girls from
Rose Bay Convent who were among
the original pupils in 1880. They cer-
tainly don’t join in the annual Parents
versus Girls Tennis Day, but they are
still very interested in the Rose Bay
Sacre Coeur Society.
Members of Sydney Grammar’s Old
Sydneians have just gone back to
school for the 1920-and-back reunion.
Old Boys included Mr. Russell French,
who left in 1898, and Mr. J. Chound-
ling, who was sent forth into the world
a year later.
In Sydney there is even an enthusias-
tic Old Girls’ Union for a school which
no longer exists. The women who
belong to the Shirley College Union
tenaciously cling to the ghostly
memories of a school at Edgecliff,
which seems to have been there in an
on-and-off manner for about a hundred
years until 1935.
Now they appear to pay homage to
“Shirley,” a block of fiats in the Edge-
cliff area. But Mrs. Fergus Munro, the
school’s staunchest historian, says that
the ghost school, although small
never more than 130 pupils—produced
three Olympic sportswomen, this in
spite of such formality as the white
gloves worn for shaking hands with
the teachers as they entered class.
All over the country and, in fact,
all over the world, Old Girl and Old
Boy associations flourish, trying to keep
hallowed the brief sojourn their mem-
bers had in one particular place.
But although Old Boys’ associations
have existed for a good many years,
today being an Old Boy is a much
more serious affair. At almost every
school it means being associated with
the school’s survival. The Old Boys’
tie carries the privilege of paying for
your school until you die.
The Old Boys’ Ticket can mean
hard labor today as well as money.
The classic case at the moment is the
Back to Timbertop week being held
at Geelong Grammar. All old Timber-
top chaps are being invited to return
there for a week at the end of the
school year in December. So far, 80
have said they will.
They will spend half their time
mending fences and doing general
maintenance work. The rest of the
time they will spend seeing if they
still have the old Timbertop muscles,
walking the odd 50 miles, and that
sort of thing. One trusts, of course,
that Prince Charles has his invitation.
But hard cash is more often the
rule than hard labor. Most of the large
Melbourne boys’ schools at the moment
have appeals, organised by the Old
Boys and managed by Wells or some
such organisation.
Par for the course for a big school
is $1 million. Geelong Grammar,
Xavier, Wesley, Scotch, Melbourne
Grammar, Carey are all in it. Wesley
has raised just a million to build the
new junior school at Syndal. Scotch
has raised nearly a million, and Gee-
long Grammar has raised $707,000.
Our Melbourne correspondent, Bat-
man, an old hand among Old Boys,
recalls that when he was a new boy
his parents never met any of his
teachers and had no desire whatsoever
to do so. The young Batman felt that
this was the way it should be; school
and parents should be kept utterly
apart.
In those far-off days it was much
the same with Old Boys. Old Boys’
Day was like Anzac Day, the One Day
of the Year, and looked upon with
a certain amount of misery at the
school. It was arranged usually on
the day of a good football match. The
Old Boys would arrive, particularly
the young ones in their MGs, 30/98
Vauxhalls, and such, beat it up around
the school oval, provide cheer squads
for the match, attend the Old Boys’
meeting, have dinner at school, then
go home. That was all.
Perhaps the most active Old Boys’
Union in Sydney is Sydney High’s.
Sydney High is a Great Public School
arid a central high school and, as well,
the oldest high school in Australia.
In any case, the High Old Boys
seem to be a race apart. They have
their own Masonic Lodge and their
own licensed club, happily called the
High Club. Puns run cheerily through
the group. Their annual ball is the
Highball.
The club premises in York Street
are unpretentious, although new plans
are pinned up on the hotice-board.
Above the bar is a picture of the
Queen, but opposite, from floor to
ceiling, is a mural in glowing color of
the Boys of High Today standing self-
consciously in the playground.
On the notice-board are the names
of proposed new members a clerk,
a grazier, a radio announcer. Among
the 700 members of the High Old
Boys’ Union (most belong to the club)
is the Governor of N.S.W., Sir Roden
Cutler.
There are poker machines at the club
but they are few and far between.
The club is mainly for the quiet lunch
(provided by the War Widows), the
quiet drink, and any money raised
goes back to the old school.
The oldest Old Boys of Sydney High
are the Mary Anners. They meet once
a month for a most exclusive lunch.
Sydney High moved from the place
where David Jones’ main store is now
to Mary Anne Street in the 19205, and
the last boy from the old building left
by 1928; Mary Anners are becoming
rare specimens.
In New South Wales there is a
great difficulty with Old Boys’ clubs.
Boys leave school at 17 and 18, can
become members of the union, but
cannot become members of the clubs
until they are 21.
The English Public Schools Associa-
tion is very correct about its group.
Intending members must provide evi-
dence that they really did attend the
school, and the schools are only those
affiliated with the Headmasters’ Con-
ference in England.
Top of the heap is Eton, of course,
and as the gentlemen mill around at
luncheons and dinners there can be
little doubt that there is a certain
hierarchy. The president, Mr. Charles
Buchanan, describes them as “non-
disgruntled migrants,” and says the
Association is always anxious to build
up the members by contacting new
boys. ,
The Englishmen meet at the Schools
Club, formed in 1928 by Scots, Shore,
King’s, Newington, and Grammar. The
Schools’ Club has a licence, 1400 mem-
bers, and five poker machines. It lS
affiliated with other clubs overseas
which are in the Great Public Schools
tradition, and provides squash, bil-
liards, snooker, lunch, and the annua
dinner. Profits (it costs about $25 a
year to belong) go back into the club.
Perhaps the most active of the Old
Boys in Melbourne are Scotch. They
have an annual dinner at Melbourne
University Union, usually with a roll-
up of around 500. They have a
monthly luncheon at the Victoria.
Wesley, too, has devoted Old Boys.
They have an annual Founders’ Day
with more than 300 for the dinner.
Actually, they can work their PR
rather well at the moment. For the
past two dinners they had a guest-of-
honor Old Boy Sir Robert Menzies,
then Old Boy Harold Holt. One trusts
they will keep up the pace for the
next. Scotch are the most devoted
Old School tie wearers, and you must
have your form from the Old Boys’
Association to get your tie. Next among
Old School tie wearers in Melbourne
are Melbourne Grammar and then,
perhaps, Xavier.
There used to be Old Melburnians
and Old Scotch Collegians who, it is
reported, wore their OB ties in the
bath and even with dressing-gown at
breakfast, but it is a dying habit.
Once, for the first few years after
leaving school, one wore an OB tie
constantly, to say nothing of a school
stickpin. Stickpins are now completely
out. In other times, one exchanged
stickpins with one’s beloved; now the
young OBs exchange protest badges
like “JESUS HAD LONG HAIR” or
“REALITY IS A CRUTCH.” OB
cufflinks, too, are fading, and we are
told sales are down for OB lampshades.
The school magazines mostly still
carry Old Boys’ notes, and it is pos-
sible to discover that Watson Major
is now a QC, and Smith Minor is a
Brigadier. OBs who are now in jail
or carting wood don’t get so much
space.
Our favorite OB note (names fic-
titious, no resemblance to any OB sub-
scriber, paid or unpaid) goes like this:
“Saw Featherstonhaugh-Smyth in
Collins Street yesterday. Featherston-
haugh-Smyth didn’t see me.”
Is any of this nonsense important
any more? In Australia, where Jack
was once supposed to be as good as
his master, familiarity with the grounds
of Geelong Grammar may still be just
as important as knowing that there
is a smoking tree at Shrewsbury in
England.
Few captains of industry will admit
it. The retail stores say they don’t care.
Heavy industry, in general, claim that
they look for ability only. But perhaps
Mr. Buchanan, of the English Public
Schools Association, was more honest.
“When I am employing someone,” he
said, “it has some bearing. It is not
exclusive. But it is easier to judge.”
To the question: “Do you find most
of your friends among your fellow Old
Boys?” the answer from one Old Boy
came, “Yes, but as one gets older one’s
horizons expand and one gets to know
other chaps from other years and other
schools, you know.”
The secretary of the Old Cran-
brookians Association (1014 members),
Mr. P. G. Harriman, thinks the private
school system is terribly expensive
but offers a boy exactly what he wants
to get out of it no more and no
less. (This probably accounts for the
shock an ex-English private-school boy
got when he found an old school pal
managing a pub in Paddington.)
The whole system of the Great Pub-
lic Schools crystallises in New South
Wales on the banks of the Nepean
River on Regatta Day each year.
There, despite the attempts of Univer-
sity of New South Wales students un-
successfully to send up the whole thing
by barracking for an imaginary school,
St. Slobs, the golden years are cele-
brated by people who have no link with
the boys now attending.
This year, after 47 years of effort,
King’s, the oldest and reputedly the
most expensive, stroked its way to vic-
tory for the second time in the history
of the race.
As all the King’s men, many of them
paunchy and bald, some waving their
walking-sticks, chanted “School, school,
school,” it surely wasn’t education they
were shouting about.
When they chant “School” at the Head, of the River, it surely isn’t education they are shouting about


The biggest of them all
Sir lan Potter:
how to retire and
not stop working
Sir lan (right) confers with Dr. H. C. Coombs
IF SIR lAN POTTER’S stepping-
down as senior partner of lan Potter
and Co., the stockbroking firm he
started in 1935 and made the hub of
the biggest local finance complex yet
developed in this country, meant his
departure from the Australian financial
scene, the loss would be irreparable.
Fortunately, it does not; that is, if the
idea he might be appointed to a senior
diplomatic post is discounted. For the
time being Potter intends to remain
almost as much in the thick of business
affairs here as ever. He is keeping his
seat on ’Change; he will stay in the
partnership; he will retain his director-
ships “and even add to them.” As he
puts it, “I’ll probably be busier than
ever.” It will be “busyness” with some
differences from his past.
Sir lan will no longer be directing
affairs at the focal point of the com-
plex. Even there, though, he has been
gradually easing out in favor of his
number two, Mr. C. T. Looker, chair-
man of the Stock Exchange of Mel-
bourne, who has been a partner at
Potters for the past fourteen years and
now takes over. The changeover is not
so much of power as of responsibility.
Sir lan’s handing over the reins at
the firm doesn’t, in fact, mean all that
much when viewed against his decision
to continue to command the super-
structure of the complex and to con-
tinue as a partner in the firm. Yet it
means a lot to him personally. The
firm is virtually his joy and pride.
The making of it and all it has done
to introduce new techniques into Aus-
tralian finance have been unique
achievements. He started it as a one-
man show in Melbourne when he left
the Treasury in the mid-’thirties. Al-
though well established, it was still
small in 1940 when the war claimed
Potter for three years in the Navy.
The take-off didn’t come until after the
war, when share price ceilings were
lifted (January, 1947). Thereafter,
Potter went all out with his inspired
efforts to finance industry in its recon-
struction and subsequent development
periods.
Potter’s national reputation as an
underwriter of new industrial and semi-
government issues was won against
strong '''competition and, to an extent,
at the expense of the Melbourne brok-
ing house of J. B. Were and Son. Until
Potter’s rise, Weres was in an unrivalled
position both in broking and under-
writing. As brokers, the clashes of these
giants, representing opposing clients to
takeover battles such as for Georges
and Swallows, are now legendary. Yet
Staniforth Ricketson, senior partner of
Weres, who also is soon to retire from
the field, cannot speak highly enough
of lan Potter for his contribution to the
sophistication of the Australian capital
market and for his leadership and com-
munity services.
The business world is highly indebted
to financiers like Potter and Ricketson
for their pioneering work in propelling
the Australian capital market into world
class. The process has meant a virtual
revolution in the marshalling and de-
ployment of capital in the past twenty
years. Its main architects have been
stockbrokers, who have built the super-
structure on their broking business. It
probably wouldn’t have happened with-
out people with the flair and ambition
of Potter, who had the necessary ex-
pertise for it and to initiate others into
the arts involved. lan Potter and Co.
was only one of several stock exchange
firms in Australia to build. general
financial services on top of their brok-
ing businesses since the war. It has been
the most successful of them all in
gathering and then deploying investment
funds over the whole commercial range.
Despite his present ideas of being
busier than before handing over to Mr.
Looker, it wouldn’t surprise if Sir lan
now scaled down his work and gave up
some of his many directorships. Mr.
Looker has long had a fist in a lot of
these particular Potter pies. As for the
finance subsidiary Australian United
Corporation, it is in highly experienced
executive hands. It is just possible Sir
lan’s golden touch (not that it always
works, as AUC’s involvement in the
Cox Bros, and Australian Factors
failures bear witness) is needed less
there these days than his magic name.
It would be all to Australia’s good if
Sir lan shed some of his present heavy
load in the local company world and
left himself more time to serve the
country’s international financial in-
terests. He has already given valuable
service in this field in several directions.
One is by bringing various merchant
banking firms from Britain and the
U.S. into the AUC orbit, so that in
this and other ways he has facilitated
the flow of overseas capital to this
country.
He has also successfully accomplished
a lot of official and informal liaison
work in overseas financial centres, with
Governments, and at various inter-
national finance conferences (the IMF
annual meetings, for example). What
is more, after such visits the business
world and our Governments have in-
variably been made the wiser from his
impressions of the prevailing world
economic climate. Being close both to
the present PM and Federal Treasurer,
from now on one would expect some of
his future “busyness” to be directed
along such national lines. He would
make an excellent financial ambassador-
at-large, in the manner, say, of Bernard
Baruch and Lord Keynes, men whose
calibre he would match.
Although a member of the Stock
Exchange committee for twenty years
(he left it five years ago), Sir lan was
always shy of suggestions from his col-
leagues that he would take over the
chair. This reluctance was very much in
keeping with his character and general
disposition to keep in the background
and not to protrude in a formal way
into public affairs. When the Melbourne
Stock Exchange held its monster sym-
posium on investment in Australia two
years ago, he preferred to be a spectator
only and left it to Mr. C. T. Looker to
wax hot with the S.E.’s critics. By
nature he has never been a front man
and has always appeared nervous on
public platforms arid with the Press.
The most daring of his excursions into
the communications media was a TV
interview with the Finance Editor of
the “Age” in 1960. His discomfort in
the course of it was obvious to every-
body. He kept rigorously to his notes,
which were not all that well concealed
from the cameras.
In his mellowing recent years, Sir
lan has been more forthcoming with
his views on affairs. But he still prefers
the private occasion to air them and
their espousal seems always meticulously
prepared.


OVERSEAS
China’s new war on the
road to Mandalay
CHINA HAS DECLARED war on her
neighbor and former staunch ally
Burma. Largely unnoticed because of
the absence of Western journalists in
Rangoon, the news has been coming
through over Peking Radio. Each
evening, for ten days now, its 6.30 news
bulletin has been thundering increas-
ingly fierce denunciations of what is
now referred to as the “reactionary Ne
Win military junta.” The beastly
Burmese have been regularly displac-
ing from first place in Radio Peking
newscasts such routine enemies as
U.S. imperialism in Vietnam, people
in authority taking the capitalist road,
and Soviet revisionism. Even the Glas-
boro talks commentary (“Soviet revis-
ionists discarded the last shred of
their tattered fig leaf, which has enabled
the people to see more clearly than ever
that this handful of renegades and scabs
are already rotten to the core”) was
given lower priority than the fierce
line against the former “progressive,
socialist, friend of the Chinese people.”
The current row started when
members of the Chinese Embassy in
Rangoon, in defiance of a newly
proclaimed Government regulation,
toured Chinese primary and middle
schools in the Burmese capital, giving
out Red Guard lapel badges bearing
the face of Chairman Mao. Several
day-long Red Guard type demonstra-
tions followed, and the Burmese Gov-
ernment ordered police to break them
up. There were further Chinese demon-
strations and counter-demonstrations
by Burman nationalists, and in one of
these a Chinese technical expert, in
Burma under China’s aid program, was
killed, and other Chinese injured. A
series of notes by the Chinese Govern-
ment protested that these “fascist
atrocities against China” had been
“wholly and deliberately engineered by
the reactionary Burmese Government.”
China’s whole propaganda machine
was geared up to an immense propa-
ganda campaign against Burma. “The
street in front of the Burmese Embassy
(in Peking) became an arena of
struggle for the Chinese people” as
over one million revolutionary people
participated in a mammoth demonstra-
tion to resolutely repulse the frantic
anti-China campaign of the Burmese
reactionaries. From morning to dusk,
revolutionary masses of all circles,
braving continuous spells of heavy
rain, marched before the Burmese
Embassy. They declared: ‘The Burmese
Government will come to no good end
by fawning on the United States and
allying with the Soviet Union to oppose
China.’ Clenching their fists, the
demonstrators shouted: ‘Blood debts
must be repaid with blood.’ ” Chou
En-lai was at Peking airport to receive
the casket of Liu Yi, the expert killed
in the rioting.
The declaration of war came in a
sudden discovery that, to quote one
note by the Chinese Government, “the
Burmese Government has landed itself
in a very difficult position and is hav-
ing a very hard time as a result of the
reactionary policy, against the Burmese
Communist Party and the people, which
it has pursued for a long time.” Peking
Radio has, therefore, been devoting
considerable time to broadcasting a
statement by the central committee of
Ne Win effigies outside Burma’s Peking
Embassy.. . getting the Red treatment
the BCP, which ends with the call for
the Burmese people to “unite and make
all-out efforts to develop and strengthen
the armed struggle, led by the Burmese
Communist Party, to defeat the tyranni-
cal rule of the Ne Win military Gov-
ernment, and establish a Government of
the people’s Democratic United Front.”
Over the years Burma developed
very close and cordial relations with
China. Burma was the ideal “Bandung
neutralist.” She was the first non-
Communist country to sign a “Treaty
of Friendship and Mutual Non-
Aggression” with China a border
agreement was signed in 1961; aid to
the tune of $Bl million was granted;
Chou En-lai and Chen Yi were frequent
visitors to Burma; and U Nu and Ne
Win were regular celebrities at Peking
rallies; the “Burmese Way to Social-
ism” provided for widespread nationali-
sation, the exclusion of private capital,
and the proclamation of Marxism as
the State ideology; all alliances and
involvement with the West have been
scrupulously avoided. As recently as
April last year, the Chinese Head of
State was in Rangoon on a goodwill
visit. All this seems now to have gone
in the wind of the Chinese “Cultural
Revolution.”
The Rangoon Government has, of
course, been plagued by various insur-
gency problems ever since its inde-
pendence in 1948. Its army of over
100,000 men has been continuously tied
up in attempting to establish internal
security against the attacks of local
Communists and minority-race dissi-
dents. Western intelligence estimates
put the current insurgent strength at
19,000 and say they control a good
one-third of the country, including all
the areas adjoining the Chinese pro-
vince of Yunnan.
Until recently the insurgency was
confined mainly to the less populated
outer and central areas, but in the past
few months there has been fighting
in the rice paddy areas of the Irra-
waddy delta. The insurgents are
operating mainly in groups of 40 to 100
men, though in May a 200-man team
virtually took over a provincial town.
The Burmese Communist Party de-
clared late last year that “the ideology
and program of so-called neutrality is,
in practice, serving modern revisionism
and hence we must struggle against it
under all circumstances.” But this
attack on the policy of the Burmese
Government has only now been given
strong support by Peking.
One Radio Peking broadcast last
week said the Chinese people vowed
with an “iron will” to “support the
Burmese people’s revolutionary
struggle.” The stage would appear to
be set for Chinese support of another
war of “national liberation.”
A considerable number of Burmese
Communists have been trained in
China and can be sent across the
border from Yunnan province together
with a flow of armaments. And the
Communists can fairly safely bank on
Western non - intervention. The
Burmese Government could hardly be
more inhibited against asking for
Western assistance. Article Three of
its Treaty with China prohibits it from
any military arrangements with other
nations, and the whole orientation of
its foreign policies has been against
security alliances. And there would
hardly be much popular enthusiasm in
the West for supporting a regime of Ne
Win’s variety.


South Vietnam
A pre-post defeat
THE THREAT of a disastrous split
in the South Vietnamese armed forces
lay behind last week’s announcement
that the country’s two top military
leaders would not compete in the com-
ing presidential elections, but run on
a joint ticket. The crisis in the Army
has thus precipitated a complete shift
in the Vietnamese power balance, with
General Thieu, the Head of State,
coming out-on top. He will now run
for the presidency with Premier Ky
as his Vice-President.
This outcome was not foreseen by
the American mission in Saigon, and
it was strongly resisted by Marshal Ky
himself. The Premier, who in recent
months came almost to stand for South
Vietnam in foreign eyes, has now suf-
fered a fall. His subsequent face-saving
announcement that he had stood down
to protect the unity of armed forces,
and not because of pressure, really
fooled no one.
If the new military ticket wins,
Marshal Ky as Vice-President will be
about as unimportant as his American
counterpart. Vietnamese politicians
are already pointing out with malicious
glee that his responsibilities would
include chairing a national council for
education and culture, and supervising
the country’s primitive mountain tribes-
men.
General Thieu’s emergence on top
is in keeping with informed Vietnam-
ese interpretations of his ability. One
Vie t n a m e s e political connoisseur
remarked after Ky’s stand-down that
the Americans had “taken the shadow
for the substance” in plumping for
Marshal Ky.
The 40-year-old general, a Roman
Catholic convert from Central Viet-
nam, is as silent as Marshal Ky is
talkative. His triumph seems to have
depended on seeing that Marshal Ky’s
weak point was vulnerability to the
charge of disrupting military unity.
According to reliable reports, divi-
sional commanders had been reduced
to a state of dangerous confusion by
the sight of the two leaders in open,
even angry, political competition. At
least some of these men had arrived
in Saigon before the ruling junta
began its crisis talks which led to Ky’s
withdrawal. It is certain that General
Khanh, commander of the Saigon area,
cast a crucial vote for General Thieu.
He had previously been regarded as
Marshal Ky’s friend.
These facts, plus the reduction of
powers for the police chief, General
Loan possibly Marshal Ky’s most
active supporter and increasingly feared
by many Vietnamese add up
virtually to a coup without troops in
the cause of military unity.
American officials are undoubtedly
relieved that the political fight between
Marshal Ky and General Thieu is off,
particularly since its origin, like its
resolution, took them by surprise. But
there have been other very important
political developments which seem to
ensure that the remaining weeks before
the September election will be very
lively.
Most important is the emergence of
a presidential candidate whose slogan
is “Cease-fire” and whose emblem is a
bomb negated by a large cross. Au
Truong Thanh, the 42-year-old lawyer
and economic expert whose slogan this
is, thus becomes the only one of the
18 presidential candidates to fight on
the issue of whether the South Viet-
namese themselves want to go on
fighting.
This is political dynamite, and it
could well open up the whole presi-
dential election, the major issue of which
so far has been whether a civilian or a
soldier would win. Even without a plat-
form that threatens to break all the
taboos of South Vietnamese politics,
Thanh would be one of the most
prominent civilian candidates. He served
as an able Economics Minister under
Marshal Ky until last year, and is well
thought of by many southern bourgeois
and intellectuals.
Many more political manoeuvres,
including the regrouping of alliances
among the civilian candidates, must be
expected in the next few weeks. But it
already seems clear that the Americans
cannot regard the appearance of the
Thanh ticket with anything but mis-
giving.
Cambodia
Big Red brothers
IF PRINCE NORODOM SIHA-
NOUK sleeps less fitfully in Phnom
Penh these days, Russia can claim to
have administered the tranquilliser
capsuled in a declaration that Moscow
recognises the territorial integrity of
Cambodia.
In supplying this diplomatic medica-
ment for Sihanouk’s almost obsessive
determination to maintain his country’s
Sihanouk (right) with Peking diplomats
in Phnom Penh. .. guns from China
boundaries, particularly against historic
enemies, Thailand and Vietnam
Russia has at once earned Cambodia’s
goodwill, and served her own ends.
The basis for the prescription was
decided in Moscow talks between the
Foreign Minister, Mr. Gromyko, and
his Cambodian opposite number
Prince Norodom Phurissara. Close on
the Russian declaration of recognition
there followed a visit to Phnom Penh
by a representative of the political arm
of the Viet Cong the South Viet-
nam Liberation Front, who also spoke
out for Cambodia’s territorial rights.
Then it was North Korea’s turn to
make the same gesture of friendship.
Finally, North Vietnam followed suit
next day.
Apart from gaining new ground in
the East’s most strongly neutralist
State (where Australia represents the
U.S., diplomatic relations with Wash-
ington having been severed since 1965),
Russia has also wiped out the bad
feeling that followed from its brusque
cancellation of a planned visit to Mos-
cow by Prince Sihanouk in 1965.
Cambodia’s neutrality, retention of
the monarchist system, and his coun-
try’s boundaries have long been
Sihanouk’s preoccupation, and he has
looked for friends where he could find
them on his terms. The Vietnamese,
partly because of the undue favoritism
shown to them by the French colonial-
ists in apportioning Indo-China, have
in the past nibbled away at several of
Cambodia’s provinces.
To the west, Thailand has always
disputed her frontier with Cambodia.
Under the Japanese occupation she
annexed part of the country, which was
returned to Cambodia after French
military intervention. The territorial
threats from east and west have caused
the Cambodian Government an
anxiety which the uncertain attitudes
of the Great Powers only heightened.
Until the latest development, only
three countries had proclaimed their
respect for Cambodia’s frontiers
France, Singapore, and East Germany.
But all three were distant enough to
make their gesture, however welcome,
merely juridical.
The Khmers, who, except for 500,000
Chinese and Vietnamese, make up the
Cambodian populace, looked for
solidarity to their great friend in the
north, China, but Peking has been
tardy in granting boundary recognition,
so as not to offend her North Viet-
nam allies. Prince Sihanouk speaks of
China as his No. 1 friend, but the visit
of the Cambodian Foreign Minister to
Moscow strained the friendship. Peking
was displeased. Moscow had stolen a
march on her. .
Encouraged by the new line-up o
friends, Cambodian socialists were
talking last week of renewed . anti-
imperialist solidarity. But there is t e

danger of restored friendship with

The risks of this situation are

Singapore
The big play
AT EVERY OBSTACLE in the sur-
vival course through which Singapore’s
Lee Kuan Yew has led his “rugged
society,” the Prime Minister himself
has always been able to summon up an
extra spurt of drive or imagination
—where it was called for.
Even while he was in London trying
to cut down to manageable size the
most formidable obstacle of all
Britain’s military cutback program
Mr. Lee had his Government back
home working on his newest item of
survival equipment—the “New Look”
Singapore.
The basis of it is the building of a
Golden Mile complex of hotels, restau-
rants, luxury flats, shopping arcades,
an exhibition centre, sports facilities, an
ice rink, parks, boatels, and whatever
else will bring in capital and tourists.
The building time is reckoned as three
years; the cost SA27 million. And, of
course, private investors are more than
welcome to join the carnival. The in-
centives for them are to include tax
exemptions, waiving of development
costs, and other concessions.
The “New Look” deal also seeks to
establish Singapore as the financial and
commercial centre for international
business. Hong Kong has suffered a
setback through China’s belligerence.
Taiwan is inaccessible. It’s an ideal time
for Singapore to make its big play to
have all things for all businessmen
safe haven, good banks,' sound currency,
stable government, political detach-
ment, strategic location, good communi-
cations, and good living.
If Mr. Lee can make Singapore the
capital capitalist city of the East, any
inconsistencies with his socialism will
just have to be overlooked. Survival
comes first.

ARTS AND ENTERTAINMENT
No grounds for complaint
By J. C. KAYE
THE CHAIRMAN of the Elizabethan
Theatre Trust, Melbourne stockbroker
Sir lan Potter, has gone on record to
say that it is silly for anyone to see
rivalry between the Sydney Opera
House and the Victorian Art Centre,
now reaching completion of its main
stage in St. Kilda Road, Melbourne.
Most Victorians would agree. The
superiority of the Arts Centre project
over the Opera House project is now
so clear that argument is no longer
necessary. Melbourne is bringing it off.
Sydney isn’t. There you have it, no
rivalry at all.
The Centre, known as the National
Art Gallery and Cultural Centre until
Cabinet trimmed the name down last
November, should open its art gallery
section by mid-1968. The second,
northern, section, with a 415 ft. copper
spire rising above a complex of theatres
and auditoriums, will take about two
years more. The details of this section
have not been announced, but should
be known soon after the project’s archi-
tect, Mr. Roy Burman Grounds, of
Melbourne, returns from his current
overseas trip.
Work goes ahead steadily, with none
of the sordid financial wranglings of
Bennelong Point. The Government has
backed a loan of about $5 million and
has streamed funds into the scheme at
a steady yearly rate. The public has
contributed about $1,300,000, including
six major gifts, by individuals, com-
panies, and foundations, of $lOO,OOO
each. The first section alone, when com-
pleted, is expected to have cost $l4
million, but on this score no one seems
worried at all. Even a bill of $BOO,OOO
for air-conditioning plant has caused
no reproaches to Mr. Grounds or the
building committee,. Mr. Grounds’ fee is
six percent, but after meeting costs he
reaps no fortune.
There has been no Federal help, ex-
cept that a snorkel contributed by Mr.
Holt to a fund-raising auction for the
Centre raised $24. (Some golf clubs
from Sir Henry Bolte brought $44.)
If the Centre keeps to schedule now,
and achieves its promise, one might
safely predict an end to international
competitions for such undertakings.
Unlike the Opera House, which
staged a competition and went ahead
on a graphic idea, the Melbourne build-
ing committee held no contest, much
to the annoyance of architects in
general.
In 1959 it merely invited any archi-
tect who might be interested to submit
an application accompanied by a few
photographs of recent creations. With-
out apology it announced that Mr. Roy
Grounds, then 54, had won out over
a score or more others. At that stage no
one knew what the Centre might look
like, although there were known needs
it had to meet.
Mr. Grounds, pleased but by no
means awed to have been chosen,
promised at once a big, bold scheme
that would give Melbourne the first
big-city gallery and centre “designed
for the needs of the 20th century.”
By early 1961 he and the building
committee were able to release to the
Press the first sketches of what the
future was to bring. The overall plan,
with its spire, main building divided
into three courtyards, tumbling trout-
The Victorian Art Centre...no trouble with the roof
stream-like moat, underground car
park, and State banqueting hall at
ground-floor level, has not changed
significantly since. But the plan has
been kept flexible enough to admit ideas
into the details.
Another way in which the Mel-
bourne concept has differed from Syd-
ney’s is that, apart from the intended
copper, gold-tipped spire, it is concen-
trating on interior rather than ex-
terior effects. There are no counter-
parts of the concrete sails. The main
buildings are meant to be impressive
but unostentatious. The smoothed blue-
stone walls, largely windowless, even
have a fortress-like look.
The Centre is to be something to dis-
appear into for hours at a time, the
outside world forgot. It is to be the first
gallery in the world, we are told, where
everything in the place will be viewable,
on the walls or floors, in the court-
yards, or in an upstairs section where
filegd pictures and objets d’art can be
pulled out on racks or in drawers.
Another aspect of Melbourne’s suc-
cess that will probably strike those who
wonder in the future how it was ever
done has been the masterly handling
of public relations.
No effort has been spared to impress
on the Victorian taxpayers that the
Centre is to be for the so-called
“ordinary” man, a palace for everyone.
The way Toorak and other segments
of high and smart society have got into
the act has never destroyed this
Common Joe line. For instance, the six
donors of $lOO,OOO may name six sec-
tions of the Centre, but contributors
of amounts as low as $2 will have their
names inscribed on an immortal roll,
Even pensioners have been reassured
that when they visit the gallery there
will be places to rest, escalators to end
climbing, and even plenty of handrails,
Families will be welcomed. For chil-
dren there will be no special need for
hush, although they will be asked not


to fall into the water. The working
classes have been reassured that there
will be Art for them as much as for
others. (No mention has been made of
beer-cans.)
Preparations have already begun to
move the contents of the National
Gallery in Swanston Street to the new
gallery, beginning in December or early
next year. The lot is said to be worth
about $25 million, and much of it is at
present out of sight in cellars. The
transfer will be done by night, under
armed guard, over a period of about
three weeks.
Already visitors cannot find enough
superlatives to tell Melbourne how fine
the Centre is or will be. “Absolutely
extraordinary! Magnificent! Marvel-
lous!” said Mr. Waldo Rassmussen,
executive director of circulating ex-
hibitions for the international council
of the Museum of Modern Art, New
York, when he called recently.
“Quite so,” is already the Mel-
burnian response.
Lovely, big pots
By JOAN LEYSER
POTTERY has always had a small
public compared with painting or even
sculpture; it is difficult to achieve
recognition as a creative potter. Les
Blakebrough has, although his experi-
ence in the craft is less than 11 years.
Blakebrough, currently having an exhi-
bition at Sydney’s Macquarie Galleries,
is director of the Sturt craft work-
shops at Mittagong, N.S.W., and his
work is represented in most of the
State galleries.
Blakebrough came to Australia from
England in 1948 as a boy of 18. He
came as a crew member of a cargo
boat headed for north Queensland to
' pick up sugar; he left the boat there,
went into the bush, and became a
jackeroo. Gradually he worked his way
down to Sydney. He did some drawing
and painting then, but attempted no
serious study until after a visit to his
family, living in Singapore, in 1954.
When his family returned to England
he decided to come back to Australia.
In 1956 he went to the National Art
School at East Sydney. After a short,
frustrating period in which he realised
he was not cut out to be a painter, he
transferred to the pottery school. After
nine months Ivan McMeekin, who
had initiated the Pottery Workshop at
Sturt, offered him a job. For years
he worked with McMeekin, whom he
regards as his first teacher. When
McMeekin left to carry out work and
research at the University of Sydney,
Blakebrough was asked to become
manager of the Pottery Workshop at
Sturt.
But after some time at Sturt, Blake-
brough began to feel the need for out-
side stimulus, so in 1962 he and his
wife, Sue, who had been teaching pot-
tery at Frensham school, Mittagong,
went to Japan.
Blakebrough was accepted as a pupil
of Takeichi Kawai, whose work he
very much admired. Les and Sue
Blakebrough went to live at the potters’
centre at Onda, a small and remote
village on Kyushu, famous for its
pottery. The inhabitants of Onda are
descended from Korean potters. They
farm their land and make pots as their
forebears have done for hundreds of
years.
The only change in their way of
life, Blakebrough says, seems to be their
enthusiastic acceptance of television.
The people of Onda have very little
contact with the rest of Japan and still
less with the outside world, but, as a
potter, Blakebrough felt he had a great
deal in common with them.
He said there are big followings for
various schools of thought on pot-
making. Some of Japan’s accepted
leaders in creative potting are known
as “national cultural assets.” His own
teacher’s uncle, Kanjiro Kawai, is such
an “asset.” The Kawais are a famous
family in Kyoto and Blakebrough came
under the influence of both men.
During his year in Japan, Blake-
brough made a thorough investigation
of Japanese kilns; the kiln at Sturt was
by now far too small to pay its way.
The kiln he built, with the help of
Takeichi Kawai, who returned with him
to Australia for a time, is based on the
Japanese climbing kiln. This is formed
by a succession of chambers, each one
higher than the one before. The heat
produced in one helps to preheat the
next one and the kiln functions like a
chimney. It is a very primitive way
of making use of waste heat and a
very efficient one.
On his work Blakebrough says: “One
of the lovely things about it is its com-
plexity. There is the skill and talent
you need to throw pots, and the skill
in formulating glazes. And these things
are so very different from the activity
of Qoping with the kiln. Fire is a fan-
tastic element to work with because
Blakebrough ... thriving workshop
of its unpredictability. And the art
content? Well, it is not consciously con-
trolled. Sometimes you are swinging
and sometimes you are not.”
He divides his output into domestic
tableware and exhibition pieces. It
should not be a struggle, he says, to
throw 100 pots identical except for
subtle differences in glazing and firing.
The tableware, which helps to make
Sturt the thriving workshop it is, he
finds a relief and a contrast to exhi-
bition pieces. “Every man,” he says,
“knows how much he can create, and I,
for one, cannot create endlessly. The
tableware is not great art, but it is
good, sound craftsmanship.”
He feels there is “something rather
grand about lovely, big pots” and the
plasticity of clay caught and held he
finds fascinating. His big pieces are
bought by galleries, banks, and insur-
ance offices, and by private clients with
a taste for them. The Reserve Bank,
Melbourne, displays a fine example of
one, a lidded pot in a deep blue glaze,
the shape finishing the lid suggesting
a flower frozen in the process of
opening.
Music
Taken by force
By PAUL FROLICH
Gina Bachauer, pianist. Town Hall,
Sydney.
ON GINA BACHAUER’S previous
visit one was made aware of little be-
yond a very percussive and immensely
forceful pianism; now, these qualities
can be assessed in proper perspective
and balanced against quite different
ones.
The programming appeared a little
surprising: less than two months after
Abbey Simon’s recital, Miss Bachauer
also played Brahms’ F minor sonata,
opus 5. This work often seems endless
and Mr. Simon’s meticulous reading of
it was not exactly exhilarating. Miss
Bachauer, revelling in her power,
brought much-needed emphasis to the
dramatic outer movements and aston-
ished with the Schumannesque tender-
ness she discovered in the two Andantes.
Here was romantic pianism of a high
order.
The recital opened, in excellent taste,
with three of Bach’s Preludes and
Fugues from Book I of the Well-
tempered Clavier (Nos. 2,5, and 16).
Although one iftay disagree with the
principle of playing this music on a
modern concert piano, the manner of
Miss Bachauer’s presentation deserved
appreciation. The piano itself was in
much better shape than for the previous
week’s performance by Peter Frankl,
and we were treated to very fine
pianism, somewhat in the manner of
Busoni or Serkin, in the service of great
music.
The second half of the recital was


devoted to Chopin and Debussy. The
latter’s Preludes are often so very deli-
cate and atmospheric that they seemed
an odd choice for so “grand” a pianist;
indeed, her playing was rather too big
for several of the eight Preludes chosen
by her. But at least three of them
turned into delightful musical exper-
iences: “La Puerta del Vino” was richly
earthy, “La Serenade interrompue” had
just the right degree of wistfulness, and
the “Feux d’Artifice,” in the manner
of most fireworks displays, emphasised
bangers rather than Catherine wheels.
To my ear, the best music of the
evening came in Chopin’s Barcarolle
and the delicious Ecossaises. The
Barcarolle, not so often heard nowa-
days, was played with a complete
abandon to its romantic sensuousness
and although some of the pianist’s
scanning in the Ecossaises might be
arguable, the music sounded quite en-
chanting.
Theatre
Running Wilde
By PHILLIP ADAMS
Importance of Being Earnest. Oscar
Wilde. St. Martin’s, Melbourne.
EMIGRE DESIGNER Kenneth Rowell
has reacted to Wilde with the creative
lust of a placard painter on May Day
or Gulley Jimson approaching his
ultimate wall. With the smell of green
carnations wafting around him and the
inspiration of Audrey Beardsley’s fun-
goid vision, Rowell has created a most
ominous setting for Irene Mitchell’s
production of “Earnest.” The walls and
stairways are a mass of sculptured
toadstool and opalescent mould,
strangely reminiscent of Luna Park’s
River Caves, and this same organic
material flows over tables and chairs
as if searching for edible actors.
The production isn’t as adventurous
as Rowell’s environment, but it is
scholarly and stylish. The two would-
be Earnests are played by two Pauls—
in cleverly contrasted vocal styles.
While Paul Karo, as Moncrieff, gives
a languid slur to his words, Paul Eddy’s
Worthing speaks in a high-pitched
adenoidal monotone. The voices refuse
to mix, which gives additional life to
Wilde’s dazzling double-talk. As the
Rev. Chasuble, Keith McCartney gives
the impression of having embraced celi-
bacy with great relief.
Joan McArthur is an eloquent Lady
Bracknell, but needed some more wat-
tage in her delivery to be sufficiently
imperious. She could borrow some
volume from Pauline Charleston’s
overly dominant Gwendoline. The best
female performance comes from Fay
Kelton, who plays Cecily Cardew as a
carnivorous kewpie-doll.
After the original first night H. G.
Wells found the play’s delightful revival
of theatrical satire with a humor that
was Gilbertian “with innumerable
spangles of its own.” Other critics
were even more impressed. The only
sour note came from Bernard Shaw,
who found the whole thing mindless
and a waste of his precious time.
But Wilde’s own comments still seem
the most acute. “It is exquisitely trivial,
a delicate bubble of fancy, and it has
a philosophy. That we should treat all
the trivial things of life seriously, and
the serious things with studied trivi-
ality.” Those words explain the dura-
bility of the play’s charm and,
incidentally, would be hard to beat as
a definition of “camp.”
Annual encounter
By MADELEINE ARMSTRONG
The Merchant of Venice. William
Shakespeare. Genesian. Sydney.
The Typists. Murray Schisgal. “Q”
Lunch-Hour Theatre.
THE GENESIAN THEATRE is the
only theatre in Sydney which presents
a season of Shakespeare every year, no
small achievement for an amateur com-
pany. The standard varies considerably
from production to production. I still
remember the 1964 “Richard III” with
pleasure. But this “Merchant of
Venice” has, with a few exceptions, very
inexperienced players, and the less said
about the verse-speaking the better.
Nevertheless, I found it an interest-
ing production and it appealed to the
schoolchildren in the audience. There
is a great deal of business, some of it
imaginative, some rather knockabout.
Since the children are very familiar
with the play they were in a position
to appreciate the business and they
like the knockabout.
The interesting thing is that Ray-
mond Ainsworth’s production does not
strive to present the play in a way that
will least offend the modern liberal
temper. For example Antonio actually
spits at Shylock when they first meet
and Shylock later wipes his cheek.
Terrence Madden’s Shylock, in spite
of his tangled black locks, sinister make-
up, and harsh green and white striped
costume is not a stage Jew, but neither
is he the near-tragic figure that we are
used to in modern productions.
For the most part the inexperience
of the actors prevents them from gloss-
ing over the elements which seem un-
comfortable to modern taste: the moral
self-righteousness of the Christian
gentlemen toward the Jews, culminat-
ing in the sentencing of Shylock to for-
sake his religion as well as his worldly
goods, or the unashamed fortune-
hunting of the extravagant Bassanio
This young man certainly does not seeni
to deserve the witty and resourceful
Portia, played with plenty of character
by Ina Drum. Perhaps the gentlest and
most amiable character in the play i s
Lancelot Gobbo, amusingly played bv
John Curley.
“The Typists” seems much more like
a play of the struggling ’thirties than
the affluent ’sixties. The fact that one
of the two typists is a man immediately
places it in the dim past. Jobs are
hard to get and easy to lose, and the
boss, sitting unseen in the inner office
is a frightening and unpredictable
presence. For the man who married
too young and carries a whisky bottle
in his overcoat pocket, for the spinster
who lives with her mother, the best
that can be hoped is to grow old in
the office, faithful to their typewriters
as bosses come and go.
That was how it seemed in the
’thirties, but it did not turn out like
that. There was the war and every-
thing changed. Nowadays, I should
think, people are more likely to be
afraid of being ousted by a computer
than of being chained to their type-
writers for thirty years. As a vision of
the future it seems to belong to the
past.
Having wondered at first if “The
Typists” was supposed to be a send-up
of the avant-garde , I decided that it
was ’thirties realism with a few avant-
garde trimmings. But it is amusing and
well acted by Lynne Murphy and
Kevin Miles, directed by Maurice Hil-
liard.
Television
Dead-end
By FRANK ROBERTS
STRIKE US LUCKY! When, if ever,
are we going to grow up enough to
react sensibly to the slightest sign of
overt “sex”—sensibly enough to think
before reaching for the telephone to
complain, or the scissors to censor?
I refer to the ridiculous nationwide fuss
over a seven-second scene in the first
episode of “You Can’t See Round
Corners,” adapted for television by
Richard (“Autumn Affair”) Lane from
Jon Cleary’s early-1940s book. Frankie
McCoy (Ken Shorter) walks into the
local park with his girl (Rowena
Wallace) the night before he answers
his call-up. In a clinch he makes a
clumsy grope at the front of her dress
and an even clumsier one at her bottom.
Naturally, she leaps to hnr feet and
rejects the pass. That’s all. CTC7 in
Canberra gave its viewers a blank
screen for those seven seconds. TVvV/
in Perth left it in and received many
phone calls, 50 percent complimentary.
Presumably it would have gone more


or less that way among the 30 or so
channels screening the show in Aus-
tralia, some blanking the scene, some
leaving it in and getting varied re-
actions from viewers. The Control
Board had merely advised the channels
to “look carefully before screening.”
The Sydney “Sun,” closely associated
•with the makers, ATN7, gave rave
notices to the show and the scene,
“raw drama,” etc. Personally, I could
recall a faint surprise during a simi-
larly raw moment at the beginning of
Elmer Rice’s “Street Scene,” on stage,
30 or more years ago. I welcomed
the “Corners” scene because it made
someone near me say, “Gee!” just as
I was about to fall asleep.
“You Can’t See” was living up to
the expectations I mentioned last year
when the Board made some new stipu-
lations on Australian prime-time drama.
I could see around that corner enough
to know we would be viewing some
poor productions, tamely scripted,
directed at a pace approaching slow
motion, possibly with younger and
better actors, possibly technically better
than earlier attempts.
Even there I was wrong, as far as
the technical work in “Y.C.S.R.C.”
goes. The first episode had two punch-
ups too unreal for words and McCoy
walking a Newtown street (they
changed the locale from the original
Paddington because that suburb is too
prettied-up these days) with grinding
total sound effects, people grinning at
the camera, and so on. To overcome
this, they appeared to have made the
second episode (of Army training) at
midnight, outdoors. Well, at least the
main actors are young, and better.
In this context we should look at
the “raw scene” two ways. As far as
morals of the young are concerned, the
girl did reject the pass, which might
convince someone young that this is
good acceptable behaviour, which is a
pos'tive contribution. The other view-
point is that “Y.C.S.R.C.” needs such
a scene each week, with “Sun” cries
to alert people to it, to continue to
hold any viewer interest at all, per se,
or as a sample of Australian produc-
tion, which viewers hold in suspicion
already.
Art
Electronic tree
By ELWYN LYNN
Asher Bilu. Tolarno Galleries, Mel-
bourne.
Judy Cassab. Rudy Komon Galleries,
Sydney.
ART DESTROYS its own terms;
movement,” which stays still yet fluctu-
ates, slides, melts, or cuts a crisp course
m Judy Cassab’s abstracts, actually
moves in the new kinetics. As no kinetic
piece can involve total movement there
must be some still areas capable of
movement in the traditional aesthetic
sense, and it is the achievement of
sculptors like Tinguely, Takis, Uecker,
Le Parc, and Pol Bury that their kin-
etic works balance so excitingly the two
kinds of movement.
It happens, too, with Sculptron I,
now glowing, flickering, wailing, or
singing like a musique concrete soprano
in a room by itself at the Tolarno.
Asher Bilu, hitherto noted for mystical
texturologies, and Tim Berriman, an
electronics engineer, have nurtured a
tree of life, blossoming like a huge
chromium-plated and scarlet fuchsia
tree. Like the Aeolian harp it responds
to vocal zephyrs; when its own sounds
rise to a throbbing growl and the lights
darken, the eight huge blossoms become
those of an incandescent and carniv-
orous jungle plant. It is a curious blend
of the ro,mantic and scientific, but it
was Mary Shelley who created Franken-
stein who created his monster, and what
used to look so exact in the sciences
seems now mystifyingly inexact.
To be, precise;. Sculptron I, about
nine feet high and costing $5OOO, has
eight “lamps” on adjustable, flexible
tubes; the deep lampshades of crim-
son perspex are painted with trans-
parent silver on the inside, and the
“globes” are green television cathode-
ray tubes, each with a different moving
pattern of writhing, flickering, circling,
or skipping lines, which may be sharp-
ened or melted from a control box
on the trunk. The patterns change
shape and direction in reaction to your
noises or to weirder noises taped into
the machine.
The stems of the blooms grow from
a polished sphere where you are
reflected but distorted, as is everything
in the presence of this precise, intricate,
and marvellously irrational machine.
Goethe thought works of art like kings;
you waited until they spoke to you.
But this democratic contrivance joins
all in unsolicited dialogue and ironic-
ally meets the demand that a work of
art should not remain inert before the
viewer. Compared with Sculptron,
Kitching’s flushed daydreams for un-
involved contemplation are pleasantries;
Sculptron engages the imagination at
a number of levels and demands a
readjustment on what a work of art is.
Asher Bilu has some 30 ink-stain
works on silver foil that shines through
the inks and slightly records the
presence of the viewer as it reflects his
brightness or dullness. This is not the
only link with Sculptron because these
works have their own eeriness as the
fluid images fleetingly suggest palms,
embryos, skeletons of autumn leaves,
tracks of a light-footed monster, and
those ambiguous faces by Dali and
Archimboldo. Some recall the sur-
realistic use that Ernst made of Vic-
toriana, and the rich dc,corativeness can
be, except in some very pale works,
cloyingly claustrophobic, but in a chal-
lenging rather than soporific way.
In her best abstract show to date
Judy Cassab moves among crisply
severe forms, mitigated by mottled and
marbled fugitive areas, with a new
authoritative grace. Her formal inven-
tiveness is daring and her decorative
touch so engaging that one tends to
overlook the power and pressure of the
forms. The mottled shapes with diaph-
anous areas float on the surface and
restrain the assertiveness of the unin-
flected shapes; though the forms are
delicately placed, she is not concerned
alone with meticulous and well-bred
disposition of spaces; in a simple work
like Prologue the red rectangle on a
beautifully mottled pink-grey begins to
slide south and calls on the rest of the
shapes to rescue it. In Dispersion,
shapes disintegrate above a slab of
orange that should look inert, but
anxiously tries to hold the forms to-
gether. Some areas have the sudden,
abrupt look of collage, and in Blue
Horizon a marbled oblong is glued over
some sombre shapes to infuse them
with energy.
There is, indeed, a subdued, restrained
energy in all these works; it seems to
blush at being discovered at all in
Room Remembered; it floats in tidal
stains in Red and Green; asserts itself
with elan in Dyptich; and in Echoes 2
Soulptron I, priced at $5000
seems about to fade in the hazy blues,
greys, and fawns of a quite masterly
work, but suddenly reaffirms itself in
a crisp circle in a square on the right
edge.
Some have a faded, autumnal
lyricism and some, like Encounter, with
its two mottled pillars, a tough presence,
but all are searchingly concerned with
the life and decoration of forms; it is
ecole-de-Paris, with some of the energy
of color-field abstraction, something of
European expressionism, but mainly it’s
about the excitement of making flat
planes stir significantly in a shallow
surface and controlling movement with
sweetly sour, undecided, and ravishing
color. What Sculptron dons scientific-
ally, Judy Cassab does intuitively, and
both move most intriguingly.


BUSINESS AND FINANCE
Broad accuracy in Estimates:
what about the details?
THE FINANCIAL YEAR having
ended and statistics about it begin-
ning to flow, there was some amuse-
ment in the Treasury at the financial
results for the Commonwealth. Aggre-
gate spending and revenue estimates
had been remarkably close to those set
in the Budget, closer than for many
years —“a variation of only about one-
tenth of one percent” as the Treasurer
said triumphantly in a Press statement. 1
But the accuracy in the aggregate
concealed very large variations in the
detail. The Defence departments as
usual did not spend the money allo-
cated to them; neither did the uni-
versities or Qantas. This underspending
was offset by a very healthy increase
in general departmental expenses above
those allowed for.
On the revenue side a similar situa-
tion prevailed. Customs, excise, and
sales-tax collections were well below
their budgeted level—an indication, in-
cidentally, that the backroom boys in
Treasury had expected consumer spend-
ing to be more than it was. On the
other hand, business profitability was
greater than the Treasury had fore-
seen and $6O million more taxes were
reaped in this area than budgeted.
Individual wage-earner income tax col-
lections were spot on.
Export incentives
Treasury sermons
IN THE EARLY DAYS of the Pater-
son butter plan it used to make
Gippsland housewives mad having to
pay two bob a pound for the butter
their husbands’ co-ops made when tons
of it were being sold at half the price
to African natives to rub on their skins.
The explanations of the economists of
the day were not much comfort. Few
of the ladies understood, or wanted to
understand, that the Paterson plan’s
object was to get more jam for the
nation’s bread by way of extra export
income, what with wool selling at 7d
a lb. and all that.
Nobody is going to believe for a
moment that in July, 1967, H.M. Fed-
eral Treasury, like, say, Mrs. Jones, is
unaware of the Paterson point. Most will
prefer to think that the holier-than-
thou view on export subsidies and in-
centives expressed in its essay on re-
sources allocation in the latest White
Paper on the economy is just another
thrust in the economic duel between
Treasury and Trade. Perhaps it is as
well to spell out the relevant passages
in the survey so readers can enjoy the
point:
“Bounties or subsidies may directly
or indirectly encourage production for
export. Assistance of this sort to
exporters could contravene the General
Agreement on Tariffs and Trade and
in any event run the risk of retaliation
Sir Richard Randall: Treasury purists
by competing exporters or by import-
ing countries with domestic producers
to protect.
“Whether particular export incen-
tives are technically subsidies or not,
the fact remains that, if they permit
exports to be sold for less than their
cost in resources actually used to pro-
duce and transport them, they are
being sold at a net loss to the national
resources. The exporter may cover his
costs, but the nation that has met the
cost the incentive may not.”
Even if exports of things other than
dairy products are doing well enough
for the Treasury to take a good look
at the economic costs of some of the
more notorious forms of export sub-
sidies, it has overstated the case for
cutting them down in the interests of
getting a better deployment of our
economic resources. The Treasury’s
argument seems to rest on the debatable
proposition that we are giving some-
thing away to foreigners and fails to
acknowledge the beneficial offsets to the
balance of payments. It also falls down
by lumping “incentives” (by which it
presumably means tax concessions) with
direct forms of subsidy. How else do
you get exports of Australian manu-
factures established and expanded in
overseas markets (especially new ones)
unless you give incentives to our local
industrialists to avert their gaze from
the soft option of the home market.
In some shape or form practically
every country exporting manufactures
does it and its guises are endless, from
long-term credit techniques to tax
concession. GATT, BAH!

Lessons for wool
WHEN THE N.Z. Wool Commission
bowed to market forces last week and
cut its reserve price from 36d to 30d
a pound, it was shutting the door after
the horse had gone. It had pretty
nearly exhausted its funds by buying, at
artificially high prices, the bulk of
lower-quality wool offered by growers
over the season. It faced the problem of
financing not only the heavy cost of
carrying some 650,000 bales of wool
indefinitely, but also of continuing its
buying, albeit at the lower reserve
price. There was nothing for it but
to call on a hardly pressed Govern-
ment to help foot the bill. The lessons
for Australian reserve price protagon-
ists are written large.
The sorest point for the N.Z. Gov-
ernment was not that it has had to
bow to the Commission’s request for
financial support when every penny
counts in its determined effort to cut
back its own and general spending in
the economy. It was that by buying in
all that wool (amounting to about a.
third of the season’s clip) the Commis-
sion has robbed the country of its
counterpart in unrealised export in-
come.
The woolgrowers have so far been
insulated from all this. They got better
returns for their wool from the Com-
mission than they would had there been
no reserve price. The sting for them
will come later. With the Commissions
stockpile overhanging the market and
its support funds strictly limited (even
in relation to the new reserve price))
the woolgrowers can only look ahead
to substantially smaller cheques.
There’s one saving grace not for
the woolgrowers but for the economy.
From now on the latter should be
relieved of some inflationary pressure
as the Commission pumps out less
money to the woolgrowers.


THE WEEK BRIEFLY
For the economy 2 The Federal Government finished
the 1966-67 year with a cash deficit of $138m., somewhat in
contrast with the s27om. deficit budgeted for. On overall
expenditure and receipts the Treasury Is congratulating itself
on its accuracy, adding that the economy’s expansion had
been “almost precisely” as hoped.
Australia’s overseas trade for 1966-67 showed a $6.4m.
deficit on current account, against the previous year’s s2lBm.
deficit; the last month, June, produced a slm. deficit.
The Reserve Bank’s gold and foreign exchange dropped
$154.7m. in 1966-67, to reach $1133.7m. at June 30.
The trading bank’s new and increased lending commit-
ments eased back in June, averaging $31.1m. a week; May’s
figure had been $35.9m. Overdraft limits rose s47m. (May,
$67m.) to $4495.3m.
For the markets : The investment indexes began to
tell the story of Australian share markets as broader im-
provement among industrialists gathered pace. Miners are
subject to more careful reflection.
London finished close to the week’s opening levels, with
greater caution among buyers ... A reasonable advance on
Wall Street allowed most prices to overcome the usual
profit-taking.
For companies: BHP captured its usual Friday (and
the rest of the week) with a record $42,171,000 profit a
17 percent advance on 1965-66 and giving a 16.4 percent
earning rate (previously 15.4 percent). This came after both
higher tax and depreciation. A most notable “cash flow”
totalled $93.2m., against 1965-66’s $80.4m. Parent profit went
from $23,765,000 to $26,665,000.
After that, it’s hard to know where to begin, but at
least Melbourne flour miller Robert Hutchinson upheld
tradition by being first of the June 30 results; its earnings
rose 10 percent to $224,500 and directors talked about
“maximum trading” . . . Grocer and produce merchant
Permewan Wright is to pay its tenth successive 12£
percent dividend.
The motor trade enthused with GM-H dealer John A.
Gilbert, whose earnings moved from $209,213 to $225,351
following a bad couple of years and a cheerful last quarter
. . . Another GM-H distributor, Sydney Holdings, put profit
up 8 percent to $184,918, with “most encouraging” prospects
ahead . . . The black side appeared with Melbourne’s
Southern Motors, which lost $23,538 and had to miss the
final dividend . . . Adelaide Motors’ coming profit will not
cover a steady 14 percent dividend.
Distinctly better investment income helped push Bankers
and Traders’ Insurance earnings up from $328,171 to
$418,640 and earning rate from 24.3 to 29.9 percent . . .
New Zealand Insurance has brought dividend from 11 2-3
to 12 percent by a final 7 percent.
Paper merchant Edwards Dunlop (plus the B. J. Ball
takeover) showed profit $230,473 higher at $774,593 21
percent better than the previous separate profits.
Pioneer Industries, under takeover seige from the U.S.
H. K. Porter, thinks 1966-67 earnings will reach $126,077
$24,077 more than an earlier estimate; the dividend thus
moves from 5 to 8 percent . . . The large buyer of Strata
shares turned out to be Mainline Holdings, whose managing
director goes to Strata’s board.
Gold and copper output from Mount Morgan were much
better in the latest year . . . Mount Isa went 31.5 percent
down on copper and improved on lead and zinc . . .
Magellan Petroleum proposes to drill in Bass Strait.
MEN AND MATTERS
ONE RESULT of the complicated
troika being performed by British
Tobacco, Fibre Containers, and Dodge
Consolidated in the latest bit of merg-
ing in the packaging industry is that
the Dodge name will leave the share
lists after a brief (seven years), but very
profitable spell (its original 5/- shares
have appreciated by six times, and a
total of 100 percent has been paid in
dividends).
Dodge was founded by Kurt Dodge,
a Viennese law graduate working in a
bank, who, like so many Jews, left
Austria in 1938 aged 29 to come to
Australia, where he started an accoun-
tancy course. After spending the war
in the Army, he wondered what to do
with himself. For no particular reason
(apart from the fact that his C.O.
lent him some money to start a busi-
n ess), he decided to make novelties,
like paper blow-outs and cardboard
boxes. Then in 1947 the business be-
came a proprietary company with
Jacques Spira and Fred Lustig, two
friends, also taking a stake in it. The
cardboard box part of the business
boomed, set off largely by contracts to
supply the chain stores
One of most striking features of
the first four years of Dodge on the
lists (before it came under the sway
of British Tobacco in a partial take-
over three years ago) was the way
Kurt Dodge mastered the art of the
takeover; his eight takeovers in four
years all “paid off” in bringing higher
earnings to the group, unlike so many
takeover experts of the time, whose
companies suffered indigestion from ex-
panding too fast this way. Dodge would
only make an acquisition if it would
increase his earning rate on funds em-
ployed. And he always retained the
management. So it is appropriate that
he will remain at the head of Dodge
now it is to become a subsidiary of
Fibre Containers (when it becomes a
subsidiary of Leigh Mardon, which is
a subsidiary of British Tobacco).
A. K. (Kevin) Smith, the 49-year-
old managing director of Fibre Con-
tainers, also trained as an accountant
and has also used the takeover weapon
i n building his company up to its
present impressive size before succumb-
ing to an offer himself. Smith got into
fibre packaging after a spell in Canada
(following war-time RAAF training)
convinced him that his family s timbei
and box-making company would have
to move into the fibre end of the
business. So in 1946 Smith Bros. Pty.
Ltd., of which he was general manager,
joined with other boxmakers and APM
in forming Fibre Containers and in
1959 Kewn Smith moved into the GM
seat at Fibres.
When APM retired from Fibres in
1954, this left the Smith family as
major shareholders in Fibres (they still
Kurt Dodge
Kevin Smith
are). Kevin’s father, A.C., is chairman.
Kevin Smith, who stresses the im-
portance of good personal relations in
business, built up quite a reputation as
the “youngest president” of a number
of trade organisations, like the Timber
Development Association and the Box
and Case Association apart from
being the general manager of his
family company at only 27. His back-
ground in the highly competitive
timber industry stood him in good
stead in the past couple of years
when the packaging industry has been
a hard battleground. But now things
are much improved in packaging
largely due to the sort of rationalising
move that is now bringing Kevin Smith
and his company into the British
Tobacco orbit.


THE
CROESUS
TOUCH
There's not enough
Government
help for oil
BY J. C. HORSFALL
GRAPPLING WITH a tight budgetary-
situation, the Federal Government
would surprise everybody next month
if at long last it did something more
concrete to advance a national fuel
policy by new fiscal measures. It is
still sitting pat on minimal oil search
subsidies (with too many strings
attached), coupled with high protection
for our still meagre domestic crude oil
production (now about six percent of
local consumption), as its policy. In
other words, the Government is still
hoping for the best that these two
forms of inducement will be sufficient
for oil search companies, mostly over-
seas owned or controlled, to do the job
of scaling down Australia’s heavy depen-
dence on imported crude oil to keep
the nation’s wheels turning.
The Government has always turned
a deaf ear to suggestions that the
Bureau of Mineral Resources should
enter the search effort direct. It has
been equally adamant against imposing
a special tax on motor spirit, the pro-
ceeds to be applied in the form of
more liberal oil search subsidies. (In
their present form these put a premium
on wild-catting and are on the stingiest
scale imaginable considering the impor-
tance in national priorities of finding
more local oilfields.)
Generally speaking, the Government
has eschewed the role of leading the
public toward a national fuel policy
in which national interests would have
priority over private ones. Perhaps the
Australian public is more concerned
with getting its supplies of petroleum
products as cheaply as possible, and in
unrestricted quantities, than it is with
where the raw materials come from.
But although cheapness and availability
are important also in the eyes of the
Government, it has a responsibility also
to see that such considerations as de-
fence and the balance of payments are
served in prosecuting these narrower
objectives.
It is true, of course, that the Loan
Council recently guaranteed funds to
South Australia and Victoria for financ-
ing the building of gas pipelines. The
cheaper gas that such pipelines will
ultimately afford consumers of this
product will admittedly cut into the
demand for some products refined from
imported crude oil. On the other hand,
the level of crude oil imports is not
determined by the demand for those
particular products (mainly furnace oil)
but rather by that for motor spirit.
Even if, in line with a recent oil
industry forecast, the rate of growth in
Australia’s demand for motor spirit is
going to slow down over the next ten
years, the quantity of imported crude
needed will rise; that is, unless very
much more substantial local production
of crude than at present seems likely
comes to light. Crude imports of 125
million barrels cost $250 million (in-
cluding freight) in 1965-66 and the
quantity imported was about 7 percent
higher in the year just ended despite
bringing in new local sources.
Moonie, Alton, and Barrow Island,
the three Australian oilfields now pro-
ducing commercially, have obviously
not succeeded in arresting the upward
trend in crude oil imports. All they’ve
done is to temper its pace a little.
Their contribution is most useful, but
going on estimated future production
and reserves of these three fields they
are unlikely to provide more than a
Barrow Island...a cupful or two
cupful or two for the bulging bale of
future crude oil requirements.
Against this, the offshore field dis-
covered by Esso-BHP in Bass Strait
holds out much more promise of pro-
ducing quantities sufficient to bring the
share of local crude to a significant
part of total requirements, possibly as
much as 15 to 20 percent within five
years; that is probably enough to look
after the projected annual increase of
5 to 6 percent in total crude require-
ments. If this contribution was supple-
mented by worthwhile quantities from
Woodside (Lakes Entrance) and Associ-
ated Australian Oilfields, which have
had substantial flows at single wells off
the Gippsland coast and Duarran in
Queensland respectively, the situation
would be so much better. However,
these two finds are more in the bush
than in the hand at the moment. We
can’t exactly count on them as balance
of payments relievers at this stage.
Nor can we count on the possibility
of other searchers, either offshore or on
the mainland, unearthing something i n
the near future to improve the pros-
pect. On land the search effort is to
say the best of it, currently desultory
and one has to look out to sea to bolster
up one’s confidence for future signifi-
cant finds. These could come from, say
WAPET in the northern waters and
islands off W.A. or from Shell in the
western waters of Victoria, where it
spudded in a new well off Lome last
week. Both these groups appear to be
operating in promising waters, yet ugly
problems of finance could be in the
making to affect the scale of operations
in both areas in the event of all three
costly wells being drilled by Shell off
the Victorian coast proving abortive
the first one has already been
abandoned.
It has already cost Shell $4 million,
with only one well of the three yet
drilled to earn its 50 percent share in
Frome Broken Hill, which holds the
leases in the area. Although the other
three partners will now have to meet
50 percent of the costs between them
for the remaining planned wells, it has
to be remembered that Shell is also
putting up two-sevenths (Caltex and
Ampol the rest) of WAPET’s search
and other development (very consider-
able at Barrow Island) outlays and is
spending money in a Queensland
tenement as well.
Shell’s total involvement in oil search
this year will be about $lO million. If
it draws all blanks in the Otway Basin,
off the Victorian coast, it would surely
have to reconsider its general position
in oil search here. This could .have
repercussions on WAPET’s search pro-
' gram, though happily Barrow Island oil
is now rattling that group’s tills to some
extent.
Oil search activity is well below what
it should be. Even a high officer of the
Bureau of Mineral Resources recently
admitted that and described the present
phase as a “pause,” and the overall
effort “too diffuse.” For all that, the
oil search industry itself is very con-
fident. One of the leading speakers at
this year’s conference of the Australian
Petroleum Exploration Association, its
vice-president, Mr. C. W. Siller, was
supremely so. He said, “I very strongly
believe that at least two new oilfields
will be discovered within the next. 12
months, and this will, in my opinion,
place beyond doubt that Australia is
well on the way to its target of self-
sufficiency in both oil and natural
gas resources.” Soon after the con-
ference both Woodside and the Associ-
ated Group struck oil, not that one well
makes an oilfield by a long shot.
All in all it would seem premature
to be saying we are well on the way to
self-sufficiency. As other speakers
warned, to reach that goal the Govern-
ment must play a stronger role and take
less of the fruits of success in royalties,
much more capital must be attracted
and applied to the search task and the
enthusiasm of those in it must be main-
tained and encouraged.


Isaac on wages and productivity
FLYING A KITE
FOR AN INCOMES POLICY
THE PRESENCE OF Sir Richard
Kirby and a representative selection of
trade union and industry leaders at
the Reserve Bank in Melbourne a
couple of weeks ago to launch Profes-
sor J. E. Isaac’s new book, “Wages
and Productivity,” published by
Cheshire under CEDA auspices,
promised well for wide public discus-
sion of its controversial contents. Con-
troversial is the word. Apparently it has
even aroused some hard feelings within
CEDA itself, a body which seems to
have awakened to good purpose over
the past year or so what with its
publication of this book and a few
months ago of one by Professor
Matthews on “Public Investment in
Australia.” Two members have
already opened fire on the book and
more assaults seem likely to be made
at a seminar CEDA is holding on the
book on July 26.
The most hostile of the CEDA
trustees so far seems to be Mr. H. G.
Foletta, governing director of Prestige
Ltd. In his view, although the work
is perhaps a very good argument from
the outlook of Professor Isaac, it
is not one which should have been
published under CEDA auspices. His
reason is that its whole construction is
directed toward flying a kite for an
incomes policy. He considers, prob-
ably rightly, that this would be a
major step toward a more tightly
controlled economy. For its part, the
Australian Woolgrowers’ Council,
another contributor to CEDA, dis-
sents on different grounds. It con-
siders the treatment doesn’t give suf-
ficient consideration to the position of
unsheltered industry, a well-worn theme
of the council sometimes lost sight
of by the Country Party of more mod-
ern times.
CEDA has done well to publish the
book, because, quite apart from being
highly controversial both in its main
and some of its secondary themes, it
js a first-class diagnosis of the possi-
bilities open to us to get wage fixing
m Australia on a more sensible basis;
{ hat is, one (put broadly) where
wages. do not run ahead of pro-
ductivity increases to the disturbance
°f price and balance of payments
equilibria. As well as doing this job
better than it has ever been done
before, Professor Isaac also explains in
broad intelligible outline most of
the important things that have been
happening in the wage-fixing area over
the years, recent events in particular,
hor the general public the book will
make a whole lot clearer what the
total wage and the minimum wage (as
distinct from the now extinct basic
wage) are all about and why some
of the old wage concepts have been
discarded by the Commission.
In working these areas, Isaac
unravels the skein of facts about the
labor market in Australia, finding the
existence and scale of over-award pay-
ments as the most intractable from
the Commission’s viewpoint and thus
as the most pertinent to his recom-
mendation of the adoption of an
incomes policy. It cannot be doubted,
as he says, that “the size of these
over-award payments is important, that
it has continued to grow, that award
Prof. J. E. Isaac
increases are not
absorbed by over-
award pay, and
that the pace of
increase continues
to produce a ten-
dency for prices
to rise, at times
with dangers for
ihe balance of
payments.” If, as
Isaac argues, an
incomes policy is the logical way of
accommodating all these facts in wage
fixing, he also recognises that the path
toward its implementation is strewn with
thorns. At least these things should be
talked about. The issues should not be
shirked.
The Commission comes out of the
book well. Looking back on the past
fifteen years, Isaac sees “some definite
improvement” in its understanding and
approach to its role under conditions of
full employment. “It appreciates the
part productivity plays in wage
increases; it is aware of the widespread
effect of its decisions on wage costs
and prices, and through prices on the
balance of payments; it is more clearly
than ever alive to the fact that
although its statutory task is to prevent
and settle industrial disputes, in
relation to national wage cases, it is,
in fact, bound to take a wider view
than a ‘black letter’ interpretation of
its statutory provisions might suggest.”
Above all, it has become expert in
the art of compromise, a discounter
of “theories and policies,” and accepts
the relevance of economic and social
as well as industrial considerations in
its deliberations.
Sir Richard Kirby, for one, should
be pleased with that and also with
Isaac’s exposition of recent decisions,
because he told The Bulletin at the
launching that, although the Press was
improving in its interpretations and
appreciation of the Commission’s
activities, it hadn’t done all that good
a job in getting the notions of the total
and minimum wage across to the
public. He also indicated he had an
open mind about some of the ideas
put up by the Press recently, including
one Croesus has been canvassing (and
Isaac supports) that the Commission
should have economists on it. One of
his doubts on the latter was whether
professional economists would want to
become full-time commissioners (the
economics professor listening to the
dialogue wasn’t saying!). As it is, Sir
Richard said he was “always talking
with economists,” and we probably
underestimate the extent to which
their views were taken into considera-
tion by the Commissioners.
As well as wanting economists to
assist more, either formally or other-
wise, in the Commission’s work, Isaac
ventilates the idea that the fixation
of wages is at the very least akin in
importance to the making of decisions
in any of the key areas of economic
and monetary policy. As such, he
thinks it should be done in camera,
free from overt public pressures, such
as one gets at public hearings. If this
would be a drastic departure from
present practice, he suggests it would
indeed be strange if our monetary
policy were determined at public
hearings, and that every time the
Reserve Bank planned to increase or
lower SRDs or vary the rate of inter-
est the public and the commercial
banks and others were to be allowed
in to state their case. It would, in-
deed. His suggestion is not likely to
be adopted, perhaps, but it is worth
considering.
Equally intriguing is his proposal to
do away with some at least of the
remaining “judicial antecedents of the
Commission.” A lot of the old ones
have, of course, gone by the board in
more recent streamlining. We now have
“pronouncements” instead of “judg-
ments.” Wigs have been discarded these
many years. But Isaac is not satisfied.
He wants to do away with the process
of cross-examination of witnesses by
counsel representing the parties. He
thinks it is desirable, in fact, to dis-
pense with counsel altogether. On this
he says: “Much of the most valuable
aspects of the evidence in economic
cases is a mixture of expert techni-

cal competence and soundness of judg-
ment; cross - 'examination seeks to
destroy evidence, to create doubt, to
dim the evidence, rather than to throw
light on the subject. This may be
entirely sensible in criminal and civil
proceedings, but it is hardly helpful in
the kind of inquiries the Commission
is engaged in. If experts have provided
any useful guidance to Commissions
(sic), they have done so despite cross-
examination.”
In his search for more enlightened
wage-fixing procedures, Isaac empha-
sises the essentiality of the Common-
wealth Government’s usually much-
criticised interventions and wants to
make them more telling. He recog-
nises that this would require some
drastic procedural changes, but it is
not enough, he claims, for the Govern-
ment mcrelv to “assist” the Commis-
Sir Richard Kirby: talks to economists
sion by providing statistical informa-
tion about the state of the economy
and to make guarded, non-committal,
and vague statements about the
dangers to the economy from excessive
wage increase.
“The Government’s powers,” he
states, “with regard to taxation, sub-
sidies, social services, banking, anti-
restrictive trade practices, tariff policy,
etc., must be brought to bear directly
on the discussions on wages. This is
the only hope of achieving any com-
promise and co-operation, however
grudgingly, from unions and employers
on the appropriate increase in money
incomes and share of wages in it. To
say that the Government must take a
more active part and be more deeply
committed in the framing of a wage
or incomes policy does not mean that
the responsibility for this policy should
rest with the Government. The strong
tradition of an independent body in
wage fixing makes it necessary for an
independent body like the Commission
to continue to bear the ultimate res-
ponsibility for any decisions which are
made.”

SPECULATOR’S
DIARY
Some robust health
grips the
stock exchanges
COUGHS, COLDS, and flu germs
are the order of the day. Cold-bars
with mountains of enticing-looking
medicines and antiseptic women are
featuring strongly on TV. Office staffs
are thinning, sick beds are filling, and
doctors and chemists are flat out. Thus
we begin a new financial year. Happily,
the healthiest starter in the 1967/68
stakes is the Stock Exchange. The
Sydney index closed at a brisk 368.41
on the first day of the new year, just
10.8 points below its highest-ever peak.
Its robust condition is now almost
entirely attributable to the sector most
likely to excite in 1968—mining. Action
in this division was so frantic during
1967 that turnover was an energetic 68
percent higher than in the previous
year.
A non-mining company which looks
healthy at current prices is Dwyers.
This company is the major General
Motors dealer in Wollongong, one of
Australia’s fastest-growing cities. I first
thought of them when I read that
Holden sales for June had hit their
highest level in two years. I was again
reminded of them when a GM-H Press
release stated that the Torana was
going great guns and represented the
“best penetration into the lower
medium-price group in its history.”
The final factor convincing me that
Dwyers were for me was John A. Gil-
bert’s result. After being down 16
percent in the first nine months of the
year, Gilberts did so well in the past
three months that the trend was com-
pletely reversed and a 6.9 percent
profit gain was recorded. I figured if
Gilberts could do so well with only
three months’ good trading, Dwyers
should do quite a business in the six
months available to them. Gilberts rule
off their books in March, while Dwyers
balance in June; hence the additional
three months of prime trading avail-
able to Dwyers.
A stock not to be sneezed at is
Australian National Industries. True,
its past career has been somewhat
checkered, but not, in my opinion, as
murky as the current market price
would suggest. I can’t see why the
stock should be selling at only 60 per-
cent of its par value and yielding a
sky-high 10.7 percent. It has earned
profits (of varying sizes, admittedly)
every year since 1928 and has only
twice missed on paying dividends dur-
ing that time. Last year it earned
$494,000, equal to 9.4 percent of its
capital, and looks like doing better this
year. Just to show that I thought the
market was temporarily out in its judg-
ment, I bought 400 in the hope that I
wasn’t.
I hasten to point out, however, that
I didn’t buy the stock just because of
its past history, but that I took a look
at its immediate prospects. These
seemed OK. The company holds about
60 local and overseas franchises for
the merchandising of various steel,
aluminium, and engineering products.
These range from two-stroke gasoline
motors to coke ovens and cranes. If
William Adams’ recent results in these
divisions are any guide, ANI should
have also had a good year. The distri-
bution of Comalco aluminium should,
in particular, prove to be a lucrative
and growing side of the business. On
the other hand, ANI is in the forging
industry, and, in fact, has the largest
hot-forging business in the land. This
division did not do well last year;
directors have predicted that there will
be no substantial improvement this
year. It should, however, benefit to
some degree from the improved motor
vehicle registrations and from its
export orders to U.S.A., which com-
menced for the first time during the
year just ended.
This week I bought the sold ham-
mer down on Geoff K. Gray when the
stock reached $1.15. Probably I could
have got $1.20 if I had been willing
to wait an extra day or two, yet past
experience has taught me it doesn’t
pay to try to squeeze out every last
drop of profit. I was also worried about
the lack of turnover in this stock. My
other sale for the week was Thiess.
Thanks to that “Golden Password,”
nickel, I was able to sell out here at
$1.73. The whole deal, which was
spread over a period of eight weeks,
landed me a very handy profit of
$155.00 after brokerage.

Chasing the tail of Motels Aust.
MINING • SHARE LIST • BEHIND THE BALANCE SHEETS
MARKET POINTERS • SECURITY ANALYSIS • COMMODITIES
MOTELS OF AUSTRALIA, which
has always been more appreciated by its
powerful associates in Canada, the U.S.,
and England than at home, has not
yet “come good” for its local share-
holders. And it does not look like fully
doing so for a couple of years. But
when it does, current prices around the
30 cents mark will look very small
indeed, even though this is near their
best levels for the year.
The coming result for the year to
June 30 will no doubt reinforce the
view that the business is still in its very
dull stage for profitability. But it
should not be many years before the
group’s 15 percent earning rate is at
least doubled. The dividend rate should
be restored to 12 J percent much sooner.
The fact of the group’s likely im-
provement are available from a close
study of the accounts for 1965-66.
These reveal special reasons for the
current dullness and indicate the sort
of profits likely when the “special
reasons” depart and earlier profit-guest
ratios are restored.
Until the group stops its headlong
expansion, its full potential profitability
on its units can never be fully attained
in any one year’s accounts; yet it must
expand to get the benefits of size that
are vital to its real success. This chas-
ing its own tail will probably slow-
down in a couple of years, and pro-
vided it has avoided making too many
mistakes on locations, costs, or capitalis-
ation, profits should then begin to
reflect the rewards that are in this
business for good operators. The first
benefits should begin to show in 1967-
68; for even though the chain is expand-
ing the number of motel rooms by a
huge 50 percent in coming years, it will
be mainly through its new partnership
with the U.K. Trust Houses group and
so will only have a small direct impact
on the company.
In the year that just ended, Motels of
Australia probably had about one mil-
lion guests, and if the previous year’s
average rate of profit per guest had been
maintained at 93 cents, the company
would be reporting a profit of around
the $930,000 mark. But the group’s
profit per guest ratio appears to have
fallen further in 1966-67, as in the first
half of the year the 14 percent rise in
guests brought only a 12 percent lift
to motel operating profits. In addition,
building and manufacturing profits will
be down this year. On the other hand,
there was an increase of guest tariffs
that applied for half of 1965-66 that
lifted the average value of room sales
per guest from $4.13 to $4.51; its im-
pact for a full year will naturally have
a further upwards impact on this ratio.
So it seems likely that profits per
guest will be down around the 90 cents
mark, to give a net profit for the 1966-
67 of around $900,000, or only a little
better than the previous year’s drought-
affected $872,408. Evidence of the
poorer average returns from the motel
operation in 1965-66 (which has flowed
over into 1966-67) lies basically in the
fall in the average number of guests
per room during the year from 552 to
470.
The implications of this for current
profits are clearly bad; but for future
profits they are significant on the
right side. The main reason for
the present poorer-looking motel returns
is that the chain has been expanding
so fast (30 percent more rooms were
added in 1965-66) that a large propor-
tion of them have only been in service
for a part of the year. On top of that,
Jason appears this week on page 57.
it takes a year or so before a new
motel works itself up to the sort of
occupancy figures that come when it is
well known. There seems little doubt
that when the bout of solid expansion
within the Motels of Australia group
itself calms down this year, there will
be every prospect of the group’s
occupancy rate being at least restored
to the 550-odd rate of 1965 and
possibly a bit higher.
At the same time, there is also every
prospect of the profit per guest ratio
being restored to levels much closer to
$1 a head than the present returns
around 90 cents (and there are higher
tariffs to offset the higher operating
costs since such a return existed in
1964 and 1965). Even at the current
number of about 2400 rooms, the appli-
cation of these averages would bring
in a net profit of about $1.3 million
(almost 50 percent higher than last
year’s net).
But this sort of sum cannot be done
for the 3673 rooms target that the
chain has set (which would mean a
net profit of about $2.1 million in these
terms), because most of the additional
rooms will not be owned by Motels of
Australia itself. Its Trust Houses part-
nership will be the centre of all but
a fraction of the development in com-
ing years, and so, apart from earning
management fees, Motels of Australia
will be entitled to only half the profits
from these additional rooms.
Taking all this into account sug-
gests a target net profit level of around
$1.6 million, once the group settles
down in a few years’ time (provided
the demands of expansion that come
with mounting tourism do not force it
into even further rapid expansion).
Such a profit, almost double that for
1965-66, would lift earning rate to
almost 30 percent. •
In the meantime, expansion is cer-
tainly having its impact on profits. And
it is costing more than ever before; in
1965-66 the average cost of the rooms
owned by Motels of Australia was
$9lOO, or significantly higher than
the average of $BBOO in the previous
year and only $B6OO the year before.
The answer is not that the rooms are
becoming so much more palatial, but
that they are being built in more expen-
sive locations and so are costing more.
The group has been concentrating its
building activities in city areas, where
land is far dearer than in the country.
These locations also demand lifts and
air conditioning.
This big increase in the number of
rooms by the end of the year that had
not been in use for the full year may
also explain the slight fall in deprecL
ation and amortisation charge per room
in the 1965-66 accounts to only $l4l.
The company follows the general Aus-
tralian habit of not depreciating its
buildings on freeholds simply because
the tax collector does not allow it. This
seems unwise in a chain that exists
in many country areas, where increas-
ing land values will not serve to offset
the inevitable aging of the building.
To some extent the disturbances to
profit by rapid expansion have been
offset by the company doing some of
its own construction (with the con-
struction subsidiary taking in profits
on the cost of building motels for the
group; in theory, this could be used to
give the group’s current accounts a
buoyant look at the cost of future
profits). For example, more than one-
third of last year’s group profit rise of
only $50,000 came from profits the
building subsidiary earned out of the
rest of the group. And it appears that
the operating profit of the manufac-
turing and construction operations (the
difference between their income and
the cost of their sales but not their
share of overhead expenses) jumped
by almost 80 percent to $398,347, while
the same figure for room and food and


beverage operations shows a modest
rise of only 17 percent to $2.9 million.
The building and manufacturing oper-
ations benefited in 1965-66 from two
large external contracts; in the year
that has just ended there were no such
benefits. In addition, the amount of
work being done for the group fell
(it is not large now), so the con-
tribution from this section of the oper-
ation to the 1966-67 profit will be
smaller.
Even though the chain is to continue
expanding through the Trust Houses
partnership, this expansion will not
bring the same disturbances to profit-
ability and will not create any added
strains on funds. For the group’s initial
contribution to the partnership was in
kind rather than cash as it handed over
four motels. Its future contributions
will be in cash, but in amounts that
can be largely catered for out of cash
flow; in the 1965-66 accounts there was
about $300,000 left over from net profit
after the 10 percent dividend was paid.
The 12 percent rise in motel oper-
ating profit was despite losing half
the profits of the four motels trans-
ferred to T. H. Motels. There was an
additional capital profit of $211,000
from the sale of motels.
In July, 1966, the largest hotel and
accommodation company in Britain,
Trust Houses Ltd., with 205 hotels in
Britain and the Continent, joined with
Motels of Australia to form a partner-
ship, T. H. Motels, to acquire, erect,
and conduct a chain of new motels
and motor hotels in Australia, New
Zealand, and Fiji. Trust Houses con-
tribution was sl.sm. cash, and Motels
of Australia’s the equivalent in motels.
This involved the transfer of four of
its newest motels. Motels of Australia
takes a management fee, and the T. H.
Motels properties form part of the
whole chain of TraveLodge, Holiday
Inns, Caravilles, and Reef Motels. Of
the 1290 motel rooms now planned for
addition to the chain (increasing it by
50 percent), 1200 or so are to be in
the T.H. partnership, leaving only a
few to be added to Motels of Australia
itself. The Motels of Australia net-
work is now represented in most volume
areas, and the partnership’s present
plans will fill most gaps. The company
is not yet represented in the size re-
quired in many places, hence the exten-
sion or duplication of motel facilities
in major cities.
It seems likely, then, that share-
holders will not be asked to contribute
to this expansion, particularly follow-
ing the October, 1966, statement that
negotiations were well advanced for
long-term fixed loans to supplement the
equity provided by Trust Houses of the
U.K. and Motels of Australia in their
50-50 partnership. The deputy chair-
man and managing director of Motels
of Australia, Mr. C. A. Greenway,
wants to improve the earning rate and
dividend rate before asking share-
holders for further financial contri-
butions.
Although resort to bank accommoda-
tion ($581,000 at June 30, 1966) and
the near maturity of secured and un-
secured loans lowered the current ratio
for last financial year, this seems in-
evitable when money is tied up in new
motels under construction and not yet
productive. It is also inevitable, no
matter how unpleasant, that term
liabilities of the company of nearly
slom far exceed shareholders’ funds of
sB.9m which are subject to intangibles
of $2,144,000.
Links with institutions seem pretty
well forged, for most of the s6m.
secured loans repayable beyond 1967
balance date would be with institutions
that have advanced money on first
mortgage on specific properties. The
figure respresents a conglomeration of
small mortgages. It is company policy
to reduce the currency of long-term
mortgages to minimise the risk of bor-
rower and lender, and mortgages are
arranged on 66 percent of the land and
building valuation. Leasing is now being

employed by the group as a method of
achieving gearing.
The most significant source of funds,
however, was the provision of an 8
percent SU.S.4m. ($A.3.6m.) by Power
Corporation of Canada Ltd. in 1964.
Among its many interests, Power owns
the biggest travel agency in Canada,
and has substantial hotel links in
Canada and the Bahamas. Empire
International Corporation of New York,
and other parties who were instru-
mental in bringing the Power associ-
ation about, acquired options to take
up 1,230,000 Motels of Australia
shares at 17c premium within five
years. If the options are taken up,
this would represent 11 percent of
present capital, but it seems unlikely
that the U.S. group could take up such
an interest in view of the present U.S.
restraints on capital outflow.
Not the least of the benefits from the
financial link with Power were
analyses preceding the deal by the
U.S. firm of Harris Kerr, Forster, and
Co. which projected the company’s
future and steered it along well-
established guide lines of accommoda-
tion development. It probably moti-
vated the company to adopt a style of
reporting in accordance with the uni-
form system of accounts common to
all U.S. accommodation chains. The
HKF report made projections of over-
seas tourists who would come to Aus-
tralia, and what they would spend
through to 1975, predicting that over-
seas tourists would increase from
132,000 in 1964 to 320,000 in 1970
and 607,000 in 1975, spending from
$61.6m. in 1964 to $120.4m. in 1970
and $207.6m. in 1975.
So far, the HKF visitor spending
estimates have been very accurate
although they may have underestimated
the volume of tourists, because in 1965
there was little talk of jumbo jets, now
expected in 1970-71, or of a reduced
air-fare structure across the Pacific.
Consequently the Australian National
Travel Association has upped the HKF
estimates to 400,000 people by 1970,
compared with 211,000 who actually
arrived in 1966.
The potential of computerised referal
systems are recognised, and as costs
decrease and volume increases, Motels
of Australia hopes to link in with the
computer services of international air-
lines, who can thus sell accommoda-
tion with the fare.
The company has an unsuccessful in-
vestment in Rushcutter Ltd. which
operates the Rushcutter Bowl and
TraveLodge motel. Motel profits have
been sufficient for Motels of Australia
to earn its management fee each year,
but this is nominal and there has been
no dividend on its investment. Shares
and debentures in listed companies, in
Motels of Australia’s books at $232,266,
had a market value of $66,420 at last
balance date, no doubt less now, and
the company would be wise to pro-
vide accordingly.
In the past four years there have been
substantial tax savings on losses
acquired, and the number of small sub-
sidiaries allowed the company to pay
only 37f percent tax on their profits.
The company will be absorbing more
losses in 1966-67, but there should not
be much left to carry forward into
1968. The burden of interest and mort-
gage expense (up from $603,000 to
$820,000, almost equal to final net
profit) may be greater in 1966-67 be-
cause of a full service charge on the
Power loan, but perhaps it will be rela-
tively less burdensome within the next
couple of years with the leasing of
major projects. A fair ingredient of
bank accommodation in 1965-66 re-
duced the average rate of interest paid
on total borrowings from about 8 to 7.1
percent.
The large intangibles, including
sl.7m. of goodwill, $220,000 cost of
borrowing less amounts written off, and
$200,000 expenses and interest to be
charged against future revenues, give
the impression the company stretches
itself to show the brightest possible pic-
ture. Nonetheless, the 50c shares at
68c or thereabouts are a fair buy for
income (with a chance of resumption of
12| percent dividends in a year or two)
and it is one of the most outstanding
examples of likely beneficiaries in the
coming tourist rush.

On issue hopes
from Myers
THE RISE IN MYER shares last week
took them over $3.80 before profit-
takers moved in and the price settled
around $3.70. The shares have been
steadily recommended at well below
this level in The Bulletin earlier this
year. It seems they may still be worth
buying but only for the daring at
these prices. Last week’s price rise
pushed the dividend yield down to a
paltry percent. This means the
market has almost put Myers in the
BHP-CRA-WMC class. There will have
to be early evidence of some reward
to keep them at current prices for
very long, otherwise there could be
a sharp reaction.
The rise appeared to be inspired by
hopes of a bonus issue this year. These
have been lurking in the background
for some months now and news of the
jump in retail sales during May was
just what eager buyers needed to un-
leash their enthusiasm completely. It
has been estimated that the retailing
giant will earn 50 percent on its capital
in the current year to July 31. Its
1967-68 outlook is brighter than almost
any other year the group has faced,
so if shareholders are to get anything
special now seems as good a time as
any.
There have been only two issues
to shareholders since 1950, both bonuses
on a very generous basis. The 1960-61
issue was on a one-for-two basis; the
general consensus is that this is the
best that can be hoped for this year.
The company was earning nowhere
near 50 percent when the previous
issues were made, so there is plenty
of scope from the performance view-
point.
The previous issues both followed a
revaluation of assets and there has
been no further revaluation since
1960-61. It is heartening to note the
last balance sheet revealed reserves
which were large enough to support an
issue even without a revaluation.
Reserves were more than double paid
capital. There was enough in the share
premiums reserve alone to support an
issue on a one-for-two basis.
So the market is ready and waiting,
and anyone willing to take the gamble
could still make money. Scrip in com-
panies like Myer has a pleasant habit
of coming on to the market ex-bonus
at levels which are not too far removed
from their pre-bonus price. A bonus
J s the most likely benefit for share-
holders this year, as an increased divi-
dend would merely be a disappoint-
ment to the market this move is
unlikely, anyway, because the group is
already distributing at a peak 171 per-
cent rate.
As the group is not in any great need
of funds, a cash issue also seems un-
likely. However, it is not completely
beyond the realms of possibility and it
should be remembered that the high
market premium on the shares would
make a par issue very close to a free
handout in real terms.

THE HIRE PURCHASE industry has
a remarkable ability to survive crises;
it has managed to overcome the prob-
lems set by foreign banks buying their
way into the business, local motor
manufacturers taking a bigger stake in
their own hire purchase, and a general
decline in credit sales financed through
these companies. It faces a new chal-
lenge now in the Bankers Development
Refinance scheme, which could well be
a serious rival on the borrowing market
(so far most of its challenges have
come from the other end of its opera-
tions). But with motor registrations
now looking up and consumer spending
a bit brighter, with everyone confi-
dently predicting better times in the
economy this financial year, and with
the likelihood of a tightening in bank
lending, it would seem that the hire

be good buying. It would probably be
best to stick to the leaders in the field,
picking out those which are showing
the highest dividend yields; it is with
them that there is most room for a
rise in prices.
The choice seems to boil down to
four CAGA at $1.40 and yielding
7.1 percent, FCA at $1.62 and yielding
6.2 percent, General Credits at 66 cents
and yielding 6.1 percent, lAC at 94
cents and yielding 6.4 percent. CAGA is
the odd one out on a yield basis be-
cause it does not seem to have been
performing as well as the others. Of
course, this gives it more room for
improvement than the others and it
could prove, over a year or so, to be
the best choice of the four,
lAC should appeal to those who go
for real strength, while FCA, usually
a reliable performer, may be a bit
risky if the depressed conditions in
South Australia have been worrying
it at all.
General Credits has been widely
recommended over the past few weeks
and seems to be emerging from the
mediocrity which has afflicted it for
so long. Profits jumped 17.7 percent in
1966-67 to return 13.6 percent on
capital. A repeat performance over the
next 12 months could well inspire
directors to lift the eight percent divi-
dend. The wide base of the group’s
business gives it added appeal.
PERMEWAN WRIGHT’S 50 cent
shares seem good buying for growth
in the medium to long term at their
present 90 cents. A steady 1211 percent
dividend for 1966-67 was announced
last week, and this provides a return
of almost seven percent on capital at
the current market price. The group’s
profits were 24.8 percent lower in the
first half of the year, but only 5.8 per-
cent down by the time the full 12
months was up. This represented a
strong recovery and one which should
be continuing in the current year. The
profit in the final half of 1966-67 was
equal to an annual earning rate of 21.3
percent on capital, including shares
from last year’s issue.
Investors tend to forget that the
group is becoming further and further
removed from the rural scene and the
widely fluctuating fortunes which
accompany it. As a food retailer, it
now ranks only after Coles and Wool-
worths in Victoria.
The trend established in the second
half must have been partially due to
the management rearrangement which
followed the death of Sir John Allison
last year. This, combined with the
rising emphasis on groceries and a
complete recovery from the problems
of the drought, seem to ensure a period
of growth for the company which
should eventually be reflected in the
market by a rise in the share price.
INDUSTRIAL ENGINEERING’S $1
million contract with the Department
of the Army has put the group’s foot
in what should prove to be a lucrative
door, one which should help lift profits
higher in the current year. Despite
this, and the good year which the
group should have just completed, the
$1 shares are going for only $1.60,
where they yield an enticing 1\ percent
from the 12 percent dividend expected
this year.
Payout was raised from 10 to 11
percent in 1965-66 after profit had
peaked to return more than 20 percent
on capital. In the first half of the
latest year, interim payout was raised
from five to six percent after a seven
percent rise in profits. Directors ex-
pected a good finish to the year, and
it will be very surprising if the final
payout is not held at six percent.
A big boost should come the group’s
way once it gets into supplying the
automotive industry in earnest. The
group is just starting to move into this
field in a big way, and its excellent
reputation as an engineer should win
it plenty of customers. The success
which is expected should eventually
lead to another issue to shareholders.

You hold this man’s job in your hands.
When Mr. Wridgway Snr. bought his first van
and did his first moving job, he vowed:
“A removalist’s job is more than picking up
and putting down. It is care and personal
courtesy. It is a specialist’s job.”
That tradition is maintained at WridgWays
today. It has made WridgWays one of the
largest removalists in Australia and cer-
tainly the most experienced.
And to maintain this position we have to
maintain our standards.
That’s why we run scheduled services to every
major centre in Australia and all stops in
between. No other removalist does this. When
you move interstate with WridgWays, there’s
no waiting for a van to be filled with other
consignments.
We have the greatest number of interstate
branches. We can’t predict when you’ll want
to move, or from where to where. So we’re
everywhere. That’s our standard.
Now about that man above. We don’t think
he’ll drop that vase, or let you down in any
way. We’re sure that all of our trained em-
ployees live up to our standards of expert
handling and personal courtesy.
After all, Mr. Wridgway Snr. still works here.

Stocks to benefit
A grand parade for 1967-68
By JASON
IT’S ALL VERY WELL for everyone
to be predicting a better stockmarket
for 1967-68 (despite the shortage of
investible cash that could well develop
as the year progresses). And there seems
no doubt at all that the economic
situation generally will be very much
brighter than last year, so that many
of the soft spots in the economy may
well be hardened up a bit.
But what will be the stocks to benefit
from these better times? There are not
many clear-cut areas of activity ripe
for obvious advance, although there are
some like motor parts makers, textilers,
appliance makers, and banks that
clearly have scope for improvement in
the current financial year. And there
are some stocks that give every impres-
sion of being undervalued in the context
of t e grea er ae tvt y ey sou now
t C ' , r- . i ,
In the first p ace, there are severa
leaders that should continue the rise that
,i,.. . . ~
has marked their recent history on the

greater things; CRA should do so, but
a may take longer; Burns Phtlp and
W. R. Carpenter should both recover;
ACl’s rise should continue; so should
Myers; there should be better times
ahead for the Bank of N.S.W. and the
CBC.
Although the building industry is re-
maining sluggish in some areas, like
South Australia, there is room for
significant improvement in share prices
of J. Mcllwraith, Humes, Concrete
Industries, James Hardie, Wunderlich,
and Blue Metal Industries.
In textiles, where the index fell last
financial year, Universal Textiles and
Bradford Cotton look very cheap,
indeed; in Western Australia, Swan
Brewery, Boans, and the disappointing
but übiquitous Bell Bros, should put in
better results, in an economy that
should be getting many benefits from its
local boom; in retailing (another de-
pressed area last year), Waltons and
Grace Bros, should join the upward
trend already set by Myers; in appli-
ances, Electronic Industries is past the
worst and so is Pye.
Others that should be looking up are
suppliers to industry, like Protector
Safety Industries, William Adams, O.
t. Lempriere, and Boral; container and
packaging companies like Containers
Ltd., Queensland Can, British Tobacco,
and j Fielding; transport companies
(they fell far too severely last year)
like Brambles and Mayne Nickless,
. Bu , one of the most interesting of
them all as a speculative proposition is
United Telecasters, the operator of
channel 10> Sydney. Now that Mr.
D * at a at t + j •
Rupert Murdochs News Ltd. group is
_ , , , , .-r , . r .
no longer a shareholder in lelevision
Corporation, there seems every chance
tha , p the News could become
attracted , 0 the
merits of Channel 10.
A NEW ELEMENT of speculation
will be available to the Australian
nickel-punter when the Edinburgh-
based Hampton Properties are granted
the listing they are seeking on Austra-
lian stock exchanges in Melbourne,
Adelaide, and Perth. Last week the
company’s agreement with Great
Boulder Gold Mines over Location 45
on Hampton Plains was announced;
this entails 20 percent equity in the
operation, no royalties, and no call for
capital outlay.
Meanwhile the extent of Australian
buying of this stock so far has been
pointed up by a single sale of 25,000
shares through the Stock Exchange of
Perth. This represents 5 percent of the
company’s total shareholding.
Hampton Properties’ stake in the
nickel boom will be tied directly with
Great Boulder’s. Allowing $2 million
for Great Boulder’s goldmining ventures
(being given a potential fillip by merger
discussions with Lake View and Star),
their nickel capitalisation with the
share price at $4 would give Hampton
Properties a theoretical price of $6. If
a circular to clients by Melbourne’s
Argus Investment Services is accurate,
then anything goes. This forecast, for
Great Boulder, a short-term rise to be-
tween $6 and $7, to move to $lO this
year, and with $2O not beyond longer-
term range; for Hampton Properties
the equivalent prices would be $9 to
$lO, $16.50 and $34!
THE RETAIL STOCKS have been
getting a lot of support on these pages
in recent times, particularly Myers,
which has been one of Jason’s most
frequently recommended stocks (next
to BHP and ACI). This enthusiasm
for Myers was despite a very unim-
pressive look the Chartist gave to this
stock (and to retailers in general) in
the “No hurry to buy” article that
appeared on May 6. In it the Chartist
said that retail stocks seemed to be
near the bottom, but that a general
sideways trend seemed likely, with
Waltons being the one in the most
favorable situation for recovery.
The Chartist now says, however,
that since that general review on the
retail leaders, current market action
now suggests that a reversal of trend
is likely for this group during the next
few months. “It is quite likely that re-
tailers generally will not fall below
the low points recorded in 1966. Wal-
tons and the Myer Emporium will un-
doubtedly give the best performance.”
This more bullish view is in line with
the “fundamental” one expressed here
over recent months, and which has
already brought significant rewards for
those who acted on the advice about
Myers. Another stock that seems likely
to improve is Grace Bros., which was
not induded in May’s retail survey,
but which is still below its levels of
a year or so ae:o even though the out-
look is much brighter.
The Chartist says:
THE MYER EMPORIUM LTD. came under technical review along with the retail
leaders in May of this year. It was still basically in a downtrend at that stage,
but the price movements over the past few weeks have now decisively broken
the downward trend evident since 1964. Prices have already risen to $3.85 and,
although some short-term reaction might be expected, the base consolidation
suggests that a target close to $5.10 could ultimately he achieved in the longer
term. This stock still appears to be in a growth phase and after $4.00 there are
no resistance levels, which usually indicates a faster rate of appreciation. Last sale
price on 4/7/67 $3.75.


Painful
Hemorrhoids
—
It strikes 7 out of every 10 people in
all walks of life. Yet many otherwise
intelligent people know little of its dan-
gers. Piles (hemorrhoids) are aggra-
vated by many factors —including
over-exertion and unsuitable diet.
Neglect—and reliance on superficial
relief —invites serious medical conse-
quences. Eight years’ Swiss research
developed Varemoid Tablets —now
regarded by overseas specialists as the
leading anti-inflammatory treatment
for piles. Remarkable improvement is
being achieved—even with sufferers
of over 20 years. A week’s course
will convince you.

Security analysis
Known and unknown factors
for Conzinc Riotinto
OVER THE PAST seven years, the
market image of Conzinc Riotinto of
Australia Limited has been completely
transformed. In January, 1961, the
Rio Tinto Mining Company of Aus-
tralia Ltd. made a public placement of
1 million 50c shares at 70c each; those
investors who were lucky enough to
participate in this issue would now
hold, 2 cash and 2 bonus issues later,
nearly 300 shares in CRA worth almost
$2400 (assuming an initial holding of
100 Rio Tinto shares). The total
cost of taking up entitlements in the
September, 1962, and March, 1965, cash
issues would have been almost $260,
so that for an outlay of $330 the in-
vestment would now be yielding over
7 percent p.a., based on CRA’s current
dividend of 8 cents per share, as com-
pared with the present dividend yield
of only 1 percent at CRA’s current
market price of SB.
Since the earnings yield on CRA’s
shares is currently only 2 percent
(indicating a price/earnings multiple of
50 based on 1966 earnings), it is clear
that dramatic increases in future profit-
ability are expected (and required) to
justify such a share price. It is worth
noting here that I will not dwell on
whether CRA is “overpriced” and/or
RTZ of the U.K. “underpriced.” Suf-
ficient commentators have pointed out
how RTZ (which owns 85 percent of
CRA) has a total market capitalisation'
not far in excess of its share of CRA’s
market capitalisation, even though 61
percent of its assets are located outside
Australia.
A feature of CRA’s most informative
annual accounts is the disclosed percent-
age break-down of group assets
employed, sales revenue, and profits by
the company’s various activities. In
recent years lead-zinc mining and
smelting has contributed the bulk of
CRA’s profits, as the following schedule
indicates:
C.R.A.’s source of profits (%)
1965 1966
Lead/zinc mining 63 1 53 1
Lead/zinc smelting 14 6 20 1
Aluminium 55 99
Copper 0 9 7 9
Building Materials 15 3 5
Iron ore 2.8
Sundry 14 4 27
By contrast, over one-third of
CRA’s assets are now invested in its
iron-ore activities, as the following
schedule indicates:
C.R.A.’s employment of assets
1965 1966
i($’000) % Total ($’000) % Total
Iron ore 45,132 23 3 81,393 35 6
Aluminium 29,356 15 1 31,049 13 6
Lead/zinc mining 23,262 12 0 24,588 10 8
Lead/zinc smelting 14,710 7 6 18,939 8 3
Acid/fertilisers chemicals 14,450 7 4 11,303 5 0
Copper 5,042 2 6 4,154 1 8
All other assets 61,802 32 0 56,976 24 9
193,754 100 0 228,402 100 0
However, although CRA’s iron-ore
interests accounted for 35.6 percent of
group assets as at December 31, 1966,
and provided only 2.8 percent of 1966
profits, 42.5 percent of CRA’s present
share price is due to its 54 percent
holding in Hamersley Holdings Ltd.
(At a valuation of $5 per Hamersley
share, each CRA share is worth $3.40
due to the Hamersley interest.)
Although Hamersley’s first shipment
of iron-ore was loaded as recently as
August, 1966, the venture has become
highly profitable almost immediately.
In the three months to March 31,
1967, Hamersley’s profit was $1,416,000
after depreciation of $1,560,000. In the
prospectus of Hamersley, directors
estimated that by 1972 sales of iron-
ore and iron oxide pellets would reach
ten million tons p.a., and that con-
solidated profit (after allowing for
current and future income tax) would
be at an annual rate of not less than
$22 million by the close of 1970. In
the rash of brokers’ circulars that fol-
lowed hard on the heels of the Hamers-
ley prospectus, profit estimates were
generally somewhat higher, ranging up
to S2B million for 1970 and over S4O
million for 1975 (based on sales of
15 million tons of ore and pellets).
Not long after the release of the
Hamersley prospectus, however, it was
announced that the shipping capacity
of the venture would reach ten mil-
lion tons of ore p.a. by the end of
1968, indicating that Hamersley will
be in a position to ship greater quan-
tities of ore in the years 1967 to 1972
than those used in the prospectus cal-
culations. Consequently, it would not
surprise if CRA’s proportion of
Hamersley’s 1970 profits reached sls
mi’lion (or 1J times CRA’s 1966 group
profits).
CRA’s 50 percent interest in
Comalco Industries Pty. Ltd. is already
now providing almost 10 percent of
its group profits. In 1966, Comalco’s
group profit totalled $4.3 million, and
dividends paid $2.4 million. Profits in
the current calendar year are expected
to be “substantially greater.” CRA’s
aluminium interests will benefit further
should Queensland Alumina Ltd.’s
recently completed Gladstone plant (8
percent owned by CRA) be doubled
in capacity, since Comalco’s Weipa
bauxite shipments would increase by
another 1.2 million tons p.a. In general,
the long-term outlook for CRA’s alu-
minium interests seems excellent.
Undoubtedly CRA’s successful
exploration program to date is being
accorded a significant valuation by the
share market. CRA’s “expenditure on
exploration and development” has
totalled over $6.5 million in the past
three years. Important recent dis-
coveries include the Bougainville

Island copper/gold mining prospect
(in which CRA has a two-thirds inter-
est) and the Anaconda drill hole inter-
section of “important nickel and cop-
per values” south of Kambalda (in
which CRA’s interest is 26 2-3rd per-
cent). With respect to the nickel strike
(which caused CRA’s shares to jump
from $7.20 to a peak of $9), it is worth
noting that, even if a nickel field with
the prospects of Western Mining’s can
be proven, this would only be
equivalent to around 60 cents per CRA
share (assuming that sls per WMC
share is due to the nickel element).
CRA does have, in addition, two leases
in its own right in the Kambalda area.
The Bougainville Island copper
prospect now seems destined to become
an important source of future profits
for CRA. The quantity of ore indi-
cated by diamond drilling is now “con-
siderably greater” than 90 million tons
assaying 0.63 percent copper and 0.58
dwt per ton gold. As is becoming
customary these days, the first detailed
statement on this prospect came from
an interested Member of Parliament.
The Minister for Territories recently
stated that CRA had already spent
$4 million in exploration work at
Bougainville and was in the process of
spending another $6 million during the
current year. A total investment
“well in excess” of SIOO million will
be involved and annual ore treatment
of up to ten million tons p.a. is envis-
aged. An operation of this mag-
nitude is likely by the mid-1970s to
produce metal worth over SSO million;
if the project earns ten percent p.a. on
its invested funds, an annual profit
of $lO million could accrue. CRA’s
proportion, after allowing for 20 per-
cent local equity would, on this basis,
approximate $5 million.
Whilst it is not possible in the
limited space to discuss CRA’s numer-
ous remaining interests, the foregoing
appears to indicate that CRA’s current
price could well be justified on the
basis of known facts, without including
any valuation for the company’s
exploration program. An important
unknown factor relates to the manner
in which CRA proposes to double the
local equity. Certain listed mining
companies have been singled out as
possible CRA takeover propositions,
but RTZ could follow earlier precedent
by not taking up its full entitlement
to any future CRA cash issue.

Mining
An outline of tax deductions
IT IS NOT OFTEN that the Govern-
ment openly encourages speculation.
But at this time of the year those who
have risked their money on mining
ventures are thankful for the assistance
given by the deductions available to
them when computing their taxation
returns. Perhaps the legislators would
prefer to use the term “investing in the
search for oil, or useful minerals,” or
some other phrase which does not
carry the hint of approval given to
speculation.
Nevertheless, the tax concessions
which the Government makes to those
who put up their money to finance oil
and mineral exploration companies do
provide recognition of the high risk
associated with this type of “invest-
ment” and the real need that does
exist for the encouragement of those
hardy souls who have paid call after
call on oil shares for no return at all.
Without the assistance which the tax
concessions give, it is very doubtful
whether it would have been possible
to raise a high proportion of the sums
which have been subscribed to oil and
metal exploration companies.
During the tax year which has just
ended there were several issues and
calls made by oil exploration com-
panies. Under Section 77A of the tax
legislation, moneys paid to such com-
panies may be claimed in full as
deductions from taxable income.
Among the issues and calls made dur-
ing the year there is only one excep-
tion to this—Magellan Petroleum,
which made an issue at a premium of
30 cents. The 50 cents application
money for capital paid to Magellan
may be deducted in full, but the 30
cents premium paid to the company
is not allowed as a full deduction
under Section 77A. It is, however,
allowed as to one-third (i.e., 10 cents)
under Section 78(1) (b).
Other oil exploration companies
which made issues or calls during the
year are: Alliance Oil Development,
Amalgamated Petroleum, Associated
Australian Oilfields, Farmout Drillers,
Associated Continental Petroleum,
Interstate Oil, Longreach Oil, Mid-
Eastern Oil, Planet Oil, Oil Search,
and Woodside (Lakes Entrance) Oil.
The search for other valuable minerals
is no less hazardous than the search for
oil, and in recognition for this there
are deductions allowed for money sub-
scribed to various companies engaged
in prospecting for metals such as tin,
lead, copper, nickel, etc. The deduc-
tion allowed in these cases is dependent
to some extent on the company itself
forgoing the deduction benefits avail-
able to it, by which it can deduct
amounts spent on exploration from
future profits, when these become avail-
able. This condition also applies to
the deductions allowed for moneys paid
to oil exploration companies.
Most prospecting companies take
steps to let their shareholders get the
benefits of these deductions in order
to lighten the burden of calls and
issues; this is apparently quite effec-
tive, as the imminence of a fully deduc-
tible call or issue can make a share
more attractive for those speculators
with fairly high taxable incomes.
Mineral exploration companies which
had calls and issues during the year
just past for which full deductions are
allowed are restricted to two —Gold and
Mineral Exploration and Planet Metals.
There were several other mining
companies which had calls and issues
during the year for which a full deduc-
tion is not available. These were:
Cleveland Tin, Oil and Minerals Quest,
Planet Gold, Renison, United Uranium,
and Western Mining Corporation.
Even with these companies, share-
holders are allowed to claim one-third
of any calls paid, which were 18 cents
in the case of Cleveland Tin, 24 cents
in Oil and Minerals Quest, 48 cents
for Planet Gold, $1 for Renison, 20
cents for United Uranium, and 60 cents
for Western Mining Corporation.
(Cleveland Tin and Western Mining
Corporation are also making calls early
in July, as is Metals Exploration, and
all of these calls will be allowed as a
deduction as to one-third in the cur-
rent income year.)
This deduction of one-third applies
to all companies which are principally
engaged in mining or prospecting oper-
ations in Australia for gold, silver, base
metals, rare minerals or oil (and, in-
deed, afforestation). The interpretation
which is placed on the wording of this
Section 78 (1) (b) of the tax legislation
is quite narrow. It restricts the deduc-
tion to shares in the actual company
which does the mining or the explor-
ation, and calls paid to holding com-
panies which finance exploration or
mining subsidiaries are not allowed as
deductions.
Thus, calls on shares in Kathleen
Investments (Australia) do not carry
any tax concession, as it does not under-
take mining itself. For this reason calls
on Hamersley Holdings have no tax
concession, either. In 1964, Renison
took the generous step of liquidating
its operating subsidiary, Renison Associ-
ated Tin Mines N.L., so that its
shareholders would be able to
claim this one-third deduction on
calls. For any company in such a
position, where likely expansion could
require the raising of money from
shareholders, the benefits of such a
step are obvious, as the cost of making
this benefit available to shareholders
is virtually nothing.
The two sections of the tax Act
which allow full deductions of capital
moneys Subscribed to companies by way
of capital expired on June 30 last. It
is to be hoped that their renewal will
be a formality only.
Commodities
Tungsten prices to
stay firm
THE U.S. GOVERNMENT’S release
of tungsten ore will continue without
limitation “as long as sales ... do not
have an undue impact on the market.’
The present price, 344/- a long-ton
unit, will also remain unchanged.
There had been fears, before the latest
statement, that sales might have been
restricted, at last with an export ban.
This news will take some of the
pressure off the world free market for
the metal. But a fall in prices except
for a marginal adjustment - is
unlikely. It is unlikely, largely because
the good news from Washington is
balanced by the deteriorating situation
in Peking.
Three and a half years ago, when
the world price of wolfram and scheehte
(the main tungsten ores) was languish-
ing below the cost of production at
about 80/- a unit, China began to cut
its sales. This was generally believed

to have been a deliberate move to
restore prices to reasonable levels. How-
ever, it was also felt that technical
problems at the mines may have played
a part.
At any rate, it seems clear that the
reduced offering of ore at the Canton
Fair earlier this year was due to cir-
cumstances beyond the control of
China’s authorities. As the country’s
internal unrest appears to be continuing,
supplies will probably not improve this
year.
The U.S. disposals place an effective
ceiling on world markets at about the
present 370/- a long-ton unit. Fortu-
nately for the good of both users and
miners of the metal, U.S. stocks are
sufficient for at least seven years, even
allowing for consumption growth and
no lift in production. Over the past year
the stockpile agency has sold over 9
million lb. of tungsten ore; about 140
million lb. of surplus material is still
held.
RUBBER HAS so far been the only
commodity (excluding tramp ships) to
be noticeably affected by the Suez
Canal closure. Apart from few ship-
loads of rubber caught in the canal,
the lengthened “pipeline” around
southern Africa means hard times for
Fmropean users for several weeks. As
a result the London rubber market,
which had lost more than 6d a lb. in
the past two or three years, lifted about
3|d a lb. beginning late in May and
ending late last month.
Reaction, and arrival of first ship-
ments from the longer route, have
brought prices back more than
since.
The basic rubber position is still not
good, however, despite a further
planned cut in U.S. stockpile releases.
Disposals will be limited to 70,000 tons
a year as from this month, against
120,000 tons last year and 145,000 tons
before that.
However, Malaysian production, de-
spite slim profits, still rises steadily, with
high-yielding trees lifting output and
cutting costs. The U.S. supply re-
duction may do prices some good when
the present disturbance has ended.
CUTS IN THE prices of major syn-
thetic fibres, including nylon and ICl’s
terylene, played a definite part in re-
duced buyer interest at recent wool
auctions. And despite sharpening com-
petition in international markets for
man-made fibres, the result of consider-
able over-capacity, further strong ex-
pansion in capacity is expected in the
nex t 18 months.
Expansion planned in over 40 coun-
tries would lift end-1968 capacity for
man-made fibres 48 percent above
1966’s actual production which was
m turn 7.9 percent above 1965. World
man-made fibre capacity in March
this year was 16,386 m. lb., against pro-
duction last year of 12,779 m. lb. and
expected capacity of 18,927 million lb.
by late 1968.
World capacity to produce synthetic
fibres acrylic (Courtelle, orlon, etc.),
polyester (terylene, etc.), and nylon,
but not the cellulosic fibres, rayon and
acetate by December, 1968, is ex-
pected to be 83 percent above 1966’s
output, which was 21 percent above
the 1965 level. Capacity in March was
about 7722 million lb. and is expected
to be 9975 million by December, 1968.
The U.K. industry is expected to lift
productive capacity to 111 percent over
1966’s production, against 88 percent
in the U.S. Polyester fibres (terylene,
etc.) are expected to lead the world
trend, with a 114 percent gain over
1966 output with U.S. producers
planning capacity 162 percent above
last year’s output. In contrast, rayon
and acetate actual output in 1966 was
virtually steady at 7321 m. lb., with
capacity at March of 8664 m. lb. ex-
pected to be lifted to only 8952 m. by
end-1968.

THE CURRENT production of Sheridan's “The
School for Scandal” at Sydney’s Old Tote Theatre
is part of the curriculum for the third-year advanced
course at the National Institute of Dramatic Art.
The eight NIDA graduates doing the course
have gone back to school after at least a year of
professional acting. Seven are in “The School for
Scandal”; the other is on tour.
“We’ve worked in television, toured with the
Young Elizabethans, been on radio, and on stage,”
said one of them, Charles Little. “Some of us have
been in films. We are professionals, and we’ve picked
up faults as well as polish.”

The third-year course has become possible because of grants
totalling $lO,OOO from the N.S.W. Government through the
Cultural Grants Committee. The students are paid $l6 a week
while they are doing the course, but during the eight weeks’ run
of “The School for Scandal” they get, as well, the minimum rate
of $6O a week.
The play’s producer, Robin Love joy, who is also a tutor for
NIDA, believes that the postgraduate school is the biggest step
taken toward establishing a professional repertory company.

THE LAND
The pricing puzzle of wheat
By the RURAL EDITOR
AT A PRESS conference in Canberra,
the chairman of the Australian Wheat
Board, Dr. A. R. Callaghan, was asked
if he could explain the fact that Red
China had paid cash for her most
recent purchase of Australian wheat.
Dr. Callaghan said he could not, and
added: “Your guess is as good as mine.”
This is an invitation we cannot pass
up.
There are two possible explanations
and you may take your pick.
One, which seems to have emanated
from Department of Trade circles in
Canberra, is that it was a pointer to
the takeover of Hong Kong by China.
Conveniently, the Reds staged demon-
strations in Hong Kong about the time
this theory was advanced. Red China
has large holdings of foreign exchange
in Hong Kong and London. If, so the
theory goes, China was about to take
-Dr. Callaghan: Your guess as good
Hong Kong, she would first use up
the sums held there, as these could be
frozen by the British in the event of
invasion. Well, this seems all right, but
so far Red China has not invaded Hong
Kong.
This brings us to the, second theory
an d this is that Australia offered a
substantial discount for cash, which
Wa s accepted by the Chinese. The
aiotive would have been twofold,
u t, a § O °H sa ie would relieve us of
{ he possibility of the largest carry-
°ve _ r in history and, second, it was
desirable to get this sale through before
jhe completion of the Kennedy Round
in Geneva. The sale did, in fact,
beat the completion of the Kennedy
Round by about a fortnight.
The Kennedy Round, it will be
remembered, came up with a recom-
mendation that a world minimum price
be based on $1.73 (American) a
bushel for U.S. No. 1 Hard Winter
Ordinary, f.o.b. Gulf ports. Trans-
lating this to Australian currency and
Australian wheats, the price becomes
about $1.44 (Australian) for our f.a.q.
wheat. It seems very doubtful that
we have ever sold wheat to China at
anything like this price. The old
international agreement base price was
about $1.16. There has even been
some opinion expressed in the United
States that we have sold cheaper.
There would be no need for this
kind of guesswork if the Wheat Board
revealed prices paid by China. It never
has. It has released round figures,
say $9O million, for round quantities,
say 1,500,000 tons (the most recent
China sale); this simply means that
1,500,000 tons should bring in $9O mil-
lion after the Australian taxpayer has
paid his subsidy on that part of the
wheat covered by the guaranteed cost
of production ($1.55 a bushel). The
Treasury advances to the wheat
stabilisation fund, between 1953 and
1966, inclusive, exceeded $lOO million.
We will know the 1967 contribution at
Budget time.
It is possible, however, to work back
through wheat export figures and con-
tributions from the Treasury to the
wheat stabilisation fund and to deduce
that sales to China over the past five
seasons (not counting the present one)
have ranged between $1.25 and $1.35
a bushel. This, obviously, is well short
of the $1.44 we agreed to at Geneva
and which, somehow, was supposed to
be a victory for wheat exporters.
Had we, at the very time the Ken-
nedy talks were nearing completion,
entered into a big sale, on generous
credit terms, to China at anything well
below $1.44, then perhaps someone
might have queried our sincerity. It was
well known by wheat traders through-
out the world prior to the China sale
that we were anxious to sell a large
quantity. The same delegation which
completed the China sale had, a week
or two earlier, visited Japan and this
had been reported fairly fully in the
Japanese Press.
No mention was made in these reports
of large quantities of “off-grade” wheat.
Yet when the China sale was announced
it was suggested that the shipments
would include quantities of “off-grade.”
The “off-grade” wheats would be a
legitimate reason for offering a con-
cession. We seem to have had rather
large amounts of “off grade” available
in recent years to send to China. And
it is a good thing, of course, that the
Wheat Board did dispose of the wheat
to China, because otherwise we would
have been holding (and trying to store
somewhere) the carryover from the all-
time record harvest of nearly 462
million bushels.
As it is, the Wheat Board has already
sold 277 million bushels and the wheat
year does not end until November 30
(another reason why it is difficult to
pin down wheat prices the financial
year for wheat is not the same as the
financial year for the Treasury and the
taxpayer). It leaves, between now and
November, about 100 million bushels
to be sold. While large enough, it is,
as Dr. Callaghan says, not “unmanage-
able.”
What would it have been without the
two sales to China this season, totalling
122 million bushels?
And how concessional was the second
of the sales a month ago?
Until the Treasury (i.e., taxpayer)
contribution to the wheat fund is
announced, not this year but next year
(due to the overlapping of the financial
year and the wheat year), we will not
know unless the Board tells us, and
that seems unlikely. By August, 1968,
it will be a long time ago in most
people’s minds.

Calculating the
drought rate
WITH DROUGHT persisting piti-
lessly and extensively throughout
South-Eastern Australia we should dis-
cuss the subject, depressing though it
may be. Let it be said at the outset
that, despite computers, sophisticated
mathematical procedures, the ever-
lengthening record of weather and
farming conditions in this country, and
even the claims of clairvoyants, we still
do not have the slightest idea when
or where to expect a drought.
The Commonwealth Bureau of
Meteorology, however, believes it has
found a way of calculating the number
of droughts to expect per century in
the different regions of Australia. This
may not be much help, yet it is about
all that we have at present.

5003 SC
and a colleague, J. V. Maher, say
that drought occurs in an area
when the annual rainfall is in the
lowest tenth of its recorded annual
variability the first decile in their
language. From this realisation they
can calculate, for example, that it is
highly improbable that all of Austra-
lia will be parched by drought at any
one time.
But drought can prevail over half
the continent once in every 50 years.
Likewise, they have deduced that for
20 years in each century the whole
country will be completely free of
drought. They expect Tasmania to
enjoy 74 drought-free years in any
one century, but Western Australia
would have only 46. The other States,
on an individual basis, could expect to
fall somewhere between these extremes.
About once in a hundred years the
whole area comprising New South
Wales, Victoria, and Tasmania will be
seared simultaneously. This could be
that one occasion, except that the
northern half of New South Wales has
generally received good falls during
the past few months. On the other
hand, South Australia has had very
little rain since last spring.
Gibbs and Maher have also applied
their system to smaller areas, such as
half a State, and found that it still
works. It would, therefore, seem to
be only a matter of painstaking work
to provide an estimate of drought fre-
quency for every district.
To help them derive their guide to
the frequency of occurence of droughts,
Messrs. Gibbs and Maher had reliable
records from more than 10,000 stations
scattered across the continent to work
with. All of these had figures going back
longer than 75 years and most of them
went beyond 100 years. The station at
Adelaide, incidentally and surprisingly,
has the longest unbroken record. Rain-
fall figures have been kept there since
1839.
Mr. Maher has also attempted to
find an answer to the question that
nags every farmer once a dry spell has
set in: will the rain keep on staying
away? Unfortunately, the answer
seems to be “yes.” This conclusion has
been reached after a study of rainfall
figures at 31 stations. Mr. Maher
looked at the monthly figures for runs
when the rainfall was on the low side.
He found that “in almost all cases the
average lengths of run were significantly
greater than would be expected in a
random series (without persistence).”
There is little joy to be had from
noting that Australia does not hold the
world record for aridity. Our driest
area is the north-eastern part of South
Australia. Mulka Station, for instance,
which lies in that region, recorded only
five inches of rain in the four years
1926-30. In comparison, Arica, in
northern Chile, can point to a 15-year
period when absolutely no rain fell.
Our worst drought since European
settlement persisted over a seven-vear
period (1895-1902) and covered four
States. The sheep population dropped
50 million during this disaster. The
early years of the 1940 decade con-
stituted another period of almost con-
tinental drought. In 1944, Victoria
which is usually a relatively well-
watered corner of the country, har-
vested only 1.63 bushels of wheat per
acre. The 1964-66 drought in northern
New South Wales, Queensland, and
Central Australia was also among our
most devastating. Total losses due to it
have been put at the huge figure of
$3OOO million. Bad though conditions
are at present in southern New South
Wales, Victoria, Tasmania, and South
Australia, they could get a lot worse;
after looking at the dismal record of
drought one might be led to pronounce
that they will.
If you are one of those who must
prod at an aching tooth and want to
read more about drought, get your-
self a copy of Bulletin No. 48 which
was issued recently by the Common-
wealth Bureau of Meteorology. It is
intended for farmers, pastoralists, busi-

nessmen, and anyone else wishing to
learn about a subject of prime impor-
tance to the Australian economy. Per-
haps some graziers are unaware that
the University of New England, for a
small charge, will assist them to draw
up a plan to meet the next drought.
Its Farm Management Service Centre
is equipped with computers to calcu-
late how much fodder is economic for
a farmer in any particular district to
reserve against drought. By writing to
Professor John L. Dillon, Agricultural
Economics, University of New Eng-
land, Armidale, SN, N.S.W., farmers
may find what facts and figures about
their property he will need in order
to carry out the computations. He has
already published a “Guidebook
which purports to describe how to ca -
culate the best-bet fodder reserve, but
unless you have a head for mathe-
matics you may have difficulty in
comprehending it. Good luck!

Trying hard to like Australia
By GEOFFREY DUTTON
Their Shining Eldorado. Elspeth Hux-
ley. Chatto & Windus. $6.15.
THE SEASON IS well and truly open
for the Australian bird-watchers. They
come from England, Russia, the U.S.A.,
Switzerland, Hungary, even Sydney.
And what sort of bird do all these
observers find we most closely re-
semble? The galah? The drongo? The
butcher-bird? The hardhead? The
greater bustard? Each makes his, or
her, own choice, but I would suggest
the common sparrow. Like us, it is
imported, huddles together with its
own color in cities, is noisy, drab,
greedy, cocky, and common.
But if you have a big page to cover
with a color plate, or a fat book to fill
Italian migrants ... con amore
with words, it is best to ignore the
sparrow, which behaves pretty much
the same in London, Leningrad, or Los
Angeles, and observe the marvellous or
the exotic or the brilliant, the lyre-
bird, the mallee-hen, or the rainbow
lorikeet. The latest, and one of the
most painstaking, of the observers is
Elspeth Huxley, who has written a book
of 382 solidly printed pages on Aus-
tralia, base,d on an extensive journey
all over the continent. She was well
briefed, and not only met people of
all levels who could tell her the truth
about things but also read a lot of
background material, which she skil-
fully renders down for those (most of
the world’s population) who know little
or nothing about Australia. The photo
on the flap of the jacket shows her
clutching a koala, determinedly raising
the ghost of a smile, dressed for an
English winter.
Her book will not tell well-informed
Australians anything more than they
already know, but it will be a very
useful guide for non-Australians, pro-
vided they read her foreword, where
she engagingly says: “I have not tried
to give a balanced picture.” One must
agree with her, as she has already
admitted: “There are whole areas of
Australian life I did not even try to
sample.” She goes on to mention edu-
cation, law, politics, organised labor,
religion, business, industry, foreign
policy, the armed forces. (Literature
and art get a couple of pages.) There
does not seem to be much left except
the flora and fauna, the Aborigines, a
bit of history, and, most of all, the
Great Outback.
Yet this is a salutary book for any
city-dwelling Oz to read, and not only
to remind him, as Mrs. Huxley fre-
quently does, that Australia’s native
flora and fauna are being destroyed at
horrifying speed, and that our total
area of wildlife reserves and national
parks is pitifully small. With humilia-
tion and dismay an Old Australian
must agree with a Spanish migrant,
the naturalist Harry Frauca, when he
says to Mrs. Huxley: “What the Aus-
tralians are doing to their country is
unbelievable.”
Mrs. Huxley, though she is always
polite and has not written a knocking
book, would certainly agree with
Frauca. And not just about natural
resources and wildlife. It is the people,
us, who really get her dowm, though
she tries hard to like us, and obviously
Alice Springs ... ugliness
Elspeth Huxley...well briefed
is impressed by various genuinely dis-
tinguished Australians she met, as also
by ordinary people who have made a
go of difficult jobs. But “Their Shin-
ing Eldorado” is a glum book, and the
title (from a poem of Lawson’s) has
an irony added to the sadness of the
ending of Lawson’s poem, “The mighty
Bush with iron rails/Is tethered to the
world.” Mrs. Huxley has valiantly and
conscientiously fulfilled her commission
to write a book about Australia, but she
has not been able to like us. The
Awful Anglo-Saxon has got her down.
The only times she writes con amore
are about Italian or Greek migrants,
and only nature sends any poetic feel-
ing into her writing. It is mostly our
fault, not hers. That is why it would
be salutary for Australians to read this
book.
It is instructive to see what things
do get her down. The Australian Ugli-
ness, of course. Not only Surfers
Paradise, “a visual nightmare,” but the
tourist shops in Alice Springs, the
shacks on the lovely beaches, the poker
machines in the clubs, the litter in
city and country, the Aboriginal
humpies on Victoria River Downs.
Next, the Un-Sex Life of Australians.
She was taken to the Musicians’. Club
in Broken Hill (a club for drinking
and poker machines, not music), a
male, sanctuary to which women are
admitted only on certain days, and
into one compartment. I knew my visit
was a privilege.”
She had a soft drink in the bar at
Coolyar, in Queensland, where by
State law women are not allowed in
bars. She pitied the loneliness an
discomfort Australian women endure
almost anywhere back of Bourke. She


noted, with accuracy, the disinterest of
the Australian male in the game of
sex, “this persistent streak of puritan-
ism in a breed of males in other ways
s 0 bold, so adventurous, and so self-
indulgent. A Victorian view of sex,
almost defunct elsewhere, remains
ingrained and predominant.” She also
had the sense to listen to a man in
Broken Hill who blamed the women:
“They don’t try to interest the men.
If a man approaches them, nine times
out of ten they’ll snub the poor bloke.”
But she also listened to a woman
whose comment was: “It may be true
that we don’t try hard enough to
interest the men. But if it comes to
that, what does interest Australian
men? Sport, union politics, cars.”
Other things quite rightly got her
down. Our dismal failure to make
any variety of cheeses out of all our
good cream. The monotony of our
food and the toughness of our steaks.
The uniformity of our dress. Our
disinclination to risk our own capital
on new ventures.
It is all too true. We have done a
lot in our less than two hundred years
here, but we have evolved a life in
which beauty, gaiety, elegance, and
splendor have been regarded as sub-
versive. There is, howevar, one colossal
proviso, and it is the major flaw in
Mrs. Huxley’s book. The young
generation don’t go at all for Awful
Anglo-Saxon Drabness. Mrs. Huxley is
old enough to have a son of twenty-
three, and most of the “young” people
she talks to are married couples with
a child or two. The voices of Aus-
tralians up to twenty-one or so are
scarcely heard in her book.
Ringing telephone
By MARIA WOLKOWSKY
My Contemporaries. Jean Cocteau.
Owen. $5.45.
COCTEAU’S CELEBRITY scrapbook
bulges with wickedly entertaining pic-
tures of what he called his favorite
“sacred monsters.” These are impres-
sionistic verbal snapshots filtered
through Cocteau’s own very personally
colored lenses. As Margaret Crosland,
the excellent editor and translator,
writes in a foreword, “He preferred
wen and women to be larger than life,
somewhat unreal, for to him their
unreality was often the clue to the
secrets of their personality.”
This collection has strengthened my
°wn conviction that he can best be
understood as a figure straight out of
jhe commedia dell’arte Goldoni’s
Servant of Two Masters” or Strauss-
Hofmannsthal’s “Ariadne.” One of the
nrst to recognise this was Picasso. Half
u century ago he asked Cocteau to sit
or him. The result, as the latter
rather ruefully points out in this book,
J' as something that “couldn’t possibly
be recognised”—he appears as a cubist
figure in harlequin costume. The sig-
nificance of such a true and uncannily
perceptive portrait does not seem to
have occurred to Coctgau, but it is
the obvious explanation for the con-
flicting verbal portraits painted of him
by his many acquaintances, from the
black villain of Maurice Sachs’ des-
tructive “Le Sabbat” to “Octave” in
Proust’s masterpiece in which Cocteau
is said not to have recognised himself,
either.
Before he died, in 1963, Cocteau had
served not merely two but many
masters, from films to poetry, from
cartoons over large canvases to prose,
Jean Cocteau ... harlequin
plays, ballet, and criticism. It is not
surprising that this profusion of talent
made him suspect to many and that
he seems to have been called anything
from high-grade charlatan to low-grade
magician.
Cocteau’s Colette is variously “a
thin fox in cycling costume,” her mouth
like a circumflex, her eyes like a proud
lioness (when caged in bed with
arthritis), or an emancipated figure
with bare feet and sandals eating an
onion, modelling herself on nature, a
Joan of Arc come to liberate female
writers.
A turning point in the author’s life
was the invasion of Paris by the
Ballet Russes. He was taken under
Diaghilev’s wing and was thrillingly
commanded: “Surprise me!”
Cocteau depicts both Diaghilev and
Nijinsky as two free men who were
exempt from the “Socratic trial
brought against us by society.” His
Nijinsky is an ugly little monkey-man,
perfectly deformed for his profession
as a dancer, whose real stature became
apparent only on stage.
Proust is seen in a vivid succession
of shots against a cluttered Edward-
ian background, in his cork-lined
room, surrounded by dustsheets and
phials, in bed, or wearing gloves, with
or without a beard, eating noodles
standing up, smelling of naphthalene.
Perhaps Cocteau’s own attitude is
best summed up in his words “Proust
was like a lamp lit in broad daylight,
the ringing of a telephone in an empty
house.” Meaning, I take it, that there
was no one at that time who could
really appreciate Proust’s greatness
except Cocteau.

Faber. $3.05.
Stranger in the Land. Michael Pereira.
Bles. $2.65.
The Road to Nowhere. G. M. Glaskin.
Barrie & Rockliff. $3.15.
ON THE BACK jacket of “The
Waiting Room” Wilson Harris’ pre-
vious six novels receive high praise in
sentences abstracted from leading Eng-
lish reviews. Two of the quotations
mention poetry: “less a novel than a
poetic experience”; “the daring of a
born poet.”
“The Waiting Room” (80 pages) is
no longer than a novella. I have read
it twice. I do not understand it
properly; cannot admire it; dislike the
many gimmicks, typographical and
otherwise, which infest it, and, truth-
fully, cannot say whether, of its kind,
it is good or bad. I found it im-
possible to respond to blind Susan,
to her absent (dead?) lover, or to what
I could decipher of their situation. To
some extent the separated relationship,
particularly in the concluding section,
reminds one of Voss and Laura, but
fantasy here is not set against (and
made more fantastic by) a firm frame-
work of realism.
Of its kind unequivocally first rate
is Michael Pereira’s “Stranger in the
Land.” It is an expertly constructed,
expertly written “middlebrow” novel
set in Burma. Luke Smith, its central
character, is an elderly Englishman on
the eve of retirement who is faced with
an agonising dilemma.
During the war, while escaping from
advancing Japanese, Smith met a
Burmese girl, who bore his son. Should
he, before he returns to England, see
this boy and admit his fatherhood?
His friend the Indian doctor Pali, who
knows both men well, thinks he should.
Ba Tu, the son, is about to make a
decision influenced by uncertainties as
to his parentage. Burmese politics com-
plicate the issues. The author knows
Burma, its people, customs, and village
life, and his book is both interesting
and enthralling. Pereira also has a
rare skill with dialogue and can suit his
conversations both to individuals and
occasions with an uncommon flair.
“The Road to Nowhere” is a col-
lection of eleven short stories and two
short novels whose overall tone is of
rather “sick” suspense. There are
echoes of Roald Dahl (but without
Dahl ’s\ macabre humor) and, oddly, of
Walter de la Mare because one tale,
“The Return,” recalls de la Mare’s
far more enchanting “Lucy.” Glaskin
writes well, organises materials well,
and very well understands children and
young adults. But his tales lack some-
thing warmth and true compassion,
I think.


Sex appeal
By CATHERINE DE LA ROCHE
The Celluloid Sacrifice. Alexander
Walker. Michael Joseph. $4.45.
FOUNDED ON THE proposition that
“the dominant motif in cinema has
been sex appeal,” this book deals with
a subject that also dominates much
literature and has selling power in any
medium. Nobody could appreciate this
better than the author, who, writing
as shrewdly as he chose his theme, has
authority, wit, and an original
approach. Walker, London “Evening
Standard” critic since 1960, has a racy
style, sophisticated sense of humor, and
enthusiasm for the cinema.
In the first and largest part of his
book he examines the greatest female
sex symbols and the nature of their
appeal. All the appraisals are made up
from biography, psychology, and
criticism, but those of the, early stars,
seen in long perspective, are more
closely related to their social and cul-
tural backgrounds. The origins of
Theda Bara’s archetype “vamp,” for
instance, are traced to a pre-Raphaelite.
painting and a poem by Kipling.
Clara Bow’s “It” girl was modelled
on the heroine of a novel by Elinor
Glyn, who chose Miss Bow for the role
because, apparently, besides the right
kind of gamine vivacity, she had
affinities with the romantically flirta-
tious heroines of Mrs. Glyn’s earlier
books. Two generations are thus linked
in a prototype of the jazz age. The,
tremendous impact made during her
brief film career by Mae West, “a sex
goddess, who mocks the very qualities
she dangles be,fore the public,” is
clearly and most wittily placed in his-
torical context.
Marlene Dietrich and Greta Garbo,
on the other hand, both initially
moulded by their directors and endowed
with mysterious personalities, are pre-
sented on a biographical background,
little related to the contemporary social
Theda Bara ... archetype
Garbo ... mysterious personality
or literary trends., As far as they go,
however, these chapters are admirable.
Mr. Walker aptly describes Miss Diet-
rich’s most characteristic role as that
of a femme fatale for whom “love
usually goes with loyalty,” if not to a
man, then at least to a code of life,
“a military code.” I am sure he is
also right in suggesting that Garbo’s
art often conformed to Stanislavsky’s
method and in citing “the famous
furniture-touching sequence in ‘Queen
Christina’ ” as an example. Perhaps the
most sensitive passages are those devoted
to Marilyn Monroe in the chapter
“Body and Soul.” Noting the basic
innocence she never lost, the author
writes of the talent she developed “for
playing against the sex appeal of her
body.”
The second part of the book examines
the effect censorship in Britain and
the United States has had on screen
morals. It points out recent trends on
both sides of the Atlantic the in-
creasingly advisory functions of the
British censors and the changes in
Hollywood following the “morality
crisis” of 1964-65, which led not only
to proposals for modernising the in-
dustry’s self-regulating Production Coda
but also to modifications in the Legion
of Decency, renamed the National
Catholic Office for Motion Pictures.
In the third part of his book the
Mae West ... sex goddess
Monroe ... basic innocence
author occasionally drags his coat-
tails, analysing the changing relation-
ships in sex comedies, where the hero
has become “a sacrificial victim of
female domination.” Mr. Walker’s study
of Hollywood sex comedies as reflec-
tions of social trends, notably the
matriarchal ones, is masterly, and
women who want men worth having
should read it attentively.

Letters to the Intimate Theatre. Strind-
berg. Owen. $6.60.
The Son of a Servant. Strindberg.
Cape. $5.80.
IT IS HIGHEST time someone
admitted that contemporary writing
has been helping itself liberally to
Strindberg, without acknowledgement.
But at least one result is that the
greatest Swedish dramatist, dead for
more than half a century, is being
rediscovered. It was only this year,
after some seasons of “Virginia-
Woolfing” with Albee, that it seems to
have dawned on English audiences that
grim chuckles and gasps of laughter
at its direct predecessor, “The Dance
of Death” (with Sir Laurence Olivier
as dancer-in-chief), are not simply
de rigueur, but positively invited.
In releasing these two books now,
the publishers have correctly gauged
the pulse of the moment: the mature
“Letters to the Intimate Theatre” have
never before appeared in English, and
the earlier “Son of a Servant,” the
first volume of Strindberg’s autobiog-
raphy, has been given a new, up-to-
the-minute translation. Both will con-
tribute enormously, in different ways,
to the understanding of this strange,
crazy, contradictory genius. As a P a | r >

similar: “The Son” is a portrait of a

sensitive boy beating against a closed
door; the “Letters” are the outpour-
ings of a great dramatist’s lifetime of
theatrical know-how, containing such
revolutionary ideas about staging that
we have still not entirely caught up
with him.
Despairing of having his plays per-
formed by the big established theatres
that demanded a standard five acts of
artificiality, preferably in verse, with
long intervals for hard drinking,
Strindberg had made several attempts
to run a small company of his own.
It was not until the idealistic efforts
of young producer.-actor August Falck
that the experimental “Intimate” was
opened with “The Pelican” in 1907.
Despite the narrow-minded, hostile
Stockholm critics, the theatre kept
going for the three years that were
to help change the face of modern
production for a century.
The five lengthy “Letters” are in-
tended, for the most part, as directions
to the “Intimate” actors. But one must
not expect to read Strindberg on
Strindberg here, except in a few rare
cases. He did not believe in keeping
his players in a strait jacket nor
did he think that there was only one
way to interpret a role. So he de-
liberately stuck to universal truths,
which with him often took the form
of analyses of the dramas of
Shakespeare, whom he liked to call
his teacher and master. His staff was
left to draw the necessary parallels for
their own use.
The translator, Scandinavian scholar
Professor Walter Johnson, of the
University of Washington, has supple-
mented the “Letters” with excellent
introductions and notes. One of his
hobby-horses is the mistranslation of
“Lady Julie” as “Miss Julie,” which
distorts the whole social significance of
the play. Strindberg himself called it
his “Figaro” (Beaumarchais’, not da
Ponte’s) in which he intended to stress
the changing concepts of class
distinction. There is no need for Pro-
fessor Johnson to apologise to Aus-
tralian readers for what he terms an
outdated account of the Swedish
National Theatre crisis. With its refer-
ences to lottery subsidies, committee
bungling, inadequate buildings and
opera performances it strikes a
strangely familiar and topical note.
The autobiographical “The Son of
a Servant” is a darkly Dickensian third-
Person tale of an oppressed, unhappy
childhood, complete with wicked step-
mother and tyrannical father. The
editor and translator Evert Sprincßorn
does not doubt that Strindberg deliber-
ately blackened and embroidered the
truth with rich fantasy, while admit-
tlng that plain facts often do not speak
correctly unadorned. His main pur-
pose here is to convey, as his sub-title
states, “The Story of the Evolution of
a Human Being 1849-1867,” that is,
the formative influences from his birth
t° his late teens.

"Fighting vets"
“Fighting vets” (8., July 1) does
not give an entirely accurate view of
negotiations which I have had on this
particular subject.
In the first place I would like to
emphasise that I have a very keen
awareness of the training and skills of
a modern veterinarian and I have
gained this knowledge from personal
experience of the help that has been
provided by many veterinarians on my
own farm.
In the course of the correspondence
that I have had with members of the
Australian Veterinary Association and
others, two matters arose. There was a
suggestion that the Australian Army
Veterinary Corps should be re-
established. A close inquiry did not
reveal that the re-establishment of this
Corps would provide needed skills and
services which are not already covered
by Army Medical Officers, e.g., the
study of human diseases transmitted
from or by animals is a normal part
of medical teaching.
It is also suggested that there could
be a use for Veterinary Officers be-
cause of the danger of returning troops
bringing new diseases into this
country. This, of course, is something
within the province of the Department
of Health, and the Army at all times
co-operates with that Department which
closely and jealously guards Australia
from overseas diseases. There are
specific Military Board instructions
which ensure that all Health Depart-
ment requirements are carried out by
the Army at all times.
I have had some additional cor-
respondence concerning the possible
employment of trained veterinary
officers who may be called up for
National Service. As I have indicated
it is doubtful if the Army has any pos-
itions where the skills of veterinary
graduates can be used to the full. This
is a position held in common with
other professions. I have already
advised the Veterinary Association that
if otherwise acceptable, and wherever
possible, we will employ veterinary
graduates in certain Royal Australian
Army Medical Corps officers’ appoint-
ments. I pointed out that they could
not be employed professionally as
Veterinary Officers but their back-
ground knowledge would be useful for
many administrative and technical
aspects of medical corps activity.
More recently I have had corres-
pondence with members of the Associ-
ation concerning the possibility of using
trained veterinary graduates in the new
Army Civil Affairs Unit in Vietnam.
While I cannot prejudge what the out-
come will be I have indicated that I
am examining this matter and have,
in fact, given specific instructions to
Colonel McDonagh, Officer in Charge
of the Civil Affairs Unit, to advise me
of the possibility of usefully employing
trained specialists not only in the vet-
erinary field but in other fields. I will
be discussing this with him when I visit
Vietnam later this month.

Ties in Asia
The statement in the “Economist”
report in your June 24 issue
that Tunku Abdul Rahman, Prime
Minister of Malaysia, is disenchanted
with regional togetherness is very far
from the truth. As recently as June 7
the Malaysian Government gave major
emphasis to the possibility of a new
South-East Asian regional body. Tun
Razak, the Foreign Minister, said “We
have always believed in regional co-
operation.” Musa bin Hitam, the
executive secretary of UMNO, the
dominant political party in Malaysia,
confirmed this in a private conversation
with me in Perth recently. The Malay-
sian Government would go along with
anyone working for this, he said, what-
ever the shape of the proposal, with no
sense of wounded pride at the com-
parative lack of success of the Tunku’s
ASA. He confirmed my feeling that
the Tunku, with his pragmatic attitude,
was still very interested in regional
associations.
Similarly, your comment that “the
only organisation started in Asia which
has succeeded in making co-operation
work, is the Colombo Plan,” is most
inaccurate. The Colombo Plan of course
was initiated by Europeans, and maybe
this is a subtle way of both denigrating
Asians and of patting ourselves on the
back; but ECAFE is only one orga-
nisation that is making co-operation
work in Asia in a far more significant
way than the Colombo Plan, and there
are many others, at numerous levels and
in many fields of endeavor.

Higham's Sydney
Although I have spent most of my
life in Sydney, I had some difficulty
in recognising the many different
parts of this city as described in
“Sydney ’67.”
The practice of using one or more
adjectives with almost every noun i n
a long description, must cloud the
average reader’s mind. When, as in this
article, the adjectives seem to be
plucked without regard, from a vast
reservoir, then the picture emerging
must be somewhat distorted.
Why should the bush on the North
Shore be described as “unkempt” when
a few miles away, on the Middle
Harbor, it is an “infinity of smoky
olive-colored trees.” Does Mr. Higham
happen to live on Middle Harbor?
One other question—when West
Sydney is described as a “surprisingly
warm experience” does it mean that
it is lOdeg. F. better there in the
summer than anywhere else?
A. R. Elmslie
Parramatta, N.S.W.
What a pity Charles Higham left a
vacant space in his charming and
warming portrait of Sydney ’67 (8.,
June 24). Agreed, Charles, you word-
painted a fine, personal, and poetic
appreciation of the world’s best city
in which to live—see the other cities,
but live in Sydney.
But might I suggest the Editor give
you a week off —the dollars and cents
for a hydrofoil trip to Manly or,
better still, go by slow ferry, which
has more charm.
This week would not be wasted if
it produced for The Bulletin another
piece on Sydney to take in the Harbor
itself and that most beautiful area of
Sydney from Manly to Palm Beach,
the forest, lake, and Pittwater area,
which are all part of it.
Sydney has no greater beauty to
offer than the majestic sweep of the
northern beaches and headlands, the
quiet, snug bays, like North Harbor
and the city, contemplated from
North Head or Georges Heights.
The Peninsula has its ugly side, too
-—mostly man-made —but to finish the
Sydney picture let Mr. Higham loose.
We would like to read his piece. No
Sydney picture is complete without
this area deftly delineated, and Mr-
Higham has “the eye” and the woids
to do it.

of the controversy must surely be “So
what?” This severely truncated
approach to the question of capital
inflow has been thoroughly discredited
by now, mainly because it completely
ignores in its efforts to establish the
inevitability of Mr. Horsfall’s “built-
in strains” the effects of capital
inflow on other components of the bal-
ance of payments. It is obviously neces-
sary, but certainly not sufficient, to
consider the amount of income payable
to overseas investors; the amount of
exports flowing from those investments,
or the amount of imports replaced as
a result, are at least as important in
the arithmetic. Surely a glance at the
current figures for mineral exports
and the size of contracts for future
years demonstrates the futility of
the simple inflow/dividends compari-
son? I hope Croesus isn’t losing his
touch.

British pull-out
Donald Horne’s realistic appraisal of
the situation which will be created by
Britain’s withdrawal from “East of
Suez” can only be faulted on one point.
He designates the retention of any
British naval and air forces as being
“almost irrelevant to the main security
problems of the area.”
By the 1970 s Britain should have
four Polaris submarines plus six
nuclear-powered conventional submar-

not be on the land. Such a presence
should be on the sea or under the

Poor Anne Boleyn
In many, many years, countless friends
and enemies of Queen Elizabeth I have
been striving to prove this or that
about her mother, Anne Boleyn.
F. J. Lilias (8., June 17) takes Ross
Campbell to task for his generous
summing-up of Anne’s character in his
review of the film “A Man For All
Seasons.”
I’m on Ross Campbell’s side. A
psychologist could have much to say
in Anne’s defence. By modern ideas she
was pathetically naive in all the
abominable iniquities of Henry’s day
and age. In that hell-fire one might as
well be burned for a sheep as a lamb.
Alas, poor Anne!
The little I have read makes me
all for Ross Campbell’s compassionate,
humorous pen. Poor Anne Boleyn!
J. E. Neale, Astor Professor of Eng-
lish in the University of London in
his searching and scholarly book on
Queen Elizabeth I had this to say:
“Against her mother’s shame there
always stood a large interrogation
mark; and if Catholic writers later re-
membered and embroidered her
wickedness, Protestant writers extolled
her virtues . . .
“In the four days between her trial
and execution, Cranmer had to find
cause for nullifying her marriage, thus
reducing Elizabeth to the status of a
bastard. It mattered little that it was
illogical to condemn and execute for
adultery a woman who had never been
a wife. Henry was not averse to hav-
ing it both ways . . . Henry was only
forty-five. . . . He could start again
on his quest for a son.”
Anne was not a person of no
importance; as Professor Neale says:
“Anne Boleyn gave birth to a child at
the pleasant river palace of Greenwich.
Its destiny was bound up with acci-
dents of State, which none could then
foretell; but this at least might have
been discerned, that the birth was a
symbol of the most momentous revo-
lution in the histoi'y of the country.”

Without strings
I have been interviewed on the subject
of violins by quite a few leading
Sydney journalists, who have published
interesting articles. They had the
manners to arrange an appointment
for such an interview.
The lady who wrote your article
(8., July 1) fired questions at me
(during the time I was trying to con-
duct business) with a very rude
manner of questioning.
Also I am not “the woman at
Smith’s.” I am a member of the
International Society of Violin Makers
and a master violin, viola, and cello
maker, and a musician.

Dream homes
In your article “The Dream Home
Business” you have my relationship to
Pettit & Sevitt all wrong. Firstly, lam
an independent consulting architect, a
partner in the firm of Ancher, Mort-
lock, Murray & Woolley, not, as you
say, part of the Pettit & Sevitt estab-
lishment. I emphasise this only because
it has pioneered a very satisfactory
working relationship with builder and
architect acting as a team. The
approval of this idea initiated the
Royal Australian Institute of Archi-
tects Award for project houses. Sec-
ondly, the successful “Lowline” is my
work, whereas you say that I came m
three years afterward.
